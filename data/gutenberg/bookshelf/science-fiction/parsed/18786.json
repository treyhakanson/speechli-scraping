Behind him, Tom Corbett and Roger Manning\nlounged on the dormitory bunks, watching their unit mate blast the\nfreshman cadets and trying to keep from laughing. It wasn't long ago\nthat they had gone through the terrifying experience of being hazed by\nstern upperclassmen and they knew how the three pink-cheeked boys in\nfront of them felt.\n\n\"So,\" bawled Astro, \"you want to blast off, do you?\"\n\nNeither of the three boys answered.\n\n\"Speak when you're spoken to, Mister!\" snapped Roger at the boy in the\nmiddle.\n\n\"Answer the question!\" barked Tom, finding it difficult to maintain his\nrole of stern disciplinarian.\n\n\"Y-y-yes, sir,\" finally came a mumbled reply.\n\n\"What's your name? And don't say 'sir' to me!\" roared Astro.\n\n\"Coglin, sir,\" gulped the boy.\n\n\"Don't say 'SIR'!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir--er--I mean, O.K.,\" stuttered Coglin.\n\n\"And don't say O.K., either,\" Roger chimed in.\n\n\"Yes ... all right ... fine.\" The boy's face was flushed with\ndesperation.\n\nAstro stepped forward, his chin jutting out. \"For your information,\" he\nbawled, \"the correct manner of address is 'Very well.'\"\n\n\"Very well,\" stammered Coglin.\n\nAstro shook his head and turned back to Tom and Roger. \"Have you ever\nseen a greater display of audacity and sheer gall?\" he demanded. \"The\nnerve of these three infants assuming that they could ever become Space\nCadets!\"\n\nTom and Roger laughed, not at the three Earthworms, but at Astro's\nsudden eloquence. The giant Venusian cadet usually limited his comments\nto a gruff Yes or No, or at most, a garbled sentence full of a veteran\nspaceman's oaths. Then, resuming his stern expression, Roger faced the\nthree boys.\n\n\"Sound off! Quick!\" he demanded.\n\n\"Coglin, John.\"\n\n\"Spears, Albert.\"\n\n\"Duke, Phineas.\"\n\n\"You call those _names_?\" Roger snorted incredulously. \"Which of you\nground crawlers is radar officer?\"\n\n\"I am, very well,\" replied Spears.\n\nThe blond-haired cadet stared at him in amazement.\n\n\"Very well, what?\" he demanded.\n\n\"You said that's the correct form of address,\" replied Spears doggedly.\n\nRoger turned to Tom. \"Well, thump my rockets,\" he exclaimed, \"I didn't\nknow they made them that dumb any more!\"\n\n\"Who is the command cadet?\" asked Tom, suppressing a grin.\n\n\"I am, very well,\" replied Duke.\n\n\"How fast is fast?\"\n\n\"Fast is as fast must be, without being either supersonic or turgid.\nFast is necessarily that amount of speed that will not be the most nor\nthe least, yet will be sufficient unto the demands of fast ...\" Duke\nquoted directly from the _Earthworm Manual_, a book that was not\nprescribed learning in the Academy, but woe unto the Earthworm who did\nnot know it by heart when questioned by a cadet upperclassman.\n\n\"What is a blip on a radar, Mister?\" demanded Roger of Spears.\n\n\"A blip is never a slip. It is constant with the eye of the beholder,\nand constant with the constant that is always--\" Spears faltered, his\nface flushing with embarrassment.\n\n\"Always what?\" hounded Roger.\n\n\"I--I don't know,\" stammered the fledgling helplessly.\n\n\"_You don't know?_\" yelled Roger. He looked at Tom and Astro, shaking\nhis head. \"He doesn't know.\" The two cadets frowned at the quivering boy\nand Roger faced him again. \"For your information, Mr. Spears,\" he said\nat his sarcastic best, \"there are five words remaining in that sentence.\nAnd for each word, you will spend one hour cleaning this room. Is that\nclear?\"\n\nSpears could only nod his head.\n\n\"And for your further information,\" continued Roger, \"the remaining\nwords are 'constantly alert to constant dangers'! Does that help you,\nMister?\"\n\n\"Yes, Cadet Manning,\" gulped Spears. \"You are very kind to give me this\ninformation. And it will be a great honor to clean your room.\"\n\nAstro stepped forward to take his turn. He towered over the remaining\ncadet candidate and glowered at the thoroughly frightened boy. \"So,\" he\nroared, \"I guess this means you're going to handle the power deck in one\nof our space buckets, eh?\"\n\n\"Yes, very well,\" came the quavering, high-pitched reply.\n\n\"Give me the correction of thrust when you are underway in a forward\nmotion and you receive orders from the control deck for immediate\nreversal.\"\n\nCoglin closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and the words poured from\nhis lips. \"To go forward is to overtake space, and to go sternward is to\nretake space already overtaken. To correct thrust, I would figure in the\nbeginning of my flight how much space I intended to take and how much I\nwould retake, and since overtake and retake are both additional\nquotients that have not been divided, I will add them together and\narrive at a correction.\" The cadet candidate stopped abruptly, gasping\nfor breath.\n\nSecretly disappointed at the accuracy of the reply, Astro grunted and\nturned to Tom and Roger. \"Any questions before they blast off on their\nsolo hop?\" he growled.\n\nThe two cadets shook their heads and Roger quickly lined three chairs in\na row. Tom addressed the frightened boys solemnly. \"This is your\nspaceship. The first chair is the command deck; second, radar deck;\nthird, power deck. Take your stations and stand by to blast off.\"\n\nSpears, Coglin, and Duke jumped into the chairs and Tom walked around\nthem eying them coldly. \"Now, Misters,\" he said, \"you are to blast off,\nmake a complete circle of the Earth, and return to the Academy spaceport\nfor a touchdown. Is that clearly understood?\"\n\n\"All clear,\" chorused the boys.\n\n\"Stand by to raise ship!\" bawled Tom.\n\n\"Power deck, check in!\" snapped Duke from the first chair. \"Radar deck,\ncheck in!\"\n\n\"Just one moment, Mister,\" interrupted Roger. \"When you issue an order\nover the intercom, I want to see you pick up that mike. I want to see\nall the motions. It's up to you, Misters, to make us believe that you\nare blasting off!\"\n\n\"Very well,\" replied Duke with a nervous glance back at his unit mates.\n\n\"Carry on!\" roared Tom.\n\nThen, as Tom, Roger, and Astro sprawled on their bunks, grinning openly,\nthe three Earthworm cadets began their simulated flight through space.\nGoing through the movements of operating the complicated equipment of a\nspaceship, they pushed, pulled, jerked, snapped on imaginary switches,\nread unseen meters and gauges, and slammed around in their chairs to\nsimulate acceleration reaction. The three cadets of the _Polaris_ unit\ncould no longer restrain themselves and broke into loud laughter at the\nantics of the aspirants. Finally, when they had landed their imaginary\nship again, the Earthworms were pounded on the back heartily.\n\n\"Welcome to Space Academy!\" said Tom with a grin. \"That was as smooth a\nride as I've ever had.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" agreed Astro, pumping Coglin's hand. \"You handled those reactors\nand atomic motors like a regular old space buster!\"\n\n\"And that was real fine astrogation, Spears,\" Roger chimed in. \"Why, you\nlaid out such a smooth course, you never left the ground!\"\n\nThe three Earthworms relaxed, and while Astro brewed hot cups of tea\nwith synthetic pellets and water from the shower, Tom and Roger told\nthem about the traditions and customs of the Academy.\n\nTom began by telling them how important it was for each crew member to\nbe able to depend on his unit mate. \"You see,\" he said, \"in space there\nisn't much time for individual heroics. Too many things can happen too\nfast for it to be a one-man operation.\"\n\n\"I'll say,\" piped up Roger. \"A couple of times I've been on the radar\ndeck and seen a hunk of space junk coming down on us fast. So instead of\nfollowing book procedure, relaying the dope to Tom on the control deck\nto pass it on to Astro, I'd just sing out to Astro direct on the\nintercom, 'Give me an upshot on the ecliptic!' or 'Give me a starboard\nshot!' and Astro would come through because he knows I always know what\nI'm talking about.\"\n\n\"Not always, hot-shot!\" growled Astro. \"How about the time we went out\nto Tara and snatched that hot copper asteroid out of Alpha Centauri's\nmouth? _You_ said the time on that reactor blast should be set at--\"\n\n\"Is that so?\" snapped Roger. \"Listen, you big overgrown hunk of Venusian\nspace gas--\" Roger got no further. Astro grabbed him by the shirt front,\nheld him at arm's length, and began tickling him in the ribs. The three\nfreshmen cadets backed out of the way, glancing fearfully at the giant\nVenusian. Astro's strength was awesome when seen for the first time.\n\n\"Lemme go, you blasted space ape!\" bellowed Roger, between fits of\nlaughter.\n\n\"Say uncle, Manning!\" roared Astro. \"Promise you won't call me names\nagain, or by the stars, I'll tickle you until you shake yourself apart!\"\n\n\"All right--un-un-uncle!\" managed Roger.\n\nAstro dropped his unit mate on a bunk like a rag doll and turned back to\nTom with a shrug of his shoulders. \"He'll never learn, will he?\"\n\nTom grinned at Duke. \"Astro's like a big overgrown puppy.\"\n\n\"Someone ought to put him on a leash,\" growled Roger, crawling out of\nthe bunk and rubbing his ribs. \"Blast it, Astro, the next time you want\nto show off, go play with an elephant and leave me alone.\"\n\nAstro ignored him, turning to Coglin. \"As much as I gas Roger,\" the\ngiant cadet said seriously, \"I'd rather ride a thrust bucket with him on\nthe radar deck than Commander Walters. He's the best.\"\n\nTom smiled. \"That's what I mean, Duke. Astro believes in Roger, and\nRoger believes in Astro. I believe in them, and they in me. We've got\nto, or we wouldn't last long out there in space.\"\n\nThe three fledgling spacemen were silent, watching and listening with\nawe and envy as the _Polaris_ crew continued their indoctrination. They\nconsidered themselves lucky to have been drawn by these famous cadets\nfor their hazing. The names of Corbett, Manning, and Astro were becoming\nsynonymous with great adventure in space. But, with all their\nhairbreadth escapes, the _Polaris_ unit was still just learning its job.\nThe boys were still working off demerits, arguing with instructors on\ntheory, listening to endless study spools, learning the latest advanced\nmethods of astrogation, communication, and reactor-unit operation. They\nwere working toward the day when they would discard the vivid blue\nuniforms of the Space Cadet Corps and don the magnificent black and gold\nof the Solar Guard.\n\nTom was aware of the eager expressions on the faces of the Earthworms\nand he smiled to himself. It was not a smile of smugness or conceit, but\nrather of honest satisfaction. More than once he had shaken his head in\nwonder at being a Space Cadet. The odds against it were enormous. Each\nyear thousands of boys from all the major planets and the occupied\nsatellites competed for entrance to the famed Academy and pitifully few\nwere accepted. And he was happy at having two unit mates like Roger\nManning and Astro to depend on when he was out in space, commanding one\nof the finest ships ever built, the powerful rocket cruiser _Polaris_.\n\nAs Roger and Astro continued to talk to the fledglings, Tom sipped his\ntea and thought of his own first days at the Academy. He remembered his\nfear and insecurity, and how hard he had fought to make what was then\nUnit 42-D a success, the unit that eventually became the _Polaris_ unit.\nAnd how each assignment had brought him closer to his dream of becoming\nan officer in the Solar Guard.\n\nHe got up and walked to the window and looked out across the Academy\ncampus, over the green lawns and white buildings connected by the\nrolling slidewalks, to the gleaming crystal Tower, the symbol of man's\nconquest of space. And beyond the Tower building, Tom saw a spaceship\nblasting off from the spaceport, her rockets bucking hard against thin\nair as she clawed her way spaceward. When it disappeared from sight, he\nfollowed it with his mind's eye and it became the _Polaris_, his ship!\nHe and Roger and Astro were blasting through the cold black void, their\nown personal domain!\n\nA loud burst of laughter behind him suddenly brought Tom back to Earth.\nHe smiled to himself and shook his head, as though reluctant to leave\nhis dream world. He glanced out of the window again, this time down at\nthe quadrangle, and far below he recognized the squat, muscular figure\nof Warrant Officer Mike McKenny drilling another group of newly arrived\ncadet candidates. Tom saw the slidewalks begin to fill with boys and men\nin varicolored uniforms, all released from duty as the day drew to a\nclose. Tonight, Astro, Roger, and he would go to see the latest stereo,\nand tomorrow they would blast off in the _Polaris_ for the weekly\ncheckout of her equipment. He turned back to Spears, Coglin, and Duke.\nRoger was just finishing the story of their latest adventure (described\nin _The Revolt on Venus_).\n\n\"The best part, of course, was the actual hunting of the tyrannosaurus,\"\nsaid Astro.\n\n\"A tyrannosaurus?\" exploded Spears, the youngest and most impressionable\nof the three Earthworms. \"You actually hunted for a dinosaur?\"\n\nAstro grinned. \"That's right. They're extinct here on Earth, but on\nVenus we catch 'em and make pets out of the baby ones.\"\n\n\"We could have saved ourselves a lot of trouble, though,\" commented\nRoger mockingly. \"We have several officers here that would have served\njust as well. Major 'Blast-off' Connel, for instance, the toughest,\nmeanest old son of a hot rocket you have ever seen!\"\n\n\"_Stand to!_\"\n\nThe six boys nearly broke their backs jumping to attention. A squat,\nmuscular figure, wearing the black-and-gold uniform of a Solar Guard,\nstrode heavily into their line of vision. Roger gulped as Major Connel\nstopped in front of him. \"Still gassing, eh, Manning?\" he roared.\n\n\"'Evening, Major, sir,\" mumbled Roger, his face beet red.\n\"We--er--ah--were just telling this Earthworm unit about the Academy,\nsir. Some of its pitfalls.\"\n\n\"Some of the cadets are going to fall into a pit if they don't learn to\nkeep their mouths shut!\" snapped Connel. He glared at Tom, Astro, and\nRoger, then wheeled sharply to face the three quaking freshmen cadets.\n\"You listen to anything they tell you and you'll wind up with a book\nfull of demerits! What in blazes are you doing here, anyway? You're\nsupposed to be at physical exams _right this minute!_\"\n\nThe three boys began to shake visibly, not knowing whether to break\nranks and run or wait until ordered.\n\n\"Get out of here!\" Connel roared. \"You've got thirty seconds to make\nit. And if you _don't_ make it, you'll go down on my bad-rocket list!\"\n\nAlmost in one motion, the three cadet candidates saluted and charged\nthrough the door. When they had gone, Connel turned to the _Polaris_\ncadets who were still at attention. \"At ease!\" he roared and then\ngrinned.\n\nThe boys came to rest and smiled back at him tentatively. They never\nknew what to expect from Connel. \"Well, did you put them through their\npaces?\" he asked as he jerked his thumb toward the door.\n\n\"Yes, sir!\" said Tom.\n\n\"Did they know their manual? Or give you any lip when you started giving\nthem hot rockets?\" Connel referred to the hazing that was allowed by the\nAcademy, only as another of the multitude of tests given to cadets.\nCadet candidates might possibly hide dangerous flaws from Academy\nofficials but never from boys near their own ages.\n\n\"Major,\" said Astro, \"those fellows came close to blasting off right\nhere in these chairs. They really thought they were out in _space!_\"\n\n\"Fine!\" said Connel. \"Glad to hear it. I've singled them out as my\npersonal unit for instruction.\"\n\n\"Poor fellows,\" muttered Roger under his breath.\n\n\"What was that, Manning?\" bellowed Connel.\n\n\"I said lucky fellows, sir,\" replied Roger innocently.\n\nConnel glared at him. \"I'll bet my last rocket that's what you said,\nManning.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nConnel turned to the door and then spun around quickly to catch Roger\ngrinning at Astro.\n\n\"'Poor fellows,' wasn't it?\" said Connel with a grin. Roger reddened\nand his unit mates laughed. \"Oh, yes,\" continued Connel, \"I almost\nforgot. Report to Commander Walters on the double. You're getting\nspecial assignments. I recommended you for this job, so see that you\nbehave yourselves. Especially you, Manning.\"\n\nHe turned and disappeared through the doorway, leaving the three cadets\nstaring at each other.\n\n\"Wowie!\" yelled Astro. \"And I thought we were going to get chewed up for\nkeeping those Earthworms too long!\"\n\n\"Same here,\" said Roger.\n\n\"Wonder what the assignment is?\" said Tom, grabbing his tunic and racing\nfor the door. Neither Roger nor Astro answered as they followed on his\nheels. When they reached the slidestairs, a moving belt of plastic that\nspiraled upward to an overhead slidewalk bridge connecting the dormitory\nto the Tower of Galileo, Tom's eyes were bright and shiny. \"Whatever it\nis,\" he said, \"if Major Connel suggested us for it, you can bet your\nlast reactor it'll be a rocket buster.\"\n\nAs the boys stepped on the slidestairs that would take them to Commander\nWalters' office, each of them was very much aware that this was the\nfirst step to a new adventure in space. And though the three realized\nthat they could expect danger, the special assignment meant that they\nwere going to hit the high, wide, and deep again. And that was all they\nasked of life. To be in space, a spaceman's only real home!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\n\n\"Gentlemen, please!\"\n\nCommander Walters, the commandant of Space Academy, stood behind his\ndesk and slammed his fist down sharply on its plastic top. \"I must\ninsist that you control your tempers and refrain from these repeated\noutbursts,\" he growled.\n\nThe angry voices that had filled the room began to subside, but Walters\ndid not continue his address. He stood, arms folded across his chest,\nglaring at the assembled group of men until, one by one, they stopped\ntalking and shifted nervously in their chairs. When the room was finally\nstill, the commander glanced significantly at Captain Steve Strong,\nstanding at the side of the desk, smiled grimly, and then resumed in a\ncalm, conversational tone of voice.\n\n\"I am quite aware that we have departed from standard operational\nprocedure in this case,\" he said slowly. \"Heretofore, the Solar Guard\nhas always granted interplanetary shipping contracts to private\ncompanies on the basis of sealed bids, the most reasonable bid winning\nthe job. However, for the job of hauling Titan crystal to Earth, we have\nfound that method unsatisfactory. Therefore, we have devised this new\nplan to select the right company. And let me repeat\"--Walters leaned\nforward over his desk and spoke in a firm, decisive voice--\"this\ndecision was reached in a special executive session of the Council of\nthe Solar Alliance last night.\"\n\nA short, wiry man suddenly rose from his chair in the front row, his\nface clearly showing his displeasure. \"All right, get on with it,\nWalters!\" he snapped, deliberately omitting the courtesy of addressing\nthe commander by his title. \"Don't waste our time with that 'official'\nhogwash. It might work on your cadets and your tin soldiers, but not on\nus!\"\n\nThere was a murmur of agreement from the assembled group of men. Present\nwere some of the wealthiest and most powerful shipping magnates in the\nentire Solar Alliance--men who controlled vast fleets of commercial\nspaceships and whose actions and decisions carried a great deal of\nweight. Each hoped to win the Solar Guard contract to transport Titan\ncrystal from the mines on the tiny satellite back to Earth. Combining\nsteellike strength and durability with its great natural beauty, the\ncrystal was replacing metal in all construction work and the demand was\nenormous. The shipping company that got the job would have a guaranteed\nincome for years to come, and each of the men present was fighting with\nevery weapon at his command to win the contract.\n\nHeartened by the reaction of the men around him, the speaker pressed\nhis advantage. \"We've all hauled cargo for the Solar Guard before, and\nthe sealed-bid system was perfectly satisfactory then!\" he shouted. \"Why\nisn't it satisfactory now? What's all this nonsense about a space race?\"\n\nAgain, the murmur filled the room and the men glared accusingly at\nWalters. But the commander refused to knuckle down to any show of\narrogance. He fixed a cold, stony eye on the short man. \"Mr. Brett,\" he\nsnapped in a biting voice, \"you have been invited to this meeting as a\nguest, not by any right you think you have as the owner of a shipping\ncompany. A guest, I said, and I ask that you conduct yourself with that\nsocial obligation in mind!\"\n\nBefore Brett could reply, Walters turned away from him and addressed the\nothers calmly. \"Despite Mr. Brett's outburst, his question is a good\none. And the answer is quite simple. The bids submitted by your\ncompanies were not satisfactory in this case because we believe that\nthey were made in bad faith!\"\n\nFor once, there was silence in the room as the men stared at Walters in\nshocked disbelief. \"There are fourteen shipping companies represented in\nthis room, some of them the most respected in the Solar Alliance,\" he\ncontinued, his voice edged with knifelike sarcasm. \"I cannot find it in\nmy conscience to accuse all of you of complicity in this affair, but\nnevertheless we are faced with one of the most startling coincidences I\nhave ever seen.\"\n\nWalters paused and looked around the room, measuring the effect of his\nwords. Satisfied, he went on grimly, \"There isn't enough difference\nbetween the bids of each of you, not _five credits'_ worth of\ndifference, to award the contract to any single company!\"\n\nThe men in the room gasped in amazement.\n\n\"The bids were exactly alike. The only differences we found were in\noperational procedure. But the cost to the Solar Guard amounted to, in\nthe end, exactly the same thing from each of you! The inference is\nclear, I believe,\" he added mockingly. \"Someone stole the minimum\nspecifications and circulated them among you.\"\n\nIn the shocked quiet that followed Walters' statement, no one noticed\nTom, Roger, and Astro slip into the room. They finally caught the eye of\nCaptain Strong, who acknowledged their presence with a slight nod, as\nthey found seats in the rear of the room.\n\n\"Commander,\" a voice spoke up from the middle of the group, \"may I make\na statement?\"\n\n\"Certainly, Mr. Barnard,\" agreed Walters, and stepped back from his desk\nas a tall, slender man in his late thirties rose to address the men\naround him. The three Space Cadets stared at him with interest. They had\nheard of Kit Barnard. A former Solar Guard officer, he had resigned from\nthe great military organization to go into private space-freight\nbusiness. Though a newcomer, with only a small outfit, he was well liked\nand respected by every man in the room. And everyone present knew that\nwhen he spoke, he would have something important to say, or at least\nadvance a point that should be brought to light.\n\n\"I have no doubt,\" said Barnard in a slow, positive manner, \"that the\ndecision to substitute a space race between us as a means of awarding\nthe contract was well considered by the Solar Council.\" He turned and\nshot Brett a flinty look. \"And under the circumstances, I, for one,\naccept their decision.\" He sat down abruptly.\n\nThere were cries of: \"Hear! Hear!\" \"Righto!\" \"Very good!\"\n\n\"No!\" shouted Brett, leaping to his feet. \"By the craters of Luna, it\nisn't right! I demand to know exactly who submitted the lowest bid!\"\n\nWalters sighed and shuffled through several papers on his desk. \"You are\nwithin your rights, Mr. Brett,\" he said, eying the man speculatively.\n\"It was you.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Then why in blue blazes didn't I get the contract?\" screamed Brett.\n\n\"For several reasons,\" replied Walters. \"Your contract offered us the\nlowest bid in terms of money, but specified very slow schedules. On the\nother hand, Universal Spaceways Limited planned faster schedules, but\nat a higher cost. Kit Barnard outbid both of you in money and schedules,\nbut he has only two ships, and we were doubtful of his ability to\ncomplete the contract should one of his ships crack up. The other\ncompanies offered, more or less, the same conditions. So you can\nunderstand our decision now, Mr. Brett.\" Walters paused and glared at\nthe man. \"The Solar Council sat in a continuous forty-eight-hour session\nand considered _everyone_. The space race was finally decided on, and\nvoted for by every member. Schedules were the most vital point under\nconsideration. But other points could not be ignored, and these could\nonly be determined by actual performance. Now, does that answer all your\nquestions, Mr. Brett?\"\n\n\"No, it doesn't!\" yelled Brett.\n\n\"Oh, sit down, Brett!\" shouted a voice from the back of the room.\n\n\"Yes! Sit down and shut up!\" called another. \"We're in this too, you\nknow!\"\n\nBrett turned on them angrily, but finally sat down, scowling.\n\nIn the rear of the room Tom nudged Roger. \"Boy! The commander sure knows\nhow to lay it on the line when he wants to, doesn't he?\"\n\n\"I'll say!\" replied Roger. \"That guy Brett better watch out. Both the\ncommander and Captain Strong look as if they're ready to pitch him out\non his ear.\"\n\nSix feet tall, and looking crisp, sure, and confident in his\nblack-and-gold uniform, Captain Steve Strong stood near Walters and\nscowled at Brett. Unit instructor for the _Polaris_ crew and Commander\nWalters' executive officer, Strong was not as adept as Walters in\nmasking his feelings, and his face clearly showed his annoyance at\nBrett's outbursts. He had sat the full forty-eight hours with the\nCouncil while they argued, not over costs, but in an effort to make sure\nthat none of the companies would be slighted in their final decision. It\nmade his blood boil to see someone like Brett selfishly disregard these\nefforts at fairness.\n\n\"That is all the information I can give you, gentlemen,\" said Walters\nfinally. \"Thank you for your kind attention\"--he shot an ironic glance\nat Brett--\"and for your understanding of a difficult situation. Now you\nmust excuse me. Captain Strong, whom you all know, will fill in the\ndetails of the race.\"\n\nAs Walters left the room, Strong stepped to the desk, faced the\nassembly, and spoke quickly. \"Gentlemen, perhaps some of you are\nacquainted with the present jet car race that takes place each year? The\nforerunner of that race was the Indianapolis Five-Hundred-Mile Race of\nsome few hundred years ago. We have adopted their rules for our own\nspeed tests. Time trials will be held with all interested companies\ncontributing as many ships that they think can qualify, and the three\nships that make the fastest time will be entered in the actual race.\nThis way we can eliminate the weaker contenders and reduce the chance of\naccidents taking place millions of miles out in space. Also, it will\nresult in a faster time for the winner. Now, the details of the race\nwill be given to your chief pilots, crew chiefs, and power-deck officers\nat a special meeting in my office here in the Tower building tomorrow.\nYou will receive all information and regulations governing the minimum\nand maximum size of the ships entered, types of reactor units, and\namount of ballast to be carried.\"\n\n\"How many in the crew?\" asked a man in the front.\n\n\"Two,\" replied Steve, \"or if the ship is mostly automatic, one. Either\ncan be used. The Solar Guard will monitor the race, sending along one of\nthe heavy cruisers.\" Strong glanced at his notes. \"That is all,\ngentlemen. Are there any questions?\"\n\nThere were no questions and the men began to file out of the room.\nStrong was relieved to see Brett was among the first to leave. He didn't\ntrust himself to keep his temper with the man. As the room emptied,\nStrong stood at the door and grabbed Kit Barnard by the sleeve. \"Hello,\nspaceman!\" he cried. \"Long time, no see!\"\n\n\"Hello, Steve,\" replied Kit, with a slow, warm smile.\n\n\"Say! Is that the way to greet an old friend after four, or is it five\nyears?\"\n\n\"Five,\" replied Kit.\n\n\"You look worried, fellow,\" said Strong.\n\n\"I am. This race business leaves me holding the bag.\"\n\n\"How's that?\"\n\n\"Well, I made a bid on the strength of a new reactor unit I'm trying to\ndevelop,\" explained Kit. \"If I had gotten the contract, I could have\nmade a loan from the Universal Bank and completed my work easily. But\nnow--\" Kit stopped and shook his head slowly.\n\n\"What is this reactor?\" Strong asked. \"Something new?\"\n\n\"Yes. One quarter the size of present standard reactors and less than\nhalf the weight.\" Kit's eyes began to glow with enthusiasm as he spoke.\n\"It would give me extra space in my ships and be economical enough on\nfuel for me to be able to compete with the larger outfits and their\nbigger ships. Now, all I've got is a reactor that hasn't been tested\nproperly, that I'm not even sure will work on a long haul and a hot\nrace.\"\n\n\"Is there any way you can soup up one of your present reactors to make\nthis run?\" asked Strong.\n\n\"I suppose so,\" added Kit. \"I'll give the other fellows a run for their\nmoney all right. But it'll take every credit I have. And if I don't win\nthe race, I'm finished. Washed up.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, Captain Strong,\" said Tom Corbett, coming to attention.\n\"Major Connel ordered us to report here for special assignment.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Strong, turning to Tom, Roger, and Astro with a smile.\n\"Meet Kit Barnard. Kit--Tom Corbett, Roger Manning, and Astro, the\n_Polaris_ unit. My unit,\" he added proudly.\n\nThe boys saluted respectfully, and Barnard smiled and shook hands with\neach of them.\n\n\"You've heard about the race now,\" said Strong to Tom.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied the young cadet. \"It sounds exciting.\"\n\n\"It will be, with spacemen like Kit Barnard, Charley Brett, and the\nother men of the big outfits competing. You're going to work with me on\nthe time trials, and later the _Polaris_ will be the ship that monitors\nthe race. But first, you three will be inspectors.\"\n\n\"Of what, sir?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"You'll see that all regulations are observed--that no one gets the jump\non anyone else. These men will be souping up their reactors until those\nships will be nothing but 'go,' and it's your job to see that they use\nonly standard equipment.\"\n\n\"We're going to be real popular when we tell a spaceman he can't use a\nunit he's rigged up specially,\" commented Astro with a grin.\n\nTom laughed. \"We'll be known as the cadets you love to hate!\"\n\n\"Especially when you run up against Charley Brett,\" said Kit.\n\nThe cadets looked at the veteran spaceman inquiringly, but he was not\nsmiling, and they suddenly felt a strange chill of apprehension.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\n\n\"It's about time you got here!\"\n\nCharley Brett glared angrily at his chief pilot, Quent Miles, as he\nsauntered into the office and flopped into a chair.\n\n\"I had a heavy date last night. I overslept,\" the spaceman replied,\nyawning loudly.\n\n\"We're late for Strong's meeting over at the Academy,\" Brett snapped.\n\"Get up! We've got to leave right away.\"\n\nQuent Miles looked at the other man, his black eyes gleaming coldly.\n\"I'll get up when I'm ready,\" he said slowly.\n\nThe two men glared at each other for a moment, and finally Brett lowered\nhis eyes. Miles grinned and yawned again.\n\n\"Come on,\" said Brett in a less demanding tone. \"Let's go. No use\ngetting Strong down on us before we even get started.\"\n\n\"Steve Strong doesn't scare me,\" replied Miles.\n\n\"All right! He doesn't scare you. He doesn't scare me, either,\" said\nBrett irritably. \"Now that we both know that neither of us is scared,\nlet's get going.\"\n\nQuent smiled again and rose slowly. \"You know something, Charley?\" he\nsaid in a deceptively mild voice. \"One of these days you're going to get\nofficious with the wrong spaceman, one that isn't as tolerant as I am,\nand you're going to be pounded into space dust.\"\n\nQuent Miles stood in front of Brett's desk and stretched like a languid\ncat. Brett noted the powerful hands and arms and the depth of the\nshoulders and chest, all emphasized by the tight-fitting clothes the\nspaceman affected. The man was dark and swarthy, and dressed all in\nblack. Brett had often imagined that if the devil ever took human form\nit would look like Quent Miles. He shivered uncontrollably and waited.\nFinally Miles turned to him, a mocking smile on his face.\n\n\"Well, Charley? What are we waiting for?\"\n\nA few moments later they were speeding through the broad streets of Atom\nCity in a jet cab on the way to the Atom City spaceport.\n\n\"What's this all about?\" demanded Quent, settling back in his seat. \"Why\nthe rush call?\"\n\n\"I didn't get the contract to haul the crystal,\" replied Brett grimly.\n\"All the bids were so close the Solar Council decided to have a space\nrace out to Titan to pick the outfit that would get the job.\"\n\nQuent turned toward him, surprised. \"But I thought you had all that\nsewed up tight!\" he exclaimed. \"I thought after you got your hands on\nthe--\"\n\n\"Shut up!\" interrupted Brett. \"The details on the specifications leaked\nout. Now the only way I can get the contract is to win the race.\"\n\n\"And I'm the guy to do it?\" asked Quent with a smile.\n\n\"That's what you're here for. If we don't win this race, we're finished.\nWashed up!\"\n\n\"Who else is in the race?\"\n\n\"Every other major space-freight outfit in the system,\" replied Brett\ngrimly. \"And Kit Barnard.\"\n\n\"Has Barnard got that new reactor of his working yet?\"\n\n\"I don't think so. But I have no way of telling.\"\n\n\"If he has, you're not going to win this race,\" said Quent, shaking his\nhead. \"Nor is anyone else.\"\n\n\"You are here for one reason,\" said Brett pointedly.\n\n\"I know.\" Quent grinned. \"To win a race.\"\n\n\"Right.\"\n\nQuent laughed. \"With those heaps you've fooled people into thinking are\nspaceships? Don't make me laugh.\"\n\n\"There are going to be time trials before the race,\" said Brett. \"The\nthree fastest ships are going to make the final run. I'm not worried\nabout the race itself. I've got a plan that will assure us of winning.\nIt's the time trials that's got me bothered.\"\n\n\"Leave that to me,\" said Quent.\n\nThe jet cab pulled up to the main gate of the spaceport and the two men\ngot out. Far across the field, a slender, needle-nosed ship stood poised\non her stabilizer fins ready for flight. She was black except for a red\nband painted on the hull across the forward section and around the few\nviewports. It gave her the appearance of a huge laughing insect. Quent\neyed the vessel with a practiced eye.\n\n\"I'll have to soup her up,\" he commented. \"She wouldn't win a foot race\nnow.\"\n\n\"Don't depend too heavily on your speed,\" said Brett. \"I would just as\nsoon win by default. After all,\" he continued, looking at Miles with\ncalculating eyes, \"serious accidents could delay the other ships.\"\n\n\"Sure. I know what you mean,\" replied the spaceman.\n\n\"Good!\" Brett turned away abruptly and headed for the ship. Quent\nfollowing him. In a little while the white-hot exhaust flare from the\nrocket tubes of the sleek ship splattered the concrete launching apron\nand it lifted free of the ground. Like an evil, predatory bug, the ship\nblasted toward the Academy spaceport.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Well, blast my jets!\" Astro gasped, stopping in his tracks and\npointing. Tom and Roger looked out over the quadrangle toward the\nAcademy spaceport where ship after ship, braking jets blasting, sought\nthe safety of the ground.\n\n\"Great galaxy,\" exclaimed Tom, his eyes bulging, \"there must be a\nhundred ships!\"\n\n\"At least,\" commented Roger.\n\n\"But they can't all be here for the trials,\" said Astro.\n\n\"Why not?\" asked Roger. \"This is a very important race. Who knows what\nship might win? It pays the company to enter every ship they have.\"\n\n[Illustration: _\"Great galaxy! There must be a hundred ships!\"_]\n\n\"Roger's right, Astro,\" said Tom. \"These fellows are playing for big\nstakes. Though I don't think there'll be more than thirty or forty ships\nin the actual speed trials. See those big-bellied jobs? They're repair\nships.\"\n\n\"I hadn't thought about that,\" acknowledged the big Venusian cadet.\n\"They'll probably be jazzing up those sleek babies and that takes a lot\nof repair and work.\"\n\n\"Come on,\" said Tom. \"We've got to get over to the meeting. Captain\nStrong said he wanted us to be there.\"\n\nThe three cadets turned back toward the nearest slidewalk and hopped on.\nNone of them noticed the black ship with the red band around its bow\nwhich suddenly appeared over the field, rockets blasting loudly as it\nbegan to drop expertly to the ground.\n\nFrom early morning the skies over the Academy had been vibrating to the\nthunderous exhausts of the incoming fleet of ships. Painted with company\ncolors and insignia, the ships landed in allotted space on the field,\nand almost immediately, mechanics, crew chiefs, and specialists of all\nkinds swarmed over the space vessels preparing them for the severest\ntests they would ever undergo. The ships that actually were to make the\ntrial runs were stripped of every spare pound of weight, while their\nreactors were taken apart and specially designed compression heads were\nput on the atomic motors.\n\nThe entire corps of Space Cadets had been given a special three-day\nholiday to see the trials, and the Academy buildings were decorated with\nmulticolored flags and pennants. A festive atmosphere surrounded the\nvast Solar Guard installation.\n\nBut in his office in the Tower of Galileo, Captain Strong paced the\nfloor, a worried frown on his face. He stepped around his desk and\npicked up a paper to re-read it for the tenth time. He shook his head\nand flipped open the key of his desk intercom, connecting him with the\nenlisted spaceman in the next office.\n\n\"Find Kit Barnard, spaceman!\" Strong called. \"And give him an oral\nmessage. _Personal._ Tell him I said he can't use his reactor unit\nunless he changes it to more standard operational design.\" Strong paused\nand glanced at the paper again. \"As it stands now, his reactor will not\nbe approved for the trials,\" he continued. \"Tell him he has until\nmidnight tonight to submit new specifications.\"\n\nAs Strong closed the intercom key abruptly, the three members of the\n_Polaris_ unit stepped into his office and saluted smartly. Strong\nlooked up. \"Hello, boys. Sit down.\" He waved them to nearby chairs and\nturned back to his desk. The drawn expression of their unit commander\ndid not go unnoticed.\n\n\"Is there something wrong, sir?\" asked Tom tentatively.\n\n\"Nothing much,\" replied Strong wearily. He indicated the sheaf of papers\nin front of him. \"These are reactor-unit specifications submitted by the\npilots and crew chiefs of the ships to be flown in the time trials. I've\njust had to reject Kit Barnard's specifications.\"\n\n\"What was the matter?\" asked Astro.\n\n\"Not enough safety allowance. He's running too close to the danger point\nin feeding reactant to the chambers, using D-18 rate of feed and D-9 is\nstandard.\"\n\n\"What about the other ships, sir?\" asked Tom. \"Do they all have safety\nfactors?\"\n\nStrong shrugged his shoulders. \"They all specify standard reaction rates\nwithout actually using figures,\" he said. \"But I'm certain that their\nfeeders are being tuned up for maximum output. That's where your job is\ngoing to come in. You've got to inspect the ships to make sure they're\nsafe.\"\n\n\"Then Kit Barnard put down his specifications, _knowing_ that there was\na chance they wouldn't pass,\" Tom remarked.\n\nStrong nodded. \"He's an honest man.\"\n\nThe door opened and several men stepped inside. They were dressed in the\nmode of merchant space officers, wearing high-peaked hats, trim jackets,\nand trousers of a different color. Strong stood up to greet them.\n\n\"Welcome, gentlemen. Please be seated. We will begin the meeting as soon\nas all the pilots are here.\"\n\nRoger nudged Astro and whispered, \"What's the big deal about a D-18 rate\nand a D-9 rate? Why is that so important?\"\n\n\"It has to do with the pumps,\" replied the power-deck cadet. \"They cool\nthe reactant fuel to keep it from getting too hot and wildcatting. At a\nD-9 rate the reactant is hot enough to create power for normal flight.\nFeeding at a D-18 rate is fine too, but you need pumps to cool the\nmotors, and pumps that could do the job would be too big.\"\n\n\"Kit's problem,\" commented Tom, \"is not so much building the reactor,\nbut a cooling system to keep it under control.\"\n\n\"Will that make a big difference in who wins the race?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"With that ship of Kit's,\" said Astro, shaking his head, \"I doubt if\nhe'll be able to come even close to the top speeds in the trials unless\nhe can use the new reactor.\"\n\nThe room had filled up now and Strong rapped on the desk for attention.\nHe stared at the faces of the men before him, men who had spent their\nlives in space. They were the finest pilots and crew chiefs in the solar\nsystem. They sat quietly and attentively as Strong gave them the details\nof the greatest race of spaceships in over a hundred years.\n\nAfter Strong had outlined the plans for the time trials, he concluded,\n\"Each of you competing in the time trials will be given a blast-off time\nand an orbital course. Only standard, Solar-Guard-approval equipment\nwill be allowed in the tests. I will monitor the trials, and Space\nCadets Corbett, Manning, and Astro will be in complete charge of all\ninspections of your ships.\" Strong paused and looked around. \"Are there\nany questions?\"\n\n\"When will the first ship blast off, Captain Strong?\" asked a lean and\nleathery-looking spaceman in the back of the room.\n\n\"First time trial takes place at 0600 hours tomorrow morning. Each ship\nhas a designated time. Consult your schedules for the blast-off time of\nyour ships.\"\n\n\"What if a ship isn't ready?\" asked Kit Barnard, who had slipped into\nthe room unnoticed.\n\n\"Any ship unable to blast off at scheduled time,\" said Strong, finding\nit difficult to look at his old friend, \"will be eliminated.\"\n\nThere was a sudden murmur in the room and Quent Miles rose quickly.\n\"That's not much time to prepare our ships,\" he said. \"I don't know\nwho's going to be first, but I can't even strip my ship by tomorrow\nmorning, let alone soup up the reactant.\" His voice was full of\ncontempt, and he glanced around the room at the other pilots. \"Seems to\nme we're being treated a little roughly.\"\n\nThere were several cries of agreement.\n\nStrong held up his hand. \"Gentlemen, I know it is difficult to prepare a\nship in twelve hours for a race as important as this one,\" he said. \"But\nI personally believe that any spaceman who really wants to make it can\nmake it!\"\n\n\"Well, I'm not going to break my back to make a deadline,\" snarled\nQuent. \"And I don't think any of the other fellows here will either.\"\n\n\"If you are scheduled to blast off tomorrow at 0600 hours, Captain\nMiles,\" Strong announced coldly, \"and you are unable to raise ship, you\nwill be eliminated.\"\n\nStifling an angry retort, Quent Miles sat down, and while Strong\ncontinued to answer questions, Astro, a worried frown on his face,\nstared at the spaceman dressed in black. Tom noticed it. \"What's wrong\nwith you, Astro?\" he asked.\n\n\"That spaceman Miles,\" replied Astro. \"I could swear I know him, yet I'm\nsure that I don't.\"\n\n\"He's not a very ordinary-looking guy,\" observed Roger. \"He's plenty big\nand he's so dark that it wouldn't be easy to mistake him.\"\n\n\"Still,\" said Astro, screwing up his forehead, \"I know I've seen him\nbefore.\"\n\n\"If there are no further questions, gentlemen,\" said Strong, \"we'll\nclose this meeting. I know you're anxious to get to your ships and begin\nwork. But before you go, I would like to introduce the cadet inspectors\nto you. Stand up, boys.\"\n\nSelf-consciously, Tom, Roger, and Astro stood up while Strong addressed\nthe pilots.\n\n\"Cadet Manning will be in charge of all electronics inspections, Cadet\nAstro in charge of the power deck, and Cadet Corbett will cover the\ncontrol deck and over-all inspection of the ship itself.\"\n\nQuent Miles was on his feet again, shouting, \"Do you mean to tell me\nthat we're going to be told what we can and can't do by those three\nkids!\" He turned and glared at Tom. \"You come messing around my ship,\nbuster, and you'll be pitched out on your ear!\"\n\n\"If the cadets do not pass on your ship,\" said Strong, with more than a\nlittle edge to his voice, \"it will not get off the ground.\"\n\nThe two men locked eyes across the room.\n\n\"We'll see about that!\" growled Miles, and stalked from the room, his\nheavy shoulders swinging from side to side in an exaggerated swagger.\n\n\"I believe that's all, gentlemen,\" announced Strong coldly, \"and\nspaceman's luck to each of you.\"\n\nAfter the men had left, the three cadets crowded around Strong. \"Do you\nthink we'll have any trouble with Miles, sir?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"You have your orders, Tom,\" said Strong. \"If any ship does not meet\nstandards established for the race, it will be disqualified!\"\n\nAstro stared at the doorway through which Quent Miles had disappeared.\nHe scratched his head and muttered, \"If it wasn't for just one thing,\nI'd swear by the stars that he's the same spaceman who--\" He stopped and\nshook his head.\n\n\"Who what?\" asked Strong.\n\n\"Nothing, sir,\" said Astro. \"I _must_ be mistaken. It can't be the same\nman.\"\n\n\"I suggest that you sleep out at the spaceport tonight,\" said Strong.\n\"The first ship will have to be inspected before she blasts off, and\nthat means you will have to look her over before six.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Tom.\n\n\"And watch out for Quent Miles,\" warned Strong.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said the curly-haired cadet. \"I know what you mean.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\n\n\"The course is to Luna and return! Spaceman's luck.\"\n\nCaptain Strong's voice rasped out over the public address system as a\nlone spaceship stood poised on the starting ramp, her ports closed, her\ncrew making last-minute preparations. Ringing the huge spaceport, crews\nfrom other ships paused in their work to watch the first vessel make the\ndash around the Moon in a frantic race against the astral chronometer.\nIn the temporary grandstands at the north end of the field, thousands of\nspectators from cities all over Earth leaned forward, hushed and\nexpectant.\n\n\"Are you ready _Star Lady?_\" Strong called, his voice echoing over the\nfield.\n\nA light flashed from the viewport of the ship.\n\n\"Stand by to raise ship!\" roared Strong. \"Blast off, minus five, four,\nthree, two, one--_zero!_\"\n\nThere was a sudden, ear-shattering roar and smoke and flame poured from\nthe exhaust of the ship, spilling over the blast-off ramp. The ship\nrocked from side to side gently, rose into the air slowly, and then\ngathering speed began to move spaceward. In a moment it was gone and\nonly the echoing blasts of thunder from its exhausts remained.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"There goes number one,\" said Tom to his unit mates as they watched from\na vantage point near one of the service hangars.\n\n\"He got a pretty shaky start there at the ramp,\" commented Astro. \"He\nmust've poured on so much power, he couldn't control the ship.\"\n\n\"Heads up, fellas,\" announced Roger suddenly. \"Here comes work.\" Kit\nBarnard was walking toward them, carrying a small metallic object in his\nhand.\n\n\"'Morning, boys,\" said Kit with a weary smile. His eyes were bloodshot.\nThe cadets knew he had worked all night to revise and resubmit his\nspecification sheet to Strong.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"'Morning, sir,\" said Tom.\n\n\"I'd like to have you O.K. this gear unit. I made it last night.\"\n\nAstro took the gear and examined it closely.\n\n\"Looks fine to me,\" he said finally, handing it back. \"Part of your main\npumps?\"\n\n\"Why, yes,\" replied Kit, surprised. \"Say, you seem to know your\nbusiness.\"\n\n\"Only the best rocket buster in space, sir,\" chimed in Tom. \"He eats,\nsleeps, and dreams about machinery on a power deck.\"\n\n\"Is that for your new reactor, sir?\" asked Astro.\n\n\"Yes. Want to come over and take a look at it?\"\n\n\"Want to!\" exclaimed Roger. \"You couldn't keep him away with a ray gun,\nCaptain Barnard.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" said Kit. \"Incidentally, I'm not in the Solar Guard any more;\ndon't even hold a reserve commission, so you don't have to 'sir' me. I'd\nprefer just plain Kit. O.K.?\"\n\nThe three boys grinned. \"O.K., Kit,\" said Tom.\n\nAstro began to fidget and Tom nudged Roger. \"Think we can spare the\nVenusian for a little while?\"\n\n\"Might as well let him go,\" grunted Roger. \"He'd only sneak off later,\nanyway.\"\n\nAstro grinned sheepishly. \"If anyone wants me to check anything, I'll be\nover at Kit's. Where is your ship?\" he asked the veteran spaceman.\n\n\"Hangar Fourteen. Opposite the main entrance gate.\"\n\n\"Fine, that's where I'll be, fellows. See you later.\"\n\nWith Astro bending over slightly to hear what Kit was saying, the two\nmen walked away. Roger shook his head. \"You know, I still can't get used\nto that guy. He acts like a piece of machinery was a good-looking space\ndoll!\"\n\n\"I've seen you look the same way at your radarscope, Roger.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but it's different with me.\"\n\n\"Is it?\" said Tom, turning away so that Roger would not see him\nlaughing. And as he did, he saw something that made him pause. In front\nof the hangar, Captain Strong was talking to Quent Miles. There was no\nmistaking the tall spaceman in his severe black clothes.\n\n\"Here comes more work,\" muttered Tom. Quent had turned away from Strong\nand was walking toward them.\n\n\"Strong said I had to get you to O.K. this scope,\" said Quent with a\nsneer. \"Hurry it up! I haven't got all day.\"\n\nHe handed them a radarscope that was common equipment on small pleasure\nyachts, and was considerably lighter in weight than the type used on\nlarger freight vessels.\n\n\"What's the gross weight of your ship?\" asked Roger after a quick glance\nat the large glass tube with a crystal surface that had been polished to\na smooth finish.\n\n\"Two thousand tons,\" said Quent. \"Why?\"\n\nRoger shook his head. \"This is too small, Mr. Miles. You will have to\nuse the standard operational scope.\"\n\n\"But it's too big.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, sir--\" began Roger.\n\n\"Sorry!\" Quent exploded. \"Give me that tube, you squirt.\" He snatched it\nout of Roger's hand. \"I'm using this scope whether you like it or not!\"\n\n\"If you use that scope,\" said Tom coldly, \"your ship will be\ndisqualified.\"\n\nQuent glared at the two boys for a moment, his black eyes cold and hard.\n\"They make kids feel mighty important around here, don't they?\"\n\n\"They give us jobs to do,\" said Roger. \"Usually we can handle them fine.\nOccasionally we run into a space-gassing bum and he makes things\ndifficult, but we manage to take care of him.\"\n\nQuent stepped forward in a threatening manner, but Roger did not move.\n\"Listen,\" the spaceman snarled, \"stay out of my way, you young punk, or\nI'll blast you.\"\n\n\"Don't ever make the mistake of touching me, Mister,\" said Roger\ncalmly. \"You might find that you're the one who's blasted.\"\n\nQuent stared at them a moment, then spun on his heels and swaggered back\nto his ship.\n\n\"You know, Roger,\" said Tom, watching Miles disappear into the hangar,\n\"I have an idea he is one spaceman who'll back up his threats.\"\n\nRoger ignored Tom's statement. \"Come on. We've got a lot of work to do,\"\nhe said, turning away.\n\nThe two cadets headed for the next hangar and boarded a ship with the\npicture of a chicken on its nose. While Roger examined the\ncommunications and astrogation deck, Tom busied himself inspecting the\ncontrol deck, where the great panels of the master control board were\nstripped of everything but absolute essentials. Later, they called Astro\nback to make a careful inspection of the power deck on the ship. While\nthey waited for the Venusian cadet, Tom and Roger talked to the pilot.\n\nGigi Duarte was a small, dapper Frenchman who somehow, in the course of\nhis life, had acquired the nickname \"Chicken\" and it had been with him\never since. The cadets had met him once before when they rode on a\npassenger liner from Mars to Venusport and liked the small, stubby\nspaceman. Now, renewing their friendship, the boys and \"Gigi the\nChicken\" sat on the lower step of the air lock and chatted.\n\n\"This is the greatest thing that has happened to me,\" said Gigi. \"Ever\nsince I can remember, I have wanted to race in space!\"\n\n\"Don't get much chance when you're hauling passengers around, I guess,\"\nsaid Tom.\n\nGigi shook his head. \"One must always be careful. Just so fast, over a\ncertain route, taking all the precautionary steps for fuel! Bah! But\nthis flight! This time, I will show you speed! Watch the French Chicken\nand you will see speed as you have never--\" Suddenly he stopped and\nfrowned. \"But you cannot see me. I will be going too fast!\"\n\nTom and Roger laughed. After Astro joined them, they shook hands with\nthe Frenchman, wished him luck, and went to the next ship to inspect it.\nGigi's ship was already being towed out to the blast-off ramp, and by\nthe time the three boys had completed their inspection of the next ship,\nthe gaily colored French ship flashed the ready signal to Strong.\n\n\"Blast off, minus five, four, three, two, one--_zero!_\" Strong's voice\nboomed out over the loud-speakers and the French Chicken poured on the\npower. His ship arose from the ground easily, and in five seconds was\nout of sight in the cloudless skies above.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll day the spaceport rocked with the thunderous noise of stripped-down\nspaceships blasting off on their trial runs around the Moon. Kit Barnard\nworked like a demon to complete the cooling system in his aged ship, and\nas each ship blasted off on its scheduled run to the Moon, the time for\nhis own flight drew nearer. Kit worked with his chief crewman, Sid\nGoldberg, a serious, swarthy-faced youngster who rivaled Astro in his\nlove for the power-deck machinery on a spaceship. By nightfall, with\nTom, Roger, and Astro standing by to make their final inspection, Kit\nwiped the oil and grime from his hands and stepped back. \"Well, she's\nfinished. You can make your inspections now, boys,\" he said.\n\nWhile Tom, Astro, and Roger swarmed over the vessel, examining the newly\ndesigned and odd-looking gear, the veteran spaceman and his young helper\nstretched out on the concrete ramp and in thirty seconds were asleep.\n\nThe _Polaris_ unit quickly checked out Kit's ship as qualified for the\nrace, and then turned, fascinated, to the tangle of pipes, cables, and\nmechanical gear of the reactor unit and cooling pumps. Tom and Roger\nwere unable to figure out exactly what changes Kit had made, but Astro\ngazed at the new machinery fondly, almost rapturously. He tried to\nexplain the intricate work to his unit mates, but would stop in the\nmiddle of a sentence when a new detail of the construction would catch\nhis eye.\n\n\"Come on, Roger,\" Tom sighed. \"Let's go on to the next ship. This\nlovesick Venusian can catch up with us later.\"\n\nThey turned away and left Astro alone on the power deck, doubtful that\nhe had even noticed their departure.\n\nThe trials had been suspended at nightfall, and the ships that had\nalready blasted off left sections of the huge spaceport empty. The day\nhad been a grueling one for the cadets, and Tom and Roger climbed\nwearily on the nearest slidewalk that would take them back to the\nAcademy grounds. Just as they rode through the main field gate, Roger\nnudged Tom. \"Look! There's Quent Miles up ahead of us,\" he said. \"Isn't\nhe scheduled to blast off in the morning?\"\n\n\"Yes. Why?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"He hasn't called us in to inspect his ship yet.\"\n\n\"Maybe he isn't ready yet,\" said Tom. \"Probably still souping it up.\"\n\n\"I've been watching him. He hasn't done very much.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"He's the only one working on his ship,\" replied Roger. \"Not one\nhelper.\"\n\nTom snorted. \"You're beginning to suspect everything, Roger. He might be\ngoing to get a part or grab a bite to eat.\"\n\n\"Where? In Atom City?\" asked Roger. \"That's the slidewalk to the\nmonorail station.\" He pointed to the black-suited figure as he hopped on\nanother moving belt that angled away from theirs.\n\n\"Oh, forget it,\" groaned Tom. \"I'm too tired to think about it now.\nLet's just report to Captain Strong and get some sack time. I'm all out\nof reactant.\"\n\n\"I suppose Astro will spend half the night trying to figure out what it\ntook Kit Barnard years to build,\" mused Roger.\n\n\"And if I know Astro,\" chuckled Tom, \"he'll get it figured out too!\"\n\nAs the two weary cadets continued their ride into the Academy grounds,\non another slidewalk going in the opposite direction, Quent Miles\nwatched the darkening countryside closely. It was several miles from the\nAcademy to the monorail station, and the moving belt dipped and turned\nthrough the rugged country that surrounded Space Academy. Suddenly Quent\nstraightened, and making certain no one was watching him, he jumped off\nthe slidewalk and hurried to a clump of bushes a few hundred yards away.\nHe disappeared into the thick foliage and then reached inside his tunic\nand pulled out a paralo-ray gun.\n\n\"You in here, Charley?\" Miles whispered.\n\nThere was a movement to his left and he leveled the gun. \"All right!\nCome out of there!\"\n\nThe bushes parted and Charley Brett stepped out. \"Put that thing away!\"\nhe snarled. \"What's that for?\"\n\n\"After I got your message to meet you out here, I didn't know what was\nup, so I brought this along just in case,\" Quent replied. \"What's so\nsecret that you couldn't come to the spaceport?\"\n\n\"I've got the stuff for Kit Barnard's reactor.\"\n\n\"What stuff?\"\n\n\"This.\" Brett took a small lead container out of his pocket and handed\nit to Quent. \"This is impure reactant. Dump it into his feeders and we\ncan count him out of the race.\"\n\nQuent took the lead container, looked at it, and then stuffed it inside\nhis tunic. \"What'll happen?\"\n\n\"Nothing. He'll just get out in space and find his pumps won't handle\nthe heat from his feeders, that's all. He's the only one I'm worried\nabout.\"\n\n\"Reports are coming in from Luna City. You can worry about Gigi Duarte,\ntoo. He's burning up space.\"\n\n\"Ross is at the Luna spaceport,\" replied Brett. \"He'll take care of any\nship that looks like it's going to be too fast.\"\n\n\"Then why not have him take care of Kit Barnard too?\" demanded Quent.\n\"There will be less chance of getting caught. Remember, I've got those\nthree Space Cadets and Strong to worry about.\"\n\n\"You can't expect to get what we're after unless you take chances. Now\nget back to the spaceport and put this stuff in Barnard's feeders. You\nblast off tomorrow morning before he does and won't have much time.\"\n\n\"O.K.,\" agreed Quent. \"When did Ross get to Luna City?\"\n\n\"Yesterday. I had him come in from the hide-out.\"\n\n\"You think there'll be any cause for suspicion with him on the Moon and\nme down here?\" asked Quent.\n\n\"When you land at Luna City spaceport, he'll disappear. By that time we\nshould know how the time trials are shaping up.\"\n\n\"O.K. Where are you going now?\"\n\n\"Back to the office. I've still got some things to check on before the\nbig race. We're going to use the hide-out for that.\"\n\nA smile spread across Quent Miles' face. \"So that's it, eh? Pretty\nclever, Charley. Ross know about it?\"\n\n\"Yeah. He's leaving as soon as he knows we've won the time trials. Now\nget back to the spaceport and take care of Barnard's ship.\"\n\nQuent slipped his hand inside his tunic and patted the lead container.\n\"Too bad this isn't a baby bomb,\" he muttered. \"We could be sure Barnard\nwouldn't finish.\"\n\n\"He's finished right now, but he doesn't know it.\" Brett smiled. \"He's\nborrowed heavily just on this race, and when he loses, the banks will\nclose him up. Kit Barnard is through.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5\n\n\n\"We regret to announce that the spaceship _La Belle France_, piloted by\nGigi Duarte, has crashed!\"\n\nCaptain Strong's voice was choked with emotion as he made the\nannouncement over the spaceport public-address system. There was an\naudible groan of sympathy from the thousands of spectators in the\ngrandstands. In spite of every precaution for safety, death had visited\nthe spaceways.\n\nStrong continued, \"We have just received official confirmation from Luna\nCity that the Paris-Venusport Transfer Company entry exploded in space\nsoon after leaving Luna City. Captain Duarte had flown the first leg of\nthe race from Earth to the Moon in record time.\"\n\nThe Solar Guard officer snapped off the microphone and turned to Tom,\nRoger, and Astro. \"It's hard to believe that the French Chicken won't be\nshuttling from Paris to Venusport any more,\" he murmured.\n\n\"Are there any details, sir?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"You know there are never any details, Corbett,\" said Strong with a\nlittle edge in his voice. Then he immediately apologized. \"I'm sorry,\nTom. Gigi was an old friend.\"\n\nThe door behind them opened and an enlisted spaceman stepped inside,\nsaluting smartly. \"Ready for the next blast-off, Captain Strong,\" he\nannounced.\n\n\"Who is it?\" asked Strong, turning to the intercom connecting him with\nthe control tower that co-ordinated all the landings and departures at\nthe spaceport.\n\nThe spaceman referred to a clipboard. \"It's the _Space Lance_, sir.\nPiloted by Captain Sticoon. He's representing an independent company\nfrom Marsopolis.\"\n\n\"Right, thanks.\" Strong turned to the intercom mike, calling, \"Captain\nStrong to control tower, check in.\"\n\n\"Say, I'd like to see this fellow blast,\" said Tom. \"He's supposed to be\none of the hottest pilots ever to hit space.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" agreed Roger. \"He's so good I don't see how anyone else could\nhave a chance.\"\n\n\"With that hot rocket in this race,\" said Astro, \"the others will have\nto fight for second and third place.\"\n\n\"Control tower to Strong,\" a voice crackled over the intercom\nloud-speaker. \"Ready here, sir.\"\n\n\"Right. Stand by for the next flight, Mac,\" replied Strong. \"It's\nSticoon.\"\n\nStrong flipped a switch on the intercom to direct contact with the\nwaiting ship and gave Sticoon the oft-repeated final briefing,\nconcluding, \"Do not go beyond the necessary limitations of fuel\nconsumption that are provided for in the Solar Guard space code. If you\nreturn here with less than a quarter supply of reactant fuel, you will\nbe disqualified. Stand by to blast off!\"\n\n\"Uh-huh!\" was all the acknowledgment Strong received from the Martian.\nFamed for his daring, Sticoon was also known for his taciturn\npersonality.\n\n\"Clear ramp! Clear ramp!\" Strong boomed over the public-address system.\nWhen he received the all-clear from the enlisted spaceman on the ramp,\nStrong flipped both the public-address system and the intercom on.\n\"Stand by to raise ship!\"\n\nHe glanced at the astral chronometer. \"Blast off, minus five, four,\nthree, two, one--_zero!_\"\n\nTom, Roger, and Astro crowded to the viewport in Strong's command shack\nto watch the bulky Martian's ship take to space. With Sticoon at the\ncontrols, there was no hesitation. He gave the ship full throttle from\nthe moment of blast-off and in three seconds was out of sight. There\nwasn't much to see at such speed.\n\nThe three members of the _Polaris_ unit left the shack to return to\ntheir task of inspection. They passed the maintenance hangar where Kit\nBarnard was readying his ship for blast-off in the next half hour.\n\n\"Any last-minute hitches, Kit?\" asked Astro, vitally interested in the\nnew reactor unit and its cooling system.\n\nKit smiled wearily and shook his head. \"All set!\"\n\n\"Good.\" Tom smiled. \"We'll try to be back before you blast. We've got to\ncheck Quent Miles' ship now.\"\n\nAs the three cadets approached the sleek black vessel with its\ndistinctive markings, the air lock opened and Quent Miles stepped out on\nthe ladder.\n\n\"It's about time you three jerks showed up,\" he sneered. \"I have to\nblast off in twenty minutes! What's the idea of messing around with that\nBarnard creep? He hasn't got a chance, anyway.\"\n\n\"Is that so?\" snapped Roger. \"Listen--!\"\n\n\"_Roger!_\" barked Tom warningly.\n\nQuent grinned. \"That's right. Lay off, buster. Get to your inspecting\nand let a spaceman blast off.\"\n\n\"Kit Barnard will blast off after you, and still beat you back,\" growled\nRoger, stepping into the ship. He stopped suddenly and gasped in\namazement. \"Well, blast my jets!\"\n\nTom and Astro crowded into the air lock and looked around, openmouthed.\nBefore them was what appeared to be a hollow shell of a ship. There were\nno decks or bulkheads, nothing but an intricate network of ladders\nconnecting the various operating positions of the spaceship. Everything\nthat could be removed had been taken out of the ship.\n\n\"Is this legal?\" asked Roger incredulously.\n\n\"I'm afraid it is, Roger,\" said Tom. \"But we're going to make sure that\neverything that's supposed to be in a spaceship is in this one.\"\n\n\"When I blast off, I don't intend carrying any passengers,\" growled\nMiles behind them. \"If you're going to inspect, then inspect and stop\ngabbing.\"\n\n\"Let's go,\" said Tom grimly.\n\nThe three boys split up and began crawling around in the network of\nexposed supporting beams and struts that took the place of decks and\nbulkheads. It did not take them long to determine that Quent Miles' ship\nwas in perfect condition for blast-off. With but a few minutes to spare,\nthey returned to face Miles at the air lock.\n\n\"O.K., you're cleared,\" Tom announced.\n\n\"But it'll take more than a light ship to win this race,\" said Roger,\nand unable to restrain himself, he added, \"You're bucking the best space\nbusters in the universe!\"\n\n\"One of them\"--Quent held up his finger--\"is dead.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" growled Astro, \"but there are plenty more just as good as Gigi\nDuarte.\"\n\nThe intercom buzzer sounded in the ship and Quent snapped, \"Beat it!\nI've got a race to win.\" He pushed the three cadets out of the air lock\nand slammed the pluglike door closed. From two feet away it was\nimpossible to spot the seams in the metal covering on the port and the\nhull.\n\n\"Clear ramp! Clear ramp!\" Strong's voice echoed over the spaceport. Tom,\nRoger, and Astro scurried down the ladder and broke away from the ramp\nin a run. They knew Quent Miles would not hesitate to blast off whether\nanyone was within range of his exhaust or not.\n\n\"Blast off, minus five, four, three, two, one--_zero!_\"\n\nAgain the spaceport reverberated to the sound of a ship blasting off.\nAll eyes watched the weirdly painted black ship shudder under the surge\nof power, and then shoot spaceward as if out of a cannon.\n\n\"Well, ring me around Saturn,\" breathed Tom, looking up into the sky\nwhere the black ship had disappeared from view. \"Whatever Quent Miles\nis, he can sure take acceleration.\"\n\n\"Spaceman,\" said Astro, taking a deep breath, \"you can say that again.\nWow!\"\n\n\"I hope it broke his blasted neck,\" said Roger.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"And you saw him messing around here, Sid?\" asked Kit Barnard of his\nyoung helper.\n\n\"That's right,\" replied the crew chief. \"I was on the control deck\nchecking out the panel and I happened to look down. I couldn't see too\nwell, but it was a big guy.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Messing around the reactor, huh?\" mused Kit, almost asking the question\nof himself.\n\n\"That's right. I checked it right away, but I couldn't find anything\nwrong.\"\n\n\"Well, it's too late now, anyway. I blast in three minutes.\" Grimly Kit\nBarnard looked up at the sky where the black ship had just vanished.\n\n\"Spaceman's luck, Kit,\" said Sid, offering his hand. Kit grasped it\nquickly and jumped into his ship, closing the air lock behind him.\n\nAs Sid climbed down from the ramp, the three cadets rushed up\nbreathlessly, disappointed at being unable to give Kit their personal\ngood wishes.\n\n\"Well, anyway, I gave the new reactor my blessing last night,\" said\nAstro as they walked away from the ramp.\n\n\"You were aboard the ship last night?\" Sid exclaimed.\n\n\"Uh-huh,\" replied Astro. \"Hope you don't mind.\"\n\n\"No, not a bit!\" Sid broke into a smile. \"Whew! I thought for a while it\nwas Quent.\"\n\n\"What about Quent?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"I saw someone messing around on the power deck last night and thought\nit might be Quent. But now that you say it was you, Astro, there isn't\nanything to worry about.\"\n\nReaching a safe distance from the ramp, they stopped just as Strong\nfinished counting off the seconds to blast off.\n\n\"_Zero!_\"\n\nThe three cadets and Sid waited for the initial shattering roar of the\njets, but it did not come. Instead, there was a loud bang, followed by\nanother, and then another. And only then did the ship begin to leave the\nground, gradually picking up speed and shooting spaceward.\n\n\"What was wrong?\" asked Tom, looking at Sid.\n\n\"The feeders,\" replied the young engineer miserably. \"They're not\nfunctioning properly. They're probably jamming.\"\n\nAstro looked puzzled. \"But I checked those feeders myself, just before\nyou closed the casing,\" he said. \"They were all right then.\"\n\n\"Are you sure?\" asked Sid.\n\n\"Of course I'm sure,\" said Astro. \"Checking the feeders is one of my\nmain jobs.\"\n\n\"Then it must be the reactant,\" said Tom. \"Did Kit use standard\nreactant?\"\n\nSid nodded. \"Got it right here at the spaceport. Same stuff everyone\nelse is using.\"\n\nGloomily the four young spacemen turned away from the ramp and headed\nfor the control tower to hear the latest reports from the ships already\nunderway. There were only a few more ships scheduled to blast off, and\nthe cadets had already inspected them.\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" said Tom, stopping suddenly. \"The fuel tanks are on the\nportside of the ship, and the feeders are on the starboard. Where did\nyou see this fellow messing around, Sid?\"\n\nSid thought a moment and then his face clouded. \"Come to think of it, I\nsaw him on the portside.\"\n\n\"I wasn't even close to the tanks!\" exclaimed Astro.\n\n\"There was someone messing around them, then,\" said Roger.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Tom grimly. \"But we don't know _who_--or _what_ he did.\"\n\n\"From the sound of those rockets,\" said Astro, \"Kit's feeders are\nclogged, or there's something in his reactant that the strainers are not\nfiltering out.\"\n\n\"Well,\" sighed Roger, \"there isn't anything Kit can do but keep going\nand hope that everything turns out for the best.\"\n\n\"_If_ he can keep going!\" said Tom. \"You know, there are some things\nabout this whole race that really puzzle me.\"\n\n\"What?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"Impure reactant in Kit's ship, after fellows like Kit, Astro, and Sid\nchecked it a hundred times. Gigi Duarte crashing after making record\nspeed to the Moon. The minimum specifications being stolen from\nCommander Walters....\" Tom stopped and looked at his friends. \"That\nenough?\"\n\nRoger, Astro, and Sid considered the young cadet's words. The picture\nTom presented had many curious sides and no one had the slightest idea\nof how to go beyond speculation and find proof!\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6\n\n\n\"The winners are--\" Captain Strong's voice rang loud and clear over the\nloud-speakers--\"first place, Captain Sticoon, piloting the Marsopolis\nLimited entry, _Space Lance_! Second place, Captain Miles, piloting the\nCharles Brett Company entry, _Space Knight_! Third place, Captain\nBarnard, piloting his own ship, _Good Company_!\"\n\nThere was a tremendous roar from the crowd. In front of the official\nstand, Tom, Roger, and Astro pounded Sid Goldberg on the back until he\nbegged for mercy. On the stand, Strong and Kit shook hands and grinned\nat each other. And Commander Walters stepped up to congratulate the\nthree winners. Walters handed each of them a personal message of good\nwishes from the Solar Council, and then, over the public-address system,\nmade a short speech to the pilots of the losing ships thanking them for\ntheir co-operation and good sportsmanship. He paused, and in a voice\nhushed with emotion, offered a short prayer in memory of Gigi Duarte.\nThe entire spaceport was quiet for two minutes without prompting,\nvoluntarily paying homage to the brave spaceman.\n\nAfter Walters left and the ceremonies were over, the three winners stood\nlooking at each other, sizing up one another. Each of them knew that the\nwinner of this race probably would go down in the history of deep space.\nThere was fame and fortune to be won now. Quent Miles ignored Sticoon\nand swaggered over to Kit Barnard.\n\n\"You were lucky, Barnard,\" he sneered. \"Too bad it won't last for the\nrace.\"\n\n\"We'll see, Quent,\" said Kit coolly.\n\nSticoon said nothing, just watched them quietly. Quent Miles laughed and\nwalked off the stand. Kit Barnard looked at Sticoon. \"What's the matter\nwith him?\" he asked.\n\nThe Martian shrugged. \"Got a hot rocket in his craw,\" he said quietly.\n\"But watch your step with him, Kit. Personally, I wouldn't trust that\nspaceman as far as I could throw an asteroid.\"\n\nKit grinned. \"Thanks--and good luck.\"\n\n\"I'll need it if you get that reactor of yours working,\" said the\nMartian.\n\nHe turned and left the stand without a word to Tom, Roger, or Astro. The\nthree cadets looked at each other, feeling the tension in the air\nsuddenly relax. Strong was busy talking to someone on the portable\nintercom and had missed the byplay between the three finalists.\n\n\"That Quent sure has a talent for making himself disliked,\" Tom\ncommented to his unit mates.\n\n\"And all he's going to get for it is trouble,\" quipped Sid, who would\nnot let any argument take away the pleasure he felt over winning the\ntrials. \"I'm going back to our ship and find out what happened to those\nfeeders.\"\n\n\"I'll come with you,\" volunteered Astro.\n\n\"Just a minute, Astro,\" interrupted Strong. \"I've been talking with\nCommander Walters. He's on his way back to the Tower of Galileo and\ncalled me from the portable communicator on the main slidewalk. He wants\nme to report to his office on the double. You three will have to take\ncare of the final details here.\"\n\n\"Come down when you can,\" said Sid to Astro, and turned to leave with\nKit.\n\n\"Something wrong, sir?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"I don't know, Tom,\" replied Strong, a worried frown on his face.\n\"Commander Walters seemed excited.\"\n\n\"Does it have anything to do with the race?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"In a way it does,\" replied Strong. \"I'm leaving on special assignment.\nI'm not sure, but I think you three will have to monitor the race by\nyourselves.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMajor Connel sat to one side of Commander Walters' desk, a scowl on his\nheavy, fleshy face. The commander paced back and forth in front of the\ndesk, and Captain Strong stood at the office window staring blankly down\non the dark quadrangle below. The door opened and the three officers\nturned quickly to see Dr. Joan Dale enter, carrying several papers in\nher hand.\n\n\"Well, Joan?\" asked Walters.\n\n\"I'm afraid that the reports are true, sir,\" Dr. Dale said. \"There are\npositive signs of decreasing pressure in the artificial atmosphere\naround the settlements on Titan. The pressure is dropping and yet there\nis no indication that the force screen, holding back the real methane\nammonia atmosphere of Titan, is not functioning properly.\"\n\n\"How about leaks?\" Connel growled.\n\n\"Not possible, Major,\" replied the pretty physicist. \"The force field,\nas you know, is made up of electronic impulses of pure energy. By\nshooting these impulses into the air around a certain area, like the\nsettlement at Olympia, we can refract the methane ammonia, push it back\nif you will, like a solid wall. What the impulses do, actually, is\ncreate a force greater and thicker in content than the atmosphere of\nTitan, creating a vacuum. We then introduce oxygen into the vacuum,\nmaking it possible for humans to live without the cumbersome use of\nspace helmets.\" Dr. Dale leaned against Commander Walters' desk and\nconsidered the three Solar Guard officers. \"If we don't find out what's\nhappening out there,\" she resumed grimly, \"and do something about it\nsoon, we'll have to abandon Titan.\"\n\n\"Abandon Titan!\" roared Connel. \"Can't be done.\"\n\n\"Impossible!\" snapped Walters.\n\n\"It's going to happen,\" asserted the girl stoutly.\n\nConnel sprang out of his chair and began pacing the floor. \"We can't\nabandon Titan!\" he roared. \"Disrupt the flow of crystal and you'll set\noff major repercussions in the system's economy.\"\n\n\"We know that, Major,\" said Walters. \"That's the prime reason for this\nmeeting.\"\n\n\"May I make a suggestion, sir?\" asked Strong.\n\n\"Go ahead, Steve,\" said Walters.\n\n\"While these graphs of Joan's show us _what's_ happening, I think it\nwill take on-the-spot investigations to find out _why_ it's happening.\"\n\nConnel flopped back in his chair, relaxed again. He looked at Walters.\n\"Send Steve out there and we'll find out what's going on,\" he said\nconfidently.\n\nWalters looked at Strong. \"When are the ships supposed to blast off for\nthe race?\"\n\n\"Tomorrow at 1800, sir.\"\n\n\"You planned to use the _Polaris_ to monitor the race?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Think we should send the _Polaris_ unit out alone?\"\n\n\"I have a better suggestion, sir,\" said Strong.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Since there are only three finalists, how about putting one cadet on\neach ship? Then I can take the _Polaris_ and go on out to Titan now.\nWhen the boys arrive, they could help me with my investigation.\"\n\nWalters looked at Connel. \"What do you think, Major?\"\n\n\"Sounds all right to me,\" replied the veteran spaceman. \"If you think\nthe companies won't object to having cadets monitor their race for\nthem.\"\n\n\"They won't have anything to say about it,\" replied Walters. \"I'd trust\nthose cadets under any circumstances. And the race won't mean a thing\nunless we can find the source of trouble on Titan. There won't be any\ncrystal to haul.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" grunted Connel. He rose, nodded, and left the room. He was not\nbeing curt, he was being Connel. The problem had been temporarily solved\nand there was nothing else he could do. There were other things that\ndemanded his attention.\n\n\"What about me going along too, Commander?\" asked Joan.\n\n\"Better not, Joan,\" said Walters. \"You're more valuable to us here in\nthe Academy laboratory.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir,\" she said. \"I have some work to finish, so I'll leave\nyou now. Good luck, Steve.\" She shook hands with the young captain and\nleft.\n\nWalters turned back to Strong. \"Well, now that's settled, tell me, what\ndo you think of the race tomorrow, Steve?\"\n\n\"If Kit Barnard gets that reactor of his functioning properly, he'll run\naway from the other two.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" mused Walters. \"Wild Bill Sticoon is a hot spaceman. One\nof the best rocket jockeys I've ever seen. Did I ever tell you what we\nwent through a few years back trying to get him to join the Solar\nGuard?\" Walters laughed. \"We promised him everything but the Moon. But\nhe didn't want any part of us. 'Can't ride fast enough in your wagons,\nCommander,' he told me. Quite a boy!\"\n\n\"And with Quent Miles in there, it's going to be a very hot race,\"\nasserted Strong.\n\n\"Ummmmh,\" Walters grunted. \"He's the unknown quantity. Did you see that\nship of his? Never saw anything more streamlined in my whole life.\"\n\n\"And the cadets said he stripped her of everything but the hull plates.\"\n\n\"It paid off for him,\" said Walters. \"He and Charley Brett are certainly\nworking hard to get this contract.\"\n\n\"There's a lot of money involved, sir,\" said Strong. \"But in any case\nwe're bound to get a good schedule with the speeds established so far.\"\n\n\"Well, advise the cadets to stand by for blast-off with the finalists\ntomorrow.\"\n\n\"Any particular ship you want them each assigned to, sir?\" asked Strong.\n\n\"No, let them decide,\" replied Walters. \"But it would be best if you\ncould keep Manning away from Miles. That's like putting a rocket into a\nfire and asking it not to explode.\"\n\nThe two men grinned at each other and then settled down to working out\nthe details of Strong's trip. Before the evening was over, Walters had\ndecided, if necessary, he would follow Strong out to Titan.\n\nIn the distance, they could hear the muffled roar of rocket motors as\nthe three finalists tuned up their ships, preparing for the greatest\nspace race in history. And it seemed to Strong that with each blast\nthere was a vaguely ominous echo.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I've strained that fuel four times and come up with the same answer,\"\nsaid Astro. The giant Venusian held up the oil-smeared test tube for Kit\nBarnard's inspection. \"Impure reactant. And so impure that it couldn't\npossibly have come from the Academy supply depot. It would have been\nnoticed.\"\n\n\"Then how did it get in my feeders?\" asked Kit, half to himself.\n\n\"Whoever was messing around on the power deck just before you blasted\noff for the trials must have dumped it in,\" said Tom.\n\n\"Obviously.\" Kit nodded. \"But who is that? Who would want to do a dirty\nthing like that?\"\n\n\"Who indeed?\" said a voice in back of them. They all spun around to\nface Quent Miles. He lounged against the stabilizer fin and grinned at\nthem.\n\n\"What do you want, Miles?\" asked Kit.\n\n\"Just stopped by to give you the proverbial handshake of good luck\nbefore we blast off,\" replied the spaceman with a mocking wink.\n\n\"Kit doesn't need your good wishes,\" snapped Sid.\n\n\"Well, now, that's too bad,\" said Quent. \"I have a feeling that he's\ngoing to need a lot more than luck.\"\n\n\"Listen, Miles,\" snapped Kit, \"did you come aboard my ship and tamper\nwith the fuel?\"\n\nQuent's eyes clouded. \"Careful of your accusations, Barnard.\"\n\n\"I'm not accusing you, I'm asking you.\"\n\n\"See you in space.\" Quent laughed, turning to leave, not answering the\nquestion. \"But then, again, maybe I won't see you.\" He disappeared into\nthe darkness of the night.\n\n\"The nerve of that guy,\" growled Tom.\n\n\"Yes,\" Kit agreed, shrugging his shoulders. \"But I'm more concerned\nabout this unit than I am about Quent Miles and his threats. Let's get\nback to work.\"\n\nRenewing their efforts, Tom, Roger, Astro, Sid, and Kit Barnard turned\nto the reactor unit and began the laborious job of putting it back\ntogether again, at the same time replacing worn-out parts and adjusting\nthe delicate clearances.\n\nIt was just before dawn when Strong visited Kit's ship. Seeing the\ncadets stripped to the waist and working with the veteran spaceman, he\nroared his disapproval. \"Of all the crazy things to do! Don't you know\nthat you could have Kit disqualified for helping him?\"\n\n[Illustration: _The giant Venusian held up the oil-smeared test tube_]\n\n\"But--but--\" Tom tried to stammer an explanation.\n\n\"I couldn't have done it alone,\" explained Kit. He looked at Strong and\ntheir eyes met. Understanding flowed between them.\n\n\"Very well,\" said Strong, fighting to control himself. \"If no one makes\na complaint against you, we'll let it pass.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Steve,\" said Kit.\n\n\"You should have known better, Kit,\" said Strong. \"The Solar Guard is\nsupposed to be neutral throughout the entire race and do nothing but\njudge it.\"\n\n\"I know, Steve,\" said Kit. \"But someone dumped impure reactant into\nmy--\"\n\n\"What?\" It was the first time Strong had heard of it and he listened\nintently as the cadets and Sid told him the whole story.\n\n\"Why didn't you make a complaint?\" demanded Strong finally. \"We'd have\ngiven you more time to get squared away.\"\n\n\"It's not important,\" said Kit. \"I won a place in the finals and now the\nboys and Sid have helped me clean it out.\"\n\nStrong nodded. \"All right. I guess one seems to balance out the other.\nForget it.\" He smiled. \"And excuse me for jumping like that and thinking\nthat you would do anything--er--\" He hesitated.\n\n\"That's all right, Steve.\" Kit spoke up quickly to save his friend\nembarrassment.\n\nStrong turned to the cadets. \"I've got news for you three. You are going\nto monitor the race by yourselves.\"\n\nTom, Roger, and Astro looked at each other dumfounded as Strong quickly\noutlined the plan. Later, when Sid and Kit were working inside the\nship, he told them of the sudden danger on Titan.\n\n\"So I'm going to leave it up to you which ship you want to ride,\" he\nconcluded. \"The commander has suggested that Roger not be sent along\nwith Miles on the _Space Knight_. He seems to think the two of you\nwouldn't get along.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, skipper,\" said Roger, \"I'd like the opportunity of\nkeeping an eye on him.\"\n\nStrong thought a moment. \"Not a bad idea, Roger,\" he said as he turned\nto Astro. \"And I suppose you want to ride with Kit and his reactor?\"\n\nAstro grinned. \"Yes, sir. If I may.\"\n\n\"All right. Tom, I guess that means you ride with Wild Bill Sticoon.\"\n\n\"That's all right with me, sir,\" the young cadet said excitedly. \"This\nis something I'll be able to tell my grandchildren--riding with the\nhottest spaceman in the hottest race through space.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nQuent Miles spun around, his paralo-ray gun leveled. He saw a figure\nenter through the hatch, but when light revealed the face he relaxed.\n\n\"Oh, it's you!\" he grumbled. \"I thought you were setting things up back\nat Atom City.\"\n\n\"You fumble-fisted, space-gassing jerk!\" snarled Charley Brett. \"Depend\non you to get things messed up! That Barnard guy is all set to roll with\nhis reactor!\"\n\n\"Then why didn't Ross take care of him on the Moon?\" asked Miles.\n\n\"He didn't land,\" replied Brett. \"He kept going and made the whole trip\nwithout refueling that new unit of his. It's so good that he got back\nhere still carrying half a tank of reactant.\"\n\n\"Well, you haven't any kick with me,\" asserted Miles. \"I dumped that\nstuff in his tanks.\"\n\n\"Then how come he made it so fast?\" growled Brett. \"How come he made it\nat all?\"\n\n\"How should I know?\" snapped Quent. \"Listen, Charley, lay off me. You\nmight be able to order Ross around, but you don't scare me. And I don't\nthink you have Ross fooled either.\"\n\n\"Never mind that now!\" said Brett irritably. \"We've got to line things\nup for the race. Listen! Ross left Luna City this morning for the\nhide-out. Here's what I want you to do. After you blast off--\" Brett's\nvoice dropped to a whisper and Quent's eyes opened with understanding,\nand then his rugged features broke out into a grin as Brett continued\ntalking.\n\nFinally Brett straightened up. \"I'm going on out to Titan now to see if\nthings are O.K. You got everything clear?\"\n\n\"Everything's clear,\" said Quent. \"And you know something, Charley? You\nhave a nasty way about you, but you certainly know how to figure the\nangles. This is perfect. We can't miss.\"\n\n\"I love you too, sweetheart,\" said Brett sourly. He turned and hurried\nout of the ship. Just before he stepped on the slidewalk that would take\nhim to the monorail station, he saw the three members of the _Polaris_\nunit leaving Kit Barnard's installation. He grinned and made a mocking\nsalute to them in the darkness.\n\n\"So long suckers!\" he called softly.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7\n\n\n\"What!\"\n\nQuent Miles looked at Strong and then back at Roger. \"You mean this\njerk's going to ride with me?\"\n\nRoger Manning squared his shoulders and stuck out his chin. \"Let's make\nthe most of this, Miles,\" he said. \"I don't like it any more than you\ndo. I wouldn't like to be watched, either, if I had just crawled out\nfrom under a rock.\"\n\nStrong suppressed a grin and then turned back to Quent. \"That's the way\nit is, Miles. Commander Walters' orders. There's nothing that can be\ndone now. Cadets Manning, Corbett, and Astro have been given these\nassignments because they have worked so closely on the race project,\nand, I might add, you couldn't ask for a better astrogator should you\nget into trouble.\"\n\n\"The day I'll ask for help from a kid still wet behind the ears is the\nday I'll stop flying,\" snarled Miles.\n\nStrong shrugged. \"You either consent to the regulations, or disqualify\nyourself from the race.\"\n\nThe spaceman's face turned a dusky red under his swarthy complexion.\n\"All right, all right! If that's the way it is, that's the way we'll\nplay it. But I'm warning you, Manning, stay away from me.\"\n\nStrong glanced at his wrist chronograph. \"You have five minutes before\nthe blast-off, stand by.\" He shook hands with Roger. \"Good luck, Roger,\nand be careful. And remember, Captain Miles has already proved himself a\ncrackerjack spaceman. Don't interfere with him.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Roger.\n\n\"Good luck, Miles,\" said Strong and offered his hand. Quent ignored it.\n\n\"Thanks for nothing,\" he sneered. \"I know how much you want me to have.\"\n\n\"The best man wins,\" snapped Strong. He turned on his heels and left the\nblack ship.\n\nQuent Miles and Roger faced each other. \"All right, Manning,\" said Miles\nafter he had closed the air lock, \"take your station. And remember I'm\nskipper of this ship.\"\n\n\"So what?\" said Roger. \"I'm still the monitor--!\" He turned and\nswaggered away.\n\nMiles watched him go, a crooked smile twisting his lips. \"Make the most\nof it, Manning,\" he muttered under his breath.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You will make two stops for refueling on your trip,\" Captain Strong\ncalled over the loud-speakers, as well as into the intercom connecting\nthe three ships. \"First fuel stop will be on Deimos of Mars and the\nsecond will be at Ganymede. You are to chart a direct course to each of\nthem. Should an emergency arise, you will call for assistance on the\nspecial teleceiver and audioceiver circuits open to you, numbers\nseventeen and eighty-three. You are to circle each fueling stop three\ntimes before making a touchdown, and make a final circle around Titan\nwhen you arrive.\n\n\"Stand by to raise ship! And spaceman's luck!\"\n\nStrong turned and flipped on the intercom to the control tower. \"All\nready up there?\" he called.\n\n\"All set, sir,\" replied the enlisted spaceman.\n\n\"All right, give them their orbits and blast-off time.\"\n\nThere was a slight pause, and then the gruff voice of the tower operator\nwas heard over the loud-speakers and in the ships. \"All ships will blast\noff on orbit forty-one ... raise ship at 18:51:35 ... stand by!\"\n\nThere was a tense moment of silence while the seconds on the red hand of\nthe astral chronometer slipped around the dial. Out on the field, the\nthree ships were pointed toward the darkening afternoon skies. The first\nship, nearest the tower, was Wild Bill Sticoon's ship, the _Space\nLance_, painted a gleaming white. Strong could see Tom sitting beside\nthe viewport, and across the distance that separated them, the Solar\nGuard officer could see the curly-haired cadet wave. He returned the\ngreeting.\n\nNext was the black ship with the red markings that had aroused so much\ncomment. Strong searched the viewports for a sight of Roger but could\nnot see him. Finally he looked over at Kit Barnard's red-painted _Good\nCompany_. He knew Astro would be on the power deck, preferring to nurse\nthe reactor than watch the blast-off.\n\nAnd then Strong was conscious of the tower operator counting off the\nseconds. He would pick it up at ten minus. He gripped the intercom mike\nas Mike's voice droned in his ears.\n\n\" ... fifteen, fourteen, thirteen, twelve, eleven, ten....\"\n\n\"Stand by to raise ships!\" bawled Strong. He watched the sweep hand on\nthe chronometer. \"Blast off, minus five, four, three, two, one--_zero!_\"\n\nThere was really very little to see. The three ships left Earth in a\ngiant upheaval of thunderous noise and blazing red exhaust flames. The\nroar of the crowds was lost in the explosions of the rockets. And the\ngreatest race in space was underway.\n\nStrong raced up to the control tower and stood in front of the radar\nscanner to watch the course of the three vessels now blasting through\nthe atmosphere. They were three white blips on the green surface of the\nglass scope, in perfect line, traveling at incredible speeds.\n\nStrong turned to the enlisted spaceman. \"Contact the ships and see if\neverything's all right,\" he ordered.\n\n\"Very well, sir,\" replied the spaceman, turning to the audioceiver\nmicrophone.\n\n\"Spaceport control to rocket ships _Space Lance_, _Space Knight_, and\n_Good Company_. Come in, please.\"\n\nThere was a crackling of static over the loud-speaker and then the calm\nvoice of Tom filled the control tower. \"This is Corbett on the _Space\nLance_. Go ahead.\"\n\nStrong took the microphone. \"This is Captain Strong,\" he called. \"How\nwas your blast-off, Tom?\"\n\n\"Smooth as silk, sir,\" replied the young cadet. \"Wild Bill sends his\ngreetings and says he'll take a three-inch steak instead of flowers when\nhe wins.\"\n\n\"Tell him it's a deal.\" Strong laughed. \"End transmission.\"\n\n\"See you on Titan, sir,\" said Tom. \"End transmission.\"\n\nStrong then spoke to Kit Barnard on the _Good Company_, but did not get\na chance to speak to Astro. \"He's down on the power deck, Steve,\"\nreported Kit. \"He's watching that reactor as if it were a treasure\nchest.\"\n\n\"To him it _is_,\" said Strong. \"Good luck, Kit.\"\n\n\"Incidentally,\" said Kit before signing off, \"I heard that crack Wild\nBill made about a steak. Better put _my_ name on it!\"\n\nStrong then contacted Quent Miles' vessel. \"Is Manning there, Miles?\"\n\n\"Yeah, he's here. Dead asleep!\" growled Miles. \"I thought you said he\nwas going to be a help.\"\n\nStrong's face grew red. \"Well, wake him up,\" he snapped.\n\n\"You come wake him up,\" said Miles, and then the speaker went dead.\n\n\"Control tower to _Space Knight_!\" Strong called angrily. \"Come in,\nMiles. Control tower to _Space Knight_!\"\n\n\"Yeah. What do you want?\" growled Miles over the vast distance of space\nthat already separated the two men and that each second took them\nthousands of miles farther apart.\n\n\"I want to speak to Manning,\" demanded Strong. \"And if you cut me off\nlike that again, Miles, I'll have you before a Solar Guard court for\nviolation of the space code, race or no race.\"\n\n\"I told you once,\" said Miles. \"Manning is asleep. He sacked in right\nafter we left the Academy. Now leave me alone, will you! I've got a race\nto win!\"\n\n\"Very well, Miles,\" said Strong. \"But for your sake, I hope Cadet\nManning _is_ asleep.\"\n\n\"End transmission,\" growled Miles, and again the speaker went dead.\n\n\"Trouble, Steve?\"\n\nStrong turned to see Commander Walters enter the control room.\n\n\"No, sir,\" said Strong. \"I tried to contact Roger, but Quent Miles told\nme he's asleep.\"\n\n\"Asleep!\" cried Walters. \"But I thought you weren't going to put Manning\nwith Miles.\"\n\n\"Astro wanted to go with Kit, sir. And Tom was anxious to go with Wild\nBill Sticoon. Roger didn't seem to mind.\"\n\n\"Did Miles object?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. But I think he would object to anyone going with him.\"\n\n\"And he told you Roger is asleep?\"\n\nStrong nodded. Walters pushed past him to the intercom and took the\nmicrophone. \"This is Commander Walters calling rocket ship _Space\nKnight_. Come in, _Space Knight_.\"\n\nThere was a flutter of static and then Quent Miles' voice again. There\nwas a little more respect in his tone but his story was the same. Roger\nwas sleeping.\n\nWalters slammed the microphone down. \"By the craters of Luna, this is\nthe last time I'll take this nonsense from Manning!\" He jerked around\nand stood facing the viewport. \"I'm sorry, Steve, but there have been\nmore reports from Titan. The situation is serious. I've had to start\nevacuation. And then to get this smart-alecky behavior out of Manning.\nWell, you know what I mean.\"\n\nStrong nodded, now more concerned about the emergency on Mars. \"Shall I\nblast off right away, sir?\" he asked.\n\nWalters nodded grimly. \"Yes. And I'm going with you. I'll leave Major\nConnel in charge while I'm gone. I would prefer to have him go, but he's\nbeen working with Dr. Dale on some new idea about reinforcing the force\nfield and I can't pull him off it. You and I will have to do what we\ncan.\"\n\nStrong turned to the tower operator and ordered the rocket cruiser\n_Polaris_ readied for immediate space flight, concluding, \" ... and have\na full complement of Space Marines aboard. And I want Warrant Officer\nMike McKenny as squad leader.\"\n\n\"Have you forgotten, sir?\" interjected the enlisted spaceman who was\ntaking Strong's orders. \"Warrant Officer McKenny cannot take\nacceleration.\"\n\n\"All right, get--\" Strong hesitated. \"Get me Jeff Marshall, Professor\nSykes' assistant.\"\n\nWalters nodded. \"Good idea. Jeff can take care of any lab tests we may\nhave to make and also knows how to handle men. As a matter of fact,\"\nWalters continued, \"if Jeff does well on this assignment I might put him\nup for a commission in the Solar Guard. He did well on that last trip\ninto deep space during that trouble on Roald.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Strong. \"And I'll gladly endorse it.\"\n\n\"Is that all, sir?\" asked the enlisted man.\n\n\"That's it, spaceman!\" said Strong. When the man didn't move right\naway, Walters and Strong looked at him. \"Well, what is it?\"\n\n\"Excuse me, sir,\" said the guardsman, a bright-faced youngster who had\nfailed to pass the rigid requirements for cadet training and so had\nentered the enlisted Solar Guard. \"I heard what Captain Miles said about\nCadet Manning being asleep and--\" He hesitated.\n\n\"Well, what about it?\" prompted Walters.\n\n\"Well, sir, I don't know if it means anything or not,\" replied the boy\nnervously. \"But just before the ship blasted off, I saw Cadet Manning\nstanding inside the air lock. He looked as if he wanted to get out. But\nyou were counting the blast-off time, sir. And he disappeared a few\nseconds before you hit zero.\"\n\nStrong looked at Walters. \"Are you sure?\" he asked the boy.\n\n\"I'm positive, sir. I know Cadet Manning well, and he looked as though\nhe was scared.\"\n\nStrong clenched his fists. \"Asleep, huh?\" he growled. \"Get me the _Space\nKnight_!\"\n\nThe boy returned to the audioceiver and began calling Miles, but there\nwas no reply. After a few minutes Walters interrupted, \"We can't waste\nany more time here, Steve. We've got to blast off!\"\n\n\"Get hold of Corbett on the _Space Lance_,\" said Strong to the spaceman.\n\"Tell him I said to get in touch with Manning on the _Space Knight_. Ask\nhim to find out what's going on.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"And then tell him to contact me on the _Polaris_. We're blasting off\nimmediately.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir.\"\n\nWalters turned to Captain Strong. \"What do you think it means, Steve?\"\nhe asked.\n\n\"I can't figure it, sir. Knowing Manning as I do, it could be a crazy\nstunt or it could be serious.\"\n\n\"It had better be serious,\" said Walters grimly, \"for Manning's sake.\nOne more slip, and I'm bouncing him right out of the Academy!\"\n\nThe two officers left the control tower, leaving young Oliver Muffin\nalone, droning his monotonous call to Tom Corbett, somewhere between\nEarth and Mars--a call that was to be the young cadet's first warning of\ntreachery in deep space!\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 8\n\n\n\"All clear ahead, Bill!\"\n\nTom Corbett stood at the radarscope and watched the thin white line\nsweep around the face of the instrument. \"Nothing in space but us!\" he\nannounced.\n\nThe veteran spaceman grunted and grinned at the curly-haired cadet he\nhad grown to like and respect in the short time they had been together.\nNot only did Tom know how to handle a ship, spelling the pilot for a few\nmoments to have a walk around the control deck, but he was good company\nas well. More than once, Tom had surprised the Martian spaceman with his\nsober judgment of the minor decisions Sticoon had to make in flight.\n\n\"Why don't you try to contact Manning again, Tom?\" Sticoon suggested.\n\"He might be awake now.\"\n\nTom grinned, but in his heart he did not think it very funny. It was no\njoke that Captain Strong had called him to contact Roger. And Tom was\nworried. So far, he had not been able to reach the blond-haired cadet.\nHe settled himself in front of the communicator and began calling the\nblack ship again.\n\n\"Rocket ship _Space Lance_ to rocket ship _Space Knight_! Come in!\"\n\nHe waited. Nothing but static and silence greeted him.\n\n\"_Space Knight_, come in!\"\n\nHe waited again as the sleek white ship plummeted deeper into space\ntoward the first refueling stop on Deimos, one of the small twin moons\nof Mars. Still there was no acknowledging reply from the black ship that\nhad streaked ahead of them after the blast-off.\n\n\"I'm going to try to contact Kit Barnard,\" said Tom. \"Maybe he can pick\nup Miles' blip on his radar.\"\n\nTom made the necessary adjustment on the audioceiver and broadcast the\ncall for the owner-pilot of the _Good Company_. Finally, after repeated\ntries, he heard a faint signal and recognized the voice of his unit mate\nAstro.\n\n\"What's the matter, Astro?\" asked Tom. \"I can hardly hear you.\"\n\n\"We're having trouble with the by-pass lines to the generators,\" replied\nAstro. \"We've cut down to standard space speed, and Sid and Kit are\nmaking repairs now.\"\n\n\"Have you heard from Roger?\" asked Tom across the vast abyss of space\nseparating them. \"I've been trying to contact the _Space Knight_ for the\nlast six hours and can't get any acknowledgment.\"\n\n\"Haven't seen it,\" replied Astro. \"Lost contact with her a long time\nago. She moved ahead at emergency space speed and we lost her on our\nradar an hour after we blasted off.\"\n\n\"O.K., Astro. Hope Kit gets his wagon going again. We've got to make a\nrace of this, or the people throughout the system will be disappointed.\"\nHe turned and winked at Wild Bill.\n\n\"Listen, you curly-haired twerp!\" roared Astro, and it seemed to Tom\nthat he could hear his friend without the loud-speaker. \"We're going to\ngive you the hottest run of your lives when we get going!\"\n\n\"O.K., Astro,\" said Tom. \"If you can contact Roger, tell him to get in\ntouch with Captain Strong right away. He's probably blasted off on the\n_Polaris_ by now.\"\n\n\"Right, Tom. End transmission.\"\n\n\"End transmission.\"\n\nTom turned back to the skipper of the _Space Lance_ with a feeling of\ndespair. \"I can't figure it out, Bill,\" he said. \"Roger's pulled some\nboners before, real rocket blasters, but refusing to answer a call from\nStrong--\" He shook his head.\n\nThe audioceiver suddenly crackled into life. \"_Space Knight_ to _Space\nLance_, check in!\" Quent Miles' voice was harsh and clear.\n\nTom jumped back to the microphone. \"_Space Lance_, Cadet Corbett here!\"\nhe shouted eagerly. \"Go ahead, _Space Knight_! Where's Manning?\"\n\n\"Still asleep!\" replied Miles. \"Just wanted to tell you boys good-by.\nI'm not stopping to refuel at Deimos! I'm going right on through to\nGanymede! End transmission!\"\n\nOnly static filled the control deck of the _Space Lance_ as Tom clutched\nthe microphone and pleaded desperately for Quent Miles to answer him.\n\"Come in, Miles! This is Corbett on the _Space Lance_ to Quent Miles on\nthe _Space Knight_! Come in, Miles! Come in!\"\n\nBill Sticoon shook his head. \"Miles must be nuts trying to get to\nGanymede without refueling,\" he muttered. \"Traveling at emergency space\nspeed, he'll eat up his fuel before he gets one third of the way to\nJupiter!\"\n\nTom looked at Sticoon. \"And Roger's with him.\"\n\nSticoon nodded grimly. \"They'll wind up drifting around in space halfway\nbetween Mars and Jupiter. Finding them will be about as easy as looking\nfor a pebble in the Martian desert.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Have you found the _Space Lance_ yet, Astro?\" asked Kit Barnard,\nglancing over his shoulder at the giant Venusian, standing at the\nradarscope.\n\n\"I think I'm getting it now,\" said Astro. \"Either that or I've picked up\nan asteroid.\"\n\n\"Not likely,\" said Kit. \"We're too far from the belt to have anything\nthat big drifting around without being charted. It must be Sticoon.\"\n\n\"Boy!\" chuckled Astro. \"This reactor really packs a load of power!\"\n\n\"How are we doing on fuel, Sid?\" Kit called into the intercom.\n\n\"We lost a lot trying to prime the pumps,\" replied the young crew chief.\n\"We have to touch down on Deimos and refuel.\"\n\n\"That's all right,\" replied Kit with a smile. \"We're gaining on Sticoon\nfast. We should make Deimos about the same time. I wonder where Quent\nMiles is by now.\"\n\n\"Probably wishing he had stopped for fuel!\" interjected Astro with a\nsour look on his face.\n\n\"See if you can pick up Sticoon on the audioceiver, Astro,\" said Kit.\n\"Ask him for an estimated time of arrival on Deimos. One of us will\nhave to come in first.\"\n\nAstro flipped the switch on the panel and began his call \"_Good Company_\nto _Space Lance_, come in!\"\n\n\"Right here, Astro,\" replied Tom immediately. \"Boy, you certainly are\nburning up space! What have you got in your fuel tanks? Light speed?\"\n\n\"Just a little thing we whipped up,\" said Astro with a grin. \"What is\nyour ETA on Deimos, Tom?\"\n\n\"Less than five minutes. Four minutes and thirty seconds, to be exact.\nThink you can beat that?\"\n\n\"If we can't beat it, we can equal it!\" said Astro. \"See you on the\nMartian moon, buddy! End transmission!\"\n\nSteadily, the _Good Company_ rocketed through space, eating up the miles\nand gaining on the _Space Lance_. Both ships now made contact with the\ncontrol tower on Deimos and received landing instructions.\n\n\"_Space Lance_ will touch down on Ramp Three, _Good Company_ on Ramp\nSix,\" crackled the voice of the Deimos tower operator, \"and don't forget\nyour approach orbits!\"\n\n\"Have you heard from the _Space Knight_?\" called Tom.\n\n\"Sorry, _Space Lance_,\" came the reply, \"there has been no contact with\n_Space Knight_.\"\n\nTom began to feel the fingers of fear creeping up and down his spine.\nQuent Miles had carried out his plan of going on to Ganymede without\nrefueling, threatening not only his own life, but Roger's as well.\n\nSticoon completed the three circling passes around Deimos and shouted to\nTom over his shoulder. \"Stand by, Corbett. We're ready to go in!\"\n\nTom strapped himself into his acceleration chair and, watching the\natmospheric altimeter, a delicate instrument that recorded their height\nabove the surface of a heavenly body, began to call off the indicated\nfigures.\n\n\"Five thousand feet, four, three--dropping too fast--compensate for\nlesser gravity--two thousand, one, five hundred, two hundred--\" Tom\nbraced himself and seconds later felt the impact of the ship settling\nstern first on the concrete ramp. \"Touchdown,\" he sang out in a clear\nvoice.\n\nWhile Sticoon secured the control deck, closing the many switches and\ncircuits on the master panel, Tom opened the air lock. Almost\nimmediately, special-trained crews swarmed into the ship to refuel her\nand prepare her for the next lap of the race. Tom and Sticoon stepped\nout onto the spaceport of the tiny moon of Mars and gazed up at the red\nplanet that loomed large over the horizon. As a transfer point for the\ngreat passenger liners that rocketed between Venusport, Atom City, and\nMarsopolis, the refueling station at Deimos was well staffed and\nexpertly manned.\n\nStanding at the air lock, Tom and Sticoon heard the blasting roar of the\n_Good Company_ coming down in a fast, expert touchdown, and they hurried\nacross the spaceport to greet their rivals.\n\nWhen the air lock opened, Tom immediately began to kid Astro and Sid,\nwhile Sticoon and Kit Barnard compared flight notes. A Universal Stereo\nreporter rushed up with a small portable camera and conducted an\ninterview that was to be telecast back to Earth. Both spacemen were\nreluctant to voice any predictions of the outcome of the race, but Tom\nnoticed that Kit was smiling and seemed in good spirits. Tom, with all\nhis worries about Roger, could not help but feel happy that the\nindependent spaceman was proving his reactor.\n\nA man in the uniform of a Solar Guard major appeared. He introduced\nhimself as an official monitor of the race, appointed by Commander\nWalters, and asked them for a report.\n\n\"Captain Sticoon has followed all regulations, sir,\" said Tom.\n\n\"And Captain Barnard, Cadet Astro?\" asked the officer.\n\n\"Same thing, sir,\" replied Astro. \"Captain Barnard has followed the\nrules of the race exactly.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" replied the officer and started to turn away.\n\n\"Any word from the _Space Knight_, sir?\" Tom asked quickly.\n\n\"Nothing, Corbett,\" the officer replied. \"We received the same message\nthat Captain Miles would attempt to go on through to Ganymede without\nstopping here at Deimos for refueling.\"\n\n\"And you've heard nothing from him since, sir?\" asked Astro.\n\n\"Nothing, why?\" The officer looked at both of the boys sharply.\n\"Anything wrong?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" said Tom. \"It's just that Cadet Roger Manning is monitor on\nthe _Space Knight_ and we haven't been able to talk to him since we\nblasted off from Space Academy.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't worry about it if I were you, Cadet Corbett,\" snapped the\nmajor. \"I've heard of Cadet Manning's reluctance to stick to\nregulations. I suspect you will be hearing from him soon enough, when\nthe ship runs out of fuel and starts drifting around in the asteroid\nbelt. Those individualists always scream for help when they get in\ntrouble.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Tom stiffly.\n\n\"I already have a squadron of ships standing by to go to their\nassistance when they do send out a distress alert.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Tom. \"Will that be all, sir? Cadet Astro and I would\nlike to have a bite to eat before we blast off again.\"\n\n\"Yes, that will be all, Corbett. Don't wander off too far.\" The major\nturned and walked toward the ships without another word.\n\n\"Wonder what's eating him?\" said Tom.\n\n\"Never mind,\" said Astro. \"Come on. Let's grab a bite while we have the\nchance.\"\n\nThey headed for the restaurant in the control building of the spaceport,\nbut were recognized by the reporter of the stereo company who badgered\nthem into stepping before the camera and making statements about the\nrace. He tried to get the boys to commit themselves as to who they hoped\nwould win, and to offer an opinion on what had happened to the _Space\nKnight_. But neither Tom nor Astro said anything but that the best man\nwould win. There were the usual eager spectators too, thousands from the\nlarge cities on Mars who had taken the ferry rocket up to the spaceport\nto see the ships come in for refueling. As soon as Tom and Astro could\ntear away from the stereo reporter, they were mobbed by the onlookers\nwho clamored for autographs. Finally the two cadets had to forego their\nmeal and return to their respective ships to escape the wild\ndemonstration.\n\nSeated in his acceleration chair on the control deck of the _Space\nLance_, waiting for Bill Sticoon to come aboard, Tom found his concern\nfor Roger overriding his enthusiasm for the race. When Sticoon appeared\nand began to prepare the ship for blast-off, Tom went through the\nmotions mechanically. The _Space Lance_ was scheduled to leave first,\nwith Kit Barnard following at the exact time interval of their arrivals.\nThe Deimos tower operator's voice droned over the loud-speaker on the\ncontrol deck of the _Space Lance_ \" ... minus five, four, three, two,\none\"--then the breath-taking pause before the climactic--\"_zero!_\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe ship shot spaceward, rockets roaring loudly in the thin atmosphere\nof the small satellite. The next moment, before the horrified eyes of\nthousands of people, the _Space Lance_ exploded a few miles above the\nground.\n\nAstro stood frozen at the viewport of the _Good Company_, his eyes\nglazed with shock as he watched the Martian ship disintegrate far above\nhim. All he could do was mutter brokenly, \"Tom ... Tom ...\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 9\n\n\n\"Blast off!\"\n\nWithout any preliminaries, Kit Barnard's order sent the _Good Company_\nhurtling spaceward. Astro had just enough time to throw himself into an\nacceleration chair before the ship shot away from the Deimos spaceport\ntoward the wreckage of the _Space Lance_.\n\n\"Braking rockets!\" roared Kit. \"Hit them hard, Sid.\"\n\nThe ship bucked under the force of the counter-acceleration, and the\nveteran spaceman fought to keep her under control. He snapped out\nanother order. \"Cut all rockets!\"\n\nThe ship was suddenly quiet, hanging motionless in space in the middle\nof the still-twisting wreckage. The huge bank of atomic motors, the\nlargest single unit on the ship, had already begun to swing around the\nsmall moon Deimos in an orbit, while other shattered remains of the once\nsleek ship began a slow circle around the motors themselves.\n\nAstro was struggling into a space suit when Sid and Kit joined him in\nthe air lock. Quickly the three spacemen clamped their space helmets\nclosed and adjusted the oxygen nozzles. Then, after testing their suit\nintercoms, they closed the inner-portal air lock, reduced the air\npressure, and opened the thick pluglike outer portal. They stared out at\nthe gruesome spectacle of torn hull plates, twisted spars, and broken\npieces of equipment floating gently in the velvet space, outlined\nagainst the reddish hue of the planet Mars.\n\n\"Astro! Kit!\" shouted Sid through the suit intercom. \"Look, there's\nSticoon! Over there near that tube.\" Following Sid's pointing finger,\nAstro and Kit turned toward an exhaust tube that had been ripped in half\nby the explosion. The Martian spaceman's body floated next to it, limp\nand broken. Astro shuddered. If Sticoon was dead, then there was little\nhope for Tom. The big Venusian fought back tears.\n\nManeuvering themselves away from the ship with the aid of the small jet\npacks strapped to their shoulders, they reached the dead spaceman. Sid\ncarried him back to the ship while Astro and Kit remained to search the\nwreckage for Tom.\n\nBy now, three small jet boats and two rocket scouts had blasted off from\nDeimos, bringing emergency rescue equipment. More than a dozen men\npoured out of the ships and joined in the search. The work was carried\non in silence. No one spoke.\n\nAstro and Kit worked side by side, pushing their way gently through the\ntwisting mass that was once a proud spaceship, to the heart of the\nspiraling wreckage, down toward the bank of atomic motors that was\nattracting all the lesser pieces. Suddenly Astro paled. He gripped the\nveteran's arm and gestured toward a large section of the ship on the\nother side of the motors that they had not seen before.\n\n\"By the stars,\" Kit gasped, \"it's the air lock! All in one piece!\"\n\n\"If Tom managed to get in there, or if he was in there when the ship\nexploded, maybe he has a chance.\"\n\n\"You're right, Astro,\" said Kit hopefully.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"But we can't open it out here,\" said Astro. \"If Tom is inside, we have\nto take it down to Deimos. If we open it here, and he doesn't have a\nspace suit on, he'd suffocate.\"\n\n\"He'd freeze solid before that,\" said Kit, not mentioning the\npossibility that Tom might very well be frozen already, since the\nship's heating units had been torn away from the air lock.\n\nQuickly Astro hailed the members of the emergency crews that had\nrocketed up from Deimos and told them of the possibility that Tom was\ninside the chamber. They all agreed, since they had failed to find the\ncadet anywhere.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nKit and Astro immediately took charge of getting the bulky boxlike\nchamber back to Deimos where it could be opened safely. Two of the jet\nboats were jockeyed into position on either side of the chamber and\nseveral lengths of cable were stretched between them, forming a cradle\nfor the chamber. Since the jet boats were equipped with foldaway wings,\nwhich, when extended, would enable them to fly at slower speed through\natmosphere, they hoped to make a glider landing at the Deimos spaceport.\n\nAstro would not let anyone handle the boats but Kit and himself, and\nonly by threat of physical violence was he able to keep the regular\npilots out of the control chairs on the speedy little ships. He might\nsuffer for it later when the officers reported his actions, but the big\nVenusian was beyond caring. If Tom was not safe inside the vacuum\nchamber, he felt there wasn't much use in being a cadet any longer.\nFleetingly he thought of Roger, who didn't stand a chance of reaching\nGanymede on a single solo hop from Earth in a ship the size of the\n_Space Knight_. The _Polaris_ unit seemed doomed.\n\nWith Kit Barnard in one jet boat, Astro strapped himself into the\ncontrol chair of the other, and intercoms on, they gently fed power into\ntheir ships. Coordinating perfectly in their maneuvers, they headed back\nto the spaceport with their strange cargo.\n\nSlowly and gently, Kit and Astro circled lower and lower until the two\njet boats were directly over the Deimos spaceport. They circled wide and\nshut off power together, coming down in a long, easy glide. Keeping the\ncables taut between them, so the chamber wouldn't touch the concrete\nstrip, the two spacemen made perfect landings, coming to a stop directly\nin front of the control tower. Astro was out of his ship in a flash and\nalmost immediately Kit was beside him. They took no notice of the stereo\nreporter who was focusing his camera on their efforts to force open the\nportal on the chamber. Nor did they notice the immense crowd, standing\nbehind police lines, watching and waiting in silence.\n\n\"A cutting torch!\" bellowed Astro to the emergency crew below. \"Get me a\ncutting torch.\"\n\nIn an instant the torch was handed to him, and ripping the space gloves\noff his hands, the big cadet began cutting into the tough metal side of\nthe chamber.\n\nThe seconds ticked into minutes. The crowds did not move, and only the\nlow comments of the stereo reporter talking over an interplanetary\nnetwork could be heard above the hiss of the torch as Astro bent to his\ntask. A half hour passed. Astro didn't move or turn away from the\nblinding light of the torch as he cut into the section of the chamber\nwhere the portal locks would be. He did not notice that the _Good\nCompany_ and the emergency fleet had returned to the spaceport, nor that\nSid was now beside him with Kit.\n\nAn hour passed. It seemed to the big cadet that the metal he was\ncutting, alloyed to protect spacemen against the dangers of the void,\nwas now threatening to cost Tom's life, if indeed he still survived. No\none could live long under such conditions unless they had a fresh supply\nof oxygen. Kit tried to take the torch away from Astro, but the giant\nVenusian would not let him have it. Again and again, the tanks of fuel\nsupplying the torch were emptied and quickly replaced with fresh ones.\n\nThere was something awe-inspiring about the big cadet as he crouched\nover the torch, its white-hot flame reflected in his grim features.\nEveryone around him watched in silent fascination, aware that this was a\nrare exhibition of devotion toward a comrade. They all were certain\nthat Astro would reach Tom--or die in the attempt.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Touchdown!\" Captain Strong called into the ship's intercom. \"Secure\nstations.\"\n\nThe rocket cruiser _Polaris_ had just settled on the blast-stained\nconcrete of the Titan spaceport after a blazing flight nonstop from\nEarth. A Solar Guard cruiser, the most powerful class of spaceship in\nthe Solar Alliance, the _Polaris_ was also equipped with hyperdrive, a\nwell-guarded secret method of propulsion, enabling Solar Guard ships to\ntravel through space faster than any other craft known. Many commercial\nshipping companies, including those entered in the race to Titan, had\npleaded for the use of hyperdrive on their ships but were summarily\nrefused. It was one of the strongest weapons in the entire Solar\nAlliance.\n\nAs Commander Walters released the straps holding him securely in his\nacceleration chair and stepped up beside Strong, the Solar Guard captain\ngestured toward the teleceiver screen on the bulkhead.\n\n\"We're being met by the local officials, sir,\" he said.\n\n\"Ummm,\" was the commander's laconic reply as he studied the screen.\n\"There's Captain Howard.\"\n\n\"He doesn't look any too happy, sir,\" commented Strong.\n\n\"How would you feel if you had just spent seven years building up the\nmine operations here on Titan and then have something like this happen\nto you?\"\n\nStrong shook his head. \"You're right, sir. I forgot that Howard asked\nfor this duty.\"\n\n\"It's strange how a man will take to a place,\" mused Walters. \"The\nfirst time he returned to the Academy, after a tour of duty here on\nTitan, he looked like a man who had just fallen in love.\" Walters\nchuckled. \"And in a way I guess he had. He put in for immediate\npermanent duty here and went back to school to learn all about the\nmining operations. He, more than anyone else in the Solar Guard, is\nresponsible for our success here.\"\n\n\"Well, are you ready to leave the ship, sir?\" asked Strong.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the commander, but he continued to stare at the\nteleceiver screen. Strong waited respectfully and finally Walters turned\nback to him, shaking his head. \"The spaceport looks pretty deserted,\"\nwas his only comment.\n\nStrong had already noticed the desolate appearance of the ordinarily\nbuzzing spaceport and it troubled him more than he would show. He knew\nthat unless the defect in the force fields was corrected soon, the\nouter-space colony would have to be abandoned to the deadly methane\nammonia atmosphere. And to Strong, who had seen the dead satellite\nbefore the Solar Guard had discovered crystal there, it was like seeing\nan old friend sick with a deadly disease. In addition, the hundreds of\nthousands of colonists would have to be relocated if the force fields\ncould not be repaired and the effect on the economy of the whole Solar\nAlliance would be disastrous.\n\nWalters and Strong were met at the air lock by Captain Howard. \"I'm\nawfully glad to see you, sir,\" he said, coming to attention and saluting\nsmartly. \"Hello, Steve. Welcome to Titan.\"\n\n\"Glad to be here, Joe,\" said Strong.\n\n\"We came out as soon as we received your report that you had started\nevacuation,\" said Walters. \"Have you discovered anything new?\"\n\nHoward shook his head. \"Not a thing, Commander,\" he replied. \"We've done\njust about everything but take the force-field projectors apart, but so\nfar we haven't found a thing wrong.\"\n\n\"Any word on the race, Joe?\" asked Strong.\n\nHoward looked surprised. \"By the stars, I almost forgot. One of the\nships is trying to make it to Ganymede without stopping at Deimos for\nrefueling. And another blew up.\"\n\nStrong gasped. \"Which one?\"\n\n\"_Space Lance_,\" said Howard. \"Exploded over Deimos right after\nblast-off. _Knight_ is the one that's trying the long solo hop. Haven't\nreceived any word from him yet.\"\n\n\"But what about the crew of the _Space Lance_?\" demanded Strong with a\nglance at Walters.\n\n\"The pilot, Sticoon, was killed, and they haven't found Cadet Corbett\nyet.\" And then understanding flashed in Howard's eyes. \"Say, that's one\nof the boys in your unit, isn't it, Steve?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Strong grimly. He turned to Walters. \"Have I your permission\nto contact Deimos for the latest details, sir?\"\n\n\"Of course, Steve. Go ahead.\"\n\nStrong turned quickly and climbed into a nearby jet boat. The enlisted\nspaceman at the controls sent the tiny vessel skimming across the broad\nexpanse of the spaceport toward the control tower.\n\nWalters and Howard watched him leave. \"I hope nothing has happened to\nthat boy,\" said Walters. \"Corbett is one of the finest cadets we have.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid it doesn't look too good, sir,\" Howard answered.\n\n\"Well, what about the other ship, _Space Knight_?\" asked Walters. \"Cadet\nManning is on that one. Any report on where they are?\"\n\n\"Nothing, sir,\" replied Howard. \"We just heard that he was by-passing\nDeimos and going on right through to Ganymede, hoping to get a jump on\nthe other two.\"\n\n\"Did Cadet Manning make that report?\" asked Walters.\n\n\"No, sir. It was the pilot. Quent Miles. There was no mention of Cadet\nManning, sir.\"\n\nWalters shook his head. \"Certainly is strange,\" he mused aloud. Then he\nbarked, in his usual brusque manner, \"Well, we've got this problem here\nto worry about now. All mining operations have stopped, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. The men won't work unless they have a guarantee that their\nwives and children are safe.\"\n\n\"Can't blame them,\" said Walters, surveying the quiet spaceport.\n\nThe two Solar Guard officers climbed into another waiting jet boat and\nshot away from the _Polaris_ toward the tower.\n\nInside the shimmering crystal control tower, Steve Strong paced up and\ndown behind the enlisted spaceman trying to contact the Deimos spaceport\nacross the millions of miles of space.\n\n\"This is Titan spaceport calling Deimos spaceport! Come in, Deimos\nspaceport.\"\n\nThere was a flood of static, and then, very faintly, the voice of the\ntower operator on Deimos answered. \"This is Deimos spaceport. Go ahead,\nTitan.\"\n\n\"Transmitting request for information by Captain Steve Strong of the\nSolar Guard,\" the Titan operator called into the microphone.\n\"Information concerning explosion of rocket ship _Space Lance_. Please\ngive details on survivors.\"\n\nThere was a momentary pause and the loud-speaker crackled with static.\nThe voice of the Deimos operator broke through. \"Captain Sticoon dead.\nCadet Corbett believed trapped in air-lock chamber. They have just cut\nthrough the chamber. It will be a few minutes before I can give you any\nfurther information.\"\n\n\"Very well, Deimos. I will hold this channel open.\"\n\nWalters and Howard entered the room. \"Any word, Strong?\" asked the\ncommander. Strong shook his head.\n\nThe loud-speaker over the control panel crackled into life again.\n\"Ganymede station to Titan spaceport! Come in, Titan!\"\n\nThe three Solar Guard officers looked at each other in surprise as the\nTitan operator acknowledged the call. \"This is Titan. Go ahead,\nGanymede.\"\n\n\"We have just received word that the rocket ship _Space Knight_ is\nwithin five minutes of a touchdown this spaceport. Will probably blast\noff again immediately after refueling. Acknowledge, Titan!\"\n\n\"I read you, Ganymede!\" replied the Titan operator.\n\n\"What is your estimated time of arrival at Titan?\"\n\nThe Ganymede operator was silent a moment, then announced a time that\nmade Strong and Walters blink in amazement. \"It is based on his speed\nfrom Earth to this point, Titan.\"\n\n\"Very well, Ganymede. End transmission,\" said the Titan man, closing his\nkey.\n\nCaptain Howard stared at Strong and Walters in amazement. \"I can't\nbelieve it.\" Strong shook his head. \"It's fantastic!\"\n\n\"I know it is, gentlemen,\" said a voice in back of them. \"But\nnevertheless the Ganymede station confirms it.\"\n\nStrong, Walters, and Howard spun around to look into the smiling face of\nCharley Brett.\n\nBefore anyone could say anything, the voice of the Deimos operator broke\nthe stunned silence. \"Deimos to Titan, I have your information now. Are\nyou ready, Titan?\"\n\n\"Go ahead, Deimos,\" said the Titan man.\n\nAnd then, as Strong held his breath, the metallic voice from the\nloud-speaker reported on the final result of the tragic explosion over\nDeimos.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 10\n\n\n\" ... Chamber was cut open and Cadet Corbett was rushed to the\nspaceport's sick bay....\"\n\nAs the metallic voice of the Deimos tower operator continued his report\nof the tragic crash of the _Space Lance_, Strong and Walters sighed with\nrelief. At least Tom was not dead!\n\n\"He is still in a state of shock, but after a preliminary examination,\nthe medical officer reports that he will recover. That is all the\ninformation I have at this time, Titan. End transmission.\" The\nloud-speaker was silent except for the continuous flow of static.\n\n\"By the stars,\" breathed Strong, \"I'm sure glad to hear that.\"\n\nWalters put his arm around the captain's shoulder. \"I'm glad too, Steve.\nI know how you feel about those three boys.\"\n\n\"And that Astro,\" said Strong, beaming. \"Wouldn't you know he'd be the\none to rescue Tom.\" He paused and then continued thoughtfully, \"You\nknow, sir, with the exception of Manning, I'd be willing to recommend\nSolar Guard commissions for the unit right now.\"\n\nWalters snorted. \"Manning! By the stars, he could be the best astrogator\nin the universe, but--but he's so undisciplined.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, sir,\" the enlisted spaceman interrupted. \"Here is a\ntranscript of the report from Deimos if you care to have it.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Walters, putting it into his pocket. \"Well, Steve, I\nguess we'd better start to work here.\" He turned to the Titan senior\nofficer who had been waiting respectfully.\n\n\"Ready, Captain Howard?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Lead on, then,\" said Walters.\n\nAs the three officers turned to leave the control tower, they noticed\nCharley Brett sitting near the door. In the excitement of the news of\nTom's narrow escape, they had forgotten the company owner was there.\n\nStrong stopped and looked at him coldly. \"What are you doing on Titan,\nBrett?\"\n\n\"Came on ahead to welcome the winner,\" Brett replied easily, not even\nbothering to stand.\n\n\"Pretty confident your man will win, eh?\"\n\n\"Most assuredly,\" said Brett with elaborate sarcasm. \"I would never have\nentered a ship in the race if I didn't think I would win. Though, in all\nfairness, I think I should have received the contract to haul the\ncrystal without this extra effort.\"\n\n\"What kind of reactant is Quent Miles using in that ship of yours?\"\nasked Walters sharply.\n\nBrett smiled. \"The same as everyone else, Commander.\"\n\n\"What about your feeders?\" asked Strong. \"With ordinary reactant, and no\nnew cooling units aboard your ship, you must have oversized feeders to\nmake such fantastic speeds.\"\n\nBrett shrugged and held out his hands in a gesture of innocence. \"I\ndon't even know myself, Captain Strong,\" he said blandly. \"It's one\nreason why I have Quent Miles piloting for me. He has a few tricks that\napparently are quite effective.\"\n\n\"I hope they are legitimate tricks, Mr. Brett,\" said Walters. \"Let's go,\nSteve.\"\n\nThe three officers turned away and left Brett sitting there, smiling\ntriumphantly.\n\n\"I think we'd better start from the beginning in our inspection of the\nscreens, Captain Howard,\" said Walters, as the three officers left the\ncontrol tower and walked across the spaceport. \"First of all, I want a\ntwenty-four-hour watch placed on all operational centers, pump houses,\nand generator plants. I cannot discount the idea of sabotage. Why anyone\nwould want to wreck the screens is beyond me, but we cannot ignore the\npossibility.\"\n\n\"I already have men stationed at the main operational centers, sir,\"\nreplied Howard. \"Your Space Marines will help me cover the rest.\"\n\n\"Steve,\" said Walters, turning to the Solar Guard officer, \"if this is a\nnatural phenomenon--some new element in Titan's atmosphere breaking down\nthe force screens--the problem is bad enough. But if this is caused by\nman--if it really is sabotage--we'll have a doubly hard time. We can\nfind the reason eventually, if it is natural, but man can conceal his\nreasons. And until we find out the motives behind this we must count on\nthe situation getting worse. I want you to pursue _that_ line of\ninvestigation. Find out if anyone has a good reason to force the\nabandonment of Titan.\"\n\n\"It's a big order, sir,\" said Strong. \"I'll do the best I can.\"\n\n\"That's good enough for me,\" replied the commander, nodding his\nsatisfaction.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Any word, sir?\" asked Astro eagerly as the white-clad medical officer\nemerged from the room.\n\nThe man smiled. \"Thanks to you, Cadet Astro,\" he replied, \"your friend\nwill be able to leave as soon as he gets his pants on.\"\n\n\"Yeow!\" bawled Astro in his famous bull-like bellow. \"Thanks, sir.\nThanks a million!\" He turned and wrenched open the sick-bay door, almost\nsplintering it in his enthusiasm. Tom was just sitting up on the side of\nthe bed.\n\n\"Hiya, Astro!\" called Tom with a weak grin. \"The sawbones tells me I owe\nyou a brand-new shiny credit piece for saving my life.\"\n\nHis enthusiasm at high pitch, Astro was nevertheless unable to do more\nthan smile broadly at his unit mate. \"Only reason I did it,\" he said.\n\n\"All right, here you are.\" Tom handed over a coin. \"That's all I thought\nmy chances were worth.\"\n\nAt that moment the Solar Guard major in command of the Deimos spaceport\nentered, followed by Kit Barnard and Sid. After greeting Tom with\nenthusiasm that matched Astro's, Kit and Sid stood to one side quietly\nand listened while Tom gave his preliminary report to the major who\nheld a recorder microphone in front of him.\n\n[Illustration: _\"Yeow!\" bawled Astro. \"Thanks, sir. Thanks a\nmillion!\"_]\n\n\"I heard a terrific noise on the power deck as soon as we blasted off,\"\nTom began. \"And Captain Sticoon ordered me to go below and check on it.\nI saw the trouble right away. The lead baffles around the reactant\nchambers had become loose and the reactant was spilling out, starting to\nwildcat. I called Bill over the intercom right away and he ordered me to\nget into a space suit and wait for him in the air lock. I heard him shut\noff the generators--but that's all. The reactant blew and I must've been\nknocked cold, because the next thing I remember was this big ugly face\nbending over me ordering me to wake up.\" Tom grinned at Astro.\n\n\"I see,\" mused the major aloud. \"Now about the baffles. How could they\nhave worked loose? Do you think the lock bolts gave way in the excessive\nheat due to the intense blast-off speed?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" said Tom firmly. \"Those bolts were loosened. I distinctly\nremember seeing one of them fall to the deck as I walked in.\"\n\n\"Then you suspect that the ship was sabotaged?\"\n\n\"That's not for me to say, sir,\" said Tom after a moment's hesitation.\n\"In all my experience, I have never seen one of those bolts work loose\nof its own accord or because of heat or vibration on the power deck.\" He\nglanced at Astro, who was hunched forward, listening intently. \"Have\nyou, Astro?\"\n\nThe big Venusian shook his head slowly. \"Never,\" he said.\n\n\"Well, thank you, Corbett, that will be all for now,\" said the major and\nthen turned to Kit. \"I want to congratulate you, sir, on your sacrifice\nin going to the aid of the _Space Lance_.\"\n\n\"Wild Bill would have done the same thing for me,\" said Kit without\nemotion. \"Do I have permission to continue the race now?\"\n\nThe major was startled. \"You mean you still want to go on?\"\n\n\"Every cent I have is tied up in my ship and in this race, sir,\" said\nKit. \"I have my new reactor unit working properly now, and I believe\nthat I still have a chance.\"\n\n\"But you've lost hours, man,\" protested the major.\n\n\"I can make them up, sir,\" said Kit. \"Am I permitted to carry on?\"\n\nThe major was flustered, but nodded his head. \"By all means. Yes,\nindeed! And spaceman's luck to you.\"\n\n\"I'd like to make the trip with him if he'll have me, sir,\" said Tom,\ngetting off the bed. \"I'm all right. The doctor said so.\"\n\n\"But--but--but you need rest, Cadet Corbett,\" said the major. \"No, I\ncan't permit it.\"\n\nJust at that moment the medical officer walked in.\n\n\"So far as I'm concerned,\" he said, looking at Tom, \"he's a lot\nhealthier than you are, sir. With all due respect, sir.\"\n\n\"Very well, then,\" shrugged the major. \"Carry on! Do as you please!\"\nShaking his head in confusion, the major left the room.\n\n\"Well,\" said Kit Barnard, stepping forward, a big smile on his face,\n\"what are we waiting for?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Minus five, four, three, two, one--_zero!_\"\n\nThe spaceship _Good Company_ shot away from the small moon of Mars and\nthousands of eyes at the spaceport followed it into the heavens,\nwatching its blazing track disappear into the depths of space. If\nsympathy and good wishes could decide the race to Titan, the spaceship\n_Good Company_ was a certain winner.\n\nAboard the sleek craft, Tom Corbett relaxed after the tremendous\nblast-off acceleration and turned to look at the tense face of Kit\nBarnard who was seated in the pilot's chair.\n\n\"Why don't you get some sleep, Kit?\" said Tom. \"I can take this baby\nover. It's the least I can do for all you've done for _me_.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Tom, but I'll stay with it awhile longer,\" replied the veteran\nspaceman. \"At least until we find out where the _Space Knight_ is.\"\n\nTom suddenly remembered the trouble with Roger.\n\n\"Has there been any news of them at all?\" he asked.\n\n\"The last thing we heard was that he was approaching Ganymede. And that\nwas a few hours ago, when you were trapped in the air-lock chamber.\"\n\n\"Ganymede!\" Tom was thunderstruck. \"But--but--how did he do it?\"\n\nKit shook his head. \"I don't know, Tom, but he sure has some speed in\nthat black ship of his.\"\n\n\"Ganymede!\" Tom repeated in bewilderment. It was beyond belief. The\n_Polaris_, using hyperdrive, could scarcely have made the flight any\nfaster. Tom felt his heart sinking. The hope that Kit Barnard could\ncatch the black _Space Knight_ was faint now.\n\n\"Shall I call Ganymede again and see if they have anything new?\" Tom\nasked finally.\n\n\"Yes, do that, Tom,\" Kit replied.\n\nThe curly-haired cadet quickly climbed the ladder to the radar bridge\nand sat wearily in front of the teleceiver.\n\n\"Spaceship _Good Company_ to Ganymede spaceport,\" he called. \"Come in,\nGanymede.\"\n\nSeconds later, the voice of the Ganymede control operator crackled over\nthe loud-speaker in reply. \"Ganymede station to _Good Company_. Go\nahead.\"\n\n\"Can you give me any information on the departure time of _Space Knight_\nfrom Ganymede?\"\n\n\"She has not blasted off yet. She is having trouble in her after\nburners.\"\n\n\"How long do you estimate it will take for her to effect repairs and\nblast off?\" asked Tom, a note of rising hope in his voice. While the\nblack ship had made it to Ganymede under full power without refueling,\nthe strain might have damaged her seriously. Tom waited patiently for\nthe reply, drumming his fingers on the table in his excitement.\n\n\"Not more than sixteen hours, _Good Company_,\" the Ganymede operator\nfinally answered. \"Where are you now?\"\n\nTom quickly ascertained his position and relayed it to the tiny\nJovian-moon station. \"Space sector fourteen, chart B for baker.\" After\nthe metallic voice had repeated the information, Tom asked for\ninformation on Roger Manning.\n\n\"No such person has reported to this office, Cadet Corbett,\" came the\nnegative reply. \"End transmission.\"\n\n\"End transmission,\" said Tom gloomily and slumped back into his chair.\nSomething had happened to Roger, or he had completely blown his top. And\nin the light of past performances by the blond-haired radar expert, Tom\ncould not decide which. Roger had threatened many times that if he\nshould ever leave the Academy, he would do it quietly, without fanfare.\n\nThere was no better place to drop out of sight than on Ganymede, for it\nwas here that the deep spacers, gigantic spaceships that hauled supplies\nto the colonies of Alpha Centauri, Tara, and Roald made their last stop.\nIf Roger had finally made good his threat to leave the Academy, Ganymede\nwas the logical place to do it.\n\nBut why?\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 11\n\n\n\"Yeow!\"\n\nAstro's bull-like roar echoed through the _Good Company_. Tom and Kit\njumped around in their seats to stare dumfounded at the half-stripped\ncadet climbing through the hatch into the power deck, followed by Sid.\nSweating, his body streaked with grease, the belt of rocketman's tools\nswinging from his hips, Astro pounded the two spacemen on the back. \"We\ndid it!\" he roared, turning to hug Sid who was equally grimy and naked\nto the waist.\n\n\"Did what?\" demanded Kit.\n\n\"You know that by-pass feeder you said wouldn't hold a pressure of more\nthan D-18 rate?\" said Astro eagerly.\n\nWhen Kit nodded, Astro roared triumphantly, \"Well, it'll hold more than\nD-18 rate now!\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" demanded Kit.\n\nAstro's involved and detailed reply in engineering terms was almost\ngibberish to Tom, but he understood enough of the unit construction to\nsense that Astro had done something extraordinary.\n\n\"And he did it all himself, too,\" said Sid quietly. \"I didn't do any\nmore than hold the tools.\"\n\n\"But I still don't understand,\" protested Kit. \"The by-pass won't take\nmore than D-18.\"\n\n\"We built another one,\" said Astro proudly. \"Since you were making a\nsmall unit, you naturally built a small by-pass feeder. We made a big\none.\" Astro grinned. \"I admit that it looks a little lopsided, with that\ntank joint on the side nearly twice as big as the whole cooling unit,\nbut if you'll cut your motors and give me fifteen minutes to change that\nline, I'll give you a reactant feed at D-30 rate.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"D-D-30,\" stammered Kit. \"You're space happy!\" He glanced over at Sid.\n\"Is that right, Sid?\" he asked, almost hesitantly.\n\nThe youth nodded. \"It'll work, Kit. And believe me, I didn't have a\nthing to do with it. It was his idea and I thought he was nuts too. But\nhe can holler louder than I can and--well, he's bigger'n I am and--\" Sid\nshrugged his shoulders. \"He went and did it.\"\n\n\"I want to see that thing for myself!\" exclaimed Kit, jumping out of his\nseat. \"Take over for a while, Tom.\"\n\nTom slid under the controls of the sleek ship, and while Astro, Sid, and\nKit went below to the power deck, he began to figure their speed at a\nD-30 rate. He used a pencil at first, scribbling on a piece of paper,\nbut the answer he reached was so fabulous, he put the ship on automatic\ngyro control and climbed to the radar deck where he checked the figures\non the electronic calculator. When the result was the same, he let out a\nwhoop.\n\nWhen he returned to the control deck again, Astro, Kit, and Sid were\nalready working the master control panel, adjusting some of the controls\nto take the enormous increase in speed. Kit grinned up at Tom. \"Here we\ngo, Tom,\" he said. \"This is going to be the fastest ride you've ever had\nnext to hyperdrive.\"\n\n\"Then it really works?\" yelled the cadet.\n\n\"It not only works, but from the looks of that thing, we'll use very\nlittle more fuel. So now it's our turn to by-pass a fuel stop! We're\ngoing right on through to Titan!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You're whistling into the wind, Barnard!\" Quent Miles' voice was harsh\nand derisive as it crackled over the audioceiver. \"You could never catch\nup with me in a hundred light years! This race is in the bag for yours\ntruly!\"\n\nAcross the vast distance of space that separated the two speeding ships,\nTom, Astro, and Kit Barnard listened to Miles' bragging voice and smiled\nat each other. All Kit ever wanted was a fair chance, and now, thanks to\nAstro and Sid, he had better than a fair chance. With their added speed,\nTom calculated that the two ships would arrive at the Titan spaceport at\nabout the same time. Only scant minutes separated their estimated times\nof arrival.\n\n\"How much farther do you think that wagon of yours will hold out,\nBarnard?\" continued Miles over the audioceiver. \"You'll burn it up or\nshake it apart. This race is in the bag!\"\n\n\"All right, Miles,\" interrupted Tom. \"We'll do our talking at the Titan\nspaceport. Now let me talk to Roger.\"\n\n\"You mean, Manning?\" asked Miles, after an almost imperceptible pause.\n\n\"Yes, I mean Manning!\" snapped Tom.\n\n\"Can't oblige, Corbett,\" said Quent Miles. \"Your pal took it on the lam\nback at Ganymede. He ran out on me. As far as I know, he's still there.\nDidn't you see him when you stopped for refueling?\"\n\n\"We didn't stop,\" said Tom. \"What do you mean, he got off at Ganymede?\nHe's supposed to stay with you throughout the race.\"\n\n\"I gotta go now, Corbett,\" came Miles' abrupt reply. \"I'm hittin' rough\nstuff here, a swarm of meteors. See you on Titan. Be down there to\nwelcome you in.\"\n\n\"Wait! What about Roger?\" Tom called frantically into the audioceiver,\nbut Quent Miles did not answer. The young cadet slammed the microphone\ndown on the table. \"That blasted Roger!\" he cried hotly. \"When I get my\nhands on him, I'm going to--\"\n\n\"Take it easy, Tom,\" said Astro, putting a hand on the cadet's shoulder.\n\"You know how Roger is. Wait until he has a chance to explain before you\nblast him.\"\n\n\"I suppose you're right, Astro,\" replied Tom. \"But why in the stars\nwould he leave the ship?\"\n\n\"Whatever he's done, I'm sure Roger has a good explanation,\" replied the\nbig Venusian. But inwardly he couldn't help feeling that Roger, somehow,\nhad gotten into another scrape which would, in the end, reflect on the\nwhole unit. Neither Tom nor Astro cared much for their own individual\nreputations, but they were concerned about the record of the unit. Roger\nhad managed to pull himself out of some narrow scrapes, but there was\nalways the first time for everything. Leaving his post as monitor in the\nrace was as serious as anything he had done so far.\n\n\"Heads up, Tom!\" Kit called out. \"Meteor storm in our course. We've got\nto change our heading.\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" replied the young cadet, pushing aside his concern over\nhis unit mate and concentrating on routine flight operations.\n\nOn and on, the sleek ship plummeted through the black depths of space\nbeyond Jupiter, heading for the planet Saturn and her magnificent rings\nof different colors, and to her largest satellite with its deadly\nmethane ammonia gas atmosphere, the crystal-bearing moon, Titan.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"They are approaching the spaceport, sir,\" called the Titan\ncontrol-tower operator, and Strong jumped to the radarscope to stare at\nthe two blips on the screen. Only a mile separated them, with Quent\nMiles' _Space Knight_ ahead.\n\n\"Five minutes to touchdown,\" reported the operator.\n\n\"Come on, Kit,\" muttered Strong through clenched teeth. \"Pour it on,\nboy. Give her the gun!\"\n\nThe two blips drew closer to the heart of the scope. First one and then\nthe other shooting ahead for brief seconds as they began deceleration.\n\n\"You can see them outside, now, sir,\" said the operator, and Strong\njumped to the door, stepping out on the observation platform that looked\nout over the spaceport. He searched the skies above him, and then,\nfaintly, he could see the exhaust trails of the two ships as they\nstreaked over the field, beginning their deceleration orbits around the\nsatellite.\n\nBehind him, Strong heard the voice of the tower operator ordering Ramp\nFour and Ramp Five cleared for the two ships, and the mobs of people on\nthe spaceport surged back. Strong noted the irony of the situation. The\npeople of Titan were not out to greet a hero of space, but were waiting\nfor the next evacuation rocket ship.\n\nThe ramps were cleared and within minutes the two ships reappeared over\nthe horizon, nosing upward over the spaceport in an arc, their braking\nrockets blasting loudly as they prepared to land.\n\nThen, feeling that his heart would stop, Captain Strong saw Quent Miles'\nblack ship touch the surface of the spaceport first. Kit Barnard had\nlost the race. By seconds to be sure, but he had lost the race.\n\nA weak cheer arose from the crowds and then quickly died out. To them\nthe race was futile and the prize empty. How could the winning company\nship crystal, when soon, none would be mined?\n\nStrong raced across the field and boarded the _Good Company_ to find\nKit, Tom, Astro, and Sid sitting glumly on the control deck. There was a\nquick smile of greeting on the two cadets' faces when they saw their\nunit commander, but their smiles died away. Abruptly Kit Barnard was on\nhis feet looking past Strong to someone entering the hatch behind him.\n\n\"Congratulations, Quent!\" said Kit, extending his hand. \"That was a\ngreat race.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" replied Miles. \"But I never figured it would end any other\nway. You put up a great fight, Barnard. Yes, sir! A great fight!\" He\nturned to Captain Strong and chortled. \"Good race, eh, Strong?\"\n\nThe Solar Guard officer shook hands with the winner and then asked,\n\"Where is Cadet Manning?\"\n\n\"Say, I want to make a complaint about that!\" exclaimed Miles. He looked\nat Tom and Astro. \"It was bad enough to have to be bothered with these\nkids, but when they behave the way that kid Manning behaved, I've got a\nright to be sore!\"\n\n\"When did Manning leave the ship?\" asked Strong.\n\n\"As soon as we made touchdown on Ganymede. He left the ship after\nsleeping all the way out, made a couple of nasty cracks, and the last I\nsaw of him, he was heading over toward the deep-space section of the\nspaceport.\"\n\n\"You're sure of that?\" asked Strong.\n\nQuent Miles sneered. \"I just said that's what happened, didn't I?\"\n\n\"Yes, that's what you said,\" Strong replied. \"And I'll have to take your\nword for it until Manning can answer for himself.\"\n\n\"How did you manage to make it from Earth to Ganymede without refueling,\nQuent?\" asked Kit slowly. \"And what have you got in your ship to get\nthat kind of speed?\"\n\nMiles' lips curled in a twisted grin. \"That's my secret, spaceman,\" he\nsaid, turning away. \"Well, I've got to report to my boss. Great race,\nKit. Too bad there couldn't be more than one winner.\" He laughed and\nswaggered out of the ship.\n\n\"I'd like to brain that guy,\" growled Tom.\n\n\"All right, Corbett, Astro, pack your gear and report to the control\ntower for reassignment,\" snapped Strong. He turned and with a nod of\nsympathy to Kit left the control deck.\n\n\"Let's go, Astro,\" sighed Tom. \"We'll see you later, Kit. You too, Sid.\nAnd--\" They looked at each other, but there was nothing more that could\nbe said. The race was finished.\n\nWhen Tom and Astro had finished packing their gear and left the ship,\nSid turned to Kit. \"I'm going to take a look at the _Space Knight_!\" he\nannounced.\n\n\"Better not, Sid.\" Barnard shook his head. \"Miles is a rough customer.\nHe might not like visitors around his 'secret' on the power deck.\"\n\nSid's face was set. \"I'm going,\" he repeated and ducked through the\nhatch.\n\nHis face showing his disappointment at having lost the race, Kit paced\nthe deck for a moment and then he strode purposefully toward the hatch,\ncalling:\n\n\"Hey! Wait, Sid. I'm coming with you.\"\n\nIn the control tower at the far end of the spaceport, Tom and Astro\nentered the station commander's office in time to overhear the last of\nCommander Walters' orders to Captain Strong.\n\n\" ... might as well give the boys a rest before we begin our\ninvestigations, Steve.\" He looked up as the door opened. \"Oh, here they\nare now.\"\n\n\"Cadets Corbett and Astro reporting, sir.\" Tom and Astro saluted\nsmartly.\n\n\"Stand easy, boys,\" said Walters, rising to face them. \"I don't know how\nmuch you've heard of this emergency on Titan, but you can be briefed on\ndetails later. For the moment, all you have to know is that your\nassignment here is concerned with a detailed checking-out of the whole\nforce-screen machinery. Take a twenty-four-hour rest and then report\nback here ready for the hardest work you'll ever do in your lives.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Tom.\n\n\"Where is Manning? Didn't he think it necessary to report to me?\"\nWalters looked at Strong. \"Well, Steve? It's your unit?\"\n\n\"It seems he got off the _Space Knight_ at Ganymede, sir,\" replied\nStrong reluctantly. \"Captain Miles said the last he saw of Manning he\nwas walking toward the deep-space section of the spaceport.\"\n\nWalters' eyes suddenly became very bright and hard. \"He got off, did he?\nWell,\" he snapped, \"this is just about the end of the line for Cadet\nRoger Manning!\"\n\n\"I'm sure Roger has a good explanation, sir--\" began Tom.\n\nWalters glared at the cadet. \"None of that, Corbett. Manning is a bad\nrocket and the sooner I get rid of him the better off the Academy and\nthe _Polaris_ unit will be. Now take your twenty-four-hours' leave and\nreport back here ready to work.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Tom. He and Astro saluted and turned to leave the\noffice but were stopped by the sudden appearance of Sid and Kit. Sid's\nface was aglow. Kit was scowling.\n\n\"You know what we found on the _Space Knight_?\" exclaimed Sid, unable to\nhold back.\n\n\"What?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"Almost a full tank of reactant!\" replied the young engineer. \"And the\nafter burners showed about as much wear as if the ship had jumped from\nEarth to Venus.\"\n\n\"What's that, young man?\" snapped Walters, stepping forward quickly.\n\"What are you talking about?\"\n\nKit Barnard faced the commander and began to explain.\n\n\"We were both curious about Quent Miles' ship, sir,\" he said. \"We\nwondered what kind of equipment he had to get that kind of speed, so we\nwent aboard and looked her over. She looks as if she just made a routine\nflight. Hardly any of her baffling has been eaten away and her motors\nare cooling fast, and I'd swear by the stars there isn't anything on\nthat ship to give her the kind of speed she made out here.\"\n\n\"Hm-m! There's something funny about this,\" mused Walters.\n\nStrong stepped forward quickly. \"Would you like me to investigate, sir?\"\nhe asked eagerly.\n\n\"Of course not,\" snapped Walters. \"What's the matter with you? We've got\na whole planet full of people about to lose their homes and you want to\ntake time off to investigate pure speculation!\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, sir.\" Strong's face flushed at the rebuke.\n\n\"Carry on! Work with Joe Howard.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nStrong saluted and started for the door. He passed Tom, Astro, Sid, and\nKit without so much as a glance. His jaw was set like a rock.\n\nTom Corbett shuffled uncomfortably, embarrassed at the rebuke Strong had\njust suffered from Walters. It was not like the commander to flare up so\nquickly. The situation on Titan must be extremely serious. He and Astro\nducked out of the room quickly.\n\n\"Come on, Astro,\" muttered the young cadet. \"Let's get a bite to eat.\nI'm starved.\"\n\n\"I was,\" said the giant Venusian. \"But I lost my appetite.\"\n\n\"Boy, do I wish I had Roger here now!\"\n\n\"Yeah, me too!\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 12\n\n\nOlympia, the largest colony on Titan, was gripped by a wave of fear. The\nbroad streets were empty; the shops and stores were deserted; and the\npopulation waited in line at the spaceport, with their most valuable\nbelongings, for their turn to leave the threatened settlement. Slowly\nthe satellite of Saturn was dying, and through the methane ammonia\natmosphere, the glittering rings of the mother planet shone down on her\ndeath struggle.\n\nTom Corbett and Astro walked through the streets silently, overcome by\nthe desolation around them. Many parts of the city were completely\nabandoned, and the few remaining citizens wore cumbersome oxygen masks\nas the deadly atmosphere of gas seeped through the force field to reach\nthe ground surface of the satellite.\n\nAs the two cadets continued their dismal tour, they could only find one\nsmall restaurant open, a self-service food center that required no help.\nThey were the only customers. During the meal they hardly talked, as\nthey watched the slow procession of people outside, heading for the\nspaceport.\n\nWhen the two cadets left the restaurant, a jet car suddenly blasted to a\nstop beside them and a master sergeant, dressed in the scarlet red of\nthe enlisted Solar Guard, jumped out to face them.\n\n\"All persons are required to wear oxygen masks, Cadets,\" the sergeant\nannounced, handing over two masks. \"And I would suggest that you leave\nthis section of the city as quickly as possible. The screens are leaking\nbadly again. We may have to close off this section too.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nTom and Astro took the masks but did not put them on.\n\n\"Thanks, Sergeant,\" said Tom. \"But we'll probably be around here for\nsome time. We're on special duty with Commander Walters and Captain\nStrong.\"\n\nAt the mention of Strong's name, the sergeant started, looked at the\nboys closely, and then smiled. \"Say, aren't you Corbett and Astro?\"\n\n\"That's right,\" acknowledged Tom.\n\n\"Well, don't you remember me?\" asked the sergeant.\n\nTom looked at him closely and then smiled in sudden recognition.\n\"Morgan! Phil Morgan!\" he cried.\n\n\"Of course,\" chimed in Astro.\n\n\"Sure,\" said the sergeant. \"We went through our first test together at\nthe Academy and I washed out.\"\n\n\"And you became an enlisted man!\" exclaimed Tom. \"Man, you're a real\nspace buster!\"\n\n\"I figured if I couldn't get into space one way, I'd do it another,\"\nsaid Morgan proudly. \"A lot of times I wished I was still a cadet with\nyou, but now I don't think I'd change it for anything in the world.\"\n\n\"I can believe that,\" said Tom, smiling. \"And a master sergeant at that!\nMcKenny told us once it took a man nearly fifteen years to get top\nrating. It must really be a labor of love for you to have made it this\nquickly.\" He stuck out his hand. \"Congratulations, Morgan.\"\n\nThey shook hands. \"Well, I've got to get rolling,\" said Morgan. \"I sure\nhope you fellows find out what's cooking here. I've got a lot of friends\nhere and they stand to lose everything they own if Titan is abandoned.\"\n\n\"With Captain Strong on the job, you can bet we'll find out the\ntrouble,\" declared Astro.\n\nMorgan smiled. \"See you around,\" he said, and jumped back into the jet\ncar. A second later it was roaring down the street to the western part\nof the city.\n\n\"Boy, sure makes you feel good to know that a guy loves space so much\nthat he would fight his way to the top of the enlisted guard as Morgan\ndid!\" said Tom.\n\nSuddenly Astro jerked Tom by the sleeve and pulled him back into the\nrestaurant to crouch behind the door.\n\n\"Hey, what's the matter with you?\" growled Tom.\n\n\"Sh-h-h!\" hissed Astro and pointed across the street. \"Look!\"\n\nTom poked his head around the corner of the doorway and quickly jerked\nit back again. Quent Miles was hurrying down the street.\n\n\"Wonder what he's doing around here?\" whispered Astro, watching the\nblack-clad spaceman pass directly opposite them and continue down the\nstreet, seemingly unaware that he was being watched.\n\n\"He must be heading for the evacuated section,\" said Tom.\n\n\"How do you figure that?\" asked Astro, as they peered cautiously around\nthe edge of the doorway.\n\n\"He's wearing his oxygen mask.\"\n\n\"Come on!\" said Astro. \"Let's find out what that heel is up to.\"\n\nHugging the buildings, the two cadets walked down the street, following\nMiles. There was a puzzled frown on Astro's face as he stared at the\nspaceman, a hundred feet away. \"I swear, Tom,\" he complained, \"I'm about\nto bust a rocket. Every time I see that guy, I think I know him, but\nwhen I try to pin it down, it slips away from me.\"\n\n\"Watch it!\" cried Tom. \"He's stopping.\"\n\nThe boys ducked behind a deserted jet car as Quent Miles suddenly spun\naround to stare suspiciously back down the street.\n\n\"I don't know if he saw us or not,\" whispered Tom.\n\n\"With that oxygen mask,\" replied the big cadet, \"maybe he can't see very\nwell.\"\n\n\"He's going on,\" replied Tom. \"Come on. We've got to find out what he's\nup to. He wouldn't be concerned about someone following him if he\nweren't trying to hide something.\"\n\nThey slipped around the jet car and stepped back on the sidewalk. Ahead\nof them, Quent Miles was walking quickly, reading all the street signs.\nSuddenly he turned down a side street, and the two cadets raced after\nhim.\n\nThey were in the outskirts of the city now. Great areas were covered\nwith rolling grass fields where the citizens of Titan spent their\nleisure hours playing ball and picnicking, and it was easy for the\ncadets to follow the black-suited spaceman. They had to put on their\noxygen masks as the deadly fumes of the methane ammonia atmosphere began\nto swirl around them. They were near the outer limits of the atmosphere\nscreen's effectiveness.\n\n\"I think he's going into that building up ahead, Astro,\" said Tom, his\nvoice distorted to a low metallic hiss by the miniature amplifier in the\nface of the mask.\n\nAstro nodded and they ducked into a gully as Quent Miles turned once\nagain and glanced down the street.\n\n\"Wonder what's in that building?\" mused Tom.\n\n\"One way to find out,\" said Astro. \"Come on. He's moving again.\"\n\nThe gas began to thicken now, and the two cadets found it difficult to\nsee more than a few feet ahead as they moved cautiously through the\nswirling death around them. After what seemed like an hour, but was\nactually hardly more than a few minutes, they found the building Miles\nhad entered.\n\n\"I'd give two weeks' leave for a ray gun now,\" said Tom.\n\n\"Want me to try the door?\" asked Astro.\n\n\"Go ahead. We can't learn anything standing out here.\"\n\nAstro put his hand on the circular latch and twisted it slowly. The door\nslid back on rollers, exposing a dark interior. The two boys slipped\ninside.\n\n\"Better close the door, Astro,\" said Tom. \"The ammonia doesn't seem to\nbe so thick in here.\"\n\nAstro twisted the latch on the inner side and the heavy door rolled back\ninto place. They turned slowly and saw a room that was dark except for a\nsingle light gleaming weakly through the haze of the gas. When their\neyes became adjusted to the semidarkness, they moved, searching for\nanother door in the huge room.\n\n\"Are you sure this is the right place?\" asked Astro.\n\n\"I can't be positive,\" said Tom. \"The stuff outside was too thick--\" He\nstopped, touched Astro on the arm, and pointed to his left. There was\nthe sound of a door sliding back and light filtered into the murky room.\nQuent Miles stood framed in the doorway, the unmistakable outline of a\nparalo-ray gun in his right hand.\n\n\"Drop to the floor,\" hissed Tom.\n\nThe two cadets dropped lightly to the floor and lay face down, while\nQuent Miles walked toward them fanning the gun around menacingly. Then,\nas he was about to step on Astro's hand, he turned and walked quickly\nback to the door. \"You must be nuts, Charley,\" the two cadets heard him\nsay. \"There's nobody here.\"\n\nThe door rolled closed and the light was cut off. Tom and Astro rose and\nquietly made their way toward the door. They stopped, leaned against the\ndoor, and tried to hear what was going on inside, but were unable to\ndistinguish more than a vague mumble of voices, because of their masks\nand the thickness of the door. Suddenly, however, they were conscious of\nfootsteps approaching from the other side.\n\nThere was no time to hide. Each boy flattened himself against the wall\non opposite sides of the door and held his breath as the door opened\nslowly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"There can be no doubt about it, Steve,\" said Commander Walters to the\nyoung captain. \"What we need are more powerful pumping stations for\noxygen _and_ additional generators for supplying power to the force\nfield.\"\n\n\"How do you figure that, sir?\" asked Strong.\n\n\"It's simply this,\" replied Walters. \"The population here has nearly\ntripled in the past two years. The force-field screens were set up\noriginally to accommodate only a minimum number of miners and their\nfamilies. With the heavy demand for crystal, and therefore, more\ncivilians to dig it out, the force field has been overloaded.\"\n\n\"But I still don't see how, sir,\" Strong protested.\n\n\"The more people, the more oxygen needed to keep them alive, right?\"\n\nStrong nodded.\n\n\"The force screens hold back the methane ammonia gas and create a vacuum\ninto which we pump oxygen, right?\"\n\nAgain Strong nodded.\n\n\"Now we have a demand for more and more oxygen, and we pump it into the\nvacuum, but eventually we arrive at the point where the pressure of the\noxygen inside is greater than the pressure outside. Therefore, the\nscreening force field is broken in its weaker points and the oxygen\nescapes. When the balance is restored, the rupture isn't sealed and gas\nseeps in.\"\n\nStrong glanced questioningly at Captain Howard and at Kit Barnard, who\nhad been asked to remain on Titan and lend his assistance to the problem\nof the screens.\n\n\"Well, gentlemen?\" asked Walters, noticing Strong's glance. \"That is my\ntheory. Do any of you have a better one? Or a more reasonable\nexplanation?\"\n\nStrong, Barnard, and Howard shook their heads. A complete check of every\npossible source of trouble had been made by the four men and they had\nfound nothing.\n\n\"We still have to wait for a report from the electronics sections, sir,\"\nsaid Howard, rubbing his eyes. He started to get up and then suddenly\nslumped to the floor.\n\n\"By the craters of Luna!\" cried Walters, jumping to the young officer's\nside. Howard was picked up and placed on a nearby couch. While Strong\nand Kit loosened his clothing, Walters grabbed the nearest oxygen mask\nand slipped it over the spaceman's face.\n\n\"Funny that he should pass out like that,\" commented Strong, sniffing\nthe air. \"I _still_ don't smell anything.\"\n\nKit looked up at Strong and grinned. \"He's not gassed. He's asleep.\"\n\n\"Asleep!\" exclaimed Walters.\n\nThe enlisted spaceman standing on guard at the door stepped forward and\nsaluted smartly. \"Captain Howard hasn't slept for the last five days,\"\nhe said. \"He's been working night and day.\"\n\nWalters smiled. \"All right, Sergeant, take him to his quarters.\" Then he\nheld up his hand. \"No, let him stay where he is.\" He turned to Steve.\n\"Come on, Steve. You too, Kit. Let's see if we can't get a report from\nthe electronics section before we speculate any further.\"\n\nThe three men left the control-tower office under the watchful eyes of a\nsquad of Space Marines. Trouble had already started at the spaceport\nwhen a crowd of excited miners had charged a detachment of enlisted men\nguarding Solar Guard cruisers. The crowds were growing panicky as the\ndeadly gas filled the city, unchecked.\n\nStrong, Walters, and Kit Barnard climbed into a waiting jet car, amid\nthe hoots and catcalls from the waiting miners, and hurtled away to the\ngiant building housing the electronic \"brain\" that controlled the\nforce-field screens.\n\nWalters' face was grim. Beside him, Strong and Kit were silent as they\nraced through the empty streets. If there was no positive discovery by\nthe electronics section of the huge screening operations, then it would\nhave to be assumed that Commander Walters was right in his theory of\noverpopulation. To remedy that situation would require complete\nreconstruction of the satellite settlement and temporary abandonment of\nTitan. Millions of dollars would be lost and thousands of people thrown\nout of work. It would be a severe blow to the Solar Alliance.\n\nThe jet car slowed to a stop. They were in front of the electronics\nbuilding and the three men climbed out wearily. They would know in a few\nminutes now.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 13\n\n\n\"You're afraid of your own shadow!\" Miles snarled over his shoulder to\nCharley Brett who followed him out of the room. Brett was adjusting his\noxygen mask with one hand and gripping a paralo-ray gun tightly with the\nother.\n\n\"Never mind the cracks,\" snapped Brett, his voice muffled by the mask.\n\"I tell you I heard someone moving around in here.\"\n\nMiles laughed again and walked straight to the middle of the room. With\ntheir backs pressed to the wall beside the door, Tom and Astro saw Miles\nbend over and lift a trap door in the middle of the floor.\n\nThe two men flashed a light down into the opening and climbed down,\npulling the trap door closed after them.\n\nNo sooner was it shut than Tom and Astro jumped forward to examine it\ncautiously. Astro started to pull it open but Tom held out a warning\nhand. He turned and pointed toward the room that Miles and Brett had\nleft. Astro nodded and they walked quickly back to the door. Sliding it\nopen, they stepped inside.\n\n\"By the rings of Saturn!\" cried Astro.\n\n\"Well, blast my jets!\" Tom exclaimed.\n\nThe air in the room was clear, completely free of the misty whirling\nmethane ammonia of death that swirled around them outside. Recovering\nfrom his surprise quickly, Astro closed the door and walked to the\ncenter of the room, looking around curiously. Tom had already slipped\noff his mask and was examining the equipment lying on the floor. Astro\nbent over an oddly shaped machine that looked somewhat like an ancient\ncompressed-air drill, with a long bar protruding from one end. He\nexamined the bar closely and then turned slowly to Tom.\n\n\"Do you know what this machine is?\" he asked in almost a whisper.\n\nTom looked at it and then shook his head.\n\n\"I haven't seen one of these since I left Venus, and then only when I\nwas a kid hanging around the spaceports where the space rats used to\nblast off for the asteroids looking for uranium.\"\n\n\"You mean you hunt uranium with that thing?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"No, you dig it out with this.\"\n\nTom gazed at the machine thoughtfully. \"Why would it be here?\" he mused.\n\"It's already been used,\" said Astro, standing up. \"Look, the drill head\nis dull.\"\n\n\"That trap door!\" Tom exclaimed. \"It leads to a mine. Miles and Brett\nhave discovered high-grade uranium right here on Titan where everyone\nthought there was nothing but _crystal_!\"\n\nAstro nodded grimly. \"And that isn't all. This room is free of ammonia\ngas.\"\n\n\"But how in the star-blazing dickens can they keep it out of here when\neverything else outside is flooded with it?\" asked Tom.\n\nAstro spun around and began to examine the walls. \"Just as I thought!\"\nhe exclaimed. \"This room is airtight! Sealed! Oxygen is being pumped in\nhere.\"\n\n\"From where?\"\n\n\"Might be from somewhere below,\" replied the big Venusian. \"Down that\ntrap where Miles and Brett went.\"\n\nTom put his mask back on and headed for the door. Astro followed him.\nThey opened it a little and peered into the swirling mist.\n\n\"Then it's being pumped in directly,\" Tom asserted. \"Through a duct\nleading directly up into this room from somewhere below.\"\n\nAstro nodded. \"Then there's only one thing left to do. Go down through\nthat trap door and see what we can find.\" He stepped forward.\n\n\"Wait a minute, Astro,\" said Tom, stopping him. \"Let me check our\noxygen. There might not be any down there. Remember, Miles and Brett\nwore _their_ masks.\"\n\nMaking a quick check of their oxygen supply, Tom patted Astro on the\nback and started forward. \"It's O.K. We've got another four hours left.\nCome on!\"\n\nThey moved toward the trap door slowly.\n\n\"I still wish I had a ray gun,\" whispered Tom.\n\n\"As long as I can use these\"--Astro balled his hamlike hands into\nfists--\"we're O.K.\"\n\nWhen they reached the trap door, Tom got down on his knees and felt\naround for the opening. He found a small ring bolt, motioned to Astro to\nstep back, and pulled. The trap door swung back easily and a shaft of\nwhite light gleamed in his face. The young cadet leaned down and looked\nthrough the opening. What he saw made him gasp.\n\n\"What is it?\" demanded Astro.\n\n[Illustration: _Tom got down on his knees and felt around for an\nopening_]\n\nTom motioned for him to get down and look. The big cadet dropped lightly\nto his knees to peer through the opening. \"By the moons of Jupiter,\" he\nexclaimed, \"it's a--a mining shaft!\"\n\n\"Just what we thought it was,\" whispered Tom. \"Come on. Let's go down\nand find out where it leads.\"\n\n\"Maybe we'd better go back and tell Captain Strong about this first,\"\nAstro said speculatively.\n\n\"There's no telling what Brett and Miles are liable to do while we're\ngone,\" said Tom. \"You find Captain Strong and I'll go down into the\nshaft and look around.\"\n\n\"Not on your life,\" protested Astro. \"You don't think I'd let you go\ndown there alone, do you? _You_ go back to Captain Strong and _I'll_ see\nwhat those two are doing down there.\"\n\nTom grinned. \"O.K., we'll both go down,\" he said.\n\nOpening the trap door all the way, Tom eased himself down into the\nopening. Astro followed. Immediately below the trap, they found a\nladder, fixed to the wall of the shaft, which led directly down to a\npoint about thirty feet below the surface of Titan. At the bottom the\ntwo cadets paused. A long tunnel stretched before them.\n\n\"Listen to that!\" exclaimed Astro.\n\nTom ripped off the mask and listened. He heard a strange noise which\nsounded more like the roar of escaping gas than a motor.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"That's what I'd like to know!\"\n\n\"And that light,\" continued Tom, pointing down the length of the tunnel.\n\"Do you suppose it's Miles and Brett?\"\n\n\"It isn't moving,\" commented Astro.\n\n\"Well, since we're here we might as well find out as much as we can,\"\nTom decided. \"Let's go.\"\n\nThe two cadets flattened themselves against the side of the shaft and\ninched forward. The hissing noise was slowly building up to a roar now,\nand as they made their way along the shaft, they passed other smaller\ntunnels that branched off to the left and right. There was evidence of\nrecent work. Tools were scattered along the tunnel floors, as if the\nworkers had dropped them in sudden flight.\n\nThe light ahead of them grew brighter, and as they rounded a corner,\nthey saw a bare, unshaded lamp suspended from the roof of the tunnel.\n\nTom suddenly stopped and jerked Astro back. \"Look!\" he exclaimed,\npointing to the floor, not two paces away. A thin wire, hardly\nnoticeable, was stretched across the floor at ankle height.\n\n\"That bright light is to attract your attention while you trip over that\nthing and probably blow yourself to bits,\" he said grimly, pointing to\nthe wall where the wire was connected to a small charge of explosives.\n\"Nothing to bring the roof down,\" he continued, \"but enough to blast\nwhoever tripped over this wire.\"\n\nStepping over the wire carefully, they started down the shaft again, but\nTom paused thoughtfully.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" asked Astro.\n\n\"That booby trap,\" said Tom. \"We'd better not take any chances of\ntripping over it on the way back. We might be in a hurry.\"\n\n\"I know what you mean,\" grunted the big Venusian. He knelt down beside\nthe menacing box of explosives and quickly disconnected the trip wire,\nthrowing the box to one side.\n\nStraightening up, Astro announced, \"It's harmless now.\"\n\nCautiously the two cadets continued down the tunnel, the roaring sound\ngrowing louder and louder. After twenty minutes, Astro paused, his\nhomely features wrinkled in a frown of worry.\n\n\"Think maybe Miles and Brett went off into one of the other side\ntunnels?\" he asked.\n\nTom thought a moment. \"No, I don't, Astro. We haven't hit another side\ntunnel since we passed that booby trap back there. What would be the use\nof setting that thing up if they went in another direction?\"\n\n\"There must be another way out of here, then,\" Astro remarked.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"That part of the tunnel back there by the bomb was loose dirt. If the\nbomb had exploded, the whole tunnel would have been blocked off and how\ncould they get out?\"\n\nTom didn't answer. He was thinking about what he was going to do if\nthere should be another booby trap in the tunnel. It was so dark now\nthat they could hardly see more than a few feet ahead. The bright light\nwas merely a pinpoint in the distance behind them.\n\nAnd then Tom became aware that the roar that had been with them\nconstantly since they had entered the shaft had now lessened in volume.\nBut they had not passed a single branch-off tunnel where the sound could\nhave originated. Tom made up his mind quickly.\n\n\"Come on, Astro,\" he said. \"We're going back.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"I haven't time to explain now, but you walk close to one side of the\nshaft and I'll take the other. Feel along with your hands for anything\nlike a door or an opening. I think we've passed them.\"\n\nWithout another word, Astro turned around and headed back, feeling along\nthe tunnel wall.\n\nIt did not take the two cadets long to discover what they were looking\nfor. A heavy wooden door was set flush with the side of the tunnel. And\nwhen Tom pressed his ear to it, he could hear the roaring sound\nthrobbing heavily inside.\n\n\"See if you can open it, Astro,\" said Tom. \"But take it easy.\"\n\nAstro felt along the side of the door until he found a wooden latch and\nhe lifted it gently. The door swung back, as if pushed, as a powerful\ndraft caught it from the other side. The roar was now deafening.\n\nTom stepped inside cautiously, followed by Astro. They found themselves\non a small balcony overlooking a huge subterranean room. In the room\nthey saw Quent Miles and Charles Brett bending over a table on which\nwere several delicate electronic instruments. Tom and Astro recognized\nthem immediately as testing machinery for radioactivity, much more\nadvanced and sensitive than the ordinary Geiger counter. Around the two\nmen was ample evidence of Astro's original assumption that they were\ndigging into a hot vein of uranium pitchblende. To one side of the room,\nlead sheets lined a rough boxlike structure that Astro and Tom guessed\nwas covering for the radioactive vein. Against the wall lay the\nlead-lined suits used by the miners. Further to one side, Tom saw a\nhuge open pipe. He nudged Astro.\n\n\"Look, over there,\" Tom whispered. \"That's where the oxygen is coming\nfrom!\"\n\nBelow them, Miles suddenly walked to the pipe and pulled a large lever\non its side. The roaring sound stopped immediately and the boys felt the\nair pressure in the room lessen slightly.\n\n\"That blasted noise is driving me crazy,\" explained Miles, walking back\nto the table, his voice echoing in the rock-walled cavern.\n\nBrett, leaning over the table, was stabbing around futilely in one of\nthe sets of tubes in a complicated testing device. \"Wish we had that\nsquirt Manning here,\" he mumbled. \"He could fix these things up in no\ntime at all.\"\n\n\"I could always go back to the hide-out and get him,\" suggested Miles.\n\nOn the balcony Tom gripped Astro's arm tightly.\n\n\"Astro! Did you hear that?\" he exclaimed.\n\nThe big cadet nodded and started to rise from their place of\nconcealment. Tom pulled him down. \"Wait,\" he whispered sharply. \"No use\nbarging in on them yet. Maybe we can find out where Roger is first.\"\n\nAstro reluctantly crouched down again, his hamlike hands balled into\nfists.\n\nThe two cadets watched Quent Miles and Brett work on the instruments\nawhile longer. Finally Miles slammed down a pair of wire cutters on the\ntable and growled at Brett. \"No use messing with this thing any longer.\nI don't know what makes it tick, so I can't find the trouble. We need\nnew equipment.\"\n\n\"It'll take at least two weeks to get new equipment the way things are\ngoing here at Titan,\" replied Brett.\n\n\"Well, there's no use hanging around here if we can't dig any more of\nthe stuff out, and I ain't going behind that lead shield unless I got a\nmachine that tells me it's safe.\"\n\n\"I've been thinking about Manning,\" said Brett.\n\n\"What about him?\"\n\n\"Suppose we move the stuff we've already mined to the hide-out, and take\nthis equipment along too. He can repair it out there. We can turn off\nthe oxygen that we're sucking off from the Solar Guard pumps, and by the\ntime we get back here, the old satellite will be back to normal. Then,\nwith the equipment repaired and Olympia back to normal, we can really\nbegin operations.\"\n\nQuent nodded quickly. \"Good idea. Come on. Let's get this stuff aboard\nthe ship.\"\n\nOn the balcony Tom and Astro looked at each other.\n\n\"They're responsible for what's happened here on Titan!\" whispered Tom.\n\"They have been sucking off oxygen from the main pumps supporting the\nforce field.\"\n\n\"Come on, Tom,\" growled Astro. \"My fist is just itching to make contact\nwith a couple of no-good chins.\"\n\n\"Not so fast! We still don't know where they've got Roger.\"\n\n\"You want to keep on following them?\" asked Astro.\n\n\"At least to their ship,\" Tom replied. \"Then we can notify Captain\nStrong and he can track them in the _Polaris_. If we barge in on them\nnow, we'll just get the satisfaction of knocking their heads together\nwith no guarantee of any information.\" The young cadet turned to the\ndoor. \"We'll sneak up the tunnel a way and then follow them out.\"\n\n\"Hurry!\" said Astro. \"Here they come.\" Quent, carrying one of the\ninstruments, had started up the steps to the balcony.\n\nTom grabbed the latch and pushed up but the door would not open. \"Give\nme a hand, Astro, quick!\" he called.\n\nAstro grabbed the latch and heaved his bulk against the door. Suddenly\nhe stepped back dumfounded, holding the latch in his hand. It had\nsnapped off.\n\nJust at that moment Brett looked up and saw them. He shouted a warning\nto Miles, who dropped the instrument he was carrying and pulled out his\nray gun.\n\n\"Just stand where you are!\" he snarled, leveling the gun at them.\n\nTom and Astro stood quietly, hands in the air.\n\n\"How in blazes did they get here?\" Brett cried.\n\n\"They must have followed me,\" said Miles. \"They certainly couldn't have\nknown about this place.\"\n\n\"But how did they get past the trap?\" Brett persisted, still amazed and\nshaken by the unexpected appearance of the cadets.\n\nAstro snorted his contempt. \"You must think we're a couple of prize\nspace jerks,\" he growled. \"You can't even kill a mouse with that thing\nnow.\"\n\n\"Let's cut the talk,\" said Miles. \"What do we do with them?\"\n\n\"Freeze them!\" snapped Brett. \"No telling how long they've been here and\nhow much they know.\"\n\n\"We know enough to put you on a prison asteroid,\" challenged Tom.\n\n\"Freeze 'em, it is,\" said Quent. \"We'll get the ship loaded and decide\nwhat to do with them later.\"\n\nHe pressed the trigger on his ray gun. There was a harsh crackling sound\nand Tom and Astro stiffened into immobility, every nerve and muscle\ndeadened. With the exception of their hearts, and sense of seeing and\nhearing, they might have been dead men.\n\nLaughing to themselves, Quent Miles and Charles Brett picked up their\ninstruments, walked past them, and disappeared through the door.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 14\n\n\nCharles Brett swaggered into the control room of the electronics\nbuilding. Commander Walters, Captain Strong, and Kit Barnard looked up\nfrom their study of the reports the chief engineer had handed them.\n\n\"What are you doing here, Brett?\" demanded Walters. \"I thought you had\nblasted out of here long ago.\"\n\n\"I'm leaving as soon as we sign the contracts for hauling the crystal,\nCommander,\" said Brett.\n\n\"Contracts!\" exploded Strong. \"Why, man, do you realize that this\nsatellite is about to die? If we don't find out what's wrong with the\nscreens, there won't be any crystal mined here for the next ten years.\"\n\nBrett shook his head and smiled. \"That's all right with me too,\" he\nsaid. \"The contracts call for either party to satisfy the other should\neither party fail to fulfill the contractual agreements. In other words,\nStrong, I get paid for making the trip out to Titan, whether you have\ncrystal to haul or not.\"\n\n\"Why, you dirty--\" snarled Strong.\n\n\"Just a moment, Steve,\" Walters interrupted sharply. \"Brett's right. We\nhad no way of knowing that this situation would arise, or grow worse\nthan it was in the beginning. Brett went to a great deal of expense to\nenter the race and win it. If he insists that the Solar Guard abide by\nthe contract, there's nothing we can do but pay.\"\n\n\"It won't be too bad, Commander Walters,\" said Brett. \"I have my ship\nloaded with crystal now, and if you'll just sign the contracts, I can\ndeliver one cargo of crystal to Atom City before Titan is abandoned.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" cried Strong. \"Who gave you the right to load crystal\nbefore signing the contract?\"\n\n\"I assumed the right, Captain Strong,\" replied Brett smoothly. \"My ship\nwon the race, didn't it? Why shouldn't I start work right away?\"\n\n\"Well, that's beside the point now, anyway,\" Walters said. \"We may need\nyour ship to take miners and their families to Ganymede or Mars, Brett.\nNever mind the crystal. One load won't mean very much, anyway.\"\n\n\"No, thank you,\" growled Brett. \"I don't haul any miners in my ship. The\ncontracts call for crystal and that's all.\"\n\n\"I'm ordering you to take those people, Brett,\" said Walters coldly.\n\"This is an emergency.\"\n\n\"Order all you want,\" snapped Brett. \"Look at your space code book,\nsection four, paragraph six. My rights are fully protected from\nhigh-handed orders issued by men like you who think they're bigger than\nthe rest of the people.\"\n\nWalters flushed angrily. \"Get out!\" he roared.\n\n\"Not till you sign that contract,\" Brett persisted. \"And if I don't\nleave with a signed contract in my pocket, I'll have you up before the\nSolar Alliance Council on charges of fraud. You haven't got a leg to\nstand on and you know it. Now sign that contract.\"\n\nAbruptly, Walters turned to an enlisted spaceman and instructed him to\nget his brief case from the _Polaris_, then deliberately turning his\nback on Brett, continued his study of the report. Strong and Kit Barnard\nwatched Brett with narrowed eyes as the arrogant company owner crossed\nto the other side of the room and sat down.\n\n\"You know something, Steve,\" said Kit quietly. \"Back at the Academy, I\nfailed to register a protest about someone dumping impure reactant into\nmy feeders.\"\n\n\"What about it?\" asked Strong.\n\n\"I'd like to register that protest now.\"\n\n\"Now?\" Steve looked at him, a frown on his face. \"Why now?\"\n\n\"For one thing, Brett couldn't blast off until there was an\ninvestigation.\"\n\n\"You might have something there, Kit,\" replied Strong with a smile.\n\"_And_ since Brett won the race under such--er--mysterious\ncircumstances, I'd suggest an investigation of the black ship as well,\neh?\"\n\nKit grinned. \"Shall I make that a formal request?\"\n\n\"Right now, if you like.\"\n\nKit turned to face Commander Walters. \"Commander,\" he announced, \"I\nwould like to register a formal protest with regard to the race.\"\n\nWalters glanced up. \"Race?\" he growled. \"What the devil are you talking\nabout, Kit?\"\n\n\"Captain Barnard seems to think that Mr. Brett's ship might have used\nequipment that was not standard, sir,\" Strong explained. \"In addition,\nhis own ship was sabotaged during the time trials.\"\n\nWalters looked at Strong and then at Kit Barnard, unable to understand.\n\"What's happened to you two? Bringing up a thing like that at this time.\nHave you lost your senses?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" replied Kit. \"But I believe that if a formal investigation\nwas started, the Solar Guard would be within its legal rights to delay\nsigning the contracts until such investigation was completed.\"\n\nWalters grinned broadly. \"Of course! Of course!\"\n\nBrett jumped up and stormed across the room. \"You can't get away with\nthis, Walters!\" he shouted. \"I won this race fairly and squarely. You\nhave to sign that contract.\"\n\n\"Mr. Brett,\" said Walters coldly, \"under the circumstances, I don't have\nto do a space-blasted thing.\" He turned to Kit. \"Is this a formal\nrequest for an investigation, Kit?\" He was smiling.\n\n\"It is, sir.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Walters, turning to Brett. \"Mr. Brett, in the presence\nof two witnesses, I refuse to sign the contracts as a result of serious\ncharges brought against you by one of the participating entrants. You\nwill be notified of the time and place of the hearing on these charges.\"\n\nBrett's face turned livid. \"You can't do this to me!\"\n\nWalters turned to one of the enlisted guardsmen. \"Escort Mr. Brett from\nthe room,\" he ordered.\n\nA tall, husky spaceman unlimbered his paralo-ray rifle and nudged Brett\nfrom the room. \"I'll get even with you, Walters, if it's the last thing\nI do,\" he screamed.\n\n\"You make another threat like that to a Solar Guard officer,\" growled\nthe enlisted spaceman, \"and it'll be the _last_ thing you do.\"\n\nAs the door closed, Walters, Strong, and Kit laughed out loud. A few\nseconds later, as the three men returned to their study of the report,\nthere was a distant rumble, followed quickly by the shock wave of a\ntremendous explosion. Walters, Strong, and Kit and everyone in the room\nwere thrown to the floor violently.\n\n\"By the craters of Luna,\" yelled Strong, \"what was that?\"\n\n\"One of the smaller screens has given way, sir!\" yelled the chief\nelectronic engineer after a quick glance at the giant control board.\n\"Number seven.\"\n\nWalters struggled to his feet. \"Where is it?\" he demanded.\n\nStrong and Kit got to their feet and crowded around the commander as the\nengineer pointed out the section on the huge map hanging on the wall.\n\n\"Here it is, sir,\" he said. \"Sector twelve.\"\n\n\"Has that area been evacuated yet?\" asked Strong.\n\n\"I don't know, sir,\" replied the engineer. \"Captain Howard was in charge\nof all evacuation operations.\"\n\nWalters spun around. \"Get Howard, Steve. Find out if that part of the\ncity has been cleared,\" he ordered and then turned to Kit. \"You, Kit,\ntake the Space Marines and round up every spare oxygen mask you can find\nand get it over to that section right away. I'll meet you here\"--he\nplaced his finger on the map--\"with every jet car I can find. No telling\nhow many people are still there and we have to get them out.\"\n\nAlmost immediately the wailing of emergency sirens could be heard\nspreading the alarm over the city. At the spaceport, where the citizens\nwere waiting to be taken off the satellite, small groups began to charge\ntoward the loading ships in a frenzy of fear. Since Titan had been\ncolonized, there had never been a single occasion where the sirens had\nwarned of the failure of the screens. There had been many tests,\nespecially for the school-age children and the miners working far below\nthe surface of the satellite, but this was the first time the sirens\nhowled a real warning of danger and death.\n\nStrong raced back to the control tower of the spaceport in a jet car and\nburst into the room where the captain was still asleep on the couch.\nStrong shook him violently.\n\n\"Wake up, Joe!\" he cried. \"Come on. Wake up.\"\n\n\"Uh--ahhh? What's the--?\" Howard sat up and blinked his eyes. \"Steve,\nwhat's going on?\"\n\n\"The screen at sector twelve has collapsed. How many people are still in\nthere?\"\n\n\"Collapsed! Sector twelve?\" Howard, still groggy with sleep, dumbly\nrepeated what Strong had said.\n\nStrong drew back his hand and slapped him across the face. \"Come out of\nit, Joe!\" he barked.\n\nHoward reeled back and then sat up, fully awake.\n\n\"What--what did you say?\" he stammered.\n\n\"Sector twelve has gone,\" Strong repeated. \"How many people are left\nthere?\"\n\n\"We haven't even begun operations there yet,\" Howard replied grimly.\n\"How long have I been asleep?\"\n\n\"A couple of hours.\"\n\n\"Then there's still time.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Just before I folded, I ordered the evacuation crews to start working\non sector eleven. They should be finished now and just about starting on\ntwelve. If they have, we have a good chance of saving everyone.\"\n\n\"Let's go.\"\n\nThe two men raced out of the control tower to the jet car and roared\nthrough the desolate streets of the city. All around them commandeered\njet cars raced toward the critical area. Commander Walters stood in the\nmiddle of an intersection on the main road to sector twelve, waving his\narms and shouting orders to the enlisted guardsmen and volunteer miners\nthat had raced back into the city to help. On the sidewalk, enlisted\nguardsmen handed out extra oxygen masks to the men who would search the\narea for anyone who might not have gotten out before the screen\nexploded. The main evacuation force that had been under Howard's\nsupervision had already moved in but there was still a large area to\ncover.\n\n\"We'll split up into six sections!\" roared Walters, standing on top of a\njet car. \"Go down every street and alley, and make a house-to-house\nsearch. Cover every square inch of the sector. If we lose one life, we\nwill have failed. Move out!\"\n\nWith Strong, Kit, Howard, Walters, and other officers of the Solar Guard\nin the lead, the grim lines of men separated into smaller groups and\nstarted their march through the deserted city. The swirling gas already\nwas down to within a hundred feet of the street level. When it dropped\nto the surface, each man knew there would be little hope for anyone\nremaining alive without oxygen masks.\n\nEvery room of every house and building was searched, as over all, the\ndeadly swirling gas dropped lower and lower and the pressure of the\noxygen was dissipated.\n\nOnce, Strong broke open the door to a cheap rooming house and raced\nthrough it searching each room. He found no one, but something made him\ngo back through the first-floor rooms again. Under a bed in a room at\nthe end of the hall he found a young boy huddled with his dog, wide-eyed\nwith fear. Such incidents were repeated over and over as the searchers\ncame upon sleeping miners, sick mothers and children, elderly couples\nthat were unable to move. Each time they were taken outside to a jet car\nwhere masks were strapped over their faces, and then driven to the\nspaceport. And, all the while, the deadly methane ammonia gas dropped\nlower and lower until it was within ten feet of the ground.\n\nThere were only a few buildings left to search now. The lines of the men\nhad reached the open grassy areas surrounding the city proper, and as\nthey collected in groups and exchanged information, Walters gathered\nthem together.\n\n\"You've done a fine job, all of you,\" he said. \"I don't think there's a\nliving thing left in this entire sector. All volunteers and the first\nfour squads of enlisted guardsmen and second detachment of Space Marines\nreturn to the spaceport and prepare to abandon Titan. Give all the aid\nto the officer in charge that you can. Again, I want to thank you for\nyour help.\"\n\nAs the group of men broke up and began drifting away, Walters hurried\nover to Strong and Kit Barnard. \"Steve,\" he said, \"I want you to\nsupervise the evacuation at the spaceport. Since this screen has blown\nup, those poor people are frightened out of their wits. And they have a\nright to be. If a major screen blew instead of a small one, we really\nwould be in trouble.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir,\" replied Strong. \"Come on, Kit, you might as well blast\noff with a load of children.\"\n\n\"Sure thing.\"\n\n\"Just a minute,\" Walters interrupted. \"I would consider it a service,\nKit, if you would send your young assistant back with your ship and you\nstick around until we get all the people safely off.\"\n\n\"Anything I can do to help, sir,\" replied Kit.\n\nAt that moment a tall enlisted spaceman walked up to Walters and saluted\nsharply. Walters noticed the stripes on his sleeve and his young-looking\nface. He couldn't remember ever seeing such a young master sergeant.\n\n\"Captain Howard asked me to make my report to you, sir,\" said the\nguardsman.\n\n\"Very well, sergeant,\" said Walters.\n\nThe young spaceman made a detailed report of his search through sectors\neleven and twelve. While he spoke, Strong kept looking at him, puzzled.\nWhen the guardsman had finished, Strong asked, \"Don't I know you from\nsomewhere, Sergeant?\"\n\nThe guardsman smiled. \"You sure do, Captain Strong. My name's Morgan,\nsir. I was a cadet with Tom Corbett and Astro, sir, but I washed out. So\nI joined the enlisted guard.\"\n\n\"Congratulations, Sergeant,\" said Walters. \"You're the youngest top kick\nI've ever seen.\" He turned to Strong. \"Apparently we slipped up, Steve,\nletting this chap get out of the Academy so he could make a name for\nhimself in the enlisted ranks.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" replied Morgan, blushing with pride.\n\n\"Have you seen the cadets, by any chance, Sergeant?\" asked Strong.\n\"They're both here on Titan with me.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, sir,\" said Morgan. \"I saw them some time ago.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"A few blocks closer to the heart of town,\" said Morgan, pointing back\ndown the avenue. \"We were just starting in on sector eleven and I saw\nthem coming out of a restaurant.\"\n\n\"Funny they haven't returned,\" commented Walters. \"And what would they\nbe doing down there?\"\n\nStrong's forehead creased into a frown of worry. \"Sir, I wonder if you'd\nallow me a half hour or so to look for them?\" he asked. \"If they were\nanywhere near this section when the screen collapsed, they could have\nbeen injured by the sudden release of pressure.\"\n\n\"They had masks, sir,\" said Morgan. \"I gave them a couple myself.\"\n\nWalters thought a moment. \"It's just possible they might have been\ninjured in some way,\" he mused. \"Go ahead, Steve. If you don't find\nthem, and they don't show up at the spaceport, we'll organize a full\nsearch.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said Strong. \"You come along with me, Sergeant.\"\n\nAdjusting their oxygen masks, Captain Strong and Sergeant Morgan strode\ndown the street through the swirling mist of deadly methane ammonia to\nbegin their search for Tom and Astro.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 15\n\n\n\"Listen!\"\n\nCaptain Strong grabbed the young master sergeant by the arm and stood\nstock-still in the swirling methane ammonia gas, his eyes searching the\nmisty sky.\n\n\"What is it, sir?\" asked Morgan.\n\n\"A spaceship decelerating,\" said Strong, \"coming in for a touchdown!\"\n\n\"I think I hear it now, sir!\" said Morgan.\n\n\"Can you figure out where it is? I can't see a blasted thing.\"\n\n\"Sounds to me as though it's to the left, sir.\"\n\n\"O.K., let's go and investigate,\" said Strong. \"There isn't any good\nreason for a ship coming down in this deadly soup--or in this area.\"\n\nWalking slowly and cautiously, the two spacemen angled to the left,\npeering through the clouds of gas that seemed to get thicker as they\nmoved along. The roaring blast of the ship became louder.\n\nStrong put his hand out to stop Morgan. \"Let's hold up a minute,\nSergeant,\" he said. \"I don't want to get too close until I know what\nwe're facing.\"\n\nThey stood absolutely still, the gas swirling around them in undulating\nclouds that grew thicker one minute and then thinned out again. As the\ngas thinned for a few seconds, Strong gasped and pointed.\n\n\"Look!\" he cried. \"By the craters of Luna, it's Brett's ship!\"\n\n\"Brett?\" asked Morgan.\n\n\"Charles Brett. He owns that ship. It's the one that won the space race\nfrom Earth. Now, what would he be doing landing out here?\"\n\n\"I think he came down beside that warehouse up ahead, sir,\" said Morgan,\nas the gas cloud closed in again, cutting off their view of the actual\nlanding. \"It used to be a storehouse for mining gear a couple of years\nago, but it's been empty for some time.\"\n\n\"I think we'd better check this, Sergeant,\" said Strong firmly. \"Come\non.\"\n\nStrong started forward, then stopped, as a particularly heavy cloud of\nthe deadly gas swirled around them. The two spacemen clung together\nblinded by the dense methane ammonia that would kill them in thirty\nseconds should their oxygen masks fail. In a moment the foggy death\nthinned out again and they continued toward the warehouse and the sleek\nblack ship behind it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTom Corbett and Astro heard the roaring blast of the ship's exhaust.\nThey saw Brett and Miles haul the instruments out of the cavern. They\nsaw; they could hear; but they could not move. For nearly three hours\nthey had remained alone in the cavern, frozen in the exact position they\nwere in when Quent Miles had blasted them with his paralo-ray gun. And\nthen Brett and Miles were standing before them again, Miles covering\nthem with his paralo-ray gun.\n\n\"Why should we break our backs loading the ship?\" sneered Miles. \"Let\nthem carry it out for us.\"\n\n[Illustration: _\"Look!\" Strong cried. \"It's Brett's ship!\"_]\n\n\"All right, release them,\" agreed Brett. \"But get that stuff loaded in\na hurry. Walters is either getting suspicious or he's pulling a bluff.\nWe can't take any more chances.\"\n\nMiles flipped on the neutralizer switch of the paralo ray and leveled it\nat Tom. \"We'll take the little fella first,\" he said. \"If he acts up,\nwe'll just leave the other fella the way he is.\"\n\nHe fired at Tom, and the young cadet began to shudder violently. His\nteeth chattered and he found it difficult to focus his eyes as his\nnervous system tried to shake off the effects of the ray. He crumpled to\na heap on the balcony floor and gasped for breath.\n\n\"He won't be much use to you for a while.\" Brett laughed. \"Look at him\nflopping around like a fish out of water.\"\n\n\"Get up!\" snarled Miles at Tom, quickly flipping the ray gun back to\npositive charge. \"Come on. You're not that bad off. Get up.\" He leaned\nover and prodded the cadet with the gun. \"If you don't get up, I'll\nfreeze you again,\" he threatened.\n\nTom struggled to his feet. \"I'll get you for this, Miles,\" he gasped\nweakly, his teeth still chattering.\n\n\"Never mind the hot air!\" snarled Brett. \"Go down there and start\nhauling up those boxes.\"\n\nTom turned helplessly and stumbled down the stairs to the floor of the\ncavern.\n\n\"Now for the big fellow,\" said Miles. He fired the neutralizer charge\nand Astro started to quiver at the shock of the release. But he clamped\nhis teeth together and made a quick lunge for Miles, reaching for the\nspaceman's throat. Expecting the attack, Miles stepped aside quickly and\nbrought the gun down sharply on the big cadet's head. Astro dropped to\nthe floor, half-stunned. The black-clad spaceman leveled the ray gun and\nsneered, \"Try that again, you overgrown punk, and I'll drop you on your\nhead.\"\n\nAstro shook his head and stumbled to his feet. He glared at Miles, spun\naway, and walked down the stairs shakily.\n\nMiles and Brett stood on the balcony and watched the two cadets working\non the cavern floor. \"Hurry it up there!\" shouted Miles. \"We haven't got\nall day.\"\n\nBrett took his ray gun from his belt and stepped forward. \"I'll handle\nCorbett,\" he said. \"You take care of the big one.\"\n\n\"Right,\" replied Miles. \"But stay well in back of them and keep your gun\non them all the time.\"\n\n\"How long do you think it'll take to get the ship loaded?\" asked Brett.\n\n\"Couple of hours. But what are you going to do about Walters if he's\nwise?\" Miles shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Simple,\" said Brett. \"We take the stuff we've got, haul it to the\nhide-out, dump it, and return to Atom City. Then we just sit tight and\nwait until the situation clears up here on Titan.\"\n\n\"What about that investigation?\" asked Miles, keeping his eyes on the\ncadets, who were now staggering back to the stairs, each carrying a\nheavy lead box containing the precious uranium pitchblende.\n\n\"What can an investigation prove?\" snorted Brett.\n\n\"I don't know. Walters and Strong are pretty smart cookies.\"\n\n\"Unless they have witnesses that you were messing around Kit Barnard's\nship, which they don't, and unless they find out about Ross, which they\nwon't, there isn't anything they can do.\"\n\nMiles looked down at the shorter man beside him. \"Ross, eh?\" He laughed.\n\nBrett stared at him and then shrugged. \"I always get mixed up,\" he said.\n\"But you know what I mean.\"\n\n\"Sure, I know.\" Miles turned to watch Astro and Tom start up the stairs\nto the balcony, the lead boxes on their shoulders. \"What are you going\nto do with them?\" he said.\n\n\"Take them to the hide-out and decide later. Besides, they'll be handy\nfor unloading the ship.\"\n\n\"Good idea,\" nodded Miles. He took a deep breath and smiled. \"I sure\nwish I could see Walters' face when he learns about the new load of\nuranium that'll flood the market.\"\n\nBrett laughed. \"Yeah, and with the customs clearance we'll get to haul\nin the crystal, there'll be no way they can figure out how it's getting\nin.\"\n\nMiles turned and shouted at the two cadets struggling up the stairs.\n\"Come on, you two. Get a move on.\"\n\n\"We're making it as fast as we can, Miles,\" Astro protested.\n\n\"It ain't fast enough,\" sneered the spaceman. He reached out with his\nfree hand and slapped Astro across the mouth. \"That's just to remind you\nto watch your tongue, or you might wind up an icicle again.\"\n\nAstro dropped the box and crouched, his big frame ready to be released\nlike a coiled spring. Miles backed up and fingered the trigger on the\nray gun. \"Come on, stupid,\" he snarled. \"Come on, I'll give it to you\nagain, only this time--\" He smiled.\n\n\"No, Astro,\" called Tom. \"There's nothing we can do now. No use getting\nfrozen again.\"\n\n\"That's using your head, Corbett.\" Miles laughed. \"Pick up that box and\nget going.\"\n\nAstro picked up the lead box again and staggered after Tom toward the\ndoor. Miles and Brett stepped back, guns ready, and watched the two\ncadets walk slowly ahead of them into the tunnel.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCaptain Strong and Sergeant Morgan crept to the side of the warehouse\nand flattened themselves against the wall. With the gas swirling around\nthem thicker than ever, they found it more difficult than ever to see\nwhere they were going.\n\n\"I think I see a door ahead,\" said Strong.\n\n\"Want me to see if it'll open, sir?\" asked Morgan.\n\n\"No. I'll look around in the warehouse,\" replied the Solar Guard\ncaptain. \"You investigate the ship. If anyone's aboard, keep him there\nuntil I contact you. If not, come back here and wait for me.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir,\" said Morgan, and turned toward the black ship. In a\nmoment he was lost in the deadly mist.\n\nStrong made his way to the door and twisted the latch. The door slid\nopen easily, and he stepped inside, closing it behind him and waiting\nfor some signs of life or movement. The gas was like a thick fog in the\nroom and he inched his way forward, hands outstretched like a blind\nperson. Gradually he began to see the vague form of a door on the\nopposite wall and he made his way toward it, completely unaware that he\ncame within inches of falling through the open trap door in the floor.\n\nHe opened the door in the wall slowly, peering inside cautiously. He was\nstartled to feel the faint rush of air on his hands and to see the room\nclear of the dangerous methane ammonia gas. He moved quickly inside and\nmade a hurried inspection of the gear, not bothering to look to examine\nit closely. He shrugged his shoulders. It was just as Morgan had said.\nAn abandoned warehouse with old mining gear and nothing else.\n\nSuddenly he stopped. There was something strange about the room and he\nlooked around again. The gas! There were no ammonia vapors in the room.\nHe quickly searched along the walls for some outlet of oxygen,\nremembering now the rush of air he had felt as he opened the door. Close\nto a corner near the door, he found a small opening. Air poured out of\nit in a steady rush. He straightened up, his face grim. \"So that's it,\"\nhe said to himself. \"Somebody has been sucking off oxygen from the main\npumps!\"\n\nStrong headed for the door. \"But why?\" he asked himself. \"Why in this\nparticular building?\"\n\nHe strode out of the room and inched his way across the outer room\ntoward the front door, again narrowly missing the open trap door.\n\nOnce outside, he made his way along the side of the building in the\ndirection that Morgan had taken. When he reached the corner, he could\nsee the black bulk of the _Space Knight_ a hundred yards away. He ran\ntoward the base of the ship and met Morgan coming toward him.\n\n\"Find anything, Sergeant?\" he called.\n\n\"Nothing, sir,\" replied Morgan. \"The ship is ready to blast off and her\ncargo holds are full. But that's all.\"\n\n\"Full of what?\"\n\n\"I couldn't see, sir. The main hatch was locked and I could only see\nthrough the viewport. But it just looked like general cargo to me.\"\n\n\"Couldn't have been crystal?\"\n\n\"It might have been, sir. It was pretty dark in the hold but it looked\nlike a lot of boxes to me.\"\n\n\"You don't put crystal blocks in boxes,\" said Strong.\n\n\"Sometimes they do, sir. The more expensive grades are crated, so that\nthe surfaces won't get scratched. Pieces that are going to be used for\nouter facings on a building, for instance.\"\n\n\"All right, Sergeant. But I found something back in that building that\nis going to prove very interesting.\"\n\n\"The cadets, sir?\"\n\n\"No. An illegal use of oxygen!\"\n\nQuickly Strong explained his discovery, concluding, \"Come on. We're\ngoing back in there for a closer inspection!\"\n\n\"But we can't, sir,\" said Morgan.\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"We only have enough oxygen left in our tanks to get us back to the\ncleared area.\"\n\n\"Blast it!\" growled Strong. \"Aren't there any masks aboard the ship?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" replied Morgan.\n\n\"Very well, then. The only thing we can do is go back and bring out a\nsearching party in force.\" Strong turned and walked rapidly away. \"Come\non, Sergeant, I think we're on the way to answering a lot of questions\nabout the failure of the screens.\"\n\nAlmost running, the two spacemen disappeared into the swirling mist of\ndeadly gases.\n\nNo sooner were they out of sight than Tom Corbett and Astro, faces\ncovered with oxygen masks, emerged from the warehouse and headed toward\nthe ship, Miles and Brett close behind them with paralo-ray guns leveled\nat their backs.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 16\n\n\nRoger Manning opened his eyes, then closed them. He lay perfectly still\nand listened. The sound he heard was the unmistakable blasting roar of a\nspaceship. But there was another sound, much closer. In fact, it was in\nthe room with him.\n\nHe opened one eye to see Quent Miles moving about in the one-room,\nairtight space hut which had been his jail for the last week. Miles was\nthrowing clothes into a space bag, keeping a wary eye on Roger, sprawled\non the bunk. Hoisting the bag to his shoulder, Miles closed the face\nplate of his space helmet, turned to the air lock, and stepped inside,\nslamming the portal behind him. From the bunk, Roger could hear the\nhissing of the change of pressure inside the lock from normal to the\nvacuum of space outside.\n\nThe entire week had been a time of waiting and wondering. He couldn't\nunderstand Miles' actions in taking him prisoner the moment before\nblast-off from Earth, and then keeping him at the asteroid, seemingly\ngiving up all chances of winning the race.\n\nRoger waited until he was sure that the black-clad spaceman had gone,\nthen he sat up and worked desperately on the thin metal chain binding\nhis wrists. He had been working on one of the links ever since his\narrival at Miles' strange asteroid base, scraping it against the rough\nmetal edge of one of the legs of his bunk. Two days before, he had\nsucceeded in wearing it down to a point where he could snap it easily\nwhen the opportunity came for him to make a break. But so far the chance\nhad not presented itself. He had been kept prisoner in the space hut,\nand Miles had pushed his food in through a vent in the air lock. Now,\nhowever, with the sound of the spaceship outside, the cadet decided it\nwas time for action.\n\nWorking quickly, Roger snapped the link and tore off the chain, freeing\nhis hands. He allowed himself the longed-for luxury of stretching just\nonce, and then crossed to the small locker beside the air-lock door to\ntake out a space suit. He climbed into it hurriedly, secured the helmet,\nand began searching the small room for a weapon. In the bottom of a\nchest he found a rocketman's wrench. Grasping it tightly, he stepped\ninto the air lock. Just before he turned on the oxygen in his space\nsuit, he listened again for the noise of the blasting ship. Then he\ngrinned as he realized that it wasn't the noise of the ship he heard,\nbut the vibration it created on the surface of the asteroid. Sound\nwouldn't travel through the vacuum of space outside. Suddenly it stopped\nand Roger realized the tubes were being blasted in preparation for\ntake-off. The young cadet closed the inner portal of the lock, adjusted\nthe pressure, turned on the oxygen of his suit, and waited. In a moment\nthe indicator showed the pressure to be equal to that outside in space,\nand he opened the outer portal cautiously.\n\nA section of the asteroid belt swam above him. Hundreds of small\nplanetoids and various-sized pieces of space junk drifted in the cold\nvacuum of space overhead. Roger looked around. The asteroid he was on\nwas so small and the horizon such a short distance away that the base of\nMiles' giant black ship was half-covered by the curvature of the\nplanetoid.\n\nHolding the wrench tightly in his hand, the blond-haired cadet circled\naround the space hut cautiously, looking for Quent Miles, but the\nspaceman was nowhere in sight. He had walked all the way around the hut\nand back to the air lock when he saw a movement out of the corner of his\neye. It was Miles, returning to the space hut. Moving quickly, Roger\nducked behind a huge boulder and waited for Miles to come closer. It\nwould be impossible to hit Miles with the heavy wrench. The space helmet\nwould ward off the blow. His only chance was to get aboard the ship\nwhile Miles was inside the hut. And he would have to move fast. When\nMiles discovered the hut was empty, he would come looking for the young\ncadet.\n\nBut to the cadet's great relief, Miles went past the hut and disappeared\nover the horizon of the asteroid in the opposite direction.\n\nSlipping out from behind the boulder and utilizing the near lack of\ngravity, Roger ran in giant leaps toward the black spaceship. His last\njump brought him to the base of the ship where he quickly clambered up\nthe ladder, opened the portal, and slipped into the air lock. In a\nmatter of seconds he had built up the pressure in the lock to equal the\npressure inside the ship. He opened the inner portal and raced up the\nladder to the control deck. Throwing himself into the pilot's chair, he\nprepared to raise ship. Then he slumped in despair. The master switch\nhad been removed. It was impossible for him to blast off!\n\nHe leaped out of the chair and scrambled up the ladder to the radar\ndeck. He flipped on the audioceiver and nervously waited for the tubes\nto warm up. Nothing happened. Only then he remembered that the\ncommunications would not work without power from the generators and they\ncould not be started without the master switch.\n\n\"Boy! He sure wasn't taking any chances of me getting away and leaving\nhim here,\" Roger muttered to himself, as he turned back to the ladder\nand climbed down to the air lock. He stepped inside, and crossing to the\nsmall viewport, looked out over the dead landscape of the tiny world for\na sign of Quent Miles. He saw the black-clad spaceman returning toward\nthe hut. Roger held his breath. If Miles went into the hut this time and\nfound him missing, he would know that the cadet was aboard the ship.\n\"Manning,\" Roger said to himself, \"if you ever needed luck, you need it\nnow!\"\n\nMiles walked slowly, as if in no hurry, still heading for the space hut.\nBut as Roger held his breath in fear, he passed it again, without so\nmuch as pausing to look at it.\n\nRoger grinned. \"Spaceman, you are going to say your prayers every night\nafter this,\" he murmured.\n\nThe cadet turned, and racing as fast as the cumbersome space suit would\nallow him, headed toward the power deck. Passing the galley, he snatched\nup several plastic packages of food.\n\nDown on the power deck, Roger went directly to the lead baffling shields\naround the reactant chambers and carefully squeezed between them and the\nouter hull. It was going to be a rough ride on the power deck, jammed in\nbehind the firing chambers, but at least he was hidden--and more\nimportant, _free_.\n\nHe listened for the clank of metal shoes on the ladder above him. When\nhe heard them, followed closely by the slam of the air-lock portal, he\ngrinned in satisfaction. Opening one of the plastic bags, he began to\neat.\n\nIn a moment the ship came to life and the power deck became a raging\ntorrent of noise and vibration. As Roger braced himself, he felt the\nship quiver and then shake, as under heavy acceleration, it blasted off\ninto space.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCaptain Strong and young Sergeant Morgan hailed a passing jet truck\nloaded with Space Marines. \"Get me to Commander Walters right away,\nLieutenant!\" said Strong to the young officer in charge. \"This is an\nemergency.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" acknowledged the young officer, and sent the truck roaring\ndown the empty avenue toward the electronics building where Walters was\nstill checking the reports on the screens.\n\n\"Is there anything new, sir?\" asked the young officer. \"Have the\ntechnicians been able to find out what's making the screens fail?\"\n\n\"We're on the right track, Lieutenant,\" said Strong shortly. \"Can't you\nget any more speed out of this thing?\"\n\n[Illustration: _It would be a rough ride, but at least he was hidden_]\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied the officer. He rammed the accelerator to the floor\nand the small truck blasted through the streets as though shot out of\ncannon.\n\nIn a few minutes the truck screamed to a halt in front of the building\nand Strong leaped toward the door, followed closely by Sergeant Morgan\nand the Space Marine lieutenant.\n\nStrong found Walters before the telemetering board waiting impatiently\nfor some figures Dr. Joan Dale had sent him to be analyzed and\nevaluated. He spun around when Strong entered the room at a dead run.\n\n\"Steve!\" he exclaimed. \"What's the matter? Anything happen to the\ncadets?\"\n\n\"We didn't find them, sir, but we did find something else. We--\" Before\nStrong could finish, the calculator began pouring out its answers.\n\n\"Excuse me, Steve! These figures could tell us why the screens are\nfailing.\"\n\n\"But I know why they're failing, sir!\" shouted Strong.\n\n\"You know what?\" exclaimed Walters.\n\nAs all the men in the room stared at him, Strong hurriedly told the\ncommanding officer what he had found, concluding, \"I think the room I\nstumbled into was used as a repair shop. But it was gas-free and pure\noxygen was coming out of the pipe I described.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Walters grimly. \"Let me check that against these figures.\"\nHe turned to the calculator and with the assistance of Joe Howard, Kit\nBarnard, and the chief electronics engineer began studying the figures.\n\nStrong paced up and down nervously. The faces of the technicians in the\nroom clearly showed the strain they had been under the past few days.\nAnd when they heard the startling news Strong had delivered, there\nwasn't one who didn't feel his fingers tighten into fists at Brett and\nMiles' selfishness.\n\nWalters straightened up and glanced at the faces of the men around him.\n\"Well, gentlemen,\" he said. \"I think the figures speak for themselves.\"\n\nThere was a murmur of agreement. Walters turned back to Strong. \"Those\nfigures prove conclusively that what you say is true. It is impossible\nfor the screens to collapse except from a vital leak--exactly such a\nleak as you have described.\"\n\nWalters turned and began to snap orders to the men around him. \"I want\nevery available man sent out on the double. I want every inch of that\narea searched for an opening to a mine shaft or anything that leads\nunderground. Take half the men off the spaceport detail.\"\n\n\"Shall we continue evacuation operations for the miners and their\nfamilies?\" asked the young Space Marine lieutenant. \"There is quite a\nforce of men out there that could be used in the search.\"\n\n\"What do you think, Steve? Should we take off the guardsmen and suspend\nevacuation in the hope that we can find that leak?\"\n\n\"I would say yes, Commander,\" said Strong. \"Your figures and those Dr.\nDale sent you point to a leak of this nature.\"\n\n\"Very well, Lieutenant,\" said Walters. \"Order every man to the area and\nbegin search operations immediately. I want that leak found--and found\nfast! And I want Charles Brett and Quent Miles arrested at once!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTom and Astro bent over the lead boxes again and heaved them to their\nshoulders. A quick glance showed them that Miles had not followed them\nto the floor of the cavern as he had done before, but had remained on\nguard on the balcony.\n\nAs they struggled to lift the boxes to their shoulders, Tom whispered\nout of the side of his mouth, \"I know how we can get out of here,\nAstro.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"Since Brett is staying on the ship for this trip, Miles is going to\nhave trouble watching both of us.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I know,\" muttered Astro. \"Want me to jump him?\"\n\n\"No,\" Tom growled. \"Miles has been trailing us through the tunnel by\ntwenty to thirty feet each trip. When we pass that spot where the light\nis, you drop your box. He'll be watching you then and that will give me\na chance to grab that booby trap you took apart, remember?\"\n\n\"Yeah!\"\n\n\"O.K. Now remember, when I give you the word, you drop your box on the\nright-hand side of the tunnel.\"\n\n\"Hurry up down there!\" yelled Miles from the balcony. \"We haven't got\nall night.\"\n\n\"Keep your shirt on, buster,\" growled Astro. \"We're tired.\"\n\nThe two cadets balanced the heavy lead boxes on their shoulders, and,\nwith Tom leading the way, climbed up the stairs past Miles and started\nup the tunnel in front of the black-suited spaceman.\n\nThey walked slowly, side by side, and as before, Miles stayed a good\ntwenty paces behind them. As they neared the light where they knew the\nexplosive charge would be, Tom began slowing his pace.\n\n\"Come on, get going, Corbett!\" Miles yelled.\n\n\"He's tired,\" said Astro. \"Leave him alone.\"\n\n\"What are you, his protector?\" snarled Miles. \"Get going, I said.\"\n\n\"O.K.,\" said Tom, struggling forward.\n\nThey came closer and closer to the light. Tom glanced at Astro and\nwinked. Astro winked back and braced himself to fake the accident.\n\nAs closely as Tom could remember, Astro had tossed the charge to one\nside about ten feet beyond the light. If he knew exactly where it was,\nhe could fall forward on top of it and stuff it in his tunic. He tried\nto recreate the scene as it happened. They passed under the light. One\nstep ... two steps ... three steps.... \"Now, Astro,\" Tom whispered.\n\nThe big cadet lunged to one side, dropping the heavy box to the floor.\nAt the same time, Tom dropped his box and lunged forward, arms\noutstretched, feeling along the floor for the precious explosives.\n\nMiles ran up quickly, ray gun cocked and ready.\n\n\"Get up!\" he shouted. \"Get up or I'll freeze you both and leave you\nhere!\"\n\nTom and Astro struggled to their feet. They lifted the heavy boxes to\ntheir shoulders and started down the tunnel again.\n\nWhen Astro dared a glance at Tom, he saw his unit mate grin and wink at\nhim. Astro winked back. Suddenly it seemed that the heavy lead box was\nas light as air!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 17\n\n\nThe streets of Olympia echoed to the thunderous roar of jet trucks and\njet cars racing to sector twelve. Miners, Solar Guardsmen, and Space\nMarines jammed the vehicles, their faces grim with determination as they\nprepared for an all-out attempt to prevent the death of the colony.\n\nWalters, Strong, and Kit Barnard sat behind Blake, the Space Marine\nlieutenant, and Sergeant Morgan as they rocketed through the streets.\nThere was little conversation, each man thinking bitterly of Charles\nBrett and Quent Miles. Walters had already foreseen the possibility of\ntrouble with emotional miners and had ordered Blake to be personally\nresponsible for the safety of Miles and Brett when they were arrested.\n\n\"They get a fair trial like anyone else,\" declared Walters. \"And they\nare innocent until proven guilty by a jury.\"\n\nNow, as he sat beside Strong, Walters wondered if they would be able to\nsave the city from the ammonia gas. He had taken a calculated risk in\nordering guardsmen at the spaceport to aid in this search. If they\nshould fail to find the leak, and the gas death spread farther across\nthe city, the miners and their families would be helpless before it. The\nthought of the riots that would ensue if the people tried to get aboard\nthe spaceships without order made the hardened commander shudder.\n\nThe jet car slowed and finally stopped. \"What's the matter?\" growled\nWalters.\n\n\"This is as far as we can go in the car, sir,\" replied Blake. \"The gas\nis so thick I can't see where I'm driving.\"\n\n\"Very well. Put on your masks,\" Walters announced. \"Keep in contact with\nthe spaceport control tower. They'll relay messages to me and my orders\nback to you. Let's go. Spaceman's luck.\"\n\nThe men opened the doors of the small jet car and stepped out into the\nswirling mists. Though there were more than a thousand men searching the\narea, they could not rid themselves of a strange feeling of loneliness\nas they each walked forward into the mists of death.\n\nStrong and Walters inched their way down the street like blind men,\nfeeling for each step with hesitant feet.\n\n\"Are you sure we're heading in the right direction, Steve?\" asked\nWalters.\n\n\"Yes, Commander,\" replied Strong. \"The warehouse is located about a half\nmile down this street.\"\n\n\"Of all the blasted messes,\" grumbled Walters. \"We've got the finest\nradar system in the universe and we have to walk along here feeling our\nway like blind men.\"\n\n\"There's no other way, I'm afraid,\" said Strong grimly.\n\n\"Are you still with us, Kit?\" called Walters.\n\n\"Right here, sir,\" came Barnard's voice, immediately behind them.\n\nThe spacemen continued their slow march through the mist in silence.\nOnce, when Walters stumbled and nearly fell, he roared angrily.\n\n\"By the craters of Luna, when I get my hands on those two space\ncrawlers, there won't be enough of them left for a trial!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Steve. \"But if anything has happened to those cadets,\nyou'll have to excuse ranks, sir, and wait your turn.\"\n\n\"Of course!\" Walters exclaimed a moment later. \"That's what happened to\nManning! He didn't run away. He must have gotten on to them during the\ntrip out here and they shut him up.\"\n\n\"Exactly what I was thinking, sir,\" said Strong, and then suddenly\nstopped. \"I just bumped into a wall. We're here.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTom and Astro climbed wearily through the trap door into the room above\nthe main shaft while Quent Miles watched them closely, keeping his\nparalo-ray gun leveled. The two boys hitched the heavy lead boxes into a\nmore comfortable position on their shoulders and started toward the door\nleading outside. But neither boy thought of his discomfort or weariness\nnow. With the explosive charge safely hidden under Tom's blouse, they\nhad a chance to fight back. It was a small chance, perhaps, but at least\na chance.\n\nOutside, they walked slowly through the swirling methane ammonia and Tom\nedged closer to his unit mate.\n\n\"Can you hear me, Astro?\" he whispered through the mask amplifier. The\nbig cadet simply nodded, keeping his eyes forward.\n\n\"We'll have to bluff our way now,\" continued Tom in a low whisper. \"This\nstuff has to be set off with a charge of electricity.\"\n\n\"Where do we get it?\" mumbled Astro.\n\n\"The paralo-ray gun.\"\n\n\"You're space happy. It won't work.\"\n\n\"I know that,\" hissed Tom. \"But maybe Miles doesn't. I'll challenge\nMiles, hold the stuff right in front of me, and warn him that if he\nfires he'll set off the explosive and blow the four of us up.\"\n\n\"Oh, brother. That's a bluff to end all bluffs! Suppose he doesn't\nbite?\"\n\n\"Then get set to take another paralo-ray charge.\"\n\n\"O.K.,\" sighed Astro. \"When do you want to try it?\"\n\n\"I'll give you the word,\" replied Tom. \"Just be ready.\" The cadet turned\naway quickly. \"Watch it,\" he hissed. \"He's suspicious.\"\n\nThe two boys plodded along across the field as Miles moved up closer. He\nstared at them for a long moment and then continued to walk along\ndirectly behind them.\n\nWhen they reached the ship, Miles allowed them to rest and catch their\nbreath before making the long climb up the ladder to the air-lock\nportal. Brett suddenly appeared in the open portal above them.\n\n\"Hey, Miles,\" he called, \"is that the last of it?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Miles called back. \"You get in touch with our pal?\"\n\n\"Uh-huh. He's going to meet us out in space.\"\n\n\"In space?\" Miles stared up at Brett with a strange gleam in his eye.\n\"Why not the hide-out?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Brett replied from above. \"Let's not waste time talking\nnow. Get those other two cases up here. I want to blast off.\"\n\nMiles turned to the two cadets and waved his paralo-ray gun menacingly.\n\"All right, you two. Get going!\"\n\n\"Give us a few more minutes, Miles,\" said Tom. \"We're so tired we can\nhardly move.\"\n\n\"Get up, I said,\" snarled the black-suited spaceman.\n\n\"I can't,\" whined Tom. \"You'll have to give me a hand.\"\n\nMiles pointed his gun straight at the young cadet. \"All right. That\nmeans the big fella makes two trips and I freeze you right now.\"\n\n\"No, no!\" cried Tom, jumping to his feet. \"I can make it. Please don't\nfreeze me again.\" Astro turned away to hide his smile.\n\nSneering his disgust at Tom's apparent fear, Miles prodded the cadets up\nthe ladder. Tom went first, the heavy box digging into his shoulder.\nAstro followed, cursing the fog that prevented him from seeing where\nMiles stood below him so he could drop the heavy box on him.\n\nAbove them, Charles Brett watched them emerge out of the ammonia mist,\nray gun held tightly in his hand. Tom climbed into the air lock safely\nand dropped the box on the edge of the platform, slumping to the deck\nbeside it. Astro followed seconds later, and then Miles.\n\n\"Don't stop now,\" barked Miles. \"Put those boxes below with the rest of\nthem.\"\n\nTom got up slowly, leaning heavily on the outer edge of the\nprecariously placed box. The box suddenly tilted and then slipped out of\nthe air lock to disappear in the mist.\n\n\"Why, you clumsy--\" Brett roared, raising his gun menacingly.\n\nAstro stepped in front of Tom. \"I'll get it,\" he cried. \"Don't shoot!\"\n\n\"Go on then,\" snarled Brett. \"Go down with him, Miles. I'll stay here\nwith Corbett.\"\n\n\"You go down with him,\" sneered Miles. \"I've been up and down that\nladder fifty times while you sat up here doing nothing.\"\n\n\"Is that so?\" cried Brett angrily, turning to face the black-clad\nspaceman. This gave Tom the opportunity he was waiting for. He pulled\nthe small charge of explosives from his tunic and held it in front of\nhim.\n\n\"All right, you two!\" he shouted. \"Drop those paralo-ray guns. This is\nthe booby trap you planted in the tunnel. You fire those ray guns and we\nall go up together.\"\n\nBrett jumped back. Miles took a half step forward and stopped. \"You\nhaven't got the nerve,\" he sneered.\n\n\"Shoot and you'll find out,\" said Tom. \"Go ahead! Shoot, if you've got\nthe guts. Get down the ladder, Astro,\" he said. \"They won't fire as long\nas I've got this in my hand.\"\n\nBrett had begun to shake with fear but Miles brought his ray gun up\nslowly. He aimed it at Astro who was starting down the ladder, his head\nand shoulders still showing in the open air-lock portal. Tom saw what\nMiles was going to do. \"Jump, Astro!\" he shouted.\n\nAstro jumped at the exact instant Miles fired. \"Rush him,\" cried Miles.\nBrett made a headlong dash for Tom, but the cadet side-stepped at the\nlast moment and Brett fell headlong out of the ship, wailing in sudden\nterror as he fell to the ground.\n\nMiles turned to Tom. He ripped off his mask and with his free hand\nclosed the air-lock portal.\n\n\"You fooled Brett, but you didn't fool me, Corbett.\" He laughed. \"It\ntakes a direct electric charge to set that stuff off. You just helped me\nget rid of a very obnoxious partner.\" He leveled his paralo-ray gun.\n\n\"I hate to do this,\" he said, \"but it's you or me.\"\n\nHe fired. Tom was again frozen into that immobile state more dead than\nalive. Miles laughed and hurried to the control deck.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAstro got up on his knees slowly. Though the fall had been a hard one,\nhe had rolled quickly with the first impact, thus preventing any\ninjuries. He shook his head, regained his sense of direction, and then\nrose to his feet, starting back to the ship in hope of helping Tom. He\ntripped over something and fell to the ground. Groping around in the\nthickening ammonia gas he felt the still form of a body. For a moment,\nthinking it was Tom, his heart nearly stopped, and then he breathed a\nsilent prayer of thankfulness when he recognized Charley Brett. He felt\nthe man's heart. There was a faint beat.\n\nAstro opened the valve on Brett's oxygen mask wide and waited until the\nman was breathing normally. Then he began feeling his way back to the\nladder. Suddenly he heard a sound that made his blood run cold. It was\nthe unmistakable whine of the cooling pumps building for blast-off. And\nhe was directly underneath the exhaust tubes.\n\nHe scrambled away, heading back to the spot where Brett lay. The whining\nof the pumps built to an agonizing scream. There were scant seconds left\nto save himself. He could not wait to find Brett. He began running\nwildly away from the ship, stumbling, failing, rising to his feet again\nto plunge on, away from the deadly white-hot exhaust blast of the _Space\nKnight_.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThere was a terrific explosion, and then Astro was lifted off his feet\nand hurled through the mist, head over heels. He screamed and then\nblacked out.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"We found him about a thousand yards away from the warehouse,\nCommander,\" said the guardsman. \"He looks pretty beat and his clothes\nare burned a little. I think he must have been caught in the blast of\nthat ship we heard take off.\"\n\nWalters looked down at Astro's big frame, sprawled on the ground, and\nthen at the medical corpsman who was giving him a quick examination. The\ncorpsman straightened up and turned to Walters and Captain Strong.\n\"He'll be all right as soon as he wakes up.\"\n\n\"Shock?\" asked Strong.\n\n\"Yes. And complete fatigue. Look at his hands and knees. He's been doing\nsome pretty rough work.\" The corpsman indicated the big cadet's hands,\nskinned and swollen from his labor in the mines.\n\n\"Wake him up!\" growled Walters.\n\n\"Wake him up!\" exclaimed the corpsman. \"Why, sir, I couldn't allow--\"\n\n\"Wake him up. And that's an order!\" insisted Walters.\n\n\"Very well, sir. But this will have to go into my report to the senior\nmedical officer.\"\n\n\"And I'll commend you for insisting on proper care for your patients,\"\nWalters stated. \"But in the meantime we've got to find out what\nhappened. And Cadet Astro is the only one who can tell us.\"\n\nThe corpsman turned to his emergency kit. He took out a large hypodermic\nneedle, filled with a clear fluid, and injected it into the big cadet's\narm.\n\nIn less than a minute Astro was sitting up and telling Walters\neverything that had happened. When he told of the pipe that was sucking\noff the oxygen from the main pumps, Walters dispatched an emergency crew\nto the mine immediately to plug the leak. Then, when Astro revealed the\nsecret of the mine, the presence of the uranium pitchblende, Walters\nshook his head slowly.\n\n\"Amazing!\" he exclaimed. \"Greed can ruin a man. He could have declared\nsuch a discovery and still had more money than he could have spent in a\nlifetime.\"\n\nWalters spun around. \"Steve, I want the _Polaris_ ready to blast off\nwithin an hour. We're going after one of the dirtiest space rats that\never hit the deep!\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 18\n\n\nRoger peered around the edge of the baffling shields. The power deck was\nempty. He edged out and stood upright, eyes moving constantly for signs\nof Miles.\n\nNo longer needing the cumbersome space suit, he stripped it off and\nwalked across the deck to the ladder. He stopped to listen again but\nthere was only the sound of the rockets under emergency space drive. A\nquick glance at the control panel told him that the ship was hurtling\nthrough space at a fantastic speed. Satisfied that Miles was nowhere\nnear, Roger gripped the rocketman's wrench tightly and began climbing\nslowly and cautiously.\n\nWhen he reached the next deck, he raised his head through the hatch\nslowly. Then, in one quick movement, he pulled himself up on the deck\nand ran for cover behind a small locker to his right. Above him, through\nthe open network of frames and girders, he could see the control deck,\nbut Miles was nowhere in sight.\n\nSomething on the opposite side of the ship caught his eye. Miles' space\nsuit hung on its rack, the heavy fish-bowllike space helmet beside it in\nits open locker. Roger's heart skipped a beat as he noticed the holster\nfor a paralo-ray gun nearby. But the large flap was closed and he could\nnot see if it held a gun.\n\n[Illustration: _Slowly and cautiously he began climbing_]\n\nThe young cadet moved away from the protection of the locker and started\ntoward the space suit. He moved slowly, watching the upper deck where he\nfigured Miles would be at the control board, operating the ship.\n\nSuddenly Miles appeared above him, walking across the open control deck\nwith a clip board in his hand, making a standard check of the many\ninstruments. Before Roger could find a hiding place, Miles saw the\ncadet. He drew his paralo-ray gun quickly, firing with the speed of a\npracticed hand. Roger dove toward the space suit and wrenched open the\nholster but found it empty. Miles was behind him now, running down the\nladder.\n\nRoger spun around, darted to the ladder leading to the power deck, and\njust missed being hit by Miles' second shot. He jumped the ten feet to\nthe power deck and darted behind the huge bank of atomic motors.\n\nMiles came down the ladder slowly, gun leveled, eyes searching the deck.\nHe stopped with his back to the rocket motors and called, \"All right,\nManning, come on out. If you come out without any trouble, I won't\nfreeze you. I'll just tie you up again.\"\n\nRoger was silent, gripping the wrench tightly and praying for a chance\nto strike. Miles still remained in one position, protected by the motor\nhousing.\n\n\"I'm going to count five, Manning!\" he shouted. \"Then I'll hunt you down\nand freeze you solid.\"\n\nGripping the wrench tightly and raising it above his head, Roger eased\nout from his hiding place and slipped across the floor lightly. He was\nwithin four feet of Miles when the black-suited spaceman spun around\nand stepped back quickly. \"Sucker,\" he snarled, and fired.\n\nRoger stood motionless, his arm still raised, the wrench falling to the\ndeck. Miles stuck his face close to Roger's head and said, \"I don't know\nhow you got here, but it doesn't make any difference now. In a little\nwhile you and your pal, Corbett, are going for a swim out in space.\"\n\nHolding Roger by the arm, he tipped the boy over and lowered him to the\ndeck. Roger's arm stuck up like the branch of a tree. Miles stood over\nhim, flipped on the neutralizer charge of the gun, and fired again,\nreleasing Roger from the paralyzing effect of the ray.\n\nThe young cadet began to shake violently and through his chattering\nteeth he muttered a space oath. Miles only grinned.\n\n\"Just wanted you to make yourself comfortable, Manning,\" he said. He\nflipped the gun to direct charge again and pointed it at the boy. Seeing\nit was useless to try and jump the burly spaceman, Roger relaxed and\nstretched out on the deck. Miles fired again calmly, and after testing\nthe effect of the ray with his toe, he turned to the ladder.\n\nAs the spaceman climbed back to the control deck, Roger, though in a\nparalyzed state, could hear the communicator loud-speaker paging Miles.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Come in, Quent! This is Ross! Come in!\"\n\nTom Corbett sat bound and gagged in the copilot's chair of the black\nship, listening to Miles call again and again over the audioceiver. The\nfact that Miles was identifying himself as Ross puzzled the young cadet\nand he wondered if it was an alias. Tom was even more puzzled when\nMiles addressed the person he was calling as Quent.\n\n\"This is Ross! Acknowledge, Quent! Come in!\"\n\nStatic spluttered over the loud-speaker and then a clear, harsh voice\nthat was a perfect imitation, answered, \"I read you, Ross,\" it said.\n\"Where are you?\"\n\nTom watched as Miles made a hasty check on the astrogation chart. \"Space\nquadrant four,\" he replied. \"Chart C for Charley! Where are you?\"\n\n\"Same space quadrant, but on chart B for Baker,\" came the reply. \"I\nthink we can make visual contact on radar in above five minutes. Make\nthe usual radar signal for identification. O.K.?\"\n\n\"Good!\" the _Space Knight_ pilot replied. \"What course are you on?\"\n\nThere was a pause and then the voice answered, \"South southwest. Speed,\nemergency maximum.\"\n\n\"Very well. I will adjust course to meet you. But what's the hurry?\"\nasked Tom's captor.\n\n\"Better get out of space as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I guess you're right.\"\n\nTom listened intently. He closed his eyes and tried to visualize the\ncharts and space quadrants he had heard mentioned. He knew the quadrants\nby heart, and knew that he was close to the asteroid belt. But each\nquadrant had at least a dozen or more charts, each one taking in a huge\narea of space.\n\n\"Is Brett with you?\" asked the voice over the audioceiver.\n\n\"No. I'll tell you about it when we get together. All the rockets in\nspace broke loose up there on Titan for a while.\"\n\n\"What do you mean? Hey! I think I just picked you up on my radar!\" said\nthe voice over the loud-speaker. \"Give me the identification signal.\"\n\nTom watched Miles go to the radarscope and make a minute adjustment. The\nvoice came over the loud-speaker again. \"That's you, all right. Cut back\nto minimum speed and I'll maneuver to your space lock.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" replied the spaceman on the _Space Knight_.\n\nHe cut the rockets and in a matter of minutes the ship was bumped\nheavily as contact was made. The voice over the communicator announced\nthe two space vessels had been coupled. \"Open your air lock and come\naboard.\"\n\n\"You come aboard my ship,\" said Miles. \"We've got the stuff here.\"\n\n\"O.K. But I have to go below and wake up that jerk, Manning.\"\n\n\"Wake him up?\"\n\n\"Yeah. I got him frozen.\"\n\n\"All right, make it snappy.\"\n\nMiles turned to look at Tom, a sneer on his face. \"I'm giving you a\nbreak, Corbett,\" he said. \"You're going to swim with your cadet buddy.\nYou'll have company!\"\n\nGagged, Tom could only glare his hatred at the black-suited spaceman. In\na moment he heard the air lock open below and then footsteps clattered\nup the ladder to the control deck.\n\nThe hatch opened and Roger stumbled inside. He saw Tom immediately and\nyelled, \"Tom! What are--\" Suddenly he stopped. He looked at the man\nstanding beside Tom and gasped in astonishment.\n\nTom watched the hatch as Roger's captor stepped inside. What he saw made\nhim twist around in his chair and stare at the man beside him, utterly\nbewildered.\n\n\"_Twins!_\" cried Roger. \"Identical twins.\"\n\nThe man stepped through the hatch and walked over to his brother. They\nshook hands and slapped each other on the back.\n\n\"What happened to Charley, Ross?\" asked Quent Miles.\n\n\"Just a minute, Quent,\" replied his brother. He turned and grinned at\nTom and Roger. \"Surprised, huh? Don't let it bother you. We've been\ndriving people crazy ever since we were born. Does this tell you how we\nwon the race?\"\n\n\"T-t-twin pilots,\" stuttered Tom in amazement. \"And twin ships?\"\n\n\"Exactly.\" Ross laughed. \"Pretty smart, eh?\"\n\n\"Never mind them now,\" snarled Quent. \"I've been sitting up there on\nthat asteroid rock talking to myself. What happened to Charley?\"\n\n\"Take it easy, will you, Quent?\" said Ross. \"I want to have some fun.\"\nHe turned to Manning. \"Untie Corbett and get on the other side of the\ndeck. Have yourselves a nice long talk before you take your last walk.\"\n\nRoger slowly bent over to untie Tom, muttering a space oath under his\nbreath. The two brothers retired to the opposite side of the control\ndeck and sat down. Ross kept his paralo-ray pistol in his hand and never\nonce took his eyes off the two cadets.\n\n\"Well, what happened?\" demanded Quent. \"What are you doing here with\nCorbett and where in the blazes is Charley?\"\n\n\"Charley is back on Titan, and probably dead,\" replied Ross easily. \"He\nwouldn't pay any attention to us when we suggested plugging up the old\ntunnels when we started mining that uranium, so the oxygen which we were\nsucking off from the main screen supply took too much. The screens\nstarted to go. Practically the whole city is flooded with ammonia gas\nand it's being abandoned.\"\n\nRoger and Tom stood quietly, listening, and when Roger heard the news he\nturned to Tom with a questioning look on his face. Tom merely nodded\ngrimly.\n\n\"But what are you doing here with this load of pitchblende?\" Quent\npersisted.\n\n\"Everything would have been all right, even with the screens letting\ngo,\" explained Ross, \"if it hadn't been for Corbett and that big jerk\nAstro. They followed me out to the warehouse and down into the mine.\nGood thing we caught them, or we'd be on our way to a prison asteroid\nright now.\"\n\nQuent glared over at Tom. \"And Charley spilled the beans about the whole\nthing, eh?\"\n\n\"Not exactly, but the Solar Guard knows enough to be suspicious,\"\nreplied Ross. \"We had some trouble with the radiation-detection gear and\nwanted to haul it out to the hide-out for Manning to check. We decided\nto bring out as much of the stuff as we had mined, and when we caught\nCorbett and Astro snooping around, we made them load the ship. Corbett,\nhere, got smart and Astro escaped. In the fight, Charley fell out of the\nship. I don't know if he got away or not.\"\n\n\"Do we have a whole shipload of the stuff?\" asked Quent.\n\nRoss grinned. \"About two million credits' worth.\"\n\nQuent rubbed his hands together. \"We're in clover.\" He laughed and\nslapped his brother on the back. \"Well, I suppose the Solar Guard is\nlooking for us by now?\"\n\nRoss grinned. \"Right. So we pull the old trick, eh? We have two very\nlikely prospects right there.\" He pointed to Roger and Tom.\n\n\"What is that supposed to mean?\" snapped Roger.\n\n\"You'll find out, squirt,\" sneered Quent Miles.\n\n\"Wait a minute, Quent,\" said Ross. \"I just thought of something. No one\nknows there are two of us, except these two punks here. We can't work\nthe old gag. We can only use one of them.\"\n\n\"How do you mean?\"\n\n\"Simple. The Solar Guard thinks Manning took it on the lam from\nGanymede, right?\"\n\nQuent nodded.\n\n\"Well, we take Manning, dress him up in one of our outfits and stick him\naboard the empty ship alongside. The ship blows up, and should they find\nanything of Manning, he'll be dressed like you, or me, and that will end\nthe situation right there. Later, we can dump Corbett out in a space\nsuit with a little oxygen, and write a note, sticking it in his glove.\nWhen they find him, they'll think he got away from Quent Miles, and when\nhis oxygen gave out, wrote the note giving all the details. And who can\nsay No, since Quent Miles, as such, will be dead?\"\n\n\"End to the affair!\" shouted Quent. \"That's perfect.\"\n\nThe audioceiver behind them crackled into life, and there was a clear,\npiercing signal, a sign that an emergency transmission was taking over\nall channels. The signal continued until the clear, strong voice of\nCommander Walters flooded the control deck of the ship.\n\n\"Attention! Attention! This is Commander Walters of the Solar Guard!\nAttention all Solar Guard units in space quadrants one through\nseven--repeat, all ships in quadrants one through seven. This is\nemergency alert for the rocket ship _Space Knight_, believed to be\nheading for the asteroid belt. All ships are to institute an immediate\nsearch of quadrants one through seven for the _Space Knight_ and arrest\nany and all persons aboard. Repeat. All ships....\"\n\nRoss Miles rose up and snapped off the audioceiver. \"Come on. We've got\nto get out of here!\"\n\n\"What about them?\" asked Quent, pointing to Roger and Tom. \"Will we have\ntime to--?\"\n\n\"Plenty of time,\" said Ross coldly. \"Blast 'em now.\"\n\n\"With pleasure,\" replied Quent Miles, taking his gun from his holster.\n\n\"Jump, Roger!\" shouted Tom.\n\nBoth boys threw themselves sideways as Miles leveled his gun.\n\nTom plunged headlong through the hatch door and scrambled down the\nladder. Roger tried to follow, but Quent fired as Roger started to jump\nfeet first through the hatch. His body became rigid as he tumbled\nthrough the hatch. Tom looked up just in time to break his unit mate's\nfall, but seeing that it would be useless to stay with him, left him on\nthe deck and turned to flee through the depths of the black ship.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 19\n\n\n\"Never mind, Manning!\" shouted Quent Miles as he jumped past Roger's\nbody. \"We've got to find Corbett. Take the starboard ladder; I'll take\nthe port. Search all the way aft to the exhaust tubes if you have to!\"\n\nRoss nodded quickly, hefted his ray gun, and moved down the opposite\nladder.\n\nTom watched both of them come down like twin devils, hands holding the\nray guns as steady as rocks. The cadet hid behind the open door leading\nto the lower cargo holds. Ross was the nearer of the two, walking like a\ncat, slowly, ready to spring or fire at the slightest movement. Tom\nquickly saw that if he jumped Ross, Quent would be on him in seconds.\nHis only chance lay in their passing him, giving him the opportunity to\nreturn to the control deck and search for a ray gun for himself. And if\nthat failed, at least he could call Commander Walters.\n\nRoss crept closer. Tom crouched tensely. Should Ross see him, Tom would\nhave to make an attempt to knock him out and get the ray gun before\nQuent could do anything.\n\n\"Careful, Quent!\" called Ross as he moved toward the open hatch.\n\n\"You too,\" replied his brother. \"This kid is plenty smart.\"\n\nTom breathed a silent prayer. Ross was now opposite the door. Should the\nblack-suited spaceman decide to look behind it, Tom would be at his\nmercy.\n\nRoss stopped beside the door and hesitated a moment.\n\n\"Hey, Ross!\" Quent called, and Ross turned away from the door. \"I think\nI hear something down inside the hold. Slip down the ladder a little way\nand cover me. I'll go down inside and look around. He must be down here\nsomewhere, and if you guard the door, he can't get out.\"\n\nRoss grinned. \"Like flushing quail in Venus jungles,\" he said, moving\naway from the door and down into the hold where the lead boxes filled\nwith uranium pitchblende were stored.\n\nTom could scarcely suppress a loud sigh of relief at his narrow escape.\nAfter a moment he peered cautiously around the edge of the door, and\nseeing the way clear to the control deck, ran back to the ladder. He\npaused at Roger's inert form and bent over, his lips close to the\nparalyzed cadet's ear.\n\n\"I'm going to try and find a ray gun,\" he whispered quickly. \"If I\ncan't, then I'm going to try and get in touch with Commander Walters or\nthe Solar Guard patrols.\"\n\nHe patted the blond-haired cadet on the shoulder and raced up the\nladder to the control deck. Once inside, he barred the door to the rest\nof the ship and began a frantic search of the many lockers and drawers.\nBut it was fruitless. He could find no ray gun or weapon of any kind.\nDesperate, knowing that Ross and Quent would return to the control deck\nwhen they had searched the rest of the ship, Tom turned and scrambled up\nthe ladder to the radar deck.\n\nAgain, barring the door behind him, he sat before the audioceiver and\nbegan calling the _Polaris_.\n\n\"This is Cadet Corbett aboard rocket ship _Space Knight_ in quadrant\nfour, chart C for Charley. Corbett aboard spaceship _Space Knight_ in\nquadrant four, chart C for Charley! Come in, Commander Walters! Come\nin!\"\n\nTom spun the dials on the audioceiver desperately, ranging over every\ncircuit and repeating his cry. \"This is Cadet Corbett! I am being held\nprisoner with Cadet Roger Manning aboard the spaceship _Space Knight_ in\nspace quadrant four, chart C for Charley....\"\n\nSuddenly the hum of the generators stopped and the glow of the tubes in\nthe audioceiver died. Without a second's hesitation, Tom spun around and\nlunged for the door leading back to the control deck.\n\n\"They must have shut off the power,\" he decided. \"When they didn't find\nme down below, they guessed that I came this way.\"\n\nHe raced through the control deck and down the ladder to the starboard\ncompanionway. If he could only get to the ship alongside!\n\nHe chided himself for not thinking of it before and darted toward the\nair lock that coupled the two ships together in space.\n\nHe turned a corner in the companionway and saw the door to the coupling\nchamber ahead. It was open. He dashed inside.\n\n\"Greetings, Corbett!\" sneered Ross Miles. He stood just inside the\ndoorway, the ray gun leveled at Tom.\n\n\"We figured you'd get around to thinking about the other ship sooner or\nlater,\" said Quent behind him, jamming the ray gun in his back. \"So we\njust came here and waited for you.\"\n\n\"Go get the other one, Quent,\" said Ross. Jerking Tom sideways into the\ncoupling chamber, he rammed his gun into the curly-haired cadet's\nstomach. \"I'll get this guy fixed aboard the other ship, and then set\nthe firing chambers so they'll blow up.\"\n\n\"What are we going to do with Manning?\" asked Quent.\n\n\"We'll figure that out later. Hurry up! Corbett probably called the\nSolar Guard.\"\n\n\"That's right, I did, Miles,\" said Tom. \"They're probably closing in on\nyou right now.\"\n\n\"Is that so?\" snarled Quent. \"Well, it's too bad you won't be alive to\nsay hello to them.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I want every pound of thrust you have on that power deck, Astro,\"\nroared Commander Walters into the intercom. \"We just received word from\na freighter that picked up an S O S from Tom aboard the _Space Knight_.\"\n\nSteve Strong and Kit Barnard sat in the pilot and copilot's chairs on\nthe control deck of the _Polaris_ and watched the needle of the\naccelerometer climb as Astro poured on the power in answer to Walters'\ncommand.\n\n\"If I know Astro,\" said Strong, \"you'll probably get the fastest ride\nyou've ever had short of hyperdrive, Kit.\"\n\nKit Barnard gulped as he watched the needle. \"I see what you mean,\" he\nsaid.\n\nWalters strode up and down the deck behind the two veteran spacemen, a\nscowl on his face. \"By the stars,\" he rumbled, \"this is the most\nincredible thing I've run up against in all my years in space!\"\n\nHe paced up and down several times silently. \"To think that two men\ncould--_would_--jeopardize the safety and lives of thousands of people\nfor--a--a uranium mine! It's beyond my comprehension.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, sir,\" said Sid, Kit Barnard's young assistant, coming down\nthe radar-bridge ladder. \"This report just came in from Titan spaceport\ncontrol.\"\n\nWalters took the message and read it quickly. He grunted and handed it\nto Strong. \"They've found the mine and the leak,\" he said. \"The screens\nare working again.\"\n\n\"Then you'll call off the evacuation operations, sir?\" asked Strong.\n\n\"Right.\" Walters turned to Sid. \"Son, send a message back to Titan\ncontrol and tell Captain Howard to stop all evacuations as soon as he\nhas enough oxygen to provide for the citizens of Titan. And then stand\nby for a general order to all units in this area.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Sid, climbing back up to the radar bridge quickly.\n\nThe three men on the control deck fell silent as the ship hurtled\nthrough space. Each of them prayed silently for Tom and Roger's safety.\n\nOn the power deck below, Astro opened every valve and adjusted the\nfiring chambers to their emergency maximum, forcing the giant ship\nfaster and faster through space. And when he had done all he could, he\npaced up and down the deck, snapping a greasy wiping rag against his\nthigh again and again. His face showed the concern he felt for Tom and\nRoger, and at the same time, there was a questioning look in his eye.\nThe auxiliary loud-speaker of the audioceiver overhead spluttered with\nstatic. He stopped to listen.\n\n\"This is Lieutenant Frazer aboard the Solar Guard cruiser _Hydra_ to\nCommander Walters!\" crackled an unfamiliar voice. \"Come in, Commander\nWalters!\"\n\nAstro stared at the loud-speaker and held his breath.\n\n\"This is Walters on the _Polaris_. Go ahead, Frazer!\"\n\n\"I am in command of a squadron of ships on space maneuvers in quadrant\nfive, sir. Shall I abandon my orders and proceed under your general\nemergency alert to search quadrant four?\"\n\n\"How many ships do you have with you, Lieutenant?\" asked Walters.\n\n\"Three heavy cruisers and a rocket destroyer, sir,\" replied the voice\nacross the gulf of space. \"And I am fully armed, sir.\"\n\n\"Proceed to quadrant four, Lieutenant, and seize the vessel _Space\nKnight_.\" There was a pause, and then Astro's blood ran cold as he heard\nthe words, \"and if necessary open fire!\"\n\nOn the control deck, Captain Strong turned to Walters quickly. \"But Tom\nand Roger, sir,\" he protested.\n\nCommander Walters glared at Strong and turned back to the audioceiver.\n\"Proceed to quadrant four,\" he said coldly. \"Seize the vessel _Space\nKnight_, and if there is any resistance, open fire!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Did'ja hear that!\" yelled Quent on the control deck of the _Space\nKnight_.\n\n[Illustration: \"_Proceed to quadrant four and seize the_ Space Knight!\"]\n\n\"I heard,\" replied Ross grimly. \"With a whole squadron sweeping this\nquadrant we won't make it.\"\n\n\"What are we going to do?\" asked Quent.\n\n\"We're staying right here.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Right here,\" said Ross. \"Get Corbett off the other ship and set the\nfuses in the firing chambers to blow up after we cast off.\"\n\n\"But I don't see--\"\n\n\"Don't ask questions!\" snapped Ross. \"Do as I tell you.\"\n\n\"O.K.\" Quent spun away and headed for the coupling locks that held the\ntwo ships together. Ross turned back to the ladder and flipped his ray\ngun on neutralizing charge, releasing Roger from the effects of the\nparalo ray.\n\nThe blond-haired cadet staggered to his feet shakily. \"Where's Tom?\" he\nsaid, clenching his teeth to keep them from rattling. \"If you've done\nanything to him--!\"\n\n\"Take it easy, Manning,\" growled Ross. \"Just get up on the control deck\nand behave.\"\n\nRoger glared at the spaceman, and realizing it would be useless to jump\nhim in his weakened condition, started up the ladder. Ross followed at a\ncareful distance.\n\nA few minutes later Quent appeared on the control deck, forcing Tom\nahead of him. \"All right,\" he growled. \"What do I do now?\"\n\n\"Did you cast off the other ship?\" asked Ross. And when Quent nodded, he\njerked his head toward Tom and Roger and barked, \"Cover them!\"\n\nAs Quent stood before the two cadets, his gun leveled, Ross strode to\nthe audioceiver and flipped it on. \"This is Quent Miles to Commander\nWalters aboard the _Polaris_,\" he called. \"Come in, Walters.\"\n\nTom and Roger looked at each other, puzzled.\n\n\"If you can hear me, Walters, this is Quent Miles. I'm surrendering to\nyou. And you alone! Call off your squadrons and come alongside in the\n_Polaris_ by yourself. If you hear me, Walters, you better do what I\nsay, or you'll never see Manning and Corbett again.\" He flipped the\naudioceiver off and grinned at his brother. \"When Walters comes aboard,\nhe's going to get a nice surprise.\"\n\n\"Like what?\" demanded Tom.\n\nRoss grinned wickedly, looking very much like the devil incarnate. \"You\nheard Walters' order to open fire, didn't you?\" he said. \"It seems that\nSpace Cadets aren't worth much as hostages. But what do you think it\nwill be like with a full-fledged commander in our hands, eh? And a\nrocket cruiser like the _Polaris_ to run around in.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't dare kidnap Commander Walters!\" exclaimed Tom.\n\n\"Oh, no.\" Ross laughed. \"Listen, punk, with a murder charge hanging over\nour heads, and a couple of million credits' worth of pitchblende in the\nholds, both of us would do anything! And don't you forget it!\" He turned\nto his brother. \"Come on over here, Quent, and I'll tell you what we're\ngoing to do.\"\n\nWhen the two spacemen were out of earshot, Tom turned to Roger. \"How do\nyou feel, Roger?\"\n\n\"As if I'm going to shake myself apart,\" replied the radar-deck cadet,\nhis teeth still chattering from the effects of the paralo ray.\n\n\"Well, hold on just a little bit longer, boy, because the next few\nminutes might spell the difference between getting out of here and--\"\n\nTom was cut off by a sudden blast from the loud-speaker of the\naudioceiver.\n\n\"This is Commander Walters!\" came a clear voice. \"I accept your\nproposal, Miles. But I warn you, if anything has happened to those\nboys--\"\n\n\"No, Commander!\" yelled Tom. \"It's a trap!\"\n\n\" ... you will suffer for it,\" the voice continued.\n\n\"No use, Tom,\" said Roger. \"The set was only on reception.\"\n\nThe two boys looked at each other and then across the control deck to\nthe grinning faces of the twins, Quent and Ross Miles.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 20\n\n\n\"Ease her up a little more, Steve!\"\n\nCommander Walters stood at the viewport watching the mighty _Polaris_\nslide alongside the black ship toward the coupling devices that would\nlock the two ships together in space.\n\n\"A little more!\" said Walters. \"About twenty feet!\"\n\n\"Short burst on the main jets!\" Strong called into the intercom.\n\n\"Aye, aye!\" shouted Astro from below.\n\nThe giant ship inched along, the skins of the two ships barely touching.\n\n\"That's it!\" shouted Walters. \"The magnetic coupling links are in place.\nWe're locked together!\" He turned to Strong and Barnard. \"Secure ship\nand come with me.\"\n\n\"Are you going to leave anyone on the ship, sir?\" asked Strong as he cut\nall power.\n\n\"No, I want everyone with me,\" replied Walters. \"No telling what Miles\nmight try. As soon as we get aboard, spread out and search the ship.\nFind Tom and Roger if you can and then come up to the control deck.\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" acknowledged Strong.\n\nWalters turned to the audioceiver and spoke sharply into the microphone.\n\"This is Walters, Miles. We're alongside and preparing to board your\nship. I warn you not to try any tricks. I've accepted your surrender and\nhold you to it on your honor as a spaceman!\" He paused, waiting for\nacknowledgment, then called again. \"Are you there, Miles?\"\n\nThere was a crackle of static over the loud-speaker and Miles' voice\nrang out on the control deck of the _Polaris_. \"I'm here, Walters. Come\non aboard!\"\n\nWalters turned to Strong and Kit. \"Let's go. You know your jobs, so\nsearch the ship and report on the control deck.\" He strode toward the\ncoupling locks that held the two ships together in space.\n\nAboard the black ship, Quent and Ross Miles smiled at each other. \"You\nknow what to do, Quent?\" said Ross.\n\nThe brother nodded. \"All set!\" he said.\n\n\"Get going then. And don't make a move until you hear me draw their\nattention!\"\n\n\"Right!\"\n\nThe two brothers shook hands and Quent turned away, hurriedly leaving\nthe control deck. Ross walked over to Tom and Roger, who watched the\nscene with anxious eyes.\n\n\"I really hate to do this, boys,\" he said, \"but as you can see, things\nare pretty tight!\" With that, he suddenly brought the butt of his ray\ngun down hard on Roger's head. The blond-haired cadet slumped to the\nfloor. Tom leaped at the spaceman, but before he could close with him,\nRoss stepped back quickly and brought the gun down sharply on his head.\nThe cadet slumped to the deck.\n\nQuickly Ross propped them up against the bulkhead. Then, after a fast\nlook around the control deck for any last thing he might have forgotten,\nhe walked casually over to the control station and sat down. Seconds\nlater Walters and Strong stepped inside.\n\n\"I arrest you for murder, willful destruction of Solar Guard property,\nand illegal operation of a uranium mine, Quent Miles!\" said Walters. The\nspaceman shrugged and said nothing.\n\nStrong bent over the unconscious forms of the two cadets and tried to\nbring them to, but they failed to respond.\n\n\"Better leave them alone, Steve,\" said Walters. \"We have to get a\nmedical officer for them. They look as if they've been bumped pretty\nhard.\"\n\nStrong stood up abruptly and walked over to Miles, who lounged casually\nin his chair. Ignoring Walters, the Solar Guard captain stood in front\nof the black-suited spaceman, his jaw within an inch of the other man's\nface.\n\n\"If anything serious has happened to those two boys, Miles,\" he said in\na cold, flat voice, full of menace, \"I'll tear you apart!\"\n\nMiles paled for an instant and then grinned uneasily. \"Don't worry about\nit, Strong. They're pretty tough kids.\"\n\nKit Barnard suddenly burst into the control room. \"I've searched the\ncargo holds, Commander,\" he said. \"Nothing there but lead boxes. Didn't\nfind the boys--\" Barnard stopped suddenly at the sight of the two\nunconscious cadets. \"Tom! Roger!\" he cried.\n\n\"They were slugged, Kit,\" said Strong. \"You go back to the _Polaris_ and\nsend out an emergency call. Find the closest ship with a medical\nofficer aboard and arrange for a meeting out here in space. We'll be\nready to blast in five minutes.\"\n\n\"O.K., Steve,\" replied Kit, turning to the door and then stopping to\nglare at Miles. \"And save a piece of that space rat for me!\"\n\nUnder Barnard's steely look, Miles rose to his feet and stepped back\nhesitantly. Then, suddenly, he jumped up on the chair, scrambled to the\ntop of the master control panel, and crouched there tensely.\n\nStrong, Walters, and Kit were momentarily stunned by his strange action.\nIt seemed like a senseless and futile effort to get away. There was no\nway Miles could get out of the control deck or off the ship.\n\nBeyond the reach of anyone on the control deck, Miles began to laugh.\n\nWalters turned beet red with anger. \"This is stupid, Miles!\" he roared.\n\"You can't get away and you know it!\"\n\n\"That all depends on where you're standing, Walters!\" said a voice from\nthe hatch.\n\nThe three spacemen whirled at the sound of the voice and were dumfounded\nby the appearance of Quent Miles, standing to one side of the hatch,\nholding an automatic paralo-ray rifle, trained on them.\n\n\"Stay right where you are,\" he said softly. \"The first man that moves\ngets frozen solid!\"\n\nWalters, Strong, and Kit were too stunned to make a move. They could\nonly stare in open disbelief at Quent Miles.\n\n\"Come on down, Ross!\" called Quent. \"And if anyone tries to stop him,\nI'll let all three of you have it!\"\n\nRoss climbed down from the control panel and stripped the three\nhelpless spacemen of their weapons. He threw them out of the hatch and\nthen went to stand by his brother. As they stood side by side, Strong\nand Walters couldn't help but gasp at the identical features of the two\nmen.\n\n\"You can never hope to get away, either of you,\" growled Walters, when\nhe finally regained his composure.\n\nQuent laughed. \"We're doing more than just hope, Walters.\"\n\n\"Just for your information,\" Ross chimed in, \"we're changing ships and\ntaking the cargo with us.\" He backed toward the hatch slowly. \"Come on,\nQuent.\" The two brothers stepped back through the doorway, Ross keeping\nhis rifle leveled at the three men.\n\nSafely outside, Quent slammed the heavy door closed. Then, with a rocket\nwrench, he worked on the outer nuts of the door used in emergency to\nseal off the ship by compartments.\n\n\"All set!\" said Quent, stepping back. \"They can't get out now until\nsomeone comes and loosens up those nuts.\"\n\n\"Get down below and start transferring that cargo to the _Polaris_,\"\nordered Ross, slinging the rifle over his shoulder. \"I'll get on the\naudioceiver and tell that cruiser squadron to go back.\"\n\nQuent laughed. \"You know, Ross, this is terrific,\" he chortled. \"We not\nonly get away, but we get ourselves a Solar Guard rocket cruiser.\nNobody'll be able to touch us in that ship.\"\n\n\"Nobody but me, Miles!\" said a voice behind them. The two brothers spun\naround to see Astro, stripped to the waist, a heavy lug wrench in his\nhand, legs spread apart, ready to spring.\n\n\"Had me fooled there for a while, Ross!\" he growled. \"I saw your brother\nback at the Academy and thought it was you. But he didn't have the split\near lobe, the one I gave you. Remember?\"\n\nRoss slowly reached for the rifle that was slung over his shoulder.\n\n\"Don't do it, Ross!\" warned Astro. \"Get your hands off that rifle or\nI'll ram this wrench down your throat!\"\n\nRoss lowered his hand again slowly.\n\n\"Who is this guy, Ross?\" asked Quent, licking his lips nervously. \"How\ndoes he know about us?\"\n\nRoss kept his eyes on Astro, glaring at the cadet in hot fury. \"I met\nhim on a deep spacer, five years ago, when you were laid up in the\nhospital,\" he said between his teeth. \"This punk was a wiper on the\npower deck. I was his petty officer.\"\n\n\"We got into a fight,\" snarled Astro, \"when he wanted to send me into a\nfiring chamber without letting it cool off first.\"\n\n\"There are two of us now, Astro!\" said Ross.\n\nAstro nodded slowly. \"That's right. Two of you!\" Suddenly he dove toward\nthe two men, arms outstretched. With one mighty swipe of the wrench he\nknocked Quent unconscious. Ross was hurled against the bulkhead by the\nimpact but managed to stay on his feet. Desperately he tore the\nparalo-ray rifle from his shoulder, but before he could level it, Astro\nwas upon him, wrenching it out of his grasp. Pushing Ross away, he\ncalmly broke it in two and threw the pieces to one side. Then he faced\nthe black-clad spaceman squarely.\n\n\"I was a kid when I first saw you, Ross,\" he said between his teeth. \"So\nyou had me fooled like everyone else. When your brother showed up at the\nAcademy with his ears in good shape, I thought it was a curious\ncoincidence two guys should look so much alike. And on Titan, when you\nhad me hauling up those boxes, you wore your hat all the time, along\nwith the oxygen mask, so I didn't think anything of it. But now I know!\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAll the while Astro talked, the two men circled each other like two\nwrestlers, each waiting for his opponent to make a mistake.\n\n\"So you know!\" sneered Ross. \"All right, wiper, come on!\"\n\nThe black-suited spaceman suddenly dove straight at Astro and the cadet\ncaught the full force of his body in his stomach. He sprawled on the\ndeck, gasping. Miles was on top of him in a second, hands at Astro's\nthroat.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nFire danced in the cadet's brain as Ross Miles' steely fingers closed\naround his windpipe. Slowly, with every ounce of strength he had in his\nbody, Astro grasped Miles' wrists in his hands and began squeezing. The\nfingers around the muscular wrists were the fingers of a boy filled\nwith hate and revenge. Slowly, very slowly, as the seconds ticked away\nand the wind whistled raggedly in his throat, Astro increased the\nenormous pressure.\n\nNow he felt the fingers around his throat begin to relax a little, and\nthen a little more, and he kept tightening the pressure of his mighty\nhands. Expressions of surprise and then pain spread across Miles' face\nand he finally relaxed his grip around Astro's throat. He struggled to\nfree himself from the viselike grip but it was hopeless.\n\nAstro continued to apply pressure. He forced Miles up from his chest and\nthen up on his feet, never relenting. Miles' face was now twisted in\nagony.\n\nThey stood on the deck, face to face, for almost a minute in silent\nstruggle. There seemed to be no end to the power in the cadet's hands.\n\nSuddenly Ross Miles slumped to his knees and sprawled on the deck as\nAstro let him go. The black-clad spaceman had fainted.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"They got a couple of hard bumps, but they'll be all right,\" announced\nthe medical officer, straightening up. \"But that man outside, Ross\nMiles, is going to stand trial with a broken wrist!\" He turned to\nStrong. \"What do you feed these cadets?\"\n\nStrong smiled and replied, \"These are special types we train to take\ncare of space rats!\"\n\nTom and Roger lay stretched out on emergency cots set up on the control\ndeck of the _Polaris_. They grinned weakly at Astro, who hovered over\nthem solicitously.\n\n\"This is the first time we've ever wound up an assignment on our backs,\nyou big Venusian hick!\" said Roger. \"And I suppose I'll have to thank\nyou for saving my life!\"\n\nAstro grinned. \"Wasn't much to save, Roger.\"\n\n\"Listen you!\" Roger rose on one elbow, but the medical officer pressed\nhim gently back on the cot.\n\n\"Did you ever find out how Bill Sticoon's ship was sabotaged, Captain\nStrong?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"We sure did, Tom,\" said Strong. \"One of Brett's confederates slugged\nthe Solar Guard officer in charge of monitoring the race on Deimos and\ntook his place. If it hadn't been for a brash stereo reporter that kept\ntaking pictures of everything and everyone, the impersonator wouldn't\nhave been caught.\"\n\n\"And to think that I wanted to give that reporter a few lumps!\" Tom\nexclaimed.\n\n\"Did you find out anything about the crash of Gigi Duarte's ship, sir?\"\nasked Roger.\n\n\"Yes. Ross confessed that he was in Luna City and planted a time bomb on\nGigi's ship when the French Chicken came in for refueling.\"\n\n\"Say,\" exclaimed Roger, \"I just happened to think! With Miles\ndisqualified, Kit wins the race!\"\n\nSeated in the pilot's chair, Kit turned to Roger and waved a paper.\n\"Here's the contract, Roger. Signed, sealed, and with only the crystal\nto be delivered.\"\n\n\"There's only one thing bothering me now,\" sighed Tom.\n\n\"What's that, Tom?\" asked Strong.\n\n\"Do you think I could get a three-day pass before we go back to class at\nthe Academy?\"\n\nStrong and Kit looked at each other, puzzled. \"With sick leave, you'll\nhave plenty of time,\" said Strong. \"Why a three-day pass especially?\"\n\nTom settled deeper into the cot. \"Well, sir,\" he said, grinning, \"I\nfigure it'll take just about three days for Astro and Roger to argue it\nout about who did the most to catch Ross and Quent Miles. And I don't\nwant to have to listen to it!\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIBER'S NOTES:\nStandardized Punctuation\nCorrected \" where necessary\nList of Illustrations: Changed quadrant five in caption to quadrant\n         four to match story\nPage 16: Changed oufit to outfit (Printer Error)\nPage 19: Changed jet-car to jet car for consistency\nPage 59: Changed well to we'll (Printer Error)\nPage 106: Changed Corbet to Corbett (Printer Error)\nPage 144: Changed I'll met you to I'll meet you (Printer Error)\nPage 149: Changed come alone with to come along with (Printer Error)\nPage 196: Changed quadrant five in caption to quadrant four to match\n         story\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Treachery in Outer Space, by \nCarey Rockwell and Louis Glanzman\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK TREACHERY IN OUTER SPACE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 18786.txt or 18786.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/8/7/8/18786/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Joseph R.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
