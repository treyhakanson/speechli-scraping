I prefer it to any other occupation I know of.\"\n\n\"When your headaches become sufficiently severe, you say that you have\nhallucinations,\" Hall said. \"Can you describe what you see during\nthose hallucinations?\"\n\n\"At first I had only the impression that I was in a place completely\nunlike anything I had ever known,\" Bennett answered. \"But each time my\nimpressions became sharper, and I carried a fairly clear picture when\nmy mind returned to normal the last time. I felt then that I had been\nin a room in a tall building that towered thousands of feet over a\ngreat city. I even remembered that the name of the city was Thone.\nThere were other people in the room with me--one person especially. I\nremembered her very clearly.\"\n\n\"Her?\" Hall asked.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Was there anything unusual about this woman?\"\n\n\"Well, yes, there was,\" Bennett said, after a brief and almost\nembarrassed pause. \"This will sound pretty adolescent, but--\"\n\nHall leaned forward attentively. \"It may be relevant. You're not here\nto be judged, you know; I'm trying to help you.\"\n\nBennett nodded and spoke rapidly, as though trying to finish before he\ncould stop himself. \"She was a woman who exactly fitted an image I've\nhad in mind for as long as I can remember. She was tall, fair--though\nbrunette--very beautiful, very vivid, very well poised. I seem to have\nknown her all my life, but only in my dreams, from my very earliest\nones to the present. She's never changed in all that time.\"\n\nHe halted as suddenly as he had begun to talk, either having nothing\nmore to say, or unwilling to say it.\n\n\"Have you ever married, Mr. Bennett?\" Hall prodded gently.\n\n\"No, I never have.\" Again, Bennett stopped, adding nothing more to his\nblunt answer.\n\n\"May I ask why not?\"\n\nBennett turned his face away. \"I was hoping you wouldn't ask that. It\nmakes me sound like a romantic kid.\" He looked at the doctor almost in\ndefiance. \"I've always felt that some day I would meet this girl, or\nat least someone very much like her. I know it's not a rational\nfeeling--maybe I've even used it as an excuse not to get married--but\nit's like spilling salt and throwing a pinch over our shoulder; we\naren't superstitious, yet we don't take any chances.\"\n\nDr. Hall didn't comment. He ended the questioning period and put\nBennett through a series of tests. Then they sat down again and Hall\noffered his diagnosis.\n\n\"The neurological examination is essentially negative, Mr. Bennett. In\nother words, there is no organic reason that I can find for your\nheadaches. That leaves only one other possibility--an emotional\ndisturbance. I'm a neurologist, remember, not a psychoanalyst. I can\nonly give an opinion about the cause of your complaint.\"\n\nBennett waited expectantly.\n\n\"Headaches without organic causes are generally the result of\nrepressed anger,\" Hall went on. \"That anger can stem from any number\nof traumatic situations or attitudes, all deeply buried in the\nunconscious, of course, or they would not have the power to hurt us.\nFrom what we know of you, however, it seems to be the result of\nfrustration. In other words, you have created a fantasy image of a\ncompletely unattainable woman, and therefore none of the women you\nmeet can fulfill your expectations. Since she is unattainable, you\nnaturally feel a sense of frustration.\"\n\n\"But who could she be?\" Bennett asked anxiously.\n\n\"Someone you knew in childhood, perhaps. A composite of real and\nimaginary women. Usually, it is an idealized image of your own\nmother.\"\n\nBennett sat frowning. \"All right, let's say that's so. But where do\nthe hallucinations of the city of Thone fit in?\"\n\n\"This is something that has to be tracked down in a series of\nanalytical sessions, so all I can do is guess. If one is unable to\nreach a goal in a real environment, the obvious answer is to create a\nfantasy world. That's what you appear to be doing. It's a dangerous\nsituation, Mr. Bennett. Potentially, at least.\"\n\n\"How so?\" Bennett asked, alarmed.\n\n\"The general tendency is toward greater and greater divorcement from\nreality. I suggest immediate treatment by a competent analyst. If you\ndon't know of one, I can recommend several.\"\n\n\"I'd like to think it over.\"\n\n\"Do that,\" Hall said. \"And call me when you've decided.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe third day after he consulted the neurologist, Bennett's headache\nreturned. As before, drugs were of no help. When the pain became\nblinding, he lay back on his bed, placed a cold cloth on his forehead,\nand closed his eyes.\n\nSuddenly the realities he knew were gone and he was back in the\ndream-city of Thone.\n\nPersons and objects were much clearer now. Bennett saw that he lay in\na receptacle shaped like a rectangular metal box. It was padded,\nreminding him unpleasantly of a coffin. The woman he had seen before\nwas again with him, but now he knew that her name was Lima. Behind her\nstood a man; a tall, dark man whose eyebrows joined over the bridge of\nhis nose, and whose forehead was creased in a permanent frown. The\nwoman held out her arms to Bennett. Her lips moved, but no sound came\nfrom them.\n\nBennett's spirit seemed to rise from the flesh--he could see his body\nstill lying there--and he followed the woman. As he approached she\nretreated and, try as he would to reach her, she remained just beyond\nhis grasp.\n\nAfter what seemed hours of futile pursuit, a cloud formed between him\nand the woman. When it dissipated, he had left the world of Thone. He\nwas in a trolley-bus, in his own world, and vaguely he recalled having\nleft his room, gone down to the street, and boarded the\ntrolley--during the time he had followed Lima, in his hallucination.\nIt seemed that he had a definite destination then, but now he could\nnot recall what it had been.\n\nHis attention was drawn to the outside by the flickering of lights\nthat flashed in through the bus windows. Bennett looked out and saw\nthat he was in the Pleasure Section of the city, traveling through the\nStreet of Carnivals. He watched the fronts of the amusement buildings\npass before him and he read their advertisements listlessly.\n\nSuddenly one sign seemed to spring out from all the others:\n\nLIMA\nMYSTIC OF THE MIND\n\nHe left the trolley at the next corner and made his way through the\ncrowd to the brightly lit carnival building.\n\nInside, he found a chair and seated himself. The show's act appeared\nabout half over. It was pretty evidently charlatan stuff, Bennett\ndecided, but the black-hooded mystic on the stage held his attention.\nShe was a tall woman, with a slender figure and fair flesh. She was\npoised, or perhaps it was indifference to the crowd.\n\nA runner went through the audience touching articles of clothing or\nornaments, and the woman without hesitation named each one he touched.\nThe act was slightly different from most Bennett had seen in that the\nrunner said nothing, merely touching the articles to be named.\n\nThe next portion of the show consisted of a mind-reading act. Bennett\nexpected the usual routine of writing a question on paper, which would\nbe sealed in an envelope and placed in a container on the stage.\n\nHe was surprised when the runner returned to the crowd and asked for\nvolunteers for thought-reading.\n\nA short man with a bright yellow necktie raised his hand. The runner\nmade his way through the crowd to the man and touched him on the\nshoulder before turning back to the mystic. He still said nothing.\n\n\"This man is thinking that he should have stayed at home tonight,\" the\nmystic said. \"There are wrestling matches on the teletone, and he\nwould have enjoyed them more than this show. Besides, he would have\nspent less money that way than he has tonight. And he does not like\nto spend money unless he must.\"\n\nA titter of amusement went through the crowd as the man blushed a dull\ncrimson.\n\nThe runner touched a second man.\n\n\"This man wishes to know the winner in the eighth race at the horse\ntracks tomorrow,\" she said. \"I am sorry, but, because of Public Law\none thousand thirty-two, Section five-A, I am prohibited from\nanswering a question of that nature.\"\n\nThe third person contacted was a woman. She raised her hand, then half\nchanged her mind when she saw that the runner was turning toward her.\nBut then she defiantly tossed her brown hair back from her face and\nallowed him to touch her shoulder.\n\n\"This woman is wondering if her lover is true to her--and if her\nhusband will find out about them.\"\n\nThis time the crowd laughed when the embarrassed woman turned pale and\nrushed up the aisle toward the exit.\n\nNo further hands were raised and the show ended with a short address\nby the runner: \"I hope you have enjoyed these truly marvelous and\nmysterious demonstrations. Now the mystic, Lima, is available for a\nshort time for personal interviews. The fee is very reasonable--one\ndollar a minute. Anyone wishing an interview please step forward.\"\n\nThe mystic pulled the hood from her head, smiled, bowed at the crowd,\nand left the stage.\n\nBennett gasped.\n\n\"The woman of the city of Thone!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You have paid in advance for twenty-five minutes of my time,\" Lima\nsaid, as she smiled in amusement. \"Perhaps you had better begin your\nquestions, instead of merely staring at me.\"\n\nBennett brought his thoughts back with an effort. \"Your performance\nwas exceptionally good,\" he said very soberly. \"I enjoyed it. And so,\napparently did the other customers. It is a clever routine. I'll admit\nI can't figure out how you do it.\"\n\n\"Remember what Barnum said,\" Lima replied lightly.\n\n\"At least you do not take yourself too seriously,\" Bennett observed.\n\n\"On the contrary.\" Lima countered, \"I take myself very seriously. You,\nhowever, do not. You are paying for my time and the customer is always\nright.\"\n\n\"Tell me,\" Bennett asked abruptly, \"have we ever met before?\"\n\n\"Not to my knowledge.\"\n\n\"Have you any objections to telling me about yourself during our\ninterview? Who are you? What is your background?\"\n\n\"I will be glad to tell you about myself, if you think it will be\ninteresting,\" she replied, after a barely perceptible pause. \"How I\ncame by this exceptional ability of mine, I have no slightest\nconception. I only remember that when I was young, and still without\nthe intellect to evaluate social mores and customs, I was often placed\nin positions of awkwardness by my ability to read minds. At an early\nage, however, through the council of my parents, I learned to keep\nthis knowledge to myself.\n\n\"By the time I reached my twentieth birthday, my parents were both\ndead and I was alone in the world. I had never learned any occupation.\nI made some attempts to use my mind-reading to some advantage to\nmyself, but soon found that I encountered the opposition of the\nmedical associations as well as the law. As a consequence, I turned to\nshow business as the one means of earning a legitimate livelihood.\nThere is not much more to tell.\"\n\n\"Can you actually read minds?\" Bennett asked insistently.\n\n\"I can.\"\n\n\"Then what am I thinking now?\"\n\n\"You are thinking,\" Lima said, with no semblance of a trance or any of\nthe other usual antics of professional mystics, \"that I look exactly\nlike a woman you have never seen, but whose image you have carried in\nyour mind since your childhood.\"\n\nFor just a moment, the startling accuracy disconcerted Bennett.\n\n\"I have a problem which is quite annoying,\" he pushed on almost\nfrantically. \"Can you tell me what my problem is?\"\n\n\"You have been subject to extremely severe headaches, which you have\nbeen unable to remedy, either by sedatives or with the help of a\nneurologist. Am I correct?\"\n\n\"More than you could possibly know! Look, I came here believing you\nwere a fake. That didn't matter--it was the fact that you looked like\nthis other woman that counted. I'm convinced now. I want your help.\nCan you help me, or at least tell me whether the neurologist is right\nabout the cause of my headaches?\"\n\n\"He is wrong,\" Lima said. \"I can tell you what causes them, but I am\nafraid that I will have to ask for another hundred dollars for that\nextra service.\"\n\nBennett was momentarily irritated at this evidence that their\nrelationship, at least as far as she was concerned, was strictly\nbusiness. But he shrugged off the feeling. He drew five twenty-dollar\nbills from his pocketbook and placed them on the table before her.\n\n\"If you remember,\" Lima said, folding the money carefully and tucking\nit into the neck of her dress, \"five months ago a building which you\nhad contracted to build fell, when it was nearly completed, and two\nworkmen were killed.\"\n\n\"I remember very well.\"\n\n\"You found that the collapse of the building was caused by faulty\nmaterial which you had bought through a subcontractor. You are still\ninvestigating to determine where to place the blame, and are on the\npoint of doing so.\"\n\n\"Go on,\" Bennett breathed softly.\n\n\"You are quite certain that the person responsible is John Tournay,\nostensibly a reputable contractor, but actually an unscrupulous\nscoundrel. You have a choice of exposing him, with great personal\ndanger to yourself--Tournay is a dangerous and ruthless man--or\nremaining silent and knowing that you are a coward. The difficulty of\nthat choice is causing your headaches.\"\n\n\"You may be right,\" Bennett admitted without hesitation. \"I haven't\nhad time to think the matter through quite that far. What would you\nadvise me to do?\"\n\n\"That is something which cannot be advised. The answer lies within\nyourself. You are either a big enough man to do the right thing--which\nyou yourself recognize--or you are a small man and will take the\nsafer, less honorable course. The decision and the integrity lie\nwithin yourself.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBennett slumped. \"I see that. Then there's nothing more that you can\ndo for me?\"\n\n\"But there is,\" Lima replied. \"I can cure your headaches, if you\nwish--for an additional hundred dollars.\"\n\n\"That would be a cheap price.\" Bennett drew his wallet from his\npocket. \"My cash is rather low. Would you accept a personal check?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" Lima said. \"But, first, let me explain about my cure.\nThere is some mental unpleasantness involved which you may consider\nworse than the ailment.\"\n\n\"I doubt that. I can't imagine anything worse than this agony.\"\n\n\"Your mind will be placed under my control and led through a dream\nsequence. I will follow a logical progression of events, using your\nactual past as background. While you are under my control, your\nexperiences will be far from pleasant. I will allow your mind to\nfollow its own anticipated course of events, influencing your thoughts\nonly slightly--directing them into as unpleasant channels as possible.\nIn fact, to make the cure certain, at least the culmination must be\nquite devastating. Do you agree to undergo such rigorous mental\npunishment?\"\n\n\"But why do I have to?\" Bennett asked, astonished and worried.\n\n\"That pattern will act in the manner of a counter-irritant. Your mind\nis like a spoiled child, rejecting anticipated unpleasantness. Under\nmy influence it is subjected to possible alternative experiences,\nwhich are so much worse than the one it originally feared that it will\ngratefully accept the lesser evil.\"\n\n\"That sounds reasonable,\" Bennett agreed. \"When could we begin this\ntreatment?\"\n\n\"Immediately, if you are willing.\"\n\n\"I see no reason for waiting.\"\n\n\"Then, if you are ready,\" Lima told him, \"lie on this couch. Keep your\neyes on mine.\" She spoke slowly, evenly. \"Remember that you are doing\nthis of your own free will, that you trust me. I am your friend and\nwould do you no harm.\"\n\nHer voice droned on as Bennett looked into her eyes. They merged until\nthey became one large, placid pool of restfulness, and he found\nhimself drawn into them.\n\nHe sank peacefully, quietly--completely.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen the telephone rang, Bennett knew it was the district attorney\nreturning his call, and that the die was cast. Until this ugly\nbusiness was brought to a conclusion, his life would be in constant\ndanger.\n\n\"Leroy Bennett speaking,\" he said. \"I have had collected some\ninformation that I think will be of very great interest to your\noffice.\"\n\n\"Information about what?\" the voice at the other end asked briskly.\n\n\"I have proof that John Tournay is responsible for the death of two\nmen, in an action involving criminal collusion.\"\n\n\"If what you say is true, I will be glad to see your evidence,\" the\ndistrict attorney said. \"Could you deliver it in person? There may be\nsome questions I would like to ask you about it.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" Bennett replied. \"When would be the most convenient\ntime?\"\n\n\"Later in the day. I have a case going on. How would four-thirty this\nafternoon suit you?\"\n\n\"That would be fine.\"\n\nThe rest of the day dragged slowly. At four o'clock Bennett left his\noffice and took the elevator to the ground floor. Under his arm he\nclutched the briefcase which might spell death for him.\n\nA moment after he left his office building, he knew he had made a\nmistake--a fatal one!\n\nIdly, at first, his mind's eye watched the driver of a long gray\nsedan, parked at the curb, start up its motor as he approached. The\ncar pulled away from the curb when he came alongside it.\n\nThrough an open rear window, Bennett saw a man with a dark, brooding\nface--with black eyebrows that joined over the bridge of the\nnose--glowering at him. At the same instant he saw the blunt nose of\nan automatic resting on the lowered glass of the window, just below\nthe chin of the frowning man.\n\nIncredibly, even as he realized that he was about to die, Bennett's\nfirst thought was not one of fear, but rather that this dark man was\nthe other person he had seen in his hallucinations of the city of\nThone!\n\nThen, as one part of his mind drew back in terror at what it knew was\nabout to happen, another part wondered at the mystery of Thone and the\npeople in it. Where did that hallucination fit in this mist of life\nwhich was about to end?\n\nHe felt three hard, solid blows punch shockingly into his body. There\nwas pain, but greater than that was the terror that whipped his\npanicked mind.\n\n\"Lima,\" Bennett whispered with his last stark thought as he dropped to\nhis knees.\n\nHe groped for the sidewalk with one hand, to steady himself, and never\nreached it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"It's over now,\" Bennett heard the mystic say. \"Please try to relax.\"\n\nHe found himself fighting with awful exertion to raise himself from\nthe sidewalk--which had turned into a couch. His clothes clung to him\nwith a clammy wetness that chilled him.\n\nHe flung his arms out in a frantic gesture that knocked a lamp from an\nend-table and sent it crashing to the floor.\n\nNot until then did he feel the mystic's firmly gentle hands on his\nshoulders, urging him down, and know that he was not actually dying.\nHe lay back for a moment, gasping great gulps of welcome air into his\nlungs.\n\n\"I think you will be all right now,\" Lima said.\n\n\"You were right when you said the experience would not be pleasant,\"\nBennett said, still battling for breath. \"I hope the results will be\nworth it.\"\n\n\"I believe you will find that they are,\" Lima told him reassuringly.\n\"Also, it can be of assistance to you in still another way. The\nsequence your dream followed--being a natural, perhaps even a\nprobable, aftermath of your past decisions and movements--could\nactually happen. Therefore it would be wise to avoid such decisions\nin real life.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt the end of two weeks, Bennett had collected all the information he\nneeded on Tournay's illegal activities. The investigator he hired was\nvery thorough, and unearthed several other incriminating schemes in\nTournay's past. With the evidence he had on hand, Bennett was certain\nthat Tournay would be convicted in any court.\n\nThis time he intended to evade the fate he had suffered in the dream\nby acting differently. He hired a shrewd lawyer--the best\nobtainable--had him draw up the evidence in legal form, and presented\nit to the district attorney, with the demand for Tournay's immediate\narrest. He knew that immediate action would be his best protection.\n\nThat evening, when he left his office building, he felt the peace of a\nman whose task has been well done.\n\nIt took almost a full second before the sight of the long gray car\njerked his thoughts from their pleasant introspection and back to\ndread reality. Tournay's black-browed face leered at him as it had in\nthe dream and he felt his body tense as it waited for the pistol slugs\nto strike.\n\nHis mind scurried in its trap within his head and, strangely, it\nturned to the mystic for help.\n\n\"Lima!\" he called desperately.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAgain Bennett felt himself struggling with that awful exertion to drag\nhis body from the couch on which it lay.\n\n\"It's all over now,\" he heard Lima say.\n\nHe sat up. \"What happened?\"\n\n\"This will be hard to believe,\" Lima said, \"and I will not try to\nprove it to you, but it is true. The mind has many powers which cannot\neven be imagined by anyone who has not lived with those powers as I\nhave. When you called me, your mind attuned itself with mine, and its\nneed and its demand were so powerful that together we turned time\nbackward. You are now back in my dressing room, and it is the exact\ntime at which you originally came out of your dream.\"\n\n\"That's impossible!\" Bennett protested.\n\n\"Nevertheless, it happened. I only ask you to keep in mind one thing.\nSomeday, when your mind has been made more facile, you will understand\nhow I am able to do this. It will even appear logical to you. Now,\nhowever, the only thing I can tell you is _believe it_!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBennett had no intention of muffing this second chance. After he had\ncollected the information about Tournay's criminal activities, he\nalso dug into his past for a man who had cause to hate the contractor.\nHe found the man he sought, a man as ruthless and unscrupulous as\nTournay himself, one who could fight him on his own ground.\n\nRoger Clarkson had been the controller of a string of bookie joints,\nbefore he had been framed by Tournay, and convicted, to serve ten\nyears in prison.\n\nClarkson had been released from prison six days before. He found that\nTournay had gained control of his former criminal empire. Everyone,\nincluding Tournay, knew that the only thing preventing Clarkson from\ntaking revenge was the opportunity.\n\nBennett sent his information to Clarkson and sat back to await the\nresults. That evening, as he was about to leave his office building,\nsome inner caution warned him to take no chances. He stepped\ncautiously out into the street, looked both ways for the gray sedan,\nand saw that the street was empty, before he walked to the corner.\n\nHe arrived there just in time to meet the long gray sedan as it drove\nup.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOnce more he fought the awful exertion on the mystic's couch. This\ntime he came out of the blackness with his mind clear. \"You've saved\nme again,\" he said to Lima. \"Have you turned time backward again?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied. \"But I have given you all the help I can. The next\nattempt you make, you will have nothing on which to lean except your\nown strength.\"\n\n\"But why do I always arrive at the point where I'm being shot by\nTournay, regardless of what course I choose? Is there no way I can\nbeat him?\"\n\n\"If you believe in fate as strongly as I do, you will accept that\nconclusion as inevitable. The long gray sedan is the symbol of your\ndeath. You cannot avoid it--at least not as long as you persist in\npassive action.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"Just this. You wish to see Tournay punished--your sense of justice\ndemands it. But each time you try to have someone else administer that\npunishment. It appears to me that the only possibility of your\nbreaking this fateful progression of events is for you to administer\nthe punishment yourself. You probably realize the danger of trying\nthat. But I can't see where you have any other choice.\"\n\n\"In other words, you feel that the only chance I have of preventing\nTournay from killing me--is to kill him first?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Lima said. \"Are you strong and hard enough to do it?\"\n\nBennett thought for only a brief moment before he nodded. \"I'm\ndesperate enough, at any rate.\"\n\nThis time he did not leave immediately. He had to find out something\nfirst. He put his arms around Lima's shoulders and drew her toward\nhim. She put her face up and he kissed her waiting lips. They were\nsweet and, if she did not return the ardor of his kiss, he did not\nnotice it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Mr. Tournay is not in,\" the girl at the desk told Bennett. \"You might\ntry his home.\"\n\nAt a pay-booth in the lobby, Bennett called Tournay's home. The voice\nthat answered was that of a tired woman, one who has given up hope.\n\"Mr. Tournay called me a short time ago and said that he would be in\nthe office of a Mr. Leroy Bennett, in the Lowry building, if anyone\ncalled,\" the tired voice said.\n\nBennett hung up and caught a cab. His quarry had walked into an ideal\nplace for their meeting. For better or for worse, he would soon bring\nthis conflict to an end.\n\nIn his office, Bennett found that Tournay had been there and gone. He\nhad left a message: \"Tell Mr. Bennett that Lima sent me!\"\n\nSo that was it--Lima had used Bennett as a dupe! He could not figure\nout her purpose, but he knew that he could never trust her again. She\nhad been against him from the first. Perhaps even she, rather than\nTournay, was the prime menace. He decided that he must kill them both,\nbefore they had the chance to kill him. Touching the small flat pistol\nsnuggling in its shoulder holster, he knew the pursuit must continue\nimmediately.\n\nHe rode the elevator to the ground floor, and he felt his mind working\nwith a clarity and a precision which he had seldom experienced before.\nThis time he knew he would win.\n\nShrewdly, before leaving the building, Bennett looked out through the\nglass pane in the door first. He waited only a moment before he saw\nthe long gray sedan as he had expected. They would not trap him again.\nDucking back, he walked rapidly toward a side exit.\n\nNight had fallen by the time he reached the carnival building. He did\nnot ring the bell. Instead, he walked to the rear, climbed the stairs\nof a fire-escape, and softly opened the window of a bedroom.\n\nHe stepped inside just as softly and stood listening for breathing. He\nheard none. This was probably too early for Lima to be in bed.\n\nThe bedroom door was open. Bennett could see a light coming from\nanother part of the apartment--probably the living room. He paused to\nsteel himself for what he must do. The time had come when he would\nhave to be savagely ruthless.\n\nHe found Lima sitting on a couch, reading a book. He suspected that\nshe still had some control over his mind and he had no intention of\nletting her influence him. She must be killed before she could read\nhis intention.\n\n\"It didn't work.\" Bennett spoke just loudly enough to startle Lima\ninto raising her head.\n\nAs she looked up, he shot her squarely between the eyes.\n\nIn an agony of frustration, Bennett saw the flesh of her forehead\nremain clear and undisturbed. He knew he could not miss at this range,\nyet she was unhurt. He lowered his sights and shot at the white neck\nbeneath the fair head. She still sat there, returning his gaze,\nunperturbed, unmarked by the bullets.\n\nHe pumped the four remaining bullets into her body. The only part of\nher that moved was her lips.\n\n\"It's no use, Leroy,\" she said. \"Haven't you guessed? You are still in\nyour dream. You can't kill me there.\"\n\nSuddenly the implication struck him with its awful simplicity.\n\n\"Good God!\" His voice rose. \"Do you mean I've never been out of my\ndream?\" He hesitated while the thought sank in. \"My remembrance of\ncoming out of it was only part of the dream itself,\" he murmured.\n\"That was why you were able to turn time backward at will.\"\n\nA cold calmness returned to him.\n\n\"Tell me,\" he said, \"am I still in the dream?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Lima replied.\n\n\"Then I demand that you free me now!\"\n\n\"As you wish,\" Lima said sadly. \"And may God help you.\"\n\nBennett wrenched his body from the couch on which it lay and struggled\nto his feet. Though the dream had seemed real enough, he could look\nback on it now and see it as any other dream.\n\nHe breathed easier, and then stopped abruptly when he heard a voice\nbehind him say, \"You are still a dead man!\"\n\nBennett whirled and found himself facing Tournay. And Tournay held a\npistol aimed at his heart.\n\nBennett turned desperately back to Lima. His lips formed her name, but\nthe sound died almost before it was uttered. This time, he saw, she\nwould not help him. Her features had hardened and no mercy or\ncompassion registered on them.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"There is no escape,\" she said.\n\nA fleeting thought went through his mind of springing at Tournay and\ntrying to reach him before the gun could be fired. But one glance at\nTournay's face made him realize how futile--and fatal--that would be.\n\nTournay's finger tightened on the trigger of his gun and Bennett\nthought ahead in despair to what was to come. One thing he knew: He\ndid not want to die! Was there no way out?\n\nThe answer came like a cry of relief. There was a way--Thone! The city\nof his enigma. Tournay and Lima could not harm him there.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor just an instant, Bennett's vision blurred. Time paused, and the\nnext moment he knew he had returned to Thone. The sounds of the alien\ncity floated up to him and he stirred.\n\nHe grasped the sides of his coffinlike bed with fingers that had lost\ntheir sense of touch. He pulled himself up to a sitting position and\nlooked about him. On one side stood Lima, though now her features were\nnot those of the implacable, merciless mystic, but rather those of a\nwoman in love.\n\nShe smiled happily and said, \"At last you have returned.\"\n\nBennett strove to move his tongue and lips to ask questions, but they\nrefused, as though numbed by long inaction. He turned to his other\nside and gazed questioningly at the replica of Tournay who stood\nthere.\n\nTournay's image spoke. \"We had quite a time bringing you back, Sire.\nBut now it has been accomplished--for good.\"\n\nStriving to move his throat muscles, Bennett finally forced a sound,\nand then words, through his lips.\n\n\"Tell me,\" he pleaded. \"Who are you? And, more important, who am I?\"\n\nHe turned to Lima for an answer, realizing that now she would help him\nif anyone would.\n\n\"Doctor Tournay will explain it to you,\" Lima replied, indicating the\ndark man.\n\nImploringly, Bennett turned back to face Tournay.\n\n\"I see that very little of your memory has returned yet,\" Tournay\nsaid. \"In a short while, everything--all your past--will come back to\nyou. Until then, perhaps I had better explain to you who you are. My\nwords will help trigger your returning memory, and speed up the\nprocess.\"\n\n\"Please do,\" Bennett begged.\n\n\"You are Benn Ett, _Le Roy_ of the city-state of Thone, in the year\n4526 A. D. Six months ago, the strain of governing the city began to\nundermine your health. Acting under my advice, you decided to take a\nsomno-rest cure.\n\n\"This rest cure,\" the doctor continued, \"is quite standard practice in\nour time. We had a little difficulty bringing you out of it at the end\nof six months. Evidently your somno-existence must have been very\npleasant.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that the existence I remember was merely an induced\nfigment of my imagination?\"\n\n\"Yes. You see, the best rest that can be given a mind is to give it\nnot sleep, but pleasant work. Therefore, under my manipulation, you\nwere given a pseudo-existence in a past era of history. You were led\nto conceive yourself as occupying a position, which, after close\nstudy, I deduced would be the most suitable and relaxing for you.\"\n\n\"But if that is true, why did my dream have to end so unpleasantly--I\nmight say, so nearly fatally?\" Bennett demanded.\n\n\"The more successful I am in choosing a pleasant existence for a\npatient in the somno, the more difficult it is to bring him out of\nit,\" the doctor replied. \"Your unconscious mind, realizing how happy\nyou were in your simulated existence, and how it would have to return\nto the rigor and stress which unnerved it before, fought with all its\nstrength to remain where the somno had placed it.\n\n\"The usual practice in bringing a patient back to reality is for the\ndoctor to enter the dream and convince him, by whatever means may be\nnecessary, to return. Sometimes, however, the patient is so firmly\ntied to his somno-existence that drastic measures must be used. This\nis usually done by means of making the somno-existence so\nanxiety-producing that the patient is glad to return.\n\n\"Your particular release was one of the most difficult that I have\never encountered. In fact, I was unable to bring you back myself, and\nasked your wife, Lima, to enter the somno with me and help force you\nto return.\"\n\nBits of recollection, which had been edging into Bennett's memory,\nburst through in full force, and he remembered. It was true. He _was_\nBenn Ett, _Le Roy_ of the city-state of Thone.\n\nHe turned to Lima and, as he read the glad light in her eyes, he knew\nthat she had witnessed the return of his complete memory.\n\n\"Welcome home,\" she said.\n\n                                                      --CHARLES V.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
