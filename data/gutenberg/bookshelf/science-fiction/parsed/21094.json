Astronomers tell us of the\nimmensity of space. I have tried to imagine space as finite. It is\nimpossible. How can you conceive the edge of space? Something must be\nbeyond--something or nothing, and even that would be more space,\nwouldn't it?\"\n\n\"Gosh,\" said the Very Young Man, and lighted another cigarette.\n\nThe Chemist resumed, smiling a little. \"Now, if it seems probable that\nthere is no limit to the immensity of space, why should we make its\nsmallness finite? How can you say that the atom cannot be divided? As a\nmatter of fact, it already has been. The most powerful microscope will\nshow you realms of smallness to which you can penetrate no other way.\nMultiply that power a thousand times, or ten thousand times, and who\nshall say what you will see?\"\n\nThe Chemist paused, and looked at the intent little group around him.\n\nHe was a youngish man, with large features and horn-rimmed glasses, his\nrough English-cut clothes hanging loosely over his broad, spare frame.\nThe Banker drained his glass and rang for the waiter.\n\n\"Very interesting,\" he remarked.\n\n\"Don't be an ass, George,\" said the Big Business Man. \"Just because you\ndon't understand, doesn't mean there is no sense to it.\"\n\n\"What I don't get clearly\"--began the Doctor.\n\n\"None of it's clear to me,\" said the Very Young Man.\n\nThe Doctor crossed under the light and took an easier chair. \"You\nintimated you had discovered something unusual in these realms of the\ninfinitely small,\" he suggested, sinking back luxuriously. \"Will you\ntell us about it?\"\n\n\"Yes, if you like,\" said the Chemist, turning from one to the other. A\nnod of assent followed his glance, as each settled himself more\ncomfortably.\n\n\"Well, gentlemen, when you say I have discovered something unusual in\nanother world--in the world of the infinitely small--you are right in a\nway. I have seen something and lost it. You won't believe me probably,\"\nhe glanced at the Banker an instant, \"but that is not important. I am\ngoing to tell you the facts, just as they happened.\"\n\nThe Big Business Man filled up the glasses all around, and the Chemist\nresumed:\n\n\"It was in 1910, this problem first came to interest me. I had never\ngone in for microscopic work very much, but now I let it absorb all my\nattention. I secured larger, more powerful instruments--I spent most of\nmy money,\" he smiled ruefully, \"but never could I come to the end of the\nspace into which I was looking. Something was always hidden\nbeyond--something I could almost, but not quite, distinguish.\n\n\"Then I realized that I was on the wrong track. My instrument was not\nmerely of insufficient power, it was not one-thousandth the power I\nneeded.\n\n\"So I began to study the laws of optics and lenses. In 1913 I went\nabroad, and with one of the most famous lens-makers of Europe I produced\na lens of an entirely different quality, a lens that I hoped would give\nme what I wanted. So I returned here and fitted up my microscope that I\nknew would prove vastly more powerful than any yet constructed.\n\n\"It was finally completed and set up in my laboratory, and one night I\nwent in alone to look through it for the first time. It was in the fall\nof 1914, I remember, just after the first declaration of war.\n\n\"I can recall now my feelings at that moment. I was about to see into\nanother world, to behold what no man had ever looked on before. What\nwould I see? What new realms was I, first of all our human race, to\nenter? With furiously beating heart, I sat down before the huge\ninstrument and adjusted the eyepiece.\n\n\"Then I glanced around for some object to examine. On my finger I had a\nring, my mother's wedding-ring, and I decided to use that. I have it\nhere.\" He took a plain gold band from his little finger and laid it on\nthe table.\n\n\"You will see a slight mark on the outside. That is the place into which\nI looked.\"\n\nHis friends crowded around the table and examined a scratch on one side\nof the band.\n\n\"What did you see?\" asked the Very Young Man eagerly.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" resumed the Chemist, \"what I saw staggered even my own\nimagination. With trembling hands I put the ring in place, looking\ndirectly down into that scratch. For a moment I saw nothing. I was like\na person coming suddenly out of the sunlight into a darkened room. I\nknew there was something visible in my view, but my eyes did not seem\nable to receive the impressions. I realize now they were not yet\nadjusted to the new form of light. Gradually, as I looked, objects of\ndefinite shape began to emerge from the blackness.\n\n\"Gentlemen, I want to make clear to you now--as clear as I can--the\npeculiar aspect of everything that I saw under this microscope. I seemed\nto be inside an immense cave. One side, near at hand, I could now make\nout quite clearly. The walls were extraordinarily rough and indented,\nwith a peculiar phosphorescent light on the projections and blackness in\nthe hollows. I say phosphorescent light, for that is the nearest word I\ncan find to describe it--a curious radiation, quite different from the\nreflected light to which we are accustomed.\n\n\"I said that the hollows inside of the cave were blackness. But not\nblackness--the absence of light--as we know it. It was a blackness that\nseemed also to radiate light, if you can imagine such a condition; a\nblackness that seemed not empty, but merely withholding its contents\njust beyond my vision.\n\n\"Except for a dim suggestion of roof over the cave, and its floor, I\ncould distinguish nothing. After a moment this floor became clearer. It\nseemed to be--well, perhaps I might call it black marble--smooth,\nglossy, yet somewhat translucent. In the foreground the floor was\napparently liquid. In no way did it differ in appearance from the solid\npart, except that its surface seemed to be in motion.\n\n\"Another curious thing was the outlines of all the shapes in view. I\nnoticed that no outline held steady when I looked at it directly; it\nseemed to quiver. You see something like it when looking at an object\nthrough water--only, of course, there was no distortion. It was also\nlike looking at something with the radiation of heat between.\n\n\"Of the back and other side of the cave, I could see nothing, except in\none place, where a narrow effulgence of light drifted out into the\nimmensity of the distance behind.\n\n\"I do not know how long I sat looking at this scene; it may have been\nseveral hours. Although I was obviously in a cave, I never felt shut\nin--never got the impression of being in a narrow, confined space.\n\n\"On the contrary, after a time I seemed to feel the vast immensity of\nthe blackness before me. I think perhaps it may have been that path of\nlight stretching out into the distance. As I looked it seemed like the\nreversed tail of a comet, or the dim glow of the Milky Way, and\npenetrating to equally remote realms of space.\n\n\"Perhaps I fell asleep, or at least there was an interval of time during\nwhich I was so absorbed in my own thoughts I was hardly conscious of the\nscene before me.\n\n\"Then I became aware of a dim shape in the foreground--a shape merged\nwith the outlines surrounding it. And as I looked, it gradually assumed\nform, and I saw it was the figure of a young girl, sitting beside the\nliquid pool. Except for the same waviness of outline and phosphorescent\nglow, she had quite the normal aspect of a human being of our own world.\nShe was beautiful, according to our own standards of beauty; her long\nbraided hair a glowing black, her face, delicate of feature and winsome\nin expression. Her lips were a deep red, although I felt rather than saw\nthe colour.\n\n\"She was dressed only in a short tunic of a substance I might describe\nas gray opaque glass, and the pearly whiteness of her skin gleamed with\niridescence.\n\n\"She seemed to be singing, although I heard no sound. Once she bent over\nthe pool and plunged her hand into it, laughing gaily.\n\n\"Gentlemen, I cannot make you appreciate my emotions, when all at once I\nremembered I was looking through a microscope. I had forgotten entirely\nmy situation, absorbed in the scene before me. And then, abruptly, a\ngreat realization came upon me--the realization that everything I saw\nwas inside that ring. I was unnerved for the moment at the importance of\nmy discovery.\n\n\"When I looked again, after the few moments my eye took to become\naccustomed to the new form of light, the scene showed itself as before,\nexcept that the girl had gone.\n\n\"For over a week, each night at the same time I watched that cave. The\ngirl came always, and sat by the pool as I had first seen her. Once she\ndanced with the wild grace of a wood nymph, whirling in and out the\nshadows, and falling at last in a little heap beside the pool.\n\n\"It was on the tenth night after I had first seen her that the accident\nhappened. I had been watching, I remember, an unusually long time before\nshe appeared, gliding out of the shadows. She seemed in a different\nmood, pensive and sad, as she bent down over the pool, staring into it\nintently. Suddenly there was a tremendous cracking sound, sharp as an\nexplosion, and I was thrown backward upon the floor.\n\n\"When I recovered consciousness--I must have struck my head on\nsomething--I found the microscope in ruins. Upon examination I saw that\nits larger lens had exploded--flown into fragments scattered around the\nroom. Why I was not killed I do not understand. The ring I picked up\nfrom the floor; it was unharmed and unchanged.\n\n\"Can I make you understand how I felt at this loss? Because of the war\nin Europe I knew I could never replace my lens--for many years, at any\nrate. And then, gentlemen, came the most terrible feeling of all; I knew\nat last that the scientific achievement I had made and lost counted for\nlittle with me. It was the girl. I realized then that the only being I\never could care for was living out her life with her world, and, indeed,\nher whole universe, in an atom of that ring.\"\n\nThe Chemist stopped talking and looked from one to the other of the\ntense faces of his companions.\n\n\"It's almost too big an idea to grasp,\" murmured the Doctor.\n\n\"What caused the explosion?\" asked the Very Young Man.\n\n\"I do not know.\" The Chemist addressed his reply to the Doctor, as the\nmost understanding of the group. \"I can appreciate, though, that through\nthat lens I was magnifying tremendously those peculiar light-radiations\nthat I have described. I believe the molecules of the lens were\nshattered by them--I had exposed it longer to them that evening than any\nof the others.\"\n\nThe Doctor nodded his comprehension of this theory.\n\nImpressed in spite of himself, the Banker took another drink and leaned\nforward in his chair. \"Then you really think that there is a girl now\ninside the gold of that ring?\" he asked.\n\n\"He didn't say that necessarily,\" interrupted the Big Business Man.\n\n\"Yes, he did.\"\n\n\"As a matter of fact, I do believe that to be the case,\" said the\nChemist earnestly. \"I believe that every particle of matter in our\nuniverse contains within it an equally complex and complete a universe,\nwhich to its inhabitants seems as large as ours. I think, also that the\nwhole realm of our interplanetary space, our solar system and all the\nremote stars of the heavens are contained within the atom of some other\nuniverse as gigantic to us as we are to the universe in that ring.\"\n\n\"Gosh!\" said the Very Young Man.\n\n\"It doesn't make one feel very important in the scheme of things, does\nit?\" remarked the Big Business Man dryly.\n\nThe Chemist smiled. \"The existence of no individual, no nation, no\nworld, nor any one universe is of the least importance.\"\n\n\"Then it would be possible,\" said the Doctor, \"for this gigantic\nuniverse that contains us in one of its atoms, to be itself contained\nwithin the atom of another universe, still more gigantic, and so on.\"\n\n\"That is my theory,\" said the Chemist.\n\n\"And in each of the atoms of the rocks of that cave there may be other\nworlds proportionately minute?\"\n\n\"I can see no reason to doubt it.\"\n\n\"Well, there is no proof, anyway,\" said the Banker. \"We might as well\nbelieve it.\"\n\n\"I intend to get proof,\" said the Chemist.\n\n\"Do you believe all these innumerable universes, both larger and smaller\nthan ours, are inhabited?\" asked the Doctor.\n\n\"I should think probably most of them are. The existence of life, I\nbelieve, is as fundamental as the existence of matter without life.\"\n\n\"How do you suppose that girl got in there?\" asked the Very Young Man,\ncoming out of a brown study.\n\n\"What puzzled me,\" resumed the Chemist, ignoring the question, \"is why\nthe girl should so resemble our own race. I have thought about it a good\ndeal, and I have reached the conclusion that the inhabitants of any\nuniverse in the next smaller or larger plane to ours probably resemble\nus fairly closely. That ring, you see, is in the same--shall we\nsay--environment as ourselves. The same forces control it that control\nus. Now, if the ring had been created on Mars, for instance, I believe\nthat the universes within its atoms would be inhabited by beings like\nthe Martians--if Mars has any inhabitants. Of course, in planes beyond\nthose next to ours, either smaller or larger, changes would probably\noccur, becoming greater as you go in or out from our own universe.\"\n\n\"Good Lord! It makes one dizzy to think of it,\" said the Big Business\nMan.\n\n\"I wish I knew how that girl got in there,\" sighed the Very Young Man,\nlooking at the ring.\n\n\"She probably didn't,\" retorted the Doctor. \"Very likely she was created\nthere, the same as you were here.\"\n\n\"I think that is probably so,\" said the Chemist. \"And yet, sometimes I\nam not at all sure. She was very human.\" The Very Young Man looked at\nhim sympathetically.\n\n\"How are you going to prove your theories?\" asked the Banker, in his\nmost irritatingly practical way.\n\nThe Chemist picked up the ring and put it on his finger. \"Gentlemen,\" he\nsaid. \"I have tried to tell you facts, not theories. What I saw through\nthat ultramicroscope was not an unproven theory, but a fact. My theories\nyou have brought out by your questions.\"\n\n\"You are quite right,\" said the Doctor; \"but you did mention yourself\nthat you hoped to provide proof.\"\n\nThe Chemist hesitated a moment, then made his decision. \"I will tell you\nthe rest,\" he said.\n\n\"After the destruction of the microscope, I was quite at a loss how to\nproceed. I thought about the problem for many weeks. Finally I decided\nto work along another altogether different line--a theory about which I\nam surprised you have not already questioned me.\"\n\nHe paused, but no one spoke.\n\n\"I am hardly ready with proof to-night,\" he resumed after a moment.\n\"Will you all take dinner with me here at the club one week from\nto-night?\" He read affirmation in the glance of each.\n\n\"Good. That's settled,\" he said, rising. \"At seven, then.\"\n\n\"But what was the theory you expected us to question you about?\" asked\nthe Very Young Man.\n\nThe Chemist leaned on the back of his chair.\n\n\"The only solution I could see to the problem,\" he said slowly, \"was to\nfind some way of making myself sufficiently small to be able to enter\nthat other universe. I have found such a way and one week from to-night,\ngentlemen, with your assistance, I am going to enter the surface of that\nring at the point where it is scratched!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nINTO THE RING\n\n\nThe cigars were lighted and dinner over before the Doctor broached the\nsubject uppermost in the minds of every member of the party.\n\n\"A toast, gentlemen,\" he said, raising his glass. \"To the greatest\nresearch chemist in the world. May he be successful in his adventure\nto-night.\"\n\nThe Chemist bowed his acknowledgment.\n\n\"You have not heard me yet,\" he said smiling.\n\n\"But we want to,\" said the Very Young Man impulsively.\n\n\"And you shall.\" He settled himself more comfortably in his chair.\n\"Gentlemen, I am going to tell you, first, as simply as possible, just\nwhat I have done in the past two years. You must draw your own\nconclusions from the evidence I give you.\n\n\"You will remember that I told you last week of my dilemma after the\ndestruction of the microscope. Its loss and the impossibility of\nreplacing it, led me into still bolder plans than merely the visual\nexamination of this minute world. I reasoned, as I have told you, that\nbecause of its physical proximity, its similar environment, so to speak,\nthis outer world should be capable of supporting life identical with our\nown.\n\n\"By no process of reasoning can I find adequate refutation of this\ntheory. Then, again, I had the evidence of my own eyes to prove that a\nbeing I could not tell from one of my own kind was living there. That\nthis girl, other than in size, differs radically from those of our race,\nI cannot believe.\n\n\"I saw then but one obstacle standing between me and this other\nworld--the discrepancy of size. The distance separating our world from\nthis other is infinitely great or infinitely small, according to the\nviewpoint. In my present size it is only a few feet from here to the\nring on that plate. But to an inhabitant of that other world, we are as\nremote as the faintest stars of the heavens, diminished a thousand\ntimes.\"\n\nHe paused a moment, signing the waiter to leave the room.\n\n\"This reduction of bodily size, great as it is, involves no deeper\nprinciple than does a light contraction of tissue, except that it must\nbe carried further. The problem, then, was to find a chemical,\nsufficiently unharmful to life, that would so act upon the body cells as\nto cause a reduction in bulk, without changing their shape. I had to\nsecure a uniform and also a proportionate rate of contraction of each\ncell, in order not to have the body shape altered.\n\n\"After a comparatively small amount of research work, I encountered an\napparently insurmountable obstacle. As you know, gentlemen, our living\nhuman bodies are held together by the power of the central intelligence\nwe call the mind. Every instant during your lifetime your subconscious\nmind is commanding and directing the individual life of each cell that\nmakes up your body. At death this power is withdrawn; each cell is\nthrown under its own individual command, and dissolution of the body\ntakes place.\n\n\"I found, therefore, that I could not act upon the cells separately, so\nlong as they were under control of the mind. On the other hand, I could\nnot withdraw this power of the subconscious mind without causing death.\n\n\"I progressed no further than this for several months. Then came the\nsolution. I reasoned that after death the body does not immediately\ndisintegrate; far more time elapses than I expected to need for the\ncell-contraction. I devoted my time, then to finding a chemical that\nwould temporarily withhold, during the period of cell-contraction, the\npower of the subconscious mind, just as the power of the conscious mind\nis withheld by hypnotism.\n\n\"I am not going to weary you by trying to lead you through the maze of\nchemical experiments into which I plunged. Only one of you,\" he\nindicated the Doctor, \"has the technical basis of knowledge to follow\nme. No one had been before me along the path I traversed. I pursued the\nmethod of pure theoretical deduction, drawing my conclusions from the\npractical results obtained.\n\n\"I worked on rabbits almost exclusively. After a few weeks I succeeded\nin completely suspending animation in one of them for several hours.\nThere was no life apparently existing during that period. It was not a\ntrance or coma, but the complete simulation of death. No harmful results\nfollowed the revivifying of the animal. The contraction of the cells was\nfar more difficult to accomplish; I finished my last experiment less\nthan six months ago.\"\n\n\"Then you really have been able to make an animal infinitely small?\"\nasked the Big Business Man.\n\nThe Chemist smiled. \"I sent four rabbits into the unknown last week,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"What did they look like going?\" asked the Very Young Man. The Chemist\nsigned him to be patient.\n\n\"The quantity of diminution to be obtained bothered me considerably.\nExactly how small that other universe is, I had no means of knowing,\nexcept by the computations I made of the magnifying power of my lens.\nThese figures, I know, must necessarily be very inaccurate. Then, again,\nI have no means of judging by the visual rate of diminution of these\nrabbits, whether this contraction is at a uniform rate or accelerated.\nNor can I tell how long it is prolonged, for the quantity of drug\nadministered, as only a fraction of the diminution has taken place when\nthe animal passes beyond the range of any microscope I now possess.\n\n\"These questions were overshadowed, however, by a far more serious\nproblem that encompassed them all.\n\n\"As I was planning to project myself into this unknown universe and to\nreach the exact size proportionate to it, I soon realized such a result\ncould not be obtained were I in an unconscious state. Only by successive\ndoses of the drug, or its retardent about which I will tell you later,\ncould I hope to reach the proper size. Another necessity is that I place\nmyself on the exact spot on that ring where I wish to enter and to climb\ndown among its atoms when I have become sufficiently small to do so.\nObviously, this would be impossible to one not possessing all his\nfaculties and physical strength.\"\n\n\"And did you solve that problem, too?\" asked the Banker.\n\n\"I'd like to see it done,\" he added, reading his answer in the other's\nconfident smile.\n\nThe Chemist produced two small paper packages from his wallet. \"These\ndrugs are the result of my research,\" he said. \"One of them causes\ncontraction, and the other expansion, by an exact reversal of the\nprocess. Taken together, they produce no effect, and a lesser amount of\none retards the action of the other.\" He opened the papers, showing two\nsmall vials. \"I have made them as you see, in the form of tiny pills,\neach containing a minute quantity of the drug. It is by taking them\nsuccessively in unequal amounts that I expect to reach the desired\nsize.\"\n\n\"There's one point that you do not mention,\" said the Doctor. \"Those\nvials and their contents will have to change size as you do. How are you\ngoing to manage that?\"\n\n\"By experimentation I have found,\" answered the Chemist, \"that any\nobject held in close physical contact with the living body being\ncontracted is contracted itself at an equal rate. I believe that my\nclothes will be affected also. These vials I will carry strapped under\nmy armpits.\"\n\n\"Suppose you should die, or be killed, would the contraction cease?\"\nasked the Doctor.\n\n\"Yes, almost immediately,\" replied the Chemist. \"Apparently, though I am\nacting through the subconscious mind while its power is held in\nabeyance, when this power is permanently withdrawn by death, the drug no\nlonger affects the individual cells. The contraction or expansion ceases\nalmost at once.\"\n\nThe Chemist cleared a space before him on the table. \"In a well-managed\nclub like this,\" he said, \"there should be no flies, but I see several\naround. Do you suppose we can catch one of them?\"\n\n\"I can,\" said the Very Young Man, and forthwith he did.\n\nThe Chemist moistened a lump of sugar and laid it on the table before\nhim. Then, selecting one of the smallest of the pills, he ground it to\npowder with the back of a spoon and sprinkled this powder on the sugar.\n\n\"Will you give me the fly, please?\"\n\nThe Very Young Man gingerly did so. The Chemist held the insect by its\nwings over the sugar. \"Will someone lend me one of his shoes?\"\n\nThe Very Young Man hastily slipped off a dancing pump.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said the Chemist, placing it on the table with a quizzical\nsmile.\n\nThe rest of the company rose from their chairs and gathered around,\nwatching with interested faces what was about to happen.\n\n\"I hope he is hungry,\" remarked the Chemist, and placed the fly gently\ndown on the sugar, still holding it by the wings. The insect, after a\nmoment, ate a little.\n\nSilence fell upon the group as each watched intently. For a few moments\nnothing happened. Then, almost imperceptibly at first, the fly became\nlarger. In another minute it was the size of a large horse-fly,\nstruggling to release its wings from the Chemist's grasp. A minute more\nand it was the size of a beetle. No one spoke. The Banker moistened his\nlips, drained his glass hurriedly and moved slightly farther away. Still\nthe insect grew; now it was the size of a small chicken, the multiple\nlens of its eyes presenting a most terrifying aspect, while its\nferocious droning reverberated through the room. Then suddenly the\nChemist threw it upon the table, covered it with a napkin, and beat it\nviolently with the slipper. When all movement had ceased he tossed its\nquivering body into a corner of the room.\n\n\"Good God!\" ejaculated the Banker, as the white-faced men stared at each\nother. The quiet voice of the Chemist brought them back to themselves.\n\"That, gentlemen, you must understand, was only a fraction of the very\nfirst stage of growth. As you may have noticed, it was constantly\naccelerated. This acceleration attains a speed of possibly fifty\nthousand times that you observed. Beyond that, it is my theory, the\nchange is at a uniform rate.\" He looked at the body of the fly, lying\ninert on the floor. \"You can appreciate now, gentlemen, the importance\nof having this growth cease after death.\"\n\n\"Good Lord, I should say so!\" murmured the Big Business Man, mopping his\nforehead. The Chemist took the lump of sugar and threw it into the open\nfire.\n\n\"Gosh!\" said the Very Young Man, \"suppose when we were not looking,\nanother fly had----\"\n\n\"Shut up!\" growled the Banker.\n\n\"Not so skeptical now, eh, George?\" said the Big Business Man.\n\n\"Can you catch me another fly?\" asked the Chemist. The Very Young Man\nhastened to do so. \"The second demonstration, gentlemen,\" said the\nChemist, \"is less spectacular, but far more pertinent than the one you\nhave just witnessed.\" He took the fly by the wings, and prepared another\nlump of sugar, sprinkling a crushed pill from the other vial upon it.\n\n\"When he is small enough I am going to try to put him on the ring, if he\nwill stay still,\" said the Chemist.\n\nThe Doctor pulled the plate containing the ring forward until it was\ndirectly under the light, and every one crowded closer to watch; already\nthe fly was almost too small to be held. The Chemist tried to set it on\nthe ring, but could not; so with his other hand he brushed it lightly\ninto the plate, where it lay, a tiny black speck against the gleaming\nwhiteness of the china.\n\n\"Watch it carefully, gentlemen,\" he said, as they bent closer.\n\n\"It's gone,\" said the Big Business Man.\n\n\"No, I can still see it,\" said the Doctor. Then he raised the plate\ncloser to his face. \"Now it's gone,\" he said.\n\nThe Chemist sat down in his chair. \"It's probably still there, only too\nsmall for you to see. In a few minutes, if it took a sufficient amount\nof the drug, it will be small enough to fall between the molecules of\nthe plate.\"\n\n\"Do you suppose it will find another inhabited universe down there?\"\nasked the Very Young Man.\n\n\"Who knows,\" smiled the Chemist. \"Very possibly it will. But the one we\nare interested in is here,\" he added, touching the ring.\n\n\"Is it your intention to take this stuff yourself to-night?\" asked the\nBig Business Man.\n\n\"If you will give me your help, I think so, yes. I have made all\narrangements. The club has given us this room in absolute privacy for\nforty-eight hours. Your meals will be served here when you want them,\nand I am going to ask you, gentlemen, to take turns watching and\nguarding the ring during that time. Will you do it?\"\n\n\"I should say we would,\" cried the Doctor, and the others nodded assent.\n\n\"It is because I wanted you to be convinced of my entire sincerity that\nI have taken you so thoroughly into my confidence. Are those doors\nlocked?\" The Very Young Man locked them.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said the Chemist, starting to disrobe. In a moment he stood\nbefore them attired in a woolen bathing-suit of pure white. Over his\nshoulders was strapped tightly a narrow leather harness, supporting two\nsilken pockets, one under each armpit. Into each of these he placed one\nof the vials, first laying four pills from one of them upon the table.\n\nAt this point the Banker rose from his chair and selected another in the\nfurther corner of the room. He sank into it a crumpled heap and wiped\nthe beads of perspiration from his face with a shaking hand.\n\n\"I have every expectation,\" said the Chemist, \"that this suit and\nharness will contract in size uniformly with me. If the harness should\nnot, then I shall have to hold the vials in my hand.\"\n\nOn the table, directly under the light, he spread a large silk\nhandkerchief, upon which he placed the ring. He then produced a\nteaspoon, which he handed to the Doctor.\n\n\"Please listen carefully,\" he said, \"for perhaps the whole success of my\nadventure, and my life itself, may depend upon your actions during the\nnext few minutes. You will realize, of course, that when I am still\nlarge enough to be visible to you I shall be so small that my voice may\nbe inaudible. Therefore, I want you to know, now, just what to expect.\n\n\"When I am something under a foot high, I shall step upon that\nhandkerchief, where you will see my white suit plainly against its black\nsurface. When I become less than an inch high, I shall run over to the\nring and stand beside it. When I have diminished to about a quarter of\nan inch, I shall climb upon it, and, as I get smaller, will follow its\nsurface until I come to the scratch.\n\n\"I want you to watch me very closely. I may miscalculate the time and\nwait until I am too small to climb upon the ring. Or I may fall off. In\neither case, you will place that spoon beside me and I will climb into\nit. You will then do your best to help me get on the ring. Is all this\nquite clear?\"\n\nThe Doctor nodded assent.\n\n\"Very well, watch me as long as I remain visible. If I have an accident,\nI shall take the other drug and endeavor to return to you at once. This\nyou must expect at any moment during the next forty-eight hours. Under\nall circumstances, if I am alive, I shall return at the expiration of\nthat time.\n\n\"And, gentlemen, let me caution you most solemnly, do not allow that\nring to be touched until that length of time has expired. Can I depend\non you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" they answered breathlessly.\n\n\"After I have taken the pills,\" the Chemist continued, \"I shall not\nspeak unless it is absolutely necessary. I do not know what my\nsensations will be, and I want to follow them as closely as possible.\"\nHe then turned out all the lights in the room with the exception of the\ncenter electrolier, that shone down directly on the handkerchief and\nring.\n\nThe Chemist looked about him. \"Good-by, gentlemen,\" he said, shaking\nhands all round. \"Wish me luck,\" and without hesitation he placed the\nfour pills in his mouth and washed them down with a swallow of water.\n\nSilence fell on the group as the Chemist seated himself and covered his\nface with his hands. For perhaps two minutes the tenseness of the\nsilence was unbroken, save by the heavy breathing of the Banker as he\nlay huddled in his chair.\n\n\"Oh, my God! He _is_ growing smaller!\" whispered the Big Business Man in\na horrified tone to the Doctor. The Chemist raised his head and smiled\nat them. Then he stood up, steadying himself against a chair. He was\nless than four feet high. Steadily he grew smaller before their\nhorrified eyes. Once he made, as if to speak, and the Doctor knelt down\nbeside him. \"It's all right, good-by,\" he said in a tiny voice.\n\nThen he stepped upon the handkerchief. The Doctor knelt on the floor\nbeside it, the wooden spoon ready in his hand, while the others, except\nthe Banker, stood behind him. The figure of the Chemist, standing\nmotionless near the edge of the handkerchief, seemed now like a little\nwhite wooden toy, hardly more than an inch in height.\n\nWaving his hand and smiling, he suddenly started to walk and then ran\nswiftly over to the ring. By the time he reached it, somewhat out of\nbreath, he was little more than twice as high as the width of its band.\nWithout pausing, he leaped up, and sat astraddle, leaning over and\nholding to it tightly with his hands. In another moment he was on his\nfeet, on the upper edge of the ring, walking carefully along its\ncircumference towards the scratch.\n\nThe Big Business Man touched the Doctor on the shoulder and tried to\nsmile. \"He's making it,\" he whispered. As if in answer the little figure\nturned and waved its arms. They could just distinguish its white outline\nagainst the gold surface underneath.\n\n\"I don't see him,\" said the Very Young Man in a scared voice.\n\n\"He's right near the scratch,\" answered the Doctor, bending closer.\nThen, after a moment, \"He's gone.\" He rose to his feet. \"Good Lord! Why\nhaven't we a microscope!\"\n\n\"I never thought of that,\" said the Big Business Man, \"we could have\nwatched him for a long time yet.\"\n\n\"Well, he's gone now,\" returned the Doctor, \"and there is nothing for us\nto do but wait.\"\n\n\"I hope he finds that girl,\" sighed the Very Young Man, as he sat chin\nin hand beside the handkerchief.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nAFTER FORTY-EIGHT HOURS\n\n\nThe Banker snored stertorously from his mattress in a corner of the\nroom. In an easy-chair near by, with his feet on the table, lay the Very\nYoung Man, sleeping also.\n\nThe Doctor and the Big Business Man sat by the handkerchief conversing\nin low tones.\n\n\"How long has it been now?\" asked the latter.\n\n\"Just forty hours,\" answered the Doctor; \"and he said that forty-eight\nhours was the limit. He should come back at about ten to-night.\"\n\n\"I wonder if he _will_ come back,\" questioned the Big Business Man\nnervously. \"Lord, I wish _he_ wouldn't snore so loud,\" he added\nirritably, nodding in the direction of the Banker.\n\nThey were silent for a moment, and then he went on: \"You'd better try to\nsleep a little while, Frank. You're worn out. I'll watch here.\"\n\n\"I suppose I should,\" answered the Doctor wearily. \"Wake up that kid,\nhe's sleeping most of the time.\"\n\n\"No, I'll watch,\" repeated the Big Business Man. \"You lie down over\nthere.\"\n\nThe Doctor did so while the other settled himself more comfortably on a\ncushion beside the handkerchief, and prepared for his lonely watching.\n\nThe Doctor apparently dropped off to sleep at once, for he did not speak\nagain. The Big Business Man sat staring steadily at the ring, bending\nnearer to it occasionally. Every ten or fifteen minutes he looked at his\nwatch.\n\nPerhaps an hour passed in this way, when the Very Young Man suddenly sat\nup and yawned. \"Haven't they come back yet?\" he asked in a sleepy voice.\n\nThe Big Business Man answered in a much lower tone. \"What do you\nmean--they?\"\n\n\"I dreamed that he brought the girl back with him,\" said the Very Young\nMan.\n\n\"Well, if he did, they have not arrived. You'd better go back to sleep.\nWe've got six or seven hours yet--maybe more.\"\n\nThe Very Young Man rose and crossed the room. \"No, I'll watch a while,\"\nhe said, seating himself on the floor. \"What time is it?\"\n\n\"Quarter to three.\"\n\n\"He said he'd be back by ten to-night. I'm crazy to see that girl.\"\n\nThe Big Business Man rose and went over to a dinner-tray, standing near\nthe door. \"Lord, I'm hungry. I must have forgotten to eat to-day.\" He\nlifted up one of the silver covers. What he saw evidently encouraged\nhim, for he drew up a chair and began his lunch.\n\nThe Very Young Man lighted a cigarette. \"It will be the tragedy of my\nlife,\" he said, \"if he never comes back.\"\n\nThe Big Business Man smiled. \"How about _his_ life?\" he answered, but\nthe Very Young Man had fallen into a reverie and did not reply.\n\nThe Big Business Man finished his lunch in silence and was just about to\nlight a cigar when a sharp exclamation brought him hastily to his feet.\n\n\"Come here, quick, I see something.\" The Very Young Man had his face\nclose to the ring and was trembling violently.\n\nThe other pushed him back. \"Let me see. Where?\"\n\n\"There, by the scratch; he's lying there; I can see him.\"\n\nThe Big Business Man looked and then hurriedly woke the Doctor.\n\n\"He's come back,\" he said briefly; \"you can see him there.\" The Doctor\nbent down over the ring while the others woke up the Banker.\n\n\"He doesn't seem to be getting any bigger,\" said the Very Young Man;\n\"he's just lying there. Maybe he's dead.\"\n\n\"What shall we do?\" asked the Big Business Man, and made as if to pick\nup the ring. The Doctor shoved him away. \"Don't do that!\" he said\nsharply. \"Do you want to kill him?\"\n\n\"He's sitting up,\" cried the Very Young Man. \"He's all right.\"\n\n\"He must have fainted,\" said the Doctor. \"Probably he's taking more of\nthe drug now.\"\n\n\"He's much larger,\" said the Very Young Man; \"look at him!\"\n\nThe tiny figure was sitting sideways on the ring, with its feet hanging\nover the outer edge. It was growing perceptibly larger each instant, and\nin a moment it slipped down off the ring and sank in a heap on the\nhandkerchief.\n\n\"Good Heavens! Look at him!\" cried the Big Business Man. \"He's all\ncovered with blood.\"\n\nThe little figure presented a ghastly sight. As it steadily grew larger\nthey could see and recognize the Chemist's haggard face, his cheek and\nneck stained with blood, and his white suit covered with dirt.\n\n\"Look at his feet,\" whispered the Big Business Man. They were horribly\ncut and bruised and greatly swollen.\n\nThe Doctor bent over and whispered gently, \"What can I do to help you?\"\nThe Chemist shook his head. His body, lying prone upon the handkerchief,\nhad torn it apart in growing. When he was about twelve inches in length\nhe raised his head. The Doctor bent closer. \"Some brandy, please,\" said\na wraith of the Chemist's voice. It was barely audible.\n\n\"He wants some brandy,\" called the Doctor. The Very Young Man looked\nhastily around, then opened the door and dashed madly out of the room.\nWhen he returned, the Chemist had grown to nearly four feet. He was\nsitting on the floor with his back against the Doctor's knees. The Big\nBusiness Man was wiping the blood off his face with a damp napkin.\n\n\"Here!\" cried the Very Young Man, thrusting forth the brandy. The\nChemist drank a little of it. Then he sat up, evidently somewhat\nrevived.\n\n\"I seem to have stopped growing,\" he said. \"Let's finish it up now. God!\nhow I want to be the right size again,\" he added fervently.\n\nThe Doctor helped him extract the vials from under his arm, and the\nChemist touched one of the pills to his tongue. Then he sank back,\nclosing his eyes. \"I think that should be about enough,\" he murmured.\n\nNo one spoke for nearly ten minutes. Gradually the Chemist's body grew,\nthe Doctor shifting his position several times as it became larger. It\nseemed finally to have stopped growing, and was apparently nearly its\nformer size.\n\n\"Is he asleep?\" whispered the Very Young Man.\n\nThe Chemist opened his eyes.\n\n\"No,\" he answered. \"I'm all right now, I think.\" He rose to his feet,\nthe Doctor and the Big Business Man supporting him on either side.\n\n\"Sit down and tell us about it,\" said the Very Young Man. \"Did you find\nthe girl?\"\n\nThe Chemist smiled wearily.\n\n\"Gentlemen, I cannot talk now. Let me have a bath and some dinner. Then\nI will tell you all about it.\"\n\nThe Doctor rang for an attendant, and led the Chemist to the door,\nthrowing a blanket around him as he did so. In the doorway the Chemist\npaused and looked back with a wan smile over the wreck of the room.\n\n\"Give me an hour,\" he said. \"And eat something yourselves while I am\ngone.\" Then he left, closing the door after him.\n\nWhen he returned, fully dressed in clothes that were ludicrously large\nfor him, the room had been straightened up, and his four friends were\nfinishing their meal. He took his place among them quietly and lighted a\ncigar.\n\n\"Well, gentlemen, I suppose that you are interested to hear what\nhappened to me,\" he began. The Very Young Man asked his usual question.\n\n\"Let him alone,\" said the Doctor. \"You will hear it all soon enough.\"\n\n\"Was it all as you expected?\" asked the Banker. It was his first remark\nsince the Chemist returned.\n\n\"To a great extent, yes,\" answered the Chemist. \"But I had better tell\nyou just what happened.\" The Very Young Man nodded his eager agreement.\n\n\"When I took those first four pills,\" began the Chemist in a quiet, even\ntone, \"my immediate sensation was a sudden reeling of the senses,\ncombined with an extreme nausea. This latter feeling passed after a\nmoment.\n\n\"You will remember that I seated myself upon the floor and closed my\neyes. When I opened them my head had steadied itself somewhat, but I was\noppressed by a curious feeling of drowsiness, impossible to shake off.\n\n\"My first mental impression was one of wonderment when I saw you all\nbegin to increase in size. I remember standing up beside that chair,\nwhich was then half again its normal size, and you\"--indicating the\nDoctor--\"towered beside me as a giant of nine or ten feet high.\n\n\"Steadily upward, with a curious crawling motion, grew the room and all\nits contents. Except for the feeling of sleep that oppressed me, I felt\nquite my usual self. No change appeared happening to me, but everything\nelse seemed growing to gigantic and terrifying proportions.\n\n\"Can you imagine a human being a hundred feet high? That is how you\nlooked to me as I stepped upon that huge expanse of black silk and\nshouted my last good-bye to you!\n\n\"Over to my left lay the ring, apparently fifteen or twenty feet away. I\nstarted to walk towards it, but although it grew rapidly larger, the\ndistance separating me from it seemed to increase rather than lessen.\nThen I ran, and by the time I arrived it stood higher than my waist--a\nbeautiful, shaggy, golden pit.\n\n\"I jumped upon its rim and clung to it tightly. I could feel it growing\nbeneath me, as I sat. After a moment I climbed upon its top surface and\nstarted to walk towards the point where I knew the scratch to be.\n\n\"I found myself now, as I looked about, walking upon a narrow, though\never broadening, curved path. The ground beneath my feet appeared to be\na rough, yellowish quartz. This path grew rougher as I advanced. Below\nthe bulging edges of the path, on both sides, lay a shining black plain,\nridged and indented, and with a sunlike sheen on the higher portions of\nthe ridges. On the one hand this black plain stretched in an unbroken\nexpanse to the horizon. On the other, it appeared as a circular valley,\nenclosed by a shining yellow wall.\n\n\"The way had now become extraordinarily rough. I bore to the left as I\nadvanced, keeping close to the outer edge. The other edge of the path I\ncould not see. I clambered along hastily, and after a few moments was\nconfronted by a row of rocks and bowlders lying directly across my line\nof progress. I followed their course for a short distance, and finally\nfound a space through which I could pass.\n\n\"This transverse ridge was perhaps a hundred feet deep. Behind it and\nextending in a parallel direction lay a tremendous valley. I knew then I\nhad reached my first objective.\n\n\"I sat down upon the brink of the precipice and watched the cavern\ngrowing ever wider and deeper. Then I realized that I must begin my\ndescent if ever I was to reach the bottom. For perhaps six hours I\nclimbed steadily downwards. It was a fairly easy descent after the first\nlittle while, for the ground seemed to open up before me as I advanced,\nchanging its contour so constantly that I was never at a loss for an\neasy downward path.\n\n\"My feet suffered cruelly from the shaggy, metallic ground, and I soon\nhad to stop and rig a sort of protection for the soles of them from a\nportion of the harness over my shoulder. According to the stature I was\nwhen I reached the bottom, I had descended perhaps twelve thousand feet\nduring this time.\n\n\"The latter part of the journey found me nearing the bottom of the\nca\u00f1on. Objects around me no longer seemed to increase in size, as had\nbeen constantly the case before, and I reasoned that probably my stature\nwas remaining constant.\n\n\"I noticed, too, as I advanced, a curious alteration in the form of\nlight around me. The glare from above (the sky showed only as a narrow\ndull ribbon of blue) barely penetrated to the depths of the ca\u00f1on's\nfloor. But all about me there was a soft radiance, seeming to emanate\nfrom the rocks themselves.\n\n\"The sides of the ca\u00f1on were shaggy and rough, beyond anything I had\never seen. Huge bowlders, hundreds of feet in diameter, were embedded in\nthem. The bottom also was strewn with similar gigantic rocks.\n\n\"I surveyed this lonely waste for some time in dismay, not knowing in\nwhat direction lay my goal. I knew that I was at the bottom of the\nscratch, and by the comparison of its size I realized I was well started\non my journey.\n\n\"I have not told you, gentlemen, that at the time I marked the ring I\nmade a deeper indentation in one portion of the scratch and focused the\nmicroscope upon that. This indentation I now searched for. Luckily I\nfound it, less than half a mile away--an almost circular pit, perhaps\nfive miles in diameter, with shining walls extending downwards into\nblackness. There seemed no possible way of descending into it, so I sat\ndown near its edge to think out my plan of action.\n\n\"I realized now that I was faint and hungry, and whatever I did must be\ndone quickly. I could turn back to you, or I could go on. I decided to\nrisk the latter course, and took twelve more of the pills--three times\nmy original dose.\"\n\nThe Chemist paused for a moment, but his auditors were much too intent\nto question him. Then he resumed in his former matter-of-fact tone.\n\n\"After my vertigo had passed somewhat--it was much more severe this\ntime--I looked up and found my surroundings growing at a far more rapid\nrate than before. I staggered to the edge of the pit. It was opening up\nand widening out at an astounding rate. Already its sides were becoming\nrough and broken, and I saw many places where a descent would be\npossible.\n\n\"The feeling of sleep that had formerly merely oppressed me, combined\nnow with my physical fatigue and the larger dose of the drug I had\ntaken, became almost intolerable. I yielded to it for a moment, lying\ndown on a crag near the edge of the pit. I must have become almost\nimmediately unconscious, and remained so for a considerable time. I can\nremember a horrible sensation of sliding headlong for what seemed like\nhours. I felt that I was sliding or falling downward. I tried to rouse\nbut could not. Then came absolute oblivion.\n\n\"When I recovered my senses I was lying partly covered by a mass of\nsmooth, shining pebbles. I was bruised and battered from head to\nfoot--in a far worse condition than you first saw me when I returned.\n\n\"I sat up and looked around. Beside me, sloped upward at an apparently\nincreasing angle a tremendous glossy plane. This extended, as far as I\ncould see, both to the right and left and upward into the blackness of\nthe sky overhead. It was this plane that had evidently broken my fall,\nand I had been sliding down it, bringing with me a considerable mass of\nrocks and bowlders.\n\n\"As my senses became clearer I saw I was lying on a fairly level floor.\nI could see perhaps two miles in each direction. Beyond that there was\nonly darkness. The sky overhead was unbroken by stars or light of any\nkind. I should have been in total darkness except, as I have told you\nbefore, that everything, even the blackness itself, seemed to be\nself-luminous.\n\n\"The incline down which I had fallen was composed of some smooth\nsubstance suggesting black marble. The floor underfoot was quite\ndifferent--more of a metallic quality with a curious corrugation. Before\nme, in the dim distance, I could just make out a tiny range of hills.\n\n\"I rose, after a time, and started weakly to walk towards these hills.\nThough I was faint and dizzy from my fall and the lack of food, I walked\nfor perhaps half an hour, following closely the edge of the incline. No\nchange in my visual surroundings occurred, except that I seemed\ngradually to be approaching the line of hills. My situation at this\ntime, as I turned it over in my mind, appeared hopelessly desperate, and\nI admit I neither expected to reach my destination nor to be able to\nreturn to my own world.\n\n\"A sudden change in the feeling of the ground underfoot brought me to\nmyself; I bent down and found I was treading on vegetation--a tiny\nforest extending for quite a distance in front and to the side of me. A\nfew steps ahead a little silver ribbon threaded its way through the\ntrees. This I judged to be water.\n\n\"New hope possessed me at this discovery. I sat down at once and took a\nportion of another of the pills.\n\n\"I must again have fallen asleep. When I awoke, somewhat refreshed, I\nfound myself lying beside the huge trunk of a fallen tree. I was in what\nhad evidently once been a deep forest, but which now was almost utterly\ndesolated. Only here and there were the trees left standing. For the\nmost part they were lying in a crushed and tangled mass, many of them\npartially embedded in the ground.\n\n\"I cannot express adequately to you, gentlemen, what an evidence of\ntremendous superhuman power this scene presented. No storm, no\nlightning, nor any attack of the elements could have produced more than\na fraction of the destruction I saw all around me.\n\n\"I climbed cautiously upon the fallen tree-trunk, and from this\nelevation had a much better view of my surroundings. I appeared to be\nnear one end of the desolated area, which extended in a path about half\na mile wide and several miles deep. In front, a thousand feet away,\nperhaps, lay the unbroken forest.\n\n\"Descending from the tree-trunk I walked in this direction, reaching the\nedge of the woods after possibly an hour of the most arduous traveling\nof my whole journey.\n\n\"During this time almost my only thought was the necessity of obtaining\nfood. I looked about me as I advanced, and on one of the fallen\ntree-trunks I found a sort of vine growing. This vine bore a profusion\nof small gray berries, much like our huckleberries. They proved similar\nin taste, and I sat down and ate a quantity.\n\n\"When I reached the edge of the forest I felt somewhat stronger. I had\nseen up to this time no sign of animal life whatever. Now, as I stood\nsilent, I could hear around me all the multitudinous tiny voices of the\nwoods. Insect life stirred underfoot, and in the trees above an\noccasional bird flitted to and fro.\n\n\"Perhaps I am giving you a picture of our own world. I do not mean to do\nso. You must remember that above me there was no sky, just blackness.\nAnd yet so much light illuminated the scene that I could not believe it\nwas other than what we would call daytime. Objects in the forest were as\nwell lighted--better probably than they would be under similar\ncircumstances in our own world.\n\n\"The trees were of huge size compared to my present stature; straight,\nupstanding trunks, with no branches until very near the top. They were\nbluish-gray in color, and many of them well covered with the berry-vine\nI have mentioned. The leaves overhead seemed to be blue--in fact the\npredominating color of all the vegetation was blue, just as in our world\nit is green. The ground was covered with dead leaves, mould, and a sort\nof gray moss. Fungus of a similar color appeared, but of this I did not\neat.\n\n\"I had penetrated perhaps two miles into the forest when I came\nunexpectedly to the bank of a broad, smooth-flowing river, its silver\nsurface seeming to radiate waves of the characteristic phosphorescent\nlight. I found it cold, pure-tasting water, and I drank long and deeply.\nThen I remember lying down upon the mossy bank, and in a moment, utterly\nworn out, I again fell asleep.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nLYLDA\n\n\n\"I was awakened by the feel of soft hands upon my head and face. With a\nstart I sat up abruptly; I rubbed my eyes confusedly for a moment, not\nknowing where I was. When I collected my wits I found myself staring\ninto the face of a girl, who was kneeling on the ground before me. I\nrecognized her at once--she was the girl of the microscope.\n\n\"To say I was startled would be to put it mildly, but I read no fear in\nher expression, only wonderment at my springing so suddenly into life.\nShe was dressed very much as I had seen her before. Her fragile beauty\nwas the same, and at this closer view infinitely more appealing, but I\nwas puzzled to account for her older, more mature look. She seemed to\nhave aged several years since the last evening I had seen her through\nthe microscope. Yet, undeniably, it was the same girl.\n\n\"For some moments we sat looking at each other in wonderment. Then she\nsmiled and held out her hand, palm up, speaking a few words as she did\nso. Her voice was soft and musical, and the words of a peculiar quality\nthat we generally describe as liquid, for want of a better term. What\nshe said was wholly unintelligible, but whether the words were strange\nor the intonation different from anything I had ever heard I could not\ndetermine.\n\n\"Afterwards, during my stay in this other world, I found that the\nlanguage of its people resembled English quite closely, so far as the\nwords themselves went. But the intonation with which they were given,\nand the gestures accompanying them, differed so widely from our own that\nthey conveyed no meaning.\n\n\"The gap separating us, however, was very much less than you would\nimagine. Strangely enough, though, it was not I who learned to speak her\ntongue, but she who mastered mine.\"\n\nThe Very Young Man sighed contentedly.\n\n\"We became quite friendly after this greeting,\" resumed the Chemist,\n\"and it was apparent from her manner that she had already conceived her\nown idea of who and what I was.\n\n\"For some time we sat and tried to communicate with each other. My words\nseemed almost as unintelligible to her as hers to me, except that\noccasionally she would divine my meaning, clapping her hands in childish\ndelight. I made out that she lived at a considerable distance, and that\nher name was Lylda. Finally she pulled me by the hand and led me away\nwith a proprietary air that amused and, I must admit, pleased me\ntremendously.\n\n\"We had progressed through the woods in this way, hardly more than a few\nhundred yards, when suddenly I found that she was taking me into the\nmouth of a cave or passageway, sloping downward at an angle of perhaps\ntwenty degrees. I noticed now, more graphically than ever before, a\ntruth that had been gradually forcing itself upon me. Darkness was\nimpossible in this new world. We were now shut in between narrow walls\nof crystalline rock, with a roof hardly more than fifty feet above.\n\n\"No artificial light of any kind was in evidence, yet the scene was\nlighted quite brightly. This, I have explained, was caused by the\nphosphorescent radiation that apparently emanated from every particle of\nmineral matter in this universe.\n\n\"As we advanced, many other tunnels crossed the one we were traveling.\nAnd now, occasionally, we passed other people, the men dressed similarly\nto Lylda, but wearing their hair chopped off just above the shoulder\nline.\n\n\"Later, I found that the men were generally about five and a half feet\nin stature: lean, muscular, and with a grayer, harder look to their skin\nthan the iridescent quality that characterized the women.\n\n\"They were fine-looking chaps these we encountered. All of them stared\ncuriously at me, and several times we were held up by chattering groups.\nThe intense whiteness of my skin, for it looked in this light the color\nof chalk, seemed to both awe and amuse them. But they treated me with\ngreat deference and respect, which I afterwards learned was because of\nLylda herself, and also what she told them about me.\n\n\"At several of the intersections of the tunnels there were wide open\nspaces. One of these we now approached. It was a vast amphitheater, so\nbroad its opposite wall was invisible, and it seemed crowded with\npeople. At the side, on a rocky niche in the wall, a speaker harangued\nthe crowd.\n\n\"We skirted the edge of this crowd and plunged into another passageway,\nsloping downward still more steeply. I was so much interested in the\nstrange scenes opening before me that I remarked little of the distance\nwe traveled. Nor did I question Lylda but seldom. I was absorbed in the\ncomplete similarity between this and my own world in its general\ncharacteristics, and yet its complete strangeness in details.\n\n\"I felt not the slightest fear. Indeed the sincerity and kindliness of\nthese people seemed absolutely genuine, and the friendly, na\u00efve, manner\nof my little guide put me wholly at my ease. Towards me Lylda's manner\nwas one of childish delight at a new-found possession. Towards those of\nher own people with whom we talked, I found she preserved a dignity they\nprofoundly respected.\n\n\"We had hardly more than entered this last tunnel when I heard the sound\nof drums and a weird sort of piping music, followed by shouts and\ncheers. Figures from behind us scurried past, hastening towards the\nsound. Lylda's clasp on my hand tightened, and she pulled me forward\neagerly. As we advanced the crowd became denser, pushing and shoving us\nabout and paying little attention to me.\n\n\"In close contact with these people I soon found I was stronger than\nthey, and for a time I had no difficulty in shoving them aside and\nopening a path for us. They took my rough handling in all good part, in\nfact, never have I met a more even-tempered, good-natured people than\nthese.\n\n\"After a time the crowd became so dense we could advance no further. At\nthis Lylda signed me to bear to the side. As we approached the wall of\nthe cavern she suddenly clasped her hands high over her head and shouted\nsomething in a clear, commanding voice. Instantly the crowd fell back,\nand in a moment I found myself being pulled up a narrow flight of stone\nsteps in the wall and out upon a level space some twenty feet above the\nheads of the people.\n\n\"Several dignitaries occupied this platform. Lylda greeted them quietly,\nand they made place for us beside the parapet. I could see now that we\nwere at the intersection of a transverse passageway, much broader than\nthe one we had been traversing. And now I received the greatest surprise\nI had had in this new world, for down this latter tunnel was passing a\nbroad line of men who obviously were soldiers.\n\n\"The uniformly straight lines they held; the glint of light on the\nspears they carried upright before them; the weird, but rhythmic, music\nthat passed at intervals, with which they kept step; and, above all, the\ncheering enthusiasm of the crowd, all seemed like an echo of my own\ngreat world above.\n\n\"This martial ardor and what it implied came as a distinct shock. All I\nhad seen before showed the gentle kindliness of a people whose life\nseemed far removed from the struggle for existence to which our race is\nsubjected. I had come gradually to feel that this new world, at least,\nhad attained the golden age of security, and that fear, hate, and\nwrongdoing had long since passed away, or had never been born.\n\n\"Yet, here before my very eyes, made wholesome by the fires of\npatriotism, stalked the grim God of War. Knowing nothing yet of the\nmotive that inspired these people, I could feel no enthusiasm, but only\ndisillusionment at this discovery of the omnipotence of strife.\n\n\"For some time I must have stood in silence. Lylda, too, seemed to\ndivine my thoughts, for she did not applaud, but pensively watched the\ncheering throng below. All at once, with an impulsively appealing\nmovement, she pulled me down towards her, and pressed her pretty cheek\nto mine. It seemed almost as if she was asking me to help.\n\n\"The line of marching men seemed now to have passed, and the crowd\nsurged over into the open space and began to disperse. As the men upon\nthe platform with us prepared to leave, Lylda led me over to one of\nthem. He was nearly as tall as I, and dressed in the characteristic\ntunic that seemed universally worn by both sexes. The upper part of his\nbody was hung with beads, and across his chest was a thin, slightly\nconvex stone plate.\n\n\"After a few words of explanation from Lylda, he laid his hands on my\nshoulders near the base of the neck, smiling with his words of greeting.\nThen he held one hand before me, palm up, as Lylda had done, and I laid\nmine in it, which seemed the correct thing to do.\n\n\"I repeated this performance with two others who joined us, and then\nLylda pulled me away. We descended the steps and turned into the broader\ntunnel, finding near at hand a sort of sleigh, which Lylda signed me to\nenter. It was constructed evidently of wood, with a pile of leaves, or\nsimilar dead vegetation, for cushions. It was balanced upon a single\nrunner of polished stone, about two feet broad, with a narrow, slightly\nshorter outrider on each side.\n\n\"Harnessed to the shaft were two animals, more resembling our reindeers\nthan anything else, except that they were gray in color and had no\nhorns. An attendant greeted Lylda respectfully as we approached, and\nmounted a seat in front of us when we were comfortably settled.\n\n\"We drove in this curious vehicle for over an hour. The floor of the\ntunnel was quite smooth, and we glided down its incline with little\neffort and at a good rate. Our driver preserved the balance of the\nsleigh by shifting his body from side to side so that only at rare\nintervals did the siderunners touch the ground.\n\n\"Finally, we emerged into the open, and I found myself viewing a scene\nof almost normal, earthly aspect. We were near the shore of a smooth,\nshining lake. At the side a broad stretch of rolling country, dotted\nhere and there with trees, was visible. Near at hand, on the lake shore,\nI saw a collection of houses, most of them low and flat, with one much\nlarger on a promontory near the lake.\n\n\"Overhead arched a gray-blue, cloudless sky, faintly star-studded, and\nreflected in the lake before me I saw that familiar gleaming trail of\nstar-dust, hanging like a huge straightened rainbow overhead, and ending\nat my feet.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nTHE WORLD IN THE RING\n\n\nThe Chemist paused and relighted his cigar. \"Perhaps you have some\nquestions,\" he suggested.\n\nThe Doctor shifted in his chair.\n\n\"Did you have any theory at this time\"--he wanted to know--\"about the\nphysical conformation of this world? What I mean is, when you came out\nof this tunnel were you on the inside or the outside of the world?\"\n\n\"Was it the same sky you saw overhead when you were in the forest?\"\nasked the Big Business Man.\n\n\"No, it was what he saw in the microscope, wasn't it?\" said the Very\nYoung Man.\n\n\"One at a time, gentlemen,\" laughed the Chemist. \"No, I had no\nparticular theory at this time--I had too many other things to think of.\nBut I do remember noticing one thing which gave me the clew to a fairly\ncomplete understanding of this universe. From it I formed a definite\nexplanation, which I found was the belief held by the people\nthemselves.\"\n\n\"What was that?\" asked the Very Young Man.\n\n\"I noticed, as I stood looking over this broad expanse of country before\nme, one vital thing that made it different from any similar scene I had\never beheld. If you will stop and think a moment, gentlemen, you will\nrealize that in our world here the horizon is caused by a curvature of\nthe earth below the straight line of vision. We are on a convex surface.\nBut as I gazed over this landscape, and even with no appreciable light\nfrom the sky I could see a distance of several miles, I saw at once that\nquite the reverse was true. I seemed to be standing in the center of a\nvast shallow bowl. The ground curved upward into the distance. There was\nno distant horizon line, only the gradual fading into shadow of the\nvisual landscape. I was standing obviously on a concave surface, on the\ninside, not the outside of the world.\n\n\"The situation, as I now understand it, was this: According to the\nsmallest stature I reached, and calling my height at that time roughly\nsix feet, I had descended into the ring at the time I met Lylda several\nthousand miles, at least. By the way, where is the ring?\"\n\n\"Here is it,\" said the Very Young Man, handing it to him. The Chemist\nreplaced it on his finger. \"It's pretty important to me now,\" he said,\nsmiling.\n\n\"You bet!\" agreed the Very Young Man.\n\n\"You can readily understand how I descended such a distance, if you\nconsider the comparative immensity of my stature during the first few\nhours I was in the ring. It is my understanding that this country\nthrough which I passed is a barren waste--merely the atoms of the\nmineral we call gold.\n\n\"Beyond that I entered the hitherto unexplored regions within the atom.\nThe country at that point where I found the forest, I was told later, is\nhabitable for several hundred miles. Around it on all sides lies a\ndesert, across which no one has ever penetrated.\n\n\"This surface is the outside of the Oroid world, for so they call their\nearth. At this point the shell between the outer and inner surface is\nonly a few miles in thickness. The two surfaces do not parallel each\nother here, so that in descending these tunnels we turned hardly more\nthan an eighth of a complete circle.\n\n\"At the city of Arite, where Lylda first took me, and where I had my\nfirst view of the inner surface, the curvature is slightly greater than\nthat of our own earth, although, as I have said, in the opposite\ndirection.\"\n\n\"And the space within this curvature--the heavens you have\nmentioned--how great do you estimate it to be?\" asked the Doctor.\n\n\"Based on the curvature at Arite it would be about six thousand miles in\ndiameter.\"\n\n\"Has this entire inner surface been explored?\" asked the Big Business\nMan.\n\n\"No, only a small portion. The Oroids are not an adventurous people.\nThere are only two nations, less than twelve million people all\ntogether, on a surface nearly as extensive as our own.\"\n\n\"How about those stars?\" suggested the Very Young Man.\n\n\"I believe they comprise a complete universe similar to our own solar\nsystem. There is a central sun-star, around which many of the others\nrevolve. You must understand, though, that these other worlds are\ninfinitely tiny compared to the Oroids, and, if inhabited, support\nbeings nearly as much smaller than the Oroids, as they are smaller than\nyou.\"\n\n\"Great Caesar!\" ejaculated the Banker. \"Don't let's go into that any\ndeeper!\"\n\n\"Tell us more about Lylda,\" prompted the Very Young Man.\n\n\"You are insatiable on that point,\" laughed the Chemist. \"Well, when we\nleft the sleigh, Lylda took me directly into the city of Arite. I found\nit an orderly collection of low houses, seemingly built of uniformly\ncut, highly polished gray blocks. As we passed through the streets, some\nof which were paved with similar blocks, I was reminded of nothing so\nmuch as the old jingles of Spotless Town. Everything was immaculately,\ninordinately clean. Indeed, the whole city seemed built of some curious\nform of opaque glass, newly scrubbed and polished.\n\n\"Children crowded from the doorways as we advanced, but Lylda dispersed\nthem with a gentle though firm, command. As we approached the sort of\ncastle I have mentioned, the reason for Lylda's authoritative manner\ndawned upon me. She was, I soon learned, daughter of one of the most\nlearned men of the nation and was--handmaiden, do you call it?--to the\nqueen.\"\n\n\"So it was a monarchy?\" interrupted the Big Business Man. \"I should\nnever have thought that.\"\n\n\"Lylda called their leader a king. In reality he was the president,\nchosen by the people, for a period of about what we would term twenty\nyears; I learned something about this republic during my stay, but not\nas much as I would have liked. Politics was not Lylda's strong point,\nand I had to get it all from her, you know.\n\n\"For several days I was housed royally in the castle. Food was served me\nby an attendant who evidently was assigned solely to look after my\nneeds. At first I was terribly confused by the constant, uniform light,\nbut when I found certain hours set aside for sleep, just as we have\nthem, when I began to eat regularly, I soon fell into the routine of\nthis new life.\n\n\"The food was not greatly different from our own, although I found not a\nsingle article I could identify. It consisted principally of vegetables\nand fruits, the latter of an apparently inexhaustible variety.\n\n\"Lylda visited me at intervals, and I learned I was awaiting an audience\nwith the king. During these days she made rapid progress with my\nlanguage--so rapid that I shortly gave up the idea of mastering hers.\n\n\"And now, with the growing intimacy between us and our ability to\ncommunicate more readily, I learned the simple, tragic story of her\nrace--new details, of course, but the old, old tale of might against\nright, and the tragedy of a trusting, kindly people, blindly thinking\nothers as just as themselves.\n\n\"For thousands of years, since the master life-giver had come from one\nof the stars to populate the world, the Oroid nation had dwelt in peace\nand security. These people cared nothing for adventure. No restless\nthirst for knowledge led them to explore deeply the limitless land\nsurrounding them. Even from the earliest times no struggle for\nexistence, no doctrine of the survival of the fittest, hung over them as\nwith us. No wild animals harassed them; no savages menaced them. A\nfertile boundless land, a perfect climate, nurtured them tenderly.\n\n\"Under such conditions they developed only the softer, gentler qualities\nof nature. Many laws among them were unnecessary, for life was so\nsimple, so pleasant to live, and the attainment of all the commonly\naccepted standards of wealth so easy, that the incentive to wrongdoing\nwas almost non-existent.\n\n\"Strangely enough, and fortunately, too, no individuals rose among them\nwith the desire for power. Those in command were respected and loved as\ntrue workers for the people, and they accepted their authority in the\nsame spirit with which it was given. Indolence, in its highest sense the\nwonderful art of doing nothing gracefully, played the greatest part in\ntheir life.\n\n\"Then, after centuries of ease and peaceful security, came the\nawakening. Almost without warning another nation had come out of the\nunknown to attack them.\n\n\"With the hurt feeling that comes to a child unjustly treated, they all\nbut succumbed to this first onslaught. The abduction of numbers of their\nwomen, for such seemed the principal purpose of the invaders, aroused\nthem sufficiently to repel this first crude attack. Their manhood\nchallenged, their anger as a nation awakened for the first time, they\nsprang as one man into the horror we call war.\n\n\"With the defeat of the Malites came another period of ease and\nsecurity. They had learned no lesson, but went their indolent way,\nplaying through life like the kindly children they were. During this\nlast period some intercourse between them and the Malites took place.\nThe latter people, whose origin was probably nearly opposite them on the\ninner surface, had by degrees pushed their frontiers closer and closer\nto the Oroids. Trade between the two was carried on to some extent, but\nthe character of the Malites, their instinctive desire for power, for\nits own sake, their consideration for themselves as superior beings,\ncaused them to be distrusted and feared by their more simple-minded\ncompanion nation.\n\n\"You can almost guess the rest, gentlemen. Lylda told me little about\nthe Malites, but the loathing disgust of her manner, her hesitancy, even\nto bring herself to mention them, spoke more eloquently than words.\n\n\"Four years ago, as they measure time, came the second attack, and now,\nin a huge arc, only a few hundred miles from Arite, hung the opposing\narmies.\"\n\nThe Chemist paused. \"That's the condition I found, gentlemen,\" he said.\n\"Not a strikingly original or unfamiliar situation, was it?\"\n\n\"By Jove!\" remarked the Doctor thoughtfully, \"what a curious thing that\nthe environment of our earth should so affect that world inside the\nring. It does make you stop and think, doesn't it, to realize how those\ninfinitesimal creatures are actuated now by the identical motives that\ninspire us?\"\n\n\"Yet it does seem very reasonable, I should say,\" the Big Business Man\nput in.\n\n\"Let's have another round of drinks,\" suggested the Banker--\"this is dry\nwork!\"\n\n\"As a scientist you'd make a magnificent plumber, George!\" retorted the\nBig Business Man. \"You're about as helpful in this little gathering as\nan oyster!\"\n\nThe Very Young Man rang for a waiter.\n\n\"I've been thinking----\" began the Banker, and stopped at the smile of\nhis companion. \"Shut up!\"--he finished--\"that's cheap wit, you know!\"\n\n\"Go on, George,\" encouraged the other, \"you've been thinking----\"\n\n\"I've been tremendously interested in this extraordinary story\"--he\naddressed himself to the Chemist--\"but there's one point I don't get at\nall. How many days were you in that ring do you make out?\"\n\n\"I believe about seven, all told,\" returned the Chemist.\n\n\"But you were only away from us some forty hours. I ought to know, I've\nbeen right here.\" He looked at his crumpled clothes somewhat ruefully.\n\n\"The change of time-progress was one of the surprises of my adventure,\"\nsaid the Chemist. \"It is easily explained in a general way, although I\ncannot even attempt a scientific theory of its cause. But I must confess\nthat before I started the possibility of such a thing never even\noccurred to me.\"\n\n\"To get a conception of this change you must analyze definitely what\ntime is. We measure and mark it by years, months, and so forth, down to\nminutes and seconds, all based upon the movements of our earth around\nits sun. But that is the measurement of time, not time itself. How would\nyou describe time?\"\n\nThe Big Business Man smiled. \"Time,\" he said, \"is what keeps everything\nfrom happening at once.\"\n\n\"Very clever,\" laughed the Chemist.\n\nThe Doctor leaned forward earnestly. \"I should say,\" he began, \"that\ntime is the rate at which we live--the speed at which we successively\npass through our existence from birth to death. It's very hard to put\nintelligibly, but I think I know what I mean,\" he finished somewhat\nlamely.\n\n\"Exactly so. Time is a rate of life-progress, different for every\nindividual and only made standard because we take the time-duration of\nthe earth's revolution around the sun, which is constant, and\narbitrarily say: 'That is thirty-one million five hundred thousand odd\nseconds.'\"\n\n\"Is time different for every individual?\" asked the Banker\nargumentatively.\n\n\"Think a moment,\" returned the Chemist. \"Suppose your brain were to work\ntwice as fast as mine. Suppose your heart beat twice as fast, and all\nthe functions of your body were accelerated in a like manner. What we\ncall a second would certainly seem to you twice as long. Further than\nthat, it actually would be twice as long, so far as you were concerned.\nYour digestion, instead of taking perhaps four hours, would take two.\nYou would eat twice as often. The desire for sleep would overtake you\nevery twelve hours instead of twenty-four, and you would be satisfied\nwith four hours of unconsciousness instead of eight. In short, you would\nsoon be living a cycle of two days every twenty-four hours. Time then,\nas we measure it, for you at least would have doubled--you would be\nprogressing through life at twice the rate that I am through mine.\"\n\n\"That may be theoretically true,\" the Big Business Man put in.\n\"Practically, though, it has never happened to any one.\"\n\n\"Of course not, to such a great degree as the instance I put. No one,\nexcept in disease, has ever doubled our average rate of life-progress,\nand lived it out as a balanced, otherwise normal existence. But there is\nno question that to some much smaller degree we all of us differ one\nfrom the other. The difference, however, is so comparatively slight,\nthat we can each one reconcile it to the standard measurement of time.\nAnd so, outwardly, time is the same for all of us. But inwardly, why, we\nnone of us conceive a minute or an hour to be the same! How do you know\nhow long a minute is to me? More than that, time is not constant even in\nthe same individual. How many hours are shorter to you than others? How\nmany days have been almost interminable? No, instead of being constant,\nthere is nothing more inconstant than time.\"\n\n\"Haven't you confused two different issues?\" suggested the Big Business\nMan. \"Granted what you say about the slightly different rate at which\ndifferent individuals live, isn't it quite another thing, how long time\nseems to you. A day when you have nothing to do seems long, or, on the\nother hand, if you are very busy it seems short. But mind, it only\n_seems_ short or long, according to the preoccupation of your mind. That\nhas nothing to do with the speed of your progress through life.\"\n\n\"Ah, but I think it has,\" cried the Chemist. \"You forget that we none of\nus have all of the one thing to the exclusion of the other. Time seems\nshort; it seems long, and in the end it all averages up, and makes our\nrate of progress what it is. Now if any of us were to go through life in\na calm, deliberate way, making time seem as long as possible, he would\nlive more years, as we measure them, than if he rushed headlong through\nthe days, accomplishing always as much as possible. I mean in neither\ncase to go to the extremes, but only so far as would be consistent with\nthe maintenance of a normal standard of health. How about it?\" He turned\nto the Doctor. \"You ought to have an opinion on that.\"\n\n\"I rather think you are right,\" said the latter thoughtfully, \"although\nI doubt very much if the man who took it easy would do as much during\nhis longer life as the other with his energy would accomplish in the\nlesser time allotted to him.\"\n\n\"Probably he wouldn't,\" smiled the Chemist; \"but that does not alter the\npoint we are discussing.\"\n\n\"How does this apply to the world in the ring?\" ventured the Very Young\nMan.\n\n\"I believe there is a very close relationship between the dimensions of\nlength, breadth, and thickness, and time. Just what connection with them\nit has, I have no idea. Yet, when size changes, time-rate changes; you\nhave only to look at our own universe to discover that.\"\n\n\"How do you mean?\" asked the Very Young Man.\n\n\"Why, all life on our earth, in a general way, illustrates the\nfundamental fact that the larger a thing is, the slower its\ntime-progress is. An elephant, for example, lives more years than we\nhumans. Yet how quickly a fly is born, matured, and aged! There are\nexceptions, of course; but in a majority of cases it is true.\n\n\"So I believe that as I diminished in stature, my time-progress became\nfaster and faster. I am seven days older than when I left you day before\nyesterday. I have lived those seven days, gentlemen, there is no getting\naround that fact.\"\n\n\"This is all tremendously interesting,\" sighed the Big Business Man;\n\"but not very comprehensible.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nSTRATEGY AND KISSES\n\n\n\"It was the morning of my third day in the castle,\" began the Chemist\nagain, \"that I was taken by Lylda before the king. We found him seated\nalone in a little anteroom, overlooking a large courtyard, which we\ncould see was crowded with an expectant, waiting throng. I must explain\nto you now, that I was considered by Lylda somewhat in the light of a\nMessiah, come to save her nation from the destruction that threatened\nit.\n\n\"She believed me a supernatural being, which, indeed, if you come to\nthink of it, gentlemen, is exactly what I was. I tried to tell her\nsomething of myself and the world I had come from, but the difficulties\nof language and her smiling insistence and faith in her own conception\nof me, soon caused me to desist. Thereafter I let her have her own way,\nand did not attempt any explanation again for some time.\n\n\"For several weeks before Lylda found me sleeping by the river's edge,\nshe had made almost a daily pilgrimage to that vicinity. A maidenly\npremonition, a feeling that had first come to her several years before,\ntold her of my coming, and her father's knowledge and scientific beliefs\nhad led her to the outer surface of the world as the direction in which\nto look. A curious circumstance, gentlemen, lies in the fact that Lylda\nclearly remembered the occasion when this first premonition came to her.\nAnd in the telling, she described graphically the scene in the cave,\nwhere I saw her through the microscope.\" The Chemist paused an instant\nand then resumed.\n\n\"When we entered the presence of the king, he greeted me quietly, and\nmade me sit by his side, while Lylda knelt on the floor at our feet. The\nking impressed me as a man about fifty years of age. He was\nsmooth-shaven, with black, wavy hair, reaching his shoulders. He was\ndressed in the usual tunic, the upper part of his body covered by a\nquite similar garment, ornamented with a variety of metal objects. His\nfeet were protected with a sort of buskin; at his side hung a\ncrude-looking metal spear.\n\n\"The conversation that followed my entrance, lasted perhaps fifteen\nminutes. Lylda interpreted for us as well as she could, though I must\nconfess we were all three at times completely at a loss. But Lylda's\nbright, intelligent little face, and the resourcefulness of her\ngestures, always managed somehow to convey her meaning. The charm and\ngrace of her manner, all during the talk, her winsomeness, and the\nalmost spiritual kindness and tenderness that characterized her, made me\nfeel that she embodied all those qualities with which we of this earth\nidealize our own womanhood.\n\n\"I found myself falling steadily under the spell of her beauty,\nuntil--well, gentlemen, it's childish for me to enlarge upon this side\nof my adventure, you know; but--Lylda means everything to me now, and\nI'm going back for her just as soon as I possibly can.\"\n\n\"Bully for you!\" cried the Very Young Man. \"Why didn't you bring her\nwith you this time?\"\n\n\"Let him tell it his own way,\" remonstrated the Doctor. The Very Young\nMan subsided with a sigh.\n\n\"During our talk,\" resumed the Chemist, \"I learned from the king that\nLylda had promised him my assistance in overcoming the enemies that\nthreatened his country. He smilingly told me that our charming little\ninterpreter had assured him I would be able to do this. Lylda's blushing\nface, as she conveyed this meaning to me, was so thoroughly captivating,\nthat before I knew it, and quite without meaning to, I pulled her up\ntowards me and kissed her.\n\n\"The king was more surprised by far than Lylda, at this extraordinary\nbehavior. Obviously neither of them had understood what a kiss meant,\nalthough Lylda, by her manner evidently comprehended pretty thoroughly.\n\n\"I told them then, as simply as possible to enable Lylda to get my\nmeaning, that I could, and would gladly aid in their war. I explained\nthen, that I had the power to change my stature, and could make myself\ngrow very large or very small in a short space of time.\n\n\"This, as Lylda evidently told it to him, seemed quite beyond the king's\nunderstanding. He comprehended finally, or at least he agreed to believe\nmy statement.\n\n\"This led to the consideration of practical questions of how I was to\nproceed in their war. I had not considered any details before, but now\nthey appeared of the utmost simplicity. All I had to do was to make\nmyself a hundred or two hundred feet high, walk out to the battle-lines,\nand scatter the opposing army like a set of small boys' playthings.\"\n\n\"What a quaint idea!\" said the Banker. \"A modern 'Gulliver.'\"\n\nThe Chemist did not heed this interruption.\n\n\"Then like three children we plunged into a discussion of exactly how I\nwas to perform these wonders, the king laughing heartily as we pictured\nthe attack on my tiny enemies.\n\n\"He then asked me how I expected to accomplish this change of size, and\nI very briefly told him of our larger world, and the manner in which I\nhad come from it into his. Then I showed the drugs that I still carried\ncarefully strapped to me. This seemed definitely to convince the king of\nmy sincerity. He rose abruptly to his feet, and strode through a doorway\non to a small balcony overlooking the courtyard below.\n\n\"As he stepped out into the view of the people, a great cheer arose. He\nwaited quietly for them to stop, and then raised his hand and began\nspeaking. Lylda and I stood hand in hand in the shadow of the doorway,\nout of sight of the crowd, but with it and the entire courtyard plainly\nin our view.\n\n\"It was a quadrangular enclosure, formed by the four sides of the\npalace, perhaps three hundred feet across, packed solidly now with\npeople of both sexes, the gleaming whiteness of the upper parts of their\nbodies, and their upturned faces, making a striking picture.\n\n\"For perhaps ten minutes the king spoke steadily, save when he was\ninterrupted by applause. Then he stopped abruptly and, turning, pulled\nLylda and me out upon the balcony. The enthusiasm of the crowd doubled\nat our appearance. I was pushed forward to the balcony rail, where I\nbowed to the cheering throng.\n\n\"Just after I left the king's balcony, I met Lylda's father. He was a\nkindly-faced old gentleman, and took a great interest in me and my\nstory. He it was who told me about the physical conformation of his\nworld, and he seemed to comprehend my explanation of mine.\n\n\"That night it rained--a heavy, torrential downpour, such as we have in\nthe tropics. Lylda and I had been talking for some time, and, I must\nconfess, I had been making love to her ardently. I broached now the\nprincipal object of my entrance into her world, and, with an eloquence I\ndid not believe I possessed, I pictured the wonders of our own great\nearth above, begging her to come back with me and live out her life with\nmine.\n\n\"Much of what I said, she probably did not understand, but the main\nfacts were intelligible without question. She listened quietly. When I\nhad finished, and waited for her decision, she reached slowly out and\nclutched my shoulders, awkwardly making as if to kiss me. In an instant\nshe was in my arms, with a low, happy little cry.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nA MODERN GULLIVER\n\n\n\"The clattering fall of rain brought us to ourselves. Rising to her\nfeet, Lylda pulled me over to the window-opening, and together we stood\nand looked out into the night. The scene before us was beautiful, with a\nweirdness almost impossible to describe. It was as bright as I had ever\nseen this world, for even though heavy clouds hung overhead, the light\nfrom the stars was never more than a negligible quantity.\n\n\"We were facing the lake--a shining expanse of silver radiation, its\nsurface shifting and crawling, as though a great undulating blanket of\nsilver mist lay upon it. And coming down to meet it from the sky were\ninnumerable lines of silver--a vast curtain of silver cords that broke\napart into great strings of pearls when I followed their downward\ncourse.\n\n\"And then, as I turned to Lylda, I was struck with the extraordinary\nweirdness of her beauty as never before. The reflected light from the\nrain had something the quality of our moonlight. Shining on Lylda's\nbody, it tremendously enhanced the iridescence of her skin. And her\nface, upturned to mine, bore an expression of radiant happiness and\npeace such as I had never seen before on a woman's countenance.\"\n\nThe Chemist paused, his voice dying away into silence as he sat lost in\nthought. Then he pulled himself together with a start. \"It was a sight,\ngentlemen, the memory of which I shall cherish all my life.\n\n\"The next day was that set for my entrance into the war. Lylda and I had\ntalked nearly all night, and had decided that she was to return with me\nto my world. By morning the rain had stopped, and we sat together in the\nwindow-opening, silenced with the thrill of the wonderful new joy that\nhad come into our hearts.\n\n\"The country before us, under the cloudless, starry sky, stretched\ngray-blue and beautiful into the quivering obscurity of the distance. At\nour feet lay the city, just awakening into life. Beyond, over the\nrolling meadows and fields, wound the road that led out to the\nbattle-front, and coming back over it now, we could see an endless line\nof vehicles. These, as they passed through the street beneath our\nwindow, I found were loaded with soldiers, wounded and dying. I\nshuddered at the sight of one cart in particular, and Lylda pressed\nclose to me, pleading with her eyes for my help for her stricken people.\n\n\"My exit from the castle was made quite a ceremony. A band of music and\na guard of several hundred soldiers ushered me forth, walking beside the\nking, with Lylda a few paces behind. As we passed through the streets of\nthe city, heading for the open country beyond, we were cheered\ncontinually by the people who thronged the streets and crowded upon the\nhousetops to watch us pass.\n\n\"Outside Arite I was taken perhaps a mile, where a wide stretch of\ncountry gave me the necessary space for my growth. We were standing upon\na slight hill, below which, in a vast semicircle, fully a hundred\nthousand people were watching.\n\n\"And now, for the first time, fear overcame me. I realized my\nsituation--saw myself in a detached sort of way--a stranger in this\nextraordinary world, and only the power of my drug to raise me out of\nit. This drug you must remember, I had not as yet taken. Suppose it were\nnot to act? Or were to act wrongly?\n\n\"I glanced around. The king stood before me, quietly waiting my\npleasure. Then I turned to Lylda. One glance at her proud, happy little\nface, and my fear left me as suddenly as it had come. I took her in my\narms and kissed her, there before that multitude. Then I set her down,\nand signified to the king I was ready.\n\n\"I took a minute quantity of one of the drugs, and as I had done before,\nsat down with my eyes covered. My sensations were fairly similar to\nthose I have already described. When I looked up after a moment, I found\nthe landscape dwindling to tiny proportions in quite as astonishing a\nway as it had grown before. The king and Lylda stood now hardly above my\nankle.\n\n\"A great cry arose from the people--a cry wherein horror, fear, and\napplause seemed equally mixed. I looked down and saw thousands of them\nrunning away in terror.\n\n\"Still smaller grew everything within my vision, and then, after a\nmoment, the landscape seemed at rest. I kneeled now upon the ground,\ncarefully, to avoid treading on any of the people around me. I located\nLylda and the king after a moment; tiny little creatures less than an\ninch in height. I was then, I estimated, from their viewpoint, about\nfour hundred feet tall.\n\n\"I put my hand flat upon the ground near Lylda, and after a moment she\nclimbed into it, two soldiers lifting her up the side of my thumb as it\nlay upon the ground. In the hollow of my palm, she lay quite securely,\nand very carefully I raised her up towards my face. Then, seeing that\nshe was frightened, I set her down again.\n\n\"At my feet, hardly more than a few steps away, lay the tiny city of\nArite and the lake. I could see all around the latter now, and could\nmake out clearly a line of hills on the other side. Off to the left the\nroad wound up out of sight in the distance. As far as I could see, a\nline of soldiers was passing out along this road--marching four abreast,\nwith carts at intervals, loaded evidently with supplies; only\noccasionally, now, vehicles passed in the other direction. Can I make it\nplain to you, gentlemen, my sensations in changing stature? I felt at\nfirst as though I were tremendously high in the air, looking down as\nfrom a balloon upon the familiar territory beneath me. That feeling\npassed after a few moments, and I found that my point of view had\nchanged. I no longer felt that I was looking down from a balloon, but\nfelt as a normal person feels. And again I conceived myself but six feet\ntall, standing above a dainty little toy world. It is all in the\nviewpoint, of course, and never, during all my changes, was I for more\nthan a moment able to feel of a different stature than I am at this\npresent instant. It was always everything else that changed.\n\n\"According to the directions I had received from the king, I started now\nto follow the course of the road. I found it difficult walking, for the\ncountry was dotted with houses, trees, and cultivated fields, and each\nfootstep was a separate problem.\n\n\"I progressed in this manner perhaps two miles, covering what the day\nbefore I would have called about a hundred and thirty or forty miles.\nThe country became wilder as I advanced, and now was in places crowded\nwith separate collections of troops.\n\n\"I have not mentioned the commotion I made in this walk over the\ncountry. My coming must have been told widely by couriers the night\nbefore, to soldiers and peasantry alike, or the sight of me would have\ncaused utter demoralization. As it was, I must have been terrifying to a\ntremendous degree. I think the careful way in which I picked my course,\nstepping in the open as much as possible, helped to reassure the people.\nBehind me, whenever I turned, they seemed rather more curious than\nfearful, and once or twice when I stopped for a few moments they\napproached my feet closely. One athletic young soldier caught the loose\nend of the string of one of my buskins, as it hung over my instep close\nto the ground and pulled himself up hand over hand, amid the\nenthusiastic cheers of his comrades.\n\n\"I had walked nearly another mile, when almost in front of me, and\nperhaps a hundred yards away, I saw a remarkable sight that I did not at\nfirst understand. The country here was crossed by a winding river\nrunning in a general way at right angles to my line of progress. At the\nright, near at hand, and on the nearer bank of the river, lay a little\ncity, perhaps half the size of Arite, with its back up against a hill.\n\n\"What first attracted my attention was that from a dark patch across the\nriver which seemed to be woods, pebbles appeared to pop up at intervals,\ntraversing a little arc perhaps as high as my knees, and falling into\nthe city. I watched for a moment and then I understood. There was a\nsiege in progress, and the catapults of the Malites were bombarding the\ncity with rocks.\n\n\"I went up a few steps closer, and the pebbles stopped coming. I stood\nnow beside the city, and as I bent over it, I could see by the battered\nhouses the havoc the bombardment had caused. Inert little figures lay in\nthe streets, and I bent lower and inserted my thumb and forefinger\nbetween a row of houses and picked one up. It was the body of a woman,\npartly mashed. I set it down again hastily.\n\n\"Then as I stood up, I felt a sting on my leg. A pebble had hit me on\nthe shin and dropped at my feet. I picked it up. It was the size of a\nsmall walnut--a huge bowlder six feet or more in diameter it would have\nbeen in Lylda's eyes. At the thought of her I was struck with a sudden\nfit of anger. I flung the pebble violently down into the wooded patch\nand leaped over the river in one bound, landing squarely on both feet in\nthe woods. It was like jumping into a patch of ferns.\n\n\"I stamped about me for a moment until a large part of the woods was\ncrushed down. Then I bent over and poked around with my finger.\nUnderneath the tangled wreckage of tiny-tree trunks, lay numbers of the\nMalites. I must have trodden upon a thousand or more, as one would stamp\nupon insects.\n\n\"The sight sickened me at first, for after all, I could not look upon\nthem as other than men, even though they were only the length of my\nthumb-nail. I walked a few steps forward, and in all directions I could\nsee swarms of the little creatures running. Then the memory of my coming\ndeparture from this world with Lylda, and my promise to the king to rid\nhis land once for all from these people, made me feel again that they,\nlike vermin, were to be destroyed.\n\n\"Without looking directly down, I spent the next two hours stamping over\nthis entire vicinity. Then I ran two or three miles directly toward the\ncountry of the Malites, and returning I stamped along the course of the\nriver for a mile or so in both directions. Then I walked back to Arite,\nagain picking my way carefully among crowds of Oroids, who now feared me\nso little that I had difficulty in moving without stepping upon them.\n\n\"When I had regained my former size, which needed two successive doses\nof the drug, I found myself surrounded by a crowd of the Oroids, pushing\nand shoving each other in an effort to get closer to me. The news of my\nsuccess over their enemy have been divined by them, evidently. Lord\nknows it must have been obvious enough what I was going to do, when they\nsaw me stride away, a being four hundred feet tall.\n\n\"Their enthusiasm and thankfulness now were so mixed with awe and\nreverent worship of me as a divine being, that when I advanced towards\nArite they opened a path immediately. The king, accompanied by Lylda,\nmet me at the edge of the city. The latter threw herself into my arms at\nonce, crying with relief to find me the proper size once more.\n\n\"I need not go into details of the ceremonies of rejoicing that took\nplace this afternoon. These people seemed little given to pomp and\npublic demonstration. The king made a speech from his balcony, telling\nthem all I had done, and the city was given over to festivities and\npreparations to receive the returning soldiers.\"\n\nThe Chemist pushed his chair back from the table, and moistened his dry\nlips with a swallow of water. \"I tell you, gentlemen,\" he continued, \"I\nfelt pretty happy that day. It's a wonderful feeling to find yourself\nthe savior of a nation.\"\n\nAt that the Doctor jumped to his feet, overturning his chair, and\nstriking the table a blow with his fist that made the glasses dance.\n\n\"By God!\" he fairly shouted, \"that's just what you can be here to us.\"\n\nThe Banker looked startled, while the Very Young Man pulled the Chemist\nby the coat in his eagerness to be heard. \"A few of those pills,\" he\nsaid in a voice that quivered with excitement, \"when you are standing in\nFrance, and you can walk over to Berlin and kick the houses apart with\nthe toe of your boot.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" said the Big Business Man, and silence fell on the group as\nthey stared at each other, awed by the possibilities that opened up\nbefore them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\"I MUST GO BACK\"\n\n\nThe tremendous plan for the salvation of their own suffering world\nthrough the Chemist's discovery occupied the five friends for some time.\nThen laying aside this subject, that now had become of the most vital\nimportance to them all, the Chemist resumed his narrative.\n\n\"My last evening in the world of the ring, I spent with Lylda,\ndiscussing our future, and making plans for the journey. I must tell you\nnow, gentlemen, that never for a moment during my stay in Arite was I\nonce free from an awful dread of this return trip. I tried to conceive\nwhat it would be like, and the more I thought about it, the more\nhazardous it seemed.\n\n\"You must realize, when I was growing smaller, coming in, I was able to\nclimb down, or fall or slide down, into the spaces as they opened up.\nGoing back, I could only imagine the world as closing in upon me,\ncrushing me to death unless I could find a larger space immediately\nabove into which I could climb.\n\n\"And as I talked with Lylda about this and tried to make her understand\nwhat I hardly understood myself, I gradually was brought to realize the\nfull gravity of the danger confronting us. If only I had made the trip\nout once before, I could have ventured it with her. But as I looked at\nher fragile little body, to expose it to the terrible possibilities of\nsuch a journey was unthinkable.\n\n\"There was another question, too, that troubled me. I had been gone from\nyou nearly a week, and you were only to wait for me two days. I believed\nfirmly that I was living at a faster rate, and that probably my time\nwith you had not expired. But I did not know. And suppose, when I had\ncome out on to the surface of the ring, one of you had had it on his\nfinger walking along the street? No, I did not want Lylda with me in\nthat event.\n\n\"And so I told her--made her understand--that she must stay behind, and\nthat I would come back for her. She did not protest. She said\nnothing--just looked up into my face with wide, staring eyes and a\nlittle quiver of her lips. Then she clutched my hand and fell into a\nlow, sobbing cry.\n\n\"I held her in my arms for a few moments, so little, so delicate, so\nhuman in her sorrow, and yet almost superhuman in her radiant beauty.\nSoon she stopped crying and smiled up at me bravely.\n\n\"Next morning I left. Lylda took me through the tunnels and back into\nthe forest by the river's edge where I had first met her. There we\nparted. I can see, now, her pathetic, drooping little figure as she\ntrudged back to the tunnel.\n\n\"When she had disappeared, I sat down to plan out my journey. I resolved\nnow to reverse as nearly as possible the steps I had taken coming in.\nActing on this decision, I started back to that portion of the forest\nwhere I had trampled it down.\n\n\"I found the place without difficulty, stopping once on the way to eat a\nfew berries, and some of the food I carried with me. Then I took a small\namount of one of the drugs, and in a few moments the forest trees had\ndwindled into tiny twigs beneath my feet.\n\n\"I started now to find the huge incline down which I had fallen, and\nwhen I reached it, after some hours of wandering, I followed its bottom\nedge to where a pile of rocks and dirt marked my former landing-place.\nThe rocks were much larger than I remembered them, and so I knew I was\nnot so large, now, as when I was here before.\n\n\"Remembering the amount of the drug I had taken coming down, I took now\ntwelve of the pills. Then, in a sudden panic, I hastily took two of the\nothers. The result made my head swim most horribly. I sat or lay down, I\nforget which. When I looked up I saw the hills beyond the river and\nforest coming towards me, yet dwindling away beneath my feet as they\napproached. The incline seemed folding up upon itself, like a telescope.\nAs I watched, its upper edge came into view, a curved, luminous line\nagainst the blackness above. Every instant it crawled down closer, more\nsharply curved, and its inclined surface grew steeper.\n\n\"All this time, as I stood still, the ground beneath my feet seemed to\nbe moving. It was crawling towards me, and folding up underneath where I\nwas standing. Frequently I had to move to avoid rocks that came at me\nand passed under my feet into nothingness.\n\n\"Then, all at once, I realized that I had been stepping constantly\nbackward, to avoid the inclined wall as it shoved itself towards me. I\nturned to see what was behind, and horror made my flesh creep at what I\nsaw. A black, forbidding wall, much like the incline in front, entirely\nencircled me. It was hardly more than half a mile away, and towered four\nor five thousand feet overhead.\n\n\"And as I stared in terror, I could see it closing in, the line of its\nupper edge coming steadily closer and lower. I looked wildly around with\nan overpowering impulse to run. In every direction towered this rocky\nwall, inexorably swaying in to crush me.\n\n\"I think I fainted. When I came to myself the scene had not greatly\nchanged. I was lying at the bottom and against one wall of a circular\npit, now about a thousand feet in diameter and nearly twice as deep. The\nwall all around I could see was almost perpendicular, and it seemed\nimpossible to ascend its smooth, shining sides. The action of the drug\nhad evidently worn off, for everything was quite still.\n\n\"My fear had now left me, for I remembered this circular pit quite well.\nI walked over to its center, and looking around and up to its top I\nestimated distances carefully. Then I took two more of the pills.\n\n\"Immediately the familiar, sickening, crawling sensation began again. As\nthe walls closed in upon me, I kept carefully in the center of the pit.\nSteadily they crept in. Now only a few hundred feet away! Now only a few\npaces--and then I reached out and touched both sides at once with my\nhands.\n\n\"I tell you, gentlemen, it was a terrifying sensation to stand in that\nwell (as it now seemed), and feel its walls closing up with irresistible\nforce. But now the upper edge was within reach of my fingers. I leaped\nupward and hung for a moment, then pulled myself up and scrabbled out,\ntumbling in a heap on the ground above. As I recovered myself, I looked\nagain at the hole out of which I had escaped; it was hardly big enough\nto contain my fist.\n\n\"I knew, now, I was at the bottom of the scratch. But how different it\nlooked than before. It seemed this time a long, narrow ca\u00f1on, hardly\nmore than sixty feet across. I glanced up and saw the blue sky overhead,\nflooded with light, that I knew was the space of this room above the\nring.\n\n\"The problem now was quite a different one than getting out of the pit,\nfor I saw that the scratch was so deep in proportion to its width that\nif I let myself get too big, I would be crushed by its walls before I\ncould jump out. It would be necessary, therefore, to stay comparatively\nsmall and climb up its side.\n\n\"I selected what appeared to be an especially rough section, and took a\nportion of another of the pills. Then I started to climb. After an hour\nthe buskins on my feet were torn to fragments, and I was bruised and\nbattered as you saw me. I see, now, how I could have made both the\ndescent into the ring, and my journey back with comparatively little\neffort, but I did the best I knew at the time.\n\n\"When the ca\u00f1on was about ten feet in width, and I had been climbing\narduously for several hours, I found myself hardly more than fifteen or\ntwenty feet above its bottom. And I was still almost that far from the\ntop. With the stature I had then attained, I could have climbed the\nremaining distance easily, but for the fact that the wall above had\ngrown too smooth to afford a foothold. The effects of the drug had again\nworn off, and I sat down and prepared to take another dose. I did\nso--the smallest amount I could--and held ready in my hand a pill of the\nother kind in case of emergency. Steadily the walls closed in.\n\n\"A terrible feeling of dizziness now came over me. I clutched the rock\nbeside which I was sitting, and it seemed to melt like ice beneath my\ngrasp. Then I remembered seeing the edge of the ca\u00f1on within reach above\nmy head, and with my last remaining strength, I pulled myself up, and\nfell upon the surface of the ring. You know the rest. I took another\ndose of the powder, and in a few minutes was back among you.\"\n\nThe Chemist stopped speaking, and looked at his friends. \"Well,\" he\nsaid, \"you've heard it all. What do you think of it?\"\n\n\"It is a terrible thing to me,\" sighed the Very Young Man, \"that you did\nnot bring Llyda with you.\"\n\n\"It would have been a terrible thing if I had brought her. But I am\ngoing back for her.\"\n\n\"When do you plan to go back?\" asked the Doctor after a moment.\n\n\"As soon as I can--in a day or two,\" answered the Chemist.\n\n\"Before you do your work here? You must not,\" remonstrated the Big\nBusiness Man. \"Our war here needs you, our nation, the whole cause of\nliberty and freedom needs you. You cannot go.\"\n\n\"Lylda needs me, too,\" returned the Chemist. \"I have an obligation\ntowards her now, you know, quite apart from my own feelings. Understand\nme, gentlemen,\" he continued earnestly, \"I do not place myself and mine\nbefore the great fight for democracy and justice being waged in this\nworld. That would be absurd. But it is not quite that way, actually; I\ncan go back for Lylda and return here in a week. That week will make\nlittle difference to the war. On the other hand, if I go to France\nfirst, it may take me a good many months to complete my task, and during\nthat time Lylda will be using up her life several times faster than I.\nNo, gentlemen, I am going to her first.\"\n\n\"That week you propose to take,\" said the Banker slowly, \"will cost this\nworld thousands of lives that you could save. Have you thought of that?\"\n\nThe Chemist flushed. \"I can recognize the salvation of a nation or a\ncause,\" he returned hotly, \"but if I must choose between the lives of a\nthousand men who are not dependent on me, and the life or welfare of one\nwoman who is, I shall choose the woman.\"\n\n\"He's right, you know,\" said the Doctor, and the Very Young Man agreed\nwith him fervently.\n\nTwo days later the company met again in the privacy of the clubroom.\nWhen they had finished dinner, the Chemist began in his usual quiet way:\n\n\"I am going to ask you this time, gentlemen, to give me a full week.\nThere are four of you--six hours a day of watching for each. It need not\nbe too great a hardship. You see,\" he continued, as they nodded in\nagreement, \"I want to spend a longer period in the ring world this time.\nI may never go back, and I want to learn, in the interest of science, as\nmuch about it as I can. I was there such a short time before, and it was\nall so strange and remarkable, I confess I learned practically nothing.\n\n\"I told you all I could of its history. But of its arts, its science,\nand all its sociological and economic questions, I got hardly more than\na glimpse. It is a world and a people far less advanced than ours, yet\nwith something we have not, and probably never will have--the\nuniversally distributed milk of human kindness. Yes, gentlemen, it is a\nworld well worth studying.\"\n\nThe Banker came out of a brown study. \"How about your formulas for these\ndrugs?\" he asked abruptly; \"where are they?\" The Chemist tapped his\nforehead smilingly. \"Well, hadn't you better leave them with us?\" the\nBanker pursued. \"The hazards of your trip--you can't tell----\"\n\n\"Don't misunderstand me, gentlemen,\" broke in the Chemist. \"I wouldn't\ngive you those formulas if my life and even Lylda's depended on it.\nThere again you do not differentiate between the individual and the\nrace. I know you four very well. You are my friends, with all the bond\nthat friendship implies. I believe in your integrity--each of you I\ntrust implicitly. With these formulas you could crush Germany, or you\ncould, any one of you, rule the world, with all its treasures for your\nown. These drugs are the most powerful thing for good in the world\nto-day. But they are equally as powerful for evil. I would stake my life\non what you would do, but I will not stake the life of a nation.\"\n\n\"I know what I'd do if I had the formulas,\" began the Very Young Man.\n\n\"Yes, but I don't know what you'd do,\" laughed the Chemist. \"Don't you\nsee I'm right?\" They admitted they did, though the Banker acquiesced\nvery grudgingly.\n\n\"The time of my departure is at hand. Is there anything else, gentlemen,\nbefore I leave you?\" asked the Chemist, beginning to disrobe.\n\n\"Please tell Lylda I want very much to meet her,\" said the Very Young\nMan earnestly, and they all laughed.\n\nWhen the room was cleared, and the handkerchief and ring in place once\nmore, the Chemist turned to them again. \"Good-by, my friends,\" he said,\nholding out his hands. \"One week from to-night, at most.\" Then he took\nthe pills.\n\nNo unusual incident marked his departure. The last they saw of him he\nwas calmly sitting on the ring near the scratch.\n\nThen passed the slow days of watching, each taking his turn for the\nallotted six hours.\n\nBy the fifth day, they began to hourly expect the Chemist, but it passed\nthrough its weary length, and he did not come. The sixth day dragged by,\nand then came the last--the day he had promised would end their\nwatching. Still he did not come, and in the evening they gathered, and\nall four watched together, each unwilling to miss the return of the\nadventurer and his woman from another world.\n\nBut the minutes lengthened into hours, and midnight found the\nwhite-faced little group, hopeful yet hopeless, with fear tugging at\ntheir hearts. A second week passed, and still they watched, explaining\nwith an optimism they could none of them feel, the non-appearance of\ntheir friend. At the end of the second week they met again to talk the\nsituation over, a dull feeling of fear and horror possessing them. The\nDoctor was the first to voice what now each of them was forced to\nbelieve. \"I guess it's all useless,\" he said. \"He's not coming back.\"\n\n\"I don't hardly dare give him up,\" said the Big Business Man.\n\n\"Me, too,\" agreed the Very Young Man sadly.\n\nThe Doctor sat for some time in silence, thoughtfully regarding the\nring. \"My friends,\" he began finally, \"this is too big a thing to deal\nwith in any but the most careful way. I can't imagine what is going on\ninside that ring, but I do know what is happening in our world, and what\nour friend's return means to civilization here. Under the circumstances,\ntherefore, I cannot, I will not give him up.\n\n\"I am going to put that ring in a museum and pay for having it watched\nindefinitely. Will you join me?\" He turned to the Big Business Man as he\nspoke.\n\n\"Make it a threesome,\" said the Banker gruffly. \"What do you take me\nfor?\" and the Very Young Man sighed with the tragedy of youth.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nAFTER FIVE YEARS\n\n\nFour men sat in the clubroom, at their ease in the luxurious leather\nchairs, smoking and talking earnestly. Near the center of the room stood\na huge mahogany table. On its top, directly in the glare of light from\nan electrolier overhead, was spread a large black silk handkerchief. In\nthe center of this handkerchief lay a heavy gold band--a woman's\nwedding-ring.\n\nAn old-fashioned valise stood near a corner of the table. Its sides were\nperforated with small brass-rimmed holes; near the top on one side was a\nsmall square aperture covered with a wire mesh through which one might\nlook into the interior. Altogether, from the outside, the bag looked\nmuch like those used for carrying small animals.\n\nAs it lay on the table now its top was partly open. The inside was\nbrightly lighted by a small storage battery and electric globe, fastened\nto the side. Near the bottom of the bag was a tiny wire rack, held\nsuspended about an inch from the bottom by transverse wires to the\nsides. The inside of the bag was lined with black plush.\n\nOn an arm of the Doctor's chair lay two white tin boxes three or four\ninches square. In his hand he held an opened envelope and several letter\npages.\n\n\"A little more than five years ago to-night, my friends,\" he began\nslowly, \"we sat in this room with that\"--he indicated the ring--\"under\nvery different circumstances.\" After a moment, he went on:\n\n\"I think I am right when I say that for five years the thought uppermost\nin our minds has always been that ring and what is going on within one\nof its atoms.\"\n\n\"You bet,\" said the Very Young Man.\n\n\"For five years now we have had the ring watched,\" continued the Doctor,\n\"but Rogers has never returned.\"\n\n\"You asked us here to-night because you had something special to tell\nus,\" began the Very Young Man, with a questioning look at the valise and\nthe ring.\n\nThe Doctor smiled. \"I'm sorry,\" he said, \"I don't mean to be\naggravating.\"\n\n\"Go ahead in your own way, Frank,\" the Big Business Man put in. \"We'll\nwait if we have to.\"\n\nThe Doctor glanced at the papers in his hand; he had just taken them\nfrom the envelope. \"You are consumed with curiosity, naturally, to know\nwhat I have to say--why I have brought the ring here to-night.\nGentlemen, you have had to restrain that curiosity less than five\nminutes; I have had a far greater curiosity to endure--and restrain--for\nover five years.\n\n\"When Rogers left us on his last journey into the ring, he gave into my\nkeeping, unknown to you, this envelope.\" The Doctor held it up.\n\n\"He made me swear I would keep its existence secret from every living\nbeing, until the date marked upon it, at which time, in the event of his\nnot having returned, it was to be opened. Look at it.\" The Doctor laid\nthe envelope on the table.\n\n\"It is inscribed, as you see, 'To be opened by Dr. Frank Adams at\n8 P. M. on September 4th, 1923.' For five years, gentlemen, I kept that\nenvelope, knowing nothing of its contents and waiting for the moment\nwhen I might, with honor, open it. The struggle has been a hard one.\nMany times I have almost been able to persuade myself, in justice to our\nfriend's safety--his very life, probably--that it would be best to\ndisregard his instructions. But I did not; I waited until the date set\nand then, a little more than a month ago, alone in my office, I opened\nthe envelope.\"\n\nThe Doctor leaned forward in his chair and shuffled the papers he held\nin his hand. His three friends sat tense, waiting.\n\n\"The envelope contained these papers. Among them is a letter in which I\nam directed to explain everything to you as soon as I succeed in doing\ncertain other things. Those things I have now accomplished. So I have\nsent for you. I'll read you the letter first.\"\n\nNo one spoke when the Doctor paused. The Banker drew a long breath. Then\nhe bit the end off a fresh cigar and lit it with a shaking hand. The\nDoctor shifted his chair closer to the table under the light.\n\n\"The letter is dated September 14th, 1918. It begins: 'This will be read\nat 8 P. M. on September 4th, 1923, by Dr. Frank Adams with no one else\npresent. If the envelope has been opened by him previous to that date I\nrequest him to read no further. If it has fallen into other hands than\nhis I can only hope that the reader will immediately destroy it\nunread.'\" The Doctor paused an instant, then went on.\n\n\"Gentlemen, we are approaching the most important events of our lives.\nAn extraordinary duty--a tremendous responsibility, rests with us, of\nall the millions of people on this earth. I ask that you listen most\ncarefully.\"\n\nHis admonition was quite unnecessary, for no one could have been more\nintent than the three men silently facing him.\n\nThe Doctor continued reading: \"'From Dr. Frank Adams, I exact the\nfollowing oath, before he reads further. You, Dr. Adams, will divulge to\nno one, for a period of thirty days, the formulas set down in these\npapers; you will follow implicitly the directions given you; you will do\nnothing that is not expressly stated here. Should you be unable to carry\nout these directions, you will destroy this letter and the formulas, and\ntell no one of their ever having been in existence. I must have your\noath, Dr. Adams, before you proceed further.'\"\n\nThe Doctor's voice died away, and he laid the papers on the table.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" he went on, \"later on in the letter I am directed to\nconsult with you three, setting before you this whole matter. But before\nI do so I must exact a similar oath from each of you. I must have your\nword of honor, gentlemen, that you will not attempt to transgress the\ninstructions given us, and that you will never, by word or action, allow\na suggestion of what passes between us here in this room to-night, to\nreach any other person. Have I your promise?\"\n\nEach of his three hearers found voice to agree. The Banker's face was\nvery red, and he mopped his forehead nervously with his handkerchief.\n\nThe Doctor picked up the papers. \"The letter goes on: 'I am about to\nventure back into the unknown world of the ring. What will befall me\nthere I cannot foretell. If by September 4th, 1923, I have not returned,\nor no other mortal has come out of the ring, it is my desire that you\nand the three gentlemen with you at the time of my departure, use this\ndiscovery of mine for the benefit of humanity in your world, or the\nworld in the ring, exactly as I myself would have used it were I there.\n\n\"'Should the European war be in progress at that time, I direct that you\nfour throw your power on the side of the United States for the defeat of\nthe Central Powers. That you will be able to accomplish that defeat I\ncannot doubt.\n\n\"'If, on September 4th, 1923, the United States is formally at peace\nwith the powers of the world, you are forbidden to use these chemicals\nfor any purpose other than joining me in the world of the ring. If any\namong you wish to make the venture, which I hope may be the case, I\nrequest that you do so.\n\n\"'Among these pages you will find a list of fourteen chemicals to be\nused by Dr. Frank Adams during the month following September 4, 1923,\nfor the compounding of my powders. Seven of these chemicals (marked A),\nare employed in the drug used to diminish bodily size. Those seven\nmarked B are for the drug of opposite action.\n\n\"'You will find here a separate description of each chemical. Nine are\nwell known and fairly common. Dr. Adams will be able to purchase each of\nthem separately without difficulty. Three others will have to be\nespecially compounded and I have so stated in the directions for each of\nthem. Dr. Adams can have them prepared by any large chemical\nmanufacturer; I suggest that he have not more than one of them\ncompounded by the same company.\n\n\"'The two remaining chemicals must be prepared by Dr. Adams personally.\nTheir preparation, while intricate, demands no complicated or extensive\napparatus. I have tried to explain thoroughly the making of these two\nchemicals, and I believe no insurmountable obstacle will be met in\ncompleting them.\n\n\"'When Dr. Adams has the specified quantities of each of these fourteen\nchemicals in his possession, he will proceed according to my further\ndirections to compound the two drugs. If he is successful in making\nthese drugs, I direct that he make known to the three other men referred\nto, the contents of this letter, after first exacting an oath from each\nthat its provisions will be carried out.\n\n\"'I think it probable that Dr. Adams will succeed in compounding these\ntwo drugs. It also seems probable that at that time the United States no\nlonger will be at war. I make the additional assumption that one or more\nof you gentlemen will desire to join me in the ring. Therefore, you will\nfind herewith memoranda of my first journey into the ring which I have\nalready described to you; I give also the quantities of each drug to be\ntaken at various stages of the trip. These notes will refresh your\nmemory and will assist you in your journey.\n\n\"'I intend to suggest to Dr. Adams to-day when I hand him this letter,\nthat in the event of my failure to return within a week, he make some\nadequate provision for guarding the ring in safety. And I must caution\nyou now, before starting to join me, if you conclude to do so, that you\ncontinue this provision, so as to make possible your safe return to your\nown world.\n\n\"'If our country is at war at the time you read this, your duty is\nplain. I have no fears regarding your course of action. But if not, I do\nnot care to influence unduly your decision about venturing into this\nunknown other world. The danger into which I personally may have fallen\nmust count for little with you, in a decision to hazard your own lives.\nI may point out, however, that such a journey successfully accomplished\ncannot fail but be the greatest contribution to science that has ever\nbeen made. Nor can I doubt but that your coming may prove of tremendous\nbenefit to the humanity of this other equally important, though, in our\neyes, infinitesimal world.\n\n\"'I therefore suggest, gentlemen, that you start your journey into the\nring at 8 P. M. on the evening of November 4, 1923. You will do your\nbest to find your way direct to the city of Arite, where, if I am alive,\nI will be awaiting you.'\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nTESTING THE DRUGS\n\n\nThe Doctor laid his papers on the table and looked up into the white\nfaces of the three men facing him. \"That's all, gentlemen,\" he said.\n\nFor a moment no one spoke, and on the face of each was plainly written\nthe evidence of an emotion too deep for words. The Doctor sorted out the\npapers in silence, glanced over them for a moment, and then reached for\na large metal ash tray that stood near him on the table. Taking a match\nfrom his pocket he calmly lighted a corner of the papers and dropped\nthem burning into the metal bowl. His friends watched him in awed\nsilence; only the Very Young Man found words to protest.\n\n\"Say now, wait,\" he began, \"why----\"\n\nThe Doctor looked at him. \"The letter requests me to do that,\" he said.\n\n\"But I say, the formulas----\" persisted the Very Young Man, looking\nwildly at the burning papers.\n\nThe Doctor held up one of the white tin boxes lying on the arm of his\nchair.\n\n\"In these tins,\" he said, \"I have vials containing the specified\nquantity of each drug. It is ample for our purpose. I have done my best\nto memorize the formulas. But in any event, I was directed to burn them\nat the time of reading you the letter. I have done so.\"\n\nThe Big Business Man came out of a brown study.\n\n\"Just three weeks from to-night,\" he murmured, \"three weeks from\nto-night. It's too big to realize.\"\n\nThe Doctor put the two boxes on the table, turned his chair back toward\nthe others, and lighted a cigar.\n\n\"Gentlemen, let us go over this matter thoroughly,\" he began. \"We have a\nmomentous decision to make. Either we destroy those boxes and their\ncontents, or three weeks from to-night some or all of us start our\njourney into the ring. I have had a month to think this matter over; I\nhave made my decision.\n\n\"I know there is much for you to consider, before you can each of you\nchoose your course of action. It is not my desire or intention to\ninfluence you one way or the other. But we can, if you wish, discuss the\nmatter here to-night; or we can wait, if you prefer, until each of you\nhas had time to think it out for himself.\"\n\n\"I'm going,\" the Very Young Man burst out.\n\nHis hands were gripping the arms of his chair tightly; his face was very\npale, but his eyes sparkled.\n\nThe Doctor turned to him gravely.\n\n\"Your life is at stake, my boy,\" he said, \"this is not a matter for\nimpulse.\"\n\n\"I'm going whether any one else does or not,\" persisted the Very Young\nMan. \"You can't stop me, either,\" he added doggedly. \"That letter\nsaid----\"\n\nThe Doctor smiled at the youth's earnestness. Then abruptly he held out\nhis hand.\n\n\"There is no use my holding back my own decision. I am going to attempt\nthe trip. And since, as you say, I cannot stop you from going,\" he added\nwith a twinkle, \"that makes two of us.\"\n\nThey shook hands. The Very Young Man lighted a cigarette, and began\npacing up and down the room, staring hard at the floor.\n\n\"I can remember trying to imagine how I would feel,\" began the Big\nBusiness Man slowly, \"if Rogers had asked me to go with him when he\nfirst went into the ring. It is not a new idea to me, for I have thought\nabout it many times in the abstract, during the past five years. But now\nthat I am face to face with it in reality, it sort of----\" He broke off,\nand smiled helplessly around at his companions.\n\nThe Very Young Man stopped in his walk. \"Aw, come on in,\" he began,\n\"the----\"\n\n\"Shut up,\" growled the Banker, speaking for the first time in many\nminutes.\n\n\"I'm sure we would all like to go,\" said the Doctor. \"The point is,\nwhich of us are best fitted for the trip.\"\n\n\"None of us are married,\" put in the Very Young Man.\n\n\"I've been thinking----\" began the Banker. \"Suppose we get into the\nring--how long would we be gone, do you suppose?\"\n\n\"Who can say?\" answered the Doctor smiling. \"Perhaps a month--a\nyear--many years possibly. That is one of the hazards of the venture.\"\n\nThe Banker went on thoughtfully. \"Do you remember that argument we had\nwith Rogers about time? Time goes twice as fast, didn't he say, in that\nother world?\"\n\n\"Two and a half times faster, if I remember rightly, he estimated,\"\nreplied the Doctor.\n\nThe Banker looked at his skinny hands a moment. \"I owned up to\nsixty-four once,\" he said quizzically. \"Two years and a half in one\nyear. No, I guess I'll let you young fellows tackle that; I'll stay here\nin this world where things don't move so fast.\"\n\n\"Somebody's got to stay,\" said the Very Young Man. \"By golly, you know\nif we're all going into that ring it would be pretty sad to have\nanything happen to it while we were gone.\"\n\n\"That's so,\" said the Banker, looking relieved. \"I never thought of\nthat.\"\n\n\"One of us should stay at least,\" said the Doctor. \"We cannot take any\noutsider into our confidence. One of us must watch the others go, and\nthen take the ring back to its place in the Museum. We will be gone too\nlong a time for one person to watch it here.\"\n\nThe Very Young Man suddenly went to one of the doors and locked it.\n\n\"We don't want any one coming in,\" he explained as he crossed the room\nand locked the others.\n\n\"And another thing,\" he went on, coming back to the table. \"When I saw\nthe ring at the Biological Society the other day, I happened to think,\nsuppose Rogers was to come out on the underneath side? It was lying\nflat, you know, just as it is now.\" He pointed to where the ring lay on\nthe handkerchief before them. \"I meant to speak to you about it,\" he\nadded.\n\n\"I thought of that,\" said the Doctor. \"When I had that case built to\nbring the ring here, you notice I raised it above the bottom a little,\nholding it suspended in that wire frame.\"\n\n\"We'd better fix up something like that at the Museum, too,\" said the\nVery Young Man, and went back to his walk.\n\nThe Big Business Man had been busily jotting down figures on the back of\nan envelope. \"I can be in shape to go in three weeks,\" he said suddenly.\n\n\"Bully for you,\" said the Very Young Man. \"Then it's all settled.\" The\nBig Business Man went back to his notes.\n\n\"I knew what your answer would be,\" said the Doctor. \"My patients can go\nto the devil. This is too big a thing.\"\n\nThe Very Young Man picked up one of the tin boxes. \"Tell us how you made\nthe powders,\" he suggested.\n\nThe Doctor took the two boxes and opened them. Inside each were a number\nof tiny glass vials. Those in one box were of blue glass; those in the\nother were red.\n\n\"These vials,\" said the Doctor, \"contain tiny pellets of the completed\ndrug. That for diminishing size I have put in the red vials; those of\nblue are the other drug.\n\n\"I had rather a difficult time making them--that is, compared to what I\nanticipated. Most of the chemicals I bought without difficulty. But when\nI came to compound those two myself\"--the Doctor smiled--\"I used to\nthink I was a fair chemist in my student days. But now--well, at least I\ngot the results, but only because I have been working almost night and\nday for the past month. And I found myself with a remarkably complete\nexperimental laboratory when I finished,\" he added. \"That was yesterday;\nI spent nearly all last night destroying the apparatus, as soon as I\nfound that the drugs had been properly made.\"\n\n\"They do work?\" said the Very Young Man anxiously.\n\n\"They work,\" answered the Doctor. \"I tried them both very carefully.\"\n\n\"On yourself?\" said the Big Business Man.\n\n\"No, I didn't think that necessary. I used several insects.\"\n\n\"Let's try them now,\" suggested the Very Young Man eagerly.\n\n\"Not the big one,\" said the Banker. \"Once was enough for that.\"\n\n\"All right,\" the Doctor laughed. \"We'll try the other if you like.\"\n\nThe Big Business Man looked around the room. \"There's a few flies around\nhere if we can catch one,\" he suggested.\n\n\"I'll bet there's a cockroach in the kitchen,\" said the Very Young Man,\njumping up.\n\nThe Doctor took a brass check from his pocket. \"I thought probably you'd\nwant to try them out. Will you get that box from the check-room?\" He\nhanded the check to the Very Young Man, who hurried out of the room. He\nreturned in a moment, gingerly carrying a cardboard box with holes\nperforated in the top. The Doctor took the box and lifted the lid\ncarefully. Inside, the box was partitioned into two compartments. In one\ncompartment were three little lizards about four inches long; in the\nother were two brown sparrows. The Doctor took out one of the sparrows\nand replaced the cover.\n\n\"Fine,\" said the Very Young Man with enthusiasm.\n\nThe Doctor reached for the boxes of chemicals.\n\n\"Not the big one,\" said the Banker again, apprehensively.\n\n\"Hold him, will you,\" the Doctor said.\n\nThe Very Young Man took the sparrow in his hands.\n\n\"Now,\" continued the Doctor, \"what we need is a plate and a little\nwater.\"\n\n\"There's a tray,\" said the Very Young Man, pointing with his hands\nholding the sparrow.\n\nThe Doctor took a spoon from the tray and put a little water in it. Then\nhe took one of the tiny pellets from a red vial and crushing it in his\nfingers, sprinkled a few grains into that water.\n\n\"Hold that a moment, please.\" The Big Business Man took the proffered\nspoon.\n\nThen the Doctor produced from his pocket a magnifying glass and a tiny\npair of silver callipers such as are used by jewelers for handling small\nobjects.\n\n\"What's the idea?\" the Very Young Man wanted to know.\n\n\"I thought I'd try and put him on the ring,\" explained the Doctor. \"Now,\nthen hold open his beak.\"\n\nThe Very Young Man did so, and the Doctor poured the water down the\nbird's throat. Most of it spilled; the sparrow twisted its head\nviolently, but evidently some of the liquid had gone down the bird's\nthroat.\n\nSilence followed, broken after a moment by the scared voice of the Very\nYoung Man. \"He's getting smaller, I can feel him. He's getting smaller.\"\n\n\"Hold on to him,\" cautioned the Doctor. \"Bring him over here.\" They went\nover to the table by the ring, the Banker and the Big Business Man\nstanding close beside them.\n\n\"Suppose he tries to fly when we let go of him,\" suggested the Very\nYoung Man almost in a whisper.\n\n\"He'll probably be too confused,\" answered the Doctor. \"Have you got\nhim?\" The sparrow was hardly bigger than a large horse-fly now, and the\nVery Young Man was holding it between his thumb and forefinger.\n\n\"Better give him to me,\" said the Doctor. \"Set him down.\"\n\n\"He might fly away,\" remonstrated the Very Young Man.\n\n\"No, he won't.\"\n\nThe Very Young Man put the sparrow on the handkerchief beside the ring\nand the Doctor immediately picked it up with the callipers.\n\n\"Don't squeeze him,\" cautioned the Very Young Man.\n\nThe sparrow grew steadily smaller, and in a moment the Doctor set it\ncarefully on the rim of the ring.\n\n\"Get him up by the scratch,\" whispered the Very Young Man.\n\nThe men bent closer over the table, as the Doctor looking through his\nmagnifying glass shoved the sparrow slowly along the top of the ring.\n\n\"I can't see him,\" said the Banker.\n\n\"I can,\" said the Very Young Man, \"right by the scratch.\" Then after a\nmoment, \"he's gone.\"\n\n\"I've got him right over the scratch,\" said the Doctor, leaning farther\ndown. Then he raised his head and laid the magnifying glass and the\ncallipers on the table. \"He's gone now.\"\n\n\"Gosh,\" said the Very Young Man, drawing a long breath.\n\nThe Banker flung himself into a chair as though exhausted from a great\nphysical effort.\n\n\"Well, it certainly does work,\" said the Big Business Man, \"there's no\nquestion about that.\"\n\nThe Very Young Man was shaking the cardboard box in his hands and\nlifting its cover cautiously to see inside. \"Let's try a lizard,\" he\nsuggested.\n\n\"Oh, what's the use,\" the Banker protested wearily, \"we know it works.\"\n\n\"Well, it can't hurt anything to try it, can it?\" the Very Young Man\nurged. \"Besides, the more we try it, the more sure we are it will work\nwith us when the time comes. You don't want to try it on yourself, now,\ndo you?\" he added with a grin.\n\n\"No, thank you,\" retorted the Banker with emphasis.\n\n\"I think we might as well try it again,\" said the Big Business Man.\n\nThe Very Young Man took one of the tiny lizards from the box, and in a\nmoment they had dropped some water containing the drug down its throat.\n\"Try to put him on the scratch, too,\" said the Very Young Man.\n\nWhen the lizard was small enough the Doctor held it with the callipers\nand then laid it on the ring.\n\n\"Look at him walk; look at him walk,\" whispered the Very Young Man\nexcitedly. The lizard, hardly more than an eighth of an inch long now,\nbut still plainly visible, was wriggling along the top of the ring.\n\"Shove him up by the scratch,\" he added.\n\nIn a moment more the reptile was too small for any but the Doctor with\nhis glass to see. \"I guess he got there,\" he said finally with a smile,\nas he straightened up. \"He was going fast.\"\n\n\"Well, _that's_ all right,\" said the Very Young Man with a sigh of\nrelief.\n\nThe four men again seated themselves; the Big Business Man went back to\nhis figures.\n\n\"When do you start?\" asked the Banker after a moment.\n\n\"November 4th--8 P. M.,\" answered the Doctor. \"Three weeks from\nto-night.\"\n\n\"We've a lot to do,\" said the Banker.\n\n\"What will this cost, do you figure?\" asked the Big Business Man,\nlooking up from his notes.\n\nThe Doctor considered a moment.\n\n\"We can't take much with us, you know,\" he said slowly. Then he\ntook a sheet of memoranda from his pockets. \"I have already spent\nfor apparatus and chemicals to prepare the drugs\"--he consulted his\nfigures--\"seventeen hundred and forty dollars, total. What we have still\nto spend will be very little, I should think. I propose we divide it\nthree ways as we have been doing with the Museum?\"\n\n\"Four ways,\" said the Very Young Man. \"I'm no kid any more. I got a good\njob--that is,\" he added with a rueful air, \"I had a good job. To-morrow\nI quit.\"\n\n\"Four ways,\" the Doctor corrected himself gravely. \"I guess we can\nmanage that.\"\n\n\"What can we take with us, do you think?\" asked the Big Business Man.\n\n\"I think we should try strapping a belt around our waists, with pouches\nin it,\" said the Doctor. \"I doubt if it would contract with our bodies,\nbut still it might. If it didn't there would be no harm done; we could\nleave it behind.\"\n\n\"You want food and water,\" said the Banker. \"Remember that barren\ncountry you are going through.\"\n\n\"And something on our feet,\" the Big Business Man put in.\n\n\"I'd like to take a revolver, too,\" said the Very Young Man. \"It might\ncome in awful handy.\"\n\n\"As I remember Rogers's description,\" said the Doctor thoughtfully, \"the\ntrip out is more difficult than going down. We mustn't overlook\npreparations for that; it is most imperative we should be careful.\"\n\n\"Say, talking about getting back,\" burst out the Very Young Man. \"I'd\nlike to see that other drug work first. It would be pretty rotten to get\nin there and have it go back on us, wouldn't it? Oh, golly!\" The Very\nYoung Man sank back in his chair overcome by the picture he had conjured\nup.\n\n\"I tried it,\" said the Doctor. \"It works.\"\n\n\"I'd like to see it again with something different,\" said the Big\nBusiness Man. \"It can't do any harm.\" The Banker looked his protest, but\nsaid nothing.\n\n\"What shall we try, a lizard?\" suggested the Very Young Man. The Doctor\nshrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"What'll we kill it with? Oh, I know.\" The Very Young Man picked up a\nheavy metal paper-weight from the desk. \"This'll do the trick, fine,\" he\nadded.\n\nThen, laying the paper-weight carefully aside, he dipped up a spoonful\nof water and offered it to the Doctor.\n\n\"Not that water this time,\" said the Doctor, shaking his head with a\nsmile.\n\nThe Very Young Man looked blank.\n\n\"Organisms in it,\" the Doctor explained briefly. \"All right for them to\nget small from the other chemical, but we don't want them to get large\nand come out at us, do we?\"\n\n\"Holy Smoke, I should say not,\" said the Very Young Man, gasping; and\nthe Banker growled:\n\n\"Something's going to happen to us, playing with fire like this.\"\n\nThe Doctor produced a little bottle. \"I boiled this water,\" he said. \"We\ncan use this.\"\n\nIt took but a moment to give the other drug to one of the remaining\nlizards, although they spilled more of the water than went down its\nthroat.\n\n\"Don't forget to hit him, and don't you wait very long,\" said the Banker\nwarningly, moving nearer the door.\n\n\"Oh, I'll hit him all right, don't worry,\" said the Very Young Man,\nbrandishing the paper-weight.\n\nThe Doctor knelt down, and held the reptile pinned to the floor; the\nVery Young Man knelt beside him. Slowly the lizard began to increase in\nsize.\n\n\"He's growing,\" said the Banker. \"Hit him, boy, what's the use of\nwaiting; he's growing.\"\n\nThe lizard was nearly a foot long now, and struggling violently between\nthe Doctor's fingers.\n\n\"You'd better kill him,\" said the Doctor, \"he might get away from me.\"\nThe Very Young Man obediently brought his weapon down with a thump upon\nthe reptile's head.\n\n\"Keep on,\" said the Banker. \"Be sure he's dead.\"\n\nThe Very Young Man pounded the quivering body for a moment. The Big\nBusiness Man handed him a napkin from the tray and the Very Young Man\nwrapped up the lizard and threw it into the waste-basket.\n\nThen he rose to his feet and tossed the paper-weight on to the desk with\na crash.\n\n\"Well, gentlemen,\" he said, turning back to them with flushed face,\n\"those drugs sure do work. We're going into the ring all right, three\nweeks from to-night, and nothing on earth can stop us.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nTHE ESCAPE OF THE DRUG\n\n\nFor the next hour the four friends busily planned their preparations for\nthe journey. When they began to discuss the details of the trip, and\nfound themselves face to face with so hazardous an adventure, each\ndiscovered a hundred things in his private life that needed attention.\n\nThe Doctor's phrase, \"My patients can go to the devil,\" seemed to\nrelieve his mind of all further responsibility towards his personal\naffairs.\n\n\"That's all very well for you,\" said the Big Business Man, \"I've too\nmany irons in the fire just to drop everything--there are too many other\npeople concerned. And I've got to plan as though I were never coming\nback, you know.\"\n\n\"Your troubles are easy,\" said the Very Young Man. \"I've got a girl. I\nwonder what she'll say. Oh, gosh, I can't tell her where I'm going, can\nI? I never thought of that.\" He scratched his head with a perplexed air.\n\"That's tough on her. Well, I'm glad I'm an orphan, anyway.\"\n\nThe actual necessities of the trip needed a little discussion, for what\nthey could take with them amounted to practically nothing.\n\n\"As I understand it,\" said the Banker, \"all I have to do is watch you\nstart, and then take the ring back to the Museum.\"\n\n\"Take it carefully,\" continued the Very Young Man. \"Remember what it's\ngot in it.\"\n\n\"You will give us about two hours to get well started down,\" said the\nDoctor. \"After that it will be quite safe to move the ring. You can take\nit back to the Society in that case I brought it here in.\"\n\n\"Be sure you take it yourself,\" put in the Very Young Man. \"Don't trust\nit to anybody else. And how about having that wire rack fixed for it at\nthe Museum,\" he added. \"Don't forget that.\"\n\n\"I'll have that done myself this week,\" said the Doctor.\n\nThey had been talking for perhaps an hour when the Banker got up from\nhis chair to get a fresh cigar from a box that lay upon the desk. He\nhappened to glance across the room and on the floor in the corner by the\nclosed door he saw a long, flat object that had not been there before.\nIt was out of the circle of light and being brown against the polished\nhardwood floor, he could not make it out clearly. But something about it\nfrightened him.\n\n\"What's that over there?\" he asked, standing still and pointing.\n\nThe Big Business Man rose from his seat and took a few steps in the\ndirection of the Banker's outstretched hand. Then with a muttered oath\nhe jumped to the desk in a panic and picking up the heavy paper-weight\nflung it violently across the room. It struck the panelled wall with a\ncrash and bounded back towards him. At the same instant there came a\nscuttling sound from the floor, and a brown shape slid down the edge of\nthe room and stopped in the other corner.\n\nAll four men were on their feet in an instant, white-faced and\ntrembling.\n\n\"Good God,\" said the Big Business Man huskily, \"that thing over\nthere--that----\"\n\n\"Turn on the side lights--the side lights!\" shouted the Doctor, running\nacross the room.\n\nIn the glare of the unshaded globes on the wall the room was brightly\nlighted. On the floor in the corner the horrified men saw a cockroach\nnearly eighteen inches in length, with its head facing the angle of\nwall, and scratching with its legs against the base board as though\nabout to climb up. For a moment the men stood silent with surprise and\nterror. Then, as they stared they saw the cockroach was getting larger.\nThe Big Business Man laid his hand on the Doctor's arm with a grip that\nmade the Doctor wince.\n\n\"Good God, man, look at it--it's growing,\" he said in a voice hardly\nabove a whisper.\n\n\"It's growing,\" echoed the Very Young Man; \"_it's growing_!\"\n\nAnd then the truth dawned upon them, and brought with it confusion,\nalmost panic. The cockroach, fully two feet long now, had raised the\nfront end of its body a foot above the floor, and was reaching up the\nwall with its legs.\n\nThe Banker made a dash for the opposite door. \"Let's get out of here.\nCome on!\" he shouted.\n\nThe Doctor stopped him. Of the four men, he was the only one who had\nretained his self-possession.\n\n\"Listen to me,\" he said. His voice trembled a little in spite of his\nefforts to control it. \"Listen to me. That--that--thing cannot harm us\nyet.\" He looked from one to the other of them and spoke swiftly. \"It's\ngruesome and--and loathsome, but it is not dangerous--yet. But we cannot\nrun from it. We must kill it--here, now, before it gets any larger.\"\n\nThe Banker tore himself loose and started again towards the door.\n\n\"You fool!\" said the Doctor, with a withering look. \"Don't you see, it's\nlife or death later. That--that thing will be as big as this house in\nhalf an hour. Don't you know that? As big as this house. We've got to\nkill it now--now.\"\n\nThe Big Business Man ran towards the paper-weight. \"I'll hit it with\nthis,\" he said.\n\n\"You can't,\" said the Doctor, \"you might miss. We haven't time. Look at\nit,\" he added.\n\nThe cockroach was noticeably larger now--considerably over two feet; it\nhad turned away from the wall to face them.\n\nThe Very Young Man had said nothing; only stood and stared with\nbloodless face and wide-open eyes. Then suddenly he stooped, and picking\nup a small rug from the floor--a rug some six feet long and half as\nwide--advanced slowly towards the cockroach.\n\n\"That's the idea,\" encouraged the Doctor. \"Get it under that. Here, give\nme part of it.\" He grasped a corner of the rug. \"You two go up the other\nsides\"--he pointed with his free hand--\"and head it off if it runs.\"\n\nSlowly the four men crept forward. The cockroach, three feet long now,\nwas a hideous, horrible object as it stood backed into the corner of the\nroom, the front part of its body swaying slowly from side to side.\n\n\"We'd better make a dash for it,\" whispered the Very Young Man; and\njerking the rug loose from the Doctor's grasp, he leaped forward and\nflung himself headlong upon the floor, with the rug completely under\nhim.\n\n\"I've got the damned thing. I've got it!\" he shouted. \"Help--you. Help!\"\n\nThe three men leaped with him upon the rug, holding it pinned to the\nfloor. The Very Young Man, as he lay, could feel the curve of the great\nbody underneath, and could hear the scratch of its many legs upon the\nfloor.\n\n\"Hold down the edges of the rug!\" he cried. \"Don't let it out. Don't let\nit get out. I'll smash it.\" He raised himself on his hands and knees,\nand came down heavily. The rug gave under his thrust as the insect\nflattened out; then they could hear again the muffled scratching of its\nlegs upon the floor as it raised the rug up under the Very Young Man's\nweight.\n\n\"We can't kill it,\" panted the Big Business Man. \"Oh, we can't kill it.\nGood God, how big it is!\"\n\nThe Very Young Man got to his feet and stood on the bulge of the rug.\nThen he jumped into the air and landed solidly on his heels. There was a\nsharp crack as the shell of the insect broke under the sharpness of his\nblow.\n\n\"That did it; that'll do it!\" he shouted. Then he leaped again.\n\n\"Let me,\" said the Big Business Man. \"I'm heavier\"; and he, too, stamped\nupon the rug with his heels.\n\nThey could hear the huge shell of the insect's back smash under his\nweight, and when he jumped again, the squash of its body as he mashed it\ndown.\n\n\"Wait,\" said the Doctor. \"We've killed it.\"\n\nThey eased upon the rug a little, but there was no movement from\nbeneath.\n\n\"Jump on it harder,\" said the Very Young Man. \"Don't let's take a\nchance. Mash it good.\"\n\nThe Big Business Man continued stamping violently upon the rug; joined\nnow by the Very Young Man. The Doctor sat on the floor beside it,\nbreathing heavily; the Banker lay in a heap at its foot in utter\ncollapse.\n\nAs they stamped, the rug continued to flatten down; it sank under their\ntread with a horrible, sickening, squashing sound.\n\n\"Let's look,\" suggested the Very Young Man. \"It must be dead\"; and he\nthrew back a corner of the rug. The men turned sick and faint at what\nthey saw.\n\nUnderneath the rug, mashed against the floor, lay a great, noisome,\nsemi-liquid mass of brown and white. It covered nearly the entire\nunder-surface of the rug--a hundred pounds, perhaps, of loathsome pulp\nand shell, from which a stench arose that stopped their breathing.\n\nWith a muttered imprecation the Doctor flung back the rug to cover it,\nand sprang to his feet, steadying himself against a chair.\n\n\"We killed it in time, thank God,\" he murmured and dropped into the\nchair, burying his face in his hands.\n\nFor a time silence fell upon the room, broken only by the labored\nbreathing of the four men. Then the Big Business Man sat up suddenly.\n\"Oh, my God, what an experience!\" he groaned, and got unsteadily to his\nfeet.\n\nThe Very Young Man helped the Banker up and led him to a seat by the\nwindow, which he opened, letting in the fresh, cool air of the night.\n\n\"How did the drug get loose, do you suppose?\" asked the Very Young Man,\ncoming back to the center of the room. He had recovered his composure\nsomewhat, though he was still very pale. He lighted a cigarette and sat\ndown beside the Doctor.\n\nThe Doctor raised his head wearily. \"I suppose we must have spilled some\nof it on the floor,\" he said, \"and the cockroach----\" He stopped\nabruptly and sprang to his feet.\n\n\"Good God!\" he cried. \"Suppose another one----\"\n\nOn the bare floor beside the table they came upon a few drops of water.\n\n\"That must be it,\" said the Doctor. He pulled his handkerchief from his\npocket; then he stopped in thought. \"No, that won't do. What shall we do\nwith it?\" he added. \"We must destroy it absolutely. Good Lord, if that\ndrug ever gets loose upon the world----\"\n\nThe Big Business Man joined them.\n\n\"We must destroy it absolutely,\" repeated the Doctor. \"We can't just\nwipe it up.\"\n\n\"Some acid,\" suggested the Big Business Man.\n\n\"Suppose something else has got at it already,\" the Very Young Man said\nin a scared voice, and began hastily looking around the floor of the\nroom.\n\n\"You're right,\" agreed the Doctor. \"We mustn't take any chance; we must\nlook thoroughly.\"\n\nJoined by the Banker, the four men began carefully going over the room.\n\n\"You'd better watch that nothing gets at it,\" the Very Young Man thought\nsuddenly to say. The Banker obediently sat down by the little pool of\nwater on the floor.\n\n\"And I'll close the window,\" added the Very Young Man; \"something might\nget out.\"\n\nThey searched the room thoroughly, carefully scanning its walls and\nceiling, but could see nothing out of the ordinary.\n\n\"We'll never be quite sure,\" said the Doctor finally, \"but I guess we're\nsafe. It's the best we can do now, at any rate.\"\n\nHe joined the Banker by the table. \"I'll get some nitric acid,\" he\nadded. \"I don't know what else----\"\n\n\"We'll have to get that out of here, too,\" said the Big Business Man,\npointing to the rug. \"God knows how we'll explain it.\"\n\nThe Doctor picked up one of the tin boxes of drugs and held it in his\nhand meditatively. Then he looked over towards the rug. From under one\nside a brownish liquid was oozing; the Doctor shuddered.\n\n\"My friends,\" he said, holding up the box before them, \"we can realize\nnow something of the terrible power we have created and imprisoned here.\nWe must guard it carefully, gentlemen, for if it escapes--it will\ndestroy the world.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nTHE START\n\n\nOn the evening of November 4th, 1923, the four friends again assembled\nat the Scientific Club for the start of their momentous adventure. The\nDoctor was the last to arrive, and found the other three anxiously\nawaiting him. He brought with him the valise containing the ring and a\nsuitcase with the drugs and equipment necessary for the journey. He\ngreeted his friends gravely.\n\n\"The time has come, gentlemen,\" he said, putting the suitcase on the\ntable.\n\nThe Big Business Man took out the ring and held it in his hand\nthoughtfully.\n\n\"The scene of our new life,\" he said with emotion. \"What does it hold in\nstore for us?\"\n\n\"What time is it?\" asked the Very Young Man. \"We've got to hurry. We\nwant to get started on time--we mustn't be late.\"\n\n\"Everything's ready, isn't it?\" asked the Banker. \"Who has the belts?\"\n\n\"They're in my suitcase,\" answered the Very Young Man. \"There it is.\"\n\nThe Doctor laid the ring and handkerchief on the floor under the light\nand began unpacking from his bag the drugs and the few small articles\nthey had decided to try and take with them. \"You have the food and\nwater,\" he said.\n\nThe Big Business Man produced three small flasks of water and six flat,\nsquare tins containing compressed food. The Very Young Man opened one of\nthem. \"Chocolate soldiers we are,\" he said, and laughed.\n\nThe Banker was visibly nervous and just a little frightened. \"Are you\nsure you haven't forgotten something?\" he asked, quaveringly.\n\n\"It wouldn't make a great deal of difference if we had,\" said the\nDoctor, with a smile. \"The belts may not contract with us at all; we may\nhave to leave them behind.\"\n\n\"Rogers didn't take anything,\" put in the Very Young Man. \"Come on;\nlet's get undressed.\"\n\nThe Banker locked the doors and sat down to watch the men make their\nlast preparations. They spoke little while they were disrobing; the\nsolemnity of what they were about to do both awed and frightened them.\nOnly the Very Young Man seemed exhilarated by the excitement of the\ncoming adventure.\n\nIn a few moments the three men were dressed in their white woolen\nbathing suits. The Very Young Man was the first to be fully equipped.\n\n\"I'm ready,\" he announced. \"All but the chemicals. Where are they?\"\n\nAround his waist he had strapped a broad cloth belt, with a number of\npockets fastened to it. On his feet were felt-lined cloth shoes, with\nhard rubber soles; he wore a wrist watch. Under each armpit was fastened\nthe pouch for carrying the drugs.\n\n\"Left arm for red vials,\" said the Doctor. \"Be sure of that--we mustn't\nget them mixed. Take two of each color.\" He handed the Very Young Man\nthe tin boxes.\n\nAll the men were ready in a moment more.\n\n\"Five minutes of eight,\" said the Very Young Man, looking at his watch.\n\"We're right on time; let's get started.\"\n\nThe Banker stood up among them. \"Tell me what I've got to do,\" he said\nhelplessly. \"You're going all but me; I'll be left behind alone.\"\n\nThe Big Business Man laid his hand on the Banker's shoulder\naffectionately. \"Don't look so sad, George,\" he said, with an attempt at\nlevity. \"We're not leaving you forever--we're coming back.\"\n\nThe Banker pressed his friend's hand. His usual crusty manner was quite\ngone now; he seemed years older.\n\nThe Doctor produced the same spoon he had used when the Chemist made his\ndeparture into the ring. \"I've kept it all this time,\" he said, smiling.\n\"Perhaps it will bring us luck.\" He handed it to the Banker.\n\n\"What you have to do is this,\" he continued seriously. \"We shall all\ntake an equal amount of the drug at the same instant. I hope it will act\nupon each of us at the same rate, so that we may diminish uniformly in\nsize, and thus keep together.\"\n\n\"Gosh!\" said the Very Young Man. \"I never thought of that. Suppose it\ndoesn't?\"\n\n\"Then we shall have to adjust the difference by taking other smaller\namounts of the drug. But I think probably it will.\n\n\"You must be ready,\" he went on to the Banker, \"to help us on to the\nring if necessary.\"\n\n\"Or put us back if we fall off,\" said the Very Young Man. \"I'm going to\nsit still until I'm pretty small. Gracious, it's going to feel funny.\"\n\n\"After we have disappeared,\" continued the Doctor, \"you will wait, say,\nuntil eleven o'clock. Watch the ring carefully--some of us may have to\ncome back before that time. At eleven o'clock pack up everything\"--he\nlooked around the littered room with a smile--\"and take the ring back to\nthe Biological Society.\"\n\n\"Keep your eye on it on the way back,\" warned the Very Young Man.\n\"Suppose we decide to come out some time later to-night--you can't\ntell.\"\n\n\"I'll watch it all night to-night, here and at the Museum,\" said the\nBanker, mopping his forehead.\n\n\"Good scheme,\" said the Very Young Man approvingly. \"Anything might\nhappen.\"\n\n\"Well, gentlemen,\" said the Doctor, \"I believe we're all ready. Come on,\nWill.\"\n\nThe Big Business Man was standing by the window, looking out intently.\nHe evidently did not hear the remark addressed to him, for he paid no\nattention. The Doctor joined him.\n\nThrough the window they could see the street below, crowded now with\nscurrying automobiles. The sidewalks were thronged with\npeople--theater-goers, hurrying forward, seeking eagerly their evening's\npleasure. It had been raining, and the wet pavements shone with long,\nblurred yellow glints from the thousands of lights above. Down the\nstreet they could see a huge blazing theater sign, with the name of a\npopular actress spelt in letters of fire.\n\nThe Big Business Man threw up the window sash and took a deep breath of\nthe moist, cool air of the night.\n\n\"Good-by, old world,\" he murmured with emotion. \"Shall I see you again,\nI wonder?\" He stood a moment longer, silently staring at the scene\nbefore him. Then abruptly he closed the window, pulled down the shade,\nand turned back to the room.\n\n\"Come on,\" said the Very Young Man impatiently. \"It's five minutes after\neight. Let's get started.\"\n\n\"Just one thing before we start,\" said the Doctor, as they gathered in\nthe center of the room. \"We must understand, gentlemen, from the moment\nwe first take the drug, until we reach our final smallest size, it is\nimperative, or at least highly desirable, that we keep together. We\nstart by taking four of the pellets each, according to the memoranda\nRogers left. By Jove!\" he interrupted himself, \"that's one thing\nimportant we did nearly forget.\"\n\nHe went to his coat, and from his wallet took several typewritten sheets\nof paper.\n\n\"I made three copies,\" he said, handing them to his companions. \"Put\nthem away carefully; the front pocket will be most convenient, probably.\n\n\"It may not be hard for us to keep together,\" continued the Doctor. \"On\nthe other hand, we may find it extremely difficult, if not quite\nimpossible. In the latter event we will meet at the city of Arite.\n\n\"There are two things we must consider. First, we shall be constantly\nchanging size with relation to our surroundings. In proportion to each\nother, we must remain normal in size if we can. Secondly we shall be\ntraveling--changing position in our surroundings. So far as that aspect\nof the trip is concerned, it will not be more difficult for us to keep\ntogether, probably, than during any adventurous journey here in this\nworld.\n\n\"If through accident or any unforeseen circumstance we are separated in\nsize, the one being smallest shall wait for the others. That can be\naccomplished by taking a very small quantity of the other drug--probably\nmerely by touching one of the pellets to the tongue. Do I make myself\nclear?\" His friends nodded assent.\n\n\"If any great separation in relative size occurs,\" the Doctor went on,\n\"a discrepancy sufficient to make the smallest of us invisible for a\ntime to the others, then another problem presents itself. We must be\nvery careful, in that event, not to change our position in space--not to\nkeep on traveling, in other words--or else, when we become the same size\nonce more, we will be out of sight of one another. Geographically\nseparated, so to speak,\" the Doctor finished with a smile.\n\n\"I am so explicit on this point of keeping together,\" he continued,\n\"because--well, I personally do not want to undertake even part of this\njourney alone.\"\n\n\"You're darn right--me neither,\" agreed the Very Young Man emphatically.\n\"Let's get going.\"\n\n\"I guess that's all,\" said the Doctor, with a last glance around, and\nfinally facing the Banker. \"Good-by, George.\"\n\nThe Banker was quite overcome, and without a word he shook hands with\neach of his friends.\n\nThe three men sat beside each other on the floor, close to the\nhandkerchief and ring; the Banker sat in his chair on the other side,\nfacing them, spoon in hand. In silence they each took four of the\npellets. Then the Banker saw them close their eyes; he saw the Big\nBusiness Man put his hands suddenly on the floor as though to steady\nhimself.\n\nThe Banker gripped the arms of his chair firmly. He knew exactly what to\nexpect, yet now when his friends began slowly to diminish in size he was\nfilled with surprise and horror. For several minutes no one spoke. Then\nthe Very Young Man opened his eyes, looked around dizzily for an\ninstant, and began feeling with his hands the belt at his waist, his\nshoes, wrist-watch, and the pouches under his armpits.\n\n\"It's all right,\" he said with an enthusiasm that contrasted strangely\nwith the tremor in his voice. \"The belt's getting smaller, too. We're\ngoing to be able to take everything with us.\"\n\nAgain silence fell on the room, broken only by the sound of the three\nmen on the floor continually shifting their positions as they grew\nsmaller. In another moment the Doctor clambered unsteadily to his feet\nand, taking a step backward, leaned up against the cylindrical mahogany\nleg of the center-table, flinging his arms around it. His head did not\nreach the table-top.\n\nThe Very Young Man and the Big Business Man were on their feet now, too,\nstanding at the edge of the handkerchief, and clinging to one another\nfor support. The Banker looked down at them and tried to smile. The Very\nYoung Man waved his hand, and the Banker found voice to say: \"Good-by,\nmy boy.\"\n\n\"Good-by, sir,\" echoed the Very Young Man. \"We're making it.\"\n\nSteadily they grew smaller. By this time the Doctor had become far too\nsmall for his arms to encircle the leg of the table. The Banker looked\ndown to the floor, and saw him standing beside the table leg, leaning\none hand against it as one would lean against the great stone column of\nsome huge building.\n\n\"Good-by, Frank,\" said the Banker. But the Doctor did not answer; he\nseemed lost in thought.\n\nSeveral minutes more passed in silence. The three men had diminished in\nsize now until they were not more than three inches high. Suddenly the\nVery Young Man let go of the Big Business Man's arm and looked around to\nwhere the Doctor was still leaning pensively against the table leg. The\nBanker saw him speak swiftly to the Big Business Man, but in so small a\nvoice he could not catch the words. Then both little figures turned\ntowards the table, and the Banker saw the Very Young Man put his hands\nto his mouth and shout. And upward to him came the shrillest, tiniest\nlittle voice he had ever heard, yet a voice still embodying the\ncharacteristic intonation of the Very Young Man.\n\n\"Hey, Doctor!\" came the words. \"You'll never get here if you don't come\nnow.\"\n\nThe Doctor looked up abruptly; he evidently heard the words and realized\nhis situation. (He was by this time not more than an inch and a half in\nheight.) He hesitated only a moment, and then, as the other two little\nfigures waved their arms wildly, he began running towards them. For more\nthan a minute he ran. The Very Young Man started towards him, but the\nDoctor waved him back, redoubling his efforts.\n\nWhen he arrived at the edge of the handkerchief, evidently he was nearly\nwinded, for he stopped beside his friends, and stood breathing heavily.\nThe Banker leaned forwards, and could see the three little figures (they\nwere not as big as the joint of his little finger) talking earnestly;\nthe Very Young Man was gesticulating wildly, pointing towards the ring.\nOne of them made a start, but the others called him back.\n\nThen they began waving their arms, and all at once the Banker realized\nthey were waving at him. He leaned down, and by their motions knew that\nsomething was wrong--that they wanted him to do something.\n\nTrembling with fright, the Banker left his chair and knelt upon the\nfloor. The Very Young Man made a funnel of his hands and shouted up:\n\"It's too far away. We can't make it--we're too small!\"\n\nThe Banker looked his bewilderment. Then he thought suddenly of the\nspoon that he still held in his hand, and he put it down towards them.\nThe three little figures ducked and scattered as the spoon in the\nBanker's trembling fingers neared them.\n\n\"Not that--the ring. Bring it closer. Hurry--Hurry!\" shouted the Very\nYoung Man. The Banker, leaning closer, could just hear the words.\nComprehending at last, he picked up the ring and laid it near the edge\nof the handkerchief. Immediately the little figures ran over to it and\nbegan climbing up.\n\nThe Very Young Man was the first to reach it; the Banker could see him\nvault upwards and land astraddle upon its top. The Doctor was up in a\nmoment more, and the two were reaching down their hands to help up the\nBig Business Man. The Banker slid the spoon carefully along the floor\ntowards the ring, but the Big Business Man waved it away. The Banker\nlaid the spoon aside, and when he looked at the ring again the Big\nBusiness Man was up beside his companions, standing upright with them\nupon the top of the ring.\n\nThe Banker stared so long and intently, his vision blurred. He closed\nhis eyes for a moment, and when he opened them again the little figures\non the top of the ring had disappeared.\n\nThe Banker felt suddenly sick and faint in the closeness of the room.\nRising to his feet, he hurried to a window and threw up the sash. A gust\nof rain and wind beat against his face as he stood leaning on the sill.\nHe felt much better after a few moments; and remembering his friends, he\nclosed the window and turned back towards the ring. At first he thought\nhe could just make them out, but when he got down on the floor close\nbeside the ring, he saw nothing.\n\nAlmost unnerved, he sat down heavily upon the floor beside the\nhandkerchief, leaning on one elbow. A corner of the handkerchief was\nturned back, and one side was ruffled where the wind from the opened\nwindow had blown it up. He smoothed out the handkerchief carefully.\n\nFor some time the Banker sat quiet, reclining uncomfortably upon the\nhard floor. The room was very still--its silence oppressed him. He\nstared stolidly at the ring, his head in a turmoil. The ring looked\noddly out of place, lying over near one edge of the handkerchief; he had\nalways seen it in the center before. Abruptly he put out his hand and\npicked it up. Then remembrance of the Doctor's warning flooded over him.\nIn sudden panic he put the ring down again, almost in the same place at\nthe edge of the handkerchief.\n\nTrembling all over, he looked at his watch; it was a quarter to nine. He\nrose stiffly to his feet and sank into his chair. After a moment he\nlighted a cigar. The handkerchief lay at his feet; he could just see the\nring over the edge of his knees. For a long time he sat staring.\n\nThe striking of a church clock nearby roused him. He shook himself\ntogether and blinked at the empty room. In his hand he held an unlighted\ncigar; mechanically he raised it to his lips. The sound of the church\nbells died away; the silence of the room and the loneliness of it made\nhim shiver. He looked at his watch again. Ten o'clock! Still another\nhour to wait and watch, and then he could take the ring back to the\nMuseum. He glanced down at the ring; it was still lying by the edge of\nthe handkerchief.\n\nAgain the Banker fell into a stupor as he stared at the glistening gold\nband lying on the floor at his feet. How lonely he felt! Yet he was not\nalone, he told himself. His three friends were still there, hardly two\nfeet from the toe of his shoe. He wondered how they were making out.\nWould they come back any moment? Would they ever come back?\n\nAnd then the Banker found himself worrying because the ring was not in\nthe center of the handkerchief.\n\nHe felt frightened, and he wondered why. Again he looked at his watch.\nThey had been gone more than two hours now. Swiftly he stooped, and\nlifting the ring, gazed at it searchingly, holding it very close to his\neyes. Then he carefully put it down in the center of the handkerchief,\nand lay back in his chair with a long sigh of relief. It was all right\nnow; just a little while to wait, and then he could take it back to the\nMuseum. In a moment his eyes blinked, closed, and soon he was fast\nasleep, lying sprawled out in the big leather chair and breathing\nheavily.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nPERILOUS WAYS\n\n\nThe Very Young Man sat on the floor, between his two friends at the edge\nof the handkerchief, and put the first pellets of the drug to his\ntongue. His heart was beating furiously; his forehead was damp with the\nsweat of excitement and of fear. The pellets tasted sweet, and yet a\nlittle acrid. He crushed them in his mouth and swallowed them hastily.\n\nIn the silence of the room, the ticking of his watch suddenly sounded\nvery loud. He raised his arm and looked at its face; it was just ten\nminutes past eight. He continued to stare at its dial, wondering why\nnothing was happening to him. Then all at once the figures on the watch\nbecame very sharp and vivid; he could see them with microscopic\nclearness. A buzzing sounded in his ears.\n\nHe remembered having felt the same way just before he fainted. He drew a\ndeep breath and looked around the room; it swam before his gaze. He\nclosed his eyes and waited, wondering if he would faint. The buzzing in\nhis head grew louder; a feeling of nausea possessed him.\n\nAfter a moment his head cleared; he felt better. Then all at once he\nrealized that the floor upon which he sat was moving. It seemed to be\nshifting out from under him in all directions. He sat with his feet flat\nupon the floor, his knees drawn close against his chin. And the floor\nseemed to be carrying his feet farther out; he constantly had to be\npulling them back against him. He put one hand down beside him, and\ncould feel his fingers dragging very slowly as the polished surface\nmoved past. The noise in his head was almost gone now. He opened his\neyes.\n\nBefore him, across the handkerchief the Banker sat in his chair. He had\ngrown enormously in size, and as the Very Young Man looked he could see\nhim and the chair growing steadily larger. He met the Banker's anxious\nglance, and smiled up at him. Then he looked at his two friends, sitting\non the floor beside him. They alone, of everything within his range of\nvision, had grown no larger.\n\nThe Very Young Man thought of the belt around his waist. He put his hand\nto it, and found it tight as before. So, after all, they would not have\nto leave anything behind, he thought.\n\nThe Doctor rose to his feet and turned away, back under the huge table\nthat loomed up behind him. The Very Young Man got up, too, and stood\nbeside the Big Business Man, holding to him for support. His head felt\nstrangely confused; his legs were weak and shaky.\n\nSteadily larger grew the room and everything in it. The Very Young Man\nturned his eyes up to the light high overhead. Its great electric bulbs\ndazzled him with their brilliancy; its powerful glare made objects\naround as bright as though in daylight. After a moment the Big Business\nMan's grip on his arm tightened.\n\n\"God, it's weird!\" he said in a tense whisper. \"Look!\"\n\nBefore them spread a great, level, shining expanse of black, with the\nring in its center--a huge golden circle. Beyond the farther edge of the\nblack they could see the feet of the banker, and the lower part of his\nlegs stretching into the air far above them.\n\nThe Very Young Man looked up still higher, and saw the Banker staring\ndown at him, \"Good-by, my boy,\" said the Banker. His voice came from far\naway in a great roar to the Very Young Man's ears.\n\n\"Good-by, sir,\" said the Very Young Man, and waved his hand.\n\nSeveral minutes passed, and still the Very Young Man stood holding to\nhis companion, and watching the expanse of handkerchief widening out and\nthe gleaming ring growing larger. Then he thought of the Doctor, and\nturned suddenly to look behind him. Across the wide, glistening surface\nof the floor stood the Doctor, leaning against the tremendous column\nthat the Very Young Man knew was the leg of the center-table. And as the\nVery Young Man stood staring, he could see this distance between them\ngrowing steadily greater. A sudden fear possessed him, and he shouted to\nhis friend.\n\n\"Good Lord, suppose he can't make it!\" said the Big Business Man\nfearfully.\n\n\"He's coming,\" answered the Very Young Man. \"He's got to make it.\"\n\nThe Doctor was running towards them now, and in a few moments he was\nbeside them, breathing heavily.\n\n\"Close call, Frank,\" said the Big Business Man, shaking his head. \"You\nwere the one said we must keep together.\" The Doctor was too much out of\nbreath to answer.\n\n\"This is worse,\" said the Very Young Man. \"Look where the ring is.\"\n\nMore than two hundred yards away across the black expanse of silk\nhandkerchief lay the ring.\n\n\"It's almost as high as our waist now, and look how far it is!\" added\nthe Very Young Man excitedly.\n\n\"It's getting farther every minute,\" said the Big Business Man. \"Come\non,\" and he started to run towards the ring.\n\n\"I can't make it. It's too far!\" shouted the Doctor after him.\n\nThe Big Business Man stopped short. \"What'll we do?\" he asked. \"We've\ngot to get there.\"\n\n\"That ring will be a mile away in a few minutes, at the rate it's\ngoing,\" said the Very Young Man.\n\n\"We'll have to get him to move it over here,\" decided the Doctor,\nlooking up into the air, and pointing.\n\n\"Gee, I never thought of that!\" said the Very Young Man. \"Oh, great\nScott, look at him!\"\n\nOut across the broad expanse of handkerchief they could see the huge\nwhite face of their friend looming four or five hundred feet in the air\nabove them. It was the most astounding sight their eyes had ever beheld;\nyet so confused were they by the flood of new impressions to which they\nwere being subjected that this colossal figure added little to their\nsurprise.\n\n\"We must make him move the ring over here,\" repeated the Doctor.\n\n\"You'll never make him hear you,\" said the Big Business Man, as the Very\nYoung Man began shouting at the top of his voice.\n\n\"We've got to,\" said the Very Young Man breathlessly. \"Look at that\nring. We can't get to it now. We're stranded here. Good Lord! What's the\nmatter with him--can't he see us?\" he added, and began shouting again.\n\n\"He's getting up,\" said the Doctor. They could see the figure of the\nBanker towering in the air a thousand feet above the ring, and then with\na swoop of his enormous face come down to them as he knelt upon the\nfloor.\n\nWith his hands to his mouth, the Very Young Man shouted up: \"It's too\nfar away. We can't make it--we're too small.\" They waited. Suddenly,\nwithout warning, a great wooden oval bowl fifteen or twenty feet across\ncame at them with tremendous speed. They scattered hastily in terror.\n\n\"Not that--the ring!\" shouted the Very Young Man, as he realized it was\nthe spoon in the Banker's hand that had frightened them.\n\nA moment more and the ring was before them, lying at the edge of the\nhandkerchief--a circular pit of rough yellow rock breast high. They ran\nover to it and climbed upon its top.\n\nAnother minute and the ring had grown until its top became a narrow\ncurving path upon which they could stand. They got upon their feet and\nlooked around curiously.\n\n\"Well, we're here,\" remarked the Very Young Man. \"Everything's O.K. so\nfar. Let's get right around after that scratch.\"\n\n\"Keep together,\" cautioned the Doctor, and they started off along the\npath, following its inner edge.\n\nAs they progressed, the top of the ring steadily became broader; the\nsurface underfoot became rougher. The Big Business Man, walking nearest\nthe edge, pulled his companion towards him. \"Look there!\" he said. They\nstood cautiously at the edge and looked down.\n\nBeneath them the ring bulged out. Over the bulge they could see the\nblack of the handkerchief--a sheer hundred-feet drop. The ring curved\nsharply to the left; they could follow its wall all the way around; it\nformed a circular pit some two hundred and fifty feet in diameter.\n\nA gentle breeze fanned their faces as they walked. The Very Young Man\nlooked up into the gray of the distance overhead. A little behind, over\nhis shoulder he saw above him in the sky a great, gleaming light many\ntimes bigger than the sun. It cast on the ground before him an opaque\nshadow, blurred about the edges.\n\n\"Pretty good day, at that,\" remarked the Very Young Man, throwing out\nhis chest.\n\nThe Doctor laughed. \"It's half-past eight at night,\" he said. \"And if\nyou'll remember half an hour ago, it's a very stormy night, too.\"\n\nThe Big Business Man stopped short in his walk. \"Just think,\" he said\npointing up into the gray of the sky, with a note of awe in his voice,\n\"over there, not more than fifteen feet away, is a window, looking down\ntowards the Gaiety Theater and Broadway.\"\n\nThe Very Young. Man looked bewildered. \"That window's a hundred miles\naway,\" he said positively.\n\n\"Fifteen feet,\" said the Big Business Man. \"Just beyond the table.\"\n\n\"It's all in the viewpoint\" said the Doctor, and laughed again.\n\nThey had recovered their spirits by now, the Very Young Man especially\nseeming imbued with the enthusiasm of adventure.\n\nThe path became constantly rougher as they advanced.\n\nThe ground underfoot--a shaggy, yellow, metallic ore--was strewn now\nwith pebbles. These pebbles grew larger farther on, becoming huge rocks\nand bowlders that greatly impeded their progress.\n\nThey soon found it difficult to follow the brink of the precipice. The\npath had broadened now so that its other edge was out of sight, for they\ncould see only a short distance amid the bowlders that everywhere\ntumbled about, and after a time they found themselves wandering along,\nlost in the barren waste.\n\n\"How far is the scratch, do you suppose?\" the Very Young Man wanted to\nknow.\n\nThey stopped and consulted a moment; then the Very Young Man clambered\nup to the top of a rock. \"There's a range of hills over there pretty\nclose,\" he called down to them. \"That must be the way.\"\n\nThey had just started again in the direction of the hills when, almost\nwithout warning, and with a great whistle and roar, a gale of wind swept\ndown upon them. They stood still and looked at each other with startled\nfaces, bracing with their feet against its pressure.\n\n\"Oh, golly, what's this?\" cried the Very Young Man, and sat down\nsuddenly upon the ground to keep from being blown forward.\n\nThe wind increased rapidly in violence until, in a moment, all three of\nthe men were crouching upon the ground for shelter.\n\n\"Great Scott, this is a tornado!\" ejaculated the Big Business Man. His\nwords were almost lost amid the howling of the blast as it swept across\nthe barren waste of rocks.\n\n\"Rogers never told us anything about this. It's getting worse every\nminute. I----\" A shower of pebbles and a great cloud of metallic dust\nswept past, leaving them choking and gasping for breath.\n\nThe Very Young Man got upon his hands and knees.\n\n\"I'm going over there,\" he panted. \"It's better.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nSTRANGE EXPERIENCES\n\n\nLed by the Very Young Man, the three crawled a few yards to where a\ncluster of bowlders promised better shelter. Huddled behind this mass of\nrock, they found themselves protected in a measure from the violence of\nthe storm. Lying there, they could see yellowish-gray clouds of sand go\nsweeping by, with occasionally a hail of tiny pebbles, blowing almost\nhorizontal. Overhead, the sky was unchanged. Not a vestige of cloud was\nvisible, only the gray-blue of an immense distance, with the huge\ngleaming light, like an enormous sun, hung in its center.\n\nThe Very Young Man put his hand on the Doctor's arm. \"It's going down,\"\nhe said. Hardly were the words out of his mouth before, with even less\nwarning than it began, the gale abruptly ceased. There remained only the\npleasantly gentle breeze of a summer afternoon blowing against their\nfaces. And this came from almost an opposite direction to the storm.\n\nThe three men looked at one another in amazement.\n\n\"Well, I'll be----\" ejaculated the Very Young Man. \"What next?\"\n\nThey waited for some time, afraid to venture out from the rocks among\nwhich they had taken refuge. Then, deciding that the storm, however\nunexplainable, was over for the time at least, they climbed to their\nfeet and resumed their journey with bruised knees, but otherwise none\nthe worse for the danger through which they had passed.\n\nAfter walking a short distance, they came up a little incline, and\nbefore them, hardly more than a quarter of a mile away, they could see a\nrange of hills.\n\n\"The scratch must be behind those hills,\" said the Very Young Man,\npointing.\n\n\"It's a long distance,\" said the Big Business Man thoughtfully. \"We're\nstill growing smaller--look.\"\n\nTheir minds had been so occupied that for some time they had forgotten\nthe effect of the drug upon their stature. As they looked about them now\nthey could see the rocks around them still increasing steadily in size,\nand could feel the ground shifting under their feet when they stood\nstill.\n\n\"You're right; we're getting smaller,\" observed the Very Young Man. \"How\nlong before we'll stop, do you suppose?\"\n\nThe Doctor drew the Chemist's memoranda from the pouch of his belt. \"It\nsays about five or six hours for the first four pellets,\" he read.\n\nThe Very Young Man looked at his watch. \"Quarter to nine. We've been\nless than an hour yet. Come on, let's keep going,\" and he started\nwalking rapidly forward.\n\nThey walked for a time in silence. The line of hills before them grew\nvisibly in size, and they seemed slowly to be nearing it.\n\n\"I've been thinking,\" began the Doctor thoughtfully as he glanced up at\nthe hills. \"There's one theory of Rogers's that was a fallacy. You\nremember he was quite positive that this change of stature became\nsteadily more rapid, until it reached its maximum rate and then remained\nconstant. If that were so we should probably be diminishing in size more\nrapidly now than when we first climbed on to the ring. If we had so much\ntrouble getting to the ring then\"--he smiled at the remembrance of their\ndifficulty--\"I don't see how we could ever get to those hills now.\"\n\n\"Gee, that's so,\" said the Very Young Man. \"We'd never be able to get\nanywhere, would we?\"\n\n\"How do you figure it works?\" asked the Big Business Man.\n\nThe Doctor folded up the paper and replaced it in his belt. \"I don't\nknow,\" he answered. \"I think probably it proceeds in cycles, like the\nnormal rate of growth--times of rapid progress succeeded by periods of\ncomparative inactivity.\"\n\n\"I never knew people grew that way,\" observed the Very Young Man.\n\n\"They do,\" said the Doctor. \"And if these drugs produce the same effect\nwe----\" He got no further, for suddenly the earth seemed to rise swiftly\nunder them, and they were thrown violently to the ground.\n\nThe Very Young Man, as he lay prone, looked upward, and saw the sunlike\nlight above fall swiftly down across the sky and disappear below the\nhorizon, plunging the world about them into the gloom of a\nsemi-twilight. A wind, fiercer than before, swept over them with a roar.\n\n\"The end of the world,\" murmured the Very Young Man to himself. And he\nwondered why he was not frightened.\n\nThen came the feeling of an extraordinary lightness of body, as though\nthe ground were dropping away from under him. The wind abruptly ceased\nblowing. He saw the ball of light rise swiftly from the horizon and\nmount upward in a great, gleaming arc to the zenith, where again it hung\nmotionless.\n\nThe three men lay quiet, their heads reeling. Then the Very Young Man\nsat up dizzily and began feeling himself all over. \"There's nothing\nwrong with me,\" he said lugubriously, meeting the eyes of his friends\nwho apparently were also more surprised than hurt. \"But--oh, my gosh,\nthe whole universe went nutty!\" he added to himself in awe.\n\n\"What did that?\" asked the Big Business Man. He climbed unsteadily to\nhis feet and sat upon a rock, holding his head in his hands.\n\nThe Doctor was up in a moment beside him. \"We're not hurt,\" he said,\nlooking at his companions. \"Don't let's waste any more time--let's get\ninto that valley.\" The Very Young Man could see by his manner that he\nknew or guessed what had happened.\n\n\"But say; what----\" began the Very Young Man.\n\n\"Come on,\" interrupted the Doctor, and started walking ahead swiftly.\n\nThere was nothing for his two friends to do but to follow. They walked\nin silence, in single file, picking their way among the rocks. For a\nquarter of an hour or more they kept going, until finally they came to\nthe ridge of hills, finding them enormous rocks, several hundred feet\nhigh, strewn closely together.\n\n\"The valley must be right beyond,\" said the Doctor. \"Come on.\"\n\nThe spaces between these huge rocks were, some of them, fifty feet or\nmore in width. Inside the hills the travelers found the ground even\nrougher than before, and it was nearly half an hour before they emerged\non the other side.\n\nInstead of the shallow valley they expected to find, they came upon a\nprecipice--a sheer drop into a tremendous ca\u00f1on, half as wide possibly\nas it was deep. They could see down to its bottom from where they\nstood--the same rocky, barren waste as that through which they had been\ntraveling. Across the ca\u00f1on, on the farther side, lay another line of\nhills.\n\n\"It's the scratch all right,\" said the Very Young Man, as they stopped\nnear the brink of the precipice, \"but, holy smoke! Isn't it big?\"\n\n\"That's two thousand feet down there,\" said the Big Business Man,\nstepping cautiously nearer to the edge. \"Rogers didn't say it was so\ndeep.\"\n\n\"That's because we've been so much longer getting here,\" explained the\nDoctor.\n\n\"How are we going to get down?\" asked the Very Young Man as he stood\nbeside the Big Business Man within a few feet of the brink. \"It's\ngetting deeper every minute, don't forget that.\"\n\nThe Big Business Man knelt down and carefully approached to the very\nedge of the precipice. Then, as he looked over, he got upon his feet\nwith a laugh of relief. \"Come here,\" he said.\n\nThey joined him at the edge and, looking over, could see that the jagged\nroughness of the wall made the descent, though difficult, not\nexceptionally hazardous. Below them, not more than twenty feet, a wide\nledge jutted out, and beyond that they could see other similar ledges\nand crevices that would afford a foothold.\n\n\"We can get down that,\" said the Very Young Man. \"There's an easy\nplace,\" and he pointed farther along the brink, to where a break in the\nedge seemed to offer a means of descent to the ledge just below.\n\n\"It's going to be a mighty long climb down,\" said the Big Business Man.\n\"Especially as we're getting smaller all the time. I wonder,\" he added\nthoughtfully, \"how would it be if we made ourselves larger before we\nstarted. We could get big enough, you know, so that it would only be a\nfew hundred feet down there. Then, after we got down, we could get small\nagain.\"\n\n\"That's a thought,\" said the Very Young Man.\n\nThe Doctor sat down somewhat wearily, and again took the papers from his\nbelt. \"The idea is a good one,\" he said. \"But there's one thing you\noverlook. The larger we get, the smoother the wall is going to be. Look,\ncan't you see it changing every moment?\"\n\nIt was true. Even in the short time since they had first looked down,\nnew crevices had opened up. The descent, though longer, was momentarily\nbecoming less dangerous.\n\n\"You see,\" continued the Doctor, \"if the valley were only a few hundred\nfeet deep, the precipice might then be so sheer we could not trust\nourselves to it at all.\"\n\n\"You're right,\" observed the Big Business Man.\n\n\"Well, it's not very hard to get down now,\" said the Very Young Man.\n\"Let's get going before it gets any deeper. Say,\" he added, \"how about\nstopping our size where it is? How would that work?\"\n\nThe Doctor was reading the papers he held in his hand. \"I think,\" he\nsaid, \"it would be our wisest course to follow as closely as possible\nwhat Rogers tells us to do. It may be harder, but I think we will avoid\ntrouble in the end.\"\n\n\"We could get lost in size just as easily as in space, couldn't we?\" the\nBig Business Man put in. \"That's a curious idea, isn't it?\"\n\n\"It's true,\" agreed the Doctor. \"It is something we must guard against\nvery carefully.\"\n\n\"Well, come on then, let's get going,\" said the Very Young Man, pulling\nthe Doctor to his feet.\n\nThe Big Business Man glanced at his watch. \"Twenty to ten,\" he said.\nThen he looked up into the sky. \"One hour and a half ago,\" he added\nsentimentally, \"we were up there. What will another hour bring--I\nwonder?\"\n\n\"Nothing at all,\" said the Very Young Man, \"if we don't ever get\nstarted. Come on.\"\n\nHe walked towards the place he had selected, followed by his companions.\nAnd thus the three adventurers began their descent into the ring.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nTHE VALLEY OF THE SACRIFICE\n\n\nFor the first half-hour of their climb down into the valley of the\nscratch, the three friends were too preoccupied with their own safety to\ntalk more than an occasional sentence. They came upon many places that\nat first glance appeared impassable, or at least sufficiently hazardous\nto cause them to hesitate, but in each instance the changing contour of\nthe precipice offered some other means of descent.\n\nAfter thirty minutes of arduous effort, the Big Business Man sat down\nsuddenly upon a rock and began to unlace his shoes.\n\n\"I've got to rest a while,\" he groaned. \"My feet are in terrible shape.\"\n\nHis two companions were glad of the opportunity to sit with him for a\nmoment.\n\n\"Gosh, I'm all in, too!\" said the Very Young Man with a sigh.\n\nThey were sitting upon a ledge about twenty feet wide, with the wall\ndown which they had come at their back.\n\n\"I'll swear that's as far down there as it ever was,\" said the Big\nBusiness Man, with a wave of his hand towards the valley below them.\n\n\"Further,\" remarked the Very Young Man. \"I've known that right along.\"\n\n\"That's to be expected,\" said the Doctor. \"But we're a third the way\ndown, just the same; that's the main thing.\" He glanced up the rocky,\nprecipitous wall behind them. \"We've come down a thousand feet, at\nleast. The valley must be three thousand feet deep or more now.\"\n\n\"Say, how deep does it get before it stops?\" inquired the Very Young\nMan.\n\nThe Doctor smiled at him quietly. \"Rogers's note put it about twelve\nthousand,\" he answered. \"It should reach that depth and stop about\"--he\nhesitated a moment, calculating--\"about two o'clock,\" he finished.\n\n\"Some climb,\" commented the Very Young Man. \"We could do this a lot\nbetter than we're doing it, I think.\"\n\nFor some time they sat in silence. From where they sat the valley had\nall the appearance of a rocky, barren ca\u00f1on of their own world above, as\nit might have looked on the late afternoon of a cloudless summer day. A\ngentle breeze was blowing, and in the sky overhead they could still see\nthe huge light that for them was the sun.\n\n\"The weather is certainly great down here anyway,\" observed the Very\nYoung Man, \"that's one consolation.\"\n\nThe Big Business Man had replaced his shoes, taken a swallow of water,\nand risen to his feet, preparing to start downward again, when suddenly\nthey all noticed a curious swaying motion, as though the earth were\nmoving under them.\n\n\"Now what?\" ejaculated the Very Young Man, standing up abruptly, with\nhis feet spread wide apart.\n\nThe ground seemed pressing against his feet as if he were weighted down\nwith a heavy load. And he felt a little also as though in a moving train\nwith a side thrust to guard against. The sun was no longer visible, and\nthe valley was plunged in the semidarkness of twilight. A strong wind\nsprang up, sweeping down upon them from above.\n\nThe Very Young Man and the Big Business Man looked puzzled; the Doctor\nalone of the three seemed to understand what was happening.\n\n\"He's moving the ring,\" he explained, with a note of apprehension in his\nvoice.\n\n\"Oh,\" ejaculated the Big Business Man, comprehending at last, \"so that's\nthe----\"\n\nThe Very Young Man standing with his back to the wall and his legs\nspread wide looked hastily at his watch. \"Moving the ring? Why, damn\nit----\" he began impetuously.\n\nThe Big Business Man interrupted him. \"Look there, look!\" he almost\nwhispered, awestruck.\n\nThe sky above the valley suddenly had become suffused with red. As they\nwatched it seemed to take form, appearing no longer space, but filled\nwith some enormous body of reddish color. In one place they could see it\nbroken into a line of gray, and underneath the gray, two circular holes\nof light gleamed down at them.\n\nThe Doctor shuddered and closed his eyes; his two friends stared upward,\nfascinated into immobility.\n\n\"What--is--that?\" the Very Young Man whispered.\n\nBefore he could be answered, the earth swayed under them more violently\nthan before. The red faded back out of the sky, and the sun appeared\nsweeping up into the zenith, where it hung swaying a moment and then\npoised motionless. The valley was flooded again with light; the ground\nsteadied under them and became quiet. The wind died rapidly away, and in\nanother moment it was as though nothing unusual had occurred.\n\nFor a time the three friends stood silent, too astonished for words at\nthis extraordinary experience. The Doctor was the first to recover\nhimself. \"He moved the ring,\" he said hurriedly. \"That's twice. We must\nhurry.\"\n\n\"It's only quarter past ten. We told him not till eleven,\" protested the\nVery Young Man.\n\n\"Even that is too soon for safety,\" said the Doctor back over his\nshoulder, for already he had started downward.\n\nIt was nearly twelve o'clock when they stopped again for rest. At this\ntime the valley appeared about seven or eight thousand feet deep: they\nestimated themselves to be slightly more than half-way down. From eleven\nuntil twelve they had momentarily expected some disturbing phenomena\nattendant upon the removal of the ring by the Banker from the clubroom\nto its place in the Museum. But nothing unusual had occurred.\n\n\"He probably decided to leave it alone for a while,\" commented the Big\nBusiness Man, as they were discussing the matter. \"Glad he showed that\nmuch sense.\"\n\n\"It would not bother us much now,\" the Doctor replied. \"We're too far\ndown. See how the light is changing.\"\n\nThe sky showed now only as a narrow ribbon of blue between the edges of\nthe ca\u00f1on's walls. The sun was behind the wall down which they were\nclimbing, out of sight, and throwing their side of the valley into\nshadow. And already they could begin to see a dim phosphorescence\nglowing from the rocks near at hand.\n\nThe Very Young Man, sitting beside the Doctor, suddenly gripped his\nfriend by the arm. \"A bird,\" he said, pointing down the valley. \"See it\nthere?\"\n\nFrom far off they could see a bird coming up the center of the valley at\na height apparently almost level with their own position, and flying\ntowards them. They watched it in silence as it rapidly approached.\n\n\"Great Scott, it's big!\" muttered the Big Business Man in an undertone.\n\nAs the bird came closer they saw it was fully fifty feet across the\nwings. It was flying straight down the valley at tremendous speed. When\nit was nearly opposite them they heard a familiar \"cheep, cheep,\" come\nechoing across the valley.\n\n\"The sparrow,\" whispered the Very Young Man. \"Oh, my gosh, look how big\nit is!\"\n\nIn another moment it had passed them; they watched in silence until it\ndisappeared in the distance.\n\n\"Well,\" said the Very Young Man, \"if that had ever seen us----\" He drew\na long breath, leaving the rest to the imagination of his hearers.\n\n\"What a wonderful thing!\" said the Big Business Man, with a note of awe\nin his voice. \"Just think--that sparrow when we last saw it was\ninfinitesimally small.\"\n\nThe Doctor laughed. \"It's far smaller now than it was then,\" he said.\n\"Only since we last saw it we have changed size to a much greater extent\nthan it has.\"\n\n\"Foolish of us to have sent it in here,\" remarked the Big Business Man\ncasually. \"Suppose that----\" He stopped abruptly.\n\nThe Very Young Man started hastily to his feet.\n\n\"Oh, golly!\" he exclaimed as the same thought occurred to him. \"That\nlizard----\" He looked about him wildly.\n\n\"It was foolish perhaps.\" The Doctor spoke quietly. \"But we can't help\nit now. The sparrow has gone. That lizard may be right here at our\nfeet\"--The Very Young Man jumped involuntarily--\"and so small we can't\nsee it,\" the Doctor finished with a smile. \"Or it may be a hundred miles\naway and big as a dinosaur.\" The Very Young Man shuddered.\n\n\"It was senseless of us to let them get in here anyway,\" said the Big\nBusiness Man. \"That sparrow evidently has stopped getting smaller. Do\nyou realize how big it will be to us, after we've diminished a few\nhundred more times?\"\n\n\"We needn't worry over it,\" said the Doctor. \"Even if we knew the lizard\ngot into the valley the chances of our seeing it here are one in a\nmillion. But we don't even know that. If you'll remember it was still\nsome distance away from the scratch when it became invisible; I doubt\nvery much if it even got there. No, I think probably we'll never see it\nagain.\"\n\n\"I hope not,\" declared the Very Young Man emphatically.\n\nFor another hour they climbed steadily downward, making more rapid\nprogress than before, for the descent became constantly less difficult.\nDuring this time they spoke little, but it was evident that the Very\nYoung Man, from the frequent glances he threw around, never for a moment\nforgot the possibility of encountering the lizard. The sparrow did not\nreturn, although for that, too, they were constantly on the look-out.\n\nIt was nearly half-past one when the Big Business Man threw himself upon\nthe ground exhausted. The valley at this time had reached a depth of\nover ten thousand feet. It was still growing deeper, but the travelers\nhad made good progress and were not more than fifteen hundred feet above\nits bottom.\n\nThey had been under tremendous physical exertion for over five hours,\ntoo absorbed in their strange experiences to think of eating, and now\nall three agreed it was foolish to attempt to travel farther without\nfood and rest.\n\n\"We had better wait here an hour or two,\" the Doctor decided. \"Our size\nwill soon remain constant and it won't take us long to get down after\nwe've rested.\"\n\n\"I'm hungry,\" suggested the Very Young Man, \"how about you?\"\n\nThey ate and drank sparingly of the little store they had brought with\nthem. The Doctor would not let them have much, both because he wanted to\nconserve their supply, and because he knew in their exhausted condition\nit would be bad for them to eat heartily.\n\nIt was about two o'clock when they noticed that objects around them no\nlonger were increasing in size. They had finished their meal and felt\ngreatly refreshed.\n\n\"Things have stopped growing,\" observed the Very Young Man. \"We've done\nfour pills' worth of the journey anyway,\" he added facetiously. He rose\nto his feet, stretching. He felt sore and bruised all over, but with the\nmeal and a little rest, not particularly tired.\n\n\"I move we go on down now,\" he suggested, walking to the edge of the\nhuge crevice in which they were sitting. \"It's only a couple of thousand\nfeet.\"\n\n\"Perhaps we might as well,\" agreed the Doctor, rising also. \"When we get\nto the floor of the valley, we can find a good spot and turn in for the\nnight.\"\n\nThe incongruity of his last words with the scene around made the Doctor\nsmile. Overhead the sky still showed a narrow ribbon of blue. Across the\nvalley the sunlight sparkled on the yellowish crags of the rocky wall.\nIn the shadow, on the side down which they were climbing, the rocks now\nshone distinctly phosphorescent, with a peculiar waviness of outline.\n\n\"Not much like either night or day, is it?\" added the Doctor. \"We'll\nhave to get used to that.\"\n\nThey started off again, and in another two hours found themselves going\ndown a gentle rocky slope and out upon the floor of the valley.\n\n\"We're here at last,\" said the Big Business Man wearily.\n\nThe Very Young Man looked up the great, jagged precipice down which they\nhad come, to where, far above, its edge against the strip of blue marked\nthe surface of the ring.\n\n\"Some trip,\" he remarked. \"I wouldn't want to tackle that every day.\"\n\n\"Four o'clock,\" said the Doctor, \"the light up there looks just the\nsame. I wonder what's happened to George.\"\n\nNeither of his companions answered him. The Big Business Man lay\nstretched full length upon the ground near by, and the Very Young Man\nstill stood looking up the precipice, lost in thought.\n\n\"What a nice climb going back,\" he suddenly remarked.\n\nThe Doctor laughed. \"Don't let's worry about that, Jack. If you remember\nhow Rogers described it, getting back is easier than getting in. But the\nmain point now,\" he added seriously, \"is for us to make sure of getting\ndown to Arite as speedily as possible.\"\n\nThe Very Young Man surveyed the barren waste around them in dismay. The\nfloor of the valley was strewn with even larger rocks and bowlders than\nthose on the surface above, and looked utterly pathless and desolate.\n\"What do we do first?\" he asked dubiously.\n\n\"First,\" said the Doctor, smiling at the Big Business Man, who lay upon\nhis back staring up into the sky and paying no attention to them\nwhatever, \"I think first we had better settle ourselves for a good long\nrest here.\"\n\n\"If we stop at all, let's sleep a while,\" said the Very Young Man. \"A\nlittle rest only gets you stiff. It's a pretty exposed place out here\nthough, isn't it, to sleep?\" he added, thinking of the sparrow and the\nlizard.\n\n\"One of us will stay awake and watch,\" answered the Doctor.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nTHE PIT OF DARKNESS\n\n\nAt the suggestion of the Very Young Man they located without much\ndifficulty a sort of cave amid the rocks, which offered shelter for\ntheir rest. Taking turns watching, they passed eight hours in fair\ncomfort, and by noon next day, after another frugal meal they felt\nthoroughly refreshed and eager to continue the journey.\n\n\"We sure are doing this classy,\" observed the Very Young Man. \"Think of\nRogers--all he could do was fall asleep when he couldn't stay awake any\nmore. Gosh, what chances he took!\"\n\n\"We're playing it safe,\" agreed the Big Business Man.\n\n\"But we mustn't take it too easy,\" added the Doctor.\n\nThe Very Young Man stretched himself luxuriously and buckled his belt on\ntighter. \"Well, I'm ready for anything,\" he announced. \"What's next?\"\n\nThe Doctor consulted his papers. \"We find the circular pit Rogers made\nin the scratch and we descend into it. We take twelve more pills at the\nedge of the pit,\" he said.\n\nThe Very Young Man leaped to the top of a rock and looked out over the\ndesolate waste helplessly. \"How are we going to find the pit?\" he asked\ndubiously. \"It's not in sight, that's sure.\"\n\n\"It's down there--about five miles,\" said the Doctor. \"I saw it\nyesterday as we came down.\"\n\n\"That's easy,\" said the Very Young Man, and he started off\nenthusiastically, followed by the others.\n\nIn less than two hours they found themselves at the edge of the pit. It\nappeared almost circular in form, apparently about five miles across,\nand its smooth, shining walls extended almost perpendicularly down into\nblackness. Somewhat awed by the task confronting them in getting down\ninto this abyss, the three friends sat down near its brink to discuss\ntheir plan of action.\n\n\"We take twelve pills here,\" said the Doctor. \"That ought to make us\nsmall enough to climb down into that.\"\n\n\"Do you think we need so many?\" asked the Big Business Man thoughtfully.\n\"You know, Frank, we're making an awful lot of work for ourselves,\nplaying this thing so absolutely safe. Think of what a distance down\nthat will be after we have got as small as twelve pills will make us. It\nmight take us days to get to the bottom.\"\n\n\"How did Rogers get down?\" the Very Young Man wanted to know.\n\n\"He took the twelve pills here,\" the Doctor answered.\n\n\"But as I understand it, he fell most of the way down while he was still\nbig, and then got small afterwards at the bottom.\" This from the Big\nBusiness Man.\n\n\"I don't know how about you,\" said the Very Young Man drily, \"but I'd\nmuch rather take three days to walk down than fall down in one day.\"\n\nThe Doctor smiled. \"I still think,\" he said, \"that we had better stick\nto the directions Rogers left us. Then at least there is no danger of\nour getting lost in size. But I agree with you, Jack. I'd rather not\nfall down, even if it takes longer to walk.\"\n\n\"I wonder----\" began the Big Business Man. \"You know I've been\nthinking--it does seem an awful waste of energy for us to let ourselves\nget smaller than absolutely necessary in climbing down these places.\nMaybe you don't realize it.\"\n\n\"I do,\" said the Very Young Man, looking sorrowfully at the ragged shoes\non his feet and the cuts and bruises on his legs.\n\n\"What I mean is----\" persisted the Big Business Man.\n\n\"How far do you suppose we have actually traveled since we started last\nnight?\"\n\n\"That's pretty hard to estimate,\" said the doctor. \"We have walked\nperhaps fifteen miles altogether, besides the climb down. I suppose we\nactually came down five or six thousand feet.\"\n\n\"And at the size we are now it would have been twelve thousand feet\ndown, wouldn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered the Doctor, \"it would.\"\n\n\"And just think,\" went on the Big Business Man, \"right now, based on the\nsize we were when we began, we've only gone some six feet altogether\nfrom the place we started.\"\n\n\"And a sixteenth of an inch or less since we left the surface of the\nring,\" said the Doctor smiling.\n\n\"Gee, that's a weird thought,\" the Very Young Man said, as he gazed in\nawe at the lofty heights about them.\n\n\"I've been thinking,\" continued the Big Business Man. \"You say we must\nbe careful not to get lost in size. Well, suppose instead of taking\ntwelve pills here, we only take six. That should be enough to get us\nstarted--possibly enough to get us all the way down. Then before we\nmoved at all we could take the other six. That would keep it straight,\nwouldn't it?\"\n\n\"Great idea,\" said the Very Young Man. \"I'm in favor of that.\"\n\n\"It sounds feasible--certainly if we can get all the way down with six\npills we will save a lot of climbing.\"\n\n\"If six aren't enough, we can easily take more,\" added the Big Business\nMan.\n\nAnd so they decided to take only six pills of the drug and to get down\nto the bottom of the pit, if possible, without taking more. The pit, as\nthey stood looking down into it now, seemed quite impossible of descent,\nfor its almost perpendicular wall was smooth and shining as polished\nbrass.\n\nThey took the drug, standing close together at the edge of the pit.\nImmediately began again the same crawling sensation underfoot, much more\nrapid this time, while all around them the rocks began very rapidly\nincreasing in size.\n\nThe pit now seemed widening out at an astounding rate. In a few minutes\nit had broadened so that its opposite side could not be seen. The wall\nat the brink of which they stood had before curved in a great sweeping\narc to enclose the circular hole; now it stretched in a nearly straight,\nunbroken line to the right and left as far as they could see. Beneath\nthem lay only blackness; it was as though they were at the edge of the\nworld.\n\n\"Good God, what a place to go down into,\" gasped the Big Business Man,\nafter they had been standing nearly half an hour in silence, appalled at\nthe tremendous changes taking place around them.\n\nFor some time past the wall before them had become sufficiently indented\nand broken to make possible their descent. It was the Doctor who first\nrealized the time--or perhaps it should be said, the size--they were\nlosing by their inactivity; and when with a few crisp words he brought\nthem to themselves, they immediately started downward.\n\nFor another six hours they traveled downward steadily, stopping only\nonce to eat. The descent during this time was not unlike that down the\nside of the valley, although towards the last it began rapidly to grow\nless precipitous.\n\nThey now found themselves confronted frequently with gentle slopes\ndownward, half a mile or more in extent, and sometimes by almost level\nplaces, succeeded by another sharp descent.\n\nDuring this part of the trip they made more rapid progress than at any\ntime since starting, the Very Young Man in his enthusiasm at times\nrunning forward and then sitting down to wait for the others to overtake\nhim.\n\nThe light overhead gradually faded into the characteristic luminous\nblackness the Chemist had described. As it did so, the phosphorescent\nquality of the rocks greatly increased, or at least became more\nnoticeable, so that the light illuminating the landscape became hardly\nless in volume, although totally different in quality.\n\nThe ground underfoot and the rocks themselves had been steadily\nchanging. They had lost now almost entirely the yellowishness, metal\nlook, and seemed to have more the quality of a gray opaque glass, or\nmarble. They appeared rather smoother, too, than before, although the\nhuge bowlders and loosely strewn rocks and pebbles still remained the\ncharacteristic feature of the landscape.\n\nThe three men were still diminishing in size; in fact, at this time the\nlast dose of the drug seemed to have attained its maximum power, for\nobjects around them appeared to be growing larger at a dizzying rate.\nThey were getting used to this effect, however, to a great extent, and\nwere no longer confused by the change as they had been before.\n\nIt was the Big Business Man who first showed signs of weakening, and at\nthe end of six hours or more of steady--and, towards the end, extremely\nrapid--traveling he finally threw himself down and declared he could go\nno farther. At this point they rested again several hours, taking turns\nat watch, and each of them getting some measure of sleep. Of the three,\nthe Very Young Man appeared in the best condition, although possibly it\nwas his enthusiasm that kept him from admitting even to himself any\nserious physical distress.\n\nIt was perhaps ten or twelve hours after they had taken the six pills\nthat they were again ready to start downward. Before starting the three\nadventurers discussed earnestly the advisability of taking the other six\npills. The action of the drug had ceased some time before. They decided\nnot to, since apparently there was no difficulty facing them at this\npart of the journey, and decreasing their stature would only\nimmeasurably lengthen the distance they had to go.\n\nThey had been traveling downward, through a barren land that now showed\nlittle change of aspect, for hardly more than another hour, when\nsuddenly, without warning, they came upon the tremendous glossy incline\nthat they had been expecting to reach for some time. The rocks and\nbowlders stopped abruptly, and they found at their feet, sloping\ndownward at an angle of nearly forty-five degrees, a great, smooth\nplane. It extended as far as they could see both to the right and left\nand downward, at a slightly lessening angle, into the luminous darkness\nthat now bounded their entire range of vision in every direction.\n\nThis plane seemed distinctly of a different substance than anything they\nhad hitherto encountered. It was, as the Chemist had described it,\napparently like a smooth black marble. Yet it was not so smooth to them\nnow as he had pictured it, for its surface was sufficiently indented and\nridged to afford foothold.\n\nThey started down this plane gingerly, yet with an assumed boldness they\nwere all of them far from feeling. It was slow work at first, and\noccasionally one or the other of them would slide headlong a score of\nfeet, until a break in the smoothness brought him to a stop. Their\nrubber-soled shoes stood them in good stead here, for without the aid\ngiven by them this part of the journey would have been impossible.\n\nFor several hours they continued this form of descent. The incline grew\nconstantly less steep, until finally they were able to walk down it\nquite comfortably. They stopped again to eat, and after traveling what\nseemed to them some fifteen miles from the top of the incline they\nfinally reached its bottom.\n\nThey seemed now to be upon a level floor--a ground of somewhat metallic\nquality such as they had become familiar with above. Only now there were\nno rocks or bowlders, and the ground was smoother and with a peculiar\ncorrugation. On one side lay the incline down which they had come. There\nwas nothing but darkness to be seen in any other direction. Here they\nstopped again to rest and recuperate, and then they discussed earnestly\ntheir next movements.\n\nThe Doctor, seated wearily upon the ground, consulted his memoranda\nearnestly. The Very Young Man sat close beside him. As usual the Big\nBusiness Man lay prone upon his back nearby, waiting for their decision.\n\n\"Rogers wasn't far from a forest when he got here,\" said the Very Young\nMan, looking sidewise at the papers in the Doctor's hand. \"And he speaks\nof a tiny range of hills; but we can't see anything from here.\"\n\n\"We may not be within many miles of where Rogers landed,\" answered the\nDoctor.\n\n\"No reason why we should be, at that, is there? Do you think we'll ever\nfind Arite?\"\n\n\"Don't overlook the fact we've got six more pills to take here,\" called\nthe Big Business Man.\n\n\"That's just what I was considering,\" said the Doctor thoughtfully.\n\"There's no use our doing anything until we have attained the right\nsize. Those hills and the forest and river we are looking for might be\nhere right at our feet and we couldn't see them while we are as big as\nthis.\"\n\n\"We'd better take the pills and stay right here until their action wears\noff. I'm going to take a sleep,\" said the Big Business Man.\n\n\"I think we might as well all sleep,\" said the Doctor. \"There could not\npossibly be anything here to harm us.\"\n\nThey each took the six additional pills without further words.\nPhysically exhausted as they were, and with the artificial drowsiness\nproduced by the drug, they were all three in a few moments fast asleep.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nTHE WELCOME OF THE MASTER\n\n\nIt was nearly twelve hours later, as their watches showed them, that the\nfirst of the weary adventurers awoke. The Very Young Man it was who\nfirst opened his eyes with a confused sense of feeling that he was in\nbed at home, and that this was the momentous day he was to start his\njourney into the ring. He sat up and rubbed his eyes vigorously to see\nmore clearly his surroundings.\n\nBeside him lay his two friends, fast asleep. With returning\nconsciousness came the memory of the events of the day and night before.\nThe Very Young Man sprang to his feet and vigorously awoke his\ncompanions.\n\nThe action of the drug again had ceased, and at first glance the scene\nseemed to have changed very little. The incline now was some distance\naway, although still visible, stretching up in a great arc and fading\naway into the blackness above. The ground beneath their feet still of\nits metallic quality, appeared far rougher than before. The Very Young\nMan bent down and put his hand upon it. There was some form of\nvegetation there, and, leaning closer, he could see what appeared to be\nthe ruins of a tiny forest, bent and trampled, the tree-trunks no larger\nthan slender twigs that he could have snapped asunder easily between his\nfingers.\n\n\"Look at this,\" he exclaimed. \"The woods--we're here.\"\n\nThe others knelt down with him.\n\n\"Be careful,\" cautioned the Doctor. \"Don't move around. We must get\nsmaller.\" He drew the papers from his pocket.\n\n\"Rogers was in doubt about this quantity to take,\" he added. \"We should\nbe now somewhere at the edge or in the forest he mentions. Yet we may be\nvery far from the point at which he reached the bottom of that incline.\nI think, too, that we are somewhat larger than he was. Probably the\nstrength of our drug differs from his to some extent.\"\n\n\"How much should we take next, I wonder?\" said the Big Business Man as\nhe looked at his companions.\n\nThe Doctor took a pill and crushed it in his hand. \"Let us take so\nmuch,\" he said, indicating a small portion of the powder. The others\neach crushed one of the pills and endeavored to take as nearly as\npossible an equal amount.\n\n\"I'm hungry,\" said the Very Young Man. \"Can we eat right after the\npowder?\"\n\n\"I don't think that should make any difference,\" the Doctor answered,\nand so accustomed to the drug were they now that, quite nonchalantly,\nthey sat down and ate.\n\nAfter a few moments it became evident that in spite of their care the\namounts of the drug they had taken were far from equal.\n\nBefore they had half finished eating, the Very Young Man was hardly more\nthan a third the size of the Doctor, with the Big Business Man about\nhalf-way between. This predicament suddenly struck them as funny, and\nall three laughed heartily at the effect of the drug.\n\n\"Hey, you, hurry up, or you'll never catch me,\" shouted the Very Young\nMan gleefully. \"Gosh, but you're big!\" He reached up and tried to touch\nthe Doctor's shoulder. Then, seeing the huge piece of chocolate in his\nfriend's hand and comparing it with the little one in his own, he added:\n\"Trade you chocolate. That's a regular meal you got there.\"\n\n\"That's a real idea,\" said the Big Business Man, ceasing his laughter\nabruptly. \"Do you know, if we ever get really low on food, all we have\nto do is one of us stay big and his food would last the other two a\nmonth.\"\n\n\"Fine; but how about the big one?\" asked the Very Young Man, grinning.\n\"He'd starve to death on that plan, wouldn't he?\"\n\n\"Well, then he could get much smaller than the other two, and they could\nfeed him. It's rather involved, I'll admit, but you know what I mean,\"\nthe Big Business Man finished somewhat lamely.\n\n\"I've got a much better scheme than that,\" said the Very Young Man. \"You\nlet the food stay large and you get small. How about that?\" he added\ntriumphantly. Then he laid carefully on the ground beside him a bit of\nchocolate and a few of the hard crackers they were eating. \"Stay there,\nlittle friends, when you grow up, I'll take you back,\" he added in a\ngleeful tone of voice.\n\n\"Strange that should never have occurred to us,\" said the Doctor. \"It's\na perfect way of replenishing our food supply,\" and quite seriously both\nhe and the Big Business Man laid aside some of their food.\n\n\"Thank me for that brilliant idea,\" said the Very Young Man. Then, as\nanother thought occurred to him, he scratched his head lugubriously.\n\"Wouldn't work very well if we were getting bigger, would it? Don't\nlet's ever get separated from any food coming out.\"\n\nThe Doctor was gigantic now in proportion to the other two, and both he\nand the Big Business Man took a very small quantity more of the drug in\nan effort to equalize their rate of bodily reduction. They evidently hit\nit about right, for no further change in their relative size occurred.\n\nAll this time the vegetation underneath them had been growing steadily\nlarger. From tiny broken twigs it grew to sticks bigger than their\nfingers, then to the thickness of their arms. They moved slightly from\ntime to time, letting it spread out from under them, or brushing it\naside and clearing a space in which they could sit more comfortably.\nStill larger it grew until the tree-trunks, thick now almost as their\nbodies, were lying broken and twisted, all about them. Over to one side\nthey could see, half a mile away, a place where the trees were still\nstanding--slender saplings, they seemed, growing densely together.\n\nIn half an hour more the Very Young Man announced he had stopped getting\nsmaller. The action of the drug ceased in the others a few minutes\nlater. They were still not quite in their relative sizes, but a few\ngrains of the powder quickly adjusted that.\n\nThey now found themselves near the edge of what once was a great forest.\nHuge trees, whose trunks measured six feet or more in diameter, lay\nscattered about upon the ground; not a single one was left standing. In\nthe distance they could see, some miles away, where the untrodden forest\nbegan.\n\nThey had replaced the food in their belts some time before, and now\nagain they were ready to start. Suddenly the Very Young Man spied a\nhuge, round, whitish-brown object lying beside a tree-trunk near by. He\nwent over and stood beside it. Then he called his friends excitedly. It\nwas irregularly spherical in shape and stood higher than his knees--a\ngreat jagged ball. The Very Young Man bent down, broke off a piece of\nthe ball, and, stuffing it into his mouth, began chewing with\nenthusiasm.\n\n\"Now, what do you think of that?\" he remarked with a grin. \"A cracker\ncrumb I must have dropped when we first began lunch!\"\n\nThey decided now to make for the nearest part of the unbroken forest. It\nwas two hours before they reached it, for among the tangled mass of\nbroken, fallen trees their progress was extremely difficult and slow.\nOnce inside, among the standing trees, they felt more lost than ever.\nThey had followed implicitly the Chemist's directions, and in general\nhad encountered the sort of country they expected. Nevertheless, they\nall three realized that it was probable the route they had followed\ncoming in was quite different from that taken by the Chemist; and in\nwhat direction lay their destination, and how far, they had not even the\nvaguest idea, but they were determined to go on.\n\n\"If ever we find this city of Arite, it'll be a miracle sure,\" the Very\nYoung Man remarked as they were walking along in silence.\n\nThey had gone only a short distance farther when the Big Business Man,\nwho was walking in front, stopped abruptly.\n\n\"What's that?\" he asked in a startled undertone.\n\nThey followed the direction of his hand, and saw, standing rigid against\na tree-trunk ahead, the figure of a man little more than half as tall as\nthemselves, his grayish body very nearly the color of the blue-gray tree\nbehind him.\n\nThe three adventurers stood motionless, staring in amazement.\n\nAs the Big Business Man spoke, the little figure, which had evidently\nbeen watching them for some time, turned irresolutely as though about to\nrun. Then with gathering courage it began walking slowly towards them,\nholding out its arms with the palm up.\n\n\"He's friendly,\" whispered the Very Young Man; and they waited, silent,\nas the man approached.\n\nAs he came closer, they could see he was hardly more than a boy, perhaps\ntwenty years of age. His lean, gray body was nearly naked. Around his\nwaist he wore a drab-colored tunic, of a substance they could not\nidentify. His feet and legs were bare. On his chest were strapped a thin\nstone plate, slightly convex. His thick, wavy, black hair, cut at the\nbase of his neck, hung close about his ears. His head was uncovered. His\nfeatures were regular and pleasing; his smile showed an even row of very\nwhite teeth.\n\nThe three men did not speak or move until, in a moment, more, he stood\ndirectly before them, still holding out his hands palm up. Then abruptly\nhe spoke.\n\n\"The Master welcomes his friends,\" he said in a soft musical voice. He\ngave the words a most curious accent and inflexion, yet they were quite\nunderstandable to his listeners.\n\n\"The Master welcomes his friends,\" he repeated, dropping his arms to his\nsides and smiling in a most friendly manner.\n\nThe Very Young Man caught his breath. \"He's been sent to meet us; he's\nfrom Rogers. What do you think of that? We're all right now!\" he\nexclaimed excitedly.\n\nThe Doctor held out his hand, and the Oroid, hesitating a moment in\ndoubt, finally reached up and grasped it.\n\n\"Are you from Rogers?\" asked the Doctor.\n\nThe Oroid looked puzzled. Then he turned and flung out his arm in a\nsweeping gesture towards the deeper woods before them. \"Rogers--Master,\"\nhe said.\n\n\"You were waiting for us?\" persisted the Doctor; but the other only\nshook his head and smiled his lack of comprehension.\n\n\"He only knows the first words he said,\" the Big Business Man suggested.\n\n\"He must be from Rogers,\" the Very Young Man put in. \"See, he wants us\nto go with him.\"\n\nThe Oroid was motioning them forward, holding out his hand as though to\nlead them.\n\nThe Very Young Man started forward, but the Big Business Man held him\nback.\n\n\"Wait a moment,\" he said. \"I don't think we ought to go among these\npeople as large as we are. Rogers is evidently alive and waiting for us.\nWhy wouldn't it be better to be about his size, instead of ten-foot\ngiants as we would look now?\"\n\n\"How do you know how big Rogers is?\" asked the Very Young Man.\n\n\"I think that a good idea,\" agreed the Doctor. \"Rogers described these\nOroid men as being some six inches shorter than himself, on the\naverage.\"\n\n\"This one might be a pygmy, for all we know,\" said the Very Young Man.\n\n\"We might chance it that he's of normal size,\" said the Doctor, smiling.\n\"I think we should make ourselves smaller.\"\n\nThe Oroid stood patiently by and watched them with interested eyes as\neach took a tiny pellet from a vial under his arm and touched it to his\ntongue. When they began to decrease in size his eyes widened with fright\nand his legs shook under him. But he stood his ground, evidently assured\nby their smiles and friendly gestures.\n\nIn a few minutes the action of the drug was over, and they found\nthemselves not more than a head taller than the Oroid. In this size he\nseemed to like them better, or at least he stood in far less awe of\nthem, for now he seized them by the arms and pulled them forward\nvigorously.\n\nThey laughingly yielded, and, led by this strange being of another\nworld, they turned from the open places they had been following and\nplunged into the depths of the forest.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nTHE CHEMIST AND HIS SON\n\n\nFor an hour or more the three adventurers followed their strange guide\nin silence through the dense, trackless woods. He walked very rapidly,\nlooking neither to the right nor to the left, finding his way apparently\nby an intuitive sense of direction. Occasionally he glanced back over\nhis shoulder and smiled.\n\nWalking through the woods here was not difficult, and the party made\nrapid progress. The huge, upstanding tree-trunks were devoid of limbs\nfor a hundred feet or more above the ground. On some of them a luxuriant\nvine was growing--a vine that bore a profusion of little gray berries.\nIn the branches high overhead a few birds flew to and fro, calling out\nat times with a soft, cooing note. The ground--a gray, finely powdered\nsandy loam--was carpeted with bluish fallen leaves, sometimes with a\nspecies of blue moss, and occasional ferns of a like color.\n\nThe forest was dense, deep, and silent; the tree branches overhead\nlocked together in a solid canopy, shutting out the black sky above. Yet\neven in this seclusion the scene remained as light as it had been\noutside the woods in the open. Darkness indeed was impossible in this\nland; under all circumstances the light seemed the same--neither too\nbright nor too dim--a comfortable, steady glow, restful, almost hypnotic\nin its sameness.\n\nThey had traveled perhaps six miles from the point where they met their\nOroid guide when suddenly the Very Young Man became aware that other\nOroids were with them. Looking to one side, he saw two more of these\nstrange gray men, silently stalking along, keeping pace with them.\nTurning, he made out still another, following a short distance behind.\nThe Very Young Man was startled, and hurriedly pointed them out to his\ncompanions.\n\n\"Wait,\" called the Doctor to their youthful guide, and abruptly the\nparty came to a halt.\n\nBy these signs they made their guide understand that they wanted these\nother men to come closer. The Oroid shouted to them in his own quaint\ntongue, words of a soft, liquid quality with a wistful sound--words\nwholly unintelligible to the adventurers.\n\nThe men came forward diffidently, six of them, for three others appeared\nout of the shadows of the forest, and stood in a group, talking among\nthemselves a little and smiling at their visitors. They were all dressed\nsimilarly to Lao--for such was the young Oroid's name--and all of them\nolder than he, and of nearly the same height.\n\n\"Do any of you speak English?\" asked the Doctor, addressing them\ndirectly.\n\nEvidently they did not, for they answered only by shaking their heads\nand by more smiles.\n\nThen one of them spoke. \"The Master welcomes his friends,\" he said. And\nall the others repeated it after him, like children in school repeating\nproudly a lesson newly learned.\n\nThe Doctor and his two friends laughed heartily, and, completely\nreassured by this exhibition of their friendliness, they signified to\nLao that they were ready again to go forward.\n\nAs they walked onward through the apparently endless and unchanging\nforest, surrounded by what the Very Young Man called their \"guard of\nhonor,\" they were joined from time to time by other Oroid men, all of\nwhom seemed to know who they were and where they were going, and who\nfell silently into line with them. Within an hour their party numbered\ntwenty or more.\n\nSeeing one of the natives stop a moment and snatch some berries from one\nof the vines with which many of the trees were encumbered, the Very\nYoung Man did the same. He found the berries sweet and palatable, and he\nate a quantity. Then discovering he was hungry, he took some crackers\nfrom his belt and ate them walking along. The Doctor and the Big\nBusiness Man ate also, for although they had not realized it, all three\nwere actually famished.\n\nShortly after this the party came to a broad, smooth-flowing river, its\nbanks lined with rushes, with here and there a little spot of gray,\nsandy beach. It was apparent from Lao's signs that they must wait at\nthis point for a boat to take them across. This they were glad enough to\ndo, for all three had gone nearly to the limit of their strength. They\ndrank deep of the pure river water, laved their aching limbs in it\ngratefully, and lay down, caring not a bit how long they were forced to\nwait.\n\nIn perhaps another hour the boat appeared. It came from down the river,\npropelled close inshore by two members of their own party who had gone\nto fetch it. At first the travelers thought it a long, oblong raft. Then\nas it came closer they could see it was constructed of three canoes,\neach about thirty feet long, hollowed out of tree-trunks. Over these was\nlaid a platform of small trees hewn roughly into boards. The boat was\npropelled by long, slender poles in the hands of the two men, who, one\non each side, dug them into the bed of the river and walked with them\nthe length of the platform.\n\nOn to this boat the entire party crowded and they were soon well out on\nthe shallow river, headed for its opposite bank. The Very Young Man,\nseated at the front end of the platform with his legs dangling over and\nhis feet only a few inches above the silver phosphorescence of the\nrippling water underneath, sighed luxuriously.\n\n\"This beats anything we've done yet,\" he murmured. \"Gee, it's nice\nhere!\"\n\nWhen they landed on the farther bank another group of natives was\nwaiting for them. The party, thus strengthened to nearly forty, started\noff immediately into the forest, which on this side of the river\nappeared equally dense and trackless.\n\nThey appeared now to be paralleling the course of the river a few\nhundred yards back from its bank. After half an hour of this traveling\nthey came abruptly to what at first appeared to be the mouth of a large\ncave, but which afterwards proved to be a tunnel-like passageway. Into\nthis opening the party unhesitatingly plunged.\n\nWithin this tunnel, which sloped downward at a considerable angle, they\nmade even more rapid progress than in the forest above. The tunnel walls\nhere were perhaps twenty feet apart--walls of a glistening, radiant,\ncrystalline rock. The roof of the passageway was fully twice as high as\nits width; its rocky floor was smooth and even.\n\nAfter a time this tunnel was crossed by another somewhat broader and\nhigher, but in general of similar aspect. It, too, sloped downward, more\nabruptly from the intersection. Into this latter passageway the party\nturned, still taking the downward course.\n\nAs they progressed, many other passageways were crossed, the\nintersections of which were wide at the open spaces. Occasionally the\ntravelers encountered other natives, all of them men, most of whom\nturned and followed them.\n\nThe Big Business Man, after over an hour of this rapid walking downward,\nwas again near the limit of his endurance, when the party, after\ncrossing a broad, open square, came upon a sort of sleigh, with two\nanimals harnessed to it. It was standing at the intersection of a still\nbroader, evidently more traveled passageway, and in it was an attendant,\napparently fast asleep.\n\nInto this sleigh climbed the three travelers with their guide Lao; and,\ndriven by the attendant, they started down the broader tunnel at a rapid\npace. The sleigh was balanced upon a broad single runner of polished\nstone, with a narrow, slightly shorter outrider on each side; it slid\nsmoothly and easily on this runner over the equally smooth, metallic\nrock of the ground.\n\nThe reindeer-like animals were harnessed by their heads to a single\nshaft. They were guided by a short, pointed pole in the hands of the\ndriver, who, as occasion demanded, dug it vigorously into their flanks.\n\nIn this manner the travelers rode perhaps half an hour more. The\npassageway sloped steeply downward, and they made good speed. Finally\nwithout warning, except by a sudden freshening of the air, they emerged\ninto the open, and found themselves facing a broad, rolling stretch of\ncountry, dotted here and there with trees--the country of the Oroids at\nlast.\n\nFor the first time since leaving their own world the adventurers found\nthemselves amid surroundings that at least held some semblance of an\naspect of familiarity. The scene they faced now might have been one of\ntheir own land viewed on an abnormally bright though moonless evening.\n\nFor some miles they could see a rolling, open country, curving slightly\nupward into the dimness of the distance. At their right, close by, lay a\nbroad lake, its surface wrinkled under a gentle breeze and gleaming\nbright as a great sheet of polished silver.\n\nOverhead hung a gray-blue, cloudless sky, studded with a myriad of\nfaint, twinkling, golden-silver stars. On the lake shore lay a\ncollection of houses, close together, at the water's edge and spreading\nback thinly into the hills behind. This they knew to be Arite--the city\nof their destination.\n\nAt the end of the tunnel they left the sleigh, and, turning down the\ngentle sloping hillside, leisurely approached the city. They were part\nway across an open field separating them from the nearest houses, when\nthey saw a group of figures coming across the field towards them. This\ngroup stopped when still a few hundred yards away, only two of the\nfigures continuing to come forward. They came onward steadily, the tall\nfigure of a man clothed in white, and by his side a slender, graceful\nboy.\n\nIn a moment more Lao, walking in front of the Doctor and his two\ncompanions, stopped suddenly and, turning to face them, said quietly,\n\"The Master.\"\n\nThe three travelers, with their hearts pounding, paused an instant. Then\nwith a shout the Very Young Man dashed forward, followed by his two\ncompanions.\n\n\"It's Rogers--it's Rogers!\" he called; and in a moment more the three\nmen were beside the Chemist, shaking his hand and pouring at him\nexcitedly their words of greeting.\n\nThe Chemist welcomed them heartily, but with a quiet, curious air of\ndignity that they did not remember he possessed before. He seemed to\nhave aged considerably since they had last seen him. The lines in his\nface had deepened; the hair on his temples was white. He seemed also to\nbe rather taller than they remembered him, and certainly he was stouter.\n\nHe was dressed in a long, flowing robe of white cloth, gathered in at\nthe waist by a girdle, from which hung a short sword, apparently of gold\nor of beaten brass. His legs were bare; on his feet he wore a form of\nsandal with leather thongs crossing his insteps. His hair grew long over\nhis ears and was cut off at the shoulder line in the fashion of the\nnatives.\n\nWhen the first words of greeting were over, the Chemist turned to the\nboy, who was standing apart, watching them with big, interested eyes.\n\n\"My friends,\" he said quietly, yet with a little underlying note of\npride in his voice, \"this is my son.\"\n\nThe boy approached deferentially. He was apparently about ten or eleven\nyears of age, tall as his father's shoulder nearly, extremely slight of\nbuild, yet with a body perfectly proportioned. He was dressed in a white\nrobe similar to his father's, only shorter, ending at his knees. His\nskin was of a curious, smooth, milky whiteness, lacking the gray, harder\nlook of that of the native men, and with just a touch of the iridescent\nquality possessed by the women. His features were cast in a delicate\nmold, pretty enough almost to be called girlish, yet with a firm\nsquareness of chin distinctly masculine.\n\nHis eyes were blue; his thick, wavy hair, falling to his shoulders, was\na chestnut brown. His demeanor was graceful and dignified, yet with a\ntouch of ingenuousness that marked him for the care-free child he really\nwas. He held out his hands palms up as he approached.\n\n\"My name is Loto,\" he said in a sweet, soft voice, with perfect\nself-possession. \"I'm glad to meet my father's friends.\" He spoke\nEnglish with just a trace of the liquid quality that characterized his\nmother's tongue.\n\n\"You are late getting here,\" remarked the Chemist with a smile, as the\nthree travelers, completely surprised by this sudden introduction,\ngravely shook hands with the boy.\n\nDuring this time the young Oroid who had guided them down from the\nforest above the tunnels, had been standing respectfully behind them, a\nfew feet away. A short distance farther on several small groups of\nnatives were gathered, watching the strangers. With a few swift words\nLoto now dismissed their guide, who bowed low with his hands to his\nforehead and left them.\n\nLed by the Chemist, they continued on down into the city, talking\nearnestly, telling him the details of their trip. The natives followed\nthem as they moved forward, and as they entered the city others looked\nat them curiously and, the Very Young Man thought, with a little\nhostility, yet always from a respectful distance. Evidently it was\nnight, or at least the time of sleep at this hour, for the streets they\npassed through were nearly deserted.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nTHE CITY OF ARITE\n\n\nThe city of Arite, as it looked to them now, was strange beyond anything\nthey had ever seen, but still by no means as extraordinary as they had\nexpected it would be. The streets through which they walked were broad\nand straight, and were crossed by others at regular intervals of two or\nthree hundred feet. These streets paralleled each other with\nmathematical regularity. The city thus was laid out most orderly, but\nwith one peculiarity; the streets did not run in two directions crossing\neach other at right angles, but in three, each inclined to an equal\ndegree with the others. The blocks of houses between them, therefore,\nwere cut into diamond-shaped sections and into triangles, never into\nsquares or oblongs.\n\nMost of the streets seemed paved with large, flat gray blocks of a\nsubstance resembling highly polished stone, or a form of opaque glass.\nThere were no sidewalks, but close up before the more pretentious of the\nhouses, were small trees growing.\n\nThe houses themselves were generally triangular or diamond-shaped,\nfollowing the slope of the streets. They were, most of them, but two\nstories in height, with flat roofs on some of which flowers and\ntrellised vines were growing. They were built principally of the same\nsmooth, gray blocks with which the streets were paved. Their windows\nwere large and numerous, without window-panes, but closed now, nearly\nall of them by shining, silvery curtains that looked as though they\nmight have been woven from the metal itself. The doors were of heavy\nmetal, suggesting brass or gold. On some of the houses tiny low-railed\nbalconies hung from the upper windows out over the street.\n\nThe party proceeded quietly through this now deserted city, crossing a\nlarge tree-lined square, or park, that by the confluence of many streets\nseemed to mark its center, and turned finally into another diagonal\nstreet that dropped swiftly down towards the lake front. At the edge of\na promontory this street abruptly terminated in a broad flight of steps\nleading down to a little beach on the lake shore perhaps a hundred feet\nbelow.\n\nThe Chemist turned sharp to the right at the head of these steps, and,\npassing through the opened gateway of an arch in a low gray wall, led\nhis friends into a garden in which were growing a profusion of flowers.\nThese flowers, they noticed, were most of them blue or gray, or of a\npale silvery whiteness, lending to the scene a peculiarly wan, wistful\nappearance, yet one of extraordinary, quite unearthly beauty.\n\nThrough the garden a little gray-pebbled path wound back to where a\nhouse stood, nearly hidden in a grove of trees, upon a bluff directly\noverlooking the lake.\n\n\"My home, gentlemen,\" said the Chemist, with a wave of his hand.\n\nAs they approached the house they heard, coming from within, the mellow\nvoice of a woman singing--an odd little minor theme, with a quaint,\nlilting rhythm, and words they could not distinguish. Accompanying the\nvoice were the delicate tones of some stringed instrument suggesting a\nharp.\n\n\"We are expected,\" remarked the Chemist with a smile. \"Lylda is still\nup, waiting for us.\" The Very Young Man's heart gave a leap at the\nmention of the name.\n\nFrom the outside, the Chemist's house resembled many of the larger ones\nthey had seen as they came through the city. It was considerably more\npretentious than any they had yet noticed, diamond-shaped--that is to\nsay, a flattened oblong--two stories in height and built of large blocks\nof the gray polished stone.\n\nUnlike the other houses, its sides were not bare, but were partly\ncovered by a luxuriant growth of vines and trellised flowers. There were\nno balconies under its windows, except on the lake side. There, at the\nheight of the second story, a covered balcony broad enough almost to be\ncalled a veranda, stretched the full width of the house.\n\nA broad door of brass, fronting the garden, stood partly open, and the\nChemist pushed it wide and ushered in his friends. They found themselves\nnow in a triangular hallway, or lobby, with an open arch in both its\nother sides giving passage into rooms beyond. Through one of these\narchways the Chemist led them, into what evidently was the main\nliving-room of the dwelling.\n\nIt was a high-ceilinged room nearly triangular in shape, thirty feet\npossibly at its greatest width. In one wall were set several\nsilvery-curtained windows, opening out on to the lake. On the other side\nwas a broad fireplace and hearth with another archway beside it leading\nfarther into the house. The walls of the room were lined with small gray\ntiles; the floor also was tiled with gray and white, set in design.\n\nOn the floor were spread several large rugs, apparently made of grass or\nfibre. The walls were bare, except between the windows, where two long,\nnarrow, heavily embroidered strips of golden cloth were hanging.\n\nIn the center of the room stood a circular stone table, its top a highly\npolished black slab of stone. This table was set now for a meal, with\ngolden metal dishes, huge metal goblets of a like color, and beautifully\nwrought table utensils, also of gold. Around the table were several\nsmall chairs, made of wicker. In the seat of each lay a padded fiber\ncushion, and over the back was hung a small piece of embroidered cloth.\n\nWith the exception of these chairs and table, the room was practically\ndevoid of furniture. Against one wall was a smaller table of stone, with\na few miscellaneous objects on its top, and under each window stood a\nsmall white stone bench.\n\nA fire glowed in the fireplace grate--a fire that burned without flame.\nOn the hearth before it, reclining on large silvery cushions, was a\nwoman holding in her hands a small stringed instrument like a tiny harp\nor lyre. When the men entered the room she laid her instrument aside and\nrose to her feet.\n\nAs she stood there for an instant, expectant, with the light of welcome\nin her eyes, the three strangers beheld what to them seemed the most\nperfect vision of feminine loveliness they had ever seen.\n\nThe woman's age was at first glance indeterminate. By her face, her\nlong, slender, yet well-rounded neck, and the slim curves of her girlish\nfigure, she might have been hardly more than twenty. Yet in her bearing\nthere was that indefinable poise and dignity that bespoke the more\nmature, older woman.\n\nShe was about five feet tall, with a slender, almost fragile, yet\nperfectly rounded body. Her dress consisted of a single flowing garment\nof light-blue silk, reaching from the shoulders to just above her knees.\nIt was girdled at the waist by a thick golden cord that hung with golden\ntasseled pendants at her side.\n\nA narrower golden cord crossed her breast and shoulders. Her arms, legs,\nand shoulders were bare. Her skin was smooth as satin, milky white, and\nsuffused with the delicate tints of many colors. Her hair was thick and\nvery black; it was twisted into two tresses that fell forward over each\nshoulder nearly to her waist and ended with a little silver ribbon and\ntassel tied near the bottom.\n\nHer face was a delicate oval. Her lips were full and of a color for\nwhich in English there is no name. It would have been red doubtless by\nsunlight in the world above, but here in this silver light of\nphosphorescence, the color red, as we see it, was impossible.\n\nHer nose was small, of Grecian type. Her slate-gray eyes were rather\nlarge, very slightly upturned at the corners, giving just a touch of the\nlook of our women of the Orient. Her lashes were long and very black. In\nconversation she lowered them at times with a charming combination of\nfeminine humility and a touch of coquetry. Her gaze from under them had\noften a peculiar look of melting softness, yet always it was direct and\nhonest.\n\nSuch was the woman who quietly stood beside her hearth, waiting to\nwelcome these strange guests from another world.\n\nAs the men entered through the archway, the boy Loto pushed quickly past\nthem in his eagerness to get ahead, and, rushing across the room, threw\nhimself into the woman's arms crying happily, \"_Mita, mita._\"\n\nThe woman kissed him affectionately. Then, before she had time to speak,\nthe boy pulled her forward, holding her tightly by one hand.\n\n\"This is my mother,\" he said with a pretty little gesture. \"Her name is\nLylda.\"\n\nThe woman loosened herself from his grasp with a smile of amusement,\nand, native fashion, bowed low with her hands to her forehead.\n\n\"My husband's friends are welcome,\" she said simply. Her voice was soft\nand musical. She spoke English perfectly, with an intonation of which\nthe most cultured woman might be proud, but with a foreign accent much\nmore noticeable than that of her son.\n\n\"A very long time we have been waiting for you,\" she added; and then, as\nan afterthought, she impulsively offered them her hand in their own\nmanner.\n\nThe Chemist kissed his wife quietly. In spite of the presence of\nstrangers, for a moment she dropped her reserve, her arms went up around\nhis neck, and she clung to him an instant. Gently putting her down, the\nChemist turned to his friends.\n\n\"I think Lylda has supper waiting,\" he said. Then as he looked at their\ntorn, woolen suits that once were white, and the ragged shoes upon their\nfeet, he added with a smile, \"But I think I can make you much more\ncomfortable first.\"\n\nHe led them up a broad, curving flight of stone steps to a room above,\nwhere they found a shallow pool of water, sunk below the level of the\nfloor. Here he left them to bathe, getting them meanwhile robes similar\nto his own, with which to replace their own soiled garments. In a little\nwhile, much refreshed, they descended to the room below, where Lylda had\nsupper ready upon the table waiting for them.\n\n\"Only a little while ago my father and Aura left,\" said Lylda, as they\nsat down to eat.\n\n\"Lylda's younger sister,\" the Chemist explained. \"She lives with her\nfather here in Arite.\"\n\nThe Very Young Man parted his lips to speak. Then, with heightened color\nin his cheeks, he closed them again.\n\nThey were deftly served at supper by a little native girl who was\ndressed in a short tunic reaching from waist to knees, with circular\ndiscs of gold covering her breasts. There was cooked meat for the meal,\na white starchy form of vegetable somewhat resembling a potato, a number\nof delicious fruits of unfamiliar variety, and for drink the juice of a\nfruit that tasted more like cider than anything they could name.\n\nAt the table Loto perched himself beside the Very Young Man, for whom he\nseemed to have taken a sudden fancy.\n\n\"I like you,\" he said suddenly, during a lull in the talk.\n\n\"I like you, too,\" answered the Very Young Man.\n\n\"Aura is very beautiful; you'll like her.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I will,\" the Very Young Man agreed soberly.\n\n\"What's your name?\" persisted the boy.\n\n\"My name's Jack. And I'm glad you like me. I think we're friends, don't\nyou?\"\n\nAnd so they became firm friends, and, as far as circumstances would\npermit, inseparable companions.\n\nLylda presided over the supper with the charming grace of a competent\nhostess. She spoke seldom, yet when the conversation turned to the great\nworld above in which her husband was born, she questioned intelligently\nand with eager interest. Evidently she had a considerable knowledge of\nthe subject, but with an almost childish insatiable curiosity she sought\nfrom her guests more intimate details of the world they lived in.\n\nWhen in lighter vein their talk ran into comments upon the social life\nof their own world, Lylda's ready wit, combined with her ingenuous\nsimplicity, put to them many questions which made the giving of an\nunderstandable answer sometimes amusingly difficult.\n\nWhen the meal was over the three travelers found themselves very sleepy,\nand all of them were glad when the Chemist suggested that they retire\nalmost immediately. He led them again to the upper story into the\nbedroom they were to occupy. There, on the low bedsteads, soft with many\nquilted coverings, they passed the remainder of the time of sleep in\ndreamless slumber, utterly worn out by their journey, nor guessing what\nthe morning would bring forth.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nTHE WORLD OF THE RING\n\n\nNext morning after breakfast the four men sat upon the balcony\noverlooking the lake, and prepared to hear the Chemist's narrative of\nwhat had happened since he left them five years before. They had already\ntold him of events in their world, the making of the chemicals and their\njourney down into the ring, and now they were ready to hear his story.\n\nAt their ease here upon the balcony, reclining in long wicker chairs of\nthe Chemist's own design, as he proudly admitted, they felt at peace\nwith themselves and the world. Below them lay the shining lake, above\nspread a clear, star-studded sky. Against their faces blew the cool\nbreath of a gentle summer's breeze.\n\nAs they sat silent for a moment, enjoying almost with awe the beauties\nof the scene, and listening to the soft voice of Lylda singing to\nherself in the garden, the Very Young Man suddenly thought of the one\nthing lacking to make his enjoyment perfect.\n\n\"I wish I had a cigarette,\" he remarked wistfully.\n\nThe Chemist with a smile produced cigars of a leaf that proved a very\ngood substitute for tobacco. They lighted them with a tiny metal lighter\nof the flint-and-steel variety, filled with a fluffy inflammable wick--a\ncontrivance of the Chemist's own making--and then he started his\nnarrative.\n\n\"There is much to tell you, my friends,\" he began thoughtfully. \"Much\nthat will interest you, shall we say from a socialistic standpoint? I\nshall make it brief, for we have no time to sit idly talking.\n\n\"I must tell you now, gentlemen, of what I think you have so far not\neven had a hint. You have found me living here,\" he hesitated and\nsmiled, \"well at least under pleasant and happy circumstances. Yet as a\nmatter of fact, your coming was of vital importance, not only to me and\nmy family, but probably to the future welfare of the entire Oroid\nnation.\n\n\"We are approaching a crisis here with which I must confess I have felt\nmyself unable to cope. With your help, more especially with the power of\nthe chemicals you have brought with you, it may be possible for us to\ndeal successfully with the conditions facing us.\"\n\n\"What are they?\" asked the Very Young Man eagerly.\n\n\"Perhaps it would be better for me to tell you chronologically the\nevents as they have occurred. As you remember when I left you twelve\nyears ago----\"\n\n\"Five years,\" interrupted the Very Young Man.\n\n\"Five or twelve, as you please,\" said the Chemist smiling. \"It was my\nintention then, as you know, to come back to you after a comparatively\nshort stay here.\"\n\n\"And bring Mrs.--er--Lylda, with you,\" put in the Very Young Man,\nhesitating in confusion over the Christian name.\n\n\"And bring Lylda with me,\" finished the Chemist. \"I got back here\nwithout much difficulty, and in a very much shorter time and with less\neffort than on my first trip. I tried an entirely different method; I\nstayed as large as possible while descending, and diminished my size\nmaterially only after I had reached the bottom.\"\n\n\"I told you----\" said the Big Business Man.\n\n\"It was a dangerous method of procedure, but I made it successfully\nwithout mishap.\n\n\"Lylda and I were married in native fashion shortly after I reached\nArite.\"\n\n\"How was that; what fashion?\" the Very Young Man wanted to know, but the\nChemist went on.\n\n\"It was my intention to stay here only a few weeks and then return with\nLylda. She was willing to follow me anywhere I might take her,\nbecause--well, perhaps you would hardly understand, but--women here are\ndifferent in many ways than you know them.\n\n\"I stayed several months, still planning to leave almost at any time. I\nfound this world an intensely interesting study. Then, when--Loto was\nexpected, I again postponed my departure.\n\n\"I had been here over a year before I finally gave up my intention of\never returning to you. I have no close relatives above, you know, no one\nwho cares much for me or for whom I care, and my life seemed thoroughly\nestablished here.\n\n\"I am afraid gentlemen, I am offering excuses for myself--for my\ndesertion of my own country in its time of need. I have no defense. As\nevents turned out I could not have helped probably, very much, but\nstill--that is no excuse. I can only say that your world up there seemed\nso very--very--far away. Events up there had become to me only vague\nmemories as of a dream. And Lylda and my little son were so near, so\nreal and vital to me. Well, at any rate I stayed, deciding definitely to\nmake my home and to end my days here.\"\n\n\"What did you do about the drugs?\" asked the Doctor.\n\n\"I kept them hidden carefully for nearly a year,\" the Chemist replied.\n\"Then fearing lest they should in some way get loose, I destroyed them.\nThey possess a diabolical power, gentlemen; I am afraid of it.\"\n\n\"They called you the Master,\" suggested the Very Young Man, after a\npause. \"Why was that?\"\n\nThe Chemist smiled. \"They do call me the Master. That has been for\nseveral years. I suppose I am the most important individual in the\nnation to-day.\"\n\n\"I should think you would be,\" said the Very Young Man quickly. \"What\nyou did, and with the knowledge you have.\"\n\nThe Chemist went on. \"Lylda and I lived with her father and Aura--her\nmother is dead you know--until after Loto was born. Then we had a house\nfurther up in the city. Later, about eight years ago, I built this house\nwe now occupy and Lylda laid out its garden which she is tremendously\nproud of, and which I think is the finest in Arite.\n\n\"Because of what I had done in the Malite war, I became naturally the\nKing's adviser. Every one felt me the savior of the nation, which, in a\nway, I suppose I was. I never used the drugs again and, as only a very\nfew of the people ever understood them, or in fact ever knew of them or\nbelieved in their existence, my extraordinary change in stature was\nascribed to some supernatural power. I have always since been credited\nwith being able to exert that power at will, although I never used it\nbut that once.\"\n\n\"You have it again now,\" said the Doctor smiling.\n\n\"Yes, I have, thank God,\" answered the Chemist fervently, \"though I hope\nI never shall have to use it.\"\n\n\"Aren't you planning to go back with us,\" asked the Very Young Man,\n\"even for a visit?\"\n\nThe Chemist shook his head. \"My way lies here,\" he said quietly, yet\nwith deep feeling.\n\nA silence followed; finally the Chemist roused himself from his reverie,\nand went on. \"Although I never again changed my stature, there were a\nthousand different ways in which I continued to make myself--well,\nfamous throughout the land. I have taught these people many things,\ngentlemen--like this for instance.\" He indicated his cigar, and the\nchair in which he was sitting. \"You cannot imagine what a variety of\nthings one knows beyond the knowledge of so primitive a race as this.\n\n\"And so gradually, I became known as the Master. I have no official\nposition, but everywhere I am known by that name. As a matter of fact,\nfor the past year at least, it has been rather too descriptive a\ntitle----\" the Chemist smiled somewhat ruefully--\"for I have had in\nreality, and have now, the destiny of the country on my shoulders.\"\n\n\"You're not threatened with another war?\" asked the Very Young Man.\n\n\"No, not exactly that. But I had better go on with my story first. This\nis a very different world now, gentlemen, from that I first entered\ntwelve years ago. I think first I should tell you about it as it was\nthen.\"\n\nHis three friends nodded their agreement and the Chemist continued.\n\n\"I must make it clear to you gentlemen, the one great fundamental\ndifference between this world and yours. In the evolution of this race\nthere has been no cause for strife--the survival of the fittest always\nhas been an unknown doctrine--a non-existent problem.\n\n\"In extent this Inner Surface upon which we are now living is nearly as\ngreat as the surface of your own earth. From the earliest known times it\nhas been endowed with a perfect climate--a climate such as you are now\nenjoying.\"\n\nThe Very Young Man expanded his chest and looked his appreciation.\n\n\"The climate, the rainfall, everything is ideal for crops and for living\nconditions. In the matter of food, one needs in fact do practically\nnothing. Fruits of a variety ample to sustain life, grow wild in\nabundance. Vegetables planted are harvested seemingly without blight or\nhazard of any kind. No destructive insects have ever impeded\nagriculture; no wild animals have ever existed to harass humanity.\nNature in fact, offers every help and no obstacle towards making a\nsimple, primitive life easy to live.\n\n\"Under such conditions the race developed only so far as was necessary\nto ensure a healthful pleasant existence. Civilization here is what you\nwould call primitive: wants are few and easily supplied--too easily,\nprobably, for without strife these people have become--well shall I say\neffeminate? They are not exactly that--it is not a good word.\"\n\n\"I should think that such an unchanging, unrigorous climate would make a\nrace deteriorate in physique rapidly,\" observed the Doctor.\n\n\"How about disease down here?\" asked the Big Business Man.\n\n\"It is a curious thing,\" replied the Chemist. \"Cleanliness seems to be a\ntrait inborn with every individual in this race. It is more than\ngodliness; it is the one great cardinal virtue. You must have noticed\nit, just in coming through Arite. Personal cleanliness of the people,\nand cleanliness of houses, streets--of everything. It is truly\nextraordinary to what extent they go to make everything inordinately,\nimmaculately clean. Possibly for that reason, and because there seems\nnever to have been any serious disease germs existing here, sickness as\nyou know it, does not exist.\"\n\n\"Guess you better not go into business here,\" said the Very Young Man\nwith a grin at the Doctor.\n\n\"There is practically no illness worthy of the name,\" went on the\nChemist. \"The people live out their lives and, barring accident, die\npeacefully of old age.\"\n\n\"How old do they live to be?\" asked the Big Business Man.\n\n\"About the same as with you,\" answered the Chemist. \"Only of course as\nwe measure time.\"\n\n\"Say how about that?\" the Very Young Man asked. \"My watch is still\ngoing--is it ticking out the old time or the new time down here?\"\n\n\"I should say probably--certainly--it was giving time of your own world,\njust as it always did,\" the Chemist replied.\n\n\"Well, there's no way of telling, is there?\" said the Big Business Man.\n\n\"What is the exact difference in time?\" the Doctor asked.\n\n\"That is something I have had no means of determining. It was rather a\ncurious thing; when I left that letter for you,\" the Chemist turned to\nthe Doctor--\"it never occurred to me that although I had told you to\nstart down here on a certain day, I would be quite at a loss to\ncalculate when that day had arrived. It was my estimation after my first\ntrip here that time in this world passed at a rate about two and\ntwo-fifth times faster than it does in your world. That is as near as I\never came to it. We can calculate it more closely now, since we have\nonly the interval of your journey down as an indeterminate quantity.\"\n\n\"How near right did you hit it? When did you expect us?\" asked the\nDoctor.\n\n\"About thirty days ago; I have been waiting since then. I sent nearly a\nhundred men through the tunnels into the forest to guide you in.\"\n\n\"You taught them pretty good English,\" said the Very Young Man. \"They\nwere tickled to death that they knew it, too,\" he added with a\nreminiscent grin.\n\n\"You say about thirty days; how do you measure time down here?\" asked\nthe Big Business Man.\n\n\"I call a day, one complete cycle of sleeping and eating,\" the Chemist\nreplied. \"I suppose that is the best translation of the Oroid word; we\nhave a word that means about the same thing.\"\n\n\"How long is a day?\" inquired the Very Young Man.\n\n\"It seems in the living about the same as your twenty-four hours; it\noccupies probably about the interval of time of ten hours in your world.\n\n\"You see,\" the Chemist went on, \"we ordinarily eat twice between each\ntime of sleep--once after rising--and once a few hours before bedtime.\nWorkers at severe muscular labor sometimes eat a light meal in between,\nbut the custom is not general. Time is generally spoken of as so many\nmeals, rather than days.\"\n\n\"But what is the arbitrary standard?\" asked the Doctor. \"Do you have an\nequivalent for weeks, or months or years?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered the Chemist, \"based on astronomy the same as in your\nworld. But I would rather not explain that now. I want to take you,\nlater to-day, to see Lylda's father. You will like him. He is--well,\nwhat we might call a scientist. He talks English fairly well. We can\ndiscuss astronomy with him; you will find him very interesting.\"\n\n\"How can you tell time?\" the Very Young Man wanted to know. \"There is no\nsun to go by. You have no clocks, have you?\"\n\n\"There is one downstairs,\" answered the Chemist, \"but you didn't notice\nit. Lylda's father has a very fine one; he will show it to you.\"\n\n\"It seems to me,\" began the Doctor thoughtfully after a pause, reverting\nto their previous topic, \"that without sickness, under such ideal living\nconditions as you say exist here, in a very short time this world would\nbe over-populated.\"\n\n\"Nature seems to have taken care of that,\" the Chemist answered, \"and as\na matter of fact quite the reverse is true. Women mature in life at an\nage you would call about sixteen. But early marriages are not the rule;\nseldom is a woman married before she is twenty--frequently she is much\nolder. Her period of child-bearing, too, is comparatively\nshort--frequently less than ten years. The result is few children, whose\nrate of mortality is exceedingly slow.\"\n\n\"How about the marriages?\" the Very Young Man suggested. \"You were going\nto tell us.\"\n\n\"Marriages are by mutual consent,\" answered the Chemist, \"solemnized by\na simple, social ceremony. They are for a stated period of time, and are\nrenewed later if both parties desire. When a marriage is dissolved\nchildren are cared for by the mother generally, and her maintenance if\nnecessary is provided for by the government. The state becomes the\nguardian also of all illegitimate children and children of unknown\nparentage. But of both these latter classes there are very few. They\nwork for the government, as do many other people, until they are of age,\nwhen they become free to act as they please.\"\n\n\"You spoke about women being different than we knew them; how are they\ndifferent?\" the Very Young Man asked. \"If they're all like Lylda I think\nthey're great,\" he added enthusiastically, flushing a little at his own\ntemerity.\n\nThe Chemist smiled his acknowledgment of the compliment. \"The status of\nwomen--and their character--is I think one of the most remarkable things\nabout this race. You will remember, when I returned from here the first\ntime, that I was much impressed by the kindliness of these people.\nBecause of their history and their government they seem to have become\nimbued with the milk of human kindness to a degree approaching the\nUtopian.\n\n\"Crime here is practically non-existent; there is nothing over which\ncontention can arise. What crimes are committed are punished with a\nseverity seemingly out of all proportion to what you would call justice.\nA persistent offender even of fairly trivial wrongdoing is put to death\nwithout compunction. There is no imprisonment, except for those awaiting\ntrial. Punishment is a reprimand with the threat of death if the offense\nis committed again, or death itself immediately. Probably this very\nseverity and the swiftness with which punishment is meted out, to a\nlarge extent discourages wrongdoing. But, fundamentally, the capacity\nfor doing wrong is lacking in these people.\n\n\"I have said practically nothing exists over which contention can arise.\nThat is not strictly true. No race of people can develop without some\nindividual contention over the possession of their women. The passions\nof love, hate and jealousy, centering around sex and its problems, are\nas necessarily present in human beings as life itself.\n\n\"Love here is deep, strong and generally lasting; it lacks fire,\nintensity--perhaps. I should say it is rather of a placid quality.\nHatred seldom exists; jealousy is rare, because both sexes, in their\nactions towards the other, are guided by a spirit of honesty and\nfairness that is really extraordinary. This is true particularly of the\nwomen; they are absolutely honest--square, through and through.\n\n\"Crimes against women are few, yet in general they are the most\nprevalent type we have. They are punishable by death--even those that\nyou would characterize as comparatively slight offenses. It is\nsignificant too, that, in judging these crimes, but little evidence is\nrequired. A slight chain of proven circumstances and the word of the\nwoman is all that is required.\n\n\"This you will say, places a tremendous power in the hands of women. It\ndoes; yet they realize it thoroughly, and justify it. Although they know\nthat almost at their word a man will be put to death, practically never,\nI am convinced, is this power abused. With extreme infrequency, a female\nis proven guilty of lying. The penalty is death, for there is no place\nhere for such a woman!\n\n\"The result is that women are accorded a freedom of movement far beyond\nanything possible in your world. They are safe from harm. Their morals\nare, according to the standard here, practically one hundred per cent\nperfect. With short-term marriages, dissolvable at will, there is no\nreason why they should be otherwise. Curiously enough too, marriages are\nrenewed frequently--more than that, I should say, generally--for\nlife-long periods. Polygamy with the consent of all parties is\npermitted, but seldom practiced. Polyandry is unlawful, and but few\ncases of it ever appear.\n\n\"You may think all this a curious system, gentlemen, but it works.\"\n\n\"That's the answer,\" muttered the Very Young Man. It was obvious he was\nstill thinking of Lylda and her sister and with a heightened admiration\nand respect.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nA LIFE WORTH LIVING\n\n\nThe appearance of Lylda at one of the long windows of the balcony,\ninterrupted the men for a moment. She was dressed in a tunic of silver,\nof curious texture, like flexible woven metal, reaching to her knees. On\nher feet were little fiber sandals. Her hair was twisted in coils, piled\nupon her head, with a knot low at the back of the neck. From her head in\ngraceful folds hung a thin scarf of gold.\n\nShe stood waiting in the window a moment for them to notice her; then\nshe said quietly, \"I am going for a time to the court.\" She hesitated an\ninstant over the words. The Chemist inclined his head in agreement, and\nwith a smile at her guests, and a little bow, she withdrew.\n\nThe visitors looked inquiringly at their host.\n\n\"I must tell you about our government,\" said the Chemist. \"Lylda plays\nquite an important part in it.\" He smiled at their obvious surprise.\n\n\"The head of the government is the king. In reality he is more like the\npresident of a republic; he is chosen by the people to serve for a\nperiod of about twenty years. The present king is now in--well let us\nsay about the fifteenth year of his service. This translation of time\nperiods into English is confusing,\" he interjected somewhat\napologetically. \"We shall see the king to-morrow; you will find him a\nmost intelligent, likeable man.\n\n\"As a sort of congress, the king has one hundred and fifty advisers,\nhalf of them women, who meet about once a month. Lylda is one of these\nwomen. He also has an inner circle of closer, more intimate counselors\nconsisting of four men and four women. One of these women is the queen;\nanother is Lylda. I am one of the men.\n\n\"The capital of the nation is Arite. Each of the other cities governs\nitself in so far as its own local problems are concerned according to a\nsomewhat similar system, but all are under the central control of the\nArite government.\"\n\n\"How about the country in between, the--the rural population?\" asked the\nBig Business Man.\n\n\"It is all apportioned off to the nearest city,\" answered the Chemist.\n\"Each city controls a certain amount of the land around it.\n\n\"This congress of one hundred and fifty is the law-making body. The\njudiciary is composed of one court in each city. There is a leader of\nthe court, or judge, and a jury of forty--twenty men and twenty women.\nThe juries are chosen for continuous service for a period of five years.\nLylda is at present serving in the Arite court. They meet very\ninfrequently and irregularly, called as occasion demands. A two-thirds\nvote is necessary for a decision; there is no appeal.\"\n\n\"Are there any lawyers?\" asked the Big Business Man.\n\n\"There is no one who makes that his profession, no. Generally the\naccused talks for himself or has some relative, or possibly some friend\nto plead his case.\"\n\n\"You have police?\" the Doctor asked.\n\n\"A very efficient police force, both for the cities and in the country.\nReally they are more like detectives than police; they are the men I\nsent up into the forest to meet you. We also have an army, which at\npresent consists almost entirely of this same police force. After the\nMalite war it was of course very much larger, but of late years it has\nbeen disbanded almost completely.\n\n\"How about money?\" the Very Young Man wanted to know.\n\n\"There is none!\" answered the Chemist with a smile.\n\n\"Great Scott, how can you manage that?\" ejaculated the Big Business Man.\n\n\"Our industrial system undoubtedly is peculiar,\" the Chemist replied,\n\"but I can only say again, it works. We have no money, and, so far, none\napparently is needed. Everything is bought and sold as an exchange. For\ninstance, suppose I wish to make a living as a farmer. I have my\nland----\"\n\n\"How did you get it?\" interrupted the Very Young Man quickly.\n\n\"All the land is divided up _pro rata_ and given by each city to its\ncitizens. At the death of its owner it reverts to the government, and\neach citizen coming of age receives his share from the surplus always\nremaining.\"\n\n\"What about women? Can they own land too?\" asked the Very Young Man.\n\n\"They have identical rights with men in everything,\" the Chemist\nanswered.\n\n\"But women surely cannot cultivate their own land?\" the Doctor said.\nEvidently he was thinking of Lylda's fragile little body, and certainly\nif most of the Oroid women were like her, labour in the fields would be\nfor them quite impossible.\n\n\"A few women, by choice, do some of the lighter forms of manual\nlabor--but they are very few. Nearly every woman marries within a few\nyears after she receives her land; if it is to be cultivated, her\nhusband then takes charge of it.\"\n\n\"Is the cultivation of land compulsory?\" asked the Big Business Man.\n\n\"Only when in a city's district a shortage of food is threatened. Then\nthe government decides the amount and kind of food needed, and the\ncitizens, drawn by lot, are ordered to produce it. The government\nwatches very carefully its food supply. In the case of overproduction,\ncertain citizens, those less skillful, are ordered to work at something\nelse.\n\n\"This supervision over supply and demand is exercised by the government\nnot only in the question of food but in manufactures, in fact, in all\nindustrial activities. A very nice balance is obtained, so that\npractically no unnecessary work is done throughout the nation.\n\n\"And gentlemen, do you know, as a matter of fact, I think that is the\nsecret of a race of people being able to live without having to work\nmost of its waking hours? If your civilization could eliminate all its\nunnecessary work, there would be far less work to do.\"\n\n\"I wonder--isn't this balance of supply and demand very difficult to\nmaintain?\" asked the Big Business Man thoughtfully.\n\n\"Not nearly so difficult as you would think,\" the Chemist answered. \"In\nthe case of land cultivation, the government has a large reserve, the\ncultivation of which it adjusts to maintain this balance. Thus, in some\ndistricts, the citizens do as they please and are never interfered with.\n\n\"The same is true of manufactures. There is no organized business in the\nnation--not even so much as the smallest factory--except that conducted\nby the government. Each city has its own factories, whose production is\ncarefully planned exactly to equal the demand.\"\n\n\"Suppose a woman marries and her land is far away from her husband's?\nThat would be sort of awkward, wouldn't it?\" suggested the Very Young\nMan.\n\n\"Each year at a stated time,\" the Chemist answered, \"transfers of land\nare made. There are generally enough people who want to move to make\nsatisfactory changes of location practical. And then of course, the\ngovernment always stands ready to take up any two widely separate pieces\nof land, and give others in exchange out of its reserve.\"\n\n\"Suppose you don't like the new land as well?\" objected the Very Young\nMan.\n\n\"Almost all land is of equal value,\" answered the Chemist. \"And of\ncourse, its state of cultivation is always considered.\"\n\n\"You were speaking about not having money,\" prompted the Very Young Man.\n\n\"The idea is simply this: Suppose I wish to cultivate nothing except,\nlet us say, certain vegetables. I register with the government my\nintention and the extent to which I propose to go. I receive the\ngovernment's consent. I then take my crops as I harvest them and\nexchange them for every other article I need.\"\n\n\"With whom do you exchange them?\" asked the Doctor.\n\n\"Any one I please--or with the government. Ninety per cent of everything\nproduced is turned in to the government and other articles are taken\nfrom its stores.\"\n\n\"How is the rate of exchange established?\" asked the Big Business Man.\n\n\"It is computed by the government. Private exchanges are supposed to be\nmade at the same rate. It is against the law to cut under the government\nrate. But it is done, although apparently not with sufficient frequency\nto cause any trouble.\"\n\n\"I should think it would be tremendously complicated and annoying to\nmake all these exchanges,\" observed the Big Business Man.\n\n\"Not at all,\" answered the Chemist, \"because of the governmental system\nof credits. The financial standing of every individual is carefully kept\non record.\"\n\n\"Without any money? I don't get you,\" said the Very Young Man with a\nfrown of bewilderment.\n\nThe Chemist smiled. \"Well, I don't blame you for that. But I think I can\nmake myself clear. Let us take the case of Loto, for instance, as an\nindividual. When he comes of age he will be allotted his section of\nland. We will assume him to be without family at that time, entirely\ndependent on his own resources.\"\n\n\"Would he never have worked before coming of age?\" the Very Young Man\nasked.\n\n\"Children with parents generally devote their entire minority to getting\nan education, and to building their bodies properly. Without parents,\nthey are supported by the government and live in public homes. Such\nchildren, during their adolescence, work for the government a small\nportion of their time.\n\n\"Now when Loto comes of age and gets his land, located approximately\nwhere he desires it, he will make his choice as to his vocation. Suppose\nhe wishes not to cultivate his land but to work for the government. He\nis given some congenial, suitable employment at which he works\napproximately five hours a day. No matter what he elects to do at the\ntime he comes of age the government opens an account with him. He is\ncredited with a certain standard unit for his work, which he takes from\nthe government in supplies at his own convenience.\"\n\n\"What is the unit?\" asked the Big Business Man.\n\n\"It is the average work produced by the average worker in one\nday--purely an arbitrary figure.\"\n\n\"Like our word horse-power?\" put in the Doctor.\n\n\"Exactly. And all merchandise, food and labor is valued in terms of it.\n\n\"Thus you see, every individual has his financial standing--all in\nrelation to the government. He can let his balance pile up if he is\nable, or he can keep it low.\"\n\n\"Suppose he goes into debt?\" suggested the Very Young Man.\n\n\"In the case of obvious, verified necessity, the government will allow\nhim a limited credit. Persistent--shall I say willful--debt is a crime.\"\n\n\"I thought at first,\" said the Big Business Man, \"that everybody in this\nnation was on the same financial footing--that there was no premium put\nupon skill or industriousness. Now I see that one can accumulate, if not\nmoney, at least an inordinate amount of the world's goods.\"\n\n\"Not such an inordinate amount,\" said the Chemist smiling. \"Because\nthere is no inheritance. A man and woman, combining their worldly\nwealth, may by industry acquire more than others, but they are welcome\nto enjoy it. And they cannot, in one lifetime, get such a preponderance\nof wealth as to cause much envy from those lacking it.\"\n\n\"What happens to this house when you and Lylda die, if Loto cannot have\nit?\" the Big Business Man asked.\n\n\"It is kept in repair by the government and held until some one with a\nsufficiently large balance wants to buy it.\"\n\n\"Are all workers paid at the same rate?\" asked the Doctor.\n\n\"No, but their wages are much nearer equal than in your world.\"\n\n\"You have to hire people to work for you, how do you pay them?\" the\nDoctor inquired.\n\n\"The rate is determined by governmental standard. I pay them by having\nthe amount deducted from my balance and added to theirs.\"\n\n\"When you built this house, how did you go about doing it?\" asked the\nBig Business Man.\n\n\"I simply went to the government, and they built it for me according to\nmy own ideas and wishes, deducting its cost from my balance.\"\n\n\"What about the public work to be done?\" asked the Big Business Man.\n\"Caring for the city streets, the making of roads and all that. Do you\nhave taxes?\"\n\n\"No,\" answered the Chemist smiling, \"we do not have taxes. Quite the\nreverse, we sometimes have dividends.\n\n\"The government, you must understand, not only conducts a business\naccount with each of its citizens, but one with itself also. The value\nof articles produced is computed with a profit allowance, so that by a\nsuccessful business administration, the government is enabled not only\nto meet its public obligations, but to acquire a surplus to its own\ncredit in the form of accumulated merchandise. This surplus is divided\namong the people every five years--a sort of dividend.\"\n\n\"I should think some cities might have much more than others,\" said the\nBig Business Man. \"That would cause discontent, wouldn't it?\"\n\n\"It would probably cause a rush of people to the more successful cities.\nBut it doesn't happen, because each city reports to the National\ngovernment and the whole thing is averaged up. You see it is all quite\nsimple,\" the Chemist finished. \"And it makes life here very easy to\nlive, and very worth the living.\"\n\nUnnoticed by the four interested men, a small compact-looking gray cloud\nhad come sweeping down from the horizon above the lake and was scudding\nacross the sky toward Arite. A sudden sharp crack of thunder interrupted\ntheir conversation.\n\n\"Hello, a storm!\" exclaimed the Chemist, looking out over the lake.\n\"You've never seen one, have you? Come upstairs.\"\n\nThey followed him into the house and upstairs to its flat roof. From\nthis point of vantage they saw that the house was built with an interior\ncourtyard or _patio_. Looking down into this courtyard from the roof\nthey could see a little, splashing fountain in its center, with flower\nbeds, a narrow gray path, and several small white benches.\n\nThe roof, which was guarded with a breast-high parapet around both its\ninner and outer edges, was beautifully laid out with a variety of\nflowers and with trellised flower-bearing vines. In one corner were\ngrowing a number of small trees with great fan-shaped leaves of blue and\nbearing a large bell-shaped silver blossom.\n\nOne end of the roof on the lake side was partially enclosed. Towards\nthis roofed enclosure the Chemist led his friends. Within it a large\nfiber hammock hung between two stone posts. At one side a depression in\nthe floor perhaps eight feet square was filled with what might have been\nblue pine needles, and a fluffy bluish moss. This rustic couch was\ncovered at one end by a canopy of vines bearing a little white flower.\n\nAs they entered the enclosure, it began to rain, and the Chemist slid\nforward several panels, closing them in completely. There were shuttered\nwindows in these walls, through which they could look at the scene\noutside--a scene that with the coming storm was weird and beautiful\nbeyond anything they had ever beheld.\n\nThe cloud had spread sufficiently now to blot out the stars from nearly\nhalf of the sky. It was a thick cloud, absolutely opaque, and yet it\ncaused no appreciable darkness, for the starlight it cut off was\nnegligible and the silver radiation from the lake had more than doubled\nin intensity.\n\nUnder the strong wind that had sprung up the lake assumed now an\nextraordinary aspect. Its surface was raised into long, sweeping waves\nthat curved sharply and broke upon themselves. In their tops the silver\nphosphorescence glowed and whirled until the whole surface of the lake\nseemed filled with a dancing white fire, twisting, turning and seeming\nto leap out of the water high into the air.\n\nSeveral small sailboats, square, flat little catamarans, they looked,\nshowed black against the water as they scudded for shore, trailing lines\nof silver out behind them.\n\nThe wind increased in force. Below, on the beach, a huge rock lay in the\nwater, against which the surf was breaking. Columns of water at times\nshot into the air before the face of the rock, and were blown away by\nthe wind in great clouds of glistening silver. Occasionally it thundered\nwith a very sharp intense crack accompanied by a jagged bolt of bluish\nlightning that zigzagged down from the low-hanging cloud.\n\nThen came the rain in earnest, a solid, heavy torrent, that bent down\nthe wind and smoothed the surface of the lake. The rain fell almost\nvertically, as though it were a tremendous curtain of silver strings.\nAnd each of these strings broke apart into great shining pearls as the\neye followed downward the course of the raindrops.\n\nFor perhaps ten minutes the silver torrent poured down. Then suddenly it\nceased. The wind had died away; in the air there was the fresh warm\nsmell of wet and steaming earth. From the lake rolled up a shimmering\ntranslucent cloud of mist, like an enormous silver fire mounting into\nthe sky. And then, as the gray cloud swept back behind them, beyond the\ncity, and the stars gleamed overhead, they saw again that great trail of\nstar-dust which the Chemist first had seen through his microscope,\nhanging in an ever broadening arc across the sky, and ending vaguely at\ntheir feet.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nTHE TRIAL\n\n\nIn a few moments more the storm had passed completely; only the wet city\nstreets, the mist over the lake, and the moist warmth of the air\nremained. For some time the three visitors to this extraordinary world\nstood silent at the latticed windows, awed by what they had seen. The\nnoise of the panels as the Chemist slid them back brought them to\nthemselves.\n\n\"A curious land, gentlemen,\" he remarked quietly.\n\n\"It's--it's weird,\" the Very Young Man ejaculated.\n\nThe Chemist led them out across the roof to its other side facing the\ncity. The street upon which the house stood sloped upwards over the hill\nbehind. It was wet with the rain and gleamed like a sheet of burnished\nsilver. And down its sides now ran two little streams of liquid silver\nfire.\n\nThe street, deserted during the storm, was beginning to fill again with\npeople returning to their tasks. At the intersection with the next road\nabove, they could see a line of sleighs passing. Beneath them, before\nthe wall of the garden a little group of men stood talking; on a\nroof-top nearby a woman appeared with a tiny naked infant which she sat\ndown to nurse in a corner of her garden.\n\n\"A city at work,\" said the Chemist with a wave of his hand. \"Shall we go\ndown and see it?\"\n\nHis three friends assented readily, the Very Young Man suggesting\npromptly that they first visit Lylda's father and Aura.\n\n\"He is teaching Loto this morning,\" said the Chemist smiling.\n\n\"Why not go to the court?\" suggested the Big Business Man.\n\n\"Is the public admitted?\" asked the Doctor.\n\n\"Nothing is secret here,\" the Chemist answered. \"By all means, we will\ngo to the court first, if you wish; Lylda should be through very\nshortly.\"\n\nThe court of Arite stood about a mile away near the lake shore. As they\nleft the house and passed through the city streets the respect accorded\nthe Chemist became increasingly apparent. The three strangers with him\nattracted considerable attention, for, although they wore the\nconventional robes in which the more prominent citizens were generally\nattired, their short hair and the pallid whiteness of their skins made\nthem objects of curiosity. No crowd gathered; those they passed stared a\nlittle, raised their hands to their foreheads and went their way, yet\nunderneath these signs of respect there was with some an air of\nsullenness, of hostility, that the visitors could not fail to notice.\n\nThe Oroid men, in street garb, were dressed generally in a short\nmetallic-looking tunic of drab, with a brighter-colored girdle. The\nwomen, most of them, wore only a sort of skirt, reaching from waist to\nknees; a few had circular discs covering their breasts. There were\nhardly any children to be seen, except occasionally a little face\nstaring at them from a window, or peering down from a roof-top. Once or\ntwice they passed a woman with an infant slung across her back in a sort\nof hammock.\n\nThe most common vehicle was the curious form of sleigh in which they had\nridden down through the tunnels. They saw also a few little two-wheeled\ncarts, with wheels that appeared to be a solid segment of tree-trunk.\nAll the vehicles were drawn by meek-looking little gray animals like a\nsmall deer without horns.\n\nThe court-house of Arite, though a larger building, from the outside was\nhardly different than most others in the city. It was distinct, however,\nin having on either side of the broad doorway that served as its main\nentrance, a large square stone column.\n\nAs they entered, passing a guard who saluted them respectfully, the\nvisitors turned from a hallway and ascended a flight of steps. At the\ntop they found themselves on a balcony overlooking the one large room\nthat occupied almost the entire building. The balcony ran around all\nthree sides (the room was triangular in shape) and was railed with a low\nstone parapet. On it were perhaps fifty people, sitting quietly on stone\nbenches that lay close up behind the parapet. An attendant stood at each\nof the corners of the balcony; the one nearest bowed low as the Chemist\nand his companions entered silently and took their seats.\n\nFrom the balcony the entire room below was in plain view. At the apex of\nits triangle sat the judge, on a raised dais of white stone with a\ngolden canopy over it. He was a man about fifty--this leader of the\ncourt--garbed in a long loose robe of white. His hair, that fell on his\nshoulders, was snowy white, and around his forehead was a narrow white\nband. He held in his hand a sort of scepter of gold with a heavy golden\ntriangle at its end.\n\nIn six raised tiers of unequal length, like a triangular flight of\nstairs across the angle of the room, and directly in front of the judge,\nwas the jury--twenty men and twenty women, seated in alternate rows. The\nmen wore loose robes of gray; the women robes of blue. On a seat raised\nslightly above the others sat a man who evidently was speaker for the\nmen of the jury. On a similar elevated seat was the woman speaker; this\nlatter was Lylda.\n\nNear the center of the room, facing the judge and jury were two\ntriangular spaces about twenty feet across, enclosed with a breast-high\nwall of stone. Within each of these enclosures were perhaps ten or\ntwelve people seated on small stone benches. Directly facing the members\nof the jury and between them and the two enclosures, was a small\nplatform raised about four feet above the floor, with several steps\nleading up to it from behind.\n\nA number of attendants dressed in the characteristic short tunics, with\nbreastplates and a short sword hanging from the waist, stood near the\nenclosures, and along the sides of the room.\n\nThe Chemist leaned over and whispered to his friends: \"Those two\nenclosed places in the center are for the witnesses. Over there are\nthose testifying for the accused; the others are witnesses for the\ngovernment. The platform is where the accused stands when----\"\n\nHe broke off suddenly. An expectant hush seemed to run over the room. A\ndoor at the side opened, and preceded and followed by two attendants a\nman entered, who walked slowly across the floor and stood alone upon the\nraised platform facing the jury.\n\nHe was a man of extraordinarily striking look and demeanor. He stood\nconsiderably over six feet in height, with a remarkably powerful yet\nlean body. He was naked except for a cloth breech clout girdled about\nhis loins. His appearance was not that of an Oroid, for beside his\ngreater height, and more muscular physique, his skin was distinctly of a\nmore brownish hue. His hair was cut at the base of the neck in Oroid\nfashion; it was black, with streaks of silver running through it. His\nfeatures were large and cast in a rugged mold. His mouth was cruel, and\nwore now a sardonic smile. He stood erect with head thrown back and arms\nfolded across his breast, calmly facing the men and women who were to\njudge him.\n\nThe Very Young Man gripped the Chemist by the arm. \"Who is that?\" he\nwhispered.\n\nThe Chemist's lips were pressed together; he seemed deeply affected. \"I\ndid not know they caught him,\" he answered softly. \"It must have been\njust this morning.\"\n\nThe Very Young Man looked at Lylda. Her face was placid, but her breast\nwas rising and falling more rapidly than normal, and her hands in her\nlap were tightly clenched.\n\nThe judge began speaking quietly, amid a deathlike silence. For over\nfive minutes he spoke; once he was interrupted by a cheer, instantly\nstifled, and once by a murmur of dissent from several spectators on the\nbalcony that called forth instant rebuke from the attendant stationed\nthere.\n\nThe judge finished his speech, and raised his golden scepter slowly\nbefore him. As his voice died away, Lylda rose to her feet and facing\nthe judge bowed low, with hands to her forehead. Then she spoke a few\nwords, evidently addressing the women before her. Each of them raised\nher hands and answered in a monosyllable, as though affirming an oath.\nThis performance was repeated by the men.\n\nThe accused still stood silent, smiling sardonically. Suddenly his voice\nrasped out with a short, ugly intonation and he threw his arms straight\nout before him. A murmur rose from the spectators, and several\nattendants leaned forward towards the platform. But the man only looked\naround at them contemptuously and again folded his arms.\n\nFrom one of the enclosures a woman came, and mounted the platform beside\nthe man. The Chemist whispered, \"His wife; she is going to speak for\nhim.\" But with a muttered exclamation and wave of his arm, the man swept\nher back, and without a word she descended the steps and reentered the\nrailed enclosure.\n\nThen the man turned and raising his arms spoke angrily to those seated\nin the enclosure. Then he appealed to the judge.\n\nThe Chemist whispered in explanation: \"He refuses any witnesses.\"\n\nAt a sign from the judge the enclosure was opened and its occupants left\nthe floor, most of them taking seats upon the balcony.\n\n\"Who is he?\" the Very Young Man wanted to know, but the Chemist ignored\nhis question.\n\nFor perhaps ten minutes the man spoke, obviously in his own defence. His\nvoice was deep and powerful, yet he spoke now seemingly without anger;\nand without an air of pleading. In fact his whole attitude seemed one of\nirony and defiance. Abruptly he stopped speaking and silence again fell\nover the room. A man and a woman left the other enclosure and mounted\nthe platform beside the accused. They seemed very small and fragile, as\nhe towered over them, looking down at them sneeringly.\n\nThe man and woman conferred a moment in whispers. Then the woman spoke.\nShe talked only a few minutes, interrupted twice by the judge, once by a\nquestion from Lylda, and once by the accused himself.\n\nThen for perhaps ten minutes more her companion addressed the court. He\nwas a man considerably over middle age, and evidently, from his dress\nand bearing, a man of prominence in the nation. At one point in his\nspeech it became obvious that his meaning was not clearly understood by\nthe jury. Several of the women whispered together, and one rose and\nspoke to Lylda. She interrupted the witness with a quiet question. Later\nthe accused himself questioned the speaker until silenced by the judge.\n\nFollowing this witness came two others. Then the judge rose, and looking\nup to the balcony where the Chemist and his companions were sitting,\nmotioned to the Chemist to descend to the floor below.\n\nThe Very Young Man tried once again with his whispered question \"What is\nit?\" but the Chemist only smiled, and rising quietly left them.\n\nThere was a stir in the court-room as the Chemist crossed the main\nfloor. He did not ascend the platform with the prisoner, but stood\nbeside it. He spoke to the jury quietly, yet with a suppressed power in\nhis voice that must have been convincing. He spoke only a moment, more\nwith the impartial attitude of one who gives advice than as a witness.\nWhen he finished, he bowed to the court and left the floor, returning at\nonce to his friends upon the balcony.\n\nFollowing the Chemist, after a moment of silence, the judge briefly\naddressed the prisoner, who stolidly maintained his attitude of ironic\ndefiance.\n\n\"He is going to ask the jury to give its verdict now,\" said the Chemist\nin a low voice.\n\nLylda and her companion leader rose and faced their subordinates, and\nwith a verbal monosyllable from each member of the jury the verdict was\nunhesitatingly given. As the last juryman's voice died away, there came\na cry from the back of the room, a woman tore herself loose from the\nattendants holding her, and running swiftly across the room leaped upon\nthe platform. She was a slight little woman, almost a child in\nappearance beside the man's gigantic stature. She stood looking at him a\nmoment with heaving breast and great sorrowful eyes from which the tears\nwere welling out and flowing down her cheeks unheeded.\n\nThe man's face softened. He put his hands gently upon the sides of her\nneck. Then, as she began sobbing, he folded her in his great arms. For\nan instant she clung to him. Then he pushed her away. Still crying\nsoftly, she descended from the platform, and walked slowly back across\nthe room.\n\nHardly had she disappeared when there arose from the street outside a\nfaint, confused murmur, as of an angry crowd gathering. The judge had\nleft his seat now and the jury was filing out of the room.\n\nThe Chemist turned to his friends. \"Shall we go?\" he asked.\n\n\"This trial--\" began the Big Business Man. \"You haven't told us its\nsignificance. This man--good God what a figure of power and hate and\nevil. Who is he?\"\n\n\"It must have been evident to you, gentlemen,\" the Chemist said quietly,\n\"that you have been witnessing an event of the utmost importance to us\nall. I have to tell you of the crisis facing us; this trial is its\nlatest development. That man--\"\n\nThe insistent murmur from the street grew louder. Shouts arose and then\na loud pounding from the side of the building.\n\nThe Chemist broke off abruptly and rose to his feet. \"Come outside,\" he\nsaid.\n\nThey followed him through a doorway on to a balcony, overlooking the\nstreet. Gathered before the court-house was a crowd of several hundred\nmen and women. They surged up against its entrance angrily, and were\nheld in check there by the armed attendants on guard. A smaller crowd\nwas pounding violently upon a side door of the building. Several people\nran shouting down the street, spreading the excitement through the city.\n\nThe Chemist and his companions stood in the doorway of the balcony an\ninstant, silently regarding this ominous scene. The Chemist was just\nabout to step forward, when, upon another balcony, nearer the corner of\nthe building a woman appeared. She stepped close to the edge of the\nparapet and raised her arms commandingly.\n\nIt was Lylda. She had laid aside her court robe and stood now in her\nglistening silver tunic. Her hair was uncoiled, and fell in dark masses\nover her white shoulders, blowing out behind her in the wind.\n\nThe crowd hesitated at the sight of her, and quieted a little. She stood\nrigid as a statue for a moment, holding her arms outstretched. Then,\ndropping them with a gesture of appeal she began to speak.\n\nAt the sound of her voice, clear and vibrant, yet soft, gentle and\nwomanly, there came silence from below, and after a moment every face\nwas upturned to hers. Gradually her voice rose in pitch. Its gentle tone\nwas gone now--it became forceful, commanding. Then again she flung out\nher arms with a dramatic gesture and stood rigid, every line of her body\ndenoting power--almost imperious command. Abruptly she ceased speaking,\nand, as she stood motionless, slowly at first, the crowd silently\ndispersed.\n\nThe street below was soon clear. Even those onlookers at a distance\nturned the corner and disappeared. Another moment passed, and then Lylda\nswayed and sank upon the floor of the balcony, with her head on her arms\nagainst its low stone railing--just a tired, gentle, frightened little\nwoman.\n\n\"She did it--how wonderfully she did it,\" the Very Young Man murmured in\nadmiration.\n\n\"We can handle them now,\" answered the Chemist. \"But each time--it is\nharder. Let us get Lylda and go home, gentlemen. I want to tell you all\nabout it.\" He turned to leave the balcony.\n\n\"Who was the man? What was he tried for?\" the Very Young Man demanded.\n\n\"That trial was the first of its kind ever held,\" the Chemist answered.\n\"The man was condemned to death. It was a new crime--the gravest we have\never had to face--the crime of treason.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nLYLDA'S PLAN\n\n\nBack home, comfortably seated upon the broad balcony overlooking the\nlake, the three men sat waiting to hear their host's explanation of the\nstrange events they had witnessed. Lylda busied herself preparing a\nlight noonday meal, which she served charmingly on the balcony while\nthey talked.\n\n\"My friends,\" the Chemist began. \"I tried to give you this morning, a\npicture of this world and the life I have been leading here. I think you\nunderstand, although I did not specifically say so, that all I said\nrelated to the time when I first came here. That you would call this\nlife Utopia, because of the way I outlined it, I do not doubt; or at\nleast you would call it a state of affairs as near Utopian as any human\nbeings can approach.\n\n\"All that is true; it was Utopia. But gentlemen, it is so no longer.\nThings have been changing of recent years, until now--well you saw what\nhappened this morning.\n\n\"I cannot account for the first cause of this trouble. Perhaps the\nMalite war, with its disillusionment to our people--I do not know. Faith\nin human kindness was broken: the Oroids could no longer trust\nimplicitly in each other. A gradual distrust arose--a growing unrest--a\ndissatisfaction, which made no demands at first, nor seemed indeed to\nhave any definite grievances of any sort. From it there sprang leaders,\nwho by their greater intelligence created desires that fed and nourished\ntheir dissatisfaction--gave it a seemingly tangible goal that made it\nfar more dangerous than it ever had been before.\n\n\"About a year ago there first came into prominence the man whom you saw\nthis morning condemned to death. His name is Targo--he is a\nMalite--full-blooded I believe, although he says not. For twenty years\nor more he has lived in Orlog, a city some fifty miles from Arite. His\nwife is an Oroid.\n\n\"Targo, by his eloquence, and the power and force of his personality,\nwon a large following in Orlog, and to a lesser degree in many other\ncities. Twice, some months ago, he was arrested and reprimanded; the\nlast time with a warning that a third offence would mean his death.\"\n\n\"What is he after?\" asked the Very Young Man.\n\n\"The Targos, as they are called, demand principally a different division\nof the land. Under the present system, approximately one-third of all\nthe land is in the hands of the government. Of that, generally more than\nhalf lies idle most of the time. The Targos wish to have this land\ndivided among the citizens. They claim also that most of the city\norganizations do not produce as large a dividend as the Targos could\nshow under their own management. They have many other grievances that\nthere is no reason for me to detail.\"\n\n\"Why not let them try out their theories in some city?\" suggested the\nBig Business Man.\n\n\"They are trying them,\" the Chemist answered. \"There was a revolution in\nOrlog about six months ago. Several of its officials were\nassassinated--almost the first murders we have ever had. The Targos took\npossession of the government--a brother of this man you saw this morning\nbecame leader of the city. Orlog withdrew from the Oroid government and\nis now handling its affairs as a separate nation.\"\n\n\"I wonder----\" began the Big Business Man thoughtfully. \"Well, why not\nlet them run it that way, if they want to?\"\n\n\"No reason, if they were sincere. But they are not sincere nor honest\nfundamentally. Their leaders are for the most part Malites, or Oroids\nwith Malite blood. And they are fooling the people. Their followers are\nall the more unintelligent, more gullible individuals, or those in whom\nthere lies a latent criminal streak.\n\n\"The thing doesn't work. Sexual license is growing in Orlog. Crimes\nagainst women are becoming more and more frequent. Offences committed by\nthose prominent, or in authority, go unpunished. Women's testimony is\ndiscredited, often by concerted lying on the part of men witnesses.\n\n\"Many families are leaving Orlog--leaving their land and their homes\ndeserted. In other cities where the Targos threaten to gain control the\nsame thing is happening. Most of these refugees come to Arite. We cannot\ntake care of them; there is not enough land here.\"\n\n\"Why not take your army and clean them up?\" suggested the Very Young\nMan.\n\nThey were seated around a little table, at which Lylda was serving\nlunch. At the question she stopped in the act of pouring a steaming\nliquid from a little metal kettle into their dainty golden drinking cups\nand looked at the Very Young Man gravely.\n\n\"Very easy it would be to do that perhaps,\" she said quietly. \"But these\nTargos, except a few--they are our own people. And they too are armed.\nWe cannot fight them; we cannot kill them--our own people.\"\n\n\"We may have to,\" said the Chemist. \"But you see, I did not realize, I\ncould not believe the extent to which this Targo could sway the people.\nNor did I at first realize what evils would result if his ideas were\ncarried out. He has many followers right here in Arite. You saw that\nthis morning.\"\n\n\"How did you catch him?\" interrupted the Very Young Man.\n\n\"Yesterday he came to Arite,\" said Lylda. \"He came to speak. With him\ncame fifty others. With them too came his wife to speak here, to our\nwomen. He thought we would do nothing; he defied us. There was a\nfight--this morning--and many were killed. And we brought him to the\ncourt--you saw.\"\n\n\"It is a serious situation,\" said the Doctor. \"I had no idea----\"\n\n\"We can handle it--we must handle it,\" said the Chemist. \"But as Lylda\nsays, we cannot kill our own people--only as a last desperate measure.\"\n\n\"Suppose you wait too long,\" suggested the Big Business Man. \"You say\nthese Targos are gaining strength every day. You might have a very bad\ncivil war.\"\n\n\"That was the problem,\" answered the Chemist.\n\n\"But now you come,\" said Lylda. \"You change it all when you come down to\nus out of the great beyond. Our people, they call you genii of the\nMaster, they----\"\n\n\"Oh gee, I never thought of that,\" murmured the Very Young Man. \"What\n_do_ you think of us?\"\n\n\"They think you are supernatural beings of course,\" the Chemist said\nsmiling. \"Yet they accept you without fear and they look to you and to\nme for help.\"\n\n\"This morning, there at the court,\" said Lylda, \"I heard them say that\nTargo spoke against you. Devils, he said, from the Great Blue Star, come\nhere with evil for us all. And they believe him, some of them. It was\nfor that perhaps they acted as they did before the court. In Arite now,\nmany believe in Targo. And it is bad, very bad.\"\n\n\"The truth is,\" added the Chemist, \"your coming, while it gives us\nunlimited possibilities for commanding the course of events, at the same\ntime has precipitated the crisis. Naturally no one can understand who or\nwhat you are. And as Lylda says, the Targos undoubtedly are telling the\npeople you come to ally yourself with me for evil. There will be\nthousands who will listen to them and fear and hate you--especially in\nsome of the other cities.\"\n\n\"What does the king say?\" asked the Doctor.\n\n\"We will see him to-morrow. He has been anxiously waiting for you. But\nyou must not forget,\" the Chemist added with a smile, \"the king has had\nlittle experience facing strife or evil-doing of any kind. It was almost\nunknown until recently. It is I, and you, gentlemen, who are facing the\nproblem of saving this nation.\"\n\nThe Very Young Man's face was flushed, and his eyes sparkled with\nexcitement. \"We can do anything we like,\" he said. \"We have the power.\"\n\n\"Ay, that is it,\" said Lylda. \"The power we have. But my friend, we\ncannot use it. Not for strife, for death; we cannot.\"\n\n\"The execution of Targo will cause more trouble,\" said the Chemist\nthoughtfully. \"It is bound to make----\"\n\n\"When will you put him to death?\" asked the Big Business Man.\n\n\"To-morrow he dies,\" Lylda answered. \"To-morrow, before the time of\nsleep.\"\n\n\"There will be trouble,\" said the Chemist again. \"We are in no personal\ndanger of course, but, for the people who now believe in Targo, I am\nafraid----\"\n\n\"A plan I have made,\" said Lylda. She sat forward tensely in her chair,\nbrushing her hair back from her face with a swift gesture. \"A plan I\nhave made. It is the only way--I now think--that may be there comes no\nharm to our people. It is that we want to do, if we can.\" She spoke\neagerly, and without waiting for them to answer, went swiftly on.\n\n\"This drug that you have brought, I shall take it. And I shall get big.\nOh, not so very big, but big enough to be the height of a man it may be\nten times. Then shall I talk to the people--I, Lylda--woman of the\nMaster, and then shall I tell them that this power, this magic, is for\ngood, not for evil, if only they will give up Targo and all who are with\nhim.\"\n\n\"I will take it with you,\" said the Chemist. \"Together we----\"\n\n\"No, no, my husband. Alone I must do this. Ah, do you not know they say\nthese stranger devils with their magic come for evil? And you too, must\nyou not forget, once were a stranger just as they. That the people\nknow--that they remember.\n\n\"But I--I--Lylda--a woman of the Oroids I am--full-blooded Oroid, no\nstranger. And they will believe me--a woman--for they know I cannot lie.\n\n\"I shall tell them I am for good, for kindness, for all we had, that\ntime before the Malite war, when every one was happy. And if they will\nnot believe, if as I say they will not do, then shall my power be indeed\nfor evil, and all who will obey me not shall die. But they will\nbelieve--no need will there be to threaten.\n\n\"To many cities I will go. And in them, all of those who want to live by\nTargo's law will I send to Orlog. And all in Orlog who believe him not,\nwill I tell to leave, and to the other cities go to make their homes.\nThen Orlog shall be Targo's city. And to-morrow he will not die, but go\nthere into Orlog and become their king. For I shall say it may be there\nare some who like his rule of evil. Or it may be he is good in different\nfashion, and in time can make us see that his law too, is just and kind.\n\n\"Then shall live in Orlog all who wish to stay, and we shall watch their\nrule, but never shall we let them pass beyond their borders. For if they\ndo, then shall we kill them.\n\n\"All this I can do, my husband, if you but will let me try. For me they\nwill believe, a woman, Oroid all of blood--for they know women do not\nlie.\" She stopped and the fire in her eyes changed to a look of gentle\npleading. \"If you will but let me try,\" she finished. \"My\nhusband--please.\"\n\nThe Chemist glanced at his friends who sat astonished by this flow of\neager, impassioned words. Then he turned again to Lylda's intent,\npleading face, regarding her tenderly. \"You are very fine, little mother\nof my son,\" he said gently, lapsing for a moment into her own style of\nspeech. \"It could do no harm,\" he added thoughtfully \"and perhaps----\"\n\n\"Let her try it,\" said the Doctor. \"No harm could come to her.\"\n\n\"No harm to me could come,\" said Lylda quickly. \"And I shall make them\nbelieve. I can, because I am a woman, and they will know I tell the\ntruth. Ah, you will let me try, my husband--please?\"\n\nThe Chemist appealed to the others. \"They will believe her, many of\nthem,\" he said. \"They will leave Orlog as she directs. But those in\nother cities will still hold to Targo, they will simply remain silent\nfor a time. What their feelings will be or are we cannot tell. Some will\nleave and go to Orlog of course, for Lylda will offer freedom of their\nleader and to secure that they will seem to agree to anything.\n\n\"But after all, they are nothing but children at heart, most of them.\nTo-day, they might believe in Lylda; to-morrow Targo could win them\nagain.\"\n\n\"He won't get a chance,\" put in the Very Young Man quickly. \"If she says\nwe kill anybody who talks for Targo outside of Orlog, that goes. It's\nthe only way, isn't it?\"\n\n\"And she might really convince them--or most of them,\" added the Doctor.\n\n\"You will let me try?\" asked Lylda softly. The Chemist nodded.\n\nLylda sprang to her feet. Her frail little body was trembling with\nemotion; on her face was a look almost of exaltation.\n\n\"You _will_ let me try,\" she cried. \"Then I shall make them believe.\nHere, now, this very hour, I shall make them know the truth. And they,\nmy own people, shall I save from sorrow, misery and death.\"\n\nShe turned to the Chemist and spoke rapidly.\n\n\"My husband, will you send Oteo now, up into the city. Him will you tell\nto have others spread the news. All who desire an end to Targo's rule,\nshall come here at once. And all too, who in him believe, and who for\nhim want freedom, they shall come too. Let Oteo tell them magic shall be\nperformed and Lylda will speak with them.\n\n\"Make haste, my husband, for now I go to change my dress. Not as the\nMaster's woman will I speak, but as Lylda--Oroid woman--woman of the\npeople.\" And with a flashing glance, she turned and swiftly left the\nbalcony.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nLYLDA ACTS\n\n\n\"She'll do it,\" the Very Young Man murmured, staring at the doorway\nthrough which Lylda had disappeared. \"She can do anything.\"\n\nThe Chemist rose to his feet. \"I'll send Oteo. Will you wait here\ngentlemen? And will you have some of the drugs ready for Lylda? You have\nthem with you?\" The men nodded.\n\n\"How about Lylda carrying the drugs?\" asked the Very Young Man. \"And\nwhat about her clothes?\"\n\n\"I have already made a belt for Lylda and for myself--some time ago,\"\nthe Chemist answered. \"During the first year I was here I made several\nexperiments with the drugs. I found that almost anything within the\nimmediate--shall I say influence of the body, will contract with it.\nAlmost any garment, even a loose robe will change size. You found that\nto be so to some extent. Those belts you wore down--\"\n\n\"That's true,\" agreed the Doctor, \"there seems to be considerable\nlatitude----\"\n\n\"I decided,\" the Chemist went on, \"that immediately after your arrival\nwe should all wear the drugs constantly. You can use the armpit pouches\nif you wish; Lylda and I will wear these belts I have made.\"\n\nOteo, the Chemist's personal servant, a slim youth with a bright,\nintelligent face, listened carefully to his master's directions and then\nleft the house hurriedly, running up the street towards the center of\nthe city. Once or twice he stopped and spoke to passers-by for a moment,\ngathering a crowd around him each time.\n\nThe Chemist rejoined his friends on the balcony. \"There will be a\nthousand people here in half an hour,\" he said quietly. \"I have sent a\nmessage to the men in charge of the government workshops; they will have\ntheir people cease work to come here.\"\n\nLylda appeared in a few moments more. She was dressed as the Chemist had\nseen her first through the microscope--in a short, grey skirt reaching\nfrom waist to knees. Only now she wore also two circular metal discs\nstrapped over her breasts. Her hair was unbound and fell in masses\nforward over her shoulders. Around her waist was a broad girdle of\ngolden cloth with small pouches for holding the chemicals. She took her\nplace among the men quietly.\n\n\"See, I am ready,\" she said with a smile. \"Oteo, you have sent him?\" The\nChemist nodded.\n\nLylda turned to the Doctor. \"You will tell me, what is to do with the\ndrugs?\"\n\nThey explained in a few words. By now a considerable crowd had gathered\nbefore the house, and up the street many others were hurrying down.\nDirectly across from the entrance to Lylda's garden, back of the bluff\nat the lake front, was a large open space with a fringe of trees at its\nback. In this open space the crowd was collecting.\n\nThe Chemist rose after a moment and from the roof-top spoke a few words\nto the people in the street below. They answered him with shouts of\napplause mingled with a hum of murmured anger underneath. The Chemist\nwent back to his friends, his face set and serious.\n\nAs he dropped in his chair Lylda knelt on the floor before him, laying\nher arms on his knees. \"I go to do for our people the best I can,\" she\nsaid softly, looking up into his face. \"Now I go, but to you I will come\nback soon.\" The Chemist tenderly put his hand upon the glossy smoothness\nof her hair.\n\n\"I go--now,\" she repeated, and reached for one of the vials under her\narm. Holding it in her hand, she stared at it a moment, silently, in\nawe. Then she shuddered like a frightened child and buried her face in\nthe Chemist's lap, huddling her little body up close against his legs as\nif for protection.\n\nThe Chemist did not move nor speak, but sat quiet with his hand gently\nstroking her hair. In a moment she again raised her face to his. Her\nlong lashes were wet with tears, but her lips were smiling.\n\n\"I am ready--now,\" she said gently. She brushed her tears from her eyes\nand rose to her feet. Drawing herself to her full height, she tossed\nback her head and flung out her arms before her.\n\n\"No one can know I am afraid--but you,\" she said. \"And I--shall forget.\"\nShe dropped her arms and stood passive.\n\n\"I go now to take the drug--there in the little garden behind, where no\none can notice. You will come down?\"\n\nThe Big Business Man cleared his throat. When he spoke his voice was\ntremulous with emotion.\n\n\"How long will you be gone--Lylda?\" he asked.\n\nThe woman turned to him with a smile. \"Soon will I return, so I\nbelieve,\" she answered. \"I go to Orlog, to Raito, and to Tele. But never\nshall I wait, nor speak long, and fast will I walk.... Before the time\nof sleep has descended upon us, I shall be here.\"\n\nIn the little garden behind the house, out of sight of the crowd on the\nother side, Lylda prepared to take the drug. She was standing there,\nwith the four men, when Loto burst upon them, throwing himself into his\nmother's arms.\n\n\"Oh, _mamita_, _mamita_,\" he cried, clinging to her. \"There in the\nstreet outside, they say such terrible things----of you _mamita_. 'The\nmaster's woman' I heard one say, 'She has the evil magic.' And another\nspoke of Targo. And they say he must not die, or there will be death for\nthose who kill him.\"\n\nLylda held the boy close as he poured out his breathless frightened\nwords.\n\n\"No matter, little son,\" she said tenderly. \"To _mamita_ no harm can\ncome--you shall see. Did my father teach you well to-day?\"\n\n\"But _mamita_, one man who saw me standing, called me an evil name and\nspoke of you, my mother Lylda. And a woman looked with a look I never\nsaw before. I am afraid, _mamita_.\"\n\nWith quivering lips that smiled, Lylda kissed the little boy tenderly\nand gently loosening his hold pushed him towards his father.\n\n\"The Master's son, Loto, never can he be afraid,\" she said with gentle\nreproof. \"That must you remember--always.\"\n\nThe little group in the garden close up against the house stood silent\nas Lylda took a few grains of the drug. The noise and shouts of the\ncrowd in front were now plainly audible. One voice was raised above the\nothers, as though someone were making a speech.\n\nLoto stood beside his father, and the Chemist laid his arm across the\nboy's shoulder. As Lylda began visibly to increase in size, the boy\nuttered a startled cry. Meeting his mother's steady gaze he shut his\nlips tight, and stood rigid, watching her with wide, horrified eyes.\n\nLylda had grown nearly twice her normal size before she spoke. Then,\nsmiling down at the men, she said evenly, \"From the roof, perhaps, you\nwill watch.\"\n\n\"You know what to do if you grow too large,\" the Doctor said huskily.\n\n\"I know, my friend. I thank you all. And good-bye.\" She met the\nChemist's glance an instant. Then abruptly she faced about and walking\nclose to the house, stood at its further corner facing the lake.\n\nAfter a moment's hesitation the Chemist led his friends to the roof. As\nthey appeared at the edge of the parapet a great shout rolled up from\nthe crowd below. Nearly a thousand people had gathered. The street was\ncrowded and in the open space beyond they stood in little groups. On a\nslight eminence near the lake bluff, a man stood haranguing those around\nhim. He was a short, very thickset little man, with very long arms--a\nsquat, apelike figure. He talked loudly and indignantly; around him\nperhaps a hundred people stood listening, applauding at intervals.\n\nWhen the Chemist appeared this man stopped with a final phrase of\nvituperation and a wave of his fist towards the house.\n\nThe Chemist stood silent, looking out over the throng. \"How large is she\nnow?\" he asked the Very Young Man softly. The Very Young Man ran across\nthe roof to its farther corner and was back in an instant.\n\n\"They'll see her soon--look there.\" His friends turned at his words. At\nthe corner of the house they could just see the top of Lylda's head\nabove the edge of the parapet. As they watched she grew still taller and\nin another moment her forehead appeared. She turned her head, and her\ngreat eyes smiled softly at them across the roof-top. In a few moments\nmore (she had evidently stopped growing) with a farewell glance at her\nhusband, she stepped around the corner of the house into full view of\nthe crowd--a woman over sixty feet tall, standing quietly in the garden\nwith one hand resting upon the roof of the house behind her.\n\nA cry of terror rose from the people as she appeared. Most of those in\nthe street ran in fright back into the field behind. Then, seeing her\nstanding motionless with a gentle smile on her face, they stopped,\nirresolute. A few held their ground, frankly curious and unafraid.\nOthers stood sullen and defiant.\n\nWhen the people had quieted a little Lylda raised her arms in greeting\nand spoke, softly, yet with a voice that carried far away over the\nfield. As she talked the people seemed to recover their composure\nrapidly. Her tremendous size no longer seemed to horrify them. Those who\nobviously at first were friendly appeared now quite at ease; the others,\nwith their lessening terror, were visibly more hostile.\n\nOnce Lylda mentioned the name of Targo. A scattered shout came up from\nthe crowd; the apelike man shouted out something to those near him, and\nthen, leaving his knoll disappeared.\n\nAs Lylda continued, the hostile element in the crowd grew more\ninsistent. They did not listen to her now but shouted back, in derision\nand defiance. Then suddenly a stone was thrown; it struck Lylda on the\nbreast, hitting her metal breastplate with a thud and dropping at her\nfeet.\n\nAs though at a signal a hail of stones flew up from the crowd, most of\nthem striking Lylda like tiny pebbles, a few of the larger ones bounding\nagainst the house, or landing on its roof.\n\nAt this attack Lylda abruptly stopped speaking and took a step forward\nmenacingly. The hail of stones continued. Then she turned towards the\nroof-top, where the men and the little boy stood behind the parapet,\nsheltering themselves from the flying stones.\n\n\"Only one way there is,\" said Lylda sadly, in a soft whisper that they\nplainly heard above the noise of the crowd. \"I am sorry, my husband--but\nI must.\"\n\nA stone struck her shoulder. She faced the crowd again; a gentle look of\nsorrow was in her eyes, but her mouth was stern. In the street below at\nthe edge of the field the squat little man had reappeared. It was from\nhere that most of the stones seemed to come.\n\n\"That man there--by the road----\" The Chemist pointed. \"One of\nTargo's----\"\n\nIn three swift steps Lylda was across the garden, with one foot over the\nwall into the street. Reaching down she caught the man between her huge\nfingers, and held him high over her head an instant so that all might\nsee.\n\nThe big crowd was silent with terror; the man high in the air over their\nheads screamed horribly. Lylda hesitated only a moment more; then she\nthrew back her arm and, with a great great sweep, flung her screaming\nvictim far out into the lake.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nTHE ESCAPE OF TARGO\n\n\n\"I am very much afraid it was a wrong move,\" said the Chemist gravely.\n\nThey were sitting in a corner of the roof, talking over the situation.\nLylda had left the city; the last they had seen of her, she was striding\nrapidly away, over the country towards Orlog. The street and field\nbefore the house now was nearly deserted.\n\n\"She had to do it, of course,\" the Chemist continued, \"but to kill\nTargo's brother----\"\n\n\"I wonder,\" began the Big Business Man thoughtfully. \"It seems to me\nthis disturbance is becoming far more serious than we think. It isn't so\nmuch a political issue now between your government and the followers of\nTargo, as it is a struggle against those of us who have this magic, as\nthey call it.\"\n\n\"That's just the point,\" put in the Doctor quickly. \"They are making the\npeople believe that our power of changing size is a menace that----\"\n\n\"If I had only realized,\" said the Chemist. \"I thought your coming would\nhelp. Apparently it was the very worst thing that could have happened.\"\n\n\"Not for you personally,\" interjected the Very Young Man. \"We're\nperfectly safe--and Lylda, and Loto.\" He put his arm affectionately\naround the boy who sat close beside him. \"You are not afraid, are you,\nLoto?\"\n\n\"Now I am not,\" answered the boy seriously. \"But this morning, when I\nleft my grandfather, coming home----\"\n\n\"You were afraid for your mother. That was it, wasn't it?\" finished the\nVery Young Man. \"Does your grandfather teach you?\"\n\n\"Yes--he, and father, and mother.\"\n\n\"I want you to see Lylda's father,\" said the Chemist. \"There is nothing\nwe can do now until Lylda returns. Shall we walk up there?\" They all\nagreed readily.\n\n\"I may go, too?\" Loto asked, looking at his father.\n\n\"You have your lessons,\" said the Chemist.\n\n\"But, my father, it is so very lonely without mother,\" protested the\nboy.\n\nThe Chemist smiled gently. \"Afraid, little son, to stay with Oteo?\"\n\n\"He's not afraid,\" said the Very Young Man stoutly.\n\nThe little boy looked from one to the other of them a moment silently.\nThen, calling Oteo's name, he ran across the roof and down into the\nhouse.\n\n\"Five years ago,\" said the Chemist, as the child disappeared, \"there was\nhardly such an emotion in this world as fear or hate or anger. Now the\npendulum is swinging to the other extreme. I suppose that's natural,\nbut----\" He ended with a sigh, and, breaking his train of thought, rose\nto his feet. \"Shall we start?\"\n\nLylda's father greeted them gravely, with a dignity, and yet obvious\ncordiality that was quite in accord with his appearance. He was a man\nover sixty. His still luxuriant white hair fell to his shoulders. His\nface was hairless, for in this land all men's faces were as devoid of\nhair as those of the women. He was dressed in a long, flowing robe\nsimilar to those his visitors were wearing.\n\n\"Because--you come--I am glad,\" he said with a smile, as he shook hands\nin their own manner. He spoke slowly, with frequent pauses, as though\ncarefully picking his words. \"But--an old man--I know not the language\nof you.\"\n\nHe led them into a room that evidently was his study, for in it they saw\nmany strange instruments, and on a table a number of loosely bound\nsheets of parchment that were his books. They took the seats he offered\nand looked around them curiously.\n\n\"There is the clock we spoke of,\" said the Chemist, indicating one of\nthe larger instruments that stood on a pedestal in a corner of the room.\n\"Reoh will explain it to you.\"\n\nTheir host addressed the Chemist. \"From Oteo I hear--the news to-day is\nbad?\" he asked with evident concern.\n\n\"I am afraid it is,\" the Chemist answered seriously.\n\n\"And Lylda?\"\n\nThe Chemist recounted briefly the events of the day. \"We can only wait\nuntil Lylda returns,\" he finished. \"To-morrow we will talk with the\nking.\"\n\n\"Bad it is,\" said the old man slowly; \"very bad. But--we shall see----\"\n\nThe Very Young Man had risen to his feet and was standing beside the\nclock.\n\n\"How does it work?\" he asked. \"What time is it now?\"\n\nReoh appealed to his son-in-law. \"To tell of it--the words I know not.\"\n\nThe Chemist smiled. \"You are too modest, my father. But I will help you\nout, if you insist.\" He turned to the others, who were gathered around\nhim, looking at the clock.\n\n\"Our measurement of our time here,\" he began, \"like yours, is based\non----\"\n\n\"Excuse me,\" interrupted the Very Young Man. \"I just want to know first\nwhat time it is now?\"\n\n\"It is in the fourth eclipse,\" said the Chemist with a twinkle.\n\nThe Very Young Man was too surprised by this unexpected answer to\nquestion further, and the Chemist went on.\n\n\"We measure time by the astronomical movements, just as you do in your\nworld. One of the larger stars has a satellite which revolves around it\nwith extreme rapidity. Here at Arite, this satellite passes nearly\nalways directly behind its controlling star. In other words, it is\neclipsed. Ten of these eclipses measure the passage of our day. We rise\ngenerally at the first eclipse or about that time. It is now the fourth\neclipse; you would call it late afternoon. Do you see?\"\n\n\"How is the time gauged here?\" asked the Big Business Man, indicating\nthe clock.\n\nThe instrument stood upon a low stone pedestal. It consisted of a\ntransparent cylinder about twelve inches in diameter and some four feet\nhigh, surmounted by a large circular bowl. The cylinder was separated\nfrom the bowl by a broad disc of porous stone; a similar stone section\ndivided the cylinder horizontally into halves. From the bowl a fluid was\ndropping in a tiny stream through the top stone segment into the upper\ncompartment, which was now about half full. This in turn filtered\nthrough the second stone into the lower compartment. This lower section\nwas marked in front with a large number of fine horizontal lines, an\nequal distance apart, but of unequal length. In it the fluid stood now\njust above one of the longer lines-the fourth from the bottom. On the\ntop of this fluid floated a circular disc almost the size of the inside\ndiameter of the cylinder.\n\nThe Chemist explained. \"It really is very much like the old hour-glass\nwe used to have in your world. This filters liquid instead of sand. You\nwill notice the water filters twice.\" He indicated the two compartments.\n\"That is because it is necessary to have a liquid that is absolutely\npure in order that the rate at which it filters through this other stone\nmay remain constant. The clock is carefully tested, so that for each\neclipse the water will rise in this lower part of the cylinder, just the\ndistance from here to here.\"\n\nThe Chemist put his fingers on two of the longer marks.\n\n\"Very ingenious,\" remarked the Doctor. \"Is it accurate?\"\n\n\"Not so accurate as your watches, of course,\" the Chemist answered. \"But\nstill, it serves the purpose. These ten longer lines, you see, mark the\nten eclipses that constitute one of our days. The shorter lines between\nindicate halves and quarter intervals.\"\n\n\"Then it is only good for one day?\" asked the Very Young Man. \"How do\nyou set it?\"\n\n\"It resets automatically each day, at the beginning of the first\neclipse. This disc,\" the Chemist pointed to the disc floating on the\nwater in the lower compartment. \"This disc rises with the water on which\nit is floating. When it reaches the top of it, it comes in contact with\na simple mechanism--you'll see it up there--which opens a gate below and\ndrains out the water in a moment. So that every morning it is emptied\nand starts filling up again. All that is needed is to keep this bowl\nfull of water.\"\n\n\"It certainly seems very practical,\" observed the Big Business Man. \"Are\nthere many in use?\"\n\n\"Quite a number, yes. This clock was invented by Reoh, some thirty years\nago. He is the greatest scientist and scholar we have.\" The old man\nsmiled deprecatingly at this compliment.\n\n\"Are these books?\" asked the Very Young Man; he had wandered over to the\ntable and was fingering one of the bound sheets of parchment.\n\n\"They are Reoh's chronicles,\" the Chemist answered. \"The only ones of\ntheir kind in Arite.\"\n\n\"What's this?\" The Very Young Man pointed to another instrument.\n\n\"That is an astronomical instrument, something like a sextant--also an\ninvention of Reoh's. Here is a small telescope and----\" The Chemist\npaused and went over to another table standing at the side of the room.\n\n\"That reminds me, gentlemen,\" he continued; \"I have something here in\nwhich you will be greatly interested.\"\n\n\"What you--will see,\" said Reoh softly, as they gathered around the\nChemist, \"you only, of all people, can understand. Each day I look, and\nI wonder; but never can I quite believe.\"\n\n\"I made this myself, nearly ten years ago,\" said the Chemist, lifting up\nthe instrument; \"a microscope. It is not very large, you see; nor is it\nvery powerful. But I want you to look through it.\" With his\ncigar-lighter he ignited a short length of wire that burned slowly with\na brilliant blue spot of light. In his hand he held a small piece of\nstone.\n\n\"I made this microscope hoping that I might prove with it still more\nconclusively my original theory of the infinite smallness of human life.\nFor many months I searched into various objects, but without success.\nFinally I came upon this bit of rock.\" The Chemist adjusted it carefully\nunder the microscope with the light shining brilliantly upon it.\n\n\"You see I have marked one place; I am going to let you look into it\nthere.\"\n\nThe Doctor stepped forward. As he looked they heard his quick intake of\nbreath. After a moment he raised his head. On his face was an expression\nof awe too deep for words. He made place for the others, and stood\nsilent.\n\nWhen the Very Young Man's turn came he looked into the eyepiece\nawkwardly. His heart was beating fast; for some reason he felt\nfrightened.\n\nAt first he saw nothing. \"Keep the other eye open,\" said the Chemist.\n\nThe Very Young Man did as he was directed. After a moment there appeared\nbefore him a vast stretch of open country. As from a great height he\nstared down at the scene spread out below him. Gradually it became\nclearer. He saw water, with the sunlight--his own kind of sunlight it\nseemed--shining upon it. He stared for a moment more, dazzled by the\nlight. Then, nearer to him, he saw a grassy slope, that seemed to be on\na mountain-side above the water. On this slope he saw animals grazing,\nand beside them a man, formed like himself.\n\nThe Chemist's voice came to him from far away. \"We are all of us here in\na world that only occupies a portion of one little atom of the gold of a\nwedding-ring. Yet what you see there in that stone----\"\n\nThe Very Young Man raised his head. Before him stood the microscope,\nwith its fragment of stone gleaming in the blue light of the burning\nwire. He wanted to say something to show them how he felt, but no words\ncame. He looked up into the Chemist's smiling face, and smiled back a\nlittle foolishly.\n\n\"Every day I look,\" said Reoh, breaking the silence. \"And I\nsee--wonderful things. But never really--can I believe.\"\n\nAt this moment there came a violent rapping upon the outer door. As Reoh\nleft the room to open it, the Very Young Man picked up the bit of stone\nthat the Chemist had just taken from the microscope.\n\n\"I wish--may I keep it?\" he asked impulsively.\n\nThe Chemist smiled and nodded, and the Very Young Man was about to slip\nit into the pocket of his robe when Reoh hastily reentered the room,\nfollowed by Oteo. The youth was breathing heavily, as though he had been\nrunning, and on his face was a frightened look.\n\n\"Bad; very bad,\" said the old man, in a tone of deep concern, as they\ncame through the doorway.\n\n\"What is it, Oteo?\" asked the Chemist quickly. The boy answered him with\na flood of words in his native tongue.\n\nThe Chemist listened quietly. Then he turned to his companions.\n\n\"Targo has escaped,\" he said briefly. \"They sent word to me at home, and\nOteo ran here to tell me. A crowd broke into the court-house and\nreleased him. Oteo says they went away by water, and that no one is\nfollowing them.\"\n\nThe youth, who evidently understood English, added something else in his\nown language.\n\n\"He says Targo vowed death to all who have the magic power. He spoke in\nthe city just now, and promised them deliverance from the giants.\"\n\n\"Good Lord,\" murmured the Very Young Man.\n\n\"He has gone to Orlog probably,\" the Chemist continued. \"We have nothing\nto fear for the moment. But that he could speak, in the centre of Arite,\nafter this morning, and that the people would listen--\"\n\n\"It seems to me things are getting worse every minute,\" said the Big\nBusiness Man.\n\nOteo spoke again. The Chemist translated. \"The police did nothing. They\nsimply stood and listened, but took no part.\"\n\n\"Bad; very bad,\" repeated the old man, shaking his head.\n\n\"What we should do I confess I cannot tell,\" said the Chemist soberly.\n\"But that we should do something drastic is obvious.\"\n\n\"We can't do anything until Lylda gets back,\" declared the Very Young\nMan. \"We'll see what she has done. We might have had to let Targo go\nanyway.\"\n\nThe Chemist started towards the door. \"To-night, by the time of sleep,\nReoh,\" he said to the old man, \"I expect Lylda will have returned. You\nhad better come to us then with Aura. I do not think you should stay\nhere alone to sleep to-night.\"\n\n\"In a moment--Aura comes,\" Reoh answered. \"We shall be with you--very\nsoon.\"\n\nThe Chemist motioned to his companions, and with obvious reluctance on\nthe part of the Very Young Man they left, followed by Oteo.\n\nOn the way back the city seemed quiet--abnormally so. The streets were\nnearly deserted; what few pedestrians they met avoided them, or passed\nthem sullenly. They were perhaps half-way back to the Chemist's house\nwhen the Very Young Man stopped short.\n\n\"I forgot that piece of stone,\" he explained, looking at them queerly.\n\"Go on. I'll be there by the time you are,\" and disregarding the\nChemist's admonition that he might get lost he left them abruptly and\nwalked swiftly back over the way they had come.\n\nWithout difficulty, for they had made few turns, the Very Young Man\nlocated Reoh's house. As he approached he noticed the figure of a man\nlounging against a further corner of the building; the figure\ndisappeared almost as soon as he saw it.\n\nIt was a trivial incident, but, somehow, to the Very Young Man, it held\nsomething in it of impending danger. He did not knock on the outer door,\nbut finding it partly open, he slowly pushed it wider and stepped\nquietly into the hallway beyond. He was hardly inside when there came\nfrom within the house a girl's scream--a cry of horror, abruptly\nstifled.\n\nFor an instant, the Very Young Man stood hesitating. Then he dashed\nforward through an open doorway in the direction from which the cry had\nseemed to come.\n\nThe room into which he burst was Reoh's study; the room he had left only\na few moments before. On the floor, almost across his path, lay the old\nman, with the short blade of a sword buried to the hilt in his breast.\nIn a corner of the room a young Oroid girl stood with her back against\nthe wall. Her hands were pressed against her mouth; her eyes were wide\nwith terror. Bending over the body on the floor with a hand at its\narmpit, knelt the huge, gray figure of a man. At the sound of the\nintruder's entrance he looked up quickly and sprang to his feet.\n\nThe Very Young Man saw it was Targo!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\nTHE ABDUCTION\n\n\nWhen the Very Young Man left them so unceremoniously the Chemist and his\ncompanions continued on their way home, talking earnestly over the\nserious turn affairs had taken. Of the three, the Big Business Man\nappeared the most perturbed.\n\n\"Lylda isn't going to accomplish anything,\" he said. \"It won't work. The\nthing has gone too far. It isn't politics any longer; it's a struggle\nagainst us--a hatred and fear of our supernatural powers.\"\n\n\"If we had never come----\" began the Doctor.\n\n\"It probably would have worked out all right,\" finished the Big Business\nMan. \"But since we're here----\"\n\n\"We could leave,\" the Doctor suggested.\n\n\"It has gone too far; I agree with you,\" the Chemist said. \"Your going\nwould not help. They would never believe I did not still possess the\nmagic. And now, without the drugs I might not be able to cope with\naffairs. It is a very serious situation.\"\n\n\"And getting worse all the time,\" added the Big Business Man.\n\nWhen they arrived at the Chemist's home Loto did not run out to meet\nthem as the Chemist expected. They called his name, but there was no\nanswer. Inside the house they perceived at once that something was\nwrong. The living-room was in disorder; some of the pieces of furniture\nhad been overturned, and many of the smaller articles were scattered\nabout the floor. Even the wall-hangings had been torn down.\n\nIn sudden fear the Chemist ran through the building, calling to Loto.\nEverywhere he saw evidence of intruders, who had ransacked the rooms, as\nthough making a hasty search. In one of the rooms, crouched on the\nfloor, he came upon Eena, Lylda's little serving-maid. The girl was\nstricken dumb with terror. At the sight of her master she sobbed with\nrelief, and after a few moments told him what had happened.\n\nWhen the Chemist rejoined his friends in the lower room his face was set\nand white. The girl followed him closely, evidently afraid to be left\nalone. The Chemist spoke quietly, controlling his emotion with obvious\ndifficulty.\n\n\"Loto has been stolen!\" he said. \"Targo and four of his men were here\nsoon after we left. Eena saw them and hid. They searched the house----\"\n\n\"For the drugs,\" muttered the Doctor under his breath.\n\n\"----and then left, taking Loto with them.\"\n\n\"Which way did they go?\" asked the Big Business Man. \"Good God, what a\nthing!\"\n\n\"They went by water, in a large boat that was waiting for them here,\"\nanswered the Chemist.\n\n\"How long ago?\" asked the Doctor quickly. \"We have not been gone very\nlong.\"\n\n\"An hour probably, not much more.\" Eena said something to her master and\nbegan to cry softly.\n\n\"She says they left a little while ago. Three of the men took Loto away\nin the boat. She watched them from the window upstairs.\"\n\n\"_Targo ali\u00e1_,\" said the girl.\n\n\"One of the men was Targo,\" said the Chemist. He went to one of the\nwindows overlooking the lake; the Doctor stood beside him. There was no\nboat in sight.\n\n\"They cannot have got very far,\" said the Doctor. \"Those islands\nthere----\"\n\n\"They would take him to Orlog,\" said the Chemist. \"About fifty miles.\"\n\nThe Doctor turned back to the room. \"We can get them. You forget--these\ndrugs--the power they give us. Oh, Will.\" He called the Big Business Man\nover to them; he spoke hurriedly, with growing excitement. \"What do you\nthink, Will? That boat--they've got Loto--it can't be very far. We can\nmake ourselves so large in half an hour we can wade all over the lake.\nWe can get it. What do you think?\"\n\nThe Chemist dropped into a chair with his head in his hands. \"Let me\nthink--just a moment, Frank. I know the power we have; I know we can do\nalmost anything. That little boy of mine--they've got him. Let me\nthink--just a moment.\"\n\nHe sat motionless. The Doctor continued talking in a lower tone to the\nBig Business Man by the window. In the doorway Oteo stood like a statue,\nmotionless, except for his big, soft eyes that roved unceasingly over\nthe scene before him. After a moment Eena ceased her sobbing and knelt\nbeside the Chemist, looking up at him sorrowfully.\n\n\"I cannot believe,\" said the Chemist finally, raising his head, \"that\nthe safest way to rescue Loto is by the plan you have suggested.\" He\nspoke with his usual calm, judicial manner, having regained control of\nhimself completely. \"I understand now, thoroughly, and for the first\ntime, the situation we are facing. It is, as you say, a political issue\nno longer. Targo and his closest followers have convinced a very large\nproportion of our entire nation, I am certain, that myself, and my\nfamily, and you, the strangers, are possessed of a diabolical power that\nmust be annihilated. Targo will never rest until he has the drugs. That\nis why he searched this house.\n\n\"He has abducted Loto for the same purpose. He will--not hurt Loto--I am\nconvinced of that. Probably he will send someone to-morrow to demand the\ndrugs as the price of Loto's life. But don't you understand? Targo and\nhis advisers, and even the most ignorant of the people, realize what\npower we have. Lylda showed them that when she flung Targo's brother out\ninto the lake to-day. But we cannot use this power openly. For, while it\nmakes us invincible, it makes them correspondingly desperate. They are a\npeculiar people. Throughout the whole history of the race they have been\nkindly, thoughtless children. Now they are aroused. The pendulum has\nswung to the other extreme. They care little for their lives. They are\nstill children--children who will go to their death unreasoning,\nfighting against invincibility.\n\n\"That is something we must never overlook, for it is a fact. We cannot\nrun amuck as giants over this world and hope to conquer it. We could\nconquer it, yes; but only when the last of its inhabitants had been\nkilled; stamped out like ants defending their hill from the attacks of\nan elephant. Don't you see I am right?\"\n\n\"Then Lylda----\" began the Doctor, as the Chemist paused.\n\n\"Lylda will fail. Her venture to-day will make matters immeasurably\nworse.\"\n\n\"You're right,\" agreed the Big Business Man. \"We should have realized.\"\n\n\"So you see we cannot make ourselves large and recapture Loto by force.\nThey would anticipate us and kill him.\"\n\n\"Then what shall we do?\" demanded the Doctor. \"We must do something.\"\n\n\"That we must decide carefully, for we must make no more mistakes. But\nwe can do nothing at this moment. The lives of all of us are threatened.\nWe must not allow ourselves to become separated. We must wait here for\nLylda. Reoh and Aura must stay with us. Then we can decide how to rescue\nLoto and what to do after that. But we must keep together.\"\n\n\"Jack ought to be here by now,\" said the Big Business Man. \"I hope Reoh\nand Aura come with him.\"\n\nFor over an hour they waited, and still the Very Young Man did not come.\nThey had just decided to send Oteo to see what had become of him and to\nbring down Reoh and his daughter, when Lylda unexpectedly returned. It\nwas Eena, standing at one of the side windows, who first saw her\nmistress. A cry from the girl brought them all to the window. Far away\nbeyond the city they could see the gigantic figure of Lylda, towering\nseveral hundred feet in the air.\n\nAs she came closer she seemed to stop, near the outskirts of the city,\nand then they saw her dwindling in size until she disappeared, hidden\nfrom their view by the houses near at hand.\n\nIn perhaps half an hour more she reappeared, picking her way carefully\ndown the deserted street towards them. She was at this time about forty\nfeet tall. At the corner, a hundred yards away from them a little group\nof people ran out, and, with shouts of anger, threw something at her as\nshe passed.\n\nShe stooped down towards them, and immediately they scurried for safety\nout of her reach.\n\nOnce inside of her own garden, where the Chemist and his companions were\nwaiting, Lylda lost no time in becoming her normal size again. As she\ngrew smaller, she sat down with her back against a little tree. Her face\nwas white and drawn; her eyes were full of tears as she looked at her\nhusband and his friends.\n\nWhen the drug had ceased to act, the Chemist sat beside her. She had\nstarted out only a few hours before a crusader, dominant, forceful; she\ncame back now, a tired, discouraged little woman. The Chemist put his\narm around her protectingly, drawing her drooping body towards him.\n\"Very bad news, Lylda, we know,\" he said gently.\n\n\"Oh, my husband,\" she cried brokenly. \"So sorry I am--so very sorry. The\nbest I knew I did. And it was all so very bad--so very bad----\" she\nbroke off abruptly, looking at him with her great, sorrowful eyes.\n\n\"Tell us Lylda,\" he said softly.\n\n\"To many cities I went,\" she answered. \"And I told the people all I\nmeant to say. Some of them believed. But they were not many, and of the\nothers who did not believe, they were afraid, and so kept they silent.\nThen into Orlog I went, and in the public square I spoke--for very long,\nbecause, for some reason I know not, at first they listened.\n\n\"But no one there believed. And then, my husband, at last I knew why I\ncould not hope to gain my way. It is not because they want Targo's rule\nthat they oppose us. It was, but it is so no longer. It is because they\nhave been made to fear these drugs we have. For now, in Orlog, they are\nshouting death to all the giants. Forgotten are all their cries for\nland--the things that Targo promised, and we in Arite would not give. It\nis death to all the giants they are shouting now: death to you, to me,\nto us all, because we have these drugs.\"\n\n\"Did they attack you?\" asked the Big Business Man.\n\n\"Many things they threw,\" Lylda answered. \"But I was so big,\" she smiled\na little sad, twisted smile. \"What they could do was as nothing. And\nbecause of that they fear and hate us so; yet never have I seen such\nfearless things as those they did. Death to the giants was their only\ncry. And I could have killed them--hundreds, thousands--yet never could\nI have made them stop while yet they were alive.\n\n\"I told them Targo I would free. And in Orlog they laughed. For they\nsaid that he would free himself before I had returned.\"\n\n\"He did,\" muttered the Big Business Man.\n\n\"Targo escaped this afternoon,\" the Chemist explained. \"He went to Orlog\nby boat and took----\" He stopped abruptly. \"Come into the house, Lylda,\"\nhe added gently; \"there are other things, my wife, of which we must\nspeak.\" He rose to his feet, pulling her up with him.\n\n\"Where is Jack,\" she asked, looking at the Big Business Man, who stood\nwatching her gravely. \"And where is Loto? Does he not want to see his\nmother who tried so----\" She put her arms around the Chemist's neck. \"So\nvery hard I tried,\" she finished softly. \"So very hard, because--I\nthought----\"\n\nThe Chemist led her gently into the house. The Doctor started to follow,\nbut the Big Business Man held him back. \"It is better not,\" he said in\nan undertone, \"don't you think?\" Oteo was standing near them, and the\nBig Business Man motioned to him. \"Besides,\" he added, \"I'm worried\nabout Jack. I think we ought to go up after him. I don't think it ought\nto take us very long.\"\n\n\"With Oteo--he knows the way,\" agreed the Doctor. \"It's devilish strange\nwhat's keeping that boy.\"\n\nThey found that although Oteo spoke only a few words of English, he\nunderstood nearly everything they said, and waiting only a moment more,\nthey started up into the city towards Reoh's home.\n\nIn the living-room of the house, the Chemist sat Lylda gently down on a\ncushion in front of the hearth. Sitting beside her, he laid his hand on\nhers that rested on her knee.\n\n\"For twelve years, Lylda, we have lived together,\" he began slowly. \"And\nno sorrow has come to us; no danger has threatened us or those we\nloved.\" He met his wife's questioning gaze unflinchingly and went on:\n\n\"You have proved yourself a wonderful woman, my wife. You never\nknew--nor those before you--the conflict of human passions. No danger\nbefore has ever threatened you or those you loved.\" He saw her eyes grow\nwider.\n\n\"Very strange you talk, my husband. There is something----\"\n\n\"There is something, Lylda. To-day you have seen strife, anger, hate\nand--and death. You have met them all calmly; you have fought them all\njustly, like a woman--a brave, honest Oroid woman, who can wrong no one.\nThere is something now that I must tell you.\" He saw the growing fear in\nher eyes and hurried on.\n\n\"Loto, to-day--this afternoon----\"\n\nThe woman gave a little, low cry of anguish, instantly repressed. Her\nhand gripped his tightly.\n\n\"No, no, Lylda, not that,\" he said quickly, \"but this afternoon while we\nwere all away--Loto was here alone with Eena--Targo with his men came.\nThey did not hurt Loto; they took him away in a boat to Orlog.\" He\nstopped abruptly. Lylda's eyes never left his face. Her breath came\nfast; she put a hand to her mouth and stifled the cry that rose to her\nlips.\n\n\"They will not hurt him, Lylda; that I know. And soon we will have him\nback.\"\n\nFor a moment more her searching eyes stared steadily into his. He heard\nthe whispered words, \"My little son--with Targo,\" come slowly from her\nlips; then with a low, sobbing cry she dropped senseless into his arms.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\nAURA\n\n\nThe Very Young Man involuntarily took a step backward as he met Targo's\neyes, glaring at him across the old man's body. The girl in the corner\ngave another cry--a cry of fright and horror, yet with a note of relief.\nThe Very Young Man found himself wondering who she was; then he knew.\n\nHis first impulse was to leap across the room towards her. He thought of\nthe chemicals and instinctively his hand went to his armpit. But he knew\nthere was no time for that. He hesitated one brief instant. As he stood\nrigid Targo stooped swiftly and grasped the dagger in his victim's\nbreast.\n\nThe girl screamed again, louder this time, and like a mask the Very\nYoung Man's indecision fell from him. He stood alert, clear-headed. Here\nwas an enemy threatening him--an enemy he must fight and overcome.\n\nIn the second that Targo bent down the Very Young Man bounded forward,\nand with a leap that his football days had taught him so well how to\nmake, he landed squarely upon the bare, broad back of his antagonist.\nThe impact of his weight forced Targo down upon the floor, and losing\nhis balance he fell, with the Very Young Man on top of him. They hit the\nleg of the table as they rolled over, and something dropped from it to\nthe floor, striking the stone surface with a thud.\n\nThe knife still stuck in the dead man's body. The Very Young Man thought\nhe could reach it, but his opponent's great arms were around him now and\nheld him too tightly. He tried to pull himself loose, but could not.\nThen he rolled partly over again, and met Targo's eyes above, leering\ntriumphantly down at him. He looked away and wrenched his right arm\nfree. Across the room he could see the girl still crouching in the\ncorner. His right hand sweeping along the floor struck something heavy\nlying there. His fingers closed over it; he raised it up, and hardly\nknowing what he did, crashed it against his enemy's head.\n\nHe felt the tense muscles of the man relax, and then the weight of his\ninert body as it pressed down upon him. He wriggled free, and sprang to\nhis feet. As he stood weak and trembling, looking down at the\nunconscious form of Targo lying upon the floor, the girl suddenly ran\nover and stood beside him. Her slim little body came only a little above\nhis shoulder; instinctively he put his arm about her.\n\nA voice, calling from outside the room, made the girl look up into his\nface with new terror.\n\n\"Others are coming,\" she whispered tensely and huddled up against him.\n\nThe Very Young Man saw that the room had two doors--the one through\nwhich he had entered, and another in one of its other walls. There were\nno windows. He pulled the girl now towards the further door, but she\nheld him back.\n\n\"They come that way,\" she whispered.\n\nAnother voice sounded behind him and the Very Young Man knew that a man\nwas coming up along the passageway from the front entrance. Targo's men!\nHe remembered now the skulking figure he had seen outside the house.\nThere were more than two, for now he heard other voices, and some one\ncalling Targo's name.\n\nHe held the girl closer and stood motionless. Like rats in a trap, he\nthought. He felt the fingers of his right hand holding something heavy.\nIt was a piece of stone--the stone he had looked at through the\nmicroscope--the stone with which he had struck Targo. He smiled to\nhimself, and slipped it into his pocket.\n\nThe girl had slowly pulled him over to the inner wall of the room. The\nfootsteps came closer. They would be here in a moment. The Very Young\nMan wondered how he should fight them all; then he thought of the knife\nthat was still in the murdered man's body. He thought he ought to get it\nnow while there was still time. He heard a click and the wall against\nwhich he and the girl were leaning yielded with their weight. A door\nswung open--a door the Very Young Man had not seen before. The girl\npulled him through the doorway, and swung the door softly closed behind\nthem.\n\nThe Very Young Man found himself now in a long, narrow room with a very\nhigh ceiling. It had, apparently, no other door, and no windows. It was\nevidently a storeroom--piled high with what looked like boxes, and with\nbales of silks and other fabrics.\n\nThe Very Young Man looked around him hastily. Then he let go of the\ngirl, and, since locks were unknown in this world, began piling as many\nheavy objects as possible against the door. The girl tried to help him,\nbut he pushed her away. Once he put his ear to the door and listened. He\nheard voices outside in the strange Oroid tongue.\n\nThe girl stood beside him. \"They are lifting Targo up. He speaks; he is\nnot dead,\" she whispered.\n\nFor several minutes they stood there listening. The voices continued in\na low murmur. \"They'll know we are in here,\" said the Very Young Man\nfinally, in an undertone. \"Is there any other way out of this room?\"\n\nThe girl shook her head. The Very Young Man forgot the import of her\nanswer, and suddenly found himself thinking she was the prettiest girl\nhe had ever seen. She was hardly more than sixteen, with a slender, not\nyet matured, yet perfectly rounded little body. She wore, like Lylda, a\nshort blue silk tunic, with a golden cord crossing her breast and\nencircling her waist. Her raven black hair hung in two twisted locks\nnearly to her knees. Her skin was very white and, even more than\nLylda's, gleamed with iridescent color.\n\n\"Only this one door,\" said the girl. The words brought the Very Young\nMan to himself with a start.\n\nNo other way out of the room! He knew that Targo and his men would force\ntheir way in very soon. He could not prevent them. But it would take\ntime. The Very Young Man remembered that now he had time to take the\nchemicals. He put his hand to his armpit and felt the pouch that held\nthe drug. He wondered which to take. The ceiling was very high; but to\nfight in the narrow confines of such a room----\n\nHe led the girl over to a pile of cushions and sat down beside her.\n\n\"Listen,\" he said briefly. \"We are going to take a medicine; it will\nmake us very small. Then we will hide from Targo and his men till they\nare gone. This is not magic; it is science. Do you understand?\"\n\n\"I understand,\" the girl answered readily. \"One of the strangers you\nare--my brother's friend.\"\n\n\"You will not be afraid to take the drug?\"\n\n\"No.\" But though she spoke confidently, she drew closer to him and\nshivered a little.\n\nThe Very Young Man handed her one of the tiny pellets. \"Just touch it to\nthe tip of your tongue as I do,\" he said warningly.\n\nThey took the drug. When it had ceased to act, they found themselves\nstanding on the rough uneven stone surface that was the floor of the\nroom. Far overhead in the dim luminous blackness they could just make\nout the great arching ceiling, stretching away out of sight down the\nlength of the room. Beside them stood a tremendous shaggy pile of\ncoarsely woven objects that were the silk pillows on which they had been\nsitting a moment before--pillows that seemed forty or fifty feet square\nnow and loomed high above their heads.\n\nThe Very Young Man took the frightened girl by the hand and led her\nalong the tremendous length of a pile of boxes, blocks long it seemed.\nThese boxes, from their size, might have been rectangular, windowless\nhouses, jammed closely together, and piled one upon the other up into\nthe air almost out of sight.\n\nFinally they came to a broad passageway between the boxes--a mere crack\nit would have been before. They turned into it, and, a few feet beyond,\ncame to a larger square space with a box making a roof over it some\ntwenty feet above their heads.\n\nFrom this retreat they could see the lower part of the door leading into\nthe other room and could hear from beyond it a muffled roar--the voices\nof Targo and his men. Hardly were they hidden when the door opened a\nlittle. It struck against the bales the Very Young Man had piled against\nit. For a moment it held, but with the united efforts of the men pushing\nfrom the other side, it slowly yielded and swung open.\n\nTargo stepped into the room. To the Very Young Man he seemed nearly a\nhundred feet high. Only his feet and ankles were visible at first, from\nwhere the Very Young Man was watching. Three other men came with him.\nThey stamped back and forth for a time, moving some of the bales and\nboxes. Luckily they left undisturbed those nearest the fugitives; after\na moment they left, leaving the door open.\n\nThe Very Young Man breathed a long sigh of relief. \"Gosh, I'm glad\nthat's over.\" He spoke in a low tone, although the men in the other room\nseemed so far away they would hardly have heard him if he had shouted at\nthe top of his voice.\n\nAlone with the girl now in this great silent room, the Very Young Man\nfelt suddenly embarrassed. \"I am one of your brother's friends,\" he\nsaid. \"My name's Jack; is yours Aura?\"\n\n\"Lylda's sister I am,\" she answered quietly. \"My father told me about\nyou----\" Then with a rush came the memory of her father's death, which\nthe startling experiences of the past half-hour had made her forget. Her\nbig, soft eyes filled with tears and her lips quivered. Involuntarily\nthe Very Young Man put his arm about her again and held her close to\nhim. She was so little and frail--so pathetic and so wholly adorable.\nFor a long time they sat in silence; then the girl gently drew away.\n\nAt the doorway they stood and listened; Targo and his followers were\nstill in the adjoining room, talking earnestly. \"Loto they have\ncaptured,\" Aura whispered suddenly. \"Others of Targo's men have taken\nhim--in a boat--to Orlog. To-morrow they send a messenger to my brother\nto demand he give up these drugs--or Loto they will kill.\"\n\nThe Very Young Man waited, breathless. Suddenly he heard Targo laugh--a\ncruel, cynical laugh. Aura shuddered.\n\n\"And when he has the drug, all of us will he kill. And all in the land\ntoo who will not do as he bids.\"\n\nThe men were rising, evidently in preparation to leave. Aura continued:\n\"They go--now--to Orlog--all but Targo. A little way from here, up the\nlake shore, a boat is waiting. It will take them there fast.\"\n\nWith a last look around, Targo and his followers disappeared through the\nback door of the room. An outer door clanged noisily, and the Very Young\nMan and Aura were left alone in the house.\n\nReoh murdered, Loto stolen! The Very Young Man thought of Lylda and\nwondered if anything could have happened to her. \"Did they speak of your\nsister?\" he asked.\n\n\"Targo said--he--he would put her to death,\" Aura answered with a\nshudder. \"He said--she killed his brother to-day.\" She turned to the\nVery Young Man impulsively, putting her little hands up on his\nshoulders. \"Oh, my friend,\" she exclaimed. \"You can do something to save\nmy family? Targo is so strong, so cruel. My father----\" She stopped, and\nchoked back a sob.\n\n\"Did they say where Lylda was now?\"\n\n\"They did not know. She grew very big and went away.\"\n\n\"Where is your brother and my two friends?\"\n\n\"Targo said they were here when he--he took Loto. Now they have gone\nhome. He was afraid of them--now--because they have the drugs.\"\n\n\"To-morrow they are going to send a messenger from Orlog to demand the\ndrugs?\"\n\n\"He said to-morrow. Oh, you will do something for us? You can save\nLoto?\"\n\nThe Very Young Man was beginning to formulate a plan. \"And to-night,\" he\nasked, \"from what they said--are you sure they will not hurt Loto?\"\n\n\"They said no. But he is so little--so----\" The girl burst into tears,\nand at every sob the Very Young Man's heart leaped in his breast. He\nwanted to comfort her, but he could think of no word to say; he wanted\nto help her--to do the best thing in what he saw was a grave crisis.\nWhat he should have done was to have taken her back to the Chemist and\nhis friends, and then with them planned the rescue of Loto. But with the\ngirl's hands upon his shoulders, and her sorrowful little tear-stained\nface looking up to his, he did not think of that. He thought only of her\nand her pathetic appeal. \"You will do something, my friend? You can save\nLoto?\" He could save Loto! With the power of the drugs he could do\nanything!\n\nThe Very Young Man made a sudden decision. \"I don't know the way to\nOrlog; you do?\" he asked abruptly.\n\n\"Oh yes, I know it well.\"\n\n\"We will go to Orlog, you and I--now, and rescue Loto. You will not be\nafraid?\"\n\nThe girl's eyes looked into his with a clear, steady gaze. The Very\nYoung Man stared down into their depths with his heart pounding. \"I\nshall not be afraid--with you,\" said the girl softly.\n\nThe Very Young Man drew a long breath. He knew he must think it all out\ncarefully. The drug would make them very large, and in a short time they\ncould walk to Orlog. No harm could come to them. Once in Orlog they\nwould find Loto--probably in Targo's palace--and bring him back with\nthem. The Very Young Man pictured the surprise and gratification of the\nChemist and his friends. Lylda would be back by then; no sooner would\nshe have heard of Loto's loss than he would bring him back to her. Or\nperhaps they would meet Lylda and she would join them.\n\nThe Very Young Man produced the drug and was about to give Aura one of\nthe pellets when another thought occurred to him. Targo would not harm\nLoto now because he was valuable as a hostage. But suppose he saw these\ntwo giants coming to the rescue? The Very Young Man knew that probably\nthe boy would be killed before he could save him. That way would not do.\nHe would have to get to Orlog unseen--rescue Loto by a sudden rush,\nbefore they could harm him.\n\nBut first it would be necessary for him and Aura to get out of Arite\nquietly without causing any excitement. Once in the open country they\ncould grow larger and travel rapidly to Orlog. The Very Young Man\nthought it would be best to be normal size while leaving Arite. He\nexplained his plan to Aura briefly.\n\nIt took several successive tastes of the different drugs before this\nresult was accomplished, but in perhaps half an hour they were ready to\nleave the house. To the Very Young Man this change of size was no longer\neven startling. Aura, this time, with him beside her, seemed quite\nunafraid.\n\n\"Now we're ready,\" said the Very Young Man, in a matter-of-fact tone\nthat was far from indicating his true feeling. \"Take the way where we\nare least likely to be noticed--towards Orlog. When we get in the open\ncountry we can get bigger.\"\n\nHe led the girl across Reoh's study. She kept her face averted as they\npassed the body lying on the floor, and in a moment they were outside\nthe house. They walked rapidly, keeping close to the walls of the\nhouses. The streets were nearly deserted and no one seemed to notice\nthem.\n\nThe Very Young Man was calculating the time. \"Probably they are just\ngetting to Orlog with Loto,\" he said. \"Once we get out of Arite we'll\ntravel fast; we'll have him back in two or three hours.\"\n\nAura said nothing, but walked beside him. Once or twice she looked back\nover her shoulder.\n\nThey were in the outskirts of the city, when suddenly the girl gripped\nher companion by the arm.\n\n\"Some one--behind us,\" she whispered. The Very Young Man resisted an\nimpulse to look around. They had come to a cross street; the Very Young\nMan abruptly turned the corner, and clutching Aura by the hand ran\nswiftly forward a short distance. When they had slowed down to a walk\nagain the Very Young Man looked cautiously back over his shoulder. As he\ndid so he caught a glimpse of three men who had just reached the corner,\nand who darted hastily back out of sight as he turned his head.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\nTHE ATTACK ON THE PALACE\n\n\nOteo led the two men swiftly through the city towards Reoh's house.\nThere were few pedestrians about and no one seemed particularly to\nnotice them. Yet somehow, the Big Business Man thought, there hung about\nthe city an ominous air of unrest. Perhaps it was the abnormal\nquiet--that solemn sinister look of deserted streets; or perhaps it was\nan occasional face peering at them from a window, or a figure lurking in\na doorway disappearing at their approach. The Big Business Man found his\nheart beating fast. He suddenly felt very much alone. The realization\ncame to him that he was in a strange world, surrounded by beings of\nanother race, most of whom, he knew now, hated and feared him and those\nwho had come with him.\n\nThen his thoughts took another turn. He looked up at the brilliant\ngalaxy of stars overhead. New, unexplored worlds! Thousands, millions of\nthem! In one tiny, little atom of a woman's wedding-ring! Then he\nthought of his friend the Banker. Perhaps the ring had not been moved\nfrom its place in the clubroom. Then--he looked at the sky again--then\nBroadway--only thirty feet away from him this moment! He smiled a little\nat this conception, and drew a long breath--awed by his thoughts.\n\nOteo was plucking at his sleeve and pointing. Across the street stood\nReoh's house. The Doctor knocked upon its partially open front door,\nand, receiving no answer, they entered silently, with the dread sense of\nimpending evil hanging over them. The Doctor led the way into the old\nman's study. At the threshold he stopped, shocked into immobility. Upon\nthe floor, with the knife still in it, lay Reoh's body. The Doctor made\na hasty examination, although the presence of the knife obviously made\nit unnecessary.\n\nA hurried search of the house convinced them that Aura and the Very\nYoung Man were not there. The two men, confused by this double disaster,\nwere at a loss to know what to do.\n\n\"They've got him,\" said the Big Business Man with conviction. \"And the\ngirl too, probably. He must have come back just as they were killing\nReoh.\"\n\n\"There wasn't much time,\" the Doctor said. \"He was back here in ten\nminutes. But they've got him--you're right--or he would have been back\nwith us before this.\"\n\n\"They'll take him and the girl to Orlog. They won't hurt them because\nthey----\" The Big Business Man stopped abruptly; his face went white.\n\"Good God, Frank, do you realize? They've got the drugs now!\"\n\nTargo had the drugs! The Big Business Man shuddered with fear at the\nthought. Their situation would be desperate, indeed, if that were so.\n\nThe Doctor reasoned it out more calmly. \"I hadn't thought of that,\" he\nsaid slowly. \"And it makes me think perhaps they have not captured Jack.\nIf they had the drugs they would lose no time in using them. They\nhaven't used them yet--that's evident.\"\n\nThe Big Business Man was about to reply when there came a shouting from\nthe street outside, and the sound of many feet rushing past the house.\nThey hurried to the door. A mob swept by--a mob of nearly a thousand\npersons. Most of them were men. Some were armed with swords; others\nbrandished huge stones or lengths of beaten gold implements, perhaps\nwith which they had been working, and which now they held as weapons.\n\nThe mob ran swiftly, with vainglorious shouts from its leaders. It\nturned a corner nearby and disappeared.\n\nFrom every house now people appeared, and soon the streets were full of\nscurrying pedestrians. Most of them followed the direction taken by the\nmob. The listeners in the doorway could hear now, from far away, the\nsound of shouts and cheering. And from all around them came the buzz and\nhum of busy streets. The city was thoroughly awake--alert and expectant.\n\nThe Big Business Man flung the door wide. \"I'm going to follow that\ncrowd. See what's going on. We can't stay here in the midst of this.\"\n\nThe Doctor and Oteo followed him out into the street, and they mingled\nwith the hastening crowd. In their excitement they walked freely among\nthe people. No one appeared to notice them, for the crowd was as excited\nas they, hurrying along, heedless of its immediate surroundings. As they\nadvanced, the street became more congested.\n\nDown another street they saw fighting going on--a weaponless crowd\nswaying and struggling aimlessly. A number of armed men charged this\ncrowd--men who by their breastplates and swords the Big Business Man\nrecognized as the police. The crowd ceased struggling and dispersed,\nonly to gather again in another place.\n\nThe city was in a turmoil of excitement without apparent reason, or\ndefinite object. Yet there was a steady tide in the direction the first\narmed mob had gone, and with that tide went the Big Business Man and his\ntwo companions.\n\nAfter a time they came to an open park, beyond which, on a prominence,\nwith the lake behind, stood a large building that the Chemist had\nalready pointed out to them as the king's palace.\n\nOteo led them swiftly into a side street to avoid the dense crowd around\nthe park. Making a slight detour they came back to it again--much nearer\nthe palace now--and approached from behind a house that fronted the open\nspace near the palace.\n\n\"Friend of the Master--his house!\" Oteo explained as he knocked\nperemptorily at a side door.\n\nThey waited a moment, but no one came. Oteo pushed the door and led them\nwithin. The house was deserted, and following Oteo, they went to the\nroof. Here they could see perfectly what was going on around the palace,\nand in the park below them.\n\nThis park was nearly triangular in shape--a thousand feet possibly on\neach side. At the base of the triangle, on a bluff with the lake behind\nit, stood the palace. Its main entrance, two huge golden doors, stood at\nthe top of a broad flight of stone steps. On these steps a fight was in\nprogress. A mob surged up them, repulsed at the top by a score or more\nof men armed with swords, who were defending the doorway.\n\nThe square was thronged with people watching the palace steps and\nshouting almost continuously. The fight before the palace evidently had\nbeen in progress for some time. Many dead were lying in the doorway and\non the steps below it. The few defenders had so far resisted\nsuccessfully against tremendous odds, for the invaders, pressed upward\nby those behind, could not retreat, and were being killed at the top\nfrom lack of space in which to fight.\n\n\"Look there,\" cried the Big Business Man suddenly. Coming down a cross\nstreet, marching in orderly array with its commander in front, was a\ncompany of soldier police. It came to a halt almost directly beneath the\nwatchers on the roof-tops, and its leader brandishing his sword after a\nmoment of hesitation, ordered his men to charge the crowd. They did not\nmove at the order, but stood sullenly in their places. Again he ordered\nthem forward, and, as they refused to obey, made a threatening move\ntowards them.\n\nIn sudden frenzy, those nearest leaped upon him, and in an instant he\nlay dead upon the ground, with half a dozen swords run through his body.\nThen the men stood, in formation still, apathetically watching the\nevents that were going on around them.\n\nMeanwhile the fight on the palace steps raged more furiously than ever.\nThe defenders were reduced now to a mere handful.\n\n\"A moment more--they'll be in,\" said the Doctor breathlessly. Hardly had\nhe spoken when, with a sudden, irresistible rush, the last of the guards\nwere swept away, and the invaders surged through the doorway into the\npalace.\n\nA great cry went up from the crowd in the park as the palace was\ntaken--a cry of applause mingled with awe, for they were a little\nfrightened at what they were seeing.\n\nPerhaps a hundred people crowded through the doorway into the palace;\nthe others stood outside--on the steps and on the terrace\nbelow--waiting. Hardly more than five minutes went by when a man\nappeared on the palace roof. He advanced to the parapet with several\nothers standing respectfully behind him.\n\n\"Targo!\" murmured Oteo.\n\nIt was Targo--Targo triumphantly standing with uplifted arms before the\npeople he was to rule. When the din that was raised at his appearance\nhad subsided a little he spoke; one short sentence, and then he paused.\nThere was a moment of indecision in the crowd before it broke into\ntumultuous cheers.\n\n\"The king--he killed,\" Oteo said softly, looking at his master's friends\nwith big, frightened eyes.\n\nThe Big Business Man stared out over the waving, cheering throng, with\nthe huge, dominant, triumphant figure of Targo above and muttered to\nhimself, \"The king is dead; long live the king.\"\n\nWhen he could make himself heard, Targo spoke again. The Doctor and the\nBig Business Man were leaning over the parapet watching the scene, when\nsuddenly a stone flew up from the crowd beneath, and struck the railing\nwithin a few feet of where they were standing. They glanced down in\nsurprise, and realized, from the faces that were upturned, that they\nwere recognized. A murmur ran over the crowd directly below, and then\nsomeone raised a shout. Four words it seemed to be, repeated over and\nover. Gradually the shout spread--\"Death to the Giants,\" the Big\nBusiness Man knew it was--\"Death to the Giants,\" until the whole mass of\npeople were calling it rhythmically--drowning out Targo's voice\ncompletely. A thousand faces now stared up at the men on the roof-top\nand a rain of stones began falling around them.\n\nThe Doctor clutched his friend by the arm and pulled him back from the\nparapet. \"They know us--good God, don't you see?\" he said tensely. \"Come\non. We must get out of this. There'll be trouble.\" He started across the\nroof towards the opening that led down into the house.\n\nThe Big Business Man jerked himself free from the grasp that held him.\n\n\"I do see,\" he cried a little wildly. \"I do see we've been damn fools.\nThere'll be trouble. You're right--there will be trouble; but it won't\nbe ours. I'm through--through with this miserable little atom and its\nswarm of insects.\" He gripped the Doctor by both shoulders. \"My God,\nFrank, can't you understand? We're men, you and I--men! These\ncreatures\"--he waved his arm back towards the city--\"nothing but\ninsects--infinitesimal--smaller than the smallest thing we ever dreamed\nof. And we take them seriously. Don't you understand? Seriously! God,\nman, that's funny, not tragic.\"\n\nHe fumbled at the neck of his robe, and tearing it away, brought out a\nvial of the drugs.\n\n\"Here,\" he exclaimed, and offered one of the pellets.\n\n\"Not too much,\" warned the Doctor vehemently, \"only touch it to your\ntongue.\"\n\nOteo, with pleading eyes, watched them taking the drug, and the Doctor\nhanded him a pellet, showing him how to take it.\n\nAs they stood together upon the roof-top, clinging to one another, the\ncity dwindled away rapidly beneath them. By the time the drug had ceased\nto act there was hardly room for them to stand on the roof, and the\nhouse, had it not been built solidly of stone, would have been crushed\nunder their weight. At first they felt a little dizzy, as though they\nwere hanging in mid-air, or were in a balloon, looking down at the city.\nThen gradually, they seemed to be of normal size again, balancing\nthemselves awkwardly upon a little toy-house whose top was hardly bigger\nthan their feet.\n\nThe park, only a step now beneath the house-top, swarmed with tiny\nfigures less than two inches in height. Targo still stood upon the\npalace roof; they could have reached down and picked him up between\nthumb and forefinger. The whole city lay within a radius of a few\nhundred feet around them.\n\nWhen they had stopped increasing in size, they leaped in turn over the\npalace, landing upon the broad beach of the lake. Then they began\nwalking along it. There was only room for one on the sand, and the other\ntwo, for they walked abreast, waded ankle-deep in the water. From the\nlittle city below them they could hear the hum of a myriad of tiny\nvoices--thin, shrill and faint. Suddenly the Big Business Man laughed.\nThere was no hysteria in his voice now--just amusement and relief.\n\n\"And we took that seriously,\" he said. \"Funny, isn't it?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\nON THE LAKE\n\n\n\"You're right--we are being followed,\" the Very Young Man said soberly.\nHe had pulled the girl over close against the wall of a house. \"Did you\nsee that?\"\n\n\"Three, they are,\" Aura answered. \"I saw them before--in the street\nbelow--Targo's men.\"\n\nEvidently the three men had been watching the house from which they had\ncome and had followed them from there. If they were Targo's men, as\nseemed very probable, the Very Young Man could not understand why they\nhad not already attacked him. Perhaps they intended to as soon as he and\nAura had reached a more secluded part of the city. They must know he had\nthe drugs, and to gain possession of those certainly was what they were\nstriving for. The Very Young Man realized he must take no chances; to\nlose the drugs would be fatal to them all.\n\n\"Are we near the edge of the city?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes, very near.\"\n\n\"Then we shall get large here. If we make a run for it we will be in the\ncountry before we are big enough to attract too much attention.\nUnderstand, Aura?\"\n\n\"I understand.\"\n\n\"We mustn't stir up the city if we can help it; with giants running\naround, the people would get worked up to a frenzy. You could see that\nwith Lylda this afternoon. Not that you can blame them altogether, but\nwe want to get Loto back before we start anything here in Arite.\" He\ntook the pellets out as he spoke, and they each touched one of them to\nthe tip of their tongues.\n\n\"Now, then, come on--not too fast, we want to keep going,\" said the Very\nYoung Man, taking the girl by the hand again.\n\nAs they started off, running slowly down the street, the Very Young Man\nlooked back. The three men were running after them--not fast, seeming\ncontent merely to keep their distance. The Very Young Man laughed. \"Wait\ntill they see us get big. Fine chance they've got.\"\n\nAura, her lithe, young body in perfect condition, ran lightly and easily\nas a fawn. She made a pretty picture as she ran, with her long, black\nhair streaming out behind her, and the short silk tunic flapping about\nher lean, round thighs. She still held the Very Young Man by the hand,\nrunning just in advance of him, guiding him through the streets, which\nin this part of the city were more broken up and irregular.\n\nThey had not gone more than a hundred yards when the pavement began to\nmove unsteadily under them, as the deck of a plunging ship feels to one\nwho runs its length, and the houses they were swiftly passing began\nvisibly to decrease in size. The Very Young Man felt the girl falter in\nher stride. He dropped her hand and slipped his arm about her waist,\nholding her other hand against it. She smiled up into his eyes, and thus\nthey ran on, side by side.\n\nA few moments more and they were in the open country, running on a road\nthat wound through the hills, between cultivated fields dotted here and\nthere with houses. The landscape dwindled beneath them steadily, until\nthey seemed to be running along a narrow, curving path, bordered by\nlittle patches of different-colored ground, like a checkerboard. The\nhouses they passed now hardly reached as high as their knees. Sometimes\npeasants stood in the doorways of these houses watching them in terror.\nOccasionally they passed a farmer ploughing his field, who stopped his\nwork, stricken dumb, and stared at them as they went swiftly by.\n\nWhen they were well out into the country, perhaps a quarter of the way\nto Orlog--for to beings so huge as they the distance was not great--the\nVery Young Man slowed down to a walk.\n\n\"How far have we gone?\" he asked.\n\nAura stopped abruptly and looked around her. They seemed now to be at\nthe bottom of a huge, circular, shallow bowl. In every direction from\nwhere they stood the land curved upward towards the rim of the bowl that\nwas the horizon--a line, not sharp and well defined, but dim and hazy,\nmelting away into the blackness of the star-studded sky. Behind them,\nhardly more than a mile away, according to their present stature--they\nhad stopped growing entirely now--lay the city of Arite. They could see\ncompletely across it and out into the country beyond.\n\nThe lake, with whose shore they had been running parallel, was much\ncloser to them. Ahead, up near the rim of the horizon, lay a black\nsmudge. Aura pointed. \"Orlog is there,\" she said. \"You see it?\"\n\nTo the Very Young Man suddenly came the realization that already he was\nfacing the problem of how to get into Orlog unheralded. If they remained\nin their present size they could easily walk there in an hour or less.\nBut long before that they would be seen and recognized.\n\nThe Very Young Man feared for Loto's safety if he allowed that to\nhappen. He seemed to be able to make out the city of Orlog now. It was\nsmaller than Arite, and lay partially behind a hill, with most of its\nhouses strung along the lake shore. If only they were not so tall they\ncould not be seen so readily. But if they became smaller it would take\nthem much longer to get there. And eventually they would have to become\nnormal Oroid size, or even smaller, in order to get into the city\nunnoticed. The Very Young Man thought of the lake. Perhaps that would be\nthe best way.\n\n\"Can you swim?\" he asked. And Aura, with her ready smile, answered that\nshe could. \"If we are in the water,\" she added, seeming to have followed\nhis thoughts, \"they would not see us. I can swim very far--can you?\"\n\nThe Very Young Man nodded.\n\n\"If we could get near to Orlog in the water,\" he said, \"we might get a\nboat. And then when we were small, we could sail up. They wouldn't see\nus then.\"\n\n\"There are many boats,\" answered the girl in agreement. \"Look!\"\n\nThere were, indeed, on the lake, within sight of them now, several\nboats. \"We must get the one nearest Orlog,\" the Very Young Man said. \"Or\nelse it will beat us in and carry the news.\"\n\nIn a few minutes more they were at the lake shore. The Very Young Man\nwore, underneath his robe, a close-fitting knitted garment very much\nlike a bathing-suit. He took off his robe now, and rolling it up, tied\nit across his back with the cord he had worn around his waist. Aura's\ntunic was too short to impede her swimming and when the Very Young Man\nwas ready, they waded out into the water together. They found the lake\nno deeper than to Aura's shoulders, but as it was easier to swim than to\nwade, they began swimming--away from shore towards the farthest boat\nthat evidently was headed for Orlog.\n\nThe Very Young Man thought with satisfaction that, with only their heads\nvisible, huge as they would appear, they could probably reach this boat\nwithout being seen by any one in Orlog. The boat was perhaps a quarter\nof a mile from them--a tiny little toy vessel, it seemed, that they\nnever would have seen except for its sail.\n\nThey came up to it rapidly, for they were swimming very much faster than\nit could sail, passing close to one of the others and nearly swamping it\nby the waves they made. As they neared the boat they were pursuing--it\nwas different from any the Very Young Man had seen so far, a single,\ncanoe-shaped hull, with out-riders on both sides--they could see it held\nbut a single occupant, a man who sat in its stern--a figure about as\nlong as one of the Very Young Man's fingers.\n\nThe Very Young Man and Aura were swimming side by side, now. The water\nwas perfect in temperature--neither too hot nor too cold; they had not\nbeen swimming fast, and were not winded.\n\n\"We've got him, what'll we do with him,\" the Very Young Man wanted to\nknow in dismay, as the thought occurred to him. He might have been more\npuzzled at how to take the drug to make them smaller while they were\nswimming, but Aura's answer solved both problems.\n\n\"There is an island,\" she said flinging an arm up out of the water. \"We\ncan push the boat to it, and him we can leave there. Is that not the\nthing to do?\"\n\n\"You bet your life,\" the Very Young Man agreed, enthusiastically.\n\"That's just the thing to do.\"\n\nAs they came within reach of the boat the Very Young Man stopped\nswimming and found that the water was not much deeper than his waist.\nThe man in the boat appeared now about to throw himself into the lake\nfrom fright.\n\n\"Tell him, Aura,\" the Very Young Man said. \"We won't hurt him.\"\n\nWading through the water, they pushed the boat with its terrified\noccupant carefully in front of them towards the island, which was not\nmore than two or three hundred yards away. The Very Young Man found this\nrather slow work; becoming impatient, he seized the boat in his hand,\npinning the man against its seat with his forefinger so he would not\nfall out. Then raising the boat out of the water over his head he waded\nforward much more rapidly.\n\nThe island, which they reached in a few moments more, was circular in\nshape, and about fifty feet in diameter. It had a beach entirely around\nit; a hill perhaps ten feet high rose near its center, and at one end it\nwas heavily wooded. There were no houses to be seen.\n\nThe Very Young Man set the boat back on the water, and they pushed it up\non the beach. When it grounded the tiny man leaped out and ran swiftly\nalong the sand. The Very Young Man and Aura laughed heartily as they\nstood ankle-deep in the water beside the boat, watching him. For nearly\nfive minutes he ran; then suddenly he ducked inland and disappeared in\nthe woods.\n\nWhen they were left alone they lost no time in becoming normal Oroid\nsize. The boat now appeared about twenty-five feet long--a narrow,\ncanoe-shaped hull hollowed out of a tree-trunk. They climbed into it,\nand with a long pole they found lying in its bottom, the Very Young Man\nshoved it off the beach.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\nWORD MUSIC\n\n\nThe boat had a mast stepped near the bow, and a triangular cloth sail.\nThe Very Young Man sat in the stern, steering with a short, broad-bladed\npaddle; Aura lay on a pile of rushes in the bottom of the boat, looking\nup at him.\n\nFor about half a mile the Very Young Man sailed along parallel with the\nbeach, looking for the man they had marooned. He was nowhere in sight,\nand they finally headed out into the lake towards Orlog, which they\ncould just see dimly on the further shore.\n\nThe breeze was fresh, and they made good time. The boat steered easily,\nand the Very Young Man, reclining on one elbow, with Aura at his feet,\nfelt at peace with himself and with the world. Again he thought this\ngirl the prettiest he had ever seen. There was something, too, of a\nspiritual quality in the delicate smallness of her features--a sweetness\nof expression in her quick, understanding smile, and an honest clearness\nin her steady gaze that somehow he seemed never to have seen in a girl's\nface before.\n\nHe felt again, now that he had time to think more of her, that same old\ndiffidence that had come to him before when they were alone in the\nstoreroom of her home. That she did not share this feeling was obvious\nfrom the frankness and ease of her manner.\n\nFor some time after leaving the island neither spoke. The Very Young Man\nfelt the girl's eyes fixed almost constantly upon him--a calm gaze that\nheld in it a great curiosity and wonderment. He steered steadily onward\ntowards Orlog. There was, for the moment, nothing to discuss concerning\ntheir adventure, and he wondered what he should say to this girl who\nstared at him so frankly. Then he met her eyes, and again she smiled\nwith that perfect sense of comradeship he had so seldom felt with women\nof his own race.\n\n\"You're very beautiful,\" said the Very Young Man abruptly.\n\nThe girl's eyes widened a little, but she did not drop her lashes. \"I\nwant to be beautiful; if you think it is so, I am very glad.\"\n\n\"I do. I think you're the prettiest girl I ever saw.\" He blurted out the\nwords impetuously. He was very earnest, very sincere, and very young.\n\nA trace of coquetry came into the girl's manner. \"Prettier than the\ngirls of your world? Are they not pretty?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes--of course; but----\"\n\n\"What?\" she asked when he paused.\n\nThe Very Young Man considered a moment. \"You're--you're different,\" he\nsaid finally. She waited. \"You--you don't know how to flirt, for one\nthing.\"\n\nThe girl turned her head away and looked at him a little sidewise\nthrough lowered lashes.\n\n\"How do you know that?\" she asked demurely; and the Very Young Man\nadmitted to himself with a shock of surprise that he certainly was\ntotally wrong in that deduction at least.\n\n\"Tell me of the girls in your world,\" she went on after a moment's\nsilence. \"My sister's husband many times he has told me of the wonderful\nthings up there in that great land. But more I would like to hear.\"\n\nHe told her, with an eloquence and enthusiasm born of youth, about his\nown life and those of his people. She questioned eagerly and with an\nintelligence that surprised him, for she knew far more of the subject\nthan he realized.\n\n\"These girls of your country,\" she interrupted him once. \"They, too, are\nvery beautiful; they wear fine clothes--I know--my brother he has told\nme.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the Very Young Man.\n\n\"And are they very learned--very clever--do they work and govern, like\nthe men?\"\n\n\"Some are very learned. And they are beginning to govern, like the men;\nbut not so much as you do here.\"\n\nThe girl's forehead wrinkled. \"My brother he once told me,\" she said\nslowly, \"that in your world many women are bad. Is that so?\"\n\n\"Some are, of course. And some men think that most are. But I don't; I\nthink women are splendid.\"\n\n\"If that is so, then better I can understand what I have heard,\" the\ngirl answered thoughtfully. \"If Oroid women were as I have heard my\nbrother talk of some of yours, this world of ours would soon be full of\nevil.\"\n\n\"You are different,\" the Very Young Man said quickly. \"You--and Lylda.\"\n\n\"The women here, they have kept the evil out of life,\" the girl went on.\n\"It is their duty--their responsibility to their race. Your good\nwomen--they have not always governed as we have. Why is that?\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" the Very Young Man admitted. \"Except because the men\nwould not let them.\"\n\n\"Why not, if they are just as learned as the men?\" The girl was\nsmiling--a little roguish, twisted smile.\n\n\"There are very clever girls,\" the Very Young Man went on hastily; he\nfound himself a little on the defensive, and he did not know just why.\n\"They are able to do things in the world. But--many men do not like\nthem.\"\n\nAura was smiling openly now, and her eyes twinkled with mischief.\n\"Perhaps it is the men are jealous. Could that not be so?\"\n\nThe Very Young Man did not answer, and the girl went on more seriously.\n\"The women of my race, they are very just. Perhaps you know that, Jack.\nOften has my brother told us of his own great world and of its problems.\nAnd the many things he has told us--Lylda and I--we have often wondered.\nFor every question has its other side, and we cannot judge--from him\nalone.\"\n\nThe Very Young Man, surprised at the turn their conversation had taken,\nand confused a little by this calm logic from a girl--particularly from\nso young and pretty a girl--was at a loss how to go on.\n\n\"You cannot understand, Aura,\" he finally said seriously. \"Women may be\nall kinds; some are bad--some are good. Down here I know it is not that\nway. Sometimes when a girl is smart she thinks she is smarter than any\nliving man. You would not like that sort of girl would you?\"\n\n\"My brother never said it just that way,\" she answered with equal\nseriousness. \"No, that would be bad--very bad. In our land women are\nonly different from men. They know they are not better or worse--only\ndifferent.\"\n\nThe Very Young Man was thinking of a girl he once knew. \"I hate clever\ngirls,\" he blurted out.\n\nAura's eyes were teasing him again. \"I am so sorry,\" she said sadly.\n\nThe Very Young Man looked his surprise. \"Why are you sorry?\"\n\n\"My sister, she once told me I was clever. My brother said it, too, and\nI believed them.\"\n\nThe Very Young Man flushed.\n\n\"You're different,\" he repeated.\n\n\"How--different?\" She was looking at him sidewise again.\n\n\"I don't know; I've been trying to think--but you are. And I don't hate\nyou--I like you--very, very much.\"\n\n\"I like you, too,\" she answered frankly, and the Very Young Man thought\nof Loto as she said it. He was leaning down towards her, and their hands\nmet for an instant.\n\nThe Very Young Man had spread his robe out to dry when he first got into\nthe boat, and now he put it on while Aura steered. Then he sat beside\nher on the seat, taking the paddle again.\n\n\"Do you go often to the theater?\" she asked after a time.\n\n\"Oh, yes, often.\"\n\n\"Nothing like that do we have here,\" she added, a little wistfully.\n\"Only once, when we played a game in the field beyond my brother's home.\nLylda was the queen and I her lady. And do you go to the opera, too? My\nbrother he has told me of the opera. How wonderful must that be! So\nbeautiful--more beautiful even it must be than Lylda's music. But never\nshall it be for me.\" She smiled sadly: \"Never shall I be able to hear\nit.\"\n\nAn eager contradiction sprang to the Very Young Man's lips, but the girl\nshook her head quietly.\n\nFor several minutes they did not speak. The wind behind them blew the\ngirl's long hair forward over her shoulders. A lock of it fell upon the\nVery Young Man's hand as it lay on the seat between them, and unseen he\ntwisted it about his fingers. The wind against his neck felt warm and\npleasant; the murmur of the water flowing past sounded low and sweet and\nsoothing. Overhead the stars hung very big and bright. It was like\nsailing on a perfect night in his own world. He was very conscious of\nthe girl's nearness now--conscious of the clinging softness of her hair\nabout his fingers. And all at once he found himself softly quoting some\nhalf-forgotten lines:\n\n    \"If I were king, ah, love! If I were king\n    What tributary nations I would bring\n    To bow before your scepter and to swear\n    Allegiance to your lips and eyes and hair.\"\n\nAura's questioning glance of surprise brought him to himself. \"That is\nso pretty--what is that?\" she asked eagerly. \"Never have I heard one\nspeak like that before.\"\n\n\"Why, that's poetry; haven't you ever heard any poetry?\"\n\nThe girl shook her head. \"It's just like music--it sings. Do it again.\"\n\nThe Very Young Man suddenly felt very self-conscious.\n\n\"Do it again--please.\" She looked pleadingly up into his face and the\nVery Young Man went on:\n\n    \"Beneath your feet what treasures I would fling!\n    The stars would be your pearls upon a string;\n    The world a ruby for your finger-ring;\n      And you could have the sun and moon to wear\n      If I were king.\"\n\nThe girl clapped her hands artlessly. \"Oh, that is so pretty. Never did\nI know that words could sound like that. Say it some more, please.\"\n\nAnd the Very Young Man, sitting under the stars beside this beautiful\nlittle creature of another world, searched into his memory and for her\nwho never before had known that words could rhyme, opened up the realm\nof poetry.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\nTHE PALACE OF ORLOG\n\n\nEngrossed with each other the Very Young Man and Aura sailed close up to\nthe water-front of Orlog before they remembered their situation. It was\nthe Very Young Man who first became aware of the danger. Without\nexplanation he suddenly pulled Aura into the bottom of the boat, leaving\nit to flutter up into the wind unguided.\n\n\"They might see us from here,\" he said hurriedly. \"We must decide what\nis best for us to do now.\"\n\nThey were then less than a quarter of a mile from the stone quay that\nmarked the city's principal landing-place. Nearer to them was a broad,\nsandy beach behind which, in a long string along the lake shore, lay the\ncity. Its houses were not unlike those of Arite, although most of them\nwere rather smaller and less pretentious. On a rise of ground just\nbeyond the beach, and nearly in front of them, stood an elaborate\nbuilding that was Targo's palace.\n\n\"We daren't go much closer,\" the Very Young Man said. \"They'd recognize\nus.\"\n\n\"You they would know for one of the strangers,\" said Aura. \"But if I\nshould steer and you were hidden no one would notice.\"\n\nThe Very Young Man realized a difficulty. \"We've got to be very small\nwhen we go into the city.\"\n\n\"How small would you think?\" asked Aura.\n\nThe Very Young Man held his hands about a foot apart. \"You see, the\ntrouble is, we must be small enough to get around without too much\ndanger of being seen; but if we get too small it would be a terrible\nwalk up there to Targo's palace.\"\n\n\"We cannot sail this boat if we are such a size,\" Aura declared. \"Too\nlarge it would be for us to steer.\"\n\n\"That's just it, but we can't go any closer this way.\"\n\nAura thought a moment. \"If you lie there,\" she indicated the bottom of\nthe boat under a forward seat, \"no one can see. And I will steer--there\nto the beach ahead; me they will not notice. Then at the beach we will\ntake the drug.\"\n\n\"We've got to take a chance,\" said the Very Young Man. \"Some one may\ncome along and see us getting small.\"\n\nThey talked it over very carefully for some time. Finally they decided\nto follow Aura's plan and run the boat to the beach under her guidance;\nthen to take the drug. There were few people around the lake front at\nthis hour; the beach itself, as far as they could see, was entirely\ndeserted, and the danger of discovery seemed slight. Aura pointed out,\nhowever, that once on shore, if their stature were so great as a foot\nthey would be even more conspicuous than when of normal size even\nallowing for the strangeness of the Very Young Man's appearance. The\nVery Young Man made a calculation and reached the conclusion that with a\nheight of six or seven inches they would have to walk about a mile from\nthe landing-place to reach Targo's palace. They decided to become as\nnear that size as they conveniently could.\n\nWhen both fully understood what they intended to do, the Very Young Man\ngave Aura one of the pellets of the drug and lay down in the bow of the\nboat. Without a word the girl took her seat in the stern and steered for\nthe beach. When they were close inshore Aura signalled her companion and\nat the same moment both took the drug. Then she left her seat and lay\ndown beside the Very Young Man. The boat, from the momentum it had\ngained, floated inshore and grounded gently on the beach.\n\nAs they lay there, the Very Young Man could see the sides of the boat\ngrowing up steadily above their heads. The gunwale was nearly six feet\nabove them before he realized a new danger. Scrambling to his feet he\npulled the girl up with him; even when standing upright their heads came\nbelow the sides of the vessel.\n\n\"We've got to get out right now,\" the Very Young Man said in an excited\nwhisper. \"We'd be too small.\" He led the girl hastily into the bow and\nwith a running leap clambered up and sat astride the gunwale. Then,\nreaching down he pulled Aura up beside him.\n\nIn a moment they had dropped overboard up to their shoulders in the\nwater. High overhead loomed the hull of the boat--a large sailing vessel\nit seemed to them now. They started wading towards shore immediately,\nbut, because they were so rapidly diminishing in size, it was nearly\nfive minutes before they could get there.\n\nOnce on shore they lay prone upon the sand, waiting for the drug to\ncease its action. When, by proper administering of both chemicals, they\nhad reached approximately their predetermined stature, which, in itself,\nrequired considerable calculation on the Very Young Man's part, they\nstood up near the water's edge and looked about them.\n\nThe beach to them now, with its coarse-grained sand, seemed nearly a\nquarter of a mile wide; in length it extended as far as they could see\nin both directions. Beyond the beach, directly in front of them on a\nhill perhaps a thousand feet above the lake level, and about a mile or\nmore away, stood Targo's palace. To the Very Young Man it looked far\nlarger than any building he had ever seen.\n\nThe boat in which they had landed lay on the water with its bow on the\nbeach beside them. It was now a vessel some two hundred and fifty feet\nin length, with sides twenty feet high and a mast towering over a\nhundred feet in the air.\n\nThere was no one in sight from where they stood. \"Come on, Aura,\" said\nthe Very Young Man, and started off across the beach towards the hill.\n\nIt was a long walk through the heavy sand to the foot of the hill. When\nthey arrived they found themselves at the beginning of a broad stone\nroadway--only a path to those of normal Oroid size--that wound back and\nforth up the hill to the palace. They walked up this road, and as they\nprogressed, saw that it was laid through a grassy lawn that covered the\nentire hillside--a lawn with gray-blue blades of grass half as high as\ntheir bodies.\n\nAfter walking about ten minutes they came to a short flight of steps.\nEach step was twice as high as their heads--impossible of ascent--so\nthey made a detour through the grass.\n\nSuddenly Aura clutched the Very Young Man by the arm with a whispered\nexclamation, and they both dropped to the ground. A man was coming down\nthe roadway; he was just above the steps when they first saw him--a man\nso tall that, standing beside him, they would have reached hardly above\nhis ankles. The long grass in which they were lying hid them effectually\nfrom his sight and he passed them by unnoticed. When he was gone the\nVery Young Man drew a long breath. \"We must watch that,\" he said\napprehensively. \"If any one sees us now it's all off. We must be\nextremely careful.\"\n\nIt took the two adventurers over an hour to get safely up the hill and\ninto the palace. Its main entrance, approached by a long flight of\nsteps, was an impossible means of ingress, but Aura fortunately knew of\na smaller door at the side which led into the basement of the building.\nThis door they found slightly ajar. It was open so little, however, that\nthey could not get past, and as they were not strong enough even with\ntheir combined efforts, to swing the door open, they were again brought\nto a halt.\n\n\"We'd better get still smaller,\" the Very Young Man whispered somewhat\nnervously. \"There's less danger that way.\"\n\nThey reduced their size, perhaps one half, and when that was\naccomplished the crack in the door had widened sufficiently to let them\nin. Within the building they found themselves in a hallway several\nhundred feet wide and half a mile or more in length--its ceiling high as\nthe roof of some great auditorium. The Very Young Man looked about in\ndismay. \"Great Scott,\" he ejaculated, \"this won't do at all.\"\n\n\"Many times I have been here,\" said Aura. \"It looks so very different\nnow, but I think I know the way.\"\n\n\"That may be,\" agreed the Very Young Man dubiously, \"but we'd have to\nwalk miles if we stay as small as this.\"\n\nA heavy tread sounded far away in the distance. The Very Young Man and\nAura shrank back against the wall, close by the door. In a moment a\nman's feet and the lower part of his legs came into view. He stopped by\nthe door, pulling it inward. The Very Young Man looked up into the air;\na hundred and fifty feet, perhaps, above their heads he saw the man's\nface looking out through the doorway.\n\nIn a moment another man joined him, coming from outside, and they spoke\ntogether for a time. Their roaring voices, coming down from this great\nheight, were nevertheless distinctly audible.\n\n\"In the audience room,\" Aura whispered, after listening an instant,\n\"Targo's younger brother talks with his counsellors. Big things they are\nplanning.\" The Very Young Man did not answer; the two men continued\ntheir brief conversation and parted.\n\nWhen the Very Young Man and Aura were left alone, he turned to the girl\neagerly. \"Did they mention Loto? Is he here?\"\n\n\"Of him they did not speak,\" Aura answered. \"It is best that we go to\nthe audience room, where they are talking. Then, perhaps, we will know.\"\nThe Very Young Man agreed, and they started off.\n\nFor nearly half an hour they trudged onward along this seemingly endless\nhallway. Then again they were confronted with a flight of steps--this\ntime steps that were each more than three times their own height.\n\n\"We've got to chance it,\" said the Very Young Man, and after listening\ncarefully and hearing no one about, they again took the drug, making\nthemselves sufficiently large to ascend these steps to the upper story\nof the building.\n\nIt was nearly an hour before the two intruders, after several narrow\nescapes from discovery, and by alternating doses of both drugs,\nsucceeded in getting into the room where Targo's brother and his\nadvisers were in conference.\n\nThey entered through the open door--a doorway so wide that a hundred\nlike them could have marched through it abreast. A thousand feet away\nacross the vastness of the room they could see Targo's brother and ten\nof his men--sitting on mats upon the floor, talking earnestly. Before\nthem stood a stone bench on which were a number of golden goblets and\nplates of food.\n\nThe adventurers ran swiftly down the length of the room, following its\nwall. It echoed with their footfalls, but they knew that this sound, so\nloud to their ears, would be inaudible to the huge figures they were\napproaching.\n\n\"They won't see us,\" whispered the Very Young Man, \"let's get up close.\"\nAnd in a few moments more they were standing beside one of the figures,\nsheltered from sight by a corner of the mat upon which the man was\nsitting. His foot, bent sidewise under him upon the floor, was almost\nwithin reach of the Very Young Man's hand. The fibre thong that fastened\nits sandal looked like a huge rope thick as the Very Young Man's ankle,\nand each of its toes were half as long as his entire body.\n\nTargo's brother, a younger man than those with him, appeared to be doing\nmost of the talking. He it was beside whom Aura and the Very Young Man\nwere standing.\n\n\"You tell me if they mention Loto,\" whispered the Very Young Man. Aura\nnodded and they stood silent, listening. The men all appeared deeply\nengrossed with what their leader was saying. The Very Young Man,\nwatching his companion's face, saw an expression of concern and fear\nupon it. She leaned towards him.\n\n\"In Arite, to-night,\" she whispered, \"Targo is organizing men to attack\nthe palace of the king. Him will they kill--then Targo will be\nproclaimed leader of all the Oroid nation.\"\n\n\"We must get back,\" the Very Young Man answered in an anxious whisper.\n\"I wish we knew where Loto was; haven't they mentioned him--or any of\nus?\"\n\nAura did not reply, and the Very Young Man waited silent. Once one of\nthe men laughed--a laugh that drifted out into the immense distances of\nthe room in great waves of sound. Aura gripped her companion by the arm.\n\n\"Then when Targo rules the land, they will send a messenger to my\nbrother. Him they will tell that the drugs must be given to Targo, or\nLoto will be killed--wait--when they have the drugs,\" Aura translated in\na swift, tense whisper, \"then all of us they will kill.\" She shuddered.\n\"And with the drugs they will rule as they desire--for evil.\"\n\n\"They'll never get them,\" the Very Young Man muttered.\n\nTargo's brother leaned forward and raised a goblet from the table. The\nmovement of his foot upon the floor made the two eavesdroppers jump\naside to avoid being struck.\n\nAgain Aura grasped her companion by the arm. \"He is saying Loto is\nupstairs,\" she whispered after a moment. \"I know where.\"\n\n\"I knew it,\" said the Very Young Man exultingly. \"You take us there.\nCome on--let's get out of here--we mustn't waste a minute.\"\n\nThey started back towards the wall nearest them--some fifty feet\naway--and following along its edge, ran down towards the doorway through\nwhich they had entered the room. They were still perhaps a hundred yards\naway from it, running swiftly, when there appeared in the doorway the\nfeet and legs of two men who were coming in. The Very Young Man and Aura\nstopped abruptly, shrinking up against the side of the wall. Then there\ncame a heavy metallic clanging sound; the two men entered the room,\nclosing the door.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\nAN ANT-HILL OUTRAGED\n\n\n\"We'll have to get smaller,\" said the Doctor.\n\n\"There's Rogers' house.\"\n\nThey had been walking along the beach from the king's palace hardly more\nthan a hundred yards. The Doctor and the Big Business Man were in front,\nand Oteo, wide-eyed and solemn, was close behind them.\n\nThe Doctor was pointing down at the ground a few feet ahead. There, at a\nheight just above their ankles, stood the Chemist's house--a little\nbuilding whose roof did not reach more than half-way to their knees,\neven though it stood on higher ground than the beach upon which they\nwere walking. On the roof they could see two tiny figures--the Chemist\nand Lylda--waving their arms.\n\nThe Big Business Man stopped short. \"Now see here, Frank, let's\nunderstand this. We've been fooling with this thing too damned long.\nWe've made a hell of a mess of it, you know that.\" He spoke\ndeterminedly, with a profanity unusual with him. The Doctor did not\nanswer.\n\n\"We got here--yesterday. We found a peaceful world. Dissatisfaction in\nit--yes. But certainly a more peaceful world than the one we left. We've\nbeen here one day--one day, Frank, and now look at things. This child,\nLoto--stolen. Jack disappeared--God knows what's happened to him. A\nrevolution--the whole place in an uproar. All in one day, since we took\nour place in this world and tried to mix up in its affairs.\n\n\"It's time to call a halt, Frank. If only we can get Jack back. That's\nthe bad part--we've got to find Jack. And then get out; we don't belong\nhere anyway. It's nothing to us--why, man, look at it.\" He waved his arm\nout over the city. In the street beside them they could see a number of\nlittle figures no bigger than their fingers, staring up into the air.\n\"What is all that to us now, as we stand here. Nothing. Nothing but a\nkid's toy; with little animated mannikins for a child to play with.\"\n\n\"We've got to find Jack,\" said the Doctor.\n\n\"Certainly we have--and then get out. We're only hurting these little\ncreatures, anyway, by being here.\"\n\n\"But there's Rogers and Lylda,\" added the Doctor. \"And Loto and Lylda's\nsister.\"\n\n\"Take them with us. They'll have to go--they can't stay here now. But we\nmust find Jack--that's the main thing.\"\n\n\"Look,\" the Doctor said, moving forward. \"They're shouting to us.\"\n\nThey walked up and bent over the Chemist's house. Their friend was\nmaking a funnel of his hands and trying to attract their attention. The\nBig Business Man knelt upon the beach and put his head down beside the\nhouse. \"Make yourselves smaller,\" he heard the Chemist shouting in a\nshrill little voice.\n\n\"We think it best not to. You must come up to us. Serious things have\nhappened. Take the drug now--then we'll tell you.\" The Big Business Man,\nwith his knees upon the beach, had one hand on the sand and the other at\nthe gate of Lylda's garden. His face was just above the roof-top.\n\nThe two little figures consulted a moment; then the Chemist shouted up,\n\"All right; wait,\" and he and Lylda disappeared into the house. A moment\nafterwards they reappeared in the garden; Eena was with them. They\ncrossed the garden and turned into the street towards the flight of\nsteps that led down to the lake.\n\nThe Big Business Man had regained his feet and was standing ankle-deep\nin the water talking to the Doctor when Oteo suddenly plucked at his\nsleeve.\n\n\"The Master--\" he cried. The youth was staring down into the street,\nwith a look of terror on his face. The Big Business Man followed the\ndirection of his glance; at the head of the steps a number of men had\nrushed upon the Chemist and the two women, and were dragging them back\nup the hill. The Big Business Man hesitated only a moment; then he\nreached down and plucking a little figure from one of the struggling\ngroups, flung it back over his shoulder into the lake.\n\nThe other assailants did not run, as he had expected, so he gently pried\nthem apart with his fingers from their captives, and, one by one, flung\nthem into the air behind him. One who struck Lylda, he squashed upon the\nflagstones of the street with his thumb.\n\nOnly one escaped. He had been holding Eena; when he saw he was the last,\nhe suddenly dropped his captive and ran shrieking up the hill into the\ncity.\n\nThe Big Business Man laughed grimly, and got upon his feet a little\nunsteadily. His face was white.\n\n\"You see, Frank,\" he said, and his voice trembled a little. \"Good God,\nsuppose we had been that size, too.\"\n\nIn a few moments more the Chemist, Lylda and Eena had taken the drug and\nwere as large as the others. All six stood in the water beside the\nChemist's house. The Chemist had not spoken while he was growing; now he\ngreeted his friends quietly. \"A close call, gentlemen. I thank you.\" He\nsmiled approvingly at the Big Business Man.\n\nEena and Oteo stood apart from the others. The girl was obviously\nterror-stricken by the experiences she had undergone. Oteo put his arm\nacross her shoulders, and spoke to her reassuringly.\n\n\"Where is Jack?\" Lylda asked anxiously. \"And my father--and Aura?\" The\nBig Business Man thought her face looked years older than when he had\nlast seen it. Her expression was set and stern, but her eyes stared into\nhis with a gentle, sorrowful gaze that belied the sternness of her lips.\n\nThey told her, as gently as they could, of the death of her father and\nthe disappearance of the Very Young Man, presumably with Aura. She bore\nup bravely under the news of her father's death, standing with her hand\non her husband's arm, and her sorrowful eyes fixed upon the face of the\nBig Business Man who haltingly told what had befallen them. When he came\nto a description of the attack on the palace, the death of the king, and\nthe triumph of Targo, the Chemist raised his hands with a hopeless\ngesture.\n\nThe Doctor put in: \"It's a serious situation--most serious.\"\n\n\"There's only one thing we can do,\" the Big Business Man added quickly.\n\"We must find Jack and your sister,\" he addressed Lylda, whose eyes had\nnever left his face, \"and then get out of this world as quickly as we\ncan--before we do it any more harm.\"\n\nThe Chemist began pacing up and down the strip of the beach. He had\nevidently reached the same conclusion--that it was hopeless to continue\nlonger to cope with so desperate a situation. But he could not bring\nhimself so easily to a realization that his life in this world, of which\nhe had been so long virtually the leader, was at an end. He strode back\nand forth thinking deeply; the water that he kicked idly splashed up\nsometimes over the houses of the tiny city at his side.\n\nThe Big Business Man went on, \"It's the only way--the best way for all\nof us and for this little world, too.\"\n\n\"The best way for you--and you.\" Lylda spoke softly and with a sweet,\ngentle sadness. \"It is best for you, my friends. But for me----\" She\nshook her head.\n\nThe Big Business Man laid his hands gently on her shoulders. \"Best for\nyou, too, little woman. And for these people you love so well. Believe\nme--it is.\"\n\nThe Chemist paused in his walk. \"Probably Aura and Jack are together. No\nharm has come to them so far--that's certain. If his situation were\ndesperate he would have made himself as large as we are and we would see\nhim.\"\n\n\"If he got the chance,\" the Doctor murmured.\n\n\"Certainly he has not been killed or captured,\" the Chemist reasoned,\n\"for we would have other giants to face immediately that happened.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he took the girl with him and started off to Orlog to find\nLoto,\" suggested the Doctor. \"That crazy boy might do anything.\"\n\n\"He should be back by now, even if he had,\" said the Big Business Man.\n\"I don't see how anything could happen to him--having those----\" He\nstopped abruptly.\n\nWhile they had been talking a crowd of little people had gathered in the\ncity beside them--a crowd that thronged the street before the Chemist's\nhouse, filled the open space across from it and overflowed down the\nsteps leading to the beach. It was uncanny, standing there, to see these\nswarming little creatures, like ants whose hill had been desecrated by\nthe foot of some stray passer-by. They were enraged, and with an ant's\nunreasoning, desperate courage they were ready to fight and to die,\nagainst an enemy irresistibly strong.\n\n\"Good God, look at them,\" murmured the Big Business Man in awe.\n\nThe steps leading to the beach were black with them now--a swaying,\nstruggling mass of little human forms, men and women, hardly a finger's\nlength in height, coming down in a steady stream and swarming out upon\nthe beach. In a few moments the sand was black with them, and always\nmore appeared in the city above to take their places.\n\nThe Big Business Man felt a sharp sting in his foot above the sandal.\nOne of the tiny figures was clinging to its string and sticking a sword\ninto his flesh. Involuntarily he kicked; a hundred of the little\ncreatures were swept aside, and when he put his foot back upon the sand\nhe could feel them smash under his tread. Their faint, shrill, squeaking\nshrieks had a ghostly semblance to human voices, and he turned suddenly\nsick and faint.\n\nThen he glanced at Lylda's face; it bore an expression of sorrow and of\nhorror that made him shudder. To him at first these had been savage,\nvicious little insects, annoying, but harmless enough if one kept upon\none's feet; but to her, he knew, they were men and women--misguided,\nfrenzied--but human, thinking beings like herself. And he found himself\nwondering, vaguely, what he should do to repel them.\n\nThe attack was so unexpected, and came so quickly that the giants had\nstood motionless, watching it with awe. Before they realized their\nsituation the sand was so crowded with the struggling little figures\nthat none of them could stir without trampling upon scores.\n\nOteo and Eena, standing ankle-deep in the water, were unattacked, and at\na word from the Chemist the others joined them, leaving little heaps of\nmangled human forms upon the beach where they had trod.\n\nAll except Lylda. She stood her ground--her face bloodless, her eyes\nfilled with tears. Her feet were covered now; her ankles bleeding from a\ndozen tiny knives hacking at her flesh. The Chemist called her to him,\nbut she only raised her arms with a gesture of appeal.\n\n\"Oh, my husband,\" she cried. \"Please, I must. Let me take the drug now\nand grow small--like them. Then will they see we mean them no harm. And\nI shall tell them we are their friends--and you, the Master, mean only\ngood----\"\n\nThe Big Business Man started forward. \"They'll kill her. God,\nthat's----\" But the Chemist held them back.\n\n\"Not now, Lylda,\" he said gently. \"Not now. Don't you see? There's\nnothing you can do; it's too late now.\" He met her gaze unyielding. For\na moment she stared; then her figure swayed and with a low sob she\ndropped in a heap upon the sand.\n\nAs Lylda fell, the Chemist leaped forward, the other three men at his\nside. A strident cry came up from the swarming multitude, and in an\ninstant hundreds of them were upon her, climbing over her and thrusting\ntheir swords into her body.\n\nThe Chemist and the Big Business Man picked her up and carried her into\nthe water, brushing off the fighting little figures that still clung to\nher. There they laid her down, her head supported by Eena, who knelt in\nthe water beside her mistress.\n\nThe multitude on the sand crowded up to the water's edge; hundreds,\nforced forward by the pressure of those behind, plunged in, swam about,\nor sank and were rolled back by the surf, lifeless upon the shore. The\nbeach crawled with their struggling forms, only the spot where Lylda had\nfallen was black and still.\n\n\"She's all right,\" said the Doctor after a moment, bending over Lylda. A\ncry from Oteo made him straighten up quickly. Out over the horizon,\ntowards Orlog, there appeared the dim shape of a gigantic human form,\nand behind it others, faint and blurred against the stars!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\nTHE RESCUE OF LOTO\n\n\nThe Very Young Man heard the clang of the closing door with sinking\nheart. The two newcomers, passing close to him and Aura as they stood\nshrinking up against the wall, joined their friends at the table. The\nVery Young Man turned to Aura with a solemn face.\n\n\"Are there any other doors?\" he asked.\n\nThe girl pointed. \"One other, there--but see, it, too, is closed.\"\n\nFar across the room the Very Young Man could make out a heavy metal door\nsimilar to that through which they had entered. It was closed--he could\nsee that plainly. And to open it--so huge a door that its great golden\nhandle hung nearly a hundred feet above them--was an utter\nimpossibility.\n\nThe Very Young Man looked at the windows. There were four of them, all\non one side of the room--enormous curtained apertures, two hundred feet\nin length and half as broad--but none came even within fifty feet of the\nfloor. The Very Young Man realized with dismay that there was apparently\nno way of escape out of the room.\n\n\"We can't get out, Aura,\" he said, and in spite of him his voice\ntrembled. \"There's no way.\"\n\nThe girl had no answer but a quiet nod of agreement. Her face was\nserious, but there was on it no sign of panic. The Very Young Man\nhesitated a moment; then he started off down the room towards one of the\ndoors, with Aura close at his side.\n\nThey could not get out in their present size, he knew. Nor would they\ndare make themselves sufficiently large to open the door, or climb\nthrough one of the windows, even if the room had been nearer the ground\nthan it actually was. Long before they could escape they would be\ndiscovered and seized.\n\nThe Very Young Man tried to think it out clearly. He knew, except for a\npossible accident, or a miscalculation on his part, that they were in no\nreal danger. But he did not want to make a false move, and now for the\nfirst time he realized his responsibility to Aura, and began to regret\nthe rashness of his undertaking.\n\nThey could wait, of course, until the conference was over, and then slip\nout unnoticed. But the Very Young Man felt that the chances of their\nrescuing Loto were greater now than they would be probably at any time\nin the future. They must get out now, he was convinced of that. But how?\n\nThey were at the door in a moment more. Standing so close it seemed,\nnow, a tremendous shaggy walling of shining metal. They walked its\nlength, and then suddenly the Very Young Man had an idea. He threw\nhimself face down upon the floor. Underneath the door's lower edge there\nwas a tiny crack. To one of normal Oroid size it would have been\nunnoticeable--a space hardly so great as the thickness of a thin sheet\nof paper. But the Very Young Man could see it plainly; he gauged its\nsize by slipping the edge of his robe into it.\n\nThis crack was formed by the bottom of the door and the level surface of\nthe floor; there was no sill. The door was perfectly hung, for the crack\nseemed to be of uniform size. The Very Young Man showed it to Aura.\n\n\"There's the way out,\" he whispered. \"Through there and then large again\non the other side.\"\n\nHe made his calculation of size carefully, and then, crushing one of the\npills into powder, divided a portion of it between himself and the girl.\nAura seemed tired and the drug made her very dizzy. They both sat upon\nthe stone floor, close up to the door, and closed their eyes. When, by\nthe feeling of the floor beneath them, they knew the action of the drug\nwas over, they stood up unsteadily and looked around them.\n\nThey now found themselves standing upon a great stone plain. The ground\nbeneath their feet was rough, but as far away as they could see, out up\nto the horizon, it was mathematically level. This great expanse was\nempty except in one place; over to the right there appeared a huge,\nirregular, blurred mass that might have been, by its look, a range of\nmountains. But the mass moved as they stared at it, and the Very Young\nMan knew it was the nearest one of Targo's men, sitting beside the\ntable.\n\nIn the opposite direction, perhaps a hundred yards away from where they\nwere standing, they could see the bottom of the door. It hung in the air\nsome fifty feet above the surface of the ground. They walked over and\nstood underneath; like a great roof it spread over them--a flat, level\nsurface parallel with the floor beneath.\n\nAt this extraordinary change in their surroundings Aura seemed\nfrightened, but seeing the matter-of-fact way in which her companion\nacted, she maintained her composure and soon was much interested in this\nnew aspect of things. The Very Young Man took a last careful look around\nand then, holding Aura by the hand, started to cross under the door in a\ndirection he judged to be at right angles to its length.\n\nThey walked swiftly, trying to keep their sense of direction, but having\nno means of knowing whether they were doing so or not. For perhaps ten\nminutes they walked; then they emerged on the other side of the door and\nagain faced a great level, empty expanse.\n\n\"We're under,\" the Very Young Man remarked with relief. \"Do you know\nwhere Loto is from here?\"\n\nAura had recovered her self-possession sufficiently to smile.\n\n\"I might, perhaps,\" she answered, with a pretty little shrug. \"But it's\na long way, don't you think? A hundred miles, it may be?\"\n\n\"We get large here,\" said the Very Young Man, with an answering smile.\nHe was greatly relieved to be outside the audience room; the way seemed\neasy before them now.\n\nThey took the opposite drug, and after several successive changes of\nsize, succeeded in locating the upper room in the palace in which Loto\nwas held. At this time they were about the same relative size to their\nenemies as when they entered the audience chamber on the floor below.\n\n\"That must be it,\" the Very Young Man whispered, as they cautiously\nturned a hallway corner. A short distance beyond, in front of a closed\ndoor, sat two guards.\n\n\"That is the room of which they spoke,\" Aura answered. \"Only one door\nthere is, I think.\"\n\n\"That's all right,\" said the Very Young Man confidently. \"We'll do the\nsame thing--go under the door.\"\n\nThey went close up to the guards, who were sitting upon the floor\nplaying some sort of a game with little golden balls. This door, like\nthe other, had a space beneath it, rather wider than the other, and in\nten minutes more the Very Young Man and Aura were beneath it, and inside\nthe room.\n\nAs they grew larger again the Very Young Man at first thought the room\nwas empty. \"There he is,\" cried Aura happily. The Very Young Man looked\nand could see across the still huge room, the figure of Loto, standing\nat a window opening.\n\n\"Don't let him see us till we're his size,\" cautioned the Very Young\nMan. \"It might frighten him. And if he made any noise----\" He looked at\nthe door behind them significantly.\n\nAura nodded eagerly; her face was radiant. Steadily larger they grew.\nLoto did not turn round, but stood quiet, looking out of the window.\n\nThey crept up close behind him, and when they were normal size Aura\nwhispered his name softly. The boy turned in surprise and she faced him\nwith a warning finger on her lips. He gave a low, happy little cry, and\nin another instant was in her arms, sobbing as she held him close to her\nbreast.\n\nThe Very Young Man's eyes grew moist as he watched them, and heard the\nsoft Oroid words of endearment they whispered to each other. He put his\narms around them, too, and all at once he felt very big and very strong\nbeside these two delicate, graceful little creatures of whom he was\nprotector.\n\nA noise in the hallway outside brought the Very Young Man to himself.\n\n\"We must get out,\" he said swiftly. \"There's no time to lose.\" He went\nto the window; it faced the city, fifty feet or more above the ground.\n\nThe Very Young Man make a quick decision. \"If we go out the way we came,\nit will take a very long time,\" he explained. \"And we might be seen. I\nthink we'd better take the quick way; get big here--get right out,\" he\nwaved his hands towards the roof, \"and make a run for it back to Arite.\"\n\nHe made another calculation. The room in which they were was on the top\nfloor of the palace; Aura had told him that. It was a room about fifty\nfeet in length, triangular in shape, and some thirty feet from floor to\nceiling. The Very Young Man estimated that when they had grown large\nenough to fill the room, they could burst through the palace roof and\nleap to the ground. Then in a short time they could run over the\ncountry, back to Arite. He measured out the drug carefully, and without\nhesitation his companions took what he gave them.\n\nAs they all three started growing--it was Loto's first experience, and\nhe gave an exclamation of fright at the sensation and threw his arms\naround Aura again--the Very Young Man made them sit upon the floor near\nthe center of the room. He sat himself beside them, staring up at the\nceiling that was steadily folding up and coming down towards them. For\nsome time he stared, fascinated by its ceaseless movement.\n\nThen suddenly he realized with a start that it was almost down upon\nthem. He put up his hand and touched it, and a thrill of fear ran over\nhim. He looked around. Beside him sat Aura and Loto, huddled close\ntogether. The walls of the room had nearly closed in upon them now; its\nfew pieces of furniture had been pushed aside, unnoticed, by the growth\nof their enormous bodies. It was as though they were crouching in a\ntriangular box, almost entirely filling it.\n\nThe Very Young Man laid his hand on Aura's arm, and she met his anxious\nglance with her fearless, trusting smile.\n\n\"We'll have to break through the roof now,\" whispered the Very Young\nMan, and the girl answered calmly: \"What you say to do, we will do.\"\n\nTheir heads were bent down now by the ever-lowering ceiling; the Very\nYoung Man pressed his shoulder against it and heaved upwards. He could\nfeel the floor under him quiver and the roof give beneath his thrust,\nbut he did not break through. In sudden horror he wondered if he could.\nIf he did not, soon, they would be crushed to death by their own growth\nwithin the room.\n\nThe Very Young Man knew there was still time to take the other drug. He\nshoved again, but with the same result. Their bodies were bent double\nnow. The ceiling was pressing close upon them; the walls of the room\nwere at their elbow. The Very Young Man crooked his arm through the\nlittle square orifice window that he found at his side, and, with a\nsignal to his companions, all three in unison heaved upwards with all\ntheir strength. There came one agonizing instant of resistance; then\nwith a wrenching of wood, the clatter of falling stones and a sudden\ncrash, they burst through and straightened upright into the open air\nabove.\n\nThe Very Young Man sat still for a moment, breathing hard. Overhead\nstretched the canopy of stars; around lay the city, shrunken now and\nstill steadily diminishing. Then he got unsteadily upon his feet,\npulling his companions up with him and shaking the bits of stone and\nbroken wood from him as he did so.\n\nIn a moment more the palace roof was down to their knees, and they\nstepped out of the room. They heard a cry from below and saw the two\nguards, standing amidst the debris, looking up at them through the torn\nroof in fright and astonishment.\n\nThere came other shouts from within the palace now, and the sound of the\nhurrying of many little feet. For some minutes more they grew larger, as\nthey stood upon the palace roof, clinging to one another and listening\nto the spreading cries of excitement within the building and in the city\nstreets below them.\n\n\"Come on,\" said the Very Young Man finally, and he jumped off the roof\ninto the street. A group of little figures scattered as he landed, and\nhe narrowly escaped treading upon them.\n\nSo large had they grown that it was hardly more than a step down from\nthe roof; Aura and Loto were by the Very Young Man's side in a moment,\nand immediately they started off, picking their way single file out of\nthe city. For a short time longer they continued growing; when they had\nstopped the city houses stood hardly above their ankles.\n\nIt was difficult walking, for the street was narrow and the frightened\npeople in it were often unable to avoid their tread, but fortunately the\npalace stood near the edge of the city, and soon they were past its last\nhouses and out into the open country.\n\n\"Well, we did it,\" said the Very Young Man, exulting. Then he patted\nLoto affectionately upon the shoulder, adding. \"Well, little brother, we\ngot you back, didn't we?\"\n\nAura stopped suddenly. \"Look there--at Arite,\" she said, pointing up at\nthe horizon ahead of them.\n\nFar in the distance, at the edge of the lake, and beside a dim smudge he\nknew to be the houses of Arite, the Very Young Man saw the giant figure\nof a man, huge as himself, towering up against the background of sky.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\nTHE DECISION\n\n\n\"Giants!\" exclaimed the Doctor, staring across the country towards\nOrlog. There was dismay in his voice.\n\nThe Big Business Man, standing beside him, clutched at his robe. \"How\nmany do you make out; they look like three to me.\"\n\nThe Doctor strained his eyes into the dim, luminous distance. \"Three, I\nthink--one taller than the others; it must be Jack.\" His voice was a\nlittle husky, and held none of the confidence his words were intended to\nconvey.\n\nLylda was upon her feet now, standing beside the Chemist. She stared\ntowards Orlog searchingly, then turned to him and said quietly, \"It must\nbe Jack and Aura, with Loto.\" She stopped with quivering lips; then with\nan obvious effort went on confidently. \"It cannot be that the God you\nbelieve in would let anything happen to them.\"\n\n\"They're coming this way--fast,\" said the Big Business Man. \"We'll know\nin a few moments.\"\n\nThe figures, plainly visible now against the starry background, were out\nin the open country, half a mile perhaps from the lake, and were\nevidently rapidly approaching Arite.\n\n\"If it should be Targo's men,\" the Big Business Man added, \"we must take\nmore of the drug. It is death then for them or for us.\"\n\nIn silence the six of them stood ankle deep in the water waiting. The\nmultitude of little people on the beach and in the nearby city streets\nwere dispersing now. A steady stream was flowing up the steps from the\nbeach, and back into the city. Five minutes more and only a fringe of\nthose in whom frenzy still raged remained at the water's edge; a few of\nthese, more daring, or more unreasoning than the others, plunged into\nthe lake and swam about the giants' ankles unnoticed.\n\nSuddenly Lylda gave a sigh of relief. \"Aura it is,\" she cried. \"Can you\nnot see, there at the left? Her short robe--you see--and her hair,\nflowing down so long; no man is that.\"\n\n\"You're right,\" said the Big Business Man. \"The smallest one on this\nside is Loto; I can see him. And Jack is leading. It's all right;\nthey're safe. Thank God for that; they're safe, thank God!\" The fervent\nrelief in his voice showed what a strain he had been under.\n\nIt was Jack; a moment more left no doubt of that. The Big Business Man\nturned to the Chemist and Lylda, where they stood close together, and\nlaying a hand upon the shoulder of each said with deep feeling: \"We have\nall come through it safely, my friends. And now the way lies clear\nbefore us. We must go back, out of this world, to which we have brought\nonly trouble. It is the only way; you must see that.\"\n\nLylda avoided his eyes.\n\n\"All through it safely,\" she murmured after him. \"All safe\nexcept--except my father.\" Her arm around the Chemist tightened. \"All\nsafe--except those.\" She turned her big, sorrowful eyes towards the\nbeach, where a thousand little mangled figures lay dead and dying. \"All\nsafe--except those.\"\n\nIt was only a short time before the adventurers from Orlog arrived, and\nLoto was in his mother's arms. The Very Young Man, with mixed feelings\nof pride at his exploit and relief at being freed from so grave a\nresponsibility, happily displayed Aura to his friends.\n\n\"Gosh, I'm glad we're all together again; it had me scared, that's a\nfact.\" His eye fell upon the beach. \"Great Scott, you've been having a\nfight, too? Look at that.\" The Big Business Man and the Doctor outlined\nbriefly what had happened, and the Very Young Man answered in turn with\nan account of his adventures.\n\nAura joined her sister and Loto. The Chemist after a moment stood apart\nfrom the others thinking deeply. He had said little during all the\nevents of the afternoon and evening. Now he reached the inevitable\ndecision that events had forced upon him. His face was very serious as\nhe called his companions around him.\n\n\"We must decide at once,\" he began, looking from one to the other, \"what\nwe are to do. Our situation here has become intolerable--desperate. I\nagree with you,\" his glance rested on the Big Business Man an instant;\n\"by staying here we can only do harm to these misguided people.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" the Big Business Man interjected under his breath.\n\n\"If the drugs should ever get out of our possession down here,\nimmeasurable harm would result to this world, as well as causing our own\ndeaths. If we leave now, we save ourselves; although we leave the Oroids\nruled by Targo. But without the power of the drugs, he can do only\ntemporary harm. Eventually he will be overthrown. It is the best way, I\nthink. And I am ready to leave.\"\n\n\"It's the only way,\" the Big Business Man agreed. \"Don't you think so?\"\nThe Doctor and the Very Young Man both assented.\n\n\"The sooner the better,\" the Very Young Man added. He glanced at Aura,\nand the thought that flashed into his mind made his heart jump\nviolently.\n\nThe Chemist turned to Lylda. \"To leave your people,\" he said gently, \"I\nknow how hard it is. But your way now lies with me--with us.\" He pulled\nLoto up against him as he spoke.\n\nLylda bowed her head. \"You speak true, my husband, my way does lie with\nyou. I cannot help the feeling that we should stay. But with you my way\ndoes lie; whither you direct, we shall go--for ever.\"\n\nThe Chemist kissed her tenderly. \"My sister also?\" he smiled gently at\nAura.\n\n\"My way lies with you, too,\" the girl answered simply. \"For no man here\nhas held my heart.\"\n\nThe Very Young Man stepped forward. \"Do we take them with us?\" He\nindicated Oteo and Eena, who stood silently watching.\n\n\"Ask them, Lylda,\" said the Chemist.\n\nCalling them to her, Lylda spoke to the youth and the girl in her native\ntongue. They listened quietly; Oteo with an almost expressionless\nstolidity of face, but with his soft, dog-like eyes fixed upon his\nmistress; Eena with heaving breast and trembling limbs. When Lylda\npaused they both fell upon their knees before her. She put her hands\nupon their heads and smiling wistfully, said in English:\n\n\"So it shall be; with me you shall go, because that is what you wish.\"\n\nThe Very Young Man looked around at them all with satisfaction. \"Then\nit's all settled,\" he said, and again his glance fell on Aura. He\nwondered why his heart was pounding so, and why he was so thrilled with\nhappiness; and he was glad he was able to speak in so matter-of-fact a\ntone.\n\n\"I don't know how about you,\" he added, \"but, Great Scott, I'm hungry.\"\n\n\"Since we have decided to go,\" the Chemist said, \"we had better start as\nsoon as possible. Are there things in the house, Lylda, that you care to\ntake?\"\n\nLylda shook her head. \"Nothing can I take but memories of this world,\nand those would I rather leave.\" She smiled sadly. \"There are some\nthings I would wish to do--my father----\"\n\n\"It might be dangerous to wait,\" the Big Business Man put in hurriedly.\n\"The sooner we start, the better. Another encounter would only mean more\ndeath.\" He looked significantly at the beach.\n\n\"We've got to eat,\" said the Very Young Man.\n\n\"If we handle the drugs right,\" the Chemist said, \"we can make the trip\nout in a very short time. When we get above the forest and well on our\nway we can rest safely. Let us start at once.\"\n\n\"We've got to eat,\" the Very Young Man insisted. \"And we've got to have\nfood with us.\"\n\nThe Chemist smiled. \"What you say is quite true, Jack, we have got to\nhave food and water; those are the only things necessary to our trip.\"\n\n\"We can make ourselves small now and have supper,\" suggested the Very\nYoung Man. \"Then we can fill up the bottles for our belts and take\nenough food for the trip.\"\n\n\"No, we won't,\" interposed the Big Business Man positively. \"We won't\nget small again. Something might happen. Once we get through the\ntunnels----\" He stopped abruptly.\n\n\"Great Scott! We never thought of that,\" ejaculated the Very Young Man,\nas the same thought occurred to him. \"We'll have to get small to get\nthrough the tunnels. Suppose there's a mob there that won't let us in?\"\n\n\"Is there any other way up to the forest?\" the Doctor asked.\n\nThe Chemist shook his head. \"There are a dozen different tunnels, all\nnear here, and several at Orlog, that all lead to the upper surface. But\nI think that is the only way.\"\n\n\"They might try to stop us,\" the Big Business Man suggested. \"We\ncertainly had better get through them as quickly as we possibly can.\"\n\nIt was Aura who diffidently suggested the plan they finally adopted.\nThey all reduced their size first to about the height of the Chemist's\nhouse. Then the Very Young Man prepared to make himself sufficiently\nsmall to get the food and water-bottles, and bring them up to the larger\nsize.\n\n\"Keep your eye on me,\" he warned. \"Somebody might jump on me.\"\n\nThey stood around the house, while the Very Young Man, in the garden,\ntook the drug and dwindled in stature to Oroid size. There were none of\nthe Oroids in sight, except some on the beach and others up the street\nsilently watching. As he grew smaller the Very Young Man sat down\nwearily in the wreck of what once had been Lylda's beautiful garden. He\nfelt very tired and hungry, and his head was ringing.\n\nWhen he was no longer changing size he stood up in the garden path. The\nhouse, nearly its proper dimensions once more, was close at hand, silent\nand deserted. Aura stood in the garden beside it, her shoulders pushing\naside the great branches of an overhanging tree, her arm resting upon\nthe roof-top. The Very Young Man waved up at her and shouted: \"Be out in\na minute,\" and then plunged into the house.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV\n\nGOOD-BY TO ARITE\n\n\nOnce inside he went swiftly to the room where they had left their\nwater-bottles and other paraphernalia. He found them without difficulty,\nand retraced his steps to the door he had entered. Depositing his load\nnear it, he went back towards the room which Lylda had described to him,\nand in which the food was stored.\n\nWalking along this silent hallway, listening to the echoes of his own\nfootsteps on its stone floor, the Very Young Man found himself oppressed\nby a feeling of impending danger. He looked back over his shoulder--once\nhe stood quite still and listened. But he heard nothing; the house was\nquite silent, and smiling at his own fear he went on again.\n\nSelecting the food they needed for the trip took him but a moment. He\nleft the storeroom, his arms loaded, and started back toward the garden\ndoor. Several doorways opened into the hall below, and all at once the\nVery Young Man found himself afraid as he passed them. He was within\nsight of the garden door, not more than twenty feet away, when he\nhesitated. Just ahead, at his right, an archway opened into a room\nbeside the hall. The Very Young Man paused only an instant; then,\nashamed of his fear, started slowly forward. He felt an impulse to run,\nbut he did not. And then, from out of the silence, there came a low,\ngrowling cry that made his heart stand still, and the huge gray figure\nof a man leaped upon him and bore him to the ground.\n\nAs he went down, with the packages of food flying in all directions, the\nVery Young Man gripped the naked body of his antagonist tightly. He\ntwisted round as he fell and lay with his foe partly on top of him. He\nknew instinctively that his situation was desperate. The man's huge\ntorso, with its powerful muscles that his arms encircled, told him that\nin a contest of strength such as this, inevitably he would find himself\novercome.\n\nThe man raised his fist to strike, and the Very Young Man caught him by\nthe wrist. Over his foe's shoulder now he could see the open doorway\nleading into the garden, not more than six or eight feet away. Beyond it\nlay safety; that he knew. He gave a mighty lunge and succeeded in\nrolling over toward the doorway. But he could not stay above his\nopponent, for the man's greater strength lifted him up and over, and\nagain pinned him to the floor.\n\nHe was nearer the door now, and just beyond it he caught a glimpse of\nthe white flesh of Aura's ankle as she stood beside the house. The man\nput a hand on the Very Young Man's throat. The Very Young Man caught it\nby the wrist, but he could feel the growing pressure of its fingers\ncutting off his breath. He tried to pull the hand back, but could not;\nhe tried to twist his body free, but the weight of his foe held him\ntightly against the floor. A great roaring filled his ears; the hallway\nbegan fading from his sight. With a last despairing breath, he gave a\nchoking cry: \"Aura! Aura!\"\n\nThe man's fingers at his throat loosened a little; he drew another\nbreath, and his head cleared. His eyes were fixed on the strip of garden\nhe could see beyond the doorway. Suddenly Aura's enormous body came into\nview, as she stooped and then lay prone upon the ground. Her face was\nclose to the door; she was looking in. The Very Young Man gave another\ncry, half stifled. And then into the hallway he saw come swiftly a huge\nhand, whose fingers gripped him and his antagonist and jerked them\nhurriedly down the hall and out into the garden.\n\nAs they lay struggling on the ground outside, the Very Young Man felt\nhimself held less closely. He wrenched himself free and sprang to his\nfeet, standing close beside Aura's face. The man was up almost as\nquickly, preparing again to spring upon his victim. Something moved\nbehind the Very Young Man, and he looked up into the air hurriedly. The\nBig Business Man stood behind him; the Very Young Man met his anxious\nglance.\n\n\"I'm all right,\" he shouted. His antagonist leaped forward and at the\nsame instant a huge, flat object, that was the Big Business Man's foot,\nswept through the air and mashed the man down into the dirt of the\ngarden. The Very Young Man turned suddenly sick as he heard the agonized\nshriek and the crunching of the breaking bones. The Big Business Man\nlifted his foot, and the mangled figure lay still. The Very Young Man\nsat down suddenly in the garden path and covered his face with his\nhands.\n\nWhen he raised his head his friends were all standing round him,\ncrowding the garden. The body of the man who had attacked him had\ndisappeared. The Very Young Man looked up into Aura's face--she was on\nher feet now with the others and tried to smile.\n\n\"I'm all right,\" he repeated. \"I'll go get the food and things.\"\n\nIn a few minutes more he had made himself as large as his companions,\nand had brought with him most of the food. There still remained in the\nsmaller size the water-bottles, some of the food, the belts with which\nto carry it, and a few other articles they needed for the trip.\n\n\"I'll get them,\" said the Big Business Man; \"you sit down and rest.\"\n\nThe Very Young Man was glad to do as he was told, and sat beside Aura in\nthe garden, while the Big Business Man brought up to their size the\nremainder of the supplies.\n\nWhen they had divided the food, and all were equipped for the journey,\nthey started at once for the tunnels. Lylda's eyes again filled with\ntears as she left so summarily, and probably for the last time, this\nhome in which she had been so happy.\n\nAs they passed the last houses of the city, heading towards the tunnel\nentrances that the Chemist had selected, the Big Business Man and the\nChemist walked in front, the others following close behind them. A crowd\nof Oroids watched them leave, and many others were to be seen ahead; but\nthese scattered as the giants approached. Occasionally a few stood their\nground, and these the Big Business Man mercilessly trampled under foot.\n\n\"It's the only way; I'm sorry,\" he said, half apologetically. \"We cannot\ntake any chances now; we must get out.\"\n\n\"It's shorter through these tunnels I'm taking,\" the Chemist said after\na moment.\n\n\"My idea,\" said the Big Business man, \"is that we should go through the\ntunnels that are the largest. They're not all the same size, are they?\"\n\n\"No,\" the Chemist answered; \"some are a little larger.\"\n\n\"You see,\" the Big Business Man continued, \"I figure we are going to\nhave a fight. They're following us. Look at that crowd over there.\nThey'll never let us out if they can help it. When we get into the\ntunnels, naturally we'll have to be small enough to walk through them.\nThe larger we are the better; so let's take the very biggest.\"\n\n\"These are,\" the Chemist answered. \"We can make it at about so high.\" He\nheld his hand about the level of his waist.\n\n\"That won't be so bad,\" the Big Business Man commented.\n\nMeanwhile the Very Young Man, walking with Aura behind the leaders, was\ntalking to her earnestly. He was conscious of a curious sense of\ncompanionship with this quiet girl--a companionship unlike anything he\nhad ever felt for a girl before. And now that he was taking her with\nhim, back to his own world----\n\n\"Climb out on to the surface of the ring,\" he was saying, \"and then, in\na few minutes more, we'll be there. Aura, you cannot realize how\nwonderful it will be.\"\n\nThe girl smiled her quiet smile; her face was sad with the memory of\nwhat she was leaving, but full of youthful, eager anticipation of that\nwhich lay ahead.\n\n\"So much has happened, and so quickly, I cannot realize it yet, I know,\"\nshe answered. \"But that it will be very wonderful, up there above, I do\nbelieve. And I am glad that we are going, only----\"\n\nThe Very Young Man took her hand, holding it a moment. \"Don't, Aura. You\nmustn't think of that.\" He spoke gently, with a tender note in his\nvoice.\n\n\"Don't think of the past, Aura,\" he went on earnestly. \"Think only of\nthe future--the great cities, the opera, the poetry I am going to teach\nyou.\"\n\nThe girl laid her hand on his arm. \"You are so kind, my friend Jack. You\nwill have much to teach me, will you not? Is it sure you will want to? I\nshall be like a little child up there in your great world.\"\n\nAn answer sprang to the Very Young Man's lips--words the thinking of\nwhich made his heart leap into his throat. But before he could voice\nthem Loto ran up to him from behind, crying. \"I want to walk by you,\nJack; _mamita_ talks of things I know not.\"\n\nThe Very Young Man put his arm across the child's shoulders. \"Well,\nlittle boy,\" he said laughing, \"how do you like this adventure?\"\n\n\"Never have I been in the Great Forests,\" Loto answered, turning his\nbig, serious eyes up to his friend's face. \"I shall not be afraid--with\nmy father, and _mamita_, and with you.\"\n\n\"The Great Forests won't seem very big, Loto, after a little while,\" the\nVery Young Man said. \"And of course you won't be afraid of anything.\nYou're going to see many things, Loto--very many strange and wonderful\nthings for such a little boy.\"\n\nThey reached the entrance to the tunnel in a few moments more, and\nstopped before it. As they approached, a number of little figures darted\ninto its luminous blackness and disappeared. There were none others in\nsight now, except far away towards Arite, where perhaps a thousand stood\nwatching intently.\n\nThe tunnel entrance, against the side of a hill, stood nearly breast\nhigh.\n\n\"I'm wrong,\" said the Chemist, as the others came up. \"It's not so high\nall the way through. We shall have to make ourselves much smaller than\nthis.\"\n\n\"This is a good time to eat,\" suggested the Very Young Man. The others\nagreed, and without making themselves any smaller--the Big Business Man\nobjected to that procedure--they sat down before the mouth of the tunnel\nand ate a somewhat frugal meal.\n\n\"Have you any plans for the trip up?\" asked the Doctor of the Chemist\nwhile they were eating.\n\n\"I have,\" interjected the Big Business Man, and the Chemist answered:\n\n\"Yes, I am sure I can make it far easier than it was for me before. I'll\ntell you as we go up; the first thing is to get through the tunnels.\"\n\n\"I don't anticipate much difficulty in that,\" the Doctor said. \"Do you?\"\n\nThe Chemist shook his head. \"No, I don't.\"\n\n\"But we mustn't take any chances,\" put in the Big Business Man quickly.\n\"How small do you suppose we should make ourselves?\"\n\nThe Chemist looked at the tunnel opening. \"About half that,\" he replied.\n\n\"Not at the start,\" said the Big Business Man. \"Let's go in as large as\npossible; we can get smaller when we have to.\"\n\nIt took them but a few minutes to finish the meal. They were all tired\nfrom the exciting events of the day, but the Big Business Man would not\nhear of their resting a moment more than was absolutely necessary.\n\n\"It won't be much of a trip up to the forests,\" he argued. \"Once we get\nwell on our way and into one of the larger sizes, we can sleep safely.\nBut not now; it's too dangerous.\"\n\nThey were soon ready to start, and in a moment more all had made\nthemselves small enough to walk into the tunnel opening. They were, at\nthis time, perhaps six times the normal height of an adult Oroid. The\ncity of Arite, apparently much farther away now, was still visible up\nagainst the distant horizon. As they were about to start, Lylda, with\nAura close behind her, turned to face it.\n\n\"Good-by to our own world now we must say, my sister,\" she said sadly.\n\"The land that bore us--so beautiful a world, and once so kindly. We\nhave been very happy here. And I cannot think it is right for me to\nleave.\"\n\n\"Your way lies with your husband,\" Aura said gently. \"You yourself have\nsaid it, and it is true.\"\n\nLylda raised her arms up towards the far-away city with a gesture almost\nof benediction.\n\n\"Good future to you, land that I love.\" Her voice trembled. \"Good future\nto you, for ever and ever.\"\n\nThe Very Young Man, standing behind them with Loto, was calling:\n\"They're started; come on.\"\n\nWith one last sorrowful glance Lylda turned slowly, and, walking with\nher arm about her sister, followed the others into the depths of the\ntunnel.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI\n\nTHE FIGHT IN THE TUNNELS\n\n\nFor some time this strange party of refugees from an outraged world\nwalked in silence. Because of their size, the tunnel appeared to them\nnow not more than eight or nine feet in height, and in most places of\nnearly similar width. For perhaps ten minutes no one spoke except an\noccasional monosyllable. The Chemist and Big Business Man, walking\nabreast, were leading; Aura and Lylda with the Very Young man, and Loto\nclose in front of them, brought up the rear.\n\nThe tunnel they were traversing appeared quite deserted; only once, at\nthe intersection of another smaller passageway, a few little\nfigures--not more than a foot high--scurried past and hastily\ndisappeared. Once the party stopped for half an hour to rest.\n\n\"I don't think we'll have any trouble getting through,\" said the\nChemist. \"The tunnels are usually deserted at the time of sleep.\"\n\nThe Big Business Man appeared not so sanguine, but said nothing. Finally\nthey came to one of the large amphitheaters into which several of the\ntunnels opened. In size, it appeared to them now a hundred feet in\nlength and with a roof some twelve feet high. The Chemist stopped to let\nthe others come up.\n\n\"I think our best route is there,\" he pointed.\n\n\"It is not so high a tunnel; we shall have to get smaller. Beyond it\nthey are larger again. It is not far--half an hour, perhaps, walking as\nwe----\"\n\nA cry from Aura interrupted him.\n\n\"My brother, see, they come,\" she exclaimed.\n\nBefore them, out of several of the smaller passageways, a crowd of\nlittle figures was pouring. There were no shouts; there was seemingly no\nconfusion; just a steady, flowing stream of human forms, emptying from\nthe tunnels into the amphitheater and spreading out over its open\nsurface.\n\nThe fugitives stared a moment in horror. \"Good God! they've got us,\" the\nDoctor muttered, breaking the tenseness of the silence.\n\nThe little people kept their distance at first, and then as the open\nspace filled up, slowly they began coming closer, in little waves of\nmovement, irresistible as an incoming tide.\n\nAura turned towards the passageway through which they had entered. \"We\ncan go back,\" she said. And then. \"No--see, they come there, too.\" A\ncrowd of the little gray figures blocked that entrance also--a crowd\nthat hesitated an instant and then came forward, spreading out fan-shape\nas it came.\n\nThe Big Business Man doubled up his fists.\n\n\"It's fight,\" he said grimly. \"By God! we'll----\" but Lylda, with a low\ncry, flung herself before him.\n\n\"No, no,\" she said passionately. \"Not that; it cannot be that now, just\nat the last----\"\n\nAura laid a hand upon her sister's shoulder.\n\n\"Wait, my sister,\" she said gently. \"There is no matter of justice\nhere--for you, a woman--to decide. This is for men to deal with--a\nmatter for men--our men. And what they say to do--that must be done.\"\n\nShe turned to the Chemist and the Very Young Man, who were standing side\nby side.\n\n\"A woman--cannot kill,\" she said slowly. \"Unless--her man--says it so.\nOr if to save him----\"\n\nHer eyes flashed fire; she held her slim little body erect and rigid--an\nAmazon ready to fight to the death for those she loved.\n\nThe Chemist hesitated a moment. Before he could answer, a single shrill\ncry sounded from somewhere out in the silent, menacing throng. As though\nat a signal, a thousand little voices took it up, and with a great rush\nthe crowd swept forward.\n\nIn the first moment of surprise and indecision the group of fugitives\nstood motionless. As the wave of little, struggling human forms closed\nin around them, the Very Young Man came to himself with a start. He\nlooked down. They were black around him now, swaying back and forth\nabout his legs. Most of them were men, armed with the short,\nbroad-bladed swords, or with smaller knives. Some brandished other\nimprovised weapons; still others held rocks in their hands.\n\nA little pair of arms clutched the Very Young Man about his leg; he gave\na violent kick, scattering a number of the struggling figures and\nclearing a space into which he leaped.\n\n\"Back--Aura, Lylda,\" he shouted. \"Take Loto and Eena. Get back behind\nus.\"\n\nThe Big Business Man, kicking violently, and sometimes stooping down to\nsweep the ground with great swings of his arm, had cleared a space\nbefore them. Taking Loto, who looked on with frightened eyes, the three\nwomen stepped back against the side wall of the amphitheater.\n\nThe Very Young Man swiftly discarded his robe, standing in the knitted\nunder-suit in which he had swam the lake; the other men followed his\nexample. For ten minutes or more in ceaseless waves, the little\ncreatures threw themselves forward, and were beaten back. The confined\nspace echoed with their shouts, and with the cries of the wounded. The\nfive men fought silently. Once the Doctor stumbled and fell. Before his\nfriends could get to him, his body was covered with his foes. When he\ngot back upon his feet, knocking them off, he was bleeding profusely\nfrom an ugly-looking wound in his shoulder.\n\n\"Good God!\" he panted as the Chemist and the Big Business Man leaped\nover to him. \"They'll get us--if we go down.\"\n\n\"We can get larger,\" said the Big Business Man, pointing upwards to the\nroof overhead. \"Larger--and then----\" He swayed a trifle, breathing\nhard. His legs were covered with blood from a dozen wounds.\n\nOteo, fighting back and forth before them, was holding the crowd in\ncheck; a heap of dead lay in a semicircle in front of him.\n\n\"I'm going across,\" shouted the Very Young Man suddenly, and began\nstriding forward into the struggling mass.\n\nThe crowd, thus diverted, eased its attack for a moment. Slowly the Very\nYoung Man waded into it. He was perhaps fifty feet out from the side\nwall when a stone struck him upon the temple. He went down, out of sight\nin the seething mass.\n\n\"Come on,\" shouted the Big Business Man. But before he could move, Aura\ndashed past him, fighting her way out to where the Very Young Man lay.\nIn a moment she was beside him. Her fragile body seemed hopelessly\ninadequate for such a struggle, but the spirit within her made her fight\nlike a wild-cat.\n\nCatching one of the little figures by the legs she flung him about like\na club, knocking a score of the others back and clearing a space about\nthe Very Young Man. Then abruptly she dropped her victim and knelt down,\nplucking away the last of the attacking figures who was hacking at the\nVery Young Man's arm with his sword.\n\nThe Chemist and Big Business Man were beside her now, and together they\ncarried the Very Young Man back. He had recovered consciousness, and\nsmiled up at them feebly. They laid him on the ground against the wall,\nand Aura sat beside him.\n\n\"Gosh, I'm all right,\" he said, waving them away. \"Be with you in a\nminute; give 'em hell!\"\n\nThe Doctor knelt beside the Very Young Man for a moment, and, finding he\nwas not seriously hurt, left him and rejoined the Chemist and Big\nBusiness Man, who, with Oteo, had forced the struggling mass of little\nfigures some distance away.\n\n\"I'm going to get larger,\" shouted the Big Business Man a moment later.\n\"Wipe them all out, damn it; I can do it. We can't keep on this way.\"\n\nThe Doctor was by his side.\n\n\"You can't do it--isn't room,\" he shouted in answer, pausing as he waved\none of his assailants in the air above his head. \"You might take too\nmuch.\"\n\nThe Big Business Man was reaching with one hand under his robe. With his\nfeet he kicked violently to keep the space about him clear. A tiny stone\nflew by his head; another struck him on the chest, and all at once he\nrealized that he was bruised all over from where other stones had been\nhitting him. He looked across to the opposite wall of the amphitheater.\nThrough the tunnel entrance there he saw that the stream of little\npeople was flowing the other way now. They were trying to get out,\ninstead of pouring in.\n\nThe Big Business Man waved his arms. \"They're running away--look,\" he\nshouted. \"They're running--over there--come on.\" He dashed forward, and,\nfollowed by his companions, redoubled his efforts.\n\nThe crowd wavered; the shouting grew less; those further away began\nrunning back.\n\nThen suddenly a shrill cry arose--just a single little voice it was at\nfirst. After a moment others took it up, and still others, until it\nsounded from every side--three Oroid words repeated over and over.\n\nThe Chemist abruptly stopped fighting. \"It's done,\" he shouted. \"Thank\nGod it's over.\"\n\nThe cry continued. The little figures had ceased attacking now and were\nstruggling in a frenzy to get through the tunnels.\n\n\"No more,\" shouted the Chemist. \"They're going. See them going? Stop.\"\n\nHis companions stood by his side, panting and weak from loss of blood.\nThe Chemist tried to smile. His face was livid; he swayed unsteadily on\nhis feet. \"No more,\" he repeated. \"It's over. Thank God, it's over!\"\n\nMeanwhile the Very Young Man, lying on the floor with Aura sitting\nbeside him, revived a little. He tried to sit up after a few moments,\nbut the girl pulled him down.\n\n\"But I got to go--give 'em hell,\" he protested weakly. His head was\nstill confused; he only knew he should be back, fighting beside his\nfriends.\n\n\"Not yet,\" Aura said gently. \"There is no need--yet. When there is, you\nmay trust me, Jack; I shall say it.\"\n\nThe Very Young Man closed his eyes. The blurred, iridescent outlines of\nthe rocks confused him; his head was ringing. The girl put an arm under\nhis neck. He found one of her hands, and held it tightly. For a moment\nhe lay silent. Then his head seemed to clear a little; he opened his\neyes.\n\n\"What are they doing now, Aura?\" he asked.\n\n\"It is no different,\" the girl answered softly. \"So terrible a thing--so\nterrible----\" she finished almost to herself.\n\n\"I'll wait--just a minute more,\" he murmured and closed his eyes again.\n\nHe held the girl's hand tighter. He seemed to be floating away, and her\nhand steadied him. The sounds of the fighting sounded very distant\nnow--all blurred and confused and dreamlike. Only the girl's nearness\nseemed real--the touch of her little body against his as she sat beside\nhim.\n\n\"Aura,\" he whispered. \"Aura.\"\n\nShe put her face down to his. \"Yes, Jack,\" she answered gently.\n\n\"It's very bad--there--don't you think?\"\n\nShe did not answer.\n\n\"I was just thinking,\" he went on; he spoke slowly, almost in a whisper.\n\"Maybe--you know--we won't come through this.\" He paused; his thoughts\nsomehow seemed too big to put into words. But he knew he was very happy.\n\n\"I was just thinking, Aura, that if we shouldn't come through I just\nwanted you to know----\" Again he stopped. From far away he heard the\nshrill, rhythmic cry of many voices shouting in unison. He listened, and\nthen it all came back. The battle--his friends there fighting--they\nneeded him. He let go of the girl's hand and sat up, brushing back his\nmoist hair.\n\n\"Listen, Aura. Hear them shouting; I mustn't stay here.\" He tried,\nweakly, to get upon his feet, but the girl's arm about his waist held\nhim down.\n\n\"Wait,\" she said. Surprised by the tenseness of her tone, he relaxed.\n\nThe cry grew louder, rolling up from a thousand voices and echoing back\nand forth across the amphitheater. The Very Young Man wondered vaguely\nwhat it could mean. He looked into Aura's face. Her lips were smiling\nnow.\n\n\"What is it, Aura?\" he whispered.\n\nThe girl impulsively put her arms about him and held him close.\n\n\"But we are coming through, my friend Jack. We are coming through.\" The\nVery Young Man looked wonderingly into her eyes. \"Don't you hear? That\ncry--the cry of fear and despair. It means--life to us; and no more\ndeath--to them.\"\n\nThe Chemist's voice came out of the distance shouting: \"They're running\naway. It's over; thank God it's over!\"\n\nThen the Very Young Man knew, and life opened up before him again.\n\"Life,\" he whispered to himself. \"Life and love and happiness.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII\n\nA COMBAT OF TITANS\n\n\nIn a few minutes the amphitheater was entirely clear, save for the dead\nand maimed little figures lying scattered about; but it was nearly an\nhour more before the fugitives were ready to resume their journey.\n\nThe attack had come so suddenly, and had demanded such immediate and\ncontinuous action that none of the men, with the exception of the Very\nYoung Man, had had time to realize how desperate was the situation in\nwhich they had fallen. With the almost equally abrupt cessation of the\nstruggle there came the inevitable reaction; the men bleeding from a\nscore of wounds, weak from loss of blood, and sick from the memory of\nthe things they had been compelled to do, threw themselves upon the\nground utterly exhausted.\n\n\"We must get out of here,\" said the Doctor, after they had been lying\nquiet for a time, with the strident shrieks of hundreds of the dying\nlittle creatures sounding in their ears. \"That was pretty near the end.\"\n\n\"It isn't far,\" the Chemist answered, \"when we get started.\"\n\n\"We must get water,\" the Doctor went on. \"These cuts----\" They had used\nnearly all their drinking-water washing out their wounds, which Aura and\nLylda had bound up with strips of cloth torn from their garments.\n\nThe Chemist got upon his feet. \"There's no water nearer than the Forest\nRiver,\" he said. \"That tunnel over there comes out very near it.\"\n\n\"What makes you think we won't have another scrap getting out?\" the Very\nYoung Man wanted to know. He had entirely recovered from the effects of\nthe stone that had struck him on the temple, and was in better condition\nthan any of the other men.\n\n\"I'm sure,\" the Chemist said confidently, \"they were through; they will\nnot attack us again; for some time at least. The tunnels will be\ndeserted.\"\n\nThe Big Business Man stood up also.\n\n\"We'd better get going while we have the chance,\" he said. \"This getting\nsmaller--I don't like it.\"\n\nThey started soon after, and, true to the Chemist's prediction, met no\nfurther obstacle to their safe passage through the tunnels. When they\nhad reached the forest above, none of the little people were in sight.\n\nThe Big Business Man heaved a long sigh of relief. \"Thank goodness we're\nhere at last,\" he said. \"I didn't realize how good these woods would\nlook.\"\n\nIn a few minutes more they were at the edge of the river, bathing their\nwounds in its cooling water, and replenishing their drinking-bottles.\n\n\"How do we get across?\" the Very Young Man asked.\n\n\"We won't have to cross it,\" the Chemist answered with a smile. \"The\ntunnel took us under.\"\n\n\"Let's eat here,\" the Very Young Man suggested, \"and take a sleep; we're\nabout all in.\"\n\n\"We ought to get larger first,\" protested the Big Business Man. They\nwere at this time about four times Oroid size; the forest trees, so huge\nwhen last they had seen them, now seemed only rather large saplings.\n\n\"Some one of us must stay awake,\" the Doctor said. \"But there do not\nseem to be any Oroids up here.\"\n\n\"What do they come up here for, anyway?\" asked the Very Young Man.\n\n\"There's some hunting,\" the Chemist answered. \"But principally it's the\nmines beyond, in the deserts.\"\n\nThey agreed finally to stop beside the river and eat another meal, and\nthen, with one of them on guard, to sleep for a time before continuing\ntheir journey.\n\nThe meal, at the Doctor's insistence, was frugal to the extreme, and was\nsoon over. They selected Oteo to stand guard first. The youth, when he\nunderstood what was intended, pleaded so with his master that the\nChemist agreed. Utterly worn out, the travelers lay down on a mossy bank\nat the river's edge, and in a few moments were all fast asleep.\n\nOteo sat nearby with his back against a tree-trunk. Occasionally he got\nup and walked to and fro to fight off the drowsiness that came over him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHow long the Very Young Man slept he never knew. He slept dreamlessly\nfor a considerable time. When he struggled back to consciousness it was\nwith a curious feeling of detachment, as though his mind no longer was\nconnected with his body. He thought first of Aura, with a calm peaceful\nsense of happiness. For a long time he lay, drifting along with his\nthoughts and wondering whether he were asleep or awake. Then all at once\nhe knew he was not asleep. His eyes were open; before him stood the\nforest trees at the river's edge. And at the foot of one of the trees he\ncould see the figure of Oteo, sitting hunched up with his head upon his\nhands, fast asleep.\n\nRemembrance came to the Very Young Man, and he sat up with a start.\nBeside him his friends lay motionless. He looked around, still a little\nconfused. And then his heart leaped into his throat, for at the edge of\nthe woods he saw a small, lean, gray figure--the little figure of a man\nwho stood against a tree-trunk. The man's face was turned towards him;\nhe met the glistening eyes looking down and saw the lips parted in a\nleering smile.\n\nA thrill of fear ran over the Very Young Man as he recognized the face\nof Targo. And then his heart seemed to stop beating. For as he stared,\nfascinated, into the man's mocking eyes, he saw that slowly, steadily he\nwas growing larger. Mechanically the Very Young Man's hand went to his\narmpit, his fingers fumbling at the pouch strapped underneath. The vial\nof chemicals was not there!\n\nFor an instant more the Very Young Man continued staring. Then, with an\neffort, he turned his eyes away from the gaze that seemed to hypnotize\nhim. Beside him the Chemist lay sleeping. He looked back at Targo, and\nsaw him larger--almost as large now as he was himself.\n\nLike a cloak discarded, the Very Young Man's bewilderment dropped from\nhim. He recognized the danger, realized that in another moment this\nenemy would be irresistibly powerful--invincible. His mind was clear\nnow, his nerves steady, his muscles tense. He knew the only thing he\ncould do; he calculated the chances in a flash of thought.\n\nStill staring at the triumphant face of Targo, the Very Young Man jumped\nto his feet and swiftly bent over the sleeping form of the Chemist.\nReaching through the neck of his robe he took out the vial of chemicals,\nand before his friend was fairly awake had swallowed one of the pills.\n\nAs the Very Young Man sprang into action Targo turned and ran swiftly\naway, perhaps a hundred feet; then again he stopped and stood watching\nhis intended victim with his sardonic smile.\n\nThe Very Young Man met the Chemist's startled eyes.\n\n\"Targo!\" said the Very Young Man swiftly. \"He's here; he stole the drug\njust now, while I was sleeping.\"\n\nThe Chemist opened his mouth to reply, but the Very Young Man bounded\naway. He could feel the drug beginning to work; the ground under his\nfeet swayed unsteadily.\n\nSwiftly he ran straight towards the figure of Targo, where he stood\nleaning against a tree. His enemy did not move to run away, but stood\nquietly awaiting him. The Very Young Man saw he was now nearly the same\nsize that Targo was; if anything, the larger.\n\nA fallen tree separated them; the Very Young Man cleared it with a\nbound. Still Targo stood motionless, awaiting his onslaught. Then\nabruptly he stooped to the ground, and a rock whistled through the air,\nnarrowly missing the Very Young Man's head. Before Targo could recover\nfrom the throw the Very Young Man was upon him, and they went down\ntogether.\n\nBack and forth over the soft ground they rolled, first one on top, then\nthe other. The Very Young Man's hand found a stone on the ground beside\nthem. His fingers clutched it; he raised it above him. But a blow upon\nhis forearm knocked it away before he could strike; and a sudden twist\nof his antagonist's body rolled him over and pinned him upon his back.\n\nThe Very Young Man thought of his encounter with Targo before, and again\nwith sinking heart he realized he was the weaker of the two. He jerked\none of his wrists free and, striking upwards with all his force, landed\nfull on his enemy's jaw. The man's head snapped back, but he laughed--a\ngrim, sardonic laugh that ended in a half growl, like a wild beast\nenraged. The Very Young Man's blood ran cold. A sudden frenzy seized\nhim; he put all his strength into one desperate lunge and, wrenching\nhimself free, sprang to his feet.\n\nTargo was up almost as quickly as he, and for an instant the two stood\neyeing each other, breathing hard. At the Very Young Man's feet a little\nstream was flowing past. Vaguely he found himself thinking how peaceful\nit looked; how cool and soothing the water would be to his bruised and\naching body. Beside the stream his eye caught a number of tiny human\nfigures, standing close together, looking up at him--little forms that a\nsingle sweep of his foot would have scattered and killed. A shiver of\nfear ran across him as in a flash he realized this other danger. With a\ncry, he leaped sidewise, away from the water. Beside him stood a little\ntree whose bushy top hardly reached his waist. He clutched its trunk\nwith both hands and jerking it from the ground swung it at his enemy's\nhead, meeting him just as he sprang forward. The tree struck Targo a\nglancing blow upon the shoulder. With another laugh he grasped its roots\nand twisted it from the Very Young Man's hand. A second more and they\ncame together again, and the Very Young Man felt his antagonist's\npowerful arms around his body, bending him backwards.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Big Business Man stood beside the others at the river's edge,\nwatching the gigantic struggle, the outcome of which meant life or death\nto them all. The grappling figures were ten times his own height before\nhe fairly realized the situation. At first he thought he should take\nsome of the drug also, and grow larger with them. Then he knew that he\ncould not overtake their growth in time to aid his friend. The Chemist\nand the Doctor must evidently have reached the same conclusion, for\nthey, too, did nothing, only stood motionless, speechless, staring up at\nthe battling giants.\n\nLoto, with his head buried upon his mother's shoulder, and her arms\nholding him close, whimpered a little in terror. Only Aura, of all the\nparty, did not get upon her feet. She lay full length upon the ground, a\nhand under her chin, staring steadily upwards. Her face was\nexpressionless, her eyes unblinking. But her lips moved a little, as\nthough she were breathing a silent prayer, and the fingers of her hand\nagainst her face dug their nails into the flesh of her cheek.\n\nTaller far than the tree-tops, the two giants stood facing each other.\nThen the Very Young Man seized one of the trees, and with a mighty pull\ntore it up by the roots and swung it through the air. Aura drew a quick\nbreath as in another instant they grappled and came crashing to the\nground, falling head and shoulders in the river with a splash that\ndrenched her with its spray. The Very Young Man was underneath, and she\nseemed to meet the glance of his great eyes when he fell. The trees\ngrowing on the river-bank snapped like rushes beneath the huge bodies of\nthe giants, as, still growing larger, they struggled back and forth. The\nriver, stirred into turmoil by the sweep of their great arms, rolled its\nwaves up over the mossy banks, driving the watchers back into the edge\nof the woods, and even there covering them with its spray.\n\nA moment more and the giants were on their feet again, standing ankle\ndeep, far out in the river. Up against the unbroken blackness of the\nstarless sky their huge forms towered. For a second they stood\nmotionless; then they came together again and Aura could see the Very\nYoung Man sink on his knees, his hand trailing in the water. Then in an\ninstant more he struggled up to his feet; and as his hand left the water\nAura saw that it clutched an enormous dripping rock. She held her\nbreath, watching the tremendous figures as they swayed, locked in each\nother's arms. A single step sidewise and they were back nearly at the\nriver's bank; the water seethed white under their tread.\n\nThe Very Young Man's right arm hung limp behind him; the boulder in his\nhand dangled a hundred feet or more in the air above the water. Slowly\nthe greater strength of his antagonist bent him backwards. Aura's heart\nstood still as she saw Targo's fingers at the Very Young Man's throat.\nThen, in a great arc, the Very Young Man swept the hand holding the rock\nover his head, and brought it down full upon his enemy's skull. The\nboulder fell into the river with a thundering splash. For a brief\ninstant the giant figures hung swaying; then the titanic hulk of Targo's\nbody came crashing down. It fell full across the river, quivered\nconvulsively and lay still.\n\nAnd the river, backing up before it a moment, turned aside in its\ncourse, and flung the muddy torrent of its water roaring down through\nthe forest.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\n\nLOST IN SIZE\n\n\nThe Very Young Man stood ankle deep in the turgid little rivulet, a\ntightness clutching at his chest, and with his head whirling. At his\nfeet his antagonist lay motionless. He stepped out of the water, putting\nhis foot into a tiny grove of trees that bent and crackled like twigs\nunder his tread. He wondered if he would faint; he knew he must not.\nAway to the left he saw a line of tiny hills; beyond that a luminous\nobscurity into which his sight could not penetrate; behind him there was\nonly darkness. He seemed to be standing in the midst of a great barren\nwaste, with just a little toy river and forest at his feet--a child's\nplaything, set down in a man's great desert.\n\nThe Very Young Man suddenly thought of his friends. He stepped into the\nmiddle of the river and out again on the other side. Then he bent down\nwith his face close to the ground, just above the tops of the tiny\nlittle trees. He made the human figures out finally. Hardly larger than\nants they seemed, and he shuddered as he saw them. The end of his thumb\ncould have smashed them all, they were so small.\n\nOne of the figures seemed to be waving something, and the Very Young Man\nthought he heard the squeak of its voice. He straightened upright,\nstanding rigid, afraid to move his feet. He wondered what he should do,\nand in sudden fear felt for the vial of the diminishing drug. It was\nstill in place, in the pouch under his armpit. The Very Young Man\nbreathed a sigh of relief. He decided to take the drug and rejoin his\nfriends. Then as a sudden thought struck him he bent down to the ground\nagain, slowly, with infinite caution. The little figures were still\nthere; and now he thought they were not quite as tiny as before. He\nwatched them; slowly but unmistakably they were growing larger.\n\nThe Very Young Man carefully took a step backwards, and then sat down\nheavily. The forest trees crackled under him. He pulled up his knees,\nand rested his head upon them. The little rivulet diverted from its\ncourse by the body of Targo, swept past through the woods almost at his\nside. The noise it made mingled with the ringing in his head. His body\nached all over; he closed his eyes.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"He's all right now,\" the Doctor's voice said. \"He'll be all right in a\nmoment.\"\n\nThe Very Young Man opened his eyes. He was lying upon the ground, with\nAura sitting beside him, and his friends--all his own size\nagain--standing over him.\n\nHe met Aura's tender, serious eyes, and smiled. \"I'm all right,\" he\nsaid. \"What a foolish thing to faint.\"\n\nLylda stooped beside him, \"You saved us all,\" she said. \"There is\nnothing we can say--to mean what it should. But you will always know how\nwe feel; how splendid you were.\"\n\nTo the praise they gave him the Very Young Man had no answer save a\nsmile of embarrassment. Aura said nothing, only met his smile with one\nof her own, and with a tender glance that made his heart beat faster.\n\n\"I'm all right,\" he repeated after a moment of silence. \"Let's get\nstarted.\"\n\nThey sat down now beside the Very Young Man, and earnestly discussed the\nbest plan for getting out of the ring.\n\n\"You said you had calculated the best way,\" suggested the Doctor to the\nChemist.\n\n\"First of all,\" interrupted the Big Business Man. \"Are we sure none of\nthese Oroids is going to follow us? For Heaven's sake let's have done\nwith these terrible struggles.\"\n\nThe Very Young Man remembered. \"He stole one of the vials,\" he said,\npointing to Targo's body.\n\n\"He was probably alone,\" the Chemist reasoned. \"If any others had been\nwith him they would have taken some of the drug also. Probably Targo\ntook one of the pills and then dropped the vial to the ground.\"\n\n\"My idea,\" pursued the Big Business Man, \"is for us to get large just as\nquickly and continuously as possible. Probably you're right about Targo,\nbut don't let's take any chances.\n\n\"I've been thinking,\" he continued, seeing that they agreed with him.\n\"You know this is a curious problem we have facing us. I've been\nthinking about it a lot. It seemed a frightful long trip down here, but\nin spite of that, I can't get it out of my mind that we're only a very\nlittle distance under the surface of the ring.\"\n\n\"It's absolutely all in the viewpoint,\" the Chemist said with a smile.\n\"That's what I meant about having an easier method of getting out. The\ndistance depends absolutely on how you view it.\"\n\n\"How far would it be out if we didn't get any larger?\" the Very Young\nMan wanted to know.\n\n\"Based on the size of a normal Oroid adult, and using the terrestrial\nstandard of feet and inches as they would seem to us when Oroid size, I\nshould say the distance from Arite to the surface of the ring would be\nabout one hundred and fifty to a hundred and sixty thousand miles.\"\n\n\"Holy mackerel!\" exclaimed the Very Young Man.\n\n\"Don't let's do much walking while we're small.\"\n\n\"You have the idea exactly,\" smiled the Chemist.\n\n\"Taking the other viewpoint,\" said the Doctor. \"Just where do you figure\nthis Oroid universe is located in the ring?\"\n\n\"It is contained within one of the atoms of gold,\" the Chemist answered.\n\"And that golden atom, I estimate, is located probably within one\none-hundredth of an inch, possibly even one one-thousandth of an inch\naway from the circular indentation I made in the bottom of the scratch.\nIn actual distance I suppose Arite is possibly one-sixteenth of an inch\nbelow the surface of the ring.\"\n\n\"Certainly makes a difference how you look at it,\" murmured the Very\nYoung Man in awe.\n\nThe Chemist went on. \"It is obvious then, that although when coming down\nthe distance must be covered to some extent by physical movement--by\ntraveling geographically, so to speak--going back, that is not\naltogether the case. Most of the distance may be covered by bodily\ngrowth, rather than by a movement of the body from place to place.\"\n\n\"We might get lost,\" objected the Very Young Man. \"Suppose we got\nstarted in the wrong direction?\"\n\n\"Coming in, that is a grave danger,\" answered the Chemist, \"because then\ndistances are opening up and a single false step means many miles of\nerror later on. But going out, just the reverse is true; distances are\nshortening. A mile in the wrong direction is corrected in an instant\nlater on. Not coming to a realization of that when I made the trip\nbefore, led me to undertake many unnecessary hours of most arduous\nclimbing. There is only one condition imperative; the body growing must\nhave free space for its growth, or it will be crushed to death.\"\n\n\"Have you planned exactly how we are to get out?\" asked the Big Business\nMan.\n\n\"Yes, I have,\" the Chemist answered. \"In the size we are now, which you\nmust remember is several thousand times Oroid height, it will be only a\nshort distance to a point where as we grow we can move gradually to the\ncentre of the circular pit. That huge inclined plane slides down out of\nit, you remember. Once in the pit, with its walls closing in upon us, we\ncan at the proper moment get out of it about as I did before.\"\n\n\"Then we'll be in the valley of the scratch,\" exclaimed the Very Young\nMan eagerly. \"I'll certainly be glad to get back there again.\"\n\n\"Getting out of the valley we'll use the same methods,\" the Chemist\ncontinued. \"There we shall have to do some climbing, but not nearly so\nmuch as I did.\"\n\nThe Very Young Man was thrilled at the prospect of so speedy a return to\nhis own world. \"Let's get going,\" he suggested quickly. \"It sounds a\ncinch.\"\n\nThey started away in a few minutes more, leaving the body of Targo lying\nwhere it had fallen across the river. In half an hour of walking they\nlocated without difficulty the huge incline down which the Chemist had\nfallen when first he came into the ring. Following along the bottom of\nthe incline they reached his landing place--a mass of small rocks and\npebbles of a different metallic-looking stone than the ground around\nmarking it plainly. These were the rocks and boulders that had been\nbrought down with him in his fall.\n\n\"From here,\" said the Chemist, as they came to a halt, \"we can go up\ninto the valley by growth alone. It is several hours, but we need move\nvery little from this position.\"\n\n\"How about eating?\" suggested the Very Young Man.\n\nThey sat down at the base of the incline and ate another meal--rather a\nmore lavish one this time, for the rest they had taken, and the prospect\nof a shorter journey ahead of them than they had anticipated made the\nDoctor less strict. Then, the meal over, they took the amount of the\ndrug the Chemist specified. He measured it carefully--more than ten of\nthe pills.\n\n\"We have a long wait,\" the Chemist said, when the first sickness from\nthis tremendous dose had left them.\n\nThe time passed quickly. They spoke seldom, for the extraordinary\nrapidity with which the aspect of the landscape was changing, and the\nremarkable sensations they experienced, absorbed all their attention.\n\nIn about two hours after taking the drug the curving, luminous line that\nwas the upper edge of the incline came into view, faint and blurred, but\nstill distinct against the blackness of the sky. The incline now was\nnoticeably steeper; each moment they saw its top coming down towards\nthem out of the heights above, and its surface smoothing out and\nbecoming more nearly perpendicular.\n\nThey were all standing up now. The ground beneath them seemed in rapid\nmotion, coming towards them from all directions, and dwindling away\nbeneath their feet. The incline too--now in form a vertical concave\nwall--kept shoving itself forward, and they had to step backwards\ncontinually to avoid its thrust.\n\nWithin another hour a similar concave wall appeared behind them which\nthey could follow with their eyes entirely around the circumference of\nthe great pit in which they now found themselves. The sides of this pit\nsoon became completely perpendicular--smooth and shining.\n\nAnother hour and the action of the drug was beginning to slacken--the\nwalls encircling them, although steadily closing in, no longer seemed to\nmove with such rapidity. The pit as they saw it now was perhaps a\nthousand feet in diameter and twice as deep. Far overhead the blackness\nof the sky was beginning to be tinged with a faint gray-blue.\n\nAt the Chemist's suggestion they walked over near the center of the\ncircular enclosure. Slowly its walls closed in about them. An hour more\nand its diameter was scarcely fifty feet.\n\nThe Chemist called his companions around him.\n\n\"There is an obstacle here,\" he began, \"that we can easily overcome; but\nwe must all understand just what we are to do. In perhaps half an hour\nat the rate we are growing this enclosure will resemble a well twice as\ndeep, approximately, as it is broad. We cannot climb up its sides,\ntherefore we must wait until it is not more than six feet in depth in\norder to be able to get out. At that time its diameter will be scarcely\nthree feet. There are nine of us here; you can realize there would not\nbe room for us all.\n\n\"What we must do is very simple. Since there is not room for us all at\nonce, we must get large from now on only one at a time.\"\n\n\"Quite so,\" said the Big Business Man in a perfectly matter-of-fact\ntone.\n\n\"All of us but one will stop growing now; one will go on and get out of\nthe pit. He will immediately stop his growth so that he can wait for the\nothers and help them out. Each of us will follow the same method of\nprocedure.\"\n\nThe Chemist then went on to arrange the exact quantities of the drugs\nthey were each to take at specified times, so that at the end they would\nall be nearly the same size again. When he had explained all this to\nOteo and Eena in their native language, they were ready to proceed with\nthe plan.\n\n\"Who's first?\" asked the Very Young Man. \"Let me go with Loto.\"\n\nThey selected the Chemist to go first, and all but him took a little of\nthe other drug and checked their growth. The pit at this time was hardly\nmore than fifteen feet across and about thirty feet deep.\n\nThe Chemist stood in the centre of the enclosure, while his friends\ncrowded over against its walls to make room for his growing body. It was\nnearly half an hour before his head was above its top. He waited only a\nmoment more, then he sprang upwards, clambered out of the pit and\ndisappeared beyond the rim. In a few moments they saw his huge head and\nshoulders hanging out over the side wall; his hand and arm reached down\ntowards them and they heard his great voice roaring.\n\n\"Come on--somebody else.\"\n\nThe Very Young Man went next, with Loto. Nothing unusual marked their\ngrowth, and without difficulty, helped by the Chemist's hands reaching\ndown to them, they climbed out of the pit.\n\nIn an hour more the entire party was in the valley, standing beside the\nlittle circular opening out of which they had come.\n\nThe Very Young Man found himself beside Aura, a little apart from the\nothers, who gathered to discuss their plan for growing out of the\nvalley.\n\n\"It isn't much of a trip, is it, Aura?\" the Very Young Man said. \"Do you\nrealize, we're nearly there?\"\n\nThe girl looked around her curiously. The valley of the scratch appeared\nto them now hardly more than a quarter of a mile in width. Aura stared\nupwards between its narrow walls to where, several thousand feet above,\na narrow strip of gray-blue sky was visible.\n\n\"That sky--is that the sky of your world?\" she exclaimed. \"How pretty it\nis!\"\n\nThe Very Young Man laughed.\n\n\"No, Aura, that's not our sky. It's only the space in the room above the\nring. When we get the size we are going to be finally, our heads will be\nright up in there. The real sky with its stars will be even then as far\nabove us as your sky at Arite was above you.\"\n\nAura breathed a long sigh. \"It's too wonderful--really to understand,\nisn't it?\" she said.\n\nThe Very Young Man pulled her down on the ground beside him.\n\n\"The most wonderful part, Aura, is going to be having you up there.\" He\nspoke gently; somehow whenever he thought of this fragile little\ngirl-woman up in his strange bustling world, he felt himself very big\nand strong. He wanted to be her protector, and her teacher of all the\nnew and curious things she must learn.\n\nThe girl did not reply at once; she simply met his earnest gaze with her\nfrank answering smile of understanding.\n\nThe Chemist was calling to them.\n\n\"Oh, you Jack. We're about ready to start.\"\n\nThe Very Young Man got to his feet, holding down his hands to help Aura\nup.\n\n\"You're going to make a fine woman, Aura, in this new world. You just\nwait and see if you don't,\" he said as they rejoined the others.\n\nThe Chemist explained his plans to them. \"This valley is several times\ndeeper than its breadth; you can see that. We cannot grow large enough\nto jump out as we did out of the pit; we would be crushed by the walls\nbefore we were sufficiently tall to leap out.\n\n\"But we're not going to do as I did, and climb all the way up. Instead\nwe will stay here at the bottom until we are as large as we can\nconveniently get between the valley walls. Then we will stop growing and\nclimb up the side; it will only be a short distance then.\"\n\nThe Very Young Man nodded his comprehension. \"Unless by that time the\nwalls are too smooth to climb up,\" he remarked.\n\n\"If we see them getting too smooth, we'll stop and begin climbing,\" the\nChemist agreed. \"We're all ready, aren't we?\" He began measuring out the\nestimated quantities of the drug, handing it to each of them.\n\n\"Say, I'm terrible sorry,\" began the Very Young Man, apologetically\ninterrupting this procedure. \"But you know if it wasn't for me, we'd all\nstarve to death.\"\n\nIt was several hours since they had eaten last, and all of them were\nhungry, although the excitement of their strange journey had kept them\nfrom realizing it. They ate--\"the last meal in the ring\" as the Big\nBusiness Man put it--and in half an hour more they were ready to start.\n\nWhen they had reached a size where it seemed desirable again to stop\ngrowing the valley resembled a narrow ca\u00f1on--hardly more than a deep\nrift in the ground. They were still standing on its floor; above them,\nthe parallel edges of the rift marked the surface of the ring. The side\nwalls of the ca\u00f1on were smooth, but there were still many places where\nthey could climb out without much difficulty.\n\nThey started up a narrow declivity along the ca\u00f1on face. The Chemist led\nthe way; the Very Young Man, with Aura just in front of him, was last.\nThey had been walking only a moment when the Chemist called back over\nhis shoulder.\n\n\"It's getting very narrow. We'd better stop here and take the drug.\"\n\nThe Chemist had reached a rocky shelf--a ledge some twenty feet square\nthat jutted out from the ca\u00f1on wall. They gathered upon it, and took\nenough of the diminishing drug to stop their growth. Then the Chemist\nagain started forward; but, very soon after, a cry of alarm from Aura\nstopped him.\n\nThe party turned in confusion and crowded back. Aura, pale and\ntrembling, was standing on the very brink of the ledge looking down. The\nVery Young Man had disappeared.\n\nThe Big Business Man ran to the brink. \"Did he fall? Where is he? I\ndon't see him.\"\n\nThey gathered in confusion about the girl. \"No,\" she said. \"He--just a\nmoment ago he was here.\"\n\n\"He couldn't have fallen,\" the Doctor exclaimed. \"It isn't far down\nthere--we'd see him.\"\n\nThe truth suddenly dawned on the Doctor. \"Don't move!\" he commanded\nsharply. \"Don't any of you move! Don't take a step!\"\n\nUncomprehending, they stood motionless. The Doctor's gaze was at the\nrocky floor under his feet.\n\n\"It's size,\" he added vehemently. \"Don't you understand? He's taken too\nmuch of the diminishing drug.\"\n\nAn exclamation from Oteo made them all move towards him, in spite of the\nDoctor's command. There, close by Oteo's feet, they saw the tiny figure\nof the Very Young Man, already no more than an inch in height, and\nrapidly growing smaller.\n\nThe Doctor bent down, and the little figure waved its arms in terror.\n\n\"Don't get smaller,\" called the Doctor. But even as he said it, he\nrealized it was a futile command.\n\nThe Very Young Man answered, in a voice so minute it seemed coming from\nan infinite distance.\n\n\"I can't stop! I haven't any of the other drug!\"\n\nThey all remembered then. Targo had stolen the Very Young Man's vial of\nthe enlarging drug. It had never been replaced. Instead the Very Young\nMan had been borrowing from the others as he went along.\n\nThe Big Business Man was seized with sudden panic.\n\n\"He'll get lost. We must get smaller with him.\" He turned sidewise, and\nstumbling over a rock almost crushed the Very Young Man with the step he\ntook to recover his balance.\n\nAura, with a cry, pushed several of the others back; Oteo and Eena,\nfrightened, started down the declivity.\n\n\"We must get smaller!\" the Big Business Man reiterated.\n\nThe panic was growing among them all. Above their excited cries the\nDoctor's voice rose.\n\n\"Stand still--all of you. If we move--even a few steps--we can never get\nsmall and hope to find him.\"\n\nThe Doctor--himself too confused to know whether he should take the\ndiminishing drug at once or not--was bending over the ground. And as he\nwatched, fascinated, the Very Young Man's figure dwindled beyond the\nvanishing point and was gone!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX\n\nA MODERN DINOSAUR\n\n\nThe Very Young Man never knew quite how it happened. The Doctor had told\nthem to check their growth: and he took the drug abstractedly, for his\nmind was on Aura and how she would feel, coming for the first time into\nthis great outer world.\n\nWhat quantity he took, the Very Young Man afterward could never decide.\nBut the next thing he knew, the figures of his companions had grown to\ngigantic size. The rocks about him were expanding enormously. Already he\nhad lost the contour of the ledge. The ca\u00f1on wall had drawn back almost\nout of sight in the haze of the distance. He turned around, bewildered.\nThere was no precipice behind him. Instead, a great, rocky plain,\ntumbling with a mass of boulders, and broken by seams and rifts, spread\nout to his gaze. And even in that instant, as he regarded it in\nconfusion, it opened up to greater distances.\n\nNear at hand--a hundred yards away, perhaps--a gigantic human figure\ntowered five hundred feet into the air. Around it, further away, others\nequally large, were blurred into the haze of distance.\n\nThe nearer figure stooped, and the Very Young Man, fearful that he might\nbe crushed by its movement, waved his arms in terror. He started to run,\nleaping over the jagged ground beneath his feet. A great roaring voice\nfrom above came down to him--the Doctor's voice.\n\n\"Don't get smaller!\"\n\nThe Very Young Man stopped running, more frightened than ever before\nwith the realization that came to him. He shouted upward:\n\n\"I can't stop! I haven't any of the other drug!\"\n\nAn enormous blurred object came swooping towards him, and went past with\na rush of wind--the foot of the Big Business Man, though the Very Young\nMan did not know it. Above him now the air was filled with roaring--the\nexcited voices of his friends.\n\nA few moments passed while the Very Young Man stood stock still, too\nfrightened to move. The roaring above gradually ceased. The towering\nfigures expanded--faded back into the distance--disappeared.\n\nThe Very Young Man was alone in the silence and desolation of a jagged,\nbroken landscape that was still expanding beneath him. For some time he\nstood there, bewildered. He came to himself suddenly with the thought\nthat although he was too small to be seen by his friends, yet they must\nbe there still within a few steps of him. They might take a step--might\ncrush him to death without seeing him, or knowing that they had done it!\nThere were rocky buttes and hills all about him now. Without stopping to\nreason what he was doing he began to run. He did not know or care\nwhere--anywhere away from those colossal figures who with a single step\nwould crush the very hills and rocks about him and bury him beneath an\navalanche of golden quartz.\n\nHe ran, in panic, for an hour perhaps, scrambling over little ravines,\nfalling into a crevice--climbing out and running again. At last, with\nhis feet torn and bleeding, he threw himself to the ground, utterly\nexhausted.\n\nAfter a time, with returning strength, the Very Young Man began to think\nmore calmly. He was lost--lost in size--the one thing that the Doctor,\nwhen they started down into the ring, had warned them against so\nearnestly. What a fool he had been to run! He was miles away from them\nnow. He could not make himself large; and were they to get\nsmaller--small enough to see him, they might wander in this barren\nwilderness for days and never chance to come upon him.\n\nThe Very Young Man cursed himself for a fool. Why hadn't he kept some of\nthe enlarging drug with him? And then abruptly, he realized something\nadditionally terrifying. The dose of the diminishing drug which he had\njust taken so thoughtlessly, was the last that remained in that vial. He\nwas utterly helpless. Thousands of miles of rocky country surrounded\nhim--a wilderness devoid of vegetation, of water, and of life.\n\nLying prone upon the ground, which at last had stopped expanding, the\nVery Young Man gave himself up to terrified reflection. So this was the\nend--all the dangers they had passed through--their conquests--and the\njourney out of the ring so near to a safe ending.... And then this!\n\nFor a time the Very Young Man abandoned hope. There was nothing to do,\nof course. They could never find him--probably, with women and a child\namong them they would not dare even to try. They would go safely back to\ntheir own world--but he--Jack Bruce--would remain in the ring. He\nlaughed with bitter cynicism at the thought. Even the habitable world of\nthe ring itself, was denied him. Like a lost soul, poised between two\nworlds, he was abandoned, waiting helpless, until hunger and thirst\nwould put an end to his sufferings.\n\nThen the Very Young Man thought of Aura; and with the thought came a new\ndetermination not to give up hope. He stood up and looked about him,\nsteeling himself against the flood of despair that again was almost\noverwhelming. He must return as nearly as possible to the point where he\nhad parted from his friends. It was the only chance he had remaining--to\nbe close enough so if one, or all of them, had become small, they would\nbe able to see him.\n\nThere was little to choose of direction in the desolate waste around,\nbut dimly the Very Young Man recalled having a low line of hills behind\nhim when he was running. He faced that way now. He had come perhaps six\nor seven miles; he would return now as nearly as possible over the same\nroute. He selected a gully that seemed to wind in that general\ndirection, and climbing down into it, started off along its floor.\n\nThe gully was some forty feet deep and seemed to average considerably\nwider. Its sides were smooth and precipitous in some places; in others\nthey were broken. The Very Young Man had been walking some thirty\nminutes when, as he came abruptly around a sharp bend, he saw before him\nthe most terrifying object he had ever beheld. He stood stock still,\nfascinated with horror. On the floor of the gully, directly in front of\nhim, lay a gigantic lizard--a reptile hideous, grotesque in its\nenormity. It was lying motionless, with its jaw, longer than his own\nbody, flat on the ground as though it were sunning itself. Its tail,\nmotionless also, wound out behind it. It was a reptile that by its\nsize--it seemed to the Very Young Man at least thirty feet long--might\nhave been a dinosaur reincarnated out of the dark, mysterious ages of\nthe earth's formation. And yet, even in that moment of horror, the Very\nYoung Man recognized it for what it was--the tiny lizard the Chemist had\nsent into the valley of the scratch to test his drug!\n\nAt sight of the Very Young Man the reptile raised its great head. Its\ntongue licked out hideously; its huge eyes stared unblinking. And then,\nslowly, hastelessly, it began coming forward, its great feet scratching\non the rocks, its tail sliding around a boulder behind it.\n\nThe Very Young Man waited no longer, but turning, ran back headlong the\nway he had come. Curiously enough, this new danger, though it terrified,\ndid not confuse him. It was a situation demanding physical action, and\nwith it he found his mind working clearly. He leaped over a rock, half\nstumbled, recovered himself and dashed onward.\n\nA glance over his shoulder showed him the reptile coming around the bend\nin the gully. It slid forward, crawling over the rocks without effort,\nstill hastelessly, as though leisurely to pick up this prey which it\nknew could not escape it.\n\nThe gully here chanced to have smooth, almost perpendicular sides. The\nVery Young Man saw that he could not climb out; and even if he could, he\nknew that the reptile would go up the sides as easily as along the\nfloor. It had been over a hundred feet from him when he first saw it.\nNow it was less than half that distance and gaining rapidly.\n\nFor an instant the Very Young Man slackened his flight. To run on would\nbe futile. The reptile would overtake him any moment; even now he knew\nthat with a sudden spring it could land upon him.\n\nA cross rift at right angles in the wall came into sight--a break in the\nrock as though it had been riven apart by some gigantic wedge. It was as\ndeep as the gully itself and just wide enough to admit the passage of\nthe Very Young Man's body. He darted into it; and heard behind him the\nspring of the reptile as it landed at the entrance to the rift into\nwhich its huge size barred it from advancing.\n\nThe Very Young Man stopped--panting for breath. He could just turn about\nbetween the enclosing walls. Behind him, outside in the gully, the\nlizard lay baffled. And then, seemingly without further interest, it\nmoved away.\n\nThe Very Young Man rested. The danger was past. He could get out of the\nrift, doubtless, further ahead, without reentering the gully. And, if he\nkept well away from the reptile, probably it would not bother him.\n\nExultation filled the Very Young Man. And then again he remembered his\nsituation--lost in size, helpless, without the power to rejoin his\nfriends. He had escaped death in one form only to confront it again in\nanother--worse perhaps, since it was the more lingering.\n\nAhead of him, the rift seemed ascending and opening up. He followed it,\nand in a few hundred yards was again on the broken plateau above, level\nnow with the top of the gully.\n\nThe winding gully itself, the Very Young Man could see plainly. Its\nnearest point to him was some six hundred feet away; and in its bottom\nhe knew that hideous reptile lurked. He shuddered and turned away,\ninstinctively walking quietly, fearing to make some noise that might\nagain attract its attention to him.\n\nAnd then came a sound that drove the blood from his face and turned him\ncold all over. From the depths of the gully, in another of its bends\nnearby, the sound of an anxious girl's voice floated upward.\n\n\"Jack! Oh Jack!\" And again:\n\n\"Jack--my friend Jack!\"\n\nIt was Aura, his own size perhaps, in the gully searching for him!\n\nWith frantic, horrified haste, the Very Young Man ran towards the top of\nthe gully. He shouted warningly, as he ran.\n\nAura must have heard him, for her voice changed from anxiety to a glad\ncry of relief. He reached the top of the gully; at its bottom--forty\nfeet below down its precipitous side--stood Aura, looking up, radiant,\nto greet him.\n\n\"I took the drug,\" she cried. \"I took it before they could forbid me.\nThey are waiting--up there for us. There is no danger now, Jack.\"\n\nThe Very Young Man tried to silence her. A noise down the gully made him\nturn. The gigantic reptile appeared round the nearby bend. It saw the\ngirl and scuttled forward, rattling the loose bowlders beneath its feet\nas it came.\n\nAura saw it the same instant. She looked up helplessly to the Very Young\nMan above her; then she turned and ran down the gully.\n\nThe Very Young Man stood transfixed. It was a sheer drop of forty feet\nor more to the gully floor beneath him. There was seemingly nothing that\nhe could do in those few terrible seconds, and yet with subconscious,\ninstinctive reasoning, he did the one and only thing possible. A loose\nmass of the jagged, gold quartz hung over the gully wall. Frantically he\ntore at it--pried loose with feet and hands a bowlder that hung poised.\nAs the lizard approached, the loosened rock slid forward, and dropped\nsquarely upon the reptile's broad back.\n\nIt was a bowlder nearly as large as the Very Young Man himself, but the\ngigantic reptile shook it off, writhing and twisting for an instant, and\nhurling the smaller loose rocks about the floor of the gully with its\nstruggles.\n\nThe Very Young Man cast about for another missile, but there were none\nat hand. Aura, at the confusion, had stopped about two hundred feet\naway.\n\n\"Run!\" shouted the Very Young Man. \"Hide somewhere! Run!\"\n\nThe lizard, momentarily stunned, recovered swiftly. Again it started\nforward, seemingly now as alert as before. And then, without warning, in\nthe air above his head the Very Young Man heard the rush of gigantic\nwings. A tremendous grey body swooped past him and into the gully--a\nbird larger in proportion than the lizard itself.... It was the little\nsparrow the Chemist had sent in from the outside world--maddened now by\nthirst and hunger, which to the reptile had been much more endurable.\n\nThe Very Young Man, shouting again to Aura to run, stood awestruck,\nwatching the titanic struggle that was raging below him. The great\nlizard rose high on its forelegs to meet this enemy. Its tremendous jaws\nopened--and snapped closed; but the bird avoided them. Its huge claws\ngripped the reptile's back; its flapping wings spread the sixty foot\nwidth of the gully as it strove to raise its prey into the air. The\nroaring of these enormous wings was deafening; the wind from them as\nthey came up tore past the Very Young Man in violent gusts; and as they\nwent down, the suction of air almost swept him over the brink of the\nprecipice. He flung himself prone, clinging desperately to hold his\nposition.\n\nThe lizard threshed and squirmed. A swish of its enormous tail struck\nthe gully wall and brought down an avalanche of loose, golden rock. But\nthe giant bird held its grip; its bill--so large that the Very Young\nMan's body could easily have lain within it--pecked ferociously at the\nlizard's head.\n\nIt was a struggle to the death--an unequal struggle, though it raged for\nmany minutes with an uncanny fury. At last, dragging its adversary to\nwhere the gully was wider, the bird flapped its wings with freedom of\nmovement and laboriously rose into the air.\n\nAnd a moment later the Very Young Man, looking upward, saw through the\nmagic diminishing glass of distance, a little sparrow of his own world,\nwith a tiny, helpless lizard struggling in its grasp.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Aura! Don't cry, Aura! Gosh, I don't want you to cry--everything's all\nright now.\"\n\nThe Very Young Man sat awkwardly beside the frightened girl, who,\novercome by the strain of what she had been through, was crying\nsilently. It was strange to see Aura crying; she had always been such a\nSpartan, so different from any other girl he had ever known. It confused\nhim.\n\n\"Don't cry, Aura,\" he repeated. He tried clumsily to soothe her. He\nwanted to thank her for what she had done in risking her life to find\nhim. He wanted to tell her a thousand tender things that sprang into his\nheart as he sat there beside her. But when she raised her tear-stained\nface and smiled at him bravely, all he said was:\n\n\"Gosh, that was some fight, wasn't it? It was great of you to come down\nafter me, Aura. Are they waiting for us up there?\" And then when she\nnodded:\n\n\"We'd better hurry, Aura. How can we ever find them? We must have come\nmiles from where they are.\"\n\nShe smiled at him quizzically through her tears.\n\n\"You forget, Jack, how small we are. They are waiting on the little\nledge for us--and all this country--\" She spread her arms toward the\nvast wilderness that surrounded them--\"this is all only a very small\npart of that same ledge on which they are standing.\"\n\nIt was true; and the Very Young Man realized it at once.\n\nAura had both drugs with her. They took the one to increase their size,\nand without mishap or moving from where they were, rejoined those on the\nlittle ledge who were so anxiously awaiting them.\n\nFor half an hour the Very Young Man recounted his adventure, with\npraises of Aura that made the girl run to her sister to hide her\nconfusion. Then once more the party started its short climb out of the\nvalley of the scratch. In ten minutes they were all safely on the\ntop--on the surface of the ring at last.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL\n\nTHE ADVENTURERS' RETURN\n\n\nThe Banker, lying huddled in his chair in the clubroom, awoke with a\nstart. The ring lay at his feet--a shining, golden band gleaming\nbrightly in the light as it lay upon the black silk handkerchief. The\nBanker shivered a little for the room was cold. Then he realized he had\nbeen asleep and looked at his watch. Three o'clock! They had been gone\nseven hours, and he had not taken the ring back to the Museum as they\nhad told him to. He rose hastily to his feet; then as another thought\nstruck him, he sat down again, staring at the ring.\n\nThe honk of an automobile horn in the street outside aroused him from\nhis reverie. He got to his feet and mechanically began straightening up\nthe room, packing up the several suit-cases. Then with obvious awe, and\na caution that was almost ludicrous, he fixed the ring in its frame\nwithin the valise prepared for it. He lighted the little light in the\nvalise, and, every moment or two, went back to look searchingly down at\nthe ring inside.\n\nWhen everything was packed the Banker left the room, returning in a\nmoment with two of the club attendants. They carried the suit-cases\noutside, the Banker himself gingerly holding the bag containing the\nring.\n\n\"A taxi,\" he ordered when they were at the door. Then he went to the\ndesk, explaining that his friends had left earlier in the evening and\nthat they had finished with the room.\n\nTo the taxi-driver he gave a number that was not the Museum address, but\nthat of his own bachelor apartment on Park Avenue. It was still raining\nas he got into the taxi; he held the valise tightly on his lap, looking\ninto it occasionally and gruffly ordering the chauffeur to drive slowly.\n\nIn the sumptuous living-room of his apartment he spread the handkerchief\non the floor under the center electrolier and laid the ring upon it.\nDismissing the astonished and only half-awake butler with a growl, he\nsat down in an easy-chair facing the ring, and in a few minutes more was\nagain fast asleep.\n\nIn the morning when the maid entered he was still sleeping. Two hours\nlater he rang for her, and gave tersely a variety of orders. These she\nand the butler obeyed with an air that plainly showed they thought their\nmaster had taken leave of his senses.\n\nThey brought him his breakfast and a bath-robe and slippers. And the\nbutler carried in a mattress and a pair of blankets, laying them with a\nsigh on the hardwood floor in a corner of the room.\n\nThen the Banker waved them away. He undressed, put on his bath-robe and\nslippers and sat down calmly to eat his breakfast. When he had finished\nhe lighted a cigar and sat again in his easy-chair, staring at the ring,\nengrossed with his thoughts. Three days he would give them. Three days,\nto be sure they had made the trip successfully. Then he would take the\nring to the Museum. And every Sunday he would visit it; until they came\nback--if they ever did.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Banker's living-room with its usually perfect appointments was in\nthorough disorder. His meals were still being served him there by his\ndismayed servants. The mattress still lay in the corner; on it the\nrumpled blankets showed where he had been sleeping. For the hundredth\ntime during his long vigil the Banker, still wearing his dressing-gown\nand slippers and needing a shave badly, put his face down close to the\nring. His heart leaped into his throat; his breath came fast; for along\nthe edge of the ring a tiny little line of figures was slowly moving.\n\nHe looked closer, careful lest his laboured breathing blow them away. He\nsaw they were human forms--little upright figures, an eighth of an inch\nor less in height--moving slowly along one behind the other. He counted\nnine of them. Nine! he thought, with a shock of surprise. Why, only\nthree had gone in! Then they had found Rogers, and were bringing him and\nothers back with him!\n\nRelief from the strain of many hours surged over the Banker. His eyes\nfilled with tears; he dashed them away--and thought how ridiculous a\nfeeling it was that possessed him. Then suddenly his head felt queer; he\nwas afraid he was going to faint. He rose unsteadily to his feet, and\nthrew himself full-length upon the mattress in the corner of the room.\nThen his senses faded. He seemed hardly to faint, but rather to drift\noff into an involuntary but pleasant slumber.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith returning consciousness the Banker heard in the room a confusion of\nmany voices. He opened his eyes; the Doctor was sitting on the mattress\nbeside him. The Banker smiled and parted his lips to speak, but the\nDoctor interrupted him.\n\n\"Well, old friend!\" he cried heartily. \"What happened to you? Here we\nare back all safely.\"\n\nThe Banker shook his friend's hand with emotion; then after a moment he\nsat up and looked about him. The room seemed full of people--strange\nlooking figures, in extraordinary costumes, dirty and torn. The Very\nYoung Man crowded forward.\n\n\"We got back, sir, didn't we?\" he said.\n\nThe Banker saw he was holding a young girl by the hand--the most\nremarkable-looking girl, the Banker thought, that he had ever beheld.\nHer single garment, hanging short of her bare knees, was ragged and\ndirty; her jet black hair fell in tangled masses over her shoulders.\n\n\"This is Aura,\" said the Very Young Man. His voice was full of pride;\nhis manner ingenuous as a child's.\n\nWithout a trace of embarrassment the girl smiled and with a pretty\nlittle bending of her head, held down her hand to the astonished Banker,\nwho sat speechless upon his mattress.\n\nLoto pushed forward. \"That's _mamita_ over there,\" he said, pointing.\n\"Her name is Lylda; she's Aura's sister.\"\n\nThe Banker recovered his wits. \"Well, and who are you, little man?\" he\nasked with a smile.\n\n\"My name is Loto,\" the little boy answered earnestly. \"That's my\nfather.\" And he pointed across the room to where the Chemist was coming\nforward to join them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI\n\nTHE FIRST CHRISTMAS\n\n\nChristmas Eve in a little village of Northern New York--a white\nChristmas, clear and cold. In the dark, blue-black of the sky the\nglittering stars were spread thick; the brilliant moon poured down its\nsilver light over the whiteness of the sloping roof-tops, and upon the\nghostly white, silently drooping trees. A heaviness hung in the frosty\nair--a stillness broken only by the tinkling of sleigh-bells or\nsometimes by the merry laughter of the passers-by.\n\nAt the outskirts of the village, a little back from the road, a\nfarmhouse lay snuggled up between two huge apple-trees--an\nold-fashioned, rambling farmhouse with a steeply pitched roof, piled\nhigh now, with snow. It was brilliantly lighted this Christmas Eve, its\nlower windows sending forth broad yellow beams of light over the\nwhiteness of the ground outside.\n\nIn one of the lower rooms of the house, before a huge, blazing log-fire,\na woman and four men sat talking. Across the room, at a table, a little\nboy was looking at a picture-book by the light of an oil-lamp.\n\nThe woman made a striking picture as she sat back at ease before the\nfire. She was dressed in a simple black evening-dress such as a lady of\nthe city would wear. It covered her shoulders, but left her throat bare.\nHer features, particularly her eyes, had a slight Oriental cast, which\nthe mass of very black hair coiled on her head accentuated. Yet she did\nnot look like an Oriental, nor indeed like a woman of any race of this\nearth. Her cheeks were red--the delicate diffused red of perfect health.\nBut underneath the red there lay a curious mixture of other colours, not\nonly on her cheeks but particularly noticeable on her neck and arms. Her\nskin was smooth as a pearl; in the mellow firelight it glowed, with the\niridescence of a shell.\n\nThe four men were dressed in the careless negligee of city men in the\ncountry. They were talking gaily now among themselves. The woman spoke\nseldom, staring dreamily into the fire.\n\nA clock in another room struck eight; the woman glanced over to where\nthe child sat, absorbed with the pictures in his book. The page at which\nhe was looking showed a sleigh loaded with toys, with a team of\nreindeers and a jolly, fat, white-bearded, red-jacketed old man driving\nthe sleigh over the chimney tops.\n\n\"Come Loto, little son,\" the woman said. \"You hear--it is the time of\nsleep for you.\"\n\nThe boy put down his book reluctantly and went over to the fireplace,\nstanding beside his mother with an arm about her neck.\n\n\"Oh, _mamita_ dear, will he surely come, this Santa Claus? He never knew\nabout me before; will he surely come?\"\n\nLylda kissed him tenderly. \"He will come, Loto, every Christmas Eve; to\nyou and to all the other children of this great world, will he always\ncome.\"\n\n\"But you must be asleep when he comes, Loto,\" one of the men admonished.\n\n\"Yes, my father, that I know,\" the boy answered gravely. \"I will go\nnow.\"\n\n\"Come back Loto, when you have undressed,\" the Chemist called after him,\nas he left the room. \"Remember you must hang your stocking.\"\n\nWhen they were left alone Lylda looked at her companions and smiled.\n\n\"His first Christmas,\" she said. \"How wonderful we are going to make it\nfor him.\"\n\n\"I can remember so well,\" the Big Business Man remarked thoughtfully,\n\"when they first told me there was no Santa Claus. I cried, for I knew\nChristmas would never be the same to me.\"\n\n\"Loto is nearly twelve years old,\" the Doctor said. \"Just\nimagine--having his first Christmas.\"\n\n\"We're going to make it a corker,\" said the Banker. \"Where's the tree?\nWe got one.\"\n\n\"In the wood-shed,\" Lylda answered. \"He has not seen it; I was so very\ncareful.\"\n\nThey were silent a moment. Then: \"My room is chock full of toys,\" the\nBanker said reflectively. \"But this is a rotten town for candy\ncanes--they only had little ones.\" And they all laughed.\n\n\"I have a present for you, Lylda,\" the Chemist said after a moment.\n\n\"Oh, but you must not give it until to-morrow; you yourself have told me\nthat.\"\n\nThe Chemist rose. \"I want to give it now,\" he said, and left the room.\nIn a moment he returned, carrying a mahogany pedestal under one arm and\na square parcel in the other. He set the pedestal upright on the floor\nin a corner of the room and began opening the package. It was a mahogany\ncase, cubical in shape. He lifted its cover, disclosing a glass-bell set\nupon a flat, mahogany slab. Fastened to the center of this was a\nhandsome black plush case, in which lay a gold wedding-ring.\n\nLylda drew in her breath sharply and held it; the three other men stared\nat the ring in amazement. The Chemist was saying: \"And I decided not to\ndestroy it, Lylda, for your sake. There is no air under this glass\ncover; the ring is lying in a vacuum, so that nothing can come out of it\nand live. It is quite safe for us to keep it--this way. I thought of\nthis plan, afterwards, and decided to keep the ring--for you.\" He set\nthe glass bell on the pedestal.\n\nLylda stood before it, bending down close over the glass.\n\n\"You give me back--my world,\" she breathed; then she straightened up,\nholding out her arms toward the ring. \"My birthplace--my people--they\nare safe.\" And then abruptly she sank to her knees and began softly\nsobbing.\n\nLoto called from upstairs and they heard him coming down. Lylda went\nback hastily to the fire; the Chemist pushed a large chair in front of\nthe pedestal, hiding it from sight.\n\nThe boy, in his night clothes, stood on the hearth beside his mother.\n\n\"There is the stocking, _mamita_. Where shall I hang it?\"\n\n\"First the prayer, Loto. Can you remember?\"\n\nThe child knelt on the hearth, with his head in his mother's lap.\n\n\"Now I lay me----\" he began softly, halting over the unfamiliar words.\nLylda's fingers stroked his brown curly head as it nestled against her\nknees; the firelight shone golden in his tousled curls.\n\nThe Chemist was watching them with moist eyes. \"His first Christmas,\" he\nmurmured, and smiled a little tender smile. \"His first Christmas.\"\n\nThe child was finishing.\n\n\"And God bless Aura, and Jack, and----\"\n\n\"And Grandfather Reoh,\" his mother prompted softly.\n\n\"And Grandfather Reoh--and _mamita_, and----\" The boy ended with a\nrush--\"and me too. Amen. Now where do I hang the stocking, mother?\"\n\nIn a moment the little stocking dangled from a mantel over the\nfireplace.\n\n\"You are sure he will come?\" the child asked anxiously again.\n\n\"It is certain, Loto--if you are asleep.\"\n\nLoto kissed his mother and shook hands solemnly with the men--a grave,\ndignified little figure.\n\n\"Good night, Loto,\" said the Big Business Man.\n\n\"Good night, sir. Good night, my father--good night, _mamita_; I shall\nbe asleep very soon.\" And with a last look at the stocking he ran out of\nthe room.\n\n\"What a Christmas he will have,\" said the Banker, a little huskily.\n\nA girl stood in the doorway that led into the dining-room adjoining--a\ncurious-looking girl in a gingham apron and cap. Lylda looked up.\n\n\"Oh, Eena, please will you say to Oteo we want the tree from the\nwood-shed--in the dining-room.\"\n\nThe little maid hesitated. Her mistress smiled and added a few words in\nforeign tongue. The girl disappeared.\n\n\"Every window gets a holly wreath,\" the Doctor said. \"They're in a box\noutside in the wood-shed.\"\n\n\"Look what I've got,\" said the Big Business Man, and produced from his\npocket a little folded object which he opened triumphantly into a long\nserpent of filigree red paper on a string with little red and green\npaper bells hanging from it. \"Across the doorway,\" he added, waving his\nhand.\n\nA moment after there came a stamping of feet on the porch outside, and\nthen the banging of an outer door. A young man and girl burst into the\nroom, kicking the snow from their feet and laughing. The youth carried\ntwo pairs of ice-skates slung over his shoulder; as he entered the room\nhe flung them clattering to the floor.\n\nThe girl, even at first glance, was extraordinarily pretty. She was\nsmall and very slender of build. She wore stout high-laced tan shoes, a\nheavy woollen skirt that fell to her shoe-tops and a short, belted coat,\nwith a high collar buttoned tight about her throat. She was covered now\nwith snow. Her face and the locks of hair that strayed from under her\nknitted cap were soaking wet.\n\n\"He threw me down,\" she appealed to the others.\n\n\"I didn't--she fell.\"\n\n\"You did; into the snow you threw me--off the road.\" She laughed. \"But I\nam learning to skate.\"\n\n\"She fell three times,\" said her companion accusingly.\n\n\"Twice only, it was,\" the girl corrected. She pulled off her cap, and a\ngreat mass of black hair came tumbling down about her shoulders.\n\nLylda, from her chair before the fire, smiled mischievously.\n\n\"Aura, my sister,\" she said in a tone of gentle reproof. \"So immodest it\nis to show all that hair.\"\n\nThe girl in confusion began gathering it up.\n\n\"Don't you let her tease you, Aura,\" said the Big Business Man. \"It's\nvery beautiful hair.\"\n\n\"Where's Loto?\" asked the Very Young Man, pulling off his hat and coat.\n\n\"In bed--see his stocking there.\"\n\nA childish treble voice was calling from upstairs. \"Good night,\nAura--good night, my friend Jack.\"\n\n\"Good night, old man--see you to-morrow,\" the Very Young Man called back\nin answer.\n\n\"You mustn't make so much noise,\" the Doctor said reprovingly. \"He'll\nnever get to sleep.\"\n\n\"No, you mustn't,\" the Big Business Man agreed. \"To-morrow's a very very\nbig day for him.\"\n\n\"Some Christmas,\" commented the Very Young Man looking around. \"Where's\nthe holly and stuff?\"\n\n\"Oh, we've got it all right, don't you worry,\" said the Banker.\n\n\"And mistletoe,\" said Lylda, twinkling. \"For you, Jack.\"\n\nEena again stood in the doorway and said something to her mistress. \"The\ntree is ready,\" said Lylda.\n\nThe Chemist rose to his feet. \"Come on, everybody; let's go trim it.\"\n\nThey crowded gaily into the dining-room, leaving the Very Young Man and\nAura sitting alone by the fire. For some time they sat silent, listening\nto the laughter of the others trimming the tree.\n\nThe Very Young Man looked at the girl beside him as she sat staring into\nthe fire. She had taken off her heavy coat, and her figure seemed long\nand very slim in the clothes she was wearing now. She sat bending\nforward, with her hands clasped over her knees. The long line of her\nslender arm and shoulder, and the delicacy of her profile turned towards\nhim, made the Very Young Man realize anew how fragile she was, and how\nbeautiful.\n\nHer mass of hair was coiled in a great black pile on her head, with a\nbig, loose knot low at the neck. The iridescence of her skin gleamed\nunder the flaming red of her cheeks. Her lips, too, were red, with the\nsmooth, rich red of coral. The Very Young Man thought with a shock of\nsurprise that he had never noticed before that they were red; in the\nring there had been no such color.\n\nIn the room adjoining, his friends were proposing a toast over the\nChristmas punch bowl. The Chemist's voice floated in through the\ndoorway.\n\n\"To the Oroids--happiness to them.\" Then for an instant there was\nsilence as they drank the toast.\n\nAura met the Very Young Man's eyes and smiled a little wanly.\n\"Happiness--to them! I wonder. We who are so happy to-night--I wonder,\nare they?\"\n\nThe Very Young Man leaned towards her. \"You are happy, Aura?\"\n\nThe girl nodded, still staring wistfully into the fire.\n\n\"I want you to be,\" the Very Young Man added simply, and fell silent.\n\nA blazing log in the fire twisted and rolled to one side; the crackling\nflames leaped higher, bathing the girl's drooping little figure in their\ngolden light.\n\nThe Very Young Man after a time found himself murmuring familiar lines\nof poetry. His memory leaped back. A boat sailing over a silent summer\nlake--underneath the stars--the warmth of a girl's soft little body\ntouching his--her hair, twisted about his fingers--the thrill in his\nheart; he felt it now as his lips formed the words:\n\n    \"The stars would be your pearls upon a string,\n    The world a ruby for your finger-ring,\n    And you could have the sun and moon to wear,\n    If I were king.\"\n\n\"You remember, Aura, that night in the boat?\"\n\nAgain the girl nodded. \"I shall learn to read it--some day,\" she said\neagerly. \"And all the others that you told me. I want to. They sing--so\nbeautifully.\"\n\nA sleigh passed along the road outside; the jingle of its bells drifted\nin to them. The Very Young Man reached over and gently touched the\ngirl's hand; her fingers closed over his with an answering pressure. His\nheart was beating fast.\n\n\"Aura,\" he said earnestly. \"I want to be King--for you--this first\nChristmas and always. I want to give you--all there is in this life, of\nhappiness, that I can give--just for you.\"\n\nThe girl met his gaze with eyes that were melting with tenderness.\n\n\"I love you, Aura,\" he said softly.\n\n\"I love you, too, Jack,\" she whispered, and held her lips up to his.\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE GIRL IN THE GOLDEN ATOM***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 21094-8.txt or 21094-8.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/1/0/9/21094\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
