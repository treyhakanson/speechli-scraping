I've\nreleased this story, along with five others, under the terms of a Creative\nCommons license that gives you, the reader, a bunch of rights that copyright\nnormally reserves for me, the creator.\n\nI recently did the same thing with the entire text of my novel, \"Down and Out in\nthe Magic Kingdom\" (http://craphound.com/down), and it was an unmitigated\nsuccess. Hundreds of thousands of people downloaded the book -- good news -- and\nthousands of people bought the book -- also good news. It turns out that, as\nnear as anyone can tell, distributing free electronic versions of books is a\ngreat way to sell more of the paper editions, while simultaneously getting the\nbook into the hands of readers who would otherwise not be exposed to my work.\n\nI still don't know how it is artists will earn a living in the age of the\nInternet, but I remain convinced that the way to find out is to do basic\nscience: that is, to do stuff and observe the outcome. That's what I'm doing\nhere. The thing to remember is that the very *worst* thing you can do to me as\nan artist is to not read my work -- to let it languish in obscurity and\ndisappear from posterity. Most of the fiction I grew up on is out-of-print, and\nthis is doubly true for the short stories. Losing a couple bucks to people who\nwould have bought the book save for the availability of the free electronic text\nis no big deal, at least when compared to the horror that is being irrelevant\nand unread. And luckily for me, it appears that giving away the text for free\ngets me more paying customers than it loses me.\n\nYou can find the canonical version of this file at\nhttp://craphound.com/place/download.php\n\nIf you'd like to convert this file to some other format and distribute it, you\nhave my permission, provided that:\n\n* You don't charge money for the distribution\n\n* You keep the entire text intact, including this notice, the license below, and\nthe metadata at the end of the file\n\n* You don't use a file-format that has \"DRM\" or \"copy-protection\" or any other\nform of use-restriction turned on\n\nIf you'd like, you can advertise the existence of your edition by posting a link\nto it at http://craphound.com/place/000013.php\n\n--\n\nHere's a summary of the license:\n\n\thttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd-nc/1.0\n\t\n\tAttribution.

He was the Ambassador to 1975, but back home in 1898, in New Jerusalem,\nUtah, they all thought he was Ambassador to France. When he disappeared, Mama\nand I came back through the triple-bolted door that led from our apt in 1975 to\nour horsebarn in 1898. We returned to the dusty streets of New Jerusalem, and I\nhad to keep on reminding myself that I was supposed to have been in France, and\n\"polly-voo\" for my chums, and tell whoppers about the Eiffel Tower and the fancy\nbread and the snails and frogs we'd eaten.\n\nI was born in New Jerusalem, and raised there till I was ten. Then, one summer's\nday, my Pa sat me on his knee and told me we'd be going away for a while, that\nhe had a new job.\n\n\"But what about the store?\" I said, scandalised. My Pa's wonderful store, the\nonly General Store in town not run by the Saints, was my second home. I'd spent\nmy whole life crawling and then walking on the dusty wooden floors, checking\nstock and unpacking crates with waybills from exotic places like Salt Lake City\nand even San Francisco.\n\nPa looked uncomfortable. \"Mr Johnstone is buying it.\"\n\nMy mouth dropped. James H Johnstone was as dandified a city-slicker as you'd\never hope to meet. He'd blown into town on the weekly Zephyr Speedball, and skinny\nTommy Benson had hauled his three huge steamer trunks to the cowboy hotel. He'd\ntipped Tommy two dollars, in Wells-Fargo notes, and later, in the empty lot\nbehind the smithy, all the kids in New Jerusalem had gathered 'round Tommy to\ngoggle at the small fortune in queer, never-seen bills.\n\n\"Pa, no!\" I said, without thinking. I knew that if my chums ordered their\nfathers around like that, they'd get a whipping, but my Pa almost never whipped\nme.\n\nHe smiled, and stretched his thick moustache across his face. \"James, I know you\nlove the store, but it's already been decided. Once you've been to France,\nyou'll see that it has wonders that beat anything that store can deliver.\"\n\n\"Nothing's better than the store,\" I said.\n\nHe laughed and rumpled my hair. \"Don't be so sure, son. There are more things in\nheaven and earth then are dreamed of in your philosophy.\" It was one of his\nsayings, from Shakespeare, who he'd studied back east, before I was born. It\nmeant that the discussion was closed.\n\nI decided to withhold judgement until I saw France, but still couldn't shake the\nfeeling that my Pa was going soft in the head. Mr Johnstone wasn't fit to run an\napple-cart. He was short and skinny and soft, not like my Pa, who, as far as I\nwas concerned, was the biggest, strongest man in the whole world. I loved my Pa.\n\n#\n\nWell, when we packed our bags and Pa went into the horsebarn to hitch up our\nteam, I figured we'd be taking a short trip out to the train station. All my\nchums were waiting there to see us off, and I'd promised my best pal Oly\nSweynsdatter that I'd give him my coonskin cap to wear until we came back. But\ninstead, Pa rode us to the edge of town, where the road went to rutted trail and\nsalt flats, and there was Mr James H Johnstone, in his own fancy-pants trap. Pa\nand me moved our luggage into Johnstone's trap and got inside with Mama and\nhunkered down so, you couldn't see us from outside. Mama said, \"You just hush up\nnow, James. There's parts of this trip that we couldn't tell you about before we\nleft, but you're going to have to stay quiet and hold onto your questions until\nwe get to where we're going.\"\n\nI nearly said, \"To where we're going?\" but I didn't, because Mama had never\nlooked so serious in all my born days. So I spent an hour hunkered down in\nthere, listening to the clatter of the wheels and trying to guess where we were\ngoing. When I heard the trap stop and a set of wooden doors close, all my\nguesses dried up and blew away, because I couldn't think of anywhere we would've\nheard those sounds out in the desert.\n\nSo imagine my surprise when I stood up and found us right in our very own\nhorsebarn, having made a circle around town and back to where we'd started from!\nMama held a finger up to her lips and then took Mr Johnstone's soft, girlish\nhand as he helped her down from the trap.\n\nMy Pa and Mr Johnstone started shifting one of the piles of hay-bales that\nstacked to the rafters, until they had revealed a triple-bolted door that looked\nnew and sturdy, fresh-sawn edges still bright and yellow, and not the weathered\nbrown of the rest of the barn.\n\nPa took a key ring out of his vest pocket and unlocked the door, then swung it\nopen. Each of us shouldered our bags and walked through, in eerie silence, into\na pitch black room.\n\nPa reached out and pulled the door shut, then there was a sharp click and we\nwere in 1975.\n\n#\n\n1975 was a queer sight. Our apartment was a lozenge of silver, spoked into the\nhub of a floating null-gee doughnut. Pa did something fancy with his hands and\nthe walls went transparent, and I swear, I dropped to the floor and hugged the\nnubby rubber tiles for all I was worth. My eyes were telling me that we were\nhundreds of yards off the ground, and while I'd jumped from the rafters of the\nhorsebarn into the hay countless times, I suddenly discovered that I was afraid\nof heights.\n\nAfter that first dizzying glimpse of 1975, I kept my eyes squeezed shut and held\non for all I was worth. After a minute or two of this, my stomach told me that I\nwasn't falling, and I couldn't hear any rushing wind, any birdcalls, anything\nexcept Mama and Pa laughing, fit to bust. I opened one eye and snuck a peek. My\nfolks were laughing so hard they had to hold onto each other to stay up, and\nthey were leaning against thin air, Pa's back pressed up against nothing at all.\n\nCautiously, I got to my feet and walked over to the edge. I extended one finger\nand it bumped up against an invisible wall, cool and smooth as glass in winter.\n\n\"James,\" said my Pa, smiling so wide that his thick moustache stretched all the\nway across his face, \"welcome to 1975.\"\n\n#\n\nPa's ambassadorial mission meant that he often spent long weeks away from home,\nteleporting in only for Sunday dinner, the stink of aliens and distant worlds\nclinging to him even after he washed up. The last Sunday dinner I had with him,\nMama had made mashed potatoes and corn bread and sausage gravy and turkey,\nspending the whole day with the wood-fired cooker back in 1898 (actually, it was\n1901 by then, but I always thought of it as 1898). She'd moved the cooker into\nthe horsebarn after a week of wrestling with the gadgets we had in our 1975\nkitchen, and when Pa had warned her that the smoke was going to raise questions\nin New Jerusalem, she explained that she was going to run some flexible exhaust\nhose through the door into 75 and into our apt's air-scrubber. Pa had shook his\nhead and smiled at her, and every Sunday, she dragged the exhaust pipe through\nthe door.\n\nThat night, Pa sat down and said grace, and he was in his shirtsleeves with his\nsuspenders down, and it almost felt like home -- almost felt like a million\nSunday dinners eaten by gaslight, with a sweaty pitcher of lemonade in the\nmiddle of the table, and seasonal wildflowers, and a stinky cheroot for Pa\nafterwards as he tipped his chair back and rested one hand on his belly, as if\nhe couldn't believe how much Mama had managed to stuff him this time.\n\n\"How are your studies coming, James?\" he asked me, when the robutler had\nfinished clearing the plates and clattered away into its nook.\n\n\"Very well, sir. We're starting calculus now.\" Truth be told, I hated calculus,\nhated Isaac Newton and asymptotes and the whole smelly business. Even with the\nviral learning shots, it was like swimming in molasses for me.\n\n\"Calculus! Well, well, well --\" this was one of Pa's catch-all phrases, like\n\"How _about_ that?\" or \"What do you know?\" \"Well, well, well. I can't believe\nhow much they stuff into kids' heads here.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. There's an awful lot left to learn, yet.\" We did a subject every two\nweeks. So far, I'd done French, Molecular and Cellular Biology, Physics and\nAstrophysics, Esperanto, Cantonese and Mandarin, and an alien language whose\nname translated as \"Standard.\" I'd been exempted from History, of course, along\nwith the other kids there from the past -- the Chinese girl from the Ming\nDynasty, the Roman boy, and the Injun kid from South America.\n\nPa laughed around his cigar and crossed his legs. His shoes were so big, they\nlooked like canoes. \"There surely is, son. There surely is. And how are you\ndoing with your classmates? Any tussles your teacher will want to talk to me\nabout?\"\n\n\"No, sir! We're friendly as all get-out, even the girls.\" The kids in 75 didn't\neven notice what they were doing in school. They just sat down at their\nworkstations and waited to have their brains filled with whatever was going on,\nand left at three, and never complained about something being too hard or too\ndull.\n\n\"That's good to hear, son. You've always been a good boy. Tell you what: you\nbring home a good report this Christmas, and I'll take you to see Saturn's rings\non vacation.\"\n\nMama shot him a look then, but he pretended he didn't see it. He stubbed out his\ncigar, hitched up his suspenders, and put on his tailcoat and tophat and\nambassadorial sash and picked up his leather case.\n\n\"Good night, son. Good night, Ulla. I'll see you on Wednesday,\" he said, and\nstepped into the teleporter.\n\nThat was the last time I ever saw him.\n\n#\n\n\"He died from bad snails?\" Oly Sweynsdatter said to me, yet again.\n\nI balled up a fist and stuck it under his nose. \"For the last time, yes. Ask me\nagain, and I'll feed you this.\"\n\nI'd been back for a month, and in all that time, Oly had skittered around me\nlike a shy pony, always nearby but afraid to talk to me. Finally, I'd grabbed\nhim and shook him and told him not to be such a ninny, tell me what was on his\nmind. He wanted to know how my Pa had died, over in France. I told him the\nreason that Mama and Mr Johnstone and the man from the embassy had worked out\ntogether. Now, I regretted it. I couldn't get him to shut up.\n\n\"Sorry, all right, sorry!\" he said, taking a step backwards. We were in the\norchard behind the schoolyard, chucking rotten apples at the tree-trunks to\nwatch them splatter. \"Want to hear something?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" I said.\n\n\"Tommy Benson's sweet on Marta Helprin. It's disgusting. They hold hands -- _in\nchurch_! None of the fellows will talk to him.\"\n\nI didn't see what the big deal was. Back in 75, we had had a two-week session on\nsexual reproduction, like all the other subjects. Most of the kids there were\nalready in couples, sneaking off to low-gee bounceataria and renting private\ncubes with untraceable cash-tokens. I'd even tussled with one girl, Katebe\nM'Buto, another exchange student, from United Africa Trading Sphere. I'd picked\nher up at her apt, and her father had even shaken my hand -- they grow up fast\nin UATS. Of course, I'd never let on to my folks. Pa would've broken an axle.\n\"That's pretty disgusting, all right,\" I said, unconvincingly.\n\n\"You want to go down to the river? I told Amos and Luke that I'd meet them after\nlunch.\"\n\nI didn't much feel like it, but I didn't know what else to do. We walked down to\nthe swimming hole, where some boys were already naked, swimming and horsing\naround. I found myself looking away, conscious of their nudity in a way that I'd\nnever been before -- all the boys in town swam there, all summer long.\n\nI turned my back to the group and stripped down, then ran into the water as\nquick as I could.\n\nI paddled around a little, half-heartedly, and then I found myself being pulled\nunder! My sinuses filled with water and I yelled a stream of bubbles, and closed\nmy mouth on a swallow of water. Strong hands pulled at my ankles. I kicked out\nas hard as I could, and connected with someone's head. The hands loosened and I\nshot up like a cork, sputtering and coughing. I ran for the shore, and saw one\nof the Allen brothers surfacing, rubbing at his head and laughing. The four\nAllen boys lived on a ranch with their parents out by the salt flats, and we\nonly saw them when they came into town with their folks for supplies. I'd never\nliked them, but now, I saw red.\n\n\"You pig!\" I shouted at him. \"You stupid, rotten, pig! What the heck do you\nthink you were doing?\"\n\nThe Allens kept on laughing -- I used to know some of their names, but in the\ntime I'd been in 75, they'd grown as indistinguishable as twins: big, hard boys\nwith their heads shaved for lice. They pointed at me and laughed. I scooped up a\nflat stone from the shore and threw it at the head of the one who'd pulled me\nunder, as hard as I could.\n\nLucky for him -- and me! -- I was too angry to aim properly, and the stone hit\nhim in the shoulder, knocking him backwards. He shouted at me -- it was like a\nroar of a wild animal -- and the four brothers charged.\n\nOly appeared at my side. \"Run!\" he shouted.\n\nI was too angry. I balled my fists and stood my ground. The first one shot out\nof the water towards me, and punched me so hard in the guts, I saw stars. I fell\nto the ground, gasping. I looked up at a forest of strong, bare legs, and knew\nthey'd surrounded me.\n\n\"It's the Sheriff!\" Oly shouted. The legs disappeared. I struggled to my knees.\n\nOly collapsed to the ground beside me, laughing. \"Did you see the way they ran?\nThe Sheriff never comes down to the river!\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" I said, around gasps, and started to get dressed.\n\n\"Any time,\" he said. \"Now, let's do some swimming.\"\n\n\"No, I gotta go home and help Mama,\" I lied. I didn't feel like going skinny\ndipping anymore -- maybe never again.\n\nOly gave me a queer look. \"OK. See you.\"\n\n#\n\nI went straight home, pelting down the road as fast as I could, not even looking\nwhere I was going. I let the door slam behind me and took the stairs two at a\ntime up to the attic ladder, then bolted the trap-door shut behind me and sat in\nthe dark, with my knees in my chest.\n\nDown below, Mama let out a half-hearted, \"James? Is that you?\" like she always\ndid since I came back home. I ignored her, like always, and she stopped worrying\nabout it, like always.\n\nPa's last trip had been to the Dalai Lama's court in 1975. The man from the\nembassy said that he was going to talk with the monks about a \"white-paper that\nthe two embassies were jointly presenting on the effect of mimetic\nambassadorships on the reincarnated soul.\" It was all nonsense to me. He'd never\narrived. The teleporter said that it had put him down gentle as you like on the\nfloor of the Lama's floating castle over the Caspian Sea, but the monks never\nsaw him.\n\nAnd that was that.\n\nIt had been a month since our return. I'd ventured out into town and looked up\nmy chums, and found them so full of gossip that didn't mean anything to me; so\nabsorbed with games that seemed childish to me; so strange, that I'd retreated\nhome. I'd prowled around our house like a burglar at first, and when I came back\nto the attic, all the numbness that had enveloped me since the man from the\nState Department had teleported into our apt melted away and I started bawling.\n\nThe attic had always been Pa's domain. He'd come up here with whatever crackpot\ninvention he'd ordered this month out of a catalog or one of the expensive,\nforeign journals he subscribed to, and tinker and swear and hit his thumbnail\nand tear his pants on a stray dingus and smoke his cheroots and have a heck of a\ntime.\n\nThe muffled tread of his feet and the distant cursing while I sat in the parlour\ndownstairs had been the homiest sound I knew. Mama and I would lock eyes every\ntime a particularly forceful round of hollers shook down, and Mama would get a\nlittle smile and her eyes would crinkle, and I felt like we were sharing a\nsecret.\n\nNow, the attic was my private domain: there was the elixir shelf, full of patent\nmedicines, hair-tonics, and soothing syrups. There was the bookcase full of wild\ntheories and fantastic adventure stories. There were the crates full of\ndangerous, coal-fired machines -- an automatic clothes-washing-machine, a\ncherry-pitter, and other devices whose nature I couldn't even guess at. None of\nthem had ever worked, but I liked to run my hands over them, feel the smooth\nsteel of their parts, disassemble and reassemble them. Back in 75, I'd once\ntried to take the robutler apart, just to get a look at how it was all put\ntogether, but it was a lost cause -- I couldn't even figure out how to get the\ncover off.\n\nI walked through the cool dark, the only light coming from the grimy attic\nwindow, and fondled each piece. I picked up an oilcan and started oiling the\njoints and bearings and axles of each machine in turn. Pa would have wanted to\nknow that everything was in good working order.\n\n#\n\n\"I think you should be going to school, James,\" Mama said, at breakfast. I'd\nalready done my morning chores, bringing in the coal, chopping kindling, taking\ncare of the milch-cows and making my bed.\n\nI took another forkful of sausage, and a spoonful of mush, chewed, and looked at\nmy plate.\n\n\"It's time, it's time. You can't spend the rest of your life sulking around\nhere. Your father would have wanted us to get on with our lives.\"\n\nEven though I wasn't looking at her when she said this, I knew that her eyes\nwere bright with tears, the way they always got when she mentioned Pa. His chair\nsat, empty, at the head of the table. I had another bite of sausage.\n\n\"James Arthur Nicholson! Look at me when I speak to you!\"\n\nI looked up, reflexively, as I always did when she used my full name. My eyes\nslid over her face, then focused on a point over her left shoulder.\n\n\"Yes'm.\"\n\n\"You're going to school. Today. And I expect to get a good report from Mr\nAdelson.\"\n\n\"Yes'm.\"\n\n#\n\nWe have two schools in New Jerusalem: the elementary school that was built\ntwenty years before, when they put in the wooden sidewalks and the town hall;\nand the non-denominational Academy that was built just before I left for 1975.\n\nMiss Tannenbaum, a spinster lady with a moustache and a bristling German accent\nterrorised the little kids in the elementary school -- I'd been stuck in her\nclass for five long years. Mr Adelson, who was raised in San Francisco and who\nhad worked as a roustabout, a telegraph operator and a merchant seaman taught\nthe Academy, and his wild stories were all Oly could talk about.\n\nHe raised one eyebrow quizzically when I came through the door at 8:00 that\nmorning. He was tall, like my Pa, but Pa had been as big as an ox, and Mr\nAdelson was thin and wiry. He wore rumpled pants and a shirt with a wilted\ncelluloid collar. He had a skinny little beard that made him look like a\ngentleman pirate, and used some shiny pomade to grease his hair straight back\nfrom his high forehead. I caught him reading, thumbing the hand-written pages of\na leatherbound volume.\n\n\"Mr Adelson?\"\n\n\"Why, James Nicholson! What can I do for you, sonny?\" New Jerusalem only had but\n2,000 citizens, and only a hundred or so in town proper, so of course he knew\nwho I was, but it surprised me to hear him pronounce my name in his creaky,\nweatherbeaten voice.\n\n\"My mother says I have to go to the Academy.\"\n\n\"She does, hey? How do you feel about that?\"\n\nI snuck a look at his face to see if he was putting me on, but I couldn't tell\n-- he'd raised up his other eyebrow now, and was looking hard at me. There might\nhave been the beginning of a smile on his face, but it was hard to tell with the\nbeard. \"I guess it don't matter how I feel.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know about that. This is a school, not a prison, after all. How old\nare you?\"\n\n\"Fourteen. Sir.\"\n\n\"That would put you in with the seniors. Do you think you can handle their\ncourse of study? It's half-way through the semester now, and I don't know how\nmuch they taught you when you were over in,\" he swallowed, \"France.\"\n\nI didn't know what to say to that, so I just stared at my hard, uncomfortable\nshoes.\n\n\"How are your maths? Have you studied geometry? Basic algebra?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. They taught us all that.\" And lots more besides. I had the feeling of\nicebergs of knowledge floating in my brain, ready to crest the waves and crash\nagainst the walls of my skull.\n\n\"Very good. We will be studying maths today in the seniors' class. We'll see how\nyou do. Is that all right?\"\n\nAgain, I didn't know if he was really asking, so I just said, \"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Marvelous. We'll see you at the 8:30 bell, then. And James --\" he paused,\nwaited until I met his gaze. His eyebrows were at rest. \"I'm sorry about your\nfather. I'd met him several times. He was a good man.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" I said, unable to look away from his stare.\n\n#\n\nThe first half of the day passed with incredible sloth, as I copied down\nproblems to my slate and pretended to puzzle over them before writing down the\nanswer I'd known the minute I saw the question.\n\nAt lunch I found a seat at the base of the big willow out front of the school\nand unwrapped the waxed paper from the thick ham sandwich Mama had fixed me. I\nmunched it and conjugated Latin verbs in my head, trying to make the day pass.\nOly and the fellows were roughhousing in the yard, playing follow-the-leader\nwith Amos Gundersen out front, showing off by walking on his hands and then\nspringing upright. Amos' mother came from circus people in Russia, and all the\nkids in his family wanted to be acrobats when they grew up.\n\nI tried not to watch them.\n\nI was engrossed in a caterpillar that was crawling up my pants-leg when Mr\nAdelson cleared his throat behind me. I started, and the caterpillar tumbled to\nthe ground, and then Mr Adelson was squatting on his long haunches at my side.\n\n\"How are you liking your first day, James?\" he asked, in his raspy voice.\n\n\"It's fine, sir.\"\n\n\"And the work? You're able to keep up with the class?\"\n\n\"It's not a problem for me. We studied this when I was away.\"\n\n\"Are you bored? Do you need more of a challenge?\"\n\n\"It's fine, sir.\" _Unless you want to assign me some large-prime factoring\nproblems_.\n\n\"Right, then. Don't hesitate to call on me if things are moving too slowly or\ntoo quickly. I mean that.\"\n\nI snuck another look at him. He seemed sincere.\n\n\"Why aren't you playing with your chums?\"\n\n\"I don't feel like it.\"\n\n\"You just wanted to think?\"\n\n\"I guess so.\" Why wouldn't he just leave me alone?\n\n\"It's hard to come home, isn't it?\"\n\nI stared at my shoes. What did he know about it?\n\n\"I've been around the world, you know that? I sailed with a tramp steamer, the\n_Slippery Trick_. I saw the naked savages of Polynesia, and the voodoo witches\nthat the freed slaves of the Caribbean worship, and the coolies pulling\nrickshaws in Peking. It was so _hard_ to come home to Frisco, after five years\nat sea.\"\n\nTo my surprise, he sat down next to me, in the dirt and roots at the base of the\ntree. \"You know, aboard the _Trick_, they called me Runnyguts -- I threw up\nevery hour for my first month. I was more reliable than the Watch! But they\ndidn't mean anything by it. When you live with a crew for years, you become a\ndifferent person. We'd be out at sea, nothing but water as far as the eye could\nsee, and we'd be playing cards on-deck. We'd told each other every joke we knew\nalready, and every story about home, and we knew that deck of cards so well,\nwhich one had salt-water stains on the back and which one turned up at corner\nand which one had been torn, and we'd just scream at the sun, so bored! But then\nwe'd put in to port at some foreign city, and we'd come down the plank in our\nbest clothes, twenty men who knew each other better than brothers, hard and\nbrown from months at sea, and it felt like whatever happened in that strange\nport-of-call, we'd come out on top.\"\n\n\"And then I came back to the Frisco, and the Captain shook my hand and gave me a\nsack of gold and saw me off, and I'd never felt so alone, and I'd never seen a\nplace so foreign.\n\n\"I went back to my old haunts, the saloons where I'd gone for a beer after a\nday's work at the docks, and the dance-halls, and the theatres, and I saw my old\nchums. That was hard, James.\"\n\nHe stopped then. I found myself saying, \"How was it hard, Mr Adelson?\"\n\nHe looked surprised, like he'd forgotten that he was talking to me. \"Well,\nJames, it's like this: when you're away that long, you get to invent yourself\nall over again. Of course, everyone invents themselves as they grow up. Your\nchums there --\" he gestured at the boys, who were now trying, with varying\nsuccess, to turn somersaults, dirtying their school clothes \"-- they're\ninventing themselves right now, whether they know it or not. The smart one, the\nstrong one, the brave one, the sad one. It's going on while we watch!\n\n\"But when you go away, nobody knows you, and you can be whoever you want. You\ncan shed your old skin and grow a new one. When we put out to sea, I was just a\nyoungster, eighteen years old and fresh from my Pa's house. He was a cablecar\nengineer, and wanted me to follow in his shoes, get an apprenticeship and join\nhim there under the hills, oiling the giant pulleys. But no, not me! I wanted to\nput out to sea and see the world. I'd never been out of the city, can you\nbelieve that? The first port where I took shore leave was in Haiti, and when I\nstepped onto the dock, it was like my life was starting all over again. I got a\ntattoo, and I drank hard liquor, and gambled in the saloons, and did all the\nthings that a man did, as far as I was concerned.\" He had a faraway look now,\nstaring at the boys' game without seeing it. \"And when I got back on-board, sick\nand tired and broke, there was a new kid there, a negro from Port-Au-Prince\nwho'd signed on to be a cabin boy. His name was Jean-Paul, and he didn't speak a\nword of English and I didn't speak a word of French. But I took him under my\nwing, James, and acted like I'd been at sea all my life, and showed him the\nropes, and taught him to play cards, and bossed him around, and taught him\nEnglish, one word at a time.\n\n\"And that became the new me. Every time a new hand signed on, I would be his\nteacher, his mentor, his guide.\n\n\"And then I came home.\n\n\"As far as the folks back home were concerned, I was the kid they'd said\ngood-bye to five years before. My father thought I was still a kid, even though\nI'd fought pirates and weathered storms. My chums wanted me to be the kid I'd\nbeen, and do all the boring, kid things we'd done before I left -- riding the\ntrolleys, watching the vaudeville shows, fishing off the docks.\n\n\"Even though that stuff was still fun, it wasn't _me_, not anymore. I missed the\nold me, and felt him slipping away. So, you know what I did?\"\n\n\"You moved to New Jerusalem?\"\n\n\"I moved to New Jerusalem. Well, to Salt Lake City, first. I studied with the\nJesuits, to be a teacher, then I saw an ad for a teacher in the paper, and I\npacked my bag and caught the next train. And here I am, not the me that came\nhome from sea, and not the me who I was before I went to sea, but someone in\nbetween, a new me -- teaching, but on dry land, and not chasing dangerous\nadventures, but still reading my old log-book and smiling.\"\n\nWe sat for a moment, in companionable silence. Then, abruptly, he checked his\npocket watch and yelped. \"Damn! Lunch was over twenty minutes ago!\" He leapt to\nhis feet, as smoothly as a boy, and ran into the schoolhouse to ring the bell.\n\nI folded up the waxed-paper, and thought about this adult who talked to me like\nan adult, who didn't worry about swearing, or telling me about his adventures,\nand I made my way back to class.\n\nIt went better, the rest of that day.\n\n#\n\nIn 75, Pa had almost never been home, but his presence was always around us.\n\nI'd call the robutler out of its closet and have it affix its electrode\nfingertips to my temples and juice my endorphins after a hard day at school, and\nwhen I was done, the faint smell of Pa's hair-oil, picked up from the 'trodes\nand impossible to be rid of, would cling to me. Or I'd sit down on the oubliette\nand find one of Pa's journals from back home, well-thumbed and open to an\narticle on mental telepathy. We did ESP in school, and it was all about a race\nof alien traders who communicated in geometric thought pictures that took\nforever to translate. We'd never learned about Magnetism and Astral Projection\nand all the other things Pa's journals were full of.\n\nAnd while I never doubted the things in Pa's journals, I never brought them up\nin class, neither. There were lots of different kinds of truth.\n\n\"James?\"\n\n\"Yes, Mama?\" I said, on my way out to chop kindling.\n\n\"Did you finish your homework?\"\n\n\"Yes, Mama.\"\n\n\"Good boy.\"\n\nHomework had been some math, and some biology, and some geology. I'd done it\nbefore I left school.\n\n#\n\nThe report cards came out in the middle of December. Mr Adelson sealed them with\nwax in thick brown envelopes and handed them out at the end of the day. Sealing\nthem was a dirty trick -- it mean a boy would have to go home not knowing\nwhether to expect a whipping or an extra slice of pie, and the fellows were as\nnervous as long-tailed cats in a rocking-chair factory when class let out. For\nonce, there was no horseplay afterwards.\n\nI came home and tossed the envelope on the kitchen table without a moment's\nworry. I'd aced every test, I'd done every take-home assignment, I'd led the\nclass, in a bored, sleepy way, regurgitating the things they'd stuck in my brain\nin 1975.\n\nI went up to the attic and started reading one of Pa's adventure stories,\n_Tarzan of the Apes_, by the Frenchman, Jules Verne. Pa had all of Verne's\nbooks, each of them crisply autographed on the inside cover. He'd met Verne on\none of his diplomatic missions, and the two had been like two peas in a pod, to\nhear him tell of it -- they both subscribed to all the same crazy journals.\n\nI was reading my favorite part, where Tarzan meets the man in the balloon, when\nMama's voice called from downstairs. \"James Arthur Nicholson! Get your behind\ndown here _now_!\"\n\nI jumped like I was stung and rattled down the attic stairs so fast I nearly\nbroke my neck and then down into the parlour, where Mama was holding my report\ncard and looking fit to bust.\n\n\"Yes, Mama?\" I said. \"What is it?\"\n\nShe handed me the report card and folded her arms over her chest. \"Explain that,\nmister. Make it good.\"\n\nI read the card and my eyes nearly jumped out of my head. The rotten so-and-so\nhad given me F's all the way down, in every subject. Below, in his seaman's\nhand, he'd written, \"James' performance this semester has disappointed me\ngravely. I would like it very much if I could meet with you and he, Mrs\nNicholson, at your earliest convenience, to discuss his future at the Academy.\nSigned, Rbt. Adelson.\"\n\nMama grabbed my ear and twisted. I howled and dropped the card. Before I knew\nwhat was happening, she had me over her knee and was paddling my bottom with her\nopen hand, hard.\n\n\"I don't\" -- whack -- \"know _what_\" -- whack -- \"you think\" -- whack -- \"you're\ndoing, James.\" -- whack -- \"If your _father_\" -- whack, _whack_ -- \"were here,\"\n-- whack -- \"he'd switch you\" -- whack -- \"within an inch of your life.\" And she\ngave me a load more whacks.\n\nI was too stunned even to cry or howl. Pa had only beat me twice in all the time\nI'd known him. Mama had _never_ beat me. My bottom ached distantly, and I felt\ntears come to my eyes.\n\n\"Well, what do you have to say for yourself?\"\n\n\"Mama, it's a mistake --\" I began.\n\n\"You're durn right!\" she said.\n\n\"No, really! I did all my homework! I passed all the exams! I showed 'em to you!\nYou saw 'em!\" The unfairness of it made my heart hammer in time to the throbbing\nof my backside.\n\nMama's breath fumed angrily out of her nose. \"You go straight to your room and\n_stay there_. We're going to see Mr Adelson first thing tomorrow morning.\"\n\n\"What about my chores?\" I said.\n\n\"Oh, don't worry about that. You'll have _plenty_ of chores to do when I let you\nout.\"\n\nI went to my room and stripped down, and lay on my tummy and cracked my window\nso the icy winter air blew over my backside. I cried a vale of tears, and rained\ndown miserable, mean curses on everyone: Mama, Pa, and especially the lying,\nsnaky, backstabbing Runnyguts Adelson.\n\n#\n\nMama didn't get any less mad through the night, but when she came to my door at\ncock-crow, she seemed to be holding it in better. My throat and eyes were sore\nas sandpaper from crying, and Mama gave me exactly five minutes to wash up and\ndress before dragging me out to the horsebarn. She'd already hitched up our team\nand refused my hand when I tried to help her up.\n\nI'd been angry and righteous when I woke, but seeing Mama's towering, barely\ncontrolled fury changed my mood to dire terror. I stared out at the trees and\nfarms as we rode into town, feeling like a condemned man being taken to the\ngallows.\n\nMama pulled up out front of the Academy and marched me around back to the\nteacher's cottage. She rapped on the door and waited, blowing clouds of steam\nout of her nose into the frosty morning air.\n\nMr Adelson answered the door in shirtsleeves and suspenders, unshaved and\nbleary. His hair, normally neatly oiled and slicked, stuck out like frayed\nbroom-straw. The muscles on his thin arms stood out like snakes. He blinked at\nus, standing on his doorstep. \"Mrs Nicholson!\" he said.\n\n\"Mr Adelson,\" my mother said. \"We've come to discuss James' report card.\"\n\nMr Adelson smoothed his hair back and stepped aside. \"Please, come in. Can I\noffer you some coffee?\"\n\n\"No, thank you,\" Mama said, primly, standing in his foyer. He held out his hand\nfor her coat and kerchief and she handed them to him. I took off my coat and\nstruggled out of my boots. He took them both and put them away in a closet.\n\n\"I'm going to have some coffee. Are you sure I can't offer you a cup?\"\n\n\"No. Thank you, all the same.\"\n\n\"As you wish.\" He disappeared down the dark hallway, and Mama and I found our\nway into his tiny parlour. Books were stacked every which where, dusty and\nprecarious. Mama and I sat down in a pair of cushioned chairs, and Mr Adelson\ncame in, holding two mugs of coffee. He set one down next to Mama on the floor,\nthen smacked himself in the forehead. \"You said no, didn't you? Sorry, I'm not\nquite awake yet. Well, leave it there -- there's cream in it, maybe the cat will\nhave some.\"\n\nHe settled himself onto another chair and sipped at his coffee. \"Let's start\nover, shall we? Hello, Mrs Nicholson. Hello, James. I understand you're here to\ndiscuss James' report card.\"\n\nMama sat back a little in her chair and let hint of a sardonic smile show on her\nface. \"Yes, we are. Forgive my coming by unannounced.\"\n\n\"Oh, it's nothing.\"\n\nMr Adelson drank more coffee. Mama smoothed her skirts. I kicked my feet against\nthe rungs of my chair. Finally, it was too much for me. \"What's the big idea,\nanyway?\" I said, glaring daggers at him. \"I don't deserve no F!\"\n\n\"Any F,\" Mr Adelson corrected. \"Why don't you think so?\"\n\n\"Well, because I did all my homework. I gave the right answers in class. I\npassed all the tests. It ain't fair!\"\n\n\"Not fair,\" my Mama corrected, gently. She was staring distractedly at Mr\nAdelson.\n\n\"What you say is true enough, James. What grade do you suppose you should've\ngotten?\"\n\n\"Why, an A! An A-plus! Perfect!\" I said, glaring again at him, daring him to say\notherwise.\n\n\"Is that what an A-plus is for, James? Perfection?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" I said, opening my mouth without thinking.\n\nMama shifted her stare to me. She was looking even more thoughtful.\n\n\"Why do you suppose you go to school?\"\n\n\"'Cause Mama says I have to,\" I said, sullenly.\n\n\"James!\" Mama said.\n\n\"Oh, I suppose it's to learn things,\" I said.\n\nMr Adelson smiled and nodded, the way he did when one of the students got the\nright answer in class. \"Well?\"\n\n\"Well, what?\" I said.\n\n\"What did you learn this semester?\"\n\n\"Why, everything you taught! Geometry! Algebra! Latin! Geography! Biology!\nPhysics! Grammar!\"\n\n\"I see,\" he said. \"James, what's the formula for determining the constant in the\nsecond derivative of an equation?\"\n\nI knew that one: it was one of Newton's dirty calculus proofs. \"It's a trick\nquestion. There's no way to get the constant of second derivative.\"\n\n\"Exactly right,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, and folded my arms across my chest.\n\n\"Where did you learn that?\"\n\n\"In --\" I started to say 1975, but caught myself. \"In France.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said. The fingers of dawn crept across my comprehension. \"Oh.\"\n\nMama smiled at me.\n\n\"But it's not fair! So what if I already knew everything before I started? I\nstill did all the work.\"\n\n\"Why are you in school, James?\" Mr Nicholson asked me again.\n\n\"To learn.\"\n\n\"Well, then I think you'd better start learning something, don't you? You're the\nbrightest student in the class. You're certainly smarter than I am -- I'm just\nan old sailor struggling along with the rest of the class. But you, you've _got\nit_. You've been marking time in class all semester, and I daresay you haven't\nlearned a single thing since you started. That's why you got F's.\"\n\n\"Mr Adelson,\" Mama said. \"Am I to understand that James performed all his\nassignments satisfactorily?\"\n\nIt was Mr Adelson's turn to squirm. \"Yes, but madam, you have to understand --\"\n\nMama waved aside his objections. \"If James satisfactorily completed all the work\nassigned to him, then I think he should have a grade that reflects that, don't\nyou?\" She took a sip of her coffee.\n\n\"Yes, well --\"\n\n\"However, you do have a point. I didn't send my son to your school so that he\ncould mark time, as you put it. I sent him there to learn. To be _taught_. Have\nyou taught him anything, Mr Adelson?\"\n\nMr Adelson looked so all-fired sad, I forgave him the report card and spoke up.\n\"Yes, Mama.\"\n\nMama swiveled her head to me. \"Really?\"\n\n\"Yes. He taught me what I was at school for. Just now.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Mama said. \"This is very good coffee, Mr Adelson.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" he said, and sipped at his.\n\n\"James,\" Mr Adelson said. \"You've learned your first lesson. What do you propose\nyour second should be?\"\n\n\"I dunno,\" I said, and went back to kicking the rungs of the chair.\n\n\"What is it that you have been doing since you came back to town, son?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"Hanging around in the attic, mostly. Reading. Tinkering. Like my Pa.\"\n\n\"My husband's machines and journals are up there,\" Mama explained.\n\n\"And his books,\" I said.\n\n\"Books?\" Mr Adelson looked suddenly interested. \"What kind of books?\"\n\n\"Adventure stories. Stevenson. Wells. Some of it's in French. We have all of\nVerne.\"\n\n\"Well, perhaps that can be your next assignment. I would like to see an original\ncomposition of no less than twenty pages, discussing each work of Verne's,\ncharting his literary progress. Due January fifth, please.\"\n\n\"Twenty pages!\" I said. \"But it's the holidays!\"\n\n\"Very well. Whatever length the piece turns out is fine. But be sure you do\njustice to each work.\"\n\n#\n\nBy the time I got through with the assignment, it was thirty-eight pages long. I\nnever thought I could write that much but it kept on coming, new thoughts about\neach book, each scene, the different worlds Verne had built: the fantastic\nslopes of Barsoom, the sinister Island of Dr Moreau. . . Each one spawned a new\ninsight. I felt like the Verne's detective, Sherlock Holmes, assembling all of\nthe seemingly insignificant details into some kind of coherent picture, finding\nthe improbable links between the wildly different stories the Frenchman told.\n\nMama was thrilled to see me working, papers spread out all around me on the\nkitchen table -- I could've used Pa's study, but it felt like an invasion,\nsomehow -- writing until my wrists cramped. She let me get away without doing my\nchores, rising early to milk the cow, bringing in the eggs from the henhouse,\neven chopping the kindling. Just so long as I was writing, she was happy to let\nme go on shirking my responsibilities.\n\nEven on Christmas Eve, I was too distracted to really enjoy the smells of goose\nand ham and the stuffing Mama spent days preparing. I was still writing when she\ntold me to go change and set the table for three.\n\n\"We're having Mr Johnston to dinner,\" she said.\n\nI made a face. Mr Johnston was the only one in town that I could have talked to\nabout my time in 1975, but I never did. He had a way of bossing a fellow around\nwhile seeming to be nice to him. He still ran Pa's store, using ladders to reach\nthe high shelves that Pa had just plucked things off of. I had to see him when\nMama sent me on errands there, but I made sure that I left as quickly as I\ncould. Mama kept saying that I should ask him for a job, but I was pretty good\nat changing the subject whenever it came up.\n\nI put away my papers and changed into my Sunday clothes. I'd been hinting to\nMama lately that a boy just wasn't complete without a puppy, so I put an extra\nshine on my shoes and said a quick prayer that I wouldn't find socks and\npicture-books under the tree.\n\nMr Johnstone arrived with a double-armload of gifts. Well, he _did_ run my Pa's\nstore, after all, so he could get things wholesale. I took his parcels from him\nand set them under the tree. Then that dandified sissy actually _kissed_ my Mama\non the cheek, lifting a sprig of mistletoe up with one hand. When Pa and Mama\nstood together, she'd barely come up to his shoulder, while Mr Johnstone had to\nstand on tiptoe to get the mistletoe over their heads. \"Merry Christmas, Ulla,\"\nhe said.\n\nShe took his hands and said, \"Merry Christmas, James.\"\n\nI wanted to be sick.\n\n#\n\nMr Johnstone had a whiskey in our parlour before we ate, sitting in my Pa's\nchair, smoking a cigar from my Pa's humidor. Mama ordered me to keep him company\nwhile she set out the meal.\n\n\"Do they call you Jimmy?\" he asked me, staring down his long, pointy nose.\n\n\"No, sir. James.\"\n\n\"It's a fine name, isn't it? Served me well, man and boy.\" He made a face that\nwas supposed to be funny, like he'd bit into a lemon.\n\n\"I like it fine, sir.\"\n\n\"Are you having any problems adjusting, now that you're home? Finding it hard to\nrelate to the other fellows?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"You don't find it strange, after seeing 1975?\"\n\n\"No, sir. It's home.\"\n\n\"Ha!\" he said, as though I'd said something profound. \"I guess it is, at that.\nSay, why don't you come by the store some time? I just got some samples from a\nnew candy company in Oregon, and I need to get an unbiased opinion before I\norder.\" He gave me a pinched smile, like he thought he was Santa Claus.\n\n\"Mama doesn't like me eating sweets,\" I said, and stared at my reflection in my\nshoes.\n\nMama rescued me by coming into the parlour then, looking young and pretty in her\nbest dress. \"Dinner is served, gentlemen.\"\n\nWe followed her into the dining room, and Mr Johnstone took my Pa's seat at the\nhead of the table and carved the goose. Even though the bird was brown and\njuicy, I found I didn't have any appetite.\n\n\"I have word from Pondicherry,\" Mr Johnstone said, as he poured gravy over his\nsecond helping of mashed potatoes.\n\n\"Yes?\" Mama said.\n\n\"Who's he?\" I asked.\n\n\"Your father's successor,\" Mr Johnstone said. \"A British officer from New Delhi.\nA fat little man, and awfully full of himself.\"\n\nI repressed a snort. For my money Mr Johnstone was as full of himself as one man\ncould be. I couldn't imagine a blacker kettle.\n\n\"He says that Nussbaum, from 1952 New York, has rolled back relations with\nextraterrestrials by fifty years. He sold a Centurian half a million defective\numbrellas from his brother-in-law's factory. The New Yorkers are all defending\nhim. _Caveat emptor_.\"\n\n\"I never could keep track of who was friendly and who wasn't,\" Mama said. \"It\nwas all Greek to me. Politics.\"\n\nMr Johnstone opened his mouth to explain, but Mama held up one hand. \"No, no, I\ndon't _want_ to understand. Les used to lecture me about this from dawn to\ndusk.\" She smiled a little sad smile and stared off at the cabbage-roses on our\ndining-room walls. Mr Johnstone put one hand over hers.\n\n\"He was a good man, Ulla.\"\n\nMama stood and smoothed her skirts. \"I'll get dessert.\"\n\n#\n\nI didn't get a puppy. Mr Johnstone gave me an air-rifle that I was sure Mama\nwould have fits over, but she just smiled. She gave me a beautiful fountain-pen\nand a green blotter and a ream of creamy, thick paper.\n\nThe pen made the most beautiful, jet-black marks, and the paper drank it up like\na thirsty man in the desert. I recopied my essay the next day, sitting with Mama\nin the parlour while she darned socks. Mr Johnstone had given her a tin of\ncosmetics from Paris, that he'd ordered in special. I'd heard Mama say that only\ndancehall girls wore makeup, but she blushed when he gave it to her. I gave her\na carving I'd done, of the robutler we'd had in 75. I'd whittled it out of a\nblock of pine, and sanded it and oiled it until it was as smooth as silk.\n\nOly Sweynsdatter came by after supper and asked if I wanted to go out and play\nwith the fellows. To my surprise, I found I did. We had a grand afternoon\npelting each other with snow-balls, a game that turned into a full-scale war, as\nall the older boys back from high-school came out and joined in, and then,\nlater, all the men, even the Sheriff and Mr Adelson. I never laughed so much in\nall my life, even when I got one right in the ear.\n\nMr Adelson led a charge of adults against the fort that most of the Academy boys\nwere hiding behind, but I saw him planning it and started laying in ammunition\nlong before they made their go, and we sent them back with their tails between\ntheir legs. I hit him smack in the behind with one ball as he dove for cover.\n\nOly's mother gave us both good, Svenska hot cocoa afterwards, with fresh whipped\ncream, and Oly and I exchanged gifts. He gave me a tin soldier, a Confederate\nwho was caught in the act of falling over backwards, clutching his chest. I gave\nhim my best marble. We followed his mother around their house, recounting the\nadventures in the snow until she told me it was time for me to go home.\n\n#\n\nSchool started again, and I went in early the first day to turn in my paper. Mr\nAdelson took it without comment and scanned the first few paragraphs. \"Thank\nyou, James, I think this will do nicely. I'll have it graded for you in the\nafternoon.\"\n\nI met Oly out in the orchard, where he was chopping kindling for the school's\nstove, a job we all took turns at. \"I hear you might be getting a new Pa for\nChristmas,\" he said. He gave me a smile that meant something, but I couldn't\nguess what.\n\n\"What is that supposed to mean?\" I asked.\n\n\"My Mama says your Mama had old man Johnstone over for Christmas dinner. And the\nwidow Ott told my Mama that she'd connected one or two calls between your house\nand the store every day in the last month. My Mama says that Johnstone is\ncourting your Mama.\"\n\n\"Mrs Ott isn't supposed to talk about the calls she connects,\" I said, as my\nmind reeled. \"It's like a telegraph operator: it's a confidential trust.\" Mr\nAdelson had told me that, once when he was telling me stories about his life\nbefore he went to sea.\n\n\"So, is it true?\"\n\n\"No!\" I said, surprising myself with my vehemence. \"My Mama just didn't want him\nto be alone at Christmas.\"\n\nOly swung the axe a few more times. \"Well, sure. But what about all the\ntelephone calls?\"\n\n\"That's business. The store is still partly ours. Mama's just looking after our\ninterests.\"\n\n\"If you say so,\" he said.\n\nI shoved him hard. I drew a line in the snow with my toe. \"I _do_ say so. Step\nacross the line if you say otherwise!\"\n\nOly got to his feet and looked at me. \"I don't want to fight with you, James. I\nwas just tellin' you what my Mama said.\"\n\n\"Well, your Mama ought to mind her own business,\" I said, baiting him.\n\nThat did it. He stepped over and popped me one, right in the nose. Oly and I had\nbeen chums since we could walk, and we'd had a few fights in our days but this\ntime it was different. I was so _angry_ at him, at my Mama, at my Pa, at New\nJerusalem, and we just kept on swinging at each other until Mr Adelson came out\nto ring the bell and separated us. My nose was sore and I was limping, and I'd\ntorn Oly's jacket and bent his fingers back, so he cradled his hand in the crook\nof his arm.\n\n\"Boys!\" Mr Adelson said. \"What the hell do you think you're doing? You're\nsupposed to be friends.\"\n\nHis language shocked me, but I was still plenty angry. \"He's no friend of mine!\"\nI said.\n\n\"That's fine with me,\" Oly said and glared at me.\n\nThe other kids were milling around, and Mr Adelson gave us both a look that\ncould melt steel, then rang the bell.\n\n#\n\nI could hardly concentrate in class that day. My Mama getting married? A new Pa?\nIt couldn't be true. But in my mind, I kept seeing my Mama and that Johnstone\nkissing under the mistletoe, and him sitting in my Pa's chair, drinking his\nwhiskey.\n\nOly's desk was next to mine, and he kept shooting me dirty looks. Finally, I\nleaned over and whispered, \"Cut it out, you idiot.\"\n\nOly said, \"You're the idiot. I think you got your brains scrambled in France,\nJames.\"\n\n\"I'll scramble your brains!\"\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Mr Adelson. \"Do you have something you'd like to share with\nthe class?\"\n\n\"No sir,\" we said together, and exchanged glares.\n\n\"James, perhaps you'd like to come up to the front and finish the lesson?\"\n\n\"Sir?\" I said, looking at the blackboard. He'd been going through quadratics, an\nelaborate first-principles proof.\n\n\"I believe you know this already, don't you? Come up to the front and finish the\nlesson.\"\n\nSlowly, I got up from my desk, leaving my slate on my desk, and made my way up\nto the front. Some of the kids giggled. I picked up a piece of chalk from the\nchalk-well, and started to write on the board.\n\nMr Adelson walked back to my seat and sat down. I stopped and looked over my\nshoulder, and he gave me a little scooting gesture that meant go on. I did, and\nby the end of the hour, I found that I was enjoying myself. I stopped frequently\nfor questions, and erased the board over and over again, filling it with steady\ncolumns of numbers and equations. I stopped noticing Mr Adelson in my seat, and\nwhen he stood and thanked me and told us we could eat our lunches, it seemed\nlike no time at all had passed.\n\nMr Adelson looked up from my essay. \"James, I'd like to have a chat with you.\nStay behind, please.\"\n\n\"Sit,\" he said, offering me the chair at his desk. He sat on one of the\nfront-row desks, and stared at me for a long moment.\n\n\"What was that mess this morning all about, James?\" he asked.\n\n\"Oly and I had an argument,\" I said, sullenly.\n\n\"I could see that. What was it about, if you don't mind my asking?\"\n\n\"He said something about my Mama,\" I said.\n\n\"I see,\" he said. \"Well, having met your mother, I feel confident in saying that\nshe's more than capable of defending herself. Am I right?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" I said.\n\n\"Then we won't see a repeat?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" I said. I didn't plan on talking to Oly ever again.\n\n\"Then we'll say no more about it. Now, about this morning's lesson: you did very\nwell.\"\n\n\"It was a dirty trick,\" I said.\n\nHe grinned like a pirate. \"I suppose it was. I wouldn't have played it on you if\nI didn't have every confidence in your abilities, though.\" He leaned across and\npicked up my essay from his desk. \"It was this that convinced me, really. This\nis as good as anything I've seen in scholarly journals. I've half a mind to send\nit to the _Idler_.\"\n\n\"I'm just a kid!\"\n\n\"You're an extraordinary boy. I'm tempted to let you teach all the classes, and\ntake up whittling.\"\n\nHe said it so deadpan, I couldn't tell if he was kidding me. \"Oh, you can't do\nthat! I'm not nearly ready to take over.\"\n\nHe laughed. \"You're readier than you think, but I expect the town council would\nstop my salary unless I did _some_ of the work around here. Still, I think\nthat's the most active I've seen you since you came to my class, and I'm running\nout of ideas to keep you busy. Maybe I'll keep you teaching maths. I'll give you\nmy lesson plan to take home before school's out.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n#\n\nMr Adelson gave me a stack of papers tied up with twine after he dismissed the\nclass for the day. I went home and did my chores, then unwrapped the parcel in\nthe parlour. The lesson plans were there, laid out, day by day, and in the\ncentre of them was a smaller parcel, wrapped in coloured paper. \"Merry\nChristmas,\" was written across it, in his hand.\n\nI opened it, and found a slim book. \"War of the Worlds,\" by Verne. For some\nreason, it rang a bell. I thought that maybe it had been on our bookcase in 75,\nbut somehow, it hadn't made it back home with us. I opened it, and read the\ninscription he'd written: \"From one traveller to another, Merry Christmas.\"\n\nI forced myself to read the lesson plans for the next month before I allowed\nmyself to start the Verne, and once I started, I found I couldn't stop. Mama had\nto drag me away for dinner.\n\n#\n\nMy trip back to 1975 wasn't planned, but it wasn't an accident, either. We'd\ngotten a new load of hay in for our team, and Mama added stacking it in the\nhorsebarn to my chores. I'd been consciously avoiding the horsebarn since Pa had\ndisappeared. Every time I looked at it, I felt a little hexed, a little\nfrightened.\n\nBut Mama had a philosophy: a boy should face up to his fears. She'd been\nterrified of spiders when she was a girl, and she told me that she had made a\npoint of picking up every spider she saw and letting it crawl around on her\nface. After a year of that, she said, she never met a spider that frightened\nher.\n\nMama had been sending me to the store more and more, too, and having Mr\nJohnstone over for dinner every Friday night. She knew I didn't like him one\nlittle bit, and she said that I would just have to learn to live with what I\ndidn't like, and if that was the only thing I learned from her, it would be\nenough.\n\nI preferred the horsebarn.\n\nI worked close to the door the first day, which is no way to do it, of course:\nif you blocked the door, it just made it harder to get at the back when the time\ncame. The way to do it is to first clear out whatever hay is left over, move it\nout to the pasture, and then fill in from the back forward.\n\nMama told me so, that first night, when she came out to inspect my work. \"You\nsure must love working out here,\" she said. \"If you do it that way, you'll be\nout here stacking for twice as long. Well, you have your fun, but I still expect\nyou to be getting your homework and regular chores done. Come in and clean up\nfor supper now.\"\n\nI jammed the pitchfork into a bale, and washed for supper.\n\nThe next afternoon, I resolved to do it right. I moved the bales I'd stacked up\nby the door to a corner, and then started cleaning out the back. Before long,\nI'd uncovered the door into 1975. \"James,\" Mama called, from the house.\n\"Dinner!\"\n\nI took a long look at the door. The wood on the edges had aged to the\nsilvery-brown of the rest of the barn-boards, and it looked like it had been\nthere forever. I could hardly remember a time when it wasn't there.\n\nI went in for supper.\n\nThe next morning, I picked up my lunch and my schoolbooks, kissed Mama good-bye,\nand walked out. I stood on our porch for a long time, staring at the horsebarn.\nI remembered the brave explorers in Verne's books. I looked over my shoulder, at\nthe closed door of our house, then walked slowly to the horsebarn. I swung the\ndoor open, then walked to the back. The triple-bolts had rusted somewhat and\ntook real shoving to slide back. One of them was stubborn, so I picked up the\nrake and pried it back with the handle, thinking of how ingenious that was.\n\nI gave the door my shoulder and shoved, and it swung back, complaining on its\nhinges. On the other side was the still-familiar dark of our 1975 apartment. I\nstepped into it, and closed the door behind me.\n\n\"Lights,\" I said, and they came on.\n\nThe old place was just like the day we left it. It wasn't even dusty, and as I\nheard the familiar trundle of the robutler, I knew why. My Pa's easy chair sat\nin the parlour, with a print-out of the day's _Salt Lake City Bugler_ folded on\nthe side-table. I walked to one wall and laid my palm against it, the familiar\ncool glassy stuff it was made of. \"Window,\" I said, and wiped a line across the\nwall. Wherever my hand wiped went transparent. It was a sunny day in 1975 --\n1980, by then, but it would be 75 in my mind forever. Under the dome, Greater\nSalt Lake was warm and tranquil. I saw boys my age scooting around in jet-packs,\ndodging hover-traffic.\n\nPa liked to open a big, square window when he came home, and sit in his easy\nchair and smoke a stinky cigar and read the paper and cluck over it -- \"Well,\nwell, well,\" he'd say, and \"How _about_ that?\" Sometimes, he'd have a tumbler of\nwhiskey. He'd given me some, once, and the stuff had burned like turpentine and\nI swore I wouldn't try it again for a long, long time.\n\nI sat in Pa's easy chair and snapped up the newspaper, the way he used to.\n\"Panorama,\" I said, and Pa's square window opened before me. \"Whiskey,\" I said,\nand \"Cigar,\" because I was never one for half-measures. The robutler trundled\nover to me with a tumbler and a White Owl in its hover-field. I plucked them\nout. Cautiously, I put the cigar between my lips. The robutler extruded a long,\nsnaky arm with a flame, and lit it. I took a deep puff, and coughed\nconvulsively. Unthinking, I took a gulp of whiskey. I felt like my lungs had\nturned inside-out.\n\nI finished both the whiskey and the cigar before I got up, taking cautious puffs\nand tiny sips, forcing myself.\n\nMy head swam, and nausea nearly drowned me. I staggered into the WC, and hung my\nhead in the oubliette for an eternity, but nothing was coming up. I moved into\nmy old bedroom and splayed out on my bed, watching the ceiling spin. \"Lights,\" I\nmanaged to croak, and the room went dark.\n\n#\n\nWhen I woke in the morning, the walls were at half-opacity, the normal 0700\nschedule, and I dragged myself out of bed.\n\nThe robutler had extruded the table and set out my breakfast, ham and eggs and a\nbig bulb of milk. One look at it sent me over the edge, and I left a trail of\nsick all the way to the WC.\n\nWhen I was done, I was as wrung-out as a washcloth. My head pounded. The\nrobutler was quietly cleaning up my mess. I started to order it to clear away\nbreakfast, but discovered that I was miraculously hungry. I ate everything on\nthe table and seconds, besides, and had the robutler juice my temples and clear\naway my headache. I dialed the walls to full transparency, and watched the\ntraffic go by.\n\nThe robutler maneuvered itself into my field of vision and flashed a clock on\nits chest-plate: 0800 0800 0800. It was my old school-alarm. It snapped me back\nto reality. My Mama was going to whip me raw! She must've been worried sick.\n\nI stood up and ran for the door. It was closed. I punched my code into its\npanel, and waited. Nothing happened. I calmed myself and punched it again. Still\nnothing. After trying it a hundred times, I convinced myself that it had been\nchanged.\n\nI summoned the robutler and asked it for the code. Its chest-panel lit up: BAD\nPROGRAM.\n\nThat's when I started to really worry. I was near to tears when I remembered the\nemergency override. I punched it in.\n\nNothing happened.\n\nI think I started crying around then. I was stuck in 1975!\n\n#\n\nI'm not a stupid little kid. I didn't spend much time pewling. Instead, I went\nto the phone and dialed the police. The screen stayed blank. Feeling like I was\nin a dream, I went to the teleporter and dialed for my old school and stepped\nin. I failed to teleport.\n\nReality sank in.\n\nAll outside services to the apartment had been shut off when we moved out. The\nonly things that still worked were the ones that ran off our reactor, a squat\narmoured box on the apartment's underbelly. The door in New Jerusalem worked,\nbut on the 1975 side, it needed to communicate with the central office to\napprove any passage.\n\nI thought about sitting tight and waiting. Mama would be sick with worry, and\nwould check the barn eventually and see the shot bolts. She'd speak to Mr\nJohnstone, who would send a telegram to Paris, and they would relay the message\nto 1975, and _voila_, I'd be rescued. I'd get the whipping of my life, and do\nextra chores until I was seventy, but it was better than starving to death after\nthe apartment's pantry ran out. I felt hungry just thinking about it.\n\nStill, there was a better way. The null-gee doughnut that our apartment was\nspoked into had a supply of escape-jumpers, single-use jet-packs with a simple\ntransponder that screamed for help on all the emergency channels. I could ride\none of these down into Greater Salt Lake, wait for the police. The more I\nthought about this plan, the better it sounded. Better, anyway, than sitting\naround like a fairytale princess, waiting for rescue. In my mind, I was the\nrescuing type, not the kind that needed rescuing.\n\nBesides, there wasn't much better than riding around in one of those jet-packs.\n\nI cycled the emergency lock into the doughnut, unracked a pack and a jumpsuit\nthat looked like it would fit me, and suited up. The packed whined as it powered\nup and ran through its diagnostics. I checked the idiot-lights to make sure they\nwere all green, feeling like a real man of action, then I stepped into the\nexterior lock and jumped, arms and legs streamlined, toes pointed.\n\nThe jet-pack coughed to life and kicked me gently, then started lowering me to\nthe ground. The emergency beacon's idiot-light came on, and I heaved a sigh of\nrelief and got comfortable.\n\nThe flight was peaceful and dreamlike, a slow descent over the gleaming metal\ncity. I was so engrossed with the view that I didn't see the packjackers until\nthey were already on me. They hit me high and low, two kids about my age with\ntricked-out custom jet-packs with their traffic beacons broken off. One snagged\nmy knees and hugged them to his chest, while the other took me at the armpits. A\nvoice shouted in my ear: \"I'm cutting your pack loose. This is a very, very\nsharp knife, and when I'm done, I'll be the only thing holding you up. _Don't\nsquirm_.\"\n\nI didn't even have the chance to squirm. By the time the speech was finished, I\nwas separated from my pack, and I spun over upside-down, and watched it continue\nits descent, straps dangling in the wind. My hair hung down, and blood filled my\nhead, reawakening my headache. Reflexively, I twisted to get a look at my\nkidnappers, but stopped immediately as I felt their grips loosen. I squeezed my\neyes shut and prayed.\n\nThe three of us dove fast and hard, and I tasted that second helping of\nbreakfast again before we leveled off. I risked a peek, then squeezed my eyes\nshut again. We were speeding through the lower levels of Greater Salt Lake, the\nunmanned freight corridors, impossibly claustrophobic, and at our speed,\ndangerous.\n\nWe cornered tightly so many times that I lost count, and then we slowed to a\nstop. They dumped me to the ground, steel traction-plate. The wind was knocked\nout of me, and I was barely conscious of the hands that untabbed my jumpsuit,\nthen began methodically turning out the pockets of my clothes.\n\n\"What the hell are you wearing, kid?\" one of them asked. It was the same one\nwho'd warned me about squirming. Hearing his voice a second time, I realised\nthat he was younger than I was, maybe ten or eleven. Even then, it didn't occur\nto me to fight back -- he had a knife sharp enough to cut through the safety\nstrapping on my pack.\n\n\"Clothes. I'm from 1898 -- my Pa's an ambassador. I don't have any money.\" I\nstruggled into a sitting position, and was knocked onto my back again.\n\n\"Stay down and you won't get hurt,\" the same voice said. It was young enough\nthat I couldn't tell if it was a boy or a girl. Small hands pressed into my\neyes. \"No peeking, now.\"\n\nAnother set of hands systematically rifled my coat and pants, then cut them\nloose and gave the same treatment to my underpants and shirt. I blushed as they\nwere cut loose, too.\n\n\"You really don't have any money!\" the voice said.\n\n\"I said so, didn't I?\"\n\nThe voice said a dirty word that would've gotten it beaten black-and-blue back\nhome, and then the hands were gone. I looked up just in time to see two small\nfigures jetting away upwards.\n\nI was naked, sitting on a catwalk above a freight corridor, three-quarters of a\ncentury and God-knew-how-many miles from home. I didn't cry. I was too worried\nto cry. I kicked my ruined clothes down into the freight corridor and pulled on\nthe jumpsuit.\n\nSome hero I was!\n\n#\n\nIt was hard work, climbing staircase after staircase, up to the shopping levels.\nBy the time I reached a level where I could see the sky, I was dripping with\nsweat and my headache had returned.\n\nFoot traffic was light, but what there was pretty frightening. I'd gone walking\nin 75 before of course, but Greater Salt Lake was a big place, and there were\nparts of it that an Ambassador's son would never get to see.\n\nThis was one of them. The shopfronts were all iris-open airlocks, and had been\npainted around to look like surprised mouths, or eyes, or, in one fascinating\ncase, a woman's private parts. Mostly, they were betting shops, or bars, or\nlow-rent bounceaterias. Even in 1975, the Saints had some influence in Salt\nLake, and the bars and brothels were pretty shameful places, where no\nrespectable person would be caught.\n\nThe other pedestrians on the street were mostly off-worlders, either spacers in\nuniform or extees. In some cases, it was hard to tell which was which.\n\nI kind of slunk along, sticking to the walls, hands in my pockets. I kept my\neyes down, except when I was looking around for a public phone. After several\nblocks, I realised that no one was paying any attention to me, and I took my\nhands out of my pockets. The sun filtered down over me, warm through the big\ndome, and I realised that even though I'd gotten myself stuck in 75, been\n'jacked, and left in the worst neighbourhood in the whole State, I'd landed on\nmy feet. The thought made me smile. Another kid, say Oly, wouldn't have coped\nnearly as well.\n\nI still hadn't spied a public phone. I figured that the taprooms would have a\nphone, otherwise, how could a drunk call his wife and tell her he was going to\nbe late coming home? I picked a bar, whose airlock was painted to look like a\nbrick tunnel, and walked in.\n\nThe airlock irised shut behind me and I blinked in the gloom. My nose was\nassaulted with sickly sweet incense, and stale liquor, and cigar smoke.\n\nThe place was tiny, and crowded with dented metal tables and chairs that were\nbolted to the floorplates. A woman stood behind the bar, looking hard and brassy\nand cheap, watching a soap opera on her vid. A spacer sat in one corner, staring\nat his bulb of beer.\n\nThe bartender looked up. \"Get lost, kid,\" she said. \"No minors allowed.\"\n\n\"Sorry, ma'am,\" I said. \"I just wanted to use your telephone. I was packjacked,\nand I need to call the police.\"\n\nThe bartender turned back to her soap opera. \"Go peddle it somewhere else,\nsonny. The phone's for customers only.\"\n\n\"Please,\" I said. \"My father's an ambassador, from 1898? I don't have any money,\nand I'm stuck here. I won't be a minute.\"\n\nThe spacer looked up from his drink. \"Get lost, the lady said,\" he slurred at\nme.\n\n\"I'll buy something,\" I said.\n\n\"You just said you don't have any money,\" the bartender said.\n\n\"I'll pay for it when the police get here. The Embassy will cover it.\"\n\n\"No credit,\" she said.\n\n\"You're not going to let me use your phone?\" I said.\n\n\"That's right,\" she said, still staring at her vid.\n\n\"I'm a stranger, an ambassador's son, who's been robbed. A kid. Stuck here,\nbroke and alone, and you won't let me use your phone to call the police?\"\n\n\"That's about the size of things,\" she said.\n\n\"Well, I guess my Pa was right. The whole world went to hell after 1914. No\nmanners, no human decency.\"\n\n\"You're breaking my heart,\" she said.\n\n\"Fine. Be that way. Send me back out on the street, deny me a favour that won't\ncost you one red cent, just because I'm a stranger.\"\n\n\"Shut _up_, kid, for chrissakes,\" the spacer said. \"I'll stand him to a Coke, if\nthat's what it takes. Just let him use the phone and get out of here. He's\ngiving me a headache.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" I said, politely.\n\nThe bartender switched her vid over to phone mode, poured me a Coke, and handed\nme the vid.\n\n#\n\nThe policeman who showed up a few minutes later stuck me in the back of his\ncruiser, listened to my story, scanned my retinas, confirmed my identity, and\nretracted the armour between the back and front seats.\n\n\"I'll take you to the station house,\" he said. \"We'll contact your Embassy, let\nthem handle it from there.\"\n\n\"What about the kids who 'jacked me?\" I asked.\n\nThe cop turned the jetcar's conn over to wire-fly mode and turned around. \"You\ngot any description?\"\n\n\"Well, they had really nice packs on, with the traffic beacons snapped off. One\nwas red, and I think the other was green. And they were young. Ten or eleven.\"\n\nThe cop punched at his screen. \"Kid,\" he said, \"I got over three million minors\neight to eleven, flying packs less than a year old. The most popular colour is\nred. Second choice, green. Where would you like me to start? Alphabetically?\"\n\n\"Sorry, sir, I didn't realise.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" he said. \"Whatever.\"\n\n\"I guess I'm not thinking very clearly. It's been a long day.\"\n\nThe cop looked over to me and smiled. \"I guess it has, at that. Don't worry,\nkid, we'll get you home all right.\"\n\n#\n\nThey gave me a fresh jumpsuit, sat me on a bench, called the embassy, and forgot\nabout me. A long, boring time later, a fat man with walrus moustaches and ruddy\nskin showed up.\n\n\"On your feet, lad,\" he said. \"I'm Pondicherry, your father's successor. You've\nmade quite a mess of things, haven't you?\" He had a clipped, British accent,\nwith a hint of something else. I remembered Mr Johnstone saying he'd been in\nIndia. He wore a standard unisex jumpsuit, with his ambassadorial sash overtop\nof it. He looked ridiculous.\n\n\"Sorry to have disturbed you, sir,\" I said.\n\n\"I'm sure you are,\" he said. \"Come along, we'll see about fixing this mess.\"\n\nHe used the station's teleporter to bring me to his apartment. It was as\nridiculous as his uniform, and in the same way. He'd taken the basic elegant\nsimplicity of a standard 1975 unit and draped all kinds of silly trophies and\nmodels overtop of it: lions' heads and sabers and model ships and framed medals\nand savage masks and dolls.\n\n\"You may look, but not touch, do you understand me?\" he said, as we stepped out\nof the teleporter.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" I said. If anyone else had said it, I would have been offended, but\ncoming from this puffed-up pigeon, it didn't sting much.\n\nHe went to a vid and punched impatiently at the screen while I prowled the\napartment. The bookcase was full of old friends, books by the Frenchman, of\ncourse, and more, with strange names like Wells and Burroughs and Shelley. I\nlooked over a long, stone-headed spear, and the curve of an elephant's tusk, and\na collection of campaign ribbons and medals under glass. I returned to the\nbookcase: something had been bothering me. There, there it was: \"War of the\nWorlds,\" the book that Mr Adelson had given me for Christmas. But there was\nsomething wrong with the spine of this one: instead of _Jules Verne_, the author\nname was _H.G. Wells_. I snuck a look over my shoulder; Pondicherry was still\nstabbing at the screen. I snuck the book off the shelf and turned to the title\npage: \"War of the Worlds, by Herbert George Wells.\" I turned to the first\nchapter:\n\nThe Eve of the War\n\nNo one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this\nworld was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man's\nand yet as mortal as his own; that as men busied themselves about their various\nconcerns they were scrutinised and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man\nwith a microscope might scrutinise the transient creatures that swarm and\nmultiply in a drop of water.\n\nIt was just as I remembered it, every word, just as it was in the Verne. I\ncouldn't begin to explain it.\n\nA robutler swung out of its niche with a sheaf of papers. I startled at the\nnoise, then reflexively stuck the book in my jumpsuit. The roboutler delivered\nthem to Pondicherry, who stuffed them in a briefcase.\n\n\"The embassy will be able to return you home by courier route in three hours.\nUnfortunately, I don't have the luxury of waiting around here until then. I have\nan important meeting to attend -- you'll have to come along.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" I said, trying to sound eager and helpful.\n\n\"Don't say anything, don't touch anything. This is very sensitive.\"\n\n\"No, sir, I won't. Thank you, sir.\"\n\n#\n\nThe meeting was in a private room in a fancy restaurant, one that I'd been to\nbefore for an embassy Christmas party. Mama had drunk two glasses of sherry, and\nhad flushed right to the neck of her dress. We'd had roast beef, and a goose\nwrapped inside a huge squash, the size of a barrel, like they grew on the Moon.\n\nPondicherry whisked through the lobby, and the main dining room, and then up a\nnarrow set of stairs, without checking to see if I was following. I dawdled a\nlittle, remembering Pa laughing and raising his glass in toast after toast.\n\nI caught up with Pondicherry just as he was ordering, speaking brusquely into\nthe table. Another man sat opposite him. Pondicherry looked up at me and said,\n\"Have you dined, boy?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\nHe ordered me a plate of calf livers in cream sauce, which is about the worst\nthing you can feed a boy, if you ask me, which he didn't. \"Sit down,\" he said.\n\"Mr Nussbaum, Master James Nicholson. I am temporarily in _loco parentis_, until\nhe can be sent home.\"\n\nNussbaum smiled and extended his hand. He was wearing a grey suit, with a\nstrange cut, and a black tie. His fingers dripped with heavy gold rings, and his\nhair, while short, still managed to look fancy and a little sissy-fied. \"Good to\nmeetcha, son. You Lester's boy?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, he was my Pa.\"\n\n\"Good man. A damned shame. What are you doing here? Playing hooky?\"\n\n\"I guess I just got lost. I'm going home, soon as they can get me there.\"\n\n\"Is that so? Well, I'll be sad to see you go. You look like a smart kid. You\nlike chocolate cake, I bet.\"\n\n\"Sometimes,\" I said.\n\n\"Like when?\"\n\n\"When my mama makes it, with a glass of milk, after school,\" I said.\n\nHe laughed, a strangled har-har-har. \"You guys kill me. Your mama, huh? Well,\nthey make some fine chocolate cake here, though it may not be as good as the\nstuff from home.\" He thumbed the table. \"Sweetie, send up the biggest piece of\nchocolate cake you got down there, and a glass a milk, willya?\"\n\nThe table acknowledged his request with a soft green light.\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" I said.\n\n\"That's quite enough, I think,\" Pondicherry said. \"I didn't come here to watch\nyou rot young James's teeth. Can we get to business?\"\n\nPondicherry started talking, in rapid, clipped sentences, punctuated by vicious\nbites of his food. I tried to follow what it was about -- trading buffalo steaks\nfor rare metals, I got that much, but not much more. The calves' livers were\nworse than I imagined, and I hid as much of them as I could under the potatoes,\nthen pushed the plate away and dug into the cake.\n\nI sneaked a look up and saw that Nussbaum was grinning slyly at me. He hadn't\nsaid much, just ate calmly and waited for Pondicherry to run out of steam. He\ncaught my eye and slipped a wink at me. I looked over at Pondicherry, who was\nnoisily cudding a piece of steak, oblivious, and winked back at Nussbaum.\n\nPondicherry daubbed at his mouth with his napkin. \"Excuse me,\" he said, \"I'll be\nright back.\" He stood and walked towards the WC.\n\nNussbaum suddenly jingled. Distractledly, he patted his pockets until he located\na tiny phone. He flipped it open and grunted \"Nussbaum,\" into it.\n\n\"Jules!\" he said a moment later. \"How're things?\"\n\nHe scowled as he listened to the answer. \"Now, you and I know that there's a\ndifference between _smart_ and _greedy_. I think it's a bad idea.\"\n\nHe listened some more and drummed his fingers on the table.\n\n\"Because it's not _credible_, dammit! Even the title is anachronistic: no one in\n1902 is going to understand what _Neuromancer_ means. Think about it, wouldya?\nWhy don't you do some of Twain's stuff? Those books've got _legs_.\"\n\nMy jaw dropped. Nussbaum was talking to the Frenchman -- and he was helping him\nto _cheat_! To steal from Mark Twain! I was suddenly conscious of \"War of the\nWorlds,\" down the front of my jumpsuit. I thought back to Mr Adelson's\nassignment, and it all made sudden sense. Verne was a _plagiarist_.\n\nNussbaum hung up just as Pondicherry re-seated himself. He took a sip of his\ndrink, then held up a hand. Pondicherry eyed him coldly.\n\n\"Look,\" Nussbaum said. \"We've gone over this a few times, OK? I know where you\nstand. You know where I stand. We're not standing in the same place. Much as I\nenjoy your company, I don't really wanna spend the whole day listening to you\nrepeating yourself. All right?\"\n\n\"Really, I don't think --\" Pondicherry started, but Nussbaum held up his hand\nagain.\n\n\"That's all right, I'm a rude son-of-a-bitch, and I know it. Let's just take it\nas read that you and me spent the whole afternoon letting the other fella know\nhow sincere our positions are. Then we can move onto cocktails, and compromise,\nand maybe have some of the day left over.\" Pondicherry started to talk again,\nbut Nussbaum plowed over him. \"I'll go to six troy ounces per steer. You won't\nget a better offer. 98% pure ores. Better than anything you'd ever refine back\nhome. It's as far as I go.\"\n\n\"Sir, is that an ultimatum?\" Pondicherry asked, his eyes narrowing.\n\n\"Call it whatever you please, buster. It's my final, iron-clad offer. You don't\nlike it, I can talk to the Chinaman. He seemed pretty eager to get some good\nmetal home to the Emperor.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't -- he's too far back, it would violate the protocols.\"\n\n\"That's what you say. It may be what the trade court decides. I'll take my\nchances.\"\n\n\"Six and a half ounces,\" Pondicherry said, in a spoiled-brat voice.\n\n\"You don't hear so good, do you? Six ounces is the offer on the table; take it\nor leave it.\" Nussbaum pushed some papers across the table.\n\nPondicherry stared at them for a long moment. \"I will sign them, sir, but it is\nwith the expectation of continued trade opportunities. This is a good-will\ngesture, do you understand?\"\n\nNussbaum snorted and reached for his papers. \"This is about steaks and metals.\nThis isn't about the future, it's about today, now. That's what's on the table.\nYou can sign it, or you can walk away.\"\n\nPondicherry blew air out his nose like a crazy horse, and signed. \"If you'll\nexcuse me, I need to use the WC again.\" He rose and left the room, purple from\nthe collar up.\n\n\"What a maroon,\" Nussbaum said to the closed door. \"This's gotta be a real blast\nfor you, huh?\" he said.\n\nI grinned. \"It's not so bad. I liked watchin' you hogtie him.\"\n\nHe laughed. \"I never would've tried that on your father, kid. He was too sharp.\nBut fatso there, he's terrified the Chinaman will give the Middle Kingdom an\nedge when it faces down his Royal Navy. All it takes is the slightest hint, and\nhe folds like a cheap suit.\"\n\nThat made me chuckle -- a cheap suit!\n\nI gave him my best innocent look. \"Who else knows about the Frenchman?\" I asked\nhim.\n\nNussbaum grinned like he'd been caught with his hand in the cookie jar. \"I\nrealised about halfway through that conversation that being Lester's boy, you've\nprobably read just about every word old Jules 'wrote.'\"\n\n\"I have,\" I said. I took out \"War of the Worlds.\" \"How does Mr Wells feel about\nthis?\" I asked.\n\n\"I imagine he's pretty mystified,\" Nussbaum said. \"Would you believe, you're the\nfirst one who's caught on?\"\n\nI believed it. I knew enough to know that the agencies that policed the\nprotocols had their hands full keeping track of art and gold smugglers. I'd\nnever even thought of smuggling _words_. If the trade courts found out. . .\nWell, hardly a week went by that someone didn't propose shutting down the\nambassadorships; they'd talk about how the future kept on leaking pastwards, and\nif we thought 1975 looked bad, imagine life in 1492 once the future reached it!\nThe ambassadors had made a lot of friends in high places, though: they used\ntheir influence to keep things on an even keel.\n\nNussbaum raised an eyebrow and studied me. \"I think your father may've figured\nit out, but he kept it to himself. He and Jules got along like a house on fire.\"\n\nI kept the innocent look on my face. \"Well, then,\" I said. \"If Pa didn't say\nanything, you'd think that I wouldn't either, right?\"\n\nNussbaum sighed and gave me a sheepish look. \"I'd _like_ to think so,\" he said.\n\nI turned the book over in my hands, keeping my gaze locked with his. I was about\nto tell him that I'd keep it to myself, but at the last minute, some instinct\ntold me to keep my mouth shut.\n\nNussbaum shrugged as though to say, _I give up_. \"Hey, you're headed home today,\nright?\" he said, carefully.\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"I've got a message that you could maybe relay for me, you think?\"\n\n\"I guess so. . .\" I said, doubtfully.\n\n\"I'll make it worth your while. It's got to go to a friend of mine in Frisco.\nThere's no hurry -- just make sure he gets it in the next ten years or so. Once\nyou deliver it, he'll take care of you -- you'll be set for life.\"\n\n\"Gosh,\" I said, deadpan.\n\n\"Are you game?\"\n\n\"I guess so. Sure.\" My heart skipped. Set for life!\n\n\"The man you want to speak to is Reddekop, he's the organist at the Castro\ntheatre. Tell him: 'Nussbaum says get out by October 29th, 1929.' He'll know\nwhat it means. You got that?\"\n\n\"Reddekop, Castro Theatre. October 29th, 1929.\"\n\n\"Exac-atac-ally.\" He slid \"War of the Worlds\" into his briefcase. \"You're doin'\nme a hell of a favour, son.\"\n\nHe shook my hand. Pondicherry came back in then, and glared at me. \"The embassy\ncontacted me. They can set you at home six months after you left -- there's a\ncourier gateway this afternoon.\"\n\n\"Six months!\" I said. \"My Mama will go crazy! Can't you get me home any sooner?\"\n\nPondicherry smirked. \"Don't complain to me, boy. You dug this hole yourself. The\nnext scheduled courier going anywhere near your departure-point is in five\nyears. We'll send notice to your mother then, to expect you home mid-July.\"\n\n\"Tough break, kiddo,\" Nussbaum said, and he shook my hand and slipped me another\nwink.\n\n#\n\nThe courier gateway let me out in an alleyway in Salt Lake City. The embassy had\ngiven me ten Wells Fargo dollars, and fitted me out with a pair of jeans and a\nworkshirt that were both far too big for me, so that they slopped around me as I\nmade my way to the train station and bought my ticket to New Jerusalem.\n\nIt was Wednesday, the normal schedule for the Zephyr Speedball, so I didn't have\ntoo long to wait at the station. I bought copies of the Salt Lake City _Shout_,\nand the San Francisco _Chronicle_ from a passing newsie. The _Chronicle_ was a\nweek old, but it was filled with all sorts of fascinating big-city gossip. I\nread it cover-to-cover on the long ride to New Jerusalem.\n\nMama met me at the train station. I'd been expecting a switching, right then and\nthere, but instead she hugged me fiercely with tears in her eyes. I remembered\nthat it had been over six months for her since I'd gone.\n\n\"James, you will be the death of me, I swear,\" she said, after she'd squeezed\nevery last bit of stuffing out of me.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Mama,\" I said.\n\n\"We had to tell everyone you'd gone away to school in France,\" a familiar male\nvoice said. I looked up and saw Mr Johnstone standing a few yards away, with our\nteam and trap. He was glaring at me. \"I've had the barn gateway sealed\npermanently on both sides.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, sir,\" I said. But inside, I wasn't. Even though I'd only been away\nfor a few days, I'd had the adventure of a lifetime: smoked and drank and been\n'jacked and escaped and received a secret message. My Mama seemed shorter to me,\nand frailer, and James H Johnstone was a puffed-up nothing of a poltroon.\n\n\"We'll put it behind us, son,\" he said. \"But from now on, there will be order in\nour household, do we understand each-other?\"\n\n_Our_ house? I looked up sharply at my Mama. She smiled at me, nervously. \"We\nmarried, James. A month ago. Congratulate me!\"\n\nI thought about it. My Mama needed someone around to take care of her, and\nvice-versa. After all, it wasn't right for her to be all alone. With a start, I\nrealised that in my mind, I'd left my Mama's house. I felt the Wells-Fargo notes\nin my pocket.\n\n\"Congratulations, Mama. Congratulations, Mr Johnstone.\"\n\nMama hugged me again and the Mr Johnstone drove us home in the trap.\n\n#\n\nAll through the rest of the day, Mama kept looking worriedly at me, whenever she\nthought I wasn't watching. I pretended not to notice, and did my chores, then\ntook my _Chronicle_ out to the apple orchard behind the Academy. I sat beneath a\nbig, shady tree and re-read the paper, all the curious bits and pieces of a city\nfrozen in time.\n\nI was hardly surprised to see Mr Adelson, nor did he seem surprised to see me.\n\n\"Back from France, James?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Looks like it did you some good, though I must say, we missed you around the\nAcademy. It just wasn't the same. Have you been keeping up your writing?\"\n\n\"Sorry, sir, I haven't. There hasn't been time. I'm thinking about writing an\nadventure story, though -- about pirates and space-travellers and airships,\" I\nsaid.\n\n\"That sound exciting.\" He sat down beside me, and we sat there in silence for a\ntime, watching the flies buzz around. The air was sweet with apple blossoms, and\nthe only sound was the wind in the trees.\n\n\"I'm going to miss this place,\" I said, unthinking.\n\n\"Me, too,\" Mr Adelson said.\n\nOur eyes locked, and a slow smile spread over his face. \"Well, I know where\n_I'm_ going, but where are you off to, son?\"\n\n\"You're going away?\" I said.\n\n\"Yes, sir. Is that a copy of the _Chronicle_? Give it here, I'll show you\nsomething.\"\n\nHe flipped through the pages, and pointed to an advertisement. \"The _Slippery\nTrick_ is in port, and they're signing on crew for a run through the south seas,\nin September. I intend to go as Quartermaster.\"\n\n\"You're leaving?\" I said, shocked to my boots.\n\nTo my surprise, he pulled out a pouch of tobacco and some rolling papers and\nrolled himself a cigarette. I'd never seen a schoolteacher smoking before. He\ntook a thoughtful puff and blew the smoke out into the sky. \"To tell you the\ntruth, James, I just don't think I'm cut out for this line of work. Not enough\nexcitement in a town like this. I've never been happier than I was when I was at\nsea, and that's as good a reason to go back as any. I'll miss you, though, son.\nYou were a delight to teach.\"\n\n\"But what will I do?\" I said.\n\n\"Why, I expect your mother will send you back East to go to school. I graduated\nyou from the Academy _in absentia_ during the last week of classes. Your report\ncard and diploma are waiting on my desk.\"\n\n\"Graduated?\" I said, shocked. I had another year to go at the Academy.\n\n\"Don't look so surprised! There was no earthly reason for you to stay at the\nAcademy. I'd say you were ready for college, myself. Maybe Harvard!\" He tousled\nmy hair.\n\nI allowed myself a smile -- I didn't think I was any smarter than the other\nkids, but I sure knew a whole lot more about the world -- the worlds! And maybe,\nin my heart of hearts, I knew that I was a _little_ smarter. \"I'll miss you,\nsir,\" I said.\n\n\"Call me Robert. School's out. Where are you off to, James?\"\n\nI gestured with my copy of the _Chronicle_.\n\n\"My home town! Whatever for?\"\n\nI looked at my shoes.\n\n\"Oh, a secret. I see. Well, I won't pry. Does your mother know about this?\"\n\nI felt like kicking myself. If I said no, he'd have to tell her. If I said yes,\nI'd only have myself to blame if he spilled the news to her. I looked at him,\nand he blew a streamer of smoke into the sky. \"No, sir,\" I said. \"No, Robert.\"\n\nHe looked at me. He winked. \"Better keep it to ourselves, then,\" he said.\n\n#\n\nThe ticket-girl at the Castro Theatre wasn't any older than I was, but she wore\nher hair shorter than some of the boys I'd known back home, and more makeup than\neven the painted ladies at the saloon. She looked at me like I was some kind of\nsmall-town fool. It was a look I was getting used to seeing.\n\n\"Reddekop only plays for the _evening_ shows, kid. No organ for the _matinee_.\"\n\n\"Who you calling a kid?\" I said. I'd kept a civil tongue ever since debarking\nthe train, treating adult and kid with equal respect, but I was getting sick of\nbeing treated like a yokel. I'd been farther than any of these dusty slickers\nwould ever go, and I was grown enough that I'd told my Mama and Mr Johnstone\nthat I was going off on my own, instead of just leaving a note like I'd\noriginally planned.\n\n\"You. Kid. You want to talk to Reddekop, you come back after six. In the\nmeantime, you can either buy a ticket to the matinee or get lost.\"\n\nOn reflection, telling my Mama was probably a mistake. It meant that I was\nlocked in my room for two consecutive Wednesdays so that I couldn't catch the\ntrain. On the third Wednesday, I climbed out onto the roof and then went down\nthe rope-ladder I'd hidden behind a chimney. The Wells Fargo notes I'd started\nwith were almost gone, mostly spent on the expensive food on the train -- I\nhadn't dared try to sneak any food away from home, my Mama was no fool.\n\nI thought about buying a ticket to the matinee. I still had almost five dollars,\nbut a quick look at the menus in the restaurants had taught me that if I thought\nthe food on the train was expensive, I had another think coming. I shouldered my\nrucksack and wandered away, taking care to avoid the filth from dogs and people\nthat littered the sidewalks. I told myself that I wasn't homesick -- just tired.\n\n#\n\n\"October 29, 1929, huh?\" Reddekop was a small German with a greying spade beard\nand a heavily oiled part in his long hair. His fingers were long and nimble, but\nnearly everything else about him was short and crude. He made me nervous.\n\n\"Yes, sir. Mr Nussbaum thought you'd know what it meant.\"\n\nReddekop struck a match off the side of the organist's pit, lighted a pipe, then\ntossed the match carelessly into the theatre seats. I winced and he chuckled.\n\"Not to worry, kid. The place won't burn down for a few years yet. I have it on\nthe very best authority.\n\n\"Now, Nussbaum says October 29, 1929. What else does he say?\"\n\n\"He said that you'd take care of me.\"\n\nHe gripped the pipe in his yellow teeth and hissed a laugh around the stem. \"He\ndid, did he? Well, I suppose I should. Of course, I won't know for sure for more\nthan 25 years -- I don't suppose you want to wait that long?\"\n\n\"No, sir!\" I said. I didn't like this little man -- he reminded me of some kind\nof musical rat.\n\n\"I thought not. Do you know what a trust is, James?\"\n\nWe'd covered that in common law -- I could rattle off about thirty different\nkinds without blinking. \"I have a general idea,\" I said.\n\n\"Good, good. What I'm thinking is, the best thing is for me to set up a trust\nthrough a lawyer I know on Market Street. He'll make sure that you're always\nflush, but never so filthy that someone will take a notice in you. How does that\nstrike you?\"\n\nI thought it over. \"How do I know that the trust fund won't disappear in a few\nyears?\"\n\n\"You're nobody's fool, huh? Well, how about this -- you find your own advocate:\na lawyer, a bondsman, someone you trust, and he can look over all the books and\npapers, make sure it's all square-john. How does that strike you?\"\n\nReddekop knew I was a stranger in town, and maybe he was counting on my not\nbeing able to find anyone qualified to audit the trust, but I had an ace up my\nsleeve. I wasn't anybody's fool.\n\n\"That sounds fair,\" I said.\n\n#\n\nBack at my Mama's I'd had long hard days, doing chores: chopping wood, stacking\nhay, weeding the garden, carrying water. I'd go to bed bone-tired, limp as a rag\nand as exhausted as I thought I could be.\n\nBoy, was I wrong! By the time I found Mr Adelson's rooming house, I could barely\nstand, my mouth was dry as a salt-flat, and it was hard to keep my eyes open.\nThey've got hills in San Francisco that must've been some kind of joke God\nplayed. His landlady, a worn-out grey woman whose sour expression seemed\ndirected at everything and anything, let me in and pointed me up three rickety\nflights of stairs to Mr Adelson's room.\n\nI dragged my luggage up with me, bumping it on the stairs, and rapped on the\ndoor. Mr Adelson answered in the same shirtsleeves and suspenders I'd seen him\nin that Christmas, an age ago, when my Mama dragged me to his cottage. \"James!\"\nhe said.\n\n\"Mr Adelson,\" I said. \"Sorry to drop in like this.\"\n\nHe took my bag from me and ushered me into his room, pulling up a chair. \"What\non earth are you doing here?\" he said. \"Do your parents know where you are? Are\nyou all right? Have you eaten? Are you hungry?\"\n\n\"I'm pretty hungry -- I haven't eaten since supper last night on the train,\" I\ntried to make it sound jaunty, but I'm afraid it came out pretty\ntired-sounding.\"\n\n\"I'll fix us sandwiches,\" he said, and started fishing around his sea-chest. I\nwatched his shoulders move for a moment, and then my eyes closed.\n\n#\n\n\"Well, good morning,\" Mr Adelson said, as I sat bolt upright, disoriented in a\nstrange bed with a strange blanket. \"Coffee?\"\n\nHe was leaning over a little Sterno stove, heating up a small tin pot. Morning\nsun streamed in through the grimy window.\n\n\"I wrapped your sandwich up from last night. It's there, on the dresser.\"\n\nI stood up and saw that except for my shoes, I was still dressed. The sandwich\nwas salt beef and cheese, and the sourdough was stale, and it was the best thing\nI'd ever eaten. Mr Adelson handed me a tin cup full of strong coffee, and though\nI don't much like coffee, I found myself drinking it as fast as I could.\n\n\"Thank you, Mr Adelson,\" I said.\n\n\"Robert,\" he said, and sat down on the room's only chair. I perched on the bed's\nend. \"Well, you seem to have had quite a day! Let's hear about it.\"\n\nI told him as much as I could, fudging around some of the details -- my Mama\nsurely did know where I was, even if she wasn't very happy about it; and of\ncourse, I couldn't tell him that I'd met Nussbaum in 1975, so I just moved the\nlocale to France, and caged around what message he'd asked me to deliver to\nReddekop. It still made for a pretty exciting telling.\n\n\"So you want me to go to this lawyer's office with you? To look over the papers?\nJames, I'm just a sailor, I'm not qualified.\"\n\nI'd prepared for this argument, on the long slog to the rooming house. \"But _I_\nknow something about this; they won't believe it, though, and will slip all\nkinds of dirty tricks in if they think that the only fellow who'll be looking at\nit is just a kid.\"\n\n\"Explain to me again why you don't want to wire Mr Johnstone to come and look it\nover? It sounds like an awful lot of money for him not to be involved.\"\n\n\"He's not my Pa, Robert. I don't even _like_ him, and chances are, he'll hide\naway all that money until I'm eighteen or _twenty-one_, and try to send me off\nto school.\"\n\n\"And what's wrong with that? You have other plans?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" I said, too loudly -- I hadn't really worked that part out. I just knew\nthat the next time I set foot in New Jerusalem, I'd be my own man, a man of the\nworld, and not dependent on anyone. I'd take Mama and Mr Johnstone out for a big\nsupper, and stay in the fanciest room at the Stableman's hotel, and hire Tommy\nBenson to carry my bags to my room. \"Besides, I'm not asking you to do this for\n_free_. I'll pay you a -- an administrative fee. Five percent, _for life_!\"\n\nHe looked serious. \"James, if I do this -- mind I said _if_ -- I won't take a\nred cent. There are things here that you're not telling me. Now, that's your\nbusiness, but I want to make sure that if anyone ever scrutinises the affair,\nthat it's clear that I didn't receive any benefit from it.\"\n\nI smiled. I knew I had him -- if he'd thought it that far through, he wasn't\ngoing to say no. Besides, I hadn't even played my trump card yet: that if he\ndidn't help me, I'd be out on the streets on my own, and I could tell that he\ndidn't like that idea.\n\n#\n\nMr Adelson wore his teacher clothes for the affair and I wore the good breeches\nand shirt I'd packed. We stopped at a barber's before, Mr Adelson treated me to\na haircut from the number-two man while he took a shave and a trim. We boarded\nthe cablecar to Market like a couple of proper gentlemen, and if I thought\nflying in a jetpack was exciting, it was nothing compared to the terror of\nhanging on the running-board of a cablecar as it laboured up and then --\nquickly! -- down a monster hill.\n\nThe lawyer was a foreigner, a Frenchie or a Belgian, and his offices were grubby\nand filled with stinking cigar smoke and the din of the trolleys. He asked no\nembarrassing questions of me. He just sized up Mr Adelson, then put away the\npapers on his desk and presented a set from his briefcase, laying out the terms\nof the trust, and retreated from the office. I read over Mr Adelson's shoulder,\nthe terms scribbled in a hasty hand, but every word of it legal and binding,\nnear as I could tell.\n\nThe amounts in question were staggering. Two hundred dollars, every month!\nIndexed for inflation, for seventy years or the duration of my natural life,\nwhichever was lesser. The records of the trust to be deposited with the Wells\nFargo, subject to scrutiny on demand. Mr Adelson looked long and hard at me.\n\"James, I can't begin to imagine what sort of information you've traded for\nthis, but son, you're rich as Croesus!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" I said.\n\n\"Do these papers look legal to you?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"They seem legal to me, too.\"\n\nA bubble of excitement filled my chest and I had to restrain myself from\nbouncing on my heels. \"I'm going to sign it,\" I said. \"Will you witness it?\"\n\n\"I've got a better idea. Let's get that lawyer and take this down to the Wells\nFargo and have the President of the Bank witness it himself.\"\n\nAnd that's just what we did.\n\n#\n\nMr Adelson had spent the previous night on the floor, while I slept in his bed.\nMy first month's payment was tucked carefully in my pocket, and over his\nprotests, I pried loose a few bills and took my own room in the rooming house,\nand then the two of us ate out at a restaurant whose prices had seemed\nimpossibly out-of-reach the day before. We had oysters and steaks and I had a\nslab of apple pie for desert with fresh ice cream and peach syrup, and when I\nwas done, I felt like new man. Mr Adelson had a bottle of beer with dinner, and\na whiskey afterwards, and I insisted on paying.\n\n\"Well, then,\" he said, sipping his whiskey. \"You're a very well-set-up young\nman. What will you do now?\"\n\nAll throughout my scheming since my second return from 75, the prospect of what\nto do with all the money had niggled away at the back of my mind. All I knew for\nsure was that I didn't want to grow up in New Jerusalem. I wanted adventure,\nexotic places and people, danger and excitement. Over dinner, though, a plan had\nbeen forming in my head.\n\n\"Does the _Slippery Trick_ need a cabin-boy?\"\n\nHe shook his head and smiled at me. \"I was afraid it was something like that.\nSon, you could pay for a stateroom on a proper liner with all the money you\nhave. Why would you want to be in charge of chamber-pots on a leaky old tub?\"\n\n\"Why do you want to sail off on a leaky old tub instead of teaching in Utah, or\nworking on the trolleys here?\"\n\nIt took me most of the night to convince him, but there was no doubt in my mind\nthat I would, and when the ship sailed, that I'd be on it, with a big,\nleather-bound log, writing stories.\n\n--\n\n\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A PLACE SO FOREIGN***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 16721-8.txt or 16721-8.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/6/7/2/16721\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\n\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\nhttp://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\ndownload by the etext year.\n\nhttp://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06\n\n    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\n\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\n\nhttp://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234\n\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689\n\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.net/GUTINDEX.ALL\n\n*** END: FULL LICENSE ***\n"}
