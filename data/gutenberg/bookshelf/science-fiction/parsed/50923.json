Earth wanted no\n              \"shotgun weddings\" of the worlds of space!\n\n\n\"Split\" Campbell and I brought our ship down to a quiet landing on the\nsummit of a mile-wide naked rock, and I turned to the telescope for a\ncloser view of the strange thing we had come to see.\n\nIt shone, eighteen or twenty miles away, in the light of the late\nafternoon sun. It was a long silvery serpent-like _something_ that\ncrawled slowly over the planet's surface.\n\nThere was no way of guessing how large it was, at this distance. It\nmight have been a rope rolled into shape out of a mountain--or a chain\nof mountains. It might have been a river of bluish-gray dough that had\nshaped itself into a great cable. Its diameter? If it had been a hollow\ntube, cities could have flowed through it upright without bending their\nskyscrapers. It was, to the eye, an endless rope of cloud oozing along\nthe surface of the land. No, not cloud, for it had the compactness of\nsolid substance.\n\nWe could see it at several points among the low foothills. Even from\nthis distance we could guess that it had been moving along its course\nfor centuries. Moving like a sluggish snake. It followed a deep-worn\npath between the nearer hills and the high jagged mountains on the\nhorizon.\n\n_What was it?_\n\n\"Split\" Campbell and I had been sent here to learn the answers.\nOur sponsor was the well known \"EGGWE\" (the Earth-Galaxy Good\nWill Expeditions.) We were under the EGGWE Code. We were the first\nexpedition to this planet, but we had come equipped with two important\npieces of advance information. The Keynes-Roy roving cameras (unmanned)\nhad brought back to the Earth choice items of fact about various parts\nof the universe. From these photos we knew (1) that man lived on this\nplanet, a humanoid closely resembling the humans of the Earth; and\n(2) that a vast cylindrical \"rope\" crawled the surface of this land,\ncontinuously, endlessly.\n\nWe had intentionally landed at what we guessed would be a safe distance\nfrom the rope. If it were a living thing, like a serpent, we preferred\nnot to disturb it. If it gave off heat or poisonous gases or deadly\nvibrations, we meant to keep our distance. If, on the other hand, it\nproved to be some sort of vegetable--a vine of glacier proportions--or\na river of some silvery, creamy substance--we would move in upon it\ngradually, gathering facts as we progressed. I could depend upon\n\"Split\" to record all observable phenomena with the accuracy of\nsplit-hairs.\n\nSplit was working at the reports like a drudge at this very moment.\n\nI looked up from the telescope, expecting him to be waiting his turn\neagerly. I misguessed. He didn't even glance up from his books. Rare\nyoung Campbell! Always a man of duty, never a man of impulse!\n\n\"Here Campbell, take a look at the 'rope'.\"\n\n\"Before I finish the reports, sir? If I recall our Code, Section Two,\nOrder of Duties upon Landing: A--\"\n\n\"Forget the Code. Take a look at the rope while the sun's on it.... See\nit?\"\n\n\"Yes sir.\"\n\n\"Can you see it's moving? See the little clouds of dust coming up from\nunder its belly?\"\n\n\"Yes sir. An excellent view, Captain Linden.\"\n\n\"What do you think of it, Split? Ever see a sight like that before?\"\n\n\"No sir.\"\n\n\"Well, what about it? Any comments?\"\n\nSplit answered me with an enthusiastic, \"By gollies, sir!\" Then, with\nrestraint, \"It's precisely what I expected from the photographs, sir.\nAny orders, sir?\"\n\n\"Relax, Split! That's the order. Relax!\"\n\n\"Thanks--thanks, Cap!\" That was his effort to sound informal, though\ncoming from him it was strained. His training had given him an\nexaggerated notion of the importance of dignity and discipline.\n\nHe was naturally so conscientious it was painful. And to top it all,\nhis scientific habit of thought made him want to stop and weigh his\nwords even when speaking of casual things such as how much sugar he\nrequired in his coffee.\n\nNeedless to say, I had kidded him unmercifully over these traits.\nAcross the millions of miles of space that we had recently traveled\n(our first voyage together) I had amused myself at his expense. I\nhad sworn that he would find, in time, that he couldn't even trim\nhis fingernails without calipers, or comb his hair without actually\nphysically splitting the hairs that cropped up in the middle of the\npart. That was when I had nicknamed him \"Split\"--and the wide ears that\nstuck out from his stubble-cut blond hair had glowed with the pink of\nselfconsciousness. Plainly, he liked the kidding. But if I thought I\ncould rescue him from the weight of dignity and duty, I was mistaken.\n\nNow he had turned the telescope for a view far to the right. He paused.\n\n\"What do you see?\" I asked.\n\n\"I cannot say definitely. The exact scientific classification of the\nobject I am observing would call for more detailed scrutiny--\"\n\n\"You're seeing some sort of object?\"\n\n\"Yes sir.\"\n\n\"What sort of object?\"\n\n\"A living creature, sir--upright, wearing clothes--\"\n\n\"A _man_?\"\n\n\"To all appearances, sir--\"\n\n\"You bounder, give me that telescope!\"\n\n\n2.\n\nIf you have explored the weird life of many a planet, as I have, you\ncan appreciate the deep sense of excitement that comes over me when,\nlooking out at a new world for the first time, I see a man-like animal.\n\nWalking upright!\n\nWearing adornments in the nature of clothing!\n\nI gazed, and my lungs filled with the breath of wonderment. A man!\nAcross millions of miles of space--a man, like the men of the Earth.\n\nSix times before in my life of exploration I had gazed at new realms\nwithin the approachable parts of our universe, but never before had the\nliving creatures borne such wonderful resemblance to the human life of\nour Earth.\n\nA man!\n\nHe might have been creeping on all fours.\n\nHe might have been skulking like a lesser animal.\n\nHe might have been entirely naked.\n\nHe was none of these--and at the very first moment of viewing him I\nfelt a kinship toward him. Oh, he was primitive in appearance--but had\nmy ancestors not been the same? Was this not a mirror of my own race\na million years or so ago? I sensed that my own stream of life had\nsomehow crossed with his in ages gone by. How? Who can ever know? By\nwhat faded charts of the movements through the sky will man ever be\nable to retrace relationships of forms of life among planets?\n\n\"Get ready to go out and meet him, Campbell,\" I said. \"He's a friend.\"\n\nSplit Campbell gave me a look as if to say, Sir, you don't even know\nwhat sort of animal he is, actually, much less whether he's friendly or\nmurderous.\n\n\"There are some things I can sense on first sight, Campbell. Take my\nword for it, he's a friend.\"\n\n\"I didn't say anything, sir.\"\n\n\"Good. Don't. Just get ready.\"\n\n\"We're going to go _out_--?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said. \"Orders.\"\n\n\"And meet both of them?\" Split was at the telescope.\n\n\"Both?\" I took the instrument from him. Both! \"Well!\"\n\n\"They seem to be coming out of the ground,\" Split said. \"I see no signs\nof habitation, but apparently we've landed on top of an underground\ncity--though I hasten to add that this is only an hypothesis.\"\n\n\"One's a male and the other's a female,\" I said.\n\n\"Another hypothesis,\" said Split.\n\nThe late evening sunshine gave us a clear view of our two \"friends\".\nThey were fully a mile away. Split was certain they had not seen our\nship, and to this conclusion I was in agreement. They had apparently\ncome up out of the barren rock hillside to view the sunset. I studied\nthem through the telescope while Split checked over equipment for a\nhike.\n\nThe man's walk was unhurried. He moved thoughtfully, one might\nguess. His bare chest and legs showed him to be statuesque in mold,\ncleanly muscled, fine of bone. His skin was almost the color of the\ncream-colored robe which flowed from his back, whipping lightly in\nthe breeze. He wore a brilliant red sash about his middle, and this\nwas matched by a red headdress that came down over his shoulders as a\ncircular mantle.\n\nThe girl stood several yards distant, watching him. This was some\nsort of ritual, no doubt. He was not concerned with her, but with the\nsetting sun. Its rays were almost horizontal, knifing through a break\nin the distant mountain skyline. He went through some routine motions,\nhis moving arms highlighted by the lemon-colored light of evening.\n\nThe girl approached him. Two other persons appeared from somewhere back\nof her.... Three.... Four.... Five....\n\n\"Where do they come from?\" Split had paused in the act of checking\nequipment to take his turn at the telescope. If he had not done so, I\nmight not have made a discovery. The landscape was _moving_.\n\nThe long shadows that I had not noticed through the telescope were a\nprominent part of the picture I saw through the ship's window when I\nlooked out across the scene with the naked eye. The shadows were moving.\n\nThey were tree shadows. They were moving toward the clearing where the\ncrowd gathered. And the reason for their movement was that the trees\nthemselves were moving.\n\n\"Notice anything?\" I asked Split.\n\n\"The crowd is growing. We've certainly landed on top of a city.\" He\ngazed. \"They're coming from underground.\"\n\nLooking through the telescope, obviously he didn't catch the view of\nthe moving trees.\n\n\"Notice anything else unusual?\" I persisted.\n\n\"Yes. The females--I'm speaking hypothetically--but they _must_ be\nfemales--are all wearing puffy white fur ornaments around their elbows.\nI wonder why?\"\n\n\"You haven't noticed the trees?\"\n\n\"The females are quite attractive,\" said Split.\n\nI forgot about the moving trees, then, and took over the telescope.\nMobile trees were not new to me. I had seen similar vegetation on other\nplanets--\"sponge-trees\"--which possessed a sort of muscular quality. If\nthese were similar, they were no doubt feeding along the surface of the\nslope below the rocky plateau. The people in the clearing beyond paid\nno attention to them.\n\nI studied the crowd of people. Only the leader wore the brilliant garb.\nThe others were more scantily clothed. All were handsome of build. The\nlemon-tinted sunlight glanced off the muscular shoulders of the males\nand the soft curves of the females.\n\n\"Those furry elbow ornaments on the females,\" I said to Split,\n\"they're for protection. The caves they live in must be narrow, so\nthey pad their elbows.\"\n\n\"Why don't they pad their shoulders? They don't have anything on their\nshoulders.\"\n\n\"Are you complaining?\"\n\nWe became fascinated in watching, from the seclusion of our ship. If we\nwere to walk out, or make any sounds, we might have interrupted their\nmeeting. Here they were in their native ritual of sunset, not knowing\nthat people from another world watched. The tall leader must be making\na speech. They sat around him in little huddles. He moved his arms in\ncalm, graceful gestures.\n\n\"They'd better break it up!\" Split said suddenly. \"The jungles are\nmoving in on them.\"\n\n\"They're spellbound,\" I said. \"They're used to sponge-trees. Didn't you\never see moving trees?\"\n\nSplit said sharply, \"Those trees are marching! They're an army under\ncover. Look!\"\n\nI saw, then. The whole line of advancing vegetation was camouflage for\na sneak attack. And all those natives sitting around in meeting were as\ninnocent as a flock of sitting ducks. Split Campbell's voice was edged\nwith alarm. \"Captain! Those worshippers--how can we warn them? Oh-oh!\nToo late. Look!\"\n\nAll at once the advancing sponge-trees were tossed back over the heads\nof the savage band concealed within. They were warriors--fifty or more\nof them--with painted naked bodies. They dashed forward in a wide\nsemicircle, swinging crude weapons, bent on slaughter.\n\n\n3.\n\nThey were waving short clubs or whips with stones tied to the ends.\nThey charged up the slope, about sixty yards, swinging their weird\nclubs with a threat of death.\n\nWild disorder suddenly struck the audience. Campbell and I believed we\nwere about to witness a massacre.\n\n\"Captain--_Jim_! You're not going to let this happen!\"\n\nOur sympathies had gone to the first groups, the peaceable ones. I had\nthe same impulse as Campbell--to do something--anything! Yet here we\nsat in our ship, more than half a mile from our thirty-five or forty\n\"friends\" in danger.\n\nOur friends were panicked. But they didn't take flight. They didn't\nduck for the holes in the rocky hilltop. Instead, they rallied and\npacked themselves around their tall leader. They stood, a defiant wall.\n\n\"Can we shoot a ray, Jim?\"\n\nI didn't answer. Later I would recall that Split _could_ drop his\ndignity under excitement--his \"Captain Linden\" and \"sir.\" Just now he\nwanted any sort of split-second order.\n\nWe saw the naked warriors run out in a wide circle. They spun and\nweaved, they twirled their deadly clubs, they danced grotesquely. They\nwere closing in. Closer and closer. It was all their party.\n\n\"Jim, can we shoot?\"\n\n\"Hit number sixteen, Campbell.\"\n\nSplit touched the number sixteen signal.\n\nThe ship's siren wailed out over the land.\n\nYou could tell when the sound struck them. The circle of savage ones\nsuddenly fell apart. The dancing broke into the wildest contortions you\never saw. As if they'd been spanked by a wave of electricity. The siren\nscream must have sounded like an animal cry from an unknown world. The\nattackers ran for the sponge-trees. The rootless jungle came to life.\nIt jerked and jumped spasmodically down the slope. And our siren kept\nright on singing.\n\n\"Ready for that hike, Campbell? Give me my equipment coat.\" I got\ninto it. I looked back to the telescope. The tall man of the party\nhad behaved with exceptional calmness. He had turned to stare in our\ndirection from the instant the siren sounded. He could no doubt make\nout the lines of our silvery ship in the shadows. Slowly, deliberately,\nhe marched over the hilltop toward us.\n\nMost of his party now scampered back to the safety of their hiding\nplaces in the ground. But a few--the brave ones, perhaps, or the\nofficials of his group--came with him.\n\n\"He needs a stronger guard than that,\" Campbell grumbled.\n\nSixteen was still wailing. \"Set it for ten minutes and come on,\" I\nsaid. Together we descended from the ship.\n\nWe took into our nostrils the tangy air, breathing fiercely, at first.\nWe slogged along over the rock surface feeling our weight to be\none-and-a-third times normal. We glanced down the slope apprehensively.\nWe didn't want any footraces. The trees, however, were still\nretreating. Our siren would sing on for another eight minutes. And\nin case of further danger, we were equipped with the standard pocket\narsenal of special purpose capsule bombs.\n\nSoon we came face to face with the tall, stately old leader in the\ncream-and-red cloak.\n\nSplit and I stood together, close enough to exchange comments against\nthe siren's wail. Fine looking people, we observed. Smooth faces.\nLike the features of Earth men. These creatures could walk down\nany main street back home. With a bit of makeup they would pass.\n\"Notice, Captain, they have strange looking eyes.\" \"Very smooth.\"\n\"It's because they have no eyebrows ... no eye lashes.\" \"Very\nsmooth--handsome--attractive.\"\n\nThen the siren went off.\n\nThe leader stood before me, apparently unafraid. He seemed to be\nwaiting for me to explain my presence. His group of twelve gathered in\nclose.\n\nI had met such situations with ease before. \"EGGWE\" explorers come\nequipped. I held out a gift toward the leader. It was a singing\nmedallion attached to a chain. It was disc-shaped, patterned after a\nlarge silver coin. It made music at the touch of a button. In clear,\ndainty bell tones it rang out its one tune, \"Trail of Stars.\"\n\nAs it played I held it up for inspection. I placed it around my own\nneck, then offered it to the leader. I thought he was smiling. He was\nnot overwhelmed by the \"magic\" of this gadget. He saw it for what it\nwas, a token of friendship. There was a keenness about him that I\nliked. Yes, he was smiling. He bent his head forward and allowed me to\nplace the gift around his neck.\n\n\"Tomboldo,\" he said, pointing to himself.\n\nSplit and I tried to imitate his breathy accents as we repeated aloud,\n\"Tomboldo.\"\n\nWe pointed to ourselves, in turn, and spoke our own names. And then,\nas the names of the others were pronounced, we tried to memorize each\nbreathy sound that was uttered. I was able to remember four or five of\nthem. One was Gravgak.\n\nGravgak's piercing eyes caused me to notice him. Suspicious eyes? I did\nnot know these people's expressions well enough to be sure.\n\nGravgak was a guard, tall and muscular, whose arms and legs were\npainted with green and black diamond designs.\n\nBy motions and words we didn't understand, we inferred that we were\ninvited to accompany the party back home, inside the hill, where we\nwould be safe. I nodded to Campbell. \"It's our chance to be guests of\nTomboldo.\" Nothing could have pleased us more. For our big purpose--to\nunderstand the Serpent River--would be forwarded greatly if we could\nlearn, through the people, what its meanings were. To analyze the\nriver's substance, estimate its rate, its weight, its temperature, and\nto map its course--these facts were only a part of the information we\nsought. The fuller story would be to learn how the inhabitants of this\nplanet regarded it: whether they loved or shunned it, and what legends\nthey may have woven around it. All this knowledge would be useful when\nfuture expeditions of men from the Earth followed us (through EGGWE)\nfor an extension of peaceful trade relationships.\n\nTomboldo depended upon the guard Gravgak to make sure that the way was\nsafe. Gravgak was supposed to keep an eye on the line of floating trees\nthat had taken flight down the hillside. Danger still lurked there, we\nknew. And now the siren that had frightened off the attack was silent.\nOur ship, locked against invaders, could be forgotten. We were guests\nof Tomboldo.\n\nGravgak was our guard, but he didn't work at it. He was too anxious to\nhear all the talk. In the excitement of our meeting, everyone ignored\nthe growing darkness, the lurking dangers. Gravgak confronted us with\nagitated jabbering:\n\n\"Wollo--yeeta--vo--vandartch--vandartch! Grr--see--o--see--o--see--o!\"\n\n\"See--o--see--o--see--o,\" one of the others echoed.\n\nIt began to make sense. They wanted us to repeat the siren noises. The\nenemy had threatened their lives. There could very well have been a\nwholesale slaughter. But as long as we could make the \"see--o--see--o\"\nwe were all safe.\n\nSplit and I exchanged glances. He touched his hand to the equipment\njacket, to remind me we were armed with something more miraculous than\na yowling siren.\n\n\"See--o--see--o--see--o!\" Others of Tomboldo's party echoed the demand.\nThey must have seen the sponge-trees again moving toward our path.\n\"_See--o--see--o!_\"\n\nOur peaceful march turned into a spasm of terror. The sponge-trees\ncame rushing up the slope, as if borne by a sudden gust of wind. They\nbounced over our path, and the war party spilled out of them.\n\nShouting. A wild swinging of clubs. And no cat-and-mouse tricks. No\ndeliberate circling and closing in. An outright attack. Naked bodies\ngleaming in the semi-darkness. Arms swinging weapons, choosing the\nnearest victims. The luminous rocks on the ends of the clubs flashed.\nShouting, screeching, hurling their clubs. The whizzing fury filled the\nair.\n\nI hurled a capsule bomb. It struck at the base of a bouncing\nsponge-tree, and blew the thing to bits.\n\nThe attackers ran back into a huddle, screaming. Then they came\nforward, rushing defiantly.\n\nOur muscular guard, Gravgak was too bold. He had picked up one of their\nclubs and he ran toward their advance, and to all of Tomboldo's party\nit must have appeared that he was bravely rushing to his death. Yet\nthe gesture of the club he swung so wildly could have been intended as\na _warning_! It could have meant, Run back, you fools, or these\nstrange devils will throw fire at you.\n\nI threw fire. And so did my lieutenant. He didn't wait for orders,\nthank goodness. He knew it was their lives or ours. Zip, zip,\nzip--BLANG-BLANG-BLANG! The bursts of fire at their feet ripped the\nrocks. The spray caught them and knocked them back. Three or four\nwarriors in the fore ranks were torn up in the blasts. Others were\nflattened--and those who were able, ran.\n\nThey ran, not waiting for the cover of sponge-trees. Not bothering to\npick up their clubs.\n\nBut the operation was not a complete success. We had suffered a serious\ncasualty. The guard Gravgak. He had rushed out too far, and the first\nblast of fire and rock had knocked him down. Now Tomboldo and others of\nthe party hovered over him.\n\nHis eyes opened a little. I thought he was staring at me, drilling me\nwith suspicion. I worked over him with medicines. The crowd around us\nstood back in an attitude of awe as Split and I applied ready bandages,\nand held a stimulant to his nostrils that made him breath back to\nconsciousness.\n\nSuddenly he came to life. Lying there on his back, with the club still\nat his fingertips, he swung up on one elbow. The swift motion caused\na cry of joy from the crowd. I heard a little of it--and then blacked\nout. For as the muscular Gravgak moved, his fingers closed over the\nhandle of the club. It whizzed upward with him--apparently all by\naccident. The stone that dangled from the end of the club crashed into\nmy head.\n\nI went into instant darkness. Darkness, and a long, long silence.\n\n\n4.\n\nVauna, the beautiful daughter of Tomboldo, came into my life during the\nweeks that I lay unconscious.\n\nI must have talked aloud much during those feverish hours of darkness.\n\n\"Campbell!\" I would call out of a nightmare. \"Campbell, we're about to\nland. Is everything set? Check the instruments again, Campbell.\"\n\n\"S-s-sh!\" The low hush of Split Campbell's voice would somehow\npenetrate my dream.\n\nThe voices about me were soft. My dreams echoed the soft female voices\nof this new, strange language.\n\n\"Campbell, are you there?... Have you forgotten the Code, Campbell?\"\n\n\"Quiet, Captain.\"\n\n\"Who is it that's swabbing my face? I can't see.\"\n\n\"It's Vauna. She's smiling at you, Captain. Can't you see her?\"\n\n\"Is this the pretty one we saw through the telescope?\"\n\n\"One of them.\"\n\n\"And what of the other? There were two together. I remember--\"\n\n\"Omosla is here too. She's Vauna's attendant. We're all looking after\nyou, Captain Linden. Did you know I performed an operation to relieve\nthe pressure on your brain? You must get well, Captain.\" The words of\nCampbell came through insistently.\n\nAfter a silence that may have lasted for hours or days, I said,\n\"Campbell, you haven't forgot the EGGWE Code?\"\n\n\"Of course not, Captain.\"\n\n\"Section Four?\"\n\n\"Section Four,\" he repeated in a low voice, as if to pacify me and put\nme to sleep. \"Conduct of EGGWE agents toward native inhabitants: A, No\nagent shall enter into any diplomatic agreement that shall be construed\nas binding--\"\n\nI interrupted. \"Clause D?\"\n\nHe picked it up. \"D, no agent shall enter into a marriage contract with\nany native.... H-m-m. You're not trying to warn me, are you, Captain\nLinden? Or are you warning _yourself_?\"\n\nAt that moment my eyes opened a little. Swimming before my blurred\nvision was the face of Vauna. I did remember her--yes, she must have\nhaunted my dreams, for now my eyes burned in an effort to define her\nfeatures more clearly. This was indeed Vauna, who had been one of the\nparty of twelve, and had walked beside her father in the face of the\nattack. Deep within my subconscious the image of her beautiful face and\nfigure had lingered. I murmured a single word of answer to Campbell's\nquestion. \"Myself.\"\n\nIn the hours that followed, I came to know the soft footsteps of Vauna.\nThe caverns in which she and her father and all these Benzendella\npeople lived were pleasantly warm and fragrant. My misty impressions of\ntheir life about me were like the first impressions of a child learning\nabout the world into which he has been born.\n\nSometimes I would hear Vauna and her attendant Omosla talking together.\nOften when Campbell would stop in this part of the cavern to inquire\nabout me, Omosla would drop in also. She and Campbell were learning to\nconverse in simple words. And Vauna and I--yes. If I could only avoid\nblacking out.\n\nI wanted to see her.\n\nSo often my eyes would refuse to open. A thousand nightmares. Space\nships shooting through meteor swarms. Stars like eyes. Eyes like stars.\nThe eyes of Vauna, the daughter of Tomboldo. The sensitive stroke of\nVauna's fingers, brushing my forehead, pressing my hand.\n\nI regained my health gradually.\n\n\"Are you quite awake?\" Vauna would ask me in her musical Benzendella\nwords. \"You speak better today. Your friend Campbell has brought you\nmore recordings of our language, so you can learn to speak more. My\nfather is eager to talk with you. But you must sleep more. You are\nstill weak.\"\n\nIt gave me a weird sensation to awaken in the night, trying to adjust\nmyself to my surroundings. The Benzendellas were sleep-singers. By\nnight they murmured mysterious little songs through their sleep.\nStrange harmonies whispered through the caves.\n\nAnd if I stirred restlessly, the footsteps of Vauna might come to me\nthrough the darkness. In her sleeping garments she would come to me,\nfaintly visible in the pink light that filtered through from some\ncorridor. She would whisper melodious Benzendella words and tell me to\ngo back to sleep, and I would drift into the darkness of my endless\ndreams.\n\nThe day came when I awakened to see both Vauna and her father standing\nbefore me. Stern old Tomboldo, with his chalk-smooth face and not a\nhint of an eyebrow or eyelash, rapped his hand against my ribs, shook\nthe fiber bed lightly, and smiled. From a pocket concealed in his\nflowing cape, he drew forth the musical watch, touched the button, and\nplayed, \"Trail of Stars.\"\n\n\"I have learned to talk,\" I said.\n\n\"You have had a long sleep.\"\n\n\"I am well again. See, I can almost walk.\" But as I started to rise,\nthe wave of blackness warned me, and I restrained my ambition. \"I will\nwalk soon.\"\n\n\"We will have much to talk about. Your friend has pointed to the stars\nand told me a strange story of your coming. We have walked around the\nship. He has told me how it rides through the sky. I can hardly make\nmyself believe.\" Tomboldo's eyes cast upward under the strong ridge of\nforehead where the eyebrows should have been. He was evidently trying\nto visualize the flight of a space ship. \"We will have much to tell\neach other.\"\n\n\"I hope so,\" I said. \"Campbell and I came to learn about the _serpent\nriver_.\" I resorted to my own language for the last two words, not\nknowing the Benzendella equivalent. _I_ made an eel-like motion\nwith my arm. But they didn't understand. And before I could explain,\nthe footsteps of other Benzendellas approached, and presently I looked\naround to see that quite an audience had gathered. The most prominent\nfigure of the new group was the big muscular guard of the black and\ngreen diamond markings--Gravgak.\n\n\"You get well?\" Gravgak said to me. His eyes drilled me closely.\n\n\"I get well,\" I said.\n\n\"The blow on the head,\" he said, \"was not meant.\"\n\nI looked at him. Everyone was looking at him, and I knew this was meant\nto be an occasion of apology. But the light of fire in Vauna's eyes\ntold me that she did not believe. He saw her look, and his own eyes\nflashed darts of defiance. With an abrupt word to me, he wheeled and\nstarted off. \"Get well!\"\n\nThe crowd of men and women made way for him. But in the arched doorway\nhe turned. \"Vauna. I am ready to speak to you alone.\"\n\nShe started. I reached and barely touched her hand. She stopped. \"I\nwill talk with you later, Gravgak.\"\n\n\"Now!\" he shouted. \"Alone.\"\n\nHe stalked off. A moment later Vauna, after exchanging a word with her\nfather, excused herself from the crowd and followed Gravgak.\n\nFrom the way those in the room looked, I knew this must be a dramatic\nmoment. It was as if she had acknowledged Gravgak as her master--or her\nlover. He had called for her. She had followed.\n\nBut her old father was still the master. He stepped toward the door.\n\"Vauna!... Gravgak!... Come back.\"\n\n(I will always wonder what might have happened if he hadn't called\nthem! Was my distrust of Gravgak justified? Had I become merely a\njealous lover--or was I right in my hunch that the tall muscular guard\nwas a potential traitor?)\n\nVauna reappeared at once. I believe she was glad that she had been\ncalled back.\n\nGravgak came sullenly. At the edge of the crowd in the arched doorway\nhe stood scowling.\n\n\"While we are together,\" old Tomboldo said quietly, looking around at\nthe assemblage, \"I must tell you the decision of the council. Soon we\nwill move back to the other part of the world.\"\n\nThere were low murmurs of approval through the chamber.\n\n\"We will wait a few days,\" Tomboldo went on, \"until our new friend--\"\nhe pointed to me--\"is well enough to travel. We would never leave him\nhere to the mercy of the savage ones. He and his helper came through\nthe sky in time to save us from being destroyed. We must never forget\nthis kindness. When we ascend the _Kao-Wagwattl_, the ever moving\n_rope of life_, these friends shall come with us. On the back of\nthe Kao-Wagwattl _they shall ride with us across the land_.\"\n\n\n5.\n\nFrom that moment on, there was more buzzing around the caverns than\na hive of bees. It was like a spaceport before the blastoff of a big\ninterplanetary liner. The excitement was enough to cause a sick man to\nhave a relapse--or get well in a hurry to join in on the commotion. I\ndid my best to get well quick!\n\n\"Where is Campbell? Bring me my friend Campbell, please.\"\n\nOmosla, the pretty attendant and companion of Vauna, was always glad, I\nnoticed, to be sent on an errand to Split Campbell, wherever he was.\n\nFrom all reports he was reinforcing the defenses at one point or\nanother where these caverns led up to the surface. They told me he was\na busy man. The attacks of the savage ones had grown more vicious.\nThey had evidently learned that the Benzendellas intended to move back\nto other lands; so they had grown bold in their raids, attempting to\nsteal not only the Benzendellas' treasurers but also their women. They\nhad not been successful. My good lieutenant, navigator and scientist,\nequipped with capsule explosives, had blown one group of them into a\nfountain of dismembered arms and legs. I could just picture him hurling\nthose miniature bombs at the split-second when they would create the\nmost panic.\n\nThe Benzendellas had been quick to recognize a good thing. They only\nwished he were quadruplets or better, to stand guard continuously at\nmany entrances. They brought him their rare foods, and furnished him\nwith a comfortable couch; they offered him gifts. In short, they loved\nhim for his efficiency, and for himself. Especially (according to the\nrumors that reached my ears) Omosla.\n\nPretty little Omosla, I fear, loved him with a love that might have\noverwhelmed a lesser man. But I knew that Split Campbell would not\nbe swerved. He was devoted to duty, dignity, and the Code. The Code\nforbade intermarriage with the natives.\n\nWhy did I keep thinking of the Code? It shouldn't have crossed my\nthoughts so often. I hardly dared stop to ask myself what continually\nbrought it to mind. But I knew. The flare of jealously I had felt when\nGravgak had tried to call Vauna away from the crowd....\n\n\"You are feeling better, Captain?\" Vauna said to me as she watched me\npace the floor. \"You find that you can walk, so you keep walking?\"\n\n\"I need to walk so I can think.\"\n\n\"If you wish to think, you should sit out on the hillside at the time\nof sunset. You understand my words?\"\n\n\"I understand,\" I smiled. Then, rashly, I added, \"I understand your\nwords. I don't always understand you.\"\n\n\"And you wish to understand me?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nI could think of more answers than my vocabulary could handle. I said\nsimply, \"When I go back to my own world I should be able to say that I\nunderstand the people of this world.\"\n\n\"But you _do_ understand us. You see how we live. You hear how we\ntalk. There.\" She pressed my hand. \"That is all you need to understand,\nisn't it? I am the one who does not understand you.\"\n\n\"How do you mean?\"\n\n\"I do not see how you live. I do not hear how you talk.\" She gave a\nlittle laugh. \"Only see how you walk when you think, but I do not know\nwhat you think.\"\n\n\"I think about you,\" I said.\n\n\"That is very nice. I think about you, too, Jim. Since the night you\nsaved us from the savage ones, I have thought about you.\"\n\nI stopped walking in circles and looked at her. The soft light from the\nluminous rock walls gave an ivory tint to her bare shoulders. She wore\na dress of soft woven material, designed with a diagonal line of little\nhand-painted sponge-trees. From the curve of her breasts to the lithe\ngracefulness of her thighs, the close-fitting garment accentuated her\nbeauty.\n\nShe was backing away from me, smiling as if wondering if I would follow\nher. Her arms were bare except for the ornaments of fur around her\nelbows. These were evidently an insignia of Benzendella womanhood, for\nno woman of this realm was to be seen without them.\n\n\"Come,\" Vauna said, beckoning me. \"Put your ear against the wall. What\ndo you hear?\"\n\nShe pressed her head against the wall and I did the same. Finally I\nmade out the faint vibrations of some distant rumbling. I asked, \"What\nis it?\"\n\n\"Kao-Wagwattl.\"\n\n\"The round river that moves like a serpent?\"\n\n\"It is an endless rope,\" she said. \"It is life.\"\n\n\"Life?\"\n\n\"It gathers water and food within itself. It gives life to those who\nseek life. It gives life--\"\n\nShe stopped, and her pretty poetic expression vanished. My hands\ntouched her hands, my fingers moved gently along her wrists, her\nforearms--then as my touch neared her fur-covered elbows, a look of\nshock came into her eyes. \"Jim!\"\n\n\"Yes, Vauna?\"\n\n\"I was trying to tell you--\"\n\n\"_What?_\"\n\nFor a moment she only looked at me, searching my eyes. \"We _don't_\nunderstand each other, do we?\"\n\nFinally I said, \"Then why don't we ask each other questions?\"\n\n\"Yes.... Yes, ask me questions.\"\n\n\"All right.\" I had an impulse to start pacing again. I walked about for\na moment. \"Tell me, Vauna. When your friend Gravgak demanded that you\ncome and talk with him alone, what would have happened if your father\nhadn't called you back?\"\n\nShe smiled faintly. \"I will tell you a secret, Jim. I had already made\nmy father promise to call me back. I whispered to him, 'Call me back.'\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nShe gave an evasive little laugh. \"You understand enough already. Now\nit is my question. Tell me, Captain Jim, why do you keep saying that\nyou are going back to another world?\"\n\n\"Because I am. That's my duty.\"\n\n\"When you ride with us on the Kao-Wagwattl you will come with us to\nanother part of this world. It is more beautiful than here. We are only\na few. Our race lives in the other part. My father came here only to\nstudy, but soon the Kao-Wagwattl will take us all back. And you and\nyour friend Campbell will go with us and belong to us.\"\n\nThe self-discipline of an EGGWE agent is supposed to be his defense\nagainst any natives' invitations, no matter how beautiful or charming\nthe native. All I could say was, \"You don't understand us, do you,\nVauna?\"\n\n\"Don't I?\"\n\n\"Your people I love. And you, Vauna. But our orders are to return. I\nmust not think of disobeying my orders. And I assure you Campbell is\none who would never disobey.\"\n\n\"The big silver shell will take you away from us?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You will remember me?\"\n\n\"Yes, always.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Jim.\" She was weeping. I started to take her in my arms,\nbut thought better of it. She dried her eyes. \"I will remember you too.\nWhen I see Campbell and Omosla, I will have a dream of this hour, and\nhow we didn't understand.\"\n\nI was quick to make a correction. \"You'll not be seeing Campbell. I'll\nhave to take him back with me, you know.\"\n\n\"No, he will be here. It is our rule that he should stay.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because he has become the mate of our girl, Omosla.\"\n\nI looked at her, not believing I had heard her words correctly. A\nfever swept my brain. In my own language I said harshly, \"It's a lie!\nCampbell would never violate--\"\n\n\"I do not understand your words,\" Vauna said softly.\n\nThen in my broken Benzendella accents I asserted, calmly but\ndecisively, \"I don't believe what you say. I don't believe that\nCampbell has become the mate of Omosla.\"\n\n\"You will believe,\" Vauna said, \"when Omosla's baby is born.\"\n\n\n6.\n\nI had already sent for Campbell. Mentally I chastized myself for having\nsent Omosla. For if what I had been told was true, his life had become\ncomplicated enough already. (I must admit that for the moment I had\nsomething less than proper consideration for _her_.)\n\nOmosla didn't return from the errand for Campbell. Maybe the news of\nmy concern for him had frightened her away. One of her friends told me\nthat Campbell was out on the surface somewhere; that he couldn't be\nlocated just now. When he returned they would send him to _me_.\n\nI then sought the counsel of Tomboldo.\n\n\"It can't be true, this story about Campbell,\" I said. \"There's been\nsome mistake.\"\n\nTomboldo's answer was soft spoken. \"Much has happened. You have been\nill for many weeks. You must take our word. Do you find the news not to\nyour liking? Omosla is a devoted girl. And if our hero Campbell became\nher husband, all of us would be proud.\"\n\nThere was no use talking of the EGGWE Code to him, that was plain. All\nI could say at the moment was, \"I'll talk with Campbell.\"\n\nFor the next few nights, after the whole cavern city seemed to be\nasleep, I would walk forth a little distance. This was more than\npacing. It was a test of my strength and my wits, and most of all my\nconfidence that I would not black out. It was proof to myself that I\nwas a well man again. It was a willful act of striking out on my own\npurposes. I would find Campbell.\n\nEach night I ventured a little farther. The artificial lights burned\nlow. All was quiet. The luminous rock walls stared out from among\nthe cavern furnishings. I walked steadily. I was getting used to the\nplanet's stronger gravity. I was learning to like the sandals they had\ngiven me to wear, cushioned with shreds of sponge-tree vegetation.\n\nTonight as always I walked to the right from the arch, through one\nof Tomboldo's rooms, and on past the storage rooms. The way opened\ninto a long amber-lighted tunnel. The city branched off in little\ntunneled avenues from this passageway. Would Campbell be found on guard\ntonight--this way--or this way--or--\n\nI heard light footsteps, sounds of two persons somewhere in the\ndistance. I moved back toward Tomboldo's part of the cave to wait until\nthe ways had cleared.\n\nTwo men were coming through the corridor, conversing in low whispers.\n\nI moved back into the shadows, scarcely breathing.\n\nThe glow of amber light from the corridor revealed them, silhouetted.\nThe taller man was driving the smaller one ahead of him, threatening\nhim with a short-bladed knife.\n\nThey slowed their steps. Their low whispers were audible.\n\n\"If you breathe a word I'll rip you.\" The agitated words of the tall\nguard, Gravgak. The light revealed the lines of green-and-black\ndiamonds painted on his thighs.\n\nThe smaller man, also a guard, muttered, \"Have I ever told anything?\"\n\n\"You understand, then,\" said Gravgak. \"If anything happens, you'll\nswear there was an intruder--one of the savages.\"\n\n\"I'll swear it. I'll say that I--\"\n\n\"Say that he knocked you down and forced his way in. Like this!\"\nGravgak struck him with his fist. The guard tumbled in a heap against\nthe cavern wall. He lay there, eyes closed. Gravgak tiptoed past my\nhiding place. His eyes glinted with purpose. He paused at Tomboldo's\ndoor, weighed the knife in his hand, then sheathed it. He went on\ntoward Vauna's room.\n\nI skipped to one side of the storage room where I had seen my equipment\ncoat hanging. Without it I could have been no match for this man.\nMy fingers caught it off the wall, I got into it as I hurried back.\nAutomatically my hands checked the contents, everything in place--\n\nGravgak was conversing with Vauna through the partly opened door. \"I\ntold you I would come.\"\n\n\"You have no right. I told you--\" There was strength, not fear, in\nVauna's low voice.\n\n\"Your father means for me to win you, if necessary by force.\"\n\n\"You lie. Go or I'll sound the alarm.\"\n\n\"You are in love with that stranger.\" His voice trembled with rage.\n\"See, you don't answer. If you want him to live, get rid of him. Send\nhim back in his silver shell.\"\n\n\"You threaten my father's guest?\"\n\n\"The great Tomboldo will not live long. I have heard the savages plan\nto come in some night soon and murder him.\"\n\nAt that instant old Tomboldo's voice sounded from the next room. \"Who's\nthere, Vauna?\"\n\n\"Gravgak!\" It was Gravgak himself who answered. \"I came to protect you,\nTomboldo. There's danger--\"\n\nTomboldo's voice thundered with anger at this unaccountable intrusion.\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"They mean to kill you, and if they do--\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"The savages. And if they succeed, I am your successor. Tell your\ndaughter it's so. Tell her that if a knife blade descends from some\ndark corner--_look out_! Someone behind you!\"\n\nIt was a ruse to cause old Tomboldo to whirl about and turn his back\nto Gravgak. Tomboldo didn't whirl. But he must have seen what I saw,\nglittering in the dim light--the knife in Gravgak's hand. It flashed\nup--\n\nI flung a capsule bomb at the arch. Fire flashed, and the voices were\nswallowed up in the concussion.\n\n\n7.\n\nThe swirl of yellow dust sifted through the cavern passages. Coughing\nand puffing hard, I fought my way into the heap--in time to catch sight\nof Gravgak staggering off toward an exit tunnel.\n\nThe three of us stood together. A strange trio. Two Benzendellas, one\nEarth man. Bound together in an allegiance that all the space in the\nuniverse could never divide. Vauna was weeping softly, holding her arms\ntight about herself, her hands cupped over the fur wrappings of her\nelbows.\n\nShe said she could not understand Gravgak's behavior. Once he had had\na chance to become the leader. Was it all because he was insane with\njealousy--because she loved me?\n\nHer father thought it was more than this. He had evidently read signs\nof disloyalty in Gravgak, even before my coming. Too many plans had\nfiltered out to the savage enemies. For a long time Gravgak had been\nimpatient for a chance to succeed Tomboldo; my coming had thwarted the\noriginal plan--the murderous attack on the sunset meeting. Yes, Gravgak\nhad been twisting the sponge-tree bands into his own schemes even then.\n\nThe fine boldness showed in Tomboldo's eyes as he talked. People had\ngathered, and they saw clearly the truth of his charges.\n\nBut now there were delays in getting ready to go to the better land on\nanother side of this planet. Part of the delay was caution. Gravgak\nwould probably lie in waiting for the Benzendella migration to the\nserpent river. He would plan an attack. Some waiting, some scouting and\nmuch preparation would be a matter of wisdom. Meanwhile, if Gravgak\ncould be found, let him be killed on sight.\n\nSeveral weeks passed. Secret preparations for the twenty mile migration\nwere completed. I was pleased to hear that Campbell had had a share in\nthese plans. He had made several night hikes back to the ship, and had\nkept watch through the telescope by day, and made valuable observations\nby means of infra-red photography by night. He knew where the nests of\nthe savage bands were located. Moreover, I learned that he and a few\nof Tomboldo's choice scouts, under cover of darkness, crossed through\nthe sponge-tree area to examine the Serpent River at close range and\ndetermine upon a suitable place for getting the Benzendella tribe\naboard.\n\nFor these observations, and for an abundance of scientific data which\nhe picked up about the Serpent River itself, I was deeply grateful. If\nthis expedition succeeded in its purposes, the success would be to his\ncredit, not mine.\n\nNevertheless, when I was at last conducted to his quarters at the end\nof one of the tunnels--my long awaited visit--I did not spend all my\ntime complimenting him for his fine achievements.\n\n\"You're going to be ready to make the trip with the tribe, I presume?\"\nI asked, when we got around to the plans for the migration.\n\n\"And leave the ship here? I shall follow orders, Captain, but I should\nprefer to stay with the ship, and to proceed with the remainder of the\nscientific assignments.\"\n\nHe handed his field glasses over to one of the relief guards, and led\nme to a bench in his primitive quarters. A slice of sunlight knifed\nthrough from the out-of-doors, the first I had seen for a long time.\n\n\"A little sunlight's not a bad thing,\" I said casually. \"I've been\nneeding a little light.\"\n\nHe looked up at me as if he knew what was coming. \"If you've been\nhearing a rumor, don't believe it.\"\n\n\"You've heard it too?\"\n\n\"They say I'm supposed to become the husband of Omosla.\"\n\n\"All I want is your word, Lieutenant Campbell,\" I said.\n\n\"My word. Captain.\" Split said dryly. \"You know I wouldn't break the\nCode.\"\n\n\"I believe you.... Okay, we're in a spot. The fact is, the girl's going\nto have a baby. When she does, she'll declare you her mate. And the\ntribe will be proud. Have you thought this through?\"\n\n\"I've tried to.\"\n\nI began to pace. \"You know we can't afford to offend the tribe. If you\nbluntly deny that you've had anything to do with the girl, they'll be\ninsulted. They're ready to believe her, not you.\"\n\n\"How soon will the child be born?\"\n\n\"Within a few days.\"\n\n\"How long have we been here?\"\n\n\"Long enough.\"\n\n\"Why doesn't her true mate speak up, whoever he is?\"\n\nI said, \"That's one of the strange circumstances. I haven't heard them\nmention any other man but you. You see, Split, you're the hero of the\nhour. You're the one they want.\"\n\n\"I hope you're not suggesting that _I_ marry this girl.\"\n\n\"I _haven't_ suggested it, have _I_? But I will ask this: Do\nyou like the girl?... Love her??... Enough to marry her?\"\n\n\"Under more favorable conditions--yes. I've never loved anybody before.\nBut Omosla--from the first time I saw her, that evening, in the\nsunset--\"\n\n\"All right, Split. But you still tell me you haven't made love to her?\"\n\n\"Absolutely, _no_. You may not know it, Jim, but I was with you\nalmost constantly for days and nights after your knockout. You came\nthrough the operation--the riskiest thing I ever tried in my life. When\nyou began to pull out of it, I could have gladly taken you back to the\nship and blasted off for home. But they were giving you care--Vauna and\nOmosla--and damned intelligent care, according to my orders. By that\ntime the savages were knocking on our doors again, and I went onto the\ndefense job with my pockets full of scare bombs, and the other kind\ntoo. From then on, I couldn't have held to tighter discipline if I'd\nbeen in a planetary war, I swear it.\"\n\nI beat my fist lightly on Split's shoulder. The fellow was great, no\ndoubt about it, and I felt like a fool asking him questions about\nmatters outside the bounds of duty. \"You're okay, Split. You could\nviolate a hundred codes, as far as I'm concerned, and I'd swear before\nany court in the world that you're tops. But we've still got a problem\nwith this tribe--and this girl.\"\n\n\"I'm not asking for compliments,\" Split said. \"For the record I'm\ntelling you what _did_ happen, and what didn't. And here's what\ndid.\" Now it was his turn to pace twice around the bench. \"How do I\nbegin?\"\n\n\"With Omosla.\"\n\n\"Omosla comes to me often. She brings me food and drink. She hangs\naround like a pet. She doesn't touch me--anymore. I put a stop to\nthat soon after the first time she put her arms around me. Yes, she\ndid that. I was busy watching the sponge-trees move down the valley.\nShe was nearby, murmuring words, most of which I could only half\nunderstand. I didn't stop her when she slipped her arms around me--not\nfor quite awhile. I remember plenty well the way those pins in her\nelbow furs scratched my arms. They stuck in like thorns. Look, you can\nstill see the marks.\" He rolled up his sleeves to show me the slight\nscars on his upper arms, just above the elbows. \"I figured either she\ndidn't know those pins were sticking me, or else it was some sort of\ntricky test that girls use on men to test their metal. So I took it,\nand didn't wince. Sure, I was enjoying letting her hug me. But after\nthat one time I always kept my distance. This all happened when we\nfirst came. You'd think she'd have forgotten. Especially if she had a\nreal husband somewhere on the scene.\"\n\nI groaned. \"Every tribe has strange customs. When the baby comes,\nthat's when they'll insist on a husband.\"\n\n\"I wonder who it really is.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately we can't prove anything by giving the baby a blood test.\nThese primitives wouldn't understand.\"\n\n\"Proofs are out,\" Campbell said.\n\n\"However, we still have the eyelash test,\" I suggested.\n\n\"You mean--\"\n\n\"I mean that you and I are the only two human animals on this planet\nwith eyebrows and eyelashes. When Omosla's baby arrives without a trace\nof an eyelash, that might go a long way toward convincing--\"\n\n\"You'll help me fight it, then?\"\n\n\"If you're sure you don't want to change your mind, throw out the Code,\nand claim the girl.\"\n\nA look of disdain was all the answer Campbell gave me, at first.\nFinally he said, \"You'd had ample reasons for nicknaming me Split,\nCaptain. But so far, I've given you no grounds for applying the term to\nmy personality. I prefer to remain a member of EGGWE, in good standing,\nand to return to Earth with a clear record. Let Omosla name the true\nfather, whoever he is.\"\n\n\n8.\n\nThe whole Benzendella tribe made its way across to the Kao-Wagwattl\nwith only one casualty reported. Leeger, the short, slight guard who\nhad once been brutally knocked out by Gravgak, was reported missing.\n\nEveryone else came through without a scratch. It was a triumph for old\nTomboldo. His superhuman courage had carried the day. Children were\ndelighted over the adventure. Old folks were happy over achieving what\nthey had feared would be an impossible undertaking. They could believe,\nnow, that they would live all through to the end of the journey--for\nKao-Wagwattl, the serpent river, was a legendary giver of life.\n\nCampbell did not come. That was according to plan. He kept in touch\nwith me by radio through the final hours of the twenty-mile crossing.\n\"... Do you read me, Captain? I've drawn them to the north with fire\nbombs from the ship's guns.... They've never guessed your course.\"\n\n\"No signs of Gravgak? Or Leeger?\"\n\n\"Not a sign. The city's empty.\"\n\n\"Keep on the radio, Campbell.\"\n\n\"Right, Captain. By the way, how is Omosla?\"\n\n\"Expecting. I'll let you know. She still talks about the bravest man on\nthe planet, someone named Campbell.\"\n\n\"H-m-m. You'll sort of look after her, won't you?\"\n\nIt was two hours before dawn when the last of the tribe (Leeger\nexcepted) gathered at the mountainside station to board Kao-Wagwattl.\nWe waited for daylight. Strange smells filled our nostrils. Smells of\nwood fires, sparked to life by friction under the pressures of the\ncrawling monster. Smells of rocks being ground to powder. Smells of\nthe saccharine-sweet breathing from the pores of the thing itself, the\ngiant Kao-Wagwattl.\n\nThe faint gray of dawn gradually changed to pink. In the growing\nlight we could make out the contour of the vast misty creeping form.\nIts rounded sides moved along only yards from where we stood. As the\nlight of morning came on we could distinguish the immense box-shaped\nscales that covered its sides. Clouds of sponge-trees rose and fell\naround it. Unrooted vegetation would sift downward, to be bumped into\nthe air again, or to be rolled under. Small fires were continually\nbeing ignited by friction, and often smothered before they were well\nstarted. Sometimes the burning would creep up around the curved sides,\nonly to be snuffed out by the surface-breathing of the massive thing.\n\nI was relieved to note that the curved top--the \"spine\", so to\nspeak--was so gradually rounded that there could be no danger of\nanyone's falling off. Its immensity had to be seen to be appreciated.\n\nAs to its length, I took the word of Tomboldo and others. It was\nendless. It wound around the whole planet like a fifty-thousand mile\nserpent that had swallowed its own tail. An unbroken rope of life,\nforever crawling.\n\nA gigantic creature? A gargantuan vine? A living thing! I should\nnot say that it was more animal than plant. When I asked Tomboldo's\ncounsellors, Was it animal or vegetable, their answer was, Yes. Yes,\n_what_? Yes, it was animal or vegetable. They stressed the OR.\nMust it be one and not the other? Evidently the Kao-Wagwattl was not to\nbe compared, not to be classified, but to be accepted--and utilized.\n\nFor this wandering tribe it was a means of escape from enemies, and a\nmode of travel. With the coming of daylight, they went to work.\n\nCrude cranes. Swinging baskets. Hoists. One group after another was\ntossed up into the rubbery purplish-gray scales that covered the\nKao-Wagwattl's spine.\n\nNo one cried out. The landing was soft. And harmless. The speed of\nthe crawl was not great. It must have averaged not more than ten or\nfifteen miles an hour. But there were variations, to be taken advantage\nof. The outsides of a curve moved swiftly. Foresighted Tomboldo had\nselected the inside of a curve for our mounting, where the movement\nwas sluggish. Younger members could leap across from an overhanging\nplatform. Once safely in the folds of the surface, they could climb the\nrounded wall at their leisure.\n\nThree or four hours were required for the entire tribe to get aboard.\nThis meant that a long line was formed. Over a span of many miles this\nheadless, tailless serpent became inhabited with tiny human fleas,\nfiguratively speaking.\n\nAmong the stragglers who boarded last were a few older persons who\nhad to be coaxed and pampered before they would get into the swinging\nbasket.\n\nThen, too, there was Omosla, looking very pretty and thoroughly\nfrightened. She caused a slight delay at the very last by deciding it\nwas time for her to have her baby.\n\n\n9.\n\nFinally we were all aboard, and the mighty Kao-Wagwattl, unaffected by\nthis addition of a few specks of human dust, moved on at its dogged\npace through the mountain valleys.\n\nNo lives had been lost. No one had been seriously injured. Tomboldo was\nthe heroic leader. I went forward over the lumpy slabs of scales, to\nfind him and congratulate him. He said, \"The glad feelings are to be\nshared,\" and he spoke with high praise of my own help and that of my\nfriend Campbell. \"But we are not yet out of danger. Pass the word.\"\n\nPass the word. Keep down. Out of sight. For several days we would be\ncrawling through the lands of savages.\n\nVauna found me. She had made sure that Omosla and the baby would have\nthe best of care, and now she meant to look after me. \"My dear one,\"\nshe called me.\n\n\"Here, my dear one. I have your valuable coat. Come out of sight. The\nenemy must not see you.\"\n\nI glanced up the long curved spine of Kao, moving steadily through the\nsunshine. Little groups of Benzendellas could be seen ahead, as far as\nthe eye could reach. The young children of the party had never had such\na trip before, and the older ones found it a strenuous game to keep\nthem down out of sight. Following Tomboldo's order, they rapidly ducked\ndown into hiding. The great rubber-like scales resembled up-ended\nboxes, set in criss-cross rows. The deep flexible crevices thus formed\nwere ideal for hiding.\n\nI needed my radio. I must talk with Campbell. Vauna had taken my coat.\n\nShe called to me. \"Come, my dear one.\" She slipped down into a crevice\na little to one side of the crest. \"Come, I hear the voice of your\nfriend Campbell in the box.\"\n\n\"I'm coming. Speak to him, Vauna. Tell him to wait.\"\n\n\"Shall I tell him the news?\"\n\nI didn't answer. The vertical surfaces of the scales folded together,\nparted, folded again, with the motions of the great creature, and for\na moment I lost sight of Vauna. But I could hear her voice as I fought\nmy way down to her hiding place. She was talking through the radio with\nCampbell.\n\n\"You are safe on the big silver ship?... Yes, we are on Kao-Wagwattl. I\nhave been looking after Omosla....\"\n\nI could hear the eagerness in Campbell's voice as he asked about\nOmosla. Vauna answered him in accents of joy. \"She has had her\nbaby ... A little girl! Very beautiful. Already she looks like you.\n_She has precious little lines of hair on her eyelids, and above her\neyes, just like yours._\"\n\nThe damage was done! There was no point in my lying to Campbell to\nspare his feelings. Her words were the simple innocent truth. She was\nhappy and proud to tell the wonderful news. Her words implied that\nCampbell would of course come and join us when his work was done, so he\ncould be Omosla's husband, as all the Benzendellas expected.\n\nAbout all I could say to Campbell was, \"What she says is true, Split.\nIt's a beautiful baby. Any father should be proud. I have nothing to\nadd.\"\n\nFor hours afterward I could think of nothing else. I sat hidden among\nthe deep soft scales, listening. Now and then the gentle movement would\ncause the crevices around me to gape open, wide enough to reveal a\nstrip of sky. I wondered if sometime I might catch sight of a space\nship bolting off into the blue. The only sounds I heard were the\nfaint muffled rumblings of the Kao-Wagwattl moving along, like gentle\nthunder echoing up from somewhere down in the earth. It lulled me into\nrelaxation, yet I could not dispel the mental image of Campbell sitting\nthere in the ship, alone, brooding over the news. And tempted, no\ndoubt, to touch the controls and leave this planet behind him.\n\nLater I talked with him again, but we did not mention Omosla. He said\nhe was busy with his scientific findings. I relayed to him descriptions\nof the Kao-Wagwattl--the \"inside\" story, from one who was concealed\nwithin its scales. We were back to our original assignment, now. For\ndays and days to come, we pursued the scientific facts, comparing\nnotes by radio.\n\nAt air-cruise speed, Campbell made trips around the planet, and\ncompleted his charts and maps. He reported that the beautiful land\ntoward which we were moving was indeed a land of promise. But he\ngave slower estimates of the Kao-Wagwattl's speed, and he estimated\nthat it would take us the larger part of a year to reach our\ndestination. However, he managed to get an inside view of the larger\nBenzendella tribes who dwelt there. They were truly waiting for old\nTomboldo's return, and were firm in their faith that the rope of life,\nKao-Wagwattl, would bring him.\n\nSuch were the scientific and ethnological studies that Campbell and I\nwere to share, by radio, in the weeks and months to come....\n\nNow Vauna was beside me. We, like the others, were settled down for the\nlong journey.\n\nInnocent Vauna! She was trying so hard to please me. She sat very\nclose, whispering to me.\n\nI listened, and smiled, and tried to take my thoughts away from the\nimage of Campbell, his honor shattered by her recent words to him about\nthe baby--a baby with eyelashes--a baby that resembled him.\n\nIf I remained silent, Vauna would tease me into talking with her. \"Do\nmy words displease you, Captain?\"\n\n\"Your words please me very much.\"\n\n\"You do not look at me. You only look away. Do you want me to sit close\nbeside you?\"\n\nI drew her in my arms and held her. In silence I thought a thousand\nthoughts that I had brought with me across millions of miles of space.\n\nLater I said to her, \"Your arms are warm. Why don't you take these fur\nthings off your elbows, to be more comfortable?\"\n\nShe smiled, and kissed me as I had taught her to kiss. \"You want me\nto?\" And she removed the furry white elbow ornaments. It was very\nstrange.... While we hovered close, she whispered to me of the secrets\nof life on this planet, unlike any other world I had known. And there\nwere curious legends of Kao-Wagwattl, things she had carried in her\nheart to tell me if such a time as this should ever come.\n\nAs she talked, the pressure of the scale walls around us increased.\nThe great Kao-Wagwattl was evidently moving through a dip, so that its\nupper surfaces were compressed. There was no lack of air for breathing,\nbut the darkness and the pressure added strangeness to the sensation.\nThe tightness of Vauna's arms against my own caused my head to spin.\nPerhaps it was the fever returning from my recent illness. My arms felt\nthe stinging sensation of being penetrated by needles. My thoughts\nflicked back to something Split Campbell had once told me....\n\nLater, when the Kao curved over a summit, and the patches of sunlight\ndashed in, I suggested that Vauna go forward to see about her father.\nShe answered me with a curious smile. I snuggled deeper into the shade\nof the scales and slept. Hours later, when I awakened, she was again\nbeside me.\n\n\n10.\n\nIf Omosla's baby had been a boy, I believe that old Tomboldo would\nhave named it for the highest honor in the Benzendella world. He\nwas searching for a successor. Not among the grown-up warriors and\ncounsellors. Among the infants. He sought a child favored by nature.\nOmosla was a beauty and a court favorite, even though she had been\na servant. And Campbell, who was considered to be her mate, (though\nmarriage had been delayed by circumstances) was of course a renowned\nhero. If the child had only been a boy!\n\nI was kept busy reporting the reasons for Campbell's absence. He had\nstayed with our ship to guarantee Benzendella safety. Yes, it was true\nthat he could fly through the air and catch up with us. But there were\nduties which kept him away.\n\nMy excuses wore thin. Vauna and her father begged me to tell him, over\nthe radio, that Omosla was growing into a person of sorrow. The shadow\nof tragedy hovered over her.\n\nI complied. I talked, by radio, with Campbell. He was in another\npart of the land, now, pursuing the purposes for which we had come.\nMy mention of Omosla's plight aroused his defiance. He said he would\nrather be a deserter than serve a captain who did not accept his word.\n\"For the last time, Captain Linden, I repeat that I am not the mate of\nOmosla. Do you believe me?\"\n\n\"I don't know what to believe,\" I said.\n\nHis radio clicked off.\n\nVauna and her father and I secluded ourselves among the scales and\ntalked. My one question was, Could there have been any other person\namong them who had come from another planet?\n\n\"You and Campbell. No others.\"\n\n\"How can you be sure?\" I pursued. \"Suppose someone from my world\nwished to pass for a native. Suppose he should pluck the hairs from\nhis eyelids and cut away his eyebrows. Would you know him to be an\noutsider?\"\n\n\"Come,\" Vauna said. \"We'll walk from one end of the tribe to the other.\"\n\nWhile the great endless Kao-Wagwattl carried us on, through deep\nvalleys and across wide plains, Vauna and I went about, day by day,\nstudying the looks of each male member of the tribe.\n\nI scrutinized the eyes of each. I listened to the native enunciations.\nI got acquainted with each man by name and personality. Vauna's\nfriendship to all was a help. Through her I began to gain a bond of\naffection for all these people, deep and solid. Their ways became\nnatural to me. In the night their sleep-singing could be heard, welling\nup softly through the scales within which they rested. In the mornings\none could see the parties of agile ones gathering food and liquid\nfruits that rolled within reach along the sides of the moving Kao.\n\nWe crossed a series of islands. For long spaces there would be danger\nof dips under the surfaces of waters. We would close ourselves tightly\nwithin the waterproof interstices until the danger had passed. Later,\nwhen the slimy surfaces of the scales had dried off, we would emerge.\n\nAnd now, out of a chance conversation, I learned of another danger\nwhich had been with us all along. Gravgak was also on the Kao-Wagwattl.\n\n\"How did you know this?\" I asked Vauna sharply.\n\n\"Didn't my father tell you? I received a warning soon after we began\nthe journey.\"\n\n\"Warning--from whom?\"\n\n\"From Leeger.\"\n\n\"Leeger! I thought he was missing.\"\n\n\"He reappeared. He had known of our plan. He had boarded, somewhere. He\nwas back there, beyond the end of our party. He shouted the warning to\nme. That is why you and I moved up the line, and have kept ourselves\nhidden.\"\n\n\"He shouted a warning to you--\"\n\n\"That Gravgak is also on board, looking for me.\"\n\n\n11.\n\nWeeks earlier, a search party had given up. It had all happened\nquietly. Tomboldo had kept a few of his top scouts on the job (as I now\nlearned) and for months after our journey had begun they had scoured\nthe scaly surfaces of Kao-Wagwattl, looking in vain for Gravgak.\n\nCould we rest assured, then, that Gravgak had been bluffed out? That\nhe had given up his purpose of trying to take Vauna? That he had long\nsince climbed off the Kao-Wagwattl and gone back home?\n\nWe hoped so. Nevertheless we moved cautiously as our searches took us\nback through the long line of Benzendellas.\n\nThen, without warning, we suddenly came upon Leeger. He saw us from a\ndistance of fifty yards or less. We had come to the end of our tribe's\nsettlement--evidently beyond the end; for in the last quarter of a mile\nwe had found no persons dwelling among the scales.\n\n\"He motioned to us,\" Vauna said. \"I'm sure it was Leeger.\"\n\nBut Leeger had disappeared from view. Back of us now was the wilderness\nof scales, their curved surface glistening and alive with color as the\nendless crawling spine followed us out of the distant blue haze. Miles\nof Kao-Wagwattl, and nothing showing on the surface.\n\nWe were down, now, almost out of sight, yet peering over. Suddenly the\nform of Leeger bobbed up again, only a few feet from us.\n\n\"Go back!\" Leeger cried, flinging a hand at us. \"Go back! He's coming!\"\n\nIt all happened in less time than it can be told. Leeger rose up to\nwarn us. We saw the knife fly through the air at him. He fell with the\nblade through his throat.\n\nOn the instant we saw the dark muscular form of Gravgak rearing up\namong the scales. The green-and-black diamond-shaped markings on his\narms and legs glinted in the light. He had hurled his knife true.\nTriumph shone in his murderous eyes. He had killed the man who had\nstalked him to protect Vauna and Tomboldo. And now he must have\nbelieved that one of his prizes was within easy reach.\n\nHis arm flashed upward. It held one of those rockstrung clubs that the\nsavages used so skillfully.\n\nThe weighted club whizzed through the air. I swung Vauna off her feet.\nI'll swear the rolling movement of Kao-Wagwattl helped me or I wouldn't\nhave succeeded. We tumbled into the crevice.\n\nThen I scrambled upward. Another glimpse of Gravgak. He dived down\namong the crevices, moving in our direction. A moment of darkness. The\nscale-tops closed out the light. When they opened, he was there, coming\nat us.\n\nI locked with him. We fought. The movement of the surfaces gave us an\nupward thrust. I kicked and tumbled to the surface. He caught my wrist,\nbut the upthrust of the Kao favored me and I jerked him upward, onto\nthe top of the scales.\n\nWe fought in the open. The rubbery footing was deadly, but it played\nno favorites. I struck a heavy blow that made the green-and-black lined\narms shudder. Gravgak's eyes flashed as he plunged back at me. I struck\nhim again, with the full force of my body. He bounced and tumbled. He\nrolled out of sight. But not for long. It was an intentional trick. He\ndisappeared in the crevice where Leeger had fallen. When he came up,\nthe bloody knife was in his hand. I heard Vauna's warning cry.\n\nI leaped down into the crevice. She was trying to get my coat. She knew\nthere were explosives in it, if she could only get them into my hands.\n\nNo time for that. Gravgak leaped down at me. The knife was rigid from\nhis hand, coming down with a plunge. I kicked back, floundering against\nthe tricky walls of the scales, and Gravgak fell down deep where I had\nbeen. I saw it happen. A sight I never expect to see repeated.\n\nHis descent to the base of the scales, where the walls joined, might\nhave been a harmless fall. Yet who knows how sensitive is the material\nof the vast living thing called Kao-Wagwattl? The knife plunged into\ndeep _Kao flesh_ beneath our feet. The flesh opened. Gravgak\nwhirled, tried to escape the opening. His arm twisted under him. And\nwent down. As if something drew it. His back--his whole body, from\nhips to shoulders--was caught in the gaping hole that he had seemingly\nopened with a plunge of the knife blade. It closed on him. It severed\nhim. Part of him was gone. Before our eyes there remained his legs, cut\nclean away. And his head, and part of one shoulder.\n\nThe rest of him? It would not return to sight. Kao-Wagwattl was a\nliving thing. When it wished it could devour.\n\nMany of the tribe came back to this spot to examine what remained of\nthe traitorous guard. I too observed him closely. I examined his eyes\nwith a glass. Also the eyes of the murdered Leeger. Neither showed any\ntraces of eyelashes or eyebrows.\n\n\n12.\n\nThe tribe rode on tranquilly. There would be new legends of\nKao-Wagwattl, after what had occurred. Many were the stories, and I\nrelayed them to Campbell, at the ship, who faithfully recorded them all.\n\nThere was a tragedy to be added. It could not have been otherwise. For\nsome months the news of Omosla and her little daughter had been vague.\nIt was the Benzendella tradition that weddings should not be delayed\nfor long after the arrival of the first-born child. It was rumored that\nthis young mother now faced the shame of having been left without a\nmate. It was hard to get exact information. Even though Vauna and I had\nalways sought an understanding between us, some things were not talked\nabout freely. Deepest, most important truths in new worlds are often\nthe most elusive. Now I questioned Vauna closely, and I learned of the\ntragic end of Omosla.\n\n\"She and her baby are no longer with us,\" Vauna said quietly. \"It\nhappened one night when the stars seemed very close. They say she had\nstudied the sky each night, wondering which of the worlds beyond was\nthe world of Campbell.\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"Two of her caretakers saw it happen, but they could not stop it. With\nthe babe in her arms, she walked over the side of Kao-Wagwattl. And\nwent down. Under.\"\n\nVauna went on to tell me that Tomboldo had urged silence about it.\nHe would always believe that the girl had lost faith too soon--that\nCampbell might have come back when his work was done. Moreover,\nTomboldo felt that it was important to the morale of the tribe that\nboth Campbell and I be held in high esteem.\n\nWhen Vauna finished telling me these things, she said she would ask me\nthe questions she had been saving for many days. \"Did you believe, Jim,\nthat you would find some other person among us from your world?\"\n\n\"I didn't know.\"\n\n\"If you had found such a person, what would you have believed then?\"\n\n\"That he, and not Campbell, was the father of Omosla's child.\"\n\n\"And what,\" Vauna asked, \"are you going to believe about us when our\nchild is born?\"\n\n\n13.\n\nWe were around on the other side of the planet by now. I estimated that\nwe had traveled more than seven thousand hours.\n\nBy this time many things had happened. So much that I doubted my\nability to convey all the news to Campbell so that he would get a clear\nunderstanding. I had lain awake nights trying to formulate my message.\nIf my words failed, I only hoped that my tone of voice would convey my\nappreciation. My appreciation of him. Of what he had gone through. Of\nwhat he must yet go through.\n\nHe talked with me quietly through the radio, and I could visualize him\nas if I were sitting beside him again in the space ship.\n\n\"Yes, Linden. Go on. I'm listening.\"\n\nI told him of the death of Omosla and the child. He was deeply grieved.\nIt was a long time before he found voice to speak.\n\n\"Go ahead, Linden. I'm listening.\"\n\n\"I have more news,\" I said. \"But tell me of yourself, Campbell. Have\nyou gone ahead, playing your lone hand?\"\n\n\"I've found my way into the customs of the savages, Linden. They\nhave their own legends of Kao-Wagwattl. I can predict that in time\nthe gap can be bridged between them and the Benzendellas. If we work\ncarefully--men like you, Linden, working from within, and other agents\nfrom EGGWE that are sure to follow. I believe this planet can be spared\nthe torments of great wars.\"\n\n\"Yes, Campbell ... and you, personally ... are you well? Are you still\nbristling with your usual self-discipline?\"\n\n\"In case you have any doubts about the matter,\" his voice was slightly\ncaustic, \"I haven't broken the Code.\"\n\n\"In Omosla's case I wish you had,\" I said.\n\n\"I wish it too,\" Campbell's voice came back, now in a lowered tone. \"I\nloved Omosla. I would have been her mate, gladly.\"\n\n\"But you were, Campbell.\"\n\n\"Now, don't start that again, Linden, or I'll--\"\n\n\"Wait, Campbell, don't cut me off. You must hear all of my news, first.\nMost important of all, old Tomboldo has chosen my own son to be his\nsuccessor. He'll be groomed for the job all through his childhood, and\nI've decided to stay right here, Code or no Code, and see him through.\"\n\n\"Your _son_?\" Campbell's voice was mostly breath. \"Who are you\ntalking about?\"\n\n\"Our baby--Vauna's and mine. It's several days old. Doing fine. Has\neyebrows just like mine. Chalk-dust skin like hers.\"\n\nCampbell blurted. \"Do you mean to tell me that as soon as you and Vauna\nboarded the Kao--\"\n\n\"The ways of life on this planet are something you and I ought to know\nabout, Campbell. Listen closely--\"\n\n\"Shoot!\"\n\nIn words of one syllable I explained, then, what I had at last learned:\nthat the human beings of this planet were not precisely like those\nof the Earth. They were unquestionably related, somewhere back down\nthrough the ages. But Nature had worked a significant change in the\nprocess by which new life could be started. Fertilization in the female\nwas accomplished by her own action and her own preference. Nature had\nequipped her arms--\n\n\"Arms, did you say?\" Campbell fairly shouted through the radio. \"Go on.\"\n\nI continued. Nature had equipped her arms, I explained, with tiny\nthorn-like projections which could penetrate the arms or sides of the\nmale like needles. By this means she drew blood from his bloodstream. A\nvery slight transfusion of male blood into the female bloodstream was\nthe act that accomplished fertilization.\n\n\"You see, Campbell, woman does not bear a child except by her own\npremeditated choice,\" I explained. \"You and I were puzzled by the elbow\nfurs all these women wear. Now you see. It's a natural bit of extra\nclothing. The dictates of modesty.\"\n\n\"Well!\" Campbell said. \"Then you and I allowed ourselves--\"\n\n\"We were simply chosen. Not knowing the score, we were innocent\nbystanders--well, more or less innocent--and pitifully ignorant.\nUnfortunately for us, these were matters the Benzendellas don't talk\nabout freely.\"\n\nCampbell paused for a moment of confused thinking. \"Just a minute,\nCaptain. I've been observing these savages--home life and all. There's\nno lack of normal affections among them, in our own sense of the word.\nThey're equipped physically, just as we are--plus the arm thorns. They\nhave the same organs, the same functions--\"\n\n\"For purposes of affection, yes. But the arms--that's separate--for\nconception.\"\n\n\"Well I'll be blasted!\" Campbell was speechless for a long moment.\nThen, \"I think I'll go back to Earth.\"\n\nI was not surprised at his decision. It was what I expected, what\nI would have advised. He had had more than one man's share of this\nplanet, for one who didn't expect to take root here. But my own life\nhere was just beginning.\n\nI had thought it out. My guess was that my long record of service for\nthe EGGWE could withstand some variation. An application for release\nwould very likely win an approval, especially in view of my change to\nserve the EGGWE purposes even better by becoming a Benzendella.\n\nWhen I announced this plan, by radio, to the new Captain Campbell,\nformerly known as Split, but now commonly referred to on this planet as\nthe hero of the Benzendella migration, he said he was not surprised.\n\"Congratulations, Linden, for knowing what you wanted. Stay aboard that\nKao-Wagwattl. There's a beautiful land waiting for you up ahead.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Serpent River, by Don Wilcox\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE SERPENT RIVER ***\n\n***** This file should be named 50923.txt or 50923.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/0/9/2/50923/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
