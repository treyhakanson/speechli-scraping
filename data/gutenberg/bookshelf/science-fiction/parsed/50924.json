Dexter Foote turned\ninto the side road that the arrow indicated.\n\nHe had no way of knowing it at the time, but by his action he condemned\nhis new convertible to a fate worse than death.\n\nThe side road meandered down a long slope into a wooded hollow where a\nbreeze born of cool bowers and shaded brooks made the July afternoon\nheat less oppressive. A quantity of the pique that had been with him\never since setting forth from the city departed. There were worse\nassignments, after all, than writing up a fallen star.\n\nAbruptly he applied the brakes and brought the convertible to a\nscreeching halt. His blue eyes started from his boyish face.\n\nWell they might. The two Humpty Dumptyish creatures squatting in the\nmiddle of the road were as big as heavy tanks and, judging from their\n\"skin tone,\" were constructed of similar material. They had arms like\njointed cranes and legs like articulated girders. Their scissors-like\nmouths were slightly open, exposing maws the hue of an open hearth at\ntapping time. Either they were all body and no head, or all head and no\nbody. Whichever was the case, they had both eyes and ears. The former\nhad something of the aspect of peek holes in a furnace door, while the\nlatter brought to mind lopsided Tv antennae.\n\nAs Dexter watched, the foremost of the two metallic monsters advanced\nupon the convertible and began licking the chrome off the grill with a\nlong, tong-like tongue. Meanwhile, its companion circled to the rear\nand took a big bite out of the trunk. There was an awesome CRUNCH! and\nthe convertible gave a convulsive shudder.\n\nAt this point, Dexter got out and ran. More accurately, he jumped\nout and ran. A hundred feet down the road, he stopped and turned. He\nwas just in time to see monster No. 1 bite off the right headlight.\nCRUNCH! Not to be outdone, monster No. 2 bit off the right taillight.\nCRUNCH-CRUNCH! An acrid odor affronted Dexter's nostrils, and he\ndiscerned a faint yellow haze hovering about the convertible. The\nrear wheels went in two bites. The 250 H.P. motor required three.\nCRUNCH-CRUNCH-CRUNCH! The upholstery caught fire and began to burn. A\ngout of flame shot up as the gas tank exploded. Far from discouraging\nthe two monsters, the resultant inferno merely served to whet their\nappetites. CRUNCH-CRUNCH-CRUNCH-CRUNCH!\n\nDexter's shoulders sagged, and the spot next to his heart that the\nconvertible had shared with his best girl gave a spasmodic twinge.\nRemoving his suitcoat and slinging it over his shoulder, he turned his\nback on the grisly repast and set out sadly for Sugardale.\n\nHe had not gone far before his stalled thought-processes got into gear\nagain.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe falling star he had been assigned by his editor to write up had\nbeen an unusually brilliant one according to the report the paper\nhad received. Maybe its unusualness did not stop there. Maybe it was\nsomething more than a mere meteorite. Certainly the two monsters could\nnot be classified as local woodland creatures.\n\nAll of which was fine as far as copy was concerned. But it didn't bring\nhis convertible back.\n\nPresently he saw two sizable deposits of slag at the side of the road,\nand approaching them more closely, he discovered that they were still\nwarm. Could they be the remains of a previously devoured automobile? he\nwondered. What an ignominious fate indeed to overtake a car! He looked\nat the two deposits once more before moving on. All he could think of\nwere two piles of elephant dung.\n\nA mile and half later, he emerged in a small valley that sported a\nhandful of houses, a scattering of business places, a church or two\nand a goodly number of trees. A roadside sign informed him that he\nhad reached his destination, that its population was 350, and that\nits speed limit was 20 mph. The population, however, was nowhere in\nevidence, and the speed limit seemed silly in view of the absence of\ncars.\n\nA scared-looking housewife, upon whose door he knocked, told him\nhe'd probably find the local minion of the law at the Sugardale Inn,\n\"sucking up beer the way he always is when he should be out earning\nhis money.\" The Inn turned out to be a sagging three-story structure\nin desperate need of a paint-job. There was a model A sedan parked\nin front of it, the first automobile Dexter had seen. Formerly the\nestablishment had provided a haven for weary travelers. Now it provided\na haven for contented cockroaches. Its _fin de si\u00e8cle_ bar was a\ncollector's item, and standing at it, one foot propped on the brass\nbar-rail, was a lone customer. He was tall and thin, and somewhere in\nhis sixties, and he was wearing blue denim trousers and a blue chambray\nshirt. There was a lackluster badge pinned on the fading shirtfront,\nand a beat-up sombrero sat atop the graying head.\n\n\"Sheriff Jeremiah Smith at your service,\" he said calmly when Dexter\ndashed up to him. He took a sip from the schooner of beer that sat on\nthe bar before him. \"Got troubles, have you, young man?\"\n\n\"My car,\" Dexter said. \"I was driving along the road and--\"\n\n\"Got ate up, did it? Well, it's not the first one to get ate up around\nhere.\" Jeremiah Smith faced the doorway that led to the lobby. \"Mrs.\nCreasy, get this young man a beer,\" he called.\n\nA plump middle-aged woman whose dark hair fell down over her eyes like\na thicket came into sight behind the bar. She flicked a cockroach off\nthe drain-board with an expert forefinger, drew Dexter a schooner and\nset it before him. Jeremiah Smith paid for it. \"Drink her down, young\nman,\" he said. \"I know how _I'd_ feel if _my_ car got ate up.\"\n\nManfully, Dexter dispatched half the contents of the schooner, after\nwhich he introduced himself and explained the nature of his mission\nto Sugardale. \"I never figured on anything like this, though,\" he\nconcluded.\n\n\"You must have made it through just before the road-block was set up,\"\nJeremiah said. \"You were lucky.\"\n\nDexter started at him. \"Lucky! I lost my _car_.\"\n\n\"Pshaw. What's a car to a newspaper man when a Big Story's in the air?\nTake this newspaper fellow I saw on TV Saturday night. He--\"\n\n\"Big Stories went out long ago,\" Dexter said. \"Newspapermen work for a\nliving the same as anybody else. Get back to my car. Aren't you going\nto do anything about it?\"\n\nJeremiah looked hurt. \"I've already done everything I can do. The\nminute I saw those tanks I knew it was a job for the army, and the\nstate police agreed with me. So we notified them, after which we\nadvised everybody to stay indoors and to keep their cars under lock and\nkey. All we can do now is wait.\" Jeremiah sighed. \"Crazy, if you ask\nme. Tanks eating automobiles!\"\n\n\"I imagine,\" Dexter said thoughtfully, \"that our diet would give them\npause too. Where did this star of yours fall?\"\n\n\"In Ed Hallam's north timber lot. Take you there, if you like. There's\nnot much to see, though--just a big hole in the ground.\"\n\nDexter finished his beer. \"Come on,\" he said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Model A parked in front of the Inn turned out to be Jeremiah's.\nThey took off down the road at a brisk pace, wound through woods,\ndales, pastures and fields. Dexter hadn't the remotest idea where he\nwas when at last Jeremiah pulled up beside a grove larger and darker\nthan the others.\n\nThe old man squinted into the lengthening shadows. \"Seems to me them\nauto-eating tanks ought to make better reading than a common ordinary\nfalling star.\"\n\nHalfway out of the car, Dexter stared at him. \"You mean to tell me you\ndon't see the connection?\"\n\n\"What connection?\"\n\nDexter got the rest of the way out. \"Between the automobile-eaters and\nthe spaceship, of course.\"\n\nJeremiah stared at _him_. \"What spaceship?\"\n\n\"Oh, never mind,\" Dexter said. \"Show me the fallen star.\"\n\nIt was in a clearing deep in the woods. Or rather, the crater-like\nhole it had made was. Peering down into the hole, Dexter saw the dark,\npitted surface of what could very well have been an ordinary, if\nunusually large, meteorite. There was nothing that suggested an opening\nof any kind, but the opposite wall of the crater did look as though\nsome heavy object had been dragged--or had dragged itself--up to the\nlevel of the clearing. The underbrush showed signs of having been\nbadly trampled in the recent past.\n\nHe pointed out the signs to Jeremiah. \"See how those saplings are\nflattened? No human being did that. I'll bet if we followed that trail,\nwe'd come to the remains of the first car they consumed. Whose car was\nit, by the way?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Hopkins's new Buick. She'd just started out for the city on one\nof her shopping trips. She was so scared when she came running back\ninto town her hair was standing straight out behind her head. Maybe,\nthough, it was because she was running so fast.\" Abruptly Jeremiah\nleaned forward and squinted at the ground. \"Looks almost like a big\nfootprint right there, don't it.\" He straightened. \"But if the darn\nthing is a spaceship like you say, how come it buried itself?\"\n\n\"Because whoever or whatever was piloting it didn't--or\ncouldn't--decelerate enough for an orthodox landing,\" Dexter explained.\n\"Lucky it hit the clearing. If it had hit the trees, you'd have had a\nforest fire on your hands.\"\n\nJeremiah looked worried. \"Maybe we'd better be getting back to the\nroad. I feel kind of guilty leaving my model A sitting there all alone.\"\n\nDexter followed him back through the woods and climbed into the front\nseat beside him. The road took them to the main highway, and not\nlong thereafter Jeremiah turned off the highway into another road--a\nfamiliar road heralded by a familiar sign that said, SUGARDALE THREE\nMILES. Two slag deposits marked the spot where once Dexter's proud\nconvertible had stood. He gazed at them sadly as they passed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSuddenly Jeremiah brought the model A to a screeching halt. The two\ndesecrators of the American Dream Incarnate were in the midst of\nanother repast. The victim this time, judging from the still-visible\nstar and the O.D. color scheme, was an army staff car. The grill and\nthe motor were already gone, and half of the roof was missing. Yellow\nhaze enshrouded the sorry scene, and the countryside was resounding to\na series of horrendous CRUNCHES.\n\n\"Do you think if I sort of zoomed by, we could make it?\" Jeremiah\nasked. \"I hate to go all the way around the other way.\"\n\n\"I'm game if you are,\" Dexter said.\n\nZOOOOOOMMMMMMM!\n\nThe two monsters didn't even look up.\n\n\"You'd think my model A wasn't good enough for them,\" Jeremiah said\npeevishly.\n\n\"Count your blessings. Look, there's someone up ahead.\"\n\nThe \"someone\" turned out to be a two-star general, a chicken colonel\nand an enlisted man. Jeremiah stopped, and the trio climbed into the\nback seat. \"Ate your staff car, did they, General?\" he chuckled, taking\noff again. \"Well, that's the way it goes.\"\n\n\"The name,\" said the general, whose middle-aged face had a greenish\ncast, \"is General Longcombe, and I was on my way to Sugardale to\nreconnoiter the situation before committing any troops to the area.\nThis is my aide, Colonel Mortby, and my driver, Sergeant Wilkins.\"\n\n\"Sheriff Smith at your service,\" said Jeremiah. \"This here's Dexter\nFoote, who came to Sugardale to do a Big Story on our falling star.\"\n\n\"Tell me about these VEMs of yours, sheriff,\" General Longcombe said.\n\nJeremiah twisted around. \"VEMs?\"\n\n\"'Vehicle-Eating Monsters',\" Colonel Mortby interposed. He was a small\nman with a pleasant youthful face. \"It's standard army operating\nprocedure to give an object a name before investigating it.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" Jeremiah twisted back again, saved the model A from going into\nthe ditch with a Herculean yank on the wheel. \"Well, Dexter here seems\nto think that our falling star is a spaceship and that they landed in\nit, and I'm inclined to believe he's right.\"\n\n\"After seeing the VEMs in person, I'm inclined to believe he's right\nmyself,\" Colonel Mortby said. \"I think that what we have to do with\nhere,\" he went on presently, when the general made no comment, \"is a\nform of metal-based life capable of generating an internal temperature\nof at least three thousand degrees Fahrenheit. The acrid odor they give\noff while 'feasting' probably arises from a substance analogous to our\ngastric juices which their heat-resistant stomachs supply to accomplish\n'digestion,' only in this case 'digestion' consists primarily in\nmelting down the metal they consume and in isolating its waste matter,\nafter which the pure metal is reprocessed into 'body tissue' and the\nwaste matter is thrown off in the form of slag. I think we might go so\nfar as to call them a couple of animate open hearths.\"\n\nDexter had turned around in the front seat and was looking at the\ncolonel admiringly. \"I think you've hit the nail right on the head,\nsir,\" he said.\n\nGeneral Longcombe was scowling. \"We're here to survey the situation,\nColonel, not to jump to conclusions.\" He addressed the back of\nJeremiah's weather-beaten neck. \"I trust we'll have no trouble finding\nsuitable accommodations in Sugardale, sheriff.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Creasy'll be glad to put you up at the Inn, if that's what you\nmean,\" Jeremiah said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMrs. Creasy was more than glad. Indeed, from the way she looked at the\ntwo officers and the NCO through her thicket of hair, you would have\nthought they were the first roomers she'd had in months, discounting\nthe cockroaches, of course.\n\nThe general said petulantly, \"Let's get down to business, Colonel.\nI want an armored company brought up immediately, and I want the\nfallen-star area put off limits at once. Have the sheriff show you\nwhere it is.\" He turned to Sergeant Wilkins. \"Sergeant, get on the\nphone as soon as the colonel gets off it, and arrange for my personal\nCadillac to be delivered here first thing.\"\n\nAfter phoning his paper, Dexter headed for the dining room and sat down\nbeside General Longcombe. \"Anything new on the VEMs, General?\" he asked.\n\nGeneral Longcombe sighed. There were shadows under his eyes, and his\ncheeks showed signs of sagging. \"They're still in circulation. Scared\nthe wits out of a couple of teenagers and ate their hot-rod. We've\ngot them under constant surveillance, of course, and what with all the\nunderbrush they trample it's easy enough to track them. But we can't\nstop them. They eat our gas grenades and our fragmentation grenades,\nand they're impervious to our tank killers and our antitank mines. A\nsmall A-bomb would take care of them nicely, but even assuming there's\nan area around here large enough and isolated enough to permit us to\nuse an A-bomb, there's no way of herding them into it.\"\n\n\"It just so happens that there is such an area,\" Jeremiah Smith said.\n\"Tillson Valley--about ten miles south of here. You'd have to vacate\nOld Man Tillson, of course, but he'd be glad to go if you made it worth\nhis while. He hasn't grown a thing but weeds anyway since he got his\npension. Just sits around all day and sucks up beer.\"\n\n\"But there's still no way of getting the VEMs out there,\" General\nLongcombe objected.\n\n\"Tell me, general,\" Dexter said, \"have they eaten any of your jeeps or\ntrucks or personnel carriers?\"\n\nGeneral Longcombe shook his head. \"They've had plenty of opportunity\nto, too.\"\n\n\"I have a theory,\" Dexter said.\n\nThe look that promptly settled on General Longcombe's face made no\nbones about what he thought of presumptuous young reporters with\ntheories. Colonel Mortby, however, was considerably less biased. \"It\nwon't do any harm to listen to what he's got to say, sir,\" he pointed\nout, \"and it may even do some good. It'll be at least a day before the\nship is excavated and even then we may not know any more about the sort\nof life forms we're dealing with than we do now.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDexter needed no further invitation. \"I think it's pretty clear by\nnow,\" he began, \"that our two visitors from Planet X aren't attracted\nby metal in just any old form at all, but by metal in the form of new,\nor nearly new, automobiles. This strongly suggests that their landing\nwas unpremeditated, because if it had been premeditated they would have\ncome down in a section of the country where such metallic concoctions\nare in plentiful supply--near a city or a large town, or close to a\nheavily traveled throughway.\n\n\"But what is it about these new cars of ours that they find so\nirresistible? Let's try an analogy. Suppose that one of us has gone\ninto a bakery to buy a birthday cake and that money is no object.\nWhich cake is he most likely to buy? The answer is obvious: the one\nwith the most visual appeal. To return to our visitors from Planet X.\nSuppose that all their lives they've been eating metal in various but\nuninspired ingot forms--the metallic equivalents, let's say, of beans\nand bread and hominy grits. Now suppose they find their way to another\nplanet where visual appeal in metallic creation is a major occupation,\nand suppose that shortly after disembarking from their spaceship they\ncome upon a new convertible. Wouldn't they react in the same way we\nwould react if all our lives our diet had been confined to beans and\nbread and hominy grits and _we_ traveled to another planet, disembarked\nand came upon a delicious birthday cake just begging to be eaten?\nWouldn't they make pigs of themselves and start looking for more cakes?\"\n\n\"But if it's the ornate nature of our late-model cars that attracts\nthem, why did they eat the staff car?\" Colonel Mortby asked. \"And why\ndid they eat the teenager's hot rod, and our gas and fragmentation\ngrenades?\"\n\n\"I suggest,\" Dexter said, \"that they ate the staff car because at the\nmoment there weren't any other cars immediately available. As for the\nteenager's hot rod, I imagine it was loaded down with enough chrome\naccessories to sink a battleship. And as for the grenades--your men\nthrew them at them first, did they not?\"\n\nColonel Mortby nodded. \"I see what you mean. Sort of like throwing\ncandy to a baby. I'll buy your theory, Mr. Foote.\"\n\n\"And now, if I may,\" Dexter continued, \"I'd like to propose a means of\ngetting rid of our unwanted visitors from Planet X.\"\n\nGeneral Longcombe sighed. \"Very well, Mr. Foote. Go on.\"\n\n\"You mentioned earlier, sir, that there was no way of herding the VEMs\ninto an isolated area. However, I think there is a way. Suppose we were\nto remove all of the automobiles from the vicinity with the exception\nof one, and suppose we were to park that one in the middle of Tillson\nValley as bait, with a remote-controlled A-bomb underneath it?\"\n\n\"But how would they know that the bait was there?\"\n\n\"Through association,\" Dexter said. \"All of the automobiles they've\nconsumed thus far were in operation shortly before they began to eat\nthem, so by now they must have established an unconscious relationship\nbetween the sound of the motors and the taste of the metal. Therefore,\nif we keep the bait idling and set up a P.A. system to amplify the\nsound, eventually they'll hear it, their mouths will salivate and\nthey'll come running.\"\n\nGeneral Longcombe offered no comment He appeared to be deep in thought.\n\n\"My car is in West Virginia,\" Colonel Mortby said.\n\n\"My car was eaten,\" Dexter said.\n\nGeneral Longcombe opened his mouth. \"My car--\" he began.\n\nSergeant Wilkins entered the room and saluted smartly. \"The general's\nCadillac has just arrived, sir,\" he said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOld man Tillson co-operated readily enough, once he was assured that\nhe would be indemnified not only for his ramshackle house but for the\nyoung mountain of beer bottles that stood in his back yard, and the\ncommand post was moved forthwith to the lip of the valley. Jeremiah\nSmith was allowed to go along as an observer, and Dexter was accorded\na similar favor. By evening, everything was in place. The colonel's\nCadillac, parked in the valley's center, had something of the aspect of\na chrome-bedizened lamb resting on an altar of crab grass, buttercups\nand mustard weeds. Surrounding it were half a dozen floodlights,\nsuspended over it was a microphone, standing next to it was a pole\nsupporting three P.A. speakers, and located several hundred feet away\nwas a TV camera. Beyond this impressive  display, Old Man Tillson's\nhomestead could be discerned, and beyond the homestead rose his\nmountainous collection of beer bottles.\n\nColonel Mortby came out of the command-post tent and walked over to\nwhere Dexter and Jeremiah were standing, looking down into the valley.\nHe handed each of them a pair of cobalt-blue glasses. \"If you watch the\nblast, make sure you wear these,\" he said, raising his voice above the\namplified purring of the Cadillac's motor. \"You'll be glad to hear that\nthe two VEMs are already on their way, Mr. Foote--our walkie-talkie\nsquad just called in. However, the creatures move so slowly that they\nprobably won't be here before dawn.\"\n\nDexter came out of a brown study. \"One thing still bugs me,\" he said.\n\"Why should two members of a race of extraterrestrials technically\nintelligent enough to build spaceships behave like a pair of gluttonous\nsavages the minute they land on another planet?\"\n\n\"But you explained that,\" Jeremiah pointed out. \"They just can't resist\neating American automobiles.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I got carried away by my analogy. Civilized beings simply\ndon't go running across the countryside the minute they land, and start\ngrabbing up everything that strikes their eye. They make contact\nwith the authorities first, and _then_ they go running across the\ncountryside and start grabbing up everything that strikes their eye.\"\n\nColonel Mortby grinned. \"You've got a good point there, Mr. Foote.\nWell, I'm going to see if I can't grab forty winks or so--it's been a\ntrying day.\"\n\n\"Me too,\" Jeremiah said, heading for his model A.\n\nLeft alone, Dexter wedged a flashlight in the fork of a little tree,\nsat down in its dim radiance, got out pen and notebook, and began his\narticle. _The Solid Cheese Cadillac_, he wrote, _by Dexter Foote_....\n\nDawn found him dozing over page 16. \"There they are!\" someone shouted,\njerking him awake. \"The filthy fiends!\"\n\nThe \"someone\" was General Longcombe. Joining him, Dexter saw the two\nVEMs. They were moving relentlessly across the valley floor toward the\nhelpless Cadillac. Jeremiah came up, rubbing his eyes. Colonel Mortby\ncould be discerned through the entrance of the command-post tent,\nleaning over a technician's shoulder.\n\nThe two VEMs reached the Cadillac and began licking off the chrome with\ntheir long, tong-like tongues. General Longcombe went wild. He waved\nhis arms. \"Monsters!\" he screamed, \"I'll blow you to Kingdom Come\npersonally!\" and stomped into the tent.\n\nDexter and Jeremiah started to put on their cobalt-blue glasses.\nAbruptly thunder sounded, and a shadow darkened the land. Looking\nskyward, Dexter saw it--\n\nThe ship. The saucer. Whichever word you cared to apply to it. But\nwhichever noun you chose, you had to prefix it with the adjective\n\"gigantic,\" for the ventral hatch alone, which had just yawned open,\nwas large enough to accommodate the Sugardale Methodist Church.\n\nIn the command-post tent, the general, as yet unaware of the UFO's\npresence, was giving the countdown in an anguished voice. \"Two--\"\n\nIn the valley, the two VEMs were trying vainly to extricate themselves\nfrom a huge metallic net that had dropped over them.\n\n\"One--\"\n\nOn the lip of the valley, Dexter Foote was grappling with an insight.\n\n\"Zero--\"\n\nPfft!...\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"It wasn't a dud after all,\" General Longcombe said. \"They cancelled\nout the chain-reaction with some kind of a ray. I wonder....\" He shook\nhis head wistfully. \"What a weapon, though.\"\n\nHe and Colonel Mortby and the tech were standing by the chrome-stripped\ncarcass of the Cadillac. Dexter and Jeremiah had just come up. \"My\ntheory turned out to be a little bit off-center,\" Dexter said. \"You\nsee, I overlooked the possibility that our children aren't necessarily\nthe only galactic small fry who run away from home and get themselves\nin Dutch. My birthday-cake analogy still holds true, but I would have\ndone better to have compared our late-model automobiles to appetizing\ncandy bars, or Easter baskets filled with jelly beans and chocolate\nchickens.\"\n\nThe general regarded him blankly. \"I'm afraid I don't follow you at\nall, Mr. Foote.\"\n\n\"Did you ever turn a pair of hungry kids loose in a candy store, sir?\"\n\nUnderstanding came into General Longcombe's eyes then, and he turned\nand gazed sadly at his chromeless Cadillac. \"I wonder if they have\ncastor oil on Planet X,\" he said.\n\n\"I bet they have its equivalent,\" grinned Dexter Foote.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Sweet Tooth, by Robert F.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
