SMITH\n\n                         Illustrated by DILLON\n\n           [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n                  Galaxy Science Fiction March 1957.\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\n\n\n\n                Snaddra had but one choice in its fight\n             to afford to live belowground--underhandedly\n               pretend theirs was an aboveboard society!\n\n\n\"Go Away from me, Skkiru,\" Larhgan said, pushing his hand off her arm.\n\"A beggar does not associate with the high priestess of Snaddra.\"\n\n\"But the Earthmen aren't due for another fifteen minutes,\" Skkiru\nprotested.\n\n\"Of what importance are fifteen minutes compared to eternity!\" she\nexclaimed. Her lovely eyes fuzzed softly with emotion. \"You don't seem\nto realize, Skkiru, that this isn't just a matter of minutes or hours.\nIt's forever.\"\n\n\"Forever!\" He looked at her incredulously. \"You mean we're going to\nkeep this up as a permanent thing? You're joking!\"\n\nBbulas groaned, but Skkiru didn't care about that. The sad, sweet way\nLarhgan shook her beautiful head disturbed him much more, and when\nshe said, \"No, Skkiru, I am not joking,\" a tiny pang of doubt and\napprehension began to quiver in his second smallest left toe.\n\n\"This is, in effect, good-by,\" she continued. \"We shall see each other\nagain, of course, but only from a distance. On feast days, perhaps you\nmay be permitted to kiss the hem of my robe ... but that will be all.\"\n\nSkkiru turned to the third person present in the council chamber.\n\"Bbulas, this is your fault! It was all your idea!\"\n\nThere was regret on the Dilettante's thin face--an obviously insincere\nregret, the younger man knew, since he was well aware how Bbulas had\nalways felt about the girl.\n\n\"I am sorry, Skkiru,\" Bbulas intoned. \"I had fancied you understood.\nThis is not a game we are playing, but a new way of life we are\nadopting. A necessary way of life, if we of Snaddra are to keep on\nliving at all.\"\n\n\"It's not that I don't love you, Skkiru,\" Larhgan put in gently, \"but\nthe welfare of our planet comes first.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe had been seeing too many of the Terrestrial fictapes from the\nlibrary, Skkiru thought resentfully. There was too damn much Terran\ninfluence on this planet. And this new project was the last straw.\n\nNo longer able to control his rage and grief, he turned a triple\nsomersault in the air with rage. \"Then why was I made a beggar and she\nthe high priestess? You arranged that purposely, Bbulas. You--\"\n\n\"Now, Skkiru,\" Bbulas said wearily, for they had been through all this\nbefore, \"you know that all the ranks and positions were distributed\nby impartial lot, except for mine, and, of course, such jobs as could\ncarry over from the civilized into the primitive.\"\n\nBbulas breathed on the spectacles he was wearing, as contact lenses\nwere not considered backward enough for the kind of planet Snaddra\nwas now supposed to be, and attempted to wipe them dry on his robe.\nHowever, the thick, jewel-studded embroidery got in his way and so he\nwas forced to lift the robe and wipe all three of the lenses on the\nsmooth, soft, spun metal of his top underskirt.\n\n\"After all,\" he went on speaking as he wiped, \"I have to be high\npriest, since I organized this culture and am the only one here\nqualified to administer it. And, as the president himself concurred in\nthese arrangements, I hardly think you--a mere private citizen--have\nthe right to question them.\"\n\n\"Just because you went to school in another solar system,\" Skkiru said,\nwhirling with anger, \"you think you're so smart!\"\n\n\"I won't deny that I do have educational and cultural advantages\nwhich were, unfortunately, not available to the general populace of\nthis planet. However, even under the old system, I was always glad to\nutilize my superior attainments as Official Dilettante for the good of\nall and now--\"\n\n\"Sure, glad to have a chance to rig this whole setup so you could break\nup things between Larhgan and me. You've had your eye on her for some\ntime.\"\n\nSkkiru coiled his antennae at Bbulas, hoping the insult would provoke\nhim into an unbecoming whirl, but the Dilettante remained calm. One of\nthe chief outward signs of Terran-type training was self-control and\nBbulas had been thoroughly terranized.\n\n_I hate Terrestrials_, Skkiru said to himself. _I hate Terra._ The\nquiver of anxiety had risen up his leg and was coiling and uncoiling\nin his stomach. He hoped it wouldn't reach his antennae--if he were\nto break down and psonk in front of Larhgan, it would be the final\nhumiliation.\n\n\"Skkiru!\" the girl exclaimed, rotating gently, for she, like her\nfiance--her erstwhile fiance, that was, for the new regime had caused\nall such ties to be severed--and every other literate person on the\nplanet, had received her education at the local university. Although\nsound, the school was admittedly provincial in outlook and very poor\nin the emotional department. \"One would almost think that the lots had\nsome sort of divine intelligence behind them, because you certainly are\nbehaving in a beggarly manner!\"\n\n\"And I have already explained to you, Skkiru,\" Bbulas said, with a\npatience much more infuriating than the girl's anger, \"that I had no\nidea of who was to become my high priestess. The lots chose Larhgan. It\nis, as the Earthmen say, kismet.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe adjusted the fall of his glittering robe before the great polished\nfour-dimensional reflector that formed one wall of the chamber.\n\n_Kismet_, Skkiru muttered to himself, _and a little sleight of hand._\nBut he didn't dare offer this conclusion aloud; the libel laws of\nSnaddra were very severe. So he had to fall back on a weak, \"And I\nsuppose it is kismet that makes us all have to go live out on the\nground during the day, like--like savages.\"\n\n\"It is necessary,\" Bbulas replied without turning.\n\n\"Pooh,\" Skkiru said. \"Pooh, _pooh_, POOH!\"\n\nLarhgan's dainty earflaps closed. \"Skkiru! Such language!\"\n\n\"As you said,\" Bbulas murmured, contemptuously coiling one antenna at\nSkkiru, \"the lots chose well and if you touch me, Skkiru, we shall have\nanother drawing for beggar and you will be made a metal-worker.\"\n\n\"But I can't work metal!\"\n\n\"Then that will make it much worse for you than for the other\noutcasts,\" Bbulas said smugly, \"because you will be a pariah without a\ntrade.\"\n\n\"Speaking of pariahs, that reminds me, Skkiru, before I forget, I'd\nbetter give you back your grimpatch--\" Larhgan handed the glittering\nbauble to him--\"and you give me mine. Since we can't be betrothed any\nlonger, you might want to give yours to some nice beggar girl.\"\n\n\"I don't want to give my grimpatch to some nice beggar girl!\" Skkiru\nyelled, twirling madly in the air.\n\n\"As for me,\" she sighed, standing soulfully on her head, \"I do not\nthink I shall ever marry. I shall make the religious life my career.\nAre there going to be any saints in your mythos, Bbulas?\"\n\n\"Even if there will be,\" Bbulas said, \"you certainly won't qualify if\nyou keep putting yourself into a position which not only represents a\ntrait wholly out of keeping with the new culture, but is most unseemly\nwith the high priestess's robes.\"\n\nLarhgan ignored his unfeeling observations. \"I shall set myself apart\nfrom mundane affairs,\" she vowed, \"and I shall pretend to be happy,\neven though my heart will be breaking.\"\n\nIt was only at that moment that Skkiru realized just how outrageous the\nwhole thing really was. There must be another solution to the planet's\nproblem. \"Listen--\" he began, but just then excited noises filtered\ndown from overhead. It was too late.\n\n\"Earth ship in view!\" a squeaky voice called through the intercom.\n\"Everybody topside and don't forget your shoes.\"\n\nExcept the beggar. Beggars went barefoot. Beggars suffered. Bbulas had\nmade him beggar purposely, and the lots were a lot of slibwash.\n\n\"Hurry up, Skkiru.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBbulas slid the ornate headdress over his antennae, which, already\ngilded and jeweled, at once seemed to become a part of it. He looked\npretty damn silly, Skkiru thought, at the same time conscious of his\nown appearance--which was, although picturesque enough to delight\nromantic Terrestrial hearts, sufficiently wretched to charm the most\nhardened sadist.\n\n\"Hurry up, Skkiru,\" Bbulas said. \"They mustn't suspect the existence of\nthe city underground or we're finished before we've started.\"\n\n\"For my part, I wish we'd never started,\" Skkiru grumbled. \"What was\nwrong with our old culture, anyway?\"\n\nThat was intended as a rhetorical question, but Bbulas answered it\nanyway. He always answered questions; it had never seemed to penetrate\nhis mind that school-days were long since over.\n\n\"I've told you a thousand times that our old culture was too much like\nthe Terrans' own to be of interest to them,\" he said, with affected\nweariness. \"After all, most civilized societies are basically similar;\nit is only primitive societies that differ sharply, one from the\nother--and we have to be different to attract Earthmen. They're pretty\nchoosy. You've got to give them what they want, and that's what they\nwant. Now take up your post on the edge of the field, try to look\nhungry, and remember this isn't for you or for me, but for Snaddra.\"\n\n\"For Snaddra,\" Larhgan said, placing her hand over her anterior heart\nin a gesture which, though devout on Earth--or so the fictapes seemed\nto indicate--was obscene on Snaddra, owing to the fact that certain\nessential organs were located in different areas in the Snaddrath than\nin the corresponding Terrestrial life-form. Already the Terrestrial\ninfluence was corrupting her, Skkiru thought mournfully. She had been\nsuch a nice girl, too.\n\n\"We may never meet on equal terms again, Skkiru,\" she told him, with a\nlong, soulful glance that made his hearts sink down to his quivering\ntoes, \"but I promise you there will never be anyone else for me--and\nI hope that knowledge will inspire you to complete cooperation with\nBbulas.\"\n\n\"If that doesn't,\" Bbulas said, \"I have other methods of inspiration.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Skkiru answered sulkily. \"I'll go to the edge of the\nfield, and I'll speak broken Inter-galactic, and I'll forsake my normal\nhabits and customs, and I'll even _beg_. But I don't have to like doing\nit, and I don't intend to like doing it.\"\n\nAll three of Larhgan's eyes fuzzed with emotion. \"I'm proud of you,\nSkkiru,\" she said brokenly.\n\nBbulas sniffed. The three of them floated up to ground level in a\ntriple silence.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Alms, for the love of Ipsnadd,\" Skkiru chanted, as the two Terrans\ndescended from the ship and plowed their way through the mud to meet a\nprocession of young Snaddrath dressed in elaborate ceremonial costumes,\nand singing a popular ballad--to which less ribald, as well as less\ninspiring, words than the originals had been fitted by Bbulas, just\nin case, by some extremely remote chance, the Terrans had acquired a\nsmattering of Snadd somewhere. Since neither party was accustomed to\nnavigating mud, their progress was almost imperceptible.\n\n\"Alms, for the love of Ipsnadd,\" chanted Skkiru the beggar.\nHis teeth chattered as he spoke, for the rags he wore had been\ncustom-weatherbeaten for him by the planet's best tailor--now a pariah,\nof course, because Snadd tailors were, naturally, metal-workers--and\nthe wind and the rain were joyously making their way through the\ndemolished wires. Never before had Skkiru been on the surface of the\nplanet, except to pass over, and he had actually touched it only when\ntaking off and landing. The Snaddrath had no means of land transport,\nhaving previously found it unnecessary--but now both air-cars and\nself-levitation were on the prohibited list as being insufficiently\nprimitive.\n\nThe outside was no place for a civilized human being, particularly\nin the wet season or--more properly speaking on Snaddra--the wetter\nseason. Skkiru's feet were soaked with mud; not that the light sandals\nworn by the members of the procession appeared to be doing them much\ngood, either. It gave him a kind of melancholy pleasure to see that the\nprivileged ones were likewise trying to repress shivers. Though their\ncostumes were rich, they were also scanty, particularly in the case\nof the females, for Earthmen had been reported by tape and tale to be\nhumanoid.\n\nAs the mud clutched his toes, Skkiru remembered an idea he had once\ngotten from an old sporting fictape of Terrestrial origin and had\nalways planned to experiment with, but had never gotten around to--the\nweather had always been so weathery, there were so many other more\ncomfortable sports, Larhgan had wanted him to spend more of his leisure\nhours with her, and so on. However, he still had the equipment, which\nhe'd salvaged from a wrecked air-car, in his apartment--and it was the\nmatter of a moment to run down, while Bbulas was looking the other way,\nand get it.\n\nBbulas couldn't really object, Skkiru stilled the nagging quiver in\nhis toe, because what could be more primitive than any form of land\ntransport? And even though it took time to get the things, they worked\nso well that, in spite of the procession's head start, he was at the\nEarth ship long before the official greeters had reached it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe newcomers were indeed humanoid, he saw. Only the peculiarly\npasty color of their skins and their embarrassing lack of antennae\ndistinguished them visibly from the Snaddrath. They were dressed much\nas the Snaddrath had been before they had adopted primitive garb.\n\nIn fact, the Terrestrials were quite decent-looking life-forms,\nentirely different from the foppish monsters Skkiru had somehow\nexpected to represent the cultural ruling race. Of course, he had\nfrequently seen pictures of them, but everyone knew how easily those\ncould be retouched. Why, it was the Terrestrials themselves, he had\nalways understood, who had invented the art of retouching--thus proving\nbeyond a doubt that they had something to hide.\n\n\"Look, Raoul,\" the older of the two Earthmen said in Terran--which\nthe Snaddrath were not, according to the master plan, supposed to\nunderstand, but which most of them did, for it was the fashionable\nthird language on most of the outer planets. \"A beggar. Haven't seen\none since some other chaps and I were doing a spot of field work on\nthat little planet in the Arcturus system--what was its name? Glotch,\nthat's it. Very short study, it turned out to be. Couldn't get more\nthan a pamphlet out of it, as we were unable to stay long enough to\namass enough material for a really definitive work. The natives tried\nto eat us, so we had to leave in somewhat of a hurry.\"\n\n\"Oh, they were cannibals?\" the other Earthman asked, so respectfully\nthat it was easy to deduce he was the subordinate of the two. \"How\nhorrible!\"\n\n\"No, not at all,\" the other assured him. \"They weren't human--another\nspecies entirely--so you could hardly call it cannibalism. In fact, it\nwas quite all right from the ethical standpoint, but abstract moral\nconsiderations seemed less important to us than self-preservation\njust then. Decided that, in this case, it would be best to let the\nmissionaries get first crack at them. Soften them up, you know.\"\n\n\"And the missionaries--did they soften them up, Cyril?\"\n\n\"They softened up the missionaries, I believe.\" Cyril laughed. \"Ah,\nwell, it's all in the day's work.\"\n\n\"I hope these creatures are not man-eaters,\" Raoul commented, with\na polite smile at Cyril and an apprehensive glance at the oncoming\nprocession--_creatures indeed_! Skkiru thought, with a mental sniff.\n\"We have come such a long and expensive way to study them that it would\nbe indeed a pity if we also were forced to depart in haste. Especially\nsince this is my first field trip and I would like to make good at it.\"\n\n\"Oh, you will, my boy, you will.\" Cyril clapped the younger man on the\nshoulder. \"I have every confidence in your ability.\"\n\nEither he was stupid, Skkiru thought, or he was lying, in spite of\nBbulas' asseverations that untruth was unknown to Terrestrials--which\nhad always seemed highly improbable, anyway. How could any intelligent\nlife-form possibly stick to the truth all the time? It wasn't human; it\nwasn't even humanoid; it wasn't even polite.\n\n\"The natives certainly appear to be human enough,\" Raoul added, with\nan appreciative glance at the females, who had been selected for the\nprocessional honor with a view to reported Terrestrial tastes. \"Some\nslight differences, of course--but, if two eyes are beautiful, three\neyes can be fifty per cent lovelier, and chartreuse has always been my\nfavorite color.\"\n\n_If they stand out here in the cold much longer, they are going to turn\nbright yellow._ His own skin, Skkiru knew, had faded from its normal\nhealthy emerald to a sickly celadon.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCyril frowned and his companion's smile vanished, as if the contortion\nof his superior's face had activated a circuit somewhere. _Maybe the\nlittle one's a robot!_ However, it couldn't be--a robot would be better\nconstructed and less interested in females than Raoul.\n\n\"Remember,\" Cyril said sternly, \"we must not establish undue rapport\nwith the native females. It tends to detract from true objectivity.\"\n\n\"Yes, Cyril,\" Raoul said meekly.\n\nCyril assumed a more cheerful aspect \"I should like to give this chap\nsomething for old times' sake. What do you suppose is the medium of\nexchange here?\"\n\n_Money_, Skkiru said to himself, but he didn't dare contribute this\npiece of information, helpful though it would be.\n\n\"How should I know?\" Raoul shrugged.\n\n\"Empathize. Get in there, old chap, and start batting.\"\n\n\"Why not give him a bar of chocolate, then?\" Raoul suggested grumpily.\n\"The language of the stomach, like the language of love, is said to be\na universal one.\"\n\n\"Splendid idea! I always knew you had it in you, Raoul!\"\n\nSkkiru accepted the candy with suitable--and entirely genuine--murmurs\nof gratitude. Chocolate was found only in the most expensive of the\nplanet's delicacy shops--and now neither delicacy shops nor chocolate\nwere to be found, so, if Bbulas thought he was going to save the gift\nto contribute it later to the Treasury, the \"high priest\" was off his\nrocker.\n\nTo make sure there would be no subsequent dispute about possession,\nSkkiru ate the candy then and there. Chocolate increased the body's\nresistance to weather, and never before had he had to endure so much\nweather all at once.\n\nOn Earth, he had heard, where people lived exposed to weather, they\noften sickened of it and passed on--which helped to solve the problem\nof birth control on so vulgarly fecund a planet. Snaddra, alas, needed\nno such measures, for its population--like its natural resources--was\ndwindling rapidly. Still, Skkiru thought, as he moodily munched on the\nchocolate, it would have been better to flicker out on their own than\nto descend to a subterfuge like this for nothing more than survival.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBeing a beggar, Skkiru discovered, did give him certain small,\nmomentary advantages over those who had been alloted higher ranks.\nFor one thing, it was quite in character for him to tread curiously\nupon the strangers' heels all the way to the temple--a ramshackle\naffair, but then it had been run up in only three days--where the\nofficial reception was to be held. The principal difficulty was that,\nbecause of his equipment, he had a little trouble keeping himself from\novershooting the strangers. And though Bbulas might frown menacingly at\nhim--and not only for his forwardness--that was in character on both\nsides, too.\n\nNonetheless, Skkiru could not reconcile himself to his beggarhood, no\nmatter how much he tried to comfort himself by thinking at least he\nwasn't a pariah like the unfortunate metal-workers who had to stand\nsegregated from the rest by a chain of their own devising--a poetic\nthought, that was, but well in keeping with his beggarhood. Beggars\nwere often poets, he believed, and poets almost always beggars. Since\nmetal-working was the chief industry of Snaddra, this had provided the\nplanet automatically with a large lowest caste. Bbulas had taken the\neasy way out.\n\nSkkiru swallowed the last of the chocolate and regarded the \"high\npriest\" with a simple-minded mendicant's grin. However, there were\nvolcanic passions within him that surged up from his toes when, as the\nwind and rain whipped through his scanty coverings, he remembered the\nsnug underskirts Bbulas was wearing beneath his warm gown. They were\nmetal, but they were solid. All the garments visible or potentially\nvisible were of woven metal, because, although there was cloth on the\nplanet, it was not politic for the Earthmen to discover how heavily the\nSnaddrath depended upon imports.\n\nAs the Earthmen reached the temple, Larhgan now appeared to join Bbulas\nat the head of the long flight of stairs that led to it. Although\nSkkiru had seen her in her priestly apparel before, it had not made\nthe emotional impression upon him then that it did now, when, standing\nthere, clad in beauty, dignity and warm clothes, she bade the newcomers\nwelcome in several thousand words not too well chosen for her by\nBbulas--who fancied himself a speech-writer as well as a speech-maker,\nfor there was no end to the man's conceit.\n\nThe difference between her magnificent garments and his own miserable\nrags had their full impact upon Skkiru at this moment. He saw the gulf\nthat had been dug between them and, for the first time in his short\nlife, he felt the tormenting pangs of caste distinction. She looked so\nlovely and so remote.\n\n\"... and so you are most welcome to Snaddra, men of Earth,\" she was\nsaying in her melodious voice. \"Our resources may be small but our\nhearts are large, and what little we have, we offer with humility and\nwith love. We hope that you will enjoy as long and as happy a stay here\nas you did on Nemeth....\"\n\nCyril looked at Raoul, who, however, seemed too absorbed in\ncontemplating Larhgan's apparently universal charms to pay much\nattention to the expression on his companion's face.\n\n\"... and that you will carry our affection back to all the peoples of\nthe Galaxy.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe had finished. And now Cyril cleared his throat. \"Dear friends, we\nwere honored by your gracious invitation to visit this fair planet, and\nwe are honored now by the cordial reception you have given to us.\"\n\nThe crowd yoomped politely. After a slight start, Cyril went on,\napparently deciding that applause was all that had been intended.\n\n\"We feel quite sure that we are going to derive both pleasure and\nprofit from our stay here, and we promise to make our intensive\nanalysis of your culture as painless as possible. We wish only to study\nyour society, not to tamper with it in any way.\"\n\n_Ha, ha_, Skkiru said to himself. _Ha, ha, ha!_\n\n\"But why is it,\" Raoul whispered in Terran as he glanced around out of\nthe corners of his eyes, \"that only the beggar wears mudshoes?\"\n\n\"Shhh,\" Cyril hissed back. \"We'll find out later, when we've\nestablished rapport. Don't be so impatient!\"\n\nBbulas gave a sickly smile. Skkiru could almost find it in his hearts\nto feel sorry for the man.\n\n\"We have prepared our best hut for you, noble sirs,\" Bbulas said with\ngreat self-control, \"and, by happy chance, this very evening a small\nbut unusually interesting ceremony will be held outside the temple. We\nhope you will be able to attend. It is to be a rain dance.\"\n\n\"Rain dance!\" Raoul pulled his macintosh together more tightly at the\nthroat. \"But why do you want rain? My faith, not only does it rain now,\nbut the planet seems to be a veritable sea of mud. Not, of course,\" he\nadded hurriedly as Cyril's reproachful eye caught his, \"that it is not\nattractive mud. Finest mud I have ever seen. Such texture, such color,\nsuch aroma!\"\n\nCyril nodded three times and gave an appreciative sniff.\n\n\"But,\" Raoul went on, \"one can have too much of even such a good thing\nas mud....\"\n\nThe smile did not leave Bbulas' smooth face. \"Yes, of course, honorable\nTerrestrials. That is why we are holding this ceremony. It is not a\ndance to bring on rain. It is a dance to _stop_ rain.\"\n\nHe was pretty quick on the uptake, Skkiru had to concede. However,\nthat was not enough. The man had no genuine organizational ability.\nIn the time he'd had in which to plan and carry out a scheme for\nthe improvement of Snaddra, surely he could have done better than\nthis high-school theocracy. For one thing, he could have apportioned\nthe various roles so that each person would be making a definite\ncontribution to the society, instead of creating some positions plums,\nlike the priesthood, and others prunes, like the beggarship.\n\nWhat kind of life was that for an active, ambitious young man, standing\naround begging? And, moreover, from whom was Skkiru going to beg?\nOnly the Earthmen, for the Snaddrath, no matter how much they threw\nthemselves into the spirit of their roles, could not be so carried\naway that they would give handouts to a young man whom they had been\naccustomed to see basking in the bosom of luxury.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUnfortunately, the fees that he'd received in the past had not enabled\nhim both to live well and to save, and now that his fortunes had been\nso drastically reduced, he seemed in a fair way of starving to death.\nIt gave him a gentle, moody pleasure to envisage his own funeral,\nalthough, at the same time, he realized that Bbulas would probably have\nto arrange some sort of pension for him; he could not expect Skkiru's\npatriotism to extend to abnormal limits. A man might be willing to die\nfor his planet in many ways--but wantonly starving to death as the\nresult of a primitive affectation was hardly one of them.\n\nAll the same, Skkiru reflected as he watched the visitors being led off\nto the native hut prepared for them, how ignominious it would be for\none of the brightest young architects on the planet to have to subsist\nmiserably on the dole just because the world had gone aboveground. The\ncapital had risen to the surface and the other cities would soon follow\nsuit. Meanwhile, a careful system of tabus had been designed to keep\nthe Earthmen from discovering the existence of those other cities.\n\nHe could, of course, emigrate to another part of the planet, to one of\nthem, and stave off his doom for a while--but that would not be playing\nthe game. Besides, in such a case, he wouldn't be able to see Larhgan.\n\nAs if all this weren't bad enough, he had been done an injury which\nstruck directly at his professional pride. He hadn't even been allowed\nto help in planning the huts. Bbulas and some workmen had done all that\nthemselves with the aid of some antique blueprints that had been put\nout centuries before by a Terrestrial magazine and had been acquired\nfrom a rare tape-and-book dealer on Gambrell, for, Skkiru thought, far\ntoo high a price. He could have designed them himself just as badly and\nmuch more cheaply.\n\nIt wasn't that Skkiru didn't understand well enough that Snaddra had\nbeen forced into making such a drastic change in its way of life.\nWhat resources it once possessed had been depleted and--aside from\nminerals--they had never been very extensive to begin with. All\nlife-forms on the planet were on the point of extinction, save fish and\nrice--the only vegetable that would grow on Snaddra, and originally a\nTerran import at that. So food and fiber had to be brought from the\nother planets, at fabulous expense, for Snaddra was not on any of\nthe direct trade routes and was too unattractive to lure the tourist\nbusiness.\n\nSomething definitely had to be done, if it were not to decay\naltogether. And that was where the Planetary Dilettante came in.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe traditional office of Planetary Dilettante was a civil-service\njob, awarded by competitive examination whenever it fell vacant to\nthe person who scored highest in intelligence, character and general\ngloonatz. However, the tests were inadequate when it came to measuring\nsense of proportion, adaptiveness and charm--and there, Skkiru felt,\nwas where the essential flaw lay. After all, no really effective test\nwould have let a person like Bbulas come out on top.\n\nThe winner was sent to Gambrell, the nearest planet with a Terran\nLeague University, to be given a thorough Terran-type education. No\nindividual on Snaddra could afford such schooling, no matter how\ngreat his personal fortune, because the transportation costs were so\nimmense that only a government could afford them. That was the reason\nwhy only one person in each generation could be chosen to go abroad at\nthe planet's expense and acquire enough finish to cover the rest of the\npopulation.\n\nThe Dilettante's official function had always been, in theory, to serve\nthe planet when an emergency came--and this, old Luccar, the former\nPresident, had decided, when he and the Parliament had awakened to the\nfact that Snaddra was falling into ruin, was an emergency. So he had,\nafter considerable soul-searching, called upon Bbulas to plan a method\nof saving Snaddra--and Bbulas, happy to be in the limelight at last,\nhad come up with this program.\n\nIt was not one Skkiru himself would have chosen. It was not one, he\nfelt, that any reasonable person would have chosen. Nevertheless, the\nBbulas Plan had been adopted by a majority vote of the Snaddrath,\nlargely because no one had come up with a feasible alternative and,\nas a patriotic citizen, Skkiru would abide by it. He would accept the\nstatus of beggar; it was his duty to do so. Moreover, as in the case of\nthe planet, there was no choice.\n\nBut all was not necessarily lost, he told himself. Had he not, in his\nanthropological viewings--though Bbulas might have been the only one\nprivileged to go on ethnological field trips to other planets, he was\nnot the only one who could use a library--seen accounts of societies\nwhere beggarhood could be a rewarding and even responsible station in\nlife? There was no reason why, within the framework of the primitive\nsociety Bbulas had created to allure Terran anthropologists, Skkiru\nshould not make something of himself and show that a beggar was worthy\nof the high priestess's hand--which would be entirely in the Terran\nprimitive tradition of romance.\n\n\"Skkiru!\" Bbulas was screaming, as he spun, now that the Terrans were\nout of ear- and eye-shot \"Skkiru, you idiot, listen to me! What are\nthose ridiculous things you are wearing on your silly feet?\"\n\nSkkiru protruded all of his eyes in innocent surprise. \"Just some\nold pontoons I took from a wrecked air-car once. I have a habit of\ncollecting junk and I thought--\"\n\nBbulas twirled madly in the air. \"You are not supposed to think. Leave\nall the thinking to me!\"\n\n\"Yes, Bbulas,\" Skkiru said meekly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe would have put up an argument, but he had bigger plans in mind and\nhe didn't want them impeded in any way.\n\n\"But they seem like an excellent idea,\" Luccar suggested. \"Primitive\nand yet convenient.\"\n\nBbulas slowed down and gulped. After all, in spite of the fact that\nhe was now only chief yam-stealer--being prevented from practicing\nhis profession simply because there were no yams on the planet and no\none was quite certain what they were--Luccar had once been elected\nPresident by a large popular majority. And a large popular majority is\ndecidedly a force to be reckoned with anywhere in the Galaxy.\n\n\"Any deviations arouse comment,\" Bbulas explained tightly.\n\n\"But if we all--\"\n\n\"There would not be enough pontoons to go around, even if we stripped\nall the air-cars.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Luccar said thoughtfully. \"We couldn't make--?\"\n\n\"No time!\" Bbulas snapped. \"All right, Skkiru--get those things off\nyour feet!\"\n\n\"Will do,\" Skkiru agreed. It would be decidedly unwise to put up an\nargument now. So he'd get his feet muddy; it was all part of the higher\ngood.\n\nLater, as soon as the rain-dance rehearsals were under way, he slipped\naway. No part had been assigned to him anyhow, except that of\nonlooker, and he thought he could manage that without practice. He went\ndown to the library, where, since all the attendants were aboveground,\nhe could browse in the stacks to his hearts' content, without having\nto fill out numerous forms and be shoved about like a plagiarist or\nsomething.\n\nIf the Earthmen were interested in really primitive institutions, he\nthought, they should have a look at the city library. The filing system\nwas really medieval. However, the library would, of course, be tabu for\nthem, along with the rest of the city, which was not supposed to exist.\n\nAs far as the Terrans were to know, the group of lumpy stone huts\n(they should, properly speaking, have been wood, but wood was too rare\nand expensive) was the capital of Snaddra. It would be the capital\nof Snaddra for the Snaddrath, too, except during the hours of rest,\nwhen they would be permitted to retire unobtrusively to their cozy\nwell-drained quarters beneath the mud. Life was going to be hard from\nnow on--unless the Bbulas Plan moved faster than Bbulas himself had\nanticipated. And that would never happen without implementation from\nwithout. From without Bbulas, that was.\n\nSkkiru got to work on the tex-tapes and soon decided upon his area of\noperations. Bbulas had concentrated so much effort on the ethos of the\nplanet that he had devoted insufficient detail to the mythos. That,\ntherefore, was the field in which Skkiru felt he must concentrate. And\nconcentrate he did.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe rain dance, which had been elaborately staged by the planet's\nfinest choreographers, came to a smashing climax, after which there was\na handsome display of fireworks.\n\n\"But it is still raining,\" Raoul protested.\n\n\"Did you expect the rain to stop?\" Bbulas asked, his eyes bulging\nwith involuntary surprise. \"I mean--\" he said, hastily retracting\nthem--\"well, it doesn't always stop right away. The gods may not have\nbeen feeling sufficiently propitious.\"\n\n\"Thought you had only one god, old boy,\" Cyril observed, after giving\nhis associate a searching glance. \"Chap by the name of Whipsnade or\nsome such.\"\n\n\"Ipsnadd. He is our chief deity. But we have a whole pantheon. Major\ngods and minor gods. Heroes and demigods and nature spirits--\"\n\n\"And do not forget the prophets,\" Larhgan put in helpfully. As former\nChief Beauty of the planet (an elective civil-service office), she was\nnot accustomed to being left out of things. \"We have many prophets. And\nsaints. I myself am studying to be a--\"\n\nBbulas glared at her. Though her antennae quivered sulkily, she stopped\nand said no more--for the moment, anyway.\n\n\"Sounds like quite a complex civilization,\" Cyril commented.\n\n\"No, no!\" Bbulas protested in alarm. \"We are a simple primitive people\nwithout technological pretensions.\"\n\n\"You don't need any,\" Cyril assured him. \"Not when you have fireworks\nthat function in the rain.\"\n\nInside himself, Skkiru guffawed.\n\n\"We are a simple people,\" Bbulas repeated helplessly. \"A very simple\nand very primitive people.\"\n\n\"Somehow,\" Raoul said, \"I feel you may have a quality that civilization\nmay have lost.\" The light in his eyes was recognizable to any even\nremotely humanoid species as a mystic glow.\n\nBut Cyril seemed well in command of the situation. \"Come now, Raoul,\"\nhe laughed, clapping his young colleague on the shoulder, \"don't fall\ninto the Rousseau trap--noble savage and all that sort of rot!\"\n\n\"But that beggar!\" Raoul insisted. \"Trite, certainly, but incredible\nnonetheless! Before, one only read of such things--\"\n\nA glazed look came into two of Bbulas' eyes, while the third closed\ndespairingly. \"What beggar? What beggar? Tell me--I must know ... as if\nI didn't really,\" he muttered in Snaddrath.\n\n\"The only beggar we've seen on this planet so far. That one.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith a wave of his hand, Cyril indicated the modest form of Skkiru,\nattempting to conceal himself behind Luccar's portly person.\n\n\"I realize it was only illusion, but, as my associate says, a\nremarkably good one. And,\" Cyril added, \"an even more remarkable\nexample of cultural diffusion.\"\n\n\"What do you mean? Please, gracious and lovable Terrans, deign to tell\nme what you mean. What did that insufferable beggar do?\"\n\nIn spite of himself, Skkiru's knees flickered. _Fool_, he told himself,\n_you knew it was bound to come out sooner or later. Take courage in\nyour own convictions; be convinced by your own courage. All he really\ncan do is yell._\n\n\"He did the Indian rope trick for us,\" Raoul explained. \"And very well,\ntoo. Very well indeed.\"\n\n\"The--Indian rope trick!\" Bbulas spluttered. \"Why, the--\" And then he\nrecollected his religious vocation, as well as his supposed ignorance.\n\"Would you be so kind as to tell me what the Indian rope trick is, good\nsirs?\"\n\n\"Well, he did it with a chain, actually.\"\n\n\"We have no ropes on this planet,\" Larhgan contributed. \"We are\nbackward.\"\n\n\"And a small boy went up and disappeared,\" Raoul finished.\n\nSuddenly forgetting the stiff-upper-lip training for which the planet\nhad gone to such great expense, Bbulas spun around and around in a\nfit of bad temper, to Skkiru's great glee. Fortunately, the Dilettante\nretained enough self-control to keep his feet on the ground--perhaps\nremembering that to fail to do so would compound Skkiru's crime.\n\n\"Dervishism!\" Raoul exclaimed, his eyes incandescent with interest. He\npulled out his notebook. After biting his lip thoughtfully, Cyril did\nthe same.\n\n\"Just like Skkiru!\" Bbulas gasped as he spun slowly to a stop. \"He is a\ndisruptive cultural mechanism. Leading children astray!\"\n\n\"But not at all,\" Raoul pointed out politely. \"The boy came back\nunharmed and in the best of spirits.\"\n\n\"So far as we could see,\" Cyril amended. \"Of course there may have been\npsychic damage.\"\n\n\"Which boy was it?\" Bbulas demanded.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCyril pointed to the urchin in question--a rather well-known juvenile\ndelinquent, though the Terrestrials, of course, couldn't know that.\n\n\"He is a member of my own clan,\" Bbulas said. \"He will be thrashed\nsoundly.\"\n\n\"But why punish him?\" Raoul asked. \"What harm has he done?\"\n\n\"Shhh,\" Cyril warned him. \"You may be touching on a tabu. What's the\nmatter with you, anyway? One would think you had forgotten every lesson\nyou ever learned.\"\n\n\"Oh, I am truly sorry!\" Raoul's face became a pleasing shade of pink,\nwhich made him look much more human. Maybe it was the wrong color, but\nat least it was a color. \"Please to accept my apologies, reverend sir.\"\n\n\"It's quite all right.\" Bbulas reverted to graciousness. \"The boy\nshould not have associated with a beggar--especially that one. If he\ndid not hold his post by time-hallowed tradition, we would--dispose of\nhim. He has always been a trouble-maker.\"\n\n\"But I do not understand,\" Raoul persisted. Skkiru could not understand\nwhy Cyril did not stop him again. \"The beggar did the trick very\neffectively. I know it was all illusion, but I should like to know just\nhow he created such an illusion, and, moreover, how the Indian rope\ntrick got all the way to--\"\n\n\"It was all done by magic,\" Bbulas said firmly. \"Magic outside the\ntemple is not encouraged, because it is black magic, and so it is\nwrong. The magic of the priests is white magic, and so it is right. Put\nthat down in your little book.\"\n\nRaoul obediently wrote it down. \"Still, I should like to know--\"\n\n\"Let us speak of pleasanter things,\" Bbulas interrupted again.\n\"Tomorrow night, we are holding a potlatch and we should be honored to\nhave the pleasure of your company.\"\n\n\"Delighted,\" Raoul bowed.\n\n\"I was wrong,\" Cyril said. \"This is not a remarkable example of\ncultural diffusion. It is a remarkable example of a diffuse culture.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"But I cannot understand,\" Raoul said to Cyril later, in the imagined\nprivacy of their hut. \"Why are you suspicious of this charming,\nfriendly people, so like the natives that the textbooks lead one to\nexpect?\"\n\n_Naturally_, Skkiru--having made his way in through a secret passage\nknown only to the entire population of the city and explicitly designed\nfor espionage, and was spying outside the door--thought, _we are\ntextbook natives. Not only because we were patterned on literary\nprototypes, but because Bbulas never really left school--in spirit,\nanyway. He is the perpetual undergraduate and his whole scheme is\nnothing more than a grandiose Class Night._\n\n\"Precisely what I've been thinking,\" Cyril said. \"So like the\ntextbooks--all the textbooks put together.\"\n\n\"What do you mean? Surely it is possible for analogous cultural\nfeatures to develop independently in different cultures?\"\n\n\"Oh, it's possible, all right. Probability--particularly when it comes\nto such a great number of features packed into one small culture--is\nanother matter entirely.\"\n\n\"I cannot understand you,\" Raoul objected. \"What do you want of these\npoor natives? To me, it seems everything has been of the most idyllic.\nRapport was established almost immediately.\"\n\n\"A little too immediately, perhaps, don't you think? You haven't had\nmuch experience, Raoul, so you might not be aware it usually isn't as\neasy as this.\"\n\nCyril flung himself down on one of the cots that had been especially\nhardened for Terrestrial use and blew smoke rings at the ceiling.\nSkkiru was dying for a cigarette himself, but that was another cultural\nfeature the Snaddrath had to dispense with now--not that smoking was\ninsufficiently primitive, but that tobacco was not indigenous to the\nplanet.\n\n\"That is because they are not a hostile people,\" Raoul insisted.\n\"Apparently they have no enemies. Nonetheless, they are of the utmost\ninterest. I hardly expected to land a society like this on my very\nfirst field trip,\" he added joyfully. \"Never have I heard of so dynamic\na culture! Never!\"\n\n\"Nor I,\" Cyril agreed, \"and this is far from being my very first\nfield trip. It has a terribly large number of strange elements in\nit--strange, that is, when considered in relationship to the society\nas a whole. Environmental pressures seem to have had no effect upon\ntheir culture. For instance, don't you think it rather remarkable that\na people with such an enormously complex social structure as theirs\nshould wear clothing so ill adapted to protect them from the weather?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Well,\" Raoul pointed out enthusiastically--another undergraduate type,\nSkkiru observed, happiest with matters that either resembled those in\nbooks or came directly from them, so that they could be explicitly\npigeonholed--\"the Indians of Tierra del Fuego wore nothing but\nwaist-length sealskin capes even in the bitterest cold. Of course, this\ncivilization is somewhat more advanced than theirs in certain ways, but\none finds such anomalies in all primitive civilizations, does one not?\"\n\n\"That's true to a certain extent. But one would think they'd at least\nhave developed boots to cope with the mud. And why was the beggar the\nonly one to wear mudshoes? Why, moreover--\" Cyril narrowed his eyes and\npointed his cigarette at Raoul--\"did he wear them only the first time\nand subsequently appear barefooted?\"\n\n\"That _was_ odd,\" Raoul admitted, \"but--\"\n\n\"And the high priest spoke of thrashing that boy. You should know, old\nchap, that cruelty to children is in inverse ratio to the degree of\ncivilization.\"\n\nRaoul stared at his colleague. \"My faith, are you suggesting that we go\nsee how hard they hit him, then?\"\n\nCyril laughed. \"All I suggest is that we keep a very open mind about\nthis society until we can discover what fundamental attitudes are\ncontrolling such curious individual as well as group behavior.\"\n\n\"But assuredly. That is what we are here for, is it not? So why are you\ndisturbing yourself so much?\"\n\nBut it was Raoul, Skkiru thought, who appeared much more disturbed\nthan Cyril. It was understandable--the younger man was interested only\nin straightforward ethnologizing and undoubtedly found the developing\ncomplications upsetting.\n\n\"Look,\" Cyril continued. \"They call this place a hut. It's almost a\npalace.\"\n\n_My God_, Skkiru thought, _what kind of primitive conditions are they\nused to?_\n\n\"That is largely a question of semantics,\" Raoul protested. \"But\nregard--the roof leaks. Is that not backward enough for you, eh?\" And\nRaoul moved to another part of the room to avoid receiving indisputable\nproof of the leakage on his person. \"What is more, the sanitary\narrangements are undeniably primitive.\"\n\n\"The roofs of many palaces leak, and there is no plumbing to speak of,\nand still they are not called huts. And tell me this--why should the\nmetal-workers be the pariahs? Why _metal-workers_?\"\n\nRaoul's eyes opened wide. \"You know there is often an outcast class\nwith no apparent rationale behind its establishment. All the tapes--\"\n\n\"True enough, but you will remember that the reason the smiths of\nMasai were pariahs was that they manufactured weapons which might tempt\npeople to commit bloodshed. I keep remembering them, somehow. I keep\nremembering so many things here....\"\n\n\"But we have seen no weapons on this planet,\" Raoul argued. \"In fact,\nthe people seem completely peaceful.\"\n\n\"Right you are.\" Cyril blew another smoke ring. \"Since this is a planet\ndependent chiefly upon minerals, why make the members of its most\nimportant industry the out-group?\"\n\n\"You think it is that they may be secretly hostile?\"\n\nCyril smiled. \"I think they may be secretly something, but hardly\nhostile.\"\n\n_Aha_, Skkiru thought. _Bbulas, my splendidly scaled friend, I will\nhave something interesting to tell you._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You idiot!\" Bbulas snarled later that night, as most of the Snaddrath\nmet informally in the council chamber belowground, the new caste\ndistinctions being, if not forgotten, at least in abeyance--for\neveryone except Bbulas. \"You imbecile!\" He whirled, unable to repress\nhis Snadd emotions after a long behaviorally Terran day. \"I have half a\nmind to get rid of you by calling down divine judgment.\"\n\n\"How would you do that?\" Skkiru demanded, emboldened by the little cry\nof dismay, accompanied by a semi-somersault, which Larhgan gave. In\nspite of everything, she still loved him; she would never belong to\nBbulas, though he might plan until he was ochre in the face.\n\n\"Same way you did the rope trick. Only you wouldn't come back, my\nboy. Nice little cultural trait for the ethnologists to put in their\npeace pipes and smoke. Never saw such people for asking awkward\nquestions.\" Bbulas sighed and straightened his antennae with his\nfingers, since their ornaments made them too heavy to allow reflective\nverticalization. \"Reminds me of final exams back on Gambrell.\"\n\n\"Anthropologists _always_ ask awkward questions--everybody knows that,\"\nLarhgan put in. \"It's their function. And I don't think you should\nspeak that way to Skkiru, Bbulas. Like all of us, he's only trying to\ndo his best. No man--or woman--can do more.\"\n\nShe smiled at Skkiru and his hearts whirled madly inside him. Only a\ndolt, he thought, would give way to despair; there was no need for this\nintolerable situation to endure for a lifetime. If only he could solve\nthe problem more quickly than Bbulas expected or--Skkiru began to\nunderstand--wanted, Larhgan could be his again.\n\n\"With everybody trying to run this planet,\" Bbulas snarled, taking off\nhis headdress, \"no wonder things are going wrong.\"\n\nLuccar intervened. Although it was obvious that he had been enjoying\nto a certain extent the happy anonymity of functionless yam-stealer,\nold elective responsibilities could not but hang heavy over a public\nservant of such unimpeachable integrity.\n\n\"After all,\" the old man said, \"secretly we're still a democracy, and\nsecretly I am still President, and secretly I'm beginning to wonder if\nperhaps we weren't a little rash in--\"\n\n\"Look here, all of you,\" Bbulas interrupted querulously. \"I'm not doing\nthis for my own amusement.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_But that's just what you are doing_, Skkiru thought, _even though you\nwouldn't admit it to yourself, nor would you think of it as amusement._\n\n\"You know what happened to Nemeth,\" Bbulas continued, using an argument\nthat had convinced them before, but that was beginning to wear a little\nthin now. \"Poorest, most backward planet in the whole Galaxy. A couple\nof ethnologists from Earth stumbled on it a little over a century ago\nand what happened? More kept on coming; the trade ships followed. Now\nit's the richest, most advanced planet in that whole sector. There's no\nreason why the same thing can't happen to us in this sector, if we play\nour cards carefully.\"\n\n\"But maybe these two won't tell other anthropologists about us,\" Luccar\nsaid. \"Something the older one remarked certainly seemed to imply as\nmuch. Maybe they don't want the same thing to happen again--in which\ncase, all this is a waste of time. Furthermore,\" he concluded rather\npetulantly, \"at my age, I don't like running about in the open; it's\nnot healthful.\"\n\n\"If they don't tell other anthropologists about us,\" Bbulas said,\nhis face paling to lime-green with anxiety, \"we can spread the news\nunobtrusively ourselves. Just let one study be published, even under\nfalse coordinates, and we can always hire a good public relations man\nto let our whereabouts leak out. Please, everybody, stick to your\nappointed tasks and let me do the worrying. You haven't even given this\nculture a chance! It's hardly more than a day old and all I hear are\ncomplaints, complaints, complaints.\"\n\n\"You'd better worry,\" Skkiru said smugly, \"because already those\nTerrans think there's something fishy about this culture. Ha, ha! Did\nyou get that--fishy?\"\n\nOnly Larhgan laughed. She loved him.\n\n\"How do you know they're suspicious?\" Bbulas demanded. \"Are you in\ntheir confidence? Skkiru, if you've been talking--\"\n\n\"All I did was spy outside their door,\" Skkiru said hastily. \"I knew\n_you_ couldn't eavesdrop; it wouldn't look dignified if you were\ncaught. But beggars do that kind of thing all the time. And I wanted to\nshow you I could be of real use.\"\n\nHe beamed at Larhgan, who beamed back.\n\n\"I could have kept my findings to myself,\" he went on, \"but I came to\ntell you. In fact--\" he dug in his robe--\"I even jotted down a few\nnotes.\"\n\n\"It wasn't at all necessary, Skkiru,\" Bbulas said in a tired voice.\n\"We took the elementary precaution of wiring their hut for sound and a\nrecorder is constantly taking down their every word.\"\n\n\"Hut!\" Skkiru kept his antennae under control with an effort, but his\nretort was feeble. \"They think it's a palace. You did them too well,\nBbulas.\"\n\n\"I may have overdone the exterior architecture a bit,\" the high priest\nadmitted. \"Not that it seems relevant to the discussion. Although I've\nbeen trying to arrange our primitivism according to Terrestrial ideas\nof cultural backwardness, I'm afraid many of the physical arrangements\nare primitive according to our conceptions rather than theirs.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Why _must_ we be primitive according to Terran ideas?\" Luccar wanted\nto know. \"Why must we be slaves even to fashions in backwardness?\"\n\n\"Hear, hear!\" cried an anonymous voice.\n\n\"And thank you, Skkiru,\" the former President continued, \"for telling\nme they were suspicious. I doubt that Bbulas would have taken the\ntrouble to inform me of so trivial a matter.\"\n\n\"As high priest,\" Bbulas said stiffly, \"I believe the matter, trivial\nor not, now falls within my province.\"\n\n\"Shame!\" cried an anonymous voice--or it might have been the same one.\n\nBbulas turned forest-green and his antennae twitched. \"After all, you\nyourself, Luccar, agreed to accept the role of elder statesman--\"\n\n\"Yam-stealer,\" Luccar corrected him bitterly, \"which is not the same\nthing.\"\n\n\"On Earth, it is. And,\" Bbulas went on quickly, \"as for our assuming\nprimitive Earth attitudes, where else are we going to get our attitudes\nfrom? We can't borrow any primitive attitudes from Nemeth, because\nthey're too well known. And since there are no other planets we know\nof with intelligent life-forms that have social structures markedly\ndifferent from the major Terran ones--except for some completely\nnon-humanoid cultures, which, for physiological reasons, we are\nincapable of imitating--we have to rely upon records of primitive\nTerran sources for information. Besides, a certain familiarity with\nthe traits manifested will make the culture more understandable to\nthe Terrans, and, hence, more attractive to them psychologically.\" He\nstopped and straightened out his antennae.\n\n\"In other words,\" Skkiru commented, emboldened by a certain aura of\nsympathy he felt emanating from Larhgan, at least, and probably from\nLuccar, too, \"he doesn't have the imagination to think up any cultural\ntraits for himself, so he has to steal them--and that's the easiest\nplace to steal them from.\"\n\n\"This is none of your business, Skkiru,\" Bbulas snapped. \"You just beg.\"\n\n\"It's the business of all of us, Bbulas,\" Luccar corrected softly.\n\"Please to remember that, no matter what our alloted roles, we are all\nconcerned equally in this.\"\n\n\"Of course, of course, but please let me handle the situation in my own\nway, since I made the plans. And, Skkiru,\" the Dilettante added with\nstrained grace, \"you may have a warm cloak to wear as soon as we can\nget patches welded on.\"\n\nThen Bbulas took a deep breath and reverted to his old cheer-leader\nmanner. \"Now we must all get organized for the potlatch. We can give\nthe Terrans those things the Ladies' Aid has been working on all year\nfor the charity bazaar and, in exchange, perhaps they will give us more\nchocolate bars--\" he glanced reproachfully at Skkiru--\"and other food.\"\n\n\"And perhaps some yams,\" Luccar suggested, \"so that--God save us--I can\nsteal them.\"\n\n\"I'll definitely work on that,\" Bbulas promised.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSkkiru was glad that, as beggar, he held no prominent position at the\nfeast--in reality, no position at all--for he hated fish. And fish,\nnaturally, would be the chief refreshment offered, since the Snaddrath\ndid not want the Terrans to know that they had already achieved that\ndegrading dependency upon the tin can that marks one of the primary\ndifferences between savagery and civilization.\n\nThere were fish p\u00e2t\u00e9 on rice crackers, fish soup with rice, boiled\nfish, baked fish, fried fish and a pilau of rice with fish. There were\nfish chitlins, fish chips, fish cakes, fish candy and guslat--a potent\ndistillation of fermented fish livers--to wash it all down. And even\nin the library, where Skkiru sought refuge from the festivities, fishy\nfumes kept filtering down through the ventilating system to assail his\nnostrils.\n\nBbulas had been right in a way, Skkiru had to admit to himself upon\nreflection. In trying to improve his lot, Skkiru had taken advantage of\nthe Snaddrath's special kinetic talents, which had been banned for the\nduration--and so he had, in effect, committed a crime.\n\nThis time, however, he would seek to uplift himself in terms acceptable\nto the Terrans on a wholly indigenous level, and in terms which\nwould also hasten the desired corruptive process--in a nice way,\nof course--so that the Snaddrath civilization could be profitably\nundermined as fast as possible and Larhgan be his once again. It was a\nhard problem to solve, but he felt sure he could do it. Anything Bbulas\ncould do, he could do better.\n\nThen he had it! And the idea was so wonderful that he was a little\nsorry at the limited range it would necessarily cover. His part really\nshould be played out before a large, yoomping audience, but he was\nrealistic enough to see that it would be most expedient for him to give\na private performance for the Earthmen alone.\n\nOn the other hand, he now knew it should be offered outside the hut,\nbecause the recorder would pick up his cries and Bbulas would be in a\nspin--as he would be about any evidence of independent thinking on the\nplanet. Bbulas was less interested in the planet's prospering, it was\nnow clear to Skkiru, than in its continuing in a state where he would\nremain top fish.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFortunately, the guslat had done its work, and by the time the Earthmen\narrived at the door to their hut, they were alone. The rest of the\ncompany either had fallen into a stupor or could not trust themselves\nto navigate the mud.\n\nThe Earthmen--with an ingeniousness which would have augured well for\nthe future development of their race, had it not already been the\n(allegedly) most advanced species in the Galaxy--had adapted some spare\nparts from their ship into replicas of Skkiru's mudshoes. They did,\nin truth, seem none too steady on their feet, but he was unable to\ndetermine to what degree this was a question of intoxication and what\ndegree a question of navigation.\n\n\"Alms, for the love of Ipsnadd.\" He thrust forward his begging bowl.\n\n\"Regard, it is the beggar! Why were you not at the festivities, worthy\nmendicant?\" Raoul hiccuped. \"Lovely party. Beautiful women. Delicious\nfish.\"\n\nSkkiru started to stand on his head, then remembered this was no longer\na socially acceptable expression of grief and cast his eyes down. \"I\nwas not invited,\" he said sadly.\n\n\"Like the little match girl,\" Raoul sympathized. \"My heart bleeds for\nyou, good match gi--good beggar. Does your heart not bleed for him,\nCyril?\"\n\n\"Bad show,\" the older ethnologist agreed, with a faint smile. \"But\nthat's what you've got to expect, if you're going to be a primitive.\"\n\nHe was very drunk, Skkiru decided; he must be, to phrase his sentiments\nso poorly. Unless he--but no, Skkiru refused to believe that. He didn't\nmind Cyril's being vaguely suspicious, but that was as far as he wanted\nhim to go. Skkiru's toes apprehensively started to quiver.\n\n\"How can you say a thing like that to a primitive?\" Raoul demanded. \"If\nhe were not a primitive, it would be all right to call him a primitive,\nbut one does not accuse primitives of being primitives. It's--it's\ndownright primitive; that's what it is!\"\n\n\"You need some coffee, my boy.\" Cyril grinned. \"Black coffee. That\nguslat of theirs is highly potent stuff.\"\n\nThey were about to go inside. Skkiru had to act quickly. He slumped\nover. Although he had meant to land on the doorstep, he lacked the\nagility to balance himself with the precision required and so he fell\nsmack into the mud. The feel of the slime on his bare feet had been bad\nenough; oozing over his skin through the interstices of his clothing,\nit was pure hell. What sacrifices he was making for his planet! And\nfor Larhgan. The thought of her would have to sustain him through this\nviscous ordeal, for there was nothing else solid within his grasp.\n\n\"Ubbl,\" he said, lifting his head from the ooze, so that they could see\nthe froth coming out of his mouth. \"Glubbl.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRaoul clutched Cyril. \"What is he doing?\"\n\n\"Having an epileptic fit, I rather fancy. Go on, old man,\" Cyril said\nto Skkiru. \"You're doing splendidly. Splendidly!\"\n\n\"I see the sky!\" Skkiru howled, anxious to get his prophecies over with\nbefore he sank any deeper in the mud. \"It is great magic. I see many\nships in the sky. They are all coming to Snaddra....\"\n\n\"Bearing anthropologists and chocolate bars, I suppose,\" murmured\nCyril.\n\n\"Shhh,\" Raoul said indignantly. \"You must not interrupt. He is having\npersonal contact with the supernatural, a very important element of the\nprimitive ethos.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" Cyril said. \"I'll try to remember that.\"\n\n_So will I_, thought Skkiru. \"They carry learned men and food for the\nspiritually and physically hungry people of Snaddra,\" he interrupted\nimpatiently. \"They carry warm clothing for the poor and miserable\npeople of Snaddra. They carry yams for the larcenous and frustrated\npeople of Snaddra.\"\n\n\"Yams!\" Raoul echoed. \"_Yams!_\"\n\n\"Shhh, this is fascinating. Go on, beggar.\"\n\nBut the mud sogging over Skkiru's body was too much. The fit could be\ncontinued at a later date--and in a drier location.\n\n\"Where am I?\" he asked, struggling to a sitting position.\n\n\"You are on Snaddra, fifth planet of the sun Weebl,\" Raoul began, \"in--\"\n\n\"Weeeeebl,\" Skkiru corrected, getting to his feet with the older\nethnologist's assistance. \"What happened?\" He beat futilely at the mud\ncaught in the meshes of his metal rags. \"I feel faint.\"\n\n\"Come in and have some coffee with us,\" Cyril invited. This also was\npart of Skkiru's plan, for he had no intention of going back across\nthat mud, if he could possibly help it. He had nothing further\nto say that the recorders should not hear. Bbulas might object to\nhis associating with the Earthmen, but he couldn't do much if the\nassociation seemed entirely innocent. At the moment, Snaddra might be a\ntheocracy, but the democratic hangover was still strong.\n\n\"I would rather have some hot chocolate,\" Skkiru said. \"That is, if you\nhave no objection to drinking with a beggar.\"\n\n\"My dear fellow--\" Cyril put an arm around Skkiru's muddy\nshoulders--\"we ethnologists do not hold with caste distinctions. Come\nin and have chocolate--with a spot of rum, eh? That'll make you right\nas a trivet in a matter of seconds.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt wasn't until much later, after several cups of the finest chocolate\nhe had ever tasted, that Skkiru announced himself to feel quite\nrecovered.\n\n\"Please do not bother to accompany me to the door,\" he said. \"I can\nfind my own way. You do me too much honor. I would feel shamefaced.\"\n\n\"But--\" Cyril began.\n\n\"No,\" Skkiru said. \"It is--it is bad form here. I insist. I must go my\nway alone.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Cyril agreed.\n\nRaoul looked at him in some surprise.\n\n\"All right,\" Cyril repeated in a louder tone. \"Go by yourself, if an\nescort would bother you. But please give the door a good bang, so the\nlock will catch.\"\n\nSkkiru slammed the door lustily to simulate the effect of departure\nand then he descended via the secret passage inside the hut itself,\nscrabbling a little because the hot chocolate seemed strangely to have\naffected his sense of balance.\n\nThe rest of the Snaddrath were in the council chamber gloating over the\nloot from the potlatch. It was, as a matter of fact, a good take.\n\n\"Where were you, Skkiru?\" Bbulas asked, examining a jar of preserved\nkumquats suspiciously. \"Up to no good, I'll be bound.\"\n\n\"Oh, my poor Skkiru!\" Larhgan exclaimed, before Skkiru could say\nanything. \"How muddy and wretched-looking you are! I don't like this\nwhole thing,\" she told Bbulas. \"It's cruel. Being high priestess isn't\nnearly as much fun as I thought it would be.\"\n\n\"This is not supposed to be fun,\" the Dilettante informed her coldly.\n\"It is in dead earnest. Since the question has been brought up,\nhowever, what did happen to you, Skkiru?\"\n\n\"I--er--fell down and, being a beggar, I had no other garments to\nchange into.\"\n\n\"You'll survive,\" Bbulas said unfeelingly. \"On Earth, I understand,\npeople fall into mud all the time. Supposed to have a beneficial\neffect--and any effect on you, Skkiru, would have to be beneficial.\"\n\nLarhgan was opening her mouth to say something--probably, Skkiru\nthought fondly, in his defense--when there came a thud and a yell from\nthe passage outside. Two yells, in fact. And two thuds.\n\n\"My faith,\" exclaimed a Terrestrial voice, \"but how did the beggar\ndescend! I am sure every bone in my body is broken.\"\n\n\"I think you'll find him possessed of means of locomotion not known to\nus. But you're not hurt, old chap--only bruised.\"\n\nAnd Cyril came into the council chamber, followed by a limping Raoul.\n\"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I trust this is not an intrusion,\nalthough I'm quite sure you'll tell us we've broken a whole slue of\ntabus.\"\n\n\"You!\" Bbulas screamed at Skkiru. \"You must have used the passage in\nthe hut! You let them follow you!\"\n\nLosing control of his own reflexes, he began to whirl madly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"But regard this!\" Raoul exclaimed, staring around him. \"To build a\nplace like this beneath the mud--name of a name, these people must\nhave hydraulic engineering far superior to anything on Earth!\"\n\n\"You are too kind,\" the former hydraulic engineer said deprecatingly.\n\"Actually, it's quite simple--\"\n\n\"This is not a primitive civilization at all, Raoul,\" Cyril explained.\n\"They've been faking it from tapes. Probably have a culture very much\nlike ours, with allowances for climatic differences, of course. Oh,\nundoubtedly it would be provincial, but--\"\n\n\"We are not provincial,\" Larhgan said coldly. \"Primitive, yes.\nProvincial, no! We are--\"\n\n\"But why should they do a thing like this to us?\" Raoul wailed.\n\n\"I imagine they did it to get on the trade routes, as Nemeth did.\nThey've been trying not to talk about Nemeth all the while. Must have\nbeen rather a strain. You ought to be ashamed of yourselves!\" Cyril\ntold the assembled Snaddrath. \"Very bad form!\"\n\nBbulas was turning paler and paler as he whirled. \"All your fault,\" he\ngasped hoarsely to Skkiru. \"All your fault!\"\n\nAnd that was true, Skkiru realized. His antennae quivered, but he\ndidn't even try to restrain them. He had meant well, yet he had messed\nup the planet's affairs far more seriously than Bbulas had. He had\nruined their hopes, killed all their chances by his carelessness.\nHe, Skkiru, instead of being his planet's savior, was its spoiler. He\npsonked violently.\n\nBut Larhgan moved nearer to him. \"It's all over, anyhow,\" she whispered,\n\"and you know what? I'm glad. I'm glad we failed. I'd rather starve as\nmyself than succeed as a sham.\"\n\nSkkiru controlled himself. Silently, he took the grimpatch out of his\ncarrier and, as silently, she took it back.\n\n\"My faith, they must have had plumbing all the time!\" Raoul complained.\n\n\"Very likely,\" said Cyril sternly. \"Looks as if we've suffered for\nnothing.\"\n\n\"Such people!\" Raoul said. \"True primitives, I am sure, would never\nhave behaved so unfeelingly!\"\n\nCyril smiled, but his face was hard as he turned back to the Snaddrath.\n\"We'll radio Gambrell in the morning to have a ship dispatched to pick\nus up. I'm not sure but that we have a good case for fraud against you.\"\n\n\"We're destroyed!\" Bbulas shrieked as the full emotional impact of\nthe situation hit him. \"An interplanetary lawsuit would ruin Snaddra\nentirely.\"\n\nHis cries were echoed in the howls of the other Snaddrath, their\nantennae psonking, their eyes bulging.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAgonized by his sorrow, Bbulas lost all emotional restraint, forgot\nabout his Terrestrial training, and turned upside down in a spasm of\ngrief. Since there was no longer any reason to repress their natural\nmanifestation of feeling, all the Snaddrath followed suit, their\nantennae twisting in frenzy as they ululated.\n\nAnd then, to Skkiru's surprise and the surprise of all the rest, Cyril\nstopped and took out his notebook. \"Wait a minute,\" he said as Raoul\ndid likewise. All four Earthly eyes were shining with a glow that was\nrecognizable to any even remotely humanoid species as the glow of\nintellectual fervor. \"Wait just a minute! Our plans are altered. We may\nstay, after all!\"\n\nOne by one, the Snaddrath reversed to upright positions, but did not\nretract their eyes, for they were still staring at the Earthmen. Skkiru\nknew now what had been bothering him about the Terrestrials all along.\nThey were crazy--that was what it was. Who but maniacs would want to\nleave their warm, dry planets and go searching the stars for strange\ncultures, when they could stay quietly at home in peace and comfort\nwith their families?\n\nSkkiru's hand reached out for Larhgan's and found it.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Ignoble Savages, by Evelyn E.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
