F. P., strikes at the insidious\ninterests that are lashing high the war feeling between Earth and\nMars.]\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n_Strange Intruder_\n\n\nSime Hemingway did not sleep well his first night on Mars. There was\nno tangible reason why he shouldn't. His bed was soft. He had dined\nsumptuously, for this hotel's cuisine offered not only Martian\ndelicacies, but drew on Earth and Venus as well.\n\nYet Sime did not sleep well. He tossed restlessly in the caressing\nsoftness of his bed. He turned a knob in the head panel of his bed,\ntried to yield to the soothing music that seemed to come from nowhere.\nHe turned another knob, watched the marching, playing, whirling of\nsomnolent colors on the domed ceiling of his room.\n\nAt last he gave it up. Some sixth sense had him all jumpy. It was not\nusual for Sime Hemingway to be jumpy. He was one of the coolest heads\nin the I. F. P., the Interplanetary Flying Police who patrolled the\nlonely reaches of space and brought man's law to the outermost orbit\nof the far-flung solar system.\n\nNow he jumped out of bed and examined the fastening of his door, the\ndoor to the hotel corridor. There was only one, and it was secure.\nWindows there were none, and investigation showed that the small ports\nwere all covered with their pivoted safety plates. He extinguished the\nlight, swung aside one of the plates, and peered out into the Martian\nnight. It was moonlight--both Deimos and Phobos were racing across the\nblue-black sky. The waters of Crystal Canal stretched out before him,\nseemingly illimitable. Sime knew that the distance to the other side\nwas twenty miles or more. Clear-cut through the thin atmosphere of\nMars, he could see the jeweled lights of South Tarog, on the other\nside.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe hotel grounds, too, were well lighted. Long, luminous tubes, part\nof the architecture of the buildings, aided the moons, shedding their\nserene glow on the gentle slope of the red lawns and terraces, the\ngeometrically trimmed shrubs and trees. They were reflected warmly in\nthe dancing waves of the canal, though Sime knew that even in this,\nthe height of the summer season, the outside temperature was very near\nfreezing.\n\nNow a hotel guard came along. He carried at his belt a neuro-pistol, a\ndeadly weapon whose beam would destroy the nervous structure of any\nliving creature. He went past the port with measured stride, and Sime\nslid back the safety plate with a puzzled frown.\n\nWhy was he so nervous? This wasn't the first dangerous mission on\nwhich he had embarked in the course of his official duty. And danger\nwas the element that gave zest to his life.\n\n[Illustration: Clinging like leeches to the wall, the two men resisted\nthe warped gravitational drag.]\n\nHe began a methodical examination of his room, peering under the bed,\ninto closets, a wardrobe. Yet there was no sign of danger. Carefully\nhe inspected his bed for signs of the deadly black mold from Venus\nthat would, once it found lodgment in the pores of a man's skin,\ninexorably invade his body and in the space of a few hours reduce him\nto a black, repulsive parody of humanity. But the sheets were\nunsullied.\n\nThen his gaze fell on the mist-bath. Travelers who have visited Mars\nare, of course, familiar with this simple device, used to overcome to\nsome extent the exceeding dryness of the red planet's atmosphere.\nResembling the steam bath of the ancients, there was just enough room\nin the cylindrical case for a man to sit inside while his skin was\nsprayed with vivifying moisture. But his head would project, and there\nwas no head visible.\n\nNevertheless, so strong was Sime's intuition, he leveled his\nneuro-pistol at the cabinet and approached. With a sweep of his\nmuscular arm he swung it open--and gasped!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe sight that greeted him was enough to make any man gasp, even one\nless young and impressionable than Sime. In all of his twenty-five\nyears he had not seen a woman so lovely. Her complexion was the\ndelicate coral pink of the Martian colonials--descendants of the\noriginal human settlers who had struggled with, and at last bent to\ntheir will, this harsh and inhospitable planet. She was little over\nfive feet tall, although the average Martian is perhaps slightly\nbigger than his terrestrial cousin. Her hair was dark, like that of\nmost Martians, drawn back from her forehead and fastened at the nape\nof her neck, from there to fall in an abundant, rippling cascade down\nher slim, straight back. Her figure was like those delicate and\nancient creations of Dresden china to be seen in museums, but\nelastic, and full of strength. She was dressed in the two-piece\ngarment universally worn by both sexes on Mars--a garment, so\nhistorians say, that was called \"pyjamas\" by our forebears.\n\nAnd she was defiant. In her hand was a stiletto with long, slim blade.\nSime made a darting grasp for her wrist and wrung the weapon from her.\nIt fell to the metal floor with a tinkling clatter.\n\n\"And now tell me, young lady, what's the meaning of this?\"\n\nSuddenly she smiled.\n\n\"I came to warn you, Sime Hemingway.\" She spoke softly and sweetly,\nand with effortless dignity.\n\n\"You came to warn me?\"\n\n\"You are in grave danger. Your mission here is known, and powerful\nenemies are preparing to destroy you.\"\n\n\"You talk like you knew something, kid,\" Sime admitted. \"What is my\nmission here?\"\n\n\"You have been sent to Mars by the I. F. P. in the guise of a mining\nengineer. You are to discover what you can about a suspected plot of\ninterplanetary financiers to plunge the Earth and Mars into a war.\"\n\n\"How so?\" Sime asked enigmatically, concealing his dismay at the\ngirl's ready reply. Here was inside information with a vengeance!\n\n\"Several shiploads of gray industrial diamonds from Venus have been\nseized by war vessels carrying the insignia of the Martian atmospheric\nguard.\"\n\nSime nodded. \"Go on!\"\n\n\"Curiously enough, these raids were so timed that they were witnessed\nby the news telecasters. All of the people on Earth were thus\neye-witnesses, and feeling ran high. Am I right?\"\n\n\"Go on!\"\n\n\"And of course you know about the raids on the Martian borium mines by\npirates armed with modern weapons. In the fights, some of the pirates'\nweapons were captured. They bore the ordnance marks of the terrestrial\ngovernment.\"\n\n\"I'm way ahead of you, girlie!\" Sime conceded. \"Certain financial\ninterests would like to see a war. They're cookin' up these overt acts\nto get the people all steamed up till they're ready to fight. I'll go\nfurther, since you seem to know all about it anyway, and admit that\nI'm here to find out just who's back of all this. And how does all\nthat tie up with you hiding in my mist-bath with a long and mean\nlookin' knife?\"\n\nThe girl dropped her dark lashes in a sidelong glance at the stiletto\non the floor. There was a little smile on her lips.\n\n\"My usual weapon. Don't you know most of us Martians go armed all the\ntime?\"\n\n\"Yeh?\" Sime grinned skeptically. \"And is it a habit of yours to hide\nin the bedroom of visiting policemen? Come on, kid. I'm going to turn\nyou over to the guard.\"\n\nFor a second it looked as if she would make a dash for the blade\nglistening there on the floor. But she straightened up, and with a\nlook of infinite scorn said:\n\n\"So the mighty policeman of the Sun calls a hotel guard, does he?\nPlease! Believe me, I am myself working for the same object as\nyourself--the prevention of a horrible war!\"\n\nShe was pleading now.\n\n\"Believe me, you are against forces that you don't understand! I can\nhelp you, if you will listen. Let me tell you, the Martian government\nis itself corrupted. The planetary president, Wilcox, is in alliance\nwith the war party. You will have to fight the police. You will have\nto fear poison. You will be set upon and killed in the first dark\npassage. Yet if you help me you may accomplish your object. You must\nhelp me!\"\n\n\"What do you want of me?\"\n\n\"Help me change our government!\"\n\nSime laughed shortly. He began to suspect that this amazing girl was\ndemented. He thought of the powerfully entrenched rulers of this\ntheoretically republican government. For more than two hundred years,\nif he remembered rightly, the Martians had been ruled by a small group\nof rich politicians.\n\n\"You propose a revolution?\" he asked curiously.\n\n\"I propose the return of Princess Sira to the throne!\" she declared\nvehemently. \"But enough! Are you going to betray me--I, who have\nrisked much to warn you? Or are you going to let me go?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSime looked into her warm, earnest little face. Her lips were parted\nsoftly, showing perfect little teeth, and she was breathing quickly,\nanxiously. Sime was woman hungry, as men of the service often are on\nthe long, lonely trail. He seized her quickly, pressed her little\nfigure to him and kissed her.\n\nFor a thrilling instant it seemed that she relaxed. But she tore away,\nfurious, her eyes cold with anger.\n\n\"For that,\" she panted, raging, \"you must die!\"\n\nShe reached the door before he could stop her, and in a trice she was\nout in the gallery. He raced after her, staring stupidly.\nSurprisingly, when her escape was assured, she turned back. Her look\nwas still hurt, angry, as she called to him in low tones:\n\n\"Look out for Scar Balta, you brute!\"\n\n\"Who is Scar Balta?\" Sime asked himself after locking the door again.\nThe name was not unusual and did not bring any familiar associations\nto his mind. The given name, Scar, once a nickname, had been in\ngeneral use for centuries. As for Balta--oh, well--\n\nHis mind reverted to the girl again. Her warm, palpitant presence\ndisturbed him.\n\nHe composed himself to sleep, strapping his dispatch belt around his\nwaist before crawling into bed. He did not believe that the girl had\nhidden in his room with murderous intent; rather that she had hoped to\ninspect and perhaps to steal any papers that he carried. But his last\nconscious thought of her had nothing to do with her connection with\nthis planet of intrigue, but the soft curve of her throat.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n_Scar Balta_\n\n\nSime breakfasted on one of the juicy Martian tropical pears, and as he\ndug into the luscious fruit with his spoon he looked about the\nspacious dining hall, filled with wide-eyed tourists on their first\ntrip to Mars, blissful and oblivious honeymooners, and a sprinkling of\nlocal residents and officials.\n\nThrough broad windows of thick glass (for on Mars many buildings\nmaintain an atmospheric pressure somewhat higher than the normal\noutside pressure) could be seen the north banks of the canal, teeming\nwith swift pleasure boats and heavily loaded work barges. Down the\nlong terraces strolled hundreds of people, dressed in garments of\nvivid colors and sheer materials suitable to the hot and cloudless\ndays. Brilliant insects floated on wide diaphanous wings, waiting to\npounce on the opening blossoms.\n\nBut the terrestrial agent felt that in this scene of luxury there was\na menace. Out of sight, but instantly available, were frightful\nengines of destruction, waiting to be mobilized against the Earth\nbranch of the human race. And on that distant green planet were people\nmuch like these, unconscious still of the butchery into which they\nwere being deftly maneuvered by calculating psychologists, expert\nwar-makers.\n\nHis meal completed, Sime sauntered out into the wide, clean streets of\nNorth Tarog. He purchased a desert unionall suit, proof against the\nheat of day and cold of night, and a wide-brimmed Martian pith helmet.\nHailing a taxi, he relaxed comfortably in the cushions.\n\n\"Nabar mine,\" he told the driver.\n\nThe driver nosed the vehicle up, over the domed roofs of the city and\nover the harsh desert landscape. The rounded prow cut through the thin\nair with a faint whistling, and the fair cultivated area along the\ncanal was soon lost to sight.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter half an hour the metal mine sheds grew out of the horizon. But\neven from a distance of several miles Sime could see that everything\nwas not as it should be. There were no moving white specks of the\nlaborers' white fatigue uniforms against the brown rocks, and no\nclouds of dust from the borium refuse pile.\n\nThe levitator screws of the taxi sank from their high whine to a\ngroan, and the wheels came to the ground before the company office. A\nman in the Martian army uniform came out. His beetle-browed face was\ntruculent, and his hand rested on the hilt of his neuro-pistol.\n\n\"No visitors allowed!\" snapped the guard.\n\n\"I'm not exactly a visitor,\" Sime objected, but making no move to get\nout of the taxi. \"I'm an engineer sent here by the board of directors\nto see why the output of this mine has dropped. Where's Mr. Murray?\"\n\n\"All settled!\" the guard retorted. \"Murray's in jail for mismanagement\nof planetary resources, and the mine's been expropriated to the\ngovernment. Now, you--off!\"\n\nThe driver needed no further order from his fare. The taxi leaped into\nthe air and tore back toward the city. It was clear that the military\nrules of Mars brooked no nonsense from the civilian population, and\nthat the latter were well aware of it.\n\n\"Fast work!\" Sime said to himself with grudging admiration. Murray was\na trusted agent of the terrestrial government. It was he who had first\nuncovered the war cabal. Sime knew his face well from the stereoscopic\nservice record--a bald, placid man of about forty, a bonafide\nengineer, a spy with an unbroken record of success, until now. And a\nfighter who asked no odds, who could manage very well on less than an\neven break. Well, he was up against something now.\n\nThey passed the line of shield-ray projectors, North Tarog's first\nline of defense against an attack of space, hovered over the teeming\nstreets and parks, and settled on the pavement at the Hotel of the\nRepublic. Sime wanted to go to his room and think things over.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFrom the concealment of a doorway an officer with a squad of soldiers\ncame up quickly.\n\n\"You are under arrest!\" said the officer, placing, his hand on Sime's\nshoulder, while the soldiers rested their hands on their\nneuro-pistols.\n\n\"Would it be asking too much to inquire on what charge?\" Sime asked\npolitely.\n\n\"Military arrests do not require the filing of charges,\" the officer\nexplained stiffly. \"Come out of there now, Mr. Hemingway.\"\n\n\"I demand to see the terrestrial consul,\" Sime said, getting out.\n\n\"How about my fare?\" asked the taxi-driver.\n\nSime put his hand into his pocket, where he kept a roll of\ninterplanetary script; but the officer restrained him.\n\n\"Never mind now,\" he said ironically. \"You are a guest of the\ngovernment.\" Then to the driver he added:\n\n\"Get on, now! Get on! File your claim at the divisional office.\"\n\nThe driver departed, outwardly meek before the power of the military,\nand Sime was hustled into an official car. He had little hope that his\ndemand to see the terrestrial consul would be complied with, and this\nopinion was verified when the car rose into the air and sped over the\nwaters of the canal to South Tarog. It did not pause when it came over\nthe military camps there--the massive ordnance depots in which were\nstored new and improved killing tools that had long been idle in that\nirksome interplanetary peace.\n\nThey flew on, over the desert, until the Gray Mountains loomed on the\nhorizon. On, over the tumbled rocks, interspersed with the strange red\nthorny vegetation common in the Martian desert.\n\nFar below them, in a ravine, a cylindrical building was now visible,\nand toward this the car began to drop. It landed on a level space\nbefore the structure. A sliding gate opened, and the car wheeled into\na sort of courtyard, protected from the cold of night by an arching\nroof of glass.\n\nSime was hustled out and led into an office located on the lower floor\nof the fortification, or whatever the structure was.\n\nAs he saw the man who sat at the desk he gave a startled explanation.\n\n\"Colonel Barkins!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe elderly, white-haired man smiled. He brushed back his hair with a\ncharacteristic gesture, and his twinkling blue eyes bored into those\nof the I. F. P. special officer. The colonel wore the regular uniform\nof the service; his little skullcap, with the conventionalized sun\nsymbol denoting his rank, was on the table before him. He put out his\nlean, strong hand.\n\n\"Surprised to see me, eh, Hemingway?\" he inquired pleasantly.\n\nSime managed an awkward salute. \"I don't quite understand, sir. You\ngave me my instructions at the Philadelphia space port just before I\nmade the _Pleadisia_. She's the fastest passenger liner in the solar\nsystem: I've barely landed here, and it seems you got here before me.\nIt don't seem right!\"\n\nSime watched the colonel narrowly, a vague suspicion in his mind, and\nhe thought he saw a slight flicker in the man's eye when Sime spoke.\n\nBut the colonel answered smoothly, with a hint of reproof.\n\n\"Never mind questioning me now, Hemingway. The mission is important. I\nwant to know if you remember every detail of what I told you.\" He\nnodded to the men, and they filed out of the room. \"Repeat your\norders.\"\n\n\"Nothing doing, Colonel!\" Sime replied promptly and respectfully. \"In\nfact, Colonel, you can go to hell! This is the first time that a man\nof the I. F. P. has turned traitor, and if your men hadn't so\nthoughtfully taken my neuro I'd be pleased to finish you right now!\"\n\n\"But you observe I have a neuro in my hand,\" remarked the colonel\npleasantly, \"and so you will remain standing where you are.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSo saying, he slipped off the white wig he was wearing, wiped his face\nso that the brown powder came off, and sat, obviously pleased with\nthe success of his masquerade, useless though it was. He was a typical\nMartian, dark, sleek-haired, coral-skinned.\n\n\"I hate to send a man to his death mystified,\" said the Martian after\na moment, \"so I'll explain that I am Scar Balta!\"\n\n\"Scar Balta!\"\n\n\"You've heard of me?\"\n\n\"Uh--yes and no,\" Sime suddenly remembered the girl of the evening\nbefore--the imperious little Martian. She had warned him of Scar\nBalta.\n\n\"If I do say it,\" said the Martian, \"I am the best impersonator in the\nservice of the interests I represent. I did not expect to get\ninformation of great value from you, but we do not neglect even the\nmost unpromising leads.\"\n\nHe pressed a button; two Martian soldiers answered promptly.\n\n\"Take this man to the cell,\" Balta ordered. \"Provide him with writing\nmaterials so that he can write a last message to his family. In the\nmorning take him to the end of the ravine and finish him with your\nshort sword.\"\n\n\"Yes, Colonel!\"\n\n\"The fellow's a colonel, anyway,\" Sime thought as they led him away.\n\nThey led him downward, along a straight corridor that evidently went\nfar beyond the boundaries of the ravine fortress. In places the walls,\nadequately lit by the glow-wands the guards carried, were plainly cut\nout of the solid rock; in others they were masonry, as though the\nchannel were passing through pockets of earth; or--the thought\nelectrified him--through faults or natural caverns.\n\nAt last they came to the end. One of the guards unlocked a metal door,\nmotioned his prisoner into the prison cell. A light-wand, badly run\ndown and feeble, with only a few active cells left, gave the only\nlight. As the door slammed behind him, Sime took in the depressing\nscene.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe stone walls were mildewed, leprous. The only ventilation was\nthrough small holes in the door. Chains, fastened to huge staples in\nthe uneven stone floor, with smooth metal wrist and ankle cuffs, were\nspaced at regular intervals, and musty piles of canal rushes showed\nwhere some forgotten prisoner had dragged out his melancholy last\ndays. Sime was glad they had not chained him down. Probably didn't\nconsider it necessary unless there were many prisoners, who might rush\nthe guards.\n\n\"Ho, there, sojer!\"\n\nThe voice was startling, so hearty and natural in this sad place. Sime\nsaw something coming out of a far corner. It was a man in the blouse\nand trousers of civilian wear; a bald and good-natured man, with a\nshocking growth of beard.\n\n\"Murray's the name,\" said this apparition with mock ceremony. \"And\nyou?\"\n\n\"I'm Hemingway, Sime Hemingway. Sergeant Sime Hemingway, to be exact.\nSuppose you'd like to hear my orders?\"\n\n\"I don't get you,\" said Murray, shaking hands.\n\n\"I mean,\" Sime explained elaborately, \"that I'd like to know if you're\nScar Balta, or really Murray, as you say you are.\"\n\nThe other laughed.\n\n\"I'm Murray, all right. Feel this scalp. Natural, ain't it? That's one\nthing Balta won't do--shave off his hair. Too vain. He'd hate to have\nthe Princess Sira see him that way. Ever hear of her? Say, she's a\nraving beauty. This Balta'd like to be elected planetary president,\nsee--to succeed Wilcox, who has bigger plans. There's always been a\nstrong sentiment for the old monarchy, anyway. The oligarchy never did\ngo big. Follow me?\"\n\n\"Yeh; go on.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Well, this Princess Sira has ideas. She wouldn't mind sitting on the\nthrone again. Her great-great-grandpa was jobbed and murdered, and the\nnobles who did it formed a closed corporation and called it a\nrepublican government. So Sira started holding audiences, and gained a\nlot of power. Among the people--even among some of the nobles.\n\n\"Get the idea? Scar Balta is one of the electors. If he married Sira\nhe'd have the backing of the monarchists, and of course he's done a\nlot for the bosses. They'd elect him to head off the monarchists,\nanyway. Then heigh-ho for a war with the Earth, to kill off a lot of\nthe kickers--and soft pickins in a lot of ways. Neat, huh?\"\n\n\"Very neat!\" Sime assented drily. \"But we won't live to see it.\nAnyway, I won't. They're going to bump me off in the morning.\"\n\n\"As they have a lot of our men,\" Murray agreed. \"But they won't do it\nin the morning. Or for several days. Look here!\"\n\nHe held up his hand. On the back of it was what appeared to be a boil.\n\n\"But it isn't a boil,\" Murray explained. \"That was done by a stream of\nwater, fine as a needle, under a thousand pounds pressure. They held\nit there for a minute at a time--I don't know how many times, because\nI keeled over. Any time I was willing to give them the information\nthey wanted they'd turn it off. Wasn't important info, either. But\nwhat is it to them, how much they make me suffer for a trifle?\"\n\nSime couldn't help the lump that rose in his throat. Men like Murray\ncertainly justified the world's faith in the service.\n\n\"Listen, old man,\" Sime said in a low voice, \"out in the corridor--\"\n\nBut Murray squeezed his hand warningly, pulled him to the floor.\n\n\"Might as well get some sleep,\" the old man said in ordinary tones.\n\"Plenty cool here. Let's lie together.\"\n\nHe kept his hold on Sime's wrist, and, by alternately squeezing and\nreleasing, began to talk in a silent telegraphic code.\n\n\"Don't say anything of importance,\" he spelled out. \"They have mikes\nin here to pick up all we say. Probably infra-red telenses too, so\nthey can see what we do.\"\n\nSo Sime told him, as they huddled together in simulated sleep, about\nthe walled passages, and they speculated on the possibility of felling\nthe guards and breaking their way to freedom through some underground\ncavern. But at last they slept soundly to await the tortures of the\nnext morning.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n_The Price of Monarchy_\n\n\nHad Sime been able to follow and watch the girl he had kissed under\nsuch unusual circumstances on the night of his arrival on Mars, he\nwould have been both puzzled and enlightened. After her final warning\nabout Scar Balta she dashed into the luxurious gloom of the passage.\nAt an intersection a maid was awaiting her. She curtseyed as she threw\na cape over the girl's shoulder, and together they hurried out into\nthe night.\n\nA magnificently uniformed hotel servant called a private car, drew the\nvitrine curtains, and saluted as the car lifted sharply into the\nchilly night air. The car sped across the canal to the jeweled city\nacross the water, to a residence district whose magnificence even the\npale night light revealed.\n\nThe two women entered a mansion of glittering metal and came to a\nprivate apartment.\n\n\"Everybody's gone to bed,\" said the girl, addressing her maid.\n\"That's one thing we can be thankful for.\"\n\n\"Yes, Your Highness. Did you discover anything of importance in the\nman's room?\"\n\n\"No. Draw me a bath, Mellie. He--he caught me--and kissed me!\"\n\nThe maid, with flasks of perfume and aromatic oils in her hand,\npaused, discreetly impudent.\n\n\"You seem not displeased, Your Highness.\"\n\n\"But of that he had no inkling.\" And Princess Sira laughed. \"I left\nhim standing, utterly at a loss. He took me for a common assassin, and\nyet he wanted to kiss me. That pleased me. But if he had valuable\ninformation he kept it. And I promised him death for his kiss.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs Princess Sira, claimant to the throne of a planet, slipped into the\ntepid waters of her bath, Mellie stood by, her smooth little Martian's\nface disturbed. For she loved her mistress, and could not comprehend\nthe things she did under ambition's sway.\n\n\"Your Highness, couldn't you let your royal friends do these dangerous\nthings for you?\"\n\n\"For what? For fear? And how could a Martian princess who knows fear\nlay claim to a throne? No, Mellie, one gets used to it. The enemies of\nthe house of Sira are ever alert. Didn't they murder my father and my\nmother, and my only brother? My peril in this palace is as great as in\nthe room of a terrestrial detective. Only their fear of the people--\"\n\nShe was interrupted by the tinkling of a bell. The maid left the\nalcove, and returned a moment later with the news that Joro, Prince of\nHanlon, awaited the princess's pleasure in the ante-room.\n\n\"At this hour!\" exclaimed the princess. \"Did he say what brought him\nhere?\"\n\n\"Something about a new plot.\"\n\n\"Plots! They fall thicker than rain on Venus. Bid him wait.\"\n\nFifteen minutes later, swathed in a trailing orange silk robe that\nmade her look like a Venus orchid, she greeted the prince.\n\n\"Greetings, Joro. We seem to have the unusual this night.\"\n\nThe prince, a thin, elderly man of medium stature, smiled admiringly.\nHis sharp features and bright little button eyes gave some hint of the\nenergy which suffused him. Here was a man both ruthless and loyal to\nhis royal house. He addressed her by her given name.\n\n\"The hour seems to make no difference with you; Phobos has set, but as\nlong as you are awake there is loveliness enough. I have come, dear\none, to tell you that success is ours at last!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSira smiled. \"I will restrain my joy, my good Joro, until I hear the\nprice.\"\n\n\"Always the same!\" Joro chuckled. \"A price, 'tis true, but not too\nheavy, since you are, in a manner, fond of him.\"\n\n\"I've had vague promises from Wilcox,\" Sira said, with a wry smile. \"I\nwould rather trade places with Mellie than be espoused by that\nmadman.\"\n\n\"Not Wilcox, but Scar Balta. He is badly smitten, for which I can not\nblame him. He has great political power, and the backing of the\nmilitary. He could have dictated better terms, but for love of you has\nyielded, point after point. He wants nothing now but your hand in\nmarriage, and is prepared to cede to the royal cause all the\nadvantages he has gained--\"\n\n\"Not to mention,\" Sira interjected, \"the royal prestige he will gain\nwith the common people.\"\n\nJoro laughed, a little impatiently.\n\n\"True, true! But after all, what does the support of the people amount\nto? They are powerless. If you are ever to establish your royal house\nyou must have other help.\"\n\n\"And I suppose,\" Sira continued sweetly, \"that you have also arranged\na deal with the central banks and the secret war interests?\"\n\nJoro coughed uncomfortably.\n\n\"As a matter of fact--you see, my dear princess, there are certain\ncommercial interests--transportation, mining, and so forth. They have\ndefied the power of the bankers. They are likely to upset our whole\norder of society. They need a set-back. And the military men are\nchafing at their inaction. The war will be ended before too much harm\nis done, by agreement of the interplanetary bankers. You see--\"\n\n\"No!\" Sira interrupted him coldly. \"No! No! No! Oh, I'm sick of the\nwhole thing! I'm sick of the men I know! I hate Scar Balta, and you\ntoo. I would rather be the wife of a common interplanetary patrolman\nthan queen of Mars! I withdraw, now!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJoro, struck by her vehemence, paled. The muscles of his jaw lumped.\nFrom a pocket he took a portable disk-radio, an inch in diameter, and\nspoke a few words. From outside there was a sudden uproar, shouts and\ncurses. The draperies moved, as with an outrush of air caused by the\ncareless handling of an airlock, and the temperature dropped suddenly.\n\nSira was irresolute only a split second. With a cat-like leap she\nseized a short sword from the wall, made a lunge at the prince. But\nJoro, the veteran of many a battle of wits and arms, parried the\nstroke with the thick barrel of his neuro-pistol, caught the girl's\nwrist and disarmed her. The screams of the maid went unheeded.\n\nFrom the other parts of the palace came sounds of struggle, the\nclashing of sword on sword.\n\n\"Sira! Sira!\" Joro panted, struggling to hold the girl. \"You must\ngive up your impractical ideas! Take the world as it is. Do as I tell\nyou and you'll not be sorry.\"\n\n\"I relinquish my claims!\" the girl cried fiercely. \"To-morrow I will\npublicly announce that decision. All my life has been spent feeding\nthat hopeless ambition. Now I will be free!\"\n\n\"I am loyal to the monarchy,\" Joro grunted, pinioning her arms at\nlast. \"I will guard your interest against yourself.\"\n\nHe began to shout:\n\n\"Hendricks, Mervin, Carpender, Nassus! Here, to the princess's\nchamber.\"\n\nSeveral men, after further delay and fighting, responded. They wore\ncivilian blouses and trousers, but there was that something in their\nalert carriage that proclaimed them trained fighting men. One of them\nsat down with a grunt on the threshold, holding his hand to a bleeding\nwound under his armpit. He appeared to be mortally wounded.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMost of the others carried minor wounds, showing that the palace\nguards had put up a good battle in the sword-play. Both sides had\nrefrained from using the neuro-pistols for fear that the beams, which\nreadily penetrated walls at short range, might injure the princess.\n\n\"Let go!\" Sira wrenched herself free. \"Where is Tolto? Has Tolto\nturned traitor? How did you get past Tolto?\"\n\n\"Do not use that ugly word against me. I implore you!\" Joro protested.\n\"What we are doing is out of loyalty to the monarchy--not treason. The\nmonarchy is of greater importance than individuals. Consider your duty\nto the rule of your fathers! As for Tolto--\"\n\nHe issued a curt command, and there was the sound of movement.\nPresently four men staggered in, one to each leg, each arm, of the\nmost impressive giant Mars had ever produced--Tolto, to whom there was\nno god but the one divinity: and Princess Sira was she. Slow of\nperception, mighty of limb, he had come into her service from some\noutlying agricultural region of the red planet. His tremendous muscles\nwere hers to command or destroy, as she wished. He would not have\nconsented to this invasion of her home, she knew!\n\nAnd he had not. Joro had been too wise to try. A dose of _marchlor_ in\na glass of wine had done what fifty men could not have accomplished by\nmain strength. Tolto was in a drugged sleep.\n\nJoro said: \"He isn't hurt. We will simply send him back to his valley,\nand you, my dear princess, will do your duty to your subjects!\"\n\nAnd there, though he probably did not know it, Prince Joro harked back\nto the youth of the human race--the compensatory, atavistic principle\nthat gods, rulers, kings, must hold themselves in readiness as\nsacrifices for the good of their subjects. Joro might have been a\ntribal high priest invoking their dread rule in the dawn of time. The\nMartians were, for all their scientific advancement, still the\ndescendants of those prehistoric human savages. Sira knew,\ninstinctively, that the people who loved her would nevertheless\napprove of Joro's judgment.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n_Torture_\n\n\nWhen Sime awoke it was to the rattling of the door. Murray stirred.\nThe light was even weaker than before.\n\n\"If they offer you a drink, drink hearty!\" Murray muttered, sitting\nup. \"I've got an idea it's going to be a hard day.\"\n\nBut they were not offered any water. Instead they were again conducted\nbefore Scar Balta, who looked at them morosely. At last he remarked\ngruffly:\n\n\"If you tin sojers weren't so cursed stubborn, you could get yourself\na nice berth in the Martian army. Ever consider that?\"\n\n\"Talk sense!\" Sime said contemptously. \"If I threw down the service\nhow could you trust me?\"\n\n\"That'd be easy,\" Balta rejoined. \"Once the I. F. P. finds out you\njoined us you'd have to stick with us to save your skin.\"\n\nHe laughed at his prisoners' look of surprise.\n\n\"Come, come!\" he bantered. \"You didn't think that I was ignorant of\nyour purpose here? You, Murray; your spying was excellent, I'll admit.\nYou were the first to give away certain plans of ours. Well, well! We\ndon't hold that against you. Wheels within wheels, eh? It would\nperhaps astonish certain braided gentleman of our high command to\nlearn that I, a mere colonel, control their destinies. As our\nancestors would say, it's dog eat dog.\n\n\"Now, how about it? I can make a place for you in my organization. It\nseems to run to secret service, oddly enough. You will be rewarded far\nbeyond anything you could expect in your present career of chasing\npetty crooks from Mercury to Pluto and back again.\"\n\n\"Is that all?\" Murray asked softly, with a bearded grin.\n\n\"Oh no. You will turn over to me all the information you can about the\nI. F. P. helio code. You will name and describe to me each and every\nplainclothes operative of the service--and you should have an\nextensive acquaintance.\"\n\n\"Before you answer,\" Murray said quietly at Sime's side, \"let me\nsuggest that you consider what's in store for us--or you--if you don't\ntake up this offer.\"\n\n\"Why, you--\" Sime whirled in astonished fury upon his companion.\n\"Didn't you--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut he did not complete his reference to last night's surreptitious\nconversation. It seemed that he saw the merest ghost of a flicker in\nMurray's left eye.\n\n\"--Didn't you say you'd stick no matter what they did?\" he finished\nlamely.\n\nMurray hung his head.\n\n\"I'm getting along,\" he muttered. \"Not as young as I used to be. This\nlife is getting me nowhere. Why be a fool? Come along with me!\"\n\n\"Why, you dirty, double-crossing hound!\" Sime's exasperation knew no\nbounds. For an instant he had believed that Murray was enacting a\nlittle side-play in the pursuit of a suddenly conceived plan. But he\nlooked so obviously hangdog--so guiltily defiant....\n\n_Crack!_ Sime's fist struck Murray's solid jaw, scraping the skin off\nhis knuckles, but Murray swayed to the blow, sapping its force, and\ncame in to clinch. They rolled on the floor. Murray twisted Sime's\nhead painfully, bit his ear. But in the next split second he was\nwhispering:\n\n\"Keep your head, Sime. Can't you see I'm stringing him? Take that!\"\nAnd he planted a vicious short hook to Sime's midriff.\n\nBalta had squalled orders, and now Martian soldiers were bursting the\nbuttons off their uniforms in the scrimmage to separate the battlers.\nBruised and battered, they were dragged apart. Murray's one eye was\nnow authentically closed, and rapidly coloring up. Unsteadily he got\nto his feet. With mock delicacy he threw a kiss to his late\nantagonist.\n\n\"Farewell, Trueheart!\" He bowed ironically, and the men all laughed.\n\nBalta grinned too. \"Still the same mind, Hemingway? All right, men,\ntake him up to the observation post. Here, Murray, have a drink.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSime was led up a seemingly endless circular staircase. After an\ninterminable climb he saw the purplish Martian sky through the glass\ndoors of an airlock. Then they were outside, in the rarefied\natmosphere that sorely tried Sime's lungs, still laboring after the\nfight and long ascent. The Sun, smaller than on Earth but intensely\nbright, struck down vindictively.\n\n\"A good place to see the country,\" laughed the corporal in charge.\n\"Off with his clothes!\"\n\nIt was but a matter of seconds to strip Sime's garment from him. They\ndragged him to an upright post, one of several on the roof, and with\nhis back to the post, tied his wrists behind it with rawhide. His\nankles they also tied, and so left him.\n\nIt was indeed an excellent point of vantage from which to see the\ncountry. The fortress was high enough to clear the nearby cliffs of\nlow elevation, and on all sides the Gray Mountains tumbled to the\nhorizon. To the north, beyond that sharply cut, ragged horizon, lay\nthe big cities, the industrial heart of the planet. To the south, at\nSime's back, was the narrow agricultural belt, the region of small\nseas, of bitter lakes, of controlled irrigation. Here the canals,\nnatural fissures long observed by astronomers and at first believed to\nbe artificial, were actually put to the use specified by ancient\nconjecture, just as further north they had been preempted as causeways\nof civilization. Sime painfully worked his way around the post so that\nhe could look south. But here too nothing met his eye but the orange\ncliffs with their patches of gray lichen. There was no comfort to be\nhad in that desolate landscape. Nevertheless, Sime kept moving\naround, to keep the post between himself and the Sun. Already it was\nbeginning to scorch his skin uncomfortably.\n\nBy the time it was directly overhead Sime had stopped sweating. The\ndry atmosphere was sucking the moisture out of his body greedily, and\nhis skin was burned red. His suffering was acute.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Martian day is only a little more than a day on Earth, but to Sime\nthat afternoon seemed like an eternity. Small and vicious, with deadly\ndeliberation, the sun burned its way down a reluctant groove in the\npurple heavens. Long before it reached the horizon, Sime was almost\nunconscious. He did not see its sudden dive into the saw-edge of the\nwestern mountains--knew only that night had come by the icy whistle of\nthe sunset wind that stirred and moaned for a brief interval among the\nrocks. The keen, thin wind that first brought relief and then new\ntortures, to be followed by freezing numbness.\n\nAbove, in the blackness, the stars burned malignantly. Drug to his\nmisery they were, those familiar constellations, which are about the\nonly things that look the same on all planets of the solar system. But\nthey were not friendly. They seemed to mock the motionless human\nfigure, so tiny, so inconsequential, that stared at them, numerous\ntiny pinpricks of light, so remote.\n\nThere was no dawn, but after aeons Sime saw the familiar green disk of\nEarth coming up in the east, one of the brightest stars. Sime fancied\nhe saw the tiny light flick of the moon. There would be a game of\nblackjack going on somewhere there about now. He groaned. The Sun\nwould not be far behind now.\n\nBut he must have slept. The Sun was up before he was aware of it. A\nman with a caduceus on his blouse collar was holding his wrist,\nfeeling his pulse. He seemed to be a medical officer of the Martian\narmy. His smooth, coral face was serious as he prodded Sime's\nshriveled tongue.\n\n\"Water, quick!\" he snapped,--\"or he's done for.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis head was tipped back and water poured into his mouth, but Sime\ncould not swallow. The soldier with the bucket poured dutifully,\nhowever, almost drowning the helpless man. It helped, anyway; and Sime\nreturned to half-consciousness. A few minutes later, when Scar Balta\ncame to inquire if he had changed his mind, Sime was able to curse\nthickly. And around noon, when Murray, jauntily dressed in the uniform\nof a Martian captain, bid him a cheerful good-by, Sime was almost\nfluent.\n\nHis torture had now reached the pitch of exquisite keenness that made\nit something spiritual. Solicitously they kept him alive, and far back\nin his mind Sime wondered why they bothered to do that. Couldn't they\nbe satisfied with what they could learn from Murray?\n\nSo passed the second day, and the third.\n\nOn the fourth day Sime was able to drink water freely, and to eat the\nfood they placed into his mouth, a fact which the medical officer\nnoted. The torture was wearing itself out. Sime's body was emaciated,\nstringy, burnt black. But his extraordinary toughness was weathering\nconditions that would kill most men. Balta shook his head in\nwonderment when this was reported to him.\n\n\"Can't wait any longer for him. Must get back to Tarog. You might as\nwell put him out of his misery. By the way, I'm convinced that Murray\nis double-timing me. But I'll attend to that personally.\"\n\nFrom his post of pain Sime saw the official car leave toward Tarog.\nHad he known of Balta's remark he would not have been puzzled so much\nby what he saw.\n\nAs the ship was about to disappear over the ragged northern horizon,\nSime's bleared eyes saw, or he thought they saw, a human figure\nsilhouetted against the pitiless sky. It was a tiny-seeming figure at\nthat distance, but it was clear-cut in the rare atmosphere. Then it\nplunged from sight.\n\n\"Somebody taken for a ride,\" he muttered, half grateful for the brief\ndistraction from his own misery.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe medical officer, to whom the long climb was arduous, delayed his\nmission to the roof, and that was why, several hours later, Sime was\nstill alive to see another ship appear to the north. It was large,\nsumptuous, evidently a private yacht. Its course would bring it within\na mile of the fortress, and with sudden wild hope Sime realized that\nif he were seen he might expect relief. He began to tug at his bonds.\nThey were tough, but they would stretch a little. His haphazard\nmovements had already worn them against the rough post, and now he\nbegan to struggle violently. If he could only get his hands loose, he\ncould wave....\n\nThe thongs cut into his flesh, but his wrists were numb and swollen,\nand he did not mind the pain. His muscles stood out hard and sharp,\nand with a supreme effort, aided by the growing brittleness of the\nrawhide in the dry atmosphere, he snapped his bonds.\n\nThe ship was now quite near, and he waved frantically. He fancied he\nsaw movement back of the pilot ports. Faintly he heard the hum of the\nlevitators. Now it turned--no! It yawed, now toward him, now away,\npurposelessly, like a ship in distress. It made an abrupt downward\nplunge that scraped a crag, and just missed a canyon wall.\n\nAgain it twisted, came down with a long, twisting motion, struck a\nrock upside down, slitting a long gash in its skin, clattered to the\nrocks so close to the fortress that Sime could not see it. Now\ndesperation gave the prisoner superhuman strength. Regardless of the\npain, he burst the thongs about his ankles, tottered to the edge of\nthe roof.\n\nThere was a battle going on below. Men seemed to be running, shouting.\nSomeone, using a massive plate of metal as a partial shield against\nthe neuro-pistols, was creating havoc. Sime tried to focus his giddy\neyes on the scene. It seemed always to be turning to the left, to be\ncircling around him. With tottering steps he tried to follow it,\nkeeping to the brink of that lofty tower--uselessly. Now it was\nrocking, flying straight toward him, and, gratefully, Sime gave up the\nstruggle, closed his eyes.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n_The Wrath of Tolto_\n\n\nTolto awoke from his drugged sleep in the cargo room of a pleasure\nship. He was thoroughly trussed up, for Prince Joro's servants had a\nwholesome respect for the giant's strength. Even in his supine\nposition power was evident in every line of his great torso, revealed\nthrough great rents in his blouse. His thighs were as big around as an\nordinary man's body, and the smooth pink skin of his mighty arms and\nshoulders rippled with every movement that brought into play the\nbroad, flat bands of muscle underneath.\n\nA chain of beryllium steel was passed around Tolto's waist, and close\nin front of him the smooth, shining cuffs of steel around his wrist\nwere locked to the chain. Short lengths of chain led to cargo\nringbolts in the floor, holding fast Tolto's cuffed ankles.\n\nTo anyone looking at Tolto, just then, these extreme precautions might\nhave seemed absurd. Prince Joro, however, was a good judge of men. It\nwould have pleased him best if Tolto had been quietly eased from his\nsleep into death, but he knew that such a murder would have destroyed\nforever his chances of winning Sira to his plans. He meant to see\nTolto safely and demonstrably returned to his home valley, and in\norder to accomplish this the more surely, he had him loaded aboard his\nown ship, and instructed his captain to take the little used desert\nroute.\n\nTolto lifted his hands as far as he could and looked wonderingly at\nthem. His child-like face, with the soft, agate eyes, expressed only\nbewilderment. He lifted his voice, a powerful bass.\n\n\"Hi, hi! Let Tolto go! The princess may call!\"\n\nThere was no answer, only the rhythmic hum of the levitators. Again\nTolto cried out. But there was no answering sound. The Sun poured in\nthrough the ports, and when presently the ship changed its course, the\nlight fell full in his face, almost blinding him. The giant endured\nthis without complaint.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSeveral hours later, however, his patience snapped, and he roared and\nbellowed so loudly that a door opened and a frightened face appeared.\nBack of it was the chromium glitter of the ship's galley.\n\n\"Be still, big one!\" admonished the cook. \"The captain is resting. He\nwill have you chained standing if you disturb him with your\nbellowing.\"\n\n\"I wanted only to know where I am,\" Tolto replied, subsiding meekly.\n\"I drank overmuch and some larksters tied me up like this. Release me,\nso that if the princess calls I may answer.\"\n\n\"The princess will have to call loudly for you to hear,\" the cook\nanswered jocularly.\n\n\"The princess need only whisper for Tolto to hear,\" the giant boasted,\n\"Come now, shrimp, take these things off!\"\n\n\"Are you really as dumb as that?\" the cook marveled. \"Why, sonny boy,\nthe princess couldn't even hear you! Don't you know where you're\ngoin'?\"\n\nVague alarm began to creep over Tolto.\n\n\"Where is she?\" he asked anxiously. \"Isn't she in this ship? Princess\nSira never goes anywhere without Tolto. Ask her. Ask anybody.\"\n\n\"The princess may never go anywhere without you, you head of bone,\"\nremarked the cook, rather enjoying his own humor, \"but _this_ time\nyou're going somewhere without her.\"\n\n\"You talk funny talk, but I can't laugh at it. Little bug, tell me now\nwhat this is all about, or I will take you between my fingers and\nsquash you!\"\n\nThe cook's coral face paled almost to white despite himself.\n\n\"Listen, big one,\" he said placatingly. \"Have an orange?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTolto refused the gift, although he knew this rare and luscious\nimportation from the Earth and was very fond of it.\n\n\"Once more I ask you, bug, where is she?\"\n\n\"Aw, now, listen!\" the cook whined. \"Don't blame me! I'm only a\nservant around here. How can I help what they do? Don't glare at me\nso. Well, she's at Tarog.\"\n\n\"But why--why does she send me away?\"\n\nThe cook failed to recognize his opportunity to lie in time.\n\n\"Well, the fact is--\" he hesitated. \"The boss--Prince Joro's sending\nyou away. You see, she's going to get hitched up-big important guy.\nThey didn't want you around, bustin' up things every time you turn\naround. So they're sendin' you back home.\"\n\n\"The princess would not send me home like this,\" Tolto objected. But\nhe held his peace, and the cook went back to his work, satisfied that\nhe had subdued this dangerous prisoner.\n\nIn this he was guilty of no greater error than Prince Joro and the\nother monarchists. For ages there had been an unfounded opinion that\nbig men are generally slow and stupid. They may often act so, for\ntheir great strength serves as a substitute for the quick wit of\nsmaller men. But in Tolto, at all events, this prejudice was wrong. In\nTolto's bullet head was a healthy, active brain, and a primitive\ncunning.\n\nSo instead of wasting his strength in vain struggles against the tough\nsteel, he rested, marshalling the facts in his mind.\n\nHe utterly rejected the thought that Princess Sira had consented to\nhis removal in this manner, or in any manner. That meant that she was\nbeing coerced, and Tolto's eyes grew small and hard at the thought.\n\nPresently he began to test the chains. They were of great hardness and\ntoughness, and so smooth that he could not twist them, for the links\nslid over one another harmlessly. However, after much quiet effort he\nfound that he could shift his body several inches toward either side\nof the narrow hold. Here there were a number of locked boxes. One of\nthem, he reasoned, might contain tools.\n\nHis closely confined hands were practically useless. He found that he\ncould not reach any of the boxes with his fingers, strain as he might.\nBut he grinned with hope when his head struck one of the handles. His\nstrong teeth closed down on it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat would have been something to see! The box was of thin, strong\nmetal, but it was heavy. With no other purchase but his teeth, Tolto\ndragged it to him, on top of him. Now his hands could help a little.\nHe inched it down toward his knees, fearful each moment that a lurch\nof the ship might precipitate it to the floor with a crash. When his\nhead could push no longer his knees grasped the end of the chest, and\nmanaged to pull it down.\n\nTolto had never heard of the wrestling hold known as the scissors, but\nhe applied it to that box. His mighty sinews cracked under the strain,\nand stabbing pain tore at his hips. But he persisted, and with a\nprotesting rasp the lid was telescoped inward, breaking the lock.\n\nBreathless, he waited. After minutes he decided that the sound had not\nattracted attention.\n\nAgain he brought his teeth into play, and this time, when the box\nstood open, Tolto's lips were lacerated by the jagged edges of twisted\nmetal. Triumphantly, he looked inside.\n\nThe box contained a set of counterweights for the hydrogen integrator\nmotors.\n\nNo bar, nothing that might be utilized to twist off the eyebolts!\n\nAgain he set to work. The next box was longer, heavier. It was coated\nwith unpleasantly rancid oil. Tolto's broad chest was covered with\nblood, partly from gouges in his skin, partly from his crushed lips.\nBut this time he found a bar. It was in the bottom, under some extra\nvalves, but eventually his teeth closed on it, and he fell back,\nnearly exhausted, for a moment's rest.\n\nHe heard a door slam beyond the galley. The words floated out:\n\n\"--better go see how he's coming along.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe horrified mate saw the wrecked boxes, the blood-covered giant with\na thick steel bar in his teeth, the extra valves scattered about the\nfloor. He whipped out his neuro-pistol, pointed it at Tolto.\n\nBut Tolto made no move to resist when the shaken officer gingerly took\nthe bar out of his mouth. He did not move when several shipmen, called\nby the officer, moved everything out of reach. After half an hour,\nwith many awed comments, they left him alone.\n\nTolto's battered lips opened in what might have been a grin. Painfully\nhe rolled off the single valve that had been digging into the small of\nhis back. He patiently resumed the tedious task of bringing the valve\nin reach of his locked hands.\n\nThe valve stem was stout, and a foot long. It was just long enough so\nthat Tolto, by lying on his side, could reach one of the eyebolts.\n\nInserting the stem, Tolto pulled toward him.\n\nThe eyebolt turned without resistance. It was free to rotate, and\ncould not be twisted off. A groan escaped from the prisoner.\n\nBut in a few moments he tried bending upward. The leverage was highly\ndisadvantageous that way. Still, straining with the last ounce of his\nstrength, he was just able to do it. Pulling down was not so hard.\n\nIt took fifty-four motions, up and down, before the tough metal\ncracked and one chain trailed free.\n\nIt was not long afterward that the cook, turning from his work at the\nelectric grill, stared into a face that had once been innocent and\npeaceful. It seemed the face of a demon.\n\nHe would have shrieked, but Tolto took his arm between thumb and\nforefinger, saying gently:\n\n\"Remember, little bug, what I said!\"\n\nHe was cast, dumb with fear, into the late prisoner's cell.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTolto had not bothered to remove the chains, but only to twist them\napart by means of such tools as he could find to permit free movement\nof his arms and legs. They dangled from him, tinkling musically.\n\nNow he strode into the main cabin. The ship's crew, having no guests,\nwere playing the part of guests. A man who was shuffling cards, was\nthe first to see him. The cards flew up and showered all over the\nroom.\n\n\"He's loose!\" this shipman croaked, diving under the table.\n\n\"Mr. Yens! Mr. Yens!\" shouted the captain, a small, bristling Martian\nwith graying, stiff hair. He snatched the neuro-pistol at his side,\npointed it at Tolto, pressed the trigger.\n\nTolto felt a numbing cold as the ray struck him. But his great body\nabsorbed the weapon's energy to such an extent that he was not killed\nat once. His flailing arms continued their arc, and one end of chain,\nwhistling through the air, struck the weapon from the officer's hand.\nTolto stumbled, recovered. He picked up the pistol and stuck it in his\nchain belt.\n\nHis impulse was to rend, to crush with his hands. The shipmen, except\nfor the officers, were unarmed, and they went down helplessly before\nthe giant fists. Some of them found riot guns, but they might as well\nhave pounded a Plutonian mammoth for all the effect they had on Tolto.\n\nMr. Yens, the mate, sitting at the controls in the glassed-in cabin\nforward, turned his head at the captain's cry, and, looking down the\nshort corridor into the main cabin, saw the blood-covered giant coming\ntoward him. Mr. Yens was a brave man; but he had been careless. His\nneuro-pistol was in his own cabin. He did the best he knew, and\nsnapped the lock.\n\nBut Tolto's great bulk smashed in the door as if it were nothing. The\nunbreakable glass did not splinter, but it bent like sheet metal, and\na blow of the giant's fist broke the mate's neck.\n\nThe mate had not engaged the gyroscopic control, and immediately the\nship began a series of eccentric maneuvers, so sharp and unexpected\nthat no one on board could keep his feet. For a few seconds she\nstraightened, and one of the crew bethought himself of the pistol in\nthe mate's cabin. He sighted on Tolto, clearly visible ahead. Before\nhe could release the ray the ship went into another breath-taking\nmaneuver.\n\nA mountain peak came sliding toward them ominously. They scraped by.\nThe ship dived, throwing Tolto forward, and his instinctive grab threw\nthe elevator up. The levitators screamed madly as they lost their\npurchase on the air, due to the ship's unstable keel.\n\n\"We're goners!\" someone shouted. \"Kill that fool!\"\n\nThey bounced off a cliff, turned over and over like a tumbleweed. A\ncylindrical building, unexpected in this wilderness, loomed up. They\nseemed about to hit it, but floated past. The rock floor of the valley\nrushed up. With a crash the ship rolled over, split wide open.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n_The Fight in the Fort_\n\n\nIts coming had been observed. Men wearing the uniforms of the Martian\narmy dashed out, their pistols ready. A man dropped out of a gaping\nhole in the ship's skin, sat down unsteadily. Others dribbled out.\n\n\"Crazy man in there!\" one of them shouted. \"Look out, he's murderous!\"\nThe pistols came up. The soldiers began to close in, showing a certain\nprofessional eagerness.\n\nThey were perhaps within ten feet when a metal plate, sheared off from\nthe pilot's cabin in the fall, lifted up. Barely visible under it was\na pair of large, running feet. One soldier, trying to oppose it with\nhis hands, was knocked senseless and bleeding. He might as well have\ntried to stop an oncoming rocket ship.\n\nNeuro-pistols, bearing from every side, spanged briskly. They partly\nneutralized one another. Their charges were partly reflected by the\nmetal and partly absorbed by Tolto's great bulk. He was thoroughly\nconfused now. Every way he looked in this glaring wilderness of desert\nand rocks were enemies.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut there! An opening loomed, cool and dark. The fortress entrance.\nTolto dashed into it. There was the sharp challenge of a guard,\nunanswered; the futile hiss of a weapon.\n\nThe improvised shield wedged on a narrowing stairway. Tolto let it\nstick, ran up alone. The stairway went round and round, climbing ever\nhigher. The fugitive's lungs were bursting.\n\nAt last he came to an airlock. He did not know how to operate it, so\nsmashed through. There was no rush of air, because the pressure had\nalready been equalized in the rush to the wreck at ground level.\nPanting, listening for pursuers, Tolto looked around.\n\nHe found himself on a circular roof, bare except for the airlock and a\nnumber of upright posts, whitened by the Sun.\n\nIt was some moments before he saw the unconscious figure of a man\nlying on the very edge of the lofty tower on which he was standing--a\nman naked and blackened. He was lying on his face, one arm and one\nfoot hanging over space as though he had fallen unconscious at the\nvery edge of the abyss.\n\nTolto collected his excited wits. This, at least was no enemy. His\nenemies were in power here. This must be a victim, a possible ally.\n\nThe man was stirring. The overhanging arm was feebly trying to grasp\nsomething. If he were to roll over--\n\nHe did not have time. Tolto dragged him in to the safety of the\nairlock opening, where he could watch.\n\nThere were sounds of pursuit, faint and cautious.\n\nTolto grinned at the naked stranger.\n\n\"Who are you, little bug?\" he asked.\n\nSime Hemingway tried to tell him but his swollen tongue would not\nbehave. Instead, he waved in the general direction of the Sun.\n\nTolto understood. \"From Earth? Good guy, prob'ly. Want this dingus?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSime was able to take the neuro-pistol. He knew what was expected of\nhim, and strove to collect his faculties so he could obey orders. He\ncrawled a little way into the lock, where he could be in comparative\ndarkness, setting the little focalizer wheel at the side of the pistol\nfor maximum concentration. Such a beam would require good aiming,\nbeing narrow, but if it touched a vital center would be infallibly\nfatal.\n\nMeanwhile Tolto appraised one of the posts on the roof. It was firmly\nset in masonry, but he found he could loosen it a little by shaking\nit. Presently he had it uprooted. It made a splendid battering ram, a\nwar club fit for a giant such as he.\n\n\"Here they come!\" Sime croaked, and, peering around a corner, took\ncareful aim at the foremost attacker. At the first whispering impact\nof the beam the Martian sprawled, dead.\n\nThe soldiers were caught at a disadvantage. They were expecting club\nor fist, but not the neuro-beam. Nevertheless Sime had no more easy\nopportunities. The Martians flung themselves down behind the bulge of\nthe curved stairway, and the air became acrid under the malignant\nneuro-beams.\n\nNone of them reached Sime directly, but the stone walls reflected them\nto some extent, and even under their greatly weakened power he become\ncold and sick.\n\nThe situation was by no means to his liking. There were other weapons\nto be reckoned with, and he tried to keep consciousness from slipping\naway from him. When at last his breathing became easier and his\ndiaphragm moved without pain, Sime knew that danger was greatest. For\nthis relief meant that the Martians had withdrawn down the stairway.\n\n\"Good-by, boys!\" he thought, as he sprinted up into the comparative\nsafety of the open. He motioned to Tolto, who stood hopefully waiting\nwith his great war club, to stand clear.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere it was! Sime saw the faint phosphorescent reflection against the\nstone where the stairway curved. He did not wait to see the tiny\npellet of the atomic bomb floating up, but threw himself flat on the\nroof, tugging at Tolto, who understood and followed suit.\n\nEven lying prone, and below the edge of the explosion cone, they were\nnearly blown off the roof. Though no larger than a pinhead, the bomb\nhad the power of a thousand times its weight in fulminate of mercury.\nWhen the rain of small stones and dust had subsided, they rubbed their\neyes and saw that the airlock was no more. In its place was a shallow\npit, ending with the top of the battered stairway.\n\n\"Down after 'em!\" Sime husked out of a raw throat. \"Before they think\nit's safe to come after us!\"\n\nHe led the way, the giant after him, carrying his club and a huge rock\nfragment. Sime saw a cautious peering head, and that Martian died\ninstantly. Then they were around the bend and in the middle of a\nfight. Sime deflected a hand that held a pistol, and its beam killed\nanother Martian who was about to let Tolto have it at close range.\n\nThere was a light-wand affixed to the wall a trifle further down.\nTolto waded through the ruck of smaller men, tore it from its socket\nand hurled it up the stairs. A short sword bit into Sime's shoulder,\nbut there was no force in the stroke, for in that instant Sime\nparalyzed his enemy's heart with the beam.\n\nAn officer barked a command, and the spang of neuro-beams ceased, to\nbe followed by the lethal rustling of swords. The passage was too\ncrowded for the neuro-pistols, giving the outnumbered prisoners the\nadvantage.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTolto could not swing his club, but he hurled it, like a battering\nram, into the middle of twenty or twenty-five of the garrison who were\nstill below him on the steps, trying to get closer. The heavy timber\ncleared a lane and the two stumbled down over crushed bodies. Sime was\nnow the only one to use his pistol, for he had no friends there to\nkill accidentally.\n\nThe Martians, were putting up a game battle. They were heirs to the\ntraditions and the spirit of Earth's best fighting men. Science had\ngiven them deadly and powerful weapons that could kill over long\ndistances, but they preferred to get close to their adversaries.\n\nBut Tolto was a Martian too. He had seized a sword from a dying hand\nand was wielding it with aptitude and power. No formal thrust and\nparry for him, but merely a savage sweep that sent swords, arms and\nheads flying indiscriminately.\n\nSime, following him, his neuro hissing death from side to side,\nmarveled at his ferocity. He saw a bare-bodied, bleeding fighter leap\nto Tolto's back, his sword poised for a downward stab for the jugular.\nKicking viciously at the man who was just then coming at him, Sime\ntried to bring Tolto's would-be killer down. But Tolto himself\nattended to him, dashing him to his death with the elbow of his sword\narm.\n\nThat diversion nearly cost Sime his life. Fortunately for him he\ntripped, and the sword-thrust that was to disembowel him merely gashed\nhis side. Sime was beginning to enjoy the fight. The exercise was\nloosening up his cramped muscles, and the shaky feeling due to the\nreflected beams of the neuro-pistols was leaving him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTolto had smashed down the light-wands as they fought their way down\nthe steps, so that now they were in almost complete darkness. One\ncould still see the occasional rise and fall of a glinting sword and\nthe dark shadow of an arm or head. They were almost clear when Tolto\nreceived his first serious wound, a stab in the abdomen that let out a\nsticky stream of blood.\n\nThere was an interval of silence, broken only by the groans of the\nwounded. The air was thick with the odor of raw blood and pungent with\nozone. They had fought their way down perhaps two hundred feet of the\nstairway, and due to its curve they could see neither top nor bottom.\n\n\"I'm stuck!\" Tolto muttered.\n\n\"Bad?\" Sime edged to his side, stepping, in the darkness, on the body\nof the man who had succeeded in delivering that sword-stroke before\nTolto's own blade had cleft him. He felt the edges of the wound, but\nin the darkness could not tell how serious it was.\n\n\"Feel sick? Any retching?\" he croaked anxiously.\n\n\"Tolto's all right,\" the giant assured him. \"I just said I was stuck.\"\n\nSime managed to make a hurried bandage out of the slashed fragment of\nTolto's blouse, and again they resumed their descent. Strangely, their\nenemies further up made no move to attack, although there were many\nleft alive.\n\nSime laid his hand on Tolto's arm.\n\n\"Something wrong here. There's somebody at the bottom of the steps,\nand the fellows above want to give him elbow room. Well, we'll soon\nsee!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey crawled up a short distance, began to haul inert bodies down,\ndragging them as far as the last curve, until they had formed a\nbarricade of nineteen or twenty of their late enemies. It was\nunpleasant work, but justified by following events.\n\n\"Can you just see the loom of it?\" Sime asked.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Watch!\"\n\nSime felt about until he found a small fragment broken from the stone\nsteps. Keeping well within the shelter of the convex wall, he crept\ntoward the bend.\n\n\"Dig your fingers into a joint and hold on,\" he instructed Tolto,\nlocating a crack for himself. Then he tossed the fragment gently over\nthe barricade of bodies.\n\nThere was the click of its fall, and a moment later things seemed to\nturn around. Clinging like leeches to the wall, the two men resisted\nthe warped gravitational drag that would have flung them down upon\ntheir waiting enemies below. They seemed to be hanging in a well.\nSime had a confused impression of piled-up bodies hurtling down--down.\n\nThereafter everything was normal again, and they were running down the\nnormal steps. Both had swords in their hands now, and within a hundred\nfeet they were upon the \"gravitorser\" gun. It was a rather cumbersome\nweapon, comprising a great deal of electrical apparatus, with a\nD-solenoid surmounting, whose object was to twist the normal lines of\ngravitation. It was intended for large-scale operations in the open;\nthe few men remaining below had tried a rather risky experiment, for\nthey might have brought the whole fortress down upon them. Now they\nwere untangling themselves from the corpses that had flown at them as\niron flies to a magnet.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSime and Tolto struck them like a tempest. The light was good and the\nbattle short and sweet. Tolto was slowed up a little, but was\nirresistible, nevertheless. There is nothing surprising about the\nseeming immunity of a reckless man in battle. He fights by instinct,\ntaking short-cuts that are not as dangerous as they look because the\nenemy is not expecting them. So Sime and Tolto fought their way down,\nuntil there was no one able to oppose them.\n\nSime pressed a neuro-pistol into Tolto's hand, warned him to sweep the\nstairs with it, while he coursed around for some of the pellet bombs.\nHe found them, and two of them closed that avenue of attack with a\nmass of jumbled ruins.\n\nNow they had a breathing spell. A combination of blind luck and\nfoolhardiness had given them temporary possession of this desert\noutpost. That was their pawn in the game of life and death--the chance\nto get back and hide among the millions in the cities of the\nindustrial belt. Certain routine precautions had to be taken. They\ndestroyed the radio apparatus, picked a few days supply of food, threw\na couple more bombs and made a search for means of transportation: for\nthere was a desert wilderness of four or five hundred miles to be\ntraversed.\n\nThey discovered the egg-shaped hull of an enclosed levitator car in\nthe covered courtyard. It was distinguished by the orange and green\nstripes which are the Martian army standard. Like all army equipment,\nit was in excellent condition. The hydrogen gages showed a full supply\nof fuel.\n\n\"We're getting the breaks,\" Sime crowed to Tolto at they surfeited\nthemselves with water before starting. He had covered his nakedness\nwith an ill-fitting fatigue suit.\n\n\"Yeh,\" Tolto agreed, referring to their numerous wounds with sly\nhumor: \"lots of 'em.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNevertheless, they felt pretty happy when the levitator screws took up\ntheir melancholy whine. The rocky valley floor dropped away, and the\nwindowless stone walls of the fortress slid down past them. Now they\nwere even with the top.\n\nThrough the ports they could see a group of their late adversaries on\nthe roof, standing in strained attitudes. Their immobility was\nexplained a moment later by an electric blue spark from something in\nthe shadow of their bodies.\n\nInstantly Sime, who was at the controls, threw her hard-a-port, dived,\nlooped up. The first explosion of the tiny projectile tossed them up\nlike a monstrous wave, allowed them to drop sickeningly. The exhaust\ntubes poured out a dense haze as Sime sought for distance. But they\nwere following him. He was five miles away when they finally got the\nrange. The vessel was jarred as if it had hit a rock. One of the\natomic pellets had exploded within a few feet of it. There was a\ndismaying lurch. Sime picked himself up from the floor and dashed to\nthe controls.\n\n\"Everything's all right!\" he shouted excitedly.\n\nTolto, however, was listening anxiously. There was a sharp crackling\nat the stern, where, in a narrow space, the reaction motors provided\nthe forward motive power. In moments of excitement he referred to\nhimself in the third person. He did so now.\n\n\"Tolto's afraid that something's wrong! Smells hot, too!\"\n\n\"Here, take the wheel!\" Sime ordered. The explosions of the shells\nwere becoming less dangerous; they were getting too far away.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSime burned his hand opening the narrow door. The paint was already\nblistering off it. The trouble was immediately apparent. One of the\nintegrator chambers, in which atomic hydrogen was integrated to form\natomic iron and calcium (sometimes called the Michelson effect), had\nsprung a leak. The heat escaping into the little room was not the\ncomparatively negligible heat of burning hydrogen, but the cosmic\nenergy of matter in creation. Sime slammed the door. The radiated\nlight was so intense that it stung even his hardened skin.\n\nLooking through the rear range-finding periscope, he saw that they\nwere about twenty miles from the fort. They had ceased firing.\n\n\"Won't be long, Tolto,\" he said, taking over the controls himself\nagain, \"before our tail's going to drop off. Got to make time.\"\n\nIt was, in fact, about ten minutes when, without warning, their nose\ndropped.\n\n\"Tail's gone!\" Sime announced.\n\nTheir momentum, under the destructive rate of speed they had been\nmaking, was great, and as the levitators, with independent power\nsupply, still held them up, Sime continued to steer a course for the\ntwin cities of Tarog. He was aided by a light breeze, and the Sun was\nnearing the western horizon by the time their rate of motion had\nbecome negligible.\n\n\"Might at well land,\" Sime decided. \"Conserve fuel. If we get a\nfavorable wind to-morrow we can go up and drift with it.\"\n\nBut Tolto, who had been narrowly scanning the terrain, advised\ncontinuing a little longer.\n\n\"I thought I saw a little smoke, a few miles ahead. Seems to be gone\nnow. But we're still drifting slow.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSime searched the indicated spot in the ground glass of the forward\nmagnifying periscope. After a few minutes he discovered a blackened\nspot which might be the remains of a fire. It was surrounded by huge\nblocks of orange rock, the igneous rock which is the outstanding\nfeature of the Martian desert landscape.\n\n\"Looks like he built the fire around there so nobody on the same level\nwould see him,\" he hazarded. He set the altitude control to fifty\nfeet. There was part of the globular skeleton of a desert hog in the\nfire; whoever had built it had dined most satisfyingly not long\nbefore, and as the fugitives looked their stomachs contracted\npainfully.\n\n\"I could eat a whole one of them myself,\" Tolto said wistfully.\n\nThe urge to descend here was strong upon Sime too. He realized that\nthe fire might have been made by some dangerous criminal--a fugitive\nfrom justice; but dangerous men are no novelty to the I. F. P. On the\nother hand, there was a possibility that it was just some political\noffender, driven into the desert by persecution. Or a prospector. At\nany rate, he would have food, or would know where it could be\nprocured.\n\nThey had drifted some hundreds of yards farther and the ground was\ngetting constantly more broken, so the best time to land was as soon\nas possible. Slowly the little ship settled, scraped on a rock and\narrested its slight forward motion, crunching solidly in the stony\nsoil.\n\n\"Take a neuro, Tolto,\" Sime advised. \"Whoever's here, if he or they\nare dangerous, we won't get close enough to touch 'em with a sword.\"\n\nTolto took the weapon without a word. They locked the door of the\nship. Men have been marooned for neglecting that little precaution.\n\nThey walked in a spiral course, making an ever-widening circle,\nlooking sharply from left to right. Presently they came to the remains\nof the fire. The ashes were hotter than the ground, proving that they\nhad been recently made.\n\nBut nowhere was there any sign of men. They shouted, but only weird\nechoes answered.\n\nThe ship was now out of sight, and solitude pressed upon them. They\nfelt an uneasy desire to get within comfortable constricting walls.\n\nThey found the ship without difficulty.\n\n\"Well, whoever it was has lammed,\" Sime concluded. \"Tolto, you climb\non top of that rock. Watch me. If you see anybody after me, let 'em\nhave it. I'm going to see if I can scare up a desert hog somewhere.\"\n\nNeither had stirred from his place, however, before they were suddenly\nstricken to the ground. They felt the familiar sensation of cold and\nsuffocation--the paralysis caused by a diffused beam from a\nneuro-pistol. Tolto was a little slower to fall, but he only lasted a\nsecond longer. They knew that someone was taking the weapons out of\ntheir helpless hands. Then life returned.\n\n\"Get up,\" said a languid voice back of them, \"and let's have a look at\nthe looks of ye.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n_The Flight of a Princess_\n\n\nThe province of Hanlon, Prince Joro's hereditary domain, began about\nfifty miles west of South Tarog. It was a region of thorn forests,\nyielding a wood highly valued for ship-building, and the canal was\nlined with shipyards, most of which belonged to the prince. The\nso-called republic had been established before Joro was born, but the\nreigning family of Hanlon had always been richly endowed with\nastuteness. Deprived of their feudal holdings by a coup of state, they\nhad won back nearly all they had lost in the fields of finance and\ntrade. Joro was a monarchist for sentimental reasons, not for the\nprofits that might accrue to him.\n\nIt was the purity of Joro's devotion to his ideal that made him so\ndangerous to all who might oppose him. Lesser men might be bribed,\nfrightened, distracted. Not Joro: he believed that the monarchy would\nsoothe the rumblings of internal dissension that continually disturbed\nthe peace and tranquillity of Mars. He drove forward to that\nconsummation with a steadfastness and singleness of purpose such as\nhave carried other fanatics to glory or to the grave. And in addition\nto his zeal he carried into the struggle his exceptional ability, a\nknowledge of government and of people.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe had need for all of his rare skill now. It had been an easy matter\nto carry forcibly the Princess Sira to his palace in Hanlon. Tolto was\nsafely out of the way; Mellie had been dismissed. As for the other\npalace servants, they had been silenced with bribery or the stiletto.\n\nBut Sira had remained adamant, and Joro, abstractedly toying with his\nlaboratory apparatus in the basement of his palace, tried to find the\nkey to her change of heart.\n\n\"Can't understand it!\" he mused. \"She always seemed to have all the\nroyal instincts: cold to suitors, with that delicacy and reserve one\nfinds ideal in a princess. She does all things well, handles a sword\nnearly as well as I do. Her mind is as keen and limpid as a diamond.\nShe swims like an eel....\"\n\nHe sighed. \"I thought she and I saw eye to eye in this matter. Not\nmore than a week ago she seemed eager for news of the accord I was\narranging. She had no great aversion to Scar Balta. Now she says she\nwill die before she espouses him.\"\n\nHe paused, thought a moment, added, with that absolute fairness and\nimpartiality that was characteristic of him:\n\n\"True, Balta is not the ideal prince consort. He would not add kingly\nqualities to the royal line. But he would confer cunning upon his\noffspring; and energy--neither to be despised in a royal family that\nmust forever resist intrigue.\" He sighed again. \"The responsibility of\nking-making is a hard one!\"\n\nA sudden thought struck him. \"She spoke warmly about the proposed war;\ncould that be at the root of her strange change of heart? After all,\nshe is a woman, and with all her fine, true temper she has a gentle\nheart. To her the death of a few thousands of her subjects may not\noutweigh the unhappiness that millions are now experiencing. But the\nfinanciers demand the war to consolidate their position, and Wilcox is\nsolidly with them.\"\n\nWith new hope he set down the beaker he was toying with. \"Perhaps we\ncan outwit them.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe left the laboratory, climbed a flight of stairs, entered the\nspacious reception hall. This, like most Martian buildings, was domed.\nIt was richly furnished. The walls were hung with burnished, metallic\ndraperies of gorgeous colors, the floor a lustrous black, the\nfurniture of glittering metal. As the prince entered a servant stepped\nforward.\n\n\"Go at once to the Princess Sira's chamber!\" Joro commanded sharply.\n\"Request her to come here. Tell her I have thought of the solution to\nour difficulty.\"\n\nImpatiently he paced up and down, stopping at a window for a moment\nand looking out into the night.\n\n\"Your Highness! Your Highness!\" The servant was sobbing with\nexcitement. \"Your Highness, Princess Sira has escaped!\"\n\nJoro left the man babbling, dashed up the broad stairs, unheeding the\nservants who scattered before him. Their punishment could wait. Just\ninside the princess's chamber, still unconscious from a blow on the\nhead, lay the guard whose duty it had been to stand before that door.\nHow long ago had she gone? Probably not more than a few minutes.\n\nJoro saw to it that her start would not be much longer. In a few\nseconds men and women were scouring the palace grounds, and radio\norders to the provincial police of Hanlon were crowding the ether.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSira had contrived her escape without any particular plan in mind. In\nfact, it had been initiated on impulse. The fellow on guard at her\ndoor had excited intense dislike in her. High-strung, and excited by\nher kidnaping, she had been further annoyed by his officiousness, his\nfawning, which thinly disguised impudence. The third or fourth time\nthat he intruded on her privacy to ask if she wanted anything she was\nready, with the heavy leg, unscrewed from a chair. She felled him in\nthe middle of a smirk, and seized the opportunity created.\n\nIt happened that there was a service corridor close at hand. Down this\nshe sped, into the darkness of a boat-house. The doors were barred and\nlocked, of course, but the depths of the water showed a faint greenish\nglimmer of light. Sira dived in, unhesitatingly, and after an easy\nunderwater swim she emerged in the open canal. There was a\nconsiderable swell, for there was a slight breeze blowing from the\nnorth across twenty miles of water, but this did not distress Sira at\nall. She undulated through the waves with perfect comfort. Phobos was\njust rising in the west, and orientating herself by this tiny moon she\nstruck out in a north-easterly direction, seeking a favorable current\nto carry her toward Tarog.\n\nEarly explorers on Mars were astonished to find that the canals were\nnot stagnant bodies of water, but possessed currents, induced by wind,\nby evaporation, and the influx of fresh water from the polar ice caps.\n\nThis was near the equator, however, and the water was not unreasonably\ncold, although the night air was, as usual, chilly. After a few\nminutes Sira discarded her clothing, and so settled down to a long\nswim.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTen miles out she struck a brisk easterly current, flowing toward\nTarog, and she gave herself up to it. Floating on her back she saw the\nlights of the prince's ships flying back and forth over the water in\nsearch of her--or her body. But none came near her, and she was\ncontent.\n\nThe abrupt tropical dawn found her in mid-canal, half-way to Tarog.\nShe had no intention of swimming all the way to the capital city, to\nbe fished ignominiously out of the canal by the police. She was in\nneed, not only of clothing, but of clothing that would disguise her.\nHer coral pink body near the surface of the water would attract\nattention for considerable distance, and would lead to unwelcome\ninquiries.\n\nShe was glad when she saw a fishing scow anchored in the current ahead\nof her. The man who owned it had his back to her, fishing\ndown-current. She approached the boat silently and worked her way\naround it by holding to the gunwale.\n\nSira now saw that the fisherman was old, gnarled and sunburned so dark\nthat he was almost black, despite the dilapidated and dirty pith\nhelmet he was wearing. His lumpish face was deeply seamed and\nwrinkled. His sunken mouth told of missing teeth, and his long,\nunkempt hair was bleached to a dirty gray.\n\n\"Have you an old coat you can lend me?\" Sira asked, swimming into\nview.\n\nThe rheumy eyes rolled, settled on the water nymph. The old man showed\nno surprise, but pious disgust. His eyes rolled up, and in a cracked\nvoice intoned:\n\n\"Wicked, wicked! O great Pantheus, thy temptations are great--thy\nvisions tormenting. In my old age must I ever and ever live over--\"\n\n\"Foolish old man!\" Sira snapped. \"I'm not a vision!\" She dragged down\nan old sack that hung over the gunwale, washed it, and tearing holes\nin the rotten fabric for her arms and head, slipped it on. It was a\nlarge sack, coming to her knees; satisfied, she climbed aboard, where\nshe spread her black hair to dry.\n\n\"Not a vision?\" the old man quavered. \"Then thou art reality, come to\ngladden my old age--nay--to return youth to me! In my hut there is an\nold hag. She shall go--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSira did not answer. She was neither disgusted nor amused by the dark\ntorrent that stirred in this decrepit old fisherman. She saw only that\nhe had pulled in his nets and was bowing his long arms to the oars,\npulling for shore.\n\nIt took about two hours before they reached the fisherman's hut, a\nnondescript, low-ceilinged shelter of logs, driftwood and untarnished\nmetal plates off some wreck. Several times they were hailed by other\nfishermen, who addressed the old man as \"Deacon\" and asked jocularly\nabout what kind of a fish he had there.\n\nThe deacon's wife awaited them. The old man's description of her as a\nhag had not been far wrong. She, was as diminutive and weakened as he\nwas ponderous and heavy. She was acid. Her skin was like a pickled\napple's; her expression sour, her voice sharp.\n\n\"Hoy there, you old hypocrite!\" she hailed when they came in earshot.\n\"So this is the way you lose a day! Who's the hussy with you?\"\n\nThe deacon nosed the old and evil-smelling scow into the bank. His\neyes rolled piously.\n\n\"The great Pantheus sent her. He said--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe old woman came closer and inspected Sira, who endured her gaze\ncalmly. That look was like the bite of acid that reveals the structure\nof crystal in metals.\n\n\"Why, she's a lady!\" she exclaimed then. \"Not fittin' to be on the\nsame canal with you! Come in, my dear. You must be nearly dead!\"\n\nShe conducted Sira into the hut, which was far neater and cleaner than\nits exterior suggested.\n\n\"A lady!\" she repeated. \"In that heat! Young woman, what made you do\nit? Look at those arms--near burnt! Let me take off that old sack. But\nwait!\"\n\nShe tip-toed to the door, threw back the faded curtain sharply. The\ndeacon, too surprised to move, was standing there in the attitude of\none who seeks to see and hear at the same time. He lingered long\nenough to receive two resounding slaps before fleeing to his boat,\nfollowed by a string of curdling remarks.\n\nBack inside, she proceeded to anoint Sira's body, exclaiming her\npleasure at its perfection. The oil smelled fishy, but it was\nsoothing, and it was not long before the claimant to the throne of\nMars was deep in restful slumber.\n\nLate that afternoon the deacon returned and hung his nets up to dry.\nHe was dour, his fever having left him. But he had a strange story to\nimpart.\n\n\"I think that girl I picked up is the Princess Sira,\" he told the old\nwoman. \"On the fish buyer's barge, in the teletabloid machine, I saw\nthe forecast of her wedding to Scar Balta. And I'll swear it's the\nsame girl!\"\n\n\"And why,\" queried his wife, \"would she be swimming in the middle of\nthe canal if she was getting ready to marry Scar Balta?\"\n\n\"That's just it!\" the deacon exclaimed, and his eyes began to roll\nagain. \"They say it's not a love match! Oh, not in the teletabloid!\nThey wouldn't dare hint such a thing. But the men on the barge. They\nsay there's a rumor that she ran away. And she looks like the girl I\npicked up, though I thought--\"\n\n\"Never mind what you thought!\" she snapped. \"It may be, I served the\noligarchy and the noble houses--before I was fool enough to run away\nwith a no-good fisherman--and I can see she is a lady. Well, she can\ntrust in me.\"\n\n\"They say,\" the deacon hinted, \"that if one went to Tarog, and\ninquired at the proper place, there would be a reward.\"\n\nThe little old woman chilled him, she looked so deadly.\n\n\"Deacon Homms!\" she hissed. \"If you sell this poor little girl to Scar\nBalta, your hypocritical white eyes will never roll again, because\nI'll tear them out and feed them to the fish. Understand?\"\n\nConsiderably shaken, the deacon said he understood.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut the next morning, on the placid bosom of the canal, he forgot her\nwarning. The fleshpots of Tarog called him. Tarog, where he had spent\nyouth and money with a lavish hand. Tarog, where a reward awaited him.\n\nHe hauled in his anchor, gave the unwieldy boat to the current and\nbent to the oars.\n\nBack in the hut, unsuspecting of treachery, Mrs. Homms and Sira were\nrapidly striking up a friendship. A shrewd judge, of character\nherself, Sira did not hesitate to admit her identity, and without any\nprying questioning the old woman soon had the whole story. It thrilled\nher, this review of the life she had once seen as a servant.\n\n\"I wonder if I will ever see Tarog again!\" she sighed wistfully.\n\n\"You shall!\" Sira promised, \"if you help me.\"\n\n\"I will do what I can gladly.\"\n\n\"I need a workingman's trousers and blouse, and a sun-hat that will\nshade my face. I have a plan, but I must get to Tarog. Can you get me\nthese things?\"\n\n\"I have no money, but wait!\" She rummaged with gnarled fingers in a\nchink in the wall, withdrew a small brooch-pin of gold, with a pink\nterrestrial pearl in its center.\n\n\"My last mistress gave me this,\" she said smiling sadly. \"I will row\nto the trading boat and buy what you need. There will be a little\nmoney left to buy your passage on a freight barge.\"\n\nAnd that was why, when the deacon arrived at the head of a squad of\nsoldiers that evening, there was no girl of any description to be\nfound. Ignoring the cowering and unhappy reward seeker, the old woman\ndelivered her dictum to the sergeant in charge.\n\n\"Princess? Ha! The deacon, sees princesses and mermaids in every mud\nbank. His imagination grew too and crowded out his conscience. No,\nmister, there ain't any princess here.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n_In the Desert_\n\n\nMellie, Sira's personal maid, was too disturbed by her mistress's\nkidnaping to seek other employment. She saw the teletabloid forecasts\nof the wedding, made life-like by clever technical faking, but rumors\nof the princess' escape were circulating freely despite a rigid\ncensorship. She imagined that lovely body down in the muck of the\ncanal, crawled over by slimy things, and she was sick with horror.\n\nMellie lived with her brother, Wasil Hopspur, and her aged mother.\nWasil was an accomplished technician in the service of the\nInterplanetary Radio and Television Co., and his income was ample to\nprovide a better than average home on the desert margin of South\nTarog. Here Mellie sat in the glass-roofed garden, staring moodily at\nthe luxuriant vegetation.\n\nShe looked abstractedly at the young man coming down the garden walk,\nannoyed by the disturbance. There was something familiar in the sway\nof his hips as he walked.\n\nAnd then she flew up the path. Her arms went around the visitor, and\nMellie, the maid, and Princess Sira kissed.\n\nMellie was immediately confused. A terrible breach of etiquette, this.\nBut Sira laughed.\n\n\"Never mind, Mellie. It is good for me, a fugitive, to find a home.\nWill you keep me here?\"\n\n\"Will I?\" Mellie poured into these words all her adoration.\n\n\"Mellie, the time has come for action. Not for the monarchy. I am sick\nof my claims. I would give it all--You remember the young officer of\nthe I. F. P.? The one who kissed me?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, that comes later. First I must consider the war conspiracy.\nHave you heard of it?\"\n\n\"There are rumors.\"\n\n\"They are true. Will Wasil help me?\"\n\n\"He has worshiped you, my princess, ever since the time I let him help\nme serve you at the games.\"\n\n\"One more question.\" Sira's eyes were soft and misty. \"My dear Mellie,\nyou realize that I may be trailed here? What may happen to you?\"\n\n\"Yes, my princess. And I don't care!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs Murray parted from his brother-in-arms, Sime Hemingway, on the roof\nof the cylindrical fortress in the Gray Mountains, he felt the\nlatter's look of bitter contempt keenly. He longed bitterly to give\nSime some hint, some assurance, but dared not, for Scar Balta's\ncynical smile somehow suggested that he could look through men and\nread what was in their hearts. So Murray played out his renegade part\nto the last detail, even forcing his thoughts into the role that he\nhad assumed in order that some unregarded detail should not give him\naway. He convinced the other I. F. P. man, anyway.\n\nBut Murray had an uneasy feeling that Balta was laughing at him, and\nwhen the shifty soldier politician invited him into his ship for the\nride back to Tarog, Murray had a compelling intuition that he would\nnot be in a position to step out of the ship when it landed on the\nparkway of Scar Balta's hotel.\n\nHaving infinite trust in his intuitions, Murray thereupon made certain\nplans of his own.\n\nHe noted that the ship, which was far more luxurious than one would\nexpect a mere army colonel to own, had a trap-door in the floor of the\nmain salon. Murray pondered over the purpose of this trap. He could\nnot assign any practical use for it, in the ordinary use of the ship.\n\nBut he could not escape the conviction that it would be a splendid way\nto get rid of an undesirable passenger. Dropped through that trap-door\na man's body would have an uninterrupted fall until it smashed on the\nrocks below.\n\nMurray then examined the neuro-pistol that had been given him. It\nlooked all right. But when he broke the seal and unscrewed the little\nglass tube in the butt, he discovered that it was empty. The gray,\nsynthetic radio-active material from which it drew its power had been\nremoved.\n\nMurray grinned at this discovery, without mirth. It was conclusive.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt the first opportunity he jostled one of the soldiers, knocking his\nneuro-pistol to the floor--his own, too. And when he apologetically\nstooped and retrieved them the mollified soldier had the one with the\nempty magazine.\n\nSo far, so good. Murray noted that the wall receptacles were all\nprovided with parachutes. It would be simple to take one of these,\nmake a long count, and be on the ground before he was missed. Provided\nthat he could leave unobserved.\n\nThe ship was now well in the air, and beginning to move away from the\nfort. But they were only ten miles away, and Murray had hardly\nexpected that Balta would be in such a hurry.\n\n\"You get off here!\" Balta said, and Murray felt the muzzle of the\nneuro-pistol on his spinal column.\n\nA grinning soldier seized a countersunk ring and raised the trap-door.\n\n\"So you're going to murder me,\" Murray said, speaking calmly.\n\n\"I take no chances,\" was Balta's short answer. \"Step!\"\n\nMurray stepped, swaying like a man in deadly fear. He lowered his feet\nthrough the hole. Looking down, he saw that they were about to pass\nover a bitter salt lake, occasionally found in the Martian desert. He\nlooked up into the muzzle of the menacing neuro-pistol.\n\n\"Balta, you're a dog!\" he stated coldly.\n\n\"A live dog, anyway,\" the other remarked with a twisted grin. \"You\nknow the saying about dead lions.\"\n\nMurray's fingers clenched on the edge of the rug. It was thin and\nstrong, woven of fine metal threads. They were just over the edge of\nthe salt lake.\n\nMurray dropped through, but retained his death-like grip on the rug.\nIt followed jerkily, as the men above tripped, fell, and rolled\ndesperately clear.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMurray's heart nearly stopped as he fell the first thousand feet. The\nrug, sheer as the finest silk, failed to catch the wind. It ran out\nlike a thin rivulet of metal, following Murray in his unchecked drop.\n\nBut he had a number of seconds more to fall, and he occupied the time\nleft to him. He fumbled for corners, found two, lost precious time\nlooking for the others. He had three corners wrapped around one hand\nwhen the wind finally caught the sheer fabric, bellied it out with a\nsharp crack. The sudden deceleration nearly jerked his arm out.\n\nEven so, he was still falling at a fearful rate. The free corner was\ntrailing and snapping spitefully, and the greasy white waters of the\nlake were rushing up!\n\nAt any rate, the rug held him upright, so that he did not strike the\nwater flat. His toes clove the water like an arrow, and the rug was\ntorn from his grasp. The water crashed together over his head with\nstunning force. After that it seemed to Murray that he didn't care. It\ndidn't matter that his eyes stung--that his throat was filled with\nbitter alkali. All of his sensations merged in an all-pervading,\ncomfortable warmth. There was a feeling of flowing blackness, of time\nstanding still.\n\nMurray's return to consciousness was far less pleasant. His entire\nbody was a crying pain: every internal organ that he knew of harbored\nan ache of its own. He groaned, and by that token knew that he was\nbreathing.\n\nAs unwillingly he struggled back to consciousness he realized that he\nwas inside a rock cave, lying on a thin, folded fabric that might well\nbe the rug that had served as an emergency parachute. He could see the\nirregular arch of the cave opening, could catch hints of rough stone\non the interior.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe sat up with an effort. There was a vile taste in his mouth, and he\nlooked around for something to drink. There was a desert water bottle\nstanding on the floor beside him. That meant he had been found and\nrescued by some Martian desert rat who had probably witnessed his\nfall. He rinsed out his mouth with clean, sweet spring water from the\nbottle, drank freely. His stomach promptly took advantage of the\nopportunity to clear itself of the alkali, and Murray, controlling his\ndesire to vomit, crawled outside into the blinding light of the\nMartian afternoon. He saw that the cave was high up on the side of one\nof the more prominent cliffs. There were many such hollowed places,\nindicating that the sloping shelf on which he now lay had once been\nthe beach of a vast sea which at some time must have covered all but\nthe higher peaks of the Gray Mountains. It was, of course, the sea\nthat had deposited the scanty soil which here and there covered the\nrocks. During geologic ages it shrunk until it all but disappeared,\nleaving only a few small and bitter lakes in unexpected pockets.\n\nThere was a succession of prehistoric beaches below Murray's vantage\npoint, marking each temporary sea level, giving the mountain a\nterraced appearance. A thousand feet below was the white lake,\nsluggish and dead.\n\nMurray was looking for the man who had saved him. He was able to\ndiscern him, after a little effort, toiling up the steep slopes. He\nwas still nearly all the way down. He could see only that he seemed to\nbe dressed in white desert trousers and blouse, and that he wore a\nbroad-brimmed sun helmet. He was carrying something in a bag over his\nshoulder. He was making the difficult ascent with practiced ease, his\nbody thrown well forward, making fast time for such an apparently\ndeliberate gait.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe desert glare hurt Murray's eyes. He closed them and fell asleep.\nHe awoke to the shaking of his shoulder, looked up into a\nblack-bearded face, a beard as fierce and luxuriant as his own. But\nwhere Murray was bald, this man's hair was as thick and black as his\nbeard. He had thrown off his helmet, so that his massive head was\noutlined against the sky. His torso was thick, his shoulders broad.\nLarge, intelligent eyes and brilliant coral skin proclaimed the man to\nbe a native of Mars.\n\nThe man's white teeth flashed brilliantly when he spoke.\n\n\"Feeling better? Man, you can feel good to be here at all! Time and\nagain have I seen Scar Balta drop 'em into that lake, but you're the\nfirst one ever to break the surface again. He gave you a break,\nthough. First time he ever gave anybody as much as a pocket\nhandkerchief to ease his fall. That lake is useful to Scar. It keeps\nthe bodies he gives it, and none ever turn up for evidence.\"\n\nMurray was still struggling with nausea. \"Want to thank you,\" he\nmanaged. \"I got it bad enough. Ow! I feel sick!\"\n\nThe Martian bestirred himself. He scraped up the ancient shingle,\nmaking a little pillow of sand for Murray's head. The Sun was already\nnearing the western horizon, and its heat was no longer excessive.\nMurray watched through half-closed lids as the big man descended a\nshort distance, returning with an armful of short, greasy shrubs. He\nbroke the shrub into bits, made a neat stack; stacked a larger ring of\nfuel around this, until he had a flat conical pile about eight inches\nhigh and two feet in diameter.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFrom a pocket safe he procured a tiny fire pellet. This he moistened\nwith saliva and quickly dropped into the center of his fuel stack. The\npellet began to glow fiercely, throwing off an intense heat. In a few\nseconds the fuel caught, burning briskly and without smoke.\n\n\"Wouldn't dare do this in the open,\" the Martian explained, \"if this\nstuff gave off any smoke at all. The pulpwood mounds down in the\nflats make a nice fire, but they smoke and leave black ashes, easy to\nsee from the sky. Now you just rest easy. You'll feel better soon as\nyou get some skitties under your belt.\"\n\nThe skitties proved to be a species of quasi-shellfish, possessing\nhemispherical houses. In lieu of the other half of their shell they\nattached themselves to sedimentary rocks. They were the only form of\nlife that had been able to adapt themselves to the chemicalization of\nthe ancient sea-remnant. The Martian had left them thin flakes of\nrock. Now he placed the shells in the red-hot coals, and in a very\nshort time the skitties were turning out, crisp and appetizing.\nFollowing his host's example, Murray speared one with the point of his\nstiletto, blew on it to cool it. It proved to be delicious, although\njust a trifle salty.\n\n\"Drink plenty water with it,\" the Martian advised him. \"Plenty more\nabout five hundred feet down. Artesian spring there. Fact is, that's\nall that keeps that lake from drying up. You ought to see the mist\nrise at night.\"\n\nMurray ate four of the skitties. Then, because the sun was getting\nready to plop down, they carefully extinguished the fire, scattering\nthe ashes. The I. F. P. agent felt greatly strengthened by his meal\nand assisted his host with the evening chores. Nightfall found them in\ntheir darkened cave, ready for an evening's yarning.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I took the liberty of examining your effects,\" the Martian began.\n\"Sort of introduced you to myself. The fact that you wore the Martian\narmy uniform was no fine recommendation to me, though I once wore it\nmyself. Your weapons I hid, except for the knife you needed to eat.\nBut you'll find them in that little hollow right over your head. The\nfact that you're an enemy of Scar Balta is enough for the present.\nThat alone is repayment for the labor of carrying you up all this\nway.\"\n\nMurray then told him of work on Mars. There was no use concealing\nanything from one who was obviously a fellow fugitive, and who might\nbe persuaded to do away with his guest, should he have strong enough\nsuspicions. He told of the war cabal, of the financial-political\noligarchy and its opposing monarchists. He related his own discovery\nand arrest; the pretended enlistment in Scar Balta's forces which\nterminated in Scar's prompt and ruthless action. When he finished he\nsensed that he had made a deep impression on his host. The latter\nspoke.\n\n\"What you have told me, Murray, relieves me very much,\" he said. \"I\nknow that we can work together. You might as well know how I came to\nbe here. Perhaps I look forty or fifty years old. Well, I'm thirty. I\nwas news director for the televisor corporations. I didn't have to be\nvery smart to realize that a lot of the stuff we were ordered to send\nout was propaganda, pure and simple. Propaganda for the war interests,\npropaganda for the financiers. Commercial propaganda too.\n\n\"Why, the stuff we put out was a crime! The service to the\nteletabloids was the worst. You know how they outstrip the news; hired\nactors take the part of personages in the news. Ever watch 'em? The\nway they enact a murder is good, isn't it?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"We got orders to bear down on your service too, the I. F. P. Your\ncrew has too many points of contact, hiking from planet to planet. The\nhigh command couldn't see things the bankers liked, I guess.\n\n\"So whenever a man of the I. F. P. figured in the news we always gave\nhim the worst of it. We hired bums to play his part, criminals,\nvicious degenerates. People believe what they see--that's the idea. I\nhad seen very few of your men but I knew we were giving them a dirty\ndeal. Orders were orders, though. We got lots of orders we didn't\nunderstand. Then secret deals were made, and those orders\ncountermanded.\n\n\"But the order against the I. F. P. remained standing, and we\ncertainly did effective work against 'em. The people had no way of\nknowing the difference, either, for the company controls all means of\ncommunication, and the I. F. P. does most of its work in out of the\nway places. Why just to show you how effective our work was--the\npeople, in a special plebiscite, voted to withdraw their support from\nthe Plutonian campaign! But that was going too far; the financiers\nquietly reversed that.\n\n\"At the same time, we got orders to glorify Wilcox, the planetary\npresident. It was Wilcox signing a bill to feed the hungry--after\ntheir property had been stripped by the taxes. It was Wilcox the\nbenevolent; Wilcox the superman. Wilcox, in carefully rehearsed\ndramatic situations, reproduced on the stereo-screens in every home.\nYou know who put over the slogan, 'Wilcox, the Solar Savior?' We did\nit. It was easy!\" He laughed shortly.\n\n\"The only time we failed was, when they wanted to end, once and for\nall, the prestige of the royal house. That was after they had bought\nthe assassination of the claimant, his wife and their son. Didn't dare\ntake Princess Sira too, because she has always been a popular darling.\nIt would have been too raw, wiping out the whole family. They left one\nclaimant, see? And then put it up to us to discredit her!\n\n\"Man! That fell down! The first attempt was very smooth, at that. But\nit brought in such a storm of condemnation they had to drop that.\n\n\"You can guess how we boys at the central office felt about it. No\nwonder we got cynical and lost all self-respect. We couldn't have\nstood it at all, but sometimes we'd put on a special party, just to\nlet off steam. Did we rip 'em up high and handsome? The more\noutrageous the flattery we sent out, disguised as news, the more\nbaldly truthful we were in those early morning rehearsals, with the\nmikes and telegs dead. Wilcox was our special meat.\n\n\"Of course, it was foolhardy. One night a mixer in the room below us\ngot his numbers mixed, killing a banquet program on a trunk channel\nand sending our outrageous burlesque out instead. When the poor fellow\ndiscovered his mistake he made for the bottom of the canal. As for me,\nI made for the desert. I never heard what became of the others, and\nthat was six years ago. I wonder if I've changed much.\"\n\n\"What's your name?\" Murray asked suddenly.\n\n\"Tuman. Nay Tuman.\"\n\n\"The others must have been caught. As for yourself, orders have been\nsent all over the solar system to kill you on sight. They hung the\nkilling of that electrician on you.\"\n\n\"That's their way!\" Nay Tuman absented gloomily. \"A price on my head.\nThey thought I'd stow away on some rocket liner, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Weren't you afraid some desert rat would give you away?\"\n\n\"No danger. They're just about all fugitives themselves. They hid me\ntill I grew this foliage. They showed me how to find food and water\nwhere seemingly there was none. The desert isn't sterile. Why, I know\nof three or four men within fifty miles of here! Sometimes they stop\nat my spring for water. As for the harness frames at the fort, those\nsojers might as well be blind, considering all they miss.\"\n\n\"You asked a while ago if you've changed much. You have. I remember\nyour picture. All of us studied it, because there's a 100,000 I. P.\ndollar reward out. You were a slim lad then, not the fuzzy bear you\nare now. How would you like to go in to Tarog with me? They seem to\nhave us licked now--but did you ever hear that the I. F. P. is most\ndangerous when it's been thoroughly licked?\"\n\n\"I don't know--I'm used to the solitude,\" Tuman demurred. \"In the city\nI'd be lost.\"\n\nBut Murray won him over. He had a persuasive way with him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe next morning they started, guiding their course by the Sun. They\nmade no attempt to travel fast, but the going was easy. Although they\nrested during the heat of the day, and buried themselves for the\nnights in the sun-warmed sand, they made about fifteen miles a day.\nThey saw no other human being. These desert dwellers did not meet for\nmere sociability.\n\nThey left the mountains on the second day, descending to the lower\nlevel of a broad, sterile plain which was studded by the low, greenish\npulp-mounds, that resembled mossy rocks more than vegetation. After\ntwo days more they came to a region where huge blocks of stone, of the\nprevailing orange or brick color, lay scattered around on the plain.\n\n\"They look good to me,\" Tuman said. \"If some patrol comes along now\nwe'll have plenty of cover, at least. This belt is a hundred miles\nwide, maybe a little more. Good hunting there. Plenty of desert hogs,\nas fat and as round as a ball of bovine butter. I can knock 'em over\nwith a rock, and you can use your neuro, in a pinch.\"\n\nThey did, in fact, succeed in capturing one of the little creatures\nsoon afterward, and, dropping a moistened fire pellet on top of a\npulp-mound, soon were roasting their meat.\n\nNot once, however, did either one relax his vigilance. Almost\nsimultaneously they discovered the little black dot that seemed to pop\nout of the irregular southern horizon. They leaped to their feet,\nkicked out the fire. They would have covered the ashes with sand but\nfor hundreds of feet in either direction there was nothing but bare\nrock.\n\n\"Never mind!\" Murray said. \"Let's make for cover. They may think it's\nan old fireplace. With rains only about once in three years that spot\nwill look like that indefinitely.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Tuman agreed, running along, \"if they didn't see the smoke!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs the craft neared they could make out the orange and green of the\nMartian army.\n\n\"From the fort,\" Murray guessed. \"Scar Balta must have had his doubts\nabout me. He ordered them out to finish the job, if necessary.\"\n\n\"It's drifting,\" Tuman observed. \"The driving tail seems to be\nmissing.\"\n\n\"Well, anyway, it's coming down, and where an army ship comes down is\nno place for us.\"\n\nThey heard the scrape of her keel as she settled down. Murray gave a\ngasp of surprise.\n\n\"Tuman,\" he muttered, \"that fellow wearing the Martian uniform is an\nI. F. P. agent named Hemingway. The uniform doesn't fit and I bet the\nman he took it from is no longer alive. Do you know the giant with\nhim?\"\n\n\"Under that dirt and blood, I'd say he's Tolto, Princess Sira's\nspecial pet. No other man of Mars could be that big! Seven or eight\nyears ago--she was just a kid, you know--she picked him up in some\nrural province. Kids just naturally do run to pets, don't they? And\nthe princess was no exception. But he looks like nobody's pet now. I'd\nrather have him peg me with his neuro, though, than to take me in his\nhands!\"\n\nThey watched as Sime and Tolto slowly walked about in widening\ncircles, and when they were sufficiently far away Murray and Tuman\nclosed in. They had no expectation of finding the ship unlocked, and\nwasted no time trying to get it. Instead they climbed a flat-topped\nblock of stone about ten feet high. From this position they could\ncommand, with Murray's neuro, anyone who might seek to enter the ship.\n\n\"These fellows are our best hope,\" Murray told Tuman. \"But we have to\nconvince 'em that we're friends first. Otherwise we're liable to be\ncold meat, and cold meat can't convince anybody. Keep your head down.\"\n\nThe necessity of lying flat, in order to keep from silhouetting\nthemselves against the sky, deprived them of the opportunity to see.\nNevertheless, they could tell, by the sound of their voices, when Sime\nand Tolto returned. When it seemed that they were directly beneath,\nMurray risked a look. There they were.\n\nMurray carefully set the little focalizer wheel for maximum diffusion.\nHe felt sure that it would not be fatal, considering the distance and\nthe physical vigor of the men he meant to hold. He pressed the\ntrigger.\n\n\"Get down quick!\" he snapped. \"I'll let up for a second; you grab\ntheir neuros.\"\n\nTuman executed the order with dispatch. Stepping back, he trained the\npistols on their late owners, while Sime and Tolto, a little dazed,\nstumbled to their feet. A man may argue, or take chances, when menaced\nby a needle-ray, but mere bravery does not count with the neuros. All\nmen's nervous systems are similar, and when nerves are stricken,\ncourage is of no avail.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n_Plot and Counter-Plot_\n\n\nAs these four men faced one another in the slanting rays of the\nsetting Sun far out on the desert, the planetary president, Wilcox,\nsat in his office in the executive palace in South Tarog, situated, as\nwere so many of the public buildings, on the banks of the canal.\n\nWilcox was in his sixties. A gray man, pedantic in his speech, his\nfeatures were strong: his nose, short and straight, somehow, expressed\nhis intense intolerance of opposition. His long, straight lower jaw\nprotruded slightly, symbolizing his tenacity, his lust for power. His\neyes, large, gray, intolerant, looked before him coldly. Wilcox was\nthe result of the union of two root-stocks of the human race, of a\nterrestrial father, a Martian mother. He had inherited the\nintelligence of both--the conscience of neither.\n\nNow he sat in a straight, severe chair, before a severe, heavy table.\nEven the room seemed to frown. Wilcox's face was free of wrinkles, yet\nit frowned too. He seemed not to see the flaming path the setting Sun\ndrew across the broad expanse of the canal, for he was thinking of\nbigger things. Wilcox was a little mad, but he was a madman of\nimagination and resource, and he was not the first one to control the\ndestinies of a world.\n\n\"Waffins!\" His voice rang out sharp and querulous. A servant,\nresplendent in the palace livery of green and orange, was instantly\nbefore him bowing low.\n\n\"Who awaits our pleasure?\"\n\n\"Scar Balta, sire,\" answered Waffins, bowing low again.\n\n\"We will see him.\"\n\nWaffins disappeared. Scar Balta came in alone, sleek as usual showing\nno trace of his irritation over his long wait. He did not even glance\nat the somber hangings that concealed a number of recesses in the\nwall. Scar knew that guards stood back of those hangings, armed with\nneuro-pistols or needle-rays as a precaution against the ever-present\nmenace of assassination. And of the loopholes back of these recesses,\nwith still other armed men, as a constant warning to any of the inner\nguards whose thoughts might turn to treachery.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nScar Balta bowed respectfully.\n\n\"Your Excellency desired to see me?\"\n\n\"I wished to see you, or I should not have had you called,\" Wilcox\nreplied irritably. \"I wish to have an explicit understanding with you\nas to our proceeding next week at our conference with the financial\ndelegates. Sit here, close to me. It is not necessary for us to shout\nour business to the world.\"\n\nBalta took the chair beside Wilcox, and they conversed in low tones.\n\n\"First of all,\" Wilcox wanted to know, \"how is your affair with the\nPrincess Sira progressing?\"\n\n\"Your Excellency knows.\" Balta began cautiously, \"that the news\nagencies have been sending out pictorial forecasts--\"\n\n\"Save your equivocation for others!\" Wilcox interrupted sharply. \"I am\naware of the propaganda work. It was by my order that the facilities\nwere extended to you. I am also aware that the princess escaped from\nJoro's palace. An amazing piece of bungling! Did she really escape or\nis Joro forwarding some plot of his own?\"\n\n\"He seems genuinely disturbed. He has spent a fortune having the canal\nsearched by divers, flying ships and surface craft. If Sira fails to\nmarry me Joro's life ambition will fail, for the hopes of the\nmonarchists will then be forever lost.\"\n\n\"True; but his Joro some larger plan? His is a mind I do not\nunderstand, and therefore I must always fear. A man with no ambition\nfor himself, but only for an abstract. It is impossible!\"\n\n\"Not impossible!\" Balta insisted. \"Joro is a strange man. He believes\nthat the monarchy would improve conditions for the people. And, Your\nExcellency, wouldn't I be a good king?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWilcox looked at him morosely. His low voice carried a chill.\n\n\"Do not anticipate events, my friend! There are certain arrangements\nto be made with the bankers regarding the election of a solar\ngovernor!\" His large gray eyes burned. \"Solar governor! Never in\nhistory has there been a governor of the entire solar system. Destiny\nshapes all things to her end, and then produces a man to fill her\nneeds!\"\n\n\"And that man sits here beside me, Balta added adroitly. Wilcox did\nnot sense the irony of the quick take-up. He had been about to\ncomplete the sentence himself. But his mind was practical.\n\n\"The bankers must be satisfied. The terrestrial war must be assured\nbefore they will lend their support.\"\n\n\"It is practically assured now,\" Balta insisted. \"Our propaganda\nbureau has been at work incessantly, and public feeling is being\nworked up to a satisfactory pitch. Only last night two terrestrial\ncommercial travelers were torn to pieces by a mob on suspicion that\nthey were spies.\"\n\n\"Good!\" Wilcox approved. \"Let there be no interruption in the work.\nOur terrestrial agents report excellent results on Earth. They\nsucceeded in poisoning the water supply of the city of Philadelphia.\nThousands killed, and the blame placed on Martian spies. Our agents\nfound it necessary to inspire a peace bloc in the pan-terrestrial\nsenate in order to keep them from declaring war forthwith. But these\nthings are of no concern to you. Have you made the necessary\narrangements with the key men of the army?\"\n\n\"I have, Your Excellency. They are chafing for action. The overt act\nwill be committed at the appointed time, and the terrestrial liner\nwill be disintegrated without trace.\"\n\n\"And have you made arrangements for the disposal of the ship's\nrecords?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Our own ship? I thought it best to have a time bomb concealed aboard.\nThat way not only the records will be destroyed but there will be no\nmen left to talk when the post-war investigating commission comes\naround.\"\n\n\"Well managed!\" Wilcox approved shortly. \"See that there is no\nfailure!\" He dismissed the young man by withdrawing to his inner self,\nwhere he rioted among stupendous thoughts.\n\nScar Balta emerged into the streets, brightly illuminated with the\ncoming of night, and his thoughts were far from easy. The absence of\nthe princess was a serious handicap--might very easily be disastrous.\nWith her consent and help it would have been so simple! The people,\nentirely unrealizing that their emotions were being directed into just\nthe channels desired, could most easily be reached through the\nprincess.\n\nFirst the war, of course, and then, when the threatened business\nuprising against financial control had been crushed, a planet-wide\nsentimental spree over the revival of the monarchy and the marriage of\nthe beautiful and popular princess. As prince consort, Scar would then\nfind it a simple matter to maneuver himself into position as authentic\nking.\n\nBut without the princess! Ah, that was something else again! For the\nfirst time in his devious and successful career, Scar Balta felt\ndistinctly unhappy. He had schemed, suffered and murdered to put\nhimself in reach of this glittering opportunity, and he would\ninevitably lose it unless he could find Sira.\n\nIn the midst of his unhappy reflections he thought of Mellie.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSira knew well that Wasil adored her. He had for her the same dog-like\ndevotion that Mellie had. She knew she could ask for his life and he\nwould give it. And what she had planned for him was almost equivalent\nto asking for his life.\n\nShe told him as much, sitting beside him on a bench in the garden. His\nsmooth coral face was alight, his large eyes inspired.\n\n\"I will do just as you have commanded me!\" he declared solemnly, and\nwould have kissed her hand.\n\n\"You must not only do it; you must keep every detail to yourself. You\nmust not even tell Mellie. Do you promise?\"\n\n\"I promise!\"\n\nShe kissed him on the forehead. \"Farewell, Wasil. I have been here two\ndays already--far longer than prudence allows. They will be here\nlooking for me. Have you any money?\"\n\nWasil produced a roll of I. P. scrip; handed it to her.\n\n\"Kiss Mellie for me,\" she called, as she slipped out of the garden.\nShe was still dressed in the coarse laborer's attire that she had\nbought on the trading boat, and mingled readily with the crowds in the\nstreets. She hoped she would not meet Mellie, for the girl's devotion\nmight outweigh her judgment.\n\nThe rest of that day Sira prowled about the city. Mingling with the\ncommon people, she came to have a new insight in their struggles,\ntheir sorrows. Passing the walls of her own palace, now locked and\nsealed, she felt, strangely, resentment that there should be such\npiled-up wealth while people all around lacked almost the necessities\nof life.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe surprised herself, also, by a changing attitude toward the life\nambition of Prince Joro. The old man's discussions of social\nconditions that could be corrected by a benevolent monarch had always\nbefore seemed to her merely academic and without great interest. Such\nco-operation as she had given him was motivated entirely by personal\nambition. Now she recalled some of Joro's theories, reviewed them in\nher mind, half consenting.\n\nAlways she would strike a barrier when she came to Scar Balta. The\nmore she thought of him the more he repelled her. She puzzled over\nthat. Scar was quite personable.\n\nTarog, every industrial city along the equatorial belt, and even the\nremotest provinces, were seething with war talk. The teletabloids at\nthe street corners always had intent audiences. Sira watched one of\nthem. Disease germs had been found in a shipment of fruit juices from\nthe Earth. The teletabloids showed, in detail, diabolical looking\nterrestrials in laboratory aprons infecting the juices. Then came\nshocking clinical views of the diseases produced. Men, on turning\naway, growled deep in their throats and women chattered shrilly. The\nparks were milling with crowds who came to hear the patriotic\nspeakers.\n\nThere was hardly anyone at the stereo-screens, where the news of real\nimportance was given.\n\n\"President Wilcox announced to-day that an interplanetary conference\nof financiers will be held in his office three days from to-day,\nbeginning at the third hour after sunrise. President Wilcox, whose\nefforts have been unremitting to prevent the war which daily seems\nmore inevitable, declared that the situation may yet be saved unless\nsome overt act occurs.\" At the same time the device showed a\nthree-dimensional picture of the planetary president, impressive,\ndominating, stern with a sternness that could mean almost anything.\n\nSira, hurrying home to an inexpensive lodging house, thought:\n\n\"Three days from to-day! I have done what I could. The hopes of the\nsolar system now rest with Wasil. I am only a helpless spectator.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTarog awaited the conference on the morrow bedecked like a bride. The\nMartian flag, orange and green, fluttered everywhere. On both sides of\nthe canal the brilliantly lighted thoroughfares were restless with\npedestrians, and the air was swarming with taxicabs. Excitement was\nuniversal, and business was good.\n\nThe glare of the twin cities could be seen far out in the cold desert.\nFour men, stumbling along wearily, occasionally estimated the distance\nwith wearied eyes and plodded onward.\n\nAfter a long silence Murray remarked:\n\n\"It's just as well that the levitators gave out when they did. We were\ndrifting mighty slow--making practically no time at all. Probably we'd\nhave been spotted if we'd gone much further.\"\n\n\"Yeh?\" Sime Hemingway conceded doubtfully. \"But they may spot us\nanyway. We have no passes, and none of us looks very pretty. As for\nTolto, we could hide a house as easy as him.\"\n\n\"But we must go on,\" said Tuman, the Martian. \"Yonder lights seem too\nbright, too numerous for an ordinary day. There's some kind of\ncelebration.\"\n\nThey trudged on for several hours more. Although weariness made their\nfeet leaden and pressed on their eyelids, they dared not halt. Each\none nursed some secret dread. Tolto thought of his princess, his child\ngoddess, and mentally fought battle with whomever stood between him\nand her. Sime and Murray saw in those lights only war, swift and\nhorrible. Tuman imagined a city full of enemies, ruthless and\npowerful.\n\nGradually, as they came closer, the lights began to go out one by one.\nThe city was going to bed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAn hour later they came to an illuminated post marking the end of a\nstreet. A teletabloid was affixed to this post, buzzing, but its\nstereo-screen blank. Murray found a coin, inserted it in the slot.\n\n\"Marriage of the Princess Sira and Scar Balta will be held immediately\nafter the financial congress,\" the machine intoned briskly, and in\ntime with its running comments it began to display pictures.\n\nSime, watching indifferently, caught his breath. It seemed to him that\nhe knew this girl, who appeared to be walking toward him up a stately\ngarden alley. She came steadily forward with a queenly, effortless\nstride. And now it seemed as if she had seen him, for she turned and\nlooked straight into his eyes. It seemed that her expression changed\nfrom laughing to pleading. And he recognized the girl with the\nstiletto whom he had caught in his hotel room.\n\nHe said nothing, however. He could hardly explain the feeling of\nsadness that came over him. He stood silent, while the others\ncommented excitedly over the overshadowing war news.\n\n\"It's all in the box,\" Tuman said gloomily. \"Many times I've helped\ncook up something like this. The boys in the central offices are\nlaughing, or swearing, as the cast may be. The poor devils don't own\ntheir own souls, if they're equipped with any. I'd rather be here,\nexpecting to be thrown into a cell by daylight!\" He shivered in the\nnight chill.\n\nThey ran into a little luck when they needed it most. A roving taxi\nswooped down upon them, hailed them for fares. They flew the rest of\nthe way in. Their luck held. A city policeman, noting their stumbling\nwalk as they lurched into a cheap hotel, did not trouble them for\ntheir passes. He had seen many such men that night, soldier and\ncivilian, with clothes bloody and torn. The excitement of the day,\ncoupled with the fact that nearly everyone carried arms, had led to\nnumerous fights, not a few of which ended fatally.\n\n\"Merclite!\" grinned the policeman, suppressing a hiccup of his own.\n\"And besides, that big 'un would make two of me.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n_One Thousand to One_\n\n\nThe scheme that Sira had imparted to Wasil was simple--simple and\ndirect. Moreover, it was sure, provided it succeeded. Its execution\nwas something else again. Its chances were, mathematically expressed,\nabout as follows:\n\nIf every single detail worked as expected, a great and smashing\nsuccess. Ratio: 1:1,000.\n\nIf one single detail failed, immediate and certain death for Wasil.\nRatio: 1,000:1.\n\nThe princess knew that the power of Wilcox, his supporting oligarchy\nand the interplanetary bankers, was all based on the skilful use of\npropaganda. If the people of Mars and of Earth knew the forces that\nwere influencing them, their revulsion would be swift and terrible.\nThere would be no war. There would be events painful and disastrous to\ntheir present rulers, but a great betterment of humanity's condition.\n\nThe key to the situation was the news monopoly, the complete control\nof all broadcasting--of the stereo-screens, the teletabloids--that\ncolored all events to suit the ends of the ruling group. The people of\nMars as well as of Earth were capable of intelligent decision, of\nstraight thinking, but they rarely had an opportunity to learn the\ntruth.\n\nThey had now, by a knowing play on their emotions, directed by\npsychologists, been wrought to a point of frenzy where they demanded\nwar. Their motives were of the highest in many individuals--pure\npatriotism, the desire to make the solar system safe for civilization.\nThe bright, flaming spirit of self-sacrifice burned clear above the\nhaze and smoke of passion.\n\nWhat would happen if all these eager millions of two neighboring\nplanets were to learn the true state of affairs? Sira knew what\ntranspired in those secret conventions, when double guards stood at\nall doors and at the infrequent windows; when all communication was\ncut off and the twin lenses of the telestereos and the microphones\nwere dead. Prince Joro had told her, with weary cynicism. But Joro had\nalso told her that the oligarchs guarded this vital and vulnerable\npoint with painstaking care.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSira had reached inside their first defense, however. Wasil was loyal\nto his salt, but he had both loyalty and affection for Princess Sira.\nAs the day of the interplanetary financial conference leaped into\nbeing, he was on his way to the executive hall that lay resplendently\non the south canal bank, ready to lay down his life.\n\nThe hall proper was really only the west wing of the magnificent,\nhigh-arched building. Its brilliant, polished metal facade reflected\nthe light of the rising Sun redly. The east wing, besides housing\nvarious minor executive offices, also contained the complicated\napparatus for handling the propaganda broadcastings. On the roof,\ntowering high into the air, was a huge, globular structure, divided\ninto numerous zones, from which were sent various wave bands to the\nnews screens both on Mars and on Earth. The planetary rulers had taken\nno chances of tampering with their propaganda. The central offices,\nwhere news and propaganda were dramatized, were in another building,\nbut as everything from that source had to pass the reviewing officer,\na trusted member of the oligarchy himself, in his locked and guarded\noffice, this did not introduce any danger of the wrong information\ngoing out to the public.\n\nWhen Wasil reached the broadcasting plant, he was admitted by four\narmed guards. He locked the door behind him, to find his associates\nalready busy, testing circuits and apparatus. Stimson, the chief\nengineer, was sitting at his desk studying orders.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA few minutes later he called the men to him. There were three others\nbesides Wasil: young Martians, keen, efficient, and, like most\ntechnies, loyal to the government that employed them.\n\n\"Sure are careful to-day,\" Stimson grunted, scratching his snow-white\nhair, which was stiffly upstanding and showed a coral tinge from his\nscalp. \"Must be mighty important to get this out right. Wilcox\npersonally wrote the order. If any man fumbles to-day, it's the polar\npenal colony for him!\" The Sun-loving old Martian shivered.\n\n\"And here's another bright idea. Only one man's to be allowed in the\nplant after the circuits are all tested! How'n the name of Pluto will\nhe handle things if a fuse blows? But what do they care about that!\nWe're technies! We're supposed to know everything, and never have\nanything go wrong!\"\n\n\"But why only one man?\" cried Scarba, one of the associate engineers.\n\"It's asking too much! I'll not take it on, far as I'm concerned. My\nresignation will be ready soon's I can get a blank!\"\n\n\"I too! I'm with you, Scarba!\" \"We work like dogs to get everything in\nfirst-line condition, and then--\" The hard-working and uncomplaining\ntechnies were outspoken in their resentment.\n\n\"Oh, I see your point,\" Stimson agreed. \"I could stand Balta, but\nWilcox is just one too many for me. But do you boys think for one\nminute we could get away with a strike?\" He laughed angrily. \"I can\nremember when the technies were able to demand their guild rights. But\nyou boys weren't even born then. Now, let's get this straight:\n\n\"We are going to do just as we are told. Wilcox, of course, never\nexplains an order, but the reason for having only one operator on the\njob is simply to concentrate responsibility on that one man. There\nwill be no excuse if he fails. Before the convention starts, and after\nit is over, there will be a message to send out. The convention itself\nwill be secret, as usual. During the convention, there will be some\nkind of filler stuff from the central office.\"\n\n\"Yeh!\" snorted one of the men. \"That's the dope, all right. One of us\nis stuck, but if it's me I'll walk out and head for the desert.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nStimson looked at him with a sardonic smile. \"I forgot to mention: the\ndoors will be locked and barred, and of course there's no such thing\nas windows.\"\n\nWasil whistled. \"They're sure careful. Well, Stimson. I haven't a\nthing to do all day. I'll take it on.\"\n\nThey all looked at him, not sure that they had heard him right.\n\n\"What's the matter, sonny?\" Stimson said slowly. \"Too much Merclite\nlast night? You're shaking!\"\n\n\"It's an opening!\" Wasil insisted.\n\n\"An opening to tramp ice at the pole for the rest of your life!\"\n\n\"All right. I'll chance it!\"\n\nThey consented, without very much argument, to let Wasil have the\ndangerous responsibility. At 2:30, two and a half hours after sunrise\nby the Martian reckoning, he signed a release acknowledging all\ncircuits to be in proper order, and was locked behind the heavy doors,\nalone with a maze of complicated apparatus and cables that filled the\nlarge room from floor to ceiling.\n\nNow it was done! Chance had thrown Wasil into a position where he\ncould, without great danger of failure, carry out his plan. But at the\nsame time things had so fallen that he, Wasil, must now die,\nregardless of the outcome!\n\nIf he succeeded in broadcasting the proceedings of the convention, and\nif they had the effect of arousing the public against Wilcox, there\nwould still be no escape for Wasil. Wilcox, or Scar Balta, would come\nstraight for this prison, neuro-pistol or needle-ray in hand!\n\nEven if he should fail, death would be his portion for the attempt.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSo thinking, Wasil sat down and carefully re-checked the circuits. The\nfiller broadcast from central office must be sent to the twin cities\nof Tarog. Otherwise the convention would learn too soon what was\nhappening, and would interrupt its business. The thousands who waited\noutside on the broad terraces must be regaled with entertainment, as\nhad been originally planned.\n\nBut as for the rest of Mars, and Earth, they would get the truth for\nonce. Those bankers would speak frankly, in the snug isolation of the\nhall. No supervision here. Conventions, empty politeness, would be\nforgotten. Sharp tirades, biting facts, threats, veiled and open,\nwould pass across the table between these masters of money and men.\n\nBut this time they would be pitilessly bared to the worlds!\n\nFeverishly, Wasil inspected the repeater. It was a little-used device\nthat would, an hour or two later, as desired, give out the words and\npictures fed into it. Although Tarog would not learn the convention's\nsecrets as quickly as the rest of Mars, or Earth, Tarog would learn.\nWasil threw over the links and clamped down the bolts with a grunt of\nsatisfaction. When a man is about to die, he wants to do his last job\nwell.\n\nSuddenly a red light glowed, and a voice spoke.\n\n\"Special broadcast. Tarog circuit only!\"\n\n\"Mornin', Lennings,\" Wasil remarked to the face in the screen. \"All\nset? Go ahead.\"\n\nThe central office man held up a thick bundle of I. P. scrip, smiled\npleasantly, saying:\n\n\"Somebody in North or South Tarog, or in the surrounding territory, is\ngoing to be 100,000 I. P. dollars richer by to-morrow. How would you\nlike to have 100,000 dollars? You all would like this reward. It\nrepresents the price of a snug little space cruiser for your family; a\nnew home on the canal; maybe an island of your own. It would take you\non a trip to the baths of Venus and leave you some money over. Of\ncourse you all want this reward!\n\n\"Now, if you'll excuse me a moment--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe man's picture faded, and the screen glowed with the life and\nbeauty of Princess Sira--Sira, smiling and alluring.\n\n\"You all know this young lady,\" the announcer's voice went on. \"The\nbeloved and lovable Sweetheart of Mars, the bride of Scar Balta--\"\n\nThe Martian's sleek and well-groomed head appeared beside that of the\ngirl.\n\n\"--Scar Balta, whose services to Mars have been great beyond his\nyears; who, in the threatening war with Earth, would be one of our\ngreatest bulwarks of security.\"\n\nThe announcer's face appeared again, stern and sorrowful.\n\n\"A great disaster has befallen these lovers--and all the world loves a\nlover, you know. Some thugs, believed by the police to be terrestrial\nspies, have kidnapped the princess from the palace of her uncle,\nPrince Joro of Hanlon. It is believed that they had drugged her and\nhypnotized her, so that she has forgotten her duty to her lover and\nher country.\"\n\nThe green light flashed, and Wasil broke the circuit. The central man\nlingered a moment, favoring Wasil with a long wink.\n\n\"What a liar you're getting to be!\" Wasil remarked coldly. But the\ncentral man, not offended, laughed.\n\nSo they were offering a reward! And urging further treachery as an act\nof patriotism! Wasil was not too much excited, however. The disguise\nthe princess had chosen would probably serve her well. Besides, she\nhad promised to keep in retirement as much as possible.\n\n_Clack! Clack!_ The electrically controlled lock of the door was\nopening. Only Wilcox knew the wave combination. Wasil felt a chill of\napprehension as the door opened and Scar Balta strode in. He was fully\narmed, dressed in the military uniform; but the former colonel was now\nwearing on his shoulder straps the concentric rings denoting a\ngeneral's rank.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n_Giant Against Giant_\n\n\nAlthough Princess Sira had promised to keep out of the way, she could\nnot resist the powerful attraction of the executive hall, in which, on\nthis day, the fate of two planets was to be decided. As the crowds of\npeople began to drift toward the hall, she joined them, still dressed\nin her laboring man's shapeless garments, the broad sun-helmet hiding\nher face effectively. Her long, black hair was concealed under the\nclothing. Having nearly been drawn into a brawl the day before, she\nnow carried a stained but still very serviceable short sword that she\nhad purloined from a merclite-drunken reveler in a gutter.\n\nThousands were already on the terraces surrounding the government\nbuildings. They were milling about, for it was still too soon after\nthe night's chill to sit down or lie on the rubbery red sward. Taxis\nwere bringing swarms over the canal from North Tarog, and water\nvehicles were crossing over in almost unbroken lines.\n\nAlready the merclite vendors were busy, making their surreptitious way\nfrom group to group, selling the highly intoxicating and legally\nproscribed gum that would lift the users from the sordid, miserable\nplane of their daily existence to exalted, reckless heights.\n\nWar vessels now began to course overhead, their solid, heavily plated\nhulls glinting dully in the sun. Their levitator helices moaned\ndismally, and as their long, slanting shadows slid over the assembled\nthousands, it seemed that they cast a prophetic pall; that there was a\nhush of foreboding.\n\nBut the psychological expert high in a nearby tower immediately noted\nthe slump in the psycho-radiation meter whose trumpet-shaped antenna\npointed downward. At the turn of the dial the air was filled with\nthrobbing martial music, and the expert noted with contemptuous\nsatisfaction that the needle now stood even higher than before.\n\nSira, caught like all the rest of the people in that stirring flood of\nmusic, felt her own pulse leap. But she thought:\n\n\"This is the day! Wasil, could I only be with you!\"\n\nShe thought sadly of Joro, whose shrewd observations and counsel she\nmissed more than she had ever thought possible.\n\n\"Poor, dear Joro! You would be a better king than any man you could\never find! I wish I could have done as you wished me to.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a stir near the main entrance of the hall. A large private\nyacht was slowly descending. She was bedecked with the green and gold\nbunting of the terrestrial government, the green and orange of Mars.\nHer hull glittered goldenly.\n\n\"Back!\" shouted the captain of a Martian guard detail, the soldiers\nrunning with pennant-decked ropes looping after them. The crowd surged\nagainst the barrier, but more guards were sent out as reinforcements,\nuntil they had cleared a space for the ship and a lane to the hall\nentrance.\n\n\"Mars greets the distinguished guests from our sister planet!\" boomed\nthe giant loudspeaker in the tower. Immediately afterward came the\nstrains of the song--\"Terrestria--Fair Green Terrestria\"--in a rushing\ntorrent of sound. But the frank and fluent melody was strangely\ndistorted, with unpleasant minor turns and harsh whisperings of\nmenace, and the tower psychologist noted a further rise of the needle.\n\nThere was a diversion of interest now. The mob of first arrivals, as\nwell as the ever-freshening stream of newcomers, was moving toward the\nteletabloids and the more conservative stereo-screens. On this\noccasion they were both carrying the same message, however. Sira heard\nthe propaganda division's latest fabrication about her alleged\nkidnaping by terrestrial agents. She needed no radiation meter to tell\nher of the intense wave of hatred for the Earth that swept over the\ndensely packed area. And this was followed by another emotion--a wave\nof cupidity--set up by the offer of 100,000 I. P. dollars reward for\nher return. She saw about her faces greedy, faces wistful, even\ncompassionate faces. But outnumbering them by far were faces set in\ntruculent mold.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSira moved restlessly from place to place, feeling more deeply\ndepressed with every moment. She felt as if she had been left entirely\nout of life, friendless, alone. Among all these thousands she had no\nfriend. It seemed to her that never before had there been such a\npaucity of monarchists. Sharp-featured, with a wire-drawn manner of\nefficiency and resolution about them, they had constituted almost\nanother race among this practically enslaved people, maintaining for\nthemselves a tolerable position despite the opposition of the\noligarchy. Now, however, they seemed to have vanished. All that\nmorning Sira had not seen one. She would not have disclosed her\nidentity, but it would have been comforting to see one of those\nfriends of old.\n\nShe was stopped by a jam. Looking between the bodies of two large and\nsweaty men, she realized that someone was standing on a surveyor's\nmarking block, delivering a speech.\n\n\"The great Pantheus has so decreed it,\" the speaker was shouting in a\ncracked voice that at times dribbled into a whine. \"We must shake off\nforever this menace from the green planet--this planet dominated by\nwicked women.\n\n\"Oh, my friends, last night they came to me in dreams, these pale\nwomen of the green star. They tempted me and they mocked me. They laid\ntheir cold hands on my throbbing brow, and their cold hands burned me!\n\n\"Oh great Pantheus! How I have suffered! The creatress who in her\nmalice created this wicked world beyond the gulf--\"\n\nThe Martians were entertained by the quavering denunciation. Some\ngrinned broadly at one another; others placed their thumbs in their\nears and wiggled their fingers. But the old man continued. Finally,\ntwo of the foremost spectators, sensing the tiny body crowded between\nthem, stepped aside.\n\n\"Don't miss this, my little man. Listen, and maybe you will laugh\nyourself a little bigger.\" He gave Sira a gentle shove, so that she\nalmost stumbled over the block on which the speaker was standing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd that old man suddenly stopped talking, so that his toothless mouth\nsucked in, then stood agape. The rheumy eyes rolled, and a wisp of\ndirty gray hair strayed across his gnarled face. He lifted a shaking\nhand, pointed a knotty finger.\n\n\"There she is!\" he croaked. \"There she is! I claim--\"\n\n\"There she is!\" guffawed a tipsy merclite chewer. \"The creatress, come\nto punish you! Cut off his nose, O creatress, and stuff it into his\nmouth!\"\n\nThere were shouts of laughter, a surge to see better.\n\n\"No! No! I, Deacon Homms, claim the reward!\" the old man screamed.\n\"She is the princess; I know her. She came out of the canal to tempt\nme! She is the Princess Sira. Now shall I at last enter the Palace of\nJoys! I claim the 100,000 dollars!\"\n\nBut he still had to catch Sira. The crowd, suddenly sensing that this\nold fanatic might be telling the truth, rushed in savagely, each eager\nto seize the prize, or at least to establish some claim to a share of\nthe award. Men and women went down, to be trampled mercilessly.\nInevitably they got in one another's way, and soon swords were rising\nredly, falling again.\n\n\"Guards! Guards! A riot!\" Some were fleeing the scene; others rushing\nin, grateful for the opportunity to expend excess pugnacity. A fresh\nplatoon of soldiers tumbled out of a kiosk leading to an underground\nbarracks like ants out of a disturbed nest. They deployed, holding\ntheir neuro-pistols before them, focalizers set for maximum\ndispersion, therefore non-fatal--merely of paralyzing intensity. Some\nof the rioters now turned to run, but others persisted, willing to be\nrendered unconscious, just so it would be near the valuable princess.\n\nA few moments later the captain of the guard surveyed the mass of\nparalysed bodies and the sword-slashed corpses, all intermingled.\n\n\"What's this all about?\" he demanded of a scarred, evil-looking fellow\nwho was the first to rise to his elbow.\n\n\"The Princess Sira! I claim the reward. In there! She stood right\nthere!\"\n\n\"Get out, you galoon!\" the captain growled, knocking the fellow\nunconscious with the heavy barrel of his neuro. \"Sort 'em out there.\nMoggins, Schkamitch. On the double. You will share, according to\nrank.\"\n\nBut eagerly as they searched, they did not find Sira. Creeping between\nthe legs of the maddened reward seekers, she had fought clear, had\ngained the shelter of a tall, red conical tree whose closely laced\nbranches pressed her to the ground, clinging to the greasy trunk.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe realized that her sanctuary was none too secure. There would\nsurely be a methodical search after the first excitement, and she\nwould be discovered. She had lost her sun-helmet, but nevertheless she\nmust risk making a break. A large proportion of the people were\nwearing such helmets. Perhaps she could snatch one.\n\nBut before such an opportunity came, she saw a chance to dash to a\nnearby clump of shrubbery. On the other side was a long hedge, leading\nto an alley back of a group of warehouses. If she could gain this\nalley, she felt sure she would be safe for the time being.\n\nAll over the park, which was thirty or forty acres in extent, there\nwere minor riots, as some unfortunate was mistaken for the princess\nand blindly struggled for.\n\nSira lost no time. She scuttered along the hedge like a frightened\nkangrat. But as she crossed a small open space, a stentorian voice\nshouted:\n\n\"There she is! That's her! The princess!\"\n\nOut of the corner of her eye she saw him, running toward her\nlumberingly, his great arms outspread. Tuman had been wrong in saying\nthat on all of Mars there was no man as big as Tolto. This one was,\nand he looked more formidable. Instead of Tolto's normally\ngood-natured face, this one looked like an enraged terrestrial\ngorilla, although at the moment it was really expressing joy and\neagerness.\n\nSeveral other men joined the chase, and then scores. They were fleeter\nof foot than the ape-man, but as they passed him in the narrow alley\nhe smashed them to the pavement with casual blows of his terrifying\nhands. Thereafter he was undisputedly in the lead; the others content\nto follow in his rear, although many were armed, and the giant was\nnot.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis was an advantage to Sira. The whole mob was slowed by the\nlumbering pace of the ape-man, and she was able to keep in the lead\nwithout difficulty. Several times some of her pursuers ran ahead by\nother routes, intent on snatching her into some doorway. But each time\nshe slashed at them with her sword, springing past.\n\nShe had not run very far when her fear of another danger was realized.\nThere was a high, keen whistle overhead, and a scouting police car\nflashed near. Under the neuro-pistols both hounds and hare would be\nparalyzed, and she would be easily taken. Sira longed for one of these\nhandy weapons herself, but they were too expensive: she had been\nunable to secure one.\n\nNow the police car was coming back. The sliding forward door was\ndrawn back, and a man was leaning out, neuro alert. Judging the\ndistance expertly, he pulled the trigger, and a hundred men fell\nunconscious.\n\n\"Got 'em!\" he snapped over his shoulder. \"The princess as well. Down\nquick!\"\n\nSira, spared because of the officer's unwillingness to take a chance\non injuring her, leaped through a gap in a wall and sprinted through a\ngarden smothered with thick, leathery-leaved weeds, some of them\nhigher than her head. She almost laughed with relief, but as she\nflitted around the corner of a house toward the street she saw the\ngorilla faced giant again in pursuit, and beyond the garden wall the\npolice ship was just settling to the ground.\n\nIt just seemed to be raining giants that day. Sira ran out of a narrow\ngate at the front of the house into the street, to be stopped by a\ntremendous human framework as solid and unyielding as a mountain. She\nstepped back, drew her sword--\n\n\"Softly! Softly!\" a rumbling bass implored. \"Doesn't the Princess Sira\nrecognize her servant, Tolto?\"\n\n\"Tolto!\" All at once the tautness went out of her, and Sira leaned\nagainst the wall, divided between laughing and crying.\n\n\"Tolto and his good friends were looking for you,\" the big man rumbled\nanxiously. \"The teletabloids said there was a riot coming--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe got no further. The gorilla-faced pursuer catapulted himself\nsideways through the portal, being too wide to go through in the\nregular way. He emitted a raucous shout of triumph:\n\n\"I got her! It's her, all right! I claim--\"\n\nAs he reached out his enormous sun-blackened arm there was a thud\nthat seemed to shake the ground. Instantly enraged, the man's little\nred-rimmed eyes jerked quietly to the dealer of that shocking blow.\nThen the conical little head sank between the bulging shoulders, the\nlong, thick arms bowed outward, and the ape-man launched himself at\nTolto.\n\nThat was a battle! On the one side devotion, simple-minded loyalty and\na fighting heart in a body of such mechanical perfection as Mars had\nnever seen before or since. On the other side a primal beast, just as\nhuge, rage-driven, atavistic, savage.\n\nFists as large as an average man's head, or larger, crashed against\nunprotected face and body. Gigantic muscles rippled and crackled.\nBlows echoed from wall to house and seemed to thud against the hearts\nof the spectators.\n\nIt was as if time and memory had come to a standstill. The present was\nnot, nor present ambitions and duties. The soldiers came plunging out\ninto the street, swords in their hands, but they stopped to watch.\nSime, Murray and Tuman, used to instant and automatic battle, watched.\nA struggle so titanic, by tacit, by unconsidered consent, must be left\nto decide its own course.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTolto seemed to be slowly gaining an advantage. During his novitiate\nas a palace guard the other men had instructed him in the science of\ntheir pastime-fighting. Although he scorned to guard against the blows\nof his savage antagonist, he placed his own punches more shrewdly,\nmore effectively. The ape-faced one, through a red film, sensed that\nhe was being beaten, and that this fight would end in death.\n\nSuddenly he changed his tactics. Rushing in, he threw his arms around\nTolto's great torso. He opened his jaws, and his long yellow fangs\nbit into the flesh of Tolto's shoulder.\n\nTolto, taken slightly by surprise, met this new menace promptly.\nPlacing his powerful forearm against the battered, hairy face, he\nattempted to bend the head back. But it was so small, in proportion,\nand so slippery with blood, that he was unable to dislodge it.\n\nSo Tolto matched brute strength against brute strength. His arms\nencircled his enemy's body, and the tremendous muscles of his\nshoulders and body began to arch.\n\nSo they stood poised for a few seconds, as if on the brink of\neternity.\n\n\"Go-o-o-wie!\" exclaimed one of the soldiers, awed.\n\nSlowly, like the agonizingly slow plastic creep of metal under great\npressure, the gorilla-faced giant was yielding. His dark skin became\nmottled. His breath came gaspingly. His rope-knotted arms slipped a\nlittle.\n\nBut it was not in him to surrender, which might still have saved his\nlife. With a vicious twisting motion of his head he tried to drag his\nfangs through the thick muscles of Tolto's shoulder. The wound began\nto bleed more freely, choking the savage at each labored breath.\n\nNow Tolto began to walk forward. Always his antagonist had to yield a\nlittle, unwillingly, grudgingly, just enough to keep the paralyzing\npressure on his spine from becoming unbearable. And slowly,\ninexorably, Tolto followed. His arms tightened. His leg slipped\nsuddenly between the ape-faced man's supports. Tolto grunted. The\nsound seemed to labor upward from his innermost being, his body's\nprotest as he called upon it for its last reserve of strength.\n\nLike an echo, there was a dull crack, a brief, agonized moan from the\nape-faced one; and the savage, unknown giant slumped to the pavement,\ndead with a broken back. Tolto staggered to the wall, breathing\ndeeply.\n\n\"Man, what a fight! What a _fight_!\" The young Martian captain passed\na shaking hand over his face. The battle had stirred him more deeply\nthan he wanted to admit. But in a few seconds he came out of his\nmental maze.\n\n\"Attention! All right, men, you're under arrest. As for the girl--\"\n\n\"As for the girl,\" came a clear feminine voice, as Sira stepped out\nfrom the shelter of a buttress some dozen feet away, \"--the girl took\nadvantage of your preoccupation to relieve you of your neuros. As you\nsee I have two of them in my hand. The rest of them are over by that\nwall. No! Don't try to rush! You are welcome to your swords, but they\nare useless here.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\"_He Must Be a Man of Earth_\"\n\n\nFriend and foe looked stupefied. But they were used to the give and\ntake of battle. That this girl should disarm a detachment of soldiers\nwhile they and their own men were absorbed in such a common thing as a\nfight struck them as humorous. They laughed.\n\n\"This is a better break then we deserve,\" Sime said, grinning with a\ntrace of sheepishness. \"Captain, you take your men across the street\nand hold 'em there. We're going to borrow your car. No funny stuff!\"\nCivilians were flooding into the streets. There would soon be a mob.\n\n\"We will not,\" replied the captain, \"try any funny stuff. Some day, my\nfriend, I hope to open you up with my sword,\" he added.\n\n\"By all means,\" Sime agreed pleasantly. \"My time is pretty well\noccupied, but there's no telling when I may meet you again, in my\nbusiness. Good day, Captain!\"\n\nTuman stayed at the front gate with his neuro while the others\nstruggled through the weedy garden to the police ship in the alley,\nrejoining them as they were ready to rise.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA crowd had gathered. If they wondered at the appearance of these\nragged, scarred and bewhiskered men; at sweat and blood-covered giant\nTolto; the obviously high-bred girl in the laboring man's garments,\nthey wisely refrained from comment or action, in deference to the\nneuros with which the party was bristling.\n\nOnce inside and safely in the air, they had time to breathe. Murray,\nwith a gallantry that sat ill on the scarecrow figure he was, cleared\nmatters up a trifle.\n\n\"Princess Sira? As I thought. Princess, or Your Highness, to be\nformal, I am your humble and disreputable servant, Lige Murray, of the\nInterplanetary Flying Police. Likewise this gentleman behind the\nbrush--Sime Hemingway. You know Tuman? You've missed something, Your\nHighness! And Tolto! Lucky man!\"\n\nSira recovered quickly from her reaction following the fight. She\nfound a first-aid kit, bandaged Tolto's wounded shoulder skilfully and\nquickly. She had given no sign of recognition as Sime awkwardly bowed,\nduring Murray's introduction, but now, as Sime held a roll of bandage\nfor her, she gave him a sidewise look, agleam with mischief.\n\n\"But I have decided to remit the punishment--the sentence I passed on\nyou, Mr. Hemingway,\" she said, her sweet, child-like face innocent.\n\n\"What punishment?\" Sime gasped.\n\n\"Why, the punishment of death! For kissing me that night!\" she\nlaughed, turning her back.\n\nMurray was heading back for the government park. It was a short\ndistance with the police car. Soon the broad grounds, with their\nscattered, magnificent buildings, lay below them. But the parks were\nstrangely bare of living creatures. Here and there lay the bodies of\nmen or women.\n\n\"Something's happened!\" Murray shouted excitedly. \"Look out!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe swerved the ship sharply. They escaped damage as an atomic bomb,\nunskilfully aimed, exploded far to one side.\n\n\"Funny thing, firing on a police car,\" Sime puzzled. \"They might have\ngot news from that detachment we grounded, but how do they know this\nisn't some other police or military car?\"\n\n\"Those aren't soldiers,\" Murray decided. \"There's been a riot, and\nsome civilian's got hold of an ato-projector.\"\n\n\"I know what's happened!\" Sira exclaimed suddenly. \"Wasil--a\ntechnie--has managed to broadcast the secret session! That upset their\npsychology. Oh!\" Her face was alight, and she threw up her arms in\necstasy. As quickly she subsided, and tears came to her eyes.\n\n\"Wasil!\" she cried. \"If he is dead, Mellie will never forgive me!\"\n\n\"Where is this technie?\" Sime asked bruskly.\n\n\"In the broadcast room. But they have probably killed him.\"\n\n\"Never can be sure. Head her smack for the main entrance, Murray!\"\n\nMurray threw the car into a steep dive, and the hall portal rushed up\nto meet them. A soldier came partially out of concealment, waved a\nsignal. Murray paid him no heed.\n\nThey struck with a crash. The stout car crushed through the glittering\ndoors of metal and glass, and before the fragments fell the four men\nwere in the thick of short, sharp and decisive battle. Their neuros\nhissed venomously, spanged as they met opposing beams. And the\nprincess, struggling through the wreckage, wept tears of rage as the\ncoarse fabric of her clothing caught, entangled hopelessly, and held\nher.\n\n\"Something queer!\" Murray said, as they halted for breath after\nrouting what little opposition they had encountered. \"Maybe it's a\ntrap. But what an expensive trap for somebody! Where's this\nbroadcasting plant?\"\n\n\"This way!\" Tuman called eagerly. \"Maybe we can still save the poor\nfellow who turned the trick. Broadcast the secret sessions! Don't tell\nme that little girl isn't fit to rule!\"\n\nThe heavy metal doors were open, and they hurried in. But Tolto,\nnoting that the princess had not followed, hurried out in search for\nher.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSime stumbled over a body. It had been a dark, sleek, youngish man. A\njagged burn on his throat told of the needle-ray. \"Who's this fellow,\nMurray?\"\n\nMurray glanced at the body. He smiled a brief smile of satisfaction.\n\n\"That's Scar Balta. Got what's coming to him at last. Help me with\nthis bird: he's still alive. Cold, though!\"\n\n\"Got a shot of neuro. Could this be the technie?\"\n\nSime found a fountain of water. He filled a cup, dashed it over the\nstill face. The shock made the man's lips move.\n\n\"Mellie, I did it!\" he whispered.\n\n\"Who's Mellie?\" Sime asked.\n\n\"Mellie? Seems to me the princess mentioned her name, This is her\nbrother. He's the right guy! Take it easy, brother!\"\n\nBut Wasil was able to sit up.\n\n\"I sure fooled him!\" he gasped. \"Mixed up the circuits. Scar Balta\nsat right here while I broadcast the secret sessions, and he was\nwatching a lot o' haywah in the control screen.\n\n\"When Wilcox got word from outside he knew he was done. He thought\nScar'd double-exed him, so came here in person and gave him the\nneedle-ray.\"\n\nDespite his nausea, Wasil looked happy.\n\n\"Wilcox tried for me, but I dodged back of those frames. So he tried\nfor me with the neuro. The mob was getting wild outside; there was--\"\n\nHe could not finish. There was an explosion that shook the building to\nits foundations. Tolto came running in. Sira close after him:\n\n\"Joro is coming. Joro has detonated the warships. The hall guards have\nsurrendered. The council is locked up. It can't escape!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEvents were transpiring too fast for comprehension. It was several\ndays later, on a bench in Prince Joro's palace grounds, that Sira\nsummed it up for Sime Hemingway.\n\n\"I'm going to accept the throne!\" she said. \"I'm going to be a real\nqueen. Joro has convinced me that it will be a real service to Mars.\nThe dear old man has schemed and worked so long, so unselfishly.\"\n\n\"Yeh, and he wasn't afraid to fight!\" Sime added admiringly. \"When he\ncame charging out of those ships with his gang of monarchists, swords\nflashing, it was a pretty sight to see. And when they closed in on\nthat gang of cheap politicians! Talk about rats in a corner!\"\n\n\"The prince can fight with his brains as well as with his sword.\" Sira\nsubmitted. \"The whole thing would have been hopeless, if he hadn't\ninvented the detonating ray that disposed of the warships. You\nremember those heavy explosions, shortly after we dropped in the\nhall, as one might say? Those were the last of them.\"\n\nA silence fell between them, and Sime was now conscious of the\nfragile-seeming, so deceiving beauty of this Martian girl. Something\nhad come between them, stripped away the masculine frankness that had\nexisted during their short and dangerous time together. Perhaps it was\nthe softly revealing drape of the thread-of-gold robe she was\nwearing--true queenly garb, donned by her for the first time.\n\n\"There is one requirement that Joro insists on,\" Sira said in a low\nvoice.\n\n\"What's that?\" asked Sime, marveling that such transparently pink\nfingers should handle a sword so well.\n\n\"He says that I must choose a mate, to insure the stability of the\nroyal house.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt seemed to Sime that this announcement gave him a pang out of all\nproportion.\n\n\"That should be easy,\" he managed. \"Every Martian is crazy about you.\"\n\n\"He may not be a Martian. He must be a man of Earth,\" Sira stated\nfirmly.\n\n\"Is that so?\" Sime asked, genuinely surprised. \"Why does Joro insist\non that?\"\n\n\"It is not Joro who insists. It is myself.\"\n\nSime found himself looking into eyes filled with shy pleading. He\ncould not, would not, for all of the solar system, have committed the\nunpardonable affront of rejecting the love so frankly offered. And yet\nhe did not know how to accept this miracle. He did it clumsily,\nhaltingly disclosing the secret recesses of his own heart and what had\ntranspired there since the night he had taken the knife away from her\nand kissed her.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Martian Cabal, by Roman Frederick Starzl\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE MARTIAN CABAL ***\n\n***** This file should be named 29437.txt or 29437.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/9/4/3/29437/\n\nProduced by Sankar Viswanathan, Greg Weeks, and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
