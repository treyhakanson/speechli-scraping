That's what they've calculated now.\"\n\n\"And how far is it away?\" Anita asked. \"I heard a newscaster say\nyesterday....\"\n\n\"Newscasters!\" Venza broke in scornfully. \"Say, you can take what they\ntell you about any danger or trouble and cut it in half; and even then\nyou'll be on the gloomy side. See here, Gregg Haljan.\"\n\n\"I'm not giving you newscasters' blare,\" I retorted. Venza's\nextravagant vehemence was always refreshing. The Venus girl glared at\nme. I added: \"Anita mentioned newscasters; I didn't.\"\n\nAnita was in no mood for smiling. \"Tell us, Gregg.\" She sat upright\nand tense, her chin cupped in her hands. \"Tell us.\"\n\n\"For a fact, they don't know much about it yet. You can call it a\nplanet, a wanderer.\"\n\n\"I should say it was a wanderer!\" Venza exclaimed. \"Coming from heaven\nknows where beyond the stars, swimming in here like a comet.\"\n\n\"They calculated its distance yesterday at some sixty-five million\nmiles from Earth,\" I said. \"It isn't so far beyond the orbit of Mars,\ncoming diagonally and heading very nearly for the Sun. But it's not a\ncomet.\"\n\nThe thing was indeed inexplicable; for many weeks now, astronomers had\nbeen studying it. This was early summer of the year 2070 A.D. All of\nus had recently returned from those extraordinary events I have\nalready recounted, when we came close to losing Johnny Grantline's\nradiactum treasure on the Moon, and our lives as well. My ship, the\n_Planetara_, in the astronomical seasons when the Earth, Mars, and\nVenus were within comfortable traveling distances of each other, had\ncarried mail and passengers from Greater New York to Ferrok-Shahn, of\nthe Martian Union, and to Grebhar, of the Venus Free State. Now it was\nwrecked on the Moon.[1]\n\n[Footnote 1: See \"Brigands of the Moon\", Ace Book, D-324]\n\nI had been under navigating officer of the _Planetara_. Upon her, I\nhad met Anita Prince, whose only living relative, her brother, was\namong those killed in the struggle with the brigands; Anita and I were\nsoon to marry, we hoped.\n\nI was waiting now in Greater New York upon the decision of the Line\nofficials regarding another spaceship. Perhaps I would have command of\nit, since Captain Carter of the _Planetara_ had been killed.\n\nIt was a month or so before that adventure, April, 2070, that this\nmysterious visitor from interstellar space first appeared upon our\nastronomical horizon. A little thing, at first, a mere unusual dot, a\npinpoint on a photo-electric star diagram which should not have been\nthere. It occasioned no comment at the time, save that some thought it\nmight be another planet beyond Pluto; but this was not taken seriously\nenough to get into the newscasts. None of us had heard about it as\nlate as May, when the _Planetara_ set out on what was to be her final\nvoyage.\n\nPresently, it was seen that the object could not be a planet of our\nsolar system; Coming in at tremendous speed, it daily changed its\naspect, gathering velocity until soon it was not a dot, but a streak\non every diagram-plate.\n\nIn a week or so the thing passed from an astronomical curiosity to an\nitem of public news. And now, early in June, when it had cut through\nthe orbit of Jupiter and was approaching that of Mars, fear was\ngrowing. The visitor was a menace. No astronomical body could come\namong us, with a mass as great as a fifth of the Moon, without causing\ntrouble.\n\nThe newscasters, with a ready skill for lurid possibilities, were\nblaring of all sorts of horrible events impending.\n\nI told the girls all I knew of the approaching wanderer. The density\nwas similar to that of Earth. The oncoming velocity and the calculated\nelements of its orbit now were such that within a few weeks more the\nnew planet would round our Sun and presumably head outward again. It\nwould pass within a few million miles of us, causing a disturbance to\nEarth's orbit, even a change of the inclination of our axis, affecting\nour tides and our climate.\n\n\"So I've heard,\" Venza interrupted me. \"They say that, and then they\nstop. Why can't a newscaster tell you what is so mysterious?\"\n\n\"For a very good reason, Venza: because you can't throw people into a\npanic. This whole thing, up to today, has been withheld from the\npublic of Earth and Venus. The Martian Union tried to withhold it, but\ncould not. Every heliogram between the worlds is censored.\"\n\n\"And still,\" said Venza sarcastically, \"you don't tell us what is so\nmysterious about this wanderer.\"\n\n\"For one thing,\" I said, \"it changes its direction. No normal heavenly\nbody does that. They calculated the elements of its orbit last April.\nThey've done it twenty times since, and every time the projected orbit\nis different. Just a little at first, but last week the accursed thing\nactually took a sudden turn, as though it were a spaceship.\"\n\nThe girls stared at me. \"What does that mean?\" Anita asked.\n\n\"They're beginning to make wild guesses but we won't go into that.\"\n\n\"What else is mysterious?\" Venza demanded.\n\n\"The thing isn't normally visible.\"\n\nVenza shifted her silk-sheathed legs. \"Don't talk in code!\"\n\n\"Not normally visible,\" I repeated. \"A world one-fifth as large as the\nMoon could be seen plainly by our 'scopes when well beyond Pluto. It's\nnow between Jupiter and Mars, invisible to the naked eye, of course,\nbut still it's not very far away. I've been out there myself. With\ninstruments, we ought to be able to see its surface; see whether it\nhas land and water, inhabitants perhaps. You should be able to\ndistinguish an object on its surface as large as a city, but you\ncan't.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" asked Anita. \"Are the clouds too thick? What causes it?\"\n\n\"They don't even know that,\" I retorted. \"There is something abnormal\nabout the light-waves coming from it. Not exactly blurred, but a\ndistortion, a fading. It's some abnormality of the light-waves.\"\n\nA swift rapping on our door-grid interrupted me, and Snap Dean burst\nin.\n\n\"Hola-lo, everybody! Is it a conference? You look so solemn.\"\n\nHe dashed across the room, kissed Venza, pretended that he was about\nto kiss Anita, and winked at me. He was a dynamic little fellow,\nsmall, wiry, red-headed and freckle-faced, and had been the\nradio-helio operator of the ill-fated _Planetara_. He was a perfect\nmatch for Venza, for all the millions of miles that separated their\nnative lands. Venza, too was small and slim, her manner as readily\njocular as his.\n\n\"And where have you been?\" Venza demanded.\n\n\"Me? My private life is my own, so far. We're not married yet, since\nyou insist on us going to Grebhar for the ceremony.\"\n\n\"Do stop it,\" protested Anita. \"We've been talking of....\"\n\n\"I know very well what you've been talking about. Everybody is. I've\ngot news for you, Gregg.\" He went abruptly solemn and lowered his\nvoice. \"Halsey wants to see us, right away.\"\n\nI regarded him blankly and my mind swept back. No more than a few\nshort weeks ago Detective-Colonel Halsey of Divisional Headquarters\nhere in Greater New York had sent for us, and we had been precipitated\ninto the Grantline affair. \"Halsey!\" I burst out.\n\n\"Easy, Gregg.\" Snap cast a vague look around Anita's draped apartment.\nAn open window was beside us, leading to a tiny catwalk balcony. It\nwas moonlit now, and two hundred feet above the pedestrian viaduct.\n\nBut Snap continued to frown. \"Easy, I tell you. Why shout about\nHalsey? The air can have ears.\"\n\nVenza moved and closed and sealed the window.\n\n\"What is it?\" I asked, more softly.\n\nBut Snap was not satisfied. \"Anita, do you have a complete isolation\nbarrage for this room?\"\n\n\"Of course I haven't, Snap.\"\n\n\"Well, Gregg do you have a detector with you?\"\n\nI had none. Snap produced his little coil and indicator dial. \"It's\nout of order, but let's see now. Shove over that chair, Gregg.\"\n\nHe disconnected one of the room's tube-lights and contacted with the\ncathode. It was a makeshift method, but as he dropped to the floor,\nuncoiling a little length of his wire for an external pick-up, we saw\nthat the thing worked. The pointer on the dial-face was swaying.\n\n\"Gregg!\" he muttered. \"Look at that. Didn't I tell you?\"\n\nThe pointer quivered in positive reaction. An eavesdropping ray was\nupon us.\n\nAnita gasped, \"I had no idea!\"\n\n\"No, but I did.\" Snap added softly. \"No one very close.\"\n\nHe and I carried the detector to the length of the hall. The indicator\nwent nearer normal. \"It must be the other way,\" I whispered.\n\nWe went to the moonlit balcony. \"Way down there on the pedestrian\narcade,\" I said.\n\n\"We'll soon fix that,\" Snap said.\n\nInside the room, we made connection with a newscaster's blaring voice.\nUnder cover of it we could talk. Snap gathered us close around him.\n\n\"Halsey has something important, and it's about this interstellar\ninvader. It all connects. His office paged me on a public mirror. I\nhappened to see it at Park-Circle 40. When I answered it, Halsey's man\nwanted me to talk in code. I can't talk in code; I have enough to\nworry about with the interplanetary helios. Then they sent me to an\nofficial booth, where I got examined for positive legal\nidentification, and then they put me on the official split-wave\nlength. After all of which precautions I was told to be at Halsey's\noffice tonight at midnight, and told a few other things.\"\n\n\"What?\" demanded Venza breathlessly.\n\n\"Only hints. Why take chances, by repeating them now?\"\n\n\"You said he wants me, too?\" I put in.\n\n\"Yes. You and Venza. We've got to get into his office secretly, by the\nvacuum cylinders. We're to meet a man from his office at the Eighth\nPostal switch-station.\"\n\n\"Venza?\" Anita said sharply. \"What in the universe can he want with\nVenza? If she's going, I'm going too!\"\n\nSnap gazed at her and grinned. \"That sounds like a logical deduction.\nNaturally he must want you; that's why he said Venza.\"\n\n\"I'm going,\" Anita insisted.\n\nWe left half an hour before midnight. The girls were both in gray,\nwith long capes. We took the public monorail into the mid-Manhattan\nsection under the city roof of the business district, and into the\nEighth Postal switch-station where the sleek bronze cylinders came\ntumbling out of the vacuum ports to be re-routed and dispatched again.\n\nA man was on the lookout for us. \"Daniel Dean and party?\"\n\n\"Yes. We were ordered here.\"\n\nThe detective gazed at the girls and at me. \"It was three, Dean.\"\n\n\"And now it's four,\" said Snap cheerfully. \"The extra one is Miss\nAnita Prince. Ever heard of her?\"\n\nHe had indeed. \"All right,\" he said. \"If you and Haljan say so.\"\n\nWe were put into one of the oversized mail cylinders and routed\nthrough the tubes like sacks of recorded letters; in ten minutes, with\na thump that knocked the breath out of all of us, we were in the\nswitch-rack of Halsey's outer office.\n\nWe clambered from the cylinder. Our guide led us down one of the\ngloomy metal corridors. It echoed with our tread.\n\nA door lifted.\n\n\"Daniel Dean and party.\"\n\nThe guard stood aside. \"Come in.\"\n\nThe door slid down behind us. We advanced into the small blue-lit\napartment, steel-lined like a vault.\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nColonel Halsey sat at his desk, with a few papers before him and a\nbank of instrument controls at his elbow. He pushed his audiphone and\nmirror-grid to one side.\n\n\"Sit down, please.\" He gave us each the benefit of a welcoming smile,\nand his gaze finished upon Anita.\n\n\"I came because you sent for Venza,\" Anita said quickly. \"Please,\nColonel Halsey, let me stay. I thought, whatever you want her for, you\nmight need me, too.\"\n\n\"Quite so, Miss Prince. Perhaps I shall.\" It seemed that in his mind\nwere many of the thoughts thronging my own, for he added: \"Haljan, I\nrecall I sent for you like this once before. I hope this may be a more\nauspicious occasion.\"\n\n\"So do I, sir.\"\n\nSnap said, \"We've been afraid hardly to do more than a whisper. But\nyou're insulated here, and we're mighty curious.\"\n\nHalsey nodded. \"I can talk freely to you, and yet I cannot.\" His gaze\nwent to Venza. \"It is you in whom I am most interested.\"\n\n\"Me? You flatter me, Colonel Halsey.\" She sat gracefully reclining in\nthe metal chair before his desk, seeming small as a child between its\nbig, broad arms. Her long gray skirt had parted to display her\nshapely, gray-satined legs. She had thrown off the hood of her cloak.\nHer thick black hair was coiled in a knot low at the back of her neck;\nher carmine lips bore an alluring smile. It was all instinctive. To\nthis girl from Venus it came as naturally as she breathed.\n\nHalsey's gray eyes twinkled. \"Do not look at me quite like that, Miss\nVenza, or I shall forget what I have to say. You would get the better\nof me; I'm glad you're not a criminal.\"\n\n\"So am I,\" she declared. \"What can I do for you, Colonel Halsey?\"\n\nHis smile faded at once. His glance included us all. \"Just this. There\nis a man here in Greater New York, a Martian whom they call _Set_\nMolo. He has a younger sister, _Setta_ Meka. Have any of you heard of\nthem?\"\n\nWe had not. Halsey went on, slowly now, apparently choosing his words\nwith the greatest care. \"There are things that I can tell you and\nthere are things that I cannot.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" asked Venza.\n\n\"My dear, for one thing, if you are going to help me you can do it\nbest by not knowing too much. For another, I have my orders; this\nthing concerns the very highest authorities, not only of the U.S.W.,\nbut in Ferrok-Shahn and Grebhar too.\"\n\nHe paused, but none of us spoke. Then Halsey said quietly, \"Well, this\nMartian and his sister are here now in Greater New York. They have\nsome secret. They are engaged in some activity, and I want to find\nout what it is. I have picked up only little parts of it.\"\n\nHe stopped; and out of the silence Snap said, \"If you don't mind,\nColonel Halsey, it seems to me you are mostly talking in code.\"\n\n\"I'm not, but I'm trying to tell you as little as possible. You, Miss\nVenza, need only understand this: the Martian, Molo, must be induced\nto give you some idea of what he is doing here.\"\n\n\"And I am to induce him?\" Venza asked calmly.\n\n\"That is my idea.\" The faint shadow of a smile swept Halsey's thin,\nintent face. \"My dear, you are a girl of Venus. More than that, you\nhave far more than your normal share of wits and brains.\"\n\nIt did not make Venza smile. She sat tense now, with her dark-eyed\ngaze fastened on Halsey's face. Anita, equally breathless, reached\nover and gripped her hand.\n\nThen Venza said slowly, \"I realize, Colonel Halsey, that this is\nsomething vital.\"\n\n\"As vital, my child, as it could be.\" He drew a long breath. \"I want\nyou to understand I am doing my duty. Doing, what seems the best\nthing, not for you, perhaps, but for the world.\"\n\nI seemed to see into his mind at that moment. He might have been a\nfather, sending a daughter into danger.\n\n\"I need not disguise the danger. I have lost a dozen men.\" He lighted\na cigarette. \"I don't seem to be able to frighten you?\"\n\n\"No,\" she said. And I heard Anita murmur, \"Oh, Venza!\"\n\n\"But you frighten me,\" said Snap. \"Colonel, look here; you know I'm\ngoing to marry this girl very soon.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know. You'll have to consider this a sacrifice, a voluntary\ndescent into danger, for a great cause in a great crisis. You four\nhave just come out of a very considerable danger. We know of what\nstuff you are made, all of you.\"\n\nHe smiled again. \"Perhaps that prominence is unfortunate for you, but\nlet me settle it now. Is there any one of you who will not take my\norders and trust my judgement of what is best? And do it, if need be,\nblindly? Will you offer yourselves to me?\"\n\nWe gazed at each other. Both the girls instantly murmured, \"Yes.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said at last. It was not too hard for me, for I thought I was\nyielding him Venza, not Anita.\n\nSnap was very pale. He stared from one to the other of us.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said finally. \"But Colonel, surely you can tell us more.\"\n\nHalsey tossed his cigarette away. \"I will tell you as much as I think\nbest. These Martians, Molo and his sister, do not know of Venza; at\nleast, I think that they do not. They apparently have not been here\nvery long. How they got here, we don't know. There was no passenger or\nfreight ship. In Ferrok-Shahn, they have a dubious reputation at best;\nbut I won't go into that.\n\n\"Venza, I will show you these Martians and the rest depends upon you.\nThere is a mystery; you will find out what it is.\"\n\nHe reached for his inter-office audiphone. \"I want to locate the\nMartian _Set_ Molo. Francis, Staff X2, has it in charge.\"\n\nThe audible connection came in a moment. \"Francis?\"\n\nWe could hear the answering microphonic voice, \"Yes Colonel.\"\n\n\"Is the fellow in a public place by any chance?\"\n\n\"In the Red Spark Cafe, Colonel. With his sister and a party.\"\n\n\"Good enough. The Red Spark has an image-finder. Have you visual\nconnection?\"\n\n\"Yes, the whole room; they have a dozen finders.\"\n\n\"Use a magnifier. Get me the closest view you can.\"\n\n\"It's done, Colonel. I did it just in case you called.\"\n\n\"Connect it.\"\n\nIn a moment our mirror-grid was glowing with the two-foot square image\nof the interior of the Red Spark Cafe. I knew the place by reputation:\na fashionable, more or less disreputable eating, drinking and dancing\nrestaurant, where money and alcholite flowed freely. The patrons were\nsuccessful criminals of the three worlds, intermingled with thrilled,\nrespectable tourists who hoped they would see something really evil.\n\nThe Red Spark was not far from Halsey's office; it was perched high in\na break of the city roof, almost directly over Park-Circle 29.\n\n\"There he is,\" said Halsey.\n\nWe crowded around his desk. The image showed the interior of a large\noval room, balconied and terraced; a dais dance-floor, raised high in\nthe center with three professional couples gyrating there; and beneath\nthem the public dance-grid, slowly rotating on its central axis. A\nhundred or so couples were dancing. The lower floor was crowded with\ndining tables; others were upon the little catwalk balconies, and\nstill others in the terraced nooks and side niches, half-enshrouded,\nhalf-revealed by colored draperies.\n\nThe image now was silent, for Halsey was not bothering with audio\nconnection. But it was a riot of color, flashing colored floodlights\nbathing the dancers in vivid tints; and there were twinkling spots of\ncolored tube-lights on all the tables. I saw, too, the blank\nrectangles of darkness against the walls which marked the private\ndining rooms, insulated against sight and sound. Here one might go for\nfrivolous indiscretion, or for conspiracy, perhaps, and be as secure\nfrom interruption as we were, here in Halsey's office.\n\nVenza asked eagerly, \"Which is he?\"\n\n\"Over there on the third terrace to the left. That table. There seem\nto be six of them in the party.\"\n\nWe heard Francis' voice; he was in Halsey's lower Manhattan office,\nwith this same image before him. \"We'll get a closer view.\"\n\nThe table in question was no more than a square inch on our image. We\ncould see an apparently gay party of men and women. One of the couples\nwas gigantic, a Martian man and woman, obviously. The others seemed to\nbe Earth or Venus people.\n\nFrancis' voice added: \"I've got an audio magnifier on them. Foley's\nbeen listening for an hour. Nice, clear English. Much good it does us;\nthis fellow is as cautious as a director of the lower air-lane. Here's\nyour near-look.\"\n\nOur image shifted to another view. The lens-eye with which we were\nconnected now gave us a view directly over the Martian's table. We\nwere looking down diagonally upon the table, at a distance of no more\nthan ten feet.\n\nThere were three Earthwomen in the party. There was nothing peculiar\nabout them. They were rather handsome, dissolute in appearance, all of\nthem obviously befuddled by alcholite. There was a man who could have\nbeen Anglo-Saxon. A wastrel, probably, with more money than wit; he\nwore a black dinner suit edged with white.\n\nOur attention focussed upon the other two. They were tall, as are all\nMartians. The young woman, _Setta_ Meka, seemed perhaps twenty or\ntwenty-five years of age, by Earth reckoning, in stature perhaps very\nnearly my own height, which is six feet two. It is difficult to tell a\nMartian's age, but she was very handsome, even by Earth standards; and\nin Ferrok-Shahn she would be considered a beauty. Her gray-black hair\nwas parted and tied at the back with a plaited metal rope. Her short\ndark cloak, so luminous a fabric that it caught and reflected the\nsheen of all the gaudy restaurant lights, was parted, its ends thrown\nback over her shoulders. Beneath it she wore the characteristic\nMartian leather jacket, and short, wide leather trousers ornamented\nwith spun metal fringes and tassels. Most Martian women have an\namazonian aspect, but I saw now that _Setta_ Meka was an exception.\n\nHer brother, who sat beside her, was a full seven feet or more. A\nhulking sort of fellow, far less spindly than most of his race, he\nmight have come from the polar outposts beyond the Martian Union. He\nwas bare-headed, his gray-black hair clipped close upon a round bullet\nhead, with the familiar Martian round eyes.\n\nI gazed into the face of Molo, as momentarily he turned his head. It\nwas a rough-hewn, strongly masculine face with a hawk-like nose, bushy\nblack brows frowning above deepset round eyes. The face of a keen\nscoundrel, I could not doubt, though the smooth-plucked gray skin was\nflushed now with alcholite, and the wide, thin-lipped mouth was\nleering at the woman across the table from him.\n\nLike his sister, he had thrown back his cloak, disclosing a brawny,\npowerful figure, leather clad, with a wide belt of dangling ornaments,\nsome of which probably were weapons.\n\nHow long we gazed at this silent colored image of the restaurant table\nI do not know. I was aware of Halsey's quiet voice: \"Look him over,\nMiss Venza. It depends on you.\"\n\nAnother interval passed. It seemed, as we watched, that Molo's\ninterest in his party was very slight. I got the impression, too, that\nthough at first he had seemed to be intoxicated, actually he was not.\nNor was his sister. Anxiety seemed upon her; the smile she had for\njests seemed forced; and at intervals she would cast a swift, furtive\nglance across the gay restaurant scene.\n\nMore drinks arrived. The Earthpeople at the table here seemed upon the\nverge of stupor; and suddenly it appeared that Molo had completely\nlost interest in them. With a gesture to his sister, he abruptly rose\nfrom his seat. She joined him. They left the table, and a red-clad\nfloor manager of the restaurant came at their call. Then in a moment\nthey were moving across the room.\n\nHalsey called sharply into his audiphone: \"Francis! Hold us to them if\nyou can.\"\n\nThey were standing now by the opened door of one of the Red Spark's\nprivate insulated rooms. We caught a glimpse of its interior, a gaily\nset table with a bank of colored lights over it.\n\nThe figure of a man was in there. He was on his feet, as though he had\njust arrived to meet the Martians here, and a hooded long cloak\nenveloped him. It may have been a magnetic \"invisible\" cloak, with the\ncurrent now off.\n\nWe caught only the fleetest of impressions before the insulated door\nclosed and barred our vision. The glimpse was an accident. Molo, taken\nby surprise at this appearance of his visitor, could hardly have\nguarded against it. The waiting figure was very tall, some ten feet,\nand very thin. The hood shrouded his face and head. In his hand he\nheld a large circular box of black shiny leather, of the sort in which\nwomen carry wide-brimmed hats. As Molo joined him he put the box\ngently on the floor. He handled it as though it were extraordinarily\nheavy; and as he took a step or two, he seemed weighted down. Just as\nthe room door was hastily closing, Meka sliding it from the inside, we\ncaught a fleeting glimpse of horror.\n\nThe lid of the hat box had lifted up. Inside was a great round thing\nof gray-white, a living thing; a distended ball of membrane, with a\nnetwork of veins and blood-vessels showing beneath the transparent\nskin.\n\nFor the instant we gazed, stricken. The ball was palpitating,\nbreathing! I saw convolutions of inner tissue under the transparent\nskin of membrane; a little tentacle, like an arm with a flat-webbed\nhand, was holding up the lid of the box. The lid rose a trifle\nhigher; the colored lights overhead gave us a brief but clear view of\nit.\n\nThe thing in the box was a huge living brain. I saw goggling,\nprotruding eyes; an orifice that could have been a nose, and a gash\nupended for a vertical mouth. It was a face. And the little tentacle\narm holding up the box-lid was joined to where the ear should have\nbeen.\n\nWas this something human? A huge distended human brain, with the body\nwithered to that tiny arm?\n\nThe palpitating thing sank down in the box and the lid dropped. And\nupon our horrified gaze the insulated door of the room slid too.\n\n\"By the gods!\" exclaimed Halsey. \"One of them dares come to the Red\nSpark. Here, almost in public.\"\n\nSo Halsey knew what this meant. His eyes were blazing now; his face\nwas white, with an intensity of emotion that transfigured it.\n\n\"Francis, tell Foley I'll be in the manager's office in five minutes.\"\n\nHe snapped off; our image connection with the Red Spark went dead.\n\n\"We're going to the Red Spark,\" he announced. \"This changes\neverything, yet I don't know. Venza, I may need you more than ever,\nnow.\"\n\nHalsey herded us to the office door. From his desk he had snatched up\na few portable instruments, and he flung on a cloak.\n\nIt was a brief trip to the Red Spark, on foot through the sub-cellar\narcade to where, under Park Circle 29, we went up in a vertical lift\nto the roof. We were in the side entrance oval of the restaurant in\nfive minutes.\n\nIn the dim metal room of Orentino, the Red Spark's manager, a barrage\nwas up and Foley was waiting for us. We could hear it faintly humming.\nNow we could talk.\n\nHalsey slammed the door down. He said swiftly, \"My men caught one of\nthese things this morning. They have it now and I think Molo does not\nyet know we captured it. A brain; we're convinced it understands\nEnglish and can talk, but no one has been able to make it talk yet.\nFoley, order that damned Orentino to de-insulate the room Molo is in.\nNow, by the gods, we may see and hear something.\"\n\nThe frightened manager of the Red Spark was in the control room.\nHalsey killed our barrage to let the outside connections get through\nto us. We all crowded around the mirror-grid which stood on Orentino's\ndesk. Foley gave us connection with the control room. We saw\nOrentino's face, his eyes nearly popping with fright. \"Colonel Halsey,\nI will do whatever you tell me.\"\n\n\"What room is that Martian occupying?\"\n\n\"Insulated 39.\"\n\n\"Break off the insulation. Do it slowly and he may not notice. Then\ngive us connection, audio and vision.\"\n\n\"But I have no image-finders in the insulated rooms.\"\n\n\"Cut off the barrage. I'll get connection there.\"\n\nFoley was already setting up his eavesdropper on the desk. The mirror\nblurred a little; then it clarified. We had the interior of the secret\nroom, and voices were coming out of Foley's tiny receiver.\n\nThe image showed the box on the floor, with its lid down. The tall\nhooded shape of the stranger stood with Molo and his sister by the\ntable. They were talking in swift, vehement undertones. The language\nwas Martian, a dialect principally used in Ferrok-Shahn. Our equipment\nbrought it in and I could understand it.\n\nMolo was saying: \"But you are the fool to have dared to come here!\"\n\n\"The master knows that there is danger. Something is wrong.\" The\nhooded stranger spoke like a foreigner, but not a Martian, nor an\nEarthman, and not like any person of Venus I had ever heard. It was a\nstrange, indescribable intonation, a flat, hollow voice.\n\n\"I say the master is concerned.\"\n\n\"Let him be.\"\n\n\"And he demanded I bring him here to find you. He is displeased that\nyou are here.\"\n\nWhat gruesome thing was this? Their glances seemed to go to the box on\nthe floor at their feet, as though the master were in there. But the\nlid of the box did not rise.\n\n\"Well, you have found me,\" Molo declared impatiently. \"When you know\nme better, always you will find I have my wits. The thing is for\ntomorrow night, not tonight.\"\n\n\"But that, my master is not sure.\" The hollow voice was deferential\nbut insistent. \"He fears danger; something has gone wrong. He is\nworking on it now, striving to receive the message! There is a\nmessage. He knows that much. Perhaps from our world, Wandl, itself.\"\n\nFor a moment Molo had no answer. His sister had not spoken. I noticed\nthat her gaze seemed roving the room.\n\n\"What is it I should do?\" Molo asked at last.\n\n\"Come with us to your home-room.\"\n\n\"But I have everything ready there. The contact is ready for tomorrow\nnight. Your world will control Earth.\"\n\n\"But if it be tonight?\"\n\nAgain Molo was silent. My breath stopped. On our mirror I saw the\nstranger's hood part just a little. There seemed to be no face; just\nthe blur of something brownish.\n\n\"But if it be tonight?\" the voice insisted.\n\n\"I will go,\" Molo said abruptly, \"but your coming here was dangerous.\nSuppose we cannot get out undetected? You know I will never go to\nwhere all our instruments are set up and have some damnable spy follow\nme. Is all going well on Venus and Mars?\"\n\n\"Yes. My master feels so. He seems to get messages. The contacts will\nbe made simultaneously.\" A gruesome chuckle. \"The capture of these\nthree worlds. We shall have all three enchained at once. Helpless.\"\n\nThe lid of the black box seemed again about to rise when there came a\nsharp cry from Meka. \"This room is not insulated!\"\n\nOur eavesdropping was discovered. Beside me, I heard Halsey give a low\ncurse. On our mirror we saw sudden action. The ten-foot, cloaked\nfigure laboriously lifted the black box, and swung with it toward the\nouter wall of the room. I saw now clearly with what a dragging, heavy\ntread that giant shape moved, as though it weighed, here on Earth, far\nmore than the normal weight to which it was accustomed.\n\n\"Over there!\" Molo gasped. \"The escape-port; this room has one. Meka,\ngo with him. I will join you. You know where.\"\n\nFoley cried, \"Colonel, I may be able to stop them!\"\n\nBut Halsey saw on our image that Molo was staying. \"Wait. Let them go.\nIf we have the Martian here, that's better.\"\n\nI saw the room's escape-port swing open as Meka and the hooded shape\ncarrying the box moved for it. The moonlit darkness of the outer\ncatwalk enveloped the disappearing figures.\n\nMolo was left alone. He closed the port swiftly. His detector now was\nin his hand, but Halsey anticipated him by a second or two. Our\nlistener went dead; our mirror darkened. Doubtless Molo was never sure\nwhether he had been spied on or not.\n\nHalsey was on his feet. \"Foley, get out into the main room. Stay with\nhim.\"\n\nBut there was no need to follow Molo. He had sent his visitor and\nsister out by the escape-port, which was usual enough; now he was back\nin the main room as though nothing of importance had happened, with an\nappearance of intoxication about him. He wavered jovially across the\nroom, threading his way through the gay diners, and reached the table\nwhere his party still sat carousing.\n\nAgain Halsey shut us off.\n\n\"He's got a base somewhere in the city; you heard what they said about\nit. We've got to trick him into going there, unsuspecting.\"\n\nHalsey seized the audiphone. \"Your chance, Venza. It's the only way.\nFoley, keep away from that Martian. Shut off all contacts. I'll meet\nyou out there in a moment. I'm sending a girl; she'll go after him.\"\n\n\"Now?\" Venza asked.\n\n\"Yes. It's the only way. Perhaps you can get him drinking. Venza, use\nall the wiles you possess now.\"\n\n\"No!\" gasped Snap. \"It's too dangerous!\"\n\nAnita was clinging to Venza. \"Colonel Halsey, I'm going too.\"\n\nHalsey stared, then made a swift decision. \"Right. That is still\nbetter.\"\n\nI jumped to my feet. \"Colonel, I should prefer that one of us men....\"\n\nHe gripped me by the shoulders. \"Gregg Haljan, I take no suggestions\nfrom you!\" His blazing eyes bored into me. \"There isn't a second to\nlose. Don't you realize this means destruction of our three inhabited\nplanets? I'll sacrifice myself, you, or these girls! Venza, take Anita\noutside. I'll join you immediately, give you last instructions. Take a\nportable audiphone with you.\"\n\nHe turned to Snap. \"This is the only way. These demons can't be\nforced. You know that.\"\n\nThe girls were moving toward the door. I met Snap's anguished gaze.\n\n\"Gregg, don't let them go!\"\n\n\"No! No, I won't!\"\n\nI made a lunge past Halsey, with Snap after me. Halsey did not move,\nbut one of his rays struck us. With all senses numbed, I felt myself\nfalling.\n\n\"Gregg--don't--let them....\"\n\nSnap had tumbled upon me. My senses did not quite fade. I was aware of\nAnita's and Venza's horrified cries, but Halsey pushed them toward the\ndoor. It slid up. I vaguely saw the two girls going out with Halsey\nafter them; and the door coming down.\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nI have no idea how long it was before Halsey came back. Snap and I\nwere seated on a low metal bench against the wall. The effect of the\nparalysing ray was wearing off. We were tingling all over, our senses\nstill confused.\n\nHalsey stalked in upon us. \"So you are recovered?\"\n\nSnap stammered, \"We--I say, we're sorry as hell we acted like that.\"\n\n\"I know you are.\" His voice softened. \"If I could have done anything\nelse, believe me, I would have. But I don't think harm will come to\nthem. They're clever.\"\n\n\"Are they outside?\" I asked. \"Did they find a way of meeting the\nMartians? How long have you been gone?\"\n\nHalsey merely stared at me as though he had no intention of answering.\nAnd then the audiphone on the desk buzzed.\n\n\"This is Halsey,\" he said. \"Yes, I have them here. Bring them--did you\nsay bring them?\"\n\nWe could not hear the answering voice, for Halsey had the muffler in\ncontact.\n\n\"No, I would prefer not to come. I'm watching something. I'm at the\nRed Spark Cafe. Well, I'm going back to my office presently to wait\nthere.\"\n\nHe continued in code. Like Snap, I had never had occasion to learn it.\nThe words were a strange sounding staccato gibberish. He ended, \"I\nwill send them, Grantline. Very well, I'll tell them to locate him. At\nonce, yes.\" He closed off the audiphone.\n\nHalsey swung on us. \"You're all right now?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" I stood up, drawing Snap up with me. \"What is wanted of us\nColonel?\"\n\n\"That's better, Gregg.\" He smiled, but he was still grim. \"I wanted\nyou here to wait for this call from the Conclave of Public Safety. It\nmet at midnight. They have ordered both of you there.\"\n\n\"That's a secret meeting, isn't it?\" asked Snap. \"There was no report\nof it over the air tonight.\"\n\n\"Yes. Secret.\" He was leading us to the door. \"They won't need you for\nmore than half an hour. When they finish, come back to my office. You\ncan come openly.\" He stood with his finger on the door lever.\n\"Good-by, lads. Foley will lead you to the service room. You are to\ntake a mail cylinder for Postal Switch-station 20. They'll re-route\nyou from there to the conclave auditorium.\"\n\nThe door slid up. \"When you disembark,\" he added, \"Ask for Johnny\nGrantline. You are to sit with him.\"\n\nHe showed us out and the door slid down before him. We trudged the\ncorridor, and Snap gripped me.\n\n\"For myself,\" he whispered swiftly, \"I'll go to the damnable conclave\nbecause I'm ordered. But I won't stay there long. Once we get out of\nit, if I don't route myself back to the Red Spark, I'm a motor-oiler.\"\n\nI agreed with him. We had a mental picture of Anita and Venza in the\nRed Spark's public room. Doubtless Orentino had created a way for them\nto meet Molo. They would sit there in the Red Spark with that drinking\nparty, and in less than an hour we would be back.\n\nBut as we crossed diagonally across an end of the main room with Foley\nleading us, we caught a glimpse of Molo's table. The party was still\nthere, but Molo, Anita, and Venza were gone!\n\nWe had no time to get any information. Foley abruptly left us and\nanother man took his place. In the service room a passenger cylinder\nwas waiting. Our guide entered it with us.\n\nAt the switch station we had the breath knocked out of us. After\nanother ten minutes in the vacuum tube, we reached our unknown\ndestination. The cylinder-slide opened. We found ourselves with a lone\nguard; and through a gloomy arcade opening, Johnny Grantline was\nadvancing, to greet us.\n\n\"Well, so here you are, Gregg. Hell to pay heaven, going on here. Come\non in; I'll tell you.\"\n\n\"We were sent for,\" Snap said.\n\n\"Yes, but they don't want you yet. Come in here.\"\n\nHe waved away the guard and led us through a padded arcade into a\nlow-vaulted audience room, windowless and gloomy. Across it, a doorway\npanel stood ajar. Grantline peered through it. There was the glow of\nlight from the adjoining room and the distant murmur of many voices.\n\nGrantline closed the door. \"Sit down and I'll tell you....\"\n\n\"Where are we?\" I asked.\n\n\"The ninth Conclave Hall.\"\n\nI knew its location: Lower Manhattan, high under the city roof.\n\nGrantline produced little cigarette cylinders. \"Steady your nerves,\nlads; you'll need it.\"\n\nHe grinned at us. The hand with which he lighted my cylinder was\nsteady as a tower-base, but he was excited. I could see it by the\nglint in his eyes, and hear it in his voice.\n\n\"What's going on?\" Snap demanded.\n\n\"It's about this invading planet. By the gods, when you hear what's\nreally been learned about it!\"\n\n\"Well, what?\" I asked.\n\nHe sketched what he had heard this night at the conclave. The\nmysterious invader was inhabited.\n\n\"How do they know that?\" Snap put in.\n\n\"Wait. I'll tell you the rest of it. The accursed thing changes its\norbit. It banks and turns like a spaceship! It stopped out in space;\nit's poised out there now between Mars and Jupiter. A world about a\nfifth the size of the Moon, and the beings on it can control its\nmovements. They've brought it in from interstellar space, into our\nsolar system. Evidently the point they've reached now is far as they\nwant to come. They've poised out there, getting ready to attack, not\nonly us, but Mars and Venus simultaneously.\"\n\nGrantline gazed at us through the smoke of his cigarette. He was much\nlike Snap, small, wiry, brisk of movement and manner, but older. His\nhair was graying at the temples; his voice carried the authority of\none accustomed to commanding men.\n\n\"Don't ask me for the technicalities of how they reached these\nconclusions. I'm no astronomer. I'm only telling you their conclusions\nand what their discussions have been here for the past hour.\"\n\nHeaven knows, we had no inclination to dispute him. What we had seen\nand heard at the Red Spark tallied with his words.\n\nHe went on swiftly, \"The attack, of whatever nature it may be, is\nimpending at once. Not next month, or next week, but now. Lord, Gregg,\nI don't blame you for staring like that. You don't know what's been\ngoing on for the past two days on Earth, and Venus and Mars. It's all\nbeen suppressed. Neither did I, until I heard it here tonight. The\nU.S.W., the Martian Union, the Venus Free State, are all preparing for\nwar. Every government spaceship on Earth is being commissioned. We're\nnot going to sit around and wait for invaders to land; the war won't\nbe fought on Earth if we can help it.\"\n\nWe stared. Snap asked, \"What makes them so sure?\"\n\n\"That war is coming? Plenty. This new planet has sent out spaceships.\nThe planet itself is hovering sixty million miles away from us, about\nforty million miles from Mars and close to ninety million from Venus.\nPerhaps its leaders think that's the most strategic spot.\n\n\"Then it sent out spaceships, three of them. One is hovering close to\nVenus. Another is near Mars, and the third is some 200,000 miles off\nEarth. Several of our interplanetary freighters are overdue; it seems\nnow that they must have encountered these invading ships and been\ndestroyed.\n\n\"Still more, and worse: these three hovering ships have already landed\nthe enemy on Mars and Venus. The helio-reports mention mysterious\nencounters in Ferrok-Shahn and Grebhar. For three or four days, Mars\nhas been in a panic of apprehension; Venus almost as bad. And some\nhave landed here. Not many, perhaps; but one has been captured. A\nthing--God, it's almost beyond description.\"\n\nWe could well agree with that, since Snap and I had just seen one.\n\n\"They've got it here,\" Grantline was saying. \"They've tried to make it\ntalk. They can't but they're going to try again.\"\n\nHe jumped to his feet and went to the door. \"They're bringing it in.\"\nUpon his face was a look of awed horror.\n\nWe stood crowding the small door-oval. It gave onto a darkened balcony\nof the conclave hall. The girders of the city roof were over us. There\nwere a few official spectators sitting up here in the dark on the\nbalcony, but none noticed us.\n\nThe lower floor of the hall was lighted. Around the polished oblong\ntables perhaps a hundred scientists and high governmental officials of\nthe three worlds were seated. Near the center of the hall was a small\ndais-platform. On a table there, someone had just placed a circular\nblack box, similar to the one we had seen previously.\n\nThe hall was hushed and tense. On the dais stood a group of Earth\nofficials. One of them spoke. \"Here it is, gentlemen. And this time,\nby God, we'll make it speak.\"\n\nGrantline whispered, \"That's the War Secretary from Greater London.\"\n\nI recognized him: Brayley, Commander in Chief of the land, air, water\nand space armies of the United States of the World. He was gigantic in\nstature, with a great shock of gray-white hair. A commanding figure,\nif there ever was one.\n\nBeside him, Nippor, the Japanese representative in Greater New York,\nseemed a pigmy. The acoustics of the silent hall carried his soft\nvoice up to us. \"I would be afraid of drugs. Will we use force? It is\nvital.\"\n\n\"Yes, by God! Anything.\"\n\nIt seemed that everyone in the hall must be shuddering: I could feel\nit like an aura pounding up at me. Brayley lifted the box-lid, reached\nin and raised the horrible thing. He held it up, a two-foot ball of\npalpitating gray-white membrane. Another living brain.\n\n\"Now, damn you, you're going to talk to us! Understand that? We're\ngoing to make you talk. Get that box out of the way.\"\n\nThey flung the box to the floor, and Brayley placed the brain on the\ntable.\n\nA glare of light, focussed on it, showed beneath the stretched taut\nmembrane the convolutions of the brain, like tangled purple worms. The\nblood-vessels seemed distended almost to bursting now. The gruesome\nface, with popping eyes and that gaping mouth, showed a horrible\ntravesty of terror. From where its ears should have been, a crooked\nlittle arm of flabby, gray-white flesh came down, one on each side and\nbraced the table. And I saw now that it had a shriveled body, or at\nleast little legs, bent, almost crushed under by its weight.\n\n\"Now, damn you,\" Brayley said, rubbing off his hands on a rough towel,\n\"for the last time: will you talk?\"\n\nThe goggling eyes held a terrified but baleful gaze upon Brayley's\nface. Did it understand? The eyes were fronted our way, and suddenly\ntheir glance swung up so that I seemed for an instant to see down into\nthem. And it struck me then: this was a thing of greater intelligence\nthan my own. A humanoid, with brain so developed that through myriad\ngenerations the body was shriveled, almost gone. A mind was housed\nhere, an intelligence housed in this monstrous brain.\n\nWere these the beings of the new planet which had come to attack us?\nBut how could this helpless creature, incapable of almost everything,\nobviously, save thought, do the work of its world?\n\nThen I recalled again that insulated room of the Red Spark Cafe: the\nthin, ten-foot hooded shape which was carrying the box. Was that,\nperhaps, an opposite type of being with the brain submerged, dwarfed,\nand the body paramount? Were there, on this mysterious planet, two\nco-existing types, each a specialist, one for the physical work and\nthe other for the mental?\n\nI stood with Snap and Grantline in that dark balcony doorway, gazing\ndown to where the giant brain stood braced upon its shriveled arms and\nlegs, and realized why we of Earth and Venus and Mars are all cast in\nthe same mould we call human. It is a little family of planets, here\nin our solar system; for countless eons we have been close neighbors.\nThe same sunlight, the same general conditions of life, the same\nseed, were strewn here by a wise Creator. A man from the Orient is\ndifferent from an Anglo-Saxon; a man of Mars differs a little more.\nBut basically they are the same.\n\nYet, confronting us now was a new type, from realms of interstellar\nspace, far beyond our solar system.\n\n\"For the last time, will you talk?\" snapped Brayley.\n\nThere was another interval of silence. The eyes of the brain were very\nwatchful. Its gaze roved the hall as though it were seeking for help.\nIt shifted its little arms on the table, seemingly exhausted from the\nphysical effort of supporting itself.\n\nBrayley's voice came again. \"Doubtless you can feel pain acutely. We\nshall see.\"\n\nWith what effort of will to overcome his revulsion we may only guess,\nhe reached forward and pinched the little arm. The result was\nelectrifying. From the upended slit of mouth in that goggling face,\ncame a scream. It pierced the heavy tense silence of the hall, ghastly\nin its timbre, like nothing any of us had ever heard before. And in it\nwas conveyed agony as though Brayley had not merely pinched that\nflabby arm, but had thrust a red-hot knife into its vitals.\n\nThe brain could feel pain indeed. It crouched with stiffened arms and\nlegs. The membrane of its great head seemed to bulge with greater\ndistension; the knotted blood-vessels were gorged with purple blood.\nThe eyes rolled. Then it closed its mouth. Its gaze steadied upon\nBrayley's face, so baleful a gaze that as I could see the reflection\nof its luminous purple glow a shudder of fear and revulsion swept me.\n\n\"So you did not like that?\" Brayley steadied his voice. \"If you don't\nwant more, you had better speak. How did you get here on Earth? What\nare you trying to do here?\"\n\nThere seemed an interminable silence; then Nippor took a menacing step\nforward. \"Speak! We will force it from you!\"\n\nAnd then it spoke. \"Do--not--touch--me--again.\"\n\nIndescribable voice! Human, animal or monster no one could say. But\nthe words were clear, precise; and for all their terror, they seemed\nto hold an infinite command.\n\nA wave of excitement swept the hall, but Brayley's gesture silenced\nit. He leaped forward and bent low over the palpitating brain.\n\n\"So you can talk. You came as an enemy. We have given you every\nchance today for friendship, and you have refused. What are you trying\nto do to us?\"\n\nIt only glared.\n\n\"Speak!\"\n\n\"I will not tell you anything.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, you will.\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\nAll the men on the platform were crowding close to it now.\n\n\"Speak!\" ordered Brayley again. \"Here in Greater New York is a hiding\nplace. Where is it?\"\n\nNo answer.\n\n\"Where is it? You are perhaps a leader of your world. I lead ours, and\nI'm going to master you now. Where is this hiding place?\"\n\nThe thing suddenly laughed, a gruesome, eerie cackle. \"You will know\nwhen it is too late. I think it is too late already.\"\n\n\"Too late for what?\"\n\n\"To save your world. Doomed, your three worlds! Don't touch--me!\"\n\nIt ended with a scream of apprehension as Nippor grasped the crooked\nlittle arm. \"Tell us!\"\n\n\"No!\" It screamed again. \"Let--me--go!\"\n\n\"Tell us!\" Nippor strengthened his squeezing grip. The thing was\nwrithing, the thin ball of membrane palpitating, heaving. And suddenly\nit burst. Over all its purpled surface, blood came with a gush.\n\nNippor and Brayley staggered backward. The scream of the brain ended\nin a choking gurgle. The little legs and tiny body wilted under it;\nthe round ball of membrane sank to the table. It rolled sidewise upon\none arm and ear, and in a moment its palpitation ceased. A purple-red\nmass of blood, it lay deflated and flabby.\n\nIt was dead.\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\"But see here,\" I said, \"did they mention the Martian, Molo, at all?\"\n\n\"They were discussing Molo before you arrived,\" Grantline told us.\n\nWe had drawn back from the doorway. The conference, with the dead\nthing removed, was proceeding. Snap and I had momentarily forgotten\nAnita and Venza; but now we were in a panic to get back to the Red\nSpark.\n\n\"But you can't go,\" said Grantline. \"Brayley ordered you here. He'll\nwant to see you in a moment.\"\n\n\"Well, why doesn't he see us now?\" Snap protested. \"I'm not going to\ncool myself off sitting here.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, you are.\"\n\nGrantline sent word to Brayley that we were here. In a moment the\nanswer came. We were to wait a short time; he would want to see us.\n\nWe swiftly told Grantline what had happened at the Red Spark, and\nfound that already he knew. Francis had relayed it to the conference,\nand Halsey was in constant communication with the officials here.\n\n\"Then what is happening?\" I demanded. \"Where are the girls? Has Halsey\nheard from them?\"\n\nAgain Grantline went to a nearby room.\n\n\"Anita sent a message,\" he said, when he returned. \"They are with\nMolo. Halsey is ordering a squad of men to be ready.\"\n\nGrantline told us what had been happening in the Red Spark. Anita and\nVenza, simulating drunkenness with a skill for acting which I knew\nboth of them possessed, had joined Molo's party. Perhaps if Meka had\nbeen there she would have seen through them.\n\nBut Molo did not. And they have since told me that the Martian himself\nwas far from sober, although he was probably not aware of it. He\nyielded to their demands to leave the restaurant with him. He wanted,\nas we know, to leave unobtrusively; and Venza threatened a scene\nunless she could go.\n\nHe took them, leaving openly in a public fare-car. Doubtless he at\nfirst intended to de-rail them somewhere, but they convinced him that\nhe was not being followed. Twice he used his detector, and Anita and\nHalsey were clever enough to throw off their rays in time to avoid it.\nThen Halsey lost connection with the fleeing car, and after that Molo\nchanged his mind about ditching the girls.\n\n\"But where are they now?\" I demanded.\n\n\"You,\" said Grantline sternly, \"are out of it. Do you think that\nHalsey, under Brayley's orders, will neglect any chance to find out\nwhere Molo is hiding? Something is about to happen. This conference is\nwrestling with it. In Grebhar and Ferrok-Shahn they're striving to\nfind out what it is. Something impending _now_. Helios are pouring in\nhere from Venus and Mars. They're mobilizing their spaceships, just as\nwe are.\"\n\nGrantline at last was letting out all his apprehensions on us, with\nthis burst. \"Halsey didn't tell you that the entire resources of his\norganization are out upon this thing tonight. Here at this conclave\nthere's a room of information-sorters. That's just where I came from a\nmoment ago. Every country on our Earth is making ready--for what,\nnobody knows!\n\n\"He's had two fragmentary calls from Anita. He has a hundred men ready\nto rush to their aid, and to capture Molo's lair. He expects another\nmessage from Anita any moment. This conference here knows every\nmovement that is being made, within ten or twenty seconds of its\nmaking. Perhaps upon Anita and Venza the whole outcome of this thing\nmay hang.\"\n\nWe had no answer to that. \"Do you know who Molo is? He's an\ninterplanetary pirate; his ship is the _Star-Streak_.\"\n\n\"Good Lord!\"\n\nWe had heard of him. For five years past, a gray spaceship, with a\nbase supposedly hidden in the Polar deserts of Mars, had been\nterrorizing interplanetary shipping.\n\n\"They think,\" Grantline went on, \"that Molo was cruising with his\npirate ship. He has, as you know, a band of criminals drawn from all\nthe three worlds. There are about fifty of them, commanded by his\nsister and himself. We think that Molo encountered the three ships\nwhich that new planet sent out. The _Star-Streak_ was captured,\nperhaps destroyed. Molo and his band, joined with this new enemy, to\nsave themselves, and because they have been promised rewards.\"\n\n\"But why should these brains want their help?\" Snap demanded.\n\n\"Wouldn't you say it was because, in Ferrok-Shahn, Grebhar and here in\nGreater New York, simultaneously tonight, something has to be\naccomplished, something the brains themselves could not do? Molo and\nhis band know all three cities. How they landed here in Greater New\nYork nobody knows; the enemy spaceship is 200,000 miles out. Obviously\nthey came from it, landed secretly with some smaller ship somewhere on\nEarth and made their way here.\"\n\nA buzzer sounded beside us. A voice commanded: \"Grantline, bring Gregg\nHaljan and Daniel Dean to room six at once.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn room six we stood before the War Secretary, who had arrived there a\nmoment ahead of us.\n\n\"Ah, Haljan and Dean. I'm glad to see you.\"\n\nHe was still white and shaken. Beads of perspiration stood upon his\nforehead. He mopped them off.\n\n\"I've just had a rather terrible experience.\" He did not suggest that\nwe sit down. He went on crisply: \"Grantline no doubt has told you of\nwhat's going on. Disturbing, terrifying. Haljan, we have a ship being\nrushed into commission tonight. You know her, the _Cometara_.\"\n\n\"I know her,\" I said.\n\n\"Quite so. She is taking off as soon as we can ready her. She will\ncarry about fifty men. Grantline is in charge of the armament and men.\nYou, Dean, we want to handle her radio-helio.\"\n\n\"Right,\" said Snap.\n\n\"And you, Haljan, we can think of no one better to navigate her.\"\n\nHe waved away my appreciation. \"Within a brief time we shall have\nthirty such ships in space. Mars and Venus also are mobilizing.\"\n\nHe stood up. \"We feel, Haljan, that if anyone can handle the\n_Cometara_ with skill enough to combat this lurking enemy, it will be\nyou.\"\n\n\"I'll do my best, sir.\"\n\n\"We know that. The ship is leaving from the Tappan Interplanetary\nStage shortly after dawn. When have you and Dean last slept?\"\n\n\"Last night,\" we both said.\n\n\"Quite so. Then you need sleep now. I want you to go at once to the\nTappan Fieldhouse. The commander there will make you comfortable. Eat,\nand sleep if you can. We want you in good shape. You're to keep out of\nthis night's activities here in the city; you understand?\"\n\n\"Yes sir.\"\n\nAn orderly was approaching behind Brayley. \"I'll be back in a moment,\nRollins.\"\n\nHe shook hands with us. \"I may not see you again before it's over.\nGood luck, lads. Grantline, they need you for a moment in the hall;\nsomething about electronic space weapons, further equipment for the\n_Cometara_. Then you'd better go to Tappan House too, and get some\nsleep.\"\n\nWe were dismissed. Snap and I regarded each other hesitantly. I said\nimpulsively, \"Mr. Brayley, Detective-Colonel Halsey is using two\ngirls.\"\n\n\"Yes, we're watching that, Haljan.\"\n\n\"They're the girls we're to marry,\" I added. \"May we communicate with\nColonel Halsey?\"\n\n\"Yes. Call him from here.\" He smiled wanly. \"But keep out of it; we\nneed you at dawn.\"\n\nThe Tappan departure-stage was only a few miles up the Hudson; we\ncould get there in half an hour. It was now nearly trinight, halfway\nbetween midnight and dawn. I had my portable audiphone and got Halsey\nat once.\n\n\"You Gregg?\"\n\n\"Yes. They're through with us at the Conclave. Where is Anita?\"\n\n\"We heard from her twice. I'm expecting....\"\n\nWe could hear someone interrupting him. Then he came back. \"Gregg?\nMolo took them somewhere. I didn't dare fling after them. He had his\ndetector going, and Anita warned me not to try it. She had to stop\nconnection herself. God knows how she was able to whisper to me at\nall.\"\n\nHis voice, like Brayley's, had the ring of a man strained to the\nbreaking point. I could appreciate how Halsey must feel, forced to\nremain at his desk with its encircling banks of instruments; holding\nall the network of his farflung activities centralized; his\ndecisions, his commands in a hundred places almost simultaneously,\nwhile his body sat there inactive.\n\n\"Gregg, the girls must have arrived at Molo's place by now. If only\nthey know where they are! I have lookouts throughout the city with\nintricate and complete connecting equipment. Gregg, I must\ndisconnect.\"\n\n\"Colonel, give me Anita's frequency. Maybe Snap or I can pick up the\nmessage.\"\n\nHe named the oscillating frequency, then disconnected.\n\n\"Try that frequency,\" Snap suggested. \"We've got to do something.\"\n\nThe door-slide opened suddenly and an orderly appeared. \"Haljan?\"\n\n\"Get the hell away,\" roared Snap. \"We've had our orders; we don't want\nany from you.\"\n\n\"Gregg Haljan and Daniel Dean are paged on the mirrors.\"\n\nSomeone in the city wanted us; our names were appearing on the various\nmirror-grids publicly displayed throughout the city in the hope that\nwe would answer.\n\n\"That's different,\" said Snap. \"Answer it for us, that's a good\nfellow. We're busy.\"\n\n\"It must be important,\" the orderly insisted. \"The caller registered a\nfee at the Search Bureau; that's how they located you here. He paid\nthe highest fee to search you. An emergency call.\"\n\nIt was against the law to invoke the services of the Search Bureau\nunless based upon actual impending danger. \"We'll take it,\" I said.\n\n\"Come with me.\" He turned to the left and down the corridor.\n\nWe hastened with him to a corridor cubby. Upon the audiphone there I\nwas at once connected with a voice, and an anxious man's face with a\ntwo-day growth upon it.\n\n\"Haljan! Thank God you answered. This is Dud Ardley. Me and Shac are\nhere. Listen, this is the lower cellar corridor, Lateral 3, under\nBroadway. Me and Shac just have seen your girls down here.\"\n\nNews of Anita and Venza! I could see in the mirror-image, behind Dud's\nhead the outlines of the little public cubby from which he was\ncalling. He and his brother, on some illicit errand of their own in\nEast Side lower Manhattan, had seen figures alighting from a\nfare-car. They had caught a glimpse of the faces of Anita and Venza.\nThe girls were hooded and cloaked; a hooded man was with them. The\nfare-car quickly rolled away, and the hooded figures, suddenly\nbecoming invisible within their magnetic cloaks, had vanished.\n\n\"S'elp me, we couldn't do nothin'. You know we take no chances with\nthe police by carryin' cylinders. So I paged you in a hurry.\"\n\n\"Dud, that's damn nice of you. Where are you now? Tell me again.\"\n\nThe Ardleys, knowing nothing of the events of this night, supposed\nthat the girls were being abducted, and decided I should be informed.\n\n\"Damn right, Dud. We'll come at once. You two wait for us?\"\n\n\"Sure. If you got instruments, maybe we can track 'em. It wasn't a\nquarter of a mile from here, over toward the river. Plenty of rotten\ndumps down there.\"\n\n\"Wait for us, Dud. We'll come in a rush.\"\n\nI slammed shut the audiphone. Snap, beside me, had heard it all. He\nshoved the astonished orderly out of the way.\n\n\"What's the nearest exit-route out of here?\"\n\n\"To the city roof, sir. Up this incline.\"\n\nWe dashed up the spiral incline, through a low exit-port, and were in\nthe starlight of the city roof.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Connect it, Gregg! You can't tell; her message might come over any\nminute.\"\n\nI tuned my coils to the seldom used oscillation frequency which Halsey\nhad told us Anita's transmitter was sending.\n\n\"Anything, Gregg?\"\n\n\"No. Dead channel.\"\n\nThe air, in Anita's channel, was bafflingly silent.\n\nWe had been challenged by a roof-guard when we appeared from the upper\nport of the Conclave Hall; the city roof was not open to public\ntraffic. But with our identifications, he found us a single-seat\nhand-tram, and started us southward on the deserted route.\n\nIt was a cloudless night, with stars like thickly-strewn diamonds on\npurple velvet. The city roof lay glistening in the starlight. In my\ngreat-grandfather's time there had been no roof here; the open city\nwas exposed to all the inclement weather. But gradually the arcades\nand overhead viaducts, cross balconies and catwalks which spanned the\ncanyon street between the giant buildings became a roof. It spread,\nnow terraced and sloped to top the lofty buildings, like a great\nrumpled sheet propped by the knees of sleeping giants. Some of the\nroof was of opaque alumite, dark patches, alternating with the great\nglassite panes which in places admitted the daylight.\n\nOur little tram sped along southward, wending its way over the\nterraces. Save for the guards and lookouts in their occasional\ncubbies, and the air-traffic directors in their towers, we were alone\nup here. The roof was tangled with air-pipes, line-wire conduits,\naerials, arterial systems of the ventilating and lighting devices. As\nfar as one could see the ventilators stood fronting the night breeze\nlike listening ears. There were water tanks, great cross-bulkheads and\nflumes to handle the rain and snow. A few traffic towers maintained\norder in the overhead air-lanes. Their beacons shot up into the sky\nwhen the passing lights marked the thinly-strewn trinight traffic.\n\nWe were stopped at intervals, but in each case were passed promptly.\n\n\"Nothing yet, Gregg?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nAnita's channel remained empty. It was, I suppose, no more than ten\nminutes during which we sped south along the grotesque maze of the\nroof; but to us it was an eternity. If only some message would come!\n\n\"I'll pull up here.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nI gathered up my little audiphone, thrust it under my dark flowing\ncloak. If only our cloaks were magnetic!\n\nWe leaped from our car. \"In a rush, Haljan?\" asked a guard.\n\n\"That's us. Orders from Mr. Brayley.\"\n\nWe left him and plunged into a descending automatic lift. A drop of a\nthousand feet; we shot downward past all the deserted levels, past the\nground-level, the undersurface transportation lanes, the sub-river\ntubes, the sub-cellar, down to the very bottom of the city.\n\n\"Come on, Gregg. Two segments from here.\"\n\nWe advanced at a run. At this hour of night, hardly a pedestrian was\nin evidence. It was an arched vaulted corridor, almost a tunnel, dimly\nblue-lit with short lengths of fluorescent tubes at intervals on the\nceiling. For all the vaunted mechanisms of our time, the air here was\nheavy and fetid. Moisture dripped from the concrete roof. It lay on\nthe metal pavement of the ground; the smell of it was dank, tomb-like.\n\nThere were frequent cross-tunnels. We turned eastward into one of\nthem. For a segment there were the lower entrances to the cellars of\nthe giant buildings overhead. We passed a place where the\ntunnel-corridor widened into a great underground plaza. The sewerage\nand wire-pipes lay like tangled pythons on its floor. Half across it,\nby the glow of temporary lights strung on a cable, a group of\nrepairmen were working. We passed them, headed in to where the tunnel\nnarrowed again and there were now occasional cubby entrances to\nunderground dwellings.\n\nIt was a rabbit warren from here to the river, haunted by criminals\nand by miserable families, many of whom never saw the daylight for\nweeks at a time. The giant voices of the city hardly carried down\nhere, so that an oppressive silence hung upon everything.\n\n\"That next crossing, Gregg. They said they'd wait for us there.\"\n\nOccasional escalators led upward. In advance of us was a narrow\nintersection. There were a few lights in the bullseyes of the\nsubterranean dwelling rooms, but most of them were dark.\n\n\"Easy, Snap. Not so fast.\"\n\nI pulled Snap to a walk. We edged over against the tunnel side. We had\npassed a small lighted audiphone cubby, evidently the one from which\nDud and Shac had paged us. They should have been here waiting; but\nthere was nothing but the empty, gloomy tunnels.\n\n\"Something is coming!\" Snap clutched at me; we drew our cloaks around\nus and waited in a shadowed recess. Down a side incline, a segment\nbehind us, a small automatic food truck came lurching. It pulled up at\nan arcade entrance. Its driver slid the portals, deposited his cases\nof food, locked the panel after him; and in a moment he and his truck\nwere gone up the incline.\n\nWe heard, in the ensuing silence, a low groan near at hand; then\nabruptly it stopped. We saw, within twenty feet of us, two dark\nfigures lying on the pavement grid in a black patch of shadow where\nthe mailtube came down in a curve and disappeared into the tunnel\nwall.\n\nWe bent over the figures of two men. They lay together, one half upon\nthe other, black-garbed figures with white, staring faces. One\ntwitched a little and then lay still.\n\nThey were Shac and Dud Ardley.\n\n\"Murdered, Gregg! Good Lord!\"\n\nBoth were dead, but we could see no marks on either of them.\n\nI found my wits. \"Snap, we can't stand like this wholly visible.\"\n\nI pulled Snap away. We darted a few feet. The light of the tunnel\nintersection was directly over us. \"Not here, Snap! Run!\"\n\nUnder the curving vacuum tube a little further along, we found\nshelter. Snap murmured: \"The girls went past here. But which way,\nGregg?\"\n\nAs though I knew!\n\nI felt at that moment, under the shirt against my skin, the anode of\nmy audiphone tingling. A receiving signal! In the gloom, I could see\nSnap's white face as he watched me bring it out.\n\nWe heard a tiny microphonic voice, Anita's voice.\n\n\"Colonel Halsey. Yes I have the location. Lafayette 4--East corridor,\nlowest level. A descending entrance. Don't you speak again; I've only\na minute! Venza safe--but send help. Something we don't understand--a\nstrange mechanism here.\"\n\nThen Halsey's interrupting voice. \"Anita, escape! You and Venza!\"\n\n\"We can't. They've got us!\"\n\n\"I'm sending men. They'll be there in ten minutes.\"\n\n\"Ten minutes will be too late. Molo is....\"\n\nIt seemed that we heard her scream; then the waves blurred and died.\n\nLafayette 4--East corridor, lowest level. \"Snap, that's here! A\ndescending entrance.\"\n\nWe stood back against the great curving side of the postal vacuum\ntube. Within it I heard the hiss and clank as a mail cylinder flashed\npast. Halsey's secret orders must be going out now. His men nearest\nthis place would come in a rush. But Anita said that would be too\nlate.\n\nSnap and I were frantically searching. Somewhere here was an entrance\nto Molo's lair. It seemed in the silence that Anita's scream was still\nringing in my ears. Had it been entirely from the instrument, or were\nwe so close that we had heard its distant echoes?\n\n\"Gregg, help me.\" Snap was tugging at a horizontal door-slide, like a\ntrap in the tunnel floor, partly under the vacuum tube. \"Stuck!\" he\ngasped.\n\nIt yielded with our efforts. It slid aside. Steps led downward into\nblackness. We plunged in, caution gone from us. The steps went down\nsome twenty feet; we were in another smaller corridor. It was vaguely\nlighted by a glow from somewhere, and as my pupils expanded, I could\nsee this was a shabby alley, opening ahead into a winding passage with\nthe slide-port above us like its back gate. A warren of cubbies was\nhere, a little sequestered segment of disreputable dwellings.\n\nWe stood peering, listening. \"Shall I try the eavesdropper, Gregg?\"\n\n\"Yes. No, wait!\" I thought I heard distant sounds.\n\n\"Voices, Snap. Listen.\"\n\nMore than voices. A thud: footsteps running. A commotion, back in this\nwarren, within a hundred feet of us.\n\n\"This way,\" I murmured.\n\nWe plunged into a black gash. There was a glow of light, a glassite\npane in a house wall nearby. The commotion was louder, and under it\nnow we heard a vague humming: something electrical. It was an\nindescribably weird sound, like nothing I had ever heard before.\n\nSnap clutched at me. \"In here, but where is the accursed door?\"\n\nThere was a glassite pane, but we could find no door. In our hands we\nheld small electronic bolt-cylinders, short-range weapons.\n\nThe hum and hissing was louder. It seemed to throb within us, as\nthough vibration were communicating to every fiber of our bodies.\n\nLight was streaming through the glassite pane, and we glimpsed the\ninterior of the room. The light now came from a strange mechanism set\nin the center of the metal cubby. I caught only an instant's glimpse\nof it, a round thing of coils and wires. The metal floor of the room\nwas cut away, exposing the gray rock of Manhattan Island. And against\nthe rock, in a ten-foot circle, a series of discs were contacted, with\nwires leading from them to the central coils.\n\nThe whole was glowing with opalescent light. It was dazzling,\nblinding. Within in it the goggled figure of Molo was moving,\nadjusting the contacts. He stooped. He straightened, drew back from\nthe light.\n\nOnly an instant's glimpse, but we saw the girls, crouching with black\nbandages on their eyes. Meka, goggled like her brother, was holding\nthem. A tall shape carrying a round black box darted through the light\nand ran. Molo leaped for the girls; the hum had mounted to a wild\nelectrical scream. Molo flung his sister back out of the light.\n\nThey all vanished. There was nothing but the light, and the mounting\ndynamic scream.\n\nBeside me, Snap was pounding on the glassite panel. I joined him.\nEverything was dreamlike, blurring as though unconsciousness was upon\nme.\n\nWhere was Snap? Gone? Then I saw him nearby. He had found a door, but\nit wouldn't yield. I saw his arm go up in a gesture to me.\n\nHe ran; I found myself running after him, but I stumbled and fell.\nThen over me the scream burst into a great roar of sound. It seemed so\nintense, so gigantic a sound that it must ring around the world.\n\nAnd the light burst with an exploding puff. The black metal cubby\nwalls seemed to melt like phantoms in a dream. A titan's blowtorch,\nthe opalescent light shot upward, a circular ten-foot beam, eating its\nway through all the city levels as though they were paper, up through\nthe city roof.\n\nMolo's cubby was gone. His mechanism was eaten by the light and\ndestroyed. There was only this motionless, upstanding beam, contacted\nhere with the Earth, streaming like an opalescent sword into the\nstarry sky.\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nI must paint now upon a broader canvas to depict the utter chaos of\nthis most memorable night in the history of the Earth, Venus and Mars.\n\nFrom that point in the bowels of Greater New York, near the southern\ntip of Manhattan Island, the mysterious light-beam shot up. It\nscreamed with its weird electrical voice for an hour, so penetrating a\nsound that it was heard with the unaided ears as far away as\nPhiladelphia. A titan voice it was, shrill as if with triumph. There\nwere millions of people awakened by it this night; awakened and struck\nwith a chill of fear at this nameless siren shrilling its note of\ndanger. The sound gradually subsided; it seemed to reach its peak\nwithin a few minutes of the appearance of the light, and within an\nhour it had ceased.\n\nBut the light beam remained. Those who inspected it closely have given\na clear description of its aspect; but to this day its real nature has\nnever been determined.\n\nIt was a circular beam of about a ten-foot diameter. In color it was\nvaguely opalescent, rather more brilliant at night than in the day.\nWith the coming of the sun it did not fade, but remained clearly\nvisible, with a spectrum sheen when the sunlight hit it so that it had\nsomewhat the appearance of a titanic, straightened rainbow.\n\nFrom that contact point with our Earth, the inexplicable beam stood\nvertically upward. It ate a vertical hole like a chimney up through\nall the city levels, through the roof and into the sky. It had a\ntremendous heat, communicable by contact so that it melted the city\nabove it with a clean round hole. But the heat was non-radiant.\n\nI was found lying within fifty feet of the base of the beam. There had\nbeen an explosion, so that Molo's metal room was gone; but from where\nI lay there was only a warmth to be felt from the light.\n\nHalsey's men found me within half an hour. I was unconscious but not\ninjured. I think now that the sound and not the light overcame me. I\npresently recovered consciousness; for another hour I was blind and\ndeaf, but that quickly wore off. They rushed me through the chaos of\nthe city to the Tappan Headquarters. Grantline was there, but not\nSnap. I sent them back when once I was fully conscious. They searched\nall the vicinity at the base of the light. Snap, alive or dead, was\nnot to be found.\n\nAnita and Venza were gone. I had seen Molo and Meka plunge away with\nthem as the light-beam burst forth. They were gone, and Snap was gone.\n\nThere was, by now, a turmoil unprecedented throughout all the\nmetropolitan area. The motionless light-beam itself had done little\ndamage, but its appearance brought instant chaos. Within a radius of\nfive miles of its base, the city was plunged into darkness. All power\nwas cut off. Every vehicle, even the aeros passing overhead, and, the\nventilating system stopped. Audiphones were wrecked; it subsided\nwithin an hour, though, and after that, lights and instruments brought\ninto the area were not affected.\n\nBut during that hour, south Manhattan was in panic. A multitude of\nterrified people awakened in the night to find blackness and that\nscreaming sound. The streets and corridors and traffic levels were\njammed with throngs trampling and killing one another in their efforts\nto escape.\n\nThis was in the stricken area; but everywhere else the panic was\nspreading. Transportation systems were almost all out of commission.\nThe panic spread until by dawn there was a wild exodus of refugees\njamming the bridges and viaducts and tunnels, streaming from all the\ncity exits.\n\nThis was Greater New York. But from Venus and Mars came similar\nreports. In Grebhar and in Ferrok-Shahn, doubtless almost simultaneous\nwith Greater New York, similar light-beams appeared.\n\n\"But what can it be?\" I demanded of Grantline. \"Something Molo\ncontacted there? He did it. That was what he was working for, and he\naccomplished his purpose. But what will the beam do to us?\"\n\n\"It's doing plenty,\" said Grantline grimly.\n\n\"He didn't intend that. There was something else.\"\n\nBut what? As yet, no one knew. I had already told the authorities what\nI had seen. I was the only eye-witness to Molo's activities; and\nheaven knows I had but a brief, confused glimpse.\n\nThe beam remained; it streamed upward from the rock. They thought,\nthis night, that Molo's strange current had set up a disintegration of\nthe atoms, and that electronic particles from them were streaming into\nspace.\n\nThe light-beam seemed impervious to attack. Within a few hours the\nauthorities were attacking its base with various vibratory weapons but\nwithout success.\n\nFrom where Grantline and I sat, we saw the dawn coming. But the\nradiance-beam remained unaffected. \"Gregg, look there at Venus!\"\n\nTo the east of us there was a distant line of metal structures\nsurmounting the mid-Westchester hills; above them, in the brightening\nsky of dawn, Venus was just rising. Mars had already set at our\nlongitude. Venus, fairly close to the Earth now, was the \"Morning\nStar.\"; it mounted now above that line of metal stages in the\ndistance.\n\nAnd as Grantline gestured, I saw from Venus the same sword-like beam\nstreaming off almost to cross our own.\n\nGrantline and I, with a mutual thought, ran around the balcony and\ngazed to where Mars had set. A narrow radiance was streaming up among\nthe stars off there.\n\nThree swinging swords of light in the sky! With the rotation of the\nplanets, they swept the firmament. The mysterious enemy had planted\nthem--but why? What was coming next?\n\nAnd as though to answer us, from far to the south, over mid-Jersey,\ncame a new manifestation. We saw a speck rising, a distant mounting\nspeck of something dark, with streamers of tiny radiance flowing from\nit.\n\n\"A spaceship, Gregg.\"\n\nIt seemed so. It came slowly from above the maze of distant\nstructures, gathered speed, and in a moment was gone.\n\nBut others, better equipped, had observed it. It was a cylindrical\nprojectile, with stream-fluorescence propelling it upward, an unusual\nform of spaceship. Telescopically it was seen until well after dawn.\nSpeeding out in the direction of the Moon.\n\nMolo and his weird allies had escaped, I thought. With their work\ndone here on Earth, they were off to rejoin the hovering enemy ship\n200,000 miles out.\n\nI stood gripping Grantline on that balcony, and gazed with sinking\nheart. Were Anita and Venza prisoners on that mounting ship? And Snap:\nI prayed he was there with the girls to lend them the protection I had\nfailed to give.\n\n\"Haljan and Grantline wanted below.\"\n\nThe voice of a mechanic on the balcony behind us roused us from our\nthoughts. We went down through the busy building.\n\nThe workshops of Tappan Interplanetary Headquarters had for hours been\nringing with busy activity. The _Cometara_ rested upon her departure\nstage outside, with a score of workmen conditioning her.\nNewly-installed additional armament was aboard, ready to be assembled\nafter the start. The men to handle it were embarked. My half dozen\nofficers and the ten members of the crew I had already briefly met.\nThey were waiting for me.\n\n\"On we go, Gregg. Let's wish ourselves luck.\" From grim, silent\nabstraction, Grantline had now sprung into his familiar dynamic self.\n\nThere was a solemn group of officers and a hundred or so workmen here;\nthey stopped their fevered labors now to watch the _Cometara_ get\naway, first of Earth's ships speeding into space to confront this\nnameless enemy. Grantline and I went past them with silent handshakes\nand murmured good-bys. I saw the towering figure of Brayley. He raised\nan arm for a farewell gesture to us.\n\nWe mounted the incline to the _Cometara_. She rested upon her stage, a\ngreat, sleek bronze ship, low and rakish, with pointed ends and a\nflattened, arched turtle-back dome of glassite covering the\nsuperstructure and the decks from bow to stern. She lay quiescent,\ngleaming in the glow of the departure beacons; but there was an aspect\nof latent power upon her.\n\nMy ship! My first command! As we went through the opened port of the\ndomeside and I touched foot upon the deck, I prayed that I might\njustify the faith reposed in me.\n\nMen crowded the narrow, covered deck. I saw the space-guns at the deck\npressure-ports, partly assembled. My chief officer, a young fellow\nnamed Drac Davidson, who with his twin brother had been in the\nInterplanetary Freight Service, rushed up to me.\n\n\"We're ready, sir.\"\n\n\"Very good, Drac.\"\n\nHe hurried me to the turret control room. Grantline instantly had\nplunged into details of assembling the weapons.\n\n\"Her ports are all closed,\" said Drac. He spoke calmly, but his thin\nface was pale and his dark eyes glowed with excitement. \"The interior\npressure is set at fifteen pounds. You can ring us up at once.\"\n\nNo formalities to this departure! With pounding heart I entered the\nsmall circular turret and mounted its tiny spiral stairs to the upper\ncontrol room. But as I touched the levers, calmness came to me with\nthese familiar tasks at which I was skilled.\n\nI slid a central-hull gravity-plate. It went smoothly, perfectly\noperated by the magnets. The vessel trembled, lifted; outside the\nenclosing dome I could see the dawn-light of the sky and paling\nfloodlights of the stage. Figures of men out there, made silent\ngestures of farewell, dropping slowly beneath our hull as we lifted.\n\nThe bow gravity-plates slid into the repulsive-force positions. The\nbow lifted. The _Cometara_ responded smoothly. We went up, poised at a\nforty-five degree angle. I saw the outer beacons on the stage swing\nupward with their warning to passing traffic in the lower lanes.\n\n\"Light our bow-beacon, Drac.\"\n\nWe lifted through the lower thousand and two thousand-foot lanes. The\nlights of Tappen were dwindling beneath us. The interior of the\n_Cometara_ was humming with the whirr of its circulators and\nair-receivers, mingled with the throb of air pressure pumps. At three\nthousand feet I started the air-rocket engines. They came on with a\ngentle purring. The fluorescence from them streamed along our hull and\ndown past the stern, like twin rocket tails.\n\nWith gathering speed we slid smoothly upward through the highest\ntraffic lanes, out of the atmosphere, through the stratosphere and\ninto space.\n\nLeaving the stratosphere, I cut off the air-rocket engines, slid the\nstern gravity-plates for the Earth's repulsion and the bow plates for\nthe attraction of the Moon and Sun. The firmament swung, in a slow\narc, and steadied with the Earth behind us and the Sun and Moon in\nadvance of our bow. We were on our course, plunging through space with\naccelerating velocity toward the unknown enemy ship hovering two\nhundred thousand miles ahead of us. My orders were to find the ship\nand maneuver us close to it; and Grantline's orders were to assail it.\n\nI gazed down at the convex North Atlantic with the reddening coastline\nof North America spread like a map.\n\nWhat was the nature of this strange enemy whom we sought? That\nopalescent beam from Greater New York mounted with its radiance into\nthe dome-like starfield; the one from Venus and the other from Mars\nseemed crossing overhead amid the stars.\n\nThree swords crossing the sky! What did they mean?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Will you swing east or west of the Moon?\"\n\n\"We haven't decided.\"\n\nDrac Davidson and I were alone in the _Cometara's_ control turret.\n\nWe were some ten hours out from Earth. Over such short astronomical\ndistances it was impossible to attain any great velocity. When once we\nwere clear of the Earth's atmospheric envelope, the rocket-stream\nengines were useless. The _Cometara_ was equipped also with\ntail-streamers of electronic nature. They exerted a slight pressure,\nuseful for sudden curving and turning; but they had only negligible\ninfluence upon the main velocity of the vehicle.\n\nI used the repulsion of the Earth upon our negatively charged stern\ngravity-plates; and with those of the bow electronified to the\npositive reaction, we were drawn forward by the Sun and the Moon.\n\nFor three or four hours I held to this combination with steady\nacceleration; but then I had to retard. In close quarters such as\nthis, the retarding velocity must be calculated with a nicety many\nhours in advance.\n\nWe hung now, very nearly poised, within some forty thousand miles of\nthe surface of the Moon. Bleak and cold, sharply black and white, it\nhung in a gigantic crescent in advance of our bow. The Sun, whose\nattraction I had ceased using some hours back, was visible sharply to\none side now. Its great gas streams of giant flame licked up into the\nblackness of the firmament. The sunlight caught the lunar mountains\nwith a white glare, and left the valleys black with shadow; moonlight\nand the mingled sunlight painted our bow. Behind our stem the great\ndisk of Earth hung somber and glowing.\n\nAnd everywhere else was the great black enclosing firmament. The stars\nblazed with a new white glory never seen through the haze of an\natmosphere. Like a little world in the vastness of this awesome void,\nwe hung poised.\n\nGrantline came into the turret. \"I've got everything ready, Gregg. By\nthe gods, once you can lay telescope upon that accursed enemy ship,\nI'm ready to open fire on it.\"\n\n\"Good,\" I said.\n\nBut the thought of hurling our bolts at this enemy ship had struck\nterror into my heart for hours past. I was convinced that the three\nwho in all the world were dearest to me--Anita, Venza, and Snap--were\nupon that enemy vessel.\n\nGrantline asked, \"Are you going closer to the Moon?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"The ship couldn't be between us and the Moon. Waters and I have been\nin the helio room for the past hour, searching with the 'scope there.\nNothing doing, Gregg. Not a sign.\"\n\n\"I know. Our instruments here show that.\"\n\n\"There might be a way of sighting them,\" Drac put in.\n\n\"I'll try the Zed-ray,\" I suggested. \"Drac and I have it corrected.\nBut I doubt if it would penetrate the sort of invisibility this enemy\nwould use.\"\n\nGrantline nodded. \"Or the Benson curve-light. You think the ship went\nbehind the Moon? Or landed on the Moon?\"\n\n\"It could have done either. Has Waters still got contact with the\nEarth? Have they seen it?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nI made a sudden decision. It would take us two hours at least to make\na careful scanning with the Zed-ray; and to take an elaborate series\nof spectro-heliographs of the Moon's surface, which might show the\nenemy vessel if it had landed there, was a laborious process.\n\nAfter brief thought, I discarded the idea. \"We'll go to the helio\nroom,\" I told Grantline. \"I'm going to try the Benson curve-light.\"\n\nGrantline and I left the turret, heading along the catwalk under the\nglassite dome toward the helio cubby where the rotund, middle-aged\nWaters was in charge. It made my heart sink to think of the helio\nroom. Snap should have been there.\n\nWe crossed the transverse catwalk. The superstructure roof was under\nus. Farther down, the narrow decks showed with Grantline's men grouped\nat the firing ports, where his weapons were mounted and ready. As I\nsaw those grouped men loitering on the deck, waiting for me to give\nthem a sighting, I prayed I could do so; and yet there was the\nshuddering fear that the first blast would bring death to Anita.\n\nWaters met us at the door of his cubby. His face was red; he mopped\nthe perspiration from his bald head. \"I'm so glad you came! Will you\nwant the Benson-light? I say, I've lost connection with the Earth. I\nhad the Washington transmitter. Five minutes ago they sent me a flash\nof the Mars and Venus news. They both sent ships, out.\"\n\nHe gasped for breath, then added in a rush: \"Both the Mars and Venus\nships were destroyed and the enemy escaped!\"\n\nGrantline and I gasped with horror.\n\n\"Destroyed?\" I said. \"How?\"\n\nWaters did not know. The news came; then, immediately after, the\nWashington transmitter changed its wavelength and he lost connection.\n\n\"But why, in heaven's name, man, didn't you ring and tell us?\"\nGrantline demanded. \"Destroyed--only that! Just destroyed.\"\n\n\"I was afraid to leave my instruments,\" Waters said. \"How could I\ntell? I might be able to renew connections with Washington any minute.\nCome on in. Do you want to try the Benson curve-light, Mr. Haljan?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said. \"I do.\" We entered the dim helio cubby. \"See here,\nWaters, what about the projectile that ascended from Earth last night?\nDid the Washington observatory report what happened to it?\"\n\n\"No, not a word. They lost it, evidently.\"\n\nOur 'scopes on the _Cometara_ had not been able to locate the\nprojectile. The large instruments of Earth had lost it. Was that\nbecause, with tremendous velocity, it had sped directly for the new\nplanet out beyond Mars?\n\nOr, with some form of invisibility, might it be close to us now, just\nas the lurking ship might be somewhere around here?\n\nFrom the little circular helio cubby, perched here under the dome like\nan eagle's nest, I could see down all the length of the ship, and out\nthe side ports of the dome to the blazing firmament. The Sun, Moon and\nEarth and all the starfield were silently turning as Drac swung us\nupon our new course.\n\nWaters bent over the projector of the Benson curve-light, making\nconnections. The cubby was silent and dim, with only a tiny spotlight\nwhere Waters was working, and a glow upon his table where his recent\nmessages from Earth were filed. Grantline and I glanced at them.\n\nPanic in Greater New York, Grebhar, and Ferrok-Shahn. The three\nstrange beams which the enemy had planted on Earth, Venus and Mars\nstill remained unchanged. I could see them now plainly from the helio\ncubby windows, great shafts of radiance sweeping the firmament.\n\nWaters straightened from his task. \"That will do it, Mr. Haljan.\" He\nmet me in the center of the cubby. \"When you locate the enemy, do you\nthink they'll destroy us as they did those other ships?\"\n\nGrantline laughed grimly. \"Maybe so, Waters. But let's hope not.\"\n\nFat little Waters was anything but a coward, but being closed up here\nall these hours with a stream of dire messages from Earth had shaken\nhim.\n\n\"What I mean, Mr. Grantline, is that prudence is sometimes better than\nreckless valor. The _Cometara_ is no warship. If Earth had sent an\ninternational patrol vessel....\"\n\nGrantline did not answer. He joined me at the Benson projector. \"Can\nwe operate it from here, Gregg, or will you mount it in the bow?\"\n\n\"From here. Drac's swinging. When he's on the course I gave him, I can\nthrow the Benson-ray through the bow dome-port. Waters, you're all\ndone in. Go below and sleep awhile.\"\n\nBut he stood his ground. \"No, sir; I don't want to sleep.\"\n\n\"We've had ours,\" said Grantline. \"We'll call you if anything shows\nup.\"\n\nWe sent Waters away. \"Ready, Gregg?\"\n\n\"Yes. I've got the range.\"\n\nThe coils hummed and heated with the current, and in a moment the\nBenson curve-beam leaped from the projector.\n\nThe Benson curve-light was similar to an ordinary white searchlight\nbeam, except that its path, instead of being straight could be bent at\nwill into various curves--hyperbola, parabola, and for its extreme\ncurve, the segment of an ellipse--gradually straightening as it left\nits source. It was effective for police work, with hand torches for\nseeing around opaque obstructions. It had also another advantage,\nespecially when used at long range: the enemy, when gazing back at its\nsource, would under normal circumstances conceive it to be a straight\nbeam and thus be misled as to the location of its source. Or even\nrealizing it to be curved, one had no means of judging the angle of\nthe curve.\n\nA narrow white stream of light, it flung through our window-oval,\nforward under the dome and through the bow dome bullseye, into space.\nI saw the men on the deck spring into sudden alertness with the\nrealization we were using it. The bow lookout on the forward\nobservation bridge crouched at his 'scope-finder to help us search.\n\nFrom the control turret came an audiphone buzz, and Drac's voice: \"Am\nI headed right? The swing is almost completed.\"\n\n\"Finish the job and don't bother me now.\"\n\nI bent over the field-mirror of the projector. On its glowing ten-inch\ngrid the shifting image of my range was visible, a curving, brilliant\nlimb of the Moon, with the sunlight on the jagged mountain peaks;\neverywhere else was the black firmament and the blazing dots of stars.\n\nGrantline crouched beside me. \"I'll work the amplifiers. Going to\nspread it much, Gregg?\"\n\n\"Yes. A full spread first. We're in no mood for a detailed narrow\nsearch.\"\n\nI gradually widened the light. Three feet here at its source, it\nspread in a great widening arc. With the naked eye we could see its\nwhite radiance, fan-shaped as an edge of it fell upon the Moon. And\nthough optically it was not apparent, the elliptical curve of it was\nrounding the Moon, disclosing the hidden starfield to our\ninstruments.\n\n\"Nothing yet?\" I murmured.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"I'll try a narrower spread and less curve.\"\n\nGrantline was searching the magnified images on the series of\namplifier grids. There was nothing. For an hour we worked; then\nsuddenly Grantline cried: \"Gregg! Wait! Hold it!\"\n\nI tensed, stricken. I held the angle and the spread of light steady.\n\n\"Two seconds of arc, east; try that. The damned thing is shifting.\" He\ngripped me. \"It's at the eastern edge of the field; it shifts off. It\nmust be in rapid motion.\"\n\nThen I saw it, a mere moving dot of black; but suddenly it clarified.\nI saw a dot which I could imagine was a shape with discs along its\nedge, moving with high velocity. Grantline was shifting our field to\nhold it.\n\n\"Got it, Gregg. By God, that's it! Now we'll see.\"\n\nThen presently we saw that from its bow a very faint radiant beam was\nstreaming. Beside me I heard Grantline gasp, \"Gregg, am I crazy or is\nthat bow beacon like the light-beam planted in Greater New York?\"\n\nThere did seem to be a similarity, but thought of it abruptly was\nswept from my mind. Our cubby was alive with signals. Both the bow and\nthe stern observers saw the enemy ship now with their 'scopes gazing\ndirectly along our Benson-light. And Drac was calling, \"I've got the\nmeasurement of its velocity. Doubling every ten seconds. God, what\nacceleration!\"\n\nI flung off the Benson-light. The enemy ship had come from behind the\nlimb of the Moon; our straight-light telescopes showed it clearly. It\nwas heading unmistakably in our direction.\n\nDrac was pleading, \"We need velocity! Are you coming to the turret?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nGrantline and I rushed out upon the catwalk. Waters was mounting the\nspiral ladder from the deck. \"Into your cubby,\" I shouted. \"Call\nEarth. Keep calling until you get them.\"\n\nGrantline rushed for the deck. I gained the control turret, Drac, with\nhis thin face white and set, met me at the door. \"We need velocity.\"\n\nI nodded. \"We'll get it, Drac; have no fear of that.\"\n\nI set the gravity-plates for the greatest possible acceleration\nforward and added the stern rocket engines for narrow-angle\nmaneuvering.\n\nWith gathering speed we plunged directly for the oncoming enemy ship.\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n\"But there's something wrong, Drac.\"\n\n\"We've got grade five acceleration.\"\n\nGrantline had joined us in the control turret. \"How far would you say,\nat a rough guess, that ship is from us now?\"\n\n\"Thirty thousand miles; about that.\" Drac scanned his page of\ncalculations. \"Impossible to gauge with any exactness; they change\ntheir pace so often and I can't figure out how large the damn thing\nis.\"\n\n\"Say they've got a forty thousand velocity; added to our ten, that's\nfifty.\"\n\n\"And we're accelerating. In half an hour we'll be within range.\"\n\n\"But there's something wrong,\" I persisted.\n\nFor several minutes now I had been aware that the _Cometara_ was\nacting strangely. A sluggish response to the controls, I thought, but\nwhen I called engine chief Franklin, he had not noticed it. Yet I was\ncertain.\n\nGrantline stared at me. \"Something wrong?\"\n\n\"Yes. Drac, try orienting us. I did it ten minutes ago.\" I shoved him\nat my equations, giving the angles with the Sun, Earth and Moon which\nwe should now have. \"There's our flight course as it ought to be.\nMeasure how we're heading, actual position. If it's what it ought to\nbe, with the plate-combinations I'm using, then I'm crazy.\"\n\n\"Oh, you're just naturally apprehensive,\" Grantline said.\n\nBut we were not where we should be. The _Cometara_ was off her\npredetermined course. And then I realized the factor of error. There\nwas a gravitational force here for which I was not allowing. The\nerror was not within the _Cometara_; she was responding perfectly. But\nthere was a force upon her, and not that of the Sun, Earth, Moon or\nthe distant starfield. I had calculated all of these. It was something\nelse. Some gravitational pull, so that we were not upon the course of\nflight we should have been on.\n\n\"But what could be wrong?\" Grantline demanded.\n\nIt was Drac who guessed it. \"That radiance from the enemy's bow?\"\n\nIt was that, we felt certain. Even at this thirty thousand mile\ndistance, the bow-beacon seemed streaming upon us. We could not see\nthat it illumined the _Cometara_, nor could our instruments measure\nany added illumination. Our flight-orbit, if held, would carry us with\na swing some ten thousand miles above the South Pole of the Moon. It\nwould cross diagonally in front of the trajectory that the enemy\nvessel was maintaining. But we were off our predetermined course, with\na side-drift toward the enemy. That bow-beacon radiance was exerting a\nforce upon us, a strange gravitational pull.\n\nGrantline gasped when Drac said it. \"If it's that now, what will it be\nwhen we get closer?\"\n\nThe minutes were passing. The thirty thousand miles between us and the\nenemy was cut to ten thousand; to five. The ship was soon visible to\nthe naked eye. Its visual movement, for all this time measurable only\nas a drift upon the amplified images of our instruments, now was\nobvious. We could see it plunging forward, could see that probably we\nwould cross its bow. Within fifty miles? We hoped and guessed that\nwould be the result, so that with this first passing we could use our\nweapons. Fifty miles of distance at combined speeds of some fifty\nthousand miles an hour: that would be something like three seconds\nfrom a collision. The danger of a collision, which both ships would do\nanything to avert, was negligible; in the immensity of space two\nobjects so small could not strike each other, even with intention,\nonce in a million times.\n\nWe could not calculate the passing so closely, but suddenly it seemed\nthat perhaps the enemy could. The bow-beacon radiance, so obviously a\nminiature of the weird light-beams streaming from Earth, Mars and\nVenus, now swung away from us and was extinguished. Whatever\nalteration of our course the enemy had made, they seemed to be\nsatisfied. The passing would be to their liking. Would it be to ours?\n\nGrantline had left the turret. He was down on the deck, ready with his\nmen. The weapons were ready.\n\nWe had long since advanced beyond the possibility of mathematical\ncalculations keeping pace with our changing position in relation to\nthe enemy, but it seemed that the passing would be within fifty miles.\nGrantline's weapons would carry their bolt that far.\n\nIt was barely two thousand miles away now. Two minutes of time before\nthe passing. I stared at it, a long, low ship of dark metal, red where\nthe moonlight struck upon it. I estimated its size to be about that of\nthe _Cometara_, but it was much more nearly globular. Upon its top,\nseeming to project from the terraced dome, was an up-pointing funnel,\nlike the smokestack of an old-fashioned surface steam vessel; or like\na great black muzzle of an old-fashioned gun. And in a row along the\nbulging middle of the hull there was a series of little discs.\n\nThe vessel was still a tiny blob, but every instant it was enlarging,\ndoubling its visual size. Drac said tensely, \"Fifteen hundred miles!\nWe'll pass in a minute and a half.\"\n\nI turned the angle of the stern rocket-streams. The firmament slowly\nbegan swinging; the enemy ship seemed swaying up over us. I was\nturning our top to it, so that Grantline might fire directly upward\nfrom both sides almost simultaneously. It might be possible, if I\ncould roll us over at just the proper seconds.\n\nBut the enemy anticipated us. As they observed our roll, again the\nbow-beacon flashed on. It visibly struck us, bathed all our length in\nits spreading opalescent radiance.\n\nIt seemed for an instant to do nothing. Our dome did not crack; there\nwas no shock. But our side-roll slowed. The heavens stopped their\nswing, and then swung back! We were upon an even keel again, the enemy\nlevel with our bow. Against the force of my turning rocket-streams\nthis radiation had righted us. It clung a few seconds more, and again\nvanished.\n\nGrantline's deck audiphone rang with his startled voice: \"Gregg, roll\nus over! Quick! I can only fire from one side.\"\n\n\"I can't.\"\n\nIt was too late now. A few hundred miles of distance! Drac stood\nclutching me, staring through the port. And I stared, breathless,\nawaiting the results of these next few seconds.\n\nThe ships passed like crossing, speeding meteors. A few seconds of\nfinal approach; I saw the enemy vessel as an elongated, flattened\nglobe, with a triple-terraced dome and terraced decks beneath it. That\nqueer stack on top! The round discs, like ten-foot eyes, gleamed along\nthe equator of the bulging hull.\n\nOne of Grantline's weapons fired a silent flash. Still out of range.\nThe spit of our electrons leaped from our side. The enemy was\nuntouched.\n\nThe thought stabbed at me: _Anita! Not killed by that one._\n\nAnother shot from Grantline.\n\nNo result. It seemed that I saw the bolt strike. There was a\nreddening, a flash upon that bulging hull, but nothing more.\n\nI was aware again of the enemy bow-beam swinging upon us. The beam was\npressing us over again so that in a moment we would be hull-bottom to\nthe enemy and Grantline could not fire.\n\nHe anticipated it. The ship was broadside to us. In the split second\nof that passing I saw that it was not fifty miles away, hardly ten.\nGrantline flung his remaining bolts. The enemy was a streaked blur\ngoing by; and all in that second it was past, reddening in the\ndistance. Untouched by our bolts? It seemed so. The bow radiance\ndarted ahead of it. The globular shape, unharmed, dwindled in the\ndistance behind us.\n\nAnd it had done nothing to us!\n\nThe control levers were in my hands. I would shift the gravity-plates,\nand make the quickest turn we could. We would go around the Moon,\nprobably, and come back within an hour or two. Perhaps our adversary\nwould also turn to encounter us again.\n\nAt that second I had not seen the little discs, but I saw them now!\nThey came sailing in a line, ten foot, flat, circular discs of a dark\nmetal; they gleamed reddish where the sunlight painted them. They had\nbeen fastened outside the enemy vessel and in our passing they had\nbeen discharged. They sailed now like whirling plates. There seemed\nperhaps twenty of them, heading in a curve toward us.\n\nGrantline's voice came again from the deck audiphone. \"Missed them,\nGregg. That's what I thought but at least two of our bolts must have\nstruck. But it didn't hurt them.\"\n\n\"No,\" I replied. \"It seemed not. They must have a defensive barrage.\"\n\nDrac was pulling at me. \"Those things out there, those discs....\"\n\nGrantline demanded, \"Yes, what in hell are they?\"\n\nWe could not tell. It seemed that their curve would take them behind\nour stern. Grantline added: \"Will you try going back after that ship?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nBut I did not. To the naked eye the enemy ship had already\ndisappeared; but with the 'scopes we saw that it seemed to be turning.\n\nI did not attempt to turn us, for we were afraid of those oncoming\ndiscs which took all our attention. They passed within five miles\nastern of us, but in a great curve they swung and now seemed heading\nacross our bow. With what tremendous velocity they had been endowed by\ntheir firing mechanisms! Their elliptical curve swung them a mile or\nso ahead of us.\n\nThey were circling us like tiny satellites in a narrowing spiral\nellipse. Our attraction, the normal gravity of our close bulk, was\ndrawing them to us.\n\nThe men on the _Cometara's_ deck stood gazing, surprised but not yet\nalarmed. The lookout calls sounded with routine notification each time\nthe discs passed across our bow and stern. In the helio cubby, Waters\nwas still trying to raise an Earth station.\n\nGrantline came running to the control turret. \"If those cursed things,\nshould strike us, Gregg!\"\n\nI had set the gravity-plates into new combinations, turning our course\ndownward, trying to swing us under the plane of the discs' orbit. But\nthey swung downward with us; they were no more than two thousand feet\naway now.\n\nGrantline said, \"At the next broadside passing I'll fire at them.\"\n\nDrac looked up from his calculating instruments. \"Look! A circular\nrotation: Horribly swift. But I've caught a picture. Look!\"\n\nHe had a still image of one of the discs. It had saw-teeth at its thin\nknife-like outer circumference. Whirling at tremendous speed, these\nsaw-toothed metal discs might cut into our dome, or some other part of\nour ship.\n\nAt the next round, Grantline fired. The discs reddened a little, but\ncame on unharmed. From the other side, he fired again. Three of the\ndiscs seemed to have been caught full. His bolts, sustained for their\nfullest ten seconds of duration at this close, thousand-foot range,\ntook effect. The three discs seemed to crumble with a puff of\nqueerly-radiant vacuum spark-glows, then were gone.\n\nBut the others came closing in.\n\nThe _Cometara_ rang now with the excitement and alarm of the men.\nGrantline could not set his gauges fast enough to fire at every round.\n\nI had a sudden thought. With the rear rockets, I rolled us over. For a\nmoment we were hull-down to the passing discs. From our hull\ngravity-plates I flung a full repulsion. Would it stave them off, bend\ntheir orbit outward? It did not. Their course was unaltered.\n\nAgain Grantline was shouting at me, \"Roll us back! I must fire!\"\n\nIt had been an error, that rolling; Grantline lost several shots\nbecause of it. I swung us level. The discs passed within a hundred\nfeet; half a dozen of them were still closer. Gleaming, whirling\ncircles, thin as knife-blades; they passed close under our stern, came\nbroadside.\n\nThese were tense, horrible seconds. The discs skimmed our bow; one\nseemed to miss our dome by inches. Grantline's volley annihilated four\nmore, but there were still eight of them. They swung in at our stern.\n\nI was aware of confusion throughout the _Cometara_. The crew and\nstewards were running up to the bow quarter-deck. My second officer\nstood there, stricken. The stern lookout screamed his futile warning.\n\nUseless! I saw one of the discs strike our stern dome, then another.\nStill others. They were silent blows, but it seemed that I could feel\nthem cutting into the dome-plates.\n\nThe dome was cracking! Then, after that horrible instant, came the\nsound: crunch, a rumble; the grind of crushed and breaking metal;\nthen the puff and surge of the outward explosion.\n\nI saw the whole tip of the stern dome cracking, bursting outward,\nforced by our interior air pressure. And over all the _Cometara_ the\noutgoing air was sucking and whining with a growing rush of wind.\n\nI shouted, \"Drac! Close the stern bulkhead!\"\n\nI set the word-buttons for the distress siren, and pulled the lever.\nIts voice screamed over the uproar. \"_Keep forward! Take the\nspace-suits! Prepare to abandon ship!_\"\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nIn the midst of the chaos I was aware that all the remaining discs\nstruck us upon the port stern quarter. The broken dome of the stern\nshowed a jagged hole, but the up-sliding cross-bulkhead partially shut\nit off. Two or three of the crew and the stern lookout were gone\nbehind that closing bulkhead. Their bodies in a moment would be blown\ninto space.\n\n\"It may hold, Drac. Order Waters out of his cubby. Forward!\"\n\nI was calling the engine-room. \"Order your men up by the bow, not the\nstern.\" But I got no answer from the engine-chief.\n\nI raised Grantline. \"Order your men forward: Clear amidships! I want\nto close the central bulkheads. If the stern one breaks with the\npressure....\"\n\n\"Right, Gregg. Are we lost?\"\n\n\"God knows! We'll know in a minute or two. Get all your men into their\nspace-suits. Keep in the bow. Prepare the exit-port there.\"\n\n\"Right, Gregg. You coming down?\"\n\n\"Yes. When I finish.\" I cut him off. \"Drac, get out of here! Did you\norder Waters forward?\"\n\n\"He won't leave.\"\n\n\"Why the hell not?\"\n\n\"He thinks he may be able to get communication with Earth.\"\n\n\"He can't stay where he is; there's no protection up here! When that\nstern bulkhead goes....\"\n\nIt was breaking. I could see it bending sternward under the pressure.\nAnd at best it was leaking air, so that the decks were a rush of wind.\nAlready Drac and I were gasping with the lowered pressure.\n\n\"Drac, get out of here. Go get Waters; bring him forward. The hell\nwith his transmitter: this is life or death!\"\n\n\"But you?\"\n\n\"I'm coming down. From the forward deck, call the hull control rooms.\nOrder everybody forward and to the deck.\"\n\n\"What about the pressure pumps?\"\n\n\"I can keep them going from here.\"\n\nI set the circulating system to guide the fresh air forward, but it\nwas futile against the sucking rush of wind toward the stern. As the\npumps speeded up I saw, with the little added pressure, the great\ncross panel of the stern bulkhead straining harder. It would go in a\nmoment.\n\nDrac was clinging to me. \"Tell me what to do!\"\n\n\"I've told you what to do!\" I shoved him to the catwalk. \"Get out of\nhere. Get Waters forward. Get the men out of the hull.\"\n\nHis anguished eyes stared at me; then he turned and ran forward on the\ncatwalk. I saw him forcibly dragging the bald-headed Waters from the\nhelio cubby. It was the last time I ever saw either of them.\n\nA buzzer was ringing in the turret, and I plunged back for it. The\nexertion put a band of pain across my chest, a panting constriction\nfrom the lowering pressure.\n\nFanning, assistant engineer, was still at the pressure pumps. His\nvoice came up: \"Pumps and renewers working. Will you use the gravity\nshifters?\"\n\n\"Hell, no! Get out of there, Fanning. We're smashed. Air going. It's a\nmatter of minutes--abandoning ship. Get forward!\"\n\nSuddenly the stern bulkhead cracked with a great diagonal rift. I\nwaited a moment to give them all time to get forward; then I slid all\nthe cross 'midship bulkheads.\n\nIt was barely in time. The stern bulkhead went out with a gale of\nwind, but the barrier amidships stemmed it. Half of the vessel\nsternward was devoid of air, but here in the bow we could last a\nlittle longer. Beneath me I could see Grantline's men--some of them,\nnot all--and a few of the stewards, crew and officers, crowding the\ndeck, donning space-suits. The two side chambers were ready; half a\ndozen men crowded into each of them. The deck doors slid closed. The\nouter ports opened; helmeted, goggled, bloated figures were blown by\nthe outgoing air from the chamber into space. Then the outer slides\nwent closed. The pumps filled up the chambers; the deck doors opened\nagain. Another batch of men....\n\nI saw Grantline, suited but with his helmet off, dashing from one side\nof the deck to the other, commanding the abandonment.\n\nThe central bulkheads seemed momentarily holding. Then little red\nlights in the panel board before me showed where in the hull corridors\nthe doors were leaking, cracking, giving away, breaking under the\nstrain. The whole ribbed framework of the vessel was strained and\nslued. The bulkhead sides no longer set true in the casements. Air was\nwhining everywhere and pulling sternward.\n\nIt was the last stand; I was aware that the alarm siren had ceased.\nThere was a sudden stillness, with only the shouts of the remaining\nmen at the exit-ports mingling with the whine of the wind and the\nroaring in my head. I felt detached, far-away; my senses were reeling.\n\nI staggered to the gauges of the Erentz system, the system whereby an\noscillating current, circling within the double-shelled walls of hull\nand dome, absorbed into negative energy much of the interior pressure.\nThe main walls of the vessel were straining outward. The _Cometara_\ncould collapse at any moment. I started for the catwalk door. The\nelectro-telescope stood near it and I yielded to a vague desire to\ngaze into the eyepiece. The instrument was still operative. I swept it\nsternward.\n\nThe enemy ship had not vanished. By what strange means, I cannot say,\nits velocity had been checked. A few thousand miles from us, it was\nmaking a narrow, close-angle turn. Coming back? I thought so.\n\nI suddenly realized my intention of having all the gravity-plates in\nneutral before abandoning the ship. I seized the controls now. An\nagony of fear was upon me that the shifting valves would fail. But\nthey did not. The plates slid haltingly, reluctantly.\n\nI recall staggering to the catwalk. It seemed that the central\nbulkhead was breaking. There were fallen figures on the deck beneath\nme. I stumbled against the body of a man who had tangled himself in\nthe stays of the ladder rail and was hanging there.\n\nI think I fell the last ten feet to the deck. The roaring in my ears,\nthe bands tightening about my chest encompassed all the world.\n\nThen I was on my feet again, and I stumbled over another body. It was\ngarbed in a space-suit, with the helmet beside it. I stripped it of\nthe suit. I was panting, with all the world whirling in a daze,\nbursting spots of light before my eyes.\n\nTen feet away down the deck was the opened door of the pressure\nchamber. A bloated figure came into my dreamlike vista, moving for the\npressure door. It turned, saw me, came leaping and bent over me. I saw\nbehind the vizor that it was Grantline. His bloated, gloved hands\nhelped me don my suit.\n\nHe helped me with my helmet. The metal tip on Grantline's gloved hand\ntouched the contact-plate on my shoulder. His voice sounded from the\ntiny audiphone grid within my helmet. \"Gregg! Thank God I found you!\nAll right?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" My head was clearing.\n\n\"I've got the chamber ready. We're the last, Gregg.\"\n\nI gripped his shoulder. \"You're sure there's nobody else?\"\n\n\"No. I've been everywhere I could reach. The central bulkheads are\nalmost gone.\"\n\nHe pushed me into the pressure chamber. There was hardly need to close\nthe door after us. I stood gripping him as he opened the small outer\nslides. The abyss was at our feet; the outgoing wind tore at us like a\ngale, so that we stood gripping the casements.\n\n\"Thank God you've got a power-suit, Gregg. So have I. We must keep\ntogether.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nI could feel the floor grid of the chamber shuddering beneath my feet.\nThe _Cometara_ was cracking, bursting outward throughout her length;\nat any instant she might collapse.\n\nFor a moment we stood poised. Beneath us, here at the brink were\nmillions upon millions of miles of emptiness, the remote, unfathomable\nvoid. Blazing worlds down there in the black darkness.\n\n\"Good-by, Gregg. It may be the end for us.\"\n\n\"Good luck, Johnny.\"\n\nHis bloated figure dropped away from me. I waited just an instant, and\nthen I dove into space.\n\nFor a moment there was a chaos of strangeness, the wrench to my sense\nof the transition. I had been the inhabitant of a little world, the\n_Cometara_, with a gravity beneath my feet. Now, in a breath, I had no\nworld to inhabit. I was alone in space. No gravity; nothing solid to\ntouch; emptiness.\n\nI was in a world to myself, and the abnormality of it brought a mental\nshock. But in a moment the adjustment came. I passed the transition,\nthe sense of falling.\n\nThe firmament steadied and my senses cleared. My dive from the\n_Cometara_ carried me in a slow arc some three hundred feet away.\nThere had been a sense of falling, but no actual fall. My velocity was\nretarded, with the mass of the _Cometara_ pulling at me. I went like a\ntoy boat in water shoved by a child, quickly slowing. In a few\nmoments, the velocity was gone, and I hung poised. I saw Grantline's\nbloated form not over fifty feet from me. He waved an arm at me.\n\nOut here in the void I lay weightless, as though upon an infinitely\nsoft feather bed. I could kick, flounder, but not endow myself with\nmotion. I craned my neck, gazed around through the bulging vizor pane.\n\nThe Earth and the Sun hung level with the white star-dots strewn\neverywhere. I could not see that unknown light-beam from Greater New\nYork; it was shafting out now in the other direction, so that the\nEarth hid it from me. Venus was visible to one side of the Sun. The\nenemy light-stream from Grebhar was apparent; and as I turned my body\nand bent double to look behind me, I saw Mars and the sword-like ray\nfrom Ferrok-Shahn. The beams streamed off like the radiance of the\nMilky Way, faintly luminous but seemingly visible for an infinite\ndistance.\n\nThe _Cometara_ was obviously falling now toward the Moon, drawn\nirresistibly, and all of us with her, toward the lunar surface. It\nseemed so close, that black and white mountainous disc. We were, I\nsuppose, some twenty thousand miles from it, gathering speed as it\npulled at us. But that motion was not apparent now. Distance dwindled\nall these celestial motions, so that all the firmament seemed frozen\ninto immobility.\n\nBut there was some motion. Twenty or more bloated figures, the\nsurvivors from the wreck of the _Cometara_, were encircling it in\nvarying orbits, revolving around it like tiny satellites. Some were\nclosing in, drawn against it. I saw one plunge against the wrecked\ndome, and begin crawling like a fly. And I found that the forces of\nthe firmament were molding my orbit also. My outward plunge was\nchecked. I poised for an indeterminate instant, and then I took my\norbit. I too, was a satellite of the _Cometara_.\n\nI gazed at the wreck of the _Cometara_. My ship! My first command! So\nsmoothly, confidently rising from the Earth only a few hours ago; and\nshe had come to this. She lay askew in the heavens. The dome was\ncracked throughout all its length and smashed like a shell at the\nsterntip.\n\nI could see the interior litter beneath the dome, the twisted and\nstrained lines of the hull. A dead ship now, the mechanisms stilled;\ndead and silent inside, with all the warmth gone out of it. All the\nair dissipated, so that in every cubby, every dark corridor of that\nbroken hull there was the coldness and silence of interplanetary\nspace.\n\nI suppose these thoughts swept me within a few seconds. I saw myself\nstarting to revolve in my orbit. Perhaps my motion would carry me\naround indefinitely; or I might be drawn down to the vessel as those\nother survivors had been drawn.\n\nGrantline, with one of the few power suits, was coming toward me now,\nwith tiny fluorescent streams back along his body from his shoulder\nblades. I switched on my own mechanism. It moved me toward him, and\nour gravity attracted us. We shut off the power when twenty feet\napart; drifted together; contacted; bounced apart like rubber balls as\nour inflated suits struck. Then in a moment we had drifted back and\nclung.\n\nI touched the metal plate of his shoulder. \"Working all right?\"\n\n\"Yes. Thank God for this much, Gregg. I wonder how many are alive.\"\n\nIn the chaos of the abandonment, many of the men's air mechanisms had\nfailed to operate. It is always so in times of disaster. We could see,\nrevolving around the wreck, and motionless against its dome, those\nhorrible flabby, deflated suits where the delicate Erentz mechanism\nhad failed. Within was only a corpse.\n\n\"Too many,\" I said. \"And not more than four or five of us with power.\nWhat shall we do first? Round them up? We must all get together.\"\n\nHis answering voice was grim. \"We can tow them from the wreck. Six or\nseven of us altogether have power. Do you suppose we can get away,\nGregg? Get loose from the ship before she falls?\"\n\nOnly trying it could tell us that. The _Cometara_, and all of us with\nher, were plunging for the Moon. We would seek out the men who were\nalive and tow them in a string. If we could break the gravity pull of\nthe ship, and then struggle upward from the Moon, we could maintain\nourselves here in space until some rescue ship from Earth, Venus or\nMars would come and pick us up.\n\n\"You take one side, Gregg; I'll take the other. Don't go aboard; she\nmight collapse.\"\n\n\"I'll pick up the men without power and alive. The others with power\nsuits will do the same. Then we'll meet out here, about where we are\nnow?\"\n\n\"Yes. And hurry, Gregg! Every mile toward the Moon makes it that much\nharder. We're falling fast.\"\n\n\"Good luck!\" I shoved away from him. And within a minute, as he went\nin an arc toward the _Cometara_ bow and I toward her stern, I suddenly\nthought of that returning enemy vessel. My last look through the\n'scope had shown that she was returning; and then I had forgotten it.\n\nMy gaze swept the firmament now. I had no 'scope instruments within\nthe helmet. With the naked eye the enemy ship was not in sight. But I\nknew that meant little; within a moment she could come in view and be\nhere if she were going at any great velocity.\n\nThere were on the _Cometara_, at the time of the disaster, some\nsixty-odd men; perhaps forty had gotten away. And I could see very\nsoon that not more than fifteen, or less, out here were alive. Two\nwith power were ahead of me now, slowly floating past the wrecked dome\nof the stern. One had picked up two others, found them alive and was\ntowing them out. They went past me, moving very slowly so that I could\nsee that two were all that one of us could tow and attain any velocity\nat all.\n\nI contacted with the leader. He was one of Grantline's men.\n\n\"Two or three hundred feet out,\" I directed. I gestured. \"Grantline\nsaid to meet out there. I'll tow others.\"\n\n\"Yes. Around the stern you'll find--God! Haljan, look!\"\n\nA mile from us the enemy ship was in view. Passing--no! Stopping! With\nincredible retardation she had plunged into view, was here, and yet\nhad no great forward velocity. She seemed no more rapid than a great\nair liner winging past, so close that her reddish-tinged bulging hull\nlength showed clearly. The discs were gone. The funnel set on top of\nher was sloped diagonally toward us as she rolled on her side, so that\nmomentarily I could see down into it. There was some mechanism down\nthere. The bow radiance was a narrow opalescent beam in advance of the\nbow.\n\n\"Slowing, Haljan!\"\n\n\"Yes, stopping. Don't try to meet Grantline. Tow your men away!\"\n\n\"Or should we board the _Cometara_ and hide?\"\n\n\"No. They've come back to bombard her.\"\n\nI kicked at him violently. With his two drifting figures clinging\nbehind, he swung past me. I headed behind the stern. Upon its dangling\nframework several of our men were glued, lying there inert. I caught a\nglimpse of the interior of the stern, the littered deck; men lying\nthere had been stricken before they had time to get into their suits.\n\nOn the outside, forward, I saw Grantline come rounding the bow, towing\na figure and heading for another. On the outside of the bow-peak a\ngroup of others were perched, gesticulating for help. I started that\nway; then I saw another, and nearer figure in a power suit heading for\nthem. I swung back. There were two figures on the outside of the\nunder-hull whom I could more quickly reach. Inverted flies. Their feet\nwere on the keel. They stooped and waved toward me.\n\nI took a swoop. Passing close down the hull, my rocket-streams struck\nthe hull plates and gave me sudden downward velocity. I shot down, out\npast the keel. And again I saw the enemy ship. She hung poised, no\nmore than two miles away. And as I looped over, with all the black,\nstar-strewn firmament in a dizzy whirl, the great Moon-disc, first\nabove, and then below me, I saw the bow-beam of the enemy swinging. It\ncame to the _Cometara_, and there it clung.\n\nI had gone perhaps fifty feet below the keel with my dive when I\nrighted. I was mounting. I saw the opalescent ten-foot circle of the\nbeam moving along the _Cometara_ hull. It seemed to do no damage; then\nsuddenly it darted down and clung to me.\n\nI felt nothing save the impact of a gentle push, something shoving\nwith a ponderable force against me.\n\nI saw the _Cometara_ receding, the heavens swinging as I turned over.\nThe red disc of the distant Earth swooped. The Moon surface\nmomentarily seemed rotating and lifting above me.\n\nI was helpless, rolling, then whirling end-over-end. Then again I\nsteadied. The beam was gone from me.\n\nI saw the _Cometara_, a full mile away from me! The enemy ship was\nagain in motion, moving toward me, and between the _Cometara_ and the\nEarth. And the beam was steady upon the _Cometara's_ mid-section.\n\nThe _Cometara_ had a new velocity now. I could not miss it. She was\ndwindling rapidly in visual size; relative to me, she was receding,\nfalling upon the Moon. More than that she was being pushed downward by\nthe repulsive force of the strange enemy beam upon her. I stared, as\nwith all the little dots which were our men around and upon her, she\nwent down into the void.\n\nI found myself presently alone up here, with the enemy ship hovering\nnearby. Its maneuvering to thrust the wrecked _Cometara_ toward the\nMoon had brought it within a mile of me. The bow-beam was still on the\n_Cometara_; and then abruptly it vanished.\n\nThe _Cometara_ had almost dwindled beyond the sight of my unaided\nvision. By chance, undoubtedly, the beam had fallen upon me and thrust\nme from the wreck. I was alone up here now with the enemy, but they\nmay not have noticed me, or cared. I found my power mechanism intact.\nI turned it on; slowly, like a log in water, I began moving away.\n\nA minute. Five minutes. The _Cometara_ was lost. Grantline, all the\nmen, were lost; with that added downward thrust they could never free\nthemselves from the falling wreck.\n\nI was jerked out of my thoughts by the sight of an oncoming red blob.\nSomething was coming from the enemy ship, red with the sunlight and\nearthlight, silvered by the Moon and the stars. It took form. It was a\ndisc, another of those cursed whirling discs, sent to annihilate me!\n\nThen, when it was a quarter of a mile away, I saw that it was a disc\nwhich was turning slowly. Rocket radiances came from its rotating\ncircumference; it came sailing directly at me, so swiftly that my own\nvelocity was futile.\n\nAnother minute and I was caught. I saw that the disc was some fifteen\nfeet in diameter, and that it bulged, so that within its convex floor\nand ceiling was a space of several feet.\n\nI cut off my power and with pounding heart lay waiting. The space-suit\nhad no weapons for equipment save a knife hung in the belt. I drew it\nout, held it in my gloved fingers.\n\nThe disc sailed upon its level, vertical axis. Its rotation slowed; I\nsaw little windows set around its convex middle. It came up and bumped\nme with its metal side. I kicked away, shoved off. Shapes were moving\nin a dim interior light behind the port-panes. Little hand-beams of\nradiance darted out. They seemed to seize me, draw me.\n\nI found myself glued helplessly to the convex outer surface of the\ndisc. The rotation gathered speed again, but I looked presently only\nat the gleaming surface to which I was pinned. Had I been a metal bar\nupon the horns of an electro-magnet, I could not have been more\nhelpless.\n\nAn interval passed. With the contact plate of my fingers against this\nhull it seemed that I could hear voices within, strange,\nindistinguishable words. I twisted, but could not see into the port.\n\nAgain the rotation was slowing. The near shape of the enemy vessel\nswung close and past; and again and again I saw that we were over it,\ndropping down into the wide black opening of the funnel-top. It yawned\npresently like a great black tunnel, into which we fell.\n\nThe jar of landing knocked me loose, and no doubt the attraction\nradiance also released me. I fell another space, bounced up and sank\nback. I thought that something like a sliding port-door closed over\nme.\n\nAnd then, in the dimness, figures were gripping me. I lashed and\nstruck, but the knife was wrenched away.\n\nI was a prisoner in a pressure-port of the enemy ship!\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nIt seemed that the small room had a very faint radiance showing\nthrough my vizor pane. Narrow enclosing walls were visible. It was a\ntriangular-shaped space, fifteen feet or so down one side, with a\nconcave ceiling overhead. I was lying on the floor. The darkness at\nfirst had been impenetrable. The figures which had flung me down and\nseized my knife were gone; I had not seen them nor where they went.\n\nFor a moment I lay cushioned by my bloated suit. When I struggled to\nmy feet, I was almost weightless. The movement of getting upright\nflung me upward as though I were a tossed feather. My helmet struck\nthe metal ceiling, so sharp a blow that I feared for an instant I had\nsmashed the helmet.\n\nFrom the ceiling, with flailing arms and legs, I sank back to the\ngrid-floor; and in a moment I was able to stand upright with so slight\na feeling of weight that I could have been a bit of thistle ready to\nblow away in the least wind.\n\nThere was, as I stood there balancing myself, a queer feeling of\ntriumph within me. A triumphant hope; for coming down in the ship's\ncapacious funnel--larger than it had seemed from a distance--I had\nseen what appeared to be a small projectile, resting in some strange\nlanding gear. The disc bearing me had settled on a stage alongside it.\nWas that the projectile from Earth?\n\nA growing air pressure was around me; the tiny Erentz dials within my\nhelmet had been immovable, but now they were showing outside pressure. I\nstood waiting. Whatever sounds were here I could not tell. Then\npresently the dials stopped. They registered seventeen pounds--whatever\nthat might mean here. I loosed the helmet and took it off.\n\nWith the first gasping breath my senses reeled. I sank to the floor,\nand though I tried to replace the helmet, it was too late. My thoughts\nwere fading. A strange chemical odor was in my nostrils. It was like\nbreathing a thin, perfumed water.\n\nThe drifting away was pleasant.\n\nTortured dreams came with my awakening. I found myself in the same dim\nroom upon the floor. I could breathe better now, and in a few more\nhours the strangeness had almost gone. I found now that I was not\ninjured, but I was ravenously hungry.\n\nAgain, gingerly as before, I stood up and slid my space-suit from me;\nand now I was aware of movement and sound. The floor-grid vibrations\nwere apparent. And there was a dim, distant, tiny throbbing; it was\nmuch like the interior of the _Cometara_ while in flight.\n\nAnd there were other sounds, indescribably faint, yet strangely clear.\nI thought they might be distant voices.\n\nI took a cautious step. I could see a dim blank wall nearby with what\nseemed a bowl-like article of furniture on the floor against the wall.\nFor all my caution, I sailed upward; but this time I held my balance.\nAnd I found that with my negligible weight, I could almost swim in\nthis strange air! I hit the wall and slid slowly down it to the floor\nagain, like a man sinking to the bottom of a tank.\n\nIt suddenly occurred to me to put my ear against the wall. At once the\nsounds all became incredibly louder. It was a confusion of sound: the\nmechanisms of the vessel, some of which I thought I could identify,\nand some not; the strange swish and thump of what might have been\npeople moving; and there were voices.\n\nThe voices seemed mingled babble coming from everywhere. The timber of\nthe sound was very strange. It held no suggestion of how far away from\nme the voices might be. There were so many of them I could only think\nthey were scattered about the ship; and yet they all seemed together.\nAfter a moment, the blend was less confusing. Again, very strangely my\nhearing seemed able to separate one from the other.\n\nI was to learn that the atmosphere handled sound vibrations\ndifferently from that of Earth. Voices had a muffled tone, as though\nthey were smothered. There was undoubtedly a vibrational distortion;\nand a sound-wave speed slower than Earth's normal-pressure rate of\n1,050 feet a second, perhaps as slow as 700. Yet sounds remained\naudible over longer distances than on Earth.\n\nIn this instance now, as I listened with my ear to the wall of the\nship, I was hearing all its sounds picked up and carried by the metal.\n\nNow I heard a strange tongue: two types of voices, slow, measured,\ncarefully-intoned phrases, and voices of a curiously sepulchral,\nhollow sound. My mind went back to the Red Spark restaurant room.\n\nAnd suddenly I realized that amid the babble I was hearing English. A\nman's voice, talking English. I caught, very clearly the phrase:\n\n\"Master, yes. She means well. Can you not see it?\"\n\nMolo's voice! Then the girls must be here also.\n\nAnother voice: \"I am not sure. Perhaps. The Great Intelligence will\ntalk with her when we are arrived.\" It was the slow measured voice of\none of the brains.\n\n\"When will that be? Pretty soon now, won't it, Molo?\"\n\nVenza! A great wave of thankfulness swept me. And then I heard Anita.\n\"Your two captives, where are they? You're not going to kill them, are\nyou?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Molo. \"Perhaps not. No one has inspected the new one yet.\nThe other is being cared for. The Great Intelligence will question him\nwhen we arrive.\"\n\n\"We are arriving,\" said Venza. \"That's your world, Wandl, down there,\nisn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes. We are dropping fast.\"\n\nThe voice of the brain: \"Come, Wyk. The instruments are showing events\non our captured worlds. Take me to watch. I am tired of movement.\"\n\n\"Yes. Master.\"\n\nIt seemed that the brain was being carried away; Molo and the two\ngirls were being left alone. I had thought at first that they were in\nthe adjacent room to me, but they could have been far distant. They\nhad mentioned two captives. One, obviously, was myself. Was the other\nSnap?\n\n\"Come,\" Molo was saying, \"stand here with me and we will watch this\nworld. Not mine, Venza _chia_, as you just called it, But my adopted\nworld. And it will be yours, until we rule the new Mars.\"\n\nI heard them moving to gaze through the window-port. Then came Anita's\nvoice: \"If it's anything like this ship, it will be very strange.\"\n\n\"Strange indeed, little dove. I was there only once, a month ago, and\nfor a few hours only. The Great Intelligence, as they call him, talked\nwith me, absorbing my knowledge: they call it that. And he was much\nimpressed by me, and made very wonderful promises in exchange for my\nfidelity. And for my sister, too.\"\n\nI learned further how Molo and Meka became identified with the\nWandlites; it was as we had suspected.\n\n\"You will rule Mars?\" Venza was saying. \"When this is over, you mean\nyou will really be given Mars to rule?\"\n\n\"I would rather live on the Earth,\" said Anita. \"There was a young man\nthere.\"\n\n\"He will not be there much longer.\" Molo laughed. \"You are very lucky\nthat I fancy you!\"\n\n\"Lucky indeed,\" Venza echoed. \"No death for me. I'm too young.\"\n\n\"But all those millions dead. It seems so terrible.\"\n\n\"It is, for them!\" Molo was in high good humor, pleased with himself\nand with these girls. \"See down there; that blurring is the heavy air.\nWe're almost down into it now.\"\n\nI heard the sound of someone joining them, and then the hollow voice\nagain: \"Molo! Bad tidings come from Mars. One of the Masters was\ncaptured there in Ferrok-Shahn. They tortured him as they did the one\non Earth. But he did not die unyielding. He spoke and told our plans!\"\n\n\"Hah! Did I not advise you to keep those helpless things on Wandl?\"\n\n\"But it is done now. The worlds know our purpose. They are preparing\nspaceships. Already some are rising from Ferrok-Shahn, from Grebhar\nand from Greater New York.\"\n\n\"We knew they were doing that.\"\n\n\"But now they know our purpose. The Master Intelligence fears that\nthey will come raiding Wandl. Our vessels are being made ready to go\nout and repel them.\"\n\nThe hollow voice ceased.\n\n\"Your purpose discovered?\" asked Anita. \"What does that mean? Won't\nyou tell us now? Twin queens for your future Mars, and you treat us\nlike children!\"\n\n\"That light-beam he so cleverly planted in Greater New York,\" Venza\nhinted.\n\n\"Yes, I will tell you. Without me in New York and my men who went with\nthese Wandlites to Ferrok-Shahn and Grebhar, the vital gravity beams\ncould never successfully have been planted. The apparatus was\ncomplicated; you saw it. You saw the labor I had making the contact?\"\n\n\"But what are the light-beams for?\"\n\nI listened, breathless, as he told them. The electronic beams could\nnot be destroyed; a disintegration of the rock atoms had been set up.\nWith each rotation of the Earth it was sweeping the sky. From a great\ncontrol station, Wandl was flinging attraction gravity upon that beam,\nusing it as a monstrous lever upon the rotation of Earth. With every\ndaily passage now the force was being exerted. The rotation was\nslowing. In a few days it would stop, with the end of the beam drawn\nto Wandl and held there.\n\nAnd the beams from Grebhar and Ferrok-Shahn were the same. Three giant\nchains! Then Wandl, traveling of its own gravitational volition, would\nwithdraw from our solar system. The gravitational chains would pull\nthe Earth, Venus and Mars after it!\n\nTitanic tow-ropes! The destruction, not of our worlds, but of all life\nupon them, for the cold of interstellar space would leave no living\norganism. Three dead worlds; Wandl would draw them to her own Sun and\nthen free them, send them, with new orbits, around the distant blazing\nstar. Three new worlds brought home triumphantly by Wandl to join the\nlittle family of inhabited planets revolving around this other Sun.\nThree fair and lovely worlds, warmed back by the other sunlight to be\ngreen mansions untenanted, ready to receive the new beings who would\ncome and possess them.\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n\"You, Snap!\"\n\n\"Gregg! But how...?\"\n\n\"Hush! They might hear us.\"\n\n\"They can do more than that. They can almost hear you think.\"\n\n\"Anita and Venza are here.\"\n\n\"I know it. I was with them for a time. This accursed gravity! I can't\nwalk.\"\n\n\"Careful,\" I whispered. \"You can crack your head on something with the\nleast false step. Are they taking us ashore?\"\n\n\"I guess so. How did you happen...?\"\n\n\"Tell you later.\"\n\nThey had come for me in that dark pressure-port, taken me along a dim\ncorridor of the ship, which evidently had landed a few moments before.\nThen Snap, with strange figures around him, had been flung at me.\n\nThese weird beings! The brains were here, but not many; I saw half a\ndozen on the ship. They could move easily now. They bounced upon their\nsmall arms and legs, hitching with little leaps of a few feet. Close\nat hand they were gruesome; from a distance they had the aspect of\nthirty-inch ovoids, bouncing of their own volition. And I saw too that\nunderneath, toward the back, was a shriveled body.\n\nThe other figures were wholly different; they seemed at first to be\nten-foot, upright insects. The two legs were like stilts, the body\nnarrow but with bulging chest. The neck was thin, holding the small\nround head, about the size of my own.\n\nWords seem futile to picture this thing which was a man of Wandl.\nThere was no skin, but instead what seemed to be a glossy, hard brown\nshell. It was laid in scales; and upon the legs was a brown fuzz of\nstiff hair. There were many joints, both of the legs and the torso.\nClothing was worn; a single garment, hanging from a wide belt halfway\ndown the legs seemed incongruous, fantastically aping humanity.\n\nThis was the worker, equipped by nature for mechanical tasks. There\nwere not two arms, but at least ten. From what could have been called\nthe shoulders, they were tentacles, half the length of an elephant's\ntrunk, with many-fingered hands at the ends. From the waist depended\nhuge lobster-like pincers; and from the chest and back the arms were\nsmaller, each with a different type finger-claw.\n\nThe head and face were most of all a personal mocking of mankind.\nWide, upstanding, listening ears were upon the sides of the head, one\non the forehead and one on the back. The face was mobile, with tiny\nbrown scales small as a fish. A nose orifice, with two protruding\nbrown eyes above it was set outward on stems, and an upended slit of a\nmouth. There was an eye in the back of the head.\n\nProbably, over eons of upward development from what was perhaps an\noriginal single type, these two specialized forms had developed. The\n\"Masters,\" as they were known upon Wandl, neglected the body for the\nbrain, and the \"Workers,\" the reverse. There was no separate\nindividual for the female. As is the case with primitive organisms,\nthey were all bi-sexual, the parent dying in the reproduction of\noffspring.\n\nOf necessity I have been forced into digression. But at the time, Snap\nand I clung together, whispering, as a group of workers pushed us down\na descending incline. Snap, back there in Greater New York when Molo's\ncontact light had burst into existence, had fallen, half unconscious.\nThey picked him up. Molo was going to kill him, but the girls\npersuaded him to take Snap with them.\n\n\"Anita and Venza pretended never to have seen me before,\" Snap\nwhispered to me now. \"You take the same line.\"\n\n\"If we get with them.\"\n\n\"We will.\"\n\nIt was weird, this landing upon Wandl. We had left the vessel's\nside-port and were descending what seemed a narrow, hundred-foot\nlanding incline. We were outdoors, and it was night. Shafts of colored\nradiance flashed around us. The ship was poised on a disc-like\nplatform, with skeleton legs. It seemed a hundred feet or more down to\nthe ground level from where the colored lights were darting up.\nOverhead was a cloudless, purple-red sky of blurred, reddish stars. No\ndoubt the curious atmosphere of Wandl gave the sky and stars this\nabnormal look.\n\nLater, what a multiplicity of obscure wonders we were to glimpse upon\nWandl! The slowing rotation of the Earth caused climatic changes\nthere, volcanic and tidal disturbances, but Wandl rotated and stopped\nat will. Undoubtedly she was equipped to withstand the shock. Her\ninternal fires could not break into eruption; she had very little\nfluid surface. And the nature of her atmosphere was such that it was\nnot easily disturbed into storms. Only if there was laxity in the\nhandling of the planet's motion would a storm come.\n\nBut now, questions pounded at me. Earth, Venus and Mars were to be\ntowed into interstellar space; all life on our worlds would perish in\nthe cold of that stellar journey. Yet Wandl had made that journey. Was\nher atmosphere inherently such that it did not transmit rays of heat?\n\nSnap and I had been pushed down the incline with half a dozen figures\nin advance of us. Without difficulty we could have leapt down that\nhundred feet, unaided. Figures were leaping into mid-air from several\npressure-ports of the ship. They did not fall, but floated, drifted\ndown. I saw one of the insect-like workers drop with motionless\noutstretched arms. Others came mounting up, using their arms and legs\nwith sweeping strokes, as though swimming. It was like being under\nwater.\n\nIt was a strange, weird scene, the vessel wavering above us; the\nflashing lights; waving beams of radiance. A fantastic structure\nnearby reared itself several hundred feet with lights on top and\noutlining its many lateral balconies one above the other. The air was\nfull of the leaping, swimming insect-like figures. The brains, the\nmasters, were not in evidence; then I saw one of them being carried,\nand others, floating down like distended falling balloons, to be\ncaught by the workers in small nets and thus saved from jarring\ncontact.\n\nSnap was suddenly whispering: \"That fellow back of us is our guard. I\ncan feel his ray. Some form of attraction; it's pulling at me.\"\n\nSnap was a little behind me. I turned and saw the faint radiance of a\nnarrow light-beam upon him. It came from an instrument in an upper\nshoulder hand of the insect figure following us, no doubt the reverse\nform of the same ray which had been used to thrust the wrecked\n_Cometara_ toward the Moon.\n\nWe reached the bottom. I saw now that the group of workers in advance\nof us were carrying metal cubes, seemingly of considerable weight;\nthey also had to use the incline.\n\nWe stood presently on a smooth ground surface. We had not seen Anita\nand Venza, nor Molo and his sister. The insect figure who was our\nguard came forward. \"You stand here. Molo comes.\"\n\n\"Where is he?\" I demanded. \"I want to see him.\" I stopped myself\nquickly; I had very nearly mentioned the girls. \"And talk with him.\"\n\n\"He comes soon.\"\n\n\"I'm hungry.\" I gestured to my stomach. \"Food. You know what that is?\"\n\nThe brown scaly face contorted for a smile, a ghastly grimace. \"Yes.\nYou shall have food and drink.\"\n\nIt seemed that the hollow voice came not from the neck but from the\nshell-like, bulging chest. He stood aside, with the globular weapon of\nthe ray in a pincer hand.\n\nWe waited, standing gingerly together, wavering with our slight\nweight. A wind would have blown us away, but there was no wind.\nInstead, there was a heavy, sultry air, warm as a mid-summer Earth\nnight, warmer even than the Neo-time of Venus.\n\nSnap and I were dressed much the same, wearing heavy boots, for which\nweight we were thankful, tight, puttee-like trousers, flaring at the\ntop, and high-necked white blouses. Both of us were bare-headed.\nDoubtless we were as fantastic a sight to these Wandlites as they to\nus. Some of the workers crowded up, reaching out to pluck at us, but\nSnap waved them away and our guard dispersed them.\n\nOne of the master brains came bouncing up. Upon his little upright\nbody the great head wavered.\n\n\"You will wait here.\" His eyes glowed up at us.\n\n\"But listen,\" Snap began.\n\n\"You will wait here for the Martian. He has his orders to take you to\nthe Great Intelligence.\" The little arm from the side of the head had\na hand with a finger pointing for a gesture. \"There is a meeting place\nthere. We decided now what to do to destroy the warships of your\nworlds. I do not like your thoughts; they are black. I will inform the\nGreat Intelligence when he can spare the thought for you.\"\n\nHe added something in the Wandl tongue. A worker came forward; lifted\nhim carefully, held him in the hollow of an encircling tentacle. And\nwith a bound, the worker sailed upward and was gone.\n\nAgain we stood through an interval. I noticed now that the towering\nstructure near us, with its storied balconies, was not perpendicular.\nIts front curved up and back. It was convex, somewhat in the fashion\nof an irregular globe, a three-hundred foot ball, with a flattened\nbase set here on the ground. The balconies were segments of its front\ncurve. At the top, the roof was as though the ball had been sliced\noff, like a giant apple with a slice gone for a base and another for\nthe roof. At the bottom was a huge portal with a glow of light from\nwithin. And at the terraced balcony levels were lighted windows.\n\n\"Is that the meeting place?\" Snap whispered.\n\n\"Probably. And look to the side of it, Snap.\"\n\nIt was a city. There was a vista of distance to one side of the great\nglobe structure. Now that our eyes were more accustomed to the\nqueerness of this night upon Wandl, we could ignore the colored\nlight-beams of the landing stage and the disembarking palisade upon\nwhich we were standing. Gazing into the distance, the curvature of the\nsurface of this little world was immediately apparent. The reddish\nfirmament of stars came down to meet the sharply-curving surface at a\nhorizon line which seemed about a mile away.\n\nSpread upon this near distance were a variety of structures with\nlittle roads of open space winding between them. Most of the buildings\nseemed globular in shape. Some were small, little round mound-shaped\nindividual dwellings. Others were larger. Some were tiered like half a\ndozen apples speared in a row upon a stick and set upright.\n\nI saw a ribbon of what might be a river in the distance, with the\nreddish starlight glinting upon it. To our left, half a mile away\nperhaps, was a row of buttes and rocks which stood like a miniature\nrange of mountains. The city seemed entirely to encompass them; and\nevery little rock-peak had upon its top a globelike dwelling.\n\nLights were winking everywhere and figures bounded a hundred feet and\nmore, and sailed in an arc, coming down to the ground to bound again.\nA row of workers went by overhead, not swimming or leaping but stiffly\nmotionless. Tiny opalescent rays went from them to the ground, as\nthough to give them power.\n\nFive minutes of Earth-time might have passed while Snap and I gazed at\nthis busy night scene in this Wandl city upon the occasion of the\nlanding of their ship so triumphantly returned from its mission to\nEarth. As I stood, certainly a helpless captive if ever there was one,\nnevertheless a strange sense of my own power was within me.\n\nThis was so small a world; the people were so flimsy. With a poke of\nmy fist I could kill any one of these master brains. The ten-foot\nworkers seemed mere shells, light and fragile; even the buildings were\nlight and flimsy. The little globe-houses on their sticks seemed to\nwaver, almost like nodding flowers. If we ran amuck we could smash\neverything we saw here on Wandl.\n\nWe became aware of Molo approaching. What a solid giant this\nseven-foot Martian seemed now in the midst of this buoyant, almost\nweightless city! He was still bare-headed and wearing his garments of\nornamented leather, with his brawny legs bare. Upon his feet were\nstrange-looking, wide-soled shoes. His hands and forearms were thrust\ninto loops of small shields. These shields appeared to be constructed\nof a heart-shaped flexible framework, covered with an opaque membrane.\nThey were about two feet long and half as wide. With a hand and\nforearm thrust into fabric loops, the shield appeared to serve as\nwings so that the arms had more thrust against the air. He came at us\nwith a sort of swimming stroke. He landed somewhat awkwardly,\nhalf-stumbled and almost fell, but gathered himself up and confronted\nus.\n\nHe gained his balance and waved our guard aside. His gaze went to me.\n\n\"You are the new prisoner taken from that wrecked Earth-ship?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"What is your name? You are an Earthman, evidently.\"\n\n\"Yes.\" I hesitated. I had seen Molo and heard him talk, back there in\nGreater New York; but he had not seen me nor heard of me probably.\n\n\"Gregg Haljan.\" I added, \"I am a skilled navigator; perhaps it was\nfortunate you saved me.\"\n\nHe flung me a look and there was a tinge of amusement in it. \"You\nwould save your own skin now?\"\n\n\"Why not? You're a Martian, and this is a war also against Mars.\"\n\nHis look darkened, but then again sardonic amusement struck him.\n\n\"We shall see what the Great Master says. There will be a few of our\ntype humans, men and women, wanted when the worlds begin anew. The\nGreat Master said so. He wants to study life on Earth as it was before\nthe destruction.\"\n\nMolo's glance swept behind us. I turned to see three figures\napproaching. My heart pounded. They were Anita, Venza and Molo's\nsister, Meka. They came slowly, trying to walk, with balancing\noutstretched arms. With a dozen curious Wandl workers crowding them,\nthey came and joined Molo before us. My heart was pounding, but I\nflung them a curious, impersonal stare.\n\n\"You are here,\" said Molo. \"Good. We go now.\" He bent over Snap and\nme. \"I advise you make no effort to leap away, though it may look\neasy.\"\n\n\"Not me,\" said Snap. \"Where would I go alone in this damned world? I\ncan't very well leap back to Earth, can I?\"\n\n\"True enough,\" said Molo. \"You have sense, little fellow. But I just\nwarn you: the guard who will watch you always is very sharp of eye.\nAnd the weapons here bring very swift death.\"\n\nI could feel Anita's gaze upon me, but I did not dare look her way.\n\n\"Let's go,\" I said, \"You will have no trouble with me.\"\n\nWith Molo leading us, and the giant insect-like guard following close\nbehind, we made our slow, awkward way across the esplanade portals of\nthe huge globular building.\n\nAnd within, we traversed a cylinder-like, padded corridor and came\npresently upon the strangest interior scene I had ever beheld.\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nThe room was so large that it seemed almost the entire interior of the\nbuilding. It was a globular room, a hundred and fifty feet or more in\ndiameter. The inner surface was crowded with people. It was a huge,\nhollow interior of a ball; and upon its concave surface a throng of\nthe brown-shelled workers were gathered. They sat on low seats at the\ncurved bottom of the room, where we entered, and up the sides and upon\nthe slopes and the top, like flies in a globe, hanging head downward.\nThere was no up or down here; the slight gravity made little\ndifference.\n\nI gazed up amazed to where, a hundred and fifty feet above me, head\ndownward, the crowd of figures were calmly seated. These were\nclinging, of course; the pound-weight of each of them would drop them\ndown if they let loose. But it required only a slight effort.\n\nBetween the tiers, there were narrow open aisles bearing glowlights at\nintervals. With Molo leading us, we stared up the curving incline of\none of these aisles.\n\n\"Gregg! Good Lord, it's weird!\" Snap said. \"Where are we going to sit?\nDon't speak to the girls yet.\"\n\n\"Have you spoken to them?\"\n\n\"Yes. A little, on the ship. They're watching for an opportunity but\nwe have to be cautious. Gregg, I've got so much to tell you, but no\nchance. The brains can just about hear your thoughts.\"\n\nWe went only a short distance up the incline. There were vacant seats\nseemingly held ready for us. Our passage created a commotion among the\nfigures. Some leaped up and over us to get a better look. I found that\nwe were clinging to the mound-like convex surface of a small\nhalf-globe. It raised us some ten feet above the floor. There were low\nseats with arms against the side-pull of gravity. I found Anita close\nbeside me. Her hand touched me, but she did not turn her head or\nspeak.\n\nMolo was on my other side. I chanced to see his feet. They were\nplanted firmly on the floor. He wore wide-soled shoes equipped with\nsuction pads, no doubt, which would enable him, like the Wandlites,\nto walk and stand upon the upper inner surfaces of buildings.\n\nAs during the moments when Snap and I stood on the landing esplanade,\nthere was so much here that at first I could not encompass it. But now\nI began to grasp other details of the strange scene.\n\nPoised in mid-air, almost exactly in the center of the huge globular\nroom, was a metal globe of some thirty feet in diameter. It was held,\nnot by any solid girders, but by four narrow beams of light which\nmounted to it from widespread points of the convex room.\n\nUpon the entire surface of this thirty-foot globe, a group of masters\nwere seated, in little, cup-like seats upon resilient stems. They\nswayed and nodded with movement. There seemed to be glowing wires and\ngrids and thread-like beams of light carrying current. Light-threads\nshot from the mechanisms to the heads of the seated brains. All the\ndevices were evidently in operation; and upon this poised central\nglobe the attention of the audience was directed.\n\nMolo bent over me. \"The Great Intelligence soon will see you.\"\n\nSnap, from the other side of Molo, whispered: \"What are they doing up\nthere?\"\n\nThe faint hiss and throb of the devices were audible. I stared, trying\nto understand. Images, and sounds, invisible and inaudible were being\nreceived from across the millions of miles of space, and they were\nbeing transmuted within the brains themselves. I saw that discs were\nfastened upon the bulging foreheads of the brains, upon which the tiny\nlight-beams carrying the vibrations impinged.\n\nThese brains, receiving \"waves\" of some unknown variety were, within\nthe mechanism of the brain-cell, transmuting, translating the\nvibrations into things knowable. They were not seeing, not hearing,\nbut _knowing_ what went on millions of miles across space!\n\nAgain Molo bent over me. \"They are about to show this audience what is\nhappening on the three worlds.\"\n\nUpon the thirty-foot globe I saw now a dozen or so balls of about\nthree-foot diameter. These had been dark and I had not noticed them.\nNow they began glowing, not from wires carrying the current, but from\nthe little hands of the brains touching them.\n\nI stared at the brain nearest me. His flabby little arm was extended;\nhis hand touched the image-ball; gave it light and color, like a\nfortune-teller of Earth with a crystal before her.\n\nEven though I was some sixty feet from it, I could see the moving\nimages clearly, and recognized the scene. The Tappan Interplanetary\nStage. Ships were rising; two of our spaceships mounting.\n\nAnd all in an instant the scene blurred, took form again. The\nred-green spires and minarets of Ferrok-Shahn. The Central Canal\nextended like a gash across the foreground; the \"Mushroom Mountains\"\nwere in a line upon the horizon. Three Martian space-flyers slid up\nwhile we watched.\n\nAnd now Grebhar. The silver forest in all its shining beauty, where\nVenza was born. The sunlight sparkled on the river. A spaceship was\nrising in the distant sky over the shining forest.\n\nBeyond Anita, I heard Venza murmuring, \"Home! If only we were there.\"\n\nI could feel Anita move to silence her.\n\nMolo was whispering: \"They come. But we will be ready for them.\"\n\nAnother image: mid-space. The allied ships gathering, waiting for\nothers to arrive. A group here of about ten of our ships from the\nthree worlds: poised, waiting.\n\nI was aware that upon the mound-like protuberance of the room-floor\nwhere we were sitting, a door was opening. It slid, or melted away. At\nour feet was an opening downward into the small interior of the mound.\n\nMolo whispered, \"The great Master. Sit quiet! He will talk to us.\"\n\nOver us now a barrage came with a hiss, a circular curtain of\ninsulation. The huge globular room faded. We were alone on the mound,\nSnap, Molo, myself, Anita, Venza and Meka upon the end of our bench.\nBehind us stood our single Wandlite guard, with a weapon in his\nshoulder hand.\n\nAt our feet an opening yawned into the mound-interior. It was a tiny,\nlighted room. In a cup-like seat a brain was perched, just below the\nlevel of our feet: the great Master Brain of Wandl. He was alone here.\nNot attended by retinue; no pomp and ceremony to usher us into his\npresence; no underlings obsequiously bowing to mark him for a great\nruler.\n\nWe stared down, and the great brain stared up at us, seemingly equally\ncurious. His head was a full four feet in diameter; the little body\nsat in the cup, with dangling legs. The clothes were ornamented: there\nwas a glowing device on the chest.\n\nHe spoke with a measured rumble, in Martian. \"You are Molo, of\nFerrok-Shahn.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Molo.\n\n\"You must say, 'Yes, Great Master.'\"\n\n\"Yes, Great Master.\"\n\n\"I know about you. I know that we trust you.\"\n\nThe huge round eyes next fastened upon me. Then to Snap, and back to\nme. The words were English this time. \"Men of Earth, are you decided,\nlike the Martian, to join with us?\"\n\nI tried with sudden vehemence to still my thoughts, or to change them\nso that they lied. Fear surged upon me. Could this vast mechanism of\nhuman mind here at my feet interpret the vibrations of my thoughts?\nCould this Great Master of Wandl see into my mind?\n\nThe brain said, \"You are uncertain. You do not want to die?\"\n\n\"No Great Master,\" we both answered.\n\n\"You shall not, unless you attempt to cause us trouble. Your thoughts\nare black.\" He addressed Molo. \"Have they ever been read?\"\n\n\"No, Great Master.\"\n\n\"When opportunity comes, have them read.\" He added to Snap and me: \"I\nplan to take prisoners. My Supreme Rulers, rulers of a neighboring\nmore powerful planet, which sent Wandl upon her mission of conquest,\nordered it. When your worlds are vacant of life, those who command me\nwill want some of you left alive to be studied. Your thoughts are very\nblack, Earthman. I think when they are carefully read you will prove\nno great advantage to us.\"\n\nThere was irony in the voice, and upon the monstrous bulging face came\nthe horrible travesty of a grin.\n\nThe grin on the brain's face faded. His interest went again to Molo.\n\"That is your sister.\" The eyes swung to Meka and back.\n\n\"Yes, Great Master.\"\n\n\"She is caring for this Earth-girl and this girl from Venus?\"\n\n\"Yes, Great Master. I am fond of them. I have plans.\"\n\n\"They are in your charge, Martian; I will not interfere with you. But\nguard them well. I trust you and your sister. These others....\"\n\n\"The Earth and the Venus girl can be of help to me, Great Master.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"They knew young men who were in the Spaceship Service. They can tell\nme the armament of men and weapons on most of the spaceships which\nEarth will send against us.\"\n\nDid Molo really believe that? Probably not, but he wanted the girls\nwith him. Again came that grotesque smile. \"Let them not bother you,\nMartian. You have work to do. Listen carefully. There will be a\nbattle. Earth, Mars, and Venus may perhaps have a hundred ships. I\ncannot bring destruction upon those three worlds in a day. We soon\nwill make contact with the light-beam you placed on Earth. That I will\nshow you. But the rotation cannot be stopped at once. It will take\ntime.\n\n\"The enemy ships might dare to come to Wandl, but I shall not wait for\nthat. All my spaceships are very nearly ready. If there is to be a\nbattle, it shall be far from here, in the neighborhood of the enemy\nworlds. We are at this time about sixty-two million of your miles from\nthe Earth, a third less than that from Mars, and about a third more\nfrom Venus. I understand, Martian, that you are skilled in space\nwarfare.\"\n\nThe brain went on, \"I have given you a vessel to command. You will be\nsurprised to know its name: the _Star-Streak_.\"\n\nMeka gasped, \"But you destroyed it, Great Master!\"\n\n\"Only wrecked it, Martian girl. It is repaired now. You, Molo--and\nyour sister to help you--who could command it to more advantage? All\nyour own weapons, and ours of Wandl have been added. You may select\nyour crew. Is it to your liking?\"\n\n\"Yes, Great Master.\"\n\n\"You will be housed in this city, Wor, in the dwelling-globe you\noccupied before. Keep your prisoners with you, if you like.\"\n\n\"These two Earthmen....\" began Molo, but he was interrupted.\n\n\"Settle that later. I do not want the annoyance.\"\n\nI was dimly conscious of a great clanging, coming through the curtain\nof barrage which was over us.\n\nThe brain added, \"Keep Wyk with you, to guard the prisoners; he will\nalso attend your needs. In the battle, Martian, I expect great things\nof you and your _Star-Streak_.\"\n\n\"Great Master, you will not be disappointed.\"\n\n\"And prisoners, but not too many. Bring me a few young specimens like\nthese, representative of Venus, Mars and the Earth. I want both of the\nsexes, an equal number of each.\"\n\n\"Yes, Great Master.\"\n\n\"The warning signal is coming. You will now see our first contact.\"\n\nThe light at our feet was fading. It clung last by the gruesome face\nof the huge brain; the goggling eyes shone green, and as the light in\nthe little mound-room dimmed there was in a moment nothing left but\nthose lurid green pools of the brain's eyes.\n\nThen I was aware that the aperture at our feet had closed. Over us,\nthe barrage curtain was dissipating, sight and sound coming in to us.\nThe huge ball-shaped conclave room again became visible, the audience\ncrowding its entire inner surface.\n\nI suddenly felt Anita's fingers twitching at my sleeve.\n\n\"Gregg, darling, can you hear me?\"\n\n\"Yes. Be careful.\"\n\nBut Molo was gazing up over our heads. The crowd was shifting, bending\nso that they all seemed gazing at their feet. A dim white radiance,\nseeming to come from down here somewhere near us, lay in a splotch on\na segment of the throng overhead. Molo was watching.\n\nI whispered, \"All right, Anita. Quick, what is it?\"\n\n\"The great control station is not far from here. Venza and I have been\ntrying to find out where it is exactly.\"\n\nShe stopped, evidently fearful of Meka. Then she added:\n\n\"Gregg, we haven't been guarded very closely; they're not suspicious\nof us.\"\n\n\"Later, Anita. Can't talk now.\"\n\n\"No. Watch our chance. Later.\"\n\nI turned toward Molo. \"What's that up there?\"\n\n\"The transparent ray is opening the top of the globe.\"\n\nThe clanging signal gong had stilled. The audience was hushed and\nexpectant. The white patch of light overhead spread until it\nencompassed all the top of the globe. The whole area was glowing. The\npeople were white, spectral shapes, transparent! And the top of the\nglobe was transparent; I saw the night sky, with the gleaming reddish\nstars.\n\nIt was, in a moment, as though we were staring up at a huge square\nwindow orifice cut in the top of the room. A broad vista of cloudless\nsky and stars was visible. Across it, like a shining sword, was a\nnarrow, opalescent beam.\n\n\"The Earth-beam which I planted,\" Molo whispered triumphantly. \"Our\ncontrol station will contact with it now. The first contact!\"\n\nEarth was below our angle of vision, but the beam from Greater New\nYork, sweeping the sky with the Earth's rotation, was passing now\ncomparatively close to Wandl.\n\nThere was an expectant moment. Then into the sky leaped another ray,\nnarrow, luridly green. It swung up from Wandl and darted into space.\nThe hissing, agonized electrical scream from it as it burst through\nthe Wandl atmosphere was deafening. I saw it strike the Earth-beam,\ngrip it with a blinding burst of radiance up there in the sky,\nclinging, pulling against the rotation of the Earth with a lever sixty\nmillion miles long.\n\nA moment of screaming sound in the atmosphere around us, and that\nconflict of light in the sky. Then the screaming suddenly stilled. The\nWandl beam vanished.\n\nThe Earth-beam still swept the heavens like a stiff, upstanding sword.\nBut in that moment when Wandl gripped it, the axis of the Earth had\nbeen changed a little. The rotation was slowed. By a few minutes, the\nday and the night on Earth were lengthened.\n\nIt was the beginning of Earth's desolation.\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n\"But when do we eat?\" Snap demanded.\n\n\"Soon,\" said Molo.\n\n\"I hope so.\"\n\nWe were leaving the great room as we had come. Walking? I can only\ncall it that, though the word is futile to describe our progress as we\nmade our way to the lighted esplanade, across its side and into what\nmight have been called a street. Globular houses, single, or one set\nupon another, or half a dozen swaying on a stick, gardens of\nvegetables and flowers. I saw what seemed to be a round patch of\nhundred-foot tree-stalks, like a thick batch of bamboo. It was laced\nand latticed thick with vines.\n\n\"A house,\" Snap murmured. \"That's a house.\"\n\nAnother type of dwelling. This patch of vegetable growth, so flimsy it\nwas all stirring with the movement of the night breeze, was woven into\ncircular thatched rooms, birds' nests of little dwellings. Staring up,\nI seemed to see a hundred of them. Rope-vine ladders; flimsy vine\nplatforms; tiny lights winking up there in the trees.\n\nOn a platform twenty feet above us a group of tiny infant brains sat\nin a gruesome row, goggling down on us.\n\nWe passed the tree patch; again the city seemed all a thin, flexible\nmetal. The ground was like a smooth rock surface, alternating with\nsmall patches of soil where things were growing.\n\nWe walked in a slow, unsteady line. Molo led. Behind Snap and me came\nthe girls, ignoring us; and at the rear, the brown-shelled giant guard\nstalked after us.\n\nMolo stopped at a large globe-dwelling. \"We rest here. I will go see\nthat our rooms are ready.\" He gestured to his sister. \"Meka, you come\nwith me. Wyk will guard them.\"\n\nWe stood at an oval doorway. A worker came out, stared at us, then\nwent back. On an upper balcony, a brain was gazing down at us.\n\nI caught Molo's brawny arm. \"Won't you tell us what's going on?\"\n\n\"Rest here with Wyk.\"\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" asked Snap.\n\n\"I am going to select my men for battle.\"\n\n\"When do you go?\"\n\n\"In a few hours, Earth-time.\"\n\n\"And you're taking us on the ship, Molo? Where is your _Star-Streak_?\"\n\n\"That I must find out.\" He, gazed at us with a slow, faint smile. \"Not\nfar. Nothing is far on Wandl. I do not know if I will take you on my\nship. You might be of help, or you might be troublesome. The Great\nMaster wants prisoners, or I would have killed you long ago.\"\n\nHe took his sister and left us. There was a brief moment when Wyk,\nstanding aside incuriously, gave us opportunity for swift whispers.\n\nAgain Anita clutched me. \"Gregg, we'll be separated now. But with Molo\ngone, Venza and I can get away from Meka.\"\n\nVenza whirled on us. \"Gregg, listen! Snap, be quiet! If we're ever\ngoing to escape, now is the time. You get away from Wyk. We'll handle\nMeka.\"\n\n\"And do what?\" Snap demanded.\n\n\"The control station! We'll find it!\"\n\nAnita whispered, \"We've got to wreck it, Gregg. Stop those contacts.\nIt'll mean the end of Earth if we don't.\"\n\nI protested. \"Better try for Molo's vessel. We might be able to\nnavigate it, escape from this world.\"\n\n\"The control station first,\" Anita insisted. \"Gregg, we know something\nabout it. You and Snap, with your strength, can demolish it. And then,\nif we can locate the _Star-Streak_....\"\n\nIt was a desperate, mad plan, but there seemed nothing better. The\ngirls insisted now that though they did not know where the control\nstation was located, they knew the details of its interior; its\nphysical layout; its human operators.\n\n\"In an hour,\" whispered Snap. \"Have you got a timer? Is it going?\"\n\nThe little timers we still had with us were undoubtedly operating\ndifferently from on Earth; but they were in agreement.\n\n\"An hour by our timers,\" I whispered. \"We'll make the break then, try\nto find you inside. Anita, if you get free of Meka, don't come out.\"\n\n\"All right.\"\n\nWe had only a moment to try and plan it. \"Anita, in an hour, with Molo\ngone....\"\n\nHe came suddenly with a driving leap from the doorway and dropped\namong us. \"All is ready. Come.\"\n\nWe ignored the girls. Snap again protested that he was hungry, which\nindeed, for me at least, was certainly the truth. And I was parched\nwith thirst. I felt that this vaunted strength of my Earth body would\nnot last long without food and drink.\n\nWe entered the globular interior. There were narrow corridors;\ntriangular rooms; a slatted, ladder-like incline leading upward to a\nhigher level.\n\nThe girls followed Meka up the incline. Molo and Wyk herded us into a\nnearby room. \"You will have your food and drink here. Cause Wyk no\ntrouble and you will be quite safe.\"\n\nHe turned, but Snap plucked at him. \"When are you coming back?\"\n\n\"Not too long.\"\n\nI said, \"We will cause you no trouble. Take us on the ship.\"\n\n\"I will see.\"\n\nHe murmured to Wyk in Martian, then left us.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe small triangular room had no windows and only the single door. Wyk\ntouched a mechanism and it slid closed. The place was a queer\napartment indeed. The floor was convex, curving upward to the walls.\nThe light radiance dimly glowed, as though inherent to the metal\nceiling. There was strange metal furniture: a table and chairs, high\nand large; bunks of a size evidently for the ten-foot workers.\n\nThe door opened, and a worker brought us food and drink. Wyk sat apart\nand watched us while we consumed the meal. I noticed that he seldom\nlet himself get close to us. He sat stiffly upright, with his jointed\nlegs bent double under him, his many arms and pincers hanging inert,\nsave the one short shoulder-arm with flexible fingers gripping his\nweapon. At his waist, and upon several hook-like protuberances of his\nchest, other weapons and devices were hanging.\n\nSnap gazed up from where, on the floor, we were ravenously eating and\ndrinking. \"Aren't you hungry?\" he asked Wyk.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"You eat often?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nAn incurious, taciturn creature, this insect-like being. Snap\nwhispered, \"Got to talk to him; make him let us get close. That\nweapon....\"\n\nHow the weapon operated, we did not know; but that a flash from it\nwould bring instant death we well imagined.\n\nHalf of that hour of waiting was past.\n\nI said to Wyk, \"You would call this night on your world; the sun\nobviously is on the other hemisphere. When will it be day?\"\n\nHis gaze swung on me. His hollow voice, deep from the capacious shell\nof chest, echoed and blurred in the room.\n\n\"I think Wandl has no rotation now. Or almost none.\"\n\nHe was not as taciturn, as he had seemed, and presently we had him\ntalking. We learned several things regarding the gravity-controls of\nWandl, by which at will the planet could be rotated on its axis; and\nby which also it could navigate space. We learned that the great\ncontrol station contained these gravitational mechanisms, as well as\nthe mechanism by which the Earth had been attacked. But we could not\ndiscover where on Wandl that station was located.\n\nThen, with our meal finished, Snap rose to his feet. \"Those arms of\nyours, seem very strange to us. But they must be mighty useful.\"\n\nSnap had taken a cautious, shoving step. It wafted him directly toward\nthe guard.\n\nThe weird, brown-scaled face of Wyk, with its popping eyes upon stems\nand its upended mouth, contorted with surprise.\n\n\"Back! Don't come near me!\"\n\nHe flung himself back, but struck the wall of the room. All his arms\nwere writhing. Alarm was in his voice. It was the first time either\nSnap or I had made an unexpected move, and it startled Wyk.\n\n\"Wait! Let me go!\" Snap cried.\n\nWyk's longest arms were around Snap, like the tentacles of an octopus,\nand Snap was struggling, fighting. We had not intended this at this\ntime, but the opportunity was here.\n\nI scrambled from the floor. Now, with the need for powerful action,\nthe lack of gravity was a tremendous handicap. I went up with\nflailing arms into the air. Wyk fired his weapon, but it missed me, a\nsoundless, dimly-white bolt. It hissed along the curving wall of the\nroom. The smell of it was a stench in my nostrils.\n\nI hit the concave ceiling, shoved down, and like a swimmer in water\nstruck against the struggling bodies of Snap and the guard. The waving\nlittle shoulder arm with the weapon came at me.\n\nSnap shouted, \"Gregg, look out!\"\n\nI seized the little arm; it felt like the shell of a huge crab. For a\nmoment we were all three entangled, floundering, unable to find a\nfoothold. Then suddenly I felt Snap pulling me loose.\n\n\"We've got him!\"\n\nThe brown-shelled body of Wyk sank away from us, hit the floor and lay\nstill. I felt the floor under me, and Snap clutching at me.\n\nIn my hand I was clutching Wyk's little shoulder arm, with fingers\nstill gripping the weapon. I had jerked it out of his shoulder socket.\nWith a shudder I cast the noisome thing away. Whether Wyk was dead or\nnot we did not know. He lay on his back; the hideous face stared\nupward.\n\n\"I cracked the shell,\" Snap gasped. \"We've got to get out of here.\nBetter try and get the girls loose now.\"\n\nWe wasted no further time on Wyk. Snap snatched several of his weapons\nand mechanical devices. We stowed them hastily in our pockets. One was\nlike another to us; we could only guess at their uses.\n\n\"His shoes, Gregg. I can't get the damn things off him.\"\n\n\"Here are shoes.\"\n\nA small pile of shoes was in a corner of the room; wide, resilient\nsuction soles, built like sandals. They were very large, but the\nthings were so placed that it seemed we could fasten them to our\nboots.\n\n\"But not now, Snap.\"\n\nWe snatched up four pairs of the shoes.\n\nThere seemed nothing else to do. Could we get the door open? Snap was\nalready fumbling at it. \"Accursed thing! It won't give.\"\n\nThen it slid open. The dim corridor was visible. No one, nothing, out\nthere. \"Come on, Gregg! In a rush!\"\n\nWe went like bouncing rubber figures up the incline ladder.\n\n\"Snap, watch out!\" He all but cracked his head with an upward leap.\nEvery instant we expected to be set upon. There was a terraced upper\nhall, black with shadow; dark ovals of doorways led into rooms.\n\nNo one here. As yet we were not discovered.\n\nWe stood at the intersection of two corridors. One went almost\nvertically up, like a chimney extending into the dome peak of the\nglobe. Its sides were latticed; we could go up it hand over hand, like\nmonkeys. The other sloped at an angle downward.\n\n\"Which way?\" Snap whispered. \"What do you think? Got to find them.\"\n\nIt still lacked about five minutes of our designated time, but it\nwould not do to burst in upon the girls, perhaps to find Molo and\nguards there.\n\n\"Let's wait a minute, listen, see if we can't get some idea.\"\n\nWe were backed against the corridor wall, almost in darkness. From the\ndark length of the descending corridor came a thump, the sound of a\nstruggle, and then a muffled scream. Venza! And we heard her words:\n\"Anita! Look out for her! She's got a knife!\"\n\nAs though diving into water, Snap and I plunged head first into the\nblackness of the corridor.\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\nLater, we learned that Anita and Venza had tried much the same tactics\non Meka that we had used on Wyk, but their task was more difficult.\nShe was suspicious of them. Venza asked her where the control station\nwas, but she wouldn't answer.\n\n\"Your brother said it was just beyond the dark forest,\" Anita said.\n\"What is the dark forest?\"\n\n\"A place with trees where no one lives.\"\n\n\"Off that way.\" Venza gestured. \"That's what Molo said. Will it be day\nsoon, or will the night keep on?\"\n\n\"If they cause Wandl to rotate, it will soon be day.\" An ironic look\ncrossed Meka's face. \"I am in no mood for answering more of your silly\nquestions. Save the breath.\"\n\n\"Well, if that's they way you feel about it,\" replied Venza laughing,\n\"we will. There's not much air in here.\" She shoved herself across the\nfloor toward the closed window.\n\n\"Get back!\"\n\n\"Oh, all right--all right!\"\n\nPerhaps Meka herself felt there was not enough air. She stood\nwaveringly upright, and pushed herself with a slow leap for the\nwindow. Her back for that moment was to Anita and Venza. They shoved\nfrom the floor, whirled through the air and were upon her.\n\nIt was a brief struggle, and instantly they knew that they had lost.\nThe huge Martian whirled and flung them off. Her upflung fist, with a\nblow like a man's, caught Anita's thigh and knocked her toward the\nceiling. She sank in a heap on the floor, saw that Venza had shoved\nback, but was standing upright.\n\nAnita bent double, with her feet braced against a chair, tensed to\nshove forward again. At the still unopened window, Meka crouched.\nAnita heard Venza's warning outcry. \"Anita, look out for her! She's\ngot a knife!\"\n\nUpon this scene, in a moment, Snap and I came with a rush. The closed\ndoor was not barred. We slid it down and catapulted through the\nopening. Meka sailed over us. I swam up at her; seized her. The knife\nripped my blouse and slit the flesh of my upper arm with a glancing\nblow. Then Snap came and struck against us; we sank to the floor.\n\nMeka had fought silently, but now she was shouting. I twisted her\nwrist, seized the knife handle and flung the knife away. I was aware\nof Anita lunging to retrieve it. And over us Venza appeared, waving a\nmetal chair as though it were a huge feather.\n\nSnap gasped, \"Gregg get your hand over her mouth. Shut her up!\"\n\nWe had her subdued in a moment, but it seemed almost too late. Outside\nthe opened door a distant shout sounded.\n\nI shoved Meka toward the door. \"If you don't do what I say, I'll kill\nyou,\" I whispered into her ear.\n\n\"What shall I do?\"\n\nThere came another shout, closer, now. Someone was coming.\n\n\"Call out in Martian. Say there's no trouble, nothing wrong. You were\narguing with these girls.\"\n\nShe did as I commanded. The voice down the corridor answered, and then\nsubsided.\n\nSnap slid the door closed. \"Hurry! We'll go by the window. I dropped\nthose damn shoes.\"\n\nAnita and Venza tore their dark coats into strips. We bound and gagged\nMeka, laid her in a corner of the room. We had dropped the shoes as we\ncame plunging through the door oval. We found that we could all fasten\ntheir things to our feet. I put Meka's knife in my belt.\n\n\"Hurry, all of you!\" Snap was saying. \"Got to get out of here; jump by\nthe window.\"\n\n\"Say, look at these wing-shields!\" From a recess in a corner of the\nroom Venza appeared with an armful of the small shields. We thrust our\nhands and forearms into their loops. The shields extended from a few\ninches beyond our fingers to the elbow.\n\nSnap had slid the window blind. I bent over the prone form of Meka.\n\"Don't try to move. Molo will release you when he comes back.\"\n\nWe gathered on the starlit balcony. The city stretched around us.\nThere was as yet no alarm. No swimming figures near here; but a\ndistance away we saw the towering conclave globe, with its audience\njust beginning to emerge, like bees coming from a hive.\n\n\"Let me go first.\" I held Anita and Venza at the rail. \"It's like\nswimming. I suppose we'll get the way of it pretty quickly.\"\n\nI balanced on the rail, and then leaped off. With the others after me,\nwe swam awkwardly upward into the reddish starlight.\n\nThe city structures dropped away, showing in a dark blur with winking\nlights. Over us were the stars and the cloudless night sky. Behind,\nthe flashing light beams of radiance at the landing stage, the\nfigures fluttering, the great globe, all dropped swiftly beneath a\nsharply curving horizon.\n\nWe had passed the city. A thousand feet below us, a dark forest\nstretched. It was beyond this that the control station was located.\n\nThe swimming flight became less awkward, but it was an effort in this\nabnormal Wandl air. Snap and Venza were behind me. Anita was leading,\na strange, bird-like little figure. White blouse; long parted dark\nskirt from which her gray-sheathed legs kicked out as she swam,\nsometimes half upon one side, or with a breast stroke. The braids of\nher dark hair fell forward over her shoulders.\n\nShe was tiring: I could not miss it. How far had we gone? Ten miles,\nperhaps. There was only a small vista of this little world visible at\nonce, it was so sharply convex. A line of distant mountains was to our\nleft. We had crossed a river at the forest edge.\n\nI suppose we had been half an hour swimming those ten-miles. Was\ndaylight coming? It seemed that the sideline of mountain-tops had a\nlittle light on them. The opalescent beam from Earth had swept this\nportion of the sky and was gone below the horizon.\n\nApparently there was no pursuit from the city. Behind me, Venza\npanted, \"Say, I'm about finished. Can't we rest?\"\n\nWith this altitude we could cease our efforts and drift down. It would\ntake several minutes.\n\nWe gathered together, falling with a slow drift toward the dark forest\nunder us. The trees seemed huge and spindly, a porous growth something\non the Martian style, with huge leaves and a tangle of matter vines.\nThey came mounting up at us as we fell with slowly gathering speed.\n\n\"Shall we go on?\" I suggested.\n\n\"Yes.\" But she was tired, and Anita as well.\n\n\"Girls,\" I asked, \"where is the _Star-Streak_?\"\n\nThey did not know.\n\nAnita said, \"Perhaps we can land in the trees, and examine what\ndevices we have here.\"\n\nThe girls had carefully watched Molo upon several occasions. They\nthought we might find we had a hand-globe or a couple of the repulsive\nrays. With these we could attain rapid flight without effort.\n\nWe sank, fluttering, into a dark and tangled mass of the forest\ntree-top growth. I had understood that Wandl was crowded with its\nhuman population, yet this dark and silent forest evidently was\nuninhabited. We clung, like awkward birds, to a swaying limb of a\ntree-top. The trees were close together.\n\n\"Let's see what you've got,\" Venza demanded.\n\nWe handed the girls the various devices we had taken from Wyk. Most of\nthem were the size of my fist: globular metallic projectors like hand\nbombs; ray cylinders; a device with multiple barrels the size of one's\nfinger, set in a small circumference of a circular grid of wires.\n\nAnita said, \"I saw Molo with one of these. He killed an unwilling\nworker on the ship.\"\n\n\"I'll take a look around,\" Snap said anxiously. \"Suppose we're being\nfollowed? Give me that weapon.\"\n\nThere was vegetation partly over us, so that the sky was half\nobscured. Snap took the weapon, and like a monkey swaying\nprecariously, he ran and leaped among the upper branches, crashing his\nway until he could see back toward the horizon beyond which lay the\ncity of Wor.\n\nWe heard his voice. \"All clear. Nothing in sight. You coming up?\nBetter get started.\"\n\nI put the weapons in my pocket. Snap had one now in the branches over\nus. I was examining an electronic bolt, when suddenly there came\nSnap's call. \"Gregg! Look out!\"\n\nWe heard the hiss and saw the flash of his bolt.\n\nAnita swung at me. \"Gregg, see there!\"\n\nI followed her gesture, and then I knew why this forest was shunned by\nhumans!\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\nThe forest swarmed with living things. Here in the dark they had been\ncrawling upon us. Every branch of this leafy tree-top angle had\nsomething staring at us; the darkness was suddenly glowing with a\nmyriad little green torches which were their eyes. They all winked on\nin an instant, as though at a signal, or at the sound of Snap's shout\nand the hiss of his bolt.\n\nInsects? I suppose I should call them that. With a glance I saw that\nthey were of many sizes and shapes; tiny little things with eyes like\nlanterns; things of many legs, finger-length, hand-length, and some as\nlong as my forearm. Brown-shelled things, with eyes glowing on stems.\nThere was one quite near us, a smooth, brown-shelled body; a round\nhead on top, as big as my fist. And these things had heads like little\ndistended brains.\n\nWhat horrible jest of nature this was, with miniatures of the Wandl\nworkers, crawling here, unable to stand erect, groping with little\npincers. And miniature brains with naked, shriveled bodies.\n\nIt seemed that the eyes of that little brain were fixed on me with a\nbaleful green glare in the darkness. Anita and Venza were floundering\nto their feet in horror. They all but slipped from the limb. The\nweapons and devices they had arranged there slid off and went down\ninto the darkness unheeded. From above us came Snap's horrified shouts\nand the hiss of his bolts.\n\n\"Here!\" I gasped. \"My hand--Anita, Venza, jump!\"\n\nI shoved Anita upward. The little eyes suddenly were all in movement,\nadvancing upon us. Anita floundered, fluttered, got into the air and\nmounted toward Snap. Again Venza slipped off the limb. I lunged and\ndrew her up. Green eyes nearest us came swooping. I did not dare fire\na bolt; it was too close to Venza. I flung the entire weapon at the\ngreen eyes, but I missed.\n\nThe little thing bit Venza's arm. She screamed and her flailing hand\nhit the tiny distended head. Its hideous little scream mingled with\nhers. It floated downward, massed and purple-red with gushing blood.\n\nI struggled upward with the inert form of Venza under one arm. Anita\nwas mounting, free. Snap came lunging down.\n\n\"Fired every bolt in the damn weapon!\" He saw the unconscious Venza.\n\"Good God, Gregg!\"\n\nNever have I heard such anguish in his tone. \"Gregg, she isn't....\"\n\n\"One of them bit her. Help me.\"\n\nHe floundered up with her, a hundred feet above the tree-tops of that\nhorrible forest. The little lanterns of eyes down there had all winked\nout. The open starlight was over us.\n\nAnita came swimming, then Venza stirred. She murmured, \"... all\nright.\"\n\nShe had fainted. It seemed nothing more; but I found her upper arm\nswelling. She tried to bend her body and sit up; but it threw us all\nout of balance.\n\n\"Lie straight,\" Snap murmured. \"Venza, are you all right?\"\n\n\"Yes. Why not?\" And then she laughed. It sent a shuddering chill over\nme. \"What's the fuss about? Let's get away from here. Somebody will be\ncoming.\"\n\nShe was swimming now and we let her loose, but stayed close by her.\nThe reddish firmament was like an inverted bowl. The curving Wandl\nsurface gave us a narrow little vista, the forest rolling up from the\nhorizon in front. Then we saw where the forest seemed to end. Water\nwas beyond it: a ribbon like a broad river, and beyond that, frowning\nmountains, terraced and spired with jagged peaks.\n\nSnap and I suddenly recalled the gravity ray projectors. We tried\nthem; found that they would fling little beams of two varieties.\nPencil points of radiance, they seemed to have an effective range of\nno more than a few hundred feet.\n\nI let myself drift downward, experimenting. The tiny beam struck the\nforest-top. I felt the projector pulling violently downward in my\nhand. I clung to it. I was being drawn swiftly down by the attractive\ngravity force of the ray. The forest rose rapidly under me: I was all\nbut flung upon it before I could find the other controls.\n\nThen the ray altered its nature; the projector in my hand pulled me\nsteadily up. But after a few hundred feet, I felt I was mounting only\nof my own momentum, with gravity and air-friction retarding me.\n\nSnap had tried similar experiments. We rejoined the swimming girls. I\nstared into Venza's face; it was pale but she did not seem distressed.\nShe winked at me.\n\n\"How's your arm, Venza?\"\n\n\"It hurts, but I guess it's all right.\"\n\nI turned to Snap. \"I guess we can work these things. Get Venza to\ncling to you.\"\n\nOur progress now was far less difficult. Venza clung to Snap's ankles\nand Anita to mine. With the repulsing rays directed downward, we had a\nstrong upward and forward thrust. We went forward with great\nthousand-foot bounds. The forest rolled back under us. We came over\nthe gleaming river. It seemed several miles broad. It appeared to have\na swift current.\n\nI saw sunlight upon the mountain ahead. The darkness had been paling.\nNow day suddenly burst upon us. The sun, smaller than on Earth,\nmounted swiftly up. It was a flattened, distorted, dull-red disc,\nblurred by Wandl's strange atmosphere. We were in a dim red daylight.\n\nAnita twitched at my ankles. \"Look back of us!\"\n\nWe were going up. Venza and Snap, behind us, were in a descending arc.\nAbove them, far back in the direction from which they had come, two\nblobs were visible up against the reddish day sky.\n\nPursuit? It seemed so. The blobs went down, but came up again,\ntraveling with rays, like ourselves.\n\nI called to Snap, \"Someone after us! Two figures back there!\"\n\nHe was shouting, \"Gregg! Gregg, help!\"\n\nMy gaze had been on the distant figures. I saw now that at the bottom\nof his arc, and starting upward again, Snap had lost Venza. The\nimpulse of his ray had twitched his ankle from her grasp. Or had she\nlet loose? He was about a hundred feet above the river, and Venza,\nwith acceleration downward unchecked, was falling into it.\n\n\"Gregg, help! Venza, swim up!\" His frenzied call reached me as I used\nthe attractive ray and Anita and I whirled over and lunged downward.\n\n\"Gregg, help! Venza use your arms! Swim!\"\n\nShe was lying inert, making no effort to keep from falling. Her body\nturned slowly, end-over-end. She struck the swiftly-flowing river\nsurface but did not sink; instead, she half emerged, came up and lay\nin a crumpled heap; and with its rapid current, the river carried her\naway.\n\nIt was several minutes before we could reach Venza. Snap was already\nthere, floundering on the water, awkwardly maintaining his balance,\nbending over Venza. \"Gregg, she's unconscious. Fainted again.\"\n\nThe bite of that insect! The thought of it turned me cold.\n\nThe river surface was like a very soft rubber mattress. The water\nclung to us, wet us. We could not kneel or stand erect; but in sitting\ndown only a few inches of our bodies were submerged. We floated like\ncorks, we were so light, and so little water did we displace.\n\nWe struggled with Venza across the gluey river surface. She had fallen\nnear the further shore. Rocks, crags and strewn boulders were passing\nas the current swept us along at a speed of about ten miles an hour.\nShe lay in our arms, eyes closed, her face pallid but calm. She seemed\nto breathe rapidly; but that on Wandl was normal.\n\nWe landed on the rocky shore. It was still daylight. The blurred sun\nwas winging across the zenith so swiftly that its movement was\nvisible. Wandl had been suddenly endowed with axial rotation. Even in\nthese few minutes, the day was past its noon. On the distant mountain\npeaks looming above the nearby horizon; it seemed that the sheen of\ncoming night was mingled with the red sunlight.\n\nAnita and Snap laid Venza on the rocks. I suddenly remembered the two\nblobs in the sky behind us, which had seemed to be following. I stood\ngazing across the river. The red sky there seemed empty.\n\n\"Thank God, she's reviving!\" Snap called at me and I joined them.\nVenza was stirring. Color was coming into her cheeks. Her lips were\nmurmuring as though she were talking in her sleep.\n\nThen she opened her eyes. Her gaze fixed on us as we bent over her.\n\"Why, what's the matter? Where are we? I thought we were in the\ntree-tops. Snap, don't look at me like that, dear. I'm all right--only\nconfused.\"\n\nShe could remember nothing since that gruesome thing bit into her arm,\nbut the attack of its poison in her veins seemed definitely over. We\nsat with her, soothing her, explaining what had happened. And she was\nwholly rational. Her strength came back; her mind cleared.\n\nThe brief red day came to its close. The sun plunged below the\nhorizon; the stars winked into being. The red-purple Wandl night\nagain was here. And now we saw that the whole firmament was swinging,\nthe rotation made visible.\n\nThe darkness leaped around us. Shadows filled the rock hollows. The\ncaves and recesses of this rocky shore turned black with darkness. And\nin the sky now we saw another of those familiar opalescent beams. This\nwas the one from Mars: we could identify the red disc of the planet.\n\nAnd then, from the mountains ahead of us but still below our horizon,\nthe Wandl control station shot its attacking beam upward. Again there\nwas that conflict in the sky. The axis of Mars was being altered, its\nrotation slowed.\n\nWe could see now that we were much nearer than before to the control\nstation. It seemed only about twenty miles ahead of us. The scream\nfrom it was deafening.\n\nThe Wandl beam died presently. The electrical scream from the control\nstation was stilled.\n\nThe Earth's axis had been altered. Now Mars; and next would be Venus.\nA few more of these gravitational attacks and then the helpless\nplanets, with rotation checked, would be towed away by Wandl, out into\nthe deadly cold of interstellar space.\n\nAnita abruptly gave a startled outcry. The four of us, sitting in a\ngroup, had no time to rise. From behind a dark crag nearby, two\nfigures appeared. The starlight showed them clearly.\n\nMolo and Wyk! They lunged forward at us.\n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\nWe were unarmed. I had flung my weapon at the thing in the forest; and\nSnap had exhausted all his bolts firing at the multitude of green\neyes. Molo and Wyk came with a dive through the air. Two tiny flashes\nleaped from them to the rocks behind them, and flung them forward.\n\nSnap and I seized Venza and Anita. It was a second of confusion; then\nI saw we would not be able to rise in time. The driving, oncoming\nfigures were no more than twenty feet away.\n\n\"Protect Venza, Snap! Get her behind you!\"\n\nSnap shoved Venza behind him; I got myself in front of Anita. We had\nalmost gained our feet. I tried to thrust Anita and myself violently\nupward. We rose, but only a few feet. And then we were struck by the\noncoming body of Wyk, like a huge, light-shelled, three-pound insect\nlunging in mid-air against us. The two longest tentacle arms wrapped\naround us. Anita twisted and kicked. The gruesome, goggling face of\nWyk thrust itself almost into mine. The hollow voice panted, \"I have\nyou fast.\"\n\nOne of my arms was free and I struck with my fist at the gaping,\nupended mouth. There was a crack. My fist sank through the shell; a\ncold, sticky ooze spurted out.\n\nWyk screamed. His encircling arms fell away. The grisly smashed face\nwas white with ooze and pulp where my fist had gone in.\n\nWe had sunk back to the rocks. I kicked the dead body of Wyk away.\n\n\"Anita! Swim up!\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\nSinking beside us were the flailing bodies of Molo, Snap and Venza\nwere drifting down. They seemed intermingled. Snap was shouting: \"No\nyou don't! Drop that!\"\n\nI leaped for them. Something long and thin and glowing was dangling\nfrom Molo's hand. He broke loose from the struggling Snap and Venza;\nhis feet struck the rocks and he shoved himself backward. My leap had\ncarried me too high. I saw that in his hand was a six-foot length of\nglowing wire. He whirled it. The weight on its end described an arc,\nand then he flung the handle. The weighted wire struck Venza and Snap\njust as their repulsive ray shot down against the rocks and shoved\nthem upward. The whirling wire wrapped itself around them, bound them\ntogether. Its glow vanished. Snap had been shouting, \"Gregg, come up.\"\nBut it died in his throat.\n\nAll this while, in those few seconds, I was vaulting over Molo, trying\nto get back to the ground to leap again. I saw that Anita was crawling\non the rocks. My gravity cylinder was at my belt. I had jammed it\nthere to leave my hands free just as Wyk struck me.\n\nI saw that Snap and Venza, wrapped together by the wire, had dropped\ntheir gravity projector. Their entwined figures went up some fifty\nfeet and stopped; then began drifting down.\n\nMolo was shouting, \"You, Gregg Haljan! Now for you!\"\n\nI struck the rocks and fell twenty feet beyond him. I jerked out my\ngravity projector, but I did not know what I wanted to do with it. And\nin that second I saw that the standing Molo was aiming at me. Directly\nover my head the inert bound bodies of Venza and Snap were falling.\n\nA flash leaped over the dark rocks from Molo. There was a split-second\nwhen I thought it was the end of me. But I was still alive. The bodies\nof Venza and Snap struck my head and shoulders; knocked me down. I\nfelt Molo's ray upon me. Not death, but only his gravity ray, like a\ngiant hand pulling me. Apparently he wanted us alive. I was scrambling\non the rocks, entangled with Venza and Snap. Molo's radiance clung.\nAll three of us went tumbling forward toward him. I flashed my own\nray, but I was rolling end over end, and it went wild.\n\nI dropped it, saw Molo's beam vanish, saw his upright standing figure\ntowering above me. Snap, Venza and I were in a heap at his feet. He\nleaned down and seized me. \"Now, Gregg Haljan, I will teach you not to\ntry escaping like this!\"\n\nWith the huge, muscular Martian gripping me, his fist striking for my\nface but missing and hitting my shoulder, this was a semblance of\nnormality. I could understand fighting like this. I wrapped my legs\naround him; my fingers reached for his brawny throat as he kicked us\ninto the air free of the entangling bodies of Snap and Venza.\n\nWe rose a few feet and sank back, gripping each other, lunging and\nstriking. He was very powerful, this Martian. I caught the round\npillar of his throat with my hands. For an instant I shut off his\nwind, but I could not hold the grip. He struck me a glancing blow in\nthe face, then the heel of his hand was under my chin. It forced back\nmy head, broke my hold on his throat. With returning breath, he gasped\nan inhalation. And I heard his exulting words: \"You are not strong\nenough!\"\n\nWe rolled and bumped over the rocks. I caught a blow from his fists\nfull in my face. It was almost the end; I felt my strength going. He\nlaughed as he struck away my answering swing. I was on my back against\nthe rocks, with his body on top of me. Then beyond and behind his\nhulking shoulder, silhouetted against the sky, I saw Anita rise up.\nShe was lifting a jagged gray mass of stone, full four feet in\ndiameter. She poised it, then crashed it down on Molo's head. He sank\naway from me; his arms relaxed. The boulder rolled beside him.\n\nIt was over now. Wyk was dead; his gruesome body with its smashed face\nlay near us. Molo was unconscious, breathing heavily, lying\nmotionless, with a wound on the back of his head, the blood welling\nout, matting his hair.\n\nAnita and I were uninjured, victorious--but what a hollow victory. On\nthe rocks here, bound together by that strange wire, Snap and Venza\nlay inert. We bent over them. The wire was cold to the touch now. It\nresisted our efforts to untwine it. We pulled frantically as we\npleaded: \"Snap, speak to us! Venza, can't you speak?\"\n\nTheir eyes were open. I was aware that there was no starlight above\nus, but instead, a lurid sky of flying clouds, shot with a greenish\ncast. The darkness here was green. The glow of it struck upon the\nwide-open staring eyes of Venza and Snap. It seemed that there was\nintelligence in those eyes.\n\n\"Snap, can't you hear us?\"\n\nHis eyelids came down and up again, slowly, as though by a horrible\neffort. \"Can you move, Snap?\"\n\nHis right eyelid moved. Was his answer, no?\n\nAnita and I had never felt so horrible a sense of aloneness as that\nwhich swept us in those succeeding minutes. A breeze was springing up\nin the lurid green night. It came from the mountains. It wafted across\nthe nearby river, rippling the surface which was now green and sullen.\nWe did not know where to go, what to do.\n\nWe found at last that we could untwist the stiffly clinging wire. We\nlaid Venza and Snap on the rocks side-by-side, about thirty feet back\nfrom the river. The glowing wire had burned their clothes only a\nlittle, as the current was absorbed by the contact with their bodies.\n\n\"Snap, are you in pain?\"\n\nHis eyes seemed to be trying to talk to me. Anita rose from Venza:\n\"Oh, Gregg, what shall we do? Can't we carry them?\"\n\nBut where? To what purpose? Wild thoughts thronged me: Wandl's control\nstation, bringing chaos and death upon Earth. Mars and Venus. What was\nthat now to me? I thought of Molo's ship.\n\n\"Anita, if we can get to the _Star-Streak_, seize it and escape from\nthis world....\"\n\n\"Carry Snap and Venza there now? But we don't know where it is. Can we\nmake Molo lead us?\"\n\nBut Molo lay unconscious. I could not rouse him.\n\nAnita and I were so alone! We clung together.\n\n\"Gregg, look at that sky!\"\n\nThe mounting wind was tugging at us. It whined through the dark\nmountain defiles, surged out over the river where the water now was\nbeginning to toss with waves crossing the swift current. The sky was\nshot with green shafts of radiance. Over us, the lowering, leaden\nclouds were scudding, riding the wind.\n\nIt burst now upon us; I found suddenly that Anita and I were bracing\nagainst it. A puff dislodged us, so that we were blown a dozen feet,\nbringing up against a crag, as though we were balloons.\n\n\"Anita--this wind--we can't maintain ourselves here. We....\"\n\nHorror checked me at the thought of Venza and Snap, lying there on the\nrocks. We saw the body of Wyk, like a great dried insect, lifted by\nthe wind, whirled like a brown leaf over and over, and carried away.\n\nA little pebble came hurtling and struck me. Then a rain of pebbles,\nlike hailstones was pelting at us.\n\nThe storm was probably caused by the axial rotation of Wandl. The\nlight-beam upon Earth had been attacked by the Wandl control station\nwithout axial rotation. But to attack the beam from Mars, a\nmanipulation of Wandl was necessary. The planet's rotation was\nstarted; and suddenly checked. It remained night now, here in this\nhemisphere. Perhaps there were natural storm tendencies here; perhaps\nthe operators of the control station were unduly eager, manipulating\nthe rotation too suddenly.\n\nAt all events, it was frightening. I shouted above its whine and the\nclatter of the pebbles: \"Hold onto me! We'll get to Venza and Snap.\"\n\nWe reached the two inert forms, where they had blown into a niche\nbetween two boulders. \"Can't stay here, Anita.\"\n\n\"No! If it begins again!\"\n\n\"Over there! A cave!\"\n\nWe got Venza and Snap into it, just as another gust came, with a rain\nof dirt and loose stones pelting past outside.\n\nSuddenly I thought of Molo. \"Anita, stay here! Must get to Molo.\"\n\n\"Gregg, no!\"\n\n\"I must. If we can bring him to consciousness, make him tell us where\nthe _Star-Streak_ is....\"\n\nI flung off her restraining hold. The wind had eased up. I leaped out\ninto it, swimming. The rocks slid by close under me in a swift\nsidewise drift. In a moment I would be carried out over the river. It\nwas a chaos of green, windswept darkness. But there was bursting light\nnow overhead and rumbling claps, like thunder.\n\nI saw Molo's body where the wind held him pinned against the side of a\nflat, ten-foot rock butte, and dove for him, swimming down frantically\nuntil I struck against the rock with a blow that almost knocked the\nbreath from me. Molo was still obviously unconscious.\n\nHow long it took me to get back to Anita, floundering with Molo's\nbody, I do not know. I managed to keep against the ground; was blown\nback, and struggled forward again. The wind came with strange puffs.\nIn one of the lulls, I hauled Molo through the air and into the cave.\n\n\"Gregg!\" Anita held to me, her arms around me. \"Gregg dear, you were\ngone so long!\"\n\nI was battered and bruised and breathless. The cave's mouth was like a\nten-foot tunnel leading downward into blackness.\n\n\"Gregg, I put Venza and Snap here.\"\n\nThey lay side by side, like two dead bodies, here in the greenish\ndarkness. We placed Molo with them. Together Anita and I crouched\nbeside them, clinging to each other, listening to the wild sweep of\nthe wind outside. The storm had burst into full fury now. It would\nwhirl us away like feathers, outside there now. The lightning and\nthunder hissed and crashed. Stones and boulders were being flung like\nhailstones.\n\nThis flimsy, weightless world! It seemed as though the rocks here on\nwhich we were crouching would be shifted and carried away.\n\n\"Gregg! Gregg, is this the end?\"\n\nA mass of rocks fell at the opening, closing it, so that we were\nburied here in the darkness. \"Anita, my darling, I will never stop\nloving you.\"\n\nDarkness, with her arms around me and a shuddering world outside. But\nhere, only Anita and her soft arms.\n\n\"Gregg!\"\n\nHorror was in her voice. Then I saw what she was seeing. It was not\njust Anita and I buried here in the darkness with the bodies of Snap\nand Venza and Molo. Something else was here.\n\nFrom the blackness of the cave, two green, glowing eyes were staring.\nTheir radiance showed me the outlines of a distended head. An insane\nthing? But it was not another of the forest insects. This seemed to be\nan animal. The glow of its distended head disclosed a lythe,\nhorizontal body, seemingly solid and muscled. A chattering, insane\nanimal, here in the dark with us! We heard mouthing, mumbling words,\nand an eerie, cackling laugh as it came padding toward us.\n\nThe thing in the cave stared at us as we clung together in the\ndarkness, transfixed for a moment by horror. The distended head,\nghastly of face with its green glowing eyes, wobbled upon a long,\nspindly neck. The eyes seemed luminous of their own internal light.\nThe radiance from them faintly lighted the black cave so we were able\nto see its tawny, hairy body. It was long sleek, the size of an Earth\nleopard. A muscled body, with ponderable weight, it was moving toward\nus, padding on the rocks.\n\nI recovered my wits and shoved Anita behind me. I crouched on one\nknee. There was no escape, nowhere to run. This tunnel was blocked by\na fallen rock mass behind us, with the wild storm raging outside. The\nthing was some twenty feet away, where the tunnel broadened into a\nblack cave of unknown size. Beside me Snap and Venza lay inert, the\nstill-unconscious Molo with them.\n\nThere was nothing to do but crouch here and protect Anita. I waved my\narms, shouted above the outside surge of the storm; my voice\nreverberated with a muffled roar in this subterranean darkness.\n\n\"Get back! Back! Back, away from me!\"\n\nIt stopped. Round ears stood up from the bloated head. Then it laughed\nagain. I felt Anita shoving a rock at my hand, a chunk of rock the\nsize of my head. \"Its face, Gregg! Aim for its face!\"\n\nThe rock felt like a ball of cork. I flung it and hit the thing on the\nbody. Its laughter checked abruptly; it crouched, as though gathering\nfor a spring.\n\nAnd then I thought of my gravity projector. I flashed on the repulsive\nray to its full intensity.\n\nThe tawny body leaped. It came hurtling, but my beam met it in\nmid-air. For a second I thought that I had been too late. The thing\nwas clawing the air; its momentum carried it against the push of my\nray. For an instant it hung, snarling, and then laughed that wild\nlaugh.\n\nThe ray forced it back. It receded through the air, back across the\nblackness of the cave, gathering speed until, in a moment it brought\nup against the opposite wall some forty feet away. There it hung,\npinned as I held the ray upon it. The body had struck the rocky wall\nbut the head was uninjured. It was writhing and twisting: the cave was\nfilled with the reverberations of its screams.\n\nOver the screams, I heard another voice: \"Oh Gregg, where are you?\"\n\nSnap! Behind me, Anita was moving sidewise toward where Snap and Venza\nwere lying. The thing pinned in my light stopped its screaming, with\ncuriosity perhaps at this new sound.\n\n\"Snap! We're here, Snap!\"\n\nThen Venza's voice: \"It's letting me talk. We're better now.\"\n\nThey were recovering, Anita was bending over them. \"Gregg, they're all\nright. The shock is wearing off, thank God.\"\n\nBut I did not dare move to them. My light on the snarling thing across\nthe cave held it, but I did not dare to relax my attention.\n\nI called, \"Stay with them, Anita.\" I moved slowly forward, holding the\nbeam steady. The cave floor was littered with loose stones and\nboulders. Ten feet from the pinned animal I selected a great chunk of\nrock. It towered in my hand, but the weight of it was only a few\npounds.\n\nThe gravity held the animal as though I had pinned it by a pole. From\nthe distance of a few feet I heaved the boulder. The palpitating head\nmashed against the wall. The body and the pulp of the head and the\nboulder sank to the floor when I removed the beam.\n\n\"Snap, thank God you've recovered! And you, Venza!\"\n\nAnita and I sat with them. They had been fully conscious all the\nwhile, but they were out of it now.\n\nAn hour passed while we sat crouched, listening to the storm.\n\n\"It's letting up,\" Venza said out of a silence.\n\nAnita was sitting over the prone form of Molo. He had stirred and\nmumbled several times.\n\n\"Let's see if we can get out of here,\" Snap suggested.\n\nRocks had fallen and blocked the only exit from the cave. But to our\nstrength, even the hugest of the rocks was movable.\n\n\"Shall we try it now, Gregg?\"\n\nAs though we were elephants, heaving and pushing, we struggled with\nthe litter choking the passage. There was a danger that the whole\nthing would cave in on us; but we were careful of that. We tossed the\nsmall rocks aside like pebbles. There was one main mass. Together we\npulled and tugged and shifted it. A small opening was disclosed, large\nenough for our bodies. The wind puffed in through it.\n\nThe girls called us. Molo had regained consciousness. The blow from\nthe rock had only stunned him. We bound his wrists with a portion of\nhis belt which we cut into strips.\n\n\"What is it you do with me? Is Wyk dead?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nHe lay silent and sullen. \"Look here, Molo, we're going to get out of\nthis, and you're going to help us. If you don't....\" The knife which\nwe had taken from him to cut his belt was in my hand. I drew its blade\nlightly across his throat. \"Will you talk freely and truthfully?\"\n\n\"Yes, I will talk the truth.\"\n\n\"Do you know where the control station is located?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Not far.\"\n\n\"The hell with that!\" Snap burst out. \"Get it meshed in your mind,\nMolo, that we're in no mood for talk like that. How far is it?\"\n\n\"On Earth you would call it ten miles.\"\n\n\"In these mountains?\"\n\n\"He told us it was,\" said Anita. \"Underground.\"\n\n\"Do you know where your ship is?\" I persisted.\n\nHe told us that it was some thirty miles in another direction, not in\nthe mountains, but in the outskirts of a city like Wor. It was\nequipped and ready for flight, all but the assembling of its crew.\n\nAnd now we had weapons! Molo was carrying several of the gravity\nprojectors; two small searchlight beams, little hand torches; and\nthree electronic ray-guns of short-range size.\n\nHope filled us. The storm was abating. We could creep upon the single\nsmall control room of the gravity station, where usually but two\noperators were stationed. The delicate mechanisms there could be\nwrecked.\n\nAnd then we would seize the _Star-Streak_. No one would be on the\nlookout for us. The fact that Molo's prisoners had escaped was as yet\nunknown; he and Wyk had not dared tell it. Meka was back there\nwaiting. Our absence from the globe dwelling might have been\ndiscovered; but Meka would say that we were with Molo. She was waiting\nthere, hoping that her brother and Wyk would recapture us. All this we\ndragged piecemeal from Molo.\n\nSnap and I shared the gravity projectors and the small electronic\nguns. \"Let's get started, Gregg. The storm seems over.\"\n\nIt was. We found the purple-red starry night again outside. The river\nwas lashed white with waves, but they were spent. There was only a\nmild warm breeze remaining.\n\nMolo's legs were free, but his wrists were lashed behind him. I hooked\nan arm under his, holding him like a huge, but light, oblong bundle.\nSnap called, \"Ready, Gregg?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nSnap flashed on his gravity ray and mounted, with the girls clinging\nto his ankles. Then I followed with Molo. By great arching swoops, we\nswung up into the frowning, tumbled mountains.\n\n\n\n\n15\n\n\n\"This will be the place to land, Gregg Haljan.\"\n\nWe were drifting down upon a barren region of naked crags, dark,\nfrowning rock-masses, broken and tumbled, as though by some great\ncataclysm of nature. Mountains upon the Moon could not be more\ndesolate of aspect.\n\nWe landed on the rocks. The heights here had a purple-red sheen from\nthe starlight. We had seen frequent evidence of the storm; and it\nshowed here. Rocks were abnormally piled in drifts; smooth areas\nshowed, where the pebbles, stones and boulders had been swept away by\nthe wind.\n\nSnap and the girls landed beside us. We spoke softly. None of us, not\neven Molo, knew how far sound would carry in this air.\n\n\"Where is the place from here?\" Snap demanded.\n\n\"Off there.\"\n\nMolo spoke with docile, guarded softness. He gestured with his head\nand shoulder. A quarter of a mile away, over these uplands, the broken\nland went down in a sharp depression.\n\n\"It is there. I think from here we should go on the ground. There is\nno guard, and I think seldom is anyone on top.\"\n\n\"If I help you now, if we should wreck the gravity controls, then\nWandl will be helpless to navigate space, or to interfere with the\nrotation of Earth, Mars and Venus. The allied worlds might then defeat\nthe Wandl ships in battle. If that happened, perhaps your governments,\nbecause of my help here, would forgive what my _Star-Streak_ has\ndone.\"\n\n\"Your piracy?\" I said.\n\n\"Yes. I am outlawed. I might be reinstated if you would speak the good\nwords for me.\"\n\n\"Maybe.\"\n\n\"Maybe even they would reward me. You think so, Gregg Haljan?\"\n\nHe wanted to be on the winning side; this suited us. \"Let's try it and\nsee, Molo. I'll speak plenty of good words for you.\"\n\nNow, as we landed on the uplands, he said, \"You will do best to free\nmy hands.\"\n\n\"Oh, no!\" Snap declared.\n\n\"But I am a good fighter. Something unexpected might come.\"\n\n\"Too good a fighter,\" I said. \"We trust you because we have to, Molo,\nbut no more than is necessary.\"\n\nA small recess in the rocks was near us. We put Molo there, with his\nhands bound, and with Anita and Venza to guard him. Venza held the\nelectronic gun; she knew how to fire it. The girls crouched in a\ndepression about twenty feet away. They could see Molo plainly; if he\nmoved, a flash of the gun would kill him. He knew that.\n\nThe girls gazed at us as we were ready to start. \"Good-by, Gregg.\nGood-by, Snap. Good luck!\"\n\n\"We won't be long. Sit where you are.\" Snap touched Venza's shoulder\nfor his good-by. \"Listen, Venza: Molo has already told us enough to\nenable us to find the ship. If he tries anything, kill him.\"\n\n\"Right,\" she said.\n\nWe left them. A minute or two, cautiously shoving ourselves along the\nrocks, and we were crouching there. The cauldron was about two hundred\nfeet broad and fifty feet deep; an irregular circular bowl. The\nstarlight gleamed on it, and there were dots of small artificial\nlight. We saw a group of small metal buildings, very low and squat,\nlike balls mashed down, flattened in a bulging disc-shape; between\nthem were tiny skeleton towers.\n\nThe towers, twice the height of a man, were spread at irregular\nintervals in a hundred-foot circle, with a group of three or four in\nthe center. There seemed some twenty of them. Taut wires connected\ntheir tops, each tower with every other, so that the wires were a\nlacework above the small disc buildings. The bottoms of the towers\nwere grounded with electrical contacts, and every tower had a ground\nconnection with each other by means of cables.\n\nFar to one side, across the bowl from us, was a single globe-dwelling\nwith lighted windows. From its ground doorway, a narrow metal catwalk\nextended like a sidewalk on the ground, winding and branching among\nthe towers and discs.\n\nThis was the exterior of the Wandl gravity station. It lay silent and\ndark, save for the starlight and the little lights on the towers. No\nsign of humans. Then we saw movement in the globe-dwelling. A man came\nto the doorway, gazed at the sky and went back.\n\nI whispered, \"Which is the best entrance to the underground rooms?\"\n\nWe saw where, at several points, the winding catwalk terminated in\nlow, dome-like kiosks, giving ingress downward. One was on our slope\nof the cauldron. \"That's the one we'll try,\" Snap murmured.\n\nHe stopped suddenly. The top of the distant globe-dwelling was\nglowing. A little round patch there was radiant, like a lighted\nwindow. A transparent ray was coming from inside. The operators within\nthis globe were observing the sky, training instruments upon it, no\ndoubt.\n\nAnd now we saw in the sky the third of those sword-like beams. It had\nprobably been visible there for some time but we had not noticed it.\n\"That's Venus,\" I murmured.\n\nIt seemed so. A blurred star, red in this atmosphere, was close above\nthe horizon. The light-beam stood out from it, sweeping up to the\nzenith.\n\nThe gravity station here was about to make contact with the Venus\nbeam. We heard a muffled siren, a signal echoing from the subterranean\ncontrol rooms. The current went into all these wires and towers and\ntwenty-foot ground discs. The hissing and throbbing hum of it was\naudible. The discs and towers were glowing; red at first, then violet.\nThen that milky, opalescent white. The overhead wire-aerials were\nsnapping with a myriad of tiny jumping sparks.\n\nI saw now that the top of each tower was a grid of radiant wires, a\nsix-foot circular projector with a mirror reflector close beneath it\nand a series of prisms and lenses just above. It all glowed opalescent\nin a moment, a dazzling glare.\n\nThen the tower tops were swinging. The lights from them had reached\nthe intensity of an upflung beam, and the projectors were swinging to\nfocus the beam inward. The focal point seemed about a thousand feet\noverhead. All the beams merged there; and guided by the towers\ndirectly underneath, a single shaft was standing into the sky.\n\nThe entire cauldron depression was now a blinding mass of opalescent\nlight. We could see nothing but the milk-white inferno of glare. It\npainted the rocks up here on the rim so that we shrank back, shaded\nour eyes and gazed into the sky. And from the cauldron, the hum and\nthe hiss of the current, the snapping of sparks, were all lost in a\nwild electrical screaming turmoil.\n\nOverhead, we saw the Wandl beam from Venus.\n\nApparently this control station had two functions: the control of the\nplanet's movements, its axial rotation and its orbital flight, and its\nability to apply gravitational force to other celestial bodies.\n\nWandl was controlling her own movements by applying gravity force,\nattraction and repulsion, to all the celestial starfield; and\ndoubtless also by applying the repulsive beam tangentially against the\nether like rocket streams. In this respect, I realized, the planet was\nprobably operated not unlike one of our familiar spaceships. In\neffect, it was itself a gigantic globular vehicle. Later I learned\nthat it was thought that Wandl's atmosphere could be highly\nelectronized at will, with a resulting aberration of the natural\nlight-ray reflected from her into space. This could have caused the\nblurring of the image of Wandl when viewed telescopically from other\nworlds.\n\nAgain, for a moment of the contact, there was that bursting light in\nthe sky.\n\nThe contact with the Venus beam lasted a minute or two. Snap and I, on\nthe cauldron rim, were engulfed in the blaze of reflected light and\nthe wild scream of sound. Then presently the turmoil subsided. The\ncontact in the sky was broken. The tow-rope of Venus jerked itself\naway. But on the next Venus rotation it would be attacked again.\n\nAnother few minutes passed. The little circular depression beneath us\nwas dim and silent as we had first seen it. Figures were moving within\nthe dwelling structure. From several of the underground entrances\nfigures came up, the ten-foot insect-like shapes of workers. Three or\nfour of the brains came bouncing up, moving along the ground catwalk\nwith little leaps. All the figures entered the distant main dwelling\nhouse. The contact was over.\n\n\"Probably hardly anyone left down below,\" Snap whispered. \"Now's our\nchance.\"\n\n\"If we can get into that opening without being seen,\" I said.\n\n\"Shadows, down the rocks to the left. Damnation, Gregg, we can make it\nin one calculated leap.\"\n\n\"I'll try it first. I'll get in and wait for you.\"\n\n\"Right.\"\n\nWe each had a gravity cylinder at our belt and a ray-gun in our hand.\nThe slope of the depression was dim here, merely starlit; it was a\nsteep, broken and fairly shadowed descent, fifty feet to the little\ndome-like kiosk which marked the nearest subterranean entrance. I went\ndown it with a swoop, landed in a heap beside the kiosk and ducked\ninto it. Instinct made me fear a guard, but reason told me none would\nbe here; there was only the danger of encountering someone coming up.\n\nI was at the top of a winding, descending passage, a step-terraced\nfloor; there were occasional lights in the ceiling. In a moment Snap\njoined me. \"Got here! I wonder how far down it goes?\"\n\nI gripped him. \"Snap, no matter what happens, do it with a rush. Keep\nwith me. And if I shout to get out....\"\n\n\"We go out with a rush!\"\n\n\"Yes. Back to the girls. Use your ray-gun and the gravity projector in\ngetting back to them and get away without me, if I fall.\"\n\n\"Same for you, Gregg.\"\n\nWe went down the deserted passage. We had had experience in movement\non Wandl now; we handled ourselves more deftly. We went down several\nhundred feet. The passage branched, but there always seemed a main\ntunnel.\n\nIt was all deserted. There were distant, dimly-lighted, silent rooms.\nWere these factories of the strange forms of electronic gravity\ncurrents Wandl used? Some were in operation. A hum issued from them.\nWorkers moved about.\n\nWe stopped to consult. The girls, and Molo himself, had described what\nwe would find: a main route leading to the control room where the\ndelicate mechanisms which operated all this were centralized, the\nnerve center of Wandl. It seemed that we were following that main\nroute.\n\nA worker came with a swimming leap past us. We dropped into a hollowed\nshadow at a tunnel intersection, and he went swooping by.\n\n\"Lord, Snap,\" I muttered, \"that was too close for comfort.\"\n\nAgain we advanced. The tunnel turned sharply. Down a short slope, a\nglowing room was disclosed, with two or three workmen moving within\nit.\n\nThe main control room! We could not doubt it. Molo, in his enthusiasm,\nhad once described it clearly to the girls, its great skeins of little\nthread-like wires spread upon the walls, the myriad tiny opalescent\ndiscs contacted with the small gray rock surface under the tangled\nmasses of thread-wire, the levers and dials banked on the circular\ntables: they were unmistakable features.\n\n\"There it is, Snap,\" I whispered in his ear. \"In that central rack.\nThose insulated rods, see them? Anita told us they used them to adjust\nthe discs. Watch out for the current.\"\n\n\"But it's off now, Gregg!\"\n\n\"There's still danger in it, and you'd short-circuit somewhere. Keep\nyour hands off. Use the rods.\"\n\n\"The operators....\"\n\nHe got no further. A figure lunged into us from behind, a giant\nworker! His largest pincer bit into my shoulder; his hollow shout\nresounded. The operators of the control room came with leaps at us.\n\nThere was a moment of wild confusion. Light, seemingly almost\nweightless bodies flapped against us. Arms gripped us, but they were\nflimsy. The huge body-shells cracked gruesomely as we struck with our\nsolid fists.\n\nA moment of turmoil passed. No bolts were fired. The shouts were brief\ndown here in the narrow confines of the tunnel. Panting, bruised more\nby our collisions against the rocks than by our adversaries, we ceased\nour wild lunges. We did not look at the scattered, broken and crushed\nbodies drifting now to the floor.\n\n\"Now, Snap! Hurry! Others may come.\"\n\nWe lunged into the glowing control room, seized the long insulated\npoles from the central rack. They had a grateful feel of weight. I\npicked one up, jumped with a twenty foot leap to the wall.\n\nThe wires came down like cobwebs under my sweeping blows; the little\ndiscs knocked off as though they were fungus growth. Sparks flew\naround us. Shafts of electronic radiance spat out. The wall was\nhissing over all its length as I ranged up and down it. The tangled\nbroken threads of wire writhed like living things on the floor; then\ncrumpled, fused and turned black.\n\nI swept that wall-segment with frantic haste, lunged around and\nstarted another way. Across the room I saw Snap doing the same. A\nturmoil of electrical sound was reverberating around us, deafening,\nand the glare was blinding. A belt-shaft shot from the wreckage under\nmy rod. It seared my left arm. My sleeve burned off; the arm hung limp\nand tingling at my side. I stopped to rub it; in a moment strength\ncame back to its muscles.\n\nSnap was raging like a great heavy bird gone amok. Through the green\nfumes of electrical gases which were filling the room I saw him\nlunging at the circular tables, overturning them. They cracked like\nthin polished stone as they struck the metal floor.\n\nI finished with the wall. There was a twenty-foot square piece of\nmetal apparatus, ramified and intricate; I heaved it over upon its\nside. A thousand little mirrors and prisms, dislodged from it, came\nout in a splintering deluge.\n\nI was aware of Snap fighting with a brown-shelled figure. Then he was\nfree of it. I saw it mashed and broken at his feet as I dove past,\nswimming in the smoke to lunge the length of a great fluorescent tube\nwhich was still dimly glowing. My pole pried it over; it crashed with\na brief puff of light and the rush of an explosion as air went into\nits vacuum.\n\nI found Snap panting beside me, clinging to me in mid-air. The glare\nwas dying around us; the din was lessening. We were choking in the\nchemical fumes of the released, half-burned gases. Turgid darkness was\ncoming to the wrecked room, with little hissing flares spitting\nthrough it.\n\n\"Enough, Gregg! Listen! Up overhead....\"\n\nA great siren from up there was screaming into the night.\n\nSnap panted, \"Got to get out of here. Can't breathe.\"\n\nTogether we lunged for the tunnel by which we had entered. I stood a\nmoment, gazing back upon the strewn and scattered room.\n\nThe delicate nerve-center of Wandl. Heavy green-black gas fumes\nswirled in it; darkness and silence closed down.\n\n\n\n\n16\n\n\nOver us was turmoil, that screaming siren. Then suddenly it was\nchecked and we heard the thump and swish of what on Earth would have\nbeen called running footsteps and shouts.\n\nSnap shoved me. \"Don't stay there, you fool!\"\n\nWe lunged up the passage. Figures barred it but they scattered; a bolt\nhissed at us, but missed. At the kiosk a group of workers and several\npeering little brains leaped away in terror to let us pass.\n\nWe gained the open air. With the small gravity rays darting down with\nrepulsion upon the rocks we mounted like rockets out of the cauldron.\nThe upper plateau lay silent in the starlight, but the cauldron behind\nus was ringing with alarm, and again the danger siren was blaring.\n\nI changed my way of direction, swung it to the plateau rocks ahead.\nThe arc of my flight was sharply bent as I went hurtling down. Over\nme, I saw Snap use the same tactics. I tried to aim for where we had\nleft the girls and Molo. I could not see them down there amid the\nstarlit crags; and suddenly a wild apprehension filled me. How had we\ndared leave them to Molo's trickery?\n\nThen, ahead and below me, I saw the slight figure of one of the girls,\nstanding on a rock with arms outstretched to signal us. I changed my\nray to repulsion barely in time to avoid crashing. The landing flung\nme in a heap. Twenty feet away, Snap came whirling down. We picked\nourselves up, saw Anita waving from the rock, and bounded to her.\n\nThe girls were safe. Venza sat intent, with unwavering watchful gaze\nacross the intervening space to where Molo had flattened himself\nagainst his rock, not daring to move.\n\n\"Still got him,\" Venza exulted. \"He wasn't willing to take any chances\nwith us. You did it, Snap?\"\n\n\"I'm a motor-oiler if we didn't. Come on; got to get out of this.\nThey're after us! We wrecked the whole damn place, Venza. Wandl's a\nnormal planet now. No more of this accursed dislocation of Earth.\"\n\nWe learned later that our hope and our assumption that we had\nirretrievably wrecked the entire gravity control system of Wandl was\nproven to be a fact. Wandl was, in effect, a normal celestial body\nnow. The beams planted in Greater New York, Ferrok-Shahn and Grebhar\nstill streamed across space. But there was no giant beam from Wandl to\nseize them, and Wandl now could not move through space of her own\nvolition. Like Earth, and all other known planets, satellites, comets\nand asteroids, she was subject now to all the normal natural laws of\ncelestial mechanics. We had done a thorough job of it.\n\nNow I shoved at Snap. \"No time to talk. You tow the girls; I'll take\nMolo. Got to get to the _Star-Streak_.\"\n\nI lunged over and seized Molo. \"We did it. Now for your vessel! It\nwill be ill for you if she is not where you say she is.\"\n\n\"She will be there, Gregg Haljan.\"\n\nHe docilely put himself in position for me to hook my forearm under\nhis crossed, bound wrists and carry him. Snap rose up past us, towing\nthe girls. Over the nearby cauldron a figure mounted to gaze and see\nthe nature of this strange attacking enemy, and then sank back.\n\nWith Molo hanging to me, I mounted with my ray, following Snap and the\ngirls into the starlight, with the turmoil of the cauldron receding\nuntil in a moment or so it was gone behind our horizon.\n\nWe headed now, not toward Wor, whence we had come, but over at an\nangle to the side. Our great bounding arcs soon left the mountains\nbehind. We crossed the river, another portion of the forest, and came\nover undulating lowlands.\n\nIt was a flight of under half an hour. The pursuit, if indeed anyone\nfollowed us, remained below our little segment of curving horizon.\nEverywhere there was evidence of the storm; the forest trees were laid\nflat, strewn like driftwood over the area. The river had in several\nplaces lashed over its banks. The lowlands were dotted thick with\nglobe-dwellings. Some were hanging awry on their stems; others were\npulled from their place, cracked and piled into a litter.\n\nWe kept well aloft. The surface scenes were only glimpses of wreckage,\nmoving lights and people. And there were areas which the wind had\nseemingly spared.\n\nThe confusion from the storm was mingled now with the spreading alarm\nfrom the gravity station; the sound of the danger siren there was\nstill audible behind us. As we advanced into what now seemed the\noutskirts of a city like Wor, with a pile of solid-looking metal\nstructures ranging the horizon ahead, I saw a distant spaceship rise\nup and wing away. Wandl was proceeding with the dispatching of her\nspace navy to oppose the distantly gathering ships of Earth, Venus,\nand Mars. No doubt with the wrecking of the control station, the\nmasters of Wandl immediately recognized the paramount importance of\nthe coming battle.\n\nThe huge, globular, disc-like ship sailed high over us, rotating with\nthe impulse of its rocket-streams. In a moment it was lost in the\nstars. And then another rose and followed it.\n\nThere were many human figures in the air around us now. I mounted\nhigher, and Snap with the girls followed me. The figures, intent upon\ntheir own affairs, did not seem to heed us.\n\nMolo's vessel lay alone upon a low metal cradle. No other ship was\nnear it; but half a mile away on both sides we could see others\nresting on their stages. Lights were moving around and upon them, but\nthe _Star-Streak_ was dark and neglected.\n\nWe poised a thousand feet over her, and to one side. I saw her as a\nlong, low, pointed vessel, dead gray in color, longer than the\n_Cometara_, and seemingly narrower, but very similar in aspect.\n\n\"Meka and I are supposed to be gathering our crew,\" said Molo. \"No one\nbothers with my vessel. Will you take me to Wor now to get Meka?\"\n\n\"I will not.\"\n\nSnap was drifting down with the girls. They were near us. His arm\nwaved at me with a gesture. And then came the muffled tone of his\nvoice: \"Shall we drop down, Gregg?\"\n\n\"Yes, but cautiously. Have your gun ready.\"\n\nMolo protested, \"I would like to take Meka with us, and a few of my\ncrew. You will have trouble handling the _Star-Streak_, just us three\nmen.\"\n\n\"We'll take our chances.\"\n\nWe dropped swiftly down upon the dark and vacant platform. The gray\nhull of the _Star-Streak_ loomed beside us, her dome arched still\nhigher. An inclined catwalk went up to her opened deck-port.\n\n\"I'll go first,\" I said softly to Snap. \"Come quickly after me. Watch\nout: there might be someone on board.\"\n\nVenza still clung to her weapon. Mine was in my hand as I lifted Molo.\nAnd, ignoring the incline, bounded the thirty feet for the deck-port.\nI landed safely, and stood Molo upon his feet. \"Don't you move,\" I\nadmonished him sternly.\n\nHe stood docilely against the cabin wall of the superstructure. No one\nhere. We had thought there might easily be one or two workers on\nboard.\n\nSnap and the girls came sailing, one after the other, and landed on\nthe deck beside me. We stood silent, alert. No one appeared from\nwithin the cabin or from the lengths of the deck. Venza was watching\nMolo with her weapon upon him. Snap and I had planned this boarding:\nAnita and Venza to stay here and guard Molo while we searched the\nship, and inspected the controls. We started for the cabin door oval.\n\n\"Gregg!\"\n\nIt was all the warning Snap could give. I was within the dim cabin,\nbut he, behind me, was still on the deck. I whirled to see a dozen\ndark forms leaping from the roof of the cabin superstructure. Snap was\nall but buried by them. These were not men of Wandl, but Molo's pirate\ncrew, Martians, Earthmen and Venusians. Snap's ray-gun spat as he went\ndown; one of the men dropped away. I saw Venza turn with startled\nhorror, as the huge figure of Meka leaped down upon her and Anita from\nthe roof.\n\nFor an instant, weapon in hand, I paused in the doorway. I could not\nfire into the turmoil of that struggling group, so instead plunged\ninto it, striking with my fists.\n\nMolo was shouting, \"Do not kill them! I was ordered not to kill them!\"\n\nThese men, so different from the insect-like workers and the brains of\nWandl, were solid in my grip; but we were all so weightless! I felled\none, but others gripped me, pounded me. A struggling mass of bodies,\narms and legs, we surged up to the superstructure roof and dropped\nupon it. My weapon was gone. Half a dozen adversaries had me pinioned.\n\nDown on the deck I saw that Venza had lost her weapon; Molo and Meka\nwere clutching her. Snap was fighting with several antagonists. Anita\nwas loose. She dove for the group in which Snap was struggling, hit\nthem, kicked and bounded upward, to be seized by two of my own\ncaptors.\n\n\"Anita, don't fight! They'll kill you!\"\n\nI tried to break loose, but four huge Martians were holding me.\n\n\"Oh, Gregg!\"\n\nThere was horror in Anita's voice. Snap had broken away. At the open\ndeck-port he stood, as though undecided what to do. The deck was\nalmost black around him; he was silhouetted against the outside\nstarlight. From almost at his side, in the darkness, a tiny bolt spat\nupward at his head. His arms went wildly out; he tumbled backward. At\nthe top of the boarding incline his body seemed spasmodically to kick,\nand the thrust whirled it down into the darkness.\n\nThe end of Snap! A pang went through me. Snap, my best friend!\n\nMolo cursed the unknown man of his crew who had fired the shot. But\nnone would admit who did it.\n\n\"Get to your posts,\" Molo roared in Martian. \"Enough of you are here.\nLash up the prisoners; we're launching away now.\" He thumped his\nbrawny sister as she passed him. \"Well played, Meka!\"\n\nThese wily Martians! Molo had planned that Meka was to gather the crew\nand wait here at the ship for him and Wyk. If they returned with us as\ncaptives, it would be here that they would come. But if by chance\nthings went adversely, Molo reasoned we would act just as we did; and\nMeka and her men were lurking here in ambush, waiting for us.\n\nAll the many various ports swung shut. Anita, Venza, and I, with arms\nand legs bound, were taken by Molo to the forward observation and\ncontrol room.\n\nThe ship was resounding with signals. The interior controls in the\nhull-base raised the gravity-pull within the vessel to a strength\ncomparable to that of Earth. Within a few minutes the _Star-Streak_\nlifted from the stage. Strange, weird Wandl fell away from us. We\nslid upward through the atmosphere, following one of the globular\nWandl vessels, and headed into space toward the point where, a few\nmillion miles distant, the ships of allied Earth, Venus, and Mars were\ngathering.\n\n\n\n\n17\n\n\n\"They are visible.\" Molo turned from the eyepiece of his\nelectro-telescope. \"Do you want to see them, Gregg Haljan?\"\n\nWe were in the forward control and observation turret of the\n_Star-Streak_, Molo and his sister Meka, Venza, Anita and myself.\nUnobtrusively squatting on the floor was a small, gray, rat-faced\nfellow, put there, weapon in hand, to watch us. He was a ruffian from\nthe underworld of Grebhar, a member of the _Star-Streak's_ pirate\ncrew.\n\nWe were some ten hours out from Wandl. A group of four of the globular\nWandl ships were with us, strung in a line some ten thousand miles to\nour left. We had been heading diagonally toward Mars. Some fifteen\nother Wandl vessels were ahead and others following.\n\nWe were no more than fifteen million miles from Mars when Molo sighted\nthe allied ships. \"Will you observe them, Gregg Haljan?\"\n\nI moved to take his place at the 'scope-grid, with the gaze of Anita\nand Venza upon me. They sat huddled together on a low bench against\nthe back curve of the circular turret.\n\nIt was dim here, with little spots of instrument lights, and the\nradiance coming in the glassite plates of the encircling dome. The\nloss of Snap had put a grim look upon the girls. They were dispirited,\ndocile with Meka. They had hardly had a word with me. I think that all\nof us had about given up hope during those hours. Molo had consulted\nme several times with his policies of navigation.\n\nBut I saw no chance to trick him. He was indeed, far more experienced\nthan I, and more skillful, in celestial mechanics. I worked with him.\nI learned the operation and the handling of the _Star-Streak_, which\nwas not greatly different from the _Cometara_ or the _Planetara_.\n\nPoor Snap! He and I had planned to capture and navigate this\n_Star-Streak_. We could have handled her. There were, I gathered, some\nfifteen men aboard her now, but no more than two or three were engaged\nat the navigating mechanisms. Even they could be dispensed with at\ntimes, for the ship's controls were all automatic, handled directly\nfrom the forward turret.\n\nI learned too, something, though not much, of the _Star-Streak's_\nweapons. They were similar to those of the allied ships, since Molo in\nequipping his pirate craft had seized upon all the best he could find\nof the three worlds.\n\nThe _Star-Streak_, during this flight toward Mars, was in close\ncommunication with the Wandl craft. There was a giant vessel, the Wor,\noff to our left now. It carried the brain master in command of the\nWandl forces. Molo took his orders from the Wor, but since his\nequipment and his weapons were so wholly different, the _Star-Streak_\nwas set apart.\n\n\"I can do what I like,\" Molo told me. \"With my own judgement I can\nact; you shall see.\"\n\n\"You've had plenty of experience, Molo.\"\n\n\"Have I not! The terror of the starways, your world called me.\" He\nchuckled vaingloriously. \"I must justify it now.\"\n\n\"Act, do not talk,\" Meka commented sourly. \"Children with toys make\nspeeches like that, and then the toys get broken.\"\n\n\"Fear not, sister. Never again will the _Star-Streak_ come to grief.\"\n\nAnd now I gazed through the 'scope at the waiting allied ships. They\nwere lying some eight million miles off Mars. I gazed and saw the\npoised little group. There were perhaps fifty of them. The majority\nwere Martian, long, low and very sharp-ended, and dull red in color.\nThe wider Earth and Venus ships were silvery and drab. I could\ndistinguish the several different types of craft in this hastily\nassembled fleet: many converted commercials like my ill-starred\n_Cometara_; a few rakish police ships; and about a dozen of the long,\nnarrow supermodern warships. It was their first voyage into battle.\nThey had only been built these past few years, by peaceful governments\nthat protested there never again would be another war!\n\nThe little fleet was lying waiting for us. It was being augmented by\noccasional other ships from Mars. They saw us coming now. The radiance\nof a Benson curve-light enveloped them, with a shaft toward us. The\nimage of them shifted over a million miles to one side.\n\nMolo laughed when he saw it. \"Protecting themselves already! But we\nare not going to attack them there.\"\n\nThe first tactics of the Wandl commanders surprised me. We swung away\nfrom the course to Mars and headed diagonally toward Earth and Venus.\nEarth was the nearer to us, with Venus some forty million miles beyond\nher. For hours we turned in that sweeping curve. Then with our Wandl\nconvoy following, we headed for Earth. I could not help admiring the\nway the _Star-Streak_ was handled. She turned more sharply than the\nWandl craft; and before our next meal, we were leading them all.\n\nWould the allied ships follow us? It was immediately apparent they\nwere coming; but from their poised position, hours of attaining\nvelocity would be needed. The other allied vessels approaching from\nVenus and Earth checked their flight and turned after us. We passed\nwithin five or six hundred thousand miles of several of them.\n\nI found now that some twenty other Wandl ships, leaving Wandl after\nus, had headed directly for Earth. We were all together presently, the\n_Star-Streak_ and nearly fifty Wandl ships, gathered close to one side\nof the Moon. The allies, about a hundred of them, were strung through\nspace, scattered, with varying velocities and flight direction, but\nmost of them endeavoring to get between the Moon and Earth.\n\nThis was the day! I call it that: a routine of meals which Meka grimly\nserved us in the turret, and a little sleep when she took the girls\nbelow and I lay on the turret floor. I wondered who was in command of\nthis allied force, and did not learn until afterward that it was\nGrantline. The _Cometara_ had fallen upon the Moon Apennines, not very\nfar from where my old _Planetara_ still lay, near the base of\nArchimedes. But Grantline and a few of his companions, with their\npowered suits, had struggled free from the gravity pull of the\nwreckage; and a few hours later, a ship out from Earth picked them\nup.\n\nGrantline, on one of the Earth police ships, commanded the fleet now,\nand he afterward told me in detail how he endeavored to conduct his\nforces in the battle, thus enabling me to describe it from both\nviewpoints. He had been cruising toward Mars when he saw us make the\nturn. He thought a landing upon Earth might be planned and hastened\nall his ships into the area between the Moon and Earth to cut us off.\n\nBut that was what Wandl wanted. The Wandl ships, with the\n_Star-Streak_ among them, made a complete slow circuit of the Moon. It\ntook another day. Molo said very little to me in explanation of the\nWandl tactics, but I could see that the object was to lure Grantline\ninto following. A few of the allied ships did follow us around, but\nnot many. The rest stayed carefully guarding the line between the Moon\nand Earth.\n\nThere had been no encounter yet between the hostile ships. The huge\ndistances involved in the engagement must be kept in mind. The gravity\nrays from the Wandl ships were only a slight disturbing element at\nsuch a long distance; Grantline's Zed-rays and Benson curve-lights\nwere defensive only. For offence, Grantline's electronic guns and\nother weapons were of varying range, but none for such distances as\nthese.\n\nWandl seemed unwilling to begin the battle, and Grantline was cautious\nas well. He did not know what weapons these strange globular vessels\nwould use; his only experience had been our encounter with the\nwhirling discs.\n\nThen, at the end of the second day, came the first clash. The\n_Star-Streak_, and all the Wandl ships, were again clustered on the\nEarth side of the Moon; they were hovering perhaps twenty thousand\nmiles above its surface. Grantline's force was a hundred thousand\nmiles off, toward Earth. One of the Wandl ships came tentatively\nforward, and Grantline sent one of the new-style warships to meet it.\n\nThey encircled each other. Both were cautious, but there was a passing\nwithin fifty miles. The Earth ship fired her bolts. The insulated\nbarrage of the Wandl ship withstood them. There was a shower of ether\nsparks close to the ship, and a reddening of the hull, but nothing\nmore. It seemed that the electro-barrages of the Wandl and allied\nships were very similar in nature, an aura of electro-magnetism,\nenclosing the ship like a curtain fifty feet away, absorbed the\nelectronic stream of the enemy bolt. The Wandl ship flung no bolts;\nshe loosed a score of the whirling discs during the passing. They were\nof varying sizes, but similar to those which cut and wrecked the\n_Cometara_; in this instance, the Grantline ship was able to destroy\neach of them as it came close.\n\nThis was the first encounter. The Earth warship went back to its\nsquadron and the Wandl vessel rejoined its fellows. It had fired no\nbolts. Grantline suspected now what afterward proved to be the fact:\nthese Wandl vessels were not equipped with long-range electronic guns.\nThe Wandl defensive tactics were necessary; they feared a widespread\nencounter. They were hovering in a compact group, covering a five\nhundred mile area, over the Moon surface. Their purpose was not yet\napparent, but Grantline saw now that one of the Wandl ships was\ndropping down and landing on the Moon. It skimmed the Apennines and\nlanded not far from Archimedes.\n\nWhat was that for? Grantline noticed that the lowering,\nclosely-gathered Wandl fleet tried to mask the landing. And their\ngravity-rays, with repulsive force, darted out to impede the Grantline\nvessels should they try to advance.\n\nThis Earthward hemisphere of the Moon was now largely in shadow, but\nGrantline's Zed-ray magnifiers showed the vessel on the Moon.\nApparatus was being unloaded. It seemed, down there on the rocky Moon\nplain in the foothills of the Apennines, that some extensive,\nelaborate base was being prepared.\n\nIt was for this the hovering Wandl fleet was waiting, holding off from\nconflict until this Moon base was ready. When Grantline reached that\nconclusion, he ordered all his vessels forward to a general attack.\n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\nDuring this time, on the _Star-Streak_, as we and the Wandl fleet made\nthat preliminary circuit of the Moon, an incident occurred which\nchanged everything for me. I had noticed several times as we gathered\nin the _Star-Streak's_ forward turret, that Venza and Anita were eying\nme. Their expressions were furtive, but I realized that they were\ntrying to attract my attention.\n\nWe had no opportunity to speak secretly. Molo or Meka, or that\nrat-faced guard, were always too near us; and Molo kept me busy with\ncomputations of our course.\n\nWe rounded the Moon. We gathered with the Wandl fleet some twenty\nthousand miles above the lunar surface, and I watched that ship\ndescend and land. Like Grantline, I wondered what for. Molo gave me no\nhint. I saw, through his 'scope, bloated figures in pressure suits\nunloading mechanisms. They seemed to be placing huge contact-discs in\na circle on the lunar rocks. It was reminiscent of the Wandl gravity\nstation, and the contact-beam which Molo had planted in Great-New\nYork.\n\nThen at last the girls had an opportunity to whisper to me. A swift\nphrase came from Anita. \"Gregg! Snap is alive. Hiding on board.\"\n\nI gasped. Snap alive?\n\n\"Planning to rescue us. You and he can capture the _Star-Streak_!\"\n\n\"Anita! Tell me how.\"\n\n\"No more now! Our room below--he's near it. He spoke to us.\"\n\nNo more. She moved away from me. But it was enough. Snap alive! I\nrecalled that when he fell beside the ship, no one had bothered to go\ndown after the body, and at that time the hull-ports were open.\n\nAfter a time Meka took the girls below. I sat with Molo, gazing down\nat the dark and gloomy surface of the Moon. I had finished the\nmathematical work Molo had given me. My thoughts were with Anita and\nVenza, down in their cabin now with Meka. Perhaps even now Snap was\njoining them.\n\nI hardly heard Molo's low, muttered curses, as he set his lenses for a\nslight alteration of our slow circular course among the Wandl fleet.\n\"That fellow at my gravity-shifts acts like a nitwit. He has them\ndisarranged.\"\n\nIt snapped me to sudden alertness. \"Something wrong, Molo? Nonsense!\"\n\n\"These men of my crew answer my controls too slowly. They should jump\nwhen my signals come.\"\n\nThe plates suddenly shifted normally, but there had been an interval\nof delay. Molo was puzzled and annoyed. My heart pounded as I wondered\nif he would investigate. But he did not.\n\n\"You had better sleep, Haljan. Take advantage now; we shall have\naction presently. Did you figure our emerging curve?\"\n\nI shoved my computations across the table to him. \"There.\"\n\n\"You are quick, Haljan.\"\n\n\"We should emerge from the Moon's shadow in about two hours.\"\n\n\"But I will not hold that course. We're staying close near here with\nthe other vessels, but I want some velocity always. Take your sleep,\nHaljan.\"\n\nI stretched on the narrow floor mattress. The turret was silent.\n\nI was aroused from a doze by Molo's activities in the turret. The\ngirls and Meka were still below. The ever-silent Venusian, squatting\nin the turret corner, still had his gun upon me.\n\nI saw that Grantline's ships, over a wide fan-shaped spread, were\nadvancing.\n\nAnd presently we were engaged in the soundless turmoil of battle. I\ncannot relate more than fragments, things I saw and experienced,\nduring six or more hours of bursting electronic light and puffs of\ndarkness in that spread of battle area within the Moon-shadow. It was\na silent battle of crossing lights, ships a thousand miles apart,\ngathering velocity with great tangential curves; passing each other in\na second; sweeping a thousand miles apart again; turning and coming\nback. A hundred engagements.\n\nThe _Star-Streak_ was very fast, very mobile, and, unlike all the\nother Wandl ships, had the allies' own weapons to use against them. I\nsaw now why they called Molo the terror of the starways!\n\nWe swept into the shadowed battle area. Over all its thousand-mile\nspread were the radiant Wandl gravity-beams, disturbing and impeding\nthe course of Grantline's ships. There was the luminous gleam of\nprojectile rockets, like little comets, soundless, launched by the\nWandl craft, and the radiance of the rocket-streams which all the\nvessels were using now for close maneuvering; the glare of Grantline's\nsearchlight bombs and his white search-beams to disclose the deadly\nwhirling discs which the weapons of his vessel must seek out and\ndestroy. A chaos of silent light, stabbed here and there with\nGrantline's darkness bombs, bombs of limited local range which\nexploded in space and which, for a few minutes duration, absorbed all\nlight-rays, giving a temporary effect of darkness.\n\nAnd then wreckage! Broken, leprous Wandl vessels whose barrage at\nclose range had been smashed by Grantline's guns; torn and littered\nallied ships, struck by the huge exploding comet-projectiles and the\nwhirling discs; airless hulks, and scattered fragments which no longer\nresembled a ship at all but only a hull plate or a torn segment of\ndome. And little drifting blobs, the survivors in pressure suits who\nhad leaped from the wreckage; little blobs ignored, whirled away or\ndrawn forward as by chance the sweeping gravity-beams fell upon them;\ntiny derelicts, floating stormtossed until the Moon's attraction\ncaught and pulled them down, or a whirling disc cut through them, or\nthe distant aura of a bolt shocked them to a merciful death.\n\nIt was a three-dimensional, thousand-mile spread of fantasy infernal.\nOut of it, after an hour or two, a steady sift of every manner of\nwreckage was drifting down upon the Moon. The scene began to blur. A\nhaze like glowing star-dust, or the radiance from a comet's tail, was\nspreading a weirdly luminous mist, blurring, obscuring the scene. This\nwas the released electrons and the dissipating gases of the space guns\nand exploding projectiles, forming dust which glowed in the mingled\nstarlight and Earthlight.\n\nThe _Star-Streak_ had plunged, during those six or eight hours,\nthrough the battle area. Our several encounters were all characterized\nby the _Star-Streak's_ extreme flexibility, her speed, mobility, and\nMolo's reckless skill. We came through unscathed. There is a certain\nadvantage for the man who seems not to care for his own life. But\nthere was an encounter, the last one as it chanced, just before we\nemerged downward out of the fog and found ourselves no more than a\nthousand miles above the Moon's surface, where our adversary was\nequally reckless and only Molo's skill saved us.\n\nWe came upon a Venus police ship. We plunged, as though seeking a\ncollision, and the Venus ship was willing. For a moment of chaos, both\nbarrages held against the exchange of bolts. Then we rolled over and\ntilted down from the impulse of the stern rockets. The passing must\nhave been within feet, not miles; and in that second, Molo timed a\nshot to strike at the enemy bottom. It went through their barrage.\nBehind us, a second later, there was only strewn wreckage of the ship,\nso finely powdered that it became a silvery radiance, like moonlight\nshining on a little patch of fog.\n\n\"Not too bad?\" Molo gazed around for appreciation. \"Not bad, Gregg\nHaljan? Molo is not too unskillful?\"\n\nWe hung now close above the Moon's surface, with the battle area over\nus. Out of the fog up there came the drifting wreckage; and now the\nWandl ships were coming down, one by one. Not so many of them now; no\nmore than ten of them emerged.\n\nGrantline did not follow. His ships withdrew the other way. The fog\ngradually dispersed. Grantline could now take stock of the battle; he\nhad been victorious. One might call it that, since his percentage of\nstrength, numerically, was greater now than when the battle began. Ten\nremaining Wandl ships, and the allies had about twenty-five.\n\nAnother hour passed. Grantline's twenty-five ships were gathered in a\nclose group, ten thousand miles above the Moon's surface. Under them,\nthe ten Wandl vessels and the _Star-Streak_ seemed ranging in a five\nhundred mile circle. Down through it, on the rocks of the Moon in the\nfoothills of the Apennines, the mechanism established there abruptly\nsprang into action.\n\nIt was a giant gravity-beam. Of infinitely greater power than any\nWandl vessel could generate, it flung out its spreading, conical ray.\n\nSo this had been the purpose of all the Wandl tactics, to manipulate\nGrantline into his present position. This gravity-beam, though far\nsmaller, was comparable to the one used by the Wandl control station.\nA rock contact against a huge mass, Wandl, and here, the Moon were\nnecessary to give the ray its power. No ship could generate such a\nray, so the Wandlites chose this battleground where they could\nestablish themselves upon our deserted Moon.\n\nThe beam had about a hundred foot diameter at its base on the rocks;\nit passed upward through the circle of Wandl vessels and its spread\nbathed all of Grantline's ships at once. An attractive beam, so\npowerful that the ships were helpless; against all their efforts they\nwere pinned and drawn downward. A slight velocity at first, but with a\ntremendous acceleration.\n\nWithin an hour they were hurtling, coming together as they speeded\ndown the narrowing cone of the beam. The ten thousand miles, their\ndistance above the Moon, was cut to five thousand. The Wandl ships\ndrew aside, keeping well out of range to let them pass; in another\nthirty minutes they would crash against the rocks.\n\nI gazed in horror from the _Star-Streak's_ turret. We were sidewise to\nthe angle of the beam. Grantline's ships were pulled together now into\nalmost a fifty-mile group. They hung all askew, helplessly pinned,\nsome broadside, some upended. The movement of their fall was so rapid\nthat even with the naked eye it was apparent.\n\n\"Got them now,\" Molo chuckled. \"This is the end for them, Gregg\nHaljan.\"\n\nThere were only three of us in the turret: Molo and I, and my\nwatchful, silent guard who sat cross-legged, with a ray-gun pointed at\nme.\n\nMeka and the two girls were below during all the engagement.\n\nIt was over now.\n\nDuring this lull Molo had sent the men from the deck gun ports to\ntheir hull quarters. Our decks were empty now; the bridges and\ncatwalks up here had momentarily no occupants. The _Star-Streak_ had\nlittle velocity, only a slow drift downward toward the Moon's surface,\nwhich now was only a few hundred miles beneath us.\n\nThe lunar disc was a great dark spread of desolation, with only the\nsunlight topping the distant horizon limb. And from under us, to the\nside, was the source of the giant gravity-beam. Over us were the\nwatch-Wandl vessels, and, still higher, the helpless knot of\nGrantline's ships hurtling down.\n\n\"Got them now,\" Molo repeated. \"In another....\"\n\nHe never finished. From the open doorway of the turret a figure rose\nup. Snap! His aspect, even more than his appearance, transfixed me.\nSnap, with his clothes torn; grimy and spattered with blood; his face\npale and gaunt, with hollow, blazing eyes. And above it, the shock of\nrumpled red hair. In one hand he clutched a ray-gun, and in the other\na blood-stained knife!\n\nMy guard squatting on the floor, half-turned. Snap's bolt met him\nbefore he could raise his weapon. He tumbled dead almost at my feet.\nAnd mingled with the hiss of the bolt was Snap's shout at the unarmed\nMolo.\n\n\"Into the corner, you! Back up, you damned traitor, else I'll kill you\nas I've killed everyone else on this ship!\"\n\n\n\n\n19\n\n\nI had leaped and seized the gun which was still in the hand of the\ndead guard. \"Snap, the girls!\"\n\n\"Down below. Free. They've got Meka bound and gagged, locked and\nsealed in a bunk-room. You bring them up! I'll hold this accursed\ntraitor. No need to kill him. By the gods, I've killed enough!\"\n\nHe saw for the first time the vast silent drama in the firmament\noutside the dome windows. \"Gregg, for the love of....\"\n\n\"No time now, Snap! I'll get the girls.\"\n\n\"Watch out. I might have missed somebody down below.\"\n\nHe had. Three men appeared on the forward deck near the foot of our\nturret ladder. My bolt spat down upon them; two of them fell. The\nother ran aft, toward where I saw Venza and Anita appearing from the\nlounge doorway of the cabin superstructure. I fired again, and the\nrunning man tumbled forward on his face. He was the last of the pirate\ncrew.\n\nMolo was crouching, half-bending forward over his instrument table,\nwith Snap's gun upon him. The girls burst upon us. We armed them. Meka\nwas safely fastened down below. We backed Molo to the floor in the\ncorner, with Venza and Anita watching him.\n\nSnap and I were in control of the ship. For temporary periods the\nautomatics would handle the gravity-shifters. I could operate them\nhere from the turret. We had a downward velocity toward the Moon. Five\nhundred miles below us, no more, was the base of that diabolical\ngravity-ray which was so swiftly pulling the twenty-five Grantline\nships to their destruction.\n\nI gripped Snap and told him what we must do. \"The forward gun on the\nstarboard side is almost identical with our Earth guns, the Francine\nprojectors. With a short range you can handle it and I'll give you a\nclose mark!\"\n\nHe dashed for the deck. I set the levers. Gravity-plates with full bow\nattraction. Stern repulsion to the Earth and the stern rocket-streams\nat highest power.\n\nThe _Star-Streak_ responded smoothly; with acceleration such as only\nMolo's famous terror of the starways could attain, we dove for the\nMoon.\n\nBreathless minutes! Those Wandl ships up in the firmament behind our\nstern would probably do nothing; they would not understand this sudden\nmove of their friendly ship. The brain masters, the insect-like\nWandlites down on the Moon rocks operating the mechanism of the\ngravity-ray, would not suspect until too late what the _Star-Streak_\nwas doing.\n\nUprushing rocks, the Apennines to one side; the dark yawning maw of\nArchimedes on the other. We were diving parallel with the gravity-ray\nnow, hardly a mile from it, diving for the mechanisms of its source.\nTwenty thousand feet of altitude. I bent our rocket-streams up for the\nstart of our turning. Bow-hull gravity-plates next. Ten thousand feet.\nFive thousand.\n\nHow close we went I never knew. It was seconds now, not minutes. I\nshifted all the controls. Our bow lifted as we straightened. The whole\nspreading lunar surface tilted and dipped. Snap fired. I saw the bolt\nflash at the tilting landscape and a puff of light down there on the\nrocks. And an instant later there were vacant rocks where the little\ncluster of men and mechanisms had been. And the upflung gravity-beam\nwas gone!\n\nThe giant towering cliffs of the mountain of Archimedes seemed to rush\nat our upturning bow. The great dark crater-mouth slid under our hull.\nBut we cleared it; the maw of blackness slid down and away; the whole\nlunar world tilted down and dwindled as we mounted again into the\nstarlight.\n\nMinutes passed while we mounted. Above our upstanding bow was a new\ndrama. The suddenly-released Grantline ships, almost level with the\nten Wandl vessels when the ray vanished, turned sidewise. The poised\nWandl craft, devoid of velocity, could not pick up the ray to\nescape now. Grantline, for those minutes, ignored the frantically\nflung discs; it was a desperate encounter, all at close quarters. We\nsaw the spitting, puffing lights and the silent turmoil, hidden\npresently by the spreading clouds of luminous fog.\n\nThen out of it came drifting the wreckage. We plunged through an end\nof the glowing fog, encountered nothing but two triumphant Venus\nvessels. With them we mounted into the upper starlight.\n\nThis was the end of the battle. The victorious Grantline ships one by\none came lunging up: only twelve of them now. No Wandl vessels were\nleft.\n\nThe great spreading cloud drifted down like a shroud to hide the\nwreckage, drifted and settled to the lunar surface, a great, radiant\narea of fog, gleaming in the Earthlight.\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\nThere is very little more, pertinent to this narrative, that I need\nadd of the events on Earth, Venus, and Mars during this momentous\nsummer. The main facts are history now: the wild storms, the damage\ndone by outraged nature and the panic among the people--all of it has\nbeen detailed as public news. The strange light-beams planted by Wandl\nin Greater New York, Grebhar, and Ferrok-Shahn have not yet burned\nthemselves away. But they are lessening and scientists say that they\nwill soon be gone.\n\nThe changed calendars call this the New Era. The axis of each of the\nthree worlds was not appreciably altered; the climates are at last\nrestoring to normal. But the axial rotations of all three planets were\nslowed by that attacking Wandl beam before we wrecked the gravity\nstation. The Earth day has been lengthened, resulting in the new\ncalendar, the New Era. Our year, formerly of approximately 365-1/4\ndays, now contains, but 358.7 days.\n\nMolo and Meka have been returned to Ferrok-Shahn. They were tried\nthere for piracy and treason and are imprisoned.\n\nAnd Wandl? With her gravity-controls wrecked, Wandl became subject to\nthe balancing celestial forces. During those succeeding months of the\nsummer and autumn no other spaceships appeared from her: nor did our\nworld investigate. Her presence here, even a little world one-sixth\nthe size of the Moon, was causing disturbance enough!\n\nWandl moved with slow velocity, like a dallying, strangely sluggish\ncomet about to round our Sun. What would her final orbit be? By\nfortunate chance she headed in, far from the Earth and Venus; missed\nMercury by a wide margin; went close around the Sun: came out again.\n\nBut the pull of the Sun, and Mercury dragged her back. Her velocity\nwas not great enough.\n\nI recall that late autumn afternoon when, with Anita, Snap, and Venza,\nI sat in the observatory near Washington, gazing at Wandl through the\ndark glass of the solar-scope. Doomed invader! She showed now as a\ntiny dark dot over the Sun's giant, blazing surface. This was her\nfinal plunge. The dot was presently swallowed and gone. It seemed,\namid those giant, licking streamers of blazing gas, that there was an\nextra puff of light.\n\nAnd some claim now that for a brief time our sunlight was a trifle\nwarmer, a little pyre to mark the end of Wandl, the Invader.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nA CLASSIC NOVEL OF INTERPLANETARY WARFARE\n\nThere were nine major planets in the Solar System and it was within\ntheir boundaries that man first set up interplanetary commerce and\nbegan trading with the ancient Martian civilization. And then they\ndiscovered a tenth planet--a maverick!\n\nThis tenth world, if it had an orbit, had a strange one, for it was\nheading inwards from interstellar space, heading close to the\nEarth-Mars spaceways, upsetting astronautic calculations and raising\nturmoil on the two inhabited worlds.\n\nBut even so none suspected then just how much trouble this new world\nwould make. For it was WANDL THE INVADER and it was no barren\nplanetoid. It was a manned world, manned by minds and monsters and\ntraveling into our system with a purpose beyond that of astronomical\naccident!\n\nIt's a terrific novel from the classic days of great science-fiction\nadventure--now first published in book form. When RAY CUMMINGS took\nleave of this planet early in 1957, the world of modern\nscience-fiction lost one of its genuine founding fathers. For the\nimagination of this talented writer supplied a great many of the most\nbasic themes upon which the present superstructure of science-fiction\nis based. Following the lead of Jules Verne and H. G. Wells, Cummings\nsuccessfully bridged the gap between the early dawning of\nscience-fiction in the last decades of the Nineteenth Century and the\nfull flowering of the field in these middle decades of the Twentieth.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBorn in 1887, Cummings acquired insight into the vast possibilities of\nfuture science by a personal association with Thomas Alva Edison.\nDuring the 1920's and 1930's, he thrilled millions of readers with his\nvivid tales of space and time. The infinite and the infinitesimal were\nall parts of his canvas, and past, present, and future, the\ninterplanetary and the extra-dimensional, all made their initial\nimpact on the reading public through his many stories and novels.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nHere's a quick checklist of recent releases of\n\nACE SCIENCE-FICTION BOOKS\n\nD-449  THE GENETIC GENERAL by Gordon R.

To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
