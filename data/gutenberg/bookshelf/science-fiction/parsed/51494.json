He fell headlong into a patch of blue moss and whooped with\ndelight in having this day free for exploring. He was free to see the\nocean at last.\n\nWhen he had caught his breath, he looked back through the forest. No\nsign of the village; he had left it far behind. Safe from the scrutiny\nof brothers and parents, there was nothing now to stop him from going\nto the ocean. This was the moment to stop time.\n\n\"On your mark!\" he shouted to the rippling stream and its orange\nwhirlpools. He glanced furtively from side to side, pretending that\nsome object might try to get a head start. \"Get set!\" he challenged\nthe thin-winged bees that hovered over the abundant foliage. \"Stop!\"\nHe shrieked this command upward toward the dense, low-hanging purple\nclouds that perennially raced across the treetops, making one wonder\nhow tall the trees really were.\n\nHis eyes took quick inventory. It was exactly as he knew it would be:\nthe milky-orange stream had become motionless and its minute whirlpools\nhad stopped whirling; a nearby bee hung suspended over a paka plant,\nits transparent wings frozen in position for a downward stroke; and the\nheavy purple fluid overhead held fast in its manufacture of whorls and\nnimbi.\n\nWith everything around him in a state of perfect tableau, Purnie\nhurried toward the ocean.\n\nIf only the days weren't so short! he thought. There was so much to\nsee and so little time. It seemed that everyone except him had seen\nthe wonders of the beach country. The stories he had heard from his\nbrothers and their friends had taunted him for as long as he could\nremember. So many times had he heard these thrilling tales that now,\nas he ran along, he could clearly picture the wonderland as though he\nwere already there. There would be a rockslide of petrified logs to\nplay on, the ocean itself with waves higher than a house, the comical\nthree-legged tripons who never stopped munching on seaweed, and many\nkinds of other wonderful creatures found only at the ocean.\n\nHe bounced through the forest as though the world was reserved this\nday just for him. And who could say it wasn't? he thought. Wasn't this\nhis fifth birthday? He ran along feeling sorry for four-year-olds, and\neven for those who were only four and a half, for they were babies and\nwouldn't dare try slipping away to the ocean alone. But five!\n\n\"I'll set you free, Mr. Bee--just wait and see!\" As he passed one of\nthe many motionless pollen-gathering insects he met on the way, he took\ncare not to brush against it or disturb its interrupted task. When\nPurnie had stopped time, the bees--like all the other creatures he\nmet--had been arrested in their native activities, and he knew that as\nsoon as he resumed time, everything would pick up where it had left off.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen he smelled an acid sweetness that told him the ocean was not far\noff, his pulse quickened in anticipation. Rather than spoil what was\nclearly going to be a perfect day, he chose to ignore the fact that he\nhad been forbidden to use time-stopping as a convenience for journeying\nfar from home. He chose to ignore the oft-repeated statement that an\nhour of time-stopping consumed more energy than a week of foot-racing.\nHe chose to ignore the negative maxim that \"small children who stop\ntime without an adult being present, may not live to regret it.\"\n\nHe chose, instead, to picture the beaming praise of family and friends\nwhen they learned of his brave journey.\n\nThe journey was long, the clock stood still. He stopped long enough to\ngather some fruit that grew along the path. It would serve as his lunch\nduring this day of promise. With it under his arm he bounded along a\ndozen more steps, then stopped abruptly in his tracks.\n\nHe found himself atop a rocky knoll, overlooking the mighty sea!\n\nHe was so overpowered by the vista before him that his \"Hurrah!\" came\nout as a weak squeak. The ocean lay at the ready, its stilled waves\nawaiting his command to resume their tidal sweep. The breakers along\nthe shoreline hung in varying stages of disarray, some having already\nexploded into towering white spray while others were poised in smooth\norange curls waiting to start that action.\n\nAnd there were new friends everywhere! Overhead, a flock of spora were\nfrozen in a steep glide, preparatory to a beach landing. Purnie had\nheard of these playful creatures many times. Today, with his brothers\nin school, he would have the pets all to himself. Further down the\nbeach was a pair of two-legged animals poised in mid-step, facing\nthe spot where Purnie now stood. Some distance behind them were eight\nmore, each of whom were motionless in a curious pose of interrupted\nanimation. And down in the water, where the ocean ran itself into thin\nnothingness upon the sand, he saw standing here and there the comical\ntripons, those three-legged marine buffoons who made handsome careers\nof munching seaweed.\n\n\"Hi there!\" Purnie called. When he got no reaction, he remembered that\nhe himself was \"dead\" to the living world: he was still in a zone of\ntime-stopping, on the inside looking out. For him, the world would\ncontinue to be a tableau of mannikins until he resumed time.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Hi there!\" he called again; but now his mental attitude was that he\nexpected time to resume. It did! Immediately he was surrounded by\nactivity. He heard the roar of the crashing orange breakers, he tasted\nthe dew of acid that floated from the spray, and he saw his new friends\ncontinue the actions which he had stopped while back in the forest.\n\nHe knew, too, that at this moment, in the forest, the little brook\npicked up its flow where it had left off, the purple clouds resumed\ntheir leeward journey up the valley, and the bees continued their\npollen-gathering without having missed a single stroke of their\ndelicate wings. The brook, the clouds, and the insects had not been\ninterrupted in the least; their respective tasks had been performed\nwith continuing sureness. It was time itself that Purnie had stopped,\nnot the world around him.\n\nHe scampered around the rockpile and down the sandy cliff to meet the\ntripons who, to him, had just come to life.\n\n\"I can stand on my head!\" He set down his lunch and balanced himself\nbottoms-up while his legs pawed the air in an effort to hold him in\nposition. He knew it was probably the worst head-stand he had ever\ndone, for he felt weak and dizzy. Already time-stopping had left its\nmark on his strength. But his spirits ran on unchecked.\n\nThe tripon thought Purnie's feat was superb. It stopped munching long\nenough to give him a salutory wag of its rump before returning to its\nrepast.\n\nPurnie ran from pillar to post, trying to see and do everything at\nonce. He looked around to greet the flock of spora, but they had glided\nto a spot further along the shore. Then, bouncing up to the first of\nthe two-legged animals, he started to burst forth with his habitual \"Hi\nthere!\" when he heard them making sounds of their own.\n\n\"... will be no limit to my operations now, Benson. This planet makes\nseventeen. Seventeen planets I can claim as my own!\"\n\n\"My, my. Seventeen planets. And tell me, Forbes, just what the hell are\nyou going to do with them--mount them on the wall of your den back in\nSan Diego?\"\n\n\"Hi there, wanna play?\" Purnie's invitation got nothing more than\nstartled glance from the animals who quickly returned to their chatter.\nHe scampered up the beach, picked up his lunch, and ran back to them,\ntagging along at their heels. \"I've got my lunch, want some?\"\n\n\"Benson, you'd better tell your men back there to stop gawking at\nthe scenery and get to work. Time is money. I didn't pay for this\nexpedition just to give your flunkies a vacation.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe animals stopped so suddenly that Purnie nearly tangled himself in\ntheir heels.\n\n\"All right, Forbes, just hold it a minute. Listen to me. Sure, it's\nyour money that put us here; it's your expedition all the way. But you\nhired me to get you here with the best crew on earth, and that's just\nwhat I've done. My job isn't over yet. I'm responsible for the safety\nof the men while we're here, and for the safe trip home.\"\n\n\"Precisely. And since you're responsible, get 'em working. Tell 'em to\nbring along the flag. Look at the damn fools back there, playing in the\nocean with a three-legged ostrich!\"\n\n\"Good God, man, aren't you human? We've only been on this planet twenty\nminutes! Naturally they want to look around. They half expected to find\nwild animals or worse, and here we are surrounded by quaint little\ncreatures that run up to us like we're long-lost brothers. Let the men\nlook around a minute or two before we stake out your claim.\"\n\n\"Bah! Bunch of damn children.\"\n\nAs Purnie followed along, a leg shot out at him and missed. \"Benson,\nwill you get this bug-eyed kangaroo away from me!\" Purnie shrieked with\njoy at this new frolic and promptly stood on his head. In this position\nhe got an upside down view of them walking away.\n\nHe gave up trying to stay with them. Why did they move so fast, anyway?\nWhat was the hurry? As he sat down and began eating his lunch, three\nmore of the creatures came along making excited noises, apparently\ntrying to catch up to the first two. As they passed him, he held out\nhis lunch. \"Want some?\" No response.\n\nPlaying held more promise than eating. He left his lunch half eaten and\nwent down to where they had stopped further along the beach.\n\n\"Captain Benson, sir! Miles has detected strong radiation in the\nvicinity. He's trying to locate it now.\"\n\n\"There you are, Forbes. Your new piece of real estate is going to make\nyou so rich that you can buy your next planet. That'll make eighteen, I\nbelieve.\"\n\n\"Radiation, bah! We've found low-grade ore on every planet I've\ndiscovered so far, and this one'll be no different. Now how about that\nflag? Let's get it up, Benson. And the cornerstone, and the plaque.\"\n\n\"All right, lads. The sooner we get Mr. Forbes's pennant raised and his\nclaim staked out, the sooner we can take time to look around. Lively\nnow!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen the three animals went back to join the rest of their group, the\nfirst two resumed walking. Purnie followed along.\n\n\"Well, Benson, you won't have to look far for materials to use for the\nbase of the flag pole. Look at that rockpile up there.\n\n\"Can't use them. They're petrified logs. The ones on top are too high\nto carry down, and if we move those on the bottom, the whole works will\nslide down on top of us.\"\n\n\"Well--that's your problem. Just remember, I want this flag pole to be\nsolid. It's got to stand at least--\"\n\n\"Don't worry, Forbes, we'll get your monument erected. What's this with\nthe flag? There must be more to staking a claim than just putting up a\nflag.\"\n\n\"There is, there is. Much more. I've taken care of all requirements set\ndown by law to make my claim. But the flag? Well, you might say it\nrepresents an empire, Benson. The Forbes Empire. On each of my flags\nis the word FORBES, a symbol of development and progress. Call it\nsentiment if you will.\"\n\n\"Don't worry, I won't. I've seen real-estate flags before.\"\n\n\"Damn it all, will you stop referring to this as a real-estate deal?\nWhat I'm doing is big, man. Big! This is pioneering.\"\n\n\"Of course. And if I'm not mistaken, you've set up a neat little escrow\nsystem so that you not only own the planets, but you will virtually own\nthe people who are foolish enough to buy land on them.\"\n\n\"I could have your hide for talking to me like this. Damn you, man!\nIt's people like me who pay your way. It's people like me who give your\nspace ships some place to go. It's people like me who pour good money\ninto a chancey job like this, so that people like you can get away from\nthirteen-story tenement houses. Did you ever think of that?\"\n\n\"I imagine you'll triple your money in six months.\"\n\nWhen they stopped, Purnie stopped. At first he had been interested in\nthe strange sounds they were making, but as he grew used to them, and\nas they in turn ignored his presence, he hopped alongside chattering to\nhimself, content to be in their company.\n\nHe heard more of these sounds coming from behind, and he turned to see\nthe remainder of the group running toward them.\n\n\"Captain Benson! Here's the flag, sir. And here's Miles with the\nscintillometer. He says the radiation's getting stronger over this way!\"\n\n\"How about that, Miles?\"\n\n\"This thing's going wild, Captain. It's almost off scale.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPurnie saw one of the animals hovering around him with a little box.\nThankful for the attention, he stood on his head. \"Can you do this?\"\nHe was overjoyed at the reaction. They all started making wonderful\nnoises, and he felt most satisfied.\n\n\"Stand back, Captain! Here's the source right here! This little\nchuck-walla's hotter than a plutonium pile!\"\n\n\"Let me see that, Miles. Well, I'll be damned! Now what do you\nsuppose--\"\n\nBy now they had formed a widening circle around him, and he was hard\nput to think of an encore. He gambled on trying a brand new trick: he\nstood on one leg.\n\n\"Benson, I must have that animal! Put him in a box.\"\n\n\"Now wait a minute, Forbes. Universal Law forbids--\"\n\n\"This is my planet and I am the law. Put him in a box!\"\n\n\"With my crew as witness, I officially protest--\"\n\n\"Good God, what a specimen to take back. Radio-active animals! Why,\nthey can reproduce themselves, of course! There must be thousands of\nthese creatures around here someplace. And to think of those damn fools\non Earth with their plutonium piles! Hah! Now I'll have investors\n_flocking_ to me. How about it, Benson--does pioneering pay off or\ndoesn't it?\"\n\n\"Not so fast. Since this little fellow is radioactive, there may be\ngreat danger to the crew--\"\n\n\"Now look here! You had planned to put _mineral_ specimens in a lead\nbox, so what's the difference? Put him in a box.\"\n\n\"He'll die.\"\n\n\"I have you under contract, Benson! You are responsible to me, and\nwhat's more, you are on my property. Put him in a box.\"\n\nPurnie was tired. First the time-stopping, then this. While this day\nhad brought more fun and excitement than he could have hoped for,\nthe strain was beginning to tell. He lay in the center of the circle\nhappily exhausted, hoping that his friends would show him some of their\nown tricks.\n\nHe didn't have to wait long. The animals forming the circle stepped\nback and made way for two others who came through carrying a box.\nPurnie sat up to watch the show.\n\n\"Hell, Captain, why don't I just pick him up? Looks like he has no\nintention of running away.\"\n\n\"Better not, Cabot. Even though you're shielded, no telling what\npowers the little fella has. Play it safe and use the rope.\"\n\n\"I swear he knows what we're saying. Look at those eyes.\"\n\n\"All right, careful now with that line.\"\n\n\"Come on, baby. Here you go. That's a boy!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPurnie took in these sounds with perplexed concern. He sensed the\nimploring quality of the creature with the rope, but he didn't know\nwhat he was supposed to do. He cocked his head to one side as he\nwiggled in anticipation.\n\nHe saw the noose spinning down toward his head, and, before he knew\nit, he had scooted out of the circle and up the sandy beach. He was\nsurprised at himself for running away. Why had he done it? He wondered.\nNever before had he felt this fleeting twinge that made him want to\nprotect himself.\n\nHe watched the animals huddle around the box on the beach, their\nattention apparently diverted to something else. He wished now that he\nhad not run away; he felt he had lost his chance to join in their fun.\n\n\"Wait!\" He ran over to his half-eaten lunch, picked it up, and ran back\ninto the little crowd. \"I've got my lunch, want some?\"\n\nThe party came to life once more. His friends ran this way and that,\nand at last Purnie knew that the idea was to get him into the box.\nHe picked up the spirit of the tease, and deliberately ran within a\nfew feet of the lead box, then, just as the nearest pursuer was about\nto push him in, he sidestepped onto safer ground. Then he heard a\ndeafening roar and felt a warm, wet sting in one of his legs.\n\n\"Forbes, you fool! Put away that gun!\"\n\n\"There you are, boys. It's all in knowing how. Just winged him, that's\nall. Now pick him up.\"\n\nThe pang in his leg was nothing: Purnie's misery lay in his confusion.\nWhat had he done wrong? When he saw the noose spinning toward him\nagain, he involuntarily stopped time. He knew better than to use this\npower carelessly, but his action now was reflex. In that split second\nfollowing the sharp sting in his leg, his mind had grasped in all\ndirections to find an acceptable course of action. Finding none, it had\nordered the stoppage of time.\n\nThe scene around him became a tableau once more. The noose hung\nmotionless over his head while the rest of the rope snaked its way in\ntransverse waves back to one of the two-legged animals. Purnie dragged\nhimself through the congregation, whimpering from his inability to\nunderstand.\n\nAs he worked his way past one creature after another, he tried at first\nto not look them in the eye, for he felt sure he had done something\nwrong. Then he thought that by sneaking a glance at them as he passed,\nhe might see a sign pointing to their purpose. He limped by one who had\nin his hand a small shiny object that had been emitting smoke from one\nend; the smoke now billowed in lifeless curls about the animal's head.\nHe hobbled by another who held a small box that had previously made a\nhissing sound whenever Purnie was near. These things told him nothing.\nBefore starting his climb up the knoll, he passed a tripon which, true\nto its reputation, was comical even in fright. Startled by the loud\nexplosion, it had jumped four feet into the air before Purnie had\nstopped time. Now it hung there, its beak stuffed with seaweed and its\nthree legs drawn up into a squatting position.\n\nLeaving the assorted statues behind, he limped his way up the knoll,\ntorn between leaving and staying. What an odd place, this ocean\ncountry! He wondered why he had not heard more detail about the beach\nanimals.\n\nReaching the top of the bluff, he looked down upon his silent friends\nwith a feeling of deep sorrow. How he wished he were down there playing\nwith them. But he knew at last that theirs was a game he didn't fit\ninto. Now there was nothing left but to resume time and start the\nlong walk home. Even though the short day was nearly over, he knew he\ndidn't dare use time-stopping to get himself home in nothing flat. His\nfatigued body and clouded mind were strong signals that he had already\nabused this faculty.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen Purnie started time again, the animal with the noose stood in\nopen-mouthed disbelief as the rope fell harmlessly to the sand--on the\nspot where Purnie had been standing.\n\n\"My God, he's--he's gone.\"\n\nThen another of the animals, the one with the smoking thing in his\nhand, ran a few steps toward the noose, stopped and gaped at the rope.\n\"All right, you people, what's going on here? Get him in that box. What\ndid you do with him?\"\n\nThe resumption of time meant nothing at all to those on the beach, for\nto them time had never stopped. The only thing they could be sure of\nwas that at one moment there had been a fuzzy creature hopping around\nin front of them, and the next moment he was gone.\n\n\"Is he invisible, Captain? Where is he?\"\n\n\"Up there, Captain! On those rocks. Isn't that him?\"\n\n\"Well, I'll be damned!\"\n\n\"Benson, I'm holding you personally responsible for this! Now that\nyou've botched it up, I'll bring him down my own way.\"\n\n\"Just a minute, Forbes, let me think. There's something about that\nfuzzy little devil that we should.... Forbes! I warned you about that\ngun!\"\n\nPurnie moved across the top of the rockpile for a last look at his\nfriends. His weight on the end of the first log started the slide.\nSlowly at first, the giant pencils began cascading down the short\ndistance to the sand. Purnie fell back onto solid ground, horrified at\nthe spectacle before him. The agonizing screams of the animals below\nfilled him with hysteria.\n\nThe boulders caught most of them as they stood ankle-deep in the surf.\nOthers were pinned down on the sand.\n\n\"I didn't mean it!\" Purnie screamed. \"I'm sorry! Can't you hear?\" He\nhopped back and forth near the edge of the rise, torn with panic and\nshame. \"Get up! Please get up!\" He was horrified by the moans reaching\nhis ears from the beach. \"You're getting all wet! Did you hear me?\nPlease get up.\" He was choked with rage and sorrow. How could he have\ndone this? He wanted his friends to get up and shake themselves off,\ntell him it was all right. But it was beyond his power to bring it\nabout.\n\nThe lapping tide threatened to cover those in the orange surf.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPurnie worked his way down the hill, imploring them to save themselves.\nThe sounds they made carried a new tone, a desperate foreboding of\ndeath.\n\n\"Rhodes! Cabot! Can you hear me?\"\n\n\"I--I can't move, Captain. My leg, it's.... My God, we're going to\ndrown!\"\n\n\"Look around you, Cabot. Can you see anyone moving?\"\n\n\"The men on the beach are nearly buried, Captain. And the rest of us\nhere in the water--\"\n\n\"Forbes. Can you see Forbes? Maybe he's--\" His sounds were cut off by a\nwavelet gently rolling over his head.\n\nPurnie could wait no longer. The tides were all but covering one of the\nanimals, and soon the others would be in the same plight. Disregarding\nthe consequences, he ordered time to stop.\n\nWading down into the surf, he worked a log off one victim, then he\ntugged the animal up to the sand. Through blinding tears, Purnie worked\nslowly and carefully. He knew there was no hurry--at least, not as far\nas his friends' safety was concerned. No matter what their condition\nof life or death was at this moment, it would stay the same way until\nhe started time again. He made his way deeper into the orange liquid,\nwhere a raised hand signalled the location of a submerged body. The\nhand was clutching a large white banner that was tangled among the\nlogs. Purnie worked the animal free and pulled it ashore.\n\nIt was the one who had been carrying the shiny object that spit smoke.\n\nScarcely noticing his own injured leg, he ferried one victim after\nanother until there were no more in the surf. Up on the beach, he\nstarted unraveling the logs that pinned down the animals caught there.\nHe removed a log from the lap of one, who then remained in a sitting\nposition, his face contorted into a frozen mask of agony and shock.\nAnother, with the weight removed, rolled over like an iron statue into\na new position. Purnie whimpered in black misery as he surveyed the\nchaotic scene before him.\n\nAt last he could do no more; he felt consciousness slipping away from\nhim.\n\nHe instinctively knew that if he lost his senses during a period of\ntime-stopping, events would pick up where they had left off ... without\nhim. For Purnie, this would be death. If he had to lose consciousness,\nhe knew he must first resume time.\n\nStep by step he plodded up the little hill, pausing every now and then\nto consider if this were the moment to start time before it was too\nlate. With his energy fast draining away, he reached the top of the\nknoll, and he turned to look down once more on the group below.\n\nThen he knew how much his mind and body had suffered: when he ordered\ntime to resume, nothing happened.\n\nHis heart sank. He wasn't afraid of death, and he knew that if he died\nthe oceans would roll again and his friends would move about. But he\nwanted to see them safe.\n\nHe tried to clear his mind for supreme effort. There was no _urging_\ntime to start. He knew he couldn't persuade it by bits and pieces,\nfirst slowly then full ahead. Time either progressed or it didn't. He\nhad to take one viewpoint or the other.\n\nThen, without knowing exactly when it happened, his mind took\ncommand....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis friends came to life. The first one he saw stir lay on his stomach\nand pounded his fists on the beach. A flood of relief settled over\nPurnie as sounds came from the animal.\n\n\"What's the matter with me? Somebody tell me! Am I nuts? Miles! Schick!\nWhat's happening?\"\n\n\"I'm coming, Rhodes! Heaven help us, man--I saw it, too. We're either\ncrazy or those damn logs are alive!\"\n\n\"It's not the logs. How about us? How'd we get out of the water? Miles,\nwe're both cracking.\"\n\n\"I'm telling you, man, it's the logs, or rocks or whatever they are.\nI was looking right at them. First they're on top of me, then they're\npiled up over there!\"\n\n\"Damnit, the logs didn't pick us up out of the ocean, did they? Captain\nBenson!\"\n\n\"Are you men all right?\"\n\n\"Yes sir, but--\"\n\n\"Who saw exactly what happened?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid we're not seeing right, Captain. Those logs--\"\n\n\"I know, I know. Now get hold of yourselves. We've got to round up the\nothers and get out of here while time is on our side.\"\n\n\"But what happened, Captain?\"\n\n\"Hell, Rhodes, don't you think I'd like to know? Those logs are so old\nthey're petrified. The whole bunch of us couldn't lift one. It would\ntake super-human energy to move one of those things.\"\n\n\"I haven't seen anything super-human. Those ostriches down there are so\nbusy eating seaweed--\"\n\n\"All right, let's bear a hand here with the others. Some of them can't\nwalk. Where's Forbes?\"\n\n\"He's sitting down there in the water, Captain, crying like a baby. Or\nlaughing. I can't tell which.\"\n\n\"We'll have to get him. Miles, Schick, come along. Forbes! You all\nright?\"\n\n\"Ho-ho-ho! Seventeen! Seventeen! Seventeen planets, Benson, and they'll\ndo anything I say! This one's got a mind of its own. Did you see that\nlittle trick with the rocks? Ho-ho!\"\n\n\"See if you can find his gun, Schick; he'll either kill himself or one\nof us. Tie his hands and take him back to the ship. We'll be along\nshortly.\"\n\n\"Hah-hah-hah! Seventeen! Benson, I'm holding you personally responsible\nfor this. Hee-hee!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPurnie opened his eyes as consciousness returned. Had his friends gone?\n\nHe pulled himself along on his stomach to a position between two rocks,\nwhere he could see without being seen. By the light of the twin moons\nhe saw that they were leaving, marching away in groups of two and\nthree, the weak helping the weaker. As they disappeared around the\ncurving shoreline, the voices of the last two, bringing up the rear far\nbehind the others, fell faintly on his ears over the sound of the surf.\n\n\"Is it possible that we're all crazy, Captain?\"\n\n\"It's possible, but we're not.\"\n\n\"I wish I could be sure.\"\n\n\"See Forbes up ahead there? What do you think of him?\"\n\n\"I still can't believe it.\"\n\n\"He'll never be the same.\"\n\n\"Tell me something. What was the most unusual thing you noticed back\nthere?\"\n\n\"You must be kidding, sir. Why, the way those logs were off of us\nsuddenly--\"\n\n\"Yes, of course. But I mean beside that.\"\n\n\"Well, I guess I was kind of busy. You know, scared and mixed up.\"\n\n\"But didn't you notice our little pop-eyed friend?\"\n\n\"Oh, him. I'm afraid not, Captain. I--I guess I was thinking mostly of\nmyself.\"\n\n\"Hmmm. If I could only be sure I saw him. If only someone else saw him\ntoo.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I don't follow you, sir.\"\n\n\"Well, damn it all, you know that Forbes took a pot shot at him. Got\nhim in the leg. That being the case, why would the fuzzy little devil\ncome back to his tormentors--back to us--when we were trapped under\nthose logs?\"\n\n\"Well, I guess as long as we were trapped, he figured we couldn't do\nhim any more harm.... I'm sorry, that was a stupid answer. I guess I'm\nstill a little shaky.\"\n\n\"Forget it. Look, you go ahead to the ship and make ready for take-off.\nI'll join you in a few minutes. I think I'll go back and look around.\nYou know. Make sure we haven't left anyone.\"\n\n\"No need to do that. They're all ahead of us. I've checked.\"\n\n\"That's my responsibility, Cabot, not yours. Now go on.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs Purnie lay gathering strength for the long trek home, he saw through\nglazed eyes one of the animals coming back along the beach. When it was\nnearly directly below him, he could hear it making sounds that by now\nhad become familiar.\n\n\"Where are you?\"\n\nPurnie paid little attention to the antics of his friend; he was\nbeyond understanding. He wondered what they would say at home when he\nreturned.\n\n\"We've made a terrible mistake. We--\" The sounds faded in and out on\nPurnie's ears as the creature turned slowly and called in different\ndirections. He watched the animal walk over to the pile of scattered\nlogs and peer around and under them.\n\n\"If you're hurt I'd like to help!\" The twin moons were high in the sky\nnow, and where their light broke through the swirling clouds a double\nshadow was cast around the animal. With foggy awareness, Purnie watched\nthe creature shake its head slowly, then walk away in the direction of\nthe others.\n\nPurnie's eyes stared, without seeing, at the panorama before him. The\nbeach was deserted now, and his gaze was transfixed on a shimmering\nwhite square floating on the ocean. Across it, the last thing Purnie\never saw, was emblazoned the word FORBES.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Beach Scene, by Marshall King\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK BEACH SCENE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 51494.txt or 51494.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/1/4/9/51494/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
