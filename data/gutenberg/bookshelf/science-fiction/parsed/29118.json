Anything of interest to report?\"\n\n\"Not a thing, sir!\" growled my fire-eating first officer. \"I'm about\nready to quit the Service and get a job on one of the passenger liners,\njust on the off chance that something exciting might eventually happen.\"\n\n\"You were born a few centuries too late,\" I chuckled. Correy loved a\nfight more than any man I ever knew. \"The Universe has become pretty\nwell quieted down.\"\n\n\"Oh, it isn't that; it's just this infernal routine. Just one routine\npatrol after another; they should call it the Routine Patrol Service.\nThat's what the silver-sleeves at the Base are making of it, sir.\"\n\nAt the moment, Correy meant every word he said. Even old-timers develop\ncases of nerves, now and then, on long tours of duty in small ships like\nthe _Ertak_. Particularly men like Correy, whose bodies crave physical\naction.\n\nThere wasn't much opportunity for physical activity on the _Ertak_; she\nwas primarily a fighting ship, small and fast, with every inch of space\ndevoted to some utilitarian use. I knew just how Correy felt, because\nI'd felt the same way a great many times. I was young, then, one of the\nyoungest commanders the Special Patrol Service had ever had, and I\nrecognized Correy's symptoms in a twinkling.\n\n\"We'll be re-outfitting at the Arpan sub-base in a couple of days,\" I\nsaid carelessly. \"Give us a chance to stretch our legs. Have you seen\nanything of the liner that spoke to us yesterday?\" I was just making\nconversation, to get his mind out of its unhealthy channel.\n\n\"The _Kabit_? Yes, sir; we passed her early this morning, lumbering\nalong like the big fat pig that she is.\" A pig, I should explain, is a\nfood animal of Earth; a fat and ill-looking creature of low\nintelligence. \"The old _Ertak_ went by her as though she were standing\nstill. She'll be a week and more arriving at Arpan. Look: you can just\nbarely make her out on the charts.\"\n\nI glanced down at the twin charts Correy had indicated. In the center of\neach the red spark that represented the _Ertak_ glowed like a coal of\nfire; all around were the green pinpricks of light that showed the\nposition of other bodies around us. The _Kabit_, while comparatively\nclose, was just barely visible; her bulk was so small that it only\nfaintly activated the super-radio reflex plates upon the ship's hull.\n\n\"We're showing her a pretty pair of heels,\" I nodded, studying our\nposition in both dimensions. \"Arpan isn't registering yet, I see. Who's\nthis over here; Hydrot?\"\n\n\"Right, sir,\" replied Correy. \"Most useless world in the Universe, I\nguess. No good even for an emergency base.\"\n\n\"She's not very valuable, certainly,\" I admitted. \"Just a ball of water\nwhirling through space. But she does serve one good purpose; she's a\nsign-post it's impossible to mistake.\" Idly, I picked up Hydrot in the\ntelevision disk, gradually increasing the size of the image until I had\nher full in the field, at maximum magnification.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHydrot was a sizable sphere, somewhat larger than Earth--my natural\nstandard of comparison--and utterly devoid of visible land. She was, as\nI had said, just a ball of water, swinging along uselessly through\nspace, although no doubt there was land of some kind under that vast,\nunending stretch of gray water, for various observers had reported, in\ntimes past, bursts of volcanic steam issuing from the water.\n\nIndeed, as I looked, I saw one such jet of steam, shooting into space\nfrom a spot not far from the equator of the strange world. In the\ntelevision disk, it looked like a tiny wisp of white, barely visible\nagainst the gray water, but in reality it must have been a mighty\nroaring column of smoke and steam and erupted material.\n\n\"There's life in the old girl, anyway,\" I commented, indicating the\nimage in the disk. \"See her spout?\"\n\nWe bent over the disk together, watching the white feather of steam.\n\n\"First time I've ever seen that,\" said Correy. \"I know volcanic activity\nhas been reported before, but--look, sir! There's another--two more!\"\n\nUndoubtedly, things were happening deep in the bowels of Hydrot. There\nwere now three wisps of steam rising from the water, two of them fairly\nclose together, the other a considerable distance away, arranged to form\na very long pointed triangle, the short base of which ran close to the\nequator, its longer sides reaching toward one of the poles; the north\npole, as we happened to view the image.\n\nThe columns of steam seemed to increase in size. Certainly they mounted\nhigher into the air. I could imagine the terrific roar of them as they\nblasted their way through the sullen water and hurled it in steaming\nspray around their bases, while huge stones fell hissing into the water\non all sides. The eruption must have shaken the entire sphere; the\ngushing of those vomiting throats was a cataclysm of such magnitude that\nI could not guess its effect.\n\nCorrey and I watched tensely, hardly breathing. I think we both felt\nthat something was about to happen: a pent-up force had been released,\nand it was raging. We could almost hear the rumble of the volcanic\nexplosions and the ear-splitting hiss of the escaping steam.\n\nSuddenly Correy clutched my arm.\n\n\"Look!\" he whispered, \"_Look!_\"\n\nI nodded, not trusting myself to speak. I could see the water crawling\ninside the triangle formed by the three wisps of steam: crawling in\nwhite, foaming waves like tiny scraps of thread as it rushed headlong,\nin mighty tidal waves, away from the center of that triangle.\n\nThe columns of steam flared up with fresh strength, darkening as though\nwith smoke. Here and there within the triangle black specks appeared,\ngrew larger, and ran together in crooked lines that widened continually.\n\n\"A--a new continent, sir!\" said Correy almost reverently. \"We've seen a\nnew continent born.\"\n\nCorrey had put my thoughts into words. We had seen a new continent born;\non the gray surface of Hydrot there was now a great irregular black\nblotch from which mounted three waving pillars of smoke and steam.\nAround the shores of the new continent the waters raged, white and\nangry, and little threads of white crawled outward from those\nshores--the crests of tidal waves that must have towered into the air\ntwice the _Ertak's_ length.\n\nSlowly, the shore-line changed form as fresh portions arose, and others,\nnewly-risen, sank again beneath the gray water. The wisps of steam\ndarkened still more, and seemed to shrivel up, as though the fires that\nfed them had been exhausted by the travail of a new continent.\n\n\"Think, sir,\" breathed Correy, \"what we might find if we landed there on\nthat new continent, still dripping with the water from which it sprang!\nA part of the ocean's bed, thrust above the surface to be examined at\nwill--Couldn't we leave our course long enough to--to look her over?\"\n\nI confess I was tempted. Young John Hanson, Commander of the Special\nPatrol ship, _Ertak_, had his good share of natural curiosity, the\nspirit of adventure, and the explorer's urge. But at the same time, the\nService has a discipline that is as rigid and relentless as the passing\nof time itself.\n\nHydrot lay off to starboard of our course: Arpan, where we were to\nre-outfit, was ahead and to port, and we were already swinging in that\ndirection. The _Ertak_ was working on a close schedule that gave us no\nlatitude.\n\n\"I'm afraid it can't be done, Mr. Correy,\" I said, shaking my head.\n\"We'll report it immediately, of course, and perhaps we'll get orders to\nmake an investigation. In that case--\"\n\n\"Not the _Ertak_!\" interrupted Correy passionately. \"They'll send a crew\nof bug-eyed scientists there, and a score or so of laboratory men to\nanalyze this, and run a test on that, and the whole mess of them will\nwrite millions of words apiece about the expedition that nobody will\never read. I know.\"\n\n\"Well, we'll hope you're wrong.\" I said, knowing in my heart that he was\nperfectly right. \"Keep her on her present course, Mr. Correy.\"\n\n\"Present course it is, sir!\" snapped Correy. Then we bent together over\nthe old-fashioned hooded television disk staring down silently and\nregretfully at the continent we had seen born, and which, with all its\npromise of interest and adventure, we must leave behind, in favor of a\nroutine stop at the sub-base on Arpan.\n\nI think both of us would have gladly given years of our lives to turn\nthe _Ertak's_ blunt nose toward Hydrot, but we had our orders, and in\nthe Service as it was in those days, an officer did not question his\norders.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCorrey mooned around the Arpan sub-base like a fractious child. Kincaide\nand I endeavored to cheer him up, and Hendricks, the _Ertak's_ young\nthird officer, tried in vain to induce Correy to take in the sights.\n\n\"All I want to know,\" Correy insisted, \"is whether there's any change in\norders. You got the news through to Base, didn't you, sir?\"\n\n\"Right. All that came back was the usual 'Confirmed.' No comment.\"\nCorrey muttered under his breath and wandered off to glare at the\nArpanians who were working on the _Ertak_. Kincaide shrugged and shook\nhis head.\n\n\"He's spoiling for action, sir,\" he commented. Kincaide was my second\nofficer; a cool-headed, quick-witted fighting man, and as fine an\nofficer as ever wore the blue-and-silver uniform of the Service. \"I only\nhope--message for you, sir.\" He indicated an Arpanian orderly who had\ncome up from behind, and was standing at attention.\n\n\"You're wanted immediately in the radio room, sir,\" said the orderly,\nsaluting.\n\n\"Very well,\" I nodded, returning the salute and glancing at Kincaide.\n\"Perhaps we will get a change in orders after all.\"\n\nI hurried after the orderly, following him down the broad corridors of\nthe administration building to the radio room. The commander of the\nArpan sub-base was waiting there, talking gravely with the operator.\n\n\"Bad news, Commander,\" he said, as I entered the room. \"We've just\nreceived a report from the passenger liner _Kabit_, and she's in\ndesperate straits. At the insistence of the passengers, the ship made\ncontact with Hydrot and is unable to leave. She has been attacked by\nsome strange monster, or several of them--the message is badly confused.\nI thought perhaps you'd like to report the matter to Base yourself.\"\n\n\"Yes. Thank you, sir. Operator, please raise Base immediately!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe _Kabit_? That was the big liner we had spoken to the day before\nCorrey and I had seen the new continent rise above the boundless waters\nof Hydrot. I knew the ship; she carried about eighteen hundred\npassengers, and a crew of seventy-five men and officers. Beside her, the\n_Ertak_ was a pygmy; that the larger ship, so large and powerful, could\nbe in trouble, seemed impossible. Yet--\n\n\"Base, sir,\" said the operator, holding a radio-menore toward me.\n\nI placed the instrument on my head.\n\n\"John Hanson, Commander of the Special Patrol ship _Ertak_ emanating.\nSpecial report for Chief of Command.\"\n\n\"Report, Commander Hanson,\" emanated the Base operator automatically.\n\n\"Word has just been received at Arpan sub-base that passenger liner\n_Kabit_ made contact with Hydrot, landing somewhere on the new\ncontinent, previously reported by the _Ertak_. Liner _Kabit_ reports\nitself in serious difficulties, exact nature undetermined, but\napparently due to hostile activity from without. Will await\ninstructions.\"\n\n\"Confirmed. Commander Hanson's report will be put through to Chief of\nCommand immediately. Stand by.\"\n\nI removed the radio-menore, motioning to the operator to resume his\nwatch.\n\nRadio communication in those days was in its infancy. Several persons\nwho have been good enough to comment upon my previous chronicles of the\nSpecial Patrol Service, have asked \"But, Commander Hanson! Why didn't\nyou just radio for assistance?\" forgetting as young persons do, that\nthings have not always been as they are to-day.\n\nThe _Ertak's_ sending apparatus, for example, could reach out at best no\nmore than a day's journey in any direction, and then only imperfectly.\nTransmission of thought by radio instead of symbols or words, had been\nintroduced but a few years before I entered the Service. It must be\nremembered that I am an old, old man, writing of things that happened\nbefore most of the present population of the Universe was born--that I\nam writing of men who, for the larger part, have long since embarked\nupon the Greatest Adventure.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Base, sir,\" said the operator after a moment, and I hastily slipped on\nthe radio-menore.\n\n\"Commander John Hanson, standing by,\" I shot at the operator at Base.\n\"Have you orders?\"\n\n\"Orders for Captain John Hanson, Commander of the Special Patrol ship\n_Ertak_,\" emanated the operator in a sort of mental drone. \"Chief of\nCommand directs that the _Ertak_ proceed immediately to the scene of the\nreported difficulty, and take any necessary steps to relieve same. I\nwill repeat the orders,\" and he droned through them a second time.\n\n\"Orders are understood. The results of our operations will be reported\nto Base as soon as possible.\" I tore off the radio-menore and hurried\nfrom the room, explaining to the sub-base commander as I went.\n\nCorrey was standing beside the _Ertak_, talking to Kincaide, and as I\napproached, they both looked around quickly and hopefully.\n\n\"What's up, sir?\" asked Correy, reading news in my face. \"A change in\norders?\"\n\n\"Correct! That big liner, the _Kabit_, landed on Hydrot, and she's in\nsome sort of mysterious trouble. Orders from the Chief himself are to\nproceed there immediately. Are any men away from the ship on leave?\"\n\n\"If there are, we can do without them!\" shouted Correy. \"I'll stand a\ndouble watch.\"\n\n\"The crew is on duty, sir,\" said Kincaide quietly. \"Mr. Hendricks is\naboard directing the taking on of supplies. We can leave any time you\norder, sir.\"\n\n\"We leave immediately, gentlemen,\" I said. \"Mr. Correy, will you give\nthe necessary orders?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\" grinned Correy, his eyes dancing like a schoolboy's. He was\nin the navigating room jabbing attention signals and snapping orders\ninto the microphone before Kincaide and I, moving more leisurely, had\nentered the ship.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHurtling through space at maximum speed, it took us two days, Earth\ntime, to come close enough to Hydrot so that we could locate the\nunfortunate _Kabit_. She had landed on a level plain near the shore of\nthe new continent, where she lay, just a tiny bright speck, even under\nthe maximum power of our television disk.\n\n\"It's an odd thing, sir, that we can't raise her by radio,\" commented\nHendricks, who was on duty. \"Have we tried recently?\"\n\n\"We've been trying constantly, at intervals of but a few minutes,\" I\nreplied grimly. \"Several times, the operator reports, he has been able\nto get a muffled and garbled response, utterly unintelligible. He says\nthat the signals sound as though the radio emanation-plates in her outer\nhull were damaged or grounded. We'll just have to wait until we get\nthere.\"\n\n\"As soon as we are near enough, please make an analysis of her\natmosphere, so that we can break out masks, if necessary.\" Hendricks,\nwhile young and rather too impulsive, was a good rough-and-ready\nscientist, as well as a courageous and dependable officer. \"When Mr.\nCorrey relieves you, please inform him that I am taking a watch below,\nshould he need me.\" Hydrot was looming up in the television disk, and I\nwished to be rested and ready for action when we landed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI was awakened by an uncomfortable warmth, and when I glanced at my\nwatch the explanation was obvious. We had penetrated the outer gaseous\nenvelope of the world that had so recently given birth to a continent,\nand Correy was driving the _Ertak_ through at reckless speed.\n\nWhen I entered the navigating room, Correy glanced up guiltily at the\nsurface-temperature gauge and then hastily saluted.\n\n\"We're reducing speed, sir,\" he said. \"Atmosphere is rather denser than\nI had expected. Hendricks reports the air breathable, with a humidity of\none hundred. And--tell me, sir, what do you make of the appearance of\nthe _Kabit_ now?\"\n\nI bent over the hooded television disk anxiously. The _Kabit_ was in the\ncenter of the field, and the image was perhaps a third of the disk's\ndiameter in length.\n\nInstead of a tiny bright speck, I could see now the fat bulk of the\nship, its bright metal gleaming--but across or around the ship, were\nbroad spiral bands of black or dark green, as sharp as though they had\nbeen painted there.\n\n\"What are the bands, Mr. Correy?\" I asked sharply. \"Have you formed any\nopinion?\"\n\n\"I have, sir, but I'd rather not offer it at this time,\" said my first\nofficer gravely. \"Look about the ship, in the immediate vicinity, and\nsee if you find anything of interest. My eyes may be playing me tricks.\"\n\nI glanced curiously at Correy, and then bent my attention on the image\nin the disk.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was impossible to make out any details of the background, save that\nthe country round seemed to be fairly level, with great pools of gray\nwater standing here and there, and a litter, as of gigantic, wilted\nvegetation, spread over everything.\n\nAnd then, as I looked, it seemed to me that the _Kabit_ shifted position\nslightly. At the same time, the spiral bands seemed to move, and upon\nthe ground around the ship, there was movement also.\n\nI looked up from the disk, feeling Correy's eyes upon me. We stared at\neach other, neither wishing to speak--hardly daring to speak. There are\nsome things too monstrous to put into words.\n\n\"You--you saw it, sir?\" asked Correy at last, his voice scarcely more\nthan a whisper.\n\n\"I don't know. I think I saw something like a--a snake. Is that what you\nmean?\"\n\n\"Yes. Something like a snake. A snake that has wrapped itself around the\n_Kabit_, holding it helpless ... a serpent....\" He gestured helplessly,\na sort of horror in his eyes. I think he had convinced himself he had\nonly imagined the serpent, until I had seen the same thing.\n\n\"Have you stopped to think, Mr. Correy,\" I asked slowly, \"how long the\ncreature would have to be to wrap itself like that around a liner the\nsize of the _Kabit_? It--it can't be!\"\n\n\"I know it, sir,\" nodded Correy. \"I know it. And still, I saw it, and\nyou saw it.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I muttered. \"I saw it. I--I saw it _move_!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe maintained a speed that kept the surface-temperature gauge\ndangerously close to maximum permissible reading, and despite the forced\nventilation of the ship, we were dripping with perspiration.\n\nAtmospheric speeds are maddeningly low after the reckless, hurtling\nspeed of space travel, but our vaunted scientists haven't yet found a\nway of eliminating friction, and we had to make the best of it.\n\nWith maddening slowness the image in the television disk grew larger and\nclearer, relentlessly confirming our original conclusion.\n\nThe _Kabit_ was wrapped in the coils of a mighty serpent; a monster that\nmust have been the height of a man in diameter, and whose length I could\nnot even guess.\n\nFour coils were looped tightly about the _Kabit_, and we could now see\nthe terrible tail of the thing, and its head.\n\nI have always been glad that the details of that ghastly head became\nvisible gradually: viewed suddenly, in full relief, it was a sight that\nmight well have threatened the reason of any man.\n\nThe serpent's mouth was lined with a triple row of long, fang-like\nteeth, tilted gullet-ward at a sharp angle, and the breathing holes were\nelevated to form warty excrudescences near the end of the snoutish upper\njaw. Long colorless tentacles fringed the horrible mouth: barbels that\nwrithed incessantly, as though they sought food for the rapacious jaws\nthey guarded. From a point slightly above and to the rear of the tiny,\nruby eyes, two slim and graceful antennae, iridescent and incongruously\nbeautiful, rose twice the height of a man. Like the antennae of a\nbutterfly, they were surmounted by tiny knobs, and were in constant\nmotion.\n\nThe whole head was armored with great plates or scales, dark green in\ncolor; and apparently of tremendous thickness. A short distance behind\nthe head were two tremendous reddish-brown fins, with strong supporting\nspines that seemed to terminate in retractile claws. In the water, these\nfins would undoubtedly be of tremendous value in swimming and in\nfighting, but on land they seemed rather useless. Aside from a\nrudimentary dorsal fin, a series of black, stubby spines, connected by a\nbarely visible webbing, the thing had no other external evidences of its\nmarine origin.\n\n\"You've been restless for action, Mr. Correy,\" I commented grimly. \"I\nbelieve this chap will give us all you could desire.\"\n\nCorrey, still staring down into the disk, fascinated by the terrible\ndetails there, shook his head.\n\n\"It shouldn't be such a stiff battle, sir,\" he said. \"The ray will make\nquick work of him once we're within distance.\"\n\n\"Yes--and of the _Kabit_ and all on board,\" I reminded him. \"If he has\nthe strength his size would indicate, he would crush the liner in his\ndeath agonies, or, failing that, would heave it about so violently that\nthose within would be maimed or killed outright. This is a case for\ncunning, and not might.\"\n\n\"I think, sir, both cunning and might will be needed,\" said Correy\nsoberly, looking up from the disk. \"Cunning alone will not dispose of\nthat lad. Have you any plans?\"\n\n\"Rough plans only; we'll have to develop them as we go along. We don't\nknow what we'll be up against. We'll land a safe distance away, and a\nsmall expeditionary force will attack as it sees fit; probably, dividing\nitself into two or three units. The _Ertak_ will be manned by a skeleton\ncrew and ready to take any necessary action to protect itself or, if\npossible, to aid any of the expeditionary parties.\"\n\n\"What weapons, sir?\" asked Correy, his eyes gleaming. \"I'll give the\norders now!\"\n\n\"It's too soon for that; it'll be an hour at least before we land. But I\nbelieve every man, including officers, should be armed with pistols, at\nleast six atomic bombs, and there should be a field disintegrator-ray\nunit for each party. And each member must be equipped with a menore;\ncommunication will be by menore only. You might call Mr. Kincaide and\nMr. Hendricks, and we'll hold a little council of war.\"\n\n\"Right, sir!\" said Correy, and picked up the microphone. Kincaide and\nHendricks were in the room almost within the minute.\n\nWe laid our plans as best we could, but they weren't very definite. Only\na few things were certain.\n\nSomehow, we must induce the monster to release his grasp on the _Kabit_.\nWe could take no action against the serpent until the big liner and her\npassengers were safe. It was a desperate mission; an enterprise not of\nthe _Ertak_, but of individuals.\n\n\"One thing is certain, sir,\" commented Correy, taking over by visual\nnavigation, and reducing speed still more, \"you must remain in charge of\nthe ship. You will be needed--\"\n\n\"I understand your motives, Mr. Correy,\" I interrupted, \"but I do not\nagree with you. As Commander of the _Ertak_, I shall command the\nactivities of her men. You will have charge of one landing force, and\nMr. Hendricks of another. You, Mr. Kincaide, I shall ask to remain in\ncharge of the ship.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir,\" nodded Kincaide, swallowing his disappointment. I\nshould have liked to have Kincaide with me, for he was level-headed and\ncool in an emergency--but it was because of these very things that I\nwanted him in charge of the _Ertak_.\n\n\"We're close enough now, sir, to select a landing place,\" put in Correy.\n\"There's a likely spot, a safe distance away and apparently level,\nalmost on the shore. Shall I set her down there?\"\n\n\"Use your own judgment, Mr. Correy. You may order the landing force to\narm and report at the exit port. As soon as you have made contact, you\nand Mr. Hendricks will report to me there.\n\n\"Mr. Kincaide, you will remain on duty here. I am leaving the conduct of\nthe ship entirely to your judgment, asking you to remember only that the\nrescue of the _Kabit_ and her nearly two thousand souls is the object of\nthis expedition, and the safety of our own personnel cannot be given\nprimary consideration.\"\n\n\"I understand, sir,\" nodded Kincaide gravely. He held out his hand in\nthat familiar gesture of Earth, which may mean so much more than men\never dare put into words, and we shook hands silently.\n\nThere were to be three landing parties of five men and one officer\neach--eighteen men against a creature that held a mighty passenger liner\nin its coils!\n\n\"I wish, sir, that I were going in your place,\" said Kincaide softly.\n\n\"I know that. But--waiting here will be the hardest job of all. I'm\nleaving that for you.\" I turned and hurried out of the room, to make my\nentries in the log--perhaps my last entries--and secure my equipment.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere are times, in setting down these old tales of the Special Patrol\nService as it was before they tacked a \"Retired\" after my name and\ntitle, that I wish I had been a bit more studious during my youth. I\nfind myself in need of words, and possessed only of memories.\n\nI wish I could think of words that would describe the sight that\nconfronted us when we emerged from the _Ertak_ and set foot upon the\nsoil of that newly-born continent of Hydrot, but I find I cannot. I have\ntried many times, and I find my descriptions fall far short of the\npicture I still carry in my mind.\n\nThe ground was a vast littered floor of wilted marine growths, some\nalready rotting away, while others, more hardy, or with roots reaching\ninto as yet undried ooze, retained a sort of freshness. Crab-like\ncreatures scuttled in all directions, apparently feasting upon the\nplentiful carrion. The stench was terrible, almost overpowering at\nfirst, but after a few minutes we became accustomed to it, and, in the\nintensity of the work we had undertaken, it was forgotten.\n\nProgress was not possible on the ground. Sheltered from the sun by the\nthick growths it supported, it was still treacherously soft. But the\ngiant marine vegetation that had retained something of its vigor\nprovided a highway, difficult and dangerous and uncertain, but passable.\n\nI remained with the party taking the most direct route to the\nunfortunate _Kabit_, while Correy and Hendricks led the parties to my\nleft and right, respectively. We kept in constant touch with each other\nby means of our menores.\n\n\"I believe,\" emanated Correy, \"that the beast sees us. I had a good view\nof him a few seconds back, and his head was elevated and pointed this\nway.\"\n\n\"It's possible,\" I replied. \"Be careful, however, to do nothing to alarm\nor excite him. All men must keep under cover, and proceed with as little\nnoise and commotion as possible. I'm going to see, now, if I can get in\ntouch with anyone on the _Kabit_; with full power, communication might\nbe possible even through the _Kabit's_ grounded hull.\"\n\n\"It's worth trying,\" agreed Hendricks. \"These new menores are powerful.\"\n\nI adjusted the little atomic generator to maximum, and replaced the\ninstrument on my head.\n\n\"On board the _Kabit_!\" I emanated, trying by sheer mental effort to\ndrive the thought over that stinking waste, and through the massive\ndouble hull of the liner. \"Ahoy the _Kabit_!\"\n\n\"This is Captain Gole,\" flashed back the answer instantly. \"Captain Gole\nof the passenger liner _Kabit_. You are from the _Ertak_?\"\n\n\"Commander Hanson of the _Ertak_ emanating. How are conditions on the\n_Kabit_?\"\n\n\"Ghastly!\" I could sense the feeling in the word, faintly as it smote\nupon my consciousness. \"My officers are keeping the crew under some sort\nof control, but the passengers are unmanageable. They are\nfrantic--insane with terror. Two or three have already gone mad. I am on\nthe verge of insanity myself. Have you seen the thing that has us\ntrapped?\"\n\n\"Yes. We are coming to your aid. Tell your passengers to calm\nthemselves. We'll find a way out of this somehow. You know the motto of\nour Service.\"\n\n\"Yes: '_Nothing Less Than Complete Success!_' I have already issued a\nbulletin to the effect that I am in contact with your ship. I think it\nhas had a good effect. The clamor is quieting somewhat; you don't know\nwhat a terrible strain this has been, sir!\"\n\nI could well imagine his mental state. The captain of the _Kabit_ was a\nZenian, and the Zenians are too high-strung to stand up under a severe\nstrain.\n\n\"It may help us if you'll tell us, very briefly, the history of your\nexperience here,\" I suggested. \"We're going up against something we know\nnothing about. Perhaps you can give us some valuable information.\"\n\n\"I doubt it, for there's very little to tell. Undoubtedly, you have the\nreport which I managed to get through to Arpan before our radio\nemanation plates were put out of commission.\n\n\"Against my better judgment, we set down here upon the insistence of the\npassengers. The television instruments revealed nothing more dangerous\nthan the small life in the marine growths left stranded by the receding\nwater.\n\n\"I unsealed one of the exit ports, and a small party of the more curious\npassengers, under the escort of my second officer and six men, ventured\nforth on a little tour of exploration. A goodly portion of the remaining\npassengers huddled close to the ship, contenting themselves with\nsouvenir-hunting close by.\n\n\"Suddenly there was a great sound of shouting from the exploring party.\nNot knowing the danger, but realizing that something was wrong, the\npassengers rushed into the ship. Helplessly, for we are utterly\ndefenseless, I watched the fleeing party of explorers.\n\n\"For a moment, I could not see why they fled; I could only see them\nscrambling desperately toward the ship, and casting frightened glances\nbehind them. Then I saw the thing's head rear itself from the slimy\ntangle of vegetation, and behind it the wilting growths were lashed to\nshreds.\n\n\"The head drove forward. My second officer, courageously bringing up the\nrear, was the first victim. Perhaps his bright uniform attracted the\nbeast's attention. I don't know.\n\n\"They were close now; very close. I knew that we were in danger, and yet\nI could not bear to seal the port in the faces of those helpless men\nracing towards the ship.\n\n\"I waited. Twice more the terrible head shot out and both times a man\nwas picked from the fleeing ranks. It was terrible--ghastly.\n\n\"The rest of them reached the ship, and as the last man came reeling\nthrough the port, the door swung shut and began spinning upon its\nthreads. Almost instantly I gave the order for vertical ascent at\nemergency speed, but before the order could be obeyed, the ship lurched\nsuddenly, rolled half over, and swung back with a jolt. As the power was\napplied, the ship rose at a crazy angle, hung there trembling for a\nmoment, and then sank back to the ground. The load was too great. I knew\nthen that we were in the power of the thing that had come wriggling out\nof that sea of rotting weeds.\n\n\"I got the message off to Arpan before our radio emanation plates were\ngrounded or destroyed by the coils of the monster. At intervals, I have\ntried to pull away, but each time the thing tightens its coils angrily,\nuntil the fabric of the ship groans under the strain. We have heard you\ncalling us, faintly and faultily. I have been waiting for you to reach\nme with the menore. You have come at last, and I am at your orders. If\nyou cannot help us, we are lost, for we shall all go mad.\"\n\n\"We'll have you in the clear very soon,\" I assured him with a confidence\nI did not feel. \"Stand by for further communications, and--are your\ngenerators working?\"\n\n\"Yes. They're in perfect order. If only the beast would uncoil\nhimself--\"\n\n\"We'll see to that very shortly. Stand by.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI reduced power and asked Correy and Hendricks if they had both followed\nthe conversation. They had, and had now reduced power, as I had done. We\nall realized that our counsels might not be reassuring to Captain Gole.\n\n\"As I see it, gentlemen, the first thing we must do is to induce the\nbeast to leave the _Kabit_. And the only way that can be accomplished is\nby--bait.\"\n\n\"Exactly!\" snapped Correy. \"He's hungry. He knows there's food in the\n_Kabit_. If we can get him to leave the liner and come after us, the\nproblem's solved.\"\n\n\"But he can run faster than we. I can hardly crawl over this slimy\nmess,\" objected Hendricks. \"I'm ready to try everything, but remember\nthat we've got to lead him away far enough to make him release the\n_Kabit_.\"\n\n\"I've got it!\" emanated Correy suddenly, his enthusiasm making the\nvibrations from the menore fairly hammer into my brain. \"I'll cut a\nlong, narrow swath with one of the portable disintegrator rays; long\nenough to take him far away from the _Kabit_, and just wide enough to\npass a man. I'll run along this deep groove, just below the reach of the\nmonster. I can make good time; the serpent'll have to slash and wriggle\nhis way over or through this slimy growth. How's that for an idea?\"\n\nIt was daring enough to have some hope of success, but its dangers were\nobvious.\n\n\"What happens when you reach the end of the path the ray cuts?\" I asked\ngrimly.\n\n\"You and Hendricks, with your men, will be on both sides of the path,\nnot opposite each other. When he passes, you'll let go your\ndisintegrator rays and the atomic bombs. He'll be in a dozen pieces\nbefore we reach the end of the path.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSpread out here before me, in all its wordy detail, it would seem that a\nlong time must have elapsed while Captain Gole related his story, and my\nofficers and myself laid our plans. As a matter of fact, communicating\nas we were by menore, it was only a minute or so since Correy had\nemanated his first comment: \"I believe the beast sees us. His head was\nelevated and pointed this way.\"\n\nAnd now Hendricks, who was peering over the ruffled edge of an\nundulating, rubbery leaf of seaweed, turned and waved both arms.\nDisobeying my strictest orders, he fairly screamed his frantic warning:\n\n\"He sees us! He sees us! He's coming!\"\n\nI ran up the twisted, concave surface of a giant stem of some kind. To\nmy left, I could hear the shrill whine of Correy's disintegrator ray\ngenerator, already in action, and protesting against a maximum load. To\nthe right, Hendricks and his men were scrambling into position. Before\nme was the enemy.\n\nSlowly, deliberately, as though he did not doubt his terrible ability,\nhe unwrapped his coils from the _Kabit_. His head, with its graceful\nantennae searching the air, and the tentacles around his mouth writhing\nhungrily, reared itself ten times a man's height from the ground. His\nsmall red eyes flashed like precious stones. Beyond, the mighty greenish\ncoils slashed the rotting weed as he unwrapped them from the _Kabit_.\n\nI snatched off my menore and adjusted it again for maximum power.\n\n\"Captain Gole!\"\n\n\"Yes. What's happening? Tell me! We're rolling and pitching.\"\n\n\"In a moment you'll be free. When I signal 'Rise!' ascend as quickly as\npossible to a safe distance. Stand by!\"\n\n\"Hendricks! Be ready to follow Correy's plan. It's our only chance. In a\nsecond, now--\"\n\nThe last coil moved, slipped from the blunt nose of the liner.\n\n\"Rise!\" I ordered. \"_Rise!_\"\n\nI saw the ship rock suddenly, and roar hollowly toward the sky. I felt\nthe rush of wind made by her passing.\n\nThen, head still elevated and swaying, the two great reddish-brown fins\nfanning the air like grotesque wings, the serpent lashed out towards us,\ncoming at amazing speed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCorrey, sure that he was observed by the serpent, leaped down from the\nhuge leaf upon which he had been standing. Hendricks and I, followed by\nour men, scrambled desperately toward the deep path or lane that\nCorrey's ray had cut through the tangled, stinking growth. Correy's plan\nhad given some promise of success, had we had time to put it into proper\noperation. As it was, neither Hendricks or I had had time to get into\nposition.\n\nHendricks, on my right, was working his way as rapidly as possible\ntoward the path, but he had a long way to go. Unless a miracle happened,\nhe would be too late to help. The portable ray machines would be\nhelpless against such a mighty bulk, except at close range.\n\nI reached the path and glanced hastily to the right, the direction, from\nwhich the great serpent was sweeping down on us. He was less than the\n_Ertak's_ length away.\n\n\"Hide, men!\" I ordered. \"Under the vegetation--in the muck--anywhere!\" I\nglanced down the lane to the left, and saw, to my relief, that Correy\nand his men were a goodly distance away, and still far from the end of\nthe swath their ray had cut for them. Then, with the monster towering\nalmost over my head. I darted behind a spongy, spotted growth,\nlistening, above the pounding of my heart, to the rapid slithering of\nthe serpent's ponderous body.\n\nOf a sudden the sound stopped. I was conscious of an excited warning\nfrom Hendricks: \"He's stopped, sir! _Run!_ He's seen you ... he--\"\n\nStartled, I glanced up--directly into the hideous face of the snake.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt seemed to me he was grinning. His mouth was partially open, and the\npale, writhing barbels that surrounded his mouth seemed to reach out\ntoward me. The long and graceful antennae were bent downward\ninquiringly, quivering tensely, and his small eyes glowed like\nwind-fanned coals of fire. The brownish fins were rigid as metal, the\nretractile claws unsheathed and cruelly curved. He was so close that I\ncould hear the air rushing through his crater-like breathing holes.\n\nFor an instant we stared at each other; he with confident gloating:\nmyself, too startled and horrified to move. Then, as his head shot\ndownward, I leaped aside.\n\nThe scaly head raked the clothes from one side of my body, and sent me,\nsprawling and breathless, into the welter of sagging weeds.\n\nI heard the sharp whine of my ray generator going into action, but I\ntook no chances on the accuracy of my men. They were working under\ntremendous difficulties. As I fell, I snatched an atomic bomb from my\nbelt, and, as the horrid head drew back to strike again, I threw the\nbomb with all my strength.\n\nI had thrown from an exceedingly awkward position, and the bomb exploded\nharmlessly some distance away, showering us with muck and slimy\nvegetation.\n\nEvidently, however, the explosion startled the serpent, for his head\nslewed around nervously, and I felt the ground tremble under me as his\nmighty coils lashed the ground in anger. Scrambling to my feet, I seized\nthe projector tube of the disintegrator ray and swept the beam upward\nuntil it beat upon that terrible head.\n\nThe thing screamed--a high, thin sound almost past the range of\naudibility. Reddish dust sifted down around me--the heavy dust of\ndisintegration. In the distance, I could hear the slashing of the tail\nas it tore through the rubbery growth of weeds.\n\nWith half his head eroded by the ray, the serpent struck again, but this\ntime his aim was wild. The mighty head half buried itself in the muck\nbeside me, and I swung the projector tube down so that the full force of\nthe ray tore into the region above and behind the eyes, where I imagined\nthe brain to be. The heavy reddish dust fairly pelted from the ugly\nhead.\n\nCorrey had come running back. Dimly, I could hear him shouting.\n\n\"Look out!\" I warned him. \"Keep back, Correy! Keep the men back! I've\ngot him, but he'll die hard--\"\n\nAs though to prove my words true, the head, a ghastly thing eroded into\na shapeless mass, was jerked from the mud, and two tremendous loops of\ntortured body came hurtling over my head. One of the huge fins swung by\nlike a sail, its hooked talons ripping one of Correy's men into bloody\nshreds. Correy himself, caught in a desperate endeavor to save the\nunfortunate man, was knocked twenty feet. For one terrible instant, I\nthought the beast had killed Correy also.\n\nGasping, Correy rose to his feet, and I ran to assist him.\n\n\"Back, men!\" I shouted. \"Hendricks! Get away as far and as fast as you\ncan. Back! _Back!_\" Half dragging Correy, who was still breathless from\nthe blow, I hurried after the men.\n\nBehind us, shaking the earth in his death agonies, the monstrous serpent\nbeat the plain about him into a veritable sea of slime.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFrom a point of vantage, atop the _Ertak_, we watched for the end.\n\n\"I have never,\" said Correy in an awed voice, \"seen anything take so\nlong to die.\"\n\n\"You have never before,\" I commented grimly, \"seen a snake so large. It\ntook ages to grow that mighty body; it is but natural that, even with\nthe brain disintegrated into dust, the body would not die immediately.\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly he has a highly decentralized nervous system,\" nodded\nHendricks, who was, as I have said, something of a practical scientific\nman, although no laboratory worker or sniveling scientist. \"And instinct\nis directing him back toward the sea from which, all unwillingly, he\ncame. Look--he's almost in the water.\"\n\n\"I don't care where he goes,\" said Correy savagely, \"so he goes there as\ncarrion. Clark was a good man, sir.\" Clark was the man the serpent had\nkilled.\n\n\"True,\" I said. Making the entry of that loss would hurt; even though\nthe discipline of the Service is--or at least, used to be--very rigid,\nofficers get rather close to their men during the course of many tours\nof duty in the confines of a little ship like the _Ertak_. \"But the\n_Kabit_, with her nearly two thousand souls, is safe.\"\n\nWe all looked up. The _Kabit_ was no longer visible. Battered, but still\nspace-worthy, she had gone on her way.\n\n\"I suppose,\" grinned Correy, \"that we'll be thanked by radio.\" The grin\nwas real; Correy had had action enough to make him happy for a time. The\nnervous tension was gone.\n\n\"Probably. But--watch our friend! He's in the water at last. I imagine\nthat's the last we'll see of him.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHalf of the tremendous body was already in the water, lashing it into\nwhite foam. The rest of the great length slid, twitching, down the\nshore. The water boiled and seethed; dark loops flipped above the\nsurface and disappeared. And then, as though the giant serpent had found\npeace at last, the waters subsided, and only the wreaths of white foam\nupon the surface showed where he had sunk to the ooze that had given him\nbirth.\n\n\"Finish,\" I commented. \"All that's left is for the scientists to flock\nhere to admire his bones. They'll probably condemn us for ruining his\nskull. It took them a good many thousand years to find the remains of a\nsea-serpent on Earth, you remember.\"\n\n\"Some time in the Twenty-second Century, wasn't it, sir?\" asked\nHendricks. \"I think my memory serves me well.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't swear to it. I know that sailors reported them for ages, but\nthat wouldn't do for the laboratory men and the scientists. They had to\nhave the bones right before them, subject to tests and measurements.\"\n\nThat's the trouble with the scientists, I've found. Their ability to\nbelieve is atrophied. They can't see beyond their laboratory tables.\n\nOf course, I'm just an old man, and perhaps I'm bitter with the drying\nsap of age. That's what I've been told. \"Old John Hanson\" they call me,\nand smile as if to say that explains everything.\n\nOld? Of course I'm old! But the years behind me are not empty years. I\ndidn't spend them bending over little instruments, or compiling rows of\nfigures.\n\nAnd I was right about the scientists--they did put in a protest\nconcerning our thoughtlessness in ruining the head of the serpent. They\ncould only estimate the capacity of the brain-pan, argue about the\ncephalic index, and guess at the frontal angle: it was a terrible blow\nto science.\n\nBitter old John Hanson!\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Terror from the Depths\nby Sewell Peaslee Wright\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE TERROR FROM THE DEPTHS ***\n\n***** This file should be named 29118.txt or 29118.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.net/2/9/1/1/29118/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online Distributed\nProofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
