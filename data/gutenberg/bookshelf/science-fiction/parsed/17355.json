It was not a graceful proceeding. The hands\nhad been moving onward in their customary deliberate fashion,\nslowly and thoughtfully, but suddenly the people in the offices\nnear the clock's face heard an ominous creaking and groaning.\nThere was a slight, hardly discernible shiver through the tower,\nand then something gave with a crash. The big hands on the clock\nbegan to move backward.\n\nImmediately after the crash all the creaking and groaning ceased,\nand instead, the usual quiet again hung over everything. One or\ntwo of the occupants of the upper offices put their heads out into\nthe halls, but the elevators were running as usual, the lights\nwere burning, and all seemed calm and peaceful. The clerks and\nstenographers went back to their ledgers and typewriters, the\nbusiness callers returned to the discussion of their errands,\nand the ordinary course of business was resumed.\n\nArthur Chamberlain was dictating a letter to Estelle Woodward,\nhis sole stenographer. When the crash came he paused, listened,\nand then resumed his task.\n\nIt was not a difficult one. Talking to Estelle Woodward was at\nno time an onerous duty, but it must be admitted that Arthur\nChamberlain found it difficult to keep his conversation strictly\nupon his business.\n\nHe was at this time engaged in dictating a letter to his principal\ncreditors, the Gary & Milton Company, explaining that their demand\nfor the immediate payment of the installment then due upon his office\nfurniture was untimely and unjust. A young and budding engineer in\nNew York never has too much money, and when he is young as Arthur\nChamberlain was, and as fond of pleasant company, and not too\nfond of economizing, he is liable to find all demands for payment\nuntimely and he usually considers them unjust as well. Arthur\nfinished dictating the letter and sighed.\n\n\"Miss Woodward,\" he said regretfully, \"I am afraid I shall never\nmake a successful man.\"\n\nMiss Woodward shook her head vaguely. She did not seem to take his\nremark very seriously, but then, she had learned never to take any of\nhis remarks seriously. She had been puzzled at first by his manner of\ntreating everything with a half-joking pessimism, but now ignored it.\n\nShe was interested in her own problems. She had suddenly decided\nthat she was going to be an old maid, and it bothered her. She\nhad discovered that she did not like any one well enough to marry,\nand she was in her twenty-second year.\n\nShe was not a native of New York, and the few young men she had met\nthere she did not care for. She had regretfully decided she was too\nfinicky, too fastidious, but could not seem to help herself. She\ncould not understand their absorption in boxing and baseball and\nshe did not like the way they danced.\n\nShe had considered the matter and decided that she would have to\nreconsider her former opinion of women who did not marry. Heretofore\nshe had thought there must be something the matter with them.\nNow she believed that she would come to their own estate, and\nprobably for the same reason. She could not fall in love and she\nwanted to.\n\nShe read all the popular novels and thrilled at the love-scenes\ncontained in them, but when any of the young men she knew became\nin the slightest degree sentimental she found herself bored, and\ndisgusted with herself for being bored. Still, she could not help it,\nand was struggling to reconcile herself to a life without romance.\n\nShe was far too pretty for that, of course, and Arthur Chamberlain\noften longed to tell her how pretty she really was, but her\nabstracted air held him at arms' length.\n\nHe lay back at ease in his swivel-chair and considered, looking at\nher with unfeigned pleasure. She did not notice it, for she was so\nmuch absorbed in her own thoughts that she rarely noticed anything\nhe said or did when they were not in the line of her duties.\n\n\"Miss Woodward,\" he repeated, \"I said I think I'll never make a\nsuccessful man. Do you know what that means?\"\n\nShe looked at him mutely, polite inquiry in her eyes.\n\n\"It means,\" he said gravely, \"that I'm going broke. Unless something\nturns up in the next three weeks, or a month at the latest, I'll\nhave to get a job.\"\n\n\"And that means--\" she asked.\n\n\"All this will go to pot,\" he explained with a sweeping gesture. \"I\nthought I'd better tell you as much in advance as I could.\"\n\n\"You mean you're going to give up your office--and me?\" she asked,\na little alarmed.\n\n\"Giving up you will be the harder of the two,\" he said with a smile,\n\"but that's what it means. You'll have no difficulty finding a new\nplace, with three weeks in which to look for one, but I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, too, Mr. Chamberlain,\" she said, her brow puckered.\n\nShe was not really frightened, because she knew she could get\nanother position, but she became aware of rather more regret than\nshe had expected.\n\nThere was silence for a moment.\n\n\"Jove!\" said Arthur, suddenly. \"It's getting dark, isn't it?\"\n\nIt was. It was growing dark with unusual rapidity. Arthur went to\nhis window, and looked out.\n\n\"Funny,\" he remarked in a moment or two. \"Things don't look just\nright, down there, somehow. There are very few people about.\"\n\nHe watched in growing amazement. Lights came on in the streets\nbelow, but none of the buildings lighted up. It grew darker and\ndarker.\n\n\"It shouldn't be dark at this hour!\" Arthur exclaimed.\n\nEstelle went to the window by his side.\n\n\"It looks awfully queer,\" she agreed. \"It must be an eclipse\nor something.\"\n\nThey heard doors open in the hall outside, and Arthur ran out. The\nhalls were beginning to fill with excited people.\n\n\"What on earth's the matter?\" asked a worried stenographer.\n\n\"Probably an eclipse,\" replied Arthur. \"Only it's odd we didn't\nread about it in the papers.\"\n\nHe glanced along the corridor. No one else seemed better informed\nthan he, and he went back into his office.\n\nEstelle turned from the window as he appeared.\n\n\"The streets are deserted,\" she said in a puzzled tone. \"What's\nthe matter? Did you hear?\"\n\nArthur shook his head and reached for the telephone.\n\n\"I'll call up and find out,\" he said confidently. He held the\nreceiver to his ear. \"What the--\" he exclaimed. \"Listen to this!\"\n\nA small-sized roar was coming from the receiver. Arthur hung up\nand turned a blank face upon Estelle.\n\n\"Look!\" she said suddenly, and pointed out of the window.\n\nAll the city was now lighted up, and such of the signs as they\ncould see were brilliantly illumined. They watched in silence.\nThe streets once more seemed filled with vehicles. They darted along,\ntheir headlamps lighting up the roadway brilliantly. There was,\nhowever, something strange even about their motion. Arthur and\nEstelle watched in growing amazement and perplexity.\n\n\"Are--are you seeing what I am seeing?\" asked Estelle\nbreathlessly. \"_I_ see them _going backward_!\"\n\nArthur watched, and collapsed into a chair.\n\n\"For the love of Mike!\" he exclaimed softly.\n\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\nHe was roused by another exclamation from Estelle.\n\n\"It's getting light again,\" she said.\n\nArthur rose and went eagerly to the window. The darkness was\nbecoming less intense, but in a way Arthur could hardly credit.\n\nFar to the west, over beyond the Jersey hills--easily visible from\nthe height at which Arthur's office was located--a faint light\nappeared in the sky, grew stronger and then took on a reddish\ntint. That, in turn, grew deeper, and at last the sun appeared,\nrising unconcernedly _in the west_.\n\nArthur gasped. The streets below continued to be thronged with\npeople and motor-cars. The sun was traveling with extraordinary\nrapidity. It rose overhead, and as if by magic the streets\nwere thronged with people. Every one seemed to be running\nat top-speed. The few teams they saw moved at a breakneck\npace--backward! In spite of the suddenly topsyturvy state of\naffairs there seemed to be no accidents.\n\nArthur put his hands to his head.\n\n\"Miss Woodward,\" he said pathetically, \"I'm afraid I've gone\ncrazy. Do you see the same things I do?\"\n\nEstelle nodded. Her eyes wide open.\n\n\"What _is_ the matter?\" she asked helplessly.\n\nShe turned again to the window. The square was almost empty once\nmore. The motor-cars still traveling about the streets were going so\nswiftly they were hardly visible. Their speed seemed to increase\nsteadily. Soon it was almost impossible to distinguish them,\nand only a grayish blur marked their paths along Fifth Avenue and\nTwenty-Third Street.\n\nIt grew dusk, and then rapidly dark. As their office was on the\nwestern side of the building they could not see that the sun had\nsunk in the east, but subconsciously they realized that this must\nbe the case.\n\nIn silence they watched the panorama grow black except for the\nstreet-lamps, remain thus for a time, and then suddenly spring into\nbrilliantly illuminated activity.\n\nAgain this lasted for a little while, and the west once more began\nto glow. The sun rose somewhat more hastily from the Jersey hills\nand began to soar overhead, but very soon darkness fell again. With\nhardly an interval the city became illuminated, and then the west\ngrew red once more.\n\n\"Apparently,\" said Arthur, steadying his voice with a conscious\neffort, \"there's been a cataclysm somewhere, the direction of\nthe earth's rotation has been reversed, and its speed immensely\nincreased. It seems to take only about five minutes for a rotation\nnow.\"\n\nAs he spoke darkness fell for the third time. Estelle turned from\nthe window with a white face.\n\n\"What's going to happen?\" she cried.\n\n\"I don't know,\" answered Arthur. \"The scientist fellows tell us\nif the earth were to spin fast enough the centrifugal force would\nthrow us all off into space. Perhaps that's what's going to happen.\"\n\nEstelle sank into a chair and stared at him, appalled. There was a\nsudden explosion behind them. With a start, Estelle jumped to her\nfeet and turned. A little gilt clock over her typewriter-desk lay\nin fragments. Arthur hastily glanced at his own watch.\n\n\"Great bombs and little cannon-balls!\" he shouted. \"Look at this!\"\n\nHis watch trembled and quivered in his hand. The hands were going\naround so swiftly it was impossible to watch the minute-hand,\nand the hour-hand traveled like the wind.\n\nWhile they looked, it made two complete revolutions. In one of\nthem the glory of daylight had waxed, waned, and vanished. In the\nother, darkness reigned except for the glow from the electric\nlight overhead.\n\nThere was a sudden tension and catch in the watch. Arthur dropped\nit instantly. It flew to pieces before it reached the floor.\n\n\"If you've got a watch,\" Arthur ordered swiftly, \"stop it this\ninstant!\"\n\nEstelle fumbled at her wrist. Arthur tore the watch from her hand\nand threw open the case. The machinery inside was going so swiftly\nit was hardly visible; Relentlessly, Arthur jabbed a penholder in\nthe works. There was a sharp click, and the watch was still.\n\nArthur ran to the window. As he reached it the sun rushed up, day\nlasted a moment, there was darkness, and then the sun appeared again.\n\n\"Miss Woodward!\" Arthur ordered suddenly, \"look at the ground!\"\n\nEstelle glanced down. The next time the sun flashed into view\nshe gasped.\n\nThe ground was white with snow!\n\n\"What _has_ happened?\" she demanded, terrified. \"Oh, what _has_\nhappened?\"\n\nArthur fumbled at his chin awkwardly, watching the astonishing\npanorama outside. There was hardly any distinguishing between\nthe times the sun was up and the times it was below now, as the\ndarkness and light followed each other so swiftly the effect was\nthe same as one of the old flickering motion-pictures.\n\nAs Arthur watched, this effect became more pronounced. The tall\nFifth Avenue Building across the way began to disintegrate. In a\nmoment, it seemed, there was only a skeleton there. Then that\nvanished, story by story. A great cavity in the earth appeared,\nand then another building became visible, a smaller, brown-stone,\nunimpressive structure.\n\nWith bulging eyes Arthur stared across the city. Except for the\nflickering, he could see almost clearly now.\n\nHe no longer saw the sun rise and set. There was merely a streak of\nunpleasantly brilliant light across the sky. Bit by bit, building\nby building, the city began to disintegrate and become replaced\nby smaller, dingier buildings. In a little while those began to\ndisappear and leave gaps where they vanished.\n\nArthur strained his eyes and looked far down-town. He saw a forest\nof masts and spars along the waterfront for a moment and when\nhe turned his eyes again to the scenery near him it was almost\nbarren of houses, and what few showed were mean, small residences,\napparently set in the midst of farms and plantations.\n\nEstelle was sobbing.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Chamberlain,\" she cried. \"What is the matter? What has\nhappened?\"\n\nArthur had lost his fear of what their fate would be in his\nabsorbing interest in what he saw. He was staring out of the window,\nwide-eyed, lost in the sight before him. At Estelle's cry, however,\nhe reluctantly left the window and patted her shoulder awkwardly.\n\n\"I don't know how to explain it,\" he said uncomfortably, \"but it's\nobvious that my first surmise was all wrong. The speed of the earth's\nrotation can't have been increased, because if it had to the extent\nwe see, we'd have been thrown off into space long ago. But--have\nyou read anything about the Fourth Dimension?\"\n\nEstelle shook her head hopelessly.\n\n\"Well, then, have you ever read anything by Wells? The 'Time\nMachine,' for instance?\"\n\nAgain she shook her head.\n\n\"I don't know how I'm going to say it so you'll understand, but\ntime is just as much a dimension as length and breadth. From what I\ncan judge, I'd say there has been an earthquake, and the ground has\nsettled a little with our building on it, only instead of settling\ndown toward the center of the earth, or side-wise, it's settled in\nthis fourth dimension.\"\n\n\"But what does that mean?\" asked Estelle uncomprehendingly.\n\n\"If the earth had settled down, we'd have been lower. If it had\nsettled to one side, we'd have been moved one way or another, but as\nit's settled back in the Fourth Dimension, we're going back in time.\"\n\n\"Then--\"\n\n\"We're in a runaway skyscraper, bound for some time back before\nthe discovery of America!\"\n\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\nIt was very still in the office. Except for the flickering outside\neverything seemed very much as usual. The electric light burned\nsteadily, but Estelle was sobbing with fright and Arthur was trying\nvainly to console her.\n\n\"Have I gone crazy?\" she demanded between her sobs.\n\n\"Not unless I've gone mad, too,\" said Arthur soothingly. The\nexcitement had quite a soothing effect upon him. He had ceased to\nfeel afraid, but was simply waiting to see what had happened. \"We're\nway back before the founding of New York now, and still going\nstrong.\"\n\n\"Are you sure that's what has happened?\"\n\n\"If you'll look outside,\" he suggested, \"you'll see the seasons\nfollowing each other in reverse order. One moment the snow covers\nall the ground, then you catch a glimpse of autumn foliage, then\nsummer follows, and next spring.\"\n\nEstelle glanced out of the window and covered her eyes.\n\n\"Not a house,\" she said despairingly. \"Not a building. Nothing,\nnothing, nothing!\"\n\nArthur slipped, his arm about her and patted hers comfortingly.\n\n\"It's all right,\" he reassured her. \"We'll bring up presently,\nand there we'll be. There's nothing to be afraid of.\"\n\nShe rested her head on his shoulder and sobbed hopelessly for\na little while longer, but presently quieted. Then, suddenly,\nrealizing that Arthur's arm was about her and that she was crying\non his shoulder, she sprang away, blushing crimson.\n\nArthur walked to the window.\n\n\"Look there!\" he exclaimed, but it was too late. \"I'll swear to\nit I saw the Half Moon, Hudson's ship,\" he declared excitedly.\n\"We're way back now, and don't seem to be slacking up, either.\"\n\nEstelle came to the window by his side. The rapidly changing scene\nbefore her made her gasp. It was no longer possible to distinguish\nnight from day.\n\nA wavering streak, moving first to the right and then to the left,\nshowed where the sun flashed across the sky.\n\n\"What makes the sun wabble so?\" she asked.\n\n\"Moving north and south of the equator,\" Arthur explained\ncasually. \"When it's farthest south--to the left--there's always\nsnow on the ground. When it's farthest right it's summer. See how\ngreen it is?\"\n\nA few moments' observation corroborated his statement.\n\n\"I'd say,\" Arthur remarked reflectively, \"that it takes about fifteen\nseconds for the sun to make the round trip from farthest north to\nfarthest south.\" He felt his pulse. \"Do you know the normal rate\nof the heart-beat? We can judge time that way. A clock will go\nall to pieces, of course.\"\n\n\"Why did your watch explode--and the clock?\"\n\n\"Running forward in time unwinds a clock, doesn't it?\" asked\nArthur. \"It follows, of course, that when you move it backward in\ntime it winds up. When you move it too far back, you wind it so\ntightly that the spring just breaks to pieces.\"\n\nHe paused a moment, his fingers on his pulse.\n\n\"Yes, it takes about fifteen seconds for all the four seasons to\npass. That means we're going backward in time about four years a\nminute. If we go on at this rate another hour we'll be back in the\ntime of the Northmen, and will be able to tell if they did discover\nAmerica, after all.\"\n\n\"Funny we don't hear any noises,\" Estelle observed. She had caught\nsome of Arthur's calmness.\n\n\"It passes so quickly that though our ears hear it, we don't separate\nthe sounds. If you'll notice, you do hear a sort of humming.\nIt's very high-pitched, though.\"\n\nEstelle listened, but could hear nothing.\n\n\"No matter,\" said Arthur. \"It's probably a little higher than your\nears will catch. Lots of people can't hear a bat squeak.\"\n\n\"I never could,\" said Estelle. \"Out in the country, where I come\nfrom, other people could hear them, but I couldn't.\"\n\nThey stood a while in silence, watching.\n\n\"When are we going to stop?\" asked Estelle uneasily. \"It seems as\nif we're going to keep on indefinitely.\"\n\n\"I guess we'll stop all right,\" Arthur reassured her. \"It's obvious\nthat whatever it was, only affected our own building, or we'd see\nsome other one with us. It looks like a fault or a flaw in the rock\nthe building rests on. And that can only give so far.\"\n\nEstelle was silent for a moment.\n\n\"Oh, I can't be sane!\" she burst out semihysterically. \"This can't\nbe happening!\"\n\n\"You aren't crazy,\" said Arthur sharply. \"You're sane as I am. Just\nsomething queer is happening. Buck up. Say your multiplication\ntables. Say anything you know. Say something sensible and you'll\nknow you're all right. But don't get frightened now. There'll be\nplenty to get frightened about later.\"\n\nThe grimness in his tone alarmed Estelle.\n\n\"What are you afraid of?\" she asked quickly.\n\n\"Time enough to worry when it happens,\" Arthur retorted briefly.\n\n\"You--you aren't afraid we'll go back before the beginning of the\nworld, are you?\" asked Estelle in sudden access of fright.\n\nArthur shook his head.\n\n\"Tell me,\" said Estelle more quietly, getting a grip on herself. \"I\nwon't mind. But please tell me.\"\n\nArthur glanced at her. Her face was pale, but there was more\nresolution in it than he had expected to find.\n\n\"I'll tell you, then,\" he said reluctantly. \"We're going back a\nlittle faster than we were, and the flaw seems to be a deeper one\nthan I thought. At the roughest kind of an estimate, we're all of\na thousand years before the discovery of America now, and I think\nnearer three or four. And we're gaining speed all the time. So,\nthough I am as sure as I can be sure of anything that we'll stop\nthis cave-in eventually, I don't know where. It's like a crevasse\nin the earth opened by an earthquake which may be only a few feet\ndeep, or it may be hundreds of yards, or even a mile or two. We\nstarted off smoothly. We're going at a terrific rate. _What will\nhappen when we stop?_\"\n\nEstelle caught her breath.\n\n\"What?\" she asked quietly.\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Arthur in an irritated tone, to cover his\napprehension. \"How could I know?\"\n\nEstelle turned from him to the window again.\n\n\"Look!\" she said, pointing.\n\nThe flickering had begun again. While they stared, hope springing\nup once more in their hearts, it became more pronounced. Soon they\ncould distinctly see the difference between day and night.\n\nThey were slowing up! The white snow on the ground remained there\nfor an appreciable time, autumn lasted quite a while. They could\ncatch the flashes of the sun as it made its revolutions now,\ninstead of its seeming like a ribbon of fire. At last day lasted\nall of fifteen or twenty minutes.\n\nIt grew longer and longer. Then half an hour, then an hour. The\nsun wavered in midheaven and was still.\n\nFar below them, the watchers in the tower of the skyscraper saw trees\nswaying and bending in the wind. Though there was not a house or a\nhabitation to be seen and a dense forest covered all of Manhattan\nIsland, such of the world as they could see looked normal. Wherever\nor rather in whatever epoch of time they were, they had arrived.\n\n\n\n\nIV.\n\n\nArthur caught at Estelle's arm and the two made a dash for the\nelevators. Fortunately one was standing still, the door open, on\ntheir floor. The elevator-boy had deserted his post and was looking\nwith all the rest of the occupants of the building at the strange\nlandscape that surrounded them.\n\nNo sooner had the pair reached the car, however, than the boy came\nhurrying along the corridor, three or four other people following\nhim also at a run. Without a word the boy rushed inside, the others\ncrowded after him, and the car shot downward, all of the newcomers\npanting from their sprint.\n\nTheirs was the first car to reach the bottom. They rushed out and\nto the western door.\n\nHere, where they had been accustomed to see Madison Square spread\nout before them, a clearing of perhaps half an acre in extent showed\nitself. Where their eyes instinctively looked for the dark bronze\nfountain, near which soap-box orators aforetime held sway, they saw\na tent, a wigwam of hides and bark gaily painted. And before the\nwigwam were two or three brown-skinned Indians, utterly petrified\nwith astonishment.\n\nBehind the first wigwam were others, painted like the first with\ndaubs of brightly colored clay. From them, too, Indians issued,\nand stared in incredulous amazement, their eyes growing wider\nand wider. When the group of white people confronted the Indians\nthere was a moment's deathlike silence. Then, with a wild yell,\nthe redskins broke and ran, not stopping to gather together their\nbelongings, nor pausing for even a second glance at the weird\nstrangers who invaded their domain.\n\nArthur took two or three deep breaths of the fresh air and\nfound himself even then comparing its quality with that of the\ncity. Estelle stared about her with unbelieving eyes. She turned\nand saw the great bulk of the office building behind her, then\nfaced this small clearing with a virgin forest on its farther side.\n\nShe found herself trembling from some undefined cause. Arthur glanced\nat her. He saw the trembling and knew she would have a fit of nerves\nin a moment if something did not come up demanding instant attention.\n\n\"We'd better take a look at this village,\" he said in an off-hand\nvoice. \"We can probably find out how long ago it is from the weapons\nand so on.\"\n\nHe grasped her arm firmly and led her in the direction of the\ntents. The other people, left behind, displayed their emotions in\ndifferent ways. Two or three of them--women--sat frankly down on\nthe steps and indulged in tears of bewilderment, fright and relief\nin a peculiar combination defying analysis. Two or three of the\nmen swore, in shaken voices.\n\nMeantime, the elevators inside the building were rushing and\nclanging, and the hall filled with a white-faced mob, desperately\nanxious to find out what had happened and why. The people poured\nout of the door and stared about blankly. There was a peculiar\nexpression of doubt on every one of their faces. Each one was asking\nhimself if he were awake, and having proved that by pinches, openly\nadministered, the next query was whether they had gone mad.\n\nArthur led Estelle cautiously among the tents.\n\nThe village contained about a dozen wigwams. Most of them were made\nof strips of birch-bark, cleverly overlapping each other, the seams\ncemented with gum. All had hide flaps for doors, and one or two were\nbuilt almost entirely of hides, sewed together with strips of sinew.\n\nArthur made only a cursory examination of the village. His principal\nmotive in taking Estelle there was to give her some mental occupation\nto ward off the reaction from the excitement of the cataclysm.\n\nHe looked into one or two of the tents and found merely couches of\nhides, with minor domestic utensils scattered about. He brought\nfrom one tent a bow and quiver of arrows. The workmanship was good,\nbut very evidently the maker had no knowledge of metal tools.\n\nArthur's acquaintance with archeological subjects was very slight,\nbut he observed that the arrow-heads were chipped, and not rubbed\nsmooth. They were attached to the shafts with strips of gut or\ntendon.\n\nArthur was still pursuing his investigation when a sob from Estelle\nmade him stop and look at her.\n\n\"Oh, what are we going to do?\" she asked tearfully. \"What _are_\nwe going to do? Where are we?\"\n\n\"You mean, _when_ are we,\" Arthur corrected with a grim smile. \"I\ndon't know. Way back before the discovery of America, though. You\ncan see in everything in the village that there isn't a trace\nof European civilization. I suspect that we are several thousand\nyears back. I can't tell, of course, but this pottery makes me\nthink so. See this bowl?\"\n\nHe pointed to a bowl of red clay lying on the ground before one of\nthe wigwams.\n\n\"If you'll look, you'll see that it isn't really pottery at all. It's\na basket that was woven of reeds and then smeared with clay to\nmake it fire-resisting. The people who made that didn't know about\nbaking clay to make it stay put. When America was discovered nearly\nall the tribes knew something about pottery.\"\n\n\"But what are we going to do?\" Estelle tearfully insisted.\n\n\"We're going to muddle along as well as we can,\" answered Arthur\ncheerfully, \"until we can get back to where we started from. Maybe\nthe people back in the twentieth century can send a relief party\nafter us. When the skyscraper vanished it must have left a hole\nof some sort, and it may be possible for them to follow us down.\"\n\n\"If that's so,\" said Estelle quickly, \"why can't we climb up it\nwithout waiting for them to come after us?\"\n\nArthur scratched his head. He looked across the clearing at the\nskyscraper. It seemed to rest very solidly on the ground. He looked\nup. The sky seemed normal.\n\n\"To tell the truth,\" he admitted, \"there doesn't seem to be any\nhole. I said that more to cheer you up than anything else.\"\n\nEstelle clenched her hands tightly and took a grip on herself.\n\n\"Just tell me the truth,\" she said quietly. \"I was rather foolish,\nbut tell me what you honestly think.\"\n\nArthur eyed her keenly.\n\n\"In that case,\" he said reluctantly, \"I'll admit we're in a pretty\nbad fix. I don't know what has happened, how it happened, or anything\nabout it. I'm just going to keep on going until I see a way clear\nto get out of this mess. There are two thousand of us people,\nmore or less, and among all of us we must be able to find a way out.\"\n\nEstelle had turned very pale.\n\n\"We're in no great danger from Indians,\" went on Arthur thoughtfully,\n\"or from anything else that I know of--except one thing.\"\n\n\"What is that?\" asked Estelle quickly.\n\nArthur shook his head and led her back toward the skyscraper, which\nwas now thronged with the people from all the floors who had come\ndown to the ground and were standing excitedly about the concourse\nasking each other what had happened.\n\nArthur led Estelle to one of the corners.\n\n\"Wait for me here,\" he ordered. \"I'm going to talk to this crowd.\"\n\nHe pushed his way through until he could reach the confectionery and\nnews-stand in the main hallway. Here he climbed up on the counter\nand shouted:\n\n\"People, listen to me! I'm going to tell you what's happened!\"\n\nIn an instant there was dead silence. He found himself the center\nof a sea of white faces, every one contorted with fear and anxiety.\n\n\"To begin with,\" he said confidently, \"there's nothing to be afraid\nof. We're going to get back to where we started from! I don't\nknow how, yet, but we'll do it. Don't get frightened. Now I'll\ntell you what's happened.\"\n\nHe rapidly sketched out for them, in words as simple as he could make\nthem, his theory that a flaw in the rock on which the foundations\nrested had developed and let the skyscraper sink, not downward,\nbut into the Fourth Dimension.\n\n\"I'm an engineer,\" he finished. \"What nature can do, we can\nimitate. Nature let us into this hole. We'll climb out. In the\nmean time, matters are serious. We needn't be afraid of not getting\nback. We'll do that. What we've got to fight is--starvation!\"\n\n\n\n\nV.\n\n\n\"We've got to fight starvation, and we've got to beat it,\" Arthur\ncontinued doggedly. \"I'm telling you this right at the outset,\nbecause I want you to begin right at the beginning and pitch in to\nhelp. We have very little food and a lot of us to eat it. First,\nI want some volunteers to help with rationing. Next, I want every\nounce of food, in this place put under guard where it can be served\nto those who need it most. Who will help out with this?\"\n\nThe swift succession of shocks had paralyzed the faculties of most\nof the people there, but half a dozen moved forward. Among them was\na single gray-haired man with an air of accustomed authority. Arthur\nrecognized him as the president of the bank on the ground floor.\n\n\"I don't know who you are or if you're right in saying what has\nhappened,\" said the gray-haired man. \"But I see something's got to\nbe done, and--well, for the time being I'll take your word for what\nthat is. Later on we'll thrash this matter out.\"\n\nArthur nodded. He bent over and spoke in a low voice to the\ngray-haired man, who moved away.\n\n\"Grayson, Walters, Terhune, Simpson, and Forsythe come here,\"\nthe gray-haired man called at a doorway.\n\nA number of men began to press dazedly toward him. Arthur resumed\nhis harangue.\n\n\"You people--those of you who aren't too dazed to think--are\nremembering there's a restaurant in the building and no need to\nstarve. You're wrong. There are nearly two thousand of us here. That\nmeans six thousand meals a day. We've got to have nearly ten tons\nof food a day, and we've got to have it at once.\"\n\n\"Hunt?\" some one suggested.\n\n\"I saw Indians,\" some one else shouted. \"Can we trade with them?\"\n\n\"We can hunt and we can trade with the Indians,\" Arthur admitted,\n\"but we need food by the ton--by the ton, people! The Indians don't\nstore up supplies, and, besides, they're much too scattered to have\na surplus for us. But we've got to have food. Now, how many of you\nknow anything about hunting, fishing, trapping, or any possible\nway of getting food?\"\n\nThere were a few hands raised--pitifully few. Arthur saw Estelle's\nhand up.\n\n\"Very well,\" he said. \"Those of you who raised your hands then\ncome with me up on the second floor and we'll talk it over.\nThe rest of you try to conquer your fright, and don't go outside\nfor a while. We've got some things to attend to before it will\nbe quite safe for you to venture out. And keep away from the\nrestaurant. There are armed guards over that food. Before we pass\nit out indiscriminately, we'll see to it there's more for to-morrow\nand the next day.\"\n\nHe stepped down from the counter and moved toward the stairway. It\nwas not worth while to use the elevator for the ride of only one\nfloor. Estelle managed to join him, and they mounted the steps\ntogether.\n\n\"Do you think we'll pull through all right?\" she asked quietly.\n\n\"We've got to!\" Arthur told her, setting his chin firmly. \"We've\nsimply got to.\"\n\nThe gray-haired president of the bank was waiting for them at the\ntop of the stairs.\n\n\"My name is Van Deventer,\" he said, shaking hands with Arthur,\nwho gave his own name.\n\n\"Where shall our emergency council sit?\" he asked.\n\n\"The bank has a board room right over the safety vault. I dare say we\ncan accommodate everybody there--everybody in the council, anyway.\"\n\nArthur followed into the board-room, and the others trooped in\nafter him.\n\n\"I'm just assuming temporary leadership,\" Arthur explained, \"because\nit's imperative some things be done at once. Later on we can talk\nabout electing officials to direct our activities. Right now we\nneed food. How many of you can shoot?\"\n\nAbout a quarter of the hands were raised. Estelle's was among\nthe number.\n\n\"And how many are fishermen?\"\n\nA few more went up.\n\n\"What do the rest of you do?\"\n\nThere was a chorus of \"gardener,\" \"I have a garden in my yard,\"\n\"I grow peaches in New Jersey,\" and three men confessed that they\nraised chickens as a hobby.\n\n\"We'll want you gardeners in a little while. Don't go yet. But the\nmost important are huntsmen and fishermen. Have any of you weapons\nin your offices?\"\n\nA number had revolvers, but only one man had a shotgun and shells.\n\n\"I was going on my vacation this afternoon straight from the office,\"\nhe explained, \"and have all my vacation tackle.\"\n\n\"Good man!\" Arthur exclaimed. \"You'll go after the heavy game.\"\n\n\"With a shotgun?\" the sportsman asked, aghast.\n\n\"If you get close to them a shotgun will do as well as anything,\nand we can't waste a shell on every bird or rabbit. Those shells of\nyours are precious. You other fellows will have to turn fishermen\nfor a while. Your pistols are no good for hunting.\"\n\n\"The watchmen at the bank have riot guns,\" said Van Deventer,\n\"and there are one or two repeating-rifles there. I don't know\nabout ammunition.\"\n\n\"Good! I don't mean about the ammunition, but about the guns. We'll\nhope for the ammunition. You fishermen get to work to improvise\ntackle out of anything you can get hold of. Will you do that?\"\n\nA series of nods answered his question.\n\n\"Now for the gardeners. You people will have to roam through the\nwoods in company with the hunters and locate anything in the way of\nedibles that grows. Do all of you know what wild plants look like?\nI mean wild fruits and vegetables that are good to eat.\"\n\nA few of them nodded, but the majority looked dubious. The consensus\nof opinion seemed to be that they would try. Arthur seemed a little\ndiscouraged.\n\n\"I guess you're the man to tell about the restaurant,\" Van Deventer\nsaid quietly. \"And as this is the food commission, or something of\nthat sort, everybody here will be better for hearing it. Anyway,\neverybody will have to know it before night. I took over the\nrestaurant as you suggested, and posted some of the men from the\nbank that I knew I could trust about the doors. But there was\nhardly any use in doing it.\"\n\n\"The restaurant stocks up in the afternoon, as most of its\nbusiness is in the morning and at noon. It only carries a day's\nstock of foodstuffs, and the--the cataclysm, or whatever it was,\ncame at three o'clock. There is practically nothing in the place.\nWe couldn't make sandwiches for half the women that are caught\nwith us, let alone the men. Everybody will go hungry to-night.\nThere will be no breakfast to-morrow, nor anything to eat until we\neither make arrangements with the Indians for some supplies or else\nget food for ourselves.\"\n\nArthur leaned his jaw on his hand and considered. A slow flush\ncrept over his cheek. He was getting his fighting blood up.\n\nAt school, when he began to flush slowly his schoolmates had known\nthe symptom and avoided his wrath. Now he was growing angry with\nmere circumstances, but it would be none the less unfortunate for\nthose circumstances.\n\n\"Well,\" he said at last deliberately, \"we've got to-- What's that?\"\n\nThere was a great creaking and groaning. Suddenly a sort of\nvibration was felt under foot. The floor began to take on a slight\nslant.\n\n\"Great Heaven!\" some one cried. \"The building's turning over and\nwe'll be buried in the ruins!\"\n\nThe tilt of the floor became more pronounced. An empty chair slid\nto one end of the room. There was a crash.\n\n\n\n\nVI.\n\n\nArthur woke to find some one tugging at his shoulders, trying to drag\nhim from beneath the heavy table, which had wedged itself across\nhis feet and pinned him fast, while a flying chair had struck him\non the head and knocked him unconscious.\n\n\"Oh, come and help,\" Estelle's voice was calling\ndeliberately. \"Somebody come and help! He's caught in here!\"\n\nShe was sobbing in a combination of panic and some unknown emotion.\n\n\"Help me, please!\" she gasped, then her voice broke despondently,\nbut she never ceased to tug ineffectually at Chamberlain, trying\nto drag him out of the mass of wreckage.\n\nArthur moved a little, dazedly.\n\n\"Are you alive?\" she called anxiously. \"Are you alive? Hurry, oh,\nhurry and wriggle out. The building's falling to pieces!\"\n\n\"I'm all right,\" Arthur said weakly. \"You get out before it all\ncomes down.\"\n\n\"I won't leave you,\" she declared \"Where are you caught? Are you\nbadly hurt? Hurry, please hurry!\"\n\nArthur stirred, but could not loosen his feet. He half-rolled over,\nand the table moved as if it had been precariously balanced, and slid\nheavily to one side. With Estelle still tugging at him, he managed\nto get to his feet on the slanting floor and stared about him.\n\nArthur continued to stare about.\n\n\"No danger,\" he said weakly. \"Just the floor of the one room gave\nway. The aftermath of the rock-flaw.\"\n\nHe made his way across the splintered flooring and piled-up chairs.\n\n\"We're on top of the safe-deposit vault,\" he said. \"That's why\nwe didn't fall all the way to the floor below. I wonder how we're\ngoing to get down?\"\n\nEstelle followed him, still frightened for fear of the building\nfalling upon them. Some of the long floor-boards stretched over\nthe edge of the vault and rested on a tall, bronze grating that\nprotected the approach to the massive strong-box. Arthur tested\nthem with his foot.\n\n\"They seem to be pretty solid,\" he said tentatively.\n\nHis strength was coming back to him every moment. He had been no\nmore than stunned. He walked out on the planking to the bronze\ngrating and turned.\n\n\"If you don't get dizzy, you might come on,\" he said. \"We can swing\ndown the grille here to the floor.\"\n\nEstelle followed gingerly and in a moment they were safely below. The\ncorridor was quite empty.\n\n\"When the crash came,\" Estelle explained, her voice shaking with\nthe reaction from her fear of a moment ago, \"every one thought the\nbuilding was coming to pieces, and ran out. I'm afraid they've all\nrun away.\"\n\n\"They'll be back in a little while,\" Arthur said quietly.\n\nThey went along the big marble corridor to the same western door,\nout of which they had first gone to see the Indian village. As\nthey emerged into the sunlight they met a few of the people who\nhad already recovered from their panic and were returning.\n\nA crowd of respectable size gathered in a few moments, all still\npale and shaken, but coming back to the building which was their\nrefuge. Arthur leaned wearily against the cold stone. It seemed to\nvibrate under his touch. He turned quickly to Estelle.\n\n\"Feel this,\" he exclaimed.\n\nShe did so.\n\n\"I've been wondering what that rumble was,\" she said. \"I've been\nhearing it ever since we landed here, but didn't understand where\nit came from.\"\n\n\"You hear a rumble?\" Arthur asked, puzzled. \"I can't hear anything.\"\n\n\"It isn't as loud as it was, but I hear it,\" Estelle insisted. \"It's\nvery deep, like the lowest possible bass note of an organ.\"\n\n\"You couldn't hear the shrill whistle when we were coming here,\"\nArthur exclaimed suddenly, \"and you can't hear the squeak of a\nbat. Of course your ears are pitched lower than usual, and you can\nhear sounds that are lower than I can hear. Listen carefully. Does\nit sound in the least like a liquid rushing through somewhere?\"\n\n\"Y-yes,\" said Estelle hesitatingly. \"Somehow, I don't quite\nunderstand how, it gives me the impression of a tidal flow or\nsomething of that sort.\"\n\nArthur rushed indoors. When Estelle followed him she found him\nexcitedly examining the marble floor about the base of the vault.\n\n\"It's cracked,\" he said excitedly. \"It's cracked! The vault rose\nall of an inch!\"\n\nEstelle looked and saw the cracks.\n\n\"What does that mean?\"\n\n\"It means we're going to get back where we belong,\" Arthur cried\njubilantly. \"It means I'm on the track of the whole trouble.\nIt means everything's going to be all right.\"\n\nHe prowled about the vault exultantly, noting exactly how the cracks\nin the flooring ran and seeing in each a corroboration of his theory.\n\n\"I'll have to make some inspections in the cellar,\" he went on\nhappily, \"but I'm nearly sure I'm on the right track and can figure\nout a corrective.\"\n\n\"How soon can we hope to start back?\" asked Estelle eagerly.\n\nArthur hesitated, then a great deal of the excitement ebbed from\nhis face, leaving it rather worried and stern.\n\n\"It may be a month, or two months, or a year,\" he answered\ngravely. \"I don't know. If the first thing I try will work, it\nwon't be long. If we have to experiment, I daren't guess how long\nwe may be. But\"--his chin set firmly--\"we're going to get back.\"\n\nEstelle looked at him speculatively. Her own expression grew a\nlittle worried, too.\n\n\"But in a month,\" she said dubiously, \"we--there is hardly any hope\nof our finding food for two thousand people for a month, is there?\"\n\n\"We've got to,\" Arthur declared. \"We can't hope to get that much\nfood from the Indians. It will be days before they'll dare to come\nback to their village, if they ever come. It will be weeks before\nwe can hope to have them earnestly at work to feed us, and that's\nleaving aside the question of how we'll communicate with them, and\nhow we'll manage to trade with them. Frankly, I think everybody is\ngoing to have to draw his belt tight before we get through--if we\ndo. Some of us will get along, anyway.\"\n\nEstelle's eyes opened wide as the meaning of his last sentence\npenetrated her mind.\n\n\"You mean--that all of us won't--\"\n\n\"I'm going to take care of you,\" Arthur said gravely, \"but there\nare liable to be lively doings around here when people begin to\nrealize they're really in a tight fix for food. I'm going to get\nVan Deventer to help me organize a police band to enforce martial\nlaw. We mustn't have any disorder, that's certain, and I don't\ntrust a city-bred man in a pinch unless I know him.\"\n\nHe stooped and picked up a revolver from the floor, left there\nby one of the bank watchmen when he fled, in the belief that the\nbuilding was falling.\n\n\n\n\nVII.\n\n\nArthur stood at the window of his office and stared out toward the\nwest. The sun was setting, but upon what a scene!\n\nWhere, from this same window Arthur had seen the sun setting behind\nthe Jersey hills, all edged with the angular roofs of factories,\nwith their chimneys emitting columns of smoke, he now saw the same\nsun sinking redly behind a mass of luxuriant foliage. And where\nhe was accustomed to look upon the tops of high buildings--each\nentitled to the name of \"skyscraper\"--he now saw miles and miles\nof waving green branches.\n\nThe wide Hudson flowed on placidly, all unruffled by the arrival of\nthis strange monument upon its shores--the same Hudson Arthur knew\nas a busy thoroughfare of puffing steamers and chugging launches.\nTwo or three small streams wandered unconcernedly across the land\nthat Arthur had known as the most closely built-up territory on\nearth. And far, far below him--Arthur had to lean well out of his\nwindow to see it--stood a collection of tiny wigwams. Those small\nbark structures represented the original metropolis of New York.\n\nHis telephone rang. Van Deventer was on the wire. The exchange in\nthe building was still working. Van Deventer wanted Arthur to come\ndown to his private office. There were still a great many things to\nbe settled--the arrangements for commandeering offices for sleeping\nquarters for the women, and numberless other details. The men who\nseemed to have best kept their heads were gathering there to settle\nupon a course of action.\n\nArthur glanced out of the window again before going to the\nelevator. He saw a curiously compact dark cloud moving swiftly\nacross the sky to the west.\n\n\"Miss Woodward,\" he said sharply, \"What is that?\"\n\nEstelle came to the window and looked.\n\n\"They are birds,\" she told him. \"Birds flying in a group. I've\noften seen them in the country, though never as many as that.\"\n\n\"How do you catch birds?\" Arthur asked her. \"I know about shooting\nthem, and so on, but we haven't guns enough to count. Could we\ncatch them in traps, do you think?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't be surprised,\" said Estelle thoughtfully. \"But it would\nbe hard to catch many.\"\n\n\"Come down-stairs,\" directed Arthur. \"You know as much as any of\nthe men here, and more than most, apparently. We're going to make\nyou show us how to catch things.\"\n\nEstelle smiled, a trifle wanly. Arthur led the way to the\nelevator. In the car he noticed that she looked distressed.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" he asked. \"You aren't really frightened,\nare you?\"\n\n\"No,\" she answered shakily, \"but--I'm rather upset about this\nthing. It's so--so terrible, somehow, to be back here, thousands\nof miles, or years, away from all one's friends and everybody.\"\n\n\"Please\"--Arthur smiled encouragingly at her--\"please count me your\nfriend, won't you?\"\n\nShe nodded, but blinked back some tears. Arthur would have tried to\nhearten her further, but the elevator stopped at their floor. They\nwalked into the room where the meeting of cool heads was to take\nplace.\n\nNo more than a dozen men were in there talking earnestly but\ndispiritedly. When Arthur and Estelle entered Van Deventer came\nover to greet them.\n\n\"We've got to do something,\" he said in a low voice. \"A wave of\nhomesickness has swept over the whole place. Look at those men. Every\none is thinking about his family and contrasting his cozy fireside\nwith all that wilderness outside.\"\n\n\"You don't seem to be worried,\" Arthur observed with a smile.\n\nVan Deventer's eyes twinkled.\n\n\"I'm a bachelor,\" he said cheerfully, \"and I live in a hotel. I've\nbeen longing for a chance to see some real excitement for thirty\nyears. Business has kept me from it up to now, but I'm enjoying\nmyself hugely.\"\n\nEstelle looked at the group of dispirited men.\n\n\"We'll simply have to do something,\" she said with a shaky smile. \"I\nfeel just as they do. This morning I hated the thought of having\nto go back to my boarding-house to-night, but right now I feel as\nif the odor of cabbage in the hallway would seem like heaven.\"\n\nArthur led the way to the flat-topped desk in the middle of the room.\n\n\"Let's settle a few of the more important matters,\" he said in\na businesslike tone. \"None of us has any authority to act for\nthe rest of the people in the tower, but so many of us are in a\nstate of blue funk that those who are here must have charge for a\nwhile. Anybody any suggestions?\"\n\n\"Housing,\" answered Van Deventer promptly. \"I suggest that we draft\na gang of men to haul all the upholstered settees and rugs that\nare to be found to one floor, for the women to sleep on.\"\n\n\"M--m. Yes. That's a good idea. Anybody a better plan?\"\n\nNo one spoke. They all still looked much too homesick to take any\ngreat interest in anything, but they began to listen more or less\nhalf-heartedly.\n\n\"I've been thinking about coal,\" said Arthur. \"There's undoubtedly\na supply in the basement, but I wonder if it wouldn't be well to\ncut the lights off most of the floors, only lighting up the ones\nwe're using.\"\n\n\"That might be a good idea later,\" Estelle said quietly, \"but light\nis cheering, somehow, and every one feels so blue that I wouldn't\ndo it to-night. To-morrow they'll begin to get up their resolution\nagain, and you can ask them to do things.\"\n\n\"If we're going to starve to death,\" one of the other men said\ngloomily, \"we might as well have plenty of light to do it by.\"\n\n\"We aren't going to starve to death,\" retorted Arthur sharply. \"Just\nbefore I came down I saw a great cloud of birds, greater than I\nhad ever seen before. When we get at those birds--\"\n\n\"When,\" echoed the gloomy one.\n\n\"They were pigeons,\" Estelle explained. \"They shouldn't be hard\nto snare or trap.\"\n\n\"I usually have my dinner before now,\" the gloomy one protested,\n\"and I'm told I won't get anything to-night.\"\n\nThe other men began to straighten their shoulders. The peevishness\nof one of their number seemed to bring out their latent courage.\n\n\"Well, we've got to stand it for the present,\" one of them said\nalmost philosophically. \"What I'm most anxious about is getting\nback. Have we any chance?\"\n\nArthur nodded emphatically.\n\n\"I think so. I have a sort of idea as to the cause of our sinking\ninto the Fourth Dimension, and when that is verified, a corrective\ncan be looked for and applied.\"\n\n\"How long will that take?\"\n\n\"Can't say,\" Arthur replied frankly. \"I don't know what tools,\nwhat materials, or what workmen we have, and what's rather more to\nthe point, I don't even know what work will have to be done. The\npressing problem is food.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother the food,\" some one protested impatiently. \"I don't\ncare about myself. I can go hungry to-night. I want to get back to\nmy family.\"\n\n\"That's all that really matters,\" a chorus of voices echoed.\n\n\"We'd better not bother about anything else unless we find we\ncan't get back. Concentrate on getting back,\" one man stated more\nexplicitly.\n\n\"Look here,\" said Arthur incisively. \"You've a family, and so have a\ngreat many of the others in the tower, but your family and everybody\nelse's family has got to wait. As an inside limit, we can hope to\nbegin to work on the problem of getting back when we're sure there's\nnothing else going to happen. I tell you quite honestly that I think\nI know what is the direct cause of this catastrophe. And I'll tell\nyou even more honestly that I think I'm the only man among us who\ncan put this tower back where it started from. And I'll tell you\nmost honestly of all that any attempt to meddle at this present time\nwith the forces that let us down here will result in a catastrophe\nconsiderably greater than the one that happened to-day.\"\n\n\"Well, if you're sure--\" some one began reluctantly.\n\n\"I am so sure that I'm going to keep to myself the knowledge of what\nwill start those forces to work again,\" Arthur said quietly. \"I\ndon't want any impatient meddling. If we start them too soon God\nonly knows what will happen.\"\n\n\n\n\nVIII.\n\n\nVan Deventer was eying Arthur Chamberlain keenly.\n\n\"It isn't a question of your wanting pay in exchange for your\nservices in putting us back, is it?\" he asked coolly.\n\nArthur turned and faced him. His face began to flush slowly. Van\nDeventer put up one hand.\n\n\"I beg your pardon. I see.\"\n\n\"We aren't settling the things we came here for,\" Estelle\ninterrupted.\n\nShe had noted the threat of friction and hastened to put in a\ndiversion. Arthur relaxed.\n\n\"I think that as a beginning,\" he suggested, \"we'd better get\nsleeping arrangements completed. We can get everybody together\nsomewhere, I dare say, and then secure volunteers for the work.\"\n\n\"Right.\" Van Deventer was anxious to make amends for his blunder\nof a moment before. \"Shall I send the bank watchmen to go on each\nfloor in turn and ask everybody to come down-stairs?\"\n\n\"You might start them,\" Arthur said. \"It will take a long time\nfor every one to assemble.\"\n\nVan Deventer spoke into the telephone on his desk. In a moment he\nhung up the receiver.\n\n\"They're on their way,\" he said.\n\nArthur was frowning to himself and scribbling in a note-book.\n\n\"Of course,\" he announced abstractedly, \"the pressing problem\nis food. We've quite a number of fishermen, and a few hunters.\nWe've got to have a lot of food at once, and everything considered,\nI think we'd better count on the fishermen. At sunrise we'd better\nhave some people begin to dig bait and wake our anglers. They'd\nbetter make their tackle to-night, don't you think?\"\n\nThere was a general nod.\n\n\"We'll announce that, then. The fishermen will go to the river under\nguard of the men we have who can shoot. I think what Indians there\nare will be much too frightened to try to ambush any of us, but we'd\nbetter be on the safe side. They'll keep together and fish at nearly\nthe same spot, with our hunters patrolling the woods behind them,\ntaking pot-shots at game, if they see any. The fishermen should make\nmore or less of a success, I think. The Indians weren't extensive\nfishers that I ever heard of, and the river ought fairly to swarm\nwith fish.\"\n\nHe closed his note-book.\n\n\"How many weapons can we count on altogether?\" Arthur asked Van\nDeventer.\n\n\"In the bank, about a dozen riot-guns and half a dozen repeating\nrifles. Elsewhere I don't know. Forty or fifty men said they had\nrevolvers, though.\"\n\n\"We'll give revolvers to the men who go with the fishermen. The\nIndians haven't heard firearms and will run at the report, even if\nthey dare attack our men.\"\n\n\"We can send out the gun-armed men as hunters,\" some one suggested,\n\"and send gardeners with them to look for vegetables and such\nthings.\"\n\n\"We'll have to take a sort of census, really,\" Arthur suggested,\n\"finding what every one can do and getting him to do it.\"\n\n\"I never planned anything like this before,\" Van Deventer remarked,\n\"and I never thought I should, but this is much more fun than\nrunning a bank.\"\n\nArthur smiled.\n\n\"Let's go and have our meeting,\" he said cheerfully.\n\nBut the meeting was a gloomy and despairing affair. Nearly every\none had watched the sun set upon a strange, wild landscape. Hardly\nan individual among the whole two thousand of them had ever been\nout of sight of a house before in his or her life. To look out\nat a vast, untouched wilderness where hitherto they had seen the\nmost highly civilized city on the globe would have been startling\nand depressing enough in itself, but to know that they were alone\nin a whole continent of savages and that there was not, indeed,\nin all the world a single community of people they could greet as\nbrothers was terrifying.\n\nFew of them thought so far, but there was actually--if Arthur's\nestimate of several thousand years' drop back through time was\ncorrect--there was actually no other group of English-speaking people\nin the world. The English language was yet to be invented. Even\nRome, the synonym for antiquity of culture, might still be an\nobscure village inhabited by a band of tatterdemalions under the\nleadership of an upstart Romulus.\n\nSoft in body as these people were, city-bred and unaccustomed to\nface other than the most conventionalized emergencies of life, they\nwere terrified. Hardly one of them had even gone without a meal in\nall his life. To have the prospect of having to earn their food,\nnot by the manipulation of figures in a book, or by expert juggling\nof profits and prices, but by literal wresting of that food from its\nsource in the earth or stream was a really terrifying thing for them.\n\nIn addition, every one of them was bound to the life of modern\ntimes by a hundred ties. Many of them had families, a thousand years\naway. All had interests, engrossing interests, in modern New York.\n\nOne young man felt an anxiety that was really ludicrous because\nhe had promised to take his sweetheart to the theater that night,\nand if he did not come she would be very angry. Another was to have\nbeen married in a week. Some of the people were, like Van Deventer\nand Arthur, so situated that they could view the episode as an\nadventure, or, like Estelle, who had no immediate fear because\nall her family was provided for without her help and lived far\nfrom New York, so they would not learn of the catastrophe for\nsome time. Many, however, felt instant and pressing fear for the\nfamilies whose expenses ran always so close to their incomes that\nthe disappearance of the breadwinner for a week would mean actual\nwant or debt. There are very many such families in New York.\n\nThe people, therefore, that gathered hopelessly at the call of Van\nDeventer's watchmen were dazed and spiritless. Their excitement\nafter Arthur's first attempt to explain the situation to them had\nevaporated. They were no longer keyed up to a high pitch by the\nstartling thing that had happened to them.\n\nNevertheless, although only half comprehending what had actually\noccurred, they began to realize what that occurrence meant.\nNo matter where they might go over the whole face of the globe,\nthey would always be aliens and strangers. If they had been carried\naway to some unknown shore, some wilderness far from their own\nland, they might have thought of building ships to return to their\nhomes. They had seen New York vanish before their eyes, however.\nThey had seen their civilization disappear while they watched.\n\nThey were in a barbarous world. There was not, for example,\na single sulfur match on the whole earth except those in the\nrunaway skyscraper.\n\n\n\n\nIX.\n\n\nArthur and Van Deventer, in turn with the others of the cooler\nheads, thundered at the apathetic people, trying to waken them\nto the necessity for work. They showered promises of inevitable\nreturn to modern times, they pledged their honor to the belief that\na way would ultimately be found by which they would all yet find\nthemselves safely back home again.\n\nThe people, however, had seen New York disintegrate, and Arthur's\nexplanation sounded like some wild dream of an imaginative\nnovelist. Not one person in all the gathering could actually realize\nthat his home might yet be waiting for him, though at the same time\nhe felt a pathetic anxiety for the welfare of its inmates.\n\nEvery one was in a turmoil of contradictory beliefs. On the one hand\nthey knew that all of New York could not be actually destroyed and\nreplaced by a splendid forest in the space of a few hours, so the\naccident or catastrophe must have occurred to those in the tower,\nand on the other hand, they had seen all of New York vanish by\nbits and fragments, to be replaced by a smaller and dingier town,\nhad beheld that replaced in turn, and at last had landed in the\nmidst of this forest.\n\nEvery one, too, began to feel am unusual and uncomfortable sensation\nof hunger. It was a mild discomfort as yet, but few of them had\nexperienced it before without an immediate prospect of assuaging the\ncraving, and the knowledge that there was no food to be had somehow\nincreased the desire for it. They were really in a pitiful state.\n\nVan Deventer spoke encouragingly, and then asked for volunteers for\nimmediate work. There was hardly any response. Every one seemed\nsunk in despondency. Arthur then began to talk straight from the\nshoulder and succeeded in rousing them a little, but every one was\nstill rather too frightened to realize that work could help at all.\n\nIn desperation the dozen or so men who had gathered in Van Deventer's\noffice went about among the gathering and simply selected men at\nrandom, ordering them to follow and begin work. This began to awaken\nthe crowd, but they wakened to fear rather than resolution. They\nwere city-bred, and unaccustomed to face the unusual or the alarming.\n\nArthur noted the new restlessness, but attributed it to growing\nuneasiness rather than selfish panic. He was rather pleased that they\nwere outgrowing their apathy. When the meeting had come to an end he\nfelt satisfied that by morning the latent resolution among the people\nwould have crystallized and they would be ready to work earnestly\nand intelligently on whatever tasks they were directed to undertake.\n\nHe returned to the ground floor of the building feeling much more\nhopeful than before. Two thousand people all earnestly working\nfor one end are hard to down even when faced with such a task as\nconfronted the inhabitants of the runaway skyscraper. Even if they\nwere never able to return to modern times they would still be able\nto form a community that might do much to hasten the development\nof civilization in other parts of the world.\n\nHis hope received a rude shock when he reached the great hallway on\nthe lower floor. There was a fruit and confectionery stand here, and\nas Arthur arrived at the spot, he saw a surging mass of men about it.\nThe keeper of the stand looked frightened, but was selling off his\nstock as fast as he could make change. Arthur forced his way to\nthe counter.\n\n\"Here,\" he said sharply to the keeper of the stand, \"stop selling\nthis stuff. It's got to be held until we can dole it out where\nit's needed.\"\n\n\"I--I can't help myself,\" the keeper said. \"They're takin'\nit anyway.\"\n\n\"Get back there,\" Arthur cried to the crowd. \"Do you call this\ndecent, trying to get more than your share of this stuff? You'll get\nyour portion to-morrow. It is going to be divided up.\"\n\n\"Go to hell!\" some one panted. \"You c'n starve if you want to,\nbut I'm goin' to look out f'r myself.\"\n\nThe men were not really starving, but had been put into a panic by\nthe plain speeches of Arthur and his helpers, and were seizing what\nedibles they could lay hands upon in preparation for the hunger\nthey had been warned to expect.\n\nArthur pushed against the mob, trying to thrust them away from the\ncounter, but his very effort intensified their panic. There was a\nquick surge and a crash. The glass front of the showcase broke in.\n\nIn a flash of rage Arthur struck out viciously. The crowd paid\nnot the slightest attention to him, however. Every man was too\npanic-stricken, and too intent on getting some of this food before\nit was all gone to bother with him.\n\nArthur was simply crushed back by the bodies of the forty or fifty\nmen. In a moment he found himself alone amid the wreckage of the\nstand, with the keeper wringing his hands over the remnants of\nhis goods.\n\nVan Deventer ran down the stairs.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" he demanded as he saw Arthur nursing a bleeding\nhand cut on the broken glass of the showcase.\n\n\"Bolsheviki!\" answered Arthur with a grim smile. \"We woke up some\nof the crowd too successfully. They got panic-stricken and started\nto buy out this stuff here. I tried to stop them, and you see what\nhappened. We'd better look to the restaurant, though I doubt if\nthey'll try anything else just now.\"\n\nHe followed Van Deventer up to the restaurant floor. There were\npicked men before the door, but just as Arthur and the bank president\nappeared two or three white-faced men went up to the guards and\nstarted low-voiced conversations.\n\nArthur reached the spot in time to forestall bribery.\n\nArthur collared one man, Van Deventer another, and in a moment the\ntwo were sent reeling down the hallway.\n\n\"Some fools have got panic-stricken!\" Van Deventer explained to\nthe men before the doors in a casual voice, though he was breathing\nheavily from the unaccustomed exertion. \"They've smashed up the\nfruit-stand on the ground floor and stolen the contents. It's nothing\nbut blue funk! Only, if any of them start to gather around here,\nhit them first and talk it over afterward. You'll do that?\"\n\n\"We will!\" the men said heartily.\n\n\"Shall we use our guns?\" asked another hopefully.\n\nVan Deventer grinned.\n\n\"No,\" he replied, \"we haven't any excuse for that yet. But you might\nshoot at the ceiling, if they get excited. They're just frightened!\"\n\nHe took Arthur's arm, and the two walked toward the stairway again.\n\n\"Chamberlain,\" he said happily, \"tell me why I've never had as much\nfun as this before!\"\n\nArthur smiled a bit wearily.\n\n\"I'm glad you're enjoying yourself!\" he said. \"I'm not. I'm going\noutside and walk around. I want to see if any cracks have appeared\nin the earth anywhere. It's dark, and I'll borrow a lantern down\nin the fire-room, but I want to find out if there are any more\ndevelopments in the condition of the building.\"\n\n\n\n\nX.\n\n\nDespite his preoccupation with his errand, which was to find if\nthere were other signs of the continued activity of the strange\nforces that had lowered the tower through the Fourth Dimension\ninto the dim and unrecorded years of aboriginal America, Arthur\ncould not escape the fascination of the sight that met his eyes. A\nbright moon shone overhead and silvered the white sides of the tower,\nwhile the brightly-lighted windows of the offices within glittered\nlike jewels set into the shining shaft.\n\nFrom his position on the ground he looked into the dimness of the\nforest on all sides. Black obscurity had gathered beneath the dark\nmasses of moonlit foliage. The tiny birch-bark teepees of the now\ndeserted Indian village glowed palely. Above, the stars looked\ncalmly down at the accusing finger of the tower pointing upward,\nas if in reproach at their indifference to the savagery that reigned\nover the whole earth.\n\nLike a fairy tower of jewels the building rose. Alone among a\nwilderness of trees and streams it towered in a strange beauty:\nmoonlit to silver, lighted from within to a mass of brilliant gems,\nit stood serenely still.\n\nArthur, carrying his futile lantern about its base, felt his own\ninsignificance as never before. He wondered what the Indians must\nthink. He knew there must be hundreds of eyes fixed upon the strange\nsight--fixed in awe-stricken terror or superstitious reverence upon\nthis unearthly visitor to their hunting grounds.\n\nA tiny figure, dwarfed by the building whose base he skirted,\nArthur moved slowly about the vast pile. The earth seemed not to\nhave been affected by the vast weight of the tower.\n\nArthur knew, however, that long concrete piles reached far down to\nbedrock. It was these piles that had sunk into the Fourth Dimension,\ncarrying the building with them.\n\nArthur had followed the plans with great interest when the\nMetropolitan was constructed. It was an engineering feat, and in\nthe engineering periodicals, whose study was a part of Arthur's\nbusiness, great space had been given to the building and the methods\nof its construction.\n\nWhile examining the earth carefully he went over his theory of the\ncause for the catastrophe. The whole structure must have sunk at\nthe same time, or it, too, would have disintegrated, as the other\nbuildings had appeared to disintegrate. Mentally, Arthur likened\nthe submergence of the tower in the oceans of time to an elevator\nsinking past the different floors of an office building. All about\nthe building the other sky-scrapers of New York had seemed to\nvanish. In an elevator, the floors one passes seem to rise upward.\n\nCarrying out the analogy to its logical end, Arthur reasoned that the\nbuilding itself had no more cause to disintegrate, as the buildings\nit passed seemed to disintegrate, than the elevator in the office\nbuilding would have cause to rise because its surroundings seemed\nto rise.\n\nWithin the building, he knew, there were strange stirrings of\nemotions. Queer currents of panic were running about, throwing\nthe people to and fro as leaves are thrown about by a current of\nwind. Yet, underneath all those undercurrents of fear, was a rapidly\ngrowing resolution, strengthened by an increasing knowledge of the\nneed to work.\n\nMen were busy even then shifting all possible comfortable furniture\nto a single story for the women in the building to occupy. The\nmen would sleep on the floor for the present. Beds of boughs could\nbe improvised on the morrow. At sunrise on the following morning\nmany men would go to the streams to fish, guarded by other men. All\nwould be frightened, no doubt, but there would be a grim resolution\nunderneath the fear. Other men would wander about to hunt.\n\nThere was little likelihood of Indians approaching for some days, at\nleast, but when they did come Arthur meant to avoid hostilities by\nall possible means. The Indians would be fearful of their strange\nvisitors, and it should not be difficult to convince them that\nfriendliness was safest, even if they displayed unfriendly desires.\n\nThe pressing problem was food. There were two thousand people in\nthe building, soft-bodied and city-bred. They were unaccustomed\nto hardship, and could not endure what more primitive people would\nhardly have noticed.\n\nThey must be fed, but first they must be taught to feed\nthemselves. The fishermen would help, but Arthur could only hope\nthat they would prove equal to the occasion. He did not know what\nto expect from them. From the hunters he expected but little. The\nIndians were wary hunters, and game would be shy if not scarce.\n\nThe great cloud of birds he had seen at sunset was a hopeful\nsign. Arthur vaguely remembered stories of great flocks of\nwood-pigeons which had been exterminated, as the buffalo was\nexterminated. As he considered the remembrance became more clear.\n\nThey had flown in huge flocks which nearly darkened the sky. As late\nas the forties of the nineteenth century they had been an important\narticle of food, and had glutted the market at certain seasons of\nthe year.\n\nEstelle had said the birds he had seen at sunset were\npigeons. Perhaps this was one of the great flocks. If it were really\nso, the food problem would be much lessened, provided a way could be\nfound to secure them. The ammunition in the tower was very limited,\nand a shell could not be found for every bird that was needed,\nnor even for every three or four. Great traps must be devised, or\nbird-lime might possibly be produced. Arthur made a mental note\nto ask Estelle if she knew anything of bird-lime.\n\nA vague, humming roar, altering in pitch, came to his ears. He\nlistened for some time before he identified it as the sound of the\nwind playing upon the irregular surfaces of the tower. In the city\nthe sound was drowned by the multitude of other noises, but here\nArthur could hear it plainly.\n\nHe listened a moment, and became surprised at the number of\nnight noises he could hear. In New York he had closed his ears to\nincidental sounds from sheer self-protection. Somewhere he heard\nthe ripple of a little spring. As the idea of a spring came into\nhis mind, he remembered Estelle's description of the deep-toned\nroar she had heard.\n\nHe put his hand on the cold stone of the building. There was still\na vibrant quivering of the rock. It was weaker than before, but\nwas still noticeable.\n\nHe drew back from the rock and looked up into the sky. It seemed\nto blaze with stars, far more stars than Arthur had ever seen in\nthe city, and more than he had dreamed existed.\n\nAs he looked, however, a cloud seemed to film a portion of the\nheavens. The stars still showed through it, but they twinkled in\na peculiar fashion that Arthur could not understand.\n\nHe watched in growing perplexity. The cloud moved very swiftly. Thin\nas it seemed to be, it should have been silvery from the moonlight,\nbut the sky was noticeably darker where it moved. It advanced toward\nthe tower and seemed to obscure the upper portion. A confused motion\nbecame visible among its parts. Wisps of it whirled away from the\nbrilliantly lighted tower, and then returned swiftly toward it.\n\nArthur heard a faint tinkle, then a musical scraping, which became\nlouder. A faint scream sounded, then another. The tinkle developed\ninto the sound made by breaking glass, and the scraping sound became\nthat of the broken fragments as they rubbed against the sides of\nthe tower in their fall.\n\nThe scream came again. It was the frightened cry of a woman. A\nsoft body struck the earth not ten feet from where Arthur stood,\nthen another, and another.\n\n\n\n\nXI.\n\n\nArthur urged the elevator boy to greater speed. They were speeding up\nthe shaft as rapidly as possible, but it was not fast enough. When\nthey at last reached the height at which the excitement seemed to\nbe centered, the car was stopped with a jerk and Arthur dashed down\nthe hall.\n\nHalf a dozen frightened stenographers stood there, huddled together.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" Arthur demanded. Men were running, from the\nother floors to see what the trouble was.\n\n\"The--the windows broke, and--and something flew in at us!\" one of\nthem gasped. There was a crash inside the nearest office and the\nwomen screamed again.\n\nArthur drew a revolver from his pocket and advanced to the door. He\nquickly threw it open, entered, and closed it behind him. Those\nleft out in the hall waited tensely.\n\nThere was no sound. The women began to look even more frightened. The\nmen shuffled their feet uneasily, and looked uncomfortably at one\nanother. Van Deventer appeared on the scene, puffing a little from\nhis haste.\n\nThe door opened again and Arthur came out. He was carrying something\nin his hands. He had put his revolver aside and looked somewhat\nfoolish but very much delighted.\n\n\"The food question is settled,\" he said happily. \"Look!\"\n\nHe held out the object he carried. It was a bird, apparently a\npigeon of some sort. It seemed to have been stunned, but as Arthur\nheld it out it stirred, then struggled, and in a moment was flapping\nwildly in an attempt to escape.\n\n\"It's a wood-pigeon,\" said Arthur. \"They must fly after dark\nsometimes. A big flock of them ran afoul of the tower and were\ndazed by the lights. They've broken a lot of windows, I dare say,\nbut a great many of them ran into the stonework and were stunned. I\nwas outside the tower, and when I came in they were dropping to\nthe ground by hundreds. I didn't know what they were then, but if\nwe wait twenty minutes or so I think we can go out and gather up\nour supper and breakfast and several other meals, all at once.\"\n\nEstelle had appeared and now reached out her hands for the bird.\n\n\"I'll take care of this one,\" she said. \"Wouldn't it be a good\nidea to see if there aren't some more stunned in the other offices?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn half an hour the electric stoves of the restaurant were going at\ntheir full capacity. Men, cheerfully excited men now, were bringing\nin pigeons by armfuls, and other men were skinning them. There was\nno time to pluck them, though a great many of the women were busily\nengaged in that occupation.\n\nAs fast as the birds could be cooked they were served out to the\nimpatient but much cheered castaways, and in a little while nearly\nevery person in the place was walking casually about the halls\nwith a roasted, broiled, or fried pigeon in his hands. The ovens\nwere roasting pigeons, the frying-pans were frying them, and the\nbroilers were loaded down with the small but tender birds.\n\nThe unexpected solution of the most pressing question cheered\nevery one amazingly. Many people were still frightened, but less\nfrightened than before. Worry for their families still oppressed\na great many, but the removal of the fear of immediate hunger led\nthem to believe that the other problems before them would be solved,\ntoo, and in as satisfactory a manner.\n\nArthur had returned to his office with four broiled pigeons in\na sheet of wrapping-paper. As he somehow expected, Estelle was\nwaiting there.\n\n\"Thought I'd bring lunch up,\" he announced. \"Are you hungry?\"\n\n\"Starving!\" Estelle replied, and laughed.\n\nThe whole catastrophe began to become an adventure. She bit eagerly\ninto a bird. Arthur began as hungrily on another. For some time\nneither spoke a word. At last, however, Arthur waved the leg of\nhis second pigeon toward his desk.\n\n\"Look what we've got here!\" he said.\n\nEstelle nodded. The stunned pigeon Arthur had first picked up was\ntied by one foot to a paper-weight.\n\n\"I thought we might keep him for a souvenir,\" she suggested.\n\n\"You seem pretty confident we'll get back, all right,\" Arthur\nobserved. \"It was surely lucky those blessed birds came along.\nThey've heartened up the people wonderfully!\"\n\n\"Oh, I knew you'd manage somehow!\" said Estelle confidently.\n\n\"I manage?\" Arthur repeated, smiling. \"What have I done?\"\n\n\"Why, you've done everything,\" affirmed Estelle stoutly. \"You've\ntold the people what to do from the very first, and you're going\nto get us back.\"\n\nArthur grinned, then suddenly his face grew a little more serious.\n\n\"I wish I were as sure as you are,\" he said. \"I think we'll be all\nright, though, sooner or later.\"\n\n\"I'm sure of it,\" Estelle declared with conviction. \"Why, you--\"\n\n\"Why I?\" asked Arthur again. He bent forward in his chair and fixed\nhis eyes on Estelle's. She looked up, met his gaze, and stammered.\n\n\"You--you do things,\" she finished lamely.\n\n\"I'm tempted to do something now,\" Arthur said. \"Look here, Miss\nWoodward, you've been in my employ for three or four months. In all\nthat time I've never had anything but the most impersonal comments\nfrom you. Why the sudden change?\"\n\nThe twinkle in his eyes robbed his words of any impertinence.\n\n\"Why, I really--I really suppose I never noticed you before,\"\nsaid Estelle.\n\n\"Please notice me hereafter,\" said Arthur. \"I have been noticing\nyou. I've been doing practically nothing else.\"\n\nEstelle flushed again. She tried to meet Arthur's eyes and\nfailed. She bit desperately into her pigeon drumstick, trying to\nthink of something to say.\n\n\"When we get back,\" went on Arthur meditatively, \"I'll have nothing\nto do--no work or anything. I'll be broke and out of a job.\"\n\nEstelle shook her head emphatically. Arthur paid no attention.\n\n\"Estelle,\" he said, smiling, \"would you like to be out of a job\nwith me?\"\n\nEstelle turned crimson.\n\n\"I'm not very successful,\" Arthur went on soberly. \"I'm afraid I\nwouldn't make a very good husband, I'm rather worthless and lazy!\"\n\n\"You aren't,\" broke in Estelle; \"you're--you're--\"\n\nArthur reached over and took her by the shoulders.\n\n\"What?\" he demanded.\n\nShe would not look at him, but she did not draw away. He held her\nfrom him for a moment.\n\n\"What am I?\" he demanded again. Somehow he found himself kissing\nthe tips of her ears. Her face was buried against his shoulder.\n\n\"What am I?\" he repeated sternly.\n\nHer voice was muffled by his coat.\n\n\"You're--you're dear!\" she said.\n\nThere was an interlude of about a minute and a half, then she pushed\nhim away from her.\n\n\"Don't!\" she said breathlessly. \"Please don't!\"\n\n\"Aren't you going to marry me?\" he demanded.\n\nStill crimson, she nodded shyly. He kissed her again.\n\n\"Please don't!\" she protested.\n\nShe fondled the lapels of his coat, quite content to have his arms\nabout her.\n\n\"Why mayn't I kiss you if you're going to marry me?\" Arthur demanded.\n\nShe looked up at him with an air of demure primness.\n\n\"You--you've been eating pigeon,\" she told him in mock gravity,\n\"and--and your mouth is greasy!\"\n\n\n\n\nXII.\n\n\nIt was two weeks later. Estelle looked out over the now familiar\nwild landscape. It was much the same when she looked far away,\nbut near by there were great changes.\n\nA cleared trail led through the woods to the waterfront, and a\nraft of logs extended out into the river for hundreds of feet.\nBoth sides of the raft were lined with busy fishermen--men and\nwomen, too. A little to the north of the base of the building a\nhuge mound of earth smoked sullenly. The coal in the cellar had\ngiven out and charcoal had been found to be the best substitute\nthey could improvise. The mound was where the charcoal was made.\n\nIt was heart-breaking work to keep the fires going with charcoal,\nbecause it burned so rapidly in the powerful draft of the furnaces,\nbut the original fire-room gang had been recruited to several\ntimes its original number from among the towerites, and the work\nwas divided until it did not seem hard.\n\nAs Estelle looked down two tiny figures sauntered across the clearing\nfrom the woods with a heavy animal slung between them. One of them\nwas using a gun as a walking-stick. Estelle saw the flash of the\nsun on its polished metal barrel.\n\nThere were a number of Indians in the clearing, watching with\nwide-open eyes the activities of the whites. Dozens of birch-bark\ncanoes dotted the Hudson, each with its load of fishermen,\nindustriously working for the white people. It had been hard to\novercome the fear in the Indians, and they still paid superstitious\nreverence to the whites, but fair dealings, coupled with a constant\nreadiness to defend themselves, had enabled Arthur to institute a\nsystem of trading for food that had so far proved satisfactory.\n\nThe whites had found spare electric-light bulbs valuable currency in\ndealing with the redmen. Picture-wire, too, was highly prized. There\nwas not a picture left hanging in any of the offices. Metal\npaper-knives bought huge quantities of provisions from the eager\nIndian traders, and the story was current in the tower that Arthur\nhad received eight canoe-loads of corn and vegetables in exchange\nfor a broken-down typewriter. No one could guess what the savages\nwanted with the typewriter, but they had carted it away triumphantly.\n\nEstelle smiled tenderly to herself as she remembered how Arthur had\nbeen the leading spirit in all the numberless enterprises in which\nthe castaways had been forced to engage. He would come to her in a\nspare ten minutes, and tell her how everything was going. He seemed\ncuriously boylike in those moments.\n\nSometimes he would come straight from the fire-room--he insisted on\ntaking part in all the more arduous duties--having hastily cleaned\nhimself for her inspection, snatch a hurried kiss, and then go\noff, laughing, to help chop down trees for the long fishing-raft.\nHe had told them how to make charcoal, had taken a leading part in\nestablishing and maintaining friendly relations with the Indians,\nand was now down in the deepest sub-basement, working with a gang\nof volunteers to try to put the building back where it belonged.\n\nEstelle had said, after the collapse of the flooring in\nthe board-room, that she heard a sound like the rushing of\nwaters. Arthur, on examining the floor where the safe-deposit vault\nstood, found it had risen an inch. On these facts he had built up\nhis theory. The building, like all modern sky-scrapers, rested on\nconcrete piles extending down to bedrock. In the center of one of\nthose piles there was a hollow tube originally intended to serve\nas an artesian well. The flow had been insufficient and the well\nhad been stopped up.\n\nArthur, of course, as an engineer, had studied the construction of\nthe building with great care, and happened to remember that this\npartly hollow pile was the one nearest the safe-deposit vault. The\ncollapse of the board-room floor had suggested that some change\nhad happened in the building itself, and that was found when he\nsaw that the deposit-vault had actually risen an inch.\n\nHe at once connected the rise in the flooring above the hollow\npile with the pipe in the pile. Estelle had heard liquid sounds.\nEvidently water had been forced into the hollow artesian pipe under\nan unthinkable pressure when the catastrophe occurred.\n\nFrom the rumbling and the suddenness of the whole catastrophe\na volcanic or seismic disturbance was evident. The connection of\nvolcanic or seismic action with a flow of water suggested a geyser or\na hot spring of some sort, probably a spring which had broken through\nits normal confines some time before, but whose pressure had been\nsufficient to prevent the accident until the failure of its flow.\n\nWhen the flow ceased the building sank rapidly. For the fact\nthat this \"sinking\" was in the fourth direction--the Fourth\nDimension--Arthur had no explanation. He simply knew that in some\nmysterious way an outlet for the pressure had developed in that\nfashion, and that the tower had followed the spring in its fall\nthrough time.\n\nThe sole apparent change in the building had occurred above the\none hollow concrete pile, which seemed to indicate that if access\nwere to be had to the mysterious, and so far only assumed spring,\nit must be through that pile. While the vault retained its abnormal\nelevation, Arthur believed that there was still water at an immense\nand incalculable pressure in the pipe. He dared not attempt to tap\nthe pipe until the pressure had abated.\n\nAt the end of a week he found the vault slowly settling back into\nplace. When its return to the normal was complete he dared begin\nboring a hole to reach the hollow tube in the concrete pile.\n\nAs he suspected, he found water in the pile--water whose sulfurous\nand mineral nature confirmed his belief that a geyser reaching deep\ninto the bosom of the earth, as well as far back in the realms of\ntime, was at the bottom of the extraordinary jaunt of the tower.\n\nGeysers were still far from satisfactory things to explain. There\nare many of their vagaries which we cannot understand at all.\nWe do know a few things which affect them, and one thing is that\n\"soaping\" them will stimulate their flow in an extraordinary manner.\n\nArthur proposed to \"soap\" this mysterious geyser when the renewal\nof its flow should lift the runaway sky-scraper back to the epoch\nfrom which the failure of the flow had caused it to fall.\n\nHe made his preparations with great care. He confidently expected\nhis plan to work, and to see the sky-scraper once more towering\nover mid-town New York as was its wont, but he did not allow the\nfishermen and hunters to relax their efforts on that account. They\nlabored as before, while deep down in the sub-basement of the\ncolossal building Arthur and his volunteers toiled mightily.\n\nThey had to bore through the concrete pile until they reached the\nhollow within it. Then, when the evidence gained from the water\nin the pipe had confirmed his surmises, they had to prepare their\n\"charge\" of soapy liquids by which the geyser was to be stirred to\nrenewed activity.\n\nGreat quantities of the soap used by the scrubwomen in scrubbing\ndown the floors was boiled with water until a sirupy mess was\nevolved. Means had then to be provided by which this could be quickly\nintroduced into the hollow pile, the hole then closed, and then\nbraced to withstand a pressure unparalleled in hydraulic science.\nArthur believed that from the hollow pile the soapy liquid would\nfind its way to the geyser proper, where it would take effect in\nstimulating the lessened flow to its former proportions. When that\ntook place he believed that the building would return as swiftly\nand as surely as it had left them to normal, modern times.\n\nThe telephone rang in his office, and Estelle answered it. Arthur\nwas on the wire. A signal was being hung out for all the castaway\nto return to the building from their several occupations. They were\nabout to soap the geyser.\n\nDid Estelle want to come down and watch? She did! She stood in the\nmain hallway as the excited and hopeful people trooped in. When\nthe last was inside the doors were firmly closed. The few friendly\nIndians outside stared perplexedly at the mysterious white strangers.\n\nThe whites, laughing excitedly, began to wave to the Indians. Their\nleave-taking was premature.\n\nEstelle took her way down into the cellar. Arthur was awaiting her\narrival. Van Deventer stood near, with the grinning, grimy members\nof Arthur's volunteer work gang. The massive concrete pile stood\nin the center of the cellar. A big steam-boiler was coupled to a\ntiny pipe that led into the heart of the mass of concrete. Arthur\nwas going to force the soapy liquid into the hollow pile by steam.\n\nAt a signal steam began to hiss in the boiler. Live steam from\nthe fire-room forced the soapy sirup out of the boiler, through\nthe small iron pipe, into the hollow that led to the geyser far\nunderground. Six thousand gallons in all were forced into the\nopening in a space of three minutes.\n\nArthur's grimy gang began to work with desperate haste. Quickly\nthey withdrew the iron pipe and inserted a long steel plug,\npainfully beaten from a bar of solid metal. Then, girding the\ncolossal concrete pile, ring after ring of metal was slipped on,\nto hold the plug in place.\n\nThe last of the safeguards was hardly fastened firmly when Estelle\nlistened intently.\n\n\"I hear a rumbling!\" she said quietly.\n\nArthur reached forward and put his hand on the mass of concrete.\n\n\"It is quivering!\" he reported as quietly. \"I think we'll be on\nour way in a very little while.\"\n\nThe group broke for the stairs, to watch the panorama as the runaway\nsky-scraper made its way back through the thousands of years to\nthe times that had built it for a monument to modern commerce.\n\nArthur and Estelle went high up in the tower. From the window of\nArthur's office they looked eagerly, and felt the slight quiver as\nthe tower got under way. Estelle looked up at the sun, and saw it\nmend its pace toward the west.\n\nNight fell. The evening sounds became high-pitched and shrill,\nthen seemed to cease altogether.\n\nIn a very little while there was light again, and the sun was\nspeeding across the sky. It sank hastily, and returned almost\nimmediately, _via_ the east. Its pace became a breakneck rush. Down\nbehind the hills and up in the east. Down in the west, up in the\neast. Down and up-- The flickering began. The race back toward modern\ntimes had started.\n\nArthur and Estelle stood at the window and looked out as the sun\nrushed more and more rapidly across the sky until it became but a\nstreak of light, shifting first to the right and then to the left\nas the seasons passed in their turn.\n\nWith Arthur's arms about her shoulders, Estelle stared out across\nthe unbelievable landscape, while the nights and days, the winters\nand summers, and the storms and calms of a thousand years swept\npast them into the irrevocable past.\n\nPresently Arthur drew her to him and kissed her. While he kissed\nher, so swiftly did the days and years flee by, three generations\nwere born, grew and begot children, and died again!\n\nEstelle, held fast in Arthur's arms, thought nothing of such trivial\nthings. She put her arms about his neck and kissed him, while the\nyears passed them unheeded.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOf course you know that the building landed safely, in the exact\nhour, minute, and second from which it started, so that when the\nfrightened and excited people poured out of it to stand in Madison\nSquare and feel that the world was once more right side up, their\nhilarious and incomprehensible conduct made such of the world as\nwas passing by think a contagious madness had broken out.\n\nDays passed before the story of the two thousand was believed, but\nat last it was accepted as truth, and eminent scientists studied\nthe matter exhaustively.\n\nThere has been one rather queer result of the journey of the\nrunaway sky-scraper. A certain Isidore Eckstein, a dealer in jewelry\nnovelties, whose office was in the tower when it disappeared into the\npast, has entered suit in the courts of the United States against\nall the holders of land on Manhattan Island. It seems that during\nthe two weeks in which the tower rested in the wilderness he traded\nindependently with one of the Indian chiefs, and in exchange for\ntwo near-pearl necklaces, sixteen finger-rings, and one dollar in\nmoney, received a title-deed to the entire island.--He claims that\nhis deed is a conveyance made previous to all other sales whatever.\n\nStrictly speaking, he is undoubtedly right, as his deed was\nsigned before the discovery of America. The courts, however, are\ndeliberating the question with a great deal of perplexity.\n\nEckstein is quite confident that in the end his claim will be\nallowed and he will be admitted as the sole owner of real-estate\non Manhattan Island, with all occupiers of buildings and territory\npaying him ground rent at a rate he will fix himself. In the mean\ntime, though the foundations are being reinforced so the catastrophe\ncannot occur again, his entire office is packed full of articles\nsuitable for trading with the Indians. If the tower makes another\ntrip back through time, Eckstein hopes to become a landholder of\nsome importance.\n\nNo less than eighty-seven books have been written by members of\nthe memorable two thousand in description of their trip to the\nhinterland of time, but Arthur, who could write more intelligently\nabout the matter than any one else, is so extremely busy that\nhe cannot bother with such things. He has two very important\nmatters to look after. One is, of course, the reenforcement of the\nfoundations of the building so that a repetition of the catastrophe\ncannot occur, and the other is to convince his wife--who is Estelle,\nnaturally--that she is the most adorable person in the universe. He\nfinds the latter task the more difficult, because she insists that\n_he_ is the most adorable person--\n\n[* Transcriber's note: This etext was produced from the February 22,\n1919 issue of _Argosy_ magazine.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Runaway Skyscraper, by Murray Leinster\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE RUNAWAY SKYSCRAPER ***\n\n***** This file should be named 17355.txt or 17355.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/7/3/5/17355/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks and the Online Distributed\nProofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n*** END: FULL LICENSE ***\n"}
