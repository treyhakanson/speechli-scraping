FONTENAY\n\n\n            _When you have an engine with no fuel, and fuel\n            without an engine, and a life-and-death deadline\n           to meet, you have a problem indeed. Unless you are\n           a stubborn Dutchman--and Jan Van Artevelde was the\n                     stubbornest Dutchman on Venus._\n\n\nJan Willem van Artevelde claimed descent from William of Orange. He had\nno genealogy to prove it, but on Venus there was no one who could\ndisprove it, either.\n\nJan Willem van Artevelde smoked a clay pipe, which only a Dutchman can\ndo properly, because the clay bit grates on less stubborn teeth.\n\nJan needed all his Dutch stubbornness, and a good deal of pure physical\nstrength besides, to maneuver the roach-flat groundcar across the\ntumbled terrain of Den Hoorn into the teeth of the howling gale that\nswept from the west. The huge wheels twisted and jolted against the\nrocks outside, and Jan bounced against his seat belt, wrestled the\nsteering wheel and puffed at his _pijp_. The mild aroma of\nHeerenbaai-Tabak filled the airtight groundcar.\n\nThere came a new swaying that was not the roughness of the terrain.\nThrough the thick windshield Jan saw all the ground about him buckle and\nheave for a second or two before it settled to rugged quiescence again.\nThis time he was really heaved about.\n\nJan mentioned this to the groundcar radio.\n\n\"That's the third time in half an hour,\" he commented. \"The place tosses\nlike the IJsselmeer on a rough day.\"\n\n\"You just don't forget it _isn't_ the Zuider Zee,\" retorted Heemskerk\nfrom the other end. \"You sink there and you don't come up three times.\"\n\n\"Don't worry,\" said Jan. \"I'll be back on time, with a broom at the\nmasthead.\"\n\n\"This I shall want to see,\" chuckled Heemskerk; a logical reaction,\nconsidering the scarcity of brooms on Venus.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTwo hours earlier the two men had sat across a small table playing\nchess, with little indication there would be anything else to occupy\ntheir time before blastoff of the stubby gravity-boat. It would be their\nlast chess game for many months, for Jan was a member of the Dutch\ncolony at Oostpoort in the northern hemisphere of Venus, while Heemskerk\nwas pilot of the G-boat from the Dutch spaceship _Vanderdecken_,\nscheduled to begin an Earthward orbit in a few hours.\n\nIt was near the dusk of the 485-hour Venerian day, and the Twilight Gale\nalready had arisen, sweeping from the comparatively chill Venerian\nnightside into the superheated dayside. Oostpoort, established near some\noutcroppings that contained uranium ore, was protected from both the\nDawn Gale and the Twilight Gale, for it was in a valley in the midst of\na small range of mountains.\n\nJan had just figured out a combination by which he hoped to cheat\nHeemskerk out of one of his knights, when Dekker, the _burgemeester_ of\nOostpoort, entered the spaceport ready room.\n\n\"There's been an emergency radio message,\" said Dekker. \"They've got a\npassenger for the Earthship over at Rathole.\"\n\n\"Rathole?\" repeated Heemskerk. \"What's that? I didn't know there was\nanother colony within two thousand kilometers.\"\n\n\"It isn't a colony, in the sense Oostpoort is,\" explained Dekker. \"The\npeople are the families of a bunch of laborers left behind when the\ncolony folded several years ago. It's about eighty kilometers away,\nright across the Hoorn, but they don't have any vehicles that can\nnavigate when the wind's up.\"\n\nHeemskerk pushed his short-billed cap back on his close-cropped head,\nleaned back in his chair and folded his hands over his comfortable\nstomach.\n\n\"Then the passenger will have to wait for the next ship,\" he pronounced.\n\"The _Vanderdecken_ has to blast off in thirty hours to catch Earth at\nthe right orbital spot, and the G-boat has to blast off in ten hours to\ncatch the _Vanderdecken_.\"\n\n\"This passenger can't wait,\" said Dekker. \"He needs to be evacuated to\nEarth immediately. He's suffering from the Venus Shadow.\"\n\nJan whistled softly. He had seen the effects of that disease. Dekker was\nright.\n\n\"Jan, you're the best driver in Oostpoort,\" said Dekker. \"You will have\nto take a groundcar to Rathole and bring the fellow back.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSo now Jan gripped his clay pipe between his teeth and piloted the\ngroundcar into the teeth of the Twilight Gale.\n\nDen Hoorn was a comparatively flat desert sweep that ran along the\nwestern side of the Oost Mountains, just over the mountain from\nOostpoort. It was a thin fault area of a planet whose crust was\npeculiarly subject to earthquakes, particularly at the beginning and end\nof each long day when temperatures of the surface rocks changed. On the\nother side of it lay Rathole, a little settlement that eked a precarious\nliving from the Venerian vegetation. Jan never had seen it.\n\nHe had little difficulty driving up and over the mountain, for the Dutch\nsettlers had carved a rough road through the ravines. But even the\n2-1/2-meter wheels of the groundcar had trouble amid the tumbled rocks\nof Den Hoorn. The wind hit the car in full strength here and, though the\nbody of the groundcar was suspended from the axles, there was constant\ndanger of its being flipped over by a gust if not handled just right.\n\nThe three earthshocks that had shaken Den Hoorn since he had been\ndriving made his task no easier, but he was obviously lucky, at that.\nOften he had to detour far from his course to skirt long, deep cracks in\nthe surface, or steep breaks where the crust had been raised or dropped\nseveral meters by past quakes.\n\nThe groundcar zig-zagged slowly westward. The tattered violet-and-indigo\nclouds boiled low above it, but the wind was as dry as the breath of an\noven. Despite the heavy cloud cover, the afternoon was as bright as an\nEarth-day. The thermometer showed the outside temperature to have\ndropped to 40 degrees Centigrade in the west wind, and it was still\ngoing down.\n\nJan reached the edge of a crack that made further progress seem\nimpossible. A hundred meters wide, of unknown depth, it stretched out of\nsight in both directions. For the first time he entertained serious\ndoubts that Den Hoorn could be crossed by land.\n\nAfter a moment's hesitation, he swung the groundcar northward and raced\nalong the edge of the chasm as fast as the car would negotiate the\nterrain. He looked anxiously at his watch. Nearly three hours had passed\nsince he left Oostpoort. He had seven hours to go and he was still at\nleast 16 kilometers from Rathole. His pipe was out, but he could not\ntake his hands from the wheel to refill it.\n\nHe had driven at least eight kilometers before he realized that the\ncrack was narrowing. At least as far again, the two edges came together,\nbut not at the same level. A sheer cliff three meters high now barred\nhis passage. He drove on.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nApparently it was the result of an old quake. He found a spot where\nrocks had tumbled down, making a steep, rough ramp up the break. He\ndrove up it and turned back southwestward.\n\nHe made it just in time. He had driven less than three hundred meters\nwhen a quake more severe than any of the others struck. Suddenly behind\nhim the break reversed itself, so that where he had climbed up coming\nwestward he would now have to climb a cliff of equal height returning\neastward.\n\nThe ground heaved and buckled like a tempestuous sea. Rocks rolled and\nleaped through the air, several large ones striking the groundcar with\nominous force. The car staggered forward on its giant wheels like a\ndrunken man. The quake was so violent that at one time the vehicle was\nhurled several meters sideways, and almost overturned. And the wind\nsmashed down on it unrelentingly.\n\nThe quake lasted for several minutes, during which Jan was able to make\nno progress at all and struggled only to keep the groundcar upright.\nThen, in unison, both earthquake and wind died to absolute quiescence.\n\nJan made use of this calm to step down on the accelerator and send the\ngroundcar speeding forward. The terrain was easier here, nearing the\nwestern edge of Den Hoorn, and he covered several kilometers before the\nwind struck again, cutting his speed down considerably. He judged he\nmust be nearing Rathole.\n\nNot long thereafter, he rounded an outcropping of rock and it lay before\nhim.\n\nA wave of nostalgia swept over him. Back at Oostpoort, the power was\nnuclear, but this little settlement made use of the cheapest, most\nobviously available power source. It was dotted with more than a dozen\nwindmills.\n\nWindmills! Tears came to Jan's eyes. For a moment, he was carried back\nto the flat lands around 's Gravenhage. For a moment he was a\ntow-headed, round-eyed boy again, clumping in wooden shoes along the\nedge of the tulip fields.\n\nBut there were no canals here. The flat land, stretching into the\ndarkening west, was spotted with patches of cactus and leather-leaved\nVenerian plants. Amid the windmills, low domes protruded from the earth,\nindicating that the dwellings of Rathole were, appropriately, partly\nunderground.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe drove into the place. There were no streets, as such, but there were\navenues between lines of heavy chains strung to short iron posts,\nevidently as handholds against the wind. The savage gale piled dust and\nsand in drifts against the domes, then, shifting slightly, swept them\nclean again.\n\nThere was no one moving abroad, but just inside the community Jan found\nhalf a dozen men in a group, clinging to one of the chains and waving to\nhim. He pulled the groundcar to a stop beside them, stuck his pipe in a\npocket of his plastic venusuit, donned his helmet and got out.\n\nThe wind almost took him away before one of them grabbed him and he was\nable to grasp the chain himself. They gathered around him. They were\nswarthy, black-eyed men, with curly hair. One of them grasped his hand.\n\n\"_Bienvenido, se\u00f1or_,\" said the man.\n\nJan recoiled and dropped the man's hand. All the Orangeman blood he\nclaimed protested in outrage.\n\nSpaniards! All these men were Spaniards!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJan recovered himself at once. He had been reading too much ancient\nhistory during his leisure hours. The hot monotony of Venus was\nbeginning to affect his brain. It had been 500 years since the\nNetherlands revolted against Spanish rule. A lot of water over the dam\nsince then.\n\nA look at the men around him, the sound of their chatter, convinced him\nthat he need not try German or Hollandsch here. He fell back on the\ninternational language.\n\n\"Do you speak English?\" he asked. The man brightened but shook his head.\n\n\"_No hablo ingl\u00e9s_,\" he said, \"_pero el m\u00e9dico lo habla. Venga\nconmigo._\"\n\nHe gestured for Jan to follow him and started off, pulling his way\nagainst the wind along the chain. Jan followed, and the other men fell\nin behind in single file. A hundred meters farther on, they turned,\ndescended some steps and entered one of the half-buried domes. A\ngray-haired, bearded man was in the well-lighted room, apparently the\nliving room of a home, with a young woman.\n\n\"_\u00c9l m\u00e9dico_,\" said the man who had greeted Jan, gesturing. \"_\u00c9l habla\ningl\u00e9s._\"\n\nHe went out, shutting the airlock door behind him.\n\n\"You must be the man from Oostpoort,\" said the bearded man, holding out\nhis hand. \"I am Doctor Sanchez. We are very grateful you have come.\"\n\n\"I thought for a while I wouldn't make it,\" said Jan ruefully, removing\nhis venushelmet.\n\n\"This is Mrs. Murillo,\" said Sanchez.\n\nThe woman was a Spanish blonde, full-lipped and beautiful, with golden\nhair and dark, liquid eyes. She smiled at Jan.\n\n\"_Encantada de conocerlo, se\u00f1or_,\" she greeted him.\n\n\"Is this the patient, Doctor?\" asked Jan, astonished. She looked in the\nbest of health.\n\n\"No, the patient is in the next room,\" answered Sanchez.\n\n\"Well, as much as I'd like to stop for a pipe, we'd better start at\nonce,\" said Jan. \"It's a hard drive back, and blastoff can't be\ndelayed.\"\n\nThe woman seemed to sense his meaning. She turned and called: \"_Diego!_\"\n\nA boy appeared in the door, a dark-skinned, sleepy-eyed boy of about\neight. He yawned. Then, catching sight of the big Dutchman, he opened\nhis eyes wide and smiled.\n\nThe boy was healthy-looking, alert, but the mark of the Venus Shadow was\non his face. There was a faint mottling, a criss-cross of dead-white\nlines.\n\nMrs. Murillo spoke to him rapidly in Spanish and he nodded. She zipped\nhim into a venusuit and fitted a small helmet on his head.\n\n\"Good luck, _amigo_,\" said Sanchez, shaking Jan's hand again.\n\n\"Thanks,\" replied Jan. He donned his own helmet. \"I'll need it, if the\ntrip over was any indication.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJan and Diego made their way back down the chain to the groundcar. There\nwas a score of men there now, and a few women. They let the pair go\nthrough, and waved farewell as Jan swung the groundcar around and headed\nback eastward.\n\nIt was easier driving with the wind behind him, and Jan hit a hundred\nkilometers an hour several times before striking the rougher ground of\nDen Hoorn. Now, if he could only find a way over the bluff raised by\nthat last quake....\n\nThe ground of Den Hoorn was still shivering. Jan did not realize this\nuntil he had to brake the groundcar almost to a stop at one point,\nbecause it was not shaking in severe, periodic shocks as it had earlier.\nIt quivered constantly, like the surface of quicksand.\n\nThe ground far ahead of him had a strange color to it. Jan, watching for\nthe cliff he had to skirt and scale, had picked up speed over some\nfairly even terrain, but now he slowed again, puzzled. There was\nsomething wrong ahead. He couldn't quite figure it out.\n\nDiego, beside him, had sat quietly so far, peering eagerly through the\nwindshield, not saying a word. Now suddenly he cried in a high thin\ntenor:\n\n\"_Cuidado! Cuidado! Un abismo!_\"\n\nJim saw it at the same time and hit the brakes so hard the groundcar\nwould have stood on its nose had its wheels been smaller. They skidded\nto a stop.\n\nThe chasm that had caused him such a long detour before had widened,\nevidently in the big quake that had hit earlier. Now it was a canyon,\nhalf a kilometer wide. Five meters from the edge he looked out over\nblank space at the far wall, and could not see the bottom.\n\nCursing choice Dutch profanity, Jan wheeled the groundcar northward and\ndrove along the edge of the abyss as fast as he could. He wasted half an\nhour before realizing that it was getting no narrower.\n\nThere was no point in going back southward. It might be a hundred\nkilometers long or a thousand, but he never could reach the end of it\nand thread the tumbled rocks of Den Hoorn to Oostpoort before the G-boat\nblastoff.\n\nThere was nothing to do but turn back to Rathole and see if some other\nway could not be found.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJan sat in the half-buried room and enjoyed the luxury of a pipe filled\nwith some of Theodorus Neimeijer's mild tobacco. Before him, Dr. Sanchez\nsat with crossed legs, cleaning his fingernails with a scalpel. Diego's\nmother talked to the boy in low, liquid tones in a corner of the room.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJan was at a loss to know how people whose technical knowledge was as\nskimpy as it obviously was in Rathole were able to build these\nsemi-underground domes to resist the earth shocks that came from Den\nHoorn. But this one showed no signs of stress. A religious print and a\nsmall pencil sketch of Se\u00f1ora Murillo, probably done by the boy, were\nawry on the inward-curving walls, but that was all.\n\nJan felt justifiably exasperated at these Spanish-speaking people.\n\n\"If some effort had been made to take the boy to Oostpoort from here,\ninstead of calling on us to send a car, Den Hoorn could have been\ncrossed before the crack opened,\" he pointed out.\n\n\"An effort was made,\" replied Sanchez quietly. \"Perhaps you do not fully\nrealize our position here. We have no engines except the stationary\ngenerators that give us current for our air-conditioning and our\nutilities. They are powered by the windmills. We do not have gasoline\nengines for vehicles, so our vehicles are operated by hand.\"\n\n\"You push them?\" demanded Jan incredulously.\n\n\"No. You've seen pictures of the pump-cars that once were used on\nterrestrial railroads? Ours are powered like that, but we cannot operate\nthem when the Venerian wind is blowing. By the time I diagnosed the\nVenus Shadow in Diego, the wind was coming up, and we had no way to get\nhim to Oostpoort.\"\n\n\"Mmm,\" grunted Jan. He shifted uncomfortably and looked at the pair in\nthe corner. The blonde head was bent over the boy protectingly, and over\nhis mother's shoulder Diego's black eyes returned Jan's glance.\n\n\"If the disease has just started, the boy could wait for the next Earth\nship, couldn't he?\" asked Jan.\n\n\"I said I had just diagnosed it, not that it had just started, _se\u00f1or_,\"\ncorrected Sanchez. \"As you know, the trip to Earth takes 145 days and it\ncan be started only when the two planets are at the right position in\ntheir orbits. Have you ever seen anyone die of the Venus Shadow?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have,\" replied Jan in a low voice. He had seen two people die of\nit, and it had not been pleasant.\n\nMedical men thought it was a deficiency disease, but they had not traced\ndown the deficiency responsible. Treatment by vitamins, diet,\nantibiotics, infrared and ultraviolet rays, all were useless. The only\nthing that could arrest and cure the disease was removal from the dry,\ncloud-hung surface of Venus and return to a moist, sunny climate on\nEarth.\n\nWithout that treatment, once the typical mottled texture of the skin\nappeared, the flesh rapidly deteriorated and fell away in chunks. The\nvictim remained unfevered and agonizingly conscious until the\ndegeneration reached a vital spot.\n\n\"If you have,\" said Sanchez, \"you must realize that Diego cannot wait\nfor a later ship, if his life is to be saved. He must get to Earth at\nonce.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJan puffed at the Heerenbaai-Tabak and cogitated. The place was aptly\nnamed. It was a ratty community. The boy was a dark-skinned little\nSpaniard--of Mexican origin, perhaps. But he was a boy, and a human\nbeing.\n\nA thought occurred to him. From what he had seen and heard, the entire\neconomy of Rathole could not support the tremendous expense of sending\nthe boy across the millions of miles to Earth by spaceship.\n\n\"Who's paying his passage?\" he asked. \"The Dutch Central Venus Company\nisn't exactly a charitable institution.\"\n\n\"Your _Se\u00f1or_ Dekker said that would be taken care of,\" replied Sanchez.\n\nJan relit his pipe silently, making a mental resolution that Dekker\nwouldn't take care of it alone. Salaries for Venerian service were high,\nand many of the men at Oostpoort would contribute readily to such a\ncause.\n\n\"Who is Diego's father?\" he asked.\n\n\"He was Ram\u00f3n Murillo, a very good mechanic,\" answered Sanchez, with a\nsliding sidelong glance at Jan's face. \"He has been dead for three\nyears.\"\n\nJan grunted.\n\n\"The copters at Oostpoort can't buck this wind,\" he said thoughtfully,\n\"or I'd have come in one of those in the first place instead of trying\nto cross Den Hoorn by land. But if you have any sort of aircraft here,\nit might make it downwind--if it isn't wrecked on takeoff.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid not,\" said Sanchez.\n\n\"Too bad. There's nothing we can do, then. The nearest settlement west\nof here is more than a thousand kilometers away, and I happen to know\nthey have no planes, either. Just copters. So that's no help.\"\n\n\"Wait,\" said Sanchez, lifting the scalpel and tilting his head. \"I\nbelieve there is something, though we cannot use it. This was once an\nAmerican naval base, and the people here were civilian employes who\nrefused to move north with it. There was a flying machine they used for\nshort-range work, and one was left behind--probably with a little help\nfrom the people of the settlement. But....\"\n\n\"What kind of machine? Copter or plane?\"\n\n\"They call it a flying platform. It carries two men, I believe. But,\n_se\u00f1or_....\"\n\n\"I know them. I've operated them, before I left Earth. Man, you don't\nexpect me to try to fly one of those little things in this wind? They're\ntricky as they can be, and the passengers are absolutely unprotected!\"\n\n\"_Se\u00f1or_, I have asked you to do nothing.\"\n\n\"No, you haven't,\" muttered Jan. \"But you know I'll do it.\"\n\nSanchez looked into his face, smiling faintly and a little sadly.\n\n\"I was sure you would be willing,\" he said. He turned and spoke in\nSpanish to Mrs. Murillo.\n\nThe woman rose to her feet and came to them. As Jan arose, she looked up\nat him, tears in her eyes.\n\n\"_Gracias_,\" she murmured. \"_Un mill\u00f3n de gracias._\"\n\nShe lifted his hands in hers and kissed them.\n\nJan disengaged himself gently, embarrassed. But it occurred to him,\nlooking down on the bowed head of the beautiful young widow, that he\nmight make some flying trips back over here in his leisure time.\nLanguage barriers were not impassable, and feminine companionship might\ncure his neurotic, history-born distaste for Spaniards, for more than\none reason.\n\nSanchez was tugging at his elbow.\n\n\"_Se\u00f1or_, I have been trying to tell you,\" he said. \"It is generous and\ngood of you, and I wanted _Se\u00f1ora_ Murillo to know what a brave man you\nare. But have you forgotten that we have no gasoline engines here? There\nis no fuel for the flying platform.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe platform was in a warehouse which, like the rest of the structures\nin Rathole, was a half-buried dome. The platform's ring-shaped base was\nless than a meter thick, standing on four metal legs. On top of it, in\nthe center, was a railed circle that would hold two men, but would crowd\nthem. Two small gasoline engines sat on each side of this railed circle\nand between them on a third side was the fuel tank. The passengers\nentered it on the fourth side.\n\nThe machine was dusty and spotted with rust, Jan, surrounded by Sanchez,\nDiego and a dozen men, inspected it thoughtfully. The letters USN*SES\nwere painted in white on the platform itself, and each engine bore the\nlabel \"Hiller.\"\n\nJan peered over the edge of the platform at the twin-ducted fans in\ntheir plastic shrouds. They appeared in good shape. Each was powered by\none of the engines, transmitted to it by heavy rubber belts.\n\nJan sighed. It was an unhappy situation. As far as he could determine,\nwithout making tests, the engines were in perfect condition. Two\nperfectly good engines, and no fuel for them.\n\n\"You're sure there's no gasoline, anywhere in Rathole?\" he asked\nSanchez.\n\nSanchez smiled ruefully, as he had once before, at Jan's appellation for\nthe community. The inhabitants' term for it was simply \"_La Ciudad\nNuestra_\"--\"Our Town.\" But he made no protest. He turned to one of the\nother men and talked rapidly for a few moments in Spanish.\n\n\"None, _se\u00f1or_,\" he said, turning back to Jan. \"The Americans, of\ncourse, kept much of it when they were here, but the few things we take\nto Oostpoort to trade could not buy precious gasoline. We have\nelectricity in plenty if you can power the platform with it.\"\n\nJan thought that over, trying to find a way.\n\n\"No, it wouldn't work,\" he said. \"We could rig batteries on the platform\nand electric motors to turn the propellers. But batteries big enough to\npower it all the way to Oostpoort would be so heavy the machine couldn't\nlift them off the ground. If there were some way to carry a power line\nall the way to Oostpoort, or to broadcast the power to it.... But it's a\nlight-load machine, and must have an engine that gives it the necessary\npower from very little weight.\"\n\nWild schemes ran through his head. If they were on water, instead of\nland, he could rig up a sail. He could still rig up a sail, for a\ngroundcar, except for the chasm out on Den Hoorn.\n\nThe groundcar! Jan straightened and snapped his fingers.\n\n\"Doctor!\" he explained. \"Send a couple of men to drain the rest of the\nfuel from my groundcar. And let's get this platform above ground and tie\nit down until we can get it started.\"\n\nSanchez gave rapid orders in Spanish. Two of the men left at a run,\ncarrying five-gallon cans with them.\n\nThree others picked up the platform and carried it up a ramp and\noutside. As soon as they reached ground level, the wind hit them. They\ndropped the platform to the ground, where it shuddered and swayed\nmomentarily, and two of the men fell successfully on their stomachs. The\nwind caught the third and somersaulted him half a dozen times before he\nskidded to a stop on his back with outstretched arms and legs. He turned\nover cautiously and crawled back to them.\n\nJan, his head just above ground level, surveyed the terrain. There was\nflat ground to the east, clear in a fairly broad alley for at least half\na kilometer before any of the domes protruded up into it.\n\n\"This is as good a spot for takeoff as we'll find,\" he said to Sanchez.\n\nThe men put three heavy ropes on the platform's windward rail and\nsecured it by them to the heavy chain that ran by the dome. The platform\nquivered and shuddered in the heavy wind, but its base was too low for\nit to overturn.\n\nShortly the two men returned with the fuel from the groundcar,\nstruggling along the chain. Jan got above ground in a crouch, clinging\nto the rail of the platform, and helped them fill the fuel tank with it.\nHe primed the carburetors and spun the engines.\n\nNothing happened.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe turned the engines over again. One of them coughed, and a cloud of\nblue smoke burst from its exhaust, but they did not catch.\n\n\"What is the matter, _se\u00f1or_?\" asked Sanchez from the dome entrance.\n\n\"I don't know,\" replied Jan. \"Maybe it's that the engines haven't been\nused in so long. I'm afraid I'm not a good enough mechanic to tell.\"\n\n\"Some of these men were good mechanics when the navy was here,\" said\nSanchez. \"Wait.\"\n\nHe turned and spoke to someone in the dome. One of the men of Rathole\ncame to Jan's side and tried the engines. They refused to catch. The man\nmade carburetor adjustments and tried again. No success.\n\nHe sniffed, took the cap from the fuel tank and stuck a finger inside.\nHe withdrew it, wet and oily, and examined it. He turned and spoke to\nSanchez.\n\n\"He says that your groundcar must have a diesel engine,\" Sanchez\ninterpreted to Jan. \"Is that correct?\"\n\n\"Why, yes, that's true.\"\n\n\"He says the fuel will not work then, _se\u00f1or_. He says it is low-grade\nfuel and the platform must have high octane gasoline.\"\n\nJan threw up his hands and went back into the dome.\n\n\"I should have known that,\" he said unhappily. \"I would have known if I\nhad thought of it.\"\n\n\"What is to be done, then?\" asked Sanchez.\n\n\"There's nothing that can be done,\" answered Jan. \"They may as well put\nthe fuel back in my groundcar.\"\n\nSanchez called orders to the men at the platform. While they worked, Jan\nstared out at the furiously spinning windmills that dotted Rathole.\n\n\"There's nothing that can be done,\" he repeated. \"We can't make the trip\noverland because of the chasm out there in Den Hoorn, and we can't fly\nthe platform because we have no power for it.\"\n\nWindmills. Again Jan could imagine the flat land around them as his\nnative Holland, with the Zuider Zee sparkling to the west where here the\ndesert stretched under darkling clouds.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJan looked at his watch. A little more than two hours before the\nG-boat's blastoff time, and it couldn't wait for them. It was nearly\neight hours since he had left Oostpoort, and the afternoon was getting\nnoticeably darker.\n\nJan was sorry. He had done his best, but Venus had beaten him.\n\nHe looked around for Diego. The boy was not in the dome. He was outside,\ncrouched in the lee of the dome, playing with some sticks.\n\nDiego must know of his ailment, and why he had to go to Oostpoort. If\nJan was any judge of character, Sanchez would have told him that.\nWhether Diego knew it was a life-or-death matter for him to be aboard\nthe _Vanderdecken_ when it blasted off for Earth, Jan did not know. But\nthe boy was around eight years old and he was bright, and he must\nrealize the seriousness involved in a decision to send him all the way\nto Earth.\n\nJan felt ashamed of the exuberant foolishness which had led him to spout\nancient history and claim descent from William of Orange. It had been a\nhobby, and artificial topic for conversation that amused him and his\ncompanions, a defense against the monotony of Venus that had begun to\naffect his personality perhaps a bit more than he realized. He did not\ndislike Spaniards; he had no reason to dislike them. They were all\nhumans--the Spanish, the Dutch, the Germans, the Americans, even the\nRussians--fighting a hostile planet together. He could not understand a\nword Diego said when the boy spoke to him, but he liked Diego and wished\ndesperately he could do something.\n\nOutside, the windmills of Rathole spun merrily.\n\nThere was power, the power that lighted and air-conditioned Rathole,\npower in the air all around them. If he could only use it! But to turn\nthe platform on its side and let the wind spin the propellers was\npointless.\n\nHe turned to Sanchez.\n\n\"Ask the men if there are any spare parts for the platform,\" he said.\n\"Some of those legs it stands on, transmission belts, spare propellers.\"\n\nSanchez asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"Many spare parts, but no fuel.\"\n\nJan smiled a tight smile.\n\n\"Tell them to take the engines out,\" he said. \"Since we have no fuel, we\nmay as well have no engines.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPieter Heemskerk stood by the ramp to the stubby G-boat and checked his\nwatch. It was X minus fifteen--fifteen minutes before blastoff time.\n\nHeemskerk wore a spacesuit. Everything was ready, except climbing\naboard, closing the airlock and pressing the firing pin.\n\nWhat on Venus could have happened to Van Artevelde? The last radio\nmessage they had received, more than an hour ago, had said he and the\npatient took off successfully in an aircraft. What sort of aircraft\ncould he be flying that would require an hour to cover eighty\nkilometers, with the wind?\n\nHeemskerk could only draw the conclusion that the aircraft had been\nwrecked somewhere in Den Hoorn. As a matter of fact, he knew that\npreparations were being made now to send a couple of groundcars out to\nsearch for it.\n\nThis, of course, would be too late to help the patient Van Artevelde was\nbringing, but Heemskerk had no personal interest in the patient. His\nworry was all for his friend. The two of them had enjoyed chess and good\nbeer together on his last three trips to Venus, and Heemskerk hoped very\nsincerely that the big blond man wasn't hurt.\n\nHe glanced at his watch again. X minus twelve. In two minutes, it would\nbe time for him to walk up the ramp into the G-boat. In seven minutes\nthe backward count before blastoff would start over the area\nloudspeakers.\n\nHeemskerk shook his head sadly. And Van Artevelde had promised to come\nback triumphant, with a broom at his masthead!\n\nIt was a high thin whine borne on the wind, carrying even through the\nwalls of his spacehelmet, that attracted Heemskerk's attention and\ncaused him to pause with his foot on the ramp. Around him, the rocket\nmechanics were staring up at the sky, trying to pinpoint the noise.\n\nHeemskerk looked westward. At first he could see nothing, then there was\na moving dot above the mountain, against the indigo umbrella of clouds.\nIt grew, it swooped, it approached and became a strange little flying\ndisc with two people standing on it and _something_ sticking up from its\ndeck in front of them.\n\nA broom?\n\nNo. The platform hovered and began to settle nearby, and there was Van\nArtevelde leaning over its rail and fiddling frantically with whatever\nit was that stuck up on it--a weird, angled contraption of pipes and\nbelts topped by a whirring blade. A boy stood at his shoulder and tried\nto help him. As the platform descended to a few meters above ground, the\nDutchman slashed at the contraption, the cut ends of belts whipped out\nwildly and the platform slid to the ground with a rush. It hit with a\nclatter and its two passengers tumbled prone to the ground.\n\n\"Jan!\" boomed Heemskerk, forcing his voice through the helmet diaphragm\nand rushing over to his friend. \"I was afraid you were lost!\"\n\nJan struggled to his feet and leaned down to help the boy up.\n\n\"Here's your patient, Pieter,\" he said. \"Hope you have a spacesuit in\nhis size.\"\n\n\"I can find one. And we'll have to hurry for blastoff. But, first, what\nhappened? Even that damned thing ought to get here from Rathole faster\nthan that.\"\n\n\"Had no fuel,\" replied Jan briefly. \"My engines were all right, but I\nhad no power to run them. So I had to pull the engines and rig up a\npower source.\"\n\nHeemskerk stared at the platform. On its railing was rigged a tripod of\nbattered metal pipes, atop which a big four-blade propeller spun slowly\nin what wind was left after it came over the western mountain. Over the\nedges of the platform, running from the two propellers in its base, hung\na series of tattered transmission belts.\n\n\"Power source?\" repeated Heemskerk. \"That?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" replied Jan with dignity. \"The power source any good\nDutchman turns to in an emergency: a windmill!\"\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note\n\nThis etext was produced from _Amazing Science Fiction Stories_ April\n1959.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
