And so nobody but\n baby could see it. And so a couple of men dropped\n out of thin air to check and see if the monster\n was licensed or not. So what's strange about that?_\n\n\nBaby didn't cry all day, because he had a monster for a playmate. But I\ndidn't know he had a playmate, and much less did I know it was a\nmonster. The honest truth is that for the first time since baby was\nborn, I had my nerves under control, and I didn't dare investigate why\nhe wasn't crying. I got all the ironing done--all of it, mind you--and I\ngot Harry's work-clothes mended and I also read three installments of a\nSaturday Evening Post serial I'd been saving. And besides this Mabel, my\nneighbor, and I had a couple or three cups of coffee. We also had a\ngiggling fit. I remember once we went off into hysterics at the picture\nof ourselves we had--two haggard old wrecks of women, worn out at\ntwenty-three from too much work around the house. \"But thank Heavens\nbaby hasn't cried all day!\" I gurgled when we came out of it.\n\n\"Neither has mine,\" said Mabel, who isn't due for six months.\n\n\"Mabel, honest, you kill me,\" I said, \"and excuse me while I comb my\nmessy hair--because I'm _not_ a wreck. Harry said so. He says I'm still\nthe best hunk of female pulchritude he's met since high school--and\nwe've been married two years!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI went into the bathroom leaving Mabel choking hysterically behind me.\nWhen I came out of the bathroom, she was hysterical but in a different\nway. She'd discovered why Harry, Jr., wasn't crying. She'd been in the\nnursery. Her face was white as an egg-shell.\n\n\"He's playing with something,\" she chattered. \"It's _alive_. I heard it\ncooing back.\"\n\nI ran three steps to baby's crib ... one on the corner of Little Jack\nHorner, one on the sheep of Little Bo Peep, one on the cupboard of Old\nMother Hubbard. \"Baby!\" I almost screamed. But baby cooed and gurgled\nand laughed and rocked back and forth on his diapers. He was playing\nwith his teething ring, but something was trying to jerk the teething\nring out of his hands. And baby liked it.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nBaby lost his hold on the teething ring, and fell on his back. The\nteething ring stayed up in the air and then by itself moved toward\nbaby's waving hands and let him get a hold of it.\n\nMabel screeched through her teeth, \"Baby's got it, the monster's got it,\nnow baby's got it!\" She began to collapse.\n\n\"Don't faint,\" I snapped, \"and don't let's play tennis.\" I was shaking.\nI reached into the crib. My hands closed around something that put\nice-water in my vertebrae. It _was_ a monster.\n\n\"It's got fur!\" I whispered. I felt some more. \"And clammy scales!\" I\nlifted it out of the crib. \"And a trunk!\" I was determined to save baby.\nBaby cried!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe got some chairs and sat there for ten minutes close together while\nbaby played with the invisible monster. \"I don't know what to do!\" I\nsaid. \"It's alive. Maybe it's poisonous. But it's friendly. Maybe it's\nanother baby!\"\n\n\"From another dimension,\" said Mabel.\n\n\"Rot,\" I said; I think I picked that up from the detective in the\nSaturday Evening Post serial. \"Let's keep our heads.\"\n\n\"If baby keeps his,\" said my friend Mabel.\n\nThat got me. \"I've got to call Harry,\" I chattered. \"They don't like him\nto be called at work, but I've got to call him.\"\n\n\"You'll just worry him,\" said Mabel. \"Call the police.\"\n\n\"No!\" I said. I felt like crying myself. Baby was so happy. Maybe the\nbaby monster was happy, too. The police would do something awful to it.\nBut what about my maternal instinct? Something told me I simply had to\nsave my baby! \"I've _got_ to call Harry,\" I insisted, and I went to the\n'phone.\n\nThe dial tone sounded peculiar, I remember, but I called Harry's place\nof employment. A brisk female voice cut in:\n\n\"What number are you calling, please?\"\n\n\"CHarlemont 7-890,\" I whispered.\n\n\"Sorry. You must have the wrong dimension.\" There was a click as she\ndisconnected. I sat like a statue. A haggard statue with a greasy\nhousedress on. A statue that hadn't plucked its eyebrows in two months.\nI had a lot of nerve. I was a bad mother, and a poor mistress. And I had\na swell husband, who could lie like a trooper. I wasn't any good, I was\nugly, I was greasy. I cried. \"Mabel,\" I choked.\n\nIt took her a while to get it out of me, and then her blue eyes flashed.\n\"I told you!\" she cried. \"From another dimension!\" In her broken-down\ngreen wedgies she clattered toward the door. I heard her fighting it.\nShe couldn't get it open. Then she tried a window. It opened, but she\ncouldn't stick her hand out. She flung herself around.\n\n\"Stella,\" she said, with a quiver of that good-looking short upper lip\nof hers, \"we're trapped in. We're in the middle of some kind of fantasy.\nIt's a crazy world we're living in, Stella. A-bombs and H-bombs and\nflying saucers and space-flight--it's all the fiction stuff coming true.\nNow we're lost in some other dimension, and I have to get dinner in the\noven.\"\n\n\"Please,\" I mumbled. \"Let's don't get desperate about the wrong things.\"\nI tried all the doors and windows in the house, and it was true. We were\ntrapped in. There was some barrier surrounding the house. There wasn't\nanything to see outside except a kind of grey steam.\n\nWe went back to check on baby. He was still playing with the monster. I\nbent over the crib and held a fluffy, fifty-cent toy bear out. The baby\nmonster took it invisibly out of my hand. He shoved it at baby. Baby\nsquealed so darned happily. And I began to get some perspective.\n\n\"Suspicion is wrong,\" I told Mabel. \"All the time. That's what that\narticle we read a couple months ago in _Your World_ said. Remember you\nand I decided we'd never be suspicious. Maybe that's the reason we're\nhappy--if dirty. We don't suspect anybody of anything if we can help\nit--and now's no time to start. The monster is baby's friend.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMabel shuddered. \"Okay,\" she said. \"But I'm still worried about getting\ndinner in the oven. Bill's liable to--\"\n\n\"Hah, now you're being suspicious,\" I said, lousy with virtue. \"Quit\nworrying. I'm going to call Harry again.\" This time I was a lot calmer.\nI decided to trust the universe a little more. I dialed Harry's number\nagain. A scratchy male voice answered:\n\n\"Sorry, dis dimension is in use. Would ya please get off da line?\"\n\nI dug a few trenches and established a line of fire.\n\n\"Listen,\" I said. \"I'm in trouble.\"\n\n\"A dame,\" he said wonderingly.\n\n\"Yeah, a dame,\" I cried. \"What's so unusual about a dame? Why does every\nmale in Kingdom Come get that note in his voice when he talks with a\ndame? Sure I'm a dame, a good-looking dame! I'd like to punch you in the\neye to prove it!\"\n\nHe laughed. He must have turned away from the 'phone. \"It's a dame.\"\n\n\"Okay, find out what she wants.\"\n\n\"Spill it,\" he said into the 'phone. I spilled it. \"What's that address\nagain?\" he asked. I told him. \"Naw, naw,\" he said impatiently. \"The\nplanet. The _planet_. And the year.\" I told him.\n\nHe must have turned away from the 'phone again, because I heard him say\noff-stage, \"They're only ten years away.\" I was numb. He came back on\nthe line. \"And what's dis about a baby monster? Fur? Scales? A trunk?\nThe size of Harry, Jr.? Ma'am, we'll be there in a jiff,\" and he hung\nup.\n\nMabel was nervously hanging on my ear, but I didn't get a chance to\nanswer her questions. The door in the living room opened and they walked\nin.\n\nFor a second I saw a ship that looked like a cake-pan, hanging in the\ngrey steam. Then they closed the door and grinned at us. Instinctively,\nMabel and I tried to shrink our bust-lines.\n\n\"Hello,\" said the tall one. He scratched at his hairy chest and grinned\nwider. He was carrying a piece of machinery that looked like a camera on\na tripod. \"Lemme introduce myself,\" he said. \"Jake Comstock. We come\nover to do you dames a favor. We'll kick you back where you belong.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" I said, \"I'll bet.\"\n\n\"And this here is Beany Rocine. He's my partner. We--uh--work together.\"\n\n\"Hi dere,\" said Beany. \"Where's da monster?\"\n\n\"Introductions,\" said Jake, casting him a hard look. \"Manners.\"\n\nSo I introduced us. \"I'm Mrs. Weaver,\" I said. \"And this is my neighbor,\nMrs. Aspectia.\"\n\n\"Pleased ta meetcha, girls,\" grinned Jake. \"You, Blondie,\" he was\nlooking at me, \"you must be the one talked on the 'phone. I liked the\nway you handled Beany. Real cute.\" He dropped the tripod thing in a\ncorner, and sidled toward me. \"Now where's this monster?\" he asked,\nslipping his hand around my bare arm and grinning down at me.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI knew better than to play rough, so I just looked down at his hand, and\ndidn't stop looking at it until he took it away. He lost a lot of his\ngrin. \"So where is it?\" he said, his voice turning hard and unpleasant.\n\n\"Don't worry about that,\" I said. \"Matter of fact, I'm getting so the\nmonster doesn't worry me. He's been playing with baby all day and baby\nhasn't objected. The main thing I'd like you gentlemen to do for us is\nto get busy moving us back to our own dimension.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" said Mabel, her hands on her hips. \"And let us know\nright now what the charges are going to be, if any.\"\n\n\"No charge,\" said the runt Beany, staring fascinated at her legs. \"'Cept\nwe're taking da monster wit' us. Real expensive, them monsters. Drinkos,\nthey're called. Dey get lost in da dimensions now and then. Picked one\nup on Pluto fifty years or so acome--or ago.\"\n\n\"Ago?\" I said.\n\n\"Acome,\" he corrected.\n\n\"Listen,\" I said, making up my mind. \"You can't have the monster. He's\nkept baby happy all day. But I'll tell you what I'll do. Tell me what he\neats and what to do for him and I'll keep him. I've got twenty-five\ndollars in poker winnings you can have. Okay--Jake?\"\n\nJake broke out laughing. \"You kids are terrific,\" he said. \"You don't\nknow what the score is. You're cute!\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" I said bitterly. \"You restore my confidence. I feel myself\nblooming under your hungry gaze.\"\n\n\"Those Drinkos are worth a couple million credits, is what I'm getting\nat, and you offer us a stinkin' twenty-five dollars. Tell you what,\nBlondie.\" He winked at me. \"You kids are over-worked. One look and you\ncan tell that. Well, Beany and me have got a little cabin up on\nDimension-L, cut off from everything. The four of us can go there and\nhave a fine old time. We could stay there a month, and still get you\nback here in time to kiss your husbands when they get in from work.\nWhaddya say, Blondie? And you can keep the Drinko!\"\n\n\"We are accepting no propositions this week,\" said Mabel with dignity.\n\n\"Ah-h, a coupla kill-joys,\" growled Beany, wandering off toward the\nhall.\n\nMabel looked at me and then picked up a vase off the mantle over the\nfire-place. I gave her the nod. \"Stay away from that Drinko,\" she warned\nBeany, \"or I'll let you have it.\"\n\nBeany was annoyed. He stopped, looking imploringly at Jake. Jake giggled\nas if the whole thing tickled his sense of humor, and walked cat-footed\ntoward Mabel. She let go the vase with a right-handed swing. He had his\nright arm out stiff in front of him, though, and the vase shied off and\nsmashed against the television set. Then he grabbed Mabel in a bear hug.\n\nThat set me off. I had a yearning for Harry, then. He would have laid\nthese mugs out. And that's all they were--mugs, cheap crooks. I hopped\non one leg, yanking off one of my oxfords. I brought the heel down on\nJake's curly head. But it didn't do a thing for him, except make him\nmad. He brought his arm back, cursing at me. It caught me on my\nlipstick. I remember being surprised that he was actually knocking me\nout. But that's what he did.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen I woke up, the first thing I knew was that Harry, Jr., was\nscreaming. I groggily stood up, and stepped over Mabel, who was just\nbeginning to moan. I went to the nursery and grabbed up my baby. \"Don't\ncry,\" I begged him. \"Don't be mad. I'll get your Drinko back. Those\ndirty thieves, I'll get it back.\" I held him under one arm, his pants\ndripping. I think I looked like a Pekinese, with my hair over my eyes. I\nwent to the 'phone, dialed Harry's number, and got the same routine.\n\n\"I _don't_ have the wrong dimension,\" I cried before the operator could\nhang up. \"This is an emergency. A couple of crooks stole my Drinko.\nPlease get me the dimension-police.\"\n\n\"You have a Drinko?\" the operator asked cautiously. \"There must be some\nmistake. You are calling from Earth? From 1954? I am sorry. Congress\nruled Earth 1954 could not be connected with the dimension-system. It\nwould be impossible for you to own a Drinko.\"\n\n\"Some crooks from 1964 stole my Drinko!\" I insisted.\n\n\"One moment, please. The Supervisor informs me this is an unauthorized\ncall. It will be necessary to conduct a police investigation.\" There\nwere clickings, there were buzzings, there were groups of fuzzy, far-off\nvoices, and finally the police came in.\n\n\"A couple of crooks stole my baby's Drinko!\" I repeated loudly. \"I\ndemand my rights as a dimension-citizen!\"\n\n\"Two thieves confiscated your Drinko,\" a dry voice said. \"Very well.\nDescribe them, please. Describe characteristic phrases, expressions, and\nvoice-intonations also.\" I described them. \"Very good. Did you say Earth\n1954? Excellent. Only a matter of six dimensions and thirty years. We\nshall investigate immediately.\" He hung up.\n\n\"Hi, Stella,\" said Mabel, up on one elbow and looking fuzzily at me.\n\"You think I'll get out of this in time to get Bill's dinner in the\noven? Bill's so darned touchy about dinner.\"\n\n\"Teach him a lesson, then,\" I snapped, disgusted with her, and running\nto the door, because somebody was knocking there. \"Train him. Disappoint\nhim. Break his pattern. Don't have dinner. Good evening, gentlemen,\" I\nsaid as I opened the door. The police came in. They had Beany. They had\nJake.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere were three police. The one in front, a young, nice-looking one,\ntouched his cap and smiled quietly. \"Here's your Drinko, ma'am,\" he\nsaid, but I already knew the Drinko was back. Harry, Jr., stopped\ncrying. He gurgled happily. Somehow, I was willing to bet, he could see\nthe Drinko. I put him on the floor and the policeman put the Drinko on\nthe floor. It was beautiful, those squeals that came from my baby. The\nyoung policeman smiled again, a quiet, tanned smile.\n\n\"We want to thank you, ma'am. These two are the worst criminals in the\ndimension-system. I want you to know you may have the Drinko as a reward\nfor your part in apprehending them. Also, I wish to say that I admire\nyou for your trippo in pretending to be a dimension-citizen, when, of\ncourse, you are not.\"\n\n\"Trippo?\"\n\n\"Spunk, if you prefer.\"\n\n\"Well, I had to get my baby's Drinko back,\" I said.\n\n\"Naturally,\" he smiled. \"Drinkos make wonderful pets. The day may come\nwhen Earth 1954 will be connected with dimension-system--and then more\nDrinkos will be available.\"\n\n\"Can't we,\" I asked, \"just stay alone in our quiet nook of space?\"\n\n\"My thought, too,\" said Mabel, getting to her feet at last and throwing\nher hair back. \"And is there any chance of getting out of here? It's\nexciting, thrilling, and romantic, but Bill still has to eat.\"\n\n\"Immediately, Madam! It is merely a matter of disengaging the\nchrono-beam, which happened to become tangled, in space-time, with the\ngravitonic structure of the neutronic chrono-field.\"\n\n\"Well!\" said Mabel. \"That explains it! And so clearly!\"\n\nThey set up an instrument that looked like the one Jake and Beany had.\nThey sighted along the diagonals of the room and pressed buttons. Then\nthey opened the door. \"In two minutes, ma'am,\" the smiling cop said.\n\"Good day. It is my hope that we shall meet again.\" They disappeared out\nthe door. Sure enough, there was a cake-pan ship hanging in the grey\nsteam. They piled into it and the ship moved off, wobbling, until I\ncouldn't see it any more.\n\nA minute later, the grey steam melted away and so did Mabel.\n\nHarry came home on schedule. \"Baby has hardly cried all day!\" I told him\nhappily. \"What a relief! I got a lot of your old clothes mended and I\nread three installments of the Saturday Evening Post serial.\"\n\n\"Fine!\" said Harry, looking around. \"What else happened?\"\n\n\"Not much,\" I said, deciding to break it to him gradually. \"Except we've\ngot a Drinko.\" I took him into the nursery. Baby was sound asleep. I\nsupposed the Drinko was, too. \"There he is,\" I said, pointing to the\ndepression at the foot of the crib. \"That's the Drinko.\" I told Harry\nthe whole story. He listened with a straight face.\n\n\"Well!\" he said. \"What thrilling adventures you have. Tell me, isn't\nthis sort of thing sometimes too exciting?\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" I said, deciding to feed his stomach before I really tried\nto convince him. \"It all comes under the heading of the drab, routine\nduties of a housewife. Come on now, dinner's ready.\"\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ March 1954.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
