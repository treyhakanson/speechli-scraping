Their minds were busy with Jeff's troubles.\n\n\"You're still the smartest color engineer in television,\" Ann told Jeff\nas they dallied with their food. \"You'll bounce back. Now eat your\nsupper.\"\n\n\"This beanery is too noisy and hot,\" he grumbled. \"I can't eat. Can't\ntalk. Can't think.\" He took a silver pillbox from his pocket and\nfumbled for a black one. Those were vitamin pills; the big red and\nyellow ones were sleeping capsules. He gulped the pill.\n\nAnn looked disapproving in a wifely way. \"Lately you chew pills like\npopcorn,\" she said. \"Do you really need so many?\"\n\n\"I need something. I'm sure losing my grip.\"\n\nAnn stared at him. \"Baby! How silly! Nothing happened, except you lost\nyour lease. You'll build up a better company in a new spot. We're young\nyet.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJeff sighed and glanced around the crowded little restaurant. He wished\nhe could fly away somewhere. At that moment, he met the gaze of the\nmustachioed man at the next table.\n\nThe fellow seemed to be watching him and Ann. Something in his\nconfident gaze made Jeff uneasy. Had they met before?\n\nAnn whispered, \"So you noticed him, too. Maybe he's following us. I\nthink I saw him on the parking lot where we left the car.\"\n\nJeff shrugged his big shoulders. \"If he's following us, he's nuts.\nWe've got no secrets and no money.\"\n\n\"It must be my maddening beauty,\" said Ann.\n\n\"I'll kick him cross-eyed if he starts anything,\" Jeff said. \"I'm just\nin the mood.\"\n\nAnn giggled. \"Honey, what big veins you have! Forget him. Let's talk\nabout the engineering lab you're going to start. And let's eat.\"\n\nHe groaned. \"I lose my appetite every time I think about the building\nbeing sold. It isn't worth the twelve grand. I wouldn't buy it for that\nif I could. What burns me is that, five years ago, I could have bought\nit for two thousand.\"\n\n\"If only we could go back five years.\" She shrugged fatalistically.\n\"But since we can't--\"\n\nThe character at the next table leaned over and spoke to them,\ngrinning. \"You like to get away? You wish to go back?\"\n\nJeff glanced across in annoyance. The man was evidently a salesman,\nwith extra gall.\n\n\"Not now, thanks,\" Jeff said. \"Haven't time.\"\n\nThe man waved his thick hand at the clock, as if to abolish time.\n\"Time? That is nothing. Your little lady. She spoke of go back five\nyears. Maybe I help you.\"\n\nHe spoke in an odd clipped way, obviously a foreigner. His shirt was\nyellow. His suit had a silky sheen. Its peculiar tailoring emphasized\nthe bulges in his stubby, muscular torso.\n\nAnn smiled back at him. \"You talk as if you could take us back to 1952.\nIs that what you really mean?\"\n\n\"Why not? You think this silly. But I can show you.\"\n\nJeff rose to go. \"Mister, you better get to a doctor. Ann, it's time we\nstarted home.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnn laid a hand on his sleeve. \"I haven't finished eating. Let's\nchat with the gent.\" She added in an undertone to Jeff, \"Must be a\npsycho--but sort of an inspired one.\"\n\nThe man said to Ann, \"You are kind lady, I think. Good to crazy people.\nI join you.\"\n\nHe did not wait for consent, but slid into a seat at their table with\nan easy grace that was almost arrogant.\n\n\"You are unhappy in 1957,\" he went on. \"Discouraged. Restless. Why not\ntake trip to another time?\"\n\n\"Why not?\" Ann said gaily. \"How much does it cost?\"\n\n\"Free trial trip. Cost nothing. See whether you like. Then maybe we\ntalk money.\" He handed Jeff a card made of a stiff plastic substance.\n\nJeff glanced at it, then handed it to Ann with a half-smile. It read:\n\n         4-D TRAVEL BEURO\n    Greet Snader, Traffic Ajent\n\n\"Mr. Snader's bureau is different,\" Jeff said to his wife. \"He even\nspells it different.\"\n\nSnader chuckled. \"I come from other time. We spell otherwise.\"\n\n\"You mean you come from the future?\"\n\n\"Just different time. I show you. You come with me?\"\n\n\"Come where?\" Jeff asked, studying Snader's mocking eyes. The man\ndidn't seem a mere eccentric. He had a peculiar suggestion of humor and\nforce.\n\n\"Come on little trip to different time,\" invited Snader. He added\npersuasively, \"Could be back here in hour.\"\n\n\"It would be painless, I suppose?\" Jeff gave it a touch of derision.\n\n\"Maybe not. That is risk you take. But look at me. I make trips every\nday. I look damaged?\"\n\nAs a matter of fact, he did. His thick-fleshed face bore a scar and\nhis nose was broad and flat, as if it had been broken. But Jeff\npolitely agreed that he did not look damaged.\n\nAnn was enjoying this. \"Tell me more, Mr. Snader. How does your time\ntravel work?\"\n\n\"Cannot explain. Same if you are asked how subway train works. Too\ncomplicated.\" He flashed his white teeth. \"You think time travel not\npossible. Just like television not possible to your grandfather.\"\n\nAnn said, \"Why invite us? We're not rich enough for expensive trips.\"\n\n\"Invite many people,\" Snader said quickly. \"Not expensive. You know\nMissing Persons lists, from police? Dozens people disappear. They go\nwith me to other time. Many stay.\"\n\n\"Oh, sure,\" Jeff said. \"But how do you select the ones to invite?\"\n\n\"Find ones like you, Mr. Elliott. Ones who want change, escape.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJeff was slightly startled. How did this fellow know his name was\nElliott?\n\nBefore he could ask, Ann popped another question. \"Mr. Snader, you\nheard us talking. You know we're in trouble because Jeff missed a good\nchance five years ago. Do you claim people can really go back into the\npast and correct mistakes they've made?\"\n\n\"They can go back. What they do when arrive? Depends on them.\"\n\n\"Don't you wish it were true?\" she sighed to Jeff.\n\n\"You afraid to believe,\" said Snader, a glimmer of amusement in his\nrestless eyes. \"Why not try? What you lose? Come on, look at station.\nVery near here.\"\n\nAnn jumped up. \"It might be fun, Jeff. Let's see what he means, if\nanything.\"\n\nJeff's pulse quickened. He too felt a sort of midsummer night's\nmadness--a yearning to forget his troubles. \"Okay, just for kicks. But\nwe go in my car.\"\n\nSnader moved ahead to the cashier's stand. Jeff watched the weasel-like\ngrace of his short, broad body.\n\n\"This is no ordinary oddball,\" Jeff told Ann. \"He's tricky. He's got\nsome gimmick.\"\n\n\"First I just played him along, to see how loony he was,\" Ann said.\n\"Now I wonder who's kidding whom.\" She concluded thoughtfully, \"He's\nkind of handsome, in a tough way.\"\n\n\nII\n\nSnader's \"station\" proved to be a middle-sized, middle-cost home in a\ngood neighborhood. Lights glowed in the windows. Jeff could hear the\nwhisper of traffic on a boulevard a few blocks away. Through the warm\ndusk, he could dimly see the mountains on the horizon. All was peaceful.\n\nSnader unlocked the front door with a key which he drew from a fine\nmetal chain around his neck. He swept open the front door with a\nflourish and beamed at them, but Ann drew back.\n\n\"'Walk into my parlor, said the spider to the fly,'\" she murmured to\nJeff. \"This could be a gambling hell. Or a dope den.\"\n\n\"No matter what kind of clip joint, it can't clip us much,\" he said.\n\"There's only four bucks in my wallet. My guess is it's a 'temple' for\nsome daffy religious sect.\"\n\nThey went in. A fat man smiled at them from a desk in the hall. Snader\nsaid, \"Meet Peter Powers. Local agent of our bureau.\"\n\nThe man didn't get up, but nodded comfortably and waved them toward the\nnext room, after a glance at Snader's key.\n\nThe key opened this room's door, too. Its spring lock snapped shut\nafter them.\n\nThe room was like a doctor's waiting room, with easy chairs along the\nwalls. Its only peculiar aspects were a sign hanging from the middle\nof the ceiling and two movie screens--or were they giant television\nscreens?--occupying a whole wall at either end of the room.\n\nThe sign bore the number 701 in bright yellow on black. Beneath it, an\narrow pointed to the screen on the left with the word _Ante_, and to\nthe right with the word _Post_.\n\nJeff studied the big screens. On each, a picture was in motion. One\nappeared to be moving through a long corridor, lined with seats like\na railroad club car. The picture seemed to rush at them from the left\nwall. When he turned to the right, a similar endless chair-lined\ncorridor moved toward him from that direction.\n\n\"Somebody worked hard on this layout,\" he said to Snader. \"What's it\nfor?\"\n\n\"Time travel,\" said Snader. \"You like?\"\n\n\"Almost as good as Disneyland. These movies represent the stream of\ntime, I suppose?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nInstead of answering, Snader pointed to the screen. The picture showed\na group of people chatting in a fast-moving corridor. As it hurtled\ntoward them, Snader flipped his hand in a genial salute. Two people in\nthe picture waved back.\n\nAnn gasped. \"It was just as if they saw us.\"\n\n\"They did,\" Snader said. \"No movie. Time travelers. In fourth\ndimension. To you, they look like flat picture. To them, we look flat.\"\n\n\"What's he supposed to be?\" Jeff asked as the onrushing picture showed\nthem briefly a figure bound hand and foot, huddled in one of the\nchairs. He stared at them piteously for an instant before the picture\nsurged past.\n\nSnader showed his teeth. \"That was convict from my time. We have\ncriminals, like in your time. But we do not kill. We make them work.\nWhere he going? To end of line. To earliest year this time groove\nreach. About 600 A.D., your calendar. Authorities pick up when\nhe get there. Put him to work.\"\n\n\"What kind of work?\" Jeff asked.\n\n\"Building the groove further back.\"\n\n\"Sounds like interesting work.\"\n\nSnader chortled and slapped him on the back. \"Maybe you see it some\nday, but forget that now. You come with me. Little trip.\"\n\nJeff was perspiring. This was odder than he expected. Whatever the\nfakery, it was clever. His curiosity as a technician made him want to\nknow about it. He asked Snader, \"Where do you propose to go? And how?\"\n\nSnader said, \"Watch me. Then look at other wall.\"\n\nHe moved gracefully to the screen on the left wall, stepped into it and\ndisappeared. It was as if he had slid into opaque water.\n\nJeff and Ann blinked in mystification. Then they remembered his\ninstruction to watch the other screen. They turned. After a moment, in\nthe far distance down the long moving corridor, they could see a stocky\nfigure. The motion of the picture brought him nearer. In a few seconds,\nhe was recognizable as Snader--and as the picture brought him forward,\nhe stepped down out of it and was with them again.\n\n\"Simple,\" Snader said. \"I rode to next station. Then crossed over. Took\nother carrier back here.\"\n\n\"Brother, that's the best trick I've seen in years,\" Jeff said. \"How\ndid you do it? Can I do it, too?\"\n\n\"I show you.\" Grinning like a wildcat, Snader linked his arms with Ann\nand Jeff, and walked them toward the screen. \"Now,\" he said. \"Step in.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJeff submitted to Snader's pressure and stepped cautiously into the\nscreen. Amazingly, he felt no resistance at all, no sense of change or\nmotion. It was like stepping through a fog-bank into another room.\n\nIn fact, that was what they seemed to have done. They were in the\nchair-lined corridor. As Snader turned them around and seated them,\nthey faced another moving picture screen. It seemed to rush through a\ndark tunnel toward a lighted square in the far distance.\n\nThe square grew on the screen. Soon they saw it was another room like\nthe waiting room they had left, except that the number hanging from the\nceiling was 702. They seemed to glide through it. Then they were in the\ndark tunnel again.\n\nAnn was clutching Jeff's arm. He patted her hand. \"Fun, hey? Like Alice\nthrough the looking-glass.\"\n\n\"You really think we're going back in time?\" she whispered.\n\n\"Hardly! But we're seeing a million-dollar trick. I can't even begin to\nfigure it out yet.\"\n\nAnother lighted room grew out of the tunnel on the screen, and when\nthey had flickered through it, another and then another.\n\n\"Mr. Snader,\" Ann said unsteadily, \"how long--how many years back are\nyou taking us?\"\n\nSnader was humming to himself. \"Six years. Station 725 fine place to\nstop.\"\n\nFor a little while, Jeff let himself think it might be true. \"Six years\nago, your dad was alive,\" he mused to Ann. \"If this should somehow be\nreal, we could see him again.\"\n\n\"We could if we went to our house. He lived with us then, remember?\nWould we see ourselves, six years younger? Or would--\"\n\nSnader took Jeff's arm and pulled him to his feet. The screen was\nmoving through a room numbered 724.\n\n\"Soon now,\" Snader grunted happily. \"Then no more questions.\"\n\nHe took an arm of each as he had before. When the screen was filled by\na room with the number 725, he propelled them forward into it.\n\nAgain there was no sense of motion. They had simply stepped through a\nbright wall they could not feel. They found themselves in a replica of\nthe room they had left at 701. On the wall, a picture of the continuous\nclub-car corridor rolled toward them in a silent, endless stream.\n\n\"The same room,\" Ann said in disappointment. \"They just changed the\nnumber. We haven't been anywhere.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSnader was fishing under his shirt for the key. He gave Ann a glance\nthat was almost a leer. Then he carefully unlocked the door.\n\nIn the hall, a motherly old lady bustled up, but Snader brushed past\nher. \"Official,\" he said, showing her the key. \"No lodging.\"\n\nHe unlocked the front door without another word and carefully shut it\nbehind them as Jeff and Ann followed him out of the house.\n\n\"Hey, where's my car?\" Jeff demanded, looking up and down the street.\n\nThe whole street looked different. Where he had parked his roadster,\nthere was now a long black limousine.\n\n\"Your car is in future,\" Snader said briskly. \"Where it belong. Get\nin.\" He opened the door of the limousine.\n\nJeff felt a little flame of excitement licking inside him. Something\nwas happening, he felt. Something exciting and dangerous.\n\n\"Snader,\" he said, \"if you're kidnaping us, you made a mistake. Nobody\non Earth will pay ransom for us.\"\n\nSnader seemed amused. \"You are foolish fellow. Silly talk about ransom.\nYou in different time now.\"\n\n\"When does this gag stop?\" Jeff demanded irritably. \"You haven't fooled\nus. We're still in 1957.\"\n\n\"You are? Look around.\"\n\nJeff looked at the street again. He secretly admitted to himself\nthat these were different trees and houses than he remembered. Even\nthe telephone poles and street lights seemed peculiar, vaguely\nforeign-looking. It must be an elaborate practical joke. Snader had\nprobably ushered them into one house, then through a tunnel and out\nanother house.\n\n\"Get in,\" Snader said curtly.\n\nJeff decided to go along with the hoax or whatever it was. He could\nsee no serious risk. He helped Ann into the back seat and sat beside\nher. Snader slammed the door and slid into the driver's seat. He\nstarted the engine with a roar and they rocketed away from the curb,\nnarrowly missing another car.\n\nJeff yelled, \"Easy, man! Look where you're going!\"\n\nSnader guffawed. \"Tonight, you look where you are going.\"\n\nAnn clung to Jeff. \"Did you notice the house we came out of?\"\n\n\"What about it?\"\n\n\"It looked as though they were afraid people might try to break in.\nThere were bars at the windows.\"\n\n\"Lots of houses are built that way, honey. Let's see, where are we?\" He\nglanced at house numbers. \"This is the 800 block. Remember that. And\nthe street--\" He peered up at a sign as they whirled around a corner.\n\"The street is Green Thru-Way. I never heard of a street like that.\"\n\n\nIII\n\nThey were headed back toward what should have been the boulevard. The\ncar zoomed through a cloverleaf turn and up onto a broad freeway. Jeff\nknew for certain there was no freeway there in 1957--nor in any earlier\nyear. But on the horizon, he could see the familiar dark bulk of the\nmountains. The whole line of moonlit ridges was the same as always.\n\n\"Ann,\" he said slowly, \"I think this is for real. Somehow I guess we\nescaped from 1957. We've been transported in time.\"\n\nShe squeezed his arm. \"If I'm dreaming, don't wake me! I was scared a\nminute ago. But now, oh, boy!\"\n\n\"Likewise. But I still wonder what Snader's angle is.\" He leaned\nforward and tapped the driver on his meaty shoulder. \"You brought us\ninto the future instead of the past, didn't you?\"\n\nIt was hard to know whether Snader was sleepy or just bored, but he\nshrugged briefly to show there was no reply coming. Then he yawned.\n\nJeff smiled tightly. \"I guess we'll find out in good time. Let's sit\nback and enjoy the strangest ride of our lives.\"\n\nAs the limousine swept along through the traffic, there were plenty\nof big signs for turn-offs, but none gave any hint where they were.\nThe names were unfamiliar. Even the language seemed grotesque. \"Rite\nChannel for Creepers,\" he read. \"Yaw for Torrey Rushway\" flared at him\nfrom a fork in the freeway.\n\n\"This can't be the future,\" Ann said. \"This limousine is almost new,\nbut it doesn't even have an automatic gear shift--\"\n\nShe broke off as the car shot down a ramp off the freeway and pulled up\nin front of an apartment house. Just beyond was a big shopping center,\nablaze with lights and swarming with shoppers. Jeff did not recognize\nit, in spite of his familiarity with the city.\n\nSnader bounded out, pulled open the rear door and jerked his head in a\ncommanding gesture. But Jeff did not get out. He told Snader, \"Let's\nhave some answers before we go any further.\"\n\nSnader gave him a hard grin. \"You hear everything upstairs.\"\n\nThe building appeared harmless enough. Jeff looked thoughtfully at Ann.\n\nShe said, \"It's just an apartment house. We've come this far. Might as\nwell go in and see what's there.\"\n\nSnader led them in, up to the sixth floor in an elevator and along a\ncorridor with heavy carpets and soft gold lights. He knocked on a door.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA tall, silver-haired, important-looking man opened it and greeted them\nheartily.\n\n\"Solid man, Greet!\" he exclaimed. \"You're a real scratcher! And is this\nour sharp?\" He gave Jeff a friendly but appraising look.\n\n\"Just what you order,\" Snader said proudly. \"His name--Jeff Elliott.\nFine sharp. Best in his circuit. He brings his lifemate, too. Ann\nElliott.\"\n\nThe old man rubbed his smooth hands together. \"Prime! I wish joy,\" he\nsaid to Ann and Jeff. \"I'm Septo Kersey. Come in. Bullen's waiting.\"\n\nHe led them into a spacious drawing room with great windows looking out\non the lights of the city. There was a leather chair in a corner, and\nin it sat a heavy man with a grim mouth. He made no move, but grunted\na perfunctory \"Wish joy\" when Kersey introduced them. His cold eyes\nstudied Jeff while Kersey seated them in big chairs.\n\nSnader did not sit down, however. \"No need for me now,\" he said, and\nmoved toward the door with a mocking wave at Ann.\n\nBullen nodded. \"You get the rest of your pay when Elliott proves out.\"\n\n\"Here, wait a minute!\" Jeff called. But Snader was gone.\n\n\"Sit still,\" Bullen growled to Jeff. \"You understand radioptics?\"\n\nThe blood went to Jeff's head. \"My business is television, if that's\nwhat you mean. What's this about?\"\n\n\"Tell him, Kersey,\" the big man said, and stared out the window.\n\nKersey began, \"You understand, I think, that you have come back in\ntime. About six years back.\"\n\n\"That's a matter of opinion, but go on.\"\n\n\"I am general manager of Continental Radioptic Combine, owned by Mr.\nDumont Bullen.\" He nodded toward the big man. \"Chromatics have not\nyet been developed here in connection with radioptics. They are well\nunderstood in your time, are they not?\"\n\n\"What's chromatics? Color television?\"\n\n\"Exactly. You are an expert in--ah--colored television, I think.\"\n\nJeff nodded. \"So what?\"\n\nThe old man beamed at him. \"You are here to work for our company. You\nwill enable us to be first with chromatics in this time wave.\"\n\nJeff stood up. \"Don't tell me who I'll work for.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBullen slapped a big fist on the arm of his chair. \"No fog about this!\nYou're bought and paid for, Elliott! You'll get a fair labor contract,\nbut you do what I say!\"\n\n\"Why, the man thinks he owns you.\" Ann laughed shakily.\n\n\"You'll find my barmen know their law,\" Bullen said. \"This isn't the\nway I like to recruit. But it was only way to get a man with your\nknowledge.\"\n\nKersey said politely, \"You are here illegally, with no immigrate\npermit or citizen file. Therefore you cannot get work. But Mr. Bullen\nhas taken an interest in your trouble. Through his influence, you can\nmake a living. We even set aside an apartment in this building for you\nto live in. You are really very luxe, do you see?\"\n\nJeff's legs felt weak. These highbinders seemed brutally confident. He\nwondered how he and Ann would find their way home through the strange\nstreets. But he put on a bold front.\n\n\"I don't believe your line about time travel and I don't plan to work\nfor you,\" he said. \"My wife and I are walking out right now. Try and\nstop us, legally or any other way.\"\n\nKersey's smooth old face turned hard. But, unexpectedly, Bullen\nchuckled deep in his throat. \"Good pop and bang. Like to see it. Go\non, walk out. You hang in trouble, call up here--Butterfly 9, ask for\nBullen. Whole exchange us. I'll meet you here about eleven tomorrow\npre-noon.\"\n\n\"Don't hold your breath. Let's go, Ann.\"\n\nWhen they were on the sidewalk, Ann took a deep breath. \"We made it.\nFor a minute, I thought there'd be a brawl. Why did they let us go?\"\n\n\"No telling. Maybe they're harmless lunatics--or practical jokers.\" He\nlooked over his shoulder as they walked down the street, but there was\nno sign of pursuit. \"It's a long time since supper.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHer hand was cold in his and her face was white. To take her mind off\ntheir problem, he ambled toward the lighted shop windows.\n\n\"Look at that sign,\" he said, pointing to a poster over a display of\nneckties. \"'Sleek neck-sashes, only a Dick and a dollop!' How do they\nexpect to sell stuff with that crazy lingo?\"\n\n\"It's jive talk. They must cater to the high-school crowd.\" Ann\nglanced nervously at the strolling people around them. \"Jeff, where\nare we? This isn't any part of the city I've ever seen. It doesn't\neven look much like America.\" Her voice rose. \"The way the women are\ndressed--it's not old-fashioned, just different.\"\n\n\"Baby, don't be scared. This is an adventure. Let's have fun.\" He\npressed her hand soothingly and pulled her toward a lunch counter.\n\nIf the haberdasher's sign was jive, the restaurant spoke the same\njargon. The signs on the wall and the bill of fare were baffling. Jeff\npondered the list of beef shingles, scorchers, smack sticks and fruit\nchills, until he noticed that a couple at the counter were eating what\nclearly were hamburgers--though the \"buns\" looked more like tortillas.\n\nJeff jerked his thumb at them and told the waitress, \"Two, please.\"\n\nWhen the sandwiches arrived, they were ordinary enough. He and Ann ate\nin silence. A feeling of foreboding hung over them.\n\nWhen they finished, the clerk gave him a check marked 1/20. Jeff looked\nat it thoughtfully, shrugged and handed it to the cashier with two\ndollar bills.\n\nThe man at the desk glanced at them and laughed. \"Stage money, eh?\"\n\n\"No, that's good money,\" Jeff assured him with a rather hollow smile.\n\"They're just new bills, that's all.\"\n\nThe cashier picked one up and looked at it curiously. \"I'm afraid it's\nno good here,\" he said, and pushed it back.\n\nThe bottom dropped out of Jeff's stomach. \"What kind of money do you\nwant? This is all I have.\"\n\nThe cashier's smile faded. He caught the eye of a man in uniform on one\nof the stools. The uniform was dark green, but the man acted like a\npoliceman. He loomed up beside Jeff.\n\n\"What's the rasper?\" he demanded. Other customers, waiting to pay their\nchecks, eyed Jeff curiously.\n\n\"I guess I'm in trouble,\" Jeff told him. \"I'm a stranger here and I got\nsomething to eat under the impression that my money was legal tender.\nDo you know where I can exchange it?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe officer picked up the dollar bill and fingered it with evident\ninterest. He turned it over and studied the printing. \"United States of\nAmerica,\" he read aloud. \"What are those?\"\n\n\"It's the name of the country I come from,\" Jeff said carefully.\n\"I--uh--got on the wrong train, apparently, and must have come further\nthan I thought. What's the name of this place?\"\n\n\"This is Costa, West Goodland, in the Continental Federation. Say, you\nmust come from an umpty remote part of the world if you don't know\nabout this country.\" His eyes narrowed. \"Where'd you learn to speak\nFederal, if you come from so far?\"\n\nJeff said helplessly, \"I can't explain, if you don't know about the\nUnited States. Listen, can you take me to a bank, or some place where\nthey know about foreign exchange?\"\n\nThe policeman scowled. \"How'd you get into this country, anyway? You\ngot immigrate clearance?\"\n\nAn angry muttering started among the bystanders.\n\nThe policeman made up his mind. \"You come with me.\"\n\nAt the police station, Jeff put his elbows dejectedly on the high\ncounter while the policeman talked to an officer in charge. Some men\nwhom Jeff took for reporters got up from a table and eased over to\nlisten.\n\n\"I don't know whether to charge them with fakemake, bumsy, peekage or\nlunate,\" the policeman said as he finished.\n\nHis superior gave Jeff a long puzzled stare.\n\nJeff sighed. \"I know it sounds impossible, but a man brought me in\nsomething he claimed was a time traveler. You speak the same language I\ndo--more or less--but everything else is kind of unfamiliar. I belong\nin the United States, a country in North America. I can't believe I'm\nso far in the future that the United States has been forgotten.\"\n\nThere ensued a long, confused, inconclusive interrogation.\n\nThe man behind the desk asked questions which seemed stupid to Jeff and\ngot answers which probably seemed stupid to him.\n\nThe reporters quizzed Jeff gleefully. \"Come out, what are you\nadvertising?\" they kept asking. \"Who got you up to this?\"\n\nThe police puzzled over his driver's license and the other cards in his\nwallet. They asked repeatedly about the lack of a \"Work License,\" which\nJeff took to be some sort of union card. Evidently there was grave\ndoubt that he had any legal right to be in the country.\n\nIn the end, Jeff and Ann were locked in separate cells for the night.\nJeff groaned and pounded the bars as he thought of his wife, imprisoned\nand alone in a smelly jail. After hours of pacing the cell, he lay down\nin the cot and reached automatically for his silver pillbox. Then he\nhesitated.\n\nIn past weeks, his insomnia had grown worse and worse, so that lately\nhe had begun taking stronger pills. After a longing glance at the\nbig red and yellow capsules, he put the box away. Whatever tomorrow\nbrought, it wouldn't find him slow and drowsy.\n\n\nIV\n\nHe passed a wakeful night. In the early morning, he looked up to see a\nlittle man with a briefcase at his cell door.\n\n\"Wish joy, Mr. Elliott,\" the man said coolly. \"I am one of Mr. Bullen's\nbarmen. You know, represent at law? He sent me to arrange your release,\nif you are ready to be reasonable.\"\n\nJeff lay there and put his hands behind his head. \"I doubt if I'm\nready. I'm comfortable here. By the way, how did you know where I was?\"\n\n\"No problem. When we read in this morning's newspapers about a man\nclaiming to be a time traveler, we knew.\"\n\n\"All right. Now start explaining. Until I understand where I am, Bullen\nisn't getting me out of here.\"\n\nThe lawyer smiled and sat down. \"Mr. Kersey told you yesterday--you've\ngone back six years. But you'll need some mental gymnastics to\nunderstand. Time is a dimension, not a stream of events like a movie\nfilm. A film never changes. Space does--and time does. For example, if\na movie showed a burning house at Sixth and Main, would you expect to\nfind a house burning whenever you returned to that corner?\"\n\n\"You mean to say that if I went back to 1865, I wouldn't find the Civil\nWar was over and Lincoln had been assassinated?\"\n\n\"If you go back to the time you call 1865--which is most easily\ndone--you will find that the people there know nothing of a Lincoln or\nthat war.\"\n\nJeff looked blank. \"What are they doing then?\"\n\nThe little man spread his hands. \"What are the people doing now at\nSixth and Main? Certainly not the same things they were doing the day\nof the fire. We're talking about a dimension, not an event. Don't you\ngrasp the difference between the two?\"\n\n\"Nope. To me, 1865 means the end of the Civil War. How else can you\nspeak of a point in time except by the events that happened then?\"\n\n\"Well, if you go to a place in three-dimensional space--say, a lake\nin the mountains--how do you identify that place? By looking for\nlandmarks. It doesn't matter that an eagle is soaring over a mountain\npeak. That's only an event. The peak is the landmark. You follow me?\"\n\n\"So far. Keep talking.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe little man looked pleased. \"Very well. In the fourth\ndimension--which is time--you do the same thing. You look around to see\nwhat is visible where you are. My contemporaries can see that freedom\nis unnecessary, that time travel is practical. Your people have not\nreached that place in time yet. But yours can see the technical facts\nabout color television. Those facts are not visible yet to anyone here.\"\n\n\"You mean that these inventions--\"\n\n\"Oh, no, no, no, Mr. Elliott,\" the little man said indignantly. \"Don't\ncall them inventions. There are no inventions. None. There are only\ntruths--scientific principles waiting through eternity for someone to\ndiscover them.\"\n\n\"I must be dense, but--\"\n\n\"Did your Columbus invent America? Did someone invent fire? The\npossibility of time travel, of color television, of any phase of social\nprogress--these are facts. They stand up in the time dimension like\nmountains. Waves of humanity meander through the time dimension like\ncaravans of immigrants crossing a continent. The first man in any wave\nto see the mountain peak claims that he 'invented' it. Soon it is\nclearly visible to everyone. While the people of my wave know of time\ntravel, there are human caravans, following us many years back in time,\njust now discovering steam.\"\n\n\"Then the reason your people won't accept my money--\"\n\n\"Yah.\" The little lawyer nodded. \"Your money is an outgrowth of your\nhistory. It bears the name your people gave to the society they\nbuilt--the United States. This has no meaning to a different wave of\nhumanity, with a different history. These people here have reached this\npoint in time six years behind the humanity you traveled with.\"\n\n\"Can I get back to my own time, my own wave of humanity?\"\n\n\"Not unless you know how.\" The lawyer grinned. \"To be perfectly frank,\nMr. Elliott, there is no hope of your going back. Either work for\nBullen or live out your life in a mental institution. No one else will\ngive you work and no one will believe your story.\"\n\nJeff clamped his teeth. If a crook like Snader could move freely back\nand forth in time, there must be a way for Jeff to do it. Meanwhile, he\nwould pretend to be a humble and obedient servant.\n\n\"Okay,\" he said to the lawyer. \"I'm convinced. Get me out.\"\n\n\"Snader is waiting with a car,\" the man said. \"He'll meet you and your\nwife outside. I'll free her at once, then go about my business.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSnader was standing beside the limousine. He looked Ann up and down. \"I\nlike you, little lady. Soon I know you better.\"\n\nJeff felt his temper rise. \"You sure fooled us, didn't you, Snader?\"\n\n\"I warned you. There was risk.\"\n\nAnn's voice was steady. \"Jeff, where are we going now?\"\n\n\"Back to Bullen. I understand the setup now. Maybe we'd better play\nball with him.\"\n\n\"Did you find out what place this is?\"\n\n\"Yes--well, sort of. Here's a rough rundown. Incredible as it seems,\nwe really are in a past time period--different from our own past. This\nperiod doesn't have color TV yet. Bullen wants to be first on the\nmarket with it. So he sent our pal Greet Snader here to pick a man in\nfuture time who had already mastered TV and sell him to Bullen as a\ncaptive scientist. I imagine Snader raids the future for many experts.\"\n\nSnader stepped up to him with a dangerous smile. \"All right, big wit.\nTell me my business. Tell me all about it.\"\n\n\"You heard me. You're in the slave business.\" The blood throbbed in\nJeff's head.\n\n\"You don't like?\" Snader's scarred face looked fierce and gloating.\n\"Maybe you shovel coal from now. Or wipe floors.\"\n\nJeff saw policemen watching from the jail entrance. He clamped his\nmouth shut.\n\n\"Don't be excitable or you get hurt,\" Snader advised. \"We own you. We\ngave you a break. Remember that, wise boy. You ready now?\"\n\nJeff nodded silently.\n\nSnader playfully twisted Jeff's ear and shoved him into the limousine.\n\"Don't tell me anything. Then I don't hurt you.\"\n\n\nV\n\nBetween Snader and Ann in the front seat, Jeff held Ann's hand and\nwinked encouragingly at her.\n\n\"Snader, I guess you're right,\" he said. \"This is a good deal for me.\nI was sort of washed up in my own time.\"\n\n\"Now you smart,\" Snader said. \"Your little lady? She smart, too?\"\n\n\"Yep. By the way, how come you got us out so early? It's only nine\no'clock. Bullen said he'd expect me at eleven.\"\n\n\"We go to time station first,\" Snader explained shortly. \"I pick up\ndocuments there. Breakfast there.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Jeff said cheerfully. A plan was taking shape in his mind. \"All\nI'm worried about is my speed-up pills. Can I get some at the station?\nI'm almost out.\" He pressed Ann's knee warningly.\n\n\"Speed-up pills?\" Snader looked suspicious--but then, he always did.\n\"What you mean?\"\n\n\"Don't you have speed-up tablets?\" Jeff put surprise in his voice.\n\"Stuff to activate the half of the brain that normally doesn't work.\nYou _must_ have them.\"\n\n\"What they look like?\"\n\nJeff fumbled for his silver pillbox. \"They're the big red and yellow\ncapsules.\" He handed the box to Snader. \"Don't spill them. I only have\nthree left. Where can I get more like those? I won't be nearly as good\nwithout them.\"\n\nKeeping one hand on the wheel, Snader glanced down. The box had a\njumble of black vitamin pills and red and yellow sleeping tablets.\n\n\"You say these big ones help brain?\" he asked warily.\n\n\"They speed up the reflexes--they make everything seem clear and easy.\nPlease give them back before you spill them.\"\n\nSnader thumbed the red and yellow capsules out and handed the box back\nwithout them. \"I keep these.\" He moved his head craftily to watch\nJeff's face in the mirror.\n\nJeff was ready. He registered rage and fear. \"Gimme those!\" he shouted.\n\"I need them.\"\n\nSnader laughed. \"Don't tell me orders. Easy now. You want to wreck car?\"\n\n\"I'll wreck us all if you don't give those back!\" He grabbed Snader's\nhand.\n\nAnn screamed as the car swerved, and horns blared from behind. Snader\nclapped the capsules into his mouth and gripped the wheel with both\nhands.\n\n\"I take what I want,\" he said, gulping down the pills. \"You give\ntrouble, I turn you over to police.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJeff slumped down with a groan and buried his face in his hands to hide\na grin. It had worked. How long would the nembutal take to hit Snader?\nIt might act too fast. Jeff wondered what he could do then.\n\nLuckily, there was only a short distance to go. Even so, the car was\nweaving as they whirled off the express road into Green Thru-Way. When\nthey pulled up in front of the barred house, Snader tumbled out and\nlurched up the walk without a glance at his prisoners.\n\nJeff and Ann followed, and Jeff stood close behind while Snader fumbled\ninside his shirt for the key. When he found it and reached toward the\ndoor, his knees buckled and Jeff caught him.\n\n\"The key, Ann,\" Jeff whispered. \"Pull the cord over his head and unlock\nthe door.\"\n\nAnn clawed at it while Jeff supported the weight of Snader's body. In a\nmoment, she had the door open and they were inside.\n\nThe old housekeeper bustled in as Jeff half-dragged and half-lifted\nSnader across the living room.\n\n\"It's nothing serious,\" Jeff told her calmly. \"He often has these\nattacks. He'll be all right in a few minutes, and then I'll start him\noff home.\"\n\n\"Oh, the poor man,\" she clucked. \"Such a ghast. Can I get you anything?\"\n\n\"Get us some hot water, mixed with mustard and soda,\" Jeff said, hoping\nthis would keep her busy for several minutes. She hurried away.\n\nAnn unlocked the door into the inner room and Jeff lugged the slave\ntrader inside. On the two screens, the endless chair-lined corridors\nstill fled toward them.\n\nWhen the door clicked shut, Jeff let Snader slide to the floor. Swiftly\nhe went through the man's pockets and felt in the lining of his clothes\nfor hidden documents. Papers, wallet, car-keys, a big stiff card that\nseemed to be some kind of passport--Jeff stuffed everything into his\nown pockets.\n\n\"Hurry, Jeff,\" Ann begged. \"Why waste time emptying his pockets?\"\n\n\"So he can't come back and bother us,\" Jeff said. \"I'm sending\nthis joker on a one-way ride. He'll never be able to prove to the\nauthorities who he is.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSeveral pictures hung on the wall. Jeff jerked them down and used the\nwire to tie Snader's feet and wrists. He tore some draperies to bind\nhim tighter. When the body was trussed like a turkey, Jeff heaved it\nto his shoulder. With one lunge, he threw the unconscious man straight\ninto the screen. Snader vanished.\n\n\"What happens when he wakes up?\" Ann shakily wanted to know.\n\nJeff dusted himself off. \"He's headed to the end of the line,\" he said\nharshly. \"Remember? He told us about it. Without credentials, he'll\nland in the convict gang, down around the year 600 A.D. That's\na bad time on this continent. Men who work there don't return--they\nhelp build back the time groove.\"\n\nAnn smiled triumphantly. \"Good for you! He deserved it. Imagine running\na commercial kidnaping enterprise! And now we can ride home, can't we?\"\n\nJeff, beginning to enjoy himself, shook his head. \"Not just yet. First\nI've got a date with Mr. Bullen.\"\n\nWhen they rapped on Bullen's door, Kersey welcomed them with an amused\nsmile.\n\n\"We thought you would be back,\" he purred. \"Where is Snader?\"\n\nJeff brushed past him to the drawing room, where Bullen sat by the\nwindow.\n\n\"I've decided to help you, Bullen,\" Jeff said.\n\nBullen nodded his big head. \"Naturally.\"\n\n\"But I name my own price. What do you pay Kersey?\"\n\nBullen looked up with a grim smile. \"Fifty thousand a year. I wonder\nnow if he worths it.\"\n\n\"What's that? Dollars?\"\n\n\"We call them fiscals. Probably somehow much the same. Why?\"\n\n\"Listen, Bullen. If I help introduce color TV, there'll be big money\nin it. I won't be a hog. You pay me forty thousand a year until we go\ninto production. Then we'll make a new deal, giving me a royalty on\nsales.\"\n\nKersey's face was scarlet. \"You young greenshoot! Who do you think you\nare? You'll work for nothing, if we say so.\"\n\n\"Guess again,\" Jeff said. \"Your slave trader won't be bringing any more\nengineers for you. So you take me at my price--or nobody.\"\n\nThe big man laughed. \"You got rid of Snader, eh? Well, well. He was a\nrogue. I thought he would run into trouble soon or late.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKersey swore, but Bullen seemed to grasp the situation and waved him\nto silence. \"I like your fire, young man. With chromatics, we'll make\nmillions, so you're worth forty thousand plus royalties. Am I true in\nthinking you won't want the apartment I reserved for you?\"\n\n\"Right. We'll retain our home in my own time. I'll commute to work here\nevery morning--it's quicker than commuting to the city in my own time.\"\n\n\"In your thorough way,\" Kersey said sarcastically, \"you have doubtless\nfigured out how you can spend our money back in your time.\"\n\n\"I've thought about it,\" Jeff agreed. \"There will be something I can\nconvert it into and carry back. Diamonds, maybe.\"\n\nBullen laughed again. \"You're solid, my boy. Get his work papers ready,\nKersey. These young people want to get home. I'll take Jeff to the\nfactory when he comes workward in the morning.\"\n\nJeff stood up. \"See you tomorrow, Bullen. Come on, Ann. We're going\nhome--home to our own time.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Butterfly 9, by Donald Keith\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK BUTTERFLY 9 ***\n\n***** This file should be named 51167.txt or 51167.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/1/1/6/51167/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
