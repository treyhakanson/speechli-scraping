The general had that\nquizzical expression on his face, the look that meant he was about to do\nsomething decisive.\n\n\"Would you like to see the problem first-hand?\" the general asked,\ninnocently.\n\nThe CIA man took a quick look at his wristwatch. \"O.K., if it doesn't\ntake too long. It's late enough already.\"\n\n\"It won't take very long, will it, Ford?\" the general said, getting out\nof his chair.\n\n\"Not very long,\" Ford agreed. \"Only a lifetime.\"\n\nThe CIA man grunted as they went to the doorway and left the general's\noffice. Going down the dark, deserted hallway, their footsteps echoed\nhollowly.\n\n\"I can't overemphasize the seriousness of the problem,\" General LeRoy\nsaid to the CIA man. \"Eight ranking members of the General Staff have\neither resigned their commissions or gone straight to the violent ward\nafter just one session with the computer.\"\n\nThe CIA man scowled. \"Is this area Secure?\"\n\nGeneral LeRoy's face turned red. \"This entire building is as Secure as\nany edifice in the Free World, mister. And it's empty. We're the only\nliving people inside here at this hour. I'm not taking any chances.\"\n\n\"Just want to be sure.\"\n\n\"Perhaps if I explain the computer a little more,\" Ford said, changing\nthe subject, \"you'll know what to expect.\"\n\n\"Good idea,\" said the man from CIA.\n\n\"We told you that this is the most modern, most complex and delicate\ncomputer in the world ... nothing like it has ever been attempted\nbefore--anywhere.\"\n\n\"I know that They don't have anything like it,\" the CIA man agreed.\n\n\"And you also know, I suppose, that it was built to simulate actual war\nsituations. We fight wars in this computer ... wars with missiles and\nbombs and gas. Real wars, complete down to the tiniest detail. The\ncomputer tells us what will actually happen to every missile, every city,\nevery man ... who dies, how many planes are lost, how many trucks will\nfail to start on a cold morning, whether a battle is won or lost ...\"\n\nGeneral LeRoy interrupted. \"The computer runs these analyses for both\nsides, so we can see what's happening to Them, too.\"\n\nThe CIA man gestured impatiently. \"War games simulations aren't new.\nYou've been doing them for years.\"\n\n\"Yes, but this machine is different,\" Ford pointed out. \"It not only\ngives a much more detailed war game. It's the next logical step in the\ndevelopment of machine-simulated war games.\" He hesitated dramatically.\n\n\"Well, what is it?\"\n\n\"We've added a variation of the electro-encephalograph ...\"\n\nThe CIA man stopped walking. \"The electro-what?\"\n\n\"Electro-encephalograph. You know, a recording device that reads the\nelectrical patterns of your brain. Like the electro-cardiograph.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\n\"But you see, we've given the EEG a reverse twist. Instead of using a\nmachine that makes a recording of the brain's electrical wave output,\nwe've developed a device that will take the computer's readout tapes,\nand turn them into electrical patterns that are put _into_ your brain!\"\n\n\"I don't get it.\"\n\nGeneral LeRoy took over. \"You sit at the machine's control console. A\nhelmet is placed over your head. You set the machine in operation. You\n_see_ the results.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Ford went on. \"Instead of reading rows of figures from the\ncomputer's printer ... you actually see the war being fought. Complete\nvisual and auditory hallucinations. You can watch the progress of the\nbattles, and as you change strategy and tactics you can see the results\nbefore your eyes.\"\n\n\"The idea, originally, was to make it easier for the General Staff to\nvisualize strategic situations,\" General LeRoy said.\n\n\"But every one who's used the machine has either resigned his commission\nor gone insane,\" Ford added.\n\nThe CIA man cocked an eye at LeRoy. \"You've used the computer.\"\n\n\"Correct.\"\n\n\"And you have neither resigned nor cracked up.\"\n\nGeneral LeRoy nodded. \"I called you in.\"\n\nBefore the CIA man could comment, Ford said, \"The computer's right\ninside this doorway. Let's get this over with while the building is\nstill empty.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey stepped in. The physicist and the general showed the CIA man\nthrough the room-filling rows of massive consoles.\n\n\"It's all transistorized and subminiaturized, of course,\" Ford\nexplained. \"That's the only way we could build so much detail into the\nmachine and still have it small enough to fit inside a single building.\"\n\n\"A single building?\"\n\n\"Oh yes; this is only the control section. Most of this building is\ntaken up by the circuits, the memory banks, and the rest of it.\"\n\n\"Hm-m-m.\"\n\n[Illustration: ILLUSTRATED BY SCHELLING]\n\nThey showed him finally to a small desk, studded with control buttons\nand dials. The single spotlight above the desk lit it brilliantly, in\nharsh contrast to the semidarkness of the rest of the room.\n\n\"Since you've never run the computer before,\" Ford said, \"General LeRoy\nwill do the controlling. You just sit and watch what happens.\"\n\nThe general sat in one of the well-padded chairs and donned a grotesque\nheadgear that was connected to the desk by a half-dozen wires. The CIA\nman took his chair slowly.\n\nWhen they put one of the bulky helmets on him, he looked up at them,\nsquinting a little in the bright light. \"This ... this isn't going\nto ... well, do me any damage, is it?\"\n\n\"My goodness, no,\" Ford said. \"You mean mentally? No, of course not.\nYou're not on the General Staff, so it shouldn't ... it won't ... affect\nyou the way it did the others. Their reaction had nothing to do with the\ncomputer _per se_ ...\"\n\n\"Several civilians have used the computer with no ill effects,\" General\nLeRoy said. \"Ford has used it many times.\"\n\nThe CIA man nodded, and they closed the transparent visor over his face.\nHe sat there and watched General LeRoy press a series of buttons, then\nturn a dial.\n\n\"Can you hear me?\" The general's voice came muffled through the helmet.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said.\n\n\"All right. Here we go. You're familiar with Situation One-Two-One?\nThat's what we're going to be seeing.\"\n\nSituation One-Two-One was a standard war game. The CIA man was well\nacquainted with it. He watched the general flip a switch, then sit back\nand fold his arms over his chest. A row of lights on the desk console\nbegan blinking on and off, one, two, three ... down to the end of the\nrow, then back to the beginning again, on and off, on and off ...\n\nAnd then, somehow, he could see it!\n\nHe was poised incredibly somewhere in space, and he could see it all in\na funny, blurry-double-sighted, dream-like way. He seemed to be seeing\nseveral pictures and hearing many voices, all at once. It was all mixed\nup, and yet it made a weird kind of sense.\n\nFor a panicked instant he wanted to rip the helmet off his head. _It's\nonly an illusion_, he told himself, forcing calm on his unwilling\nnerves. _Only an illusion._\n\nBut it seemed strangely real.\n\nHe was watching the Gulf of Mexico. He could see Florida off to his\nright, and the arching coast of the southeastern United States. He could\neven make out the Rio Grande River.\n\nSituation One-Two-One started, he remembered, with the discovery of\nmissile-bearing Enemy submarines in the Gulf. Even as he watched the\nwhole area--as though perched on a satellite--he could see, underwater\nand close-up, the menacing shadowy figure of a submarine gliding through\nthe crystal blue sea.\n\nHe saw, too, a patrol plane as it spotted the submarine and sent an\nurgent radio warning.\n\nThe underwater picture dissolved in a bewildering burst of bubbles. A\nmissile had been launched. Within seconds, another burst--this time a\nnuclear depth charge--utterly destroyed the submarine.\n\nIt was confusing. He was everyplace at once. The details were\noverpowering, but the total picture was agonizingly clear.\n\nSix submarines fired missiles from the Gulf of Mexico. Four were\nimmediately sunk, but too late. New Orleans, St. Louis and three Air\nForce bases were obliterated by hydrogen-fusion warheads.\n\nThe CIA man was familiar with the opening stages of the war. The first\nmissile fired at the United States was the signal for whole fleets of\nmissiles and bombers to launch themselves at the Enemy. It was confusing\nto see the world at once; at times he could not tell if the fireball and\nmushroom cloud was over Chicago or Shanghai, New York or Novosibirsk,\nBaltimore or Budapest.\n\nIt did not make much difference, really. They all got it in the first\nfew hours of the war; as did London and Moscow, Washington and Peking,\nDetroit and Delhi, and many, many more.\n\nThe defensive systems on all sides seemed to operate well, except that\nthere were never enough anti-missiles. Defensive systems were expensive\ncompared to attack rockets. It was cheaper to build a deterrent than to\ndefend against it.\n\nThe missiles flashed up from submarines and railway cars, from\nunderground silos and stratospheric jets; secret ones fired off\nautomatically when a certain airbase command post ceased beaming out a\nrestraining radio signal. The defensive systems were simply overloaded.\nAnd when the bombs ran out, the missiles carried dust and germs and gas.\nOn and on. For six days and six firelit nights. Launch, boost, coast,\nre-enter, death.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd now it was over, the CIA man thought. The missiles were all gone.\nThe airplanes were exhausted. The nations that had built the weapons no\nlonger existed. By all the rules he knew of, the war should have been\nended.\n\nYet the fighting did not end. The machine knew better. There were still\nmany ways to kill an enemy. Time-tested ways. There were armies fighting\nin four continents, armies that had marched overland, or splashed ashore\nfrom the sea, or dropped out of the skies.\n\nIncredibly, the war went on. When the tanks ran out of gas, and the\nflame throwers became useless, and even the prosaic artillery pieces had\nno more rounds to fire, there were still simple guns and even simpler\nbayonets and swords.\n\nThe proud armies, the descendents of the Alexanders and Caesars and\nTemujins and Wellingtons and Grants and Rommels, relived their evolution\nin reverse.\n\nThe war went on. Slowly, inevitably, the armies split apart into smaller\nand smaller units, until the tortured countryside that so recently had\nfelt the impact of nuclear war once again knew the tread of bands of\narmed marauders. The tiny savage groups, stranded in alien lands, far\nfrom the homes and families that they knew to be destroyed, carried on a\nmockery of war, lived off the land, fought their own countrymen if the\noccasion suited, and revived the ancient terror of hand-wielded,\npersonal, one-head-at-a-time killing.\n\nThe CIA man watched the world disintegrate. Death was an individual\nbusiness now, and none the better for no longer being mass-produced. In\nagonized fascination he saw the myriad ways in which a man might die.\nMurder was only one of them. Radiation, disease, toxic gases that\nlingered and drifted on the once-innocent winds, and--finally--the most\nefficient destroyer of them all: starvation.\n\nThree billion people (give or take a meaningless hundred million) lived\non the planet Earth when the war began. Now, with the tenuous thread of\ncivilization burned away, most of those who were not killed by the\nfighting itself succumbed inexorably to starvation.\n\nNot everyone died, of course. Life went on. Some were lucky.\n\nA long darkness settled on the world. Life went on for a few, a pitiful\nfew, a bitter, hateful, suspicious, savage few. Cities became pestholes.\nBooks became fuel. Knowledge died. Civilization was completely gone from\nthe planet Earth.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe helmet was lifted slowly off his head. The CIA man found that he was\ntoo weak to raise his arms and help. He was shivering and damp with\nperspiration.\n\n\"Now you see,\" Ford said quietly, \"why the military men cracked up when\nthey used the computer.\"\n\nGeneral LeRoy, even, was pale. \"How can a man with any conscience at all\ndirect a military operation when he knows that _that_ will be the\nconsequence?\"\n\nThe CIA man struck up a cigarette and pulled hard on it. He exhaled\nsharply. \"Are all the war games ... like that? Every plan?\"\n\n\"Some are worse,\" Ford said. \"We picked an average one for you. Even\nsome of the 'brushfire' games get out of hand and end up like that.\"\n\n\"So ... what do you intend to do? Why did you call me in? What can _I_\ndo?\"\n\n\"You're with CIA,\" the general said. \"Don't you handle espionage?\"\n\n\"Yes, but what's that got to do with it?\"\n\nThe general looked at him. \"It seems to me that the next logical step is\nto make damned certain that _They_ get the plans to this computer ...\nand fast!\"\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Analog Science Fact & Fiction_ May\n    1962.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
