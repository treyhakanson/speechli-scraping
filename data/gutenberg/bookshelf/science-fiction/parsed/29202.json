Danny O'Rourke had reached that conclusion some\ntime before--a conclusion, however, that he was most careful to keep\nunexpressed.\n\nAnd then Danny not only thought it; he knew the Director was a fool;\nand the amazing incident that proved it took place in Stobolsk, the\nGovernmental Headquarters of District Three. Although Danny's regular\nstation was on a lonely peak in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in the\nUnited States, the occurrence was nevertheless observed by him; and\nthis happened for two reasons.\n\nThe New Soviet Government that took over control of all the Russias in\n1943 wanted, among other things, to install the most modern\nfire-fighting system, the equal of anything in the world. They turned,\nquite naturally, to the United States of America for their\ninstruction; and this was reason number one why Danny O'Rourke, pilot\nof the Air Fire Force, was where he was on the morning of June 13th.\n\nThe second reason was the tremendous timber wealth in the Ural\nDivision and the threat to destroy it by fire.\n\nPerhaps there might be mentioned a third reason: that this same Danny\nO'Rourke, red-haired, smiling, and debonair was listed on the Air Fire\nForce of the United States with the highest rating that the A. F. F.\nhas to give its pilots. But Danny would have grinned at such a\nsuggestion and would have countered with a denial that he was better\nqualified than \"the rest of the boys.\"\n\nBut Danny was there; he had been talking at length with the Director\nGeneral on the technical differences of the hot and cold nitrogen\nblasts for controlling fires on a wide front when suddenly the big man\nwas brought in.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe great figure stooped almost double to enter the room, and Danny\nran a hand through his shock of red hair and stared open-mouthed at\nthe giant when he straightened again and towered above the guard of\nRed soldiers who had brought him into the high-ceiled room.\n\nHe was clothed in a single garment of glinting blue that wrapped him\nabout and fell in heavy folds to the floor. Danny felt the resemblance\nto the shimmering blue of steel that has passed through fire, and his\neyes held to that garment in fascination until his gaze went on and up\nto the face.\n\nThe man's face was red, as if the flesh had been burned; here was one\nman Danny could not classify. He had met the people of many lands but\nnever had he seen one like this.\n\nIn one quick staring glance, Danny caught a picture of heavy jaws--a\nflashing of yellow teeth when the mouth opened to emit guttural,\nunrecognizable words--nostrils that ran crosswise of the face in a\nnose broad and flat! The forehead above was low and sloping. From the\nstraggling yellow hair it slanted down to brows that overhung\ndeep-sunk and cavernous eyes.... And when Danny O'Rourke's own curious\neyes met those of the stranger, they were held in a grip that was\nalmost hypnotic.\n\n\"Like a dirty, crawlin' snake's!\" he was telling himself over and\nover. \"Heaven help us if that boy ever gets rough. Who he is or what\nhe is, I don't know, but if I was the Director, I'd treat him nice\ntill I found out.\"\n\nDanny and the Director were standing side by side. The giant figure\nfixed a cold stare on Danny and barked short sentences that seemed to\nthe listener to be an explanation.\n\nBut Danny motioned helplessly to the official at his side. \"Maybe you\ncan savvy that,\" he suggested; \"it's new talk to me.\"\n\nThe newcomer repeated the guttural sounds. Upon the Director's face\nwas a frown of suspicion and puzzled wonder; the Director General did\nnot like to encounter either happenings or persons he could not\nreadily understand; it was disturbing to one's official dignity. The\ngiant must have read some of this, for he tried to make himself clear.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe repeated the sentences slowly. Then he waved one huge hand in air\nand pointed upward, and the hand moved up and up as if to indicate\nsome tremendous distance. He pointed to himself; then brought one\naiming finger down as if he were coming from that far-off place. And\nDanny got the significance.\n\n\"It's happened!\" he told the Director explosively. \"I knew it would\ncome some day--I knew they'd get here! And us monkeyin' with our\nstratosphere ships and thinkin' we were beatin' the rest of the\nUniverse!\"\n\nThe Director regarded the young American with about the same degree of\ndisfavor as he had shown the giant. \"What is it you say?\" he\nquestioned. \"You mean--what? I do not understand.\"\n\nAnd, in careful words, Danny explained. He told the Director of\nDistrict Three something of his dreams that space might not be an\ninsurmountable bar; he told him, with enthusiasm driving his words out\nfaster and faster, that here was a man--or if not a man, a living\ncreature of some sort--that had come out of space.\n\n\"Where did they find him?\" he demanded. \"Where is his ship?\"\n\nBut he ceased to ask questions as he noticed the Director's mirth. For\nthat official was rocking with roaring laughter that had a distinctly\nuncomplimentary sound. And he added some words in Russian that were as\nincomprehensible to Danny as the growling talk of the giant man, but\nthe O'Rourke temper flamed as he saw the other Russians in the room\nsmiling appreciatively.\n\nThen: \"Take him away!\" the Director thundered. \"We'll see where he\ncomes from. Search him! And if he hasn't any passports--\" The unended\nsentence was suggestive.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut an hour later, Danny saw the giant furnish his own ending to the\nincompleted order. He had left the Director's room. Across the street\nwas the gray stone building where prisoners were held for disposition\nby the courts. And once more Danny O'Rourke's jaw dropped in\nopen-mouthed, unbelieving amazement as he saw a section of gray stone\nwall fall outward where the edge of it was sharply outlined in\nwhite-hot, dripping stone.\n\nA great figure stepped forth. In his hand was a rod like an elongated\npencil attached to a heavy butt. And though nothing visible came from\nthe rod, Danny saw it pointed back at the building where iron bars\nsoftened till they sent rivulets of molten steel splashing upon the\npavement.\n\nA squad of soldiers in the blood-red color of their service stood\nnearby. One gave an order, and a dozen rifles were swung toward their\nshoulders. But the rifles never came to rest.\n\nDanny saw the quick swing of the slender rod. And he saw the men's\nmouths opened in screams that were never uttered. For, quicker than\nnerves could send their message to human brain and muscles, some\nunseen force had slashed their bodies in two as if a fiery sword had\nbeen swung by invisible hands.\n\nThe pointing rod lingered upon the huddled bodies for an instant,\nwhile that which had been human flesh vanished in a bursting cloud of\nsmoke; while the stones beneath turned to a seething pool of molten\nrock.... Then the rod moved slowly toward the frozen figure of Danny\nO'Rourke.\n\nDid the strange being sense that Danny had not been disbelieving like\nthe rest? Danny could never know. He knew only that he stood rigid\nwith horror, entirely unable to move, while that rod swung upon him;\nhe knew that the hand that held it released something that clicked,\nwherefore his life had been spared; and he knew that the savage face\nabove wrinkled into something resembling a snarling, triumphant smile,\nas the rod was returned to its hiding place under the garment of\nshimmering blue, and the mysterious figure turned and strode savagely\ndown the Avenue Stalin in the city of Stobolsk.\n\nDanny O'Rourke was to carry that picture clearly in his mind--the\nfigure that moved unhurriedly on, towering above the others, men and\nwomen, who scurried fearfully from his path. But he was to retain yet\nmore vividly the recollection of a group of red-clad bodies that were\nsevered at their waists as a slim tube swung--then a bursting cloud of\noily smoke, and a pool of molten rock where they had been.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSomething of this, perhaps, was clouding the eyes of Danny O'Rourke,\nPilot of the A.F.F. a month and more later, as he sat at lookout duty\nin a gleaming white tower on a high peak of the Sierras. Not that the\njob of lookout was part of O'Rourke's duty, now that he was back in\nthe U. S. A., but a cylinder of scarlet rested on a great rack at the\nbase of the tower, and Danny had no wish to hear the roar of that\ncylinder's stern exhaust for a time.\n\nEven the novelty of flying the newest rocket-ship in the service had\nworn off. Besides, he had patrolled his route, and he told himself\nthat the \"Infant\" needed a rest.\n\nThe \"Infant,\" better known on the records of the A. F. F. as Morgan,\nDavid E., Lookout, Station 39-G, was sleeping soundly on the elevating\ntable where a map of the district was mounted under glass. His\ncherubic face was pink and white, more suggestive of the age of three\nthan of twenty-three. And O'Rourke, glancing at him protectingly, hung\nup a paper to keep the sunlight from striking the young man's face.\n\nThe Infant had been Danny's special charge from the day he entered the\nservice, and now, except for the Chief and some other officials, only\nDanny knew that the Infant was there to teach and not to learn. For\nbehind those eyes that might have been taken from one of Rafael's\ncherubim lay a brain that Danny had learned to respect.\n\n\"Fifteen minutes more. I'm givin' you,\" he said inaudibly; \"then I'll\nbe on my way, and you'll do your own squintin' and peekin'.\" But the\nInfant's fifteen minutes were cut to that many seconds--\n\nDanny had been looking toward the south before he had turned to gaze\nat the Infant: his eyes came back to the same point to take up their\nreconnaissance. But now, where clear sky had made a blue back-drop for\nrugged peaks, was a line of black. And the line, while Danny watched\nin disbelief, moved like a smoky serpent: its head stretched out and\nout while from behind it there came the ominous line of black.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll this happened in a matter of seconds, and the moving head ceased\nat last to move; the line no longer grew. But, where it had been at\nfirst a thin mark of black, it changed now to billowing gray.\n\nIt was fifty miles away at least; but it showed clear and sharp. And\nthe first gray had hardly bloomed from its black beginning before the\nlong arm of Danny O'Rourke had swept the sleeping Infant to the floor,\nwhile, with the other hand, he swung an instrument of telescopic\nsights upon distant smoke.\n\nHe set it in careful focus--took a reading for distance--another for\ndirection--and while he was doing it he was vaguely conscious of one\nsingle sharp flash in the sky above that far-off cloud. In his\nrange-finder it showed once, like a glittering star; then it vanished,\nbut the trained eye of O'Rourke observed its passage like a ray of\nlight overhead.\n\nThe pink-faced youngster on the floor was still protesting sleepily\nwhen O'Rourke slammed down a switch and heard a voice answer promptly\nfrom an instrument on the wall. Danny shouted out his bearings on the\nfire:\n\n\"Thirty-nine-G! O'Rourke speaking for Morgan. Reporting fire on a wide\nfront--bearing Two-O-Seven to Two-Four-Nine! And for God's sake,\nChief, get a line on this quick. The whole thing shot up in a\nsecond--fifty miles of fire!\"\n\nAnother voice broke in excitedly. \"Station\nFourteen-Fourteen-Fourteen!\" The voice was stammering in evident\nconfusion. \"The whole earth has exploded--it's on fire now! I--I--\"\n\nThe Chief's voice broke in with a quiet, \"Bearing, please! Report your\nbearing, Fourteen!\"\n\nAnd the stammering voice steadied to give a figure.\n\n\"Headquarters speaking,\" said the quiet voice. \"Orders for O'Rourke.\nFor the love of Pete, get on that fire, Danny. Every instrument in the\noffice is chattering. Every patrol ship has spotted that blaze. You\ncan't all be crazy. It's in Section Eight--never mind the exact\nbearings--you'll find it without any trouble I imagine. Now beat it!\nAnd let me know what kind of a fire this is that starts on a\nfifty-mile front! You're in charge till I come.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTen seconds later, had the Infant been watching, which he had not--for\nhis eyes were all on the distant smoke--he would have seen the\nbeautiful curving sweep of a scarlet projectile, whose screaming\npropeller swept her off and up; he would then have seen it lie back\nflat as the great stern exhaust made a rocket of the ship to send it\nroaring into the heights.\n\nAnd in the air-tight cabin of the newest fire-fighting machine of the\nA. F. F., Danny O'Rourke pulled his body out of the slumped position\ninto which his quick acceleration had forced him; then set his ship on\nher course to where a distant smoke made puffballs of gray against a\ncloudless sky. And, like his Chief, he was wondering with a wonderment\nthat bordered upon disbelief what manner of fire this was that shot\nlike a fifty-mile serpent across mountains and valleys.\n\nHe was over it in less than ten minutes, flying high to clear the tiny\ndots slipping swiftly across his view-finder. They were other\nfirecraft; he saw them darting in and down from all sides. For\nhimself, he took the line of smoke at its western end where it had\nbegun. Here it would be at its worst, perhaps, although no reports\nwere in as yet.\n\nThe radio had been bringing in messages unceasingly as patrols and\nfirecraft answered the call. Some nearer than himself were reporting\nthemselves \"on the fire\"; he saw them grouped in the usual echelon\nformation up to windward of the blaze. They darted down and in as he\nlooked, and Danny thrilled at the sight which had never yet failed to\nreach the core of his emotional Irish nature.\n\nThe smoke and fire swallowed them up; their red bodies and short black\nwings drove unswervingly into the holocaust of flame.\n\n\"Like a bunch o' bats out o' hell!\" said Danny admiringly. \"And 'tis\nhell they're goin' into!\" Which fact there was none to dispute with\nDanny O'Rourke who knew, if any man did, the full truth of the remark.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe saw them as they struck the fire; saw the whirling blast of snow\nthat drove under them as they went into the fight with the wildest\nenemy of man; and he knew that a smothering blanket of carbon dioxide\nwas driving with hurricane force upon the flames.\n\nOn the instrument at his side flashed the \"Ascend!\" order of the\nsquadron commander, and an instant later the flight reappeared a half\nmile away.\n\nThe commander must have sighted O'Rourke's ship. \"Shall we repeat over\nsame course?\" the instrument spelled out, while Danny, circling above,\nwatched the effects of the drive.\n\nIt had checked the flames, that first blast of the CO_2 squadron; he\nsaw blackened, jagged trees where a roaring furnace had been. But the\nflames were building up again. \"Repeat!\" O'Rourke answered; then\nwatched them drive in again.\n\nFrom a wooded valley beyond a low range came a call for help. A lone\nship in the red and black of the service had driven down into that\nvalley that was like a cauldron of seething flame.\n\n\"I can't touch it!\" a thin voice said. \"The up-draft kills my blast.\"\n\nDanny O'Rourke was sending out another call. The answer came from\npowerful sending instruments.\n\n\"Nitro squadron Hundred and One, on the fire!\" it said, and gave a\nposition in quick figures. Danny's own voice transmitter was on. He\nsnapped out the position of the lone fighter. \"Get in there!\" he\nordered; \"Show your stuff! No--wait! Follow me; I'll lead you in!\"\n\nAnd to himself he added: \"Now we'll see what pure nitrogen will do in\na real scrap.\"\n\nHe closed a switch, and from a compartment at his back a low whine\nrose and grew to a scream. It was echoed in a shriek more shrill from\nthe bow where a port had opened to take in the air. And Danny knew\nthat that air, of which eighty percent was nitrogen, was being rid of\nits oxygen in the retort at his back, and the nitrogen alone was\npouring out beneath him in a tremendous and ceaseless blast.\n\nThe squadron had appeared--a row of dots that came in on a long\nslanting drive from the ten thousand level. They swung into faultless\nformation to \"ride his tail\" into whatever flaming breath he might\nlead. And Danny O'Rourke threw his red ship down and into the valley\nthat seethed with a brew from the Pit itself.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere had been pines in that valley, and firs towering hundreds of\nfeet in the air. They were living torches now, half seen through a\nwhirling chaos of flame. It billowed as if the very gases that burned\nwere tortured in the burning. The black-red of smoke-choked flames\nparted at times to show a deadlier white light below--a white, glaring\nheat in the heart of this gigantic, furnace--a scintillant, quivering\nhorror on which Danny fixed the cross hairs of his sights as he rode\nhis screaming meteor down into the pit.\n\n\"Bats out o' hell!\" And now the brood was returning, it must have\nseemed. But beneath them, as they passed, that vivid whiteness went\ndead. Yet before it changed Danny saw unbelievable things--pools of\nmolten rock, glaring white through the smoke.\n\nUp and out at the end of the valley! And Danny gasped for breath even\nin the shelter of his cabin's insulated walls. And, used as he was to\nthe red menace that they fought, he went sick at sight of a message\nthat spelled itself beside his controls.\n\n\"Ship number six down. Failed to come out.\" It was signed with the\nname of the squadron commander who had followed where he led.\n\nAnd the valley! For five miles they had laid a blanket of\nnon-combustible gases. For five minutes, perhaps, their course could\nbe seen. And at the end of that time it was as it had been before, and\nthe flames raged on unchecked.\n\nHis own Chief's number flashed before him; then a message that clicked\nacross his scanning plate:\n\n\"O'Rourke! Get out of that hole! Nitrogen won't touch it; we can't\npour in enough. It's the same all along the line. We'll have to break\nit up--smother it one part at a time. Have you tried your sound\ndampener?\"\n\nAnd Danny O'Rourke had the grace to blush even through the flush that\nthe fire's breath had given his face. \"Forgot it!\" he shouted into his\nvoice sender. \"Forgot the ship had the little doodad on it!\"\n\nThe Chief responded audibly. \"You didn't forget to go first into that\ndoorway to hell,\" he said drily. \"You fool Irishman, go back down and\ntry the thing; give the 'little doodad' a chance!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOnce more the red ship fell swiftly under Danny's hand. As before, the\nvalley yawned like the living threat of a volcano in eruption. But\nthis time, instead of the whining nitro-producers, there came from\nbeneath the ship a discordant shriek like nothing that the quiet\nmountains had ever heard. And Danny's fingers played over a strange\nkeyboard whose three keys were rheostats, and the crashing discord\nbelow rose to a horror of sound that tore and battered at the ship's\nthick walls to set the nerves of the crouching man a-jangle. But his\neyes, watching through a lookout below, saw strange disturbances of\nthe flames; he saw the masses of flame shiver as if stricken--fall\napart--vanish!\n\nAnd he held the sound controls at that same horrendous shriek while\nhis ship swept on and the thunder of her passing was lost in the\npandemonium that went before. But the valley, when the red ship had\npassed, was a place of charred skeleton trees--of gray, swirling\nashes, and of embers, here and there, that blew back to life only to\nbe smothered by the gases of the ships that followed in his wake.\n\nAnd the voice that spoke from the instrument beside him still spoke\ndrily. \"There's fifty miles more of that ahead,\" said the voice. \"Just\nkeep moving along; we'll mop up behind you.... Oh, and by the way,\nO'Rourke, give my congratulations to the Infant on the success of his\ninvention. His sound-dampener is some little doodad; we'll be needing\nmore of them, I should say.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was an hour or more later at the Headquarters of the Mountain\nDivision that the Chief amplified that remark in a way he himself\ncould not have foreseen. He had been talking to Danny, and now on the\nwall of an adjoining room, where men sat at strange instruments, a red\nlight flashed.\n\n\"We still don't know what started it all,\" the Chief was saying. \"But\nit made a fine tryout for Morgan's invention. If I thought you and he\ncould do it, I would believe you had started that fire yourselves for\na\"--his voice rose abruptly to a shout--\"Man! There's the red on the\nboard--a general alarm!\"\n\n\"Throw the big switch!\" he roared. \"Cut us in, quick! Cut us in!\"\n\nDanny O'Rourke, under any ordinary circumstances would have been\nhugely amused at the extraordinary sight of the Chief of the Mountain\nDivision in a ferment of excitement that was near hysteria. But the\nflashing of the red that swept like a finger of flame across every\nstation number of the big board did not mean that ordinary matters\nwere at hand. A voice was speaking; its high-pitched shrillness showed\nthat the excitement of the moment was not confined to the office of\nthe Mountain Division alone.\n\n\"A. F. F. Headquarters, Washington,\" it shrilled. \"General Alarm.\nChicago destroyed by fire. Flames sweeping in well defined paths\nacross the country. Originated in Mountain Division. Cause\nundetermined. Three lines of fire reported; coming east\nfast--unbelievable speed.... There! Cleveland has got it; reports a\npath of fire has cut across city melting steel and even stone.... Now\nBuffalo!... God knows what it is.\" The voice broke with excitement for\nan instant; Danny could almost see the distant man fighting for\ncontrol of himself as a maze of instruments about him wrote incredible\nthings.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Orders!\" said the voice now. \"All A. F. F. ships report to your\nDivision Headquarters. Division officers keep in communication with\nWashington. Mountain Division send all equipment east. Flying orders\nwill be given you en route. The country--the whole world--is in\nflames!\"\n\nBeside him, Danny O'Rourke heard the voice of his Chief.\n\"Unbelievable--impossible--preposterous!\" His voice like that other\nwas growing shrill. \"The country--world--in flames!\"\n\nBut he found voice to snap out a command to a waiting officer in the\ndoorway of the adjoining room. \"Repeat general order. Send all craft\neast!\"\n\nTo Danny he whispered. \"Your 'little doodad'--I wish to heaven we had\na thousand of them now! But what does it mean? Lanes of fire across\nthe country--whole cities destroyed! What devil's work is this?...\nThere's nobody who knows.\"\n\nBut Danny was staring as if he saw through the high, instrument-covered\nwalls. Back to a valley of flame that was like a doorway to hell, where\nrocks, gray with the frosty years, had been melted to pools ... back to\na glinting light where something swift and scintillant had flashed once\nin a cloudless sky ... back--far back ... back to a street in a town\nhalf across the world, and a figure of a giant who strode away with a\nsmile of triumph on his ill-formed face ... but first that giant had\nmelted his way through walls of stone; and, like the stone, steel bars\nand human flesh were as nothing before the invisible heat that come from\na slender rod!\n\nHis own voice, when he moved his dry tongue to speak, came huskily; it\nwas as if another person were speaking far off:\n\n\"I think you're wrong ... yes, I thing you're wrong, Chief. There's\none man who knows and 'tis myself is that one.... One man--and the\nother is a beast like no livin' man on the face of the earth! _He_\nknows--he and the devils he's brought with him!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was an unsatisfactory interview that Danny had with the Chief.\n\"You're crazy!\" was the verdict of that A. F. F. official when Danny\nhad finished. \"You're crazy, or else--or else--\" His voice trailed\noff; his eyes were on the moving letters that flashed their message of\ndisaster in an ever changing procession across the scanning screen on\nthe wall.\n\n\"... outbreaks have ceased ... tremendous destruction ... no rational\nexplanation ... meteors, perhaps ... thousands of lives ... no\nestimate....\"\n\nThere seemed no end to the tale of disaster, and the Chief's voice\ndied away into silence. If Danny was right he had no words to fit the\nunbelievable truth.\n\n\"Get into your new ship,\" the Chief ordered brusquely, \"and take the\nInfant with you. I'll send a relief man to his station. Go east--lay\nyour course for Washington; you'll get other orders on the way!\"\n\nAnd a half hour later the first rocket ship of the A. F. F. was\nblasting its way through the thin gases of the stratosphere eastward\nbound. But by now Danny O'Rourke had a more sympathetic listener than\nbefore.\n\n\"In big puddles it was, and lakes! 'Twas still melted, some of it, in\nthat valley.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" asked the Infant casually. \"Radiant heat moves with the\nspeed of light. We wouldn't think anything of focusing ten million\ncandle power of light energy into a spot like that. Why not heat? Just\nbecause we haven't learned to generate it--focus it--shoot it out in a\nstream like water from a hose--there's no use in denying that someone\nelse has beat us to the punch.\"\n\nThe Infant's calm blue eyes were upon the luminous plates of the\nship's microscope where the swift moving terrain beneath them was\npictured clearly. The mountains were behind them now; endless miles of\nripening grain made the land a sea of yellow and brown and, across\nthat ocean, like the lines of foam that mark the wake of ships, lay\nthree straight lines of black.\n\n\"Meteors!\" sneered the Infant. \"Yet if you'd tell your story to some\nof these wise men they would die of laughing--and maybe that wouldn't\nbe a bad idea, either; they will be dying in a way that's a damned\nsight more unpleasant unless someone finds how to catch these birds.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAhead of them the lookouts framed blue emptiness. Below, on direct\nsight, was but the vaguest blur that meant earth and clouds far\nbeneath. Only the magnification of the microscope brought out the\ndetails, and on its screen the unrolling picture showed those three\nlines broadening and merging to widespread desolation; then the smoke\nclouds came between to shut off a world reeking with the fumes of\ndestruction. An occasional flash of red wings showed where the units\nof the A. F. F. were at work.\n\nThey beheld a city, below them--and smoking ruins where three great\ngashes had been torn with torches of flame. To Danny there came a\nthought that was sickening: it was as if some great three-toed beast\nhad drawn one paw, red with the blood of helpless humans, ripping\nacross the bosom of the land.\n\nHis number was flashing on the call board that had been registering\nincessant orders to other craft. He cut in on the Headquarters wave.\n\n\"O'Rourke--Mountain Division--Unit Five!\" he reported. \"Do you get my\nvoice or shall I send by key?\"\n\nThe man at Headquarters did not trouble to reply to the question. His\nvoice came faint but clear:\n\n\"Number Five--O'Rourke--Orders! If that new ship of yours has any\nspeed, show it now! Bear on Washington! Get here as quick as the good\nLord will let you! Mountain Division says you've got something good in\nthat sound-dampener; if you have, we need it now!\"\n\nO'Rourke shot back a crisp acknowledgment; took a reading from two\nradio beacons; projected them on the map; and pricked a point at their\nintersection. He had his own ship on a line with the Capitol in a\nmatter of seconds.\n\n\"And there's hell poppin' there, I'm bettin'! That Headquarters lad\ndidn't tell much--he wouldn't be worth a dime on a newscast--but I\ngathered there was somethin' doin'.\"\n\nHe had spoken more to himself than to his companion who had been a\nsilent listener to the incoming orders. But the Infant replied in his\nown peculiar way.\n\n\"The one you saw,\" he said inquiringly: \"he did his dirty work with a\nlittle rod or tube, you said?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith an effort, O'Rourke brought his thoughts in line with the\nquestion. \"Oh, you mean the man-thing I saw in Stobolsk? Yes, that's\nright; he had a thing like a gun.\"\n\n\"And he held it in his hand?\"\n\n\"In the big paw that passed for a hand, yes!\"\n\n\"All right! Now think carefully, Danny, and tell me: was there\nanything fastened to it--a wire, perhaps--a connection of some kind\nwith the ground?\"\n\nO'Rourke stared at the pink and white face of the cherub who sat with\nhim in the control room of a rocket-ship that threw itself like a red\nmeteor across the high skies. \"You're a bit of a devil, yourself,\" he\nsaid wonderingly at last. \"How in the names of the Saints did you\nknow? Yes, there was a wire, and I had forgotten it myself. It hung\ndown, I remember, from the butt of the thing. But not to the ground.\nInfant--you missed it there; 'twas looped back like into the folds of\nthe damn blue nightie he wore.\"\n\n\"And then went to the ground,\" said the Infant imperturbably,\n\"--through his shoes most likely; or, if the robe was metal, that may\nhave dragged on the ground instead.\"\n\nHe smiled seraphically at the bewildered pilot as he added: \"That's\nall, Danny, for the present. Fly your little tin ship. I've got some\nheavy thinking to do.\"\n\nDanny heard him ask one cryptic question, but he asked it as one who\nknows that only from his own brain can come the answer.\n\n\"How do they get rid of it?\" the Infant was demanding. \"If they stay\nin the air, how do they get rid of the load?\"\n\nAnd Pilot O'Rourke was glad enough to leave the answer to that one to\nthe Infant. For had not the Infant alone seen the only reasonable\nanswer to the puzzle of the mysterious man? And Danny had learned that\nit takes a real man and a real mind to track truth to her hiding place\nand accept the absurd improbabilities on which truth rests.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey were approaching their destination when the Infant opened his\nCupid's-bow mouth to pronounce one additional question. \"How high,\" he\nasked, \"will your little tin ship fly? I know they've reached just\nunder a hundred thousand experimentally, but how high will this one\ngo?\"\n\n\"And that's a question neither you nor I can answer, Infant.\" Danny\nwas working with careful fingers at tiny levers; their control room\nwas filled with whining whispers and thin shrieks. \"We're goin' down\nnow,\" he continued, and again flipped over the switch that would put\nhim in communication with the Washington office of the A. F. F.\n\n\"O'Rourke--Mountain Division--Unit Five,\" he said quietly.\n\"Approaching Washington at altitude sixty-five thousand. Descending.\nOrders, please!\"\n\nWithin the control room, where the voice of a Washington operator should\nhave answered on the instant, there was silence. The rocket motor had\nbeen stilled. The two men were suddenly breathless with\nlistening--listening!--where was heard only the whispering shrillness\nfrom without. The whispering grew as the red ship slanted down into\ndenser air; it built up in volume; it varied its pitch and timber till\nit sounded like echoing voices ... ghostly voices and phantom words ...\nlike orders from the dead....\n\nAnd Danny O'Rourke found his eyes staring into those of the Infant,\nwhere he read only the confirmation of his own fears.\n\nIt was the Infant who first found words with which to break the\ndreadful silence.\n\n\"Headquarters is gone,\" he said in a strange, dry voice, \"wiped out!\nThey must have got it! It looks as if we were on our own.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" he asked. \"It's your ship.\"\n\nAnd Danny answered with a single word, though he added other for\nemphasis under his breath:\n\n\"Down!\" he said quietly. \"And be damned to them!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRolling smoke clouds came to meet them. Danny O'Rourke was watching\nhis altimeter sharply as he neared the ground. But he glanced more\nthan once at the smoke. It was shot through with tongues of flame as\nthey settled down; that was only what might be expected. But Danny was\npuzzled by the gray-white whirls that rose through the billowing\nsmoke, until he knew it for the dust of powdered masonry, and realized\nthat below him, where great buildings had been, were tumbled ruins.\n\nBeside his control board a radio warning was telling of approaching\nships. Danny cut in on then on emergency wave-length, and found that\ntwo full squadrons of nitro-ships were at hand with others coming.\n\n\"Let them tend to it!\" the pale-faced youngster beside him choked--one\ndoes not see his country's capital destroyed without a tightening of\nthe throat. \"They can cool it with CO_2 and put down a rescue squad,\nthough what they can do in that furnace is more than I can see.\"\n\nDanny nodded mutely; he opened the exhaust to the full, and the\nrocket-plane swept out on whirlwinds of raging fire, and smoke, whose\nflames reached up even where they flew and licked hungrily at their\nship.\n\nJarring explosions sent shudders through their craft. Ahead of them\nbright flashes illumined the swirling fumes where bursting shells\nmarked the destruction of some ammunition stores outside the city.\n\nAnd Danny, as he drove his red meteor into the clear air of the upper\nlevels, was searching the heavens above for the enemy he had expected\nto sight down below. He knew now that his mad plunge into the seething\nflames was only a blind impulse--an effort to satisfy that demand\nwithin him for a foe upon whom to wreak revenge.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBeside him, his companion spun the dial of a receiving set for the\nAirnews Service; a voice was shouting excitedly into their cabin:\n\"... physicists unable to find cause ... no meteoric material seen ...\nnew rays ... enormous temperatures ... some new and unknown conditions\nencountered in space--\"\n\n\"Hell!\" said the Infant wearily, and snapped off the instrument.\n\"Meteors! New conditions in space! But, come to think of it, we can't\nblame them for being off the trail. You know that the bird that's\ndoing this flies high and fast ... and when he stops there's nobody\nleft alive to tell of it!... And don't look for him here.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" Danny demanded aggressively. \"This ship isn't armed, but if\nI get my sights on that flyin' devil--\"\n\n\"You won't,\" said the Infant darkly. \"He's off somewhere discharging\nthe load he's accumulated.\"\n\nHe reached for a map, stuck his finger on a point in eastern New York\nState. \"Let's go there, Danny--and I'd like to get there _right now_!\"\n\nAnd Danny O'Rourke, who, ordinarily was a bit particular about who\ngave him orders, looked at the Infant's blue eyes that had gone hard\nand cold, and he swung his roaring ship toward the north and a place\nthat was marked by a steady finger on the map.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNew York was a place of flashing reflections far beneath them as they\npassed. Danny pointed downward toward the miniature city, where a\nsilvery river met the sea; where a maze of flaming lights in all of\nthe colors of the spectrum gave indication of activity at the great\nNavy Field.\n\n\"How did he miss it, the murderin' devil?\" he asked. \"How come that he\nhit Washington first? Did he have some way of knowin' that it was the\nheart of the whole country?\"\n\n\"And why pick on us here in this country? Or are we just the first,\nand will he spit his rage over the rest of the world before he's\nthrough? It it the end of the world that's come?\"\n\nTo all of which there was no answer. And at last, when New York had\nvanished, they came to a smaller city and a broad expanse of roof that\ntook their wheels.\n\nDanny followed where his companion led into great buildings and a\nplace of offices where excited officials stood in knots about\nnews-casting cones; then they were in a quiet room, in the presence of\na lean-bodied man whose hawklike face turned flinty at some request\nthe Infant made.\n\n\"What the lad wants, I don't know,\" said Danny to himself, \"but\nwhatever it is he won't be gettin' it from old Gimlet-eyes.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut he saw the Infant write something on a card and he heard him say,\nas he handed it to the official: \"Send that to the President--_at\nonce_!\" And though the words were hardly audible they had a quality\nthat brought an instant response; while the written words brought a\nportly man who shook the Infant's hand fervently and inquired what\nservice a great electric company could render.\n\nDanny heard Gimlet-eyes protesting; heard broken bits of sentences:\n\"... the great Sorenson tube ... he knows of our disintegrator ...\ninsists upon our furnishing ... preposterous....\"\n\nThe portly man cut him short. \"You will give Mr. Morgan whatever he\nwishes,\" he ordered crisply. Then Danny saw him clutch at a desk for\nsupport as still another man appeared at the open door to shout:\n\n\"New York! My God! New York's gone! Burning! The Empire State Building\nmelted! Crashed!... The whole city is being destroyed!\"\n\nAnd in the moment of numbness that seized Danny O'Rourke he heard the\nInfant say: \"How soon can we have it? I want it in our ship--up\nabove--an hour? We'll be there.\" But Danny had no further interest in\nthe Infant's arrangements for obtaining some unknown equipment; he was\nplunging through the doorway and running at full speed toward the ramp\nwhere they had descended.\n\nHe knew dimly that the younger man had followed and was crowding into\nthe cabin after him. Danny, as he locked the port and lifted his red\nship off her guides, was fully conscious of only one fact: that a\nhundred miles south a city was being destroyed and that somewhere in\nthe vast heights above the city he would find the destroyer.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Hudson that had been a thread of silver was no longer bright as\nthey approached the city at its mouth; burnished now with its\nreflection of black smoke clouds and red tongues of flame, it vanished\nat last under a mountain of black that heaped itself in turbulent\npiles and whirling masses until the winds swept the smoke out over the\nsea.\n\nAnd high above it all--so high that all clouds were below it--there\nhung in a lucent sky one tiny, silvery speck. There was a delicate\nsteering sight on Danny's ship; he could direct the red craft as if it\nwere in very fact a projectile that could be controlled in flight. And\nunder the cross hairs of that sight swung a silvery speck, while the\nman who looked along the telescopic tube cursed steadily and\nmethodically as if in some way his hate might span the gap and reach\nthat distant foe.\n\nAnd then the speck vanished. Danny followed it with the powerful\nglasses of his sighting tube; he saw it swing inland--saw it move like\na line of silvery light, almost, swifter in its motion than his\ninstrument could follow. But even in that swift flight Danny's eyes\nobserved one fact: the enemy ship was coming down; it slanted in on\nthat long volplane that must have ripped the air apart like a bolt of\nlightning. And Danny's red rocket swept out and around in a long,\nlooping flight, while he laid the ship on the course that other had\nfollowed.\n\n\"That's one of them,\" he said savagely; \"there must be two more. But\nI'll get this one if I have to crash him in air and smash my own ship\nright through him.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe mind of Danny O'Rourke was filled with only one idea; he had\nsighted his prey--the ship in which sat a man-thing who had sent a\nterrible death to Danny's fellows. And, though his hands moved\ncarefully and methodically, though externally he was cool and\ncollected, within him was a seething maelstrom of hate. All he saw was\nthat giant figure as he had seen it before; all he knew was that he\nmust overtake that speeding ship and send it to earth.\n\nHe had even forgotten Morgan; perhaps he was never fully conscious of\nhis coming from the moment when that other trembling, shaken man had\nshouted: \"New York! New York's gone!\"\n\n\"There aren't two more,\" the Infant was saying from his seat at the\nrear of the cabin: \"there's just one. Those three lines were always\nparallel except when they widened out: that meant that he had gone up\nhigher. If we ever see that ship, we'll see three discharge tubes for\nthe ray.\"\n\nDanny O'Rourke turned his eyes that had gone haggard and deep-sunk\nwith the sights they had seen. He stared vacantly at the Infant.\n\n\"Didn't know,\" he said thickly, \"--didn't know you were here. I'll set\nyou down; I'll let you out before I ram him....\"\n\nFor reply, the other pointed ahead. The red ship had torn through a\nlayer of thick clouds; Danny was flying below them above a mountainous\nworld of bare hill-tops and wooded valleys. Directly ahead, hovering\nhigh over a mountain higher than its fellows, was the white craft of\nthe enemy; Danny, saw it in hard outline against the darker masses of\nclouds beyond. He saw that it was motionless, that a slender cable was\nsuspended for a thousand feet below, and that the end of the cable,\nhanging close above the mountain top, was split into a score of wires\nthat stood out in all directions, while, from each, poured a stream of\nblue fire.\n\nAnd once more all this that he saw was as nothing to the pilot; all\nthought, too, of his fellow victim went from his mind. He could see\nonly the white ship, doubly hideous because of its seeming purity;\nand, as before, he brought the cross hairs of directional sights upon\nit while he opened the rocket exhaust to the full.\n\nBut even pilot O'Rourke, with the highest rating in the A. F. F.,\ncould not follow the lightning-swift leap of the snow-white thing that\nburied itself in the smother of cloud banks above.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDanny set his red ship down on that same barren hilltop; he motioned\nMorgan to follow as he stepped out.\n\n\"We're somewhere in Pennsylvania,\" he announced. \"You're stayin' here.\nSorry to dump you out like this, but you'll find a way out. Get to a\nradio--call a plane.\" He held out his hand in unspoken farewell.\n\nBut the other man disregarded it. \"What's the idea?\" he inquired.\n\nDanny's reply came in short, breathless sentences. \"Going up to find\nthat ship. Ram it. No use of your getting smashed up, too. Good-by,\nInfant; you're a good old scout.\"\n\nDanny's mind was all on what lay ahead; he was wildly eager to be off\non the hunt. It took him an instant to comprehend the look from\nMorgan's steady, blue eyes.\n\n\"Listen!\" the younger man was ordering. \"You're not going to do that;\nI am! And not just that way, either.\"\n\n\"Did you see that cable and the electric discharges?\" he demanded\nexcitedly. \"It's just as I thought: he accumulates a negative charge;\nhe has to get rid of it--he's just like a thunder-cloud loaded with\nstatic--and the heat ray does it. I had it figured that way.\"\n\n\"Remember the little tube you saw before--that's why I asked about the\nwire. I knew he would have to ground it without its going through his\nbody.\"\n\nDanny O'Rourke was an intent listener now. When the Infant talked like\nthis he was a person to be listened to with respect, even if all he\nsaid was not understood.\n\n\"Now,\" said the Infant with finality, \"let's forget this idea of\nramming him. You couldn't hit him anyway; even a cruiser couldn't do\nit. If it could you would have radioed for a squadron an hour ago--you\nknow that.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe pilot nodded his acknowledgment. \"But, my God, man,\" he exploded,\n\"I've got to do something; I've got to try!\"\n\n\"We'll do it,\" was the confident reply, \"--or I will. Now we'll go\nback to the Consolidated Electric; they will have the Sorenson\ndisintegrator ready. I'll put it in your machine and--\"\n\n\"And what?\" broke in the pilot. \"Is this some new death ray? We've\nbeen hearing about them for years--just hearing about them. If that's\nwhat you mean, then your idea is all wet; it's worse than mine. I'm\ngoing up.\"\n\nPerhaps the younger man saw something of the wild impatience in\nDanny's deep-sunk eyes. He laid a restraining hand on the pilot's arm\nwhile he explained:\n\n\"No death ray, Danny--that will come later; we haven't got it now. But\nwe've got the disintegration of matter--the splitting of the atom, on\nsomething bigger than a laboratory scale. Sorenson did it. There is a\nflood of electrical energy poured out--streams of electrons--negative\nelectricity. It leaves a positive charge that is tremendous if it\nisn't neutralized.\n\n\"I said that devilish white thing was like a thunder-cloud; well, I'll\nmake your ship like the earth; then I'll bring them near each\nother--no need to ram him--and it will be like the hammer of Thor--\"\n\nThe Infant's words ended in a crackling roar from above. Danny\nO'Rourke found his whole body tingling as if he were filled with\nstinging sparks; each single fiber of each muscle was twitching.\n\nA blue light shone eerily overhead. He bent his stiffened, jerking\nneck till he could look--till he could see, with eyes that were filled\nwith flashing fires of their own, other ripping blue flashes from the\nends of outstanding wires, and above him a thousand feet, the belly of\na white ship.\n\nAnd through the brain-hammering clatter of the static discharge he\nheard the voice of the Infant, whose words came jerkily between the\nshudders that shook him:\n\n\"He doesn't dare, damn him! Can't let the wires touch us. Has\nto--discharge--in air.... But he'll burn us--afterwards!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Stand still!\" said Danny through stiffened lips. \"Don't make a move!\nHe hasn't seen us, it may be!\"\n\nThe crackling discharge had ceased; the rain of miniature lightning\nbolts that had shot around them and through them had ended. The cable\nhad gone up before their eyes and hidden itself in the white ship. The\npilot's eyes clung to that white-bellied thing, so slender and round\nand gleaming against the dark clouds overhead; he saw it hang\nmotionless for long minutes while it seemed that the breath in his\nthroat must choke him. Then he saw that white roundness enlarge as the\nship settled swiftly down.\n\nIt hung in another moment directly above their red ship. Danny saw\nthree round holes open in the white shell--the three outlets that the\nInfant had predicted. It had descended noiselessly, but now there came\nfrom within a high-pitched whining hum. The dreaded heat and ray! They\nwere about to see their own ship destroyed! And, as for themselves--!\nDanny was still waiting for the first, devastating blast of\nintolerable heat, when the ship settled softly down.\n\nGreen port-holes stared at him like eyes. A door was outlined with a\nline of black that spread to a round opening as a door swung wide. A\nhuge door in the side of a huge ship, but it was none too large for\nthe giant figure that crept through.\n\nAnd Danny O'Rourke stared wordlessly at the flat-nosed face above a\nrobe of chilled steel blue.\n\n\"'Tis him!\" he gasped out that the Infant might hear. \"The same\none--the devil I saw in Stobolsk!\" And if any other identification\nwere needed it came in the slender rod, whose heavy metal butt was\ngripped in the giant's hand. At sight of the wire looping back from\nthe weapon; at remembrance of the Infant's shrewd guess; and with the\nconviction that now this same weapon was to annihilate the only two\nmen who knew how to combat this destroyer, Danny threw back his head\nand laughed--until his harsh laughter died away in a snarl of rage.\n\n\"Go on and do it,\" he heard, \"you ugly devil. You killed those Reds;\nyou've killed thousands of us since, you murderin' beast! Go on and\nkill us, too!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe slender tube was aimed at him squarely. Danny waited to hear the\nfaint click that would mean his death as the invisible ray sawed into\nhis body. Instead the huge figure leaned down to stare at the pilot;\nthen straightened while a crooked smile of recognition appeared on the\ndeformed face.... And the slender rod moved on--on--in a slow circle\ntoward the other waiting man!\n\nIt clicked before it reached him. Danny heard it, and \"No--no!\" he\nscreamed in a horrible voice. \"Run, Infant! Beat it, for God's sake!\"\n\nThe enemy was twenty feet away; it seemed as many miles to Danny as he\nthrew himself at the foe. He did not see the ray strike. He heard only\nthe Infant's steady voice calling: \"Remember Danny--the Sorenson\nmachine--if you live.\"\n\nThen a blast of reflected heat swept upon him, and he felt himself\nstifling. There was a pool of molten rock, white and glaring with heat ...\nand a puff of smoke, grayish black, and ashes that whirled in the wind that\nswept up from the pool....\n\nDanny tried to raise himself from the hot stone where he had fallen,\nso near he was to the pool of death. He saw the grotesque figure of\nthe giant move over toward the red ship, look at it, sneer\ncontemptuously, and turn back to his own ship of doom. He saw the\nblack entrance swallow the huge foe and he saw the door close, while\nthe great ship, so innocently white in its sleek slender roundness,\nrose again in the air where the clouds took it up.\n\nAnd Danny, resting on scorched but unfeeling hands, stared after him\nuntil he got the enemy's direction of flight as he entered the clouds,\nthen he turned towards a place of glowing rock where the air rose in\nquivering waves.\n\n\"You said it, Infant,\" he whispered; \"you knew I was just a fightin'\nfool that wouldn't think the way you would. You told me to get the\nSorenson machine--\" He brushed at his suddenly blinded eyes with one\nseared hand, then turned to stare grimly and appraisingly where the\nwhite ship had gone.\n\n\"And I'm thinkin',\" he told the beastly occupant of that carrier of\ndeath, \"that you didn't shoot your damned ray quite quick enough. The\nInfant beat you to it! He got his message to me first!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHow he got to the flat-roofed landing zone of the Consolidated\nElectric, Danny, doubtless, could never have told. Nor was he aware of\nthe hand that set in the forward cabin of his ship a strange machine.\nBut he growled his instructions:\n\n\"Set it goin'! 'Tis the Infant's orders--I mean Mr. Morgan's. What the\ndevil it is I don't know, but 'Turn it on!' he told me--'Have them put\nit on full!'\" And, though a man whom Danny knew only as Gimlet-eyes\nstared at him curiously, he reached down to the apparatus, set a dial,\nclosed a switch here and there, then stepped back.\n\nBut Gimlet-eyes ventured one protest. \"You're not grounding it!\" he\nexclaimed, in a voice that was tinged with horror. \"You'll get an\naccumulation on your ship that will shoot off like lightning--millions\nof volts!\"\n\n\"How long would that be takin'?\" Danny inquired gruffly.\n\nAnd Gimlet-eyes replied, as one who washes his hands of all\nresponsibility in a rather horrible affair: \"An hour--not more than an\nhour!\"\n\n\"Then I'll just be drivin' around for an hour,\" said Danny, and\nslammed shut the door-port of the red ship.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe red rocket drove in slow circles that were a hundred miles across\nwhile that hour passed and the numbness of mind that had held Danny in\na stupor slipped away. For the first time he realized the emptiness of\nthe world that the Infant had left; he knew with a sharp stab of\nself-reproach how much had gone from his life in that instant when he\nsprang vainly toward the giant enemy.\n\nHe called himself wild names for his fancied sluggishness. Then that,\ntoo, passed, and at thought of the weapon the Infant had given him and\nof the work that lay ahead, his haggard face forgot the lines that\nhorror had drawn and relaxed into a tired smile that told of a mind\ncontent.\n\nGradually his looping whirls had carried him toward the east. Another\ncity was being devastated by the enemy; that Danny got from the\nnewscast. Only that and one other message broke the tedious eternity\nof that long hour.\n\nDanny's number flashed on the screen beside his controls.\nUnconsciously he answered, but he sat up alertly at sound of his\nChief's voice.\n\n\"I can't get anyone,\" the voice said. \"Headquarters is gone; I just\ncalled you on a chance. And I believe you now, Danny. That devil wiped\nout a whole fleet of our planes; melted the cruisers with one shot,\nand the scouts couldn't go fast enough to escape. Only one got\naway....\n\n\"But where are you? What's to be done? I've just got here. My God!\nWhat can we do?\"\n\n\"Wait,\" said Danny O'Rourke calmly, and glanced at his watch; \"wait\nfor another ten minutes! He's over Boston now. And he's waitin' there\nfor me--though he doesn't know it yet. But I'll be droppin' in on\nhim.\"\n\n\"Don't be an utter fool, Danny,\" urged the voice of the Chief; \"there\nisn't a thing you can do. You try to come down on him, and he'll do as\nhe did with the cruisers--just slip aside like lightning and nail you\nwith his damned heat ray when you're below! I'm near Boston now. You\nkeep away. Where can I meet you? We've got to think--got to do\nsomething!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd Danny, before he opened the switch that ended their talk, said\nmeditatively: \"Like lightnin' he moves ... but he'll have to move\n_faster_ than lightnin' to dodge me. And if you're near Boston, stick\naround; I'm comin' now, but not to meet you, Chief; I've got another\nimportant engagement. I'm keepin' it for--for the Infant. And give the\nInfant the credit, Chief; give it all to him, he's earned it: he's\npaid for it in full.\" Then the snap of a switch cut off the sound of\nDanny's voice before it showed a tell-tale quaver.\n\nIt was steady some minutes later, when Danny swept in above the\nmounting clouds that he had learned to know. Beneath them invisible\nfingers of death were sweeping back and forth where men and women ran\nshrieking in terror or waited calmly and dry-eyed for the end. Above\nthem a slender rounded thing wove its pattern of destruction back and\nforth ... back and forth. A spectral ship--a pale phantom, elusive\nand dimly seen until it came against the black of rolling smoke from\nbelow.\n\nBut to Danny O'Rourke, slanting down from tremendous heights, the\nwhite shape was never lost. On the cross hairs of his directional\nsights the ghostly ship hung, and Danny threw his own red rocket like\na living flame over and down where the white one sensed his coming and\nwaited.\n\nBeside him a human voice, high with horror, called to him. \"Come\nback!\" the Chief of the Mountain Division was commanding. \"Danny! For\nthe love of Heaven, turn back!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut the voice was unheard by Danny O'Rourke. There was another voice\nspeaking ... he could almost see the smiling pink and white face of\none beside him who spoke of his \"little tin ship\" ... spoke, too, of a\nwhite ship that would be like a great thunder-cloud ... and of his own\nscreaming meteor that was like the earth ... and there was to be a\nmessenger of death like the hammer of Thor that would flash between\nthe two....\n\nDanny saw the white one slipping easily aside; the ship was swelling\nsuddenly before him--it was close ... but the jagged lightning--the\nripping flash of blue that joined the two craft in a crashing arc--was\nneither seen nor heard by Danny. Danny was too busy to notice, for he\nwas engaged in smiling converse with one whom he called the \"Infant\"\nand whose pink and white face beamed gladly upon him \"like a damned\nlittle cherub,\" as Danny was telling him....\n\nBut the Chief of the Mountain Division who saw all from afar could say\nnothing. He only stared from the lookout of his own speeding plane\nthat framed a picture of two ships; where the red one, flaming from\nwithin, kept on in its swift, straight dive; while the white one fell\nslowly, turning sluggishly to show its gashed and blasted sides ...\ntill the black clouds wrapped them both in a billowy shroud....\n\nBut clouds are no bar to man's inner vision. And the Chief looked\nthrough, as Danny had done, to see as in a lightning flash a world\nbeaten to its knees, hopeless, ravaged and scarred--a world where\ncourage might again be born--a world that would still be a world of\nmen.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Hammer of Thor, by Charles Willard Diffin\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE HAMMER OF THOR ***\n\n***** This file should be named 29202.txt or 29202.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/9/2/0/29202/\n\nProduced by Sankar Viswanathan, Greg Weeks, and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
