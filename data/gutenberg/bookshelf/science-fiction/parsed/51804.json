No man\n              knew at what moment he might be Possessed!\n\n\nBecause of the crowd they held Chandler's trial in the all-purpose room\nof the high school. It smelled of leather and stale sweat. He walked up\nthe three steps to the stage, with the bailiff's hand on his elbow, and\ntook his place at the defendant's table.\n\nChandler's lawyer looked at him without emotion. He was appointed by\nthe court. He was willing to do his job, but his job didn't require him\nto like his client. All he said was, \"Stand up. The judge is coming in.\"\n\nChandler got to his feet and leaned on the table while the bailiff\nchanted his call and the chaplain read some verses from John. He did\nnot listen. The Bible verse came too late to help him, and besides he\nached.\n\nWhen the police arrested him they had not been gentle. There were four\nof them. They were from the plant's own security force and carried\nno guns. They didn't need any; Chandler had put up no resistance\nafter the first few moments--that is, he stopped as soon as he could\nstop--but the police hadn't stopped. He remembered that very clearly.\nHe remembered the nightstick across the side of his head that left his\near squashed and puffy, he remembered the kick in the gut that still\nmade walking painful. He even remembered the series of blows about the\nskull that had knocked him out.\n\nThe bruises along his rib cage and left arm, though, he did not\nremember getting. Obviously the police had been mad enough to keep\nright on subduing him after he was already unconscious.\n\nChandler did not blame them--exactly. He supposed he would have done\nthe same thing.\n\nThe judge was having a long mumble with the court stenographer\napparently about something which had happened in the Union House the\nnight before. Chandler knew Judge Ellithorp slightly. He did not\nexpect to get a fair trial. The previous December the judge himself,\nwhile possessed, had smashed the transmitter of the town's radio\nstation, which he owned, and set fire to the building it occupied. His\nson-in-law had been killed in the fire.\n\nLaughing, the judge waved the reporter back to his seat and glanced\naround the courtroom. His gaze touched Chandler lightly, like the\nflick of the hanging strands of cord that precede a railroad tunnel.\nThe touch carried the same warning. What lay ahead for Chandler was\ndestruction.\n\n\"Read the charge,\" ordered Judge Ellithorp. He spoke very loudly.\nThere were more than six hundred persons in the auditorium; the judge\ndidn't want any of them to miss a word.\n\nThe bailiff ordered Chandler to stand and informed him that he was\naccused of having, on the seventeenth day of June last, committed on\nthe person of Margaret Flershem, a minor, an act of rape--\"Louder!\"\nordered the judge testily.\n\n\"Yes, Your Honor,\" said the bailiff, and inflated his chest. \"An Act\nof Rape under Threat of Bodily Violence,\" he cried; \"and Did Further\nCommit on the Person of Said Margaret Flershem an Act of Aggravated\nAssault--\"\n\nChandler rubbed his aching side, looking at the ceiling. He remembered\nthe look in Peggy Flershem's eyes as he forced himself on her. She was\nonly sixteen years old, and at that time he hadn't even known her name.\n\nThe bailiff boomed on: \"--and Did Further Commit on that Same\nSeventeenth Day of June Last on the Person of Ingovar Porter an Act of\nAssault with Intent to Rape, the Foregoing Being a True Bill Handed\nDown by the Grand Jury of Sepulpas County in Extraordinary Session\nAssembled, the Eighteenth Day of June Last.\"\n\nJudge Ellithorp looked satisfied as the bailiff sat down, quite winded.\nWhile the judge hunted through the papers on his desk the crowd in the\nauditorium stirred and murmured.\n\nA child began to cry.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe judge stood up and pounded his gavel. \"What is it? What's the\nmatter with him? You, Dundon!\" The court attendant the judge was\nlooking at hurried over and spoke to the child's mother, then reported\nto the judge.\n\n\"I dunno, Your Honor. All he says is something scared him.\"\n\nThe judge was enraged. \"Well, that's just fine! Now we have to take up\nthe time of all these good people, probably for no reason, and hold up\nthe business of this court, just because of a child. Bailiff! I want\nyou to clear this courtroom of all children under--\" he hesitated,\ncalculating voting blocks in his head--\"all children under the age\nof six. Dr. Palmer, are you there? Well, you better go ahead with\nthe--prayer.\" The judge could not make himself say \"the exorcism.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, madam,\" he added to the mother of the crying two-year-old.\n\"If you have someone to leave the child with, I'll instruct the\nattendants to save your place for you.\" She was also a voter.\n\nDr. Palmer rose, very grave, as he was embarrassed. He glared around\nthe all-purpose room, defying anyone to smile, as he chanted: \"Domina\nPythonis, I command you, leave! Leave, Hel! Leave, Heloym! Leave,\nSother and Thetragrammaton, leave, all unclean ones! I command you!\nIn the name of God, in all of His manifestations!\" He sat down again,\nstill very grave. He knew that he did not make nearly as fine a showing\nas Father Lon, with his resonant _in nomina Jesu Christi et Sancti\nUbaldi_ and his censer, but the post of exorcist was filled in strict\nrotation, one month to a denomination, ever since the troubles started.\nDr. Palmer was a Unitarian. Exorcisms had not been in the curriculum at\nthe seminary and he had been forced to invent his own.\n\nChandler's lawyer tapped him on the shoulder. \"Last chance to change\nyour mind,\" he said.\n\n\"No. I'm not guilty, and that's the way I want to plead.\"\n\nThe lawyer shrugged and stood up, waiting for the judge to notice him.\n\nChandler, for the first time, allowed himself to meet the eyes of the\ncrowd.\n\nHe studied the jury first. He knew some of them casually--it was not a\nbig enough town to command a jury of total strangers for any defendant,\nand Chandler had lived there most of his life. He recognized Pop\nMatheson, old and very stiff, who ran the railroad station cigar stand.\nTwo of the other men were familiar as faces passed in the street. The\nforewoman, though, was a stranger. She sat there very composed and\nfrowning, and all he knew about her was that she wore funny hats.\nYesterday's had been red roses when she was selected from the panel;\ntoday's was, of all things, a stuffed bird.\n\nHe did not think that any of them were possessed. He was not so sure of\nthe audience.\n\nHe saw girls he had dated in high school, long before he met Margot;\nmen he worked with at the plant. They all glanced at him, but he was\nnot sure who was looking out through some of those familiar eyes. The\nvisitors reliably watched all large gatherings, at least momentarily;\nit would be surprising if none of them were here.\n\n\"All right, how do you plead,\" said Judge Ellithorp at last.\n\nChandler's lawyer straightened up. \"Not guilty, Your Honor, by reason\nof temporary pandemic insanity.\"\n\nThe judge looked pleased. The crowd murmured, but they were\npleased too. They had him dead to rights and it would have been a\ndisappointment if Chandler had pleaded guilty. They wanted to see\none of the vilest criminals in contemporary human society caught,\nexposed, convicted and punished; they did not want to miss a step of\nthe process. Already in the playground behind the school three deputies\nfrom the sheriff's office were loading their rifles, while the school\njanitor chalked lines around the handball court to mark where the crowd\nwitnessing the execution would be permitted to stand.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe prosecution made its case very quickly. Mrs. Porter testified\nthat she worked at McKelvey Bros., the antibiotics plant, where the\ndefendant also worked. Yes, that was him. She had been attracted by the\nnoise from the culture room last--let's see--\"Was it the seventeenth\nday of June last?\" prompted the prosecutor, and Chandler's attorney\ninstinctively gathered his muscles to rise, hesitated, glanced at\nhis client and shrugged. That was right, it was the seventeenth.\nIncautiously she went right into the room. She should have known\nbetter, she admitted. She should have called the plant police right\naway, but, well, they hadn't had any trouble at the plant, you\nknow, and--well, she didn't. She was a stupid woman, for all that\nshe was rather good-looking, and insatiably curious. She had seen\nPeggy Flershem on the floor. \"She was all _blood_. And her clothes\nwere--And she was, I mean her--her body was--\" With relentless tact the\nprosecutor allowed her to stammer out her observation that the girl had\nclearly been raped. And she had seen Chandler laughing and breaking up\nthe place, throwing racks of cultures through the windows, upsetting\ntrays. Of course she had crossed herself and tried a quick exorcism but\nthere was no visible effect; then Chandler had leaped at her. \"He was\n_hateful_! He was just _foul_!\" But as he began to attack her the plant\npolice came, drawn by her screams.\n\nChandler's attorney did not question.\n\nPeggy Flershem's deposition was introduced without objection from the\ndefense. But she had little to say anyway, having been dazed at first\nand unconscious later. The plant police testified to having arrested\nChandler; a doctor described in chaste medical words the derangements\nChandler had worked on Peggy Flershem's virgin anatomy. There was no\nquestion from Chandler's lawyer--and, for that matter, nothing to\nquestion. Chandler did not hope to pretend that he had not ravished and\nnearly killed one girl, then done his best to repeat the process on\nanother. Sitting there as the doctor testified, Chandler was able to\ntally every break and bruise against the memory of what his own body\nhad done. He had been a spectator then, too, as remote from the event\nas he was now; but that was why they had him on trial. That was what\nthey did not believe.\n\nAt twelve-thirty the prosecution rested its case, Judge Ellithorp\nlooking very pleased. He recessed the court for one hour for lunch, and\nthe guards took Chandler back to the detention cell in the basement of\nthe school.\n\nTwo Swiss cheese sandwiches and a wax-paper carton of chocolate\nmilk were on the desk. They were Chandler's lunch. As they had been\nstanding, the sandwiches were crusty and the milk lukewarm. He ate them\nanyway. He knew what the judge looked pleased about. At one-thirty\nChandler's lawyer would put him on the stand, and no one would pay\nvery much attention to what he had to say, and the jury would be out\nat most twenty minutes, and the verdict would be guilty. The judge was\npleased because he would be able to pronounce sentence no later than\nfour o'clock, no matter what. They had formed the habit of holding the\nexecutions at sundown. As, at that time of year, sundown was after\nseven, it would all go very well--for everyone but Chandler. For\nChandler it would be the end.\n\n\nII\n\nThe odd thing about Chandler's dilemma was not merely that he was\ninnocent--in a way, that is--but that many who were guilty (in a way;\nas guilty as he himself, at any rate) were free and honored citizens.\nChandler himself was a widower because his own wife had been murdered.\nHe had seen the murderer leaving the scene of the crime, and the man\nhe had seen was in the courtroom today, watching Chandler's own trial.\nOf the six hundred or so in the court, at least fifty were known to\nhave taken part in one or more provable acts of murder, rape, arson,\ntheft, sodomy, vandalism, assault and battery or a dozen other offenses\nindictable under the laws of the state. Of course, that could be said\nof almost any community in the world in those years; Chandler's was not\nunique. What had put Chandler in the dock was not what his body had\nbeen seen to do, but the place in which it had been seen to do it. For\neverybody knew that medicine and agriculture were never molested by the\ndemons.\n\nChandler's own lawyer had pointed that out to him the day before the\ntrial. \"If it was anywhere but at the McKelvey plant, all right, but\nthere's never been any trouble there. You know that. The trouble with\nyou laymen is you think of lawyers in terms of Perry Mason, right?\nRabbit out of the hat stuff. Well, I can't do that. I can only present\nyour case, whatever it is, the best way possible. And the best thing\nI can do for your case right now is tell you you haven't got one.\" At\nthat time the lawyer was still trying to be fair. He was even casting\naround for some thought he could use to convince himself that his\nclient was innocent, though he had frankly admitted as soon as he\nintroduced himself that he didn't have much hope there.\n\nChandler protested that he didn't have to commit rape. He'd been a\nwidower for a year, but--\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" said the lawyer. \"Listen. You can't make an ordinary\nclaim of possession stick, but what about good old-fashioned insanity?\"\nChandler looked puzzled, so the lawyer explained. Wasn't it possible\nthat Chandler was--consciously, subconsciously, unconsciously, call it\nwhat you will--trying to get revenge for what had happened to his own\nwife?\n\nNo, said Chandler, certainly not! But then he had to stop and think.\nAfter all, he had never been possessed before; in fact, he had always\nretained a certain skepticism about \"possession\"--it seemed like such a\nconvenient way for anyone to do any illicit thing he chose--until the\nmoment when he looked up to see Peggy Flershem walking into the culture\nroom with a tray of agar disks, and was astonished to find himself\nstriking her with the wrench in his hand and ripping at her absurdly\nfloral-printed slacks. Maybe his case was different. Maybe it wasn't\nthe sort of possession that struck at random; maybe he was just off his\nrocker.\n\nMargot, his wife, had been cut up cruelly. He had seen his friend, Jack\nSouther, leaving his home hurriedly as he approached; and although he\nhad thought that the stains on his clothes looked queerly like blood,\nnothing in that prepared him for what he found in the rumpus room.\nIt had taken him some time to identify the spread-out dissection on\nthe floor with his wife Margot.... \"No,\" he told his lawyer, \"I was\nshaken up, of course. The worst time was the next night, when there\nwas a knock on the door and I opened it and it was Jack. He'd come\nto apologize. I--fell apart; but I got over it. I tell you I was\npossessed, that's all.\"\n\n\"And I tell you that defense will put you right in front of a firing\nsquad,\" said his lawyer. \"And _that's_ all.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFive or six others had been executed for hoaxing; Chandler was familiar\nwith the ritual. He even understood it, in a way. The world had gone to\npot in the previous two years. The real enemy was out of reach; when\nany citizen might run wild and, when caught, relapse into his own self,\nterrified and sick, there was a need to strike back. But the enemy was\ninvisible. The hoaxers were only whipping boys--but they were the only\ntargets vengeance had.\n\nThe real enemy had struck the entire world in a single night. One\nday the people of the world went about their business in the gloomy\nknowledge that they were likely to make mistakes but with, at least,\nthe comfort that the mistakes would be their own. The next day had\nno such comfort. The next day anyone, anywhere, was likely to find\nhimself seized, possessed, working evil or whimsy without intention and\nhelplessly.\n\nChandler stood up, kicked the balled-up wax paper from his sandwiches\nacross the floor and swore violently.\n\nHe was beginning to wake from the shock that had gripped him. \"Damn\nfool,\" he said to himself. He had no particular reason. Like the\nworld, he needed a whipping boy too, if only himself. \"Damn fool, you\nknow they're going to shoot you!\"\n\nHe stretched and twisted his body violently, alone in the middle of the\nroom, in silence. He _had_ to wake up. He _had_ to start thinking. In a\nquarter of an hour or less the court would reconvene, and from then it\nwas only a steady, quick slide to the grave.\n\nIt was better to do anything than to do nothing. He examined the\nwindows of his improvised cell. They were above his head and barred;\nstanding on the table, he could see feet walking outside, in the paved\nplay-yard of the school. He discarded the thought of escaping that\nway; there was no one to smuggle him a file, and there was no time.\nHe studied the door to the hall. It was not impossible that when the\nguard opened it he could jump him, knock him out, run ... run where?\nThe room had been a storage place for athletic equipment at the end of\na hall; the hall led only to the stairs and the stairs emerged into the\ncourtroom. It was quite likely, he thought, that the hall had another\nflight of stairs somewhere farther along, or through another room. What\nhad he spent his taxes on these years, if not for schools designed with\nmore than one exit in case of fire? But as he had not thought to mark\nan escape route when he was brought in, it did him no good.\n\nThe guard, however, had a gun. Chandler lifted up an edge of the table\nand tried to shake one of the legs. They did not shake; that part of\nhis taxes had been well enough spent, he thought wryly. The chair?\nCould he smash the chair to get a club, which would give him a weapon\nto get the guard's gun?...\n\nBefore he reached the chair the door opened and his lawyer came in.\n\n\"Sorry I'm late,\" he said briskly. \"Well. As your attorney I have to\ntell you they've presented a damaging case. As I see it--\"\n\n\"What case?\" Chandler demanded. \"I never denied the acts. What else did\nthey prove?\"\n\n\"Oh, God!\" said his lawyer, not quite loudly enough to be insulting.\n\"Do we have to go over that again? Your claim of possession would make\na defense if it had happened anywhere else. We know that these cases\nexist, but we also know that they follow a pattern. Some areas seem to\nbe immune--medical establishments, pharmaceutical plants among them. So\nthey proved that all this happened in a pharmaceutical plant. I advise\nyou to plead guilty.\"\n\nChandler sat down on the edge of the table, controlling himself very\nwell, he thought. He only asked: \"Would that do me any good at all?\"\n\nThe lawyer reflected, gazing at the ceiling. \"... No. I guess it\nwouldn't.\"\n\nChandler nodded. \"So what else shall we talk about? Want to compare\nnotes about where you were and I was the night the President went\npossessed?\"\n\nThe lawyer was irritated. He kept his mouth shut for a moment until he\nthought he could keep from showing it. Outside a vendor was hawking\namulets: \"St. Ann beads! Witch knots! Fresh garlic, local grown, best\nin town!\" The lawyer shook his head.\n\n\"All right,\" he said, \"it's your life. We'll do it your way. Anyway,\ntime's up; Sergeant Grantz will be banging on the door any minute.\"\n\nHe zipped up his briefcase. Chandler did not move. \"They don't give\nus much time anyway,\" the lawyer added, angry at Chandler and at\nhoaxers in general but not willing to say so. \"Grantz is a stickler for\npromptness.\"\n\nChandler found a crumb of cheese by his hand and absently ate it. The\nlawyer watched him and glanced at his watch. \"Oh, hell,\" he said,\npicked up his briefcase and kicked the base of the door. \"Grantz!\nWhat's the matter with you? You asleep out there?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nChandler was sworn, gave his name, admitted the truth of everything the\nprevious witnesses had said. The faces were still aimed at him, every\none. He could not read them at all any more, could not tell if they\nwere friendly or hating, there were too many and they all had eyes. The\njurors sat on their funeral-parlor chairs like cadavers, embalmed and\npropped, the dead witnessing a wake for the living. Only the forewoman\nin the funny hat showed signs of life, looking alertly at Chandler,\nat the judge, at the man next to her, around the auditorium. Maybe it\nwas a good sign. At least she did not have the frozen in concrete,\nguilty-as-hell look of the others.\n\nHis attorney asked him the question he had been waiting for: \"Tell\nus, in your own words, what happened.\" Chandler opened his mouth, and\npaused. Curiously, he had forgotten what he wanted to say. He had\nrehearsed this moment again and again; but all that came out was:\n\n\"I didn't do it. I mean, I did the acts, but I was possessed. That's\nall. Others have done worse, under the same circumstances, and been\nlet off. Just as Fisher was acquitted for murdering the Learnards, as\nDraper got off after what he did to the Cline boy. As Jack Souther\nover there was let off after he murdered my own wife. They should\nbe. They couldn't help themselves. Whatever this thing is that takes\ncontrol, I know it can't be fought. My God, you can't even _try_ to\nfight it!\"\n\nHe was not getting through. The faces had not changed. The forewoman\nof the jury was now searching systematically through her pocketbook,\ntaking each item out and examining it, putting it back and taking\nout another. But between times she looked at him and at least her\nexpression wasn't hostile. He said, addressing her:\n\n\"That's all there is to it. It wasn't me running my body. It was\nsomeone else. I swear it before all of you, and before God.\"\n\nThe prosecutor did not bother to question him.\n\nChandler went back to his seat and sat down and watched the next twenty\nminutes go by in the wink of an eye, rapid, rapid, they were in a hurry\nto shoot him. He could hardly believe that Judge Ellithorp could speak\nso fast, the jurymen rise and file out at a gallop, zip, whisk, and\nthey were back again. Too fast! he cried silently, time had gone into\nhigh gear; but he knew that it was only his imagination. The twenty\nminutes had been a full twelve hundred seconds. And then time, as if\nto make amends, came to a stop, abrupt, brakes-on. The judge asked the\njury for their verdict and it was an eternity before the forewoman\narose.\n\nShe was beginning to look rather disheveled. Beaming at\nChandler--_surely_ the woman was rather odd, it couldn't be just his\nimagination--she fumbled in her pocketbook for the slip of paper with\nthe verdict. But she wore an expression of suppressed laughter.\n\n\"I _knew_ I had it,\" she cried triumphantly and waved the slip above\nher head. \"Now, let's see.\" She held it before her eyes and squinted.\n\"Oh, yes. Judge, we the jury, and so forth and so on--\"\n\nShe paused to wink at Judge Ellithorp. An uncertain worried murmur\nwelled up in the auditorium. \"All that junk, Judge,\" she explained,\n\"anyway, we unanimously--but _unanimously_, love!--find this son of a\nbitch innocent. Why,\" she giggled, \"we think he ought to get a medal,\nyou know? I tell you what you do, love, you go right over and give him\na big wet kiss and say you're sorry.\" She kept on talking, but no one\nheard. The murmur became a mass scream.\n\n\"Stop, stop her!\" bawled the judge, dropping his glasses. \"Bailiff!\"\n\nThe scream became a word, in many voices chorused: _Possessed!_ And\nbeyond doubt the woman was. The men around her hurled themselves away,\nas from leprosy among them, and then washed back like a lynch mob. She\nwas giggling as they fell on her. \"Got a cigarette? No cigarettes in\nthis lousy bag--oh.\" She screamed as they touched her, went limp and\nscreamed again.\n\nIt was a different note this time, pure hysteria: \"I couldn't _stop_.\nOh, _God_.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nChandler caught his lawyer by the arm and jerked him away from staring\nat the scene. All of a sudden he was alive again. \"You, damn it.\nListen! The jury acquitted me, right?\"\n\nThe lawyer was startled. \"Don't be ridiculous. It's a clear case of--\"\n\n\"Be a lawyer, man! You live on technicalities, don't you? Make this one\nwork for me!\"\n\nThe attorney gave him a queer, thoughtful look, hesitated, shrugged and\ngot to his feet. He had to shout to be heard. \"Your honor! I take it my\nclient is free to go.\"\n\nHe made almost as much of a stir as the sobbing woman, but he\noutshouted the storm. \"The jury's verdict is on record. Granted there\nwas an _apparent_ case of possession. Nevertheless--\"\n\nJudge Ellithorp yelled back: \"No nonsense, you! Listen to me, young\nman--\"\n\nThe lawyer snapped, \"Permission to approach the bench.\"\n\n\"Granted.\"\n\nChandler sat unable to move, watching the brief, stormy conference.\nIt was painful to be coming back to life. It was agony to hope. At\nleast, he thought detachedly, his lawyer was fighting for him; the\nprosecutor's face was a thundercloud.\n\nThe lawyer came back, with the expression of a man who has won a\nvictory he did not expect, and did not want. \"Your last chance,\nChandler. Change your plea to guilty.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Don't push your luck, boy! The judge has agreed to accept a plea.\nThey'll throw you out of town, of course. But you'll be alive.\"\nChandler hesitated. \"Make up your mind! The best I can do otherwise is\na mistrial, and that means you'll get convicted by another jury next\nweek.\"\n\nChandler said, testing his luck: \"You're sure they'll keep their end of\nthe bargain?\"\n\nThe lawyer shook his head, his expression that of a man who smells\nsomething unpleasant. \"Your honor! I ask you to discharge the jury. My\nclient wishes to change his plea.\"\n\n... In the school's chemistry lab, an hour later, Chandler discovered\nthat the lawyer had left out one little detail. Outside there was a\nsound of motors idling, the police car that would dump him at the\ntown's limits; inside was a thin, hollow hiss. It was the sound of a\nBunsen burner, and in its blue flame a crudely shaped iron changed\nslowly from cherry to orange to glowing straw. It had the shape of a\nletter \"H\".\n\n\"H\" for \"hoaxer.\" The mark they were about to put on his forehead would\nbe with him wherever he went and as long as he lived, which would\nprobably not be long. \"H\" for \"hoaxer,\" so that a glance would show\nthat he had been convicted of the worst offense of all.\n\nNo one spoke to him as the sheriff's man took the iron out of the fire,\nbut three husky policemen held his arms while he screamed.\n\n\nIII\n\nThe pain was still burning when Chandler awoke the next day. He wished\nhe had a bandage, but he didn't, and that was that.\n\nHe was in a freight car--had hopped it on the run at the yards, daring\nto sneak back into town long enough for that. He could not hope to\nhitchhike, with that mark on him. Anyway, hitchhiking was an invitation\nto trouble.\n\nThe railroads were safer--far safer than either cars or air transport,\nnotoriously a lightning-rod attracting possession. Chandler was\nsurprised when the train came crashing to a stop, each freight car\nsmashing against the couplings of the one ahead, the engine jolting\nforward and stopping again.\n\nThen there was silence. It endured.\n\nChandler, who had been slowly waking after a night of very little\nsleep, sat up against the wall of the boxcar and wondered what was\nwrong.\n\nIt seemed remiss to start a day without signing the Cross or hearing a\nfew exorcismal verses. It seemed to be mid-morning, time for work to\nbe beginning at the plant. The lab men would be streaming in, their\namulets examined at the door. The chaplains would be wandering about,\nready to pray a possessing spirit out. Chandler, who kept an open mind,\nhad considerable doubt of the effectiveness of all the amulets and\nspells--certainly they had not kept him from a brutal rape--but he felt\nuneasy without them.... The train still was not moving. In the silence\nhe could hear the distant huffing of the engine.\n\nHe went to the door, supporting himself with one hand on the wooden\nwall, and looked out.\n\nThe tracks followed the roll of a river, their bed a few feet higher\nthan an empty three-lane highway, which in turn was a dozen feet above\nthe water. As he looked out the engine brayed twice. The train jolted\nuncertainly, then stopped again.\n\nThen there was a very long time when nothing happened at all.\n\nFrom Chandler's car he could not see the engine. He was on the convex\nof the curve, and the other door of the car was sealed. He did not need\nto see it to know that something was wrong. There should have been a\nbrakeman running with a flare to ward off other trains; but there was\nnot. There should have been a station, or at least a water tank, to\naccount for the stop in the first place. There was not. Something had\ngone wrong, and Chandler knew what it was. Not the details, but the\ncentral fact that lay behind this and behind almost everything that\nwent wrong these days.\n\nThe engineer was possessed. It had to be that.\n\nYet it was odd, he thought, as odd as his own trouble. He had chosen\nthis car with care. It contained eight refrigerator cars full of\npharmaceuticals, and if anything was known about the laws governing\npossession, as his lawyer had told him, it was that such things were\nalmost never interfered with.\n\nChandler jumped down to the roadbed, slipped on the crushed rock and\nalmost fell. He had forgotten the wound on his forehead. He clutched\nthe sill of the car door, where an ankh and fleur-de-lis had been\nchalked to ward off demons, until the sudden rush of blood subsided and\nthe pain began to relent. After a moment he walked gingerly to the end\nof the car, slipped between the cars, dodged the couplers and climbed\nthe ladder to its roof.\n\nIt was a warm, bright, silent day. Nothing moved. From his height he\ncould see the Diesel at the front of the train and the caboose at its\nrear. No people. The train was halted a quarter-mile from where the\ntracks swooped across the river on a suspension bridge. Away from the\nriver, the side of the tracks that had been hidden from him before, was\nan uneven rock cut and, above it, the slope of a mountain.\n\nBy looking carefully he could spot the signs of a number of homes\nwithin half a mile or so--the corner of a roof, a glassed-in porch\nbuilt to command a river view, a twenty-foot television antenna poking\nthrough the trees. There was also the curve of a higher road along\nwhich the homes were strung.\n\nChandler took thought. He was alive and free, two gifts more gracious\nthan he had had any right to expect. However, he would need food and\nhe would need at least some sort of bandage for his forehead. He had\na wool cap, stolen from the high school, which would hide the mark,\nthough what it would do to the burn on his skin was something else\nagain.\n\nChandler climbed down the ladder. With considerable pain he gentled\nthe cap over the great raw H on his forehead and began to climb the\nmountain.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe knocked on the first door he came to, a great old three-story house\nwith well tended gardens.\n\nThere was a wait. The air smelled warmly of honeysuckle and mown\ngrass, with wild onions chopped down by the blades of the mower. It\nwas pleasant, or would have been in happier times. He knocked again,\nperemptorily, and the door was opened at once. Evidently someone had\nbeen right inside, listening.\n\nA man stared at him. \"Stranger, what do you want?\" He was short, plump,\nwith an extremely thick and unkempt beard. It did not appear to have\nbeen grown for its own sake, for where the facial hair could not be\ncoaxed to grow his skin had the gross pits of old acne.\n\nChandler said glibly: \"Good morning. I'm working my way east. I need\nsomething to eat and I'm willing to work for it.\"\n\nThe man withdrew, leaving the upper half of the Dutch door open. As it\nlooked in on only a vestibule it did not tell Chandler much. There was\none curious thing--a lath and cardboard sign, shaped like an arc of a\nrainbow, lettered:\n\n    WELCOME TO ORPHALESE\n\nHe puzzled over it and dismissed it. The entrance room, apart from\nthe sign, had a knickknack shelf of Japanese carved ivory and an\nold-fashioned umbrella rack, but that added nothing to his knowledge.\nHe had already guessed that the owners of this home were well off. Also\nit had been recently painted; so they were not demoralized, as so much\nof the world had been demoralized, by the coming of the possessors.\nEven the elaborate sculpturing of its hedges had been maintained.\n\nThe man came back and with him was a girl of fifteen or so. She was\ntall, slim and rather homely, with a large jaw and an oval face. \"Guy,\nhe's not much to look at,\" she said to the pockmarked man. \"Meggie,\nshall I let him in?\" he asked. \"Guy, you might as well,\" she\nshrugged, staring at Chandler with interest but not sympathy.\n\n\"Stranger, come along,\" said the man named Guy, and led him through a\nshort hall into an enormous living room, a room two stories high with a\nten-foot fireplace.\n\nChandler's first thought was that he had stumbled in upon a wake. The\nroom was neatly laid out in rows of folding chairs, more than half of\nthem occupied. He entered from the side, but all the occupants of the\nchairs were looking toward him. He returned their stares; he had had\na good deal of practice lately in looking back at staring faces, he\nreflected. \"Stranger, go on,\" said the man who had let him in, nudging\nhim, \"and meet the people of Orphalese.\"\n\nChandler hardly heard him. He had not expected anything like this. It\nwas a meeting, a Daumier caricature of a Thursday Afternoon Literary\nCircle, old men with faces like moons, young women with faces like\nhags. They were strained, haggard and fearful, and a surprising number\nof them showed some sort of physical defect, a bandaged leg, an arm in\na sling or merely the marks of pain on the features. \"Stranger, go in,\"\nrepeated the man, and it was only then that Chandler noticed the man\nwas holding a pistol, pointed at his head.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nChandler sat in the rear of the room, watching. There must be thousands\nof little colonies like this, he reflected; with the breakdown of\nlong-distance communication the world had been atomized. There was a\nreal fear, well justified, of living in large groups, for they too were\nlightning rods for possession. The world was stumbling along, but it\nwas lame in all its members; a planetary lobotomy had stolen from it\nits wisdom and plan. If, he reflected dryly, it had ever had any.\n\nBut of course things were better in the old days. The world had seemed\non the brink of blowing itself up, but at least it was by its own hand.\nThen came Christmas.\n\nIt had happened at Christmas, and the first sign was on nation-wide\ntelevision. The old President, balding, grave and plump, was making a\nspecial address to the nation, urging good will to men and, please,\nartificial trees because of the fire danger in the event of H-bomb\nraids; in the middle of a sentence twenty million viewers had seen him\nstop, look dazedly around and say, in a breathless mumble, what sounded\nlike: \"_Disht dvornyet ilgt_.\" He had then picked up the Bible on the\ndesk before him and thrown it at the television camera.\n\nThe last the televiewers had seen was the fluttering pages of the Book,\ngrowing larger as it crashed against the lens, then a flicker and a\nblinding shot of the studio lights as the cameraman jumped away and\nthe instrument swiveled to stare mindlessly upward. Twenty minutes\nlater the President was dead, as his Secretary of Health and Welfare,\nhurrying with him back to the White House, calmly took a hand grenade\nfrom a Marine guard at the gate and blew the President's party to\nfragments.\n\nFor the President's seizure was only the first and most conspicuous.\n\"_Disht dvornyet ilgt._\" C.I.A. specialists were playing the tapes\nof the broadcast feverishly, electronically cleaning the mumble and\nstir from the studio away from the words to try to learn, first, the\nlanguage and second what the devil it meant; but the President who\nordered it was dead before the first reel spun, and his successor was\nnot quite sworn in when it became his time to die. The ceremony was\ninterrupted for an emergency call from the War Room, where a very\nnearly hysterical four-star general was trying to explain why he had\nordered the immediate firing of every live missile in his command\nagainst Washington, D. C.\n\nOver five hundred missiles were involved. In most of the sites the\norder was disobeyed, but in six of them, unfortunately, unquestioning\ndiscipline won out, thus ending not only the swearing in, the general's\nweeping explanation, the spinning of tapes, but also some two million\nlives in the District of Columbia, Maryland, Virginia and (through\nmalfunctioning relays on two missiles) Pennsylvania and Vermont. But it\nwas only the beginning.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThese were the first cases of possession seen by the world in some\nfive hundred years, since the great casting out of devils of the\nMiddle Ages. A thousand more occurred in the next few days, a hundred\nin the next hours. The timetable was made up out of scattered reports\nin the wire-service newsrooms, while they still had facilities\nfor spot coverage in any part of the world. (That lasted almost a\nweek.) They identified 237 cases of possession by noon of the next\nday. Disregarding the dubious items--the Yankee pitcher who leaped\nfrom the Manhattan bridge (he had Bright's disease), the warden of\nSan Quentin who seated himself in the gas chamber and, literally,\nkicked the bucket (did he know the Grand Jury was subpoenaing his\nbooks?)--disregarding these, the chronology of major cases that evening\nwas:\n\n8:27 PM, E.S.T.: President has attack on television.\n\n8:28 PM, E.S.T.: Prime Minister of England orders bombing raid against\nIsrael, alleging secret plot (order not carried out).\n\n8:28 PM, E.S.T.: Captain of SSN _Ethan Allen_, surfaced near Montauk\nPoint, orders crash dive and course change, proceeding submerged at\nflank speed to New York Harbor.\n\n9:10 PM, E.S.T.: Eastern Airlines six-engine jet makes wheels-up\nlanding on roof of Pentagon, breaking some 1500 windows but causing no\nother major damage (except to the people aboard the jet); record of\nthis incident fragmentary because entire site charred black in fusion\nattack two hours later.\n\n9:23 PM, E.S.T.: Rosalie Pan, musical-comedy star, jumps off stage,\nruns up center aisle and vanishes in cab, wearing beaded bra, G-string\nand $2500 headdress. Her movements are traced to Newark airport where\nshe boards TWA jetliner, which is never seen again.\n\n9:50 PM, E.S.T.: Entire S.A.C. fleet of 1200 jet bombers takes off\nfor rendezvous over Newfoundland, where 72% are compelled to ditch\nas tankers fail to keep refueling rendezvous. (Orders committing the\naircraft originate with S.A.C. commander, found to be a suicide.)\n\n10.14 PM, E.S.T.: Submarine fusion explosion destroys 40% of New York\nCity. Analysis of fallout indicates U.S. Navy Polaris missiles were\ndetonated underwater in bay; by elimination it is deduced that the\nsubmarine was the _Ethan Allen_.\n\n10:50 PM, E.S.T.: President's party assassinated by Secretary of\nHealth, Education and Welfare; Secretary then dies on bayonet of Marine\nguard who furnished the grenade.\n\n10:55 PM, E.S.T. Satellite stations observe great nuclear explosions in\nChina and Tibet.\n\n11:03 PM, E.S.T.: Heavily loaded munitions barges exploded near North\nSea dikes of Holland; dikes breached, 1800 square miles of reclaimed\nland flooded out....\n\nAnd so on. The incidents were countless. But before long, before even\nthe C.I.A. had finished the first playthrough of the tapes, before\ntheir successors in the task identified _Disht dvornyet ilgt_ as a\nUkrainian dialect rendering of, My God, it works!--before all this, one\nfact was already apparent. There were many incidents scattered around\nthe world, but not one of them took place in Russia itself.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWarsaw was ablaze, China pockmarked with blasts, East Berlin demolished\nalong with its western sector, in eight rounds fired from a U.S. Army\nnuclear cannon. But the U.S.S.R. had not suffered at all, as far as\ncould be told by the prying eyes in orbit; and that fact was reason\nenough for it to suffer very greatly very soon.\n\nWithin minutes of this discovery what remained of the military strength\nof the Western world was roaring through airless space toward the most\nlikely targets of the East.\n\nOne unscathed missile base in Alaska completed a full shoot, seven\nmissiles with fusion war-heads. The three American bases that survived\nat all in the Mediterranean fired what they had. Even Britain, which\nhad already watched the fire-tails of the American missiles departing\non suicide missions, managed to resurrect its own two prototype\nBlue Streaks from their racks, where they had moldered since the\ncancellation of the British missile program. One of these museum-pieces\ndestroyed itself in launching, but the other chugged painfully across\nthe sky, the tortoise following the flight of the hares. It arrived a\nfull half-hour after the newer, hotter missiles. It might as well not\nhave bothered. There was not much left to destroy.\n\nIt was fortunate for the Communists that most of the Western arsenal\nhad already spent itself in suicide. What was left wiped out Moscow,\nLeningrad and nine other cities. It was even fortunate for the whole\nworld, for this was the Apocalypse they had dreaded, every possible\nnuclear weapon committed. But the circumstances were such--hasty\norders, often at once recalled; confusion; panic--that most were\nunfused, many others merely tore great craters in the quickly healing\nsurface of the sea. The fallout was locally murderous but quite spotty.\n\nAnd the conventional forces invading Russia found nothing to fight. The\nRussians were as confused as they. There were not many survivors of the\nvery top brass, and no one seemed to know just what had happened.\n\nWas the Secretary of the C.P., U.S.S.R. behind that terrible brief\nagony? As he was dead before it was over, there was no way to tell.\nMore than a quarter of a billion lives went into mushroom-shaped\nclouds, and nearly half of them were Russian, Latvian, Tatar and\nKalmuck. The Peace Commission squabbled for a month, until the\nbreakdown of communications cut them off from their governments and\neach other; and in that way, for a time, there was peace.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis was the sort of peace that was left, thought Chandler looking\naround at the queer faces and queerer surroundings, the peace of\nmedieval baronies, cut off from the world, untouched where the rain\nof fallout had passed by but hardly civilized any more. Even his own\nhome town, trying to take his life in a form of law, reduced at last\nto torture and exile to cast him out, was not the civilization he had\ngrown up in but something new and ugly.\n\nThere was a great deal of talk he did not understand because he could\nnot quite hear it, though they looked at him. Then Guy, with the gun,\nled him up to the front of the room. They had constructed an improvised\nplatform out of plywood panels resting on squat, heavy boxes that\nlooked like empty ammunition crates. On the dais was a dentist's chair,\nbolted to the plywood; and in the chair, strapped in, baby spotlights\non steel-tube frames glaring on her, was a girl. She looked at Chandler\nwith regretting eyes but did not speak.\n\n\"Stranger, get up there,\" said Guy, prodding him from behind, and\nChandler took a plain wooden chair next to the girl.\n\n\"People of Orphalese,\" cried the teen-age cutie named Meggie, \"we have\ntwo more brands to save from the imps!\"\n\nThe men and women in the audience cackled or shrilled \"Save them!\nSave them!\" They all had a look of invisible uniforms, Chandler saw,\nlike baseball players in the lobby of a hotel or soldiers in a diner\noutside the gate of their post; they were all of a type. Their type was\nsomething strange. Some were tall, some short; there were old, fat,\nlean and young around them; but they all wore about them a look of\nglowing excitement, muted by an aura of suffering and pain. They wore,\nin a word, the look of bigots.\n\nThe bound girl was not one of them. She might have been twenty years\nold or as much as thirty. She might have been pretty. It was hard to\ntell; she wore no makeup, her hair strung raggedly to her neck, and\nher face was drawn into a tight, lean line. It was her eyes that were\nalive. She saw Chandler and she was sorry for him. And he saw, as he\nturned to look at her, that she was manacled to the dentist's chair.\n\n\"People of Orphalese,\" chanted Guy, standing behind Chandler with the\nmuzzle of the gun against his neck, \"the _meeting_ of the Orphalese\nSelf-Preservation _Society_ will now come to _order_.\" There was an\napproving, hungry murmur from the audience.\n\n\"Well, people of _Orphalese_,\" Guy went on in his singsong, \"the\nagenda for the day is first the salvation of we _Orphalese_ on\nMcGuire's _Mountain_.\"\n\n(\"All saved, all of us saved,\" rolled a murmur from the congregation.)\nA lean, red-headed man bounded to the platform and fussed with the\nstand of spotlights, turning one of them full on Chandler.\n\n\"People of Orphalese, as we are _saved_, do I have your consent to\n_pass on_ and proceed to the next order of _business_?\"\n\n(\"Consent, consent, consent,\" rolled the echo.)\n\n\"And then the _second_ item of business is to _welcome_ and bring to\ngrace these two newly _found_ and adopted _souls_.\"\n\nThe congregation shouted variously: \"Bring them to grace! Save them\nfrom the imps! Keep Orphalese from the taint of the beast!\"\n\nEvidently Guy was satisfied. He nodded and became more chatty. \"Okay,\npeople of Orphalese, let's get down to it. We got two new ones, like I\nsay. Their spirits have gone wandering on the wind, or anyway one of\nthem has, and you all know the et cetera. They have committed a wrong\nunto others and therefore unto themselves. Herself, I mean. Course, the\nother one could have a flame spirit in him too.\" He stared severely at\nChandler. \"Boys, keep an eye on him, why don't you?\" he said to two\nmen in the front row, surrendering his gun. \"Meggie, you tell about the\nfemale one.\"\n\nThe teen-aged girl stepped forward and said, in a conversational tone\nbut with modest pride, \"People of Orph'lese, well, I was walking down\nthe cut and I heard this car coming. Well, I was pretty surprised, you\nknow. I had to figure what to do. You all know what the trouble is with\ncars.\"\n\n\"The imps!\" cried a woman of forty with a face like a catfish.\n\nThe girl nodded. \"Most prob'ly. Well, I--I mean, people of Orph'lese,\nwell, I was by the switchback where we keep the chevvy-freeze hid, so I\njust waited till I saw it slowing down for the curve--me out of sight,\nyou know--and I rolled the chevvy-freeze out nice and it caught the\nwheels. Right over!\" she cried gleefully. \"Off the shoulder, people of\nOrph'lese, and into the ditch and over, and I didn't give it a chance\nto burn. I cut the switch and I had her! I put a knife into her back,\njust a little, about a quarter of an inch, maybe. Her pain was the\nbreakin' of the shell that enclosed her understanding, like it says.\nI figured she was all right then because she yelled but I brought her\nalong that way. Then Guy took care of her until we got the synod. Oh,\"\nshe remembered, \"and her tongue staggered a little without purpose\nwhile he was putting it on, didn't it, Guy?\" The bearded man nodded,\ngrinning, and lifted up the girl's foot. Incredulously, Chandler saw\nthat it was bound tight with a three-foot length of barbed wire, wound\nand twisted like a tourniquet, the blood black and congealed around it.\nHe lifted his shocked eyes to meet the girl's. She only looked at him,\nwith pity and understanding.\n\nGuy patted the foot and let it go. \"I didn't have any more C-clamps,\npeople of Orphalese,\" he apologized, \"but it looks all right at that.\nWell, let's see. We got to make up our minds about these two, I\nguess--no, wait!\" He held up his hand as a murmur began. \"First thing\nis, we ought to read a verse or two.\"\n\nHe opened a purple-bound volume at random, stared at a page for a\nmoment, moving his lips, and then read:\n\n\"Some of you say, 'It is the north wind who has woven the clothes we\nwear.'\n\n\"And I say, Ay, it was the north wind, but shame was his loom, and the\nsoftening of the sinews was his thread.\n\n\"And when his work was done he laughed in the forest.\"\n\nGently he closed the book, looking thoughtfully at the wall at the back\nof the room. He scratched his head. \"Well, people of Orphalese,\" he\nsaid slowly \"they're laughing in the forest all right, I guarantee, but\nwe've got one here that may be honest in the flesh, probably is, though\nshe was a thief in the spirit. Right? Well, do we take her in or reject\nher, O people of Orphalese?\"\n\nThe audience muttered to itself and then began to call out: \"Accept!\nOh, bring in the brand! Accept and drive out the imp!\"\n\n\"Fine,\" said the teen-ager, rubbing her hands and looking at the\nbearded man. \"Guy, let her go.\" He began to release her from the chair.\n\"You, girl stranger, what's your name?\"\n\nThe girl said faintly, \"Ellen Braisted.\"\n\n\"'_Meggie_, my name is Ellen Braisted,'\" corrected the teen-ager.\n\"Always say the name of the person you're talkin' to in Orph'lese, that\nway we know it's you talkin', not a flame spirit or wanderer. Okay, go\nsit down.\" Ellen limped wordlessly down into the audience. \"Oh, and\npeople of Orph'lese,\" said Meggie, \"the car's still there if we need it\nfor anything. It didn't burn. Guy, you go on with this other fellow.\"\n\nGuy stroked his beard and assessed Chandler, looking him over\ncarefully. \"Okay,\" he said. \"People of Orphalese, the _third_ order of\nbusiness is to _welcome_ or reject this _other_ brand saved from the\nimps, as may be your _pleasure_.\" Chandler sat up straighter now that\nall of them were looking at him again; but it wasn't quite his turn, at\nthat, because there was an interruption. Guy never finished. From the\nvalley, far below, there was a sudden mighty thunder, rolling among the\nmountains. The windows blew in with a crystalline crash.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe room erupted into confusion, the audience leaping from their seats,\nrunning to the broad windows, Guy and the teen-age girl seizing rifles,\neveryone in motion at once.\n\nChandler straightened, then sat down again. The red-headed man guarding\nhim was looking away. It would be quite possible to grab his gun, run,\nget away from these maniacs. Yet he had nowhere to go. They might be\ncrazy, but they seemed to have organization.\n\nThey seemed, in fact, to have worked out, on whatever crazed foundation\nof philosophy, some practical methods for coping with possession. He\ndecided to stay, wait and see.\n\nAnd at once he found himself leaping for the gun.\n\nNo. Chandler didn't find himself attacking the red-headed man. He\nfound his _body_ doing it; Chandler had nothing to do with it. It was\nthe helpless compulsion he had felt before, that had nearly cost him\nhis life; his body active and urgent and his mind completely cut off\nfrom it. He felt his own muscles move in ways he had not planned,\nobserved himself leap forward, felt his own fist strike at the back of\nthe red-headed man's ear. The man went spinning, the gun went flying,\nChandler's body leaped after it, with Chandler a prisoner in his own\nbrain, watching, horrified and helpless. And he had the gun!\n\nHe caught it in the hand that was his own hand, though someone else\nwas moving it; he raised it and half-turned. He was suddenly conscious\nof a fusillade of gunfire from the roof, and a scattered echo of guns\nall round the outside of the house. Part of him was surprised, another\nalien part was not. He started to shoot the teen-aged girl in the back\nof the head, silently shouting _No!_\n\nHis fingers never pulled the trigger.\n\nHe caught a second's glimpse of someone just beside him, whirled and\nsaw the girl, Ellen Braisted, limping swiftly toward him with her\nbarbed-wire amulet loose and catching at her feet. In her hands was\nan axe-handle club caught up from somewhere. She struck at Chandler's\nhead, with a face like an eagle's, impersonal and determined. The blow\ncaught him and dazed him, and from behind someone else struck him with\nsomething else. He went down.\n\nHe heard shouts and firing, but he was stunned. He felt himself dragged\nand dropped. He saw a cloudy, misty girl's face hanging over him; it\nreceded and returned. Then a frightful blistering pain in his hand\nstartled him back into full consciousness.\n\nIt was the girl, Ellen, still there, leaning over him and, oddly,\nweeping. And the pain in his hand was the burning flame of a kitchen\nmatch. Ellen was doing it, his wrist in one hand, a burning match held\nto it with the other.\n\n\nIV\n\nChandler yelled hoarsely, jerking his hand away.\n\nShe dropped the match and jumped up, stepping on the flame and watching\nhim. She had a butcher knife that had been caught between her elbow\nand her body while she burned him. Now she put her hand on the knife,\nwaiting. \"Does it hurt?\" she demanded tautly.\n\nChandler howled, with incredulity and rage: \"God damn it, yes! What did\nyou expect?\"\n\n\"I expected it to hurt,\" she agreed. She watched him for a moment more\nand then, for the first time since he had seen her, she smiled. It was\na small smile, but a beginning. A fusillade of shots from outside\nwiped it away at once. \"Sorry,\" she said. \"I had to do that. Please\ntrust me.\"\n\n\"_Why_ did you have to burn my hand?\"\n\n\"House rules,\" she said. \"Keeps the flame-spirits out, you know. They\ncan't stand pain.\" She took her hand off the knife warily, \"it still\nhurts, doesn't it?\"\n\n\"It still does, yes,\" nodded Chandler bitterly, and she lost interest\nin him and got up, looking about the room. Three of the Orphalese were\ndead, or seemed to be from the casual poses in which they lay draped\nacross a chair on the floor. Some of the others might have been freshly\nwounded, though it was hard to tell the casualties from the others in\nview of the Orphalese custom of self-inflicted pain. There was still\nfiring going on outside and overhead, and a shooting-gallery smell of\nburnt powder in the air. The girl, Ellen Braisted, limped back with\nthe butcher knife held carelessly in one hand. She was followed by the\nteen-ager, who wore a smile of triumph--and, Chandler noticed for the\nfirst time, a sort of tourniquet of barbed-wire on her left forearm,\nthe flesh puffy red around it \"Whopped 'em,\" she said with glee, and\npointed a .22 rifle at Chandler.\n\nEllen Braisted said, \"Oh, he--_Meggie_, I mean, he's all right.\" She\npointed at his burned palm. Meg approached him with competent care,\nthe rifle resting on her good right forearm and aimed at him as she\nexamined his burn. She pursed her lips and looked at his face. \"All\nright, Ellen, I guess he's clean. But you want to burn 'em deeper'n\nthat. Never pays to go easy, just means we'll have to do something else\nto 'im tomorrow.\"\n\n\"The hell you will,\" thought Chandler, and all but said it; but reason\nstopped him. In Rome he would have to do Roman deeds. Besides, maybe\ntheir ideas worked. Besides, he had until tomorrow to make up his mind\nabout what he wanted to do.\n\n\"Ellen, show him around,\" ordered the teen-ager. \"I got no time myself.\nShoosh! Almost got us that time, Ellen. Got to be more careful, cause\nthe white-handed aren't clean, you know.\" She strutted away, the rifle\nat trail. She seemed to be enjoying herself very much.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe name of the girl in the barbed-wire bracelet was Ellen Braisted.\nShe came from Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, and Chandler's first wonder\nwas what she was doing nearly three thousand miles from home.\n\nNobody liked to travel much these days. One place was as bad as\nanother, except that in the place where you were known you could\nperhaps count on friends and as a stranger you were probable fair game\nanywhere else. Of course, there was one likely reason for travel.\n\nShe didn't like to talk about it, that was clear, but that was the\nreason. She had been possessed. When the teen-ager trapped her car the\nday before she had been the tool of another's will. She had had a dozen\nsub-machine guns in the trunk and she had meant to deliver them to a\nparty of hunters in a valley just south of McGuire's Mountain. Chandler\nsaid, with some effort, \"I must have been----\"\n\n\"_Ellen_, I must have been,\" she corrected.\n\n\"Ellen, I must have been possessed too, just now. When I grabbed the\ngun.\"\n\n\"Of course. First time?\"\n\nHe shook his head. For some reason the brand on his forehead began to\nthrob.\n\n\"Well, then you know. Look out here, now.\"\n\nThey were at the great pier windows that looked out over the valley.\nDown below was the river, an arc of the railroad tracks, the wooded\nmountainside he had scaled. \"Over there, Chandler.\" She was pointing to\nthe railroad bridge.\n\nWispy gray smoke drifted off southward toward the stream. The freight\ntrain Chandler had ridden on had been stopped, all that time, in the\nmiddle of the bridge. The explosion that blew out their windows had\noccurred when another train plowed into it--evidently at high speed. It\nseemed that one of the trains had carried some sort of chemicals. The\nbridge was a twisted mess.\n\n\"A diversion, Chandler,\" said Ellen Braisted. \"They wanted us looking\nthat way. Then they attacked from up the mountain.\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\nEllen looked surprised. \"The men that crashed the trains ... if they\n_are_ men. The ones who possessed me--and you--and the hunters. They\ndon't like these Orphalese, I think. Maybe they're a little afraid of\nthem. I think the Orphalese have a pretty good idea of how to fight\nthem.\"\n\nChandler felt a sudden flash of sensation along his nerves. For a\nmoment he thought he had been possessed again, and then he knew it for\nwhat it was. It was hope. \"Ellen, I never thought of fighting them. I\nthought that was given up two years ago.\"\n\n\"So maybe you agree with me? Maybe you think it's worth while sticking\nwith the Orphalese?\"\n\nChandler allowed himself the contemplation of what hope meant. To find\nsomeone in this world who had a _plan_! Whatever the plan was. Even if\nit was a bad plan. He didn't think specifically of himself, or the\nbrand on his forehead or the memory of the body of his wife. What he\nthought of was the prospect of thwarting--not even defeating, merely\nhampering or annoying was enough!--the imps, the \"flame creatures,\"\nthe pythons, devils, incubi or demons who had destroyed a world he had\nthought very fair.\n\n\"If they'll have me,\" he said, \"I'll stick with them, all right! Where\ndo I go to join?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was not hard to join at all. Meg chattily informed him that he was\nalready practically a member. \"Chandler, we got to watch everybody\nstrange, you know. See why, don't you? Might have a flame spirit in\n'em, no fault of theirs, but look how they could mess us up. But now we\nknow you don't, so--What do you mean, how do we know? Cause you _did_\nhave one when you busted loose in there. Can't have two at a time, you\nknow. Think we couldn't tell the difference?\"\n\nThe interrupted meeting was resumed after the place had been tidied\nup and the dead buried. There had been four of the hunters, and even\nwithout their sub-machine guns they had succeeded in killing eight\nOrphalese. But it was not all loss to the Orphalese, because two of the\nhunters were still alive, though wounded, and under the rules of this\nchessboard the captured enemy became a friend.\n\nGuy had suffered a broken jaw in the scuffle and another man presided,\na fat youth who favored a bandaged leg. He limped to his feet,\ngrimacing and patting his leg. \"O Orphalese and brothers,\" he said, \"we\nhave lost friends, but we have won a test. Praise the Prophet, we will\nbe spared to win again, and to drive the imps of fire out of our world.\nMeggie, you going to tie these folks up?\" The girl proudly ordered\none of the hunters into the spotlighted dentist's chair, another\ninto a wing chair that was hastily moved onto the platform. The men\nwere bleeding and hurt, but they had clearly been abandoned by their\npossessors. They watched with puzzlement and fear.\n\n\"Walter, they're okay now,\" Meg reported as others finished tying up\nthe hunters. \"Oh, wait a minute.\" She advanced on Chandler. \"Chandler,\nI'm sorry. You sit down there, hear?\"\n\nChandler suffered himself to be bound to a camp chair on the platform\nand Walter took a drink of wine and opened the ornate book that was\nbefore him on the rostrum.\n\n\"Meg, thanks. Guy, I hope I do this as good as you do. Let me read you\na little. Let's see.\" He put on his steel-rimmed glasses and read:\n\n\"Much in you is still man, and much in you is not yet man, but a\nshapeless pigmy that walks asleep in the mist searching for its own\nawakening.\"\n\nHe closed the book, looked with satisfaction at Guy and said: \"Do you\nunderstand that, new friends? They are the words of the Prophet, who\nmen call Kahlil Gibran. For the benefit of the new folks I ought to say\nthat he died this fleshly life quite a good number of years ago, but\nhis vision was unclouded. Like we say, we are the sinews that batter\nthe flame spirits but he is our soul.\" There was an antiphonal murmur\nfrom the audience and Walter flipped the pages again rapidly, obviously\nlooking for a familiar passage. \"People of Orphalese, here we are now.\nThis's what he says. What is this that has torn our world apart? The\nProphet says: 'It is life in quest of life, in bodies that fear the\ngrave.' Now, honestly, nothing could be clearer than that, people of\nOrphalese and friends! We got something taking possession of us, see?\nWhat is it? Well, he says here, people of Orphalese and friends, 'It\nis a flame spirit in you ever gathering more of itself.' Now, what the\nheck! Nobody can blame _us_ for what a flame spirit _in_ us does! So\nthe first thing we got to learn, friends--and people of Orphalese--is,\nwe aren't to blame. And the second thing is, we _are_ to blame!\"\n\nHe turned and grinned at Chandler kindly, while the chorus of\nresponses came from the room, \"Like here,\" he said, \"people of\nOrphalese, the Prophet says _everybody_ is guilty. 'The murdered is\nnot unaccountable for his own murder, and the robbed is not blameless\nin being robbed. The righteous is not innocent of the deeds of the\nwicked, and the white-handed is not clean in the doings of the felon.'\nYou see what he's getting at? We all got to take the responsibility\nfor _everything_--and that means we got to suffer--but we don't have\nto worry about any special things we did when some flame spirit or\nwanderer, like, took us over.\n\n\"But we do have to suffer, people of Orphalese.\" His expression became\ngrim. \"Our beloved founder, Guy, who's sitting there doing a little\nextra suffering now, was favored enough to understand these things in\nthe very beginning, when he himself was seized by these imps. And it is\nall in this book! Like it says, 'Your pain is self-chosen. It is the\nbitter potion by which the physician within you heals your sick self.'\nPonder on that, people of Orphalese--and friends. No, I mean really\nponder,\" he explained, glancing at the bound \"friends\" on the platform.\n\"We always do that for a minute. Ada there will play us some music so\nwe can ponder.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nChandler shifted uncomfortably, while an old woman crippled by\narthritis began fumbling a tune out of an electric organ. The burn\nEllen Braisted had given him was beginning to hurt badly. If only these\npeople were not such obvious _nuts_, he thought, he would feel a lot\nbetter about casting his lot in with them. But maybe it took lunatics\nto do the job. Sane people hadn't accomplished much.\n\nAnd anyway he had very little choice....\n\n\"Ada, that's enough,\" ordered the fat youth. \"Meg, come on up here.\nPeople of Orphalese, now you can listen again while Meg explains to the\nnew folks how all this got started, seeing Guy's in no condition to do\nit.\"\n\nThe teen-ager marched up to the platform and took the parade-rest\nposition learned in some high-school debating society--in the days when\nthere were debating societies and high schools. \"Ladies and gentlemen,\nwell, let's start at the beginning. Guy tells this better'n I do,\nof course, but I guess I remember it all pretty well too. I ought\nto. I was in on it and all.\" She grimaced and said, \"Well, anyway,\nladies and gentlemen--people of Orph'lese--the way Guy organized\nthis Orphalese self-protection society was, like Walter says, he was\npossessed. The only difference between Guy and you and me was that he\nknew what to do about it, because he read the book, you see. Not that\nthat helped him at first, when he was took over. He was really seized.\nYes, people of Orph'lese, he was taken and while his whole soul and\nbrain and body was under the influence of some foul wanderer fiend\nfrom hell he did things that, ladies and gentlemen of Orph'lese, I\nwouldn't want to tell you. He was a harp in the hand of the mighty, as\nit says. Couldn't help it, not however much he tried. Only while he\nwas doing--the things--he happened to catch his hand in a gas flame\nand, well, you can see it was pretty bad.\" With a deprecatory smile Guy\nheld up a twisted hand. \"And, do you know, he was free of his imp right\nthen and there! Now, Guy is a scientist, people of Orph'lese, he worked\nfor the telephone company, and he not only had that training in the\ncompany school but he had read the book, you see, and he put two and\ntwo together. Oh, and he's my uncle, of course. I'm proud of him. I've\nalways loved him, and even when he--when he was not one with himself,\nyou know, when he was doing those terrible things to me, I knew it\nwasn't Uncle Guy that was doing them, but something else. I didn't know\nwhat, though. And when he told me he had figured out the Basic Rule,\nI went along with him every bit. I knew Guy wasn't wrong, and what he\nsaid was from Scripture. Imps fear pain! So we got to love it. That one\nI know by heart, all right: 'Could you keep your heart from wonder at\nthe daily miracles of your life, your pain would not seem less wondrous\nthan your joy.' That's what it says, right? So that's why we got to\nhurt ourselves, people of Orph'lese--and new brothers--because the\nwanderers don't like it when we hurt and they leave us alone. Simple's\nthat.\n\n\"Well--\" the girl's face stiffened momentarily--\"I knew _I_ wasn't\ngoing to be seized. So Guy and I got Else, that's the other girl he'd\nbeen doing things to, and we knew she wasn't going to be taken either.\nNot if the imps feared pain like Guy said, because,\" she said solemnly,\n\"I want to tell you Guy hurt us pretty bad.\n\n\"And then we came out here, and found this place, and ever since then\nwe've been adding brothers and sisters. It's been slow, of course,\nbecause not many people come this way any more, and we've had to kill\na lot. Yes, we have. Sometimes the possessed just can't be saved, but--\"\n\nAbruptly her face changed.\n\nSuddenly alert, her face years older, she glanced around the room. Then\nshe relaxed....\n\nAnd screamed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGuy leaped up. Hoarsely, his voice almost inarticulate as he tried to\ntalk with his broken jaw, he cried, \"Wha ... Wha's ... _matter_, Meg?\n\n\"Uncle Guy!\" she wailed. She plunged off the platform and flung herself\ninto his arms, crying hysterically.\n\n\"_Wha?_\"\n\nShe sobbed, \"I could feel it! They _took_ me. Guy, you promised me they\ncouldn't!\"\n\nHe shook his head, dazed, staring at her as though she were indeed\npossessed--still possessed, and telling him some fearful great lie to\ndestroy his hopes. He seemed unable to comprehend what she had said.\nOne of the hunters bellowed in stark fear: \"For God's sake, untie\nus! Give us a chance, anyway!\" Chandler yelled agreement. In one\nsplit second everyone in the room had been transmuted by terror into\nsomething less than human. No one seemed capable of any action. Slowly\nthe plump youth who had presided moved over to the hunter bound in\nthe dentist's chair and began to fumble blindly at the knots. Ellen\nBraisted dropped her head into her hands and began to shake.\n\nThe cruelty of the moment was that they had all tasted hope. Chandler\nwrithed wildly against his ropes, his mind racing out of control. The\nworld had become a hell for everyone, but a bearable hell until the\npromise of a chance to end it gave them a full sight of what their\nlives had been. Now that that was dashed they were far worse off than\nbefore.\n\nWalter finished with the hunter and lethargically began to pick at\nChandler's bonds. His face was slack and unseeing.\n\nThen it, too, changed.\n\nThe plump youth stood up sharply, glanced about, and walked off the\nplatform.\n\nEllen Braisted raised her face from her hands and, her eyes streaming,\nquietly stood up and followed. The old lady with the arthritis\nabout-faced and limped with them. Chandler stared, puzzled, and then\ncomprehended.\n\nThey were marching toward the corner of the room where the rifles were\nstacked. \"Possessed!\" Chandler bellowed, the words tasting of acid as\nthey ripped out of his throat. \"Stop them! You--Guy--look!\" He flailed\nwildly at his loosened bonds, lunged, tottered and toppled, chair and\nall, crashingly off the platform.\n\nThe three possessed ones did not need to hurry. They had all the time\nin the world. They were already reaching out for the rifles when\nChandler shouted. Economically they turned, raising the butts to\ntheir shoulders, and began to fire at the Orphalese. It was a queerly\nfrightening sight to see the arthritic organist, with a face like a\nrelaxed executioner, take quick aim at Guy and, with a thirty-thirty\nshell, blow his throat out. Three shots, and the nearest three of the\ncongregation were dead. Three more, and others went down, while the\nremainder turned and tried to run. It was like a slaughter of vermin.\nThey never had a chance.\n\nWhen every Orphalese except themselves was down on the floor, dead,\nwounded or, like Chandler, overlooked, the arthritic lady took careful\naim at Ellen Braisted and the plump youth and shot them neatly in the\ntemples. They didn't try to prevent her. With expressions that seemed\nalmost impatient they presented their profiles to her aim.\n\nThen the arthritic lady glanced leisurely about, fired into the\nstomach of a wounded man who was trying to rise, reloaded her rifle\nfor insurance and began to search the bodies of the nearest dead. She\nwas looking for matches. When she found them, she tugged weakly at the\nupholstery on a couch, swore and began methodically to rip and crumple\npages out of Kahlil Gibran. When she had a heap of loose papers piled\nagainst the dais she pitched the remainder of the book out of the\nwindow, knelt and ignited the crumpled heap.\n\nShe stood watching the fire, her expression angry and impatient,\ntapping her foot.\n\nThe crumpled pages burned briskly. Before they died the wooden dais was\nbeginning to catch. Laboriously the old lady toted folding chairs to\npile on the blaze until it was roaring handsomely.\n\nShe watched it for several minutes, until it was a great orange pillar\nof fire sweeping to the ceiling, until the drapes on the wall behind\nwere burning and the platform was a holocaust, until the noise of\ncrackling flame and the beginning of plaster falling from the high\nceiling proved that there was no likelihood of the fire going out\nand, indeed, no way to put it out without a complete fire department\narriving on the scene at once.\n\nThe old lady's expression cleared. She nodded to herself. She then\nput the muzzle of the rifle in her mouth and, with her thumb, pulled\nthe trigger that blew the top of her head off. The body fell into the\nflames, but it was by then already dead.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nChandler had not been shot, but he was very near to roasting. Walter\nhad released one hand and, while the possessed woman's attention was\nelsewhere, Chandler had worked on the other knots.\n\nWhen he saw her commit suicide he redoubled his efforts. It was\nincredible to him that his life had been saved, and he knew that if he\nescaped the flames he still had nothing to live for--that blasted brief\nhope had broken his spirit--but his fingers had a will of their own.\n\nHe lay there, struggling, while great black clouds of smoke, orange\npainted from the flames, gathered under the high ceiling, while the\nthunder of falling lumps of plaster sounded like a child heaving\nvolumes of the Encyclopedia Britannica down a flight of stairs, while\nthe heat and shortage of oxygen made him breathe in violent spasms.\nThen he cried out sharply and stumbled to his feet. It was only a\nmatter of moments before he was out of the house, but it was very\nnearly not time enough.\n\nBehind him was a great, sustained crash. He thought it must have been\nthe furniture on the upper floor toppling through the burned-out\nceiling of the hall. He turned and looked.\n\nIt was dark, and now every window on the side of the house facing him\nwas lighted. It was as though some mad householder had decided to equip\nhis rooms only with orange lights, orange lights that flickered and\nmoved. For a second Chandler thought there were still living people in\nthe rooms--shapes moved and cavorted at the windows, as though they\nwere gathering up possessions or waving wildly for help. But it was\nonly the drapes, aflame, tossed about in the fierce heat.\n\nChandler sighed and turned away.\n\nPain was not a sure defense after all. Evidently it was only an\nannoyance to the possessors ... whoever, or whatever, they might be.\nAs soon as they had become suspicious they had exerted themselves and\ndestroyed the Orphalese. He listened and looked about, but no one else\nmoved. He had not expected anyone. He had been sure that he was the\nonly survivor.\n\nHe began to walk down the hill toward the wrecked railway bridge,\nturning only when a roar told him that the roof of the house had fallen\nin. A tulip of flame a hundred feet tall rose above the standing walls,\nand above that a shower of floating red-orange sparks, heat-borne,\ndrifting up and away and beginning to settle all over the mountainside.\nMany were still red when they landed, a few still flaming. It was a\ndistinct risk that the trees would begin to burn, and then he would be\nin fresh danger. So great was his stupor that he did not even hurry.\n\nBy a plowed field he flung himself to the ground.\n\nHe could go no farther because he had nowhere to go. He had had two\nhomes and he had been driven from both of them. He had had hope twice,\nand twice he had been damned.\n\nHe lay on his back, with the burning house mumbling and crackling in\nthe distance, and stared up at the orange-lit tops of the trees and,\npast them, the stars. Over his left shoulder Deneb chased Vega across\nthe sky; toward his feet something moved between the bright rosy dot\nthat was Antares and another, the same brightness and hue--Mars? He\nspent several moments wondering if Mars were in that part of the\nheavens. Then he looked again for the tiny moving point that had\ncrossed the claws of the Scorpion, but it was gone. A satellite, maybe.\nAlthough there were few of them left that the naked eye could hope to\nsee. And there would never be any more, because the sort of accumulated\nwealth of nations that threw rockets into the sky was forever spent.\n\nIt was probably an airplane, he thought drowsily, and drifted off to\nsleep without realizing how remote even that possibility had become....\nHe woke up to find that he was getting to his feet.\n\nOnce again an interloper tenanted his brain. He tried to interfere, for\nhe could not help it, although he knew how useless it was, but his own\nneck muscles turned his head from side to side, his own eyes looked\nthis way and that, his own hand reached down for a dead branch that lay\non the ground, then hesitated and withdrew. His body stood motionless\nfor a second, the lips moving, the larynx mumbling to itself. He could\nalmost hear words. Chandler felt like a fly in amber, prisoned in his\nown brainbox. He was not surprised when his legs moved to carry him\nback toward the destroyed building, now a fakir's bed of white-hot\ncoals with brush fires spattered around it. He thought he knew why. It\nseemed very likely that what possessor had him was a sort of clean-up\nsquad, tidying up the loose ends of the slaughter; he expected that his\nbody's errand was to destroy itself, and thus him, as all the Orphalese\nhad been destroyed.\n\n\nV\n\nChandler's body carried him rapidly toward the house. Now and then it\npaused and glanced about. It seemed to be weighing some shortcut in\nits errand; but always it resumed its climb.\n\nChandler could sympathize with it, in a way. He still felt every\npain from burn, brand and wound; as they neared the embers of the\nbuilding the heat it threw off intensified them all. He could not be a\ncomfortable body to inhabit for long. He was almost sympathetic because\nhis tenant could not find a convenient weapon with which to fulfill his\npurpose.\n\nWhen it seemed they could get no closer without the skin of his face\ncrackling and bursting into flame his body halted.\n\nChandler could feel his muscles gathering for what would be the final\nleap into the auto-da-fe. His feet took a short step--and slipped.\nHis body stumbled and recovered itself; his mouth swore thickly in a\nlanguage he did not know.\n\nThen his body hesitated, glanced at the ground, paused again and bent\ndown. It had tripped on a book. It picked the book up, and Chandler saw\nthat it was the Orphalese copy of Gibran's _The Prophet_.\n\nChandler's body stood poised for a moment, in an attitude of thought.\nThen it sat down, in the play of heat from the coals. It was a moment\nbefore Chandler realized he was free. He tested his legs; they worked;\nhe got up, turned and began to walk away.\n\nHe had traveled no more than a few yards when he stumbled slightly, as\nthough shifting gears, and felt the tenant in his mind again.\n\nHe continued to walk away from the building, down toward the road. Once\nhis arm raised the book he still carried and his eyes glanced down, as\nif for reassurance that it was the same book. That was the only clue he\nwas given as to what had happened and it was not much. It was as though\nhis occupying power, whatever it was, had gone--somewhere--to think\nthings over, perhaps to ask a question of an unimaginable companion,\nand then returned with an altered purpose. As time passed, Chandler\nbegan to receive additional clues, but he was in little shape to fit\nthem together, for his body was near exhaustion.\n\nHe walked to the road, and waited, rigid, until a panel truck came\nbouncing along. He hailed it, his arms making a sign he did not\nunderstand, and when it stopped he addressed the driver in a language\nhe did not speak. \"_Shto_,\" said the driver, a somber-faced Mexican in\ndungarees. \"_Ja nie jestem Ruska. Czego pragniesh?_\"\n\n\"_Czy ty jedziesz to_ Los Angeles?\" asked Chandler's mouth.\n\n\"_Nyet. Acapulco._\"\n\nChandler's voice argued, \"_Wes na_ Los Angeles.\"\n\n\"_Nyet._\" The voices droned on. Chandler lost interest in the argument\nand was only relieved when it seemed somehow to be settled and he was\nherded into the back of the truck. The somber Mexican locked him in; he\nfelt the truck begin to move; his tenant left him, and he was at once\nasleep.\n\nHe woke long enough to find himself standing in the mist of early dawn\nat a crossroads. In a few minutes another car came by, and his voice\ntalked earnestly with the driver for a moment. Chandler got in, was\nreleased, slept again and woke to find himself free and abandoned,\nsprawled across the back seat of the car, which was parked in front of\na building marked Los Angeles International Airport.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nChandler got out of the car and strolled around, stretching. He\nrealized he was very hungry.\n\nNo one was in sight. The field showed clear signs of having been\nthrough the same sort of destruction that had visited every major\ncommunications facility in the world. Part of the building before\nhim was smashed flat and showed signs of having been burned. He saw\nprojecting aluminum members, twisted and scorched but still visibly\naircraft parts. Apparently a transport had crashed into the building.\nBurned-out cars littered the parking lot and what had once been a green\nlawn. They seemed to have been bulldozed out of the way, but not an\ninch farther than was necessary to clear the approach roads.\n\nTo his right, as he stared out onto the field, was a strange-looking\nconstruction on three legs, several stories high. It did not seem\nto serve any useful purpose. Perhaps it had been a sort of luxury\nrestaurant at one time, like the Space Needle from the old Seattle\nFair, but now it too was burned out and glassless in its windows. The\nfield itself was swept bare except for two or three parked planes in\nthe bays, but he could see wrecked transports lining the approach\nstrips. All in all, Los Angeles International Airport appeared to be\nserviceable, but only just.\n\nHe wondered where all the people were.\n\nDistant truck noises answered part of the question. An Army six by six\ncame bumping across a bridge that led from the takeoff strips to this\nparking area of the airport. Five men got out next to one of the ships.\nThey glanced at him but did not speak as they began loading crates of\nsome sort of goods from the truck into the aircraft, a four-engine,\nswept-wing jet of what looked to Chandler like an obsolete model.\nPerhaps it was one of the early Boeings. There hadn't been many of\nthose in use at the time the troubles began, too big and fast for short\nhops, too slow to compete over long distances with the rockets. But, of\ncourse, with all the destruction, and with no new aircraft being built\nanywhere in the world any more, no doubt they were as good as could be\nfound.\n\nThe truckmen did not seem to be possessed; they worked with the\nnormal amount of grunting and swearing, pausing to wipe sweat away\nor to scratch an itch. They showed neither the intense malevolent\nconcentration nor the wide-eyed idiot curiosity of those whose bodies\nwere no longer their own. Chandler settled the woolen cap over the\nbrand on his forehead, to avoid unpleasantness, and drifted over toward\nthem.\n\nThey stopped work and regarded him. One of them said something to\nanother, who nodded and walked toward Chandler. \"What do you want?\" he\ndemanded warily.\n\n\"I don't know. I was going to ask you the same question, I guess.\"\n\nThe man scowled. \"Didn't your exec tell you what to do?\"\n\n\"My what?\"\n\nThe man paused, scratched and shook his head. \"Well, stay away from us.\nThis is an important shipment, see? I guess you're all right or you\ncouldn't've got past the guards, but I don't want you messing us up.\nGot enough trouble already. I don't know why,\" he said in the tones\nof an old grievance, \"we can't get the execs to let us _know_ when\nthey're going to bring somebody in. It wouldn't hurt them! Now here we\ngot to load and fuel this ship and, for all I know, you've got half a\nton of junk around somewhere that you're going to load onto it. How do\nI know how much fuel it'll take? No weather, naturally. So if there's\nheadwinds it'll take full tanks, but if there's extra cargo I--\"\n\n\"The only cargo I brought with me that I can think of is a book,\" said\nChandler. \"Weighs maybe a pound. You think I'm supposed to get on that\nplane?\"\n\nThe man grunted non-committally.\n\n\"All right, suit yourself. Listen, is there any place I can get\nsomething to eat?\"\n\nThe man considered. \"Well, I guess we can spare you a sandwich. But you\nwait here. I'll bring it to you.\"\n\nHe went back to the truck. A moment later one of the others brought\nChandler two cold hamburgers wrapped in waxed paper, but would answer\nno questions.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nChandler ate every crumb, sought and found a washroom in the wrecked\nbuilding, came out again and sat in the sun, watching the loading crew.\nHe had become quite a fatalist. It did not seem that it was intended he\nshould die immediately, so he might as well live.\n\nThere were large gaps in his understanding, but it seemed clear to\nChandler that these men, though not possessed, were in some way working\nfor the possessors. It was a distasteful concept; but on second thought\nit had reassuring elements. It was evidence that whatever the \"execs\"\nwere, they were very possibly human beings--or, if not precisely human,\nat least shared the human trait of working by some sort of organized\neffort toward some sort of a goal. It was the first non-random\nphenomenon he had seen in connection with the possessors, barring the\nshort-term tactical matters of mass slaughter and destruction. It made\nhim feel--what he tried at once to suppress, for he feared another\ndestroying frustration--a touch of hope.\n\nThe men finished their work but did not leave. Nor did they approach\nChandler, but sat in the shade of their truck, waiting for something.\nHe drowsed and was awakened by a distant sputter of a single-engined\nAerocoupe that hopped across the building behind him, turned sharply\nand came down with a brisk little run in the parking bay itself.\n\nFrom one side the pilot climbed down and from the other two men lifted,\nwith great care, a wooden crate, small but apparently heavy. They\nstowed it in the jet while the pilot stood watching; then the pilot and\none of the other men got into the crew compartment. Chandler could not\nbe sure, but he had the impression that the truckman who entered the\nplane was no longer his own master. His movements seemed more sure and\nconfident, but above all it was the mute, angry eyes with which his\nfellows regarded him that gave Chandler grounds for suspicion. He had\nno time to worry about that; for in the same breath he felt himself\noccupied once more.\n\nHe did not rise. His own voice said to him, \"You. Votever you name, you\nfellow vit de book! You go get de book verever you pud it and get on\ndat ship dere, you see?\" His eyes turned toward the waiting aircraft.\n\"And don't forget de book!\"\n\nHe was released. \"I won't,\" he said automatically, and then realized\nthat there was no longer anyone there to hear his answer.\n\nWhen he retrieved the Gibran volume from the car and approached the\nplane the loading crew said nothing. Evidently they knew what he was\ndoing--either because they too had been given instructions, or because\nthey were used to such things. He paused at the wheeled stairs.\n\"Listen,\" he said, \"can you at least tell me where I'm going?\"\n\nThe four remaining men looked at him silently, with the same angry,\nworried expression he had seen on their faces before. They did not\nanswer, but after a moment one of them raised his arm and pointed.\n\nWest. Out toward the Pacific. Out toward some ten million square miles\nof nearly empty sea.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLong before they reached their destination Chandler had reasoned what\nit must be. He was correct: it was the islands of Hawaii.\n\nChandler knew that the pilot and his coopted partner were up forward,\nin the crew compartment, but the door was locked and he never saw them\nagain. Apart from them he was the only living person on the plane.\n\nThe plane was lightly loaded with cargo of unidentifiable sorts. In\nthe rear section, where once tourist-class passengers had eaten their\ncomplimentary tray meals and planned their vacations, the seats had\nbeen removed and a thin scatter of crates and boxes were strapped to\nthe floor. In the luxury of the forward section Chandler sat, stared at\nthe water and drowsed. He seemed to be always sleepy. Perhaps it was\nthe consequence of his exertions; more likely it was a psychological\nphenomenon. He was beyond worry. He had reached that point in emotional\nfatigue when the sudden rattle of cannonfire or the enemy's banzai\ncharge can no longer flood the blood with adrenalin. The glands are\ndry. The emotions have been triggered too often. Battle fatigue takes\nmen in many different ways, but in Chandler it was only apathy. He not\nonly could not worry, he could not even rouse himself to feel hunger,\nalthough the pricking of habit made him get up and search the flight\nkitchen, unsuccessfully, for food.\n\nHe had no idea how much time had passed when the hiss of the jets\nchanged key.\n\nThe horizon dipped below the wingtip and straightened again, and he\nbeheld land. He never saw the airfield, only water, then beach, then\nwater again, then a few buildings. Then there was a roar of jets, with\ntheir clamshells deflecting their thrust forward to brake their speed,\nand then the wheels were on the ground. As the plane stopped he felt\nhimself once more possessed. It was no longer terrifying--though\nChandler was sure he was doomed.\n\nWithout knowing where he was going or why he picked up the ripped book,\nopened the cabin exit and stepped down onto the rolling steps that had\nimmediately been brought into place. He was conscious of a horde of\nmen swarming around the plane, stripping it of its cargo, and wondered\nbriefly at the rush; but he could not stop to watch them, his legs\ncarried him swiftly across a paved strip to where a police car was\ncruising.\n\nChandler cringed inside, instinctively, but his body did not falter as\nit stepped into the path of the car and raised its hand.\n\nThe police car jammed on its brakes. The policeman at the wheel,\nChandler thought inside himself, looked startled, but he also looked\nresigned. \"To de South Gate, qvickly,\" said Chandler's lips, and he\nfelt his legs carry him around to the door on the other side.\n\nThere was another policeman on the seat next to the driver. He leaped\nlike a hare to get the door open and get out before Chandler's body got\nthere. He made it with nothing to spare. \"Jack, you go on, I'll tell\nHeadquarters,\" he said hurriedly. The driver nodded without speaking.\nHis lips were white. He reached over Chandler to close the door and\nmade a sharp U-turn.\n\nAs soon as the car was moving Chandler felt himself able to move his\nlips again.\n\n\"I,\" he said. \"I don't know--\"\n\n\"Friend,\" said the policeman, \"kindly keep your mouth shut. 'South\nGate,' the exec said, and South Gate is where I'm going.\"\n\nChandler shrugged and looked out the window ... just in time to see the\njet that had brought him to the islands once more lumbering into life.\nIt crept, wobbling its wingtips, over the ground, picked up speed,\nroared across taxi strips and over rough ground and at last piled up\nagainst an ungainly looking foreign airplane, a Russian jet by its\nmarkings, in a thunderous crash and ball of flame as its fuel exploded.\nNo one got out.\n\nIt seemed that traffic to Hawaii was all one way.\n\n\nVI\n\nThey roared through downtown Honolulu with the siren blaring and cars\nscattering out of the way. At seventy miles an hour they raced down a\nroad by the sea. Chandler caught a glimpse of a sign that said \"Hilo,\"\nbut where or what \"Hilo\" might be he had no idea. Soon there were fewer\ncars; then there were none but their own.\n\nThe road was a surburban highway lined with housing development,\nshopping centers, palm groves and the occasional center of a small\nmunicipality, scattering helterskelter together. There was a road like\nthis extending in every direction from every city in the United States,\nChandler thought; but this one was somewhat altered. Something had been\nthere before them. About a mile outside Honolulu's outer fringe, life\nwas cut off as with a knife. There were no people on foot, and the only\ncars were rusted wrecks lining the roads. The lawns were ragged stands\nof weeds in front of the ranch-type homes.\n\nIt was evidently not allowed to live here.\n\nChandler craned his neck. His curiosity was becoming almost unbearable.\nHe opened his mouth, but, \"I said, 'Shut up.'\" rumbled the cop without\nlooking at him. There was a note in the policeman's voice that\nimpressed Chandler. He did not quite know what it was, but it made him\nobey. They drove for another fifteen minutes in silence, then drew up\nbefore a barricade across the road.\n\nChandler got out. The policeman slammed the door behind him, ripping\nrubber off his tires with the speed of his U-turn and acceleration back\ntoward Honolulu. He did not look at Chandler.\n\nChandler stood staring off after him, in bright warm sunlight with a\nreek of hibiscus and rotting palms in his nostril. It was very quiet\nthere, except for a soft scratchy sound of footsteps on gravel. As\nChandler turned to face the man who was coming toward him, he realized\nhe had learned one fact from the policeman after all. The cop was\nscared clear through.\n\nChandler said, \"Hello,\" to the man who was approaching.\n\nHe too wore a uniform, but not that of the Honolulu city police. It\nwas like U.S. Army suntans, but without insignia. Behind him were\nhalf a dozen others in the same dress, smoking, chatting, leaning\nagainst whatever was handy. The barricades themselves were impressively\nthorough. Barbed wire ran down the beach and out into the ocean; on the\nother side of the road, barbed wire ran clear out of sight along the\nmiddle of a side road. The gate itself was bracketed with machine-gun\nemplacements.\n\nThe guard waited until he was close to Chandler before speaking. \"What\ndo you want?\" he asked without greeting. Chandler shrugged. \"All right,\njust wait here,\" said the guard, and began to walk away again.\n\n\"Wait a minute! What am I waiting for?\" The guard shook his head\nwithout stopping or turning. He did not seem very interested, and he\ncertainly was not helpful.\n\nChandler put down the copy of _The Prophet_ which he had carried so\nfar and sat on the ground, but again he had no long time to wait. One\nof the guards came toward him, with the purposeful movements Chandler\nhad learned to recognize. Without speaking the guard dug into a pocket.\nChandler jumped up instinctively, but it was only a set of car keys.\n\nAs Chandler took them the look in the guard's eyes showed the quick\nrelease of tension that meant he was free again; and in that same\nmoment Chandler's own body was occupied once more.\n\nHe reached down and picked up the book. Quickly, but a little clumsily,\nhis fingers selected a key, and his legs carried him toward a little\nFrench car parked just the other side of the barrier.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nChandler was learning at last the skills of allowing his body to have\nits own way. He couldn't help it in any event, so he was consciously\ndisciplining himself to withdraw his attention from his muscles and\nsenses. It involved queerly vertiginous problems. A hundred times a\nminute there was some unexpected body sway or movement of the hand,\nand his lagging, imprisoned mind would wrench at its unresponsive\nnerves to put out the elbow that would brace him or to catch itself\nwith a step. He had learned to ignore these things. The mind that\ninhabited his body had ways not his own of maintaining balance and\nreaching an objective, but they were equally sure.\n\nHe watched his own hands shifting the gears of the car. It was a make\nhe had never driven, with a clutchless drive he did not understand, but\nthe mind in his brain evidently understood it well enough. They picked\nup speed in great, gasoline-wasting surges.\n\nChandler began to form a picture of that mind. It belonged to an older\nman, from the hesitancy of its walk, and a testy one, from the heedless\ncrash of the gears as it shifted. It drove with careless slapdash\nspeed. Chandler's mind yelled and flinched in his brain as they rounded\nblind curves, where any casual other motorist would have been a\ncatastrophe; but the hand on the wheel and the foot on the accelerator\ndid not hesitate.\n\nBeyond the South Gate the island of Oahu became abruptly wild.\n\nThere were beautiful homes, but there were also great, gap-toothed\nspaces where homes had once been and were no longer. It seemed that\nsome monstrous Zoning Commissar had stalked through the island with\nan eraser, rubbing out the small homes, the cheap ones, the old ones;\nrubbing out the stores, rubbing out the factories. This whole section\nof the island had been turned into an exclusive residential park.\n\nIt was not uninhabited. Chandler thought he glimpsed a few people,\nthough since the direction of his eyes was not his to control it was\nhard to be sure. And then the Renault turned into a lane, paved but\nnarrow. Hardwood trees with some sort of blossoms, Chandler could not\ntell what, overhung it on both sides.\n\nIt meandered for a mile or so, turned and opened into a great vacant\nparking lot. The Renault stopped with a squeal of brakes in front of a\ndoor that was flanked by bronze plaques: _TWA Flight Message Center_.\n\nChandler caught sight of a skeletal towering form overhead, like\na radio transmitter antenna, as his body marched him inside, up a\nmotionless escalator, along a hall and into a room.\n\nHis muscles relaxed.\n\nHe glanced around and, from a huge couch beside a desk, a huge soft\nbody stirred and, gasping, sat up. It was a very fat old man, almost\nbald, wearing a coronet of silvery spikes.\n\nHe looked at Chandler without much interest. \"Vot's your name?\" he\nwheezed. He had a heavy, ineradicable accent, like a Hapsburg or a\nRussian diplomat. Chandler recognized it readily. He had heard it often\nenough, from his own lips.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe man's name was Koitska, he said in his accented wheeze. If he had\nanother name he did not waste it on Chandler. He took as few words as\npossible to order Chandler to be seated and to be still.\n\nKoitska squinted at the copy of Gibran's _The Prophet_. He did not\nglance at Chandler, but Chandler felt himself propelled out of his\nseat, to hand the book to Koitska, then returning. Koitska turned its\nremaining pages with an expression of bored repugnance, like a man\npicking off his arm. He seemed to be waiting for something.\n\nA door closed on the floor below, and in a moment a girl came into the\nroom.\n\nShe was tall, dark and not quite young. Chandler, struck by her beauty,\nwas sure that he had seen her, somewhere, but could not place her face.\nShe wore a coronet like the fat man's, intertwined in a complicated\nhairdo, and she got right down to business. \"Chandler, is it? All\nright, love, what we want to know is what this is all about.\" She\nindicated the book.\n\nA relief that was like pain crossed Chandler's mind. So that was why he\nwas here! Whoever these people were, however they managed to rule men's\nminds, they were not quite certain of their perfect power. To them the\nsad, futile Orphalese represented a sort of annoyance--not important\nenough to be a threat--but something which had proved inconvenient at\none time and therefore needed investigating. As Chandler was the only\nsurvivor they had deemed it worth their godlike whiles to transport him\nfour thousand miles so that he might satisfy their curiosity.\n\nChandler did not hesitate in telling them all about the people of\nOrphalese. There was nothing worth concealing, he was quite sure. No\ndebts are owed to the dead; and the Orphalese had proved on their own\nheads, at the last, that their ritual of pain was only an annoyance to\nthe possessors, not a tactic that could long be used against them.\n\nIt took hardly five minutes to say everything that needed saying about\nGuy, Meggie and the other doomed and suffering inhabitants of the old\nhouse on the mountain.\n\nKoitska hardly spoke. The girl was his interrogator, and sometimes\ntranslator as well, when his English was not sufficient to comprehend\na point. With patient detachment she kept the story moving until\nKoitska with a bored shrug indicated he was through.\n\nThen she smiled at Chandler and said, \"Thanks, love. Haven't I seen you\nsomewhere before?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I thought the same thing about you.\"\n\n\"Oh, everybody's seen me. Lots of me. But--well, no matter. Good luck,\nlove. Be nice to Koitska and perhaps he'll do as much for you.\" And she\nwas gone.\n\nKoitska lay unmoving on his couch for a few moments, rubbing a fat nose\nwith a plump finger. \"Hah,\" he said at last. Then, abruptly, \"And now,\nde qvestion is, vot to do vit you, eh? I do not t'ink you can cook, eh?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith unexpected clarity Chandler realized he was on trial for his life.\n\"Cook? No, I'm afraid not. I mean, I can boil eggs,\" he said. \"Nothing\nfancy.\"\n\n\"Hah,\" grumbled Koitska. \"Vel. Ve need a couple, three doctors, but I\ndo not t'ink you vould do.\"\n\nChandler shook his head. \"I'm an electrical engineer,\" he said. \"Or\nwas.\"\n\n\"Vas?\"\n\n\"I haven't had much practice. There has not been a great deal of call\nfor engineers, the last year or two.\"\n\n\"Hah.\" Koitska seemed to consider. \"Vel,\" he said, \"it could be ...\nyes, it could be dat ve have a job for you. You go back downstairs\nand--no, vait.\" The fat man closed his eyes and Chandler felt himself\nseized and propelled down the stairs to what had once been a bay of a\nbuilt-in garage. Now it was fitted up with workbenches and the gear of\na radio ham's dreams.\n\nChandler walked woodenly to one of the benches. His own voice spoke\nto him. \"Ve got here someplace--_da_, here is cirguit diagrams and de\nspecs for a sqvare-vave generator. You know vot dat is? Write down de\nanswer.\" Chandler, released with a pencil in his hand and a pad before\nhim, wrote _Yes_. \"Okay. Den you build vun for me. I areddy got vun but\nI vant another. You do dis in de city, not here. Go to Tripler, dey\ntells you dere vere you can work, vere to get parts, all dat. Couple\ndays you come out here again, I see if I like how you build.\"\n\nClutching the thick sheaf of diagrams, Chandler felt himself propelled\noutside and back into the little car. The interview was over.\n\nHe wondered if he would be able to find his way back to Honolulu, but\nthat problem was then postponed as he discovered he could not start the\ncar. His own hands had already done so, of course, but it had been so\nquick and sure that he had not paid attention; now he found that the\nignition key was marked only in French, which he could not speak. After\ntrial and error he discovered the combination that would start the\nengine and unlock the steering wheel, and then gingerly he toured the\nperimeter of the lot until he found an exit road.\n\nIt was close to midnight, he judged. Stars were shining overhead; there\nwas a rising moon. He then remembered, somewhat tardily, that he should\nnot be seeing stars. The lane he had come in on had been overhung on\nboth sides with trees.\n\nA few minutes later he realized he was quite lost.\n\nChandler stopped the car, swore feelingly, got out and looked around.\n\nThere was nothing much to see. The roads bore no markers that made\nsense to him. He shrugged and rummaged through the glove compartment\non the chance of a map; there was none, but he did find what he had\nalmost forgotten, a half-empty pack of cigarettes. It had been--he\ncounted--nearly a week since he had smoked. He lit up.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a pleasant evening, too. He felt almost relaxed. He stood there,\nwondering just what might be about to happen next--with curiosity more\nthan fear--and then he felt a light touch at his mind.\n\nIt was nothing, really. Or nothing that he could quite identify. It was\nthough he had been nudged. It seemed that someone was about to usurp\nhis body again, but that did not develop.\n\nAs he had about decided to forget it and get back in the car he saw\nheadlights approaching.\n\nA low, lean sports car slowed as it came near, stopping beside him, and\na girl leaned out, almost invisible in the darkness. \"There you are,\nlove,\" she said cheerfully. \"Thought I spotted someone. Lost?\"\n\nShe had a coronet, and Chandler recognized her. It was the girl who had\ninterrogated him. \"I guess I am,\" he admitted.\n\nThe girl leaned forward. \"Come in, dear. Oh, that thing? Leave it here,\nthe silly little bug.\" She giggled as they drove away from the Renault.\n\"Koitska wouldn't like you wandering around. I guess he decided to give\nyou a job?\"\n\n\"How did you know?\"\n\nShe said softly, \"Well, love, you're here, you know. Otherwise--never\nmind. What are you supposed to be doing?\"\n\n\"Going to Tripler, whatever that is. In Honolulu, I guess. Then I have\nto build some radio equipment.\"\n\n\"Tripler's actually on the other side of the city. I'll take you to the\ngate; then you tell them where you want to go. They'll take care of it.\"\n\n\"I don't have any money for fare.\"\n\nShe laughed. After a moment she said, \"Koitska's not the worst. But I'd\nmind my step if I were you, love. Do what he says, the best you can.\nYou never know. You might find yourself very fortunate....\"\n\n\"I already think that. I'm alive.\"\n\n\"Why, love, that point of view will take you far.\" The sports car slid\nsmoothly to a stop at the barricade and, in the floodlights above the\nmachine-gun nests, she looked more closely at Chandler. \"What's that on\nyour forehead, dear?\"\n\nSomehow the woolen cap had been lost. \"A brand,\" he said shortly. \"'H'\nfor 'hoaxer.' I did something when one of you people had me, and they\nthought I'd done it on my own.\"\n\n\"Why--why, this is wonderful!\" the girl said excitedly. \"No wonder I\nthought I'd seen you before. Don't you remember? I was in the forewoman\nat your trial!\"\n\n\nVII\n\nA pink and silver bus let Chandler off at Fort Street in downtown\nHonolulu and he walked a few blocks to the address he had been given.\nThe name of the place was Parts 'n Plenty. He found it easily enough.\nIt was a radio parts store; by the size of it, it had once been a big,\nwell-stocked one; but now the counters were almost bare.\n\nA thin-faced man with khaki-colored skin looked up and nodded. Chandler\nnodded back. He fingered a bin of tuning knobs, hefted a coil of\ntwo-strand antenna wire and said, \"A fellow at Tripler told me to come\nhere to pick up equipment, but I'm damned if I know what I'm supposed\nto do when I locate it. I don't have any money.\"\n\nThe dark-skinned man got up and came over to him. \"Figured you for a\nmainlander. No sweat. Have you got a list?\"\n\n\"I can make one.\"\n\n\"All right. Catalogues on the table behind you, if you want them.\" He\noffered Chandler a cigarette and sat against the edge of the counter,\nreading over Chandler's shoulder. \"Ho,\" he said suddenly. \"Koitska's\nsquare-wave generator again, right?\" Chandler admitted it, and the man\ngrinned. \"Every couple months he sends somebody along. He doesn't\nreally need the generator, you know. He just wants to see how much you\nknow about building it, Mr.--?\"\n\n\"Chandler.\"\n\n\"Glad to know you. I'm John Hsi. But don't go easy on the job just\nbecause it's a waste of time, Chandler; it could be pretty important to\nyou.\"\n\nChandler absorbed the information silently and handed over his list.\nThe man did not look at it. \"Come back in about an hour,\" he said.\n\n\"I won't have any money in an hour, either.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's all right. I'll put it on Koitska's bill.\"\n\nChandler said frankly, \"Look, I don't know what's going on. Suppose I\ncame in and picked up a thousand dollars' worth of stuff, would you put\nthat on the bill, too?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Hsi optimistically. \"You thinking about stealing\nthem? What would you do with them?\"\n\n\"Well....\" Chandler puffed on his cigarette. \"Well, I could--\"\n\n\"No, you couldn't. Also, it wouldn't pay, believe me,\" Hsi said\nseriously. \"If there is one thing that doesn't pay, it is cheating on\nthe Exec.\"\n\n\"Now, that's another good question,\" said Chandler. \"Who is the Exec?\"\n\nHsi shook his head. \"Sorry. I don't know you, Chandler.\"\n\n\"You mean you're afraid even to answer a question?\"\n\n\"You're damned well told I am. Probably nobody would mind what I might\ntell you ... but 'probably' isn't good enough.\"\n\nExasperated, Chandler said, \"How the devil am I supposed to know what\nto do next? So I take all this junk back to my room at Tripler and\nsolder up the generator--then what?\"\n\n\"Then Koitska will get in touch with you,\" Hsi said, not unkindly.\n\"Play it as it comes to you, Chandler, that's the best advice I can\noffer.\" He hesitated. \"Koitska's not the worst of them,\" he said; and\nthen, daringly, \"and maybe he's not the best, either. Just do whatever\nhe told you. Keep on doing it until he tells you to do something else.\nThat's all. I mean, that's all the advice I can give you. Whether it's\ngoing to be enough to satisfy Koitska is something else again.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere is not much to do in a strange town when you have no money.\nChandler's room at what once had been Tripler General Hospital was\nfree; the bus was free; evidently all the radio parts he could want\nwere also free. But he did not have the price of a cup of coffee or a\nhaircut in the pockets of the suntan slacks the desk man at Tripler\nhad issued him. He wandered around the streets of Honolulu, waiting for\nthe hour to be up.\n\nAt Tripler a doctor had also examined his scar and it was now concealed\nunder a neat white bandage; he had been fed; he had bathed; he had been\ngiven new clothes. Tripler was a teeming metropolis in itself, a main\nbuilding some ten stories high, a scattering of outbuildings connected\nto it by covered passages, with thousands of men and women busy about\nit. Chandler had spoken to a good many of them in the hour after waking\nup and before boarding the bus to Honolulu, and none of them had been\nfree with information either.\n\nHonolulu had not suffered greatly under the rule of the Exec.\nRemembering the shattered stateside cities, Chandler thought that this\none had been spared nearly all the suffering of the rule of the world\nby the Exec, whoever they were. Dawdling down King Street, in the\naromatic reek of the fish markets, Chandler could have thought himself\nin any port city before the grisly events of that Christmas when the\nplanet went possessed. Crabs waved sluggishly at him from bins. Great\npink-scaled fish rested on nests of ice, waiting to be sold. Smells of\nfrying food came from half a dozen restaurants. It was only the people\nwho were different. There was a solid sprinkling of those who, like\nhimself, were dressed in insigneless former Army uniforms--obviously\nconscripts on Exec errands--and a surprising minority who, from\noverheard snatches of conversation, had come from countries other than\nthe U.S.A. Russian mostly, Chandler guessed; but Russian or U.S.,\nwearing suntans or aloha shirts, everyone he saw was marked by the\nvisible signs of strain. There was no laughter.\n\nChandler saw a clock within the door of a restaurant; half an hour\nstill to kill. He turned and wandered up, away from the water, toward\nthe visible bulk of the hills; and in a moment he saw what made\nHonolulu's collective face wear its careworn frown.\n\nIt was an open square--perhaps it had once been a war memorial--and in\nthe center of it was a fenced-off paved area where people seemed to be\nresting. It struck Chandler as curious that so many persons should have\ndecided to take a nap on what surely was an uncomfortable bed of flat\nconcrete; he approached and saw that they were not resting. Not only\nhis eyes but his ears conveyed the message--and his nose, too, for the\nmild air was fetid with blood and rot.\n\nThese were not sleeping men and women. Some were dead; some were\nunconscious; all were maimed. The pavement was slimed with their blood.\nNone had the strength to scream, but several were moaning and even\nsome of the unconscious ones gasped like the breathing of a man in\ndiabetic coma. Passersby walked briskly around the metal fence, and if\ntheir glances were curious it was at Chandler they looked, not at the\ntortured wrecks before them. He understood that the sight of the dying\nmen and women was familiar--was painful--and thus was ignored; it was\nhimself who was the curiosity, for staring at them. He turned and\nfled, trying not to vomit.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was still shaken when he returned to Parts 'n Plenty. The hour\nwas up but Hsi shook his head. \"Not yet. You can sit down over there\nif you like.\" Chandler slumped into the indicated swivel chair and\nstared blankly at the wall. This was far worse than anything he had\nseen stateside. The random terror of murders and bombs was at least a\nmomentary thing, and when it was done it was done. This was sustained\ntorture. He buried his head in his hands and did not look up until he\nheard the sound of a door opening.\n\nHsi, his face somehow different, was manipulating a lever on the\noutside of a door while a man inside, becoming visible as the door\nopened, was doing the same from within. It looked as though the lock on\nthe door would not work unless both levers operated; and the man on the\ninside, whom Chandler had not seen before, was dressed, oddly, only in\nbathing trunks. His face wore the same expression as Hsi's. Chandler\nguessed (with practice it was becoming easy!) that both were possessed.\n\nThe man inside wheeled out two shopping carts loaded with electronic\nequipment of varying kinds, wordlessly received some empty ones from\nHsi; and the door closed on him again.\n\nHsi tugged the lever down, turned, blinked and said, \"All right,\nChandler. Your stuff's here.\"\n\nChandler approached. \"What was that all about?\"\n\n\"Go to hell!\" Hsi said with sudden violence. \"I--Oh never mind. Sorry.\nBut I told you already, ask somebody else your questions, not me.\" He\ngloomily began to pack the items on Chandler's list into a cardboard\ncarton. Then he glanced at Chandler and said, apologetically, \"These\nare tough times, buddy. I guess there's no harm in answering _some_\nquestions. You want to know why most of my stock's locked behind an\narmor-plate door? Well, you ought to be able to figure that out for\nyourself, anyway. The Exec doesn't like to have people playing with\nradios. Bert stays in the stockroom; I stay out here; twice a day the\nbosses open the door and we fill whatever orders they've approved. A\nlittle rough on Bert, of course. It's a ten-hour day in the stockroom\nfor him, and nothing to do. But it could be worse. Oh, that's for sure,\nfriend: It could be worse.\"\n\n\"Why the bathing suit? Hot in there?\"\n\n\"Hot for Bert if they think he's smuggling stuff out,\" said Hsi. \"You\nbeen here long enough to see the Monument yet?\"\n\nChandler shook his head, then grimaced. \"You mean up about three blocks\nthat way? Where the people--?\"\n\n\"That's right,\" said Hsi admiringly, \"three blocks mauka from here,\nwhere the people--Where the people are serving as a very good object\nlesson to you and me. About a dozen there, right? Small for this time\nof year, Chandler. Usually there are more. Notice anything special\nabout them?\"\n\n\"They were butchered! Some of them looked like their legs had been\nburned right off. Their eyes gouged out, their faces--\" Chandler\nbrought up sharply. It had been bad enough looking at those wretched,\nwrithing semi-cadavers; he did not want to talk about them.\n\nThe parts man nodded seriously. \"Sometimes there are more, and\nsometimes they're worse hurt than that. Have you got any idea how they\nget that way? They do it to themselves, that's how. My own brother was\nout there for a week, last Statehood Day. He jumped feet first into a\nconcrete mixer, and it took him seven days to die after I put him on my\nshoulder and carried him out there. I didn't like it, of course, but\nI didn't exactly have any choice; I wasn't running my own body at the\ntime. Neither was he when he jumped. He was made to do it, because he\nused to have Bert's job and he thought he'd take a little short-wave\nset home. Like I said, you don't want to cheat on the Exec because it\ndoesn't pay.\"\n\n\"But what the devil am I supposed to--\"\n\nHsi held up his hand. \"Don't ask me how to keep out of that Monument\nbunch, Chandler. _I_ don't know. Do what you're told and don't do\nanything you aren't told to do; that is the whole of the law. Now do me\na favor and get out of here so I can pack up these other orders.\" He\nturned his back on Chandler.\n\n\nVIII\n\nBy the morning of the fourth day on the island of Oahu, Chandler had\nlearned enough of the ropes to have signed a money-chit at the Tripler\ncurrency office against Koitska's account.\n\nThat was about all he had learned, except for a few practical matters\nlike where meals were served and the location of the fresh-water\nswimming pool at the back of the grounds. He was killing time using the\npool when, in the middle of a jacknife from the ten-foot board, he felt\nhimself seized. He sprawled into the water with a hard splashing slap,\nthreshed about and, as he came to the surface, found himself giggling.\n\n\"Sorry, dear,\" he apologized to himself, \"but we don't carry our weight\nin the same places, you know. Get that square-what'sit thingamajig,\nlike an angel, and meet me in front by the flagpole in twenty minutes.\"\n\nHe recognized the voice, even if his own vocal chords had made it. It\nwas the girl who had driven him back from the interview with Koitska,\nthe one who had casually announced she had saved his life at his\nhoaxing trial. Chandler swam to the side of the pool and toweled as he\ntrotted toward his quarters. She was from Koitska now, of course; which\nmeant that his \"test\" was about to be graded.\n\nQuickly though he dressed, she was there before him, standing beside a\nlow-slung sports car and chatting with one of the groundskeepers. An\narmful of leis dangled beside her, and although she wore the coronet\nwhich was evidence of her status the gardener did not seem to fear\nher. \"Come along, love,\" she called to Chandler. \"Koitska wants your\nthingummy. Chuck it in the trunk if it'll fit, and we'll head waikiki\nwikiwiki. Don't I say that nicely? But I only fool the malihinis, like\nyou.\"\n\nShe chattered away as the little car dug its rear wheels into the drive\nand leaped around the green and out the gate.\n\nThe wind howled by them, the sun was bright, the sky was piercingly\nblue. Riding next to this beautiful girl, it was hard for Chandler to\nremember that she was one of those who had destroyed his world. It was\na terrible thing to have so much hatred and to feel it so diluted.\nNot even Koitska seemed a terrible enough enemy to accept such a load\nof detestation; it was hate without an object, and it recoiled on the\nhater, leaving him turgid and constrained. If he could not hate his\nonetime friend Jack Souther for defiling and destroying his wife, it\nwas almost as hard to hate Souther's anonymous possessor. It could\neven have been Koitska. It could even have been this girl by his\nside. In the strange, cruel fantasies with which the Execs indulged\nthemselves it was likely enough that they would sometimes assume the\nbody, and the role, of the opposite sex. Why not? Strange, ruthless\nmorality; it was impossible to evaluate it by any human standards.\n\nIt was also impossible to think of hatred with her beside him. They\nsoared around Honolulu on a broad expressway and paralleled the beach\ntoward Waikiki. \"Look, dear. Diamond Head! Mustn't ignore it--very bad\nform--like not going to see the night-blooming cereus at the Punahou\nSchool. You haven't missed that, have you?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I have--\"\n\n\"Rosalie. Call me Rosalie, dear.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I have, Rosalie.\" For some reason the name sounded familiar.\n\n\"Shame, oh, shame! They say it was wonderful night before last. Looks\nlike cactus to me, but--\"\n\nChandler's mental processes had worked to a conclusion. \"Rosalie\n_Pan_!\" he said. \"Now I know!\"\n\n\"Know what? You mean--\" she swerved around a motionless Buick, parked\narrogantly five feet from the curb--\"you mean you didn't know who I\nwas? And to think I used to pay five thousand a year for publicity.\"\n\nChandler said, smiling, and almost relaxed, \"I'm sorry, but musical\ncomedies weren't my strong point. I did see you once, though, on\ntelevision. Then, let's see, wasn't there something about you\ndisappearing--\"\n\nShe nodded, glancing at him. \"There sure was, dear. I almost froze to\ndeath getting out to that airport. Of course, it was worth it, I found\nout later. If I hadn't been took, as they say, I would've been dead,\nbecause you remember what happened to New York about an hour later.\"\n\n\"You must have had some friends,\" Chandler began, and let it trail off.\nSo did the girl. After a moment she began to talk about the scenery\nagain, pointing out the brick-red and purple bougainvillea, describing\nhow the shoreline had looked before they'd \"cleaned it up.\" \"Oh,\nthousands and thousands of the _homeliest_ little houses. You'd have\nhated it. So we have done at least a few good things, anyway,\" she said\ncomplacently, and began gently to probe into his life story. But as\nthey stopped before the TWA message center, a few moments later, she\nsaid, \"Well, love, it's been fun. Go on in; Koitska's expecting you.\nI'll see you later.\" And her eyes added gently: _I hope_.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nChandler got out of the car, turned ... and felt himself taken. His\nvoice said briskly, \"_Zdrastvoi, Rosie. Gd'yeh Koitska?_\"\n\nUnsurprised the girl pointed to the building. \"_Kto govorit?_\"\n\nChandler's voice answered in English, with a faint Oxford accent:\n\"It is I, Rosie, Kalman. Where's Koitska's tinkertoy? Oh, all right,\nthanks; I'll just pick it up and take it in. Hope it's all right. I\nmust say one wearies of breaking in these new fellows.\"\n\nChandler's body ambled around to the trunk of the car, took out the\nsquare-wave generator on its breadboard base and slouched into the\nbuilding. It called ahead in the same language and was answered\nwheezily from above: Koitska. \"_Zdrastvoi. Iditye suda ko mneh. Kto,\nKalman?_\"\n\n\"_Konyekhno!_\" cried Chandler's voice and he was carried in and up to\nwhere the fat man lounged in a leather-upholstered wheel-chair. There\nwas a conversation, long minutes of it, while the two men poked at\nthe generator. Chandler did not understand a word until he spoke to\nhimself: \"You--what's your name.\"\n\n\"Chandler,\" Koitska filled in.\n\n\"You, Chandler. D'you know anything at all about submillimeter\nmicrowaves? Tell Koitska.\" Briefly Chandler felt himself free--long\nenough to nod; then he was possessed again, and Koitska repeated the\nnod. \"Good, then. Tell Koitska what experience you've had.\"\n\nAgain free, Chandler said, \"Not a great deal of actual experience. I\nworked with a group at Caltech on spectroscopic measurements in the\nmillion megacycle range. I didn't design any of the equipment, though I\nhelped put it together.\" He recited his degrees until Koitska raised a\nlanguid hand.\n\n\"_Shto_, I don't care. If ve gave you diagrams you could build?\"\n\n\"Certainly, if I had the equipment. I suppose I'd need--\"\n\nBut Koitska stopped him again. \"I know vot you need,\" he said damply.\n\"Enough. Ve see.\" In a moment Chandler was taken again, and his voice\nand Koitska's debated the matter for a while, until Koitska shrugged,\nturned his head and seemed to go to sleep.\n\nChandler marched himself out of the room and out into the driveway\nbefore his voice said to him: \"You've secured a position, then. Go back\nto Tripler until we send for you. It'll be a few days, I expect.\"\n\nAnd Chandler was free again.\n\nHe was also alone. The girl in the Porsche was gone. The door of the\nTWA building had latched itself behind him. He stared around him,\nswore, shrugged and circled the building to the parking lot at back, on\nthe chance that a car might be there for him to borrow.\n\nLuckily, there was. There were four, in fact, all with keys in them. He\nselected a Ford, puzzled out the likeliest road back to Honolulu and\nturned the key in the starter.\n\nIt was fortunate, he thought, that there had been several cars; if\nthere had been only one he would not have dared to take it, for fear of\nstranding Koitska or some other exec who might easily blot him out in\nannoyance. He did not wish to join the wretches at the Monument.\n\nIt was astonishing how readily fear had become a part of his life.\n\nThe trouble with this position he had somehow secured--one of the\ntroubles--was that there was no union delegate to settle employee\ngrievances. Like no transportation. Like no clear idea of working\nhours, or duties. Like no mention at all--of course--of wages. Chandler\nhad no idea what his rights were, if any at all, or of what the\npenalties would be if he overstepped them.\n\nThe maimed victims at the Monument supplied a clue, of course. He could\nnot really believe that that sort of punishment would be applied for\nminor infractions. Death was so much less trouble. Even death was not\nreally likely, he thought, for a simple lapse.\n\nHe _thought_.\n\nHe could not be sure, of course. He could be sure of only one thing:\nHe was now a slave, completely a slave, a slave until the day he\ndied. Back on the mainland there was the statistical likelihood of\noccasional slavery-by-possession, but there it was only the body that\nwas enslaved, and only for moments. Here, in the shadow of the execs,\nit was all of him, forever, until death or a miracle turned him loose.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the second day following he returned to his room at Tripler after\nbreakfast, and found a Honolulu city policeman sitting hollow-eyed on\nthe edge of his bed. The man stood up as Chandler came in. \"So,\" he\ngrumbled, \"you take so long! Here. Is diagrams, specs, parts lists,\nall. You get everything three days from now, then we begin.\"\n\nThe policeman, no longer Koitska, shook himself, glanced stolidly\nat Chandler and walked out, leaving a thick manila envelope on the\npillow. On it was written, in a crabbed hand: _All secret! Do not show\ndiagrams!_\n\nChandler opened the envelope and spilled its contents on the bed.\n\nAn hour later he realized that sixty minutes had passed in which he had\nnot been afraid. It was good to be working again, he thought, and then\nthat thought faded away again as he returned to studying the sheaves of\ncircuit diagrams and closely typed pages of specifications. It was not\nonly work, it was hard work, and absorbing. Chandler knew enough about\nthe very short wavelength radio spectrum to know that the device he was\nsupposed to build was no proficiency test; this was for real. The more\nhe puzzled over it the less he could understand of its purpose. There\nwas a transmitter and there was a receiver. Astonishingly, neither was\ndirectional: that ruled out radar, for example. He rejected immediately\nthe thought that the radiation was for spectrum analysis, as in the\nCaltech project--unfortunate, because that was the only application\nwith which he had first-hand familiarity; but impossible. The thing\nwas too complicated. Nor could it be a simple message transmitter--no,\nperhaps it could, assuming there was a reason for using the\nsubmillimeter bands instead of the conventional, far simpler short-wave\nspectrum. Could it? The submillimeter waves were line-of-sight, of\ncourse, but would ionosphere scatter make it possible for them to\ncover great distances? He could not remember. Or was that irrelevant,\nsince perhaps they needed only to cover the distances between islands\nin their own archipelago? But then, why all the power? And in any case,\nwhat about this fantastic switching panel, hundreds of square feet of\nit even though it was transistorized and subminiaturized and involving\nat least a dozen sophisticated technical refinements he hadn't the\ntraining quite to understand? AT&T could have handled every phone call\nin the United States with less switching than this--in the days when\ntelephone systems spanned a nation instead of a fraction of a city. He\npushed the papers together in a pile and sat back, smoking a cigarette,\ntrying to remember what he could of the theory behind submillimeter\nradiation.\n\nAt half a million megacycles and up, the domain of quantum theory began\nto be invaded. Rotating gas molecules, constricted to a few energy\nstates, responded directly to the radio waves. Chandler remembered\nlate-night bull sessions in Pasadena during which it had been pointed\nout that the possibilities in the field were enormous--although only\npossibilities, for there was no engineering way to reach them, and\nno clear theory to point the way--suggesting such strange ultimate\npractical applications as the receiverless radio, for example. Was that\nwhat he had here?\n\nHe gave up. It was a question that would burn at him until he found the\nanswer, but just now he had work to do, and he'd better be doing it.\n\nSkipping lunch entirely, he carefully checked the components lists,\nmade a copy of what he would need, checked the original envelope and\nits contents with the man at the main receiving desk for his safe, and\ncaught the bus to Honolulu.\n\nAt the Parts 'n Plenty store, Hsi read the list with a faint frown that\nturned into a puzzled scowl. When he put it down he looked at Chandler\nfor a few moments without speaking.\n\n\"Well, Hsi? Can you get all this for me?\" The parts man shrugged and\nnodded. \"Koitska said in three days.\"\n\nHsi looked startled, then resigned. \"That puts it right up to me,\ndoesn't it? All right. Wait a moment.\"\n\nHe disappeared in the back of the store, where Chandler heard him\ntalking on what was evidently an intercom system. He came back in a\nfew minutes and slipped Chandler's list into a slit in the locked\ndoor. \"Tough for Bert,\" he said. \"He'll be working all night, getting\nstarted--but I can take it easy till tomorrow. By then he'll know what\nwe don't have, and I'll find some way to get it.\" He shrugged again,\nbut his face was lined. Chandler wondered how one went about finding,\nfor example, a thirty megawatt klystron tube; but it was Hsi's problem.\nHe said:\n\n\"All right, I'll see you Monday.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute, Chandler.\" Hsi eyed him. \"You don't have anything\nspecial to do, do you? Well, come have dinner with me. Maybe I can get\nto know you. Then maybe I can answer some of your questions, if you\nlike.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey took a bus out Kapiolani Boulevard, then got out and walked a\nfew blocks to a restaurant named Mother Chee's. Hsi was well known\nthere, it seemed. He led Chandler to a booth at the back, nodded to\nthe waiter, ordered without looking at the menu and sat back. \"You\nmalihinis don't know much about food,\" he said, humorously patronizing.\n\"I think you'll like it. It's all fish, anyway.\"\n\nThe man was annoying. Chandler was moved to say, \"Too bad, I was hoping\nfor duck in orange sauce, perhaps some snow peas--\"\n\nHsi shook his head. \"There's meat, all right, but not here. You'll\nonly find it in the places where the execs sometimes go.... Tell me\nsomething, Chandler. What's that scar on your forehead.\"\n\nChandler touched it, almost with surprise. Since the medics had treated\nit he had almost forgotten it was there. He began to explain, then\npaused, looking at Hsi, and changed his mind. \"What's the score? You\ntesting me, too? Want to see if I'll lie about it?\"\n\nHsi grinned. \"Sorry. I guess that's what I was doing. I do know what an\n'H' stands for; we've seen them before. Not many. The ones that do get\nthis far usually don't last long. Unless, of course, they are working\nfor somebody whom it wouldn't do to offend,\" he explained.\n\n\"So what you want to know, then, is whether I was really hoaxing or\nnot. Does it make any difference?\"\n\n\"Damn right it does, man! We're slaves, but we're not animals!\"\nChandler had gotten to him; the parts man looked startled, then sallow,\nas he observed his own vehemence.\n\n\"Sorry, Hsi. It makes a difference to me, too. Well, I wasn't hoaxing.\nI was possessed, just like any other everyday rapist-murderer, only I\ncouldn't prove it. And it didn't look too good for me, because the\ndamn thing happened in a pharmaceuticals plant. That was supposed to be\nabout the only place in town where you could be sure you wouldn't be\npossessed, or so everybody thought. Including me. Up to the time I went\nape.\"\n\nHsi nodded. The waiter approached with their drinks. Hsi looked at\nhim appraisingly, then did a curious thing. He gripped his left wrist\nwith his right hand, quickly, then released it again. The waiter did\nnot appear to notice. Expertly he served the drinks, folded small pink\nfloral napkins, dumped and wiped their ashtray in one motion--and then,\nso quickly that Chandler was not quite sure he had seen it, caught\nHsi's wrist in the same fleeting gesture just before he turned and\nwalked away.\n\nWithout comment Hsi turned back to Chandler. He said, \"I believe you.\nWould you like to know why it happened? Because I think I can tell you.\nThe execs have all the antibiotics they need now.\"\n\n\"You mean--\" Chandler hesitated.\n\n\"That's right. They did leave some areas alone, as long as they weren't\nfully stocked on everything they might want for the foreseeable future.\nWouldn't you?\"\n\n\"I might,\" Chandler said cautiously, \"if I knew what I was--being an\nexec.\"\n\nHsi said, \"Eat your dinner. I'll take a chance and tell you what I\nknow.\" He swallowed his whiskey-on-the-rocks with a quick backward jerk\nof the head. \"They're mostly Russians--you must know that much for\nyourself. The whole thing started in Russia.\"\n\nChandler said, \"Well, that's pretty obvious. But Russia was smashed\nup as much as anywhere else. The whole Russian government was\nkilled--wasn't it?\"\n\nHsi nodded. \"They're not the government. Not the exec. Communism\ndoesn't mean any more to them than the Declaration of Independence\ndoes--which is nothing. It's very simple, Chandler: they're a project\nthat got out of hand.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBack four years ago, he said, in Russia, it started in the last days\nof the Second Stalinite Regime, before the Neo-Krushchevists took over\npower in the January Push.\n\nThe Western World had not known exactly what was going on, of course.\nThe \"mystery wrapped in a riddle surrounded by an enigma\" had become\nqueerer and even more opaque after Kruschchev's death and the revival\nof such fine old Soviet institutions as the Gay Pay Oo. That was the\ndevelopment called the Freeze, when the Stalinites seized control\nin the name of the sacred Generalissimo of the Soviet Fatherland, a\nmighty-missile party, dedicated to bringing about the world revolution\nby force of sputnik. The neo-Krushchevists, on the other hand, believed\nthat honey caught more flies than vinegar; and, although there were few\nvisible adherents to that philosophy during the purges of the Freeze,\nthey were not all dead. Then, out of the Donbas Electrical Workshop,\ncame sudden support for their point of view.\n\nIt was a weapon. It was more than a weapon, an irresistable tool--more\nthan that, the way to end all disputes forever. It was a simple radio\ntransmitter (Hsi said)--or so it seemed, but its frequencies were on\nan unusual band and its effects were remarkable. It controlled the\nminds of men. The \"receiver\" was the human brain. Through this little\nportable transmitter, surgically patch-wired to the brain of the person\noperating it, his entire personality was transmitted in a pattern of\nvery short waves which could invade and modulate the personality of any\nother human being in the world. For that matter, of any animal, as long\nas the creature had enough \"mind\" to seize--\n\n\"What's the matter?\" Hsi interrupted himself, staring at Chandler.\nChandler had stopped eating, his hand frozen midway to his mouth. He\nshook his head.\n\n\"Nothing. Go on.\" Hsi shrugged and continued.\n\nWhile the Western World was celebrating Christmas--the Christmas before\nthe first outbreak of possession in the outside world--the man who\ninvented the machine was secretly demonstrating it to another man. Both\nof them were now dead. The inventor had been a Pole, the other man a\nformer Party leader who, four years before, had rescued the inventor's\ndying father from a Siberian work camp. The Party leader had reason to\ncongratulate himself on that loaf cast on the water. There were only\nthree working models of the transmitter--what ultimately was refined\ninto the coronet Chandler had seen on the heads of Koitska and the\ngirl--but that was enough for the January push.\n\nThe Stalinites were out. The neo-Krushchevists were in.\n\nA whole factory in the Donbas was converted to manufacturing these\nlittle mental controllers as fast as they could be produced--and\nthat was fast, for they were simple in design to begin with and were\nquickly refined to a few circuits. Even the surgical wiring to the\nbrain became unnecessary as induction coils tapped the encephalic\nrhythms. Only the great amplifying hookup was really complicated. Only\none of those was necessary, for a single amplifier could serve as\nre-broadcaster--modulator for thousands of the headsets.\n\n\"Are you sure you're all right?\" Hsi demanded.\n\nChandler put down his fork, lit a cigarette and beckoned to the waiter.\n\"I'm all right. I just want another drink.\"\n\nHe needed the drink. For now he knew what he was building for Koitska.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe waiter brought two more drinks and carried away the uneaten food.\n\"We don't know exactly who did what after that,\" Hsi said, \"but\nsomehow or other it got out of hand. I think it was the technical\ncrew of the factory that took over. I suppose it was an inevitable\ndanger.\" He grinned savagely. \"I can just imagine the Party workers\nin the factory,\" he said, \"trying to figure out how to keep them in\nline--bribe them or terrify them? Give them dachas or send a quota\nto Siberia? Neither would work, of course, because there isn't any\nbribe you can give to a man who only has to stretch out his hand to\ntake over the world, and you can't frighten a man who can make you\nslit your own throat. Anyway, the next thing that happened--the\nfollowing Christmas--was when they took over the world. It wasn't a\nParty movement at all any more. A lot of the workers were Czechs and\nHungarians and Poles, and the first thing they wanted to do was to\neven a few scores.\n\n\"So here they are! Before they let the whole world go bang they got out\nof range. They got themselves out of Russia on two Red Navy cruisers,\nabout a thousand of them; then they systematically triggered off every\nballistic missile they could find ... and they could find all of them,\nsooner or later, it was just a matter of looking. As soon as it was\nsafe they moved in here. Best place in the world for them.\n\n\"There are only a thousand or so of them here on the Islands, and\nnobody outside the Islands even knows where they are. If they did, what\ngood would it do them? They can kill anyone, anywhere. They kill for\nfun, but sometimes they kill for a reason too. When one of them goes\nwandering for kicks he makes it a point to mess up all the transport\nand communications facilities he comes across--especially now, since\nthey've stockpiled everything they're likely to need for the next\ntwenty years. We don't know what they're planning to do when the twenty\nyears are up. Maybe they don't care. Would you?\"\n\nChandler drained his drink and shook his head. \"One question,\" he said.\n\"Who's 'we'?\"\n\nHsi carefully unwrapped a package of cigarettes, took one out and lit\nit. He looked at it as though he were not enjoying it; cigarettes had a\nway of tasting stale these days. As they were. \"Just a minute,\" he said.\n\nTardily Chandler remembered the quick grasp of the waiter's fingers on\nHsi's wrist, and that the waiter had been hovering, inconspicuously\nclose, all through their meal. Hsi was waiting for the man to return.\n\nIn a moment the waiter was back, looking directly at Chandler. He\nlooped his own wrist with his fingers and nodded. Hsi said softly,\n\"'We' is the Society of Slaves. That's all of us--slaves--but only a\nfew of us belong to the Society. We--\"\n\nThere was a crash of glass. The waiter had dropped their tray.\n\nAcross the table from Chandler, Hsi looked suddenly changed. His left\nhand lay on the table before him, his right hand poised over it.\nApparently he had been about to show Chandler again the sign he had\nmade.\n\nBut he could not do it. His hand paused and fluttered, like a captured\nbird. Captured it was. Hsi was captured. Out of Hsi's mouth, with\nHsi's voice, came the light, tonal rhythms of Rosalie Pan. \"_This_\nis an unexpected pleasure, love! I never expected to see you here.\nEnjoying your meal?\"\n\n\nIX\n\nChandler had his empty glass halfway to his lips, automatically, before\nhe realized there was nothing in it to brace him. He said hoarsely,\n\"Yes, thanks. Do you come here often?\" It was like the banal talk of a\nlanguage guide, wildly inappropriate to what had been going on a moment\nbefore. He was shaken.\n\n\"Oh, I love it,\" cooed Hsi, investigating the dishes before him. \"All\nfinished, I see. Too bad. Your friend doesn't feel like he ate much,\neither.\"\n\n\"I guess he wasn't hungry,\" Chandler managed.\n\n\"Well, I am.\" Hsi cocked his head and smiled like a female\nimpersonator. \"I know! Are you doing anything special right now, love?\nI know you've eaten, but--well, I've been a good girl and I guess I can\neat a real meal, I mean not with somebody else's teeth, and still keep\nthe calories in line. Suppose I meet you down at the Beach? There's a\nplace there where the luau is divine. I can be there in half an hour.\"\n\nChandler's breathing was back to normal. Why not? \"I'll be delighted.\"\n\n\"Luigi the Wharf Rat, that's the name of it. They won't let you in,\nthough, unless you tell them you're with me. It's special.\" Hsi's eye\nclosed in Rosalie Pan's wink. \"Half an hour,\" Hsi said, and was again\nhimself. He began to shake.\n\nThe waiter brought him straight whiskey and, pretense abandoned, stood\nby while Hsi drank it. After a moment he said, \"Scares you. But--I\nguess we're all right. She couldn't have heard much. You'd better go,\nChandler. I'll talk to you again some other time.\"\n\nChandler stood up. But he couldn't leave Hsi like that. \"Are you all\nright?\"\n\nHsi almost managed control. \"Oh--I think so. Not the first time it's\ncome close, you know. Sooner or later it'll come closer still, and that\nwill be the end, but--yes, I'm all right for now.\"\n\nChandler tarried. \"You were saying something about the Society of\nSlaves.\"\n\n\"Damn it, go!\" Hsi barked. \"She'll be waiting for you.... Sorry,\nI didn't mean to shout. But go.\" As Chandler turned, he said more\nquietly, \"Come around to the store tomorrow. Maybe we can finish our\ntalk then.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLuigi the Wharf Rat's was not actually on the beach but on the bank of\na body of water called the Ala Wai Canal. Across the water were the\nsnowtopped hills. A maitre-de escorted Chandler personally to a table\non a balcony, and there he waited. Rosalie's \"half-hour\" was nearly\ntwo; but then he heard her calling him from across the room, in the\nvoice which had reached a thousand second balconies, and he rose as she\ncame near.\n\nShe said lightly, \"Sorry. You ought to be flattered, though. It's a\ntwenty-minute drive--and an hour and a half to put on my face, so you\nwon't be ashamed to be seen with me. Well, it's good to be out in my\nown skin for a change. Let's eat!\"\n\nThe talk with Hsi had left a mark on Chandler that not even this girl's\npretty face could obscure. It was a pretty face, though, and she was\nobviously exerting herself to make him enjoy himself. He could not help\nresponding to her mood.\n\nShe talked of her life on the stage, the excitement of a performance,\nthe entertainers she had known. Her conversation was one long\nname-drop, but it was not pretense: the world of the famous was the\nworld she had lived in. It was not a world that Chandler had ever\nvisited, but he recognized the names. Rosie had been married once to\nan English actor whose movies Chandler had made a point of watching on\ntelevision. It was interesting, in a way, to know that the man snored\nand lived principally on vitamin pills. But it was a view of the man\nthat Chandler had not sought.\n\nThe restaurant drew its clientele mostly from the execs, young ones or\nyoung-acting ones, like the girl. The coronets were all over. There had\nbeen a sign on the door:\n\n    KAPU, WALIHINI!\n\nto mark it off limits to anyone not an exec or a collaborator. Still,\nChandler thought, who on the island was not a collaborator? The only\neffective resistance a man could make would be to kill everyone\nwithin reach and then himself, thus depriving them of slaves--and\nthat was, after all, only what the execs themselves had done in other\nplaces often enough. It would inconvenience them only slightly. The\nnext few planeloads or shiploads of possessed warm bodies from the\nmainland would be permitted to live, instead of being required to dash\nthemselves to destruction, like the crew of the airplane that had\ncarried Chandler. Thus the domestic stocks would be replenished.\n\nAn annoying feature of dining with Rosalie in the flesh, Chandler\nfound, was that half a dozen times while they were talking he found\nhimself taken, speaking words to Rosie that were not his own, usually\nin a language he did not understand. She took it as a matter of\ncourse. It was merely a friend, across the room or across the island,\nusing Chandler as the casual convenience of a telephone. \"Sorry,\" she\napologized blithely after it happened for the third time, and then\nstopped. \"You don't like that, love, do you?\"\n\n\"Can you blame me?\" He stopped himself from saying more; he was\nastonished even so at his tone.\n\nShe said it for him. \"I know. It takes away your manhood, I suppose.\nPlease don't let it do that to you, love. We're not so bad. Even--\"\nShe hesitated, and did not go on. \"You know,\" she said, \"I came here\nthe same way you did. Kidnaped off the stage of the Winter Garden. Of\ncourse, the difference was the one who kidnaped me was an old friend.\nThough I didn't know it at the time and it scared me half to death.\"\n\nChandler must have looked startled. She nodded. \"You've been thinking\nof us as another race, haven't you? Like the Neanderthals or--well,\nworse than that, maybe.\" She smiled. \"We're not. About half of us\ncame from Russia in the first place, but the others are from all over.\nYou'd be astonished, really.\" She mentioned several names, world-famous\nscientists, musicians, writers. \"Of course, not everybody can qualify\nfor the club, love. Wouldn't be exclusive otherwise. The chief rule\nis loyalty. I'm loyal,\" she added gently after a moment, \"and don't\nyou forget it. Have to be. Whoever becomes an exec has to be with us,\nall the way. There are tests. It has to be that way--not only for our\nprotection. For the world's.\"\n\nChandler was genuinely startled at that. Rosie nodded seriously. \"If\none exec should give away something he's not supposed to it would upset\nthe whole applecart. There are only a thousand of us, and I guess\nprobably two billion of you, or nearly. The result would be complete\ndestruction.\"\n\nOf the Executive Committee, Chandler thought she meant at first, but\nthen he thought again. No. Of the world. For the thousand execs,\noutnumbered though they were two million to one, could not fail to\ntriumph. The contest would not be in doubt. If the whole thousand execs\nat once began systematically to kill and destroy, instead of merely\nplaying at it as the spirit moved them, they could all but end the\nhuman race overnight. A man could be made to slash his throat in a\nquarter of a minute. An exec, killing, killing, killing without pause,\ncould destroy his own two million enemies in an eight-hour day.\n\nAnd there were surer, faster ways. Chandler did not have to imagine\nthem, he had seen them. The massacre of the Orphalese, the victims at\nthe Monument--they were only crumbs of destruction. What had happened\nto New York City showed what mass-production methods could do. No doubt\nthere were bombs left, even if only chemical ones. Shoot, stab, crash,\nblow up; swallow poison, leap from window, slit throat. Every man a\nmurderer, at the touch of a mind from Hawaii; and if no one else was\nnear to murder, surely each man could find a victim in himself. In\none ravaging day mankind would cease to exist as a major force. In a\nweek the only survivors would be those in such faroff and hopelessly\nimpotent places that they were not worth the trouble of tracking down.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You hate us, don't you?\"\n\nChandler paused and tried to find an answer. Rosie was not either\nbelligerent or mocking. She was only sympathetically trying to reach\nhis point of view. He shook his head silently.\n\n\"Not meaning 'no'--meaning 'no comment'? Well, I don't blame you, love.\nBut do you see that we're not altogether a bad thing? It's bad that\nthere should be so much violence. In a way. Hasn't there always been\nviolence? And what were the alternatives? Until we came along the world\nwas getting ready to kill itself anyway.\"\n\n\"There's a difference,\" Chandler mumbled. He was thinking of his wife.\nHe and Margot had loved each other as married couples do--without any\nvery great, searing compulsion; but with affection, with habit and\nwith sporadic passion. Chandler had not given much thought to the\nwhole, though he was aware of the parts, during the last years of his\nmarriage. It was only after Margot's murder that he had come to know\nthat the sum of those parts was a quite irreplaceable love.\n\nBut Rosie was shaking her head. \"The difference is all on our side.\nSuppose Koitska's boss had never discovered the coronets. At any moment\none country might have got nervous and touched off the whole thing--not\ncarefully, the way we did it, with most of the really dirty missiles\nfused safe and others landing where they were supposed to go. I mean,\ntouched off a _war_. The end, love. The bloody _finis_. The ones that\nwere killed at once would have been the lucky ones. No, love,\" she\nsaid, in dead earnest, \"we aren't the worst things that ever happened\nto the world. Once the--well, the _bad_ part--is over, people will\nunderstand what we really are.\"\n\n\"And what's that, exactly?\"\n\nShe hesitated, smiled and said modestly, \"We're gods.\"\n\nIt took Chandler's breath away--not because it was untrue, but because\nit had never occurred to him that gods were aware of their deity.\n\n\"We're gods, love, with the privilege of electing mortals to the club.\nDon't judge us by anything that has gone before. Don't judge us by\nanything. We are a New Thing. We don't have to conform to precedent\nbecause we upset all precedents. From now on, to the end of time, the\nrules will grow from us.\"\n\nShe patted her lips briskly with a napkin and said, \"Would you like to\nsee something? Let's take a little walk.\"\n\nShe took him by the hand and led him across the room, out to a sundeck\non the other side of the restaurant. They were looking down on what had\nonce been a garden. There were people in it; Chandler was conscious of\nsounds coming from them, and he was able to see that there were dozens\nof them, perhaps a hundred, and that they all seemed to be wearing\nsuntans like his own.\n\n\"From Tripler?\" he guessed.\n\n\"No, love. They pick out those clothes themselves. Stand there a\nminute.\"\n\nThe girl in the coronet walked out to the rail of the sundeck, where\npink and amber spotlights were playing on nothing. As she came into the\ncolored lights there was a sigh from the people in the garden. A man\nwalked forward with an armload of leis and deposited them on the ground\nbelow the rail.\n\nThey were _adoring_ her.\n\nRosalie stood gravely for a moment, then nodded and returned to\nChandler.\n\n\"They began doing that about a year ago,\" she whispered to him, as a\nmurmur of disappointment came up from the crowd. \"Their own idea. We\ndidn't know what they wanted at first, but they weren't doing any harm.\nYou see, love,\" she said softly, \"we can make them do anything we like.\nBut we don't make them do that.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHours later, Chandler was not sure just how, they were in a light plane\nflying high over the Pacific, clear out of sight of land. The moon was\ngold above them, the ocean black beneath.\n\nChandler stared down as the girl circled the plane, slipping lower\ntoward the water, silent and perplexed. But he was not afraid. He was\nalmost content. Rosie was good company--gay, cheerful--and she had\ntreasures to share. It had been an impulse of hers, a long drive in\nher sports car and a quick, comfortable flight over the ocean to cap\nthe evening. It had been a pleasant impulse. He reflected gravely that\nhe could understand now how generations of country maidens had been\ndazzled and despoiled. A touch of luxury was a great seducer.\n\nThe coronet on the girl's body could catch his body at any moment. She\nhad only to think herself into his mind, and her will, flashed to a\nrelay station like the one he was building for Koitska, at loose in\ninfinity, could sweep into him and make him a puppet. If she chose, he\nwould open that door beside him and step out into a thousand feet of\nair and a meal for the sharks.\n\nBut he did not think she would do it. He did not think anyone would,\nreally, though with his own eyes he had seen some anyones do things as\nbad as that and sickeningly worse. There was no corrupt whim of the\nmost diseased mind in history that some torpid exec had not visited\non a helpless man, woman or child in the past years. Even as they\nflew here, Chandler knew, the gross bodies that lay in luxury in the\nisland's villas were surging restlessly around the world; and death and\nhorror remained where they had passed. It was a paradox too great to be\nreconciled, this girl and this vileness. He could not forget it, but he\ncould not feel it in his glands. She was pretty. She was gay. He began\nto think thoughts that had left him alone for a long time.\n\nThe dark bulk of the island showed ahead and they were sinking toward a\nlanding.\n\nThe girl landed skillfully on a runway that sprang into light as she\napproached--electronic wizardry, or the coronet and some tethered serf\nat a switch? It didn't matter. Nothing mattered very greatly at that\nmoment to Chandler.\n\n\"Thank you, love,\" she said, laughing. \"I liked that. It's all very\nwell to use someone else's body for this sort of thing, but every now\nand then I want to keep my own in practice.\"\n\nShe linked arms with him as they left the plane. \"When I was first\ngiven the coronet here,\" she reminisced, amusement in her voice, \"I\ngot the habit real bad. I spent six awful months--really, six months\nin bed! And by myself at that. Oh, I was all over the world, and\nskin-diving on the Barrier Reef and skiing in Norway and--well,\" she\nsaid, squeezing his arm, \"never _mind_ what all. And then one day I got\non the scales, just out of habit. Do you know what I _weighed_?\" She\nclosed her eyes in mock horror, but they were smiling when she opened\nthem again. \"I won't do that again, love. Of course, a lot of us do\nlet ourselves go. Even Koitska. Especially Koitska. And some of the\nwomen--But just between us, the ones who do really didn't have much to\nkeep in shape in the first place.\"\n\nShe led the way into a villa that smelled of jasmine and gardenias,\nsnapped her fingers and subdued lights came on. \"Like it? Oh, we've\nnothing but the best. What would you like to drink?\"\n\nShe fixed them both tall, cold glasses and vetoed Chandler's choice of\na sprawling wicker chair to sit on. \"Over here, love.\" She patted the\ncouch beside her. She drew up her legs, leaning against him, very soft,\nwarm and fragrant, and said dreamily, \"Let me see. What's nice? What do\nyou like in music, love?\"\n\n\"Oh ... anything.\"\n\n\"No, no! You're supposed to say, 'Why, the original-cast album from\n_Hi There_.' Or anything else I starred in.\" She shook her head\nreprovingly, and the points of her coronet caught golden reflections\nfrom the lights. \"But since you're obviously a man of low taste\nI'll have to do the whole bit myself.\" She touched switches at a\nremote-control set by her end of the couch, and in a moment dreamy\nstrings began to come from tri-aural speakers hidden around the room.\nIt was not _Hi There_. \"That's better,\" she said drowsily, and in a\nmoment, \"Wasn't it nice in the plane?\"\n\n\"It was fine,\" Chandler said. Gently--but firmly--he sat up and reached\nautomatically into his pocket.\n\nThe girl sighed and straightened. \"Cigarette? They're on the table\nbeside you. Hope you like the brand. They only keep one big factory\ngoing, not to count those terrible Russian things that're all air and\nno smoke.\" She touched his forehead with cool fingers. \"You never told\nme about that, love.\"\n\nIt was like an electric shock--the touch of her fingers and the touch\nof reality at once. Chandler said stiffly, \"My brand. But I thought you\nwere there at the trial.\"\n\n\"Oh, only now and then. I missed all the naughty parts--though, to tell\nthe truth, that's why I was hanging around. I do like to hear a little\nnaughtiness now and then ... but all I heard was that stupid lawyer and\nthat stupid judge. Made me mad.\" She giggled. \"Lucky for you. I was so\nirritated I decided to spoil their fun too.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nChandler sat up and took a long pull at his drink. Curiously, it seemed\nto sober him. He said: \"It's nothing. I happened to rape and kill a\nyoung girl. Happens every day. Of course, it was one of your friends\nthat was doing it for me, but I didn't miss any of what was going on,\nI can give you a blow-by-blow description if you like. The people in\nthe town where I lived, at that time, thought I was doing it on my own,\nthough, and they didn't approve. Hoaxing--you know? They thought I was\nso perverse and cruel that I would do that sort of thing under my own\npower, instead of with some exec--or, as they would have put it, being\nignorant, some imp, or devil, or demon--pulling the strings.\"\n\nHe was shaking. He waited for what she had to say; but she only\nwhispered, \"I'm sorry, love,\" and looked so contrite and honest that,\nas rapidly as it had come upon him, his anger passed.\n\nHe opened his mouth to say something to her. He didn't get it said.\nShe was sitting there, looking at him, alone and soft and inviting.\nHe kissed her; and as she returned the kiss, he kissed her again, and\nagain.\n\nBut less than an hour later he was in her Porsche, cold sober, raging,\nfrustrated, miserable. He slammed it through the unfamiliar gears as he\nsped back to the city.\n\nShe had left him. They had kissed with increasing passion, his hands\nplaying about her, her body surging toward him, and then, just then,\nshe whispered, \"No, love.\" He held her tighter and without another word\nshe opened her eyes and looked at him.\n\nHe knew what mind it was that caught him then. It was her mind.\nStiffly, like wood, he released her, stood up, walked to the door and\nlocked it behind him.\n\nThe lights in the villa went out. He stood there, boiling, looking\ninto the shadows through the great, wide, empty window. He could see\nher lying there on the couch, and as he watched he saw her body toss\nand stir; and as surely as he had ever known anything before he knew\nthat somewhere in the world some woman--or some man!--lay locked with a\nlover, violent in love, and was unable to tell the other that a third\nparty had invaded their bed.\n\nChandler did not know it until he saw something glistening on his\nwrist, but he was weeping on the wild ride back to Honolulu in the car.\nHer car. Would there be trouble for his taking it? God, let there\nbe trouble! He was in a mood for trouble. He was sick and wild with\nrevulsion.\n\nWorse than her use of him, a casual stimulant, an aphrodisiac touch,\nwas that she thought what she did was right. Chandler thought of the\nworshipping dozens under the sundeck of the exec restaurant, and\nRosalie's gracious benediction as they made her their floral offerings.\nBlind, pathetic fools!\n\nNot only the deluded men and women in the garden were worshippers\ntrapped in a vile religion, he thought. It was worse. The gods and\ngoddesses worshipped at their own divinity as well!\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nThree days later Koitska's voice, coming from Chandler's lips, summoned\nhim out to the TWA shack again.\n\nWise now in the ways of this world, Chandler commandeered a police car\nand was hurried out to the South Gate, where the guards allowed him a\ncar of his own. The door of the building was unlocked and Chandler went\nright up.\n\nHe was astonished. The fat man was actually sitting up. He was fully\ndressed--more or less; incongruously he wore flowered shorts and a\nbright red, short-sleeve shirt, with rope sandals. He said, \"You fly\na _gilikopter_? No? No difference. Help me.\" An arm like a mountain\nwent over Chandler's shoulders. The man must have weighed three hundred\npounds. Slowly, wheezing, he limped toward the back of the room and\ntouched a button.\n\nA door opened.\n\nChandler had not known before that there was an elevator in the\nbuilding. That was one of the things the exec did not consider\nimportant for his slaves to know. It lowered them with great grace and\ndelicacy to the first floor, where a large old Cadillac, ancient but\nimmaculately kept, the kind that used to be called a \"gangster's car,\"\nwaited in a private parking bay.\n\nChandler followed Koitska's directions and drove to an airfield where\na small, Plexiglas-nosed helicopter waited. More by the force of\nChandler pushing him from behind than through his own fat thighs,\nKoitska puffed up the little staircase into the cabin. Originally the\ncopter had been fitted for four passengers. Now there was the pilot's\nseat and a seat beside it, and in the back a wide, soft couch. Koitska\ncollapsed onto it. His face blanked out--he was, Chandler knew,\nsomewhere else, just then.\n\nIn a moment his eyes opened again. He looked at Chandler with no\ninterest at all, and turned his face to the wall.\n\nAfter a moment he wheezed. \"Sit down. At de controls.\" He breathed\nnoisily for a while. Then, \"It von't pay you to be interested in\nRosalie,\" he said.\n\nChandler was startled. He craned around in the seat but saw only\nKoitska's back. \"I'm not! Or anyway--\" But he had no place to go in\nthat sentence, and in any case Koitska no longer seemed interested.\n\nAfter a moment Koitska stirred, settled himself more comfortably, and\nChandler felt himself taken. He turned to face the split wheel and the\nunfamiliar pedals and watched himself work the controls. It was an\nadmirable performance. Whoever Chandler was just then--he could not\nguess--he was a first-class helicopter pilot.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey crossed a wide body of ocean and approached another island; from\none quick glance at a navigation map that his eyes had taken, Chandler\nguessed it to be Hilo. He landed the craft expertly on the margin of a\nsmall airstrip, where two DC-3s were already parked and being unloaded,\nand felt himself free again.\n\nTwo husky young men, apparently native Hawaiians by their size, rolled\nup a ramp and assisted Koitska down it and into a building. Chandler\nwas left to his own devices. The building was rundown but sound. Around\nit stalky grass clumped, long uncut, and a few mauve and scarlet\nblossoms, almost hidden, showed where someone had once tended beds of\nbougainvillea and poinsettias. He could not guess what the building\nhad been doing there, looking like a small office-factory combination\nout in the remote wilds, until he caught sight of a sign the winds had\nblown against a wall: _Dole_. Apparently this had been headquarters\nfor one of the plantations. Now it was stripped almost clean inside, a\nwelter of desks and rusted machines piled heedlessly where there once\nhad been a parking lot. New equipment was being loaded into it from the\ncargo planes. Chandler recognized some of it as from the list he had\ngiven the parts man, Hsi. There also seemed to be a gasoline-driven\ngenerator--a large one--but what the other things were he could not\nguess.\n\nBesides Koitska, there were at least five coronet-wearing execs visible\naround the place. Chandler was not surprised. It would have to be\nsomething big to winkle these torpid slugs out of their shells, but he\nknew what it was, and that it was big enough to them indeed; in fact,\nit was their lives. He deduced that Koitska's plans for his future\ncomfort required a standby transmitter to service the coronets, in case\nsomething went wrong. And clearly it was this that they were to put\ntogether here.\n\nFor ten hours, while the afternoon became dark night, they worked\nat a furious pace. When the sun set one of the execs gestured and\nthe generator was started, rocking on its rubber-tired wheels as its\nrotors spun and fumes chugged out, and they worked on by strings of\nincandescent lights. It was pick-and-shovel work for Chandler, no\nengineering, just unloading and roughly grouping the equipment where\nit was ready to be assembled. The execs did not take part in the work.\nNor were they idle. They busied themselves in one room of the building\nwith some small device--Chandler could not see what--and when he looked\nagain it was gone. He did not see them take it away and did not know\nwhere it was taken. Toward midnight he suddenly realized that it was\nlikely some essential part which they would not permit anyone but\nthemselves to handle, and that, no doubt, was why they had come in\nperson, instead of working through proxies.\n\nJust before they left Koitska and two or three of the other execs\nquizzed him briefly. He was too tired to think beyond the questions,\nbut they seemed to be trying to find out if he was able to do the\nsimpler parts of the construction without supervision, and they seemed\nsatisfied with the answers. He flew the helicopter home, with someone\nelse guilding his arms and legs, but he was half asleep as he did it,\nand he never quite remembered how he managed to get back to his room at\nTripler.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe next morning he went back to Parts 'n Plenty with an additional\nlist, covering replacement of some parts that had been damaged. Hsi\nglanced at it quickly and nodded. \"All this stuff I have. You can pick\nit up this afternoon if you like.\"\n\nChandler offered him a cigarette out of a stale pack. \"About the other\nnight--\"\n\nHsi began to perspire, but he said, casually enough, \"Interested in\nbaseball?\"\n\n\"Baseball?\"\n\nHsi said, as though there had been nothing incongruous about the\nquestion, \"There'll be a Little League game this afternoon. Back of the\nschool on Punahou and Wilder. I thought I might stop by, then we can\ncome back and pick up the rest of your gear. Two o'clock. Hope I'll see\nyou.\"\n\nChandler walked away thoughtfully. He had no real intention of going\nthere, but something in Hsi's attitude suggested more than a ball game;\nafter a quick and poor lunch he decided to go.\n\nThe field was a dirty playground, scuffed out of what had probably\nonce been an attractive campus. The players were ten-year-olds, of the\nmixture of hair colors and complexions typical of the islands. Chandler\nwas puzzled. Surely even the wildest baseball rooter wouldn't go far\nout of his way for this, and yet there was an audience of at least\nfifty adults watching the game. And none seemed to be related to the\nballplayers. The Little Leaguers played grave, careful ball, and the\naudience watched them without a word of parental encouragement or joy.\n\nHsi approached him from the shadow of the school building. \"Glad you\ncould make it, Chandler. No, no questions. Just watch.\"\n\nIn the fifth inning, with the score aggregating around thirty, there\nwas an interruption. A tall, red-headed man glanced at his watch,\nlicked his lips, took a deep breath and walked out onto the diamond. He\nglanced at the crowd, while the kids suspended play without surprise.\nThen the red-headed man nodded to the umpire and stepped off the field.\nThe ballplayers resumed their game, but now the whole attention of the\naudience was on the red-headed man.\n\nSuspicion crossed Chandler's mind. In a moment it was confirmed, as the\nred-headed man raised his hands waist high and clasped his right hand\naround his left wrist--only for a moment, but that was enough.\n\nThe ball game was a cover. Chandler was present at a meeting of what\nHsi had called The Society of Slaves, the underground that dared to pit\nitself against the execs.\n\nHsi cleared his throat and said, \"This is the one. I vouch for him.\"\nAnd that was startling too, Chandler thought, because all these\nwrist-circled men and women were looking at _him_.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"All right,\" said the red-headed man nervously, \"let's get started\nthen. First thing, anybody got any weapons? Sure? Take a look--we don't\nwant any slipups. Turn out your pockets.\"\n\nThere was a flurry and a woman near Chandler held up a key ring with a\ntiny knife on it \"Penknife? Hell, yes; get rid of it. Throw it in the\noutfield. You can pick it up after the meeting.\" A hundred eyes watched\nthe pearly object fly. \"We ought to be all right here,\" said the\nred-headed man. \"The kids have been playing every day this week and\nnobody looked in. But _watch your neighbor_. See anything suspicious,\ndon't wait. Don't take a chance. Holler 'Kill the umpire!' or anything\nyou like, but holler. Good and loud.\" He paused, breathing hard. \"All\nright, Hsi. Introduce him.\"\n\nThe parts man took Chandler firmly by the shoulder. \"This fellow\nhas something for us,\" he said. \"He's working for the exec Koitska,\nbuilding what can't be anything else but a duplicate of the machine\nthat they use to control us. He--\"\n\n\"Wait a minute!\" A bearded man came forward and peered furiously into\nChandler's face. \"Look at his head! Don't you see he's branded?\"\n\nChandler touched his scar as the man with the beard hissed, \"Damned\nhoaxer! This is the lowest species of life on the face of the\nearth--someone who pretended to be possessed in order to do some damned\ndirty act What was it, hoaxer? Murder? Burning babies alive?\"\n\nHsi economically let go of Chandler's shoulder, half turned the bearded\nman with one hand and swung with the other. \"Shut up, Linton. Wait till\nyou hear what he's got for us.\"\n\nThe bearded man, sprawling and groggy, slowly rose as Hsi explained\ntersely what he had guessed of Chandler's work--as much as Chandler\nhimself knew, it seemed. \"Maybe this is only a duplicate. Maybe it\nwon't be used. But maybe it will--and Chandler's the man who can\nsabotage it! How would you like that? The execs switching over to\nthis equipment while the other one is down for maintenance--and their\nheadsets don't work!\"\n\nThere was a terrible silence, except for the sounds of the children\nplaying ball. Two runs had just scored. Chandler recognized the\nsilence. It was hope.\n\nLinton broke it, his blue eyes gleaming above the beard. \"No! Better\nthan that. Why wait? We can _use_ this fellow's machine. Set it up, get\nus some headsets--and we can control the execs themselves!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe silence was even longer; then there was a babble of discussion, but\nChandler did not take part in it. He was thinking. It was a tremendous\nthought.\n\nSuppose a man like himself were actually able to do what they wanted\nof him. Never mind the practical difficulties--learning how it worked,\ngetting a headset, bypassing the traps Koitska would surely have set\nto prevent just that. Never mind the penalties for failure. Suppose\nhe could make it work, and find fifty headsets, and fit them to the\nfifty men and women here in this clandestine meeting of the Society of\nSlaves....\n\nWould there, after all, be any change worth mentioning in the state of\nthe world?\n\nOr was Lord Acton, always and everywhere, right? Power corrupts.\nAbsolute power corrupts absolutely. The power locked in the coronets\nof the exec was more than flesh and blood could stand; he could almost\nsense the rot in those near him at the mere thought.\n\nBut Hsi was throwing cold water on the idea. \"Sorry, but I know that\nmuch: One exec can't control another. The headpieces insulate against\ncontrol. Well.\" He glanced at his watch. \"We agreed on twenty minutes\nmaximum for this meeting,\" he reminded the red-headed man, who nodded.\n\n\"You're right.\" He glanced around the group. \"I'll make the rest of it\nfast. News: You all know they got some more of us last week. Have you\nall been by the Monument? Three of our comrades were still there this\nmorning. But I don't think they know we're organized, they think it's\nonly individual acts of sabotage. In case any of you don't know, the\nexecs can't read our minds. Not even when they're controlling us. Proof\nis we're all still alive. Hanrahan knew practically every one of us,\nand he's been lying out there for a week with a broken back, ever since\nthey caught him trying to blow up the guard pits at East Gate. They had\nplenty of chance to pump him if they could. _They can't._ Next thing.\nNo more individual attacks on one exec. Not unless it's a matter of\nlife and death, and even then you're wasting your time unless you've\ngot a gun. They can grab your mind faster than you can cut a throat.\nThird thing: Don't get the idea there are good execs and bad execs.\nOnce they put that thing on their heads they're all the same. Fourth\nthing. You can't make deals. They aren't that worried. So if anybody's\nthinking of selling out--I'm not saying anyone is--forget it.\" He\nlooked around. \"Anything else?\"\n\n\"What about germ warfare in the water supply?\" somebody ventured.\n\n\"Still looking into it. No report yet. All right, that's enough for\nnow. Meeting's adjourned. Watch the ball game for a while, then drift\naway. _One at a time._\"\n\nHsi was the first to go, then a couple of women together, then a\nsprinkling of other men. Chandler was in no particular hurry, although\nit seemed time to leave anyway, because the ball game appeared to be\nover. A ten-year-old with freckles on his face was at the plate, but\nhe was leaning on his bat, staring at Chandler with wide, serious eyes.\n\nChandler felt a sudden chill.\n\nHe turned, began to walk away--and felt himself seized.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe walked slowly into the schoolhouse, unable to look around. Behind\nhim he heard a confused sob, tears and a child's voice trying to\nblubber through: \"Something _funny_ happened.\"\n\nIf the child had been an adult it might have been warning enough. But\nthe child had never experienced possession before, was not sure enough,\nwas clear into the schoolhouse before the remaining members of the\nSociety of Slaves awoke to their danger. He heard a quick cry of _They\ngot him!_ Then Chandler's legs stopped walking and he addressed himself\nsavagely. A few yards away a stout Chinese lady was mopping the tiles;\nshe looked up at him, startled, but no more startled than Chandler was\nhimself. \"You idiot!\" Chandler blazed. \"Why do you have to get mixed\nup in this? Don't you know it's wrong, love? Stay here!\" Chandler\ncommanded himself. \"Don't you _dare_ leave this building!\"\n\nAnd he was free again, but there was a sudden burst of screams from\noutside.\n\nBewildered, Chandler stood for a moment, as little able to move as\nthough the girl still had him under control. Then he leaped through a\nclassroom to a window, staring. Outside in the playground there was\nwild confusion. Half the spectators were on the ground, trying to rise.\nAs he watched, a teen-age boy hurled himself at an elderly lady, the\ntwo of them falling. Another man flung himself to the ground. A woman\nswung her pocketbook into the face of the man next to her. One of the\nfallen ones rose, only to trip himself again. It was a mad spectacle,\nbut Chandler understood it: What he was watching was a single member\nof the exec trying to keep a group of twenty ordinary, unarmed human\nbeings in line. The exec was leaping from mind to mind; even so, the\ncrowd was beginning to scatter.\n\nWithout thought Chandler started to leap out to help them; but the\npossessor had anticipated that. He was caught at the door. He whirled\nand ran toward the woman with the mop; as he was released, the woman\nflung herself upon him, knocking him down.\n\nBy the time he was able to get up again it was far too late to help ...\nif there ever had been a time when he could have been of any real help.\n\nHe heard shots. Two policeman had come running into the playground,\nwith guns drawn.\n\nThe exec who had looked at him out of the boy's eyes, who had\npenetrated this nest of enemies and extricated Chandler from it, had\ntaken first things first. Help had been summoned. Quick as the coronets\nworked, it was no time at all until the nearest persons with weapons\nwere located, commandeered and in action.\n\nTwo minutes later there no longer was resistance.\n\nObviously more execs had come to help, attracted by the commotion\nperhaps, or summoned at some stolen moment after the meeting had first\nbeen invaded. There were only five survivors on the field. Each was\nclearly controlled. They rose and stood patiently while the two police\nshot them, shot them, paused to reload and shot again. The last to die\nwas the bearded man, Linton, and as he fell his eyes brushed Chandler's.\n\nChandler leaned against a wall.\n\nIt had been a terrible sight. The nearness of his own death had been\nalmost the least of it.\n\nHe had no doubt of the identity of the exec who had saved him and\ndestroyed the others. Though he had heard the voice only as it came\nfrom his own mouth, he could not miss it. It was Rosalie Pan.\n\nHe looked out at the red-headed man, sprawled across the foul line\nbehind third base, and remembered what he had said. There weren't any\ngood execs or bad execs. There were only execs.\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\n\nWhatever Chandler's life might be worth, he knew he had given it away\nand the girl had given it back to him.\n\nHe did not see her for several days, but the morning after the massacre\nhe woke to find a note beside his bed table. No one had been in the\nroom. It was his own sleeping hand that had written it, though the\ngirl's mind had moved his fingers:\n\n    If you get mixed up in anything like that again I won't be able to\n    help you. So don't! Those people are just using you, you know.\n    Don't throw away your chances. Do you like surfboarding?\n\n    Rosie\n\nBut by then there was no time for surfboarding, or for anything\nelse but work. The construction job on Hilo had begun, and it was a\nnightmare. He was flown to the island with the last load of parts. No\nexecs were present in the flesh, but in the first day Chandler lost\ncount of how many different minds possessed his own. He began to be\nable to recognize them by a limp as he walked, by tags of German as he\nspoke, by a stutter, a distinctive gesture of annoyance, an expletive.\nAs he was a trained engineer he was left to labor by himself for hours\non end. It was worse for the others. There seemed to be a dozen execs\nhovering invisible around all the time; no sooner was a worker released\nby one than he was seized by another. The work progressed rapidly,\nbut at the cost of utter exhaustion. By the end of the fourth day\nChandler had eaten only two meals and could not remember when he had\nslept last. He found himself staggering when free, and furious with the\nfatigue-clumsiness of his own body when possessed. At sundown on the\nfourth day he found himself free for a moment and, incredibly, without\nwork of his own to do just then, until someone else completed a job\nof patchwiring. He stumbled out into the open air and had time only\nto gaze around for a moment before his eyes began to close. This must\nonce have been a lovely island. Even unkempt as it was, the trees were\ntall and beautiful. Beyond them a wisp of smoke was pale against the\ndark-blue evening sky; the breeze was scented.... He woke and found he\nwas already back in the building, reaching for his soldering gun.\n\nThere came a point at which even the will of the execs was unable to\ndrive the flogged bodies farther, and then they were permitted to sleep\nfor a few hours. At daybreak they were awake again. The sleep was not\nenough. The bodies were slow and inaccurate. Two of the Hawaiians,\nstraining a hundred-pound component into place, staggered, slipped--and\ndropped it.\n\nAppalled, Chandler waited for them to kill themselves.\n\nBut it seemed that the execs were tiring too. One of the Hawaiians said\nirritably, with an accent Chandler did not recognize: \"That's pau. All\nright, you morons, you've won yourselves a vacation; we'll have to fly\nyou in replacements. Take the day off.\" And incredibly all eleven of\nthe haggard wrecks stumbling around the building were free at once.\n\nThe first thought of every man was to eat, to relieve himself, to\nremove a shoe and ease a blistered foot--to do any of the things they\nhad not been permitted to do. The second thought was sleep.\n\nChandler dropped off at once, but he was overtired; he slept fitfully,\nand after an hour or two of turning on the hard ground sat up, blinking\nred-eyed around. He had been slow. The cushioned seats in the aircraft\nand cars were already taken. He stood up, stretched, scratched himself\nand wondered what to do next, and he remembered the thread of smoke he\nhad seen--when? three nights ago?--against the evening sky.\n\nIn all those hours he had not had time to think one obvious thought:\nThere should have been no smoke there! The island was supposed to be\ndeserted.\n\nHe stood up, looked around to get his bearings, and started off in the\ndirection he remembered.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was good to own his body again, in poor condition as it was. It was\ndelicious to be allowed to think consecutive thoughts.\n\nThe chemistry of the human animal is such that it heals whatever\nthrusts it may receive from the outside world. Short of death, its\nonly incapacitating wound comes from itself; from the outside it can\nsurvive astonishing blows, rise again and flourish. Chandler was not\nflourishing, but he had begun to rise.\n\nTime had been so compressed and blurred in the days since the slaughter\nat the Punahou School that he had not had time to grieve over the\ndeaths of his briefly-met friends, or even to think of their quixotic\nplans against the execs. Now he began to wonder.\n\nHe understood with what thrill of hope he had been received--a man like\nthemselves, not an exec, whose touch was at the very center of the exec\npower. But how firm was that touch? Was there really anything he could\ndo?\n\nIt seemed not. He barely understood the mechanics of what he was\ndoing, far less the theory behind it. Conceivably knowing where this\ninstallation was he could somehow get back to it when it was completed.\nIn theory it might be that there was a way to dispense with the\nheadsets and exert power from the big board itself.\n\nA Cro-Magnard at the controls of a nuclear-laden jet bomber could\ndestroy a city. Nothing stopped him. Nothing but his own invincible\nignorance. Chandler was that Cro-Magnard; certainly power was here to\ngrasp, but he had no way of knowing how to pick it up.\n\nStill--where there was life there was hope. He decided he was wasting\ntime that would not come again. He had been wandering along a road\nthat led into a small town, quite deserted, but this was no time for\nwandering. His place was back at the installation, studying, scheming,\ntrying to understand all he could. He began to turn, and stopped.\n\n\"Great God,\" he said softly, looking at what he had just seen. The\ntown was deserted of life, but not of death.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere were bodies everywhere.\n\nThey were long dead, perhaps years. They seemed natural and right as\nthey lay there. It was not surprising they had escaped his notice at\nfirst. Little was left but bones and an occasional desiccated leathery\nrag that might have been a face. The clothing was faded and rotted\naway; but enough was left of the bodies and the clothes to make it\nclear that none of these people had died natural deaths. A rusted blade\nin a chest cage showed where a knife had pierced a heart; a small\nskull near his feet (with a scrap of faded blue rompers near it) was\nshattered. On a flagstone terrace a family group of bones lay radiating\noutward, like a rosette. Something had exploded there and caught them\nall as they turned to flee. There was a woman's face, grained like oak\nand eyeless, visible between the fender of a truck and a crushed-in\nwall.\n\nLike exhumed Pompeii, the tragedy was so ancient that it aroused only\nwonder. The whole town had been blotted out.\n\nThe execs did not take chances; apparently they had sterilized the\nwhole island--probably had sterilized all of them except Oahu itself,\nto make certain that their isolation was complete, except for the\ncaptive stock allowed to breed and serve them in and around Honolulu.\n\nChandler prowled the town for a quarter of an hour, but one street was\nlike another. The bodies did not seem to have been disturbed even by\nanimals, but perhaps there were none big enough to show traces of such\nwork.\n\nSomething moved in a doorway.\n\nChandler thought at once of the smoke he had seen, but no one answered\nhis call and, though he searched, he could neither see nor hear\nanything alive.\n\nThe search was a waste of time. It also wasted his best chance to study\nthe thing he was building. As he returned to the cinder-block structure\nat the end of the airstrip he heard motors and looked up to see a plane\ncircling in for a landing.\n\nHe knew that he had only a few minutes. He spent those minutes as\nthriftily as he could, but long before he could even grasp the\ncircuitry of the parts he had not himself worked on he felt a touch at\nhis mind. The plane was rolling to a stop. He and all of them hurried\nover to begin unloading it.\n\nThe plane was stopped with one wingtip almost touching the building,\nheading directly into it--convenient for unloading, but a foolish\nnuisance when it came time to turn it and take off again, Chandler's\nmind thought while his body lugged cartons out of the plane.\n\nBut he knew the answer to that. Takeoff would be no problem, any more\nthan it would for the other small transports at the far end of the\nstrip.\n\nThese planes were not going to return, ever.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe work went on, and then it was done, or all but, and Chandler knew\nno more about it than when it was begun. The last little bit was a\ncareful check of line voltages and a balancing of biases. Chandler\ncould help only up to a point, and then two execs, working through the\nbodies of one of the Hawaiians and the pilot of a Piper Tri-Pacer who\nhad flown in some last-minute test equipment--and remained as part of\nthe labor pool--laboriously worked on the final tests.\n\nSpent, the other men flopped to the ground, waiting.\n\nThey were far gone. All of them, Chandler as much as the others. But\none of them rolled over, grinned tightly at Chandler and said, \"It's\nbeen fun. My name's Bradley. I always think people ought to know each\nother's names in cases like this. Imagine sharing a grave with some\nutter stranger!\"\n\n\"Grave?\"\n\nBradley nodded. \"Like Pharaoh's slaves. The pyramid is just about\nfinished, friend. You don't know what I'm talking about?\" He sat up,\nplucked a blade of stemmy grass and put it between his teeth. \"I guess\nyou haven't seen the corpses in the woods.\"\n\nChandler said, \"I found a town half a mile or so over there, nothing in\nit but skeletons.\"\n\n\"No, heavens, nothing that ancient. These are nice fresh corpses, out\nbehind the junkheap there. Well, not _fresh_. They're a couple of weeks\nold. I thought it was neat of the execs to dispose of the used-up labor\nout of sight of the rest of us. So much better for morale ... until\nJuan Simoa and I went back looking for a plain, simple electrical\nextension cord and found them.\"\n\nWith icy calm Chandler realized that the man was talking sense. Used-up\nlabor: the men who had unloaded the first planes, no doubt--worked\nuntil they dropped, then efficiently disposed of, as they were so cheap\na commodity that they were not worth the trouble of hauling back to\nHonolulu for salvage. \"I see,\" he said. \"Besides, dead men tell no\ntales.\"\n\n\"_And_ spread no disease. Probably that's why they did their killing\nback in the tall trees. Always the chance some exec might have to come\ndown here to inspect in person. Rotting corpses just aren't sanitary.\"\nBradley grinned again. \"I used to be a doctor at Molokai.\"\n\n\"Lep--\" began Chandler, but the doctor shook his head.\n\n\"No, no, never say 'leprosy.' It's 'Hansen's disease.' Whatever it is,\nthe execs were sure scared of it. They wiped out every patient we had,\nexcept a couple who got away by swimming; then for good measure they\nwiped out most of the medical staff too, except for a couple like me\nwho were off-island and had the sense to keep quiet about where they'd\nworked. I used,\" he said, rolling over his back and putting his hands\nbehind his head, \"in the old days to work on pest-control for the\nPublic Health Service. We sure knocked off a lot of rats and fleas. I\nnever thought I'd be one of them.\" He was silent.\n\nChandler admired his courage very much. The man had fallen asleep.\n\nChandler looked at the others. \"You going to let them kill us without a\nstruggle?\" he demanded.\n\nThe remaining Hawaiian was the only one to answer. He said, \"You just\ndon't know how much _pilikia_ you're in. It isn't what we _let_ them\ndo.\"\n\n\"We'll see,\" Chandler promised grimly. \"They're only human. I haven't\ngiven up yet.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut in the end he could not save himself; it was the girl who saved\nhim. That night Chandler tossed in troubled sleep, and woke to find\nhimself standing, walking toward the Tri-Pacer. The sun was just\nbeginning to pink the sky and no one else was moving. \"Sorry, love,\"\nhe apologized to himself. \"You probably need to bathe and shave, but\nI don't know how. Shave, I mean.\" He giggled. \"Anyway, you'll find\neverything you need at my house.\"\n\nHe climbed into the plane. \"Ever fly before?\" he asked himself. \"Well,\nyou'll love it. Here we go. _Close_ the door ... _snap_ the belt ...\n_turn_ the switch.\" He admired the practiced ease with which his body\nstarted the motor, raced it with a critical eye on the instruments,\nturned the plane and lifted it off, up, into the rising sun.\n\n\"Oh, dear. You _do_ need a bath,\" he told himself, wrinkling his nose\nhumorously. \"No harm. I've the nicest tub--pink, deep--and nine kinds\nof bath salts. But I wish you weren't so tired, love, because it's\na long flight and you're wearing me out.\" He was silent as he bent\nto the correct compass heading and cranked a handle over his head to\nadjust the trim. \"Koitska's going to be so _huhu_,\" he said, smiling.\n\"Never fear, love, I can calm him down. But it's easier to do with you\nin one piece, you know, the other way's too late.\"\n\nHe was silent for a long time, and then his voice began to sing.\n\nThey were songs from Rosalie's own musical comedies. Even with so poor\nan instrument as Chandler's voice to work with, she sang well enough to\nkeep both of them entertained while his body brought the plane in for\na landing; and so Chandler went to live in the villa that belonged to\nRosalie Pan.\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\n\n\"Love,\" she said, \"there are worse things in the world than keeping me\namused when I'm not busy. We'll go to the beach again one day soon, I\npromise.\" And she was gone again.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nChandler was a concubine--not even that; he was a male geisha,\nconvenient to play gin rummy with, or for company on the surfboards, or\nto make a drink.\n\nHe did not quite know what to make of himself. In bad times one hopes\nfor survival. He had hoped; and now he had survival, perfumed and\ncushioned, but on what mad terms! Rosalie was a pretty girl, and a\ngood-humored one. She was right. There were worse things in the world\nthan being her companion; but Chandler could not adjust himself to the\nrole.\n\nIt angered him when she got up from the garden swing and locked herself\nin her room--for he knew that she was not sleeping as she lay there,\nthough her eyes were closed and she was motionless. It infuriated him\nwhen she casually usurped his body to bring an ashtray to her side, or\nto stop him when his hands presumed. And it drove him nearly wild to be\na puppet with her friends working his strings.\n\nHe was that most of all. One exec who wished to communicate with\nanother cast about for an available human proxy nearby. Chandler\nwas that for Rosalie Pan: her telephone, her social secretary, and on\noccasion he was the garment her dates put on. For Rosalie was one\nof the few execs who cared to conduct any major part of her life in\nher own skin. She liked dancing. She enjoyed dining out. It was her\npleasure to display herself to the worshippers at Luigi the Wharf Rat's\nand to speed down the long combers on a surfboard. When another exec\nchose to accompany her it was Chandler's body which gave the remote\n\"date\" flesh.\n\nHe ate very well indeed--in surprising variety. He drank heavily\nsometimes and abstained others. Once, in the person of a Moroccan exec,\nhe smoked an opium pipe; once he dined on roasted puppy. He saw many\ninteresting things and, when Rosalie was occupied without him, he had\nthe run of her house, her music library, her pantry and her books. He\nwas not mistreated. He was pampered and praised, and every night she\nkissed him before she retired to her own room with the snap-lock on the\ndoor.\n\nHe was miserable.\n\nHe prowled the house in the nights after she had left him, unable\nto sleep. It had been bad enough on Hilo, under the hanging threat\nof death. But then, though he was only a slave, he was working at\nsomething that used his skill and training.\n\nNow? Now a Pekingese could do nearly all she wanted of him. He despised\nin himself the knowledge that with a Pekingese's cunning he was\ncontriving to make himself indispensable to her--her slippers fetched\nin his teeth, his silky mane by her hand to stroke--if not these things\nin actuality, then their very near equivalents.\n\nBut what else was there for him?\n\nThere was nothing. She had spared his life from Koitska, and if he\noffended her, Koitska's sentence would be carried out.\n\nEven dying might be better than this, he thought.\n\nIndeed, it might be better even to go back to Honolulu and life.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the morning he woke to find himself climbing the wide, carpeted\nsteps to her room. She was not asleep; it was her mind that was guiding\nhim.\n\nHe opened the door. She lay with a feathery coverlet pulled up to her\nchin, eyes open, head propped on three pillows; as she looked at him he\nwas free. \"Something the matter, love? You fell asleep sitting up.\"\n\n\"Sorry.\" She would not be put off. She made him tell her his\nresentments. She was very understanding and very sure as she said,\n\"You're not a dog, love. I won't have you thinking that way. You're\nmy friend. Don't you think I need a friend?\" She leaned forward. Her\nnightgown was very sheer; but Chandler had tasted that trap before and\nhe averted his eyes. \"You think it's all fun for us. I understand. Tell\nme, if you thought I was doing important work--oh, _crucial_ work,\nlove--would you feel a little easier? Because I am. We've got the\nwhole work of the island to do, and I do my share. We've got our plans\nto make and our future to provide for. There are so few of us. A single\nH-bomb could kill us all. Do you think it isn't work, keeping that bomb\nfrom ever coming here? There's all Honolulu to monitor, for they know\nabout us there. We can't like some disgusting nitwits like your Society\nof Slaves destroy _us_. There's the problems of the world to see to.\nWhy,\" she said with pride, \"we've solved the whole Indian-Pakistani\npopulation problem in the last two months. They'll not have to worry\nabout famine again for a dozen generations! We're working on China now;\nnext Japan; next--oh, all the world. We'll have three-quarters of the\nlumps gone soon, and the rest will have space to breathe in. It's work!\"\n\nShe saw his expression and said earnestly, \"No, don't think that! You\ncall it murder. It is, of course. But it's the surgeon's knife. We're\nquicker and less painful than starvation, love ... and if some of us\nenjoy the work of weeding out the unfit, does that change anything? It\ndoes not! I admit some of us are, well, _mean_. But not all. And we're\nimproving. The new people we take in are better than the old.\"\n\nShe looked at him thoughtfully for a moment.\n\nThen she shook her head. \"Never mind,\" she said--apparently to herself.\n\"Forget it, love. Go like an angel and fetch us both some coffee.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLike an angel he went ... not, he thought bitterly, like a man.\n\nShe was keeping something from him, and he was too stubborn to let her\ntease him out of his mood. \"Everything's a secret,\" he complained, and\nshe patted his cheek.\n\n\"It has to be that way.\" She was quite serious. \"This is the biggest\nthing in the world. I'm fond of you, love, but I can't let that\ninterfere with my duty.\"\n\n\"_Shto, Rosie?_\" said Chandler's mouth thickly.\n\n\"Oh, there you are, Andrei,\" she said, and spoke quickly in Russian.\n\nChandler's brows knotted in a scowl and he barked: \"_Nyeh mozhet bit!_\"\n\n\"Andrei....\" she said gently. \"_Ya vas sprashnivayoo...._\"\n\n\"_Nyet!_\"\n\n\"_No Andrei...._\"\n\nRumble, grumble; Chandler's body twitched and fumed. He heard his own\nname in the argument, but what the subject matter was he could not\ntell. Rosalie was coaxing; Koitska was refusing. But he was weakening.\nAfter minutes Chandler's shoulders shrugged; he nodded; and he was\nfree.\n\n\"Have some more coffee, love,\" said Rosalie Pan with an air of triumph.\n\nChandler waited. He did not understand what was going on. It was up to\nher to enlighten him, and finally she smiled and said: \"Perhaps you can\njoin us, love. Don't say yes or no. It isn't up to you ... and besides\nyou can't know whether you want it or not until you try. So be patient\na moment.\"\n\nChandler frowned; then felt his body taken. His lips barked:\n\"_Khorashaw!_\" His body got up and walked to the wall of Rosalie's\nroom. A picture on the wall moved aside and there was a safe. Flick,\nflick, Chandler's own fingers dialed a combination so rapidly that he\ncould not follow it. The door of the safe opened.\n\nAnd Chandler was free, and Rosalie excitedly leaping out of the bed\nbehind him, careless of the wisp of nylon that was her only garment,\ncrowding softly, warmly past him to reach inside the safe. She lifted\nout a coronet very like her own.\n\nShe paused and looked at Chandler.\n\n\"You can't do anything to harm us with this one, love,\" she warned.\n\"Do you understand that? I mean, don't get the idea that you can tell\nanyone anything. Or do something violent. You can't. I'll be right\nwith you, and Koitska will be monitoring the transmitter.\" She handed\nhim the coronet. \"Now, when you see something interesting, you move\nright in. You'll see how. It's the easiest thing in the world, and--Oh,\nhere. Put it on.\"\n\nChandler swallowed with difficulty.\n\nShe was offering him the tool that had given the execs the world. A\nblunter, weaker tool than her own, no doubt. But still it was power\nbeyond his imagining. He stood there frozen as she slipped it on his\nhead. Sprung electrodes pressed gently against his temples and behind\nhis ears. She touched something....\n\nChandler stood motionless for a moment and then, without effort,\nfloated free of his own body.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFloating. Floating; a jellyfish floating. Trailing tentacles that\nwhipped and curled, floating over the sandbound claws and chitin that\nclashed beneath, floating over the world's people, and them not even\nknowing, not even seeing....\n\nChandler floated.\n\nHe was up, out and away. He was drifting. Around him was no-color.\nHe saw nothing of space or size, he only saw, or did not see but\nfelt-smelled-tasted, people. They were the sandbound. They were the\ncreatures that crawled and struggled below, and his tentacles lashed\nout at them.\n\nBeside him floated another. The girl? It had a shape, but not a human\nshape--a pair of great projecting spheres, a cinctured area-rule shape.\nFemale. Yes, undoubtedly the girl. It waved a member at him and he\nunderstood he was beckoned. He followed.\n\nTwo of sandbound ones were ahead.\n\nThe female shape slipped into one, he into the other. It was as easy to\ninvest this form with his own will as it was to command the muscles of\nhis hand. They looked at each other out of sandbound eyes. \"You're a\nboy!\" Chandler laughed. The girl laughed: \"You're an old washerwoman!\"\nThey were in a kitchen where fish simmered on an electric stove. The\nboy-Rosie wrinkled his-her nose, blinked and was empty. Only the small\nalmond-eyed boy was left, and he began to cry convulsively. Chandler\nunderstood. He floated out after her.\n\nThis way, this way, she gestured. A crowd of mudbound figures. She\nslipped into one, he into another. They were in a bus now, rocking\nalong an inland road, all men, all roughly dressed. Laborers going\nto clear a new section of Oahu of its split-level debris, Chandler\nthought, and looked for the girl in one of the men's eyes, could not\nfind her, hesitated and--floated. She was hovering impatiently. This\nway!\n\nHe followed, and followed.\n\nThey were a hundred people doing a hundred things. They lingered a\nfew moments as a teen-age couple holding hands in the twilight of the\nbeach. They fled from a room where Chandler was an old woman dying on\na bed, and Rosalie a stolid, uncaring nurse beside her. They played\nfollow-the-leader through the audience of a Honolulu movie theater, and\nsought each other, laughing, among the fish stalls of King Street. Then\nChandler turned to Rosalie to speak and ... it all went out ... the\nscene disappeared ... he opened his eyes, and he was back in his own\nflesh.\n\nHe was lying on the pastel pile rug in Rosalie's bedroom.\n\nHe got up, rubbing the side of his face. He had tumbled, it seemed.\nRosalie was lying on the bed.\n\nIn a moment she opened her eyes.\n\n\"Well, love?\"\n\nHe said hoarsely, \"What made it stop?\"\n\nShe shrugged. \"Koitska turned you off. Tired of monitoring us, I\nexpect--it's been an hour. I'm surprised his patience lasted this\nlong.\"\n\nShe stretched luxuriously, but he was too full of what had happened\neven to see the white grace of her body. \"Did you like it, love? Would\nyou like to have it forever?\"\n\n\n\n\nXIII\n\n\nFor nine days Chandler's status remained in limbo. He spent that day\nin a state of numb bemusement, remembering the men and women he had\nworn like garments, appalled and exhilarated. He did not see Rosalie\nagain that day, she kept to her room and he locked out. He was still a\nlapdog, but a lapdog with a dream dangling before him. He went to sleep\nthat night thinking that he was a dog who might become a god, and he\nhad eight days left.\n\nThe next day Rosalie wheedled another hour of the coronet from Koitska.\nThey explored the ice caves on Mount Rainier in the bodies of two\nsick, starving hermits and wandered arm in arm near the destroyed\nInternational Bridge at Niagara, breathing the spray of the unchanging\nFalls. He had seven days left.\n\nThey passed like a dream. He saw a great deal of the inner workings\nof the exec, more than before. He had privileges. He was up for\nmembership in the club. Rosalie had proposed him. He talked with two\nCzechoslovakian ballet dancers in their persons, and a succession of\nheavily accented Russians and Poles and Japanese through the mouth of\nthe beach boy who came to tend Rosalie's garden. He thought they liked\nhim and was pleased that he penetrated where he had not been allowed\nbefore ... until he realized that these freedoms were in themselves a\nthreat. They allowed him this contact so that they could look him over.\nIf they rejected him they would have to kill him, because he had seen\ntoo much. But by then a week had passed, and another day, and though he\ndid not know it he had only one day left. Rosalie did what she could to\nmake the days of waiting easy for him.\n\n\"Embarrassing, isn't it? I went through it myself, love. Come have a\ndrink.\"\n\n\"When will I know?\" he demanded fretfully.\n\n\"Well.\" She hesitated. \"I don't suppose there's any harm in telling\nyou, love, under the circumstances--\"\n\nHe knew what the circumstances were.\n\n\"I guess I can tell you. You need just over seven hundred votes to\ncome in. You've got--\" Her eyes glazed for a moment. She was looking\nthrough some clerk's eyes, somewhere on the island. \"You've got about a\nhundred and fifty so far. Takes time, doesn't it? But it's worth it in\nthe end.\"\n\n\"How many 'no' votes?\"\n\n\"None.\" She said gently, \"You'll never have but one, love, because\nthat's all it takes.\"\n\nHe stared. The girl gook took up his hand and kissed it lightly. \"One\nblackball's enough, yes, but never fear. Rosie's on your side.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRestlessly Chandler stood up and made himself another drink. His head\nwas beginning to buzz. They had been drinking on her sun terrace since\nearly afternoon.\n\nRosalie came up beside him soothingly. \"I know how you feel. Want me to\ntell you about when I went through it?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" he said, stirring the ice around in the glass and drinking it\ndown. He made another drink absently, hardly hearing what she said,\nalthough the sound of her voice was welcome.\n\n\"Oh, that lousy headdress! It weighed twenty pounds, and they put it on\nwith hatpins.\" He caressed her absently. He had figured out that she\nwas talking about the night New York was bombed. \"I was in the middle\nof the big first-act curtain number when--\" her face was strained,\neven after years, even now that she was herself one of the godlike\nones--\"when something took hold of me. I ran off the stage and right\nout through the front door. There was a cab waiting. As soon as I got\nin I was free, and the driver took off like a lunatic through the\ntunnel, out to Newark Airport. I tell you, I was scared! At the toll\nbooth I screamed but my--friend--let go of the driver for a minute,\nsmashed a trailer-truck into a police car, and in the confusion we got\naway. He took me over again at the airport. I ran bare as a bird into a\nplane that was just ready to take off. The pilot was under control....\nWe flew eleven hours, and I wore that damn feather headdress all the\nway.\"\n\nShe held out her glass for a refill. Chandler busied himself slicing\na lime for her drink. Now she was talking about her friend. \"I hadn't\nseen him in six years. I was just a kid, living in Islip. He was with\na Russian trade commission next door, in an old mansion. Well, he was\none of the ones, back in Russia, that came up with these.\" She touched\nher coronet. \"So,\" she said brightly, \"he put me up for membership and\nby and by they gave me one. You see? It's all very simple, except the\nwaiting.\"\n\nChandler pulled her down on the couch beside him and made a toast.\n\"Your friend.\"\n\n\"He's a nice guy,\" she said moodily, sipping her drink. \"You know how\ncareful I am about getting exercise and so on? It's partly because of\nhim. You would have liked him, love, only--well, it turned out that he\nliked me well enough, but he began to like what he could get through\nthe coronet a lot more. He got fat. A lot of them are awfully fat,\nlove,\" she said seriously. \"That's why they need people like me. And\nyou. Replacements. Heart trouble, liver trouble, what can they expect\nwhen they lie in bed day in and day out, taking their lives through\nother people's bodies? I won't let myself go that way.... It's a\ntemptation. You know, almost every day I find some poor woman on a diet\nand spend a solid hour eating creampuffs and gravies. How they must\nhate me!\"\n\nShe grinned, leaned back and kissed him.\n\nChandler put his arms around the girl and returned the kiss, hard. She\ndid not draw away. She clung to him, and he could feel in the warmth\nof her body, the sound of her breath that she was responding. The\ndrink made him reckless; the last two weeks made him doubtful; he was\ntorn. He could tell that there was no resistance in her body, but the\ncoronet made it in doubt; she could fling him away from her with one\ntouch of the mind. Yet she didn't do it--\n\n\"_Vi myenya zvali?_\" his own voice demanded, harsh and mocking.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe girl tried to push him away. Her eyes were bright and huge, staring\nat him. \"Andrei!\"\n\n\"_Da, Andrei! Kok eto dosadno!_\"\n\n\"Andrei, please. I know that you are--\"\n\n\"Filthy!\" screamed Chandler's voice. \"How can you? I do not allow\nthis carrion to touch you so--not vot is mine--I do not allow him to\nlive!\" And Chandler dropped her and leaped to his feet. He fought. He\nstruggled; but only in his mind, and helplessly; his body carried him\nout of the room, running and stumbling, out into the drive, into her\nwaiting car and away.\n\nHe drove like a madman on roads he had never seen before. The car's\ngears bellowed pain at their abuse, the tires screamed.\n\nChandler, prisoned inside himself, recognized that touch. Koitska! He\nknew who Rosalie Pan's lover had been. If he had been in doubt his own\nvoice, raucous and hysterical with rage, told him the truth. All that\nlong drive it screamed threats and obscenities at him, in Russian and\ntortured English.\n\nThe car stopped in front of the TWA facility and, still prisoned, his\nbody hurried in, bruising itself deliberately against every doorpost\nand stick of furniture. \"I could have smashed you in the car!\" his\nvoice screamed hoarsely. \"It is too merciful. I could have thrown you\ninto the sea! It is not painful enough.\"\n\nIn the garage his body stopped and looked wildly around. \"Knives,\ntorches,\" his lips chanted. \"Shall I gouge out eyes? Slit throat?\"\n\nA jar of battery acid stood on a shelf, \"_Da, da!_\" screamed Chandler,\nstumbling toward it. \"One drink eh? And I von't even stay vith you to\nfeel it, the pain--just a moment--then it eats the gut, the long slow\ndying....\" And all the time the body that was Chandler's was clawing\nthe cap off the jar, tilting it--\n\nHe dropped the jar, and leaped aside instinctively as it splintered at\nhis feet.\n\nHe was free!\n\nBefore he could move he was seized again, stumbled, crashed into a\nwall--\n\nAnd was free again.\n\nHe stood waiting for a moment, unable to believe it; but he was still\nfree. The alien invader did not seize his mind. There was no sound. No\none moved. No gun fired at him, no danger threatened.\n\nHe _was_ free; he took a step, turned, shook his head and proved it.\n\nHe was free and, in a moment, realized that he was in the building with\nthe fat bloated body of the man who wanted to murder him, the body that\nin its own strength could scarcely stand erect.\n\nIt was suicide to attempt to harm an exec. He would certainly lose his\nlife--except--that was gone already anyhow; he had lost it. He had\nnothing left to lose.\n\n\n\n\nXIV\n\n\nChandler loped silently up the stairs to Koitska's suite.\n\nHalfway up he tripped and sprawled, half stunning himself against the\nstair rail. It had not been his own clumsiness, he was sure. Koitska\nhad caught at his mind again, but only feebly. Chandler did not wait.\nWhatever was interfering with Koitska's control, some distraction or\nmalfunction of the coronet or whatever, Chandler could not bank on its\nlasting.\n\nThe door was locked.\n\nHe found a heavy mahogany chair, with a back of solid carved wood. He\nflung it onto his shoulders, grunting, and ran with it into the door,\na bull driven frantic, lunging out of its querencia to batter the wall\nof the arena. The door splintered.\n\nChandler was gashed with long slivers of wood, but he was through the\ndoor.\n\nKoitska lay sprawled along his couch, eyes staring.\n\nAlive or dead? Chandler did not wait to find out but sprang at him\nhands outstreched. The staring eyes flickered; Chandler felt the pull\nat his mind. But Koitska's strength was almost gone. The eyes glazed,\nand Chandler was upon him. He ripped the coronet off and flung it\naside, and the huge bulk of Koitska swung paralytically off the couch\nand fell to the floor.\n\nThe man was helpless. He lay breathing like a steam engine, one eye\npressed shut against the leg of a coffee table, the other looking up at\nChandler.\n\nChandler was panting almost as hard as the helpless mass at his feet.\nHe was safe for a moment. At the most for a moment, for at any time\none of the other execs might dart down out of the mind-world into the\nreal, looking at the scene through Chandler's eyes and surely deducing\nwhat would be no more to his favor than the truth. He had to get away\nfrom there. If he seemed busy in another room perhaps they would go\naway again. Chandler turned his back on the paralyzed monster to flee.\nIt would be even better to try to lose himself in Honolulu--if he\ncould get that far--he did not in his own flesh know how to fly the\nhelicopter that was parked in the yard or he would try to get farther\nstill.\n\nBut as he turned he was caught.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nChandler turned to see Koitska lying there, and screamed.\n\nHis eyes were staring at Koitska. It was too late. He was possessed by\nsomeone, he did not know whom. Though it made little enough difference,\nhe thought, watching his own hands reach out to touch the staring face.\n\nHis body straightened, his eyes looked around the room, he went to the\ndesk. \"Love,\" he cried to himself, \"what's the matter with Koitska?\nWrite, for God's sake!\" And he took a pencil in his hand and was free.\n\nHe hesitated, then scribbled: _I don't know. I think he had a stroke.\nWho are you?_\n\nThe other mind slipped tentatively into his, scanning the paper.\n\"Rosie, you idiot, who did you think?\" he said furiously. \"What have\nyou done?\"\n\n_Nothing_, he began instinctively, then scratched the word out.\nBriskly and exactly he wrote: _He was going to kill me, but he had some\nkind of an attack. I took his coronet away. I was going to run._\n\n\"Oh, you fool,\" he told himself shrilly a moment later. Chandler's\nbody knelt beside the wheezing fat lump, taking its pulse. The faint,\nfitful throb meant nothing to Chandler; probably meant nothing to Rosie\neither, for his body stood up, hesitated, shook its head. \"You've done\nit now,\" he sobbed, and was surprised to find he was weeping real\ntears. \"Oh, love, why? I could have taken care of Koitska--somehow--No,\nmaybe I couldn't,\" he said frantically, breaking down. \"I don't know\nwhat to do. Do you have any ideas--outside of running?\"\n\nIt took him several seconds to write the one word, but it was really\nall he could find to write. _No._\n\nHis lips twisted as his eyes read the word. \"Well,\" he said\npractically, \"I guess that's the end, love. I mean, I give up.\"\n\nHe got up, turned around the room. \"I don't know,\" he told himself\nworriedly. \"There might be a chance--if we could hush this up. I'd\nbetter get a doctor. He'll have to use your body, so don't be surprised\nif there's someone and it isn't me. Maybe he can pull Andrei through.\nMaybe Andrei'll forgive you then--Or if he dies,\" Chandler's voice\nschemed as his eyes stared at the rasping motionless hulk, \"we can say\nyou broke down the door to _help_ him. Only you'll have to put his\ncoronet back on, so it won't look suspicious. Besides that will keep\nanyone from occupying him. Do that, love. Hurry.\" And he was free.\n\nGingerly Chandler crossed the floor.\n\nHe did not like to touch the dying animal that wheezed before him,\nliked even less to give it back the weapon that, if it had only a few\nmoments of sentience again, it would use to kill him. But the girl was\nright. Without the helmet any wandering curi-himself.[1] The helmet\nwould shield him from--\n\n[Footnote 1: Transcriber's note: As printed. Missing words, probably\nprinter error.]\n\nWould shield anyone from--\n\nWould shield Chandler himself from possession if he used it!\n\nHe did not hesitate. He slipped the helmet on his head, snapped the\nswitch and in a moment stood free of his own body, in the gray,\nluminous limbo, looking down at the pallid traceries that lay beneath.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe did not hesitate then either.\n\nHe did not pause to think or plan; it was as though he had planned\nevery step, in long detail, over many years. Chandler for at least a\nfew moments had the freedom to battle the execs on their own ground,\nthe freedom that any mourning parent or husband in the outside world\nwould know well how to use.\n\nChandler also knew. He was a weapon. He might die--but it was not a\ngreat thing to die, millions had done it for nothing under the rule\nof the execs, and he was privileged to be able to die trying to kill\n_them_.\n\nHe stepped callously around the hulk on the floor and found a door\nbehind the couch, a door and a hall, and at the end of that hall a\nlarge room that had once perhaps been a message center. Now it held\nrack after rack of electronic gear. He recognized it without elation.\nIt had had to be there.\n\nIt was the main transmitter for all the coronets of the exec.\n\nHe had only to pull one switch--that one there--and power would cease\nto flow. The coronets would be dead. The execs would be only humans.\nIn five minutes he could destroy enough parts so that it would be at\nleast a week's work to build it again, and in a week the slaves in\nHonolulu--somehow he could reach them, somehow he would tell them of\ntheir chance--could root out and destroy every exec on all the islands.\n\nOf course, there was the standby transmitter he himself had helped to\nbuild.\n\nHe realized tardily that Koitska would have made some arrangement for\nstarting that up by remote control.\n\nHe put down the tool-kit with which he had been advancing on the racks\nof transistors, and paused to think.\n\nHe was a fool, he saw after a moment. He could not destroy this\ninstallation--not yet--not until he had used it. He remembered to sit\ndown so that his body would not crash to the floor, and then he sent\nhimself out and up, to scan the nearby area.\n\nThere was no one there, nobody within a mile or more, except the feeble\nglimmer that was dying Koitska. He did not enter that body. He returned\nto his own long enough to barricade the door--it had a strong-looking\nlock, but he shouldered furniture against it too--and then he went\nup and out, grateful to Rosalie, who had taught him how to navigate\nin the curious world of the mind, flashing across water, under a\nmind-controlled plane, to the island of Hilo.\n\nThere _had_ to be someone near the standby installation.\n\nHe searched; but there was no one. No one in the building. No one near\nthe ruined field. No one in the village of the dead nearby. He was\ndesperate; he became frantic; he was on the point of giving up, and\nthen he found--someone? But it was a personality feebler than stricken\nKoitska's, a bare swampfire glow.\n\nNo matter. He entered it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt once he screamed silently and left it again. He had never known such\npain. A terrifying fire in the belly, a thunder past any migraine in\nthe head, a thousand lesser aches and woes in every member. He could\nnot imagine what person lived in such distress; but grimly he forced\nhimself to enter again.\n\nMoaning--it was astonishing how thick and animal-like the man's voice\nwas--Chandler forced his borrowed body stumbling through the jungle.\nTime was growing very short. He drove it gasping at an awkward run\nacross the airfield, dodged around one wrecked plane and blundered\nthrough the door. The pain was intolerable. He was hardly able to\nmaintain control.\n\nChandler stretched out the borrowed hand to pick up a heavy wrench even\nwhile he thought. But the hand would not grasp. He brought it to the\nweak, watering eyes. The hand had no fingers. It ended in a ball of\nscar tissue. The left hand was nearly as misshapen.\n\nPanicked, Chandler retreated from the body in a flash, back to his\nown; and then he began to think.\n\nIt was, it had to be, the creature he had seen in the village of the\ndead. A leper. One of the few who escaped from the colony at Molokai.\nChandler drove himself back to that body and, though it could not work\nwell, he could make it turn a frequency dial, using its clubbed hands\nlike sticks. He could make it throw a switch. He then caused it to\nplace the toothed edge of a rusting saw on the ground and strike at it\nwith its throat in a sort of reverse guillotine. Chandler could not see\nthat he had a choice; he dared not have that creature left where it\nmight be seized the moment he quit its body. It was better dead.\n\nAfter that it all became easy.\n\nIn his own body he destroyed the installation in Oahu. A few minutes\nat Koitska's work bench, and he had changed the frequency on his own\ncoronet to transmit on the new band the leper's touch had given the\nHilo equipment.\n\nHe worked rapidly and without errors, one ear cocked for the sound of\nsomeone coming to threaten what he was doing (the sound never came),\nimpatient to get the job done.\n\nHe was very impatient, for when he was done he would be the only exec.\n\nAnd the execs would be only slaves.\n\n\nXV\n\n\nChandler strolled out of the TWA building, very tired.\n\nIt was dawn. His job was done. He carried the coronet, the only working\ncoronet in the world, in his hand. He had spent the night killing,\nkilling, killing, and blood had washed away his passions; he was spent.\nHe had killed every exec he could find, in widening circles from the\nbuilding where his body lay. He had slit his dozen throats and fired\nbullets into his hundred hearts and hundred brains; he had entered\nbodies only long enough to feel for a coronet, and if it was there the\nbody was doomed; and he stopped only when it occurred to him he wasn't\neven doing that much any more. He had probably killed some dozens of\nslaves, as well as all the execs in reach. And when he stopped the orgy\nof killing he had made one last search of the nearer portions of the\nisland and found no one alive, and he had then realized that one of the\nclosest execs had been Rosalie Pan.\n\nHe knew that in a while he would feel very badly for having killed that\ngirl (which could she have been? The one with the shotgun in the mouth?\nThe one whose intestines he had spilled with a silver letteropener in a\nwhim of hara-kiri?), but just now he was too worn.\n\nHe was Chandler the giant killer, who had destroyed the creatures\nwho had destroyed a world, but he was all tired out. He poked at the\nfiligree of the coronet absently, as a man might caress the pretty rug\nwhich once had been the skin of a tiger that almost killed him. It was\nall that was left of the exec power. Who held this single coronet still\nheld the world.\n\nOf course, said a sly and treasonable voice in a corner of his mind,\nthe job was not really done.\n\nNot quite. Not all.\n\nThe job would not be done until it was impossible for anyone to find\nenough of the installations to be able to reconstruct them.\n\nAnd then, said the voice, while Chandler stared at the dawn, listening,\nwhat about the _good_ things the exec had done? Would he not be foolish\nto throw away so casually this one, unique chance to right every\nimaginable wrong the world might do him?\n\nChandler went back into the building and brewed some strong black\ncoffee. While it was bubbling on the stove he slipped the coronet back\natop his head. Only for a while, he promised. A very little while. He\npledged himself solemnly that it would be just long enough to clean up\nall loose ends--not a moment longer, he pledged. And knew that he was\nlying.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Plague of Pythons, by Frederik Pohl\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PLAGUE OF PYTHONS ***\n\n***** This file should be named 51804.txt or 51804.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/1/8/0/51804/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
