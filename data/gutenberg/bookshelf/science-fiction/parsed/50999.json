But no answer came, which had become irritating a long time ago.\nThis was a new Med Service sector for Calhoun. He'd been assigned to\nanother man's tour of duty because the other man had been taken down\nwith romance. He'd gotten married, which ruled him out for Med Ship\nduty. So now Calhoun listened to his own voice endlessly repeating a\ncall that should have been answered immediately.\n\nMurgatroyd the _tormal_ watched with beady, interested eyes. The planet\nMaya lay off to port of the Med Ship _Esclipus Twenty_. Its almost\ncircular disk showed full size on a vision screen beside the ship's\ncontrol board. The image was absolutely clear and vividly colored.\nThere was an ice cap in view. There were continents. There were seas.\nThe cloud system of a considerable cyclonic disturbance could be noted\noff at one side, and the continents looked reasonably as they should,\nand the seas were of that muddy, indescribable tint which indicates\ndeep water.\n\nCalhoun's own voice, taped an hour earlier, sounded in a speaker as it\nwent again to the communicator and then to the extremely visible world\na hundred thousand miles away.\n\n\"_Calling ground_,\" said Calhoun's recorded voice. \"_Med Ship_ Esclipus\nTwenty _calling ground to report arrival and ask coordinates for\nlanding. Our mass is fifty standard tons. Repeat, five-oh tons. Purpose\nof landing, planetary health inspection._\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe recorded voice stopped. There was silence except for the taped\nrandom noises which kept the inside of the ship from feeling like the\ninside of a tomb.\n\nMurgatroyd said: \"_Chee?_\"\n\nCalhoun said ironically, \"Undoubtedly, Murgatroyd. Undoubtedly!\nWhoever's on duty at the spaceport stepped out for a moment, or dropped\ndead, or did something equally inconvenient. We have to wait until he\ngets back or somebody else takes over.\"\n\nMurgatroyd said \"_Chee!_\" again and began to lick his whiskers. He\nknew that when Calhoun called on the communicator, another human voice\nshould reply. Then there should be conversation, and shortly the\nforce-fields of a landing-grid should take hold of the Med Ship and\ndraw it planet-ward. In time it ought to touch ground in a spaceport\nwith a gigantic, silvery landing-grid rising skyward all about it.\nThen there should be people greeting Calhoun cordially and welcoming\nMurgatroyd with smiles and petting.\n\n\"_Calling ground_,\" said the recorded voice yet again. \"_Med Ship_\nEsclipus Twenty--\"\n\nIt went on through the formal notice of arrival. Murgatroyd waited\nin pleasurable anticipation. When the Med Ship arrived at a port of\ncall humans gave him sweets and cakes, and they thought it charming\nthat he drank coffee just like a human, only with more gusto. Aground,\nMurgatroyd moved zestfully in society while Calhoun worked. Calhoun's\nwork was conferences with planetary health officials, politely\nreceiving such information as they thought important, and tactfully\ntelling them about the most recent developments in medical science as\nknown to the Interstellar Medical Service.\n\n\"Somebody,\" said Calhoun darkly, \"is going to catch the devil for this!\"\n\nThe communicator loudspeaker spoke abruptly.\n\n\"Calling Med Ship,\" said a voice. \"Calling Med Ship _Esclipus Twenty_!\nLiner _Candida_ calling. Have you had an answer from ground?\"\n\nCalhoun blinked. Then he said curtly:\n\n\"Not yet. I've been calling all of half an hour, and never a word out\nof them!\"\n\n\"We've been in orbit twelve hours,\" said the voice from emptiness.\n\"Calling all the while. No answer. We don't like it.\"\n\nCalhoun flipped a switch that threw a vision screen into circuit\nwith the ship's electron telescope. A starfield appeared and shifted\nwildly. Then a bright dot centered itself. He raised the magnification.\nThe bright dot swelled and became a chubby commercial ship, with\nthe false ports that passengers like to believe they looked through\nwhen in space. Two relatively large cargo ports on each side showed\nthat it carried heavy freight in addition to passengers. It was one\nof those workhorse intra-cluster ships that distributed the freight\nand passengers the long-haul liners dumped off only at established\ntransshipping ports.\n\nMurgatroyd padded across the Med Ship's cabin and examined the image\nwith a fine air of wisdom. It did not mean anything to him, but\n_tormals_ imitate human actions as parrots and parrakeets imitate human\nspeech. He said, \"_Chee!_\" as if making an observation of profound\nsignificance, then went back to the cushion and again curled up.\n\n\"We don't see anything wrong aground,\" the liner's voice complained,\n\"but they don't answer calls! We don't get any scatter-signals either.\nWe went down to two diameters and couldn't pick up a thing. And we have\na passenger to land. He insists on it!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBy ordinary, communications between different places on a planet's\nsurface use frequencies the ion-layers of the atmosphere either reflect\nor refract down past the horizon. But there is usually some small\nleakage to space, and line-of-sight frequencies are generally abundant.\nIt is one of the annoyances of a ship coming in to port that space near\nmost planets is usually full of local signals.\n\n\"I'll check,\" said Calhoun curtly. \"Stand by.\"\n\nThe _Candida_ would have arrived off Maya as the Med Ship had done, and\ncalled down as Calhoun had been doing. It was very probably a ship on\nschedule and the grid operator at the spaceport should have expected\nit. Space commerce was important to any planet, comparing more or less\nwith the export-import business of an industrial nation in ancient\ntimes on Earth. Planets had elaborate traffic-aid systems for the\ncargo-carriers which moved between solar systems as they'd once moved\nbetween continents on Earth. Such traffic aids were very carefully\nmaintained. Certainly for a spaceport landing-grid not to respond to\ncalls for twelve hours running seemed ominous.\n\n\"We've been wondering,\" said the _Candida_ querulously, \"if there could\nbe something radically wrong below. Sickness, for example.\"\n\nThe word \"sickness\" was a substitute for a more alarming word. But a\nplague had nearly wiped out the population of Dorset, once upon a time,\nand the first ships to arrive after it had broken out most incautiously\nwent down to ground, and so carried the plague to their next two ports\nof call. Nowadays quarantine regulations were enforced very strictly\nindeed.\n\n\"I'll try to find out what's the matter,\" said Calhoun.\n\n\"We've got a passenger,\" repeated the _Candida_ aggrievedly, \"who\ninsists that we land him by space-boat if we don't make a ship landing.\nHe says he has important business aground.\"\n\nCalhoun did not answer. The rights of passengers were extravagantly\nprotected, these days. To fail to deliver a passenger to his\ndestination entitled him to punitive damages which no spaceline could\nafford. So the Med Ship would seem heaven-sent to the _Candida's_\nskipper. Calhoun could relieve him of responsibility.\n\nThe telescope screen winked and showed the surface of the planet a\nhundred thousand miles away. Calhoun glared at the image on the port\nscreen and guided the telescope to the spaceport city--Maya City. He\nsaw highways and blocks of buildings. He saw the spaceport and its\nlanding-grid. He could see no motion, of course.\n\nHe raised the magnification. He raised it again. Still no motion. He\nupped the magnification until the lattice-pattern of the telescope's\namplifying crystal began to show. But at the ship's distance from the\nplanet, a ground-car would represent only the fortieth of a second of\narc. There was atmosphere, too, with thermals; anything the size of a\nground-car simply couldn't be seen.\n\nBut the city showed quite clearly. Nothing massive had happened to it.\nNo large-scale physical disaster had occurred. It simply did not answer\ncalls from space.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCalhoun flipped off the screen.\n\n\"I think,\" he said irritably into the communicator microphone, \"I\nsuspect I'll have to make an emergency landing. It could be something\nas trivial as a power failure--\" but he knew that was wildly\nimprobable--\"or it could be--anything. I'll land on rockets and tell\nyou what I find.\"\n\nThe voice from the _Candida_ said hopefully:\n\n\"Can you authorize us to refuse to land our passenger for his own\nprotection? He's raising the devil! He insists that his business\ndemands that he be landed.\"\n\nA word from Calhoun as a Med Service man would protect the spaceliner\nfrom a claim for damages. But Calhoun didn't like the look of things.\nHe realized, distastefully, that he might find practically anything\ndown below. He might find that he had to quarantine the planet and\nhimself with it. In such a case he'd need the _Candida_ to carry word\nof the quarantine to other planets and thus to Med Service sector\nheadquarters.\n\n\"We've lost a lot of time,\" insisted the _Candida_. \"Can you authorize\nus--\"\n\n\"Not yet,\" said Calhoun. \"I'll tell you when I land.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"I'm signing off for the moment,\" said Calhoun. \"Stand by.\"\n\nHe headed the little ship downward, and as it gathered velocity he went\nover the briefing sheets covering this particular world. He'd never\ntouched ground here before. His occupation, of course, was seeing to\nthe dissemination of medical science as it developed under the Med\nService. The Service itself was neither political nor administrative.\nBut it was important. Every human-occupied world was supposed to have\na Med Ship visit at least once in four years to verify the state of\npublic health.\n\nMed Ship men like Calhoun offered advice on public-health problems.\nWhen something out of the ordinary turned up, the Med Service had a\nstaff of researchers who hadn't been wholly baffled yet. There were\ngreat ships which could carry the ultimate in laboratory equipment and\nspecialized personnel to any place where they were needed. Not less\nthan a dozen inhabited worlds in this sector alone owed the survival\nof their populations to the Med Service, and the number of those which\ncouldn't have been colonized without Med Service help was legion.\n\nCalhoun reread the briefing. Maya was one of four planets in this\ngeneral area whose life systems seemed to have had a common origin,\nsuggesting that the Arrhenius theory of space-traveling spores was true\nin some limited sense. A genus of ground-cover plants with motile stems\nand leaves and cannibalistic tendencies was considered strong evidence\nof common origin.\n\nThe planet had been colonized for two centuries now, and produced\norganic compounds of great value from indigenous plants, most of\nwhich were used in textile manufacture. There were no local endemic\ninfections to which men were susceptible. A number of human-use crops\nwere grown. Cereals, grasses and grains, however, could not be grown\nbecause of the native ground-cover motile-stem plants. All wheat and\ncereal food had to be imported, which fact severely limited Maya's\npopulation. There were about two million people on the planet, settled\non a peninsula in the Yucatan Sea and a small area of mainland.\nPublic-health surveys had shown a great many things about a great\nmany subjects ... but there was no mention of anything to account for\nthe failure of the spaceport to respond to arrival calls from space.\nNaturally!\n\nThe Med Ship drove on down, and the planet revolved beneath it.\n\nAs Maya's sunlit hemisphere enlarged, Calhoun kept the telescope's\nfield wide. He saw cities, and vast areas of cleared land where native\nplants were grown as raw materials for the organics' manufacturies. He\nsaw very little true chlorophyll green, though. Mayan foliage tended to\na dark olive color.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt fifty miles he was sure that the city streets were empty even\nof ground-car traffic. There was no spaceship aground in the\nlanding-grid. There were no ground-cars in motion on the splendid,\nmultiple-lane highways.\n\nAt thirty miles altitude there were still no signals in the atmosphere,\nthough when he tried amplitude-modulation reception he picked up\nstatic. But there was no normally modulated signal on the air at any\nfrequency. At twenty miles--no. At fifteen miles, broadcast power was\navailable, which proved that the landing-grid was working as usual,\ntapping the upper atmosphere for electric charges to furnish power for\nall the planet's needs.\n\nFrom ten miles down to ground-touch, Calhoun was busy.\n\nIt is not too difficult to land a ship on rockets, with reasonably\nlevel ground to land on. But landing at a specific spot is something\nelse. Calhoun juggled the ship to descend inside the grid itself. His\nrockets burned out pencil-thin holes through the clay and stone beneath\nthe tarmac. He cut them off.\n\nSilence. Stillness. The Med Ship's outside microphones picked up small\nnoises of wind blowing over the city. There was no other sound at all.\n\n--No. There was a singularly deliberate clicking sound, not loud and\nnot fast. Perhaps a click--a double click--every two seconds. That was\nall.\n\nCalhoun went into the airlock, with Murgatroyd frisking a little in\nthe expectation of great social success among the people of this world.\nWhen Calhoun cracked the outer airlock door he smelled something. It\nwas a faintly sour, astringent odor that had the quality of decay in\nit. But it was no kind of decay he recognized. Again stillness and\nsilence. No traffic-noise; not even the almost inaudible murmur that\nevery city has in all its ways at all hours. The buildings looked as\nbuildings should look at daybreak, except that the doors and windows\nwere open. It was somehow shocking.\n\nA ruined city is dramatic. An abandoned city is pathetic. This was\nneither. It was something new. It felt as if everybody had walked away,\nout of sight, within the past few minutes.\n\nCalhoun headed for the spaceport building with Murgatroyd ambling\npuzzledly at his side. Murgatroyd was disturbed. There should be people\nhere! They should welcome Calhoun and admire him--Murgatroyd--and he\nshould be a social lion with all the sweets he could eat and all the\ncoffee he could put into his expandable belly. But nothing happened!\nNothing at all.\n\n\"_Chee?_\" he asked anxiously.\n\n\"They've gone away,\" growled Calhoun. \"They probably left in\nground-cars. There's not one in sight.\"\n\nThere wasn't. Calhoun could look out through the grid foundations\nand see long, sunlit and absolutely empty streets. He arrived at the\nspaceport building. There was--there had been--a green area about the\nbase of the structure. There was not a living plant left. Leaves were\nwilted and limp. The remains had become almost a jelly of collapsed\nstems and blossoms of dark olive-green. The plants were dead; but not\nlong enough to have dried up. They might have wilted two or three days\nbefore.\n\nCalhoun went in the building. The spaceport log lay open on a desk. It\nrecorded the arrival of freight to be shipped away--undoubtedly--on the\n_Candida_ now uneasily in orbit somewhere aloft. There was no sign of\ndisorder. It was exactly as if the people here had walked out to look\nat something interesting, and hadn't come back.\n\nCalhoun trudged out of the spaceport and to the streets and buildings\nof the city proper. It was incredible! Doors were opened or unlocked.\nMerchandise in the shops lay on display, exactly as it had been spread\nout to interest customers. There was no sign of confusion anywhere.\nEven in a restaurant there were dishes and flatware on the tables. The\nfood in the plates was stale, as if three days old, but it hadn't yet\nbegun to spoil. The appearance of everything was as if people at their\nmeals had simply, at some signal, gotten up and walked out without any\npanic or disturbance.\n\nCalhoun made a wry face. He'd remembered something. Among the tales\nthat had been carried from Earth to the other worlds of the galaxy\nthere was a completely unimportant mystery story which people still\nsometimes tried to write an ending to. It was the story of an ancient\nsailing ship called the _Marie Celeste_, which was found drifting\naimlessly in the middle of the ocean. There was food on the cabin\ntable, and the galley stove was still warm. There was no sign of any\ntrouble, or terror, or disturbance which might cause the ship to be\nabandoned. But there was not a living soul on board. Nobody had ever\nbeen able to contrive a believable explanation.\n\n\"Only,\" said Calhoun to Murgatroyd, \"this is on a larger scale. The\npeople of this city walked out about three days ago, and didn't come\nback. Maybe all the people on the planet did the same, since there's\nnot a communicator in operation anywhere. To make the understatement\nof the century, Murgatroyd, I don't like this. I don't like it a bit!\"\n\n\nII\n\nOn the way back to the Med Ship, Calhoun stopped at another place\nwhere, on a grass-growing planet, there would have been green sward.\nThere were Earth-type trees, and some native ones, and between them\nthere should have been a lawn. The trees were thriving, but the\nground-cover plants were collapsed and rotting.\n\nCalhoun picked up a bit of the semi-slime and smelled it. It was\nfaintly sour, astringent, the same smell he'd noticed when he opened\nthe airlock door. He threw the stuff away and brushed off his hands.\nSomething had killed the ground-cover plants which had the habit of\nkilling Earth-type grass when planted here.\n\nHe listened. Everywhere that humans live, there are insects and birds\nand other tiny creatures which are essential parts of the ecological\nsystem to which the human race is adjusted. They have to be carried to\nand established upon every new world that mankind hopes to occupy. But\nthere was no sound of such living creatures here.\n\nIt was probable that the bellowing roar of the Med Ship's emergency\nrockets was the only real noise the city had heard since its people\nwent away.\n\nThe stillness bothered Murgatroyd. He said, \"_Chee!_\" in a subdued\ntone and stayed close to Calhoun. Calhoun shook his head. Then he said\nabruptly:\n\n\"Come along, Murgatroyd!\"\n\nHe went back to the building housing the grid controls. He didn't look\nat the spaceport log this time. He went to the instruments recording\nthe second function of a landing-grid. In addition to lifting up and\nletting down ships of space, a landing-grid drew down power from the\nions of the upper atmosphere and broadcast it. It provided all the\nenergy that humans on a world could need. It was solar power, in a way,\nabsorbed and stored by a layer of ions miles high, which then could be\ndrawn on and distributed by the grid. During his descent Calhoun had\nnoted that broadcast power was still available. Now he looked at what\nthe instruments said.\n\nThe needle on the dial showing power-drain moved slowly back and forth.\nIt was a rhythmic movement, going from maximum to minimum power-use,\nand then back again. Approximately six million kilowatts was being\ntaken out of the broadcast every two seconds for half of one second.\nThen the drain cut off for a second and a half, and went on again for\nhalf a second.\n\nFrowning, Calhoun raised his eyes to a very fine color photograph on\nthe wall above the power dials. It was a picture of the human-occupied\npart of Maya, taken four thousand miles out in space. It had been\nenlarged to four feet by six, and Maya City could be seen as an\nirregular group of squares and triangles measuring a little more than\nhalf an inch by three-quarters. The detail was perfect. It was possible\nto see perfectly straight, infinitely thin lines moving out from the\ncity. They were multiple-lane highways, mathematically straight from\none city to another, and then mathematically straight--though at a new\nangle--until the next. Calhoun stared thoughtfully at them.\n\n\"The people left the city in a hurry,\" he told Murgatroyd, \"and there\nwas little confusion, if any. So they knew in advance that they might\nhave to go. They were ready for it. If they took anything, they had it\nready packed in their cars. But they hadn't been sure they'd have to go\nbecause they were going about their businesses as usual. All the shops\nwere open and people were eating in restaurants, and so on.\"\n\nMurgatroyd said, \"_Chee!_\" as if in full agreement.\n\n\"Now,\" demanded Calhoun, \"where did they go? The question's really\nwhere could they go! There were about eight hundred thousand people in\nthis city. There'd be cars for everyone, of course, and two hundred\nthousand cars would take everybody. But that's a lot of ground-cars!\nPut 'em two hundred feet apart on a highway, and that's twenty-six\ncars to the mile on each lane. Run them at a hundred miles an hour on\na twelve-lane road--using all lanes one way--and that's twenty-six\nhundred cars per lane per hour, and that's thirty-one thousand ... two\nhighways make sixty-two ... three highways.... With two highways they\ncould empty the city in under three hours, and with three highways\nclose to two. Since there's no sign of panic, that's what they must\nhave done. Must have worked it out in advance, too. Maybe they'd done\nit before it happened ... whatever it was that happened.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe searched the photograph which was so much more detailed than a map.\nThere were mountains to the north of Maya City, but only one highway\nled north. There were more mountains to the west. One highway went into\nthem, but not through. To the south there was sea, which curved around\nsome three hundred miles from Maya City and put the human colony on\nMaya on a peninsula.\n\n\"They went east,\" said Calhoun presently. He traced lines with his\nfinger. \"Three highways go east; that's the only way they could go\nquickly. They hadn't been sure they'd have to go but they knew where to\ngo when they did. So when they got their warning, they left. On three\nhighways, to the east. And we'll follow them and ask what the hell they\nran away from. Nothing's visible here!\"\n\nHe went back to the Med Ship, Murgatroyd skipping with him.\n\nAs the airlock door closed behind them, he heard a click from the\noutside-microphone speakers. He listened. It was a doubled clicking,\nas of something turned on and almost at once turned off again. There\nwas a two-second cycle, the same as that of the power drain. Something\ndrawing six million kilowatts went on and immediately off again every\ntwo seconds. It made a sound in speakers linked to outside microphones,\nbut it didn't make a noise in the air. The microphone clicks were\ninduction; pick-up; like cross-talk on defective telephone cables.\n\nCalhoun shrugged his shoulders almost up to his ears. He went to the\ncommunicator.\n\n\"Calling _Candida_--\" he began, and the answer almost leaped down his\nthroat.\n\n\"_Candida_ to Med Ship. Come in! Come in! What's happened down there?\"\n\n\"The city's deserted without any sign of panic,\" said Calhoun, \"and\nthere's power and nothing seems to be broken down. But it's as if\nsomebody had said, 'Everybody clear out' and they did. That doesn't\nhappen on a whim! What's your next port of call?\"\n\nThe _Candida's_ voice told him, hopefully.\n\n\"Take a report,\" commanded Calhoun. \"Deliver it to the public health\noffice immediately you land. They'll get it to Med Service sector\nheadquarters. I'm going to stay here and find out what's been going on.\"\n\nHe dictated, growing irritated as he did so because he couldn't explain\nwhat he reported. Something serious had taken place, but there was no\nclue as to what it was. Strictly speaking, it wasn't certainly a public\nhealth affair. But any emergency the size of this one involved public\nhealth factors.\n\n\"I'm remaining aground to investigate,\" finished Calhoun. \"I will\nreport further when or if it is possible. Message ends.\"\n\n\"What about our passenger?\"\n\n\"To the devil with your passenger!\" said Calhoun peevishly. \"Do as you\nplease!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe cut off the communicator and prepared for activity outside the ship.\nPresently he and Murgatroyd went to look for transportation. The Med\nShip couldn't be used for a search operation; it didn't carry enough\nrocket fuel. They'd have to use a ground vehicle.\n\nIt was again shocking to note that nothing had moved but sun shadows.\nAgain it seemed that everybody had simply walked out of some door or\nother and failed to come back. Calhoun saw the windows of jewelers'\nshops. Treasures lay unguarded in plain view. He saw a florist's shop.\nHere there were Earth-type flowers apparently thriving, and some\nstrange beautiful flowers with olive-green foliage which throve as well\nas the Earth-plants. There was a cage in which a plant had grown, and\nthat plant was wilting and about to rot. But a plant that had to be\ngrown in a cage....\n\nHe found a ground-car agency, perhaps for imported cars, perhaps for\nthose built on Maya. He went in and from the cars on display he chose\none, an elaborate sports car. He turned its key and it hummed. He drove\nit carefully out into the empty street, Murgatroyd sitting interestedly\nbeside him.\n\n\"This is luxury, Murgatroyd,\" said Calhoun. \"Also it's grand theft. We\nmedical characters can't usually afford such things. Or have an excuse\nto steal them. But these are parlous times, so we take a chance.\"\n\n\"_Chee!_\" said Murgatroyd.\n\n\"We want to find a fugitive population and ask what they ran away from.\nAs of the moment, it seems that they ran away from nothing. They may be\npleased to know they can come back.\"\n\nMurgatroyd again said, \"_Chee!_\"\n\nCalhoun drove through vacant ways. It was somehow nerve-racking. He\nfelt as if someone should pop out and say \"Boo!\" at any instant. He\ndiscovered an elevated highway and a ramp leading up to it. At a\ncloverleaf he drove eastward, watching sharply for any sign of life.\nThere was none.\n\nHe was nearly out of the city when he felt the chest impact of a sonic\nboom, and then heard a trailing away growling sound which seemed to\ncome from farther away as it died out. It was the result of something\ntraveling faster than sound, so that the noise it made far away had to\ncatch up with the sound it emitted nearby.\n\nHe stared up. He saw a parachute blossom as a bare speck against the\nblue. Then he heard the even deeper-toned roaring of a supersonic craft\nclimbing skyward. It could be a spaceliner's lifeboat, descended into\natmosphere and going out again.\n\nIt was. It had left a parachute behind, and now went back to space to\nrendezvous with its parent ship.\n\n\"That,\" said Calhoun impatiently, \"will be the _Candida's_ passenger.\nHe was insistent enough.\"\n\nHe scowled. The _Candida's_ voice had said its passenger demanded to\nbe landed for business reasons. And Calhoun had a prejudice against\nsome kinds of business men who would think their own affairs more\nimportant than anything else. Two standard years before, he'd made a\nplanetary health inspection on Texia II, in another galactic sector. It\nwas a llano planet and a single giant business enterprise. Illimitable\nprairies had been sown with an Earth-type grass which destroyed\nthe native ground-cover--the reverse of the ground-cover situation\nhere--and the entire planet was a monstrous range for beef cattle.\nDotted about were gigantic slaughterhouses, and cattle in masses of\ntens of thousands were shifted here and there by ground-induction\nfields which acted as fences. Ultimately the cattle were driven by\nthese same induction fences to the slaughter houses and actually into\nthe chutes where their throats were slit. Every imaginable fraction of\na credit of profit was extracted from their carcasses, and Calhoun had\nfound it appalling.\n\nHe was not sentimental about cattle, but the complete cold-bloodedness\nof the entire operation sickened him. The same cold-bloodedness was\npractised toward the human employees who ran the place. Their living\nquarters were sub-marginal. The air stank of cattle murder. Men worked\nfor the Texia Company or they did not work. If they did not work\nthey did not eat. If they worked and ate,--Calhoun could see nothing\nsatisfying in being alive on a world like that! His report to Med\nService had been biting. He'd been prejudiced against businessmen ever\nsince.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut a parachute descended, blowing away from the city. It would land\nnot too far from the highway he followed. And it didn't occur to\nCalhoun not to help the unknown chutist. He saw a small figure dangling\nbelow the chute. He slowed the ground-car as he estimated where the\nparachute would land.\n\nHe was off the twelve-lane highway and on a feeder road when the chute\nwas a hundred feet high. He was racing across a field of olive-green\nplants that went all the way to the horizon when the parachute actually\ntouched ground. There was a considerable wind. The man in the harness\nbounced. He didn't know how to spill the air. The chute dragged him.\n\nCalhoun sped ahead, swerved and ran into the chute. He stopped the car\nand the chute stopped with it. He got out.\n\nThe man lay in a hopeless tangle of cordage. He thrust unskilfully at\nit. When Calhoun came up he said suspiciously:\n\n\"Have you a knife?\"\n\nCalhoun offered a knife, politely opening its blade. The man slashed\nat the cords and freed himself. There was an attache case lashed to\nhis chute harness. He cut at those cords. The attache case not only\ncame clear, but opened. It dumped out an incredible mass of brand new,\ntightly packed interstellar credit certificates. Calhoun could see that\nthe denominations were one thousand and ten thousand credits. The man\nfrom the chute reached under his armpit and drew out a blaster.\n\nIt was not a service weapon. It was elaborate, practically a toy. With\na dour glance at Calhoun he put it in a side pocket and gathered up\nthe scattered money. It was an enormous sum, but he packed it back. He\nstood up.\n\n\"My name is Allison,\" he said in an authoritative voice. \"Arthur\nAllison. I'm much obliged. Now I'll ask you to take me to Maya City.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Calhoun politely. \"I just left there. It's deserted. I'm not\ngoing back. There's nobody there.\"\n\n\"But I've important bus--\" The other man stared. \"It's deserted? But\nthat's impossible!\"\n\n\"Quite,\" agreed Calhoun, \"but it's true. It's abandoned. Uninhabited.\nEverybody's left it. There's no one there at all.\"\n\nThe man who called himself Allison blinked unbelievingly. He swore.\nThen he raged profanely.\n\nBut he was not bewildered by the news. Which, upon consideration, was\nitself almost bewildering. But then his eyes grew shrewd. He looked\nabout him.\n\n\"My name is Allison,\" he repeated, as if there were some sort of magic\nin the word. \"Arthur Allison. No matter what's happened, I've some\nbusiness to do here. Where have the people gone? I need to find them.\"\n\n\"I need to find them too,\" said Calhoun. \"I'll take you with me, if you\nlike.\"\n\n\"You've heard of me.\" It was a statement, confidently made.\n\n\"Never,\" said Calhoun politely. \"If you're not hurt, suppose you get in\nthe car? I'm as anxious as you are to find out what's happened. I'm Med\nService.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAllison moved toward the car.\n\n\"Med Service, eh? I don't think much of the Med Service! You people\ntry to meddle in things that are none of your business!\"\n\nCalhoun did not answer. The muddy man, clutching the attache case\ntightly, waded through the olive-green plants to the car and climbed\nin. Murgatroyd said cordially, \"_Chee-chee!_\" but Allison viewed him\nwith distaste.\n\n\"What's this?\"\n\n\"He's Murgatroyd,\" said Calhoun. \"He's a _tormal_. He's Med service\npersonnel.\"\n\n\"I don't like beasts,\" said Allison coldly.\n\n\"He's much more important to me than you are,\" said Calhoun, \"if the\nmatter should come to a test.\"\n\nAllison stared at him as if expecting him to cringe. Calhoun did not.\nAllison showed every sign of being an important man who expected his\nimportance to be recognized and catered to. When Calhoun stirred\nimpatiently he got into the car and growled a little. Calhoun took\nhis place. The ground-car hummed. It rose on the six columns of air\nwhich took the place of wheels and slid across the field of dark-green\nplants, leaving the parachute deflated across a number of rows, and a\ntrail of crushed-down plants where it had moved.\n\nIt reached the highway again. Calhoun ran the car up on the highway's\nshoulder, and then suddenly checked. He'd noticed something.\n\nHe stopped the car and got out. Where the ploughed field ended, and\nbefore the coated surface of the highway began, there was a space where\non another world one would expect to see green grass.\n\nOn this planet grass did not grow; but there would normally be some\nsort of self-planted vegetation where there was soil and sunshine and\nmoisture. There had been such vegetation here, but now there was only a\nthin, repellent mass of slimy and decaying foliage. Calhoun bent down\nto it.\n\nIt had a sour, faintly astringent smell of decay. These were the\nground-cover plants of Maya of which Calhoun had read. They had motile\nstems, leaves and flowers, and they had cannibalistic tendencies. They\nwere the local weeds which made it impossible to grow grain for human\nuse upon this world.\n\nAnd they were dead.\n\nCalhoun straightened up and returned to the car. Plants like this were\nwilted at the base of the spaceport building, and on another place\nwhere there should have been sward. Calhoun had seen a large dead\nmember of the genus in a florist's, that had been growing in a cage\nbefore it died. There was a singular coincidence here: humans ran away\nfrom something, and something caused the death of a particular genus\nof cannibal weeds.\n\nIt did not exactly add up to anything in particular, and certainly\nwasn't evidence for anything at all. But Calhoun drove on in a vaguely\npuzzled mood. The germ of a guess was forming in his mind. He couldn't\npretend to himself that it was likely, but it was surely no more\nunlikely than most of a million human beings abandoning their homes at\na moment's notice.\n\n\nIII\n\nThey came to the turnoff for a town called Tenochitlan, some forty\nmiles from Maya City. Calhoun swung off the highway to go through it.\n\nWhoever had chosen the name Maya for this planet had been interested\nin the legends of Yucatan, back on Earth. There were many instances of\nsuch hobbies in a Med Ship's list of ports of call. Calhoun touched\nground regularly on planets that had been named for countries and towns\nwhen men first roamed the stars, and nostalgically christened their\ndiscoveries with names suggested by homesickness. There was a Tralee,\nand a Dorset, and an Eire. Colonists not infrequently took their\nworld's given name as a pattern and chose related names for seas and\npeninsulas and mountain chains. On Texia the landing-grid rose near a\ntown called Corral and the principal meat-packing settlement was named\nRoundup.\n\nWhatever the name Tenochitlan would have suggested, though, was denied\nby the town itself. It was small, with a pleasing local type of\narchitecture. There were shops and some factories, and many strictly\nprivate homes, some clustered close together and others in the middles\nof considerable gardens. In those gardens also there was wilt and decay\namong the cannibal plants. There was no grass, because the plants\nprevented it, but now the motile plants themselves were dead. Except\nfor the one class of killed growing things, however, vegetation was\nluxuriant.\n\nBut the little city was deserted. Its streets were empty, its houses\nuntenanted. Some houses were apparently locked up here, though, and\nCalhoun saw three or four shops whose stock in trade had been covered\nover before the owners departed. He guessed that either this town had\nbeen warned earlier than the spaceport city, or else they knew they had\ntime to get in motion before the highways were filled with the cars\nfrom the west.\n\nAllison looked at the houses with keen, evaluating eyes. He did not\nseem to notice the absence of people. When Calhoun swung back on the\ngreat road beyond the little city, Allison regarded the endless fields\nof dark-green plants with much the same sort of interest.\n\n\"Interesting,\" he said abruptly when Tenochitlan fell behind and\ndwindled to a speck. \"Very interesting! I'm interested in land. Real\nproperty, that's my business. I've a land-owning corporation on Thanet\nThree. I've some holdings on Dorset, too, and elsewhere. It just\noccurred to me: what's all this land and the cities worth, with the\npeople all run away?\"\n\n\"What,\" asked Calhoun, \"are the people worth who've run?\"\n\nAllison paid no attention. He looked shrewd. Thoughtful.\n\n\"I came here to buy land,\" he said. \"I'd arranged to buy some hundreds\nof square miles. I'd buy more if the price were right. But--as things\nare, it looks like the price of land ought to go down quite a bit.\nQuite a bit!\"\n\n\"It depends,\" said Calhoun, \"on whether there's anybody left alive to\nsell it to you, and what sort of thing has happened.\"\n\nAllison looked at him sharply.\n\n\"Ridiculous!\" he said authoritatively. \"There's no question of their\nbeing alive!\"\n\n\"They thought there might be,\" observed Calhoun. \"That's why they ran\naway. They hoped they'd be safe where they ran to. I hope they are.\"\n\nAllison ignored the comment. His eyes remained intent and shrewd. He\nwas not bewildered by the flight of the people of Maya. His mind was\nbusy with contemplation of that flight from the standpoint of a man of\nbusiness.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe car went racing onward. The endless fields of dark green rushed\npast to the rear. The highway was deserted, just three strips of\nsurfaced road, mathematically straight, going on to the horizon. They\nwent on by tens and scores of miles, each strip wide enough to allow\nfour ground-cars to run side by side. The highway was intended to\nallow all the produce of all these fields to be taken to market or a\nprocessing plant at the highest possible speed and in any imaginable\nquantity. The same roads had allowed the cities to be deserted\ninstantly the warning--whatever the warning was--arrived.\n\nFifty miles beyond Tenochitlan there was a mile-long strip of sheds\ncontaining agricultural machinery for crop culture and trucks to carry\nthe crops to market. There was no sign of life about the machinery, nor\nin a further hour's run to westward.\n\nThen there was a city visible to the left. But it was not served\nby this particular highway, but another. There was no sign of any\nmovement in its streets. It moved along the horizon to the left and\nrear. Presently it disappeared.\n\nHalf an hour later still, Murgatroyd said:\n\n\"_Chee!_\"\n\nHe stirred uneasily. A moment later he said \"_Chee!_\" again.\n\nCalhoun turned his eyes from the road. Murgatroyd looked unhappy.\nCalhoun ran his hand over the _tormal's_ furry body. Murgatroyd pressed\nagainst him. The car raced on. Murgatroyd whimpered a little. Calhoun's\nhand felt the little animal's muscles tense sharply, and then relax,\nand after a little tense again. Murgatroyd said almost hysterically:\n\n\"_Chee-chee-chee-chee!_\"\n\nCalhoun stopped the car, but Murgatroyd did not seem to be relieved.\nAllison said impatiently, \"What's the matter?\"\n\n\"That's what I'm trying to find out,\" said Calhoun.\n\nHe felt Murgatroyd's pulse. The role of Murgatroyd in the Med Ship\n_Esclipus Twenty_ was not only that of charming companion in the long,\nisolated runs in overdrive. Murgatroyd was a part of the Med Service.\nHis tribe had been discovered on a planet in the Deneb sector, and\nmen had made pets of them, to the high satisfaction of the _tormals_.\nPresently it was discovered that veterinarians never had _tormals_\nfor patients. They were invariably in robustuous good health. They\ncontracted no infections from other animals; they shared no infections\nwith anybody else. The Med Service discovered that _tormals_ possessed\na dynamic immunity to germ and bacteria-caused diseases. Even\nviruses injected into their bloodstreams only provoked an immediate,\noverwhelming development of antibodies, so that _tormals_ couldn't be\ngiven any known disease. Which was of infinite value to the Med Service.\n\nNow every Med Ship that could be supplied with a _tormal_ carried a\nsmall, affectionate, whiskered member of the tribe. Men liked them,\nand they adored men. And when, as sometimes happened, by mutation or\nthe simple enmity of nature, a new kind of infection appeared in human\nsociety--why--_tormals_ defeated it. They produced specific antibodies\nto destroy it. Men analyzed the antibodies and synthesized them, and\nthey were available to all the humans who needed them. So a great many\nmillions of humans stayed alive, because _tormals_ were pleasant little\nanimals with a precious genetic gift of good health.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCalhoun looked at his sweep-second watch, timing the muscular spasms\nthat Murgatroyd displayed. They coincided with irregularities in\nMurgatroyd's heartbeat, coming at approximately two-second intervals.\nThe tautening of the muscles lasted just about half a second.\n\n\"But I don't feel it!\" said Calhoun.\n\nMurgatroyd whimpered again and said, \"_Chee-chee!_\"\n\n\"What's going on?\" demanded Allison with the impatience of a very\nimportant man indeed. \"If the beast's sick, he's sick! I've got to\nfind--\"\n\nCalhoun opened his med kit and went carefully through it until he found\nwhat he needed. He put a pill into Murgatroyd's mouth.\n\n\"Swallow it!\" he commanded.\n\nMurgatroyd resisted, but the pill went down. Calhoun watched him\nsharply. Murgatroyd's digestive system was delicate, but it was\ndependable. Anything that might be poisonous, Murgatroyd's stomach\nrejected instantly and emphatically.\n\nThe pill stayed down.\n\n\"Look!\" said Allison indignantly. \"I've got business to do! In this\nattache case I have millions of interstellar credits, in cash, to pay\ndown on purchases of land and factories. I ought to make some damned\ngood deals! And I figure that that's as important as anything else you\ncan think of! It's a damned sight more important than a beast with a\nbelly-ache!\"\n\nCalhoun looked at him coldly.\n\n\"Do you own land on Texia?\" he asked.\n\nAllison's mouth dropped open. Extreme suspicion and unease appeared\non his face. As a sign of the unease, his hand went to the side coat\npocket in which he'd put a blaster. He didn't pluck it out. Calhoun's\nleft fist swung around and landed. He took Allison's elaborate pocket\nblaster and threw it away among the monotonous rows of olive-green\nplants. He returned to absorbed observation of Murgatroyd.\n\nIn five minutes the muscular spasms diminished. In ten, Murgatroyd\nfrisked. But he seemed to think that Calhoun had done something\nremarkable. In the warmest of tones he said:\n\n\"_Chee!_\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said Calhoun. \"We'll go ahead. I suspect you'll do as well\nas we do--for a while.\"\n\nThe car lifted the few inches the air columns sustained it above the\nground. It went on, still to the eastward. But Calhoun drove more\nslowly now.\n\n\"Something was giving Murgatroyd rhythmic muscular spasms,\" he said\ncoldly. \"I gave him medication to stop them. He's more sensitive than\nwe are, so he reacted to a stimulus we haven't noticed yet. But I\nthink we'll notice it presently.\"\n\nAllison seemed to be dazed at the affront given him. It appeared to be\nunthinkable that anybody might lay hands on him.\n\n\"What the devil has that to do with me?\" he demanded angrily. \"And what\ndid you hit me for? You're going to pay for this!\"\n\n\"Until I do,\" Calhoun told him, \"you'll be quiet. And it does have the\ndevil to do with you. There was a Med Service gadget once--a tricky\nlittle device to produce contraction of chosen muscles. It was useful\nfor re-starting stopped hearts without the need of an operation.\nIt regulated the beat of hearts that were too slow or dangerously\nirregular. But some businessman had a bright idea and got a tame\nresearcher to link that gadget to ground induction currents. I suspect\nyou know that businessman!\"\n\n\"I don't know what you're talking about,\" snapped Allison. But he was\nsingularly tense.\n\n\"I do,\" said Calhoun unpleasantly. \"I made a public health inspection\non Texia a couple of years ago. The whole planet is a single, gigantic,\ncattle-raising enterprise. They don't use metal fences--the herds are\ntoo big to be stopped by such things. They don't use cowboys--they cost\nmoney. On Texia they use ground-induction and the Med Service gadget\nlinked together to serve as cattle fences. They act like fences, though\nthey're projected through the ground. Cattle become uncomfortable when\nthey try to cross them. So they draw back. So men control them. They\nmove them from place to place by changing the cattle fences, which\nare currents induced in the ground. The cattle have to keep moving\nor be punished by the moving fence. They're even driven into the\nslaughterhouse chutes by ground-induction fields! That's the trick\non Texia, where induction fields herd cattle. I think it's the trick\non Maya, where people are herded like cattle and driven out of their\ncities so the value of their fields and factories will drop,--so a land\nbuyer can find bargains!\"\n\n\"You're insane!\" snapped Allison. \"I just landed on this planet! You\nsaw me land! I don't know what happened before I got here! How could I?\"\n\n\"You might have arranged it,\" said Calhoun.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAllison assumed an air of offended and superior dignity. Calhoun drove\nthe car onward at very much less than the head-long pace he'd been\nkeeping to. Presently he looked down at his hands on the steering\nwheel. Now and then the tendons to his fingers seemed to twitch. At\nrhythmic intervals, the skin crawled on the back of his hands. He\nglanced at Allison. Allison's hands were tightly clenched.\n\n\"There's a ground-induction fence in action, all right,\" said Calhoun\ncalmly. \"You notice? It's a cattle fence and we're running into it. If\nwe were cattle, now, we'd turn around and move away.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you're talking about!\" said Allison.\n\nBut his hands stayed clenched. Calhoun slowed the car still more. He\nbegan to feel, all over his body, that every muscle tended to twitch at\nthe same time. It was a horrible sensation. His heart muscles tended\nto contract too, simultaneously with the rest, but one's heart has its\nown beat rate. Sometimes the normal beat coincided with the twitch.\nThen his heart pounded violently--so violently that it was painful. But\nequally often the imposed contraction of the heart muscles came just\nafter a normal contraction, and then it stayed tightly knotted for half\na second. It missed a beat, and the feeling was agony.\n\nNo animal would have pressed forward in the face of such sensations. It\nwould have turned back long ago. No animal. Not even Man.\n\nCalhoun stopped the car. He looked at Murgatroyd. Murgatroyd was\ncompletely himself. He looked inquiringly at Calhoun. Calhoun nodded to\nhim, but he spoke--with some difficulty--to Allison.\n\n\"We'll see--if this thing--builds up. You know that it's the\nTexia--trick. A ground-induction unit set up--here. It drove\npeople--like cattle. Now we've--run into it.--It's holding people--like\ncattle.\"\n\nHe panted. His chest muscles contracted with the rest, so that his\nbreathing was interfered with. But Murgatroyd, who'd been made uneasy\nand uncomfortable before Calhoun noticed anything wrong, was now\nbright and frisky. Medication had desensitized his muscles to outside\nstimuli. He would be able to take a considerable electric shock without\nresponding to it.\n\nBut he could be killed by one that was strong enough.\n\nA savage anger filled Calhoun. Everything fitted together. Allison\nhad put his hand convenient to his blaster when Calhoun mentioned\nTexia. It meant that Calhoun suspected what Allison knew to be true.\nA cattle-fence unit had been set up on Maya, and it was holding--like\ncattle--the people it had previously driven--like cattle. Calhoun\ncould deduce with some precision exactly what had been done. The first\nexperience of Maya with the cattle fence would have been very mild.\nIt would have been low-power, causing just enough uneasiness to be\nnoticed. It would have moved from west to east, slowly, and it would\nhave reached a certain spot and there faded out. And it would have been\na mystery and an uncomfortable thing, and nobody would understand it\non Maya. In a week it would almost be forgotten. But then there'd come\na stronger disturbance. And it would travel like the first one; down\nthe length of the peninsula on which the colony lay, but stopping at\nthe same spot as before, and then fading away to nothingness. And this\nalso would have seemed mysterious. But nobody would suspect humans of\ncausing it. There would be theorizing and much questioning, but it\nwould be considered an unfamiliar natural event.\n\nProbably the third use of the cattle fence would be most disturbing.\nThis time it would be acutely painful. But it would move into the\ncities and through them and past them, and it would go down the\npeninsula to where it had stopped and faded on two previous occasions.\n\nThe people of Maya would be disturbed and scared. But they considered\nthat they knew it began to the westward of Maya City, and moved toward\nthe east at such-and-such a speed, and it went so far and no farther.\nAnd they would organize themselves to apply this carefully worked out\ninformation.\n\nIt would not occur to any of them that they had learned how to be\ndriven like cattle.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCalhoun, of course, could only reason that this must have happened. But\nnothing else could have taken place. Perhaps there were more than three\nuses of the moving cattle fence to get the people prepared to move past\nthe known place at which it always faded to nothingness. They might\nhave been days apart, or weeks apart, or months. There might have been\nstronger manifestations followed by weaker ones and then stronger ones\nagain.\n\nBut there was an inductive cattle fence across the highway here.\nCalhoun had driven into it. Every two seconds the muscles of his\nbody tensed. Sometimes his heart missed a beat at the time that his\nbreathing stopped, and sometimes it pounded violently. It seemed that\nthe symptoms became more and more unbearable.\n\nHe got out his med kit, with hands that spasmodically jerked\nuncontrollably. He fumbled out the same medication he'd given\nMurgatroyd. He took two of the pellets.\n\n\"In reason,\" he said coldly, \"I ought to let you take what this damned\nthing would give you. But--here!\"\n\nAllison had panicked. The _idea_ of a cattle fence suggested\ndiscomfort, of course, but it did not imply danger. The _experience_\nof a cattle fence, designed for huge hoofed beasts instead of men,\nwas terrifying. Allison gasped. He made convulsive movements. Calhoun\nhimself moved erratically. For one and a half seconds out of two, he\ncould control his muscles. For half a second at a time, he could not.\nBut he poked a pill into Allison's mouth.\n\n\"Swallow it!\" he commanded. \"Swallow!\"\n\nThe ground-car rested tranquilly on the highway, which here went on for\na mile and then dipped in a gentle incline and then rose once more.\nThe totally level fields to right and left came to an end here. Native\ntrees grew, trailing preposterously with long fronds. Brushwood hid\nmuch of the ground. That looked normal. But the lower, ground-covering\nvegetation was wilted and rotting.\n\nAllison choked upon the pellet. Calhoun forced a second upon him.\nMurgatroyd looked inquisitively at first one and then the other of the\ntwo men. He said:\n\n\"_Chee? Chee?_\"\n\nCalhoun lay back in his seat, breathing carefully to keep alive. But\nhe couldn't do anything about his heartbeat. The sun shone brightly,\nthough now it was low, toward the horizon. There were clouds in the\nreddened sky. A gentle breeze blew. Everything, to outward appearance,\nwas peaceful and tranquil and commonplace upon this small world.\n\nBut in the area that human beings had taken over there\nwere cities which were still and silent and deserted, and\nsomewhere--somewhere!--the population of the planet waited uneasily for\nthe latest of a series of increasingly terrifying phenomena to come to\nan end. Up to this time the strange, creeping, universal affliction had\nbegun at one place, and moved slowly to another, and then diminished\nand ceased to be. But this was the greatest and worst of the torments.\nAnd it hadn't ended. It hadn't diminished. After three days it\ncontinued at full strength at the place where previously it had stopped\nand died away.\n\nThe people of Maya were frightened. They couldn't return to their\nhomes. They couldn't go anywhere. They hadn't prepared for an emergency\nto last for days. They hadn't brought supplies of food.\n\nIt began to look as if they were going to starve.\n\n\nIV\n\nCalhoun was in very bad shape when the sports car came to the end of\nthe highway.\n\nFirst, all the multiple roadways of the route that had brought him here\nwere joined by triple ribbons of road-surface from the north. For a\nspace there were twenty-four lanes available to traffic. They flowed\ntogether, and then there were twelve. Here there was evidence of an\nenormous traffic concentration at some time now past. Brush and small\ntrees were crushed and broken where cars had been forced to travel\noff the hard-surface roadways and through undergrowth. The twelve\nlanes dwindled to six, and the unpaved area on either side showed that\ninnumerable cars had been forced to travel off the highway altogether.\nThen there were three lanes, and then two, and finally only a single\nribbon of pavement where no more than two cars could run side by side.\nThe devastation on either hand was astounding. All visible vegetation\nfor half a mile to right and left was crushed and tangled. And then the\nnarrow surfaced road ceased to be completely straight. It curved around\na hillock--and here the ground was no longer perfectly flat--and came\nto an end.\n\nAnd Calhoun saw all the ground-cars of the planet gathered and parked\ntogether.\n\nThere were no buildings. There were no streets. There was nothing of\ncivilization but tens and scores of thousands of ground-cars. They were\nextraordinary to look at, stopped at random, their fronts pointed in\nall directions, their air-column tubes thrusting into the ground so\nthat there might be trouble getting them clear again.\n\nParked bumper to bumper in closely placed lines, in theory twenty-five\nthousand cars could be parked on a square mile of ground. But there\nwere very many times that number of cars here, and some places were\nunsuitable for parking, and there were lanes placed at random and\nthere'd been no special effort to put the maximum number of cars in\nthe smallest place. So the surface transportation system of the planet\nMaya spread out over some fifty sprawling square miles. Here, cars were\ncrowded closely. There, there was much room between them. But it seemed\nthat as far as one could see in the twilight there were glistening\nvehicles gathered confusedly, so there was nothing else to be seen but\nan occasional large tree rising from among them.\n\nCalhoun came to the end of the surfaced road. He'd waited for the\npellets he'd taken and given to Allison to have the effect they'd had\non Murgatroyd. That had come about. He'd driven on. But the strength of\nthe inductor field had increased to the intolerable. When he stopped\nthe sports car he showed the effects of what he'd been through.\n\nFigures on foot converged upon him instantly. There were eager calls.\n\n\"It's stopped? You got through? We can go back?\"\n\nCalhoun shook his head. It was just past sunset and many brilliant\ncolorings showed in the western sky, but they couldn't put color into\nCalhoun's face. His cheeks were grayish and his eyes were deep-sunk,\nand he looked like someone in the last stages of exhaustion. He said\nheavily:\n\n\"It's still there. We came through. I'm Med Service. Have you got a\ngovernment here? I need to talk to somebody who can give orders.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIf he'd asked two days earlier there would have been no answer, because\nthe fugitives were only waiting for a disaster to come to an end. One\nday earlier, he might have found men with authority busily trying to\narrange for drinking water for something like two millions of people,\nin the entire absence of wells or pumps or ways of making either.\nAnd if he'd been a day later, it is rather likely that he'd have\nfound savage disorder. But he arrived at sundown three days after the\nflight from the cities. There was no food to speak of, and water was\ndrastically short, and the fugitives were only beginning to suspect\nthat they would never be able to leave this place--and that they might\ndie here.\n\nMen left the growing crowd about the sports car to find individuals\nwho could give orders. Calhoun stayed in the car, resting from the\nunbearable strain he'd undergone. The ground-inductor cattle fence\nhad been ten miles deep. One mile was not bad. Only Murgatroyd had\nnoticed it. After two miles Calhoun and Allison suffered; but the\nmedication strengthened them to take it. But there'd been a long, long\nway in the center of the induction-field in which existence was pure\ntorment. Calhoun's muscles defied him for part of every two-second\ncycle, and his heart and lungs seemed constantly about to give up even\nthe pretense of working. In that part of the cattle-fence field, he'd\nhardly dared drive faster than a crawl, in order to keep control of\nthe car when his own body was uncontrollable. But presently the field\nstrength lessened and ultimately ended.\n\nNow Murgatroyd looked cordially at the figures who clustered about\nthe car. He'd hardly suffered at all. He'd had half as much of the\nmedication as Calhoun himself, and his body weight was only a tenth\nof Calhoun's. He'd made out all right. Now he looked expectantly at\nwhat became a jammed mass of crowding men about the vehicle that had\ncome through the invisible barrier across the highway. They hoped\ndesperately for news to produce hope. But Murgatroyd waited zestfully\nfor somebody to welcome him and offer him cakes and sweets, and\nundoubtedly presently a cup of coffee.\n\nBut nobody did.\n\nIt was a long time before there was a stirring at the edge of the\ncrowd. Night had fully fallen then, and for miles and miles in all\ndirections lights in the ground cars of Maya's inhabitants glowed\nbrightly. They drew upon broadcast power, naturally, for their motors\nand their lights. Off to one side someone shouted. Calhoun turned on\nhis headlights for a guide. More shoutings. A knot of men struggled to\nget through the crowd. With difficulty, presently, they reached the car.\n\n\"They say you got through,\" panted a tall man, \"but you can't get back.\nThey say--\"\n\nCalhoun roused himself. Allison, beside him, stirred. The tall man\npanted again:\n\n\"I'm the planetary president. What can we do?\"\n\n\"First, listen,\" said Calhoun tiredly.\n\nHe'd had a little rest. Not much, but some. The actual work he'd done\nin driving three hundred-odd miles from Maya City was trivial. But\nthe continuous, and lately violent, spasms of his heart and breathing\nmuscles had been exhausting. He heard Murgatroyd say ingratiatingly,\n\"_Chee-chee-chee-chee_,\" and put his hand on the little animal to quiet\nhim.\n\n\"The thing you ran away from,\" said Calhoun with effort, \"is a type of\nground-induction field using broadcast power from the grid. It's used\non Texia to confine cattle to their pastures and to move them where\nthey're wanted to be. But it was designed for cattle. It's a cattle\nfence. It could kill humans.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe went on, his voice gaining strength and steadiness as he spoke. He\nexplained, precisely, how a ground-induction field was projected in a\nline at a right angle to its source. It could be moved by adjustments\nof the apparatus by which it was projected.\n\n\"But--but if it uses broadcast power,\" the planetary president said\nurgently, \"then if the power broadcast is cut off it has to stop!\nIf you got through it coming here, tell us how to get through going\nback and we'll cut off the power broadcast ourselves! We've got to\ndo something immediately. The whole planet's here. There's no food!\nThere's no water! Something has to be done before we begin to die!\"\n\n\"But,\" said Calhoun, \"if you cut off the power you'll die anyway!\nYou've got a couple of million people here, and you're a hundred miles\nfrom food. Without power you couldn't get to food or bring it here. Cut\nthe power and you're still stranded here. Without power you'll die as\nsoon as with it.\"\n\nThere was a sound from the listening men around. It was partly a growl\nand partly a groan.\n\n\"I've just found this out,\" said Calhoun. \"I didn't know until the last\nten miles exactly what the situation was, and I had to come here to be\nsure. Now I need some people to help me. It won't be pleasant. I may\nhave enough medication to get a dozen people back through. It'll be\nsafer if I take only six. Get a doctor to pick me six men. Good heart\naction. Sound lungs. Two should be electronics engineers. The others\nshould be good shots. If you get them ready, I'll give them the same\nstuff that got us through. It's desensitizing medication, but it will\ndo only so much. And try and find some weapons for them.\"\n\nVoices murmured all around. Men hastily explained to other men what\nCalhoun had said. The creeping disaster before which they'd all\nfled,--it was not a natural catastrophe, but an artificial one! Men\nhad made it! They'd been herded here and their wives and children were\nhungry because of something men had done!\n\nA low-pitched, buzzing, humming sound came from the crowd about the\nsports car. For the moment, nobody asked what could be the motive for\nmen to do what had been done. Pure fury filled the mob. Calhoun leaned\ncloser to Allison.\n\n\"I wouldn't get out of the car if I were you,\" he said in a low tone.\n\"I certainly wouldn't try to buy any real property at a low price!\"\n\nAllison shivered. There was a vast, vast stirring as the explanation\npassed from man to man. Figures moved away in the darkness. Lighted\ncar windows winked as they moved through the obscurity. The population\nof Maya was spread out over very many square miles of what had been\nwilderness, and there was no elaborate communication system by which\ninformation could be spread quickly. But long before dawn there'd be\nnobody who didn't know that they'd fled from a man-made danger and were\nheld here like cattle, behind a cattle fence, apparently abandoned to\ndie.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAllison's teeth chattered. He was a business man and up to now he'd\nthought as one. He'd made decisions in offices, with attorneys and\nsecretaries and clerks to make the decisions practical and safe,\nwithout any concern for any consequences other than financial ones.\n\nHe saw possible consequences to himself, here and now. He'd landed on\nMaya because he considered the matter too important to trust to anybody\nelse. Even riding with Calhoun on the way here, he'd only been elated\nand astonished at the success of the intended coup. He'd raised his\naim. For a while he'd believed that he'd end as the sole proprietor\nof the colony on Maya, with every plant growing for his profit, and\nevery factory earning money for him, and every inhabitant his employee.\nIt had been the most grandiose possible dream. The details and the\nmaneuvers needed to complete it flowed into his mind.\n\nBut now his teeth chattered. At ten words from Calhoun he would\nliterally be torn to pieces by the raging men about him. His attache\ncase with millions of credits in cash--it would be proof of whatever\nCalhoun chose to say. Allison knew terror down to the bottom of his\nsoul. But he dared not move from Calhoun's side, even though a single\nsentence in the calmest of voices would destroy him, and he'd never\nfaced actual, understood, physical danger before.\n\nPresently men came, one by one, to take orders from Calhoun. They were\nable-bodied and grim-faced men. Two were electronics engineers, as he'd\nspecified. One was a policeman. There were two mechanics and a doctor\nwho was also amateur tennis champion of the planet. Calhoun doled\nout to them the pellets that reduced the sensitiveness of muscles to\nexternally applied stimuli. He gave instructions. They'd go as far into\nthe cattle fence as they could reasonably endure. Then they'd swallow\nthe pellets and let them act. Then they'd go on. His stock of pellets\nwas limited. He could give three to each man.\n\nMurgatroyd squirmed disappointedly as this briefing went on. Obviously,\nhe wasn't to make a social success here. He was annoyed, and he needed\nmore space. Calhoun tossed Allison's attache case behind the seats.\nAllison was too terrified to protest. It still did not increase the\nspace left on the front seat between Calhoun and Allison.\n\nFour humming ground cars lifted eight inches off the ground and hovered\nthere on columns of rushing air. Calhoun took the lead. His headlights\nmoved down the single-lane road to which two joining twelve-lane\nhighways had shrunk. Behind him, other headlights moved into line.\nCalhoun's car moved away into the darkness. The others followed.\n\nBrilliant stars shone overhead. A cluster of thousands of suns, a\nhundred light-years away, made a center of illumination that gave\nMaya's night the quality of a vivid if diffused moonlight. The cars\nwent on. Presently Calhoun felt the twitchings of minor muscular\nspasms. He was riding into the field which had been first devised for\npurposes remote from the herding of cattle or humans, but applied to\nthe first use on the planet Texia, and now applied to the second here.\n\nThe road became two, and then four, and then eight lanes wide. Then\nfour lanes swirled off to one side, and the remaining four presently\ndoubled, and then widened again, and it was the twelve-lane turnpike\nthat had brought Calhoun here from Maya City.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut the rhythmic interference with his body grew stronger. Allison had\nspoken not one single word while Calhoun conferred with the people of\nMaya beyond the highway. His teeth chattered as they started back. He\ndidn't attempt to speak during the beginning of the ride through the\ncattle-fence field. His teeth chattered, and stopped, and chattered\nagain, and at long last he panted despairingly:\n\n\"Are you going to let the thing kill me?\"\n\nCalhoun stopped. The cars behind him stopped. He gave Allison two\npellets and took two himself. With Murgatroyd insistently accompanying\nhim, he went along the cars which trailed him. He made sure the six men\nhe'd asked for took their pellets and that they had an adequate effect.\nHe went back to the sports car.\n\nAllison whimpered a little when he and Murgatroyd got back in.\n\n\"I thought,\" said Calhoun conversationally, \"that you might try to take\noff by yourself, just now. It would solve a problem for me. Of course\nit wouldn't solve any for you. But I don't think your problems have any\nsolution, now.\"\n\nHe started the car up again. It moved forward. The other cars trailed\ndutifully. They went on through the starlit night. Calhoun noted that\nthe effect of the cattle fence was less than it had been before. The\nfirst desensitizing pellets had not wholly lost their effect when he\nadded to it. But he kept his speed low until he was certain the other\ndrivers had endured the anguish of passing through the cattle-fence\nfield.\n\nPresently he was confident that the cattle field was past. He sent his\ncar up to eighty miles an hour. The other cars followed faithfully. To\na hundred. They did not drop behind. The car hummed through the night\nat top speed--a hundred and twenty, a hundred and thirty miles an hour.\nThe three other cars' headlights faithfully kept pace with him.\n\nAllison, said desperately, \"Look! I--don't understand what's happened.\nYou talk as if I'd planned all this. I--did have advance notice of a--a\nresearch project here. But it shouldn't have held the people there for\ndays! Something went wrong! I only believed that people would want to\nleave Maya. I'd only planned to buy as much acreage as I could, and\ncontrol of as many factories as possible. That's all! It was business!\nOnly business!\"\n\nCalhoun did not answer. Allison might be telling the truth. Some\nbusinessmen would think it only intelligent to frighten people into\nselling their holdings below true value. Something of the sort happened\nevery day in stock exchanges. But the people of Maya could have died!\n\nFor that matter, they still might. They couldn't return to their homes\nand food so long as broadcast power kept the cattle-fence in existence.\nBut they could not return to their homes and food supplies if the power\nbroadcast was cut off, either.\n\nOver all the night surface of the world of Maya there was light only\non one highway at one spot, and a multitude of smaller, lesser lights\nwhere the people of Maya waited to find out whether they would live or\ndie.\n\n\nV\n\nCalhoun considered coldly. They were beyond what had been the\nfarthest small city on the multiple highway. They would go on past\nnow-starlit fields of plants native to Maya, passing many places where\ntrucks loaded with the plants climbed up to the roadway and headed\nfor the factories which made use of them. The fields ran for scores\nof miles along the highway's length. They reached out beyond the\nhorizon,--perhaps scores of miles in that direction, too. There were\nthousands upon thousands of square miles devoted to the growing of the\ndark-green vegetation which supplied the raw materials for Maya's space\nexports. Some hundred-odd miles ahead, the small town of Tenochitlan\nlay huddled in the light of the distant star-cluster. Beyond that, more\nhighway and Maya City. Beyond that--\n\nCalhoun reasoned that the projector to make the induction cattle fence\nwould be beyond Maya City, somewhere in the mountains the photograph\nin the spaceport building showed. A large highway went into those\nmountains for a limited distance only.\n\nA ground-inductor projector field always formed at a right angle to\nthe projector which was its source. It could be adjusted--the process\nwas analogous to focusing--to come into actual being at any distance\ndesired, and the distance could be changed. To drive the people of\nMaya City eastward, the projector of a cattle fence--about which\nthey would know nothing; it would be totally strange and completely\nmysterious--the projector of the cattle fence would need to be west of\nthe people to be driven. Logically, it would belong in the mountains.\nPractically, it would be concealed. Drawing on broadcast power to do\nits work, there would be no large power source needed to give it the\nsix million kilowatts it required. It should be quite easy to hide\nbeyond any quick or easy discovery. Hunting it out might require weeks\nof searching.\n\nBut the people beyond the end of the highway couldn't wait. They had\nno food, and holes scrabbled down to ground-water by men digging with\ntheir bare hands simply would not be adequate. The cattle fence had\nto be cut off immediately--while the broadcast of power had to be\ncontinued.\n\nCalhoun made an abrupt grunting noise. Phrasing the thing that needed\nto be done was practically a blueprint of how to do it. Simple! He'd\nneed the two electronics engineers, of course. But that would be the\ntrick....\n\nHe drove on at a hundred thirty miles an hour with his lips set wrily.\nThe three other cars came behind him. Murgatroyd watched the way ahead.\nMile after mile, half-minute after half-minute, the headlights cast\nbrilliantly blinding beams before the cars. Murgatroyd grew bored. He\nsaid, \"_Chee!_\" in a discontented fashion and tried to curl up between\nAllison and Calhoun. There wasn't room. He crawled over the seat-back.\nHe moved about, back there. There were rustling sounds. He settled\ndown. Presently there was silence. Undoubtedly he had draped his furry\ntail across his nose and gone soundly off to sleep.\n\nAllison spoke suddenly. He'd had time to think, but he had no practice\nin various ways of thinking.\n\n\"How much money have you got?\" he asked.\n\n\"Not much,\" said Calhoun. \"Why?\"\n\n\"I--haven't done anything illegal,\" said Allison, with an unconvincing\nair of confidence, \"but I could be put to some inconvenience if you\nwere to accuse me before others of what you've accused me personally.\nYou seem to think that I planned a criminal act. That the action I know\nof--the research project I'd heard of--that it became--that it got out\nof hand is likely. But I am entirely in the clear. I did nothing in\nwhich I did not have the advice of counsel. I am legally unassailable.\nMy lawyers--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"That's none of my business,\" Calhoun told him. \"I'm a medical man.\nI landed here in the middle of what seemed to be a serious public\nhealth situation. I went to see what had happened. I've found out. I\nstill haven't the answer,--not the whole answer anyway. But the human\npopulation of Maya is in a state of some privation, not to say danger.\nI hope to end it. But I've nothing to do with anybody's guilt or\ninnocence of crime or criminal intent or anything else.\"\n\nAllison swallowed. Then he said with smooth confidence:\n\n\"But you could cause me inconvenience. I would appreciate it if you\nwould--would--\"\n\n\"Cover up what you've done?\" asked Calhoun.\n\n\"No! I've done nothing wrong. But you could simply use discretion. I\nlanded by parachute to complete some business deals I'd arranged months\nago. I will go through with them. I will leave on the next ship.\nThat's perfectly open and above board. Strictly business. But you could\nmake a--an unpleasing public image of me. Yet I have done nothing any\nother business man wouldn't do! I did happen to know of a research\nproject--\"\n\n\"I think,\" said Calhoun without heat, \"that you sent men here with a\ncattle-fence device from Texia to frighten the people on Maya. They\nwouldn't know what was going on. They'd be scared; they'd want to get\naway. So you'd be able to buy up practically all the colony for the\nequivalent of peanuts. I can't prove that,\" he conceded, \"but that's my\nopinion. But you want me not to state it. Is that right?\"\n\n\"Exactly!\" said Allison. He'd been shaken to the core, but he managed\nthe tone and the air of a dignified man of business discussing an\nunpleasant subject with fine candor. \"I assure you you are mistaken.\nYou agree that you can't prove your suspicions. If you can't prove\nthem, you shouldn't state them. That is simple ethics. You agree to\nthat!\"\n\nCalhoun looked at him curiously.\n\n\"Are you waiting for me to tell you my price?\"\n\n\"I'm waiting,\" said Allison reprovingly, \"for you to agree not to cause\nme embarrassment. I won't be ungrateful. After all, I'm a person of\nsome influence. I could do a great deal to your benefit. I'd be glad--\"\n\n\"Are you working around to guess at a price I'll take?\" asked Calhoun\nwith the same air of curiosity.\n\nHe seemed much more curious than indignant, and much more amused\nthan curious. Allison sweated suddenly. Calhoun didn't appear to be\nbribable. But Allison knew desperation.\n\n\"If you want to put it that way--yes,\" he said harshly. \"You can name\nyour own figure. I mean it!\"\n\n\"I won't say a word about you,\" said Calhoun. \"I won't need to. The\ncharacters who're operating your cattle fence will do all the talking\nthat's necessary. Things all fit together,--except for one item.\nThey've been dropping into place all the while we've been driving down\nthis road.\"\n\n\"I said you can name your own figure!\" Allison's voice was shrill. \"I\nmean it! Any figure! Any!\"\n\nCalhoun shrugged.\n\n\"What would a Med Ship man do with money? Forget it!\"\n\nHe drove on. The highway turnoff to Tenochitlan appeared. Calhoun went\nsteadily past it. The other connection with the road through the town\nappeared. He left it behind.\n\nAllison's teeth chattered again.\n\nThe buildings of Maya City began to appear, some twenty minutes later.\nCalhoun slowed and the other cars closed up. He opened a window and\ncalled:\n\n\"We want to go to the landing-grid first. Somebody lead the way!\"\n\nA car went past and guided the rest assuredly to a ramp down from the\nnow-elevated road, and through utterly dark streets, of which some were\nnarrow and winding, and came out abruptly where the landing-grid rose\nskyward. At the bottom its massive girders looked huge and cyclopean in\nthe starlight, but the higher courses looked like silver lace against\nthe stars.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey went to the control building. Calhoun got out. Murgatroyd hopped\nout after him, dust clinging to his fur. He shook himself, and a\nten-thousand-credit interstellar credit certificate fell to the ground.\nMurgatroyd had made a soft place for sleeping out of the contents of\nAllison's attache case. It was assuredly the most expensive if not the\nmost comfortable sleeping cushion a _tormal_ ever had. Allison sat\nstill as if numbed. He did not even pick up the certificate.\n\n\"I need you two electronics men,\" said Calhoun. Then he said\napologetically to the others, \"I only figured out something on the way\nhere. I'd believed we might have to take some drastic action, come\ndaybreak. But now I doubt it. I do suggest, though, that you turn off\nthe car headlights and get set to do some shooting if anybody turns up.\nI don't know whether they will or not.\"\n\nHe led the way inside. He turned on lights. He went to the place where\ndials showed the amount of power actually being used of the enormous\namount available. Those dials now showed an extremely small power\ndrain, considering that the cities of a planet depended on the grid.\nBut the cities were dark and empty of people. The demand needle wavered\nback and forth, rhythmically. Every two seconds the demand for power\nwent up by six million kilowatts, approximately. The demand lasted for\nhalf a second, and stopped. For a second and a half the power in use\nwas reduced by six million kilowatts. During this period only automatic\npumps and ventilators and freezing equipment drew on the broadcast\npower for energy. Then the six-million-kilowatt demand came again for\nhalf a second.\n\n\"The cattle fence,\" said Calhoun, \"works for half a second out of every\ntwo seconds. It's intermittent or it would simply paralyze animals\nthat wandered into it. Or people. Being intermittent, it drives them\nout instead. There'll be tools and parts for equipment here, in case\nsomething needs repair. I want you to make something new.\"\n\nThe two electronics technicians asked questions.\n\n\"We need,\" said Calhoun, \"an interruptor that will cut off the power\nbroadcast for the half-second the ground-induction field is supposed\nto be on. Then it should turn on the broadcast power for the second\nand a half the cattle fence is supposed to be off. That will stop the\ncattle-fence effect, and I think a ground car should be able to work\nwith power that's available for three half-seconds out of four.\"\n\nThe electronics men blinked at him. Then they grinned and set to work.\nCalhoun went exploring. He found a lunch box in a desk with three very\nstale sandwiches in it. He offered them around.\n\nIt appeared that nobody wanted to eat while their families--at the end\nof the highway--were still hungry.\n\nThe electronics men called on the two mechanics to help build\nsomething. They explained absorbedly to Calhoun that they were making\na cutoff which would adjust to any sudden six-million-kilowatt demand,\nno matter what time interval was involved. A change in the tempo of the\ncattle-fence cycle wouldn't bring it back on.\n\n\"That's fine!\" said Calhoun. \"I wouldn't have thought of that!\"\n\nHe bit into a stale sandwich and went outside. Allison sat limply,\ndespairingly, in his seat in the car.\n\n\"The cattle fence is going off,\" said Calhoun without triumph. \"The\npeople of the city will probably begin to get here around sunrise.\"\n\n\"I--I did nothing legally wrong!\" said Allison, dry-throated. \"Nothing!\nThey'd have to prove that I knew what the--consequences of the research\nproject would be. That couldn't be proved! It couldn't! So I've done\nnothing legally wrong....\"\n\nCalhoun went inside, observing that the doctor who was also tennis\nchampion, and the policeman who'd come to help him, were keeping keen\neyes on the city and the foundations of the grid and all other places\nfrom which trouble might come.\n\nThere was a fine atmosphere of achievement in the power-control\nroom. The power itself did not pass through these instruments, but\nrelays here controlled buried massive conductors which supplied the\nworld with power. And one of the relays had been modified. When the\ncattle-fence projector closed its circuit, the power went off. When\nthe ground-inductor went off, the power went on. There was no longer\na barrier across the highways leading to the east. It was more than\nprobable that ground cars could run on current supplied for one and a\nhalf seconds out of every two. They might run jerkily, but they would\nrun.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHalf an hour later, the amount of power drawn from the broadcast began\nto rise smoothly and gradually. It could mean only that cars were\nbeginning to move.\n\nForty-five minutes later still, Calhoun heard stirrings outside. He\nwent out. The two men on guard gazed off into the city. Something moved\nthere. It was a ground-car, running slowly and without lights. Calhoun\nsaid undisturbedly:\n\n\"Whoever was running the cattle fence found out their gadget wasn't\nworking. Their lights flickered, too. They came to see what was the\nmatter at the landing-grid. But they've seen the lighted windows. Got\nyour blasters handy?\"\n\nBut the unlighted car turned and raced away. Calhoun only shrugged.\n\n\"They haven't a prayer,\" he said. \"We'll take over their apparatus\nas soon as it's light. It'll be too big to destroy, and there'll be\nfingerprints and such to identify them as the men who ran it. And\nthey're not natives. When the police start to look for the strangers\nwho were living where the cattle-fence projector was set up.... They\ncan go into the jungles where there's nothing to eat, or they can give\nthemselves up.\"\n\nHe moved toward the door of the control building once more. Allison\nsaid desperately:\n\n\"They'll have hidden their equipment. You'll never be able to find it!\"\n\nCalhoun shook his head in the starlight.\n\n\"Anything that can fly can spot it in minutes. Even on the ground\none can walk almost straight to it. You see, something happened they\ndidn't count on. That's why they've left it turned on at full power.\nThe earlier, teasing uses of the cattle fence were low-power. Annoying,\nto start with, and uncomfortable the second time, and maybe somewhat\npainful the third. But the last time it was full power.\"\n\nHe shrugged. He didn't feel like a long oration. But it was obvious.\nSomething had killed the plants of a certain genus of which small\nspecies were weeds that destroyed Earth-type grasses. The ground-cover\nplants--and the larger ones, like the one Calhoun had seen decaying\nin a florist's shop which had had to be grown in a cage--the\nground-cover plants had motile stems and leaves and blossoms. They\nwere cannibals. They could move their stems to reach, and their\nleaves to enclose, and their flowers to devour other plants, even\nperhaps small animals. The point, though, was that they had some\nlimited power of motion. Earth-style sensitive vines and flycatcher\nplants had primitive muscular tissues. The local ground-cover plants\nhad them too. And the cattle-fence field made those tissues contract\nspasmodically. Powerfully. Violently. Repeatedly. Until they died of\nexhaustion. The full-power cattle-fence field had exterminated Mayan\nground-cover plants all the way to the end of the east-bound highway.\nAnd inevitably--and very conveniently--also up to the exact spot where\nthe cattle-fence field had begun to be projected. There would be an\narrow-shaped narrowing of the wiped-out ground-cover plants where the\ncattle-field had been projected. It would narrow to a point which\npointed precisely to the cattle-fence projector.\n\n\"Your friends,\" said Calhoun, \"will probably give themselves up and ask\nfor mercy. There's not much else they can do.\"\n\nThen he said:\n\n\"They might even get it. D'you know, there's an interesting side effect\nof the cattle fence. It kills the plants that have kept Earth-type\ngrasses from growing here. Wheat can be grown here now, whenever and\nas much as the people please. It should make this a pretty prosperous\nplanet, not having to import all its bread.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe ground cars of the inhabitants of Maya City did begin to arrive at\nsunrise. Within an hour after daybreak, very savagely intent persons\nfound the projector and turned it off.\n\nBy noon there was still some anger on the faces of the people of Maya,\nbut there'd been little or no damage, and life took up its normal\ncourse again. Murgatroyd appreciated the fact that things went back to\nnormal. For him it was normal to be welcomed and petted when the Med\nShip _Esclipus Twenty_ touched ground. It was normal for him to move\nzestfully in admiring human society, and to drink coffee with great\ngusto.\n\nAnd while Murgatroyd moved in human society, enjoying himself hugely,\nCalhoun went about his business. Which, of course, was conferences with\nplanetary health officials, politely receiving such information as they\nthought important, and tactfully telling them about the most recent\ndevelopments in medical science.\n\nWhat else was a Med Ship man for?\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Med Ship Man, by Murray Leinster\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MED SHIP MAN ***\n\n***** This file should be named 50999.txt or 50999.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/0/9/9/50999/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations.

The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Newby\n    Chief Executive and Director\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
