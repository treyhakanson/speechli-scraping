The First Empire had conquered most\nof the known universe by political intrigue and sheer military strength;\nit had fallen because that same propensity for political intrigue had\ngained over every other strength of the Empire, and the various branches\nand sectors of the First Empire had begun to use it against one another.\n\nThe Second Empire was politically unlike the First; it tried to balance\na centralized government against the autonomic governments of the\nvarious sectors, and had almost succeeded in doing so.\n\nBut, no matter how governed, there are certain essentials which are\nneeded by any governmental organization.\n\nWithout power, neither Civilization nor the Empire could hold itself\ntogether, and His Universal Majesty, the Emperor Carl, well knew it. And\npower was linked solidly to one element, one metal, without which\nCivilization would collapse as surely as if it had been blasted out of\nexistence. Without the power metal, no ship could move or even be built;\nwithout it, industry would come to a standstill.\n\nIn ancient times, even as far back as the early Greek and Roman\ncivilizations, the metal had been known, but it had been used, for the\nmost part, as decoration and in the manufacture of jewelry. Later, it\nhad been coined as money.\n\nIt had always been relatively rare, but now, weight for weight, atom for\natom, it was the most valuable element on Earth. Indeed, the most\nvaluable in the known universe.\n\nThe metal was Element Number Seventy-nine--gold.\n\nTo the collective mind of the Empire, gold was the prime object in any\nkind of mining exploration. The idea of drilling for petroleum, even if\nit had been readily available, or of mining coal or uranium would have\nbeen dismissed as impracticable and even worse than useless.\n\nThroughout the Empire, research laboratories worked tirelessly at the\nproblem of transmuting commoner elements into Gold-197, but thus far\nnone of the processes was commercially feasible. There was still, after\nthousands of years, only one way to get the power metal: extract it from\nthe ground.\n\nSo it was that, across the great gulf between the worlds, ship after\nship moved in search of the metal that would hold the far-flung colonies\nof the Empire together. Every adventurer who could manage to get aboard\nwas glad to be cooped up on a ship during the long months it took to\ncross the empty expanses, was glad to endure the hardships on alien\nterrain, on the chance that his efforts might pay off a thousand or ten\nthousand fold.\n\nOf these men, a mere handful were successful, and of these one or two\nstand well above the rest. And for sheer determination, drive, and\ncourage, for the will to push on toward his goal, no matter what the\nodds, a certain Commander Frank had them all beat.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nBefore you can get a picture of the commander--that is, as far as his\npersonality goes--you have to get a picture of the man physically.\n\nHe was enough taller than the average man to make him stand out in a\ncrowd, and he had broad shoulders and a narrow waist to match. He wasn't\nheavy; his was the hard, tough, wirelike strength of a steel cable. The\nplanes of his tanned face showed that he feared neither exposure to the\nelements nor exposure to violence; it was seamed with fine wrinkles and\nthe thin white lines that betray scar tissue. His mouth was\nheavy-lipped, but firm, and the lines around it showed that it was\nunused to smiling. The commander could laugh, and often did--a sort of\nroaring explosion that burst forth suddenly whenever something struck\nhim as particularly uproarious. But he seldom just smiled; Commander\nFrank rarely went halfway in anything.\n\nHis eyes, like his hair, were a deep brown--almost black, and they were\nset well back beneath heavy brows that tended to frown most of the time.\n\nPrimarily, he was a military man. He had no particular flair for\nscience, and, although he had a firm and deep-seated grasp of the\nessential philosophy of the Universal Assembly, he had no inclination\ntowards the kind of life necessarily led by those who would become\nhigher officers of the Assembly. It was enough that the Assembly was\nbehind him; it was enough to know that he was a member of the only race\nin the known universe which had a working knowledge of the essential,\nbasic Truth of the Cosmos. With a weapon like that, even an ordinary\nsoldier had little to fear, and Commander Frank was far from being an\nordinary soldier.\n\nHe had spent nearly forty of his sixty years of life as an\nexplorer-soldier for the Emperor, and during that time he'd kept his\neyes open for opportunity. Every time his ship had landed, he'd watched\nand listened and collected data. And now he knew.\n\nIf his data were correct--and he was certain that they were--he had\nfound his strike. All he needed was the men to take it.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nThe expedition had been poorly outfitted and undermanned from the\nbeginning. The commander had been short of money at the outset, having\nspent almost all he could raise on his own, plus nearly everything he\ncould beg or borrow, on his first two probing expeditions, neither of\nwhich had shown any real profit.\n\nBut they _had_ shown promise; the alien population of the target which\nthe commander had selected as his personal claim wore gold as ornaments,\nbut didn't seem to think it was much above copper in value, and hadn't\neven progressed to the point of using it as coinage. From the second\nprobing expedition, he had brought back two of the odd-looking aliens\nand enough gold to show that there must be more where that came from.\n\nThe old, hopeful statement, \"There's gold in them thar hills,\" should\nhave brought the commander more backing than he got, considering the\nEmpire's need of it and the commander's evidence that it was available;\nbut people are always more ready to bet on a sure thing than to indulge\nin speculation. Ten years before, a strike had been made in a sector\nquite distant from the commander's own find, and most of the richer\nnobles of the Empire preferred to back an established source of the\nmetal than to sink money into what might turn out to be the pursuit of\na wild goose.\n\nCommander Frank, therefore, could only recruit men who were willing to\ntake a chance, who were willing to risk anything, even their lives,\nagainst tremendously long odds.\n\nAnd, even if they succeeded, the Imperial Government would take twenty\nper cent of the gross without so much as a by-your-leave. There was no\nother market for the metal except back home, so the tax could not be\navoided; gold was no good whatsoever in the uncharted wilds of an alien\nworld.\n\nBecause of his lack of funds, the commander's expedition was not only\ndangerously undermanned, but illegally so. It was only by means of\nout-and-out trickery that he managed to evade the official inspection\nand leave port with too few men and too little equipment.\n\nThere wasn't a scientist worthy of the name in the whole outfit, unless\nyou call the navigator, Captain Bartholomew, an astronomer, which is\ncertainly begging the question. There was no anthropologist aboard to\nstudy the semibarbaric civilization of the natives; there was no\nbiologist to study the alien flora and fauna. The closest thing the\ncommander had to physicists were engineers who could take care of the\nship itself--specialist technicians, nothing more.\n\nThere was no need for armament specialists; each and every man was a\nsoldier, and, as far as his own weapons went, an ordnance expert. As far\nas Commander Frank was concerned, that was enough. It had to be.\n\nMining equipment? He took nothing but the simplest testing apparatus.\nHow, then, did he intend to get the metal that the Empire was screaming\nfor?\n\nThe commander had an answer for that, too, and it was as simple as it\nwas economical. The natives would get it for him.\n\nThey used gold for ornaments, therefore, they knew where the gold could\nbe found. And, therefore, they would bloody well dig it out for\nCommander Frank.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nDue to atmospheric disturbances, the ship's landing was several hundred\nmiles from the point the commander had originally picked for the\ndebarkation of his troops. That meant a long, forced march along the\ncoast and then inland, but there was no help for it; the ship simply\nwasn't built for atmospheric navigation.\n\nThat didn't deter the commander any. The orders rang through the ship:\n\"All troops and carriers prepare for landing!\"\n\nHalf an hour later, they were assembled outside the ship, fully armed\nand armored, and with full field gear. The sun, a yellow G-O star, hung\nhotly just above the towering mountains to the east. The alien air\nsmelled odd in the men's nostrils, and the weird foliage seemed to\nrustle menacingly. In the distance, the shrieks of alien fauna\noccasionally echoed through the air.\n\nA hundred and eighty-odd men and some thirty carriers stood under the\ntropic blaze for forty-five minutes while the commander checked over\ntheir equipment with minute precision. Nothing faulty or sloppy was\ngoing into that jungle with him if he could prevent it.\n\nWhen his hard eyes had inspected every bit of equipment, when he had\neither passed or ordered changes in the manner of its carrying or its\ncondition, when he was fully satisfied that every weapon was in\norder--then, and only then, did he turn his attention to the men\nthemselves.\n\nHe climbed atop a little hillock and surveyed them carefully, letting\nhis penetrating gaze pass over each man in turn. He stood there, his\nfists on his hips, with the sunlight gleaming from his burnished armor,\nfor nearly a full minute before he spoke.\n\nThen his powerful voice rang out over the assembled adventurers.\n\n\"My comrades-at-arms! We have before us a world that is ours for the\ntaking! It contains more riches than any man on Earth ever dreamed\nexisted, and those riches, too, are ours for the taking. It isn't going\nto be a picnic, and we all knew that when we came. There are dangers on\nevery side--from the natives, from the animals and plants, and from the\nclimate.\n\n\"But there is not one of these that cannot be overcome by the onslaught\nof brave, courageous, and determined men!\n\n\"Ahead of us, we will find the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse arrayed\nagainst our coming--Famine, Pestilence, War, and Death. Each and all of\nthese we must meet and conquer as brave men should, for at their end we\nwill find wealth and glory!\"\n\nA cheer filled the air, startling the animals in the forest into\nmomentary silence.\n\nThe commander stilled it instantly with a raised hand.\n\n\"Some of you know this country from our previous expeditions together.\nMost of you will find it utterly strange. And not one of you knows it as\nwell as I do.\n\n\"In order to survive, you must--and _will_--follow my orders to the\nletter--and beyond.\n\n\"First, as to your weapons. We don't have an unlimited supply of charges\nfor them, so there will be no firing of any power weapons unless\nabsolutely necessary. You have your swords and your pikes--use them.\"\n\nSeveral of the men unconsciously gripped the hafts of the long steel\nblades at their sides as he spoke the words, but their eyes never left\nthe commanding figure on the hummock.\n\n\"As for food,\" he continued, \"we'll live off the land. You'll find that\nmost of the animals are edible, but stay away from the plants unless I\ngive the O.K.\n\n\"We have a long way to go, but, by Heaven, I'm going to get us there\nalive! Are you with me?\"\n\nA hearty cheer rang from the throats of the men. They shouted the\ncommander's name with enthusiasm.\n\n\"All right!\" he bellowed. \"There is one more thing! Anyone who wants to\nstay with the ship can do so; anyone who feels too ill to make it should\nconsider it his duty to stay behind, because sick men will simply hold\nus up and weaken us more than if they'd been left behind. Remember,\nwe're not going to turn back as a body, and an individual would never\nmake it alone.\" He paused.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\nNot a man moved. The commander grinned--not with humor, but with\nsatisfaction. \"All right, then: let's move out.\"\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nOf them all, only a handful, including the commander, had any real\nknowledge of what lay ahead of them, and that knowledge only pertained\nto the periphery of the area the intrepid band of adventurers were\nentering. They knew that the aliens possessed a rudimentary\ncivilization--they did not, at that time, realize they were entering the\noutposts of a powerful barbaric empire--an empire almost as\nwell-organized and well-armed as that of First Century Rome, and, if\nanything, even more savage and ruthless.\n\nIt was an empire ruled by a single family who called themselves the\nGreat Nobles; at their head was the Greatest Noble--the Child of the Sun\nHimself. It has since been conjectured that the Great Nobles were\nmutants in the true sense of the word; a race apart from their subjects.\nIt is impossible to be absolutely sure at this late date, and the\ncommander's expedition, lacking any qualified geneticists or genetic\nengineers, had no way of determining--and, indeed, no real _interest_ in\ndetermining--whether this was or was not true. None the less, historical\nevidence seems to indicate the validity of the hypothesis.\n\nNever before--not even in ancient Egypt--had the historians ever seen a\nculture like it. It was an absolute monarchy that would have made any\nMedieval king except the most saintly look upon it in awe and envy. The\nRussians and the Germans never even approached it. The Japanese tried to\napproximate it at one time in their history, but they failed.\n\nSecure in the knowledge that theirs was the only civilizing force on the\nface of the planet, the race of the Great Nobles spread over the length\nof a great continent, conquering the lesser races as they went.\n\nPhysically, the Great Nobles and their lesser subjects were quite\nsimilar. They were, like the commander and his men, human in every sense\nof the word. That this argues some ancient, prehistoric migration across\nthe empty gulfs that separate the worlds cannot be denied, but when and\nhow that migration took place are data lost in the mists of time.\nHowever it may have happened, the fact remains that these people _were_\nhuman. As someone observed in one of the reports written up by one of\nthe officers: \"They could pass for Indians, except their skins are of a\ndecidedly redder hue.\"\n\nThe race of the Great Nobles held their conquered subjects in check by\nthe exercise of two powerful forces: religion and physical power of\narms. Like the feudal organizations of Medieval Europe, the Nobles had\nthe power of life and death over their subjects, and to a much greater\nextent than the European nobles had. Each family lived on an allotted\nparcel of land and did a given job. Travel was restricted to a radius of\na few miles. There was no money; there was no necessity for it, since\nthe government of the Great Nobles took all produce and portioned it out\nagain according to need. It was communism on a vast and--incomprehensible\nas it may seem to the modern mind--_workable_ scale. Their minds were as\ndifferent from ours as their bodies were similar; the concept \"freedom\"\nwould have been totally incomprehensible to them.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThey were sun-worshipers, and the Greatest Noble was the Child of the\nSun, a godling subordinate only to the Sun Himself. Directly under him\nwere the lesser Great Nobles, also Children of the Sun, but to a lesser\nextent. They exercised absolute power over the conquered peoples, but\neven they had no concept of freedom, since they were as tied to the\npeople as the people were tied to them. It was a benevolent\ndictatorship of a kind never seen before or since.\n\nAt the periphery of the Empire of the Sun-Child lived still unconquered\nsavage tribes, which the Imperial forces were in the process of slowly\ntaking over. During the centuries, tribe after tribe had fallen before\nthe brilliant leadership of the Great Nobles and the territory of the\nEmpire had slowly expanded until, at the time the invading Earthmen\ncame, it covered almost as much territory as had the Roman Empire at its\npeak.\n\nThe Imperial Army, consisting of upwards of fifty thousand troops, was\nextremely mobile in spite of the handicap of having no form of\ntransportation except their own legs. They had no cavalry; the only\nbeast of burden known to them--the flame-beasts--were too small to carry\nmore than a hundred pounds, in spite of their endurance. But the wide,\nsmooth roads that ran the length and breadth of the Empire enabled a\nmarching army to make good time, and messages carried by runners in\nrelays could traverse the Empire in a matter of days, not weeks.\n\nAnd into this tight-knit, well-organized, powerful barbaric world\nmarched Commander Frank with less than two hundred men and thirty\ncarriers.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nIt didn't take long for the men to begin to chafe under the constant\nstrain of moving through treacherous and unfamiliar territory. And the\nfirst signs of chafing made themselves apparent beneath their armor.\n\nEven the best designed armor cannot be built to be worn for an unlimited\nlength of time, and, at first, the men could see no reason for the\norder. They soon found out.\n\nOne evening, after camp had been made, one young officer decided that he\nhad spent his last night sleeping in full armor. It was bad enough to\nhave to march in it, but sleeping in it was too much. He took it off and\nstretched, enjoying the freedom from the heavy steel. His tent was a\nlong way from the center of camp, where a small fire flickered, and the\nsoft light from the planet's single moon filtered only dimly through the\njungle foliage overhead. He didn't think anyone would see him from the\ncommander's tent.\n\nThe commander's orders had been direct and to the point: \"You will wear\nyour armor at all times; you will march in it, you will eat in it, you\nwill sleep in it. During such times as it is necessary to remove a part\nof it, the man doing so will make sure that he is surrounded by at least\ntwo of his companions in full armor. There will be no exceptions to this\nrule!\"\n\nThe lieutenant had decided to make himself an exception.\n\nHe turned to step into his tent when a voice came out of the nearby\ndarkness.\n\n\"Hadn't you better get your steel plates back on before the commander\nsees you?\"\n\nThe young officer turned quickly to see who had spoken. It was another\nof the junior officers.\n\n\"Mind your own business,\" snapped the lieutenant.\n\nThe other grinned sardonically. \"And if I don't?\"\n\nThere had been bad blood between these two for a long time; it was an\nenmity that went back to a time even before the expedition had begun.\nThe two men stood there for a long moment, the light from the distant\nfire flickering uncertainly against their bodies.\n\nThe young officer who had removed his armor had not been foolish enough\nto remove his weapons too; no sane man did that in hostile territory.\nHis hand went to the haft of the blade at his side.\n\n\"If you say a single word--\"\n\nInstinctively, the other dropped his hand to his own sword.\n\n\"Stop! Both of you!\"\n\nAnd stop they did; no one could mistake the crackling authority in that\nvoice. The commander, unseen in the moving, dim light, had been circling\nthe periphery of the camp, to make sure that all was well. He strode\ntoward the two younger men, who stood silently, shocked into immobility.\nThe commander's sword was already in his hand.\n\n\"I'll spit the first man that draws a blade,\" he snapped.\n\nHis keen eyes took in the situation at a glance.\n\n\"Lieutenant, what are you doing out of armor?\"\n\n\"It was hot, sir, and I--\"\n\n\"Shut up!\" The commander's eyes were dangerous. \"An asinine statement\nlike that isn't even worth listening to! Get that armor back on!\n_Move!_\"\n\nHe was standing approximately between the two men, who had been four or\nfive yards apart. When the cowed young officer took a step or two back\ntoward his tent, the commander turned toward the other officer. \"And as\nfor you, if--\"\n\nHe was cut off by the yell of the unarmored man, followed by the sound\nof his blade singing from its sheath.\n\nThe commander leaped backwards and spun, his own sword at the ready, his\nbody settling into a swordsman's crouch.\n\nBut the young officer was not drawing against his superior. He was\nhacking at something ropy and writhing that squirmed on the ground as\nthe lieutenant's blade bit into it. Within seconds, the serpentine thing\ngave a convulsive shudder and died.\n\nThe lieutenant stepped back clumsily, his eyes glazing in the flickering\nlight. \"Dropped from th' tree,\" he said thickly. \"Bit me.\"\n\nHis hand moved to a dark spot on his chest, but it never reached its\ngoal. The lieutenant collapsed, crumpling to the ground.\n\nThe commander walked over, slammed the heel of his heavy boot hard down\non the head of the snaky thing, crushing it. Then he returned his blade\nto its sheath, knelt down by the young man, and turned him over on his\nface.\n\nThe commander's own face was grim.\n\nBy this time, some of the nearby men, attracted by the yell, had come\nrunning. They came to a stop as they saw the tableau before them.\n\nThe commander, kneeling beside the corpse, looked up at them. With one\nhand, he gestured at the body. \"Let this be a lesson to all of you,\" he\nsaid in a tight voice. \"This man died because he took off his armor.\nThat\"--he pointed at the butchered reptile--\"thing is full of as deadly\na poison as you'll ever see, and it can move like lightning. _But it\ncan't bite through steel!_\n\n\"Look well at this man and tell the others what you saw. I don't want to\nlose another man in this idiotic fashion.\"\n\nHe stood up and gestured.\n\n\"Bury him.\"\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nThey found, as they penetrated deeper into the savage-infested\nhinterlands of the Empire of the Great Nobles, that the armor fended off\nmore than just snakes. Hardly a day passed but one or more of the men\nwould hear the sharp _spang!_ of a blowgun-driven dart as it slammed\nineffectually against his armored back or chest. At first, some of the\nmen wanted to charge into the surrounding forest, whence the darts came,\nand punish the sniping aliens, but the commander would have none of it.\n\n\"Stick together,\" he ordered. \"They'll do worse to us if we're split up\nin this jungle. Those blowgun darts aren't going to hurt you as long as\nthey're hitting steel. Ignore them and keep moving.\"\n\nThey kept moving.\n\nAround them, the jungle chattered and muttered, and, occasionally,\nscreamed. Clouds of insects, great and small, hummed and buzzed through\nthe air. They subsided only when the drizzling rains came, and then\nlifted again from their resting places when the sun came out to raise\nsteamy vapors from the moist ground.\n\nIt was not an easy march. Before many days had passed, the men's feet\nwere cracked and blistered from the effects of fungus, dampness, and\nconstant marching. The compact military marching order which had\ncharacterized the first few days of march had long since deteriorated\ninto a straggling column, where the weaker were supported by the\nstronger.\n\nThree more men died. One simply dropped in his tracks. He was dead\nbefore anyone could touch him. Insect bite? Disease? No one knew.\n\nAnother had been even less fortunate. A lionlike carnivore had leaped on\nhim during the night and clawed him badly before one of his companions\nblasted the thing with a power weapon. Three days later, the wounded man\nwas begging to be killed; one arm and one leg were gangrenous. But he\ndied while begging, thus sparing any would-be executioner from an\nunpleasant duty.\n\nThe third man simply failed to show up for roll call one morning. He was\nnever seen again.\n\nBut the rest of the column, with dauntless courage, followed the lead of\ntheir commander.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was hard to read their expressions, those reddened eyes that peered\nat him from swollen, bearded faces. But he knew his own face looked no\ndifferent.\n\n\"We all knew this wasn't going to be a fancy-dress ball when we came,\"\nhe said. \"Nobody said this was going to be the easiest way in the world\nto get rich.\"\n\nThe commander was sitting on one of the carriers, his eyes watching the\nmen, who were lined up in front of him. His voice was purposely held\nlow, but it carried well.\n\n\"The marching has been difficult, but now we're really going to see what\nwe're made of.\n\n\"We all need a rest, and we all deserve one. But when I lie down to\nrest, I'm going to do it in a halfway decent bed, with some good, solid\nfood in my belly.\n\n\"Here's the way the picture looks: An hour's march from here, there's a\ngood-sized village.\" He swung partially away from them and pointed\nsouth. \"I think we have earned that town and everything in it.\"\n\nHe swung back, facing them. There was a wolfish grin on his face.\n\"There's gold there, too. Not much, really, compared with what we'll get\nlater on, but enough to whet our appetites.\"\n\nThe men's faces were beginning to change now, in spite of the swelling.\n\n\"I don't think we need worry too much about the savages that are living\nthere now. With God on our side, I hardly see how we can fail.\"\n\nHe went on, telling them how they would attack the town, the disposition\nof men, the use of the carriers, and so forth. By the time he was\nthrough, every man there was as eager as he to move in. When he finished\nspeaking, they set up a cheer:\n\n\"For the Emperor and the Universal Assembly!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe natives of the small village had heard that some sort of terrible\nbeings were approaching through the jungle. Word had come from the\npeople of the forest that the strange monsters were impervious to darts,\nand that they had huge dragons with them which were terrifying even to\nlook at. They were clad in metal and made queer noises as they moved.\n\nThe village chieftain called his advisers together to ponder the\nsituation. What should they do with these strange things? What were the\ninvaders' intentions?\n\nObviously, the things must be hostile. Therefore, there were only two\ncourses open--fight or flee. The chieftain and his men decided to fight.\nIt would have been a good thing if there had only been some Imperial\ntroops in the vicinity, but all the troops were farther south, where a\ncivil war was raging over the right of succession of the Greatest\nNoble.\n\nNevertheless, there were two thousand fighting men in the village--well,\ntwo thousand men at any rate, and they would certainly all fight,\nalthough some were rather young and a few were too old for any really\nhard fighting. On the other hand, it would probably not come to that,\nsince the strangers were outnumbered by at least three to one.\n\nThe chieftain gave his orders for the defense of the village.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe invading Earthmen approached the small town cautiously from the\nwest. The commander had his men spread out a little, but not so much\nthat they could be separated. He saw the aliens grouped around the\nsquare, boxlike buildings, watching and waiting for trouble.\n\n\"We'll give them trouble,\" the commander whispered softly. He waited\nuntil his troops were properly deployed, then he gave the signal for the\ncharge.\n\nThe carriers went in first, thundering directly into the massed alien\nwarriors. Each carrier-man fired a single shot from his power weapon,\nand then went to work with his carrier, running down the terrified\naliens, and swinging a sword with one hand while he guided with the\nother. The commander went in with that first charge, aiming his own\ncarrier toward the center of the fray. He had some raw, untrained men\nwith him, and he believed in teaching by example.\n\nThe aliens recoiled at the onslaught of what they took to be horrible\nliving monsters that were unlike anything ever seen before.\n\nThen the commander's infantry charged in. The shock effect of the\ncarriers had been enough to disorganize the aliens, but the battle was\nnot over yet by a long shot.\n\nThere were yells from other parts of the village as some of the other\ndefenders, hearing the sounds of battle, came running to reinforce the\nhome guard. Better than fifteen hundred men were converging on the spot.\n\nThe invading Earthmen moved in rapidly against the armed natives,\nbeating them back by the sheer ferocity of their attack. Weapons of\nsteel clashed against weapons of bronze and wood.\n\nThe power weapons were used only sparingly; only when the necessity to\nsave a life was greater than the necessity to conserve weapon charges\nwas a shot fired.\n\nThe commander, from the center of the fray, took a glance around the\narea. One glance was enough.\n\n\"They're dropping back!\" he bellowed, his voice carrying well above the\ndin of the battle, \"Keep 'em moving!\" He singled out one of his officers\nat a distance, and yelled: \"Hernan! Get a couple of men to cover that\nstreet!\" He waved toward one of the narrow streets that ran off to one\nside. The others were already being attended to.\n\nThe commander jerked around swiftly as one of the natives grabbed hold\nof the carrier and tried to hack at the commander with a bronze sword.\nThe commander spitted him neatly on his blade and withdrew it just in\ntime to parry another attack from the other side.\n\nBy this time, the reinforcements from the other parts of the village\nwere beginning to come in from the side streets, but they were a little\nlate. The warriors in the square--what was left of them--had panicked.\nIn an effort to get away from the terrible monsters with their deadly\nblades and their fire-spitting weapons, they were leaving by the same\nchannels that the reinforcements were coming in by, and the resultant\njam-up was disastrous. The panic communicated itself like wildfire, but\nno one could move fast enough to get away from the sweeping, stabbing,\nglittering blades of the invading Earthmen.\n\n\"All right,\" the commander yelled, \"we've got 'em on the run now! Break\nup into squads of three and clear those streets! Clear 'em out! Keep 'em\nmoving!\"\n\nAfter that, it was the work of minutes to clear the town.\n\nThe commander brought his carrier to a dead stop, reached out with his\nsword, and snagged a bit of cloth from one of the fallen native\nwarriors. He began to wipe the blade of his weapon as Lieutenant\ncommander Hernan pulled up beside him.\n\n\"Casualties?\" the commander asked Hernan without looking up from his\nwork.\n\n\"Six wounded, no dead,\" said Hernan. \"Or did you want me to count the\naliens, too?\"\n\nThe commander shook his head. \"No. Get a detail to clear out the\ncarrion, and then tell Frater Vincent I want to talk to him. We'll have\nto start teaching these people the Truth.\"\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\n\"Have you anything to say in your defense?\" the commander asked coldly.\n\nFor a moment, the accused looked nothing but hatred at the commander,\nbut there was fear behind that hatred. At last he found his voice. \"It\nwas mine. You promised us all a share.\"\n\nLieutenant commander Hernan picked up a leather bag that lay on the\ntable behind which he and the commander were sitting. With a sudden\ngesture, he upended it, dumping its contents on the flat, wooden surface\nof the table.\n\n\"Do you deny that this was found among your personal possessions?\" he\nasked harshly.\n\n\"No,\" said the accused soldier. \"Why should I? It's mine. Rightfully\nmine. I fought for it. I found it. I kept it. It's mine.\" He glanced to\neither side, towards the two guards who flanked him, then looked back at\nthe commander.\n\nThe commander ran an idle finger through the pound or so of golden\ntrinkets that Hernan had spilled from the bag. He knew what the trooper\nwas thinking. A man had a right to what he had earned, didn't he?\n\nThe commander picked up one of the heavier bits of primitive jewelry and\ntossed it in his hand. Then he stood up and looked around the town\nsquare.\n\nThe company had occupied the town for several weeks. The stored grains\nin the community warehouse, plus the relaxation the men had had, plus\nthe relative security of the town, had put most of the men back into\ncondition. One had died from a skin infection, and another from wounds\nsustained in the assault on the town, but the remainder were in good\nhealth.\n\nAnd all of them, with the exception of the sentries guarding the town's\nperimeter, were standing in the square, watching the court-martial.\nTheir eyes didn't seem to blink, and their breathing was soft and\nmeasured. They were waiting for the commander's decision.\n\nThe commander, still tossing the crude golden earring, stood tall and\nstraight, estimating the feeling of the men surrounding him.\n\n\"Gold,\" he said finally. \"Gold. That's what we came here for, and that's\nwhat we're going to get. Five hundred pounds of the stuff would make any\none of you wealthy for the rest of his life. Do you think I blame any\none of you for wanting it? Do you think I blame this man here? Of course\nnot.\" He laughed--a short, hard bark. \"Do I blame myself?\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nHe tossed the bauble again, caught it. \"But wanting it is one thing;\ngetting it, holding it, and taking care of it wisely are something else\nagain.\n\n\"I gave orders. I have expected--and still expect--that they will be\nobeyed. But I didn't give them just to hear myself give orders. There\nwas a reason, and a good one.\n\n\"Suppose we let each man take what gold he could find. What would\nhappen? The lucky ones would be wealthy, and the unlucky would still be\npoor. And then some of the lucky ones would wake up some morning without\nthe gold they'd taken because someone else had relieved them of it while\nthey slept.\n\n\"And others wouldn't wake up at all, because they'd be found with their\nthroats cut.\n\n\"I told you to bring every bit of the metal to me. When this thing is\nover, every one of you will get his share. If a man dies, his share will\nbe split among the rest, instead of being stolen by someone else or lost\nbecause it was hidden too well.\"\n\nHe looked at the earring in his hand, then, with a convulsive sweep of\nhis arm, he tossed it out into the middle of the square.\n\n\"There! Seven ounces of gold! Which of you wants it?\"\n\nSome of the men eyed the circle of metal that gleamed brightly on the\nsunlit ground, but none of them made any motion to pick it up.\n\n\"So.\" The commander's voice was almost gentle. He turned his eyes back\ntoward the accused. \"You know the orders. You knew them when you hid\nthis.\" He gestured negligently toward the small heap of native-wrought\nmetal. \"Suppose you'd gotten away with it. You'd have ended up with your\nown share, _plus_ this, thereby cheating the others out of--\" He glanced\nat the pile. \"Hm-m-m--say, twenty-five each. And that's only a little\ncompared with what we'll get from now on.\"\n\nHe looked back at the others. \"Unless the shares are taken care of _my_\nway, the largest shares will go to the dishonest, the most powerful, and\nthe luckiest. Unless the division is made as we originally agreed, we'll\nend up trying to cut each other's heart out.\"\n\nThere was hardness in his voice when he spoke to the accused, but there\nwas compassion there, too.\n\n\"First: You have forfeited your share in this expedition. All that you\nhave now, and all that you might have expected will be divided among the\nothers according to our original agreement.\n\n\"Second: I do not expect any man to work for nothing. Since you will not\nreceive anything from this expedition, there is no point in your\nassisting the rest of us or working with us in any way whatsoever.\n\n\"Third: We can't have anyone with us who does not carry his own weight.\"\n\nHe glanced at the guards. \"Hang him.\" He paused. \"Now.\"\n\nAs he was led away, the commander watched the other men. There was\napproval in their eyes, but there was something else there, too--a\nwariness, a concealed fear.\n\nThe condemned man turned suddenly and began shouting at the commander,\nbut before he could utter more than three syllables, a fist smashed him\ndown. The guards dragged him off.\n\n\"All right, men,\" said the commander carefully, \"let's search the\nvillage. There might be more gold about; I have a hunch that this isn't\nall he hid. Let's see if we can find the rest of it.\" He sensed the\nrelief of tension as he spoke.\n\nThe commander was right. It was amazing how much gold one man had been\nable to stash away.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\nThey couldn't stay long in any one village; they didn't have the time to\nsit and relax any more than was necessary. Once they had reached the\nnorthern marches of the native empire, it was to the commander's\nadvantage to keep his men moving. He didn't know for sure how good or\nhow rapid communications were among the various native provinces, but he\nhad to assume that they were top notch, allowing for the limitations of\na barbaric society.\n\nThe worst trouble they ran into on their way was not caused by the\nnative warriors, but by disease.\n\nThe route to the south was spotted by great strips of sandy barrenness,\ntorn by winds that swept the grains of sand into the troopers' eyes and\ncrept into the chinks of their armor. Underfoot, the sand made a\ntreacherous pathway; carriers and men alike found it heavy going.\n\nThe heat from the sun was intense; the brilliant beams from the primary\nseemed to penetrate through the men's armor and through the insulation\nunderneath, and made the marching even harder.\n\nEven so, in spite of the discomfort, the men were making good time until\nthe disease struck. And that stopped them in their tracks.\n\nWhat the disease was or how it was spread is unknown and unknowable at\nthis late date. Virus or bacterium, amoeba or fungus--whatever it was,\nit struck.\n\nSymptoms: Lassitude, weariness, weakness, and pain.\n\nSigns: Great, ulcerous, wartlike, blood-filled blisters that grew\nrapidly over the body.\n\nA man might go to sleep at night feeling reasonably tired, but not ill,\nand wake up in the morning to find himself unable to rise, his muscles\ntoo weak to lift him from his bed.\n\nIf the blisters broke, or were lanced, it was almost impossible to stop\nthe bleeding, and many died, not from the toxic effect of the disease\nitself, but from simple loss of blood.\n\nBut, like many epidemics, the thing had a fairly short life span. After\ntwo weeks, it had burned itself out. Most of those who got it recovered,\nand a few were evidently immune.\n\nEighteen men remained behind in shallow graves.\n\nThe rest went on.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nNo man is perfect. Even with four decades of training behind him,\nCommander Frank couldn't call the turn every time. After the first few\nvillages, there were no further battles. The natives, having seen what\nthe invaders could do, simply showed up missing when the commander and\nhis men arrived. The villages were empty by the time the column reached\nthe outskirts.\n\nFrater Vincent, the agent of the Universal Assembly, complained in no\nuncertain terms about this state of affairs.\n\n\"As you know, commander,\" he said frowningly one morning, \"it's no use\ntrying to indoctrinate a people we can't contact. And you can't subject\na people by force of arms alone; the power of the Truth--\"\n\n\"I know, Frater,\" the commander interposed quickly. \"But we can't deal\nwith these savages in the hinterlands. When we get a little farther into\nthis barbarian empire, we can take the necessary steps to--\"\n\n\"The Truth,\" Frater Vincent interrupted somewhat testily, \"is for all\nmen. It works, regardless of the state of civilization of the society.\"\n\nThe commander looked out of the unglazed window of the native hut in\nwhich he had established his temporary headquarters, in one of the many\nvillages he had taken--or, rather, walked into without a fight because\nit was empty. \"But you'll admit, Frater, that it takes longer with\nsavages.\"\n\n\"True,\" said Frater Vincent.\n\n\"We simply haven't the time. We've got to keep on the move. And,\nbesides, we haven't even been able to contact any of the natives for\nquite a while; they get out of our way. And we have taken a few\nprisoners--\" His voice was apologetic, but there was a trace of\nirritation in it. He didn't want to offend Frater Vincent, of course,\nbut dammit, the Assemblyman didn't understand military tactics at all.\nOr, he corrected himself hastily, at least only slightly.\n\n\"Yes,\" admitted Frater Vincent, \"and I've had considerable success with\nthe prisoners. But, remember--we're not here just to indoctrinate a few\noccasional prisoners, but to change the entire moral and philosophical\nviewpoint of an entire race.\"\n\n\"I realize that, Frater,\" the commander admitted. He turned from the\nwindow and faced the Assemblyman. \"We're getting close to the Great Bay\nnow. That's where our ship landed on the second probing expedition. I\nexpect we'll be more welcome there than we have been, out here in the\ncountryside. We'll take it easy, and I think you'll have a chance to\nwork with the natives on a mass basis.\"\n\nThe Frater smiled. \"Excellent, commander. I ... uh ... want you to\nunderstand that I'm not trying to tell you your business; you run this\ncampaign as you see fit. But don't lose sight of the ultimate goal of\nlife.\"\n\n\"I won't. How could I? It's just that my methods are not, perhaps, as\nrefined as yours.\"\n\nFrater Vincent nodded, still smiling. \"True. You are a great deal more\ndirect. And--in your own way--just as effective. After all, the Assembly\ncould not function without the military, but there were armies long\nbefore the Universal Assembly came into being.\"\n\nThe commander smiled back. \"Not any armies like this, Frater.\"\n\nFrater Vincent nodded. The understanding between the two men--at least\non that point--was tacit and mutual. He traced a symbol in the air and\nleft the commander to his thoughts.\n\nMentally, the commander went through the symbol-patterns that he had\nlearned as a child--the symbol-patterns that brought him into direct\ncontact with the Ultimate Power, the Power that controlled not only the\nspinning of atoms and the whirling of electrons in their orbits, but the\nworkings of probability itself.\n\nOnce indoctrinated into the teachings of the Universal Assembly, any man\ncould tap that Power to a greater or lesser degree, depending on his\nmental control and ethical attitude. At the top level, a first-class\nadept could utilize that Power for telepathy, psychokinesis, levitation,\nteleportation, and other powers that the commander only vaguely\nunderstood.\n\nHe, himself, had no such depth of mind, such iron control over his will,\nand he knew he'd never have it. But he could and did tap that Power to\nthe extent that his physical body was under near-perfect control at all\ntimes, and not even the fear of death could shake his determination to\nwin or his great courage.\n\nHe turned again to the window and looked at the alien sky. There was a\ngreat deal yet to be done.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe commander needed information--needed it badly. He had to know what\nthe government of the alien empire was doing. Had they been warned of\nhis arrival? Surely they must have, and yet they had taken no steps to\nimpede his progress.\n\nFor this purpose, he decided to set up headquarters on an island just\noffshore in the Great Bay. It was a protected position, easily defended\nfrom assault, and the natives, he knew from his previous visit, were\nfriendly.\n\nThey even helped him to get his men and equipment and the carriers\nacross on huge rafts.\n\nFrom that point, he began collecting the information he needed to invade\nthe central domains of the Greatest Noble himself. It seemed an ideal\nspot--not only protection-wise, but because this was the spot he had\noriginally picked for the landing of the ship. The vessel, which had\nreturned to the base for reinforcements and extra supplies, would be\naiming for the Great Bay area when she came back. And there was little\nlikelihood that atmospheric disturbances would throw her off course\nagain; Captain Bartholomew was too good a man to be fooled twice.\n\nBut landing on that island was the first--and only--mistake the\ncommander made during the campaign. The rumors of internal bickerings\namong the Great Nobles of the barbarian empire were not the only rumors\nhe heard. News of more local treachery came to his ears through the\nagency of natives, now loyal to the commander, who had been\nindoctrinated into the philosophy of the Assembly.\n\nA group of native chieftains had decided that the invading Earthmen were\ntoo dangerous to be allowed to remain on their island, in spite of the\nfact that the invaders had done them no harm. There were, after all,\nwhisperings from the north, whence the invaders had come, that the\narmored beings with the terrible weapons had used their power more than\nonce during their march to the south. The chieftains were determined to\nrid their island of the potential menace.\n\nAs soon as the matter was brought to the commander's attention, he\nacted. He sent out a patrol to the place where the ringleaders were\nmeeting, arrested them, and sentenced them to death. He didn't realize\nwhat effect that action would have on the rest of the islanders.\n\nHe almost found out too late.\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\n\n\"There must be three thousand of them out there,\" said Lieutenant\ncommander Hernan tightly, \"and every one of them's crazy.\"\n\n\"Rot!\" The commander spat on the ground and then sighted again along the\nbarrel of his weapon. \"I'm the one who's crazy. I'm a lousy politician;\nthat's my trouble.\"\n\nThe lieutenant commander shrugged lightly. \"Anyone can make a mistake.\nJust chalk it up to experience.\"\n\n\"I will, when we get out of this mess.\" He watched the gathering natives\nthrough hard, slitted eyes.\n\nThe invading Earthmen were in a village at the southern end of the\neight-mile-long island, waiting inside the mud-brick huts while the\nnatives who had surrounded the village worked themselves into a frenzy\nfor an attack. The commander knew there was no sense in charging into\nthem at that point: they would simply scatter and reassemble. The only\nthing to do was wait until they attacked--and then smash the attack.\n\n\"Hernan,\" he said, his eyes still watching the outside, \"you and the\nothers get out there with the carriers after the first volley. Cut them\ndown. They're twenty-to-one against us, so make every blow count. Move.\"\n\nHernan nodded wordlessly and slipped away.\n\nThe natives were building up their courage with some sort of war dance,\nwhooping and screaming and making threatening gestures toward the\nembattled invaders. Then the pattern of the dance changed; the islanders\nwhirled to face the mud-brick buildings which housed the invading\nEarthmen. Suddenly, the dance broke, and the warriors ran in a\nscreaming charge, straight for the trapped soldiers.\n\nThe commander waited. His own shot would be the signal, and he didn't\nwant the men to fire too quickly. If the islanders were hit too soon,\nthey might fall back into the woods and set up a siege, which the little\ncompany couldn't stand. Better to mop up the natives now, if possible.\n\nCloser. Closer--\n\n_Now!_\n\nThe commander's first shot picked off one of the leaders in the front\nranks of the native warriors, and was followed by a raking volley from\nthe other power weapons, firing from the windows of the mud-brick\nbuildings. The warriors in the front rank dropped, and those in the\nsecond rank had to move adroitly to keep from stumbling over the bodies\nof their fallen fellows. The firing from the huts became ragged, but its\nraking effect was still deadly. A cloud of heavy, stinking smoke rolled\nacross the clearing between the edge of the jungle and the village, as\nthe bright, hard lances of heat leaped from the muzzles of the power\nweapons toward the bodies of the charging warriors.\n\nThe charge was gone from the commander's weapon, and he didn't bother to\nreplace it. As Hernan and his men charged into the melee with their\ncarriers, the commander went with them.\n\nAt the same time, the armored infantrymen came pouring out of the\nmud-brick houses, swinging their swords, straight into the mass of\nconfused native warriors. A picked group of sharpshooters remained\nbehind, in the concealment of the huts to pick off the warriors at the\nedge of the battle with their sporadic fire.\n\nThe commander's lips were moving a little as he formed the\nsymbol-patterns of power almost unconsciously; a lifetime of habit had\nburned them into his brain so deeply that he could form them\nautomatically while turning the thinking part of his mind to the\nbusiness at hand.\n\nHe soon found himself entirely surrounded by the alien warriors. Their\nbronze weapons glittered in the sunlight as they tried to fight off the\nonslaught of the invaders. And those same bronze weapons were sheared,\nnicked, blunted, bent, and broken as they met the harder steel of the\ncommander's sword.\n\nThen the unexpected happened. One of the warriors, braver than the rest,\nmade a grab for the commander's sword arm. At almost the same moment, a\nwarrior on the other side of the carrier aimed a spear thrust at his\nside.\n\nEither by itself would have been ineffectual. The spear clanged\nharmlessly from the commander's armor, and the warrior who had attempted\nto pull him from the carrier died before he could give much of a tug.\nBut the combination, plus the fact that the heavy armor was a little\nunwieldy, overbalanced him. He toppled to the ground with a clash of\nsteel as he and the carrier parted company.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nWithout a human hand at its controls, the carrier automatically moved\naway from the mass of struggling fighters and came to a halt well away\nfrom the battle.\n\nThe commander rolled as he hit and leaped to his feet, his sword moving\nin flickering arcs around him. The natives had no knowledge of effective\nswordplay. Like any barbarian, they conceived of a sword as a cutting\ninstrument rather than a thrusting one. They chopped with them, using\nsmall shields to protect their bodies as they tried to hack the\ncommander to bits.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut the commander had no desire to become mincemeat just yet. Five of\nthe barbarians were coming at him, their swords raised for a downward\nslash. The commander lunged forward with a straight stop-thrust aimed at\nthe groin of the nearest one. It came as a complete surprise to the\nwarrior, who doubled up in pain.\n\nThe commander had already withdrawn his blade and was attacking the\nsecond as the first fell. He made another feint to the groin and then\nchanged the aim of his point as the warrior tried to cover with his\nshield. A buckler is fine protection against a man who is trying to hack\nyou to death with a chopper, because a heavy cutting sword and a shield\nhave about the same inertia, and thus the same maneuverability. But the\nshield isn't worth anything against a light stabbing weapon. The\nwarrior's shield started downward and he was unable to stop it and\nreverse its direction before the commander's sword pierced his throat.\n\nTwo down, three to go. No, four. Another warrior had decided to join the\nlittle battle against the leader of the invading Earthmen.\n\nThe commander changed his tactics just slightly with the third man. He\nslashed with the tip of his blade against the descending sword-arm of\nhis opponent--a short, quick flick of his wrist that sheared through the\ninside of the wrist, severing tendons, muscles, veins and arteries as it\ncut to the bone. The sword clanged harmlessly off the commander's\nshoulder. A quick thrust, and the third man died.\n\nThe other three slowed their attack and began circling warily, trying to\nget behind the commander. Instead of waiting, he charged forward, again\ncutting at the sword arm of his adversary, severing fingers this time.\nAs the warrior turned, the commander's sword pierced his side.\n\nHow long it went on, he had no idea. He kept his legs and his sword-arm\nmoving, and his eyes ever alert for new foes as man after man dropped\nbeneath that snake-tonguing blade. Inside his armor, perspiration poured\nin rivulets down his skin, and his arms and legs began to ache, but not\nfor one second did he let up. He could not see what was going on, could\nnot tell the direction of the battle nor even allow his mind to wonder\nwhat was going on more than ten paces from him.\n\nAnd then, quite suddenly, it seemed, it was all over. Lieutenant\ncommander Hernan and five other men pulled up with their carriers, as if\nfrom nowhere, their weapons dealing death, clearing a space around their\ncommander.\n\n\"You hurt?\" bawled Hernan.\n\nThe commander paused to catch his breath. He knew there was a\nsword-slash across his face, and his right leg felt as though there was\na cut on it, but otherwise--\n\n\"I'm all right,\" he said. \"How's it going?\"\n\n\"They're breaking,\" Hernan told him. \"We'll have them scattered within\nminutes.\"\n\nEven as he spoke, the surge of battle moved away from them, toward the\nforest. The charge of the carriers, wreaking havoc on every side, had\nbroken up the battle formation the aliens had had; the flaming death\nfrom the horrible weapons of the invaders, the fearless courage of the\nfoot soldiers, and the steel-clad monsters that were running amuck among\nthem shattered the little discipline they had. Panicky, they lost their\nanger, which had taken them several hours to build up. They scattered,\nheading for the forest.\n\nShortly, the village was silent. Not an alien warrior was to be seen,\nsave for the hundreds of mute corpses that testified to the carnage that\nhad been wrought.\n\nSeveral of the commander's men had been wounded, and three had died.\nLieutenant commander Hernan had been severely wounded in the leg by a\nnative javelin, but the injury was a long way from being fatal.\n\nHernan gritted his teeth while his leg was being bandaged. \"The angels\nwere with us on that one,\" he said between winces.\n\nThe commander nodded. \"I hope they stick with us. We'll need 'em to get\noff this island.\"\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\n\nFor a while, it looked as though they were trapped on the island. The\nnatives didn't dare to attack again, but no hunting party was safe, and\nthe food supply was dropping. They had gotten on the island only by the\nhelp of the natives, who had ferried them over on rafts. But getting off\nwas another thing, now that the natives were hostile. Cutting down trees\nto build rafts might possibly be managed, but during the loading the\nlittle company would be too vulnerable to attack.\n\nThe commander was seated bleakly in the hut he had taken as his\nheadquarters, trying to devise a scheme for getting to the mainland,\nwhen the deadlock was finally broken.\n\nThere was a flurry of footsteps outside, a thump of heavy boots as one\nof the younger officers burst into the room.\n\n\"Commander!\" he yelled. \"Commander! Come outside!\"\n\nThe commander leaped to his feet. \"Another attack?\"\n\n\"No, sir! Come look!\"\n\nThe commander strode quickly to the door. His sight followed the line of\nthe young officer's pointing finger.\n\nThere, outlined against the blue of the sky, was a ship!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe news from home was encouraging, but it was a long way from being\nwhat the commander wanted. Another hundred men and more carriers had\nbeen added to the original company of now hardened veterans, and the\nrecruits, plus the protection of the ship's guns, were enough to enable\nthe entire party to leave the island for the mainland.\n\nBy this time, the commander had gleaned enough information from the\nnatives to be able to plan the next step in his campaign. The present\nGreatest Noble, having successfully usurped the throne from his\npredecessor, was still not in absolute control of the country. He had\nwon a civil war, but his rule was still too shaky to allow him to split\nup his armies, which accounted for the fact that, thus far, no action\nhad been taken by the Imperial troops against the invading Earthmen.\n\nThe commander set up a base on the mainland, near the coast, left a\nportion of his men there to defend it, and, with the remainder, marched\ninland to come to grips with the Greatest Noble himself.\n\nAs they moved in toward the heart of the barbarian empire, the men\nnoticed a definite change in the degree of civilization of the\nnatives--or, at least, in the degree of technological advancement.\nThere were large towns, not small villages, to be dealt with, and there\nwere highways and bridges that showed a knowledge of engineering\nequivalent to that of ancient Rome.\n\nThe engineers of the Empire of the Great Nobles were a long way above\nthe primitive. They could have, had they had any reason to, erected a\npyramid the equal of great Khufu's in size, and probably even more\nneatly constructed. Militarily speaking, the lack of knowledge of iron\nhampered them, but it must be kept in mind that a well-disciplined and\nreasonably large army, armed with bronze-tipped spears, bronze swords,\naxes, and maces, can make a formidable foe, even against a much better\nequipped group.\n\nThe Imperial armies were much better disciplined and much better armed\nthan any of the natives the commander had thus far dealt with, and there\nwere reputed to be more than ten thousand of them with the Greatest\nNoble in his mountain stronghold. Such considerations prompted the\ncommander to plan his strategy carefully, but they did not deter him in\nthe least. If he had been able to bring aircraft and perhaps a\nthermonuclear bomb or two for demonstration purposes, the attack might\nhave been less risky, but neither had been available to a man of his\nlimited means, so he had to work without them.\n\nBut now, he avoided fighting if at all possible. Working with Frater\nVincent, the commander worked to convince the natives on the fertile\nfarms and in the prosperous villages that he and his company were merely\nambassadors of good will--missionaries and traders. He and his men had\ncome in peace, and if they were received in peace, well and good. If not\n... well, they still had their weapons.\n\nThe commander was depending on the vagueness of the information that may\nhave filtered down from the north. The news had already come that the\ninvaders were fierce and powerful fighters, but the commander gave the\nimpression that the only reason any battles had taken place was because\nthe northern tribes had been truculent in the extreme. He succeeded\nfairly well; the natives he now met considered their brethren of the\nnorthern provinces to be little better than savages, and therefore to be\nexpected to treat strangers inhospitably and bring about their own ruin.\nThe southern citizens of the empire eyed the strangers with\napprehension, but they offered very little resistance. The commander and\nhis men were welcomed warily at each town, and, when they left, were bid\nfarewell with great relief.\n\nIt took a little time for the commander to locate the exact spot where\nthe Greatest Noble and his retinue were encamped. The real capital of\nthe empire was located even farther south, but the Greatest Noble was\nstaying, for the nonce, in a city nestled high in the mountains, well\ninland from the seacoast. The commander headed for the mountains.\n\nThe passage into the mountains wasn't easy. The passes were narrow and\ndangerous, and the weather was cold. The air became thinner at every\nstep. At eight thousand feet, mountain climbing in heavy armor becomes\nmore than just hard work, and at twelve thousand it becomes exhausting\ntorture. But the little company went on, sparked, fueled, and driven by\nthe personal force of their commander, who stayed in the vanguard, his\neyes ever alert for treachery from the surrounding mountains.\n\nWhen the surprise came, it was of an entirely different kind than he had\nexpected. The commander's carrier came over a little rise, and he\nbrought it to an abrupt halt as he saw the valley spread out beneath\nhim. He left the carrier, walked over to a boulder near the edge of the\ncliff, and looked down at the valley.\n\nIt was an elongated oval of verdant green, fifteen miles long by four\nwide, looking like an emerald set in the rocky granite of the\nsurrounding peaks that thrust upward toward the sky. The valley ran\nroughly north-and-south, and to his right, at the southern end, the\ncommander could see a city, although it was impossible to see anyone\nmoving in it at this distance.\n\nTo his left, he could see great clouds of billowing vapor that rolled\nacross the grassy plain--evidently steam from the volcanic hot springs\nwhich he had been told were to be found in this valley.\n\nBut, for the moment, it was neither the springs nor the city that\ninterested him most.\n\nIn the heart of the valley, spreading over acre after acre, were the\ntents and pavilions of a mighty army encampment. From the looks of it,\nthe estimate of thirty thousand troops which had been given him by\nvarious officials along the way was, if anything, too small.\n\nIt was a moment that might have made an ordinary man stop to think, and,\nhaving thought, to turn and go. But the commander was no ordinary man,\nand the sheer remorseless courage that had brought him this far wouldn't\nallow him to turn back. So far, he had kept the Greatest Noble off\nbalance with his advancing tactics; if he started to retreat, the\nGreatest Noble would realize that the invaders were not invincible, and\nwould himself advance to crush the small band of strangers.\n\nThe Greatest Noble had known the commander and his men were coming; he\nwas simply waiting, to find out what they were up to, confident that he\ncould dispose of them at his leisure. The commander knew that, and he\nknew he couldn't retreat now. There was no decision to be made,\nreally--only planning to be done.\n\nHe turned back from the boulder to face the officers who had come to\ntake a look at the valley.\n\n\"We'll go to the city first,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\nXIII\n\n\nThe heavy tread of the invaders' boots as they entered the central\nplaza of the walled city awakened nothing but echoes from the stone\nwalls that surrounded the plaza. Like the small villages they had\nentered farther north, the city seemed devoid of life.\n\nThere is nothing quite so depressing and threatening as a deserted city.\nThe windows in the walls of the buildings seemed like blank, darkened\neyes that watched--and waited. Nothing moved, nothing made a sound,\nexcept the troopers themselves.\n\nThe men kept close to the walls; there was no point in bunching up in\nthe middle of the square to be cut down by arrows from the windows of\nthe upper floors.\n\nThe commander ordered four squads of men to search the buildings and\nsmoke out anyone who was there, but they turned up nothing. The entire\ncity was empty. And there were no traps, no ambushes--nothing.\n\nThe commander, with Lieutenant commander Hernan and another officer,\nclimbed to the top of the central building of the town. In the distance,\nseveral miles away, they could see the encampment of the monarch's\ntroops.\n\n\"The only thing we can do,\" the commander said, his face hard and\ndetermined, \"is to call their bluff. You two take about three dozen men\nand go out there with the carriers and give them a show. Go right into\ncamp, as if you owned the place. Throw a scare into them, but don't hurt\nanyone. Then, very politely, tell the Emperor, or whatever he calls\nhimself, that I would like him to come here for dinner and a little\ntalk.\"\n\nThe two officers looked at each other, then at the commander.\n\n\"Just like that?\" asked Hernan.\n\n\"Just like that,\" said the commander.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe demonstration and exhibition went well--as far as it had gone. The\nnative warriors had evidently been quite impressed by the onslaught of\nthe terrifying monsters that had thundered across the plain toward them,\nright into the great camp, and come to a dead halt directly in front of\nthe magnificent pavilion of the Greatest Noble himself.\n\nThe Greatest Noble put up a good face. He had obviously been expecting\nthe visitors, because he and his lesser nobles were lined up before the\npavilion, the Greatest Noble ensconced on a sort of portable throne. He\nmanaged to look perfectly calm and somewhat bored by the whole affair,\nand didn't seem to be particularly effected at all when Lieutenant\ncommander Hernan bowed low before him and requested his presence in the\ncity.\n\nAnd the Greatest Noble's answer was simple and to the point, although it\nwas delivered by one of his courtiers.\n\n\"You may tell your commander,\" said the noble, \"that His Effulgence must\nattend to certain religious duties tonight, since he is also High\nPriest of the Sun. However, His Effulgence will most graciously deign to\nspeak to your commander tomorrow. In the meantime, you are requested to\nenjoy His Effulgence's gracious hospitality in the city, which has been\nemptied for your convenience. It is yours, for the nonce.\"\n\nWhich left nothing for the two officers and their men to do but go\nthundering back across the plain to the city.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Greatest Noble did not bring his whole army with him, but the\npageant of barbaric splendor that came tootling and drumming its way\ninto the city the next evening was a magnificent sight. His Effulgence\nhimself was dressed in a scarlet robe and a scarlet, turbanlike head\ncovering with scarlet fringes all around it. About his throat was a\nnecklace of emerald-green gems, and his clothing was studded with more\nof them. Gold gleamed everywhere. He was borne on an ornate, gilded\npalanquin, carried high above the crowd on the shoulders of a dozen\nstalwart nobles, only slightly less gorgeously-dressed than the Greatest\nNoble. The nobility that followed was scarcely less showy in its finery.\n\nWhen they came into the plaza, however, the members of the procession\ncame to a halt. The singing and music died away.\n\nThe plaza was absolutely empty.\n\nNo one had come out to greet the Emperor.\n\nThere were six thousand natives in the plaza, and not a sign of the\ninvaders.\n\nThe commander, hiding well back in the shadows in one of the rooms of\nthe central building, watched through the window and noted the evident\nconsternation of the royal entourage with satisfaction. Frater Vincent,\nstanding beside him, whispered, \"Well?\"\n\n\"All right,\" the commander said softly, \"they've had a taste of what we\ngot when we came in. I suppose they've had enough. Let's go out and act\nlike hosts.\"\n\nThe commander and a squad of ten men, along with Frater Vincent, strode\nmajestically out of the door of the building and walked toward the\nGreatest Noble. They had all polished their armor until it shone, which\nwas about all they could do in the way of finery, but they evidently\nlooked quite impressive in the eyes of the natives.\n\n\"Greetings, Your Effulgence,\" said the commander, giving the Greatest\nNoble a bow that was hardly five degrees from the perpendicular. \"I\ntrust we find you well.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the buildings surrounding the square, hardly daring to move for fear\nthe clank of metal on metal might give the whole plan away, the\nremaining members of the company watched the conversation between their\ncommander and the Greatest Noble. They couldn't hear what was being\nsaid, but that didn't matter; they knew what to do as soon as the\ncommander gave the signal. Every eye was riveted on the commander's\nright hand.\n\nIt seemed an eternity before the commander casually reached up to his\nhelmet and brushed a hand across it--once--twice--three times.\n\nThen all hell broke loose. The air was split by the sound of power\nweapons throwing their lances of flame into the massed ranks of the\nnative warriors. The gunners, safe behind the walls of the buildings,\npoured a steady stream of accurately directed fire into the packed mob,\nwhile the rest of the men charged in with their blades, thrusting and\nslashing as they went.\n\nThe aliens, panic-stricken by the sudden, terrifying assault, tried to\nrun, but there was nowhere to run to. Every exit had been cut off to\nbottle up the Imperial cortege. Within minutes, the entrances to the\nsquare were choked with the bodies of those who tried to flee.\n\nAs soon as the firing began, the commander and his men began to make\ntheir way toward the Greatest Noble. They had been forced to stand a\ngood five yards away during the parlay, cut off from direct contact by\nthe Imperial guards. The commander, sword in hand, began cutting his way\nthrough to the palanquin.\n\nThe palanquin bearers seemed frozen; they couldn't run, they couldn't\nfight, and they didn't dare drop their precious cargo.\n\nThe commander's voice bellowed out over the carnage. \"Take him prisoner!\nI'll personally strangle the idiot who harms him!\" And then he was too\nbusy to yell.\n\nTwo members of the Greatest Noble's personal guard came for him, swords\nout, determined to give their lives, if necessary, to preserve the\nsacred life of their monarch. And give them they did.\n\nThe commander's blade lashed out once, sliding between the ribs of the\nfirst guard. He toppled and almost took the sword with him, but the\ncommander wrenched it free in time to parry the downward slash of the\nsecond guard's bronze sword. It was a narrow thing, because the bronze\nsword, though of softer stuff than the commander's steel, was also\nheavier, and thus hard to deflect. As it sang past him, the commander\nswung a chop at the man's neck, cutting it halfway through. He stepped\nquickly to one side to avoid the falling body and thrust his blade\nthrough a third man, who was aiming a blow at the neck of one of the\ncommander's officers. There were only a dozen feet separating the\ncommander from his objective, the palanquin of the Greatest Noble, but\nhe had to wade through blood to get there.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe palanquin itself was no longer steady. Three of the twelve nobles\nwho had been holding it had already fallen, and there were two of the\ncommander's men already close enough to touch the royal person, but they\nwere too busy fighting to make any attempt to grab him. The Greatest\nNoble, unarmed, could only huddle in his seat, terrified, but it would\ntake more than two men to snatch him from his bodyguard. The commander\nfought his way in closer.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nTwo more of the palanquin bearers went down, and the palanquin itself\nbegan to topple. The Greatest Noble screamed as he fell toward the\ncommander.\n\nOne of the commander's men spun around as he heard the scream so close\nto him, and, thinking that the Greatest Noble was attacking his\ncommander, lunged out with his blade.\n\nIt was almost a disaster. Moving quickly, the commander threw out his\nleft arm to deflect the sword. He succeeded, but he got a bad slash\nacross his hand for his trouble.\n\nHe yelled angrily at the surprised soldier, not caring what he said.\nMeanwhile, the others of the squad, seeing that the Greatest Noble had\nfallen, hurried to surround him. Two minutes later, the Greatest Noble\nwas a prisoner, being half carried, half led into the central building\nby four of the men, while the remaining six fought a rear-guard action\nto hold off the native warriors who were trying to rescue the sacred\nperson of the Child of the Sun.\n\nOnce inside, the Greatest Noble was held fast while the doors were swung\nshut.\n\nOutside, the slaughter went on. All the resistance seemed to go out of\nthe warriors when they saw their sacred monarch dragged away by the\ninvading Earthmen. It was every man for himself and the Devil take the\nhindmost. And the Devil, in the form of the commander's troops,\ncertainly did.\n\nWithin half an hour after it had begun, the butchery was over. More than\nthree thousand of the natives had died, and an unknown number more badly\nwounded. Those who had managed to get out and get away from the city\nkept on going. They told the troops who had been left outside what had\nhappened, and a mass exodus from the valley began.\n\nSafely within the fortifications of the central building, the commander\nallowed himself one of his rare grins of satisfaction. Not a single one\nof his own men had been killed, and the only wound which had been\nsustained by anyone in the company was the cut on his own hand. Still\nsmiling, he went into the room where the Greatest Noble, dazed and\nshaken, was being held by two of the commander's men. The commander\nbowed--this time, very low.\n\n\"I believe, Your Effulgence, that we have an appointment for dinner.\nCome, the banquet has been laid.\"\n\nAnd, as though he were still playing the gracious host, the commander\nled the half-paralyzed Child of the Sun to the room where the banquet\nhad been put on a table in perfect diplomatic array.\n\n\"Your Effulgence may sit at my right hand,\" said the commander\npleasantly.\n\n\n\n\nXIV\n\n\nAs MacDonald said of Robert Wilson, \"This is not an account of how\nBoosterism came to Arcadia.\" It's a devil of a long way from it. And\nonce the high point of a story has been reached and passed, it is\npointless to prolong it too much. The capture of the Greatest Noble\nbroke the power of the Empire of the Great Nobles forever. The loyal\nsubjects were helpless without a leader, and the disloyal ones, near the\nperiphery of the Empire, didn't care. The crack Imperial troops simply\nfolded up and went home. The Greatest Noble went on issuing orders, and\nthey were obeyed; the people were too used to taking orders from\nauthority to care whether they were really the Greatest Noble's own idea\nor not.\n\nIn a matter of months, two hundred men had conquered an empire, with a\nloss of thirty-five or forty men. Eventually, they had to execute the\nold Greatest Noble and put his more tractable nephew on the throne, but\nthat was a mere incident.\n\nGold? It flowed as though there were an endless supply. The commander\nshipped enough back on the first load to make them all wealthy.\n\nThe commander didn't go back home to spend his wealth amid the luxuries\nof the Imperial court, even though Emperor Carl appointed him to the\nnobility. That sort of thing wasn't the commander's meat. There, he\nwould be a fourth-rate noble; here, he was the Imperial Viceroy,\nresponsible only to the distant Emperor. There, he would be nothing;\nhere, he was almost a king.\n\nTwo years after the capture of the Greatest Noble, he established a new\ncapital on the coast and named it Kingston. And from Kingston he ruled\nwith an iron hand.\n\nAs has been intimated, this was _not_ Arcadia. A year after the founding\nof Kingston, the old capital was attacked, burned, and almost fell under\nsiege, due to a sudden uprising of the natives under the new Greatest\nNoble, who had managed to escape. But the uprising collapsed because of\nthe approach of the planting season; the warriors had to go back home\nand plant their crops or the whole of the agriculture-based country\nwould starve--except the invading Earthmen.\n\nExcept in a few instances, the natives were never again any trouble.\n\nBut the commander--now the Viceroy--had not seen the end of his\ntroubles.\n\nHe had known his limitations, and realized that the governing of a whole\nplanet--or even one continent--was too much for one man when the\npopulation consists primarily of barbarians and savages. So he had\ndelegated the rule of a vast area to the south to another--a Lieutenant\ncommander James, known as \"One-Eye,\" a man who had helped finance the\noriginal expedition, and had arrived after the conquest.\n\nOne-Eye went south and made very small headway against the more barbaric\ntribes there. He did not become rich, and he did not achieve anywhere\nnear the success that the Viceroy had. So he came back north with his\narmy and decided to unseat the Viceroy and take his place. That was five\nyears after the capture of the Greatest Noble.\n\nOne-Eye took Center City, the old capital, and started to work his way\nnorthward, toward Kingston. The Viceroy's forces met him at a place\nknown as Salt Flats and thoroughly trounced him. He was captured, tried\nfor high treason, and executed.\n\nOne would think that the execution ended the threat of Lieutenant\ncommander James, but not so. He had a son, and he had had followers.\n\n\n\n\nXV\n\n\nNine years. Nine years since the breaking of a vast empire. It really\ndidn't seem like it. The Viceroy looked at his hands. They were veined\nand thin, and the callouses were gone. Was he getting soft, or just\ngetting old? A little bit--no, a _great deal_ of both.\n\nHe sat in his study, in the Viceregal Palace at Kingston, chewing over\nthe events of the past weeks. Twice, rumors had come that he was to be\nassassinated. He and two of his councilors had been hanged in effigy in\nthe public square not long back. He had been snubbed publicly by some of\nthe lesser nobles.\n\nHad he ruled harshly, or was it just jealousy? And was it, really, as\nsome said, caused by the Southerners and the followers of Young Jim?\n\nHe didn't know. And sometimes, it seemed as if it didn't matter.\n\nHere he was, sitting alone in his study, when he should have gone to a\npublic function. And he had stayed because of fear of assassination.\n\nWas it--\n\nThere was a knock at the door.\n\n\"Come in.\"\n\nA servant entered. \"Sir Martin is here, my lord.\"\n\nThe Viceroy got to his feet. \"Show him in, by all means.\"\n\nSir Martin, just behind the servant, stepped in, smiling, and the\nViceroy returned his smile. \"Well, everything went off well enough\nwithout you,\" said Sir Martin.\n\n\"Any sign of trouble?\"\n\n\"None, my lord; none whatsoever. The--\"\n\n\"Damn!\" the Viceroy interrupted savagely. \"I should have known! What\nhave I done but display my cowardice? I'm getting yellow in my old age!\"\n\nSir Martin shook his head. \"Cowardice, my lord? Nothing of the sort.\nPrudence, I should call it. By the by, the judge and a few others are\ncoming over.\" He chuckled softly. \"We thought we might talk you out of a\nmeal.\"\n\nThe Viceroy grinned widely. \"Nothing easier. I suspected all you\nhangers-on would come around for your handouts. Come along, my friend;\nwe'll have a drink before the others get here.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere were nearly twenty people at dinner, all, presumably, friends of\nthe Viceroy. At least, it is certain that they were friends in so far as\nthey had no part in the assassination plot. It was a gay party; the\nViceroy's friends were doing their best to cheer him up, and were\nsucceeding pretty well. One of the nobles, known for his wit, had just\nessayed a somewhat off-color jest, and the others were roaring with\nlaughter at the punch line when a shout rang out.\n\nThere was a sudden silence around the table.\n\n\"What was that?\" asked someone. \"What did--\"\n\n\"_Help!_\" There was the sound of footsteps pounding up the stairway from\nthe lower floor.\n\n\"_Help! The Southerners have come to kill the Viceroy!_\"\n\nFrom the sounds, there was no doubt in any of the minds of the people\nseated around the table that the shout was true. For a moment, there was\nshock. Then panic took over.\n\nThere were only a dozen or so men in the attacking party; if the\n\"friends\" of the Viceroy had stuck by him, they could have held off the\nassassins with ease.\n\nBut no one ran to lock the doors that stood between the Viceroy and his\nenemies, and only a few drew their weapons to defend him. The others\nfled. Getting out of a window from the second floor of a building isn't\neasy, but fear can lend wings, and, although none of them actually flew\ndown, the retreat went fast enough.\n\nCharacteristically, the Viceroy headed, not for the window, but for his\nown room, where his armor--long unused, except for state\nfunctions--hung waiting in the closet. With him went Sir Martin.\n\nBut there wasn't even an opportunity to get into the armor. The rebel\nband charged into the hallway that led to the bedroom, screaming:\n\"_Death to the Tyrant! Long live the Emperor!_\"\n\nIt was personal anger, then, not rebellion against the Empire which had\nappointed the ex-commander to his post as Viceroy.\n\n\"Where is the Viceroy? Death to the Tyrant!\" The assassins moved in.\n\nSwords in hand, and cloaks wrapped around their left arms, Sir Martin\nand the Viceroy moved to meet the oncoming attackers.\n\n\"Traitors!\" bellowed the Viceroy. \"Cowards! Have you come to kill me in\nmy own house?\"\n\nParry, thrust! Parry, thrust! Two of the attackers fell before the\nsnake-tongue blade of the fighting Viceroy. Sir Martin accounted for two\nmore before he fell in a flood of his own blood.\n\nThe Viceroy was alone, now. His blade flickered as though inspired, and\ntwo more died under its tireless onslaught. Even more would have died if\nthe head of the conspiracy, a supporter of Young Jim named Rada, hadn't\npulled a trick that not even the Viceroy would have pulled.\n\nRada grabbed one of his own men and shoved him toward the Viceroy's\nsword, impaling the hapless man upon that deadly blade.\n\nAnd, in the moment while the Viceroy's weapon was buried to the hilt in\nan enemy's body, the others leaped around the dying man and ran their\nblades through the Viceroy.\n\nHe dropped to the floor, blood gushing from half a dozen wounds.\n\nEven so, his fighting heart still had seconds more to beat. As he\npropped himself up on one arm, the assassins stood back; even they\nrecognized that they had killed something bigger and stronger than they.\nA better man than any of them lay dying at their feet.\n\nHe clawed with one hand at the river of red that flowed from his pierced\nthroat and then fell forward across the stone floor. With his crimson\nhand, he traced the great symbol of his Faith on the stone--the Sign of\nthe Cross. He bent his head to kiss it, and, with a final cry of\n\"_Jesus!_\" he died. At the age of seventy, it had taken a dozen men to\nkill him with treachery, something all the hell of nine years of\nconquest and rule had been unable to do.\n\nAnd thus died Francisco Pizarro, the Conqueror of Peru.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nTO BE READ AFTER YOU HAVE FINISHED \"DESPOILERS OF THE GOLDEN EMPIRE.\"\n\n\nDear John,\n\nIt has been brought to my attention, by those who have read the story,\nthat \"Despoilers of the Golden Empire\" might conceivably be charged with\nbeing a \"reader cheater\"--_i.e._, that it does not play fair with the\nreader, but leads him astray by means of false statements. Naturally, I\nfeel it me bounden duty to refute such scurrilous and untrue affronts,\nand thus save meself from opprobrium.\n\nTherefore, I address what follows to the interested reader:\n\nIt cannot be denied that you must have been misled when you read the\nstory; indeed, I'd be the last to deny it, since I _intended_ that you\nshould be misled. What I most certainly _do_ deny is any implication\nthat such misleading was accomplished by the telling of untruths. A\nfiction writer is, _by definition_, a professional liar; he makes his\nliving by telling interesting lies on paper and selling the results to\nthe highest bidder for publication. Since fiction writing is my\nlivelihood, I cannot and will not deny that I am an accomplished\nliar--indeed, almost an habitual one. Therefore, I feel some small pique\nwhen, on the one occasion on which I stick strictly to the truth, I am\naccused of fraud. _Pfui!_ say I; I refute you. \"I deny the allegation,\nand I defy the alligator!\"\n\nTo prove my case, I shall take several examples from \"Despoilers\" and\nshow that the statements made are perfectly valid. (Please note that I\ndo not claim any absolute accuracy for such details as quoted dialogue,\nexcept that none of the characters lies. I simply contend that the story\nis as accurate as any other good historical novelette. I also might say\nhere that any resemblance between \"Despoilers\" and any story picked at\nrandom from the late lamented _Planet Stories_ is purely intentional and\ncarefully contrived.)\n\nTake the first sentence:\n\n\"In the seven centuries that had elapsed since the Second Empire had\nbeen founded on the shattered remnants of the First, the nobles of the\nImperium had come slowly to realize that the empire was not to be judged\nby the examples of its predecessor.\"\n\nPerfectly true. By the time of the Renaissance, the nobles of the Holy\nRoman Empire knew that their empire was not just a continuation of the\nRoman Empire, but a new entity. The old Roman Empire had collapsed in\nthe Sixth Century, and the _Holy_ Roman Empire, which was actually a\nloose confederation of Germanic states, did not come into being until A.\nD. 800, when Karl der Grosse (Charlemagne) was crowned emperor by the\nPope.\n\nAnyone who wishes to quibble that the date should be postponed for a\ncentury and a half, until the time of the German prince, Otto, may do\nso; I will ignore him.\n\nA few paragraphs later, I said:\n\n\"Without power, neither Civilization nor the Empire could hold itself\ntogether, and His Universal Majesty, the Emperor Carl, well knew it. And\npower was linked solidly to one element, one metal ...\"\n\nThe metal, as I said later on, was Gold-197.\n\nBy \"power,\" of course, I meant political and economic power. In the\nSixteenth Century, that's what almost anyone would have meant. If you\nchose to interpret it as meaning \"energy per unit time,\" why, that's\nreal tough.\n\nWhy nail the \"power metal\" down to an isotope of gold with an atomic\nweight of 197? Because that's the only naturally occurring isotope of\ngold.\n\nThe \"Emperor Carl\" was, of course, Charles V, who also happened to be\nKing of Spain, and therefore Pizarro's sovereign. I Germanicized his\nname, as I did the others--Francisco Pizarro becomes \"Frank,\" et\ncetera--but this is perfectly legitimate. After all, the king's name in\nLatin, which was used in all state papers, was _Carolus_; the Spanish\ncalled him _Carlos_, and history books in English call him _Charles_.\nEither _Karl_ or _Carl_ is just as legitimate as _Charles_, certainly,\nand the same applies to the other names in the story.\n\nAs to the title \"His Universal Majesty,\" that's exactly what he _was_\ncalled. It is usually translated as \"His Catholic Majesty,\" but the word\n_Catholic_ comes from the Greek _katholikos_, meaning \"universal.\" And,\nfurther on in the story, when the term \"Universal Assembly\" is used, it\nis a direct translation of the Greek term, _Ekklesia Katholikos_, and is\nactually a better translation than \"Catholic Church,\" since the English\nword _church_ comes from the Greek _kyriakon_, meaning \"the house of the\nLord\"--in other words, a church _building_, not the organization as a\nwhole.\n\nToward the end of Chapter One, I wrote:\n\n\"Throughout the Empire, research laboratories worked tirelessly at the\nproblem of transmuting commoner elements into Gold-197, but thus far\nnone of the processes was commercially feasible.\"\n\nI think you will admit that the alchemists never found a method of\ntransmuting the elements--certainly none which was commercially\nfeasible.\n\nIn Chapter Three, the statement that Pizarro left his home--Spain--with\nundermanned ships, and had to sneak off illegally before the King's\ninspectors checked up on him, is historically accurate. And who can\nargue with the statement that \"there wasn't a scientist worthy of the\nname in the whole outfit\"?\n\nAt the beginning of Chapter Four, you'll find:\n\n\"Due to atmospheric disturbances, the ship's landing was several hundred\nmiles from the point the commander had originally picked ...\" and \"...\nthe ship simply wasn't built for atmospheric navigation.\"\n\nThe adverse winds which drove Pizarro's ships off course were certainly\n\"atmospheric disturbances,\" and I defy anyone to prove that a Sixteenth\nCentury Spanish galleon was built for atmospheric navigation.\n\nAnd I insist that using the term \"carrier\" instead of \"horse,\" while\nmisleading, is not inaccurate. However, I _would_ like to know just what\nsort of picture the term conjured up in the reader's mind. In Chapter\nTen, in the battle scene, you'll find the following:\n\n\"The combination [of attackers from both sides], plus the fact that the\nheavy armor was a little unwieldy, overbalanced him [the commander]. He\ntoppled to the ground with a clash of steel as he and the carrier parted\ncompany.\n\n\"Without a human hand at its controls, the carrier automatically moved\naway from the mass of struggling fighters and came to a halt well away\nfrom the battle.\"\n\nTo be perfectly honest, it's somewhat of a strain on my mind to imagine\nanyone building a robot-controlled machine as good as all that, and then\ngiving the drive such poor protection that he can fall off of it.\n\nOne of the great screams from my critics has been occasioned by the\nfact that I referred several times to the Spaniards as \"Earthmen.\" I\ncan't see why. In order not to confuse the reader, I invariably referred\nto them as the \"_invading_ Earthmen,\" so as to make a clear distinction\nbetween them and the _native_ Earthmen, or Incas, who were native to\nPeru. If this be treachery, then make the most of it.\n\nIn other words, I contend that I simply did what any other good\ndetective story writer tries to do--mislead the reader without lying to\nhim. Agatha Christie's \"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd,\" for instance, uses\nthe device of telling the story from the murderer's viewpoint, in the\nfirst person, without revealing that he _is_ the murderer. Likewise,\nJohn Dickson Carr, in his \"Nine Wrong Answers\" finds himself forced to\ndeny that he has lied to the reader, although he admits that one of his\ncharacters certainly lied. Both Carr and Christie told the absolute\ntruth--within the framework of the story--and left it to the reader to\ndelude himself.\n\nIt all depends on the viewpoint. The statement, \"We all liked Father\nGoodheart very much\" means one thing when said by a member of his old\nparish in the United States, which he left to become a missionary. It\nmeans something else again when uttered by a member of the tribe of\ncannibals which the good Father attempted unsuccessfully to convert.\n\nSimilarly, such terms as \"the gulf between the worlds,\" \"the new world,\"\nand \"the known universe\" have one meaning to a science-fictioneer, and\nanother to a historian. Semantics, anyone?\n\nIn Chapter Ten, right at the beginning, there is a conversation between\nCommander Frank and Frater Vincent, and \"agent of the Assembly\" (read:\n_priest_). If the reader will go back over that section, keeping in mind\nthe fact that what they are \"actually\" talking about are the Catholic\nChurch and the Christian religion _as seen from the viewpoint of a\ncouple of fanatically devout Sixteenth Century Spaniards_, he will\nunderstand the method I used in presenting the whole story.\n\nLet me quote:\n\n\"Mentally, the commander went through the symbol-patterns that he had\nlearned as a child--the symbol-patterns that brought him into direct\ncontact with the Ultimate Power, the Power that controlled not only the\nspinning of atoms and the whirling of electrons in their orbits, but the\nworkings of probability itself.\"\n\nObviously, he is reciting the _Pater Noster_ and the _Ave Maria_. The\nrest of the sentence is self-explanatory.\n\nSo is the following:\n\n\"Once indoctrinated into the teachings of the Universal Assembly, any\nman could tap that power to a greater or lesser degree, depending on his\nmental control and ethical attitude. At the top level, a first-class\nadept could utilize that Power for telepathy, psychokinesis, levitation,\nteleportation, and other powers that the commander only vaguely\nunderstood.\"\n\nIt doesn't matter whether _you_ believe in the miracles attributed to\nmany of the Saints; Pizarro certainly did. His faith in that Power was\nas certain as the modern faith in the power of the atomic bomb.\n\nAs a matter of fact, it was very probably that hard, unyielding Faith\nwhich made the Sixteenth Century Spaniard the almost superhuman being\nthat he was. Only Spain of the Sixteenth Century could have produced the\nConquistadors or such a man as St. Ignatius Loyola, whose learned,\ndevout, and fanatically militant Society of Jesus struck fear into the\nhearts of Protestant and Catholic Princes alike for the next two\ncenturies.\n\nThe regular reader of Astounding may remember that I gave another\nexample of the technique of truthful misdirection in \"The Best Policy,\"\n(July, 1957). An Earthman, captured by aliens, finds himself in a\nposition in which he is unable to tell even the smallest lie. But by\ntelling the absolute truth, he convinces the aliens that _homo sapiens_\nis a race of super-duper supermen. He does it so well that the aliens\nsurrender without attacking, even before the rest of humanity is aware\nof their existence.\n\nThe facts in \"Despoilers of the Golden Empire\" remain. They _are_ facts.\nFrancisco Pizarro and his men--an army of less than two\nhundred--actually _did_ inflict appalling damage on the Inca armies,\neven if they were outnumbered ten to one, and with astonishingly few\nlosses of their own. They did it with sheer guts, too; their equipment\nwas not too greatly superior to that of the Peruvians, and by the time\nthey reached the Great Inca himself, none of the Peruvians believed that\nthe invaders were demons or gods. But in the face of the Spaniards'\ndetermined onslaught, they were powerless.\n\nThe assassination scene at the end is almost an exact description of\nwhat happened. It _did_ take a dozen men in full armor to kill the\narmorless Pizarro, and even then it took trickery and treachery to do\nit.\n\nNow, just to show how fair I was--to show how I scrupulously refrained\nfrom lying--I will show what a sacrifice I made for the sake of truth.\n\nIf you'll recall, in the story, the dying Pizarro traces the Sign of the\nCross on the floor in his own blood, kisses it, and says \"_Jesus!_\"\nbefore he dies. This is in strict accord with every history on the\nsubject I could find.\n\nBut there is a legend to the effect that his last words were somewhat\ndifferent. I searched the New York Public Library for days trying to\nfind one single historian who would bear out the legend; I even went so\nfar as to get a librarian who could read Spanish and another whose\nGerman is somewhat better than mine to translate articles in foreign\nhistorical journals for me. All in vain. But if I _could_ have\nsubstantiated the legend, the final scene would have read something like\nthis:\n\n    Clawing at his sword-torn throat, the fearless old soldier brought\n    his hand away coated with the crimson of his own blood. Falling\n    forward, he traced the Sign of the Cross on the stone floor in\n    gleaming scarlet, kissed it, and then glared up at the men who\n    surrounded him, his eyes hard with anger and hate.\n\n    \"I'm going to Heaven,\" he said, his voice harsh and whispery. \"And\n    _you_, you _bastards_, can go to _Hell_!\"\n\nIt would have made one hell of an ending--but it had to be sacrificed in\nthe interests of Truth.\n\nSo I rest my case.\n\nI will even go further than that; I defy anyone to point out a single\nout-and-out lie in the whole story. G'wan--I _dare_ ya!\n\n(SECRET ASIDE TO THE READER; J. W. C., Jr., PLEASE DO _NOT_ READ!)\n\nAh, but wait! There _is_ a villain in the piece!\n\n_I_ did not lie to you, no. But you were lied to, all the same.\n\nBy whom?\n\nBy none less than that conniving arch-fiend, John W. Campbell, Jr.,\nthat's who!\n\nWasn't it he who bought the story?\n\nAnd wasn't it he who, with malice aforethought, published it in a\npackage which was plainly labeled Science Fiction?\n\nAnd, therefore, didn't you have every right to think it _was_ science\nfiction?\n\nSure you did!\n\nI am guilty of nothing more than weakness; my poor, frail sense of\nethics collapsed completely at the sight of the bribe he offered me to\nbecome a party to the dark conspiracy that sprang from the depths of his\nown demoniac mind. Ah, well; none of us is perfect, I suppose.\n\n                                                         DAVID GORDON.\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Astounding Science Fiction_ March\n    1959.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
