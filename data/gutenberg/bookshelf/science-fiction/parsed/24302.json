TREASON\n\n\nBy\n\nRANDALL GARRETT\n\n\nIllustrated by Gardner\n\n\n\n\n_The Prisoner_\n\n\nThe two rooms were not luxurious, but MacMaine hadn't expected that\nthey would be. The walls were a flat metallic gray, unadorned and\nwindowless. The ceilings and floors were simply continuations of the\nwalls, except for the glow-plates overhead. One room held a small\ncabinet for his personal possessions, a wide, reasonably soft bed, a\nsmall but adequate desk, and, in one corner, a cubicle that contained\nthe necessary sanitary plumbing facilities.\n\nThe other room held a couch, two big easy-chairs, a low table, some\nbookshelves, a squat refrigerator containing food and drink for his\noccasional snacks--his regular meals were brought in hot from the main\nkitchen--and a closet that contained his clothing--the insignialess\nuniforms of a Kerothi officer.\n\nNo, thought Sebastian MacMaine, it was not luxurious, but neither did\nit look like the prison cell it was.\n\nThere was comfort here, and even the illusion of privacy, although\nthere were TV pickups in the walls, placed so that no movement in\neither room would go unnoticed. The switch which cut off the soft white\nlight from the glow plates did not cut off the infrared radiation which\nenabled his hosts to watch him while he slept. Every sound was heard\nand recorded.\n\nBut none of that bothered MacMaine. On the contrary, he was glad of it.\nHe wanted the Kerothi to know that he had no intention of escaping or\nhatching any plot against them.\n\nHe had long since decided that, if things continued as they had, Earth\nwould lose the war with Keroth, and Sebastian MacMaine had no desire\nwhatever to be on the losing side of the greatest war ever fought. The\nproblem now was to convince the Kerothi that he fully intended to fight\nwith them, to give them the full benefit of his ability as a military\nstrategist, to do his best to win every battle for Keroth.\n\nAnd that was going to be the most difficult task of all.\n\nA telltale glow of red blinked rapidly over the door, and a soft chime\npinged in time with it.\n\nMacMaine smiled inwardly, although not a trace of it showed on his\nbroad-jawed, blocky face. To give him the illusion that he was a guest\nrather than a prisoner, the Kerothi had installed an announcer at the\ndoor and invariably used it. Not once had any one of them ever simply\nwalked in on him.\n\n\"Come in,\" MacMaine said.\n\nHe was seated in one of the easy-chairs in his \"living room,\" smoking a\ncigarette and reading a book on the history of Keroth, but he put the\nbook down on the low table as a tall Kerothi came in through the\ndoorway.\n\nMacMaine allowed himself a smile of honest pleasure. To most Earthmen,\n\"all the Carrot-skins look alike,\" and, MacMaine admitted honestly to\nhimself, he hadn't yet trained himself completely to look beyond the\nstrangenesses that made the Kerothi different from Earthmen and see the\ndetails that made them different from each other. But this was one\nKerothi that MacMaine would never mistake for any other.\n\n\"Tallis!\" He stood up and extended both hands in the Kerothi fashion.\nThe other did the same, and they clasped hands for a moment. \"How are\nyour guts?\" he added in Kerothic.\n\n\"They function smoothly, my sibling-by-choice,\" answered Space General\nPolan Tallis. \"And your own?\"\n\n\"Smoothly, indeed. It's been far too long a time since we have\ntouched.\"\n\nThe Kerothi stepped back a pace and looked the Earthman up and down.\n\"You look healthy enough--for a prisoner. You're treated well, then?\"\n\n\"Well enough. Sit down, my sibling-by-choice.\" MacMaine waved toward\nthe couch nearby. The general sat down and looked around the apartment.\n\n\"Well, well. You're getting preferential treatment, all right. This is\nas good as you could expect as a battleship commander. Maybe you're\nbeing trained for the job.\"\n\nMacMaine laughed, allowing the touch of sardonicism that he felt to be\nheard in the laughter. \"I might have hoped so once, Tallis. But I'm\nafraid I have simply come out even. I have traded nothing for nothing.\"\n\nGeneral Tallis reached into the pocket of his uniform jacket and took\nout the thin aluminum case that held the Kerothi equivalent of\ncigarettes. He took one out, put it between his lips, and lit it with\nthe hotpoint that was built into the case.\n\nMacMaine took an Earth cigarette out of the package on the table and\nallowed Tallis to light it for him. The pause and the silence, MacMaine\nknew, were for a purpose. He waited. Tallis had something to say, but\nhe was allowing the Earthman to \"adjust to surprise.\" It was one of the\nfine points of Kerothi etiquette.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nA sudden silence on the part of one participant in a conversation,\nunder these particular circumstances, meant that something unusual was\ncoming up, and the other person was supposed to take the opportunity to\nbrace himself for shock.\n\nIt could mean anything. In the Kerothi Space Forces, a superior\ninformed a junior officer of the junior's forthcoming promotion by just\nsuch tactics. But the same tactics were used when informing a person of\nthe death of a loved one.\n\nIn fact, MacMaine was well aware that such a period of silence was _de\nrigueur_ in a Kerothi court, just before sentence was pronounced, as\nwell as a preliminary to a proposal of marriage by a Kerothi male to\nthe _light of his love.\n\nMacMaine could do nothing but wait. It would be indelicate to speak\nuntil Tallis felt that he was ready for the surprise.\n\nIt was not, however, indelicate to watch Tallis' face closely; it was\nexpected. Theoretically, one was supposed to be able to discern, at\nleast, whether the news was good or bad.\n\nWith Tallis, it was impossible to tell, and MacMaine knew it would be\nuseless to read the man's expression. But he watched, nonetheless.\n\nIn one way, Tallis' face was typically Kerothi. The orange-pigmented\nskin and the bright, grass-green eyes were common to all Kerothi. The\nplanet Keroth, like Earth, had evolved several different \"races\" of\nhumanoid, but, unlike Earth, the distinction was not one of color.\n\nMacMaine took a drag off his cigarette and forced himself to keep his\nmind off whatever it was that Tallis might be about to say. He was\nalready prepared for a death sentence--even a death sentence by\ntorture. Now, he felt, he could not be shocked. And, rather than build\nup the tension within himself to an unbearable degree, he thought about\nTallis rather than about himself.\n\nTallis, like the rest of the Kerothi, was unbelievably humanoid. There\nwere internal differences in the placement of organs, and differences\nin the functions of those organs. For instance, it took two separate\norgans to perform the same function that the liver performed in\nEarthmen, and the kidneys were completely absent, that function being\nperformed by special tissues in the lower colon, which meant that the\nKerothi were more efficient with water-saving than Earthmen, since the\nwaste products were excreted as relatively dry solids through an\nall-purpose cloaca.\n\nBut, externally, a Kerothi would need only a touch of plastic surgery\nand some makeup to pass as an Earthman in a stage play. Close up, of\ncourse, the job would be much more difficult--as difficult as a Negro\ntrying to disguise himself as a Swede or _vice versa__.\n\nBut Tallis was--\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\n\"I would have a word,\" Tallis said, shattering MacMaine's carefully\nneutral train of thought. It was a standard opening for breaking the\npause of adjustment, but it presaged good news rather than bad.\n\n\"I await your word,\" MacMaine said. Even after all this time, he still\nfelt vaguely proud of his ability to handle the subtle idioms of\nKerothic.\n\n\"I think,\" Tallis said carefully, \"that you may be offered a commission\nin the Kerothi Space Forces.\"\n\nSebastian MacMaine let out his breath slowly, and only then realized\nthat he had been holding it. \"I am grateful, my sibling-by-choice,\" he\nsaid.\n\nGeneral Tallis tapped his cigarette ash into a large blue ceramic\nashtray. MacMaine could smell the acrid smoke from the alien plant\nmatter that burned in the Kerothi cigarette--a chopped-up inner bark\nfrom a Kerothi tree. MacMaine could no more smoke a Kerothi cigarette\nthan Tallis could smoke tobacco, but the two were remarkably similar in\ntheir effects.\n\nThe \"surprise\" had been delivered. Now, as was proper, Tallis would\nmove adroitly all around the subject until he was ready to return to it\nagain.\n\n\"You have been with us ... how long, Sepastian?\" he asked.\n\n\"Two and a third _Kronet_.\"\n\nTallis nodded. \"Nearly a year of your time.\"\n\nMacMaine smiled. Tallis was as proud of his knowledge of Earth\nterminology as MacMaine was proud of his mastery of Kerothic.\n\n\"Lacking three weeks,\" MacMaine said.\n\n\"What? Three ... oh, yes. Well. A long time,\" said Tallis.\n_\n\"The Board of Strategy asked me to tell you,\" Tallis continued. \"After\nall, my recommendation was partially responsible for the decision.\" He\npaused for a moment, but it was merely a conversational hesitation, not\na formal hiatus.\n\n\"It was a hard decision, Sepastian--you must realize that. We have been\nat war with your race for ten years now. We have taken thousands of\nEarthmen as prisoners, and many of them have agreed to co-operate with\nus. But, with one single exception, these prisoners have been the moral\ndregs of your civilization. They have been men who had no pride of\nrace, no pride of society, no pride of self. They have been weak,\nself-centered, small-minded, cowards who had no thought for Earth and\nEarthmen, but only for themselves.\n\n\"Not,\" he said hurriedly, \"that all of them are that way--or even the\nmajority. Most of them have the minds of warriors, although, I must\nsay, not _strong__ warriors.\"\n\nThat last, MacMaine knew, was a polite concession. The Kerothi had no\nrespect for Earthmen. And MacMaine could hardly blame them. For three\nlong centuries, the people of Earth had had nothing to do but indulge\nthemselves in the pleasures of material wealth. It was a wonder that\nany of them had any moral fiber left.\n\n\"But none of those who had any strength agreed to work with us,\" Tallis\nwent on. \"With one exception. You.\"\n\n\"Am I weak, then?\" MacMaine asked.\n\nGeneral Tallis shook his head in a peculiarly humanlike gesture. \"No.\nNo, you are not. And that is what has made us pause for three years.\"\nHis grass-green eyes looked candidly into MacMaine's own. \"You aren't\nthe type of person who betrays his own kind. It looks like a trap.\nAfter a whole year, the Board of Strategy still isn't sure that there\nis no trap.\"\n\nTallis stopped, leaned forward, and ground out the stub of his\ncigarette in the blue ashtray. Then his eyes again sought MacMaine's.\n\n\"If it were not for what I, personally, know about you, the Board of\nStrategy would not even consider your proposition.\"\n\n\"I take it, then, that they have considered it?\" MacMaine asked with a\ngrin.\n\n\"As I said, Sepastian,\" Tallis said, \"you have won your case. After\nalmost a year of your time, your decision has been justified.\"\n\nMacMaine lost his grin. \"I am grateful, Tallis,\" he said gravely. \"I\nthink you must realize that it was a difficult decision to make.\"\n\nHis thoughts went back, across long months of time and longer\nlight-years of space, to the day when that decision had been made.\n\n\n\n\n_The Decision__\n\n\nColonel Sebastian MacMaine didn't feel, that morning, as though this\nday were different from any other. The sun, faintly veiled by a few\nwisps of cloud, shone as it always had; the guards at the doors of the\nSpace Force Administration Building saluted him as usual; his brother\nofficers nodded politely, as they always did; his aide greeted him with\nthe usual \"Good morning, sir.\"\n\nThe duty list lay on his desk, as it had every morning for years.\nSebastian MacMaine felt tense and a little irritated with himself, but\nhe felt nothing that could be called a premonition.\n\nWhen he read the first item on the duty list, his irritation became a\nlittle stronger.\n\n\"_Interrogate Kerothi general.__\"\n\nThe interrogation duty had swung round to him again. He didn't want to\ntalk to General Tallis. There was something about the alien that\nbothered him, and he couldn't place exactly what it was.\n\nEarth had been lucky to capture the alien officer. In a space war,\nthere's usually very little left to capture after a battle--especially\nif your side lost the battle.\n\nOn the other hand, the Kerothi general wasn't so lucky. The food that\nhad been captured with him would run out in less than six months, and\nit was doubtful that he would survive on Earth food. It was equally\ndoubtful that any more Kerothi food would be captured.\n\nFor two years, Earth had been fighting the Kerothi, and for two years\nEarth had been winning a few minor skirmishes and losing the major\nbattles. The Kerothi hadn't hit any of the major colonies yet, but they\nhad swallowed up outpost after outpost, and Earth's space fleet was\nlosing ships faster than her factories could turn them out. The hell of\nit was that nobody on Earth seemed to be very much concerned about it\nat all.\n\nMacMaine wondered why he let it concern him. If no one else was\nworried, why did he let it bother him? He pushed the thought from his\nmind and picked up the questionnaire form that had been made out for\nthat morning's session with the Kerothi general. Might as well get it\nover with.\n\nHe glanced down the list of further duties for the day. It looked as\nthough the routine interrogation of the Kerothi general was likely to\nprovide most of the interest in the day's work at that.\n\nHe took the dropchute down to the basement of the building, to the\nsmall prison section where the alien officer was being held. The guards\nsaluted nonchalantly as he went in. The routine questioning sessions\nwere nothing new to them.\n\nMacMaine turned the lock on the prisoner's cell door and went in. Then\nhe came to attention and saluted the Kerothi general. He was probably\nthe only officer in the place who did that, he knew; the others treated\nthe alien general as though he were a criminal. Worse, they treated him\nas though he were a petty thief or a common pickpocket--criminal, yes,\nbut of a definitely inferior type.\n_\nGeneral Tallis, as always, stood and returned the salute. \"Cut mawnik,\nCunnel MacMaine,\" he said. The Kerothi language lacked many of the\nvoiced consonants of English and Russian, and, as a result, Tallis' use\nof _B__, _D__, _G__, _J__, _V__, and _Z__ made them come out as _P__,\n_T__, _K__, _CH__, _F__, and _S__. The English _R__, as it is\npronounced in _run__ or _rat__, eluded him entirely, and he pronounced\nit only when he could give it the guttural pronunciation of the German\n_R__. The terminal _NG__ always came out as _NK__. The nasal _M__ and\n_N_ were a little more drawn out than in English, but they were easily\nunderstandable.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\n\"Good morning, General Tallis,\" MacMaine said. \"Sit down. How do you\nfeel this morning?\"\n\nThe general sat again on the hard bunk that, aside from the single\nchair, was the only furniture in the small cell. \"Ass well ass coot pe\nexpectet. I ket ferry little exercisse. I ... how iss it set? ... I\npecome soft? Soft? Iss correct?\"\n\n\"Correct. You've learned our language very well for so short a time.\"\n\nThe general shrugged off the compliment. \"Wen it iss a matteh of learrn\nin orrter to surfife, one learrnss.\"\n\n\"You think, then, that your survival has depended on your learning our\nlanguage?\"\n\nThe general's orange face contrived a wry smile. \"Opfiously. Your\npeople fill not learn Kerothic. If I cannot answerr questionss, I am\nuff no use. Ass lonk ass I am uff use, I will liff. Not?\"\n\nMacMaine decided he might as well spring his bomb on the Kerothi\nofficer now as later. \"I am not so certain but that you might have\nstretched out your time longer if you had forced us to learn Kerothic,\ngeneral,\" he said in Kerothic. He knew his Kerothic was bad, since it\nhad been learned from the Kerothi spaceman who had been captured with\nthe general, and the man had been badly wounded and had survived only\ntwo weeks. But that little bit of basic instruction, plus the work he\nhad done on the books and tapes from the ruined Kerothi ship, had\nhelped him.\n_\n\"Ah?\" The general blinked in surprise. Then he smiled. \"Your accent,\"\nhe said in Kerothic, \"is atrocious, but certainly no worse than mine\nwhen I speak your _Inklitch_. I suppose you intend to question me in\nKerothic now, eh? In the hope that I may reveal more in my own tongue?\"\n\n\"Possibly you may,\" MacMaine said with a grin, \"but I learned it for my\nown information.\"\n\n\"For your own what? Oh. I see. Interesting. I know no others of your\nrace who would do such a thing. Anything which is difficult is beneath\nthem.\"\n\n\"Not so, general. I'm not unique. There are many of us who don't think\nthat way.\"\n\nThe general shrugged. \"I do not deny it. I merely say that I have met\nnone. Certainly they do not tend to go into military service. Possibly\nthat is because you are not a race of fighters. It takes a fighter to\ntackle the difficult just because it is difficult.\"\n\nMacMaine gave him a short, hard laugh. \"Don't you think getting\ninformation out of _you__ is difficult? And yet, we tackle that.\"\n\n\"Not the same thing at all. Routine. You have used no pressure. No\nthreats, no promises, no torture, no stress.\"\n\nMacMaine wasn't quite sure of his translation of the last two negative\nphrases. \"You mean the application of physical pain? That's barbaric.\"\n\n\"I won't pursue the subject,\" the general said with sudden irony.\n\n\"I can understand that. But you can rest assured that we would never do\nsuch a thing. It isn't civilized. Our civil police do use certain drugs\nto obtain information, but we have so little knowledge of Kerothi body\nchemistry that we hesitate to use drugs on you.\"\n\n\"The application of stress, you say, is not civilized. Not, perhaps,\naccording to your definition of\"--he used the English word--\"_cifiliced__.\nNo. Not _cifiliced_--but it works.\" Again he smiled. \"I said that I have\nbecome soft since I have been here, but I fear that your civilization\nis even softer.\"\n\n\"A man can lie, even if his arms are pulled off or his feet crushed,\"\nMacMaine said stiffly.\n\nThe Kerothi looked startled. When he spoke again, it was in English. \"I\nwill say no morr. If you haff questionss to ask, ko ahet. I will not\ntake up time with furtherr talkink.\"\n\nA little angry with himself and with the general, MacMaine spent the\nrest of the hour asking routine questions and getting nowhere, filling\nup the tape in his minicorder with the same old answers that others had\ngotten.\n\nHe left, giving the general a brisk salute and turning before the\ngeneral had time to return it.\n\nBack in his office, he filed the tape dutifully and started on Item Two\nof the duty list: _Strategy Analysis of Battle Reports_.\n\nStrategy analysis always irritated and upset him. He knew that if he'd\njust go about it in the approved way, there would be no\nirritation--only boredom. But he was constitutionally incapable of\nworking that way. In spite of himself, he always played a little game\nwith himself and with the General Strategy Computer.\n\nThe only battle of significance in the past week had been the defense\nof an Earth outpost called Bennington IV. Theoretically, MacMaine was\nsupposed to check over the entire report, find out where the losing\nside had erred, and feed correctional information into the Computer.\nBut he couldn't resist stopping after he had read the first section:\n_Information Known to Earth Commander at Moment of Initial Contact_.\n\nThen he would stop and consider how he, personally, would have handled\nthe situation if he had been the Earth commander. So many ships in\nsuch-and-such places. Enemy fleet approaching at such-and-such\nvelocities. Battle array of enemy thus-and-so.\n\nNow what?\n\nMacMaine thought over the information on the defense of Bennington IV\nand devised a battle plan. There was a weak point in the enemy's\nattack, but it was rather obvious. MacMaine searched until he found\nanother weak point, much less obvious than the first. He knew it would\nbe there. It was.\n\nThen he proceeded to ignore both weak points and concentrate on what he\nwould do if he were the enemy commander. The weak points were traps;\nthe computer could see them and avoid them. Which was just exactly what\nwas wrong with the computer's logic. In avoiding the traps, it also\navoided the best way to hit the enemy. A weak point _is_ weak, no\nmatter how well it may be booby-trapped. In baiting a rat trap, you\nhave to use real cheese because an imitation won't work.\n\n_Of course_, MacMaine thought to himself, _you can always poison the\ncheese, but let's not carry the analogy too far._\n\nAll right, then. How to hit the traps?\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nIt took him half an hour to devise a completely wacky and unorthodox\nway of hitting the holes in the enemy advance. He checked the time\ncarefully, because there's no point in devising a strategy if the\nbattle is too far gone to use it by the time you've figured it out.\n\nThen he went ahead and read the rest of the report. Earth had lost the\noutpost. And, worse, MacMaine's strategy would have won the battle if\nit had been used. He fed it through his small office computer to make\nsure. The odds were good.\n\nAnd that was the thing that made MacMaine hate Strategy Analysis. Too\noften, he won; too often, Earth lost. A computer was fine for working\nout the logical outcome of a battle if it was given the proper\nstrategy, but it couldn't devise anything new.\n\nColonel MacMaine had tried to get himself transferred to space duty,\nbut without success. The Commanding Staff didn't want him out there.\n\nThe trouble was that they didn't believe MacMaine actually devised his\nstrategy before he read the complete report. How could anyone out-think\na computer?\n\nHe'd offered to prove it. \"Give me a problem,\" he'd told his immediate\nsuperior, General Matsukuo. \"Give me the Initial Contact information of\na battle I haven't seen before, and I'll show you.\"\n\nAnd Matsukuo had said, testily: \"Colonel, I will not permit a member of\nmy staff to make a fool of himself in front of the Commanding Staff.\nSetting yourself up as someone superior to the Strategy Board is the\nmost antisocial type of egocentrism imaginable. You were given the same\neducation at the Academy as every other officer; what makes you think\nyou are better than they? As time goes on, your automatic promotions\nwill put you in a position to vote on such matters--provided you don't\nprejudice the Promotion Board against you by antisocial behavior. I\nhold you in the highest regard, colonel, and I will say nothing to the\nPromotion Board about this, but if you persist I will have to do my\nduty. Now, I don't want to hear any more about it. Is that clear?\"\n\nIt was.\n\nAll MacMaine had to do was wait, and he'd automatically be promoted to\nthe Commanding Staff, where he would have an equal vote with the others\nof his rank. One unit vote to begin with and an additional unit for\nevery year thereafter.\n\n_It's a great system for running a peacetime social club, maybe_,\nMacMaine thought, _but it's no way to run a fighting force_.\n\nMaybe the Kerothi general was right. Maybe _homo sapiens_ just wasn't\na race of fighters.\n\nThey had been once. Mankind had fought its way to domination of Earth\nby battling every other form of life on the planet, from the smallest\nvirus to the biggest carnivore. The fight against disease was still\ngoing on, as a matter of fact, and Man was still fighting the elemental\nfury of Earth's climate.\n\nBut Man no longer fought with Man. Was that a bad thing? The discovery\nof atomic energy, two centuries before, had literally made war\nimpossible, if the race was to survive. Small struggles bred bigger\nstruggles--or so the reasoning went. Therefore, the society had\nunconsciously sought to eliminate the reasons for struggle.\n\nWhat bred the hatreds and jealousies among men? What caused one group\nto fight another?\n\nSociety had decided that intolerance and hatred were caused by\ninequality. The jealousy of the inferior toward his superior; the scorn\nof the superior toward his inferior. The Have-not envies the Have, and\nthe Have looks down upon the Have-not.\n\nThen let us eliminate the Have-not. Let us make sure that everyone is a\nHave.\n\nRaise the standard of living. Make sure that every human being has the\nnecessities of life--food, clothing, shelter, proper medical care, and\nproper education. More, give them the luxuries, too--let no man be\nwithout anything that is poorer in quality or less in quantity than the\npossessions of any other. There was no longer any middle class simply\nbecause there were no other classes for it to be in the middle of.\n\n\"The poor you will have always with you,\" Jesus of Nazareth had said.\nBut, in a material sense, that was no longer true. The poor were\ngone--and so were the rich.\n\nBut the poor in mind and the poor in spirit were still there--in\never-increasing numbers.\n\nMaterial wealth could be evenly distributed, but it could not remain\nthat way unless Society made sure that the man who was more clever than\nthe rest could not increase his wealth at the expense of his less\nfortunate brethren.\n\nMake it a social stigma to show more ability than the average. Be kind\nto your fellow man; don't show him up as a stupid clod, no matter how\ncloddish he may be.\n\n_All men are created equal, and let's make sure they stay that way!_\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nThere could be no such thing as a classless society, of course. That\nwas easily seen. No human being could do everything, learn everything,\nbe everything. There had to be doctors and lawyers and policemen and\nbartenders and soldiers and machinists and laborers and actors and\nwriters and criminals and bums.\n\nBut let's make sure that the differentiation between classes is\nhorizontal, not vertical. As long as a person does his job the best he\ncan, he's as good as anybody else. A doctor is as good as a lawyer,\nisn't he? Then a garbage collector is just as good as a nuclear\nphysicist, and an astronomer is no better than a street sweeper.\n\nAnd what of the loafer, the bum, the man who's too lazy or weak-willed\nto put out any more effort than is absolutely necessary to stay alive?\nWell, my goodness, the poor chap can't _help_ it, can he? It isn't\n_his_ fault, is it? He has to be helped. There is always _something_ he\nis both capable of doing and willing to do. Does he like to sit around\nall day and do nothing but watch television? Then give him a sheet of\npaper with all the programs on it and two little boxes marked _Yes_ and\n_No_, and he can put an X in one or the other to indicate whether he\nlikes the program or not. Useful? Certainly. All these sheets can be\ntallied up in order to find out what sort of program the public likes\nto see. After all, his vote is just as good as anyone else's, isn't it?\n\nAnd a Program Analyst is just as good, just as important, and just as\nwell cared-for as anyone else.\n\nAnd what about the criminal? Well, what _is_ a criminal? A person who\nthinks he's superior to others. A thief steals because he thinks he has\nmore right to something than its real owner. A man kills because he has\nan idea that he has a better right to live than someone else. In short,\na man breaks the law because he feels superior, because he thinks he\ncan outsmart Society and The Law. Or, simply, because he thinks he can\noutsmart the policeman on the beat.\n\nObviously, that sort of antisocial behavior can't be allowed. The poor\nfellow who thinks he's better than anyone else has to be segregated\nfrom normal society and treated for his aberrations. But not punished!\nHeavens no! His erratic behavior isn't _his_ fault, is it?\n\nIt was axiomatic that there had to be some sort of vertical structure\nto society, naturally. A child can't do the work of an adult, and a\nbeginner can't be as good as an old hand. Aside from the fact that it\nwas actually impossible to force everyone into a common mold, it was\nrecognized that there had to be some incentive for staying with a job.\nWhat to do?\n\nThe labor unions had solved that problem two hundred years before.\nPromotion by seniority. Stick with a job long enough, and you'll\nautomatically rise to the top. That way, everyone had as good a chance\nas everyone else.\n\nPromotion tables for individual jobs were worked out on the basis of\nlongevity tables, so that by the time a man reached the automatic\nretirement age he was automatically at the highest position he could\nhold. No fuss, no bother, no trouble. Just keep your nose clean and\nlive as long as possible.\n\nIt eliminated struggle. It eliminated the petty jockeying for position\nthat undermined efficiency in an organization. Everybody deserves an\nequal chance in life, so make sure everybody gets it.\n\nColonel Sebastian MacMaine had been born and reared in that society. He\ncould see many of its faults, but he didn't have the orientation to see\nall of them. As he'd grown older, he'd seen that, regardless of the\nposition a man held according to seniority, a smart man could exercise\nmore power than those above him if he did it carefully.\n\nA man is a slave if he is held rigidly in a pattern and not permitted\nto step out of that pattern. In ancient times, a slave was born at the\nbottom of the social ladder, and he remained there all his life. Only\nrarely did a slave of exceptional merit manage to rise above his\nassigned position.\n\nBut a man who is forced to remain on the bottom step of a stationary\nstairway is no more a slave than a man who is forced to remain on a\ngiven step of an escalator, and no less so.\n\nSlavery, however, has two advantages--one for the individual, and one\nwhich, in the long run, can be good for the race. For the individual,\nit offers security, and that is the goal which by far the greater\nmajority of mankind seeks.\n\nThe second advantage is more difficult to see. It operates only in\nfavor of the exceptional individual. There are always individuals who\naspire to greater heights than the one they occupy at any given moment,\nbut in a slave society, they are slapped back into place if they act\nhastily. Just as the one-eyed man in the kingdom of the blind can be\nking if he taps the ground with a cane, so the gifted individual can\ngain his ends in a slave society--provided he thinks out the\nconsequences of any act in advance.\n\nThe Law of Gravity is a universal edict which enslaves, in a sense,\nevery particle of matter in the cosmos. The man who attempts to defy\nthe \"injustice\" of that law by ignoring the consequences of its\nenforcement will find himself punished rather severely. It may be\nunjust that a bird can fly under its own muscle power, but a man who\ntries to correct that injustice by leaping out of a skyscraper window\nand flapping his arms vigorously will find that overt defiance of the\nLaw of Gravity brings very serious penalties indeed. The wise man seeks\nthe loopholes in the law, and loopholes are caused by other laws which\ncounteract--_not defy!_--the given law. A balloon full of hydrogen\n\"falls up\" in obedience to the Law of Gravity. A contradiction? A\nparadox? No. It is the Law of Gravity which causes the density and\npressure of a planet's atmosphere to decrease with altitude, and that\ndecrease in pressure forces the balloon upwards until the balance point\nbetween atmospheric density and the internal density of the balloon is\nreached.\n\nThe illustration may seem obvious and elementary to the modern man, but\nit seems so only because he understands, at least to some extent, the\nlaws involved. It was not obvious to even the most learned man of, say,\nthe Thirteenth Century.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nSlavery, too, has its laws, and it is as dangerous to defy the laws of\na society as it is to defy those of nature, and the only way to escape\nthe punishment resulting from those laws is to find the loopholes. One\nof the most basic laws of any society is so basic that it is never,\n_ever_ written down.\n\nAnd that law, like all basic laws, is so simple in expression and so\nobvious in application that any man above the moron level has an\nintuitive grasp of it. It is the first law one learns as a child.\n\n_Thou shall not suffer thyself to be caught._\n\nThe unthinking man believes that this basic law can be applied by\nbreaking the laws of his society in secret. What he fails to see is\nthat such lawbreaking requires such a fantastic network of lies,\nsubterfuges, evasions, and chicanery that the structure itself\neventually breaks down and his guilt is obvious to all. The very steps\nhe has taken to keep from getting caught eventually become signposts\nthat point unerringly at the lawbreaker himself.\n\nLike the loopholes in the law of gravity, the loopholes in the laws of\nsociety can not entail a _defiance_ of the law. Only compliance with\nthose laws will be ultimately successful.\n\nThe wise man works within the framework of the law--not only the\nwritten, but the unwritten law--of his society. In a slave society, any\nslave who openly rebels will find that he gets squashed pretty quickly.\nBut many a slave-owner has danced willingly to the tune of a slave who\nwas wiser and cleverer than he, without ever knowing that the tune\nplayed was not his own.\n\nAnd that is the second advantage of slavery. It teaches the exceptional\nindividual to think.\n\nWhen a wise, intelligent individual openly and violently breaks the\nlaws of his society, there are two things which are almost certain:\nOne: he knows that there is no other way to do the thing he feels must\nbe done, and--\n\nTwo: he knows that he will pay the penalty for his crime in one way or\nanother.\n\nSebastian MacMaine knew the operations of those laws. As a member of a\nself-enslaved society, he knew that to betray any sign of intelligence\nwas dangerous. A slight slip could bring the scorn of the slaves around\nhim; a major offense could mean death. The war with Keroth had thrown\nhim slightly off balance, but after his one experience with General\nMatsukuo, he had quickly regained his equilibrium.\n\nAt the end of his work day, MacMaine closed his desk and left his\noffice precisely on time, as usual. Working overtime, except in the\ngravest emergencies, was looked upon as antisocialism. The offender was\nsuspected of having Ambition--obviously a Bad Thing.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nIt was during his meal at the Officers' Mess that Colonel Sebastian\nMacMaine heard the statement that triggered the decision in his mind.\n\nThere were three other officers seated with MacMaine around one of the\nfour-place tables in the big room. MacMaine only paid enough attention\nto the table conversation to be able to make the appropriate noises at\nthe proper times. He had long since learned to do his thinking under\ncover of general banalities.\n\nColonel VanDeusen was a man who would never have made Private First\nClass in an army that operated on a strict merit system. His thinking\nwas muddy, and his conversation betrayed it. All he felt comfortable in\ntalking about was just exactly what he had been taught. Slogans,\nbanalities, and bromides. He knew his catechism, and he knew it was\nsafe.\n\n\"What I mean is, we got nothing to worry about. We all stick together,\nand we can do anything. As long as we don't rock the boat, we'll come\nthrough O.K.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said Major Brock, looking up from his plate in blank-faced\nsurprise. \"I mean, who says different?\"\n\n\"Guy on my research team,\" said VanDeusen, plying his fork\nindustriously. \"A wise-guy second looie. One of them.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said the major knowingly. \"One of them.\" He went back to his\nmeal.\n\n\"What'd he say?\" MacMaine asked, just to keep his oar in.\n\n\"Ahhh, nothing serious, I guess,\" said VanDeusen, around a mouthful of\nsteak. \"Said we were all clogged up with paper work, makin' reports on\ntests, things like that. Said, why don't we figure out something to pop\nthose Carrot-skins outa the sky. So I said to him, 'Look, Lootenant,' I\nsaid, 'you got your job to do, I got mine. If the paper work's pilin'\nup,' I said, 'it's because somebody isn't pulling his share. And it\nbetter not be you,' I said.\" He chuckled and speared another cube of\nsteak with his fork. \"That settled him down. He's all right, though.\nYoung yet, you know. Soon's he gets the hang of how the Space Force\noperates, he'll be O.K.\"\n\nSince VanDeusen was the senior officer at the table, the others\nlistened respectfully as he talked, only inserting a word now and then\nto show that they were listening.\n\nMacMaine was thinking deeply about something else entirely, but\nVanDeusen's influence intruded a little. MacMaine was wondering what it\nwas that bothered him about General Tallis, the Kerothi prisoner.\n\nThe alien was pleasant enough, in spite of his position. He seemed to\naccept his imprisonment as one of the fortunes of war. He didn't\nthreaten or bluster, although he tended to maintain an air of\nsuperiority that would have been unbearable in an Earthman.\n\nWas that the reason for his uneasiness in the general's presence? No.\nMacMaine could accept the reason for that attitude; the general's\nbackground was different from that of an Earthman, and therefore he\ncould not be judged by Terrestrial standards. Besides, MacMaine could\nacknowledge to himself that Tallis was superior to the norm--not only\nthe norm of Keroth, but that of Earth. MacMaine wasn't sure he could\nhave acknowledged superiority in another Earthman, in spite of the fact\nthat he knew that there must be men who were his superiors in one way\nor another.\n\nBecause of his social background, he knew that he would probably form\nan intense and instant dislike for any Earthman who talked the way\nTallis did, but he found that he actually _liked_ the alien officer.\n\nIt came as a slight shock when the realization hit MacMaine that his\nliking for the general was exactly why he was uncomfortable around him.\nDammit, a man isn't supposed to like his enemy--and most especially\nwhen that enemy does and says things that one would despise in a\nfriend.\n\nCome to think of it, though, did he, MacMaine, actually have any\nfriends? He looked around him, suddenly clearly conscious of the other\nmen in the room. He searched through his memory, thinking of all his\nacquaintances and relatives.\n\nIt was an even greater shock to realize that he would not be more than\nfaintly touched emotionally if any or all of them were to die at that\ninstant. Even his parents, both of whom were now dead, were only dim\nfigures in his memory. He had mourned them when an aircraft accident\nhad taken both of them when he was only eleven, but he found himself\nwondering if it had been the loss of loved ones that had caused his\nemotional upset or simply the abrupt vanishing of a kind of security he\nhad taken for granted.\n\nAnd yet, he felt that the death of General Polan Tallis would leave an\nempty place in his life.\n\nColonel VanDeusen was still holding forth.\n\n\"... So I told him. I said, 'Look, Lootenant,' I said, 'don't rock the\nboat. You're a kid yet, you know,' I said. 'You got equal rights with\neverybody else,' I said, 'but if you rock the boat, you aren't gonna\nget along so well.'\n\n\"'You just behave yourself,' I said, 'and pull your share of the load\nand do your job right and keep your nose clean, and you'll come out all\nright.\n\n\"'Time I get to be on the General Staff,' I told him, 'why, you'll be\ntakin' over my job, maybe. That's the way it works,' I said.\n\n\"He's a good kid. I mean, he's a fresh young punk, that's all. He'll\nlearn, O.K. He'll climb right up, once he's got the right attitude.\nWhy, when I was----\"\n\nBut MacMaine was no longer listening. It was astonishing to realize\nthat what VanDeusen had said was perfectly true. A blockhead like\nVanDeusen would simply be lifted to a position of higher authority,\nonly to be replaced by another blockhead. There would be no essential\nchange in the _status quo_.\n\nThe Kerothi were winning steadily, and the people of Earth and her\ncolonies were making no changes whatever in their way of living. The\nmajority of people were too blind to be able to see what was happening,\nand the rest were afraid to admit the danger, even to themselves. It\nrequired no great understanding of strategy to see what the inevitable\noutcome must be.\n\nAt some point in the last few centuries, human civilization had taken\nthe wrong path--a path that led only to oblivion.\n\nIt was at that moment that Colonel Sebastian MacMaine made his\ndecision.\n\n\n\n\n_The Escape_\n\n\n\"Are you sure you understand, Tallis?\" MacMaine asked in Kerothic.\n\nThe alien general nodded emphatically. \"Perfectly. Your Kerothic is not\nso bad that I could misunderstand your instructions. I still don't\nunderstand why you are doing this. Oh I know the reasons you've given\nme, but I don't completely believe them. However, I'll go along with\nyou. The worst that could happen would be for me to be killed, and I\nwould sooner face death in trying to escape than in waiting for your\nexecutioners. If this is some sort of trap, some sort of weird way your\nrace's twisted idea of kindness has evolved to dispose of me, then I'll\naccept your sentence. It's better than starving to death or facing a\nfiring squad.\"\n\n\"Not a firing squad,\" MacMaine said. \"That wouldn't be kind. An\nodorless, but quite deadly gas would be pumped into this cell while you\nslept.\"\n\n\"That's worse. When death comes, I want to face it and fight it off as\nlong as possible, not have it sneaking up on me in my sleep. I think\nI'd rather starve.\"\n\n\"You would,\" said MacMaine. \"The food that was captured with you has\nnearly run out, and we haven't been able to capture any more. But\nrather than let you suffer, they would have killed you painlessly.\" He\nglanced at the watch on his instrument cuff. \"Almost time.\"\n\nMacMaine looked the alien over once more. Tallis was dressed in the\nuniform of Earth's Space Force, and the insignia of a full general\ngleamed on his collar. His face and hands had been sprayed with an\nopaque, pink-tan film, and his hairless head was covered with a black\nwig. He wouldn't pass a close inspection, but MacMaine fervently hoped\nthat he wouldn't need to.\n\n_Think it out, be sure you're right, then go ahead._ Sebastian MacMaine\nhad done just that. For three months, he had worked over the details of\nhis plan, making sure that they were as perfect as he was capable of\nmaking them. Even so, there was a great deal of risk involved, and\nthere were too many details that required luck for MacMaine to be\nperfectly happy about the plan.\n\nBut time was running out. As the general's food supply dwindled, his\nexecution date neared, and now it was only two days away. There was no\npoint in waiting until the last minute; it was now or never.\n\nThere were no spying TV cameras in the general's cell, no hidden\nmicrophones to report and record what went on. No one had ever escaped\nfrom the Space Force's prison, therefore, no one ever would.\n\nMacMaine glanced again at his watch. It was time. He reached inside his\nblouse and took out a fully loaded handgun.\n\nFor an instant, the alien officer's eyes widened, and he stiffened as\nif he were ready to die in an attempt to disarm the Earthman. Then he\nsaw that MacMaine wasn't holding it by the butt; his hand was clasped\naround the middle of the weapon.\n\n\"This is a chance I have to take,\" MacMaine said evenly. \"With this\ngun, you can shoot me down right here and try to escape alone. I've\ntold you every detail of our course of action, and, with luck, you\nmight make it alone.\" He held out his hand, with the weapon resting on\nhis open palm.\n\nGeneral Tallis eyed the Earthman for a long second. Then, without\nhaste, he took the gun and inspected it with a professional eye.\n\n\"Do you know how to operate it?\" MacMaine asked, forcing calmness into\nhis voice.\n\n\"Yes. We've captured plenty of them.\" Tallis thumbed the stud that\nallowed the magazine to slide out of the butt and into his hand. Then\nhe checked the mechanism and the power cartridges. Finally, he replaced\nthe magazine and put the weapon into the empty sleeve holster that\nMacMaine had given him.\n\nMacMaine let his breath out slowly. \"All right,\" he said. \"Let's go.\"\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nHe opened the door of the cell, and both men stepped out into the\ncorridor. At the far end of the corridor, some thirty yards away, stood\nthe two armed guards who kept watch over the prisoner. At that\ndistance, it was impossible to tell that Tallis was not what he\nappeared to be.\n\nThe guard had been changed while MacMaine was in the prisoner's cell,\nand he was relying on the lax discipline of the soldiers to get him and\nTallis out of the cell block. With luck, the guards would have failed\nto listen too closely to what they had been told by the men they\nreplaced; with even greater luck, the previous guardsmen would have\nfailed to be too explicit about who was in the prisoner's cell. With no\nluck at all, MacMaine would be forced to shoot to kill.\n\nMacMaine walked casually up to the two men, who came to an easy\nattention.\n\n\"I want you two men to come with me. Something odd has happened, and\nGeneral Quinby and I want two witnesses as to what went on.\"\n\n\"What happened, sir?\" one of them asked.\n\n\"Don't know for sure,\" MacMaine said in a puzzled voice. \"The general\nand I were talking to the prisoner, when all of a sudden he fell over.\nI think he's dead. I couldn't find a heartbeat. I want you to take a\nlook at him so that you can testify that we didn't shoot him or\nanything.\"\n\nObediently, the two guards headed for the cell, and MacMaine fell in\nbehind them. \"You couldn't of shot him, sir,\" said the second guard\nconfidently. \"We would of heard the shot.\"\n\n\"Besides,\" said the other, \"it don't matter much. He was going to be\ngassed day after tomorrow.\"\n\nAs the trio approached the cell, Tallis pulled the door open a little\nwider and, in doing so, contrived to put himself behind it so that his\nface couldn't be seen. The young guards weren't too awed by a full\ngeneral; after all, they'd be generals themselves someday. They were\nmuch more interested in seeing the dead alien.\n\nAs the guards reached the cell door, MacMaine unholstered his pistol\nfrom his sleeve and brought it down hard on the head of the nearest\nyouth. At the same time, Tallis stepped from behind the door and\nclouted the other.\n\nQuickly, MacMaine disarmed the fallen men and dragged them into the\nopen cell. He came out again and locked the door securely. Their guns\nwere tossed into an empty cell nearby.\n\n\"They won't be missed until the next change of watch, in four hours,\"\nMacMaine said. \"By then, it won't matter, one way or another.\"\n\nGetting out of the huge building that housed the administrative offices\nof the Space Force was relatively easy. A lift chute brought the pair\nto the main floor, and, this late in the evening, there weren't many\npeople on that floor. The officers and men who had night duty were\nworking on the upper floors. Several times, Tallis had to take a\nhandkerchief from his pocket and pretend to blow his nose in order to\nconceal his alien features from someone who came too close, but no one\nappeared to notice anything out of the ordinary.\n\nAs they walked out boldly through the main door, fifteen minutes later,\nthe guards merely came to attention and relaxed as a tall colonel and a\nsomewhat shorter general strode out. The general appeared to be having\na fit of sneezing, and the colonel was heard to say: \"That's quite a\ncold you've picked up, sir. Better get over to the dispensary and take\nan anti-coryza shot.\"\n\n\"Mmmf,\" said the general. \"_Ha-CHOO!_\"\n\nGetting to the spaceport was no problem at all. MacMaine had an\nofficial car waiting, and the two sergeants in the front seat didn't\npay any attention to the general getting in the back seat because\nColonel MacMaine was talking to them. \"We're ready to roll, sergeant,\"\nhe said to the driver. \"General Quinby wants to go straight to the\n_Manila_, so let's get there as fast as possible. Take-off is scheduled\nin ten minutes.\" Then he got into the back seat himself. The one-way\nglass partition that separated the back seat from the front prevented\neither of the two men from looking back at their passengers.\n\nSeven minutes later, the staff car was rolling unquestioned through the\nmain gate of Waikiki Spaceport.\n\nIt was all so incredibly easy, MacMaine thought. Nobody questioned an\nofficial car. Nobody checked anything too closely. Nobody wanted to\nrisk his lifelong security by doing or saying something that might be\nconsidered antisocial by a busy general. Besides, it never entered\nanyone's mind that there could be anything wrong. If there was a war\non, apparently no one had been told about it yet.\n\nMacMaine thought, _Was I ever that stubbornly blind? Not quite, I\nguess, or I'd never have seen what is happening_. But he knew he hadn't\nbeen too much more perceptive than those around him. Even to an\nintelligent man, the mask of stupidity can become a barrier to the\noutside world as well as a concealment from it.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nThe Interstellar Ship _Manila_ was a small, fast, ten-man blaster-boat,\ndesigned to get in to the thick of a battle quickly, strike hard, and\nget away. Unlike the bigger, more powerful battle cruisers, she could\nbe landed directly on any planet with less than a two-gee pull at the\nsurface. The really big babies had to be parked in an orbit and loaded\nby shuttle; they'd break up of their own weight if they tried to set\ndown on anything bigger than a good-sized planetoid. As long as their\nantiacceleration fields were on, they could take unimaginable thrusts\nalong their axes, but the A-A fields were the cause of those thrusts as\nwell as the protection against them. The ships couldn't stand still\nwhile they were operating, so they were no protection at all against a\nplanet's gravity. But a blaster-boat was small enough and compact\nenough to take the strain.\n\nIt had taken careful preparation to get the _Manila_ ready to go just\nexactly when MacMaine needed it. Papers had to be forged and put into\nthe chain of command communication at precisely the right times; others\nhad had to be taken out and replaced with harmless near-duplicates so\nthat the Commanding Staff wouldn't discover the deception. He had had\nto build up the fictional identity of a \"General Lucius Quinby\" in such\na way that it would take a thorough check to discover that the officer\nwho had been put in command of the _Manila_ was nonexistent.\n\nIt was two minutes until take-off time when the staff car pulled up at\nthe foot of the ramp that led up to the main air lock of the ISS\n_Manila_. A young-looking captain was standing nervously at the foot of\nit, obviously afraid that his new commander might be late for the\ntake-off and wondering what sort of decision he would have to make if\nthe general wasn't there at take-off time. MacMaine could imagine his\nfeelings.\n\n\"General Quinby\" developed another sneezing fit as he stepped out of\nthe car. This was the touchiest part of MacMaine's plan, the weakest\nlink in the whole chain of action. For a space of perhaps a minute, the\ndisguised Kerothi general would have to stand so close to the young\ncaptain that the crudity of his makeup job would be detectable. He had\nto keep that handkerchief over his face, and yet do it in such a way\nthat it would seem natural.\n\nAs Tallis climbed out of the car, chuffing windily into the kerchief,\nMacMaine snapped an order to the sergeant behind the wheel. \"That's\nall. We're taking off almost immediately, so get that car out of here.\"\n\nThen he walked rapidly over to the captain, who had snapped to\nattention. There was a definite look of relief on his face, now that he\nknew his commander was on time.\n\n\"All ready for take-off, captain? Everything checked out? Ammunition?\nEnergy packs all filled to capacity? All the crew aboard? Full rations\nand stores stowed away?\"\n\nThe captain kept his eyes on MacMaine's face as he answered \"Yes, sir;\nyes, sir; yes, sir,\" to the rapid fire of questions. He had no time to\nshift his gaze to the face of his new C.O., who was snuffling his way\ntoward the foot of the landing ramp. MacMaine kept firing questions\nuntil Tallis was halfway up the ramp.\n\nThen he said: \"Oh, by the way, captain--was the large package\ncontaining General Quinby's personal gear brought aboard?\"\n\n\"The big package? Yes, sir. About fifteen minutes ago.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said MacMaine. He looked up the ramp. \"Are there any special\norders at this time, sir?\" he asked.\n\n\"No,\" said Tallis, without turning. \"Carry on, colonel.\" He went on up\nto the air lock. It had taken Tallis hours of practice to say that\nphrase properly, but the training had been worth it.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nAfter Tallis was well inside the air lock, MacMaine whispered to the\nyoung captain, \"As you can see, the general has got a rather bad cold.\nHe'll want to remain in his cabin until he's over it. See that\nanti-coryza shots are sent up from the dispensary as soon as we are out\nof the Solar System. Now, let's go; we have less than a minute till\ntake-off.\"\n\nMacMaine went up the ramp with the captain scrambling up behind him.\n\nTallis was just stepping into the commander's cabin as the two men\nentered the air lock. MacMaine didn't see him again until the ship was\ntwelve minutes on her way--nearly five billion miles from Earth and\nstill accelerating.\n\nHe identified himself at the door and Tallis opened it cautiously.\n\n\"I brought your anti-coryza shot, sir,\" he said. In a small ship like\nthe _Manila_, the captain and the seven crew members could hear any\nconversation in the companionways. He stepped inside and closed the\ndoor. Then he practically collapsed on the nearest chair and had a good\ncase of the shakes.\n\n\"So-so f-f-far, s-so good,\" he said.\n\nGeneral Tallis grasped his shoulder with a firm hand. \"Brace up,\nSepastian,\" he said gently in Kerothic. \"You've done a beautiful job. I\nstill can't believe it, but I'll have to admit that if this is an act\nit's a beautiful one.\" He gestured toward the small desk in one corner\nof the room and the big package that was sitting on it. \"The food is\nall there. I'll have to eat sparingly, but I can make it. Now, what's\nthe rest of the plan?\"\n\nMacMaine took a deep breath, held it, and let it out slowly. His shakes\nsubsided to a faint, almost imperceptible quiver. \"The captain doesn't\nknow our destination. He was told that he would receive secret\ninstructions from you.\" His voice, he noticed thankfully, was almost\nnormal. He reached into his uniform jacket and took out an\nofficial-looking sealed envelope. \"These are the orders. We are going\nout to arrange a special truce with the Kerothi.\"\n\n\"_What?_\"\n\n\"That's what it says here. You'll have to get on the subradio and do\nsome plain and fancy talking. Fortunately, not a man jack aboard this\nship knows a word of your language, so they'll think you're arranging\ntruce terms.\n\n\"They'll be sitting ducks when your warship pulls up alongside and\nsends in a boarding party. By the time they realize what has happened,\nit will be too late.\"\n\n\"You're giving us the ship, too?\" Tallis looked at him wonderingly.\n\"And eight prisoners?\"\n\n\"Nine,\" said MacMaine. \"I'll hand over my sidearm to you just before\nyour men come through the air lock.\"\n\nGeneral Tallis sat down in the other small chair, his eyes still on the\nEarthman. \"I can't help but feel that this is some sort of trick, but\nif it is, I can't see through it. Why are you doing this, Sepastian?\"\n\n\"You may not understand this, Tallis,\" MacMaine said evenly, \"but I am\nfighting for freedom. The freedom to think.\"\n\n\n\n\n_The Traitor_\n\n\nConvincing the Kerothi that he was in earnest was more difficult than\nMacMaine had at first supposed. He had done his best, and now, after\nnearly a year of captivity, Tallis had come to tell him that his offer\nhad been accepted.\n\nGeneral Tallis sat across from Colonel MacMaine, smoking his cigarette\nabsently.\n\n\"Just why are they accepting my proposition?\" MacMaine asked bluntly.\n\n\"Because they can afford to,\" Tallis said with a smile. \"You will be\nwatched, my sibling-by-choice. Watched every moment, for any sign of\ntreason. Your flagship will be a small ten-man blaster-boat--one of our\nown. You gave us one; we'll give you one. At the worst, we will come\nout even. At the best, your admittedly brilliant grasp of tactics and\nstrategy will enable us to save thousands of Kerothi lives, to say\nnothing of the immense savings in time and money.\"\n\n\"All I ask is a chance to prove my ability and my loyalty.\"\n\n\"You've already proven your ability. All of the strategy problems that\nyou have been given over the past year were actual battles that had\nalready been fought. In eighty-seven per cent of the cases, your\nstrategy proved to be superior to our own. In most of the others, it\nwas just as good. In only three cases was the estimate of your losses\nhigher than the actual losses. Actually, we'd be fools to turn you\ndown. We have everything to gain and nothing to lose.\"\n\n\"I felt the same way a year ago,\" said MacMaine. \"Even being watched\nall the time will allow me more freedom than I had on Earth--if the\nBoard of Strategy is willing to meet my terms.\"\n\nTallis chuckled. \"They are. You'll be the best-paid officer in the\nentire fleet; none of the rest of us gets a tenth of what you'll be\ngetting, as far as personal value is concerned. And yet, it costs us\npractically nothing. You drive an attractive bargain, Sepastian.\"\n\n\"Is that the kind of pay you'd like to get, Tallis?\" MacMaine asked\nwith a smile.\n\n\"Why not? You'll get your terms: full pay as a Kerothi general, with\nretirement on full pay after the war is over. The pick of the most\nbeautiful--by your standards--of the Earthwomen we capture. A home on\nKeroth, built to your specifications, and full citizenship, including\nthe freedom to enter into any business relationships you wish. If you\nkeep your promises, we can keep ours and still come out ahead.\"\n\n\"Good. When do we start?\"\n\n\"Now,\" said Tallis rising from his chair. \"Put on your dress uniform,\nand we'll go down to see the High Commander. We've got to give you a\nset of general's insignia, my sibling-by-choice.\"\n\nTallis waited while MacMaine donned the blue trousers and gold-trimmed\nred uniform of a Kerothi officer. When he was through, MacMaine looked\nat himself in the mirror. \"There's one more thing, Tallis,\" he said\nthoughtfully.\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"This hair. I think you'd better arrange to have it permanently\nremoved, according to your custom. I can't do anything about the color\nof my skin, but there's no point in my looking like one of your wild\nhillmen.\"\n\n\"You're very gracious,\" Tallis said. \"And very wise. Our officers will\ncertainly come closer to feeling that you are one of us.\"\n\n\"I am one of you from this moment,\" MacMaine said. \"I never intend to\nsee Earth again, except, perhaps, from space--when we fight the final\nbattle of the war.\"\n\n\"That may be a hard battle,\" Tallis said.\n\n\"Maybe,\" MacMaine said thoughtfully. \"On the other hand, if my overall\nstrategy comes out the way I think it will, that battle may never be\nfought at all. I think that complete and total surrender will end the\nwar before we ever get that close to Earth.\"\n\n\"I hope you're right,\" Tallis said firmly. \"This war is costing far\nmore than we had anticipated, in spite of the weakness of your--that\nis, of Earth.\"\n\n\"Well,\" MacMaine said with a slight grin, \"at least you've been able to\ncapture enough Earth food to keep me eating well all this time.\"\n\nTallis' grin was broad. \"You're right. We're not doing too badly at\nthat. Now, let's go; the High Commander is waiting.\"\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nMacMaine didn't realize until he walked into the big room that what he\nwas facing was not just a discussion with a high officer, but what\namounted to a Court of Inquiry.\n\nThe High Commander, a dome-headed, wrinkled, yellow-skinned, hard-eyed\nold Kerothi, was seated in the center of a long, high desk, flanked on\neither side by two lower-ranking generals who had the same deadly, hard\nlook. Off to one side, almost like a jury in a jury box, sat twenty or\nso lesser officers, none of them ranking below the Kerothi equivalent\nof lieutenant-colonel.\n\nAs far as MacMaine could tell, none of the officers wore the insignia\nof fleet officers, the spaceship-and-comet that showed that the wearer\nwas a fighting man. These were the men of the Permanent Headquarters\nStaff--the military group that controlled, not only the armed forces of\nKeroth, but the civil government as well.\n\n\"What's this?\" MacMaine hissed in a whispered aside, in English.\n\n\"Pearr up, my prrotherr,\" Tallis answered softly, in the same tongue,\n\"all is well.\"\n\nMacMaine had known, long before he had ever heard of General Polan\nTallis, that the Hegemony of Keroth was governed by a military junta,\nand that all Kerothi were regarded as members of the armed forces.\nTechnically, there were no civilians; they were legally members of the\n\"unorganized reserve,\" and were under military law. He had known that\nKerothi society was, in its own way, as much a slave society as that of\nEarth, but it had the advantage over Earth in that the system did allow\nfor advance by merit. If a man had the determination to get ahead, and\nthe ability to cut the throat--either literally or figuratively--of the\nman above him in rank, he could take his place.\n\nOn a more strictly legal basis, it was possible for a common trooper to\nbecome an officer by going through the schools set up for that purpose,\nbut, in practice, it took both pull and pressure to get into those\nschools.\n\nIn theory, any citizen of the Hegemony could become an officer, and any\nofficer could become a member of the Permanent Headquarters Staff.\nActually, a much greater preference was given to the children of\nofficers. Examinations were given periodically for the purpose of\nrecruiting new members for the elite officers' corps, and any citizen\ncould take the examination--once.\n\nBut the tests were heavily weighted in favor of those who were already\nwell-versed in matters military, including what might be called the\n\"inside jokes\" of the officers' corps. A common trooper had some chance\nof passing the examination; a civilian had a very minute chance. A\nnoncommissioned officer had the best chance of passing the examination,\nbut there were age limits which usually kept NCO's from getting a\ncommission. By the time a man became a noncommissioned officer, he was\ntoo old to be admitted to the officers training schools. There were\nallowances made for \"extraordinary merit,\" which allowed common\ntroopers or upper-grade NCO's to be commissioned in spite of the\ngeneral rules, and an astute man could take advantage of those\nallowances.\n\nAbility could get a man up the ladder, but it had to be a particular\nkind of ability.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nDuring his sojourn as a \"guest\" of the Kerothi, MacMaine had made a\npoint of exploring the history of the race. He knew perfectly well that\nthe histories he had read were doctored, twisted, and, in general,\ntotally unreliable in so far as presenting anything that would be\ncalled a history by an unbiased investigator.\n\nBut, knowing this, MacMaine had been able to learn a great deal about\nthe present society. Even if the \"history\" was worthless as such, it\ndid tell something about the attitudes of a society that would make up\nsuch a history. And, too, he felt that, in general, the main events\nwhich had been catalogued actually occurred; the details had been\nblurred, and the attitudes of the people had been misrepresented, but\nthe skeleton was essentially factual.\n\nMacMaine felt that he knew what kind of philosophy had produced the\nmental attitudes of the Court he now faced, and he felt he knew how to\nhandle himself before them.\n\nHalf a dozen paces in front of the great desk, the color of the floor\ntiling was different from that of the rest of the floor. Instead of a\nsolid blue, it was a dead black. Tallis, who was slightly ahead of\nMacMaine, came to a halt as his toes touched the edge of the black\narea.\n\n_Uh-oh! a balk line_, MacMaine thought. He stopped sharply at the same\npoint. Both of them just stood there for a full minute while they were\ncarefully inspected by the members of the Court.\n\nThen the High Commander gestured with one hand, and the officer to his\nleft leaned forward and said: \"Why is this one brought before us in the\nuniform of an officer, bare of any insignia of rank?\"\n\nIt could only be a ritual question, MacMaine decided; they must know\nwhy he was there.\n\n\"I bring him as a candidate for admission to our Ingroup,\" Tallis\nreplied formally, \"and ask the indulgence of Your Superiorities\ntherefor.\"\n\n\"And who are you who ask our indulgence?\"\n\nTallis identified himself at length--name, rank, serial number,\nmilitary record, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.\n\nBy the time he had finished, MacMaine was beginning to think that the\nrecitation would go on forever. The High Commander had closed his eyes,\nand he looked as if he had gone to sleep.\n\nThere was more formality. Through it all, MacMaine stood at rigid\nattention, flexing his calf muscles occasionally to keep the blood\nflowing in his legs. He had no desire to disgrace himself by passing\nout in front of the Court.\n\nFinally the Kerothi officer stopped asking Tallis questions and looked\nat the High Commander. MacMaine got the feeling that there was about to\nbe a departure from the usual procedure.\n\nWithout opening his eyes, the High Commander said, in a brittle, rather\nharsh voice, \"These circumstances are unprecedented.\" Then he opened\nhis eyes and looked directly at MacMaine. \"Never has an animal been\nproposed for such an honor. In times past, such a proposal would have\nbeen mockery of this Court and this Ingroup, and a crime of such\nmonstrous proportions as to merit Excommunication.\"\n\nMacMaine knew what that meant. The word was used literally; the\ncondemned one was cut off from all communication by having his sensory\nnerves surgically severed. Madness followed quickly; psychosomatic\ndeath followed eventually, as the brain, cut off from any outside\nstimuli except those which could not be eliminated without death\nfollowing instantly, finally became incapable of keeping the body\nalive. Without feedback, control was impossible, and the\norganism-as-a-whole slowly deteriorated until death was inevitable.\n\nAt first, the victim screamed and thrashed his limbs as the brain sent\nout message after message to the rest of the body, but since the brain\nhad no way of knowing whether the messages had been received or acted\nupon, the victim soon went into a state comparable to that of catatonia\nand finally died.\n\nIf it was not the ultimate in punishment, it was a damned close\napproach, MacMaine thought. And he felt that the word \"damned\" could\nbe used in that sense without fear of exaggeration.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\n\"However,\" the High Commander went on, gazing at the ceiling,\n\"circumstances change. It would once have been thought vile that a\nmachine should be allowed to do the work of a skilled man, and the\nthought that a machine might do the work with more precision and\ngreater rapidity would have been almost blasphemous.\n\n\"This case must be viewed in the same light. As we are replacing\ncertain of our workers on our outer planets with Earth animals simply\nbecause they are capable of doing the work more cheaply, so we must\nrecognize that the same interests of economy govern in this case.\n\n\"A computing animal, in that sense, is in the same class as a computing\nmachine. It would be folly to waste their abilities simply because they\nare not human.\n\n\"There also arises the question of command. It has been represented to\nthis court, by certain officers who have been active in investigating\nthe candidate animal, that it would be as degrading to ask a human\nofficer to take orders from an animal as it would be to ask him to take\norders from a commoner of the Unorganized Reserve, if not more so. And,\nI must admit, there is, on the surface of it, some basis for this\nreasoning.\n\n\"But, again, we must not let ourselves be misled. Does not a spaceship\npilot, in a sense, take orders from the computer that gives him his\norbits and courses? In fact, do not all computers give orders, in one\nway or another, to those who use them?\n\n\"Why, then, should we refuse to take orders from a computing animal?\"\n\nHe paused and appeared to listen to the silence in the room before\ngoing on.\n\n\"Stand at ease until the High Commander looks at you again,\" Tallis\nsaid in a low aside.\n\nThis was definitely the pause for adjusting to surprise.\n\nIt seemed interminable, though it couldn't have been longer than a\nminute later that the High Commander dropped his gaze from the ceiling\nto MacMaine. When MacMaine snapped to attention again, the others in\nthe room became suddenly silent.\n\n\"We feel,\" the hard-faced old Kerothi continued, as if there had been\nno break, \"that, in this case, we are justified in employing the animal\nin question.\n\n\"However, we must make certain exceptions to our normal procedure. The\ncandidate is not a machine, and therefore cannot be treated as a\nmachine. Neither is it human, and therefore cannot be treated as human.\n\n\"Therefore, this is the judgment of the Court of the Ingroup:\n\n\"The animal, having shown itself to be capable of behaving, in some\ndegree, as befits an officer--including, as we have been informed,\nvoluntarily conforming to our custom as regards superfluous hair--it\nshall henceforth be considered as having the same status as an untaught\nchild or a barbarian, insofar as social conventions are concerned, and\nshall be entitled to the use of the human pronoun, he.\n\n\"Further, he shall be entitled to wear the uniform he now wears, and\nthe insignia of a General of the Fleet. He shall be entitled, as far as\npersonal contact goes, to the privileges of that rank, and shall be\naddressed as such.\n\n\"He will be accorded the right of punishment of an officer of that\nrank, insofar as disciplining his inferiors is concerned, except that\nhe must first secure the concurrence of his Guardian Officer, as\nhereinafter provided.\n\n\"He shall also be subject to punishment in the same way and for the\nsame offenses as humans of his rank, taking into account physiological\ndifferences, except as hereinafter provided.\n\n\"His reward for proper service\"--The High Commander listed the demands\nMacMaine had made--\"are deemed fitting, and shall be paid, provided his\nduties in service are carried out as proposed.\n\n\"Obviously, however, certain restrictions must be made. General\nMacMaine, as he is entitled to be called, is employed solely as a\nStrategy Computer. His ability as such and his knowledge of the\npsychology of the Earth animals are, as far as we are concerned at this\nmoment, his only useful attributes. Therefore, his command is\nrestricted to that function. He is empowered to act only through the\nother officers of the Fleet as this Court may appoint; he is not to\ncommand directly.\n\n\"Further, it is ordered that he shall have a Guardian Officer, who\nshall accompany him at all times and shall be directly responsible for\nhis actions.\n\n\"That officer shall be punished for any deliberate crime committed by\nthe aforesaid General MacMaine as if he had himself committed the\ncrime.\n\n\"Until such time as this Court may appoint another officer for the\npurpose, General Polan Tallis, previously identified in these\nproceedings, is appointed as Guardian Officer.\"\n\nThe High Commander paused for a moment, then he said: \"Proceed with the\ninvestment of the insignia.\"\n\n\n\n\n_The Strategy_\n\n\nGeneral Sebastian MacMaine, sometime Colonel of Earth's Space Force,\nand presently a General of the Kerothi Fleet, looked at the array of\nstars that appeared to drift by the main viewplate of his flagship, the\nblaster-boat _Shudos_.\n\nBehind him, General Tallis was saying, \"You've done well, Sepastian.\nBetter than anyone could have really expected. Three battles so far,\nand every one of them won by a margin far greater than anticipated. Any\nideas that anyone may have had that you were not wholly working for the\nKerothi cause has certainly been dispelled.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Tallis.\" MacMaine turned to look at the Kerothi officer. \"I\nonly hope that I can keep it up. Now that we're ready for the big push,\nI can't help but wonder what would happen if I were to lose a battle.\"\n\n\"Frankly,\" Tallis said, \"that would depend on several things, the main\none being whether or not it appeared that you had deliberately thrown\nthe advantage to the enemy. But nobody expects you, or anyone else, to\nwin every time. Even the most brilliant commander can make an honest\nmistake, and if it can be shown that it _was_ an honest mistake, and\none, furthermore, that he could not have been expected to avoid, he\nwouldn't be punished for it. In your case, I'll admit that the\ninvestigation would be a great deal more thorough than normal, and that\nyou wouldn't get as much of the benefit of the doubt as another officer\nmight, but unless there is a deliberate error I doubt that anything\nserious would happen.\"\n\n\"Do you really believe that, Tallis, or is it just wishful thinking on\nyour part, knowing as you do that your punishment will be the same as\nmine if I fail?\" MacMaine asked flatly.\n\nTallis didn't hesitate. \"If I didn't believe it, I would ask to be\nrelieved as your Guardian. And the moment I did that, you would be\nremoved from command. The moment I feel that you are not acting for the\nbest interests of Keroth, I will act--not only to protect myself, but\nto protect my people.\"\n\n\"That's fair enough,\" MacMaine said. \"But how about the others?\"\n\n\"I cannot speak for my fellow officers--only for myself.\" Then Tallis'\nvoice became cold. \"Just keep your hands clean, Sepastian, and all will\nbe well. You will not be punished for mistakes--only for crimes. If you\nare planning no crimes, this worry of yours is needless.\"\n\n\"I ceased to worry about myself long ago,\" MacMaine said coolly. \"I do\nnot fear personal death, not even by Excommunication. My sole worry is\nabout the ultimate outcome of the war if I should fail. That, and\nnothing more.\"\n\n\"I believe you,\" Tallis said. \"Let us say no more about it. Your\nactions are difficult for us to understand, in some ways, that's all.\nNo Kerothi would ever change his allegiance as you have. Nor has any\nEarth officer that we have captured shown any desire to do so. Oh, some\nof them have agreed to do almost anything we wanted them to, but these\nwere not the intelligent ones, and even they were only doing it to save\ntheir own miserable hides.\n\n\"Still, you are an exceptional man, Sepastian, unlike any other of your\nrace, as far as we know. Perhaps it is simply that you are the only one\nwith enough wisdom to seek your intellectual equals rather than remain\nloyal to a mass of stupid animals who are fit only to be slaves.\"\n\n\"It was because I foresaw their eventual enslavement that I acted as I\ndid,\" MacMaine admitted. \"As I saw it, I had only two choices--to\nremain as I was and become a slave to the Kerothi or to put myself in\nyour hands willingly and hope for the best. As you----\"\n\nHe was interrupted by a harsh voice from a nearby speaker.\n\n\"_Battle stations! Battle stations! Enemy fleet in detector range!\nContact in twelve minutes!_\"\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nTallis and MacMaine headed for the Command Room at a fast trot. The\nthree other Kerothi who made up the Strategy Staff came in at almost\nthe same time. There was a flurry of activity as the computers and\nviewers were readied for action, then the Kerothi looked expectantly at\nthe Earthman.\n\nMacMaine looked at the detector screens. The deployment of the\napproaching Earth fleet was almost as he had expected it would be.\nThere were slight differences, but they would require only minor\nchanges in the strategy he had mapped out from the information brought\nin by the Kerothi scout ships.\n\nUndoubtedly, the Kerothi position had been relayed to the Earth\ncommander by their own advance scouts buzzing about in tiny, one-man\nshells just small enough to be undetectable at normal range.\n\nWatching the positions on the screens carefully, MacMaine called out a\nseries of numbers in an unhurried voice and watched as the orders,\nrelayed by the Kerothi staff, changed the position of parts of the\nKerothi fleet. Then, as the computer-led Earth fleet jockeyed to\ncompensate for the change in the Kerothi deployment, MacMaine called\nout more orders.\n\nThe High Commander of Keroth had called MacMaine a \"computing animal,\"\nbut the term was far from accurate. MacMaine couldn't possibly have\ncomputed all the variables in that battle, and he didn't try. It was a\nmatter of human intuition against mechanical logic. The advantage lay\nwith MacMaine, for, while the computer could not logically fathom the\nintuitive processes of its human opponent, MacMaine could and did have\nan intuitive grasp of the machine's logic. MacMaine didn't need to know\nevery variable in the pattern; he only needed to know the pattern as a\nwhole.\n\nThe _Shudos_ was well in the rear of the main body of the Kerothi\nfleet. There was every necessity for keeping MacMaine's flagship out of\nas much of the fighting as possible.\n\nWhen the first contact was made, MacMaine was certain of the outcome.\nHis voice became a steady drone as he called out instructions to the\nstaff officers; his mind was so fully occupied with the moving pattern\nbefore him that he noticed nothing else in the room around him.\n\nSpaceship against spaceship, the two fleets locked in battle. The\nwarheads of ultralight torpedoes flared their eye-searing explosions\nsoundlessly into the void; ships exploded like overcharged beer bottles\nas blaster energy caught them and smashed through their screens; men\nand machines flamed and died, scattering the stripped nuclei of their\ncomponent atoms through the screaming silence of space.\n\nAnd through it all, Sebastian MacMaine watched dispassionately, calling\nout his orders as ten Earthmen died for every Kerothi death.\n\nThis was a crucial battle. The big push toward the center of Earth's\ncluster of worlds had begun. Until now, the Kerothi had been fighting\nthe outposts, the planets on the fringes of Earth's sphere of influence\nwhich were only lightly colonized, and therefore relatively easy to\ntake. Earth's strongest fleets were out there, to protect planets that\ncould not protect themselves.\n\nInside that periphery were the more densely populated planets, the\nself-sufficient colonies which were more or less able to defend\nthemselves without too much reliance on space fleets as such. But now\nthat the backbone of the Earth's Space Force had been all but broken,\nit would be a relatively easy matter to mop up planet after planet,\nsince each one could be surrounded separately, pounded into surrender,\nand secured before going on to the next. That, at least, had been the\noriginal Kerothi intention. But MacMaine had told them that there was\nanother way--a way which, if it succeeded, would save time, lives, and\nmoney for the Kerothi. And, if it failed, MacMaine said, they would be\nno worse off, they would simply have to resume the original plan.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nNow, the first of the big colony planets was to be taken. When the\nprotecting Earth fleet was reduced to tatters, the Kerothi would go on\nto Houston's World as the first step in the big push toward Earth\nitself.\n\nBut MacMaine wasn't thinking of that phase of the war. That was still\nin the future, while the hellish space battle was still at hand.\n\nHe lost track of time as he watched the Kerothi fleet take advantage of\ntheir superior tactical position and tear the Earth fleet to bits. Not\nuntil he saw the remains of the Earth fleet turn tail and run did he\nrealize that the battle had been won.\n\nThe Kerothi fleet consolidated itself. There was no point in pursuing\nthe fleeting Earth ships; that would only break up the solidity of the\nKerothi deployment. The losers could afford to scatter; the winners\ncould not. Early in the war, the Kerothi had used that trick against\nEarth; the Kerothi had broken and fled, and the Earth fleet had split\nup to chase them down. The scattered Earth ships had suddenly found\nthat they had been led into traps composed of hidden clusters of\nKerothi ships. Naturally, the trick had never worked again for either\nside.\n\n\"All right,\" MacMaine said when it was all over, \"let's get on to\nHouston's World.\"\n\nThe staff men, including Tallis, were already on their feet,\ncongratulating MacMaine and shaking his hands. Even General Hokotan,\nthe Headquarters Staff man, who had been transferred temporarily to the\nFleet Force to keep an eye on both MacMaine and Tallis, was\nenthusiastically pounding MacMaine's shoulder.\n\nNo one aboard was supposed to know that Hokotan was a Headquarters\nofficer, but MacMaine had spotted the spy rather easily. There was a\ndifference between the fighters of the Fleet and the politicoes of\nHeadquarters. The politicoes were no harder, perhaps, nor more\nruthless, than the fighters, but they were of a different breed. Theirs\nwas the ruthlessness of the bully who steps on those who are weaker\nrather than the ruthlessness of the man who kills only to win a battle.\nMacMaine had the feeling that the Headquarters Staff preferred to spend\ntheir time browbeating their underlings rather than risk their necks\nwith someone who could fight back, however weakly.\n\nGeneral Hokotan seemed to have more of the fighting quality than most\nHQ men, but he wasn't a Fleet Officer at heart. He couldn't be compared\nto Tallis without looking small and mean.\n\nAs a matter of cold fact, very few of the officers were in anyway\ncomparable to Tallis--not even the Fleet men. The more MacMaine learned\nof the Kerothi, the more he realized just how lucky he had been that it\nhad been Tallis, and not some other Kerothi general, who had been\ncaptured by the Earth forces. He was not at all sure that his plan\nwould have worked at all with any of the other officers he had met.\n\nTallis, like MacMaine, was an unusual specimen of his race.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nMacMaine took the congratulations of the Kerothi officers with a look\nof pleasure on his face, and when they had subsided somewhat, he\ngrinned and said:\n\n\"Let's get a little work done around here, shall we? We have a planet\nto reduce yet.\"\n\nThey laughed. Reducing a planet didn't require strategy--only\nfire-power. The planet-based defenses couldn't maneuver, but the energy\nreserve of a planet is greater than that of any fleet, no matter how\nlarge. Each defense point would have to be cut down individually by the\nmassed power of the fleet, cut down one by one until the planet was\nhelpless. The planet as a whole might have more energy reserve than the\nfleet, but no individual defense point did. The problem was to avoid\nbeing hit by the rest of the defense points while one single point was\nbearing the brunt of the fleet's attack. It wasn't without danger, but\nit could be done.\n\nAnd for a job like that, MacMaine's special abilities weren't needed.\nHe could only watch and wait until it was over.\n\nSo he watched and waited. Unlike the short-time fury of a space battle,\nthe reduction of a planet took days of steady pounding. When it was\nover, the blaster-boats of the Kerothi fleet and the shuttles from the\ngreat battle cruisers landed on Houston's World and took possession of\nthe planet.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nMacMaine was waiting in his cabin when General Hokotan brought the news\nthat the planet was secured.\n\n\"They are ours,\" the HQ spy said with a superior smile. \"The sniveling\nanimals didn't even seem to want to defend themselves. They don't even\nknow how to fight a hand-to-hand battle. How could such things have\never evolved intelligence enough to conquer space?\" Hokotan enjoyed\nmaking such remarks to MacMaine's face, knowing that since MacMaine was\ntechnically a Kerothi he couldn't show any emotion when the enemy was\ninsulted.\n\nMacMaine showed none. \"Got them all, eh?\" he said.\n\n\"All but a few who scattered into the hills and forests. But not many\nof them had the guts to leave the security of their cities, even though\nwe were occupying them.\"\n\n\"How many are left alive?\"\n\n\"An estimated hundred and fifty million, more or less.\"\n\n\"Good. That should be enough to set an example. I picked Houston's\nWorld because we can withdraw from it without weakening our position;\nits position in space is such that it would constitute no menace to us\neven if we never reduced it. That way, we can be sure that our little\nmessage is received on Earth.\"\n\nHokotan's grin was wolfish. \"And the whole weak-hearted race will shake\nwith fear, eh?\"\n\n\"Exactly. Tallis can speak English well enough to be understood. Have\nhim make the announcement to them. He can word it however he likes, but\nthe essence is to be this: Houston's World resisted the occupation by\nKerothi troops; an example must be made of them to show them what\nhappens to Earthmen who resist.\"\n\n\"That's all?\"\n\n\"That's enough. Oh, by the way, make sure that there are plenty of\ntheir cargo spaceships in good working order; I doubt that we've ruined\nthem all, but if we have, repair some of them.\n\n\"And, too, you'd better make sure that you allow some of the merchant\nspacemen to 'escape,' just in case there are no space pilots among\nthose who took to the hills. We want to make sure that someone can use\nthose ships to take the news back to Earth.\"\n\n\"And the rest?\" Hokotan asked, with an expectant look. He knew what was\nto be done, but he wanted to hear MacMaine say it again.\n\nMacMaine obliged.\n\n\"Hang them. Every man, every woman, every child. I want them to be\ndecorating every lamppost and roof-beam on the planet, dangling like\noverripe fruit when the Earth forces return.\"\n\n\n\n\n_The Results_\n\n\n\"I don't understand it,\" said General Polan Tallis worriedly. \"Where\nare they coming from? How are they doing it? What's happened?\"\n\nMacMaine and the four Kerothi officers were sitting in the small dining\nroom that doubled as a recreation room between meals. The nervous\nstrain of the past few months was beginning to tell on all of them.\n\n\"Six months ago,\" Tallis continued jerkily, \"we had them beaten. One\nplanet after another was reduced in turn. Then, out of nowhere, comes a\nfleet of ships we didn't even know existed, and they've smashed us at\nevery turn.\"\n\n\"If they _are_ ships,\" said Loopat, the youngest officer of the\n_Shudos_ staff. \"Who ever heard of a battleship that was undetectable\nat a distance of less than half a million miles? It's impossible!\"\n\n\"Then we're being torn to pieces by the impossible!\" Hokotan snapped.\n\"Before we even know they are anywhere around, they are blasting us\nwith everything they've got! Not even the strategic genius of General\nMacMaine can help us if we have no time to plot strategy!\"\n\nThe Kerothi had been avoiding MacMaine's eyes, but now, at the mention\nof his name, they all looked at him as if their collective gaze had\nbeen drawn to him by some unknown attractive force.\n\n\"It's like fighting ghosts,\" MacMaine said in a hushed voice. For the\nfirst time, he felt a feeling of awe that was almost akin to fear. What\nhad he done?\n\nIn another sense, that same question was in the mind of the Kerothi.\n\n\"Have you any notion at all what they are doing or how they are doing\nit?\" asked Tallis gently.\n\n\"None,\" MacMaine answered truthfully. \"None at all, I swear to you.\"\n\n\"They don't even behave like Earthmen,\" said the fourth Kerothi, a\nthick-necked officer named Ossif. \"They not only outfight us, they\noutthink us at every turn. Is it possible, General MacMaine, that the\nEarthmen have allies of another race, a race of intelligent beings that\nwe don't know of?\" He left unsaid the added implication: \"_And that\nyou have neglected to tell us about?_\"\n\n\"Again,\" said MacMaine, \"I swear to you that I know nothing of any\nthird intelligent race in the galaxy.\"\n\n\"If there were such allies,\" Tallis said, \"isn't it odd that they\nshould wait so long to aid their friends?\"\n\n\"No odder than that the Earthmen should suddenly develop superweapons\nthat we cannot understand, much less fight against,\" Hokotan said, with\na touch of anger.\n\n\"Not 'superweapons',\" MacMaine corrected almost absently. \"All they\nhave is a method of making their biggest ships indetectable until\nthey're so close that it doesn't matter. When they do register on our\ndetectors, it's too late. But the weapons they strike with are the same\ntype as they've always used, I believe.\"\n\n\"All right, then,\" Hokotan said, his voice showing more anger. \"One\nweapon or whatever you want to call it. Practical invisibility. But\nthat's enough. An invisible man with a knife is more deadly than a\ndozen ordinary men with modern armament. Are you sure you know nothing\nof this, General MacMaine?\"\n\nBefore MacMaine could answer, Tallis said, \"Don't be ridiculous,\nHokotan! If he had known that such a weapon existed, would he have been\nfool enough to leave his people? With that secret, they stand a good\nchance of beating us in less than half the time it took us to wipe out\ntheir fleet--or, rather, to wipe out as much of it as we did.\"\n\n\"They got a new fleet somewhere,\" said young Loopat, almost to himself.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nTallis ignored him. \"If MacMaine deserted his former allegiance,\nknowing that they had a method of rendering the action of a space drive\nindetectable, then he was and is a blithering idiot. And we know he\nisn't.\"\n\n\"All right, all right! I concede that,\" snapped Hokotan. \"He knows\nnothing. I don't say that I fully trust him, even now, but I'll admit\nthat I cannot see how he is to blame for the reversals of the past few\nmonths.\n\n\"If the Earthmen had somehow been informed of our activities, or if we\nhad invented a superweapon and they found out about it, I would be\ninclined to put the blame squarely on MacMaine. But----\"\n\n\"How would he get such information out?\" Tallis cut in sharply. \"He has\nbeen watched every minute of every day. We know he couldn't send any\ninformation to Earth. How could he?\"\n\n\"Telepathy, for all I know!\" Hokotan retorted. \"But that's beside the\npoint! I don't trust him any farther than I can see him, and not\ncompletely, even then. But I concede that there is no possible\nconnection between this new menace and anything MacMaine might have\ndone.\n\n\"This is no time to worry about that sort of thing; we've got to find\nsome way of getting our hands on one of those ghost ships!\"\n\n\"I do suggest,\" put in the thick-necked Ossif, \"that we keep a closer\nwatch on General MacMaine. Now that the Earth animals are making a\ncomeback, he might decide to turn his coat now, even if he has been\ninnocent of any acts against Keroth so far.\"\n\nHokotan's laugh was a short, hard bark. \"Oh, we'll watch him, all\nright, Ossif. But, as Tallis has pointed out, MacMaine is not a fool,\nand he would certainly be a fool to return to Earth if his leaving it\nwas a genuine act of desertion. The last planet we captured, before\nthis invisibility thing came up to stop us, was plastered all over with\nnotices that the Earth fleet was concentrating on the capture of the\narch-traitor MacMaine.\n\n\"The price on his head, as a corpse, is enough to allow an Earthman to\nretire in luxury for life. The man who brings him back alive gets ten\ntimes that amount.\n\n\"Of course, it's possible that the whole thing is a put-up job--a smoke\nscreen for our benefit. That's why we must and will keep a closer\nwatch. But only a few of the Earth's higher-up would know that it was a\nsmoke screen; the rest believe it, whether it is true or not. MacMaine\nwould have to be very careful not to let the wrong people get their\nhands on him if he returned.\"\n\n\"It's no smoke screen,\" MacMaine said in a matter-of-fact tone. \"I\nassure you that I have no intention of returning to Earth. If Keroth\nloses this war, then I will die--either fighting for the Kerothi or by\nexecution at the hands of Earthmen if I am captured. Or,\" he added\nmusingly, \"perhaps even at the hands of the Kerothi, if someone decides\nthat a scapegoat is needed to atone for the loss of the war.\"\n\n\"If you are guilty of treason,\" Hokotan barked, \"you will die as a\ntraitor! If you are not, there is no need for your death. The Kerothi\ndo not need scapegoats!\"\n\n\"Talk, talk, talk!\" Tallis said with a sudden bellow. \"We have agreed\nthat MacMaine has done nothing that could even remotely be regarded as\nsuspicious! He has fought hard and loyally; he has been more ruthless\nthan any of us in destroying the enemy. Very well, we will guard him\nmore closely. We can put him in irons if that's necessary.\n\n\"But let's quit yapping and start thinking! We've been acting like\nfrightened children, not knowing what it is we fear, and venting our\nfear-caused anger on the most handy target!\n\n\"Let's act like men--not like children!\"\n\nAfter a moment, Hokotan said: \"I agree.\" His voice was firm, but calm.\n\"Our job will be to get our hands on one of those new Earth ships.\nAnyone have any suggestions?\"\n\nThey had all kinds of suggestions, one after another. The detectors,\nhowever, worked because they detected the distortion of space which was\nas necessary for the drive of a ship as the distortion of air was\nnecessary for the movement of a propeller-driven aircraft. None of them\ncould see how a ship could avoid making that distortion, and none of\nthem could figure out how to go about capturing a ship that no one\ncould even detect until it was too late to set a trap.\n\nThe discussion went on for days. And it was continued the next day and\nthe next. And the days dragged out into weeks.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nCommunications with Keroth broke down. The Fleet-to-Headquarters\ncourier ships, small in size, without armament, and practically solidly\npacked with drive mechanism, could presumably outrun anything but\nanother unarmed courier. An armed ship of the same size would have to\nuse some of the space for her weapons, which meant that the drive would\nhave to be smaller; if the drive remained the same size, then the\narmament would make the ship larger. In either case, the speed would be\ncut down. A smaller ship might outrun a standard courier, but if they\ngot much smaller, there wouldn't be room inside for the pilot.\n\nNonetheless, courier after courier never arrived at its destination.\n\nAnd the Kerothi Fleet was being decimated by the hit-and-run tactics of\nthe Earth's ghost ships. And Earth never lost a ship; by the time the\nKerothi ships knew their enemy was in the vicinity, the enemy had hit\nand vanished again. The Kerothi never had a chance to ready their\nweapons.\n\nIn the long run, they never had a chance at all.\n\nMacMaine waited with almost fatalistic complacence for the inevitable\nto happen. When it did happen, he was ready for it.\n\nThe _Shudos_, tiny flagship of what had once been a mighty armada and\nwas now only a tattered remnant, was floating in orbit, along with the\nother remaining ships of the fleet, around a bloated red-giant sun.\nWith their drives off, there was no way of detecting them at any\ndistance, and the chance of their being found by accident was\nmicroscopically small. But they could not wait forever. Water could be\nrecirculated, and energy could be tapped from the nearby sun, but food\nwas gone once it was eaten.\n\nHokotan's decision was inevitable, and, under the circumstances, the\nonly possible one. He simple told them what they had already\nknown--that he was a Headquarters Staff officer.\n\n\"We haven't heard from Headquarters in weeks,\" he said at last. \"The\nEarth fleet may already be well inside our periphery. We'll have to go\nhome.\" He produced a document which he had obviously been holding in\nreserve for another purpose and handed it to Tallis. \"Headquarters\nStaff Orders, Tallis. It empowers me to take command of the Fleet in\nthe event of an emergency, and the decision as to what constitutes an\nemergency was left up to my discretion. I must admit that this is not\nthe emergency any of us at Headquarters anticipated.\"\n\nTallis read through the document. \"I see that it isn't,\" he said dryly.\n\"According to this, MacMaine and I are to be placed under immediate\narrest as soon as you find it necessary to act.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Hokotan bitterly. \"So you can both consider yourselves\nunder arrest. Don't bother to lock yourselves up--there's no point in\nit. General MacMaine, I see no reason to inform the rest of the Fleet\nof this, so we will go on as usual. The orders I have to give are\nsimple: The Fleet will head for home by the most direct possible\ngeodesic. Since we cannot fight, we will simply ignore attacks and keep\ngoing as long as we last. We can do nothing else.\" He paused\nthoughtfully.\n\n\"And, General MacMaine, in case we do not live through this, I would\nlike to extend my apologies. I do not like you; I don't think I could\never learn to like an anim ... to like a non-Kerothi. But I know when\nto admit an error in judgment. You have fought bravely and\nwell--better, I know, than I could have done myself. You have shown\nyourself to be loyal to your adopted planet; you are a Kerothi in every\nsense of the word except the physical. My apologies for having wronged\nyou.\"\n\nHe extended his hands and MacMaine took them. A choking sensation\nconstricted the Earthman's throat for a moment, then he got the words\nout--the words he had to say. \"Believe me, General Hokotan, there is no\nneed for an apology. No need whatever.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Hokotan. Then he turned and left the room.\n\n\"All right, Tallis,\" MacMaine said hurriedly, \"let's get moving.\"\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nThe orders were given to the remnants of the Fleet, and they cut in\ntheir drives to head homeward. And the instant they did, there was\nchaos. Earth's fleet of \"ghost ships\" had been patrolling the area for\nweeks, knowing that the Kerothi fleet had last been detected somewhere\nin the vicinity. As soon as the spatial distortions of the Kerothi\ndrives flashed on the Earth ships' detectors, the Earth fleet, widely\nscattered over the whole circumambient volume of space, coalesced\ntoward the center of the spatial disturbance like a cloud of bees all\nheading for the same flower.\n\nWhere there had been only the dull red light of the giant star, there\nsuddenly appeared the blinding, blue-white brilliance of disintegrating\nmatter, blossoming like cruel, deadly, beautiful flowers in the midst\nof the Kerothi ships, then fading slowly as each expanding cloud of\nplasma cooled.\n\nSebastian MacMaine might have died with the others except that the\n_Shudos_, as the flagship, was to trail behind the fleet, so her drive\nhad not yet been activated. The _Shudos_ was still in orbit, moving at\nonly a few miles per second when the Earth fleet struck.\n\nHer drive never did go on. A bomb, only a short distance away as the\ndistance from atomic disintegration is measured, sent the _Shudos_\nspinning away, end over end, like a discarded cigar butt flipped toward\na gutter, one side caved in near the rear, as if it had been kicked in\nby a giant foot.\n\nThere was still air in the ship, MacMaine realized groggily as he awoke\nfrom the unconsciousness that had been thrust upon him. He tried to\nstand up, but he found himself staggering toward one crazily-slanted\nwall. The stagger was partly due to his grogginess, and partly due to\nthe Coriolis forces acting within the spinning ship. The artificial\ngravity was gone, which meant that the interstellar drive engines had\nbeen smashed. He wondered if the emergency rocket drive was still\nworking--not that it would take him anywhere worth going to in less\nthan a few centuries. But, then, Sebastian MacMaine had nowhere to go,\nanyhow.\n\nTallis lay against one wall, looking very limp. MacMaine half staggered\nover to him and knelt down. Tallis was still alive.\n\nThe centrifugal force caused by the spinning ship gave an effective\npull of less than one Earth gravity, but the weird twists caused by the\nCoriolis forces made motion and orientation difficult. Besides, the\nship was spinning slightly on her long axis as well as turning\nend-for-end.\n\nMacMaine stood there for a moment, trying to think. He had expected to\ndie. Death was something he had known was inevitable from the moment he\nmade his decision to leave Earth. He had not known how or when it would\ncome, but he had known that it would come soon. He had known that he\nwould never live to collect the reward he had demanded of the Kerothi\nfor \"faithful service.\" Traitor he might be, but he was still honest\nenough with himself to know that he would never take payment for\nservices he had not rendered.\n\nNow death was very near, and Sebastian MacMaine almost welcomed it. He\nhad no desire to fight it. Tallis might want to stand and fight death\nto the end, but Tallis was not carrying the monstrous weight of guilt\nthat would stay with Sebastian MacMaine until his death, no matter how\nmuch he tried to justify his actions.\n\nOn the other hand, if he had to go, he might as well do a good job of\nit. Since he still had a short time left, he might as well wrap the\nwhole thing up in a neat package. How?\n\nAgain, his intuitive ability to see pattern gave him the answer long\nbefore he could have reasoned it out.\n\n_They will know_, he thought, _but they will never be sure they know. I\nwill be immortal. And my name will live forever, although no Earthman\nwill ever again use the surname MacMaine or the given name Sebastian_.\n\nHe shook his head to clear it. No use thinking like that now. There\nwere things to be done.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nTallis first. MacMaine made his way over to one of the emergency\nmedical kits that he knew were kept in every compartment of every ship.\nOne of the doors of a wall locker hung open, and the blue-green medical\nsymbol used by the Kerothi showed darkly in the dim light that came\nfrom the three unshattered glow plates in the ceiling. He opened the\nkit, hoping that it contained something equivalent to adhesive tape. He\nhad never inspected a Kerothi medical kit before. Fortunately, he could\nread Kerothi. If a military government was good for nothing else, at\nleast it was capable of enforcing a simplified phonetic orthography so\nthat words were pronounced as they were spelled. And--\n\nHe forced his wandering mind back to his work. The blow on the head,\nplus the crazy effect the spinning was having on his inner ears, plus\nthe cockeyed gravitational orientation that made his eyes feel as\nthough they were seeing things at two different angles, all combined to\nmake for more than a little mental confusion.\n\nThere was adhesive tape, all right. Wound on its little spool, it\nlooked almost homey. He spent several minutes winding the sticky\nplastic ribbon around Tallis' wrists and ankles.\n\nThen he took the gun from the Kerothi general's sleeve holster--he had\nnever been allowed one of his own--and, holding it firmly in his right\nhand, he went on a tour of the ship.\n\nIt was hard to move around. The centrifugal force varied from point to\npoint throughout the ship, and the corridors were cluttered with debris\nthat seemed to move with a life of its own as each piece shifted slowly\nunder the effects of the various forces working on it. And, as the\nvarious masses moved about, the rate of spin of the ship changed as the\nlaw of conservation of angular momentum operated. The ship was full of\nsliding, clattering, jangling noises as the stuff tried to find a final\nresting place and bring the ship to equilibrium.\n\nHe found the door to Ossif's cabin open and the room empty. He found\nOssif in Loopat's cabin, trying to get the younger officer to his feet.\n\nOssif saw MacMaine at the door and said: \"You're alive! Good! Help\nme----\" Then he saw the gun in MacMaine's hand and stopped. It was the\nlast thing he saw before MacMaine shot him neatly between the eyes.\n\nLoopat, only half conscious, never even knew he was in danger, and the\nblast that drilled through his brain prevented him from ever knowing\nanything again in this life.\n\nLike a man in a dream, MacMaine went on to Hokotan's cabin, his weapon\nat the ready. He was rather pleased to find that the HQ general was\nalready quite dead, his neck broken as cleanly as if it had been done\nby a hangman. Hardly an hour before, MacMaine would cheerfully have\nshot Hokotan where it would hurt the most and watch him die slowly. But\nthe memory of Hokotan's honest apology made the Earthman very glad that\nhe did not have to shoot the general at all.\n\nThere remained only the five-man crew, the NCO technician and his gang,\nwho actually ran the ship. They would be at the tail of the ship, in\nthe engine compartment. To get there, he had to cross the center of\nspin of the ship, and the change of gravity from one direction to\nanother, decreasing toward zero, passing the null point, and rising\nagain on the other side, made him nauseous. He felt better after his\nstomach had emptied itself.\n\nCautiously, he opened the door to the drive compartment and then\nslammed it hard in sudden fear when he saw what had happened. The\nshielding had been torn away from one of the energy converters and\nexposed the room to high-energy radiation. The crewmen were quite dead.\n\nThe fear went away as quickly as it had come. So maybe he'd dosed\nhimself with a few hundred Roentgens--so what? A little radiation never\nhurt a dead man.\n\nBut he knew now that there was no possibility of escape. The drive was\nwrecked, and the only other means of escape, the one-man courier boat\nthat every blaster-boat carried, had been sent out weeks ago and had\nnever returned.\n\nIf only the courier boat were still in its cradle--\n\nMacMaine shook his head. No. It was better this way. Much better.\n\nHe turned and went back to the dining cabin where Tallis was trussed\nup. This time, passing the null-gee point didn't bother him much at\nall.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nTallis was moaning a little and his eyelids were fluttering by the time\nMacMaine got back. The Earthman opened the medical kit again and looked\nfor some kind of stimulant. He had no knowledge of medical or chemical\nterms in Kerothic, but there was a box of glass ampoules bearing\ninstructions to \"crush and allow patient to inhale fumes.\" That sounded\nright.\n\nThe stuff smelled like a mixture of spirits of ammonia and butyl\nmercaptan, but it did the job. Tallis coughed convulsively, turned his\nhead away, coughed again, and opened his eyes. MacMaine tossed the\nstinking ampoule out into the corridor as Tallis tried to focus his\neyes.\n\n\"How do you feel?\" MacMaine asked. His voice sounded oddly thick in his\nown ears.\n\n\"All right. I'm all right. What happened?\" He looked wonderingly\naround. \"Near miss? Must be. Anyone hurt?\"\n\n\"They're all dead but you and me,\" MacMaine said.\n\n\"Dead? Then we'd better----\" He tried to move and then realized that he\nwas bound hand and foot. The sudden realization of his position seemed\nto clear his brain completely. \"Sepastian, what's going on here? Why am\nI tied up?\"\n\n\"I had to tie you,\" MacMaine explained carefully, as though to a child.\n\"There are some things I have to do yet, and I wouldn't want you to\nstop me. Maybe I should have just shot you while you were unconscious.\nThat would have been kinder to both of us, I think. But ... but,\nTallis, I had to tell somebody. Someone else has to know. Someone else\nhas to judge. Or maybe I just want to unload it on someone else,\nsomeone who will carry the burden with me for just a little while. I\ndon't know.\"\n\n\"Sepastian, what are you talking about?\" The Kerothi's face shone dully\norange in the dim light, his bright green eyes looked steadily at the\nEarthman, and his voice was oddly gentle.\n\n\"I'm talking about treason,\" said MacMaine. \"Do you want to listen?\"\n\n\"I don't have much choice, do I?\" Tallis said. \"Tell me one thing\nfirst: Are we going to die?\"\n\n\"You are, Tallis. But I won't. I'm going to be immortal.\"\n\nTallis looked at him for a long moment. Then, \"All right, Sepastian.\nI'm no psych man, but I know you're not well. I'll listen to whatever\nyou have to say. But first, untie my hands and feet.\"\n\n\"I can't do that, Tallis. Sorry. But if our positions were reversed, I\nknow what I would do to you when I heard the story. And I can't let you\nkill me, because there's something more that has to be done.\"\n\nTallis knew at that moment that he was looking at the face of Death.\nAnd he also knew that there was nothing whatever he could do about it.\nExcept talk. And listen.\n\n\"Very well, Sepastian,\" he said levelly. \"Go ahead. Treason, you say?\nHow? Against whom?\"\n\n\"I'm not quite sure,\" said Sebastian MacMaine. \"I thought maybe you\ncould tell me.\"\n\n\n\n\n_The Reason_\n\n\n\"Let me ask you one thing, Tallis,\" MacMaine said. \"Would you do\nanything in your power to save Keroth from destruction? Anything, no\nmatter how drastic, if you knew that it would save Keroth in the long\nrun?\"\n\n\"A foolish question. Of course I would. I would give my life.\"\n\n\"Your life? A mere nothing. A pittance. Any man could give his life.\nWould you consent to live forever for Keroth?\"\n\nTallis shook his head as though he were puzzled. \"Live forever? That's\ntwice or three times you've said something about that. I _don't_\nunderstand you.\"\n\n\"Would you consent to live forever as a filthy curse on the lips of\nevery Kerothi old enough to speak? Would you consent to be a vile,\ninhuman monster whose undead spirit would hang over your homeland like\nan evil miasma for centuries to come, whose very name would touch a\nflame of hatred in the minds of all who heard it?\"\n\n\"That's a very melodramatic way of putting it,\" the Kerothi said, \"but\nI believe I understand what you mean. Yes, I would consent to that if\nit would be the only salvation of Keroth.\"\n\n\"Would you slaughter helpless millions of your own people so that other\nbillions might survive? Would you ruthlessly smash your system of\ngovernment and your whole way of life if it were the only way to save\nthe people themselves?\"\n\n\"I'm beginning to see what you're driving at,\" Tallis said slowly. \"And\nif it is what I think it is, I think I would like to kill you--very\nslowly.\"\n\n\"I know, I know. But you haven't answered my question. Would you do\nthose things to save your people?\"\n\n\"I would,\" said Tallis coldly. \"Don't misunderstand me. I do not loathe\nyou for what you have done to your own people; I hate you for what you\nhave done to mine.\"\n\n\"That's as it should be,\" said MacMaine. His head was clearing up more\nnow. He realized that he had been talking a little wildly at first. Or\nwas he really insane? Had he been insane from the beginning? No. He\nknew with absolute clarity that every step he had made had been cold,\ncalculating, and ruthless, but utterly and absolutely sane.\n\nHe suddenly wished that he had shot Tallis without wakening him. If his\nmind hadn't been in such a state of shock, he would have. There was no\nneed to torture the man like this.\n\n\"Go on,\" said Tallis, in a voice that had suddenly become devoid of all\nemotion. \"Tell it all.\"\n\n\"Earth was stagnating,\" MacMaine said, surprised at the sound of his\nown voice. He hadn't intended to go on. But he couldn't stop now. \"You\nsaw how it was. Every standard had become meaningless because no\nstandard was held to be better than any other standard. There was no\nbeauty because beauty was superior to ugliness and we couldn't allow\nsuperiority or inferiority. There was no love because in order to love\nsomeone or something you must feel that it is in some way superior to\nthat which is not loved. I'm not even sure I know what those terms\nmean, because I'm not sure I ever thought anything was beautiful, I'm\nnot sure I ever loved anything. I only read about such things in books.\nBut I know I felt the emptiness inside me where those things should\nhave been.\n\n\"There was no morality, either. People did not refrain from stealing\nbecause it was wrong, but simply because it was pointless to steal what\nwould be given to you if you asked for it. There was no right or wrong.\n\n\"We had a form of social contract that we called 'marriage,' but it\nwasn't the same thing as marriage was in the old days. There was no\nlove. There used to be a crime called 'adultery,' but even the word had\ngone out of use on the Earth I knew. Instead, it was considered\nantisocial for a woman to refuse to give herself to other men; to do so\nmight indicate that she thought herself superior or thought her husband\nto be superior to other men. The same thing applied to men in their\nrelationships with women other than their wives. Marriage was a social\ncontract that could be made or broken at the whim of the individual. It\nserved no purpose because it meant nothing, neither party gained\nanything by the contract that they couldn't have had without it. But a\nwedding was an excuse for a gala party at which the couple were the\ncenter of attention. So the contract was entered into lightly for the\nsake of a gay time for a while, then broken again so that the game\ncould be played with someone else--the game of Musical Bedrooms.\"\n\nHe stopped and looked down at the helpless Kerothi. \"That doesn't mean\nmuch to you, does it? In your society, women are chattel, to be owned,\nbought, and sold. If you see a woman you want, you offer a price to her\nfather or brother or husband--whoever the owner might be. Then she's\nyours until you sell her to another. Adultery is a very serious crime\non Kerothi, but only because it's an infringement of property rights.\nThere's not much love lost there, either, is there?\n\n\"I wonder if either of us knows what love is, Tallis?\"\n\n\"I love my people,\" Tallis said grimly.\n\nMacMaine was startled for a moment. He'd never thought about it that\nway. \"You're right, Tallis,\" he said at last. \"You're right. We _do_\nknow. And because I loved the human race, in spite of its stagnation\nand its spirit of total mediocrity, I did what I had to do.\"\n\n\"You will pardon me,\" Tallis said, with only the faintest bit of acid\nin his voice, \"if I do not understand exactly what it is that you did.\"\nThen his voice grew softer. \"Wait. Perhaps I do understand. Yes, of\ncourse.\"\n\n\"You think you understand?\" MacMaine looked at him narrowly.\n\n\"Yes. I said that I am not a psychomedic, and my getting angry with you\nproves it. You fought hard and well for Keroth, Sepastian, and, in\ndoing so, you had to kill many of your own race. It is not easy for a\nman to do, no matter how much your reason tells you it _must_ be done.\nAnd now, in the face of death, remorse has come. I do not completely\nunderstand the workings of the Earthman's mind, but I----\"\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\n\"That's just it; you don't,\" MacMaine interrupted. \"Thanks for trying\nto find an excuse for me, Tallis, but I'm afraid it isn't so. Listen.\n\n\"I had to find out what Earth was up against. I had a pretty good idea\nalready that the Kerothi would win--would wipe us out or enslave us to\nthe last man. And, after I had seen Keroth, I was certain of it. So I\nsent a message back to Earth, telling them what they were up against,\nbecause, up 'til then they hadn't known. As soon as they knew, they\nreacted as they have always done when they are certain that they face\ndanger. They fought. They unleashed the chained-down intelligence of\nthe few extraordinary Earthmen, and they released the fighting spirit\nof even the ordinary Earthmen. And they won!\"\n\nTallis shook his head. \"You sent no message, Sepastian. You were\nwatched. You know that. You could not have sent a message.\"\n\n\"You saw me send it,\" MacMaine said. \"So did everyone else in the\nfleet. Hokotan helped me send it--made all the arrangements at my\norders. But because you do not understand the workings of the\nEarthman's mind, you didn't even recognize it as a message.\n\n\"Tallis, what would your people have done if an invading force, which\nhad already proven that it could whip Keroth easily, did to one of your\nplanets what we did on Houston's World?\"\n\n\"If the enemy showed us that they could easily beat us and then hanged\nthe whole population of a planet for resisting? Why, we would be fools\nto resist. Unless, of course, we had a secret weapon in a hidden\npocket, the way Earth had.\"\n\n\"No, Tallis; no. That's where you're making your mistake. Earth didn't\nhave that weapon until _after_ the massacre on Houston's World. Let me\nask you another thing: Would any Kerothi have ordered that massacre?\"\n\n\"I doubt it,\" Tallis said slowly. \"Killing that many potential slaves\nwould be wasteful and expensive. We are fighters, not butchers. We kill\nonly when it is necessary to win; the remainder of the enemy is taken\ncare of as the rightful property of the conqueror.\"\n\n\"Exactly. Prisoners were part of the loot, and it's foolish to destroy\nloot. I noticed that in your history books. I noticed, too, that in\nsuch cases, the captives recognized the right of the conqueror to\nenslave them, and made no trouble. So, after Earth's forces get to\nKeroth, I don't think we'll have any trouble with you.\"\n\n\"Not if they set us an example like Houston's World,\" Tallis said, \"and\ncan prove that resistance is futile. But I don't understand the\nmessage. What was the message and how did you send it?\"\n\n\"The massacre on Houston's World was the message, Tallis. I even told\nthe Staff, when I suggested it. I said that such an act would strike\nterror into the minds of Earthmen.\n\n\"And it did, Tallis; it did. But that terror was just the goad they\nneeded to make them fight. They had to sit up and take notice. If the\nKerothi had gone on the way they were going, taking one planet after\nanother, as they planned, the Kerothi would have won. The people of\neach planet would think, 'It can't happen here.' And, since they felt\nthat nothing could be superior to anything else, they were complacently\ncertain that they couldn't be beat. Of course, maybe Earth couldn't\nbeat you, either, but that was all right; it just proved that there was\nno such thing as superiority.\n\n\"But Houston's World jarred them--badly. It had to. 'Hell does more\nthan Heaven can to wake the fear of God in man.' They didn't recognize\nbeauty, but I shoved ugliness down their throats; they didn't know love\nand friendship, so I gave them hatred and fear.\n\n\"The committing of atrocities has been the mistake of aggressors\nthroughout Earth's history. The battle cries of countless wars have\ncalled upon the people to remember an atrocity. Nothing else hits an\nEarthman as hard as a vicious, brutal, unnecessary murder.\n\n\"So I gave them the incentive to fight, Tallis. That was my message.\"\n\nTallis was staring at him wide eyed. \"You _are_ insane.\"\n\n\"No. It worked. In six months, they found something that would enable\nthem to blast the devil Kerothi from the skies. I don't know what the\nsociety of Earth is like now--and I never will. But at least I know\nthat men are allowed to think again. And I know they'll survive.\"\n\nHe suddenly realized how much time had passed. Had it been too long?\nNo. There would still be Earth ships prowling the vicinity, waiting for\nany sign of a Kerothi ship that had hidden in the vastness of space by\nnot using its engines.\n\n\"I have some things I must do, Tallis,\" he said, standing up slowly.\n\"Is there anything else you want to know?\"\n\nTallis frowned a little, as though he were trying to think of\nsomething, but then he closed his eyes and relaxed. \"No, Sepastian.\nNothing. Do whatever it is you have to do.\"\n\n\"Tallis,\" MacMaine said. Tallis didn't open his eyes, and MacMaine was\nvery glad of that. \"Tallis, I want you to know that, in all my life,\nyou were the only friend I ever had.\"\n\nThe bright green eyes remained closed. \"That may be so. Yes, Sepastian,\nI honestly think you believe that.\"\n\n\"I do,\" said MacMaine, and shot him carefully through the head.\n\n_The End_\n\n\n--_and Epilogue._\n\n\"Hold it!\" The voice bellowed thunderingly from the loud-speakers of\nthe six Earth ships that had boxed in the derelict. \"Hold it! _Don't\nbomb that ship!_ I'll personally have the head of any man who damages\nthat ship!\"\n\nIn five of the ships, the commanders simply held off the bombardment\nthat would have vaporized the derelict. In the sixth, Major Thornton,\nthe Group Commander, snapped off the microphone. His voice was shaky as\nhe said: \"That was close! Another second, and we'd have lost that ship\nforever.\"\n\nCaptain Verenski's Oriental features had a half-startled, half-puzzled\nlook. \"I don't get it. You grabbed that mike control as if you'd been\nbitten. I know that she's only a derelict. After that burst of\nfifty-gee acceleration for fifteen minutes, there couldn't be anyone\nleft alive on her. But there must have been a reason for using atomic\nrockets instead of their antiacceleration fields. What makes you think\nshe's not dangerous?\"\n\n\"I didn't say she wasn't dangerous,\" the major snapped. \"She may be.\nProbably is. But we're going to capture her if we can. Look!\" He\npointed at the image of the ship in the screen.\n\nShe wasn't spinning now, or looping end-over-end. After fifteen minutes\nof high acceleration, her atomic rockets had cut out, and now she moved\nserenely at constant velocity, looking as dead as a battered tin can.\n\n\"I don't see anything,\" Captain Verenski said.\n\n\"The Kerothic symbols on the side. Palatal unvoiced sibilant, rounded----\"\n\n\"I don't read Kerothic, major,\" said the captain. \"I----\" Then he\nblinked and said, \"_Shudos!_\"\n\n\"That's it. The _Shudos_ of Keroth. The flagship of the Kerothi Fleet.\"\n\nThe look in the major's eyes was the same look of hatred that had come\ninto the captain's.\n\n\"Even if its armament is still functioning, we have to take the chance,\"\nMajor Thornton said. \"Even if they're all dead, we have to try to get\nThe Butcher's body.\" He picked up the microphone again.\n\n\"Attention, Group. Listen carefully and don't get itchy trigger fingers.\nThat ship is the _Shudos_. The Butcher's ship. It's a ten-man ship, and\nthe most she could have aboard would be thirty, even if they jammed her\nfull to the hull. I don't know of any way that anyone could be alive on\nher after fifteen minutes at fifty gees of atomic drive, but remember\nthat they don't have any idea of how our counteraction generators damp\nout spatial distortion either. Remember what Dr. Pendric said: 'No man\nis superior to any other in _all_ ways. Every man is superior to every\nother in _some_ way.' We may have the counteraction generator, but they\nmay have something else that we don't know about. So stay alert.\n\n\"I am going to take a landing-party aboard. There's a reward out for\nThe Butcher, and that reward will be split proportionately among us.\nIt's big enough for us all to enjoy it, and we'll probably get\ncitations if we bring him in.\n\n\"I want ten men from each ship. I'm not asking for volunteers; I want\neach ship commander to pick the ten men he thinks will be least likely\nto lose their heads in an emergency. I don't want anyone to panic and\nshoot when he should be thinking. I don't want anyone who had any\nrelatives on Houston's World. Sorry, but I can't allow vengeance yet.\n\n\"We're a thousand miles from the _Shudos_ now; close in slowly until\nwe're within a hundred yards. The boarding parties will don armor and\nprepare to board while we're closing in. At a hundred yards, we stop\nand the boarding parties will land on the hull. I'll give further\norders then.\n\n\"One more thing. I don't think her A-A generators could possibly be\nfunctioning, judging from that dent in her hull, but we can't be sure.\nIf she tries to go into A-A drive, she is to be bombed--no matter who\nis aboard. It is better that sixty men die than that The Butcher\nescape.\n\n\"All right, let's go. Move in.\"\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nHalf an hour later, Major Thornton stood on the hull of the _Shudos_,\nsurrounded by the sixty men of the boarding party. \"Anybody see\nanything through those windows?\" he asked.\n\nSeveral of the men had peered through the direct-vision ports, playing\nspotlight beams through them.\n\n\"Nothing alive,\" said a sergeant, a remark which was followed by a\nchorus of agreement.\n\n\"Pretty much of a mess in there,\" said another sergeant. \"That fifty\ngees mashed everything to the floor. Why'd anyone want to use\nacceleration like that?\"\n\n\"Let's go in and find out,\" said Major Thornton.\n\nThe outer door to the air lock was closed, but not locked. It swung\nopen easily to disclose the room between the outer and inner doors. Ten\nmen went in with the major, the others stayed outside with orders to\ncut through the hull if anything went wrong.\n\n\"If he's still alive,\" the major said, \"we don't want to kill him by\nblowing the air. Sergeant, start the airlock cycle.\"\n\nThere was barely room for ten men in the air lock. It had been built\nbig enough for the full crew to use it at one time, but it was only\njust big enough.\n\nWhen the inner door opened, they went in cautiously. They spread out\nand searched cautiously. The caution was unnecessary, as it turned out.\nThere wasn't a living thing aboard.\n\n\"Three officers shot through the head, sir,\" said the sergeant. \"One of\n'em looks like he died of a broken neck, but it's hard to tell after\nthat fifty gees mashed 'em. Crewmen in the engine room--five of 'em.\nMashed up, but I'd say they died of radiation, since the shielding on\none of the generators was ruptured by the blast that made that dent in\nthe hull.\"\n\n\"Nine bodies,\" the major said musingly. \"All Kerothi. And all of them\nprobably dead _before_ the fifty-gee acceleration. Keep looking,\nsergeant. We've got to find the tenth man.\"\n\nAnother twenty-minute search gave them all the information they were\never to get.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\n\"No Earth food aboard,\" said the major. \"One spacesuit missing.\nHandweapons missing. Two emergency survival kits and two medical kits\nmissing. _And_--most important of all--the courier boat is missing.\" He\nbit at his lower lip for a moment, then went on. \"Outer air lock door\nleft unlocked. Three Kerothi shot--_after_ the explosion that ruined\nthe A-A drive, and _before_ the fifty-gee acceleration.\" He looked at\nthe sergeant. \"What do you think happened?\"\n\n\"He got away,\" the tough-looking noncom said grimly. \"Took the courier\nboat and scooted away from here.\"\n\n\"Why did he set the timer on the drive, then? What was the purpose of\nthat fifty-gee blast?\"\n\n\"To distract us, I'd say, sir. While we were chasing this thing, he\nhightailed it out.\"\n\n\"He might have, at that,\" the major said musingly. \"A one-man courier\n_could_ have gotten away. Our new detection equipment isn't perfect\nyet. But----\"\n\nAt that moment, one of the troopers pushed himself down the corridor\ntoward them. \"Look, sir! I found this in the pocket of the Carrot-skin\nwho was taped up in there!\" He was holding a piece of paper.\n\nThe major took it, read it, then read it aloud. \"Greetings, fellow\nEarthmen: When you read this, I will be safe from any power you may\nthink you have to arrest or punish me. But don't think _you_ are safe\nfrom _me_. There are other intelligent races in the galaxy, and I'll be\naround for a long time to come. You haven't heard the last of me. With\nlove--Sebastian MacMaine.\"\n\nThe silence that followed was almost deadly.\n\n\"He _did_ get away!\" snarled the sergeant at last.\n\n\"Maybe,\" said the major. \"But it doesn't make sense.\" He sounded\nagitated. \"Look. In the first place, how do we know the courier boat\nwas even aboard? They've been trying frantically to get word back to\nKeroth; does it make sense that they'd save this boat? And why all the\nfanfare? Suppose he did have a boat? Why would he attract our attention\nwith that fifty-gee flare? Just so he could leave us a note?\"\n\n\"What do you think happened, sir?\" the sergeant asked.\n\n\"I don't think he had a boat. If he did, he'd want us to think he was\ndead, not the other way around. I think he set the drive timer on this\nship, went outside with his supplies, crawled up a drive tube and\nwaited until that atomic rocket blast blew him into plasma. He was\nprobably badly wounded and didn't want us to know that we'd won. That\nway, we'd never find him.\"\n\nThere was no belief on the faces of the men around him.\n\n\"Why'd he want to do that, sir?\" asked the sergeant.\n\n\"Because as long as we don't _know_, he'll haunt us. He'll be like\nHitler or Jack the Ripper. He'll be an immortal menace instead of a\ndead villain who could be forgotten.\"\n\n\"Maybe so, sir,\" said the sergeant, but there was an utter lack of\nconviction in his voice. \"But we'd still better comb this area and keep\nour detectors hot. We'll know what he was up to when we catch him.\"\n\n\"But if we _don't_ find him,\" the major said softly, \"we'll _never_\nknow. That's the beauty of it, sergeant. If we don't find him, then\nhe's won. In his own fiendish, twisted way, he's won.\"\n\n\"If we don't find him,\" said the sergeant stolidly, \"I think we better\nkeep a sharp eye out for the next intelligent race we meet. He might\nfind 'em first.\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" said the major very softly, \"that's just what he wanted. I\nwish I knew why.\"\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Highest Treason, by Randall Garrett\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE HIGHEST TREASON ***\n\n***** This file should be named 24302.txt or 24302.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/3/0/24302/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks and the Online Distributed\nProofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
