A race, incidentally, that was\nscientifically so far in advance of ours that they held the secret of\nthe restoration of life!\n\nOne member of that race can be brought back after 500,000 years of\ndeath....\n\nThat's the story told by this ORIGINAL book-length novel, which has\nnever before been published! You can expect a muscle-tightening,\nsweat-producing, mind-prodding adventure in the future when you read\nit!\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER ONE_\n\n\nOut beyond the orbit of Mars the _Lavoisier_ wallowed cautiously\nthrough the asteroid fields. Aboard the laboratory ship few of the\nmembers of the permanent Smithson Asteroidal Expedition were aware\nthat they were in motion. Living in the field one or two years at\na time, there was little that they were conscious of except the\nhalf-million-year-old culture whose scattered fragments surrounded them\non every side.\n\nThe only contact with Earth at the moment was the radio link by which\nDr. Delmar Underwood was calling Dr. Illia Morov at Terrestrial Medical\nCentral.\n\nIllia's blonde, precisely coiffured hair was only faintly golden\nagainst, the stark white of her surgeons' gown, which she still wore\nwhen she answered. Her eyes widened with an expression of pleasure as\nher face came into focus on the screen and she recognized Underwood.\n\n\"Del! I thought you'd gone to sleep with the mummies out there. It's\nbeen over a month since you called. What's new?\"\n\n\"Not much. Terry found some new evidence of Stroid III. Phyfe has a\nnew scrap of metal with inscriptions, and they've found something that\nalmost looks as if it might have been an electron tube five hundred\nthousand years ago. I'm working on that. Otherwise all is peaceful and\nit's wonderful!\"\n\n\"Still the confirmed hermit?\" Illia's eyes lost some of their banter,\nbut none of their tenderness.\n\n\"There's more peace and contentment out here than I'd ever dreamed of\nfinding. I want you to come out here, Illia. Come out for a month. If\nyou don't want to stay and marry me, then you can go back and I won't\nsay another word.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe shook her head in firm decision. \"Earth needs its scientists\ndesperately. Too many have run away already. They say the Venusian\ncolonies are booming, but I told you a year ago that simply running\naway wouldn't work. I thought by now you would have found it out for\nyourself.\"\n\n\"And I told you a year ago,\" Underwood said flatly, \"that the only\npossible choice of a sane man is escape.\"\n\n\"You can't escape your own culture, Del. Why, the expedition that\nprovided the opportunity for you to become a hermit is dependent on\nEarth. If Congress should cut the Institute's funds, you'd be dropped\nright back where you were. You can't get away.\"\n\n\"There are always the Venusian colonies.\"\n\n\"You know it's impossible to exist there independent of Earth.\"\n\n\"I'm not talking about the science and technology. I'm talking about\nthe social disintegration. Certainly a scientist doesn't need to take\nthat with him when he's attempting to escape it.\"\n\n\"The culture is not to blame,\" said Illia earnestly, \"and neither is\nhumanity. You don't ridicule a child for his clumsiness when he is\nlearning to walk.\"\n\n\"I hope the human race is past its childhood!\"\n\n\"Relatively speaking, it isn't. Dreyer says we're only now emerging\nfrom the cave man stage, and that could properly be called mankind's\ninfancy, I suppose. Dreyer calls it the 'head man' stage.\"\n\n\"I thought he was a semanticist.\"\n\n\"You'd know if you'd ever talked with him. He'll tear off every other\nword you utter and throw it back at you. His 'head man' designation\nis correct, all right. According to him, human beings in this stage\nneed some leader or 'head man' stronger than themselves for guidance,\nassumption of responsibility, and blame, in case of failure of the\ngroup. These functions have never in the past been developed in the\nindividual so that he could stand alone in control of his own ego. But\nit's coming--that's the whole import of Dreyer's work.\"\n\n\"And all this confusion and instability are supposed to have something\nto do with that?\"\n\n\"It's been growing for decades. We've seen it reach a peak in our own\nlifetimes. The old fetishes have failed, the head men have been found\nto be hollow gods, and men's faith has turned to derision. Presidents,\ndictators, governors, and priests--they've all fallen from their high\nplaces and the masses of humanity will no longer believe in any of\nthem.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"And _that_ is development of the race?\"\n\n\"Yes, because out of it will come a people who have found in themselves\nthe strength they used to find in the 'head men.' There will come a\nrace in which the individual can accept the responsibility which he\nhas always passed on to the 'head man,' the 'head man' is no longer\nnecessary.\"\n\n\"And so--the ultimate anarchy.\"\n\n\"The 'head man' concept has, but first he has to find out that\nhas nothing to do with government. With human beings capable of\nindependent, constructive behavior, actual democracy will be possible\nfor the first time in the world's history.\"\n\n\"If all this is to come about anyway, according to Dreyer, why not try\nto escape the insanity of the transition period?\"\n\nIllia Morov's eyes grew narrow in puzzlement as she looked at Underwood\nwith utter incomprehension. \"Doesn't it matter at all that the race is\nin one of the greatest crises of all history? Doesn't it matter that\nyou have a skill that is of immense value in these times? It's peculiar\nthat it is those of you in the physical sciences who are fleeing in\nthe greatest numbers. The Venusian colonies must have a wonderful time\nwith physicists trampling each other to get away from it all--and Earth\nalmost barren of them. Do the physical sciences destroy every sense of\nsocial obligation?\"\n\n\"You forget that I don't quite accept Dreyer's theories. To me this is\nnothing but a rotting structure that is finally collapsing from its own\ninner decay. I can't see anything positive evolving out of it.\"\n\n\"I suppose so. Well, it was nice of you to call, Del. I'm always glad\nto hear you. Don't wait so long next time.\"\n\n\"Illia--\"\n\nBut she had cut the connection and the screen slowly faded into gray,\nleaving Underwood's argument unfinished. Irritably, he flipped the\nswitch to the public news channels.\n\nWhere was he wrong? The past year, since he had joined the expedition\nas Chief Physicist, was like paradise compared with living in the\nunstable, irresponsible society existing on Earth. He knew it was a\npurely neurotic reaction, this desire to escape. But application of\nthat label solved nothing, explained nothing--and carried no stigma.\nThe neurotic reaction was the norm in a world so confused.\n\nHe turned as the news blared abruptly with its perpetual urgency that\nmade him wonder how the commentators endured the endless flow of crises.\n\nThe President had been impeached again--the third one in six months.\n\nThere were no candidates for his office.\n\nA church had been burned by its congregation.\n\nTwo mayors had been assassinated within hours of each other.\n\nIt was the same news he had heard six months ago. It would be the same\nagain tomorrow and next month. The story of a planet repudiating all\nleadership. A lawlessness that was worse than anarchy, because there\nwas still government--a government that could be driven and whipped by\nthe insecurities of the populace that elected it.\n\nDreyer called it a futile search for a 'head man' by a people who would\nno longer trust any of their own kind to be 'head man.' And Underwood\ndared not trust that glib explanation.\n\nMany others besides Underwood found they could no longer endure the\ninstability of their own culture. Among these were many of the world's\nleading scientists. Most of them went to the jungle lands of Venus. The\nscientific limitations of such a frontier existence had kept Underwood\nfrom joining the Venusian colonies, but he'd been very close to going\njust before he got the offer of Chief Physicist with the Smithson\nInstitute expedition in the asteroid fields. He wondered now what he'd\nhave done if the offer hadn't come.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe interphone annunciator buzzed. Underwood turned off the news as\nthe bored communications operator in the control room announced, \"Doc\nUnderwood. Call for Doc Underwood.\"\n\nUnderwood cut in. \"Speaking,\" he said irritably.\n\nThe voice of Terry Bernard burst into the room. \"Hey, Del! Are you\ngoing to get rid of that hangover and answer your phone or should we\nembalm the remains and ship 'em back?\"\n\n\"Terry! You fool, what do you want? Why didn't you say it was you? I\nthought maybe it was that elephant-foot Maynes, with chunks of mica\nthat he thought were prayer sticks.\"\n\n\"The Stroids didn't use prayer sticks.\"\n\n\"All right, skip it. What's new?\"\n\n\"Plenty. Can you come over for a while? I think we've really got\nsomething here.\"\n\n\"It'd better be good. We're taking the ship to Phyfe. Where are you?\"\n\n\"Asteroid C-428. It's about 2,000 miles from you. And bring all the\nhard-rock mining tools you've got. We can't get into this thing.\"\n\n\"Is _that_ all you want? Use your double coated drills.\"\n\n\"We wore five of them out. No scratches on the thing, even.\"\n\n\"Well, use the Atom Stream, then. It probably won't hurt the artifact.\"\n\n\"I'll say it won't. It won't even warm the thing up. Any other ideas?\"\n\nUnderwood's mind, which had been half occupied with mulling over his\npersonal problems while he talked with Terry, swung startledly to what\nthe archeologist was saying. \"You mean that you've found a material\nthe Atom Stream won't touch? That's impossible! The equations of the\nStream prove--\"\n\n\"I know. _Now_ will you come over?\"\n\n\"Why didn't you say so in the first place? I'll bring the whole ship.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUnderwood cut off and switched to the Captain's line. \"Captain Dawson?\nUnderwood. Will you please take the ship to the vicinity of Asteroid\nC-428 as quickly as possible?\"\n\n\"I thought Doctor Phyfe--\"\n\n\"I'll answer for it. Please move the vessel.\"\n\nCaptain Dawson acceded. His instructions were to place the ship at\nUnderwood's disposal.\n\nSoundlessly and invisibly, the distortion fields leaped into\nspace about the massive laboratory ship and the _Lavoisier_ moved\neffortlessly through the void. Its perfect inertia controls left no\nevidence of its motion apparent to the occupants with the exception of\nthe navigators and pilots. The hundreds of delicate pieces of equipment\nin Underwood's laboratories remained as steadfast as if anchored to\ntons of steel and concrete deep beneath the surface of Earth.\n\nTwenty minutes later they hove in sight of the small, black asteroid\nthat glistened in the faint light of the faraway Sun. The spacesuited\nfigures of Terry Bernard and his assistant, Batch Fagin, clung to the\nsurface, moving about like flies on a blackened, frozen apple.\n\nUnderwood was already in the scooter lock, astride the little\nspacescooter which they used for transportation between ships of the\nexpedition and between asteroids.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe pilot jockeyed the _Lavoisier_ as near as safely desirable, then\nsignaled Underwood. The physicist pressed the control that opened\nthe lock in the side of the vessel. The scooter shot out into space,\nbearing him astride it.\n\n\"Ride 'em, cowboy!\" Terry Bernard yelled into the intercom. He gave a\nwild cowboy yell that pierced Underwood's ears. \"Watch out that thing\ndoesn't turn turtle with you.\"\n\nUnderwood grinned to himself. He said, \"Your attitude convinces me of a\nlong held theory that archeology is no science. Anyway, if your story\nof a material impervious to the Atom Stream is wrong, you'd better get\na good alibi. Phyfe had some work he wanted to do aboard today.\"\n\n\"Come and see for yourself. This is it.\"\n\nAs the scooter approached closer to the asteroid, Underwood could\nglimpse the strangeness of the thing. It looked as if it had been\ncoated with the usual asteroid material of nickel iron debris, but\nTerry had cleared this away from more than half the surface.\n\nThe exposed half was a shining thing of ebony, whose planes and angles\nwere machined with mathematical exactness. It looked as if there were\nat least a thousand individual facets on the one hemisphere alone.\n\nAt the sight of it, Underwood could almost understand the thrill of\ndiscovery that impelled these archeologists to delve in the mysteries\nof space for lost kingdoms and races. This object which Terry had\ndiscovered was a magnificent artifact. He wondered how long it had\ncircled the Sun since the intelligence that formed it had died. He\nwished now that Terry had not used the Atom Stream, for that had\nprobably destroyed the validity of the radium-lead relationship in the\ncoating of debris that might otherwise indicate something of the age of\nthe thing.\n\nTerry sensed something of Underwood's awe in his silence as he\napproached. \"What do you think of it, Del?\"\n\n\"It's--beautiful,\" said Underwood. \"Have you any clue to what it is?\"\n\n\"Not a thing. No marks of any kind on it.\"\n\nThe scooter slowed as Del Underwood guided it near the surface of the\nasteroid. It touched gently and he unstrapped himself and stepped off.\n\"Phyfe will forgive all your sins for this,\" he said. \"Before you show\nme the Atom Stream is ineffective, let's break off a couple of tons of\nthe coating and put it in the ship. We may be able to date the thing\nyet. Almost all these asteroids have a small amount of radioactivity\nsomewhere in them. We can chip some from the opposite side where the\nAtom Stream would affect it least.\"\n\n\"Good idea,\" Terry agreed. \"I should have thought of that, but when\nI first found the single outcropping of machined metal, I figured it\nwas very small. After I found the Atom Stream wouldn't touch it, I was\noveranxious to undercover it. I didn't realize I'd have to burn away\nthe whole surface of the asteroid.\"\n\n\"We may as well finish the job and get it completely uncovered. I'll\nhave some of my men from the ship come on over.\"\n\nIt took the better part of an hour to chip and drill away samples to be\nused in a dating attempt. Then the intense fire of the Atom Stream was\nturned upon the remainder of the asteroid to clear it.\n\n\"We'd better be on the lookout for a soft spot.\" Terry suggested. \"It's\npossible this thing isn't homogeneous, and Papa Phyfe would be very\nmad if we burned it up after making such a find.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFrom behind his heavy shield which protected him from the stray\nradiation formed by the Atom Stream, Delmar Underwood watched the\nbiting fire cut between the gemlike artifact and the metallic alloys\nthat coated it. The alloys cracked and fell away in large chunks,\npropelled by the explosions of matter as the intense heat vaporized the\nmetal almost instantly.\n\nThe spell of the ancient and the unknown fell upon him and swept him up\nin the old mysteries and the unknown tongues. Trained in the precise\nmethods of the physical sciences, he had long fought against the\nfascination of the immense puzzles which the archeologists were trying\nto solve, but no man could long escape. In the quiet, starlit blackness\nthere rang the ancient memories of a planet vibrant with life, a\nplanet of strange tongues and unknown songs--a planet that had died\nso violently that space was yet strewn with its remains--so violently\nthat somewhere the echo of its death explosion must yet ring in the far\nvaults of space.\n\nUnderwood had always thought of archeologists as befogged antiquarians\npoking among ancient graves and rubbish heaps, but now he knew them\nfor what they were--poets in search of mysteries. The Bible-quoting of\nPhyfe and the swearing of red-headed Terry Bernard were merely thin\ndisguises for their poetic romanticism.\n\nUnderwood watched the white fire of the Atom Stream through the lead\nglass of the eye-protecting lenses. \"I talked to Illia today,\" he said.\n\"She says I've run away.\"\n\n\"Haven't you?\" Terry asked.\n\n\"I wouldn't call it that.\"\n\n\"It doesn't make much difference what you call it. I once lived in an\napartment underneath a French horn player who practised eight hours a\nday. I ran away. If the whole mess back on Earth is like a bunch of\nhorn blowers tootling above your apartment, I say move, and why make\nany fuss about it? I'd probably join the boys on Venus myself if my job\ndidn't keep me out here. Of course it's different with you. There's\nIllia to be convinced--along with your own conscience.\"\n\n\"She quotes Dreyer. He's one of your ideals, isn't he?\"\n\n\"No better semanticist ever lived,\" Terry said flatly. \"He takes the\nlong view, which is that everything will come out in the wash. I agree\nwith him, so why worry--knowing that the variants will iron themselves\nout, and nothing I can possibly do will be noticed or missed? Hence,\nI seldom worry about my obligations to mankind, as long as I stay\nreasonably law-abiding. Do likewise, Brother Del, and you'll live\nlonger, or at least more happily.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUnderwood grinned in the blinding glare of the Atom Stream. He wished\nlife were as simple as Terry would have him believe. Maybe it would be,\nhe thought--if it weren't for Illia.\n\nAs he moved his shield slowly forward behind the crumbling debris,\nUnderwood's mind returned to the question of who created the structure\nbeneath their feet, and to what alien purpose. Its black, impenetrable\nsurfaces spoke of excellent mechanical skill, and a high science that\ncould create a material refractory to the Atom Stream. Who, a half\nmillion years ago, could have created it?\n\nThe ancient pseudo-scientific Bode's Law had indicated a missing planet\nwhich could easily have fitted into the Solar System in the vicinity\nof the asteroid belt. But Bode's Law had never been accepted by\nastronomers--until interstellar archeology discovered the artifacts of\na civilization on many of the asteroids.\n\nThe monumental task of exploration had been undertaken more than a\ngeneration ago by the Smithson Institute. Though always handicapped by\nshortage of funds, they had managed to keep at least one ship in the\nfield as a permanent expedition.\n\nDr. Phyfe, leader of the present group, was probably the greatest\nstudent of asteroidal archeology in the System. The younger\narcheologists labeled him benevolently Papa Phyfe, in spite of the\nirascible temper which came, perhaps, from constantly switching his\nmind from half a million years ago to the present.\n\nIn their use of semantic correlations, Underwood was discovering, the\narcheologists were far ahead of the physical scientists, for they had\nan immensely greater task in deducing the mental concepts of alien\nraces from a few scraps of machinery and art.\n\nOf all the archeologists he had met, Underwood had taken the greatest\nliking to Terry Bernard. An extremely competent semanticist and\narcheologist, Terry nevertheless did not take himself too seriously. He\ndid not even mind Underwood's constant assertion that archeology was\nno science. He maintained that it was fun, and that was all that was\nnecessary.\n\nAt last, the two groups approached each other from opposite sides of\nthe asteroid and joined forces in shearing off the last of the debris.\nAs they shut off the fearful Atom Streams, the scientists turned to\nlook back at the thing they had cleared.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTerry said quietly, \"See why I'm an archeologist?\"\n\n\"I think I do--almost,\" Underwood answered.\n\nThe gemlike structure beneath their feet glistened like polished ebony.\nIt caught the distant stars in its thousand facets and cast them until\nit gleamed as if with infinite lights of its own.\n\nThe workmen, too, were caught in its spell, for they stood silently\ncontemplating the mystery of a people who had created such beauty.\n\nThe spell was broken at last by a movement across the heavens.\nUnderwood glanced up. \"Papa Phyfe's coming on the warpath. I'll bet\nhe's ready to trim my ears for taking the lab ship without his consent.\"\n\n\"You're boss of the lab ship, aren't you?\" said Terry.\n\n\"It's a rather flexible arrangement--in Phyfe's mind, at least. I'm\nboss until he decides he wants to do something.\"\n\nThe headquarters ship slowed to a halt and the lock opened, emitting\nthe fiery burst of a motor scooter which Doc Phyfe rode with angry\nabandon.\n\n\"You, Underwood!\" His voice came harshly through the phones. \"I demand\nan explanation of--\"\n\nThat was as far as he got, for he glimpsed the thing upon which the\nmen were standing, and from his vantage point it looked all the more\nlike a black jewel in the sky. He became instantly once more the eager\narcheologist instead of expedition administrator, a role he filled with\nirritation.\n\n\"What have you got there?\" he whispered.\n\nTerry answered. \"We don't know. I asked Dr. Underwood's assistance in\nuncovering the artifact. If it caused you any difficulty, I'm sorry;\nit's my fault.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Pah!\" said Phyfe. \"A thing like this is of utmost importance. You\nshould have notified me immediately.\"\n\nTerry and Underwood grinned at each other. Phyfe reprimanded every\narcheologist on the expedition for not notifying him immediately\nwhenever anything from the smallest machined fragment of metal to the\ngreatest stone monuments were found. If they had obeyed, he would have\ndone nothing but travel from asteroid to asteroid over hundreds of\nthousands of miles of space.\n\n\"You were busy with your own work,\" said Terry.\n\nBut Phyfe had landed, and as he dismounted from the scooter, he stood\nin awe. Terry, standing close to him, thought he saw tears in the old\nman's eyes through the helmet of the spaceship.\n\n\"It's beautiful!\" murmured Phyfe in worshipping awe. \"Wonderful. The\nmost magnificent find in a century of asteroidal archeology. We must\nmake arrangements for its transfer to Earth at once.\"\n\n\"If I may make a suggestion,\" said Terry, \"you recall that some of the\nartifacts have not survived so well. Decay in many instances has set\nin--\"\n\n\"Are you trying to tell me that this thing can decay?\" Phyfe's little\ngray Van Dyke trembled violently.\n\n\"I'm thinking of the thermal transfer. Doctor Underwood is better able\nto discuss that, but I should think that a mass of this kind, which is\nat absolute zero, might undergo unusual stresses in coming to Earth\nnormal temperatures. True, we used the Atom Stream on it, but that heat\ndid not penetrate enough to set up great internal stresses.\"\n\nPhyfe looked hesitant and turned to Underwood. \"What is your opinion?\"\n\nUnderwood didn't get it until he caught Terry's wink behind Phyfe's\nback. Once it left space and went into the museum laboratory, Terry\nmight never get to work on the thing again. That was the perpetual\ngripe of the field men.\n\n\"I think Doctor Bernard has a good point,\" said Underwood. \"I would\nadvise leaving the artifact here in space until a thorough examination\nhas been made. After all, we have every facility aboard the _Lavoisier_\nthat is available on Earth.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Phyfe. \"You may proceed in charge of the physical\nexamination of the find, Doctor Underwood. You, Doctor Bernard, will be\nin charge of proceedings from an archeological standpoint. Will that\nbe satisfactory to everyone concerned?\"\n\nIt was far more than Terry had expected.\n\n\"I will be on constant call,\" said Phyfe. \"Let me know immediately of\nany developments.\" Then the uncertain mask of the executive fell away\nfrom the face of the little old scientist and he regarded the find with\nhumility and awe. \"It's beautiful,\" he murmured again, \"_beautiful_.\"\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER TWO_\n\n\nPhyfe remained near the site as Underwood and Terry set their crew to\nthe routine task of weighing, measuring, and photographing the object,\nwhile Underwood considered what else to do.\n\n\"You know, this thing has got me stymied, Terry. Since it can't be\ntouched by an Atom Stream, that means there isn't a single analytical\nprocedure to which it will respond--that I know of, anyway. Does your\nknowledge of the Stroids and their ways of doing things suggest any\nidentification of it?\"\n\nTerry shook his head as he stood by the port of the laboratory ship\nwatching the crews at work outside. \"Not a thing, but that's no\ncriterion. We know so little about the Stroids that almost everything\nwe find has a function we never heard of before. And of course\nwe've found many objects with totally unknown functions. I've been\nthinking--what if this should turn out to be merely a natural gem\nfrom the interior of the planet, maybe formed at the time of its\ndestruction, but at least an entirely natural object rather than an\nartifact?\"\n\n\"It would be the largest crystal formation ever encountered, and\nthe most perfect. I'd say the chances of its natural formation are\nnegligible.\"\n\n\"But maybe this is the one in a hundred billion billion or whatever\nnumber chance it may be.\"\n\n\"If so, its value ought to be enough to balance the Terrestrial budget.\nI'm still convinced that it must be an artifact, though its material\nand use are beyond me. We can start with a radiation analysis. Perhaps\nit will respond in some way that will give us a clue.\"\n\nWhen the crew had finished the routine check, Underwood directed his\nmen to set up the various types of radiation equipment contained within\nthe ship. It was possible to generate radiation through almost the\ncomplete spectrum from single cycle sound waves to hard cosmic rays.\n\nThe work was arduous and detailed. Each radiator was slowly driven\nthrough its range, then removed and higher frequency equipment used. At\neach fraction of an octave, the object was carefully photographed to\nrecord its response.\n\nAfter watching the work for two days, Terry wearied of the seemingly\nnon-productive labor. \"I suppose you know what you're doing, Del,\" he\nsaid. \"But is it getting you anywhere at all?\"\n\nUnderwood shook his head. \"Here's the batch of photographs. You'll\nprobably want them to illustrate your report. The surfaces of the\nobject are mathematically exact to a thousandth of a millimeter.\nBelieve me, that's some tolerance on an object of this size. The\nsurfaces are of number fifteen smoothness, which means they are plane\nwithin a hundred-thousandth of a millimeter. The implications are\nobvious. The builders who constructed that were mechanical geniuses.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Did you get any radioactive dating?\"\n\n\"Rather doubtfully, but the indications are around half a million\nyears.\"\n\n\"That checks with what we know about the Stroids.\"\n\n\"It would appear that their culture is about on a par with our own.\"\n\n\"Personally, I think they were ahead of us,\" said Terry. \"And do you\nsee what that means to us archeologists? It's the first time in the\nhistory of the science that we've had to deal with the remains of a\ncivilization either equal or superior to our own. The problems are\nmultiplied a thousand times when you try to take a step up instead of a\nstep down.\"\n\n\"Any idea of what the Stroids looked like?\"\n\n\"We haven't found any bodies, skeletons, or even pictures, but we think\nthey were at least roughly anthropomorphic. They were farther from the\nSun than we, but it was younger then and probably gave them about the\nsame amount of heat. Their planet was larger and the Stroids appear\nto have been somewhat larger as individuals than we, judging from\nthe artifacts we've discovered. But they seem to have had a suitable\natmosphere of oxygen diluted with appropriate inert gases.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey were interrupted by the sudden appearance of a laboratory\ntechnician who brought in a dry photographic print still warm from the\ndeveloping box.\n\nHe laid it on the desk before Underwood. \"I thought you might be\ninterested in this.\"\n\nUnderwood and Terry glanced at it. The picture was of the huge,\ngemlike artifact, but a number of the facets seemed to be covered with\nintricate markings of short, wavy lines.\n\nUnderwood stared closer at the thing. \"What the devil are those? We\ntook pictures of every facet previously and there was nothing like\nthis. Get me an enlargement of these.\"\n\n\"I already have.\" The assistant laid another photo on the desk, showing\nthe pattern of markings as if at close range. They were clearly\ndiscernible now.\n\n\"What do you make of it?\" asked Underwood.\n\n\"I'd say it looked like writing,\" Terry said. \"But it's not like any\nof the other Stroid characters I've seen--which doesn't mean much, of\ncourse, because there could be thousands that I've never seen. Only how\ncome these characters are there now, and we never noticed them before?\"\n\n\"Let's go out and have a look,\" said Underwood. He grasped the\nphotograph and noted the numbers of the facets on which the characters\nappeared.\n\nIn a few moments the two men were speeding toward the surface of their\ndiscovery astride scooters. They jockeyed above the facets shown on the\nphotographs, and stared in vain.\n\n\"Something's the matter,\" said Terry. \"I don't see anything here.\"\n\n\"Let's go all the way around on the scooters. Those guys may have\nbungled the job of numbering the photos.\"\n\nThey began a slow circuit, making certain they glimpsed all the facets\nfrom a height of only ten feet.\n\n\"It's not here,\" Underwood agreed at last. \"Let's talk to the crew that\ntook the shots.\"\n\nThey headed towards the equipment platform, floating in free space,\nfrom which Mason, one of the Senior Physicists, was directing\noperations. Mason signaled for the radiations to be cut off as the men\napproached.\n\n\"Find any clues, Chief?\" he asked Underwood. \"We've done our best to\nfry this apple, but nothing happens.\"\n\n\"Something _did_ happen. Did you see it?\" Underwood extended the\nphotograph with the mechanical fingers of the spacesuit. Mason held it\nin a light and stared at it. \"We didn't see a thing like that. And we\ncouldn't have missed it.\" He turned to the members of the crew. \"Anyone\nsee this writing on the thing?\"\n\nThey looked at the picture and shook their heads.\n\n\"What were you shooting on it at the time?\"\n\nMason glanced at his records. \"About a hundred and fifty angstroms.\"\n\n\"So there must be something that becomes visible only in a field of\nradiation of about that wave length,\" said Underwood. \"Keep going and\nsee if anything else turns up, or if this proves to be permanent after\nexposure to that frequency.\"\n\nBack in the laboratory, they sat down at the desk and went through\nthe file of hundreds of photographs that were now pouring out of the\ndarkroom.\n\n\"Not a thing except that one,\" said Terry. \"It looks like a message\nintended only for someone who knew what frequency would make it\nvisible.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUnderwood shook his head. \"That sounds a little too melodramatic for\nme. Yet it is possible that this thing is some kind of repository, and\nwe've found the key to it. But what a key! It looks as if we've got to\ndecipher the language of the Stroids in order to use the key.\"\n\n\"The best men in the field have been trying to do that for only about\nseventy-five years. If that's what it takes, we may as well quit right\nnow.\"\n\n\"You said that this was nothing like any other Stroid characters that\nyou had seen. Maybe this belongs to a different cultural stratum. It\nmight prove easier to crack. Who's the best man in the field on this\nstuff?\"\n\n\"Dreyer at the semantics lab. He won't touch it any more. He says he's\nwasted fifteen years of his life on the Stroid inscriptions.\"\n\n\"I'll bet he will tackle this, if it's as new as you think it is. I've\nseen some of those antiquarians before. We'll get Phyfe to transmit\nsome copies of this to him. Who's the next best man?\"\n\n\"Probably Phyfe himself.\"\n\n\"It won't be hard to get him started on it, I'll bet.\"\n\nIt wasn't. The old scientist was ecstatic over the discovery of the\ninscriptions upon the huge gem. He took copies of the pictures into his\nstudy and spent two full days comparing them with the known records.\n\n\"It's an entirely new set of characters,\" he said after completing the\npreliminary examination. \"We already have three sets of characters that\nseem to be in no way related. This is the fourth.\"\n\n\"You sent copies to Dreyer?\"\n\n\"Only because you requested it. Dreyer admitted long ago that he was\nlicked.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDuring the week of Phyfe's study, the work of radiation analysis had\nbeen completed. It proved completely negative with the single exception\nof the 150 A. radiation which rendered visible the characters on the\ngem. No secondary effects of any significance whatever had been noted.\nThe material reflected almost completely nearly every frequency imposed\nupon it.\n\nThus, Underwood found himself again at the end of his resources. It\nwas impossible to analyze material that refused to react, which was\nrefractive to every force applied.\n\nUnderwood told Terry at the conclusion of a series of chemical tests,\n\"If you want to keep that thing out here any longer, I'm afraid\nyou've got to think of some more effective way of examining it than\nI have been able to do. From a physical standpoint this artifact is\nin about the same position as the language of the Stroids had been\nsemantically--completely intractable.\"\n\n\"I'm not afraid of its being sent back to the museum now. Papa Phyfe's\ngot his teeth into it and he won't let go until he cracks the key to\nthis lingo.\"\n\nUnderwood didn't believe that it would ever be solved, unless by\nsome lucky chance they came upon a sort of Rosetta Stone which would\nbridge the gap between the human mind and that of the alien Stroids.\nEven if the Stroids were somewhat anthropomorphic in makeup as the\narcheologists believed, there was no indication that their minds would\nnot be so utterly alien that no bridge would even be possible.\n\nUnderwood felt seriously inclined to abandon the problem. While\ncompletely fascinating, it was hardly more soluble than was the problem\nof the composition of the stars in the days before the spectroscope\nwas invented. Neither the archeologists, the semanticists, nor the\nphysicists yet had the tools to crack the problem of the Stroids. Until\nthe tools became available, the problem would simply have to go by the\nboards. The only exception was the remote possibility of a deliberate\nclue left by the Stroids themselves, but Underwood did not believe in\nmiracles.\n\nHis final conviction came when word came back from Dreyer, who said,\n\"Congratulations, Phyfe,\" and returned the copies of the Stroid\ncharacters with a short note.\n\n\"Well, that does it,\" said Underwood.\n\nPhyfe was dismayed by Dreyer's reply. \"The man's simply trying to\nuphold a decaying reputation by claiming the problem can't be solved.\nSend it to the museum and let them begin work on it. I'll give it my\nentire time. You will help me, if you will, Doctor Bernard.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTerry himself was becoming somewhat dismayed by the magnitude of the\nmystery they had uncovered. He knew Phyfe's bulldog tenacity when he\ntackled something and he didn't want to be tied to semantics for the\nrest of the term of the expedition.\n\nUnderwood, however, had become immersed in X-ray work, attempting\nto determine the molecular structure of the artifact from a\ncrystallographic standpoint, to find out if it could be found it might\nbe possible to disrupt the pattern.\n\nAfter he had been at it for about a week, Terry came into the lab in a\ndisgruntled mood at the completion of a work period.\n\n\"You look as if Papa gave you a spanking,\" said Underwood. \"Why the\ndowncast mood?\"\n\n\"I think I'll resign and go back to the museum. It's useless to work on\nthis puzzle any longer.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\n\"Because it doesn't follow the laws of semantics with respect to\nlanguage.\"\n\n\"Maybe the laws need changing.\"\n\n\"You know better than that. Look, you are as familiar with Carnovan's\nlaw as I am. It states that in any language there is bound to be a\ncertain constant frequency of semantic conceptions. It's like the\nold frequency laws that used to be used in cryptographic analysis\nexcept a thousand times more complex. Anyway, we've made thousands of\nsubstitutions into Carnovan's frequency scale and nothing comes out.\nNot a thing. No concept of ego, identity, perfection, retrogression, or\nintercourse shows up. The only thing that registers in the slightest\ndegree is the concept of motion, but it doesn't yield a single key\nword. It's almost as if it weren't even a language.\"\n\n\"Maybe it isn't.\"\n\n\"What else could it be?\"\n\n\"Well, maybe this thing we've found is a monument of some kind and\nthe inscriptions are ritualistic tributes to dead heroes or something.\nMaybe there's no trick at all about the radiation business. Maybe\nthey used that frequency for common illumination and the inscription\nwas arranged to show up just at night. The trouble with you strict\nsemanticists is that you don't use any imagination.\"\n\n\"Like to try a hand at a few sessions with Papa Phyfe?\"\n\n\"No, thanks, but I do think there are other possibilities that you\nare overlooking. I make no claim to being anything but a strictly ham\nsemanticist, but suppose, for example, that the inscriptions are not\nlanguage at all in the common sense.\"\n\n\"They must represent transfer of thought in some form.\"\n\n\"True, but look at the varied forms of thought. You are bound down to\nthe conception of language held as far back as Korzybski. At least to\nthe conception held by those who didn't fully understand Korzybski. You\nhaven't considered the concept of music. It's a very real possibility,\nbut one which would remain meaningless without the instrument. Consider\nalso--Wait a minute, Terry! We've all been a bunch of thoroughbred\ndopes!\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Look at the geometrical and mechanical perfection of the artifact.\nThat implies mathematical knowledge of a high order. The inscriptions\ncould be mathematical measurements of some kind. That would explain the\nbreakdown of Carnovan's principles. They don't apply to math.\"\n\n\"But what kind of math would be inscribed on a thing like that?\"\n\n\"Who knows? We can give it a try.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was the beginning of their sleeping period, but Terry was fired with\nUnderwood's sudden enthusiasm. He brought in a complete copy of all the\ninscriptions found upon the facets of the black gem. Underwood placed\nthem on a large table in continuous order as they appeared around the\ncircumference.\n\n\"It's mud to me,\" said Terry. \"I'm the world's worst mathematician.\"\n\n\"Look!\" exclaimed Underwood. \"Here's the beginning of it.\" He suddenly\nmoved some of the sheets so that one previously in the middle formed\nthe beginning of the sequence. \"What does it look like to you?\"\n\n\"I've seen that until I dream of it. It's one Phyfe tried to make the\nmost of in his frequency determinations. It looks like nothing more\nthan some widgets alongside a triangle.\"\n\n\"That's exactly what it is, and no wonder Phyfe found it had a high\nfrequency. That is nothing more nor less than an explanation of the\nStroid concept of the differential. This widget over here must be the\nsign of the derivative corresponding to our dy/dx.\"\n\nHastily, Underwood scrawled some symbols on a scratch pad, using\ncombinations of \"x\"s and \"y\"s and the strange, unknown symbols of the\nStroids.\n\n\"It checks. They're showing us how to differentiate! Not only that,\nwe have the key to their numerical system in the exponentials,\nbecause they've given us the differentiation of a whole series of\npower expressions here. Now, somewhere we ought to find an integral\nexpression which we could check back with differentiation. Here it is!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTerry, left behind now, went to the galley and brewed a steaming pot of\ncoffee and brought it back. He found Underwood staring unseeingly ahead\nof him into the dark, empty corners of the lab.\n\n\"What is it?\" Terry exclaimed. \"What have you found?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure. Do you know what the end product of all this math is?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"A set of wave equations, but such wave equations as any physicist\nwould be thought crazy to dream up. Yet, in light of some new\nmanipulations introduced by the Stroids, they seem feasible.\"\n\n\"What can we do with them?\"\n\n\"We can build a generator and see what kind of stuff comes out of\nit when we operate it according to this math. The Stroids obviously\nintended that someone find this and learn to produce the radiation\ndescribed. For what purpose we can only guess--but we might find out.\"\n\n\"Do we have enough equipment aboard to build such a generator?\"\n\n\"I think so. We could cannibalize enough from equipment we already have\non hand. Let's try it.\"\n\nTerry hesitated. \"I'm not quite sure, but--well, this stuff comes about\nas near as anything I ever saw to giving me what is commonly known as\nthe creeps. Somehow these Stroids seem too--too _anxious_. That sounds\ncrazy, I know, but there's such alienness here.\"\n\n\"Nuts. Let's build their generator and see what they're trying to tell\nus.\"\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER THREE_\n\n\nPhyfe was exuberant. He not only gave permission to construct the\ngenerator, he demanded that all work aboard the lab ship give priority\nto the new project.\n\nThe design of the machine was no easy task, for Underwood was a\nphysicist and not an engineer. However, he had two men, Moody and\nHansen, in his staff who were first rate engineers. On them fell\nthe chief burden of design after Underwood worked out the rough\nspecifications.\n\nOne of the main laboratories with nearly ten thousand square feet of\nfloor space was cleared for the project. As the specifications flowed\nfrom Underwood's desk, they passed over to Moody and Hansen, and from\nthere out to the lab where the mass of equipment was gathered from all\nparts of the fleet.\n\nAn atomic power supply sufficient to give the large amount of energy\nrequired by the generator was obtained by robbing the headquarters\nship of its auxiliary supply. Converter units were available in the\n_Lavoisier_ itself, but the main radiator tubes had to be cannibalized\nfrom the 150 A equipment aboard.\n\nSlowly the mass of improvised equipment grew. It would have been a\ndifficult task on Earth with all facilities available for such a\nproject, but with these makeshift arrangements it was a miracle that\nthe generator continued to develop. A score of times Underwood had to\nmake compromises that he hoped would not alter the characteristics of\nthe wave which, two weeks before, he would have declared impossible to\ngenerate.\n\nWhen the equipment was completed and ready for a trial check, the huge\nlab was a mass of hay-wiring into which no one but Moody and Hansen\ndared go.\n\nThe completion was an anti-climax. The great project that had almost\nhalted all other field work was finished--and no one knew what to\nexpect when Hansen threw the switch that fed power from the converters\ninto the giant tubes.\n\nAs a matter of fact, nothing happened. Only the faint whine of the\nconverters and the swinging needles of meters strung all over the room\nshowed that the beam was in operation.\n\nOn the nose of the _Lavoisier_ was the great, ungainly radiator a\nhundred feet in diameter, which was spraying the unknown depths of\nspace with the newly created power.\n\nUnderwood and Terry were outside the ship, behind the huge radiator,\nwith a mass of equipment designed to observe the effects of the beam.\n\nIn space it was totally invisible, creating no detectable field. It\nseemed as inactive as a beam of ultraviolet piercing the starlit\ndarkness.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUnderwood picked up the interphone that connected them with the\ninterior of the ship. \"Swing around, please, Captain Dawson. Let the\nbeam rotate through a one hundred and eighty degree arc.\"\n\nThe Captain ordered the ship around and the great _Lavoisier_ swung\non its own axis--but not in the direction Underwood had had in mind.\nHe failed to indicate the direction, and Dawson had assumed it didn't\nmatter.\n\nPonderously, the great radiator swung about before Underwood could\nshout a warning. And the beam came directly in line with the mysterious\ngem of the universe which they had found in the heart of the asteroid.\n\nAt once, the heavens were filled with intolerable light. Terry and\nUnderwood flung themselves down upon the hull of the ship and the\nphysicist screamed into the phones for Dawson to swing the other way.\n\nBut his warnings were in vain, for those within the ship were blinded\nby the great flare of light that penetrated even the protective ports\nof the ship. Irresistibly, the _Lavoisier_ continued to swing, spraying\nthe great gem with its mysterious radiation.\n\nThen it was past and the beam cut into space once more.\n\nOn top of the ship, Underwood and Terry found their sight slowly\nreturning. They had been saved the full blast of the light from the gem\nby the curve of the ship's hull which cut it off.\n\nUnderwood stumbled to his feet, followed by Terry. The two men stood\nin open-mouthed un-belief at the vision that met their eyes. Where the\ngem had drifted in space, there was now a blistered, boiling mass of\namorphous matter that surged and steamed in the void. All semblance to\nthe glistening, faceted, ebon gem was gone as the repulsive mass heaved\nwithin itself.\n\n\"It's destroyed!\" Terry exclaimed hoarsely. \"The greatest archeological\nfind of all time and we destroy it before we find out anything about\nit--\"\n\n\"Shut up!\" Underwood commanded harshly. He tried to concentrate on the\nhappenings before him, but he could find no meaning in it. He bemoaned\nthe fact that he had no camera, and only prayed that someone inside\nwould have the wit to turn one on.\n\nAs the ship continued its slow swing like a senseless animal, the\npulsing of the amorphous mass that had been the jewel slowly ceased.\nAnd out of the gray murkiness of it came a new quality. It began to\nregain rigidity--and transparency!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUnderwood gasped. At the boundary lines of the facets, heavy ribs\nshowed the tremendously reinforced structure that formed the skeleton.\nAnd each cell between the ribs was filled with thick substance that\npartially revealed the unknown world within.\n\nBut more than that, between one set of ribs he glimpsed what he was\nsure was an emptiness, a doorway to the interior!\n\n\"Come on,\" he called to Terry. \"Look at that opening!\"\n\nThey leaped astride the scooters clamped to the surface of the lab\nship and sped into space between the two objects. It required only an\ninstant to confirm his first hasty glimpse.\n\nThey navigated the scooters close to the opening and clamped them to\nthe surface. For a moment, Underwood thought the gem might be some\nstrange ship from far out of the Universe, for it seemed filled with\nmechanism of undescribable characteristics and unknown purposes. It was\nso filled that it was impossible to see very far into the interior even\nwith the help of the powerful lamps on the scooters.\n\n\"The beam was the key to get into the thing,\" said Terry. \"It was\nintended all along that the beam be turned on it. The beam had to be\nconnected with the gem in some way.\"\n\n\"And what a way!\"\n\nThe triangular opening was large enough to admit a man. Underwood and\nTerry knelt at the edge of it, peering down, flashing their lights\nabout the revealed interior. The opening seemed to drop into the center\nof a small room that was bare.\n\n\"Come into my parlor, said the spider to the fly,\" quoted Terry. \"I\ndon't see anything down there, do you?\"\n\n\"No. Why the spider recitation?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Everything is too pat. I feel as if someone is watching\nbehind us, practically breathing down our necks and urging us on the\nway he wants us to go. And when we get there we aren't going to like\nit.\"\n\n\"I suppose that is strictly a scientific hunch which we ignorant\nphysicists wouldn't understand.\"\n\nBut Terry was serious. The whole aspect of the Stroid device was\nunnerving in the way it led along from step to step, as if unseen\npowers were guiding them, rather than using their own initiative in\ntheir work.\n\nUnderwood gave a final grunt and dropped into the hole, flashing his\nlight rapidly about. Terry followed immediately. They found themselves\nin the center of a circular room twenty feet in diameter. The walls\nand the floor seemed to be of the same ebony-black material that had\ncomposed the outer shell of the gem before its transmutation.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe walls were literally covered from the floor to the ten-foot\nceiling with inscriptions that glowed faintly in the darkness when the\nflashlights were not turned on them.\n\n\"Recognize any of this stuff?\" asked Underwood.\n\n\"Stroid III,\" said Terry in awe. \"The most beautiful collection\nof engravings that have ever been found. We've never obtained a\nconsecutive piece even a fraction this size before. Dreyer has got to\ncome now.\"\n\n\"I've got a hunch about this,\" said Underwood slowly. \"I don't know a\nthing about the procedures used in deciphering an unknown lingo, but\nI'll bet you find that this is an instruction primer to their language,\njust as the inscriptions outside gave the key to their math before\ndetailing the wave equations.\"\n\n\"You might be right!\" Terry's eyes glowed with enthusiasm as he looked\nabout the polished walls with the faintly glowing characters inlaid in\nthem. \"If that's the case, Papa Phyfe and I ought to be able to do the\njob without Dreyer.\"\n\nThey returned to the ship for photographic equipment and to report\ntheir finding to Phyfe. It was a little difficult for him to adjust to\nthe view that something had been gained in the transformation of the\ngem. The sight of that boiling, amorphous mass in space had been to him\nlike helplessly standing on the bank of a stream and watching a loved\none drown.\n\nBut with Terry's report on the characters in Stroid III which lined the\nwalls of the antechamber which they had penetrated, he was ready to\nadmit that their position had improved.\n\nUnderwood was merely a by-stander as they returned to the gem. Two\nphotographers, Carson and Enright, accompanied them along with Nichols,\nassistant semanticist.\n\nUnderwood stood by, in the depths of speculation, as the photographers\nset up their equipment and Phyfe bent down to examine the characters at\nclose range.\n\nTerry continued to be dogged by the feeling that they were being led\nby the nose into something that would end unpleasantly. He didn't know\nwhy, except that the fact of immense and meticulous preparation was\nevidenced on all sides. It was the reason for that preparation which\nmade him wonder.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPhyfe said to Underwood, \"Doctor Bernard tells me your opinion is that\nthis room is a key to Stroid III. You may be right, but I fail to find\nany indication of it at present. What gives you that idea?\"\n\n\"The whole setup,\" said Underwood. \"First, there was the impenetrable\nshell. Nothing like it exists in Solarian culture today. Then there\nwas the means by which we were able to read the inscriptions on the\noutside. Obviously, if heat and fission reactions as well as chemical\nreactions could not touch the stuff, the only remaining means of\nanalysis was radiative. And the only peoples who could discover the\ninscriptions were those capable of building a generator of 150 A.\nradiations. We have there two highly technical requirements of anyone\nattempting to solve the secret of this cache--ability to generate the\nproper radiation, and the ability to understand their mathematics and\nbuild a second generator from their wave equations.\n\n\"Now that we're in here, there is nothing more we can do until we can\nunderstand their printed language. Obviously, they must teach it to us.\nThis would be the place.\"\n\n\"You may be right,\" said Phyfe, \"But we archeologists work with facts,\nnot guesses. We'll know soon enough if it's true.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUnderwood felt content to speculate while the others worked. There was\nnothing else for him to do. No way out of the anteroom was apparent,\nbut he was confident that a way to the interior would be found when the\ninscriptions were deciphered.\n\nHe went out to the surface and walked slowly about, peering into the\ntransparent depths with his light. What lay within this repository\nleft by an ancient race that had obviously equaled or surpassed man\nin scientific attainments? Would it be some vast store of knowledge\nthat would come to bless mankind with greater abundance? Or would it,\nrather, be a new Pandora's box, which would pour out upon the world new\nills to add to its already staggering burden?\n\nThe world had about all it could stand now, Underwood reflected. For a\ncentury, Earth's scientific production had boomed. Her factories had\nroared with the throb of incessant production, and the utopia of all\nthe planners of history was gradually coming to pass. Man's capacities\nfor production had steadily increased for five hundred years, and\nat last the capacities for consumption were rising equally, with\ncorrespondingly less time spent in production and greater time spent in\nconsumption.\n\nBut the utopia wasn't coming off just as the Utopians had dreamed of\nit. The ever present curse of enforced leisure was not respecting the\nnew age any more than it had past ages. Men were literally being driven\ncrazy with their super-abundance of luxury.\n\nOnly a year before, the so-called Howling Craze had swept cities\nand nations. It was a wave of hysteria that broke out in epidemic\nproportions. Thousands of people within a city would be stricken at\na time by insensate weeping and despair. One member of a household\nwould be afflicted and quickly it would spread from that man to the\nfamily, and from that family it would race the length and breadth of\nthe streets, up and down the city, until one vast cry as of a stricken\nanimal would assault the heavens.\n\nUnderwood had seen only one instance of the Howling Craze and he had\nfled from it as if pursued. It was impossible to describe its effects\nupon the nervous system--a whole city in the throes of hysteria.\n\nLife was cheap, as were the other luxuries of Earth. Murders by the\nthousands each month were scarcely noticed, and the possession of\nweapons for protection had become a mark of the new age, for no man\nknew when his neighbor might turn upon him.\n\nGovernments rose and fell swiftly and became little more than\nfigureheads to carry out the demands of peoples cloyed with the\nexcesses of life. Most significant of all, however, was the inability\nof any leader to hold any following for more than a short time.\n\nOf all the inhabitants of Earth, there were but a few hundred thousand\nscientists who were able to keep themselves on even keel, and most of\nthese were now fleeing.\n\nAs he thought of these things, Underwood pondered what the opening of\nthe repository of a people who sealed up their secrets half a million\nyears ago would mean to mankind. This must be what Terry felt, he\nthought.\n\nFor perhaps three hours he remained on the outside of the shell,\nletting his mind idle under the brilliance of the stars. Suddenly, the\nphones in his helmet came alive with sound. It was the voice of Terry\nBernard.\n\n\"We've got it, Del,\" he said quietly. \"We can read this stuff like\nnursery rhymes. Come on down. It tells us how to get into the thing.\"\n\nUnderwood did not hurry. He rose slowly from his sitting position and\nstared upward at the stars, the same stars that had looked down upon\nthe beings who had sealed up the repository. This is it, he thought.\nMan can never go back again.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe lowered himself into the opening.\n\nDoctor Phyfe was strangely quiet in spite of their quick success in\ndeciphering the language of the Stroids. Underwood wondered what was\ngoing through the old man's mind. Did he, too, sense the magnitude of\nthis moment?\n\nPhyfe said, \"They were semanticists as well. They knew Carnovan's\nfrequency. It's right here, the key they used to reveal their language.\nNo one less advanced in semantics than our own civilization could have\ndeciphered it, but with a knowledge of Carnovan's frequency, it is\nsimple.\"\n\n\"Practically hand-picked us for the job,\" said Terry.\n\nPhyfe's sharp eyes turned upon him suddenly behind the double\nprotection of his spectacles and the transparent helmet of the\nspacesuit.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Phyfe. \"Perhaps we are. At any rate, there are certain\nmanipulations to be performed which will open this chamber and provide\npassage to the interior.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Where's the door?\" said Underwood.\n\nFollowing the notes he had made, Terry moved about the room, directing\nUnderwood's attention to features of the design. Delicately carved,\nmovable levers formed an intricate combination that suddenly released\na section of the floor in the exact center of the room. It depressed\nslowly, then revolved out of the way.\n\nFor a moment no one spoke while Phyfe moved to the opening and peered\ndown. A stairway of the same glistening material as the walls about\nthem led downward into the depths of the repository.\n\nPhyfe stepped down and almost stumbled into the opening. \"Watch for\nthose steps,\" he warned. \"They're larger than necessary for human\nbeings.\"\n\n_Giants in those days_ came to Underwood's mind. He tried to vision the\ncreatures who had walked upon this stairway and touched the hand rail\nthat was shoulder high for him.\n\nThe repository was divided into levels and the stairway ended abruptly\nas they came to the level below the anteroom. The chamber in which\nthey found themselves was crowded with artifacts of strange shapes and\nvarying sizes. Not a thing of familiar cast greeted them. But opposite\nthe bottom of the stairway was a pedestal and upon it rested a booklike\nobject that proved to be hinged metallic sheets, covered with Stroid\nIII inscriptions, when Terry climbed up to examine it. He was unable\nto move it, but the metal pages were locked with a simple clasp that\nresponded to his touch.\n\n\"It looks as if we've got to read our way along,\" said Terry. \"I\nsuppose this will tell us how to get into the next room.\"\n\nUnderwood and the other expedition members moved cautiously about,\nexamining the contents of the room. The two photographers began to make\nan orderly pictorial record of everything within the chamber.\n\nStanding alone in one corner, Underwood peered at an object that\nappeared to be nothing but a series of opaque, polychrome globes\ntangent to each other and mounted on a pedestal.\n\nWhether it were some kind of machine or monument, he could not tell.\n\n\"You feel it, too,\" said a sudden quiet voice behind him. Underwood\nwhirled about in surprise. Phyfe was there behind him, his slight\nfigure a shapeless shadow in the spacesuit.\n\n\"Feel what?\"\n\n\"I've watched you, Doctor Underwood. You are a physicist and in\nfar closer touch with the real world than I. You have seen me--I\ncannot even manage an expedition with efficiency--my mind lives\nconstantly in the past, and I cannot comprehend the significance of\ncontemporary things. Tell me what it will mean, this intrusion\nof an alien science into our own.\"\n\nA sudden, new, and humbling respect filled Underwood. He had never\ndreamed that the little archeologist had such a penetrating view of\nhimself in his relation to his environment.\n\n\"I wish I could answer that question,\" said Underwood, shaking his\nhead. \"I can't. Perhaps if we knew, we'd destroy the thing--or it might\nbe that we'd shout our discovery to the Universe. But we can't know,\nand we wouldn't dare be the judges if we could. Whatever it is, the\nancient Stroids seem to have deliberately attempted to provide for the\nsurvival of their culture.\" He hesitated. \"That, of course is my guess.\"\n\nIn the darkened corner of the chamber, Phyfe nodded slowly. \"You are\nright, of course. It is the only answer. We dare not try to be the\njudges.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUnderwood saw that he would get nowhere in his understanding of\nthe Stroid science by merely depending on the translations given him\nby Terry and Phyfe. He'd have to learn to read the Stroid inscriptions\nhimself. He buttonholed Nichols and got the semanticist to show him the\nrudiments of the language. It was amazingly simple in principle and\nconstructed along semantic lines.\n\nThe going became rapidly heavier, however, and it took them the\nequivalent of five days to get through the fairly elementary material\ndisclosed in the first level below the antechamber.\n\nThe book of metal pages did little to satisfy their curiosity\nconcerning either the ancient planet or its culture. It instructed them\nfurther in understanding the language, and addressed them as Unknown\nfriends--the nearest human translation.\n\nAs was already apparent, the repository had been prepared to save the\nhighest products of the ancient Stroid culture from the destruction\nthat came upon the world. But the records did not even hint as to the\nnature of that destruction and they said nothing about the objects in\nthe room.\n\nThe scientists were a bit disappointed by the little revealed to them\nso far, but, as expected, there were instructions to enter the next\nlower level. There, an entirely different situation confronted them.\n\nThe chamber into which they came after winding down a long, spiral\nstairway, narrow, yet with the same high steps as before, was spherical\nin shape and seemed to be concentric with the outer shell of the\nrepository. It contained a single object.\n\nThe object was a cube in the center of the chamber, about two feet on\na side. From the corners of the cube, long supports of complicated\nspring structure led to the inner surface of the spherical chamber.\nIt appeared to be a highly effective shock mounting for whatever was\ncontained within the cube.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe sight before the men was impressive in simplicity, yet was\nanticlimactic, for there was nothing here of the great wonders that\nthey had expected. There was only the suspended cube--and a book.\n\nQuickly, Phyfe advanced along the narrow catwalk that led from the\nopening to the cube. The book lay on a shelf fastened to the side of\nthe cube. Phyfe opened it to the first sheet and read haltingly and\nlaboriously:\n\n\"Greetings, Unknown Friends, Greetings to you from the Great One. By\nthe token that you are now reading this, you have proven yourselves\nmentally capable of understanding the new world of knowledge and\ndiscovery that may be yours.\n\n\"I am Demarzule, the Great One the greatest of great Sirenia--and the\nlast. And within the storehouse of my mind is the vast knowledge that\nmade Sirenia the greatest world in all the Universe.\n\n\"Great as it was, however, destruction came to the world of Sirenia.\nBut her knowledge and her wonders shall never pass. In ages after, new\nworlds will rise and beings will inhabit them, and they will come to a\nminimum plane of knowledge that will assure their appreciation of the\nwonders that may be theirs from the world of Sirenia.\n\n\"You have minimum technical knowledge, else you could not have created\nthe radiation necessary to render the storehouse penetrable. You have a\nminimum semantic knowledge, else you could not have understood my words\nthat have brought you this far.\n\n\"You are fit and capable to behold the Great One of Sirenia!\"\n\nAs Phyfe turned over the first metal sheet, the men looked at each\nother. It was Nichols, the semanticist, who said, \"There are only two\npossibilities in a mind that would write a statement of that kind.\nEither it belonged to a truly superior being, or to a maniac. So far,\nin man's history, there has not been encountered such a superior being.\nIf he existed, it would have been wonderful to have known him.\"\n\nPhyfe paused and peered with difficulty through the helmet of the\nspacesuit. He continued, \"I live. I am eternal. I am in your midst,\nUnknown Friends, and to your hands falls the task of bringing speech to\nmy voice, and sight to my eyes, and feeling to my hands. Then, when you\nhave fulfilled your mighty task, you shall behold me and the greatness\nof the Great One of Sirenia.\"\n\nEnright, the photographer said, \"What the devil does that mean? The guy\nmust have been nuts. He sounds like he expected to come back to life.\"\n\nThe feeling within Underwood was more than bearable. It was composed\nof surging anticipation and quiet fearfulness, and they mingled in a\nraging torrent.\n\nThe men made no sound as Phyfe read on, \"I shall live again. The Great\nOne shall return, and you who are my Unknown Friends shall assist me to\nreturn to life. Then and only then shall you know the great secrets of\nthe world of Sirenia which are a thousand times greater than your own.\nOnly then shall you become mighty, with the secrets of Sirenia locked\nin my brain. By the powers I shall reveal, you shall become mighty\nuntil there are none greater in all the Universe.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPhyfe turned the page. Abruptly he stopped. He turned to Underwood.\n\"The rest of it is yours,\" he said.\n\n\"What--?\"\n\nUnderwood glanced at the page of inscription. With difficulty he took\nup the reading silently. The substance of the writings had changed and\nhere was a sudden wilderness of an alien science.\n\nSlowly he plodded through the first concepts, then skimmed as it became\nevident that here was material for days of study. But out of his hasty\nscanning there came a vision of a great dream, a dream of conquest of\nthe eons, the preservation of life while worlds waned and died and\nflared anew.\n\nIt told of an unknown radiation turned upon living cells, reducing them\nto primeval protoplasm, arresting all but the _symbol_ of metabolism.\n\nAnd it spoke of other radiation and complex chemical treatment, a\nfantastic process that could restore again the life that had been only\n_symbolized_ by the dormant protoplasm.\n\nUnderwood looked up. His eyes went from the featureless cube to the\nfaces of his companions.\n\n\"It's alive!\" he breathed. \"Five hundred million years--and it's alive!\nThese are instructions by which it may be restored!\"\n\nNone of the others spoke, but Underwood's eyes were as if a sudden,\ngreat commission had been placed upon him. Out of the turmoil of his\nthoughts a single purpose emerged, clear and irrevocable.\n\nWithin that cube lay dormant matter that could be formed into a\nbrain--an alien but mighty brain. Suddenly, Underwood felt an\nirrational kinship with the ancient creature who had so conquered time,\nand in his own mind he silently vowed that if it lay within his power,\nthat creature would live again, and speak its ancient secrets.\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER FOUR_\n\n\n\"Del!\" The shock of surprise and the flush of pleasure heightened the\nbeauty of Illia's delicate features. She stood in the doorway, the\naureole of her pale golden hair backlighted by the illumination from\nwithin the room.\n\n\"Surprised?\" said Underwood. He always found it difficult to speak for\na moment after the first sight of Illia. No one would guess a beauty\nlike her to be the top surgeon of Medical Center.\n\n\"Why didn't you let me know you were coming? It's not fair--\"\n\n\"--not to give you time to build up your defenses?\"\n\nShe nodded silently as he took her into his arms. But quickly she broke\naway and led him to the seat by the broad windows overlooking the night\nlights of the city below.\n\n\"Have you come back?\" she said.\n\n\"Back? You put such a confusing amount of meaning into ordinary words,\nIllia.\"\n\nShe smiled and sat down beside him, and swiftly changed the subject.\n\"Tell me about the expedition. Archeology has always seemed the most\nfutile of all sciences, but I've supposed that was because I could find\nnothing in common between it and my medical science, nothing in common\nwith the future. I've wondered what a physicist could find in it.\"\n\n\"I think you'll find something in common with our latest discovery. We\nhave a living though dormant creature on an equal or superior plane of\nintelligence with us. Its age is around half a million years. You will\nbe interested in the medical aspects of that, I am sure.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor a moment Illia sat as if she hadn't heard him. Then she said, \"That\ncould be a discovery to change a world, if you're sure of what you've\nfound.\"\n\nUnderwood felt irritation more because he had been trying to fight down\nthe same idea himself than because she had spoken it. \"Your semantic\nextensions would turn Phyfe's whiskers white. We haven't found any such\nworld-shaking discovery. We've found a creature out of another age and\nanother culture, but it's not going to disrupt or change our society.\"\n\n\"If it's a scientifically superior culture, how do you know what it\nwill do?\"\n\n\"We don't, but to apply so many extensions only confuses our\ninterpretation more. I mention it because we are going to need a\nbiological advisor. I thought you might like to be it.\"\n\nHer eyes were staring far out across the halo of the city's lights. She\nsaid, \"Del, is it human?\"\n\n\"Human? What's human? Is intelligence human? Can any other factor of\nour existence be defined as human? If you can tell me that, perhaps I\ncan answer. So far, we only know that it is a sentient creature of high\nscientific culture.\"\n\n\"Then that alone makes its relationship with us a sympathetic one?\"\n\n\"Why, I suppose so. I see no reason why not.\"\n\n\"Yes. Yes, I agree with you! And don't you see? It can be a germ\nof rejuvenation, a nucleus to gather the scattered impulses of our\nculture and unify them in an absorption of this new science. Look\nwhat biological knowledge the mere evidence of suspended animation\nindicates.\"\n\n\"All right.\" Underwood laughed faintly in resignation. \"There's no use\ntrying to avoid such a discussion with you, is there, Illia? You'd take\nthe first flower of spring and project a whole summer's glory from it,\nwouldn't you?\"\n\n\"But am I wrong in this? The people of Earth need _something_ to cement\nthem together in this period of disillusionment. This could be it.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Underwood. \"We talked it over out there before we\ndecided to go ahead with the restoration. We talked and argued for\nhours. Some of the men wanted to destroy the thing immediately because\nit is impossible to forecast the effect of this discovery from a\nstrictly semantic standpoint. We have no data.\n\n\"Terry Bernard definitely fought for its destruction. Phyfe is afraid\nof the possible consequences, but he maintains that we haven't the\nright to destroy it because it is too great a heritage. I maintain\nthat from a purely scientific standpoint we have no right to consider\nanything but restoration, regardless of consequences.\n\n\"And there is something more--the personal element. A creature whose\nimagination and daring were great enough to preserve his ego through an\nage of five hundred thousand years deserves something more than summary\nexecution. He deserves the right to be known and heard. Actually, it\nseems ridiculous to fear anything that can come of this. Well, Phyfe\nand Terry are expert semanticists, and they're afraid--\"\n\n\"Oh, they're wrong, Del! They _must_ be wrong. If they have no data,\nif they have only a hunch, a prejudice, it's ridiculous for them as\nscientists to be swayed by such feelings.\"\n\n\"I don't know. I wash my hands of all such aspects of the problem.\nI only know that I'm going to see that a guy who's got the brains\nand guts this one must have had has his chance to be heard. So far,\nI'm on the winning side. Tomorrow I'm going to see Boarder and the\nDirector's Committee with Phyfe. If you're interested in taking the job\nI mentioned, come along.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe enthusiasm of the directors was even greater than that of Illia,\nif possible. None of them seemed to share the fears of some of the\nexpedition members. And, somehow, in the warm familiarity of the\ncommittee room, those fears seemed fantastically groundless. Boarder,\nthe elder member of the committee of directors, could not hold back\nhis tears as he finished the report and Underwood had given verbal\namplification.\n\n\"What a wonderful thing that this should have happened in our\nlifetime,\" he said. \"Do you think it is feasible? The thing seems\nso--so fantastic, the restoration of a living creature of half a\nmillion years ago.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I don't know the answer to that,\" said Underwood. \"No one\ndoes. The construction of the equipment described by the Stroid,\nthough, is completely within range of our technical knowledge. I'm\ncertain that we can set it up exactly according to specifications. It\nis possible that too much time has passed and the protoplasm has died.\nIt is possible that Demarzule thought in terms of hundreds of years,\nor, at the most, a few thousand, before he would be found. There is\nno way to know except to construct the equipment and carry out the\nexperiment, which I will do if the Directors wish to authorize the\nexpenditure.\"\n\n\"There is no question of that!\" said Boarder. \"We'd mortgage the entire\nInstitution if necessary! I'm wondering what laboratory space we can\nuse. Why not put it in the new Carlson Museum building? The specimens\nfor the Carlson can stay in the warehouse for a while longer.\"\n\nBoarder looked about the circle of Directors facing him. He saw nods\nand called for a vote. His proposal was upheld.\n\nWith approval given, Phyfe returned to the expedition to supervise\nthe transfer of the repository of Demarzule to Earth, while Underwood\nbegan infinitely detailed planning for the construction and setup of\nequipment as specified by the instructions he had brought from the\nStroid repository.\n\nThe great semanticist, Dreyer, was asked to help in a consulting\ncapacity for the whole project; specifically, to assist in\nretranslation of the records to make absolutely certain of their\ninterpretation of the scientific instructions.\n\nDreyer was a short, squat man who had never been caught without a thick\nblack cigar from which billowed endless columns of pale blue smoke. His\nface was round and baby-calm. He gave the impression of having achieved\nthe impossible goal of complete serenity in a world that swirled with\nunceasing turmoil.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe listened quietly when approached, and when Phyfe and Underwood had\nfinished their stories, he said, \"Yes, I shall be glad to help. This is\na thing of great importance.\"\n\nBut Underwood was forced to shed his mind of sociological and semantic\nimplications of the job they were doing. The technical work involved\nwas of tremendous complexity and magnitude. A mountainous quantity of\ncomplicated equipment had to be designed and built, but as Underwood\ndeciphered the instructions of the Stroids and had it verified by\nDreyer, he could find no short cuts, nor did he dare attempt any.\n\nThe Carlson Museum had been designed along the lines of an ancient\nGreek temple and was set prominently on a low hill apart from other\ngroups of buildings of the Smithson. Its glistening marble columns\nmade a landmark for miles. It was rather symbolical in a way, Underwood\nthought, that such an imposing edifice should be appointed for the\nresurrection of the ancient Great One.\n\nThe central hall of the museum was cleared of display cases which had\nalready been set up. Electronic and biological equipment began to flow\nin as Underwood sent strange fabrication orders to scattered shops and\nplants throughout the country.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen it was announced that the Carlson would not open on the date\npreviously set, the worldwide news associations were interested and\nUnderwood was suddenly besieged by reporters. He briefly outlined their\ndiscovery. It would make some good science supplement yarns, Underwood\nsupposed, and by the time the reporters got through with the stories\nthey would have a whole race of monsters out of space being restored in\nthe Carlson.\n\nUnderwood told them as much.\n\nBut Davis of the Science Press shook his head. \"No, that's not the\nangle. Archeology always makes good stories, but this is the first\ntime archeology has ever produced any live specimens. We'll build the\ncreature up big from the sympathetic angle. What did you say the\ninscriptions called him? The Great One?\"\n\nUnderwood nodded.\n\n\"That's it! The mysterious, all knowing brain that has lain dormant in\nthe void for ages, waiting for the touch of a merciful hand to restore\nlife to that mighty intellect and receive in payment the magnificent\nstore of knowledge locked within it. That's the angle we'll use.\"\n\nUnderwood mentally gagged and returned to his work.\n\nSlowly the equipment took shape within the large hall. The center\nof construction was the ceramic bath which would hold the mass\nof protoplasm in its nutrient solution and keep it in controlled\ntemperatures and pressures. The complex observation panel was being\nassembled beside it. From this point every physiological function\nof the developing mass could be observed as it progressed. Scores\nof meters would give electronic readings which could be interpreted\nin terms of developing functions. It was almost like watching the\ndevelopment and growth of a foetus, for that appeared almost to be the\ncourse of growth that was to be expected.\n\nAutomatic valves would control the injection into the bath of nutrient\nmaterials with an accuracy of a thousandth of a milligram. A dozen\noperators would be trained, were now being selected, for the precise\ntask of watching the bath during every second of the growth of the\norganism.\n\nThe upper half of the walls of the bath was transparent, as was the\ncover. Inside, under the cover, the broad reflecting cone of the\nradiator would spray the long dormant protoplasm with life-giving\nradiation. Giant generators required to provide this radiation filled\nother parts of the hall.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was five months after the actual discovery of the repository that\nthe restoration equipment was completed and tested and ready for use.\nPublic interest in the project had been aroused by the sensational news\nreports, and a constant stream of people passed the Carlson to glimpse\nthe activities going on inside.\n\nThe news stories built up the Stroid as the magnificent benefactor of\nmankind, as Davis had promised. They presented a sympathetic aspect\nof a creature imprisoned and doomed throughout the ages, and now\nbeing released from bondage and ready to pour out blessings upon his\nbenefactors.\n\nUnderwood didn't pay much attention to the news stories, but the\nincreasing swarms of people began to get in his way and hampered\noperations. He was forced to ask the directors to fence off a large\narea about the Carlson.\n\nDuring this time the _Lavoisier_ had been slowly swinging in an orbit\nabout the Earth to keep the repository, taken bodily into its hold, at\nthe temperature of space, until time for the transfer of the protoplasm\nto the nutrient bath.\n\nNow, with everything completed at the Museum, Underwood and Phyfe\nreturned to the repository to direct the removal of the container\nof protoplasm, leaving Terry Bernard in charge at the museum. The\noperators and technicians were ready to take over their duties.\n\nRemoval of the protoplasm to Earth was a critical operation. The bath\nat the Carlson had been brought down to absolute zero and would be\nbrought up a few degrees at a time.\n\nBoarder and the other directors of the Institution did not share\nUnderwood's reluctance for publicity. They were accustomed to the ways\nof the publicity writers, for much of the income of the Institute\ndepended upon such publicity which drew substantial contributions.\n\nSo it was that the arrival of the _Lavoisier_ was widely announced. A\ncrowd of ten thousand gathered to watch the removal of the protoplasm\nthat had once been a great and alien being.\n\nUnderwood stood in the control room watching the landing area beside\nthe Carlson as the ship settled deep into Earth's atmosphere. Gradually\nhe made out the identity of the black smear covering the landscape\nabout the white stone building that gleamed like a Grecian temple.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTerry, beside him, exclaimed, \"Look at that mob! The whole town must be\nout to welcome our guest.\"\n\n\"If they don't get out of the landing area, they'll be smeared over the\nlandscape. Collins, contact the base and get that field cleared!\"\n\nThe communications officer put the call in. The laboratory ship circled\nidly while the mob moved slowly back to permit the ship to touch down\nbeside the building.\n\nUnderwood raced out of the ship and into the building. His technicians\nwere standing by. Each one in turn reported his position operating\nproperly. Then Underwood called back to the ship and ordered the\nportable lock released.\n\nAt once the massive cargo hold was thrown open and the thick-walled\nlock, bearing the container of protoplasm, was wheeled out.\n\nThe crowd caught sight of it as it rolled swiftly into the building.\nSomeone in the far ranks sent up a cry. \"Hail the Great One! Welcome\nto Earth!\"\n\nThe shout was taken up by hundreds, then thousands of throats until\na sea of sound washed against the ears of those within the building.\nUnderwood paused and turned to look out as the sound caught him. A\nfaint chill went through him.\n\n\"The fools,\" he said angrily to Terry. \"They'll drive themselves into\nhysteria if they keep that up. Why didn't the directors keep this whole\nbusiness quiet? They ought to have known how it would affect a mob of\nbystanders.\"\n\nFrom a distance, Illia and Dreyer watched silently. Underwood hurried\naway to give attention to the cargo. The lock was wheeled close to\nthe bath and a passage was opened as the two containers were brought\nadjacent. On sterile slides, the frozen protoplasmic mass slid forward\nand came to rest at last within the machine for which it had waited\nhalf a million years.\n\nThere was utter lack of response to that final placement of the mass.\nYet those who watched knew that the great experiment had begun. In six\nmonths, they would find out if they were successful.\n\nUnderwood sent the carriage back to the ship, and the _Lavoisier_\nmoved to the Institute's spaceport. Then Boarder entered with a score\nof photographers and newsmen in his wake. They took pictures of the\nequipment and technicians, and of the protoplasm lying inert within the\nbath, in which the nutrient liquids would be placed after a temperature\nof a hundred degrees had been reached.\n\nUnderwood did not have time to pay any attention to the newsmen. He\ntried to be everywhere at once, inspecting meters and gauges, assuring\nhimself that all was functioning well. Every piece of equipment was\ntriply installed for safety in case of breakdown. The instructions\nwarned that, once started, the process of restoration must not be\ninterrupted or death to the Great One would result.\n\nWhen he had finished his inspection, Underwood felt suddenly exhausted.\nHe turned away to avoid the newsmen whom Boarder was now lecturing on\nthe subject of the strange repository in space and its even stranger\ninhabitant.\n\nUnderwood spied the aged figure standing almost unseen near the recess\nbetween two panels. It was Phyfe and he spoke slowly as Underwood\napproached.\n\n\"It is begun,\" the old archeologist said slowly. \"And it can never be\nundone.\"\n\nUnderwood felt again that chill of apprehension and looked sharply at\nPhyfe, but the latter was staring straight ahead--straight at the inert\nblock of protoplasm.\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER FIVE_\n\n\nPhyfe asked to be relieved of his duties as head of the expedition\nstill in the field in order that he might devote his entire time to\na study of Stroid records and manuscripts now in existence. Terry\nBernard gave up field work to assist him in order to be near the site\nof restoration. With them was Dreyer, who attacked with feverish effort\nthe translation of the language that had defied him so long.\n\nUnderwood was concerned with the resurrection itself. He sensed that\nthe very secret of life was involved in the work he was doing. The\ninstruction book left by the Stroid was in the nature of an operating\nmanual, however, rather than a theoretical text, and now that the\nexperiment was actually under way, Underwood abandoned everything in an\nattempt to study fully the processes that were taking place.\n\nSo occupied were they with their own studies that the scientists\nscarcely noticed the public reaction to the creature they were\nattempting to restore.\n\nThe first outward sign had been that wild cry of welcome the day the\nprotoplasm was brought to Earth.\n\nThe next was the Sunday sermon preached by one of the multitude of\nobscure religious leaders in a poorly attended meeting in a luxurious\nchurch in that same city.\n\nWilliam B. Hennessey had been a publicity man in his early years\nbefore the full breakdown began to show, and he was conscious of good\npublicity values. But perhaps he half believed what he wrote and the\nmere preaching of it convinced him it was so. It is probable that there\nwere other preachers who took the same theme that Sunday morning, but\nWilliam B. Hennessey's was the one that got the news publicity.\n\nHe said, \"How many of this congregation this morning are among those\nwho have given up in the race of life, who have despaired of values\nand standards to cling to, who have forsaken the leadership of all who\nwould lead you? Perhaps you are among the millions of those who have\ngiven up all hope of solving the great problems of life. If you are,\nI want to ask if you were among those who witnessed the miraculous\narrival of the Gift out of the Ages. Were you among those who saw the\nGreat One?\"\n\nWilliam B. Hennessey paused. \"For centuries we have looked for\nleadership in our own midst and not found it. They were, after all,\nmerely human. But now, into the hands of our noble scientists, has been\nimparted the great task of awakening the sleeping Great One, and when\nthey have completed their work, the Golden Age of Earth will be upon us.\n\n\"I call upon you to throw off the shackles of despair. Come out of the\nprison of your disillusionment. Make ready to greet the Great One on\nthe day of his rising. Let your hearts and minds be ready to receive\nthe message that he shall give, and to obey the words of counsel you\nshall surely be given, for truly from a greater world and a brighter\nland than ours has come the Great One to preserve us!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWithin an hour Hennessey's words were flashed around the world.\n\nTerry was the only one of the scientists on the project who heard about\nit. He went over to the museum in the afternoon and found Underwood and\nDreyer at the test board.\n\n\"Some crackpot preacher this morning gave out a sermon on Oscar here.\"\nHe jerked a thumb toward the bath. \"He says we've got the solution to\nall the world's ills. He's calling on the people to worship Oscar.\"\n\n\"You might know some fool thing like that would happen.\"\n\nDreyer emitted a single, explosive puff of cigar smoke. \"A religious\ncult based upon this alien intelligence. We should have predicted that\ndevelopment. I wonder why our computations failed to indicate it.\"\n\n\"I think it's dangerous,\" said Terry. \"It could turn into serious\nbusiness.\"\n\n\"What do you mean? I don't get it,\" said Underwood.\n\n\"Don't you see the implications? The whole trouble with our culture\nis disillusionment, lack of leadership. If this thing turns out to be\nsentient, intelligent--even superior--why, it could become anything the\npeople wanted to make it, president, dictator, god, or what not.\"\n\n\"Oh, take it easy,\" Underwood said. \"This is just one little tin-horn\npreacher who probably didn't have more than a hundred in his\ncongregation. The news broadcasts must have treated it as a humorous\ncommentary on our experiments. Just the same, we should never have\nallowed the news to be broadcast. It all started with that hysterical\nmob the day we brought the protoplasm here.\"\n\nDreyer shook his head amid the smoke aura. \"No. It began long ago when\nthe first cave man plastered up his clay gods and found them cracked\nin the Sun and washed away with the rains. It began when the first cave\nchieftain was slain by a rival leader and his disillusioned followers\nlooked about for a new head man. It has been going on ever since.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"It's no concern of ours,\" said Underwood.\n\nDreyer went on slowly, \"As one by one the gods and chieftains fell, men\ncast about for new leaders who would bear the burdens of mankind and\nshow the way to that illusive paradise that all men sought. Through the\nages there have always been those who would let themselves be lifted up\nand called great, who would undertake to lead. Some had their eyes on\nfaraway starry places that man could never reach and their disciples\nfell away, heartbroken and discouraged. Others sought their goal by\nmastery over foreign men and nations and bathed their followers in\nblood and disaster. But always their star fell and men never found the\nelusive goal which they could not name nor define.\"\n\n\"And so the Age of Disillusion,\" said Underwood bitterly.\n\n\"But disillusion is a healthy thing. It leads to reality.\"\n\n\"How can you call this healthy?\" Underwood demanded. \"Men believe in\nnothing. They have lost faith in life itself.\"\n\n\"Faith in life? I wonder what that means,\" said Dreyer, musingly.\n\"Watch your extensions, Dr. Underwood.\"\n\nUnderwood flushed, recalling Illia's remark that Dreyer would tear off\nevery other word and throw it back at him. \"All right, then. There are\nno governments, no leaders, no religions to lean upon in times of need,\nbecause men have no confidence in such sources.\"\n\n\"All of which is a sign that they are approaching a stage in which they\nwill no longer need such support. And, like a baby in his first steps,\nthey stumble and fall. They get bruised and cry, as I detect that many\nof our scientists have done, else they would not have run away to Venus\nand other places.\"\n\nUnderwood blinked from the sting of Dreyer's rebuke. \"That's the second\ntime I've been accused of running away,\" he said.\n\n\"No offense,\" Dreyer said. \"I am merely stating facts. That you do\nnot believe them is not to your condemnation, only a commentary on\nthe state of your knowledge. But our discussion is on the restoration\nof the alien, and your knowledge may have far-reaching effects in the\ndisposition of this project.\"\n\n\"Policy is controlled by the directors, who will be guided by your\nrecommendations--\"\n\nDreyer shook his head. \"No, I think not, unless it pleases them. Should\nI ever recommend destruction of the alien, I would have to work through\nyou. And that would take much convincing, would it not?\"\n\n\"Plenty,\" said Underwood. \"Are you recommending that now?\"\n\n\"Not yet. No, not yet.\"\n\nSlowly, Dreyer moved away toward the massive bath that housed the\nalien, Demarzule, Hetrarra of Sirenia, the Great One.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUnderwood watching the beetle-back of the semanticist felt deflated by\nthe encounter. Dreyer seemed always so nerve-rackingly calm. Underwood\nwondered if it were possible to acquire such immunity to turmoil.\n\nHe turned back to Terry, who had stood in silent agreement with Dreyer.\n\"How are you and Phyfe coming along?\"\n\n\"It's a slow business, even with the help of the key in the repository.\nThat was apparently pure Stroid III, but we have two other languages or\ndialects that are quite different and we seem to have more specimens\nof those than we do of Stroid III. Phyfe thinks he's on the way to\ncracking both Stroid I and II, though. Personally, I'd like to get\nback out to the asteroids, if it weren't for Demarzule. I wasn't meant\nto be a scholar.\"\n\n\"Stick with it. I'm hoping that we can have some kind of idea what the\nStroid civilization was like by the time Demarzule revives.\"\n\n\"How is it coming?\"\n\n\"Cell formation is taking place, but how organs will ever develop\nis more than I can see. We're just waiting and observing. Four\nmotion picture cameras are constantly at work, some through electron\nmicroscopes. At the end of six months we'll at least have a record of\nwhat occurred, regardless of what it is.\"\n\nThe mass of life grew and multiplied its millions of cells. Meanwhile,\nanother growth, less tangible but no less real, was swiftly rising and\nspreading through the Earth. The mind of each man it encompassed was\none of its cells, and they were multiplying no less rapidly than those\nof the growth within the marble museum building. The leadership of men\nby men had proven false beyond all hope of ever restoring the dream of\na mortal man who could raise his fellows to the heights of the stars.\nBut the Great One was something else again. Utterly beyond all Earthly\nbuild and untainted with the flaws of Earthmen, he was the gift of the\ngods to man--he _was_ a god who would lift man to the eternal heights\nof which he had dreamed.\n\nThe flame spread and leaped the oceans of Earth. It swept up all creeds\nand races and colors.\n\nDelmar Underwood looked up from his desk in annoyance as a pompous,\nred-faced man of short, stout build was ushered in by his secretary.\nThe man halted halfway between the door and the desk and bowed slightly.\n\nHe said, \"I address the Prophet Underwood by special commission of the\nDisciples.\"\n\n\"What the devil--?\" Underwood frowned and extended a hand toward a\nbutton. But he didn't ring. The visitor extended an envelope.\n\n\"And by special authorization of Director Boarder of the Institute!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nStill keeping his eyes on the man, Underwood accepted the envelope and\nripped it open. In formal language and the customary red tape manner,\nit instructed Underwood to hear the visitor, one William B. Hennessey,\nand grant the request that Hennessey would make.\n\nUnderwood knew him now. His throat felt suddenly dry. \"What's this all\nabout?\"\n\nThe man shrugged disparagingly. \"I am only a poor Disciple of the Great\nOne, who has been commissioned by his fellows to seek a favor at the\nhands of the Prophet Underwood.\"\n\nAs Underwood looked into the man's eyes, he felt a chill, and a wave of\napprehension swept over him with staggering force.\n\n\"Sit down,\" he said. \"What is it you want?\" He wished Dreyer were here\nto place some semantic evaluation upon this crazy incident.\n\n\"The Disciples of the Great One would have the privilege of viewing the\nMaster,\" said Hennessey as he sat down near the desk. \"You scientists\nare instruments selected for a great task. The Great One did not come\nonly to a select few. He came to all mankind. We request the right to\nvisit the temple quietly and view the magnificent work you are doing\nas you restore our Master to life so that we may receive of his great\ngifts.\"\n\nUnderwood could picture the laboratory filled with bowing, praying,\nyelling, fanatic worshippers crowding around, destroying equipment and\nprobably trying to walk off with bits of holy protoplasm. He pressed\na switch and spun a dial savagely. In a moment the face of Director\nBoarder was on the tiny screen before him.\n\n\"This fanatic Hennessey is here. I just wanted to check on the possible\nliability before having him thrown out on his ear.\"\n\nBoarder's face grew frantic. \"Don't do that! You got my note? Do\nexactly as I said. Those are orders!\"\n\n\"But we can't carry on an experiment with a bunch of fanatics yapping\nat our heels.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I don't care how you do it. You've got to give them what they want.\nEither that or fold up the experiment. The latest semi-weekly poll\nshows they effectively control eighty million votes. You know what that\nmeans. One word to the Congressional scientific committee and all of us\nwould be out on our ear.\"\n\n\"We could shut the thing up and call it off. The protoplasm would just\nquietly die and then what would these birds have to worship?\"\n\n\"Destruction of government property _can_ carry the death penalty,\"\nsaid Boarder ominously. \"Besides, you're too much of the scientist to\ndo that. You want to see the thing through just as much as the rest of\nus do. If I had the slightest fear that you'd destroy it, I'd yank you\nout of there before you knew where you were--but I haven't any such\nfears.\"\n\n\"Yes, you're right, but these--\" Underwood made a grimace as if he were\ntrying to swallow an oyster with fur on.\n\n\"I know. We've got to put up with it. The scientist who survives in\nthis day and age is the one who adjusts to his environment.\" Boarder\ngrinned sourly.\n\n\"I went out to space to escape the environment. Now I'm right back in\nit, only worse than ever.\"\n\n\"Well, look, Underwood, why can't you just build a sort of balcony with\na ramp running across the lab so that these Disciples of the Great One\ncan look down into the bath? You could feed them in at one end of the\nbuilding and run them out the other. That way it wouldn't upset you.\nAfter all, it's only going to last six months.\"\n\n\"When the Stroid revives, they'll probably want to put him on a throne\nwith a radiant halo about his head.\" Boarder laughed. \"If he represents\nthe civilization whose artifacts we've found on the asteroids, I think\nhe'll take care of his 'Disciples' in short order. Anyway, you'll have\nto do as they demand. It won't last long.\"\n\nBoarder cut off and Underwood turned back to the bland Hennessey, who\nsat as if nothing would ever disturb him.\n\n\"You see,\" Hennessey said, \"I knew what the outcome would be. I had\nfaith in the Great One.\"\n\n\"Faith! You knew that the scientific committee would back you up\nbecause you represent eighty million neurotic crackpots. What will you\ndo when your Great One wakes up and tells you all to go to hell?\"\n\nHennessey smiled quietly. \"He won't. I have faith.\"\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER SIX_\n\n\nTwo days later, Underwood received a call from Phyfe, asking for an\nappointment. It was urgent; that was all Phyfe would tell him.\n\nThe archeologist had not heard of the demands of the Disciples. He was\nsurprised to see the construction under way in the great central hall\nwhere the restoration equipment was installed.\n\nHe found Underwood with Illia in the laboratory examining films of the\nprotoplasmic growth.\n\n\"What are you building out there?\" he asked. \"I thought you had all the\nequipment in.\"\n\n\"A monument to human stupidity,\" Underwood growled. Then he told Phyfe\nof the orders he had received. \"We're putting in a balcony so that the\nfaithful can look down upon their Great One. Boarder says we'll have to\nput up with this nonsense for six months.\"\n\n\"Why six months?\"\n\n\"Demarzule will be revived by then or else we'll have failed. In either\ncase, the Disciples will have come to an end.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nUnderwood glanced up in irritation. \"If he's dead, they won't have\nanything to worship. And if he lives, he certainly won't have anything\nto do with them.\"\n\n\"I could ask another 'why,'\" said Phyfe, \"but I'll put it this way.\nYou know nothing of how he will act if he lives. And if he dies he'll\nprobably be a martyr that will establish a new worldwide religion--with\nthose of us who have had to do with this experiment and its failure\nbeing burned at the stake.\"\n\nUnderwood laid down the sheaf of films. Out among the asteroids he\nhad learned to respect the old archeologist's opinions but Dreyer had\nalready laid more of a burden upon him than he felt he should bear.\n\n\"The technological aspects of this problem are more than you say you\nhave found?\"\n\n\"Fortunately for us, certain Stroid records were small metallic plates\nwhose molecular structure was altered according to script or vocal\npatterns. Some of the boys in the lab have developed a device for\nlistening to the audio records. We have actually heard the _voices_ of\nthe Stroids! At least there are sounds that resemble a spoken language.\nBut it is what we have found on the written records that brought me\nhere.\n\n\"More than eighty-five years ago, the most fortunate find previous\nto the discovery of the repository was made. An extensive cache of\nhistorical records was uncovered by Dickens, one of the early workers\nin the field. They were almost fused together, and the molecular\nalteration was barely traceable due to exposure to terrific heat.\nBut we've succeeded in separating the plates and transferring their\nrecords in amplified form to new sheets. And we can read them. We\nhave a remarkably complete section of Stroid history just before\ntheir extermination, and, if we are reading it correctly, there's a\nsurprising fact about them.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"They were not native to this Solar System. They were extra-galactic\nrefugees whose home world had been destroyed in something completely\nrevolting in an intellect that would foresee the doom of a world and\nset about to assure its own preservation.\"\n\n\"But that is only your own subjective extension,\" Illia answered.\n\"There is no such semantic concept in the idea.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Isn't there? The egotism, the absolute lack of concern for a\ncreature's fellows--those are semantically contained in it. And that\nis why I'm more than a little afraid of what we shall find if we do\nsucceed in reviving this creature. How is it developing?\"\n\n\"It seems to be going through a sort of conventional embryonic growth,\"\nIllia answered. \"It's already passed a pseudo-blastic stage. So far, it\nhas generally mammalian characteristics; more than that is impossible\nto say. But what about this new evidence enough for my mental capacity.\nI can't and won't give a damn about any other aspects.\"\n\n\"You must!\" Phyfe's eyes were suddenly afire, demanding, unyielding.\n\"We have new evidence--Terry may have been right when he asked to have\nthe protoplasm destroyed.\"\n\nIllia froze. \"What evidence?\"\n\n\"What type of mentality would attempt to preserve itself through a\nplanetary catastrophe that destroyed all its contemporaries?\" asked\nPhyfe. \"I find some great interstellar conflict and whose enemies\neventually traced them and destroyed for the second time the world\non which they lived. Out of all that ancient people, destroyed as\ncompletely as was Carthage, only this single individual remained.\n\n\"Do you see the significance of that? If he lives, he will live again\nwith the same war-born hate and lust for revenge that filled him as he\nsaw his own world fall!\"\n\n\"It won't survive the knowledge that all that he fought for\ndisappeared geologic ages past,\" objected Underwood. \"Besides, you are\ncontradicting yourself. If he was so unconcerned about his own world,\nperhaps he had no interest in the conflict. Maybe he was the supreme\ngenius of his day and wanted only to escape from a useless carnage that\nhe could not stop.\"\n\n\"No, there is no contradiction,\" said Phyfe earnestly. \"That is typical\nof the war leader who has brought his people to destruction. At the\nmoment when disaster overwhelms them, he thinks only of himself. The\nspecimen we have here is a supreme example of what such egocentric\ndesires for self-preservation lead to.\"\n\nPhyfe abruptly rose from the chair and tossed a sheaf of papers on the\nlaboratory bench. \"Here it is. Read it for yourself. It's a pretty free\ntranslation of the story we found on Dickens' records.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe left abruptly. Illia and Underwood turned to the short script he had\nleft behind and began reading.\n\nThe hundred mighty vessels of the Sirenian Empire flung themselves\nacross space that was made tangible by their velocity. The impregnable\nheart of the fleet was deep in the hull of the flagship, _Hebrian_,\nwhere the Sirenian Hetrarra, Demarzule, slumped sullenly before the\ncomplex panel that reported all the workings of his vast fleet.\n\nBeside him was the old but sinewy figure of Toshmere, the genius who\nhad saved this remnant of the once mighty empire that could have put a\nmillion vessels like these into space at one time.\n\nToshmere said, \"Further flight is useless. Our instruments show that\nthe Dragbora are gaining. Their fleet outnumbers us ten to one. Even\nwith my protective screens, we can't hope to resist long. They've got\nthe one weapon we can't withstand. They're determined to wipe out the\nlast of the Sirenian Empire.\"\n\n\"And I'm determined to wipe out the last of the Dragbora!\" Demarzule\nsnapped in sudden fury. He rose out of the chair and paced the room. \"I\nshall live! I shall live to see their world blasted to energy and the\nlast Dragbor dead. Is the repository nearly ready?\"\n\nToshmere nodded.\n\n\"And you are certain of your method?\"\n\n\"Yes. Would you care to see our final results?\"\n\nDemarzule nodded and Toshmere led the way through the door and down the\nlong corridor to the laboratory where lay Demarzule's hopes of spanning\nthe eons and escaping the enemy who had sworn no quarter.\n\nThe Sirenian Hetrarra watched impassively as the scientist put a\nsmall animal into a bowl-like chamber. He backed away behind a shield\nand pressed a switch. Instantly, the animal was bathed in a flood of\norange glow and a terrible look of pain crossed the animal's face while\nhideous cries came from its throat.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"It is not pleasant,\" observed Demarzule.\n\n\"No,\" said Toshmere. \"But it is necessary that it be done with full\nconsciousness of mind. Otherwise, proper restoration cannot be made.\"\n\nThe ruler was impassive as the animal's cries slowly died while its\nbody melted under the glow of the beam--literally melted until it\nflowed into a pool at the bottom of the bowl where it quivered with\nresidual life forces.\n\n\"Pure protoplasm,\" explained Toshmere. \"It can be frozen to absolute\nzero and the remaining metabolism will be undetectable, yet life will\nremain, perhaps for a thousand _ela_, long enough for new worlds to\nform and old ones die.\"\n\n\"Long enough for the last Dragbor to die--while I, Demarzule, Hetrarra\nof Sirenia, live on in glory and triumph.\"\n\nToshmere smiled a thin smile that Demarzule did not see in his own\npreoccupation. What a tragedy for the civilizations of the Universe\nif Demarzule or any remnant of the Sirenian Empire should survive,\nToshmere thought. The Dragbora had well considered their plans when\nthey set upon a program of complete extermination for the Sirenians.\n\nHis own life would be far more worthy of salvation from the impending\ndoom than that of Demarzule. From the first moment that he had\nconceived the repository and presented the idea to Demarzule, Toshmere\nhad planned that it would hold not Demarzule, but Toshmere himself.\n\nThere was only one way to go ahead with such a gigantic project,\nhowever, and that was letting Demarzule believe that it would be for\nhim. Since it could not be prepared in secret, Demarzule would have to\nassent to the construction. He would do that if he thought it were for\nhimself. The idea would appeal to his egotistical mind; the thought of\nhis own personality spanning the eons, while all the civilization he\nknew decayed and was swept away, would delight him.\n\n\"The revival,\" said Demarzule. \"Let me see how life is to be brought\nback.\"\n\nToshmere swung another projector into line above the bowl and snapped\nanother switch. Invisible rays suddenly bathed the mass of shapeless\nprotoplasm within the bowl. As they watched, it quivered and flowed,\nswiftly changing shapes, and growth and life took possession of it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe ruler of the Sirenians watched the reformation of the animal in the\nbowl. Limbs and torso formed in shadowy gray outline, then abruptly\nsolidified and the animal leaped up, alive and startled.\n\nEven Demarzule was somewhat taken aback by the seeming miracle. \"It is\nswift,\" he remarked. \"The specimen is unharmed?\"\n\n\"Completely,\" said Toshmere. \"The process is not so rapid after a long\nperiod of time has elapsed. The level of life is very low, but never\nwill it completely disappear. The lower it is, however, the longer it\ntakes for restoration. After many hundred _ela_, it might require as\nmuch as a _tor-ela_.\"\n\n\"But it would be sure to succeed regardless?\"\n\nToshmere nodded.\n\nThe hundred ships of the Sirenian bore on their steady course with the\nenemy constantly gaining even though Galaxies away. At last the lookout\nspotted a likely System in which the fifth planet showed signs of\nhabitability. Demarzule ordered preparations be made for a halt.\n\nThe planet they found was inhabited by the remnants of a dying\ncivilization that had retro-graded almost to its infancy. The\nopposition offered was quickly disposed of and the Sirenian refugees\nbegan the frantic and hopeless task of constructing defenses against\nthe coming of the overwhelming force of the Dragbora, defenses they\nknew were as penetrable as air to the new, fearful weapon strength of\nthe enemy.\n\nBut while gigantic screen generators were swiftly reared against\nthe sky and beam emplacements were dug, the best and wisest of the\nscientists were busy preparing the repository for the Hetrarra,\nDemarzule.\n\nThe huge, crystal-like container, which would be rendered impervious to\nall known forces except the key frequency whose formula was inscribed\nupon the outside, was to be lowered thousands of feet into the great\nore beds of the planet, in the hope of avoiding the final blast that\nwould shear the planet.\n\nTwo men would go into that repository, but only one would survive the\neons.\n\nToshmere was the only one completely acquainted with the entire process\nso that it would be necessary for him to direct the operation of the\ninstruments. But Toshmere knew that Demarzule had no intention of\nallowing him to leave the repository with knowledge of its secrets--any\nmore than Toshmere intended that Demarzule should be the one to benefit\nby those secrets.\n\nFor three _tor-ela_ the Sirenians worked frantically, putting up\ntheir mighty defense works, and then their lookout posted a hundred\nthousand light years out in space announced the arrival of the terrible\nDragboran fleet--just before a tongue of light from that fleet lashed\nout at him and swept him into the eternities.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nToshmere approached Demarzule in his headquarters as the word came.\n\"There is not much time left, Hetrarra. The repository is ready.\"\n\nDemarzule looked out upon the sprawling works and great machines so\npitifully huddled together on an alien planet. This was all that\nremained of the vast empire which he had dreamed of extending to the\nlimits of space itself, the empire over which he was to have been\nsupreme Hetrarra. And in a short moment this remnant would be wiped out\nunder the devastating supremacy of the now mightier Dragbora.\n\nHe looked at Toshmere hesitantly. In the face of certain death the old,\nlean, sinewy scientist showed nothing but calm. The Hetrarra took one\nfinal glance at the remnants of his Sirenian Empire and nodded.\n\n\"I am ready,\" he said.\n\nThey went out to the entrance to the shaft leading toward the heart of\nthe planet. The shaft had been built with the knowledge of only a few\nSirenians and none of them were aware of its purpose, thinking rather\nthat it was a means of defense.\n\nNobody saw the Hetrarra and the genius Toshmere enter the elevator that\ncarried them forever into the depths below the surface of the planet.\n\nUnderwood and Illia came to the end of the page and Underwood swore\nsoftly as he thumbed through the few remaining sheets. There was no\nmore about the ancient Demarzule and Toshmere.\n\nThe writer of the history had apparently been one of the Sirenian\nscientists, a confidant and friend of Toshmere who had been close to\nhim in those last days. He had been one of the few to witness the\ndescent of the two into the depths of the planet, but he knew nothing\nof what happened when they reached the bottom and sealed the repository.\n\n_He did not know which one had survived in that mighty struggle that\nmust have taken place below._\n\nAnd shortly no one of the Sirenians cared what the fate of their\ndeserting Hetrarra might have been, for the great Dragboran fleet was\nupon them. With the mighty, unknown weapon that struck terror to the\nmightiest of Sirenia, they sped out of space and swiftly nullified the\nSirenian defenses. It was a carnage that was frightful even to the\nSirenians, so schooled in the methods of shedding blood. Their defenses\nmight not have existed for all the effect they had on their enemy. At\nfirst one by one, and then by tens, the operators were touched by death\nand their machines turned to molten ruin.\n\nAt last, when only incandescent metal and sprawling dead lay of the\nSirenian fleet, the enemy ships withdrew, and the handful of survivors\ndared hope that there might be escape for them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut there was none. As the fleet withdrew beyond their vision, a\nsingle small ship appeared in the heavens and they screamed with the\nknowledge of what it was. But they were dead long before the planet\nexploded into its component fragments which hurtled in all directions\ninto space.\n\nUnderwood put the manuscript down, his mind reluctant to close the\nscene of vast and terrible battle that had occurred so long ago. It\nhad answered some of the problems raised by asteroidal archeology. It\nexplained the utter lack of relationship between Stroid III, which\nwas the language of the Sirenians, and Stroid I and II, which were\nundoubtedly native to the vanished planet.\n\nBut this snatch of history prepared by the unknown scientist companion\nof Toshmere raised the greatest enigma of all.\n\nIllia's eyes looked up into Underwood's. \"Who could have won?\" she\nsaid. \"If it was Toshmere, the alien will be all that we hoped he would\nbe. If it is Demarzule, then Terry is right--he should be destroyed.\"\n\nUnderwood glanced out toward the nutrient bath where the alien slept,\nwhere the shadowy outlines of a faintly human figure already appeared\nin the misty depths of the nutrient solution.\n\n\"It's got to be Toshmere,\" he said, and hoped he was right.\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER SEVEN_\n\n\nThe viewing balcony above the floor of the museum hall was completed\nand the disciples of the Great One began to flow through in a\nnever-ending stream. To Underwood, it was a sickening, revolting sight.\nAs he watched the faces of those who came and worshipped at the shrine,\nhe saw them transformed, as if they had seen some great vision. They\ncame with burdens of care lining their faces--all ages, young and\nold--and they left with shining eyes and uplifted faces. There were\neven sick and crippled who came and left crutches, eyeglasses and\ntrusses.\n\nTwice a day, William B. Hennessey stood upon the balcony and uttered a\nprayer to the Great One, and the stream of fanatic worshipers stopped\nand bowed down.\n\nOne of Underwood's biologists, Craven, was so fascinated by the\nexhibition of mass hysteria that he asked for permission to make a\nstudy of it.\n\nUnderwood forced the spectacle out of his mind. He knew he couldn't\nendure staying there at the museum if he allowed his mind to dwell upon\nthe decadence of mankind.\n\nThe mass of protoplasm in the nutrient bath was becoming more and more\na typical mammalian embryo, anthropomorphic in most respects, but with\ndifferences that Illia and Underwood could not assign to the natural\ndevelopment of the creature, or to the unusual circumstances of its\nrevival, because there was no standard with which to compare it.\n\nThen, one day near the end of the fourth month, Underwood received an\nurgent call from Phyfe.\n\n\"Come over at once!\" he said. \"We've found the answer in the\nrepository. We know who the Great One is.\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"I want you to see for yourself.\"\n\nUnderwood swore as Phyfe cut off. He turned his observations over\nto the operator on duty and left the building. The lexicography and\nphilography sections of the institute were in an old sprawling block\nacross the city by the spaceport; the semantics section was also housed\nthere. The repository had been taken there for continued examination.\n\nDreyer and Phyfe met him. The old archeologist was trembling with\nexcitement. \"I've found the mummy!\" he said.\n\n\"What mummy?\"\n\n\"The mummy of the one in the repository who was killed by the\nsuccessful one.\"\n\n\"Who was it?\"\n\n\"You'll see. He left a record for the discoverers of the repository.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey went into the enclosure that had been built to house the alien\nstructure. Inside, the repository looked many times the size it had\nappeared in space. Underwood followed them into the familiar passages.\nThey went down into the main chamber which had held the protoplasm of\nthe Great One. Then Underwood observed an opening leading lower down.\n\n\"You found a way into the rest of the repository?\"\n\n\"Yes, and how unfortunate we were not to have found our way into that\nportion first. But come.\"\n\nPhyfe disappeared through the narrow opening and they passed three\nlevels filled with unknown artifacts. Then at last they came to the\nsmallest chamber formed by the curve of the outside hull. It was too\nsmall for them to stand upright and filled rapidly with Dreyer's cigar\nsmoke.\n\n\"There it is, right where we found it,\" said Phyfe.\n\nUnderwood looked at the thing without recognition. It appeared as if a\nrather huge, dried-up bat had been carelessly tossed into the corner of\nthe chamber.\n\n\"Completely dessicated,\" said Phyfe. \"He didn't stay here long enough\nbetween his death and the destruction of the planet for decay to\nset in. He simply dried up as the molecules of water were frozen and\ndispersed. I wish there were some way the biologists could find to\nrestore him. He's so shapeless it's difficult to tell what he looked\nlike.\"\n\n\"But who is he?\"\n\n\"Here is the record he left. Apparently they had some kind of small\nelectric tool they carried with them to write on metallic surfaces. How\nthey read them is a mystery because we have to have a mass of equipment\nas big as this chamber to decipher the stuff. Here are photographs of\nhis message that we have rendered visible.\"\n\nUnderwood took the sheaf of photographs. They showed the walls of the\nchamber including the dried mummy lying inert where it had fallen\nin pain and death. But standing out in sharp white characters was a\nlengthy inscription written by the ancient creature of eons ago.\n\n\"Can you read it?\" asked Phyfe.\n\nUnderwood scanned the characters and nodded slowly. He had not been\nable to keep up on the language as Phyfe had, but he could read it now\nwith fair facility.\n\nThe first part of the message was a brief reiteration of the history\nof the ill-fated refugees that he already knew, but then he came to a\nfresh portion.\n\n\"Demarzule has slain me!\" the message read.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe words were like pellets of ice suddenly shot with bullet speed into\nhis face. He looked up at the impassive faces of the other two men and\nread there the decision they had made.\n\nThen, slowly, his eyes lowered to the sheet again and he went on\ndeliberately with the reading.\n\n\"I have attempted to get to the main chamber and destroy the\ntransformation equipment, but I cannot. Demarzule has learned how to\noperate the equipment. Though there is nothing creative in him, and all\nhis aims are of conquest and destruction, he still has the command of\nvast stores of Sirenian science.\n\n\"I am not a warrior or clever in the ways of fighting. It was not\ndifficult for Demarzule to best me. I die soon, therefore it is for you\nwho may read this in the ages to come. This is my message to you, my\nwarning: Destroy the contents of the protoplasm chamber without mercy.\nDemarzule is there and he will be the scourge of any civilization in\nwhich he arises. He dreams of conquest and he will not rest until he\nis master of the Universe. He has destroyed galaxies; he will destroy\nothers if he lives again. Kill him! Erase all knowledge of the dreadful\nSirenian Empire from your memory!\n\n\"Should you be tempted to restore the Hetrarra and believe your science\na match for ours, remember that the knowledge required to enter this\nrepository is only the minimum. It is the lowest common denominator of\nour civilization. Therefore, kill--\"\n\nThe record ended with the last scrawled admonition of the ancient\nscientist, Toshmere.\n\nFor long moments, the chamber of the repository was silent. Phyfe made\nno comment as Underwood finished. He saw the tensing of the physicist's\njaw and the staring fixation of his eyes, as if he would penetrate\nthe ages with his naked vision and try to picture the dying scientist\nscrawling his message on the walls of the death chamber.\n\nThen Phyfe said at last, \"We can't risk the revival of Demarzule now,\nDel. Think what it would mean to turn loose a mentality having command\nof such a superior science.\"\n\n\"We're not exactly planning to turn him loose,\" said Underwood\ndefensively. \"We'll still have control when he revives. He can be kept\nin suitable confinement--and finally disposed of, if necessary. It\nseems worth it if we could tap the science he knows.\"\n\n\"Are you forgetting that we do _not_ have control of him in any\nsense of the word? The Disciples have. We're under direction of\nthe Institute, which can be wiped out in an instant by the Science\nCommittee. They, in turn, are mere puppets of the Disciples who hold\nthe voting power. When Demarzule revives, he'll have a ready made\nfollowing who'll regard him not only as Emperor, but as god. I tell you\nwe have no alternative but destruction.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUnderwood's jaws tightened further. Within his grasp was a science\nthat might represent thousands of years of normal development of the\nSolar system. He could not give up a gift such as the Sirenian culture\noffered.\n\nThen his eyes found those of Dreyer, who had said nothing, who sat\non his heels placidly in his haze of smoke. And there he read the\nirrevocable answer.\n\n\"All right,\" he said. \"You win--you and old Toshmere. Let's get inside\nto a phone and I'll give the word to turn the radiation off.\"\n\nSwiftly now they clambered up the stairs as if to escape some foul tomb\nof the long-dead. They hurried into the building and into the office of\nPhyfe. There Underwood called Illia.\n\nShe answered instantly, as if she had been waiting for his message,\nfearfully and without hope.\n\n\"It's Demarzule, the conqueror,\" he said. \"Turn off the radiation and\ndrain the tank. We'll stand the consequences of that, but we dare not\ngo on with the restoration.\"\n\nIllia bit her lip and nodded. \"It might have been Earth's great\nchance,\" she said, and there was something like a sob in her voice.\n\"I'll turn it off at once.\"\n\nPhyfe said, \"Know what, Underwood? There's going to be trouble over\nthis. I think I'll ask for a transfer back to the expedition. Would you\nlike to come along with us?\"\n\n\"I suppose so, but I'm afraid the Scientific Committee won't let us\nget away that easily. You and I are through for the rest of our lives.\nDidn't you think of that, Phyfe? We'll be lucky if we don't have to\nspend the rest of our lives in prison. But, Dreyer, you don't need to\nbe caught in this. Get away before they come for us.\"\n\n\"I hadn't considered it that way,\" said Phyfe, \"but I suppose you're\nright. The Disciples won't be likely to let us get away this easy, will\nthey?\"\n\nBefore Dreyer could speak, a call came through on the office\ninterphone. Phyfe switched on and the frantic face of Esmond, one of\nthe junior archeologists, appeared.\n\n\"Phyfe!\" the man exclaimed. \"I don't know what it is all about, but the\npolice are on the way down to your office. They have warrants for the\narrest of you and Dr. Underwood!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPhyfe nodded. \"Thanks, Esmond. I'll see that there's no trouble for\nyou because of this. I appreciate it. They didn't lose any time,\ndid they?\" he said to Underwood. \"But as long as Demarzule has been\ndestroyed, we've accomplished what we've tried to do.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute!\" said Underwood. \"Do we know that Demarzule has been\ndestroyed? Something must have gone wrong; the police came too quickly.\"\n\n\"Look!\" Shaken out of his customary calm, Dreyer was pointing through\nthe window across the city.\n\nThere, where they knew the Carlson to be, was a great shining bubble of\nlight.\n\n\"A force shell!\" Underwood exclaimed. \"How--?\"\n\n\"They have evidently been prepared for a long time,\" said Dreyer.\n\nUnderwood tried the phone again and called for Illia, but there was\nno response from inside the shell of impenetrable energy. A moment of\nterrible fear caught Underwood up in its turbulence. What of Illia? Was\nshe all right?\n\n\"Whatever the answer,\" Phyfe exclaimed, \"it's a ten to one shot that\nDemarzule is not destroyed. In which case we'd better not be taken!\"\n\n\"What can we do? They'll have the building surrounded. There'll be no\nchance of getting out.\"\n\n\"This is an old building. There are rooms and sub-basements that few\nknow about, and the staff are all scientists. They'll be loyal. Come\non!\"\n\n\"No, wait,\" said Underwood. \"Nothing can be gained by my hiding in\nthis rabbit warren underneath the city. There is only one chance of\ndestroying Demarzule, and that is my getting back to the museum and\ndoing it personally.\"\n\n\"You're crazy! The Disciples will never let you back in there. Come on,\nman, we're wasting time!\"\n\n\"You two go on and hide, Phyfe. I'll try to lay the blame on you and a\ngroup of scientists, and swear my own innocence. It's the only way to\nget access to Demarzule. Get going. Wait--have you got a burner?\"\n\n\"In the drawer there. We'd better take it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUnderwood yanked open the drawer and found the weapon. Then he held the\nmuzzle a short distance from his upper arm and fired. His face twisted\ninvoluntarily with pain and Phyfe stared in amazement. \"What for?\" the\narcheologist demanded.\n\nUnderwood tossed him the weapon as the room filled with the stench of\nhis burned flesh. \"You shot me when I refused to order the radiation\noff. It's a thin story and if they won't believe it I'll be a goner.\nBut if we don't risk it, Demarzule will be the next ruler of Earth.\"\n\nDreyer nodded. \"It's a chance. You'd better take it. Good luck.\"\n\nA sudden commotion down the hall outside the door warned of the\napproach of the arresting officers. Phyfe gave a last despairing glance\nat Underwood, who was clutching the painful burn on his arm. The\narcheologist turned and darted swiftly through a door at the rear of\nthe office, followed by Dreyer.\n\nAlmost instantly the main door was flung wide and two heavily armed\nofficers burst into the room. Their impulsive charge was halted as they\nstared at the groaning physicist.\n\n\"Get help,\" Underwood said desperately. \"I've got to get to the museum.\nIt may not be too late if Dr. Morov turned the beam off. Phyfe forced\nme to order it stopped. Scientists don't want the Great One revived. He\nshot me when I refused. Would have killed me if--\"\n\nUnderwood sagged forward over the desk and fainted from the pain\nhe could no longer endure.\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER EIGHT_\n\n\nThe beefy Committee Chairman regarded Underwood in the crowded hearing\nroom with the self-righteous, detached anger of one who represents\napproximately a million voters. He told Underwood, \"The reprieve\nyou have been granted is not given because your crime is considered\nany less grievous. Because your act threatened a possession of this\ngovernment which may potentially change the entire life of Earth for\nthe better, your crime is deemed punishable by death.\n\n\"However, you are the only man capable of directing the project.\nTherefore, your sentence is commuted and will be resolved if you\nsuccessfully conclude the project of restoring the Great One. Only by\nso doing may you prove your innocence. If an accident brings failure,\nthree separate committees of competent scientists will bring a verdict\nthat will determine whether you shall live.\"\n\n\"And what of Dr. Illia Morov?\"\n\n\"Her sentence is life imprisonment for her attempt to destroy the Great\nOne.\"\n\n\"She obeyed my orders given under duress, as I have explained. I\ncannot be responsible for the successful restoration if I am to be\ndenied competent assistance. Her knowledge is absolutely essential to\nthe success of the work.\"\n\nThe chairman frowned. \"The civil courts have exercised judgment. It\nmay be possible for her to be bound over to us as you were, but her\nsentence cannot be commuted except by special appeal and retrial. We\nwill see what can be done in the matter.\"\n\nUnderwood choked back the blast he would like to have hurled, his\ndenunciation of everything that symbolized the rotten culture into\nwhich he had been driven by accident of birth. He dared hope only that\nIllia would be granted leniency, that somehow they could think of a way\nto destroy the alien.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe had forced his mind shut against all possibilities of antagonism\nbetween the culture of Sirenia and that of Earth. Now he was aware of\nthe full potentialities of a mind like Demarzule's, armed with Sirenian\nsuper-science, loose among Earthmen, and he was motivated by an urge\nto destroy that was as great as his former desire to save and restore.\nEarth was in bad enough shape without a Demarzule.\n\nFor himself and for Illia he almost dared hope that they might find\nescape from the wrath of the Disciples--perhaps to the Venusian\ncolonies--for there was nothing left for them upon Earth.\n\nThe Chairman added with deadly significance, \"Just to make sure that no\nrisk is being taken with the Great One, you will be constantly attended\nby an armed guard. You will carefully explain every move before you\nmake it--otherwise you may not be alive to make it.\"\n\nThat was all then. Underwood was led out under heavy guard between the\nrows of watchers, most of whom were Disciples. He could almost feel the\ndoubt and hate directed toward him.\n\nWhen he returned to the museum, guards of the Disciples stood\neverywhere. The scientists worked with blank, expressionless faces--and\nguns at their backs.\n\nCraven, the biologist who had made detailed studies of the Disciples,\nglanced up from his desk uncertainly as Underwood walked in. He had\nbeen placed in charge temporarily during the absence of Illia and\nUnderwood.\n\n\"I'm sorry about--everything, Del. Especially about Dr. Morov. When I\nsaw her turning off the radiation I knew that something was wrong, but\nwhen she said that word had come from you to do it, I knew it was time\nfor us to take over. I'm glad that they found you were not in sympathy\nwith the scientists who wanted the Great One destroyed.\"\n\nHis words refused to fall into place in Underwood's mind so that they\nmade sense. But after a moment it came--though there were personal\nguards attached to every other scientist in the place, there was none\nstanding watch over Craven. So Craven was one of them, a Disciple. And\nif Craven, why not others?\n\nBut the biologist had been studying the Disciples from a scientific\nstandpoint. Had he succumbed in spite of that or because of it?\n\nIt was a problem beyond Underwood's grasp. He evaded a reply with:\n\"How is everything going? Is the cell division increasing? Intensities\nof radiation and nutrient solution being stepped up according to our\nplans?\"\n\nCraven nodded. \"As far as I can tell, the Great One is developing\nproperly. You'll want to make a complete check, of course. The daily\nreports are ready for your inspection.\"\n\nUnderwood grunted and left, followed by the silent, ever-present guard.\nHe went out to the test board where the trio of technicians kept\nconstant watch on the processes. Everything was functioning according\nto instructions in the repository--instructions prepared by Toshmere.\n\nEverywhere were the guards, and up on the balcony were the unending\nstreams of Disciples of the Great One. It was like a nightmare to\nUnderwood. How had control of the project slipped away? It had happened\nso rapidly and insidiously that he had not been aware. But that was\nnot it; the truth was that he had never had control. From the moment\nthat the scientists brought the protoplasm of Demarzule to Earth and\nrevealed the story of their find, it had been inevitable.\n\nInevitable, Underwood thought, and the greatest semantic blunder ever\nmade. It might have been a good thing if it had been Toshmere instead\nof Demarzule. The world had had no leaders for a century except the\nbungling, vote-buying politicians. Toshmere might have led them back to\na semblance of strength and initiative, but what would the conqueror\nand destroyer, Demarzule, do?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe following day, Illia returned. Underwood was shocked by her\nappearance. She had dreamed of a new and saner world to be brought by\nthe alien out of space, just as Underwood had dreamed of a new world of\nscience to be revealed. And now their dreams had turned into a monster.\n\nThe worst of their meeting was that there was nothing they could say\nto each other. Illia came into the tiny world of nightmare under the\nforce shell in the custody of guards, and one remained constantly by\nher side as she resumed her duties. Likewise, Underwood's own guard\nnever left him. Underwood had to maintain his pretense of innocence\nbefore them.\n\n\"It was Phyfe and Dreyer,\" he said to Illia. \"I'm glad you didn't\nsucceed in destroying Demarzule.\"\n\nShe hesitated an instant, then nodded with understanding. \"I didn't\nknow what you were doing, but I supposed there was some reason. I\ndidn't suspect their evil plot.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd that was all. There was nothing more they could say. Nothing of her\ndespair at her white-faced, lusterless appearance. Nothing of her lost\ndream.\n\nThe mass grew and took shape. Limbs and head and torso were distinctly\nformed and losing their fearsome, embryonic cast. The creature would\nbe of adult form and shape, Underwood saw, and would not represent a\nreturn to infancy. It was fully eight feet tall and was humanoid to the\nextent of having four limbs and head and torso, but the X-rays showed\nradical differences in bone and joint structure. One cranial and two\nabdominal organs were completely unfamiliar and could be identified by\nnone of the biologists on the project.\n\nFor a time Underwood nursed the hope that these structural differences\nmight make it impossible for Demarzule to survive on Earth. But the\nfurther the lungs developed, the more evident it became that the\nSirenian would adapt to the atmosphere. As to food, there was little\ndoubt that nourishment would be no problem. By the sixth month, too, it\nwas hopeless to assume that anything would go wrong with the process of\nrestoration. Toshmere had planned too well.\n\nUnderwood wondered what had become of Phyfe and Dreyer, if they had\nbeen captured and killed, or if they still lived in the depths of the\nancient buildings beneath the city. There had been absolutely no word.\nHe had been kept in complete isolation since their tragic failure. He\nspoke to no one except the silent guards and his fellow technicians.\nHe knew of none that he could trust, for he was certain that among the\nscientists working beside him, there were those whose duty it was to\nspy upon him. Craven, for example, had become more sullen day by day,\nand now he avoided Underwood almost continually, as if ashamed of the\nthings that he believed in and had done, but unable to renounce them\nor help himself. The symptoms of hysteria were becoming constantly more\nevident.\n\nUnderwood looked for them in the other scientists, but he was not\nskilled enough to detect all the signs. The only way was to play safe\nand take no one into his confidence.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLife went on timelessly in the nightmare world. The light of day was\ncompletely obscured by the force shell. As Underwood strolled out of\nthe museum building and looked up at its blackness, he recalled how it\nhad saved the world centuries ago, when mankind had once before been\non the verge of self-destruction in the dim beginnings of the atomic\nage. Only by the discovery of the force shell, a field impenetrable\nby any substance or radiation or force, had men been saved from total\nannihilation.\n\nBut now man was faced by another potent force of destruction--his own\ndesire to submit to any leader who promised relief from independent\nresponsibility and action. The alien would certainly be able to fulfill\nthat promise where no man could, but was it worth the risk of being\nsaddled with a bloody dictatorship?\n\nIt was fantastic, Underwood thought, that he could find no way to elude\nhis guards and kill the growing monster. Variations in the strength\nof the radiation might do it, but there was no possibility of varying\nthe radiation. The guards, whose leaders were technically trained,\nhad access to the records of the scientists, which not only gave the\ndetails of previous work, but outlined each step until Demarzule was\nrestored. Underwood dared not attempt departures of procedure from the\nwritten notes. The bath itself had been surrounded by a transparent\nguard impervious to solid shot or radiation weapons--even if he could\nhave obtained any--nor could poisons be placed in the nutrient solution.\n\nThere was simply nothing that could be done while Demarzule was still\nin the nutrient bath. But on the day of his arising? A desperate,\nlast-ditch plan formed in Underwood's mind.\n\nHe explained to his guard, \"When the Great One arises, it would be\nwell for someone to welcome him in his own tongue. Only a few of us\nscientists are able to, and of those who can, I am the only one here.\nWith your permission, I'll be beside him and welcome him when he rises.\"\n\nThe guard considered. \"I'll relay your request to the First High\nProphet Hennessey. If it is deemed fitting you shall be appointed to\nwelcome the Great One.\"\n\nUnderwood wished that he had given Hennessey a warmer welcome that\nfirst day when the fanatic prophet came to his office, but Hennessey\ngave permission immediately. Underwood imagined the Prophet taking\nconsiderable satisfaction in the irony of Underwood being the first to\nwelcome the Great One.\n\nMounted beside the narrow catwalk between the observation board and\nthe bath were the controls which would finally cut the radiation and\ndrain the nutrient solution as the process of restoration came to an\nend. Here also were the water valves used to flush the bath when it had\nfirst been constructed.\n\nIn this narrow space, Underwood could escape the watching eye of his\nguard for an instant. He hoped to be able to cut the radiation and\ndrain the bath prematurely. If that couldn't be done, he might fill the\nbath with water and drown Demarzule before the guards could intervene\nor reach the shutoff valve. Underwood had managed to secrete a small\nbar in his pocket with which he hoped to break the valve after it was\nopened.\n\nThe massive form of Demarzule had been stirring like an embryo for days\nnow, and Underwood watched closely for the first attempt to rise. That\nwould be the earliest moment that he could hope to make an attempt to\ndestroy the Sirenian.\n\nHe wished he could confide in Illia, but there was no chance. He feared\nshe might have some desperate, dangerous plan of her own.\n\nThe color of the Sirenian's skin had turned a deep hue, like dark\nredwood, and that appeared to be its natural tone. The hair upon the\nhead was coppery, darker than the skin. Demarzule's whole appearance\nwas one of might and strength even as he lay quiescent. His features\nwere bold, with wide-set eyes and sharp nose. The mouth was stern,\nalmost harsh.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHysteria among the Disciples was mounting hourly. Instead of flowing\nthrough the building along the balcony in their endless stream, they\npoured in and stayed, hoping to be there for the rising of the Great\nOne. Some were pushed over and killed by the fall to the floor below.\nThey overflowed into the main hall and swarmed about the masses of\nequipment. This was welcomed by Underwood, who hoped that the pressing\nmob might damage some of the equipment and thus bring about the end of\nDemarzule.\n\nIn any event, the hysteria was having its effects upon the guards, who\ncontinued to watch the scientists. Their alertness and efficiency were\ngiving way to the same tension that filled the mobs within the hall\nlike a disease.\n\nUnderwood went sleepless for two days at the end, not daring to miss\nhis one chance. And hundreds of the faithful who jammed the hall and\nthousands more who waited outside had already stood that long waiting\nfor the miracle.\n\nIt was in early dawn when Underwood caught the first faint motion that\nindicated Demarzule was about to rise.\n\nUnderwood jerked a finger in the direction of the bath and looked\nquestioningly at the guard. The man nodded and Underwood raced along\nthe narrow catwalk.\n\nThere was no question of premature draining of the solution and cutting\nthe radiation. It was time for that now. Demarzule was struggling\nupward, his lungs gasping in the first breath of Terrestrian atmosphere\nwhich filled the upper part of the enclosure.\n\nUnderwood cut the radiation switch and twisted the valve on the water\nline with a mighty wrench that tore the wheel from the shaft. Water\nflooded into the chamber.\n\nDemarzule struggled to a sitting position and stared as if dazed, his\ncountenance working fearsomely.\n\nThe Disciples saw him. A shout of ecstasy thundered through the great\nhall and the empty rooms of the museum. And then, suddenly, there was a\nnew sound. A single voice rang out above all the rest.\n\n\"Strike now!\" it shouted. \"Strike down the invader. Destroy the\nblasphemy of the Great One!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUnderwood's head twisted about. There on the balcony in the place\nlately occupied by the Prophet, Hennessey, was Terry Bernard!\n\nFor an instant Underwood could not comprehend the meaning of it. The\ngun in Terry's hand flashed red. Underwood's guard slumped in his\nmurderous rush and fell from the catwalk. He alone had seen the sudden\nrise of water and realized its meaning.\n\nThe cries and curses and screams and prayers that filled the hall made\nthe previous commotion deathly silence by contrast. Sudden beams of\ndeadly fire shot through the air, and Underwood could make no sense of\nit all.\n\nSides in the conflict began to appear. Underwood saw that some of\nthe technicians and scientists had weapons and had disposed of\ntheir guards. Now they were firing carefully into the mob about the\nequipment, picking off the armed leaders.\n\nInside the impenetrable enclosure, the giant Sirenian staggered\nuncertainly as if stunned. The water was rising swiftly about his hips.\nThe air, rushing out the oxygen intake pipe, allowed the water to rise\nin the otherwise hermetically sealed chamber.\n\nA few minutes more and Demarzule would be cut off from the air supply.\nHow long it would take to drown him, Underwood did not know. It would\ndepend largely on his present rate of metabolism, which was a great\nuncertainty. But could the mob be held off that long? They had to be!\nHe bent down and grabbed up the gun that his pursuing guard had dropped.\n\nIn the background of his mind he wondered what this sudden attack\nmeant. How strongly organized was it, and who was behind it? Apparently\nTerry had given the signal for attack, and many of the scientists on\nthe project had been prepared for it, yet Underwood had been given not\nthe slightest hint that such attack would take place. He wondered why\nhe had been left out.\n\nThe screaming of the hysterical Disciples was deafening as those in\nfront tried to force their way back from the line of battle, and those\nin the rear tried to press forward to glimpse Demarzule.\n\nUnderwood leaped down to the floor in the sea of confusion and found\nhimself unable to determine which way the conflict was moving. None of\nthe scientists were near him, only the maddened, unreasoning Disciples.\nHe decided to stay near the water valve to make certain that it was not\nshut off by any of the guards.\n\nThen two figures surged up to him and one grasped his arm. \"Del! Come\non, let's get out of here!\"\n\nHe turned. Terry's blood-streaked face was almost unrecognizable. His\nother hand clutched Illia's arm.\n\n\"You two go on,\" Underwood shouted. \"Get out if you can. I've got to\nstay--to make sure he drowns.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"The water's cut off! Can't you see?\"\n\nUnderwood turned in horror. The water level was falling instead of\nrising. Someone had cut it off at one of the other valves farther along\nthe line and had opened the drain. Air was being pumped through, for\nDemarzule was standing rigidly now, looking down upon the surging mass\nas if contemplating their fate. The bitter animal struggle for survival\nwas gone now from his face, and only a mocking scorn was there as the\nmob battled before him.\n\n\"We've failed!\" Underwood exclaimed. \"It must have been Craven who\nshut the water off. We haven't a chance now.\"\n\n\"Not if we stay here. Come on. We can lose ourselves in this crowd\nand work our way outside. There's a ship waiting to take us across to\nPhyfe. The _Lavoisier_ is manned and ready to go.\"\n\n\"The _Lavoisier!_ Where--?\"\n\n\"Who knows? Go!\"\n\nHopelessly, Underwood allowed himself to be pushed and jammed into the\nthick of the mob by the frantic Terry. Signs of armed conflict were\ndying. Underwood supposed that the scientists had been subdued, for now\nthe hall was completely filled with the Disciples. It was impossible,\nhe thought, that they could ever make their way out without being\napprehended. But even as doubts came, he knew that he had to get out.\nHe had to live to make another stand against the Sirenian.\n\nHe looked back. Demarzule was standing erect now. Slowly his great arms\ncame up and his hands extended as if in blessing and welcome, and the\nmoaning of the ecstatic Disciples rose in wild discordance.\n\nThen out of those alien lips, amplified a thousand fold by the audio\nsystem installed within the chamber to catch any uttered words, there\ncame an alien voice that only Underwood could understand. And as the\nstrange words poured forth he shuddered at their implications.\n\n\"My people.\" Demarzule said. \"My great and mighty people!\"\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER NINE_\n\n\nUnderwood turned as if driven back by the force of the conquering voice\nof thunder that came from the throat of Demarzule.\n\nNo one was paying any attention to the three scientists now. The faces\nof the Disciples were upturned toward the Great One, waiting for\nfurther pronouncements.\n\nUnderwood, Terry and Illia shoved through the wide doors of the hall\nagainst the crowd pressing from outside. As they fought through, the\nenormous voice continued to assail their ears.\n\n\"I have triumphed over death,\" Demarzule exclaimed. \"I have conquered\nthe ages, and now I come to you, my people. I have come to lead you to\nthe stars and to the Galaxies beyond the stars, where your very name\nshall cause the creatures of distant worlds to tremble.\"\n\nEach word was like a knife stabbing into Underwood, for they showed\nthat Demarzule had already comprehended the situation--and mastered\nit. And though the people did not understand the words, the tone of\nhis voice carried the meaning almost equally well, and there were none\nin that mass of worshipping Disciples who doubted that a new day of\ngreatness had dawned for Earth.\n\nAll semblance of organization under the small-time prophets and priests\nsuch as Hennessey had vanished. There had never been much organization\nbecause people did not trust any man sufficiently to compose a very\ntight or efficient organization.\n\nThis was to the benefit of the scientists. It would take time for\nDemarzule to become aware of the opposition and the identity of the\nscientists. But he must surely be aware of the attempt on his life,\nUnderwood thought, unless full consciousness had not returned until\nthe water had begun to subside in the chamber, and Demarzule had not\nrealized the significance of it.\n\nBut Underwood did not believe that. Demarzule had exhibited such rapid\ngrasp of the attitude of the Disciples that he probably possessed a\nsemantic accuracy in his thinking which would shame the best of Earth's\nscientists.\n\nThe three were making more rapid progress now as they pushed out into\nthe part of the mob that could not see Demarzule. Under the black dome\nof the force shell, as far as they could see, the area between the\nbuilding and the outer edge of the shell was filled with struggling\nhumanity. The words of Demarzule could be heard only faintly.\n\n\"The north gate,\" Illia said. \"That is the widest. Maybe the guard\nsystem has broken down completely--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTerry nodded. \"It looks like it. That's the closest to our flier,\nanyway. If we are challenged, let's carry Illia and explain she was\ninjured in the mob. That might get us through. If not, keep your gun\nready.\"\n\nUnderwood assented. He felt as if this were some nightmare from which\nhe was struggling to awaken--unsuccessfully. He wondered what had\nhappened to the other scientists on the project, and to those who had\nattempted the storming of the building. Had they all perished in the\nshort and futile battle?\n\nHe had to admit to himself that at times, during those long days under\nthe surveillance of the Disciple guards, he had wondered if there\nwouldn't have been some chance of utilizing Demarzule's science without\ndanger. That hope, however, had been finally and completely blasted by\nDemarzule's arising. The Sirenian had not changed in half a million\nyears.\n\nAs they savagely thrust through, Underwood considered the course that\nwould probably be followed by Demarzule. He would gather about him a\npuppet organization of administrators who would take on a priestly\nsanctification before the people because of their nearness to the Great\nOne. The organization would tighten about the Earth, enfolding the\nwilling devotees, ruthlessly wiping out small centers of opposition\nthat might spring up.\n\nAt the command of the Disciples would be the world's weapons and\nfactories. And added to these would be the fearful science and unknown\nweapons of the Sirenian.\n\nWhat force could hold back this avalanche?\n\nThe answer was: _None._ There was no force that could touch him,\nnothing the scientists could do to prevent the unleashed forces of\nEarth from sweeping the Galaxies.\n\nFlight. That was the only recourse for those who wished to escape the\ndebacle. But it must be more than flight. However hopeless it seemed,\nthose of Earth's scientists who could be gathered must be dedicated\nto the task of Demarzule's overthrow, the saving of Earthmen from an\ninsane course of conquest.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nClose to the north gate, the distorting energies of the force shell\nwere led around a portion of space to form an opening in the wall. Word\nof the rising of the Great One had spread like a virus and thousands\nwere gathered beyond the shell, trying in vain to force their way in.\nAll semblance of attempting to guard the entrances seemed to have\nvanished as the trio forced their way through the opening and out into\nthe sunlight that seemed utterly blinding to Illia and Underwood, who\nhad not seen it for so long.\n\nFor a moment Underwood wondered if they could not have remained inside\nthe Carlson and taken a chance on shooting Demarzule when he came out\nof the protecting shield about the bath. But he knew better. Demarzule\nwould not come out until the room was cleared and the faithful were\nstanding guard with their guns ready to blast any would-be assassin.\n\nNo, they were on the only course open to them. They were committed to\nit now; there was no turning back.\n\nAt last they came out into a relatively free space where they could\nmove rapidly. Underwood caught sight of the small three-man flier atop\na low rise, a mile from the museum.\n\n\"What about the others?\" Underwood said as they ran. \"Didn't any of\nthem get away?\"\n\n\"I don't think so,\" Terry answered. \"We didn't expect it. Our object\nwas to destroy Demarzule, and, failing that, to get you two.\"\n\nThe two running men, one with bandaged arm and the other with\nbloodsmeared face, and the white-faced girl were attracting unwelcome\nattention, but at last they came to the rise where the flier lay, and\nclimbed in. Without a lost motion, Terry worked the controls and they\nwhirled into the air.\n\nFrom their elevation, Underwood looked back toward the museum, the\nholy sanctuary of the Disciples. The roads leading to the site were\nblack with humanity as the faithful streamed to the building to witness\nthe Great One and hear his voice.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe turned to Terry. \"Bring me up to date.\"\n\n\"They contacted me--I wasn't suspected by the police, you know--and we\norganized a small group of the scientists we felt we could trust. We\ntold them all about Demarzule and our blunder in bringing him back. We\norganized for the purpose of destroying him by any means possible, but\nof course we had no means. The force shell prevented direct attack on\nthe Carlson, so we tried filtering in with the Disciples. Four of us\nwere caught and killed.\n\n\"We didn't try to communicate with you, because we felt it was too\ndangerous, and knew that you would be doing anything possible. We\nsucceeded in getting enough of our number in for the end of the show\nand passing weapons to some of the scientists on the project, but we\napparently lost all our men without doing damage to the Great One. Only\ngetting ourselves lost in that mob saved us three. I suspect that they\nfeel so secure in the protection of Demarzule now that that is their\nonly reason for not gassing the whole mob in order to get us.\"\n\n\"What's your next move?\" asked Illia.\n\n\"The _Lavoisier_ came in two weeks ago for supplies. Most of the crew\nare on our side, and the rest aren't there any more. Phyfe and Dreyer\nare already aboard, as well as the rest of the scientists of our group.\nAll we can do is point the nose up and get going as fast as we can\ntravel. It may be only a matter of hours until Demarzule is aware of us\nand sends a fleet in pursuit. After we get out into space, the rest is\nup to the boss.\" He jerked a thumb in Underwood's direction.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Underwood.\n\n\"I mean that as top-dog physicist and the only one besides us somewhat\nnon-combatant archeologists and semanticists who understands the\nSirenian lingo, not to mention your familiarity with Demarzule, you got\nyourself elected chairman of this delegation.\"\n\nUnderwood laughed shortly and bitterly. \"I'm responsible for the mess,\nso I should be the one responsible for finding a way out. Is that it?\"\n\n\"We'll turn you over to the psychiatric department if you don't cut\nthat out,\" said Terry grimly.\n\n\"Sorry. I'm grateful, of course, that the rest of you think I could be\nuseful, but I'm afraid my brain is a complete blank on how to get out.\"\n\n\"Maybe you think the rest of us aren't the same way,\" said Terry. \"But\nyou're the most qualified of us all to recognize a means of licking\nDemarzule when you see it.\"\n\nUnderwood stared ahead of them toward the expanding view of the\nbuildings where the scientists had held out against the Disciples. He\ntried to picture what the past months had been for them, but he could\nnever know the hundreds of desperate escapes and skirmishes with guards\nand officers, and swift murders in the depths below the city.\n\nBeside the clustered buildings the great laboratory spaceship,\n_Lavoisier_, lay on the experimental grounds, shining in the early\ndawn. Sudden bright spurts of light showed on the field. Illia saw it\nfirst. \"Gunfire!\" she cried.\n\n\"They're being attacked!\" Terry exclaimed. \"We've got to get down\nthere or they may have to leave without us. Get out that pair of heavy\nburners under your seat, Del. We'll have to go in shooting.\"\n\nUnderwood hauled out the weapons as the flier darted swiftly toward\nthe field. A concentrated knot of offense was being offered from the\nbuilding entrance nearest the ship, but other officers were surrounding\nthe ship behind the screen of the distant shrubbery.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I'll fly over them,\" said Terry. \"Give them a good blast with both\nguns.\"\n\nUnderwood opened the port against the wind and pointed the noses of\nthe deadly weapons outward. He clicked the trigger and an unending\nstream of fire hurled toward the earth, sweeping through the lines of\nattackers as they crouched behind the shrubs and fences. Then, swiftly,\nTerry spun the ship to avoid the building and they zoomed upward. At\nthat instant a crippling beam came from below.\n\n\"We're hit!\" Terry exclaimed. \"It killed the motor. Hang on for a crash\nlanding. I'll try to make the port of the ship.\"\n\nUnderwood returned his attention to the guns as if nothing had\noccurred. As the nose dipped, he fired into the building from which the\ndisabling shot had come. He thought he heard a scream of pain, though\nit might have been only the sound of the wind against the shell of the\nlittle flier.\n\nThey were falling fast now, heading for the open port of the large\nspaceship. They could see some of the crew members and scientists\nemerging, weapons ready to protect their landing. They sped down below\nthe level of the top of the hull and the vast sheets of plate seemed to\nflow past the port of the flier like a river of steel.\n\nIt stopped flowing. They hit hard, and Terry yanked open the door. They\ntumbled out in the midst of their defenders, while spurts of flame\nshowed in the sunlight all about them.\n\n\"Get in!\" one of the men shouted. \"We almost had to leave without you.\nThey'll be bringing reinforcements.\" It was Mason, the physicist.\n\nUnderwood nodded. \"We're ready. Is everyone else aboard who is going?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nThere was a sudden cry beside Underwood and one of the crewmen dropped\nhis gun and clutched an arm in pain. Mason and Terry clutched him in\nsupporting arms and dragged him into the vessel. Underwood clasped\nIllia's hand and hurried through the port. Behind them the last of the\nmen slammed the door and dogged it tight.\n\n\"Phyfe's waiting for you in the control room,\" Mason said. \"We'll take\ncare of Peters, here. Terry had better stay for treatment also.\"\n\nUnderwood nodded and raced along the corridor with Illia. They passed\nother men intent upon their own tasks. Some of them he knew; others\nhe had never seen before. He hoped that Phyfe and Terry had chosen\ncarefully. The remembrance of the biologist, Craven, came to his mind.\nThey came to the entrance to the control room. Captain Dawson was in\ntechnical command, waiting for instructions to take off. Apparently\nMason was assuming charge of the takeoff, for his voice came through\nthe audio system as Underwood entered. Phyfe nodded assent to Captain\nDawson. \"Take it up!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAlmost instantly, the ship soared aloft.\n\n\"Wait!\" Underwood exclaimed, as he entered the control room.\n\nPhyfe and Dawson looked toward the door. \"There can be no waiting,\"\nsaid Phyfe. \"We had almost given up you and Terry and Illia. The police\nhave been searching for us for weeks, and now that we're out in the\nopen they'll spare no force to take us.\"\n\n\"We can't go without the Stroid records,\" said Underwood. \"Terry tells\nme I've been elected to head this outfit. If that's so, then my first\norder is to pick up every scrap of Stroid record and artifact that has\never been found before we take off.\"\n\nDreyer came in and looked interestedly as Underwood spoke, but he said\nnothing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Why?\" said Phyfe. \"I don't understand.\"\n\n\"There was a weapon,\" said Underwood, \"a weapon that the Sirenians\nwere afraid of, which apparently was responsible for the power of\nthe Dragbora over them. If any trace of that weapon remains in the\nUniverse, our goal is to find it. It may be our one hope of defeating\nDemarzule.\"\n\nThe others looked at him as if doubting his sanity, yet hoping he was\non the trail of a solution.\n\n\"But that was five hundred thousand years ago!\" said Phyfe. \"How could\nwe hope to find such a weapon that disappeared that long ago? We have\nno clues--\"\n\n\"We have the Stroid records. That's why I want them.\"\n\n\"But the Sirenians seemed to know nothing about the nature of the\nweapon.\"\n\n\"We're not so sure of that. But even if that's so, there was the great\ncivilization of the Dragbora. We don't know that it is extinct, and we\nknow nothing of its location--but the weapon may be there. And the clue\nto _its_ location may be in the Stroid records.\"\n\nDreyer nodded and gave a violent puff of smoke. \"He's right, Phyfe.\nWe hadn't thought of it, but that may be our one chance. At least it\ngives us an objective instead of just plunging into purposeless flight.\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" Phyfe said doubtfully. \"But I don't see how--\"\n\n\"I'll take care of that. Show us where the records are. We'll get the\nrepository first, however; I want the whole thing brought aboard.\"\n\nUnderwood turned swiftly to Dawson and ordered the ship lowered beside\nthe temporary structure housing the repository near the Stroid museum\nbuilding. Then he stepped to the ship's interphone and explained their\nmaneuver. He called for twenty volunteers to man scooters and weapons\nto cover those who were to transfer the records.\n\nBelow them, on the ground, the police forces who watched their prey\nescape stood puzzledly as the _Lavoisier_ turned and moved slowly\nacross the group of buildings and began dropping again. Three deadly\npolice fliers hovered in the air about the great spaceship.\n\nIt was the fliers that Underwood watched with intent study. The twenty\nmen he had selected out of the volunteers gathered around the viewing\nplates with him.\n\n\"The first objective will be to down those fliers,\" said Underwood.\n\"Then you will provide constant cover for those of us who leave the\nship to bring the records back. Go to your assigned airlocks. I'll\nsignal when the fliers are in the best position for one group of you to\nattack it.\"\n\nByers, the engineer mechanic appointed captain of the group, nodded.\n\n\"They won't know what hit 'em,\" he promised.\n\n\"I hope so,\" said Underwood. \"All right, take your stations and signal\nwhen you're ready.\"\n\nThe men filed out of the room while the big ship slowly settled toward\nthe Earth. The three police fliers continued to move about with deadly\ninquisitiveness. Then the sudden signal from Byers indicated the men\nwere positioned and ready.\n\nUnderwood watched the fliers. One was out of sight of the other two\nnear the nose of the _Lavoisier_. Underwood called sharply: \"Number\nthree, attack!\"\n\nAlmost instantly, a lock opened behind the unsuspecting police flier\nand three scooters darted out, their riders firing a deadly stream\nwhich came to a focus on the tail of the flier. A sudden blossom of\nflame sent up a plume of black smoke and the flier nosed Earthward\nwithout its occupants knowing what had struck.\n\nBut now the second flier was rounding the hull and the three scooters\nwere spotted. The police fired and one scooter plummeted out of sight.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Number seven!\" Underwood ordered.\n\nA lock near the top of the hull opened and a second trio of scooters\ndarted out. The flier was beneath them, and its pilots had time to look\nup and see the blasting fire that poured through the transparent bubble\nover them. But they had no time to retaliate.\n\nFire began rising from the ground forces now and the scooter riders\nwere forced to dodge and twist to avoid being hit. At the same time\nthey dived close to the ground and sprayed the attackers.\n\nFrom above, however, the third flier joined with devastating fury. Two\nmore scooters dropped. Underwood ordered the remaining scooters to\nthe attack. Simultaneously, they poured from the ship, swept over the\nremaining flier in a wave of destruction and dropped it onto the ground\nforces.\n\nThe latter spread out now and hunted for cover before the mounting\ndestruction of the scooter riders.\n\n\"Align cargo hatch number one by the repository shelter,\" Underwood\ninstructed the Captain. \"We'll load that first.\"\n\nThe ship settled to the surface without a jar. The immediate area\naround the shelter was cleared. Mason, taking charge of the loading,\nordered the hatch swung open. Portable cargo units were passed out and\nstrapped to the periphery of the huge, faceted artifact, whose bulk\nalmost filled the hatchway.\n\nSporadic fire continued from the hidden police, but the scooter riders\nwere holding it below an effective level without losing any more of\ntheir own number.\n\nMason turned the current into the cargo units, and slowly the huge mass\nrose from the spot where it rested. Then a G-line attached to it began\nreeling in, drawing the repository toward the ship.\n\nAs the hatch clanged shut over it, Underwood exhaled heavily. \"That's\nthe main part of our job! Another half hour to scoop up the records in\nthe building and we'll be through.\"\n\nIllia gave a sudden shrill cry. \"Del! The building--it's on fire!\"\n\nThe men stared. From the museum where the Stroid records lay, there\nrose billows of smoke and licking flames.\n\n\"They must have known what we were after,\" said Phyfe, \"and they fired\nthe building. There's no chance now of getting any of them.\"\n\n\"Yes, there is! Most of the records are metallic.\" Underwood stepped to\nthe interphone. \"Every man but the takeoff crew in spacesuits. Carry\nsidearms and be ready to enter the museum at once.\"\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" Illia cried.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAlready he was at the nearest locker, struggling into the ungainly\nspacesuit. \"These will be enough protection from the fire to enable\neach man to bring out one load, perhaps.\"\n\nThe old building, as if symbolic of the times, was submitting willingly\nto the flames. Its ancient, only partly fireproofed construction was\ngiving way, and the fire protection system had failed completely.\n\nRapidly, Underwood went over the plan Phyfe had given him locating the\nbulk of the records, then raced toward the cargo hold where the others\nwere nearly ready. He ordered each pair of men to tow a cargo carrier.\n\nIt was a weird procession of unworldly figures that made their way\nclumsily from the ship and up the steps of the burning building.\n\nUnderwood and Mason were together, towing their carrier, which rested\na foot off the floor. Almost blinded by the smoke, they led the way\nthrough the halls and into the stacks where the half-million-year-old\nrecords lay on shelves.\n\n\"Load up! This is it,\" Underwood called. Like creatures in some\nfantastic hell, he saw the others file into the large room behind\nhim. They began emptying over the shelves, filling the carriers with\nwhatever came to hand.\n\nThe wooden beams supporting the high, archaic roof structure were dry\nand roaring with flames. Somewhere out of their line of sight, a beam\ngave way and a shower of plaster and masonry filled the air.\n\n\"There won't be time for any more,\" Mason said. \"Our carrier's full.\nLet's go.\"\n\nUnderwood shoved the carrier toward the doorway through which they had\ncome. Its inertia was its only opposition.\n\n\"You drag the carrier,\" said Underwood. \"I'll get another armful.\"\n\nWhile Mason vanished out through the pall of smoke, Underwood scooped\nup another armful of materials. Then, almost blindly, he sought the\nexit.\n\nNearly all the others were loaded and dragging their carriers now.\nUnderwood glanced back. What secrets might yet lie here among the\nrecords they must leave behind! He hoped the gods of chance had been\nmerciful enough to guide their hands toward some record that would\ndirect the scientists to the ancient enemy of the Sirenian Empire,\nthe Dragbora, whose dreadful weapon had been so feared by the Sirenian\nhordes.\n\nBack in the ship, Underwood glanced back longingly at the flame-ravaged\nbuilding. It was useless to attempt another trip.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe police had apparently hoped the fire would defeat the purposes of\nthe scientists, but after the successful rescue of tons of records and\nartifacts, they resumed their attack with increasing fury.\n\nUnderwood called to Byers and the scooter riders to come in. Slowly,\nthe protective forces withdrew to the ship, and as they did so, the\npolice began firing into the opening ports. The scooters poured into\nthe ship, more than one bearing a mortally wounded crewman.\n\nAltogether, only fourteen returned.\n\n\"That's all,\" Byers said grimly. \"The rest of the boys won't be coming\nback.\"\n\nFor a drastic moment of uncertainty, Underwood wondered if his demand\nfor the records would be worth that sacrifice. It had to be, he told\nhimself. Without hope of a weapon to defeat the Sirenian, there was no\npurpose in flight into space.\n\nHe returned to the control room and gave the order to lift ship.\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER TEN_\n\n\nThrough the ports Underwood watched the nearby buildings drop away. The\nSun's disk shot up over the horizon and bathed them in golden glow.\nThen the pilot adjusted the controls and sudden, crushing acceleration\nwas applied to the ship, but to the occupants it was imperceptible.\n\nLike the tired old man that he was, Phyfe slumped down in a cushioned\nseat beside the navigator's table.\n\n\"You look as if you'd had a pretty rough time of it since I saw you\nlast,\" said Underwood.\n\nPhyfe smiled disparagingly. \"For fifty years I've been a scholar and\narcheologist. It's much too late to find myself in the midst of a\nplanetary crisis, and expect to be able to cope with it.\"\n\n\"You've done a fine job so far.\"\n\n\"I could never even lead an expedition very satisfactorily, and\ncertainly not a group of this kind. Terry might, but he lacks the\nphysical knowledge you have. Mason might, but he knows nothing of the\nSirenians. You're the best qualified of us all for the job.\"\n\n\"I want to be sure the rest think so. It might not be a bad idea to\nhold an election.\"\n\n\"We should call a meeting of everyone, anyway. Many of the scientists\nare not adequately acquainted with the problem. They should be\norganized according to their specialties, and we ought to prepare some\nsystem of defense.\"\n\nWith the ship no farther than the orbit of the moon, a meeting was\ncalled of the hundred and twenty-five scientists and crewmen of the\n_Lavoisier_. Phyfe, as nominal chairman, presented Underwood formally\nas leader of the group. Acceptance was unanimous and enthusiastic,\nfor Underwood was known to nearly all of them by reputation if not\npersonally.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBriefly, he outlined the events concerning the discovery and\nrestoration of Demarzule, the futile attempts of the scientists to\nstand against humanity's demand for a new god. Then he called on Dreyer\nto describe the characteristics of the enemy who opposed them.\n\n\"In the ages of Earth's past history,\" Dreyer said, \"there have been\nconquerors, emperors, dictators and tyrants, but there has never been\nDemarzule, the Sirenian. To the Sirenians, conquest and leadership\nwere as essential as food. There was only one solution for them as\nthey expanded in the Galaxy, and that was complete mastery of the\nGalaxies--or extinction. It was undoubtedly fortunate for our own world\nthat the Dragbora succeeded in destroying them.\n\n\"As to our present problem, Demarzule will sell the peoples of Earth\nthe idea of their complete superiority over all other races in the\nUniverse. They're ripe for acceptance of such doctrine. He'll use\nthe supernatural aspect of his appearance among us and encourage\na worshipful attitude. Then he is, I think, certain to begin the\nconstruction of battle fleets and the assembly of weapons and\narmies--not the ships and weapons we know, but the best that Sirenian\nscience could produce half a million years ago.\n\n\"Within a few hours from now he'll be sure to learn of our escape\nand our identity as enemies. It is impossible to believe he will not\ndispatch pursuit ships to destroy us. Our only chance is to be too far\naway for them to catch up with us. At least in Terrestrial ships. By\nthe time Sirenian designs are built, we must have an answer.\n\n\"That, then, is the nature of the problem we face. Our one hope--and\nit is a slim one--appears to be the discovery of the weapon by which\nthe Dragbora overpowered the Sirenian hordes long ago. If we remain\nlimited by the range of our own science, I am convinced the problem is\nhopeless, though I'm aware that happily there are those of you whose\nminds differ radically from mine and would not admit defeat even with\nsuch limitations.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Some of you had objections to our flight, arguing that we should\nremain and conduct an underground opposition movement. You were those\nwho lacked a correct evaluation of our enemy. I want you to understand\nthat such a movement would have been absolutely futile. A successful\nunderground movement must be that of an oppressed majority against a\nminority of ruling numbers. Humanity _wants_ Demarzule. Never forget\nit. That is why we are fleeing.\n\n\"But our battle is not with our fellow men; their faults are rooted in\nthe dark processes of evolution and racial development. The appearance\nof Demarzule is an extraneous factor, however, one that evolution\ndid not allow for. Without him, men would eventually attain maturity\nand balance out of the conflicts of their racial adolescence. With\nDemarzule as god and leader, generations of development may be wiped\nout.\n\n\"You must remember that we have committed ourselves to the only\npossible course--escape. We're nothing but children beside the racially\nold Demarzule. He's a superman from a super-race that outstripped ours\nlong before our first cave ancestor discovered fire. Let us hope that\nwe find the weapon of the Dragbora, so our kind may climb the long\nevolutionary ladder upon which they have stumbled so sorely.\"\n\nAfter Dreyer's speech it was a solemn group of men that faced\nUnderwood. The semanticist had conveyed for the first time to most of\nthem the immensity of the threat that confronted them.\n\nThey proceeded then with the organizing of the large group into smaller\nunits according to their specialties. Underwood found there was a\npreponderance of physicists and biologists. The thirty physicists\nwere grouped under the leadership of Mason. To them went the task of\ninvestigating the possible weapons and defenses which could be employed\nagainst the attacks that would certainly come.\n\nThe men with strictly engineering qualifications were assigned to work\nwith Mason's group.\n\nThe biological group included a dozen surgeons and four psychiatrists\nunder Illia's leadership. Dreyer and his fellow semanticists were\nassigned with the archeologists to examine the records they had\nsalvaged from the fire in the hopes of finding a clue to the Dragboran\nworld and the weapon that might be there.\n\nMost of the physical scientists had varying degrees of skill with\nmachine tools and equipment and could assist in the fabrication of\narmaments for the ship.\n\nThe first task was to rig the ship with absorbing screens to prevent\nradar echoes and nullify this means of locating them from Earth. It\nwas a relatively easy project and one that was completed by the end of\ntheir first twenty-four hours in space. That left only astronomical\nmeans by which they could be detected from Earth, and with each passing\nhour, this possibility became more remote. Underwood, however, could\nnot put off the uneasiness that beset him in the face of the pursuit he\nknew must surely come.\n\nSix days out and a hundred thousand light years from Earth, Phyfe\nuncovered the first evidence that fortune was with them.\n\nHe and Dreyer, along with Terry and Underwood and the other\nsemanticists and archeologists, were working in the single large\nchamber allotted to study of the records. Phyfe's sudden exclamation\nburst upon the silence of the room. He held up a small metal roll,\nfused on the outside, but unrolled in a spiral coil where he had\nbroken the fused portions away.\n\n\"This looks as if it might have been the log of one of the refugee\nships,\" he said. \"Look at it.\"\n\nUnderwood bent over the small machine they had devised for supplying\nthe correction radiation which would render the characters visible.\nNormally, they stood out against their dull, metallic background like\nwhite fire, but these were dim almost to the point of obliteration. He\nread slowly, aloud.\n\n\"Meathes. 2192903. One _detela_ since leaving Sirenia. Lookout reports\nDragboran vessels within range. A thousand of them, which means we are\noutnumbered ten to one. Flight bearings 3827--\"\n\nUnderwood looked up. He could read no further. \"Those last figures--\"\n\n\"Could they be the relationship between his own fleet and the home\nplanet?\" said Phyfe.\n\n\"More likely it would be the bearings of the Dragboran fleet in\nrelation to the Sirenians. In any case, such figures would be a clue\nto the location of the worlds, because they would be related to\ntheir Galactic references. That's the catch, though, finding those\nreferences. To us, they would be entirely arbitrary. But if this is a\nlog, it may give the location of the planets and their Galaxy that we\ncan identify. If we can work out the changes in astronomical positions\nthat take place in five hundred thousand years.\"\n\nHe took the roll from the machine and examined it more closely. \"It's\nalmost hopeless to get any more out of this. Is there any other\nspecimen that was found in the same locality?\"\n\nPhyfe checked the records and shook his head. \"This was found stuck to\na completely fused mass of iron, apparently part of the ship in which\nit lay when the Dragbora struck. We may as well send it to the lab for\nrestoration. If it becomes possible to read it, it may help.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn four hours the duplicate record came back, restored as completely\nas possible, but there were long blanks which were un-intelligible.\nUnderwood turned up the maximum radiation which helped bring out the\ncharacters, but also burned them rapidly away if left on too long.\nSuddenly he caught his breath.\n\n\"Listen to this: 'Our bearings are now 6749367 Sirenia, having traveled\n84 _tre-doma_, Sirenia. In two _te-ela_ we land. Perhaps for the last\ntime--'\"\n\n\"That's it!\" Phyfe exclaimed.\n\n\"All but the key to their co-ordinate system,\" said Underwood. \"Do you\nsee any possibility of interpreting it, Dreyer?\"\n\nThe semanticist shook his head. \"It must be based upon entirely\narbitrary reference points as ours is. I see no hope of interpretation\nwith the figures we now have. Perhaps our astronomers could suggest\nsomething.\"\n\nMasterson and Ebert, the two astronomers included in the group, were\ncalled in from their task of preparing star charts of the Universe of\nhalf a million years ago. They considered the facts Underwood presented.\n\nMasterson said, \"I'm afraid the bearings given by the Sirenians won't\nbe much help. The distance is of value. That shows us that we have a\nshell at a radial distance of approximately ninety million light years\nfrom the Solar System. At best, then, we have this shell, which may be\nconsidered as several thousand light years thick, in which to search.\nIf we could find even approximately the proper sector of this shell, we\nmight soon isolate the possible planetary systems to which the Dragbora\nand Sirenians belonged, but without being able to narrow down the\npossible sectors of that shell, it becomes an impossible task. Just a\nsingle reference to some Island Universe that we might identify would\ndo it, perhaps.\"\n\nUnderwood and Dreyer had to agree. They had gained something; if they\ncould just obtain one more scrap of astronomical information, it might\ngive them the key.\n\nThe search for that key went on among the records and artifacts. The\nrepository itself was searched inch by inch--and still almost none of\nthe artifacts found there could be identified or explained. Apart from\nthe repository, most of the material they had was native to the planet\non which the Sirenians landed.\n\nBy the eighth day Mason's crew had managed to construct equipment\nfor throwing a force shell about the _Lavoisier_, and Underwood\nbreathed considerably easier. They could travel indefinitely behind\nthe protection of that impenetrable shield. Data for navigation was\nobtained through almost infinitesimal pilot units set outside the shell\nand connected through hair-fine leads running through equally small\nholes in it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUnderwood was proud of this accomplishment. With their limited\nfacilities for manufacture, it was little short of a miracle that they\nhad been able to turn out the mass of complex equipment in so short a\ntime. Somehow, it seemed symbolic to him, as if there were definite\nlaws favoring their success--the success of Earth.\n\nAnd then on that same eighth day, when they were almost beyond the\nlimit at which such small, dark objects could be identified, the\nlookout observer on duty sounded a warning to the control center.\n\n\"Fleet departing from Earth. Twenty warships. Corius type. Apparent\ncourse 169 46 12 and 48 19 06. Velocity--\"\n\nUnderwood looked at Phyfe, who was beside him at the time. \"This is\nit,\" he said.\n\nThe warning went throughout the ship and the men looked up from their\ntasks a moment, then resumed with grimmer eyes and firmer mouths.\nMason's group was working on the problem that had baffled armament men\nfor generations, the problem of firing the Atom Stream through the\nforce shell. Underwood had little confidence that they would solve the\nproblem, but as it was they had no offense whatever.\n\nAs Underwood and Phyfe moved to the navigator's table to check their\ncourse and that of the pursuing fleet, he said, \"I wonder how they\nspotted us. Our echo screen couldn't have broken down. It must have\nbeen sheer astronomical luck that put them on our trail.\"\n\nLieutenant Wilson, the navigator, frowned as he pointed to their\ncourse charts. \"I don't believe that fleet is following us,\" he said.\n\"If they are, they're going the long way around, because their course\nat present is heading more than fourteen degrees from ours.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPhyfe and Underwood studied the trajectories, projecting them into\nspace, estimating the rate at which the fleet would approach,\nconsidering its superior velocity and the divergent courses.\n\n\"It's easy enough to determine whether they're following or not,\"\nsaid Underwood. \"We could simply change our own course by ninety\ndegrees. Perhaps they haven't detected us after all, but are merely\nshooting blind in the general direction we might be, based only on the\nobservations of the police as we took off. In that case, they may hope\nmerely to approach near enough to obtain adequate radar echoes.\"\n\nDreyer had heard the news over the interphone and came into the\nnavigation cell. He overheard Underwood's last statement.\n\n\"Demarzule would not send out a mere fishing expedition,\" he said\nflatly.\n\n\"Then what's the answer?\" Underwood asked, but in his own mind he was\nevolving a wild theory. He wondered if Dreyer would confirm it.\n\n\"If we were merely going blindly into space to escape, Demarzule would\nhave no concern with us, but if we were going to a destination where\nour arrival would be malevolent to him--then he would be concerned.\"\n\nUnderwood's eyes lighted. He read in Dreyer's face the same conclusions\nhe had reached.\n\n\"And Demarzule would send his fleet not after us particularly, but to\nthat destination to see that we didn't reach it. Therefore, this fleet\nis headed for the Dragboran world!\"\n\n\"Not so fast!\" Phyfe objected. \"Demarzule would be assuming that we\nknow where it is. He has no basis for such an assumption.\"\n\nDreyer shook his head. \"He doesn't know whether we know the way or not.\nHe knows only that it must be guarded from any possible exploitation by\nus. If we don't go there, we are no menace to him. If we do, the fleet\nis there to take care of us.\"\n\nPhyfe considered, then slowly nodded. \"You're right.\"\n\n\"And Demarzule is going to show us the way to the Dragboran weapon!\"\nsaid Underwood fiercely.\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER ELEVEN_\n\n\nThe course was changed so that the flight of the _Lavoisier_ paralleled\nthat of the Terrestrian fleet. The acceleration was increased to a\ntwenty per cent overload of the inertia units, making it necessary for\neach man to use a small carrier unit against his own increased weight.\n\nStill the fleet crept up, lessening the distance between them, but\nUnderwood felt confident that the distance between their parallel\ncourses was great enough to prevent detection by any means the\nfleet could mount.\n\nThere was new life in the ship as the working and sleeping periods\npassed rapidly. It was easier to concentrate on their work now that\neveryone felt he was heading toward a definite goal--they dared not\ndoubt that that goal would yield what they hoped from it.\n\nUnder Phyfe's direction, daily classes in Sirenian culture were held.\nEvery fact of existence they tried to view from the Sirenian viewpoint\nand anticipate its semantic significance to that ancient conquering\nrace.\n\nThe trip was estimated at approximately three months. A little\nimpromptu party was held when the fleet passed them near the halfway\nmark. From then on it was a desperate race to see that the other ships\ndidn't get out of range of the instruments of the _Lavoisier_.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the last week of the third month, a sudden, sharp deceleration\nwas observed in the ships of the battle fleet. Underwood alerted his\nentire crew. If their deductions had been right, they were within a few\nhundred thousand light years of the Dragboran world.\n\nAs the _Lavoisier_ braked some of its tremendous velocity by the\nopening of the entropy dissipators, the fleet appeared heading for a\nsmall galaxy with a group of yellow stars near its outer rim.\n\nUnderwood allowed their ship to close somewhat the enormous gap between\nthem and the enemy, but he wanted to maintain a reasonable distance,\nfor the fleet would certainly begin to sweep-search the skies of the\nalien planet when they arrived and found the _Lavoisier_ had not landed.\n\nThe fleet was finally observed to close in upon one of the yellow suns\nwhich had a system of five planets. It was the fourth planet toward\nwhich the fleet drove. Underwood watched six of the twenty ships land\nupon it.\n\n\"Let's line up behind one of the other planets,\" he instructed Dawson.\n\"The second appears closest. Then we can swing over and come in behind\nthe moon of number four. We'll probably land on that moon and look the\nfleet over before deciding our next action.\"\n\nThe only disadvantage in the maneuver was that they could not keep a\nsufficiently close check on the fleet. They came out of the shadow of\nthe planet for two hours and then were eclipsed by the moon of the\nfourth planet. During that interval they were in the light of the sun,\nand they saw no evidence of the fleet at all. The photographers busied\nthemselves with taking pictures of the Dragboran world.\n\nLike the second planet, the moon appeared to be a barren sphere at\nfirst glance, but as they approached and moved farther around its\nsix-thousand-mile circumference, they found an area of lush vegetation\noccupying about an eighth of the surface.\n\nIt was the night side at the moment of their approach. No sign of\nhabitation was apparent, though Underwood thought for an instant he\nglimpsed a smoke column spiraling upward in the night as they dropped\nto the surface. Then it was gone, and he was not sure that he had\nreally seen anything.\n\nThe _Lavoisier_ came to rest on the grassy floor of a clearing in the\nvegetated corner of the otherwise barren world.\n\nAt that instant Mason came into the control room. \"I don't know what\nyou expect to find on that planet down there,\" he said. He handed a\nbatch of photos to Underwood. \"We must have pulled a boner somewhere.\"\n\nUnderwood felt a sting of apprehension. \"Why? What's the matter?\"\n\n\"If there's any habitation there, it's under bottles. There isn't a\nspeck of atmosphere on the whole planet.\"\n\n\"That makes it definitely an archeological problem, then,\" Phyfe\nsaid. \"It was too much to hope that an advanced civilization like\nthe Dragboran could have existed another half million years. But the\nphotos--what do they show?\"\n\nHe glanced over Underwood's arm. \"There are cities! No question that\nthe planet was once inhabited. But it looks as if it had only been\nyesterday that those cities had been occupied!\"\n\n\"That would be explained by the absence of atmosphere,\" said Underwood.\n\"The cities would not be buried under drifted mounds in an airless\nworld. Some great cataclysm must have removed both atmosphere and life\nfrom the planet at the same time. Perhaps our problem is easier, rather\nthan more difficult, because of this. If the destruction occurred\nreasonably soon after the Dragbora defeated the Sirenians, there may be\nample evidence of their weapons among the ruins.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs Dreyer, Terry, and Illia drifted into the control room after the\nlanding, an impromptu war council was held.\n\n\"We'll have to wait until the fleet gives up and goes back,\" said\nTerry. \"We can't hope to go in and blast them out of the way.\"\n\n\"How do we know they'll give up?\" asked Illia. \"They may be a permanent\nguard.\"\n\n\"We don't know what they will do,\" said Underwood. \"They might stay for\nmonths, anyway, and that is too long for us to wait. Even twenty ships\nare not a large force on a planet of that size. My plan is to make a\nnight landing in some barren area, then advance slowly up to one of the\nlarger cities and hide the ship. We can make explorations by means of\nscooter to determine if any of the fleet is in the city. If so, we can\nmove on; if not, we can begin searching. It makes no difference where\nwe begin until we get some kind of idea of the history and culture of\nthe Dragbora.\"\n\n\"It's so hopeless!\" Phyfe shook his head fiercely. \"It would be a\nproject for a thousand archeologists for a hundred years to examine and\nanalyze such ruins as those down there, yet a hundred of us propose\nto do it in weeks--hiding from a deadly enemy at the same time! It's\nutterly impossible.\"\n\n\"I don't think so,\" said Underwood. \"We are searching only for one\nthing. We know it is a weapon. It is not unreasonable to believe there\nmight be wide reference to it in the writings and history of the\nDragbora, since it was the means of destroying their rival empire. The\nonly real difficulty is with the fleet, but I think we can work under\ntheir noses for a long enough time.\"\n\n\"You're an incurable optimist,\" said Terry.\n\n\"So are the rest of you, or you'd never have come on this trip.\"\n\n\"I'm agreeable,\" said Illia. \"There's only one thing I'd like to\nsuggest. If this moon is at all habitable, I think we should take a day\nor two off and stretch our legs outside in some sunshine.\"\n\nThere was no objection to that.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDawn on the moon of the Dragboran world almost corresponded with the\nend of their sleeping period. Analysis was made of conditions outside.\nThe atmosphere proved suitable, though thin. The outside temperature\nappeared high, as was expected from their proximity to the sun.\n\nThen, as Underwood ordered the force shell lifted and opened the port,\nhe received a shock of surprise that made him exclaim aloud. Illia, not\nfar behind, came running.\n\n\"What is it, Del?\"\n\nHis finger was pointing down toward a group of figures at the base of\nthe ship. They were quite human in appearance--in the same way that\nDemarzule had been. Taller than the Earthmen, and copper-skinned, they\nwatched the opening of the port and bowed low before Underwood and\nIllia.\n\nThere were four of them standing, and they were grouped about a fifth\nfigure lying on a litter.\n\n\"Maybe we ought to forget about leaving the ship,\" said Underwood\ndoubtfully. \"There's no use getting tangled up with superstitious\nnatives. We haven't time for that.\"\n\n\"No, wait, Del. That one on the litter is hurt,\" said Illia. \"I believe\nthey've brought him here to see us. Maybe we can do something for him.\"\n\nUnderwood knew it was no use trying to oppose her desire to help. He\nsaid, \"Let's get Dreyer. He may be able to talk with them.\"\n\nDreyer and Phyfe and Nichols were already coming toward the port\ntogether. They were excited by Underwood's report.\n\n\"This may be an offshoot of either the Dragboran or Sirenian\ncivilization,\" said Phyfe. \"In either case we may find something useful\nto us.\"\n\n\"They think we're gods. They want us to cure one of their injured,\"\nsaid Underwood. \"We can't hope for anything useful in a society as\nprimitive as that.\"\n\nThe semanticists looked out at the small group. Suddenly, Dreyer\nuttered sounds that resembled a series of grunts with changing\ninflections. One of the natives, a woman, rose and presented a long\nspeech wholly meaningless to Underwood. But Dreyer stood with strained\nattention, as if comprehending with difficulty every meaning in that\nalien tongue.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen Underwood recalled hearing of Dreyer's statement that a true\nsemanticist should be able to understand and converse in any alien\nlanguage the first time he heard it. In all languages there are sounds\nand intonations that have fundamental and identical semantic content.\nThese, Dreyer asserted, could be identified and used in reconstructing\nthe language in a ready flow of conversation if one were skillful\nenough. Underwood had always believed it was nothing but a boast, but\nnow he was seeing it in action.\n\nThe two women of the group and one of the men seemed utterly lost in\ntheir attitude of worship, but the other figure, standing a little\napart, seemed almost rebellious in appearance. He spoke abruptly and at\nlittle length.\n\n\"That fellow is a healthy skeptic,\" said Dreyer. \"He's willing to\naccept us as gods, but he wants proof that we are. He's liable to play\ntricks to find out.\"\n\n\"We can't bother with them,\" said Underwood. \"There's nothing here for\nus.\"\n\n\"There may be,\" said Dreyer. \"We should let Illia see what she can do.\"\n\nUnderwood did not press his protests. He allowed Dreyer to direct the\nnatives to bring their companion into the ship. There, in the surgery,\nIllia examined the injuries. The injured one appeared aged, but there\nwas a quality of joyousness and exuberance in his countenance that\nUnderwood found himself almost envying.\n\nBut Illia was shaking her head. \"It's hopeless,\" she said. \"There's\nnothing we can do for him.\"\n\nShe turned on the fluoroscope for Underwood to see. He moved it about,\nthen exclaimed, \"Illia! Those strange organs below the diaphragm--\"\n\nShe caught her breath sharply. \"The same as in Demarzule. These must be\nof the same race!\"\n\nDreyer was speaking to the companions of the injured one, explaining\nthat it was impossible to save the life of the aged man.\n\nThe response of the rebellious one was an almost savage growl in his\nthroat. He spoke then more softly to the injured one, as if explaining.\nThe serene countenance did not change, but the eyes closed quietly, and\nthe Earthmen knew that he was dead.\n\nSwiftly, the rebellious one drew a knife of glass from a sheath and\nslashed with careless skill at the corpse. He extracted one of the\nalien organs and placed it in a container which he carried. With no\nother word, he left, and the two women followed sorrowfully and more\nslowly. They refused to speak further.\n\nUnderwood watched them go. \"We seem to have gained a corpse,\" he said.\n\"Get a couple of the men to take it out and bury it, will you, Terry?\nI wonder what the whole thing means, anyway. Are these remnants of\nSirenian culture?\"\n\nHis speculations were suddenly interrupted by the blaring of the\ninterphone. \"Doctor Underwood, lookout reports entire Terrestrian fleet\ndeparting from the Dragboran planet!\"\n\nThe group in surgery looked at each other in sudden silence.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"It doesn't make sense,\" Terry said finally.\n\n\"It does,\" said Underwood slowly. \"If they have found and destroyed\nwhat we hoped to find.\"\n\n\"Also if they wanted to draw us out of hiding,\" added Dreyer.\n\n\"We'd better wait a couple of days and see what they do. If they seem\nto be intent on continuing their flight, we can move to the planet with\nthe sun behind us and they won't detect it. But I think that we should\nwait the two days at least, so if one wants to do any looking around on\nthis moon, there's his chance.\"\n\nTerry was enthusiastic about exploring the moon. It seemed that here\nmight be a living fragment of a civilization thousands of years old,\nwhich should have been long dead in the normal course of events, but\nwhich had somehow survived the catastrophes that wiped out the parent\ncivilizations.\n\nIllia too, was anxious to get away from the ship. Together, they\npersuaded Underwood to join them in a scooter exploration of the\nsurrounding territory. Phyfe and Dreyer were going, but it was\nnecessary for Mason to remain in technical command at the ship.\n\nBeyond the grassy plain lay a thickly forested section. The scooter\nparty rose high into the air to clear the wooded area and were lost to\nthe view of those aboard the _Lavoisier_.\n\nFor a long time they rode at treetop level, looking beyond toward the\nbarren sand wastes that touched the far horizon.\n\nSuddenly Terry pointed downward. \"A road!\"\n\nA shimmering belt ran through the forest almost at right angles to\ntheir line of flight. They dropped into the sylvan canyon to examine\nit. Underwood halted just above the surface. Then he leaned over and\ntouched it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDreyer looked at his puzzled face without halting the column of cigar\nsmoke. \"Glass, eh?\"\n\n\"Looks and feels like it, but a glass highway--!\"\n\n\"Limitation of materials,\" said Dreyer. \"The moon obviously is\nlacking in mineral resources, being composed chiefly of nonmetallic\nsilicates. The glass knife our friend used on the corpse indicates\nmetal starvation; this highway clinches it because it shows they\nhave a highly developed technology of glass-working. Therefore, we\nare very definitely not in the presence of a primitive civilization\nas we supposed. We'd better watch our step because our friend seemed\ndisillusioned about our failure to save his injured companion.\"\n\nThey chose a direction along the highway and pursued it a few feet\nabove the surface. They traveled for twenty minutes or so with no break\nin the forest about them or the shining highway below.\n\nThen abruptly a figure came into view in the distance. It was moving\nrapidly. Terry squinted and suddenly exclaimed, \"We come how many light\nyears to find a super-civilization, and we find bike riders!\"\n\nPhyfe said, \"I don't see anything strange in it. Certainly the bicycle\nis an obvious mode of locomotion in a moderately mechanical culture. It\nmay or may not imply a lack of self-propelled mechanisms.\"\n\n\"Recognize that fellow?\" asked Underwood.\n\nThey drifted forward as the rider approached rapidly. Finally they\ncould see his features plainly and recognized him as the rebellious one\nof their morning encounter.\n\n\"I wonder if he is on his way back to see us again,\" said Terry.\n\n\"Our meeting is fortunate,\" said Dreyer. \"I want to know what he did\nwith that organ he removed from the corpse. I've never come across\nanything quite like that in all my ethnological studies. I suspect it\nmay be some rite associated with the belief in that organ as the seat\nof life, just as the heart was once regarded among us.\"\n\nThey slowed as they came to the man--for so they had come to think of\nhim in their own minds. He halted also and regarded them balefully.\nThen furious speech came to his lips. \"_Shazer na jourli!_\"\n\nDreyer frowned and muttered a few syllables slowly. The stranger\nrepeated the furious assertion.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"He says that we are not gods,\" said Dreyer.\n\n\"We could have told him that much,\" said Underwood drily.\n\nThe conversation in the unknown tongue continued until Dreyer turned\nagain to his companions. \"The fellow calls himself Jandro, and the fact\nthat we have metals still doesn't convince him that we are gods, an\nopinion which contradicts those of his fellows. Does that make sense to\nyou?\"\n\nPhyfe exclaimed, \"It makes wonderful sense! A planet devoid of metals,\nyet inhabited by a highly intelligent race. They make the best possible\ntechnological use of materials at their command, but they know somehow\nof the existence and properties of metals. What is more natural than\nfor them to build a religion about the more fortunate metal-using\ngods?\"\n\nDreyer said to Jandro, \"We are not gods. We did not come to you as\ngods, but as visitors. We are from a place called Earth.\"\n\nThe admission seemed a great shock to Jandro, for his expression\nchanged markedly. \"I am sorry,\" he said, \"if I have accused you of a\nclaim you have not made. But I do not understand what you say. If you\ncome from the Heaven World, take me there and help me return with the\nsecrets to lift my people.\"\n\n\"Heaven World?\" Dreyer frowned.\n\nJandro pointed toward the horizon where the planet of the Dragbora hung\nlike a silver disk.\n\n\"Why do you call it Heaven World?\"\n\nJandro looked up with both longing and bitterness before he spoke. \"You\ndid not come from there?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"But you can go there in your metal?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Will you take me?\"\n\n\"That is not for me to say, but perhaps I can influence the others.\nTell me why you want to go and why you call it Heaven World.\"\n\n\"Long ago,\" said Jandro, \"before men lived on Trear, they lived with\nthe gods on Heaven World, but for rebellion and disobedience they\nwere thrown down and exiled. Trear was a barren moon without life or\nmaterials. After many _dekara_ man succeeded in expanding the tiny\nseeds of life he had brought and grew the great forests. That gave us\nwood, and the deserts gave us glass. So we have built a world on the\nbarren Trear, and have looked to the time when the gods shall lift us\nagain to Heaven World.\n\n\"That is the story the fathers have told, but I do not believe it,\"\nJandro finished. \"I do not know what to believe, except that I want the\nheritage of our home world to be restored to us.\"\n\nDreyer related the story to his companions. \"It sounds very much as if\nJandro's ancestors were some refugee group that fled the planet before\nthe destruction that consumed the atmosphere.\"\n\n\"So he wants to go with us,\" Underwood said. \"I wonder if he could be\nof any use to us in unraveling the secrets of the planet.\"\n\n\"I'd like to use the request to bargain with him,\" said Dreyer. \"I very\nmuch want to know why he cut out that organ and what he did with it.\nThat surgical skill he exhibited didn't come instinctively.\"\n\n\"It's all right with me,\" assented Underwood.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDreyer addressed Jandro again. \"It is that you may go to the planet\nwith us. There's only one thing we'd like in return--information as to\nwhy you opened the corpse and removed the organ.\"\n\n\"For the _discara_, of course. Oh! You mean you wish to present the\napologetics?\" Sudden expressions of understanding and of extreme\npuzzlement conflicted on his face.\n\nDreyer fumbled an instant. \"The apologetics? Yes, of course! We wish to\npresent the apologetics.\"\n\n\"Very well. You are guests of my house. My father will be pleased.\"\n\nJandro wheeled his bicycle about and sped down the road. Dreyer told\nthe others what had happened and set his scooter in motion in the\ndirection taken by the stranger.\n\nTerry was explosive in comment. \"What the devil are the apologetics?\"\nhe demanded. \"We don't know how to offer them or who to offer them to.\nYou're going to get us in a jam if we poke into the religious rites of\nthese amateur surgeons!\"\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER TWELVE_\n\n\nUnderwood speculated about Dreyer. Behind the passive exterior of the\nman was a brain whose incessant activity often flowed in the most\ndevious channels. What motivated this interest in the peculiarities of\nthe alien culture? Underwood was sure there was more than appeared on\nthe surface.\n\nThere was the fact that every organ presents a vulnerable point to the\nproper weapon. Was it Dreyer's idea to determine the properties of the\nunknown organs in the hope of finding weapons to which they would be\nvulnerable?\n\nThe forest gave way to green and they were in a clearing that shone in\nthe sunlight like a pool of soap bubbles.\n\nThe houses, like the streets, were of multicolored glass that sparkled\nas if with light of their own. The Earthmen knew then for certain that\nthey were not in the presence of any primitive people, for the city was\narranged with the artistry of a giant crown of jewels.\n\nThere were many of the tall, copper people in the streets and in the\nparkways. Seeing them together in their own setting, Underwood was\nimpressed with their grace and simple beauty. Serenity and contentment\nwere in their features and in the grace of their carriage.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Earthmen, astride the scooters, riding mysteriously above the\nsurface of the road, soon attracted attention. Cries rose into the air,\nand scores of the people prostrated themselves in the road.\n\nJandro stopped and motioned the men to halt. Then he addressed his\npeople in speech that was too rapid even for Dreyer's understanding.\nDreyer managed to glean only that Jandro was saying the men had come to\noffer the apologetics to his father and that Jandro had been chosen to\ngo to Heaven World for his people.\n\nThere were some who seemed to regard Jandro with astonished disbelief,\nand others who bowed before him as before the Earthmen. But when the\ngroup began moving forward again, the people rose and stood in silence\nand awe.\n\nThey stopped before a large, one-story cube of orange hue. Jandro\ndismounted and stood aside for them to enter.\n\n\"You do my house honor,\" he said.\n\nUnderwood strained to pick up some of the language, but he could only\nguess at it. Phyfe and Terry Bernard were getting much of it, but not\nwith Dreyer's facility. The semanticist walked toward the building\nconfidently, then stopped at the entrance and regarded his cigar\ndoubtfully. It was impossible to toss it aside upon the immaculate\ngardens or walkways. He finally put it out against his shoe and stuffed\nthe shredded remains in his pocket.\n\nThe interior of the house was fitted with simple luxury. Abundant light\nstreamed from colored prisms which brought in flooding beams of natural\nlight from outside the decoratively translucent panels that formed the\nwalls.\n\nAlmost at once, two others, women, entered from the opposite doorway\ninto the room. One was elderly, but the other was younger than Jandro\nin appearance.\n\nThen the Earthmen recognized them--the same who had been at the ship\nwith Jandro that morning.\n\nThey gave involuntary cries at the sight of the Earthmen. Quickly,\nJandro explained their presence and their denial of being gods.\nGradually, the excitement of the two women abated and Jandro introduced\nthem to Dreyer, who relayed the introductions.\n\n\"They will prepare our meal before we go,\" said Jandro, \"but now you\nwish you view my father's _discara_ and offer the apologetics. Come\nthis way.\"\n\nHe led the way through the house to another room with a closed door.\nEven Dreyer's calm was deserting him as he wondered what would happen\nif he could not grasp instantly what was expected of him.\n\nJandro suddenly flung the door wide and ushered them in. \"You will wish\nto be alone,\" he said. \"I will await you.\"\n\nHe closed the door.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNone of them had any preconceived idea of what they might see, nor\ncould they have imagined the sight that met their eyes. The room was\nlarge and the walls were lined with shelves from floor to ceiling, like\na fantastic library.\n\nIt was the objects on those shelves that held their attention. Square\nglass jars, completely identical, filled the spaces, and in each jar\nwas a reddish-brown organ exactly like that taken from the corpse\naboard their ship by Jandro. A clear, transparent preservative liquid\nsurrounded the specimens, and the containers were sealed.\n\nBut in a small space before them a table stood, and on it rested a\nsingle jar with a fresh-looking specimen. Instinctively, they knew it\nwas the one they had seen excised that morning.\n\nTerry expelled a lungful of air. \"Well, this _is_ something. A morgue\nfor extinct livers, kept by an amateur surgeon who rides a bike to\nwork. What the devil do you make of it?\"\n\nIllia was examining the specimens closely. \"All of them weren't as good\nsurgeons as Jandro. Most of these look as if they'd been out with a\nmeat axe. Some of them look as if they've been here since the beginning\nof time.\"\n\n\"Some sort of ancestor worship,\" said Underwood. \"The apologetics must\nbe some form of social rite offered to the ancestors of a friend, all\nof it interesting but quite useless for our purposes at the moment.\"\n\n\"It's not that simple,\" said the semanticist. \"Consider the fact that\neven though Jandro understands we are from another world, he believes\nus familiar with all of this. He therefore believes these things\nfamiliar to all humanoid beings. There could be a scientifically valid\nreason behind it.\"\n\n\"What?\" said Underwood.\n\n\"I don't know, but I'm going to find out.\"\n\nJandro was waiting for them when they emerged. He showed them to the\ntable where a meal was prepared and waiting.\n\nFor Underwood and Illia it was a strange meal, for they could not\ncommunicate with their hosts in the slightest degree. Phyfe and Terry\nwere entering gradually into the interchange.\n\nThere was awkwardness due to the oversize furniture and eating\nequipment, but tolerant allowances were made on both sides. The two\nwomen had difficulty in dropping their stiff reserve, but by the end of\nthe meal they seemed to have forgotten that the men were anything but\nold acquaintances in for a visit.\n\nIt was then that Jandro said, \"I suppose you would like to see our\n_resa_ and the installation of the _abasa_?\"\n\nWithout a sign of incomprehension, Dreyer repeated the question.\n\n\"I'm willing to see anything there is to see,\" said Underwood. Though\nhe was restless, he knew they must give more time for the Terrestrian\nfleet to get away.\n\nThey left the house and crossed the city afoot, Jandro leading the way\ntoward one of the major jewels in that sparkling city. It was a large\nbuilding of blood-red glass standing apart from other structures.\n\n\"I should have explained,\" said Jandro. \"This is where my duties are\nperformed. I am an installer. Today I am not working, but operations\nare being performed, so that you will be able to witness our methods\nas well as the mother-flesh of the _abasa_.\"\n\nHe led them through the winding corridors of the magnificent structure\nof glass. By some means, Underwood observed, the glistening floors\nhad a high friction co-efficient without losing any of their sheen.\nAbruptly, they came into a chamber that formed a small amphitheater,\nsimilar in some respects to the operating amphitheaters of Terrestrian\nhospitals. With something of a shock, they discovered that was exactly\nwhat it was.\n\nThey took seats by the protective railing. Below them, on a table\nwhere a pair of surgeons worked, an infant lay with a large abdominal\nincision. One of the surgeons lifted a small, fleshy object from a\nnearby bath and skillfully inserted it through the incision. They\nwatched in spell-bound amazement as the organ was sutured into place,\ntiny blood vessels were spliced and nerves from adjacent organs were\nslit and led into the new mass.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIllia clutched Underwood's arm. She whispered, \"They're _grafting_ in\nthose strange organs we haven't identified. They aren't born with them\nat all!\"\n\n\"But where do they get them?\" Terry muttered. \"Maybe that's why they\ntake them out after death--to use them over again. But that couldn't\nbe because they pickle them. I give up. This is too much for me.\"\n\nIllia's eyes were only for the skilled hands below that were working\nsuch miracles with living tissue. Once she looked aside at the calm\nfeatures of Jandro and recalled his passing remark that he was an\n\"installer.\" If this was the sort of thing he did, he could stand with\nthe greatest of Earth's surgeons.\n\nThe operation was a long one. When the two surgeons finally closed the\nincision, they began a similar operation at the base of the brain,\ngrafting in a fragment of shapeless flesh there.\n\nThe Earthmen could not comprehend how the infant could stand the shock\nof such radical surgery, yet if they were to believe the evidence, this\nwas performed on every child born on the moon.\n\nJandro said, \"You have seen our technique. How does it compare with\nyours?\"\n\nDreyer nodded noncommittally. \"Very similar, except that we have found\nit advisable to delay the brain operation. It relieves shock and\nappears to help recovery.\"\n\n\"The _tri-abasa_, you mean? So that is the explanation. I will be\nfrank. I've been attempting to detect your _epthalia_ since your\narrival. I have wondered about your reasons for concealment, but of\ncourse that is your own concern. It seemed impossible, however, that\nyou should prevent me from detecting.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Dreyer replied sagely. He reported the double talk to his\ncompanions. \"I don't think we can keep this up much longer, and I don't\nbelieve it would be a good idea to disclose our lack of these organs.\nJandro assumes all humanoid life requires it. He would be likely to\nconsider us sub-human if he knew.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUnderwood nodded. \"Tell him we'll be on our way, then.\"\n\nIt had been fruitless, he thought. He didn't know what Dreyer had\nexpected of their diversionary visit among these people, but as far as\nUnderwood could see it had accomplished nothing. He had become rather\nattracted to Jandro, however, in their few hours together, recognizing\nin him something of the same rebellion against the conventions of\nhis world that Underwood felt on Earth. Perhaps, on the trip to the\nDragboran planet, they could become acquainted.\n\nJandro led them from the chamber. \"You must see the mother-flesh. It\nwill only take a few moments. It has never once died, and now is far\nolder than our historical records.\"\n\nThe Earthmen followed through the winding corridors again to a door\nthat opened only after a complicated code system, and then by being\ndrawn wholly inward. As they walked through the opening, they observed\nthe walls were nearly four feet thick, of solid glass of a lead-gray\nhue.\n\n\"The protection is necessary to guard the mother-flesh against natural\ndisturbances and the occasional unfortunates among us whose will is to\ndestroy. No force of which we are aware could penetrate the barrier.\"\n\nUnderwood's interest was aroused concerning the nature of this\nmysterious mother-flesh. He suspected the meaning of the name, but the\nnature of the substance was impossible to guess at.\n\nThe room into which they came was very large and equipped as a\nlaboratory, with wooden and glass instruments on every side.\n\nThe central feature of the room, however, was a large, dome-covered\ncontainer about twenty feet in diameter. Inside it, rising about\nhalfway to the top, was a shapeless mass of flesh, grayish for the most\npart, but shot through with livid streaks of red. It pulsed as if some\nquiescent, sleeping life possessed it.\n\n\"This is our mother-flesh,\" said Jandro.\n\nIllia shuddered faintly at the sight. \"It looks almost like an enormous\ncancer,\" she said.\n\nThey peered into the vat, the base of the mound of flesh being hidden\nby a thick, soupy liquid.\n\nA technician approached as they neared the dome. He carried a\nlong-handled instrument which he had just removed from a sterilizer. As\nthey watched, he opened a port in the dome and thrust the instrument\nquickly into the mound of flesh and turned it. The mass quivered and\nrecoiled, but the instrument withdrew, holding a core from deep within\nthe mass. Slowly, the wound closed and the thick, dark blood ceased\nflowing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe technician dropped the core into a container and carried it across\nthe room to one of several hundred cagelike units about a foot square.\n\n\"There you see it,\" said Jandro. \"The primeval flesh is cut out and\nplaced within its forming box where surgical manipulation and radiation\nwill cause the formation of the specialized cells that will turn it\ninto one of the three _abasa_.\"\n\n\"I'd swear that is cancerous tissue,\" said Illia. \"Whatever the purpose\nof these strange organs developed from it, it may be that these\npeople have succeeded in perfecting the mutation that nature has been\nstruggling with on Earth for thousands of generations.\"\n\n\"But what could be the purpose of it?\" Underwood demanded. \"What\nabilities do these organs give that we do not already possess? I don't\nsee any evidence in Jandro nor did I see any in Demarzule, showing the\nresults of these organs.\"\n\n\"Who knows?\" said Dreyer. \"But I believe Illia may be right. Among us,\ncancerous formation has all the appearance of a mutation gone wild, yet\nit seems to be one that nature insists on. Perhaps with Jandro aboard\nthe ship we can find out what these organs do.\"\n\nThey returned to Jandro's house. There Jandro bade good-by to his\nmother and his sister. They seemed curiously unmoved by what must be an\nevent of tremendous significance in their history, Underwood thought.\n\nJandro mounted behind Underwood on the scooter. They rose high in the\nair and set a straight course for the spot where the _Lavoisier_ lay.\nJandro gave no outward sign that such flight was unusual for him.\n\nWithin a few minutes they spotted the ship, and groups of the crew\ngathered outside, some at a distance of a mile or two. They circled and\nlanded, returned the scooters to the locks.\n\nMason came up as if greatly relieved to see them. \"The men are anxious\nto be on the way,\" he said. \"The fleet of Demarzule is definitely\nreturning to Earth, even more rapidly than they came here. There\nappears to be no more reason for delay.\"\n\nUnderwood went to the control room to check the observations. Before\nhis eyes the mighty fleet was melting into the depths of space toward\nEarth. He checked their velocity, and frowned. What purpose was there\nin this sudden retreat? Did it signify a trap that had been prepared\nfor the scientists on the Dragboran planet?\n\nThere was no way of knowing--and no way of combating the unknown.\n\nUnderwood stood up from the viewing plates and nodded. \"Let's go.\"\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER THIRTEEN_\n\n\nAs if awaiting the completion of the final step in his long journey to\ndestiny, Jandro watched the stars swing past the field of his vision as\nthe _Lavoisier_ turned sharply to get into the shadow of the planet to\nprevent observation by the fleet.\n\nUnderwood watched the alien individual, trying to fathom the mystery of\nJandro and his people. What was the truth about their myth of a fall\nfrom Heaven World, which Jandro admitted he did not believe? How had\nthe strange mass of flesh originated, from which they perpetuated the\nunknown organs within their own bodies? Underwood wondered if Illia\nwere right, if it were the harnessing of some cancerous mutation that\nhad occurred long ago in some forgotten individual and perfected for\nthe whole race.\n\nMost important of all, could Jandro and his people have any bearing\non the problem that had brought the scientists across the vastness of\nspace?\n\nTo Underwood it seemed unlikely. They had come in search of a strange\nand deadly weapon, hinted at only in scant records half a million\nyears old. Jandro's people knew nothing of the vast techniques of\nproducing metallic instruments and equipment. They were wizards in\nglass technology, and in surgery, but it was doubtful if they even knew\nof the existence of electricity.\n\nThe journey was only a matter of hours from the moon to the planet, but\nit seemed the longest part of the trip to the scientists who crowded\nabout the scanning plates turned up to their highest sensitivity.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFrom a quarter of a million miles away, the faint details of the\nancient cities began to be recognizable on the large screens. The\nsharpness with which they were revealed was awe-inspiring, for the\nairless world permitted perfect clarity of vision, and there had been\nnone of the ceaseless winds that were quick to hide the works of man\non other planets beneath dunes of sand. Here it looked as if the\ninhabitants had made a quick, orderly exodus only yesterday, leaving\nthe vast cities for whoever might want them.\n\nPhyfe was ecstatic at the sight. \"The archeologists' dream,\" he said.\n\"The perfect preservation of an ancient civilization.\"\n\n\"I can't see how the atmosphere was destroyed without considerable\neffect all over the planet,\" said Underwood. \"It doesn't seem possible.\nWait--there it is!\"\n\nOn the horizon of the world appeared a vast scar that looked as if\nit encompassed at least an eighth of the planet's surface. It looked\nrelatively shallow, though they knew it must be miles deep at the\ncenter, as if a searing torch had been touched at that one spot in a\ngreat blaze that consumed all the gases in the planet's atmosphere. For\nhundreds of miles around, the cities and plains showed evidence now of\nthe destruction. It was only on the opposite side of the planet that\nthe works of the ancient inhabitants had escaped.\n\n\"That's what did it,\" said Underwood. \"I've got an idea that we'll find\nactually few cities without considerable damage, but this is more than\nI hoped for. If there is evidence of the weapon here, we may be able to\nfind it yet.\"\n\nThey circled the planet out of sight of the departing fleet, taking\nscores of pictures of the remains below for future study. At a point\nfarthest removed from the center of destruction lay one of the largest\nof the undamaged cities. It was nearly five hundred square miles in\narea, and almost in the center of it was an area that looked as if it\nhad been a landing for ships. There, Underwood ordered the _Lavoisier_\nbrought down upon the surface of the Dragboran world.\n\nUnder their predetermined plan, Phyfe was now given charge of their\narcheological activities. He had already outlined the method of\nprocedure. They would move outward in small groups, mapping the city as\nthey went. Their initial goals would be libraries and laboratories, for\ntheir first task was to obtain command of the Dragboran language.\n\nAs Jandro looked out upon the barren planet, his face displayed its\nfirst sign of emotion. He stared at the deserted ruins and his lips\nmoved.\n\n\"Heaven World!\" he murmured.\n\nDreyer came up behind him. \"It was just a world where men lived,\" he\nsaid. \"Something happened a long time ago that made it unfit for your\npeople to live here. Some few of them apparently escaped to the moon\nand carried on your civilization. That is what is behind your legends\nof Heaven World.\"\n\nJandro nodded slowly. \"And it means that we can never possess our world\nagain. I had thought that I would lead my people back here, be the\nfirst to reclaim my heritage--and there is nothing to reclaim. Forever,\nwe shall remain in our barren moon of glass while only the ghosts of\nthe gods possess our metal Heaven World!\"\n\n\"You don't believe in the gods, and less in their ghosts,\" Dreyer\nreminded him bluntly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJandro remained facing the port without speaking.\n\nDreyer continued, \"Your people would never have followed you here even\nif the planet had been all that you dreamed. You know that, don't you?\"\n\nJandro whirled, startled, as if Dreyer had been reading his mind.\nDreyer pretended not to notice.\n\n\"In every civilization there are those who dream of better things for\nthemselves and their world. Would it help if I told you that of all the\nworlds and peoples that men have found in their wanderings in the void,\nthere are none as highly civilized as yours?\"\n\n\"A world of bits of glass?\"\n\n\"A world where the perfection of the individual is the most urgent\ncommunity enterprise. But you know all of that. Let's go out and see\nwhat your Heaven World was like when your people lived here.\"\n\nClad in spacesuits, the Earthmen began to pour out of the ship. Phyfe\nand Underwood directed the dispersal of the small exploring groups\nwho were to move radially in all directions. Though few were trained\nin the methods of archeology, they understood their objectives well\nenough to assist in the preliminary identification of specialized\ncenters and in gathering information.\n\nOne by one, the groups left the scooters soaring into the sky like\nbees swarming from a hive. Underwood chose to remain near the landing\narea with Phyfe and Terry and Dreyer. Illia and Jandro also were part\nof this group, which were to explore the buildings in the immediate\nvicinity of the landing area.\n\nUnderwood was curious about the thoughts passing through the mind of\nthe stranger as he viewed for the first time the long-dead remains of\nHeaven World. Here, where there should have been sunlight and gardens\nand life, there was only the mad contrast of blindingly bright planes\nand shadows of terrifying darkness, out of which the ghosts of the\nhalf-million-year-old dead might suddenly rise.\n\nBut since stepping out of the ship in the hastily modified suit that\nhardly accommodated his bulk, Jandro's face had taken on a look of\ninquiry and expression of expectancy, as if waiting for the Earthmen to\ndo something, yet not quite understanding their delay.\n\nUnderwood was impressed by this curious expectancy, but there were too\nmany other things to be concerned with at the moment. He drew the\nattention of the others toward an edifice that reared at least two\nthousand feet into the sky a mile beyond the landing area, but which\nwas connected with it by a long road or ramp.\n\n\"Let's have a look at that,\" he suggested.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJandro opened his lips hesitantly as if to speak, then suddenly closed\nthem tightly and a new and dreadful expression came upon his face.\nUnderwood was mystified, but dismissed the puzzle from his mind.\n\nHis eyes were upon the great structure that loomed just ahead. He\nsoared up around it. Nowhere were there windows or other openings in\nthe heights of the vast, featureless walls.\n\nHe dropped back to ground level and found his companions at the edge of\nthe enormous ramp leading down into the depths beneath the building.\n\nHe noticed there were only four of them. \"Where did Jandro go?\"\n\nTerry glanced quickly about. \"I thought he was with you.\"\n\n\"No. He probably went after something that looked familiar to him. I\nguess he can't get lost. The ship is obvious enough out there in the\ncenter of the field. Shall we see what's down here?\"\n\nDreyer pointed toward a track leading from the depths. \"It's possible\nthis is an underground hangar for their vessels, perhaps an embarkation\nstation, from which the ships were towed to the takeoff area.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUnderwood touched the controls of his scooter and led the way down the\ndecline, a scant few feet above its surface. In the field illuminated\nby the spotlight of the scooter, he could see that the opening at the\nbottom was close to a hundred and fifty feet in diameter.\n\nThe others followed cautiously down the long slope. At the bottom\nthey paused, glancing back, estimating their distance under the great\nbuilding above. Then Underwood led the way slowly forward into the\ndarkness of the ancient terminal.\n\nSuddenly, in the glare of his light, distant metallic facets reflected\nthe gleam. He went forward swiftly, swinging the light about. Then he\nrealized they were already in the center of a double row of metallic\nwalls.\n\nHe focused the light more sharply.\n\n\"Ships!\" he exclaimed. \"You were right, Dreyer. They couldn't be\nanything else.\"\n\nThe hangar was filled with row on row of the monstrous vessels,\ntowering ellipsoidal shapes whose crowns were lost in the gloom that\nwas more desolate than the absolute darkness. But the long shining\nhulls looked as if ready for flight on an instant's notice.\n\nThe Earthmen dismounted from the scooters and headed for the nearest\nship, eyes searching for a port.\n\n\"These are wonderful finds from an archeological standpoint,\" said\nTerry, \"but they're not likely to contain our weapon because they seem\nto be strictly commercial vessels rather than warships.\"\n\n\"We can't know,\" said Underwood. \"If there was such a state of\nGalactic unrest as the conflict between the Sirenians and the Dragbora\nindicates, it might have been that all commercial ships were armed.\"\n\n\"Is that a hatchway?\" said Phyfe, pointing suddenly upward.\n\nUnderwood stared in the direction of the beam from the archeologist's\nflashlight. As he did so, a score of beams flashed upon them from all\nparts of the terminal. Running figures could be seen dimly in the side\nreflections.\n\nThe Earthmen whirled about in astonishment and sudden fear. They\nstarted for the scooters on a run, then stopped short.\n\nA voice rang harshly in their ears. \"Halt and disarm in the name of\nDemarzule, the Great One!\"\n\nThe enormity of their blunder broke upon them simultaneously with\nall its mind-crushing force. They had imagined every possible\ncontingency--except that of a garrison left upon the planet by the\nTerrestrian fleet.\n\nOnce again they had underestimated Demarzule!\n\nUnderwood called suddenly into his microphone, turning up the power\nto reach the other groups of explorers and those yet at the ship.\n\"Underwood calling. We're attacked by Demarzule's garrison. Defend--\"\n\nA laugh cut him off. \"They would like to defend, no doubt, but the\nrest of them are as helpless as you are. Do you suppose that you could\noutwit the all-knowing mind of the Great One? He will be pleased to see\nthose who dared match wits with him. He will be even more pleased with\nhis servants for returning you.\"\n\nUnderwood could not see the speaker because the ring of lights blinded\nthem, but now one of the spacesuited figures stepped forward into the\nlight of the other lamps and gestured imperiously.\n\n\"Back to your ship!\" he commanded. \"We will return to Earth at once, as\nsoon as all of you are rounded up. Don't think of escape. We outnumber\nyou ten to one in this city, and those of us who stood guard in other\nplaces will join us. Our fleet has been notified already of our\nsuccess and they will return immediately to escort us back.\"\n\nThere was no identifying the voice of the speaker as other than\nTerrestrian, but there was something in it that none of their\nsemantically trained minds had ever heard before, something that\nchilled and terrified the sensitive Dreyer.\n\nUnderwood sensed it, and his mind struggled to evaluate its\nimplications. The voice was that of one who has seen a great and\nmighty destiny for himself and his race, all the more shining\nbecause unrestricted by reality. And in that great and illusory\ndream, all creatures other than himself and his chosen god sank into\ninsignificance.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was the voice and the dream of a madman.\n\nNone of the others spoke, but they remained like diligent herdsmen as\nthe scientists were forced to walk back up the long incline, leaving\nthe scooters behind.\n\nOut on the surface again, they saw that there were at least two\ndozen of the Great One's Disciples, indistinguishable in space garb.\nThey had planned with obvious care, doubtless with maps provided by\nDemarzule, placing units of their garrison at strategic points where\nthe scientists would be most likely to explore first.\n\nUnderwood hoped that perhaps some of the other groups had had better\nluck than his, but it was unlikely, for the scientists had been totally\nunprepared for attack. When the fleet had been seen retreating into\nspace, they had assumed that threat from that quarter had vanished with\nit.\n\nThey marched slowly between the black and shining planes of the city's\nwalls toward the _Lavoisier_, and as they moved they saw other groups\nof the scientists being led back from the opposite side of the landing\narea.\n\nThe ship had already been taken over. That hadn't been difficult,\nUnderwood supposed. Any approaching figures would have been taken for\nsome of the scientists returning. Inside the ship, when the invaders\nburst from the airlocks, weapons ready, the scientists would have had\nlittle chance.\n\nUnderwood and his group were led into the lock and followed by four of\ntheir captors with readied weapons. The scientists were ordered out\nof the spacesuits. When the lock was opened, they were turned over\nto others who were waiting for them inside the ship. Their original\ncaptors returned to the outside.\n\nUnderwood's eyes searched the faces of those who had taken over the\nship, as if for some sign of the superiority by which the scientists\nhad been trapped, but there was nothing in those faces, only the light\nof fanaticism shining dimly in the eyes.\n\nUnderwood felt sick as he watched Illia led away to be imprisoned in\nher own stateroom. The men were herded together into another room, and\nthe sound of the locking door was like the final blow to all their\nhopes.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor moments they looked at each other in silence. At last Terry grinned\nbleakly. \"It looks as if we missed the boat this time, doesn't it?\nEven if we could find the way out of this rat trap, there are the\nbattleships of the fleet on their way here.\"\n\nSound came dimly from other parts of the ship, but the men could\nidentify none of them. They supposed that the other groups were being\nrounded up and imprisoned. The whole thing had been worked out as if\nwith foreknowledge of their movements. Underwood wondered if Demarzule\ndidn't almost possess such powers.\n\nHe crossed to a chair in the corner of the room and sat down to try\nto think. His thoughts only went around in circles that seemed to\ngrow smaller and smaller until he could concentrate on only the one\ninescapable fact of their imprisonment.\n\nHe wondered what was passing through the minds of the others. Phyfe,\nslumped upon a bunk, seemed to have been abandoned by the fierce,\nbright spirit that had carried him along this far in the face of their\nobstacles. Terry was squirming restlessly. Dreyer sat heavily in the\nopposite corner from Underwood, a cloud from his cigar almost obscuring\nhim from view.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut there were deep lines in Dreyer's forehead and his face bore a\nfierce desolation that Underwood had never seen there before--as though\nall Dreyer's own personal gods had fled at once.\n\nUnderwood knew that Dreyer's mind must be wrestling more with the\nproblem of responsibility for their failure rather than with the\nproblem of escape. To the semanticist it would be important to\ndetermine whether the men or their science had failed. He had probably\neliminated the problem of their escape by evaluating it as impossible.\n\nWhile his thoughts revolved in endless procession, Underwood's senses\nbecame more acutely aware of the scores of sounds carried by the\nmetallic walls and framework of the ship. He found himself straining to\nidentify and separate the sounds.\n\nThere was one that persisted above all the others, but it was not the\nscrape of feet against steel floors, nor the bumping of closing and\nopening ports. Rather, it was the sound of a voice, so distant as to be\nscarcely audible.\n\nIt tapped at the threshold of his consciousness for minutes before he\nadmitted it was more than imagination. He turned his eyes toward one\nafter the other of his companions, wondering if they had heard it. Then\nfor the first time he distinguished words.\n\n\"Men of Earth,\" the faint voice called.\n\nUnderwood stood up suddenly. Terry jerked his head about. \"You heard\nit, too?\" he asked.\n\nUnderwood nodded. \"I could have sworn someone was in this room talking.\nListen, now--it's getting louder.\"\n\nWhile they stared at each other questioningly, there came a sudden\nwavering of light in the center of the room. They glanced at the\nillumination panel, but nothing was wrong there. Still the distortion\nof light in their midst took on vague shape. It wavered and writhed,\nas if it were an image on a sheet being tossed in the wind. Then it\nassumed questionable solidity.\n\nIt was human in form, taller than a man and copper-skinned.\n\n\"Jandro!\" Underwood exclaimed.\n\nThe image faded and wavered again.\n\n\"How can it be?\" murmured Phyfe.\n\nThe image was not a thing of reality, Underwood knew. It was no more\nthan conjuration within their own brains, yet the experience appeared\nidentical to all of them. That Jandro was in some strange manner\ncommunicating with them, Underwood had no doubt, but the means were\nutterly beyond comprehension.\n\n\"I do not know whether you can hear me or not,\" the voice of Jandro\nspoke in their minds. \"Listen to me if you can. I see and hear you, and\nyour actions indicate you are aware of my presence. I am communicating\nby means of the _abasic_ senses. I know now that you neither possess\nnor understand the _abasic_ organs. It had puzzled me that you did not\nuse them.\n\n\"What you are or who you are, I cannot guess. You are not men, of\ncourse, for men cannot live without the _abasa_. Proof that you did not\npossess it was provided when you allowed yourselves to be trapped and\ncaptured. I could not understand it, for I perceived your enemies the\ninstant your ship touched the surface of the planet.\n\n\"Our ancient myths and legends speak of creatures such as you, animals\nwho could survive without the _abasa_, but never were they spoken of as\nhaving the intelligence you display. Whatever you have done, you have\ndispelled our one great legend--not only is metal not reserved for the\nnon-existent gods, it is also permitted to such creatures as you.\n\n\"Therefore, I will bargain with you. I will teach my people to know and\nvalue the ancient science and the metal culture that they have been\ndenied. You will help me in exchange for my help in overpowering your\nenemies. Are you willing to do that?\"\n\n\"Where are you? How can you do this?\" Underwood demanded.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You can understand the thoughts that I speak, but I cannot understand\nyour language.\" Jandro said.\n\n\"There's only one answer,\" Dreyer said to his companions. \"Is it\nagreeable to all of us?\"\n\nThe others nodded, and Dreyer spoke quickly in Jandro's tongue. \"We\nwill do whatever is in our power.\"\n\n\"I feel that you are sufficiently intelligent to keep your word,\"\nsaid Jandro. \"When one of your enemies next enters the room, I will\noverpower him and you will be free to seize his weapon and to leave.\nI will be with you later, though you do not see me. I will visit the\nothers now.\"\n\nThe image and the voice were suddenly gone, and the four men looked at\neach other as if awakening from a dream that they had miraculously\nshared.\n\n\"So the organs they graft in give them telepathic powers,\" said Terry.\n\"It's funny he didn't get wise to us from the very first when we used\nspoken language all the time. Or was he reading our minds?\"\n\n\"No, he wasn't, and can't,\" said Phyfe. \"Recall his words that he\nhad to have us speak in his own language in order for him to receive\ncommunication from us here. It would suggest that one faculty was\nused in impressing our minds with his message, and another was used\nin detecting our speech. As for our using spoken language at first,\nhe probably allowed for it because we were strangers and gave us the\nprerogative of selecting our own medium of communication. Do you agree,\nDreyer?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe semanticist nodded. \"I think we have witnessed at least two\nseparate functions of the organs grafted into Jandro. And I would\nsuggest that we are about to witness still another if he is able to\nkeep his promise of overpowering the next Disciple to enter our room.\nAlso, do not forget the semantic implications of the _abasa_ to Jandro.\nHe is a man and we are lower animals to his way of thinking. It may not\never be possible to alter that view. We should act accordingly.\"\n\nThere was a moment of silence, then they grew tense with expectancy\nas the sound of the door lock clicked in the silence and one of the\nDisciples entered the room.\n\nHe stood in the doorway surveying them, a middle-aged man, erect of\nbearing, obviously a professional militarist. He said stiffly, \"In the\nname of the Great One you are ordered to appear before the Commander\nfor questioning. You will come at--.\"\n\nA sudden glassy stare crept into his eyes, and a look of intolerable\nagony flashed across his face. His stiffened, arrogant form stood in\nutter lifelessness. Then, slowly, it crashed to the floor.\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER FOURTEEN_\n\n\nUnderwood swept up the gun that fell from the loosened fingers before\nit hit the floor. He jerked it into firing position and approached the\nopen iris of the doorway cautiously. The corridor was clear for the\nmoment.\n\n\"You and Dreyer remain here,\" he said to Phyfe. \"Terry and I will try\nto make it to the control room or wherever this so-called Commander is\nkeeping headquarters. If we can capture him and gain control of the\nship, you should hear from us within an hour. If not, you'll know we\nhave failed, and then it will be up to you to make a try.\"\n\nThe older men nodded. Silently, he and Terry slipped through the\ndoorway.\n\nThe rest of the iris doors on the corridor were all closed. Underwood\npressed the release lock on the one adjacent to his own recent prison.\nThe opening flared wide, revealing Roberts, one of the surgeons, and\nthe three men who had formed his party.\n\n\"Underwood!\" Roberts exclaimed. \"What happened?\"\n\nUnderwood cautioned him to quiet and explained briefly. \"Locate some\nweapons if you can. There should be some in the corridor lockers. Make\nyour way down, and release them. Try to hold the locks against the\nentry of any more of the Disciples until we can gain control inside the\nship. We have no idea how many are here.\"\n\nThe men nodded, exuberant at the opportunity for action against the\nenemy. There should be weapons in a corridor compartment only a\nshort distance toward the rear, Underwood knew. Ahead, there was an\nadditional compartment from which he and Terry could reinforce their\nown armament.\n\nThe next room they tried was empty. They thought at first that the one\nadjacent to it was also empty, but as they started to move away, Terry\nexclaimed, \"Look! There on the floor!\"\n\nOne of their men was lying sprawled, the back of his shirt covered with\nblood and burned tissue.\n\nUnderwood and Terry stepped in and shut the iris door. The man looked\nup and smiled feebly as they looked down at him.\n\n\"Hi, Doc,\" he said.\n\nIt was Armstrong, one of the ship's engineers.\n\n\"What happened?\" asked Terry. \"Did you try to buck them?\"\n\nThe engineer answered painfully. \"No. It was a sort of object lesson.\nI think. The Commander--Rennies, they call him--gave me his personal\nattention. But have you got the ship back?\"\n\nUnderwood shook his head. \"We've just broken out and managed to free a\nfew of the others. Can you hang on a while until we can get help?\"\n\n\"Yeah, sure. Don't worry about me.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Do you know how many of them there are aboard?\"\n\n\"About twenty took us over in the beginning. We were puzzled when we\nthought so many of you were coming back at once. Sessions and Treadwell\ndown in the engine room were killed outright and a couple more of the\nboys pretty badly shot up when they tried to resist. They're the only\nones I know of, besides me. Rennies and his gang took up headquarters\nin the control room the last I heard. That's about all the dope I can\ngive you.\"\n\n\"It helps,\" said Underwood. \"We can take care of twenty of them, if we\ncan get organized. Take it easy, old man, and we'll be back with help.\"\n\nThe engineer smiled and his eyes closed.\n\nUnderwood and Terry hurried out, closing the iris door behind them.\nThey came to the storage closets and found to their relief that the\ninvaders had not removed the weapons stored there. Underwood selected\nanother gun; Terry took a pair.\n\n\"I wish we'd hear again from Jandro,\" said Terry.\n\n\"He may be helping the group down at the locks. We're on our own here,\nit appears.\"\n\nThey came to the end of the corridor and the passage split, forming a\nU around the control room because the navigational machinery had to be\nlocated on the axis of the ship.\n\n\"Let's separate,\" Underwood said. \"It'll give us a chance to attack\nfrom two directions. They may not have a guard that's too alert, since\nwe couldn't be expected to need much guarding.\"\n\n\"Good idea,\" said Terry. He checked his watch with Underwood's. \"Begin\nfiring in exactly sixty seconds!\"\n\nThey separated and went swiftly in opposite directions.\n\nAs Underwood came to the abrupt turn that would put him in a direct\nline with the door to the control room, he halted and listened for\nsounds from beyond. Footsteps were moving carelessly and hurriedly.\nOnly one person, Underwood thought; therefore, it must be one of the\nDisciples. There was the unlikely possibility that one of his own men\nhad escaped independently and had already been to the control room.\nHe'd have to risk that.\n\nHe stepped around the corner and fired.\n\nThe shot caught the man--a Disciple, luckily--full in the chest. An\ninstant's surprised agony did not prevent a wild cry from issuing from\nhis throat. Underwood leaped over the fallen body before the Disciple\nceased struggling.\n\nFrom inside the control room there were sudden confused shouts and\norders. Underwood saw two figures running toward the iris. He fired\ntwice, then dropped to the floor. The first man collapsed in the path\nof the second, but the latter was only slightly wounded. He raised his\nweapon toward Underwood even as he fell.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFrom his prone position, Underwood fired again. The blast missed and\nreddened the metal of the far wall of the room for a moment.\n\nUnderwood did not dare move. He could find little shelter in the small\ncorner where the circled doorway did not fully meet the rectangular\ncorridor, but there was no other to be had.\n\nShots from within the control room were coming close now. He could\nfeel the heat they generated in the metal floor. While he tried to\nedge closer into the corner, somebody else came into his view. It was\nan impressive, militaristic figure, undoubtedly Commander Rennies,\nfor his harsh, arrogant voice was ordering one of the men to call for\nassistance from the other end of the ship.\n\nThen, suddenly, the Commander stiffened. Even Underwood could glimpse\nthe stare that glazed his eyes like polished glass. Jandro?\n\nThe others in the room saw it also, and heard the crash as the heavy\nbody fell to the floor.\n\nThe disaster to the Disciples disrupted their attack for an instant. It\nwas long enough for Underwood to get his gun up and fire straight at\nhis opponent. The man started and whirled with a look of surprise on\nhis face for an instant before he died.\n\nAnd then another shot came from the opposite side of the room and\ncaught one of the remaining defenders unaware. Terry was there at last!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUnderwood breathed heavily in relief. He had been afraid Terry had been\ncaught. Apparently the archeologist had met opposition of his own and\nhad eventually succeeded in overcoming it.\n\nTerry and Underwood rushed the control room simultaneously. Only a\nsingle member of the Disciples was able to offer resistance. Beams\nfrom the two guns crossed the room and caught him in a lethal blaze.\n\nCautiously, Underwood advanced not quite inside the doorway.\n\n\"Terry, you there?\" he called.\n\n\"Check. I ran into one of them in the corridor.\"\n\n\"Keep out of the way. I'm going to come in blasting in your direction\nin case any more of these fanatics are hiding.\"\n\n\"Right. If I don't get your okay in five or so, I'll come in the same\nway.\"\n\nUnderwood set the beam to a low but deadly intensity and fanned it up\nand down, bringing the plane of motion ever nearer the wall that could\nbe hiding an attacker. Without exposing himself, he extended his hand\nand brought the gun about until he knew the room was cleared or that\nany one hiding there had been hit.\n\nHe entered then and called to Terry. The redhead entered grinning, but\na smear of blood covered his left arm from the shoulder down.\n\n\"Terry! You're hurt!\"\n\n\"I didn't get him good enough with my first shot. I'll be all right.\nWhat do we do now?\"\n\n\"We can clear the ship by throwing some chloryl triptanate into the\nair system. But even after that, we can't even go back to the moon to\nreturn Jandro to his own people--that would bring the whole fleet down\non them.\"\n\n\"We'll figure something out,\" said Terry optimistically. \"We didn't\nexpect to get this far. I wonder what happened to that guy Jandro. Have\nyou found out where he actually is yet?\"\n\n\"No. He apparently killed Rennies, but I've heard nothing from him.\"\n\n\"I'll get the triptanate, and some mesarpin for antidote. If I'm not\nback in half an hour, it'll be your baby.\"\n\n\"You guard here,\" said Underwood, \"You'd better take it easy with that\narm of yours.\"\n\n\"You're more important around here than I am. I'll be back in five\nminutes.\" Terry disappeared in the direction of surgery.\n\nUnderwood sat down wearily--and suddenly became aware of the fixed dead\nstare of the eyes of Commander Rennies, who lay on the floor.\n\nHis name had been vaguely familiar to Underwood and now he knew\nwhy. Rennies had attained considerable renown in the interstellar\nmilitary field. He had been an able leader, highly trained, widely\nread, intelligent, and a clever tactician--yet his mind had been as\nvulnerable to Demarzule as the most illiterate of the Disciples.\n\nThen Underwood became aware of a slow stirring upon the floor. The last\nDisciple he had shot was not dead. The lips twisted in a snarl of hate.\n\n\"Fools!\" The Disciple spat out. Blood poured from between his lips.\n\"Do you suppose you can block the Great One? The human race waited ten\nthousand years for this savior. Man shall become the greatest in all\nthe Universe with him as leader. Pay homage to the Great One as all the\nGalaxies shall pay homage to us!\"\n\nUnderwood said, \"Why?\"\n\n\"Because we are the greatest!\"\n\nHe looked at the man curiously. It was as if the knowledge of semantics\ndid not exist, yet for twelve hundred years semanticists had slowly\nbeen prying loose the ancient false extensions that cluttered men's\nthinking and dwarfed their concepts.\n\nDemarzule had wiped out all of that merely by his presence. Underwood\nfound himself wondering why he should be at all concerned with the\nmatter.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe knew, however, that as a member of the human race he had to keep on\nhoping that the course of evolution would lead it to something greater\nthan constant strife and insecurity. He had been blind when he had\ntried to escape. There was no escape; he saw that very clearly now.\n\nA sudden sound in the corridor alerted his senses. His gun moved\nslightly to cover the entrances.\n\nThen Terry burst into view with the containers of chemicals from the\nsurgical lab.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Made it,\" he said. \"Any trouble here?\"\n\n\"No, just one revived for a little while to gab. He's dead now.\" The\nman was quiet in a pool of his own blood. \"How do things look out\nthere?\"\n\n\"A lot of racket in the direction of the lock area. Must be fighting\ngoing on down there. I didn't see anyone at all near this end.\"\n\nWhile he spoke, Terry bent over and moistened a strip of his clothing\nwith one of the liquids. He held it to his nostrils for a moment and\npassed it to Underwood. Then he opened the return air vent and poured\nthe contents of the other bottle into it. The highly volatile liquid\nquickly vaporized and passed to the fans of the central ventilating\nblowers, from which it passed into every chamber of the ship. Within\nten minutes it had anesthetized every person aboard the ship except the\ntwo who had inhaled the antidote.\n\nWhile they waited, Underwood stared thoughtfully at the dead Rennies.\n\"I wonder how Jandro kills,\" he said. \"Can there be any defense against\nsuch silent power? Have you thought of what that implies with relation\nto Jandro's people and the society they live in?\"\n\nTerry nodded. \"I haven't thought much of anything else since I first\nsaw him kill that guard in our stateroom. A civilization in which every\nmember holds a silent, secret weapon over the head of his neighbor.\nIt's incredible that it could exist.\"\n\n\"But it _has_ existed and continues to exist, and I'll bet that Jandro\nis the first of his kind to use this power for generations.\"\n\n\"It certainly implies a stability and individual recognition of\nresponsibility that has never existed among us. I doubt that it ever\nwill.\"\n\n\"Someday it _might_.\"\n\n\"We won't be around.\"\n\n\"There's something else, too,\" Underwood said. \"This may be the way out\nfor us. It could be.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Suppose just one of us had the power Jandro has. That would be the\nweapon against Demarzule that we need!\"\n\nTerry hesitated. \"We're not likely to get that power--and if we did, we\ncould never get near enough to Demarzule to use it.\"\n\n\"No? Suppose we let the fleet capture us and take us back. It's my\nguess that Demarzule wants us alive. His pleasure in our downfall\nshould come from personally witnessing our defeat. It would fit\nhis character. So we'll be brought back as prisoners. Then all that\nwould be necessary would be to dispose of him just as Jandro did with\nRennies.\"\n\n\"You're forgetting that Demarzule has the same organs and the same\npowers. You don't know what kind of defense could be offered against\nthem--perhaps they are immune to such attacks themselves. That would\nexplain this mystery of Dragboran civilization. Maybe Demarzule\ncould detect it if any of us possessed the organs. Lastly, there is\nabsolutely no possibility of our getting them, anyway.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUnderwood's face darkened. \"That's the one thing I haven't figured out\nyet, but there's got to be a way. It looks as if this is the only hope\nleft us to destroy the alien. We'd have to defeat the whole fleet to\ncontinue searching for the Dragboran weapon, and there's no chance of\nthat.\"\n\n\"I hope you're right. Well, the anesthetic has had time to act. Let's\nrevive our men and set to work on it.\"\n\nThey made sure of their weapons, and left the control room. Within the\nwhole ship there was no sound except their footsteps in the corridor.\nOne by one, they opened the stateroom doors as they went down toward\nthe locks. They held the cloths moistened with the restoring vapors to\nthe nostrils of each of their own men.\n\nThe first were Dreyer and Phyfe. Mason and his crew were found in the\nnext room toward the stern. Quick explanations were made and those\nrevived went to the task of restoring still others.\n\nIn Illia's stateroom, they found her lying composed upon her bunk.\nFor a moment, as he looked down upon her serene features, Underwood\nforgot the intense urgency of his tasks. He tried to recall just why he\nhad been willing to sacrifice the life that Illia and he had hoped to\nshare--sacrifice, because she had believed in man, while Underwood had\nwanted only escape from the pressure of an erratic and chaotic society.\nSurely that life together would not have been postponed if he could\nhave seen the choices earlier as he saw them now. Was it too late to\nhope now for reprieve from the destruction that hovered over them? He\ndared not answer.\n\nGently, he restored her to consciousness.\n\n\"I had the nicest dream,\" she said. \"I knew you were in control as soon\nas the first whiff of triptanate came through.\"\n\n\"We're not in control yet. The main fleet will arrive within a few\nhours and have us cornered. Most of us are revived with the exception\nof a large group down by the locks. Will you go up and help Armstrong,\nthe engineer? He's in B05 and badly hurt. We haven't been able to do a\nthing for him yet.\"\n\nIllia nodded. \"I'll take care of him. Any others?\"\n\n\"Terry here.\" He motioned at Terry's bloodcaked arm. \"You'd have to\ntie him down to work on him, though. Maybe he can go until we get\norganized.\"\n\nThey separated in the corridor and Underwood hurried on toward the\nstern locks. As he came up he could see a large group of the men\ngathered around. Apprehension drove him to a run along the narrow\npassageway. The group turned as they heard his footsteps and made a\npath for him.\n\nA scene of death lay before him. Bodies of scientists and Disciples lay\nside by side on the floor. There were Roberts, the surgeon, and Parker\nand Muth, two of the chemists. Three others were not recognizable. Six\nof his own men had died and five of the Disciples before the gas had\nbrought an instant and bloodless end to the battle.\n\nHe turned away. He wished there might have been some other way than\nsacrificing those men, but if the scientists had not held the lock, the\nDisciples might have remained in permanent control of the ship.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe beckoned to Terry, who was checking the roster with Mason. \"Have you\naccounted for everyone yet?\"\n\n\"Peters, Atchison, and Markham appear to be the three we couldn't\nidentify,\" said Terry. \"And, of course, Jandro. No one has heard or\nseen anything of him since he killed Rennies.\"\n\n\"Jandro!\" Underwood was suddenly and fearfully aware of Jandro's\nabsence. \"We've got to find him. There's no use of any of us leaving\nunless we do.\"\n\n\"I couldn't be sure, but I think I saw him from the lock viewplates a\nminute ago,\" Captain Dawson said. \"There's no way of telling except by\nthat oversize spacesuit, but he may be lying on the ground out there.\"\n\n\"If he's been killed--\" Underwood raced toward the nearest viewing\nstation.\n\nHe switched it on and scanned the area about the ship. Disciples were\nmilling about, hesitant about using their Atom Stream weapons to force\nentrance without orders from their Commander.\n\nDawson pointed. \"Toward the stern--there!\"\n\nIt was unmistakably Jandro, though a blast had blackened the upper\nright portion of the spacesuit and a gap showed in it.\n\n\"If the self-sealers worked, he may not have been out there too long,\"\nUnderwood said urgently. \"Dawson, drive the mob back with the big Atom\nStream, then throw a force shell over to Jandro so we can go out and\nget him.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDawson hurried away, calling for his mates and engineers on his way\nto the control room. Underwood remained watching the exterior from\nthe plate. Abruptly the Disciples turned and fled in panic. The blue\nradiance of the Atom Stream played about the ship, clearing a space\nbeyond Jandro. Then the view of all the ancient city and the fleeing\nDisciples was cut off as the impenetrable force shell went out. Mason\nand two of the crew were already in suits and in the lock. They opened\nit the instant the force shell stabilized.\n\nJandro had been lying in the sunlight. That might have saved him.\nUnderwood thought, for the suit absorbed the radiant heat.\n\nThe three men reached the Dragboran and lifted him carefully. They did\nnot know whether he was dead or alive as they gently rolled him onto a\nstretcher and carried him to the ship.\n\nUnderwood located Akers, the surgeon next in skill to Illia, who\nordered the surgery prepared. Underwood left his post and sought Illia.\nJandro would need all her skill if he still lived. But he wondered if\nthe engineer, Armstrong, did too.\n\nUnderwood found her still in the room where Armstrong lay. She was\nrising from her knees as he entered.\n\n\"There was nothing to be done for him,\" said Illia. \"I stayed until he\ndied. Do you need me anywhere else?\"\n\n\"Yes. Jandro was shot outside. Akers is making ready, but I want you to\ntake over. Jandro is the key to our whole success here. If he's alive,\nhe's got to be kept alive.\"\n\nIllia looked at him questioningly.\n\n\"I'll do my best,\" she cried.\n\nAkers was quite willing for Illia to take over when he saw Jandro. The\nwound was ghastly to see, slashing across the full width of the chest.\n\nWhile Jandro was in surgery, Underwood called a general meeting. They\ngathered rapidly in the conference room, but their worn and strained\nfaces were little short of tragic.\n\n\"We've lost our chance for any Dragboran super-weapon we might have\nfound in the ruins here,\" said Underwood without preamble. \"We're\ndefenseless--except for the shell--and outnumbered. We can't run\nbecause the fleet can run faster, and we can't stay bottled up here\nforever. I can think of only one thing possible that we can do.\"\n\nThe others did not need to be reminded of the hopelessness of their\nsituation, but their eyes lighted with interest at the last sentence.\nThen he outlined briefly his idea of obtaining the organs and powers\nthat Jandro possessed and allowing themselves to be captured and taken\nto Demarzule.\n\n\"It sounds good for a last-ditch stand,\" said Mason. \"But you haven't\nexplained how we are going to get back to the moon so that we can\nobtain these things from the Dragbora.\"\n\n\"That is the one missing element of the plan,\" said Underwood. Then he\nadded fiercely, \"And it's got to be solved! That's why I called you\nhere. I haven't the answer, but together we've got to find it. It's our\nlast chance to stop Demarzule.\"\n\nMason jumped to his feet. \"There ought to be several hours yet before\nthe fleet arrives. We might have time to rig up a field generator and\nset up a dummy here to make the Disciples believe we're hiding under\nit, while we actually take off for the moon.\"\n\n\"That's it!\" Underwood exclaimed. \"Only we'll have to move around the\nplanet to avoid detection by the local garrison. But that will do it!\"\n\nThe interphone sounded. Illia said, \"We're finished, Del. Jandro is\nalive, but he'll be dead within an hour. If you want to see him, you'd\nbetter come now.\"\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER FIFTEEN_\n\n\nUnderwood started for the door without hesitation. \"We'll try your\nplan, Mason. Take over. Dreyer, Phyfe--please come along with me.\"\n\nThey hurried to the room next to surgery where Jandro lay in bed,\nmotionless and unseeing. Only Illia and Akers were with him.\n\nAt the sight of that unmoving figure, Underwood experienced a depth\nof sorrow and pity that wiped out all other thoughts for a moment.\nHe felt that he alone of all the Earthmen could understand the deep\nrebellion, the dreams and the hopes that had been the driving force in\nJandro's life. And this was a mean end for such bright dreams--death at\nthe hands of crazed fanatics on a Heaven World that had proved to be\nanything but that.\n\nUnderwood thought of the green, shining moon of the refugee Dragbora\nwhere men lived in peace with one another. The moon that Jandro would\nnever see again.\n\nJandro's eyes fluttered open slowly and gradual recognition came into\nthem. Dreyer said softly, \"We're sorry. If there were anything within\nour power to get you back to your own world and your own people, we\nwould do it. I hope you know that.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Jandro slowly. \"I would like my _seaa-abasa_ to be\nwith those of my ancestors for the day when life will return. But I\nthink perhaps it never will. It is like our dream of the gods, only a\ndelusion. As for death, that is certain for every man. How or when it\ncomes is not important. It is strange for me to observe the grief of\nanimals for a man. Strange--\"\n\n\"Doesn't he suppose there was a time when the Dragbora never had the\nmother-flesh and the secret of the _abasa_?\" Asked Underwood, and\nDreyer translated for him.\n\n\"Naturally,\" Jandro replied. \"We were merely animals then, as you are\nnow. When you came in your ships of metal, all of us thought surely the\ngods had come to return us to Heaven World again. You did us a great\nfavor in showing us how wrong we were in our legends and our dreams.\nBut until we arrived on this planet, I still thought you were superior\nbeings because I could not detect your _epthalia_. None of us have the\nability to hide it from each other.\"\n\n\"But you knew it when we were attacked?\" said Dreyer.\n\n\"I could not understand why you did not act to forestall your enemies\nwho were so apparent to me. Then I realized that it was because you did\nnot possess the _abasa_ at all. I was frightened because I did not know\nwhat to do. I had never dreamed in all my life that I would meet with\ncreatures who might be gods because they possessed the metals, and yet\nwere lower than men because they did not have the _abasa_. I did not\nunderstand.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"We do not understand many things about each other,\" said Underwood,\n\"but perhaps you understand us well enough now to know that we need\nyour help against these enemies of ours--and of yours.\n\n\"Many hundreds of thousands of years ago, there was a race, called the\nSirenians, and they were deadly enemies of your race, the Dragbora.\nLike you, they possessed the _abasa_, but instead of living peacefully\nthey set out to conquer all the worlds and the Galaxies. In the end\nthey were defeated by your people who had some mysterious weapon that\npenetrated every defense of the Sirenians. We came to your ancient\nworld to find a clue to that weapon because one of the Sirenians\nsucceeded in surviving and is now at large upon our own world. He\nhas seized control over our people and is setting out to sweep the\nGalaxies with conquest and blood. In time he will find even your little\nworld. The civilizations of many Galaxies will suffer centuries of\nretrogression.\n\n\"We didn't find the weapon we came for, and now our chance is gone, for\nthe fleet of Demarzule, the Sirenian, is almost upon us. There is just\none hope left to us.\n\n\"We believe that his men will capture us alive and take us to him if we\npermit it. If we could be taken into his presence bearing the power of\ndestruction that lies in the _abasa_, we might be able to destroy him.\n\n\"Can you--will you--make it possible for us to gain that power by\ngrafting the _abasa_ in some of us upon your world?\"\n\nDreyer translated as rapidly as possible the swift spoken words of\nUnderwood while Jandro lay with closed eyes, as if sleeping a dreamless\nsleep. It was a long time after Dreyer finished that Jandro slowly\nopened his eyes again.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis voice was so low that Dreyer had to lean forward to catch his words.\n\n\"It is a strange story you tell,\" he said, \"but I am impressed that\nwhat you say is true. As to your request--no. It would be utterly\nimpossible for you to be given fresh _abasa_ as are the young of our\nrace. Not that I wouldn't make it possible for some of you--a very\nfew--to receive them, if I could, but the _abasa_ can be installed in\nonly the very young.\n\n\"The use of the _abasa_ is similar to that of the organs of walking or\nspeaking. The organs must develop from their rudimentary forms through\nlong years of usage, and skill with them comes much more slowly than\nany of the other common skills. Though they are installed in us in\ninfancy, most of us are well matured before we gain great skill. For\nthis reason alone it would be impossible for you to have the organs.\"\n\nAcross the bed, Underwood's eyes met Illia's and held for an\nendless moment. In her he sought strength to endure the crushing\ndisappointment. Illia's eyes gave him blind assurance that there would\nyet be a way.\n\n\"Your race will, in time, develop and learn the use of the _abasa_,\"\nJandro went on, \"but not for many hundreds of generations. From what\nI have seen of your people, I wonder what your world would be like if\nevery one possessed the power to kill at will, silently, and without\ndetection. I do not know the answer to that, but I ask you to answer\nit for yourselves. The mere fact that you have not yet developed the\n_abasa_ is proof that you are not ready for it.\n\n\"The Dragbora live in peace not because they have such terrible power;\nthey can live with such power because they have first learned how men\nmust live with one another. You cannot understand why the power of\ndeath is inherent in the _abasa_. It is merely one of the inevitable\nfunctions that accompany the other greater and more useful powers, most\nof which you shall, of course, never know. I wonder if you would want\nthe _abasa_, even if it were possible for you to possess it,\" Jandro\nfinished.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"For our race? No!\" Underwood shuddered at the thought of every man\nof Earth possessing instant, undetectable powers of death over his\nneighbor. \"You are right in that, Jandro. Whatever the other powers\nof the _abasa_ may be, we could not live with it. But Demarzule is a\ntotally extraneous factor not considered in our own evolution. We have\nno defense against him. If the power of death in the _abasa_ could be\nused to destroy him, it would give our race its one chance of staving\noff this threat.\n\n\"Yet you say it is impossible. It means for us no hope against the\nbarbarism that will destroy our civilization and brutalize our people,\nnot to mention what it means to the other civilizations of the\nGalaxy--including your own.\"\n\nThere was scarcely the sound of their breathing within the room as the\nEarthmen avoided each others' eyes now, staring down at the closed ones\nof Jandro.\n\n\"Your people hardly deserve the scourge of Demarzule and the Sirenian\ndemand for supremacy,\" said Jandro slowly. \"And what you say of the\nrest of the Universe is true. In a way, the Dragbora are responsible.\nDemarzule is a product of the Sirenian-Dragboran culture. My ancestors\nshould have made more sure of the total extinction of the Sirenian\nbranch. Perhaps there is one way in which we could yet help.\"\n\n\"You _can_ help?\" Underwood asked eagerly and incredulously.\n\n\"I have little longer to live. It would be worthwhile if, in that hour\nleft to me, I could complete the task of extinction--or at least enable\nyou to do so. If one of you is willing to take the risk, I will do what\nI can.\"\n\n\"No risk is too great! But what can be done?\"\n\n\"As far as I know, it has never been attempted, but perhaps my own\n_abasa_ could be transferred to you.\"\n\nDreyer translated the offer, his glance going from Illia to Underwood.\nSomething of hope seemed to come again into his eyes.\n\nUnderwood caught his breath sharply. \"A set of fully developed _abasa_\ntransferred to my own body! There would be one of us to meet Demarzule\non his own level. Illia--\"\n\nHer face was suddenly white. \"It's impossible, Del! I couldn't perform\nsuch an operation without any previous study with their anatomy. I\ncan't do it!\"\n\n\"It's got to be done, Illia. I'll take a chance on your skill.\"\n\n\"That's an utterly ridiculous statement. I have no skill in a case like\nthis. Tell him, Dr. Dreyer. He can't expect that much of me.\"\n\n\"I don't know, Illia,\" said the semanticist. \"It seems to me that you\nare confusing your analysis by your own personal emotions. You cannot\nbe evaluating properly under such conditions.\"\n\nShe bit her lips to hold back a further outburst. Then, at last she\nsaid, \"Don't ask the impossible of me, Del. I saw the way they split\nthe nerves in the operation we watched. It couldn't be done without\nlong practise. Most of all, I couldn't do it to you.\"\n\nAs if sensing the meaning of their argument, Jandro spoke suddenly.\n\"You will have great difficulty in making a successful installation\nbecause you are unfamiliar with the anatomy of the _abasa_, true, but\nI can help. I can guide and direct your hands up to the very point of\ncutting the nerves to the _tri-abasa_. You shall succeed if you allow\nme to guide you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUnderwood kept his eyes upon Illia. Her face was as pale as her shining\nhair.\n\n\"I'll try, Del,\" she said.\n\nNews of the projected experiment sped swiftly through the ship, and\nits significance was greeted with awed incomprehension as if Underwood\nhas suddenly stepped from their midst into a misty realm beyond their\nreach. And their awe was magnified by the knowledge that it could very\nwell mean death.\n\nWithin minutes of the decision, assistants were rolling the tables\nbearing the white sheeted forms of Underwood and Jandro into the\nsurgery.\n\nA strange peace, a sort of ecstasy, seemed to have come over Jandro.\nUnderwood had seen and heard of resignation in the face of death, but\nnever such serenity as possessed Jandro. It had a calming effect upon\nUnderwood and he shed the thoughts of his own possible death or maiming\nas a result of the strange operation. He thought only of the mission\nthat would be his once he owned the powers of the Dragbora.\n\nWhatever turmoil possessed Illia had vanished as she faced Underwood.\nThe sterile white of her surgeon's garb masked her personality and her\nfeelings, and left only a nameless agent possessed of science and skill.\n\nUnderwood grinned up at her as the anesthetic was injected. \"When I\nwake up I'll let you know how it feels to be a Dragboran.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt the adjacent operating table, Akers was preparing Jandro for the\npreliminary work of exposing the _abasic_ organs.\n\nThen, to each of them came the unspoken command to abandon their\nminds by Jandro. It was an incredible, unearthly experience, but they\nreleased their senses and gradually the guiding impulses from the\nDragboran brain surged into their own.\n\nFor just the barest fraction of an instant, Illia's hand trembled\nas she touched the electronic scalpel to the flesh at the base of\nUnderwood's shaven skull. The skin severed, and her nerves were threads\nof steel.\n\nWith increasing speed, Akers and Illia made the incisions in the bodies\nbefore them. Their hands moved surely, as if Jandro were seeing with\ntheir eyes and using their hands.\n\nThe deep incision was made in Underwood's skull. The pulsing brain lay\nexposed. Illia concentrated for an instant as waves of instruction\nflowed from Jandro. Then, swiftly, the scalpel cut a bloodless path\nthrough a section of unused tissue.\n\nShe moved to the adjacent table and peered into the wound that Akers\nhad made in Jandro's head. She paused as his words came to her.\n\n\"This is the final step. I can go no further with you. Attend to my\ninstructions now and you shall succeed.\"\n\nFlashing, incomprehensible things flooded into her mind, imperishable\nphotographs of the remainder of this operation and the one to follow,\nin which the two abdominal organs would be transferred. Illia knew\nthat every picture would return in its own time to guide her hands in\nunfamiliar paths.\n\n\"Proceed!\" Jandro suddenly commanded. \"I retire to the _seaa-abasa_.\nFarewell!\"\n\nThe flowing pictures ceased and Illia felt suddenly alone, like a child\nlost amid a blinding storm. There was nothing to depend on now but her\nown skill and the telepathic instructions.\n\nShe faltered for an instant and breathed a name, \"Del--Del!\"\n\nAkers was watching her sharply as she stood staring at the strange,\nunearthly organ lying in the brain pan of the dead Dragboran.\n\nBut it was not strange. She knew its constitution and anatomy and the\ncomplex nerve hook-up that connected it with the brain. They were as\nclear as if she had studied them for many years.\n\nA surge of gladness and confidence filled her. She was alone in this\nyes, but that did not matter any more. She alone possessed the ability\nto perform the operation, and a world awaited the results.\n\nHer scalpel entered the incision and touched the flesh with a pinpoint\nof destruction that sheared away the tissue from the delicate white\nnerve channels serving the _abasic_ organ.\n\nFor a full hour, and then another, Akers watched in un-believing\nfascination as Illia freed the twelve separate nerve filaments serving\nit, then cut the artery and filled the vessels with the chemical\nsolution that would feed the cells until Underwood's blood could be\nsent pouring through it.\n\nAt last all that remained was the severing of the connecting tissues\nthat held the organ in place. Illia cut them and plunged her hands into\nthe sterilizing, protecting compound that had been prepared at Jandro's\ninstructions. She salved the organ and lifted it out, then thrust it\nquickly into the corresponding cavity in Underwood's brain pan.\n\nThis phase of the operation was less than half over. Blood vessels had\nto be prepared to serve the new organ in Underwood's body, and the\ntwelve nerves had to be connected into the Great Sympathetic where no\nsuch nerves had ever been connected before.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnother two hours passed before the final sutures closed the wound in\nUnderwood's head.\n\nWhen at last she laid the needle down, Illia's hand suddenly trembled\nand she quivered throughout her body.\n\n\"Can't we postpone the others for a time?\" asked Akers. \"You surely\ncan't go on with two more like that.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid the tissues will degenerate too much if we delay. If I were\nonly as fast as those Dragboran surgeons. What men they must be! Get me\na shot of neostrene and better have one yourself. We'll go on.\"\n\nAkers was willing, but he didn't believe that Illia could stand more\nhours of exacting surgery. After a moment's rest, however, and a shot\nof the stimulant drug, she stepped back to the operating tables to\nperform the adbominal operation. Once again, Akers made the preliminary\nincisions.\n\nIn the control room the group leaders waited for news in nerve-racking\ninactivity. Terry Bernard paced about, his flaming disheveled hair\nlike a signal flare swinging through the room. Phyfe stood at one of\nthe observation panels watching the inexorable approach of Demarzule's\nfleet. Dawson sat at his Captain's position fingering the inactive\nswitches on the panel before him. Most placid of all, Dreyer simply\nsat in the navigation chair and smoked cigars so unrelentingly that it\ntaxed the ventilating system of the ship.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTerry glanced at the clock anxiously and stopped his pacing. \"It's been\nover thirteen hours since Underwood went in there. Don't you think we\nought to ask Illia--\"\n\n\"There are only two alternatives,\" said Dreyer. \"Success or failure.\nOur questioning will not assure success. We had best keep out of the\nway.\"\n\nMason kept anxious watch of the progress of the fleet. No one knew\nwhat would happen when the battleships arrived and surrounded the\n_Lavoisier_, but they had not long to wait. The ships were hardly more\nthan minutes away from the planet.\n\nAs if guided by a single mind, the ships turned slowly in the black\nsky as their navigators and lookouts spotted and set a course for the\nluminous bubble that marked the force shell hiding the _Lavoisier_.\n\nTo the crewmen watching from within, it was a fearful sight to\nwitness the sudden plunging flight of those twenty mighty ships.\nSimultaneously, a score of fearful Atom Streams were turned upon the\nbubble, apparently not in the futile hope of burning through the\nprotection, but to destroy the minute sensory probes and prevent the\nship from navigating away from the planet.\n\nIn spatial combat, where the ship was free to wheel and turn and defend\nitself, it would not have been so easy to destroy the probes. But\nwith the ship motionless upon the surface of the planet, the streams\nof incomprehensible fire washed over every square millimeter of the\nsurface of the shell, probing, destroying and setting off the multitude\nof relays within the _Lavoisier_, closing the hairlike openings in the\nshell as the probes were burned away.\n\nMason moved away as one after another of the segments on his plates\nwent dead until there was no vision whatever of the outside world.\n\nHe turned to the others and motioned toward the dead plates. \"This is\nit.\"\n\nThe spell that fell upon them was broken minutes later by Illia's\nabrupt voice on the interphone.\n\n\"The operation is finished.\"\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER SIXTEEN_\n\n\nConsciousness came to Underwood as if he were responding to the\npersistent voice of some unseen speaker. It called him out of the\ndepths of eternal existence into the realm of conflict and reality.\nCuriously, it sounded like Jandro.\n\nHe opened his eyes. Illia was there, her face white and strained. But\nas he looked at her, her blue eyes glistened and she bent down. \"Del!\nOh, Del--!\"\n\nTerry, Phyfe, Mason and Akers were standing near the bed, watching with\nanxious faces.\n\nPain was beginning to show itself in burning streamers, but he managed\na quick smile to those about him. \"Looks like we made it all right,\"\nhe said. \"I wonder what I can do with these gadgets now. Think they'll\nwork, Illia?\"\n\nShe raised up, brisk and businesslike once more. \"You aren't going\nto find out for a while. I intend to knock you out for a good, cold\ntwenty-four hours. Give me your arm.\"\n\nShe reached for a hypo needle on the table beside the bed.\n\nIt was like stumbling around in the dark at first, trying to run from\nan unseen pursuer. But all at once, Underwood knew he didn't need to\nrun at all. The hypo was blocking the sensory equipment in other parts\nof his body, but it couldn't affect the _abasic_ organs if he didn't\nwant it to. He stopped running and watched the ordinary faculties of\nhis body give way while he stood aside in complete immunity. It was as\nif he could step outside and look at himself.\n\nAnd, suddenly, that was what he was doing!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe could see the room, the watching scientists, and Illia carefully\nchecking his heartbeat and respiration. He could see himself lying\nstill with eyes closed. Curiously, he could not identify the point\nof view. He thought for a moment that he was up near the ceiling\nsomewhere, looking down, but that wasn't right, either, because he\ncould see the ceiling just as well as the floor or the four walls. The\nscene was like a picture taken with a lens having a solid angle of\nperception of three hundred and sixty degrees.\n\nHe wondered if he could go beyond the limits of the room, tried it\nand found it quite easy to do. There was some clumsiness due to\ninexperience and conditioning that stopped him at the walls, where\nhe had a moment's claustrophobic fright of being trapped between the\nmetal panels, but it was over in an instant and he was through. He\nwent toward the control room and found it occupied only by Dreyer, who\nremained placidly smoking a cigar in the navigator's chair.\n\nUnderwood wanted to communicate with the semanticist, only he wasn't\nsure how to go about it. It was like trying to talk with a mouth full\nof dry crackers.\n\nBut Dreyer stared around with a sudden start. He removed the cigar from\nhis mouth and looked agape for an unseen speaker.\n\n\"Dreyer, can you hear me?\"\n\n\"Underwood! You succeeded!\"\n\n\"After a fashion. So far it's like walking around in deep mud, but I'm\ngetting used to it gradually.\"\n\n\"This is wonderful--_wonderful_!\" Dreyer breathed. \"I hadn't dared hope\nthat I would ever hear your voice again. Where are you?\"\n\n\"That's a tough question. Theoretically, I'm unconscious back in sick\nbay with a shot of neo-morph that will keep me out for twenty-four\nhours. Illia and the others are back there watching me. The _abasic_\nsenses aren't at all affected by the drug. I seem to be able to wander\nanywhere I wish about the ship. The funny part is that I can't pin down\na point of view. I don't seem to be anywhere. Nevertheless, my\nsenses perceive distant sounds and objects--including my own corpus.\"\n\n\"Can you detect my thoughts when I don't speak? Jandro didn't seem able\nto do that.\"\n\nUnderwood laughed. \"I don't know whether I can or not. I try, but all\nI get is a fuzzy static. I'm sure that these organs have dozens of\nfunctions that we haven't even dreamed of yet. I hope that I can learn\nto use them all.\"\n\n\"What do you plan now? Do you need a period of exercise and study?\"\n\n\"Some, but not nearly as much as I would have needed if it hadn't been\nJandro's mature organs that were grafted into me. There is something\nthat we never thought of before, though.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"We can still search for the Dragboran weapon we came here for. I can\ngo outside the ship with these new senses. I don't know whether I can\ncover the whole planet or not, but if not, we can move to keep in range\nof my powers. It will be slow because I am the only one who can do it,\nbut it may be faster in the end because I can get around more quickly.\"\n\n\"I wonder if it will be possible in the presence of the fleet--or\ndidn't you know that they had arrived?\" Dreyer pointed toward the\nblank viewplates.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I didn't know. What are they doing there?\"\n\nUnderwood realized immediately the absurdity of the question. Dreyer\ncould know no more about it than he, since all communication with the\noutside was destroyed.\n\nWith all the strength he could gather, he hurled his new powers beyond\nthe scope of the ship, out into the contrasting heat and cold of the\nbarren planet. It was as if he had hurled himself high into space, for\nhe was viewing the broad expanse of the Dragboran world and the busy\nfleet of Demarzule.\n\nUnderwood's senses revolted at what he saw. Completely surrounding the\nship was utter, flaming destruction. The great city of the Dragbora\nhad been turned into molten ruin by the twenty ships, which spiraled\nslowly, their powerful beams of the Atom Stream turned upon the\nbuildings below. Even as Underwood watched, they completed their work\nupon that city and traveled toward another great city less than a\nhundred miles away.\n\nWhat purpose was behind the wanton ruin, Underwood could not\ncomprehend. Perhaps now that the scientists had been cornered, the\nTerrestrians hoped to destroy the super-weapon that could unseat\nDemarzule.\n\nWithin hours, the major cities of the planet would be shapeless mounds\nof frozen lava.\n\nHe debated trying to enter those vessels and overpowering members of\ntheir crews. At once his reason told him no, for he was still a toddler\nin the use of the new faculties he possessed. But there was a greater\nreason, too. If he should expose himself by such attacks, the ships\nwould send word to Earth, and Demarzule would easily identify the\nmethods used against his men and be prepared. Underwood knew how this\ndestruction of archeological treasures would affect Phyfe and Terry,\nbut more important was the loss of any chance to search for the weapon.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe turned his senses toward the bubble of the shell that hid the\n_Lavoisier_. Its shining surface was the only thing in all that broad\ncity that did not reek of destruction.\n\nAs Underwood regarded it, a shock of comprehension hit him. In the\nimpetuousness of his flight above the planet, he had overlooked the\nmost significant point of all.\n\nHe--his senses, at least--_had passed through the impenetrable force\nshell_.\n\nSudden fear mingled with that devastating realization. Could he get\nback through it? How had he passed the barrier in the first place? It\nwas mathematically impossible for matter or energy to be transferred\nacross it.\n\nDid his senses represent neither one?\n\nHe impelled himself toward it, waited for the impact--and felt none.\nThen he was through, looking at the interior of the shell and the ship\nwithin it.\n\nHis mind was afire with the significance of his discovery as he burst\ninto the control room. The others had rejoined Dreyer there. Mason and\nsome of his men were struggling to replace some of the probes now that\nthe attack upon the ship had ceased for the moment.\n\n\"We've found it!\" Underwood shouted. \"We've got the weapon that Dragbor\nturned upon Sirenia!\"\n\nIllia screamed at the sudden impact upon her worn nerve cells.\n\nMason whirled around in horror and cried, \"Underwood! Where are you?\"\n\n\"We can hit them wherever they try to hide,\" said Underwood, \"No matter\nwhere Demarzule tries to flee, I'll find him. There's no place in the\nUniverse he can hide from me!\"\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER SEVENTEEN_\n\n\nUnderwood's physical body recovered slowly from the severe shock of\nthe operation. He was immune to the pain of it, however, for having\nthe _abasic_ senses was like possessing another body. He could close\nall the normal channels of perception and exist with his consciousness\noperating only through the _abasic_ senses.\n\nWhile the fleet sped about the planet on its path of useless\ndestruction, Underwood spent his hours practising the use of his new\npowers.\n\nGradually, he obtained an understanding of their properties and some\nof their functions. The _tri-abasa_ was the sensory organ, located\nat the base of his brain, which could pick up distant, focusable\nsensations which any of his normal five senses could detect. They were\ncontrollable in their subjective effects, however, as he had found when\ngoing beyond the limits of the ship. Though he had been unaware of the\ninterstellar cold, it had no subjective effect upon his body or his\nsensory apparatus.\n\nThe _dor-abasa_ was the organ of communication, but it worked in\ncombination with the _tri-abasa_ in order to transmit and receive\nsensory effects. So it was that the two of them in combination could\ntransmit not only ordinary communication, but could convey the actual\nsensations of heat, cold, light, sound.\n\nAnd these same two organs were capable of dispensing swift and silent\ndeath.\n\nHow this happened was the greatest mystery Underwood had to solve.\nHe experimented by hurling the powers upon an artificial nervous\nsystem rigged up from a network of wires. A strong electric field was\ndefinitely measured within the wires, but it had properties that were\nnot within the physicists' prior experience. Regardless, Underwood\ncontinued with his practising and found that he could increase\nthe strength of that field more each time. If necessary, a full\nunderstanding of how it destroyed nerve tissue could wait until they\nreach their objectives upon Earth.\n\nThe third organ, the _seaa-abasa_, was the strangest of all.\nInterconnected intimately with the other two through nerve channels,\nit nevertheless had no obvious functions. Jandro had referred to it as\nthe receptacle of life. It appeared to be the belief of the Dragbora\nthat everything representing the individual could be drawn into the\nseaa-abasa when death approached.\n\nEons ago, the art of artificially reconstructing new bodies into which\nthe organ could be placed, a process constituting literal resurrection,\nhad been lost, but the Dragbora lived in hope of recovering the\nforgotten knowledge. This was their explanation of the preservation of\nthe _seaa-abasa_, each family possessing the vast collection of its\nancestral organs back to the time of the expulsion from their parent\nworld.\n\nWhat basis in fact there was to this theory, the scientists did not\nknow. Apparently, such resurrection had never been accomplished, yet\nwith each death, the _seaa-abasa_ was religiously removed and preserved.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUnderwood felt like some ancient gladiator training for an arena\nbattle, but never had any gladiator fought for such a prize. No\none knew better than he that at the moment he faced Demarzule and\nchallenged the Sirenian, he might face equal and perhaps superior\npowers of destruction, for Demarzule was old in experience.\n\nThere was a defense against it, and to this Underwood turned his\nattention, for it was difficult in function. The _dor-abasa_ had\nthe power to absorb and store the destructive energies. Underwood\ndiscovered it almost by accident when Mason's technicians set up\nequipment for duplicating the destructive force as nearly as possible.\nIt was weak and wholly ineffective, but it acted upon the _dor-abasa_,\nand the organ absorbed it involuntarily.\n\nHe was absolutely confident that they had succeeded in finding the\ngreat weapon for which they had come. The ancient Dragboran-Sirenian\nculture had obviously possessed the force shell as a protection.\nToshmere's words made that plain, but they had misunderstood the\nimplications when he had said, \"They have found a way through the\nbarrier. Our men are falling one by one.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTrained in physical ways of thinking, they had overlooked any such\npossibility as the superior powers of the Dragboran _abasa_.\n\nThere was one other thing that worried Underwood, however, and that\nwas the possibility of producing the effects of the _abasic_ weapon by\nelectronic means. Though the scientists were failing almost completely\nin their attempts to do that, he wondered if perhaps the Terrestrians\nunder Demarzule might not succeed.\n\nIn the scientists' favor, however, was the fact that though he\npossessed a vast reservoir of scientific knowledge, Demarzule was still\nonly the dictator, the politician. He was no scientist.\n\nOn the third day following the operation, Underwood was able to be\nup about the ship for a few moments, though by means of the _abasic_\nsenses he had been actively supervising the work in the laboratory\nduring the entire time.\n\nHe felt his powers growing almost hourly, and the vista of the new\nworld of physical and mental powers into which he was coming was almost\noverwhelming. He sensed other new and untried properties of the organs,\nwhich he dared not experiment with yet. There would be time enough when\nthey reached Earth.\n\nAn accurate watch had been kept on the battle fleet from Earth. Its\nwanton firing of the ancient cities was completed by the time Underwood\nwas able to rise physically from his bed. The observer reported\nthe ships were turning about and returning in the direction of the\n_Lavoisier_.\n\n\"We'd better get into space,\" said Underwood. \"There's no reason for\nstaying here longer, and I don't want them to burn away all our probes\nagain if we can help it. They may try to send a surrender demand or\nsomething of the sort, but let's be in space where we can maneuver when\nthey do it.\"\n\nThe _Lavoisier_ lifted from the surface of the planet, its course set\nfor Earth, more than ninety million light years away.\n\nThe force shell about it glistened in space like a new star, and\nthrough the probes the observers aboard saw the fleet swiftly shift its\ncourse in pursuit.\n\nUnderwood left the ship and let his senses rove through the space\nabout the vessel. He remained like some omnipotent observer in space,\nwhile the shining bubble sped through the heavens. Behind it came the\ntwenty mighty battleships, their acceleration high enough to overtake\nthe _Lavoisier_. Impulsively, Underwood drifted toward the nearest and\nentered through the hull.\n\nIt was the giant flagship, _Creagor_. The Disciples who formed the\nfighting forces were like men reborn. There was none of the blas\u00e9,\ndisillusioned attitude that had been prevalent upon Earth before the\ncoming of Demarzule. Instead, there was a zealous, inspired attitude\nthat frightened Underwood. It was a fanatic, desperate, unhealthy thing.\n\nHe tried to picture the nations of the Earth filled with such men\ndriven by the same kind of unholy inspiration. It sickened him, for\neven if Demarzule were destroyed, the Earth would be no place where a\nsane man could find peace for decades to come. In death, Demarzule\nmight become a martyr and live more strongly than ever in the minds of\nhis followers.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs Underwood moved so strangely among his enemies, he heard occasional\nremarks concerning the _Lavoisier_ and its scientists. Blasphemer and\ninfidel were the mildest terms applied to them.\n\nHe came to the control room, where the Admiral was in conference with\nthe Captain of the flagship.\n\n\"We have our orders, Captain Montrose,\" the Admiral was saying.\n\"Destruction of the ship and all its occupants is to be complete.\"\n\n\"That supersedes the command to take prisoners, then?\"\n\nThe Admiral nodded. \"Orders will be dispatched to all vessels at once.\nWe will make a combined attack with the new force shell disruptor.\"\n\nUnderwood froze at the words. Had Demarzule brought back with him some\nterrible means of penetrating the force shell and rendering it useless?\nThat was absolutely the only defense the _Lavoisier_ had. Her own Atom\nStream projectors would be ineffective against the twenty encircling\nships.\n\nUnderwood heard the orders given. Throughout the flagship an electric\ntension filled the air. It was the first time the weapon had been tried\nagainst an enemy, Underwood supposed. The crewmen were eager with a\nsickening lust to kill.\n\nUnderwood went swiftly through the ship, searching to locate the\nmachines that would be turned upon the helpless laboratory ship. He\nstill didn't quite believe that anything could break down the force\nshell. But when he saw the weapons, he knew that defeat had come for a\ncivilization which had learned to depend upon the force shell for its\nprotection.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe watched the crewmen at the complicated boards that controlled the\ninput of power and the focusing of the radiators upon the distant\ntarget.\n\nUnderwood sped away to the distant _Lavoisier_ to see what effect the\nonslaught was having. The force shell about the ship glowed with the\nfaint, pinkish aura of the twenty beams that converged upon it.\n\nAs he came up there was no apparent effect, but all at once the\nglistening shell grew red in a spot as the force field weakened.\n\nThen Underwood comprehended the means by which the disruptor worked.\nIt did not penetrate the shell. That was an impossibility. But it\nunbalanced the forces that held the field in a shell and caused it\nto rotate. This, in turn, created a tremendous flow of energy through\nthe generators aboard the _Lavoisier_ and shortly would burn them out,\nleaving the ship the defenseless prey of the Atom Streams.\n\nThere was no time to enter the _Lavoisier_ to warn them. Underwood\nreturned with bodiless velocity to the _Creagor_.\n\nThere in the depths of the ship he found the Chief Operator who was\ndirecting those beams toward the _Lavoisier_. With all the power of his\n_abasic_ organs, he hurled a devastating wave of energy into the man's\nnerve channels.\n\nThe result was shocking to one unaccustomed to killing. The man jerked\nupright before his panel, staggered uncertainly, and fell across the\nmaze of switches.\n\nThere was no time for reaction within Underwood at his merciless first\nslaying. The complex machinery of the disruptor sputtered to a halt\namid the clatter of relays.\n\nUnderwood moved into the next sector of the ship where the powerful\nAtom Stream projectors awaited their prey. He carefully extended the\npowers of the _dor-abasa_. It was almost as if he could feel his way\nalong the nerve channels of the operator's mind into the depths of the\nbrain. There he sent forth a sudden, wild command.\n\nThe operator unquestioningly spun the wheels that shifted the\nradiators. They came to rest upon the nearest ship of the fleet.\n\n\"Fire!\" Underwood commanded.\n\nThe operator's fingers closed upon the switches. The Atom Stream\nlashed into space, tore open the vitals of the sister ship and flung\nthe fragments out into space. Some crashed into other ships, battering\nthem, throwing them off course.\n\nFor a moment after the catastrophe, the commanders of the fleet were\nstunned to inactivity, while confusion swept the ranks. The hysterical\ncries of the operator who had pulled the switches filled the room.\n\n\"I didn't do it!\" he screamed. \"Something made me--\"\n\nSome of the ships were still attacking the _Lavoisier_. Underwood\ndidn't know how long they could hold out. He sped to the nearest ship\nwhere there was milder but no less disrupting confusion as news of the\nunexplained disaster filtered down to the lowest astro-man.\n\nUnderwood sought out the fire control chamber. He fingered his way\nalong the nerve channels of the operator and swung the projectors\naround. This time the target was the mighty flagship.\n\nThe operator gasped with horror as the titanic hull came into view in\nhis sights, yet with unerring accuracy his hands moved the radiators to\ncenter exactly on the target.\n\nHis fingers pressed the switches.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSoundlessly, the blossom of flame sprang into being where once had\nbeen the leviathan of space. Viewplates throughout the fleet suddenly\nblacked out in protection against that terrible overload. When they\ncame on again, they showed the drifting, helpless hulk of the rear\nthird of the ship.\n\nThe immediate objective had been accomplished. The disruptor beams\nvanished as the eighteen ships converged upon the black hulks to take\noff any possible survivors.\n\nUnderwood seized the moment and diffused his powers until he\nencompassed the fleet. He spoke and his voice found hearing in every\nman of those mighty ships.\n\n\"Men of Earth! You have sworn allegiance to Demarzule, the Sirenian,\nbecause of his might. Now you will swear allegiance to might that is\ngreat enough to wipe Demarzule from the face of civilization. I have\nkilled your fellows right in your midst, and destroyed two of your\nmightiest ships--yet none of you have seen me. You know not how I come\ninto your midst, nor how it is that every man of every ship can hear\nmy voice at once.\n\n\"You have betrayed your kind to an alien who has destroyed worlds and\nruined Galaxies. You are guilty of the highest treason to mankind. What\nis there that you can do to wipe out such infamy?\n\n\"You can join the forces that will wipe out the monster Demarzule! You\ncan accept the leadership of greater might--or be destroyed. Choose!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a moment of stunned quiet within the ships, then a bedlam\nthat would not die for many minutes.\n\nUnderwood withdrew from the fleet and returned to the control room of\nthe _Lavoisier_. There he found a chaos of despair. Mason had properly\ndiagnosed the weapons the fleet had turned upon the ship.\n\nThough his physical self lay in the sick bay yet, the members of the\ncrew were becoming accustomed to his unexpected voice in their minds.\nQuickly he told them what he had done. When he finished, he said, \"What\ndamage did you suffer, if any, Mason?\"\n\n\"Only two very doubtful generators left. We couldn't stand another\nblast like that. Where did they get such machines?\"\n\n\"I don't know. It's possibly something Toshmere was on the edge of\ndeveloping. Perhaps some of our own men have worked it out with clues\ngiven by Demarzule. There's no telling. The important thing now is that\nwe've got a bear by the tail. For a moment we have the upper hand, but\nI'm not sure just what will happen when they pull themselves together\nagain. If they don't accept my ultimatum, we may be in a spot.\"\n\n\"And if they do--what are we going to do with a whole fleet of fanatics\nand dupes?\"\n\n\"We'll need every ally that we can get now. Undoubtedly word was\nflashed back to Earth of this disaster before I talked to them.\nDemarzule knows we're coming and is aware of the power I have. He'll\nundoubtedly send powerful interceptors to wipe us out. If we can gain\ncontrol of these ships, we can throw them against his interceptors, and\nmaybe sneak through the Terrestrian defenses. It doesn't matter what\nhappens to every one of us--just so I can get close enough to Demarzule\nto tangle with him.\"\n\nAt that moment, Captain Dawson approached Mason. \"Message from the\nfleet. They offer to surrender unconditionally.\"\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER EIGHTEEN_\n\n\nAuxiliary engines were removed from the hulk of the destroyed flagship.\nInstalled in the _Lavoisier_, they could easily bring her speed up to\nthat of the fastest ship in the fleet.\n\nSo with the small laboratory ship, _Lavoisier_, as flagship, the\nravaged and reorganized fleet turned once again toward Earth. As the\nlong days in space passed while they sped Earthward at incredible\nvelocities, the physicists and engineers turned the _Lavoisier_ into a\ndeadly warship, the equal of any in their fleet. New and more powerful\nAtom Stream projectors were installed, and massive disruptor units were\nbuilt into previous areas of more peaceful uses.\n\nAnd while they hurled through the vault of space, Underwood moved from\nship to ship by means of his _abasic_ senses, testing, examining and\nfiltering out the men of the battle crews.\n\nIf he could have afforded pity, all he possessed would have been\nexpended upon them, for they were a pitiable lot. He knew that their\nstandards of values had been scattered again by their defeat at\nhis hands. If their belief in the invincibility of Demarzule, and\nthemselves because they were the Disciples of Demarzule, had not\nbeen so great, their defeat would have been less easy. Underwood was\nthankful for the conceit that rendered them vulnerable when defeat hove\nin sight.\n\nTheir allegiance to him was no stable thing, he knew. But most of them\nwere willing to throw their loyalties with the scientists because they\nhungered for leadership with a neurotic longing, and the power that\ncould silently and unseen wipe out two of the Great One's warships was\nsurely a power to command their respect. So they reasoned in their\nbewildered minds.\n\nUnderwood removed from the key places those who were doubtful and\nrebellious, and he spoke to them daily throughout the long voyage,\nsometimes reasoning, sometimes commanding, but always with a display\nof power that they had to respect. In the end he felt he had a set of\ncrews as trustworthy as Earthmen could be made in this culture of doubt\nand universal disregard of trust and honesty.\n\nHe practised constantly in perfecting the powers of the _abasa_, and\nas his facility grew, so did his regard for the little offshoot of\nDragboran culture that had flourished upon the barren little moon.\nSuch powers as he possessed would have meant suicide to his own race.\nSometimes he wondered if he could himself endure their temptations\nlong enough to accomplish his goal. Certainly, with that completed, he\nwould have the organs removed. Their call to power, wealth, and the\nmisappropriation were almost more than any human mind in this\nstage of evolution could endure.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAlmost in Earth's own front yard, at the orbit of Mars, the first\nsigns of the coming struggle appeared. The lookout called his warning.\nA score of fast interceptors were leaving Earth, headed in their\ndirection.\n\nUnderwood wished that he'd paid more attention to the military arts. He\ndared trust none of the warriors who were his by conquest, for he could\nnot appear to be less than they in any respect. But neither he nor any\nof the other scientists were competent to lead a complex military unit,\nsuch as his fleet represented, into the vortex of battle.\n\nYet he must do what had to be done. He formed the fleet into a massive\ntactical cylinder with the _Lavoisier_ at the center and the remainder\nof the ships at the periphery. There would be no fancy maneuvering,\nonly blunt, smashing force, every erg of it that could be generated\nwithin the hulls of those warships.\n\nThe entropy dissipators were already at work absorbing a fraction of\nthe momentum that had carried the fleet across the reaches of space,\nbut as it drove into the heart of the Solar System, its velocity was\nstill immeasurable by Solarian standards.\n\nThe interceptors were powerless to match that speed in so short a time,\nbut one wave approached on a near collision course, with the fury of\nall its disruptors and Atom Streams bearing upon the fleet.\n\nThe effect was negligible, however, as the fleet smashed by, its own\nweapons flaming.\n\nBut that passage meant nothing. If the _Lavoisier_ were to attempt\na landing, it couldn't continue to hurl by at such velocities, for\nalready it was passing Earth.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUnderwood, though, was satisfied as he opened his physical eyes in the\ncontrol room and abandoned the _abasic_ senses for a return to his\nnormal self.\n\n\"I'm sure my useful range with these powers is at least eighty thousand\nmiles. Jandro ought to have been able to examine the Dragboran planet\nby means of the _abasa_, but maybe he didn't realize it. I know that\nmy own range is increasing constantly.\"\n\n\"What do you intend to do?\" asked Terry. \"Are you going to try a\nlanding or attack Demarzule without going down?\"\n\n\"I believe we'll be safer to remain in space. If we can maneuver into\nan orbit of fifty thousand miles or so from Earth, and can hold off\nthe attacks long enough for me to find Demarzule, that ought to be our\ngreatest chance of success. If we landed we'd be sitting ducks.\"\n\nThere was general agreement with Underwood's estimate, though no one\naboard the ship felt very much confidence in their ability to hold off\nthe attacks they knew were coming. They kept reminding themselves that\nit was not important to save themselves or their ships. What mattered\nto give Underwood an adequate opportunity to hurl the powers of the\n_abasic_ weapons at Demarzule. After that, chance would have to take\ncare of the rest.\n\nThe hurtling projectile turned long after it had passed Earth. The\nentropy dissipators absorbed the flaming energy of the ships' flight\nand dispersed it into space to recreate the infinitesimal particles\nthat had been broken down to obtain that energy.\n\nSo, as the fleet braked its momentum and turned into an\never-tightening spiral, the interceptors swept down once more.\n\nThe thundering mass that was the fleet held its course now. Torrents\nof energy, slashed from the hearts of incalculable numbers of atoms,\nwashed into space from the throats of the great radiators aboard the\nbattleships. Three of the interceptors went down in that barrage before\ntheir own force shields went up.\n\nIt became a fantastic battle between almost irresistible forces. Both\nthe Atom Stream and the disruptor beams could be fired only through a\nhiatus in the force shell, but such an opening was itself vulnerable\nto the enemy fire of Atom Streams. Therefore, the technique of warfare\nbetween similarly armed forces consisted of rapidly shifting the attack\nfrom radiator to radiator in a given vessel, so that no single opening\nwould exist long enough for the enemy to concentrate fire upon that\nspot.\n\nThe interceptors were too small to mount the equipment for such defense\ntactics. Their only value lay in maneuverability. Slashing across the\nlanes of the battleships, their beams could cross the radiator pattern\nin unpredictable courses. The laws of chance were sometimes with them\nand their Atom Streams struck an opening directly. Regardless of the\nspeed of closing the hiatus, such a coincidence was sufficient to\ndestroy the ship. And so Underwood and his companions, watching, saw\none of their great battleships explode in a nova of atomic fire as such\na hit was scored upon it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe interceptor itself was fired an instant later by the concentrated\nfire of the two adjacent battleships, but its loss was negligible to\nthe enemy. The interceptors were expendable, expendable for now another\nscore were seen leaving the rim of Earth and taking up the pursuit of\nthe fleet.\n\nBut it was not their approach that caused the hearts of the men aboard\nthe _Lavoisier_ to quail. Behind them, slowly and ponderously, rose a\nterrible fleet of fifty dreadnaughts with vast firepower.\n\n\"What's our orbital radius at present?\" Underwood demanded abruptly of\nthe navigator.\n\n\"Sixty thousand.\"\n\n\"Take it, Mason,\" Underwood said. \"I'm going down.\"\n\nThe impact of that moment hit them all, though they had been trying to\nanticipate it since they had first known that it would come. It was\nnot their regard and friendship for Underwood, who might presently die\nbefore their eyes. It was not their own almost extinction before the\nfire of the invincible fleet rising to do battle.\n\nIt was that this moment would decide the course of man's history.\n\nEverything depended upon a single strange weapon snatched from the\nhands of a forgotten people in a little eddy of civilization, whose\nsole purpose in existence might have been to carry this weapon through\ntime to this moment.\n\nAnd only one of them could wield that weapon, while the others stood\nby, neither knowing the progress of that conflict nor able to assist.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUnderwood sat down in the deep chair that would hold his body restfully\nwhile his _abasic_ senses swept Earthward to envelop and crush the\nanachronism that he had turned upon civilization.\n\nIt was more than just, more than ironic, he thought. It was his high\nprivilege to wipe out some of the guilt that he knew he could never\nsmother or rationalize out of his mind--the guilt of having been the\none to bring Demarzule back to life.\n\nOf them all in that control room, only Illia uttered a sound, and hers\nwas a half audible cry choked back before it was fully spoken.\n\nHe lay apparently relaxed with eyes closed in the huge chair in the\ncontrol room of the _Lavoisier_, but the essence, the force that was\nDelmar Underwood, was sixty thousand miles away, hovering over the\nforce shell dome that hid the Carlson Museum.\n\nSimultaneously with Illia's cry there came a smashing alarm that rang\nthrough the room with its insistent, murderous message.\n\n\"We're hit! Number three and four shell generators have gone out!\"\n\nAs Underwood held to the point of view of the advancing wave-front of\nperception, he had the sensation of diving headlong toward the throng\nthat was gathering as if by magic about the white, shining columns\nof the building. As if knowing of the battle that was to be fought\nbetween the titans, the waiting thousands had gathered when the force\nshell went over the Carlson and the battle fleets took to space. They\nwatched, waiting for the unknown, the unexpected, somehow sensing their\ndestiny was being decided.\n\nSight of the milling thousands was lost to Underwood as he plunged deep\nbelow the protecting shell over the building as if it did not exist.\nThe lightlessness inside the shell was broken by the blaze of lights\nthat showered their radiance everywhere upon the grounds and museum\nthat had become a monstrous palace.\n\nWaiting, hesitant guards and servants moved about the grounds,\ngathering in knots to ask one another what the appearance of the\nbattleships and the sudden use of the shell meant. It was inconceivable\nthat anyone should be challenging the Great One, but the very\nimprobability of it filled them with fearful dismay.\n\nUnderwood entered the building. The vast assemblage of instruments and\nmachines that had filled the main hall when he last saw it was gone\nnow, replaced with rich paintings and fabulous tapestries had been\nransacked from the treasuries of the Earth.\n\nThere was no one in sight. Underwood continued on until he came to the\nseries of large exhibition rooms toward the rear. Here, apparently,\nwere set up administrative offices to maintain whatever personal\ncontact was necessary between Demarzule and the Disciples he ruled.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen Underwood came to the central room at the rear of the center\nsection of the building. Demarzule was there.\n\nIt was with an involuntary shock that Underwood saw again the alien\ncreature he had restored to life. As he sat in the throne-like chair\nin the center of one wall of the room, the Great One seemed like some\nsculpture of an ancient god of evil executed in weathered bronze. Only\nthe startling white of his eyes gave evidence of life in that enormous\nbulk.\n\nUnderwood hadn't expected the twenty Earthmen who sat near Demarzule,\nforming a semi-circle with the Great One in the center, as if in\ncouncil. They sat in brooding silence. Not a word seemed to be passing\nbetween them, and Underwood watched in wonderment.\n\nThen, slowly, Demarzule stirred. His white staring eyes moved, as\nthough searching the room. His words came to Underwood.\n\n\"So you have come at last,\" he said. \"You challenge Demarzule the Great\nOne with your feeble powers. I know you, Delmar Underwood. They tell\nme it was you who found and restored me. I owe you much, and I would\nhave offered you a high place in my realm which shall encompass the\nUniverse. Yet you set yourself against me.\n\n\"I am merciful. You may still have your place if you choose. I need one\nsuch as you, just as I needed the brain and hands of Toshmere, who was\nso foolish as to think he could be the one to conquer the eons in my\nplace. You know of his fate, I am sure.\"\n\nDemarzule's speech was a paralyzing shock. Underwood had made no\nrevelation of himself, yet the alien had detected his presence. Through\nthe _abasa_, he sensed the might and power of Demarzule, the full\npotentialities that lay in the three organs that the ancient race had\ndeveloped, potentialities that he had scarcely touched in the short\nweeks of experimentation.\n\nIt made him sick for an instant with the fear of almost certain defeat.\nThen he struck, furiously, and with all the power that was in him.\n\nNever before had he hurled such a bolt of devastation. With\nsatisfaction he sensed Demarzule's powers sway and wither before its\nblast, but the Great One absorbed it and recovered after an instant.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You are a worthy opponent,\" said Demarzule. \"You have accomplished\nmuch in so short a time, but not enough, I fear. Once more I extend my\noffer to join me. As my lieutenant, you might become governor of many\nGalaxies.\"\n\nUnderwood remained silent, conserving his forces for another blast\nwhich Demarzule could surely not endure. He hurled it and felt the\nenergies flowing from him in a life-destroying stream. Demarzule's\nbronze face was only smiling sardonically as he met that attack--and\nabsorbed it.\n\n\"When you have exhausted yourself thoroughly,\" he said, \"I shall\ndemonstrate my own powers--but slowly, so that death will not be too\nquick for you.\"\n\nThe use of such waves of force was exhausting to Underwood, but he knew\nthat Demarzule's absorptive organ should soon reach maximum capacity,\nif it were not allowed to drain away in the meantime.\n\nA third time he blasted. Then sudden, terrible realization came that\nDemarzule was not absorbing the energy. It was being diverted, drawn\naside before it even approached the Sirenian.\n\nIn something approaching panic, Underwood directed his senses to locate\nthe source of the diversion, and found it in the twenty Earthmen\nsitting motionlessly about Demarzule.\n\nDemarzule seemed to know the instant that Underwood became aware of\nthe fact. \"Yes,\" he said, \"we have duplicated the _abasa_. Cancer is\nplentiful among you. In five thousand more years you would have stopped\nfighting it and learned how to use it. There are twenty of us. You\nwould not have come had you known you would have that many to fight\nsinglehanded, would you? Now it is too late!\"\n\nWith that word, a wave, of paralyzing, destroying force swept over\nUnderwood. How it was affecting him, what senses it was attacking, he\ndid not know. He only knew that a flaming agony was burning out life,\nas if reluctant to give him a speedy, merciful death.\n\nHe must withdraw to the ship to recover his forces. He could never\nwithstand the attack of twenty-one _abasas_.\n\nUnderwood relaxed and threw his powers back toward the ship--and failed!\n\nAbruptly, the metallic glint of Demarzule's lips parted in a roar of\nlaughter without merriment, but of triumph.\n\n\"No, my brave Earthling, you cannot retreat. You did not know that.\nFor those who would challenge the Great One there is no retreat. Your\ndecision is made, and you will fail and you will die--but only when I\nwish, and your fellow Earthmen will find amusement in toying with you\nas a cat with a mouse before I give the final blow that will destroy\nyour rash, impatient ego.\"\n\nThe flaming fire of Demarzule's attack continued while Underwood fought\nsavagely and vainly to retreat. How was he being held there against his\nefforts to retreat? He did not know that the _abasa_ held such powers\nand he would not have known how to exert them himself if he had been\naware of them.\n\nHe gave up and turned back, letting the power flow into the absorptive\ncells of the _dor-abasa_, but it could not be for long, for the organ\nwould disrupt under such stress.\n\nThen, as if in keeping with his promise to prolong the agony, the\nattack ceased, and Demarzule allowed him to rest.\n\n\"You were brash, were you not?\" he taunted. \"How could you dare come\nagainst the mightiest power of the Universe, the greatest mind ever\ncreated, and attack with your puny powers? You blaspheme the Great One\nby your presumption!\"\n\n\"Once, long ago,\" said Underwood, \"the Sirenian forces were defeated by\nthe Dragbora. Again it is the Dragbora you face, Demarzule. Remember\nthat, and defend yourself!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUnderwood was startled. Incredibly, it seemed that he had not spoken\nthose words, but rather that the dead Jandro was with him, silently\nbacking him, teaching, advising--.\n\nHe lashed out, but not at Demarzule. He struck swiftly at the nearest\nEarthman. Almost instantly, the unfortunate shuddered and fell to the\nfloor, dead. In quick succession Underwood struck at the nerve cells of\nthe next five and they died without sound.\n\nIn snarling fury and retaliation, Demarzule retaliated. Underwood\nabsorbed the blow--and incredibly hurled it back.\n\nIt was as if he had suddenly become aware of techniques that he had\nnever dreamed of. He had not known it was possible to absorb the\nnerve-destroying force with his own _dor-abasa_ and whip it back upon\nthe attacker, like a ball caught and thrown.\n\nIt hardly seemed as if he were acting through his own volition, yet he\nacted. He felt the surprise of Demarzule, and in that moment he knew\nthe secret. The Earthmen apparently possessed only a single primitive\norgan, hardly identifiable as one of the _abasa_, for they had the\ncapacity for defense, but not for attack. Four more of them toppled,\nand then Underwood was forced to face the attack of Demarzule again.\n\nSomething like terror had entered the mind of the alien now. Underwood\nsensed the thoughts of possible defeat that flooded Demarzule's mind.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Remember that day on _Vorga_?\" Underwood asked. \"Remember how the\nDragboran powers pierced the great force shell you flung about the\nplanet? Remember how your men fell one by one, and their weapons\nwent cold and the force shell dropped for lack of control? Remember,\nDemarzule, it was the Dragbora you fought that day, and it is the\nDragbora you fight now. I have not come to challenge as a puny\nEarthman. I come as a Dragboran--to complete the unfinished task of my\nancestors!\"\n\nThe Sirenian was silent and new confidence filled Underwood. He felt\nthat he was not fighting alone, that all of the ancient Dragboran\ncivilization was behind him, battling its age-old enemies to\nextinction. He felt as if Jandro himself were there.\n\nThe energy he absorbed from Demarzule he turned upon the cohorts, who\nsat as if frozen with fear as they watched their fellows slump and fall\nto the floor in soundless death.\n\nIn near-madness, Demarzule increased his attacks. He adopted a\nshifting, feinting attack that shocked Underwood's _abasa_ with each\nsurging wave of force. But Underwood learned how to control those\nsurges, to pass them on to his own attacks, which still were directed\nupon the Earthmen within the chamber.\n\nWithin moments of each other, the last two on either side of Demarzule\nfell. The Sirenian seemed not to have noticed, for all his energies and\nconcentration now were directed at Underwood.\n\nUnderwood was tiring swiftly. The energies draining out of him seemed\nas if they were sapping every cell of his being, and back on board the\n_Lavoisier_, every spasm of torture was reflected involuntarily on his\nphysical face. Those who watched suffered for him.\n\nIllia sat in a corner of the room opposite him and her fists pressed\nwhite spots into her cheeks. Dreyer's nervous reaction was expressed\nin the incessant puffs and chewing on his normally steady cigar. The\nothers merely watched with taut faces and teeth sinking into their lips.\n\nIn the chamber of the great museum palace, the tempo of the battle was\nslowly building up. Though he felt exhausted almost to the point of\ndefeat, Underwood strained for more energy and found that it was at his\ncommand. His _dor-abasa_ fed upon the attacking force of Demarzule and\nreturned it with added energy potential.\n\nIn each of them, the same process was going on, and the outcome would\nbe determined by the final resultant flow of destroying power.\n\nHe could retreat now, Underwood realized. He doubted that Demarzule\ncould exert a holding force upon him, but nothing would be gained by\nabandoning the battle now. He drove on with increasing surges.\n\nSuddenly there was a faltering and Underwood exulted within himself.\nDemarzule's force wavered for the barest fraction of an instant, and it\nwas not a feint.\n\n\"You are old and weak,\" said Underwood. \"Half a million years ago,\ncivilization rejected you. _We reject you!_\"\n\nHe smashed on almost without hindrance now. Demarzule's great form\nwrithed in pain upon the throne--and fought with one desperate surge of\nenergy.\n\nUnderwood caught and hurled it back mercilessly. He felt his way into\nthe innermost recesses of the Sirenian mind, groped along the nerve\nways of the Great One. And as he went, he burned and destroyed the\nvital synapses.\n\nDemarzule was dying--slowly, because of his resistance--and in endless\npain because there was no other way. He screamed aloud in ultimate\nagony, and then the giant figure of Demarzule, the Sirenian--the Great\nOne--crashed to the floor.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe relief that came to Underwood was near agony. The wild forces of\nthe Dragbora tore relentlessly from him and filled the room with their\nlethal energy before they died.\n\nThen, in greater calm, he regarded what he had done. It was finished,\nalmost unbelievably finished.\n\nYet there were a few things to do. He left the building and sought\nout the guards and the caretakers and whispered into their minds,\n\"Demarzule is dead! The Great One has died and you are men once more.\"\n\nHe sought out the controls of the force shell and caused the operator\nto drop the shield. Then he whispered, \"The Great One is dead,\" and\nlike the wind, his voice encompassed the vast thousands who had\ngathered.\n\nThe message sank unspoken into their minds and each man looked at\nhis neighbor as if to ask how it had come. They pressed forward,\na battling, maddened mob who had for an hour lived in a childish,\nprimitive world where men were not required to think but only to obey.\nThey pushed forward and flowed into the building, battering, clawing\none another. But they managed to view the body of the fallen Sirenian,\nso that the message was confirmed and spread, soon to circle the Earth.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUnderwood studied the writhing, bewildered mass. Could Dreyer possibly\nbe right? Would it ever end--men's unthinking grasping for leadership,\ntheir mindless search for kings and gods, while within them their own\npowers withered? Always it had been the same; leaders arose holding\nbefore men the illusion of vast, glorious promises while they carefully\nled them into hells of lost dreams and broken promises.\n\nYes, it would be different, Underwood told himself. The Dragbora had\nproved that it could be different. Their origin could have been no less\nlowly than man's. They must have trodden the same tortuous stairway to\ndreams that man was now on, and they had learned how to live with one\nanother.\n\nMan was already nearer that goal--far nearer now that Demarzule was\ndead. Underwood formed a silent prayer that fate would be merciful to\nman and not send another like Demarzule.\n\nAnd he allowed himself a moment's pride, an instant of pleasure in the\nthought that he had been able to take part in the crisis.\n\nWith a final pity for the scene below, he fled back into space. What\nhe saw there turned him sick with fear. The great fleet was broken\nand burned with atomic fires. Only two of the battleships remained\nto challenge the attackers. But they were no longer challenging.\nThey signalled abject surrender and were fallen upon by ravenous\ninterceptors.\n\nThe _Lavoisier_ herself was darkened and drifting, her force shell\nfeeble and waning, while the flaming disruptors of a trio of\ndreadnaughts concentrated upon her.\n\nUnderwood hurled himself toward the nearest of the enemy ships. In its\ndepths he sought out the gunners and cut off life in them before they\nwere aware of his bodiless presence. Swiftly he turned their beams upon\neach other and watched them wallow and disappear in sudden flame.\n\nOthers rushed forward now. Still more than a score of them to defeat\nthe single crippled laboratory ship, more than he could hope to conquer\nin time.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut they did not fire. Their shields remained intact; then slowly their\ncourses changed and they drifted away. Without comprehension, Underwood\npeered into those hulls and knew the answer.\n\nThe news had come to them of Demarzule's death. Like men in pursuit\nof a mirage, they could not endure the reality that came with the\nvanishing of their dream. Their defeat was utter and complete.\nThroughout the Earth Demarzule's defeat was the defeat of all men\nwho had not yet become strong enough to walk in the sun of their own\ndecisions, but clung to the shadow of illusory leadership.\n\nUnderwood swept back toward the darkened _Lavoisier_. He moved like\na ghost through its bleak halls and vacant corridors. Down in the\ngenerator rooms, he found the cause of the disaster in the blasted\nremains of overburdened force shell generators. Four of them must\nhave given way at once, ripping the ship throughout its length with\nconcussion and lethal waves.\n\nThe control room was dark, like the rest of the ship, and the forms of\nhis companions were strewn upon the floor. But there was life yet and\nhe dared to hope as he spoke to their minds, insistent, commanding,\nforcing life and consciousness back into their nerve cells. He seemed\nto become aware of unknown powers of resurrection that dwelt within his\nown being.\n\nHis mission was complete. He returned to his own physical form and\nabandoned the _abasic_ senses. He sat there in the huge chair in the\ncontrol room, while those about him revived and life gradually returned\nto the dying ship. Of the enemy fleet there was no more, for it was\ndescending to an Earth shorn of the hope of Galaxy-wide conquest.\n\nThey did not know yet where they would go or where they could find\nrefuge, but when the wreckage was cleared and the ship lived again,\nUnderwood and Illia stood alone in a darkened observation pit, watching\nthe stars slip across the massive arc of the screens.\n\nAs Underwood watched, he thought he sensed something of the drive that\nmight have whipped Demarzule's brain, the goad that made vast superior\npowers intolerable in the possession of even a beneficent man, for he\nwould no longer remain beneficent.\n\nBy the might that was in him he had vanquished the Great One! He could\nstand in the place of the Great One if he chose! He did not know if his\npowers were becoming greater than those of Jandro, like a strengthened\nplant in new soil, but surely they were growing. The secrets of the\nUniverse seemed to be appearing before him, one by one.\n\nA mere glance at a slab of inert matter, and his senses could delve\ninto the composition of its atoms and sort out and predict its\nproperties and reactions. One look into the far spaces beyond the Solar\nSystem and he could sense himself soaring in eternity. Yes, he was\ngrowing in power and perception, and where it might lead, he dared not\nlook.\n\nBut there were other things to be had, other, simpler ambitions in\nwhich common men had found fulfillment throughout the ages.\n\nIllia was warm against him, soft in his arms.\n\n\"I want you to operate again, as quickly as possible,\" he said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe looked up at him with a start. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"You must take out the _abasic_ organs. They've served their purpose.\nI don't want to live with them. I could become another Demarzule with\nthe power I have.\"\n\nHer eyes were faintly blue in the light that came from the panel and\nthey were intent upon him. In them he read something that made him\nafraid.\n\n\"There is always a need for men with greater powers and greater\nknowledge than the average man,\" she said. \"The race has need of its\nmutants. They are dealt so sparingly to us that we cannot afford not to\nutilize them.\"\n\n\"_Mutants?_\"\n\n\"You are a true mutant, whether artificial or not, possessing organs\nand abilities that are unique. The race needs them. You cannot ask me\nto destroy them.\"\n\nHe had never thought of himself as a mutant, yet she was right for\nall practical purposes. His powers and perceptions would perhaps not\nhave been produced naturally in any man of his race for thousands of\nyears to come. Perhaps he _could_ use them to assist man's slow rise.\nA new wealth of science, a new strength of leadership and guidance if\nnecessary--.\n\n\"I could become the world's greatest criminal,\" he said. \"There's no\nsecret, no property that's safe from my grasp. I have only to reach out\nfor possessions, for power.\"\n\n\"You worry too much about that,\" she said lightly. \"You could no more\nbecome a villain than I could.\"\n\n\"Why are you so sure of that?\"\n\n\"Don't you remember the properties of the _seaa-abasa_? But then you\ndidn't hear the last words that Jandro ever spoke, did you? He said, 'I\nretire to the _seaa-abasa_.' Do you know what that means?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSuddenly, Underwood felt cold. A score of whisperings came thundering\ninto his mind. The moment when he had first awakened from the\noperation, when it seemed as if death would have him and only the power\nof a demanding will had helped him cling to life. The voice that seemed\nto penetrate and call him back. The voice of Jandro. And then the final\nconflict in the chambers of Demarzule.\n\nNew skills and new strength had suddenly come to him as if out of\nnowhere. He had been conceited to call it his increased experience\nand ability. Yet could it have come from outside himself? He sought\nfrantically and urgently within his own nerve channels, in the cells of\nhis own being, and in the pathways of the alien organs that lent him\nthose unearthly senses. There seemed nothing but an echo, as if within\na great empty hall. There was no answer, yet it seemed as if down\nthose channels of perception there was the dim shadow of a wary prey\nwho could never be caught, who could never be found in those endless\npathways, but who would never be far away.\n\nUnderwood knew then that if it was Jandro, he would never make himself\nknown for reasons of his own, perhaps. But there was a sudden peace as\nif he had found some secret purification, as if he had been taken to\na high place and looked about the world and had been able to turn his\nback upon it. Whether he would ever find Jandro or not, he was sure\nthat the guardian was there.\n\nIllia was saying, \"I can't operate, Del. Even if you hate me for the\nrest of our lives, I won't do it. And there is no one else in the world\nwho would know how. You would be killed if you let anyone else attempt\nto cut those nerves. Tell me that you believe I'm right.\"\n\n\"I do,\" he said in cheerful resignation. \"But don't forget it's half\nyour funeral as well. It means that you're going to have to spend the\nrest of your life with a mutant.\"\n\nShe turned her face up to his. \"I can think of worse fates.\"\n\n\nEND\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Alien, by Raymond F.

It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
