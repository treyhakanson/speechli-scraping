A year of 458 days,\ntwenty-six hours each. Moderate seasonal changes, axial tilt less than\nEarth's, orbit less elliptical. See the smallness of the north polar\nice cap? The equatorial region--much too hot; the rest is subtropical\nto temperate. We should go down (if we do) near the 50th\nparallel--north, I'd say. Too much desert in the southern hemisphere.\nMight be hot winds, sandstorms.\"\n\n\"The red-green _is_ vegetation?\" Dr. Christopher Wright teetered on\nlong legs before the screen, a classroom mannerism unchanged by eleven\nyears in the wilderness of space. He pinched and pulled the skin on\nhis Adam's apple, his hawk's-beak, small-chinned head jutting forward\nwith an awkwardness not aggressive but intent. Paul Mason thought:\n_You love him or hate him. In either case he's never quite grotesque._\nWright's too-soft voice insisted: \"It _is_, of course?\"\n\n\"It has to be, Doc,\" Spearman said, and rubbed his bluish cheeks,\nlooking older than his thirty-two years. Already he showed frontal\nbaldness, deeply bracketed mouth corners. On Spearman's big shoulders\nwas the burden of the ship. Watching him now, Paul Mason was troubled\nby a familiar thought: _Captain Jensen should not have died_.... \"It\nhas to be. The instruments show oxygen in Earth proportion, or\nsomewhat richer, plus nitrogen and carbon dioxide. The camera gives us\ntree shadows in these latest photographs with the stronger lens. The\nair may make us oxygen-happy--if we go down.... Well, Dorothy--two\ncontinents, two oceans, both smaller than the Atlantic, connected\nnarrowly at north and south polar regions. Dozens of lakes bigger than\nthe Caspian. The proportion of land to water surface works out nearly\nthe same as on Earth. No mountains to match the Himalayas, but some\npretty high ranges. Unlimited forest, prairie, desert.\" He closed\nbloodshot eyes, pressing the lids. Paul Mason thought: _I should never\ntry to paint Ed. The portrait would always come out as Hercules\nFrustrated, and he wouldn't care for it...._ Spearman said, \"Even most\nof the tallest mountains look smooth--old. If there were glaciers it\nwas a long time ago.\"\n\n\"Geologically a quiet phase,\" Sears Oliphant remarked. \"As Earth\nlooked in the Jurassic and may look again.\" Born fifty years ago in\nTel Aviv, brought up in London, Rio, and New York because his parents\nwere medical trouble shooters for the Federation, and possessed of a\ndoctorate in biology (more exactly, taxonomy) from Johns Hopkins,\nSears Oliphant claimed that his original Polish name could not have\nbeen spelled with the aid of two dictionaries and a crowbar. His fat\nface blinked at Dorothy with little kind eyes. \"I forget, sugar--you\nweren't around in the Jurassic, were you?\"\n\n\"Maybe.\" Her slow smile was for Paul. \"As a very early mammal.\"\n\nWright said, \"No artifacts.... At first it looked like Venus.\" His\ncrinkled asymmetrical face probed at them with a wistful half smile\nlike a child's. \"May we call this planet Lucifer, son of the morning?\nAnd if we land and found a city (or am I being ridiculous?)--let it be\nJensen City, in honor of a more-than-solar myth.\"\n\nShading closed lids, Spearman said with harshness, \"Myth?\"\n\n\"Why, Ed, yes--like all remembered heroes who continue in the love of\nothers, a love that magnifies. How else would you have it?\"\n\n\"But\"--Ann Bryan was high-voiced, troubled--\"Lucifer----\"\n\n\"My dear, Lucifer was an angel. Devils and angels have a way of\nturning out to be the same organism. I noticed that first when I was a\ndamned interne. I noticed it again when I switched to anthropology. I\neven noticed it on a space ship with the five persons I love best....\nNo artifacts, huh?\"\n\nDorothy said, \"You haven't seen these latest pictures, Doc.\"\n\n\"Something?\" Wright hurried over, gray eyes wide and sparkling. \"I'd\nquit hoping.\" Ann joined him, quick-motioned in her slimness, too\ntaut. Wright slipped an elderly arm around her. \"Parallel lines, in\njungle? Ah.... Now, why none in the open ground?\"\n\nSpearman suggested: \"We could take more shots. But....\"\n\nPaul Mason broke the darkening silence. \"But what, Ed?\"\n\n\"We're falling, some. I could move us out into a self-sustaining orbit\nby using more of the reaction mass. We have none to waste. Jensen's\ndeath eleven years ago----\" Spearman shook his gaunt but heavy head.\n\"Thirty pre-calculated accelerations--and the rest periods they\nallowed us were insufficient, I think. You remember what wrecks we\nwere when it was finished; that's why I tried to allow more time in\ndeceleration.\" His brassy voice slowed, fetching out words with care:\n\"The last acceleration, as you know, was not pre-calculated. Jensen\nwas already dead (must have been heart) when his hand took us out of\nautomatic, made another acceleration that damn near flattened us----\"\n\n\"Still here though.\" Sears Oliphant chuckled and patted his middle.\n\"We made it, didn't we, boy?\" It sounded a little forced.\n\n\"In deceleration I had to allow for the big step Jensen never meant;\nmore of the mass was used to correct a deflection. Same allowance must\nbe made in returning, not to mention the biggest drain of all--getting\nout of gravity here, a problem not present at the spaceport. Oh, it's\nplanned for--she's built to do it, even from a heavier planet than\nthis. But after she's done it the margin for return will be--narrower\nthan I care to think.\"\n\nDorothy, small and soft, leaned back in Paul's arms. Her even voice\nwas for everyone in the control room: \"Nevertheless we'll go down.\"\n\nSpearman gazed across at her without apparent comprehension. He went\non, deliberate, harassed: \"Here's a thing I never told you. In that\naccidental acceleration the ship did not respond normally: the\ndeflection happened then, and it may have been due to a defect in the\nbuilding of _Argo_, a fault in the tail jets. At the time, it was all\nI could do to reach Jensen before I blacked out--I still don't know\nhow I ever managed it. Later I tried to think there could be no\ndefect. The forward jets took care of us nicely in deceleration. Until\nwe start braking, we can't know. Indicators _say_ everything's all\nright down there. Instruments can lie. Lord, they've sweated out\natomic motors since before 1960, almost a century now--and we're still\nkids playing with grown-up toys.\"\n\nSears smiled into plump hands. \"So I must be sure to pack my\nmicroscope in one of the lifeboats--hey?\"\n\n\"You're for landing, then.\"\n\nSears nodded. Ann Bryan thrust thin ivory fingers into her loose black\nhair. \"_I_ couldn't take another eleven years.\" She attempted a smile.\n\"Tell me, somebody--tell me there'll be music on Lucifer--a way to\nmake new strings for my violin before I forget everything....\"\n\nDorothy said, \"Land.\" Gently, as one might say time for lunch. And she\nadded: \"We'll find strings, Nan.\"\n\n\"Land, of course,\" said Christopher Wright, preoccupied; his long\nfinger tapped on the photograph; his lips went on moving silently,\ncarrying through some private meditation. \"Land. Give protoplasm a\nchance.\"\n\n\"Land,\" Paul Mason said. _Did anyone suppose the First Interstellar\nwould just turn around and go home? We're here, aren't we...?_\n\nThrough hours when spoken words were few, inner words riotous, Lucifer\nturned an evening face. A morning descent might have been pleasanter\nin human terms, but the calculator, churning its mathematical brew,\nsaid the time was now.\n\nPaul Mason squirmed into his pilot's seat. It was good, he thought,\nthat they could at least meet the challenge of the unexplored with\nadequate bodies. Wright was dryly indestructible; Ed Spearman a gaunt\nmonolith; the plumpness of Sears Oliphant had nothing flabby. The\nwomen were in the warm vigor of a youth that had never known illness.\nAs for his own body, Paul felt for it now a twinge of amused\nadmiration, as if he were seeing an animated statue by an artist\nbetter than himself: slender, tough, nothing too much, built for\nendurance and speed--it would serve. Spearman was already talking in\nthe earphones: \"Close lock. Retract shield.\" Paul responded from\ningrained training. Beyond the window that would give him forward\nvision in the (impossible) event he had to fly the lifeboat, the\nheavens opened. Withdrawal of the shield into the belly of the mother\nship _Argo_ was a dream motion within a wider dream. Dorothy and\nWright were strapped in the two seats behind him: half of _Argo's_\nhuman treasure was here. \"Go over what you do if you have to drive\noff. Over.\"\n\n\"Lever for release. No action till wing-lock indicator is green. No\njet unless to correct position. In atmosphere handle as glider, jet\nonly in emergency. Over.\" After all, Paul considered, he had had a\nthousand hours of atmospheric flying, and two years' drill on these\nboats. Ed could worry less and save wind. Beautiful mechanisms in\ntheir own right, Model L-46, lying eleven years secret but alert in\nthe streamlined blisters, powered by charlesite to avoid the ponderous\nshielding still necessary for atomic motors--and charlesite, perfected\nonly thirty years ago in 2026, was obedient stuff. In space, the boats\nwere small rocket ships; in atmosphere, gliders or low-speed jet\nplanes. While _Argo_ had been in the long ordeal of building, Paul had\nbeen shot from gleaming tubes like this into the atmosphere of Earth,\nthe blind depth at the spaceport, the desolate thin air of Mars.\nSpearman said, \"Turning in five minutes.\"\n\nIn the port lifeboat Ann and Sears would be waiting, but that lock\nwould be open, for Ed must be in the control room. If they had to\nabandon ship (ridiculous!) Ed's boat would be many moments behind.\n\nThe stars moved. \"Paul--check straps. Over.\"\n\nPaul glanced behind him. \"All set. Over.\"\n\nThe forward jets spoke once, and softly. Spearman said, \"Out of orbit.\nWe start braking sooner than you think. Then we'll know....\"\n\nThe depth of quiet was a depth of eternity. Time to reflect--to\nmarvel, if you wished. One hundred and eleven years since Hiroshima,\nwhich the inveterate insanity of history textbooks sometimes referred\nto as a great experiment. Eighty-five years since the first-manned\nspaceport; seventy since the founding of stations on Luna and Mars.\nBut to Paul Mason a greater marvel was the responding warmth of the\nwoman, the brooding charity of the old man, whose lives were upheld\nwith him in this silent nothing, dependent on the magic bundle of\nmuscle and nerve that was himself. _What is love?_\n\nThe greater spaceport had been twelve years in building. Then _Argo_.\nMore than a century from early rocket experiments to the mile-long\nfactories turning out charlesite. In that century man had even added\nto his morsels of self-knowledge a trifle more than he possessed in\nthe days of flint ax and reeking cave. \"We are in atmosphere,\" said\nthe earphones.... _Time: a cerebral invention? How long is a May fly's\nlife to a May fly...?_ \"Braking starts in forty-five seconds. Warn the\nothers.\"\n\nPaul shoved down the mouthpiece, echoing the message. Wright said,\n\"Six pushed-around people. The arrogance of man! Doing fine, Paul.\"\n\nPressure--not too bad. A long roaring. But then the stars....\n\nThe stars went mad. A glare--a cruel second of the light of the star\nthat was now the sun and a flicker of red-green, not real. The roaring\npaused. Stopped.\n\nThe earphones screamed: \"Release! _Drive off!_\"\n\n\"Releasing.\" The amused voice was Paul's own. \"Good luck, Ed.\"\n\nNo answer. There was still such a thing as time. _Now, look: the\nFederation was a grand thing, potentially, if only, as Doc insists, it\nweren't for the damned cultural lag of the humanistic sciences, but\nthere is unfortunately no TIME to turn around and see if that little\nbrown cowlick is over her forehead the way it_----Meantime he said\naloud, \"Doc, Dorothy, get ready for a big one.\" And his hand pulled\nfor release--nicely, as you might steer a road car for a turn. The\npressure torment....\n\nFinished. He looked at a friendly green eye. So the retractile wings\nwere as good as eleven years ago--you hoped. Atmosphere--thin, said\nthe gauge. Never mind, thicker soon. _And down you go_----\n\n_Too steep. Level off, if there's stuff to bite on. There is.... Thank\nyou, Machine Age Man, for a sweet boat. That thing gibbering in the\nautonomic and voluntary nervous systems--merely fear. Overlook it...._\n\nThe ship was alien, far away. Turning, bright and deliberate, like a\nmirror dropped in a well. The other lifeboat? But Ed would have to\nreach it, close lock, strap in, open shield, while the ship went....\n\n\"Down\"--lately an artificiality, now the plainest word in the\nlanguage. A gleaming disturbance in the air \"down\" yonder--something\nstreaking away from the dot that was a dying ship? \"Ed, can you hear\nme? Over.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the voice in the earphones.\n\nPaul noticed himself weeping. \"They made it! They made it!\"\n\nThe voice said coldly, \"Quiet. Your altitude? Over.\"\n\n\"Forty-six thousand. All under control. Over, jerk.\"\n\n\"I'm going to head for----_Ah!_ Can you see the ship?\"\n\nIt was possible to find the silver dot of _Argo_ above an S-shaped\nexpanse of blue. The blue, Paul understood, was not becoming larger,\nsimply nearer. The dot changed to a white flower, which swelled and\nhung tranquilly over the blue, a brief memorial. The radio carried a\ngroan, and then: \"Better maybe. The lake may be shallow enough for\nsalvage. If it'd hit ground there'd be nothing at all. Get nearer,\nPaul. Keep me in sight--not too damn' near.\"\n\nTime.... Delicately Paul asked the boat for a steeper glide. The\nresponse was even. Was it? Some peevish sound. He flattened the glide\na thousand feet above Ed's boat. The red-green below--anything real\nabout it? Yes, if time was real, but one had to think that over....\n\nMild hills of dark red-green, in the--west? Yes, because now there was\na birth of sunset beyond them. Lighter green below, alongside the\nlake: that would be meadow. Not one of the great lakes--no larger\nthan Lake Champlain, its outlet in the south blurred by marsh; only a\nportion of its northwest shore adjoined the meadow--except in that\nregion the lake was a blue S written on red-green dark of jungle. A\nwinged brown thing slipped by, teasing the edge of vision. \"Bird or\nsomething....\"\n\nIn the earphones was a dazed note, like shame. \"Power was out of control,\nPaul--port motor. Had to be a defect in the building--something that\ncouldn't take the strain of what happened eleven years ago. All the\nway--God!--and then to be loused up by a builder's error!\" To Spearman,\nPaul knew, a mechanical defect was the gravest of indecencies, beyond any\nforgiveness.\n\nTrue sunset here. A world. And you don't climb out of gravity on\ncharlesite. Paul said, \"Doc--parallel lines--I think.\"\n\nBut the speed of the glide allowed no certainty, only a glimpse of\nthree dark bars, perhaps half a mile long in the jungle area northwest\nof the meadow, and a hint of other groups further north. They _should_\nbe there, according to a map Spearman had made in orbit from the final\nphotographs. And some fifty miles south of here was a great network of\nthem thirty miles long. The glide brought them out over meadow once\nmore.\n\nA thing was riding with them. A grumbling moan. Paul told himself:\n_With Model L-46 it cannot happen--it cannot--Dorothy--Doc_----\n\nDorothy cried, \"Specks--in the open ground. Moving, hundreds of 'em.\nOh, look! _Smoke_, Paul--campfires. How high are we?\"\n\n\"Under seven thousand. Check your compass by the sunset, Doc. See if\nwe have a magnetic north.\"\n\n\"We do....\"\n\nSpearman's far-off voice said, \"Life all right. I can't make out----\"\n\nPaul cut in with hurried precision: \"Ed--vibration, port wing, bad.\nI'm going to make one more circle over the woods if I can and try for\nthe north end of this meadow.\"\n\nA startled croak: \"I'll jet off--give you room.\" Paul saw the squirt\nof green flame. Ed's boat darted westward like a squeezed apple seed.\nPaul dipped and leveled off as much as he dared. \"We're--all right.\"\n\nHe lived with it a timeless time. Knowing it would happen. They were\ncircling over jungle, pointed into sunset. The jet would only make\nmatters worse--rip the heart out. Soon the meadow would come around\nagain....\n\nBut the moment was now. An end of the moaning vibration. A lurch.\nPaul's hand leaped stupidly for the charlesite ignition and checked\nitself.\n\nCalm, but for the reeling of sunset. _I must tell Dorothy not to fight\nthe straps: L-46 is solid--is solid----_\n\nThen the smash, the tearing and grinding. Somehow no death. Sky in the\nwindow changed to a gloom of purple and green. No death. Elastic\nbranches? Metal whimpered and shrieked. _Is that us?_ They built them\nsolid....\n\nThere was settling into silence. The pressure on Paul's cheek, he\nknew, was the wonderfully living pressure of Dorothy's hand, because\nit moved, it pinched his ear, it groped for his mouth. A hiss. Through\nthe wrenched seams the old air of Earth yielded to the stronger weight\nof Lucifer's. The starboard wing parted with a squeal like amusement,\nletting the boat's body rest evenly on the ground, and Christopher\nWright said, \"Amen.\"\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nThe Earphones Were Squawking: \"Speak Up! Can you hear me? Can you----\"\n\n\"Not hurt. Seams open, and there goes Sears' thirty-six-hour test for\nair-borne bacteria. Down and safe, Ed.\"\n\n\"Listen.\" In relief, Ed Spearman was heavily didactic again. \"You are\nthree quarters of a mile inside the jungle. I will land near the\nwoods. It will be dark in about an hour. Wait there until we----\"\n\n\"One minute,\" Paul said in sudden exhaustion. \"We can find you,\neasier. Sears' test is important. We're already exposed to the air,\nbut----\"\n\n\"What? Can't hear--damn it----\" The voice dimmed and crackled.\n\n\"Stay sealed up!\" Nothing. \"Can you hear?\" Nothing. \"Oh, well, good,\"\nsaid Paul, discarding the headset, adding foolishly: \"I'm tired.\"\n\nDorothy unfastened his straps; her kiss was warm and quick.\n\n\"Radio kaput, huh?\" Wright flexed lean cautious legs. \"Pity. I did\nwant to tell Sears one I just remembered after eleven years, about\npoor lackadaisical Lou, who painted her torso bright blue, not for\nlove, not for money, not because it looked funny, but simply for\nsomething to do.\"\n\n\"You're not hurt, Doc,\" Dorothy said. \"Not where it counts.\"\n\n\"Can't kill an anthropologist. Ask my student Paul Mason. Leather\nhides, pickled in a solution ten parts curiosity to one of statistics.\nDoctors are mighty viable too. Ask my student Dorothy Leeds.\"\n\nPaul's forehead was wet. \"Dark in an hour, he reminded me.\"\n\n\"How close are we to the nearest of those parallel lines?\"\n\n\"Three or four miles, Doc, at a loose guess.\"\n\n\"Remember that great mess of 'em fifty or sixty miles south of here?\nShows on Ed's map. We must be--mm--seventy miles from the smallest of\nthe two oceans--oh, let's call it the Atlantic, huh? And the other one\nthe East Atlantic? Anyway the ocean's beyond that range of hills we\nsaw on the way down.\"\n\n\"I saw campfires in the meadow,\" Dorothy said. \"Things running.\"\n\n\"I thought so too.... Paul, I wonder if Sears can do any testing of\nthe air from the lifeboat? Some of the equipment couldn't be\ntransferred from _Argo_. And--how could they communicate with us?\nThey'll have to breathe it soon in any case.\"\n\nPaul checked a shuddering yawn. \"I must have been thinking in terms of\n_Argo_, which is--history.... You know, I believe the artificial\ngravity was stronger than we thought? I feel light, not heavy.\"\n\n\"High oxygen?\" Dorothy suggested. \"Hot, too.\"\n\n\"Eighty-plus. Crash suits can't do us any more good.\" They struggled\nout of them in the cramped space, down to faded jackets and shorts.\n\nWright brooded on it, pinching his throat. \"Only advantage in the\nothers' staying sealed up a while is that if we get sick, they'll get\nsick a bit later. Could be some advantage. Paul--think we should try\nto reach them this evening?\"\n\n\"Three quarters of a mile, dark coming on--no. But so far as I'm\nconcerned, Doc, you're boss of this expedition. In the ship, Ed had to\nbe--matter of engineering knowledge. No longer applies. I wanted to\nsay that.\"\n\nWright turned away. \"Dorothy?\"\n\nShe said warmly, \"Yes. You.\"\n\n\"I--oh, my dear, I don't know that it's--best.\" Fretfully he added:\n\"Shouldn't need a leader. Only six of us--agreement----\"\n\nDorothy held her voice to lightness: \"I can even disagree with myself.\nSears will want you to take over. Ann too, probably.\"\n\nHis gray head sank in his hands. \"As for that,\" he said, \"inside of me\nI'm apt to be a committee of fifteen.\" Paul thought: _But he's not\nold! Fifty-two. When did he turn gray, and we never noticing it...?_\n\"For now,\" Wright said, \"let's not be official about it, huh? What if\nmy dreams for Lucifer are--not shared?\"\n\n\"Dreams are never quite shared,\" Dorothy said. \"I want you to lead\nus.\"\n\nWright whispered with difficulty, \"I will try.\"\n\nDorothy continued: \"Ed may want things black and white. Not Ann, I\nthink--she hates discussions, being obliged to make up her mind.\nYou're elected, soldier.... Can you open the door, Paul?\"\n\nIt jammed in the spoiled frame after opening enough for a tight exit.\nWright stared into evening. \"Not the leader kind. Academic.\" His white\nhands moved in doubtful protest. \"Hate snap decisions--we'll be forced\nto make a lot of them.\"\n\nPaul said, \"They're best made by one who hates making them.\"\n\nThe lean face became gentle. \"Taught you that myself, didn't I,\nson...? Well--inventory. What've we got, right here?\"\n\n\"Thirty days' rations for three, packed eleven years ago. Two\nautomatic rifles, one shotgun, three automatic pistols, three hundred\nrounds for each weapon. Should have transferred more from the ship,\nbut--we didn't. Three four-inch hunting knives, very good----\"\n\n\"They at least won't give out. With care.\"\n\n\"Right. Two sealed cases of garden seeds--anybody's guess about them.\nSix sets of overalls, shorts, and jackets. Three pairs of shoes\napiece--the Federation allowed that you and Ann might grow a little,\nDot--plasta soles and uppers, should last several years. Carpentry\ntools. Ed's boat has the garden tools instead. Sears did pack his\nmicroscope, didn't he?\"\n\n\"Oh my, yes,\" said Dorothy, in affectionate mimicry of the fat man's\nturn of speech.\n\n\"Each crash suit has first-aid kit, radion flashlight (good for two\nyears maybe), compass, field glasses, plus whatever else we had sense\nenough to stuff in. Set of technical manuals, mostly useless without\nthe ship, but I think there's one on woodcraft, primitive tools and\nweapons--survival stuff----\"\n\n\"Oh, the books!\" Wright clutched his hair, groaning. \"The books----\"\n\n\"Just that woodcraft----\"\n\n\"No, no, no--the books on _Argo_! Everything--the library--I've only\njust understood that it's gone. The whole flowering of human\nthought--man's best, uncorrupted--_Odyssey_--Ann's music, the art\nvolumes you selected, Paul, and your own sketches and paintings----\"\n\n\"No loss there----\"\n\n\"Don't talk like a damn fool! Shakespeare--_Divina commedia_----\"\n\nDorothy twisted in the narrowness to put both arms around him.\n\"Doc--quiet, dear--please----\"\n\n\"I can remember pages of _Huck Finn_--_a few pages_!\"\n\nDorothy was wiping his face with a loose comer of her jacket.\n\"Doc--subside! Please now--make it stop hurting inside yourself. Oh,\nquiet....\"\n\nAfter a time he said lifelessly, \"Go on with the inventory, Paul.\"\n\n\"Well--there's a duplicate of that map Ed made yesterday from orbit\nphotographs of this area, about a hundred miles square. We're near the\neastern edge of that square. There's the other map he made of the\nwhole globe. We didn't duplicate that one. I guess that's about it.\"\n\n\"Knives,\" Wright muttered. \"Knives and a few tools.\"\n\n\"The firearms may make a difference while they last.\"\n\n\"Yes, perhaps. But thirty years from now----\"\n\n\"Thirty years from now,\" said Dorothy, still sheltering his head,\n\"thirty years from now our children will be grown.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" Wright groped for her fingers. \"You almost wanted it like this,\ndidn't you? I mean, to land and not return?\"\n\n\"I don't know, Doc. Maybe. I'm not sure I ever quite believed in the\npossibility of return. State Orphanage children like Ann and me,\ngrowing up in a tiny world within a big one, we weren't quite human\never, were we? Not that the big world didn't seep in plenty.\" She\nsmiled off at private shadows of memory. \"We did learn things not in\nthe directors' curriculum. When they started grooming Ann and me for\nthis--Youth Volunteers! Stuffing our little heads with the best they\nhad--oh, it was fun too. By that time I think I had a fair idea of the\nbig world. The Orphanage was pleasant, you know--clean, humanitarian,\ngood teachers, all of them kind and more than a bit hurried. They did\ntry so hard never to let me hear the word 'nigger'! Ignorance is poor\ninsulating material, don't you think? And why, Doc, after all that's\nbeen known and thought and argued for the last hundred years, couldn't\nthey select at least one Oriental for our little trip? Wouldn't have\nhad to come from Jenga's empire--our own states in the Federation had\nplenty of 'em--scholars, technicians, anything you care to name.\"\n\nWright had calmed. He said, \"I argued for it and got told. They even\nsaid that the spaceport rights and privileges recently given to\nJenga's empire would allow the Asiatics to build their own\nship--tacitly implying that humanity should stay in two camps world\nwithout end. Ach! You can shove the political mind just so far, then\nit stalls in its own dirt Even Jensen wasn't able to budge them.\"\n\n\"It's history,\" said Dorothy, and Paul wondered: _How does she do it?\nSpeaking hands and voice, enough to shove away the black sorrow even\nbefore it fairly had hold of him--and she'd try to do it for anyone,\nloved or not. She was the first (and only one) who said to me there\nare some things more important than love-and she herself would be\nbothered to explain that in words._ \"Well,\" Dorothy reflected, \"I\nbelieve the Orphanage slapped too much destiny of Man on the backs of\nour little necks--they're just necks. Paul, why don't you sleep\nawhile? You too, Doc. Let me keep watch. I'll wake you both if\nanything stirs out there. Doze off, boys.\"\n\nPaul tried to, his mind restless in weary flesh. No permissible margin\nof error, said the twenty-first century. But _Argo_ lay at the bottom\nof a lake because of an error. Not an error like the gross errors\ntwenty-first century man still made in dealing with his own kind and\nstill noisily disregarded, but an engineering error--something\ntwenty-first-century man viewed with a horror once reserved, in not so\nancient times, for moral evil. The cardinal sin was to drop a decimal.\nIf, like Wright, or Paul himself, you were concerned with the agony\nand growing pains of human nature, disturbed by the paralytic\nsterility of state socialism and the worse paralysis of open tyranny,\nyou kept your mouth shut--or even yielded, almost unknowingly, to the\npressures that reduced ethical realities to a piddling checker game\nperverting the uses of semantics. They said, \"There won't be any war.\nIf there is, look what we've got!\" If you were like the majority of\nEarth's three billion, you hoped to get by with as much as the traffic\nwould bear and never stuck your neck out. They celebrated the turn of\nthe third millennium with a jolly new song: \"Snuggle up, Baby--Uncle\npays the bill....\" But for all that, you mustn't use the wrong bolt.\n\nUnreasonably quiet here. A jungle evening on Earth would have been\nriotous with bird and insect noises.... He slept.\n\nIt was dark when Wright's finger prodded him. \"A visitor.\"\n\nThe darkness was rose-tinged, not with sunset. There were two moons,\nPaul remembered, one white and large and far away, one red and near.\nShould the red moon be shining now? He gazed through the half-open\ndoorway, wondering why he was not afraid, seeing something pale and\nvast, washed in--yes, surely in reddish moon-light. A thing swaying on\nthe pillars of its legs, perhaps listening, tasting the air for\nstrangeness. And scattered through the night, sapphires on black\nvelvet, were tiny dots of blue, moving, vanishing, reappearing. \"Blue\nfireflies,\" Dorothy whispered, \"blue fireflies, that's all they are.\"\nHe felt her controlled breathing, forced down a foolish laugh. _We\ncould have done without a white elephant._\n\nNine or ten feet tall at the shoulder, a tapir-like snout, black tusks\nbending more nearly downward than an elephant's, from milk-white\nflesh. The ears were mobile, waving to study the night. There was an\noval hump near the base of the neck. The beast had been facing them;\nit turned to pull down a branch, munch the leaves, casually drop the\nstalk. In silence it drifted away, pausing to meditate, grumbling\njuicily, but with no alarm.\n\nWright whispered, \"The planet Lucifer did not ask for us.\"\n\n\"Paul--I stepped out for a minute, while you were both asleep. Firm\nground. A smell--flowers, I think--made me remember frangipani.\"\n\n\"I'll try it.\"\n\n\"Oh, but not with that thing----\"\n\n\"He didn't seem to mind us. I'll stay near the door.\" He knew Dorothy\nwould come with him. Feeling earth under legs that had nearly\nforgotten it, he turned to help her down; her dark eyes played diamond\ngames with the moon-light.\n\nIt could have been a night anywhere in the Galaxy, up there beyond\ntorn branches, stars, and red moon in a vagueness of cloud. Blue\nfireflies....\n\nBut there was a child wailing somewhere. Far-off and weak, a dim rise\nand fall of sound, grief and remoteness. A waterfall? Wind in upper\nbranches? But they were still, and the sound carried the timbre of\nanimal life. Dorothy murmured, \"It's been crying that way ever since\nmoon-rise.\" She came closely into his arms.\n\n\"I can read one thing inside of you--you're not scared.\"\n\n\"I'm not, Paul?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"But don't ever leave me--Adam.\"\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nThis was dawn: vision out of the dark: ripples of music coalescent in\none forest voice moving toward a crescendo of daytime.\n\nPaul watched a spreading of color in the leaves, a shift from black to\ngray to a loveliness more green than red; the trees were massively\nold, with varied bark of green or purple-brown. Phantoms in the more\ndistant shadows could be understood now that light was advancing: they\nwere thick trees with a white bark like that of the never-forgotten\nbirches of New Hampshire. Underfoot Paul felt a humus that might have\nbeen a thousand years in growing; he prodded it with his knife--a\nwhite worm curled in mimic death.\n\nEverywhere purple-leaved vines, vastly proliferating, climbed in a\nriot of greed for the sunlight of the forest ceiling. Paul sensed a\nmute cruelty in them, a shoving lust of growth. It might have been\nthese, elastically yielding, that had saved the lifeboat from total\nruin.\n\nOvernight the gravity of Lucifer had become natural. His close-knit\nbody accepted and relished it, finding a new pleasure in strength:\nthirty-seven years old and very young.\n\nOne tiny voice was near, persistent. Paul walked around the boat,\nwhere Dorothy and Wright still slept. The starboard wing, parting from\nthe lifeboat, had gashed a tree trunk, littering the ground with\nbranches. The source of the voice was a brown lump, twenty feet up,\nclinging head downward, a body small as a sparrow's, wings folded like\na bat's. As he watched they spread, quivered, and relaxed. Head and\nears were mousy, the neck long, with a hump at its base. The throat\npulsed at each cry. Near Paul's foot lay a fabric like an oriole's\nnest, fastened to a twig that had been torn from the tree. Three\nyoung had tumbled out. One was not mangled but all were dead,\nhairless, poignantly ugly. \"Sorry, baby--our first act on Lucifer.\"\nThe parent creature made another abortive motion as Paul took up the\nyoung.\n\nIts high lament was not what he and Dorothy had heard in the night.\nThat had been continuing when he slipped out to watch for dawn, and it\nhad ended at some unnoticed moment--profoundly different, surely far\noff....\n\nHe tried to study the dead things as Sears Oliphant would want to do.\nTwo were hopelessly torn; he dug a hole in the humus and dropped those\nin, smoothing the surface, wondering at his need for an act which\ncould mean nothing to the unhappy morsel of perception on the tree\ntrunk. The third, and the nest, he carried around the boat where the\nlight was better.\n\nAll seven digits of the forelimb spread into a membranous wing; the\nhind leg divided at the ankle, three toes anchoring the wing, the\nother four fused into a slim foot which had suction pads. He cradled\nthe bit of mortality in his palm, recalling a thing Wright had said\nwhen they entered the lifeboat. Captain Jensen, waiting for take-off\nat the spaceport, trying, as he drank sherry with Christopher Wright,\nto look at the venture under the aspect of eternity, had said he liked\nthe philosophical implications of _Argo's_ converter, into which his\nown body was strangely soon to pass. What was Wright's comment eleven\nyears later? \"All life is cannibalism, benign or not: we are still\neating the dinosaurs.\" There had been more, which Paul could not\nremember. So, man drove eleven years through space and killed three\nbabies. _But there was no element of malevolence_....\n\nPerhaps there was none in most of man's actions over the millennia.\n\nWright crawled out, stiff-limbed and unrested.\n\n\"'Morning, Doc. Let me introduce _Enigma Luciferensis_.\"\n\n\"'Luciferensis' won't do.\" Wright peered down. \"Everything is\n'Luciferensis,' including the posterity Dot mentioned. Well now,\nwhat----\"\n\n\"A nestling. Our crash broke the nest and killed the young.\"\n\nWright fingered the fabric. \"Beautiful. Leaves gummed together with\nsome secretion.\" With a doctor's intentness he added: \"How d'you\nfeel?\"\n\n\"Good.\"\n\nA shadow circled Paul, settled on his arm, hobbling toward his palm\nand what it held. He felt the suction cups; with a careful mouth the\ncreature took up its dead and flew away. \"I've been remembering\nsomething you said: life eating life--without too much concern for the\nsecond law of thermodynamics. Forgive us our trespasses.... Good\nmorning, lady.\"\n\n\"What did I miss?\" Dorothy had glimpsed the departure.\n\n\"Lucifer's idea of a bat. I think that big flying thing I saw from the\nlifeboat was shaped like this midget. Haven't seen any birds.\"\n\nDorothy hugged his arm. \"Not even one measly robin?\"\n\n\"Sorry, Whifflepuff--fresh out of robins.\"\n\nWright blinked at his compass. \"Meadow that way.\" Paul was\ninattentive, needing the warm quiet of the woman beside him. Wright\nadded: \"First, breakfast.\" He broke the seal of a ration package and\nsnarled. \"Thirty days, I b'lieve you said. Antique garbage--dehydrated\nhay.\"\n\nDorothy said, \"You're nicest when you're mad, Doc. We'll soon have to\ntry the local stuff, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh. But no guinea-pig work for you or Ann.\"\n\nShe was startled. \"Why not? I can digest boilerplate.\"\n\n\"Two women on Lucifer: valuable livestock.\" Wright smiled with his\nmouth full. \"I'm boss, remember? For guinea-pig work, the men draw\nlots.\"\n\nShe was grave. \"I won't argue. It so happens----\" She peeked into the\nnest. \"Poor little fuzzies lined it with fur. Their own, I'll bet.\"\n\n\"It so happens what, dear?\"\n\n\"Ah.... This eleven-year-old gookum claims to be coffee. Can we make a\nfire? Looks like dead wood over there.\"\n\nThe branches burned aromatically; the morning was growing into deep\nwarmth, but still with freshness. Wright said, \"Coffee my shirt.\"\n\nDorothy tasted it. \"Brr...! I was about to say when I interrupted\nmyself, it so happens I'm six or seven weeks pregnant, I think.\"\n\n\"Six----\" Wright set his aluminum cup carefully upside down. Paul\nmumbled, \"That's what's been on your mind.\"\n\nBehind her eyes he glimpsed the primitive thing, deeper than thought,\nnot like a part of her but a force that sustained her, himself, all\nothers: the three billion of Earth, the small grieving spirit now\nflown away into the trees. \"Yes, Adam. I would have told you sooner,\nbut we all had a lot on our minds.\"\n\n\"Even before we got in orbit, you saw us settling--staying----\"\n\nDorothy grinned then. \"No-o, Paul. I just wanted the baby. Could have\nbeen born on the ship. The Federation said no, but....\"\n\nGradually Paul began to realize it. \"But you said yes.\"\n\nShe leaned to him, no longer smiling. \"I said yes....\"\n\nThe forest floor hushed footsteps; some coolness lingered. Paul walked\nin front, then Dorothy, and Wright marked blazes on the tree trunks.\nPaul glanced backward often, to capture the receding patterns. At the\nthird such pause the lifeboat was no longer visible--only a sameness\nof trees and sparse young life groping through shadow for the food of\nthe sun. In this depth of forest there was no brush; the going was\neasy except for the nuisance of purple vines that sometimes looped\nfrom tree to tree. Paul searched for any change of light ahead.\n\nThe boat held all but what they wore, the two rifles, the three\npistols holstered at their hips, the three knives, three sealed ration\npackages. Damage had prevented locking the door of the boat: to rob,\nan inhabitant of Lucifer would need only intelligence enough to solve\nthe sliding mechanism. They had seen no life but that huge nocturnal\nleaf eater, the small fliers, a white worm, and now a few timid\nten-legged scuttlers on the warm ground and midge-like specks dancing\nin shafts of sunlight. Too quietly, Wright said, \"Stop.\"\n\nPaul raised his rifle as he turned. Only untroubled forest. Wright's\nwarning hand lowered. \"Almost saw it. Heard nothing, just felt\na--watching. Might be in my head. Let's go on. And don't hurry.\"\n\nIt would have been possible to hurry, even with an eye on the compass.\nIt would have been possible, Paul thought, to run in panic, fall\nwhimpering and waiting. But you wouldn't do it....\n\nNo shape in this dim region could be right or wrong; the trees\nthemselves were no sweetly familiar beech or pine. They halted at\nsight of a new sprawling type of vine, uprooted where a break in the\nforest ceiling admitted more sunshine. The earth displayed hoof-prints\nlike a pig's. Some scattered tuberous roots were marked by teeth;\nDorothy sniffed one. \"Spud with garlic for a papa.\" Paul pocketed a\nsample. She said, \"Not that Lucifer cares, Doc, but what time is it?\"\n\n\"My watch says we've been walking fifteen minutes. Take it slow.\"\nWright presently added: \"I've had another glimpse. Not a good one.\nFurry, gray and white--white face, splashes of white on a gray body\nseven or eight feet tall. Human shape. We may be all right if we don't\nbother him.\"\n\n\"Or blunder into territory where he doesn't want us.\"\n\n\"There is that, Paul.\"\n\n\"Human shape,\" said Dorothy evenly. \"How human?\"\n\n\"Very. Upright. Good-sized head.... Ah--hear that?\" It was Ann's\nvoice, calling, from someplace where there should be sunlight. \"Don't\nanswer just yet--no sudden noises.\"\n\nClose to Paul, Dorothy whispered, \"The baby--I don't want to tell the\nothers quite yet.\"\n\nThat made it real--so real that in spite of a patch of beckoning blue\nPaul had to turn to her.\n\nBehind Wright, he saw it, among the pillars of the trees, retreating\nin fluid slowness till it was only a black ear, part of a white-furred\ncheek, an iridescent green eye showing, like a cat's, no white. But\nthe blue was also real....\n\nThe edge of the forest was a mass of young growth fighting for the\ngold coin of sunlight. \"Shield your faces\"--Wright was panting--\"could\nbe poisonous leaves.\" They broke through to a red-green field, the\nslim silver of the undamaged boat, the certainty of friends, an\nexpanse of lake no longer blue but sickly white. The boat's nose was\nthrust under an overhang of branches. Ann Bryan was unsteady and wan,\nbut there was welcome in her gray eyes for Dorothy, who joined her at\nonce and whispered with her. Sears' fat affectionate face carried a\ndetermined smile. Ed Spearman came forward, alert and commanding.\nWright asked, \"How long have you been out in the air?\"\n\n\"An hour.\" Ed was impatient. \"Sealed overnight. Nothing in the boat\nfor a test of the air, no point in waiting. You----\"\n\n\"Okay.\" Wright watched brown wings over the lake. \"What are those?\"\n\n\"Birds or some damn thing. The white on the lake is dead fish. I\nsuppose the ship blew under water or the impact killed them. Our\nGeiger says the water isn't radioactive. We haven't gone into the\nmeadow--been waiting for you.\"\n\nIn the south the meadow reached the horizon--twenty miles of it, Paul\nremembered from the air view, before jungle again took over. Near by,\nthreads of smoke were rising straight from the grass. \"Abandoned\nfires? We scared off----\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" Spearman said. \"Seen no life except those birds.\"\n\n\"Bat wings,\" Sears Oliphant remarked. \"Mammalian, I think--oh my, yes.\nCan't have furry birds, you know, with a taxonomist in the family,\nhey?\"\n\nSpearman shrugged. \"Must get organized. How much damage, Paul?\"\n\n\"The boat itself. Both wings off, radio dead. Couldn't lock the\ndoor....\" It was like an Earth landscape. Tall grass carried oatlike\nruddy seed clusters on green stems. The lake was bordered by white\nsand except close by, where jungle reached into water. There was\ncasual buzzing traffic above the grass, reminiscent of bees, wasps,\nflies. Far up, something drifted on motionless wings, circling. And\nten or fifteen miles to the west there was the calm of hills--rounded,\nold, more green than blue in a sleepy haze, but to paint them, Paul\nthought, you would shade off into the purple. Paul went on, absently:\n\"We'll have the charlesite of the wrecked boat of course. That gives\nthis one a theoretical twenty hours of jet. We have ammunition for\nlong enough to learn how to use bow and arrow, I think.\"\n\nAnn muttered, \"Paul, don't----\"\n\n\"What?\" Spearman was disgusted. \"Oh, you could be right at that, Paul.\nHard to realize.... Well, we must make some kind of camp.\"\n\nWright began: \"Some knowledge of the life around us----\"\n\n\"Oh my, yes----\"\n\n\"We'll have to make a camp before we can do any exploring, Doc. Here,\nout in the open. See anything in the woods?\"\n\n\"Something followed. More or less human----\"\n\n\"So we know the camp has to be in the open.\"\n\n\"Do we, Ed?\" Wright watched the distant bat wings. Spearman stared.\n\"Can't chance a forest we don't know.\"\n\n\"Still, I mean to look things over a bit. Feel not so good, Ann?\"\n\n\"All right,\" she said, glancing from Wright to Spearman, silently\nbegging to know: _Who is leader?_ \"Slightly slap-happy, Doc.\"\n\n\"Mm, sure.\" Wright hitched his rifle. \"Going to look at that nearest\nsmoke. You come, Paul--or you, Ed. One of you should stay here.\"\n\nSpearman leaned against the lifeboat, still-faced. \"Paul can go if he\nwants to. I think it's a risk and a waste of time.\"\n\nPaul watched him a moment, frightened not by a man whom he had never\nquite been able to like, but by the withdrawal itself, the sense of a\nbarrier to communication. _We start with a division on this first\nmorning of the world...?_ Paul hugged his own rifle and followed\nWright into the long whisper of the grass.\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nMoist heat pressed down, but the air of the meadow was sweet. There\nwere marks of trampling as well as the swath the boat had cut--trails,\nplaces where something might have crouched. Under his breath Wright\nasked, \"Feel all right, Paul?\"\n\nTruth was more needed than a show of courage. \"Not perfect, Doc. Am I\nflushed? You are, a little.\"\n\n\"Yes. Trace of fever; may wear off. Here's something----\"\n\nThey had not come far. Two red bodies barely three feet tall sprawled\nnear each other face down in the grass. Paul noticed oval bulges\nbetween shoulder blades modified to accommodate them, the pathos of\nfingers--seven-fingered hands--holding earth in a final grasp. The\nmale wore a loincloth of black fabric and a quiver almost full of\narrows; the female had a grass skirt, and her hand was tight on a\nstone-headed spear longer than herself. A bow of carved wood lay some\ndistance away; one could see how the little man had crawled in his\nagony after the bow was lost. Wright turned them over gently--bald\nskulls, no trace of body hair on skin of a rich copper color exciting\nto a painter's vision, green eyes with no visible whites in human\nfaces heavily tattooed, wide-open eyes, accusing no one. The bodies\nwere in rigor, a shaft in the man's neck, the woman pierced by an\narrow in the side. Blood colored the grass, dry but eloquent.\n\n\"War too,\" said Wright, and pulled out the arrows, showing Paul the\nstone heads, the intricate carving of the wood, thin-whittled wooden\nvanes taking the place of feathers. \"Stone Age war....\"\n\nThe male pygmy was the smaller of the two, and softer, his shape not\nfeminine but rounded and smooth. Both seemed mature, so far as age\ncould be guessed at all. The woman was rugged, with a coarser skin and\nthe scar tissue of old wounds; her two pairs of breasts were scarcely\nmore prominent than the ridged muscles of her midget chest.\n\nWright mulled it over, kneading his wrinkled throat. \"Physical\nrefinements of evolution as far along as our own. Straight thigh and\nneck, perfect upright posture; there was no slouch or belly sag when\nthey were on their feet. Human jaw, big brain case. That furry giant I\nsaw in the woods had complete upright posture too. Oh, it's natural,\nPaul. You stick fins on an ocean vertebrate, turn him into a\nfour-legged land animal, give him a few hundred million years. Almost\nbound to free his front limbs if they've stayed unspecialized.\" In the\ngaunt face, sadness and pity struggled with a bitter sort of mirth.\n\"The brain gets large, boy, and away you go, to--ach--to the\nFederation versus the Asian Empire--Lincoln, Rembrandt, the state\npapers of Abraham Brown. And to you and Dorothy and the baby.\" Wright\nstood erect, brushing bony knees, calm again. \"I'm almost pleased to\nfind it this primitive. I don't think it can have gone further\nanywhere on the planet, or we'd have seen cities, farms, roads, in the\nphotographs. Unless----\"\n\n\"Unless what, Doctor?\"\n\n\"Oh--unless there might be forms with no Earth parallel. In the\nforests perhaps--even underground. Thought of that? But that's\nspeculations, and our little soldiers here are fact. They have a\ncivilization--arrows say so, tattooing, garments. Rigid,\ntradition-bound--or maybe not, depending on how much language they've\ndeveloped to tie 'emselves in knots with.\"\n\n\"Bow and arrow--why, suh, almost as advanced as not being afraid to\nend a sentence with a preposition.\"\n\n\"Hell with you. Twenty thousand years ago, or whenever it was we\nreached our present physique, if there'd been anything external to\nteach men how to behave like grown-ups----. Well, we had to sweat it\nout--tribal wars, bigger wars, venerated fears, errors, and\nstupidities. But maybe here----\"\n\n\"Are _we_ big enough?\"\n\nWright shut his eyes. His thin cheeks were too bright; there was a\ntremor in the rifle tip. \"Wish I knew, Paul. We have to try.\"\n\nEd Spearman yelled, \"Look out!\" A rifle banged, and a pistol.\n\nA brown darkness had come swooping from the lake. Others\nfollowed--mud-brown, squealing. They had banked at the noise of the\nshots to circle overhead. Paul fired; a near one tumbled, screeching,\nthrashing a narrow wolfish head on a long neck, black teeth snapping\nin the death throes--but even now it was trying to hobble forward and\nget at them. The others wheeled lower until Wright's rifle spoke, and\nSpearman's; there was the dry slap of Dorothy's automatic pistol.\n\"Back to the trees!\" The wounded thing on the ground set up a bubbling\nhowl.\n\nMore were coming, with weaving of pointed red-eyed heads on mobile\nnecks. Paul ran, Wright loping beside him, hearing the crash of their\nfriends' weapons. Something slammed Paul's shoulder, flopped against\nhis leg, tripping him. He tumbled over a shape furry and violent that\nsmelled of fish and carrion. He fought clear of it, sobbing in animal\nwrath, and reached the shelter of the trees and Dorothy's embrace.\nSweat blinded him. Wright was clutching him too, getting his jacket\noff.\n\n\"Flesh wound. The hind foot got you----\"\n\n\"I saw it.\" Ann Bryan choked. \"Saw it happen. Filthy claws----\"\n\nWright had a bottle of antiseptic. \"Son, you ain't going to like this.\nHang on to the lady.\" But the pain was a welcome flare. Paul's eyes\ncleared as Wright made him a bandage of gauze, with Dorothy's help. He\ncould look from the shelter of overhanging branches at a confusion of\nwings. The creatures had not followed as far as the lifeboat; perhaps\nits shining mass disturbed them.\n\nSpearman groaned: \"You _would_ go out.\"\n\nWright snapped at him. \"Camp in the open--some disadvantages----\"\n\n\"Granted. But you sure learned it the hard way.\" \"Eating\"--Ann\npointed, nauseated--\"their own wounded--\"\n\nWright stepped between her and the loud orgy in the meadow. \"Wing\nspread, fifteen feet. Well--sky's bad, woods maybe. What do you\nsuggest?\"\n\n\"Clear underbrush,\" Spearman said, \"so we can see into the woods. Pile\nit just beyond this overhang of branches for a barrier, leave a space\nso we can reach the lifeboat. We can get to the lake for water without\ngoing much in the open.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Wright. A peace offering. Spearman smiled neutrally.\n\n\"If the water's safe,\" said Sears Oliphant.\n\nWright grinned at the fat man. \"Pal, it better be.\"\n\n\"Miracles?\" Sears' shoulders shot up amiably. \"We can hope it is, with\nboiling. Gotta have it. Canteens won't last the day, in this heat.\"\n\nPaul helped Ed unpack tools from the lifeboat. \"One sickle,\" Spearman\nnoted. \"No scythe. Garden gadgets. Pruning shears. One ax, one damned\nhatchet. No scythe, no scythe----. There were two or three on the\nship.\"\n\n\"Maybe the lake's not so deep.\"\n\n\"Maybe we'll play hell trying to find out too. Those things weren't\nmuch scared by the shooting....\"\n\nHot, tedious work created a circle of clear shaded ground which must\nbe called home. A fire was boiling lake water in the few aluminum\nvessels. It had a fishy, mud-bottom taste and could not be cooled, but\nit eased thirst. Paul had glimpsed Ann in the lifeboat, opening her\nviolin case, closing it, sick-faced. He had marveled again at the\nmystery of a Federation governing two-thirds of a world, which had\ngenially allowed a fourteen-year-old musician to carry her violin on\nman's greatest venture--with enough strings to last two or three years\nand no means of restringing the bow. Later Ann threw herself into the\nlabor of clearing brush but tired quickly from her own violence.\nSears' microscope occupied a camp table; Paul and Dorothy joined him\nin a pause for rest. \"Got anything for the local news-paper?\"\n\n\"Unboiled lake water-assorted wrigglers.\" Sears mopped his cheeks.\n\"'Twas never meant my name should be Linnaeus. Have a look.\" The world\non the slide seemed not unlike what Sears had once shown him in water\nfrom the hydroponics room of _Argo_: protoplasmic abundance no mind\ncould grasp. \"So far, nothing basically different from what you'd find\nin lake water on Earth--except for the trifle that every species is\nunknown, hey? I suppose that's why they heaved a taxonomist into\nspace, to see what the poor cluck would do, hey? Now, those red dots\nare something like algae. Notice a big ciliated schlemihl blundering\naround? He could almost be old man paramecium, oh my, yes. Gi'me your\nsickle, muscle man.\"\n\n\"Hot work, Jocko. Take it slow and easy.\"\n\n\"Believe me, Mistuh Mason, I will. What----\"\n\nIn undergrowth beyond the clearing there was deep-throated fury, a\ncrashing of branches. A gray and white man shape staggered out of\nconcealment, wrenching at what looked like swollen black rope. But the\nrope had a head, gripping the giant's forearm; a black loop circled\nthe giant's loins and his free arm, tearing and pounding, could not\nloosen it. A saurian hind leg groped, hooking for purchase into gray\nfur.\n\nPaul's hunting knife was out; there was time only for recognition. The\ngray and white being was everything human caught in a coil. Paul\nforced himself through a barrier of fear, hearing Wright yell, \"Don't\nshoot, Ed! Put that away.\" There was no shot. Paul knew he was between\nSpearman and the confusion of combat; someone was blundering behind\nhim. A black reptilian tail stretched into bushes, grasping something\nfor anchorage. Paul slashed at that. The mass of heaving life rolled\non the ground as the giant lost his footing, serpent teeth still\nburied in his forearm. Green eyes were pleading in a universal\nlanguage.\n\nWright was clutching a black neck, with no strength to move it, and\nPaul stabbed at scaled hide behind a triangular head, but the skin was\nlike metal. The forelimbs were degenerate vestiges, the hind legs\ncruelly functional. At last the steel penetrated; Paul twisted it,\nprobing for a brain. The giant had ceased struggling; the furred face\nwas close. Paul could feel the difficult breath, sense a rigid\nwaiting.... The teeth let go. The giant leaped free, returning at once\nwith a stone the size of Paul's chest, to fling it down on the\nslow-dying body, repeating the action till his enemy was a smear of\nblack and red.\n\nNow in returning quiet a furred man eight feet tall watched them\nopenly. Wright said, \"Ed, put away that gun. This man is a friend.\"\n\n\"Man!\" Spearman holstered his automatic, ready for a draw. \"Your\ndaydreams will kill us all yet.\"\n\n\"Smile, all of you--maybe his mouth does the same thing.\" Wright\nstepped to the trembling monster, hands open. Ann was sobbing in\nreaction, smothering the sound. Wright pointed at himself. \"Man.\" He\ntouched the gray fur. \"Man....\"\n\nThe giant drew back, not with violence. Paul felt Dorothy's small\nfingers shivering on his arm. The giant sucked his wound and spat,\nturning his head away from Wright to do it. \"Man--man....\" Wright's\nhand, small and pale as an oyster shell, spread beside the huge palm,\nsix fingers, long four-jointed thumb. \"Paul--your first-aid kit. I\nwant just the gauze.\"\n\nSpearman said, \"Are you crazy?\"\n\n\"It's a chance,\" Sears Oliphant said in a level, careful voice. \"Doc\nknows what he's doing. Ed, you should know you can't stop him.\"\n\nWright was pointing to Paul's bandaged shoulder and to the giant's\nwound. The high furred forehead puckered in obvious effort. Dorothy\nwas choking on a word or two: \"Doc--must you--\"\n\n\"He knows we're friends. He's been watching a long time. He saw Paul\nget hurt and then bandaged.\" The giant's trembling was only a\nspasmodic shuddering. \"Man--man....\" Wright snipped off gauze. \"And he\nknows that thing is a weapon, Ed. Will you put it away?\"\n\n\"He could break you in two. You know that, don't you?\"\n\n\"But he won't. Give protoplasm a chance.\" Now Wright was winding gauze\nlightly, firmly, hiding the already clotting blood, and the giant made\nno move of rejection. \"Man--man.\"\n\n\"Man.\" The giant murmured it cautiously, prolonging the vowel; he\ntouched his chest. \"_Essa kana._\" A finger ran exploringly over the\ngauze.\n\n\"Essa kana--man,\" said Wright, and swayed on his feet.\n\nThe giant pointed at the bloody mess on the ground and rumbled:\n\"_Kawan_.\" He shuddered, and his arm swept in a loose gesture that\nappeared to indicate the curving quarter mile where lake and jungle\nmet each other in a black-water marsh. Then he was staring out,\nmuttering, at the wings in the meadow, and presently he touched Paul's\nbandage with fantastic lightness. \"_Omasha_,\" he said, pointing at the\nflying beasts. He indicated the rifle wobbling in Sears' arm and held\nup two fingers. \"Omasha.\"\n\n\"Yes, we killed two omasha. Sears-man. Paul-man. Wright-man.\"\n\nThe giant rumpled his chest fur. \"Mijok.\"\n\n\"Mijok-man.... Mijok, why didn't I have you in Anthropology IA fifteen\nyears ago? We'd've cleaned up the joint.\" Mijok knew laughter; his\nbooming in response to Wright's tone and smile could mean nothing\nelse. But Wright staggered and was breathing hard. Dorothy whispered,\n\"Paul--\"\n\nIt could not be pushed aside any more--the pain separate from the\nsmart of his shoulder, tightness in the eyeballs, chill, nausea. \"The\nair--\"\n\nWright's knees buckled. Sears had dropped the rifle and was helping\nhim to the lifeboat, Paul watching the action in a daze of stupidity.\nWright's eyes had gone empty.... Paul was uncertain how he himself\ncame to be sitting on the ground. Dorothy's face was somewhere; he\ntouched it. Her brown cheek was fire-hot, and she was trying to speak.\n\"Paul--take care of you--always--\"\n\nThe face of Mijok was there too--red vapor turning black.\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nPaul Mason stared into blue calm: airy motion of branches against the\nsky, a mystery remembered from long ago, in a place called New\nHampshire. Those years were not dead: secretly the mind had brought\nthem here. _What a small journey! Less than five light-years: on a\nstar map you could hardly represent it with the shortest of lines...._\nHe was without pain, and cool. Time? Why, that amiable thud of a heart\nin a firm, familiar body (his own, surely?), that was indicating time.\nThe boy in New Hampshire, after sprawling on his lazy back and\ndiscovering the miracle of sky--hadn't he tried to paint it, even\nthen? Messed about with his uncle's palette, creating a daub that\nhad--oh, something, a little something. _Very well. Once upon a time\nthere was a painter named Paul Mason_.... Dorothy....\n\n\"You're back--oh, darling! No, Paul, don't sit up fast or your head'll\nhurt. Mine did.\" Now she was curling into the hollow of his arm,\nlaughing and weeping. \"You're back....\"\n\nA thin old man sat cross-legged on gray moss. Paul asked him, \"How\nlong?\"\n\nChristopher Wright smiled, twisting and teasing the skin of his gaunt\nthroat, gray with a thick beard stubble. \"A day and a night, the nurse\nsays. You know--the nurse? You were kissing her a moment ago. It's\nearly morning again, Paul. She was never quite unconscious, she\nclaims. I recovered an hour ago. No ill effects. It knocked out the\nothers at nightfall--predictable. They were exposed to Lucifer's air\nthirteen hours later than we were.\" Paul saw them now, lying on beds\nof the gray--moss? And where he and Dorothy clung to each other was\nthe same pleasant stuff--dry, spongy, with an odor like clover hay.\n\"Beds by courtesy of Mijok.\" Wright nodded toward the gray giant, who\nhad also brought moss for himself and now sprawled belly down,\nbreathing silently, the bulge between his shoulder blades lightly\nrising and falling. Mijok's face was on his arm, turned away toward\nthe purple shadow of forest.\n\nDorothy whispered, \"He watched over us all night.\"\n\n\"So you were conscious all the time? Tell me.\"\n\nDorothy kept her voice low. Paul noticed the towering slimness of the\nlifeboat beyond the barrier of branches, reversed--Ed Spearman's work,\nhe supposed. It pointed toward the west. Turned so, the jet would\nblast toward the lake, harming nothing. Its shadow held away the heat\nof the sun, a gleaming artifact of twenty-first century man, the one\nalien thing in this wilderness morning. The sickness, Dorothy said,\nhad taken her with a sudden paralysis: she could see, hear, be aware\nof boiling fever, but could not move. Then even the sense of heat left\nher--she was only observing eyes, ears, and a brain. She had had a\nfantasy that she was dead, no longer breathing. \"But I breathed.\" Her\nsmall brown face crinkled with a laughter rich in more than amusement.\n\"It's a habit I don't mean to abandon.\"\n\n\"Neurotoxin,\" said Wright, \"and a damn funny one. Back on Earth, when\nI believed myself to be a doctor, I never heard of anything like it.\"\n\nThe condition had lasted all day, she said; at nightfall her sense of\ntouch had gradually returned. She could move her hands, later her feet\nand head. At length she had sat up, briefly blinded by pain in the\nforehead, then she had given way to an overwhelming need for sleep. \"I\ngot a glimpse of you, Paul, and tumbled off into a set of dreams that\nwere--not so bad, not so bad. I woke before sunrise. Different. Don't\nask me how. Never felt healthier. Not even weak, as you should be\nafter a fever. But Doc--what if the illness--\"\n\nWright looked away from the terror that had crossed her face. \"If you\ngo on feeling all right, we can assume nothing's wrong with the baby.\nDon't borrow trouble, sugarpuss--we've got enough.\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" Paul suggested, \"the illness was just--oh, some of our Earth\nmetabolism getting burned out of us. A stiff acclimation course.\"\nWright grunted, pinching his long nose. Paul said, \"Wish it had burned\nout the yen for a cigarette that I've had for eleven years.\"\n\nSears Oliphant, the only other with some medical knowledge, had taken\ncharge immediately after their collapse. \"He is--scared, Paul,\"\nDorothy murmured. \"Of Lucifer, I mean. I could feel it when I was just\na pair of eyes and ears. More physical shrinking in him than in the\nrest of us, and he's fighting it back with all he's got. He's a very\nbig man, Paul....\" Sears looked peaceful enough now, in the dark sleep\nof the sickness, his moon face bristling with black beard growth but\nrelaxed and bland. On another couch of moss, Spearman was more\nrestless, powerful arms twitching as if he needed to fight the\ndisaster even in sleep. Ann Bryan was deeply flushed and moaned a\nlittle now and then. \"Ed was all right too. Considerate. Took all\nSears' orders without any fuss or question; I don't think he's much\nscared. He feels he can bull his way through anything, and maybe he's\nright.\" Dorothy's helpless eyes had also seen Mijok bringing moss in\ngreat armfuls. This, she thought, had helped Ed Spearman to accept the\ngiant as a man and perhaps as a friend. She remembered Mijok raising\nPaul and herself in one careful swing of his arms to set them down\nbeside each other on the moss. Later she had watched him turning the\nlifeboat under direction of Spearman's blunt gestures. Its length was\nthirty-four feet, its weight over three tons Earth gravity--more here.\nOne gray-white arm had lifted the tail and swung the boat on its\nlanding gear as a man might push a light automobile. \"I wasn't afraid.\nAfter dark, when I knew the sickness had got the others, I still\nwasn't afraid. Believe me? I could see Mijok moving around. Once I\nheard him growl--I think he was driving something off. And then while\nthe red moon was coming up, he sat by us--his eyes are red in the\ndark, Paul, not green. He smells musky at close range, but clean. I\nwasn't afraid. Now and then he'd look us over and smile with his funny\nblack lips and touch the furry back of his finger to our foreheads....\nI could see the blue fireflies, Paul. Someday you'll make up stories\nabout them for the baby.... I heard that crying again--much nearer\nthan when we heard it that first night by the other lifeboat. Like a\ngroup of children crying, if you can imagine that synchronized, almost\nmusical. Mijok growled and fretted when it began, but it came no\nnearer. It had stopped when I woke.\"\n\n\"Some of Earth's critters sounded human--panthers, owls, frogs--\"\n\n\"Ye-es. Just possibly something like tree frogs....\"\n\nWright said, \"Mijok brought us raw meat this morning before he went to\nsleep, something like a deer haunch. The fire bothers him--he\nevidently didn't go near it last night after the others collapsed.\"\n\n\"Ed tried to show him about fire,\" Dorothy said. \"I remember. Mijok\nwas scared, and Sears told Ed to let it wait.\"\n\n\"Meat was good too.\" Wright smirked. \"We got the fire going, and Mijok\ndid try some cooked and liked it. You and Dorothy can have some\ntomorrow if I don't turn purple.\"\n\n\"Not guinea-pig,\" said Dorothy. \"Just pig.\"\n\n\"Hungry?\" Wright tossed Paul a ration package.\n\n\"Gah!\" But he opened it. \"Learned any more of Mijok's words?\"\n\n\"No. He won't have many. Nouns, simple descriptives. Must have some\ncontinuing association with his own breed, or he'd have no words at\nall. A hunter--with only nature's weapons, I think. That haunch was\ntorn, not cut--some hoofed animal smaller than a pony, fresh-killed\nand well bled. He must have got it while Dorothy slept. It may have\nstrayed into the camp during the night. I think Mijok lives in the\nwoods, maybe not even a shelter or a permanent mate. Anthropology IA.\"\nsaid Wright, and bowed in mimic apology to the sleeping giant. \"Those\npygmies will be something else again--Neolithic. Wish I understood\nthat bulge between the shoulder blades. All the creatures we've seen\nhave it--even that damn black reptile, I believe, though things were\ntoo mixed up to be sure.\"\n\nMijok woke--all at once, like a cat. He stretched, extending his arms\ntwelve feet from wrist to wrist. He smiled down at Paul. He studied\nthe helpless ones, peering longest at Ann Bryan; the black-haired girl\nwas breathing harshly, fidgeting. Now and then her eyes flickered open\nand perhaps they saw. Softly as smoke Mijok stepped into the shadow of\nthe trees and listened. Wright remarked, \"Speaking of that reptile,\nwe should set up a monument to it. Nothing luckier could have happened\nthan that chance to lend Mijok a hand.\" His gray eyes fixed on Paul,\nlids lowered in a speculative smile. \"I'm not the only one who\nremembers, Paul, that you were the first to go to his help. He hasn't\nforgotten.... Dot, you're sure Ed understood that we have a friend\nthere?\"\n\n\"He seemed to, Doc. I watched them. They got along--practically\nbuddies.\"\n\nPaul saw the bandage was still on Mijok's arm, earth-stained and with\nfragments of gray moss, but not disarranged; the bandage on his own\nshoulder had been removed. The flying beast's attack had left only a\nheavy scratch, which looked clean; there was no pain, only an itching.\nThe meadow was empty of brown wings. The dead fish were gone from the\nlake. Perhaps other scavengers had been busy in the thirteen-hour\nnight. The water was an innocent blue, a luminous stillness under the\nsun.\n\nMijok stole out into the grass, gazing westward along the line where\nmeadow met jungle. Returning, he squatted by Wright and muttered,\n\"_Migan_.\" He spread a hand three feet above the ground; two fingers\ndrooped and indicated the motion of walking legs. Paul suggested:\n\"Pygmies?\"\n\n\"Could be.\" Mijok stared eloquently at Wright's rifle then crouched at\nthe barrier of branches, complaining in his throat. Taking up his own\nrifle, Paul joined him. Dorothy hurried to the lifeboat and came back\nwith field glasses for him and Wright and herself. In spite of the\ngreat planet's heavy pull, her body moved with even more light\neasiness than it had shown in the unreal years of _Argo_. With the\nglasses, vague motion a quarter mile away in the meadow leaped\nshockingly into precision.\n\nThe pygmies were not approaching but heading out from the edge of the\nforest, a group of nine, barely taller than the grass, bald red heads\nand shoulders in single file. The rearmost had a burden: seven others\ncarried bows, with quivers on the right hip. \"Left-handed,\" Paul\nobserved aloud. The leader was the tallest--a woman, with a long\nspear. All were sending anxious glances at the sky and toward the\nhuman shelter; their motions suggested a fear so deep it must be pain,\nyet something drew them out there in spite of it. The pygmy with the\nburden, a rolled-up hide, was also a woman. The leader was bald as\nthe others, slender, muscular, her head round, with prominent forehead\nand thin nose, tattooed cheeks. The bowmen had only simple loincloths,\nand belts for their arrow quivers. The women's knee-length grass\nskirts were like the Melanesian, but the leader's was dyed a brilliant\nblue. Her two little pairs of breasts were youthfully firm and\npointed. Dorothy murmured, \"American civilization would have gone mad\nabout those people.\"\n\n\"What a girl!\" Wright sighed. \"I mean Dorothy--the Dope.\"\n\n\"Even a dope can be jealous. Do you s'pose Mrs. Mijok has--Oh! Oh,\npoor darling! Not funny after all, gentlemen----\"\n\nThe pygmy leader had turned full face, as the nine paused at trampled\ngrass. She wore a necklace of shell. These had no glitter, but their\nyellow and blue made handsome splashes against the red of her skin.\nReason told Paul that she could see at most only dazzling spots where\nsunlight might be touching the glasses he had thrust through wilted\nleaves. It made no difference: she was staring directly into him,\nmaking her grief a part of his life. A still-faced grief, too profound\nfor any tears, if she knew of tears. The green cat eyes lowered; she\nstabbed her spear into the ground and lifted her arms, a giving,\nyielding motion. Her lips moved--in prayer, surely, since all but one\nof the men were bowed, performing ritual gestures toward whatever lay\non the ground. The one who did not bow never ceased to watch the sky.\nThe prayer was brief. The woman's left hand dropped meaningly, the\nhide was unrolled, and its bearer raised what the grass had hidden--no\nmore than a skull and a few bones, a broken spear, a muddy scrap that\nmight have been a grass skirt. The hide was folded gently over these;\nthe group went on.\n\n\"Dorothy--those things you saw running when we were circling down--I\nmissed 'em,\" Wright said. \"Poor eyesight, and seems to me the air was\nstill misty from _Argo's_ crash in the lake. They were going south,\naway from here? And they could have been--people like these?\"\n\n\"Yes. Hundreds or thousands of them. I suppose the crash of _Argo_\nmust have seemed like the heavens falling. The lifeboats too.\"\n\n\"I think we interrupted a war.\"\n\n\"These would be survivors? Live in this part of the jungle maybe?\nLooking for what's left after those--those flying beasts--\"\n\n\"It makes sense,\" Wright said. \"They're more afraid of the sky than of\nour setup over here. Maybe we're gods who came down to help them. If\nwe did help them. Look: they've found another.... Yes, now the\nprayer.... Wish Mijok wasn't so afraid of them. Inevitable. To them I\nsuppose he's an ugly wild animal. Different species, similar enough to\nbe shocked at the similarity. 'Tain't good.\"\n\n\"Do we try for a foot in both camps?\"\n\n\"Paul, I think I'll take a rain check on answering that.... Ach--if I\ncould go out there now--communicate--\"\n\n\"No!\" Dorothy gasped. \"Not while the others are still sick.\"\n\n\"You're right of course.\" Wright fretted at his beard stubble. \"I get\nsillier all the time. As Ed would tell me if he were up and around.\nIt's the high oxygen....\"\n\nThere were brown splashes in the sky. The pygmies saw the peril first\nand darted for the woods--an orderly flight however--the woman with\nthe hide in front, the blue-skirted woman next, then the bowmen. Three\nof the latter turned bravely and shot arrows that glittered and\nwhined. The brown beasts wheeled and flapped angrily upward, though\nthe buzzing arrows dropped far short of them. The pygmies gained the\ntrees; the omasha scouted the edge of the woods, squawking, three of\nthem drifting toward the lifeboat, weaving heads surveying the ground.\nPaul gave way to unfamiliar savage enjoyment. \"Do we, Doc?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Wright, and took aim himself.\n\nAll three were brought down, at a cost of four irreplaceable rifle\nbullets and two shots from Dorothy's automatic. Mijok bellowed with\nsatisfaction but recoiled as Wright dragged a dirty brown carcass into\nthe clearing. \"A dissection is in order.\" Mijok grumbled and fidgeted.\n\"Don't fret, Mijok.\" Wright pegged down the wings of the dead animal\nwith sharp sticks and drew an incision on the leathery belly with his\nhunting knife. \"Good head shot, Paul--this one's yours. We'll do a\nbrain job from one of the others, but I think we'll let that wait for\nSears--oh my, yes...! Doesn't weigh over thirty pounds. Hollow bones\nlike a bird's, very likely. Hope they'll keep.\"\n\n\"You hope,\" Dorothy sniffed. \"What do you do when I turn housewife and\ninstruct you to get that awful mess the hell off my nice clean floor?\"\n\n\"Dope! And you my best and only medical student.\" He worked at the\ncutting dubiously, inexpertly. \"Conventional mammalian setup, more or\nless. Small lungs, big stomach. Hah--two pairs of kidneys?\" He spread\nthe viscera out on the wing. \"Short intestine, also like a bird. And\nshe was preparing a blessed event multiplied by--count 'em--six.\"\n\n\"Too many,\" said Paul. \"Altogether too industrious.\"\n\n\"What I really want to know--Oh...?\" With the lungs removed, it could\nbe seen that the hump on the back was caused by a great enlargement of\nfour thoracic vertebrae, which swelled into the chest cavity as well\nas outward. Wright cut away spinal cartilage. \"Damn, I _wish_ Sears\nwas doing this. Well, it's neural tissue, nothing else--a big swelling\nof the spinal cord.\" He sliced at the ugly head, but the hermorrhage\nfrom a .30-caliber bullet confused the picture. \"The brain looks too\nsimple. Could that lump in the cord be the hind brain? I hereby leave\nthe theories to Sears. But, son, you might slit the stomach and see\nwhat the old lady had for breakfast.\"\n\nPaul's clumsy cut on the slippery stomach bag made it plain what the\nomasha had eaten--among other things, an almost complete\nseven-fingered hand. Dorothy choked and walked away, saying, \"I am\ngoing to be--\"\n\n\"Cheer up.\" Paul held her forehead. \"Never mind the clean floor--\"\n\n\"Go away. I mean stay very close. Sorry to be so physiological. Me a\nmedic student! Even blood bothers me.\"\n\n\"Never mind, sugar--\"\n\n\"Sugar yourself, and wash your paws. We smell.\"\n\nMijok was muttering in alarm. Wright had abandoned the dissection and\ngone out in the meadow, cautious but swift, to the spot where\nyesterday they had found the pygmy soldiers. He took up a small skull\nand arm bone, pathetically clean--perhaps there were insect scavengers\nthat followed after the omasha--and the discarded bow. But instead of\nbringing back these relics, Wright held them high over his head,\nfacing westward. Tall and gray in the heavy sun, he stepped twenty\npaces further toward the region where the pygmies had entered the\njungle; then he set the bones down in the grass and strode back to the\nshelter, fingers twitching, lips moving in his old habit of talking\nhalf to himself, half to the world. \"The omasha,\" he said, \"cracked\nthe enlarged vertebrae--favorite morsel maybe.\"\n\nMijok moaned, blinking and sighing. He stared long at the silent grace\nof the lifeboat, then at Christopher Wright. He too was talking to\nhimself. Abruptly, something gave way in him. He was kneeling before\nWright, bending forward, taking Wright's hands and pressing them\nagainst the gray-white fur of his face and his closed eyes. \"Oh, now,\"\nWright said, \"now, friend--\"\n\nPaul remarked, \"You're elected.\"\n\n\"I will not be a god.\"\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nMijok released the hands of his deity and sat back on his haunches,\nfoggy-eyed. Wright stroked the great furry head, troubled and amazed.\n\"It won't do,\" Wright said. \"We'll have no gods on this planet. Unless\nhuman nature can make itself a little godlike. And no final\nArmageddon--for that's within too, and always was. Well, he'll learn\nlanguage fast. As he does, the first thing he must discover is that\nwe're all one flesh.\" But Mijok was gazing up in adoration at the\nsound of the voice, trembling, not in fear, smiling when he saw Wright\nsmile. \"I believe he never had a god before--hadn't reached the stage\nof personalizing the forces of nature. They're just forces, and\nhimself a bundle of perception, not even realizing that he's more\nknowing and sensitive than other animals. Not arrogant yet, not\nsophisticated enough to be cruel, or mean, or even ambitious....\"\n\nDorothy pushed her fists into her cheeks, brown eyes upturned to study\nthe old man: a way she had, carrying Paul back eleven years to the day\nhe had come aboard the ship and seen her for the first time and loved\nthe woman who was, even then, manifest in the leggy, awkward child.\n\"Doc, why did you do that, out there in the meadow?\"\n\n\"Why, Dorothy, we must make contact with those pygmies too. They\nare--advanced. It'll be more difficult. They'll have traditions--maybe\nsome very ancient ones. But we must make contact.\"\n\n\"Mijok hates them though. If they come here--\"\n\nWright grinned. \"Temporary advantage of being little tin deities. I\nthink Mijok will do whatever we indicate--until we're able to teach\nhim independence.\"\n\nPaul said, \"Don't think for a minute I'm not with you. But Doc, with\nthe others helpless we're only three--\"\n\n\"Four.\"\n\n\"Yes, four. There's our own survival to think of. It's a big planet.\nSeems to me you're taking it on all at once.\"\n\nWright slouched, loose-limbed, at the barrier, where he could watch\nthe meadow, and Mijok stayed close to him. \"I think we must, Paul. If\nwe start right perhaps we can go on right. A mistake at this point\ncould go on burning for a thousand years.... Why do you think he broke\nout into worship when he did? Our superior achievements--lifeboat,\nguns, the rescue from that reptile? The fact that I wasn't afraid of a\npoor pygmy's bones? All that, sure, but something else. Ed would say I\nwas daydreaming--but I think Mijok's heart knows what his brain can't\nyet interpret. Sears would agree, I think--his own heart's bigger than\nLucifer. Mijok hasn't the least conscious idea why I invited those\npygmies to come and get their dead. Down deeper, in the part of him\nthat made him bring the moss and the meat and take care of us, I think\nhe knows very well.\"\n\n\"You're proposing,\" Dorothy said, \"to take a chance on love?\"\n\nWright was tranquil, watching the meadow. \"Whenever men put their\nchips on the other thing they always lost, didn't they? Repeatedly,\nfor twenty or thirty thousand years? Did they ever create anything\ngood except in a milieu of co-operation, friendship, forbearance? One\nof the oldest of commonplaces--the teachers all knew it.\nLao-tse--Buddha--or stated negatively: 'He who lives by the sword....'\nAnd so on. Good is not the mere absence of evil, but the most positive\nof human forces. The instruments of good are charity, patience,\ncourage, effort and self-knowledge, each unavailing without the\nothers; remember that. And that's all the basic ethics I know. The\nrest is detail, solution of immediate problems as they arise. Even on\nEarth the good tended to win out in the long run: at least it did\nuntil the mechanical toys got out of hand. Then there was a century of\nliving under a question mark. There was also the Collectivist Party.\nYes, as a prime example of a part of my own philosophy totally\nperverted, I give you the Collectivist Party.\" Wright was talking to\nhimself again, the bitterness of Earth's history goading him into\nsoft-spoken monotone, drawling and dark, on a planet nearly five\nlight-years distant from the ancient confusions. \"The Collectivist\nParty, which turns 'co-operation' into the same sort of word fetish\nthat 'democracy' was less than a hundred years ago--co-operation\n_without_ charity, without patience, without courage and always,\nalways, without self-knowledge.\"\n\nDorothy still watched him with sober upturned eyes. \"Ed told me once\nhis father was a pilot in the Collectivist Army during the Civil War.\"\n\n\"I know.\" Wright smiled at her in bashful half apology. \"Some of the\nold wounds still bleed too, I guess. I generally manage to keep my\npolitical mouth shut when he's listening, if I can. Not that Ed could\nbe accused of still fighting the war that ended before he was born....\nRelax: I think they're coming.\"\n\nPaul joined Wright and the giant at the barrier, but Dorothy stayed a\nmoment with the sick, feeling their wrists, murmuring something close\nto Ann's ear, although the girl could not respond. \"Past the fever\nstage, I believe,\" she said. \"They're all breathing well. No chance\nthey'll be out of it before night, I suppose....\"\n\nThe pygmies were still some distance away, slipping along the edge of\nthe woods in plain sight. There were only three--the two women and one\nbowman; perhaps the others were paralleling their course inside the\nforest--perhaps a hundred others were. Wright whispered, \"Have we\nanything that would make a respectable gift?\"\n\nMijok was rumbling in misery and fright. Dorothy came over holding a\nlocket. \"This--you remember, Doc--a matron at the Orphanage gave it to\nme. I used to imagine it could be a portrait of my mother--\"\n\n\"But my dear--\"\n\nThe brown girl shook her head. \"This ship-metal wedding ring Paul\nhammered out for me--that's the only Earth jewelry I want to keep.\nThis face that might be like my mother's--Oh, Doc, I'm getting to be a\nbig girl now. Besides, Lucifer will have plenty of pretties for us\nlater on. And Doc--let me do this, will you? They've got a woman\nleading 'em, so--wouldn't she be less afraid of another woman? I'll\nuncover, so she--\" Dorothy shrugged out of her jacket. \"Please, Doc?\nI'm scared, but--\"\n\nWright glanced helplessly at Paul. \"We--\"\n\nDorothy said quickly, \"_My_ decision.\" Holding the locket up for the\nsun to gleam on it, she walked into the meadow and waited in the\nbrightness. Paul's hand sweated on the rifle stock. He saw Wright\npatting Mijok's arm, heard his restraining murmur: \"Quiet, Mijok--keep\nyour shirt on, Mijok, old man--man....\" Mijok searched the face of his\ngod with a mute desperation and remained as he was.\n\nThe pygmy woman halted fifty feet away in still-faced musing. As Paul\nhad seen through the binoculars, she was elaborately tattooed and\nyoung. The pause was long. Dorothy stepped nearer to the place where\nWright had left the bones, displaying the locket, her open left hand\nwaving down at her body to demonstrate that she carried no weapons.\nFor the first time Paul realized she had left her holster belt behind.\n\nThe blue-skirted woman shrilled a word; her two followers fell back.\nShe thrust the blunt end of her spear in the ground and came forward\nsteadily until she was only a few feet from the woman of the\ntwenty-first century; mask-faced, she met Dorothy's smile with a long\nscrutiny. Now and then the green eyes shifted to study the clearing,\nthe lifeboat, the quiet shapes of Paul and Wright. And Mijok. Perhaps\nshe stared longest at Mijok, but by some heavy discipline her face\nrefused to tell of anything but dignity and caution.\n\nShe spoke at last. It was complex, in a tone like the piping of a tree\nfrog. There were pauses, studied inflections, no gestures: her\nseven-fingered hands hung limp against the blue grass skirt. The\nclosing words seemed to have a note of questioning and of sternness;\nshe waited.\n\nDorothy's contralto was startlingly deep in contrast: \"Darling, I\nwould like to know where you picked up that perfectly adorable\nwrap-around, only I don't think it would suit me. I'm, to put it\nfrankly, a shade too hippy for such. In case you're wondering, I'm a\nfemale sample of man\"--she touched herself and pointed to the pygmy\nlady--\"man--\"\n\n\"Oh!\" Wright whispered. \"Good girl, good--\"\n\n\"--and it does seem to me us girls ought to stick together,\nbecause\"--she held out the locket--\"well, just because. And anyway\nlook: I have only ten toes, fastened on to the ends of my feet, and if\nI had more, Heaven knows (just count 'em and _see_ how each grows!)\nI'd have trouble in keeping them neat. Pome. There now, sweetie pie,\nplease take it, huh?\" And she opened the locket--Paul remembering in\nlessening panic how much the unknown portrait did resemble her--and\nheld it face out to the woman of Lucifer. A tiny palm came up\ndubiously; Dorothy placed the locket in it. \"It won't bite, baby.\" The\npygmy woman turned it about, puzzling at the hinge. Dorothy stooped to\ndemonstrate the mechanism a few times. \"I'm Dorothy, by the way, more\nwidely known as the Dope, which is a title of uncommon distinction\namong my people, achieved only after long study of the art of saying\nthe right thing at the wrong time, burning the bacon, and preserving\nat all times an air of sweet and addled dignity--Dorothy....\" She\nindicated herself plainly and pointed, with questioning eyebrows.\n\nThe tree-frog voice, with no sternness, but a hint of friendliness:\n\"Tor-o-thee...?\" She imitated Dorothy's motions. \"Abro Pakriaa--\"\n\n\"Pakriaa.\"\n\n\"Abro Pakriaa.\" There was sternness again in that correction.\n\n\"Abro Pakriaa....\"\n\nWright muttered, \"Royalty, I believe. Don't dare do any coaching.\nTrust Dot's instinct. Ah, here we go--\"\n\nThe pygmy woman had taken off her shell necklace. She crushed the\ndainty blue and yellow against her upper right breast; she set it for\na moment on her shining hairless skull, and then offered it. Wright\nsighed, shaken, \"It _had_ to work--exchange of gifts--a universal--\"\n\nWhen Dorothy dropped on one knee to take it, the mask relaxed for the\nfirst time in a wintry smile. Over the proud bald head went the chain\nof the locket, and Abro Pakriaa watched Dorothy put the necklace\non--fortunately it was long, even drooping a little below Dorothy's\nthroat. A flutter of red hands seemed to mean that Dorothy was to\nstand back; another motion brought forward the woman who carried the\nhide, her face a chip of red stone. The hide was unrolled, and the\nbones placed on it. There was more intricate speech, with touching of\nthe locket and graceful, apparently kindly waving of thin arms.\nDorothy responded: \"Four score and seven years ago....\" She went on to\nthe end without mirth or hesitation, fondling the shell necklace,\ngiving the words the power of music that belongs to them even apart\nfrom knowledge of their meaning. When she was silent, Abro Pakriaa\nmotioned the woman with the hide to go and held up her two hands\nclasped together, the Chinese salutation. She waited till Dorothy had\ndone the same and strode away, recovering her spear without a backward\nlook, vanishing under the trees.\n\nDorothy collapsed in the shadow of the barrier. Tentatively she\ngroaned: \"How'm I doing?\"\n\nWright snarled; \"Suppose you know that damn bowman had an arrow\ntrained on you the whole time?\"\n\nShe glanced at him, lips quivering. \"I was kind of aware of it.\"\n\n\"Can I,\" said Paul, \"touch the hand that touched the hand--\"\n\n\"Oh no. I ain' gonna 'sociate with no common scum no mo'.\"\n\nMijok stared in wonder at their sudden paroxysms of hysterical\nlaughter. He rumbled in doubt. Then the contagion caught him. Whatever\nhis own interpretation might be, he was bellowing, hammering his\nchest, rolling over on the moss and scattering handfuls of it while he\nroared.\n\nHe did not sober until he saw Wright drawing pictures on the\nearth--three stylized but obvious human figures, one small, one\nmedium-sized, one large. Only the middle one had five fingers. Wright\ngouged a circle around all three. He said, \"C'm'on, Mijok--language\nlesson.\"\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nThe trail was obvious only to the pygmies, through a border region of\nmeadow and forest that was full of dappled light, a warm hurry of life\nfeeding, struggling, wandering. Aware of his own power and readiness,\nable now to enjoy the shifting scents and noises of this new trail,\nPaul watched Ann's quick slenderness and the swing of Spearman's solid\nshoulders. They, and Sears Oliphant, had emerged unharmed from the\nillness. During a week unmeasurably long in retrospect, all six of the\nparty had found the ease and sureness of physical acclimation. Their\nbodies rejoiced in the hot clean air of day and the moist moderate\nnights; the only rebel was the Earth-born brain--grudging, frightened,\ntrailing, making endless reservations and timid of shadows. In Sears\nOliphant it was an almost open battle between a brave and curious mind\nand flesh that could not hide its wincing from pain and danger. His\n\"Oh my, yes\" had a tremor which angered himself and oppressed his\nnatural garrulity.\n\nWhen Ann Bryan had drifted out of the sleep of illness, Ed Spearman\nwas petting her hands, sponging her forehead. Paul had seen something\nhappen in Ann at that moment, like an innocent putting forth of leaves\nwhen winter is not surely gone. Ann had never taken a lover. On the\nship, not so much unawakened as unwilling, she had rejected all that;\nSpearman, making no secret of wanting her, had not been insistent. Nor\nhad he seemed outwardly much distressed, but (at a time when\nEarth-harbored youth of his nature would have been in their liveliest\nand most demanding prime) he had buried himself in _Argo's_ technical\nlibrary to the point of red-eyed exhaustion, a desperation of\nunceasing study in the technologies that Captain Jensen would have\nhelped him explore if Jensen had lived. Ann had read other matters\nafter the violin strings were gone, read and daydreamed. If she'd wept\n(and Paul thought she had) she had done it alone, in that pocket of a\nroom sacred to herself. To the others, she was a passionately silent\nadolescent turning into a tiredly silent woman, who made too much\npoint of doing her own work and asking for nothing.\n\nYes, Ann was different now. The thin beauty of her face, vivid white\nunder heavy black hair, was still too quiet, but with a troubled\nradiance. During this long week she had talked much with Dorothy--talk\nsuperficially inconsequential, but Paul assumed it had a meaning below\nwords, as if Ann had only just realized, probably without envy, that\nthe brown girl was a thousand years older in heart and mind.\n\nBeyond Ann and Spearman were the six bowmen of the escort, bodies\nbright with a sour-smelling oil, grouped around Abro Pakriaa at a\ndeferential distance. The princess wore Dorothy's locket. \"Abro,\" Paul\nhad learned, was best translated as \"princess\" or \"queen.\" A flame-red\nflower behind her ear caught sunlight from the early afternoon. Five\nothers were following Paul--women, with skirts of every tint but\nPakriaa's blue, taller than the men, carrying spears with blades of a\nwhite stone resembling quartz. The men were unvaryingly soft, rounded\nin contour, lacking the women's tough-sinewed vigor. It was plain,\nmerely from the manner of Abro Pakriaa and her spear bearers, that\namong this people to be a woman was to be a leader and soldier, no\ndoubt a hunter and head of the household by virtue of size and\nstrength. In muscular power, a male pygmy was to a female as the\nweakest of Earth's women was to the toughest male athlete. These of\nthe bodyguard were soldiers of a sort: the bows were small, the arrows\nonly big darts. The bowmen never spoke except meekly in response to\nsome patronizing word of the princess. Pakriaa's height topped forty\ninches; none of the bowmen was quite three feet tall. Paul's fingers\nitched for brush and palette. They were available in the lifeboat. The\nfact that he had not even unpacked them he blamed on a preoccupation\nwith the daily work needed for mere survival, but there was a deeper\nreason: perhaps a fear of finding his moderate ability vanished if he\nshould once try to hint with oil at the welling profusion of color and\nline that was Lucifer. Now he found himself trying to measure the\nquality of Pakriaa's rich copper against the softness of leaves that\nwere burnt umber, malachite green, saffron, purple, and he thought: _I\nmust be recovering. Wake up, ego, and look around._\n\nSpearman was carrying rifle and automatic; Paul had preferred to leave\nhis rifle behind; Ann, hating firearms, had only her knife.\n\nAbro Pakriaa had entered the camp at noon, her fourth visit in the\nweek. Her gloomy majesty unchanging, she had indicated that she wished\nthem to come to her village. But Dorothy had turned her ankle the\nevening before and it still pained her. Wright, no doubt hungering\nmore than any of the others for a sight of Pakriaa's way of living,\nhad fretted and bumbled and elected to remain with Dorothy and Sears,\nurging Paul needlessly to remember his anthropology. Sears, sweating\nout a microsection of a water insect from Lake Argo, had flapped a fat\nhand and boomed: \"You be sure 'n' telephone, damn it, if you're\nstaying for dinner, hey?\"\n\nRemaining uneasily close to Wright, as he did whenever the pygmies\nappeared, Mijok had said carefully, \"Telephone?\"\n\n\"Word without meaning,\" said Wright gently, patting the huge arm.\n\"Noise word for fun.\"\n\nThe attitude of Pakriaa's people to Mijok suggested the studious\nignoring of an indecency. They would not harm the ugly animal, their\nmanner said, so long as he was the property of the important sky\npeople....\n\nLife was generously abundant in this thinner forest. Things buzzed and\nflew; Paul noticed a few webs cunningly extended before burrows in the\nhumus. Ann's ocean-gray eyes glanced back, brave and uncertain. \"Those\ngirls are too quiet. Paul, how much _do_ they know of our language?\"\n\n\"Not much.\" He moved up to walk on her other side. \"Doc and I have\nmade only those two efforts to swap languages. A lot of that time had\nto be wasted on theirs, a dead end for us.\"\n\nSpearman grunted, \"Why? They've got a civilization, as Doc says.\"\n\n\"Our voices are wrong. Pitch effects meaning for them. You've noticed\nthere's no pitch difference between their male and female voices.\nTheir language is tied to one section of the scale; a full octave of\nit is above the range of even Ann's voice. They can shape our words\nthough, if they're willing. Basic English may appeal to the princess\nwhen she condescends to take it seriously.\"\n\n\"They could have picked up more than we suspect. They could have been\neavesdropping outside the camp.\"\n\n\"No, Ed. Mijok would have known and told us.\"\n\n\"Yeah--Fido. Can hardly speak freely in front of him now.\"\n\n\"Don't think anything you wouldn't want him to hear.\"\n\n\"Paul, I swear, sometimes you're worse than Doc.\" But Spearman wanted\nto cancel the ill temper of the remark, and added: \"You know, I\nthought _I_ knew something about Basic English--we all had drill\nenough in it. Beats me, the things Doc can do with it--the man's a\nwizard.\"\n\nPaul was silent with unappeased annoyance. It was true: Mijok appeared\nto be a natural student too, already far beyond Basic English in a\nweek of keen listening. \"Nan,\" Paul said, \"how did you like Mijok's\nhumming when you were singing for us yesterday evening?\"\n\n\"Good.\" She flashed him an almost cheerful smile. But when Ann spoke\nof her singing--and in the singing itself--there was, in spite of her,\nan aching wordless reminder of the violin gone silent. Her voice was\nsweet but without strength or resonance, and she took no ardent\npleasure in using it. Her love was the violin--covered as well as\nmight be in the comparative safety of the lifeboat, waiting for a\ndistant day. If the day ever came (Sears had already dissected out,\ndried, and oiled some long leg-tendon fibers of a deerlike animal in a\nhumble experiment aimed chiefly at Ann's morale)--if the day came,\nthere would still be no piano, no answering of other strings, no\nsplendid cry of brass. Crude wood winds, perhaps, sometime.... \"Yes,\nhe was good,\" said Ann, smiling. \"Organ point in the tonic, and right\nin our own scale. Once he even upped to the dominant. Instinct, huh?\nSounded good, Paul, even with you trying to fill in the middle.\"\n\n\"Hell, I didn't think you heard me,\" Spearman snorted.\n\n\"You kind of stood out,\" she said, \"because Mijok was much better on\npitch, my good man. It did sound hollow without something to fill in.\nHe was on A-flat below the bass clef and no fooling.... _Why_ haven't\nwe seen other giants?\"\n\n\"We got something on that this morning. I guess it was while you were\nin swimming. Each giant male has an inviolate hunting territory, and\nthey don't trespass. Definite breeding season: the month before the\nrains. That was five or maybe six red-moon changes ago. Mijok wasn't\ntoo clear on the count--doesn't like mathematics much better than I\ndo. The women go where they please, in small groups, with the children\nwho still need care, but I gather the males are expected to stay in\ntheir own private grounds until the Red-Moon-before-the-Rains.\"\n\nSpearman wondered: \"Will the pygmies have a season too?\"\n\n\"Doubt it. Probably like us--except that women are the bosses. The\nclothes suggest a continuing sex consciousness.\"\n\nThe pygmy leaders halted. A murmuring explained itself as the music of\na stream. Paul consulted his memory of the map made from orbit\nphotographs and of his one solo exploration flight in the lifeboat.\nThere could be few such flights: the charlesite, even with the surplus\nsalvaged from the wrecked boat, must be hoarded. Ann and Ed had flown\nover the lake on the day after their recovery, searching for any sign\nof _Argo_. Returning, Ed's face had been a leather mask of grief, and\nneither had wanted to talk of it. Later they explained: the lake was a\nprofundity of secret blue; a shelf of sand or possibly white stone ran\nout some yards offshore, under water marvelously clear, and ended\nabruptly. Beyond it, where _Argo_ must have fallen, no bottom could\neven be guessed at; the lifeboat's camera confirmed the presence of an\nabyss that would have thwarted the most complex twenty-first-century\nmachinery.\n\nThis stream, Paul knew, came from the western hills, flowing east and\nslightly north until it entered the lake northeast of the clearing\ncalled home. Another creek joined it east of the spot where they now\nstood, and Pakriaa's village--if the parallel lines did represent its\nlocation--was not far upstream from that junction.\n\nWorn boulders rose above noisy water. The stream was twenty yards\nwide, sluggish even here in the shallows. A steppingstone crossing.\n\nNearly all the rivers on the map passed through jungle for most of\ntheir length; numberless smaller streams would be hidden from the sky.\nThere was grassland for fifteen to twenty miles on the eastern side of\nevery range of hills. The prevailing winds were from the west; perhaps\na dryness in the lee of the hills favored the grass. The broadest\nstretch of such open land lay east of a rugged coastal range seventy\nmiles to the southwest; some of the mountains in that seacoast\nformation were mighty enough to hold a blur of snow at their summits.\nThe base of the coastal range was narrow--hardly more than twenty\nmiles. From this the peaks shot up with incredible sheerness to great\nheights of bare rock that glittered in morning sun like black and red\nglass. This grandeur, like nothing known on Earth, was clearly visible\nfrom the camp above the near hills, especially at midday, when the\nmists were gone.\n\nAnd ten miles offshore from that dizzy range, Paul remembered a\nmountainous island. On his solo exploration two days ago, with the\nlifeboat's panoramic camera and a head full of puzzled dreams, he had\nsoared above it, noting a peninsular strip of red sand at its southern\nend, sheltered mountain valleys--one framing a jewel of lake. In the\nnorth was a white beach where landing should be easy, and this was\nprotected by a low headland of red cliffs running out to the very tip\nof the island. Surely a place to carry in the mind, it seemed to\ninvite human living as did no other near region in this continent of\nLucifer. Wright thought so: he listened to Paul's description and\nnamed the island Adelphi....\n\nNorth of the camp, the range of low western hills dwindled to rolling\nland and was lost in a tremendous expanse of unbroken jungle, which\nended only at the shore of one of the great lakes four hundred miles\naway--an inland sea fourteen hundred miles long. Sixty-odd miles to\nthe south there was that large cluster of parallel lines in jungle,\nand beyond it the forest gave way to more open ground, prairie, red\ndesert, and bare mountains.\n\nAbro Pakriaa dipped her spear in the water; she lifted a handful,\nletting it trickle away while she spoke a rippling invocation; then\nshe was lithely crossing on the stones after the bowmen. The bottom\nwas pale sand with varicolored pebbles.\n\nBeyond the stream, Pakriaa followed a path a short way and pressed\ninto undergrowth. Spearman grumbled, \"Good path for once, and we have\nto--\"\n\n\"Path's probably booby-trapped. She expects us to know that.\"\n\n\"Hell....\" It was difficult passage, stooping on a trail meant for\nlittle folk; it ended at a ditch six feet wide and five deep. The\nditch made a right angle, both lines stretching away straightly as far\nas the eye could go; the inner side of the ditch was heaped with dry\nsticks and bundles of grass. Pakriaa trilled orders to an old\nblack-skirted woman with a whip, in charge of a gang of four women and\nthree men, all totally naked. They were struggling to shove a movable\nbridge into place across the ditch--two logs bearing a mat of vines\nand bark. It was grunting work for them, and when the end of the\nbridge was in reach, Pakriaa's escort made no motion to help. Spearman\nstarted to; Paul interfered. \"We'd lose face. Those are slaves. Women\ntied together at the ankles--one of the men a eunuch. Look at the\nbrands on their cheeks. Nan, you're the dominant sex--try to look more\nlike the president of a women's club.\"\n\nHer finely modeled face had dignity enough, he thought, if she could\nkeep the worry out of it.... The old woman in the black skirt bowed\narrogantly to Pakriaa; the slaves cringed, with the hating stare of\nthe trapped. All were scarred and young except for the eunuch, who was\nwrinkled and flabby. One female had a recent chest wound; the effort\nat the bridge had made it bleed, but she ignored it. Paul saw\nSpearman's face settle into lines of poker blankness and thought:\n_Good_. _And if, to patience and courage, he could add (I hear you,\nDoc) charity and self-knowledge--Oh, be quiet, critic, be quiet._...\n\nTrees had been felled--some time ago, for the stumps were rotted--and\nthe spacing was such that the tops of the trees left standing provided\na gap twenty feet wide, the entire length of the village. There would\nbe two other such gaps, visible from the sky as parallel lines,\nadmitting full midday sunlight but shutting out the omasha.\n\"Nan--let's try to learn something about that big settlement in the\nsouth--the other parallel lines.\"\n\nIt was surprisingly easy to convey the question to Pakriaa with the\nhelp of signs, but her response when she understood it was a shrill\nsnarl and shaking of her spear, a repetition of a name, \"Vestoia,\"\nwhich seemed to be the place, and of another name, \"Lantis,\" a name\nthat caught in her throat and made her spit. Paul said, \"We make faces\nat the south too, and do it fast.\" It seemed to appease the princess:\nshe even smiled.\n\nThe area bordering the ditch had been left wild, a barrier of vines,\nbrush, untended trees. Inside were orderly rows of plants, some\nbroad-leaved, resembling beets, some bushy; another type was rangy\nwith cosmos-shaped blooms of startling emerald green. Near the row of\ntrees was a path which Pakriaa followed; under the trees stood\ngrass-thatched structures. Paul counted thirty, well separated, before\nthe princess left the path, and no sound came from them. The trees\nwere mostly of the same species, thin-trunked towers with dark\nserrated leaves, blazing with scarlet blossoms like the one Pakriaa\nwore. They were the source of an odor like frangipani which filled the\nvillage, heady and sweet but clean. It was no primitive agriculture in\nthis part-sunny corridor: rich darkness of earth was drawn up about\nthe plants; there was not a weed in sight. And there was no trace of\nthe strangling purple vines.\n\nPakriaa's male attendants had slipped away; her spearwomen accompanied\nher through an opening into the next corridor, where her people were\nwaiting for her, the soldier women in three formal ranks. There were\nabout fifty in each rank, and here again were dyed skirts of every\ncolor but the regal blue that was Abro Pakriaa's. Small faces\nmaintained the flat indifference of the unliving copper they\nresembled.\n\nPakriaa's intricate oratory flowed over them. More than two thirds of\nthe stiff soldiers were gashed with recent wounds, ranging from\nscratches to lost hands or breasts or eyes. Some had deep body wounds\nso ugly it was amazing that they could stand upright, but there\nseemed to be no evidence of infection and there was no wavering in the\nlines while Pakriaa declaimed. Her right hand soared with spread\nfingers. The lifeboat? The name Torothee occurred; when it was\nrepeated the women swayed with unchanging faces, murmuring it in\nunison like a breath of wind. Pakriaa faced her guests. Tears were not\nunknown to her; laughter might be. She clenched and relaxed her hands,\nthe fourteen fingers rising and falling until Paul lost count of the\nmotions--more than twenty. She pointed to the soldiers, repeating the\ndisplay more slowly and only ten times; then one hand rose alone with\nthe thumb curled under. Paul muttered, \"I think she's saying only 146\nare left after the war, from--maybe three hundred.\"\n\nPakriaa laid her spear at Ann's feet. Paul advised: \"Give her your\nknife, same way.\" Pakriaa took it and placed it across the spear and\nstood back, motioning to Ann to do the same. When the three had\nwithdrawn, Pakriaa still made impatient gestures. Paul whispered, \"Ed,\nyou and I are trifling males. We stand further back.\"\n\n\"We do like hell,\" said Spearman in his throat.\n\n\"We do, just the same. It's nothing but ceremony. Safety's off on my\n.38. We can handle anything. Stand back.\"\n\nEd Spearman stood back, muttering. At a shrill summons from Pakriaa, a\nshuffling procession swung out from the tree shadows. These were all\nmen, decrepit, ancient, dirty; some limped and two had empty eye\nsockets and one, from a pathological fatness, could barely waddle.\nThey were striped and splotched with paint in elaborate designs,\nmostly of white and yellow, and their skins, either with dirt or age,\nhad darkened to dull mahogany. They formed a hobbling circle around\nthe crossed knife and spear; each grotesque, as he passed the weapons,\nspat on them and scattered on them a handful of earth until the place\nbecame a low mound. As they did this, they muttered and howled and\nsqueaked, performing precise evolutions with twiddling fingers. They\ncarried white thigh-bones like clubs, and shell ornaments jangled on\ntheir raddled throats and ankles. It was, on the surface, a simple\nceremony of peace and friendship, but the casual contempt of these\nmale witches cast a foulness over it. Their sidelong glances at the\nstrangers were poisonous with furtive malignancy. \"Medicine men,\"\nsaid Paul under his breath. \"Distant equivalent of the wise women in\nsome patriarchal groups. Ed, we stay on the good side of those loopy\nscarecrows, or it's just too bad.\" And with a certain hunger he\nstudied the mask of the man who had never offered the relaxation of\nfriendship, wondering how far it was physically possible for Spearman\nto accept a world in which engineering science was the dream and crude\nsurvival the reality.\n\nThe ceremony ended in a dribble of anticlimax. The hideous old men\nmerely shambled away from the mound toward the shadows after a\nceremonial whoop that caused the soldiers to relax. But they did not\nquite go. They huddled and squatted under the trees. They stared. They\nspat and scratched and consulted together. Some of the green eyes were\nclose-lidded, veiled; others were wide, making no effort to conceal a\nhatred compounded of jealousy and fear. The fat monster nursed his\nobscene belly between scrawny knees and whispered a stream of\ninformation into the close ear of a witch with empty eye sockets, and\nthe whispering dark lips wore a destroying smile.\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nAbro Pakriaa motioned her guests to be seated before a large building;\nthe fibers of this structure were dyed the blue of her skirt. The\nsoldiers stalked about in a show of nonchalance. Young men and naked\nchildren had come timidly from the houses. The youngest children were\ndisproportionately tiny, large-headed but no bigger than house cats.\nPerhaps childbirth for this race was no more than a passing\ninconvenience. There were many pairs of obviously identical twins. The\nchildren stayed near the protective men, all but the older girls, who\nventured somewhat closer.\n\nIt was a village without laughter. No scampering, no horseplay, no\nevidence of any tenderness except between the men and the smallest\nchildren. Curiosity burned in all of them, but its overt expression\nwas limited to the dead-pan stare.\n\nPakriaa entered her blue building alone, greeted by a flutter of\nvoices from within, and she was gone several minutes. When Pakriaa had\nseated her guests, most of the ancient painted males had shuffled\nacross the clearing--even the fat horror whose walking must have been\npain--to settle in the shadows on the other side and continue their\nbaleful watching. Paul noticed that even the spear-carrying women\nskipped clear to give them elbow-room and never looked directly at\nthem. The fat witch found a place to squat that gave him a clear view\nof all three visitors; as he gazed he sucked toothlessly at the knob\nof his thighbone club.\n\nThe houses were lightly framed of wood, with walls of interwoven fiber\ntwo thirds of the way to the eaves, joints bound and roofs thatched\nwith the same material, a design similar to what Paul remembered from\na year spent in the Republic of Oceania. The modern citizens of that\nmany-islanded republic, Paul recollected, still preferred the\nancestral savage building pattern to stone or plastic; it suited the\nclimate and the friendly, unpretentious way of life. But none of the\nbuildings here was raised on supports: snakes and vicious insects were\nevidently no problem. There were no domestic animals, apparently no\nparasites nor self-evident diseases; except for wounds and the dirt of\nthe old men, the pygmy skins looked clear and healthy. There were not\neven any bad smells except the mildly disagreeable oil the males used\nto anoint their bodies.\n\nPakriaa returned, with her make-up on. She had flowers behind both\nears, and one tied by its stem to Dorothy's locket. Heavy white\ncircles were drawn about the lady's eyes and breasts and navel; blue\nbracelets dangled at her wrists; her skirt had been replaced by an\ninnocently unconcealing fringe of shells--similar to snail shells,\nPaul thought. Pakriaa's anklets of wooden beads were orange. The top\nof her bald head was robin's-egg blue. Two males, with the brand marks\nthat must mean slavery, followed her with a seat--a block of wood,\ncleverly carved with stylized animal figures. It brought her face on a\nlevel with Ann's. Ann said politely, \"Why the hell can't I be handsome\ntoo?\" And Pakriaa inclined her head. A boy without the slave brand\ncame with a wooden bowl; Pakriaa sipped the greenish liquid and\noffered the bowl to Ann. Spearman rumbled. Paul said, \"Protocol. You\ngotta, Nan, but don't offer us any--we're meek males.\"\n\nAnn swallowed some; her eyes watered; she repressed choking.\n\"Alcoholic, I do mean....\"\n\nFeasting followed--a laborious hour of it, as food arrived without\npause in the hands of branded men from the other side of the\nsheltering trees. Wood smoke drifted from that direction, and a hum of\nvoices. All the dishes included meat cut in tiny cubes--stewed, fried,\nboiled, or smothered in unknown vegetables. Only one course was\naggressively horrid, carrion swimming in peppery sauce, clearly a\nfavorite of Pakriaa's, for she belched wonderfully and patted her\nstomach in self-applause. Ann remarked, \"Another go at that and I\nstart looking for another planet.\"\n\nIn time even Pakriaa had had enough. She clapped her broad hands.\nGreasy-mouthed and bulging, the soldiers formed a swaying, stamping\nline. Spearman burped helplessly. \"All that inside, and they can\ndance?\"\n\nAnn suggested: \"Maybe it helps....\"\n\nIt was an hour-long narrative dance, vastly monotonous, a picture of\nwar. Some of those most cruelly wounded pranced into solo pantomimes\nbragging of how the injuries had been received. In climax, a straw\nfigure of a woman was dragged to the center of the clearing: an image\ncarefully made, brightly painted, the face hideous, the sexual\nfeatures grossly exaggerated. Shrilling what seemed to be a name\n(\"Lantis! Lantis!\"), the soldiers swarmed on this effigy, squealing,\nstabbing, defiling, tearing it into shreds, which they carried away as\ntreasures or mementos.\n\nWhen the soldier women had finished in yawning exhaustion, a crowd of\ndainty men performed another sort of dance, purely an erotic show,\nindicating that the role of the male was seductive, half infantile,\nsubmissive all the way. Occasionally a soldier pulled a dancer out of\nthe line, slapping his face until he stopped the squealing that was\nevidently required of him, and wandered away with him; but most of the\nsoldiers were too tired, gorged, or wounded to be interested. Later,\nsome twenty soldiers formed a group, and men brought them babies to be\nnursed, morsels of humanity, quite silent, far smaller in proportion\nthan Earth's newborn. The mothers' arms were careful and competent,\nwithout tenderness; they held the infants two at a time, examining\nthem shrewdly, often exchanging them with other soldiers. There were a\nfew cooing demonstrations of affection by the men toward these\ninfants, demonstrations which the soldiers ignored. Ann whispered, \"I\ncould spend a lot of time hating these little devils.\"\n\n\"Try not to.\"\n\n\"I know, Paul, but--\"\n\n\"At least they have a civilization.\" Spearman was arguing with\nhimself. \"A potential technology. That's good gardening. Good tools,\nweapons.\"\n\n\"Nan, see if you can ask Mrs. President to show us the town.\"\n\nPakriaa caught on swiftly and was delighted....\n\nThe first of the tree-sheltered areas contained all the dwelling\nhouses, dulled by the splendor of Pakriaa's. Ann was invited to enter\nthis blue palace, Pakriaa making it clear that the men must not\nfollow. Ann emerged, red-faced. Later, when it would not be so patent\nthat she was talking of Pakriaa's house, Ann said, \"Couldn't make out\nmuch detail. Dim, and no lamps burning, though I think I saw some clay\nthings like old Roman lamps. Clean, funny perfume smells. I met--her\nmother maybe. Incredibly old anyway, and almost black. Their skin must\nchange color with age.\"\n\n\"Dirt more likely,\" Spearman said.\n\n\"Not a bit of it. Very clean. Just a dry little ghost in a fancy room\nof her own, with a--a male slave manicuring her toenails. We haven't\nseen any old women out in the open.\"\n\n\"Sheltered and reverenced, maybe,\" Paul said. \"Natural.\"\n\n\"Her Highness has a--I suppose you'd have to call it a harem. Ten\nlittle husbands, or maybe eleven.\"\n\n\"What a girl!\" said Spearman.\n\nAnn was amused, though her cheeks were flaming. \"I was offered one.\"\n\n\"Hope you explained the rejection implied no lack of merit.\"\n\n\"Tried to, Paul. I think I got over the idea that there was a taboo\ninvolved--something like that. Her Majesty didn't insist....\"\n\nThe ditch enclosed the village. One side of its square paralleled the\nriver, not more than thirty feet from it but making no connection. It\nwould have been easy to flood the ditch, but that was evidently not\nthe intention. When Ann conveyed curiosity, Pakriaa was astonished\nthat anyone could be ignorant of its function. \"_Kaksma!_\" she said,\nand pointed west. \"Kaksma...!\" Convinced at last that Ann's puzzlement\nwas genuine, she drew a picture on the earth, with such vigorous art\nthat she herself feared the image and drew back. It was a profile view\nof an animal larger than a rat, long-headed with a hump on the back.\nShe had given it a tiny eye and a forward-thrusting tooth nothing like\na rodent's; the forefoot was broad and flattened, a digger's foot.\nGiving Ann only a brief time to study it, Pakriaa spat on the image\nand wiped it out with a violent heel. She muttered an angry\nincantation and pointed to the dry wood heaped by the ditch, while her\ndancing fingers told of flames that would defend the village....\n\nIn the second tree-sheltered area were the industries. Men, not\nslaves, glanced up from the shaping of earthenware vessels. They had\nno potter's wheel, only their hands, but there was a kiln of baked\nearth. Pakriaa called a favorite over, hugged him, and sent him back\nwith a pat on the rump. He was quite old, toothless, and giggling.\nThey passed a row of dye pots, three women braiding fiber into flat\nsheets, a square of ground with part-finished spearheads, arrow\npoints, other devices, a rack where deerlike hides were stretched in\nsome curing process. \"They sleep on those,\" Ann said, \"and use 'em for\nrugs. The palace was full of 'em....\"\n\nIn the rear of the village was a stockade of stripped logs, guarded by\ntwo soldier women. In the space before it, but facing away from it so\nthat the painted eyes brooded over the village, stood a monstrous\nwooden idol, eight feet tall, raised on a low platform. Pakriaa led\nher guests before the image and knelt. It was necessary to do the\nsame, and Ann imitated her gracefully enough. As he knelt himself,\nPaul saw in a backward glance that three gangling male witches had\nfollowed and were observing every motion with a rigid malevolence. It\nwas difficult to kneel with his back to them; Spearman, he hoped, had\nnot seen them.\n\nThe idol was exaggeratedly female, with huge carnivorous teeth\nindicated in white paint. A slot representing the left hand carried a\nnine-foot spear upright. The right arm, a natural branch of the log,\nreached forward and spread into a rugged table; more wood had been\nneatly joined to make the table five feet long, but the whole gave the\neffect of a swollen accepting hand, and it was foul with bloodstains\nold and new. Pakriaa's long murmured prayer repeated the name Ismar\nmany times. At the end she seemed satisfied; her glance at Ann was\nalmost a smile. Paul saw that the witches had drifted away, but the\npressure of their watching remained.\n\nPakriaa now took them into the stockade. It seemed to Paul that the\nguards were scarcely needed....\n\nThese naked men, women, and children had no danger in them. No life.\nThey moved and functioned as if in life: walked, spat, scratched,\nyawned; a woman nursed a baby mechanically; a man strolled to a trough\nin the center of the compound and ate a handful of damp stuff like\npoultry mash, then rubbed his side against the wooden edge as a pig\nmight. Beyond such elemental motions there was no life. A woman\nfollowed a man for several paces; both flight and pursuit were dull,\nunfinished, a fumbling response to a sluggish stimulus. They paid no\nattention to Pakriaa and the strangers. The slack emptiness of their\nfaces denied the possibility of any thought more than a flurry in\nresponse to physical need. They were all over-plump; some of the\nfemales were scarred, but the wounds were old and healed. Paul could\nsee no anatomical differences between them and their lively free\nkindred. A drug...?\n\nPakriaa walked among them like a farmer in a flock of chickens. She\nlifted a young girl, who made no effort to escape, and showed her to\nAnn with contented pride, pinching a fat thigh and middle. The child\nwas limp, unexcited, mumbling a mouthful of the mash. Fighting back a\nretching, Ann muttered, \"Paul, when can we get out of here?\"\n\nAbro Pakriaa caught the tone. She tossed the little girl away and led them\nout of the stockade. She seemed hurt rather than angry--disappointed that\nher important friends had shown no admiration at this thriving industry....\n\nThe soldiers had gathered again in the clearing, but now there was a\nwaiting, a tension with the descent of twilight, and a gloom. A long\nfire had been built; Pakriaa's wave at her guests appeared to mean\nthat they should sit where they pleased. Ann had not been able to\nconvey the wish for an escort home, and Pakriaa's mind was plainly\nfilled with some other, graver concern, having no more time for\nhospitality. Pakriaa entered her blue house. While she was gone, the\nsoldiers seated beyond the fire scattered handfuls of earth in\nsynchronized motions and the witches grouped behind them set up a\nmonotone of chanting. Pakriaa returned wearing a white skirt, bare of\nall her paint and jewelry; she walked back and forth along the line of\nthe fire, praying, until daylight was wholly gone. At her call, old\nmen, neither painted nor grotesque, carried out burdened hides and\nlaid them open beside the fire: white bones, broken weapons, skirts,\nloincloths, necklaces, arrows, little earthen pots and wooden bowls,\nmany images of clay. The soldiers threw themselves face down, their\nforeheads on their arms, and wailed.\n\nSpearman's voice was tortured with perplexity: \"Eat some, mourn for\nothers. Murder them and love them--\"\n\n\"Yes, they're human.\"\n\n\"Oh, shut up, Paul. What do you mean, human? These animals?\"\n\n\"Human mourning, isn't it? Listen to it.\"\n\nAnn spoke with held-in fury: \"At least we're not cannibals. There may\nstill be war back on Earth, but after all--\"\n\n\"Better to murder in groups of a thousand at long distance? Just\nlisten to it, Ann....\"\n\nIt was music, becoming after a time the only thing existing under the\nred moon and the delicate unceasing dance of blue fireflies. It was\nthe music they had heard on the first night in the jungle, a pouring\nforth of lamentation, wonder, supplication, whatever the spirit may\nfeel in the contemplation of death and its troubling counterpart. A\nmusic that was meant to go on unchanging as the song of tree frogs for\nthe thirteen hours of a night of Lucifer.... Pakriaa took no vocal\npart in the ritual, but sat alone, guarding the relics of the fallen.\nFrom time to time small man shapes carried new fuel to the fire. And\nthere were stern sidelong glances from the princess: she had not\nforgotten her guests. Once or twice Paul caught himself dozing off,\ndragged into a partial hypnosis by the endless lamentation....\n\n\"Paul?\"\n\n\"Yes, Nan. I'm awake.\" He saw Spearman's head jerk upright.\n\n\"Doc asked me yesterday--if I would bear him a child.\"\n\nSpearman's arm sought for her gently. \"Why bring that up now? Can't\nthink with all this damn caterwauling.\"\n\n\"I--did get to thinking.... Everything we used to live by--it's so\nfar away. Paul, you're close to Doc. You understand him, I guess.\"\n\nTwo troubled faces were turned to Paul in the mystery of firelight. A\nglance from Pakriaa conveyed annoyance at the sound of voices.\n\"Dorothy told me she wants Sears to be the father of her second. It\nwon't take her away from me. Not natural perhaps, but right under the\ncircumstances. Some of the most important laws and customs can't be\nstarted by us. They'll be established by our grandchildren, if we can\nhave them.\"\n\n\"I know.\" But her upward look at Spearman's worried, half-angry face\nsaid that her decision would be made by him, no other.\n\n\"He mustn't talk. The queen no like....\"\n\nIt might have been an hour later that Paul saw Spearman's head sag\ndown on his chest. Ann leaned against him, but his arm around her had\ngone slack. Paul searched for the cause of a sense of danger that\nprickled his skin. Not the witches: they were grouped as before,\nchanting a faint counterpoint to the soldiers' wailing. No--it was Ed\nSpearman himself, and Paul came broad awake in a certainty of what\nwould happen. Too late. Spearman's head twitched, and his unconscious\nthroat let loose a resonant, uncompromising snore, a snore that had\nbeen famous on the great ship _Argo_. Sears Oliphant had always\nclaimed that if only Ed could be harnessed in sleep to the reaction\nchamber.... But this was not going to be funny....\n\nPakriaa leaped up and shrieked a raging order. The wailing ceased. The\nsoldiers were staggering upright, grabbing spears, forming a circle of\nviolence around the guests before Spearman could even rise. He gasped,\n\"Wha's matter?\" and ten pygmy women were hauling him away by wrists\nand ankles, clear of the ground.\n\nPaul shouted. \"Don't fight 'em, Ed! Keep quiet!\" Two soldiers were\nclinging to each of his own arms, there was a ring of shivering spears\naround him, and others had dragged Ann out of sight, but she was\nscreaming as if they could understand: \"Don't hurt him! He didn't do\nanything! Let him go!\"\n\nWithout twitching his hampered arms, Paul moved slowly against the\ncircle of spears. They had no quarrel with him, he sensed, but only\nmeant to restrain him: it was at least the only action worth a gamble.\nThe spearwomen stepped backward away from him. The whole circle moved\nin slow motion, following where Spearman had been carried--through the\ntree shelter, on across the next clearing, and into the space before\nthe looming god.\n\nEd had not been able to snatch his rifle; he still had his holstered\nautomatic. Paul could not see Ann, nor Pakriaa. He could see\nSpearman's face, a concentration of craft and fighting fury. The pygmy\nwomen lifted him and flung him on the table before the idol. He was\nready. He bounced like a great cat, gained his feet, and twitched out\nthe pistol, which banged once--at the huge blade of the idol's spear.\nThe stone blade crumbled; the crash of the little gun made his captors\nwince back in shocked reaction. Then Ed Spearman stooped, grasped the\nreaching wrist of the idol, and heaved upward with the whole of his\nstrength.\n\nThe god swayed, groaned like a thing of life, and toppled over,\nsquashing one of the howling witches--a blind one--like a red bug.\n\nThe village dropped into total silence. Paul could see Ann now. The\npygmies had let her go. The whiteness of her face had more than terror\nin it: it had exultation, a glory of excitement and wrath. Paul's own\ncaptors had lurched away; his automatic had slipped into his hand\nwithout conscious effort; he searched in desperation for something\nthat might restore his friends to steadier sanity. \"Walk,\" he said.\n\"Walk, don't run, to the nearest exit....\"\n\nThe pygmies allowed it. The god had fallen. They even stood back, too\nprofoundly dazed for any thought or protest.... At the edge of the\nvillage Spearman jumped in the ditch, reached for Ann, swung her up on\nthe other side. \"Did anyone bring a flashlight?\"\n\n\"Oh, I--I did,\" said Ann, and began to cry. \"Brought\nflashlight--'stead of gun....\"\n\nPaul stayed in the rear. \"They won't follow, I think. Not for a\nwhile.\"\n\nThe stooping passageway was hard to find. But when they won clear of\nit there was the guiding sound of the stream. Paul held the\nflashlight on the line of stepping stones until the others had\ncrossed. Ann was still weeping in reaction. \"We'll never win. It's all\nmadness--the ship, everything. All human beings are crazy, crazy--\"\n\n\"Hush, dear,\" Spearman said. \"We got out, didn't we?\"\n\nNow, where was the trail? A madness of groping, blundering, where\nthere was no path, no guidance, and even their little thread of light\na mockery and confusion.\n\nAbruptly, ahead of them, there were other lights, then voices--Mijok's\nsoft rumbling, Wright's clear outcry: \"There they are! All three,\nMijok--\"\n\nPaul ran to him. \"The others--Dorothy? Sears?\"\n\n\"Right as rain, son,\" Wright mumbled. \"Except Dot's been frantic about\nyou since we heard the shot. We left Sears practically sitting on\nher--well, figuratively. Women are odd, you know: they don't like\nshots in the night when the best boy friend is out on the tiles.\"\n\n\"Had a little trouble. They may come after us--don't know....\"\n\nAnn was quiet. Paul saw her white hands starfished on the gray of\nMijok's chest. She said, \"Mijok, I'm tired and sick. Will you carry\nme?\"\n\nSpearman groaned: \"Ann, what--Use your head....\"\n\nBut Mijok knelt at once to make a cradle of his arms, and Christopher\nWright said, \"Why not? Why shouldn't we need each other?\" Mijok went\nahead with her on the blind trail.\n\nPaul heard Spearman choke: \"I would have carried her.\" It was not\nmeant to be heard. Paul looked away, hearing also the deep precision\nof the giant's voice exploring the mystery of words: \"You are my\npeople. I will not ever be much time far from you.\"\n\n\n\n\nPart Two\n\nThe Year One\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\"This island is Eden.\" Sears Oliphant spoke drowsily. Toy bat wings\nflickered from the woods crowning the hillside, hovered over a pond:\n_illuama_. In a scant year of Lucifer time (seventeen months of the\ncalendar of Earth) native names had become natural, mostly Mijok's\nnames.\n\nTwo red-moon changes ago, in the final jading month of the rains, the\npygmy word \"kaksma\" had been only a symbol. Now it woke the image of a\nvillage desolate, bones scraped and scarred. The mind's eye winced in\npity--a sentry careless, a bridge left in place after dark; thousands\nof ratty bodies rustling down from the wet hills, over open ground,\nswimming swollen streams, finding the bridge before oil on the rain\nwater in the ditch could be ignited. Small bodies, not swift, leaping\nor humping along like furry worms, sniffing, squeaking, their stabbing\nteeth dark with the blood of any flesh that moved. The northernmost of\nthe villages allied with Pakriaa's had already returned to jungle.\n\nBut here, ten miles offshore from the coastal range, no kaksmas lived;\nSears and Paul, in two days of study on this second visit, had\nestablished that. No wide wings lurked in the sky. The hilly island\nhad no large meadows where omasha could hunt. Three giants had been\nflown to the island a month ago--the girl Arek, her mother Muson, and\nold Rak. They said it was a place of calm. Their soft talk could be\nheard up the slope, where a log building was growing. Paul stretched,\nlean and comfortable, on the grass, glad to be alone for a while with\nthis least demanding of his friends.\n\nSears was fatter, but hardened, a round block of man, with a coarse\nblack beard, kindness of brown eyes unaltered. Christopher Wright,\nwaiting at the \"fortress\" by Lake Argo and no doubt frantic for word\nof this exploration, had let his beard grow too, sandy gray. Spearman\nand Paul had stayed clean-shaven, with soap made from fat and wood\nashes. \"The others must come here, Paul. I suppose Chris won't consent\ntill Pakriaa agrees--damn, you'd think she could see it. She knows her\nenemies fear the ocean as she does. Lantis' two-by-four army would\nnever chase after us in their lake boats.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute, Jocko. Lantis is no two-by-four proposition.\"\n\n\"Damn pint-size Napoleon with four teats and a grass skirt.\"\n\n\"Lookee: that settlement south of Lake Argo is thirty miles long.\nEquivalent of two hundred villages, to Pakriaa's six. Say twenty\nthousand warriors who got their pride hurt a year ago when the crash\nof _Argo_ swamped their fleet and scared the pants off 'em. They'll\nhave replaced the fleet. They'll come overland too. Lantis, Queen of\nthe World.\"\n\n\"If they do\"--Sears' heavy voice had the tremor that he himself\nhated--\"the firearms should be at least one ace in the hole.\"\n\n\"Ye--es. Ed's pistol helped in our one bad scrape with Pakriaa\nherself. But it was his smashing the idol that stalled 'em, not the\ngun.\"\n\n\"Poor little Abro Pakriaa!\" Sears spoke with tenderness. \"If ever a\nlady was pulled seven ways from Sunday! Wants our way of life, doesn't\nwant it. Wants to grasp Chris' ethics, doesn't want to. Afraid of Ed's\nstrength and aggressiveness, admires 'em too, oh my, yes. Tries to\nbelieve the god Ismar died or never lived--but can't, quite.\"\n\n\"And can't understand why our women are gentle--Dorothy anyway----\"\n\n\"Nan's toughening up is conscious effort, Paul. Superficial. She's\nmade herself hunt, shoot well, act hard, because her brain tells her\nshe should. If we could only find something to restring her violin! I\nthink she's given up hope of it: nothing I've found so far has been\nany good. She doesn't see that Dorothy does more for us by remaining\nthe person she always was.... You know, when I go alone to Pak's\nvillage, I just set. Even the witches have got used to me, not that\nthey wouldn't gut me if they could.\"\n\n\"Jocko\"--Paul looked away--\"you told me once you were scared all the\ntime. When you go there alone--or when you tame the olifants for that\nmatter--are you sort of grasping the nettle? And does it work?\"\n\n\"Don't ask me, friend. Because I don't exactly know. I was never a\nbrave man.\" Brown eyes misted in what was partly laughter. \"Oy, the\nwitches! There's the big enemy in the battle for Pakriaa's mind. Chris\nmay claim they aren't real witch doctors, just advisers, low-grade\nmagicians. I'm not so sure. Priests of Ismar, and when Ed clobbered\nthe idol Pakriaa did consider having 'em all burned alive. Point is,\nshe didn't do it. They gnaw away in the dark at all we try to teach\nher. That proposed bonfire, by the way, is gossip passed on to me in\nconfidence by Abara.\"\n\n\"There's a dear little man.\"\n\n\"Ain't he though?\" Smiling into late sky, Paul envisaged the wizened\nred midget riding the white monsters that Sears had tamed and insisted\non naming olifants-with-an-f. A painting might grow out of that, he\nthought, squat coppery lump astride of massive white--it might, if the\ndesire to paint should ever wake again and be as strong as it once was\non _Argo_, when his mind's eye could remember Earth without\ndistortion. Abara, popeyed and potbellied, a favorite in Pakriaa's\nharem, had been commissioned by her as a student and go-between at the\nlakeside camp; Sears had not only adopted him as an olifant trainer,\nbut suspected him of furtively possessing a sense of humor. \"Well--the\ngiants. Lantis will always have thought of them as wild animals----\"\n\n\"Sears\"--Paul rolled over and pressed his face in the grass--\"can we\nask or even permit the giants to tangle in a pygmy war?\"\n\n\"Ah.... It's tormenting Chris too, ever since Lantis sent that\nultimatum.\" He snarled in his beard, \"Thirty fat meat slaves every two\nmonths! There's politics for you. Dirtiest way she could answer Pak's\nchallenge to personal combat, and the automatic refusal makes an\nexcuse to come and clean up. Sounds like home.... Mijok wants to help\nfight--says he does.\"\n\n\"It's still our responsibility.\" Paul sat up. His eyes kept returning\nto the towering courage of the trees. Brave as any cathedral spire,\nscarcely one was free from the clutch of the purple-leaf vine. \"As\nfor moving here to the island, Pak sees it, but the idea's too new.\nYou just don't pull up stakes, venture on the Big Water, crossing\nforbidden kaksma country.\"\n\nSears chewed a grass blade. \"Anyway we've got to bring Dorothy and the\nbaby here, and Ann. Dorothy won't fuss, will she, son?\"\n\n\"Since there _is_ Helen--no, she won't. I still dream sometimes, as I\ndid during her first pregnancy. Things, shapes, trying to pull her\naway--or she's where I can't find her, can't push through the leaves.\"\n\n\"She told me. It's something else that's made you blue lately.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nSears watched him. \"Yes.... Want to start back tomorrow?\"\n\n\"Might as well. We've learned all we need.\"\n\n\"Mm.... Second thoughts about the daddy of Dorothy's second----\"\n\n\"No no. We settled that. She's proud to be carrying it.\"\n\n\"Good genetics could be damn bad psychology.\"\n\n\"No, Jocko. Don't think that. She's close to me as ever.\"\n\nSears waited and spoke softly: \"New York late on a rainy night, a few\ncar lights moving, street-lamp reflections like golden fish----\"\n\n\"Orange paintbrush in New Hampshire meadows----We'd better stop.\"\n\n\"We better. I want boat whistles--floating city coming out of the fog.\nCall it a slow-healing wound.... And look across the channel.\"\n\nPaul saw it presently: a cliff formation in the coastal range made a\nbrow, nose, and chin. Below this, rounded rock could be a shoulder\nstraining in heroic effort; then, tumbled reality of mountain-fancy\nmust supply whatever held the figure in bondage. \"Yes. He looks west.\nPast us, at the sun.\"\n\n\"Why, no, Paul. I think he looks west of the sun....\"\n\nA red-furred girl wandered down from the woods. \"I got tired.\" Arek\nhad lived twenty-two years; she was seven feet tall, not yet\nadolescent but near it. In the next Red-Moon-before-the-Rains, ten\nmonths away, she might take adult part in the frenzy of love if her\nbody demanded it: if not, she would go apart with the other children,\nwhose play also became innocently erotic at that time, and help care\nfor the youngest. Sears grinned as she sat down with them. \"Tired or\nlazy?\"\n\n\"Both. You Charins are never lazy enough.\" The name Charin, Paul\nthought, was almost natural now, a pygmy word for \"halfway,\" intended\nby Pakriaa merely to convey that Wright and his breed were halfway in\nsize between her people and the giants, but Wright took sardonic\nsatisfaction in it as a generic name. \"Work and loafing are both good.\nWhy can Ed Spearman never sit still in the sun? Or maybe I like to\ntalk too much.\"\n\n\"Never,\" Sears chuckled. \"Well--his best pleasure is in action. Maybe\nit's the technician in him--he must always be doing something.\"\n\n\"Like always waking, never sleeping.\" She sprawled in comfort; her\nbroad hands plucked grass, scattered it over the furry softness of her\nfour breasts. \"Green rain.... I want to stay on this island. Will they\ncome?\"\n\n\"We hope so. Mijok will as soon as Doc does.\"\n\nShe sighed. \"Mijok is a beautiful male. I think I'll take him for my\nfirst when I'm ready.... And soon the pretty boat will be no more\ngood. It's sad we can't make another. Tell me again about Captain\nJensen. He was as tall as me? He had hair on his head, red like my\nfur. He spoke----\"\n\n\"Like storm wind,\" said Paul, supplying the wanted note in a favorite\nfairy tale, remembering a brother on Earth who was--perhaps--not dead.\n\n\"Hear the ocean,\" Arek whispered. Paul could hardly separate the sound\nfrom the mutter of the pond's outlet. This ridge of high ground ended\nshort of the island's northern limit. A white beach, where the\nlifeboat was shaded from late sun, faced the mainland. West of the\nbeach a red stone cliff ran to the tip of the island, shouldering away\nthe sea. Wind out of the west allowed no soil to gather on it. Now and\nthen a rainbow flashed and died above the rock, when a wave of\nuncommon grandeur spent itself in a tower of foam. \"Hear what it says?\n'I--will--try--aga-a-ain....' Why must the others wait to come here?\"\n\n\"Pakriaa's people are not ready.\"\n\n\"Oh, Sears!\" Arek laughed unhappily and sat up. \"I think of how my\nmother taught me the three terrors. She took me to the hills, beat two\nstones before a burrow till one blundered out maddened, afraid of\nnothing but the light. She crushed it, made me smell it. I was sick;\nthen we fled. I think of how she flung an _asonis_ carcass into meadow\ngrass, so the omasha came. She wounded one with a stone, made me watch\nwhile the others tore it apart. Later still, when I could run\nfast--ah, through night to a village of the Red Bald----\"\n\n\"Please, dear--pygmies. That's a name they accept.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Sears.... Yes, we hid in the dark, waited until a sentry\nmoved--careless.... It was wrong. You've shown us how such things are\nwrong. And memory's someone talking behind you, out of the big dark.\"\n\n\"The laws we've agreed on----\"\n\n\"I do honor them,\" she said gently. \"The law against murder was my\nfirst writing lesson. But--what if Pakriaa's tribe--\"\n\n\"They're slower,\" Sears said in distress, and the distress would be as\nmuch a message to Arek as any words. There was no hiding the heart\nfrom these people: green eyes and black ears missed no smallest\nnuance.\n\n\"When will they know they must not dig pits, with poisoned stakes--\"\n\n\"But Pakriaa's tribe don't do that now. Do they?\"\n\nArek admitted: \"I suppose not. But the six other villages----\"\n\n\"Five, dear. The kaksmas. And only two months ago, Arek.\"\n\nShe stared at Paul with shock. \"I _had_ almost forgotten. But they do\nstill hate us. The day before you flew us here, Paul, I met Pakriaa\nand two of her soldiers in the woods. I gave them the good-day\ngreeting. Oh, if one of you had been there she would have answered\nit.... Wouldn't the island be better without them? Some of _you_ don't\nlike them. Even Dorothy only tries to like them. Since the baby was\nborn, Paul, she--shrinks when they come to the fortress. They don't\nknow it, but I do.\"\n\nDimly, Paul had known it, known also that it was a thing Dorothy would\nconsciously reject. \"Time, Arek. You'll live a hundred and fifty\nyears or better--more than three pygmy lifetimes. You'll see them\nchange.\"\n\nSpeaking almost like a Charin, Arek said, \"They'd better.\"\n\nThey strolled up the hill; the other giants' labor had ceased. The\nbuilding was a sturdy oblong, intended as storehouse and temporary\ncommunal dwelling for them all, including (Wright hoped) some of\nPakriaa's people. Rafters were not yet in place. For that, Rak needed\nthe strength of another like himself: chubby Muson tired easily.\nSomeday a road would climb from the beach, traversing the ridge which\nwas the backbone of the northern half of the island. Here, where\nspring water filled the pond and rushed on down to carve a small\nharbor below the beach, would be Jensen City, and the three races of\nLucifer would learn to live there in good will and pleasure under a\ngovernment of laws. So Wright said--peering at photographs, teasing\nhis gray beard, tapping thin fingers on the map drawn on the paper of\nEarth, on the new maps of whitebark. Paul could see it too--sometimes;\nglimpse the houses, gardens, open places. South of the pond, a wheat\nfield, for on Lucifer the wheat of Earth grew to four feet and bore\nrichly. Near the field, perhaps the house for Dorothy and himself,\nwith no doorway lower than ten feet.\n\nAt other times he could see only defeat--the arrogance and blind drive of\ngenus _Charin_, species _Semisapiens_ beating against the indifference of\nnature, the resentment of other life. He could see his people destroyed, by\naccident or anger, the giant friends adrift with only hints of the new life\nand spoiled for the old. Then he would stop trying to foresee and would\nmake his mind's ear listen to Wright insisting: \"_Give protoplasm a chance.\nPatience is the well-spring._...\"\n\nThe walls were eleven feet in height. Rak and Muson rested on the\ncoolness of bare ground within; Rak pointed at the top of the walls\nwhere rafters would rest. \"Slow,\" he said, \"and good.\" Rak could not\nbe sure how old he was. When Mijok had first persuaded him to the camp\nten months ago, Rak had won his English with the grave precision of a\nmason selecting fieldstone. His language had none of the flexibility\nand scope that Mijok and others had achieved, but it served him.\nAfter absorbing basic arithmetic, Rak had deliberated on the problem\nof his age--squatting at the gate of the stone fortress by Lake Argo,\nspreading out rows of colored pebbles to indicate years, rainy\nseasons, episodes of hunting or fear or passion too keen to forget. At\nlast he had come up with the figure of 130 years. \"But,\" he said,\n\"there are two times. In here\"--he patted an ancient scar on his\nbelly--\"and there.\" He pointed at the red crescent moon.\n\n\"I'll cook supper,\" Arek said. Muson bubbled and shadowboxed with her\ndaughter. Muson would laugh at anything--the flutter of a leaf, a\nbreath of breeze on her red-brown fur. Paul followed to help Arek trim\nthe carcass of an asonis killed the night before. Hornless,\nshort-legged, fat, the bovine animal was abundant on the island; its\none enemy here was what Arek called _usran_, a catlike carnivore the\nsize of a lynx, which could tackle only the young asonis or feeble\nstragglers. Rak hunted in the old way. Bow, club, spear, even rifle,\nhad been explained to him, but the stalk, the single rush and leap,\nthe grasp of a muzzle and backward jerk that snapped the neck before\nthe prey could even struggle--these were Rak's way still. In the old\nlife, Rak's age would have led him eventually to a few dim years with\na band of women, who would have fed him until he chose to wander into\ndeep jungle, preventing any from following. When far away, he would\nhave sat in the shadows to wait--for starvation or the black marsh\nreptiles or a great mainland cat, _uskaran_, which never attacked a\ngiant in the prime of strength. Rak would have taken no harm from the\nyoung men in this weakness: his own territory would have been\ninviolate, and he would have joined the women, in a taciturn farewell\nto life, only when teeth and arms had failed. (\"We're gentle people,\"\nMijok said, puzzled at it himself. \"In the Red-Moon-before-the-Rains\nwe only play at fighting. It's not like what we see the other\ncreatures do at that time. How could one 'possess' a woman? Do I\npossess the wind because I like to run against the touch of it...?\")\n\nThe meat hung from a makeshift tripod; Arek jumped back, startled, as\na furry thing scampered down. It was like a kinkajou except for the\nhump on the back (a true hindbrain in the spine: Sears had long ago\nverified that guess of Wright's). \"Little rascal,\" Paul said. \"Let's\ntame it.\"\n\n\"What?\" Arek was bewildered. \"Do what?\"\n\n\"Do these live on the mainland?\"\n\n\"I never saw one till I came here. Too small to eat. Tame it?\"\n\n\"Watch.\" Paul tossed a bit of meat. The visitor's chatter changed to a\nwhistling whine; it elongated itself, grabbed, sat back on stubby hind\nlegs to eat in clever paws; it washed itself with a squirrel's\npertness. Arek chuckled, examining the idea, and went on with her\nwork; she had become a hypercritical cook, under Dorothy's guidance.\n\"Jocko, biologist, stand by: I propose to name an animile. Genus\n_Kink_, species _quasikinkajou_.\" Genus Kink did not retreat at Sears'\nquiet approach, but wriggled a black nose.\n\nRak asked in solemn curiosity, \"For what is it good?\"\n\n\"To make us laugh,\" Paul said, \"so long as we're kind to it.\"\n\n\"Ah?\" Rak moved his fingers to aid the patient mill of his mind.\n\n\"Dance-Nose,\" said Muson, who already understood. She shook all over.\n\"Come, Funny-Nose.\" It would not--yet, but Muson could be patient too.\n\nSears whispered in his beard, \"Less homesick?\"\n\n\"Yes....\"\n\nAfter the meal Arek wanted Paul to come out on the cliffs. Though\nthere seemed no danger from the omasha, she carried a long stick and\nPaul took his pistol. The slope leveled out to the bare rock of the\nheadland; the ocean voice was the humming of a thousand giants. The\nway was easy, with no crevasses, no peril while the wind was mild.\nArek had often been out here alone. Yesterday Paul had seen her\nstanding for an hour, watching the west where unbroken water met a\nsun-reddened horizon. In her earlier years there might have been dim\nmention of the sea by her almost wordless people, but no true\nknowledge: the mainland coast was steaming vine-choked jungle, or\ntidal marsh, and shut away by the kaksma hills. Paul wondered what\nmember of his race could stand for an hour in contemplation like a\nthinking tree, not shifting a foot nor raising an arm...?\n\n\"Paul, why did you leave Earth?\" Arek patted the rock beside her.\n\nBelow the troubled water laughed, endlessly defeated and returning.\nCloud fantasies gathered below a lucid green, and the wind was a\nfriend. \"I have doubted sometimes whether we ought to have done so.\"\n\n\"That wasn't my meaning. We love you. Didn't you know? But I've\nwondered what sent you away from such a place. Ann says it was\nbeautiful.\"\n\n\"A--drive of restlessness. We took boundaries as a challenge. I used\nto think that a great virtue. Now I call it neither good nor evil.\"\n\n\"I think it is good.\"\n\n\"Everywhere, we carry good _and_ evil.\"\n\n\"What you do here is good. You teach us. You do kind things.\"\n\n\"We can be bad. But for Doc Wright and his dreams that Ed Spearman\nfinds so impractical, we'd have done you harm.\" Helpless at her\ninnocence, Paul saw she did not believe him. \"On Earth, we fought each\nother. We hunted for lies to make ourselves feel big. We created great\ninstitutions built on vanity--tickling lies: imperialism,\ncommunism--most of the isms you find so puzzling when we talk of Earth\nhistory. The anger of Charins rarely focused itself on the actual\ncauses of unhappiness or injustice. Instead we hunted for scapegoats,\neasy solutions. We wouldn't study ourselves. Always we itched for\nsomething external to take the blame for our own follies and crimes.\"\n\n\"I don't understand.\"\n\n\"As if you stumbled on a root, Arek, and then banged your fist on the\ntree that grew it, to blame it for your own clumsiness.\"\n\n\"But Paul--only a very small child would act like that.\"\n\n\"Darling, let's watch the sunset.\" She felt his pain, touched his\nknee, and was silent until he said, \"A poor naughty child....\"\n\n\"There was a thing Ed Spearman said to me--what I wanted to talk to\nyou about. I've never gone to Pakriaa's village. You know, even Mijok\nwon't go there except with one of you. I asked Ed if Pakriaa still\nkept that stockade for drugging and fattening prisoners--in spite of\nher agreeing to the laws. He said yes, she did. I said it was not\nright. I said we made a law against slavery too. He said, 'Forget it,\nbaby--one thing at a time.' I am not a baby. How can the laws govern\nus unless all obey them?\"\n\n\"Ed--meant no harm, Arek. He only meant it does take time. The pygmies\nhave more to unlearn. You--started clean. And--well--with the army of\nLantis likely to come back at any time--we can't afford--\"\n\nYet it seemed natural that this giant child, who had herself done\nmurder in the old days, should answer his troubled evasions not only\nwith reproach but with command: \"If the laws are to govern us they\nmust be respected by everyone. I wish I had gone to that village and\ntorn down the stockade with my hands.\"\n\n\"And they would have killed you with a hundred spears and Pakriaa's\npeople would hate us forever, learning nothing but more hatred.\"\n\nArek cried a little, rubbing at the unfamiliar wetness. \"Maybe I begin\nto see, how difficult.... The sun's going.\" But they sat quietly in\nthe warm and undemanding wind until the first sapphire glint of\nfireflies dotted the slope where Jensen City might one day shine. Arek\nstood, reaching down an affectionate hand.\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nPaul glanced down at sunrise-tinted snow on the highest peak of the\ncoastal range, thirteen thousand feet above the sea. Prairie spread\nfor thirty miles east of its base; then came a region of forest and\nsmall lakes fed by the outlet of Lake Argo, which was the core of the\nempire of Lantis, Queen of the World.\n\nPakriaa's information on Lantis was a murky blend of truth and\nfantasy. Lantis claimed birth from Ismar-Creator-and-Destroyer.\nPakriaa had different theories. Originally ruler of a single village,\nLantis consolidated by conquest. Instead of annihilating defeated\nvillages she took their populations captive, sorting out three\ncategories: potential followers, slave laborers, and meat. Many in the\nfirst class became fanatically converted; those in the second provided\na year or so of work before dying of whippings and other abuse;\ncaptives of the third class were forced to eat the green-flowered weed\nthat numbed the brain and were bled out at the right stage of fatness.\nIn fifteen years one riverside village had swollen to a city of sixty\nthousand, fed by expeditions far to the east, and Lantis named her\ncity Vestoia--Country of Freedom and Joy. \"Got anything new in the\n'scope?\"\n\nSears groaned: \"There _are_ more boats above the falls.\"\n\nThe boats, they knew, were broad canoes roofed like sampans against\nthe omasha, but with no sail. \"Not moving, are they?\"\n\n\"No--anchored maybe.\" Sears mopped his round face.\n\nWithout the telescope, Paul could see brownness on the water of Lake\nArgo's southern end, near the spot where the outlet tumbled over a\nhigh falls to a smaller lake. It meant that hundreds more must have\nbeen portaged past the falls from Vestoia during his two days on the\nisland....\n\nThe fifty red-green flowing miles became a pain of delay. Sears too\nwould be aching for the gray square of their \"fortress\" to claim the\neye in the north, touched by early sunlight, a brave structure twelve\nfeet high, fifty square, built of split stone by the labor of giant\nfriends. Outside it ran a moat twenty feet wide, ten deep, with a\ndrawbridge of logs, bark matting, grass-fiber ropes, the bottom\nflooded with lake water. There was room within for living quarters, a\nsupply of smoked meat, dried vegetables.\n\nLantis understood scaling ladders, Pakriaa said. Lantis had patience\nfor a siege. There was no defense, Pakriaa said, in these measures.\nThe only defense was to attack, to retreat, and attack again. It had\nalways been so in the old wars. It was still so with this Lantis and\nher Big-Village-Vestoia, this bastard begotten of a red worm and\nInkar, goddess of kaksmas. It would always be so--at least, until....\nPaul remembered Dorothy, cherishing Helen at her brown breast, asking\nneutrally, \"Until what, Abro Pakriaa?\"\n\nPakriaa had studied the giants' walls with contempt. \"Until I shame\nthis worm spawn Lantis into meeting me alone. She must respect custom.\nHer first answer is a--what word?--rejection, because she has fear. I\nhave sent a second challenge. She will meet me, or her own people will\ncondemn her. I will pin her belly to the ground. Her government will\nbe mine.\" There had been no mistaking it: for the first time in the\nyear since the idol of Ismar fell and was not restored, Pakriaa was\nmaking vast decisions wholly her own, with only perfunctory interest\nin what the Charins might think. In her wrath against the mighty\nsoldier ruler in the south there was natural grief at the outrages of\npast years, but something else too. Her red face glaring southward\nsaid: _She has what I desire; she is doing what I would do_. Pakriaa\nhad finished her answer quietly: \"It is _I_ who will be Queen of the\nWorld.\"\n\nThree days ago. It could have been a mistake to leave the camp at all.\nNow--a streak of sunshine on gray at the end of familiar meadow. With\nfuel for only a few more flights, Paul knew he had never made a better\nlanding. The drawbridge was down. Dorothy ran to meet him. Sears was\nshouting, \"Chris! It's perfect--no kaksmas--everything Paul said it\nwas--\"\n\nPaul stammered, \"You look like a million dollars.\"\n\n\"Dollars. What're those?\"\n\n\"I forget. What's news?\"\n\n\"Your funny mouth is tickling my ear.\"\n\n\"That isn't news, Dope. Helen--\"\n\n\"Full of the best gurgles. Come and see.\" He thought: _How do I tell\nher of the boats, the thirty-mile hive of savage hatreds_--but Sears\nwas already talking of it. Wright had no smile for Paul, only a warm\ngray-eyed stare and pressure of the hand. Paul asked, \"Where's Ed?\nMijok and the boys?\"\n\nAnn looked up from cutting a square of hide. She had not come to meet\nthem. Ann's way nowadays; one's mind insisted: _It doesn't mean\nanything_. \"Ed's hunting. Should have been back last night.\"\n\nDorothy added: \"Mijok's off missionarying, with Elis and Surok. They\ntook Blondie--Lisson, I mean: moral support.\"\n\nWright was hag-ridden. \"Sears, if it were only Pakriaa's\ntribe--but--not fuel enough to fly all the giants over. We cannot\nabandon _them_.\"\n\n\"Then let's get the women there and the rest of us go overland.\"\n\nAnn said, \"I'm going overland.\"\n\nWright muttered, \"Damn it, Nancy--\"\n\nSears patted her shoulder and ignored her speech as she ignored the\ntouch. \"Chris, I've labored, myself, over that damn knotty little\nbrain of Pakriaa's. She can't see things our way. We need a hundred\nyears.\"\n\nThe conference lengthened into the morning. Sometimes it seemed to\nPaul that his teacher's stubbornness degenerated into the obsession of\na man who won't leave a blazing house until the rugs are saved. Wright\nlonged for the island, which he had seen only in photographs. There\nhad always been some compelling reason why he must stay by the\nfortress, if only to hoe voracious weeds out of the gardens. Yet to\nWright it was unthinkable that the island community should start\nwithout the pygmies: he returned to it with haggard insistence. \"I\nknow--I can't actually like Pakriaa--she's got a mind like a greased\neel; but we've made a beginning. They speak our tongue--well. A people\nintelligent as they are--\"\n\nPaul thought: _It's not Lucifer that's aged him--it's us. We are not\nbig enough_. Aloud he suggested: \"Doc, can't we make a start without\nthem and just keep the door open? Bring them in when we're stronger\nourselves?\"\n\n\"Oh, son, if we desert Pak now, she's finished. Over-confidence.\nLantis will go over her like a tide. We might just turn that tide. If\nnot, we _must_ be ready to help her escape with--whatever's left....\nWell, at least we agree on this: Helen and the women must go to the\nisland, at once.\"\n\n\"Tomorrow.\" Dorothy choked. \"If the boats haven't started yet--\"\n\n\"All right, dear. Tomorrow. And one man should go with them.\"\n\n\"You,\" Paul said. \"You.\"\n\nWright said inexorably, \"No.\" His stare groped at Sears Oliphant.\n\nSears was nakedly desperate. \"Chris, I beg of you--you must not ask me\nto go away from this battle.\" He was sweating, white. \"I am--in a\nsense--a religious man. The--Armageddon within, your own\nphrase--please understand without my saying any more. Don't ask me to\ngo.\"\n\n\"Ed won't go.... Paul?\"\n\n_Leave him, with Sears' inner torments and Ed's arrogance?_ \"No, Doc.\"\n\nAnn Bryan said, \"I'm staying for the show.\"\n\nDorothy lowered her cheek to the brown fuzz of Helen's head; the\nbaby's absurd square of palm found Paul's finger. Helen was almost\neight months old--Lucifer months. The new life in Dorothy had been\nconceived in the last month of the rains. Dorothy said, \"I'm going,\nNancy, with Helen. As a valuable brood mare, I can't afford heroism.\nNeither can you.\"\n\nThe giant women crossed the bridge; they had lingered outside, knowing\nthe Charins needed to talk alone. Ann said, \"I've heard the argument.\nI'm not pregnant yet. I've learned to shoot damn' well.\"\n\nWright asked, \"Will you abide by a vote when Ed gets back?\"\n\nAnn pushed her fingers into black hair, cut short as a man's. \"I\nsuppose I must.... If no men get to the island, how do two women and a\ngirl child increase and multiply, or shouldn't I ask?\"\n\nWright mumbled inadequately, \"We'll reach the island.\"\n\nAnn said, \"Then you already see it as a retreat?\"\n\nWright was silent. He tried to smile with confidence at the giant\nwomen and children, who were sober with reflected unhappiness--all but\nnine-year-old Dunin, who trotted to Paul and hugged him with her large\narms and announced: \"I learned six words while you were gone. Hi,\nlisten! 'Brain': that's here and here. 'Me-di-tation': that happens in\nthe brain when it's quiet. Mm-mm.... 'Breast': that's these. And\n'breath': that's ooph, like that. 'Breeze': that's a breath with\nnobody blowing it.... I forgotten six.\"\n\nDorothy murmured. \"Tem--tem--\"\n\nDunin hopped up and down. \"'Tempest!' Big _big_ breeze--\"\n\n\"That's perfect,\" said Paul. \"Perfect....\"\n\nBefore the five-month rainy season had made travel on the sodden,\ngasping ground too miserable, Mijok had explored a half circle of\nterritory forty miles in radius east of the hills, for others who\nmight be willing to learn new ways. It was slow work, often\ndiscouraging. He had located two bands of free-wandering women and\nchildren--twenty in all--and stirred their curiosity and friendliness.\nBut he had been able to recruit only three other males. There was Rak.\nBlackfurred Elis and tawny Surok were in vigorous middle years, hard\nto convince but quick to learn once the barrier was down.\n\nKamon was accepted leader of the women. White with age, gaunt,\nflat-breasted, stooped but quick on her feet, Kamon rarely smiled, but\nher good nature was profound. \"Ann,\" she said, \"you ought to go.\nWe--if we cannot fight off these southern pygmies, we can escape. But\nyou? One of us would have to carry you. And as Mashana Dorothy says,\nyour womb is needed.\" (Mashana--sweetheart, mother, hunting companion,\nfriend.)\n\nWright said, \"You, Dorothy, Helen, and the giant children.\"\n\nThat brought murmuring. Kamon checked it: \"Only four children still\nneed milk. You, Samis, your breasts are big: you will go.\" Kamon\nturned with gentle deference to one authority she felt to be stronger\nthan her own under the laws: \"Doc?\" Paul found it comfortable, no\nlonger even amusing, that Wright should be known to the giants by his\ninevitable nickname. The pygmies disliked the short sound, and initial\n_D_ always bothered them. To them he was Tocwright, or more often\nTocwright-Who-Plays-with Gray-Fur-at-His-Throat.\n\n\"Yes, Kamon. Samis too. Paul, how many trips will that take?\"\n\n\"Three--leaving fuel for about three more of the same length.\"\n\nWright nodded. \"Ed has a notion of using the lifeboat for a weapon.\nHedgehop, scare 'em to hell. But with fuel so low--\"\n\nThere was shadow at the drawbridge. Ed Spearman flung aside the\ncarcass he had brought. Ann's white face was still, though she clung\nto him briefly when he kissed her. It had occurred to Paul that Ann's\nimage of love would not be given reality anywhere in the galaxies: she\nwished moments to be eternities and a human self to be a mirror of\ndesire. _But Dorothy and I--somehow we've learned to let each other\nlive...._ \"More news,\" Spearman said. \"I stopped at the village. A spy\nof Pakriaa's came home last night--must be a sharp article: did the\nsixty-odd miles up the lake shore in nothing flat, with facts and\nfigures.\"\n\n\"Lantis is moving.\" Wright dropped his hands to his bony knees.\n\n\"No, Doc, but will in a day or so.\" Spearman sat down, holding Ann's\nfingers till she pulled them away. He nodded to Sears and Paul. \"Good\ntrip?\" He had grown even more rugged in a year of Lucifer. He wore\nonly shorts and Earth-made shoes; months of handling a heavy bow had\nmade his upper arms almost as thick as the narrow part of Mijok's\nforearm. His face had deepened its lines; he had never smiled easily.\n\n\"Very good,\" Sears said. \"The island is--\" He was silent.\n\nSpearman grunted. \"You're sold too? Well, here's the news. One: you\nremember Pakriaa's second challenge, sent by two warriors, correct and\nformal--trust Pak for that. One of those messengers is returning. The\nspy ran on ahead--with part of the body of the other ambassador.\" He\nstudied the sickened faces. \"Two: the spy says Lantis plans to send\nfour thousand on the lake boats, another six thousand overland.\nPakriaa--who is in a state of mind I don't know how to describe, not\njitters exactly--Pakriaa thinks we may feel the lake-boat drums\ntomorrow. She doesn't know what they are, by the way--invention of\nLantis, I guess. From her description they must be drums, maybe hollow\nlogs mounted on boats. She heard them last year in the war we\ninterrupted. You feel them before you hear them, she says: she thinks\nit was a lake devil consulting with the Queen of the World. Three: the\nspy wasn't sure, but thinks Lantis has already sent six hundred east\nof the lake to make a big circle, come down on the settlement from the\nnortheast.\"\n\n\"Smart,\" Paul said. \"To drive us into the kaksma hills?\"\n\n\"The kaksma hills.\" Spearman's gray eyes squinted in a sort of\nlaughter. \"They're not so bad. The critters may be all they say, after\ndark, but--I'd better own up: I've gone that way on my last three solo\ntrips. Safe enough in daylight, when they're half blind. I killed a\nfew today.\"\n\nSears asked quickly, \"Bring back specimens?\"\n\nSpearman teased the fat man with waiting and chuckled and nodded at\nthe asonis carcass. \"Tied to one of the hoofs. Don't look so worried,\nDoc--I waded plenty of streams on the way back.\" He rose with heavy\ngrace and strolled out on the bridge. \"Come a minute, some of you.\"\nPaul joined him; Wright stayed as he was; Sears was examining the\nkaksma's gray, thick-tailed body, holding back its pinkish lip. Paul\ncaught a repellent glimpse of the jutting upper canines; the molars\nwere shearing tools like a cat's. He saw the spade claws of the\nforefeet. The jet eyes were like a mole's. \"Look,\" Spearman said, \"the\nhills. Notice that hogback at the southern end--it's five miles long.\nRiddled with burrows. They must live on small game on the meadow below\nand hunt the other side of the hills too, where it's jungle.\" His\nfingers dug at Paul's shoulder. He spoke loudly enough to be heard by\nall: \"Listen: the earth at the burrows is red ocher. Understand?\nHematite.\"\n\nWright let out his breath sharply. \"So--\"\n\n\"Yeah. Just a five-mile mountain of iron ore. Merely what I've been\nlooking for ever since we crashed. For a start. From iron to steel\nto--ah.... And just when we've _got_ it--God! with organized pygmy\nlabor--\" He strode back into the fortress, glancing obliquely at the\nsilent giant women. \"The pygmies do understand work, you know. Well,\nnever mind it now. Of course we must get the baby and the women to\nyour island right away. As a temporary refuge, we must use it.\" He\nwatched Wright with unqualified sadness. \"Apart from that, you know\nwhat I think of your Island of Lotos-Eaters--\"\n\n\"That's not just, Ed.\"\n\n\"Adelphi then. Well, the women and Helen--\"\n\n\"And the giant children, with Samis to nurse the youngest.\"\n\nSpearman asked evenly, \"Paul, how's the charlesite?\"\n\n\"After the trips Doc mentioned, enough for three more.\"\n\nAnn's keen ears caught a far-off sound. \"Mijok's coming back.\"\n\nThe music grew slowly manifest: Mijok, in an Earth song more than two\nhundred years old. Long-flowing chanteys and slower spirituals suited\nhim. He had teased Ann to teach him all she knew, even after she lost\ninterest. Swift melodies and rapid syllables were beyond him--the\ndepth of his tone rendered them grotesque. More than a mile away, he\nwas wallowing in \"Shenandoah\"--Mijok, to whom the ocean was only a\nword and a river steamboat the cloudiest of legends. Other voices,\ntrue on pitch, followed his solo:\n\n\"_Away--we're bound away...._\"\n\nPaul asked, \"How many, Nan?\"\n\nAnn shut her eyes. \"Four, besides Mijok and--yes, Lisson's singing. At\nleast two new recruits. Ah--they can sing before they talk.\" She\nhurried into that thatched house-within-a-house which was her comer of\nprivacy on Lucifer. The giant women were smiling, though Kamon's eyes\nfollowed Ann with trouble and pity. They hummed in three-part\ncounterpoint. Their voices had the range of a Charin baritone; Paul\nmissed Muson, who could approach the tenor. Sears' bass moved in, a\nwell-behaved trombone teasing a crowd of bassoons. Dorothy's alto\nadded a warm thread of sound....\n\nThe tall children and women poured out over the bridge when Mijok and\nhis companions were still distant. Musical thunder in the woods pulsed\nalong the ground. Spearman smiled indulgently. \"Just like a bunch of\nkids.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Wright said. \"The pygmies are more serious. They have wars.\"\n\nSears stopped humming and mumbled, \"Don't, Chris....\"\n\nMijok brought in his triumph, beaming and warm. \"And my smallest\nwoman?\" Dorothy placed the naked morsel that was Helen in his waiting\nhands. Mijok was bemused. \"How can anything be so small?\"\n\nDorothy claimed: \"Seven pounds at birth--that ain't hay, Mijok.\"\n\n\"Growing too,\" Elis said. The golden-furred girl Lisson tickled\nHelen's chest with the tip of a forefinger, and Mijok introduced the\nnewcomers. One was timid. \"Just a boy,\" Mijok explained. \"Knows some\nwords already, though. Danik?\"\n\nThe giant boy whispered, \"Good day.\" The other was older, black like\nElis, trying to display stern indifference, but Surok eased him into\nrelaxation with a few words in the old language.\n\nFor Mijok, speech had still the brilliance of newness but was wholly\nflexible; he reveled in colloquialisms, acquired mainly from Sears and\nDorothy. \"While the boys and I were out having a hell of a time,\nwhat's with local industries? The island, gentlemen?\"\n\n\"Good,\" Sears said. \"Better than I dared dream.\"\n\n\"And those tough babies in the south--anything new?\"\n\nSears winced. \"That part ain't good.\"\n\nMijok fondled the fat man's arm with a hand mild as silk. \"Now, Jock,\nnow. We'll give 'em hell, that's what we'll do. Hey, Paul?\"\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nAbara trotted between Sears and Paul in the forest aisle, a silent\nugly man with popeyes, bulging underlip, jutting ears; thirty inches\ntall. He was twenty-six. His potbellied softness had the beginning sag\nof middle age. There was politics, Paul guessed, in his presence at\nthe camp--it was not because the queen had tired of him that he was\ntemporarily detached from the harem. His body was agile for all its\npokiness, his mind even more nimble; his English, when he stooped to\nuse it, was good. After the noon meal Abara had appeared, crossing the\ndrawbridge like a wisp of red smoke, ignoring the giants, reminding\nSears obliquely that it was three days since he had visited the\nclearing near the camp, where the white olifants had learned to come.\n\nSears' love for the great leaf eaters had deepened with familiarity.\nHe had easily persuaded the others to guarantee their permanent\nprotection in the laws. He had taught the pygmies to call them\nolifants, a shrewd stroke, conveying to the Neolithic mind that the\nanimals were of Sears' totem. Even during the long ordeal of the rains\nhe had gone alone for whole days and nights, following olifant trails,\nsitting in patience where a broad-leaf tree they enjoyed was abundant.\nDeep forest was no place for a man who moved slowly and shrank from\ndiscomfort and danger, yet Sears held to this undertaking as\nstubbornly as Wright to his dreams of a community of good will under a\ngovernment of laws. And before all except Paul and Wright, Sears was\nable to preserve a manner like the face of Lake Argo on a still\nmorning. That calm gave him, in the eyes of the pygmies, more puzzling\ndivinity than they found in the others. Abara worshiped from behind a\nmask of cynical blankness. Pakriaa seemed almost to love him openly.\nShe was not arrogant with him; when he spoke she listened. She\nassigned soldiers to collect the insects, fish, small animals he\nwanted for study; she brought him gifts--an earthenware vessel with\nritual painting, odd flowers, ornaments of wood and bone and clay. She\nliked to sit by him when he was at the microscope and peek, mystified,\ninto the country of the lens.\n\nSears had let the olifants grow used to him. He talked to them. He\nlearned they like to be rubbed above the tip of the trunk and on the\nvast flat tops of their heads--for this luxury they would kneel,\nrumbling and sighing. Eventually he dared climb into the natural\nsaddle between hump and skull: they allowed it. They were never\nexcited nor in a hurry. The kaksmas they probably avoided by keen\nscent and flight in times of danger; they kept clear of the omasha by\ngoing into open ground only at night.\n\nThe clearing was silent except for muted trilling of illuama. The\nground was trodden; purple-leaf vines hung dead and brown, ripped out\nby trunks and tusks. Sears said that once, with no notion of conveying\nthe idea, he had tugged peevishly at a vine under the nose of his\nfavorite cow. \"So, she came and fetched it loose--tired of watching me\nact like a damn fool.\"\n\nAbara said, \"I will whistle, me....\" Two came, spectrally calm.\n\"Susie!\" Sears called. \"Been a good girl, hey?\" The old cow let down\nher many tons to have her head scratched. Another arrived on\nfog-silent feet; then two bulls together, munching leaves. The five\nwere placid, enjoying the hot stillness and Sears' purring talk. The\nlargest bull stood ten feet at the shoulder, Paul estimated, as\nAbara's two-feet-six approached him, seized a lowered ear, and climbed\nup. Abara piped: \"We walk now, Mister Johnson.\"\n\nMister Johnson's pale eyes noted Paul's bulging jacket; the boneless\nfinger of his trunk groped suggestively till Paul produced a\nmelon-like fruit. \"Hoo-hee!\" Abara crowed. \"We thank you.\" They\nvanished in the shadows.\n\n\"Susie, want to dig some vines?\" But Sears halted in the act of\nclimbing her neck. Spearman had joined them, with a good hunter's\nquiet.\n\n\"You really have something there.\" Spearman was cordial and flushed.\n\"Pygmies still make the best wine. Ours is no damn good, yet.\"\n\n\"Meant to ask how the last turned out.\"\n\n\"Needs ripening, like everything else.\"\n\n\"In fact,\" said Paul, \"you're slightly plastered.\"\n\n\"But slightly.\" Ed grinned. \"How if I climb on one of those?\"\n\nSears was doubtful. \"Have to get acquainted first. Mister Smith over\nthere--he shook me off the first time. Not rough--just wasn't ready.\"\n\n\"They pull vines at command? You can steer 'em?\"\n\n\"Sure. If they like you. Knee pressure.\"\n\n\"Abara's good?\"\n\n\"They prefer him to me. Arek is better still. I miss her.\"\n\n\"Mijok rides, doesn't he?\"\n\n\"Mijok and Elis. Surok's a bit skittish. I guess Pak thinks it's\nundignified--or else the damned witches disapprove.\"\n\n\"Hm.... We have, maybe, three days before Lantis hits us--\"\n\n\"Lantis--I'd succeeded in forgetting her for three minutes.\" Sears\ndrooped his head against the column of Mister Smith's foreleg; eyes\nclosed, he cursed without humor. He dredged up almost forgotten words\nfrom the old years of Earth, from bars, docks, dissecting rooms, at\nleast four major religions. He cursed Lantis root and branch, ancestry\nand posterity, heart, body, and brain. Regaining a trace of mirth, he\noutlined a program of correction that would have kept hell under\nforced draft for a thousand years. Still with closed eyes, he asked,\n\"What's the point, Ed? What's the damned point?\"\n\n\"How many of these critters have you tamed?\"\n\n\"Five. There's another smelling around, not ready yet.\"\n\n\"And five riders--you ride 'em, don't you, Paul?\" Paul nodded.\n\nAbara and Mister Johnson returned in silence, under the trees behind\nSpearman, who was unaware of them. Sears said, \"Paul's good. Good\nbalance.\"\n\n\"So you have a rider for each mount.... Well, I talked it over with\nDoc--he says it's your department. What if a bunch of those animals,\nwith armed riders--\"\n\n\"No,\" said Sears. \"Quite impractical.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Well.... They won't go in the open--omasha.\"\n\n\"They will at night, you told me.\"\n\n\"They are not fighters.\"\n\n\"If they go where you order 'em--\"\n\nSears said, \"No. If Paul and I and the two strongest giants were\ntrying that, what's left? You, Doc, Surok, and the giant women.\"\n\nSpearman snapped: \"Then use only three--Abara, Mijok, Elis.\"\n\n\"Mijok will fight beside Chris. You know that. So will I.\"\n\nSpearman turned away, noticing Abara and Mister Johnson for the first\ntime and ignoring them. Popeyes watched him from a mountain of white\nflesh. \"All right. Oh, I almost forgot: Doc wants you back at the camp\nfor another conference. It has just occurred to him that since we're\nabout to be wiped off the planet we ought to have a military\ncommander. For the look of the thing, you reckon? You know, I dreamed\nof space travel from the time I was five. Never imagined I'd do it\nwith a Sunday school. Don't hurry of course. Just come when it damn\nwell suits you.\"\n\nPaul caught up with him on the trail. \"Look, Ed--\"\n\n\"I'll recite it for you: mustn't lose my temper. We mustn't divide;\nmustn't quarrel; Doc's word is holy at all times--\"\n\n\"No one says that.\"\n\nSpearman wasn't listening. \"Goddamn it, why do you think I've gone\naway alone so often? To explore, sure, to find things we need. By God\nI've found 'em too, haven't I? Also to get away from the Sunday\nschool. Beating my brains out to win a little advance--you people\ncan't see--\"\n\n\"What do _you_ think we should do? I mean right now--Lantis.\"\n\nSpearman fretted in silence, striding as if speed and heavy steps\ncould ease his distress. \"Why, we ought to have gone to live at\nPakriaa's village a year ago, after the reconciliation, while they\nwere still dizzy from the fall of the idol. You remember--Pak was\nalmost humble. Ready for big changes. We could have done anything with\nher--then. Eliminated the witches. Taught and trained the best of her\nfollowers. We'd have ironworking now. We'd have a competent army. Why,\nwe could take the initiative, drive south, break up anything Lantis\nmay have while she's on the march. Yeah--a year ago. Sure--Mijok\nwouldn't approach the village, so _we_ mustn't move there. Every day\nis an opportunity thrown away, wasted.\"\n\n\"You think we should have abandoned the giants?\"\n\n\"What've they _got_?\" Spearman cried. \"Don't even understand\nwork--throw things around at a great rate, and then somebody sees a\nnew bug or has a funny idea or starts singing. Or asks Doc to explain\na point in philosophy. Or they decide to just sit and look at nothing\nfor two hours. Fight? Mijok talks a good fight. You couldn't make 'em\nfight with a kick in the rear.\"\n\n\"Never tried it.\"\n\nSpearman smiled miserably. \"One doesn't, with a critter eight feet\ntall.... All right, they're people. They're intelligent. If we had all\nthe time in the world and nothing threatening I'd like to study 'em\nmyself. But look at the numbers. Three on the island. Six grown women\nhere. Twelve flutterbrained children. Elis, Surok, Mijok, and the two\ntenderfeet they brought in today. Is that an army? As for right\nnow--Hell, I've given up making suggestions.\" He tensed and stopped\nshort. Paul glanced behind; Sears and Abara were catching up. \"Thought\nI heard something.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Drums.... Guess I imagined it.... Lantis must have a terrific\norganization. Bound to, Paul, in a community of sixty thousand. Hadn't\nyou thought of that at all? Communications, laws, disciplined army, a\nforest agriculture at least as good as Pakriaa's. Why, from something\nPak said, I think they even have a monetary system--anyway something\nmore elaborate than the barter that's good enough for Pak's little\ncluster of villages. Stone Age--but that's partly an accident of\necology, isn't it? I mean, they have to avoid the hills and open\nground--wouldn't be easy to get a start in metalworking when you have\nto stay in the woods. I believe they're a people under strong internal\npressure toward the next stage of civilization. With labor,\norganization, a few modern ideas, there would be ways to clean the\nkaksmas out of the hills. Then metals. We know the omasha breed on\nrock ledges wherever the kaksmas can't climb. They could be\nexterminated too. There's a whole world for the taking. Doc is right\nthat the new culture has to be a blend of ours and theirs. Oh, the\ngiants too, maybe, sometime. But it won't be done by piddling around\nwith the kind of pretty idealism that never worked even on Earth.\"\n\nPaul groped for the unspoken thing. \"You'd have us join forces with\nLantis?\"\n\nSpearman halted to stare at him. There was a flush of blood around his\neyes, the visible pain of frustration that never gave him rest. He\nwaited till Sears and Abara had come up. \"I'm a minority. I haven't\nsuggested a damned thing.\" He was silent until they reached the camp.\n\nAbro Pakriaa was there, with seven of her soldiers. All seven wore\npurple skirts, insignia of leadership--\"captains\" was the nearest\nword. With makeshift pigments and brittle whitebark, Paul had recently\npainted such a group. The effort was for Pakriaa; she had been gravely\ndelighted with it, seeing how prominent in it were her own vivid blue\nskirt and taller stature. To Paul's eyes the colors had sworn\nhorribly, and he had been glad when the princess carried the daub\naway, balanced joyfully on her bald head.\n\nPak's seven captains made it a visit of state. Wright was soberly\nintent, and Ann stood by him, regally silent; play-acting for\nPakriaa's benefit, but Ann sardonically enjoyed the pose. Pakriaa had\ngradually accepted the fact of Tocwright's leadership, but her view of\nthe status of Charin women remained addled by contradictions; the idea\nof social and mental equality between the sexes eluded her completely.\nDorothy sat watchful at the opening of the \"home\" room--Helen would be\nsleeping inside; Dorothy's fists were pushed into her cheeks, dark\neyes upturned to Pakriaa's explanatory monologue. Abara effaced\nhimself. Mijok loomed with folded arms on Wright's other side. The\nrest of the giants kept to the background.\n\n\"Abro Samiraa, Abro Kamisiaa, Abro Brodaa--\" Pakriaa was naming the\nheads of the five northern villages. A loose alliance, but those\nvillages had fought powerfully against Lantis a year ago and each\ncould provide a hundred and fifty first-line soldiers and fifty of the\nskittish male bowmen. \"They are with me, my sisters,\" Pakriaa said,\nwith sad gravity and not much of her natural swagger. \"The wormseed\nLantis has broken custom--her own people must spit on her. For the\ndeath of my messenger I spit on her heart and loins, I spit on her\nfootprints.\"\n\nThe arithmetic was simple, Paul thought. A scant twelve hundred\nfighters against a three-sided attack from over ten thousand. Four\nCharin men with rifles, automatics, scanty ammunition, heavy bows. A\nhandful of giants who knew nothing of war but theory and whose basic\nnature would revolt at the reality. Spitting wouldn't help. He forced\nhimself to attend to what Wright was saying: \"There must be one\ncommander.\"\n\n\"I give no orders to Abro Samiraa and her sisters, my equals.\"\n\n\"Would you and she and the others accept direction from one of us?\"\n\nPakriaa murmured, \"I have never seen you fight.\"\n\nSpearman laughed. Wright said, \"You will, Abro Pakriaa. If you will\naccept one of us as commander, the army can strike as one soldier.\nThere would be less confusion. And Lantis will not expect it.\"\n\nThat brought shrewdness to the little red face. \"But you can do\nnothing hiding behind this pile of stones.\"\n\n\"A temporary shelter while we shoot. You know our fire sticks. This\nbuilding commands the upper part of the lake and this end of the\nmeadow. We will not be trapped here. There will be no siege. If it is\nnecessary to retreat, we'll know the right moment to do it.\"\n\nThe oldest captain, Nisana, a wiry, quiet woman, said, \"Abro Kamisiaa\nherself spoke of a thing like this.\"\n\nPakriaa murmured absently, \"Did I give you leave to speak?\" But she\nwas not angry; she was considering it. \"This is better, Tocwright,\nwhat you say now. I will send, learn if my sisters agree. But who will\nbe the leader?\"\n\n\"That should be decided now,\" Wright said, and Paul thought: _Here it\ncomes, Ed--you get what you want at last._ And he remembered that\nobscure thing which might not have been in Spearman's mind at all:\n_desertion_--the thing was a dirty word, and the mind would not speak\nit. But Wright was staring at him--at him, not at Spearman. \"There's\nonly one of us,\" Wright said, \"who ought to lead, in this trouble.\nThat is _my_ feeling, Abro Pakriaa, but I alone cannot decide it. All\nof us here should vote on it.\"\n\nPakriaa understood the nature of a vote. Under her iron monarchy,\nminor village matters were often decided by that method if her own\nattitude happened to be neutral. Once made, and approved by herself, a\npygmy vote was binding as magic. Her gaze touched the giants with a\nsour smile. She was visibly counting; then she was studying Paul with\nnew curiosity.\n\nOf the giants, only the two new recruits were not in evidence. Paul\nglimpsed the red-furred boy peering from the doorway of Mijok's\nprivate room; Surok went in to soothe him. Pakriaa said, \"I will\nconsent. After the vote I will inform my sisters as quickly as I can.\"\n\nWright's fingers were frozen in his gray beard. \"Then I ask that Paul\nMason take command, his orders to be followed without question.\"\n\nPaul could not speak. _How did this happen? How can I...._ He heard\nAnn, imitating the formality of Wright's words, but with an undertone\nof passionate protest: \"I ask for the leadership of Edmund Spearman.\"\n\nSpearman frowned at her, flushed, proud, perhaps amazed. He said\ndoubtfully, \"Other nominations...? Voice vote?\"\n\n\"Voice vote, as you wish,\" Wright said.\n\n\"M-make it voice vote,\" Dorothy whispered, and her face was begging:\n_Is it too much? Can you stand it? Is it what I ought to do..._?\n\n\"Satisfactory,\" Spearman said. Paul nodded helplessly.\n\nDorothy said, \"Paul Mason.\"\n\nWright glanced at Pakriaa. When Spearman was nominated she had\nabandoned her patronizing air; she said with enthusiasm, \"Spearman.\"\n\nMijok's voice rumbled in the depths: \"Paul Mason.\"\n\nThe voting went quickly after that. Abara slipped into shadow and\nshook his head before Wright could call his name. Sears voted for Paul\nwith a wry attempt at a grin. Surok hesitated; his tawny face smiled\nat Paul with apology and he said, \"Spearman.\" Golden Lisson voted the\nsame way. The other giant women and Elis voted for Paul. The children\nwere quiet, not needing to be told that this was grown-up business.\nWhen one of the smallest boys started to hum, little Dunin squatted\nbehind him and covered his mouth.\n\nAll the pygmy captains but one had followed Pakriaa's lead, after a\npantomime of meditation, probably for the record. Now, with a vote of\n10-10, this one captain was full of trouble. She understood that she\nwould be the last to vote and must break the tie. This was Nisana,\ntaciturn, with the white scar of a wound that had destroyed her lower\nleft breast and run jaggedly down her side; Paul had seen her often\nbut knew little of her. She was studying the candidates with a\nmanifestly honest, tormenting effort to decide, and she avoided\nPakriaa's astounded glare. The green eyes fixed themselves at last on\none candidate with a blinding innocence.\n\n\"Paul Mason.\"\n\nPakriaa started as if slapped, but recovered quickly. She said,\n\"Tocwright, is Abara not to vote?\"\n\nAbara shuffled a step backward, two steps forward. It brought him\nnearer the bulk of Sears Oliphant. His bulging eyes tried to escape\nWright's look, and Pakriaa's; his ugly lips wobbled. He squeaked:\n\"Paul Mason.\"\n\n\"Twelve-ten,\" Wright said. \"Abro Pakriaa, I am grateful--\"\n\nPakriaa ignored him. She was saying with acid sweetness, \"Abroshin\nNisana, perhaps you wish to remain here?\"\n\nIt seemed to Paul that a mechanical force within him was taking over,\nunsought, at a moment of greatest need. \"That would be excellent, Abro\nPakriaa. If I am commander, I need one of you here: I am glad to\nselect Abroshin Nisana.\"\n\nThe princess faced him. Her eyelids flickered--usually a sign of pygmy\namusement more revealing than laughter, but one never knew, exactly.\nThe machine labored, weighing dangers and advantages. A direct order\nnow might win over Pakriaa or lose her completely and all the twelve\nhundred. She understood and admired aggressiveness; she was also a\nbundle of touchy personal pride. And--the slim spear in her hand could\nstrike like a cobra. Paul said, \"Abro Pakriaa, you will tell the other\nleaders our decision, and if they agree, have them come here at\nonce.\" There was a gray-white shadow at his left. The balance,\nswinging delicately, was visible in Pakriaa's almost sleepy eyes. He\nthought: _One thing quicker than a pygmy's arm--a giant's_. At least\nhe would not be pierced with white-stone, while Mijok stood there.\n\nPakriaa's arm swung--the harmless right arm, a harmless beckoning\ngesture to six of her captains, who followed her out of the fortress,\nleaving Abroshin Nisana staring at the ground and very much alone.\n\nSpearman came alive. He spoke plainly, cheerfully: \"Paul, count on me\nfor anything. Do whatever I can.\" His voice had full sincerity. If his\neyes were a little too steady, too candid--never mind it. It was a\npleasure to take his hand, thank him, turn to immediate needs.\n\n\"Two lifeboat trips right away, Ed, in what's left of daylight. Ann,\nSamis, and the four smallest giant children on the first. All the\ncarpentry and garden tools. Third trip in the morning.\" Wright's\nsudden relaxation was praise....\n\nAnn left, with no more protest than a backward look. But at the last\nmoment she ran back to kiss Wright on the mouth....\n\nAnd when Ed was returning from the second flight, which had carried\nDunin and four other giant children to the island--when it was night\nand the red eye of the lifeboat was slipping down from above the\nhills, then the drums began.\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nPaul heard the drums from within the room that was his and\nDorothy's--merely a section of the thatched lean-to inside the\nfortress wall, but Dorothy had given it the reality of a living place.\nThere were no chairs: one sat on a rug which was a cured uskaran pelt,\na gift from Abro Brodaa, whose people had hunted down the tigerish\nbeast after it raided her village. The bed was only a clumsy framework\nwith an asonis hide stretched across it. But the shelter had become\ndear with use, and Dorothy had hung a few of Paul's paintings on the\nwalls--a portrait of Mijok, one of Christopher Wright which had caught\nsomething of the old man's brooding alertness. The red jungle flowers\nwere too cloyingly rich to be kept here, but Dorothy had found a blue\nmeadow shrub, and a white bloom that hid in shady ground and recalled\nthe scent of jonquils....\n\nIt was too dark to see her plainly; Paul knew her eyes were open on\nhim. Barely audible against his shoulder, she said, \"I thought I'd be\ninsatiable. I only want to be near and not think.\" Nevertheless\nthought goaded her. \"Ten thousand--ten thousand--What can you _do_?\"\n\nAll he could say was rehearsed, mechanical, and she had heard it\nbefore. \"Frontal attack first, because the pygmies couldn't be led\ninto anything else. But I shall turn it into an ordered retreat--to\nthe island. Drive south, skirt the southern end of the hills, then\nstraight for the coast. We'll be at the island in--oh, soon--\"\n\n\"But the range--the coastal mountains opposite the island--you can't\ncross them--they rise so sheer--\"\n\n\"Remember the river that flows almost due west from these little\nhills? It comes to the sea north of the range. We'll make rafts to get\ndown that, I think. There aren't any falls. At the coast we'll\ncontrive something--dugouts with outriggers. I've already shown old\nRak how to make one; he may be working on it now.\"\n\nDorothy pressed a hand over his mouth. She stammered, \"Make this\nmoment last.\" But even during the fine sharp agony there were words:\n\"I shall keep--a bonfire on that beach--night and day....\" and when\nhis hand was slack in her hair and she seemed to be hardly breathing,\nPaul heard the drums.\n\nThey were far off and everywhere. Only the remembering brain insisted they\nwere on the lake. They were not sound at all, at first. A pressure pain in\nthe back of the skull, a rasping of nerve endings. Nothing but drums.\nHollow logs with a hide membrane, rubbed and pounded by tiny painted\nsavages. \"You must go tonight after all.\" Dorothy could not speak. He put\nHelen in her fumbling arms; he hurried out to the open space, saw the eye\nof the lifeboat returning. The drums took on a rhythm, a throbbing in 5/8\ntime, rapid, venomous. But far away. Still not quite\nsound--_Ah_-ah-ah-ah-ah, _ah_-ah-ah-ah-ah--growing no nearer, no louder,\nbut gaining in vicious urgency, relentless as a waterfall, a runaway\nmachine. _Ah_-ah-ah-ah-ah....\n\nPaul hoped that Wright and Sears might be sleeping. It would be an\nhour yet before Pakriaa could return with the other leaders, if indeed\nshe ever did. Elis and Abara were on sentry duty. The three giant\nchildren still at the camp--would they be sleepless, keyed up to vivid\nfantasies of the island, like Charin children before a great journey?\n\nKamon sat alone by the gate. A small figure drooped at the other end\nof the enclosure. Since there was no immediate task for her, Paul had\ntold Abroshin Nisana to rest, but he knew her little bald head turned\nto follow him. \"Kamon--I'm going to have the third flight made\ntonight. There would be room for you too in the boat. Will you go?\"\n\nBlack lips and ancient white face smiled up at him. \"If you wish.\"\n\n\"I do. Stay close to Dorothy. That will leave four of you giant women\nhere. I wish they could all go. Tejron's sober and wise--she'll keep\nthem together. You're more needed on the island. Don't let Dorothy be\nmuch alone.\"\n\nThe old woman mused: \"This Charin love is a strange thing. It isn't\nour natures for two persons to come so close. But I see something good\nin it, I think....\" Paul struggled to hear her over the almost\nsubsonic yammer of the drums. _Ah_-ah-ah-ah-ah--it seemed not to\ntrouble Kamon much, though she would be hearing it even more plainly.\n\"I will stay with her, Paul,\" she said, and watched the long glide as\nSpearman brought the boat in.\n\nOn the drawbridge Spearman cocked his head at the drums. \"That's it.\"\nHe read Paul's thought: \"The rest tonight, huh? Better, I'd think.\"\n\n\"Yes. Get something to eat, why don't you? Kamon is going too.\"\n\nSpearman nodded, unsurprised. \"Not hungry.... Wonder how long they\nkeep it up....\"\n\nWright came from his room with sleepless eyes. \"Till they attack,\nprobably. All night, maybe all tomorrow. To soften us up. Damn\nthem....\"\n\nSomehow Paul was walking to the boat, carrying the baby for Dorothy.\nHe climbed in with her, adjusted the straps. Helen waked and was\nfretful till she found the breast \"You bore her alone--without any--\"\n\n\"Alone!\" Dorothy was astonished. \"I had you. Doc's a fine medical man,\nwhatever he says. Don't you remember how Mijok held out his arm for me\nto grab when it got tough? He said, 'I am a tree.'\" Now she was\nholding his look with an indestructible smile until the rest came and\nPaul had to back out of the cramped cabin to give them room; then had\nto stand aside while the bright relic of twenty-first-century man spat\nits green flame and hot gases at the lake and leaped to soaring and\nslid into moonless darkness above the hills. The drums wept, raved,\nobscenely whispered.\n\nPaul did not know Sears Oliphant was with him till he heard the voice:\n\"I think, Paul--the drums defeat their purpose. They make me sore\ninstead of scared. I think you won't need to worry about me, Paul.\"\n\n\"I never have.\" He glanced at the fat man's holstered automatic,\nremembered the cleanness of the rifle hanging in Sears' room. \"My\nfather used to say most men are good watchdogs, who know they're\nscared but stand guard in spite of it; only a few are rabbits and\npossums.\" Paul turned his back on the hills. Nothing was there to\nsee, nothing at all. \"I wish you'd known my father. He was a tall man.\nNuts about animals--always brought 'em into the talk--illustration,\nexample. Couldn't stand to see even a wasp beating against the glass;\nyou never knew when a deer mouse would climb out of his pocket and run\ndown his pants leg.\" Paul laughed. The drums fretted in 5/8,\npassionate, soft, cruel.\n\nSears watched blue fireflies over a lake so peacefully still that the\nsapphire reflections were as real as their cause. \"A teacher, wasn't\nhe?\"\n\n\"For a while, till he settled in New Hampshire. They wouldn't let him\nteach nineteenth and twentieth-century history as he saw it. He saw it\nin terms of ethical conflict, the man versus the state, self-reliance\nversus the various dreary socialisms, enlightened altruism versus\ndon't-stick-your-neck-out, and he didn't give a good god-damn whether\nthe first atomic submersible was built in 1952 or '53. Doc would have\nloved him too: he knew what was meant by a government of laws. He made\nhis students search out not only theory but the actual dismal\nconsequences of the doctrine that the end justifies the\nmeans--Alexander, Augustus, Napoleon, Lenin, Hitler. That was regarded\nas 'wilfully minimizing the significance of technological advance.' He\ndidn't minimize it; he just recognized that other matters were vastly\nmore important, and he didn't care to see the machine built up into\none more mumbo jumbo. So he sent me through college by breeding\nchildren's riding ponies and selling hatching eggs. Not a bad life, or\nso he said.... Jocko, will Pakriaa come back?\"\n\n\"I believe so.... Ah, Chris--nice evening for the month of Charin.\"\n\nWright was a paleness in the dark; stern, weary, tall, watching the\nlake, talking to himself: \"The month we named for ourselves--end of\nYear One--oh, I do call that a pardonable vanity.... Paul, I was\nwholly selfish in choosing you. I've given you a burden no one should\nhave to carry.\"\n\n\"We're all carrying it.\"\n\n\"Thank you, son.\" Wright moved away to stand alone at the rim of the\nlake, listening to the crawling thunder of the drums. Twice, Paul\nheard him speak, with an intensity beyond pain: \"No one is expendable.\nNo one is expendable....\"\n\nSears exclaimed, \"Look!\" There were five white cloud-like shapes at\nthe edge of the woods. \"Oh, they've never done this before. Susie!\nWhat's the matter? There now, girl, come tell the old man--\"\n\nPaul followed him. \"It's the drums--don't you think?\"\n\nThe five had been complaining softly, but that ceased as Sears moved\namong them, patting their legs, soothing them. \"But Paul--their\ngrounds are mostly north of here--there now, Mister Smith, you old\nbastard--so why didn't they travel away from the sound? Take it easy,\nMillie, Miss Ponsonby--\"\n\n\"The wild ones probably did. But these had to come to you.\"\n\n\"Oh.... That detachment of Lantis--the one in the northeast--\"\n\n\"Don't think so, Jocko. Pakriaa's spies are all around up there--we'll\nhave warning. Elis is posted half a mile north of us--he'd know--smell\n'em if he didn't hear 'em. However, I'll go talk with him....\"\n\nThe depth of forest muted the drums--a little; they were still a\ncumulative torture of anger in the inner darkness of the mind. Paul\nsaved the fading power of his Earth-made radion flashlight by\nfollowing his sense of the trail. He had learned to move as softly in\nthe jungle as any Charin could hope to do--more softly than Spearman,\nsoftly enough to steal within spear range of the asonis. There was not\nmuch danger here, unless it might be from the uskaran, a beast Paul\nhad glimpsed alive only once and then dimly, a striped thing slipping\nsnakily out of his vision in a sun-striped afternoon; the rug in his\nand Dorothy's room could almost have been a tiger pelt. The black\nreptiles were lovers of hot sun and shallow water, never going inland.\nThe squeak and rustle of a kaksma horde, it was said, could be heard\nfar off except during the rains, when all noises were smothered in the\nlong rush and whispering of waters. For all his silence, black Elis\nwas aware of him before Paul knew he had reached the sentry post.\n\"Paul--isn't it?\" The night vision of the giants was better than the\nCharins' but not like a cat's; they hunted at night only if the moon\nwas strong.\n\n\"Yes. Everything quiet?\"\n\n\"Quieter than my heart.\"\n\nPaul still could not see him. \"Saving my flashlight. Where are you?\"\nElis chuckled and slipped an invisible hand around Paul's. \"The\nolifants came to the meadow. We wondered what disturbed them.\"\n\n\"Drums. Nothing in the northeast yet. But a great many of the pygmies\nare moving from the upper villages. I heard, and smelled the red\nflowers.\" The people of Lantis, Pakriaa said, never wore those\nflowers, and it would not be the nature of Elis to exaggerate his\npowers of smell and hearing.\n\n\"I think the animals wanted Sears. Could that be, Elis?\"\n\n\"Alojna--\" Elis murmured the old word for them: it meant \"white\ncloud.\" \"Two things nobody knows--the thoughts of Alojna and the\njourneys of the red moon and the white moon when we cannot see them.\nSo we used to say. You give us a hint of knowledge of both things, and\nmore than a hint of much greater mysteries.\" Elis had always been\ntireless in questioning Wright; more than Mijok, he was haunted by a\nneed to grope after intangibles, push outward the uneasy border\nbetween known and unknown. \"So there's never an end of mystery?\"\n\n\"Never.\" The hand was warm. \"What is the nature of courage?\"\n\nThe giant's breathing was too quiet to be heard. \"To go out, away from\na world, in a little shell--that must have needed courage.\"\n\n\"Perhaps only a response to a drive of uncomprehended forces. But I\nthink courage is a known thing, Elis, an achievement of flesh and\nblood--to hear the drums in the dark and stay at the post as you are\ndoing, as I hope I can do myself. I must go back. Lisson will come and\nrelieve you soon....\"\n\nPakriaa had returned, with her five equals. Wright had lit one of the\nclay lamps. It burned pleasantly with an oil from the carcasses of the\nsame reptile that had once nearly destroyed Mijok, a thing which\npleased Mijok, for he liked to think that a creeping danger could also\nbe a source of light; and the use of this oil had been taught them by\nthe pygmies, who made almost monthly expeditions to marshy regions and\nbutchered the beasts by the dozens for the oil alone.\n\nPakriaa was almost meek. Her smile for Paul could have been a Charin\nsmile; there was a tremor in her hands, and once they flew up to cover\nher ears. The drums, he thought, might be a worse pain for her than\nfor his own breed. There was unconscious pathos in the precision of\nher English: \"I did not make clear that I will obey you. I may have\nbeen angry; for that I am sorry--it is past. My sisters have agreed.\"\n\nSquat Abro Samiraa; lame, thin Abro Kamisiaa; sober Abro Brodaa--these\nthree Paul had met before. Abro Duriaa and Abro Tamisraa were from the\nfarthest villages, and shy; Duriaa was fat, with a foolish giggle;\nTamisraa had a feral furtiveness--the painted bones of her necklace\nlooked like human vertebrae. In Abro Samiraa Paul saw competence as\nwell as smoldering violence: the green of her eyes was dark jade; she\nwas a flat pillar of muscle from shoulder to hip. Paul guessed her to\nbe a devil of bravery, good in the front line and intelligent. Lame\nKamisiaa's bravery would be shrewd, vicious, and careful. In fat\nDuriaa he thought he saw a politician, not a fighter; in Abro\nBrodaa--there might be a thinker, even a dreamer, in Abro Brodaa.\n\nThe princesses had brought news. A scout from Brodaa's village had\nsucceeded in locating the northeastern detachment of Lantis' army; it\nwas camped twelve miles to the northeast, on the far side of a deep\nbut narrow stream. The scout had shown the kind of nerve the pygmies\ntook for granted: she had crossed the creek to listen in the reeds and\nhad drifted downstream the entire length of the encampment. The\nVestoians were careless, overconfident, their dialect enough like her\nown so that she could grasp the essentials; their unit was six hundred\nstrong, with no bowmen. The scout had heard discontented soldiers'\ntalk: the spearwomen missed their subject males, who were camp\nfollowers as well as second-line fighters. Returning, the scout had\nlocated and stalked a Vestoian sentry, stunned and gagged her, and\nbrought her to Brodaa's camp, where she was made to talk. Brodaa had\nbeen about to describe this when Pakriaa glanced at Sears and\ninterrupted: \"They plan to cross the stream before daylight, move\nstraight west, and try to push us down into the open ground, where the\nrest of the army will roll over us.\"\n\n_The sentry is probably dead. I don't want to know, not now...._ The\nmachine in Paul took charge of the council of war, rejecting\ncompassion, rejecting everything beyond immediate need. \"Abro\nSamiraa--take the soldiers of your village and of Abro Duriaa's. Abro\nDuriaa, you will be in command of your own people, but accept Abro\nSamiraa's orders as if they were mine.\" Pakriaa intervened to\ntranslate for the fat woman, who showed no hostility but rather\nrelief, and placed her hands formally under the spread fingers of Abro\nSamiraa in token of subordination. \"Abro Samiraa, take those three\nhundred and the bowmen to the stream as quickly as you can with\nsilence, and attack. The important thing is to scatter them before\nthey are ready to move. If they retreat, follow them only enough to\nconfuse them and then return here at once. If you can take prisoners,\nbring them here, unharmed. But do not be drawn into any long pursuit.\nThere are still eleven hours of darkness. I hope to see you return\nlong before sunrise.\"\n\n\"Good!\" Pakriaa exclaimed, and Samiraa grunted with pleasure. Brodaa\nsaid, \"Take my scout, sister. I have given her the purple skirt; she\nis Abroshin now, and my friend.\" Duriaa waddled behind, and Paul sent\nAbroshin Nisana to relieve Abara from sentry duty. Nisana was glad to\ngo, for Pakriaa still sent her sour glances, remembering the election.\n\nSears was fretting: \"My pets. Damn it, Paul, I dunno--they're huddled\nout there in the meadow--just get in the way, get hurt.\"\n\n\"Would they follow Abara?\"\n\n\"I think so....\" Abara slipped in and puffed with pride when he\nlearned what was wanted. \"Certainly they will follow Mister Johnson,\nand Mister Johnson will follow me.\"\n\nPakriaa laughed. She caught him by a prominent ear and hugged him to\nher leanness, grinning at Brodaa over his head. \"So ugly!\" Pakriaa\nnibbled his neck. \"And he leads olifants! Don't be afraid, little\nhusband--I was never angry with you. Look at him!\" She spun him\naround for the lewd admiration of the other royalty. \"I couldn't do\nwithout him. When the war is over I'll have him back in my bed. But\nnow he leads olifants. Hurry, Abara--and don't hurt yourself.\" And she\nsent him off with a pinch.\n\n\"Keep them in the woods,\" Paul told him. \"And stay with them.\"\n\n\"Good.\" Pakriaa sobered. \"He could do nothing. He never learned the\nbow.... Ah, look!\" The red dot of the lifeboat had caught her eye.\n\"Look, Abro Tamisraa--you never saw it fly at night.\" It moved with\napparent slowness, like a mad star, not toward them but toward the\nlake, perhaps ten miles away; it was still high when the searchlight\nbeam stabbed down, probing from northeast to southwest, and vanished.\n\"It's all right,\" Paul said, \"I suggested he scout the lake on the way\nback....\" The red eye silently tumbled; Wright gasped. \"Still all\nright,\" said Paul. \"A dive. He can make it talk.\" But the moment\ndragged out into an ugliness of waiting.\n\nThen orange fury glared against the underside of clouds and the clamor\nof drums abruptly ceased. Paul said loudly, mechanically, \"I think he\ngave 'em the jet--set a few boats afire. I didn't order it, Doc. And\nwouldn't try it myself....\" Now the red dot was shooting upward,\ndisappearing as the boat circled once, then growing larger. Briefly\nthe searchlight illuminated the meadow, and Spearman came in,\novershooting slightly, driving almost to the moat before he checked.\nHe swaggered in, satisfied. \"See it?\"\n\n\"Uh-huh. What did you learn?\"\n\n\"Those were drum boats. Why, my God, they opened out like little\norange flowers...! Well--the main fleet is 'way behind them, say\nthirty miles down the lake, coming slow. Couldn't spot the land\narmy--no campfires.\"\n\n\"All right. Sit in on this, Ed....\" And the plan was drawn up, so far\nas there could be a plan when the odds were ten to one in a world that\nnever asked for them.\n\nPaul, with Mijok and Pakriaa, would lead three hundred spearwomen and\na hundred bowmen south before daylight, in the hope of disorganizing\nthe advance with surprise and gunfire, but unless the Vestoians were\ndemoralized beyond expectation, this could be only a skirmish. They\nwould fall back, try to avoid losses. The remainder of the army would\nstay at the edge of the woods until Lantis was in sight: Wright at the\nfortress with the giant women, now only four, who could handle rifles;\nAbro Kamisiaa and Abro Brodaa in the center; Sears and Abro Tamisraa\non the right flank in the west, with Elis and Surok. Spearman in the\nlifeboat would follow the advance party at first-light. Paul said\nnothing of the second drive, to the southeast, the retreat that would\nseem like attack. When the time came for that, he must have in one\nunit all that remained after the first wrath had spent itself--and\neven then the pygmies would have to believe that they were attacking\nsingle-heartedly, or they could not reach the southern end of the\nrange, but would probably be driven into the trap of the kaksma hills.\n\nThe drums began again. They began after the council was ended and\nSears had gone to take charge of his command on the right flank, with\nElis and Surok and shifty Tamisraa. The other small red sovereigns had\ngone too, and Wright had stalked into his room--to sleep, he said--and\nPaul had followed Spearman out to the boat, where Spearman would sleep\nuntil it was time to go. Spearman tapped his elbow. \"You're surprising\nme, boy. Better than I could have done, I think. We'll knock 'em\nover.\" And the drums began.\n\nSpearman stared off at the lake; after a while he grinned, and the\nlamp burning in the fortress caught the grimace. \"Yeah,\" he sighed,\n\"well, I knew I only singed 'em.\" He climbed into the boat and glanced\ndown with a half salute, which Paul answered mechanically. But as Paul\nwalked away the thought stirred: _That was like goodbye...._\n\nPaul went along the path at the edge of the woods. It was wide and\neasy, broadened during the Year One by much travel between the camp\nand Pakriaa's village. There were occasional small-voiced greetings\nfrom the woods: these were Kamisiaa's and Brodaa's people, who knew\nhim. Brodaa cherished a painting he had made of the singing waterfall\nabove her village in return for that uskaran pelt. Many of these\nsoldiers would be chosen by Pakriaa to bring up the number of the\nadvance party to four hundred.\n\nThere was no red moon tonight. The white moon was half the size of the\nplanet Earth, so far away that its glow was scarcely more than that of\na star, but Paul knew that by what light it gave the pygmies could see\nhim smile in response to their greetings. They would be studying him,\ntrying to weigh the tone of his answer. _One of them might save my\nlife tomorrow; certainly I shall have to see some of them die. They\nare people._\n\nThere were two visible planets to follow the wandering of the no\nlonger alien star that was the sun. One was hidden tonight; the other,\nred like Mars, hung over the eastern jungle in tranquillity. A little\nshape detached itself from the trees to meet him. Abro Pakriaa. \"Will\nyou not sleep tonight, Paul, before we go?\" It was a human question,\nsweetly spoken and meant kindly.\n\n\"Later, I think.\" He stood by her awhile; in the blackness from which\nshe had come there was a steady mumbling, and Paul knew what it was:\nthe witches also had their part to play in these heavy hours, although\nlong before battle was joined they would be cowering in the villages.\nSomewhere in the tree shadows they were squatting, muttering the\nantique prayers. He wondered whether to go on and visit with Sears\nawhile. _No: Elis is a rock, better company than I would be at the\nmoment...._ There was much, he thought, that would be good to talk\nabout with Pakriaa tonight; there ought to be words that would reach\nher. Perhaps on this night a glimpse of Wright's vision would meet\nwith something better than amusement and distrust. But in the end he\nonly said, \"We'll always be good friends, you and I.\"\n\nHe thought she might take hold of his hand in the Charin gesture. She\ndid not--undignified perhaps. But she said, \"Tocwright says we are all\none flesh.\" She said it thoughtfully, without contempt.\n\n\"Yes. We are all one flesh.\" And lest he become a true Charin and\nspoil a moment of truth with unnecessary words, Paul turned back to\nthe camp, seeing that she remained there in the open, looking south,\nthe grumbling witches behind her, before her the long night of drums\nand no red moon.\n\nMijok was not asleep. He sat cross-legged by the lamp. \"I wanted to\nthank you. Doc's gone to sleep at last, and before I could find the\nwords I wanted. It will be difficult to talk in the morning.\"\n\nPaul sat by him, puzzled. \"To thank me?\"\n\n\"Because I've learned so much. And had so much pleasure in the\nlearning.\" Mijok yawned amiably, stretching his arms. \"To thank you\nfor that, in case you or I should be dead tomorrow.\"\n\nIt would have been easy to say: \"Oh, we'll be all right--\" Something\nlike that. Paul buried the words unspoken, knowing their triviality\nwould be a discourtesy, a dismissal of the insight and patience which\nmade it possible for Mijok to speak so casually. Mijok loved to be\nalive; there was no moment of day or night that he did not relish, if\nonly for its newness and from his sense that every gift of time is a\ntrue gift. \"I thank you for being with us.\" Mijok accepted the words\nwithout embarrassment or second thought.\n\n\"Why, you know,\" he said, \"in the old days I never even knew that\nplants were alive. But look at this--\" He lifted one of Dorothy's\nwhite flowers from his knee. \"It was in your room, Paul. She put it\nbeside that painting you made of me, before she left.\" He peered into\nthe white mouth of the flower, touched the fat stamens, and stroked\nthe slim stalk. \"Everything it needs. Like ourselves. But I never knew\nthat. We are all one flesh.\"\n\nPaul glanced over his shoulder. The red planet like Mars was still\nhigh over the jungle. He thought: _When that is hidden, it will be\ntime to go._\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nAll night Paul heard the distant barbarous thunder of the drums. In\nthe hour before first-light his advance company formed; a furious\nserpent, it stole two miles south through grassland following the\npallor of the beach. Near first-light, Paul knew, they would see a\nthread of new moon. In this present darkness the Vestoians might be\nslipping north on the lake; there would be no betraying sound above\nthe passion of the drums. As for the land army, that could be miles to\nthe south or over the next rise of ground.\n\nHis mind fought a pressure of alternatives. Better to have kept the\narmy in one unit? To wait in the forest for news of Abro Samiraa's\nthrust in the northeast? _Never mind: no time now._ At least his body\nwas meeting the challenge without rebellion. His wiry legs carried him\nin silence; his senses were whetted to fineness. Rifle, pistol, field\nglasses, hunting knife made a light load. Ahead of him Mijok loomed\nagainst a division of two shadows, sky and earth. Not first-light:\nonly a sign that five thousand miles away on the eastern shore of this\ncontinent there might be the shining of a star now called the sun.\nMijok carried a shield of doubled asonis hide; his only weapon was a\nseven-foot club, since his smallest finger was too large to pass the\ntrigger guard of a rifle. Though keeping watch with Paul, Mijok had\nspoken little during the night--brooding perhaps, trying (Paul\nimagined) to see a new world in the matrix of the old. But there was\nno guessing a giant's thoughts. Lacking the stale burden of human\nguilt and compromise, they had the strength as well as the weakness of\ninnocence; the country of their minds must wait on the explorations of\ncenturies.\n\nAbro Pakriaa, close to Paul's right, moved like a breeze in the\ngrass. She and her small soldiers despised the use of shields,\ndespised the arrows of their own bowmen as fit only for timid males.\nThey never threw their spears but kept them for close quarters; their\nonly other weapon was a white-stone dagger.... The army groped through\nthe meadow in three ranks, widely spaced at Paul's order; beyond the\nright flank the archers were concentrated. Four hundred fighters\naltogether--against six thousand.\n\nA wooded knoll grew into silhouette fifty yards from the beach, ten\nfeet above the level of the meadow. \"We meet them here,\" Paul said. By\nprearrangement Pakriaa halted a hundred of her spearwomen between the\nknoll and the beach, the other two hundred on the west side, the\nhundred bowmen out beyond. Paul and Mijok penetrated the blackness of\nthe knoll, pushing through to its southern side, where Pakriaa joined\nthem. Even in that short passage the heaviness of dark had altered\nwith a promise. There were few clouds. The day (if it ever came) would\nbe hot, windless, and beautiful. No more blue fireflies were\nwandering. The planet Lucifer had become three gray enigmas of lake\nand meadow and sky, but in this blind hush when morning was still the\nsupposition of a dream, the shapes of the trees were attaining a\nseparate reality; in the west Paul could find a hint of the low hills\nstanding between him and the West Atlantic.\n\nSeventy or eighty miles over yonder Dorothy's brown eyes would be\nwatching for first-light on the sea, watching for it not on the great\nsea, he knew, but on the channel that shut her away from the mainland,\nfrom himself. With his child at her breast, another unknown life in\nthe womb. Ann Bryan too, her troubled secret mind still full of\nprotest at the contradictions and unfulfilled promises which made up\nthe climate of life on Lucifer as well as elsewhere; and the ancient\ngiantess Kamon, and Rak and Muson, Samis, Arek, and those giant\nchildren perennially puzzling and lovable.... _No time._ Mijok was\npeering out on the west side of the knoll. \"Nicely hidden. Your\nsoldiers are very good, Abro Pakriaa,\" said the giant, whose knowledge\nof war was almost as dim a product of theory as his knowledge of the\nplanet Earth, where his Charin friends had been born.\n\nThe pygmy princess did not answer. Paul thought with held-in anger:\n_Can't she understand even now that Mijok is one of us, the best of\nus...?_ But Pakriaa was staring south; she might not have heard. She\npointed.\n\nThus, after a year of waiting, wonder, rumor; a year when Lantis of\nVestoia, Queen of the World, had been a half-mythical terror, symbol\nof tyranny and danger but not a person; a year that Ed Spearman spoke\nof as \"lost to the piddlings of philosophy\"--Paul saw them at last.\n\nSaw rather a waving of the grass, a cluster of dots shifting, bobbing,\nadvancing. Pakriaa's tree-frog voice was calm: \"They come fast. They\nwant to reach our forest before the light makes the omasha fly. Your\nplan is good, Paul: we hold them in the open, the omasha have good\nmeat.\"\n\nA man could dourly accept it, somehow. Bred to gentleness,\nundestructive labor, study, contemplation, Paul could tell himself\nthat a certain spot (even as it bloomed like a nodding flower in the\ntelescopic sights) was not flesh and blood and nerve, only a target.\n_Would it be so if I were fighting only for myself...?_ He held the\nspot in focus; he said, \"Your soldiers are prepared for the fire\nstick? They know they must not charge till they have the order from\nyou?\"\n\nHer voice had warmth: \"And they know you are my commander.\"\n\nPaul squeezed the trigger.\n\n_Too soon--and too damned quiet._ The clever makers of\ntwenty-first-century firearms on Earth had cut down the shout of a .30\ncaliber to a trivial snap. The savage eyes out there might not even\nhave caught the flash at the muzzle. There ought to have been the\nglare and circumstance of a rocket. How could they be panicked by a\nsilly pop and a spark? Even though--well, one of the dots had\nvanished, true enough. Maybe he had killed his first human being.\n\nHe glanced westward, wondering how soon the gray must change to\nsaffron and crimson. The new red moon--there it was. A bloody sliver\nof a sword above the far shore of the lake.\n\nAnd he saw the boats.\n\nThey were half a mile out. No others were visible north of them, but\nthat meant nothing: these might or might not be the lead canoes of\nthe fleet. The noise of drum boats in the south was constant: those\nwould stay anchored in hiding, letting their wrath appear to come from\nall parts of the world.\n\nThe leading boat jumped to clarity in the sights. Forward the bark\nroofing reached the gunwale; aft, the sides were open to leave space\nfor two paddlers. Paul saw the tight mouth of the one on the port\nside: she could have been Pakriaa's blood sister. Now it was necessary\nto think of Abro Pakriaa's ambassador torn in quarters, head and arms\nsent back as a message from the Queen of the World--until the mind of\nthe student of Christopher Wright rebelled: _Vengeance was one of the\nape's first discoveries._ It became more necessary to think: _Make it\na good head shot--she won't feel it...._\n\nIt was not a very good shot. The scream came weakly across the water.\nThe paddler tumbled, an arm dangling. The starboard paddler seemed not\nto understand and labored stupidly, making the canoe lurch to port.\nThe prow of a following boat rammed it, tore away the matting,\nrevealed the huddled soldiers who became splashing legs and arms in a\nsudden foam. While the land army came on....\n\nDots that were bald red heads, white specks that were spear blades. A\nsimple arithmetic: less than a hundred rounds for the rifle; four\nhundred soldiers; a heart divided but angry, and the devotion of an\neight-foot giant with a big stick. Against six thousand in the land\narmy alone. \"Pakriaa, it's a single column--the fools! Send your\nbowmen out west, catch them on the flank.\" Pakriaa ran down the knoll.\n\nPaul shot twice at the head of the column. A flurry. No halt. Some of\nthe boats were no longer sliding north, but driving down on the beach,\nforty or fifty, like hornets from a torn nest. _Another mistake--no,\nnot if it diverts them from the camp._ Pakriaa's hundred on this side\nof the knoll were holding firm for an order. Paul's wave was enough:\nthey spread out in the grass at the edge of the beach, quivering like\nwaiting cats. The light was changing their bodies from vagueness to\nfamiliar copper, black skirts, white body paint.... Mijok tore a\nhalf-buried rock from the ground and hurled it out to splinter the\nnearest boat. But the soldiers would merely swim ashore. \"Mijok! Stay\nwith me!\"\n\nThe head of that column was less than two hundred yards away. Paul\nfired mechanically, seeing life tumble backward and lie still. \"Let\nthem see us now, Pakriaa, Mijok----\"\n\nThey strode down the south slope of the knoll in plain sight under the\nbeginning of morning as the bowmen in the meadow released a harsh\nflight. The beach on the left became a seething of yells, snarling,\ntrampling, clash of white stone. _First-light--first-light--and where\nin damnation is Ed Spearman with the lifeboat...?_\n\nThe column was confused by the many pressing up from behind. A few\ndozen spearwomen streamed out toward Pakriaa's archers; a second and\nthird flight downed most of them--the little men had skill. No\nVestoian bowmen had appeared. \"Now, Pakriaa----\"\n\nHer one cry brought the spearwomen out of the grass west of the knoll,\nskimming forward like red bullets, spears low in the left hand until\nthey crashed into the column; then weapons rose and plunged and rose.\n\nThe Vestoians wore no white paint. Their leaders had caps of green.\nTheir grass skirts were mere fringes. They died easily. They killed\neasily.\n\nSome distance down the column--for it was still a column, still a\nrolling machine that could not halt--a tall structure was swaying,\nhard to assess in this tortured twilight. A litter? Lantis of Vestoia,\nthe Queen of the World herself? Paul checked his own running advance\nto send two shots at it. Then he and Mijok were surrounded by a\nwrithing of arms, white-stone, and blood, Mijok raging but bewildered.\nPaul saw Pakriaa's spear drive down below naked ribs and withdraw from\nwhat sprawled on the ground. She was untouched. Her lean little body\ndripped with sweat, her teeth gleamed in a devil's grin. Two\npurple-skirted captains joined her; the three smashed into a cluster\nof shrieking souls who only began to understand what was happening.\n\nArithmetic still ruled. This column might be only one of many pushing\nup between lake and hills, bent on reaching Pakriaa's forest before\nthe omasha soared in from those hills to feed on living and dead.\n\nMijok brushed through the fighters with his shield and down the line\ntill he was clear of Pakriaa's white-painted demons. His stick swung,\ndestroying everything in a half circle before him. He was not confused\nnow, not even shouting, but saving breath. He worked stolidly, like a\nman beating at a swarm of rats.... Pakriaa jumped on a fallen thing to\npoint at that clumsy framework down the line. \"Lantis! That is\nLantis----\"\n\nThe litter wobbled toward the center of confusion on the shoulders of\nsix women. Paul fired twice again at it. He had a glimpse of a scrawny\nfigure with a high green headdress leaping down, snatching a spear,\nvanishing in an improvised protective phalanx. He shot into that,\ndropping one of the outer soldiers. Mijok saw; he changed the course\nof his attack, a bulldozer aiming at a new clump of brush. Pakriaa\nscreamed in frenzy, without meaning. Her spear was still a part of\nher. She was bleeding from a thigh wound; her bright blue skirt had\nbeen torn away; she glittered with sweat and paint and blood, a\ndancing devil mindlessly happy. Then she was down once more in the\npress, squirming toward the phalanx, and Paul could not shoot.\n\nBut it was the toiling giant, Paul thought, who made Lantis break.\nAgain he saw the snarling face of the Queen of the World and heard her\nsqueal an order. Before Mijok could cut his way to her the phalanx was\nrunning, sheltered by the mere mass of soldiers. It was necessary to\ncall Mijok back.\n\nThe whole Vestoian army was running. \"Pakriaa!\" Paul plunged after\nher, caught her shoulder. \"No pursuit!\" Her eyes glazed in mad\nrejection; he thought she would bite his wrist. \"Turn your soldiers!\nBring them down on the Vestoians from the boats--_the boats_!\"\n\nShe could understand that. Her order was the shriek of a rusty nail on\nglass, and it turned them. It brought them howling down to the beach\nto aid what was left of the first hundred. The water was a jumble of\nabandoned boats--even the paddlers had struggled ashore to kill and\ndie.\n\nMijok ploughed in a second time.... That ended it. Some of the\nVestoians might have glimpsed what he did to the land soldiers. A few\nforgot all custom and threw their spears, which Mijok's shield\ncarelessly turned; then they stared with sickness at their empty\nhands and waited for the club. Meanwhile the strengthened crowd of\npygmies worked on till the sand was redder than the sky and there was\nno more to be done. \"Back!\"\n\nPakriaa screamed \"No!\" and pointed south. Paul stumbled on something\nslippery. He stooped to her, yelling, _\"Omasha!_ The sky will be full\nof them. Let them fight Lantis. We've lost a hundred already----\"\n\nHer face became sane and blank in agony. \"My people--my people----\"\n\n\"Yes! And other boats are still going north. Your soldiers must pick\nup the hurt and run for it.\"\n\nThere were not many living wounded in this sudden quiet. A spear has\nscant mercy. And the lifeboat had not come.... Mijok was holding out\nhis shield on both arms; he had tossed his stick aside. \"Put them on\nthis. I can carry six--seven.\" When the shield could hold no more he\nlifted it, his face contorted and changed. \"Paul--I told myself I was\nback in the old life, when we always killed them if we could. But the\nnew laws--oh, Paul, _the laws_----\"\n\n\"War perverts all laws. But the laws are true. It is--climbing a\nmountain, Mijok: we slip, fall back, try again. Nothing good in war,\nonly necessity, choice of evils. Now make the best speed you can,\nfriend--don't wait for us.\" Mijok ran with his vast strides, holding\nthe shield out in front so that the motion of his body would not\njounce it.\n\nPakriaa would not move till the last of the survivors had stumbled\npast her. They were disciplined. Already some of the soft bowmen had\ntaken out arrows of the whining, glittering type that sometimes\nfrightened off the omasha. They were ready. Paul tried to count, gave\nit up. Less than three hundred. The archers had not suffered much.\nPaul said, \"Your leg is hurt, Abro Pakriaa. I'll carry you.\"\n\nShe was indifferent. \"I thank you.\" He slung his rifle and caught her\nup, naked and slippery with blood and acrid-smelling paint. Her weight\nwas less than forty pounds. Her head lolled back; she whispered to the\nsky, \"No one should call me Abro. I am Pakriaa the child, weak as a\nmale, a fool. I could have followed. I could have brought her to the\nground. I let her go. I am a red worm. I blame you for it, Paul-Mason.\nYou and your friends. All of you--except Sears, who is a god with a\nwindow on another world.\"\n\n\"Hush! The world Sears shows you in the microscope is this world,\nPakriaa. He tells you so himself. And I tell you there'll be a new\nway----\"\n\nShe was not listening. Still he saw no threat of brown wings, and no\nlifeboat. But time was a deception; dawn on Lucifer was abrupt on\ncloudless mornings. The battle which had seemed long as heart-break\nhad been a skirmish, a brush of advance parties lasting perhaps ten\nminutes from his first shot to the retreat. Pakriaa's head twitched\nfrom side to side; her eyes were dry. \"I have betrayed Ismar,\nCreator-and-Destroyer-Who-Speaks-Thunder-in-the-Rains----\"\n\n\"Pakriaa----\"\n\n\"My people are to burn me in the pit for the kaksmas with lamp oil. I\nwill order it. I would have been Queen of the World.\" Making no effort\nto escape from his arms, she burst into rage at him; a rage pitiable,\nnot dangerous: \"Why have you come, you sky people, you speakers of new\nwords? We had our life, no need of you. We were brave--you weaken us\nwith words, with words. Your friendship is the green-flower weed that\nkills the self. You make children of us. You break our beautiful image\nof the god and tell us she never lived. You say that now?\" She slashed\nher fingers down her side, drawing blood.\n\nFiring? Firing at the camp?\n\nShe clung to him, wailing: \"And now you carry me. I cannot even hate\nyou. You steal our strength. The priests were right--the\npriests----Ismar, help me! _Ismar!_\"\n\nPaul forced himself into a run. It was firing, rapid and sharp,\npistols and rifles. The ammunition would melt fast at that rate. He\ncould hear yelling. Catching up with the running soldiers, leaving\nthem behind, he could see Mijok, far ahead, swerve to the left.\n\nAnd the lifeboat was in action.\n\nIt curved grandly from near the surface of the lake, which was dim\nwith smoke. It circled over jungle, descended in another swoop at the\ncanoes. Red bodies tumbled overside; the silver nose tilted as if in\ndisdain; the jet spoke for one second, blasting the near canoes into\nnothing, sending up the further ones in yellow fire, driving the\nlifeboat into its seeming-careless leap. But there was still firing\nfrom the gray stone fortress, a human tangle on the beach before it, a\nhigh long screaming.\n\nForward detachments of the lake fleet must have passed in the dark.\nPaul ran on, only his arms remembering Pakriaa. She slipped down,\ngrabbed a spear as her soldiers caught up with her, and ran straight\nfor the beach.\n\nThat part of the agony was almost done. No more boats were coming\nin--Ed Spearman's sky weapon had seen to that. There were more canoes,\nmany more, but they were holding off, grouping clumsily at a distance.\nPaul waited for the lifeboat to slip over him and waved to the south.\nSpearman altered the course of the glide, dropping after one more\ngroup of panicked boats but heading south. A longer burst of the jet,\nand Spearman's weapon lifted, straightened, shot out of sight across\nthe meadow.\n\nPaul could picture the big man's intent and mirthless grin, the cold\ngray eye alert on the fuel gauge. And when this fuel was gone--no\nmore. It might stand for a while, somewhere, a decaying artifact....\n\nThose left alive on the beach were bringing in casualties. The boats\nwere still withdrawing. Christopher Wright was in the fortress with\nthe wounded, his narrow face tight in the misery of a doctor who can\ndo almost nothing. \"Doc--how many have we lost here?\"\n\n\"You! I had almost--Oh, Mijok, what've you got there...? Paul, they\njumped us at first-light. No time even to remind Ed to go after\nyou----\"\n\n\"No, he did right. More needed here. We've stalled the land army, but\nthey'll come on. They have to.\" In the sky the brown dots had appeared\nat last, pouring from their foul rock ledges in the hills. All of them\nwere flying south. \"Pakriaa, look! Lantis has two wars now.\"\n\nShe stood naked and stiff, watching, her underlip thrust out, despair\ngiving way to a glare of satisfaction at the far-off wings, the beasts\nwho ate everything, feared nothing. The southwestern sky was heavy\nwith them. Paul had been right; he sickened at his own cleverness.\n\"How many, Doc?\"\n\n\"Forty or worse. This defense on the beach was by Kamisiaa's people\nand our giant girls--who can shoot.\" Paul saw the golden-furred girl\nLisson smile uneasily at him; there was a sober stare from brown\nTejron. The other two giant women, old Karison and young Elron, seemed\nmore deeply disturbed, Elron studying her rifle as if it were a living\nthing. Wright said, \"With Abro Brodaa's help I made the others stay in\nthe woods where you posted 'em. Surok ran over from the right flank--I\nhad him run back and tell Sears and the rest to sit tight....\nPakriaa\"--Wright strode out to her--\"let me bind that up--you're\nbleeding.\" She permitted it....\n\nThe boats were clustering a quarter mile away. Paul fumbled for his\nfield glasses; they were lost. Little Abroshin Nisana, whom he had\nordered to remain at the fortress, spoke beside him, slowly and\ncarefully because her English was not good: \"Commander, Abro Samiraa\nis return. The plan--good. She crossed the stream, catch them in\nblackness. A few escape. We lose twenty. One was Abro Duriaa--I am not\nknow how she is killed.\" She scuffed her little seven-toed foot in the\ndust; there was nothing alien in her smile. \"Those who return\nTocwright is send west.\" She was puzzled, not disapproving. \"Why are\nwe most strong in the west? The Vestoians follow lake shore.\"\n\nHe said, not quite honestly, \"Their straightest approach to Abro\nPakriaa's village--your village--is in the west. Were there\nprisoners?\"\n\n\"Abro Samiraa is not like to take prisoners. We took not any on the\nbeach. Wrong?\"\n\nHe smothered a sigh of exhaustion. \"It may not matter.\" With Mijok,\nthe stout giantess Tejron was moving among the wounded. Paul noticed a\nheap of torn cloth, all that remained of Earth-made shorts and jackets\nand overalls, ripped for bandages. Wright's idea, no doubt, and good:\nthe pygmies' pounded-bark fabric was a poor second best. _After the\nwar we can go naked--fair enough...._ He saw a pygmy woman shrink from\nTejron's approach; she might be from one of the northern villages, her\nstoicism unequal to accepting the touch of the huge beings she would\nalways have regarded as wild animals. Paul knelt, hoping to reassure\nher, as Tejron eased a bandage around a pierced abdomen. There would\nbe internal bleeding. \"You are from the north?\"\n\nShe looked hurt that he did not know her face. \"I am of Abro Brodaa's\nvillage.\" Then in spite of her shrinking her question was directed at\nTejron: \"Abro Brodaa has say to us--we are all one flesh.\nThat--that----\"\n\nTejron was able to say, \"That is true.\" And while Paul searched for\nother words that might affirm, comfort, explain, the soldier died.\n\nThe only omasha now visible were soaring stragglers. The swarm would\nhave found the army of Lantis--which must and would continue to\nadvance. There was a limit to the gorging of the bat-winged beasts;\nthey too could die on the spears. Meantime the lifeboat was gone, the\nboats were landing, in a moment of darkly sweet quiet which was the\neye of the storm.\n\nPaul checked the giant girl Lisson from firing at the landing party.\n\"Save ammunition.\" He indicated a tall blue-flowered shrub a hundred\nyards out in the meadow. \"We wait at the edge of the woods until they\npass that bush, then charge them. If they break us down here, everyone\nis to fight west, away from the lake--_west_. Now run down the line,\npass on these two orders.\" Lisson sped away, her golden fur bright and\nunstained. \"Doc--get the wounded together, have the other women and\nMijok take them west, beyond Sears' group, well back in the woods. Try\nto find out where Abara's got to with the olifants but send a runner\nback (if there's time)--don't come back yourself. And keep Mijok with\nyou. I don't want him to do any more fighting if we can help it--it's\ntearing him up inside.\"\n\n\"I----\" Wright checked himself, nodded, hurried back into the\nfortress.\n\n\"Pakriaa, Abro Kamisiaa, get your soldiers at the edge of the woods.\"\n\nThey vanished. The meadow was empty of life; the many open eyes on the\nbeach would not see what was to come. Wright's party left the\nenclosure, Mijok carrying the shield. Wright could not look back nor\nwave, for his own arms were full, his head bent in some consoling\nspeech. Paul was striding for the woods when Pakriaa met him and\nmurmured in contempt, \"We hide too, Commander?\"\n\nHe answered out of a moment of black indifference. (_Probably we all\ndie and everything I have done is a mistake._) \"Pakriaa, they may\nbreak easier if they don't see us till we charge.\" She shrugged,\nfollowing him into the obscurity, pointedly ignoring Nisana, who came\nto his other side, perhaps still hating the little captain for her\nindependence of yesterday, when Paul was chosen commander of this\ngrotesque army.\n\nThe Vestoians from the boats were rising out of the grass and coming\nforward. Steadily now, with no more apparent haste than the first\nbreakers leading a destroying wave. It was possible to think with\namazing leisure of the high meadows and wooded roads of New Hampshire.\nPaul's brother had always been a little too fat and fond of ice cream.\nThere was a bookstore in Brattleboro. And the waves of the South China\nSea were moving mountains with snowcaps of foam as they came in on\nLingayen. Why, there was a war there once, more than a hundred years\nago, when the Republic of Oceania was hardly even a thought. Yes: they\ncalled it a Second World War....\n\nThe Vestoians passed the blue shrub. The breaker was red, with a foam\nof white-tipped spears.\n\nPaul was swept into the open, not only by the howling drive of his own\npygmy army, but by the machine within, relentless again, briefly free\nfrom the compromise of thought. He was firing with precision in the\nscant time available before the white-painted bodies crashed into the\nunpainted and churned up a froth of battle.\n\nHe had time to wonder why Nisana was here with him a few yards back of\nthe hand-to-hand frenzy. She was not afraid; her spear was balanced. A\nbreak in the line of fighters let through a Vestoian soldier, dark\nmouth squared in a yell. Nisana's spear widened the mouth to a death\nmask and withdrew. Paul stepped into the breach and sent a few shots\ntoward a trio of green-capped leaders. Something slapped and gouged at\nhis chest--_nothing serious_. But his own fighters to the left of him\nwere going down, outnumbered. He shouted at a brief gleam of Pakriaa's\nface, \"West! Fight _west!_\"\n\nGolden Lisson was running back from her errand, her rifle waving, her\nlips straining in wild laughter. She passed him, trying to bring her\nrifle into use as she ran; it did not fire. A Vestoian was forcing\nNisana away from Paul and beating down her spear. \"Why, damn you!\" The\nVestoian face dissolved in pulp and strangeness under his rifle butt,\nand Paul reeled back, believing for an unbounded second that ghosts\nfrom a place only a few light-years away had swirled across this\nstinking battlefield to shriek at him: \"_Yes! Your people always\nfought that way--the ape picked up a stone...._\" But Nisana was alive;\nNisana was unhurt and alive. He could look up again and see the girl\nLisson also using her rifle as a flail.\n\nShe was between him and the beach. Three pygmies had caught the butt,\nand now she swung them absurdly high; she had almost shaken them off\nwhen a spear pierced her arm and hung there. The rifle dropped. She\nwas down, under the leaping spears and red bodies. She did not even\ncry out again; the golden fur was reddened and defiled. Paul beat his\nway toward her, scarcely seeing what his swinging rifle hit, knowing\nit was too late, forgetting his own order to drive west. Aware too of\nanother tawny shape flashing toward him.\n\nSurok, who had loved Lisson, who would have been her playmate in the\nnext Red-Moon-before-the Rains. Paul tried to stop him--but if any\nsound came out of his own throat it would have been lost against\nSurok's mindless crying. The giant tore into the press around Lisson's\nbody and fell almost at once, crushing a few as he rolled....\n\n\"_West!_ Stay behind my rifle, Nisana---\"\n\nIt had become a methodical insanity like Mijok's, a cutting of red hay\nthat spouted blood. He noticed blood on his right hand too--nothing:\nfront sights of the rifle gouging him. The Vestoians in this direction\nwere thinning out and giving way. He caught up with a white-splashed\nback and bandaged thigh--Pakriaa, ploughing her way west. Abro Samiraa\ndrove across his path in the wrong direction, chasing an isolated\ngroup of three; squat and heavy-faced, she looked happy and more than\nlife-size in the moment of her death, as she took a spear thrust over\nher heart and lay down with the enemy to grin at the sky and cease\nhating.\n\nA rifle barked ahead of him. That could only be Sears Oliphant: Wright\nwould surely follow orders and keep Mijok and the giant women with him\nto protect the wounded.... Abro Brodaa was fighting through to aid\nPakriaa, not yelling, not excited, keeping somehow an air of dreamy\ncontemplation, as if the arms driving her spear and dagger were not\nquite hers. Nisana cried out, \"They are not following! They go\nback----\"\n\nIt was true. Partly true. Here in this patch of bloody meadow there\nwas not much left to fight. The defenders had functioned like a single\norganism, forming a new semicircular line. Behind it was a quiet,\nwhere Pakriaa was gasping, pounding her foot into a body that felt\nnothing.\n\nAnd this dear monster, this fat naked grotesque, panting and smeared\nwith red--this must be Sears Oliphant, late of John Hopkins\nUniversity. The monster smiled in a black beard. \"Few got by, oh my,\nyes. Tamisraa's girls fixed 'em--had to club m' rifle--dirty cave\nman--no fear, Paul--_no fear!_ Muscle man with an empty head. They\nhad--couple bowmen with 'em--no harm done.\" No harm? Was he unaware of\nthe broken arrow shaft below his ribs, deeply bedded, with dark blood\noozing around the wood? \"They quit, Paul?\"\n\n\"They haven't quit.\" He looked south, seeing why they wouldn't quit.\n\n\"Tamisraa got a bad one--throat.\" Sears coughed painfully. \"I sent her\nto Doc--he's just back of those trees. And my pets, Paul, my olifants,\nwhy, they're standing fast, boy. With Abara, bless him--'bout half\nmile north. You can't beat 'em. We must figure some way to ferry 'em\nover to the island--must--they're people, those olifants----\"\n\n\"You go to Doc yourself, Jocko, and fast. That----\"\n\n\"Oh, that, that. Mere prac'l dem'stration nobody loves fat man----\"\n\nThe Vestoians would not quit because of what was coming half a mile\naway in the south under a cloud of brown wings, coming fast. The horde\nwould be ignoring the omasha, striking them aside, spearing them when\nthere was time, granting them the necessary toll for passage, and\ncoming fast. Oh, they would be less than six thousand now--somewhat\nless. Meanwhile the remnant from the boats was waiting, regrouping,\ndrawing breath, readying itself for the climax of massacre, maybe\ndeliberately postponing it until Lantis of Vestoia, Queen of the\nWorld, could arrive to enjoy it. Paul tried again to count his people\nin the sturdy half circle. Black Elis was striding among them, a\ngreat stick in each hand, rumbling comfort and encouragement, and none\nof them shrank away from him.\n\nIt looked like less than seven hundred. A hundred lost at the knoll;\nforty, Wright said, in the first skirmish at the camp; twenty in\nSamiraa's night expedition. Perhaps three hundred in this last wave of\nthe battle. And Samiraa herself; Duriaa; Tamisraa wounded, Pakriaa\ninsane with grief; Lisson and Surok dead. Lame Kamisiaa--Paul could\nnot find her. Abro Brodaa--still calm, unhurt, competent. Very\nwell--seven hundred against somewhat less than six thousand of the\nland army, somewhat less than four thousand from the boats.\n\n_How I dreamed!_ There would be no southward drive to the island. The\nomasha alone made it an absurdity. He had been idiotic to imagine it.\n\nPakriaa broke her spear across her knee. She walked out into the\nmeadow toward the advancing swarm. She looked back stupidly at Paul's\nshout, and Nisana ran to her, crying out in the old language. Pakriaa,\nwith no change of expression, lunged at the captain, striking\nflat-handed across her face, forcing her back until Paul reached them\nto interfere and Sears caught Pakriaa's wrist, mumbling, \"Come\nnow--come with me, princess.\"\n\n\"I am no princess.\"\n\n\"I call you so,\" Sears said clearly, and speaking with sternness for\npossibly the first time in his life. \"Now come with me.\"\n\nPaul stammered, \"Have Doc get that damned arrow out of you. Then he's\nto start north with the wounded--at once.\"\n\n\"North.\" Sears nodded.\n\n\"There are no gods,\" said Pakriaa.\n\n\"Yes, north. We'll catch up with you.\"\n\n\"I thought of you as a god.\"\n\n\"Think of me as a friend who loves you. It is better.\" She went with\nhim, stumbling as Paul had never seen her do, and when the leaves\nclosed behind them it seemed to Paul that there was surely the cloud\nof another world. She might have been a small girl going for a walk in\nthe woods with her grandfather....\n\nThere was no lifeboat above that rolling swarm. Ed Spearman must\nhave----_No time to think about it_.\n\nBut he had to, a little. Spearman was forced down by lack of fuel and\nkilled. Or forced down, isolated somewhere, miles away. Or he had kept\ngood watch of the fuel gauge until there was just enough for another\ntrip to the island and had gone--right, reasonable, what he ought to\nhave done, what Paul would have ordered him to do if he could have....\nPaul turned to Brodaa. \"Your sister Kamisiaa--I don't see her----\"\n\n\"My lame sister is dead.\" Her eyes were shrewd, counting. \"We have\nmore than seven hundred. Two hundred of them bowmen.\"\n\n\"Bring them all to the woods. Spread the bowmen at the edge: they will\nmeet the first charge with arrows, nothing else, and then join our\nretreat. Send a hundred spearwomen to guard and help Tocwright's\ngroup: they will go straight north. Send another hundred through the\nvillages to save what they can--the children, the old--and take them\nwest and north to join the others. All the rest will stay with you and\nme and Elis to fight in the rear--delay and confuse--fighting retreat,\nBrodaa. I see nothing else.\"\n\n\"Nothing else,\" she said evenly. \"As you say....\"\n\nElis was with him, waiting under the trees, and Nisana, who said, \"No\ngods? There must be other gods. Not Ismar....\"\n\nElis watched the meadow over the crouching bowmen. \"Within you,\nCaptain. The god within you made you save the life of my friend. I saw\nthat. I even think I begin to understand. But that might be vanity.\"\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nA sorry day moved into evening, and when evening became an approach to\nmoonless dark, this day of retreat was in Paul's mind a passage of\ndistorted images, true or false.\n\nTrue that he was now limping through forest stillness between Nisana\nand a skinny ghost who was Christopher Wright and Wright carried\nPakriaa, who moaned at times like a child with a nightmare, and up\nahead were five white drifting mountains, one of them ridden by a man\nwho was silent in pain, Sears Oliphant. It might or might not be true\nthat at some time during the day Paul had thrashed on the ground with\na broken head in front of some squalling danger until black arms swept\nhim up away from--whatever it was.\n\nTejron and the two other giant women Karison and Elron, and Mijok,\nstill lived. Elis was walking behind Paul, unhurt; therefore the mind\nof Elis would still be probing at the borderland of known and unknown,\nsearching and incorruptible. All true. Apparently true that the gash\nin Paul's side had stiffened, his right leg was knotting itself in\nsome unimportant distress, and his bandaged forehead no longer\nthrobbed.\n\nThe first contact with the Vestoian land army had been a swift\nskirmish and ordered withdrawal. Abro Brodaa's archers had crumpled\nthe first enemy charge. After that the Vestoians had crashed into the\nwoods with no caution, driven by the horror of brown wings that still\npursued them. Paul had had a final glimpse of the green headdress of\nLantis, Queen of the World; his two shots before the rifle jammed had\nnot touched her. Once, under cover of the trees, the Vestoians had\npaused to reorganize, giving Paul's retreating force a little time\nand distance and the help of forest obscurity.\n\nThe spearwomen sent ahead to clear the villages had poured through\nPakriaa's settlement and Brodaa's, rounding up old people, children,\nand the chattering pack of male witches, sending them west to join\nWright's group of wounded--if they could find it. But at the third\nvillage upstream--it had been Abro Samiraa's--there was delay. Perhaps\nthe people had refused to go where there were giants. Paul's rear\nguard had halted south of the village to protect the evacuation; here\nthe Vestoians caught up with them.\n\nThey had fought it out for two hours in the misery of bush and brier\nand purple vine outside the village ditch, while the jungle world\nsteamed in the growth of mid-morning. Paul's horizon had narrowed to\nthe knot of fighters who stayed with him--Nisana, Brodaa, Elis, an\nunknown black-skirted soldier who fell at his feet with a bleeding\nmouth. Somewhere in that hell he had lost his rifle. It was Brodaa\n(this must be true, for it was Elis who told him of it)--Brodaa who\nhad guided them out of the trap, regrouped the remnant of the rear\nguard north of Samiraa's village while the Vestoians paused to set\nthat village afire and rejoice over its dying.\n\nPaul could remember that regrouping: black Elis had set him on his\nfeet, supporting him till he could walk. There were many twittering,\nmad-eyed bowmen among the survivors. Brodaa had sent runners to give\nthe other three villages a final warning; she herself decided against\ntrying to reach them with this fragment of an army numbering less than\nthree hundred. The only way to save anything at all was to flee north,\njoin Wright's group, hope that the remaining villages would delay the\nconquerors and that at least some of their non-combatants could\nscatter before Lantis, Queen of the World, took them for slaves, meat,\nand sacrifice.\n\nThe rest of the day had been a running, a harsh drive into country\nunknown even to Elis. There had been, for Paul and Elis at least, a\nbreath of second wind when they found the tracks of the olifants. They\nhad caught up with Wright's refugees in the early afternoon, but there\ncould be no pause, even though it was quiet here at the edge of\nforest and western meadow and the sound of screaming in the villages\nwas an hour behind them....\n\nPaul noticed that he was naked except for ammunition belt and an empty\nholster. Perhaps his present clarity of mind was the true madness, the\nearlier fog of pain and anger the mind's more natural climate. But one\nmight as well reason and take stock. He remembered the map. Was it\nsaved? No matter: a copy had been flown to the island with Dorothy and\nthe baby.\n\n_I have a woman who loves me; I have a daughter. I have my life._\n\nOn his left, just visible in twilight beyond a meadow turning\nbrilliant with blue fireflies, there were the low western hills, the\nhills rotten with the burrows of kaksmas, and they were nearer, much\nnearer than he had ever seen them except from the lifeboat. (_But Ed\nSpearman went there; he walked in the hills alone and found iron ore,\nand now he is----Never mind where he is. If the charlesite was giving\nout he did right to fly to the island and abandon us. What else could\nhe do?_) Well, it was right too that the hills should be nearer: the\nedge of the forest slanted northwest, narrowing the meadow. And this\nfar north the hills were smaller, more broken up. Yet it would not do\nto approach them closely: even the least of the hills (so pygmy and\ngiant tradition said) could be the dwelling place of day-blind ratlike\nkillers numerous enough to destroy this entire party and still be\nhungry. The retreat must struggle north until the hills were well\nbehind, shut away by level jungle--where the kaksmas still might come,\nto be sure, but only to the distance of half a night's journey from\ntheir burrows. \"Doc--can you estimate what distance we've made since\nwe caught up with you?\"\n\n\"Maybe twenty miles,\" the old man said. \"In more time than _Argo_ once\nneeded to travel twenty million miles. What is man?\"\n\n\"Man? A mathematical absurdity.... Aren't you tired? I could carry\nPakriaa a while.\"\n\n\"No, I'm not tired, son. I like to have her....\"\n\nRifles--in the beginning there had been only five, and one shotgun.\nThe shotgun had been taken to the island. Dorothy and Ann had their\npistols there, too. Paul's rifle was lost. Lisson's had been lost when\nshe died. That should leave three. Wright had one slung at his back.\nPeering up ahead, Paul saw another in the red-brown hand of the young\ngiantess Elron. Sears must have lost his. So two at least remained.\nAnd one automatic--Wright's. \"Those two new recruits Mijok\nbrought----I'm in a fog--I only just remembered----\"\n\n\"Lost,\" said Wright, staring ahead. \"The boy didn't understand. He ran\ninto the mess on the beach like a horse running into a fire. That was\nbefore you got back from the south. The other had more sense. Saw the\npygmies spilling out of the boats and ran for the woods. Naturally we\ndidn't try to hold him. Perhaps he's reached his home territory. I\nhope so.\"\n\nBehind him Elis spoke softly: \"It was not very far, Doc. When we reach\nthe island and start the new settlement----\"\n\n\"Oh, Elis----\"\n\n\"When that has been done I'll come back and find him, give him the\nwords--him and many others. I promise you that. Let me believe it.\"\n\n\"Believe it, Elis. But the boy Danik is dead. He was bright, curious.\nHe should have lived 150 years.\"\n\n\"We overtake mystery,\" Elis said, \"and leave it behind.\"\n\n\"Men have never overtaken the mystery of untimely death.\"\n\n\"There is chaos,\" said Elis. \"Chance. Mystery is great jungle around a\nsmall clearing. I accept that. We make a wider clearing.\"\n\nPaul felt Nisana's finger hook over his. Pakriaa groaned, perhaps in\nsleep. The darkness had blotted away the hills; even the small shape\nof Nisana was growing too dim. Elis said, \"You're limping, Paul.\nAbroshin Nisana is tired. There are still three of the animals without\nriders. You and Doc----\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Wright said. \"We might make better time.\" Nisana trilled an\norder to Abara, who rode the colossal bulk of Mister Johnson at the\nhead of the line. The animals halted without sound. \"We must go on all\nnight, Paul--right? What became of your--prisoner?\"\n\n\"My----\" the mental clarity must be a fraud, Paul thought, if new\nmemories could flash into it so abruptly. At some time--it must have\nbeen after Elis had carried him clear of the nightmare at Samiraa's\nvillage--he had stumbled on a Vestoian soldier unconscious from a head\nwound and loss of blood but not dead. He had still been carrying her\nwhen they caught up with Wright. With this, the memory of that reunion\nbecame whole--the wordless suffering on the shield that Mijok carried,\nthe improvised stretchers, the bewilderment and exhaustion in the red\nfaces, the very smell of defeat--with this also a picture of the\nhorribly fat witch from Pakriaa's village carried on a litter by two\nspearwomen, and one other witch, a lank skeleton with white and purple\nlines emphasizing the prominence of his ribs, striding beside his\ncolleague and shooting glances of wrath from left to right and back.\nSomeone had gently taken the unconscious soldier. \"She's safe, Doc.\nTejron took her--still has her, I'm sure.\"\n\n\"Good.\" Wright added with a harshness canceling humor: \"Now if only\nfriend Lantis will initial a copy of the Geneva Convention....\" He was\nfumbling in the twilight before one of the white beasts, uncertain\nwhat to do.\n\nThe old cow olifant Susie, carrying Sears, fretted at the delay,\nsampling the air and rumbling. Paul petted her trunk to soothe her;\nSears' voice came down to him: \"Paul? Take this, will you?\" He was\nreaching down the case that held his microscope, safe somehow out of\nthe inferno of the day. \"My grip's not too good, got nothing to tie it\nto--bare's a baby's bottom, like you. We look like the last days of a\nTurkish bath, hey?\"\n\n\"How d'you feel?\" Nisana tore shreds from what remained of her purple\nskirt; she looped them about the case, fastened it to Paul's\nammunition belt.\n\n\"Feel good,\" Sears said. Each word was a thick struggle for normal\nspeech. \"Arrowhead came off; Chris got it out. Manicure scissors for\nforceps; you may slice me cross-ways and call me ham and eggs if it\nain't so. Right, Chris? You there?\"\n\n\"I'm here, Jocko,\" Wright said, and under his breath to Paul: \"Medical\nkit lost. I don't think the spleen is injured, but----\" Aloud he said,\n\"Of course, with your gut what I needed was a hook and line. Paul, how\ndo you make one of these ten-foot roller coasters kneel down?\"\n\n\"Let me--that's Miss Ponsonby--she knows me.\" At Paul's order, tons of\ngentleness knelt on the earth; Paul held Pakriaa while Wright\nstruggled into the hollow between hump and head, and Pakriaa was\neither asleep or not caring.... \"Abro Brodaa?\"\n\n\"Here, Commander.\"\n\n\"Form your people in three lines with linked hands. The giant women\nKarison and Elron, and Elis, will guide them at the head, because\ntheir night vision is better than yours and mine. Mijok and Tejron\nwill walk beside us. We must travel all night. I think the Vestoians\nwill not.\"\n\n\"They will not,\" the princess Brodaa said. He wished he could see\ntruly what was happening in her little face. \"They will not because\nthey have no giants or Charins to help them.\" It carried no hint of\nthe obsequious.\n\n\"Thank you, Abro Brodaa. Wait here a moment.\" He patted Millie's\ntrunk--she was a young beast, nervous but fond of him--and made her\nkneel. \"Help Nisana climb up to me.... Abro Brodaa--the people of your\nvillage----\"\n\n\"Most of them lost.\" It might have been the oncoming night itself\nspeaking temperately. \"These remaining are a few from all the\nvillages. I think they will follow me. And I will go with you....\"\n\nIn the rest of the night--a silence and a drifting, on the surge and\nthrust of the great animal under him--it was possible to reach a kind\nof sleep, knowing his body would not relax enough to fall or to weaken\nhis hold on Nisana, who trusted him. She was deeply asleep in the\nfirst part of the night, occasionally snoring, a comic noise like a\npuppy's whine. All day she had never been out of his sight; she had\nfought like a hellcat, but singlemindedly, saving her strength to deal\nwith those who threatened him.\n\nIt would have been possible to abandon these people; at one time, Paul\nremembered, he had almost favored it himself, and Ed Spearman had very\nnearly hinted that it might be better to join forces with the tyranny\nin the south.... Life seemed cheap to Pakriaa's tribe--others' life.\nDevil-worshipping cannibals, capable of every cruelty, committed for\nthousands of years to all the superstitions that ever crippled\nintelligence. You had to look beyond that, said Christopher Wright the\ntheorist, the doctor, the anthropologist, the impractical daydreamer.\n_Anyway I saved a Vestoian--if she lives. One balanced against how\nmany that I destroyed...? No answer.... Unless you can see a world\nwhere the ways of destruction become obsolete under a government of\nlaws. With the devils of human nature--the vanities, the greeds, the\nfollies and needless resentments, the fear of self-knowledge, dread of\nthe unfamiliar, the power lust of the morally blind, the passion for\neasy solutions, scapegoats, panaceas--how do you see such a world...?\nYou say, Christopher Wright, that no one is expendable. I believe you.\nBut--when I must choose between the life of myself or my friends and\nthe life of the one whom the stream of history has tossed against me\nas my enemy----_\n\n_When I do that, I only discover once more that I am caught in the\nsame net with the rest of my kind and cannot escape until all of them\nescape--escape into a region of living where men do not set traps for\neach other and the blind do not lead._\n\n_Therefore----_\n\n\"Are you awake, Nisana?\" Her even breathing quickened. It seemed to\nPaul that there was faint color in his glimpses of sky; he remembered\nthe silver moon that had appeared over the jungle with first-light so\nlong ago--yesterday morning. The passage of the red moon around\nLucifer was swift: tonight it would be rising two hours before\nfirst-light and would be something broader than the gory scimitar he\nhad seen from the knoll.\n\n\"I am awake.\"\n\n\"I think the red moon has come back.\"\n\n\"Yes.\" She pointed over his shoulder; he glimpsed it through a gap in\nthe leaves. \"A good moon. Begins the Moon of Little Rains. The small\nrains make no harm, make the ground sweet. Is better than the moon\npast--that we call the Moon of Beginnings.\" She moved restlessly\nagainst him. \"This country--all forest? How long have I sleep?\"\n\n\"Most of the night. We're past the open land.\"\n\nShe whispered, \"No one has ever come here. We have think always there\nare bad--what word?--tev--tevils in the north.\"\n\n\"Tomorrow--rather, today--we turn west and then south on the other\nside of the hills, to the island.\"\n\n\"Ah, the island.... I cannot see this island.\"\n\n\"You'll like it, Nisana. You'll be happy there.\"\n\n\"Happy?\" And he remembered that the old pygmy language had no word for\nhappiness.\n\nWright's voice came thinly in the dark: \"Abara, stop them! Sears----\"\n\nMillie halted and knelt without an order: Nisana jumped down. Paul saw\nthe shapes of Elis and Sears suddenly bright under Wright's\nflashlight--the only radion light left. \"Easy,\" Elis said. \"I have\nyou.\" And he lowered the man's bulk to the ground as Susie moaned and\nshifted her feet. Sears had said nothing, but he was smiling, his face\nred and vague above the disorder of the black beard.\n\n\"Paul, hold the light for me.\" Wright removed the stained bandage.\nThere was a wide area of inflammation; the lips of the arrow wound\nwere purple. \"Pakriaa! You said once you never heard of poison on the\narrows----\"\n\nPakriaa gaped, rubbing her eyes. It was Brodaa who answered: \"Our\npeople never had it on the arrows. But in the war with Lantis last\nyear some of our soldiers had wounds like this.\"\n\n\"And what happened?\"\n\n\"Ismar--\" Pakriaa stumbled forward. \"Ismar took----\"\n\n\"My sister,\" said Brodaa, \"be quiet, my sister.\"\n\n\"Elis,\" Paul whispered, \"have Tejron and the other women keep\nwatch--we must stay here a while. Where is Mijok?\"\n\n\"Here.\" Mijok spoke behind him. \"I have put my shield--over there.\"\nHis voice became a whisper for Paul: \"There are only three on it now.\nOne little man, two women. They might live. Paul--is it happening,\nPaul?\"\n\n\"I can't say it. I don't know....\" Sears was talking, ramblingly, very\nfar from this patch of earth. One could only listen till he was\nsilent. Then Paul said, \"I think so, Mijok. He needs to speak; we need\nto remember.\"\n\n\"What is this--Tel Aviv----\"\n\n\"The place on the other planet where he was born.\"\n\n\"And there were the vineyards, oh my, yes--the little white and tan\ngoats----\" Sears could see it, Paul thought, that small country, a\nquiet corner of the Federation, where every grain of sand might\nremember blood spilled in the follies of hatred, where a teacher of\nmercy had been crucified. But now for Sears it was not a place of\nhistory: he saw gardens defying wasteland, the homes and farms,\ncenters of music and learning where he moved, thoroughly at home,\ndiscovering the country of his own science, himself a citizen of no\none place except the universe. Later he was recalling the hot white\nstreets of Rio, the genial clutter of London, Baltimore, the majestic\ncontradictions of New York.\n\n\"Why, yes, Doctor,\" he said--and he did not mean Christopher Wright,\nbut some friend or instructor whose image might be standing in front\nof the shadows of Lucifer, \"yes, Doctor, you could say I've traveled a\ngreat deal, in my sort of blundering fashion. And I would not exactly\nsay that people are the same everywhere, but you'll have noticed\nyourself--the many common denominators are much more interesting than\nthe seeming-great differences, aren't they, hey...? What? Sorry,\nDoctor, I've got no damned use for your abstraction Man, and why?\nBecause he doesn't exist, except as a device in a brain that wants to\nprove something--which may or may not be useful. In any case it's not\nmy dish. There are only men and women. They get born and love and\nsuffer and work and grow old and die; or sometimes, Doctor, they die\nyoung. Men and women I can love and touch; sometimes I can even teach\nthem the few things I know. You may take Man to the library; feed him\nback into your electronic brain and don't bother me with the results\nso long as I'm alive to see a child discovering his own body--or for\nthat matter a bird coming out of the egg, a minnow in a spot of\nsunlight, a blade of grass.\"\n\nPakriaa wailed: \"What is he saying? He is not here.\" She squirmed past\nWright, dropped to the ground, her cheek pressed on Sears' tangled\nhair, her free arm wandering over his face and shoulder as if she\nwanted to cover him like a shield. \"He talked to me once. Sears, you\nsaid--you said----\"\n\nHe was back among them, gazing around in sane bewilderment. \"I should\nbe riding.... Pakriaa--why Pak, I'm all right.\" Paul moved the torch\nhere and there to pick out his own face, Wright's, Mijok's, the white\nbulk of Susie looming close by, the pouting ugly mask of Abara, who\nhad stolen up close, his underlip wobbling in an effort to speak. \"I\nfell asleep--took a tumble?\"\n\n\"Almost,\" Wright muttered. \"Just lucky chance I saw you tottering. You\nneed to rest a bit.\"\n\n\"Oh no.\" Sears frowned. \"Can't stop.\" He smiled at Pakriaa, who had\nlifted herself to watch him pleadingly. \"What's the matter, Pakriaa?\nWhat's the time?\"\n\n\"First-light before long,\" Paul said. \"We made good distance, Jocko.\nThe Vestoians won't have traveled in the dark. Plenty of time and we\nall need rest. Take it easy a while.\"\n\nBut Pakriaa could not hide her knowledge that he was dying; Sears\ntouched her cheek with a curious wandering finger. \"You liked looking\nin the microscope, didn't you?\" She nodded. \"Remember--must be sure\nyou've got the best focus you can before you make up your mind about\nanything. But this is more serious, Pak--because I think you love me\nand you have trouble. I tell you again, you must go to the island with\nthe others. You must live. Now I expect to go there too, but--\"\n\nAbara moved away. Paul glimpsed him striding back and forth, striking\nthe air with little fists. When he returned, Paul made way for him.\n\n\"--for a teaching is a gift, Pakriaa, not to be thrown away--\"\n\nAbara stammered. \"You have talk to me too, Sears--\"\n\n\"Why, to all of you. Certainly to you, Abara.... What's the profit of\nany effort if the result is thrown away in a time of weakness? You\ndiscard only if what you have is proven false. We haven't much--we\nnever have much. Some things appear to be empirically certain. Not\nmany.... You know, I believe I've given a few people--call it a\nwakening of curiosity. I think that's good. Curiosity and patience.\nGood as far as it goes. I'm not ashamed.\" He was trying to see\nWright's gaunt face. \"You picked a tougher subject, didn't you, Chris?\nDon't worry--give you an A for something more than effort.... Now\nlook, this hanging around here won't do.\" He caught Paul's hand and\nheaved himself upright. \"I remember--map--damn it. Need another whole\nday before we pass the hills. Susie--down, Susie--\"\n\nBut Susie, fumbling at him with her trunk, would not kneel. Paul heard\nMijok's agonized whisper: \"She knows.\"\n\nSears laughed. \"All right, make the old man climb.\" And before anyone\ncould stop him he had tottered a few steps and burned out the last of\nhis strength in a heaving jump toward her neck, which barely lifted\nhim from the ground and dropped him at Paul's feet. Groping for him,\nPaul saw that he was dead, saw also, above the arching of the trees, a\nlucid cruelty of morning.\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nTwice that day Elis dropped far behind to listen and reported there\nwas no pursuit. It was hard to judge their distance from the foothills\nof the western range, for now there was no open ground--only Wright's\ncompass, the memory of the map, and treetop surveys that Mijok made\nfrom time to time. Abara rode Mister Johnson in the lead, making the\nbeasts travel slowly since the pygmies were faint with weariness.\nSusie trailed forlornly; she had not been willing to abandon the grave\ntill the others went on without her.\n\nThe pygmies carried only half a dozen makeshift stretchers; the number\nof unwounded had diminished too. \"They slip away,\" Brodaa said to\nPaul. He saw three men carrying children too small to walk; no old\nwomen. The fat witch rode his litter, unconcerned at the fatigue of\nits bearers; the other old man, smeared with white and purple paint,\nstalked beside him. Brodaa said, \"My sister Tamisraa ended life with\nthe white-stone dagger. While Elis and Mijok made the--what\nword?--grave. We left her body looking north to help the spirit\njourney. There are many lost who will have no prayers--bad--they may\nfollow us. What is this--burial, Paul-Mason?\"\n\n\"A Charin custom. Most of us believe the spirit dies with the body:\ndifferent parts of the same thing.\"\n\n\"Ah?\" She did not seem shocked. \"Maybe true for your people.\"\n\n\"We live in others,\" Paul said. \"Sears lives so long as we remember\nhim. That will be always....\" It seemed to Paul there were scarcely a\nhundred in this worn line. \"We mustn't try to hold them if they want\nto go. If you, Brodaa, or any others want to leave us, you know you\nare free.\"\n\nHer answer was firm and considered: \"I will not leave you....\"\n\nWright had not spoken since the burial, nor had Pakriaa. They kept\ntogether; Paul was with them sometimes. Behind them Mijok carried his\nshield. It was Elis who heard the bleat of asonis and stole off to\nbring back meat for an afternoon meal. It was Elis, before that, who\nsaid, \"We have done what we could, Paul. We could not have made these\npeople retreat in time to save themselves. If we had abandoned them\nLantis would have left no more than a fire leaves in the\nRed-Moon-of-Dry-Days. Pakriaa is too sick to understand that, yet. She\ncarries a grief like a little one swelling in the womb: it must grow\ngreater before she is delivered of it.\"\n\nIn the afternoon halt, it was Elis who tried to make Wright eat\nsomething and sleep, but Wright could do neither.\n\nThe giant women Elron and Karison also refused the meat. They sat\napart with stout brown Tejron. She was eating, keeping close to her\nthe still unconscious Vestoian, whom the pygmies had given no more\nthan disgusted glares. Tejron might be listening to Karison's\nundertone--it was in the monosyllables of the old language. The girl\nElron held her eyes downcast, fondling the rifle. She and Karison had\nbeen much together in a peculiar loneliness since the children were\nflown to the island: Karison was old, her children grown and gone away\nbefore the Charins came; Elron was too young to have given birth.\nThree of the children at the island were Tejron's; the others were\nchildren of Muson and Samis and of a mother who had died in the old\nlife. Tejron wiped her lips and grunted impatiently; she took up her\ncharge in careful arms and left the two. Paul sensed what was to come\nwhen Elron set her cherished rifle at his feet. Karison approached\nWright, humble but determined: \"We must leave you.\"\n\nBefore Wright could speak, Mijok answered her with a sullen anger Paul\nhad never heard from him: \"I brought you from the jungle with empty\nheads. We gave you the words, the beginning of the laws we must make\ntogether. You lived like the uskaran, furtive and cruel--\"\n\n\"No,\" Wright said. \"Mijok, no....\"\n\nKarison had winced, but she repeated: \"We must go. The old way--we\nneed it.\"\n\n\"Then you must go,\" Wright said, his spread fingers white-nailed on\nthe ground. \"And remember always that you go with our good will.\"\n\n\"That is so.\" She was torn two ways. \"But the old life--\"\n\nElis rumbled: \"Elron, come here.\" The girl would not. \"I hoped that in\nthe next Red-Moon-before-the-Rains--\"\n\nShe muttered, \"When the change comes you will return to us--\"\n\nElis laughed, roaring at her, \"You're a fool, a child!\" The harshness,\nPaul knew, was calculated, in the hope of changing her mind by shaming\nher. \"You think the old life was a freedom. Freedom to live like an\nanimal without an animal's peace, Elron, because of the thing in you\nthat struggles for knowledge--oh yes, in spite of yourself, and\nalways. Freedom to hunt all day or else sleep on an empty stomach,\njump with fear at every creaking branch. Freedom to cram yourself with\nmoss root and slugs from the streams--never enough--in the bad moons\nwhen the asonis go north. Freedom to kill the pygmies and be hunted by\nthem, never an end to it--that's your freedom without the laws,\nwithout the words. No, so long as you're a fool I don't want you.\" She\nturned away, speechless; he shouted after her in a different voice,\n\"He said you go with our good will. That is true. You can't forget us,\nElron. You're not the wild thing Mijok brought out of the woods.\nYou'll feel us pulling you back--you feel it now--and you will come\nback.\" But she was gone in the shadows, Karison following her, and\nElis rubbed his broad forehead on his arms.\n\nWright whispered, \"If they wanted it--it had to be so.\"\n\nElis waited for his angry breathing to calm. \"Mijok, do you remember?\nIn the old days I couldn't even have been your friend. Remember how\nangry _I_ was--only a year ago? You stepping over the border of my\nterritory, telling me--I've wondered how you did it with our few\nstumbling words--telling me every being should be free to go as he\npleased anywhere in the world? You were in danger, Mijok. I am older,\nbigger, heavier--I nearly went for your throat. Long ago. So--don't be\nangry with these two.\"\n\nTejron sat by Wright, holding the Vestoian like a nursing baby.\n\"Maybe,\" she said, \"maybe they will take some of what you teach us to\nothers. Maybe it will be like the thing you showed us, how a little\nseed no bigger than the eye of illuama can become a tree....\"\n\nPakriaa had watched indifferently; Paul hoped he was right, that her\nface was not quite so tightly set in lines of rejection and despair.\nWright came stiffly to his feet, a hand on Tejron's shoulder, the\nother wandering into his gray beard. \"Abro Brodaa, interpret for\nme--some of them have no English. Tell them we turn west soon, then\nsouth through bad country--swamp, heat, uskaran, marsh reptiles maybe,\nmaybe the kaksmas swarm on the west side of the hills. Tell them we go\nthrough that. When we reach a river we have seen from the air--it has\nno falls and flows southwest--we shall make boats.\"\n\nBrodaa put it into the high music of the pygmy tongue. Paul could see\nno change in the saddened faces; by rumor, most of them would already\nknow this much. But the thin witch was muttering to his gross\ncolleague, and some soldier faces turned to overhear that instead of\nattending to Brodaa.\n\n\"Tell them, Brodaa, this river will take us to Big-Water. We go south\nalong the coast, to the island where our friends are, where we believe\nSpearman has gone in the winged boat. Tell them, on this island there\nare no kaksmas, the omasha never come, nor the lake boats of Lantis.\nThere is game, good ground, room for all. Tell them--No, wait.... Oh,\nBrodaa, tell them in your own way that we hope to live there in\npeace.\"\n\nThe lean witch interrupted Brodaa's translation with a wailing\ndiatribe, twitching his twigs of arms, lashing the battered soldiers\nwith his oratory. Brodaa turned to Wright in misery: \"He says--he saw\nIsmar change Spearman back to a marsh lizard and the boat to an\nomasha.\"\n\nMijok laughed savagely. \"When did he see that? Ask him.\"\n\nBrodaa did, on a thin shout. The scarecrow flashed her a glare of\nresentment and a snapping answer.... \"He says he saw it in sleep\npicture.\"\n\nPaul snarled, \"Yes, a dream's as near as he came to a battlefield.\"\n\nBrodaa was shocked, but Nisana laughed. The fat witch on the litter was\nfuming. Coming from Pakriaa's village, he probably had enough English to\nunderstand it; he leaned forward, embracing his hideous belly, croaking at\nthe soldiers. Nisana translated in swift whispers: \"Says--you Charins all\nmarsh lizards, changed by Inkar-Goddess-of-Kaksmas.... Says we lose to\nVestoians because image was broke; Ismar punishes.... Will I kill him,\nPaul-Mason?\"\n\nBrodaa choked: \"You cannot touch Amisura. Your spear will turn--\"\n\n\"My spear is lost,\" said Nisana, loudly enough for all to hear. \"But\nAksona, Amana, two other men of magic--those I saw killed at Abro\nSamiraa's village. Vestoian spears was not turn in the hand--I saw.\"\nShe stepped forward, fingering her white-stone knife, and the fat\nAmisura cringed, squeaking.\n\nWright cried, \"I forbid it, Nisana. Let them go. Brodaa!\"\n\nBrodaa said quickly, \"He asks sacrifice--you, Paul, Pakriaa--\"\n\nNisana laughed again. She dropped her white-stone dagger on the ground\nand slapped the thin witch in the face. The crowd gasped and shrank\nback. Such a man, Paul knew, was altogether holy, never to be touched;\none must not even look him in the eye. But Nisana slapped him again\nand shoved him sprawling. She caught a pole of Amisura's litter,\nheaved at it, and he tumbled like a red melon. \"_Now_ let them\nchoose!\" She came back to Paul with grin and swagger, patting her\nscarred chest. \"I am little Spearman. I break images too.\"\n\nAnd the pygmies were choosing, not as she or the witches had\nhoped--choosing headlong retreat from this sacrilege, dissolving away\ninto the forest with sick-eyed backward looks. Paul saw Amisura\nweeping, humping pitiably back to his litter on all fours, and heard\nPakriaa laugh. The two soldiers who had carried Amisura brought the\nlitter nearer, not daring to touch him; when he flopped on it they\nbore him away. The other witch had run blindly, covering his insulted\nface, and Wright said like a machine, \"Let them go--let them--\"\n\nSardonically, Pakriaa had watched the whole incident without rising;\nnow she seemed to want to catch Wright's eye, lifting a skinny\nshoulder as if to say: \"What can you do with fools?\"\n\nWhen the panic was over, thirty followers remained....\n\nIn the early evening Mijok reported, after another treetop survey,\nthat the last of the kaksma hills was about three miles southwest.\nWest of them the jungle was level; it was time to turn. Elis had\nslipped away and returned with two heavy carcasses like wild boars.\nSears had named these stodgy animals pigmors. The _mor_ suffix, he had\ninsisted, was an intensely scientific shorthand for \"more or less,\ndamn it.\" The meat was high-flavored and coarse but safe.... Hearing\nMijok's news, Brodaa sighed, thinking perhaps of the long history of\nher people, the groping for a narrow path of survival among endless\nperils. \"We say the great uskaran hears a leaf fall to earth from a\nthousand paces away but the kaksma hears the leaf divide the air as it\nfalls. Oh--three of your Charin miles, that is great length. Maybe\nenough.\"\n\nThe tremendous sheer spires of the coastal range, Mijok said, were\nvisible in the southwest though nearly a hundred miles off; it would\nbe a clear sweet night, he thought, with no clouds and many stars.\nThey should go at least fifteen miles due west; then the course would\nbe southwest rather than south, to miss the hills....\n\nIn the crowding darkness Mister Johnson's leading was again a thing of\nwisdom; his lifted trunk and sensitive eyes avoided dense growth and\ndrooping vines that could endanger the riders. From each necessary\ndetour he came back willingly to the course, under guidance of Abara's\nsense of compass direction, and the other four followed him as the arm\nfollows the hand. Tonight Paul rode old Susie--she seemed to feel\nhappier for it--carrying Nisana again; Wright was on Miss Ponsonby,\nwith Pakriaa. Tejron, unfamiliar with the beasts but ready to learn,\nhad climbed on Millie's back and kept her balance without trouble,\nholding the wounded Vestoian, who stirred and whimpered but was not\ntruly conscious. Behind Paul was the more nervous bull Mister Smith\nwithout a rider, and Elis and Mijok walked beside him, Mijok with his\nshield, Elis holding Brodaa's hand. The thirty who had dared to choose\nthe forbidden unknown trailed behind Brodaa with linked fingers, nine\nbowmen among them; there were few weapons, no wounded except on\nMijok's shield, and this held only two, for one of the women had died.\nThe wounded archer was yellow-faced with loss of blood from a hip\ninjury, but that was clean and closed; he was free from the signs of\nfear, almost cheerful. The woman was a sturdy black-skirted soldier of\nthe ranks, gashed in the face and with a leg torn from knee to ankle.\n\nAnother night of silence and of drifting--for a while. Wright's voice\nfloated back: \"I am thinking of Dorothy and Ann, and your daughter.\"\n\n\"And not of Ed Spearman?\"\n\n\"Oh.... The fuel must have been getting low, Paul. Nothing the boat\ncould do for us after we were back in the woods. He must be at the\nisland.\"\n\nPaul could only say, \"I hope so.\" The thing Spearman had almost said\nwhen his anger and disappointment were high, the hint at joining\nforces with Lantis in abandonment of everything thus far\nachieved--nothing could be gained by speaking of that now. But some of\nSpearman's words murmured on in darkness: \"_Lantis--terrific\norganization ... monetary system ... whole world for the taking ...\npretty idealism that never worked even on Earth...._\"\n\nThere had always been strain and mutual exasperation in argument with\nEd Spearman--long ago, on the ship _Argo_. The Collectivist Party,\nsurviving as an innocuous political group after the horrors of the\nCivil War of 2010-13, lived strongly in Spearman's mind, not only\nbecause his father had fought for it. Lacking the frenzied dogmatism\nof the antique communism it resembled, it was nevertheless communism's\nnatural heir, a party of iron doctrines simplified for minds that\nresented analysis and magnified Man out of a dislike for men. Like\ncommunism, it needed to imagine a class war and felt that it had a\ntight vested monopoly of the underdog. The C.P., said one of its late\ntwentieth-century prophets as humorless as his predecessors, \"believed\nin Man.\" You could always fluster a collectivist by asking for a\nlogical breakdown of that--and make an enemy: they were usually good\nhaters and made a virtue of it. The years following the Civil War had\nbeen troubled though materially prosperous, darkened by the build-up\nof yet another monolithic state under Jenga the Mongol, who had\ninherited the desolation of the Russo-Chinese war of 1970-76; in those\nyears the Collectivist Party in the Federation, unsupported by any\nconveniently foreign deity, had become not much more than a\nserio-comic decayed socialism with a dash of bitters. But it was\nalive; at the time _Argo_ left the spaceport it had had ten senators\nand a larger handful of delegates in the Federation Congress. It was\nrespectable, no longer subversive, and owned a small hard core of the\naggressively sincere.... Not Wright nor Sears nor anyone had ever been\nable to convince Edmund Spearman that evil means breed a further evil,\nwhich swallows up any good that may have been imagined in the\nbeginning. Spearman could admit that (himself in no way an evil man)\nhe would not do evil--if he could help it. But in the region of theory\nSpearman held quite simply that you can't make an omelette without\nbreaking eggs, and that settled it....\n\n\"They should be safe,\" Wright said. \"You and Jocko saw the island.\"\n\n\"It's beautiful. I know they're all right.\"\n\n\"Yes.... Would you say it was a place where Ann might--oh, how shall I\nsay it?--might attain tranquillity? Not cry too much for the moon?\"\n\n\"If there is any such place in the Galaxy.\"\n\n\"Time,\" Elis said. \"Little Black-Hair needs time. She is like grass I\nhave seen growing in too much shade. She is not like our Mashana\nDorothy who will make sunshine if the other sun is clouded.\"\n\n\"Listen!\" Brodaa's voice. \"Listen....\"\n\nPaul heard nothing, at first. Up ahead Abara sputtered: \"Mister\nJohnson--hoo-hee--be quiet. Is nothing--be quiet--\"\n\nNisana came broad awake in Paul's arms. Wright's mount halted, as did\nSusie, but Susie was trembling, raising and swinging her head in a way\nto make balance difficult; Paul saw the white writhing of her trunk\nlifted to explore for a scent.... He heard it then: a long rustling,\nlike a repeated tearing of paper behind a closed door; nothing\nelse.... A wet howl from Mister Johnson sent a spasm through Susie's\nmass; her muscles bunched; Abara's voice wailed back: \"Mister Joh--I\ncannot hold him--_kaksmas_!\"\n\nTransition from realization to stampede was a flash like the pain of a\nblow. Paul heard Mijok: \"My shield--it will hold more.\" Elis cried\nsomething to Brodaa. Then Susie had plunged ahead, uncontrollable;\nPaul could only bend low above the clinging of Nisana, hold on with\nhands and knees, hope that no trailing vine or branch would sweep them\noff into death. Mister Johnson could make no careful choice of a trail\nnow--he would be parting the jungle like a six-ton bullet. \"Don't be\nafraid, Nisana--we can outrun them--\"\n\n\"My people--\"\n\n\"Elis and Mijok can outrun them too. They'll carry all they can.\" In\nspite of the agony of mere hanging on, mere straining to stay alive,\nhe had to think: _They were loyal and we got them into this...._\nBranches slashed across his back, stinging and scraping. Once Susie\nstumbled and recovered as the group went splattering across some\ninvisible mud, and Paul wondered if Mister Johnson in his terror would\nrun them into quicksand or marsh.\n\nThat ended; there was more thick jungle whipping his back for--five\nminutes?--an hour...? This too ended.\n\nCrazed or purposeful, the beasts charged out into open land through a\nsoft roaring of torn grass. Paul could twist his head to glance upward\nat a field of stars. He could not win a backward look for Elis and\nMijok: his neck and arm muscles were stiffened in his grasp of Susie's\nears, and he dared not risk disturbing Nisana's clutch of him. But to\nleft and right he could make out other shapes under starlight and hear\na frantic thudding of hoofs--fleeing asonis, other innocent woodland\ncattle with a hunger to live. Once he glimpsed a long-bodied thing\npass off to the left in wild leaps lifting it above the grass tops:\nuskaran, he thought, the huge tiger cat, no enemy but a brother in\npanic.\n\nThe open ground ended at water; here at last the olifants slowed to a\nhalt, unlike the lesser desperate brutes, for Mister Johnson was still\nwise, considering the stream, aware of his leadership. Paul could\nshout to the others now, and they all answered. But his backward\nstaring found only the stars, the white mass of Mister Smith, the\ndisturbed darkness that must be meadow. \"Elis! Mijok!\"\n\nNo answer could have reached him above the bleating and thunder of\nterrorized harmless things crossing the field and hurtling blindly\ninto the river. Mister Johnson was wading in deliberately. There was\nsplashing at first, then silence, as cool water came up around Paul's\nknees and Susie's motion changed to a smooth throbbing and heaving; he\nsaw small foam where the curve of her lifted trunk cut the water. He\nwhispered to Nisana, \"We're safe, dear. Big river. Kaksmas won't cross\nit....\" Mister Johnson was leading them in an upstream slant, bearing\nwell to the right while the bobbing frantic heads of other creatures\nlet the moderate current press them away to the left. This\nway--whether by Mister Johnson's wisdom or Abara's guidance--they\nmight be able to come ashore clear of the dangerous passage of the\nstampede.\n\n\"My people cannot go through the water. We never--\"\n\n\"Elis and Mijok can swim. They'll get them across somehow. Maybe the\nshield will float, Nisana.\"\n\nThe madness behind them dwindled into the faraway. In growing quiet,\nWright's voice came back, not loudly: \"I am a murderer.\"\n\nPaul wondered what insight made him call out words not his own:\n\"'What's the profit of any effort if the result is thrown away in a\ntime of weakness?'\"\n\nThe even motion became a clumsiness of wading in mud. Then there was\nsolid ground. Paul said, \"Halt them here if you can, Abara.\" Mister\nJohnson must have shared the sense of safety; they all calmed, heads\ndrooping, shaken breathing slowing to sighs. \"Down, Susie....\" All but\nAbara descended. This was still open grassland, but there was a black\nvelvet curtain of jungle not far off. \"Doc--still got your\nflashlight?\"\n\n\"Eh? No--lost somewhere.\" The old man spoke vacantly; he stumbled to the\nedge of the water, sat with his head on his knees. \"Mijok-Mijok....\"\n\nTejron still had her Vestoian, but now the pygmy woman was panting,\nfully conscious in Tejron's arms and witless with fear. Tejron said,\n\"She's trying to break away. Can't someone talk to her?\"\n\n\"Pakriaa!\" Paul searched for the princess. \"Here--please.\"\n\nNisana whispered, \"I will talk to the Vestoian--yes?\"\n\n\"Not yet. If Pakriaa--\"\n\nPakriaa said thickly, \"I am here. What to say? She is nothing.\"\n\n\"She is nothing to you, Pakriaa? Then Sears chose a poor student.\nBrodaa would have spoken to her. I ask you to tell her the war is over\nand she is among friends.\"\n\n\"Friends? She is Vestoian.\" Pakriaa approached Wright, who did not\nlook up. \"Tocwright--I must speak to the Vestoian kaksma? I owe you my\nlife--will obey you.\"\n\nHe groaned: \"I do not want you to obey me. If there is nothing inside\nto tell you what you should do, then I have nothing to say to you.\"\n\nPakriaa flung up her arm across her eyes as if struck. Tejron\nmuttered, \"I can't restrain her much longer without hurting her.\" It\nwas Nisana who gave the Vestoian the message in the pygmy tongue, a\nripple of sound that must have conveyed some reassurance, for the\nstruggling ceased.\n\n\"Look!\" Paul dug his fingers in Wright's shoulder. \"Over there--\"\n\nThe dark spot under starlight was surely the floating shield; behind\nit, another purposeful splashing, rise and fall of a driving arm.\n\n\"Mijok!\" Wright was on his feet. \"This way! A little upstream--\"\n\nBoth giants were bleeding from small double stab wounds of the kaksma\nteeth. There were four pygmies on Mijok's shield. Elis had carried\nBrodaa and another in his arms and one on his back; they had clung to\nhis fur as he swam the river. Mijok plucked a sodden thing from his\nthigh; its jaws had clenched in flesh when he smashed its body. He\nflipped the ratty thing into the water and remarked like a Charin,\n\"Damned if I could ever care for 'em.\"\n\n\"The others--\"\n\n\"We tried to help them into the trees,\" said Elis. \"Could be some\nsafety in that if the swarm passes by. But most of them ran blindly,\nso--beyond that, Doc, don't ever ask us. We must forget some things.\nWe've all done what we could, so--let's rest a while and go on.\"\n\n\"Oh, we go on,\" Wright said. \"Chaos, or maybe a little bit of light\nfrom time to time. What--sixteen of us now...? Which way was the swarm\ngoing?\"\n\n\"North. Our flight was west. I think this place is safe.\"\n\nAbara called down: \"Mister Johnson says it is safe.\"\n\nPaul said, \"No more travel tonight. Wait here for daylight. This is\nnot the river we wanted, but we know it reaches the sea somehow. Let's\nthink about that in the morning. And--if you will, Doc--I'd like to\nmake that my last order. Let Elis be our commander till we reach the\nisland.\"\n\n\"I!\" Elis was shocked. \"But Paul.... I am a big baby, I wonder and\nwonder and never find the answer to anything.\"\n\nWright laughed; it sounded like laughter. At any rate when his voice\nfound words it was warm, relieved, more like his own than it had been\nat any time since the drums sounded on Lake Argo. \"That doesn't\nmatter, Elis. Paul has done all anyone could, done it well, and\nleadership's a wearing thing. But you can carry it.\"\n\nPaul wished he could see the black face in the dark; he might learn\nfrom it, he thought, so far as a Charin was capable of learning. Elis\nsaid dazedly, \"If you all wish it--\"\n\n\"I wish it,\" said Abro Brodaa.\n\n\"Yes,\" Mijok said. \"Let's not trouble to vote. We know you, Elis.\"\n\n\"I'll do my best....\"\n\nMost of the pygmies collapsed in sleep. The bites the giants had\nreceived were not numerous enough to be a danger, but both were in\nsome pain, and wakeful; Abara also said he would prefer to watch out\nthe night and not sleep. Paul stretched on the damp grass, aware of\nNisana, sitting near him. He tried to make a mental refuge of Dorothy\nand the island; for a time it was possible, but twice, as he thought\nhe was drifting into true healing sleep, the present pulled at him and\nthe thought was not of Dorothy, but of Pakriaa, throwing up her arm\nacross her eyes as if Wright's words had been a deeper wound than any\nshe had received in these days of calamity and defeat.\n\nHe woke while it was still night. The red moon had risen, changing the\nriver to deep purple; the stampede was all ended, and stillness was\neverywhere, underlying the low voices of Wright and Elis. He saw the\nsmall silhouette of Nisana beside him; he could make out none of the\nothers, but he heard the soft breathing of the olifants, and at least\nsome of them must have gone to the jungle and returned, for there was\na steady munching of coarse leaves. He thought: _Sears' pets--one of\nhis ten thousand gifts we can never live long enough to assess. His\nlaughter was another...._\n\nWright was talking placidly: \"We suppose it must have been a similar\nstory on this planet, Elis. The major patterns are the same. The small\nand simple forms must have grown to greater complexity through their\nmillions of years, undoubtedly in the seas, the good saline medium for\nour kind. Then other millions of years, while the first creatures to\ntry the land were clumsy amphibians, still needing the sea but\ndeveloping ways to carry it with them, venture a little further.\nThere's no hurry in history.\"\n\n\"And before the beginning of life?\"\n\n\"Difficult, Elis. We think (there are other theories) that each star\nwith planets was once two--a binary, our astronomers called it--\"\n\nSomeone thin and small came near to Paul, speaking delicately, in an\nextremity of pain, and not to him. \"Nisana,\" Pakriaa said. \"Nisana--\"\n\nNisana was looking up, a little afraid, uncertain. \"Princess?\"\n\n\"Only Pakriaa.... Nisana--I saw how you spoke to the Vestoian, how she\nwas quiet. If you will bring her--and Tejron too? And we go and\nlisten--Tocwright is talking about the stars--the world--I think,\nmaybe, we tell her what he says? Will you come with me, Nisana?\"\n\n\n\n\nPart Three\n\nThe Year Ten\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n_Argo IV_ answered Dunin's brown hand at the tiller, sliding south\nunder a following breeze. Her chief designer Paul Mason liked to call\nher a sloop, admitting that on no planet would any sloop have cared to\nbe found dead with a pair of twelve-foot oars amidships. She was\nthirty-six feet fore and aft. Without a sawmill, shaping boards for\nher strakes had been harder than trimming and placing the single tree\ntrunk that was her keel. Much of her joining was with wooden pegs;\nthere was iron in her too, from the single deposit of ore on the\nisland of Adelphi. Her building had started seventeen months ago in\nthe Year Nine. One month ago Paul's daughter Helen had cracked across\nher bow an earthen flask of wine brought to maturity by Nisana and\n_Argo IV_ had slipped out of the mouth of the Whitebeach River for a\nmaiden voyage--a forty-mile circuit of the island, including the\npassage of a strait where a current from open ocean ran formidably\nbetween Adelphi and a small nameless island in the south. Since then\nshe had journeyed short distances up and down the coast, learning her\nown fussy ways and teaching them to her makers.\n\n_Argo II_ had been a clumsy oared raft of heroic history. Nine Lucifer\nyears ago, roughly the equivalent of twelve Earth years, _Argo II_ had\nnot only brought fifteen survivors of a war to the island, she had\nalso, broadened and repaired, returned to the mainland over the\nten-mile channel to pick up a sixteenth survivor, Abara, and the\ngentle white beasts he had refused to abandon. He had guided them\nsouth, through seventy miles of unknown terrors, and ten miles further\nalong the beach, until it came to an end at sheer cliffs; here _Argo\nII_ found him. One by one--probably no one but Abara could have\ncoaxed them aboard--_Argo II_ had ferried all five of the olifants\nacross. During the rains that came for a dark ending of Year Two, the\nswollen Whitebeach River had torn _Argo II_ from her moorings and she\nhad been swept away down the channel. Now she would be driftwood\nscattered over the infinity of the unexplored; she was remembered.\n\n_Argo III_, still in existence and more often called Betsy, was only a\nboxed platform with outriggers and two pairs of oars. With four giants\nat the oars and a favorable current she could approximate three miles\nan hour and carry several tons. She had been built in the Year Four\nand was still busily bringing slabs of building stone from the base of\nthe coastal range. The stone was red and black or sometimes purple,\nheavy, already smoother than marble without polishing; unlike any\ncommon stone of Earth, it was so hard that wind and sun and water over\nthe centuries had done little with it. Wright believed that was why\nthe coastal range could rise to such heights from a narrow base. While\nthe years in their millions had turned other mountains to level\nground, the glassy rock remained: it could be broken for use but\ndefied erosion like a diamond.\n\n_Argo IV_ was unequivocally a ship; after her trial Paul had carved\nfor her bow a figurehead with the dreaming face of Pakriaa.\n\n\"Maybe,\" Dunin said, \"with a few more like this the first explorations\ncould be around the coast instead of overland? If we had two or three\nmore ships when Kris-Mijok is old enough to go?\"\n\nPaul knew Dorothy had winced, though her face was turned to the\nevening-reddened field of water. \"If he still wants it, when he's old\nenough to go....\"\n\nKris-Mijok Wright, her third-born child and only son, had been born in\nthe Year Three; in Earth years he was only nine. His hunger for the\nlong journeying might be mainly a reflection of his devotion to Dunin,\nherself full of visions and not yet a woman. A tentative half joke, a\nmeans of channeling a child's fantasy into patience, had somehow\nbecome a sober adult plan: that the first major explorations would\nbegin when Kris-Mijok would have a man's strength to take part in\nthem.\n\n\"We might have such ships by then.\" Paul tried to sound judicial. \"Say\nthe Year Eighteen or Nineteen. Yes, a coastal exploration might be\nbetter than trying to cross the continent. Not a circumnavigation\nthough, at first.\"\n\nDunin's big face blossomed in a grin. \"Only about thirty-six thousand\nmiles by the old map made from the air. Open water at north and south\npoles, plenty of it. Could do it in less than a year.\"\n\n\"More like fifty thousand, allowing for deflections, tacking, pull of\ncurrents we don't know. Storms, flat calms, contrary winds, repairs,\nexpeditions ashore for provisions. You pull your horns in just a bit,\nmy girl. Do you remember a desert plateau the map shows in the\nsouthern hemisphere? Solid cliff rising out of the sea for over seven\nhundred miles, and on top of it roasting sand all the way across the\ncontinent--and that plateau is only a small part of the coastal\ndesolation down there. From the equator to the 30th parallel I don't\nthink you'd have a chance to go ashore--and nothing to help you if you\ndid.\"\n\nDunin still grinned. \"Just sail past it.\"\n\n\"Yes--well out to sea, with the equatorial sun at work on you. Very\nfew islands in that region, some of them bare rock.\" And he thought:\n_If I might go myself...! I am fifty now, in Earth years, a young\nfifty...._\n\nHe knew also that Dorothy would not prevent him. She would not go\nherself: she would remain at Adelphi, faithful to the daily things,\nundramatic labors and loyalties that make civilization something more\nthan a vision. She was a young thirty-eight, though she had already\nborne five children. If he went away, she would mind the watch fires\non the beaches, as she had done nine years ago; she would work in the\nschool, the house, the gardens, stand by Christopher Wright during the\ndepressions that sometimes overcame him. She would grow old waiting.\nTherefore, Paul knew, he would never leave her. \"The explorations will\ncome in good time, Dunin,\" he said. \"You'll have 150 years to watch\nand take part. I think you'll live to see the other continent too, and\nthe great islands in the southwest. In the meantime--there's so much\nexploring to be done right here!\" He watched the water too, aware of\nDorothy's face turned to him, sober and appraising. \"You know,\nDunin--that island we visited today--that could hold a community of a\nthousand between its two little hills. And I'm remembering the one\nforty miles north of us. _Argo II_ was swept ashore there: get Doc to\ntell you that story sometime. I was sick for a week and laid up in one\nof the limestone caves while the others repaired the raft. A round\nisland less than five miles across. We might sail there next trip.\"\n\n\"The other continent,\" Dunin murmured, and she watched the rising\nblue-green mound of Adelphi in the south. \"The islands of the\nsouthwest....\"\n\nDorothy leaned against the hand-hewn rail, looking northeast, saying\nlightly, \"There he is....\" The stone figure in the coastal range grew\nvisible as the channel current pressed them a little too far eastward.\nThe vast features were not clear; one could find the line of shoulder.\n\"And Sears said, 'He looks west of the sun.' Was it long ago you told\nme that, Paul?\"\n\n\"In a way it was.... Penny for 'em, Dorothy?\"\n\n\"Oh----\" Her brown face crinkled in the way he hoped for. \"I was\nclimbing down off philosophy with my usual bump--wondering what hell\nthe twins have been raising while we're away. Brodaa's patience with\nthem passes belief. With her own three sets of twins she's had\npractice. I wish Pak could have had children. Twenty-nine--late middle\nage for her people.... Helen's going to make a better med student than\never I was--don't you think, Paul? Seems like more than just a kid's\nenthusiasm.\"\n\n\"I think so.\" And Sears' plump daughter Teddy (Theodora-Pakriaa) would\nno doubt find herself too, sometime: there was no hurry. Even\nChristopher Wright no longer seemed to feel that time was hounding\nhim, though his years by the Earth calendar were sixty-five, his hair\nand beard were white, his wiry thinness moved deliberately to save the\nstrength he had once been able to spend like unconsidered gold....\n\"Look!\"\n\nDorothy said carefully, \"But that is impossible.\" A column of smoke on\nthe flank of the coastal range, above one of the beaches where\nbuilding stone was found. Blue-gray against the red and black, it rose\nstraight in untroubled air. \"They weren't taking Betsy out till we got\nback.\"\n\n\"Too high anyway,\" Dunin said. \"No need to climb so high for the\nstone.\"\n\nDorothy whispered, \"I have _never_ quite believed that Ed and Ann----\"\n\n\"Oh, Dorothy! Well, we----\"\n\n\"Yes, I saw the lifeboat go down on the channel. It didn't sink.\" She\nshut her eyes. \"It was a misty evening, lover, more ways than one.\nRemember, Dunin?\"\n\n\"I'll always remember.\"\n\n\"Paul, I know that when the open-sea current below the island took the\nlifeboat it must have been smashed against the cliffs--oh, of\ncourse--and for nine years the sea spiders will have used the pieces\nof it for their little castles and hideaways. All the same--Ed and Ann\ncould have managed to swim ashore. Cross the range somehow or go\naround it.\"\n\n\"Nothing to eat. Barren rock straight up from the beaches, where there\nare any beaches, for ninety miles south of the only place where they\ncould have landed and for twenty miles north of it.\"\n\n\"But no kaksmas in the coast range either; no omasha, this side. There\n_are_ beaches here and there. They might have found--shellfish--blue\nseaweed.\"\n\n\"Nine years----\"\n\n\"It _is_ smoke. Our people wouldn't be up there....\"\n\n\"You've never wanted to talk much about that day.\"\n\n\"No, I--haven't. I didn't behave too well myself. Yes, there are\nthings I've never told.... Paul, Ed Spearman was like somebody I\ndidn't know. He did say in so many words that he planned to go to\nVestoia, not to--to throw himself on the mercy of Lantis, but to 'give\nher civilization'--he said. We tried, Ann and I, tried to reason with\nhim against that. I think he had some alternative plan--maybe flying\nsouth of Vestoia as far as the fuel would take him and starting a\ncommunity of his own--with Ann and me, you know, and himself the old\nman of the tribe.\"\n\n\"And without us,\" said Dunin mildly.\n\n\"Yes, dear, I recall that. He put that in words....\" In a way, Paul\ndid not want her to go on, living it over again, but she had a need to\nspeak of it. \"I suppose his plans made a kind of sense if you accepted\nthe premise. As I couldn't, of course. When he said you were all\nlost, I believed (I had to believe) that he was--not lying perhaps,\nbut telling something he hadn't truly seen. I know that was where I\nlet go--I raged and screamed, and when he grabbed my arm (probably\njust wanting to quiet me down)--well, if he's living he'll have two or\nthree white scars down his cheek. Uh-huh: the Dope comes clean. I ever\nthink I was trying to get hold of my pistol when Arek took it away,\nand took his away too. After that she forced him to give a precise\naccount of everything that had happened, every detail. She made him\ntell it five or six times, watching for contradictions. She\nwas--justice embodied. I was afraid of her myself even while I loved\nher for it. I knew what he told us then was the truth: the fuel was\nlow, he'd come direct to the island with no real knowledge of what had\nhappened to you. He was saner after the telling. He lost a--a certain\nlook of exalted listening, as if somebody behind Arek's shoulder were\ntelling him what to do. Arek never gave back his pistol. We were on\nthe beach. The giants had been bringing wood all day for a beacon\nfire. I remember the exact shape of a big shell at my feet, the look\nof a bit of driftwood tossed in by the channel breakers....\"\n\n\"And Ann--\"\n\n\"Oh, Ann! Tom two or three ways as usual. She was very much in love\nwith him, you know, from our first days on Lucifer. But her mind was a\nbattleground with no armistice. I think Ed always knew that. When he\npleaded with her--reasonably too--she couldn't think, she could only\ncry and say: 'I won't go with you--I won't go.' He stopped\ntrying--suddenly, as if he'd knowingly turned off a light inside\nhimself--unsteady light and the only one he had, I reckon. He said,\n'So much for the human race: but I'll see what one man can do here\nbefore I'm dead without issue.' And he walked off to the lifeboat,\nwhile Arek let his pistol dangle from her finger--and, Paul, I shall\nalways think he knew Ann would run after him. I saw her tugging,\ntrying to pull him out of the boat--but she was pulled in and it was\ngone.\"\n\n\"And I remember,\" said Dunin, \"what you did after we lost sight of\nit.\"\n\n\"What I did...? What was that, Dunin? I'm blank there.\"\n\n\"You went to the beacon fire and put on more wood.\"\n\n\"Well,\" she said vaguely, \"of course. We all did.... That _is_ smoke,\nPaul. Lantis' pygmies or the wild giants couldn't be there on the\ncliffs.\"\n\nDunin said, \"Oh, there are no giants in that country, Dorothy. Those\nlow hills I remember west of the first camp--those kaksma hills were\nan impassable boundary in the old days. The country west of\nthem--nobody went there, ever. And south of them--Vestoia. My wild\nkindred are all very far north of here....\"\n\n_Argo IV_ eased up to the wharf, where Elis and Arek handled her like\na toy, making her fast with ropes of a fabric as good as linen. Wright\nwas there with them, and Tejron, and Pakriaa and Nisana, who were\ninseparable. \"Too far,\" said Wright, and handed Paul the field\nglasses. \"Just smoke.\"\n\nElis grumbled, \"What's up there to burn? No vegetation. Rock.\"\n\nThe smoke seemed to be thinning. \"How long since our last trip over?\"\n\n\"Eight days, Paul,\" Tejron recalled. \"My impatient eldest wanted to\nsee if he could handle Betsy's oars, remember?\"\n\n\"He could, too.\" Paul remembered. \"Sears-Danik pulled his weight, my\nlady. Yes, that was the last time. And we saw nothing unusual.\"\n\nOnly Nisana thought to ask, \"Good voyage today, Paul?\"\n\n\"Fine, darling. You should have come.\"\n\nWright was carefully calm. \"I'll go over, with Paul, Elis--and--\"\n\n\"And me,\" said Dorothy, not smiling.\n\n\"Well.... Okay, Dope.\"\n\nPakriaa's thin wrinkled face turned to him. \"Nisana and I?\nMiniaan--she would remember the Vestoian dialect--but she is at the\ncity. It would need an hour to send for her, and then it would be\ngetting dark.\"\n\n\"Yes, come with us....\"\n\nThe site of Jensen City was not where Wright and Paul had originally\ndreamed of it but two miles south, where the radiance of Sears Lake\nhung in the hills. A gap in the west admitted ocean winds; the outlet\nof the lake ran for a mile to the edge of a red stone cliff and\ntumbled over in a waterfall five hundred feet high. There would one\nday be houses along that mile of river. Already, near the waterfall,\nthere was a temple of red and black stone devoted to quiet without\nritual, thought of sometimes as a memorial to Sears and to the other\ndead, more often simply as a place to go for the satisfactions of\nsilence. It had no name; Paul hoped it would never have one.\n\nMiniaan of Vestoia was an eager citizen. The old wound had left one\nside of her head cruelly scarred; from the other side she was\nbeautiful, by Charin as well as pygmy standards. Younger than Pakriaa,\nshe was the mother of four, by Kajana--the archer whom Mijok had once\ncarried on his shield, who would never walk again nor live a day\nwithout pain, and who was more cheerful as a permanent habit of mind\nthan any of the other pygmy survivors of that war. The fifty-four\npygmy children of Jensen City were all fathered by Abara and Kajana--a\nfact which caused old Abara to draw dead-pan comparisons between\nhimself and Mister Johnson and to grow darkly desperate when Kajana\nwistfully asked him to explain why it was a joke....\n\nElis shipped the oars; Paul let down the anchor, a heavy block of\nstone, in two fathoms of blackening water; Elis lifted the dugout over\nthe side and held it for them. He himself swam the short distance to\nthe beach and eased the canoe through the shallows. Even now at low\ntide there was barely a quarter mile of gray sand between water and\ncliffs. Chipping away of building stone had created a fair path a\nhundred feet up; beyond, natural irregularities made it possible to\nclimb another two hundred to the first setback of the great sea\nwall--a ledge which ran only as far as the next patch of beach, five\nmiles south. Sunset had been ending when _Argo IV_ came home; here\nthere was a depth of evening quiet, no sign of smoke or life, no sound\nbut the long hiss and moaning of small waves. \"We might make a fire\nhere,\" Wright said. \"But there's enough light. They--they?--must have\nseen _Argo_.\"\n\n\"There,\" Dorothy said, and ran up the sand.\n\nThe others watched in frozen helplessness as the woman came down the\ncrude cliff path, gaunt, seeming tall only because of the\ngauntness--flaring ribs, thighs fallen in, every arm bone visible. Her\nhair was black disorder to her waist, her body a battleground of\nbruises, dirt, scars old and new, and she winced away from Dorothy\nwith protesting hands. \"You mustn't touch me because I'm very dirty,\nbut I know who you are. Besides, I had to burn the last of my clothes.\nMy baby died. I know who you are. You see, my milk stopped. You're\nDorothy Leeds. I left him on the cliff. Matron would not approve. You\nsee----\"\n\n\"Ann--Ann----\"\n\n\"I have two other sons, but this one died. On the cliff. I used to\nknow a man who called me Miss Sarasate, but that was just his way of\ntalking--I don't happen to be in practice.\" Still trying to fend off\nDorothy's arms, Ann fell on her face....\n\nPakriaa was speaking softly, in the room where Ann was\nsleeping--Wright's room. \"She will be healed,\" Pakriaa said. \"I can\nremember--and you remember it too, Paul--how my own mind refused to be\nmy servant for a while.\" Since Ann had been brought to Jensen City,\nPakriaa and Nisana had never left her: the little women, both now far\nfrom youth, took on the duties of nursing with a fierce\nprotectiveness, so that there was little for even Dorothy to do. Ann\nhad slept heavily all night and morning. At noon the stone-walled\nhouse remained cool; mild air entered at the screenless window\nopenings, stirring the wall map of Adelphi and the three of Paul's\npaintings which were the only decorations Wright allowed in this\nascetic shelter. There was glass-making now, but in such a climate,\nwith no serious insect pests, it seemed a waste of effort to make\nwindows; a long overhang of the eaves was sufficient against the\nrains. The house was large, U-shaped around a garden courtyard open\ntoward Sears Lake; the walls were of black stone, the roof of a\nmaterial indistinguishable from slate, carried by hardwood timbers.\nWright shared this house with Mijok and Arek, Pakriaa, Nisana,\nMiniaan, and their children and Arek's. There were five other such\ncommunal houses overlooking the lake; a seventh was building. The\nchildren were everywhere: it was, and would be for many years, a city\nof the young. Rak had died in the Year Four, a matter of falling\nasleep without waking, but Kamon lived, sharing a house with Tejron,\nPaul and Dorothy, Brodaa and Kajana. Lately Sears' daughter had taken\nover the task of caring for Kajana in his helplessness, lifting him to\nand from a wheel chair that Paul and Mijok had contrived or carrying\nhim to a hammock slung near the waterfall, where he could watch the\nocean and its changes. In middle age, Kajana had taught himself to\nwrite, and kept a journal of the colony with a sober passion for\ndetail.\n\nAnn had not waked when Dorothy and Nisana washed her and clipped the\ndreadful tangle of her hair. \"She will be healed,\" Pakriaa insisted.\n\"Maybe in the next waking.\" And when Ann's gray eyes came open an hour\nlater, they did show a measuring sanity, recognizing Dorothy and Paul,\nbut wincing away when Nisana smiled and touched her.\n\n\"Do not be afraid of us,\" Pakriaa whispered. \"We are still proud. But\nour pride now is that no one is afraid of us.... You came to my house\nin the old old days, remember? My blue house, and I thinking I would\nbe Queen of the World? I laugh at that now. Do not look at what I was,\nAnn.\"\n\n\"Pakriaa.... Paul, you haven't changed much.\"\n\n\"One of our other friends is about to bring a man-sized meal----\"\n\n\"Why, Paul, you must be----\"\n\n\"Fifty, Earth calendar----\"\n\nDorothy said, \"We measure it in Lucifer years, pretty please.\"\n\n\"Nicer,\" Paul admitted. \"That way I'm around thirty-seven. Ann,\nyou--let's see: one Earth year, one point three eight--damn mental\narithmetic--let's call you half past twenty-seven.\"\n\n\"Imagine that.\" Ann achieved a smile. \"And--Pakriaa?\"\n\n\"Twenty-nine. See--already I am an old woman and ugly.\"\n\n\"Don't be absurd, Pak,\" Dorothy said. \"And this lady----\"\n\n\"You would not remember me,\" said Nisana.\n\n\"Oh, but I do, I do. You--voted for Paul----\"\n\nPakriaa chuckled with unforced gaiety. \"Politics,\" Nisana chirped.\n\"P.S., I got the job.\" Paul pinched her tiny ear lobe and stepped out\nto the kitchen, where he found Wright with Arek. The children were at\nschool, with Brodaa, Mijok, and Miniaan: ordinarily Wright would have\nbeen there too. When the youngest of this house were through with\nlessons they would go wandering in the hills with Mijok and Muson, so\nthat Ann might have quiet, with only distant sounds of the laughter\nand playing in sunlight. \"She's awake,\" Paul said, and Wright hurried\nto the bedroom, but Arek lingered, filling a tray.\n\nArek had grown almost to Mijok's height, filling out, a red mother\ngoddess still bemused by inner discoveries. Her fine soft-furred\nfingers fussed at the earthen dishes on the wooden tray. \"No ambition,\nno achievement--nothing, I think, could be worth the price of what's\nhappened to her. Whether she recovers completely or not. There's human\nright and wrong. I think sometimes, Paul, it's not necessary to do\nmuch wondering. You can look straight at a thing and say: 'This ought\nnot to be.'\"\n\n\"Granted,\" Paul said, watching the garden through the broad kitchen\nwindow. His eldest, Helen, must have elected to do a little work after\nschool instead of strolling away with the others. She was weeding, her\nbrown head sheltered from the sun by an improvised hat of leaves; but\nfor that she was prettily naked as the day she was born, and though\nshe was humming to herself, she restrained the sound so that Paul\ncould hardly hear it. She saw him in the window and grinned and waved.\nShe had most of Dorothy's warm coloring, with Paul's long-legged\nslimness.\n\nArek saw her too and smiled. \"What Ann should have had too.... Paul, I\ntold you once, we love you. All the good new things we have--your\nwork. All the same there's a devil in--some of you. As in us too, of\ncourse. Need of the laws is obvious. If Spearman is responsible--the\nVestoians too, maybe?--then I think we live in too much seclusion\nhere.\" She took up the tray. \"Too easy to live all the time in\nParadise and--leave things undone.\"\n\n\"Yes. Vestoia is big, Arek--or was, when it almost destroyed us.\"\n\n\"True. But you tell me that over there on the beach she said, 'I have\ntwo other sons.' Living, did she mean? We must find them, and Spearman\ntoo.\"\n\n\"I believe she can tell us about it soon.\"\n\n\"Understood that I go with you when you find them.\"\n\n\"Yes. Yes, Arek....\"\n\nIn the bedroom Arek's manner was altogether changed. \"Observe: this is\nasonis _r\u00f4ti \u00e0 la mode Versailles_, whatever that means. All I did was\nroast it. These are (Paul says) lima beans Munchausen, and here we\nhave could-be asparagus. And by the way, the cheese tastes better'n it\nsmells.\"\n\n\"Cheese----\"\n\n\"Asonis milk,\" said Wright. \"They moo, too.\"\n\n\"Oh, you've tamed them.\" Pain fought with interest in the haggard\nface. \"Yes, Ed wanted to do that, but we--somehow we never----\"\n\n\"If you're good,\" Arek said, \"and eat all that, there's cake.\"\n\n\"You found something for sugar?\"\n\n\"Can't tell it from terrestrial,\" Dorothy chattered, \"only it's pink.\nFrom a tree fruit sort of like a plum. We have a plantation of 'em\nacross the lake. You boil it down to nothing and the sugar\ncrystallizes out. We make another kind from sap, not as good as maple.\nFlour--that's from the same old wheat that came from Earth.\nMiniaan--oh, you don't know her yet--Miniaan and Paul have\nexperimented around with the local grass grains--nothing yet that\nmeasures up to wheat.\" Ann picked at the food, crying weakly at the\nfirst mouthful. \"Ah, don't do that,\" said Dorothy, looking away. \"You\ncame home, that's all.\"\n\nLater she ate ravenously. \"I want to tell you----\"\n\nIt took a long time in telling. Once she fell asleep but woke an hour\nlater, obsessed with a need to continue....\n\nThe lifeboat drifted south, its last remnant of fuel gone in a mad\neffort to leap the coastal range. Water sneaked in at the seal of the\nfloor window, damaged in an earlier landing, and Ed Spearman talked to\nhimself. \"Fugitives from a Sunday school--we'll live.\" Like a hurt boy\nhe said, \"We'll show 'em....\" When the current beyond the island swept\nthem toward the cliffs, he opened the door and pulled Ann into the\nwater, dragging her, forgetting that she was herself a strong swimmer.\nLater, on the beach, he was tender, trying to comfort and reassure her\nwith a vision of the future abundantly real to him. They had no food,\nno way to light a fire of driftwood. They would go to Vestoia, he\nsaid, convince Lantis that they were friends, with something to offer\nher empire; they would \"bring her civilization.\"\n\nFrom this beach there seemed to be no passage north. They could have\nfound one by climbing high into the range--Ann did so, nine years\nlater. But Spearman found a ledge of sorts running south: it might\ntake them the eighty-odd miles to the lower end of the range or give\nout at any point, trapping them. It did give out twice; both times,\nrather than clamber higher on the cliffs, Spearman hurled his famished\nbody through the breakers and swam south, aided by the current until\nit was possible to continue along the rocks. Ann followed, not quite\nwishing for the death the ocean could have given easily. They kept\nalive with shellfish and seaweed washed ashore and small crustaceans\nthat hid in the tide lines and in crannies of wet rock; there were\npools of rain water and violent small streams plunging down the range.\nIt took them fifty days to cover the eighty miles. (\"I think I spent a\nhundred coming back,\" Ann said. \"Couldn't swim, with the baby. It\nwould have been against the current anyway. Climbed--sometimes went\nback miles from a dead end to try again.\") In the afternoons the sun\npressed on them with total fury; then they could only crawl into what\nshadow the rocks gave and wait for the torture to cease.\n\nBut at last there were trees. Level ground. In a few miles, a rapid\nfriendly river. (\"Are there rivers here? I've forgotten. Nothing\nprettier in the world. I let that one close over me. Ed pulled me\nout--we had to go on.\")\n\nThere were five more of those bright leaping coastal streams in a\njourney of another fifty miles southeast through good country, where\nthe great range thinned out into rolling jungle and meadowland. There\nwere asonis and small game. Spearman made himself weapons. Ann could\nremember these days almost with pleasure. They had, she said,\nsomething the flavor of a delayed childhood, a glimpse of Eden.\nSpearman was for a time simply a strong and intelligent man measuring\nhimself against nature for survival, master of a simple environment\nwith none to question his decisions and no social complexities to warp\nthem. (\"I wished we could settle in that country, the two of us. I\neven begged for it. He had to go on.\")\n\nFrom the remembered map, Spearman knew there was an obscure pygmy\nsettlement south of the end of the range, some fifty miles below\nVestoia: merely a cluster of parallel lines that had appeared in the\nphotographs, it might or might not be a part of the empire of Lantis.\nIt was near the headwaters of a seventh river, which flowed, not to\nthe coast, but eastward, into the deep, wide, violent outlet of Lake\nArgo. (\"He never told me why he was following that river so\ncautiously, until we reached the villages. And history repeated\nitself.\")\n\nThe villages were a furtive, chronically frightened community. They\nknew of Vestoia but believed, correctly, that the groping tentacles of\nempire had not yet found them. Lantis' drive was mainly to the east,\nwhere the country was easier and pygmy settlements were numerous; even\nher war against Pakriaa's people had been a diversion, more a matter\nof hurt pride than gainful conquest. Between these hidden villages and\nVestoia there were meadows, dangerous with omasha, and some swampland;\nbelow the two small Vestoian lakes the current of the river Argo was\ntoo fierce for the flimsy boats of Lantis. So the villages of the\nseventh river, under a sly but feeble queen, waited like a rabbit in a\nhedge. With sharply calculated drama--but smiling this time, Ann said,\nlike a pleased teacher at a blackboard--Ed Spearman overturned another\nidol and became a god.\n\nAt the end of two years, when Spearman's goddess had borne him twin sons,\nthere was industry in the villages. There was an army of a thousand spears,\nbladed with iron from certain small hills in the north between Vestoia and\nSpearman City. These hills were dangerous with burrows, but workers of a\nparticular kind could be made to go there. The soldiers overcame their\ndistaste for the bow when they had watched the course of arrows properly\nvaned and tipped with iron or bronze. They did not need to be taught how to\nhate Vestoia--nevertheless they relished it when Spearman decided that\npolitical realities demanded he should tell them an epic tale, the tale of\na war he and companion gods had waged against that place. Vengeance, divine\nor human, was a thing the pygmies had understood from the first biting and\nscratching of infancy.\n\nAnn had been bewildered by that first gust of oratory against Vestoia.\nSpearman had neglected to prepare her for it during the long two years\nspent in teaching the pygmies a limited English and the beginnings of\nindustry: it might not have been clear to himself that such a move\nwould be necessary in order to hold his people's enthusiasm and\ndevotion. Ann wondered. \"You had thought once of going to Vestoia----\"\nSpearman turned on her with an anger partly cynical humor: \"They hurt\nus, didn't they? Oh, I might have toyed with the idea as a choice of\nevils before we found our real friends. They killed Doc, didn't they?\nAnd Paul and Sears and those milky giant friends of ours.\"\n\n\"But you didn't see----\"\n\n\"_What?_\"\n\nSpearman believed now that he had seen the full end of that war. Ann\ngot it through her head after a while. When he said that Vestoia must\nbe punished for past wrongs, there was a smiling half admission of\ndisingenuous policy. \"It'll work,\" he said. \"We can get away with it.\"\nBut the death of all the others except Dorothy had become for him\nsomething like an article of faith, not to be examined. At this\nmoment, Ann said, she had begun to think of a northward journey, but\nthe odds were darkly against it. The twins were still nursing and\nsickly; the demands of mere daily living are heavy on a goddess who\nmust also supervise housekeeping. There was, for instance, the endless\nsquabbling treachery of the household slaves. At that time also, Ann\nhoped to soften or divert some changes that seemed to be taking place\nin Spearman himself. (\"I wonder if they were really changes....\")\n\nSpearman detested slavery, he said. But in a primitive economy how\nelse could you get the work done? Even in daylight, when the kaksmas\nwere half helpless, only the bravest soldiers would go into those\nhills--not to work, but only as guards for the chained lines of\nlaborers, guards who could run fast if the kaksmas came out for a\nday-blind attack and leave the slaves to be consumed. Bad: Spearman\nwas sorry such things had to be. Still, the slaves were poor or\nsometimes dangerous material at best; besides that, they hated\nresponsibility and were therefore really happier in slavery and\nreceived better care than they could otherwise have had. So you had to\nsee it as almost a eugenic, even a humanitarian measure as well as an\nunavoidable transitional phase, and in any case you can't make an\nomelette without breaking eggs. At the use of meat slaves for the\npalace household, Spearman had to draw the line, and he instituted\nlaws against the custom for the rest of his little kingdom, but they\nwere difficult to enforce without compromising matters of greater\npolitical importance. \"Transitional\" became a somewhat sacred word for\nSpearman over the years, a sustaining conception when things went\nbadly and when his ingrained sensitivities brought from Earth were\nviolated by the brisk egg-breaking of a Neolithic culture.\n\nEven the first war against Vestoia, in the third year of Spearman's\ndeification, was part of a transitional phase, although Spearman did\nnot feel that his pygmies were advanced enough to be troubled with\nfine distinctions. It is better for a god to resist pressures for\nexplanation.\n\nThat first war was well planned, with limited objective. Six hundred\nspearwomen and archers crossed the Argo below Vestoia and fell on the\ncity from the east, so that there was no clue to their southern\norigin; they set afire a mile of the lake settlement, took three\nhundred captives, and vanished--again eastward, leaving a few crippled\ndefenders to convey the message that they would come again. It had the\ndesired effect: the armies of Lantis foamed eastward like crazed\nhornets, while Spearman's force slipped home across the Argo without a\ntrace. In the following year they struck again, again from the east,\nbut with a larger force, laying waste nearly a third of that part of\nthe city on the eastern shores of the Vestoian lakes. The palace of\nLantis, nerve center of empire, was on the west shore. Probably the\nqueen knew nothing of what had happened until she saw the far shore\nburied in smoke, and by the time she crossed over, she would have\nlearned only that Spearman's army had promised to come a third time\nand take Lantis herself and assume command of the empire.\n\nThey did, just six years after that lonely journey along the rocks.\nAnn's twin sons were five years old, five Lucifer years. In the first\ntwo campaigns, Spearman had not shown himself in person to the\nVestoians. In this third battle he was at the head of his army,\nmassive and tall; with a cold, unhappy precision, he was using a long\nhardwood stick with a razor-edge semicircular blade. And this time his\nlegion had driven in out of the west, directly against the palace and\nthe temples and sacred places of the Queen of the World.\n\nLantis was aging then, and sick, and bewildered; she probably never\nunderstood that it was merely a question of her own methods being used\nagainst her. Even when her city was in flames around her and her\npeople were scattering into forest and swamp and lake, she could\nneither yield nor destroy herself; thus it was her misfortune to be\ntaken alive.\n\nA week later Ann and the children were brought by litter from Spearman\nCity; Spearman recognized the political advantage, almost necessity,\nof their presence at the triumph. Lantis was ceremonially dragged\nthrough the still-smoldering and stinking streets and forced to drink\nan infusion of the green-flower weed that destroyed the self: this was\npygmy custom, which Spearman watched in regretful disgust, anxious\nthat his small sons should preserve the impassive dignity proper to\ngods. \"They're far from human, you know--they don't feel things as we\ndo....\" The boys were puzzled and curious.\n\nSo far as Ann knew, however, Lantis was not eaten at the festival. \"He\ntold me she was mercifully put away after the excitement died down,\nand another meat slave was sacrificed, made up to look like\nLantis--not deception, but ritual substitution; Ed felt he'd achieved\nquite a step in progress there. It showed, he said, they were\nbeginning to accept ritual for reality under the influence of----Oh,\nthe devil with it.... He moved his capital to Vestoia. The palace was\nrestored--modernized. I lived there--two and a half years. That's\nwhere I bore him another son. I'll never know how I came to allow\nit--a kind of madness, hate close to love--something.... He didn't\nwant me any more, you know. He had some ideas about--ascetic\ndiscipline--purity--I don't know what exactly--and he didn't try to\nexplain it to me. I'd hated him with all my mind for years--before the\nVestoian wars--but I'm not a good hater. I even still imagined I\ncould influence him a little--until the baby was born and he was in\nblack despair because it wasn't a daughter. I had to escape. I could\nfeel my mind, my self, rotting away--dissolving, as the Vestoian\nempire was dissolving, for that matter. He couldn't hold them. It\nbegan to fall apart right away. They were terrified of him and of his\nSpearman City bodyguards--weasels.... They simply drifted away into\nthe woods and didn't come back. I doubt if they've organized anywhere\nelse. Lantis must have had a rare sort of skill--the city was all\nhers: she built it out of Stone Age villagers, and it died with her.\nEd tried everything to keep them--bribes, threats, endless spying and\npublic executions by his guard. Bread and circuses, meaningless\noffices for favorites with fancy clothes and no duties. It didn't\nwork. At the time I escaped, the population was down to--he'd never\ntell me, but my guess is under ten thousand for the whole city. There\nwas an epidemic--rather like flu. I used that as a reason to take the\nbaby back to Spearman City, knowing Ed would need to stay and go on\ntrying to hold things together. I thought he would let me take the\ntwins--John--David----\"\n\n\"Rest awhile,\" said Arek. \"We're going to bring them home too.\" Ann\ncould not speak. \"How would you like to bathe again in our lake? I'll\nhold you up. Water's warm with the sun--best part of the day----\"\n\n\"I'd like it. It's so pretty. What do you call it?\"\n\n\"Sears Lake.\"\n\n\"Sears.... What am I made of? I haven't thought or asked----\"\n\n\"It was a Vestoian arrow,\" Wright said. \"At the end he enjoyed\nremembering Earth.\"\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\"The city is a desolation.\" Miniaan slipped out of shadow into the\nclearing, where the others waited for her without a fire; she was shaken,\nshort of breath. No longer young, she had hurried on the ten-mile return\njourney from Vestoia through high-noon heat of jungle. \"I could not even\nfind the house where I was born. Oh, Pakriaa--Paul--of every ten houses,\nseven are empty. The streets are dirt and rubbish. No one knew me. Well,\nthat's not strange. Those I met supposed I was a stranger, probably from\nthe east. But the ones who were suspicious did not challenge me--they\nslipped into their sorry houses and stared at me through the cracks.\" She\nsat down in weariness, wiping sweat from her scarred head and shoulder.\n\"Word of what I said will travel quickly. But not one followed me here. I\nmade sure of that.\"\n\nArek asked, \"Have you had anything to eat?\"\n\n\"No, I--only walked through the streets.... Doc, some had English\nwords--a few, badly spoken. No one could pronounce _d_ at the\nbeginning of a word, and they had absurd turns of speech I don't\nunderstand. One woman said to me, 'One fella goddamn skirt belong you\nwhat name?' I thought she was asking about this skirt I made in the\nold fashion, but then we spoke in the old tongue: I found she only\nwanted to know who I was and where I came from. It seems that now,\nunder Spearman-abron-Ismar, they indicate--what word do I\nwant?--social--social levels----\"\n\n\"Castes?\"\n\n\"Castes, that is it, Paul--they indicate castes by the color of a skirt. In\nthe old days there were only two castes--soldiers and voluntary laborers,\nnot considering the family of Lantis or the slaves at the bottom. Now\nthere are--oh, ten, twenty, I don't know. Those who work at the dye pots\nmust never do anything else, and they can look down on the workers in\nhides; this woman was a maker of arrowheads and despised both.... I told\nher (and some others) that I was a stranger from a distant village, and I\nsaid I had heard by rumor of other gods and giants, who would come one day\nsoon to talk with Spearman-abron-Ismar--yes, they call him that,\nSpearman-male-issue-of-Ismar. It frightened her: she made excuses and ran\naway. I told it to another, an old woman, who broke out cursing and\nweeping. She said, Oh, no more of them! No more----' And sat down in the\nstreet and scattered dust on her head.\"\n\n\"Did you see--him?\"\n\n\"No, Paul. I saw the palace--changed, with new tall doors. There were\nsoldiers at the entrance, so I did not dare go near. They wore a\nheaddress--it was the old bark fabric, I think, but a shape I never\nsaw. I saw the great stockade--always the biggest thing on the shore\nof North Lake--still in repair; there was the same sluice, to wash\naway the blood of the meat slaves. There is still a ferry near it,\nwhere the crossing is narrow at the lake's inlet; I could see\nacross--streets and tree-sheltered houses. And outside the city I saw\na mound, very foul. Once the city was clean. There was a boy playing\nnear it--ran when he saw me, but I caught him and asked him about that\nmound. I could hardly understand his gabble. It seems that nowadays in\nVestoia children have reason to be afraid of grown women. When we\ncould talk he told me the mound was the grave of the False Empress,\nthe Wicked One--everyone who passes is required to defile it. A law.\"\n\nPakriaa laced her wrinkled hands at her throat, smiling at Christopher\nWright, quoting a few of his own words: \"'The laws are living things:\nlet men guard them against crippling and disease.'\"\n\nNisana asked, \"What is next to do?\"\n\n\"We sleep on it,\" Wright said. \"Long journey. We're tired. We'll go\nthere in the morning. With our weapons of course, but....\"\n\nMijok said softly, \"First-light is a good time.\"\n\n\"I think there won't be any fighting,\" Miniaan said, and she relaxed\nand leaned happily against Muson's plump knee and ate the meal Arek\nhad ready for her in fastidious birdlike bites. \"If they're troubled\nby the rumors I scattered they'll slip away and hide, not fight.\nThey're weary, bewildered, disillusioned people--at least that is the\ntemper of the city as I felt it.\"\n\nNisana murmured, \"With Spearman's bodyguard it could be different.\"\n\n\"Why,\" said Wright, \"he'd never turn them against us. Not if he's the\nman I used to know, or anything like that man. He came a long way with\nus once.\" But Paul had to wonder: _Was he ever with us?_\n\nThere were six giants in the party: Mijok, Arek, Muson, Elis,\nSears-Danik, Dunin. Elis was the year's Governor at Adelphi, but\nDorothy had held that position the year before and would assume its\nsimple duties in his absence. Nisana's eldest twin daughters had\nwanted to come, but Nisana had not allowed it, requiring them to stay\nin school under Brodaa's temperate discipline; the only pygmies here\nwere herself, Pakriaa, and Miniaan. The group had come 120 miles\noverland, after _Argo IV_ set them on a beach north of the coastal\nrange: this had seemed better than taking the sloop south, where\nharbor would be uncertain and the winds and currents unknown. The\nfirst twenty miles ashore had been a retracing of Abara's long-ago\njourney with the olifants, through swampy and treacherous jungle.\nAfter rounding the range they could follow the eastern edge of the\ngrassland that spread on its lee side, traveling in the open only at\nnight, to avoid omasha. For all of one day they were bedeviled by a\nswarm of biting flies, and since there were brown wings circling they\ncould not escape into full sunlight, where the flies would not follow.\nEventually Pakriaa found an evil-smelling plant and remembered its use\nfrom old times. The juice of the root was a protection; the smell was\nalmost as distressing as the bites but less dangerous. Miniaan of\nVestoia had never heard of the plant's use: perhaps that explained why\nVestoia had never exploited the otherwise pleasant region due west of\nLake Argo.\n\nThere was fitful sleep in the daylight following Miniaan's return, and\nthen an evening meal. Arek and Muson and the two young giants seemed\nuntroubled by tomorrow, full of speculative curiosity. Mijok was\nuneasy, though he would not put it in words; Elis, too, would be\nremembering. Wright said again, \"He came a long way with us.... Jensen\nchose him--remember that: chose him from among seven hundred other\nphysically fine youths who had the same training, the same kind of\ncourage, who wanted the--privilege, as he did.\"\n\n\"I can always wonder what Jensen himself would have made of Lucifer.\"\n\nWright said, almost with reproach, \"Jensen was a great engineer, Paul,\nbut he was also a student of history. Compared with what his\nleadership would have been, mine has been weak, vacillating,\nacademic--it was bound to be. I take credit for some achievements.\nI've said give protoplasm a chance. We have done that. We've\nestablished the climate of liberty under law (for our very small\ngroup) and proved that a human mind can by-pass twenty thousand years\nof blundering, with no other help than a flexible language and the few\nbasic rules of civilized action--as the so-called savages of Earth\nalways proved it whenever they had a chance to secure a genuine\neducation and fair treatment. But--in our material development there\nmust have been a thousand lost opportunities--things Jensen (and\nprobably Ed Spearman) would have seen at once.\"\n\nPaul laughed. \"Ed could have designed a better sloop.\"\n\nWright dismissed that with a chuckle. \"Ach--she floats, boy. She\nsails.... When I get angry or impatient or discouraged--when I stick\ntoo tight to a plan of my own and fail to hear the opposing\nargument--then I remember that Jensen had a charity, a patience, a\nkindliness, almost as great as Sears had--\"\n\n\"Tocwright,\" said Pakriaa, half amused, \"why do you search yourself?\nMust you always be sitting in judgment on your own mind?\"\n\n\"Why, yes, dear, I must.\" His fingers played in his white beard.\n\"Cod-and-baked-beans origin.... Remember my fussy little _History of\nthe Americas_, the first book Dorothy and Nisana copied out for me\nwhen we found how to make good paper from the marsh grass...? But\nself-searching is a vice-and-virtue not limited to the Charin tribe,\nPakriaa--ask yourself. And ask Elis.\" The black giant smiled.\n\"So--I'll go on with it just a little. Paul, is it weakness in me to\nask that when we find Ed Spearman, you do most of the talking? I want\nto be--merely friendly if I can, not say much. At least until we know\nwhat sort of man he's become. Nine years ago, I don't think he ever\nhad much resentment against you. You hear both sides--usually the\nsurest way to make an extremist hate you bitterly, but somehow people\ndon't. You're a--kindly listener; I only try to be, pushing down a big\npart of my natural temperament to do it.... Why, I think I never even\nappreciated the full nastiness of sarcasm until one time (it's not\nsuch a small matter)--one time on the space ship, when Sears\nreproached me for it: something that went against his own nature, by\nthe way, because he was always too afraid of finding fault with\nothers.\"\n\n\"I'll talk with him first, Doc, if you want me to. But I wonder what I\ncan say. I keep seeing Ann. The things she told us--he things Miniaan\nhas told us today.\"\n\n\"A city that never was,\" said Miniaan sleepily, \"never was even in the\nold times. Maybe I dreamed it. If you are quiet, maybe I will allow us\nto wake up in a moment on the island of Adelphi....\"\n\n\"Ann is not changed,\" Muson reflected, \"even though the baby died.\"\n\nMijok said, \"I'm not sure. I think she is. In what way I can't define.\nBut she's not the same sad little thing I watched when she was\nsleeping in that fever. Well now, that was truly long ago. She puzzled\nme more than the rest of you, and you were all a great mystery--and I\nwith a dozen words and the old terrors crawling on my skin like lice.\nMaybe it was her seeming weakness, her secret look of listening--which\nI thought I began to understand when she taught me the Earth music,\nbut I don't suppose I ever did understand it.\" Mijok laughed and\nlooked away. \"Doc, it was very difficult for me to grasp that you were\nnot begotten out of the west wind by a thunderbolt. You'll never know\nhow difficult, because you were never a savage. You were born to be\narticulate. Those twenty thousand years of blundering--bad I don't\ndoubt they were, but they gave you something. I am as if the forest\nhad generated me, with no past.\"\n\nMiniaan murmured and rolled over on her back to look up into the\nleaves. \"I too. I was never born. Someone with no father nor mother\nlooked at that filthy mound they say is the grave of the Queen of the\nWorld. The mind of a white-furred Charin is my father and my mother.\"\n\nElis suggested: \"Ann has come neater to the immediate present.\"\n\n\"Why, Elis--\" Pakriaa was surprised. \"She said something like that to\nme herself, a short while before we came away. She said, 'My\nyesterdays became tomorrows before I lived them. I want to find today,\nPakriaa. Where is today?'\"\n\nMiniann pursued the dark stream of her own thought, which now seemed\nto be giving her pleasure and not pain: \"This morning I found how\nyesterday can bury itself with only the smallest scattering of years.\nThere will be other cities. Never again Vestoia.\"\n\nWright asked gently, \"But you can remember good and pleasant things of\nthe old city, the way it was when you were young there?\"\n\n\"Oh, I can, I can. But I'll have today, too. I think I found it first\nwhen I bore my little sons, at Adelphi.\" She sat up, leaning on\nPakriaa's shoulder. \"I've had good todays at Adelphi. I don't\nunderstand how it could have been abandoned by this Spearman I've\nnever seen.\"\n\n\"In a way,\" Paul said, \"you did see him. You were one of those who\ncame on the canoes up Lake Argo. You saw the boat set your fleet\nafire.\"\n\n\"Yes. That was war.... And before I was wounded I killed, I think,\nseven of your people, Pakriaa. One with a blue skirt. I wounded her in\nthe throat, and I have heard she died in the forest, looking north.\"\n\n\"Yes, Tamisraa. My sister Tamisraa was a bitter woman,\" Pakriaa said,\n\"and quite brave. Miniaan, all that was over long ago, in a forgotten\ncountry. Now we pull weeds in the same garden.\"\n\nNight came tranquilly. Elis, who kept the last quarter of the watch,\nwaked them before first-light. There was the help of a full red moon,\nand they followed the sound of a swift river which flowed into North\nLake through the palace district of Vestoia.\n\nFor more than a mile outside the city the jungle was like a park,\nundergrowth removed, vines cut away. But the vines were coming back.\nGreedy purple fingers curled to recapture and reclaim....\n\nIn the outskirts no one halted or questioned them. They saw no armed\nwomen; here and there a man crouched in a weedy doorway with staring\nchildren half hidden behind him. Mijok, Elis, Sears-Danik and Arek\nwalked on the outside, with shields upheld against a possible arrow or\nthrown spear. Rifles and pistols were now history, all ammunition\nspent; they lay in a closet off Wright's room at Adelphi which he\ncalled the Terrestrial Museum. Paul, Wright, and Elis had Earth-made\nhunting knives, still keen. Miniaan, leading them, held a spear, but\nthere was a blue-flower garland below its blade, symbol of peace.\nPakriaa and Nisana preferred to carry no weapons; Muson and young\nDunin had never handled one in their lives. Miniaan said over her\nshoulder, \"There is the old stockade. Here we turn right, toward the\npalace.\"\n\nThere was scurrying and disturbance now. Beyond Mijok's shield Paul saw a\nfew lean women running; one of them halted at Miniaan's call and approached\nuneasily. There were questions, dubious replies. At the far end of the\nshaded avenue was a growing cluster of red bodies before a thatched\nbuilding with one tall doorway. Miniaan explained: \"I told her that we come\npeacefully and want to talk with Spearman-abron-Ismar. And she says she\nthinks he would be asleep at this hour.\"\n\n\"So?\" Wright frowned and fretted. \"But the word you left yesterday\nwould certainly have reached him.\" The Vestoian twittered a last word\nor two and ran away down the street; Paul saw her elbowing through the\ncrowd in front of the palace. \"We might go forward a little....\"\n\nMost of the group melted away; some forty armed women remained, in a\nragged formation blocking the entrance. They made no threatening or\neven warning gestures, but their staring was heavy and cold. The\nvolunteer messenger returned, pushing through them to speak again with\nMiniaan; once or twice a halting gabble of something like pidgin\nEnglish made Miniaan wave her hand impatiently. She turned to Paul.\n\"It seems Spearman told her to say that he is under the--the climate?\nThe weather? Is this meaningful?\"\n\nWright said, \"Tell him his third-born son is dead and the doorway of\nhis palace is too narrow for our friends. Wait.... He asked nothing\nabout Ann?\"\n\n\"She does not say so.\"\n\n\"I can send him no message. You see what I meant, Paul?\nPaul--you--send whatever word you think best.\"\n\n\"Well.... Miniaan, ask her to tell him that--Ann could not come with\nus. That we want to talk with him and, as Doc said, that his door is\ntoo narrow for some of us.\"\n\nThe soldiers seemed to catch a glimmering of it; they made way for the\nmessenger, and it might be there was less suspicion in them, more\ncuriosity. Sears-Danik, Tejron's dreamy eldest boy, whispered to Paul,\n\"I am trying to remember him. Not much hair on his head--it was brown.\nI was only seven when he flew us to Adelphi. His voice--heavy.\"\n\n\"Yes. His hair may be gray now, Danny, as mine is. His face will look\nolder--it never had a young look. His body will not have changed\nmuch.\"\n\nDunin asked, \"He is older than you?\"\n\n\"No, dear, a little younger.\"\n\nBut Spearman seemed older by far, appearing abruptly in the doorway,\narms spread against its frame, face thrust intently forward and eyes\nsquinting as if they troubled him. He wore a black loincloth of bark\nfabric, nothing else. His sparse hair was wholly gray with streaks of\nwhite at the temples, his cheeks, leathery, deeply grooved, and\nflushed. \"I didn't believe her,\" he said. Seeing him, the guards held\ntheir spears as if they were Earth-born soldiers presenting arms, then\ngrounded the butts; they remained rigidly at attention when Spearman\npaid them no heed. \"I didn't suppose....\" Spearman hiccuped; he rubbed\nboth hands across his face.\n\nSeeing tormented uncertainty in Christopher Wright, Paul stepped\nforward. \"Sears died, long ago. Doc and I got through, with--some of\nour friends.\" He paused, short of the guards, and held out his hand,\nand Spearman stared at it, communing somehow with himself, approaching\nat last, clumsily, to take hold of it in the old Earth gesture. There\nwas alcohol on his breath; his bloodshot eyes fought an open struggle\nwith bewilderment; his handclasp was damp, unsteady, quickly\nwithdrawn.\n\n\"Sorry,\" he said, \"not well. Hard to get it through my head.\nWell--Christ, I'm a bit drunk. Not strange, is it...? Mijok.\" His\nglance traveled over Pakriaa and Nisana without recognition; it\nlingered at Arek, but he did not speak her name. There was the\nbeginning of a stiff smile, unreadable, as his eyes fixed on\nChristopher Wright.\n\n\"Ann--reached us,\" Wright said, hardly audible. \"She--\"\n\n\"Why don't you speak up, man?\"\n\n\"She came along the coast,\" Wright said, not much more clearly. \"The\nbaby died--a little while before she reached us.\"\n\nSpearman blinked, glanced at his hands, let them drop. He noticed the\ntight soldiers; in the antique military manner of Earth he said, \"At\nease....\" The spearwomen relaxed part way, eyes front. \"Maybe,\"\nSpearman said, \"maybe you came too soon.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Paul asked. \"We had to come as soon as we knew you\nwere alive.... Are your other children well, Ed? Are they here?\"\n\n\"Oh...? Yes, I see.... You came too soon. I still have a little town\nof seven or eight thousand and some very loyal followers.\"\n\nWright struck his fist into his palm. \"We are not your enemies. We\nnever were. There was a place for you at Adelphi. There is now.\"\n\n\"Oh...? I can imagine it. So--Ann--\"\n\n\"Ann came back to us. It took her a hundred days, she says. She\nwas--is--skin and bone--\"\n\nPaul said, \"She'll recover, Ed. Only needs rest and food. She wants\nJohn and David--naturally. They're her children too, Ed.\"\n\nSpearman said almost absently, \"Are they?\"\n\n\"What!\"\n\n\"I don't exactly believe your story, you know.... You must have\nbeen--watching--for a long time.\"\n\nBehind him Paul heard Nisana's miserable whisper: \"What is it? What is\nit?\" And Wright's muffled answer: \"A sickness.\"\n\n\"There's no truth in that, Ed,\" Paul said. \"Five days ago we still\nsupposed that you and Ann were lost when the lifeboat went down in the\nchannel.\"\n\nSpearman shrugged. \"Yes--I think you've come too soon. You should\nhave worked longer in the dark. We had an epidemic here. Many died.\nAnd another trouble--mental--well, you've kept track of that, of\ncourse: the way they've fallen away from me, gone back to the forest\nand the old life, when I could have given them a golden age. A prophet\nwithout honor.\" He coughed and straightened heavy shoulders. \"My God,\nI can't blame the poor fools--now that I know how it was done.\" His\nvoice did not rise. \"Without the conspiracy and interference, I could\nsoon have started them in building a ship that--Never mind that now. I\nhave the designs, of course. That what you came for?\"\n\nMijok broke in, utterly bewildered: \"What are you saying?\"\n\nSpearman dismissed the giant with a stare and a voice of cold\npoliteness: \"I don't blame you either. I remember you well. I suppose\nyou had to do whatever your god ordered, without question....\"\n\nThe twin boys had appeared in the doorway, dressed like their father\nin bark fabric: slim, well-knit children, thin-faced like Ann, nine\nEarth years old. They halted uncertainly, perhaps driven by curiosity\nto violate an order of their father's. Paul tried to smile at them,\nand one responded but then blushed and looked worriedly away with a\nhand over his mouth; the other stared like a pygmy without expression.\nSpearman did not appear to notice them, though Paul's smile must have\ntold him of their presence. Elis broke the silence: \"Mijok and the\nothers of my people do not create gods. We live by our own light so\nfar as it reaches, without fear of the mysteries beyond it.\" His\nvoice, so seldom loud in anything but laughter, boomed and echoed back\nfrom the thatched walls. \"At Adelphi, orders derive from the laws,\nwhich are made by all of us and understood by all of us.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Spearman nodded, upper lip drawn in, as one who saw his saddest\npredictions verified. \"Yes, he would teach you to say that.\"\n\nArek said disgustedly, \"There's no conversation here. He listens to\nhis own mind, no other's. As it was on the beach, years ago--I\nremember--\"\n\nSpearman said sharply, \"Wright, be careful! You've brought your\nbullies here, but I ought to warn you, this is the country where I\nstill rule. There are some left who love me and understand me.\"\n\nDunin muttered to Paul, \"Bullies--what word is that?\" Paul squeezed\nher wrist, a warning to be silent.\n\nSpeaking with care and difficulty, Wright said, \"Ed, your boys are\nabout nine, Earth time. Would you say that is old enough to make\ncertain decisions? Would you be willing, Ed, to ask them whether they\nwant to go to Adelphi and see their mother again?\"\n\nSpearman glanced back at them. He would be seeing, Paul knew, how the\nboy who had smiled was staring at Wright with his mouth fallen open,\nhow the other's blank look had crumpled into a grimace foretelling\ntears. \"Now I really understand it!\" Spearman said softly. \"So it was\na kidnaping--a real kidnaping. I simply would not believe it when my\nmessengers came from Spearman City--but I should have known, I should\nhave known. You stole Ann in order to get my children too, for your--\"\n\nThere was a murmuring among the guard and in the crowd of pygmy\nspectators who had gathered at a safe distance. Uncomprehendingly,\nPaul saw a few wildly pointing arms, saw one of the guards throw away\nher spear and run blindly down the street. Others were doing the same.\nThe swelling murmur was broken by thin screams. Those of the guard who\nremained were staring into the northeast quarter of the sky, where a\nbreak in the trees permitted a view of it, and they were\ntransfixed--the guard and Spearman's boys and now Spearman himself,\nglaring at that blue patch of morning heaven with total unbelief. But\nthen Spearman did believe it, was perhaps the first to believe it,\ntears starting from his gray eyes and running unregarded down the hard\nchannels of his face. \"From home! Home--oh, my God, so long a\ntime...!\"\n\nThe spot seemed small and slow in its descent, riding on a cushion of\nflame brighter than sunlight....\n\nThe Vestoian pygmies were all running now. Not into their houses, nor\nthe palace, but away down the tree-sheltered streets, a mindless\nstampede, weapons tossed away with an agonized crying of tiny voices.\n\nPaul's eyes found it, held it, saw the white flame change to a vast\noutpouring of brilliant green like the burning of copper.\n\"Charlesite!\" Spearman cried. \"They've found how to use charlesite for\nbraking! No radioactivity.\"\n\nThe ship must be aiming for the open ground twenty miles away. They\ncould hear the roaring now, almost gentle with distance.\n\nArek's red arm became a warmth over Paul's shoulders. She said, \"I'm\nafraid.\"\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nThe gap in the leaves was blank, the green flame gone. Edmund Spearman\ngazed at the spot where the descending ship had been, unaware of his\nsons, unaware that his pygmy followers had been scattered by fear as\nswallows are scattered by a storm; unaware, Paul guessed, of the two\nmen who had been friends and now were strangers--but these he\npresently saw again. His gray eyes measured Paul and Wright, the\nunspeaking giants, the small shaken figures of Pakriaa and Nisana and\nMiniaan, as if they were rocks or tree stumps and his only problem how\nto step around them. Addressing Wright and Arek, whose big arm was\nstill warm around his shoulders, Paul said carefully, \"It will come\ndown on the meadow ground about twenty miles from here. They must have\nseen Vestoia from the air; they probably made sure there was no\nsettlement in the open land.\"\n\nWright whispered, \"It may not even have been from Earth.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" Mijok's black lips smiled. \"It is, Doc. I forget our eyes are\nbetter at distance. You didn't see the letters? Black on silver,\nreaching halfway up the body of the ship. J-E-N-S-E-N.\"\n\n\"So?\" In Wright's face was a sudden blaze of belief.\n\nSpearman stared. He said, \"Quite an imagination. Glad it was you who\nmade it up, and not one of the men who knew the real Jensen--a name\nthat ought not to be taken in vain.\"\n\n\"I have good eyes,\" said Mijok gently. \"I made up nothing.\"\n\nSpearman's eyebrows lifted, a fury of mimic politeness. He stepped\naround the group as if they were not rocks but dangerous animals. He\npassed down the street in long strides, not looking back even for his\nsons. Paul stupidly watched him go, saw him reach the turning by the\nmeat-slave stockade and break into a loping run. Stout Muson muttered,\n\"So changed! What sickness could make such a change?\"\n\nWright said, \"It is not likely to pass. In the old days of Earth they\nsometimes ruled nations. Or they were put away in institutions,\nusually after others had been injured. Or they were fanatics of one\nsort and another, ridden by the devil of one idea. My profession\nlearned a little about them--never enough. The law met them more often\nand learned less.\" He watched Paul, perhaps needing contact with a\nCharin mind, since the innocence of the others gave them no frame of\nreference. \"I dare say Ed is paranoid only on the one point,\ntechnically: all his troubles are caused by me and my--what did he\nsay?--conspiracy. A means to help him believe that only he is right\nand virtuous and the universe wrong.... It is not so much a sickness,\nMuson, as the sum of years of mental bad habits. Vanity and dislike of\none's own kind make most of the seed, and this is the fruit.\"\n\nElis said, \"We can overtake him. Six of us giants--we can carry you,\novertake him in a walk, if you think best.\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Wright watched the empty street and Spearman's palace that\nalready seemed haunted and forlorn. \"I believe there's no need for\nhaste. Twenty miles....\" The Vestoian pygmies were not returning; the\nstreet was a desolation of rubbish and loneliness with the dull smell\nof neglect. One of Spearman's boys was whimpering; the other watched\nthe place where his father had disappeared, a tension in his small\nface, without forgiveness. Wright said, \"Who's John and who's David?\"\n\nThe crying one muttered, \"I'm John.\"\n\nDavid spoke as if the words had been shaken out: \"He said she wouldn't\never come back. Where is she?\"\n\n\"At our island,\" Paul told him. \"She's all right, David, and we're\ngoing to take you to her. You want that, don't you?\"\n\n\"Is _he_ going there?\"\n\n\"We don't know, David. You want to go with us, don't you?\"\n\n\"He hit her face. When she said it was his fault that they were all\ngiving up the city. He always had the guards. Six sat around his bed\nevery night. John and me, we tried. We made a grass picture like the\npriest Kona told us to do, and did things with it and burned it. It\nwas no good.\"\n\nArek said, \"Let's forget that for now. We're going to the new ship and\nthen the island. Shall I carry you? I've got two boys your age.\"\n\n\"Who're you? I never saw anybody like you.\"\n\nShe dropped on one knee, not too close to him. \"I'm like you, David.\nJust big and furry, that's all.\"\n\n\"Your mother, David\"--said Wright, and swallowed--\"your mother is\nliving in my house now. She was our friend long before you were born,\nyou know. She came from Earth with us.... You're with us, aren't you?\"\n\nThe boy scuffed his bare feet in the dust. John was still crying.\nDavid slapped him savagely. \"You stop yakking, y'son of a bitch.\" The\nwords could have no meaning for him, Paul thought, beyond the\ngeneralized stink of profanity. John stopped and rubbed his cheek\nwithout apparent anger, gulping and then nodding. When Arek reached,\nDavid let her pick him up, and he relaxed and buried his face in her\nfur....\n\nThe giants made little of the miles. Mijok had Pakriaa and Nisana in\nhis arms and Miniaan perched on his shoulder. They had traveled often\nthat way on the troublesome journey to Vestoia. Elis carried Wright's\ntrifling 140 pounds, and Muson had John, her slow voice establishing\ncautious friendship. Paul preferred to walk on his own feet, but\nbefore long Sears-Danik stole up behind and swept him into a living\ncradle. \"Slow legs. Don't mind, do you, Pop?\"\n\n\"Pop, huh? No, I don't mind, Danny. I was getting fifty-year-old\ncramps and too dumb to admit it.\"\n\nDunin chuckled. \"That's Danny: knows all, sees all, says nuf'n'. I'd\nlive with him awhile when he grows up if only he wasn't so lazy.\"\n\n\"What's wrong with being lazy?\"\n\n\"Not a thing, rockhead. Only if you're going to explore, the way I am,\nyou can't be lazy, the way you are.\" She twisted a branch into a leaf\ncrown and walked backward before them, trying the crown on the boy's\nhead at different angles. \"Ah, wonderful! Charging asonis--whuff\nwhuff--and now you look just like the kink that chewed up my diary to\nmake a nest.\"\n\n\"Which was your fault for leaving it on a shelf and not writing in it.\nExplorers have to keep diaries. Doc said so--didn't he, Paul?\"\n\n\"I'm strictly neutral, to avoid bouncing.\"\n\n\"So anyway, Dunin, when you trip over a root and smack your fanny, I'm\ngoing to laugh.\"\n\nShe did. He did....\n\nIt was an hour before they overtook Spearman, who glanced back without\nexpression, without halting his powerful strides, his tanned body\ngleaming with sweat and effort. Dunin sobered; she caught Paul's eyes.\nShe said, \"May I carry you, Spearman? Then we can all reach the ship\nat the same time.\"\n\nSpearman gave no sign of hearing her. He drew up at the side of the\ntrail, staring at the ground, arms folded. David's face was hidden\nagain at Arek's breast; John seemed to be asleep. Dunin said, \"Please?\nWhy should we leave you behind?\"\n\nRemote and desolate, Spearman watched the ground. Dunin moved on,\nreluctantly, no more laughter in her. \"What _is_ he thinking?\"\n\nWright said, \"At this moment he's probably thinking it's brutally\nunfair that we should go on ahead of him.\"\n\n\"But I asked--\"\n\n\"You did. What's more he hasn't anything against you. All the same,\nthat's about what he'll be thinking. Don't try too hard to understand\nit, Dunin--I'm not sure it's worth it. Let's think about the ship.\nPaul, is it possible, what he said about charlesite?\"\n\n\"I reckon so, Doc. The flame certainly did change to green. I think I\nremember, long ago, hearing some engineers discuss the possibility of\nstepping up charlesite enough so it could be used in braking a big\nship for descent, instead of keeping the atomics on all the way down.\nIt would char everything over a wide area, but at least it wouldn't\nmake radioactive desert....\"\n\n\"I can't feel it,\" Wright mumbled. \"Mirage....\"\n\nIt was no mirage. The ship _Jensen_ stood high above blackened ground\nhalf a mile away; even here at the edge of forest there was a\nlingering smell, anciently familiar. Paul felt himself grinning\nstupidly. \"Plain carbon tet or something like it. Must have shot it\nout to kill any grass fires. No mirage.\"\n\nTowering silver-white above a hundred-foot tripod, it flaunted the\nletters of a great name, and David Spearman rubbed his eyes at it,\nleaning against Arek's knee, accepting the protective touch of her\nhand. Arek said, \"What--Oh Paul, what will they be like?\"\n\nWright shook his head, plainly feeling it now--the thought, the\nmemories, the pleasure, and something far from pleasure. Paul\nanswered, \"They will--look like us, Arek.\"\n\nPakriaa pointed up. \"There! That we remember. Oh, the beautiful--\"\n\n\"A boat out already?\" Paul searched and found the silver flight.\n\nWright chattered: \"Have we anything, anything white? No--you and I out\nin the open, Paul--rest of you keep back. They need to recognize what\nwe are--\" He was shaking, and Paul embraced his shoulders to steady\nhim as they moved into the open ground. Wright giggled hysterically.\n\"Damn white flag myself--my whiskers--\"\n\nThe boat swooped, swelling from a dot to keen familiar lines; it\ncircled above them twice and came to earth in a perfect landing a\nhundred feet away. A blank pallor in the pilot's window would be a\nhuman face; there would be a human brain shocked into new wonder. It\nwas still necessary for Paul to help his teacher through the grass,\nfor Wright was swaying and stumbling. Paul reminded him: \"They'll be\nsealed up, afraid of the air.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes. I say they needn't be--we have good air on Lucifer....\"\n\nPaul was aware of his own struggle for sanity, for clarity in the\nbeginning of this impossible joy which was not pure joy. He heard\nhimself shout at the top of his strong lungs: \"'Ahoy the _Jensen_!'\nNo, they won't hear it. Yes--they did, they did.\"\n\nThe door slid open for a meeting of two worlds. A square little bald\nman, a tall gray-haired woman who fussed at her ears, troubled by the\nchange in atmospheric pressure. Faded overalls, the human look,\nincredulous stares changing to belief. The bald man gulped and\nstumbled; he grinned and held out his hand. \"Dr. Christopher Wright, I\npresume?\"\n\nWright could neither speak nor let go the hand. The woman said, \"You\nmust be--well, who could forget the photographs?--you're Paul Mason.\"\n\n\"Yes, We never--for years we haven't even thought--\" \"Mark Slade,\"\nsaid the bald man, \"Captain Slade. This is Dr. Nora Stern.... Sir,\nI--you are well? You look well--\"\n\n\"We are well,\" said Wright.\n\n\"I'm afraid to ask--the others? Dr. Oliphant? Captain Jensen? The--the\nlittle girls? And there was a young engineer--Edmund Spearman....\"\n\nPaul managed to say, \"Both little girls are mothers. Dr. Oliphant and\nCaptain Jensen died--Jensen on the ship, in the last acceleration.\nSpearman is--will be here before long, I think. You may find him\nsomewhat changed--\" Wright said, \"We must let Ed speak for himself,\nPaul.\" In spite of the shock, the newness, Dr. Stern was sensitive to\nnuances. She said too loudly, \"Beautiful country.\" She pressed both\nhands to her ears and took them away and spoke in a normal voice:\n\"There...! Oh, what strange steep hills...!\"\n\n\"N-not like any rock of Earth,\" Paul stammered. \"Defies erosion.\" _And\nI am speaking with the pride of a home lover...._ \"The open ground is\na little dangerous--flying carnivores. Come and meet our friends.\"\n\nCaptain Slade had already seen the giants and pygmies at the edge of\nthe woods; his small monkey face was ablaze with friendly curiosity\nand the startled amusement that will wake at anything new, but he\nsaid, \"In just a moment. Let me take this in. If I can.... We've done\nit, Nora.\" He filled his lungs deeply, blinking at a few tears of\npleasure. \"A world like ours--a new world. Oh, Nora, it'll be a long\ntime before we can believe this, you and I.... High oxygen, we\nnoticed--feels like it. Sir, your ship--\"\n\n\"Lost,\" said Wright, tranquilly now, no longer shaking from head to\nfoot. \"Out of control in descent, fell in a lake\"--he motioned over\nhis shoulder--\"a few miles over there. We call it Lake Argo. Too deep\neven to think of salvage. One of the lifeboats cracked up; we used the\nother for about a year. Our friends, Captain--you'll like our\nfriends--\"\n\nSlade murmured, \"Speculation on parallel evolution seems to have been\nsound--here anyway. Humanoid, I see. Two species?\"\n\n\"Human,\" said Wright. \"Their English, by the way, is better than mine.\nThey are close to us, Captain--very dear to us.\"\n\n\"I--see,\" said Captain Slade kindly. Paul thought: _He can't see--it's\ntoo new. But maybe he will try to see_.\n\n\"How many in your party, Captain?\"\n\nSlade grinned. \"Only four, Mr. Mason.\" _Heavens! Mister? That's me._\n\"A smaller crew, bigger ship. Federation thought best. We left\nthirteen years after you. Twelve years on the journey. Of course we've\nhad to double in brass considerably. The other two are a young\ncouple--Jimmy Mukerji; he's from Calcutta--Oh, and by the way, Dr.\nWright, his mother was Sigrid Hoch, anthropologist, one of your\nstudents.\"\n\n\"Sigrid--\" Wright groped in the past. \"Of course. I remember.\" But\nPaul guessed that he did not.\n\n\"Jimmy's a botanist _and_ engineer _and_--oh, general technician, good\nanywhere. Sally Marino--another good technician. Frankly I didn't want\nspecialists--wanted kids who could turn a hand to anything, and I got\n'em.\" Slade's friendly face saddened; he and Dr. Stern were walking\nclumsily to the woods, feeling the change in gravity. \"Ours was to be\nthe last interstellar ship, Dr. Wright, until either you or we came\nhome. There'll be no building going on now. A Federation\ndecision--matter of public opinion as well as economics. Well, the old\nlady over there did cost twice as much as your _Argo_, upped the\nFederation poll tax three per cent just to pay for her on paper. Could\nhave got around that, maybe, but there was a beginning of public\nhysteria, protest--resentment at the idea of throwing lives and\nbillions into space with nothing to show for it for many years.\nFanatics on both sides, and both noisy, plus the war scare of course.\nShort-term thinking. Human.\"\n\n\"You can't blame them,\" said Nora Stern.\n\n\"I do blame them, Nora, now that we know it can be done....\"\n\nElis had tried to be ready with a little speech of welcome, but\nshyness made him stiff with dignity, and it was evident that Dunin\nwould break loose in nervous giggling. Elis said only, \"You're very\nwelcome. We hope you'll enjoy it here.\" Pakriaa might have been back\nin the days of tribal grandeur, but her control too was only a result\nof shyness and wonder as she echoed the Governor's words. It was\nunfairly difficult for the newcomers, Paul could see--the giants'\nfurry nakedness and majesty, the pygmies' tininess and wrinkled\nbaldness; even the Charin-like beauty of Miniaan's features might be\ninvisible to new Charin eyes. But Slade and Dr. Stern behaved well,\nwith a natural friendliness. \"Why,\" said Slade, \"these boys--\"\n\n\"John and David Spearman,\" Paul explained. \"Ann's boys. Spearman--we\nthink he'll be here shortly.\"\n\nArek asked evenly, \"You've come to stay, I hope?\"\n\n\"To--stay?\" Slade shot a startled glance at Wright, who avoided it,\ngiving him no help.\n\nPaul said quickly, \"Captain, we ought to have warned you, but neither\nDoc nor I could get our wits together until you'd opened the door.\nAbout thirteen or fourteen hours from now you'll have a fever and a\nperiod of unconsciousness. Not too much discomfort and, so far as we\nknow, no danger--anyhow all of us recovered in fine shape and we've\nhad excellent health ever since. We decided it's just a part of\nacclimation to--we call this planet Lucifer. But if you think the two\nothers should stay in the ship till you recover--\"\n\nDr. Stern was measuring him shrewdly. \"You look very healthy, both of\nyou, and I know we can take your word for anything. Jimmy and Sally\nare pretty rugged. They'll be wild to join us. Sally will be at the\nintercom right now, tearing her pretty hair out in handfuls. They\nmight as well chance it with us.... Where do you people live? We saw\na--settlement? Over there south of the lake.\"\n\nWright glanced at Paul with vague entreaty. It was Miniaan who spoke,\nthe small silver of her voice a music in the sun-streaked shadow:\n\"The settlement below the lake is a thing of the past, an empire that\ndied. We live on a warm island over yonder, the other side of those\nmountains, the island Adelphi. We are returning there now, after\na--journey with some trouble in it.\"\n\n\"Adelphi,\" said Dr. Stern, savoring the name. \"Mark--our two boats\ncould fly them all there with us, couldn't they? Take out the\nemergency stuff to make room.\"\n\n\"It would be wise,\" said Paul. \"We could take better care of you\nduring the illness, at Adelphi. We have houses there. Here it's not\nvery safe--biting flies and some dangerous animals.\"\n\nSlade was doubtful. \"Anything here that could interfere with the ship\nif we leave it unguarded?\"\n\nMiniaan laughed. \"Certainly the people of Vestoia will not go near\nit.\"\n\n\"Nothing could harm it,\" said Wright. \"Too big. How in hell do you get\ndown out of it?\"\n\nSlade chuckled and made up his mind. \"Electronic lock. Can work it\nfrom a transmitter in the lifeboat; only other way's from inside. Lets\ndown a ladder. Automatic derricks in the side blisters to hoist the\nlifeboats if, as, and when. They thought of--_nearly_ everything.\" He\nhugged the gray-haired woman. \"Even briefing on how to get along with\neach other for ten-plus years.\"\n\n\"Learning love can be difficult,\" said Pakriaa. Dr. Stern stared at\nthe tiny woman with new intentness. Pakriaa's seamed face had taken on\nits dreamy look. \"You must see our island. Last year Mashana Dorothy\nwas Governor of our island. This year it is this man.\" She touched\nElis' knee.\n\n\"A sinecure,\" Elis chuckled. \"A sinecure, ladies'n' gentlemen.\"\n\nCaptain Slade laughed, standing five feet five, peering up at the\nGovernor's eight feet seven--half a head more than Mijok's height.\nPaul thought he saw there the raw materials of friendship. Dr. Stern\nsaid, \"And you call this planet Lucifer?\"\n\n\"Light-bringer,\" said Nisana; there was grief in her face not evident\nin any of the others. \"Son of the morning,\" Paul moved toward her,\nwondering.\n\nSlade had missed the overtone, and cocked a dark eyebrow.\n\"Industries?\"\n\nWright shrugged. \"A few, sir. All we seem to need at present in such a\nsmall community.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" Slade touched the old man's jacket. \"This is fine fabric. I\ncouldn't tell it from linen. Is it?\"\n\n\"Very similar.\" Wright took Nisana's hand on his palm. \"This lady is\nour best weaver because her hands are so small and sure. Our loom is\nclumsy because, of course, our metalworking is not far advanced. But\nit does good work for Nisana.\"\n\n\"I like to weave,\" Nisana whispered, looking here and there and not at\nPaul. \"I like to make new things.\"\n\nPaul glimpsed the twitch of Mijok's ears, the beckoning curve of a\ngray finger; Mijok whispered, \"He's coming, Paul. A few hundred yards\naway in the woods, breathing hard and limping. Is there nothing we can\ndo for him?\"\n\n\"I don't know, Mijok. I'm afraid whatever is done he must do for\nhimself, and it's late for that, very late.\" He saw that Mijok was\ntrying to understand and could not. \"His mind is--living in another\ncountry....\"\n\nBut outwardly at least, Edmund Spearman was changed. He even searched\nout Dunin's worried face and apologized. \"Should have accepted your\noffer--stupid of me.\" He smiled. \"Wanted to show what a walker I was,\nI guess.\" John and David slipped behind Muson's back, tense and cold.\nSpearman shook Slade's hand, and Dr. Stern's. \"My God, it doesn't seem\npossible. I can't take it in. Slade, you said? And Dr. Stern. We've\nwondered, dreamed, prayed for it. I can't tell you--I don't know what\nto say.... Good trip?\"\n\n\"Excellent.\" Slade hugged himself. \"Excellent beyond description. Ah,\nall the Federation needed was proof. They've got it now! Rather, they\nwill have it in twelve years. Lordy! I'll be fifty-one.\" He pounded\nPaul on the back, and Spearman, giving way to a bubbling overflow of\ngood nature. \"There'll be a new President, whole new Council I\nguess--and they won't be looking for us either, man.\" He danced a few\nsteps and jabbed Paul in the ribs. \"Think of it! Why, it's a Tom\nSawyer job. You know? You remember? When you and I walk up the middle\naisle in the Federation Hall--oh, man, man....\"\n\nPaul had to find Nisana's face again, and the devastation of sorrow in\nit, before he understood. He stooped quickly to whisper, \"I am not\ngoing back to Earth.\" The radiance in the aging red face was like a\nCharin girl's.\n\nAnd he heard Dr. Stern remark dryly, \"Mark, I believe we've got some\nnearer bridges to cross.\"\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nOne of the soft lizard-oil lamps gleamed in Kajana's room, though it\nwas late and the house was hushed. Paul had not been able to find\nsleep; Dorothy would be watching at the bedsides of the four\nunconscious newcomers from Earth for another hour, until Tejron\nrelieved her. Paul tapped at Kajana's never-closed doorway. \"May I\ncome in?\"\n\n\"Yes, please do.\" The little man smiled up from his pillows: they were\nfilled with a stuff like dandelion down, almost as good as feathers.\n\"Will you lift me a little?\" Paul fussed over him, glad of something\nto do. \"I was not sleepy. I finished transcribing from the shorthand,\nbut my thought remains with it.\"\n\n\"Shorthand--\"\n\n\"The talk of this afternoon. You didn't know I was recording it. You\nwere all speaking somewhat beyond yourselves, in a way I wanted to\npreserve. I wish we had better pencils. These last are not bad, blue\nclay mixed with the graphite, but they still crumble too easily and\nthe wood is big for my hand. I used the brown ink for the\ntranscription.\" He shuffled the gray marsh-reed pages together. \"You\nmight like to look at it.\"\n\n\"Yes. Tonight, I think. Doc did say some things worth remembering.\"\n\nKajana smiled. \"So did you.\"\n\n\"Did I...? Pencils are one thing they must have had on the ship in\nabundance. The library too. Poor Doc, he'd have given anything for the\nbooks--so would I....\"\n\nKajana patted his hand. \"Maybe it doesn't matter too much, Paul? We\nhave our own books to make.... Besides--don't you think Spearman may\nhave unloaded some things for us before he took off?\"\n\n\"Not a chance. His mind wouldn't work that way.\"\n\n\"No? Well, you knew him better. Still, he had time, Paul. He knew we\ncouldn't go after him: you told me he drained the fuel out of one\nlifeboat before he stole the other. And it was three hours, after you\nfound he was gone, before you saw the big ship go up over the range.\"\n\n\"And down,\" Paul said, still physically shaken with the memory, the\nsound, the sight of it. \"Down into the sea forever.\"\n\n\"What happened, do you think?\"\n\n\"We'll never know. It was a new type of ship. His knowledge of such\nthings was ten years old, Lucifer years. Likely the take-off was too\ncomplex for one man to handle it. After we saw it climb past the\nrange, we stayed there--Doc and Dorothy and Miniaan and I--near the\ntemple, just stayed there mind-sick and wondering. We saw it\nreappear--a dot, then a flame. He never quit trying. He had the\natomics blazing all the way down. Sometimes they'd lift the ship a\nlittle, and we--I suppose we weren't breathing--we'd think yes--no,\nyes--no. I even thought: is he going to crash it _here_? But he was\nreally many miles to the west, only seemed near, so bright in that\ndarkness. A meteor--yes, call him a meteor--burned out and lost. Up to\nthe very end, until we saw it strike the water near the western\nhorizon, he was still trying, a mad insect heaving against the web of\ngravity. And we'll never know what he really wanted, either. I have an\nidea he may not have meant to go back to Earth. I think perhaps he\nwanted another star--one that never was.\"\n\nAnd Paul wondered: _Should I tell Kajana what Doc said when it was all\nover? No, not now--not till I understand it myself._ (\"I consider\nmyself to blame.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"Remember when Arek noticed he\nwas gone? I saw him slip away ten minutes before she spoke. He looked\nat me, too. I think I may have known what he meant to do: I said\nnothing. Earth is a very distant place, Paul. The Federation is\nbuilding no more interstellar ships, for a while--for a while.\" \"But\nyou--\" \"I may therefore be to blame. I look within and am confused, as\nso often. But all the same, here in our world I have helped to\nestablish a few practical certainties.\" During that murmured\ninterchange by the temple, Dorothy had been quite silent, as if she\nneeded no question and answer, and Miniaan had ended it, saying,\n\"Let's go back, and tell the others that something has ended.\")\n\nKajana's old mind was roving after other matters, to him more\nimportant than Spearman or the beautiful lost ship from Earth.\n\"Teddy,\" he said, \"do you know, Paul, when the two silver boats came\nslipping down out of the sky Teddy only glanced at them once, and came\nrunning to carry me outdoors so that I could see them too. It was her\nfirst thought. Her father and mother in her, and what a new self\ntoo...!\" Kajana was having pain, from the old hip-joint injury that\nwould never heal. \"That transcription, Paul--it's quite verbatim, even\nto a little hemming and hawing.\"\n\n\"Good.\" Paul studied the wizened red face, regretful that his\npainter's power could never record what was really Kajana--too much\nthat must escape, even if the portrait were faithful to the small\npatient hands, the groove in the left fingers caused by years of\neffort with makeshift writing materials. Sears--and Paul could think\nit now without too much distress--Sears could have understood Kajana\nbetter. \"Can I get you anything?\"\n\n\"No, thank you, Paul. I'm very well tonight.\" But some other thought\nstirred in him, and Paul lingered, knowing what it was: a need for a\nparticular reassurance, Kajana's only outward concession to his\nfrailty. \"Paul, what do you really think? When the time comes, will it\nbe something like a sleep?\"\n\n\"I believe so, Kajana. But not soon. We need you.\"\n\nThe mild face showed gratitude, then calm; it glanced beyond him.\n\"Why, Abara--you should be snoring.\"\n\nAbara followed his comfortable potbelly into the room; his fluty voice\nwas indignant: \"I never snore.\" He sank cross-legged by the bed,\nrocking lightly with a foot in each hand.\n\n\"I've heard you, old man.\"\n\n\"Lizard-fur!\" said Abara. \"Hear yourself snoring, of course.\"\n\nPaul stretched. \"You gentlemen settle down to a good soothing quarrel.\nI'll take off.\" Abara's left eyelid lowered and lifted gravely. \"Good\nnight.\" \"Good night,\" said the little voices. Leaving the room, Paul\nheard Abara murmur, \"Do you remember....\"\n\nPaul carried a taper from the permanent fire in the common room to\nrelight the lamp in his and Dorothy's bedroom. It was late indeed,\nnear to the time of the rising of the red moon, seen only the night\nbefore from the jungle west of Vestoia--what had been Vestoia. Here in\nthe long room there was still a friendly disorder from the impromptu\nbanquet of the evening. Because of the disturbance when Spearman's\nflight was discovered and preoccupation with the illness of the\nnewcomers, the common room had received only a few housekeeping\nflurries. Mats were still scattered in the center of the floor;\nearthen wine cups stood about. Carrying the taper, Paul saw by his\nfoot a graded series of round faces drawn on the earth with a twig.\nHelen was apt to do that when most of her mind was elsewhere: the\nfaces were made of neat circles, even nose and mouth. Subject to a\npinch on the bottom from her half-sister, Helen called them teddies.\nPaul smiled sleepily and stepped around.\n\nKajana took pride in the sharp printlike quality of his writing; under\nlamplight, the brown ink shifted into gold. Kajana had not recorded\nthe casual beginning of the banquet: the idea had evidently come to\nhim after some remark of Kamon's. Paul could not remember it clearly,\nbut the old giantess had been roused to it by a thing the rather\nsad-faced, brown-haired girl Sally Marino had mentioned: the prospect\nof war on the planet Earth. Kajana had taken down what followed as\ndirect dialogue; riffling through the gray pages, Paul noticed that\nKajana had inserted no comment of his own at all. The phonetic\nshorthand, Paul knew, was Kajana's invention--ideal for his own use,\nbut he had not been able to teach it even to Nisana. Too intricate,\nshe said, needing the hyperacute ear which was a gift Kajana could not\nshare.\n\n     SLADE: There seems never to be a single cause of war, only a\n     group of causes coming to a particular focus in time. Our\n     world, madam--\n\n     WRIGHT: Just Kamon. Somehow we've never formed the habit of\n     courtesy titles, Captain. Names, nicknames, and a few titles\n     of function--as for instance, if Elis were conducting one\n     of our meetings, we'd address him as Governor.\n\n     SLADE: Oh. Pleasant, I should think. Our world, Kamon, is\n     still divided in two parts. An ideological division. There\n     is the Asian Empire of Jenga. Let me show you--the map--\n\n     DUNIN: Here. I grabbed it. And what a map! If only we could\n     make such things!\n\n     DOROTHY: In time, sugar. Takes mighty complex machinery to\n     make such a map.\n\n     SLADE: One of the things that must come on the next trip\n     from Earth. Well--here is the Asian Empire. You can see the\n     vastness of it, one land mass, almost all of a continent--\n\n     MUKERJI: Except my country.\n\n     NORA STERN: Well, naturally, Jimmy--\n\n     MUKERJI: I tend to be sensitive on the point since we joined\n     the Federation somewhat belatedly.\n\n     SLADE: That's the Asian Empire. And there they believe, and\n     have long believed, that individual man is nothing--an ant\n     in a colony--the state is everything, a sole reason for\n     existence. The state--\n\n     WRIGHT: Which exists only in the minds of individual men.\n\n     SLADE: Ye-es.... For them the state takes the place of God,\n     of reason, of ethics, of--Oh, it's be-all and end-all, so\n     far as an individualist like myself can understand their\n     doctrine. A hundred years ago this empire was two great\n     states; they had the same doctrine then but called it by a\n     less honest name, communism, derived from certain na\u00efve\n     social theories of about a hundred years earlier--\n\n     SPEARMAN: Na\u00efve?\n\n     SLADE: Before I went in for engineering, sir, I majored in\n     history at McGill. With the help of a great deal of coffee,\n     I even read _Das Kapital_. It is not logical even from its\n     own dogmatic premises. Incidentally I think it can still be\n     found in secondhand bookstores.\n\n     SPEARMAN: As a matter of fact, when I left Earth, it was\n     quite readily available in up-to-date editions from the\n     Collectivist Press.\n\n     SLADE: Oh. Yes, I dare say it was.... Well, Kamon, about a\n     hundred years ago those two Asian states, still paying lip\n     service to the--debatable doctrine of communism\n     (satisfactory, Mr. Spearman?)--attacked each other in a long\n     war, making use of recently discovered atomic weapons as\n     well as man-made pestilence and other devices. It was not\n     actually a doctrinal war, but simply a power struggle\n     between two tyrannies. It was hideous, incredibly\n     destructive, and the only saving thing about it was that it\n     prevented them from visiting the same disaster on the rest\n     of the world. Neither side won, of course; a few decades\n     later a new dictator--a little one-eyed zealot from\n     Mongolia--inherited the desolation and built on the ruins a\n     new monolithic state, which still exists.\n\n     AREK: But what actually was this theory--this communism?\n\n     SLADE: Oh, the theory. Originally an appeal to the\n     dispossessed. In the nineteenth century and earlier there\n     were masses of poor, widespread suffering and injustice, too\n     much economic and political power in the hands of a few, who\n     abused their power with stupidity and cruelty. Marx and\n     other theorists imagined, or said they imagined, that the\n     situation could be remedied by reversal--give power to the\n     dispossessed (the proletariat, as they called them) and\n     injustice would right itself. Why they imagined that the\n     proletariat was any more fitted to rule than its\n     oppressors--why they supposed it would not abuse power quite\n     as viciously--they never bothered to explain. Naturally the\n     realists among them weren't concerned with any Utopian\n     outcome: they simply saw the doctrine as a means to personal\n     power for themselves and used it accordingly. The first\n     important one of these was a furious little man named Lenin.\n     He may have believed his own theories for a while--there\n     seems to have been some short-lived experimentation with the\n     contradictions of actual communism when he first won power\n     in Russia--but absolute power corrupts absolutely, as\n     somebody said. The foundations of an old-new despotism were\n     well established before he died--and was unofficially\n     deified and kept in a glass case for the consolation of the\n     atheist faithful. Matter of fact, Arek, a good many things\n     in Earth history would make a cat laugh.... The actual cure\n     for the ugly situation that existed turned out to be a\n     gradual economic leveling combined with the (very slow and\n     difficult) growth of representative government--so that\n     there would be no swollen fortunes, no severe poverty, and\n     no heavy concentrations of unchecked political power. But\n     that was most undramatic procedure: it needed the work of\n     centuries. No bloody revolution could ever achieve such an\n     end, nor could any other evil means ever bring it any\n     nearer. In the Federation we begin to have--an approximation\n     of it. The Asian Empire is merely despotism, old and stale,\n     old as the Pharaohs, committed to the policy of violence and\n     carrying the burden of slavery under modern names: the\n     natural product of fanatic doctrine after the power-hungry\n     have taken it over and made use of it.\n\n     SPEARMAN: Jenga's empire is not collectivism. It is a\n     perversion of it.\n\n     ANN: If you'll excuse me--\n\n     DOROTHY: Honey, of course! I think you got up too soon. The\n     boys are in bed. Come on--let me tuck you in and fuss at\n     you....\n\n     STERN: She's been ill?\n\n     WRIGHT: Yes. For a long time. But now I think she--\n\n     SPEARMAN: What--\n\n     AREK: Captain, tell us about the other part of Earth, the\n     part you come from.\n\n     SLADE: Canada? Oh, you mean the Federation itself. It's very\n     great, miss--I mean, Arek. Let's have the map again, my\n     dear. All of North America--here--parts of South America,\n     the United States of Europe, Union of Islam, Japan, India,\n     parts of Africa outside of Islam--then over here there's\n     Australia and New Zealand, and here's the Republic of\n     Oceania. Almost all the rest of the world, you see. Here's\n     Federal City. Find it? Follow my finger east of\n     Winnipeg--lake country, and very lovely: I was born near\n     there. The city was planned and built new in 1985; seems\n     long ago, isn't really. And then, Arek, there are some small\n     countries which have preferred to keep their national unity\n     outside of the Federation instead of inside it, although\n     they're affiliated with us and there aren't any barriers to\n     travel and other intercourse. A somewhat technical\n     distinction, since local sovereignties are well enough\n     preserved within the Federation.\n\n     WRIGHT: Not entirely a technicality. At the time we left\n     Earth, there were some tendencies in the Federation that\n     could lead to overcentralization, even with the recognition\n     of limited powers. And too much emphasis on the admitted\n     glories of machine civilization. I think it's an excellent\n     thing that some parts of the world should be a little\n     insulated from the enthusiasms of material progress. The\n     Federation itself will be the better for it.\n\n     SLADE: Perhaps. I think I know what you mean, Doctor. I was\n     always a small-government man, myself. Still, under the\n     threat of Jenga--\n\n     STERN: I can't see it as much of a threat.\n\n     SALLY MARINO: I don't know....\n\n     STERN: The empire will break down sooner or later, of its\n     own rigidity.\n\n     SLADE: But while we wait for that, the Federation has to be\n     strong, in the military as well as other senses.\n\n     MUKERJI: If we do just wait for it.\n\n     STERN: Preventive war is an absurdity, Jimmy.\n\n     MUKERJI: Yes, but--\n\n     STERN: Gradualist methods. The Federation can afford to\n     wait. The same gradualist methods that made the Union of\n     Islam possible, so long ago.\n\n     PAUL: I don't think the leadership of Turkey was gradualist\n     exactly, Dr. Stem. It took thirty years after 1960, but\n     considering the problem, that was great speed. Only a people\n     with immense moral courage and good sense would have dared\n     to undertake it at all. They weren't fanatics; they weren't\n     ridden by the devil of one idea; they had to work with\n     intelligent compromise, temperate adjustments, yielding here\n     and sternness there and patience all the time--but once they\n     took up the task they didn't rest or let go, and by 1990\n     there was a healthy union ready for full membership in the\n     Federation.\n\n     SLADE: Yes, that was speed. I expect you've given your\n     friends here a pretty good account of Earth history?\n\n     PAUL: We've tried. I don't know if we can allow ourselves\n     more than a B-plus. The subject is too enormous, and all we\n     had were imperfect memories. In the midst of our own work\n     for Lucifer, which is--paramount.\n\n     WRIGHT: Not even books. Captain, when you showed us over the\n     ship, it was very difficult for my fingers not to steal a\n     lens and a pocketful of those microtexts....\n\n     SLADE: My dear friend! Why didn't you say so? All you want.\n     That's for your friends here, entirely. No need to take any\n     of our library back to Earth if they can use it.\n\n     WRIGHT: I--excuse me--I don't know what to say.\n\n     SLADE: And by the way, Doctor, before I forget again to\n     mention it: after you left--I think it was in 2060--they\n     perfected a new drug which actually makes the accelerations\n     quite bearable. I don't know too much about it. Muscular\n     relaxation is a factor, and Nora can tell you more about it.\n     But I understand that even for persons past the--optimum\n     age--\n\n     WRIGHT: A moment, please.... I cannot go back to Earth,\n     Captain Slade. You mean it with the greatest kindness but it\n     is impossible.\n\n     SLADE: Why, forgive me, I supposed--I took it for granted--\n\n     WRIGHT: My place is here. This is my work. These are my\n     people.\n\n     TEJRON: I knew--I knew--\n\n     WRIGHT: What, my dear? I don't understand.\n\n     TEJRON: Oh, I should keep silent: this is for you to decide.\n     But you've said it. You won't leave us.\n\n     WRIGHT: No. No, I won't ever leave you. This is my home.\n\n     SLADE: But--\n\n     SPEARMAN: Can't argue with the passion of an expatriate. The\n     grass is always greener--\n\n     PAUL: It could be no other way, Captain, at least for Dr.\n     Wright and me, and I'm certain my wife will say the same\n     when she comes back.\n\n     WRIGHT: In some ways, Captain, the distance between Earth\n     and Lucifer is greater than the simple light years between\n     our two stars.\n\n     SLADE: I'm--sorry. Wasn't expecting it, that's all. Let me\n     get used to the idea a little.\n\n     SPEARMAN: You can consider me neutral, Captain Slade. I have\n     no place on Lucifer. One more utopia. Idealism running\n     contrary to obvious facts. It will break up--fine-spun\n     intellectual quarrels--no central control.\n\n     PAUL: Until, sometime, a strong man takes over and makes an\n     empire out of it...?\n\n     WRIGHT: Please--\n\n     SPEARMAN: No comment....\n\n     STERN: If I might differ with you, Mr. Spearman, it seems to\n     me--after being shown over this lovely island--the\n     domesticated cattle and those wonderful white beasts--the\n     plantations and the houses--the perfect English and adult\n     thinking of our new friends--above all, the school--it seems\n     to me that Dr. Wright and his colleagues are realists of the\n     first water. Of course I'm strongly prejudiced in their\n     favor, because--well, during the twelve years of our journey\n     I dreamed constantly of some such achievement as this\n     myself. So it's like coming home. I'm a doctor, Mr.\n     Spearman; before I was chosen for the journey, I ran a\n     clinic. As an intern, I had a lot of ambulance and emergency\n     service at one of the big hospitals in Melbourne; I saw a\n     superabundance of--let's call them obvious facts. Now I\n     think the sunny quiet here, the good health and intelligence\n     of the children, the gardens, the devotion of these people\n     to each other and to their work, the searching thought\n     they've given to their laws and their future--I fancy those\n     are obvious facts too...?\n\n     WRIGHT: Man is neither good nor bad, but both. But he can\n     swing the balance.\n\n     STERN: Too right. I think I understand you, Doctor--why you\n     want to stay here. I think I understand it very well.\n\n     SLADE: I wouldn't urge you. It's only that I--took something\n     else for granted. Foolishly. Let me be just a listener.\n\n     ELIS: And let me fill your cup. You're behind us, Captain.\n\n     MINIAAN: The big jug is empty. How'd'at happen?\n\n     MUSON: Portrait of a fat woman going away with another big\n     jug.\n\n     PAUL: Bless you, lady.\n\n     MUSON: It was you that finished emptying it. I think.\n\n     NISANA: Couldn't have been me....\n\n     STERN: Are there any important physiological differences?\n\n     WRIGHT: Nothing of first importance. Minor differences in\n     blood chemistry, shape of hands and feet. Our friends have\n     the hind brain in the spinal column, which may be the\n     reason for their better muscular co-ordination and--you\n     know, Doctor, I have often wished that the human race of\n     Earth, which we call Charin, had more room in its head for\n     the expansion of the frontal lobes.\n\n     ELIS: I have a very high opinion of your frontal lobes,\n     Christopher Wright. I have noticed that sometimes a large\n     skull merely rattles.\n\n     STERN: Just the same the point is well taken.\n\n     PAUL: Might call it the miracle of the lobes and wishes.\n\n     PAKRIAA: Why don't you wait till Muson comes back...?\n\n     SALLY MARINO: Don't you--now, maybe this is a foolish\n     question--don't you have to work awfully hard--I mean, with\n     so few technical aids? The--oh, oil lamps, the necessarily\n     primitive--of course, you've done miracles to have as much\n     as you do have, starting from almost nothing. What I'm\n     trying to say, doesn't mere survival take up so much time\n     and effort that it--well, wears you down?\n\n     PAUL: We have shelter, clothing, enough to eat--\n\n     MINIAAN: And drink.\n\n     PAUL: What we call a family, Sally, is made up of members of\n     all three races. Such a unit may have seven or eight adults\n     or more. Shelter, food--the basic needs are supplied by each\n     family working for itself; the large family unit distributes\n     the labor pretty well; and, if any family was stricken with\n     misfortune (none has been so far) the others would all help\n     as a matter of course. Now, we do have the germs of\n     beginning industries in textiles, sugar--\n\n     MINIAAN: Wine making.\n\n     ABARA: The lady is pied.\n\n     MINIAAN: The lady is not pied. Only very happy, and Vestoia\n     is a dead city, and the little illuama will be making their\n     nests where--Oh, Abara, you venerable ruin, I love you, I\n     love you....\n\n     ABARA: Well, not right here in front of all these nice\n     people....\n\n     MUKERJI: Beautiful way of life. Oh, here's Muson. Have we\n     drunk to everybody? Seems as though we must have overlooked\n     somebody, earlier.\n\n     NISANA: I don't think so. Yes, we have. Let's drink to the\n     olifants.\n\n     WRIGHT: And their seven calves....\n\n     PAUL: In textiles, for instance--Nisana does no housework\n     because her worktime is at the loom; each household sends\n     somebody over to work in the fiber and sugar plantations\n     across the lake. The system works, Sally, in this very tiny\n     community where everyone knows and respects everyone else,\n     where all the laws and customs encourage the ironing out of\n     differences before they become serious. And so far, work has\n     never become oppressive. Most of it we enjoy; the boring,\n     unpleasing jobs are shared because we know they have to be\n     done and we don't want anyone to have to carry too much of\n     their weight. And so far, we don't hunger for the complex\n     and fascinating possessions we knew on Earth. Such hungers\n     will come. Communities will grow. The best laws will fail\n     sometimes; there will be disputes, mistakes, injustices. But\n     we are forewarned by memories of Earth. Doc, I'm trying to\n     say things you could say better--\n\n     WRIGHT: No. Go on.\n\n     PAUL: Well.... We plan, tentatively, a hundred family units\n     here at Jensen City, a population of maybe a thousand\n     adults, no larger. When that point is reached (several years\n     away) then we must plan and build another town, probably\n     here on the island. At that point we add new problems and\n     perplexities. We may not need a monetary system until there\n     are several towns; when we do, it will not develop\n     haphazardly, but with the aid of all past knowledge we\n     possess, for safeguard and guidance.\n\n     SLADE: And when there are fifteen or twenty such\n     communities?\n\n     PAUL: They will want an over-all government; a miniature of\n     a federal system, we suppose. A republic, with fully\n     functional representative procedures, checked and\n     safeguarded against every abuse of power. Because in all our\n     study and memories of history, we've found no other type of\n     government that can operate with fairness to majorities and\n     minorities alike and leave men as free as any social animal\n     can ever be free. For that matter, Captain, we sometimes\n     glance ahead to a time when there will be hundreds or\n     thousands of towns: a time when our great-grandchildren of\n     all three races may want to experiment with large cities,\n     elaborate industries. Such things will bring their own heavy\n     difficulties, but we have reason to hope that our\n     great-grandchildren will have the patience and courage to\n     solve them as they arise. Brodaa, tell them about the\n     school.\n\n     BRODAA: I am not good in exposition, Paul.... We\n     are--strict, Captain, that the children should learn all the\n     tested factual knowledge we can give them. They must read,\n     speak, write--clearly, precisely, honestly. We do not allow\n     them to leave a method half learned, a task half done. If\n     there is a question, they must search for an answer; if\n     there is no sufficient answer known, they must learn to test\n     the insufficient answers and wait judgment. My own language\n     has flaws--I am an old woman--I still go to school, to Paul,\n     Mashana Dorothy, Dr. Wright, to learn more for my own sake\n     and for the little ones I teach. They must learn the\n     fundamental methods and facts as soon as they can start to\n     think at all. We are never afraid of teaching any child too\n     much or too soon--we respect them. Oh, Mashana, I was\n     wishing you would return.\n\n     DOROTHY: Need has arisen for the Dope? What goes on more or\n     less?\n\n     ELIS: Education.\n\n     PAUL: How is--\n\n     SPEARMAN: How is she?\n\n     DOROTHY: She is asleep, Ed. Nothing to worry about.\n\n     PAKRIAA: She will be healed.\n\n     MIJOK: Education on Lucifer. Pakriaa and I have the\n     pleasantest part of the teaching, I think. We show them the\n     ways of the forest and the open ground, the plants and other\n     living things, how to hunt without cruelty or waste, how to\n     be safe and happy alone in the woods at night, when to fear\n     and not to fear. As Samis shows them the care of the tame\n     beasts, and the work in the plantations....\n\n     WRIGHT: I'll add a little too, though Brodaa could do it\n     better--\n\n     MUKERJI: Come here, kink.\n\n     DOROTHY: Why, he loves you! That one won't usually go to\n     anybody but Muson. His wife is due to have kittens and he's\n     blue about it.\n\n     MUKERJI: Kittens--kinkens--\n\n     DOROTHY: Just kittens. Seven at one whack. Oof--shet ma\n     mouf.\n\n     HELEN: Mother, if you looked at seven kittens now they'd be\n     fourteen.\n\n     DOROTHY: Such comment, from a lady allowed to sit up late.\n     Such, I might add, perfectly accurate comment. Sleepy, baby?\n\n     HELEN: Not a bit.\n\n     DOROTHY: You are too. You snuggle like a kitten half full of\n     milk. Half an hour, huh?\n\n     HELEN: Mm.\n\n     WRIGHT: We see to it, Captain, that our children are not\n     stuffed with inflated words, equivocal words. When you talk\n     with them, they won't be chattering to you about freedom,\n     democracy, truth, justice. They learn these words closely;\n     we see to it that they learn them with caution. When they\n     use them we say--define, define. Democracy by what means,\n     within what limits, toward what end? Freedom from what, for\n     what? For what's the profit if I rattle on about freedom in\n     a semantic vacuum? I am free to speak, not free to kill and\n     wound; I must be free from slavery to the whims of others. I\n     can never be free from the bonds of a hundred duties,\n     responsibilities, loyalties to persons I love and principles\n     I cherish. Words without definition are sheer noise, and\n     noise never drummed any race into Paradise. Oh, the thing's\n     obvious as a child's building blocks--but I recall how on\n     Earth men tended to forget it twenty-four hours a day, and\n     here on Lucifer we forget it often enough--myself included.\n     But we do not forget it when we teach our children.... One\n     other thing--before this wine takes me back to second\n     childhood--as soon, Captain, as their minds are old enough--\n\n     AREK: Where did Spearman go?\n\n     WRIGHT: Oh, he--he just stepped out, I think. Stretch his\n     legs or something. As soon as their minds are old enough to\n     think with some independence and explore, we insist that\n     they start the lifetime struggle with man's primary\n     dilemma--\n\n     ELIS: I hoped you would speak of that, my brother.\n\n     WRIGHT: That he is an individual, his self-hood precious and\n     inviolate, yet he must live in harmony with other\n     individuals whose right to life and welfare is as certain as\n     his own. Approach the study of society from any direction\n     you will, that problem is at the heart of it, and must be a\n     thousand generations from now, because it must be met anew\n     with every infant born. We think, here, that the most\n     rewarding answer is in the old virtues of self-knowledge,\n     charity, honesty, forbearance, patience. Now, those are all\n     words that demand definition and multiple definition; on\n     that basis we have our children study them, search the depth\n     and height of them, in the not so simple problems of\n     childhood through the tougher ones of adolescence and\n     maturity. We make them understand that lip service will not\n     do: if one is to make himself honest he must eat honesty\n     with breakfast, sweat with it in the sun, laugh and play and\n     suffer with it and lie down with it at night until it's near\n     as the oxygen in his blood. Yes, we aim high. Cruelly high,\n     would you say? We don't think so. Perfection is a cold spot\n     on top of a mountain, and nobody ever climbed there. We have\n     trouble and fun and arguments; sometimes the garden weeds\n     grow until tomorrow or the day after, but we sleep well.\n\n     DOROTHY: Speaking of perfection and goodness and things and\n     stuff--I know it was Paul who put those violin strings by\n     Nan's bed, but which one of you supplied them?\n\n     SLADE: Well, he told me--\n\n     DOROTHY: Will it be all right if I reach over this daughter\n     of mine and kiss you?\n\n     SLADE: They did brief us, back on Earth, that we must\n     respect local customs--\n\n     MIJOK: And perhaps even another drink could do him no harm.\n\n     PAKRIAA: He's pied.\n\n     ELIS: I would not say that. Speaking as Governor, I say that\n     the local wine industry deserves every encouragement it can\n     get--and has, ever since Samis' favorite kink had kittens in\n     the bottom of the vest bat.\n\n     SAMIS: Correction.\n\n     MIJOK: Best vat. Speaking as Lieutenant Governor. Just\n     elected--did it myself.\n\n     MUSON: The toastmistress has been quiet lately.\n\n     NISANA: Who, me?\n\n     PAUL: By acclamation, yes.\n\n     NISANA: Le'me think. We did drink to the children--those in\n     bed and those who ought to be--\n\n     HELEN: 'Ception.\n\n     DOROTHY: Great big woman. You weigh a ton, sweet stuff, 'n'\n     so do your eyelids, they do.\n\n     NISANA: And we drank to the olifants. No no--I am too\n     happy--my mind is a lake without a breeze. You propose the\n     toast, Pakriaa.\n\n     SALLY: Matter of fact I'm already sort of whooliollicky--I\n     think--\n\n     DOROTHY: Hey--maybe it's not just the wine. Paul--Doc--it\n     must be almost thirteen hours--\n\n     PAUL: Yes--yes, almost. Maybe you'd better--\n\n     SALLY: No, let's have one more toast. At least one more,\n     Pakriaa?\n\n     WRIGHT: I'll drink with you, Pakriaa.\n\n     PAKRIAA: Oh--let us be happy. Friends, I give you the wine\n     itself and the earth that made it. I give you birth and\n     death and the journey of our days and nights between them,\n     the shining of green fields, the patience of the forest, the\n     little stars, the great stars, the love and the thought, the\n     labor and the laughter, the good morning sky.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of West Of The Sun, by Edgar Pangborn\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK WEST OF THE SUN ***\n\n***** This file should be named 39572-8.txt or 39572-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/9/5/7/39572/\n\nProduced by Sankar Viswanathan, Bruce Albrecht, and the\nOnline Distributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
