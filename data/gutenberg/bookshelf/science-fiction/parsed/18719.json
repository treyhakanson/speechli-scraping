A different\nsort entirely at different places on the great, round, rolling Earth,\nbut nothing out of the ordinary. It was Tuesday on one side of the Date\nLine and Monday on the other. It was so-and-so's wedding anniversary and\nso-and-so's birthday and another so-and-so would get out of jail today.\nIt was warm, it was cool, it was fair, it was cloudy. One looked forward\nto the future with confidence, with hope, with uneasiness or with terror\naccording to one's temperament and one's geographical location and past\nhistory. To most of the human race this was nothing whatever but just\nanother day.\n\nBut to Joe Kenmore it was a most particular day indeed. Here, it was the\ngray hour just before sunrise and already there were hints of reddish\ncolorings in the sky. It was chilly, and somehow the world seemed still\nand breathless. To Joe, the feeling of tensity marked this morning off\nfrom all the other mornings of his experience.\n\nHe got up and began to dress, in Major Holt's quarters back of that\ngiant steel half-globe called the Shed, near the town of Bootstrap. He\nfelt queer because he felt so much as usual. By all the rules, he should\nhave experienced a splendid, noble resolution and a fiery exaltation,\nand perhaps even an admirable sensation of humility and unworthiness to\naccomplish what was expected of him today. And, deep enough inside, he\nfelt suitable emotion. But it happened that he couldn't take time to\nfeel things adequately today.\n\nHe was much more aware that he wanted some coffee rather badly, and that\nhe hoped everything would go all right. He looked out of the windows at\nempty, dreary desert under the dawn sky. Today was the day he'd be\nleaving on a rather important journey. He hoped that Haney and the\nChief and Mike weren't nervous. He also hoped that nobody had gotten at\nthe fuel for the pushpots, and that the slide-rule crew that had\ncalculated everything hadn't made any mistakes. He was also bothered\nabout the steering-rocket fuel, and he was uncomfortable about the\nbusiness of releasing the spaceship from the launching cage. There was,\ntoo, cause for worry in the take-off rockets--if the tube linings had\nshrunk there would be some rather gruesome consequences--and there could\nalways be last-minute orders from Washington to delay or even cancel\neverything.\n\nIn short, his mind was full of strictly practical details. He didn't\nhave time to feel noble aspirations or sensations of high destiny. He\nhad a very tricky and exacting job ahead of him.\n\nThe sky was growing lighter outside. Stars faded in a paling blue and\nthe desert showed faint colorings. He tied his necktie. A deep-toned\nkeening set up off to the southward, over the sere and dreary landscape.\nIt was a faraway noise, something like the lament of a mountain-sized\ncalf bleating for its mother. Joe took a deep breath. He looked, but saw\nnothing. The noise, though, told him that there'd been no cancellation\nof orders so far. He mentally uncrossed one pair of fingers. He couldn't\npossibly cross fingers against all foreseeable disasters. There weren't\nenough fingers--or toes either. But it was good that so far the schedule\nheld.\n\nHe went downstairs. Major Holt was pacing up and down the living room of\nhis quarters. Electric lights burned, but already the windows were\nbrightening. Joe straightened up and tried to look casual. Strictly\nspeaking, Major Holt was a family friend who happened also to be\nsecurity officer here, in charge of protecting what went on in the giant\nconstruction Shed. He'd had a sufficiently difficult time of it in the\npast, and the difficulties might keep on in the future. He was also the\nranking officer here and consequently the immediate boss of Joe's\nenterprise. Today's affair was still highly precarious. The whole thing\nwas controversial and uncertain and might spoil the career of somebody\nwith stars on his collar if it should fail. So nobody in the high brass\nwanted the responsibility. If everything went well, somebody suitable\nwould take the credit and the bows. Meanwhile Major Holt was boss by\ndefault.\n\nHe looked sharply at Joe. \"Morning.\"\n\n\"Good morning, sir,\" said Joe. Major Holt's daughter Sally had a sort of\nunderstanding with Joe, but the major hadn't the knack of cordiality,\nand nobody felt too much at ease with him. Besides, Joe was wearing a\nuniform for the first time this morning. There were only eight such\nuniforms in the world, so far. It was black whipcord, with an Eisenhower\njacket, narrow silver braid on the collar and cuffs, and a silver rocket\nfor a badge where a plane pilot wears his wings. It was strictly\npractical. Against accidental catchings in machinery, the trousers were\nnarrow and tucked into ten-inch soft leather boots, and the wide leather\nbelt had flat loops for the attachment of special equipment. Its width\nwas a brace against the strains of acceleration. Sally had had much to\ndo with its design.\n\nBut it hadn't yet been decided by the Pentagon whether the Space\nExploration Project would be taken over by the Army or the Navy or the\nAir Corps, so Joe wore no insignia of rank. Technically he was still a\ncivilian.\n\nThe deep-toned noise to the south had become a howl, sweeping closer and\ntrailed by other howlings.\n\n\"The pushpots are on the way over, as you can hear,\" said the major\ndetachedly, in the curious light of daybreak and electric bulbs\ntogether. \"Your crew is up and about. So far there seems to be no hitch.\nYou're feeling all right for the attempt today?\"\n\n\"If you want the truth, sir, I'd feel better with about ten years'\npractical experience behind me. But my gang and myself--we've had all\nthe training we can get without an actual take-off. We're the\nbest-trained crew to try it. I think we'll manage.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said the major. \"You'll do your best.\"\n\n\"We may have to do better than that,\" admitted Joe wrily.\n\n\"True enough. You may.\" The major paused. \"You're well aware that there\nare--ah--people who do not altogether like the idea of the United States\npossessing an artificial satellite of Earth.\"\n\n\"I ought to know it,\" admitted Joe.\n\nThe Earth's second, man-constructed moon--out in space for just six\nweeks now--didn't seem nowadays like the bitterly contested achievement\nit actually was. From Earth it was merely a tiny speck of light in the\nsky, identifiable for what it was only because it moved so swiftly and\nserenely from the sunset toward the east, or from night's darkness into\nthe dawn-light. But it had been fought bitterly before it was launched.\nIt was first proposed to the United Nations, but even discussion in the\nCouncil was vetoed. So the United States had built it alone. Yet the\nnations which objected to it as an international project liked it even\nless as a national one, and they'd done what they could to wreck it.\n\nThe building of the great steel hull now out there in emptiness had been\nfought more bitterly, by more ruthless and more highly trained\nsaboteurs, than any other enterprise in history. There'd been two\nattempts to blast it with atomic bombs. But it was high aloft, rolling\ngrandly around the Earth, so close to its primary that its period was\nlittle more than four hours; and it rose in the west and set in the east\nsix times a day.\n\nToday Joe would try to get a supply ship up to it, a very small\nrocket-driven cargo ship named Pelican One. The crew of the Platform\nneeded food and air and water--and especially the means of self-defense.\nToday's take-off would be the first attempt at a rocket-lift to space.\n\n\"The enemies of the Platform haven't given up,\" said the major\nformidably. \"And they used spectroscopes on the Platform's rocket fumes.\nApparently they've been able to duplicate our fuel.\"\n\nJoe nodded.\n\nMajor Holt went on: \"For more than a month Military Intelligence has\nbeen aware that rockets were under construction behind the Iron Curtain.\nThey will be guided missiles, and they will carry atom bomb heads. One\nor more may be finished any day. When they're finished, you can bet\nthat they'll be used against the Platform. And you will carry up the\nfirst arms for the Platform. Your ship carries half a dozen long-range\ninterceptor rockets to handle any attack from Earth. It's vitally\nimportant for them to be delivered.\"\n\n\"They'll attack the Platform?\" demanded Joe angrily. \"That's war!\"\n\n\"Not if they deny guilt,\" said the major ironically, \"and if we have\nnothing to gain by war. The Platform is intended to defend the peace of\nthe world. If it is destroyed, we won't defend the peace of the world by\ngoing to war over it. But while the Platform can defend itself, it is\nnot likely that anyone will dare to make war. So you have a very\nworthwhile mission. I suggest that you have breakfast and report to the\nShed. I'm on my way there now.\"\n\nJoe said, \"Yes, sir.\"\n\nThe major started for the door. Then he stopped. He hesitated, and said\nabruptly, \"If my security measures have failed, Joe, you'll be killed.\nIf there has been sabotage or carelessness, it will be my fault.\"\n\n\"I'm sure, sir, that everything anybody could do--\"\n\n\"Everything anybody can do to destroy you has been done,\" said the major\ngrimly. \"Not only sabotage, Joe, but blunders and mistakes and\nstupidities. That always happens. But--I've done my best. I suspect I'm\nasking your forgiveness if my best hasn't been good enough.\"\n\nThen, before Joe could reply, the major went hurriedly away.\n\nJoe frowned for a moment. It occurred to him that it must be pretty\ntough to be responsible for the things that other men's lives depend\non--when you can't share their danger. But just then the smell of coffee\nreached his nostrils. He trailed the scent. There was a coffeepot\nsteaming on the table in the dining-room. There was a note on a plate.\n\n     _Good luck. I'll see you in the Shed.\n\n     Sally_\n\nJoe was relieved. Sally Holt had been somewhere around underfoot all\nhis life. She was a swell girl, but he was grateful that he didn't have\nto talk to her just now.\n\nHe poured coffee and looked at his watch. He went to the window. The\nfaraway howling was much nearer, and dawn had definitely arrived. Small\ncloudlets in a pale blue sky were tinted pinkish by the rising sun.\nPatches of yucca and mesquite and sage out beyond the officers' quarters\narea stretched away to a far-off horizon. They were now visibly\ndifferent in color from the red-yellow earth between them, and cast\nlong, streaky shadows. The cause of the howling was still invisible.\n\nBut Joe cared nothing for that. He stared skyward, searching. And he saw\nwhat he looked for.\n\nThere was a small bright sliver of sunlight high aloft. It moved slowly\ntoward the east. It showed the unmistakable glint of sunshine upon\npolished steel. It was the artificial satellite--a huge steel\nhull--which had been built in the gigantic Shed from whose shadow Joe\nlooked upward. It was the size of an ocean liner, and six weeks since\nsome hundreds of pushpots, all straining at once, had gotten it out of\nthe Shed and panted toward the sky with it. They'd gotten it twelve\nmiles high and speeding eastward at the ultimate speed they could\nmanage. They'd fired jato rockets, all at once, and so pushed its speed\nup to the preposterous. Then they'd dropped away and the giant steel\nthing had fired its own rockets--which made mile-long flames--and swept\non out to emptiness. Before its rockets were consumed it was in an orbit\n4,000 miles above the Earth's surface, and it hurtled through space at\nsomething over 12,000 miles an hour. It circled the Earth in exactly\nfour hours, fourteen minutes, and twenty-two seconds. And it would\ncontinue its circling forever, needing no fuel and never descending. It\nwas a second moon for the planet Earth.\n\nBut it could be destroyed.\n\nJoe watched hungrily as it went on to meet the sun. Smoothly,\nunhurriedly, serenely, the remote and twinkling speck floated on out of\nsight. And then Joe went back to the table and ate his breakfast\nquickly. He wolfed it. He had an appointment to meet that minute speck\nsome 4,000 miles out in space. His appointment was for a very few hours\nhence.\n\nHe'd been training for just this morning's effort since before the\nPlatform's launching. There was a great box swinging in twenty-foot\ngimbal rings over in the Shed. There were motors and projectors and over\ntwo thousand vacuum tubes, relays and electronic units. It was a space\nflight simulator--a descendant of the Link trainer which once taught\nplane pilots how to fly. But this offered the problems and the\nsensations of rocketship control, and for many hours every day Joe and\nthe three members of his crew had labored in it. The simulator\nduplicated every sight and sound and feeling--all but heavy\nacceleration--to be experienced in the take-off of a rocketship to\nspace. The similitude of flight was utterly convincing. Sometimes it was\nappallingly so when emergencies and catastrophes and calamities were\nstaged in horrifying detail for them to learn to respond to. In six\nweeks they'd learned how to handle a spaceship so far as anybody could\nlearn on solid ground--if the simulator was correctly built. Nobody\ncould be sure about that. But it was the best training that could be\ndevised.\n\nIn minutes Joe had finished the coffee and was out of Major Holt's\nquarters and headed for the Shed's nearest entrance. The Shed was a\ngigantic metal structure rising out of sheer flat desert. There were\nhills to the westward, but only arid plain to the east and south and\nnorth. There was but one town in hundreds of miles and that was\nBootstrap, built to house the workmen who'd built the Platform and the\nstill invisible, ferociously howling pushpots and now the small supply\nships, the first of which was to make its first trip today.\n\nThe Shed seemed very near because of its monstrous size. When he was\nactually at the base of its wall, it seemed to fill half the firmament\nand more than half the horizon. He went in, and felt self-conscious when\nthe guard's eyes fell on his uniform. There was a tiny vestibule. Then\nhe was in the Shed itself, and it was enormous.\n\nThere were acres of wood-block flooring. There was a vast,\nsteel-girdered arching roof which was fifty stories high in the center.\nAll this size had been needed when the Space Platform was being built.\nMen on the far side were merely specks, and the rows of windows to\nadmit light usually did no more than make a gray twilight inside. But\nthere was light enough today. To the east the Shed's wall was split from\ntop to bottom. A colossal triangular gore had been loosened and thrust\nout and rolled aside, and a doorway a hundred and fifty feet wide let in\nthe sunshine. Through it, Joe could see the fiery red ball which was the\nsun just leaving the horizon.\n\nBut there was something more urgent for him to look at. Pelican One had\nbeen moved into its launching cage. Only Joe, perhaps, would really have\nrecognized it. Actually it was a streamlined hull of steel, eighty feet\nlong by twenty in diameter. There were stubby metal fins--useless in\nspace, and even on take-off, but essential for the planned method of\nlanding on its return. There were thick quartz ports in the bow-section.\nBut its form was completely concealed now by the attached, exterior\ntake-off rockets. It had been shifted into the huge cradle of steel\nbeams from which it was to be launched. Men swarmed about it and over\nit, in and out of the launching cage, checking and rechecking every\npossible thing that could make for the success of its flight to space.\n\nThe other three crew-members were ready--Haney and Chief Bender and Mike\nScandia. They were especially entitled to be the crew of this first\nsupply ship. When the Platform was being built, its pilot-gyros had been\nbuilt by a precision tool firm owned by Joe's father. He'd gone by plane\nwith the infinitely precise apparatus to Bootstrap, to deliver and\ninstall it in the Platform. And the plane was sabotaged, and the gyros\nwere ruined. They'd consumed four months in the building, and four\nmonths more for balancing with absolute no-tolerance accuracy. The\nPlatform couldn't wait so long for duplicates. So Joe had improvised a\nmethod of repair. And with Haney to devise special machine-tool setups\nand the Chief to use fanatically fine workmanship, and Mike and Joe\naiding according to their gifts, they'd rebuilt the apparatus in an\nimpossibly short time. The original notion was Joe's, but he couldn't\nhave done the job without the others.\n\nAnd there had been other, incidental triumphs by the team of four. They\nwere not the only ones who worked feverishly for the glory of having\nhelped to build the Earth's first artificial moon, but they had\naccomplished more than most. Joe had even been appointed to be an\nalternate member of the Platform's crew. But the man he was to have\nsubstituted for recovered from an illness, and Joe was left behind at\nthe Platform's launching. But all of them had rated some reward, and it\nwas to serve in the small ships that would supply the man-made\nsatellite.\n\nNow they were ready to begin. The Chief grinned exuberantly as Joe\nducked through the bars of the launching cage and approached the ship.\nHe was a Mohawk Indian--one of that tribe which for two generations had\nsupplied steel workers to every bridge and dam and skyscraper job on the\ncontinent. He was brown and bulky and explosive. Haney looked tense and\nstrained. He was tall and lean and spare, and a good man in any sort of\ntrouble. Mike blazed excitement. Mike was forty-one inches high and he\nwas full-grown. He had worked on the Platform, bucking rivets and making\nwelds and inspections in places too small for a normal-sized man to\nreach. He frantically resented any concessions to his size and he was as\ngood a man as any. He simply was the small, economy size.\n\n\"Hiya, Joe,\" boomed the Chief. \"All set? Had breakfast?\"\n\nJoe nodded. He began to ask anxious questions. About steering-rocket\nfuel and the launching cage release and the take-off rockets and the\nreduction valve from the air tanks--he'd thought of that on the way\nover--and the short wave and loran and radar. Haney nodded to some\nquestions. Mike said briskly, \"I checked\" to others.\n\nThe Chief grunted amiably, \"Look, Joe! We checked everything last night.\nWe checked it again this morning. I even caught Mike polishing the\nejection seats, because there wasn't anything else to make sure of!\"\n\nJoe managed a smile. The ejection seats were assuredly the most unlikely\nof all devices to be useful today. They were supposedly life-saving\ndevices. If the ship came a cropper on take-off, the four of them were\nsupposed to use ejection-seats like those supplied to jet pilots. They\nwould be thrown clear of the ship and ribbon-parachutes might open and\nmight let them land alive. But it wasn't likely. Joe had objected to\ntheir presence. If a feather dropped to Earth from a height of 600\nmiles, it would be falling so fast when it hit the atmosphere that it\nwould heat up and burn to ashes from pure air-friction. It wasn't likely\nthat they could get out of the ship if anything went wrong.\n\nSomebody marched stiffly toward the four of them. Joe's expression grew\nrueful. The Space Project was neither Army nor Navy nor Air Corps, but\nsomething that so far was its own individual self. But the man marching\ntoward Joe was Lieutenant Commander Brown, strictly Navy, assigned to\nthe Shed as an observer. And there were some times when he baffled Joe.\nLike now.\n\nHe halted, and looked as if he expected Joe to salute. Joe didn't.\n\nLieutenant Commander Brown said, formally: \"I would like to offer my\nbest wishes for your trip, Mr. Kenmore.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" said Joe.\n\nBrown smiled distantly. \"You understand, of course, that I consider\nnavigation essentially a naval function, and it does seem to me that any\nship, including a spaceship, should be manned by naval personnel. But I\nassuredly wish you good fortune.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" said Joe again.\n\nBrown shook hands, then stalked off.\n\nHaney rumbled in his throat. \"How come, Joe, he doesn't wish all of us\ngood luck?\"\n\n\"He does,\" said Joe. \"But his mind's in uniform too. He's been trained\nthat way. I'd like to make a bet that we have him as a passenger out to\nthe Platform some day.\"\n\n\"Heaven forbid!\" growled Haney.\n\nThere was an outrageous tumult outside the wide-open gap in the Shed's\nwall. Something went shrieking by the doorway. It looked like the\nmagnified top half of a loaf of baker's bread, painted gray and equipped\nwith an air-scoop in front and a plastic bubble for a pilot. It howled\nlike a lost baby dragon, its flat underside tilted up and up until it\nwas almost vertical. It had no wings, but a blue-white flame spurted\nout of its rear, wobbling from side to side for reasons best known to\nitself. It was a pushpot, which could not possibly be called a jet plane\nbecause it could not possibly fly. Only it did. It settled down on its\nflame-spouting tail, and the sparse vegetation burst into smoky flame\nand shriveled, and the thing--still shrieking like a fog-horn in a\ntunnel--flopped flat forward with a resounding _clank!_ It was abruptly\nsilent.\n\nBut the total noise was not lessened. Another pushpot came soaring\nwildly into view, making hysterical outcries. It touched and banged\nviolently to earth. Others appeared in the air beyond the construction\nShed. One flopped so hard on landing that its tail rose in the air and\nit attempted a somersault. It made ten times more noise than before--the\nflame from its tail making wild gyrations--and flopped back again with a\ncrash. Two others rolled over on their sides after touching ground. One\nended up on its back like a tumble-bug, wriggling.\n\nThey seemed to land by hundreds, but their number was actually in\ndozens. It was not until the last one was down that Joe could make\nhimself heard. The pushpots were jet motors in frames and metal skin,\nwith built-in jato rocket tubes besides their engines. On the ground\nthey were quite helpless. In the air they were unbelievably clumsy. They\nwere actually balanced and steered by vanes in the blasts of their jets,\nand they combined the absolute maximum of sheer thrust with the\nirreducible minimum of flyability.\n\nCrane-trucks went out to pick them up. Joe said anxiously, \"We'd better\ncheck our flight plan again. We have to know it absolutely!\"\n\nHe headed across the floor to the flight data board. He passed the hull\nof another ship like his own, which was near completion, and the bare\nskeletons of two others which needed a lot of work yet. They'd been\nbegun at distant plants and then hauled here on monstrous trailers for\ncompletion. The wooden mockup of the design for all the ships--in which\nevery possible arrangement of instruments and machinery had been tested\nout--lay neglected by the Shed wall.\n\nThe four stood before the flight data board. It listed the readings\nevery instrument should show during every instant of the flight. The\nreadings had been calculated with infinite care, and Joe and the others\nneeded to know them rather better than they knew their multiplication\ntables. Once they started out, they wouldn't have time to wonder if\neverything was right for the time and place. They needed to know.\n\nThey stood there, soaking up the information the board contained,\nforming mental pictures of it, making as sure as possible that any one\nof them would spot anything wrong the instant it showed up, and would\ninstantly know what had to be done about it.\n\nA gigantic crane-truck came in through the wide doorway. It dangled a\npushpot. It rolled over to the launching cage in which the spaceship lay\nand set the unwieldy metal object against that cage. There was a _clank_\nas the pushpot caught hold of the magnetic grapples. The crane went out\nagain, passing a second crane carrying a second pushpot. The second\nbeetle-like thing was presented to the cage. It stuck fast. The crane\nwent out for more.\n\nMajor Holt came across the floor of the Shed. It took him a long time to\nwalk the distance from the Security offices to the launching cage. When\nhe got there, he looked impatiently around. His daughter Sally came out\nof nowhere and blew her nose as if she'd been crying, and pointed to the\ndata board. The major shrugged his shoulders and looked uneasily at her.\nShe regarded him with some defiance. The major spoke to her sternly.\nThey waited.\n\nThe cranes brought in more pushpots and set them up against the steel\nlaunching cage. The ship had been nearly hidden before by the rocket\ntubes fastened outside its hull. It went completely out of sight behind\nthe metal monsters banked about it.\n\nThe major looked at his watch and the group about the data board. They\nmoved away from it and back toward the ship. Joe saw the major and\nswerved over to him.\n\n\"I have brought you,\" said the major in an official voice, \"the invoice\nof your cargo. You will deliver the invoice with the cargo and bring\nback proper receipts.\"\n\n\"I hope,\" said Joe.\n\n\"_We_ hope!\" said Sally in a strained tone. \"Good luck, Joe!\"\n\n\"Thanks.\"\n\n\"There is not much to say to you,\" said the major without visible\nemotion. \"Of course the next crew will start its training immediately,\nbut it may be a month before another ship can take off. It is extremely\ndesirable that you reach the Platform today.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Joe wrily. \"I have even a personal motive to get there.\nIf I don't, I break my neck.\"\n\nThe major ignored the comment. He shook hands formally and marched away.\nSally smiled up at Joe, but her eyes were suddenly full of tears.\n\n\"I--do hope everything goes all right, Joe,\" she said unsteadily.\n\"I--I'll be praying for you.\"\n\n\"I can use some of that, too,\" admitted Joe.\n\nShe looked at her hand. Joe's ring was on her finger--wrapped with\nstring on the inside of the band to make it fit. Then she looked up\nagain and was crying unashamedly.\n\n\"I--will,\" she repeated. Then she said fiercely, \"I don't care if\nsomebody's looking, Joe. It's time for you to go in the ship.\"\n\nHe kissed her, and turned and went quickly to the peculiar mass of\nclustered pushpots, touching and almost overlapping each other.\n\nHe ducked under and looked back. Sally waved. He waved back. Then he\nclimbed up the ladder into Pelican One's cabin. Somebody pulled the\nladder away and scuttled out of the cage.\n\nThe others were in their places. Joe slowly closed the door from the\ncabin to the outer world. There was suddenly a cushioned silence about\nhim. Out the quartz-glass ports he could see ahead, out the end of the\ncage through the monstrous doorway to the desert beyond. Overhead he\ncould see the dark, girder-lined roof of the Shed. On either side,\nthough, he could see only the scratched, dented, flat undersides of the\npushpots ready to lift the ship upward.\n\n\"You can start on the pushpot motors, Haney,\" he said curtly.\n\nJoe moved to his own, the pilot's seat. Haney pushed a button. Through\nthe fabric of the ship came the muted uproar of a pushpot engine\nstarting. Haney pushed another button. Another. Another. More jet\nengines bellowed. The tumult in the Shed would be past endurance, now.\n\nJoe strapped himself into his seat. He made sure that the Chief at the\nsteering-rocket manual controls was fastened properly, and Mike at the\nradio panel was firmly belted past the chance of injury.\n\nHaney said with enormous calm, \"All pushpot motors running, Joe.\"\n\n\"Steering rockets ready,\" the Chief reported.\n\n\"Radio operating,\" came from Mike. \"Communications room all set.\"\n\nJoe reached to the maneuver controls. He should have been sweating. His\nhands, perhaps, should have quivered with tension. But he was too much\nworried about too many things. Nobody can strike an attitude or go into\na blue funk while they are worrying about things to be done. Joe heard\nthe small gyro motors as their speed went up. A hum and a whine and then\na shrill whistle which went up in pitch until it wasn't anything at all.\nHe frowned anxiously and said to Haney, \"I'm taking over the pushpots.\"\n\nHaney nodded. Joe took the over-all control. The roar of engines outside\ngrew loud on the right-hand side, and died down. It grew thunderous to\nthe left, and dwindled. The ones ahead pushed. Then the ones behind. Joe\nnodded and wet his lips. He said: \"Here we go.\"\n\nThere was no more ceremony than that. The noise of the jet motors\noutside rose to a thunderous volume which came even through the little\nship's insulated hull. Then it grew louder, and louder still, and Joe\nstirred the controls by ever so tiny a movement.\n\nSuddenly the ship did not feel solid. It stirred a little. Joe held his\nbreath and cracked the over-all control of the pushpots' speed a tiny\ntrace further. The ship wobbled a little. Out the quartz-glass windows,\nthe great door seemed to descend. In reality the clustered pushpots and\nthe launching cage rose some thirty feet from the Shed floor and hovered\nthere uncertainly. Joe shifted the lever that governed the vanes in the\njet motor blasts. Ship and cage and pushpots, all together, wavered\ntoward the doorway. They passed out of it, rocking a little and pitching\na little and wallowing a little. As a flying device, the combination was\na howling tumult and a horror. It was an aviation designer's nightmare.\nIt was a bad dream by any standard.\n\nBut it wasn't meant as a way to fly from one place to another on Earth.\nIt was the first booster stage of a three-stage rocket aimed at outer\nspace. It looked rather like--well--if a swarm of bumblebees clung\nfiercely to a wire-gauze cage in which lay a silver minnow wrapped in\nmatch-sticks; and if the bees buzzed furiously and lifted it in a\nstraining, clumsy, and altogether unreasonable manner; and if the\nappearance and the noise together were multiplied a good many thousands\nof times--why--it would present a great similarity to the take-off of\nthe spaceship under Joe's command. Nothing like it could be graceful or\nneatly controllable or even very speedy in the thick atmosphere near the\nground. But higher, it would be another matter.\n\nIt _was_ another matter. Once clear of the Shed, and with flat, sere\ndesert ahead to the very horizon, Joe threw on full power to the pushpot\nmotors. The clumsy-seeming aggregation of grotesque objects began to\nclimb. Ungainly it was, and clumsy it was, but it went upward at a rate\na jet-fighter might have trouble matching. It wobbled, and it swung\naround and around, and it tipped crazily, the whole aggregation of jet\nmotors and cage and burden of spaceship as a unit. But it rose!\n\nThe ground dropped so swiftly that even the Shed seemed to shrivel like\na pricked balloon. The horizon retreated as if a carpet were hastily\nunrolled by magic. The barometric pressure needles turned.\n\n\"Communications says our rate-of-climb is 4,000 feet a minute and going\nup fast,\" Mike announced. \"It's five.... We're at 17,000 feet ...\n18,000. We should get some eastward velocity at 32,000 feet. Our height\nis now 21,000 feet....\"\n\nThere was no change in the feel of things inside the ship, of course.\nSealed against the vacuum of space, barometric pressure outside made no\ndifference. Height had no effect on the air inside the ship.\n\nAt 25,000 feet the Chief said suddenly: \"We're pointed due east, Joe.\nFreeze it?\"\n\n\"Right,\" said Joe. \"Freeze it.\"\n\nThe Chief threw a lever. The gyros were running at full operating speed.\nBy engaging them, the Chief had all their stored-up kinetic energy\navailable to resist any change of direction the pushpots might produce\nby minor variations in their thrusts. Haney brooded over the reports\nfrom the individual engines outside. He made minute adjustments to keep\nthem balanced. Mike uttered curt comments into the communicator from\ntime to time.\n\nAt 33,000 feet there was a momentary sensation as if the ship were\ntilted sharply. It wasn't. The instruments denied any change from level\nrise. The upward-soaring complex of flying things had simply risen into\na jet-stream, one of those wildly rushing wind-floods of the upper\natmosphere.\n\n\"Eastern velocity four hundred,\" said Mike from the communicator. \"Now\nfour-twenty-five.... Four-forty.\"\n\nThere was a 300-mile-an-hour wind behind them. A tail-wind, west to\neast. The pushpots struggled now to get the maximum possible forward\nthrust before they rose out of that east-bound hurricane. They added a\nfierce push to eastward to their upward thrust. Mike's cracked voice\nreported 500 miles an hour. Presently it was 600.\n\nAt 40,000 feet they were moving eastward at 680 miles an hour. A\njet-motor cannot be rated except indirectly, but there was over 200,000\nhorsepower at work to raise the spacecraft and build up the highest\npossible forward speed. It couldn't be kept up, of course. The pushpots\ncouldn't carry enough fuel.\n\nBut they reached 55,000 feet, which is where space begins for humankind.\nA man exposed to emptiness at that height will die just as quickly as\nanywhere between the stars. But it wasn't quite empty space for the\npushpots. There was still a very, very little air. The pushpots could\nstill thrust upward. Feebly, now, but they still thrust.\n\nMike said: \"Communications says get set to fire jatos, Joe.\"\n\n\"Right!\" he replied. \"Set yourselves.\"\n\nMike flung a switch, and a voice began to chatter behind Joe's head. It\nwas the voice from the communications-room atop the Shed, now far below\nand far behind. Mike settled himself in the tiny acceleration-chair\nbuilt for him. The Chief squirmed to comfort in his seat. Haney took his\nhands from the equalizing adjustments he had to make so that Joe's use\nof the controls would be exact, regardless of moment-to-moment\ndifferences in the thrust of the various jets.\n\n\"We've got a yaw right,\" said the Chief sharply. \"Hold it, Joe!\"\n\nJoe waited for small quivering needles to return to their proper\nregistrations.\n\n\"Back and steady,\" said the Chief a moment later. \"Okay!\"\n\nThe tinny voice behind Joe now spoke precisely. Mike had listened to it\nwhile the work of take-off could be divided, so that Joe would not be\ndistracted. Now Joe had to control everything at once.\n\nThe roar of the pushpots outside the ship had long since lost the volume\nand timbre of normal atmosphere. Not much sound could be transmitted by\nthe near-vacuum outside. But the jet motors did roar, and the sound\nwhich was not sound at such a height was transmitted by the metal cage\nas so much pure vibration. The walls and hull of the spaceship picked up\na crawling, quivering pulsation and turned it into sound. Standing waves\nset up and dissolved and moved erratically in the air of the cabin.\nJoe's eardrums were strangely affected. Now one ear seemed muted by a\ntemporary difference of air pressure where a standing wave lingered for\na second or two. Then the other eardrum itched. There were creeping\nsensations as of things touching one and quickly moving away.\n\nJoe swung a microphone into place before his mouth.\n\n\"All set,\" he said evenly. \"Brief me.\"\n\nThe tinny voice said:\n\n\"_You are at 65,000 feet. Your curve of rate-of-climb is flattening out.\nYou are now rising at near-maximum speed, and not much more forward\nvelocity can be anticipated. You have an air-speed relative to surface\nof six-nine-two miles per hour. The rotational speed of Earth at this\nlatitude is seven-seven-eight. You have, then, a total orbital speed of\none-four-seven-oh miles per hour, or nearly twelve per cent of your\nneeded final velocity. Since you will take off laterally and practically\nwithout air resistance, a margin of safety remains. You are authorized\nto blast._\"\n\nJoe said:\n\n\"Ten seconds. Nine ... eight ... seven ... six ... five ... four ...\nthree ... two ... one....\"\n\nHe stabbed the master jato switch. And a monstrous jato rocket, built\ninto each and every one of the pushpots outside, flared chemical fumes\nin a simultaneous, gigantic thrust. A small wire-wound jato for\njet-assisted-take-off will weigh a hundred and forty pounds and deliver\na thousand pounds of thrust for fourteen seconds. And that is for\nrockets using nonpoisonous compounds. The jatos of the pushpots used the\nberyllium-fluorine fuel that had lifted the Platform and that filled the\ntake-off rockets of Joe's ship. These jatos gave the pushpots themselves\nan acceleration of ten gravities, but it had to be shared with the cage\nand the ship. Still....\n\nJoe felt himself slammed back into his seat with irresistible,\noverwhelming force. The vibration from the jets had been bad. Now he\ndidn't notice it. He didn't notice much of anything but the horrible\nsensations of six-gravity acceleration.\n\nIt was not exactly pain. It was a feeling as if a completely intolerable\nand unbearable pressure pushed at him. Not only on the outside, like a\nblow, but inside too, like nothing else imaginable. Not only his chest\npressed upon his lungs, but his lungs strained toward his backbone. Not\nonly the flesh of his thighs tugged to flatten itself against his\nacceleration-chair, but the blood in his legs tried to flow into and\nburst the blood-vessels in the back of his legs.\n\nThe six-gravity acceleration seemed to endure for centuries. Actually,\nit lasted for fourteen seconds. In that time it increased the speed of\nthe little ship by rather more than half a mile per second, something\nover 1,800 miles per hour. Before, the ship had possessed an orbital\nspeed of a shade over 1,470 miles an hour. After the jato thrust, it was\ntraveling nearly 3,400 miles per hour. It needed to travel something\nover 12,000 miles per hour to reach the artificial satellite of Earth.\n\nThe intolerable thrust ended abruptly. Joe gasped. But he could allow\nhimself only a shake of the head to clear his brain. He jammed down the\ntake-off rocket firing button. There was a monstrous noise and a mighty\nsurging, and Haney panted, \"Clear of cage....\"\n\nAnd then they were pressed fiercely against their acceleration chairs\nagain. The ship was no longer in its launching cage. It was no longer\nupheld by pushpots. It was free, with its take-off rockets flaming. It\nplunged on up and out. But the acceleration was less. Nobody can stand\nsix gravities for long. Anybody can take three--for a while.\n\nJoe's body resisted movement with a weight of four hundred and fifty\npounds, instead of a third as much for normal. His heart had to pump\nagainst three times the normal resistance of gravity. His chest felt as\nif it had a leaden weight on it. His tongue tried to crowd the back of\nhis mouth and strangle him. The sensation was that of a nightmare of\nimpossible duration. It was possible to move and possible to see. One\ncould breathe, with difficulty, and with titanic effort one could speak.\nBut there was the same feeling of stifling resistance to every movement\nthat comes in nightmares.\n\nBut Joe managed to keep his eyes focused. The dials of the instruments\nsaid that everything was right. The tinny voice behind his head, its\ntimbre changed by the weighting of its diaphragm, said: \"_All readings\ncheck within accuracy of instruments. Good work!_\"\n\nJoe moved his eyes to a quartz window. The sky was black. But there were\nstars. Bright stars against a black background. At the same instant he\nsaw the bright white disks of sunshine that came in the cabin portholes.\nStars and sunshine together. And the sunshine was the sunshine of\nspace. Even with the polarizers cutting off some of the glare it was\nunbearably bright and hot beyond conception. He smelled overheated\npaint, where the sunlight smote on a metal bulkhead. Stars and super-hot\nsunshine together....\n\nIt was necessary to pant for breath, and his heart pounded horribly and\nhis eyes tried to go out of focus, but Joe Kenmore strained in his\nacceleration-chair and managed to laugh a little.\n\n\"We did it!\" he panted. \"In case you didn't notice, we're out of--the\natmosphere and--out in space! We're--headed to join the Space Platform!\"\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nThe pressure of three gravities continued. Joe's chest muscles ached\nwith the exertion of breathing over so long a period. Six gravities for\nfourteen seconds had been a ghastly ordeal. Three gravities for minutes\nbuilt up to something nearly as bad. Joe's heart began to feel fatigue,\nand a man's heart normally simply doesn't ever feel tired. It became\nmore and more difficult to see clearly.\n\nBut he had work to do. Important work. The take-off rockets were\nsolid-fuel jobs, like those which launched the Platform. They were\nwire-wound steel tubes lined with a very special refractory, with\nunstable beryllium and fluorine compounds in them. The solid fuel burned\nat so many inches per second. The refractory crumbled away and was\nhurled astern at a corresponding rate--save for one small point. The\nrefractory was not all exactly alike. Some parts of it crumbled away\nfaster, leaving a pattern of baffles which acted like a maxim silencer\non a rifle, or like an automobile muffler. The baffles set up eddies in\nthe gas stream and produced exactly the effect of a rocket motor's\nthroat. But the baffles themselves crumbled and were flung astern, so\nthat the solid-fuel rockets had always the efficiency of gas-throated\nrocket motors; and yet every bit of refractory was reaction-mass to be\nhurled astern, and even the steel tubes melted and were hurled away with\na gain in acceleration to the ship. Every fraction of every ounce of\nrocket mass was used for drive. No tanks or pumps or burners rode\ndeadhead after they ceased to be useful.\n\nBut solid-fuel rockets simply can't be made to burn with absolute\nevenness as a team. Minute differences in burning-rates do tend to\ncancel out. But now and again they reinforce each other and if\nuncorrected will throw a ship off course. Gyros can't handle such\neffects. So Joe had to watch his instruments and listen to the tinny\nvoice behind him and steer the ship against accidental wobblings as the\nEarth fell away behind him.\n\nHe battled against the fatigue of continuing to live, and struggled with\ngyros and steering jets to keep the ship on its hair-line course. He\npanted heavily. The beating of his heart became such a heavy pounding\nthat it seemed that his whole body shook with it. He had to do\ninfinitely fine precision steering with hands that weighed pounds and\narms that weighed scores of pounds and a body that had an effective\nweight of almost a quarter of a ton.\n\nAnd this went on and went on and on for what seemed several centuries.\n\nThen the voice in the speaker said thickly: \"_Everything is in the\nclear. In ten seconds you can release your rockets. Shall I count?_\"\n\nJoe panted, \"Count!\"\n\nThe mechanical voice said, \"_Seven ... six ... five ... four ... three\n... two ... one ... cut!_\"\n\nJoe pressed the release. The small, unburnt stubs of the take-off\nrockets went hurtling off toward emptiness. They consumed themselves as\nthey went, and they attained an acceleration of fifty gravities once\nthey were relieved of all load but their own substance. They had to be\nreleased lest one burn longer than another. It was also the only way to\nstop acceleration by solid-fuel rockets. They couldn't be extinguished.\nThey had to be released.\n\nFrom intolerably burdensome heaviness, there was abruptly no weight at\nall in the ship. Joe's laboring heart beat twice with the violence the\nweight had called for, though weight had ended. It seemed to him that\nhis skull would crack open during those two heart-beats. Then he lay\nlimply, resting.\n\nThere was a completely incredible stillness, for a time. The four of\nthem panted. Haney was better off than Joe, but the Chief was harder\nhit. Mike's small body had taken the strain best of all, and he would\nuse the fact later in shrill argument that midgets were designed by\nnature to be the explorers of space for their bulkier and less\nspaceworthy kindred.\n\nThe ending of the steady, punishing drag was infinitely good, but the\nnew sensation was hardly pleasant. They had no weight. It felt as if\nthey and the ship about them were falling together down an abyss which\nmust have a bottom. Actually, they were falling up. But they felt a\nphysical, crawling apprehension--a cringing from an imaginary imminent\nimpact.\n\nThey had expected the sensation, but it was not the better for being\nunderstood. Joe flexed and unflexed his fingers slowly. He stirred and\nswallowed hastily. But the feeling persisted. He unstrapped himself from\nhis seat. He stood up--and floated to the ceiling of the cabin. But\nthere was of course no ceiling. Every way was up and every way was down.\nHis stomach cramped itself in a hard knot, in the instinctive tensity of\nsomebody in free fall.\n\nHe fended himself from the ceiling and caught at a hand-line placed\nthere for just this necessity to grip something. In his absorption, he\ndid not notice which way his heels went. He suddenly noticed that his\ncompanions, with regard to him, were upside down and staring at him with\nwooden, dazed expressions on their faces.\n\nHe tried to laugh, and gulped instead. He pulled over to the\nquartz-glass ports. He did not put his hand into the sunlight, but\nshifted the glare shutters over those ports which admitted direct\nsunshine. Some ports remained clear. Through one of them he saw the\nEarth seemingly at arm's length somewhere off. Not up, not down. Simply\nout from where he was. It filled all the space that the porthole\nshowed. It was a gigantic mass of white, fleecy specks and spots which\nwould be clouds, and between the whiteness there was a muddy dark\ngreenish color which would be the ocean. Yet it seemed to slide very,\nvery slowly past the window.\n\nHe saw a tanness between the clouds, and it moved inward from the edge\nof his field of view. He suddenly realized what it was.\n\n\"We've just about crossed the Atlantic,\" he said in a peculiar\nastonishment. But it was true the ship had not been aloft nearly as much\nas half an hour. \"Africa's just coming into sight below. We ought to be\nabout 1,200 miles high and still rising fast. That was the calculation.\"\n\nHe looked again, and then drew himself across to the opposite porthole.\nHe saw the blackness of space, which was not blackness because it was a\ncarpet of jewels. They were infinite in number and variations in\nbrightness, and somehow of vastly more colorings than one noticed from\nEarth.\n\nHe heard the Chief grunt, and Haney gulp. He was suddenly conscious that\nhis legs were floating rather ridiculously in mid-air with no particular\nrelationship to anything. He saw the Chief rise very cautiously, holding\non to the arms of his seat.\n\n\"Better not look at the sun,\" said Joe, \"even though I've put on the\nglare-shields.\"\n\nThe Chief nodded. The glare-shields would keep out most of the heat and\na very great deal of the ultraviolet the sun gave off. But even so, to\nlook at the sun directly might easily result in a retinal sunburn which\ncould result in blindness.\n\nThe loudspeaker behind Joe's chair clattered. It had seemed muted by the\nweight of its diaphragm at three gravities. Now it blasted\nunintelligibly, with no weight at all. Mike threw a switch and took the\nmessage.\n\n\"Communications says radar says we're right on course, Joe,\" he reported\nnonchalantly, \"and our speed's okay. We'll reach maximum altitude in an\nhour and thirty-six minutes. We ought to be within calculated distance\nof the Platform then.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Joe abstractedly.\n\nHe strained his eyes at the Earth. They were moving at an extraordinary\nspeed and height. It had been reached by just four human beings before\nthem. The tannishness which was the coast of Africa crept with\nastonishing slowness toward the center of what he could see.\n\nJoe headed back to his seat. He could not walk, of course. He floated.\nHe launched himself with a fine air of confidence. He misjudged. He was\nfloating past his chair when he reached down--and that turned his\nbody--and fumbled wildly. He caught hold of the back as he went by, then\nheld on and found himself turning a grandly dignified somersault. He\nwound up in a remarkably foolish position with the back of his neck on\nthe back of the chair, his arms in a highly strained position to hold\nhim there, and his feet touching the deck of the cabin a good five feet\naway.\n\nHaney looked greenish, but he said hoarsely:\n\n\"Joe, don't make me laugh--not when my stomach feels like this!\"\n\nThe feeling of weightlessness was unexpectedly daunting. Joe turned\nhimself about very slowly, with his legs floating indecorously in\nentirely unintended kicks. He was breathing hard when he pulled himself\ninto the chair and strapped in once more.\n\n\"I'll take Communications,\" he told Mike as he settled his headphones.\n\nReluctantly, Mike switched over.\n\n\"Kenmore reporting to Communications,\" he said briefly. \"We have ended\nour take-off acceleration. You have our course and velocity. Our\ninstruments read--\"\n\nHe went over the bank of instruments before him, giving the indication\nof each. In a sense, this first trip of a ship out to the Platform had\nsome of the aspects of defusing a bomb. Calculations were useful, but\nobservations were necessary. He had to report every detail of the\ncondition of his ship and every instrument-reading because anything\nmight go wrong, and at any instant. Anything that went wrong could be\nfatal. So every bit of data and every intended action needed to be on\nrecord. Then, if something happened, the next ship to attempt this\njourney might avoid the same catastrophe.\n\nTime passed. A lot of time. The feeling of unending fall continued. They\nknew what it was, but they had to keep thinking of its cause to endure\nit. Joe found that if his mind concentrated fully on something else, it\njerked back to panic and the feel of falling. But the crew of the Space\nPlatform--now out in space for more weeks than Joe had been\nquarter-hours--reported that one got partly used to it, in time. When\nawake, at least. Asleep was another matter.\n\nThey were 1,600 miles high and still going out and up. The Earth as seen\nthrough the ports was still an utterly monstrous, bulging mass, specked\nwith clouds above vast mottlings which were its seas and land. They\nmight have looked for cities, but they would be mere patches in a\ntelescope. Their task now was to wait until their orbit curved into\naccordance with that of the Platform and they kept their rendezvous. The\nartificial satellite was swinging up behind them, and was only a\nquarter-circle about Earth behind them. Their speed in miles per second\nwas, at the moment, greater than that of the Platform. But they were\nclimbing. They slowed as they climbed. When their path intersected that\nof the Platform, the two velocities should be exactly equal.\n\nMajor Holt's voice came on the Communicator.\n\n\"_Joe_,\" he said harshly, \"_I have very bad news. A message came from\nCentral Intelligence within minutes of your take-off. I--ah--with Sally\nI had been following your progress. I did not decode the message until\nnow. But Central Intelligence has definite information that more than\nten days ago the--ah--enemies of our Space Exploration Project_--\" even\non a tight beam to the small spaceship, Major Holt did not name the\nnation everybody knew was most desperately resolved to smash space\nexploration by anybody but itself--\"_completed at least one rocket\ncapable of reaching the Platform's orbit with a pay-load that could be\nan atomic bomb. It is believed that more than one rocket was completed.\nAll were shipped to an unknown launching station._\"\n\n\"Not so good,\" said Joe.\n\nMike had left his post when Joe took over. Now he made a swooping dart\nthrough the air of the cabin. The midget showed no signs of the fumbling\nuncertainty the others had displayed--but he'd been a member of a midget\nacrobatic team before he went to work at the Shed. He brought himself to\na stop precisely at a hand-hold, grinning triumphantly at the nearly\nhelpless Chief and Haney.\n\nMajor Holt said in the headphones: \"_It's worse than that. Radar may\nhave told the country in question that you are on the way up. In that\ncase, if it's even faintly possible to blast the Platform before your\narrival with weapons for its defense, they'll blast._\"\n\n\"I don't like that idea,\" said Joe dourly. \"Anything we can do?\"\n\nMajor Holt laughed bitterly. \"_Hardly!_\" he said. \"_And do you realize\nthat if you can't unload your cargo you can't get back to Earth?_\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Joe. \"Naturally!\"\n\nIt was true. The purpose of the pushpots and the jatos and the ship's\nown take-off rockets had been to give it a speed at which it would\ninevitably rise to a height of 4,000 miles--the orbit of the Space\nPlatform--and stay there. It would need no power to remain 4,000 miles\nout from Earth. But it would take power to come down. The take-off\nrockets had been built to drive the ship with all its contents until it\nattained that needed orbital velocity. There were landing rockets\nfastened to the hull now to slow it so that it could land. But just as\nthe take-off rockets had been designed to lift a loaded ship, the\nlanding-rockets had been designed to land an empty one.\n\nThe more weight the ship carried, the more power it needed to get out to\nthe Platform. And the more power it needed to come down again.\n\nIf Joe and his companions couldn't get rid of their cargo--and they\ncould only unload in the ship-lock of the Platform--they'd stay out in\nemptiness.\n\nThe Major said bitterly: \"_This is all most irregular, but--here's\nSally._\"\n\nThen Sally's voice sounded in the headphones Joe wore. He was relieved\nthat Mike wasn't acting as communications officer at the moment to\noverhear. But Mike was zestfully spinning like a pin-wheel in the middle\nof the air of the control cabin. He was showing the others that even in\nthe intramural pastimes a spaceship crew will indulge in, a midget was\nbetter than a full-sized man. Joe said:\n\n\"Yes, Sally?\"\n\nShe said unsteadily. \"_I'm not going to waste your time talking to you,\nJoe. I think you've got to figure out something. I haven't the faintest\nidea what it is, but I think you can do it. Try, will you?_\"\n\n\"I'm afraid we're going to have to trust to luck,\" admitted Joe\nruefully. \"We weren't equipped for anything like this.\"\n\n\"_No!_\" said Sally fiercely. \"_If I were with you, you wouldn't think of\ntrusting to luck!_\"\n\n\"I wouldn't want to,\" admitted Joe. \"I'd feel responsible. But just the\nsame--\"\n\n\"_You're responsible now!_\" said Sally, as fiercely as before. \"_If the\nPlatform's smashed, the rockets that can reach it will be duplicated to\nsmash our cities in war! But if you can reach the Platform and arm it\nfor defense, there won't be any war! Half the world would be praying for\nyou, Joe, if it knew! I can't do anything else, so I'm going to start on\nthat right now. But you try, Joe! You hear me?_\"\n\n\"I'll try,\" said Joe humbly. \"Thanks, Sally.\"\n\nHe heard a sound like a sob, and the headphones were silent. Joe himself\nswallowed very carefully. It can be alarming to be the object of an\nintended murder, but it can also be very thrilling. One can play up\nsplendidly to a dramatic picture of doom. It is possible to be one's own\naudience and admire one's own fine disregard of danger. But when other\nlives depend on one, one has the irritating obligation not to strike\nposes but to do something practical.\n\nJoe said somberly: \"Mike, how long before we ought to contact the\nPlatform?\"\n\nMike reached out a small hand, caught a hand-hold, and flicked his eyes\nto the master chronometer.\n\n\"Forty minutes, fifty seconds. Why?\"\n\nJoe said wrily, \"There are some rockets in enemy hands which can reach\nthe Platform. They were shipped to launchers ten days ago. You figure\nwhat comes next.\"\n\nMike's wizened face became tense and angry. Haney growled, \"They smash\nthe Platform before we get to it.\"\n\n\"Uh-uh!\" said Mike instantly. \"They smash the Platform _when_ we get to\nit! They smash us both up together. Where'll we be at contact-time,\nJoe?\"\n\n\"Over the Indian Ocean, south of the Bay of Bengal, to be exact,\" said\nJoe. \"But we'll be moving fast. The worst of it is that it's going to\ntake time to get in the airlock and unload our guided missiles and get\nthem in the Platform's launching-tubes. I'd guess an hour. One bomb\nshould get both of us above the Bay of Bengal, but we won't be set to\nlaunch a guided missile in defense until we're nearly over America\nagain.\"\n\nThe Chief said sourly, \"Yeah. Sitting ducks all the way across the\nPacific!\"\n\n\"We'll check with the Platform,\" said Joe. \"See if you can get them\ndirect, Mike, will you?\"\n\nThen something occurred to him. Mike scrambled back to his communication\nboard. He began feverishly to work the computer which in turn would\nswing the tight-beam transmitter to the target the computer worked out,\nHe threw a switch and said sharply, \"Calling Space Platform! Pelican One\ncalling Space Platform! Come in, Space Platform!...\" He paused. \"Calling\nSpace Platform....\"\n\nJoe had a slide-rule going on another problem. He looked up, his\nexpression peculiar.\n\n\"A solid-fuel rocket can start off at ten gravities acceleration,\" he\nsaid quietly, \"and as its rockets burn away it can go up a lot higher\nthan that. But 4,000 miles is a long way to go straight up. If it isn't\nlaunched yet--\"\n\nMike snapped into a microphone: \"Right!\" To Joe he said, \"Space Platform\non the wire.\"\n\nJoe heard an acknowledgment in his headphones. \"I've just had word from\nthe Shed,\" he explained carefully, \"that there may be some guided\nmissiles coming up from Earth to smash us as we meet. You're still\nhigher than we are, and they ought to be starting. Can you pick up\nanything with your radar?\"\n\nThe voice from the Platform said: \"_We have picked something up. There\nare four rockets headed out from near the sunset-line in the Pacific.\nAssuming solid-fuel rockets like we used and you used, they are on a\ncollision course._\"\n\n\"Are you doing anything about them?\" asked Joe absurdly.\n\nThe voice said caustically: \"_Unfortunately, we've nothing to do\nanything with._\" It paused. \"_You, of course, can use the\nlanding-rockets you still possess. If you fire them immediately, you\nwill pass our scheduled meeting-place some hundreds of miles ahead of\nus. You will go on out to space. You may set up an orbit forty-five\nhundred or even five thousand miles out, and wait there for rescue._\"\n\nJoe said briefly: \"We've air for only four days. That's no good. It'll\nbe a month before the next ship can be finished and take off. There are\nfour rockets coming up, you say?\"\n\n\"_Yes._\" The voice changed. It spoke away from the microphone. \"_What's\nthat?_\" Then it returned to Joe. \"_The four rockets were sent up at the\nsame instant from four separate launching sites. Probably as many\nsubmarines at the corners of a hundred-mile square, so an accident to\none wouldn't set off the others. They'll undoubtedly converge as they\nget nearer to us._\"\n\n\"I think,\" said Joe, \"that we need some luck.\"\n\n\"_I think_,\" said the caustic voice, \"_that we've run out of it._\"\n\nThere was a click. Joe swallowed again. The three members of his crew\nwere looking at him.\n\n\"Somebody's fired rockets out from Earth,\" said Joe carefully. \"They'll\ncurve together where we meet the Platform, and get there just when we\ndo.\"\n\nThe Chief rumbled. Haney clamped his jaws together. Mike's expression\nbecame one of blazing hatred.\n\nJoe's mind went rather absurdly to the major's curious, almost\ndespairing talk in his quarters that morning, when he'd spoken of a\nconspiracy to destroy all the hopes of men. The firing of rockets at\nthe Platform was, of course, the work of men acting deliberately. But\nthey were--unconsciously--trying to destroy their own best hopes. For\nfreedom, certainly, whether or not they could imagine being free. But\nthe Platform and the space exploration project in general meant benefits\npast computing for everybody, in time. To send ships into space for\nnecessary but dangerous experiments with atomic energy was a purpose\nevery man should want to help forward. To bring peace on Earth was\nsurely an objective no man could willingly or sanely combat. And the\nultimate goal of space travel was millions of other planets, circling\nother suns, thrown open to colonization by humanity. That prospect\nshould surely fire every human being with enthusiasm. But something--and\nthe more one thought about it the more specific and deliberate it seemed\nto be--made it necessary to fight desperately against men in order to\nbenefit them.\n\nJoe swallowed again. It would have been comforting to be dramatic in\nthis war against stupidity and malice and blindness. Especially since\nthis particular battle seemed to be lost. One could send back an\neloquent, defiant message to Earth saying that the four of them did not\nregret their journey into space, though they were doomed to be killed by\nthe enemies of their country. It could have been a very pretty gesture.\nBut Joe happened to have a job to do. Pretty gestures were not a part of\nit. He had no idea how to do it. So he said rather sickishly:\n\n\"The Platform told me we could fire our landing-rockets as additional\ntake-off rockets and get out of the way. Of course we've got missiles of\nour own on board, but we can't launch or control them. Absolutely the\nonly thing we can choose to do or not do is fire those rockets. I'm open\nto suggestions if anybody can think of a way to make them useful.\"\n\nThere was silence. Joe's reasoning was good enough. When one can't do\nwhat he wants, one tries to make what he can do produce the results he\nwants. But it didn't look too promising here. They could fire the\nrockets now, or later, or--\n\nAn idea came out of the blue. It wasn't a good idea, but it was the only\none possible under the circumstances. There was just one distinctly\nremote possibility. He told the others what it was. Mike's eyes flamed.\nThe Chief nodded profoundly. Haney said with some skepticism, \"It's all\nwe've got. We've got to use it.\"\n\n\"I need some calculations. Spread. Best time of firing. That sort of\nthing. But I'm worried about calling back in the clear. A beam to the\nPlatform will bounce and might be picked up by the enemy.\"\n\nThe Chief grinned suddenly. \"I've got a trick for that, Joe. There's a\ntribesman of mine in the Shed. Get Charley Red Fox to the phone, guy,\nand we'll talk privately!\"\n\nThe small spaceship floated on upward. It pointed steadfastly in the\ndirection of its motion. The glaring sunshine which at its take-off had\nshone squarely in its bow-ports, now poured down slantingly from behind.\nThe steel plates of the ship gleamed brightly. Below it lay the sunlit\nEarth. Above and about it on every hand were a multitude of stars. Even\nthe moon was visible as the thinnest of crescents against the night of\nspace.\n\nThe ship climbed steeply. It was meeting the Platform after only half a\ncircuit of Earth, while the Platform had climbed upward for three full\nrevolutions. Earth was now 3,000 miles below and appeared as the most\ngigantic of possible solid objects. It curved away and away to mistiness\nat its horizons, and it moved visibly as the spaceship floated on.\n\nInvisible microwaves flung arrowlike through emptiness. They traveled\nfor thousands of miles, spreading as they traveled, and then struck the\nstrange shape of the Platform. They splashed from it. Some of them\nrebounded to Earth, where spies and agents of foreign powers tried\ndesperately to make sense of the incredible syllables. They failed.\n\nThere was a relay system in operation now, from spaceship to Platform to\nEarth and back again. In the ship Chief Bender, Mohawk and steelman\nextraordinary, talked to the Shed and to one Charley Red Fox. They\ntalked in Mohawk, which is an Algonquin Indian language, agglutinative,\ncomplicated, and not to be learned in ten easy lessons. It was not a\nlanguage which eavesdroppers were likely to know as a matter of course.\nBut it was a language by which computations could be asked for, so that\na very forlorn hope might be attempted with the best possible chances of\nsuccess.\n\nNaturally, none of this appeared in the look of things. The small ship\nfloated on and on. It reached an altitude of 3,500 miles. The Earth was\nvisibly farther away. Behind the ship the Atlantic with its stately\ncloud-formations was sunlit to the very edge of its being. Ahead, the\nedge of night appeared beyond India. And above, the Platform appeared as\na speck of molten light, quarter-illuminated by the sun above it.\n\nSpaceship and Platform moved on toward a meeting place. The ship moved a\ntrifle faster, because it was climbing. The speeds would match exactly\nwhen they met. The small torpedo-shaped shining ship and the bulging\nglowing metal satellite floated with a seeming vast deliberation in\nemptiness, while the most gigantic of possible round objects filled all\nthe firmament beneath them. They were 200 miles apart. It seemed that\nthe huge Platform overtook the shining ship. It did. They were only 50\nmiles apart and still closing in.\n\nBy that time the twilight band of Earth's surface was nearly at the\ncenter of the planet, and night filled more than a quarter of its disk.\n\nBy that time, too, even to the naked eye through the ports of the\nsupply-ship the enemy rockets had become visible. They were a thin skein\nof threads of white vapor which seemed to unravel in nothingness. The\nvapor curled and expanded preposterously. It could just be seen to be\njetting into existence from four separate points, two a little ahead of\nthe others. They came out from Earth at a rate which seemed remarkably\ndeliberate until one saw with what fury the rocket-fumes spat out to\nform the whitish threads. Then one could guess at a three-or even\nfour-stage launching series, so that what appeared to be mere pinpoints\nwould really be rockets carrying half-ton atomic warheads with an\nattained velocity of 10,000 miles per hour and more straight up.\n\nThe threads unraveled in a straight line aimed at the two metal things\nfloating in emptiness. One was small and streamlined, with inadequate\nlanding-rockets clamped to its body and with stubby fins that had no\npossible utility out of air. The other was large and clumsy to look at,\nbut very, very stately indeed in its progress through the heavens. They\nfloated smoothly toward a rendezvous. The rockets from Earth came\nravening to destroy them at the instant of their intersection.\n\nThe little spaceship turned slowly. Its rounded bow had pointed\nlongingly at the stars. Now it tilted downward. Its direction of\nmovement did not change, of course. In the absence of air, it could\ntumble indefinitely without any ill effect. It was in a trajectory\ninstead of on a course, though presently the trajectory would become an\norbit. But it pointed nose-down toward the Earth even as it continued to\nhurtle onward.\n\nThe great steel hull and the small spaceship were 20 miles apart. An\ninfinitesimal radar-bowl moved on the little ship. Tight-beam waves\nflickered invisibly between the two craft. The rockets raged toward\nthem.\n\nThe ship and the Platform were 10 miles apart. The rockets were now\nglinting missiles leaping ahead of the fumes that propelled them.\n\nThe ship and the Platform were two miles apart. The rockets rushed\nupward.... There were minute corrections in their courses. They\nconverged....\n\nFlames leaped from the tiny ship. Its landing-rockets spouted white-hot\nflame and fumes more thick and coiling than even the smoke of the bombs.\nThe little ship surged momentarily toward the racing monsters. And\nthen----\n\nThe rockets which were supposed to let the ship down to Earth flew\nfree--flung themselves unburdened at the rockets which came with deadly\nintent to the meeting of the two Earth spacecraft.\n\nThe landing-rockets plunged down at forty gravities or better. They were\na dwindling group of infinitely bright sparks which seemed to group\nthemselves more closely as they dwindled. They charged upon the\nattacking robot things. They were unguided, of necessity, but the robot\nbombs had to be equipped with proximity fuses. No remote control could\nbe so accurate as to determine the best moment for detonation at 4,000\nmiles' distance. So the war rockets had to be devised to explode when\nnear anything which reflected their probing radar waves. They had to be\ndesigned to be triggered by anything in space.\n\nAnd the loosed landing-rockets plunged among them.\n\nThey did not detonate all at once. That was mathematically impossible.\nBut no human eye could detect the delay. Four close-packed flares of\npure atomic fire sprang into being between the Platform and Earth. Each\nwas brighter than the sun. For the fraction of an instant there was no\nnight where night had fallen on the Earth. For thousands of miles the\nEarth glowed brightly.\n\nThen there was a twisting, coiling tumult of incandescent gases, which\nwere snatched away by nothingness and ceased to be.\n\nThen there were just two things remaining in the void. One was the\ngreat, clumsy, shining Platform, gigantic in size to anything close by.\nThe other was the small spaceship which had climbed to it and fought for\nit and defended it against the bombs from Earth.\n\nThe little ship now had a slight motion away from the Platform, due to\nthe instant's tugging by its rockets before they were released.\n\nIt turned about in emptiness. Its steering-rockets spouted smoke. It\nbegan to cancel out its velocity away from the Platform, and to swim\nslowly and very carefully toward it.\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nMaking actual contact with the platform was not a matter for instruments\nand calculations. It had to be done directly--by hand, as it were. Joe\nwatched out the ports and played the controls of the steering jets with\na nerve-racked precision. His task was not easy.\n\nBefore he could return to the point of rendezvous, the blinding sunlight\non the Platform took on a tinge of red. It was the twilight-zone of the\nsatellite's orbit, when for a time the sunlight that reached it was\nlight which had passed through Earth's atmosphere and been bent by it\nand colored crimson by the dust in Earth's air. It glowed a fiery red,\nand the color deepened, and then there was darkness.\n\nThey were in Earth's shadow. There were stars to be seen, but no sun.\nThe Moon was hidden, too. And the Earth was a monstrous, incredible,\nabysmal blackness which at this first experience of its appearance\nproduced an almost superstitious terror. Formerly it had seemed a\ndistant but sunlit world, flecked with white clouds and with sprawling\ndifferentiations of color beneath them.\n\nNow it did not look like a solid thing at all. It looked like a hole in\ncreation. One could see ten thousand million stars of every imaginable\ntint and shade. But where the Earth should be there seemed a vast\nnothingness. It looked like an opening to annihilation. It looked like\nthe veritable Pit of Darkness which is the greatest horror men have ever\nimagined, and since those in the ship were without weight it seemed that\nthey were falling into it.\n\nJoe knew better, of course. So did the others. But that was the look of\nthings, and that was the feeling. One did not feel in danger of death,\nbut of extinction--which, in cold fact, is very much worse.\n\nLights glowed on the outside of the Platform to guide the supply ship to\nit. There were red and green and blue and harsh blue-white electric\nbulbs. They were bright and distinct, but the feeling of loneliness\nabove that awful appearance of the Pit was appalling. No small child\nalone at night had ever so desolate a sensation of isolation as the four\nin the small ship.\n\nBut Joe painstakingly played the buttons of the steering-rocket control\nboard. The ship surged, and turned, and surged forward again. Mike, at\nthe communicator, said, \"They say slow up, Joe.\"\n\nJoe obeyed, but he was tense. Haney and the Chief were at other\nportholes, looking out. The Chief said heavily, \"Fellas, I'm going to\nadmit I never felt so lonesome in my life!\"\n\n\"I'm glad I've got you fellows with me!\" Haney admitted guiltily.\n\n\"The job's almost over,\" said Joe.\n\nThe ship's own hull, outside the ports, glowed suddenly in a light-beam\nfrom the Platform. The small, brief surges of acceleration which sent\nthe ship on produced tremendous emotional effects. When the Platform was\nonly one mile away, Haney switched on the ship's searchlights. They\nstabbed through emptiness with absolutely no sign of their existence\nuntil they touched the steel hull of the satellite.\n\nMike said sharply: \"Slow up some more, Joe.\"\n\nHe obeyed again. It would not be a good idea to ram the Platform after\nthey had come so far to reach it.\n\nThey drifted slowly, slowly, slowly toward it. The monstrous Pit of\nDarkness which was the night side of Earth seemed almost about to engulf\nthe Platform. They were a few hundred feet higher than the great metal\nglobe, and the blackness was behind it. They were a quarter of a mile\naway. The distance diminished.\n\nA thin straight line seemed to grow out toward them. There was a small,\nbulb-like object at its end. It reached out farther than was at all\nplausible. Nothing so slender should conceivably reach so far without\nbending of its own weight. But of course it had no weight here. It was a\nplastic flexible hose with air pressure in it. It groped for the\nspaceship.\n\nThe four in the ship held their breaths.\n\nThere was a loud, metallic _clank!_\n\nThen it was possible to feel the ship being pulled toward the Platform\nby the magnetic grapple. It was a landing-line. It was the means by\nwhich the ship would be docked in the giant lock which had been built to\nreceive it.\n\nAs they drew near, they saw the joints of the plating of the Platform.\nThey saw rivets. There was the huge, 30-foot doorway with its valves\nswung wide. Their searchlight beam glared into it. They saw the metal\nfloor, and the bulging plastic sidewalls, restrained by nets. They saw\nthe inner lock-door. It seemed that men should be visible to welcome\nthem. There were none.\n\nThe airlock swallowed them. They touched against something solid. There\nwere more clankings. They seemed to crunch against the metal\nfloor--magnetic flooring-grapples. Then, in solid contact with the\nsubstance of the Platform, they heard the sounds of the great outer\ndoors swinging shut. They were within the artificial satellite of Earth.\nIt was bright in the lock, and Joe stared out the cabin ports at the\nquilted sides. There was a hissing of air, and he saw a swirling mist,\nand then the bulges of the sidewall sagged. The air pressure gauge was\nspinning up toward normal sea-level air pressure.\n\nJoe threw the ready lever of the steering rockets to _Off_. \"We're\nlanded.\"\n\nThere was silence. Joe looked about him. The other three looked queer.\nIt would have seemed natural for them to rejoice on arriving at their\ndestination. But somehow they didn't feel that they had.\n\nJoe said wrily, \"It seems that we ought to weigh something, now we've\ngot here. So we feel queer that we don't. Shoes, Mike?\"\n\nMike peeled off the magnetic-soled slippers from their place on the\ncabin wall. He handed them out and opened the door. A biting chill came\nin it. Joe slipped on the shoe-soles with their elastic bands to hold\nthem. He stepped out the door.\n\nHe didn't land. He floated until he reached the sidewall. Then he pulled\nhimself down by the netting. Once he touched the floor, his shoes seemed\nto be sticky. The net and the plastic sidewalls were, of course, the\nmethod by which a really large airlock was made practical. When this\nship was about to take off again, pumps would not labor for hours to\npump the air out. The sidewalls would inflate and closely enclose the\nship's hull, and so force the air in the lock back into the ship. Then\nthe pumps would work on the air behind the inflated walls--with nets to\nhelp them draw the wall-stuff back to let the ship go free. The lock\ncould be used with only fifteen minutes for pumping instead of four\nhours.\n\nThe door in the back of the lock clanked open. Joe tried to walk toward\nit. He discovered his astounding clumsiness. To walk in magnetic-soled\nshoes in weightlessness requires a knack. When Joe lifted one foot and\ntried to swing the other forward, his body tried to pivot. When he\nlifted his right foot, he had to turn his left slightly inward. His arms\ntried to float absurdly upward. When he was in motion and essayed to\npause, his whole body tended to continue forward with a sedate toppling\nmotion that brought him down flat on his face. He had to put one foot\nforward to check himself. He seemed to have no sense of balance. When he\nstood still--his stomach queasy because of weightlessness--he found\nhimself tilting undignifiedly forward or back--or, with equal\nunpredictability, sidewise. He would have to learn an entirely new\nmethod of walking.\n\nA man came in the lock, and Joe knew who it was. Sanford, the senior\nscientist of the Platform's crew. Joe had seen him often enough on the\ntelevision screen in the Communications Room at the Shed. Now Sanford\nlooked nerve-racked, but his eyes were bright and his expression\nsardonic.\n\n\"My compliments,\" he said, his voice tight with irony, \"for a splendidly\nfutile job well done! You've got your cargo invoice?\"\n\nJoe nodded. Sanford held out his hand. Joe fumbled in his pocket and\nbrought out the yellow sheet.\n\n\"I'd like to introduce my crew,\" said Joe. \"This is Haney, and Chief\nBender, and Mike Scandia.\" He waved his hand, and his whole body wobbled\nunexpectedly.\n\n\"We'll know each other!\" said Sanford sardonically. \"Our first job is\nmore futility--to get the guided missiles you've brought us into the\nlaunching tubes. A lot of good they'll do!\"\n\nA huge plate in the roof of the lock--but it was not up or down or in\nany particular direction--withdrew itself. A man floated through the\nopening and landed on the ship's hull; another man followed him.\n\n\"Chief,\" said Joe, \"and Haney. Will you open the cargo doors?\"\n\nThe two swaying figures moved to obey, though with erratic clumsiness.\nSanford called sharply: \"Don't touch the hull without gloves! If it\nisn't nearly red-hot from the sunlight, it'll be below zero from\nshadow!\"\n\nJoe realized, then, the temperature effects the skin on his face\nnoticed. A part of the spaceship's hull gave off heat like that of a\npanel heating installation. Another part imparted a chill.\n\nSanford said unpleasantly, \"You want to report your heroism, eh? Come\nalong!\"\n\nHe clanked to the doorway by which he had entered. Joe followed, and\nMike after him.\n\nThey went out of the lock. Sanford suddenly peeled off his metal-soled\nslippers, put them in his pocket, and dived casually into a four-foot\nmetal tube. He drifted smoothly away along the lighted bore, not\ntouching the sidewalls. He moved in the manner of a dream, when one\nfloats with infinite ease and precision in any direction one chooses.\n\nJoe and Mike did not share his talent. Joe launched himself after\nSanford, and for perhaps 20 or 30 feet the lighted aluminum sidewall of\nthe tube sped past him. Then his shoulder rubbed, and he found himself\nskidding to an undignified stop, choking the bore. Mike thudded into\nhim.\n\n\"I haven't got the hang of this yet,\" said Joe apologetically.\n\nHe untangled himself and went on. Mike followed him, his expression that\nof pure bliss. He was a tiny man, was Mike, but he had the longings and\nthe ambitions of half a dozen ordinary-sized men in his small body. And\nhe had known frustration. He could prove by mathematics that space\nexploration could be carried on by midgets at a fraction of the cost and\nrisk of the same job done by normal-sized men. He was, of course, quite\nright. The cabins and air and food supplies for a spaceship's crew of\nmidgets would cost and weigh a fraction of similar equipment for\nsix-footers. But people simply weren't interested in sending midgets\nout into space.\n\nBut Mike had gotten here. He was in the Space Platform. There were\nfull-sized men who would joyfully have changed places with him,\nforty-one inch height and all. So Mike was blissful.\n\nThe tube ended and Joe bounced off the wall that faced its end. Sanford\nwas waiting. He grinned with more than a hint of spite.\n\n\"Here's our communications room,\" he said. \"Now you can talk down to\nEarth. It'll be relayed, now, but in half an hour you can reach the Shed\ndirect.\"\n\nHe floated inside. Joe followed cautiously. There was another crew\nmember on duty there. He sat before a group of radar screens, with thigh\ngrips across his legs to hold him in his chair. He turned his head and\nnodded cheerfully enough.\n\n\"Here!\" snapped Sanford.\n\nJoe clambered awkwardly to the seat the senior crew member pointed out.\nHe made his way to it by handholds on the walls. He fumbled into the\nchair and threw over the curved thigh grips that would hold him in\nplace.\n\nSuddenly he was oriented. He had seen this room before--before the\nPlatform was launched. True, the man at the radar screens was\nupside-down with reference to himself, and Sanford had hooked a knee\nnegligently around the arm of a firmly anchored chair with his body at\nright angles to Joe's own, but at least Joe knew where he was and what\nhe was to do.\n\n\"Go ahead and report,\" said Sanford sardonically. \"You might tell them\nthat you heroically destroyed the rockets that attacked us, and that\nyour crew behaved splendidly, and that you have landed in the Space\nPlatform and the situation is well in hand. It isn't, but it will make\nnice headlines.\"\n\nJoe said evenly, \"Our arrival's been reported?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Sanford, grinning. \"Obviously the radar down on\nEarth--shipboard ones on this hemisphere, of course--have reported that\nthe Platform still exists. But we haven't communicated since the bombs\nwent off. They probably think we had so many punctures that we lost all\nour air and are all wiped out. They'll be glad to hear from you that we\naren't.\"\n\nJoe threw a switch, frowning. This wasn't right. Sanford was the senior\nscientist on board and hence in command, because he was best-qualified\nto direct the scientific observations the Platform was making. But there\nwas something specifically wrong.\n\nThe communicator hummed. A faint voice sounded. It swelled to loudness.\n\"Calling Space Platform! _Calling Space Platform!_ CALLING SPACE\nPLATFORM!\" Joe turned down the volume. He said into the microphone:\n\n\"Space Platform calling Earth. Joe Kenmore reporting. We have made\ncontact with the Platform and completed our landing. Our cargo is now\nbeing unloaded. Our landing rockets had to be expended against\npresumably hostile bombs, and we are now unable to return to Earth. The\nship and the Platform, however, are unharmed. I am now waiting for\norders. Report ends.\"\n\nHe turned away from the microphone. Sanford said sharply, \"Go on! Tell\nthem what a hero you are!\"\n\n\"I'm going to help unload my ship,\" Joe said shortly. \"You report what\nyou please.\"\n\n\"Get back at that transmitter!\" shouted Sanford furiously. \"Tell 'em\nyou're a hero! Tell 'em you're wonderful! I'll tell 'em how useless it\nis!\"\n\nJoe saw the other man in the room, the man at the radar screens, shake\nhis head. He got up and fumbled his way along the wall to the door.\nSanford shouted after him angrily.\n\nJoe went out, found the four-foot tunnel, and floated not down but along\nit back to the unloading lock. Wordlessly, he set to work to get the\ncargo out of the cargo hold of the spaceship.\n\nHandling objects in weightlessness which on Earth would be heavy was an\nart in itself. Two men could move tons. It needed only one man to start\na massive crate in motion. However, one had either to lift or push an\nobject in the exact line it was to follow. To thrust hard for a short\ntime produced exactly the same effect as to push gently for a longer\nperiod. Anything floated tranquilly in the line along which it was\nmoved. The man who had to stop it, though, needed to use exactly as much\nenergy as the man who sent it floating. He needed to check the floating\nthing in exactly the same line. If one tried to stop a massive shipment\nfrom one side, he would topple into it and he and the crate together\nwould go floundering helplessly over each other.\n\nThe Chief had gone off to help maneuver two-ton guided missiles into\nlaunching tubes. One crew member remained with Haney, unloading things\nthat would have had to be handled with cranes on Earth. Joe found\nhimself needed most in the storage chamber. A crate floated from the\nship to the crewman. Standing head downward, he stopped its original\nmovement, braced himself, and sent it floating to Joe. He braced\nhimself, stopped its flight, and very slowly--to move fast with anything\nheavy in his hands would pull his feet from the floor--set it on a stack\nof similar objects which would presently be fastened in place.\n\nEverything had to be done in slow motion, or one would lose his footing.\nJoe worked painstakingly. He gradually began to understand the process.\nBut the muscles of his stomach ached because of their continuous,\ninstinctive cramp due to the sensation of unending fall.\n\nMike floated through the hatchway from the lock. He twisted about as he\nfloated, and his magnetized soles clanked to a deft contact with the\nwall. He said calmly: \"That guy Sanford has cracked up. He's potty. If\nthis were jail he'd be stir-crazy. He's yelling into the communicator\nnow that we'll all be dead in a matter of days, and the rocket missiles\nwe brought up won't help. He's nasty about it, too!\"\n\nHaney called from the cargo space of the ship in the lock: \"All empty\nhere! We're unloaded.\"\n\nThere were sounds as he closed the cargo doors. Haney, followed by the\nChief, came into view, floating as Mike had done. But he didn't land as\nskillfully. He touched the wall on his hands and knees and bounced away\nand tried helplessly to swim to a hand-hold. It would have been funny\nexcept that Joe was in no mood for humor.\n\nMike whipped off his belt and flipped the end of it to Haney. He caught\nit and was drawn gently to the wall. Haney's shoes clicked to a hold.\nThe Chief landed more expertly.\n\n\"We need wings here,\" he said ruefully. \"You reported, Joe?\"\n\nJoe nodded. He turned to Brent, the crew member who'd been unloading. He\nknew him too, from their two-way video conversations.\n\n\"Sanford does act oddly,\" he said uncomfortably. \"When he met me in the\nlock he said our coming was useless. He talked about the futility of\neverything while I reported. He sounds like he sneers at every possible\naction as useless.\"\n\n\"Most likely it is,\" Brent said mildly. \"Here, anyhow. It does look as\nif we're going to be knocked off. But Sanford's taking it badly. The\nrest of us have let him act as he pleased because it didn't seem to\nmatter. It probably doesn't, except that he's annoying.\"\n\nMike said truculently, \"We won't be knocked off! We've got rockets of\nour own up here now! We can fight back if there's another attack!\"\n\nBrent shrugged. His face was young enough, but deeply lined. He said as\nmildly as before: \"Your landing rockets set off four bombs on the way\nfrom Earth. You brought us six more rocket missiles. How many bombs can\nwe knock down with them?\"\n\nJoe blinked. It was a shock to realize the facts of life in an\nartificial satellite. If it could be reached by bombs from Earth, the\nbombs could be reached by guided missiles from the satellite. But it\nwould take one guided missile to knock down one bomb--with luck.\n\n\"I see,\" said Joe slowly. \"We can handle just six more bombs from\nEarth.\"\n\n\"Six in the next month,\" agreed Brent wrily. \"It'll be that long before\nwe get more. Somebody sent up four bombs today. Suppose they send eight\nnext time? Or simply one a day for a week?\"\n\nMike made an angry noise. \"The seventh bomb shot at us knocks us out!\nWe're sitting ducks here too!\"\n\nBrent nodded. He said mildly:\n\n\"Yes. The Platform can't be defended against an indefinite number of\nbombs from Earth. Of course the United States could go to war because\nwe've been shot at. But would that do us any good? We'd be shot down in\nthe war.\"\n\nJoe said distastefully, \"And Sanford's cracked up because he knows he's\ngoing to be killed?\"\n\nBrent said earnestly. \"Oh, no! He's a good scientist! But he's always\nhad a brilliant mind. Poor devil, he's never failed at anything in all\nhis life until now! Now he _has_ failed. He's going to be killed, and he\ncan't think of any way to stop it. His brains are the only things he's\never believed in, and now they're no good. He can't accept the idea that\nhe's stupid, so he has to believe that everything else is. It's a\nnecessity for him. Haven't you known people who had to think everybody\nelse was stupid to keep from knowing that they were themselves?\"\n\nJoe nodded. He waited.\n\n\"Sanford,\" said Brent earnestly, \"simply can't adjust to the discovery\nthat he's no better than anybody else. That's all. He was a nice guy,\nbut he's not used to frustration and he can't take it. Therefore he\nscorns everything that frustrates him--and everything else, by\nnecessity. He'll be scornful about getting killed when it happens. But\nwaiting for it is becoming intolerable to him.\"\n\nHe looked at his watch. He said apologetically, \"I'm the crew\npsychologist. That's why I speak so firmly. In five minutes we're due to\ncome out of the Earth's shadow into sunshine again. I'd suggest that you\ncome to watch. It's good to look at.\"\n\nHe did not wait for an answer. He led the way. And the others followed\nin a strange procession. Somehow, automatically, they fell into single\nfile, and they moved on their magnetic-soled slippers toward a passage\ntube in one wall. Their slipper soles clanked and clicked in an erratic\nrhythm. Brent walked with the mincing steps necessary for movement in\nweightlessness. The others imitated him. Their hands no longer hung\nnaturally by their sides, but tended to make extravagant gestures with\nthe slightest muscular impulse. They swayed extraordinarily as they\nwalked. Brent was a slender figure, and Joe was more thick-set, and\nHaney was taller, and lean. The burly Chief and the forty-one inch\nfigure of Mike the midget followed after them. They made a queer\nprocession indeed.\n\nMinutes later they were in a blister on the skin of the Platform. There\nwere quartz glass ports in the sidewall. Outside the glass were metal\nshutters. Brent served out dense goggles, almost black, and touched the\nbuttons that opened the steel port coverings.\n\nThey looked into space. The dimmer stars were extinguished by the\ngoggles they wore. The brighter ones seemed faint and widely spaced.\nBeneath their feet as they held to handrails lay the featureless\ndarkness of Earth. But before them and very far away there was a vast,\ndim arch of deepest red.\n\nIt was sunlight filtered through the thickest layers of Earth's air. It\nbarely outlined the curve of that gigantic globe. As they stared, it\ngrew brighter. The artificial satellite required little more than four\nhours for one revolution about its primary, the Earth. To those aboard\nit, the Earth would go through all its phases in no longer a time. They\nsaw now the thinnest possible crescent of the new Earth. But in\nminutes--almost in seconds--the deep red sunshine brightened to gold.\nThe hair-thin line of light widened to a narrow ribbon which described\nan eight-thousand-mile half-circle. It brightened markedly at the\nmiddle. It remained red at its ends, but in the very center it glowed\nwith splendid flame. Then a golden ball appeared, and swam up and\ndetached itself from the Earth, and the on-lookers saw the breath-taking\nspectacle of all of Earth's surface seemingly being born of the night.\n\nAs if new-created before their eyes, seas and lands unfolded in the\nsunlight. They watched flecks of cloud and the long shadows of\nmountains, and the strangely different colorings of its fields and\nforests.\n\nAs Brent had told them, it was good to watch.\n\nIt was half an hour later when they gathered in the kitchen of the\nPlatform. The man who had been loading launching tubes now briskly\nworked to prepare a meal on the extremely unusual cooking-devices of a\nhuman outpost in interplanetary space.\n\nThe food smelled good. But Joe noticed that he could smell growing\nthings. Green stuff. It was absurd--until he remembered that there was a\nhydroponic garden here. Plants grew in it under sunlamps which were\nturned on for a certain number of hours every day. The plants purified\nthe Platform's air, and of course provided some fresh and nourishing\nfood for the crew.\n\nThey ate. The food was served in plastic bowls, with elastic thread\ncovers through which they could see and choose the particular morsels\nthey fancied next. The threads stretched to let through the forks they\nate with. But Brent used a rather more practical pair of tongs in a\nbusinesslike manner.\n\nThey drank coffee from cups which looked very much like ordinary cups on\nEarth. Joe remembered suddenly that Sally Holt had had much to do with\nthe design of domestic science arrangements here. He regarded his cup\nwith interest. It stayed in its saucer because of magnets in both\nplastic articles. The saucer stayed on the table because the table was\nmagnetic, too. And the coffee did not float out to mid-air in a hot,\nround brownish ball, because there was a transparent cover over the cup.\nWhen one put his lips to the proper edge, a part of the cover yielded as\nthe cup was squeezed. The far side of the cup was flexible. One pressed,\nand the coffee came into one's lips without the spilling of a drop.\n\nAt that moment Joe really thought of Sally for the first time in a good\ntwo hours. She'd been anxious that living in the Platform should be as\nnormal and Earth-like as possible. The total absence of weight would be\nbad enough. She believed it needed to be countered, as a psychological\nfactor in staying sane, by the effect of normal-seeming chairs and\nnormal-tasting food, and not too exotic systems for eating.\n\nJoe asked Brent about it.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Brent mildly. \"It's likely we'd all have gone off the\ndeep end if there weren't some familiar things about. To have to drink\nfrom a cup that one squeezes is tolerable. But we'd have felt hysterical\nat times if we had to drink everything from the equivalent of baby\nbottles.\"\n\n\"Sally Holt,\" said Joe, \"is a friend of mine. She helped design this\nstuff.\"\n\n\"That girl has every ounce of brains that any woman can be trusted\nwith!\" Brent said warmly. \"She thought of things that would never have\noccurred to me! As a psychologist, I could see how good her ideas were\nwhen she brought them up, but as a male I'd never have dreamed of them.\"\nThen he grinned. \"She fell down on just one point. So did everybody\nelse. Nobody happened to think of a garbage-disposal system for the\nPlatform.\"\n\nIt came into Joe's mind that garbage-disposal was hardly a subject one\nwould expect to be discussing in interplanetary space. But the Platform\nwasn't the same thing as a spaceship. A ship could jettison refuse and\nleave it behind, or store it during a voyage and dump it at either end.\nBut the Space Platform would never land. It could roll on forever. And\nif it heaved out its refuse from airlocks--why--the stuff would still\nhave the Platform's orbital speed and would follow it tirelessly around\nthe Earth until the end of time.\n\n\"We dry and store it now,\" said Brent. \"If we were going to live, we'd\nfigure out some way to turn it to fertilizer for the hydroponic gardens.\nIt's hardly worth while as things are. Even then, though, the problem of\ntin cans could be hopeless.\"\n\nThe Chief wiped his mouth deliberately. He had helped load four\nguided-missile launching tubes, and he had been brought up to date on\nthe state of things in the Platform. He growled in a preliminary fashion\nand said, \"Joe.\"\n\nJoe looked at him.\n\n\"We brought up six two-ton guided missiles,\" said the Chief dourly.\n\"We'll have warning of other bombs coming up. We can send these missiles\nout to intercept 'em. Six of 'em. They can get close enough to set off\ntheir proximity fuses, anyhow. But what are we going to do, Joe, if\nsomebody flings seven bombs at us? We can manage six--maybe. But what'll\nwe do with the one that's left over?\"\n\n\"Have you any ideas?\" asked Joe.\n\nThe Chief shook his head. Brent said mildly. \"We've worked on that here\nin the Platform, I assure you. And as Sanford puts it quite soundly,\nabout the only thing we can really do is throw our empty tin cans at\nthem.\"\n\nJoe nodded. Then he tensed. Brent had meant it as a rather mirthless\njoke. But Joe was astonished at what his own brain made of it. He\nthought it over. Then he said, \"Why not? It ought to be a very good\ntrick.\"\n\nBrent stared at him incredulously. Haney looked solemnly at him. The\nChief regarded Joe thoughtfully out of the corner of his eye. Then Mike\nshouted gleefully. The Chief blinked, and a moment later grunted\nwrathful unintelligible syllables of Mohawk, and then tried to pound Joe\non the back and because of his want of weight went head over heels into\nthe air between the six walls of the kitchen.\n\nHaney said disgustedly, \"Joe, there are times when a guy wants to murder\nyou! Why didn't I think of that?\"\n\nBut Brent was looking at the four of them with a lively, helpless\ncuriosity. \"Will you guys let me in on this?\"\n\nThey told him. Joe began to explain it carefully, but the Chief broke in\nwith a barked and impatient description, and then Mike interrupted to\nsnap a correction. But by that time Brent's expression had changed with\nastonishing suddenness.\n\n\"I see! I see!\" he said excitedly. \"All right! Have you got space suits\nin your ship? We have them. So we'll go out and pelt the stars with\ngarbage. I think we'd better get at it right now, too. In under two\nhours we'll be a fine target for more bombs, and it would be good to\nstart ahead of time.\"\n\nMike made a gesture and went floating out of the kitchen, air-swimming\nto go get space suits from the ship. The grin on his small face\nthreatened to cut his throat. Joe asked, \"Sanford's in command. How'll\nhe like this idea?\"\n\nBrent hesitated. \"I'm afraid,\" he said regretfully, \"he won't like it.\nIf you solve a problem he gave up, it will tear his present adjustment\nto bits. He's gone psychotic. I think, though, that he'll allow it to be\ntried while he swears at us for fools. He's most likely to react that\nway if you suggest it.\"\n\n\"Then,\" agreed Joe, \"I suggest it. Chief----\"\n\nThe Chief raised a large brown hand.\n\n\"I got the program, Joe,\" he said. \"We'll all get set.\"\n\nAnd Joe went floating unhappily through passage-tubes to the control\nroom. He heard Sanford's voice, sardonic and mocking, as he reached the\ncommunications room door.\n\n\"What do you expect?\" Sanford was saying derisively. \"We're clay\npigeons. We're a perfect target. We've just so much ammunition now. You\nsay you may send us more in three weeks instead of a month. I admire\nyour persistence, but it's really no use! This is all a very stupid\nbusiness....\"\n\nHe felt Joe's presence. He turned, and then sharply struck the\ncommunicator switch with the heel of his hand. The image on the\ntelevision screen died. The voice cut off. He said blandly: \"Well?\"\n\n\"I want,\" said Joe, \"to take a garbage-disposal party out on the outside\nof the Platform. I came to ask for authority.\"\n\nSanford looked at him in mocking surprise.\n\n\"To be sure it seems as intelligent as anything else the human race has\never done,\" he observed. \"But why does it appeal to you as something you\nwant to do?\"\n\n\"I think,\" Joe told him, \"that we can make a defense against bombs from\nEarth with our empty tin cans.\"\n\nSanford raised his eyebrows.\n\n\"If you happen to have a four-leaf clover with you,\" he said in fine\nirony, \"I'm told they're good, too.\"\n\nHis eyes were bright and scornful. His manner was feverishly derisive.\nJoe would have done well to let it go at that. But he was nettled.\n\n\"We set off the last bombs,\" he said doggedly, \"by shooting our landing\nrockets at them. They didn't collide with the bombs. They simply\ntouched off the bombs' proximity fuses. If we surround the Platform with\na cluster of tin cans and such things, they may do as well. Things we\nthrow away won't drop to Earth. Ultimately, they'll actually circle us,\nlike satellites themselves. But if we can get enough of them between us\nand Earth, any bombs that come up will have their proximity fuses\ndetonated by the floating trash we throw out.\"\n\nSanford laughed.\n\n\"We might ask for aluminum-foil ribbon to come up in the next supply\nship,\" said Joe. \"We could have masses of that, or maybe metallic dust\nfloating around us.\"\n\n\"I much prefer used tin cans,\" said Sanford humorously. \"I'll take the\nwatch here and let everybody go out with you. By all means we must\ndefend ourselves. Forward with the garbage! Go ahead!\"\n\nHis eyes were almost hysterically scornful as he waited for Joe to\nleave. Joe did not like it at all, but there was nothing to do but get\nout.\n\nHe found the Chief with a net bag filled with emptied tin cans. Haney\nhad another. There were two more, carried by members of the Platform's\nfour-man crew. They were donning their space suits when Joe came upon\nthem. Mike was grotesque in the cut-down outfit built for him. Actually,\nthe only difference was in the size of the fabric suit and the length of\nthe arms and legs. He could carry a talkie outfit with its batteries,\nand the oxygen tank for breathing as well as anybody, since out here\nweight did not count at all. There were plastic ropes, resistant to\nextremes of temperature.\n\nJoe got into his own space suit. It was no such self-contained space\ncraft in itself as the fantastic story tellers dreamed of. It was not\nmuch more than an altitude suit, aluminized to withstand the blazing\nheat of sunshine in emptiness, and with extravagantly insulated soles to\nthe magnetic boots. In theory, there simply is no temperature in space.\nIn practice, a metal hull heats up in sunshine to very much more than\nany record-hot-day temperature on Earth. In shadow, too, a metal hull\nwill drop very close to minus 250 degrees Centigrade, which is something\nlike 400 degrees Fahrenheit below zero. But mainly the space boots were\ninsulated against the almost dull-red-heat temperatures of\nlong-continued sunshine.\n\nA crewman named Corey moved into an airlock with one of the bags of\nempty tin cans. Brent watched in a routine fashion through a glass in\nthe lock-door. The pumps began to exhaust the air from the airlock.\nCorey's space suit inflated visibly. Presently the pump stopped. Corey\nopened the outer door. He went out, paying plastic rope behind him. An\ninstant later he reappeared and removed the rope. He'd made his line\nfast outside. He closed the outer lock-door. Air surged into the lock\nand Haney crowded in. Again the pumping. Then Haney went out, and was\nanchored to the Platform not only by his magnetic boots but by a rope\nfastened to a hand-hold. Brent went out. Mike. Joe came next.\n\nThey stood on the hull of the Space Platform, waiting in the incredible\nharsh sunshine of emptiness. The bright steel plates of the hull swelled\nand curved away on every hand. There were myriads of stars and the vast\nround bulk of Earth seemed farther away to a man in a space suit than to\na man looking out a port. Where shadows cut across the Platform's\nirregular surface, there was utter blackness. Also there was horrible\nfrigidity. Elsewhere it was blindingly bright. The men were specks of\nhumanity standing on a shining metal hull, and all about them there was\nthe desolation of nothingness.\n\nBut Joe felt strangely proud. The seventh man came out of the lock-door.\nThey tied their plastic ropes together and spread out in a long line\nwhich went almost around the Platform. The man next to the lock was\nanchored to a steel hand-hold. The third man of the line also anchored\nhimself. The fifth. The seventh. They were a straggling line of figures\nwith impossibly elongated shadows, held together by ropes. They were\npeculiarly like a party of weirdly costumed mountaineers on a glacier of\ngleaming silver.\n\nBut no mountain climbers ever had a background of ten thousand million\nstars, peering up from below them as well as from overhead. Nor did any\never have a mottled greenish planet rolling by 4,000 miles beneath\nthem, nor a blazing sun glaring down at them from a sky such as this.\n\nIn particular, perhaps, no other explorers ever set out upon an\nexpedition whose purpose was to throw tin cans and dried refuse at all\nthe shining cosmos.\n\nThey set to work. The space suits were inevitably clumsy. It was not\neasy to throw hard with only magnetism to hold one to his feet. It was\nactually more practical to throw straight up with an underhand gesture.\nBut even that would send the tin cans an enormous distance, in time.\nThere was no air to slow them.\n\nThe tin cans twinkled as they left the Platform's steel expanse. They\nmoved away at a speed of possibly 20 to 30 miles an hour. They floated\noff in all possible directions. They would never reach Earth, of course.\nThey shared the Platform's orbital speed, and they would circle the\nEarth with it forever. But when they were thrown away, their orbits were\ndisplaced a little. Each can thrown downward just now, for example,\nwould always be between the Platform and the Earth on this side of its\norbit. But on the other side of Earth it would be above the Platform.\nThe Platform, in fact, became the center of a swarm, a cluster, a cloud\nof infinitesimal objects which would always accompany it and always be\nin motion with regard to it. Together, they should make up a screen no\nproximity fuse bomb could pierce without exploding.\n\nJoe heard clankings, transmitted to his body through his feet.\n\n\"What's that?\" he demanded sharply. \"It sounds like the airlock!\"\n\nVoices mingled in his ears. The other walkie-talkies allowed everybody\nto speak at once. Most of them did. Then Joe heard someone laugh. It was\nSanford's voice.\n\nSandford's aluminized, space-suited figure came clanking around the\ncurve of the small metal world. The antenna of his walkie-talkie\nglittered above his head. He seemed to swagger against the background of\nmany-colored stars.\n\nBrent spoke quickly, before anyone else could question Sanford. His\ntone was mild and matter of fact, but Joe somehow knew the tension\nbehind it.\n\n\"Hello, Sanford. You came out? Was it wise? Shouldn't there be someone\ninside the Platform?\"\n\nSanford laughed again. \"It was very wise. We're going to be killed, as\nyou fellows know perfectly well. It's futile to try to avoid it. So very\nsensibly I've decided to spare myself the nuisance of waiting to be\nkilled. I came out.\"\n\nThere was silence in the ear-phones of Joe's space suit radio. He heard\nhis own heart beating loudly and steadily in the absolute stillness.\n\n\"Incidentally,\" said Sanford with almost hysterical amusement, \"I fixed\nit so that none of us can get back in. It would be useless, anyhow.\nEverything's futility. So I've put an end to our troubles for good. I've\nlocked us all out.\"\n\nHe laughed yet again. And Joe knew that in Sanford's madness it was\nperfectly possible for him to have done exactly what he said.\n\nThere were eight human beings on the Platform. All were now outside it,\non its outer skin. They wore space suits with from half an hour to an\nhour's oxygen supply. They had no tools with which to break back into\nthe satellite. And no help could possibly reach them in less than three\nweeks.\n\nIf they couldn't get back inside the Platform, Sanford, laughing\nproudly, had killed them all.\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nThere was a babbling of angry, strained, tense voices in Joe's\nheadphones. Then the Chief roared for silence. It fell, save for\nSanford's quiet, hysterical chuckling. Joe found himself rather absurdly\nthinking that Sanford was not actually insane, except as any man may be\nwho believes only in his own cleverness. Sooner or later it is bound to\nfail him. On Earth, Sanford's pride in his own intellect had been\nuseful. He had been brilliant because he accepted every problem and\nevery difficulty as a challenge. But with the Platform's situation\nseemingly hopeless, he'd been starkly unable to face the fact that he\nwasn't clever or brilliant or intelligent enough. If Joe's solution to\nthe proximity fuse bombs had been offered before his emotional collapse,\nhe could have accepted it grandly, and in so doing have made it his own.\nBut it was too late for that now. He'd given up and worked up a frantic\nscorn for the universe he could not cope with. For Joe's trick to work\nwould have made him inferior even to Joe in his own view. And he\ncouldn't have that! Even to die, with the prospect that others would\nsurvive him, was an intolerable prospect. He had to be smarter than\nanybody else.\n\nSo he chuckled. The Chief roared wrathfully into his transmitter:\n\"Quiet! This crazy fool's tried to commit suicide for all of us! How\nabout it? Why can't we get back in? How many locks----\"\n\nJoe found himself thinking hard. He could be angry later. Now there\nwasn't time. Thirty or forty minutes of breathing. No tools. A steel\nhull. The airlocks were naturally arranged for the greatest possible\nsafety under normal conditions. In every airlock it had naturally been\narranged so that the door to space and the door to the interior could\nnot be open at the same time. That was to save lives. To save air, it\nwould naturally be arranged that the door to space couldn't be opened\nuntil the lock was pumped empty.\n\nThat in itself could be an answer. Joe said sharply, \"Hold it, Chief!\nSomebody watch Sanford! All we've got to do is find which lock he came\nout of. He couldn't get out until he pumped it empty--and that unlocks\nthe outer door!\"\n\nBut Sanford laughed once more. He sounded like someone in the highest of\nhigh good humor.\n\n\"Heroic again, eh? But I took a compressed air bottle in the lock with\nme. When the outer door was open, I opened the stopcock and shut the\ndoor. The air bottle filled the lock behind me. Naturally I'd fasten the\ndoor after I came out! One must be intelligent!\"\n\nJoe heard Brent muttering, \"Yes, he'd do that!\"\n\n\"Somebody check it!\" snapped Joe. \"Make sure! It might amuse him to\nwatch us die while he knew we could get back in if we were as smart as\nhe is.\"\n\nThere were clankings on the hull. Men moved, unfastening the lines which\nheld them to the hull to get freedom of movement, but not breaking the\nlinks which bound them to each other. Joe saw Haney go grimly back to\nthe task of throwing away the stuff that they had brought out for the\npurpose. Then Mike's voice, brittle and cagey: \"Haney! Quit it!\"\n\nSanford's voice again, horribly amused. \"By all means! Don't throw away\nour garbage! We may need it!\"\n\nA voice snapped, \"This lock's fastened.\" Another voice: \"And this....\"\nOther voices, with increasing desperation, verified that every airlock\nwas implacably sealed fast by the presence of air pressure inside the\nlock itself.\n\nTime was passing. Joe had never noticed, before, the minute noises of\nthe air pressure apparatus strapped to his back. His exhaled breath went\nto a tiny pump that forced it through a hygroscopic filter which at once\nextracted excess moisture and removed carbon dioxide. The same pump\ncarefully measured a volume of oxygen equal to the removed CO_2 and\nadded it to the air it released. The pump made very small sounds indeed,\nand the valves were almost noiseless, but Joe could hear their\nclickings.\n\nSomething burned him. He had been standing perfectly still while trying\nto concentrate on a way out. Sunshine had shone uninterruptedly on one\nside of his space suit for as long as five minutes. Despite the\ninsulation inside, that was too long. He turned quickly to expose\nanother part of himself to the sunlight. He knew abstractedly that the\nmetal underfoot would sear bare flesh that touched it. A few yards away,\nin the shadow, the metal of the hull would be cold enough to freeze\nhydrogen. But here it was fiercely hot. It would melt solder. It might--\n\nMike was fumbling tin cans out of the net bag from which Haney had been\nthrowing them away. He was a singular small figure, standing on shining\nsteel, looking at one tin can after another and impatiently putting them\naside.\n\nHe found one that seemed to suit him. It was a large can. He knelt with\nit, pressing a part of it to the hot metal of the satellite's hull. A\nmoment later he was ripping it apart. The solder had softened. He\nunrolled a sort of cylinder, then bent again, using the curved inner\nsurface to concentrate the intolerable sunshine.\n\nJoe caught his breath at the implication. Concentrated sunshine can be\nincredibly hot. Starting with unshielded, empty-space sunshine,\npractically any imaginable temperature is possible with a large enough\nmirror. Mike didn't have a concave mirror. He had only a cylindrical\none. He couldn't reflect light to a point, but only to a line. Mike\ncouldn't hope to do more than double or triple the temperature of a\ngiven spot. But considering what he wore on his back--!\n\nJoe made his way clumsily to the spot where Mike now gesticulated to\nHaney, trying to convey his meaning by gestures since Sanford would\noverhear any spoken word.\n\n\"I get it, Mike,\" said Joe. \"I'll help.\" He added: \"Chief! You watch\nSanford. The rest of you try to flatten out some tin cans or find some\nwith flat round ends!\"\n\nHe reached the spot where Mike bent over the plating. His hand moved to\ncast a shadow where the light had played.\n\n\"I need more reflectors,\" Mike said brusquely, \"but we can do it!\"\n\nJoe beckoned. There were more, hurried clankings. Space-suited figures\ngathered about.\n\nThe Platform rolled on through space. Where it was bright it was very,\nvery bright, and where it was dark it was blackness. Off in emptiness\nthe many-colored mass of Earth shone hugely, rolling past. Innumerable\nincurious stars looked on. The sun flamed malevolently. The moon floated\nabstractedly far away.\n\nMike was bent above a small round airlock door. He had a distorted\nhalf-cylinder of sheet tin between his space-gloved hands. It reflected\na line of intensified sunlight to the edge of the airlock seal. Haney\nripped fiercely at other tin cans. Joe held another strip of polished\nmetal. It focused crudely--very crudely--on top of Mike's line of\nreflected sunshine. Someone else held the end of a tin can to reflect\nmore sunshine. Someone else had a larger disk of tin.\n\nThey stood carefully still. It looked completely foolish. There were six\nmen in frozen attitudes, trying to reflect sunshine down to a single\nblindingly-bright spot on an airlock door. They seemed breathlessly\ntense. They ignored the glories of the firmament. They were utterly\nabsorbed in trying to make a spot of unbearable brightness glow more\nbrightly still.\n\nMike moved his hand to cast a shadow. The steel was a little more than\nred-hot for the space of an inch. It would not melt, of course. It could\nnot. And they had no tools to bend or pierce the presumably softened\nmetal. But Mike said fiercely:\n\n\"Keep it hot!\"\n\nHe squirmed. His space suit was fabric, like the rest, but it had been\ncut down to permit him to use it. It was bulkier on him than the suits\nof the others. He shifted his shoulder pack. The brass valve-nipple by\nwhich the oxygen tank was filled....\n\nHe jammed a ragged fragment of tin in place. He pressed down fiercely. A\nblazing jet of fierce, scintillating, streaking sparks leaped up from\nthe spot where the metal glowed brightly. A hollow in the metal plate\nappeared. The metal disintegrated in gushing flecks of light....\n\nWhite-hot iron in pure oxygen happens to be inflammable. Iron is not\nincombustible at all. Powdered steel, ground fine enough, will burn if\nsimply exposed to air. Really fine steel wool will make an excellent\nblaze if a match is touched to it. White-hot iron, with a jet of oxygen\nplayed upon it, explodes to steaming sparks. Technically, Mike had used\nthe perfectly well-known trick of an oxygen lance to pierce the airlock\ndoor, let the air out of the lock, and so allow the outer door to be\nopened.\n\nThere was a rush of vapor. The door was drilled through. Haney picked\nMike up bodily, Joe heaved the door open, and Haney climbed into it,\npractically carrying Mike by the scruff of the neck. Joe panted, \"Plug\nthe hole from the inside. Sit on it if you have to!\" and slammed the\ndoor shut.\n\nThey waited. Sanford's voice came in the ear-phones. It was higher in\npitch than it had been.\n\n\"You fools!\" he raged. \"It's useless! It's stupid to do useless things!\nIt's stupid to do anything at all--\"\n\nThere were sudden scuffling clankings. Joe swung about. The Chief and\nSanford were struggling. Sanford flailed his arms about, trying to break\nthe Chief's faceplate while he screamed furious things about futility.\n\nThe Chief got exactly the hold he wanted. He lifted Sanford from the\nmetal deck. He could have thrown him away to emptiness, then, but he did\nnot.\n\nHe set Sanford in mid-space as if upon a shelf. The raging man hung in\nthe void an exact man-height above the Platform's surface. The Chief\ndrew back and left him there, Sanford could writhe there for a century\nbefore the Platform's infinitesimal gravity brought him down.\n\n\"Huh!\" said the Chief wrathfully. \"How's Haney and Mike making out?\"\n\nAlmost on the instant, twenty yards away, a tiny airlock door thrust out\nfrom the surface of glittering metal, and helmet and antenna appeared.\n\n\"You guys can come in now,\" said Haney's voice in Joe's headphones.\n\"It's all okay. Mike's pumping out the other locks too, so you can come\nin at any of 'em.\"\n\nThe space-suited figures clumped loudly to airlock doors. There were a\ndozen or more small airlocks in various parts of the hull, besides the\ngreat door to admit supply ships. The Chief growled and moved toward\nSanford now raging like the madman his helplessness made him.\n\n\"No,\" said Joe shortly. \"He'd fight again. Go inside. That's an order,\nChief.\"\n\nThe Chief grunted and obeyed. Joe went to the nearest airlock and\nentered the great steel hull.\n\nSanford floated in emptiness, two yards from the Space Platform he would\nhave turned into a derelict. He did not move farther away. He did not\nfall toward it. There was nobody to listen to him. He cried out in\nblood-curdling fury because other men were smarter than he was. Other\nmen had solved problems he could not solve. Other men were his\nsuperiors. He screamed his rage.\n\nPresently the Platform revolved slowly beneath him. It was turned, of\ncourse, by the monster gyros which in turn were controlled by the pilot\ngyros Joe and Haney and the Chief and Mike had repaired when saboteurs\nsmashed them.\n\nThe Platform rotated sedately. A great gap appeared in it. The door of\nthe supply ship lock moved until Sanford, floating helplessly, was\nopposite its mouth.\n\nA rod with a rounded object at its end appeared past the docked supply\nship. It reached out and touched Sanford's helmet. It was the magnetic\ngrapple which drew space ships into their dock.\n\nIt drew Sanford, squirming and streaming, into the great lock. The outer\ndoors closed. Before air was admitted to the inside, Sanford went\nsuddenly still.\n\nWhen they took him out of his suit he was apparently unconscious. He\ncould not be roused. Freed, he drew his knees up to his chin in the\nposition in which primitive peoples bury their dead. He seemed to sleep.\nBrent examined him carefully.\n\n\"Catatonia,\" he said distastefully. \"He spent his life thinking he was\nsmarter than anybody else--smarter, probably, than all the universe. He\nbelieved it. He couldn't face the fact that he was wrong. He couldn't\nstay conscious and not know it. So he's blacked out. He refuses to be\nanything unless he can be smartest. We'll have to do artificial feeding\nand all that until we can get him down to Earth to a hospital.\" He\nshrugged.\n\n\"We'd better report this down to Earth,\" Joe said. \"By the way, better\nnot describe our screen of tin cans on radio waves. Not even microwaves.\nIt might leak. And we want to see if it works.\"\n\nJust forty-two hours later they found out that it did work. A single\nrocket came climbing furiously out from Earth. It came from the\nnight-side, and they could not see where it was launched, though they\ncould make excellent guesses. They got a single guided missile ready to\ncrash it if necessary.\n\nIt wasn't necessary. The bomb from Earth detonated 300 miles below the\nartificial satellite. Its proximity fuse, sending out small radar-type\nwaves, had them reflected back by an empty sardine can thrown away from\nthe Platform by Mike Scandia forty-some hours ago. The sardine can had\nbeen traveling in its own private orbit ever since. The effect of Mike's\nmuscles had not been to send it back to Earth, but to change the center\nof the circular orbit in which it floated. Sometimes it floated above\nthe Platform--that was on one side of Earth--and sometimes below it. It\nwas about 300 miles under the Platform when it reflected urgent,\nsquealing radar frequency waves to a complex proximity fuse in the\nclimbing rocket. The rocket couldn't tell the difference between a\nsardine can and a Space Platform.\n\nIt exploded with a blast of pure brightness like that of the sun.\n\nThe Platform went on its monotonous round about the planet from which it\nhad risen only weeks before. Sanford was strapped in a bunk and fed\nthrough a tube, and on occasion massaged and variously tended to keep\nhim alive. The men on the Platform worked. They made telephoto maps of\nEarth. They took highly magnified, long-exposure photographs of Mars,\npictures that could not possibly be made with such distinctness from the\nbottom of Earth's turbulent ocean of air.\n\nThere was a great deal of official business to be done. Weather\nobservations of the form and distribution of cloud masses were an\nimportant matter. The Platform could make much more precise measurements\nof the solar constant than could be obtained below. The flickering radar\nwas gathering information for studies of the frequency and size of\nmeteoric particles outside the atmosphere. There was the extremely\nimportant project for securing and sealing in really good vacua in\nvarious electronic devices brought up by Joe and his crew in the supply\nship.\n\nBut sometimes Joe managed to talk to Sally.\n\nIt was very satisfying to see her on the television screen in personal\nconversation. Their talk couldn't be exactly private, because it could\nbe picked up elsewhere. It probably was. But she told Joe how she felt,\nand she wanted to read him the newspaper stories based on the reports\nBrent had sent down. Brent was in command of the Platform now that\nSanford lay in a resolute coma in his bunk. But Joe discouraged such\nwaste of time.\n\n\"How's the food?\" asked Sally. \"Are you people getting any fresh\nvegetables from the hydroponic garden?\"\n\nThey were, and Joe told her so. The huge chamber in which sun-lamps\nglowed for a measured number of hours in each twenty-four produced\nincredibly luxuriant vegetation. It kept the air of the ship breathable.\nIt even changed the smell of it from time to time, so that there was no\nfeeling of staleness.\n\n\"And the cooking system's really good?\" she wanted to know. Sally was\npartly responsible for that, too. \"And how about the bunks?\"\n\n\"I sleep now,\" Joe admitted.\n\nThat had been difficult. It was possible to get used to weightlessness\nwhile awake. One would slip, sometimes, and find himself suddenly tense\nand panicky because he'd abruptly noticed all over again that he was\nfalling. But--and yet again Sally was partly responsible--the bunks were\ndesigned to help in that difficulty. Each bunk had an inflatable top\nblanket. One crawled in and settled down, and turned the petcock that\ninflated the cover. Then it held one quite gently but reassuringly in\nplace. It was possible to stir and to turn over, but the feeling of\nbeing held fast was very comforting. With a little care about what one\nthought of before going to sleep, one could get a refreshing eight\nhours' rest. The bunks were luxury.\n\nSally said: \"The date and time's a secret, of course, because it might\nbe overheard, but there'll be another ship up before too long. It's\nbringing landing rockets for you to come back with.\"\n\n\"That's good!\" said Joe. It would feel good to set foot on solid ground\nagain. He looked at Sally and said eagerly, \"We've got a date the\nevening I get back?\"\n\n\"We've got a date,\" she said, nodding.\n\nBut it couldn't very well be a definite date. There were people with\nideas that ran counter to plans for Joe to get back to Earth and a date\nwith Sally Holt. The Space Platform was not admired uniformly by all the\nnations of Earth. The United States had built it because the United\nNations couldn't, and one of the attractions of the idea had been that\nonce it got out to space and was armed, peace must reign upon Earth\nbecause it could smack down anybody who made war.\n\nThe trouble was that it wasn't armed well enough. Six guided missiles\ncouldn't defend it indefinitely. It looked as helpless as isolated\nBerlin did before the first airlift proved what men and planes could do\nin the way of transport. And the Platform's enemies didn't intend for it\nto be saved by a rocketlift. They would try to smash it before such a\nlift could get started.\n\nA week after Joe got to it with the guided missiles, three rockets\nattacked. They went up from somewhere in the middle of the Pacific. One\nblew up 250 miles below the Platform. Another detonated 190 miles away.\nFor safety's sake the third was crashed--at the cost of one guided\nmissile--when it had come within 50 miles.\n\nThe screen of tin cans worked, but it wasn't thick enough. The occupants\nof the Platform went about hunting for sheet metal that could be spared.\nThey pulled out minor partitions here and there, and went out on the\nsurface and threw away thousands of small glittering scraps of metal in\nall directions.\n\nTwo weeks later, there was another attack. It could be calculated that\nJoe couldn't have carried up more than six guided missiles. There might\nbe as few as two of them left. So eight rockets came up together--and\nthe first of them went off 400 miles from the Platform. Only one got as\nclose as 200 miles. No guided missiles were expended in defense.\n\nThe Platform's enemies tried once more. This time the rockets arched up\nabove the Platform's orbit and dived on the satellite from above. There\nwere two of them. They went off at 180 and 270 miles from the Platform.\nJoe's trash screen would not work on Earth, but in space it was an\nadequate defense against anything equipped with proximity fuses. It\ncould be assumed that in a full-scale space-war nuts, bolts, rusty nails\nand beer bottle caps would become essential military equipment.\n\nThree days after this last attack, a second supply ship took off from\nEarth. Lieutenant Commander Brown was a passenger. Its start was just\nlike the one Joe's ship had made. Pushpots lifted it, jatos hurled it\non, and then the furious, flaming take-off rockets drove it valiantly\nout toward the stars.\n\nJoe's ship had been moved out of the landing lock and was moored against\nthe Platform's hull. The second ship made contact in two hours and\nseventeen minutes from take-off. It arrived with its own landing rockets\nintact, and it brought a set of forty-foot metal tubes for Joe's ship to\nget back to Earth with. But those landing rockets and Lieutenant\nCommander Brown constituted all its payload. It couldn't bring up\nanything else.\n\nAnd Lieutenant Commander Brown called a very formal meeting in the huge\nliving space at the Platform's center. He stood up grandly in full\nuniform--and had to hook his feet around a chair leg to keep from\nfloating absurdly in mid-air. This detracted slightly from the dignity\nof his stance, but not from the official voice with which he read two\ndocuments aloud.\n\nThe first paper detached Lieutenant Commander Brown from his regular\nnaval duties and assigned him pro tem to service with the Space\nExploration Project. The second was an order directing him to take\ncommand and assume direction of the Space Platform.\n\nHaving read his orders, he cleared his throat and said cordially, \"I am\nhonored to serve here with you. Frankly, I expect to learn much from you\nand to have very few orders to give. I expect merely to exercise such\nauthority as experience at sea has taught me is necessary for a tight\nand happy ship. I trust this will be one.\"\n\nHe beamed. Nobody was impressed. It was perfectly obvious that he'd\nsimply been sent up to acquire experience in space for later naval use,\nand that he'd been placed in command because it was unthinkable that he\nserve under anyone without official rank and authority. And he quite\nhonestly believed that his coming, with experience in command, was a\nblessing to the Platform. In fact, there was no danger that this\ncommander of the Platform would crack up under stress as Sanford had.\n\nBut it was too bad that he hadn't brought some long-range guided\nmissiles with him.\n\nJoe's ship had brought up twenty tons of cargo and twenty tons of\nlanding rockets. The second ship brought up twenty tons of landing\nrockets for Joe, and twenty tons of landing rockets for itself. That was\nall. The second trip out to the Space Platform was a rescue mission and\nnothing else. Arithmetic wouldn't let it be anything else. And there\ncouldn't be any idea of noble self-sacrifice and staying out at the\nPlatform, either, because only four ships like Joe's had been begun, and\nonly two were even near completion. Joe's had taken off the instant it\nwas finished. The second had done the same. The second pair of\nspaceships wouldn't be ready for two months or more. The ships that\ncould be used had to be used.\n\nSo, only thirty-six hours after the arrival of the second rocketship at\nthe Platform, the two of them took off together to return to Earth.\nJoe's ship left the airlock first. Sanford was loaded in the cabin of\nthe other ship as cargo. Lieutenant Commander Brown stayed out at the\nPlatform to replace him.\n\nObviously, in order to get back to Earth they headed away from it in\nfleet formation. They pointed their rounded noses toward the Milky Way.\n\nThe upward course was an application of the principle that made the\nscreen of tin cans and oddments remain about the Platform. Each of\nthose small objects had had the Platform's own velocity and orbit.\nThrown away from it, the centers of their orbits changed. In theory,\nthe center of the Platform's orbit was the center of Earth. But the\ncenters of the orbits of the thrown-away objects were pushed a few\nmiles--twenty--fifty--a hundred--away from the center of Earth.\n\nThe returning space ships also had the orbit and speed of the Platform.\nThey wanted to shift the centers of their orbits by very nearly 4,000\nmiles, so that at one point they would just barely graze Earth's\natmosphere, lose some speed to it, and then bounce out to empty space\nagain before they melted. Cooled off, they'd make another grazing\nbounce. After eight such bounces they'd stay in the air, and the stubby\nfins would give them a sort of gliding angle and controllability, while\nthe landing rockets would let them down to solid ground. Or so it was\nhoped.\n\nMeanwhile they headed out instead of in toward Earth. They went out on\ntheir steering-rockets only, using the liquid fuel that had not been\nneeded for course correction on the way out. At 4,000 miles up, the\nforce of gravity is just one-fourth of that at the Earth's surface. It\nstill exists; it is merely canceled out in an orbit. The ships could\nmove outward at less cost in fuel than they could move in.\n\nSo they went out and out on parallel courses, and the Platform dwindled\nbehind them. Night flowed below until the hull of the artificial\nsatellite shone brightly against a background of seeming sheer\nnothingness.\n\nThe twilight zone of Earth's shadow reached the Platform. It glowed\nredly, glowed crimson, glowed the deepest possible color that could be\nseen, and winked out. The ships climbed on, using their tiny steering\nrockets.\n\nNothing happened. The ships drew away from each other for safety. They\nwere 50, then 60 miles apart. One glowed red and vanished in the shadow\nof the Earth. The other was extinguished in the same way. Then they went\nhurtling through the blackness of the night side of Earth. Microwaves\nfrom the ground played upon them--radar used by friend and foe\nalike--and the friendly radar guided tight-beam communicator waves to\nthem with comforting assurance that their joint course and height and\nspeed were exactly the calculated optimum. But they could not be seen at\nall.\n\nWhen they appeared again they were still farther out from Earth than the\nPlatform's orbit, but no farther from each other. And they were\ndescending. The centers of their orbits had been displaced very, very\nfar indeed.\n\nGoing out, naturally, the ships had lost angular speed as they gained\nin height. Descending, they gained in angular velocity as they lost\nheight. They were not quite 30 miles apart as they sped with increasing,\nheadlong speed and rushed toward the edge of the world's disk. When they\nwere only 2,000 miles high, the Earth's surface under them moved much\nfaster than it had on the way up. When they were only 1,000 miles high,\nthe seas and continents seemed to flow past like a rushing river. At 500\nmiles, mountains and plains were just distinguishable as they raced past\nunderneath. At 200 miles there was merely a churning, hurtling surface\non which one could not focus one's eyes because of the speed of its\nmovement.\n\nThey missed the solid surface of Earth by barely 40 miles. They were\nmoving at a completely impossible speed. The energy of their position\n4,000 miles high had been transformed into kinetic energy of motion. And\nat 40 miles there is something very close to a vacuum, compared to\nsea-level. But compared to true emptiness, and at the speed of meteors,\nthe thin air had a violent effect.\n\nA thin humming sound began. It grew louder. The substance of the ship\nwas responding to the impact of the thin air upon it. The sound rose to\na roar, to a bellow, to a thunderous tumult. The ship quivered and\ntrembled. It shook. A violent vibration set up and grew more and more\nsavage. The whole ship shook with a dreadful persistence, each vibration\nmore monstrous, more straining, more ominous than before.\n\nThe four in the space ship cabin knew torture. Weight returned to them,\nweight more violent than the six gravities they had known for a bare\nfourteen seconds at take-off. But that, at least, had been smoothly\napplied. This was deceleration at a higher figure yet, and accompanied\nby the shaking of bodies which weighed seven times as much as ever\nbefore--and bodies, too, which for weeks past had been subject to no\nweight at all.\n\nThey endured. Nothing at all could be done. At so many miles per second\nno possible human action could be determined upon and attempted in time\nto have any effect upon the course of the ship. Joe could see out a\nquartzite port. The ground 40 miles below was merely a blur. There was\na black sky overhead, which did not seem to stir. But cloud-masses\nrushed at express-train speed below him, and his body weighed more than\nhalf a ton, and the ship made the sound of innumerable thunders and\nshook, and shook and shook....\n\nAnd then, when it seemed that it must fly utterly to pieces, the thunder\ndiminished gradually to a bellow, and the bellow to a roar, and the\nroaring.... And the unthinkable weight oppressing him grew less.\n\nThe Earth was farther away and moving farther still. They were 100 miles\nhigh. They were 200 miles high....\n\nThere was no longer any sound at all, except their gaspings for breath.\nTheir muscles had refused to lift their chests at all during the most\nbrutal of the deceleration period.\n\nPresently Joe croaked a question. He looked at the hull-temperature\nindicators. They were very, very high. He found that he was bruised\nwhere he had strapped himself in. The places where each strap had held\nhis heavy body against the ship's vibrations were deeply black-and-blue.\n\nThe Chief said thickly: \"Joe, somehow I don't think this is going to\nwork. When do we hit again?\"\n\n\"Three hours plus or minus something,\" said Joe, dry-throated. \"We'll\nhear from the ground.\"\n\nMike said in a cracked voice: \"Radar reports we went a little bit too\nlow. They think we weren't tilted up far enough. We didn't bounce as\nsoon as we should.\"\n\nJoe unstrapped himself.\n\n\"How about the other ship?\"\n\n\"It did better than we did,\" said Mike. \"It's a good 200 miles ahead.\nDown at the Shed, they're recalculating for us. We'll have to land with\nsix grazes instead of eight. We lost too much speed.\"\n\nJoe went staggering, again weightless, to look out a port for the other\nship. He should have known better. One does not spot an eighty-foot\nspace ship with the naked eye when it is 200 miles away.\n\nBut he saw something, though for seconds he didn't know what it was.\n\nNow the little ship was 300 miles high and still rising. Joe was dazed\nand battered by the vibration of the ship in the graze just past. The\nsister space ship hadn't lost speed so fast. It would be traveling\nfaster. It would be leaving him farther behind every second. It was\nrising more sharply. It would rise higher.\n\nJoe stared numbly out of a port, thinking confusedly that his hull would\nbe dull red on its outer surface, though the heating had been so fast\nthat the inner surfaces of the plating might still be cold. He saw the\nvast area which was the curve of the edge of the world. He saw the\nsunlight upon clouds below and glimpses of the surface of the Earth\nitself.\n\nAnd he saw something rising out of the mists at the far horizon. It was\na thread of white vapor. The other rocketship was a speck, a mote,\ninvisible because of its size and distance. This thread of vapor was\nalready 100 miles long, and it expanded to a column of whiteness half a\nmile across before it seemed to dissipate. It rose and rose, as if\nfollowing something which sped upward. It was a rocket trail. The\nviolence of its writhings proved the fury with which the rocket climbed.\n\nIt was on its way to meet the other space ship.\n\nIt did. Joe saw the thread of vapor extend and grow until it was higher\nthan he was. He never saw the other ship, which was too small. But he\nsaw the burst of flame, bright as the sun itself, which was the\nexplosion of a proximity fuse bomb. He knew, then, that nothing but\nincandescent, radioactive gas remained of the other ship and its crew.\n\nThen he saw the trail of the second rocket. It was rising to meet him.\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nThe four of them watched through the ports as the thread of vapor sped\nupward. They hated the rocket and the people who had built it. Joe said\nbetween his teeth, \"We could spend our landing-rockets and make it\nchase us, but it'll have fuel for that!\"\n\nThe Chief muttered in Mohawk. The words sounded as if they ought to have\nblue fire at their edges and smell of sulphur. Mike the midget said\ncrackling things in his small voice. Haney stared, his eyes burning.\n\nTheir ship was a little over 400 miles up, now. The rocket was 100 or\nbetter. The rendezvous would be probably 200 miles ahead and\ncorrespondingly higher. The rocket was accelerating furiously. It had\nfarther to travel, but its rate of climb was already enormous and it\nincreased every second.\n\nThe ship could swing to right or left on steering rockets, but the war\nrocket could swerve also. It was controlled from the ground. It did not\nneed to crash the small ship from space. Within a limited number of\nmiles the blast of its atomic warhead would vaporize any substance that\ncould exist. And of course the ship could not turn back. Even the\nexpenditure of all its landing-rockets could not bring twenty tons of\nship to a halt. They could speed it up, so it would pass the calculated\nmeeting place ahead of the war rocket. But the bomb would simply follow\nin a stern chase. In any case, the ship could not stop.\n\nBut neither could the rocket.\n\nJoe never knew how he saw the significance of that fact. On land or sea,\nof course, an automobile or a ship moves in the direction in which it is\npointed. Even an airplane needs to make only minor corrections for air\ncurrents which affect it. But an object in space moves on a course which\nis the sum of all its previous speeds and courses. Joe's ship was moving\neastward above the Earth at so many miles per second. If he drove\nnorth--at a right angle to his present course--the ship would not cease\nto move to the east. It would simply move northward in addition to\nmoving east. If the rocket from Earth turned north or east it would\ncontinue to move up and merely add the other motion to its vertical\nrise.\n\nJoe stared at the uncoiling thread of vapor which was the murder\nrocket's trail. He hated it so fiercely that he wanted to escape it\neven at the cost of destruction, merely to foil its makers. At one\nmoment, he was hardly aware of anything but his own fury and the frantic\ndesire to frustrate the rocket at any cost. The next instant, somehow,\nhe was not angry at all. Because somehow his brain had dredged up the\nfact that the war rocket could no more turn back than he could--and he\nsaw its meaning.\n\n\"Mike!\" he snapped sharply. \"Get set! Report what we do! Everybody set\nfor acceleration! Steering rockets ready, Chief! Get set to help, Haney!\nI don't know whether we'll get out of this alive, but we'd better get\ninto our space suits.\"\n\nThen he literally dived back to his acceleration chair and strapped in\nin feverish haste. The ship was then a quarter of the way to the meeting\nplace and the rocket had very much farther to go. But it was rising\nfaster.\n\nThe ship's gyros whined and squealed as Joe jammed on their controls.\nThe little ship spun in emptiness. Its bow turned and pointed down. The\nsteering rockets made their roarings.\n\nJoe found himself panting. \"The--rocket's rising faster--than we are.\nIt's been gaining--altitude maybe--two minutes. It's lighter than\nwhen--it started but--it can't stop--less than a minute, anyhow so we\nduck under it----\"\n\nHe did not make computations. There was no time. The war rocket might\nhave started at four or five gravities acceleration, but it would speed\nup as its fuel burned. It might be accelerating at fifteen gravities\nnow, and have an attained velocity of four miles a second and still\nincreasing. If the little ship ducked under it, it could not kill that\nrate-of-climb in time to follow in a stern chase.\n\n\"Haney!\" panted Joe. \"Watch out the port! Are we going to make it?\"\n\nHaney crawled forward. Joe had forgotten the radar because he'd seen the\nrocket with his own eyes. It seemed to need eyes to watch it. Mike spoke\ncurtly into the microphone broadcasting to ground. He was reporting each\naction and order as it took place and was given. There was no time to\nexplain anything. But Mike thought of the radar. He watched it.\n\nIt showed the vast curve of Earth's surface, 400 miles down. It showed a\nmoving pip, much too much nearer, which was the war rocket. Mike made a\ndot on the screen with a grease pencil where the pip showed. It moved.\nHe made another dot. The pip continued to move. He made other dots.\n\nThey formed a curving line--curved because the rocket was\naccelerating--which moved inexorably toward the center of the radar\nscreen. The curve would cut the screen's exact center. That meant\ncollision.\n\n\"Too close, Joe!\" said Mike shrilly. \"We may miss it, but not enough!\"\n\n\"Then hold fast,\" yelled Joe. \"Landing rockets firing, three--two--one!\"\n\nThe bellowing of the landing-rockets smote their ears. Weight seized\nupon them, three gravities of acceleration toward the rushing flood of\nclouds and solidity which was the Earth. The ship plunged downward with\nall its power. It was intolerable--and ten times worse because they had\nbeen weightless so long and were still shaken and sore and bruised from\nthe air-graze only minutes back.\n\nMike took acceleration better than the others, but his voice was thin\nwhen he gasped, \"Looks--like this does it, Joe!\" Seconds later he gasped\nagain, \"Right! The rocket's above us and still going away!\"\n\nThe gyros squealed again. The ship plunged into vapor which was the\ntrail of the enemy rocket. For an instant the flowing confusion which\nwas Earth was blotted out. Then it was visible again. The ship was\nplunging downward, but its sidewise speed was undiminished and much\ngreater than its rate of fall.\n\n\"Mike,\" panted Joe. \"Get the news out. What we did--and why. I'm--going\nto turn the ship's head back on our--course. We can't slow enough\nbut--I'd rather crash on Earth than let them blast us----\"\n\nThe ship turned again. It pointed back in the direction from which it\nhad come. With the brutal sternward pressure produced by the\nlanding-rockets, it felt as if it were speeding madly back where it had\ncome from. It was the sensation they'd felt when the ship took off from\nEarth, so long before. But then the cloud masses and the earth beneath\nhad flowed toward the ship and under it. Now they flowed away. The\nappearance was that of an unthinkably swift wake left behind by a ship\nat sea. The Earth's surface fled away and fled away from them.\n\n\"Crazy, this!\" Joe muttered thickly. \"If the ship were lighter--or we\nhad more power--we could land! I'm sorry, but I'd rather----\"\n\nHaney turned his head from where he clung near the bow-ports. His\nfeatures changed slowly as he talked because of acceleration-driven\nblood engorging his lips and bloating his cheeks. After one instant he\nclosed his eyes fiercely. They felt as if they would pop out of his\nhead. He gasped, \"Yes! Get down to air-resistance. A chance--not good\nbut a chance--ejection seats--with space suits--might make it....\"\n\nHe began to let himself back toward his acceleration chair. He could not\npossibly have climbed forward. It was a horrible task to let himself\ndown, with triple his normal weight pulling at him and after the beating\ntaken a little while ago.\n\nSweat stood out on his skin as he lowered himself sternward. Once his\ngrip on a hand-line slipped and he had to sustain the drag of nearly six\nhundred pounds by a single hand and arm. It would not be a good idea to\nfall at three gravities.\n\nThe landing rockets roared and roared, and Joe tilted the bow down a\nlittle farther, so that the streaming flood of clouds drew nearer.\n\nHaney got to his acceleration chair. He let himself into it and his eyes\nclosed.\n\nMike's sharp voice barked: \"What's the chance, Haney?\"\n\nHaney's mouth opened, and closed, and opened again. \"Rocket flames,\" he\ngasped, \"pushed back--wind--splash on hull--may melt--lighten\nweight--hundred to one against----\"\n\nThe odds were worse than that. The ship couldn't land because its\nmomentum was too great for the landing rockets to cancel out. If it had\nweighed five tons instead of twenty, landing might have been possible.\nHaney was saying that if the ship were to be lowered into air while\nrushing irresistibly sternward despite its rockets, that the rocket\nflames might be splashed out by the wind. Instead of streaking astern in\na lance-like shape, they might be pushed out like a rocket blast when it\nhits the earth in a guided missile take-off. Such a blast spreads out\nflat in all directions. Here the rocket flames might be spread by wind\nuntil they played upon the hull of the ship. If they did, they might\nmelt it as they melted their own steel cases in firing. And\nthree-fourths or more of the hull might be torn loose from the cabin bow\nsection. So much was unlikely, but it was possible.\n\nThe impossible odds were that the four could survive even if the cabin\nwere detached. They were decelerating at three gravities now. If part of\nthe ship burned or melted or was torn away, the rocket thrust might\nspeed the cabin up to almost any figure. And there is a limit to the\nnumber of gravities a man can take, even in an acceleration chair.\n\nNevertheless, that was what Haney proposed. They were due to be killed\nanyhow. Joe tried it.\n\nHe dived into atmosphere. At 60 miles altitude a thin wailing seemed to\ndevelop without reason. At 40 miles, the ship had lost more than two\nmiles per second of its speed since the landing-rockets were ignited,\nand there was a shuddering in all its fabric--though because of the loss\nof speed it was not as bad as the atmosphere-graze. At 30 it began to\nshake and tremble. At 25 miles high there was as horrible a vibration\nand as deadly a deceleration as at the air-graze. At 12 miles above the\nsurface of the Earth the hull temperature indicators showed the hind\npart of the hull at red heat. The ship happened to be traveling backward\nat several times the speed of sound, and air could not move away from\nbefore it. It was compressed to white heat at the entering surface, and\nthe metal plating went to bright red heat at that point. But the hull\njust aft of the rocket mouths was hotter still. There the splashing\nrocket flames bathed it in intolerable incandescence. Hull plates,\nbraces and beams glared white----\n\nThe tip of the tail caved in. The ship's empty cargo space was\ninstantly filled with air at intolerable pressure and heat.\n\nThe hull exploded outward where the rocket flames played. There was a\nmonstrous, incredible jerking of the cabin that remained. That fraction\nof the ship received the full force of the rocket thrust. They could\ndecelerate it at a rate of fifteen gravities or more.\n\nThey did.\n\nJoe lost consciousness as instantly and as peacefully as if he had been\nhit on the jaw.\n\nAn unknown but brief time later, he found himself listening with a\npeculiar astonishment. The rockets had burned out. They had lasted only\nseconds after the separation of the ship into two fragments. Radars on\nthe ground are authority for this. Those few seconds were extremely\nimportant. The cabin lost an additional half-mile per second of\nvelocity, which was enough to make the difference between the cabin\nheating up too, and the cabin being not quite destroyed.\n\nThe cabin remnant was heavy, of course, but it was an irregular object,\nsome twenty feet across. It was below orbital velocity, and\nwind-resistance slowed it. Even so, it traveled 47 miles to the east in\nfalling the last 10 miles to Earth. It hit a hillside and dug itself a\n70-foot crater in the ground.\n\nBut there was nobody in it, then. A little over a month before, it had\nseemed to Joe that ejection seats were the most useless of all possible\npieces of equipment to have in a space ship. He'd been as much mistaken\nas anybody could be. With an ejection seat, a jet pilot can be shot out\nof a plane traveling over Mach one, and live to tell about it. This\ncrumpling cabin fell fast, but Joe stuffed Mike in an ejection seat and\nshot him out. He and the Chief dragged Haney to a seat, and then the\nChief shoved Joe off--and the four of them, one by one, were flung out\ninto a screaming stream of air. But the ribbon-parachutes did not burst.\nThey nearly broke the necks of their passengers, but they let them down\nalmost gently.\n\nAnd it was quite preposterous, but all four landed intact. Mike, being\nlightest and first to be ejected, came down by himself in a fury because\nhe'd been treated with special favor. The Chief and Joe landed almost\ntogether. After a long time, Joe staggered out of his space suit and\nharness and tried to help the Chief, and they held each other up as they\nstumbled off together in search of Haney.\n\nWhen they found him he was sleeping heavily, exhausted, in a canebrake.\nHe hadn't even bothered to disengage his parachute harness or take off\nhis suit.\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nA good deal of that landing remained confused in Joe's mind. While it\nwas going on he was much too busy to be absorbing impressions. When he\nlanded, he was as completely exhausted as anybody wants to be. It was\nonly during the next day that he even tried to sort out his\nrecollections.\n\nThen he woke up suddenly, with a muffled roaring going on all about him.\nHe blinked his eyes open and listened. Presently he realized what the\nnoise was, and wondered that he hadn't realized before. It was the\nroaring of the motors of a multi-engined plane. He knew, without\nremembering the details at the moment, that he and the other three were\non a plane bound across the Pacific for America. He was in a bunk--and\nhe felt extraordinarily heavy. He tried to move, and it was an enormous\neffort to move his arm. He struggled to turn over, and found straps\nholding his body down.\n\nHe fumbled at them. They had readily releasable clasps, and he loosened\nthem easily. After a bit he struggled to sit upright. He was horribly\nheavy or horribly weak. He couldn't tell which. And each separate muscle\nin his whole body ached. Twinges of pain accompanied every movement. He\nsat up, swaying a little with the slow movements of the plane, and\ngradually, things came back.\n\nThe landing in the ribbon-chute. They'd come down somewhere on the west\ncoast of India, not too far from the sea. He remembered crashing into\nthe edge of a thin jungle and finding the Chief, and the two of them\nsearching out Haney and stumbling to open ground. After laying out a\nsignal for air searchers, they went off into worn-out slumber while they\nwaited.\n\nHe remembered that there'd been a patrol of American destroyers in the\nArabian Sea, as everywhere under the orbit of the Platform. Their radar\nhad reported the destruction of one space ship and the frantic diving of\nthe other, its division into two parts, and then the tiny objects, which\nflew out from the smaller cabin section, which had descended as only\nejection-seat parachutes could possibly have done. Two destroyers\nsteamed onward underneath those drifting specks, to pick them up when\nthey should come down. But the other nearby destroyers had other\nbusiness in hand.\n\nThe two trailing destroyers reached Goa harbor within hours of the\nlanding of the four from space. A helicopter found the first three of\nthem within hours after that. They were twenty miles inland and thirty\nsouth from Goa. Mike wasn't located until the next day. He'd been shot\nout of the ship's cabin earlier and higher; he was lighter, and he'd\nfloated farther.\n\nBut things--satisfying things--had happened in the interval. Sitting\nalmost dizzily on the bunk in the swiftly roaring plane while blood\nbegan sluggishly to flow through his body, Joe remembered the gleeful,\nunofficial news passed around on the destroyers. They waited for Mike to\nbe brought in. But they rejoiced vengefully.\n\nThe report was quite true, but it never reached the newspapers. Nobody\nwould ever admit it, but the rockets aimed at the returning space ships\nhad been spotted by Navy radar as they went up from the Arabian Sea. And\nthe ships of the radar patrol couldn't do anything about the rockets,\nbut they could and did converge savagely upon the places from which they\nhad been launched. Planes sped out to spot and bomb. Destroyers arrived.\n\nSomewhere there was a navy department that could write off two modern\nsubmarines with rocket-launching equipment, last heard from west of\nIndia. American naval men would profess bland ignorance of any such\nevent, but there were acres of dead fish floating on the ocean where\ndepth-bombs had hunted down and killed two shapes much too big to be\nfish, which didn't float when they were killed and which would never\nreport back how they'd destroyed two space ships. There'd be seagulls\nfeasting over that area, and there'd be vague tales about the happening\nin the bazaars of Hadhramaut. But nobody would ever admit knowing\nanything for certain.\n\nBut Joe knew. He got to his feet, wobbling a little bit in the soaring\nplane. He ached everywhere. His muscles protested the strain of holding\nhim erect. He held fast, summoning strength. Before his little ship\nbroke up he'd been shaken intolerably, and his body had weighed half a\nton. Where his safety-belt had held him, his body was one wide bruise.\nThere'd been that killing acceleration when the ship split in two. The\nothers--except Mike--were in as bad a case or worse. Haney and the Chief\nwere like men who'd been rolled down Mount Everest in a barrel. All of\nthem had slept for fourteen hours straight before they even woke up for\nfood. Even now, Joe didn't remember boarding this plane or getting into\nthe bunk. He'd probably been carried in.\n\nJoe stood up, doggedly, until enough strength came to him to justify his\nsitting down again. He began to dress. It was astonishing how many\nplaces about his body were sore to the touch. It was startling how heavy\nhis arms and legs felt, and how much of an effort even sitting erect\nwas. But he began to remember Mike's adventure, and managed to grin\nfeebly. It was the only thing worth a smile in all the things that had\nhappened.\n\nBecause Mike's landing had been quite unlike the others. Joe and the\nChief landed near the edge of a jungle. Haney landed in a canebrake. But\nMike came floating down from the sky, swaying splendidly, into the\nestate of a minor godling.\n\nHe was relatively unharmed by the shaking-up he'd had. The strength of\nmuscles depends on their cross-section, but their weight depends on\ntheir volume. The strength of a man depends on the square of his size,\nbut his weight on the cube. So Mike had taken the deceleration and the\nmurderous vibration almost in his stride. He floated longer and landed\nmore gently than the rest.\n\nJoe grinned painfully at the memory of Mike's tale. He'd come on board\nthe rescue destroyer in a towering, explosive rage. When his\nribbon-parachute let him down out of the sky, it deposited him gently on\nploughed fields not far from a small and primitive Hindu village. He'd\nbeen seen to descend from the heavens. He was a midget--not as other\nmen--and he was dressed in a space suit with glittering metal harness.\n\nThe pagan villagers greeted him with rapture.\n\nWhen the searching-party found Mike, they were just in time to prevent a\nmassacre--by Mike. Adoring natives had seized upon him, conveyed him in\nhigh state to a red mud temple, seemingly tried to suffocate him with\nevidences of their pride and joy at his arrival, and dark-skinned\nmaidens were trying hopefully to win his approval of their dancing. But\nthe rescue-party found him with a club in his hand and blood in his eye,\nsetting out furiously to change the tone of his reception.\n\nJoe still didn't know all the details, but he tried to concentrate on\nwhat he did know as he put his uniform on again. He didn't want to think\nhow little it meant, now. The silver space ship badge didn't mean a\nthing, any more. There weren't any more space ships. The Platform wasn't\na ship, but a satellite. There'd never been but two ships. Both had\nceased to exist.\n\nJoe walked painfully forward in the huge, roaring plane. The motors made\na constant, humming thunder in his ears. It was not easy to walk. He\nheld on to handholds as he moved. But he progressed past the bunk space.\nAnd there was Mike, sitting at a table and stuffing himself with good\nhonest food. There was a glass port beside him, and Joe caught a glimpse\nof illimitable distances filled with cloud and sky and sea.\n\nMike nodded. He didn't offer to help Joe walk. That wouldn't have been\npractical. He waited until Joe sank into a seat opposite.\n\n\"Good sleep?\" asked Mike.\n\n\"I guess so,\" said Joe. He added ruefully, \"It hurts to nod, and I think\nit would hurt worse to shake my head. What's the matter with me, Mike? I\ndidn't get banged up in the landing!\"\n\n\"You got banged up before you landed,\" said Mike. \"Worse than that, you\nspent better than six weeks out of gravity, where in an average day you\ntook less actual exercise than a guy in bed with two broken legs!\"\n\nJoe eased himself back into his chair. He felt about 600 years old.\nSomebody poked a head into view and withdrew it. Joe lifted his arm and\nregarded it.\n\n\"Weighty! I guess you're right, Mike.\"\n\n\"I know I'm right!\" said Mike. \"If you spent six weeks in bed you'd\nexpect to feel wobbly when you tried to walk. Up on the Platform you\ndidn't even use energy to stand up! We didn't realize it, but we were\nliving like invalids! We'll get our strength back, but next time we'll\ntake measures. Huh! Take a trip to Mars in free fall, and by the time a\nguy got there his muscles'd be so flabby he couldn't stand up in\nhalf-gravity! Something's got to be done about that, Joe!\"\n\nJoe said sombrely, \"Something's got to be done about space ships before\nthat comes up again!\"\n\nSomebody appeared with a tray. There was food on it. Smoking hot food.\nJoe looked at it and knew that his appetite, anyhow, was back to Earth\nnormal.\n\n\"Thanks!\" he mumbled appreciatively, and attacked the food.\n\nMike drank his coffee. Then he said, \"Joe, do you know anything about\npowder metallurgy?\"\n\nJoe shrugged. It hurt. \"Powder metallurgy? Yes, I've seen it used, at my\nfather's plant. They've made small precision parts with it. Why?\"\n\n\"D'you know if anybody ever made a weld with it?\" asked Mike.\n\nJoe chewed. Then he said:\n\n\"I think so. Yes. At the plant they did. They had trouble getting the\nsurfaces properly cleaned for welding. But they managed it. Why?\"\n\n\"One more question,\" said Mike tensely. \"How much Portland cement is\nused to make a cubic yard of concrete?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't know,\" admitted Joe. \"Why? What's all this about?\"\n\n\"Haney and the Chief. Those two big apes have been kidding me--as long\nas they could stay awake--for what happened to me when I landed. Those\ninfernal savages--\" Mike seethed. \"They got my clothes off and they had\nme smeared all over with butter and forty-'leven necklaces around my\nneck and flowers in my hair! They thought I was some kind of heathen\ngod! Hanuman, somebody told me. The Hindu monkey-god!\" He raged. \"And\nthose two big apes think it's funny! Joe, I never knew I _knew_ all the\nwords for the cussings I gave those heathen before our fellas found me!\nAnd Haney and the Chief will drive me crazy if I can't slap 'em down!\nPowder metallurgy does the trick, from what you told me. That's okay,\nthen.\"\n\nHe stood up and stalked toward the front of the plane. Joe roused\nhimself with an effort. He turned to look about him. Haney lay slumped\nin a reclining chair, on the other side of the plane cabin. His eyes\nwere closed. The Chief lay limply in another chair. He smiled faintly at\nJoe, but he didn't try to talk. He was too tired. The return to normal\ngravity bothered him, as it did Joe.\n\nJoe looked out the window. In neat, geometric spacing on either side of\nthe transport there were fighter jets. There was another flight above\nand farther away. Joe saw, suddenly, a peeling-off of planes from the\nfarther formation. They dived down through the clouds. He never knew\nwhat they went to look for or what they found. He went groggily back to\nhis bunk in a strange and embarrassing weakness.\n\nHe woke when the plane landed. He didn't know where it might be. It was,\nhe knew, an island. He could see the wide, sun-baked white of the\nrunways. He could see sea-birds in clouds over at the edge. The plane\ntrundled and lurched slowly to a stop. A service-truck came growling\nup, and somebody led cables from it up into the engines. Somebody\nwatched dials, and waved a hand.\n\nThere was silence. There was stillness. Joe heard voices and footsteps.\nPresently he heard the dull booming of surf.\n\nThe plane seemed to wait for a very long time. Then there was a faint,\nfaint distant whine of jets, and a plane came from the east. It was\nfirst a dot and then a vague shape, and then an infinitely graceful dark\nobject which swooped down and landed at the other end of the strip. It\ncame taxiing up alongside the transport ship and stopped.\n\nAn officer in uniform climbed out, waved his hand, and walked over to\nthe transport. He climbed up the ladder and the pilot and co-pilot\nfollowed him. They took their places. The door closed. One by one, the\njets chugged, then roared to life.\n\nThe officer talked to the pilot and co-pilot for a moment. He came down\nthe aisle toward Joe. Mike the midget regarded him suspiciously.\n\nThe plane stirred. The newly arrived officer said pleasantly, \"The Navy\nDepartment's sent me out here, Kenmore, to be briefed on what you know\nand to do a little briefing in turn.\"\n\nThe transport plane turned clumsily and began to taxi down the runway.\nIt jolted and bumped over the tarmac, then lifted, and Joe saw that the\nisland was nearly all airfield. There were a few small buildings and\ndistance-dwarfed hangars. Beyond the field proper there was a ring of\nwhite surf. That was all. The rest was ocean.\n\n\"I haven't much briefing to do,\" admitted Joe.\n\nThen he looked at the briefcase the other man opened. It had sheets and\nsheets of paper in it--hundreds, it seemed. They were filled with\nquestions. He'd be called on to find answers for most of them, and to\nadmit he didn't know the answers to the rest. When he was through with\nthis questioning, every possible useful fact he knew would be on file\nfor future use. And now he wrily recognized that this was part payment\nfor the efficiency and speed with which the Navy had trailed them on\ntheir landing, and for the use of a transport plane to take them back to\nthe United States.\n\n\"I'll try to answer what I can,\" he said cautiously. \"But what're you to\nbrief me about?\"\n\n\"That you're not back on Earth yet,\" said the officer curtly, pulling\nout the first sheaf of questions. \"Officially you haven't even started\nback. Ostensibly you're still on the Platform.\"\n\nJoe blinked at him.\n\n\"If your return were known,\" continued the lieutenant, \"the public would\nwant to make heroes of you. First space travelers, and so on. They'd\nwant you on television--all of you--telling about your adventures and\nyour return. Inevitably, what happened to your ship would leak out. And\nif the public knew you'd been waylaid and shot down there'd be demands\nthat the government take violent action to avenge the attack. It'd be\nsomething like the tumult over the sinking of the _Maine_, or the\n_Lusitania_--or even Pearl Harbor. It's much better for your return to\nbe a secret for now.\"\n\nJoe said wrily: \"I don't think any of us want to be ridden around to\nhave ticker-tape dumped on us. That part's all right. I'm sure the\nothers will agree.\"\n\n\"Good! One more difficulty. We had two space ships. Now we have none.\nOur most likely enemies haven't only been building rockets, they've got\na space fleet coming along. Intelligence just found out they're nearly\nready for trial trips. They've been yelling to high heaven that we were\nbuilding a space fleet to conquer the world. We weren't. They were. And\nit looks very much as if they may have beaten us.\"\n\nThe lieutenant got out the dreary mass of papers, intended to call for\nevery conscious or unconscious observation Joe might have made in space.\nIt was the equivalent of the interviews extracted from fliers after a\nbombing raid, and it was necessary, but Joe was very tired.\n\nWearily, he said, \"Start your questions. I'll try to answer them.\"\n\nThey arrived in Bootstrap some forty-six hours after the crashing of\ntheir ship. Joe, at least, had slept nearly thirty of those hours. So\nwhile he was still wobbly on his feet and would be for days to come,\nhis disposition was vastly improved.\n\nThere was nobody waiting on the airfield by the town of Bootstrap, but\nas they landed a black car came smoothly out and stopped close by the\ntransport. Joe got down and climbed into it. Sally Holt was inside. She\ntook both his hands and cried, and he was horribly embarrassed when the\nChief came blundering into the car after him. But the Chief growled, \"If\nhe didn't kiss you, Sally, I'm going to kick his pants for him.\"\n\n\"He--he did,\" said Sally, gulping. \"And I'm glad you're back, Chief. And\nHaney. And Mike.\"\n\nMike grinned as he climbed in the back too. Haney crowded in after him.\nThey filled the rear of the car entirely. It started off swiftly across\nthe field, swerving to the roadway that led to the highway out of\nBootstrap to the Shed. It sped out that long white concrete ribbon, and\nthe desert was abruptly all around them. Far ahead, the great round\nhalf-dome of the Shed looked like a cherry-pit on the horizon.\n\n\"It's good to be back!\" said the Chief warmly. \"I feel like I weigh a\nton, but it's good to be back! Mike's the only one who was happier out\nyonder. He figures he belongs there. I got a story to tell you,\nSally----\"\n\n\"Chief!\" said Mike fiercely. \"Shut up!\"\n\n\"Won't,\" said the Chief amiably. \"Sally, this guy Mike----\"\n\nMike went pale. \"You're too big to kill,\" he said bitterly, \"but I'll\ntry it!\"\n\nThe Chief grunted at him. \"Quit being modest. Sally----\"\n\nMike flung himself at the Chief, literally snarling. His small fist hit\nthe Chief's face--and Mike was small but he was not puny. The \"crack\" of\nthe impact was loud in the car. Haney grabbed. There was a moment's\nfrenzied struggling. Then Mike was helplessly wrapped in Haney's arms,\nincoherent with fury and shame.\n\n\"Crazy fool!\" grunted the Chief, feeling his jaw. \"What's the matter\nwith you? Don't you feel good?\"\n\nHe was angry, but he was more concerned. Mike was white and raging.\n\n\"You tell that,\" he panted shrilly, \"and so help me----\"\n\n\"What's got into you?\" demanded Haney anxiously. \"I'd be bragging, I\nwould, if I'd got a brainstorm like you did! That guy Sanford woulda\nwiped us all out----\"\n\nThe Chief said angrily, between unease and puzzlement:\n\n\"I never knew you to go off your nut like this before! What's got into\nyou, anyway?\"\n\nMike gulped suddenly. Haney still held him firmly, but both Haney and\nthe Chief were looking at him with worried eyes. And Mike said\ndesperately: \"You were going to tell Sally----\"\n\nThe Chief snorted.\n\n\"Huh! You fool little runt! No! I was going to tell her about you\nopening up that airlock when Sanford locked us out! Sure I kidded you\nabout what you're talking about! Sure! I'm going to do it again! But\nthat's amongst us! I don't tell that outside!\"\n\nHaney made an inarticulate exclamation. He understood, and he was\nrelieved. But he looked disgusted. He released Mike abruptly, rumbling\nto himself. He stared out the window. And Mike stood upright, an absurd\nsmall figure. His face worked a little.\n\n\"Okay,\" said Mike, with a little difficulty. \"I was dumb. Only, Chief,\nyou owe me a sock on the jaw when you feel like it. I'll take it.\"\n\nHe swallowed. Sally was watching wide-eyed.\n\n\"Sally,\" said Mike bitterly, \"I'm a bigger fool than I look. I thought\nthe Chief was going to tell you what happened when I landed. I--I\nfloated down in a village over there in India, and those crazy savages'd\nnever seen a parachute, and they began to yell and make gestures, and\nfirst thing I knew they had a sort of litter and were piling me in it,\nand throwing flowers all over me, and there was a procession----\"\n\nSally listened blankly. Mike told the tale of his shame with the very\nquintessence of bitter resentment. When he got to his installation in a\nred-painted mud temple, and the reverent and forcible removal of his\nclothes so he could be greased with butter, Sally's lips began to\ntwitch. At the picture of Mike in a red loincloth, squirming furiously\nwhile brown-skinned admirers zestfully sang his praises, howling his\nrage while they celebrated some sort of pious festival in honor of his\narrival, Sally broke down and laughed helplessly.\n\nMike stared at her, aghast. He felt that he'd hated the Chief when he\nthought the Chief was going to tell the tale on him as a joke. He'd told\nit on himself as a penance, in the place of the blow he'd given the\nChief and which the Chief wouldn't return. To Mike it was still tragedy.\nIt was still an outrage to his dignity. But Sally was laughing. She\nrocked back and forth next to Joe, helpless with mirth.\n\n\"Oh, Mike!\" she gasped. \"It's beautiful! They must have been saying such\nlovely, respectful things, while you were calling them names and wanting\nto kill them! They'd have been bragging to each other about how you\nwere--visiting them because they'd been such good people, and--this was\nthe reward of well-spent lives, and you--you----\"\n\nShe leaned against Joe and shook. The car went on. The Chief chuckled.\nHaney grinned. Joe watched Mike as this new aspect of his disgrace got\ninto his consciousness. It hadn't occurred to Mike, before, that anybody\nbut himself had been ridiculous. It hadn't occurred to him, until he\nlost his temper, that Haney and the Chief would ride him mercilessly\namong themselves, but would not dream of letting anybody outside the\ngang do so.\n\nPresently Mike managed to grin a little. It was a twisty grin, and not\naltogether mirthful.\n\n\"Yeah,\" he said wrily. \"I see it. They were crazy too. I should've had\nmore sense than to get mad.\" Then his grin grew a trifle twistier. \"I\ndidn't tell you that the thing that made me maddest was when they wanted\nto put earrings on me. I grabbed a club then and--uh--persuaded them I\ndidn't like the idea.\"\n\nSally chortled. The picture of the small, truculent Mike in frenzied\nrevolt with a club against the idea of being decked with jewelry....\nMike turned to the two big men and shoved at them imperiously.\n\n\"Move over!\" he growled. \"If you two big lummoxes had dropped in on\nthose crazy goofs instead of me, they'd've thought you were elephants\nand set you to work hauling logs!\"\n\nHe squirmed to a seat between them. He still looked ashamed, but it was\nshame of a different sort. Now he looked as if he wished he hadn't\nmistrusted his friends for even a moment. And he included Sally.\n\n\"Anyhow,\" he said suddenly in a different tone, \"maybe it did do some\ngood for me to get all worked up! I got kind of frantic. I figured\nsomebody'd made a fool of me, and I was going to put something over on\nyou.\"\n\n\"Mike!\" said Sally reproachfully.\n\n\"Not like you think, Sally,\" said Mike, grinning a little. \"I made up my\nmind to beat these lummoxes at their own game. I asked Joe about my\nbrainstorm in the plane. He didn't know what I was driving at, but he\nsaid what I hoped was so. So I'm telling you--and,\" he added fiercely,\n\"if it's any good everybody gets credit for it, because all of us\nfour--even two big apes who try kidding--are responsible for it!\"\n\nHe glared at them. Joe asked. \"What is it, Mike?\"\n\n\"I think,\" said Mike, \"I think I've got a trick to make space ships\nquicker than anybody ever dreamed of. Joe says you can make a weld with\npowder metallurgy. And I think we can use that trick to make one-piece\nships--lighter and stronger and tighter--and fast enough to make your\nhead swim! And you guys are in on it!\"\n\nThe black car braked by the entrance to the Security offices outside the\nShed. It looked completely deserted. There was only a skeleton force\nhere since the Platform had been launched three months before. There was\nalmost nobody to be seen, but Mike pressed his lips pugnaciously\ntogether as they got out of the car and went inside.\n\nThe four of them, with Sally, went along the empty corridors to the\nmajor's office. He was waiting for them. He shook hands all around. But\nit was not possible for Major Holt to give an impression of cordiality.\n\n\"I'm very glad to see all of you back,\" he said curtly. \"It didn't look\nlike you'd make it. Joe, you will be able to reach your father by\nlong-distance telephone as soon as you finish here. I--ah--thought it\nwould not be indiscreet to tell him you had landed safely, though I did\nask him to keep the fact to himself.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said Joe.\n\n\"You answered most of the questions you needed to answer on the plane,\"\nadded the major, grimly, \"and now you may want to ask some. You know\nthere is no ship for you. You know that the enemies of the Platform\ncopied our rocket fuel. You know they've made rockets with it. You've\nmet them! And Intelligence says they're building a fleet of space\nships--not for space exploration, but simply to smash the Platform and\nget set for an ultimatum to the United States to backwater or be\nbombarded from space.\"\n\nMike said crisply: \"How long before they can do it?\"\n\nMajor Holt turned uncordial eyes upon him. \"It's anybody's guess. Why?\"\n\n\"We've been working something out,\" said Mike, firmly but in part\nuntruthfully. He stood sturdily before the major's desk, which he barely\ntopped. \"The four of us have been working it out. Joe says they've done\npowder metallurgy welds, back at his father's plant. Joe and Haney and\nthe Chief and me, we've been working out an idea.\"\n\nMajor Holt waited. His hands moved nervously on his desk. Joe looked at\nMike. Haney and the Chief regarded him warily. The Chief cocked his head\non one side.\n\n\"It'll take a minute to get it across,\" said Mike. \"You have to think of\nconcrete first. When you want to make a cubic yard of concrete, you take\na cubic yard of gravel. Then you add some sand--just enough to fill in\nthe cracks between the gravel. Then you put in some cement. It goes in\nthe cracks between the grains of sand. A little bit of cement makes a\nlot of concrete. See?\"\n\nMajor Holt frowned. But he knew these four. \"I see, but I don't\nunderstand.\"\n\n\"You can weld metals together with powder-metallurgy powder at less than\nred heat. You can take steel filings for sand and steel turnings for\ngravel and powdered steel for cement--\"\n\nJoe jolted erect. He looked startledly at Haney and the Chief. And\nHaney's mouth was dropping open. A great, dreamy light seemed to be\nbursting upon him. The Chief regarded Mike with very bright eyes. And\nMike sturdily, forcefully, coldly, made a sort of speech in his small\nand brittle voice.\n\nThings could be made of solid steel, he said sharply, without rolling or\nmilling or die-casting the metal, and without riveting or arc-welding\nthe parts together. The trick was powder metallurgy. Very finely\npowdered metal, packed tightly and heated to a relatively low\ntemperature--\"sintered\" is the word--becomes a solid mass. Even alloys\ncan be made by mixing powdered metals. The process had been used only\nfor small objects, but--there was the analogy to concrete. A very little\npowder could weld much metal, in the form of turnings and smaller bits.\nAnd the result would be solid steel!\n\nThen Mike grew impassioned. There was a wooden mockup of a space ship in\nthe Shed, he said. It was an absolutely accurate replica, in wood, of\nthe ships that had been destroyed. But one could take castings of it,\nand use them for molds, and fill them with powder and filings and\nturnings, and heat them not even red-hot and there would be steel hulls\nin one piece. Solid steel hulls! Needing no riveting nor anything\nelse--and one could do it fast! While the first hull was fitting out a\nsecond could be molded----\n\nThe Chief roared: \"You fool little runt!\" he bellowed. \"Tryin' to give\nus credit for that! You got more sense than any of us! You worked that\nout in your own head----\"\n\nHaney rubbed his hands together. He said softly, \"I like that! I do like\nthat!\"\n\nMajor Holt turned his eyes to Joe. \"What's your opinion?\"\n\n\"I think it's the sort of thing, sir, that a professional engineer would\nsay was a good idea but not practical. He'd mean it would be a lot of\ntrouble to get working. But I'd like to ask my father. They have done\npowder welding at the plant back home, sir.\"\n\nMajor Holt nodded. \"Call your father. If it looks promising, I'll pull\nwhat wires I can.\"\n\nJoe went out, with the others. Mike was sweating. All unconsciously, he\ntwisted his hands one within the other. He had had many humiliations\nbecause he was small, but lately he had humiliated himself by not\nbelieving in his friends. Now he needed desperately to do something that\nwould reflect credit on them as well as himself.\n\nJoe made the phone call. As he closed the door of the booth, he heard\nthe Chief kidding Mike blandly.\n\n\"Hey, Einstein,\" said the Chief. \"How about putting that brain of yours\nto work on a faster-than-light drive?\"\n\nBut then he began to struggle with the long distance operator. It took\nminutes to get the plant, and then it took time to get to the point,\nbecause his father insisted on asking anxiously how he was and if he was\nhurt in any way. Personal stuff. But Joe finally managed to explain that\nthis call dealt with the desperate need to do something about a space\nfleet.\n\nHis father said grimly, \"Yes. The situation doesn't look too good right\nnow, Joe.\"\n\n\"Try this on for size, sir,\" said Joe. He outlined Mike's scheme. His\nfather interrupted only to ask crisp questions about the mockup of the\ntender, already in existence though made of wood. Then he said, \"Go on,\nson!\"\n\nJoe finished. He heard his father speaking to someone away from the\nphone. Questions and answers, and then orders. His father spoke to him\ndirect.\n\n\"It looks promising, Joe,\" said his father. \"Right here at the plant\nwe've got the gang that can do it if anybody can. I'm getting a plane\nand coming out there, fast! Get Major Holt to clear things for me. This\nis no time for red tape! If he has trouble, I'll pull some wires\nmyself!\"\n\n\"Then I can tell Mike it's good stuff?\"\n\n\"It's not good stuff,\" said his father. \"There are about forty-seven\nthings wrong with it at first glance, but I know how to take care of one\nor two, and we'll lick the rest. You tell your friend Mike I want to\nshake him by the hand. I hope to do it tonight!\"\n\nHe hung up, and Joe went out of the phone booth. Mike looked at him\nwith yearning eyes. Joe lied a little, because Mike rated it.\n\n\"My father's on the way here to help make it work,\" he told Mike. Then\nhe added untruthfully: \"He said he thought he knew all the big men in\nhis line, and where've you been that he hasn't heard of you?\"\n\nHe turned away as the Chief whooped with glee. He hurried back to Major\nHolt as the Chief and Haney began zestfully to manhandle Mike in\ncelebration of his genius.\n\nThe major held up his hand as Joe entered. He was using the desk phone.\nJoe waited. When he hung up, Joe reported. The major seemed unsurprised.\n\n\"Yes, I had Washington on the wire,\" he said detachedly. \"I talked to a\npersonal friend who's a three-star general. There will be action started\nat the Pentagon. When you came in I was arranging with the largest\nproducers of powder-metallurgy products in the country to send their\nbest men here by plane. They will start at once. Now I have to get in\ntouch with some other people.\"\n\nJoe gaped at him. The major moved impatiently, waiting for Joe to leave.\nJoe gulped. \"Excuse me, sir, but--my father didn't say it was certain.\nHe just thinks it can be made to work. He's not sure.\"\n\n\"I didn't even wait for that, something has to turn up to take care of\nthis situation!\" said the Major with asperity. \"It has to! This\nparticular scheme may not work, but if it doesn't, something will come\nout of the work on it! You should look at a twenty-five cent piece\noccasionally, Joe!\"\n\nHe moved impatiently, and Joe went out. Sally was smiling in the outer\noffice. There were whoopings in the corridor beyond. The Chief and Haney\nwere celebrating Mike's brainstorm with salutary indignity, because if\nthey didn't make a joke of it he might cry with joy.\n\n\"Things look better?\"\n\n\"They do,\" said Joe. \"If it only works....\"\n\nThen he hunted in his pocket. He found a quarter and examined it\ncuriously. On one side he found nothing the major could have referred\nto. On the other side, though, just by George Washington's chin----\n\nHe put the quarter away and took Sally's arm.\n\n\"It'll be all right,\" he said slowly.\n\nBut there were times when it seemed in doubt. Joe's father arrived by\nplane at sunset of that same day, and he and three men from the Kenmore\nPrecision Tool Company instantly closeted themselves with Mike in Major\nHolt's quarters. The powder metallurgy men turned up an hour later, and\na three-star general from Washington. They joined the highly technical\ndiscussion.\n\nJoe waited around outside, feeling left out of things. He sat on the\nporch with Sally while the moon rose over the desert and stars shone\ndown. Inside, matters of high importance were being battled over with\nthe informality and heat with which practical men get things settled.\nBut Joe wasn't in on it. He said annoyedly, \"You'd think my father'd\nhave something to say to me, in all this mess! After all, I have\nbeen--well, I have been places! But all he said was, 'How are you, Son?\nWhere's this Mike you talked about?'\"\n\nSally said calmly, \"I know just how you feel. You've made me feel that\nway.\" She looked up at the moon. \"I thought about you all the time you\nwere gone, and I--prayed for you, Joe. And now you're back and not even\nbusy! But you don't---- It would be nice for you to think about me for a\nwhile!\"\n\n\"I am thinking about you!\" said Joe indignantly.\n\n\"Now what,\" said Sally interestedly, \"in the world could you be thinking\nabout me?\"\n\nHe wanted to scowl at her. But he grinned instead.\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nTime passed. Hours, then days. Things began to happen. Trucks appeared,\nloaded down with sacks of white powder. The powder was very messily\nmixed with water and smeared lavishly over the now waterproofed wooden\nmockup of a space ship. It came off again in sections of white plaster,\nwhich were numbered and set to dry in warm chambers that were\nconstructed with almost magical speed. More trucks arrived, bearing such\ndiverse objects as loads of steel turnings, a regenerative\nhelium-cooling plant from a gaswell--it could cool metal down to the\npoint where it crumbled to impalpable powder at a blow--and assorted\nfuel tanks, dynamos, and electronic machinery.\n\nTen days after Mike's first proposal of concreted steel as a material\nfor space ship construction, the parts of the first casting of the\nmockup were assembled. They were a mold for the hull of a space ship.\nThere were more plaster sections for a second mold ready to be dried out\nnow, but meanwhile vehicles like concrete mixers mixed turnings and\nfilings and powder in vast quantities and poured the dry mass here and\nthere in the first completed mold. Then men began to wrap the gigantic\nobject with iron wire. Presently that iron wire glowed slightly, and the\nwhole huge mold grew hotter and hotter and hotter. And after a time it\nwas allowed to cool.\n\nBut that did not mean a ceasing of activity. The plaster casts had been\nmade while the concreting process was worked out. The concreting\nprocess--including the heating--was in action while fittings were being\nflown to the Shed. But other hulls were being formed by metal-concrete\nformation even before the first mold was taken down.\n\nWhen the plaster sections came off, there was a long, gleaming,\nfrosty-sheened metal hull waiting for the fittings. It was a replacement\nof one of the two shot-down space craft, ready for fitting out some six\nweeks ahead of schedule. Next day there was a second metal hull, still\ntoo hot to touch. The day after that there was another.\n\nThen they began to be turned out at the rate of two a day, and all the\nvast expanse of the Shed resounded with the work on them. Drills drilled\nand torches burned and hammers hammered. Small diesels rumbled. Disk\nsaws cut metal like butter by the seemingly impractical method of\nspinning at 20,000 revolutions per minute. Convoys of motor busses\nrolled out from Bootstrap at change-shift time, and there were again\nSecurity men at every doorway, moving continually about.\n\nBut it still didn't look too good. There is apparently no way to beat\narithmetic, and a definitely grim problem still remained. Ten days after\nthe beginning of the new construction program, Joe and Sally looked down\nfrom a gallery high up in the outward-curving wall of the Shed. Acres of\ndark flooring lay beneath them. There was a spiral ramp that wound round\nand round between the twin skins of the fifty-story-high dome. It led\nfinally to the Communications Room at the very top of the Shed itself.\n\nWhere Joe and Sally looked down, the floor was 300 feet below. Welding\narcs glittered. Rivet guns chattered. Trucks came in the doorways with\nmaterials, and there was already a gleaming row of eighty-foot hulls.\nThere were eleven of them already uncovered, and small trucks ran up to\ntheir sides to feed the fitting-out crews such items as air tanks and\ngyro assemblies and steering rocket piping and motors, and short wave\ncommunicators and control boards. Exit doors were being fitted. The last\ntwo hulls to be uncovered were being inspected with portable x-ray\noutfits, in search of flaws. And there were still other ungainly white\nmolds, which were other hulls in process of formation--the metal still\npouring into the molds in powder form, or being tamped down, or being\nsintered to solidity.\n\nJoe leaned on the gallery-railing and said unhappily, \"I can't help\nworrying, even though the Platform hasn't been shot at since we landed.\"\n\nThat wasn't an expression of what he was thinking. He was thinking about\nmatters the enemies of the Platform would have liked to know about.\nSally knew these matters too. But top secret information isn't talked\nabout by the people who know it, unless they are actively at work on it.\nAt all other times one pretends even to himself that he doesn't know it.\nThat is the only possible way to avoid leaks.\n\nThe top secret information was simply that it was still impossible to\nsupply the Platform. Ships could be made faster than had ever been\ndreamed of before, but so long as any ship that went up could be\ndestroyed on the way down, the supply of the Platform was impractical.\nBut the ships were being built regardless, against the time when a way\nto get them down again was thought of. As of the moment it hadn't been\nthought of yet.\n\nBut building the ships anyhow was unconscious genius, because nobody but\nAmericans could imagine anything so foolish. The enemies of the Platform\nand of the United States knew that full-scale production of ships by\nsome fantastic new method was in progress. The fact couldn't be hidden.\nBut nobody in a country where material shortages were chronic could\nimagine building ships before a way to use them was known. So the\nPlatform's enemies were convinced that the United States had something\nwholly new and very remarkable, and threatened their spies with\nunspeakable fates if they didn't find out what it was.\n\nThey didn't find out. The rulers of the enemy nations knew, of course,\nthat if a new--say--space-drive had been invented, they would very soon\nhave to change their tune. So there were no more attacks on the\nPlatform. It floated serenely overhead, sending down astronomical\nobservations and solar-constant measurements and weather maps, while\nabout it floated a screen of garbage and discarded tin cans.\n\nBut Joe and Sally looked down where the ships were being built while the\nproblem of how to use them was debated.\n\n\"It's a tough nut to crack,\" said Joe dourly.\n\nIt haunted him. Ships going up had to have crews. Crews had to come down\nagain because they had to leave supplies at the Platform, not consume\nthem there. Getting a ship up to orbit was easier than getting it down\nagain.\n\n\"The Navy's been working on light guided missiles,\" said Sally.\n\n\"No good,\" snapped Joe.\n\nIt wasn't. He'd been asked for advice. Could a space ship crew control\nguided missiles and fight its way back to ground with them? The answer\nwas that it could. But guided missiles used to fight one's way down\nwould have to be carried up first. And they would weigh as much as all\nthe cargo a ship could carry. A ship that carried fighting rockets\ncouldn't carry cargo. Cargo at the Platform was the thing desired.\n\n\"All that's needed,\" said Sally, watching Joe's face, \"is a slight touch\nof genius. There's been genius before now. Burning your cabin free with\nlanding-rocket flames----\"\n\n\"Haney's idea,\" growled Joe dispiritedly.\n\n\"And making more ships in a hurry with metal-concrete----\"\n\n\"Mike did that,\" said Joe ruefully.\n\n\"But you made the garbage-screen for the Platform,\" insisted Sally.\n\n\"Sanford had made a wisecrack,\" said Joe. \"And it just happened that it\nmade sense that he hadn't noticed.\" He grimaced. \"You say something like\nthat, now....\"\n\nSally looked at him with soft eyes. It wasn't really his job, this\nworrying. The top-level brains of the armed forces were struggling with\nit. They were trying everything from redesigned rocket motors to really\nradical notions. But there wasn't anything promising yet.\n\n\"What's really needed,\" said Sally regretfully, \"is a way for ships to\ngo up to the Platform and not have to come back.\"\n\n\"Sure!\" said Joe ironically. Then he said, \"Let's go down!\"\n\nThey started down the long, winding ramp which led between the two skins\nof the Shed's wall. It was quite empty, this long, curving, descending\ncorridor. It was remarkably private. In a place like the Shed, with\nfrantic activity going on all around, and even at Major Holt's quarters\nwhere Sally lived and Joe was a guest, there wasn't often a chance for\nthem to talk in any sort of actual privacy.\n\nBut Joe went on, scowling. Sally went with him. If she seemed to hang\nback a little at first, he didn't notice. Presently she shrugged her\nshoulders and ceased to try to make him notice that nobody else happened\nto be around. They made a complete circuit of the Shed within its wall,\nJoe staring ahead without words.\n\nThen he stopped abruptly. His expression was unbelieving. Sally almost\nbumped into him.\n\n\"What's the matter?\"\n\n\"You had it, Sally!\" he said amazedly. \"You did it! You said it!\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"The touch of genius!\" He almost babbled. \"Ships that can go up to the\nPlatform and not have to come back! Sally, you did it! You did it!\"\n\nShe regarded him helplessly. He took her by the shoulders as if to shake\nher into comprehension. But he kissed her exuberantly instead.\n\n\"Come on!\" he said urgently. \"I've got to tell the gang!\"\n\nHe grabbed her hand and set off at a run for the bottom of the ramp. And\nSally, with remarkably mingled emotions showing on her face, was dragged\nin his wake.\n\nHe was still pulling her after him when he found the Chief and Haney and\nMike in the room at Security where they were practically self-confined,\nlest their return to Earth become too publicly known. Mike was stalking\nup and down with his hands clasped behind his back, glum as a miniature\nNapoleon and talking bitterly. The Chief was sprawled in a chair. Haney\nsat upright regarding his knuckles with a thoughtful air.\n\nJoe stepped inside the door. Mike continued without a pause: \"I tell\nyou, if they'll only use little guys like me, the cabin and supplies and\ncrew can be cut down by tons! Even the instruments can be smaller and\nweigh less! Four of us in a smaller cabin, less grub and air and\nwater--we'll save tons in cabin-weight alone! Why can't you big lummoxes\nsee it?\"\n\n\"We see it, Mike,\" Haney said mildly. \"You're right. But people won't do\nit. It's not fair, but they won't.\"\n\nJoe said, beaming, \"Besides, Mike, it'd bust up our gang! And Sally's\njust gotten the real answer! The answer is for ships to go up to the\nPlatform and not come back!\"\n\nHe grinned at them. The Chief raised his eyebrows. Haney turned his head\nto stare. Joe said exuberantly: \"They've been talking about arming ships\nwith guided missiles to fight with. Too heavy, of course. But--if we\ncould handle guided missiles, why couldn't we handle drones?\"\n\nThe three of them gaped at him. Sally said, startled, \"But--but, Joe, I\ndidn't----\"\n\n\"We've got plenty of hulls!\" said Joe. Somehow he still looked\nastonished at what he'd made of Sally's perfectly obvious comment.\n\"Mike's arranged for that! Make--say--six of 'em into drones--space\nbarges. Remote-controlled ships. Control them from one manned ship--the\ntug! We'll ride that! Take 'em up to the Platform exactly like a tug\ntows barges. The tow-line will be radio beams. We'll have a space-tow\nup, and not bother to bring the barges back! There won't be any landing\nrockets! They'll carry double cargo! That's the answer! A space tug\nhauling a tow to the Platform!\"\n\n\"But, Joe,\" insisted Sally, \"I didn't think of----\"\n\nThe Chief heaved himself up. Haney's voice cut through what the Chief\nwas about to say. Haney said drily: \"Sally, if Joe hadn't kissed you for\nthinking that up, I would. Makes me feel mighty dumb.\"\n\nMike swallowed. Then he said loyally, \"Yeah. Me too. I'd've made a\ntwo-ton cargo possible--maybe. But this adds up. What does the major\nsay?\"\n\n\"I--haven't talked to him. I'd better, right away.\" Joe grinned. \"I\nwanted to tell you first.\"\n\nThe Chief grunted. \"Good idea. But hold everything!\" He fumbled in his\npocket. \"The arithmetic is easy enough, Joe. Cut out the crew and air\nand you save something.\" He felt in another pocket. \"Leave off the\nlanding rockets, and you save plenty more. Count in the cargo you could\ntake anyhow\"---- he searched another pocket still----\"and you get\nforty-two tons of cargo per space barge, delivered at the Platform. Six\ndrones--that's 252 tons in one tow! Here!\" He'd found what he wanted. It\nwas a handkerchief. He thrust it upon Joe. \"Wipe that lipstick off, Joe,\nbefore you go talk to the major. He's Sally's father and he might not\nlike it.\"\n\nJoe wiped at his face. Sally, her eyes shining, took the handkerchief\nfrom him and finished the job. She displayed that remarkable\ninsensitivity of females in situations productive of both pride and\nembarrassment. When a girl or a woman is proud, she is never\nembarrassed.\n\nShe and Joe went away, and Sally rushed right into her father's office.\nIn fifteen minutes technical men began to arrive for conferences,\nsummoned by telephone. Within forty-five minutes, messengers carried\norders out to the Shed floor and stopped the installation of certain\ntypes of fittings in all but one of the hulls. In an hour and a half,\ntop technical designers were doing the work of foremen and getting\nthings done without benefit of blueprints. The proposal was beautifully\nsimple to put into practice. Guided-missile control systems were already\nin mass production. They could simply be adjusted to take care of\ndrones.\n\nWithin twelve hours there were truck-loads of new sorts of supplies\narriving at the Shed. Some were Air Force supplies and some were\nOrdnance, and some were strictly Quartermaster. These were not component\nparts of space ships. They were freight for the Platform.\n\nAnd, just forty-eight hours after Joe and Sally looked dispiritedly down\nupon the floor of the Shed, there were seven gleaming hulls in launching\ncages and the unholy din of landing pushpots outside the Shed. They came\nwith hysterical cries from their airfield to the south, and they flopped\nflat with extravagant crashings on the desert outside the eastern door.\n\nBy the time the pushpots had been hauled in, one by one, and had\nattached themselves to the launching cages, Joe and Haney and the Chief\nand Mike had climbed into the cabin of the one ship which was not a\ndrone. There were now seven cages in all to be hoisted toward the sky. A\ngreat double triangular gore had been jacked out and rolled aside to\nmake an exit in the side of the Shed. Nearly as many pushpots, it\nseemed, were involved in this launching as in the take-off of the\nPlatform itself.\n\nThe routine test before take-off set the pushpot motors to roaring\ninside the Shed. The noise was the most sustained and ghastly tumult\nthat had been heard on Earth since the departure of the Platform.\n\nBut this launching was not so impressive. It was definitely untidy,\nimprecise, and unmilitary. There were seven eighty-foot hulls in cages\nsurrounded by clustering, bellowing, preposterous groups of howling\nobjects that looked like over-sized black beetles. One of the seven\nhulls had eyes. The others were blind--but they were equipped with radio\nantennae. The ship with eyes had several small basket-type radar bowls\nprojecting from its cabin plating.\n\nThe seven objects rose one by one and went bellowing and blundering out\nto the open air. At 40 and 50 feet above the ground, they jockeyed into\nsome sort of formation, with much wallowing and pitching and clumsy\nmaneuvering.\n\nThen, without preliminary, they started up. They rose swiftly. The noise\nof their going diminished from a bellow to a howl, and from a howl to a\nmoaning noise, and then to a faint, faint, ever-dwindling hum.\n\nPresently that faded out, too.\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nAll the sensations were familiar, the small fleet of improbable objects\nrose and rose. Of all flying objects ever imagined by man, the launching\ncages supported by pushpots were most irrational.\n\nThe squadron, though, went bumbling upward. In the manned ship, Joe was\nmore tense than on his other take-off--if such a thing was possible. His\nwork was harder this trip. Before, he'd had Mike at communications and\nthe Chief at the steering rockets while Haney kept the pushpots balanced\nfor thrust. Now Joe flew the manned ship alone. Headphones and a mike\ngave him communications with the Shed direct, and the pushpots were\nbalanced in groups, which cost efficiency but helped on control. He\nwould have, moreover, to handle his own steering rockets during\nacceleration and when he could--and dared--he should supervise the\nothers. Because each of the other three had two drone-ships to guide.\nTrue, they had only to keep their drones in formation, but Joe had to\nnavigate for all. The four of them had been assigned this flight because\nof its importance. They happened to be the only crew alive who had ever\nflown a space ship designed for maneuvering, and their experience\nconsisted of a single trip.\n\nThe jet stream was higher this time than on that other journey now two\nmonths past. They blundered into it at 36,000 feet. Joe's headphones\nbuzzed tinnily. Radar from the ground told him his rate-of-rise, his\nground speed, his orbital speed, and added comments on the handling of\nthe drones.\n\nThe last was not a precision job. On the way up Joe protested,\n\"Somebody's ship--Number Four--is lagging! Snap it up!\"\n\nMike said crisply, \"Got it, Joe. Coming up!\"\n\n\"The Shed says three separate ships are getting out of formation. And we\nneed due east pointing. Check it.\"\n\nThe Chief muttered, \"Something whacky here ... come round, you! Okay,\nJoe.\"\n\nJoe had no time for reflection. He was in charge of the clumsiest\noperation ever designed for an exact result. The squadron went wallowing\ntoward the sky. The noise was horrible. A tinny voice in his headphones:\n\n\"_You are at 65,000 feet. Your rate-of-climb curve is flattening. You\nshould fire your jatos when practical. You have some leeway in rocket\npower._\"\n\nJoe spoke into the extraordinary maze of noise waves and pressure\nsystems in the air of the cabin.\n\n\"We should blast. I'm throwing in the series circuit for jatos. Try to\nline up. We want the drones above us and with a spread, remember! Go to\nit!\"\n\nHe watched his direction indicator and the small graphic indicators\ntelling of the drones. The sky outside the ports was dark purple. The\nlaunching cage responded sluggishly. Its open end came around toward the\neast. It wobbled and wavered. It touched the due-east point. Joe stabbed\nthe firing-button.\n\nNothing happened. He hadn't expected it. The seven ships had to keep in\nformation. They had to start off on one course--with a slight spread as\na safety measure--and at one time. So the firing-circuits were keyed to\nrelays in series. Only when all seven firing-keys were down at the same\ntime would any of the jatos fire. Then all would blast together.\n\nThe pilots in the cockpit-bubbles of the pushpots had an extraordinary\nview of the scene. At something over twelve miles height, seven\naggregations of clumsy black things clung to frameworks of steel,\npushing valorously. Far below there were clouds and there was Earth.\nThere was a horizon, which wavered and tilted. The pushpots struggled\nwith seeming lack of purpose. One of the seven seemed to drop below the\nothers. They pointed vaguely this way and that--all of them. But\ngradually they seemed to arrive at an uncertain unanimity.\n\nJoe pushed the firing-button again as his own ship touched the due-east\nmark. Again nothing happened. Out of the corner of his eye he saw Haney\npressing down both buttons. The Chief's finger lifted. Mike pushed down\none button and held off the other.\n\nRoarings and howlings of pushpots. Wobblings and heart-breaking\nclumsinesses of the drone-ships. They hung in the sky while the pushpots\nused up their fuel.\n\n\"We've got to make it soon,\" said Joe grimly. \"We've got forty seconds.\nOr we'll have to go down and try again.\"\n\nThere was a clock dial with a red sweep-hand which moved steadily and\nominously toward a deadline time for firing. Up to that deadline, the\npushpots could let the ships back down to Earth without crashing them.\nAfter it, they'd run out of fuel before a landing could be made.\n\nThe deadline came closer and closer. Joe snapped:\n\n\"Take a degree leeway. We've got ten seconds.\"\n\nHe had the manned ship nearly steady. He held down the firing-button,\nholding aim by infinitesimal movements of the controls. Haney pushed\nboth hands down, raised one, pushed again. The Chief had one finger\ndown. Mike had both firing buttons depressed.... The Chief pushed down\nhis second button, quietly.\n\nThere was a monstrous impact. Every jato in every pushpot about every\nlaunching cage fired at once. Joe felt himself flung back into his\nacceleration chair. Six gravities. He began the horrible fight to stay\nalive, while the blood tried to drain from the conscious forepart of his\nbrain, and while every button of his garments pressed noticeably against\nhim, and objects in his pockets pushed. The sides of his mouth dragged\nback, and his cheeks sagged, and his tongue strove to sink back into his\nthroat and strangle him.\n\nIt was very bad. It seemed to last for centuries.\n\nThen the jatos burned out. There was that ghastly feeling of lunging\nforward to weightlessness. One instant, Joe's body weighed half a ton.\nThe next instant, it weighed less than a dust grain. His head throbbed\ntwice as if his skull were about to split open and let his brains run\nout. But these things he had experienced before.\n\nThere were pantings in the cabin about him. The ship fell. It happened\nto be going up, but the sensation and the fact was free fall. Joe had\nbeen through this before, too. He gasped for breath and croaked,\n\"Drones?\"\n\n\"Right,\" said Haney.\n\nMike panted anxiously, \"Four's off course. I'll fix it.\"\n\nThe Chief grunted guttural Mohawk. His hands stirred on the panel for\nremote control of the drones he had to handle.\n\n\"Crazy!\" he growled. \"Got it now, Joe. Fire when ready.\"\n\n\"Okay, Mike?\"\n\nA half-second pause.\n\n\"Okay!\"\n\nJoe pressed the firing-button for the take-off rockets. And he was\nslammed back into his acceleration chair again. But this was three\ngravities only. Pressed heavily against the acceleration cushions, he\ncould perform the navigation for the fleet. He did. The mother-ship had\nto steer a true course, regardless of the vagaries of its rockets. The\ndrones had simply to be kept in formation with it. The second task was\nsimpler. But Joe was relieved, this time, of the need to report back\ninstrument-readings. A telemetering device took care of that.\n\nThe take-off rockets blasted and blasted and blasted. The mere matter of\nstaying alive grew very tedious. The ordeal seemed to last for\ncenturies. Actually it could be measured only in minutes. But it seemed\nmillennia before the headphones said, staccato fashion: \"_You are on\ncourse and will reach speed in fourteen seconds. I will count for you._\"\n\n\"Relays for rocket release,\" panted Joe. \"Throw 'em over!\"\n\nThree hands moved to obey. Joe could release the drive rockets on all\nseven ships at will.\n\nThe voice counted:\n\n\"_Ten ... nine ... eight ... seven ... six ... five ... four ... three\n... two ... one ... cut!_\"\n\nJoe pressed the master-key. The remnants of the solid-fuel take-off\nrockets let go. They flashed off into nothingness at unbelievable speed,\nconsuming themselves as they went.\n\nThere was again no weight.\n\nThis time there was no resting. No eager gazing out the cabin ports. Now\nthey weren't curious. They'd had over a month in space, and something\nlike sixteen days back on Earth, and now they were back in space again.\n\nMike and Haney and the Chief worked doggedly at their control boards.\nThe radar bowls outside the cabin shifted and moved and quivered. The\nsix drone ships showed on the screens. But they also had telemetering\napparatus. They faithfully reported their condition and the direction in\nwhich their bows pointed. The radars plotted their position with\nrelation to each other and the mother-ship.\n\nPresently Joe cast a glance out of a port and saw that the dark line of\nsunset was almost below. The take-off had been timed to get the ships\ninto Earth's shadow above the area from which war rockets were most\nlikely to rise. It wouldn't prevent bombing, of course. But there was a\ngadget....\n\nJoe spoke into the microphone: \"Reporting everything all right so far.\nBut you know it.\"\n\nThe voice from solid ground said, \"_Report acknowledged._\"\n\nThe ships went on and on and on. The Chief muttered to himself and made\nvery minute adjustments of the movement of one of his drones. Mike\nfussed with his. Haney regarded the controls of his drones with a\nprofound calm.\n\nNothing happened, except that they seemed to be falling into a\nbottomless pit and their stomach-muscles knotted and cramped in purely\nreflex response to the sensation. Even that grew tedious.\n\nThe headphones said, \"_You will enter Earth's shadow in three minutes.\nPrepare for combat._\"\n\nJoe said drily, \"We're to prepare for combat.\"\n\nThe Chief growled. \"I'd like to do just that!\"\n\nThe phrasing, of course, was intentional--in case enemy ears were\nlistening. Actually, the small fleet was to use a variant on the tin can\nshield which protected the Platform. It would be most effective if\nvisual observation was impossible. The fleet was seven ships in very\nragged formation. Most improbably, after the long three-gravity\nacceleration, they were still within a fifty-mile globe of space. Number\nFour loitered behind, but was being brought up by judicious bursts of\nsteering-rocket fire. Number Two was some distance ahead. The others\nwere simply scattered. They went floating on like a group of meteors.\nOut the ports, two of them were visible. The others might be picked out\nby the naked eye--but it wasn't likely.\n\nDrone Two, far ahead and clearly visible, turned from a shining steel\nspeck to a reddish pin-point of light. The red color deepened. It winked\nout. The sunlight in the ports of the mother-ship turned red. Then it\nblacked out.\n\n\"Shoot the ghosts,\" said Joe.\n\nThe three drone-handlers pushed their buttons. Nothing happened that\nanybody could see. Actually, though, a small gadget outside the hull\nbegan to cough rhythmically. Similar devices on the drones coughed, too.\nThey were small, multiple-barreled guns. Rifle shells fired two-pound\nmissiles at random targets in emptiness. They wouldn't damage anything\nthey hit. They'd go varying distances, explode and shoot small lead shot\nahead to check their missile-velocity, and then emit dense masses of\naluminum foil. There was no air resistance. The shredded foil would\ncontinue to move through emptiness at the same rate as the convoy-fleet.\nThe seven ships had fired a total of eighty-four such objects away into\nthe blackness of Earth's shadow. There were, then, seven ships and\neighty-four masses of aluminum foil moving through emptiness. They\ncould not be seen by telescopes.\n\nAnd radars could not tell ships from masses of aluminum foil.\n\nIf enemy radars came probing upward, they reported ninety-one space\nships in ragged but coherent formation, soaring through emptiness toward\nthe Platform. And a fleet like that was too strong to attack.\n\nThe radar operators had been prepared to forward details of the speed\nand course of a single ship to waiting rocket-launching submarines\nhalf-way across the Pacific. But they reported to Very High Authority\ninstead.\n\nHe received the report of an armada--an incredible fleet--in space. He\ndidn't believe it. But he didn't dare disbelieve it.\n\nSo the fleet swam peacefully through the darkness that was Earth's\nshadow, and no attempt at attack was made. They came out into sunlight\nto look down at the western shore of America itself. With seven ships to\nget on an exact course, at an exact speed, at an exact moment, time was\nneeded. So the fleet made almost a complete circuit of the Earth before\nreaching the height of the Platform's orbit.\n\nThey joined it. A single man in a space suit, anchored to its outer\nplates, directed a plastic hose which stretched out impossibly far and\nclamped to one drone with a magnetic grapple. He maneuvered it to the\nhull and made it fast. He captured a second, which was worked delicately\nwithin reach by coy puffs of steering-rocket vapor.\n\nOne by one, the drones were made fast. Then the manned ship went in the\nlock and the great outer door closed, and the plastic-fabric walls\ncollapsed behind their nets, and air came in.\n\nLieutenant Commander Brown was the one to come into the lock to greet\nthem. He shook hands all around--and it again seemed strange to all the\nfour from Earth to find themselves with their feet more or less firmly\nplanted on a solid floor, but their bodies wavering erratically to right\nand left and before and back, because there was no up or down.\n\n\"Just had reports from Earth,\" Brown told Joe comfortably. \"The news of\nyour take-off was released to avoid panic in Europe. But everybody who\ndoesn't like us is yelling blue murder. Somebody--you may guess who--is\nannouncing that a fleet of ninety-one war rockets took off from the\nUnited States and now hangs poised in space while the decadent American\nwar-mongers prepare an ultimatum to all the world. Everybody's\nfrightened.\"\n\n\"If they'll only stay scared until we get unloaded,\" said Joe in some\nsatisfaction, \"the government back home can tell them how many we were\nand what we came up for. But we'll probably make out all right, anyhow.\"\n\n\"My crew will unload,\" said Brown, in conscious thoughtfulness. \"You\nmust have gotten pretty well exhausted by that acceleration.\"\n\nJoe shook his head. \"I think we can handle the freight faster. We found\nout a few things by going back to Earth.\"\n\nA section of plating at the top of the lock--at least it had been the\ntop when the Platform was built on Earth--opened up as on the first\njourney here. A face grinned down. But from this point on, the procedure\nwas changed. Haney and Joe went into the cargo-section of the rocketship\nand heaved its contents smoothly through weightlessness to the storage\nchamber above. The Chief and Mike stowed it there. The speed and\nprecision of their work was out of all reason. Brown stared\nincredulously.\n\nThe fact was simply that on their first trip to the Platform, Joe and\nhis crew didn't know how to use their strength where there was no\nweight. By the time they'd learned, their muscles had lost all tone. Now\nthey were fresh from Earth, with Earth-strength muscles--and they knew\nhow to use them.\n\n\"When we got back,\" Joe told Brown, \"we were practically invalids. No\nexercise up here. This time we've brought some harness to wear. We've\nsome for you, too.\"\n\nThey moved out of the airlock, and the ship was maneuvered to a mooring\noutside, and a drone took its place. Brown's eyes blinked at the\nunloading of the drone. But he said, \"Navy style work, that!\"\n\n\"Out here,\" said Joe, \"you take no more exercise than an invalid on\nEarth--in fact, not as much. By now the original crew would have trouble\nstanding up on a trip back to Earth. You'd feel pretty heavy, yourself.\"\n\nBrown frowned.\n\n\"Hm. I--ah--I shall ask for instructions on the matter.\"\n\nHe stood erect. He didn't waver on his feet as the others did. But he\nwore the same magnetic-soled shoes. Joe knew, with private amusement,\nthat Brown must have worked hard to get a dignified stance in\nweightlessness.\n\n\"Mr. Kenmore,\" said Brown suddenly. \"Have you been assigned a definite\nrank as yet?\"\n\n\"Not that I know of,\" said Joe without interest. \"I skipper the ship I\njust brought up. But----\"\n\n\"Your ship has no rating!\" protested Brown irritably. \"The skipper of a\nNavy ship may be anything from a lieutenant junior grade to a captain,\ndepending on the size and rating of the ship. In certain circumstances\neven a noncommissioned officer. Are you an enlisted man?\"\n\n\"Again, not that I know of,\" Joe told him. \"Nor my crew, either.\"\n\nBrown looked at once annoyed and distressed.\n\n\"It isn't regular!\" he objected. \"It isn't shipshape! I should know\nwhether you are under my command or not! For discipline! For\norganization! It should be cleared up! I shall put through an urgent\ninquiry.\"\n\nJoe looked at him incredulously. Lieutenant Commander Brown was a\nperfectly amiable man, but he had to have things in a certain pattern\nfor him to recognize that they were in a pattern at all. He was more\nexcited over the fact that he didn't know whether he ranked Joe, than\nover the much more important matter of physical deterioration in the\nabsence of gravity. Yet he surely understood their relative importance.\nThe fact was, of course, that he could confidently expect exact\ninstructions about the last, while he had to settle matters of\ndiscipline and routine for himself.\n\n\"I shall ask for clarification of your status,\" he said worriedly. \"It\nshouldn't have been left unclear. I'd better attend to it at once.\"\n\nHe looked at Joe as if expecting a salute. He didn't get it. He clanked\naway, his magnetic shoe-soles beating out a singularly martial rhythm.\nHe must have practised that walk, in private.\n\nJoe got out of the airlock as another of the space barges was warped in.\nBrent, the crew's psychologist, joined him when he went to unload. Brent\nnodded in a friendly fashion to Joe.\n\n\"Quite a change, eh?\" he said drily. \"Sanford turned out to be a\ncrackpot with his notions of grandeur. I'm not sure that Brown's notions\nof discipline aren't worse.\"\n\nJoe said, \"I've something rather important to pass on,\" and told about\nthe newly discovered physical effects of a long stay where there was no\ngravity. The doctors now predicted that anybody who spent six months\nwithout weight would suffer a deterioration of muscle tone which could\nmake a return to Earth impossible without a long preliminary process of\nretraining. One's heart would adjust to the absence of any need to pump\nblood against gravity.\n\n\"Which,\" said Joe, \"means that you're going to have to be relieved\nbefore too long. But we brought up some gravity-simulator harness that\nmay help.\"\n\nBrent said desolately: \"And I was so pleased! We all had trouble with\ninsomnia, at first, but lately we've all been sleeping well! Now I see\nwhy! Normally one sleeps because he's tired. We had trouble sleeping\nuntil our muscles got so weak we tired anyhow!\"\n\nAnother drone came in and was unloaded. And another and another. But the\nlast of them wasn't only unloaded. Haney took over the Platform's\ncontrol board and--grinning to himself--sent faint, especially-tuned\nshort wave impulses to the steering-rockets of the drone. The\nliquid-fuel rockets were designed to steer a loaded ship. With the\nairlock door open, the silvery ship leaped out of the dock like a\nfrightened horse. The liquid-fuel rocket had a nearly empty hull to\naccelerate. It responded skittishly.\n\nJoe watched out a port as it went hurtling away. The vast Earth rolled\nbeneath it. It sped on and vanished. Its fumes ceased to be visible. Joe\ntold Brent:\n\n\"Another nice job, that! We sent it backward, slowing it a little. It'll\nhave a new orbit, independent of ours and below it. But come sixty hours\nit will be directly underneath. We'll haul it up and refuel it. And our\nfriends the enemy will hate it. It's a radio repeater. It'll pick up\nshort-wave stuff beamed to it, and repeat it down to Earth. And they can\ntry to jam that!\"\n\nIt was a mildly malicious trick to play. Behind the Iron Curtain,\nbroadcasts from the free world couldn't be heard because of stations\nbuilt to emit pure noise and drown them out. But the jamming stations\nwere on the enemy nations' borders. If radio programs came down from\noverhead, jamming would be ineffective at least in the center of the\nnations. Populations would hear the truth, even though their governments\nobjected.\n\nBut that was a minor matter, after all. With space ship hulls coming\ninto being by dozens, and with one convoy of hundreds of tons of\nequipment gotten aloft, the whole picture of supply for the Platform had\nchanged.\n\nPart of the new picture was two devices that Haney and the Chief were\nassembling. They were mostly metal backbone and a series of tanks, with\nrocket motors mounted on ball and socket joints. They looked like huge\nred insects, but they were officially rocket recovery vehicles, and\nJoe's crew referred to them as space wagons. They had no cabin, but\nsomething like a saddle. Before it there was a control-board complete\nwith radar-screens. And there were racks to which solid-fuel rockets of\ndivers sizes could be attached. They were literally short-range tow\ncraft for travel in space. They had the stripped, barren look of farm\nmachinery. So the name \"space wagon\" fitted. There were two of them.\n\n\"We're putting the pair together,\" the Chief told Joe. \"Looks kinda\npeculiar.\"\n\n\"It's only for temporary use,\" said Joe. \"There's a bigger and better\none being built with a regular cabin and hull. But some experience with\nthese two will be useful in running a regular space tug.\"\n\nThe Chief said with a trace too much of casualness: \"I'm kind of looking\nforward to testing this.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Joe doggedly. \"I'm responsible. I take the first chance. But\nwe should all be able to handle them. When this is assembled you can\nstand by with the second one. If the first one works all right, we'll\ntry the second.\"\n\nThe Chief grimaced, but he went back to the assembly of the spidery\ndevice.\n\nJoe got out the gravity-simulator harnesses. He showed Brent how they\nworked. Brown hadn't official instructions to order their use, but Joe\nput one on himself, set for full Earth-gravity simulation. He couldn't\nimitate actual gravity, of course. Only the effect of gravity on one's\nmuscles. There were springs and elastic webbing pulling one's shoulders\nand feet together, so that it was as much effort to stand extended--with\none's legs straight out--as to stand upright on Earth. Joe felt better\nwith a pull on his body.\n\nBrent was upset when he found that to him more than a tenth of normal\ngravity was unbearable. But he kept it on at that. If he increased the\npull a very little every day, he might be able to return to Earth, in\ntime. Now it would be a very dangerous business indeed. He went off to\nput the other members of the crew in the same sort of harness.\n\nAfter ten hours, a second drone broadcaster went off into space. By that\ntime the articulated red frameworks were assembled. They looked more\nthan ever like farm machinery, save that their bulging tanks made them\nlook insectile, too. They were actually something between small\ntow-boats and crash-wagons. A man in a space suit could climb into the\nsaddle of one of these creations, plug in the air-line of his suit to\nthe crash-wagon's tanks, and travel in space by means of the space\nwagon's rockets. These weird vehicles had remarkably powerful magnetic\ngrapples. They were equipped with steering rockets as powerful as those\nof a ship. They had banks of solid-fuel rockets of divers power and\nlength of burning. And they even mounted rocket missiles, small guided\nrockets which could be used to destroy what could not be recovered. They\nwere intended to handle unmanned rocket shipments of supplies to the\nPlatform. There were reasons why the trick should be economical, if it\nshould happen to work at all.\n\nWhen they were ready for testing, they seemed very small in the great\nspace lock. Joe and the Chief very carefully checked an extremely long\nlist of things that had to work right or nothing would work at all. That\npart of the job wasn't thrilling, but Joe no longer looked for thrills.\nHe painstakingly did the things that produced results. If a sense of\nadventure seemed to disappear, the sensations of achievement more than\nmade up for it.\n\nThey got into space suits. They were in an odd position on the Platform.\nLieutenant Commander Brown had avoided Joe as much as possible since his\narrival. So far he'd carefully avoided giving him direct orders, because\nJoe was not certainly and officially his subordinate. Lacking exact\ninformation, the only thing a conscientious rank-conscious naval officer\ncould do was exercise the maximum of tact and insistently ask authority\nfor a ruling on Joe's place in the hierarchy of rank.\n\nJoe flung a leg over his eccentric, red-painted mount. He clipped his\nsafety-belt, plugged in his suit air-supply to the space wagon's tanks,\nand spoke into his helmet transmitter.\n\n\"Okay to open the lock. Chief, you keep watch. If I make out all right,\nyou can join me. If I get in serious trouble, come after me in the ship\nwe rode up. But only if it's practical! Not otherwise!\"\n\nThe Chief said something in Mohawk. He sounded indignant.\n\nThe plastic walls of the lock swelled inward, burying and overwhelming\nthem. Pumps pounded briefly, removing what air was left. Then the walls\ndrew back, straining against their netting, and Joe waited for the door\nto open to empty space.\n\nInstead, there came a sharp voice in his helmet-phones. It was Brown.\n\"_Radar says there's a rocket on the way up! It's over at what is the\nedge of the world from here. Three gravities only. Better not go out!_\"\n\nJoe hesitated. Brown still issued no order. But defense against a single\nrocket would be a matter of guided missiles--Brown's business--if the\ntin can screen didn't handle it. Joe would have no part in it. He\nwouldn't be needed. He couldn't help. And there'd be all the elaborate\nbusiness of checking to go through again. He said uncomfortably:\n\n\"It'll be a long time before it gets here--and three gravities is low!\nMaybe it's a defective job. There have been misfires and so on. It won't\ntake long to try this wagon, anyhow. They're anxious to send up a robot\nship from the Shed and these have to be tested first. Give me ten\nminutes.\"\n\nHe heard the Chief grumbling to himself. But one tested space wagon was\nbetter than none.\n\nThe airlock doors opened. Huge round valves swung wide. Bright, remote,\nswarming stars filled the opening. Joe cracked the control of his\nforward liquid-fuel rockets. The lock filled instantly with swirling\nfumes. And instantly the tiny space wagon moved. It did not have to lift\nfrom the lock floor. Once the magnetic clamps were released it was free\nof the floor. But it did have mass. One brief push of the rockets sent\nit floating out of the lock. It was in space. It kept on.\n\nJoe felt a peculiar twinge of panic. Nobody who is accustomed only to\nEarth can quite realize at the beginning the conditions of handling\nvehicles in space. But Joe cracked the braking rockets. He stopped. He\nhung seemingly motionless in space. The Platform was a good half-mile\naway.\n\nHe tried the gyros, and the space wagon went into swift spinning. He\nreversed them and straightened out--almost. The vastness of all creation\nseemed still to revolve slowly about him. The monstrous globe which was\nEarth moved sedately from above his head to under his feet and continued\nthe slow revolution. The Platform rotated in a clockwise direction. He\nwas drifting very slowly away.\n\n\"Chief,\" he said wrily, \"you can't do worse than I'm doing, and we're\nrushed for time. You might come out. But listen! You don't run your\nrockets! On Earth you keep a motor going because when it stops, you do.\nBut out here you have to use your motor to stop, but not to keep on\ngoing. Get it? When you do come out, don't burn your rockets more than\nhalf a second at a time.\"\n\nThe Chief's voice came booming:\n\n\"_Right, Joe! Here I come!_\"\n\nThere was a billowing of frantically writhing fumes, which darted madly\nin every direction until they ceased to be. The Chief in his insect-like\ncontraption came bolting out of the hole which was the airlock. He was a\ngood half-mile away. The rocket fumes ceased. He kept on going. Joe\nheard him swear. The Chief felt the utterly helpless sensation of a man\nin a car when his brakes don't work. But a moment later the braking\nrockets did flare briefly, yet still too long. The Chief was not only\nstopped, but drifting backwards toward the Platform. He evidently tried\nto turn, and he spun as dizzily as Joe had done. But after a moment he\nstopped--almost. There were, then, two red-painted things in space,\nsomewhat like giant water-spiders floating forlornly in emptiness. They\nseemed very remote from the great bright steel Platform and that\ngigantic ball which was Earth, turning very slowly and filling a good\nfourth of all that could be seen.\n\n\"Suppose you head toward me, Chief,\" said Joe absorbedly. \"Aim to pass,\nand remember that what you have to estimate is not where I am, but where\nyou have to put on the brakes to stop close by. That's where you use\nyour braking-rockets.\"\n\nThe Chief tried it. He came to a stop a quarter-mile past Joe.\n\n\"_I'm heavy-handed_,\" said his voice disgustedly.\n\n\"I'll try to join you,\" said Joe.\n\nHe did try. He stopped a little short. The two weird objects drifted\nalmost together. The Chief was upside down with regard to Joe. Presently\nhe was sidewise on.\n\n\"This takes thinking,\" said Joe ruefully.\n\nA voice in his headphones, from the Platform, said:\n\n\"_That rocket from Earth is still accelerating. Still at three\ngravities. It looks like it isn't defective. It might be carrying a man.\nHadn't you better come in?_\"\n\nThe Chief growled: \"_We won't be any safer there! I want to get the hang\nof this._\" Then his voice changed sharply. \"_Joe! D'you get that?_\"\n\nJoe heard his own voice, very cold.\n\n\"I didn't. I do now. Brown, I'd suggest a guided missile at that rocket\ncoming up. If there's a man in it, he's coming up to take over guided\nmissiles that'll overtake him, and try to smash the Platform by direct\ncontrol, since proximity fuses don't work. I'd smash him as far away as\npossible.\"\n\nBrown's voice came very curt and worried. \"_Right._\"\n\nThere was an eruption of rocket fumes from the side of the Platform.\nSomething went foaming away toward Earth. It dwindled with incredible\nrapidity. Then Joe said:\n\n\"Chief, I think we'd better go down and meet that rocket. We'll learn to\nhandle these wagons on the way. I think we're going to have a fight on\nour hands. Whoever's in that rocket isn't coming up just to shake hands\nwith us.\"\n\nHe steadied the small red vehicle and pointed it for Earth. He added:\n\n\"I'm firing a six-two solid-fuel job, Chief. Counting three.\nThree--two--one.\"\n\nHis mount vanished in rocket fumes. But after six seconds at two\ngravities acceleration the rocket burned out. The Chief had fired a\nmatching rocket. They were miles apart, but speeding Earthward on very\nnearly identical courses.\n\nThe Platform grew smaller. That was their only proof of motion.\n\nA very, very long time passed. The Chief fired his steering rockets to\nbring him closer to Joe. It did not work. He had to aim for Joe and fire\na blast to move noticeably nearer. Presently he would have to blast\nagain to keep from passing.\n\nJoe made calculations in his head. He worried. He and the Chief were\nspeeding Earthward--away from the Platform--at more than four miles a\nminute, but it was not enough. The manned rocket was accelerating at a\ngreat deal more than that rate. And if the Platform's enemies down on\nEarth had sent a manned rocket up to destroy the Platform, the man in it\nwould have ways of defending himself. He would expect guided\nmissiles--but he probably wouldn't expect to be attacked by space\nwagons.\n\nJoe said suddenly:\n\n\"Chief! I'm going to burn a twelve-two. We've got to match velocities\ncoming back. Join me? Three--two--one.\"\n\nHe fired a twelve-two. Twelve seconds burning, two gravities\nacceleration. It built up his speed away from the Platform to a rate\nwhich would have been breathless, on Earth. But here there was no\nsensation of motion, and the distances were enormous. Things which\nhappen in space happen with insensate violence and incredible swiftness.\nBut long, long, long intervals elapse between events. The twelve-two\nrocket burned out. The Chief had matched that also.\n\nBrown's voice in the headphones said, \"_The rocket's cut acceleration.\nIt's floating up, now. It should reach our orbit fifty miles behind us.\nBut our missile should hit it in forty seconds._\"\n\n\"I wouldn't bet on that,\" said Joe coldly. \"Figure interception data for\nthe Chief and me. Make it fast!\"\n\nHe spotted the Chief, a dozen miles away and burning his steering\nrockets to close, again. The Chief had the hang of it, now. He didn't\ntry to steer. He drove toward Joe.\n\nBut nothing happened. And nothing happened. And nothing happened. The\ntwo tiny space wagons were 90 miles from the Platform, which was now\nmerely a glittering speck, hardly brighter than the brightest stars.\n\nThere was a flare of light to Earthward. It was brighter than the sun.\nThe light vanished.\n\nBrown's voice came in the headphones, \"_Our missile went off 200 miles\nshort! He sent an interceptor to set it off!_\"\n\n\"Then he's dangerous,\" said Joe. \"There'll be war rockets coming up any\nsecond now for him to control from right at hand. We won't be fighting\nrockets controlled from 4,000 miles away! They've found proximity fuses\ndon't work, so he's going to work in close. Give us our course and data,\nquick! The Chief and I have got to try to smash things!\"\n\nThe two tiny space wagons--like stick-insects in form, absurdly painted\na brilliant red--seemed inordinately lonely. It was hardly possible to\npick out the Platform with the naked eyes. The Earth was thousands of\nmiles below. Joe and the Chief, in space suits, rode tiny metal\nframeworks in an emptiness more vast, more lonely, more terrible than\neither could have imagined.\n\nThen the war rockets started up. There were eight of them. They came out\nto do murder at ten gravities acceleration.\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nBut even at ten gravities' drive it takes time to travel 4,000 miles. At\nthree, and coasting a great deal of the way, it takes much longer. The\nPlatform circled Earth in four hours and a little more. Anything\nintending interception and rising straight up needed to start skyward\nlong before the Platform was overhead. A three-g rocket would start\nwhile the Platform was still below the western horizon from its\nlaunching-spot. Especially if it planned to coast part of its\njourney--and a three-gravity rocket would have to coast most of the way.\n\nSo there was time. Coasting, the rising manned rocket would be losing\nspeed. If it planned to go no higher than the Platform's orbit, its\nupward velocity would be zero there. If it were intercepted 500 miles\ndown, it would be rising at an almost leisurely rate, and Joe and the\nChief could check their Earthward plunge and match its rising rate.\n\nThis they did. But what they couldn't do was match its orbital velocity,\nwhich was zero. They had the Platform's eastward speed to start\nwith--over 200 miles a minute. No matter how desperately they fired\nbraking-rockets, they couldn't stop and maneuver around the rising\ncontrol-ship. Inevitably they would simply flash past it in the fraction\nof an instant. To fire their tiny guided missiles on ahead would be\nalmost to assure that they would miss. Also, the enemy ship was manned.\nIt could fight back.\n\nBut Joe had been on the receiving end of one attack in space. It wasn't\nmuch experience, but it was more than anybody but he and his own crew\npossessed.\n\n\"Chief,\" said Joe softly into his helmet-mike, as if by speaking softly\nhe could keep from being overheard, \"get close enough to me to see what\nI do, and do it too. I can't tell you more. Whoever's running this\nrocket might know English.\"\n\nThere was a flaring of vapor in space. The Chief was using his\nsteering-rockets to draw near.\n\nJoe spun his little space wagon about, so that it pointed back in the\ndirection from which he had come. He had four guided missiles,\ndemolition type. Very deliberately, he fired the four of them\nastern--away from the rising rocket. They were relatively low-speed\nmissiles, intended to blow up a robot ship that couldn't be hooked onto,\nbecause it was traveling too much faster or slower than the Platform it\nwas intended to reach. The missiles went away. Then Joe faced about\nagain in the direction of his prospective target. The Chief fumed--Joe\nheard him--but he duplicated Joe's maneuver. He faced his own eccentric\nvessel in the direction of its line of flight.\n\nThen his fuming suddenly ceased. Joe's headphones brought his explosive\ngrunt when he suddenly saw the idea.\n\n\"_Joe! I wish you could talk Indian! I could kiss you for this trick!_\"\n\nBrown's voice said anxiously: \"_I'm going to let that manned rocket have\na couple more shots._\"\n\n\"Let us get by first,\" said Joe. \"Then maybe you can use them on the\nbombs coming up.\"\n\nHe could see the trails of war-rockets on the way out from Earth. They\nwere infinitesimal threads of vapor. They were the thinnest possible\nfilaments of gossamer white. But they enlarged as they rose. They were\nclimbing at better than two miles per second, now, and still increasing\ntheir speed.\n\nBut the arena in which this conflict took place was so vast that\neverything seemed to take place in slow motion. There was time to reason\nout not only the method of attack from Earth, but the excuse for it. If\nthe Platform vanished from space, no matter from what cause, its enemies\nwould announce vociferously that it had been destroyed by its own\natomic bombs, exploding spontaneously. Even in the face of proof of\nmurder, enemy nations would stridently insist that bombs intended for\nthe enslavement of humanity--in the Platform--had providentially\ndetonated and removed that instrument of war-mongering scoundrelly\nimperialists from the skies. There might be somebody, somewhere, who\nwould believe it.\n\nJoe and the Chief were steadied now nearly on a line to intercept the\nrising manned rocket. They had already fired their missiles, which\ntrailed them. They went into battle, not prepared to shoot, but with\ntheir ammunition expended. For which there was excellent reason.\n\nSomething came foaming toward them from the nearby man-carrying rocket.\nIt seemed like a side-spout from the column of vapor rising from Earth.\nActually it was a guided missile.\n\n\"Now we dodge,\" said Joe cheerfully. \"Remember the trick of this\nmaneuvering business!\"\n\nIt was simple. Speeding toward the rising assassin, and with his\nmissiles rushing toward them, the relative speeds of the wagons and the\nmissiles were added together. If the space wagons dodged, the missile\noperator had less time to swing his guided rockets to match the change\nof target course. And besides, the attacker hadn't made a single turn in\nspace. Not yet. He might know that a rocket doesn't go where it's\npointed, as a matter of theory. He might even know intellectually that\nthe final speed and course of a rocket is the sum of all its previous\nspeeds and courses. But he hadn't used the knowledge Joe and the Chief\nhad.\n\nSomething rushed at them. They went into evasive action. And they didn't\nmerely turn the noses of their space wagons. They flung them about\nend-for-end, and blasted. They used wholly different accelerations at\nodd angles. Joe shot away from Earth on steering rocket thrust, and\ntouched off a four-three while he faced toward Earth's north pole, and\nhalfway along that four-second rush he flipped his craft in a somersault\nand the result was nearly a right-angled turn. When the four-three\nburned out he set off a twelve-two, and halfway through its burning\nfired a three-two with it, so that at the beginning he had two gravities\nacceleration, then four gravities for three seconds, and then two again.\n\nWith long practice, a man might learn marksmanship in space. But all a\nman's judgment of speeds is learned on Earth, where things always,\nalways, always move steadily. Nobody making his first space-flight could\npossibly hit such targets as Joe and the Chief made of themselves. The\nman in the enemy rocket was making his first flight. Also, Joe and the\nChief had an initial velocity of 200 miles a minute toward him. The\nmarksman in the rising rocket hadn't a chance. He fired four more\nmissiles and tried desperately to home them in. But----\n\nThey flashed past his rising course. And then they were quite safe from\nhis fire, because it would take a very long time indeed for anything he\nshot after them to catch up. But their missiles had still to pass\nhim--and Joe and the Chief could steer them without any concern about\ntheir own safety or anything else but a hit.\n\nThey made a hit.\n\nTwo of the eight little missiles flashed luridly, almost together, where\nthe radar-pips showed the rocket to be. Then there were two parts to the\nrocket, separating. One was small and one was fairly large. Another\ndemolition-missile hit the larger section. Still another exploded as\nthat was going to pieces. The smaller fragment ceased to be important.\nThe explosions weren't atomic bombs, of course. They were only\ndemolition-charges. But they demolished the manned rocket admirably.\n\nBrown's voice came in the headphones, still tense. \"_You got it! How\nabout the others?_\"\n\nJoe felt a remarkable exhilaration. Later he might think about the poor\ndevil--there could have been only one--who had been destroyed some 3,700\nmiles above the surface of the Earth. He might think unhappily of that\nman as a victim of hatred rather than as a hater. He might become\nextremely uncomfortable about this, but at the moment he felt merely\nthat he and the Chief had won a startling victory.\n\n\"I think,\" he said, \"that you can treat them with silent contempt. They\nwon't have proximity fuses. Those friends of ours who want so badly to\nkill us have found that proximity fuses don't work. Unless one is on a\ncollision course I don't think you need to do anything about them.\"\n\nThe Chief was muttering to himself in Mohawk, twenty miles away. Joe\nsaid:\n\n\"Chief, how about getting back to the Platform?\"\n\nThe Chief growled. \"_My great-grandfather would disown me! Winning a\nfight and no scalp to show! Not even counting coup! He'd disown me!_\"\n\nBut Joe saw his rockets flare, away off against the stars.\n\nThe war rockets were very near, now. They still emitted monstrous\njettings of thick white vapor. They climbed up with incredible speed.\nOne went by Joe at a distance of little more than a mile, and its fumes\neddied out to half that before they thinned to nothingness. They went on\nand on and on....\n\nThey burned out somewhere. It would be a long time before they fell back\nto Earth. Hours, probably. Then they would be meteors. They'd vaporize\nbefore they touched solidity. They wouldn't even explode.\n\nBut Joe and the Chief rode back to the Platform. It was surprising how\nhard it was to match speed with it again, to make a good entrance into\nthe giant lock. They barely made it before the Platform made its plunge\ninto that horrible blackness which was the Earth's shadow. And Joe was\nvery glad they did make it before then. He wouldn't have liked to be\nmerely astride a skinny framework in that ghastly darkness, with the\nmonstrous blackness of the Abyss seeming to be trying to devour him.\n\nHaney met them in the airlock. He grinned.\n\n\"Nice job, Joe! Nice job, Chief!\" he said warmly. \"Uh--the Lieutenant\nCommander wants you to report to him, Joe. Right away.\"\n\nJoe cocked an eyebrow at him.\n\n\"What for?\"\n\nHaney spread out his hands. The Chief grunted. \"That guy bothers me.\nI'll bet, Joe, he's going to explain you shouldn't've gone out when he\ndidn't want you to. Me, I'm keeping away from him!\"\n\nThe Chief shed his space suit and swaggered away, as well as anyone\ncould swagger while walking on what happened to be the ceiling, from\nJoe's point of view. Joe put his space gear in its proper place. He went\nto the small cubbyhole that Brown had appropriated for the office of the\nPlatform Commander. Joe went in, naturally without saluting.\n\nBrown sat in a fastened-down chair with thigh grips holding him in\nplace. He was writing. On Joe's entry, he carefully put the pen down on\na magnetized plate that would hold it until he wanted it again.\nOtherwise it could have floated anywhere about the room.\n\n\"Mr. Kenmore,\" said Brown awkwardly, \"you did a very nice piece of work.\nIt's too bad you aren't in the Navy.\"\n\nJoe said: \"It did work out pretty fortunately. It's lucky the Chief and\nI were out practicing, but now we can take off when a rocket's reported,\nany time.\"\n\nBrown cleared his throat. \"I can thank you personally,\" he said\nunhappily, \"and I do. But--really this situation is intolerable! How can\nI report this affair? I can't suggest commendation, or a promotion,\nor--anything! I don't even know how to refer to you! I am going to ask\nyou, Mr. Kenmore, to put through a request that your status be\nclarified. I would imagine that your status would mean a rank--hm--about\nequivalent to a lieutenant junior grade in the Navy.\"\n\nJoe grinned.\n\n\"I have--ah--prepared a draft you might find helpful,\" said Brown\nearnestly. \"It's necessary for something to be done. It's urgent! It's\nimportant!\"\n\n\"Sorry,\" said Joe. \"The important thing to me is getting ready to load\nup the Platform with supplies from Earth. Excuse me.\"\n\nHe went out of the office. He made his way to the quarters assigned\nhimself and his crew. Mike greeted him with reproachful eyes. Joe waved\nhis hand.\n\n\"Don't say it, Mike! The answer is yes. See that the tanks are refilled,\nand new rockets put in place. Then you and Haney go out and practice.\nBut no farther than ten miles from the Platform. Understand?\"\n\n\"No!\" said Mike rebelliously. \"It's a dirty trick!\"\n\n\"Which,\" Joe assured him, \"I commit only because there's a robot ship\nfrom Bootstrap coming up any time now. And we'll need to pick it up and\ntow it here.\"\n\nHe went to the control-room to see if he could get a vision connection\nto Earth.\n\nHe got the beam, and he got Sally on the screen. A report of the attack\non the Platform had evidently already gone down to Earth. Sally's\nexpression was somehow drawn and haunted. But she tried to talk lightly.\n\n\"Derring-do and stuff, Joe?\" she asked. \"How does it feel to be a\nvictorious warrior?\"\n\n\"It feels rotten,\" he told her. \"There must have been somebody in the\nrocket we blew up. He felt like a patriot, I guess, trying to murder us;\nBut I feel like a butcher.\"\n\n\"Maybe you didn't do it,\" she said. \"Maybe the Chief's bombs----\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" said Joe. He hesitated. \"Hold up your hand.\"\n\nShe held it up. His ring was still on it. She nodded. \"Still there. When\nwill you be back?\"\n\nHe shook his head. He didn't know. It was curious that one wanted\nso badly to talk to a girl after doing something that was\nblood-stirring--and left one rather sickish afterward. This business of\nspace travel and even space battle was what he'd dreamed of, and he\nstill wanted it. But it was very comforting to talk to Sally, who hadn't\nhad to go through any of it.\n\n\"Write me a letter, will you?\" he asked. \"We can't tie up this beam very\nlong.\"\n\n\"I'll write you all the news that's allowed to go out,\" she assured him.\n\"Be seeing you, Joe.\"\n\nHer image faded from the screen. And, thinking it over, he couldn't see\nthat either of them had said anything of any importance at all. But he\nwas very glad they'd talked together.\n\nThe first robot ship came up some eight hours later--two revolutions\nafter the television call. Mike was ready hours in advance, fidgeting.\nThe robot ship started up while the Platform was over the middle of the\nPacific. It didn't try to make a spiral approach as all other ships had\ndone. It came straight up, and it started from the ground. No pushpots.\nIts take-off rockets were monsters. They pushed upward at ten gravities\nuntil it was out of atmosphere, and then they stepped up to fifteen.\nMuch later, the robot turned on its side and fired orbital speed rockets\nto match velocity with the Platform.\n\nThere were two reasons for the vertical rise, and the high acceleration.\nIf a robot ship went straight up, it wouldn't pass over enemy territory\nuntil it was high enough to be protected by the Platform. And--it costs\nfuel to carry fuel to be burned. So if the rocketship could get up speed\nfor coasting to orbit in the first couple of hundred miles, it needn't\nhaul its fuel so far. It was economical to burn one's fuel fast and get\nan acceleration that would kill a human crew. Hence robots.\n\nThe landing of the first robot ship at the Platform was almost as\nmatter-of-fact as if it had been done a thousand times before. From the\nPlatform its dramatic take-off couldn't be seen, of course. It first\nappeared aloft as a pip on a radar screen. Then Mike prepared to go out\nand hook on to it and tow it in. He was in his space suit and in the\nlanding lock, though his helmet faceplate was still open. A loudspeaker\nboomed suddenly in Brown's voice: \"_Evacuate airlock and prepare to take\noff!_\"\n\nJoe roared: \"Hold that!\"\n\nBrown's voice, very official, came: \"_Withhold execution of that order.\nYou should not be in the airlock, Mr. Kenmore. You will please make way\nfor operational procedure._\"\n\n\"We're checking the space wagon,\" snapped Joe. \"That's operational\nprocedure!\"\n\nThe loudspeaker said severely: \"_The checking should have been done\nearlier!_\"\n\nThere was silence. Mike and Joe, together, painstakingly checked over\nthe very many items that had to be made sure. Every rocket had to have\nits firing circuit inspected. The tanks' contents and pressure verified.\nThe air connection to Mike's space suit. The air pressure. The device\nthat made sure that air going to Mike's space suit was neither as hot\nas metal in burning sunlight, nor cold as the chill of a shadow in\nspace.\n\nEverything checked. Mike straddled his red-painted mount. Joe left the\nlock and said curtly:\n\n\"Okay to pump the airlock. Okay to open airlock doors when ready. Go\nahead.\"\n\nMike went out, and Joe watched from a port in the Platform's hull. The\ndrone from Earth was five miles behind the Platform in its orbit, and\ntwenty miles below, and all of ten miles off-course. Joe saw Mike scoot\nthe red space wagon to it, stop short with a sort of cocky\nself-assurance, hook on to the tow-ring in the floating space-barge's\nnose, and blast off back toward the Platform with it in tow.\n\nMike had to turn about and blast again to check his motion when he\narrived. And then he and Haney--Haney in the other space wagon--nudged\nat it and tugged at it and got it in the great spacelock. They went in\nafter it and the lock doors closed.\n\nNeither Mike nor Haney were out of their space suits when Kent brought\nJoe a note. A note was an absurdity in the Platform. But this was a\nformal communication from Brown.\n\n    \"_From: Lt. Comdr. Brown\n\n    To: Mr. Kenmore\n\n    Subject: Cooperation and courtesy in rocket recovery vehicle\n             launchings.\n\n    1. There is a regrettable lack of coordination and courtesy in the\n       launching of rocket-recovery vehicles (space wagons) in the\n       normal operation of the Platform.\n\n    2. The maintenance of discipline and efficiency requires that the\n       commanding officer maintain overall control of all operations at\n       all times.\n\n    3. Hereafter when a space vehicle of any type is to be launched, the\n       commanding officer will be notified in writing not less than one\n       hour before such launching.\n\n    4. The time of such proposed launching will be given in such\n       notification in hours and minutes and seconds, Greenwich Mean\n       Time.\n\n    5. All commands for launching will be given by the commanding\n       officer or an officer designated by him._\"\n\nJoe received the memo as he was in the act of writing a painstaking\nreport on the maneuver Mike had carried out. Mike was radiant as he\ndiscussed possible improvements with later and better equipment. After\nall, this had been a lucky landing. For a robot to end up no more than\n30 miles from its target, after a journey of 4,000 miles, and with a\ndifference in velocity that was almost immeasurable--such good fortune\ncouldn't be expected as a regular thing. The space wagons were tiny. If\nthey had to travel long distances to recover erratic ships coming up\nfrom Earth----\n\nJoe forgot all about Lieutenant Commander Brown and his memo when the\nmail was distributed. Joe had three letters from Sally. He read them in\nthe great living compartment of the Platform with its sixty-foot length\nand its carpet on floor and ceiling, and the galleries without stairs\noutside the sleeping cabins. He sat in a chair with thigh grips to hold\nhim in place, and he wore a gravity simulation harness. It was\nnecessary. The regular crew of the Platform, by this time, couldn't have\nhandled space wagons in action against enemy manned rockets. Joe meant\nto stay able to take acceleration.\n\nIt was just as he finished his mail that Brent came in.\n\n\"Big news!\" said Brent. \"They're building a big new ship of new\ndesign--almost half as big as the Platform. With concreted metal they\ncan do it in weeks.\"\n\n\"What's it for?\" demanded Joe.\n\n\"It'll be a human base on the Moon,\" said Brent relievedly. \"An\nexpedition will start in six weeks, according to plan. As long as we're\nthe only American base in space, we're going to be shot at. But a base\non the Moon will be invulnerable. So they're going ahead with it.\"\n\nJoe said hopefully:\n\n\"Any orders for me to join it?\"\n\nBrent shook his head. \"We're to be loaded up with supplies for the Moon\nexpedition. We're to be ready to take a robot ship every round.\nActually, they can't hope to send us more than two a day for a while,\nbut even that'll be eighty tons of supplies to be stored away.\"\n\nThe Chief grumbled, but somehow his grumbling did not sound genuine.\n\"They're going to the Moon--and leave us here to do stevedore stuff?\"\nHis tone was odd. He looked at a letter he'd been reading and gave up\npretense. He said self-consciously: \"Listen, you guys.... My tribe's got\nall excited. I just got a letter from the council. They've been having\nan argument about me. Wanna hear?\"\n\nHe was a little amused, and a little embarrassed, but something had\nhappened to make him feel good.\n\n\"Let's have it,\" said Joe. Mike was very still in another chair. He\ndidn't look up, though he must have heard. Haney cocked an interested\near.\n\nThe Chief said awkwardly, \"You know--us Mohawks are kinda proud. We got\nsomething to be proud of. We were one of the Five Nations, when that was\na sort of United Nations and all Europe was dog-eat-dog. My tribe had a\nbig pow-wow about me. There's a tribe member that's a professor of\nanthropology out in Chicago. He was there. And a couple of guys that do\nelectronic research, and doctors and farmers and all sorts of guys. All\nMohawks. They got together in tribal council.\"\n\nHe stopped and flushed under his dark skin. \"I wouldn't tell you, only\nyou guys are in on it.\"\n\nStill he hesitated. Joe found a curious picture forming in his mind.\nHe'd known the Chief a long time, and he knew that part of the tribe\nlived in Brooklyn, and individual members were widely scattered. But\nstill there was a certain remote village which to all the tribesmen was\nhome. Everybody went back there from time to time, to rest from the\nstrangeness of being Indians in a world of pale-skinned folk.\n\nJoe could almost imagine the council. There'd be old, old men who could\nnearly remember the days of the tribe's former glory, who'd heard\nstories of forest warfare and zestful hunts, and scalpings and heroic\ndeeds from their grandfathers. But there were also doctors and lawyers\nand technical men in that council which met to talk about the Chief.\n\n\"It's addressed to me,\" said the Chief with sudden clumsiness, \"in the\nWorld-by-itself Canoe. That's the Platform here. And it says--I'll have\nto translate, because it's in Mohawk.\" He took a deep breath. \"It says,\n'We your tribesmen have heard of your journeyings off the Earth where\nmen have never traveled before. This has given us great pride, that one\nof our tribe and kin had ventured so valiantly.'\" The Chief grinned\nabashedly. He went on. \"'In full assembly, the elders of the tribe have\nheld counsel on a way to express their pride in you, and in the friends\nyou have made who accompanied you. It was proposed that you be given a\nnew name to be borne by your sons after you. It was proposed that the\ntribe accept from each of its members a gift to be given you in the name\nof the tribe. But these were not considered great enough. Therefore the\ntribe, in full council, has decreed that your name shall be named at\nevery tribal council of the Mohawks from this day to the end of time, as\none the young braves would do well to copy in all ways. And the names of\nyour friends Joe Kenmore, Mike Scandia, and Thomas Haney shall also be\nnamed as friends whose like all young braves should strive to seek out\nand to be.'\"\n\nThe Chief sweated a little, but he looked enormously proud. Joe went\nover to him and shook hands warmly. The Chief almost broke his fingers.\nIt was, of course, as high an honor as could be paid to anybody by the\npeople who paid it.\n\nHaney said awkwardly, \"Lucky they don't know me like you do, Chief. But\nit's swell!\"\n\nWhich it was. But Mike hadn't said a word. The Chief said exuberantly:\n\n\"Did you hear that, Mike? Every Mohawk for ten thousand years is gonna\nbe told that you were a swell guy! Crazy, huh?\"\n\nMike said in an odd voice: \"Yeah. I didn't mean that, Chief. It's fine!\nBut I--I got a letter. I--never thought to get a letter like this.\"\n\nHe looked unbelievingly at the paper in his hands.\n\n\"Mash note?\" asked the Chief. His tone was a little bit harsh. Mike was\na midget. And there were women who were fools. It would be unbearable if\nsome half-witted female had written Mike the sort of gushing letter\nthat some half-witted females might write.\n\nMike shook his head, with an odd, quick smile.\n\n\"Not what you think, Chief. But it is from a girl. She sent me her\npicture. It's a--swell letter. I'm--going to answer it. You can look at\nher picture. She looks kind of--nice.\"\n\nHe handed the Chief a snapshot. The Chief's face changed. Haney looked\nover his shoulder. He passed the picture to Joe and said ferociously:\n\"You Mike! You doggoned Don Juan! The Chief and me have got to warn her\nwhat kinda guy you are! Stealing from blind men! Fighting cops----\"\n\nJoe looked at the picture. It was a very sweet small face, and the eyes\nthat looked out of the photograph were very honest and yearning. And Joe\nunderstood. He grinned at Mike. Because this girl had the distinctive\nlook that Mike had. She was a midget, too.\n\n\"She's--thirty-nine inches tall,\" said Mike, almost stunned. \"She's just\ntwo inches shorter than me. And--she says she doesn't mind being a\nmidget so much since she heard about me. I'm going to write her.\"\n\nBut it would be, of course, a long time before there was a way for mail\nto get down to Earth.\n\nIt was a long time. Now it was possible to send up robot rockets to the\nPlatform. They came up. When the second arrived, Haney went out to pull\nit in. Joe forgot to notify Brown, in writing, an hour before launching\na rocket recovery vehicle (space wagon) according to paragraph 3 of the\nformal memo, nor the time of launching in hours, minutes, etc., by\nGreenwich Mean Time (paragraph 4), nor was the testing of all equipment\nmade before moving it into the airlock. This was because the testing\nequipment was in the airlock, where it belonged. And the commands for\nlaunching were not given by Brown or an officer designated by him,\nbecause Joe forgot all about it.\n\nBrown made a stormy scene about the matter, and Joe was honestly\napologetic, but the Chief and Haney and Mike glared venomously.\n\nThe result was completely inconclusive. Joe had not been put under\nBrown's command. He and his crew were the only people on the Platform\nphysically in shape to operate the space wagons, considering the\nacceleration involved. Brent and the others were wearing gravity\nsimulators, and were building back to strength. But they weren't up to\npar as yet. They'd been in space too long.\n\nSo there was nothing Brown could do. He retreated into icily correct,\noutraged dignity. And the others hauled in and unloaded rockets as they\narrived. They came up fast. The processes of making them had been\nimproved. They could be made faster, heated to sintering temperature\nfaster, and the hulls cooled to usefulness in a quarter of the former\ntime. The production of space ship hulls went up to four a day, while\nthe molds for the Moonship were being worked even faster. The Moonship,\nactually, was assembled from precast individual cells which then were\nwelded together. It would have features the Platform lacked, because it\nwas designed to be a base for exploration and military activities in\naddition to research.\n\nBut only twenty days after the recovery and docking of the first robot\nship to rise, a new sort of ship entirely came blindly up as a robot.\nThe little space wagons hauled it to the airlock and inside. They\nunloaded it--and it was no longer a robot. It was a modified hull\ndesigned for the duties of a tug in space. It could carry a crew of\nfour, and its cargohold was accessible from the cabin. It had an\nairlock. More, it carried a cargo of solid-fuel rockets which could be\nshifted to firing racks outside its hull. Starting from the platform,\nwhere it had no effective weight, it was capable of direct descent to\nthe Earth without spiralling or atmospheric braking. To make that\ndescent it would, obviously, expend four-fifths of its loaded weight in\nrockets. And since it had no weight at the Platform, but only mass, it\nwas capable of far-ranging journeying. It could literally take off from\nthe Platform and reach the Moon and land on it, and then return to the\nPlatform.\n\nBut that had to wait.\n\n\"Sure we could do it,\" agreed Joe, when Mike wistfully pointed out the\npossibility. \"It would be good to try it. But unfortunately, space\nexploration isn't a stunt. We've gotten this far because--somebody\nwanted to do something. But----\" Then he said, \"It could be done and the\nUnited Nations wouldn't do it. So the United States had to, or--somebody\nelse would have. You can figure who that would be, and what use they'd\nmake of space travel! So it's important. It's more important than stunt\nflights we could make!\"\n\n\"Nobody could stop us if we wanted to take off!\" Mike said rebelliously.\n\n\"True,\" Joe said. \"But we four can stand three gravities acceleration\nand handle any more manned rockets that start out here. We've lived\nthrough plenty more than that! But Brent and the others couldn't put up\na fight in space. They're wearing harness now, and they're coming back\nto strength. But we're going to stay right here and do stevedoring--and\nfighting too, if it comes to that--until the job is done.\"\n\nAnd that was the way it was, too. Of stevedoring there was plenty. Two\nrobot ships a day for weeks on end. Three ships a day for a time. Four.\nSometimes things went smoothly, and the little space wagons could go out\nand bring back the great, rocket-scarred hulls from Earth. But once in\nthree times the robots were going too fast or too slow. The space wagons\ncouldn't handle them. Then the new ship, the space tug, went out and\nhooked onto the robot with a chain and used the power it had to bring\nthem to their destination. And sometimes the robots didn't climb\nstraight. At least once the space tug captured an erratic robot 400\nmiles from its destination and hauled it in. It used some heavy\nsolid-fuel rockets on that trip.\n\nThe Platform had become, in fact, a port in space, though so far it had\nhad only arrivals and no departures. Its storage compartments almost\nbulged with fuel stores and food stores and equipment of every\nimaginable variety. It had a stock of rockets which were enough to land\nit safely on Earth, though there was surely no intention of doing so. It\nhad food and air for centuries. It had repair parts for all its own\nequipment. And it had weapons. It contained, in robot hulls anchored to\nits sides, enough fissionable material to conduct a deadly war--which\nwas only stored for transfer to the Moon base when that should be\nestablished.\n\nAnd it had communication with Earth of high quality. So far the actual\nmail was only a one-way service, but even entertainment came up, and\nnews. Once there was a television shot of the interior of the Shed. It\nwas carefully scrambled before transmission, but it was a heartening\nsight. The Shed on the TV screen appeared a place of swarming activity.\nRobot hulls were being made. They were even improved, fined down to ten\ntons of empty weight apiece, and their controls were assembly line\nproducts now. And there was the space flight simulator with men\npracticing in it, although for the time being only robots were taking\noff from Earth. And there was the Moonship.\n\nIt didn't look like the Platform, but rather like something a child\nmight have put together out of building blocks. It was built up out of\nwelded-together cells with strengthening members added. It was 60 feet\nhigh from the floor and twice as long, and it did not weigh nearly what\nit seemed to. Already it was being clad in that thick layer of heat\ninsulation it would need to endure the two-week-long lunar night. It\ncould take off very soon now.\n\nThe pictured preparations back on Earth meant round-the-clock drudgery\nfor Joe and the others. They wore themselves out. But the storage space\non the Platform filled up. Days and weeks went by. Then there came a\ntime when literally nothing else could be stored, so Joe and his crew\nmade ready to go back to Earth.\n\nThey ate hugely and packed a very small cargo in their ship. They picked\nup one bag of mail and four bags of scientific records and photographs\nwhich had only been transmitted by facsimile TV before. They got into\nthe space tug. It floated free.\n\n\"_You will fire in ten seconds_,\" said a crisp voice in Joe's\nheadphones. \"_Ten ... nine ... eight ... seven ... six ... five ... four\n... three ... two ... one ... fire!_\"\n\nJoe crooked his index finger. There was an explosive jolt. Rockets\nflamed terribly in emptiness. The space tug rushed toward the west. The\nPlatform seemed to dwindle with startling suddenness. It seemed to rush\naway and become lost in the myriads of stars. The space tug accelerated\nat four gravities in the direction opposed to its orbital motion.\n\nAs the acceleration built up, it dropped toward Earth and home like a\ntumbled stone.\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nThere was bright sunshine at the Shed, not a single cloud in all the\nsky. The radar bowls atop the roof--they seemed almost invisibly small\ncompared with its vastness--wavered and shifted and quivered. Completely\ninvisible beams of microwaves lanced upward. Atop the Shed, in the\ncommunication room, there was the busy quiet of absolute intentness.\nSignals came down and were translated into visible records which fed\ninstantly into computers. Then the computers clicked and hummed and\nperformed incomprehensible integrations, and out of their slot-mouths\npoured billowing ribbons of printed tape. Men read those tapes and\ntalked crisply into microphones, and their words went swiftly aloft\nagain.\n\nDown by the open eastern door of the Shed at the desert's edge, Sally\nHolt and Joe's father waited together, watching the sky. Sally was white\nand scared. Joe's father patted her shoulder reassuringly.\n\n\"He'll make it, all right,\" said Sally, dry-throated.\n\nJoe's father nodded. \"Of course he will!\" But his voice was not steady.\n\n\"Nothing could happen to him now!\" said Sally fiercely.\n\n\"Of course not,\" said Joe's father.\n\nA loudspeaker close to them said abruptly: \"_Nineteen miles._\"\n\nThere was a tiny, straggling thread of white visible in the now. It\nthinned out to nothingness, but its nearest part flared out and flared\nout and flared out. It grew larger, came closer with a terrifying speed.\n\n\"_Twelve miles_,\" said the speaker harshly. \"_Rockets firing._\"\n\nThe downward-hurtling trail of smoke was like a crippled plane falling\nflaming from the sky, except that no plane ever fell so fast.\n\nAt seven miles the white-hot glare of the rocket flames was visible even\nin broad daylight. At three miles the light was unbearably bright. At\ntwo, the light winked out. Sally saw something which glittered come\nplummeting toward the ground, unsupported.\n\nIt fell almost half a mile before rocket fumes flung furiously out\nagain. Then it checked. Visibly, its descent was slowed. It dropped more\nslowly, and more slowly, and more slowly still....\n\nIt hung in mid-air a quarter-mile up. Then there was a fresh burst of\nrocket fumes, more monstrous than ever, and it went steadily downward,\ntouched the ground, and stayed there spurting terrible incandescent\nflames for seconds. Then the bottom flame went out. An instant later\nthere were no more flames at all.\n\nSally began to run toward the ship. She stopped. A procession of\nrumbling, clanking, earth-moving machinery moved out of the Shed and\ntoward the upright space tug. Prosaically, a bulldozer lowered its wide\nblade some fifty yards from the ship. It pushed a huge mass of earth\nbefore it, covering over the scorched and impossibly hot sand about the\nrocket's landing place. Other bulldozers began to circle methodically\naround and around, overturning the earth and burying the hot surface\nstuff. Water trucks sprayed, and thin steam arose.\n\nBut also an exit-port opened and Joe stood in the opening.\n\nThen Sally began to run again.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJoe sat at dinner in the major's quarters. Major Holt was there, and\nJoe's father, and Sally.\n\n\"It feels good,\" said Joe warmly, \"to use a knife and fork again, and to\npick food up from a plate where it stays until it's picked up!\"\n\n\"The crew of the Platform----\" Major Holt began.\n\n\"They're all right,\" said Joe, with his mouth full. \"They're wearing\ngravity simulator harness. Brent's got his up to three-quarters gravity.\nThey get tired, wearing the harness. They sleep better. Everything's\nfine! They can handle the space wagons we left and they've got guided\nmissiles to spare! They're all right!\"\n\nJoe's father said unsteadily, \"You'll stay on Earth a while now, son?\"\n\nSally moved quickly. She looked up, tense. But Joe said, \"They're going\nto get the Moonship up, sir. We came back--my gang and me--to help train\nthe crew. We only have a week to do it in, but we've got some combat\ntactics to show them on the training gadget in the Shed.\" He added\nanxiously, \"And, sir--they'll have to take the Moonship off in a spiral\norbit. She can't go straight up! That means she's got to pass over enemy\nterritory, and--we've got to have a real escort for her. A fighting\nescort. It's planned for the space tug to take off a few minutes after\nthe Moonship and blast along underneath. We'll dump guided missiles\nout--like drones--and if anything comes along we can start their rockets\nand fight our way through. And we four have had more experience than\nanybody else. We're needed!\"\n\n\"You've done enough, surely!\" Sally cried.\n\n\"The United States,\" said Joe awkwardly, \"is going to take over the\nMoon. I--can't miss having a hand in that! Not if it's at all possible!\"\n\n\"I'm afraid you will miss it, Joe,\" Major Holt said detachedly. \"The\noccupation of the Moon will be a Navy enterprise. Space Exploration\nProject facilities are being used to prepare for it, but the Navy won\nthe latest battle of the Pentagon. The Navy takes over the Moon.\"\n\nJoe looked startled. \"But----\"\n\n\"You're Space Exploration personnel,\" said the major with the same\ncoolness. \"You will be used to instruct naval personnel, and your space\ntug will be asked to go along to the Platform as an auxiliary vessel.\nFor purposes of assisting in the landing of the Moonship at the\nPlatform, you understand. You'll haul her away from the Platform when\nshe's refueled and supplied, so she can start off for the Moon. But the\noccupation of the Moon will be strictly Navy.\"\n\nJoe's expression became carefully unreadable. \"I think,\" he said evenly,\n\"I'd better not comment.\"\n\nMajor Holt nodded. \"Very wise--not that we'd repeat anything you did\nsay. But the point is, Joe, that just one day before the Moonship does\ntake off, the United Nations will be informed that it is a United States\nnaval vessel. The doctrine of the freedom of space--like the freedom of\nthe seas--will be promulgated. And the United States will say that a\nUnited States naval task force is starting off into space on an official\nmission. To attack a Space Exploration ship is one thing. That's like a\nscientific expedition. But to fire on an American warship on official\nbusiness is a declaration of war. Especially since that ship can shoot\nback--and will.\"\n\nJoe listened. He said, \"It's daring somebody to try another Pearl\nHarbor?\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" said the major. \"It's time for us to be firm--now that we can\nback it up. I don't think the Moonship will be fired on.\"\n\n\"But they'll need me and my gang just the same,\" said Joe slowly, \"for\ntugboat work at the Platform?\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" said the major.\n\n\"Then,\" Joe said doggedly, \"they get us. My gang will gripe about being\nedged out of the trip. They won't like it. But they'd like backing out\nstill less. We'll play it the way it's dealt--but we won't pretend to\nlike it.\"\n\nMajor Holt's expression did not change at all, but Joe had an odd\nfeeling that the major approved of him.\n\n\"Yes. That's right, Joe,\" his father added. \"You--you'll have to go\naloft once more, son. After that, we'll talk it over.\"\n\nSally hadn't said a word during the discussion, but she'd watched Joe\nevery second. Later, out on the porch of the major's quarters, she had a\ngreat deal to say. But that couldn't affect the facts.\n\nThe world at large, of course, received no inkling of the events in\npreparation. The Shed and the town of Bootstrap and all the desert for\na hundred-mile circle round about, were absolutely barred to all\nvisitors. Anybody who came into that circle stayed in. Most people were\nkept out. All that anyone outside could discover was that enormous\nquantities of cryptic material had poured and still were pouring into\nthe Shed. But this time security was genuinely tight. Educated guesses\ncould be made, and they were made; but nobody outside the closed-in area\nsave a very few top-ranking officials had any real knowledge. The world\nonly knew that something drastic and remarkable was in prospect.\n\nMike, though, was able to write a letter to the girl who'd written him.\nMajor Holt arranged it. Mike wrote his letter on paper supplied by\nSecurity, with ink supplied by Security, and while watched by Security\nofficers. His letter was censored by Major Holt himself, and it did not\nreveal that Mike was back on Earth. But it did invite a reply--and Mike\nsweated as he waited for one.\n\nThe others had plenty to sweat about. Joe and Haney and the Chief were\nacting as instructors to the Moonship's crew. They taught practical\nspace navigation. At first they thought they hadn't much to pass on, but\nthey found out otherwise. They had to pass on data on everything from\nhow to walk to how to drink coffee, how to eat, sleep, why one should\nwear gravity harness, and the manners and customs of ships in space.\nThey had to show why in space fighting a ship might send missiles on\nbefore it, but would really expect to do damage with those it left\nbehind. They had to warn of the dangers of unshielded sunshine, and the\nequal danger of standing in shadow for more than five minutes, and----\n\nThey had material for six months of instruction courses, but there was\nbarely a week to pass it on. Joe was run ragged, but in spite of\neverything he managed to talk at some length with Sally. He found\nhimself curiously anxious to discuss any number of things with his\nfather, too, who suddenly appeared to be much more intelligent than Joe\nhad ever noticed before.\n\nHe was almost unhappy when it was certain that the Moonship would take\noff for space on the following day. He talked about it with Sally the\nnight before take-off.\n\n\"Look,\" he said awkwardly. \"As far as I'm concerned this has turned out\na pretty sickly business. But when we have got a base on the Moon, it'll\nbe a good job done. There will be one thing that nobody can stop!\nEverybody's been living in terror of war. If we hold the Moon the cold\nwar will be ended. You can't kick on my wanting to help end that!\"\n\nSally smiled at him in the moonlight.\n\n\"And--meanwhile,\" said Joe clumsily, \"well--when I come back we can do\nsome serious talking about--well--careers and such things. Until\nthen--no use. Right?\"\n\nSally's smile wavered. \"Very sensible,\" she agreed wrily. \"And awfully\nsilly, Joe. I know what kind of a career I want! What other fascinating\ntopic do you know to talk about, Joe?\"\n\n\"I don't know of any. Oh, yes! Mike got a letter from his girl. I don't\nknow what she said, but he's walking on air.\"\n\n\"But it isn't funny!\" said Sally indignantly. \"Mike's a person! A fine\nperson! If he'll let me, I'll write to his girl myself and--try to make\nfriends with her so when you come back I--maybe I can be a sort of\nmatch-maker.\"\n\n\"That, I like!\" Joe said warmly. \"You're swell sometimes, Sally!\"\n\nSally looked at him enigmatically in the moonlight.\n\n\"There are times when it seems to escape your attention,\" she observed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe next morning she cried a little when he left her, to climb in the\nspace tug which was so small a part of today's activity. Joe and his\ncrew were the only living men who had ever made a round trip to the\nPlatform and back. But now there was the Moonship to go farther than\nthey'd been allowed. It was even clumsier in design than the Platform,\nthough it was smaller. But it wasn't designed to stay in space. It was\nto rest on the powdery floor of a ring-mountain's central plain.\n\nLet it get off into space, and somehow get to the Platform to reload.\nThen let it replace the rockets it would burn in this take-off and it\ncould go on out to emptiness. It would make history as the first\nserious attempt by human beings to reach the Moon.\n\nJoe and his followers would go along simply to handle guided missiles if\nit came to a fight, and to tow the Moonship to its wharf--the\nPlatform--and out into midstream again when it resumed its journey. And\nthat was all.\n\nThe Moonship lifted from the floor of the Shed to the sound of hundreds\nof pushpot engines.\n\nThen the space tug roared skyward. Her take-off rockets here substituted\nfor the pushpots. Her second-stage rockets were also of the nonpoisonous\nvariety, because she fired them at a bare 60,000 feet. They were\nsubstitutes for the jatos the pushpots carried.\n\nShe was out in space when the third-stage rockets roared dully outside\nher hull.\n\nWhen the Moonship crossed the west coast of Africa, the space tug was\n400 miles below and 500 miles behind. When the Moonship crossed Arabia,\nthe difference was 200 miles vertically and less than 100 in line.\n\nThen the Moonship released small objects, steadied by gyroscopes and\nflung away by puffs of compressed air. The small objects spread out.\nHaney and Mike and the Chief had reloaded the firing racks from inside\nthe ship, and now were intent upon control boards and radar. They\npressed buttons. One by one, little puffs of smoke appeared in space.\nThey had armed the little space missiles, setting off tiny flares which\nhad no function except to prove that each missile was ready for use.\n\nBy the time the two space craft floated toward India, above an area from\nwhich war rockets had been known to rise, there were more little weapons\nfloating with them. One screen of missiles hurtled on before the space\ntug, and another behind. Anything that came up from Earth would\ninstantly be attacked by dozens of midget ships bent upon suicide.\n\nRadar probed the space formation, but enemies of the fleet and the\nPlatform very wisely did no more than probe. The Moonship and its\nattendants went across the Pacific, still rising. Above the longitude of\nWashington, the space tug left its former post and climbed, nudging the\nMoonship this way and that. And from behind, the Platform came floating\nsplendidly.\n\nTiny figures in space suits extended the incredibly straight lines which\nwere plastic hoses filled with air. Very, very gently indeed, the great,\nbulbous Platform and the squat, flat Moonship came together and touched.\nThey moored in contact.\n\nAnd then the inert small missiles that had floated below, all the way\nup, flared simultaneously. Their rockets emitted smoke. In fine\nalignment, they plunged forward through emptiness, swerved with a\nremarkable precision, and headed out for emptiness beyond the Platform's\norbit. Their function had been to protect the Moonship on its way out.\nThat function was performed. There were too many of them to recover, so\nthey went out toward the stars.\n\nWhen their rockets burned out they vanished. But a good hour later, when\nit was considered that they were as far out as they were likely to go,\nthey began to blow up. Specks of flame, like the tiniest of new stars,\nflickered against the background of space.\n\nBut Joe and the others were in the Platform by then. They'd brought up\nmail for the crew. And they were back on duty.\n\nThe Platform seemed strange with the Moonship's crew aboard. It had been\na gigantic artificial world with very few inhabitants. With twenty-five\nnaval ratings about, plus the four of its regular crew, plus the space\ntug's complement, it seemed excessively crowded.\n\nAnd it was busy. There were twenty-five new men to be guided as they\napplied what they'd been taught aground about life in space. It was\nthree full Earthdays before the stores intended for the journey to the\nMoon and the maintenance of a base there really began to move. The tug\nand the space wagons had to be moored outside and reached only by space\nsuits through small personnel airlocks.\n\nAnd there was the matter of discipline. Lieutenant Commander Brown had\nbeen put in command of the Platform for experience in space. He was\nconsidered to be prepared for command of the Moonship by that\nexperience. So now he turned over command of the Platform to Brent--he\nmade a neat ceremony of it--and took over the ship that would go out to\nthe Moon. He made another ceremony out of that.\n\nIn command of the Moonship, his manner to Joe was absolutely correct. He\nfollowed regulations to the letter--to a degree that left Joe blankly\nuncomprehending. But he wouldn't have gotten along in the Navy if he\nhadn't. He'd tried to do the same thing in the Platform, and it wasn't\npractical. But he ignored all differences between Joe and himself. He\nmade no overtures of friendship, but that was natural. Unintentionally,\nJoe had defied him. He now deliberately overlooked all that, and Joe\napproved of him--within limits.\n\nBut Mike and Haney and the Chief did not. They laid for him. And they\nconsidered that they got him. When he took over the Moonship, Lieutenant\nCommander Brown naturally maintained naval discipline and required\nsnappy, official naval salutes on all suitable occasions, even in the\nPlatform. And Joe's gang privately tipped off the noncommissioned\npersonnel of the Moonship. Thereafter, no enlisted man ever saluted\nLieutenant Brown without first gently detaching his magnet-soled shoes\nfrom the floor. When a man was free, a really snappy salute gave a\ndiverting result. The man's body tilted forward to meet his rising arm,\nthe upward impetus was one-sided, and every man who saluted Brown\nimmediately made a spectacular kowtow which left him rigidly at salute\nfloating somewhere overhead with his back to Lieutenant Brown. With a\nlittle practice, it was possible to add a somersault to the other\nfeatures. On one historic occasion, Brown walked clanking into a\nstoreroom where a dozen men were preparing supplies for transfer to the\nMoonship. A voice cried, \"Shun!\" And instantly twelve men went floating\nsplendidly about the storeroom, turning leisurely somersaults, all\nrigidly at salute, and all wearing regulation poker faces.\n\nAn order abolishing salutes in weightlessness followed shortly after.\n\nIt took four days to get the transfer of supplies properly started. It\ntook eight to finish the job. Affixing fresh rockets to the outside of\nthe Moonship's hull alone called for long hours in space suits. During\nthis time Mike floated nearby in a space wagon. One of the Navy men was\na trifle overcourageous. He affected to despise safety lines. Completing\nthe hook-on of a landing rocket, he straightened up too abruptly and\nwent floating off toward the Milky Way.\n\nMike brought him back. After that there was less trouble.\n\nEven so, the Moonship and the Platform were linked together for thirteen\nfull days, during which the Platform seemed extraordinarily crowded. On\nthe fourteenth day the two ships sealed off and separated. Joe and his\ncrew in the space tug hauled the Moonship a good five miles from the\nPlatform.\n\nThe space tug returned to the Platform. A blinker signal came across the\nfive-mile interval. It was a very crisp, formal, Navy-like message.\n\nThen the newly-affixed rockets on the Moonship's hull spurted their\nfumes. The big ship began to move. Not outward from Earth, of course.\nThat was where it was going. But it had the Platform's 12,000 miles per\nhour of orbital speed. If the bonds of gravitation could have been\nsnapped at just the proper instant, that speed alone would have carried\nthe Moonship all the way to its destination. But they couldn't. So the\nMoonship blasted to increase its orbital speed. It would swing out and\nout, and as the Earth's pull grew weaker with distance the same weight\nof rockets would move the same mass farther and farther toward the Moon.\nThe Moonship's course would be a sort of slowly flattening curve,\nreceding from Earth and becoming almost a straight line where Earth's\nand the Moon's gravitational fields cancelled each other.\n\nFrom there, the Moonship would have only to brake its fall against a\ngravity one-sixth that of Earth, and reaching out a vastly shorter\ndistance.\n\nJoe and the others watched the roiling masses of rocket fumes as the\nship seemed to grow infinitely small.\n\n\"We should've been in that ship,\" said Haney heavily when the naked eye\ncould no longer pick it out. \"We could've beat her to the Moon!\"\n\nJoe said nothing. He ached a little inside. But he reflected that the\nmen who'd guided the Platform to its orbit had been overshadowed by\nhimself and Haney and the Chief and Mike. A later achievement always\nmakes an earlier one look small. Now the four of them would be\nforgotten. History would remember the commander of the Moonship.\n\nForgotten? Yes, perhaps. But the names of the four of them, Joe and\nHaney and the Chief and Mike, would still be remembered in a language\nJoe couldn't speak, in a small village he couldn't name, on those\noccasions when the Mohawk tribe met in formal council.\n\nThe Chief grumbled. Mike stared out the port with bitter envy.\n\n\"It was a dirty trick,\" growled the Chief. \"We shoulda been part of the\nfirst gang ever to land on the Moon!\"\n\nJoe grimaced. His crew needed to be cured of feeling the same way he\ndid.\n\n\"I wouldn't say this outside of our gang,\" said Joe carefully, \"but if\nit hadn't been for us four that ship wouldn't be on the way at all.\nHaney figured the trick that got us back to Earth the first time, or\nelse we'd have been killed. If we had been killed, Mike wouldn't have\nfigured out the metal-concrete business. But for him, that Moonship\nwouldn't even be a gleam in anybody's eye. And if the Chief hadn't blown\nup that manned rocket we fought in the space wagons, there wouldn't be\nany Platform up here to reload and refuel the Moonship. So they left us\nbehind! But just among the four of us I think we can figure that if it\nhadn't been for us they couldn't have made it!\"\n\nHaney grinned slowly at Joe. The Chief regarded him with irony. Mike\nsaid, \"Yeah. Haney, and me, and the Chief. We did it all.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh,\" said the Chief sardonically. \"Us three. Just us three. Joe\ndidn't do anything. Just a bum, he is. We oughta tell Sally he's no good\nand she oughta pick herself out a guy that'll amount to something some\nday.\" He hit Joe between the shoulders. \"Sure! Just a bum, Joe! That's\nall! But we got a weakness for you. We'll let you hang around with us\njust the same! Come on, guys! Let's get something to eat!\"\n\nThe four of them marched down a steel-floored corridor, their\nmagnetic-soled shoes clanking on the plates. Their progress was\nuncertain and ungainly and altogether undignified. Suddenly the Chief\nbegan to bawl a completely irrelevant song to the effect that the\ninhabitants of the kingdom of Siam were never known to wash their\ndishes. Haney chimed in, and Mike. They were all very close together,\nand they were not at all impressive. But it hit Joe very hard, this\nsudden knowledge that the others didn't really care. It was the first\ntime it had occurred to him that Haney and Mike and the Chief would\nrather be left behind with him, as a gang, than go on to individual high\nachievement in a first landing on the Moon.\n\nIt felt good. It felt _real_ good.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut that, and all other sources of satisfaction, was wiped out by news\nthat came back from the Moonship a bare six hours later.\n\nThe Moonship was in trouble. The sequence and timing of its rocket\nblasts were worked out on Earth, and checked by visual and radar\nobservation. The computations were done by electronic brains the\nMoonship could not possibly have carried. And everything worked out. The\nship was on course and its firings were on schedule.\n\nBut then the unexpected happened. It was an error which no machine could\never have predicted, for which statistics and computations could never\nhave compensated. It was a _human_ error. At the signal for the final\nacceleration blast, the pilot of the Moonship had fired the wrong set of\nrockets.\n\nInexperience, stupidity, negligence, excitement--the reason didn't\nmatter. After years of planning and working and dreaming, one human\nfinger had made a mistake. And the mistake was fatal!\n\nWhen the mistake was realized, they'd had sense enough to cut loose the\nstill-firing rockets. But the damage had been done. The ship was still\nplunging on. It would reach the Moon. But it wouldn't land in\nAristarchus crater as planned. It would crash. If every rocket remaining\nmounted on the hull were to be fired at the best possible instant, the\nMoonship would hit near Copernicus, and it would land with a terminal\nvelocity of 800 feet per second--540 miles an hour.\n\nIt could even be calculated that when the Moonship landed, the explosion\nought to be visible from Earth with a fairly good telescope. It was due\nto take place in thirty-two hours plus or minus a few minutes.\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\nThe others got the space tug into the platform's lock and did things to\nit, in the way of loading, that its designers never intended, while Joe\nwas calling Earth for calculations. The result was infuriating. The\nMoonship had taken off for the Moon on the other side of the Platform's\norbit, when it had a velocity of more than 12,000 miles an hour in the\ndirection it wished to go. The Platform and of course the space tug was\nnow on the reverse side of the Platform's orbit. And of course they now\nhad a velocity of more than 12,000 miles per hour away from the\ndirection in which it was urgently necessary for the space tug to go.\nThey could wait for two hours to take off, said Earth, or waste the time\nand fuel they'd need to throw away to duplicate the effect of waiting.\n\n\"But we can't wait!\" raged Joe. Then he snapped. \"Look here! Suppose we\ntake off from here, dive at Earth, make a near-graze, and let its\ngravity curve our course! Like a cometary path! Figure that! That's what\nwe've got to do!\"\n\nHe kicked off his magnetic-soled shoes and went diving down to the\nairlock. Over his shoulder he panted an order for the radar-duty man to\nrelay anything from Earth down to him there. He arrived to find Haney\nand Mike in hot argument over whether it was possible to load on an\nextra ton or two of mass. He stopped it. They would.\n\n\"Everything's loaded?\" he demanded. \"Okay! Space suits! All set? Let's\nget out of this lock and start blasting!\"\n\nHe drove them into the space tug. He climbed in himself. He closed the\nentrance port. The plastic walls of the lock bulged out, pulled back\nfast, and the steering rockets jetted. The space tug came out of the\nlock. It spun about. It aimed for Earth and monstrous bursts of\nrocket-trail spread out behind it. It dived.\n\nNaturally! When a ship from the Platform wanted to reach Earth for\natmosphere-deceleration, it was more economical to head away from it.\nNow that it was the most urgent of all possible necessities to get away\nfrom Earth, in the opposite direction to the space tug's present motion,\nit was logical to dive toward it. The ship would plunge toward Earth,\nand Earth's gravity would help its rockets in the attainment of frenzied\nspeed. But the tug still possessed its orbital speed. So it would not\nactually strike the Earth, but would be carried eastward past its disk,\neven though aimed for Earth's mid-bulge. Yet Earth would continue to\npull. As the space tug skimmed past, its path would be curved by the\npull of gravity. At the nearest possible approach to Earth, the tug\nwould fire its heaviest rockets for maximum acceleration. And it would\nswing around Earth's atmosphere perhaps no more than 500 miles\nhigh--just barely beyond the measurable presence of air--and come out of\nthat crazy curve a good hour ahead of the Platform for a corresponding\nposition, and with a greater velocity than could be had in any other\nway. Traced on paper, the course of the tug would be a tight parabola.\n\nThe ship dived. And it happened that it had left the Platform and\nplunged deep in Earth's shadow, so that the look and feel of things was\nthat of an utterly suicidal plunge into oblivion. There was the seeming\nof a vast sack of pure blackness before the nose of the space tug. She\nstarted for it at four gravities acceleration, and Joe got his\nheadphones to his ears and lay panting while he waited for the figures\nand information he had to have.\n\nHe got them. When the four-gravity rockets burned out, the tug's crew\npainstakingly adjusted the ship's nose to a certain position. They flung\nthemselves back into the acceleration chairs and Joe fired a six-g\nblast. They came out of that, and he fired another. The three blasts\ngave the ship a downward speed of a mile and a half a second, and\nEarth's pull added to it steadily. The Earth itself was drawing them\ndown most of a 4,000-mile fall, which added to the speed their rockets\nbuilt up.\n\nDown on Earth, radar-bowls wavered dizzily, hunting for them to feed\nthem observations of position and data for their guidance. Back on the\nPlatform, members of the crew feverishly made their own computations.\nWhen the four in the Space tug were half-way to Earth, they were\ntraveling faster than any humans had ever traveled before, relative to\nthe Earth or the Platform itself. When they were a thousand miles from\nEarth, it was certain they would clear its edge. Joe proposed and\nreceived an okay to fire a salvo of Mark Tens to speed the ship still\nmore. When they burned to the release-point and flashed away past the\nports, the Chief and Haney panted up from their chairs and made their\nway aft.\n\n\"Going to reload the firing-frames,\" gasped the Chief.\n\nThey vanished. The space tug could take rockets from its cargo and set\nthem outside its hull for firing. No other ship could.\n\nHaney and the Chief came back. There was dead silence in the ship, save\nfor a small, tinny voice in Joe's headphones.\n\n\"We'll pass Earth 600 miles high,\" said Joe in a flat voice. \"Maybe\ncloser. I'm going to try to make it 450. We'll be smack over enemy\nterritory, but I doubt they could hit us. We'll be hitting better than\nsix miles a second. If we wanted to, we could spend some more rockets\nand hit escape velocity. But we want to stop, later. We'll ride it out.\"\n\nSilence. Stillness. Speed. Out the ports to Earthward there was purest\nblackness. On the other side, a universe of stars. But the blackness\ngrew and grew and grew until it neatly bisected the cosmos itself, and\nhalf of everything that was, was blackness. Half was tiny colored stars.\n\nThen there was a sound. A faint sound. It was a moan. It was a howl. It\nwas a shriek.... And then it was a mere thin moan again. Then it was\nnot.\n\n\"We touched air,\" said Joe calmly, \"at six and a quarter miles per\nsecond. Pretty thin, though. At that, we may have left a meteor-trail\nfor the populace to admire.\"\n\nNobody said anything at all. In a little while there was light ahead.\nThere was brightness. Instantly, it seemed, they were out of night and\nthere was a streaming tumult of clouds flashing past below--but they\nwere 800 miles up now--and Joe's headphones rattled and he said:\n\n\"Now we can give a touch of course-correction, and maybe a trace of\nspeed....\"\n\nRockets droned and boomed and roared outside the hull. The Earth fell\naway and away and presently it was behind. And they were plunging on\nafter the Moonship which was very, very, very far on before them.\n\nIt was actually many hours before they reached it. They couldn't afford\nto overtake it gradually, because they had to have time to work in after\ncontact. But overtaking it swiftly cost extra fuel, and they hadn't too\nmuch. So they compromised, and came up behind the Moonship at better\nthan 2,000 feet per second difference in speed--they approached it as\nfast as most rifle-bullets travel--and all creation was blotted out by\nthe fumes of the rockets they fired for deceleration.\n\nThen the space tug came cautiously close to the Moonship. Mike climbed\nout on the outside of the tug's hull, with the Chief also in space\nequipment, paying out Mike's safety-line. Mike leaped across two hundred\nyards of emptiness with light-years of gulf beneath him. His metal soles\nclanked on the Moonship's hull.\n\nThen the vision-screen on the tug lighted up. Lieutenant Commander Brown\nlooked out of it, quietly grim. Joe flicked on his own transmitter. He\nnodded.\n\n\"_Mr. Kenmore_,\" said Brown evenly, \"_I did not contact you before\nbecause I was not certain that contact could be made. How many\npassengers can you take back to the Platform?_\"\n\nJoe blinked at him.\n\n\"I haven't any idea,\" he said. \"But I'm going to hitch on and use our\nrockets to land you.\"\n\n\"_I do not think it practicable_,\" said Brown calmly. \"_I believe the\nonly result of such a course will be the loss of both ships with all\nhands. I will give you a written authorization to return on my order.\nBut since all my crew can't return, how many can you take? I have ten\nmarried men aboard. Six have children. Can you take six? Or all ten?_\"\nThen he said without a trace of emphasis, \"_Of course, none of them will\nbe officers._\"\n\n\"If I tried to turn back now, I think my crew would mutiny,\" Joe said\ncoldly. \"I'd hate to think they wouldn't, anyhow! We're going to hook on\nand play this out the way it lies!\"\n\nThere was a pause. Then Brown spoke again. \"_Mr. Kenmore, I was\nhoping you'd say that. Actually--er--not to be quoted, you\nunderstand--actually, intelligent defiance has always been in the\ntraditions of the Navy. Of course, you're not in the Navy, Kenmore, but\nright now it looks like the Navy is in your hands. Like a battleship in\nthe hands of a tug. Good luck, Kenmore._\"\n\nJoe flicked off the screen. \"You know,\" he said, winking at Mike, \"I\nguess Brown isn't such a bad egg after all. Let's go!\"\n\nIn minutes, the space tug had a line made fast. In half an hour, the two\nspace craft were bound firmly together, but far enough apart for the\nrocket blasts to dissipate before they reached the Moonship. Mike\nreturned to the tug. A pair of the big Mark Twenty rockets burned\nfrenziedly in emptiness.\n\nThe Moonship was slowed by a fraction of its speed. The deceleration was\nhardly perceptible.\n\nThere were more burnings. Back on Earth there were careful measurements.\nA tight beam tends to attenuate when it is thrown a hundred thousand\nmiles. It tends to! When speech is conducted over it, the lag between\ncomment and reply is perceptible. It's not great--just over half a\nsecond. But one notices it. That lag was used to measure the speed and\ndistance of the two craft. The prospect didn't look too good.\n\nThe space tug burned rocket after rocket after rocket. There was no\neffect that Joe could detect, of course. It would have been like\nnoticing the effect of single oar-strokes in a rowboat miles from shore.\nBut the instruments on Earth found a difference. They made very, very,\nvery careful computations. And the electronic brains did the\ncalculations which battalions of mathematicians would have needed years\nto work out. The electronic calculations which could not make a mistake\nsaid--that it was a toss-up.\n\nThe Moon came slowly to float before the two linked ships. It grew\nslowly, slowly larger. The word from Earth was that considering the\nrockets still available in the space tug, and those that should have\nbeen fired but weren't on the Moonship, there must be no more blasts\njust yet. The two ships must pass together through the neutral-point\nwhere the gravities of Earth and Moon exactly cancel out. They must fall\ntogether toward the Moon. Forty miles above the lunar surface\nsuch-and-such rockets were to be fired. At twenty miles, such-and-such\nothers. At five miles the Moonship itself must fire its remaining\nfuel-store. With luck, it was a toss-up. Safety or a smash.\n\nBut there was a long time to wait. Joe and his crew relaxed in the space\ntug. The Chief looked out a port and observed:\n\n\"I can see the ring-mountains now. Naked-eye stuff, too! I wonder if\nanybody ever saw that before!\"\n\n\"Not likely,\" said Joe.\n\nMike stared out a port. Haney looked, also.\n\n\"How're we going to get back, Joe?\"\n\n\"The Moonship has rockets on board,\" Joe told him. \"Only they can't\nstick them in the firing-racks outside. They're stowed away, all\nshipshape, Navy fashion. After we land, we'll ask politely for rockets\nto get back to the Platform with. It'll be a tedious run. Mostly\ncoasting--falling free. But we'll make it.\"\n\n\"If everything doesn't blow when we land,\" said the Chief.\n\nJoe said uncomfortably: \"It won't. Not that somebody won't try.\" Then he\nstopped. After a moment he said awkwardly: \"Look! It's necessary that we\nhumans get to the stars, or ultimately we'll crowd the Earth until we\nwon't be able to stay human. We'd have to have wars and plagues and such\nthings to keep our numbers down. It--it seems to me, and I--think it's\nbeen said before, that it looks like there's something, somewhere,\nthat's afraid of us humans. It doesn't want us to reach the stars. It\ndidn't want us to fly. Before that it didn't want us to learn how to\ncure disease, or have steam, or--anything that makes men different from\nthe beasts.\"\n\nHaney turned his head. He listened intently.\n\n\"Maybe it sounds--superstitious,\" said Joe uneasily, \"but there's always\nbeen somebody trying to smash everything the rest of us wanted. As\nif--as if something alien and hateful went around whispering\nhypnotically into men's ears while they slept, commanding them\nirresistibly to do things to smash all their own hopes.\"\n\nThe Chief grunted. \"Huh! D'you think that's new stuff, Joe?\"\n\n\"N-no,\" admitted Joe. \"But it's true. Something fights us. You can make\nwild guesses. Maybe--things on far planets that know that if ever we\nreach there.... There's something that hates men and it tries to make us\ndestroy ourselves.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said Haney mildly. \"I learned about that in Sunday School, Joe.\"\n\n\"Maybe I mean that,\" said Joe helplessly. \"But anyhow there's something\nwe fight--and there's Something that fights with us. So I think we're\ngoing to get the Moonship down all right.\"\n\nMike said sharply: \"You mean you think this is all worked out in\nadvance. That we'd be here, we'd get here----\"\n\nThe Chief said impatiently, \"It's figured out so we can do it if we got\nthe innards. We got the chance. We can duck it. But if we duck it, it's\nbad, and somebody else has to have the chance later. I know what Joe's\nsaying. Us men, we got to get to the stars. There's millions of 'em, and\nwe need the planets they've got swimming around 'em.\"\n\nHaney said, \"Some of them have planets. That's known. Yeah.\"\n\n\"Those planets ain't going to go on forever with nobody using 'em,\"\ngrunted the Chief. \"It don't make sense. And things in general do make\nsense. All but us humans,\" he finished with a grin. \"And I like us,\nanyhow. Joe's right. We'll get by this time. And if we don't--some other\nguys'll have to do the job of landing on the Moon. But it'll be\ndone--as a starter.\"\n\n\"I can see lots of mountains down there. Plain,\" Mike said quietly.\n\n\"What's the radar say?\"\n\nJoe looked. Back at the Platform it had shown the curve of the surface\nof Earth. Here a dim line was beginning to show on the vertical-plane\nscreen. It was the curve of the surface of the Moon.\n\n\"We might as well get set,\" said Joe. \"We've got time but we might as\nwell. Space suits on. I'll tighten up the chain. Steering rockets'll do\nthat. Then we'll take a last look. All firing racks loaded outside?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Haney. He grinned wrily. \"You know, Joe, I know what I\nknow, but still I'm scared.\"\n\n\"Me, too,\" said Joe.\n\nBut there were things to do. They took their places. They watched out\nthe ports. The Moon had seemed a vast round ball a little while back.\nNow it appeared to be flattening. Its edges still curved away beyond a\nsurprisingly nearby horizon. The ring-mountains were amazingly distinct.\nThere were incredibly wide, smooth spaces with mottled colorings. But\nthe mountains....\n\nWhen the ships were 40 miles high the space tug blasted valorously, and\nall the panorama of the Moon's surface was momentarily hidden by the\nracing clouds of mist. The rockets burned out.\n\nHaney and the Chief replaced the burned-out rockets. They were gigantic,\nheavy-bore tubes which they couldn't have stirred on Earth. Now they\nloaded them into the curious locks which conveyed them outside the hull\ninto firing position.\n\nThe ring-mountains were gigantic when they blasted again! They were only\n20 miles up, then, and some of the peaks rose four miles from their\ninner crater floors.\n\nThe ships were still descending fast. Joe spoke into his microphone.\n\n\"Calling Moonship! Calling----\" He stopped and said matter-of-factly,\n\"I suggest we fire our last blast together. Shall I give the word?\nRight!\"\n\nThe surface of the Moon came toward them. Craters, cracks, frozen\nfountains of stone, swelling undulations of ground interrupted without\nrhyme or reason by the gigantic splashings of missiles from the sky a\nhundred thousand million years ago. The colorings were unbelievable.\nThere were reds and browns and yellows. There were grays and dusty\ndeep-blues and streaks of completely impossible tints in combination.\n\nBut Joe couldn't watch that. He kept his eyes on a very special gadget\nwhich was a radar range-finder. He hadn't used it about the Platform\nbecause there were too many tin cans and such trivia floating about. It\nwouldn't be dependable. But it did measure the exact distance to the\nnearest solid object.\n\n\"Prepare for firing on a count of five,\" said Joe quietly. \"Five ...\nfour ... three ... two ... one ... fire!\"\n\nThe space tug's rockets blasted. For the first time since they overtook\nthe Moonship, the tug now had help. The remaining rockets outside the\nMoonship's hull blasted furiously. Out the ports there was nothing but\nhurtling whitenesses. The rockets droned and rumbled and roared....\n\nThe main rockets burned out. The steering rockets still boomed. Joe had\nthrown them on for what good their lift might do.\n\n\"Joe!\" said Haney in a surprised tone. \"I feel weight! Not much, but\nsome! And the main rockets are off!\"\n\nJoe nodded. He watched the instruments before him. He shifted a control,\nand the space tug swayed. It swayed over to the limit of the tow-chain\nit had fastened to the Moonship. Joe shifted his controls again.\n\nThere was a peculiar, gritty contact somewhere. Joe cut the steering\nrockets and it was possible to look out. There were more gritty noises.\nThe space tug settled a little and leaned a little. It was still. Then\nthere was no noise at all.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Joe. \"We've got some weight. We're on the Moon.\"\n\nThey went out of the ship in a peculiarly solemn procession. About them\nreared cliffs such as no man had ever looked on before save in dreams.\nAbove their heads hung a huge round greenish globe, with a white polar\nice-cap plainly visible. It hung in mid-sky and was four times the size\nof the Moon as seen from Earth. If one stood still and looked at it, it\nwould undoubtedly be seen to be revolving, once in some twenty-four\nhours.\n\nMike scuffled in the dust in which he walked. Nobody had emerged from\nthe Moonship yet. The four of them were literally the first human beings\never to set foot on the surface of the Moon. But none of them mentioned\nthe fact, though all were acutely aware of it. Mike kicked up dust. It\nrose in a curiously liquid-like fashion. There was no air to scatter it.\nIt settled deliberately back again.\n\nMike spoke with an odd constraint. \"No green cheese,\" he said absurdly.\n\n\"No,\" agreed Joe. \"Let's go over to the Moonship. It looks all right. It\ncouldn't have landed hard.\"\n\nThey went toward the bulk of the ship from Earth, which now was a base\nfor the military occupation of a globe with more land-area than all\nEarth's continents put together--but not a drop of water. The Moonship\nwas tilted slightly askew, but it was patently unharmed. There were\nfaces at every port in the hull.\n\nThe Chief stopped suddenly. A sizable boulder rose from the dust. The\nChief struck it smartly with his space-gloved hand.\n\n\"I'm counting coup on the Moon!\" he said zestfully \"Tie that, you guys!\"\n\nThen he joined the others on their way to the Moonship's main lock.\n\n\"Shall we knock?\" asked Mike humorously. \"I doubt they've got a\ndoor-bell!\"\n\nBut the lock-door was opening to admit them. They crowded inside.\n\nCommander Brown was waiting for them with an out-stretched hand. \"Glad\nto have you aboard.\" And there was a genuine smile creeping across his\nface.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJoe talked with careful distinctness into a microphone. His voice took a\nlittle over a second to reach its destination. Then there was a pause of\nthe same length before the first syllable of Sally's reply came to him\nfrom Earth.\n\n\"I've reported to your father,\" said Joe carefully, \"and the Moonship\nhas reported to the Navy. In a couple of hours Haney and the Chief and\nMike and I will be taking off to go back to the Platform. We got rockets\nfrom the stores of the Moonship.\"\n\nSally's voice was surprisingly clear. It wavered a little, but there was\nno sound of static to mar reception.\n\n\"Then what, Joe?\"\n\n\"I'm bringing written reports and photographs and first specimens of\ngeology from the Moon,\" Joe told her. \"I'm a mailman. It'll probably be\nsixty hours back to the Platform--free fall most of the way--and then\nwe'll refuel and I'll come down to Earth to deliver the reports and\nsuch.\"\n\nPause. One second and a little for his voice to go. Another second and\nsomething over for her voice to return.\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"That's what I'm trying to find out,\" said Joe. \"What day is today?\"\n\n\"Tuesday,\" said Sally after the inevitable pause. \"It's ten o'clock\nTuesday morning at the Shed.\"\n\nJoe made calculations in his mind. Then he said:\n\n\"I ought to land on Earth some time next Monday.\"\n\nPause.\n\n\"Yes?\" said Sally.\n\n\"I wondered,\" said Joe. \"How about a date that night?\" Another pause.\nThen Sally's voice. She sounded glad.\n\n\"It's a date, Joe. And--do you know, I must be the first girl in the\nworld to make a date with the Man in the Moon?\"\n\n\n\n\n     COMBAT MISSION!\n\n\n     _Joe Kenmore's mission was as dangerous as it sounded simple:_\n\n         \"DELIVER SUPPLIES AND ATOMIC WEAPONS TO THE SPACE PLATFORM.\n         THEN PREPARE FOR MAN'S FIRST EXPEDITION TO THE MOON.\"\n\n    Joe had helped launch the first Space Platform--that initial rung in\n    man's ladder to the stars. But the enemies who had ruthlessly tried\n    to destroy the space station before it left Earth were still at\n    work. They were plotting to stop Joe's mission!\n\n    Cover painting by Robert Schulz\n\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------+\n|                      Transcriber's Note                      |\n|                                                              |\n| The chemical symbol for carbon dioxide has been shown as     |\n| CO_2 to depict a subscript 2.                                |\n|                                                              |\n| In the following words, the hyphen has been removed to       |\n| conform to majority use in text.                             |\n|      brain-storm                                             |\n|      loud-speaker                                            |\n|                                                              |\n| The following words with and without a hyphen were left as   |\n| such because of equal prevalence of both forms:              |\n|     half-way     halfway                                     |\n|     pay-load     payload                                     |\n|     rocket-lift  rocketlift                                  |\n|     sun-lamps    sunlamps                                    |\n|     hand-hold    handhold                                    |\n|     pin-points   pinpoints                                   |\n|                                                              |\n| \"overall\" and \"over-all\" were left as such since the writers |\n| are different (The narrator and a character).                |\n|                                                              |\n| The following typos have been corrected:                     |\n|     Adorning     Adoring                                     |\n|     level        lever                                       |\n|     runing       running                                     |\n|     shed         Shed                                        |\n|     thiry-nine   thirty-nine                                 |\n|                                                              |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Space Tug, by Murray Leinster\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK SPACE TUG ***\n\n***** This file should be named 18719.txt or 18719.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/8/7/1/18719/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, LN Yaddanapudi and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n*** END: FULL LICENSE ***\n"}
