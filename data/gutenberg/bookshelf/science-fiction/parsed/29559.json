Its\n    title was \"The Lovers\" and since then he has gone right on proving\n    himself a top-hand craftsman._\n\n\n     they\n twinkled\n     like\n   jewels\n\n _by ... Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer_\n\n\n Crane didn't get the nice man's name--until it\n was far too late to do anything at all about it.\n\n\nJack Crane lay all morning in the vacant lot. Now and then he moved a\nlittle to quiet the protest of cramped muscles and stagnant blood, but\nmost of the time he was as motionless as the heap of rags he resembled.\nNot once did he hear or see a Bohas agent, or, for that matter, anyone.\nThe predawn darkness had hidden his panting flight from the transie\njungle, his dodging across backyards while whistles shrilled and voices\nshouted, and his crawling on hands and knees down an alley into the high\ngrass and bushes which fringed a hidden garden.\n\nFor a while his heart had knocked so loudly that he had been sure he\nwould not be able to hear his pursuers if they did get close. It seemed\ninevitable that they would track him down. A buddy had told him that a\nnew camp had just been built at a place only three hours drive away from\nthe town. This meant that Bohas would be thick as hornets in the\nneighborhood. But no black uniforms had so far appeared. And then, lying\nthere while the passionate and untiring sun mounted the sky, the\nbang-bang of his heart was replaced by a noiseless but painful movement\nin his stomach.\n\nHe munched a candy bar and two dried rolls which a housewife had given\nhim the evening before. The tiger in his belly quit pacing back and\nforth; it crouched and licked its chops, but its tail was stuck up in\nhis throat. Jack could feel the dry fur swabbing his pharynx and mouth.\nHe suffered, but he was used to that. Night would come as surely as\nanything did. He'd get a drink then to quench his thirst.\n\nBoredom began to sit on his eyelids. Just as he was about to accept some\nmuch needed sleep, he moved a leaf with an accidental jerk of his hand\nand uncovered a caterpillar. It was dark except for a row of yellow\nspots along the central line of some of its segments. As soon as it was\nexposed, it began slowly shimmying away. Before it had gone two feet, it\nwas crossed by a moving shadow. Guiding the shadow was a black wasp with\nan orange ring around the abdomen. It closed the gap between itself and\nthe worm with a swift, smooth movement and straddled the dark body.\n\nBefore the wasp could grasp the thick neck with its mandibles, the\nintended victim began rapidly rolling and unrolling and flinging itself\nfrom side to side. For a minute the delicate dancer above it could not\nsucceed in clenching the neck. Its sharp jaws slid off the frenziedly\njerking skin until the tiring creature paused for the chip of a second.\n\nSeizing opportunity and larva at the same time, the wasp stood high on\nits legs and pulled the worm's front end from the ground, exposing the\nyellowed band of the underpart. The attacker's abdomen curved beneath\nits own body; the stinger jabbed between two segments of the prey's\njointed length. Instantly, the writhing stilled. A shudder, and the\ncaterpillar became as inert as if it were dead.\n\nJack had watched with an eye not completely clinical, feeling the\nsympathy of the hunted and the hounded for a fellow. His own struggles\nof the past few months had been as desperate, though not as hopeless,\nand ...\n\nHe stopped thinking. His heart again took up the rib-thudding. Out of\nthe corner of his left eye he had seen a shadow that fell across the\ngarden. When he slowly turned his head to follow the stain upon the\nsun-splashed soil, he saw that it clung to a pair of shining black\nboots.\n\nJack did not say anything. What was the use? He put his hands against\nthe weeds and pushed his body up. He looked into the silent mouth of a\n.38 automatic. It told him his running days were over. You didn't talk\nback to a mouth like that.\n\n\nII\n\nJack was lucky. As one of the last to be herded into the truck, which\nhad been once used for hauling cattle, he had more room to breathe than\nmost of the others. He faced the rear bars. The vehicle was heading into\nthe sun. Its rays were not as hard on him as on some of those who were\nso jam-packed they could not turn to get the hot yellow splotch out of\ntheir eyes.\n\nHe looked through lowered lids at the youths on either side of him. For\nthe last three days in the transie jungle, the one standing on his left\nhad given signs of what was coming upon him, what had come upon so many\nof the transies. The muttering, the indifference to food, not hearing\nyou when you talked to him. And now the shock of being caught in the\nraid had speeded up what everybody had foreseen. He was hardened, like a\nconcrete statue, into a half-crouch. His arms were held in front of him\nlike a praying mantis', and his hands clutched a bar. Not even the\npressure of the crowd could break his posture.\n\nThe man on Jack's right murmured something, but the roaring of motor and\nclashing of gears shifting on a hill squashed his voice. He spoke\nlouder:\n\n\"_Cerea flexibilitas_. Extreme catatonic state. The fate of all of us.\"\n\n\"You're nuts,\" said Jack. \"Not me. I'm no schizo, and I'm not going to\nbecome one.\"\n\nAs there was no reply, Jack decided he had not moved his lips enough to\nbe heard clearly. Lately, even when it was quiet, people seemed to have\ntrouble making out what he was saying. It made him mildly angry.\n\nHe shouted. It did not matter if he were overheard. That any of the\nprisoners were agents of the Bureau of Health and Sanity didn't seem\nlikely. Anyway, he didn't care. They wouldn't do anything to him they\nhadn't planned before this.\n\n\"Got any idea where we're going?\"\n\n\"Sure. F.M.R.C. 3. Federal Male Rehabilitation Camp No. 3. I spent two\nweeks in the hills spying on it.\"\n\nJack looked the speaker over. Like all those in the truck, he wore a\nfrayed shirt, a stained and torn coat, and greasy, dirty trousers. The\nblack bristles on his face were long; the back of his neck was covered\nby thick curls. The brim of his dusty hat was pulled down low. Beneath\nits shadow his eyes roamed from side to side with the same fear that\nJack knew was in his own eyes.\n\nHunger and sleepless nights had knobbed his cheekbones and honed his\nchin to a sharp point. An almost visible air clung to him, a hot aura\nthat seemed to result from veins full of lava and eyeballs spilling out\na heat that could not be held within him. He had the face every transie\nhad, the face of a man who was either burning with fever or who had seen\na vision.\n\nJack looked away to stare miserably at the dust boiling up behind the\nwheels, as if he could see projected against its yellow-brown screen his\nretreating past.\n\nHe spoke out of the side of his mouth. \"What's happened to us? We should\nbe happy and working at good jobs and sure about the future. We\nshouldn't be just bums, hobos, walkers of the streets, rod-hoppers,\nbeggars, and thieves.\"\n\nHis friend shrugged and looked uneasily from the corners of his eyes. He\nwas probably expecting the question they all asked sooner or later: _Why\nare_ you _on the road?_ They asked, but none replied with words that\nmeant anything. They lied, and they didn't seem to take any pleasure in\ntheir lying. When they asked questions themselves, they knew they\nwouldn't get the truth. But something forced them to keep on trying\nanyway.\n\nJack's buddy evaded also. He said, \"I read a magazine article by a Dr.\nVespa, the head of the Bureau of Health and Sanity. He'd written the\narticle just after the President created the Bureau. He viewed, quote,\nwith alarm and apprehension, unquote, the fact that six percent of those\nbetween the ages of twelve and twenty-five were schizophrenics who\nneeded institutionalizing. And he was, quote, appalled and horrified,\nunquote, that five percent of the nation were homeless unemployed and\nthat three point seven percent of those were between the ages of\nfourteen and thirty. He said that if this schizophrenia kept on\nprogressing, half the world would be in rehabilitation camps. But if\nthat occurred, the sane half would go to pot. Back to the stone age. And\nthe schizos would die.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe licked his lips as if he were tasting the figures and found them\nbitter.\n\n\"I was very interested by Vespa's reply to a mother who had written\nhim,\" he went on. \"Her daughter ended up in a Bohas camp for schizos,\nand her son had left his wonderful home and brilliant future to become a\nbum. She wanted to know why. Vespa took six long paragraphs to give six\nexplanations, all equally valid and all advanced by equally\ndistinguished sociologists. He himself favored the mass hysteria theory.\nBut if you looked at his gobbledegook closely, you could reduce it to\none phrase, _We don't know_.\n\n\"He did say this--though you won't like it--that the schizos and the\ntransies were just two sides of the same coin. Both were infected with\nthe same disease, whatever it was. And the transies usually ended up as\nschizos anyway. It just took them longer.\"\n\nGears shifted. The floor slanted. Jack was shoved hard against the rear\nboards by the weight of the other men. He didn't answer until the\npressure had eased and his ribs were free to work for more than mere\nsurvival.\n\nHe said, \"You're way off, schizo. My hitting the road has nothing to do\nwith those split-heads. Nothing, you understand? There's nothing foggy\nor dreamy about me. I wouldn't be here with you guys if I hadn't been so\ninterested in a wasp catching a caterpillar that I never saw the Bohas\nsneaking up on me.\"\n\nWhile Jack described the little tragedy, the other allowed an\nunderstanding smile to bend his lips. He seemed engrossed, however, and\nwhen Jack had finished, he said:\n\n\"That was probably an ammophila wasp. _Sphex urnaria_ Klug. Lovely, but\nvicious, little she-demon. Injects the poison from her sting into the\ncaterpillar's central nerve cord. That not only paralyzes but preserves\nit. The victim is always stowed away with another one in an underground\nburrow. The wasp attaches one of her eggs to the body of a worm. When\nthe egg hatches, the grub eats both of the worms. They're alive, but\nthey're completely helpless to resist while their guts are gnawed away.\nBeautiful idea, isn't it?\n\n\"It's a habit common to many of those little devils: _Sceliphron\ncementarium_, _Eumenes coarcta_, _Eumenes fraterna_, _Bembix spinolae_,\n_Pelopoeus_ ...\"\n\nJack's interest wandered. His informant was evidently one of those\ntransies who spent long hours in the libraries. They were ready at the\nslightest chance to offer their encyclopaedic but often useless\nknowledge. Jack himself had abandoned his childhood bookwormishness. For\nthe last three years his days and evenings had worn themselves out on\nthe streets, passed in a parade of faces, flickered by in plate-glass\nwindows of restaurants and department stores and business offices, while\nhe hoped, hoped....\n\n\"Did you say you spied on the camp?\" Jack interrupted the sonorous,\nalmost chanting flow of Greek and Latin.\n\n\"Huh? Oh, yeah. For two weeks. I saw plenty of transies trucked in, but\nI never saw any taken out. Maybe they left in the rocket.\"\n\n\"Rocket?\"\n\nThe youth was looking straight before him. His face was hard as bone,\nbut his voice trembled.\n\n\"Yes. A big one. It landed and discharged about a dozen men.\"\n\n\"You nuts? There's been only one man-carrying rocket invented, and it\nlands by parachute.\"\n\n\"I saw it, I tell you. And I'm not so nutty I'm seeing things that\naren't there. Not yet, anyway!\"\n\n\"Maybe the government's got rockets it's not telling anybody about.\"\n\n\"Then what connection could there be between rehabilitation camps and\nrockets?\"\n\nJack shrugged and said, \"Your rocket story is fantastic.\"\n\n\"If somebody had told you four years ago that you'd be a bum hauled off\nto a concentration camp, you'd have said that was fantastic too.\"\n\nJack did not have time to reply. The truck stopped outside a high,\nbarbed wire fence. The gate swung open; the truck bounced down the bumpy\ndirt road. Jack saw some black-uniformed Bohas seated by heavy machine\nguns. They halted at another entrance; more barbed wire was passed. Huge\nDobermann pinschers looked at the transies with cold, steady eyes. The\ndust of another section of road swirled up before they squeaked to a\nstandstill and the engine turned off.\n\nThis time, agents began to let down the back of the truck. They had to\npry the pitiful schizo's fingers loose from the wood with a crow-bar and\ncarry him off, still in his half-crouch.\n\nA sergeant boomed orders. Stiff and stumbling, the transies jumped off\nthe truck. They were swiftly lined up into squads and marched into the\nenclosure and from there into a huge black barracks. Within an hour each\nman was stripped, had his head shaven, was showered, given a grey\nuniform, and handed a tin plate and spoon and cup filled with beans and\nbread and hot coffee.\n\nAfterwards, Jack wandered around, free to look at the sandy soil\nunderfoot and barbed wire and the black uniforms of the sentries, and\nfree to ask himself where, where, wherewherewhere? Twelve years ago it\nhad been, but where, where, where, was...?\n\n\nIII\n\nHow easy it would have been to miss all this, if only he had obeyed his\nfather. But Mr. Crane was so ineffectual....\n\n\"Jackie,\" he had said, \"would you please go outside and play, or stay in\nsome other room. It's very difficult to discuss business while you're\nwhooping and screaming around, and I have a lot to discuss with Mr.--\"\n\n\"Yes, Daddy,\" Jack said before his father mentioned his visitor's name.\nBut he was not Jack Crane in his game; he was Uncas. The big chairs and\nthe divan were trees in his imaginative eyes. The huge easy chair in\nwhich Daddy's caller (Jack thought of him only as \"Mister\") sat was a\nfallen log. He, Uncas, meant to hide behind it in ambush.\n\nMister did not bother him. He had smiled and said in a shrill voice that\nhe thought Jack was a very nice boy. He wore a light grey-green Palm\nBeach suit and carried a big brown leather briefcase that looked too\nheavy for his soda straw-thin legs and arms. He was queer-looking\nbecause his waist was so narrow and his back so humped. And when he took\noff his tan Panama hat, a white fuzz exploded from his scalp. His face\nwas pale as the moon in daylight. His broad smile showed teeth that Jack\nknew were false.\n\nBut the queerest thing about him was his thick spectacles, so heavily\ntinted with rose that Jack could not see the eyes behind them. The\nafternoon light seemed to bounce off the lenses in such a manner that no\nmatter what angle you looked at them, you could not pierce them. And\nthey curved to hide the sides of his eyes completely.\n\nMister had explained that he was an albino, and he needed the glasses to\ndim the glare on his eyes. Jack stopped being Uncas for a minute to\nlisten. He had never seen an albino before, and, indeed, he did not know\nwhat one was.\n\n\"I don't mind the youngster,\" said Mister. \"Let him play here if he\nwants to. He's developing his imagination, and he may be finding more\nstimuli in this front room than he could in all of outdoors. We should\nnever cripple the fine gift of imagination in the young. Imagination,\nfancy, fantasy--or whatever you call it--is the essence and mainspring\nof those scientists, musicians, painters, and poets who amount to\nsomething in later life. They are adults who have remained youths.\"\n\nMister addressed Jack, \"You're the Last of the Mohicans, and you're\nabout to sneak up on the French captain and tomahawk him, aren't you?\"\n\nJack blinked. He nodded his head. The opaque rose lenses set in Mister's\nface seemed to open a door into his naked grey skull.\n\nThe man said, \"I want you to listen to me, Jack. You'll forget my name,\nwhich isn't important. But you will always remember me and my visit,\nwon't you?\"\n\nJack stared at the impenetrable lenses and nodded dumbly.\n\nMister turned to Jack's father. \"Let his fancy grow. It is a necessary\nwish-fulfillment play. Like all human young who are good for anything at\nall, he is trying to find the lost door to the Garden of Eden. The\nhistory of the great poets and men-of-action is the history of the\nattempt to return to the realm that Adam lost, the forgotten Hesperides\nof the mind, the Avalon buried in our soul.\"\n\nMr. Crane put his fingertips together. \"Yes?\"\n\n\"Personally, I think that some day man will realize just what he is\nsearching for and will invent a machine that will enable the child to\nproject, just as a film throws an image on a screen, the visions in his\npsyche.\n\n\"I see you're interested,\" he continued. \"You would be, naturally, since\nyou're a professor of philosophy. Now, let's call the toy a\nspecterscope, because through it the subject sees the spectres that\nhaunt his unconscious. Ha! Ha! But how does it work? If you'll keep it\nto yourself, Mr. Crane, I'll tell you something: My native country's\nscientists have developed a rather simple device, though they haven't\npublished anything about it in the scientific journals. Let me give you\na brief explanation: Light strikes the retina of the eye; the rods and\ncones pass on impulses to the bipolar cells, which send them on to the\noptic nerve, which goes to the brain ...\"\n\n\"Elementary and full of gaps,\" said Jack's father.\n\n\"Pardon me,\" said Mister. \"A bare outline should be enough. You'll be\nable to fill in the details. Very well. This specterscope breaks up the\nlight going into the eye in such a manner that the rods and cones\nreceive only a certain wavelength. I can't tell you what it is, except\nthat it's in the visual red. The scope also concentrates like a\nburning-glass and magnifies the power of the light.\n\n\"Result? A hitherto-undiscovered chemical in the visual purple of the\nrods is activated and stimulates the optic nerve in a way we had not\nguessed possible. An electrochemical stimulus then irritates the\nsubconscious until it fully wakes up.\n\n\"Let me put it this way. The subconscious is not a matter of location\nbut of organization. There are billions of possible connections between\nthe neurons of the cortex. Look at those potentialities as so many cards\nin the same pack. Shuffle the cards one way and you have the common\nworkaday _cogito, ergo sum_ mind. Reshuffle them, and, bingo! you have\nthe combination of neurons, or cards, of the unconscious. The\nspecterscope does the redealing. When the subject gazes through it, he\nsees for the first time the full impact and result of his underground\nmind's workings in other perspectives than dreams or symbolical\nbehavior. The subjective Garden of Eden is resurrected. It is my\ncontention that this specterscope will some day be available to all\nchildren.\n\n\"When that happens, Mr. Crane, you will understand that the world will\nprofit from man's secret wishes. Earth will be a far better place.\nParadise, sunken deep in every man, can be dredged out and set up\nagain.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Jack's father, stroking his chin thoughtfully with\na finger. \"Children like my son are too introverted as it is. Give them\nthis psychological toy you suggest, and you would watch them grow, not\ninto the outside world, but into themselves. They would fester. Man has\nbeen expelled from the Garden. His history is a long, painful climb\ntoward something different. It is something that is probably better than\nthe soft and flabby Golden Age. If man were to return, he would regress,\nbecome worse than static, become infantile or even embryonic. He would\nbe smothered in the folds of his own dreams.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said the salesman. \"But I think you have a very unusual child\nhere. He will go much farther than you may think. Why? Because he is\nsensitive and has an imagination that only needs the proper guidance.\nToo many children become mere bourgeois ciphers with paunches and round\n'O' minds full of tripe. They'll stay on earth. That is, I mean they'll\nbe stuck in the mud.\"\n\n\"You talk like no insurance salesman I've ever met.\"\n\n\"Like all those who really want to sell, I'm a born psychologist,\"\nMister shrilled. \"Actually, I have an advantage. I have a Ph.D. in\npsychology. I would prefer staying at home for laboratory work, but\nsince I can help my starving children--I am not joking--so much more by\ncoming to a foreign land and working at something that will put food in\ntheir mouths, I do it. I can't stand to see my little ones go hungry.\nMoreover,\" he said with a wave of his long-fingered hand, \"this whole\nplanet is really a lab that beats anything within four walls.\"\n\n\"You spoke of famine. Your accent--your name. You're a Greek, aren't\nyou?\"\n\n\"In a way,\" said Mister. \"My name, translated, means gracious or kindly\nor well-meaning.\" His voice became brisker. \"The translation is apropos.\nI'm here to do you a service. Now, about these monthly premiums ...\"\n\nJack shook himself and stepped out of the mold of fascination that\nMister's glasses seemed to have poured around him. Uncas again, he\ncrawled on all fours from chair to divan to stool to the fallen log\nwhich the adults thought was an easy chair. He stuck his head from\nbehind it and sighted along the broomstick-musket at his father. He'd\nshoot that white man dead and then take his scalp. He giggled at that,\nbecause his father really didn't have any hairlock to take.\n\nAt that moment Mister decided to take off his specs and polish them with\nhis breast-pocket handkerchief. While he answered one of Mr. Crane's\nquestions, he let them dangle from his fingers. Accidentally, the lenses\nwere level with Jack's gaze. One careless glance was enough to jerk his\neyes back to them. One glance stunned him so that he could not at once\nunderstand that what he was seeing was not reality.\n\nThere was his father across the room. But it wasn't a room. It was a\nspace outdoors under the low branch of a tree whose trunk was so big it\nwas as wide as the wall had been. Nor was the Persian rug there. It was\nreplaced by a close-cropped bright green grass. Here and there foot-high\nflowers with bright yellow petals tipped in scarlet swayed beneath an\ninternal wind. Close to Mr. Crane's feet a white horse no larger than a\nfox terrier bit off the flaming end of a plant.\n\nAll those things were wonderful enough--but was that naked giant who\nsprawled upon a moss-covered boulder father? No! Yes! Though the\nfeatures were no longer pinched and scored and pale, though they were\nglowing and tanned and smooth like a young athlete's they were his\nfather's! Even the thick, curly hair that fell down over a wide forehead\nand the panther-muscled body could not hide his identity.\n\nThough it tore at his nerves, and though he was afraid that once he\nlooked away he would never again seize the vision, Jack ripped his gaze\naway from the rosy view.\n\nThe descent to the grey and rasping reality was so painful that tears\nran down his cheeks, and he gasped as if struck in the pit of the\nstomach. How could beauty like that be all around him without his\nknowing it?\n\nHe felt that he had been blind all his life until this moment and would\nbe forever eyeless again, an unbearable forever, if he did not look\nthrough the glass again.\n\nHe stole another hurried glance, and the pain in his heart and stomach\nwent away, his insides became wrapped in a soft wind. He was lifted. He\nwas floating, a pale red, velvety air caressed him and buoyed him.\n\nHe saw his mother run from around the tree. That should have seemed\npeculiar, because he had thought she was dead. But there she was, no\nlonger flat-walking and coughing and thin and wax-skinned, but\ngolden-brown and curvy and bouncy. She jumped at Daddy and gave him a\nlong kiss. Daddy didn't seem to mind that she had no clothes on. Oh, it\nwas so wonderful. Jack was drifting on a yielding and wine-tinted air\nand warmed with a wind that seemed to swell him out like a happy\nballoon....\n\nSuddenly he was falling, hurtling helplessly and sickeningly through a\nvoid while a cold and drab blast gouged his skin and spun him around and\naround. The world he had always known shoved hard against him. Again he\nfelt the blow in the solar plexus and saw the grey tentacles of the\nliving reality reach for his heart.\n\nJack looked up at the stranger, who was just about to put his spectacles\non the bridge of his long nose. His eyelids were closed. Jack never did\nsee the pink eyes.\n\nThat didn't bother him. He had other things to think about. He crouched\nbeside the chair while his brain tried to move again, tried to engulf a\nthought and failed because it could not become fluid enough to find the\nidea that would move his tongue to shriek, _No! No! No!_\n\nAnd when the salesman rose and placed his papers in his case and patted\nJack on the head and bent his opaque rose spectacles at him and said\ngood-by and that he wouldn't be coming back because he was going out of\ntown to stay, Jack was not able to move or say a thing. Nor for a long\ntime after the door had closed could he break through the mass that\ngripped him like hardened lava. By then, no amount of screams and\nweeping would bring Mister back. All his father could do was to call a\ndoctor who took the boy's temperature and gave him some pills.\n\n\nIV\n\nJack stood inside the wire and bent his neck back to watch a huge black\nand silver oyster feel the dusk for a landing-field with its single\nwhite foot and its orange toes. Blindingly, lights sprang to attention\nover the camp.\n\nWhen Jack had blinked his eyes back to normal, he could see over the\nflat half-mile between the fence and the ship. It lay quiet and\nglittering and smoking in the flood-beams. He could see the round door\nin its side swing open. Men began filing out. A truck rumbled across the\nplain and pulled up beside the metal bulk. A very tall man stepped out\nof the cab and halted upon the running board, from which he seemed to be\ngreeting the newcomers or giving them instructions. Whatever he was\nsaying took so long that Jack lost interest.\n\nLately, he had not been able to focus his mind for any length of time\nupon anything except that one event in the past. He wandered around and\nwhipped glances at his comrades' faces, noting listlessly that their\nuniforms and shaved heads had improved their appearance. But nothing\nwould be able to chill the feverishness of their eyes.\n\nWhistles shrilled. Jack jumped. His heart beat faster. He felt as if the\nend of the quest were suddenly close. Somebody would be around the\ncorner. In a minute that person would be facing him, and then ...\n\nThen, he reflected, and sagged with a wave of disappointment at the\nthought, then there was nobody around the corner. It always happened\nthat way. Besides, there weren't any corners in this camp. He had\nreached the wall at the end of the alley. Why didn't he stop looking?\n\nSergeants lined the prisoners up four abreast preparatory to marching\nthem into the barracks. Jack supposed it was time to turn in for the\nnight. He submitted to their barked orders and hard hands without\nresentment. They seemed a long way off. For the ten thousandth time he\nwas thinking that this need not have happened.\n\nIf he had been man enough to grapple with himself, to wrestle as Jacob\ndid with the angel and not let loose until he had felled the problem, he\ncould be teaching philosophy in a quiet little college, as his father\ndid. He had graduated from high school with only average marks, and\nthen, instead of going to college, as his father had so much wanted him\nto, he had decided he would work a year. With his earnings, he would see\nthe world.\n\nHe had seen it, but when his money ran out he had not returned home. He\nhad drifted, taking jobs here and there, sleeping in flop-houses,\njungles, park benches, and freight cars.\n\nWhen the newly created Bureau of Health and Sanity had frozen jobs in an\neffort to solve the transiency problem, Jack had refused to work. He\nknew that he would not be able to quit a job without being arrested at\nonce. Like hundreds of thousands of other youths, he had begged and\nstolen and hidden from the local police and the Bohas.\n\nEven through all those years of misery and wandering, he had not once\nadmitted to himself the true nature of this fog-cottoned grail. He knew\nit, and he did not know it. It was patrolling the edge of his mind,\ncircling a far-off periphery, recognizable by a crude silhouette but\nnameless. Any time he wanted to, he could have summoned it closer and\nsaid, _You are it, and I know you, and I know what I am looking for. It\nis...? Is what? Worthless? Foolish? Insane? A dream?_\n\nJack had never had the courage to take that action. When it seemed the\nthing was galloping closer, charging down upon him, he ran away. It must\nstay on the horizon, moving on, always moving, staying out of his grasp.\n\n\"All you guys, for'ard 'arch!\"\n\nJack did not move. The truck from the rocket had come through a gate and\nstopped by the transies, and about fifty men were getting off the back.\n\nThe man behind Jack bumped into him. Jack paid him no attention. He did\nnot move. He squinted at the group who had come from the rocket. They\nwere very tall, hump-shouldered, and dressed in light grey-green Palm\nBeach suits and tan Panama hats. Each held a brown leather briefcase at\nthe end of a long, thin arm. Each wore on the bridge of his long nose a\npair of rose-colored glasses.\n\nA cry broke hoarsely from the transies. Some of those in front of Jack\nfell to their knees as if a sudden poison had paralyzed their legs. They\ncalled names and stretched out open hands. A boy by Jack's side sprawled\nface-down on the sand while he uttered over and over again, \"Mr.\nPelopoeus! Mr. Pelopoeus!\"\n\nThe name meant nothing to Jack. He did feel repulsed at seeing the\nfellow turn on his side, bend his neck forward, bring his clenched fists\nup against his chest, and jackknife his legs against his arms. He had\nseen it many times before in the transie jungles, but he had never\ngotten over the sickness it had first caused him.\n\nHe turned away and came almost nose to nose with one of the men from the\nrocket. He had put down his briefcase so it rested against his leg and\ntaken a white handkerchief out of his breast pocket to wipe the dust\nfrom his lenses. His lids were squeezed shut as if he found the lights\nunbearable.\n\nJack stared and could not move while a name that the boy behind him had\nbeen crying out slowly worked its way through his consciousness.\nSuddenly, like the roar of a flashflood that is just rounding the bend\nof a dry gulch, the syllables struck him. He lunged forward and clutched\nat the spectacles in the man's hand. At the same time he yelled over and\nover the words that had filled out the blank in his memory.\n\n\"Mr. Eumenes! Mr. Eumenes!\"\n\nA sergeant cursed and slammed his fist into Jack's face. Jack fell down,\nflat on his back. Though his jaw felt as if it were torn loose from its\nhinge, he rolled over on his side, raised himself on his hands and\nknees, and began to get up to his feet.\n\n\"Stand still!\" bellowed the sergeant. \"Stay in formation or you'll get\nmore of the same!\"\n\nJack shook his head until it cleared. He crouched and held out his hands\ntoward the man, but he did not move his feet. Over and over,\nhalf-chanting, half-crooning, he said, \"Mr. Eumenes! The glasses!\nPlease, Mr. Eumenes, the glasses!\"\n\nThe forty-nine Mr. Eumenae-and-otherwise looked incuriously with\nimpenetrable rosy eyes. The fiftieth put the white handkerchief back in\nhis pocket. His mouth opened. False teeth gleamed. With his free hand he\ntook off his hat and waved it at the crowd and bowed.\n\nHis tilted head showed a white fuzzlike hair that shot up over his pale\nscalp. His gestures were both comic and terrifying. The hat and the\ninclination of his body said far more than words could. They said,\n_Good-by forever, and bon voyage!_\n\nThen Mr. Eumenes straightened up and opened his lids.\n\nAt first, the sockets looked as if they held no eyeballs, as if they\nwere empty of all but shadows.\n\nJack saw them from a distance. Mr. Eumenes-or-his-twin was shooting away\nfaster and faster and becoming smaller and smaller. No! He himself was.\nHe was rocketing away within his own body. He was falling down a deep\nwell.\n\nHe, Jack Crane, was a hollow shaft down which he slipped and screamed,\naway, away, from the world outside. It was like seeing from the wrong\nend of a pair of binoculars that lengthened and lengthened while the man\nwith the long-sought-for treasure in his hand flew in the opposite\ndirection as if he had been connected to the horizon by a rubber band\nand somebody had released it and he was flying towards it, away from\nJack.\n\nEven as this happened, as he knew vaguely that his muscles were locking\ninto the posture of a beggar, hands out, pleading, face twisted into an\nagony of asking, lips repeating his croon-chant, he saw what had\noccurred.\n\nThe realization was like the sudden, blinding, and at the same time\nclarifying light that sometimes comes to epileptics just as they are\ngoing into a seizure. It was the thought that he had kept away on the\nhorizon of his mind, the thought that now charged in on him with long\nleaps and bounds and then stopped and sat on its haunches and grinned at\nhim while its long tongue lolled.\n\nOf course, he should have known all these years what it was. He should\nhave known that Mr. Eumenes was the worst thing in the world for him. He\nhad known it, but, like a drug addict, he had refused to admit it. He\nhad searched for the man. Yet he had known it would be fatal to find\nhim. The rose-colored spectacles would swing gates that should never be\nfully open. And he should have guessed _what_ and _who_ Mr. Eumenes was\nwhen that encyclopedic fellow in the truck had singsonged those names.\n\nHow could he have been so stupid? Stupid? It was easy! He had _wanted_\nto be stupid! And how could the Mr. Eumenes-or-otherwise have used such\nobvious giveaway names? It was a measure of their contempt for the\nhumans around them and of their own grim wit. Look at all the double\nentendres the salesman had given his father, and his father had never\nsuspected. Even the head of the Bureau of Health and Sanity had been\nterrifyingly blas\u00e9 about it.\n\nDr. Vespa. He had thrown his name like a gauntlet to humanity, and\nhumanity had stared idiotically at it and never guessed its meaning.\nVespa was a good Italian name. Jack didn't know what it meant, but he\nsupposed that it had the same meaning as the Latin. He remembered it\nfrom his high school class.\n\nAs for his not encountering the salesman until now, he had been lucky.\nIf he had run across him during his search, he would have been denied\nthe glasses, as now. And the shock would have made him unable to cry out\nand betray the man. He would have done what he was so helplessly doing\nat this moment, and he would have been carted off to an institution.\n\nHow many other transies had seen that unforgettable face on the streets,\nthe end of their search, and gone at once into that state that made them\nlegal prey of the Bohas?\n\nThat was almost his last rational thought. He could no longer feel his\nflesh. A thin red curtain was falling between him and his senses.\nEverywhere it billowed out beneath him and eased his fall. Everywhere it\nswirled and softened the outlines of things that were streaking by--a\nlarge tree that he remembered seeing in his living room, a naked giant,\nhis father, leaning against it and eating an apple, and a delicate\nlittle white creature cropping flowers.\n\nYet all this while he lived in two worlds. One was the passage downwards\ntowards the Garden of Eden. The other was that hemisphere in which he\nhad dwelt so reluctantly, the one he now perceived through the\nthickening red veil of his sight and other senses.\n\nThey were not yet gone. He could feel the hands of the black-clad\nofficers lifting him up and laying him upon some hard substance that\nrocked and dumped. Every lurch and thud was only dimly felt. Then he was\nplaced upon something softer and carried into what he vaguely sensed was\nthe interior of one of the barracks.\n\nSome time later--he didn't know or care when, for he had lost all\nconception or even definition of time--he looked up the deep\neverlengthening shaft of himself into the eyes of another Mr. Eumenes or\nMr. Sphex or Dr. Vespa or whatever he called himself. He was in white\nand wore a stethoscope around his neck.\n\nBeside him stood another of his own kind. This one wore lipstick and a\nnurse's cap. She carried a tray on which were several containers. One\ncontainer held a large and sharp scalpel. The other held an egg. It was\nabout twice the size of a hen's egg.\n\nJack saw all this just before the veil took on another shade of red and\nblurred completely his vision of the outside. But the final thickening\ndid not keep him from seeing that Doctor Eumenes was staring down at him\nas if he were peering into a dusky burrow. And Jack could make out the\neyes. They were large, much larger than they should have been at the\nspeed with which Jack was receding. They were not the pale pink of an\nalbino's. They were black from corner to corner and built of a dozen or\nso hexagons whose edges caught the light.\n\nThey twinkled.\n\nLike jewels.\n\nOr the eyes of an enormous and evolved wasp.\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ January 1954.\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
