Of astronomical necessity, our flights were irregular. The\nspring of 2070, with both planets close to the Earth, we were making\ntwo complete round trips. We had just arrived in Greater New York, one\nMay evening, from Grebhar, Venus Free State. With only five hours in\nport here, we were departing the same night at the zero hour for\nFerrok-Shahn, capital of the Martian Union.\n\nWe were no sooner at the landing stage than I found a code flash\nsummoning Dan Dean and me to Divisional Detective Headquarters. Dan\n\"Snap\" Dean was one of my closest friends. He was electron-radio\noperator of the _Planetara_. A small, wiry, red-headed chap, with a\nquick, ready laugh and the kind of wit that made everyone like him.\n\nThe summons to Detective-Colonel Halsey's office surprised us. Dean\neyed me.\n\n\"You haven't been opening any treasure vaults, have you, Gregg?\"\n\n\"He wants you, also,\" I retorted.\n\nHe laughed. \"Well, he can roar at me like a traffic switch-man and my\nprivate life will remain my own.\"\n\nWe could not think why we should be wanted. It was the darkness of\nmid-evening when we left the _Planetara_ for Halsey's office. It was\nnot a long trip. We went on the upper monorail, descending into the\nsubterranean city at Park Circle 30.\n\nWe had never been to Halsey's office before. Now we found it to be a\ngloomy, vaultlike place in one of the deepest corridors. The door\nlifted.\n\n\"Gregg Haljan and Daniel Dean.\"\n\nThe guard stood aside. \"Come in.\"\n\nI own that my heart was unduly thumping as we entered. The door\ndropped behind us. It was a small blue-lit apartment--a steel-lined\nroom like a vault.\n\nColonel Halsey sat at his desk. And the big, heavy-set, florid Captain\nCarter--our commander on the _Planetara_--was here. That surprised us:\nwe had not seen him leave the ship.\n\nHalsey smiled at us gravely. Captain Carter spoke with an ominous\ncalmness: \"Sit down, lads.\"\n\nWe took the seats. There was an alarming solemnity about this. If I\nhad been guilty of anything that I could think of, it would have been\nfrightening. But Halsey's words reassured me.\n\n\"It's about the Grantline Moon Expedition. In spite of our secrecy,\nthe news has gotten out. We want to know how. Can you tell us?\"\n\nCaptain Carter's huge bulk--he was about as tall as I am--towered over\nus as we sat before Halsey's desk. \"If you lads have told anyone--said\nanything--let _slip_ the slightest hint about it....\"\n\nSnap smiled with relief; but he turned solemn at once. \"I haven't. Not\na word!\"\n\n\"Nor have I!\" I declared.\n\nThe Grantline Moon Expedition! We had not thought of that as a reason\nfor this summons. Johnny Grantline was a close friend of ours. He had\norganized an exploring expedition to the Moon. Uninhabited, with its\nbleak, forbidding, airless, waterless surface, the Moon--even though\nso close to the Earth--was seldom visited. No regular ship ever\nstopped there. A few exploring parties of recent years had come to\ngrief.\n\nBut there was a persistent rumor that upon the Moon, mineral riches of\nfabulous wealth were awaiting discovery. The thing had already caused\nsome interplanetary complications. The aggressive Martians would be\nonly too glad to explore the Moon. But the United States of the World,\nwhich came into being in 2067, definitely warned them away. The Moon\nwas Earth territory, we announced, and we would protect it as such.\n\nThere was, nevertheless, a realization by our government, that\nwhatever riches might be upon the Moon should be seized at once and\nheld by some reputable Earth Company. And when John Grantline applied,\nwith his father's wealth and his own scientific record of attainment,\nthe government was glad to grant him its writ.\n\nThe Grantline Expedition had started six months ago. The Martian\ngovernment had acquiesced to our ultimatum, yet brigands have been\nknown to be financed under cover of a government disavowal. And so our\nexpedition was kept secret.\n\nMy words need give no offence to any Martian who comes upon them. I\nrefer to the history of our Earth only. The Grantline Expedition was\non the Moon now. No word had come from it. One could not flash helios\neven in code without letting all the universe know that explorers were\non the Moon. And why they were there, anyone could easily guess.\n\nAnd now Colonel Halsey was telling us that the news was abroad!\nCaptain Carter eyed us closely; his flashing eyes under the white\nbushy brows would pry a secret from anyone.\n\n\"You're sure? A girl of Venus, perhaps, with her cursed, seductive\nlure! A chance word, with you lads befuddled by alcolite?\"\n\nWe assured him that we had been careful. By the heavens, I know that I\nhad been. Not a whisper, even to Snap, of the name Grantline in six\nmonths or more.\n\nCaptain Carter added abruptly, \"We're insulated here, Halsey?\"\n\n\"Yes. Talk as freely as you like. An eavesdropping ray will never get\nthrough to us.\"\n\nThey questioned us. They were satisfied at last that, though the\nsecret had escaped, we had not given it away. Hearing it discussed, it\noccurred to me to wonder why Carter was concerned. I was not aware\nthat he knew of Grantline's venture. I learned now the reason why the\n_Planetara_, upon each of her last voyages, had managed to pass fairly\nclose to the Moon. It had been arranged with Grantline that if he\nwanted help or had any important message, he was to flash it locally\nto our passing ship. And this Snap knew, and had never mentioned it,\neven to me.\n\nHalsey was saying, \"Well, apparently we can't blame you: but the\nsecret is out.\"\n\nSnap and I regarded each other. What could anyone do? What would\nanyone dare do?\n\nCaptain Carter said abruptly, \"Look here, lads, this is my chance now\nto talk plainly to you. Outside, anywhere outside these walls, an\neavesdropping ray may be upon us. You know that? One may never even\ndare to whisper since that accursed ray was developed.\"\n\nSnap opened his mouth to speak but decided against it. My heart was\npounding.\n\nCaptain Carter went on: \"I know I can trust you two more than anyone\nunder me on the _Planetara_.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\" I demanded. \"What--\"\n\nHe interrupted me. \"Just what I said.\"\n\nHalsey smiled grimly. \"What he means, Haljan, is that things are not\nalways what they seem these days. One cannot always tell a friend from\nan enemy. The _Planetara_ is a public vessel. You have--how many is\nit, Carter?--thirty or forty passengers this trip tonight?\"\n\n\"Thirty-eight,\" said Carter.\n\n\"There are thirty-eight people listed for the flight to Ferrok-Shahn\ntonight,\" Halsey said slowly. \"And some may not be what they seem.\" He\nraised his thin dark hand. \"We have information....\" He paused. \"I\nconfess, we know almost nothing--hardly more than enough to alarm us.\"\n\nCaptain Carter interjected, \"I want you and Dean to be on your guard.\nOnce on the _Planetara_ it is difficult for us to talk openly, but be\nwatchful. I will arrange for us to be doubly armed.\"\n\nVague, perturbing words! Halsey said, \"They tell me George Prince is\nlisted for the voyage. I am suggesting, Haljan, that you keep your eye\nespecially on him. Your duties on the _Planetara_ leave you\ncomparatively free, don't they?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I agreed. With the first and second officers on duty, and the\nCaptain aboard, my routine was more or less that of an understudy.\n\nI said, \"George Prince? Who is he?\"\n\n\"A mechanical engineer,\" said Halsey. \"An underofficial of the Earth\nFederated Catalyst Corporation. But he associates with bad\ncompanions--particularly Martians.\"\n\nI had never heard of this George Prince, though I was familiar with\nthe Federated Catalyst Corporation, of course. A semigovernment trust,\nwhich controlled virtually the entire Earth supply of radiactum, the\ncatalyst mineral which was revolutionizing industry.\n\n\"He was in the Automotive Department,\" Carter put in. \"You've heard of\nthe Federated Radiactum Motor?\"\n\nWe had, of course. It was a recent Earth discovery and invention. An\nengine of a new type, using radiactum as its fuel.\n\nSnap demanded, \"What in the stars has this got to do with Johnny\nGrantline?\"\n\n\"Much,\" said Halsey quietly, \"or perhaps nothing. But George Prince\nsome years ago mixed in rather unethical transactions. We had him in\ncustody once. He is known as unusually friendly with several Martians\nin Greater New York of bad reputation.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"What you don't know,\" Halsey said, \"is that Grantline expects to find\nradiactum on the Moon.\"\n\nWe gasped.\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Halsey. \"The ill-fated Ballon Expedition thought they\nhad found it on the Moon, shortly after its merit was discovered. A\nnew type of ore--a lode of it is there somewhere, without doubt.\"\n\nHe added vehemently, \"Do you understand now why we should be\nsuspicious of this George Prince? He has a criminal record. He has a\nthorough technical knowledge of radium ores. He associates with\nMartians of bad reputation. A large Martian company has recently\ndeveloped a radiactum engine to compete with our Earth motor. There is\nvery little radiactum available on Mars, and our government will not\nallow our own supply to be exported. What do you suppose that company\non Mars would pay for a few tons of richly radioactive radiactum such\nas Grantline may have found on the Moon?\"\n\n\"But,\" I objected, \"That is a reputable Martian company. It's backed\nby the government of the Martian Union. The government of Mars would\nnot dare--\"\n\n\"Of course not!\" Captain Carter exclaimed sardonically. \"Not openly!\nBut if Martian Brigands had a supply of radiactum I don't imagine\nwhere it came from would make much difference. The Martian company\nwould buy it, and you know that as well as I do!\"\n\nHalsey added, \"And George Prince, my agents inform me, seems to know\nthat Grantline is on the Moon. Put it all together, lads. Little\nsparks show the hidden current.\n\n\"More than that: George Prince knows that we have arranged to have the\n_Planetara_ stop at the Moon and bring back Grantline's ore.... This\nis your last voyage this year. You'll hear from Grantline this time,\nwe're convinced. He'll probably give you the signal as you pass the\nMoon on your way out. Coming back, you'll stop at the Moon and\ntransport whatever radiactum ore Grantline has ready. The Grantline\nFlyer is too small for ore transportation.\"\n\nHalsey's voice turned grimly sarcastic. \"Doesn't it seem queer that\nGeorge Prince and a few of his Martian friends happen to be listed as\npassengers for this voyage?\"\n\nIn the silence that followed, Snap and I regarded each other. Halsey\nadded abruptly:\n\n\"We had George Prince typed that time we arrested him four years ago.\nI'll show him to you.\"\n\nHe snapped open an alcove, and said to his waiting attendant \"Flash on\nthe type of George Prince.\"\n\nAlmost at once, the image glowed on the grids before us. He stood\nsmiling sourly before us as he repeated the official formula:\n\n\"My name is George Prince. I was born in Greater New York twenty-five\nyears ago.\"\n\nI gazed at this televised image of George Prince. He stood somber in\nthe black detention uniform, silhouetted sharply against the\nregulation backdrop of vivid scarlet. A dark, almost femininely\nhandsome fellow, well below medium height--the rod checking him showed\nfive foot four inches. Slim and slight. Long, wavy black hair, falling\nabout his ears. A pale, clean-cut, really handsome face, almost\nbeardless. I regarded it closely. A face that would have been\nbeautiful without its masculine touch of heavy black brows and firmly\nset jaw. His voice as he spoke was low and soft; but at the end, with\nthe concluding words, \"I am innocent!\" it flashed into strong\nmasculinity. His eyes, shaded with long girlish black lashes, by\nchance met mine. \"I am innocent.\" His curving sensuous lips drew down\ninto a grim sneer....\n\nHalsey snapped a button. He turned back to Snap and me as his\nattendant drew the curtain, hiding the black grid.\n\n\"Well, there he is. We have nothing tangible against him now. But I'll\nsay this: he's a clever fellow, one to be afraid of. I would not blare\nit from the newscasters' stadium, but if he is hatching any plot, he\nhas been too clever for my agents!\"\n\nWe talked for another half-hour, and then Captain Carter dismissed us.\nWe left Halsey's office with Carter's final words ringing in our ears.\n\"Whatever comes, lads, remember I trust you....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSnap and I decided to walk part of the way back to the ship. It was\nbarely more than a mile through this subterranean corridor to where we\ncould get the vertical lift direct to the landing stage.\n\nWe started off on the lower level. Once outside the insulation of\nHalsey's office we did not dare talk of this thing. Not only\nelectrical ears, but every possible eavesdropping device might be upon\nus. The corridor was two hundred feet or more below the ground level.\nAt this hour of the night the business section was comparatively\ndeserted. The stores and office arcades were all closed.\n\nOur footfall echoed on the metal grids as we hurried along. I felt\ndepressed and oppressed. As though prying eyes were upon me. We walked\nfor a time in silence, each of us busy with memory of what had\ntranspired at Halsey's office.\n\nSuddenly Snap gripped me. \"What's that?\"\n\n\"Where?\" I whispered.\n\nWe stopped at a corner. An entryway was here. Snap pulled me into it.\nI could feel him quivering with excitement.\n\n\"What is it?\" I demanded in a whisper.\n\n\"We're being followed. Did you hear anything?\"\n\n\"No!\" Yet I thought now that I could hear something. Vague footfalls.\nA rustling. And a microscopic whine, as though some device were within\nrange of us.\n\nSnap was fumbling in his pocket. \"Wait! I've got a pair of low-scale\ndetectors.\"\n\nHe put the little grids against his ears. I could hear the sharp\nintake of his breath. Then he seized me, pulled me down to the metal\nfloor of the entryway.\n\n\"Back, Gregg! Get back!\" I could barely hear his whisper. We crouched\nas far back into the doorway as we could get. I was armed. My official\npermit for the carrying of the pencil heat ray allowed me always to\nhave it with me. I drew it now. But there was nothing to shoot at. I\nfelt Snap clamping the grids on my ears. And now I heard something! An\nintensification of the vague footsteps I had thought I heard before.\n\nThere was something following us! Something out in the corridor there\nnow! The corridor was dim, but plainly visible, and as far as I could\nsee it was empty. But there was something there. Something invisible!\nI could hear it moving. Creeping toward us. I pulled the grids off my\nears.\n\nSnap murmured, \"You've got a local phone?\"\n\n\"Yes. I'll get them to give us the street glare!\"\n\nI pressed the danger signal, giving our location to the operator. In a\nsecond we got the light. The street in all this neighborhood burst\ninto a brilliant actinic glare. The thing menacing us was revealed! A\nfigure in a black cloak, crouching thirty feet away across the\ncorridor.\n\nSnap was unarmed but he flung his hands out menacingly. The figure,\nwhich may perhaps not have been aware of our city safeguard, was taken\nwholly by surprise. A human figure, seven feet tall at the least, and\ntherefore, I judged, a Martian man. The black cloak covered his head.\nHe took a step toward us, hesitated, and then turned in confusion.\n\nSnap's shrill voice was bringing help. The whine of a street guard's\nalarm whistle nearby sounded. The figure was making off! My pencil ray\nwas in my hand and I pressed its switch. The tiny heat ray stabbed\nthrough the air, but I missed. The figure stumbled but did not fall. I\nsaw a bare gray arm come from the cloak, flung up to maintain its\nbalance. Or perhaps my pencil ray had seared his arm. The gray-skinned\narm of a Martian.\n\nSnap was shouting, \"Give him another!\" But the figure passed beyond\nthe actinic glare and vanished.\n\nWe were detained in the turmoil of the corridor for ten minutes or\nmore with official explanations. Then a message from Halsey released\nus. The Martian who had been following us in his invisible cloak was\nnever caught.\n\nWe escaped from the crowd at last and made our way back to the\n_Planetara_, where the passengers were already assembling for the\noutward Martian voyage.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nI stood on the turret balcony of the _Planetara_ with Captain Carter\nand Dr. Frank, the ship surgeon, watching the arriving passengers. It\nwas close to the zero hour; the level of the stage was a turmoil of\nconfusion. The escalators, with the last of the freight aboard, were\nfolded back. But the stage was jammed with incoming passenger luggage,\nthe interplanetary customs and tax officials with their x-ray and\nzed-ray paraphernalia and the passengers themselves, lined up for the\nexport inspection.\n\nAt this height, the city lights lay spread in a glare of blue and\nyellow beneath us. The individual local planes came dropping like\nbirds to our stage. Thirty-eight passengers to Mars for this voyage,\nbut that accursed desire of every friend and relative to speed the\ndeparting voyager brought a hundred or more extra people to crowd our\ngirders and add to everybody's troubles.\n\nCarter was too absorbed in his duties to stay with us long. But here\nin the turret Dr. Frank and I found ourselves at the moment with\nnothing much to do but watch.\n\nDr. Frank was a thin, dark, rather smallish man of fifty, trim in his\nblue and white uniform. I knew him well: we had made several flights\ntogether. An American--I fancy of Jewish ancestry. A likable man, and\na skillful doctor and surgeon. He and I had always been good friends.\n\n\"Crowded,\" he said. \"Johnson says thirty-eight. I hope they're\nexperienced travelers. This pressure sickness is a rotten\nnuisance--keeps me dashing around all night assuring frightened women\nthey're not going to die. Last voyage, coming out of the Venus\natmosphere--\"\n\nHe plunged into a lugubrious account of his troubles with space sick\nvoyagers. But I was in no mood to listen to him. My gaze was down on\nthe spider incline, up which, over the bend of the ship's sleek,\nsilvery body, the passengers and their friends were coming in little\ngroups. The upper deck was already jammed with them.\n\nThe _Planetara_, as flyers go, was not a large vessel. Cylindrical of\nbody, forty feet maximum beam, and two hundred and seventy-five feet\nin length. The passenger superstructure--no more than a hundred feet\nlong--was set amidships. A narrow deck, metallically enclosed, and\nwith large bull's-eye windows, encircled the superstructure. Some of\nthe cabins opened directly onto the deck. Others had doors to the\ninterior corridors. There were half a dozen small but luxurious public\nrooms.\n\nThe rest of the vessel was given to freight storage and the mechanism\nand control compartments. Forward of the passenger structure the deck\nlevel continued under the cylindrical dome roof to the bow. The\nforward watch tower observatory was here, officers' cabins, Captain\nCarter's navigating rooms and Dr. Frank's office. Similarly, under the\nstern dome, was the stern watch tower and a series of power\ncompartments.\n\nAbove the superstructure a confusion of spider bridges, ladders and\nbalconies were laced like a metal network. The turret in which Dr.\nFrank and I now stood was perched here. Fifty feet away, like a bird's\nnest, Snap's instrument room stood clinging to the metal bridge. The\ndome roof, with the glassite windows rolled back now, rose in a mound\npeak to cover the highest middle portion of the vessel.\n\nBelow, in the main hull, blue lit metal corridors ran the entire\nlength of the ship. Freight storage compartments; gravity control\nrooms; the air renewal system; heater and ventilators and pressure\nmechanisms--all were located there. And the kitchens, stewards'\ncompartments, and the living quarters of the crew. We carried a crew\nof sixteen, this voyage, exclusive of the navigating officers, the\npurser, Snap Dean, and Dr. Frank.\n\nThe passengers coming aboard seemed a fair representation of what we\nusually had for the outward voyage to Ferrok-Shahn. Most were Earth\npeople--and returning Martians. Dr. Frank pointed out one. A huge\nMartian in a grey cloak. A seven foot fellow.\n\n\"His name is _Set_ Miko,\" Dr. Frank remarked. \"Ever heard of him?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said. \"Should I?\"\n\n\"Well--\" The doctor suddenly checked himself, as though he were sorry\nhe had spoken.\n\n\"I never heard of him,\" I repeated slowly.\n\nAn awkward silence fell between us.\n\nThere were a few Venus passengers. I saw one of them presently coming\nup the incline, and recognized her. A girl traveling alone. We had\nbrought her from Grebhar, last voyage but one. I remembered her. An\nalluring sort of girl, as most of them are. Her name was Venza. She\nspoke English well. A singer and dancer who had been imported to\nGreater New York to fill some theatrical engagement. She'd made quite\na hit on the Great White Way.\n\nShe came up the incline with the carrier ahead of her. Gazing up, she\nsaw Dr. Frank and me at the turret window, smiled and waved her white\narm in greeting.\n\nDr. Frank laughed. \"By the gods of the airways, there's Alta Venza!\nYou saw that look, Gregg? That was for me, not you.\"\n\n\"Reasonable enough,\" I retorted. \"But I doubt it--the Venza is nothing\nif not impartial.\"\n\nI wondered what could be taking Venza now to Mars. I was glad to see\nher. She was diverting. Educated. Well traveled. Spoke English with a\ncolloquial, theatrical manner more characteristic of Greater New York\nthan of Venus. And for all her light banter, I would rather put my\ntrust in her than any Venus girl I had ever met.\n\nThe hum of the departing siren was sounding. Friends and relatives of\nthe passengers were crowding the exit incline. The deck was clearing.\nI had not seen George Prince come aboard. And then I thought I saw him\ndown on the landing stage, just arrived from a private tube car. A\nsmall, slight figure. The customs men were around him. I could only\nsee his head and shoulders. Pale, girlishly handsome face; long, black\nhair to the base of his neck. He was bare-headed, with the hood of his\ntraveling cloak pushed back.\n\nI stared, and I saw that Dr. Frank was also gazing down. But neither\nof us spoke.\n\nThen I said upon impulse, \"Suppose we go down to the deck, Doctor?\"\n\nHe acquiesced. We descended to the lower room of the turret and\nclambered down the spider ladder to the upper deck level. The head of\nthe arriving incline was near us. Preceded by two carriers who were\nlittered with hand luggage, George Prince was coming up the incline.\nHe was closer now. I recognized him from the type we had seen in\nHalsey's office.\n\nAnd then, with a shock, I saw it was not so. This was a girl coming\naboard. An arc light over the incline showed her clearly when she was\nhalf way up. A girl with her hood pushed back; her face framed in\nthick black hair. I saw now it was not a man's cut of hair; but long\nbraids coiled up under the dangling hood.\n\nDr. Frank must have remarked my amazed expression. \"Little beauty,\nisn't she?\"\n\n\"Who is she?\"\n\nWe were standing back against the wall of the superstructure. A\npassenger was near us--the Martian whom Dr. Frank had called Miko. He\nwas loitering here, quite evidently watching this girl come aboard.\nBut as I glanced at him, he looked away and casually sauntered off.\n\nThe girl came up and reached the deck. \"I am in A22,\" she told the\ncarrier. \"My brother came aboard a couple of hours ago.\"\n\nDr. Frank answered my whisper. \"That's Anita Prince.\"\n\nShe was passing quite close to us on the deck, following the carrier,\nwhen she stumbled and very nearly fell. I was nearest to her. I leaped\nforward and caught her as she nearly went down.\n\nWith my arm about her, I raised her up and set her upon her feet\nagain. She had twisted her ankle. She balanced herself upon it. The\npain of it eased up in a moment.\n\n\"I'm all right--thank you!\"\n\nIn the dimness of the blue lit deck I met her eyes. I was holding her\nwith my encircling arm. She was small and soft against me. Her face,\nframed in the thick, black hair, smiled up at me. Small, oval\nface--beautiful--yet firm of chin, and stamped with the mark of its\nown individuality. No empty-headed beauty, this.\n\n\"I'm all right, thank you very much--\"\n\nI became conscious that I had not released her. I felt her hands\npushing at me. And then it seemed that for an instant she yielded and\nwas clinging. And I met her startled upflung gaze. Eyes like a purple\nnight with the sheen of misty starlight in them.\n\nI heard myself murmuring, \"I beg your pardon. Yes, of course!\" I\nreleased her.\n\nShe thanked me again and followed the carriers along the deck. She was\nlimping slightly.\n\nAn instant she had clung to me. A brief flash of something, from her\neyes to mine--from mine back to hers. The poets write that love can be\nborn of such a glance. The first meeting, across all the barriers of\nwhich love springs unsought, unbidden--defiant, sometimes. And the\ntroubadours of old would sing: \"A fleeting glance; a touch; two wildly\nbeating hearts--and love was born.\"\n\nI think, with Anita and me, it must have been like that.\n\nI stood, gazing after her, unconscious of Dr. Frank, who was watching\nme with his quizzical smile. And presently, no more than a quarter\nbeyond the zero hour, the _Planetara_ got away. With the dome windows\nbattened tightly, we lifted from the landing stage and soared over the\nglowing city. The phosphorescence of the electronic tubes was like a\ncomet's tail behind us as we slid upward.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nAt six A.M., Earth Eastern time, which we were still carrying, Snap\nDean and I were alone in his instrument room, perched in the network\nover the _Planetara's_ deck. The bulge of the dome enclosed us; it\nrounded like a great observatory window some twenty feet above the\nceiling of this little metal cubbyhole.\n\nThe _Planetara_ was still in Earth's shadow. The firmament--black,\ninterstellar space with its blazing white, red and yellow stars--lay\nspread around us. The Moon, with nearly all its disc illumined, hung,\na great silver ball, over our bow quarter. Behind it, to one side,\nMars floated like the red tip of a smoldering cigar in the blackness.\nThe Earth, behind our stern, was dimly, redly visible--a giant sphere,\netched with the configurations of its oceans and continents. Upon one\nlimb a touch of sunlight hung on the mountain tops with a crescent\nred-yellow sheen.\n\nAnd then we plunged from the cone shadow. The Sun with the leaping\ncorona, burst through the blackness behind us. The Earth lighted into\na huge, thin crescent with hooked cusps.\n\nTo Snap and me, the glories of the heavens were too familiar to be\nremarked. And upon this voyage particularly we were in no mood to\nconsider them. I had been in the radio room several hours. When the\n_Planetara_ started, and my few routine duties were over, I could\nthink of nothing save Halsey's and Carter's admonition: \"Be on your\nguard. And particularly--watch George Prince.\"\n\nI had not seen George Prince. But I had seen his sister, whom Carter\nand Halsey had not bothered to mention. My heart was still pounding\nwith the memory.\n\nDr. Frank evidently was having little trouble with pressure sick\npassengers. The _Planetara's_ equalizers were fairly efficient.\nProwling through the silent metal lounges and passages, I went to the\ndoor of A22. It was on the deck level, in a tiny transverse passage\njust off the main lounging room. Its name-grid glowed with the\nletters: _Anita Prince_. I stood in my short white trousers and white\nsilk shirt, like a cabin steward staring. Anita Prince! I had never\nheard the name until this night. But there was magic music in it now,\nas I murmured it.\n\nShe was here, doubtless asleep, behind this small metal door. It\nseemed as though that little oval grid were the gateway to a fairyland\nof my dreams.\n\nI turned away. Thought of the Grantline Moon Expedition stabbed at me.\nGeorge Prince--Anita's brother--he whom I had been warned to watch.\nThis renegade--associate of dubious Martians, plotting God knows what.\n\nI saw, upon the adjoining door, A20, _George Prince_. I listened. In\nthe humming stillness of the ship's interior there was no sound from\nthese cabins. A20 was without windows, I knew. But Anita's room had a\nwindow and a door which gave upon the deck. I went through the lounge,\nout its arch and walked the deck length. The deck door and window of\nA22 were closed and dark.\n\nThe deck was dim with white starlight from the side ports. Chairs were\nhere but they were all empty. From the bow windows of the arching dome\na flood of moonlight threw long, slanting shadows down the deck. At\nthe corner where the superstructure ended, I thought I saw a figure\nlurking as though watching me. I went that way, but it vanished.\n\nI turned the corner, went the width of the ship to the other side.\nThere was no one in sight save the observer on his spider bridge, high\nin the bow network, and the second officer, on duty on the turret\nbalcony almost directly over me.\n\nAs I stood and listened, I suddenly heard footsteps. From the\ndirection of the bow a figure came. Purser Johnson.\n\nHe greeted me. \"Cooling off, Gregg?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said.\n\nHe passed me and went into the smoking room door nearby.\n\nI stood a moment at one of the deck windows, gazing at the stars; and\nfor no reason at all I realized I was tense. Johnson was a great one\nfor his regular sleep--it was wholly unlike him to be roaming about\nthe ship at such an hour. Had he been watching me? I told myself it\nwas nonsense. I was suspicious of everyone, everything, this voyage.\n\nI heard another step. Captain Carter appeared from his chart room\nwhich stood in the center of the narrowing open deck space near the\nbow. I joined him at once.\n\n\"Who was that?\" he half whispered.\n\n\"Johnson.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes.\" He fumbled in his uniform; his gaze swept the moonlit deck.\n\"Gregg--take this.\" He handed me a small metal box. I stuffed it at\nonce into my shirt.\n\n\"An insulator,\" he added swiftly. \"Snap is in his office. Take it to\nhim, Gregg. Stay with him--you'll have a measure of security--and you\ncan help him to make the photographs.\" He was barely whispering. \"I\nwon't be with you--no use making it look as though we were doing\nanything unusual. If your graphs show anything--or if Snap picks up\nany message--bring it to me.\" He added aloud, \"Well, it will be cool\nenough presently, Gregg.\"\n\nHe sauntered away toward his chart room.\n\n\"By heavens, what a relief!\" Snap murmured as the current went on. We\nhad wired his cubby with the insulator; within its barrage we could at\nleast talk with a degree of freedom.\n\n\"You've seen George Prince, Gregg?\"\n\n\"No. He's assigned A20. But I saw his sister. Snap, no one ever\nmentioned--\"\n\nSnap had heard of her, but he hadn't known that she was listed for\nthis voyage. \"A real beauty, so I've heard. Accursed shame for a\ndecent girl to have a brother like that.\"\n\nI could agree with him there....\n\nIt was now six A.M. Snap had been busy all night with routine\ncosmos-radios from the Earth, following our departure. He had a pile\nof them beside him.\n\n\"Nothing queer looking?\" I suggested.\n\n\"No. Not a thing.\"\n\nWe were at this time no more than sixty-five thousand miles from the\nMoon's surface. The _Planetara_ presently would swing upon her direct\ncourse for Mars. There was nothing which could cause passenger\ncomment in this close passing of the Moon; normally we used the\nsatellite's attraction to give us additional starting speed.\n\nIt was now or never that a message would come from Grantline. He was\nsupposed to be upon the Earthward side of the Moon. While Snap had\nrushed through with his routine, I searched the Moon's surface with\nour glass.\n\nBut there was nothing. Copernicus and Kepler lay in full sunlight. The\nheights of the lunar mountains, the depths of the barren, empty seas\nwere etched black and white, clear and clean. Grim, forbidding\ndesolation, this unchanging Moon. In romance, moonlight may shimmer\nand sparkle to light a lover's smile; but the reality of the Moon is\ncold and bleak. There was nothing to show my prying eyes where the\nintrepid Grantline might be.\n\n\"Nothing at all, Snap.\"\n\nAnd Snap's instruments, attuned for an hour now to pick up the\nfaintest signal, were motionless.\n\n\"If he has concentrated any appreciable amount of ore,\" said Snap. \"We\nshould get an impulse from its rays.\"\n\nBut our receiving shield was dark, untouched. Our mirror grid gave the\nmagnified images; the spectro, with its wave length selection,\npictured the mountain levels and slowly descended into the deepest\nseas.\n\nThere was nothing.\n\nYet in those Moon caverns--a million million recesses amid the crags\nof that tumbled, barren surface--the pin point of movement which might\nhave been Grantline's expedition could so easily be hiding! Could he\nhave the ore insulated, fearing its rays would betray its presence to\nhostile watchers?\n\nOr might disaster have come to him? He might not be on this hemisphere\nof the Moon at all....\n\nMy imagination, sharpened by fancy of a lurking menace which seemed\neverywhere about the _Planetara_ this voyage, ran rife with fears for\nJohnny Grantline. He had promised to communicate this voyage. It was\nnow, or perhaps never.\n\nSix-thirty came and passed. We were well beyond the Earth's shadow\nnow. The firmament blazed with its vivid glories; the Sun behind us\nwas a ball of yellow-red leaping flames. The Earth hung, a huge, dull\nred half sphere.\n\nWe were within forty thousand miles of the Moon. A giant white\nball--all of its disc visible to the naked eye. It poised over the\nbow, and presently, as the _Planetara_ swung upon its course for Mars,\nit shifted sidewise. The light of it glared white and dazzling in our\nwindows.\n\nSnap, with his habitual red celluloid eyeshade shoved high on his\nforehead, worked over our instruments.\n\n\"Gregg!\"\n\nThe receiving shield was glowing a trifle. Rays were bombarding it! It\nglowed, gleamed phosphorescent, and the audible recorder began\nsounding its tiny tinkling murmurs.\n\nGamma rays! Snap sprang to the dials. The direction and strength were\nsoon obvious. A richly radioactive ore body was concentrated upon this\nhemisphere of the Moon! It was unmistakable.\n\n\"He's got it, Gregg! He's--\"\n\nThe tiny grids began quivering. Snap exclaimed triumphantly, \"Here he\ncomes! By God, the message at last!\"\n\nSnap decoded it.\n\n_Success! Stop for ore on your return voyage. Will give you our\nlocation later. Success beyond wildest hopes._\n\nSnap murmured, \"That's all. He's got the ore!\"\n\nWe were sitting in darkness, and abruptly I became aware that across\nour open window, where the insulation barrage was flung, the air was\nfaintly hissing. An interference there! I saw a tiny swirl of purple\nsparks. Someone--some hostile ray from the deck beneath us, or from\nthe spider bridge that led to our little room--someone out there was\ntrying to pry in!\n\nSnap impulsively reached for the absorbers to let in the outside\nlight. But I checked him.\n\n\"Wait!\" I cut off our barrage, opened our door and stepped to the\nnarrow metal bridge.\n\n\"You stay there, Snap!\" I whispered. Then I added aloud, \"Well, Snap,\nI'm going to bed. Glad you've cleaned up that batch of work.\"\n\nI banged the door upon him. The lacework of metal bridges seemed\nempty. I gazed up to the dome, and forward and aft. Twenty feet\nbeneath me was the metal roof of the cabin superstructure. Below it,\nboth sides of the deck showed. All patched with moonlight.\n\nNo one visible down there. I descended a ladder. The deck was empty.\nBut in the silence something was moving! Footsteps moving away from me\ndown the deck! I followed; and suddenly I was running. Chasing\nsomething I could hear, but could not see. It turned into the smoking\nroom.\n\nI burst in. And a real sound smothered the phantom. Johnson the purser\nwas sitting here alone in the dimness. He was smoking. I noticed that\nhis cigar held a long frail ash. It could not have been him I was\nchasing. He was sitting there quite calmly. A thick-necked, heavy\nfellow, easily out of breath. But he was breathing calmly now.\n\nHe sat up in amazement at my wild-eyed appearance, and the ash jarred\nfrom his cigar.\n\n\"Gregg! What in the devil--\"\n\nI tried to grin. \"I'm on my way to bed--worked all night helping\nSnap.\"\n\nI went past him, out the door into the main corridor. It was the only\nway the invisible prowler could have gone. But I was too late now--I\ncould hear nothing. I dashed forward into the main lounge. It was\nempty, dim and silent, a silence broken presently by a faint click, a\nstateroom door hastily closing. I swung and found myself in a tiny\ntransverse passage. The twin doors of A20 and A22 were before me.\n\nThe invisible eavesdropper had gone into one of these rooms! I\nlistened at each of the panels, but there was only silence within.\n\nThe interior of the ship was suddenly singing with the steward's\nsiren--the call to awaken the passengers. It startled me. I moved\nswiftly away. But as the siren shut off, in the silence I heard a\nsoft, musical voice:\n\n\"Wake up, Anita, I think that's the breakfast call.\"\n\nAnd her answer, \"All right, George.\"\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nI did not appear at that morning meal. I was exhausted and drugged\nwith lack of sleep. I had a moment with Snap to tell him what had\noccurred. Then I sought out Carter. He had his little chart room\ninsulated. And we were cautious. I told him what Snap and I had\nlearned: the rays from the Moon, proving that Grantline had\nconcentrated a considerable ore body. I also told him of Grantline's\nmessage.\n\n\"We'll stop on the way back, as he directs, Gregg.\" He bent closer to\nme. \"At Ferrok-Shahn I'm going to bring back a cordon of\nInterplanetary Police. The secret will be out, of course, when we stop\nat the Moon. We have no right, even now, to be flying this vessel as\nunguarded as it is.\"\n\nHe was very solemn. And he was grim when I told him of the invisible\neavesdropper.\n\n\"You think he overheard Grantline's message? Who was it? You seem to\nfeel it was George Prince?\"\n\nI told him I was convinced the prowler went into A20. When I mentioned\nthe purser, who seemed to have been watching me earlier in the night,\nand again was sitting in the smoking room when the eavesdropper fled\npast, Carter looked startled.\n\n\"Johnson is all right, Gregg.\"\n\n\"Does he know anything about this Grantline affair?\"\n\n\"No--no,\" said Carter hastily. \"You haven't mentioned it, have you?\"\n\n\"Of course I haven't. But why didn't Johnson hear that eavesdropper?\nAnd what was he doing there, anyway, at that hour of the morning?\"\n\nThe Captain ignored my questions. \"I'm going to have that Prince\nsuite searched--we can't be too careful.... Go to bed, Gregg, you need\nrest.\"\n\nI went to my cabin. It was located aft, on the stern deck, near the\nstern watch tower. A small metal room with a chair, a desk and a bunk.\nI made sure no one was in it. I sealed the lattice grill and the door,\nset the alarm trigger against any opening of them, and went to bed.\n\nThe siren for the midday meal awakened me. I had slept heavily. I felt\nrefreshed.\n\nI found the passengers already assembled at my table when I arrived in\nthe dining salon. It was a low vaulted metal room with blue and yellow\ntube lights. At its sides the oval windows showed the deck, with its\nports on the dome side, through which a vista of the starry firmament\nwas visible. We were well on our course to Mars. The Moon had dwindled\nto a pin point of light beside the crescent Earth. And behind them our\nSun blazed, visually the largest orb in the heavens. It was some\nsixty-eight million miles from the Earth to Mars. A flight,\nordinarily, of some ten days.\n\nThere were five tables in the dining salon, each with eight seats.\nSnap and I had one of the tables. We sat at the ends, with the\npassengers on each of the sides.\n\nSnap was in his seat when I arrived. He eyed me down the length of the\ntable. In a gay mood, he introduced me to the three men already\nseated:\n\n\"This is our third officer, Gregg Haljan. Big, handsome fellow, isn't\nhe? And as pleasant as he is good-looking. Gregg, this is Sero Ob\nHahn.\"\n\nI met the keen, somber gaze of a Venus man of middle age. A small,\nslim graceful man, with sleek black hair. His pointed face,\naccentuated by the pointed beard, was pallid. He wore a white and\npurple robe; upon his breast was a huge platinum ornament, a device\nlike a star and cross entwined.\n\n\"I am happy to meet you, sir.\" His voice was soft and deep.\n\n\"Ob Hahn,\" I repeated. \"I should have heard of you, no doubt, but--\"\n\nA smile plucked at his thin, gray lips. \"That is an error of mine, not\nyours. My mission is that all the universe shall hear of me.\"\n\n\"He's preaching the religion of the Venus mystics,\" Snap explained.\n\n\"And this enlightened gentleman,\" said Ob Hahn ironically, nodding to\nthe man, \"has just termed it fetishism. The ignorance--\"\n\n\"Oh, I say!\" protested the man at Ob Hahn's side. \"I mean, you seem to\nthink I meant something offensive. And as a matter of fact--\"\n\n\"We've an argument, Gregg,\" laughed Snap. \"This is Sir Arthur\nConiston, an English gentleman, lecturer and sky-trotter--that is, he\nwill be a sky-trotter; he tells us he plans a number of voyages.\"\n\nThe tall Englishman, in his white linen suit, bowed acknowledgement.\n\"My compliments, Mr. Haljan. I hope you have no strong religious\nconvictions, else we will make your table here very miserable!\"\n\nThe third passenger had evidently kept out of the argument. Snap\nintroduced him as Rance Rankin. An American--a quiet, blond fellow of\nthirty-five or forty.\n\nI ordered my breakfast and let the argument go on.\n\n\"Won't make me miserable,\" said Snap. \"I love an argument. You said,\nSir Arthur--\"\n\n\"I mean to say, I think I said too much. Mr. Rankin, you are more\ndiplomatic.\"\n\nRankin laughed. \"I am a magician,\" he said to me. \"A theatrical\nentertainer. I deal in tricks--how to fool an audience--\" His keen,\namused gaze was on Ob Hahn. \"This gentleman from Venus and I have too\nmuch in common to argue.\"\n\n\"A nasty one!\" the Englishman exclaimed. \"By Jove! Really, Mr. Rankin,\nyou're a bit too cruel!\"\n\nI could see we were doomed to have turbulent meals this voyage. I\nlike to eat in quiet; arguing passengers always annoy me. There were\nstill three seats vacant at our table; I wondered who would occupy\nthem. I soon learned the answer--for one seat at least. Rankin said\ncalmly:\n\n\"Where is the little Venus girl this meal?\" His glance went to the\nempty seat at my right hand. \"The Venza, isn't that her name? She and\nI are destined for the same theater in Ferrok-Shahn.\"\n\nSo Venza was to sit beside me. It was good news. Ten days of a\nreligious argument three times a day would be intolerable. But the\ncheerful Venza would help.\n\n\"She never eats the midday meal,\" said Snap. \"She's on the deck,\nhaving orange juice. I guess it's the old gag about diet, eh?\"\n\nMy attention wandered about the salon. Most of the seats were\noccupied. At the Captain's table I saw the objects of my search:\nGeorge Prince and his sister, one on each side of the Captain. I saw\nGeorge Prince in the life now as a man who looked hardly twenty-five.\nHe was at this moment evidently in a gay mood. His clean-cut, handsome\nprofile, with its poetic dark curls, was turned toward me. There\nseemed little of the villain about him.\n\nAnd I saw Anita Prince now as a dark-haired, black-eyed little beauty,\nin feature resembling her brother very strongly. She presently\nfinished her meal. She rose, with him after her. She was dressed in\nEarth-fashion--white blouse and dark jacket, wide, knee-length\ntrousers of gray, with a red sash her only touch of color. She went\npast me, flashed me a smile.\n\nMy heart was pounding. I answered her greeting, and met George\nPrince's casual gaze. He, too, smiled, as though to signify that his\nsister had told him of the service I had done her. Or was his smile an\nironical memory of how he had eluded me this morning when I chased\nhim?\n\nI gazed after his small white-suited figure as he followed Anita from\nthe salon. And thinking of her, I prayed that Carter and Halsey might\nbe wrong. Whatever plotting against the Grantline Expedition might be\ngoing on, I hoped that George Prince was innocent of it. Yet I knew in\nmy heart it was a futile hope. Prince had been the eavesdropper\noutside the radio room. I could not doubt it. But that his sister must\nbe ignorant of what he was doing, I was sure.\n\nMy attention was brought suddenly back to the reality of our table. I\nheard Ob Hahn's silky voice. \"We passed quite close to the Moon last\nnight, Mr. Dean.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Snap. \"We did, didn't we? Always do--it's a technical\nproblem of the exigencies of interstellar navigation. Explain it to\nthem, Gregg. You're an expert.\"\n\nI waved it away with a laugh. There was a brief silence. I could not\nhelp noticing Sir Arthur Coniston's queer look, and I have never seen\nso keen a glance as Rance Rankin shot at me. Were all three people\naware of Grantline's treasure on the Moon? It suddenly seemed so. I\nwished fervently at that instant that the ten days of this voyage were\nover. Captain Carter was right. Coming back we should have a cordon of\nInterplanetary Police aboard.\n\nSir Arthur broke the awkward silence. \"Magnificent sight, the Moon,\nfrom so close--though I was too much afraid of pressure sickness to be\nup to see it.\"\n\nI had nearly finished my hasty meal when another incident shocked me.\nThe two other passengers at our table came in and took their seats. A\nMartian girl and man. The girl had the seat at my left, with the man\nbeside her. All Martians are tall. The girl was about my own height.\nThat is, six feet, two inches. The man was seven feet or more. Both\nwore the Martian outer robe. The girl flung hers back. Her limbs were\nencased in pseudomail. She looked, as all Martians like to look, a\nvery warlike Amazon. But she was a pretty girl. She smiled at me with\na keen-eyed, direct gaze.\n\n\"Mr. Dean said at breakfast that you were big and handsome. You are.\"\n\nThey were brother and sister, these Martians. Snap introduced them as\n_Set_ Miko and _Setta_ Moa--the Martian equivalent of Mr. and Miss.\n\nThis Miko was, from our Earth standards, a tremendous, brawny giant.\nNot spindly, like most Martians, this fellow, for all his seven feet\nin height was almost heavy set. He wore a plaited leather jerkin\nbeneath his robe and knee pants of leather out of which his lower legs\nshowed as gray, hairy pillars of strength. He had come into the salon\nwith a swagger, his sword ornament clanking.\n\n\"A pleasant voyage so far,\" he said to me as he started his meal. His\nvoice had the heavy, throaty rasp characteristic of the Martian. He\nspoke perfect English--both Martians and Venus people are by heritage\nextraordinary linguists. Miko and his sister Moa, had a touch of\nMartian accent, worn almost away by living for some years in Greater\nNew York.\n\nThe shock to me came within a few minutes. Miko, absorbed in attacking\nhis meal, inadvertently pushed back his robe to bare his forearm. An\ninstant only, then it dropped to his wrist. But in that instant I had\nseen, upon the gray flesh, a thin sear turned red. A very recent\nburn--as though a pencil ray of heat had caught his arm.\n\nMy mind flung back. Only last night in the city corridor, Snap and I\nhad been followed by a Martian. I had shot at him with a heat ray: I\nthought I had hit him on the arm. Was this the mysterious Martian who\nhad followed us from Halsey's office?\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nShortly after that midday meal I encountered Venza sitting on the\nstarlit deck. I had been in the bow observatory; taken my routine\ncastings of our position and worked them out. I was, I think, of the\n_Planetara's_ officers the most expert handler of the mathematical\ncalculators. The locating of our position and charting the trajectory\nof our course was, under ordinary circumstances, about all I had to\ndo. And it took only a few minutes every twelve hours.\n\nI had a moment with Carter in the isolation of his chart room.\n\n\"This voyage! Gregg, I'm getting like you--too fanciful. We've a normal\ngroup of passengers apparently, but I don't like the look of any of\nthem. That Ob Hahn, at your table--\"\n\n\"Snaky looking fellow,\" I commented. \"He and the Englishman are great\non arguments. Did you have Princes' cabin searched?\"\n\nMy breath hung on his answer.\n\n\"Yes. Nothing unusual among his things. We searched both his room and\nhis sister's.\"\n\nI did not follow that up. Instead I told him about the burn on Miko's\nthick arm.\n\nHe stared. \"I wish we were at Ferrok-Shahn. Gregg, tonight when the\npassengers are asleep, come here to me. Snap will be here, and Dr.\nFrank. We can trust him.\"\n\n\"He knows about--about the Grantline treasure?\"\n\n\"Yes. And so do Balch and Blackstone.\" Balch and Blackstone were our\nfirst and second officers.\n\n\"We'll all meet here, Gregg--say about the zero hour. We must take\nsome precautions.\"\n\nThen he dismissed me.\n\nI found Venza seated alone in a starlit corner of the secluded deck. A\nporthole, with the black heavens and the blazing stars was before her.\nThere was an empty seat nearby.\n\nShe greeted me with the Venus form of jocular, intimate greeting:\n\n\"Hola-lo, Gregg! Sit here with me. I have been wondering when you\nwould come after me.\"\n\nI sat down beside her. \"Why are you going to Mars, Venza? I'm glad to\nsee you.\"\n\n\"Many thanks. But I am glad to see you, Gregg. So handsome a man. Do\nyou know, from Venus to Earth, and I have no doubt on all of Mars, no\nman will please me more.\"\n\n\"Glib tongue,\" I laughed. \"Born to flatter the male--every girl of\nyour world.\" And I added seriously, \"You don't answer my question.\nWhat takes you to Mars?\"\n\n\"Contract. By the stars, what else? Of course, a chance to make a\nvoyage with you--\"\n\n\"Don't be silly, Venza.\"\n\nI enjoyed her. I gazed at her small, slim figure reclining in the deck\nchair. Her long, gray robe parted by design, I have no doubt, to\ndisplay her shapely, satin-sheathed legs. Her black hair was coiled in\na heavy knot at the back of her neck; her carmine lips were parted\nwith a mocking, alluring smile. The exotic perfume of her enveloped\nme.\n\nShe glanced at me sidewise from beneath her sweeping black lashes.\n\n\"Be serious,\" I added.\n\n\"I am serious. Sober. Intoxicated by you, but sober.\"\n\nI said, \"What sort of a contract?\"\n\n\"A theater in Ferrok-Shahn. Good money, Gregg. I'll be there a year.\"\nShe sat up to face me. \"There's a fellow here on the _Planetara_,\nRance Rankin, he calls himself. At our table--a big, good-looking\nblond American. He says he is a magician. Ever hear of him?\"\n\n\"That's what he told me. No, I never heard of him.\"\n\n\"Nor did I. And I thought I had heard of everyone of importance. He is\nlisted for the same theater I am. Nice sort of fellow.\" She paused,\nthen added, \"If he's a professional entertainer, I'm a motor oiler.\"\n\nIt startled me. \"Why do you say that?\"\n\nInstinctively my gaze swept the deck. An Earth woman and child and a\nsmall Venus man were in sight, but not within earshot.\n\n\"Why do you look so furtive?\" she retorted. \"Gregg, there's something\nstrange about this voyage. I'm no fool, nor you, so you must know it\nas well as I do.\"\n\n\"Rance Rankin--\" I prompted.\n\nShe leaned closer toward me. \"He could fool you. But not me--I've\nknown too many magicians.\" She grinned. \"I challenged him to trick\nme. You should have seen him evading!\"\n\n\"Do you know Ob Hahn?\" I interrupted.\n\nShe shook her head. \"Never heard of him. But he told me plenty at\nbreakfast. By Satan, what a flow of words that devil driver can\nmuster! He and the Englishman don't mesh very well, do they?\"\n\nShe stared at me. I had not answered her grin; my mind was too busy\nwith queer fancies. Halsey's words: \"Things are not always what they\nseem--\" Were these passengers masqueraders? Were they put here by\nGeorge Prince? And then I thought of Miko the Martian, and the burn\nupon his arm.\n\n\"Come back, Gregg! Don't go wandering off like that!\" She dropped her\nvoice to a whisper. \"I'll be serious. I want to know what in hell is\ngoing on aboard this ship. I'm a woman and I'm curious. You tell me.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" I parried.\n\n\"I mean a lot of things. What we've just been talking about. And what\nwas the excitement you were in just before breakfast this morning?\"\n\n\"Excitement?\"\n\n\"Gregg, you may trust me.\" For the first time she was wholly serious.\nHer gaze made sure no one was within hearing. She put her hand on my\narm. I could barely hear her whisper: \"I know they might have a ray\nupon us. I'll be careful.\"\n\n\"They?\"\n\n\"Anyone. Something's going on. You know it. You are in it. I saw you\nthis morning, Gregg. Wild-eyed, chasing a phantom--\"\n\n\"You?\"\n\n\"And I heard the phantom! A man's footsteps. A magnetic, deflecting,\ninvisible cloak. You couldn't fool an audience with that, it's too\ncommonplace. If Rance Rankin tried--\"\n\nI gripped her. \"Don't ramble, Venza! You saw me?\"\n\n\"Yes. My stateroom door was open. I was sitting with a cigarette. I\nsaw the purser in the smoking room. He was visible from--\"\n\n\"Wait! Venza, that prowler went through the smoking room!\"\n\n\"I know he did. I could hear him.\"\n\n\"Did the purser hear him?\"\n\n\"Of course. The purser looked up, followed the sound with his gaze. I\nthought that was queer. He never made a move. And then you came along\nand he acted innocent. Why? What's going on, that's what I want to\nknow?\"\n\nI held my breath. \"Venza, where did the prowler run to? Can you--\"\n\nShe whispered calmly, \"Into A20. I saw the door open and close. I even\nthought I could see his blurred outline.\" She added, \"Why should\nGeorge Prince be sneaking around with you after him? And the purser\nacting innocent? And who is this George Prince, anyway?\"\n\nThe huge Martian, Miko, with his sister Moa came strolling along the\ndeck. They nodded as they passed us.\n\nI whispered, \"I can't explain anything now. But you're right, Venza:\nthere is something going on. Listen! Whatever you learn--whatever you\nencounter which looks unusual--will you tell me? I ... well, I do\ntrust you. Really I do, but the whole thing isn't mine to tell.\"\n\nThe somber pools of her eyes were shining. \"You are very lovable,\nGregg. I won't question you.\" She was trembling with excitement.\n\"Whatever it is, I want to be in on it. Here's something I can tell\nyou now. We've two high class gold leaf gamblers aboard. Do you know\nthat?\"\n\n\"Who are they?\"\n\n\"Shac and Dud Ardley. Every detective in Greater New York knows them.\nThey had a wonderful game with that Englishman, Sir Arthur, this\nmorning. Stripped him of half a pound of eight-inch leaves--a neat\nlittle stack. A crooked game, of course. Those fellows are more\nnimble-fingered than Rance Rankin ever dared to be!\"\n\nI sat staring at her. She was a mine of information, this girl.\n\n\"And Gregg, I tried my charms on Shac and Dud. Nice men, but dumb.\nWhatever's going on, they're not in it. They wanted to know what kind\nof a ship this was. Why? Because Shac has a cute little eavesdropping\nmicrophone of his own. He had it working last night. He overheard\nGeorge Prince and that giant Miko arguing about the Moon!\"\n\nI gasped, \"Venza! Softer--\"\n\nAgainst all propriety of this public deck she pretended to drape\nherself upon me. Her hair smothered my face as her lips almost touched\nmy ear.\n\n\"Something about treasure on the Moon. Shac couldn't understand what.\nAnd they mentioned you. Then the purser joined them.\" Her whispered\nwords tumbled over one another. \"A hundred pounds of gold leaf--that's\nthe purser's price. He's with them--whatever it is. He promised to do\nsomething or other for them.\"\n\nShe stopped. \"Well?\" I prompted.\n\n\"That's all. Shac's current was interrupted.\"\n\n\"Tell him to try it again, Venza! I'll talk with him. No! I'd better\nlet him alone. Can you get him to keep his mouth shut?\"\n\n\"I think he might do anything I told him. He's a man!\"\n\n\"Find out what you can.\"\n\nShe drew away from me abruptly. \"There's Anita and George Prince.\"\n\nThey came to the corner of the deck, but turned back. Venza caught my\nlook. And understood it.\n\n\"You do love Anita Prince, Gregg?\" Venza was smiling. \"I wish you....\nI wish some man handsome as you would gaze after me like that.\" She\nturned solemn. \"You may be interested to know, she loves you. I could\nsee it. I knew it when I mentioned you to her this morning.\"\n\n\"Me? Why we've hardly spoken!\"\n\n\"Is it necessary? I never heard that it was.\"\n\nI could not see Venza's face; she stood up suddenly. And when I rose\nbeside her, she whispered, \"We should not be seen talking so long.\nI'll find out what I can.\"\n\nI stared after her slight robed figure as she turned into the lounge\narchway and vanished.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nCaptain Carter was grim. \"So they've bought him off, have they? Go\nbring him in here, Gregg. We'll have it out with him now.\"\n\nSnap, Dr. Frank, Balch, our first officer, and I were in the Captain's\nchart room. It was four P.M. Earth time. We were sixteen hours upon\nour voyage.\n\nI found Johnson in his office in the lounge. \"Captain wants to see\nyou. Close up.\"\n\nHe closed his window upon an American woman passenger who was\ndemanding the details of Martian currency, and followed me forward.\n\"What is it, Gregg?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\nCaptain Carter banged the slide upon us. The chart room was insulated.\nThe hum of the current was obvious. Johnson noticed it. He stared at\nthe hostile faces of the surgeon and Balch. And he tried to bluster.\n\n\"What's this? Something wrong?\"\n\nCarter wasted no words. \"We have information, Johnson, that there's\nsome undercover plot aboard. I want to know what it is. Suppose you\ntell us.\"\n\nThe purser looked blank. \"What do you mean? We've gamblers aboard, if\nthat's--\"\n\n\"To hell with that,\" growled Balch. \"You had a secret interview with\nthat Martian, _Set_ Miko, and with George Prince!\"\n\nJohnson scowled from under his heavy brows, and then raised them in\nsurprise. \"Did I? You mean changing their money? I don't like your\ntone, Balch. I'm not your under-officer!\"\n\n\"But you're under me!\" roared the Captain. \"By God, I'm master here!\"\n\n\"Well, I'm not disputing that,\" said the purser mildly. \"This\nfellow--\"\n\n\"We're in no mood for argument,\" Dr. Frank cut in. \"Clouding the\nissue....\"\n\n\"I won't let it be clouded,\" the Captain exclaimed.\n\nI had never seen Carter so choleric. He added:\n\n\"Johnson, you've been acting suspiciously. I don't give a damn whether\nI've proof of it or not. Did you or did you not meet George Prince and\nthat Martian, last night?\"\n\n\"No, I did not. And I don't mind telling you, Captain Carter, that\nyour tone also is offensive!\"\n\n\"Is it?\" Carter seized him. They were both big men. Johnson's heavy\nface went purplish red.\n\n\"Take your hands--!\" They were struggling. Carter's hands were\nfumbling at the purser's pockets. I leaped, flung an arm around\nJohnson's neck, pinning him.\n\n\"Easy there! We've got you, Johnson!\"\n\nSnap tried to help me. \"Go on! Bang him on the head, Gregg. Now's your\nchance!\"\n\nWe searched him. A heat ray cylinder--that was legitimate. But we\nfound a small battery and eavesdropping device similar to the one\nVenza had mentioned that Shac the gambler was carrying.\n\n\"What are you doing with that?\" the Captain demanded.\n\n\"None of your business! Is it criminal? Carter, I'll have the line\nofficials dismiss you for this! Take your hands off me--all of you!\"\n\n\"Look at this!\" exclaimed Dr. Frank.\n\nFrom Johnson's breast pocket the surgeon drew a folded document. It\nwas a scale drawing of the _Planetara_ interior corridors, the lower\ncontrol rooms and mechanisms. It was always kept in Johnson's safe.\nAnd with it, another document: the ship's clearance papers--the secret\ncode passwords for this voyage, to be used if we should be challenged\nby any Interplanetary Police ship.\n\nSnap gasped, \"My God, that was in my radio room strong box! I'm the\nonly one on this vessel except the Captain who's entitled to know\nthose passwords!\"\n\nOut of the silence, Balch demanded, \"Well, what about it, Johnson?\"\n\nThe purser was still defiant. \"I won't answer your questions, Balch.\nAt the proper time, I'll explain--Gregg Haljan, you're choking me!\"\n\nI eased up. But I shook him. \"You'd better talk.\"\n\nHe was exasperatingly silent.\n\n\"Enough!\" exploded Carter. \"He can explain when we get to port.\nMeanwhile I'll put him where he'll do no more harm. Gregg, lock him in\nthe cage.\"\n\nWe ignored his violent protestations. The cage--in the old days of sea\nvessels on Earth, they called it the brig--was the ship's jail. A\nsteel-lined, windowless room located under the deck in the peak of the\nbow. I dragged the struggling Johnson there, with the amazed watcher\nlooking down from the observatory window at our lunging starlit forms.\n\n\"Shut up, Johnson! If you know what's good for you--\"\n\nHe was making a fearful commotion. Behind us, where the deck narrowed\nat the superstructure, half a dozen passengers were gazing in\nsurprise.\n\n\"I'll have you thrown out of the service, Gregg Haljan!\"\n\nI shut him up finally. And flung him down the ladder into the cage and\nsealed the deck trap door upon him. I was headed back for the chart\nroom when from the observatory came the lookout's voice:\n\n\"An asteroid, Haljan! Officer Blackstone wants you.\"\n\nI hurried to the turret bridge. An asteroid was in sight. We had\nnearly attained our maximum speed now. An asteroid was approaching, so\ndangerously close that our trajectory would have to be altered. I\nheard Blackstone's signals ringing in the control rooms; and met\nCarter as he ran to the bridge with me.\n\n\"That scoundrel! We'll get more out of him, Gregg. By God, I'll put\nthe chemicals on him--torture him--illegal or not!\"\n\nWe had no time for further discussion. The asteroid was rapidly\napproaching. Already, under the glass, it was a magnificent sight. I\nhad never seen this tiny world before--asteroids are not numerous\nbetween the Earth and Mars, or in toward Venus.\n\nAt a speed of nearly a hundred miles a second the asteroid swept into\nview. With the naked eye, at first it was a tiny speck of star-dust\nunnoticeable in the gem-strewn black velvet of space. A speck. Then a\ngleaming dot, silver white, with the light of our Sun upon it.\n\nI stood with Carter and Blackstone on the turret bridge. It was\nobvious, that unless we altered our course, the asteroid would pass\ntoo close for safety. Already we were feeling its attraction; from the\ncontrol rooms came the report that our trajectory was disturbed by\nthis new mass so near.\n\n\"Better make your calculations now, Gregg,\" Blackstone urged.\n\nI cast up the rough elements from the observational instruments in the\nturret. When I had us upon our new course, with the attractive and\nrepulsive plates in the _Planetara's_ hull set in their altered\ncombinations, I went to the bridge again.\n\nThe asteroid hung over our bow quarter. No more than twenty or thirty\nthousand miles away. A giant ball now, filling all that quadrant of\nthe heavens. The configurations of its mountains, its land and water\nareas, were plainly visible.\n\n\"Perfectly habitable,\" Blackstone said. \"But I've searched all over\nthe hemisphere with the glass. No sign of human life--certainly\nnothing civilized--nothing in the fashion of cities.\"\n\nA fair little world, by the look of it. A tiny globe, come from the\nregion beyond Neptune. We swept past the asteroid. The passengers were\nall gathered to view the passing little world. I saw, not far from me,\nAnita, standing with her brother; and the giant figure of Miko with\nthem. Half an hour since this wandering little world had showed\nitself, it swiftly passed, began to dwindle behind us. A huge half\nmoon. A thinner, smaller quadrant. A tiny crescent, like a silver\nbarpin to adorn some lady's breast. And then it was a dot, a point of\nlight indistinguishable among the myriad others hovering in this great\nblack void.\n\nThe incident of the passing of the asteroid was over. I turned from\nthe deck window. My heart leaped. The moment for which all day I had\nbeen subconsciously longing was at hand. Anita was sitting in a deck\nchair, momentarily alone. Her gaze was on me as I glanced her way, and\nshe smiled an invitation for me to join her.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\n\"But, Miss Prince, why are you and your brother going to Ferrok-Shahn?\nHis business--\"\n\nEven as I voiced it, I hated myself for such a question. So nimble in\nthe humble mind that mingled with my rhapsodies of love, was my need\nfor information of George Prince.\n\n\"Oh,\" she said. \"This is pleasure, not business, for George.\" It\nseemed to me that a shadow crossed her face. But it was gone in an\ninstant, and she smiled. \"We have always wanted to travel. We are\nalone in the world, you know--our parents died when we were children.\"\n\nI filled in her pause. \"You will like Mars. So many interesting things\nto see.\"\n\nShe nodded. \"Yes, I understand so. Our Earth is so much the same all\nover, cast all in one mould.\"\n\n\"But a hundred or more years ago, it was not, Miss Prince. I have read\nhow the picturesque Orient, differing from ... well, Greater New York\nor London, for instance--\"\n\n\"Transportation did that,\" she interrupted eagerly. \"Made everything\nthe same--the people all look alike ... dress alike.\"\n\nWe discussed it. She had an alert, eager mind, childlike with its\ncuriosity, yet strangely matured. And her manner was na\u00efvely earnest.\nYet this was no clinging vine, this Anita Prince. There was a\nfirmness, a hint of masculine strength in her chin and in her manner.\n\n\"If I were a man, what wonders I could achieve in this marvelous age!\"\nHer sense of humor made her laugh at herself. \"Easy for a girl to say\nthat,\" she added.\n\n\"You have greater wonders to achieve, Miss Prince,\" I said\nimpulsively.\n\n\"Yes? What are they?\" She had a very frank and level gaze, devoid of\ncoquetry.\n\nMy heart was pounding. \"The wonders of the next generation. A little\nson, cast in your own gentle image--\"\n\nWhat madness, this clumsy, brash talk! I choked it off.\n\nBut she took no offense. The dark rose-petals of her cheeks were\nmantled deeper red, but she laughed.\n\n\"That is true.\" She turned abruptly serious. \"I should not laugh. The\nwonders of the next generation--conquering humans marching on....\" Her\nvoice trailed away. My hand went to her arm. Strange tingling\nsomething which poets call love! It burned and surged through my\ntrembling fingers into the flesh of her forearm.\n\nThe starlight glowed in her eyes. She seemed to be gazing, not at the\nsilver-lit deck, but away into distant reaches of the future.\n\nOur moment. Just a breathless moment given us as we sat there with my\nhand burning her arm, as though we both might be seeing ourselves\njoined in a new individual--a little son, cast in his mother's gentle\nimage and with the strength of his father. Our moment, and then it was\nover. A step sounded. I sat back. The giant gray figure of Miko came\npast, his great cloak swaying, with his clanking sword ornament\nbeneath it. His bullet head, with its close-clipped hair, was hatless.\nHe gazed at us, swaggering past, and turned the deck corner.\n\nOur moment was gone. Anita said conventionally, \"It has been pleasant\nto talk with you, Mr. Haljan.\"\n\n\"But we'll have many more,\" I said. \"Ten days--\"\n\n\"You think we'll reach Ferrok-Shahn on schedule?\"\n\n\"Yes. I think so.... As I was saying, Miss Prince, you'll enjoy Mars.\nA strange, aggressively forward-looking people.\"\n\nAn oppression seemed on her. She stirred in her chair.\n\n\"Yes they are,\" she said vaguely. \"My brother and I know many Martians\nin Greater New York.\" She checked herself abruptly. Was she sorry she\nhad said that? It seemed so.\n\nMiko was coming back. He stopped this time. \"Your brother would see\nyou, Anita. He sent me to bring you to his room.\"\n\nThe glance he shot me had a touch of insolence. I stood up and he\ntowered a head over me.\n\nAnita said, \"Oh yes. I'll come.\"\n\nI bowed. \"I will see you again, Miss Prince. I thank you for a\npleasant half-hour.\"\n\nThe Martian led her away. Her little figure was like a child with a\ngiant. It seemed, as they passed the length of the deck, with me\nstaring after them, that he took her arm roughly. And that she shrank\nfrom him in fear.\n\nAnd they did not go inside. As though to show me that he had merely\ntaken her from me, he stopped at a distant deck window and stood\ntalking to her. Once he picked her up as one would pick up a child to\nshow it some distant object through the window.\n\nWas Anita afraid of this Martian's wooing? Yet was held to him by some\npower he might have over her brother? The vagrant thought struck me.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\nThe rest of that afternoon and evening were a blank confusion to me.\nAnita's words, the touch of my hand on her arm, that vast realm of\nwhat might be for us, like the glimpse of a magic land of happiness\nwhich I had seen in her eyes, and perhaps she had seen in mine--all\nthis surged within me.\n\nAfter wandering about the ship, I had a brief consultation with\nCaptain Carter. He was genuinely apprehensive now. The _Planetara_\ncarried only a half-dozen of the heat-ray projectors, no long range\nweapons, a few side arms, and some old-fashioned, practically\nantiquated weapons of explosives, plus hand projectors with the new\nBenson curve light.\n\nThe weapons were all in Carter's chart room, save the few we officers\nalways carried. Carter was afraid, but of what, he was not sure. He\nhad not thought that our plan to stop at the Moon could affect this\noutward voyage. He had thought that any danger would occur on the way\nback, and then the _Planetara_ would have been adequately guarded and\nmanned with police-soldiers.\n\nBut now we were practically defenseless. I had a moment with Venza,\nbut she had nothing new to communicate. And for half an hour I chatted\nwith George Prince. He seemed a gay, pleasant young man. I could\nalmost have fancied I liked him. Or was it because he was Anita's\nbrother? He told me how he looked forward to traveling with her on\nMars. No, he had never been there before, he said.\n\nHe had a measure of Anita's earnest na\u00efve personality. Or was he a\nvery clever scoundrel, with irony lurking in his soft voice, and a\nchuckle that could so befool me?\n\n\"Well talk again, Haljan. You interest me--I've enjoyed it.\"\n\nHe sauntered away from me, joining the saturnine Ob Hahn, with whom\npresently I heard him discussing religion.\n\nThe arrest of Johnson had caused considerable discussion among the\npassengers. A few had seen me drag him forward to the cage. The\nincident had been the subject of discussion all afternoon. Captain\nCarter had posted a notice to the effect that Johnson's accounts had\nbeen found in serious error, and that Dr. Frank for this voyage would\nact in his stead.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was near midnight when Snap and I closed and sealed the radio room\nand started for the chart room, where we were to meet with Captain\nCarter and the other officers. The passengers had nearly all retired.\nA game was in progress in the smoking room, but the deck was almost\ndeserted.\n\nSnap and I were passing along one of the interior corridors. The\nstateroom doors were all closed. The metal grid of the floor echoed\nour footsteps. Snap was in advance of me. His body suddenly rose in\nthe air. He went like a balloon to the ceiling, struck it gently, and\nall in a heap came floating down and landed on the floor!\n\n\"What in the infernal--\"\n\nHe was laughing as he picked himself up. But it was a brief laugh. We\nknew what had happened: the artificial gravity controls in the base of\nthe ship, which by magnetic force gave us normality aboard, were being\ntampered with! For just this instant, this particular small section of\nthis corridor had been cut off. The slight bulk of the _Planetara_,\nfloating in space, had no appreciable gravity pull on Snap's body, and\nthe impulse of his step as he came to the unmagnetized area of the\ncorridor had thrown him to the ceiling. The area was normal now. Snap\nand I tested it gingerly.\n\nHe gripped me. \"That never went wrong by accident, Gregg! Someone--\"\n\nWe rushed to the nearest descending ladder. In the deserted lower room\nthe bank of dials stood neglected. A score of dials and switches were\nhere, governing the magnetism of different areas of the ship. There\nshould have been a night operator, but he was gone.\n\nThan we saw him lying nearby, sprawled, face down on the floor! In the\nsilence and dim, lurid glow of the fluorescent tubes, we stood holding\nour breaths, peering and listening. No one here.\n\nThe guard was not dead. He lay unconscious from a blow on the head. A\nbrawny fellow. We had him revived in a few moments. A broadcast flash\nof the call buzz brought Dr. Frank from the chart room.\n\n\"What's the matter?\"\n\n\"Someone was here,\" I said hastily, \"experimenting with the magnetic\nswitches. Evidently unfamiliar with them--pulling one or another to\ntest their workings and so see their reactions on the dials.\"\n\nWe told him what had happened to Snap in the corridor; the guard here\nwas no worse off for the episode, save a lump on the head by an\ninvisible assailant. We left him nursing his head, sitting belligerent\nat his post, alert to any danger and armed now with my heat-ray\ncylinder.\n\n\"Strange doings this voyage,\" he told us. \"All the crew knows it. I'll\nstick it out now, but when we get back home I'm done with this star\ntravelin'. I belong on the sea anyway.\"\n\nWe hurried back to the upper level. We would indeed have to plan\nsomething at this chart room conference. This was the first tangible\nattack our adversaries had made.\n\nWe were on the passenger deck headed for the chart room when all three\nof us stopped short, frozen with horror. Through the silent passenger\nquarters a scream rang out! A girl's shuddering, gasping scream.\nTerror in it. Horror. Or a scream of agony. In the silence of the\ndully vibrating ship it was utterly horrible.... It lasted an\ninstant--a single long scream; then was abruptly stilled.\n\nAnd with blood pounding my temples and rushing like ice through my\nveins, I recognized it.\n\nAnita!\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\n\"Good God, what was that?\" Dr. Frank's face had gone white. Snap stood\nlike a statue of horror.\n\nThe deck here was patched as always, with silver radiance from the\ndeck ports. The empty deck chairs stood about. The scream was stilled,\nbut now we heard a commotion inside--the rasp of opening cabin doors;\nquestions from frightened passengers.\n\nI found my voice. \"Anita! Anita Prince!\"\n\n\"Come on!\" shouted Snap. \"In her stateroom, A22!\" He was dashing for\nthe lounge archway.\n\nDr. Frank and I followed. I realized that we passed the deck door and\nwindow of A22. But they were dark, and evidently sealed on the inside.\nThe dim lounge was in a turmoil; passengers standing at their cabin\ndoors.\n\nI shouted, \"Go back to your rooms! We want order here--keep back!\"\n\nWe came to the twin doors of A22 and A20. Both were closed. Dr. Frank\nwas in advance of Snap and me now. He paused at the sound of Captain\nCarter's voice behind us.\n\n\"Was it from in there? Wait a moment!\"\n\nCarter dashed up. He had a large heat-ray projector in his hand. He\nshoved us aside. \"Let me in first. Is the door sealed? Gregg, keep\nthose passengers back!\"\n\nThe door was not sealed. Carter burst into the room. I heard him gasp,\n\"Good God!\"\n\nSnap and I shoved back three or four passengers. And in that instant\nDr. Frank had been in the room and out again.\n\n\"There's been an accident! Get back, Gregg! Snap, help me keep the\ncrowd away.\" He shoved me forcibly.\n\nFrom within, Carter was shouting, \"Keep them out! Where are you,\nFrank? Come back here! Send a flash for Balch!\"\n\nDr. Frank went back into the room and banged the cabin door upon Snap\nand me. I was unarmed. Weapon in hand, Snap forced the panic-stricken\npassengers back to their rooms.\n\nSnap reassured them glibly; but he knew no more about the facts than\nI. Moa, with a nightrobe drawn tight around her thin, tall figure,\nedged up to me.\n\n\"What has happened, _Set_ Haljan?\"\n\nI gazed around for her brother Miko, but did not see him.\n\n\"An accident,\" I said shortly. \"Go back to your room. Captain's\norders.\"\n\nShe eyed me and then retreated. Snap was threatening everybody with\nhis cylinder. Balch dashed up. \"What in hell! Where is Carter?\"\n\n\"In there.\" I pounded on A22. It opened cautiously. I could see only\nCarter, but I heard the murmuring voice of Dr. Frank through the\ninterior connecting door to A20.\n\nThe Captain rasped, \"Get out, Haljan! Oh, is that you, Balch? Come\nin.\" He admitted the older officer and slammed the door upon me again.\nAnd immediately reopened it.\n\n\"Gregg, keep the passengers quieted. Tell them everything's all right.\nMiss Prince got frightened--that's all. Then go to the turret. Tell\nBlackstone what's happened.\"\n\n\"But I don't know what's happened.\"\n\nCarter was grim and white. He whispered, \"I think it may turn out to\nbe murder, Gregg! No, not dead yet.... Dr. Frank is trying ... don't\nstand there like an ass, man. Get to the turret! Verify our\ntrajectory--no--wait....\"\n\nThe Captain was almost incoherent. \"Wait a minute. I don't mean that!\nTell Snap to watch his radio room. Arm yourselves and guard our\nweapons.\"\n\nI stammered, \"If ... if she dies ... will you flash us word?\"\n\nHe stared at me strangely. \"I'll be there presently, Gregg.\"\n\nHe slammed the door upon me.\n\nI followed his orders but it was like a dream of horror. The turmoil\nof the ship gradually quieted. Snap went to the radio room; Blackstone\nand I sat in the tiny chart room; how much time passed, I do not know.\nI was confused. Anita hurt! She might die ... murdered.... But why? By\nwhom? Had George Prince been in his own room when the attack came? I\nthought now I recalled hearing the low murmur of his voice in there\nwith Dr. Frank.\n\nWhere was Miko? It stabbed at me. I had not seen him among the\npassengers in the lounge.\n\nCarter came into the chart room. \"Gregg, you get to bed. You look like\na ghost.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"She's not dead. She may live. Dr. Frank and her brother are with\nher. They're doing all they can.\" He told us what had happened. Anita\nand George Prince had both been asleep, each in his respective room.\nSomeone unknown had opened Anita's corridor door.\n\n\"Wasn't it sealed?\"\n\n\"Yes. But the intruder opened it.\"\n\n\"Burst it? I didn't think it was broken.\"\n\n\"It wasn't broken. The assailant opened it somehow, and assaulted Miss\nPrince--shot her in the chest with a heat ray. Her left lung.\"\n\n\"Shot her?\"\n\n\"Yes. But she did not see who did it. Nor did Prince. Her scream\nawakened him, but the intruder evidently fled out the corridor door of\nA22, the way he entered.\"\n\nI stood weak and shaken at the chart room entrance. Anita--dying,\nperhaps; and all my dreams were fading into a memory of what might\nhave been.\n\nI was glad enough to get away. I would lie down for an hour and then\ngo to Anita's stateroom. I'd demand that Dr. Frank let me see her.\n\nI went to the stern deck where my cubby was located. My mind was\nconfused but some instinct within me made me verify the seals of my\ndoor and window. They were intact. I entered cautiously, switched on\nthe dimmer of the tube lights, and searched the room. It had only a\nbunk, my tiny desk, a chair and clothes robe. There was no evidence of\nany intruder here. I set my door and window alarm. Then I audiphoned\nto the radio room.\n\n\"Snap?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nI told him about Anita. Carter cut in on us from the chart room. \"Stop\nthat, you fools!\"\n\nWe cut off. Fully dressed, I flung myself on my bed. Anita might\ndie....\n\nI must have fallen into a tortured sleep, I was awakened by the sound\nof my alarm buzzer. Someone was tampering with my door! Then the\nbuzzer ceased; the marauder outside must have found a way of\nsilencing it. But it had done its work--awakened me.\n\nI had switched off the light; my cubby was Stygian black. A heat\ncylinder was in the bunk-bracket over my head. I searched for it,\npried it loose softly.\n\nI was fully awake. Alert. I could hear a faint sizzling--someone\noutside trying to unseal the door. In the darkness, cylinder in hand,\nI crept softly from the bunk. Crouched at the door. This time I would\ncapture or kill this night prowler.\n\nThe sizzling was faintly audible. My door seal was breaking. Upon\nimpulse I reached for the door, jerked it open.\n\nNo one there! The starlit segment of deck was empty. But I leaped and\nstruck a solid body, crouching in the doorway. A giant man. Miko!\n\nHis electronized metallic robe burned my hands. I lunged against\nhim--I was almost as surprised as he. I shot, but the stab of heat\nevidently missed him. The shock of my encounter, short-circuited his\nrobe; he materialized in the starlight. A brief, savage encounter. He\nstruck the weapon from my hand. He had dropped his hydrogen torch, and\ntried to grip me. But I twisted away from his hold.\n\n\"So it's you!\"\n\n\"Quiet, Gregg Haljan! I only want to talk.\"\n\nWithout warning, a stab of radiance shot from a weapon in his hand. It\ncaught me. Ran like ice through my veins. Seized and numbed my limbs.\n\nI fell helpless to the deck. Nerves and muscles paralyzed. My tongue\nwas thick and inert. I could not speak, nor move. But I could see Miko\nbending over me, and hear him:\n\n\"I don't want to kill you, Haljan. We need you.\"\n\nHe gathered me up like a bundle in his huge arms; carried me swiftly\nacross the deserted deck.\n\nSnap's radio room in the network under the dome was diagonally\noverhead. A white actinic light shot from it--caught us, bathed us.\nSnap had been awake; had heard the commotion of our encounter.\n\nHis voice rang shrilly: \"Stop! I'll shoot!\" His warning siren rang out\nto alert the ship. His spotlight clung to us.\n\nMiko ran with me a few steps. Then he cursed and dropped me; fled\naway. I fell like a sack of carbide to the deck. My senses faded into\nblackness....\n\n\"He's all right now.\"\n\nI was in the chart room with Captain Carter, Snap and Dr. Frank\nbending over me. The surgeon said,\n\n\"Can you speak now, Gregg?\"\n\nI tried it. My tongue was thick, but it moved. \"Yes.\" I was soon\nrevived. I sat up, with Dr. Frank vigorously rubbing me.\n\n\"I'm all right.\" I told them what had happened.\n\nCaptain Carter said, \"Yes, we know that. And it was Miko also who\nkilled Anita Prince. She told us before she died.\"\n\n\"Died!...\" I leaped to my feet. \"She ... died....\"\n\n\"Yes, Gregg. An hour ago. Miko got into her stateroom and tried to\nforce his love upon her. She repulsed him. He killed her....\"\n\nIt struck me blank. And then with a rush came the thought, \"He says\nMiko killed her\"....\n\nI heard myself stammering, \"Why--why we must get him!\" I gathered my\nwits; a surge of hate swept me; a wild desire for vengeance.\n\n\"Why, by God, where is he? Why don't you go get him? I'll get\nhim--I'll kill him!\"\n\n\"Easy, Gregg!\" Dr. Frank gripped me.\n\nThe Captain said gently. \"We know how you feel, Gregg. She told us\nbefore she died.\"\n\n\"I'll bring him in here to you! But I'll kill him, I tell you!\"\n\n\"No you won't, lad. We don't want him killed, not attacked, even. Not\nyet. We'll explain later.\"\n\nThey sat me down, calming me....\n\nAnita dead. The door of the shining garden was closed. A brief glimpse\ngiven to me and to her of what might have been. And now she was\ndead....\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nI had not been able at first to understand why Captain Carter wanted\nMiko left at liberty. Within me there was that cry of vengeance, as\nthough to strike Miko down would somehow lessen my own grief. Whatever\nCarter's purpose, Snap had not known it. But Balch and Dr. Frank were\nin the Captain's confidence--all three of them working on some plan of\naction.\n\nIt was obvious that at least two of our passengers were plotting with\nMiko and George Prince; trying on this voyage to learn what they could\nabout Grantline's activities on the Moon--scheming doubtless to seize\nthe treasure when the _Planetara_ stopped at the Moon on the return\nvoyage. I thought I could name those masquerading passengers. Ob Hahn,\nsupposedly a Venus mystic. And Rance Rankin, who called himself an\nAmerican magician. Those two, Snap and I agreed, seemed most\nsuspicious. And there was the purser.\n\nI sat for a time on the deck outside the chart room with Snap. Then\nCarter summoned us back, and we sat listening while he, Balch and Dr.\nFrank went on with their conference. Listening to them, I could not\nbut agree that our best plan was to secure evidence which would\nincriminate all who were concerned in the plot. Miko, we were\nconvinced, had been the Martian who followed Snap and me from Halsey's\noffice in Greater New York. George Prince had doubtless been the\ninvisible eavesdropper outside the radio room. He knew, and had told\nthe others that Grantline had found that priceless metal on the Moon\nand that the _Planetara_ would stop there on the way home.\n\nBut we could not incarcerate George Prince for being an eavesdropper.\nNor had we the faintest possible evidence against Ob Hahn or Rankin.\nAnd even the purser would probably be released by the Interplanetary\nCourt of Ferrok-Shahn when it heard our evidence.\n\nThere was only Miko. We could arrest him for the murder of Anita. But\nif we did that now, the others would be put on their guard. It was\nCarter's idea to let Miko remain at liberty for a time and see if we\ncould identify and incriminate his fellows. The murder of Anita\nobviously had nothing to do with any plot against Grantline Moon\ntreasure.\n\n\"Why,\" exclaimed Balch, \"there might be--probably are--huge Martian\ninterests concerned in this thing. These men aboard are only\nemissaries, making this voyage to learn what they can. When they get\nto Ferrok-Shahn, they'll make their report, and then we'll have a real\ndanger on our hands. Why, an outlaw ship could be launched from\nFerrok-Shahn that would beat us back to the Moon--and Grantline is\nentirely without warning of any danger!\"\n\nIt seemed obvious. Unscrupulous criminals in Ferrok-Shahn would be\ndangerous indeed, once these details of Grantline were given them. So\nnow it was decided that in the remaining nine days of our outward\nvoyage, we would attempt to secure enough evidence to arrest all these\nplotters.\n\n\"I'll have them all in the cage when we land,\" declared Carter grimly.\n\"They'll make no report to their principals!\"\n\nAh, the futile plans of men!\n\nYet, at the time, we thought it practical. We were all doubly armed\nnow. Bullet projectors and heat ray cylinders. And we had several\neavesdropping microphones which we planned to use whenever occasion\noffered.\n\nOnly twenty-eight hours of this eventful voyage had passed. The\n_Planetara_ was some six million miles from the Earth; it blazed\nbehind us, a tremendous giant.\n\nThe body of Anita was being made ready for burial. George Prince was\nstill in his stateroom. Glutz, effeminate little hairdresser, who\nwaxed rich acting as beauty doctor for the women passengers, and who,\nin his youth, had been an undertaker, had gone with Dr. Frank to\nprepare the body.\n\nGruesome details. I tried not to think of them. I sat, numbed, in the\nchart room.\n\nAn astronomical burial--there was little precedent for it. I dragged\nmyself to the stern deck where, at five A.M., the ceremony took place.\n\nWe were a solemn little group, gathered there in the checkered\nstarlight with the great vault of the heavens around us. A dismantled\nelectronic projector--necessary when a long range gun was mounted--had\nbeen rigged up in one of the deck ports.\n\nThey brought out the body. I stood apart, gazing reluctantly at the\nsmall bundle, wrapped like a mummy in a dark metallic screen-cloth. A\npatch of black silk rested over her face. Four cabin stewards carried\nher; and beside her walked George Prince. A long black robe covered\nhim, but his head was bare. And suddenly he reminded me of the ancient\nplay-character of Hamlet. His black, wavy hair; his finely chiseled,\npallid face, set now in a stern patrician cast. And staring, I\nrealized that however much of the villain this man might be, at this\ninstant, walking beside the body of his dead sister, he was stricken\nwith grief. He loved that sister with whom he had lived since\nchildhood; and to see him now no one could doubt it.\n\nThe little procession stopped in a patch of starlight by the port.\nThey rested the body on a bank of chairs. The black-robed chaplain,\nroused from his bed and still trembling from excitement of this\nsudden, inexplicable death on board, said a brief, solemn little\nprayer. An appeal: That the Almighty Ruler of all these blazing worlds\nmight guard the soul of this gentle girl whose mortal remains were now\nto be returned to Him.\n\nAh, if ever God seemed hovering close, it was now at this instant, on\nthis starlit deck floating in the black void of space.\n\nThen Carter for just a moment removed the black shroud from her face.\nI saw her brother gaze silently; saw him stoop and implant a\nkiss--and turn away. I did not want to look, but I found myself moving\nslowly forward.\n\nShe lay, so beautiful. Her face, white and calm and peaceful in death.\nMy sight blurred.\n\n\"Easy Gregg,\" Snap was whispering to me. He had his arm around me.\n\"Come on away.\"\n\nThey tied the shroud over her face. I did not see them as they put the\nbody in the tube, sent it through the exhaust chamber and dropped it.\n\nBut a moment later I saw it, a small black, oblong bundle hovering\nbeside us. It was perhaps a hundred feet away, circling us. Held by\nthe _Planetara's_ bulk, it had momentarily become our satellite. It\nswung around us like a moon. Gruesome satellite, by nature's laws\nforever to follow us.\n\nThen from another tube at the bow, Blackstone operated a small\nzed-co-ray projector. Its dull light caught the floating bundle,\nneutralizing its metallic wrappings.\n\nIt swung off at a tangent. Speeding. Falling free in the dome of the\nheavens. A rotating black oblong. But in a moment distance dwindled it\nto a speck. A dull silver dot with the sunlight on it. A speck of\nhuman Earth dust, falling free....\n\nIt vanished. Anita--gone.\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\n\nI turned from the deck. Miko was near me! So he had dared show himself\nhere among us! But I realized he could not be aware we knew he was the\nmurderer. George Prince had been asleep, had not seen Miko with Anita.\nMiko, with impulsive rage had shot the girl and escaped. No doubt now\nhe was cursing himself for having done it. And he could very well\nassume that Anita had died without regaining consciousness to tell who\nhad killed her.\n\nHe gazed at me now. I thought for an instant he was coming over to\ntalk with me. Though he probably considered he was not suspected of\nthe murder of Anita, he realized, of course, that his attack on me was\nknown. He must have wondered what action would be taken.\n\nBut he did not approach me. He moved away and went inside. Moa had\nbeen near him; and as though by prearrangement with him she now\naccosted me.\n\n\"I want to speak to you, _Set_ Haljan.\"\n\n\"Go ahead.\"\n\nI felt an instinctive aversion to this Martian girl. Yet she was not\nunattractive. Over six feet tall, straight and slim. Sleek blond hair.\nRather a handsome face; not gray, like the burly Miko, but pink and\nwhite; stern lipped, but feminine, too. She was smiling gravely now.\nHer blue eyes regarded me keenly. She said gently:\n\n\"A sad occurrence, Gregg Haljan. And mysterious. I would not question\nyou--\"\n\n\"Is that all you have to say?\" I demanded.\n\n\"No. You are a handsome man, Gregg--attractive to women--to any\nMartian woman.\"\n\nShe said it impulsively. Admiration for me was on her face, in her\neyes--a man cannot miss it.\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"I mean, I would be your friend. My brother Miko is so sorry about\nwhat happened between you and him this morning. He only wanted to talk\nto you, and he came to your cubby door--\"\n\n\"With a torch to break its seal,\" I interjected.\n\nShe waved that away. \"He was afraid you would not admit him. He told\nyou he would not harm you.\"\n\n\"And so he struck me with one of your Martian paralyzing rays!\"\n\n\"He is sorry....\"\n\nShe seemed gauging me, trying, no doubt, to find out what reprisal\nwould be taken against her brother. I felt sure that Moa was as active\nas a man in any plan that was under way to capture the Grantline\ntreasure. Miko, with his ungovernable temper, was doing things that\nput their plans in jeopardy.\n\nI demanded, \"What did your brother want to talk to me about?\"\n\n\"Me,\" she said surprisingly. \"I sent him. A Martian girl goes after\nwhat she wants. Did you know that?\"\n\nShe swung on her heel and left me. I puzzled over it. Was that why\nMiko struck me down and was carrying me off? I did not think so. I\ncould not believe that all these incidents were so unrelated to what I\nknew was the main undercurrent They wanted me, had tried to capture me\nfor something else.\n\nDr. Frank found me mooning alone. \"Go to bed, Gregg. You look awful.\"\n\n\"I don't want to go to bed.\"\n\n\"Where's Snap?\"\n\n\"I don't know. He was here a little while ago.\" I had not seen him\nsince the burial of Anita.\n\n\"The Captain wants him,\" he said.\n\nWithin an hour the morning siren would arouse the passengers. I was\nseated in a secluded corner of the deck, when George Prince came\nalong. He went past me, a slight, somber, dark-robed figure. He had on\nhigh, thick boots. A hood was over his head, but as he saw me he\npushed it back and dropped down beside me.\n\nFor a moment he did not speak. His face showed pallid in the dim\nstarlight.\n\n\"She said you loved her.\" His soft voice was throaty with emotion.\n\n\"Yes.\" I said it almost against my will. There seemed a bond springing\nbetween this bereaved brother and me. He added, so softly I could\nbarely hear him: \"That makes you, I think, almost my friend. And you\nthought you were my enemy.\"\n\nI held my answer. An incautious tongue running under emotion is a\ndangerous thing. And I was sure of nothing.\n\nHe went on, \"Almost my friend. Because--we both loved her, and she\nloved us both.\" He was hardly more than whispering. \"And there is\naboard one whom we both hate.\"\n\n\"Miko!\" It burst from me.\n\n\"Yes. But do not say it.\"\n\nAnother silence fell between us. He brushed back the black curls from\nhis forehead. \"Have you an eavesdropping microphone, Haljan?\"\n\nI hesitated. \"Yes.\"\n\n\"I was thinking....\" He leaned closer. \"If, in half an hour, you could\nuse it upon Miko's cabin--I would rather tell you than anyone else.\nThe cabin will be insulated, but I shall find a way of cutting off\nthat insulation so that you can hear.\"\n\nSo George Prince had turned with us. The shock of his sister's\ndeath--himself allied with her murderer--had been too much for him. He\nwas with us!\n\nYet his help must be given secretly. Miko would kill him instantly if\nit became known. He had been watchful of the deck. He stood up now.\n\n\"I think that is all.\"\n\nAs he turned away, I murmured, \"But I do thank you....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe name _Set_ Miko glowed upon the door. It was in a transverse\ncorridor similar to A22. The corridor was forward of the lounge: it\nopened off the small circular library.\n\nThe library was unoccupied and unlighted, dim with only the reflected\nlights from the nearby passages. I crouched behind a cylinder case.\nThe door of Miko's room was in sight.\n\nI waited perhaps five minutes. No one entered. Then I realized that\ndoubtless the conspirators were already there. I set my tiny\neavesdropper on the library floor beside me; connected its little\nbattery; focused its projector. Was Miko's room insulated? I could not\ntell. There was a small ventilating grid above the door. Across its\nopening, if the room was insulated, a blue sheen of radiance would be\nshowing. And there would be a faint hum. But from this distance I\ncould not see or hear such details, and I was afraid to approach\ncloser. Once in the transverse corridor, I would have no place to\nhide, no way of escape. If anyone approached Miko's door, I would be\ntrapped.\n\nI threw the current into my apparatus. I prayed, if it met\ninterference, that the slight sound would pass unnoticed. George\nPrince had said that he would make opportunity to disconnect the\nroom's insulation. He had evidently done so. I picked up the interior\nsounds at once; my headphone vibrated with them. And with trembling\nfingers on the little dial between my knees as I crouched in the\ndarkness behind the cylinder case, I synchronized.\n\n\"Johnson is a fool.\" It was Miko's voice. \"We must have the\npasswords.\"\n\n\"He got them from the radio room.\" A man's voice: I puzzled over it at\nfirst, then recognized it. Rance Rankin.\n\nMiko said, \"He is a fool. Walking around this ship as though with\nletters blazoned on his forehead, 'Watch me.... I need watching.' Hah!\nNo wonder they apprehended him!\"\n\nRankin's voice said: \"He would have turned the papers over to us. I\nwould not blame him too much. What harm--\"\n\n\"Oh, I'll release him,\" Miko declared. \"What harm? That braying ass\ndid us plenty of harm. He has lost the passwords. Better he had left\nthem in the radio room.\"\n\nMoa was in the room. Her voice said, \"We've got to have them. The\n_Planetara_, upon such an important voyage as this, might be watched.\"\n\n\"No doubt it is,\" Rankin said quietly. \"We ought to have the\npasswords. When we are in control of this ship....\"\n\nIt sent a shiver through me. Were they planning to try and seize the\n_Planetara_? Now? It seemed so.\n\n\"Johnson undoubtedly memorized them,\" Moa was saying. \"When we get him\nout--\"\n\n\"Hahn is to do that, at the signal.\" Miko added, \"George could do it\nbetter, perhaps.\"\n\nAnd then I heard George Prince for the first time, \"I'll try.\"\n\n\"No need,\" Miko said unexpectedly.\n\nI could not see what had happened. A look, perhaps, which Prince\ncould not avoid giving this man he had come to hate. Miko doubtless\nsaw it, and the Martian's hot anger leaped.\n\nRankin said hurriedly, \"Stop that!\"\n\nAnd Moa, \"Let him alone, you fool! Sit down!\"\n\nI could hear the sound of a scuffle. A blow--a cry, half suppressed,\nfrom George Prince.\n\nThen Miko: \"I will not hurt him. Craven coward! Look at him! Hating\nme--frightened!\"\n\nI could fancy George Prince sitting there with murder in his heart,\nand Miko taunting him:\n\n\"Hates me now, because I shot his sister!\"\n\nMoa: \"Hush!\"\n\n\"I will not! Why should I not say it? I will tell you something else,\nGeorge Prince. It was not Anita I shot at, but you! I meant nothing\nfor her but love. If you had not interfered--\"\n\nThis was different from what we had figured. George Prince had come in\nfrom his own room, had tried to rescue his sister, and in the scuffle,\nAnita had taken the shot instead of George.\n\n\"I did not even know I had hit her,\" Miko was saying. \"Not until I\nheard she was dead.\" He added sardonically, \"I hoped it was you I had\nhit, George. And I will tell you this: you hate me no more than I hate\nyou. If it were not for your knowledge of ores--\"\n\n\"Is this to be a personal wrangle?\" Rankin interrupted. \"I thought we\nwere here to plan--\"\n\n\"It is planned,\" Miko said shortly. \"I give orders, I do not plan. I\nam waiting now for the moment--\" He checked himself.\n\nMoa said, \"Does Rankin understand that no harm is to come to Gregg\nHaljan?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Rankin said. \"And Dean. We need them, of course. But you cannot\nmake Dean send messages if he refuses, nor make Haljan navigate.\"\n\n\"I know enough to check on them,\" Miko said grimly. \"They will not\nfool me. And they will obey me, have no fear. A little touch of\nsulphuric--\" His laugh was gruesome. \"It makes the most stubborn, very\nwilling.\"\n\n\"I wish,\" said Moa, \"we had Haljan safely hidden. If he is\nhurt--killed--\"\n\nSo that was why Miko had tried to capture me? To keep me safe so that\nI might navigate the ship.\n\nIt occurred to me that I should get Carter at once. A plot to seize\nthe _Planetara_--but when?\n\nI froze with startled horror.\n\nThe diaphragms at my ears rang with Miko's words: \"I have set the time\nfor now--two minutes--\"\n\nIt seemed to startle Rankin and George Prince as much as it did me.\nBoth exclaimed: \"No!\"\n\n\"No? Why not? Everyone is at his post!\"\n\nPrince repeated, \"No!\"\n\nAnd Rankin, \"But can we trust them? The stewards--the crew?\"\n\n\"Eight of them are our own men! You didn't know that, Rankin? They've\nbeen aboard the _Planetara_ for several voyages. Oh, this is no\nquickly planned affair, even though we let you in on it so recently.\nYou and Johnson.... By God!\"\n\nThere was a commotion in the stateroom. I crouched, tense. Miko had\ndiscovered that his insulation had been cut off! He had evidently\nleaped to his feet. I heard a chair overturn. And the Martian's roar:\n\"It's off! Did you do that, Prince? By God, if I thought--\"\n\nMy apparatus went suddenly dead as Miko flung on his insulation. I\nlost my wits in the confusion: I should have instantly taken off my\nvibrations. There was interference: it showed in the dark space of the\nventilator grid over Miko's doorway, a snapping in the air, there--a\nswirl of sparks.\n\nI heard with my unaided ears Miko's roar over his insulation: \"By God,\nthey're listening!\"\n\nThe scream of hand sirens sounded from his stateroom. It rang over the\nship. His signal! I heard it answered from some distant point. And\nthen a shot: a commotion in the lower corridors....\n\nThe attack upon the _Planetara_ had begun!\n\nI was on my feet. The shouts of startled passengers sounded, a turmoil\nbeginning everywhere.\n\nI stood momentarily transfixed. The door of Miko's stateroom burst\nopen. He stood there, with Rankin, Moa and George Prince crowding him.\n\nHe saw me. \"You, Gregg Haljan!\"\n\nHe came leaping at me.\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\n\nI was taken wholly by surprise. There was an instant when I stood\nnumbed, fumbling for a weapon at my belt, undecided whether to run or\nstand my ground. Miko was no more than twenty feet from me. He checked\nhis forward rush. The light from an overhead tube was on him: I saw in\nhis hand the cylinder projector of his paralyzing ray.\n\nI plucked my heat cylinder from my belt, and fired without taking aim.\nMy tiny heat beam flashed. I must have grazed Miko's hand. His roar of\nanger and pain rang out over the turmoil. He dropped his weapon; then\nstooped to pick it up. But Moa forestalled him. She leaped and seized\nit.\n\n\"Careful! Fool, you promised not to harm him!\"\n\nA confusion of swift action. Rankin had turned and darted away. I saw\nGeorge Prince stumbling half in front of the struggling Miko and Moa.\nAnd I heard footsteps beside me. A hand gripped me, jerked at me.\n\nOver the turmoil, Prince's voice sounded: \"Gregg Haljan!\"\n\nI recall that I had the impression that Prince was frightened; he had\nhalf fallen in front of Miko. And there was Miko's voice: \"Let go of\nme!\"\n\nIt was Balch gripping me. \"Gregg! This way--run! Get out of here!\nHe'll kill you with that ray!\"\n\nMiko's ray flashed, but George Prince had knocked his arm. I did not\ndare fire again. Prince was in the way. Balch, who was unarmed, shoved\nme violently back.\n\n\"Gregg! The chart room!\"\n\nI turned and ran, with Balch after me. Prince had fallen or been\nfelled by Miko. A flash followed me from Miko's weapon, but again it\nmissed. He did not pursue me. Instead he ran the other way, through\nthe portside door of the library.\n\nBalch and I found ourselves in the library. Shouting, frightened\npassengers were everywhere. The place was in wild confusion, the whole\nship ringing now with shouts.\n\n\"To the chart room, Gregg!\"\n\nI called to the passengers, \"Go back to your rooms!\"\n\nI followed Balch. We ran through the archway to the deck. In the\nstarlight I saw figures scurrying aft, but none were near us. The deck\nforward was dim with heavy shadows. The oval windows and door of the\nchart room were blue-yellow from the tube lights inside. No one seemed\non the deck there. And then as we approached, I saw further forward in\nthe bow, the trap door to the cage standing open. Johnson had been\nreleased.\n\nFrom one of the chart room windows a heat ray sizzled. It barely\nmissed us. Balch shouted, \"Carter--don't!\"\n\nThe Captain called, \"Oh you, Balch--and Haljan--\"\n\nHe came out on the deck as we rushed up. His left arm was dangling\nlimp.\n\n\"God--this--\" He got no further. From the turret overhead a tiny\nsearch beam came down and disclosed us. Blackstone was supposed to be\non duty up there, with a course master at the controls. But, glancing\nup, I saw, illumined by the turret lights, the figure of Ob Hahn in\nhis purple-white robe, and Johnson, the purser. And on the turret\nbalcony, two fallen men--Blackstone and the course master.\n\nJohnson was training the spotlight on us. And Hahn fired a Martian\nray. It struck Balch beside me. He dropped.\n\nCarter was shouting, \"Inside--Gregg! Get inside!\"\n\nI stopped to raise up Balch. Another beam came down. A heat ray this\ntime. It caught the fallen Balch full on the chest, piercing him\nthrough. The smell of his burning flesh rose to sicken me. He was\ndead. I dropped his body. Carter shoved me into the chart room.\n\nIn the small, steel-lined room, Carter and I slid the door closed. We\nwere alone here. The thing had come so quickly it had taken Captain\nCarter, like us all, wholly unawares. We had anticipated spying\neavesdroppers, but not this open brigandage. No more than a minute or\ntwo had passed since Miko's siren in his stateroom had given the\nsignal for attack. Carter had been in the chart room. Blackstone was\nin the turret. At the outbreak of confusion, Carter dashed out to see\nHahn releasing Johnson from the cage. From the forward chart room\nwindow now I could see where Hahn with a torch had broken the cage\nseal. The torch lay on the deck. There had been an exchange of shots;\nCarter's arm was paralyzed; Johnson and Hahn had escaped.\n\nCarter was as confused as I. There had simultaneously been an\nencounter up in the turret. Blackstone and the course master were\nkilled. The lookout had been shot from his post in the forward\nobservatory. The body dangled now, twisted half in and half out the\nwindow.\n\nWe could see several of Miko's men--erstwhile members of our crew and\nsteward corps--scurrying from the turret along the upper bridge toward\nthe dark and silent radio room. Snap was up there. But was he? The\nradio room glowed suddenly with dim light, but there was no evidence\nof a fight there. The fighting seemed mostly below the deck, down in\nthe hull corridors. A blended horror of sounds came up to us. Screams,\nshouts and the hissing and snapping of ray weapons. Our crew--such of\nthem as were loyal--were making a stand below. But it was brief.\nWithin a minute it died away. The passengers, amidships in the\nsuperstructure, were still shouting. Then above them Miko's roar\nsounded.\n\n\"Be quiet! Go in your rooms--you will not be harmed.\"\n\nThe brigands in these few minutes were in control of the ship. All but\nthis little chart room, where, with most of the ship's weapons, Carter\nand I were entrenched.\n\n\"God, Gregg, that this should come upon us!\"\n\nCarter was fumbling with the chart room weapons. \"Here, Gregg. Help\nme. What have you got? Heat ray? That's all I had ready.\"\n\nIt struck me then as I helped him make the connections that Carter in\nthis crisis was at best an inefficient commander. His red face had\ngone splotchy purple; his hands were trembling. Skilled as Captain of\na peaceful liner, he was at a loss now. But I could not blame him. It\nis easy to say we might have taken warning, done this or that, and\ncome triumphant through the attack. But only the fool looks backward\nand says, \"I would have done better.\"\n\nI tried to summon my wits. The ship was lost to us unless Carter and I\ncould do something. Our futile weapons! They were all here--four or\nfive heat ray hand projectors that could send a pencil ray a hundred\nfeet or so. I shot one diagonally up at the turret where Johnson was\nleering down at our rear window, but he saw my gesture and dropped\nback out of sight. The heat beam flashed harmlessly up and struck the\nturret room. Then across the turret window came a sheen of\nradiance--an electrobarrage. And behind it, Hahn's suave, evil face\nappeared. He shouted down:\n\n\"We have orders to spare you, Gregg Haljan--or you would have been\nkilled long ago!\"\n\nMy answering shot hit his barrage with a shower of sparks, behind\nwhich he stood unmoved.\n\nCarter handed me another weapon. \"Gregg, try this.\"\n\nI leveled the old explosive projector; Carter crouched beside me. But\nbefore I could press the trigger, from somewhere down the starlit deck\nan electro beam hit me. The little rifle exploded, broke its breech. I\nsank back to the floor, tingling from the shock of the hostile\ncurrent. My hands were blackened from the exploded powder.\n\nCarter seized me. \"No use. Hurt?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nThe stars through the dome windows were swinging. A long swing--the\nshadows and patterns on the starlit deck were all shifting. The\n_Planetara_ was turning. The heavens revolved in a great round sweep\nof movement, then settled as we took our new course.\n\nHahn at the turret controls had swung us. The Earth and the Sun showed\nover our bow quarter. The sunlight mingled red-yellow with the\nbrilliant starlight. Hahn's signals were sounding; I heard them\nanswered from the mechanism rooms down below. Brigands there--in full\ncontrol. The gravity plates were being set to the new positions: We\nwere on our new course. Headed a point or two off the Earthline. Not\nheaded for the Moon? I wondered.\n\nCarter and I were planning nothing. What was there to plan? We were\nunder observation. A Martian paralyzing ray--or an electronic beam,\nfar more deadly than our own puny weapons--would have struck us the\ninstant we tried to leave the chart room.\n\nMy thoughts were interrupted by a shout from down the deck. At a\ncorner of the cabin superstructure some fifty feet from our windows\nthe figure of Miko appeared. A radiance barrage hung about him like a\nshimmering mantle. His voice sounded: \"Gregg Haljan, do you yield?\"\n\nCarter leaped up from where he and I were crouching. Against all\nreason of safety he leaned from the low window, waving his hamlike\nfist.\n\n\"Yield? No! I am in command here, you pirate! Brigand--murderer!\"\n\nI dragged him back sharply. \"For God's sake--\"\n\nHe was spluttering; and over it Miko's sardonic laugh sounded. \"Shall\nwe argue about it?\"\n\nI stood up. \"What do you want to say, Miko?\"\n\nBehind him the tall, thin figure of his sister showed. She was\nplucking at him. He turned violently. \"I won't harm him! Gregg\nHaljan--is this a truce? You will not shoot?\" He was shielding Moa.\n\n\"No,\" I called. \"For a moment, no. A truce. What is it you want to\nsay?\"\n\nI could hear the babble of passengers who were herded in the cabin\nwith brigands guarding them. George Prince, bare-headed, but shrouded\nin his cloak, showed in a patch of light behind Moa. He looked my way\nand then retreated.\n\nMiko called, \"You must yield. We want you, Haljan.\"\n\n\"No doubt,\" I jeered.\n\n\"Alive. It is easy to kill you.\"\n\nI could not doubt that. Carter and I were little more than rats in a\ntrap. But Miko wanted to take me alive: that was not so simple. He\nadded persuasively:\n\n\"We want you to navigate us. Will you?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Will you help us, Captain Carter? Tell your cub, this Haljan, to\nyield.\"\n\nCarter roared, \"Get back from there. There is no truce!\"\n\nI shoved aside his leveled projector. \"Wait a minute, Miko. Navigate\nwhere?\"\n\n\"That is our business. When you come out here, I will give you the\ncourse.\"\n\nI realized that all this parley was a ruse of Miko's to take me alive.\nHe had made a gesture. Hahn, watching him from the turret window,\ndoubtless flashed a signal down to the hull corridors. The magnetizer\ncontrol under the chart room was altered, our artificial gravity cut\noff. I felt the sudden lightness: I gripped the window casement and\nclung. Carter was startled into incautious movement. It flung him out\ninto the room, his arms and legs flailing.\n\nAnd across the chart room, in the opposite window, I felt rather than\nsaw the shape of something. A figure, almost invisible but not quite,\nwas trying to climb in! I flung the empty rifle I was holding. It hit\nsomething solid in the window. In a flare of sparks a blackhooded\nfigure materialized. A man climbing in! His weapon spat. There was a\ntiny electronic flash, deadly silent. The intruder had shot at Carter:\nstruck him. Carter gave one queer scream. He had floated to the floor;\nhis convulsive movement when he was hit hurled him to the ceiling. His\nbody struck; twitched; bounced back and sank inert on the floor grid\nalmost at my feet.\n\nI clung to the casement. Across the room of the weightless room the\nhooded intruder was also clinging. His hood fell back. It was Johnson.\n\n\"Killed him, the bully! Now for you, Mr. Third Officer Haljan!\"\n\nBut he did not dare fire at me. Miko had forbidden it. I saw him reach\nunder his robe, doubtless for a low-powered paralyzing ray. But he\nnever got it out. I had no weapon within reach. I leaned into the\nroom, still holding the casement, and doubled my legs under me. I\nkicked out from the window.\n\nThe force catapulted me across the space across the room like a\nvolplane. I struck the purser. We gripped. Our locked, struggling\nbodies bounced out into the room. We struck the floor, surged up like\nballoons to the ceiling, struck it with a flailing arm or leg and\nfloated back.\n\nGrotesque, abnormal combat! Like fighting in weightless water. Johnson\nclutched his weapon, but I twisted his wrist, held his arm\noutstretched so that he could not aim it. I was aware of Miko's voice\nshouting on the deck outside.\n\nJohnson's left hand was gouging at my face, his fingers digging at my\neyes. We lunged down.\n\nI twisted his wrists. He dropped the weapon and it sank away, I tried\nto reach it but could not.... Then I had him by the throat. I was\nstronger than he, and more agile. I tried choking him, I had his thick\nbull neck within my fingers. He kicked, scrambled, tore and gouged at\nme. Tried to shout, but it ended in a gurgle. And then, as he felt his\nbreath stopped, his hands came up in an effort to tear mine loose.\n\nWe sank again to the floor. We were momentarily upright. I felt my\nfeet touch. I bent my knees. We sank further. And then I kicked\nviolently upward. Our locked bodies shot to the ceiling. Johnson's\nhead was above me. It struck the steel roof of the chart room. A\nviolent blow. I felt him go suddenly limp. I cast him off and,\ndoubling my body, I kicked at the ceiling. It sent me diagonally\ndownward to the window, where I clung.\n\nAnd I saw Miko standing on the deck with a weapon leveled at me!\n\n\n\n\nXIII\n\n\n\"Haljan! Yield or I'll fire! Moa, give me the smaller one.\"\n\nHe had in his hand too large a projector. Its ray would kill me. If he\nwanted to take me alive, he would not fire. I chanced it.\n\n\"No!\" I tried to draw myself beneath the window. An automatic\nprojector was on the floor where Carter had dropped it. I pulled\nmyself down. Miko did not fire. I reached the weapon. The bodies of\nthe Captain and Johnson had drifted together on the floor in the\ncenter of the room.\n\nI hitched myself back to the window. With upraised weapon I gazed\ncautiously out. Miko had disappeared. The deck within my line of\nvision, was empty.\n\nBut was it? Something told me to beware. I clung to the casement,\nready upon the instant to shove myself down. There was a movement in a\nshadow along the deck. Then a figure rose up.\n\n\"Don't fire, Haljan!\"\n\nThe sharp command, half appeal, stopped the pressure of my finger. It\nwas the tall, lanky Englishman. Sir Arthur Coniston, he as called\nhimself. So he too, was one of Miko's band! The light through a dome\nwindow fell full on him.\n\n\"If you fire, Haljan, and kill me--Miko will kill you then, surely.\"\n\nFrom where he had been crouching he could not command my window. But\nnow, upon the heels of his placating words, he abruptly shot. The\nlow-powered ray, had it struck, would have felled me without killing\nme. But it went over my head as I dropped. Its aura made my senses\nreel.\n\nConiston shouted, \"Haljan!\"\n\nI did not answer. I wonder if he would dare approach to see if I had\nbeen hit. A minute passed. Then another. I thought I heard Miko's\nvoice on the deck outside. But it was an aerial, microscopic whisper\nclose beside me.\n\n\"We see you, Haljan. You must yield!\"\n\nTheir eavesdropping vibrations, with audible projection, were upon me.\nI retorted loudly, \"Come and get me! You cannot take me alive!\"\n\nI do protest if this action of mine in the chart room may seem\nbravado. I had no wish to die. There was within me a very healthy\ndesire for life. But I felt, by holding out, that some chance might\ncome wherewith I might turn events against these brigands. Yet reason\ntold me it was hopeless. Our loyal members of the crew were killed, no\ndoubt. Captain Carter and Balch were dead. The lookouts and course\nmasters, also. And Blackstone.\n\nThere remained only Dr. Frank and Snap. Their fate I did not yet know.\nAnd there was George Prince. He, perhaps, would help me if he could.\nBut, at best, he was a dubious ally.\n\n\"You are very foolish, Haljan,\" murmured Miko's voice. And then I\nheard Coniston:\n\n\"See here, why would not a hundred pounds of gold leaf tempt you? The\ncode words which were taken from Johnson--I mean to say, why not tell\nus where they are?\"\n\nSo that was one of the brigands' new difficulties! Snap had taken the\ncode word sheet that time we sealed the purser in the cage.\n\nI said, \"You'll never find them. And when a police ship sights us,\nwhat will you do then?\"\n\nThe chances of a police ship were slight indeed, but the brigands\nevidently did not know that. I wondered again what had become of Snap.\nWas he captured or still holding them off?\n\nI was watching my windows; for at any moment, under the cover of talk,\nI might be assailed.\n\nGravity came suddenly to the room. Miko's voice said: \"We mean well by\nyou, Haljan. There is your normality. Join us. We need you to chart\nour course.\"\n\n\"And a hundred pounds of gold leaf,\" urged Coniston. \"Or more. Why,\nthis treasure--\"\n\nI could hear an oath from Miko. And then his ironic voice. \"We will\nnot bother you, Haljan. There is no hurry. You will be hungry in good\ntime. And sleepy. Then we will come and get you. And a little acid\nwill help you to think differently about us....\"\n\nHis vibrations died away. The pull of gravity in the room was normal.\nI was alone in the dim silence, with the bodies of Carter and Johnson\nhuddled on the grid. I bent to examine them. Both were dead.\n\nMy isolation was not ruse this time. The outlaws made no further\nattack. Half an hour passed. The deck outside, what I could see of it,\nwas vacant. Balch lay dead close outside the chart room door. The\nbodies of Blackstone and the course master had been removed from the\nturret window. As a forward lookout, one of Miko's men was on duty in\nthe nearby tower. Hahn was at the turret's controls. The ship was\nunder orderly handling, heading back upon a new course. For the Earth?\nThe Moon? It did not seem so.\n\nI found, in the chart room, a Benson curve light projector which poor\nCaptain Carter had nearly assembled. I worked on it, trained it\nthrough my rear window along the empty deck; bent it into the lounge\narchway. Upon my grid the image of the lounge interior presently\nfocused. The passengers in the lounge were huddled in a group.\nDisheveled, frightened, with Moa standing watching them. Stewards were\nserving them with a meal.\n\nUpon a bench, bodies were lying. Some were dead. I saw Rance Rankin.\nOthers were evidently only injured. Dr. Frank was moving among them,\nattending them. Venza was there, unharmed. And I saw the gamblers,\nShac and Dud, sitting white-faced, whispering together. And Glutz's\nlittle beribboned, becurled figure on a stool.\n\nGeorge Prince was there, standing against the wall, shrouded in his\nmourning cloak, watching the scene with alert, roving eyes. And by the\nopposite doorway, the huge towering figure of Miko stood on guard. But\nSnap was missing.\n\nA brief glimpse. Miko saw my Benson light. I could have equipped a\nheat ray and fired along the curved Benson light into that lounge. But\nMiko gave me no time.\n\nHe slid the lounge door closed, and Moa leaped to close the one on my\nside. My grid showed only the blank deck and door.\n\nAnother interval. I had made plans. Futile plans! I could get into the\nturret perhaps, and kill Hahn. I had the invisible cloak which Johnson\nwas wearing. I took it from his body. Its mechanism could be repaired.\nWhy, with it I could creep about the ship, kill these brigands one by\none, perhaps. George Prince would be with me. The brigands who had\nbeen posing as the stewards and crew members were unable to navigate;\nthey would obey my orders. There were only Miko, Coniston and Hahn to\nkill.\n\nFrom my window I could gaze up to the radio room. And now, abruptly, I\nheard Snap's voice: \"No! I tell you--no!\"\n\nAnd Miko, \"Very well, then. We'll try this.\"\n\nSo Snap was captured but not killed. Relief swept me. He was in the\nradio room and Miko was with him. But my relief was short-lived. After\na brief interval, there came a moan from Snap. It floated down the\nsilence overhead and made me shudder.\n\nMy Benson beam shot into the radio room. It showed me Snap lying there\non the floor. He was bound with wire. His torso had been stripped. His\nlivid face was ghastly plain in my light.\n\nMiko was bending over him. Miko with a heat cylinder no longer than a\nfinger. Its needle beam played upon Snap's naked chest. I could see\nthe gruesome little trail of smoke rising; and as Snap twisted and\njerked, there on his flesh was the red and blistered trail of the\nviolet ray.\n\n\"Now will you tell?\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\nMiko laughed. \"No? Then I shall write my name a little deeper....\"\n\nA black sear now--a trail etched in the quivering flesh.\n\n\"Oh!\" Snap's face went white as chalk as he pressed his lips together.\n\n\"Or a little acid? This fire-writing does not really hurt? Tell me\nwhat you did with those code words!\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\nIn his absorption Miko did not notice my light. Nor did I have the wit\nto try and fire along it. I was trembling. Snap under torture!\n\nAs the beam went deeper. Snap suddenly screamed. But he ended, \"No! I\nwill send no message for you--\"\n\nIt had been only a moment. In the chart room window beside me again a\nfigure appeared! No image. A solid, living person, undisguised by any\ncloak of invisibility. George Prince had chanced my fire and crept\nupon me.\n\n\"Haljan! Don't attack me.\"\n\nI dropped my light connections. As impulsively I stood up, I saw\nthrough the window the figure of Coniston on the deck watching the\nresult of Prince's venture.\n\n\"Haljan--yield.\"\n\nPrince no more than whispered it. He stood outside on the deck; the\nlow window casement touched his waist. He leaned over it.\n\n\"He's torturing Snap! Call out that you will yield.\"\n\nThe thought had already been in my mind. Another scream from Snap\nfilled me with horror. I shouted, \"Miko! Stop!\"\n\nI rushed to the window and Prince gripped me. \"Louder!\"\n\nI called louder: \"Miko! Stop!\" My upflung voice mingled with Snap's\nagony of protest. Then Miko heard me. His head and shoulders showed up\nthere at the radio room oval.\n\n\"You--Haljan?\"\n\nPrince shouted, \"I have made him yield. He will obey you if you stop\nthat torture.\"\n\nI think that poor Snap must have fainted. He was silent. I called,\n\"Stop! I will do what you command.\"\n\nMiko jeered, \"That is good. A bargain, if you and Dean obey me. Disarm\nhim, Prince, and bring him out.\"\n\nMiko moved back into the radio room. On the deck, Coniston was\nadvancing, but cautiously mistrustful of me.\n\n\"Gregg.\"\n\nGeorge Prince flung a leg over the casement and leaped lightly into\nthe dim chart room. His small slender figure stood beside me, clung to\nme.\n\nA moment, while we stood there together. No ray was upon us. Coniston\ncould not see us, nor could he hear our whispers.\n\n\"Gregg.\"\n\nA different voice; its throaty, husky quality gone. A soft pleading.\n\"Gregg--Gregg, don't you know me? Gregg, dear....\"\n\nWhy, what was this? Not George Prince? A masquerader, yet so like\nGeorge Prince.\n\n\"Gregg don't you know me?\"\n\nClinging to me. A soft touch upon my arm. Fingers, clinging. A surge\nof warm, tingling current was flowing between us.\n\nMy sweep of instant thoughts. A speck of human Earth dust falling\nfree. That was George Prince who had been killed. George Prince's\nbody, disguised by the scheming Carter and Dr. Frank, buried in the\nguise of his sister. And this black-robed figure who was trying to\nhelp me....\n\n\"Anita! Anita darling--\"\n\n\"Gregg, dear one!\"\n\n\"Anita!\" My arms went around her, my lips pressed hers, and felt her\ntremulous eager answer.\n\nThe form of Coniston showed at our window. She cast me off. She said,\nwith her throaty swagger of amused, masculinity:\n\n\"I have him, Sir Arthur. He will obey us.\"\n\nI sensed her warning glance. She shoved me toward the window. She\nsaid ironically, \"Have no fear, Haljan. You will not be tortured, you\nand Dean, if you obey our commands.\"\n\nConiston gripped me. \"You fool! You caused us a lot of trouble. Move\nalong there!\"\n\nHe jerked me roughly through the window. Marched me the length of the\ndeck, out to the stern space, opened the door of my cubby, flung me in\nand sealed the door upon me.\n\n\"Miko will come presently.\"\n\nI stood in the darkness of my tiny room, listening to his retreating\nfootsteps. But my mind was not upon him.\n\nAll the universe, in that instant, had changed for me. Anita was\nalive!\n\n\n\n\nXIV\n\n\nThe giant Miko stood confronting me. He slid my cubby door closed\nbehind him. He stood with his head towering close against my ceiling.\nHis cloak was discarded. In his leather clothes, and with his clanking\nsword ornament, his aspect carried the swagger of a brigand of old. He\nwas bare-headed; the light from one of my tubes fell upon his\ngrinning, leering gray face.\n\n\"So, Gregg Haljan? You have come to your senses at last. You do not\nwish me to write my name on your chest? I would not have done that to\nDean; he forced me. Sit back.\"\n\nI had been on my bunk. I sank back at the gesture of his huge hairy\narm. His forearm was bare now; the sear of a burn on it was plain to\nbe seen. He remarked my gaze.\n\n\"True. You did that, Haljan, in Greater New York. But I bear you no\nmalice. I want to talk to you now.\"\n\nHe cast about for a seat, and took the little stool which stood by my\ndesk. His hand held a small cylinder of the Martian paralyzing ray. He\nrested it beside him on the desk.\n\n\"Now we can talk.\"\n\nI remained silent. Alert. Yet my thoughts were whirling. Anita was\nalive. Masquerading as her brother. And, with the joy of it, came a\nshudder. Above everything, Miko must not know.\n\n\"A great adventure we are upon, Haljan.\"\n\nMy thoughts came back. Miko was talking with an assumption of friendly\ncomradeship. \"All is well--and we need you, as I have said before. I\nam no fool. I have been aware of everything that went on aboard this\nship. You, of all the officers, are most clever at the routine\nmathematics. Is that so?\"\n\n\"Perhaps.\"\n\n\"You are modest.\" He fumbled at a pocket of his jacket, produced a\nscroll-sheaf. I recognized it. Blackstone's figures. The calculation\nBlackstone made of the asteroid we had passed.\n\n\"I am interested in these,\" Miko went on. \"I want you to verify them.\nAnd this.\" He held up another scroll. \"This is the calculation of our\npresent position and our course. Hahn claims he is a navigator. We\nhave set the ship's gravity plates--see, like this.\"\n\nHe handed me the scrolls. He watched me keenly as I glanced over them.\n\n\"Well?\" I said.\n\n\"You are sparing of words, Haljan. By the devils of the airways, I\ncould make you talk! But I want to be friendly.\"\n\nI handed him back the scrolls. I stood up. I was almost within reach\nof his weapon, but with a sweep of his great arm he knocked me back to\nmy bunk.\n\n\"You dare?\" Then he smiled. \"Let us not come to blows!\"\n\nIn truth, physical violence could get me nothing. I would have to try\nguile. And I saw now that his face was flushed and his eyes\nunnaturally bright. He had been drinking alcolite; not enough to\nbefuddle him, but enough to make him triumphantly talkative.\n\n\"Hahn may not be much of a mathematician,\" I suggested. \"But there is\nyour Sir Arthur Coniston.\" I managed a sarcastic grin. \"Is that his\nname?\"\n\n\"Almost. Haljan, will you verify these figures?\"\n\n\"Yes. But why? Where are we going?\"\n\nHe laughed. \"You are afraid I will not tell you! Why should I? This\ngreat adventure of mine is progressing perfectly. A tremendous stake,\nHaljan. A hundred million dollars in gold leaf. There will be fabulous\nriches for all of us--\"\n\n\"But where are we going?\"\n\n\"To that asteroid,\" he said. \"I must get rid of these passengers. I am\nno murderer.\"\n\nWith a half-dozen killings in the recent fight this was hardly\nconvincing. But he was obviously wholly serious. He seemed to read my\nthoughts.\n\n\"I kill only when necessary. We will land upon the asteroid. A perfect\nplace to maroon the passengers. Is it not so? I will give them the\nnecessities of life. They will be able to signal. And in a month or\nso, when we are perfectly safe and finished with our adventure, a\npolice ship no doubt will rescue them.\"\n\n\"And then, from the asteroid,\" I suggested, \"we are going--\"\n\n\"To the Moon, Haljan. What a clever guesser you are! Coniston and Hahn\nare calculating our course. But I have no great confidence in them.\nAnd so I want you.\"\n\n\"You have me.\"\n\n\"Yes. I have you. I would have killed you long ago--I am an impulsive\nfellow--but my sister restrained me.\"\n\nHe gazed at me slyly. \"Moa seems strangely to like you, Haljan.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" I said. \"I'm flattered.\"\n\n\"She still hopes I may really win you to join us,\" he went on. \"Gold\nleaf is a wonderful thing; there would be plenty for you in this\naffair. And to be rich, and have the love of a woman like Moa....\"\n\nHe paused. I was trying cautiously to gauge him, to get from him all\nthe information I could. I said, with another smile, \"That is\npremature, to talk of Moa. I will help you chart your course. But this\nventure, as you call it, is dangerous. A police ship--\"\n\n\"There are not many,\" he declared. \"The chances of our encountering\none are very slim.\" He grinned at me. \"You know that as well as I do.\nAnd we now have those code passwords--I forced Dean to tell me where\nhe had hidden them. If we should be challenged, our password answer\nwill relieve suspicion.\"\n\n\"The _Planetara_,\" I objected, \"being overdue at Ferrok-Shahn, will\ncause alarm. You'll have a covey of patrol ships after you.\"\n\n\"That will be two weeks from now,\" he smiled. \"I have a ship of my own\nin Ferrok-Shahn. It lies there waiting now, manned and armed. I am\nhoping that, with Dean's help, we may be able to flash them a signal.\nIt will join us on the Moon. Fear not for the danger, Haljan. I have\ngreat interests allied with me in this thing. Plenty of money. We have\nplanned carefully.\"\n\nHe was idly fingering his cylinder; he gazed at me as I sat docile on\nmy bunk. \"Did you think George Prince was a leader of this? A mere\nboy. I engaged him a year ago--his knowledge of science is valuable to\nus.\"\n\nMy heart was pounding but I strove not to show it. He went on calmly.\n\n\"I told you I am impulsive. Half a dozen times I have nearly killed\nGeorge Prince, and he knows it.\" He frowned. \"I wish I had killed him\ninstead of his sister. That was an error.\"\n\nThere was a note of real concern in his voice. He added, \"That is\ndone--nothing can change it. George Prince is helpful to me. Your\nfriend Dean, is another. I had trouble with him, but he is docile\nnow.\"\n\nI said abruptly, \"I don't know whether your promise means anything or\nnot, Miko. But Prince said you would use no more torture.\"\n\n\"I won't. Not if you and Dean obey me.\"\n\n\"You tell Dean I have agreed to that. You say he gave you the code\nwords he took from Johnson?\"\n\n\"Yes. There was a fool, for you! That Johnson! You blame me, Haljan,\nfor the death of Carter? You need not. Johnson offered to try and\ncapture you, take you both alive. He killed Carter because he was\nangry with him. A stupid, vengeful fool! He is dead and I'm glad of\nit.\"\n\nMy mind was on Miko's plans. I ventured, \"This treasure on the\nMoon--did you say it was on the Moon?\"\n\n\"Don't play the fool,\" he retorted. \"I know as much about Grantline as\nyou do.\"\n\n\"That's very little.\"\n\n\"Perhaps.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you know more, Miko. The Moon is a big place. Where, for\ninstance, is Grantline located?\"\n\nI held my breath. Would he tell me that? A score of questions--vague\nplans were in my mind. How skilled at mathematics were these brigands?\nMiko, Coniston, Hahn--could I fool them? If I could learn Grantline's\nlocation on the Moon, and keep the _Planetara_ away from it. A\npretended error of charting. Time lost--and perhaps Snap could find an\nopportunity to signal Earth, get help.\n\nMiko answered my question as bluntly as I asked it. \"I don't know\nwhere Grantline is located. But we will find out. He will not suspect\nthe _Planetara_ so when we get close to the Moon, we will signal and\nask him. We can trick him into telling us. You think I do not know\nwhat is on your mind, Haljan? There is a secret code of signals\narranged between Dean and Grantline. I have forced Dean to confess it.\nWithout torture! Prince helped me in that. He persuaded Dean not to\ndefy me. A very persuasive fellow, George Prince. More diplomatic than\nI am. I give him credit for that.\"\n\nI strove to hold my voice calm. \"If I should join you, Miko--my word,\nif I ever gave it, you would find dependable--I would say George\nPrince is very valuable to us. You should rein your temper. He is\nhalf your size--you might some time, without intention, do him\ninjury.\"\n\nHe laughed. \"Moa says so. But have no fear--\"\n\n\"I was thinking,\" I persisted. \"I'd like to have a talk with George\nPrince.\"\n\nAh, my pounding, tumultuous heart! But I was smiling calmly. And I\ntried to put into my voice a shrewd note of cupidity. \"I really know\nvery little about this treasure, Miko. If there were a million or two\nof gold leaf in it for me--\"\n\n\"Perhaps there would be.\"\n\n\"Suppose you let me have a talk with Prince? I have some scientific\nknowledge myself about the powers of this catalyst. Prince's knowledge\nand mine--we might be able to come to a calculation on the value of\nGrantline's treasure. You don't know. You are only assuming.\"\n\nI paused after this glib outburst. Whatever may have been in Miko's\nmind, I cannot say. But abruptly he stood up. I had left my bunk but\nhe waved me back.\n\n\"Sit down. I am not like Moa. I would not trust you just because you\nprotested you would be loyal.\" He picked up his cylinder. \"We will\ntalk again.\" He gestured to the scrolls he had left upon my desk.\n\"Work on those. I will judge you by the results.\"\n\nHe was no fool, this brigand leader.\n\n\"Yes,\" I agreed. \"You want a true course to the asteroid?\"\n\n\"Yes. And by the gods, I warn you, I can check up on you!\"\n\nI said meekly, \"Very well. But you ask Prince if he wants my\ncalculations on Grantline's possibilities.\"\n\nI shot Miko a foxy look as he stood by the door. I added, \"You think\nyou are clever. There is plenty you don't know. Our first night out\nfrom Earth--Grantline's signals--didn't it ever occur to you that I\nmight have some figures on his treasure?\"\n\nIt startled him. \"Where are they?\"\n\nI tapped my forehead. \"You don't suppose I was foolish enough to\nrecord them. You ask Prince if he wants to talk to me. A hundred\nmillion, or two hundred million--it would make a big difference,\nMiko.\"\n\n\"I will think about it.\" He backed out and sealed the door upon me.\n\nBut Anita did not come. I verified Hahn's figures, which were very\nnearly correct. I charted a course for the asteroid; it was almost the\none which had been set.\n\nConiston came for my results. \"I say, we are not so bad as navigators,\nare we? I think we're jolly good, considering our inexperience. Not\nbad at all, eh?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nI did not think it wise to ask him about Prince.\n\n\"Are you hungry, Haljan?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nA steward came with a meal. The saturnine Hahn stood at my door with a\nweapon upon me while I ate. They were taking no chances and they were\nwise not to.\n\nThe day passed. Day and night, all the same of aspect here in the\nstarry vault of space. But with the ship's routine it was day. And\nthen another time of sleep. I slept fitfully, worrying, trying to\nplan. Within a few hours we would be nearing the asteroid.\n\nThe time of sleep was nearly passed. My chronometer marked five A.M.\noriginal Earth starting time. The seal of my cubby door hissed. The\ndoor slowly opened.\n\nAnita!\n\nShe stood there with her cloak around her. A distance away on the\nshadowed deck Coniston was loitering.\n\n\"Anita!\" I whispered it.\n\n\"Gregg, dear!\"\n\nShe turned and gestured to the watching brigand. \"I will not be long,\nConiston.\"\n\nShe came in and half closed the door upon us, leaving it open enough\nso that we could make sure that Coniston did not advance.\n\nI stepped back where he could not see us. \"Anita!\"\n\nShe flung herself into my opened arms.\n\n\n\n\nXV\n\n\nA moment when, beyond the thought of the nearby brigand--or the\npossibility of an eavesdropping ray trained now upon my cubby--a\nmoment while Anita and I held each other, and whispered those things\nwhich could mean nothing to the world, but which were all the world to\nus!\n\nThen it was she whose wits brought us back from the shining fairyland\nof our love, into the sinister reality of the _Planetara_.\n\n\"Gregg, if they are listening--\"\n\nI pushed her away. This brave little masquerader! Not for my life, or\nfor all the lives on the ship, would I consciously have endangered\nher.\n\n\"But Grantline's findings!\" I said aloud. \"In his message--see here,\nPrince--\"\n\nConiston was too far away on the deck to hear us. Anita went to my\ndoor again and waved at him reassuringly. I put my ear to the door\nopening and listened at the space across the grid of the ventilator\nover my bunk. The hum of a vibration would have been audible at those\ntwo points. But there was nothing.\n\n\"It's all right,\" I whispered, and she clung to me--so small beside\nme. With the black robe thrown aside, it seemed that I could not miss\nthe curves of her woman's figure. A dangerous game she was playing.\nHer hair had been cut short to the base of her neck, in the fashion of\nher dead brother. Her eyelashes had been clipped: the line of her\nbrows altered. And now, in the light of my tube as it shone upon her\nearnest face, I could remark other changes. Glutz, the little beauty\nspecialist, was in this secret. With plastic skill he had altered the\nset of her jaw--put masculinity here.\n\nShe was whispering: \"It was--was poor George whom Miko shot.\"\n\nI had now the true version of what had occurred. Miko had been forcing\nhis wooing upon Anita. George Prince was a weakling whose only good\nquality was his love for his sister. Some years ago he had fallen into\nevil ways. Been arrested, and then been discharged from his position\nwith the Federated Corporation. He had taken up with evil companions\nin Greater New York. Mostly Martians. And Miko had met him. His\ntechnical knowledge, his training with the Federated Corporation, made\nhim valuable to Miko's enterprise. And so Prince had joined the\nbrigands.\n\nOf all this, Anita had been unaware. She had never liked Miko. Feared\nhim. But it seemed that the Martian had some hold upon her brother,\nwhich puzzled and frightened Anita.\n\nThen Miko had fallen in love with her. George had not liked it. And\nthat night on the _Planetara_, Miko had come and knocked upon Anita's\ndoor, and incautiously she had opened it. He forced himself in. And\nwhen she repulsed him, struggled with him, George had been awakened.\n\nShe was whispering to me now. \"My room was dark. We were all three\nstruggling. George was holding me--the shot came--and I screamed.\"\n\nAnd Miko had fled, not knowing whom his shot had hit in the darkness.\n\n\"And when George died, Captain Carter wanted me to impersonate him. We\nplanned it with Dr. Frank to try and learn what Miko and the others\nwere doing; because I didn't know that poor George had fallen into\nsuch evil ways.\"\n\nShe whispered, \"But I love you, Gregg. I want to be the first to say\nit: I love you--I love you.\"\n\nWe had the sanity to try and plan.\n\n\"Anita, tell Miko we discussed the multiple powers of the catalyst.\nDiscussed how carefully it would have to be transported; how to gauge\nits worth. You'll have to be careful, clever. Don't say too much. Tell\nhim we estimate the value at about a hundred and thirty millions.\"\n\nI repeated what Miko had told me of his plans. She knew all that. And\nSnap knew it. She had a few moments alone with Snap and gave me now a\nmessage from him, \"We'll pull out of this, Gregg.\"\n\nWith Snap she had worked out a plan. There were Snap and I; and Shac\nand Dud Ardley upon whom we could doubtless depend. And Dr. Frank.\nAgainst us were Miko and his sister, and Coniston and Hahn. Of course,\nthere were the members of the crew. But we were numerically the\nstronger when it came to true leadership. Unarmed and guarded now. But\nif we could break loose--recapture the ship....\n\nI sat listening to Anita's eager whispers. It seemed feasible. Miko\ndid not altogether trust George Prince; Anita was now unarmed.\n\n\"But I can make opportunity! I can get one of their ray cylinders, and\nan invisible cloak equipment.\"\n\nThat cloak, that had been hidden in Miko's room when Carter searched\nfor it in A20 was now in the chart room by Johnson's body. It had been\nrepaired now. Anita thought she could get possession of it.\n\nWe worked out the details of the plan. Anita would arm herself, and\ncome and release me. Together, with a paralyzing ray, we could creep\nabout the ship, overcome these brigands, one by one. There were so few\nof the leaders. With them felled, and with us in control of the turret\nand the radio room, we could force the crew to stay at their posts.\nThere were, Anita said, no navigators among Miko's crew. They would\nnot dare oppose us.\n\n\"But it should be done at once, Anita. In a few hours we will be at\nthe asteroid.\"\n\n\"Yes. I will go now and try to get the weapons.\"\n\n\"Where is Snap?\"\n\n\"Still in the radio room. One of the crew guards him.\"\n\nConiston was roaming the ship. He was still loitering on the deck,\nwatching my door. Hahn was in the turret. The morning watch of the\ncrew were at their posts in the hull corridors. The stewards were\npreparing a morning meal. There were nine members of subordinates\naltogether, Anita had calculated. Six of them were in Miko's pay. The\nother three--our own men who had not been killed in the fighting--had\njoined the brigands.\n\n\"And Dr. Frank, Anita?\"\n\nHe was in the lounge. All the passengers were herded there, with Miko\nand Moa alternating on guard.\n\n\"I will arrange it with Venza,\" Anita whispered swiftly. \"She will\ntell the others. Dr. Frank knows about it now. He thinks it can be\ndone.\"\n\nThe possibility of it swept me anew. The brigands were of necessity\nscattered singly about the ship. One by one, creeping under cover of\nan invisible cloak, I could fell them, and replace them without\nalarming others. My thoughts leaped to it. We would strike down the\nguard in the radio room. Release Snap. At the turret we could assail\nHahn, and replace him with Snap.\n\nConiston's voice outside broke in upon us. \"Prince.\"\n\nHe was coming forward. Anita stood in the doorway. \"I have the\nfigures, Coniston. By God, this Haljan is with us! And clever! We\nthink it will total a hundred and thirty millions. What a stake!\"\n\nShe whispered, \"Gregg dear, I'll be back soon. We can do it--be\nready!\"\n\n\"Anita--be careful of yourself! If they should suspect you....\"\n\n\"I'll be careful. In an hour, Gregg, or less, I'll come back.... All\nright, Coniston. Where is Miko? I want to see him. Stay where you are,\nHaljan. In good time Miko will trust you with your liberty. You'll be\nrich like all of us. Never fear.\"\n\nShe swaggered out upon the deck, waved at the brigand, and banged my\ncubby door in my face.\n\nI sat upon my bunk. Waiting. Would she come back? Would she be\nsuccessful?\n\n\n\n\nXVI\n\n\nShe came. I suppose it was no more than an hour: It seemed an eternity\nof apprehension. There was the slight hissing of the seal of my door.\nThe panel slid. I had leaped from my bunk where in the darkness I was\nlying tense.\n\n\"Prince?\" I did not dare say \"Anita.\"\n\n\"Gregg.\"\n\nHer voice. My gaze swept the deck as the panel opened. Neither\nConiston nor anyone else was in sight, save Anita's dark-robed figure\nwhich came into my room.\n\n\"You got it?\" I asked in a low whisper.\n\nI held her for an instant, kissed her. But she pushed me away with\nquick hands. She was breathless.\n\n\"Yes, I have it. Give us a little light--we must hurry!\"\n\nIn the blue dimness I saw that she was holding one of the Martian\ncylinders. The smaller size: it would paralyze but not kill.\n\n\"Only one, Anita?\"\n\n\"Yes. And this--\"\n\nThe invisible cloak. We laid it on my grid, and I adjusted its\nmechanism. I donned it and drew its hood, and threw on its current.\n\n\"All right, Anita?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Can you see me?\"\n\n\"No.\" She had stepped back a foot or two. \"Not from here. But you must\nlet no one approach too close.\"\n\nThen she came forward, put out her hand, fumbled until she found me.\n\nIt was our plan to have me follow her out. Anyone observing us would\nsee only the robed figure of the supposed George Prince, and I would\nescape unnoticed.\n\nThe situation about the ship was almost unchanged. Anita had secured\nthe weapon and the cloak and slipped away to my cubby without being\nobserved.\n\n\"You're sure of that?\"\n\n\"I think so, Gregg. I was careful.\"\n\nMoa was now in the lounge, guarding the passengers. Hahn was asleep in\nthe chart room. Coniston was in the turret. Coniston would be off duty\npresently, Anita said, with Hahn taking his place. There were lookouts\nin the forward and stern watch towers, and a guard upon Snap in the\nradio room.\n\n\"Is he inside the room, Anita?\"\n\n\"Snap? Yes.\"\n\n\"No--the guard.\"\n\n\"The guard was sitting on the spider bridge at the door.\"\n\nThis was unfortunate. That guard could see all the deck clearly. He\nmight be suspicious of George Prince wandering around: it would be\ndifficult to get near enough to assail him. This cylinder, I knew, had\nan effective range of only some twenty feet.\n\n\"Coniston is the sharpest, Gregg. He will be the hardest to get near.\"\n\n\"Where is Miko?\"\n\nThe brigand leader had gone below a few moments ago, down into the\nhull corridor. Anita had seized the opportunity to come to me.\n\n\"We can attack Hahn in the chart room first,\" I whispered. \"And get\nthe other weapons. Are they still there?\"\n\n\"Yes. But the forward deck is very bright, Gregg.\"\n\nWe were approaching the asteroid. Already its light, like a brilliant\nmoon, was brightening the forward deck space. It made me realize how\nmuch haste was necessary.\n\nWe decided to go down into the hull corridors. Locate Miko. Fell him\nand hide him. His nonappearance back on deck would very soon throw the\nothers into confusion, especially now with our impending landing upon\nthe asteroid. And, under cover of this confusion, we would try to\nrelease Snap.\n\nWe were ready. Anita slid my door open. She stepped through, with me\nsoundlessly scurrying after her. The empty, silent deck was\nalternately dark with shadow patches and bright with blobs of\nstarlight. A sheen of the Sun's corona was mingled with it; and from\nforward came the radiance of the asteroid's mellow silver glow.\n\nAnita turned to seal my door; within my faintly humming cloak I stood\nbeside her. Was I invisible in this light? Almost directly over us,\nclose under the dome, the lookout sat in his little tower. He gazed\ndown at Anita.\n\nAmidships, high over the cabin superstructure, the radio room hung\ndark and silent. The guard on its bridge was visible. He too, looked\ndown.\n\nA tense instant. Then I breathed again. There was no alarm. The two\nguards answered Anita's gesture.\n\nAnita said aloud into my empty cubby: \"Miko will come for you\npresently, Haljan. He told me that he wants you at the turret controls\nto land us on the asteroid.\"\n\nShe finished sealing my door and turned away; started forward along\nthe deck. I followed. My steps were soundless in my elastic-bottomed\nshoes. Anita swaggered with a noisy tread. Near the door of the\nsmoking room a small incline passage led downward. We went into it.\n\nThe passage was dimly blue lit. We descended its length, came to the\nmain corridor, which ran the length of the hull. A vaulted metal\npassage, with doors to the control rooms opening from it. Dim lights\nshowed at intervals.\n\nThe humming of the ship was more apparent here. It drowned the light\nhumming of my cloak. I crept after Anita; my hand under the cloak\nclutched the ray weapon.\n\nA steward passed us. I shrank aside to avoid him.\n\nAnita spoke to him. \"Where is Miko, Ellis?\"\n\n\"In the ventilator room, Miss. Prince. There was difficulty with the\nair renewal.\"\n\nAnita nodded and moved on. I could have felled that steward as he\npassed me. Oh, if I only had, how different things might have been!\n\nBut it seemed needless. I let him go, and he turned into a nearby door\nwhich led to the galley.\n\nAnita moved forward. If we could come upon Miko alone! Abruptly she\nturned and whispered, \"Gregg, if other men are with him, I'll draw him\naway. You watch your chance.\"\n\nWhat little things can overthrow one's careful plans! Anita had not\nrealized how close to her I was following. And her turning so\nunexpectedly caused me to collide with her sharply.\n\n\"Oh!\" She exclaimed it involuntarily. Her outflung hand had\nunwittingly gripped my wrist, caught the electrode there. The touch\nburned her, and short-circuited my robe. There was a hiss. My current\nburned out the tiny fuses.\n\nMy invisibility was gone! I stood, a tall, blackhooded figure,\nrevealed to the gaze of anyone who might be near!\n\nThe futile plans of humans! We had planned so carefully! Our\ncalculations, our hopes of what we could do, came clattering now in a\nsudden wreckage around us.\n\n\"Anita! Run!\"\n\nIf I were seen with her, then her own disguise would probably be\ndiscovered. That above everything, would be disaster.\n\n\"Anita, get away from me! I must try it alone!\"\n\nI could hide somewhere, repair the cloak perhaps. Or, since now I was\narmed, why could not I boldly start an assault?\n\n\"Gregg, we must get you back to your cubby!\" She was clinging to me in\npanic.\n\n\"No. You run! Get away from me! Don't you understand? George Prince\nhas no business here with me! They'll kill you!\"\n\n\"Gregg, let's get back to the deck.\"\n\nI pushed at her, both of us in confusion.\n\nFrom behind me there came a shout. That accursed steward! He had\nreturned, to investigate perhaps what George Prince was doing in this\ncorridor. He heard our voices. His shout in the silence of the ship\nsounded horribly loud. The white-cloaked shape of him was in the\nnearby doorway. He stood stricken with surprise at seeing me. And then\nturned to run.\n\nI fired my paralyzing cylinder through my cloak. Got him! He fell. I\nshoved Anita violently.\n\n\"Run! Tell Miko to come--tell him you heard a shout. He won't suspect\nyou!\"\n\n\"But, Gregg--\"\n\n\"You mustn't be found out. You're our only hope, Anita! I'll hide, fix\nthe cloak, or get back to my cubby. We'll try again.\"\n\nIt decided her. She scurried down the corridor. I whirled the other\nway. The steward's shout might not have been heard.\n\nThen realization flashed to me. That steward would be revived. He was\none of Miko's men. He would be revived and tell what he had seen and\nheard. Anita's disguise would be revealed.\n\nA cold-blooded killing, I do protest, went against me. But it was\nnecessary. I flung myself upon him. I beat his skull with the metal of\nmy cylinder.\n\nI stood up. My hood had fallen back from my head. I wiped my bloody\nhands on my useless cloak. I had smashed the cylinder.\n\n\"Haljan!\"\n\nAnita's voice! A sharp note of horror and warning. I became aware that\nin the corridor, forty feet down its dim length, Miko had appeared\nwith Anita behind him. His bullet projector was leveled. It spat at\nme. But Anita had pulled at his arm.\n\nThe explosive report was sharply deafening in the confined space of\nthe corridor. With a spurt of flame the leaden pellet struck over my\nhead against the vaulted ceiling.\n\nMiko was struggling with Anita. \"Prince, you idiot!\"\n\n\"Miko, it's Haljan! Don't kill him--\"\n\nThe turmoil brought members of the crew. From the shadowed oval near\nme they came running. I flung the useless cylinder at them. But I was\ntrapped in the narrow passage.\n\nI might have fought my way out. Or Miko might have shot me. But there\nwas the danger that, in her horror, Anita would betray herself.\n\nI backed against the wall. \"Don't kill me! See, I will not fight!\"\n\nI flung up my arms. And the crew, emboldened and courageous under\nMiko's gaze, leaped on me and bore me down.\n\nThe futile plans of humans! Anita and I had planned so carefully. And\nin a few brief minutes of action it had come only to this!\n\n\n\n\nXVII\n\n\n\"So, Gregg Haljan, you are not as loyal as you pretend!\"\n\nMiko was livid with suppressed anger. They had stripped the cloak from\nme, and flung me back in my cubby. Miko was now confronting me: at the\ndoor Moa stood watching. And Anita was behind her. I sat outwardly\ndefiant and sullen on my bunk. But I was tense and alert, fearful\nstill of what Anita's emotion might betray her into doing.\n\n\"Not so loyal,\" Miko repeated. \"And a fool!\"\n\n\"How did he get out of here? Prince, you came in here!\"\n\nMy heart was wildly thumping. But Anita retorted with a touch of\nspirit, \"I came to tell him what you commanded. To check Hahn's latest\nfigures--and to be ready to take the controls when we approached the\nasteroid.\"\n\n\"Well, how did he get out?\"\n\n\"How should I know?\" she parried. Little actress! Her spirit helped to\nallay my fear. She held her cloak close around her in the fashion they\nhad come to expect from the George Prince who had just buried his\nsister. \"How should I know, Miko? I sealed his door.\"\n\n\"But did you?\"\n\n\"Of course he did,\" Moa put in.\n\n\"Ask your lookouts,\" Anita said. \"They saw me--I waved to them just as\nI sealed the door.\"\n\nI ventured, \"I have been taught to open doors.\" I managed a sly,\nlugubrious smile. \"I shall not try it again, Miko.\"\n\nNothing had been said about my killing of the steward. I thanked my\nconstellations now that he was dead. \"I shall not try it again,\" I\nrepeated.\n\nA glance passed between Miko and his sister. Miko said abruptly, \"You\nseem to realize it is not my purpose to kill you. And you presume upon\nit.\"\n\n\"I shall not again.\" I eyed Moa. She was gazing at me steadily. She\nsaid, \"Leave me with him, Miko....\" She smiled. \"Gregg Haljan, we are\nno more than twenty thousand miles from the asteroid now. The\ncalculations for retarding are now in operation.\"\n\nIt was what had taken Miko below, that and trouble with the\nventilating system, which was soon rectified. But the retarding of the\nship's velocity when nearing a destination required accurate\nmanipulation. These brigands were fearful of their own skill. That was\nobvious. It gave me confidence. I was really needed. They would not\nharm me. Except for Miko's impulsive temper, I was in no danger from\nthem--not now, certainly.\n\nMoa was saying, \"I think I may make you understand, Gregg. We have\ntremendous riches within our grasp.\"\n\n\"I know it,\" I said with sudden thought. \"But there are many with whom\nto divide this treasure....\"\n\nMiko caught my intended implication. \"By the infernal, this fellow may\nhave thought he could seize this treasure for himself! Because he is a\nnavigator!\"\n\nMoa said vehemently, \"Do not be an idiot, Gregg! You could not do it!\nThere will be fighting with Grantline!\"\n\nMy purpose was accomplished. They seemed to see me a willing outlaw\nlike themselves. As though it were a bond between us.\n\n\"Leave me with him,\" said Moa.\n\nMiko acquiesced. \"For a few minutes only.\" He proffered a heat ray\ncylinder but she refused it.\n\n\"I am not afraid of him.\"\n\nMiko swung on me. \"Within an hour we will be nearing the atmosphere.\nWill you take the controls?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nHe set his heavy jaw. His eyes bored into me. \"You're a strange\nfellow, Haljan. I can't make you out. I am not angry now. Do you\nthink, when I am deadly serious, that I mean what I say?\"\n\nHis calm words set a sudden chill over me. I checked my smile.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said.\n\n\"Well then, I will tell you this: not for all of Prince's well-meaning\ninterference, or Moa's liking for you, or my own need of your skill,\nwill I tolerate more trouble from you. The next time, I will kill you.\nDo you believe me?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"That is all I want to say. You kill my men, and my sister says I must\nnot hurt you. I am not a child to be ruled by a woman!\"\n\nHe held his huge fist before my face. \"With these fingers I will twist\nyour neck! Do you believe it?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" I did indeed.\n\nHe swung on his heel. \"Moa wants to try and put sense in your head--I\nhope she does it. Bring him to the lounge when you have finished.\nCome, Prince, Hahn will need us.\" He chuckled grimly. \"Hahn seems to\nfear we will plunge into this asteroid like a wild comet gone suddenly\ntangent!\"\n\nAnita moved aside to let him through the door. I caught a glimpse of\nher set white face as she followed him down the deck. Then Moa's bulk\nblocked the doorway. She faced me.\n\n\"Sit where you are, Gregg.\" She turned and closed the door upon us. \"I\nam not afraid of you. Should I be?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nShe came and sat down beside me. \"If you should attempt to leave this\nroom, the stern lookout has orders to bore you through.\"\n\n\"I have no intention of leaving this room,\" I retorted. \"I do not want\nto commit suicide.\"\n\n\"I thought you did. You seem minded in such a fashion. Gregg, why are\nyou so heedless?\"\n\nI said carefully, \"This treasure--you are many who will divide it. You\nhave all these men on the _Planetara_. And in Ferrok-Shahn, others--\"\n\nI paused. Would she tell me? Could I make her talk of that other\nbrigand ship which Miko had said was waiting on Mars? I wondered if he\nhad been able to signal it. The distance from here to Mars was great;\nyet upon other voyages Snap's signals had gotten through. My heart\nsank at the thought. Our situation here was desperate enough. The\npassengers soon would be cast upon the asteroid: there would be left\nonly Snap, Anita and myself. We might recapture the ship, but I\ndoubted it now. My thoughts were turning to our arrival on the Moon.\nWe three might, perhaps, be able to thwart the attack upon Grantline,\nhold the brigands off until help from the Earth might come.\n\nBut with another brigand ship, fully manned and armed, coming from\nMars, the condition would be immeasurably worse. Grantline had some\ntwenty men, and his camp, I knew, would be reasonably fortified. I\nknew too, that Johnny Grantline would fight to his last man.\n\nMoa was saying, \"I would like to tell you our plans, Gregg.\"\n\nHer gaze was on my face. Keen eyes, but they were luminous now--an\nemotion in them sweeping her. But outwardly she was calm.\n\n\"Well, why don't you tell me?\" I said. \"If I am to help....\"\n\n\"Gregg, I want you with us. Don't you understand. And we are not many,\nreally. My brother and I are guiding this affair. With your help, I\nwould feel differently.\"\n\n\"The ship at Ferrok-Shahn--\"\n\nMy fears were realized. She said, \"I think our signals reached it.\nDean tried and Coniston was checking him.\"\n\n\"You think the ship is coming?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Where will it join us?\"\n\n\"At the Moon. We will be there in thirty hours. Your figures gave\nthat, did they not?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said. \"And the other ship--how fast is it?\"\n\n\"Quite fast. In eight days--perhaps nine, it will reach the Moon.\"\n\nShe seemed willing enough to talk. There was indeed, no reason why she\nshouldn't: I could not, she naturally felt, turn the knowledge to\naccount. Certainly my position seemed desperately helpless.\n\n\"Manned--\" I prompted.\n\n\"About forty men.\"\n\n\"And armed? Long range projectors?\"\n\n\"You ask very avid questions, Gregg!\"\n\n\"Why should I not? Don't you suppose I'm interested?\" I touched her.\n\"Moa, did it ever occur to you, if once you and Miko trusted me--which\nyou don't--I might show more interest in joining you?\"\n\nThe look on her face emboldened me. \"Did you ever think of that, Moa?\nAnd some arrangement for my share of this treasure? I am not like\nJohnson, to be hired for a hundred pounds of gold leaf.\"\n\n\"Gregg, I will see that you get your share. Riches for you and me.\"\n\n\"I was thinking, Moa--when we land at the Moon tomorrow--where is our\nequipment?\"\n\nThe Moon, with its lack of atmosphere, needed special equipment. I had\nnever heard Captain Carter mention what apparatus the _Planetara_ was\ncarrying.\n\nMoa laughed. \"We have located air suits and helmets--a variety of\nsuitable apparatus, Gregg. But we were not foolish enough to leave\nGreater New York on this voyage without our own apparatus. My brother\nand Coniston and Prince--all of us snipped crates of freight consigned\nto Ferrok-Shahn; and Rankin had special baggage marked 'theatrical\napparatus.'\"\n\nI understood it now. These brigands had boarded the _Planetara_ with\ntheir own Moon equipment, disguised as freight and personal baggage.\nShipped in bond, to be inspected by the tax officials of Mars.\n\n\"It is on board now. We will open it when we leave the asteroid,\nGregg. We are well equipped.\"\n\nShe bent toward me. And suddenly her long, lean fingers were gripping\nmy shoulders.\n\n\"Gregg, look at me!\"\n\nI gazed into her eyes. There was passion there; and her voice was\nintense.\n\n\"Gregg, I told you once a Martian girl goes after what she wants. It\nis you I want--\"\n\nNot for me to play upon a woman's emotions! \"Moa, you flatter me.\"\n\n\"I love you.\" She held me off, gazing at me. \"Gregg--\"\n\nI must have smiled. Abruptly she released me.\n\n\"So you think it amusing?\"\n\n\"No. But on Earth--\"\n\n\"We are not on Earth. Nor am I of the Earth!\" She was gauging me\nkeenly. No note of pleading was in her voice: a stern authority, and\nthe passion was swinging to anger.\n\n\"I am like my brother: I do not understand you, Gregg Haljan. Perhaps\nyou think you are clever?\"\n\n\"Perhaps.\"\n\nThere was a moment of silence. \"Gregg, I said I loved you. Have you no\nanswer?\"\n\n\"No.\" In truth, I did not know what sort of answer it would be best to\nmake. Whatever she must have read in my eyes, it stirred her to fury.\nHer fingers with the strength of a man in them, dug into my shoulders.\nHer gaze searched me.\n\n\"You think you love someone else? Is that it?\"\n\nThat was horribly startling; but she did not mean it just that way.\nShe amended, with caustic venom: \"That little Anita Prince! You\nthought you loved her! Was that it?\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\nBut I hardly deceived her. \"Sacred to her memory! Her ratlike little\nface, soft voice like a purring, sniveling cat! Is that what you're\nremembering, Gregg Haljan?\"\n\nI tried to laugh. \"What nonsense!\"\n\n\"Is it? Then why are you cold under my touch? Am I, a girl descended\nfrom the Martian flame-workers, impotent to awaken a man?\"\n\nA woman scorned! In all the universe there could be no more dangerous\nan enemy. An incredible venom shot from her eyes.\n\n\"That miserable mouselike creature! Well for her that my brother\nkilled her.\"\n\nIt struck me cold. If Anita were unmasked, beyond all the menace of\nMiko's wooing, I knew that the venom of Moa's jealousy was a greater\ndanger.\n\nI said sharply, \"Don't be simple, Moa!\" I shook off her grip. \"You\nimagine too much. You forget that I am a man of Earth and you a girl\nof Mars.\"\n\n\"Is that reason why we should not love?\"\n\n\"No. But our instincts are different. Men of Earth are born to the\nchase.\"\n\nI was smiling. With thought of Anita's danger I could find it readily\nin my heart to dupe this Amazon.\n\n\"Give me time, Moa. You attract me.\"\n\n\"You lie!\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\" I gripped her arm with all the power of my fingers.\nIt must have hurt her but she gave no sign; her gaze clung to me\nsteadily.\n\n\"I don't know what to think, Gregg Haljan....\"\n\nI held my grip. \"Think what you like. Men of Earth have been known to\nkill the thing they love.\"\n\n\"You want me to fear you?\"\n\n\"Perhaps.\"\n\nShe smiled scornfully. \"That is absurd.\"\n\nI released her. I said earnestly, \"I want you to realize that if you\ntreat me fairly, I can be of great advantage to this venture. There\nwill be fighting. I am fearless.\"\n\nHer venomous expression was softening. \"I think that is true, Gregg!\"\n\n\"And you need my navigating skill. Even now I should be in the\nturret.\"\n\nI stood up. I half expected she would stop me, but she did not. I\nadded, \"Shall we go?\"\n\nShe stood beside me. Her height brought her face level with mine.\n\n\"I think you will cause no more trouble, Gregg?\"\n\n\"Of course not. I am not wholly witless.\"\n\n\"You have been.\"\n\n\"Well, that is over.\" I hesitated. Then I added, \"A man of Earth does\nnot yield to love while there is work to do. This treasure--\"\n\nI think that of everything I said, this last most convinced her.\n\nShe interrupted, \"That I understand.\" Her eyes were smoldering. \"When\nit is over--when we are rich--then I will claim you, Gregg.\"\n\nShe turned from me. \"Are you ready?\"\n\n\"Yes. No! I must get that sheet of Hahn's last figures.\"\n\n\"Are they checked?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" I picked the sheet up from my desk. \"Hahn is fairly accurate,\nMoa.\"\n\n\"A fool, nevertheless. An apprehensive fool.\"\n\nA comradeship seemed coming between us. It was my purpose to establish\nit.\n\n\"Are we going to maroon Dr. Frank with the passengers?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"But he may be of use to us.\"\n\nMoa shook her head decisively. \"My brother has decided not. We will be\nwell rid of Dr. Frank. Are you ready, Gregg?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nShe opened the door. Her gesture reassured the lookout, who was\nalertly watching the stern watchtower.\n\nI stepped out, and followed her forward along the deck, which now was\nbright with the radiance of the nearby asteroid.\n\n\n\n\nXVIII\n\n\nA fair little world. I had thought so before; and I thought so now as\nI gazed at the asteroid hanging so close before our bow. A huge, thin\ncrescent, with the Sun off to one side behind it. A silver crescent,\ntinged with red. From this near vantage point, all of the little\nglobe's disc was visible. The seas lay in gray patches. The convexity\nof the disc was sharply defined. So small a world! Fair and beautiful,\nshrouded with clouded areas.\n\n\"Where is Miko?\"\n\n\"In the lounge, Gregg?\"\n\n\"Can we stop there?\"\n\nMoa turned into the lounge archway. Strange, tense scene. I saw Anita\nat once. Her robed figure lurked in an inconspicuous corner; her eyes\nwere upon me as Moa and I entered, but she did not move. The\nthirty-odd passengers were huddled in a group. Solemn, white-faced\nmen; frightened women. Some of them were sobbing. One Earth woman--a\nyoung widow--sat holding her little girl, and wailing with\nuncontrolled hysteria. The child knew me. As I appeared now, with my\ngold laced white coat over my shoulders, the little girl seemed to see\nin my uniform a mark of authority. She left her mother and ran to me.\n\n\"You--please, will you help us? My Moms is crying.\"\n\nI sent her gently back. But there came upon me then a compassion for\nthese innocent passengers, fated to have embarked on this ill-fated\nvoyage. Herded here in this cabin, with brigands like pirates of old,\nguarding them. Waiting now to be marooned on an uninhabited asteroid\nroaming in space. A sense of responsibility swept me. I swung upon\nMiko. He stood with a nonchalant grace, lounging against the wall with\na cylinder dangling in his hand. He anticipated me, and was the first\nto speak.\n\n\"So, Haljan, she put some sense into your head? No more trouble? Then\nget into the turret. Moa, stay there with him. Send Hahn here. Where\nis that ass, Coniston? We will be in the atmosphere shortly.\"\n\nI said, \"No more trouble from me, Miko. But these passengers--what\npreparation are you making for them on the asteroid?\"\n\nHe stared in surprise. Then he laughed. \"I am no murderer. The crew is\npreparing food, all we can spare. And tools. They can build themselves\nshelter--they will be picked up in a few weeks.\"\n\nDr. Frank was here. I caught his gaze but he did not speak. On the\nlounge couches there still lay the five bodies. Rankin, who had been\nkilled by Blackstone in the fight; a man passenger killed; a woman and\na man wounded, as well.\n\nMiko added, \"Dr. Frank will take his medical supplies and will care\nfor the wounded. There are other bodies among the crew.\" His gesture\nwas deprecating. \"I have not buried them. We will put them ashore;\neasier that way.\"\n\nThe passengers were all eying me. I said:\n\n\"You have nothing to fear. I will guarantee you the best equipment we\ncan spare.\" I turned to Miko. \"You will give them apparatus with which\nto signal?\"\n\n\"Yes. Get to the turret.\"\n\nI turned away, with Moa after me. Again the little girl ran forward.\n\n\"Come ... speak to my Moms; she is crying.\"\n\nIt was across the cabin from Miko. Coniston had appeared from the\ndeck; it created a slight diversion. He joined Miko.\n\n\"Wait,\" I said to Moa. \"She is afraid of you. This is humanity.\"\n\nI pushed Moa back. I followed the child. I had seen that Venza was\nsitting with the child's weeping mother. This was a ruse to get a word\nwith me.\n\nI stood before the terrified woman while the child clung to my legs.\n\nI said gently, \"Don't be so frightened. Dr. Frank will take care of\nyou. There is no danger; you will be safer on the asteroid than here\non the ship.\" I leaned down and touched her shoulder. \"There is no\ndanger.\"\n\nI was between Venza and the open cabin. Venza whispered swiftly, \"When\nwe are landing, Gregg, I want you to make a commotion--anything--just\nas the women go ashore.\"\n\n\"Why? Of course you will have food, Mrs. Francis.\"\n\n\"Never mind details! An instant--just confusion. Go, Gregg--don't\nspeak now!\"\n\nI raised the child. \"You take care of Mother.\" I kissed her.\n\nFrom across the cabin, Miko's sardonic voice made me turn. \"Touching\nsentimentality, Haljan! Get to your post in the turret!\"\n\nHis rasping note of annoyance brooked no delay. I set the child down.\nI said, \"I will land us in an hour. Depend on it.\"\n\nHahn was at the controls when Moa and I reached the turret.\n\n\"You will land us safely, Haljan?\" he demanded anxiously.\n\nI pushed him away. \"Miko wants you in the lounge.\"\n\n\"You take command here?\"\n\n\"Yes. I am no more anxious for a crash than you are, Hahn.\"\n\nHe sighed with relief. \"That is true, of course. I am no expert at\natmospheric entry.\"\n\n\"Have no fear. Sit down, Moa.\"\n\nI waved to the lookout in the forward watch tower, and got his routine\ngesture. I rang the corridor bells, and the normal signals came\npromptly back.\n\nI turned to Hahn. \"Get along, won't you? Tell Miko that things are all\nright here.\"\n\nHahn's small dark figure, lithe as a leopard in his tight fitting\ntrousers and jacket with his robe now discarded, went swiftly down the\nspider incline and across the deck.\n\n\"Moa, where is Snap? By the infernal--if he has been injured--\"\n\nUp on the radio room bridge, the brigand guard still sat. Then I saw\nthat Snap was out there sitting with him. I waved from the turret\nwindow, and Snap's cheery gesture answered me. His voice carried down\nthrough the silver moonlight: \"Land us safely, Gregg. These weird\namateur navigators!\"\n\nWithin the hour I had us dropping into the asteroid's atmosphere. The\nship heated steadily. The pressure went up. It kept me busy with the\ninstruments and the calculations. But my signals were always promptly\nanswered from below. The brigand crew did its part efficiently.\n\nAt a hundred and fifty thousand feet I shifted the gravity plates to\nthe landing combinations, and started the electronic engines.\n\n\"All safe, Gregg?\" Moa sat at my elbow; her eyes, with what seem a\nglow of admiration in them, followed my busy routine activities.\n\n\"Yes. The crew works well.\"\n\nThe electronic streams flowed out like a rocket tail behind us. The\n_Planetara_ caught their impetus. In the rarefied air, our bow lifted\nslightly, like a ship riding a gentle ground swell. At a hundred\nthousand feet we sailed gently forward, hull down to the asteroid's\nsurface, cruising to seek a landing space.\n\nA little sea was now beneath us. A shadowed sea, deep purple in the\nnight down there. Occasional verdurous islands showed, with the lines\nof white surf marking them. Beyond the sea, a curving coastline was\nvisible. Rocky headlines, behind which mountain foothills rose in\nserrated, verdurous ranks. The sunlight edged the distant mountains;\nand presently this rapidly turning little world brought the sunlight\nforward.\n\nIt was day beneath us. We slid gently downward. Thirty thousand feet\nnow, above a sparkling blue ocean. The coastline was just ahead; green\nwith a lush, tropical vegetation. Giant trees, huge-leaved. Long,\ndangling vines; air plants, with giant pods and vivid orchidlike\nblossoms.\n\nI sat at the turret window, staring through my glasses. A fair, little\nworld, yet obviously uninhabited. I could fancy that all this was\nnewly sprung vegetation. This asteroid had whirled in from the cold of\nthe interplanetary space, far outside our solar system. A few years\nago--as time might be measured astronomically, it was no more than\nyesterday--this fair landscape was congealed white and bleak with a\nsweep of glacial ice. But the seeds of life miraculously were here.\nThe miracle of life! Under the warming, germinating sunlight, the\nverdure had sprung.\n\n\"Can you find landing space, Gregg?\" Moa's question brought back my\nwandering fancies. I saw an upland glade, a level spread of ferns with\nthe forest banked around it. A cliff height nearby, frowning down at\nthe sea.\n\n\"Yes. I can land us there.\" I showed her through the glasses. I rang\nthe sirens, and we spiraled, descending further. The mountain tops\nwere now close beneath us. Clouds were overhead, white masses with\nblue sky behind them. A day of brilliant sunlight. But soon, with our\nforward cruising, it was night. The sunlight dropped beneath the\nsharply convex horizon; the sea and the land went purple.\n\nA night of brilliant stars; the Earth was a blazing blue-red point of\nlight. The heavens visibly were revolving; in an hour or so it would\nbe daylight again.\n\nOn the forward deck now Coniston had appeared, commanding half a dozen\nof the crew. They were carrying up caskets of food and the equipment\nwhich was to be given the marooned passengers. And making ready the\ndisembarking incline, loosening the seals of the side dome windows.\n\nSternward on the deck, by the lounge oval, I could see Miko standing.\nAnd occasionally the roar of his voice at the passengers, sounded.\n\nMy vagrant thoughts flung back into Earth's history. Like this,\nancient travelers of the surface of the sea were herded by pirates to\nwalk the plank, or be put ashore, marooned upon some fair desert\nisland of the tropic Spanish main.\n\nHahn came mounting our turret incline. \"All is well, Gregg Haljan?\"\n\n\"Get to your work,\" Moa told him sharply.\n\nHe retreated, joining the bustle and confusion which now was beginning\non the deck. It struck me--could I turn that confusion to account?\nWould it be possible, now at the last moment, to attack these\nbrigands? Snap still sat outside the radio room doorway. But his guard\nwas alert with upraised projector. And that guard, I saw, in his\nposition, commanded all the deck.\n\nAnd I saw too, as the passengers now were herded in a line from the\nlounge oval, that Miko had roped and bound all of the men, a clanking\nchain connected them. They came like a line of convicts, marching\nforward, and stopped on the open deck near the base of the turret. Dr.\nFrank's grim face gazed up at me.\n\nMiko ordered the women and children in a group beside the chained men.\nHis words to them reached me: \"You are in no danger. When we land, be\ncareful. You will find gravity very different--this is a very small\nworld.\"\n\nI flung on the landing lights; the deck glowed with the blue radiance;\nthe searchbeams shot down beside our hull. We hung now a thousand feet\nabove the forest glade. I cut off the electronic streams. We poised,\nwith the gravity plates set at normal, and only a gentle night breeze\nto give us a slight side drift. This I could control with the lateral\npropeller rudders.\n\nFor all my busy landing routine, my mind was on other things. Venza's\nswift words back there in the lounge. I was to create a commotion\nwhile the passengers were landing. Why? Had she and Dr. Frank some\nlast minute desperate purposes?\n\nI determined I would do what she said. Shout, or mis-order the lights.\nThat would be easy.\n\nI was glad it was night. I had, indeed, calculated our descent so that\nthe landing would be in darkness. But to what purpose? These brigands\nwere very alert. There was nothing I could think of to do which would\navail us anything more than a probable swift death under Miko's anger.\n\n\"Well done, Gregg!\" said Moa.\n\nI cut off the last of the propellers. With scarcely a perceptible jar,\nthe _Planetara_ grounded, rose like a feather, and settled to rest in\nthe glade. The deep purple night with stars overhead was around us. I\nhissed out our interior air through the dome and hull ports, and\nadmitted the night air of the asteroid. My calculations--of necessity\nmere mathematical approximations--proved fairly accurate. In\ntemperature and pressure there was no radical change as the dome\nwindows slid back.\n\nWe had landed. Whatever Venza's purpose, her moment was at hand. I was\ntense. But I was aware also, that beside me Moa was very alert. I had\nthought her unarmed. She was not. She sat back from me; in her hand\nwas a long thin knife blade.\n\nShe murmured tensely, \"You have done your part, Gregg. Well and\nskillfully done. Now we will sit here quietly and watch them land.\"\n\nSnap's guard was standing, keenly watching. The lookouts in the\nforward and stern towers were also armed; I could see them both gazing\nkeenly down at the confusion of the blue lit deck.\n\nThe incline went over the hull side and touched the ground.\n\n\"Enough!\" Miko roared. \"The men first. Hahn, move the women back!\nConiston, pile those caskets to the side. Get out of the way, Prince.\"\n\nAnita was down there. I saw her at the edge of the group of women.\nVenza was near her.\n\nMiko shoved her. \"Get out of the way, Prince. You can help Coniston.\nHave the things ready to throw off.\"\n\nFive of the steward crew were at the head of the incline. Miko shouted\nup at me:\n\n\"Haljan, hold our shipboard gravity normal.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nThe line of men were first to descend. Dr. Frank led them. He flashed\na look of farewell up at me and Snap as he went down the incline with\nthe chained men passengers after him.\n\nMotley procession! Twenty odd, disheveled, half-clothed men of these\nworlds. The changing, lightening gravity on the incline caught them.\nDr. Frank bounded up to the rail under the impetus of his step; caught\nand held himself. Drew himself back. The line swayed. In the dim, blue\nlit glare it seemed unreal, crazy. A grotesque dream of men descending\na plank.\n\nThey reached the forest glade. Stood swaying, afraid at first to move.\nThe purple night crowded them; they stood gazing at this strange\nworld, their new prison.\n\n\"Now the women.\"\n\nMiko was shoving the women to the head of the incline. I could feel\nMoa's gaze upon me. Her knife gleamed in the turret light.\n\nShe murmured again, \"In a few moments you can bring us away, Gregg.\"\n\nI felt like an actor awaiting his cue in the wings of some turgid\ndrama the plot of which he did not know. Venza was near the head of\nthe incline. Some of the women and children were on it. A woman\nscreamed. Her child had slipped from her hand; bounded up over the\nrail and fallen. Hardly fallen--floated down to the ground, with\nflailing arms and legs, landing in the dark ferns unharmed. Its\nterrified wail came up.\n\nThere was a confusion on the incline. Venza, still on the deck, seemed\nto send a look of appeal to the turret. My cue?\n\nI slid my hand to the light switchboard. It was near my knees. I\npulled a switch. The blue lit deck beneath the turret went dark.\n\nI recall an instant of horrible, tense silence, and in the gloom\nbeside me I was aware of Moa moving. I felt a thrill of instinctive\nfear--would she plunge that knife into me?\n\nThe silence of the darkened deck was broken with a confusion of\nsounds. A babble of voices; a woman passenger's scream; shuffling\nfeet; and above it all, Miko's roar:\n\n\"Stand quiet! Everyone! No movement!\"\n\nOn the descending incline there was chaos. The disembarking women were\nclinging to the gang rail; some of them had evidently surged forward\nand fallen. Down on the ground in the purple-shadowed starlight, I\ncould vaguely see the chained line of men. They too, were in\nconfusion, trying to shove themselves toward the fallen women.\n\nMiko roared: \"Light those tubes! Gregg Haljan! By the Almighty, Moa,\nare you up there? What is wrong? The light tubes--\"\n\nDark drama of unknown plot! I wondered if I should try and leave the\nturret. Where was Anita? She had been down there on the deck when I\nflung out the lights.\n\nI think twenty seconds would have covered it all. I had not moved. I\nthought, \"Is Snap concerned with this?\"\n\nMoa's knife could have stabbed me. I felt her lunge against me. And\nsuddenly I was gripping her, twisting her wrist. But she flung the\nknife away. Her strength was almost the equal of my own. Her hand went\nfor my throat, and with the other hand she was fumbling.\n\nThe deck abruptly sprang into light again. Moa had found the switch\nand threw it back.\n\nShe fought me as I tried to reach the switch. I saw down on the deck.\nMiko was gazing up at us. Moa panted, \"Gregg--stop! If he sees you\ndoing this, he'll kill you.\"\n\nThe scene down there was almost unchanged. I had answered my cue. To\nwhat purpose? I saw Anita near Miko. The last of the women were on the\nplank.\n\nI had stopped struggling with Moa. She sat back, panting. And then she\ncalled:\n\n\"Sorry, Miko. It will not happen again.\"\n\nMiko was in a towering rage. But he was too busy to bother with me;\nhis anger swung on those nearest him. He shoved the last of the women\nviolently at the incline. She bounded over. Her body, with the gravity\npull of only a few Earth pounds, sailed in an arc and dropped near\nthe swaying line of men.\n\nMiko swung back. \"Get out of my way!\" A sweep of his huge arm knocked\nAnita sidewise. \"Prince, damn you, help me with those boxes!\"\n\nThe frightened stewards were lifting the boxes, square metal storage\nchests each as long as a man, packed with food, tools, and equipment.\n\n\"Here, get out of my way! All of you!\"\n\nMy breath came again; Anita nimbly retreated before Miko's angry rush.\nHe dashed at the stewards. Three of them held a box. He took it from\nthem; raised it at the top of the incline, poised it over his head an\ninstant, with his massive arms like gray pillars beneath it; and flung\nit. The box catapulted, dropped; and then passing the _Planetara's_\ngravity area, it sailed in a long flat arc over the forest glade and\ncrashed into the purple underbrush.\n\n\"Give me another!\"\n\nThe stewards pushed another at him. Like an angry Titan, he flung it.\nAnd another. One by one the chests sailed out and crashed.\n\n\"There is your food. Go pick it up! Haljan, make ready to ring us\naway!\"\n\nOn the deck lay the dead body of Rance Rankin, which the stewards had\ncarried out. Miko seized it: flung it.\n\n\"There! Go to your last resting place!\"\n\nAnd the other bodies, Balch, Blackstone, Captain Carter, Johnson--Miko\nflung them all. And the course masters and those of our crew who had\nbeen killed.\n\nThe passengers were all on the ground now. It was dim down there. I\ntried to distinguish Venza, but could not. I could see Dr. Frank's\nfigure at the end of the chained line of men. The passengers were\ngazing in horror at the bodies hurtling over them.\n\n\"Ready, Haljan?\"\n\nMoa prompted me. \"Tell him yes!\"\n\nI called, \"Yes!\" Had Venza failed in her unknown purpose? It seemed\nso. On the radio room bridge Snap and his guard stood like silent\nstatues in the blue lit gloom.\n\nThe disembarkation was over.\n\n\"Close the ports!\" Miko commanded.\n\nThe incline came folding up with a clatter. The port and dome windows\nslid closed. Moa hissed against my ear:\n\n\"If you want life, Gregg Haljan, you will start your duties!\"\n\nVenza had failed. Whatever it was, it had come to nothing. Down in the\npurple forest, disconnected now from the ship, the last of our friends\nstood marooned. I could distinguish them through the blur of the\nclosed dome--only a swaying, huddled group was visible. But my fancy\npictured this last sight of them, Dr. Frank, Venza, Shac and Dud\nArdley.\n\nThey were gone. There were left only Snap, Anita and myself.\n\nI was mechanically ringing us away. I heard my sirens sounding down\nbelow, with the answering clangs here in the turret. The _Planetara's_\nrespiratory controls started; the pressure equalizers began operating;\nand the gravity plates began shifting into lifting combinations.\n\nThe ship was hissing and quivering with it, combined with the grating\nof the last of the dome ports. And Miko's command:\n\n\"Lift, Haljan!\"\n\nHahn had been mingling with the confusion of the deck though I had\nhardly noticed him. Coniston had remained below with the crew\nanswering my signals. Hahn stood now with Miko, gazing down through a\ndeck window. Anita was alone at another.\n\n\"Lift, Haljan!\"\n\nI lifted up gently, bow first, with a repulsion of the bow plates. And\nstarted the central electronic engine. Its thrust from the stern moved\nus diagonally over the purple forest trees.\n\nThe glade slid downward and away. I caught a last vague glimpse of\nthe huddled group of marooned passengers, staring up at us. Left to\ntheir fate, alone on this deserted world.\n\nWith the three engines going, we slid smoothly upward. The forest\ndropped, a purple spread of treetops edged with starlight and\nEarthlight. The sharply curving horizon seemed to follow us upward. I\nswung on all the power. We mounted at a forty degree angle, slowly\ncircling, with a bank of clouds over us to the side and the shining\nlittle sea beneath.\n\n\"Very good, Gregg.\" In the turret light Moa's eyes blazed at me. \"I do\nnot know what you meant by darkening the deck lights.\" Her fingers dug\nat my shoulders. \"I will tell my brother it was an error.\"\n\nI said, \"An error--yes.\"\n\n\"I didn't know what it was. But you have me to deal with now. You\nunderstand? I will tell my brother so. You said, 'On Earth a man may\nkill the thing he loves.' A woman of Mars may do that! Beware of me,\nGregg Haljan.\"\n\nHer passion-filled eyes bored into me. Love? Hate? The venom of a\nwoman scorned--a mingling of turgid emotions....\n\nI twisted back from her grip and ignored her. She sat back, silently\nwatching my busy activities: the calculations of the shifting\nconditions of gravity, pressures, temperatures; a checking of the\ninstruments on the board before me.\n\nMechanical routine. My mind went to Venza, back there on the asteroid.\nThe wandering little world was already shrinking to a convex surface\nbeneath us. Venza, with her last unknown play, gone to failure. Had I\nmissed my cue? Whatever my part, it seemed now that I must have\nhorribly misacted it.\n\nThe crescent Earth was presently swinging over our bow. We rocketed\nout of the asteroid's shadow. The glowing, flaming Sun appeared,\nmaking a crescent of the Earth. With the glass I could see our tiny\nMoon, visually seeming to hug the limb of its parent Earth.\n\nWe were on our course to the Moon. My mind flung ahead. Grantline\nwith his treasure, unsuspecting this brigand ship. And suddenly,\nbeyond all thought of Grantline, there came to me a fear for Anita. In\nGod's truth I had been, so far, a very stumbling, inept champion,\ndoomed to failure with everything I tried. Why had I not contrived to\nhave Anita desert at the asteroid? Would it not have been far better\nfor her there, taking her chance for rescue with Dr. Frank, Venza and\nthe others?\n\nBut no! I had, like a fool, never thought of that! Had let her remain\nhere on board at the mercy of these outlaws.\n\nAnd I swore now, that beyond everything, I would protect her.\n\nFutile oath! If I could have seen ahead a few hours! But I sensed the\ncatastrophe. There was a shudder within me as I sat in that turret,\ndocilely guiding us out through the asteroid's atmosphere, heading us\nupon our course for the Moon.\n\n\n\n\nXIX\n\n\n\"Try again. By the infernal, Snap Dean, if you do anything to balk us,\nyou die!\"\n\nMiko scanned the apparatus with keen eyes. How much technical\nknowledge of signaling instruments did this brigand leader have? I was\ntense and cold with apprehension as I sat in a corner of the radio\nroom, watching Snap. Could Miko be fooled? Snap, I knew, was trying to\nfool him.\n\nThe Moon spread close beneath us. My log-chart, computed up to thirty\nminutes past, showed us barely some thirty thousand miles over the\nMoon's surface. A silver quadrant. The sunset caught the Lunar\nmountains, flung slanting shadows over the Lunar plains. All the disc\nwas plainly visible. The mellow Earthlight glowed serene and pale to\nillumine the Lunar night.\n\nThe _Planetara_ was bathed in silver. A brilliant silver glare swept\nthe forward deck, clean white and splashed with black shadows. We had\npartly circled the Moon so as now to approach it from the Earthward\nside.\n\nMiko for a time had been at my side in the turret. I had not seen\nConiston or Hahn of recent hours. I had slept, awakened refreshed, and\nhad a meal. Coniston and Hahn remained below, one or other of them\nalways with the crew to execute my sirened orders. Then Coniston came\nto take my place in the turret, and I went with Miko to the radio\nroom.\n\n\"You are skillful, Haljan.\" A measure of grim approval was in his\nvoice. \"You evidently have no wish to try and fool me in this\nnavigation.\"\n\nI had not, indeed. It is delicate work at best, coping with the\nintricacies of celestial mechanics upon a semicircular trajectory with\nretarding velocity, and with a makeshift crew we could easily have\ncome upon real difficulty.\n\nWe hung at last, hull down, facing the Earthward hemisphere of the\nLunar disc. The giant ball of the Earth lay behind and above us--the\nSun over our stern quarter. With forward velocity almost checked, we\npoised, and Snap began his signals to the unsuspecting Grantline.\n\nMy work momentarily was over. I sat watching the radio room. Moa was\nhere, close beside me. I felt always her watchful gaze, so that even\nthe play of my emotions needed reining.\n\nMiko worked with Snap. Anita too was here. To Miko and Moa it was the\nsomber, taciturn George Prince, shrouded always in his black mourning\ncloak, disinclined to talk; sitting alone, brooding and sullen. This\nis how they thought of Anita.\n\nMiko repeated: \"By the infernal, if you try to fool me, Snap Dean!\"\n\nThe small metal room, with its grid floor and low arched ceiling,\nglared with moonlight through its window. The moving figures of Snap\nand Miko were aped by the grotesque, misshapen shadows of them on the\nwalls. Miko gigantic--a great menacing ogre. Snap small and alert--a\ntrim, pale figure in his tight-fitting white trousers, broad-flowing\nbelt, and white shirt open at the throat. His face was pale and drawn\nfrom lack of sleep and the torture to which Miko had subjected him\nearlier on the voyage. But he grinned at the brigand's words, and\npushed his straggling hair closer under the red eyeshade.\n\nThe room over long periods was deadly silent, with Miko and Snap\nbending watchfully at the crowded banks of instruments. A silence in\nwhich my own pounding heart seemed to echo. I did not dare look at\nAnita, nor she at me. Snap was trying to signal Earth, not the Moon!\nHis main grids were set in the reverse. The infra-red waves, flung\nfrom the bow window, were of a frequency which Snap and I believed\nthat Grantline could not pick up. And over against the wall, close\nbeside me and seemingly ignored by Snap, there was a tiny ultra-violet\nsender. Its faint hum and the quivering of its mirrors had so far\npassed unnoticed.\n\nWould some Earth station pick it up? I prayed so. There was a\nthumbnail mirror here which would bring an answer.\n\nWould some Earth telescope be able to see us? I doubted it. The\npinpoint of the _Planetara's_ infinitesimal bulk would be beyond\nvision.\n\nLong silences, broken only by the faint hiss and murmur of Snap's\ninstruments.\n\n\"Shall I try the graphs, Miko?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nI helped him with the spectro. At every level the plates showed us\nnothing save the scarred and pitted Moon surface. We worked for an\nhour. There was nothing. Bleak cold night on the Moon here beneath us.\nA touch of fading sunlight upon the Apennines. Up near the South Pole,\nTycho with its radiating open rills stood like a grim dark maw.\n\nMiko bent over a plate. \"Something here? Is there?\"\n\nAn abnormality upon the frowning ragged cliffs of Tycho? We thought\nso. But then it seemed not.\n\nAnother hour. No signal came from Earth. If Snap's calls were getting\nthrough we had no evidence of it. Abruptly Miko strode at me from\nacross the room. I went cold and tense; Moa shifted, alert to my every\nmovement. But Miko was not interested in me. A sweep of his clenched\nfist knocked the ultra-violet sender and its coils and mirrors in a\ntinkling crash to the grid at my feet.\n\n\"We don't need that, whatever it is!\" He rubbed his knuckles where the\nviolet waves had tinged them, and turned grimly back to Snap.\n\n\"Where are your ray mirrors? If the treasure lies exposed--\"\n\nThis Martian's knowledge was far greater than we believed. He grinned\nsardonically at Anita. \"If our treasure is here on this hemisphere,\nPrince, we should pick up its rays. Don't you think so? Or is\nGrantline too cautious to leave it exposed?\"\n\nAnita spoke in a careful, throaty drawl. \"The rays came through enough\nwhen we passed here on the way out.\"\n\n\"You should know,\" grinned Miko. \"An expert eavesdropper, Prince, I\nwill say that for you.... Come, Dean, try something else. By God, if\nGrantline does not signal us, I will be likely to blame you--my\npatience is shortening. Shall we go closer, Haljan?\"\n\n\"I don't think it would help,\" I said.\n\nHe nodded. \"Perhaps not. Are we checked?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" We were poised very nearly motionless. \"If you wish an advance,\nI can ring it. But we need a surface destination now.\"\n\n\"True, Haljan.\" He stood thinking. \"Would a zed-ray penetrate those\ncrater cliffs? Tycho, for instance, at this angle?\"\n\n\"It might,\" Snap agreed. \"You think he may be on the northern inner\nTycho?\"\n\n\"He may be anywhere,\" said Miko shortly.\n\n\"If you think that,\" Snap persisted, \"suppose we swing the _Planetara_\nover the South Pole. Tycho, viewed from there--\"\n\n\"And take another quarter day of time?\" Miko sneered. \"Flash on your\nzed-ray; help him hook it up, Haljan.\"\n\nI moved to the lens box of the spectroheliograph. It seemed that Snap\nwas very strangely reluctant. Was it because he knew that the\nGrantline camp lay concealed on the north inner wall of Tycho's giant\nring? I thought so. But Snap flashed a queer look at Anita. She did\nnot see it, but I did. And I could not understand it.\n\nMy accursed, witless incapacity! If only I had taken warning!\n\n\"Here,\" commanded Miko. \"A score of 'graphs with the zed-ray. I tell\nyou I will comb this surface if we have to stay here until our ship\ncomes from Ferrok-Shahn to join us!\"\n\nThe Martian brigands were coming. Miko's signals had been answered. In\nten days the other brigand ship, adequately manned and armed, would be\nhere.\n\nSnap helped me connect the zed-ray. He did not dare even to whisper to\nme, with Moa hovering always so close. And for all Miko's sardonic\nsmiling, we knew that he would tolerate nothing from us now. He was\nfully armed and so was Moa.\n\nI recall that several times Snap endeavored to touch me significantly.\nOh, if only I had taken warning!\n\nWe finished our connecting. The dull gray point of zed-ray gleamed\nthrough the prisms to mingle with the moonlight entering the main\nlens. I stood with the shutter trip.\n\n\"The same interval, Snap?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nBeside me, I was aware of a faint reflection of the zed-ray--a gray\ncathedral shaft crossing the room and falling upon the opposite wall.\nAn unreality there, as the zed-ray faintly strove to penetrate the\nmetal room side.\n\nI said, \"Shall I make the exposure?\"\n\nSnap nodded. But that 'graph was never made. An exclamation from Moa\nmade us all turn. The gamma mirrors were quivering! Grantline had\npicked our signals! With what was undoubtedly an intensified receiving\nequipment which Snap had not thought Grantline able to use, he had\ncaught our faint zed-rays, which Snap was sending only to deceive\nMiko. And Grantline had recognized the _Planetara_, and had released\nhis occulting screens surrounding the ore.\n\nAnd upon their heels came Grantline's message. Not in the secret\nsystem he had arranged with Snap, but unsuspectingly in open code. I\ncould read the swinging mirror, and so could Miko.\n\nAnd Miko decoded it triumphantly aloud:\n\n\"Surprised but pleased your return. Approach Mid-Northern Hemisphere\nregion of Archimedes, forty thousand off nearest Apennine range.\"\n\nThe message broke off. But even its importance was overshadowed. Miko\nstood in the center of the radio room, triumphantly reading the little\nindicator. Its beam swung on the scale, which chanced to be almost\ndirectly over Anita's head. I saw Miko's expression change.... A look\nof surprise, amazement, came over him.\n\n\"Why--\"\n\nHe gasped. He stood staring. Almost stupidly staring, for an instant.\nAnd as I regarded him with fascinated horror, there came upon his\nheavy gray face a look of dawning comprehension. And I heard Snap's\nstartled intake of breath. He moved to the spectro, where the zed-ray\nconnections were still humming.\n\nBut, with a leap, Miko flung him away. \"Off with you! Moa, watch him!\nHaljan, don't move!\"\n\nAgain Miko stood staring. I saw now that he was staring at Anita!\n\n\"Why, George Prince! How strange you look!\"\n\nAnita did not move. She was stricken with horror; she shrank back\nagainst the wall, huddled in her cloak. Miko's sardonic voice came\nagain:\n\n\"How strange you look, Prince!\" He took a step forward. He was grim\nand calm. Horribly calm. Deliberate. Gloating like a great gray\nmonster in human form toying with a fascinated, imprisoned bird.\n\n\"Move just a little, Prince. Let the zed-ray light fall more fully.\"\n\nAnita's head was bare. That pale, Hamlet-like face. Dear God, the\nzed-ray light lay gray and penetrating upon it!\n\nMiko took another step. Peering. Grinning. \"How amazing, George\nPrince! Why, I can hardly believe it!\"\n\nMoa was armed with an electronic cylinder now. For all her\namazement--what turgid emotions sweeping her I can only guess--she\nnever took her eyes from Snap and me.\n\n\"Back! Don't move either of you!\" she hissed at us.\n\nThen Miko leaped at Anita like a giant gray leopard pouncing.\n\n\"Away with that cloak, Prince!\"\n\nI stood cold and numbed. And realization came at last. The faint\nzed-light had fallen by chance upon Anita's face. Penetrating the\nflesh; exposed, faintly glowing, the bone line of her jaw. Unmasked\nthe art of Glutz.\n\nMiko seized her wrists, drew her forward, beyond the shaft of\nzed-light, into the brilliant light of the Moon. And ripped her cloak\nfrom her. The gentle curves of her woman's figure were so\nunmistakable!\n\nAnd as Miko gazed at them, all his calm triumph swept away.\n\n\"Why, Anita!\"\n\nI heard Moa mutter, \"So that is it?\" A venomous flashing look--a shaft\nfrom me to Anita and back again. \"So that is it?\"\n\n\"Why, Anita!\"\n\nMiko's great arms gathered her up as though she were a child. \"So I\nhave you back! From the dead, delivered back to me!\"\n\n\"Gregg!\" Snap's warning, and his grip on my shoulders brought me a\nmeasure of sanity. I had tensed to spring. I stood quivering, and Moa\nthrust her weapon against my face. The grids were swaying again with a\nmessage from Grantline. But it was ignored.\n\nIn the glare of moonlight by the forward window, Miko held Anita, his\ngreat hands pawing her with triumphant possessive caresses.\n\n\"So, little Anita, you are given back to me!\"\n\n\n\n\nXX\n\n\nMoonlight upon Earth so gently shines to make romantic a lover's\nsmile! But the reality of the Lunar night is cold beyond human belief.\nCold and darkly silent. Grim desolation. Awesome. Majestic. A frowning\nmajesty that even to the most intrepid human beholder is inconceivably\nforbidding.\n\nAnd there were humans here now. On this tumbled plain, between\nArchimedes and the mountains, one small crater amid the million of its\nfellows was distinguished this night by the presence of humans. The\nGrantline camp! It huddled in the deepest purple shadows on the side\nof a bowl-like pit, a crudely circular orifice with a scant two miles\nacross its rippling rim. There was faint light here to mark the\npresence of the living intruders. The blue glow radiance of Morrell\ntube lights under a spread of glassite.\n\nThe Grantline camp stood midway up one of the inner cliff walls of the\nlittle crater. The broken, rock-strewn floor, two miles wide, lay five\nhundred feet below the camp. Behind it, the jagged, precipitous cliff\nrose another five hundred to the heights of the upper rim. A broad\nlevel shelf hung midway up the cliff, and upon it Grantline had built\nhis little group of glassite dome shelters. Viewed from above there\nwas the darkly purple crater floor, the upflung circular rim where the\nEarthlight tinged the spires and crags with yellow sheen; and on the\nshelf, like a huddled group of birds' nests, Grantline's domes hung\nand gazed down upon the inner valley.\n\nThe air here on the Moon surface was negligible--a scant one\nfive-thousandth of the atmospheric pressure at the sea level on Earth.\nBut within the glassite shelter, a normal Earth pressure must be\nmaintained. Rigidly braced double walls to withstand the explosive\ntendency, with no external pressure to counteract it. A tremendous\nnecessity for mechanical equipment had burdened Grantline's small ship\nto capacity. The chemistry of manufactured air, the pressure\nequalizers, renewers, respirators, the lighting and temperature\nmaintenance of a space-flyer was here.\n\nThere was this main Grantline building, stretched low and rectangular\nalong the front edge of the ledge. Within it were living rooms, mess\nhall and kitchen. Fifty feet behind it, connected by a narrow passage\nof glassite, was a similar though smaller structure. The mechanical\ncontrol rooms, with their humming, vibrating mechanisms were here. And\nan instrument room with signaling apparatus, senders, receivers,\nmirror-grids and audiphones of several varieties. And an\nelectro-telescope, small but modern, with dome overhead like a little\nEarth observatory.\n\nFrom this instrument building, beside the connecting pedestrian\npassage, wire cables for light, and air tubes and strings and bundles\nof instrument wires ran to the main structure--gray snakes upon the\nporous, gray Lunar rock.\n\nThe third building seemed a lean-to banked against the cliff wall, a\nslanting shed-wall of glassite fifty feet high and two hundred in\nlength. Under it, for months Grantline's bores had dug into the cliff.\nBraced tunnels were here, penetrating back and downward into the vein\nof rock.\n\nThe work was over. The borers had been dismantled and packed away. At\none end of the cliff the mining equipment lay piled in a litter. There\nwas a heap of discarded ore where Grantline had carted and dumped it\nafter his first crude refining process had yielded it as waste. The\nore slag lay like gray powder flakes strewn down the cliff. Trucks and\nore carts along the ledge stood discarded, mute evidence of the weeks\nand months of work these helmeted miners had undergone, struggling\nupon this airless, frowning world.\n\nBut now all that was finished. The catalytic ore was sufficiently\nconcentrated. It lay--this treasure--in a seventy foot pile behind\nthe glassite lean-to, with a cage of wires over it and an insulation\nbarrage hiding its presence.\n\nThe ore shelter was dark; the other two buildings were lighted. And\nthere were small lights mounted at intervals about the camp and along\nthe edge of the ledge. A spider ladder, with tiny platforms some\ntwenty feet one above the other, hung precariously to the cliff-face.\nIt descended the five hundred feet to the crater floor; and, behind\nthe camp, it mounted the jagged cliff-face to the upper rim height,\nwhere a small observatory platform was placed.\n\nSuch was the outer aspect of the Grantline Treasure Camp near the\nbeginning of this Lunar night, when, unknown to Grantline and his men,\nthe _Planetara_ with its brigands was approaching. The night was\nperhaps a sixth advanced. Full night. No breath of cloud to mar the\nbrilliant starry heavens. The quadrant Earth hung poised like a giant\nmellow moon over Grantline's crater. A bright Earth, yet no air was\nhere on this Lunar surface to spread its light. Only a glow, mingling\nwith the spots of blue tube light on the poles along the cliff, and\nthe radiance from the lighted buildings.\n\nNo evidence of movement showed about the silent camp. Then a pressure\ndoor in an end of the main building opened its tiny series of locks. A\nbent figure came out. The lock closed. The figure straightened and\ngazed about the camp. Grotesque, bloated semblance of a man! Helmeted,\nwith rounded dome hood, suggestion of an ancient sea diver, yet\ngoggled and trunked like a gas-masked fighter of the twentieth\ncentury.\n\nHe stopped presently and disconnected metal weights which were upon\nhis shoes.\n\nThen he stood erect again, and with giant strides bounded along the\ncliff. Fantastic figure in the blue lit gloom! A child's dream of\ncrags and rocks and strange lights with a single monstrous figure in\nseven league boots.\n\nHe went the length of the ledge with his twenty foot strides,\ninspected the lights, and made adjustments. Came back, and climbed\nwith agile, bounding leaps up the spider ladder to the dome of the\ncrater top. A light flashed on up there. Then it was extinguished.\n\nThe goggled, bloated figure came leaping down after a moment.\nGrantline's exterior watchman making his rounds. He came back to the\nmain building. Fastened the weights on his shoes. Signaled.\n\nThe lock opened. The figure went inside.\n\nIt was early evening. After the dinner hour and before the time of\nsleep according to the camp routine Grantline was maintaining. Nine\nP.M. of Earth Eastern American time, recorded now upon his Earth\nchronometer. In the living room of the main building Johnny Grantline\nsat with a dozen of his men dispersed about the room, whiling away as\nbest they could the lonesome hours.\n\n\"All as usual. This cursed Moon! When I get home--if I ever do--\"\n\n\"Say your say, Wilks. But you'll spend your share of the gold leaf and\nthank your constellations that you had your chance to make it.\"\n\n\"Let him alone! Come on, Wilks, take a hand here. This game is not any\ngood with three.\"\n\nThe man who had been outside flung his hissing helmet recklessly to\nthe floor and unsealed his suit. \"Here, get me out of this. No, I\nwon't play. I can't play your cursed game with nothing at stake!\"\n\nA laugh went up at the sharp look Johnny Grantline flung from where he\nsat reading in a corner of the room.\n\n\"Commander's orders. No gambling gold leafers tolerated here.\"\n\n\"Play the game, Wilks,\" Grantline said quietly. \"We all know it's\ninfernal--this doing nothing.\"\n\n\"He's been struck by Earthlight,\" another man laughed. \"Commander, I\ntold you not to let that guy Wilks out at night.\"\n\nA rough but good-natured lot of men. Jolly and raucous by nature in\ntheir leisure hours. But there was too much leisure here now. Their\nmirth had a hollow sound. In older times, explorers of the frozen\nPolar zones had to cope with inactivity, loneliness and despair. But\nat least they were on their native world. The grimness of the Moon was\neating into the courage of Grantline's men. An unreality here. A\nweirdness. These fantastic crags. The deadly silence. The nights,\nalmost two weeks of Earth time in length, congealed by the deadly\nfrigidity of space. The days of black sky, blazing stars and flaming\nSun, with no atmosphere to diffuse the Sun's heat radiating so swiftly\nfrom the naked Lunar surface that the outer temperature still was\ncold. And day and night, always the beloved Earth disc hanging poised\nup near the zenith. From thinnest crescent to full Earth, then back to\ncrescent.\n\nAll so abnormal, irrational, disturbing to human senses.\n\nWith the mining work over, an irritability grew upon Grantline's men.\nAnd perhaps since the human mind is so wonderful, elusive a thing,\nthere lay upon these men an indefinable sense of disaster. Johnny\nGrantline felt it. He thought about it now as he sat in the room\ncorner watching Wilks being forced into the plaget game, and he found\nthe premonition strong within him. Unreasonably, ominous depression!\nBarring the accident which had disabled his little spaceship when they\nreached this small crater hole, his expedition had gone well. His\ninstruments, and the information he had from the former explorers, had\nenabled him to pick up the catalyst vein with only one month of\nsearch.\n\nThe vein had now been exhausted; but the treasure was here--enough to\nsupply every need on his Earth! Nothing was left but to wait for the\n_Planetara_. The men were talking of that now.\n\n\"She ought to be well midway from Ferrok-Shahn by now. When do you\nfigure she'll be back here and signal us?\"\n\n\"Twenty days. Give her another five now to Mars, and five in port.\nThat's ten. We'll pick her signals in three weeks, mark me!\"\n\n\"Three weeks. Just give me three weeks of reasonable sunrise and\nsunset! This cursed Moon! You mean, Williams, next daylight.\"\n\n\"Ha! He's inventing a Lunar language. You'll be a Moon man yet.\"\n\nOlaf Swenson, the big blond fellow from the Scandia fiords, came and\nflung himself down beside Grantline.\n\n\"Ay tank they bane without enough to do, Commander ----\"\n\n\"Three weeks isn't very long, Ole.\"\n\n\"No. Maybe not.\"\n\nFrom across the room somebody was saying, \"If the _Comet_ hadn't\nsmashed on us, damn me but I'd ask the Commander to let some of us\ntake her back.\"\n\n\"Shut up, Billy. She _is_ smashed.\"\n\n\"You all agreed to things as they are,\" Johnny said shortly. \"We all\ntook the same chances--voluntarily.\"\n\nA dynamic little fellow, this Johnny Grantline. Short of temper\nsometimes, but always just, and a perfect leader of men. In stature he\nwas almost as small as Snap. But he was thick-set, with a\nsmooth-shaven, keen-eyed, square-jawed face; and a shock of brown\ntousled hair. A man of thirty-five, though the decision of his manner,\nthe quiet dominance of his voice made him seem older. He stood up now,\nsurveying the blue lit glassite room with its low ceiling close\noverhead. He was bow-legged; in movement he seemed to roll with a\nstiff-legged gait like some sea captains of former days on the deck of\nhis swaying ship. Odd looking figure! Heavy flannel shirt and\ntrousers, boots heavily weighted, and bulky metal-loaded belt strapped\nabout his waist.\n\nHe grinned at Swenson. \"When the time comes to divide this treasure,\neveryone will be happy, Ole.\"\n\nThe treasure was estimated to be the equivalent of ninety millions in\ngold leaf. A hundred and ten millions in the gross as it now stood,\nwith twenty millions to be deducted by the Federated Refiners for\nreducing it to the standard purity for commercial use. Ninety\nmillions, with only a million and a half to come off for expedition\nexpenses, and the _Planetara's_ share another million. A nice little\nstake.\n\nGrantline strode across the room with his rolling gait.\n\n\"Cheer up, boys. Who's winning there? I say, you fellows--\"\n\nAn audiphone buzzer interrupted him, a call from the duty man in the\ninstrument room of the nearby building.\n\nGrantline clicked the receiver. The room fell into silence. Any call\nwas unusual--nothing ever happened here in the camp.\n\nThe duty man's voice sounded over the room.\n\n\"Signals coming! Not clear. Will you come over, Commander?\"\n\nSignals!\n\nIt was never Grantline's way to enforce needless discipline. He\noffered no objection when every man in the camp rushed through the\nconnecting passages. They crowded the instrument room where the tense\nduty man sat bending over his radio receivers. The mirrors were\nswaying.\n\nThe duty man looked up and met Grantline's gaze.\n\n\"I ran it up to the highest intensity, Commander. We ought to get\nit--\"\n\n\"Low scale, Peter?\"\n\n\"Yes. Weakest infra-red. I'm bringing it up, even though it uses too\nmuch of our power.\"\n\n\"Get it,\" said Grantline shortly.\n\n\"I got one slight television swing a minute ago--then it faded. I\nthink it's the _Planetara_.\"\n\n\"_Planetara_!\" The crowding group of men chorused. How could it be the\n_Planetara_?\n\nBut it was. The call came in presently. Unmistakably the _Planetara_,\nturned back now from her course to Ferrok-Shahn.\n\n\"How far away, Peter?\"\n\nThe duty man consulted the needles of his dial scale. \"Close! Very\nweak infra-red. But close. Around thirty thousand miles, maybe. It's\nSnap Dean calling.\"\n\nThe _Planetara_ here within thirty thousand miles! Excitement and\npleasure swept the room. The _Planetara_ had for so long been awaited\neagerly!\n\nThe excitement communicated to Grantline. It was unlike him to be\nincautious; yet now with no thought save that some unforeseen and\npleasing circumstance had brought the _Planetara_ ahead of time;\nincautious, Grantline certainly was!\n\n\"Raise the barrage.\"\n\n\"I'll go. My suit is here.\"\n\nA willing volunteer rushed out to the shed.\n\n\"Can you send, Peter?\" Grantline demanded.\n\n\"Yes. With more power.\"\n\n\"Use it.\"\n\nJohnny dictated the message of his location which we received. In his\nincautious excitement he ignored the secret code.\n\nAn interval passed. No message had come from us--just Snap's routine\nsignal in the weak infra-red, which we hoped Grantline would not get.\n\nThe men crowding Grantline's instrument room waited in tense silence.\nThen Grantline tried the television again. Its current weakened the\nlights with the drain upon the distributors, and cooled the room with\na sudden deadly chill as the Erentz insulating system slowed down.\n\nThe duty man looked frightened. \"You'll bulge out our walls,\nCommander. The internal pressure--\"\n\n\"We'll chance it.\"\n\nThey picked up the image of the _Planetara_. It shone clear on the\ngrid--the segment of star-field with a tiny cigar-shaped blob. Clear\nenough to be unmistakable. The _Planetara_! Here now, over the Moon,\nalmost directly overhead, poised at what the altimeter scale showed to\nbe a fraction under thirty thousand miles.\n\nThe men gazed in awed silence. The _Planetara_ coming....\n\nBut the altimeter needle was motionless. The _Planetara_ was hanging\npoised.\n\nA sudden gasp went about the room. The men stood with whitening faces,\ngazing at the _Planetara's_ image. And at the altimeter's needle. It\nwas moving now. The _Planetara_ was descending. But not with an\norderly swoop.\n\nThe grid showed the ship clearly. The bow tilted up, then dipped down.\nBut then in a moment it swung up again. The ship turned partly over.\nRighted itself. Then swayed again, drunkenly.\n\nThe watching men were stricken in horrified silence. The _Planetara's_\nimage momentarily, horribly, grew larger. Swaying. Then turning\ncompletely over, rotating slowly end over end.\n\nThe _Planetara_, out of control, was falling!\n\n\n\n\nXXI\n\n\nOn the _Planetara_, in the radio room, Snap and I stood with Moa's\nweapon upon us. Miko held Anita. Triumphant, possessive. Then as she\nstruggled, a gentleness came to this strange Martian giant. Perhaps he\nreally loved her. Looking back on it, I sometimes think so.\n\n\"Anita, do not fear me.\" He held her away from him. \"I would not harm\nyou. I want your love.\" Irony came to him. \"And I thought I had killed\nyou. But it was only your brother.\"\n\nHe partly turned. I was aware of how alert was his attention. He\ngrinned. \"Hold them, Moa. Don't let them do anything foolish.... So,\nlittle Anita, you were masquerading to spy on me? That was wrong of\nyou.\"\n\nAnita had not spoken. She held herself tensely away from Miko. She had\nflashed me a look, just one. What horrible mischance to have brought\non this catastrophe!\n\nThe completion of Grantline's message had come unnoticed by us all. We\nremained tense.\n\n\"Look! Grantline again!\" Snap said abruptly.\n\nBut the mirrors were steadying. We had no recording mechanism; the\nrest of the message was lost.\n\nNo further message came. There was an interval while Miko waited. He\nheld Anita in the hollow of his great arm.\n\n\"Quiet, little bird. Do not fear me. I have work to do, Anita, this is\nour great adventure. We will be rich, you and I. All the luxuries\nthese worlds can offer--all for us when this is over. Careful, Moa!\nThis Haljan has no wit.\"\n\nWell could he say it. I, who had been so witless as to let this come\nupon us! Moa's weapon prodded me. Her voice hissed at me with all the\nvenom of a reptile enraged. \"So that was your game, Gregg Haljan! And\nI was so graceless as to admit love for you!\"\n\nSnap murmured in my ear, \"Don't move, Gregg! She's reckless.\"\n\nShe heard it. She whirled on him. \"We have lost George Prince, it\nseems. Well, we will survive without his scientific knowledge. And\nyou, Dean--and this Haljan, mark me--I will kill you both if you cause\ntrouble!\"\n\nMiko was gloating. \"Don't kill them yet, Moa. What was it Grantline\nsaid? Near the crater of Archimedes. Ring us down, Haljan. We'll\nland.\"\n\nHe signaled the turret, gave Coniston the Grantline message, and\naudiphoned it below to Hahn. The news spread about the ship. The\nbandits were jubilant.\n\n\"We'll land now, Haljan. Come, Anita and I will go with you to the\nturret.\"\n\nI found my voice. \"To what destination?\"\n\n\"Near Archimedes. The Apennine side. Keep well away from the Grantline\ncamp. We will probably sight it as we descend.\"\n\nThere was no trajectory needed. We were almost over Archimedes now. I\ncould drop us with a visible, instrumental course. My mind was\nwhirling with a confusion of thoughts. What could we do? I met Snap's\ngaze.\n\n\"Ring us down, Gregg,\" he said quietly.\n\nI nodded. I pushed Moa's weapon away. \"You don't need that--\"\n\nWe went to the turret. Moa watched me and Snap, a grim, cold Amazon.\nShe avoided looking at Anita, whom Miko helped down the ladders with\na strange mixture of courtierlike grace and amused irony. Coniston\nstared at Anita.\n\n\"I say, not George Prince? The girl--\"\n\n\"No time for explanations,\" Miko commanded. \"It's the girl,\nmasquerading as her brother. Get below, Coniston. Haljan takes us\ndown.\"\n\nThe astounded Englishman continued to gaze at Anita. But he said, \"I\nmean to say, where to on the Moon? Not to encounter Grantline at once,\nMiko? Our equipment is not ready.\"\n\n\"Of course not. We will land well away--\"\n\nThe reluctant Coniston left us. I took the controls. Miko, still\nholding Anita as though she were a child, sat beside me. \"We will\nwatch him, Anita. A skilled fellow at this sort of work.\"\n\nI rang my signals for the shifting of the gravity plates. The answer\nshould have come from below within a second or two. But it did not.\nMiko regarded me with his great bushy eyebrows upraised.\n\n\"Ring again, Haljan.\"\n\nI duplicated. No answer. The silence was ominous.\n\nMiko muttered, \"That accursed Hahn. Ring again!\"\n\nI sent the imperative emergency demand.\n\nNo answer. A second or two. Then all of us in the turret were\nstartled. Transfixed. From below came a sudden hiss. It sounded in the\nturret; it came from the shifting room call grid. The hissing of the\npneumatic valves of the plate shifters in the lower control room. The\nvalves were opening; the plates automatically shifting into neutral,\nand disconnecting!\n\nAn instant of startled silence. Miko may have realized the\nsignificance of what had happened. Certainly Snap and I did. The\nhissing ceased. I gripped the emergency plate shifter switch which\nhung over my head. Its disc was dead! The plates were dead in neutral:\nin the position they were placed only in port! And their shifting\nmechanisms were imperative!\n\nI was on my feet. \"We're in neutral!\"\n\nThe Moon disc moved visibly as the _Planetara_ lurched. The vault of\nthe heavens was slowly swinging.\n\nMiko ripped out a heavy oath. \"Haljan! What is this?\"\n\nThe heavens turned with a giant swoop. The Moon was over us. It swung\nin a dizzying arc. Overhead, then back past our stern; under us, then\nappearing over our bow.\n\nThe _Planetara_ had turned over. Upending. Rotating, end over end.\n\nFor a moment I think all of us in the turret stood and clung. The Moon\ndisc, the Earth, Sun and all the stars were swinging past our windows.\nSo horribly dizzying. The _Planetara_ seemed lurching and tumbling.\nBut it was an optical effect only. I stared with grim determination at\nmy feet. The turret seemed to steady.\n\nThen I looked again. That horrible swoop of all the heavens! And the\nMoon, as it went past seemed expanded. We were falling! Out of\ncontrol, with the Moon gravity pulling us down!\n\n\"That accursed Hahn--\"\n\nA moment only had passed. My fancy that the Moon disc was enlarged was\nmerely the horror of my imagination. We had not fallen far enough for\nthat.\n\nBut we were falling. Unless I could do something, we would crash upon\nthe Lunar surface.\n\nAnita, killed in this turret: the end of everything--every hope.\n\nAction came to me. I gasped, \"Miko, you stay here! The controls are\ndead! You stay here and hold Anita--\"\n\nI ignored Moa's weapon. Snap thrust her away.\n\n\"We're falling, you fool--let us alone!\"\n\nMiko gasped, \"Can you--check us? What happened?\"\n\n\"I don't know--\"\n\nI stood clinging. This dizzying whirl. From the audiphone grid\nConiston's voice sounded.\n\n\"I say, Haljan, something's wrong. Hahn doesn't signal.\"\n\nThe lookout in the forward tower was clinging to our window. On the\ndeck below our turret a member of the crew appeared, stood lurching\nfor a moment, then shouted and ran, swaying, aimless. From the lower\nhull corridors our grids sounded with the tramping of running steps.\nPanic among the crew was spreading over the ship. A chaos below deck.\n\nI pulled at the emergency switch again. Dead....\n\n\"Snap, we must get down. The signals.\"\n\nConiston's voice came like a scream from the grid. \"Hahn is dead. The\ncontrols are broken!\"\n\nI shouted, \"Miko, hold Anita! Come on, Snap!\"\n\nWe clung to the ladders. Snap was behind me. \"Careful, Gregg! Good\nGod!\"\n\nThis dizzying whirl. I tried not to look. The deck under me was now a\nblurred kaleidoscope of swinging patches of moonlight and shadow.\n\nWe reached the deck. It seemed that from the turret Anita's voice\nfollowed us. \"Be careful!\"\n\nOnce inside the ship, our senses steadied. With the rotating, reeling\nheavens shut out, there were only the shouts and tramping steps of the\npanic-stricken crew to mark that there was anything amiss. That, and a\npseudo sensation of lurching caused by the pulsing of gravity--a pull\nwhen the Moon was beneath our hull to combine its forces with our\nmagnetizers; a lightening, when it was overhead. A throbbing, pendulum\nlurch!\n\nWe ran down to the corridor incline. A white-faced member of the crew\ncame running up.\n\n\"What's happened, Haljan? What's happened?\"\n\n\"We're falling!\" I gripped him. \"Get below. Come with us.\"\n\nBut he jerked away from me. \"Falling?\"\n\nA steward came running. \"Falling? My God!\"\n\nSnap swung at them. \"Get ahead of us! The manual controls--our only\nchance--we need all you men at the compressor pumps!\"\n\nBut it was instinct to try and get on deck, as though here below we\nwere rats caught in a trap. The men tore away from us and ran. Their\nshouts of panic resounded through the dim, blue lit corridors.\n\nConiston came lurching from the control room. \"I say--falling! Haljan,\nmy God, look!\"\n\nHahn was sprawled at the gravity plate switchboard. Sprawled, head\ndown. Dead. Killed? Or a suicide?\n\nI bent over him. His hands gripped the main switch. He had ripped it\nloose. And his left hand had reached and broken the fragile line of\ntubes that intensified the current of the pneumatic plate-shifters. A\nsuicide? With his last frenzy, determined to kill us all? Why?\n\nThen I saw that Hahn had been killed! Not a suicide! In his hand he\ngripped a small segment of black fabric, a piece torn from an\ninvisible cloak!\n\nSnap was rigging the hand compressors. If he could get the pressure\nback in the tanks....\n\nI swung on Coniston. \"You armed?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" He was white-faced and confused, but not in a panic. He showed\nme his heat ray cylinder. \"What do you want me to do?\"\n\n\"Round up the crew. Get all you can. Bring them here to man the\npumps.\"\n\nHe dashed away. Snap called after him, \"Kill them if they argue!\"\n\nMiko's voice sounded from the turret call grid: \"Falling! Haljan, you\ncan see it now! Check us!\"\n\nDesperate moments. Or was it an hour? Coniston brought the men. He\nstood over them with menacing weapon.\n\nWe had all the pumps going. The pressure rose a little in the tanks.\nEnough to shift a bow plate. I tried it. The plate slowly clicked into\na new combination. A gravity repulsion just in the bow-tip.\n\nI signaled Miko. \"Have we stopped swinging?\"\n\n\"No. But slower.\"\n\nI could feel it, that lurch of the gravity. But not steady now. A\nlimp. The tendency of our bow was to stay up.\n\n\"More pressure, Snap.\"\n\nOne of the crew rebelled, tried to bolt from the room.\n\nConiston shot him down.\n\nI shifted another bow plate. Then two in the stern. The stern plates\nseemed to move more readily than the others.\n\n\"Run all the stern plates,\" Snap advised.\n\nI tried it. The lurching stopped. Miko called, \"We're bow down.\nFalling!\"\n\nBut not falling free. The Moon gravity pull on us was more than half\nneutralized.\n\n\"I'll go up, Snap, and try the engines. You don't mind staying down\nhere? Executing my signals?\"\n\n\"You idiot!\" He gripped my shoulders. His eyes were gleaming, his face\nhaggard, but his pale lips twitched with a smile.\n\n\"Maybe it's good-bye, Gregg. We'll fall--fighting.\"\n\n\"Yes. Fighting. Coniston, you keep the pressure up.\"\n\nWith the broken tubes it took nearly all the pressure to maintain the\nfew plates I had shifted. One slipped back to neutral. Then the pumps\ngained on it, and it shifted again.\n\nI dashed up to the deck. Oh, the Moon was so close now! So horribly\nclose! The deck shadows were still. Through the forward bow windows\nthe Moon surface glared up at us.\n\nThose last horrible minutes were a blur. And there was always Anita's\nface. She left Miko. Faced with death, he sat clinging. Moa too, sat\napart--staring.\n\nAnd Anita crept to me. \"Gregg, dear one. The end....\"\n\nI tried the electronic engines from the stern, setting them in\nreverse. The streams of their light glowed from the stern, forward\nalong our hull, and flared down from our bow toward the Lunar surface.\nBut no atmosphere was here to give resistance. Perhaps the electronic\nstreams checked our fall a little. The pumps gave us pressure just in\nthe last minutes, to slide a few of the hull plates. But our bow\nstayed down. We slid, like a spent rocket falling.\n\nI recall the horror of that expanding Lunar surface. The maw of\nArchimedes yawning. A blob. Widening to a great pit. Then I saw it was\nto one side, rushing upward.\n\n\"Gregg, dear one--good-bye.\"\n\nHer gentle arms about me. The end of everything for us. I recall\nmurmuring, \"Not falling free, Anita. Some hull plates are set.\"\n\nMy dials showed another plate shifting, checking us a little further.\nGood old Snap!\n\nI calculated the next best plate to shift. I tried it. Slid it over.\n\nThen everything faded but the feeling of Anita's arms around me.\n\n\"Gregg, dear one--\"\n\nThe end of everything for us....\n\nThere was an up-rush of gray-black rock.\n\n\n\n\nXXII\n\n\nI opened my eyes to a dark blur of confusion. My shoulder hurt--a pain\nshooting through it. Something lay like a weight on me. I could not\nseem to move my left arm. Then I moved it and it hurt. I was lying\ntwisted. I sat up. And with a rush, memory came. The crash was over. I\nwas not dead. Anita--\n\nShe was lying beside me. There was a little light here in the silent\nblur--a soft mellow Earthlight filtering in the window. The weight on\nme was Anita. She lay sprawled, her head and shoulders half way across\nmy lap.\n\nNot dead! Thank God, not dead! She moved. Her arms went around me, and\nI lifted her. The Earthlight glowed on her pale face.\n\n\"It's past, Anita! We've struck, and we're still alive.\"\n\nI held her as though all of life's turgid dangers were powerless to\ntouch us.\n\nBut in the silence my floating senses were brought back to reality by\na faint sound forcing itself upon me. A little hiss. The faintest\nmurmuring breath like a hiss. Escaping air!\n\nI cast off Anita's clinging arms. \"Anita, this is madness!\"\n\nFor minutes we must have been lying there in the heaven of our\nembrace. But air was escaping! The _Planetara's_ dome was broken and\nour precious air was hissing out.\n\nFull reality came to me. I was not seriously injured. I found I could\nmove freely. I could stand. A twisted shoulder, a limp left arm, but\nthey were better in a moment.\n\nAnd Anita did not seem to be hurt. Blood was upon her. But not her\nown.\n\nBeside Anita, stretched face down on the turret grid, was the giant\nfigure of Miko. The blood lay in a small pool against his face. A\nwidening pool.\n\nMoa was here. I thought her body twitched; then was still. This\nsoundless wreckage! In the dim glow of the wrecked turret with its two\nmotionless, broken human figures, it seemed as though Anita and I were\nghouls prowling. I saw that the turret had fallen over to the\n_Planetara's_ deck. It lay dashed against the dome side.\n\nThe deck was aslant. A litter of wreckage! A broken human figure\nshowed--one of the crew who, at the last, must have come running up.\nThe forward observation tower was down on the chart room roof: in its\nmetal tangle I thought I could see the legs of the tower lookout.\n\nSo this was the end of the brigands' adventure. The _Planetara's_ last\nvoyage! How small and futile are humans' struggles. Miko's daring\nenterprise--so villainous--brought all in a few moments to this silent\ntragedy. The _Planetara_ had fallen thirty thousand miles. But why?\nWhat had happened to Hahn? And where was Coniston, down in this broken\nhull?\n\nAnd Snap! I thought suddenly of Snap.\n\nI clutched at my wandering wits. This inactivity was death. The\nescaping air hissed in my ears. Our precious air, escaping away into\nthe vacant desolation of the Lunar emptiness. Through one of the\ntwisted, slanting dome windows a rocky spire was visible. The\n_Planetara_ lay bow down, wedged in a jagged cradle of Lunar rock. A\nmiracle that the hull and dome had held together.\n\n\"Anita, we must get out of here!\"\n\n\"Their helmets are in the forward storage room, Gregg.\"\n\nShe was staring at the fallen Miko and Moa. She shuddered and turned\naway and gripped me. \"In the forward storage room, by the port of the\nemergency exit.\"\n\nIf only the exit locks would operate! We must find Snap and get out of\nhere. Good old Snap! Would we find him lying dead?\n\nWe climbed from the slanting, fallen turret, over the wreckage of the\nlittered deck. It was not difficult. A lightness was upon us. The\n_Planetara's_ gravity-magnetizers were dead; this was only the light\nMoon gravity pulling us.\n\n\"Careful, Anita. Don't jump too freely.\"\n\nWe leaped along the deck. The hiss of the escaping pressure was like a\nclanging gong of warning to tell us to hurry. The hiss of death so\nclose!\n\n\"Snap--\" I murmured.\n\n\"Oh, Gregg, I pray we may find him alive!\"\n\nWith a fifteen foot leap we cleared a pile of broken deck chairs. A\nman lay groaning near them. I went back with a rush. Not Snap! A\nsteward. He had been a brigand, but he was a steward to me now.\n\n\"Get up! This is Haljan. Hurry, we must get out of here The air is\nescaping!\"\n\nBut he sank back and lay still. No time to find if I could help him:\nthere was Anita and Snap to save.\n\nWe found a broken entrance to one of the descending passages. I flung\nthe debris aside and cleared it. Like a giant of strength with only\nthis Moon gravity holding me, I raised a broken segment of\nsuperstructure and heaved it back.\n\nAnita and I dropped ourselves down the sloping passage. The interior\nof the wrecked ship was silent and dim. An occasional passage light\nwas still burning. The passage and all the rooms lay askew. Wreckage\neverywhere but the double dome and hull shell had withstood the shock.\nThen I realized that the Erentz system was slowing down. Our heat,\nlike our air, was escaping, radiating away, a deadly chill settling on\neverything. The silence and the deadly chill of death would soon be\nhere in these wrecked corridors. The end of the _Planetara_.\n\nWe prowled like ghouls. We did not see Coniston. Snap had been by the\nshifter pumps. We found him in the oval doorway. He lay sprawled.\nDead? No, he moved. He sat up before we could get to him. He seemed\nconfused, but his senses clarified with the movement of our figures\nover him.\n\n\"Gregg! Why, Anita!\"\n\n\"Snap! You're all right? We struck--the air is escaping.\"\n\nHe pushed me away. He tried to stand. \"I'm all right. I was up a\nminute ago. Gregg, it's getting cold. Where is she? I had her\nhere--she wasn't killed. I spoke to her.\"\n\nIrrational!\n\n\"Snap!\" I held him. Shook him. \"Snap, old fellow!\"\n\nHe said normally, \"Easy, Gregg. I'm all right.\"\n\nAnita gripped him. \"Who, Snap?\"\n\n\"She--there she is....\"\n\nAnother figure was here! On the grid floor by the door oval. A figure\npartly shrouded in a broken invisible cloak and hook. An invisible\ncloak! I saw a white face with opened eyes regarding me.\n\n\"Venza!\" I bent down. \"You!\"\n\nVenza here? Why ... how ... my thoughts swept on. Venza here--dying?\nHer eyes closed. But she murmured to Anita, \"Where is he? I want him.\"\n\nI murmured impulsively, \"Here I am, Venza dear.\" Gently, as one would\nspeak with gentle sympathy to humor the dying. \"Here I am, Venza.\"\n\nBut it was only the confusion of the shock upon her. And it was upon\nus all. She pushed at Anita. \"I want him.\" She saw me; this whimsical\nVenus girl! Even here as we gathered, all of us blurred by shock,\nconfused in the dim, wrecked ship with the chill of death coming--even\nhere she could jest. Her pale lips smiled.\n\n\"You, Gregg. I'm not hurt--I don't think I'm hurt.\" She managed to get\nherself up on one elbow. \"Did you think I wanted you with my dying\nbreath? What conceit! Not you, Handsome Haljan! I was calling Snap.\"\n\nHe was down to her. \"We're all right, Venza. It's over. We must get\nout of the ship. The air is escaping.\"\n\nWe gathered in the oval doorway. We fought the confusion of panic.\n\n\"The exit port is this way.\"\n\nOr was it? I answered Snap, \"Yes, I think so.\"\n\nThe ship suddenly seemed a stranger to me. So cold. So vibrationless.\nBroken lights. These slanting wrecked corridors. With the ventilating\nfans stilled, the air was turning fetid. Chilling. And thinning, with\nescaping pressure, rarefying so that I could feel the grasp of it in\nmy lungs and the pin-pricks in my cheeks.\n\nWe started off. Four of us, still alive in this silent ship of death.\nMy blurred thoughts tried to cope with it all. Venza here. I\nremembered how she had bade me create a diversion when the women\npassengers were landing on the asteroid. She had carried out her\npurpose! In the confusion she had not gone ashore. A stowaway here.\nShe had secured the cloak. Prowling, to try and help us, she had come\nupon Hahn. Had seized his ray cylinder and struck him down, and been\nherself knocked unconscious by his dying lunge, which also had broken\nthe tubes and wrecked the _Planetara_. And Venza, unconscious, had\nbeen lying here with the mechanism of her cloak still operating, so\nthat we did not see her when we came and found why Hahn did not answer\nmy signals.\n\n\"It's here, Gregg.\"\n\nSnap and I lifted the pile of Moon equipment to which she referred.\nWe located four suits and helmets and the mechanisms to operate them.\n\n\"More are in the chart room,\" Anita said.\n\nBut we needed no others. I robed Anita and showed her the mechanisms.\nSnap was helping Venza. We were all stiff from the cold; but within\nthe suits and their pulsing currents, the blessed warmth came again.\n\nThe helmets had ports through which food and drink could be taken. I\nstood with my helmet ready. Anita, Venza and Snap were bloated and\ngrotesque beside me. We had found food and water here, assembled in\nportable cases which the brigands had prepared. Snap lifted them, and\nsignaled to me he was ready.\n\nMy helmet shut out all sounds save my own breathing, my pounding\nheart, and the murmur of the mechanism. The warmth and pure air were\ngood.\n\nWe reached the hull port locks. They operated! We went through in the\nlight of the headlamps over our foreheads.\n\nI closed the locks after us: an instinct to keep the air in the ship\nfor the other trapped humans lying in there.\n\nWe slid down the sloping side of the _Planetara_. We were unweighted,\nirrationally agile with this slight gravity. I fell a dozen feet and\nlanded with barely a jar.\n\nWe were out on the Lunar surface. A great sloping ramp of crags\nstretched down before us. Gray-black rock tinged with Earthlight. The\nEarth hung amid the stars in the blackness overhead like a huge\nsection of a glowing yellow ball.\n\nThis grim, desolate, silent landscape! Beyond the ramp, fifty feet\nbelow us, a tumbled naked plain stretched away into blurred distance.\nBut I could see mountains off there. Behind us, the towering, frowning\nrampart-wall of Archimedes loomed against the sky.\n\nI had turned to look back at the _Planetara_. She lay broken, wedged\nbetween spires of upstanding rock. A few of her lights still gleamed.\nThe end of the _Planetara_!\n\nThe three grotesque figures of Anita, Venza and Snap had started off.\nHunchback figures with the tanks mounted on their shoulders. I bounded\nand caught them. I touched Snap. We made audiphone contact.\n\n\"Which way do you think?\" I demanded.\n\n\"I think this way, down the ramp. Away from Archimedes, toward the\nmountains. It shouldn't be too far.\"\n\n\"You run with Venza. I'll hold Anita.\"\n\nHe nodded. \"But we must keep together, Gregg.\"\n\nWe could soon run freely. Down the ramp, out over the tumbled plain.\nBounding, grotesque, leaping strides. The girls were more agile, more\nskillful. They were soon leading us. The Earth shadows of their\nfigures leaped beside them. The _Planetara_ faded into the distance\nbehind us. Archimedes stood back there. Ahead, the mountains came\ncloser.\n\nAn hour perhaps. I lost track of time. Occasionally we stopped to\nrest. Were we going toward the Grantline camp? Would they see our tiny\nwaving headlights?\n\nAnother interval. Then far ahead of us on the ragged plain, lights\nshowed! Moving, tiny spots of light! Headlights on helmeted figures!\n\nWe ran, monstrously leaping. A group of figures were off there.\nGrantline's party? Snap gripped me.\n\n\"Grantline! We're safe, Gregg! Safe!\"\n\nHe took his bulb light from his helmet; we stood in a group while he\nwaved it. A semaphore signal.\n\n\"_Grantline?_\"\n\nAnd the answer came, \"_Yes. You, Dean?_\"\n\nTheir personal code. No doubt of this--it was Grantline, who had seen\nthe _Planetara_ fall and had come to help us.\n\nI stood then with my hand holding Anita. And I whispered, \"It's\nGrantline! We're safe, Anita, my darling!\"\n\nDeath had been so close! Those horrible last minutes on the\n_Planetara_ had shocked us, marked us. We stood trembling. And\nGrantline and his men came bounding up, weird, inflated figures.\n\nA helmeted figure touched me. I saw through the helmetpane the visage\nof a stern-faced, square-jawed young man.\n\n\"Grantline? Johnny Grantline?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said his voice at my ear-grid. \"I'm Grantline. You're Haljan?\nGregg Haljan?\"\n\nThey crowded around us. Gripped us, to hear our explanations.\n\nBrigands! It was amazing to Johnny Grantline. But the menace was over\nnow, over as soon as Grantline realized its existence.\n\nWe stood for a brief time discussing it. Then I drew apart, leaving\nSnap with Grantline. And Anita joined me. I held her arm so that we\nhad audiphone contact.\n\n\"Anita, mine.\"\n\n\"Gregg--dear one!\"\n\nMurmured nothings which mean so much to lovers!\n\nAs we stood in the fantastic gloom of Lunar desolation, with the\nblessed Earthlight on us, I sent up a prayer of thankfulness. Not that\nthe enormous treasure was saved. Not that the attack upon Grantline\nhad been averted. But only that Anita was given back to me. In moments\nof greatest emotion the human mind individualizes. To me, there was\nonly Anita.\n\nLife is very strange! The gate to the shining garden of our love\nseemed swinging wide to let us in. Yet I recall that a vague fear\nstill lay on me. A premonition?\n\nI felt a touch on my arm. A bloated helmet visor was thrust near my\nown. I saw Snap's face peering at me.\n\n\"Grantline thinks we should return to the _Planetara_. Might find some\nof them alive.\"\n\nGrantline touched me. \"It's only human--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said.\n\nWe went back. Some ten of us--a line of grotesque figures bounding\nwith slow, easy strides over the jagged, rock-strewn plain. Our lights\ndanced before us.\n\nThe _Planetara_ came at last into view. My ship. Again that pang swept\nme as I saw her. This, her last resting place. She lay here, in her\nopen tomb, shattered, broken, unbreathing. The lights on her were\nextinguished. The Erentz system had ceased to pulse--the heart of the\ndying ship, for a while beating faintly, but now at rest.\n\nWe left the two girls with some of Grantline's men at the admission\nport. Snap, Grantline and I, with three others, went inside. There\nstill seemed to be air, but not enough so that we dared remove our\nhelmets.\n\nIt was dark inside the wrecked ship. The corridors were black. The\nhull control rooms were dimly with Earthlight straggling through the\nwindows.\n\nThis littered tomb. Cold and silent with death. We stumbled over a\nfallen figure. A member of the crew. Grantline straightened from\nexamining it.\n\n\"Dead,\" he said.\n\nEarthlight fell on the horrible face. Puffed flesh, bloated red from\nthe blood which had oozed from its pores in the thinning air. I looked\naway.\n\nWe prowled further. Hahn lay dead in the pump room. The body of\nConiston should have been near here. We did not see it. We climbed up\nto the slanting, littered deck. The air up here had all almost hissed\naway.\n\nAgain Grantline touched me. \"That the turret?\"\n\nNo wonder he asked me! The wreckage was all so formless.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nWe climbed after Snap into the broken turret room. We passed the body\nof that steward who just at the end had appealed to me and I had left\ndying. The legs of the forward lookout still poked grotesquely up from\nthe wreckage of the observatory tower where it lay smashed down\nagainst the roof of the chart room.\n\nWe shoved ourselves into the turret. What was this? No bodies here!\nThe giant Miko was gone! The pool of blood lay congealed into a frozen\ndark splotch on the metal grid.\n\nAnd Moa was gone! They had not been dead. Had dragged themselves out\nof here, fighting desperately for life. We would find them somewhere\naround here.\n\nBut we did not. Nor Coniston. I recalled what Anita had said: other\nsuits and helmets had been here in the nearby chart room. The brigands\nhad taken them, and food and water doubtless, and escaped from the\nship, following us through the lower admission ports only a few\nminutes after we were gone.\n\nWe made careful search of the entire ship. Eight of the bodies which\nshould have been here were missing: Miko, Moa, Coniston and five of\nthe crew.\n\nWe did not find them outside. They were hiding near here, no doubt,\nmore willing to take their chances than to yield to us now. But how,\nin all this Lunar desolation, could we hope to locate them?\n\n\"No use,\" said Grantline. \"Let them go. If they want death, well, they\ndeserve it.\"\n\nBut we were saved. Then, as I stood there, realization leaped at me.\nSaved? Were we not indeed fatuous fools?\n\nIn all these emotion-swept moments since we had encountered Grantline,\nmemory of that brigand ship coming from Mars had never once occurred\nto Snap and me!\n\nI told Grantline now. He stared at me.\n\n\"What!\"\n\nI told him again. It would be here in eight days. Fully manned and\narmed.\n\n\"But Haljan, we have almost no weapons! All my _Comet's_ space was\ntaken with equipment and the mechanisms for my camp. I can't signal\nEarth! I was depending on the _Planetara_!\"\n\nIt surged upon us. The brigand menace past? We were blindly\ncongratulating ourselves on our safety! But it would be eight days or\nmore before in distant Ferrok-Shahn the nonarrival of the _Planetara_\nwould cause any real comment. No one was searching for us--no one was\nworried over us.\n\nNo wonder the crafty Miko was willing to take his chances out here in\nthe Lunar wilds! His ship, his reinforcements, his weapons were coming\nrapidly!\n\nAnd we were helpless. Almost unarmed. Marooned here on the Moon!\n\n\n\n\nXXIII\n\n\n\"Try it again,\" Snap urged. \"Good God, Johnny, we've got to raise some\nEarth station! Chance it! Use the power--run it up full. Chance it!\"\n\nWe were gathered in Grantline's instrument room. The duty man, with\nblanched grim face, sat at his senders. The Grantline crew shoved\nclose around us. There were very few observers in the high-powered\nEarth stations who knew that an exploring party was on the Moon.\nPerhaps none of them. The Government officials who had sanctioned the\nexpedition and Halsey and his confr\u00e8res in the Detective Bureau were\nnot anticipating trouble at this point. The _Planetara_ was supposed\nto be well on her course to Ferrok-Shahn. It was when she was due to\nreturn that Halsey would be alert.\n\nGrantline used his power far beyond the limits of safety. He cut down\nthe lights; the telescope intensifiers and television were completely\ndisconnected; the ventilators were momentarily stilled, so that the\nair here in the little room crowded with men rapidly grew fetid. All,\nto save power pressure, that the vital Erentz system might survive.\n\nEven so, it was strained to the danger point. Our heat was radiating\naway; the deadly chill of space crept in.\n\n\"Again!\" ordered Grantline.\n\nThe duty man flung on the power in rhythmic pulses. In the silence,\nthe tubes hissed. The light sprang through the banks of rotating\nprisms, intensified up the scale until, with a vague, almost invisible\nbeam, it left the last swaying mirror and leaped through our overhead\ndome and into space.\n\n\"Enough,\" said Grantline. \"Switch it off. We'll let it go at that for\nnow.\"\n\nIt seemed that every man in the room had been holding his breath in\nthe chill darkness. The lights came on again; the Erentz motors\naccelerated to normal. The strain on the walls eased up, and the room\nbegan warming.\n\nHad the Earth caught our signal? We did not want to waste the power to\nfind out. Our receivers were disconnected. If an answering signal\ncame, we could not know it. One of the men said:\n\n\"Let's assume they read us.\" He laughed, but it was a high-pitched,\ntense laugh. \"We don't dare even use the telescope or television. Or\nelectron radio. Our rescue ship might be right overhead, visible to\nthe naked eye, before we see it. Three days more--that's what I'll\ngive it.\"\n\nBut the three days passed and no rescue ship came. The Earth was\nalmost at the full. We tried signaling again. Perhaps it got\nthrough--we did not know. But our power was weaker now. The wall of\none of the rooms sprang a leak, and the men were hours repairing it. I\ndid not say so, but never once did I feel that our signals were read\non Earth. Those cursed clouds! The Earth almost everywhere seemed to\nhave poor visibility.\n\nFour of our eight days of grace were all too soon passed. The brigand\nship must be half way here by now.\n\nThey were busy days for us. If we could have captured Miko and his\nband, our danger would have been less imminent. With the treasure\ninsulated, and our camp in darkness, the arriving brigand ship might\nnever find us. But Miko knew our location; he would signal his\noncoming ship when it was close and lead it to us.\n\nDuring those three days--and the days which followed them--Grantline\nsent out searching parties. But it was unavailing. Miko, Moa and\nConiston, with their five underlings, could not be found.\n\nWe had at first hoped that the brigands might have perished. But that\nwas soon dispelled! I went--about the third day--with the party that\nwas sent to the _Planetara_. We wanted to salvage some of its\nequipment, its unbroken power units. And Snap and I had worked out an\nidea which we thought might be of service. We needed some of the\n_Planetara's_ smaller gravity plate sections. Those in Grantline's\nwrecked little _Comet_ had stood so long that their radiations had\ngone dead. But the _Planetara's_ were still working.\n\nOur hope that Miko might have perished was dashed. He too had returned\nto the _Planetara_! The evidence was clear before us. The vessel was\nstripped of all its power units save those which were dead and\nuseless. The last of the food and water stores were taken. The weapons\nin the chart room--the Benson curve lights, projectors and heat\nrays--had vanished!\n\nOther days passed. Earth reached the full and was waning. The fourteen\nday Lunar night was in its last half. No rescue ship came from Earth.\nWe had ceased our efforts to signal, for we needed all our power to\nmaintain ourselves. The camp would be in a state of siege before long.\nThat was the best we could hope for. We had a few short-range weapons,\nsuch as Bensons, heat-rays and projectors. A few hundred feet of\neffective range was the most any of them could obtain. The\nheat-rays--in giant form one of the most deadly weapons on Earth--were\nonly slowly efficacious on the airless Moon. Striking an intensely\ncold surface, their warming radiations were slow to act. Even in a\nblasting heat beam a man in his Erentz helmet-suit could withstand the\nray for several minutes.\n\nWe were, however, well equipped with explosives. Grantline had brought\na large supply for his mining operations, and much of it was still\nunused. We had, also, an ample stock of oxygen fuses, and a variety of\noxygen light flares in small, fragile glass globes.\n\nIt was to use these explosives against the brigands that Snap and I\nwere working out our scheme with the gravity plates. The brigand ship\nwould come with giant projectors and some thirty men. If we could hold\nout against them for a time, the fact that the _Planetara_ was missing\nwould bring us help from Earth.\n\nAnother day. A tenseness was upon all of us, despite the absorption of\nour feverish activities. To conserve power, the camp was almost dark,\nwe lived in dim, chill rooms, with just a few weak spots of light\noutside to mark the watchmen on their rounds. We did not use the\ntelescope, but there was scarcely an hour when one or the other of the\nmen was not sitting on a cross-piece up in the dome of the little\ninstrument room, casting a tense, searching gaze through his glasses\ninto the black, starry firmament. A ship might appear at any time\nnow--a rescue ship from Earth, or the brigands from Mars.\n\nAnita and Venza through these days could aid us very little save by\ntheir cheering words. They moved about the rooms, trying to inspire\nus; so that all the men, when they might have been humanly sullen and\ncursing their fate, were turned to grim activity, or grim laughter,\nmaking a joke of the coming siege. The morale of the camp now was\nperfect. An improvement indeed over the inactivity of their former\npeaceful weeks!\n\nGrantline mentioned it to me. \"Well put up a good fight, Haljan. These\nfellows from Mars will know they've had a task before they ever sail\noff with the treasure.\"\n\nI had many moments alone with Anita. I need not mention them. It\nseemed that our love was crossed by the stars, with an adverse fate\ndooming it. And Snap and Venza must have felt the same. Among the men,\nwe were always quietly, grimly active. But alone.... I came upon Snap\nonce with his arms around the little Venus girl. I heard him say:\n\n\"Accursed luck! That you and I should find each other too late, Venza.\nWe could have a lot of fun in Greater New York together.\"\n\n\"Snap, we will!\"\n\nAs I turned away, I murmured, \"And pray God, so will Anita and I.\"\n\nThe girls slept together in a small room of the main building. Often\nduring the time of sleep, when the camp was stilled except for the\nnight watch, Snap and I would sit in the corridor near the girls'\ndoor, talking of that time when we would all be back on our blessed\nEarth.\n\nOur eight days of grace were passed. The brigand ship was due--now,\ntomorrow, or the next day.\n\nI recall, that night, my sleep was fitfully uneasy. Snap and I had a\ncubby together. We talked, and made futile plans. I went to sleep, but\nawakened after a few hours. Impending disaster lay heavily upon me.\nBut there was nothing abnormal nor unusual in that!\n\nSnap was asleep. I was restless, but I did not have the heart to\nawaken him. He needed what little repose he could get. I dressed, left\nour cubby and wandered out into the corridor of the main building.\n\nIt was cold in the corridor, and gloomy with the weak blue light. An\ninterior watchman passed me.\n\n\"All as usual, Haljan.\"\n\n\"Nothing in sight?\"\n\n\"No. They're watching.\"\n\nI went through the connecting corridor to the adjacent building. In\nthe instrument room several of the men were gathered, scanning the\nvault overhead.\n\n\"Nothing, Haljan.\"\n\nI stayed with them awhile, then wandered away. An outside man met me\nnear the admission lock chambers of the main building. The duty man\nhere sat at his controls, raising the air pressure in the locks\nthrough which the outside watchman was coming. The relief sat here in\nhis bloated suit, with his helmet on his knees. It was Wilks.\n\n\"Nothing yet, Haljan. I'm going up to the peak of the crater to see if\nanything is in sight. I wish that damnable brigand ship would come and\nget it over with.\"\n\nInstinctively we all spoke in half whispers, the tenseness bearing in\non us.\n\nThe outside man was white and grim, but he grinned at Wilks. He tried\nthe familiar jest: \"Don't let the Earthlight get you!\"\n\nWilks went out through the ports--a process of no more than a minute.\nI wandered away again through the corridors.\n\nI suppose it was half an hour later that I chanced to be gazing\nthrough a corridor window. The lights along the rocky cliff were tiny\nblue spots. The head of the stairway leading down to the abyss of the\ncrater floor was visible. The bloated figure of Wilks was just coming\nup. I watched him for a moment making his rounds. He did not stop to\ninspect the lights. That was routine. I thought it odd that he passed\nthem.\n\nAnother minute passed. The figure of Wilks went with slow bounds over\ntoward the back of the ledge where the glassite shelter housed the\ntreasure. It was all dark off there. Wilks went into the gloom, but\nbefore I lost sight of him, he came back. As though he had changed his\nmind, he headed for the foot of the staircase which led up the cliff\nto where, at the peak of the little crater, five hundred feet above\nus, the narrow observatory was perched. He climbed with easy bounds,\nthe light on his helmet bobbing in the gloom.\n\nI stood watching. I could not tell why there seemed to be something\nqueer about Wilks' actions. But I was struck with it, nevertheless. I\nwatched him disappear over the summit.\n\nAnother minute went by. Wilks did not reappear. I thought I could make\nout his light on the platform up there. Then abruptly a tiny white\nbeam was waving from the observatory platform! It flashed once or\ntwice, then was extinguished. And now I saw Wilks plainly, standing in\nthe Earthlight, gazing down.\n\nQueer actions! Had the Earthlight touched him? Or was that a local\nsignal call which he sent out? Why should Wilks be signaling? What was\nhe doing with a hand helio? Our watchmen, I knew, had no reason to\ncarry one.\n\nAnd to whom could Wilks be signaling? To whom, across this Lunar\ndesolation? The answer stabbed at me: to Miko's band!\n\nI waited less than a moment. No further light. Wilks was still up\nthere!\n\nI went back to the lock entrance. Spare helmets and suits were here\nbeside the keeper. He gazed at me inquiringly.\n\n\"I'm going out, Franck. Just for a minute.\" It struck me that perhaps\nI was a meddlesome fool. Wilks, of all of Grantline's men, was, I\nknew, most in his commander's trust. The signal could have been some\npart of this night's ordinary routine, for all I knew.\n\nI was hastily donning an Erentz suit. I added, \"Let me out. I just got\nthe idea Wilks is acting strangely.\" I laughed. \"Maybe the Earthlight\nhas touched him.\"\n\nWith my helmet on, I went through the locks. Once outside, with the\nouter panel closed behind me, I dropped the weights from my belt and\nshoes and extinguished my helmet light.\n\nWilks was still up there. Apparently he had not moved. I bounded off\nacross the ledge to the foot of the ascending stairs. Did Wilks see me\ncoming? I could not tell. As I approached the stairs the platform was\ncut off from my line of vision.\n\nI mounted with bounding leaps. In my flexible gloved hand I carried my\nonly weapon, a small projector with firing caps for use in this\noutside near-vacuum.\n\nI held the weapon behind me. I would talk to Wilks first. I went\nslowly up the last hundred feet. Was Wilks still up there? The summit\nwas bathed in Earthlight. The little metal observatory platform came\ninto view above my head.\n\nWilks was not there. Then I saw him standing on the rocks nearby,\nmotionless. But in a moment he saw me coming.\n\nI waved my left hand with a gesture of greeting. It seemed to me that\nhe started, made as though to leap away, and then changed his mind. I\nsailed from the head of the staircase with a twenty foot leap and\nlanded lightly beside him. I gripped his arm for audiphone contact.\n\n\"Wilks!\"\n\nThrough my visor his face was visible. I saw him and he saw me. And I\nheard his voice:\n\n\"You, Haljan. How nice!\"\n\nIt was not Wilks, but the brigand Coniston.\n\n\n\n\nXXIV\n\n\nThe duty man at the exit locks stood at his window and watched me\ncuriously. He saw me go up the spider stairs. He could see the figure\nhe thought was Wilks, standing at the top. He saw me join Wilks, saw\nus locked together in combat.\n\nFor a brief instant the duty man stood amazed. There were two\nfantastic figures, fighting at the very brink of the cliff. They were\nsmall, dwarfed by distance, alternately dim and bright as they swayed\nin and out of the shadows. The duty man could not tell one from the\nother. To him it was Haljan and Wilks, fighting to the death!\n\nThe duty man sprang into action. An interior siren call was on the\ninstrument panel near him. He rang it frantically.\n\nThe men came rushing to him, Grantline among them.\n\n\"What's this? Good God, Franck!\"\n\nThey had seen the silent, deadly combat up there on the cliff.\n\nGrantline stood stricken with amazement. \"That's Wilks!\"\n\n\"And Haljan,\" the duty man gasped. \"He went out--something wrong with\nWilks' actions--\"\n\nThe interior of the camp was in a turmoil. The men, awakened from\nsleep, ran out into the corridors shouting questions.\n\n\"An attack?\"\n\n\"Is it an attack?\"\n\n\"The brigands?\"\n\nBut it was Wilks and Haljan in a fight up there on the cliff. The men\ncrowded at the bull's-eye windows.\n\nAnd over all the confusion the alarm siren, with no one thinking to\nshut it off, was screaming.\n\nGrantline, momentarily stricken, stood gazing. One of the figures\nbroke away from the other, bounded up to the summit from the stair\nplatform to which they had both fallen. The other followed. They\nlocked together, swaying at the brink. For an instant it seemed that\nthey would go over; then they surged back, momentarily out of sight.\n\nGrantline found his wits. \"Stop them! I'll go out and stop them! What\nfools!\"\n\nHe was hastily donning one of the Erentz suits. \"Cut off that siren!\"\n\nWithin a minute Grantline was ready. The duty man called from the\nwindow, \"Still at it, the fools. By the infernal--they'll kill\nthemselves!\"\n\n\"Franck, let me out.\"\n\n\"I'll go with you, Commander.\" But the volunteer was not equipped.\nGrantline would not wait.\n\nThe duty man turned to his panel. The volunteer shoved a weapon at\nGrantline.\n\nGrantline jammed on his helmet, took the weapon.\n\nHe moved the few steps into the air chamber which was the first of the\nthree pressure locks. Its interior door panel swung open for him. But\nthe door did not close after him!\n\nCursing the man's slowness, he waited a few seconds. Then he turned to\nthe corridor. The duty man came running.\n\nGrantline took off his helmet. \"What in hell--\"\n\n\"Broken! Dead!\"\n\n\"What!\"\n\n\"Smashed from outside,\" gasped the duty man. \"Look there--my tubes--\"\n\nThe control tubes of the ports had flashed into a short circuit and\nburned out. The admission ports would not open!\n\n\"And the pressure controls smashed! Broken from outside!\"\n\nThere was no way now of getting through the pressure locks. The doors,\nthe entire pressure lock system, was dead. Had it been tampered with\nfrom outside?\n\nAs if to answer Grantline's question there came a chorus of shouts\nfrom the men at the corridor windows.\n\n\"Commander! By God--look!\"\n\nA figure was outside, close to the building! Clothed in suit and\nhelmet, it stood, bloated and gigantic. It had evidently been lurking\nat the port entrance, had ripped out the wires there.\n\nIt moved past the windows, saw the staring faces of the men, and made\noff with giant bounds. Grantline reached the window in time to see it\nvanish around the building corner.\n\nIt was a giant figure, larger than an Earth man. A Martian?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUp on the summit of the crater the two small figures were still\nfighting. All this turmoil had taken no more than a minute or two.\n\nA lurking Martian outside? The brigand, Miko? More than ever,\nGrantline was determined to get out. He shouted to his men to don some\nof the other suits, and called for some of the hand projectors.\n\nBut he could not get out through these main admission ports. He could\nhave forced the panels open perhaps; but with the pressure changing\nmechanism broken, it would merely let the air out of the corridor. A\nrush of air, probably uncontrollable. How serious the damage was, no\none could tell as yet. It would perhaps take hours to repair it.\n\nGrantline was shouting, \"Get those weapons! That's a Martian outside!\nThe brigand leader, probably! Get into your suits, anyone who wants to\ngo with me! We'll go by the manual emergency exit.\"\n\nBut the prowling Martian had found it! Within a minute Grantline was\nthere. It was a smaller two-lock gateway of manual control, so that\nthe person going out could operate it himself. It was in a corridor at\nthe other end of the main building. But Grantline was too late! The\nlever would not open the panels!\n\nHad someone gone out this way and broken the mechanisms after him? A\ntraitor in the camp? Or had someone come in from outside? Or had the\nskulking Martian outside broken this lock as he had broken the other?\n\nThe questions surged on Grantline. His men crowded around him. The\nnews spread. The camp was a prison! No one could get out!\n\nAnd outside, the skulking Martian had disappeared. But Wilks and\nHaljan were still fighting. Grantline could see the two figures up on\nthe observatory platform. They bounded apart, then together again.\nCrazily swaying, bouncing, striking the rail.\n\nThey went together in a great leap off the platform onto the rocks,\nand rolled in a bright patch of Earthlight. First one on top, then the\nother.\n\nThey rolled unheeding to the brink. Here, beyond the midway ledge\nwhich held the camp, it was a sheer drop of a thousand feet, on down\nto the crater floor.\n\nThe figures were rolling; then one shook himself loose; rose up,\nseized the other and, with desperate strength, shoved him--\n\nThe victorious figure drew back to safety. The other fell, hurtling\ndown into the shadows past the camp level--down out of sight in the\ndarkness of the crater floor.\n\nSnap, who was in the group near Grantline at the window gasped, \"God!\nWas that Gregg who fell?\"\n\nNo one could say. No one answered. Outside, on the camp ledge, another\nhelmeted figure now became visible. It was not far from the main\nbuilding when Grantline first noticed it. It was running fast,\nbounding toward the spider staircase. It began mounting.\n\nAnd now still another figure became visible--the giant Martian again.\nHe appeared from around the corner of the main Grantline building. He\nevidently saw the winner of the combat on the cliff, who now was\nstanding in the Earthlight, gazing down. And he saw too, no doubt, the\nsecond figure mounting the stairs. He stood quite near the window\nthrough which Grantline and his men were gazing, with his back to the\nbuilding, looking up to the summit. Then he ran with tremendous leaps\ntoward the ascending staircase.\n\nWas it Haljan standing up there on the summit? Who was it climbing the\nstairs? And was the third figure Miko?\n\nGrantline's mind framed the questions. But his attention was torn from\nthem, and torn even from the swift silent drama outside. The corridor\nwas ringing with shouts.\n\n\"We're imprisoned! Can't get out! Was Haljan killed? The brigands are\noutside!\"\n\nAnd then an interior audiphone blared a calling for Grantline. Someone\nin the instrument room of the adjoining building was talking.\n\n\"Commander, I tried the telescope to see who got killed--\"\n\nBut he did not say who got killed, for he had greater news.\n\n\"Commander! The brigand ship!\"\n\nMiko's reinforcements had come.\n\n\n\n\nXXV\n\n\nNot Wilks, but Coniston! His drawling, British voice:\n\n\"You, Gregg Haljan! How nice!\"\n\nHis voice broke off as he jerked his arm from me. My hand with the\nprojector came up, but with a sweeping blow he struck my wrist. The\nweapon dropped to the rocks.\n\nI fought instinctively, those first moments; my mind was whirling with\nthe shock of surprise. This was not Wilks, but the brigand Coniston.\n\nIt was an eerie combat. We swayed; shoving, kicking, wrestling. His\nhold around my middle shut off the Erentz circulation; the warning\nbuzz rang in my ears, to mingle with the rasp of his curses. I flung\nhim off, and my Erentz motors recovered. He staggered away, but in a\ngreat leap came at me again.\n\nI was taller, heavier and far stronger than Coniston. But I found him\ncrafty, and where I was awkward in handling my lightness, he seemed\nmore skillfully agile.\n\nI became aware that we were on the twenty foot square grid of the\nobservatory platform. It had a low metal railing. We surged against\nit. I caught a dizzying glimpse of the abyss. Then it receded as we\nbounced the other way. And then we fell to the grid. His helmet bashed\nagainst mine, striking as though butting with the side of his head to\npuncture my visor panel. His gloved fingers were clutching at my\nthroat.\n\nAs we regained our feet, I flung him off, and bounded like a diver,\nhead first, into him. He went backward, but skillfully kept his feet\nunder him, gripped me again and shoved me.\n\nI was tottering at the head of the staircase--falling. But I clutched\nat him. We fell some twenty or thirty feet to be next lower spider\nlanding. The impact must have dazed us both. I recall my vague idea\nthat we must have fallen down the cliff.... My air shut off--then it\ncame again. The roaring in my ears was stilled; my head cleared, and I\nfound that we were on the landing, fighting.\n\nHe presently broke away from me, bounded to the summit with me after\nhim. In the close confines of the suit I was bathed in sweat and\ngasping. I had no thought to increase the oxygen control. I could not\nfind it; or it would not operate.\n\nI realized that I was fighting sluggishly, almost aimlessly. But so\nwas Coniston!\n\nIt seemed dreamlike. A phantasmagoria of blows and staggering steps. A\nnightmare with only the horrible vision of this goggled helmet always\nbefore my eyes.\n\nIt seemed that we were rolling on the ground, back on the summit. The\nunshadowed Earthlight was clear and bright. The abyss was beside me.\nConiston, rolling, was now on top, now under me, trying to shove me\nover the brink. It was all like a dream--as though I were asleep,\ndreaming that I did not have enough air.\n\nI strove to keep my senses. He was struggling to roll me over the\nbrink. God, that would not do! But I was so tired. One cannot fight\nwithout oxygen!\n\nI suddenly knew that I had shaken him off and gained my feet. He rose,\nswaying. He was as tired, confused, as nearly asphyxiated as I.\n\nThe brink of the abyss was behind us. I lunged, desperately shoving,\navoiding his clutch.\n\nHe went over, and fell soundlessly, his body whirling end over end\ndown into the shadows, far below.\n\nI drew back. My senses faded as I sank panting to the rocks. But with\ninactivity, my heart quieted. My respiration slowed. The Erentz\ncirculation gained on my poisoned air. It purified.\n\nThat blessed oxygen! My head cleared. Strength came. I felt better.\n\nConiston had fallen to his death. I was victor. I went to the brink\ncautiously, for I was still dizzy. I could see, far down there on the\ncrater floor, a little patch of Earthlight in which a mashed human\nfigure was lying.\n\nI staggered back again. A moment or two must have passed while I stood\nthere on the summit, with my senses clearing and my strength renewed\nas the blood stream cleared in my veins.\n\nI was victor. Coniston was dead. I saw now, down on the lower\nstaircase below the camp ledge, another goggled figure lying huddled.\nThat was Wilks, no doubt. Coniston had probably caught him there,\nsurprised him, killed him.\n\nMy attention, as I stood gazing, went down to the camp buildings.\nAnother figure was outside! It bounded along the ledge, reached the\nfoot of the stairs at the top of which I was standing. With agile\nleaps, it came mounting at me!\n\nAnother brigand! Miko? No, it was not large enough to be Miko. I was\nstill confused. I thought of Hahn. But that was absurd: Hahn was in\nthe wreck of the _Planetara_. One of the stewards then....\n\nThe figure came up the staircase recklessly, to assail me. I took a\nstep backward, bracing myself to receive this new antagonist. And then\nI looked further down and saw Miko! Unquestionably he, for there was\nno mistaking his giant figure. He was down on the camp ledge, running\ntoward the foot of the stairs.\n\nI thought of my revolver. I turned to try and find it. I was aware\nthat the first of my assailants was at the stairhead. I swung back to\nsee what this oncoming brigand was doing. He was on the summit: with a\nsailing leap he launched for me. I could have bounded away, but with a\nlast look to locate the revolver, I braced myself for the shock.\n\nThe figure hit me. It was small and light in my clutching arms. I\nrecall I saw that Miko was halfway up the stairs. I gripped my\nassailant. The audiphone contact brought a voice.\n\n\"Gregg, is it you?\"\n\nIt was Anita!\n\n\n\n\nXXVI\n\n\n\"Gregg, you're safe!\"\n\nShe had heard the camp corridors resounding with the shouts that Wilks\nand Haljan were fighting. She had come upon a suit and helmet by the\nmanual emergency lock, had run out through the lock, confused, with\nher only idea to stop Wilks and me from fighting. Then she had seen\none of us killed. Impulsively, barely knowing what she was doing, she\nmounted the stairs, frantic to find if I were alive.\n\n\"Anita!\"\n\nMiko was coming fast! She had not seen him; for she had no thought of\nbrigands--only the belief that either Wilks or I had been killed.\n\nBut now, as we stood together on the rocks near the observatory\nplatform, I could see the towering figure of Miko nearing the top of\nthe stairs.\n\n\"Anita, that's Miko! We must run!\"\n\nThen I saw my projector. It lay in a bowl-like depression quite near\nus. I jumped for it. And as I tore loose from Anita, she leaped down\nafter me. It was a broken bowl in the rocks, some six feet deep. It\nwas open on the side facing the stairs--a narrow, ravinelike gully,\nfull of gray, broken, tumbled rock masses. The little gully was\nlittered with crags and boulders. But I could see out through it.\n\nMiko had come to the head of the stairs. He stopped there, his great\nfigure etched sharply by the Earthlight. I think he must have known\nthat Coniston was the one who had fallen over the cliff, as my helmet\nand Coniston's were different enough for him to recognize which was\nwhich. He did not know who I was, but he did know me for an enemy.\n\nHe stood now at the summit, peering to see where we had gone. He was\nno more than fifty feet from us.\n\n\"Anita, lie down.\"\n\nI pulled her down on the rocks. I took aim with my projector. But I\nhad forgotten our helmet lights. Miko must have seen them just as I\npulled the trigger. He jumped sidewise and dropped, but I could see\nhim moving in the shadows to where a jutting rock gave him shelter. I\nfired, missing him again.\n\nI had stood up to take aim. Anita pulled me sharply down beside her.\n\n\"Gregg, he's armed!\"\n\nIt was his turn to fire. It came--the familiar vague flash of the\nparalyzing ray. It spat its tint of color on the rocks near us, but\ndid not reach us.\n\nA moment later, Miko bounded to another rock.\n\nTime passed--only a few seconds. I could not see Miko momentarily.\nPerhaps he was crouching; perhaps he had moved away again. He was, or\nhad been, on slightly higher ground than the bottom of our bowl. It\nwas dim down here where we were lying, but I feared that any moment\nMiko might appear and strike at us. His ray at any short range would\npenetrate our visor panes, even though our suits might temporarily\nresist it.\n\n\"Anita, it's too dangerous here!\"\n\nHad I been alone, I might perhaps have leapt up to lure Miko. But with\nAnita I did not dare chance it.\n\n\"We've got to get back to camp,\" I told her.\n\n\"Perhaps he has gone--\"\n\nBut he had not. We saw him again, out in a distant patch of\nEarthlight. He was further from us than before, but on still higher\nground. We had extinguished our small helmet lights. But he knew we\nwere here and possibly he could see us. His projector flashed again.\nHe was a hundred feet or more away now, and his weapon was of no\nlonger range than mine. I did not answer his fire, for I could not\nhope to hit him at such a distance, and the flash of my weapon would\nhelp him to locate us.\n\nI murmured to Anita, \"We must get away.\"\n\nYet how did I dare take Anita from these concealing shadows? Miko\ncould reach us so easily as we bounded away in plain view in the\nEarthlight of the open summit! We were caught, at bay in this little\nbowl.\n\nThe camp was not visible from here. But out through the broken gully,\na white beam of light suddenly came up from below.\n\n_Haljan._ It spelled the signal.\n\nIt was coming from the Grantline instrument room, I knew.\n\nI could answer it with my helmet light, but I did not dare.\n\n\"Try it,\" urged Anita.\n\nWe crouched where we thought we might be safe from Miko's fire. My\nlittle light beam shot up from the bowl. It was undoubtedly visible to\nthe camp.\n\n_Yes, I am Haljan. Send us help._\n\nI did not mention Anita. Miko doubtless could read these signals. They\nanswered, _Cannot_--\n\nI lost the rest of it. There came a flash from Miko's weapon. It gave\nus confidence: he was unable to reach us at this distance.\n\nThe Grantline beam repeated:\n\n_Cannot come out. Ports broken. You cannot get in. Stay where you are\nfor an hour or two. We may be able to repair ports._\n\nI extinguished my light. What use was it to tell Grantline anything\nfurther? Besides, my light was endangering us. But the Grantline beam\nspelled another message:\n\n_Brigand ship is coming. It will be here before we can get out to you.\nNo lights. We will try and hide our location._\n\nAnd the signal beam brought a last appeal:\n\n_Miko and his men will divulge where we are unless you can stop them._\n\nThe beam vanished. The lights of the Grantline camp made a faint glow\nthat showed above the crater edge. The glow died, as the camp now was\nplunged into darkness.\n\n\n\n\nXXVII\n\n\nWe crouched in the shadows, the Earthlight filtering down to us. The\nskulking figure of Miko had vanished; but I was sure he was out there\nsomewhere on the crags, lurking, maneuvering to where he could strike\nus with his ray. Anita's metal-gloved hand was on my arm; in my\near-diaphragm her voice sounded eager:\n\n\"What was the signal, Gregg?\"\n\nI told her everything.\n\n\"Oh Gregg! The Martian ship coming!\"\n\nHer mind clung to that as the most important thing. But not so myself.\nTo me there was only the realization that Anita was caught out here,\nalmost at the mercy of Miko's ray. Grantline's men could not get out\nto help us, nor could I get Anita into the camp.\n\nShe added, \"Where do you suppose the ship is?\"\n\n\"Twenty or thirty thousand miles up, probably.\"\n\nThe stars and the Earth were visible over us. Somewhere up there,\ndisclosed by Grantline's instruments but not yet discernible to the\nnaked eye, Miko's reinforcements were hovering.\n\nWe lay for a moment in silence. It was horribly nerve straining. Miko\ncould be creeping up on us. Would he dare chance my sudden fire?\nCreeping--or would he make a swift, unexpected rush?\n\nThe feeling that he was upon us abruptly swept me. I jumped to my\nfeet, against Anita's effort to hold me. Where was he now? Was my\nimagination playing me tricks?...\n\nI sank back. \"That ship should be here in a few hours.\"\n\nI told her what Grantline's signal had suggested; the ship was\nhovering overhead. It must be fairly close; for Grantline's telescope\nhad revealed its identity as an outlaw flyer, unmarked by any of the\nstandard code identification lights. It was doubtless too far away as\nyet to have located the whereabouts of Grantline's camp. The Martian\nbrigands knew that we were in the vicinity of Archimedes, but no more\nthan that. Searching this glowing Moon surface, our tiny local\nsemaphore beams would certainly pass unnoticed.\n\nBut as the brigand ship approached now--dropping close to Archimedes\nas it probably would--our danger was that Miko and his men would then\nsignal it, join it, and reveal the camp's location. And the brigand\nattack would be upon us!\n\nI told this now to Anita. \"The signal from Grantline said, '_Unless\nyou can stop them._'\"\n\nIt was an appeal to me. But how could I stop them? What could I do,\nalone out here with Anita, to cope with this enemy?\n\nAnita made no comment.\n\nI added, \"That ship will land near Archimedes, within an hour or two.\nIf Grantline can repair the ports, and I can get you inside....\"\n\nAgain she made no comment. Then suddenly she gripped me. \"Gregg, look\nthere!\"\n\nOut through the gully break in our bowl the figure of Miko showed! He\nwas running. But not at us. Circling the summit, leaping to keep\nhimself behind the upstanding crags. He passed the head of the\nstaircase; he did not descend it, but headed off along the summit of\nthe crater rim.\n\nI stood up to watch him. \"Where's he going!\"\n\nI let Anita stand up beside me, cautiously at first, for it occurred\nto me it might be a ruse to cover some other of Miko's men who might\nbe lurking near.\n\nBut the summit seemed clear. The figure of Miko was a thousand feet\naway now. We could see the tiny blob of it bobbing over the rocks.\nThen it plunged down--not into the crater valley, but out toward the\nopen Moon surface.\n\nMiko had abandoned his attack on us. The reason seemed plain. He had\ncome here from his encampment with Coniston ahead to lure and kill\nWilks. When this was done, Coniston had flashed his signal to Miko,\nwho was hiding nearby.\n\nIt was not like the brigand leader to remain in the background. Miko\nwas no coward. But Coniston could impersonate Wilks, whereas Miko's\ngiant stature at once would reveal his identity. Miko had been engaged\nin smashing the ports. He had looked up and seen me kill Coniston. He\nhad come to assail me. And then he had read Grantline's message to me.\nIt was his first knowledge that his ship was at hand. With the camp\nexits inoperative, Grantline and his men were imprisoned. Miko had\nmade an effort to kill me. He did not know my companion was Anita. But\nthe effort was taking too long; with his ship at hand, it was Miko's\nbest move to return to his own camp, rejoin his men, and await their\nopportunity to signal the ship.\n\nAt least, so I reasoned it. Anita and I stood alone. What could we do?\n\nWe went to the brink of the cliff. The unlighted Grantline buildings\nshowed vaguely in the Earthlight.\n\nI said, \"We'll go down. I'll leave you there. You can wait at the\nport. They'll repair it soon.\"\n\n\"And what will you do, Gregg?\"\n\nI did not intend to tell her. \"Hurry, Anita!\"\n\n\"Gregg, let me go with you.\"\n\nShe jerked away from me and bounded back up the stairs. I caught her\non the summit.\n\n\"Anita!\"\n\n\"I'm going with you.\"\n\n\"You're going to stay here.\"\n\n\"I'm not!\"\n\nThis exasperating controversy!\n\n\"Anita, please.\"\n\n\"I'll be safer with you than waiting here, Gregg.\" And she added,\n\"Besides, I won't stay and you can't make me.\"\n\nWe ran along the crater top. At its distant edge the lower plain\nspread before us. Far down, and far away on the distant broken\nsurface, the leaping figure of Miko showed. He plunged down the broken\nouter slope, reached the level. Soon, as we ran, the little Grantline\ncrater faded behind us.\n\nAnita ran more skillfully than I. Ten minutes or so passed. We had\nseen Miko and the direction he was taking, but down here on the plain\nwe could no longer see him. It struck me that our chase was\npurposeless and dangerous. Suppose Miko were to see us following him?\nSuppose he stopped and lay in ambush to fire at us as we came leaping\nheedlessly by?\n\n\"Anita, wait!\"\n\nI drew her down amid a group of tumbled boulders. And then abruptly\nshe clung to me.\n\n\"Gregg, I know what we can do! Gregg, don't tell me you won't let me\ntry it!\"\n\nI listened to her plan. Incredible! Incredibly dangerous. Yet, as I\npondered it, the very daring of the scheme seemed the measure of its\npossible success. The brigands would never imagine we could be so\nrash!\n\n\"But Anita--\"\n\n\"Gregg, you're stupid!\" It was her turn to be exasperated.\n\nBut I was in no mood for daring. My mind was obsessed with Anita's\nsafety. I had been planning that we might see the glow of Miko's\nencampment and decide on some course of action.\n\n\"But, Gregg, the safety of the treasure--of all the Grantline men....\"\n\n\"To the infernal with that! It's you, your safety--\"\n\n\"My safety, then! If you put me in the camp and the brigands attack it\nand I am killed--what then? But this plan of mine, if we can do it,\nGregg, will mean safety in the end for all of us.\"\n\nAnd it seemed possible. We crouched, discussing it. So daring a thing!\n\nThe brigand ship would come down near Archimedes. That was fifty miles\nfrom Grantline. The brigands from Mars would not have seen the dark\nGrantline buildings hidden in the little crater pit. They would wait\nfor Miko and his men to make their whereabouts known.\n\nMiko's encampment was ahead of us now, undoubtedly. We had been\nfollowing him toward the Mare Imbrium. Or at least, we hoped so. He\nwould signal his ship. But Anita and I, closer to it, would also\nsignal it; and, posing as brigands, would join it!\n\n\"Remember, Gregg, I remain Anita Prince, George's sister.\" Her voice\ntrembled as she mentioned her dead brother. \"They know that George was\nin Miko's pay, and I as his sister, will help to convince them.\"\n\nThis daring scheme! If we could join the ship, we might be able to\npersuade its leader that Miko's distant signals were merely a ruse of\nGrantline to lure the brigands in that direction. A long range\nprojector from the ship would kill Miko and his men as they came\nforward to join it! And then we would falsely direct the brigands,\nlead them away from Grantline and the treasure.\n\n\"Gregg, we must try it.\"\n\nHeaven help me, I yielded to her persuasion!\n\nWe turned at right angles and ran toward where the distant frowning\nwalls of Archimedes loomed against the starlit sky.\n\n\n\n\nXXVIII\n\n\nThe broken, shaggy ramparts of the giant crater rose above us. We\ntoiled upward, out of the foothills, clinging now to the crags and\npitted terraces of the main ascent. An hour had passed since we turned\nfrom the borders of Mare Imbrium. Or was it two hours? I could not\ntell. I only know that we ran with desperate, frantic haste.\n\nAnita would not admit that she was tired. She was more skillful than I\nin this leaping over the broken rock masses. Yet I felt that her\nslight strength must give out. It seemed miles up the undulating\nslopes of the foothills with the black and white ramparts of the\ncrater close before us.\n\nAnd then the main ascent. There were places where, like smooth black\nfrozen ice, the walls rose sheer. We avoided them, toiling aside,\nplunging into gullies, crossing pits where sometimes, perforce, we\nwent downwards, and then up again. Or sometimes we stood, hot and\nbreathless, upon ledges, recovering our strength, selecting the best\nroute upward.\n\nIn tumbled mass of rock, honeycombed everywhere with caves and\npassages leading into impenetrable darkness, there were pits into\nwhich we might so easily have fallen; ravines to span, sometimes with\na leap, sometimes by a long and arduous detour.\n\nEndless climb. We came to the ledge with the plains of the Mare\nImbrium stretching out beneath us. We might have been upon this main\nascent for an hour; the plains were far down, the broken surface down\nthere smoothed now by the perspective of height. And yet still above\nus the brooding circular wall went up into the sky. Ten thousand feet\nabove us.\n\n\"You're tired, Anita. We'd better stay here.\"\n\n\"No. If we could only get to the top--the ship may land on the other\nside--they would see us.\"\n\nThere was as yet no sign of the brigand ship. With every stop for\nrest we searched the starry vault. The Earth hung over us, flattened\nbeyond the full. The stars blazed to mingle with the Earthlight and\nillumine these massive crags of the Archimedes walls. But no speck\nappeared to tell us that the ship was up there.\n\nWe were on the curving side of the Archimedes wall which fronted the\nMare Imbrium to the north. The plains lay Like a great frozen sea,\ncongealed ripples shining in the light of the Earth, with dark patches\nto mark the hollows. Somewhere down there--six or eight thousand feet\nbelow us now--Miko's encampment lay concealed. We searched for lights\nof it, but could see none.\n\nHad Miko rejoined his party, left his camp and come here like\nourselves to climb Archimedes? Or was our assumption wholly wrong:\nperhaps the brigand ship would not land near here at all!\n\nSweeping around from the Mare Imbrium, the plains were less smooth.\nThe little crater which concealed the Grantline camp was off in the\ncrater-scarred region beyond which the distant Apennines raised their\nterraced walls. There was nothing to mark it from here.\n\n\"Gregg, do you see anything up there?\" She added, \"There seems to be a\nblur.\"\n\nHer sight, sharper than mine, had picked it out. The descending\nbrigand ship! A faintest, tiny blur against the stars, a few of them\nocculted as though an invisible shadow were upon them. A growing\nshadow, materializing into a blur--a blob, a shape faintly defined.\nThen sharper until we were sure of what we saw. It was the brigand\nship. It was dropping slowly, silently down.\n\nWe crouched on the little ledge. A cave mouth was behind us. A gully\nwas beside us, a break in the ledge; and at our feet the sheer wall\ndropped.\n\nWe had extinguished our lights. We crouched, silently gazing up into\nthe stars.\n\nThe ship, when we first distinguished it, was centered over\nArchimedes. We thought for a while that it might descend into the\ncrater. But it did not; it came sailing forward.\n\nI whispered into the audiphone, \"It's coming over the crater.\"\n\nHer hand pressed my arm in answer.\n\nI recalled that when, from the _Planetara_, Miko had forced Snap to\nsignal this brigand band on Mars, Miko's only information as to the\nwhereabouts of the Grantline camp was that it lay between Archimedes\nand the Apennines. The brigands now were following that information.\n\nA tense interval passed. We could see the ship plainly above us now, a\ngray-black shape among the stars up beyond the shaggy, towering crater\nrim. The vessel came upon a level keel, hull down. Slowly circling,\nlooking for Miko's signal, no doubt, or for possible lights from\nGrantline's camp. They might also be picking a landing place.\n\nWe saw it soon as a cylindrical, cigarlike shape, rather smaller than\nthe _Planetara_, but similar of design. It bore lights now. The ports\nof its hull were tiny rows of illumination, and the glow of light\nunder its rounding upper dome was faintly visible.\n\nA bandit ship, no doubt of that. Its identification keel plate was\nempty of official pass code lights. These brigands had not attempted\nto secure official sailing lights when leaving Ferrok-Shahn. It was\nunmistakably an outlaw ship. And here upon the deserted Moon there was\nno need for secrecy. Its lights were openly displayed, that Miko might\nsee it and join it.\n\nIt went slowly past us, only a few thousand feet higher than our\nlevel. We could see the whole outline of its pointed cylinder hull,\nwith the rounded dome on top. And under the dome was its open deck\nwith a little cabin superstructure in the center.\n\nI thought for a moment that by some unfortunate chance it might land\nquite near us. But it went past. And then I saw that it was heading\nfor a level, plateaulike surface a few miles further on. It dropped,\ncautiously floating down.\n\nThere was still no sign of Miko. But I realized that haste was\nnecessary. We must be the first to join the brigand ship.\n\nI lifted Anita to her feet. \"I don't think we should signal from\nhere.\"\n\n\"No. Miko might see it.\"\n\nWe could not tell where he was. Down on the plains, perhaps? Or up\nhere, somewhere in these miles of towering rocks?\n\n\"Are you ready, Anita?\"\n\n\"Yes, Gregg.\"\n\nI stared through the visors at her white solemn face.\n\n\"Yes, I'm ready,\" she repeated.\n\nHer hand pressure seemed to me suddenly like a farewell. We were\nplunging rashly into what was destined to mean our death? Was this a\nfarewell?\n\nAn instinct told me not to do this thing. Why, in a few hours I could\nhave Anita back to the comparative safety of the Grantline camp. The\nexit ports would doubtless be repaired by now. I could get her inside.\n\nShe had bounded away from me, leaped down some thirty feet into the\nbroken gully, to cross it and then up on the other side. I stood for\nan instant watching her fantastic shape, with the great rounded,\ngoggled, trunked helmet and the lump on her shoulders which held the\nlittle Erentz motors. Then I hurried after her.\n\nIt did not take us long--two or three miles of circling along the\ngiant wall. The ship lay only a few hundred feet above our level.\n\nWe stood at last on a buttelike pinnacle. The lights of the ship were\nclose over us. And there were moving lights up there, tiny moving\nspots on the adjacent rocks. The brigands had come out, prowling about\nto investigate their location.\n\nNo signal yet from Miko. But it might come at any moment.\n\n\"I'll flash now,\" I whispered.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nThe brigands had probably not yet seen us. I took the lamp from my\nhelmet. My hand was trembling. Suppose my signal were answered by a\nshot? A flash from some giant projector mounted on the ship?\n\nAnita crouched behind a rock, as she had promised. I stood with my\ntorch and flung its switch. My puny light beam shot up. I waved it,\ntouched the ship with its faint glowing circle of illumination.\n\nThey saw me. There was a sudden movement among the lights up there.\n\nI semaphored:\n\n_I am from Miko. Do not fire._\n\nI used open universal code. In Martian first, and then in English.\n\nThere was no answer, but no attack. I tried again.\n\n_This is Haljan, one of the_ Planetara. _George Prince's sister is\nwith me. There has been disaster to Miko._\n\nA small light beam came down from the brink of the overhead cliff\nbeside the ship.\n\n_Continue._\n\nI went steadily on: _Disaster--the_ Planetara _is wrecked. All killed\nbut me and Prince's sister. We want to join you._\n\nI flashed off my light. The answer came:\n\n_Where is the Grantline Camp?_\n\n_Near here. The Mare Imbrium._\n\nAs though to answer my lie, from down on the Earthlit plains, some ten\nmiles or so from the crater base, a tiny signal light shot up. Anita\nsaw it and gripped me.\n\n\"There is Miko's light!\"\n\nIt spelled in Martian, _Come down. Land Mare Imbrium._\n\nMiko had seen the signaling up here and had joined it! He repeated,\n_Land Mare Imbrium._\n\nI flashed a protest up to the ship: _Beware. That is Grantline!\nTrickery._\n\nFrom the ship the summons came, _Come up._\n\nWe had won this first encounter! Miko must have realized his\ndisadvantage. His distant light went out.\n\n\"Come, Anita.\"\n\nThere was no retreat now. But again I seemed to feel in the pressure\nof her hand that vague farewell. Her voice whispered, \"We must do our\nbest, act our best to be convincing.\"\n\nIn the white glow of a searchbeam we climbed the crags, reached the\nbroad upper ledge. Helmeted figures rushed at us, searched us for\nweapons, seized our helmet lights. The evil face of a giant Martian\npeered at me through the visors. Two other monstrous, towering figures\nseized Anita.\n\nWe were shoved toward the port locks at the base of the ship's hull.\nAbove the hull bulge I could see the grids of projectors mounted on\nthe dome side, and the figures of men standing on the deck, peering\ndown at us.\n\nWe went through the admission locks into a hull corridor, up an\nincline passage, and reached the lighted deck. The Martian brigands\ncrowded around us.\n\n\n\n\nXXIX\n\n\nAnita's words echoed in my memory: \"We must do our best to be\nconvincing.\" It was not her ability that I doubted, as much as my own.\nShe had played the part of George Prince cleverly, unmasked only by an\nevil chance.\n\nI steeled myself to face the searching glances of the brigands as they\nshoved around us. This was a desperate game into which we had plunged.\nFor all our acting, how easy it would be for some small chance thing\nabruptly to undo us! I realized it, and now, as I gazed into the\npeering faces of these men from Mars, I cursed myself for the witless\nrashness which had brought Anita into this!\n\nThe brigands--some ten or fifteen of them here on deck--stood in a\nring around us. They were all big men, nearly of a seven-foot average,\ndressed in leather jerkins and short leather breeches, with bare knees\nand flaring leather boots. Piratical swaggering fellows, knife-blades\nmingled with small hand projectors fastened to their belts. Gray,\nheavy faces, some with scraggly, unshaven beards. They plucked at us,\njabbering in Martian.\n\nOne of them seemed the leader. I said sharply, \"Are you the commander\nhere? You speak the Earth English?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said readily. \"I am commander here.\" He spoke English with\nthe same freedom and accent as Miko. \"Is this George Prince's sister?\"\n\n\"Yes. Her name is Anita Prince. Tell your men to take their hands off\nher.\"\n\nHe waved his men away. They all seemed more interested in Anita than\nin me. He added:\n\n\"I am _Set_ Potan.\" He addressed Anita. \"George Prince's sister? You\nare called Anita? I have heard of you. I knew your brother--indeed,\nyou look very much like him.\"\n\nHe swept his plumed hat to the grid with a swaggering gesture of\nhomage. A courtierlike fellow this, debonair as a Venus cavalier!\n\nHe accepted us. I realized that Anita's presence was extremely\nvaluable in making us convincing. Yet there was about this Potan--as\nwith Miko--a disturbing suggestion of irony. I could not make him out.\nI decided that we had fooled him. Then I remarked the steely glitter\nof his eyes as he turned to me.\n\n\"You were an officer of the _Planetara_?\"\n\nThe insignia of my rank was visible on my white jacket collar which\nshowed beneath the Erentz suit now that my helmet was off.\n\n\"Yes. I was supposed to be. But a year ago I embarked upon this\nadventure with Miko.\"\n\nHe was leading us to his cabin. \"The _Planetara_ wrecked? Miko dead?\"\n\n\"And Hahn and Coniston. George Prince too. We are the only survivors.\"\n\nWhile we divested ourselves of the Erentz suits, at his command, I\ntold him briefly of the _Planetara's_ fall. All had been killed on\nboard, save Anita and me. We had escaped, awaited his coming. The\ntreasure was here; we had located the Grantline camp, and were ready\nto lead him to it.\n\nDid he believe me? He listened quietly. He seemed not shocked at the\ndeath of his comrades. Nor yet pleased: merely imperturbable.\n\nI added with a sly, sidelong glance, \"There were too many of us on the\n_Planetara_. The purser had joined us and many of the crew. And there\nwas Miko's sister, the _Setta_ Moa--too many. The treasure divides\nbetter among less.\"\n\nAn amused smile played on his thin gray lips. But he nodded. The fear\nwhich had leaped at me was allayed by his next words.\n\n\"True enough, Haljan. He was a domineering fellow, Miko. A third of it\nall was for him alone. But now....\"\n\nThe third would go to this sub-leader, Potan! The implication was\nobvious.\n\nI said, \"Before we go any further, I can trust you for my share?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\nI figured that my very boldness in bargaining so prematurely would\nconvince him. I insisted, \"Miss Prince will have her brother's share?\"\n\nClever Anita! She put in swiftly, \"Oh, I give no information until you\npromise! We know the location of the Grantline camp, its weapons, its\ndefences, the amount and location of the treasure. I warn you, if you\ndo not play us fair....\"\n\nHe laughed heartily. He seemed to like us. He spread his huge legs as\nhe lounged in his settle, and drank of the bowl which one of his men\nset before him.\n\n\"Little tigress! Fear me not--I play fair!\" He pushed two of the bowls\nacross the table. \"Drink, Haljan. All is well with us and I am glad to\nknow it. Miss Prince, drink my health as your leader.\"\n\nI waved it away from Anita. \"We need all our wits; your strong Martian\ndrinks are dangerous. Look here, I'll tell you just how the situation\nstands--\"\n\nI plunged into a glib account of our supposed wanderings to find the\nGrantline camp: its location off the Mare Imbrium--hidden in a\ncavern there. Potan, with the drink, and under the gaze of Anita's\neyes, was in high good humor. He laughed when I told him that we had\ndared to invade the Grantline camp, had smashed its exit ports, had\neven gotten up to have a look where the treasure was piled.\n\n\"Well done, Haljan. You're a fellow to my liking!\" But his gaze was on\nAnita. \"You dress like a man or a charming boy.\"\n\nShe still wore the dark clothes of her brother. She said, \"I am used\nto action. Man's garb pleases me. You shall treat me like a man and\ngive me my share of gold leaf.\"\n\nHe had already demanded the reason for the signal from the Mare\nImbrium. Miko's signal! It had not come again, though any moment I\nfeared it. I told him that Grantline doubtless had repaired his\ndamaged ports and sallied out to assail me in reprisal. And, seeing\nthe brigand ship landing on Archimedes, had tried to lure him into a\ntrap.\n\nI wondered if my explanation was convincing: it did not sound so. But\nhe was flushed now with drink, and Anita added:\n\n\"Grantline knows the territory near his camp very well. But he is\nequipped only for short range fighting.\"\n\nI took it up. \"It's like this, Potan: if he could get you to land\nunsuspectingly near his cavern--\"\n\nI pictured how Grantline might have figured on a sudden surprise\nattack upon the ship. It was his only chance to catch it unprepared.\n\nWe were all three in friendly, intimate mood now. Potan said, \"We'll\nland down there right enough! But I need a few hours for my\nassembling.\"\n\n\"He will not dare advance,\" I said.\n\nAnita put in, smiling, \"He knows by now that we have unmasked his\nlure. Haljan and I, joining you--that silenced him. His light went out\nvery promptly, didn't it?\"\n\nShe flashed me a side gaze. Were we acting convincingly? But if Miko\nstarted up his signals again, they might so quickly betray us!\nAnita's thoughts were upon that, for she added:\n\n\"Grantline will not dare show his light! If he does, _Set_ Potan, we\ncan blast him from here with a ray. Can't we?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Potan agreed. \"If he comes within ten miles, I have one\npowerful enough. We are assembling it now.\"\n\n\"And we have thirty men?\" Anita persisted. \"When we sail down to\nattack him, it should not be difficult to kill all the Grantline\nparty.\"\n\n\"By heaven, Haljan, this girl of yours is small, but very\nbloodthirsty!\"\n\n\"And I'm glad Miko is dead,\" Anita added.\n\nI explained, \"That accursed Miko murdered her brother.\"\n\nActing! And never once did we dare relax. If only Miko's signals would\nhold off and give us time!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe may have talked for half an hour. We were in a small steel-lined\ncubby, located in the forward deck of the ship. The dome was over it.\nI could see from where I sat at the table that there was a forward\nobservatory tower under the dome quite near here. The ship was laid\nout in rather similar fashion to the _Planetara_, though considerably\nsmaller.\n\nPotan had dismissed his men from the cubby so as to be alone with us.\nOut on the deck I could see them dragging apparatus about, bringing\nthe mechanisms of giant projectors up from below and beginning to\nassemble them. Occasionally some of the men would come to our cubby\nwindows to peer in curiously.\n\nMy mind was roaming as I talked. For all my manner of casualness, I\nknew that haste was necessary. Whatever Anita and I were to do must be\nquickly done.\n\nBut to win this fellow's utter confidence first was necessary, so that\nwe might have the freedom of the ship, might move about unnoticed,\nunwatched.\n\nI was horribly tense inside. Through the dome windows across the deck\nfrom the cubby, the rocks of the Lunar landscape were visible. I could\nsee the brink of this ledge upon which the ship lay, the descending\ncrags down the precipitous wall of Archimedes to the Earthlit plains\nfar below. Miko, Moa, and a few of the _Planetara's_ crew were down\nthere somewhere.\n\nAnita and I had a fairly definite plan. We were now in Potan's\nconfidence; this interview at an end, I felt that our status among the\nbrigands would be established. We would be free to move about the\nship, join in its activities. It ought to be possible to locate the\nsignal room, get friendly with the operator there.\n\nPerhaps we could find a secret opportunity to flash a signal to Earth.\nThis ship, I was confident, would have the power for a long range\nsignal, if not of too sustained a length. It would be a desperate\nthing to attempt, but our whole procedure was desperate! Anita could\nlure the duty man from the signal room, I might send a single flash or\ntwo that would reach the Earth. Just a distress signal, signed\n\"Grantline.\" If I could do that and not get caught!\n\nAnita was engaging Potan in talking of his plans. The brigand leader\nwas boasting of them: of his well equipped ship, the daring of his\nmen. And questioning her about the size of the treasure. My thoughts\nwere free to roam.\n\nWhile we were making friends with this brigand, the longest range\nelectronic projector was being assembled. Miko then could flash his\nsignal and be damned to him! I would be on the deck with that\nprojector. Its operator and I would turn it upon Miko--one flash of it\nand he and his little band would be wiped out.\n\nBut there was our escape to be thought of. We could not remain very\nlong with these brigands. We could tell them that the Grantline camp\nwas on the Mare Imbrium. It would delay them for a time, but our lie\nwould soon be discovered. We must escape from them, get away and back\nto Grantline. With Miko dead, a distress signal to Earth, and Potan in\nignorance of Grantline's location, the treasure would be safe until\nhelp arrived from Earth.\n\n\"By the infernal, little Anita, you look like a dove, but you're a\ntigress! A comrade after my own heart--bloodthirsty as a\nfire-worshipper!\"\n\nHer laugh rang out to mingle with his. \"Oh no, _Set_ Potan! I am\ntreasure-thirsty.\"\n\n\"We'll get the treasure. Never fear, little Anita.\"\n\n\"With you to lead us, I'm sure we will.\"\n\nA man entered the cubby. Potan looked frowningly around. \"What is it,\nArgle?\"\n\nThe fellow answered in Martian, leered at Anita and withdrew.\n\nPotan stood up. I noticed that he was unsteady with the drink.\n\n\"They want me with the work at the projectors.\"\n\n\"Go ahead,\" I said.\n\nHe nodded. We were comrades now. \"Amuse yourself, Haljan. Or come out\non deck if you wish. I will tell my men you are one of us.\"\n\n\"And tell them to keep their hands off Miss Prince.\"\n\nHe stared at me. \"I had not thought of that: a woman among so many\nmen!\"\n\nHis own gaze at Anita was as offensive as any of his men could have\ngiven. He said, \"Have no fear, little tigress.\"\n\nAnita laughed. \"I'm afraid of nothing.\"\n\nBut when he had lurched from the cabin, she touched me. Smiled with\nher mannish swagger, for fear we were still observed, and murmured:\n\n\"Oh Gregg, I am afraid!\"\n\nWe stayed in the cubby a few moments, whispering and planning.\n\n\"You think the signal room is in the tower, Gregg? This tower outside\nour window here?\"\n\n\"Yes, I think so.\"\n\n\"Shall we go out and see?\"\n\n\"Yes. Keep near me always.\"\n\n\"Oh Gregg, I will!\"\n\nWe deposited our Erentz suits carefully in a corner of the cubby. We\nmight need them so suddenly! Then we swaggered out to join the\nbrigands working on the deck.\n\n\n\n\nXXX\n\n\nThe deck glowed lurid in the queer blue-greenish glare of Martian\nelectro-fuse lights. It was in a bustle of ordered activity. Some\ntwenty of the crew were scattered about, working in little groups.\nApparatus was being brought up from below to be assembled. There was a\npile of Erentz suits and helmets, of Martian pattern, but still very\nsimilar to those with which Grantline's expedition was equipped. There\nwere giant projectors of several kinds, some familiar to me, others of\na fashion I had never seen before. It seemed there were six or eight\nof them, still dismantled, with a litter of their attendant batteries\nand coils and tube amplifiers.\n\nThey were to be mounted here on the deck, I surmised; I saw in the\ndome side one or two of them already rolled into position.\n\nAnita and I stood outside Potan's cubby, gazing around us curiously.\nThe men looked at us but none of them spoke.\n\n\"Let's watch from here a moment,\" I whispered. She nodded, standing\nwith her hand on my arm. I felt that we were very small, here in the\nmidst of these seven foot Martian men. I was all in white, the costume\nused in the warm interior of Grantline's camp. Bareheaded, white silk\n_Planetara_ uniform jacket, broad belt and tight-laced trousers. Anita\nwas a slim black figure beside me, somber as Hamlet, with her pale\nboyish face and wavy black hair.\n\nThe gravity being maintained here on the ship we had found to be\nstronger than that of the Moon and rather more like Mars.\n\n\"There are the heat rays, Gregg.\"\n\nA pile of them was visible down the deck length. And I saw caskets of\nfragile glass globes, bombs of different styles, hand projectors of\nthe paralyzing ray; search beams of several varieties; the Benson\ncurve light, and a few side arms of ancient Earth design--swords and\ndirks, and small bullet projectors.\n\nThere seemed to be some mining equipment also. Far along the deck,\nbeyond the central cabin in the open space of the stern, steel rails\nwere stacked; half a dozen tiny-wheeled ore carts; a tiny motor engine\nfor hauling them and what looked as though it might be the dismembered\nsections of an ore chute.\n\nThe whole deck was presently strewn with this mass of equipment.\n\nPotan moved about, directing the different groups of workers. The news\nhad spread that we knew the location of the treasure. The brigands\nwere jubilant. In a few hours the ship's armament would be ready, and\nit would advance.\n\nI saw many glances cast out the dome side windows toward the distant\nplains of the Mare Imbrium. The brigands believed that the Grantline\ncamp lay in that direction.\n\nAnita whispered, \"Which is their giant electronic projector, Gregg?\"\n\nI could see it amidships of the deck. It was already in place. Potan\nwas there now, superintending the men who were connecting it. The most\npowerful weapon on the ship. It had, Potan said, an effective range of\nsome ten miles. I wondered what it would do to a Grantline building!\nThe Erentz double walls would withstand it for a time, I was sure. But\nit would blast an Erentz fabric suit, no doubt of that. Like a\nlightning bolt, it would kill--its flashing free stream of electrons\nshocking the heart, bringing instant death.\n\nI whispered, \"We must smash that before we leave! But first turn it on\nMiko, if he signals now.\"\n\nI was tensely watchful for that signal. The electronic projector\nobviously was not ready. But when it was connected, I must be near it,\nto persuade its duty man to fire it on Miko. With this done we would\nhave more time to plan our other tasks. I did not think Potan would be\nready for his attack before another time of sleep here in the ship's\nroutine. Things would be quieter then; I would watch my chance to send\na signal to Earth, and then we would escape.\n\nWith my thoughts roving, we had been standing quietly at the cubby\ndoor for about fifteen minutes. My hand in my side pouch clutched the\nlittle bullet projector. The brigands had taken it from me and given\nit to Potan. He had placed it on the settle with my Erentz suit; and\nwhen we gained his confidence he had forgotten it and left it there. I\nhad it now, and the feel of its cool sleek handle gave me a measure of\ncomfort. Things could go wrong so easily. But if they did, I was\ndetermined to sell my life as dearly as possible. And a vague thought\nwas in my mind: I must not use the last bullet. That would be for\nAnita.\n\n\"That electronic projector is remote controlled. Look, Anita, that's\nthe signal room over us. The giant projector will be aimed and fired\nfrom up there.\"\n\nA thirty foot skeleton tower stood on the deck near us, with a spiral\nladder leading up to a small, square, steel cubby at the top. Through\nthe cubby window I could see instrument panels. A single Martian was\nup there; he had called down to Potan concerning the electronic\nprojector.\n\nThe roof of this little tower room was close under the dome--a space\nof no more than four feet. A pressure lock exit in the dome was up\nthere, with a few steps leading up to it from the roof of the tower\nsignal room.\n\nWe could escape that way, perhaps. In the event of dire necessity it\nmight be possible. But only as a desperate resort, for it would put us\non the top of the glassite dome, with a sheer hundred feet or more\ndown its sleek bulging exterior side, and down the outside bulge of\nthe ship's hull, to the rocks below. There might be a spider ladder\noutside leading downward, but I saw no evidence of it. If Anita and I\nwere forced to escape that way, I wondered how we could manage a\nhundred foot jump to the rocks, and land safely. Even with the slight\ngravity of the Moon, it would be a dangerous fall.\n\n\"You are Gregg Haljan?\"\n\nI stared as one of the brigands, coming up behind, addressed me.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Commander Potan tells me you were chief navigator of the\n_Planetara_?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You shall pilot us when we advance upon the Grantline camp. I am\ncontrol-commander here--Brotow, my name.\"\n\nHe smiled. A giant fellow, but spindly. He spoke good English. He\nseemed anxious to be friendly.\n\n\"We are glad to have you and George Prince's sister with us.\" He shot\nAnita an admiring glance. \"I will show you our controls, Haljan.\"\n\n\"All right,\" I said. \"Whatever I can do to help....\"\n\n\"But not now. It will be some hours before we are ready.\"\n\nI nodded, and he wandered away. Anita whispered: \"Did he mean that\nsignal room up in the tower? Oh Gregg, maybe it's only the control\nroom.\"\n\n\"Suppose we go up and see? Miko's signals might start any minute.\"\n\nAnd the electronic projector seemed about ready. It was time for me to\nact. But a reluctant instinct was upon me. Our Erentz suits were close\nbehind us in Potan's cubby. I hated to leave them. If anything\nhappened, and we had to make a sudden dash, there would be no time to\ngarb ourselves in the suits. To adjust the helmets would be bad\nenough.\n\nI whispered swiftly, \"We must get into our suits--find some pretext.\"\nI drew her back through the cubby doorway where we would be more\nsecluded.\n\n\"Anita, listen. I've been a fool not to plan our escape more\ncarefully. We're in too great a danger here!\"\n\nSuddenly it seemed to me that we were in desperate plight! Was it\npremonition?\n\n\"Anita, listen: if anything happens and we have to make a dash--\"\n\n\"Up through that dome lock, Gregg? It's a manual control; you can see\nthe levers.\"\n\n\"Yes. It's a manual. But once up there how would we get down?\"\n\nShe was far calmer than I. \"There may be an outside ladder, Gregg.\"\n\n\"I don't think so. I haven't seen it.\"\n\n\"Then we can get out the way they brought us in. The hull port--it's a\nmanual, too.\"\n\n\"Yes, I think I can find our way down through the hull corridors.\"\n\n\"There are guards outside on the rocks.\"\n\nWe had seen them through the dome windows. But there were not many,\nonly two or three. I was armed and a surprise rush would do the trick.\n\nWe donned our Erentz suits.\n\n\"What will we do with the helmets?\" demanded Anita. \"Leave them here?\"\n\n\"No, take them with us. I'm not going to get separated from them!\"\n\n\"We'll look strange going up to that signal room equipped like this.\"\n\n\"I can't help it, Anita. We'll explain it, somehow.\"\n\nShe stood before me, a queer-looking little figure in the now\ndeflated, bagging suit with her slim neck and head protruding above\nit.\n\n\"Carry your helmet, Anita. Ill take mine.\"\n\nWe could adjust the helmets and start the motors all within a few\nseconds.\n\n\"I'm ready, Gregg.\"\n\n\"Come on, then. Let me go first.\"\n\nI had the bullet projector in an outer pouch of the suit where I could\ninstantly reach it. This was more rational; we had a fighting chance\nnow. The fear which had swept me began to recede.\n\n\"We'll climb the tower to the signal room,\" I whispered. \"Do it\nboldly.\"\n\nWe stepped from the cubby. Potan was not in sight; perhaps he was on\nthe further deck beyond the central cabin structure.\n\nOn the deck, we were immediately accosted. This was different--our\nappearance in the Erentz suits!\n\n\"Where are you going?\" This fellow spoke in Martian.\n\nI answered in English, \"Up there.\"\n\nHe stood before us, towering over me. I saw a group of nearby workers\nstop to regard us. In a moment we would be causing a commotion, and it\nwas the last thing I desired.\n\nI said in Martian, \"Commander Potan told me, what I wish I can do.\nFrom the dome we look around to see where is the Grantline camp from\nhere. I am pilot of this ship to go there.\"\n\nThe man who had called himself Brotow passed near us. I appealed to\nhim.\n\n\"We put on our suits. After our experience, we feel safer that way. If\nI'm to pilot the ship....\"\n\nHe hesitated, his glance sweeping the deck as though to ask Potan.\nSomeone said in Martian:\n\n\"The Commander is down in the stern storeroom.\"\n\nIt decided Brotow. He waved away the Martian who had stopped me.\n\n\"Let them pass.\"\n\nAnita and I gave him our most friendly smiles.\n\n\"Thanks.\"\n\nHe bowed to Anita with a sweeping gesture. \"I will show you over the\ncontrol room presently.\"\n\nHis gaze went to the peak of the bow.\n\nThe little hooded cubby there was the control room, then. Satisfaction\nswept me. Then above us in the tower, must surely be the signal room.\nWould Brotow follow us up? I hoped not. I wanted to be alone with the\nduty man up there, giving me a chance to get at the projector controls\nif Miko's signal should come.\n\nI drew Anita past Brotow, who had stood aside. \"Thanks,\" I repeated.\n\"We won't be long.\"\n\nWe mounted the little ladder.\n\n\n\n\nXXXI\n\n\n\"Hurry, Anita!\"\n\nI feared that Potan might come up from the hull at any moment and stop\nus. The duty man over us gazed down, his huge head and shoulders\nblocking the small signal room window. Brotow called up in Martian,\ntelling him to let us come. He scowled, but when we reached the trap\nin the room floor grid, we found him standing aside to admit us.\n\nI flung a swift glance around. It was a metallic cubby, not much over\nfifteen feet square, with an eight foot arched ceiling. There were\ninstrument panels. The range finder for the giant projector was here;\nits telescope with the trajectory apparatus and the firing switch were\nunmistakable. And the signaling apparatus was here! Not a Martian set,\nbut a fully powerful Botz ultra-violet sender with its attendant\nreceiving mirrors. The _Planetara_ had used the Botz system, so I was\nthoroughly familiar with it.\n\nI saw too, what seemed to be weapons: a row of small fragile glass\nglobes, hanging on clips along the wall--bombs, each the size of a\nman's fist. And a broad belt with bombs in its padded compartments.\n\nMy heart was pounding as my first quick glance took in these details.\nI saw also that the room had four small oval window openings. They\nwere breast high above the floor; from the deck below I knew that the\nangle of vision was such that the men down there could not see into\nthis room except to glimpse its upper portion near the ceiling. And\nthe helio set was banked on a low table near the floor.\n\nIn a corner of the room a small ladder led through a ceiling trap to\nthe cubby roof. This upper trap was open. Four feet above the room's\nroof was the arch of the dome, with the entrance to the exit-lock\ndirectly above us. The weapons and the belt of bombs were near the\nascending ladder, evidently placed here as equipment for use from the\ntop of the dome.\n\nI turned to the solitary duty man. I must gain his confidence at once.\nAnita had laid her helmet aside. She spoke first.\n\n\"We were with _Set_ Miko,\" she said smilingly, \"in the wreck of the\n_Planetara_. You heard of it? We know where the treasure is.\"\n\nThis duty man was a full seven feet tall, and the most heavy-set\nMartian I had ever seen. A tremendous, beetle-browed, scowling fellow.\nHe stood with hands on his hips, his leather-garbed legs spread wide;\nand as I confronted him, I felt like a child.\n\nHe was silent, glaring down at me as I drew his attention from Anita.\n\n\"You speak English?\" I asked. \"We are not skilled with Martian.\"\n\nI wondered if at the next time of sleep this fellow would be on duty\nhere. I hoped not: it would not be easy to trick him and find an\nopportunity to flash a signal. But that task was some hours away as\nyet; I would worry about it when the time came. Just now I was\nconcerned with Miko and his little band, who at any moment might\narrive in sight. If we could persuade this duty man to turn the\nprojector on them!\n\nHe answered me in ready English:\n\n\"You are the man Gregg Haljan? And this is the sister of George\nPrince--what do you want up here?\"\n\n\"I am a navigator. Brotow wants me to pilot the ship when we advance\nto attack Grantline.\"\n\n\"This is not the control room.\"\n\n\"No, I know it isn't.\"\n\nI put my helmet carefully on the floor beside Anita's. I straightened\nto find the brigand gazing at her. He did not speak: he was still\nscowling. But in the dim blue glow of the cubby, I caught the look in\nhis eyes.\n\nI said hastily, \"Grantline knows your ship has landed here on\nArchimedes. His camp is off there on the Mare Imbrium. He sent up a\nsignal--you saw it, didn't you?--just before Miss Prince and I came\naboard. He was trying to pretend he was your Earth party, Miko and\nConiston.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nThe fellow turned his scowl on me, but Anita brought his gaze back to\nher. She put in quickly:\n\n\"Grantline, as brother always said, has no great cunning. I believe\nnow he plans to creep up on us unawares, by pretending that he is\nMiko.\"\n\n\"If he does that,\" I said, \"we will turn this electronic projector on\nhim and his party and annihilate them. You have its firing mechanism\nhere.\"\n\n\"Who told you so?\" he shot at me.\n\nI gestured. \"I see it here. It's obvious: I'm skilled at trajectory\nfiring. If Grantline appears down there now, I'll help you.\"\n\n\"Is it connected?\" Anita demanded boldly.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"You have on your Erentz suits: are you going to the\ndome roof? Then go.\"\n\nBut that was what we did not want to do. Anita's glance seemed to tell\nme to let her handle this. I turned toward one of the cubby windows.\n\nShe said sweetly, \"Are you in charge of this room? Show me how the\nprojector is operated. I know it will be invincible against the\nGrantline camp.\"\n\nI had my back to them for a moment. Through the breast-high oval I\ncould see down across the deck-space and out through the side dome\nwindows. And my heart suddenly leaped into my throat. It seemed that\ndown there in the Earthlit shadows, where the spreading base of the\ngiant crater joined the plains, a light was bobbing. I gazed,\nstricken. Miko's lights? Was he advancing, preparing to signal? I\ntried to gauge the distance; it was not over two miles from here.\n\nOr was it not a light at all? With the naked eye, I could not be sure.\nPerhaps there was a telescope finder here in the cubby....\n\nI was subconsciously aware of the voices of Anita and the duty man\nbehind me. Then abruptly I heard Anita's low cry. I whirled around.\n\nThe giant Martian had gathered her into his huge arms, his heavy\njowled gray face, with a leering grin, close to hers!\n\nHe saw me coming. He held her with one arm! his other flung at me,\ncaught me, knocked me backward. He rasped:\n\n\"Get out of here! Go up to the dome--\"\n\nAnita was silently struggling with her little hands at his thick\nthroat. His blow flung me against a settle. But I held my feet. I was\npartly behind him. I leaped again, and as he tried to disengage\nhimself from Anita to front me, her clutching fingers impeded him.\n\nMy projector was in my hand. But in that second as I leaped, I had the\nsense to realize I should not fire it because its noise would alarm\nthe ship. I grasped its barrel, reached upward and struck with its\nheavy metal butt. The blow caught the Martian on the skull, and\nsimultaneously my body struck him.\n\nWe went down together, falling partly upon Anita. But the giant had\nnot cried out, and as I gripped him now, I felt his body go limp. I\nlay panting. Anita squirmed silently from under us. Blood from the\ngiant's head was welling out, hot and sticky against my face as I lay\nsprawled on him.\n\nI cast him off. He was dead, his fragile Martian skull split open by\nmy blow.\n\nThere had been no alarm. The slight noise we made had not been heard\ndown on the busy deck. Anita and I crouched by the floor. From the\ndeck all this part of the room could not be seen.\n\n\"Dead.\"\n\n\"Oh Gregg--\"\n\nIt forced our hand. I could not wait now for Miko to come. But I could\nflash the Earth signal now, and then we would have to make our run to\nescape.\n\nThen I remembered that light down by the base! I kept Anita out of\nsight down on the floor and went cautiously to a window. The deck was\nin turmoil with brigands moving about excitedly. Not because of what\nhad happened in our tower signal room: they were unaware of that.\n\nMiko's signals were showing! I could see them now plainly, down at the\ncrater base. A group of hand lights and small waving helio beam.\n\nAnd they were being answered from the ship! Potan was on the deck--a\nbabble of voices, above which his rose with roars of command. At one\nof the dome windows a brigand with a hand searchbeam was sending its\nanswering light. And I saw that Potan was working over a deck\ntelescope finder.\n\nIt had all come so suddenly that I was stunned. But I did not wait to\nread the signals. I swung back at Anita, who stared helplessly at me.\n\n\"It's Miko! And they are answering him! Get your helmet: I'll try\nfiring the projector.\"\n\nOr would I instead try and send a brief flash signal to Earth? There\nwould be no time to do both: we must escape out of here. The route up\nthrough the dome was the only feasible one now.\n\nThis range mechanism of the projector was reasonably familiar, and I\nfelt that I could operate it. The range-finder and the switch were on\na ledge at one of the windows. I rushed to it. As I swung the\ntelescope, training it down on Miko's lights, I could see the huge\nprojector on the deck swinging similarly. Its movement surprised the\nmen who were attending it. One of them called up to me, but I ignored\nhim.\n\nThen Potan looked up and saw me. He shouted in Martian at the duty\nman, whom he doubtless thought was behind me: \"Be ready! We may fire\non them. I'll give you the word.\"\n\nThe signals were proceeding. It had only been a moment. I caught\nsomething like, \"_Haljan is imposter_.\"\n\nI was aiming the projector. I was aware of Anita at my elbow. I pushed\nher back.\n\n\"Put on your helmet!\"\n\nI had the range. I flung the firing switch.\n\nAt the deck window the giant projector spat its deadly electronic\nstream. The men down there leaped away from it in surprise. I heard\nPotan's voice, his shout of protest and anger.\n\nBut down in the Earth glow at the crater base, Miko's lights had not\nvanished! I had missed! An error in the range? Abruptly I knew it was\nnot that. Miko's lights were still there. His signals still coming.\nAnd I noticed now a faint distortion about them, the glow of his\nlittle group of hand lights faintly distorted and vaguely shot with a\ngreenish cast. Benson curve lights!\n\nMy thoughts whirled in the few seconds while I stood there at the\ntower window. Miko had feared he might be summarily fired on. He had\ngone back to his camp, equipped all his lights with the Benson curve.\nHe was somewhere at the crater base now. But not where I thought I saw\nhim! The Benson curve light changed the path of the light rays\ntraveling from him to me, I could not even approximate his true\nposition!\n\nAnita was plucking at me. \"Gregg, come.\"\n\n\"I can't hit him,\" I gasped.\n\nShould I try the flash signal to Earth? Did we dare linger here? I\nstood another few seconds at the window. I saw Potan down in the\nconfusion of the deck, training a telescope. He had shouted up\nviolently at his duty man here not to fire again.\n\nAnd now he let out a roar. \"I can see them! It's Miko! By the\nAlmighty--his giant stature--Brotow, look! That's not an Earth man!\"\n\nHe flung aside his telescope finder. \"Disconnect that projector! It's\nMiko down there! This Haljan is a trickster! Where is he?\nBraile--Braile, you accursed fool! Are Haljan and the girl up there\nwith you?\"\n\nBut the duty man lay in his blood at our feet.\n\nI had dropped back from the window. Anita and I crouched for an\ninstant in confusion, fumbling with our helmets.\n\nThe ship rang with the alarm. And amid the turmoil we could hear the\nshouts of the infuriated brigands swarming up the tower ladder after\nus!\n\n\n\n\nXXXII\n\n\nI was only inactive a moment. I had thought Anita would have on her\nhelmet. But she was reluctant, or confused.\n\n\"Anita, we've got to get out of here! Up through the overhead locks to\nthe dome.\"\n\n\"Yes.\" She fumbled with her helmet. The climbing men on the ladder\nwere audible. They were already nearing the top. The trap door was\nclosed; Anita and I were crouching on it. There was a thick metal bar\nset in a depressed groove for the grid. I slid it in place; it would\nseal the trap for a short time.\n\nA degree of confidence came to me. We had a few moments before there\ncould be any hand-to-hand conflict. The giant electronic projector\nwould eventually be used against Grantline; it was the brigands' most\npowerful weapon. Its controls were here, by Heaven, I would smash\nthem? That at least I could do!\n\nI jumped for the window. Miko's signals had stopped, but I caught a\nglimpse of his distant moving curve lights.\n\nA flash came up at me, as in the window I became visible to the\nbrigands on the ship's deck. It was a small hand projector, hastily\nfired, for it went wide of the window. It was followed by a rain of\nsmall beams, but I was warned and dropped my head beneath the sill.\nThe rays flashed dangerously upward through the oval opening, hissed\nagainst our vaulted roof. The air snapped and tingled with a shower\nof blue-red sparks, and the acrid odor of the released gases settled\ndown upon us.\n\nThe trajectory controls of the projector were beside me. I seized\nthem, ripped and tore at them. There was a roar down on the deck. The\nprojector had exploded. A man's agonizing scream split the confusion\nof sounds.\n\nIt silenced the brigands on the deck. Under our floor grid, those on\nthe ladder had been pounding at the trap door. They stopped, evidently\nto see what had happened. The bombardment of our windows stopped\nmomentarily.\n\nI cautiously peered out the window again. In the wreck of the\nprojector, three men were lying. One of them was screaming horribly.\nThe dome side was damaged. Potan and other men were frantically\ninvestigating to see if the ship's air was hissing out.\n\nA triumph swept over me. They had not found me so meek and inoffensive\nas they might have thought!\n\nAnita clutched me. She still had not donned her helmet.\n\n\"Put on your helmet!\"\n\n\"But Gregg--\"\n\n\"Put it on!\"\n\n\"I.... I don't want to put it on until you put yours on.\"\n\n\"I've smashed the projector! We've stopped them coming up for a\nwhile.\"\n\nBut they were still on the ladder under our floor. They heard our\nvoices: they began thumping again. Then pounding. They seemed now to\nhave heavy implements. They rammed against the trap.\n\nThe floor seemed holding. The square of metal grid trembled, yielded a\nlittle. But it was good for a few minutes longer.\n\nI called down, \"The first one who comes through will be shot!\" My\nwords mingled with their oaths. There was a moment's pause, then the\nramming went on. The dying man on the deck was still screaming.\n\nI whispered, \"I'll try an Earth signal.\"\n\nShe nodded. Pale, tense, but calm. \"Yes, Gregg. And I was thinking--\"\n\n\"It won't take a minute. Have your helmet ready.\"\n\n\"I was thinking--\" She hurried across the room.\n\nI swung on the Botz signaling apparatus. It was connected. Within a\nmoment I had it humming. The fluorescent tubes lighted with their\nlurid glare; they painted purple the body of the giant duty man who\nlay sprawled at my feet. I drew on all the ship's power. The tube\nlights in the room quivered and went dim.\n\nI would have to hurry. Potan could shut this off from the main hull\ncontrol room. I could see, through the room's upper trap, the primary\nsending mirror mounted in the peak of the dome. It was quivering,\nradiant with its light energy. I sent the flash.\n\nThe flattened past full Earth was up there. I knew that the Western\nHemisphere faced the Moon at this hour. I flashed in English, with the\nopen Universal Earth code:\n\n_Help. Grantline._\n\nAnd again: _Help. Archimedes region near Apennines. Attacked by\nbrigands._\n\n_Send help at once. Grantline._\n\nIf only it would be received! I flung off the current. Anita stood\nwatching me intently. \"Gregg, look!\"\n\nI saw that she had taken some of the glass globe-bombs which lay by\nthe foot of the ascending ladder. \"Gregg, I threw some of them.\"\n\nAt the window we gazed down. The globes she flung had shattered on the\ndeck. They were darkness bombs.\n\nThrough the blackness of the deck, the shouts of the brigands came up.\nThey were stumbling about. But the ramming of our trap went on, and I\nsaw that it was beginning to yield.\n\n\"We've got to go, Anita!\"\n\nFrom out of the darkness which hung like a shroud over the deck an\noccasional flash came up, unaimed, wide of our windows. But the\ndarkness was dissipating. I could see now the dim glow of the deck\nlights, blurred as through a heavy fog.\n\nI dropped another of the bombs.\n\n\"Put on your helmet.\"\n\n\"Yes--yes, I will. You put yours on.\"\n\nWe had them adjusted in a moment. Our Erentz motors were pumping.\n\nI gripped her. \"Put out your helmet light.\"\n\nShe extinguished it. I handed her my projector.\n\n\"Hold it a moment. I'm going to take that belt of bombs.\"\n\nThe trap door was all but broken under the ramming blows of the men. I\nleaped over the body of the dead duty man, seized the belt of bombs\nand strapped it around my waist.\n\n\"Give me the projector.\"\n\nShe handed it to me. The trap door burst upward! A man's head and\nshoulders appeared. I fired a bullet into him--the leaden pellet\nsinging down through the yellow powder flash that spat from the\nprojector's muzzle.\n\nThe brigand screamed, and dropped back out of sight. There was\nconfusion at the ladder top. I flung a bomb at the broken trap. A tiny\nheat ray came wavering up through the opening, but went wide of us.\n\nThe instrument room was in darkness. I clung to Anita.\n\n\"Hold on to my hand. You go first--here is the ladder!\"\n\nWe found it in the blackness, mounted it and went through the cubby's\nroof-trap.\n\nI took another look and dropped another bomb beside us. The four foot\nspace up here between the cubby roof and the overhead dome, went\nblack. We were momentarily concealed.\n\nAnita located the manual levers of the lock-entrance.\n\n\"Here, Gregg.\"\n\nI shoved at them. Fear leaped in me that they would not operate. But\nthey swung. The tiny port opened wide to receive us. We clambered into\nthe small air-chamber; the door slid closed, just as a flash from\nbelow struck at it. The brigands had seen our cloud of darkness and\nwere firing up through it.\n\nIn a moment we were out on the dome top. A sleek, rounded spread of\nglassite, with broad aluminite girders. There were cross ribs which\ngave us a footing, and occasionally projections--streamline fin-tips,\nthe casings of the upper rudder shafts, and the upstanding stubby\nfunnels into which helicopters were folded.\n\nWe moved along the central footpath and crouched by a six-foot casing.\nThe stars and the glowing Earth were over us. The curving dome top--a\nhundred feet or so in length, and bulging thirty feet wide beneath\nus--glistened in the Earthlight. It was a sheer drop and down these\ncurving sides past the ship's hull, a hundred feet to the rocks on\nwhich the vessel rested. The towering wall of Archimedes was beside\nus; and beyond the brink of the ledge the thousands of feet down to\nthe plains.\n\nI saw the lights of Miko's band down there. He had stopped signaling.\nHis little lights were spread out, bobbing as he and his men advanced\nup the crater's foothills, coming to join the ship.\n\nI had an instant's glimpse. Anita and I could not stay here. The\nbrigands would follow us up in a moment. I saw no exterior ladder. We\nwould have to take our chances and jump.\n\nThere were brigands down there on the rocks. I saw three or four\nhelmeted figures, and they saw us! A bullet whizzed by us, and then\ncame the flash of a hand ray.\n\nI touched Anita. \"Can you make the leap? Anita dear....\"\n\nAgain it seemed that this must be farewell.\n\n\"Gregg, dear one, we've got to do it!\"\n\nThose waiting figures would pounce on us.\n\n\"Anita, lie here a moment.\"\n\nI jumped up and ran twenty feet toward the bow; then back toward the\nstern, flinging down the last of my bombs. The darkness was like a\ncloud down there, enveloping the outer brigands. But up there we were\nabove it, etched by the starlight and Earthglow.\n\nI came back to Anita. \"We'll have to chance it now.\"\n\n\"Gregg....\"\n\n\"Good-bye, dear. I'll jump first, down this side, you follow.\"\n\nTo leap into that black patch, with the rocks under it....\n\n\"Gregg--\"\n\nShe was trying to tell me to look overhead. She gestured, \"Gregg,\nsee!\"\n\nI saw it, out over the plains, a little speck amid the stars. A moving\nspeck, coming toward us!\n\n\"Gregg, what is it?\"\n\nI gazed, held my breath. A moving speck out there. A blob now. And\nthen I realized it was not a large object, far away, but small, and\nalready very close--only a few hundred feet off, dropping toward the\ntop of our dome. A narrow, flat, ten foot object, like a wingless\nvolplane. There were no lights on it, but in the Earthlight I could\nsee two crouching, helmeted figures riding it.\n\n\"Anita! Don't you remember!\"\n\nI was swept with dawning comprehension. Back in the Grantline camp\nSnap and I had discussed how to use the _Planetara's_ gravity plates.\nWe had gone to the wreck and secured them, had rigged this little\nvolplane flyer....\n\nThe brigands on the rocks saw it now. A flash went up at it. One of\nthe figures crouching on it opened a flexible fabric like a wing over\nits side. I saw another flash from below, harmlessly striking the\ninsulated shield.\n\nI gasped to Anita, \"Light your helmet! It's from Grantline! Let them\nsee us!\"\n\nI stood erect. The little flying platform went over us, fifty feet up,\ncircling, dropping to the dome top.\n\nI waved my helmet light. The exit lock from below--up which we had\ncome--was near us. The advancing brigands were already in it! I had\nforgotten to demolish the manuals. And I saw that the darkness down on\nthe rocks was almost gone now, dissipating in the airless night. The\nbrigands down there began firing up at us.\n\nIt was a confusion of flashing lights. I clutched at Anita.\n\n\"Come this way--run!\"\n\nThe platform barely missed our heads. It sailed lengthwise of the dome\ntop, and crashed silently on the central runway near the stern tip.\nAnita and I ran to it.\n\nThe two helmeted figures seized us, shoved us prone on the metal\nplatform. It was barely four feet wide; a low railing, handles with\nwhich to cling, and a tiny hooded cubby in front.\n\n\"Gregg!\"\n\n\"You, Snap!\"\n\nIt was Snap and Venza. She seized Anita, held her crouching in place.\nSnap flung himself face down at the controls.\n\nThe brigands were out on the dome now. I took a last shot as we\nlifted. My bullet punctured one of them: he slid, fell scrambling off\nthe rounded dome and dropped out of sight.\n\nLight rays and silent flashes seemed to envelope us. Venza held the\nside shields higher.\n\nWe tilted, swayed crazily, and then steadied.\n\nThe ship's dome dropped away beneath us. The rocks of the open ledge\nwere beneath us. Then the abyss, with the moving, climbing specks of\nMiko's lights far down.\n\nI saw, over the side shield, the already distant brigand ship resting\non the ledge with the massive Archimedes' wall behind it. A confusion\nback there of futile flashing rays.\n\nIt all faded into a remote glow as we sailed smoothly up into the\nstarlight and away, heading for the Grantline camp.\n\n\n\n\nXXXIII\n\n\n\"Wake up. Gregg! They're coming!\"\n\nI forced myself to consciousness. \"Coming--\"\n\nI leaped from my bunk, followed Snap with a rush into the corridor.\n\nWe had returned safely to the Grantline camp. Anita and I found\nourselves exhausted from lack of sleep, our arduous climb of\nArchimedes and that tense time on the brigand ship. On the flight\nback, Snap had explained how the landing of the ship on Archimedes was\nobserved through the Grantline telescope. They had read with amazement\nmy signals to the brigands. Snap had rushed to completion the first of\nour flying platforms. Then he had seen Miko's signals from the crater\nbase, seen the lights and the fight to capture Anita and me, and had\ncome to rescue us.\n\nBack at the camp we were given food, and Grantline forced me to try to\nsleep.\n\n\"They'll be on us in a few hours, Gregg. Miko wall have joined them by\nnow. He'll lead them to us. You must rest, for we need everyone at his\nbest.\"\n\nAnd surprisingly, in the midst of the camp's turmoil of last minute\nactivities, I slept soundly until Snap called me, telling me the ship\nwas coming.\n\nThe corridor echoed with the tramp of Grantline's busy crew. But there\nwas no confusion; a grim calmness had settled on everyone.\n\nAnita and Venza rushed up to join us. \"It's in sight!\"\n\nThere was no need of going to the instrument room. From the windows\nfronting the brink of the cliff the brigand ship was plainly visible.\nIt came sailing from Archimedes, a dark shape blurring the stars. All\nits lights were extinguished save a single white search beam in the\nbow peak, slanting diagonally down.\n\nThe beam presently caught our group of buildings; its glare shone in\nthe windows as it clung for a moment. I could envisage the triumphant\ncuriosity of Potan and his men up there, gazing along the beam.\n\nWe had dimmed the lights to conserve our power, and to enable the\nErentz motors to run at full capacity. Our buildings would have to\nwithstand the brigands' rays which soon would be upon us.\n\nOutside on our dim, Earthlit cliff, the tiny lights showed where our\nfew guards were lurking. As I stood at the window watching the\nincoming ship, Grantline's voice sounded:\n\n\"Call in those men! Ring the call-lights, Franck!\"\n\nThe siren buzzed over the camp's interior; the warning call-lights on\nthe roof brought in the outer guards. They came running to the\nadmission ports, which had been repaired after Miko disabled them.\n\nThe guards came in. We dimmed our lights further. The treasure sheds\nwere black against the cliff behind us. No need for guards there--we\nreasoned the brigands would not attempt to move it until our buildings\nwere captured. But, if they should try it, we were prepared to defend\nit.\n\nIn the dim light we crouched. A silence was upon us save for the\nclanging in the workshop down the corridor. Most of us wore our Erentz\nsuits, with helmets ready, though I am sure there was not a man of us\nbut who prayed he might not have to go out. At many of the\nwindows--our weakest points to withstand the rays--insulated fabric\nsheets were hung like curtains.\n\nThe brigand ship slowly advanced. It was soon over the opposite rim of\nour little crater. Its searchbeam swung about the rim and down the\nvalley.\n\nMy thoughts ran like a turgid stream as I stood tensely watching.\n\nFour hours ago I had sent that flash signal to Earth. If it was\nreceived, a patrol ship could come to our rescue and arrive here in\nanother eight hours--or perhaps even less.\n\nAh, that \"if!\" _If_ the signal was received! _If_ the patrol ship were\nimmediately available. _If_ it started at once....\n\nEight hours at the very least. I tried to assure myself that we could\nhold out that long.\n\nThe brigand ship crossed the opposite crater rim. It dropped lower. It\nseemed poised over the crater valley, almost at our own level and less\nthan two miles from us. Its searchbeam vanished. For a moment it\nhung, a sleek, cylindrical silver shape, gleaming in the Earthlight.\n\nSnap looked at me and murmured, \"It's descending.\"\n\nIt slowly settled, cautiously picked its landing place amid the crags\nand pits of the tumbled, scarred valley floor. It came to rest, a\nvague, menacing silver shape lurking in the lower shadows, close at\nthe foot of the inner opposite crater wall.\n\nA few moments of tense waiting passed. Soon tiny lights were moving\ndown there, some out on the rocks near the ship, others up under its\ndeck dome.\n\nA stab of searchlight shot across the valley, swung along our ledge\nand clung with its glaring ten foot circle to the front of our main\nbuilding. Then a ray flashed.\n\nThe assault had begun!\n\n\n\n\nXXXIV\n\n\nIt seemed, with that first shot from the enemy, that a great relief\ncame to us--an apprehension fallen away. We had anticipated this\nmoment for so long, dreaded it. I think all our men felt it. A shout\nwent up:\n\n\"Harmless!\"\n\nIt was not that. But our building withstood it better than I had\nfeared. It was a flash from a large electronic projector mounted on\nthe deck of the brigand ship. It stabbed up from the shadows across\nthe valley at the foot of the opposite crater wall, a beam of vaguely\nfluorescent light. Simultaneously the searchlight vanished.\n\nThe stream of electrons caught the front face of our main building in\na six foot circle. It held a few seconds, vanished, then stabbed\nagain, and still again. Three bolts. A total, I suppose, of nine or\nten seconds.\n\nI was standing with Grantline at a front window. We had rigged an\noblong of insulated fabric like a curtain; we stood peering, holding\nthe curtain cautiously aside. The ray struck some twenty feet away\nfrom us.\n\n\"Harmless!\" The men shouted it with derision.\n\nBut Grantline swung on them: \"Don't get that idea!\"\n\nAn interior signal panel was beside Grantline. He called the duty men\nin the instrument room.\n\n\"It's over. What are your readings?\"\n\nThe bombarding electrons had passed through the outer shell of the\nbuilding's double wall, and been absorbed in the rarefied, magnetized\naircurrent of the Erentz circulation. Like poison in a man's veins,\nreaching his heart, the free alien electrons had disturbed the motors.\nThey accelerated, then retarded. Pulsed unevenly, and drew added power\nfrom the reserve tanks. But they had normalized at once when the shot\nwas past. The duty man's voice sounded from the grid in answer to\nGrantline's question:\n\n\"Five degrees colder in your building. Can't you feel it?\"\n\nThe disturbed, weakened Erentz system had allowed the outer cold to\nradiate through a trifle. The walls had had a trifle extra explosive\npressure from the air. A strain--but that was all.\n\n\"It's probably their most powerful single weapon, Gregg,\" said\nGrantline.\n\nI nodded, \"Yes, I think so.\"\n\nI had smashed the real giant, with its ten mile range. The ship was\nonly two miles from us, but it seemed as though this projector were\nexerted to its distance limit. I had noticed on the deck only one of\nthis type. The others, paralyzing rays and heat rays, were less\ndeadly.\n\nGrantline commented: \"We can withstand a lot of that bombardment. If\nwe stay inside--\"\n\nThat ray, striking a man outside, would penetrate his Erentz suit\nwithin a few seconds, we could not doubt. We had, however, no\nintention of going out unless for dire necessity.\n\n\"Even so,\" said Grantline, \"a hand shield would hold it off for a\ncertain length of time.\"\n\nWe had an opportunity a moment later to test our insulated shields.\nThe bolt came again. It darted along the front face of the building,\ncaught our window, and clung. The double window shelves were our\nweakest points. The sheet of flashing Erentz current was transparent;\nwe could see through it as though it were glass. It moved faster, but\nwas thinner at the windows than the walls. We feared the bombarding\nelectrons might cross it, penetrate the inner shell and, like a\nlightning bolt, enter the room.\n\nWe dropped the curtain corner. The radiance of the bolt was dimly\nvisible. A few seconds, then it vanished again, and behind the shield\nwe had not felt a tingle.\n\n\"Harmless!\"\n\nBut our power had been drained nearly an aeron, to neutralize the\nshock to the Erentz current. Grantline said:\n\n\"If they kept that up, it would be a question of whose power supply\nwould last longer. And it would not be ours.... You saw our lights\nfade when the bolt was striking?\"\n\nBut the brigands did not know we were short of power. And to fire the\nprojector with a continuous bolt would, in thirty minutes, perhaps,\nhave exhausted their own power reserve.\n\n\"I won't answer them,\" Grantline declared. \"Our game is to sit\ndefensive. Conserve everything. Let them make the leading moves.\"\n\nWe waited half an hour; but no other shot came. The valley floor was\npatched with Earthlight and shadow. We could see the vague outline of\nthe brigand ship backed up at the foot of the opposite crater wall.\nThe form of its dome over the illuminated deck was visible, and the\nline of its tiny hull ovals.\n\nOn the rocks near the ship, helmet lights of prowling brigands\noccasionally showed.\n\nWhatever activity was going on down there we could not see with the\nnaked eye. Grantline did not use our telescope at first. To connect\nit, even for local range, drew on our precious ammunition of power.\nSome of the men urged that we search the sky with the telescope. Was\nour rescue ship from Earth coming? But Grantline refused. We were in\nno trouble yet. And every delay was to our advantage.\n\n\"Commander, where shall I put these helmets?\"\n\nA man came wheeling a pile of helmets on a small truck.\n\n\"At the manual port--in the other building.\"\n\nOur weapons and outside equipment were massed at the main exit locks\nof the large building. But we might want to go out through smaller\nlocks too. Grantline sent helmets there; suits were not needed, as\nmost of us were garbed in them now.\n\nSnap was still in the workshop. I went there during this first\nhalf-hour of the attack. Ten of our men were busy there with the\nlittle flying platforms and the fabric shields.\n\n\"How goes it, Snap?\"\n\n\"Almost all ready.\"\n\nHe had six of the platforms, including the one we had already used,\nand more than a dozen hand shields. At a squeeze, all of us could ride\non these six little vehicles. We might _have_ to ride them! We planned\nthat, in event of disaster to the buildings, we could at least escape\nin this fashion. Food supplies and water were now being placed at the\nports.\n\nDepressing preparations! Our buildings uninhabitable, a rush out and\naway, abandoning the treasure.... Grantline had never mentioned such a\ncontingency, but I noticed, nevertheless, that preparations were being\nmade.\n\nSnap's voice was raised over the clang of the workmen bolting the\ngravity plates of the last platform:\n\n\"Only that one projector, Gregg?\"\n\n\"They gave us four blasts; but just the one projector. Their\nstrongest.\"\n\nHe grinned. He wore no Erentz suit as yet. He stood in torn grimy work\ntrousers and a bedraggled shirt, with the inevitable red eyeshade\nholding back his unruly hair. Around his waist was the weighted belt,\nand there were weights on his shoes for gravity stability.\n\n\"Didn't hurt us much.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"When I get the tube panels in this thing I'll be finished. It'll take\nanother half-hour. Then I'll join you. Where are you stationed?\"\n\nI shrugged. \"I was at a front window with Johnny. Nothing to do as\nyet.\"\n\nSnap went back to his work. \"Well, the longer they delay, the better\nfor us. If only your signal got through, Gregg, we'll have a rescue\nship here in a few hours more!\"\n\nAh, that _if_!\n\nI turned away. \"Can't help you, Snap?\"\n\n\"No.... Take those shields,\" he added to one of the men.\n\n\"Take them where?\"\n\n\"To Grantline. He'll tell you where to put them.\"\n\nThe shields were wheeled away on a little cart. I followed it.\nGrantline sent it to the back exit.\n\n\"No other move from them yet, Johnny?\"\n\n\"No. All quiet.\"\n\n\"Snap's almost finished.\"\n\nThe brigands presently made another play. A giant heat-ray beam came\nacross the valley. It clung to our front wall for nearly a minute.\n\nGrantline got the report from the instrument room. He laughed.\n\n\"That helped rather than hurt us. Heated the outer wall. Franck took\nadvantage of it and eased up the motors.\"\n\nWe wondered if Miko knew that. Doubtless he did, for the heat-ray was\nnot used again.\n\nThen came a zed-ray. I stood at the window, watching it, faint sheen\nof beam in the dimness; it crept with sinister deliberation along our\nfront wall, clung momentarily to our shielded windows, and pried with\nits revealing glow into Snap's workshop.\n\n\"Looking us over,\" Grantline commented. \"I hope they like what they\nsee.\"\n\nI knew that he did not feel the bravado that was in his tone. We had\nnothing but small hand weapons: heat-rays, electronic projectors, and\nbullet projectors. All for very short range fighting. If Miko had not\nknown that before, he could at least make a good guess at it after the\ncareful zed-ray inspection. With his ship down there two miles away,\nwe were powerless to reach him. It seemed that Miko was now testing\nall his mechanisms. A light flare went up from the dome peak of the\nship. It rose in a slow arc over the valley, and burst. For a few\nseconds the two mile circle of crags was brilliantly illumined. I\nstared, but I had to shield my eyes against the dazzling actinic\nglare, and I could see nothing. Was Miko making a zed-ray photograph\nof our interiors? We had no way of knowing.\n\nHe was testing his short range projectors now. With my eyes again\naccustomed to the normal Earthlight in the valley, I could see the\nstabs of electronic beams, the Martian paralyzing rays and heat beams.\nThey darted out like flashing swords from the rocks near the ship.\n\nThen the whole ship and the crater wall behind it seemed to shift\nsidewise as a Benson curve light spread its glow about the ship, with\na projector curve beam coming up and touching the window through which\nI was peering.\n\n\"Haljan, come look at these damn girls! Commander--shall I stop them?\nThey'll kill themselves, or kill us--or smash something!\"\n\nWe followed the man into the building's broad central corridor. Anita\nand Venza were riding a midget platform! Anita, in her boyish black\ngarb; Venza, with a flowing white Venus-robe. They lay on the tiny six\nfoot long oblong of metal, one manipulating its side shields, the\nother at the controls. As we arrived, the platform came sliding down\nthe narrow confines of the corridor, lurching, barely missing a door\nprojection. Up to the low vaulted ceiling, then down to the floor.\n\nIt sailed over our heads, rising over us as we ducked. Anita waved her\nhand.\n\nGrantline gasped, \"By the infernal!\"\n\nI shouted, \"Anita, stop!\"\n\nBut they only waved at us, skimming down the length of the corridor,\nseeming to avoid a smash a dozen times by the smallest margin of\nchance, stopping miraculously at the further end, hanging poised in\nmid-air, wheeling, coming back, undulating up and down.\n\nGrantline clung to me. \"By the gods of the airways!\"\n\nIn spite of my astonished horror, I could not but share Grantline's\nadmiration. Three or four other men were watching. The girls were\namazingly skillful, no doubt of that. There was not a man among us who\ncould have handled that gravity platform indoors, not one who would\nhave had the brash temerity to try it.\n\nThe platform landed with the grace of a humming bird at our feet, the\ngirls dexterously balancing so that it came to rest swiftly, without\nthe least bump.\n\nI confronted them. \"Anita, what are you doing?\"\n\nShe stood up, flushed and smiling. \"Practicing.\"\n\n\"What for?\"\n\nVenza's roguish eyes twinkled at me. Her hands went to her slim hips\nwith a gesture of defiance.\n\nShe asked, \"Are you speaking for yourself or the Commander?\"\n\nI ignored her. \"What for?\"\n\n\"Because we're good at it,\" Anita retorted. \"Better than any of you\nmen. If you should need us, we're ready....\"\n\n\"We won't!\" I said shortly.\n\n\"But if you should....\"\n\nVenza put in, \"If Snap and I hadn't come for you, you wouldn't be\nhere, Gregg Haljan. I didn't notice you were so horrified to see me\nholding that shield up over you!\"\n\nIt silenced me.\n\nShe added, \"Commander, let us alone. We won't smash anything.\"\n\nGrantline laughed. \"I hope you won't!\"\n\nA warning call took us back to the front window. The brigands'\nsearchlight was again being used. It swept slowly along the length of\nthe cliff. Its circle went down the cliff steps to the valley floor,\nand came sweeping up again. Then it went up to the observatory\nplatform at the summit above us, then over to the ore sheds.\n\nWe had no men outside, if that was what the brigands wanted to\ndetermine. The searchbeam presently vanished. It was replaced\nimmediately by a zed-ray, which darted at once to our treasure sheds\nand clung.\n\nThat stung Grantline into his first action. We flung our own zed-ray\ndown across the valley. It reached the brigand ship and the blurred\ninterior of the cabins.\n\n\"Try the searchbeam, Franck.\"\n\nThe zed-ray went off. We gazed down our searchlight which clung to the\ndome of the distant enemy vessel. We could see movement there.\n\n\"The telescope,\" Grantline ordered.\n\nThe dynamos hummed. The telescope finder glowed and clarified. On the\ndeck of the ship we saw the brigands working with the assembling of\ntiny ore carts. A deck landing port was open. The ore carts were being\ncarried out through a port lock and down a landing incline. And on the\nrock outside, we saw several of the carts, tiny rail sections and the\nsection of an ore chute.\n\nMiko was unloading his mining apparatus! He was making ready to come\nup for the treasure!\n\nThe discovery, startling as it was, nevertheless, was far overshadowed\nby an imperative danger alarm from our main building. Brigands were\noutside on our ledge! Miko's searchbeam, sweeping the ledge a moment\nbefore, had carefully avoided revealing them. It had been done just\nfor that purpose, no doubt--to make us feel sure the ledge was\nunoccupied and thus to guard against our own light making the search.\n\nBut there was a brigand group close outside our walls! By the merest\nchance the radiating glow from our searchray had shown the helmeted\nfigures scurrying for shelter.\n\nGrantline leaped to his feet.\n\nWe rushed from the rear port exit which was nearest us. The giant\nbloated figures had been seen running along the outside of the\nconnecting corridor, in this direction. But before we ever got there,\na new alarm came. A brigand was crouching at a front corner of the\nmain building!\n\nHis hydrogen heat torch had already opened a rift in the wall!\n\n\n\n\nXXXV\n\n\n\"In with you!\" ordered Grantline. \"Get your helmets on! How many? Six.\nEnough--get back there, Williams--you were last. The lock won't hold\nany more.\"\n\nI was one of the six who jammed into the manual exit lock. We went\nthrough it; in a moment we were outside. It was less than three\nminutes since the prowling brigand had been seen.\n\nGrantline touched me just as we emerged. \"Don't wait for orders? Get\nhim.\"\n\n\"That fellow with the torch--\"\n\n\"Yes. I'm with you.\"\n\nWe went out with a rush. We had already discarded our shoe and belt\nweights. I leaped, regardless of my companions.\n\nThe scurrying Martians had disappeared. Through my visor bull's-eye I\ncould see only the Earthlit rocky surface of the ledge. Beside me\nstretched the dark wall of our building.\n\nI bounded toward the front. The brigand with the torch had been at the\nfront corner. I could not see him from here; he had been crouching\njust around the angle.\n\nI had a tiny bullet projector, the best weapon for short range\noutdoors. I was aware of Grantline close behind me.\n\nIt took only a few of my giant leaps. I handed at the corner,\nrecovered my balance and whirled around to the front.\n\nThe Martian was here, a giant misshapen lump as he crouched. His torch\nwas a little stab of blue in the deep shadow enveloping him. Intent\nupon his work, he did not see me. Perhaps he thought his fellow men\nhad broken our exits by now.\n\nI landed like a leopard upon his back and fired, my weapon muzzle\nramming him. His torch fell hissing with a silent rain of blue fire\nupon the rocks.\n\nAs my grip upon him made audiphone contact, his agonized scream\nrattled the diaphragms of my ear grids with horrible, deafening\nintensity.\n\nHe lay writhing under me; then was still. His scream choked into\nsilence. His suit deflated within my encircling grip. He was dead: my\nleaden, steel-tipped pellet had punctured the double surface of his\nErentz fabric; penetrated his chest.\n\nGrantline had leaped, landing beside me. \"Dead?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nI climbed from the inert body. The torch had hissed itself out.\nGrantline swung to our building corner, and I leaned down with him to\nexamine it. The torch had fused and scarred the wall, burned almost\nthrough. A pressure rift had opened. We could see it, a curving gash\nin the metal wall-plate like a crack in a glass window pane.\n\nI went cold. This was serious damage. The rarefied Erentz air would\nseep out. It was leaking now: we could see the magnetic radiance of it\nall up the length of the ten foot crack. The leak would change the\npressure of the Erentz system, constantly lower it, demanding steady\nrenewal. The Erentz motors would overheat; some might go bad from the\nstrain.\n\nGrantline stood gripping me. \"Damn bad.\"\n\n\"Yes. Can't we repair it, Johnny?\"\n\n\"No. Would have to take that whole plaster section out, shut off the\nErentz plant and exhaust the interior air of all this bulkhead. Day's\njob--maybe more.\"\n\nAnd the crack would get worse, I knew. It would gradually spread and\nwiden. The Erentz circulation would fail. All our power would be\ndrained struggling to maintain it. This brigand who had unwittingly\ncommitted suicide by his daring act had accomplished more than he had\nperhaps realized. I could envisage our weapons, useless from the lack\nof power. The air in our buildings turned fetid and frigid; ourselves\nforced to the helmets. A rush out to abandon the camp and escape. The\nbuilding exploding, scattering into a litter on the ledge like a\nchild's broken toy. The treasure abandoned, with the brigands coming\nup and loading it on their ship.\n\nOur defeat. In a few hours now--or minutes. This crack could slowly\nwiden, or it could break suddenly at any time. Disaster, come now so\nabruptly upon us at the very start of the brigand attack....\n\nGrantline's voice in my audiphone broke my despairing thoughts.\n\n\"Bad. Come on, Gregg. Nothing to do here.\"\n\nWe were aware that our other four men had run along the building's\nother side. They emerged now--with the running brigands in front of\nthem, rushing out toward the stairs on the ledge. Three giant Martian\nfigures in flight, with our four men chasing.\n\nA brigand fell to the rocks by the brink of the ledge. The others\nreached the descending staircase, tumbled down it with reckless leaps.\n\nOur men turned back. Before we could join them, the enemy ship down in\nthe valley sent up a cautious searchbeam which located its returning\nmen. Then the beam swung up to the ledge, landing upon us.\n\nWe stood confused, blinded by the brilliant glare. Grantline stumbled\nagainst me.\n\n\"Run, Gregg! They'll be firing at us.\"\n\nWe dashed away. Our companions joined us, rushing back for the port. I\nsaw it open, reinforcements coming out to help us--half a dozen\nfigures carrying a ten foot insulated shield. They could barely get it\nthrough the port.\n\nThe Martian searchray vanished. Then almost instantly the electronic\nray came with its deadly stab. Missed us at first, as we ran for the\nshield, carrying it back to the port, hiding behind it.\n\nThe ray stabbed once or twice more.\n\nWhether Miko's instruments showed him how badly damaged our front wall\nwas, we never knew. But I think that he realized. His searchbeam clung\nto it, and his zed-ray pried into our interiors.\n\nThe brigand ship was active now. We were desperate; we used our\ntelescope freely for observation. Miko's ore carts and mining\napparatus were unloaded on the rocks. The rail sections were being\ncarried a mile out, nearly to the center of the valley. A subsidiary\ncamp was being established there, only a mile from the base of our\ncliff, but still far beyond reach of our weapons. We could see the\nbrigand lights down there.\n\nThen the ore chute sections were brought over. We could see Miko's men\ncarrying some of the giant projectors, mounting them in the new\nposition. Power tanks and cables. Light flare catapults--small\nmechanical cannons for throwing illuminating bombs.\n\nThe enemy searchlight constantly raked our vicinity. Occasionally the\ngiant electronic projector flung out its bolt as though warning us not\nto dare leave our buildings.\n\nHalf an hour went by. Our situation was even worse than Miko could\nknow. The Erentz motors were running hot--our power draining, the\ncrack widening. When it would break, we could not tell; but the danger\nwas like a sword over us.\n\nAn anxious thirty minutes for us, this second interlude. Grantline\ncalled a meeting of all our little force, with every man having his\nsay. Inactivity was no longer a feasible policy. We recklessly used\nour power to search the sky. Our rescue ship might be up there; but we\ncould not see it with our now disabled instruments. No signals came.\nWe could not--or, at least, did not--receive them.\n\n\"They wouldn't signal,\" Grantline protested. \"They'd know the\nMartians would be more likely to get the signal than us. Of what use\nto warn Miko?\"\n\nBut he did not dare wait for a rescue ship that might or might not be\ncoming! Miko was playing the waiting game now--making ready for a\nquick loading of the ore when we were forced to abandon our buildings.\n\nThe brigand ship suddenly moved its position! It rose up in a low flat\narc, came forward and settled in the center of the valley where the\ncarts and rail sections were piled, and the outside projectors newly\nmounted on the rocks.\n\nThe brigands now began laying the rails from the ship toward the base\nof our cliff. The chute would bring the ore down from the ledge, and\nthe carts would take it to the ship. The laying of the rails was done\nunder cover of occasional stabs from the electronic projector.\n\nAnd then we discovered that Miko had made still another move. The\nbrigand rays, fired from the depth of the valley, could strike our\nfront building, but could not reach all our ledge. And from the ship's\nnewer and nearer position this disadvantage to us was intensified.\nThen abruptly we realized that under cover of darkness bombs, an\nelectronic projector and searchray had been carried to the top of the\ncrater rim, diagonally across and only half a mile from us. Their\nbeams shot down, raking all our vicinity from this new angle.\n\nI was on the little flying platform which sallied out as a test to\nattack these isolated projectors. Snap and I, and one other volunteer,\nwent. He and I held the shield; Snap handled the controls.\n\nOur exit port was on the lee side of the building from the hostile\nsearchbeam. We got out unobserved and sailed upward; but soon a light\nfrom the ship caught us. And the projector bolts came up....\n\nOur sortie only lasted a few minutes. To me, it was a confusion of\ncrossing beams, with the stars overhead, the swaying little platform\nunder me, and the shield tingling in my hands when the blasts struck\nus. Moments of blurred terror....\n\nThe voice of the man beside me sounded in my ears: \"Now, Haljan, give\nthem one!\"\n\nWe were up over the peak of the rim with the hostile projectors under\nus. I gauged our movement, and dropped an explosive powder bomb.\n\nIt missed. It flared with a puff on the rocks, twenty feet from where\nthe two projectors were mounted. I saw that two helmeted figures were\ndown there. They tried to swing their grids upward, but could not get\nthem vertical to reach us. The ship was firing at us, but it was far\naway. And Grantline's searchbeam was going full power, clinging to the\nship to dazzle them.\n\nSnap circled them. As we came back I dropped another bomb. Its silent\npuff seemed littered with flying fragments of the two projectors and\nthe bodies of the men.\n\nWe swiftly flew back to our base.\n\nIt decided Grantline. For an hour past Snap and I had been urging our\nplan to use the gravity platforms. To remain inactive was sure defeat\nnow. Even if our buildings did not explode--if we thought to huddle in\nthem, helmeted in the failing air--then Miko could readily ignore us\nand proceed with his loading of the treasure under our helpless gaze.\nHe could do that now with safety--if we refused to accept the\nchallenge--for we could not fire through the windows and must go out\nto meet this threat.\n\nTo remain defensive would end inevitably in our defeat. We all knew it\nnow. The waiting game was Miko's--not ours.\n\nThe success of our attack upon the distant isolated projectors,\nheartened us. Yet it was a desperate offensive upon which we decided!\n\nWe prepared our little expedition at the larger of the exit ports.\nMiko's zed-ray was watching all our interior movements. We made a\nbrave show of activity in our workshop with abandoned ore carts which\nwere stored there. We got them out, started to recondition them.\n\nIt seemed to fool Miko. His zed-ray clung to the workshop, watching\nus. And at the distant port we gathered the platforms, shields,\nhelmets, bombs, and a few hand projectors.\n\nThere were six platforms--three of us upon each. It left four people\nto remain indoors.\n\nI need not describe the emotion with which Snap and I listened to\nVenza and Anita pleading to be allowed to accompany us. They urged it\nupon Grantline, and we took no part. It was too important a decision.\nThe treasure--the life or death of all these men--hung now upon the\nfate of our venture. Snap and I could not intrude our personal\nfeelings.\n\nAnd the girls won. Both were undeniably more skillful at handling the\nmidget platforms than any of us men. Two of the six platforms could be\nguided by them. That was a third of our little force! And of what use\nto go out and be defeated, leaving the girls here to meet death almost\nimmediately afterward?\n\nWe gathered at the port. A last minute change made Grantline order six\nof his men to remain to guard the buildings. The instruments, the\nErentz system, all the appliances had to be attended.\n\nIt left four platforms, each with three men--Grantline at the controls\nof one of them. And upon two of the others, Venza rode with Snap and I\nwith Anita.\n\nWe crouched in the shadows outside the port. So small an army,\nsallying out to bomb this enemy vessel or be killed in the attempt!\nOnly sixteen of us. And thirty or so brigands well armed.\n\nI envisioned then this tiny Moon crater, the scene of this battle we\nwere waging. Struggling humans, desperately trying to kill!\n\nAnita drew me down on the platform. \"Ready, Gregg.\"\n\nThe others were rising. We lifted, moved slowly out and away from the\nprotective shadows of the building.\n\n\n\n\nXXXVI\n\n\nGrantline led us. We held about level. Five hundred feet beneath us\nthe brigand ship lay, cradled on the rocks. When it was still a mile\naway from us I could see all its outline fairly clearly in the\ndimness. Its tiny hull windows were dark; but the blurred shape of the\nhull was visible, and above it the rounded cap of dome, with a dim\nradiance beneath it.\n\nWe followed Grantline's platform. It was rising, drawing the others\nafter it like a tail. I touched Anita where she lay beside me with her\nhead half in the small hooded control bank.\n\n\"Going too high.\"\n\nShe nodded, but followed the line nevertheless. It was Grantline's\ncommand.\n\nI lay crouched, holding the inner tips of the flexible side shields.\nThe bottom of the platform was covered with the insulated fabric.\nThere were two side shields. They extended upward some two feet,\nflexible so that I could hold them out to see over them, or draw them\nup and in to cover us.\n\nThey afforded a measure of protection against the hostile rays, though\njust how much we were not sure. With the platform level, a bolt from\nbeneath could not harm us unless it continued for a considerable time.\nBut the platform, except upon direct flight, was seldom level, for it\nwas a frail, unstable little vehicle! To handle it was more than a\nquestion of the controls. We balanced, and helped to guide it with the\nmovement of our bodies--shifting our weight sidewise, or back, or\nforward to make it dip as the controls altered the gravity pull in its\ntiny plate sections.\n\nLike a bird, wheeling, soaring, swooping. To me, it was a precarious\nbusiness.\n\nBut now we were in straight flight diagonally upward. The outline of\nthe brigand ship came directly under us. I crouched tense, breathless;\nevery moment it seemed that the brigands must discover us and loose\ntheir bolts.\n\nThey may have seen us for some moments before they fired. I peered\nover the side shield down at our mark, then up ahead to get\nGrantline's firing signal. It seemed long delayed. An added glow down\nthere must have warned Grantline that a shot was coming from there.\nThe tiny red light flared bright on his platform.\n\nI turned on our Benson curve light radiance. We had been dark, but a\nsoft glow now enveloped us. Its sheen went down to the ship to reveal\nus. But its curving path showed us falsely placed. I saw the little\nline of platforms ahead of us. They seemed to move suddenly sidewise.\n\nIt was everyone for himself now; none of us could tell where the other\nplatforms actually were placed or headed. Anita swooped us sharply\ndown to avoid a possible collision.\n\n\"Gregg?\"\n\n\"Yes. I'm aiming.\"\n\nI was making ready to drop the small explosive globe bomb. Our search\nlight ray at the camp, answering Grantline's signal, shot down and\nbathed the enemy ship in a white glare, revealing it for our aim.\nSimultaneously the brigand bolts came up at us.\n\nI held my bomb out over the shield, calculating the angle to throw it\ndown. The brigand rays flashed around me. They were horribly close;\nMiko had understood our sudden visible shift and aimed, not where we\nappeared to be, but approximately where we had been before.\n\nI dropped my bomb hastily at the glowing white ship. The touch of a\nhostile ray would have exploded it in my hand. I saw others dropping\nalso from our nearby platforms. The explosions from them merged in a\nconfusion of the white glare--and a cloud of black mist as the\nbrigands out on the rocks used their darkness bombs.\n\nWe swept past in a blur of leaping hostile beams. Silent battle of\nlights! Darkness bombs down at the ship struggling to bar our camp\nsearchray. The Benson radiance rays from our passing platforms,\ncurving down to mingle with the confusion. The electronic rays\nsending up their bolts....\n\nOur platforms dropped some ten dynamitrine bombs in that first passage\nover the ship. As we sped by, I dimmed the Benson radiance. I peered.\nWe had not hit the ship. Or if we had, the damage was inconclusive.\nBut on the rocks I could see a pile of ore carts scattered--broken\nwreckage, in which the litter of two or three projectors seemed\nstrewn. And the gruesome deflated forms of several helmeted figures.\nOthers seemed to be running, scattering--hiding in the rocks and\npit-holes. Twenty brigands at least were outside the ship. Some were\nrunning over toward the base of our camp ledge. The darkness bombs\nwere spreading like a curtain over the valley floor; but it seemed\nthat some of the figures were dragging their projectors away.\n\nWe sailed off toward the opposite crater rim. I remember passing over\nthe broken wreckage of Grantline's little spaceship, the _Comet_.\nMiko's bolts momentarily had vanished. We had hit some of his outside\nprojectors; the others were abandoned, or being dragged to safer\npositions.\n\nAfter a mile we wheeled and went back. I suddenly realized that only\nfour platforms were in the re-formed line ahead of us. One was\nmissing! I saw it now, wavering down, close over the ship. A bolt\nleaped up diagonally from a distant angle on the rocks and caught the\ndisabled platform. It fell, whirling, glowing red--disappeared into\nthe blur of darkness like a bit of heated metal plunged into water.\n\nOne out of six of our platforms already lost! Three men of our small\nforce gone!\n\nBut Grantline led us desperately back. Anita caught his signal to\nbreak our line. The five platforms scattered, dipping and wheeling\nlike frightened birds--blurring shapes, shifting unnaturally in flight\nas the Benson curve lights were altered.\n\nAnita now took our platform in a long swoop downward. Her tense,\nmurmured voice sounded in my ears:\n\n\"Hold off; I'll take us low.\"\n\nA melee. Passing platform shapes. The darting bolts, crossing like\nancient rapiers. Falling blue points of fuse lights as we threw our\nbombs.\n\nDown in a swoop. Then rising. Away, and then back. This silent warfare\nof lights! It seemed that around me must be bursting a pandemonium of\nsound. Yet there was none. Silent, blurred melee, infinitely\nfrightening. A bolt struck us, clung for an instant; but we weathered\nit. The light was blinding. Through my gloves I could feel the tingle\nof the over charged shield as it caught and absorbed the hostile\nbombardment. Under me the platform seemed heated. My little Erentz\nmotors ran with ragged pulse. I got too much oxygen. I was dully\nsmothering....\n\nThen the bolt was gone. I found us soaring upward, horribly tilted. I\nshifted over.\n\n\"Anita! Anita, dear, are you all right?\"\n\n\"Yes, Gregg. All right.\"\n\nThe melee went on. The brigand ship and all its vicinity were\nenveloped in dark mist now--a turgid sable curtain, made more dense by\nthe dissipating heavy fumes of our exploding bombs which settled low\nover the ship and the rocks nearby. The searchlight from our camp\nstrove futilely to penetrate the cloud.\n\nOur platforms were separated. One went by, high over us. I saw another\ndart close beneath my shield.\n\n\"God, Anita!\"\n\n\"Too close! I didn't see it.\"\n\nAlmost a collision.\n\n\"Gregg, haven't we broken the ship's dome yet?\"\n\nIt seemed not. I had dropped nearly all my bombs. This could not go on\nmuch longer. Had it been only about five minutes? Only that? Reason\ntold me so, yet it seemed an eternity of horror.\n\nAnother swoop. My last bomb. Anita had brought us into position to\nfling it. But I could not. A bolt stabbed up from the gloom and caught\nus. We huddled, pulling the shields up and over us.\n\nBlurred darkness again. Too much to the side now. I had to wait while\nAnita swung us back. Then we seemed too high.\n\nI waited with my last bomb. The other platforms were occasionally\ndropping them: I had been too hasty, too prodigal.\n\nHad we broken the ship's dome with a direct hit? It seemed not.\n\nThe brigands were sending up catapulted light flares. They came from\npositions on the rocks outside the ship. They mounted in lazy curves\nand burst over us. The concealing darkness, broken only by the flares\nof explosions, enveloped the enemy. Our camp searchlight was still\nstruggling with it. But overhead, where the few little platforms were\ncircling and swooping, the flares gave an almost continuous glare. It\nwas dazzling, blinding. Even through the smoked pane which I adjusted\nto my visor I could not stand it.\n\nBut these were thoughts of comparative dimness. In a patch where the\nEarthlight struck through the darkness of the rocks, I saw another of\nour fallen platforms! Snap and Venza?\n\nIt was not they, but three figures of our men. One was dead. Two had\nsurvived the fall. They stood up, staggering. And in that instant,\nbefore the turgid black curtain closed over them, I saw two brigands\ncome rushing. Their hand projectors stabbed at close range. Our men\ncrumpled and fell....\n\nWe were in position again. I flung my last missile, watched its light\nas it dropped. On the dome roof two of Miko's men were crouching. My\nbomb was truly aimed--perhaps one of the few in all our bombardment\nwhich landed directly on the dome roof. But the waiting marksmen fired\nat it with short range heat projectors and exploded it harmlessly\nwhile it was still above them.\n\nWe swung up and away. I saw, high above us, Grantline's platform,\nrecognizing its red signal light. There seemed a lull. The enemy fire\nhad died down to only a very occasional bolt. In the confusion of my\nwhirling impressions, I wondered if Miko were in distress. Not that!\nWe had not hit his ship; perhaps we had done little damage indeed! It\nwas we who were in distress. Two of our platforms had fallen--two out\nof six. Or more, of which I did not know.\n\nI saw one rising off to the side of us. Grantline was over us. Well,\nwe were at least three. And then I saw the fourth.\n\n\"Grantline is calling us up, Gregg.\"\n\nGrantline's signal light was summoning us from the attack. He was a\nthousand feet or more above us.\n\nI was suddenly shocked with horror. The searchray from our camp\nsuddenly vanished! Anita wheeled us to face the distant ledge. The\ncamp lights showed, and over one of the buildings was a distress\nlight!\n\nHad the crack in our front wall broken, threatening explosion of all\nthe buildings? The wild thought swept me. But it was not that. I could\nsee light stabs from the cliff outside the main building. Miko had\ndared to send some men to attack our almost deserted camp!\n\nGrantline realized it. His red helmet light semaphored the command to\nfollow him. His platform soared away, heading for the camp, with the\nother two behind him.\n\nAnita lifted us to follow. But I checked her.\n\n\"No! Off to the right, across the valley.\"\n\n\"But Gregg!\"\n\n\"Do as I say, Anita.\"\n\nShe swung us diagonally away from both the camp and the brigand ship.\nI prayed that we might not be noticed by the brigands.\n\n\"Anita, listen: I've got an idea!\"\n\nThe attack on the brigand ship was over. It lay enveloped in the\ndarkness of the powder gas cloud and its own darkness bombs. But it\nwas uninjured.\n\nMiko had answered us with our own tactics. He had practically unmanned\nthe ship, no doubt, and had sent his men to our buildings. The fight\nhad shifted. But I was now without ammunition, save for two or three\nbullet projectors.\n\nOf what use for our platform to rush back? Miko expected that. His\nattack on the camp was undoubtedly made just for that purpose: to lure\nus back there.\n\n\"Anita, if we can get down on the rocks somewhere near the ship, and\ncreep up unobserved in that blackness....\"\n\nI might be able to reach the manual hull lock, rip it open and let the\nair out. If I could get into its pressure chamber and unseal the inner\nslide....\n\n\"It would wreck the ship, Anita: exhaust all its air. Shall we try\nit?\"\n\n\"Whatever you say, Gregg.\"\n\nWe seemed to be unobserved. We skimmed close to the valley floor, a\nmile from the ship. We headed slowly toward it, sailing low over the\nrocks.\n\nThen we landed, left the platform. \"Let me go first, Anita.\"\n\nI held a bullet projector. With slow, cautious leaps, we advanced.\nAnita was behind me. I had wanted to leave her with the platform, but\nshe would not stay. And to be with me seemed at least equally safe.\n\nThe rocks were deserted. I thought that there was very little chance\nthat any of the enemy would lurk here. We clambered over the pitted,\nscarred surface; the higher crags, etched with Earthlight, stood like\nsentinels in the gloom.\n\nThe brigand ship with its surrounding darkness was not far from us. No\none was out here. We passed the wreckage of broken projectors, and\ngruesome, shattered human forms.\n\nWe prowled closer. The hull of the ship loomed ahead of us. All dark.\n\nWe came at last close against the sleek metal hull side, slid along it\nto where I was sure the manual lock would be located.\n\nAbruptly I realized that Anita was not behind me! Then I saw her at a\nlittle distance, struggling in the grip of a giant helmeted figure!\nThe brigand lifted her--turned, and ran.\n\nI did not dare fire. I bounded after them along the hull-side, around\nunder the curve of the pointed bow, down along the other side.\n\nI had mistaken the hull port location. It was here. The running,\nbounding figure reached it, slid the panel. I was only fifty feet\naway--not much more than a single leap. I saw Anita being shoved into\nthe pressure lock. The Martian flung himself after her.\n\nI fired at him in desperation, but missed. I came with a rush. And as\nI reached the port, it slid closed in my face, barring me!\n\n\n\n\nXXXVII\n\n\nWith puny fists I pounded the panel. A small pane in it was\ntransparent. Within the lock I could see the blurred figures of Anita\nand her captor--and it seemed, another figure there. The lock was some\nten feet square, with a low ceiling. It glowed with a dim tube-light.\n\nI strained at it with futile, silent effort. The mechanism was here to\nopen this manual; but it was now clasped from within so would not\noperate.\n\nA few seconds, while I stood there in a panic of confusion, raging to\nget in. This disaster had come so suddenly. I did not plan: I had no\nthought save to batter my way in and rescue Anita. I recall that I\nfinally beat on the glassite pane with my bullet projector until the\nweapon was bent and useless. And I flung it with a wild despairing\nrage at my feet.\n\nThey were letting the ship's air-pressure into this lock. Soon they\nwould open the inner panel, step into the secondary chamber--and in a\nmoment more would be within the ship's hull corridor. Anita, lost to\nme!\n\nThe outer panel suddenly opened! I had lunged against it with my\nshoulder; the giant figure inside slid it. It was taken by surprise! I\nhalf fell forward.\n\nHuge arms went around me. The goggled face of the helmet peered into\nmine.\n\n\"So it is you, Haljan! I thought I recognized that little device over\nyour helmet bracket. And here is my little Anita, come back to me\nagain!\"\n\nMiko!\n\nThis was he. His great bloated arms encircling me, bending me\nbackward, holding me helpless. I saw over his shoulder that Anita was\nclutched in the grip of another helmeted figure. No giant, but tall\nfor an Earth man--almost as tall as myself. Then the tube light in the\nroom illumined the visor. I saw the face, recognized it. Moa!\n\nI gasped, \"So--I've got you--Miko--\"\n\n\"Got me! You're a fool to the last, Haljan! A fool to the last! But\nyou were always a fool.\"\n\nI could scarcely move in his grip. My arms were pinned. As he slowly\nbent me backward, I wound my legs around one of his: it was as\nunyielding as a steel pillar. He had closed the outer panel; the air\npressure in the lock was rising. I could feel it against my suit.\n\nMy helmeted head was being forced backward; Miko's left arm held me.\nIn his gloved right hand as it came slowly up over my throat I saw a\nknife blade, its naked, sharpened metal glistening blue-white in the\nlight from overhead.\n\nI seized his wrist. But my puny strength could not hold him. The\nknife, against all of my efforts, came slowly down.\n\nA moment of this slow, deadly combat--the end of everything for me.\n\nI was aware of the helmeted figure of Moa casting off Anita--and then\nthe two girls leaping upon Miko. It threw him off his balance, and my\nhanging weight made him topple forward. He took a step to recover\nhimself; his hand with the knife was flung up with an instinctive,\ninvoluntary balancing gesture. And as it came down again, I forced the\nknife-blade to graze his throat. Its point caught in the fabric of his\nsuit.\n\nHis startled oath jangled in my ears. The girls were clawing at him;\nwe were all four scrambling, swaying. With despairing strength I\ntwisted at his wrist. The knife went into his throat. I plunged it\ndeeper.\n\nHis suit went flabby. He crumpled over me and fell, knocking me to the\nfloor. His voice, with the horrible gurgling rasp of death in it,\nrattled my ear-grids.\n\n\"Not such a fool--are you, Haljan--\"\n\nMoa's helmeted head was close over us. I saw that she had seized the\nknife, jerked it from her brother's throat. She leaped backward,\nwaving it.\n\nI twisted from beneath Miko's lifeless, inert body. As I got to my\nfeet, Anita flung herself to shield me. Moa was across the lock, back\nup against the wall. The knife in her hand went up. She stood for the\nbriefest instant regarding Anita and me, holding each other. I thought\nthat she was about to leap upon us. But before I could move, the knife\ncame down and plunged into her breast. She fell forward, her grotesque\nhelmet striking the grid-floor almost at my feet.\n\n\"Gregg!\"\n\n\"She's dead.\"\n\n\"No! She moved! Get her helmet off! There's enough air here.\"\n\nMy helmet pressure indicator was faintly buzzing to show that a safe\npressure was in the room. I shut off Moa's Erentz motors, unfastened\nher helmet and raised it off. We gently turned her body. She lay with\nclosed eyes, her pallid face blue. With our own helmets off, we knelt\nover her.\n\n\"Oh, Gregg--is she dead?\"\n\n\"No. Not quite--but dying.\"\n\n\"Gregg, I don't want her to die! She was trying to help you there at\nthe last.\"\n\nShe opened her eyes. The film of death was glazing them. But she saw\nme, recognized me.\n\n\"Gregg--\"\n\n\"Yes, Moa. I'm here.\"\n\nHer vivid lips were faintly drawn in a smile. \"I'm--so glad--you took\nthe helmets off, Gregg. I'm--going--you know.\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"Going--back to Mars--to rest with the fire-makers--where I came\nfrom. I was thinking--maybe you would kiss me, Gregg?\"\n\nAnita gently pushed me down. I pressed the white, faintly smiling lips\nwith mine. She sighed, and it ended with a rattle in her throat.\n\n\"Thank you--Gregg--closer--I can't talk so loudly--\"\n\nOne of her gloved hands struggled to touch me, but she had no strength\nand it fell back. Her words were the faintest of whispers:\n\n\"There was no use living--without your love. But I want you to\nsee--now--that a Martian girl can die with a smile--\"\n\nHer eyelids fluttered down; it seemed that she sighed and then was not\nbreathing. But on her livid face the faint smile still lingered, to\nshow me how a Martian girl could die.\n\nWe had forgotten for the moment where we were. As I glanced up I saw\nthrough the inner panel, past the secondary lock, that the hull's\ncorridor was visible. And along its length a group of Martians was\nadvancing! They saw us, and came running.\n\n\"Anita! Look! We've got to get out of here!\"\n\nThe secondary lock was open to the corridor. We jammed on our helmets.\nThe unhelmeted brigands by then were fumbling at the inner panel. I\npulled at the lever of the outer panel. The brigands were hurrying,\nthinking that they could be in time to stop me. One of the more\ncautious fumbled with a helmet.\n\n\"Anita, run! Try and keep your feet.\"\n\nI slid the outer panel and pushed at Anita. Simultaneously the\nbrigands opened the inner port.\n\nThe air came with a tempestuous rush. A blast through the inner\nport--through the small pressure lock--a wild rush, out to the airless\nMoon. All the air in the ship madly rushing to escape....\n\nLike feathers, we were blown with it. I recall an impression of the\nhurtling brigand figures and swift flying rocks under me. A silent\ncrash as I struck.\n\nThen soundless, empty blackness.\n\n\n\n\nXXXVIII\n\n\n\"Is he conscious? We'd better take him back: get his helmet off.\"\n\n\"It's over. We can get back to the camp now. Venza dear, we've\nwon--it's over.\"\n\n\"He hears us!\"\n\n\"Gregg!\"\n\n\"He hears us. He'll be all right!\"\n\nI opened my eyes, I lay on the rocks. Over my helmet, other helmets\nwere peering, and faint, familiar voices mingled with the roaring in\nmy ears.\n\n\"--back to the camp and get his helmet off.\"\n\n\"Are his motors smooth? Keep them right, Snap--he must have good air.\"\n\nI seemed unhurt. But Anita....\n\nShe was here. \"Gregg, dear one!\"\n\nAnita safe! All four of us here on the Earthlit rocks, close outside\nthe brigand ship.\n\n\"Anita!\"\n\nShe held me, lifted me. I was uninjured. I could stand: I staggered up\nand stood swaying. The brigand ship, a hundred feet away, loomed dark\nand silent, a lifeless hulk, already empty of air, drained in the mad\nblast outward. Like the wreck of the _Planetara_--a dead, useless,\npulseless hulk already.\n\nWe four stood together, triumphant. The battle was over. The brigands\nwere worsted, almost the last man of them dead or dying. No more than\nten or fifteen had been available for that final assault upon the camp\nbuildings. Miko's last strategy. I think perhaps he had intended, with\nhis few remaining men, to take the ship and make away, deserting his\nfellows.\n\nAll on the ship, caught unhelmeted by the explosion, were dead long\nsince.\n\nI stood listening to Snap's triumphant account. It had not been\ndifficult for the flying platforms to hunt down the attacking brigands\non the open rocks. We had only lost one more platform.\n\nHuman hearts beat sometimes with very selfish emotions. It was a\ntriumphant ending for us, and we hardly gave a thought that half of\nGrantline's men had perished.\n\nWe huddled on Snap's platform. It rose, lurching drunkenly barely\ncarrying us.\n\nAs we headed for the Grantline buildings, where still the rift in the\nwall had not quite broken, there came the final triumph. Miko had been\naware of it, and knew he had lost. Grantline's searchlight leaped\nupward, swept the sky, caught its sought-for object--a huge silver\ncylinder, bathed brightly in the white searchbeam glare.\n\nThe police ship from Earth.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nTWO PLANETS CLASH FOR LUNAR TREASURE\n\n\nGregg Haljan was aware that there was a certain danger in having the\ngiant spaceship _Planetara_ stop off at the moon to pick up\nGrantline's special cargo of moon ore. For that rare metal--invaluable\nin keeping Earth's technology running--was the target of many greedy\neyes.\n\nBut nevertheless he hadn't figured on the special twist the clever\nMartian brigands would use. So when he found both the ship and himself\nsuddenly in their hands, he knew that there was only one way in which\nhe could hope to save that cargo and his own secret--that would be by\nturning space-pirate himself and paying the BRIGANDS OF THE MOON back\nin their own interplanetary coin.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHere is a science-fiction classic, as exciting and ingenious as only a\nmaster of super-science could write.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen RAY CUMMINGS took leave of this planet early in 1957, the world\nof modern science-fiction lost one of its genuine founding fathers.\nFor the imagination of this talented writer supplied a great many of\nthe most basic themes upon which the present superstructure of\nscience-fiction is based. Following the lead of Jules Verne and H. G.\nWells, Cummings successfully bridged the gap between the early dawning\nof science-fiction in the last decades of the Nineteenth Century and\nthe full flowering of the field in these middle decades of the\nTwentieth.\n\nBorn in 1887, Cummings acquired insight into the vast possibilities of\nfuture science by a personal association with Thomas Alva Edison.\nDuring the 1920's and 1930's, he thrilled millions of readers with his\nvivid tales of space and time. The infinite and the infinitesimal were\nall parts of his canvas, and past, present, and future, the\ninterplanetary and the extra-dimensional, all made their initial\nimpact on the reading public through his many stories and novels.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPreviously published in an ACE edition is his novel,\n_The Man Who Mastered Time_ (D-173).\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Brigands of the Moon, by Ray Cummings\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK BRIGANDS OF THE MOON ***\n\n***** This file should be named 19066-8.txt or 19066-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/9/0/6/19066/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Jason Isbell, Sankar Viswanathan,\nand the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at\nhttp://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n*** END: FULL LICENSE ***\n"}
