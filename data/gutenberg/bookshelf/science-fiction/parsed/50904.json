F. BONE\n\n                         Illustrated by FINLAY\n\n           [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n                      Galaxy Magazine April 1963.\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\n\n\n\n      To Kworn the object was a roadblock, threatening his life.\n         But it was also a high road to a magnificent future!\n\n\nThe Ul Kworn paused in his search for food, extended his eye and\nconsidered the thing that blocked his path.\n\nHe hadn't notice the obstacle until he had almost touched it. His\nattention had been focused upon gleaning every feeder large enough to\nbe edible from the lichens that covered his feeding strip. But the\nunexpected warmth radiating from the object had startled him. Sundown\nwas at hand. There should be nothing living or non-living that radiated\na fraction of the heat that was coming from the gleaming metal wall\nwhich lay before him. He expanded his mantle to trap the warmth as he\npushed his eye upward to look over the top. It wasn't high, just high\nenough to be a nuisance. It curved away from him toward the boundaries\nof his strip, extending completely across the width of his land.\n\nA dim racial memory told him that this was an artefact, a product of\nthe days when the Folk had leisure to dream and time to build. It had\nprobably been built by his remote ancestors millennia ago and had just\nrecently been uncovered from its hiding place beneath the sand. These\nmetal objects kept appearing and disappearing as the sands shifted\nto the force of the wind. He had seen them before, but never a piece\nso large or so well preserved. It shone as though it had been made\nyesterday, gleaming with a soft silvery luster against the blue-black\ndarkness of the sky.\n\nAs his eye cleared the top of the wall, he quivered with shock and\nastonishment. For it was not a wall as he had thought. Instead, it was\nthe edge of a huge metal disc fifty raads in diameter. And that wasn't\nall of it. Three thick columns of metal extended upward from the disc,\nleaning inward as they rose into the sky. High overhead, almost beyond\nthe range of accurate vision, they converged to support an immense\ncylinder set vertically to the ground. The cylinder was almost as great\nin diameter as the disc upon which his eye first rested. It loomed\noverhead, and he had a queasy feeling that it was about to fall and\ncrush him. Strange jointed excresences studded its surface, and in its\nside, some two-thirds of the way up, two smaller cylinders projected\nfrom the bigger one. They were set a little distance apart, divided by\na vertical row of four black designs, and pointed straight down his\nfeeding strip.\n\nThe Ul Kworn eyed the giant structure with disgust and puzzlement.\nThe storm that had uncovered it must have been a great one to have\nblown so much sand away. It was just his fortune to have the thing\nsquatting in his path! His mantle darkened with anger. Why was it that\neverything happened to him? Why couldn't it have lain in someone else's\nway, upon the land of one of his neighbors? It blocked him from nearly\nthree thousand square raads of life-sustaining soil. To cross it would\nrequire energy he could not spare. Why couldn't it have been on the Ul\nCaada's or the Ul Varsi's strip--or any other of the numberless Folk?\nWhy did he have to be faced with this roadblock?\n\nHe couldn't go around it since it extended beyond his territory and,\ntherefore, he'd have to waste precious energy propelling his mass up\nthe wall and across the smooth shining surface of the disc--all of\nwhich would have to be done without food, since his eye could see no\nlichen growing upon the shiny metal surface.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe chill of evening had settled on the land. Most of the Folk were\nalready wrapped in their mantles, conserving their energy until the\ndawn would warm them into life. But Kworn felt no need to estivate. It\nwas warm enough beside the wall.\n\nThe air shimmered as it cooled. Microcrystals of ice formed upon the\nlegs of the structure, outlining them in shimmering contrast to the\ndrab shadowy landscape, with its gray-green cover of lichens stippled\nwith the purple balls of the lichen feeders that clung to them. Beyond\nKworn and his neighbors, spaced twenty raads apart, the mantled\nbodies of the Folk stretched in a long single line across the rolling\nlandscape, vanishing into the darkness. Behind this line, a day's\ntravel to the rear, another line of the Folk was following. Behind them\nwas yet another. There were none ahead, for the Ul Kworn and the other\nUl were the elders of the Folk and moved along in the first rank where\ntheir maturity and ability to reproduce had placed them according to\nthe Law.\n\nCaada and Varsi stirred restlessly, stimulated to movement by the heat\nradiating from the obstacle, but compelled by the Law to hold their\nplace in the ranks until the sun's return would stimulate the others.\nTheir dark crimson mantles rippled over the soil as they sent restless\npseudopods to the boundaries of their strips.\n\nThey were anxious in their attempt to communicate with the Ul Kworn.\n\nBut Kworn wasn't ready to communicate. He held aloof as he sent a\nthin pseudopod out toward the gleaming wall in front of him. He was\nsquandering energy; but he reasoned that he had better learn all\nhe could about this thing before he attempted to cross it tomorrow,\nregardless of what it cost.\n\nIt was obvious that he would have to cross it, for the Law was specific\nabout encroachment upon a neighbor's territory. _No member of the Folk\nshall trespass the feeding land of another during the Time of Travel\nexcept with published permission. Trespass shall be punished by the\nejection of the offender from his place in rank._\n\nAnd that was equivalent to a death sentence.\n\nHe could ask Caada or Varsi for permission, but he was virtually\ncertain that he wouldn't get it. He wasn't on particularly good terms\nwith his neighbors. Caada was querulous, old and selfish. He had not\nreproduced this season and his vitality was low. He was forever hungry\nand not averse to slipping a sly pseudopod across the boundaries of his\nland to poach upon that of his neighbor. Kworn had warned him some time\nago that he would not tolerate encroachment and would call for a group\njudgment if there was any poaching. And since the Folk were physically\nincapable of lying to one another, Caada would be banished. After that\nCaada kept his peace, but his dislike for Kworn was always evident.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut Varsi who held the land on Kworn's right was worse. He had advanced\nto Ul status only a year ago. At that time there had been rumors among\nthe Folk about illicit feeding and stealing of germ plasm from the\nsmaller and weaker members of the race. But that could not be proved,\nand many young Folk died in the grim process of growing to maturity.\nKworn shrugged. If Varsi was an example of the younger generation,\nsociety was heading hell-bent toward Emptiness. He had no love for\nthe pushing, aggressive youngster who crowded out to the very borders\nof his domain, pressing against his neighbors, alert and aggressive\ntoward the slightest accidental spillover into his territory. What\nwas worse, Varsi had reproduced successfully this year and thus had\nrejuvenated. Kworn's own attempt had been only partially successful.\nHis energy reserves hadn't been great enough to produce a viable\noffspring, and the rejuvenation process in his body had only gone to\npartial completion. It would be enough to get him to the winter feeding\ngrounds. But as insurance he had taken a place beside Caada, who was\ncertain to go into Emptiness if the feeding en route was bad.\n\nStill, he hadn't figured that he would have Varsi beside him.\n\nHe consoled himself with the thought that others might have as bad\nneighbors as he. But he would never make the ultimate mistake of\nexchanging germ plasm with either of his neighbors, not even if his\nfertility and his position depended upon it. Cells like theirs would\ndo nothing to improve the sense of discipline and order he had so\ncarefully developed in his own. His offspring were courteous and\nhonorable, a credit to the Folk and to the name of Kworn. A father\nshould be proud of his offspring, so that when they developed to the\npoint where they could have descendants, he would not be ashamed of\nwhat they would produce. An Ul, Kworn thought grimly, should have some\nsense of responsibility toward the all-important future of the race.\n\nHis anger died as he exerted synergic control. Anger was a waster of\nenergy, a luxury he couldn't afford. He had little enough as it was. It\nhad been a bad year. Spring was late, and winter had come early. The\nsummer had been dry and the lichens in the feeding grounds had grown\npoorly. The tiny, bulbous lichen feeders, the main source of food for\nthe Folk, had failed to ripen to their usual succulent fullness. They\nhad been poor, shrunken things, hardly worth ingesting. And those along\nthe route to the winter feeding grounds were no better.\n\nGlumly he touched the wall before him with a tactile filament. It\nwas uncomfortably warm, smooth and slippery to the touch. He felt it\ndelicately, noting the almost microscopic horizontal ridges on the\nwall's surface. He palpated with relief. The thing was climbable. But\neven as he relaxed, he recoiled, the filament writhing in agony! The\nwall had burned his flesh! Faint threads of vapor rose from where he\nhad touched the metal, freezing instantly in the chill air. He pinched\noff the filament in an automatic protective constriction of his cells.\nThe pain ceased instantly, but the burning memory was so poignant that\nhis mantle twitched and shuddered convulsively for some time before the\nreflexes died.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThoughtfully he ingested his severed member. With a sense of numbing\nshock he realized that he would be unable to pass across the disc. The\nimplications chilled him. If he could not pass, his land beyond the\nroadblock would be vacant and open to preemption by his neighbors. Nor\ncould he wait until they had passed and rejoin them later. The Law was\nspecific on that point. _If one of the Folk lags behind in his rank,\nhis land becomes vacant and open to his neighbors. Nor can one who has\nlagged behind reclaim his land by moving forward. He who abandons his\nposition, abandons it permanently._\n\nWryly, he reflected that it was this very Law that had impelled him to\ntake a position beside the Ul Caada. And, of course, his neighbors knew\nthe Law as well as he. It was a part of them, a part of their cells\neven before they split off from their parent. It would be the acme of\nfolly to expect that neighbors like Varsi or Caada would allow him to\npass over their land and hold his place in rank.\n\nBitterness flooded him with a stimulation so piercing that Caada\nextended a communication filament to project a question. \"What is this\nthing which lies upon your land and mine?\" Caada asked. His projection\nwas weak and feeble. It was obvious that he would not last for many\nmore days unless feeding improved.\n\n\"I do not know. It is something of metal, and it bars my land. I cannot\ncross it. It burns me when I touch it.\"\n\nA quick twinge of excitement rushed along Caada's filament. The old Ul\nbroke the connection instantly, but not before Kworn read the flash of\nhope that Kworn had kindled. There was no help in this quarter, and\nthe wild greed of Varsi was so well known that there was no sense even\ntrying that side.\n\nA surge of hopelessness swept through him. Unless he could find some\nway to pass this barrier he was doomed.\n\nHe didn't want to pass into Emptiness. He had seen too many others go\nthat way to want to follow them. For a moment he thought desperately\nof begging Caada and Varsi for permission to cross into their land for\nthe short time that would be necessary to pass the barrier, but reason\nasserted itself. Such an act was certain to draw a flat refusal and,\nafter all, he was the Ul Kworn and he had his pride. He would not beg\nwhen begging was useless.\n\nAnd there was a bare possibility that he might survive if he closed his\nmantle tightly about him and waited until all the ranks had passed. He\ncould then bring up the rear ... and, possibly, just possibly, there\nwould be sufficient food left to enable him to reach the winter feeding\ngrounds.\n\nAnd it might still be possible to cross the disc. There was enough\nwarmth in it to keep him active. By working all night he might be able\nto build a path of sand across its surface and thus keep his tissues\nfrom being seared by the metal. He would be technically violating the\nlaw by moving ahead of the others, but if he did not feed ahead, no\nharm would be done.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe moved closer to the barrier and began to pile sand against its base,\nsloping it to make a broad ramp to the top of the disc. The work was\nslow and the sand was slippery. The polished grains slipped away and\nthe ramp crumbled time after time. But he worked on, piling up sand\nuntil it reached the top of the disc. He looked across the flat surface\nthat stretched before him.\n\nFifty raads!\n\nIt might as well be fifty zets. He couldn't do it. Already his energy\nlevel was so low that he could hardly move, and to build a raad-wide\npath across this expanse of metal was a task beyond his strength. He\ndrooped across the ramp, utterly exhausted. It was no use. What he\nought to do was open his mantle to Emptiness.\n\nHe hadn't felt the communication filaments of Caada and Varsi touch\nhim. He had been too busy, but now with Caada's burst of glee, and\nVarsi's cynical, \"A noble decision, Ul Kworn. You should be commended,\"\nhe realized that they knew everything.\n\nHis body rippled hopelessly. He was tired, too tired for anger. His\nenergy was low. He contemplated Emptiness impassively. Sooner or later\nit came to all Folk. He had lived longer than most, and perhaps it\nwas his time to go. He was finished. He accepted the fact with a cold\nfatalism that he never dreamed he possessed. Lying there on the sand,\nhis mantle spread wide, he waited for the end to come.\n\nIt wouldn't come quickly, he thought. He was still far from the\ncellular disorganization that preceded extinction. He was merely\nexhausted, and in need of food to restore his energy.\n\nWith food he might still have an outside chance of building the path in\ntime. But there was no food. He had gleaned his area completely before\nhe had ever reached the roadblock.\n\nLying limp and relaxed on the ramp beside the barrier, he slowly became\nconscious that the metal wasn't dead. It was alive! Rhythmic vibrations\npassed through it and were transmitted to his body by the sand.\n\nA wild hope stirred within him. If the metal were alive it might hear\nhim if he tried to communicate. He concentrated his remaining reserves\nof energy, steeled himself against the pain and pressed a communication\nfilament against the metal.\n\n\"Help me!\" he projected desperately. \"You're blocking my strip! I\ncan't pass!\"\n\nOff to one side he sensed Varsi's laughter and on the other felt\nCaada's gloating greed.\n\n\"I cannot wake this metal,\" he thought hopelessly as he tried again,\nharder than before, ignoring the pain of his burning flesh.\n\nSomething clicked sharply within the metal, and the tempo of the sounds\nchanged.\n\n\"It's waking!\" Kworn thought wildly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a creaking noise from above. A rod moved out from the\ncylinder and twisted into the ground in Varsi's territory, to the\naccompaniment of clicking, grinding noises. A square grid lifted from\nthe top of the cylinder and began rotating. And Kworn shivered and\njerked to the tremendous power of the words that flowed through him.\nThey were words, but they had no meaning, waves of sound that hammered\nat his receptors in an unknown tongue he could not understand. The\nlanguage of the Folk had changed since the days of the ancients, he\nthought despairingly.\n\nAnd then, with a mantle-shattering roar, the cylinders jutting overhead\nspouted flame and smoke. Two silvery balls trailing thin, dark\nfilaments shot out of the great cylinder and buried themselves in the\nsand behind him. The filaments lay motionless in the sand as Kworn,\nwrapped defensively in his mantle, rolled off the ramp to the ground\nbelow.\n\nThe silence that followed was so deep that it seemed like Emptiness had\ntaken the entire land.\n\nSlowly Kworn loosened his mantle. \"In the name of my first ancestor,\"\nhe murmured shakily, \"what was that?\" His senses were shocked and\ndisorganized by the violence of the sound. It was worse even than the\nroar and scream of the samshin that occasionally blew from the south,\ncarrying dust, lichens, feeders and even Folk who had been too slow or\ntoo foolish to hide from the fury of the wind.\n\nGingerly, Kworn inspected the damage to his mantle. It was minor. A\ntiny rip that could easily be repaired, a few grains of sand that could\nbe extruded. He drew himself together to perform the repairs with the\nleast possible loss of energy, and as he did, he was conscious of an\nemanation coming from the filaments that had been hurled from the\ncylinder.\n\nFood!\n\nAnd such food!\n\nIt was the distilled quintessence of a thousand purple feeders! It\ncame to his senses in a shimmering wave of ecstasy so great that his\nmantle glowed a bright crimson. He stretched a pseudopod toward its\nsource, and as he touched the filament his whole body quivered with\nanticipation. The barrier was blotted from his thoughts by an orgy\nof shuddering delight almost too great for flesh to endure. Waves of\npleasure ran through his body as he swiftly extended to cover the\nfilament. It could be a trap, he thought, but it made no difference.\nThe demands of his depleted body and the sheer vacuole-constricting\ndelight of this incredible foodstuff made a combination too potent for\nhis will to resist, even if it had desired to do so. Waves of pleasure\nrippled through him as more of his absorptive surface contacted the\nfilament. He snuggled against it, enfolding it completely, letting the\nperistaltic rushes sweep through him. He had never fed like this as\nlong as he could recall. His energy levels swelled and pulsed as he\nsucked the last delight from the cord, and contemplated the further\npleasure waiting for him in that other one lying scarcely twenty raads\naway.\n\nSensuously, he extended a pseudopod from his upper surface and probed\nfor the other filament. He was filled to the top of his primary vacuole\nbut the desire for more was stronger than ever--despite the fact that\nhe knew the food in the other filament would bring him to critical\nlevel, would force him to reproduce. The thought amused him. As far\nback as he could remember, no member of the Folk had ever budded an\noffspring during the Time of Travel. It would be unheard of, something\nthat would go down through the years in the annals of the Folk, and\nperhaps even cause a change in the Law.\n\nThe pseudopod probed, reached and stopped short of its goal. There was\nnothing around it but empty air.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFear drove the slow orgasmic thoughts from his mind. Absorbed in\ngluttony, he hadn't noticed that the filament had tightened and was\nslowly drawing back into the cylinder from whence it came. And now it\nwas too late! He was already over the rim of the metal disc.\n\nFeverishly, he tried to disengage his absorptive surfaces from the\nfilament and crawl down its length to safety, but he couldn't move. He\nwas stuck to the dark cord by some strange adhesive that cemented his\ncells firmly to the cord. He could not break free.\n\nThe line moved steadily upward, dragging him inexorably toward a dark\nopening in the cylinder overhead. Panic filled him! Desperately he\ntried to loosen his trapped surfaces. His pseudopod lashed futilely\nin the air, searching with panic for something to grip, something to\nclutch that would stop this slow movement to the hell of pain that\nwaited for him in the metal high overhead.\n\nHis searching flesh struck another's, and into his mind flooded the Ul\nCaada's terrified thought. The old one had reacted quicker than he,\nperhaps because he was poaching, but like himself he was attached and\ncould not break free.\n\n\"Serves you right,\" Kworn projected grimly. \"The thing was on my land.\nYou had no right to feed upon it.\"\n\n\"Get me loose!\" Caada screamed. His body flopped at the end of a\nthick mass of digestive tissue, dangling from the line, writhing and\nstruggling in mindless terror. It was strange, Kworn thought, that fear\nshould be so much stronger in the old than in the young.\n\n\"Cut loose, you fool,\" Kworn projected. \"There isn't enough of you\nadhered to hurt if it were lost. A little body substance isn't worth\nyour life. Hurry! You'll be too late if you don't. That metal is\npoisonous to our flesh.\"\n\n\"But it will be pain to cut my absorbing surface,\" Caada protested.\n\n\"It will be death if you don't.\"\n\n\"Then why don't you?\"\n\n\"I can't,\" Kworn said hopelessly. \"All my surface is stuck to the\nfilament. I can't cut free.\" He was calm now, resigned to the\ninevitable. His greed had brought him to this. Perhaps it was a fitting\npunishment. But Caada need not die if he would show courage.\n\nHe rotated his eye to watch his struggling neighbor. Apparently Caada\nwas going to take his advice. The tissue below the part of him stuck\nto the filament began to thin. His pseudopod broke contact. But his\nmovements were slow and hesitant. Already his body mass was rising\nabove the edge of the disc.\n\n\"Quick, you fool!\" Kworn projected. \"Another moment and you're dead!\"\n\nBut Caada couldn't hear. Slowly his tissues separated as he reluctantly\nabandoned his absorptive surface. But he was already over the disc.\nThe last cells pinched off and he fell, mantle flapping, full on the\nsurface of the disc. For a moment he lay there quivering, and then his\nbody was blotted from sight by a cloud of frozen steam, and his essence\nvanished screaming into Emptiness.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKworn shuddered. It was a terrible way to die. But his own fate would\nbe no better. He wrapped his mantle tightly around him as his leading\nparts vanished into the dark hole in the cylinder. In a moment he would\nbe following Caada on the journey from which no member of the Folk had\never returned. His body disappeared into the hole.\n\n--and was plunged into paradise!\n\nHis foreparts slipped into a warm, thick liquid that loosened the\nadhesive that bound him to the cord. As he slipped free, he slowly\nrealized that he was not to die. He was bathed in liquid food! He was\nswimming in it! He was surrounded on all sides by incredible flavors\nso strange and delicious that his mind could not classify them! The\nfilament had been good, but this--this was indescribable! He relaxed,\nhis mantle spreading through the food, savoring, absorbing, digesting,\nmetabolizing, excreting. His energy levels peaked. The nuclei of his\ngerm plasm swelled, their chromosomes split, and a great bud formed and\nseparated from his body. He had reproduced!\n\nThrough a deadening fog of somatic sensation, he realized dully that\nthis was wrong, that the time wasn't right, that the space was limited,\nand that the natural reaction to abundant food supply was wrong. But\nfor the moment he didn't care.\n\nFor thousands of seasons he had traveled the paths between equator and\npole in a ceaseless hunt for food, growing and rejuvenating in good\nseasons, shrinking and aging in bad. He had been bound to the soil, a\nslave to the harsh demands of life and Nature. And now the routine was\nbroken.\n\nHe luxuriated in his freedom. It must have been like this in the old\ndays, when the waters were plentiful and things grew in them that\ncould be eaten, and the Folk had time to dream young dreams and think\nyoung thoughts, and build their thoughts and dreams into the gleaming\nrealities of cities and machines. Those were the days when the mind\nwent above the soil into the air and beyond it to the moons, the sun\nand the evening stars.\n\nBut that was long ago.\n\nHe lay quietly, conscious of the change within him as his cells\nmultiplied to replace those he had lost, and his body grew in weight\nand size. He was rejuvenated. The cells of his growing body, stimulated\nby the abundance of food, released memories he had forgotten he had\never possessed. His past ran in direct cellular continuity to the dawn\nof his race, and in him was every memory he had experienced since\nthe beginning. Some were weak, others were stronger, but all were\nthere awaiting an effort of recall. All that was required was enough\nstimulation to bring them out of hiding.\n\nAnd for the first time in millennia the stimulus was available. The\nstimulus was growth, the rapid growth that only an abundant food supply\ncould give, the sort of growth that the shrunken environment outside\ncould not supply. With sudden clarity he saw how the Folk had shrunk in\nmind and body as they slowly adapted to the ever-increasing rigor of\nlife. The rushing torrent of memory and sensation that swept through\nhim gave him a new awareness of what he had been once and what he had\nbecome. His eye was lifted from the dirt and lichens.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhat he saw filled him with pity and contempt. Pity for what the Folk\nhad become; contempt for their failure to recognize it. Yet he had been\nno better than the others. It was only through the accident of this\nartefact that he had learned. The Folk _couldn't_ know what the slow\ndwindling of their food supply had done to them. Over the millennia\nthey had adapted, changing to fit the changing conditions, surviving\nonly because they were more intelligent and more tenacious than the\nother forms of life that had become extinct. A thousand thousand\nseasons had passed since the great war that had devastated the world.\nA million years of slow adaptation to the barren waste that had been\nformed when the ultimate products of Folk technology were loosed on\ntheir creators, had created a race tied to a subsistence level of\nexistence, incapable of thinking beyond the basic necessities of life.\n\nThe Ul Kworn sighed. It would be better if he would not remember so\nmuch. But he could suppress neither the knowledge nor the memories.\nThey crowded in upon him, stimulated by the food in which he floated.\n\nBeside him, his offspring was growing. A bud always grew rapidly in\na favorable environment, and this one was ideal. Soon it would be as\nlarge as himself. Yet it would never develop beyond an infant. It could\nnot mature without a transfer of germ plasm from other infants of the\nFolk. And there were no infants.\n\nIt would grow and keep on growing because there would be no check of\nmaturity upon its cells. It would remain a partly sentient lump of\nflesh that would never be complete. And in time it would be dangerous.\nWhen it had depleted the food supply it would turn on him in mindless\nhunger. It wouldn't realize that the Ul Kworn was its father, or if it\ndid, it wouldn't care. An infant is ultimately selfish, and its desires\nare the most important thing in its restricted universe.\n\nKworn considered his situation dispassionately.\n\nIt was obvious that he must escape from this trap before his offspring\ndestroyed him. Yet he could think of no way to avoid the poison\nmetal. He recognized it now, the element with the twelve protons in\nits nucleus, a light metal seldom used by the Folk even in the days\nof their greatness because of its ability to rapidly oxidize and its\npropensity to burst into brilliant flame when heated. With sudden shock\nhe realized that the artefact was nothing less than a gigantic torch!\n\nWhy had it been built like this? What was its function? Where had it\ncome from? Why hadn't it spoke since it had released that flood of\nunintelligible gibberish before it had drawn him inside? Ever since he\nhad entered this food tank it had been quiet except for a clicking,\nchattering whir that came from somewhere above him. He had the odd\nimpression that it was storing information about him and the way he\nreacted in the tank.\n\nAnd then, abruptly, it broke into voice. Cryptic words poured from it,\npiercing him with tiny knives of sound. The intensity and rapidity of\nthe projections shocked him, left him quivering and shaking when they\nstopped as abruptly as they had begun.\n\nIn the quiet that followed, Kworn tried to recall the sequence of the\nnoise. The words were like nothing he had ever heard. They were not the\nlanguage of the Folk either past or present. And they had a flow and\nsequence that was not organic. They were mechanical, the product of a\nmetal intelligence that recorded and spoke but did not think. The Folk\nhad machines like that once.\n\nHow had it begun? There had been a faint preliminary, an almost\nsoundless voice speaking a single word. Perhaps if he projected it,\nit would trigger a response. Pitching his voice in the same key and\nintensity he projected the word as best he could remember it.\n\nAnd the voice began again.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKworn quivered with excitement. Something outside the artefact was\nforcing it to speak. He was certain of it. As certain as he was that\nthe artefact was recording himself and his offspring. But who--or\nwhat--was receiving the record? And why?\n\nThis could be a fascinating speculation, Kworn thought. But there\nwould be time enough for that later. His immediate need was to get out.\nAlready the food supply was running low, and his offspring was becoming\nenormous. He'd have to leave soon if he was ever going to. And he'd\nhave to do something about his own growth. Already it was reaching\ndangerous levels. He was on the ragged edge of another reproduction,\nand he couldn't afford it.\n\nRegretfully, he began moving the cornified cells of his mantle and his\nunder layer toward his inner surfaces, arranging them in a protective\nlayer around his germ plasm and absorptive cells. There would be enough\nsurface absorption to take care of his maintenance needs, and his body\ncould retain its peak of cellular energy. Yet the desire to feed and\nbud was almost overpowering. His body screamed at him for denying it\nthe right that food would give it, but Kworn resisted the demands of\nhis flesh until the frantic cellular urges passed.\n\nBeside him his offspring pulsed with physical sensation. Kworn envied\nit even as he pitied it. The poor mindless thing could be used as a\nmeans to the end of his escape, but it was useless for anything else.\nIt was far too large, and far too stupid, to survive in the outside\nworld. Kworn extruded a net of hairlike pseudopods and swept the tank\nin which they lay. It was featureless, save for a hole where the\nfilament had not completely withdrawn when it had pulled him into\nthis place. A few places in the wall had a different texture than the\nothers, probably the sense organs of the recorder. He rippled with\nsatisfaction. There was a grille of poison metal in the top of the tank\nthrough which flowed a steady current of warm air. It would be pleasant\nto investigate this further, Kworn thought, but there was no time. His\noffspring had seen to that.\n\nHe placed his eye on a thin pseudopod and thrust it through the hole in\nthe wall of the tank. It was still night outside, but a faint line of\nbrightness along the horizon indicated the coming of dawn. The artefact\nglittered icily beneath him, and he had a feeling of giddiness as he\nlooked down the vertiginous drop to the disc below. The dark blotch of\nCaada's burned body was almost invisible against the faintly gleaming\nloom of the still-warm disc. Kworn shuddered. Caada hadn't deserved a\ndeath like that. Kworn looked down, estimating the chances with his new\nintelligence, and then slapped a thick communication fibril against his\noffspring's quivering flesh and hurled a projection at its recoiling\nmass.\n\nConsidering the fact that its cells were direct derivations of his\nown, Kworn thought grimly, it was surprising how hard it was to\nestablish control. The youngster had developed a surprising amount of\nindividuality in its few xals of free existence. He felt a surge of\nthankfulness to the old Ul Kworn as the youngster yielded to his firm\nprojection. His precursor had always sought compliant germ plasm to\nproduce what he had called \"discipline and order.\" It was, in fact,\nweakness. It was detrimental to survival. But right now that weakness\nwas essential.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUnder the probing lash of his projection the infant extruded a thick\nmass of tissue that met and interlocked with a similar mass of his own.\nAs soon as the contact firmed, Kworn began flowing toward his eye,\nwhich was still in the half-open hole in the side of the tank.\n\nThe outside cold struck his sense centers with spicules of ice as he\nflowed to the outside, clinging to his offspring's gradually extending\npseudopod. Slowly he dropped below the cylinder. The infant was\nfrantic. It disliked the cold and struggled to break free, but Kworn\nclung limpetlike to his offspring's flesh as it twisted and writhed in\nan effort to return to the warmth and comfort into which it was born.\n\n\"Let go!\" his offspring screamed. \"I don't like this place.\"\n\n\"In a moment,\" Kworn said as he turned the vague writhings into a\nswinging pendulum motion. \"Help me move back and forth.\"\n\n\"I can't. I'm cold. I hurt. Let me go!\"\n\n\"Help me,\" Kworn ordered grimly, \"or hang out here and freeze.\"\n\nHis offspring shuddered and twitched. The momentum of the swing\nincreased. Kworn tightened his grip.\n\n\"You promised to let go!\" his offspring wailed. \"You prom--\"\n\nThe infant's projection was cut off as Kworn loosed himself at the\nupward arc of the swing, spread his mantle and plummeted toward the\nground. Fear swept through him as his body curved through the thin\nair, missing the edge of the disc and landing on the ground with a\nsense-jarring thud. Behind and above him up against the cylinder, the\nthick tendril of his offspring's flesh withdrew quickly from sight.\nFor a moment the Ul Kworn's gaze remained riveted on the row of odd\nmarkings on the metal surface, and then he turned his attention to life.\n\nThere was no reason to waste the pain of regret upon that half\nsentient mass of tissue that was his offspring. The stupid flesh of his\nflesh would remain happy in the darkness with the dwindling food until\nits flesh grew great enough to touch the poison metal in the ceiling of\nthe tank.\n\nAnd then--\n\nWith a harsh projection of horror, the Ul Kworn moved, circling the\nartefact on Caada's vacated strip. And as he moved he concentrated\nenergy into his high-level communication organs, and projected a\nwarning of danger.\n\n\"Move!\" he screamed. \"Move forward for your lives!\"\n\nThe line rippled. Reddish mantles unfolded as the Folk reacted. The\nnearest, shocked from estivation, were in motion even before they came\nto full awareness. Alarms like this weren't given without reason.\n\nVarsi's reaction, Kworn noted, was faster than any of his fellows.\nThe young Ul had some favorable self-preservation characteristics.\nHe'd have to consider sharing some germ plasm with him at the next\nreproduction season, after all.\n\nIn a giant arc, the Folk pressed forward under the white glow of\nemerging dawn. Behind them the artefact began to project again in its\nstrange tongue. But in mid-cry it stopped abruptly. And from it came\na wail of mindless agony that tore at Kworn's mind with regret more\nbitter because nothing could be done about it.\n\nHis offspring had touched the poison metal.\n\nKworn turned his eye backwards. The artefact was shaking on its broad\nbase from the violence of his offspring's tortured writhings. As he\nwatched a brilliant burst of light flared from its top. Heat swept\nacross the land, searing the lichens and a scattered few of the Folk\ntoo slow to escape. The giant structure burned with a light more\nbrilliant than the sun and left behind a great cloud of white vapor\nthat hung on the air like the menacing cloud of a samshin. Beneath the\ncloud the land was bare save for a few twisted pieces of smoking metal.\n\nThe roadblock was gone.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKworn moved slowly forward, gleaning Caada's strip and half of his own\nwhich he shared with Varsi.\n\nHe would need that young Ul in the future. It was well to place him\nunder an obligation. The new thoughts and old memories weren't dying.\nThey remained, and were focused upon the idea of living better than\nat this subsistence level. It should be possible to grow lichens, and\nbreed a more prolific type of lichen feeder. Water channeled from the\ncanals would stimulate lichen growth a thousand-fold. And with a more\nabundant food supply, perhaps some of the Folk could be stimulated to\nthink and apply ancient buried skills to circumvent Nature.\n\nIt was theoretically possible. The new breed would have to be like\nVarsi, tough, driving and selfishly independent. In time they might\ninherit the world. Civilization could arise again. It was not\nimpossible.\n\nHis thoughts turned briefly back to the artefact. It still bothered\nhim. He still knew far too little about it. It was a fascinating\nspeculation to dream of what it might have been. At any rate, one thing\nwas sure. It was not a structure of his race. If nothing else, those\ncabalistic markings on the side of the cylinder were utterly alien.\n\nThoughtfully he traced them in the sand. What did they mean?\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of On the Fourth Planet, by J.F.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\nwww.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\nU.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the\nmailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its\nvolunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous\nlocations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt\nLake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Newby\n    Chief Executive and Director\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
