As usual, I was wondering what it would take,\nshort of a revolution, to get the city of Port Sandor as clean and\ntidy and well lighted as the spaceport area. I knew Dad's editorials\nand my sarcastic news stories wouldn't do it. We'd been trying long\nenough.\n\nThe two girls in bikinis in front of me pushed on, still gabbling\nabout the fight one of them had had with her boy friend, and I closed\nup behind the half dozen monster-hunters in long trousers, ankle boots\nand short boat-jackets, with big knives on their belts. They must have\nall been from the same crew, because they weren't arguing about whose\nship was fastest, had the toughest skipper, and made the most money.\nThey were talking about the price of tallow-wax, and they seemed to\nhave picked up a rumor that it was going to be cut another ten\ncentisols a pound. I eavesdropped shamelessly, but it was the same\nrumor I'd picked up, myself, a little earlier.\n\n\"Hi, Walt,\" somebody behind me called out. \"Looking for some news\nthat's fit to print?\"\n\nI turned my head. It was a man of about thirty-five with curly brown\nhair and a wide grin. Adolf Lautier, the entertainment promoter. He\nand Dad each owned a share in the Port Sandor telecast station, and\nsplit their time between his music and drama-films and Dad's\nnewscasts.\n\n\"All the news is fit to print, and if it's news the _Times_ prints\nit,\" I told him. \"Think you're going to get some good thrillers this\ntime?\"\n\nHe shrugged. I'd just asked that to make conversation; he never had\nany way of knowing what sort of films would come in. The ones the\n_Peenem\u00fcnde_ was bringing should be fairly new, because she was\noutbound from Terra. He'd go over what was aboard, and trade one for\none for the old films he'd shown already.\n\n\"They tell me there's a real Old-Terran-style Western been showing on\nV\u00f6lund that ought to be coming our way this time,\" he said. \"It was\nfilmed in South America, with real horses.\"\n\nThat would go over big here. Almost everybody thought horses were as\nextinct as dinosaurs. I've seen so-called Westerns with the cowboys\nriding Freyan _oukry_. I mentioned that, and then added:\n\n\"They'll think the old cattle towns like Dodge and Abilene were awful\nsissy places, though.\"\n\n\"I suppose they were, compared to Port Sandor,\" Lautier said. \"Are you\ngoing aboard to interview the distinguished visitor?\"\n\n\"Which one?\" I asked. \"Glenn Murell or Leo Belsher?\"\n\nLautier called Leo Belsher something you won't find in the dictionary\nbut which nobody needs to look up. The hunters, ahead of us, heard\nhim and laughed. They couldn't possibly have agreed more. He was going\nto continue with the fascinating subject of Mr. Leo Belsher's ancestry\nand personal characteristics, and then bit it off short. I followed\nhis eyes, and saw old Professor Hartzenbosch, the principal of the\nschool, approaching.\n\n\"Ah, here you are, Mr. Lautier,\" he greeted. \"I trust that I did not\nkeep you waiting.\" Then he saw me. \"Why, it's Walter Boyd. How is your\nfather, Walter?\"\n\nI assured him as to Dad's health and inquired about his own, and then\nasked him how things were going at school. As well as could be\nexpected, he told me, and I gathered that he kept his point of\nexpectation safely low. Then he wanted to know if I were going aboard\nto interview Mr. Murell.\n\n\"Really, Walter, it is a wonderful thing that a famous author like Mr.\nMurell should come here to write a book about our planet,\" he told me,\nvery seriously, and added, as an afterthought: \"Have you any idea\nwhere he intends staying while he is among us?\"\n\n\"Why, yes,\" I admitted. \"After the _Peenem\u00fcnde_ radioed us their\npassenger list, Dad talked to him by screen, and invited him to stay\nwith us. Mr. Murell accepted, at least until he can find quarters of\nhis own.\"\n\nThere are a lot of good poker players in Port Sandor, but Professor\nJan Hartzenbosch is not one of them. The look of disappointment would\nhave been comical if it hadn't been so utterly pathetic. He'd been\nhoping to lasso Murell himself.\n\n\"I wonder if Mr. Murell could spare time to come to the school and\nspeak to the students,\" he said, after a moment.\n\n\"I'm sure he could. I'll mention it to him, Professor,\" I promised.\n\nProfessor Hartzenbosch bridled at that. The great author ought to be\ncoming to his school out of respect for him, not because a\nseventeen-year-old cub reporter sent him. But then, Professor\nHartzenbosch always took the attitude that he was conferring a favor\non the _Times_ when he had anything he wanted publicity on.\n\nThe elevator door opened, and Lautier and the professor joined in the\npush to get into it. I hung back, deciding to wait for the next one so\nthat I could get in first and get back to the rear, where my hamper\nwouldn't be in people's way. After a while, it came back empty and I\ngot on, and when the crowd pushed off on the top level, I put my\nhamper back on contragravity and towed it out into the outdoor air,\nwhich by this time had gotten almost as cool as a bake-oven.\n\nI looked up at the sky, where everybody else was looking. The\n_Peenem\u00fcnde_ wasn't visible; it was still a few thousand miles\noff-planet. Big ragged clouds were still blowing in from the west,\nvery high, and the sunset was even brighter and redder than when I had\nseen it last, ten hours before. It was now about 1630.\n\nNow, before anybody starts asking just who's crazy, let me point out\nthat this is not on Terra, nor on Baldur nor Thor nor Odin nor Freya,\nnor any other rational planet. This is Fenris, and on Fenris the\nsunsets, like many other things, are somewhat peculiar.\n\nFenris is the second planet of a G_{4} star, six hundred and fifty\nlight-years to the Galactic southwest of the Sol System. Everything\nelse equal, it should have been pretty much Terra type; closer to a\ncooler primary and getting about the same amount of radiation. At\nleast, that's what the book says. I was born on Fenris, and have never\nbeen off it in the seventeen years since.\n\nEverything else, however, is not equal. The Fenris year is a trifle\nshorter than the Terran year we use for Atomic Era dating, eight\nthousand and a few odd Galactic Standard hours. In that time, Fenris\nmakes almost exactly four axial rotations. This means that on one side\nthe sun is continuously in the sky for a thousand hours, pouring down\nunceasing heat, while the other side is in shadow. You sleep eight\nhours, and when you get up and go outside--in an insulated vehicle, or\nan extreme-environment suit--you find that the shadows have moved only\nan inch or so, and it's that much hotter. Finally, the sun crawls down\nto the horizon and hangs there for a few days--periods of twenty-four\nG.S. hours--and then slides slowly out of sight. Then, for about a\nhundred hours, there is a beautiful unfading sunset, and it's really\npleasant outdoors. Then it gets darker and colder until, just before\nsunrise, it gets almost cold enough to freeze CO_{2}. Then the sun\ncomes up, and we begin all over again.\n\nYou are picking up the impression, I trust, that as planets go, Fenris\nis nobody's bargain. It isn't a real hell-planet, and spacemen haven't\nmade a swear word out of its name, as they have with the name of\nfluorine-atmosphere Nifflheim, but even the Reverend Hiram Zilker, the\nOrthodox-Monophysite preacher, admits that it's one of those planets\nthe Creator must have gotten a trifle absent-minded with.\n\nThe chartered company that colonized it, back at the end of the Fourth\nCentury A.E., went bankrupt in ten years, and it wouldn't have taken\nthat long if communication between Terra and Fenris hadn't been a\nmatter of six months each way. When the smash finally came, two\nhundred and fifty thousand colonists were left stranded. They lost\neverything they'd put into the company, which, for most of them, was\nall they had. Not a few lost their lives before the Federation Space\nNavy could get ships here to evacuate them.\n\nBut about a thousand, who were too poor to make a fresh start\nelsewhere and too tough for Fenris to kill, refused evacuation, took\nover all the equipment and installations the Fenris Company had\nabandoned, and tried to make a living out of the planet. At least,\nthey stayed alive. There are now twenty-odd thousand of us, and while\nwe are still very poor, we are very tough, and we brag about it.\n\nThere were about two thousand people--ten per cent of the planetary\npopulation--on the wide concrete promenade around the spaceport\nlanding pit. I came out among them and set down the hamper with my\ntelecast cameras and recorders, wishing, as usual, that I could find\nsome ten or twelve-year-old kid weak-minded enough to want to be a\nreporter when he grew up, so that I could have an apprentice to help\nme with my junk.\n\nAs the star--and only--reporter of the greatest--and only--paper on\nthe planet, I was always on hand when either of the two ships on the\nTerra-Odin milk run, the _Peenem\u00fcnde_ and the _Cape Canaveral_,\nlanded. Of course, we always talk to them by screen as soon as they\ncome out of hyperspace and into radio range, and get the passenger\nlist, and a speed-recording of any news they are carrying, from the\nlatest native uprising on Thor to the latest political scandal on\nVenus. Sometime the natives of Thor won't be fighting anybody at all,\nor the Federation Member Republic of Venus will have some\nnonscandalous politics, and either will be the man-bites-dog story to\nend man-bites-dog stories. All the news is at least six months old,\nsome more than a year. A spaceship can log a light-year in sixty-odd\nhours, but radio waves still crawl along at the same old 186,000 mps.\n\nI still have to meet the ships. There's always something that has to\nbe picked up personally, usually an interview with some VIP traveling\nthrough. This time, though, the big story coming in on the\n_Peenem\u00fcnde_ was a local item. Paradox? Dad says there is no such\nthing. He says a paradox is either a verbal contradiction, and you get\nrid of it by restating it correctly, or it's a structural\ncontradiction, and you just call it an impossibility and let it go at\nthat. In this case, what was coming in was a real live author, who was\ngoing to write a travel book about Fenris, the planet with the\nfour-day year. Glenn Murell, which sounded suspiciously like a nom de\nplume, and nobody here had ever heard of him.\n\nThat was odd, too. One thing we can really be proud of here, besides\nthe toughness of our citizens, is our public library. When people have\nto stay underground most of the time to avoid being fried and/or\nfrozen to death, they have a lot of time to kill, and reading is one\nof the cheaper and more harmless and profitable ways of doing it. And\ntravel books are a special favorite here. I suppose because everybody\nis hoping to read about a worse place than Fenris. I had checked on\nGlenn Murell at the library. None of the librarians had ever heard of\nhim, and there wasn't a single mention of him in any of the big\ncatalogues of publications.\n\nThe first and obvious conclusion would be that Mr. Glenn Murell was\nsome swindler posing as an author. The only objection to that was that\nI couldn't quite see why any swindler would come to Fenris, or what\nhe'd expect to swindle the Fenrisians out of. Of course, he could be\non the lam from somewhere, but in that case why bother with all the\ncover story? Some of our better-known citizens came here dodging\nwarrants on other planets.\n\nI was still wondering about Murell when somebody behind me greeted me,\nand I turned around. It was Tom Kivelson.\n\nTom and I are buddies, when he's in port. He's just a shade older than\nI am; he was eighteen around noon, and my eighteenth birthday won't\ncome till midnight, Fenris Standard Sundial Time. His father is Joe\nKivelson, the skipper of the _Javelin_; Tom is sort of junior\nengineer, second gunner, and about third harpooner. We went to school\ntogether, which is to say a couple of years at Professor\nHartzenbosch's, learning to read and write and put figures together.\nThat is all the schooling anybody on Fenris gets, although Joe\nKivelson sent Tom's older sister, Linda, to school on Terra. Anybody\nwho stays here has to dig out education for himself. Tom and I were\nstill digging for ours.\n\nEach of us envied the other, when we weren't thinking seriously about\nit. I imagined that sea-monster hunting was wonderfully thrilling and\nromantic, and Tom had the idea that being a newsman was real hot\nstuff. When we actually stopped to think about it, though, we realized\nthat neither of us would trade jobs and take anything at all for boot.\nTom couldn't string three sentences--no, one sentence--together to\nsave his life, and I'm just a town boy who likes to live in something\nthat isn't pitching end-for-end every minute.\n\nTom is about three inches taller than I am, and about thirty pounds\nheavier. Like all monster-hunters, he's trying to grow a beard, though\nat present it's just a blond chin-fuzz. I was surprised to see him\ndressed as I was, in shorts and sandals and a white shirt and a light\njacket. Ordinarily, even in town, he wears boat-clothes. I looked\naround behind him, and saw the brass tip of a scabbard under the\njacket. Any time a hunter-ship man doesn't have his knife on, he isn't\nwearing anything else. I wondered about his being in port now. I knew\nJoe Kivelson wouldn't bring his ship in just to meet the _Peenem\u00fcnde_,\nwith only a couple of hundred hours' hunting left till the storms and\nthe cold.\n\n\"I thought you were down in the South Ocean,\" I said.\n\n\"There's going to be a special meeting of the Co-op,\" he said. \"We\nonly heard about it last evening,\" by which he meant after 1800 of\nthe previous Galactic Standard day. He named another hunter-ship\ncaptain who had called the _Javelin_ by screen. \"We screened everybody\nelse we could.\"\n\nThat was the way they ran things in the Hunters' Co-operative. Steve\nRavick would wait till everybody had their ships down on the coast of\nHermann Reuch's Land, and then he would call a meeting and pack it\nwith his stooges and hooligans, and get anything he wanted voted\nthrough. I had always wondered how long the real hunters were going to\nstand for that. They'd been standing for it ever since I could\nremember anything outside my own playpen, which, of course, hadn't\nbeen too long.\n\nI was about to say something to that effect, and then somebody yelled,\n\"There she is!\" I took a quick look at the radar bowls to see which\nway they were pointed and followed them up to the sky, and caught a\ntiny twinkle through a cloud rift. After a moment's mental arithmetic\nto figure how high she'd have to be to catch the sunlight, I relaxed.\nEven with the telephoto, I'd only get a picture the size of a pinhead,\nso I fixed the position in my mind and then looked around at the\ncrowd.\n\nAmong them were two men, both well dressed. One was tall and slender,\nwith small hands and feet; the other was short and stout, with a\nscrubby gray-brown mustache. The slender one had a bulge under his\nleft arm, and the short-and-stout job bulged over the right hip. The\nformer was Steve Ravick, the boss of the Hunters' Co-operative, and\nhis companion was the Honorable Morton Hallstock, mayor of Port\nSandor and consequently the planetary government of Fenris.\n\nThey had held their respective positions for as long as I could\nremember anything at all. I could never remember an election in Port\nSandor, or an election of officers in the Co-op. Ravick had a bunch of\ngoons and triggermen--I could see a couple of them loitering in the\nbackground--who kept down opposition for him. So did Hallstock, only\nhis wore badges and called themselves police.\n\nOnce in a while, Dad would write a blistering editorial about one or\nthe other or both of them. Whenever he did, I would put my gun on, and\nso would Julio Kubanoff, the one-legged compositor who is the third\nmember of the Times staff, and we would take turns making sure nobody\ngot behind Dad's back. Nothing ever happened, though, and that always\nrather hurt me. Those two racketeers were in so tight they didn't need\nto care what the Times printed or 'cast about them.\n\nHallstock glanced over in my direction and said something to Ravick.\nRavick gave a sneering laugh, and then he crushed out the cigarette he\nwas smoking on the palm of his left hand. That was a regular trick of\nhis. Showing how tough he was. Dad says that when you see somebody\nshowing off, ask yourself whether he's trying to impress other people,\nor himself. I wondered which was the case with Steve Ravick.\n\nThen I looked up again. The _Peenem\u00fcnde_ was coming down as fast as\nshe could without over-heating from atmosphere friction. She was\nalmost buckshot size to the naked eye, and a couple of tugs were\ngetting ready to go up and meet her. I got the telephoto camera out\nof the hamper, checked it, and aimed it. It has a shoulder stock and\nhandgrips and a trigger like a submachine gun. I caught the ship in\nthe finder and squeezed the trigger for a couple of seconds. It would\nbe about five minutes till the tugs got to her and anything else\nhappened, so I put down the camera and looked around.\n\nComing through the crowd, walking as though the concrete under him was\npitching and rolling like a ship's deck on contragravity in a storm,\nwas Bish Ware. He caught sight of us, waved, overbalanced himself and\nrecovered, and then changed course to starboard and bore down on us.\nHe was carrying about his usual cargo, and as usual the manifest would\nread, _Baldur honey-rum, from Harry Wong's bar_.\n\nBish wasn't his real name. Neither, I suspected, was Ware. When he'd\nfirst landed on Fenris, some five years ago, somebody had nicknamed\nhim the Bishop, and before long that had gotten cut to one syllable.\nHe looked like a bishop, or at least like what anybody who's never\nseen a bishop outside a screen-play would think a bishop looked like.\nHe was a big man, not fat, but tall and portly; he had a ruddy face\nthat always wore an expression of benevolent wisdom, and the more\ncargo he took on the wiser and more benevolent he looked.\n\nHe had iron-gray hair, but he wasn't old. You could tell that by the\nbacks of his hands; they weren't wrinkled or crepy and the veins\ndidn't protrude. And drunk or sober--though I never remembered seeing\nhim in the latter condition--he had the fastest reflexes of anybody I\nknew. I saw him, once, standing at the bar in Harry Wong's, knock\nover an open bottle with his left elbow. He spun half around, grabbed\nit by the neck and set it up, all in one motion, without spilling a\ndrop, and he went on talking as though nothing had happened. He was\nquoting Homer, I remembered, and you could tell that he was thinking\nin the original ancient Greek and translating to Lingua Terra as he\nwent.\n\nHe was always dressed as he was now, in a conservative black suit, the\njacket a trifle longer than usual, and a black neckcloth with an Uller\norganic-opal pin. He didn't work at anything, but quarterly--once\nevery planetary day--a draft on the Banking Cartel would come in for\nhim, and he'd deposit it with the Port Sandor Fidelity & Trust. If\nanybody was unmannerly enough to ask him about it, he always said he\nhad a rich uncle on Terra.\n\nWhen I was a kid--well, more of a kid than I am now--I used to believe\nhe really was a bishop--unfrocked, of course, or ungaitered, or\nwhatever they call it when they give a bishop the heave-ho. A lot of\npeople who weren't kids still believed that, and they blamed him on\nevery denomination from Anglicans to Zen Buddhists, not even missing\nthe Satanists, and there were all sorts of theories about what he'd\ndone to get excommunicated, the mildest of which was that somewhere\nthere was a cathedral standing unfinished because he'd hypered out\nwith the building fund. It was generally agreed that his\necclesiastical organization was paying him to stay out there in the\nboondocks where he wouldn't cause them further embarrassment.\n\nI was pretty sure, myself, that he was being paid by somebody,\nprobably his family, to stay out of sight. The colonial planets are\nfull of that sort of remittance men.\n\nBish and I were pretty good friends. There were certain old ladies, of\nboth sexes and all ages, of whom Professor Hartzenbosch was an\nexample, who took Dad to task occasionally for letting me associate\nwith him. Dad simply ignored them. As long as I was going to be a\nreporter, I'd have to have news sources, and Bish was a dandy. He knew\nall the disreputable characters in town, which saved me having to\nassociate with all of them, and it is sad but true that you get very\nfew news stories in Sunday school. Far from fearing that Bish would be\na bad influence on me, he rather hoped I'd be a good one on Bish.\n\nI had that in mind, too, if I could think of any way of managing it.\nBish had been a good man, once. He still was, except for one thing.\nYou could tell that before he'd started drinking, he'd really been\nsomebody, somewhere. Then something pretty bad must have happened to\nhim, and now he was here on Fenris, trying to hide from it behind a\nbottle. Something ought to be done to give him a shove up on his feet\nagain. I hate waste, and a man of the sort he must have been turning\nhimself into the rumpot he was now was waste of the worst kind.\n\nIt would take a lot of doing, though, and careful tactical planning.\nPreaching at him would be worse than useless, and so would simply\ntrying to get him to stop drinking. That would be what Doc Rojansky,\nat the hospital, would call treating the symptoms. The thing to do was\nmake him want to stop drinking, and I didn't know how I was going to\nmanage that. I'd thought, a couple of times, of getting him to work on\nthe Times, but we barely made enough money out of it for ourselves,\nand with his remittance he didn't need to work. I had a lot of other\nideas, now and then, but every time I took a second look at one, it\ngot sick and died.\n\n\n\n\n2\n\nREPORTER WORKING\n\n\nBish came over and greeted us solemnly.\n\n\"Good afternoon, gentlemen. Captain Ahab, I believe,\" he said, bowing\nto Tom, who seemed slightly puzzled; the education Tom had been\ndigging out for himself was technical rather than literary. \"And Mr.\nPulitzer. Or is it Horace Greeley?\"\n\n\"Lord Beaverbrook, your Grace,\" I replied. \"Have you any little news\nitems for us from your diocese?\"\n\nBish teetered slightly, getting out a cigar and inspecting it\ncarefully before lighting it.\n\n\"We-el,\" he said carefully, \"my diocese is full to the hatch covers\nwith sinners, but that's scarcely news.\" He turned to Tom. \"One of\nyour hands on the _Javelin_ got into a fight in Martian Joe's, a while\nago. Lumped the other man up pretty badly.\" He named the Javelin\ncrewman, and the man who had been pounded. The latter was one of Steve\nRavick's goons. \"But not fatally, I regret to say,\" Bish added. \"The\nlocal Gestapo are looking for your man, but he made it aboard Nip\nSpazoni's _Bulldog_, and by this time he's halfway to Hermann Reuch's\nLand.\"\n\n\"Isn't Nip going to the meeting, tonight?\" Tom asked.\n\nBish shook his head. \"Nip is a peace-loving man. He has a well-founded\nsuspicion that peace is going to be in short supply around Hunters'\nHall this evening. You know, of course, that Leo Belsher's coming in\non the _Peenem\u00fcnde_ and will be there to announce another price cut.\nThe new price, I understand, will be thirty-five centisols a pound.\"\n\nSeven hundred sols a ton, I thought; why, that would barely pay ship\nexpenses.\n\n\"Where did you get that?\" Tom asked, a trifle sharply.\n\n\"Oh, I have my spies and informers,\" Bish said. \"And even if I hadn't,\nit would figure. The only reason Leo Belsher ever comes to this Eden\namong planets is to negotiate a new contract, and who ever heard of a\nnew contract at a higher price?\"\n\nThat had all happened before, a number of times. When Steve Ravick had\ngotten control of the Hunters' Co-operative, the price of tallow-wax,\non the loading floor at Port Sandor spaceport, had been fifteen\nhundred sols a ton. As far as Dad and I could find out, it was still\nbringing the same price on Terra as it always had. It looked to us as\nif Ravick and Leo Belsher, who was the Co-op representative on Terra,\nand Mort Hallstock were simply pocketing the difference. I was just as\nsore about what was happening as anybody who went out in the\nhunter-ships. Tallow-wax is our only export. All our imports are paid\nfor with credit from the sale of wax.\n\nIt isn't really wax, and it isn't tallow. It's a growth on the\nJarvis's sea-monster; there's a layer of it under the skin, and around\norgans that need padding. An average-sized monster, say a hundred and\nfifty feet long, will yield twelve to fifteen tons of it, and a good\nhunter kills about ten monsters a year. Well, at the price Belsher and\nRavick were going to cut from, that would run a little short of a\nhundred and fifty thousand sols for a year. If you say it quick enough\nand don't think, that sounds like big money, but the upkeep and\nsupplies for a hunter-ship are big money, too, and what's left after\nthat's paid off is divided, on a graduated scale, among ten to fifteen\nmen, from the captain down. A hunter-boat captain, even a good one\nlike Joe Kivelson, won't make much more in a year than Dad and I make\nout of the _Times_.\n\nChemically, tallow-wax isn't like anything else in the known Galaxy.\nThe molecules are huge; they can be seen with an ordinary optical\nmicroscope, and a microscopically visible molecule is a\ncurious-looking object, to say the least. They use the stuff to treat\nfabric for protective garments. It isn't anything like collapsium, of\ncourse, but a suit of waxed coveralls weighing only a couple of pounds\nwill stop as much radiation as half an inch of lead.\n\nBack when they were getting fifteen hundred a ton, the hunters had\nbeen making good money, but that was before Steve Ravick's time.\n\nIt was slightly before mine, too. Steve Ravick had showed up on Fenris\nabout twelve years ago. He'd had some money, and he'd bought shares in\na couple of hunter-ships and staked a few captains who'd had bad luck\nand got them in debt to him. He also got in with Morton Hallstock, who\ncontrolled what some people were credulous enough to take for a\ngovernment here. Before long, he was secretary of the Hunters'\nCo-operative. Old Simon MacGregor, who had been president then, was a\ngood hunter, but he was no businessman. He came to depend very heavily\non Ravick, up till his ship, the _Claymore_, was lost with all hands\ndown in Fitzwilliam Straits. I think that was a time bomb in the\nmagazine, but I have a low and suspicious mind. Professor Hartzenbosch\nhas told me so repeatedly. After that, Steve Ravick was president of\nthe Co-op. He immediately began a drive to increase the membership.\nMost of the new members had never been out in a hunter-ship in their\nlives, but they could all be depended on to vote the way he wanted\nthem to.\n\nFirst, he jacked the price of wax up, which made everybody but the wax\nbuyers happy. Everybody who wasn't already in the Co-op hurried up and\njoined. Then he negotiated an exclusive contract with Kapstaad\nChemical Products, Ltd., in South Africa, by which they agreed to take\nthe entire output for the Co-op. That ended competitive wax buying,\nand when there was nobody to buy the wax but Kapstaad, you had to sell\nit through the Co-operative or you didn't sell it at all. After that,\nthe price started going down. The Co-operative, for which read Steve\nRavick, had a sales representative on Terra, Leo Belsher. He wrote all\nthe contracts, collected all the money, and split with Ravick. What\nwas going on was pretty generally understood, even if it couldn't be\nproven, but what could anybody do about it?\n\nMaybe somebody would try to do something about it at the meeting this\nevening. I would be there to cover it. I was beginning to wish I owned\na bullet-proof vest.\n\nBish and Tom were exchanging views on the subject, some of them almost\nprintable. I had my eyes to my binoculars, watching the tugs go up to\nmeet the _Peenem\u00fcnde_.\n\n\"What we need for Ravick, Hallstock and Belsher,\" Tom was saying, \"is\nabout four fathoms of harpoon line apiece, and something to haul up\nto.\"\n\nThat kind of talk would have shocked Dad. He is very strong for law\nand order, even when there is no order and the law itself is illegal.\nI'd always thought there was a lot of merit in what Tom was\nsuggesting. Bish Ware seemed to have his doubts, though.\n\n\"Mmm, no; there ought to be some better way of doing it than that.\"\n\n\"Can you think of one?\" Tom challenged.\n\nI didn't hear Bish's reply. By that time, the tugs were almost to the\nship. I grabbed up the telephoto camera and aimed it. It has its own\npower unit, and transmits directly. In theory, I could tune it to the\ntelecast station and put what I was getting right on the air, and what\nI was doing was transmitting to the _Times_, to be recorded and 'cast\nlater. Because it's not a hundred per cent reliable, though, it makes\nits own audiovisual record, so if any of what I was sending didn't get\nthrough, it could be spliced in after I got back.\n\nI got some footage of the tugs grappling the ship, which was now\ncompletely weightless, and pulling her down. Through the finder, I\ncould see that she had her landing legs extended; she looked like a\nbig overfed spider being hauled in by a couple of gnats. I kept the\nbutt of the camera to my shoulder, and whenever anything interesting\nhappened, I'd squeeze the trigger. The first time I ever used a real\nsubmachine gun had been to kill a blue slasher that had gotten into\none of the ship pools at the waterfront. I used three one-second\nbursts, and threw bits of slasher all over the place, and everybody\nwondered how I'd gotten the practice.\n\nA couple more boats, pushers, went up to help hold the ship against\nthe wind, and by that time she was down to a thousand feet, which was\nhalf her diameter. I switched from the shoulder-stock telephoto to the\nbig tripod job, because this was the best part of it. The ship was\nweightless, of course, but she had mass and an awful lot of it. If\nanybody goofed getting her down, she'd take the side of the landing\npit out, and about ten per cent of the population of Fenris, including\nthe ace reporter for the Times, along with it.\n\nAt the same time, some workmen and a couple of spaceport cops had\nappeared, taken out a section of railing and put in a gate. The\n_Peenem\u00fcnde_ settled down, turned slowly to get her port in line with\nthe gate, and lurched off contragravity and began running out a bridge\nto the promenade. I got some shots of that, and then began packing my\nstuff back in the hamper.\n\n\"You going aboard?\" Tom asked. \"Can I come along? I can carry some of\nyour stuff and let on I'm your helper.\"\n\nGlory be, I thought; I finally got that apprentice.\n\n\"Why, sure,\" I said. \"You tow the hamper; I'll carry this.\" I got out\nwhat looked like a big camera case and slung it over my shoulder. \"But\nyou'll have to take me out on the _Javelin_, sometime, and let me\nshoot a monster.\"\n\nHe said it was a deal, and we shook on it. Then I had another idea.\n\n\"Bish, suppose you come with us, too,\" I said. \"After all, Tom and I\nare just a couple of kids. If you're with us, it'll look a lot more\nbig-paperish.\"\n\nThat didn't seem to please Tom too much. Bish shook his head, though,\nand Tom brightened.\n\n\"I'm dreadfully sorry, Walt,\" Bish said. \"But I'm going aboard,\nmyself, to see a friend who is en route through to Odin. A Dr. Watson;\nI have not seen him for years.\"\n\nI'd caught that name, too, when we'd gotten the passenger list. Dr.\nJohn Watson. Now, I know that all sorts of people call themselves\nDoctor, and Watson and John aren't too improbable a combination, but\nI'd read _Sherlock Holmes_ long ago, and the name had caught my\nattention. And this was the first, to my knowledge, that Bish Ware had\never admitted to any off-planet connections.\n\nWe started over to the gate. Hallstock and Ravick were ahead of us. So\nwas Sigurd Ngozori, the president of the Fidelity & Trust, carrying a\nheavy briefcase and accompanied by a character with a submachine gun,\nand Adolf Lautier and Professor Hartzenbosch. There were a couple of\nspaceport cops at the gate, in olive-green uniforms that looked as\nthough they had been sprayed on, and steel helmets. I wished we had a\ncity police force like that. They were Odin Dock & Shipyard Company\nmen, all former Federation Regular Army or Colonial Constabulary. The\nspaceport wasn't part of Port Sandor, or even Fenris; the Odin Dock &\nShipyard Company was the government there, and it was run honestly and\nefficiently.\n\nThey knew me, and when they saw Tom towing my hamper they cracked a\nfew jokes about the new _Times_ cub reporter and waved us through. I\nthought they might give Bish an argument, but they just nodded and let\nhim pass, too. We all went out onto the bridge, and across the pit to\nthe equator of the two-thousand-foot globular ship.\n\nWe went into the main lounge, and the captain introduced us to Mr.\nGlenn Murell. He was fairly tall, with light gray hair, prematurely\nso, I thought, and a pleasant, noncommittal face. I'd have pegged him\nfor a businessman. Well, I suppose authoring is a business, if that\nwas his business. He shook hands with us, and said:\n\n\"Aren't you rather young to be a newsman?\"\n\nI started to burn on that. I get it all the time, and it burns me all the\ntime, but worst of all on the job. Maybe I am only going-on-eighteen, but\nI'm doing a man's work, and I'm doing it competently.\n\n\"Well, they grow up young on Fenris, Mr. Murell,\" Captain Marshak\nearned my gratitude by putting in. \"Either that or they don't live to\ngrow up.\"\n\nMurell unhooked his memophone and repeated the captain's remark into\nit. Opening line for one of his chapters. Then he wanted to know if\nI'd been born on Fenris. I saw I was going to have to get firm with\nMr. Murell, right away. The time to stop that sort of thing is as soon\nas it starts.\n\n\"Who,\" I wanted to know, \"is interviewing whom? You'll have at least\nfive hundred hours till the next possible ship out of here; I only\nhave two and a half to my next deadline. You want coverage, don't you?\nThe more publicity you get, the easier your own job's going to be.\"\n\nThen I introduced Tom, carefully giving the impression that while I\nhandled all ordinary assignments, I needed help to give him the full\nVIP treatment. We went over to a quiet corner and sat down, and the\ninterview started.\n\nThe camera case I was carrying was a snare and a deceit. Everybody\nknows that reporters use recorders in interviews, but it never pays to\nbe too obtrusive about them, or the subject gets recorder-conscious\nand stiffens up. What I had was better than a recorder; it was a\nrecording radio. Like the audiovisuals, it not only transmitted in to\nthe _Times_, but made a recording as insurance against transmission\nfailure. I reached into a slit on the side and snapped on the switch\nwhile I was fumbling with a pencil and notebook with the other hand,\nand started by asking him what had decided him to do a book about\nFenris.\n\nAfter that, I fed a question every now and then to keep him running,\nand only listened to every third word. The radio was doing a better\njob than I possibly could have. At the same time, I was watching Steve\nRavick, Morton Hallstock and Leo Belsher at one side of the room, and\nBish Ware at the other. Bish was within ear-straining range. Out of\nthe corner of my eye, I saw another man, younger in appearance and\nlooking like an Army officer in civvies, approach him.\n\n\"My dear Bishop!\" this man said in greeting.\n\nAs far as I knew, that nickname had originated on Fenris. I made a\nmental note of that.\n\n\"How are you?\" Bish replied, grasping the other's hand. \"You have been\nin Afghanistan, I perceive.\"\n\nThat did it. I told you I was an old _Sherlock Holmes_ reader; I\nrecognized that line. This meeting was prearranged, neither of them\nhad ever met before, and they needed a recognition code. Then I\nreturned to Murell, and decided to wonder about Bish Ware and \"Dr.\nWatson\" later.\n\nIt wasn't long before I was noticing a few odd things about Murell,\ntoo, which confirmed my original suspicions of him. He didn't have the\nfirm name of his alleged publishers right, he didn't know what a\nliterary agent was and, after claiming to have been a newsman, he\nconsistently used the expression \"news service.\" I know, everybody\nsays that--everybody but newsmen. They always call a news service a\n\"paper,\" especially when talking to other newsmen.\n\nOf course, there isn't any paper connected with it, except the pad the\neditor doodles on. What gets to the public is photoprint, out of a\nteleprinter. As small as our circulation is, we have four or five\nhundred of them in Port Sandor and around among the small settlements\nin the archipelago, and even on the mainland. Most of them are in bars\nand cafes and cigar stores and places like that, operated by a coin in\na slot and leased by the proprietor, and some of the big hunter-ships\nlike Joe Kivelson's _Javelin_ and Nip Spazoni's _Bulldog_ have them.\n\nBut long ago, back in the First Centuries, Pre-Atomic and Atomic Era,\nthey were actually printed on paper, and the copies distributed and\nsold. They used printing presses as heavy as a spaceship's engines.\nThat's why we still call ourselves the Press. Some of the old papers\non Terra, like _La Prensa_ in Buenos Aires, and the Melbourne _Times_,\nwhich used to be the London _Times_ when there was still a London,\nwere printed that way originally.\n\nFinally I got through with my interview, and then shot about fifteen\nminutes of audiovisual, which would be cut to five for the 'cast. By\nthis time Bish and \"Dr. Watson\" had disappeared, I supposed to the\nship's bar, and Ravick and his accomplices had gotten through with\ntheir conspiracy to defraud the hunters. I turned Murell over to Tom,\nand went over to where they were standing together. I'd put away my\npencil and pad long ago with Murell; now I got them out ostentatiously\nas I approached.\n\n\"Good day, gentlemen,\" I greeted them. \"I'm representing the Port\nSandor _Times_.\"\n\n\"Oh, run along, sonny; we haven't time to bother with you,\" Hallstock\nsaid.\n\n\"But I want to get a story from Mr. Belsher,\" I began.\n\n\"Well, come back in five or six years, when you're dry behind the\nears, and you can get it,\" Ravick told me.\n\n\"Our readers aren't interested in the condition of my ears,\" I said\nsweetly. \"They want to read about the price of tallow-wax. What's this\nabout another price cut? To thirty-five centisols a pound, I\nunderstand.\"\n\n\"Oh, Steve, the young man's from the news service, and his father will\npublish whatever he brings home,\" Belsher argued. \"We'd better give\nhim something.\" He turned to me. \"I don't know how this got out, but\nit's quite true,\" he said. He had a long face, like a horse's. At\nleast, he looked like pictures of horses I'd seen. As he spoke, he\npulled it even longer and became as doleful as an undertaker at a\nten-thousand-sol funeral.\n\n\"The price has gone down, again. Somebody has developed a synthetic\nsubstitute. Of course, it isn't anywhere near as good as real Fenris\ntallow-wax, but try and tell the public that. So Kapstaad Chemical is\nbeing undersold, and the only way they can stay in business is cut the\nprice they have to pay for wax....\"\n\nIt went on like that, and this time I had real trouble keeping my\nanger down. In the first place, I was pretty sure there was no\nsubstitute for Fenris tallow-wax, good, bad or indifferent. In the\nsecond place, it isn't sold to the gullible public, it's sold to\nequipment manufacturers who have their own test engineers and who have\nto keep their products up to legal safety standards. He didn't know\nthis balderdash of his was going straight to the _Times_ as fast as he\nspouted it; he thought I was taking it down in shorthand. I knew\nexactly what Dad would do with it. He'd put it on telecast in\nBelsher's own voice.\n\nMaybe the monster-hunters would start looking around for a rope, then.\n\nWhen I got through listening to him, I went over and got a short\naudiovisual of Captain Marshak of the _Peenem\u00fcnde_ for the 'cast, and\nthen I rejoined Tom and Murell.\n\n\"Mr. Murell says he's staying with you at the _Times_,\" Tom said. He\nseemed almost as disappointed as Professor Hartzenbosch. I wondered,\nfor an incredulous moment, if Tom had been trying to kidnap Murell\naway from me. \"He wants to go out on the _Javelin_ with us for a\nmonster-hunt.\"\n\n\"Well, that's swell!\" I said. \"You can pay off on that promise to take\nme monster-hunting, too. Right now, Mr. Murell is my big story.\" I\nreached into the front pocket of my \"camera\" case for the handphone,\nto shift to two-way. \"I'll call the _Times_ and have somebody come up\nwith a car to get us and Mr. Murell's luggage.\"\n\n\"Oh, I have a car. Jeep, that is,\" Tom said. \"It's down on the Bottom\nLevel. We can use that.\"\n\nFunny place to leave a car. And I was sure that he and Murell had come\nto some kind of an understanding, while I was being lied to by\nBelsher. I didn't get it. There was just too much going on around me\nthat I didn't get, and me, I'm supposed to be the razor-sharp newshawk\nwho gets everything.\n\n\n\n\n3\n\nBOTTOM LEVEL\n\n\nIt didn't take long to get Murell's luggage assembled. There was\nsurprisingly little of it, and nothing that looked like photographic\nor recording equipment. When he returned from a final gathering-up in\nhis stateroom, I noticed that he was bulging under his jacket, too, on\nthe left side at the waist. About enough for an 8.5-mm pocket\nautomatic. Evidently he had been briefed on the law-and-order\nsituation in Port Sandor.\n\nNormally, we'd have gone off onto the Main City Level, but Tom's jeep\nwas down on the Bottom Level, and he made no suggestion that we go off\nand wait for him to bring it up. I didn't suggest it, either. After\nall, it was his jeep, and he wasn't our hired pilot. Besides, I was\nbeginning to get curious. An abnormally large bump of curiosity is\npart of every newsman's basic equipment.\n\nWe borrowed a small handling-lifter and one of the spaceport\nroustabouts to tow it for us, loaded Murell's luggage and my things\nonto it, and started down to the bottomside cargo hatches, from which\nthe ship was discharging. There was no cargo at all to go aboard,\nexcept mail and things like Adolf Lautier's old film and music tapes.\nOur only export is tallow-wax, and it all goes to Terra. It would be\npicked up by the Cape _Canaveral_ when she got in from Odin five\nhundred hours from now. But except for a few luxury items from Odin,\neverything we import comes from Terra, and the _Peenem\u00fcnde_ had\nstarted discharging that already. We rode down on a contragravity skid\nloaded with ammunition. I saw Murell looking curiously at the square\ncases, marked TERRAN FEDERATION ARMED FORCES, and 50-MM, MK. 608,\nANTIVEHICLE AND ANTIPERSONNEL, 25 ROUNDS, and OVERAGE. PRACTICE ONLY.\nNOT TO BE ISSUED FOR SERVICE, and INSPECTED AND CONDEMNED. The hunters\nbought that stuff through the Co-op. It cost half as much as new ammo,\nbut that didn't help them any. The difference stopped with Steve\nRavick. Murell didn't comment, and neither did Tom or I.\n\nWe got off at the bottom of the pit, a thousand feet below the\npromenade from which I had come aboard, and stopped for a moment.\nMurell was looking about the great amphitheater in amazement.\n\n\"I knew this spaceport would be big when I found out that the ship\nlanded directly on the planet,\" he said, \"but I never expected\nanything like this. And this serves a population of twenty thousand?\"\n\n\"Twenty-four thousand, seven hundred and eight, if the man who got\npounded in a barroom fight around 1330 hasn't died yet,\" I said. \"But\nyou have to remember that this place was built close to a hundred\nyears ago, when the population was ten times that much.\" I'd gotten my\nstory from him; now it was his turn to interview me. \"You know\nsomething about the history of Fenris, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Yes. There are ample sources for it on Terra, up to the collapse of\nthe Fenris Company,\" he said. \"Too much isn't known about what's been\nhappening here since, which is why I decided to do this book.\"\n\n\"Well, there were several cities built, over on the mainland,\" I told\nhim. \"They're all abandoned now. The first one was a conventional\ncity, the buildings all on the surface. After one day-and-night cycle,\nthey found that it was uninhabitable. It was left unfinished. Then\nthey started digging in. The Chartered Fenris Company shipped in huge\nquantities of mining and earth-moving equipment--that put the company\nin the red more than anything else--and they began making\nburrow-cities, like the ones built in the Northern Hemisphere of Terra\nduring the Third and Fourth World Wars, or like the cities on Luna and\nMercury Twilight Zone and Titan. There are a lot of valuable mineral\ndeposits over on the mainland; maybe in another century our\ngrandchildren will start working them again.\n\n\"But about six years before the Fenris Company went to pieces, they\ndecided to concentrate in one city, here in the archipelago. The sea\nwater stays cooler in the daytime and doesn't lose heat so rapidly in\nthe nighttime. So they built Port Sandor, here on Oakleaf Island.\"\n\n\"And for convenience in monster-hunting?\"\n\nI shook my head. \"No. The Jarvis's sea-monster wasn't discovered until\nafter the city was built, and it was years after the company had gone\nbankrupt before anybody found out about what tallow-wax was good\nfor.\"\n\nI started telling him about the native life-forms of Fenris. Because\nof the surface temperature extremes, the marine life is the most\nhighly developed. The land animals are active during the periods after\nsunset and after sunrise; when it begins getting colder or hotter,\nthey burrow, or crawl into caves and crevices among the rocks, and go\ninto suspended animation. I found that he'd read up on that, and not\ntoo much of his information was incorrect.\n\nHe seemed to think, though, that Port Sandor had also been mined out\nbelow the surface. I set him right on that.\n\n\"You saw what it looked like when you were coming down,\" I said. \"Just\na flat plateau, with a few shaft-head domes here and there, and the\nlanding pit of the spaceport. Well, originally it was a valley,\nbetween two low hills. The city was built in the valley, level by\nlevel, and then the tops of the hills were dug off and bulldozed down\non top of it. We have a lot of film at the public library of the\nconstruction of the city, step by step. As far as I know, there are no\ncopies anywhere off-planet.\"\n\nHe should have gotten excited about that, and wanted to see them.\nInstead, he was watching the cargo come off--food-stuffs, now--and\nwanted to know if we had to import everything we needed.\n\n\"Oh, no. We're going in on the Bottom Level, which is mainly storage,\nbut we have hydroponic farms for our vegetables and carniculture\nplants for meat on the Second and Third Levels. That's counting down\nfrom the Main City Level. We make our own lumber, out of reeds\nharvested in the swamps after sunrise and converted to pulpwood, and\nwe get some good hardwood from the native trees which only grow in\nfour periods of two hundred hours a year. We only use that for\nfurniture, gunstocks, that sort of thing. And there are a couple of\nmining camps and smelters on the mainland; they employ about a\nthousand of our people. But every millisol that's spent on this planet\nis gotten from the sale of tallow-wax, at second or third hand if not\ndirectly.\"\n\nThat seemed to interest him more. Maybe his book, if he was really\nwriting one, was going to be an economic study of Fenris. Or maybe his\nracket, whatever it was, would be based on something connected with\nour local production. I went on telling him about our hydroponic\nfarms, and the carniculture plant where any kind of animal tissue we\nwanted was grown--Terran pork and beef and poultry, Freyan _zhoumy_\nmeat, Zarathustran veldtbeest.... He knew, already, that none of the\nnative life-forms, animal or vegetable, were edible by Terrans.\n\n\"You can get all the _pat\u00e9 de foie gras_ you want here,\" I said. \"We\nhave a chunk of goose liver about fifty feet in diameter growing in\none of our vats.\"\n\nBy this time, we'd gotten across the bottom of the pit, Murell's\nluggage and my equipment being towed after us, and had entered the\nBottom Level. It was cool and pleasant here, lighted from the ceiling\nfifty feet overhead, among the great column bases, two hundred feet\nsquare and two hundred yards apart, that supported the upper city and\nthe thick roof of rock and earth that insulated it. The area we were\nentering was stacked with tallow-wax waiting to be loaded onto the\n_Cape Canaveral_ when she came in; it was vacuum-packed in plastic\nskins, like big half-ton Bologna sausages, each one painted with the\nblue and white emblem of the Hunters' Co-operative. He was quite\ninterested in that, and was figuring, mentally, how much wax there was\nhere and how much it was worth.\n\n\"Who does this belong to?\" he wanted to know. \"The Hunters'\nCo-operative?\"\n\nTom had been letting me do the talking up to now, but he answered that\nquestion, very emphatically.\n\n\"No, it doesn't. It belongs to the hunters,\" he said. \"Each ship crew\nowns the wax they bring in in common, and it's sold for them by the\nCo-op. When the captain gets paid for the wax he's turned over to the\nCo-op, he divides the money among the crew. But every scrap of this\nbelongs to the ships that took it, up till it's bought and paid for by\nKapstaad Chemical.\"\n\n\"Well, if a captain wants his wax back, after it's been turned over\nfor sale to the Co-op, can he get it?\" Murell asked.\n\n\"Absolutely!\"\n\nMurell nodded, and we went on. The roustabout who had been following\nus with the lifter had stopped to chat with a couple of his fellows.\nWe went on slowly, and now and then a vehicle, usually a lorry, would\npass above us. Then I saw Bish Ware, ahead, sitting on a sausage of\nwax, talking to one of the Spaceport Police. They were both smoking,\nbut that was all right. Tallow-wax will burn, and a wax fire is\nsomething to get really excited about, but the ignition point is 750\u00b0 C.,\nand that's a lot hotter than the end of anybody's cigar. He must\nhave come out the same way we did, and I added that to the\n\"wonder-why\" file. Pretty soon, I'd have so many questions to wonder\nabout that they'd start answering each other. He saw us and waved to\nus, and then suddenly the spaceport cop's face got as white as my\nshirt and he grabbed Bish by the arm. Bish didn't change color; he\njust shook off the cop's hand, got to his feet, dropped his cigar, and\ntook a side skip out into the aisle.\n\n\"Murell!\" he yelled. \"Freeze! On your life; don't move a muscle!\"\n\nThen there was a gun going off in his hand. I didn't see him reach for\nit, or where he drew it from. It was just in his hand, firing, and the\nempty brass flew up and came down on the concrete with a jingle on the\nheels of the report. We had all stopped short, and the roustabout who\nwas towing the lifter came hurrying up. Murell simply stood gaping at\nBish.\n\n\"All right,\" Bish said, slipping his gun back into a shoulder holster\nunder his coat. \"Step carefully to your left. Don't move right at\nall.\"\n\nMurell, still in a sort of trance, obeyed. As he did I looked past his\nright shin and saw what Bish had been shooting at. It was an irregular\ngray oval, about sixteen inches by four at its widest and tapering up\nin front to a cone about six inches high, into which a rodlike member,\ndarker gray, was slowly collapsing and dribbling oily yellow stuff.\nThe bullet had gone clear through and made a mess of dirty gray and\nblack and green body fluids on the concrete.\n\nIt was what we call a tread-snail, because it moves on a double row of\npads like stumpy feet and leaves a trail like a tractor. The\nfishpole-aerial thing it had erected out of its head was its stinger,\nand the yellow stuff was venom. A tenth of a milligram of it in your\nblood and it's \"Get the Gate open, St. Peter; here I come.\"\n\nTom saw it as soon as I did. His face got the same color as the cop's.\nI don't suppose mine looked any better. When Murell saw what had been\nbuddying up to him, I will swear, on a warehouse full of Bibles,\nKorans, Torah scrolls, Satanist grimoires, Buddhist prayer wheels and\nThoran Grandfather-God images, that his hair literally stood on end.\nI've heard that expression all my life; well, this time I really saw\nit happen. I mentioned that he seemed to have been reading up on the\nlocal fauna.\n\nI looked down at his right leg. He hadn't been stung--if he had, he\nwouldn't be breathing now--but he had been squirted, and there were a\ncouple of yellow stains on the cloth of his trouser leg. I told him to\nhold still, used my left hand to pull the cloth away from his leg, and\ngot out my knife and flipped it open with the other hand, cutting away\nthe poisoned cloth and dropping it on the dead snail.\n\nMurell started making an outcry about cutting up his trousers, and\nsaid he could have had them cleaned. Bish Ware, coming up, told him to\nstop talking like an imbecile.\n\n\"No cleaner would touch them, and even if they were cleaned, some of\nthe poison would remain in the fabric. Then, the next time you were\ncaught in the rain with a scratch on your leg, Walt, here, would\nwrite you one of his very nicest obituaries.\"\n\nThen he turned to the cop, who was gabbling into his belt radio, and\nsaid: \"Get an ambulance, quick. Possible case of tread-snail skin\npoisoning.\" A moment later, looking at Murell's leg, he added, \"Omit\n'possible.'\"\n\nThere were a couple of little spots on Murell's skin that were\nbeginning to turn raw-liver color. The raw poison hadn't gotten into\nhis blood, but some of it, with impurities, had filtered through the\ncloth, and he'd absorbed enough of it through his skin to make him\nseriously ill. The cop jabbered some more into the radio, and the\nlaborer with the lifter brought it and let it down, and Murell sat\ndown on his luggage. Tom lit a cigarette and gave it to him, and told\nhim to remain perfectly still. In a couple of minutes, an ambulance\nwas coming, its siren howling.\n\nThe pilot and his helper were both jackleg medics, at least as far as\nfirst aid. They gave him a drink out of a flask, smeared a lot of gunk\non the spots and slapped plasters over them, and helped him into the\nambulance, after I told him we'd take his things to the _Times_\nbuilding.\n\nBy this time, between the shot and the siren, quite a crowd had\ngathered, and everybody was having a nice little recrimination party.\nThe labor foreman was chewing the cop out. The warehouse\nsuperintendent was chewing him out. And somebody from the general\nsuperintendent's office was chewing out everybody indiscriminately,\nand at the same time mentioning to me that Mr. Fieschi, the\nsuperintendent, would be very much pleased if the _Times_ didn't\nmention the incident at all. I told him that was editorial policy,\nand to talk to Dad about it. Nobody had any idea how the thing had\ngotten in, but that wasn't much of a mystery. The Bottom Level is full\nof things like that; they can stay active all the time because the\ntemperature is constant. I supposed that eventually they'd pick the\ndumbest day laborer in the place and make him the patsy.\n\nTom stood watching the ambulance whisk Murell off, dithering in\nindecision. The poisoning of Murell seemed like an unexpected blow to\nhim. That fitted what I'd begun to think. Finally, he motioned the\nlaborer to pick up the lifter, and we started off toward where he had\nparked his jeep, outside the spaceport area.\n\nBish walked along with us, drawing his pistol and replacing the fired\nround in the magazine. I noticed that it was a 10-mm Colt-Argentine\nFederation Service, commercial type. There aren't many of those on\nFenris. A lot of 10-mm's, but mostly South African Sterbergs or\nVickers-Bothas, or Mars-Consolidated Police Specials. Mine, which I\nwasn't carrying at the moment, was a Sterberg 7.7-mm Olympic Match.\n\n\"You know,\" he said, sliding the gun back under his coat, \"I would be\njust as well pleased as Mr. Fieschi if this didn't get any publicity.\nIf you do publish anything about it, I wish you'd minimize my own part\nin it. As you have noticed, I have some slight proficiency with lethal\nhardware. This I would prefer not to advertise. I can usually avoid\ntrouble, but when I can't, I would like to retain the advantage of\nsurprise.\"\n\nWe all got into the jeep. Tom, not too graciously, offered to drop\nBish wherever he was going. Bish said he was going to the _Times_, so\nTom lifted the jeep and cut in the horizontal drive. We got into a\nbusy one-way aisle, crowded with lorries hauling food-stuffs to the\nrefrigeration area. He followed that for a short distance, and then\nturned off into a dimly lighted, disused area.\n\nBefore long, I began noticing stacks of tallow-wax, put up in the\nregular outside sausage skins but without the Co-op markings. They\njust had the names of hunter-ships--_Javelin_, _Bulldog_, _Helldiver_,\n_Slasher_, and so on.\n\n\"What's that stuff doing in here?\" I asked. \"It's a long way from the\ndocks, and a long way from the spaceport.\"\n\n\"Oh, just temporary storage,\" Tom said. \"It hasn't been checked in\nwith the Co-op yet.\"\n\nThat wasn't any answer--or maybe it was. I let it go at that. Then we\ncame to an open space about fifty feet square. There was a jeep, with\na 7-mm machine gun mounted on it, and half a dozen men in boat-clothes\nwere playing cards at a table made out of empty ammunition boxes. I\nnoticed they were all wearing pistols, and when a couple of them saw\nus, they got up and grabbed rifles. Tom let down and got out of the\njeep, going over and talking with them for a few minutes. What he had\nto tell them didn't seem to bring any noticeable amount of sunlight\ninto their lives. After a while he came back, climbed in at the\ncontrols, and lifted the jeep again.\n\n\n\n\n4\n\nMAIN CITY LEVEL\n\n\nThe ceiling on Main City Level is two hundred feet high; in order to\npermit free circulation of air and avoid traffic jams, nothing is\nbuilt higher than a hundred and fifty feet except the square\nbuildings, two hundred yards apart, which rest on foundations on the\nBottom Level and extend up to support the roof. The _Times_ has one of\nthese pillar-buildings, and we have the whole thing to ourselves. In a\ncity built for a quarter of a million, twenty thousand people don't\nhave to crowd very closely on one another. Naturally, we don't have a\ntop landing stage, but except for the buttresses at the corners and\nsolid central column, the whole street floor is open.\n\nTom hadn't said anything after we left the stacks of wax and the men\nguarding them. We came up a vehicle shaft a few blocks up Broadway,\nand he brought the jeep down and floated it in through one of the\narchways. As usual, the place was cluttered with equipment we hadn't\ngotten around to repairing or installing, merchandise we'd taken in\nexchange for advertising, and vehicles, our own and everybody else's.\nA couple of mechanics were tinkering on one of them. I decided, for\nthe oomptieth time, to do something about cleaning it up. Say in\nanother two or three hundred hours, when the ships would all be in\nport and work would be slack, and I could hire a couple of good men to\nhelp.\n\nWe got Murell's stuff off the jeep, and I hunted around till I found a\nhand-lifter.\n\n\"Want to stay and have dinner with us, Tom?\" I asked.\n\n\"Uh?\" It took him a second or so to realize what I'd said. \"Why, no,\nthanks, Walt. I have to get back to the ship. Father wants to see me\nbefore the meeting.\"\n\n\"How about you, Bish? Want to take potluck with us?\"\n\n\"I shall be delighted,\" he assured me.\n\nTom told us good-by absent-mindedly, lifted the jeep, and floated it\nout into the street. Bish and I watched him go; Bish looked as though\nhe had wanted to say something and then thought better of it. We\nfloated Murell's stuff and mine over to the elevator beside the\ncentral column, and I ran it up to the editorial offices on the top\nfloor.\n\nWe came out in a big room, half the area of the floor, full of\nworktables and radios and screens and photoprinting machines. Dad, as\nusual, was in a gray knee-length smock, with a pipe jutting out under\nhis ragged mustache, and, as usual, he was stopping every minute or so\nto relight it. He was putting together the stuff I'd transmitted in\nfor the audiovisual newscast. Over across the room, the rest of the\n_Times_ staff, Julio Kubanoff, was sitting at the composing machine,\nhis peg leg propped up and an earphone on, his fingers punching\nrapidly at the keyboard as he burned letters onto the white plastic\nsheet with ultraviolet rays for photographing. Julio was an old\nhunter-ship man who had lost a leg in an accident and taught himself\nhis new trade. He still wore the beard, now white, that was\npractically the monster-hunters' uniform.\n\n\"The stuff come in all right?\" I asked Dad, letting down the lifter.\n\n\"Yes. What do you think of that fellow Belsher?\" he asked. \"Did you\never hear such an impudent string of lies in your life?\" Then, out of\nthe corner of his eye, he saw the lifter full of luggage, and saw\nsomebody with me. \"Mr. Murell? Please excuse me for a moment, till I\nget this blasted thing together straight.\" Then he got the film\nspliced and the sound record matched, and looked up. \"Why, Bish?\nWhere's Mr. Murell, Walt?\"\n\n\"Mr. Murell has had his initiation to Fenris,\" I said. \"He got\nsquirted by a tread-snail almost as soon as he got off the ship. They\nhave him at the spaceport hospital; it'll be 2400 before they get all\nthe poison sweated out of him.\"\n\nI went on to tell him what had happened. Dad's eyes widened slightly,\nand he took the pipe out of his mouth and looked at Bish with\nsomething very reasonably like respect.\n\n\"That was mighty sharp work,\" he said. \"If you'd been a second slower,\nwe'd be all out of visiting authors. That would have been a nice\nbusiness; story would have gotten back to Terra, and been most\nunfortunate publicity for Fenris. And, of course,\" he afterthoughted,\n\"most unfortunate for Mr. Murell, too.\"\n\n\"Well, if you give this any publicity, I would rather you passed my\nown trifling exploit over in silence,\" Bish said. \"I gather the\nspaceport people wouldn't be too happy about giving the public the\nimpression that their area is teeming with tread-snails, either. They\nhave enough trouble hiring shipping-floor help as it is.\"\n\n\"But don't you want people to know what you did?\" Dad demanded,\nincredulously. Everybody wanted their names in print or on 'cast; that\nwas one of his basic articles of faith. \"If the public learned about\nthis--\" he went on, and then saw where he was heading and pulled up\nshort. It wouldn't be tactful to say something like, \"Maybe they\nwouldn't think you were just a worthless old soak.\"\n\nBish saw where Dad was heading, too, but he just smiled, as though he\nwere about to confer his episcopal blessing.\n\n\"Ah, but that would be a step out of character for me,\" he said. \"I\nmust not confuse my public. Just as a favor to me, Ralph, say nothing\nabout it.\"\n\n\"Well, if you'd rather I didn't.... Are you going to cover this\nmeeting at Hunters' Hall, tonight, Walt?\" he asked me.\n\n\"Would I miss it?\"\n\nHe frowned. \"I could handle that myself,\" he said. \"I'm afraid this\nmeeting's going to get a little rough.\"\n\nI shook my head. \"Let's face it, Dad,\" I said. \"I'm a little short of\neighteen, but you're sixty. I can see things coming better than you\ncan, and dodge them quicker.\"\n\nDad gave a rueful little laugh and looked at Bish.\n\n\"See how it goes?\" he asked. \"We spend our lives shielding our young\nand then, all of a sudden, we find they're shielding us.\" His pipe had\ngone out again and he relit it. \"Too bad you didn't get an audiovisual\nof Belsher making that idiotic statement.\"\n\n\"He didn't even know I was getting a voice-only. All the time he was\ntalking, I was doodling in a pad with a pencil.\"\n\n\"Synthetic substitutes!\" Dad snorted. \"Putting a synthetic tallow-wax\nmolecule together would be like trying to build a spaceship with a\njackknife and a tack hammer.\" He puffed hard on his pipe, and then\nexcused himself and went back to his work.\n\nEditing an audiovisual telecast is pretty much a one-man job. Bish\nwanted to know if he could be of assistance, but there was nothing\neither of us could do, except sit by and watch and listen. Dad handled\nthe Belsher thing by making a film of himself playing off the\nrecording, and interjecting sarcastic comments from time to time. When\nit went on the air, I thought, Ravick wasn't going to like it. I would\nhave to start wearing my pistol again. Then he made a tape on the\nlanding of the _Peenem\u00fcnde_ and the arrival of Murell, who he said had\nmet with a slight accident after leaving the ship. I took that over to\nJulio when Dad was finished, along with a tape on the announced\ntallow-wax price cut. Julio only grunted and pushed them aside. He was\nsetting up the story of the fight in Martian Joe's--a \"local bar,\" of\ncourse; nobody ever gets shot or stabbed or slashed or slugged in\nanything else. All the news _is_ fit to print, sure, but you can't\ngive your advertisers and teleprinter customers any worse name than\nthey have already. A paper has to use some judgment.\n\nThen Dad and Bish and I went down to dinner. Julio would have his a\nlittle later, not because we're too good to eat with the help but\nbecause, around 1830, the help is too busy setting up the next paper\nto eat with us. The dining room, which is also the library, living\nroom, and general congregating and loafing place, is as big as the\neditorial room above. Originally, it was an office, at a time when a\nlot of Fenris Company office work was being done here. Some of the\nfurniture is original, and some was made for us by local cabinetmakers\nout of native hardwood. The dining table, big enough for two ships'\ncrews to eat at, is an example of the latter. Then, of course, there\nare screens and microbook cabinets and things like that, and a\nrefrigerator to save going a couple of hundred feet to the pantry in\ncase anybody wants a snack.\n\nI went to that and opened it, and got out a bulb of concentrated fruit\njuice and a bottle of carbonated water. Dad, who seldom drinks, keeps\na few bottles around for guests. Seems most of our \"guests\" part with\ninformation easier if they have something like the locally made\nhydroponic potato schnapps inside them for courage.\n\n\"You drink Baldur honey-rum, don't you, Bish?\" he said, pawing among\nthe bottles in the liquor cabinet next to the refrigerator. \"I'm sure\nI have a bottle of it. Now wait a minute; it's here somewhere.\"\n\nWhen Dad passes on and some medium claims to have produced a spirit\ncommunication from him, I will not accept it as genuine without the\nexpression: \"Now wait a minute; it's here somewhere.\"\n\nBish wanted to know what I was fixing for myself, and I told him.\n\n\"Never mind the rum, Ralph. I believe,\" he said, \"that I shall join\nWalt in a fruit fizz.\"\n\nWell, whattaya know! Maybe my stealthy temperance campaign was having\nresults. Dad looked positively startled, and then replaced the bottle\nhe was holding.\n\n\"I believe I'll make it unanimous,\" he said. \"Fix me up a fruit fizz,\ntoo, Walt.\"\n\nI mixed two more fruit fizzes, and we carried them over to the table.\nBish sipped at his critically.\n\n\"Palatable,\" he pronounced it. \"Just a trifle on the mild side, but\ndefinitely palatable.\"\n\nDad looked at him as though he still couldn't believe the whole thing.\nDinner was slow coming. We finished our fizzes, and Bish and I both\nwanted repeats, and Dad felt that he had to go along. So I made three\nmore. We were finishing them when Mrs. Laden started bringing in the\ndinner. Mrs. Laden is a widow; she has been with us since my mother\ndied, the year after I was born. She is violently anti-liquor.\nReluctantly, she condones Dad taking a snort now and then, but as soon\nas she saw Bish Ware, her face started to stiffen.\n\nShe put the soup on the table and took off for the kitchen. She always\nhas her own dinner with Julio. That way, while they're eating he can\ntell her all the news that's fit to print, and all the gossip that\nisn't.\n\nFor the moment, the odd things I'd been noticing about our\ndistinguished and temporarily incapacitated visitor came under the\nlatter head. I told Dad and Bish about my observations, beginning with\nthe deafening silence about Glenn Murell at the library. Dad began\npopping immediately.\n\n\"Why, he must be an impostor!\" he exclaimed. \"What kind of a racket do\nyou think he's up to?\"\n\n\"Mmm-mm; I wouldn't say that, not right away,\" Bish said. \"In the\nfirst place, Murell may be his true name and he may publish under a\nnom de plume. I admit, some of the other items are a little\nsuspicious, but even if he isn't an author, he may have some\nlegitimate business here and, having heard a few stories about this\nplanetary Elysium, he may be exercising a little caution. Walt, tell\nyour father about that tallow-wax we saw, down in Bottom Level Fourth\nWard.\"\n\nI did, and while I was talking Dad sat with his soup spoon poised\nhalfway to his mouth for at least a minute before he remembered he was\nholding it.\n\n\"Now, that is funny,\" he said when I was through. \"Why do you\nsuppose...?\"\n\n\"Somebody,\" Bish said, \"some group of ship captains, is holding wax\nout from the Co-operative. There's no other outlet for it, so my guess\nis that they're holding it for a rise in price. There's only one way\nthat could happen, and that, literally, would be over Steve Ravick's\ndead body. It could be that they expect Steve's dead body to be around\nfor a price rise to come in over.\"\n\nI was expecting Dad to begin spouting law-and-order. Instead, he hit\nthe table with his fist; not, fortunately, the one that was holding\nthe soup spoon.\n\n\"Well, I hope so! And if they do it before the _Cape Canaveral_ gets\nin, they may fix Leo Belsher, too, and then, in the general\nexcitement, somebody might clobber Mort Hallstock, and that'd be grand\nslam. After the triple funeral, we could go to work on setting up an\nhonest co-operative and an honest government.\"\n\n\"Well, I never expected to hear you advocating lynch law, Dad,\" I\nsaid.\n\nHe looked at me for a few seconds.\n\n\"Tell the truth, Walt, neither did I,\" he admitted. \"Lynch law is a\nhorrible thing; don't make any mistake about that. But there's one\nthing more horrible, and that's no law at all. And that is the present\nsituation in Port Sandor.\n\n\"You know what the trouble is, here? We have no government. No legal\ngovernment, anyhow; no government under Federation law. We don't even\nhave a Federation Resident-Agent. Before the Fenris Company went\nbroke, it was the government here; when the Space Navy evacuated the\ncolonists, they evacuated the government along with them. The thousand\nwho remained were all too busy keeping alive to worry about that. They\ndidn't even care when Fenris was reclassified from Class III,\nuninhabited but inhabitable, to Class II, inhabitable only in\nartificial environment, like Mercury or Titan. And when Mort Hallstock\ngot hold of the town-meeting pseudo government they put together fifty\nyears ago and turned it into a dictatorship, nobody realized what had\nhappened till it was too late. Lynch law's the only recourse we have.\"\n\n\"Ralph,\" Bish told him, \"if anything like that starts, Belsher and\nHallstock and Ravick won't be the only casualties. Between Ravick's\ngoons and Hallstock's police, they have close to a hundred men. I\nwon't deny that they could be cleaned out, but it wouldn't be a\nlynching. It would be a civil war.\"\n\n\"Well, that's swell!\" Dad said. \"The Federation Government has never\npaid us any attention; the Federation planets are scattered over too\nmany million cubic light-years of space for the Government to run\naround to all of them wiping everybody's noses. As long as things are\nquiet here, they'll continue to do nothing for us. But let a story hit\nthe big papers on Terra, _Revolution Breaks Out on Fenris_--and\nthat'll be the story I'll send to Interworld News--and watch what\nhappens.\"\n\n\"I will tell you what will happen,\" Bish Ware said. \"A lot of people\nwill get killed. That isn't important, in itself. People are getting\nkilled all the time, in a lot worse causes. But these people will all\nhave friends and relatives who will take it up for them. Start killing\npeople here in a faction fight, and somebody will be shooting somebody\nin the back out of a dark passage a hundred years from now over it.\nYou want this planet poisoned with blood feuds for the next century?\"\n\nDad and I looked at one another. That was something that hadn't\noccurred to either of us, and it should have. There were feuds, even\nnow. Half the little settlements on the other islands and on the\nmainland had started when some group or family moved out of Port\nSandor because of the enmity of some larger and more powerful group or\nfamily, and half our shootings and knife fights grew out of old\ngrudges between families or hunting crews.\n\n\"We don't want it poisoned for the next century with the sort of thing\nMort Hallstock and Steve Ravick started here, either,\" Dad said.\n\n\"Granted.\" Bish nodded. \"If a civil war's the only possible way to get\nrid of them, that's what you'll have to have, I suppose. Only make\nsure you don't leave a single one of them alive when it's over. But if\nyou can get the Federation Government in here to clean the mess up,\nthat would be better. Nobody starts a vendetta with the Terran\nFederation.\"\n\n\"But how?\" Dad asked. \"I've sent story after story off about crime and\ncorruption on Fenris. They all get the file-and-forget treatment.\"\n\nMrs. Laden had taken away the soup plates and brought us our main\ncourse. Bish sat toying with his fork for a moment.\n\n\"I don't know what you can do,\" he said slowly. \"If you can stall off\nthe blowup till the _Cape Canaveral_ gets in, and you can send\nsomebody to Terra....\"\n\nAll of a sudden, it hit me. Here was something that would give Bish a\npurpose; something to make him want to stay sober.\n\n\"Well, don't say, 'If _you_ can,'\" I said. \"Say, 'If _we_ can.' You\nlive on Fenris, too, don't you?\"\n\n\n\n\n5\n\nMEETING OUT OF ORDER\n\n\nDad called the spaceport hospital, after dinner, and talked to Doc\nRojansky. Murell was asleep, and in no danger whatever. They'd given\nhim a couple of injections and a sedative, and his system was throwing\noff the poison satisfactorily. He'd be all right, but they thought he\nought to be allowed to rest at the hospital for a while.\n\nBy then, it was time for me to leave for Hunters' Hall. Julio and Mrs.\nLaden were having their dinner, and Dad and Bish went up to the\neditorial office. I didn't take a car. Hunters' Hall was only a half\ndozen blocks south of the Times, toward the waterfront. I carried my\nradio-under-false-pretense slung from my shoulder, and started\ndowntown on foot.\n\nThe business district was pretty well lighted, both from the ceiling\nand by the stores and restaurants. Most of the latter were in the\nopen, with small kitchen and storage buildings. At a table at one of\nthem I saw two petty officers from the _Peenem\u00fcnde_ with a couple of\ngirls, so I knew the ship wasn't leaving immediately. Going past the\nMunicipal Building, I saw some activity, and an unusually large number\nof police gathered around the vehicle port. Ravick must have his\ndoubts about how the price cut was going to be received, and Mort\nHallstock was mobilizing his storm troopers to give him support in\ncase he needed it. I called in about that, and Dad told me fretfully\nto be sure to stay out of trouble.\n\nHunters' Hall was a four-story building, fairly substantial as\nbuildings that don't have to support the roof go, with a landing stage\non top and a vehicle park underneath. As I came up, I saw a lot of\ncars and jeeps and ships' boats grounded in and around it, and a crowd\nof men, almost all of them in boat-clothes and wearing whiskers,\nincluding quite a few characters who had never been out in a\nhunter-ship in their lives but were members in the best of good\nstanding of the Co-operative. I also saw a few of Hallstock's\nuniformed thugs standing around with their thumbs in their gun belts\nor twirling their truncheons.\n\nI took an escalator up to the second floor, which was one big room,\nwith the escalators and elevators in the rear. It was the social room,\ndecorated with photos and models and solidigraphs of hunter-ships,\nphotos of record-sized monsters lashed alongside ships before\ncutting-up, group pictures of ships's crews, monster tusks, dried\nslashers and halberd fish, and a whole monster head, its tusked mouth\nopen. There was a big crowd there, too, at the bar, at the game\nmachines, or just standing around in groups talking.\n\nI saw Tom Kivelson and his father and Oscar Fujisawa, and went over to\njoin them. Joe Kivelson is just an outsize edition of his son, with a\nblond beard that's had thirty-five years' more growth. Oscar is\nskipper of the _Pequod_--he wouldn't have looked baffled if Bish Ware\ncalled him Captain Ahab--and while his family name is Old Terran\nJapanese, he had blue eyes and red hair and beard. He was almost as\nbig as Joe Kivelson.\n\n\"Hello, Walt,\" Joe greeted me. \"What's this Tom's been telling me\nabout Bish Ware shooting a tread-snail that was going to sting Mr.\nMurell?\"\n\n\"Just about that,\" I said. \"That snail must have crawled out from\nbetween two stacks of wax as we came up. We never saw it till it was\nall over. It was right beside Murell and had its stinger up when Bish\nshot it.\"\n\n\"He took an awful chance,\" Kivelson said. \"He might of shot Mr.\nMurell.\"\n\nI suppose it would look that way to Joe. He is the planet's worst\npistol shot, so according to him nobody can hit anything with a\npistol.\n\n\"He wouldn't have taken any chance not shooting,\" I said. \"If he\nhadn't, we'd have been running the Murell story with black borders.\"\n\nAnother man came up, skinny, red hair, sharp-pointed nose. His name\nwas Al Devis, and he was Joe Kivelson's engineer's helper. He wanted\nto know about the tread-snail shooting, so I had to go over it again.\nI hadn't anything to add to what Tom had told them already, but I was\nthe _Times_, and if the _Times_ says so it's true.\n\n\"Well, I wouldn't want any drunk like Bish Ware shooting around me\nwith a pistol,\" Joe Kivelson said.\n\nThat's relative, too. Joe doesn't drink.\n\n\"Don't kid yourself, Joe,\" Oscar told him. \"I saw Bish shoot a knife\nout of a man's hand, one time, in One Eye Swanson's. Didn't scratch\nthe guy; hit the blade. One Eye has the knife, with the bullet mark on\nit, over his back bar, now.\"\n\n\"Well, was he drunk then?\" Joe asked.\n\n\"Well, he had to hang onto the bar with one hand while he fired with\nthe other.\" Then he turned to me. \"How is Murell, now?\" he asked.\n\nI told him what the hospital had given us. Everybody seemed much\nrelieved. I wouldn't have thought that a celebrated author of whom\nnobody had ever heard before would be the center of so much interest\nin monster-hunting circles. I kept looking at my watch while we were\ntalking. After a while, the Times newscast came on the big screen\nacross the room, and everybody moved over toward it.\n\nThey watched the _Peenem\u00fcnde_ being towed down and berthed, and the\naudiovisual interview with Murell. Then Dad came on the screen with a\nrecord player in front of them, and gave them a play-off of my\ninterview with Leo Belsher.\n\nOrdinary bad language I do not mind. I'm afraid I use a little myself,\nwhile struggling with some of the worn-out equipment we have at the\npaper. But when Belsher began explaining about how the price of wax\nhad to be cut again, to thirty-five centisols a pound, the language\nthose hunters used positively smelled. I noticed, though, that a lot\nof the crowd weren't saying anything at all. They would be Ravick's\nboys, and they would have orders not to start anything before the\nmeeting.\n\n\"Wonder if he's going to try to give us that stuff about substitutes?\"\nOscar said.\n\n\"Well, what are you going to do?\" I asked.\n\n\"I'll tell you what we're not going to do,\" Joe Kivelson said. \"We're\nnot going to take his price cut. If he won't pay our price, he can use\nhis [deleted by censor] substitutes.\"\n\n\"You can't sell wax anywhere else, can you?\"\n\n\"Is that so, we can't?\" Joe started.\n\nBefore he could say anything else, Oscar was interrupting:\n\n\"We can eat for a while, even if we don't sell wax. Sigurd Ngozori'll\ncarry us for a while and make loans on wax. But if the wax stops\ncoming in, Kapstaad Chemical's going to start wondering why....\"\n\nBy this time, other _Javelin_ men came drifting over--Ram\u00f3n Llewellyn,\nthe mate, and Abdullah Monnahan, the engineer, and Abe Clifford, the\nnavigator, and some others. I talked with some of them, and then\ndrifted off in the direction of the bar, where I found another hunter\ncaptain, Mohandas Gandhi Feinberg, whom everybody simply called the\nMahatma. He didn't resemble his namesake. He had a curly black beard\nwith a twisted black cigar sticking out of it, and nobody, after one\nlook at him, would have mistaken him for any apostle of nonviolence.\n\nHe had a proposition he was enlisting support for. He wanted balloting\nat meetings to be limited to captains of active hunter-ships, the\ncaptains to vote according to expressed wishes of a majority of their\ncrews. It was a good scheme, though it would have sounded better if\nthe man who was advocating it hadn't been a captain himself. At least,\nit would have disenfranchised all Ravick's permanently unemployed\n\"unemployed hunters.\" The only trouble was, there was no conceivable\nway of getting it passed. It was too much like trying to curtail the\npowers of Parliament by act of Parliament.\n\nThe gang from the street level started coming up, and scattered in\ntwos and threes around the hall, ready for trouble. I'd put on my\nradio when I'd joined the Kivelsons and Oscar, and I kept it on,\ncirculating around and letting it listen to the conversations. The\nRavick people were either saying nothing or arguing that Belsher was\ndoing the best he could, and if Kapstaad wouldn't pay more than\nthirty-five centisols, it wasn't his fault. Finally, the call bell for\nthe meeting began clanging, and the crowd began sliding over toward\nthe elevators and escalators.\n\nThe meeting room was on the floor above, at the front of the building,\nbeyond a narrow hall and a door at which a couple of Ravick henchmen\nwearing guns and sergeant-at-arms brassards were making everybody\ncheck their knives and pistols. They passed me by without getting my\narsenal, which consisted of a sleep-gas projector camouflaged as a\njumbo-sized lighter and twenty sols in two rolls of forty quarter sols\neach. One of these inside a fist can make a big difference.\n\nRavick and Belsher and the secretary of the Co-op, who was a little\nscrawny henpecked-husband type who never had an opinion of his own in\nhis life, were all sitting back of a big desk on a dais in front.\nAfter as many of the crowd who could had found seats and the rest,\nincluding the Press, were standing in the rear, Ravick pounded with\nthe chunk of monster tusk he used for a gavel and called the meeting\nto order.\n\n\"There's a bunch of old business,\" he said, \"but I'm going to rule\nthat aside for the moment. We have with us this evening our\nrepresentative on Terra, Mr. Leo Belsher, whom I wish to present. Mr.\nBelsher.\"\n\nBelsher got up. Ravick started clapping his hands to indicate that\napplause was in order. A few of his zombies clapped their hands;\neverybody else was quiet. Belsher held up a hand.\n\n\"Please don't applaud,\" he begged. \"What I have to tell you isn't\nanything to applaud about.\"\n\n\"You're tootin' well right it isn't!\" somebody directly in front of me\nsaid, very distinctly.\n\n\"I'm very sorry to have to bring this news to you, but the fact is\nthat Kapstaad Chemical Products, Ltd., is no longer able to pay\nforty-five centisols a pound. This price is being scaled down to\nthirty-five centisols. I want you to understand that Kapstaad Chemical\nwants to give you every cent they can, but business conditions no\nlonger permit them to pay the old price. Thirty-five is the absolute\nmaximum they can pay and still meet competition--\"\n\n\"Aaah, knock it off, Belsher!\" somebody shouted. \"We heard all that\nrot on the screen.\"\n\n\"How about our contract?\" somebody else asked. \"We do have a contract\nwith Kapstaad, don't we?\"\n\n\"Well, the contract will have to be re-negotiated. They'll pay\nthirty-five centisols or they'll pay nothing.\"\n\n\"They can try getting along without wax. Or try buying it somewhere\nelse!\"\n\n\"Yes; those wonderful synthetic substitutes!\"\n\n\"Mr. Chairman,\" Oscar Fujisawa called out. \"I move that this\norganization reject the price of thirty-five centisols a pound for\ntallow-wax, as offered by, or through, Leo Belsher at this meeting.\"\n\nRavick began clamoring that Oscar was out of order, that Leo Belsher\nhad the floor.\n\n\"I second Captain Fujisawa's motion,\" Mohandas Feinberg said.\n\n\"And Leo Belsher doesn't have the floor; he's not a member of the\nCo-operative,\" Tom Kivelson declared. \"He's our hired employee, and as\nsoon as this present motion is dealt with, I intend moving that we\nfire him and hire somebody else.\"\n\n\"I move to amend Captain Fujisawa's motion,\" Joe Kivelson said. \"I\nmove that the motion, as amended, read, '--and stipulate a price of\nseventy-five centisols a pound.'\"\n\n\"You're crazy!\" Belsher almost screamed.\n\nSeventy-five was the old price, from which he and Ravick had been\nreducing until they'd gotten down to forty-five.\n\nJust at that moment, my radio began making a small fuss. I unhooked\nthe handphone and brought it to my face.\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\nIt was Bish Ware's voice: \"Walt, get hold of the Kivelsons and get\nthem out of Hunters' Hall as fast as you can,\" he said. \"I just got a\ntip from one of my ... my parishioners. Ravick's going to stage a riot\nto give Hallstock's cops an excuse to raid the meeting. They want the\nKivelsons.\"\n\n\"Roger.\" I hung up, and as I did I could hear Joe Kivelson shouting:\n\n\"You think we don't get any news on this planet? Tallow-wax has been\nselling for the same price on Terra that it did eight years ago, when\nyou two crooks started cutting the price. Why, the very ship Belsher\ncame here on brought the quotations on the commodity market--\"\n\nI edged through the crowd till I was beside Oscar Fujisawa. I decided\nthe truth would need a little editing; I didn't want to use Bish Ware\nas my source.\n\n\"Oscar, Dad just called me,\" I told him. \"A tip came in to the Times\nthat Ravick's boys are going to fake a riot and Hallstock's cops are\ngoing to raid the meeting. They want Joe and Tom. You know what\nthey'll do if they get hold of them.\"\n\n\"Shot while resisting arrest. You sure this is a good tip, though?\"\n\nAcross the room, somebody jumped to his feet, kicking over a chair.\n\n\"That's a double two-em-dashed lie, you etaoin shrdlu so-and-so!\"\nsomebody yelled.\n\n\"Who are you calling a so-and-so, you thus-and-so-ing such-and-such?\"\nsomebody else yelled back, and a couple more chairs got smashed and a\nswirl of fighting started.\n\n\"Yes, it is,\" Oscar decided. \"Let's go.\"\n\nWe started plowing through the crowd toward where the Kivelsons and a\ncouple more of the _Javelin_ crew were clumped. I got one of the rolls\nof quarter sols into my right fist and let Oscar go ahead. He has more\nmass than I have.\n\nIt was a good thing I did, because before we had gone ten feet, some\ncharacter got between us, dragged a two-foot length of inch-and-a-half\nhigh-pressure hose out of his pant leg, and started to swing at the\nback of Oscar's head. I promptly clipped him behind the ear with a\nfist full of money, and down he went. Oscar, who must have eyes in\nthe back of his head, turned and grabbed the hose out of his hand\nbefore he dropped it, using it to clout somebody in front of him.\nSomebody else came pushing toward us, and I was about to clip him,\ntoo, when he yelled, \"Watch it, Walt; I'm with it!\" It was Ces\u00e1rio\nVieira, another _Javelin_ man; he's engaged to Linda Kivelson, Joe's\ndaughter and Tom's sister, the one going to school on Terra.\n\nThen we had reached Tom and Joe Kivelson. Oscar grabbed Joe by the\narm.\n\n\"Come on, Joe; let's get moving,\" he said. \"Hallstock's Gestapo are on\nthe way. They have orders to get you dead or alive.\"\n\n\"Like blazes!\" Joe told him. \"I never chickened out on a fight yet,\nand--\"\n\nThat's what I'd been afraid of. Joe is like a Zarathustra veldtbeest;\nthe only tactics he knows is a headlong attack.\n\n\"You want to get your crew and your son killed, and yourself along\nwith them?\" Oscar asked him. \"That's what'll happen if the cops catch\nyou. Now are you coming, or will I have to knock you senseless and\ndrag you out?\"\n\nFortunately, at that moment somebody took a swing at Joe and grazed\nhis cheek. It was a good thing that was all he did; he was wearing\nbrass knuckles. Joe went down a couple of feet, bending at the knees,\nand caught this fellow around the hips with both hands, straightening\nand lifting him over his head. Then he threw him over the heads of the\npeople in front of him. There were yells where the human missile\nlanded.\n\n\"That's the stuff, Joe!\" Oscar shouted. \"Come on, we got them on the\nrun!\"\n\nThat, of course, converted a strategic retreat into an attack. We got\nJoe aimed toward the doors and before he knew it, we were out in the\nhall by the elevators. There were a couple of Ravick's men, with\nsergeant-at-arms arm bands, and two city cops. One of the latter got\nin Joe's way. Joe punched him in the face and knocked him back about\nten feet in a sliding stagger before he dropped. The other cop grabbed\nme by the left arm.\n\nI slugged him under the jaw with my ten-sol right and knocked him out,\nand I felt the wrapping on the coin roll break and the quarters come\nloose in my hand. Before I could drop them into my jacket pocket and\nget out the other roll, one of the sergeants at arms drew a gun. I\njust hurled the handful of coins at him. He dropped the pistol and put\nboth hands to his face, howling in pain.\n\nI gave a small mental howl myself when I thought of all the nice\nthings I could have bought for ten sols. One of Joe Kivelson's\nfollowers stooped and scooped up the fallen pistol, firing a couple of\ntimes with it. Then we all rushed Joe into one of the elevators and\ncrowded in behind him, and as I turned to start it down I could hear\npolice sirens from the street and also from the landing stage above.\nIn the hall outside the meeting room, four or five of Ravick's\nfree-drink mercenaries were down on all fours scrabbling for coins,\nand the rest of the pursuers from the meeting room were stumbling and\ntripping over them. I wished I'd brought a camera along, too. The\npublic would have loved a shot of that. I lifted the radio and spoke\ninto it:\n\n\"This is Walter Boyd, returning you now to the regular entertainment\nprogram.\"\n\nA second later, the thing whistled at me. As the car started down and\nthe doors closed I lifted the handphone. It was Bish Ware again.\n\n\"We're going down in the elevator to Second Level Down,\" I said. \"I\nhave Joe and Tom and Oscar Fujisawa and a few of the _Javelin_ crew\nwith me. The place is crawling with cops now.\"\n\n\"Go to Third Level Down and get up on the catwalk on the right,\" Bish\nsaid. \"I'll be along to pick you up.\"\n\n\"Roger. We'll be looking for you.\"\n\nThe car stopped at Second Level Down. I punched a button and sent it\ndown another level. Joe Kivelson, who was dabbing at his cheek with a\npiece of handkerchief tissue, wanted to know what was up.\n\n\"We're getting a pickup,\" I told him. \"Vehicle from the _Times_.\"\n\nI thought it would save arguments if I didn't mention who was bringing\nit.\n\n\n\n\n6\n\nELEMENTARY, MY DEAR KIVELSON\n\n\nBefore we left the lighted elevator car, we took a quick nose count.\nBesides the Kivelsons, there were five _Javelin_ men--Ram\u00f3n Llewellyn,\nAbdullah Monnahan, Abe Clifford, Ces\u00e1rio Vieira, and a whitebeard\nnamed Piet Dumont. Al Devis had been with us when we crashed the door\nout of the meeting room, but he'd fallen by the way. We had a couple\nof flashlights, so, after sending the car down to Bottom Level, we\npicked our way up the zigzag iron stairs to the catwalk, under the\nseventy-foot ceiling, and sat down in the dark.\n\nJoe Kivelson was fretting about what would happen to the rest of his\nmen.\n\n\"Fine captain I am, running out and leaving them!\"\n\n\"If they couldn't keep up, that's their tough luck,\" Oscar Fujisawa\ntold him. \"You brought out all you could. If you'd waited any longer,\nnone of us would have gotten out.\"\n\n\"They won't bother with them,\" I added. \"You and Tom and Oscar, here,\nare the ones they want.\"\n\nJoe was still letting himself be argued into thinking he had done the\nright thing when we saw the lights of a lorry coming from uptown at\nceiling level. A moment later, it backed to the catwalk, and Bish Ware\nstuck his head out from the pilot's seat.\n\n\"Where do you gentlemen wish to go?\" he asked.\n\n\"To the _Javelin_,\" Joe said instantly.\n\n\"Huh-uh,\" Oscar disagreed. \"That's the first place they'll look.\nThat'll be all right for Ram\u00f3n and the others, but if they catch you\nand Tom, they'll shoot you and call it self-defense, or take you in\nand beat both of you to a jelly. This'll blow over in fifteen or\ntwenty hours, but I'm not going anywhere near my ship, now.\"\n\n\"Drop us off on Second Level Down, about Eighth Street and a couple of\nblocks from the docks,\" the mate, Llewellyn, said. \"We'll borrow some\nweapons from Patel the Pawnbroker and then circulate around and see\nwhat's going on. But you and Joe and Oscar had better go underground\nfor a while.\"\n\n\"The _Times_,\" I said. \"We have a whole pillar-building to ourselves;\nwe could hide half the population.\"\n\nThat was decided upon. We all piled into the lorry, and Bish took it\nto an inconspicuous place on the Second Level and let down. Ram\u00f3n\nLlewellyn and the others got out. Then we went up to Main City Level.\nWe passed within a few blocks of Hunters' Hall. There was a lot of\nnoise, but no shooting.\n\nJoe Kivelson didn't have anything to say, on the trip, but he kept\nlooking at the pilot's seat in perplexity and apprehension. I think\nhe expected Bish to try to ram the lorry through every building we\npassed by or over.\n\nWe found Dad in the editorial department on the top floor, feeding\nvoice-tape to Julio while the latter made master sheets for\nteleprinting. I gave him a quick rundown on what had happened that he\nhadn't gotten from my radio. Dad cluck-clucked in disapproval, either\nat my getting into a fight, assaulting an officer, or, literally,\nthrowing money away.\n\nBish Ware seemed a little troubled. \"I think,\" he said, \"that I shall\nmake a circuit of my diocese, and see what can be learned from my\ndevoted flock. Should I turn up anything significant, I will call it\nin.\"\n\nWith that, he went tottering over to the elevator, stumbling on the\nway and making an unepiscopal remark. I watched him, and then turned\nto Dad.\n\n\"Did he have anything to drink after I left?\" I asked.\n\n\"Nothing but about five cups of coffee.\"\n\nI mentally marked that: _Add oddities, Bish Ware._ He'd been at least\nfour hours without liquor, and he was walking as unsteadily as when\nI'd first seen him at the spaceport. I didn't know any kind of liquor\nthat would persist like that.\n\nJulio had at least an hour's tape to transcribe, so Dad and Joe and\nTom and Oscar and I went to the living room on the floor below. Joe\nwas still being bewildered about Bish Ware.\n\n\"How'd he manage to come for us?\" he wanted to know.\n\n\"Why, he was here with me all evening,\" Dad said. \"He came from the\nspaceport with Walt and Tom, and had dinner with us. He called a few\npeople from here, and found out about the fake riot and police raid\nRavick had cooked up. You'd be surprised at how much information he\ncan pick up around town.\"\n\nJoe looked at his son, alarmed.\n\n\"Hey! You let him see--\" he began.\n\n\"The wax on Bottom Level, in the Fourth Ward?\" I asked. \"He won't blab\nabout that. He doesn't blab things where they oughtn't be blabbed.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Dad backed me up. He was beginning to think of Bish as\none of the _Times_ staff, now. \"We got a lot of tips from him, but\nnothing we give him gets out.\" He got his pipe lit again. \"What about\nthat wax, Joe?\" he asked. \"Were you serious when you made that motion\nabout a price of seventy-five centisols?\"\n\n\"I sure was!\" Joe declared. \"That's the real price, and always has\nbeen, and that's what we get or Kapstaad doesn't get any more wax.\"\n\n\"If Murell can top it, maybe Kapstaad won't get any more wax, period,\"\nI said. \"Who's he with--Interstellar Import-Export?\"\n\nAnybody would have thought a barbwire worm had crawled onto Joe\nKivelson's chair seat under him.\n\n\"Where'd you hear that?\" he demanded, which is the Galaxy's silliest\nquestion to ask any newsman. \"Tom, if you've been talking--\"\n\n\"He hasn't,\" I said. \"He didn't need to. It sticks out a parsec in all\ndirections.\" I mentioned some of the things I'd noticed while\ninterviewing Murell, and his behavior after leaving the ship. \"Even\nbefore I'd talked to him, I wondered why Tom was so anxious to get\naboard with me. He didn't know we'd arranged to put Murell up here; he\nwas going to take him to see that wax, and then take him to the\n_Javelin_. You were going to produce him at the meeting and have him\nbid against Belsher, only that tread-snail fouled your lines for you.\nSo then you thought you had to stall off a new contract till he got\nout of the hospital.\"\n\nThe two Kivelsons and Oscar Fujisawa were looking at one another; Joe\nand Tom in consternation, and Oscar in derision of both of them. I was\nfeeling pretty good. Brother, I thought, Sherlock Holmes never did\nbetter, himself.\n\nThat, all of a sudden, reminded me of Dr. John Watson, whom Bish\nperceived to have been in Afghanistan. That was one thing Sherlock H.\nBoyd hadn't deduced any answers for. Well, give me a little more time.\nAnd more data.\n\n\"You got it all figured out, haven't you?\" Joe was asking\nsarcastically. The sarcasm was as hollow as an empty oil drum.\n\n\"The _Times_,\" Dad was saying, trying not to sound too proud, \"has a\nvery sharp reportorial staff, Joe.\"\n\n\"It isn't Interstellar,\" Oscar told me, grinning. \"It's Argentine\nExotic Organics. You know, everybody thought Joe, here, was getting\npretty high-toned, sending his daughter to school on Terra. School\nwasn't the only thing she went for. We got a letter from her, the last\ntime the Cape Canaveral was in, saying that she'd contacted Argentine\nOrganics and that a man was coming out on the _Peenem\u00fcnde_, posing as\na travel-book author. Well, he's here, now.\"\n\n\"You'd better keep an eye on him,\" I advised. \"If Steve Ravick gets\nto him, he won't be much use to you.\"\n\n\"You think Ravick would really harm Murell?\" Dad asked.\n\nHe thought so, too. He was just trying to comfort himself by\npretending he didn't.\n\n\"What do you think, Ralph?\" Oscar asked him. \"If we get competitive\nwax buying, again, seventy-five a pound will be the starting price.\nI'm not spending the money till I get it, but I wouldn't be surprised\nto see wax go to a sol a pound on the loading floor here. And you know\nwhat that would mean.\"\n\n\"Thirty for Steve Ravick,\" Dad said. That puzzled Oscar, till I\nexplained that \"thirty\" is newsese for \"the end.\" \"I guess Walt's\nright. Ravick would do anything to prevent that.\" He thought for a\nmoment. \"Joe, you were using the wrong strategy. You should have let\nRavick get that thirty-five centisol price established for the\nCo-operative, and then had Murell offer seventy-five or something like\nthat.\"\n\n\"You crazy?\" Joe demanded. \"Why, then the Co-op would have been stuck\nwith it.\"\n\n\"That's right. And as soon as Murell's price was announced, everybody\nwould drop out of the Co-operative and reclaim their wax, even the\ncaptains who owe Ravick money. He'd have nobody left but a handful of\nthugs and barflies.\"\n\n\"But that would smash the Co-operative,\" Joe Kivelson objected.\n\"Listen, Ralph; I've been in the Co-operative all my life, since\nbefore Steve Ravick was heard of on this planet. I've worked hard for\nthe Co-operative, and--\"\n\nYou didn't work hard enough, I thought. You let Steve Ravick take it\naway from you. Dad told Joe pretty much the same thing:\n\n\"You don't have a Co-operative, Joe. Steve Ravick has a racket. The\nonly thing you can do with this organization is smash it, and then\nrebuild it with Ravick and his gang left out.\"\n\nJoe puzzled over that silently. He'd been thinking that it was the\nsame Co-operative his father and Simon MacGregor and the other old\nhunters had organized, and that getting rid of Ravick was simply a\nmatter of voting him out. He was beginning to see, now, that\nparliamentary procedure wasn't any weapon against Ravick's force and\nfraud and intimidation.\n\n\"I think Walt has something,\" Oscar Fujisawa said. \"As long as\nMurell's in the hospital at the spaceport, he's safe, but as soon as\nhe gets out of Odin Dock & Shipyard territory, he's going to be a clay\npigeon.\"\n\nTom hadn't been saying anything. Now he cleared his throat.\n\n\"On the _Peenem\u00fcnde_, I was talking about taking Mr. Murell for a trip\nin the _Javelin_,\" he said. \"That was while we were still pretending\nhe'd come here to write a book. Maybe that would be a good idea,\nanyhow.\"\n\n\"It's a cinch we can't let him get killed on us,\" his father said. \"I\ndoubt if Exotic Organics would send anybody else out, if he was.\"\n\n\"Here,\" Dad said. \"We'll run the story we have on him in the morning\nedition, and then correct it and apologize to the public for\nmisleading them and explain in the evening edition. And before he\ngoes, we can have him make an audiovisual for the 'cast, telling\neverybody who he is and announcing the price he's offering. We'll put\nthat on the air. Get enough publicity, and Steve Ravick won't dare do\nanything to him.\"\n\nPublicity, I thought, is the only weapon Dad knows how to use. He\nthinks it's invincible. Me, I wouldn't bet on what Steve Ravick\nwouldn't dare do if you gave me a hundred to one. Ravick had been in\npower too long, and he was drunker on it than Bish Ware ever got on\nBaldur honey-rum. As an intoxicant, rum is practically a soft drink\nbeside power.\n\n\"Well, do you think Ravick's gotten onto Murell yet?\" Oscar said. \"We\nkept that a pretty close secret. Joe and I knew about him, and so did\nthe Mahatma and Nip Spazoni and Corkscrew Finnegan, and that was all.\"\n\n\"I didn't even tell Tom, here, till the _Peenem\u00fcnde_ got into radio\nrange,\" Joe Kivelson said. \"Then I only told him and Ram\u00f3n and\nAbdullah and Abe and Hans Cronje.\"\n\n\"And Al Devis,\" Tom added. \"He came into the conning tower while you\nwere telling the rest of us.\"\n\nThe communication screen began buzzing, and I went and put it on. It\nwas Bish Ware, calling from a pay booth somewhere.\n\n\"I have some early returns,\" he said. \"The cops cleared everybody out\nof Hunters' Hall except the Ravick gang. Then Ravick reconvened the\nmeeting, with nobody but his gang. They were very careful to make sure\nthey had enough for a legal quorum under the bylaws, and then they\nvoted to accept the new price of thirty-five centisols a pound.\"\n\n\"That's what I was afraid of,\" Joe Kivelson said. \"Did they arrest any\nof my crew?\"\n\n\"Not that I know of,\" Bish said. \"They made a few arrests, but turned\neverybody loose later. They're still looking for you and your son. As\nfar as I know, they aren't interested in anybody else.\" He glanced\nhastily over his shoulder, as though to make sure the door of the\nbooth was secure. \"I'm with some people, now. I'll call you back\nlater.\"\n\n\"Well, that's that, Joe,\" Oscar said, after Bish blanked the screen.\n\"The Ravick Co-op's stuck with the price cut. The only thing left to\ndo is get everybody out of it we can, and organize a new one.\"\n\n\"I guess that's so,\" Joe agreed. \"I wonder, though if Ravick has\nreally got wise to Murell.\"\n\n\"Walt figured it out since the ship got in,\" Oscar said. \"Belsher's\nbeen on the ship with Murell for six months. Well, call it three;\neverything speeds up about double in hyperspace. But in three months\nhe ought to see as much as Walt saw in a couple of hours.\"\n\n\"Well, maybe Belsher doesn't know what's suspicious, the way Walt\ndoes,\" Tom said.\n\n\"I'm sure he doesn't,\" I said. \"But he and Murell are both in the wax\nbusiness. I'll bet he noticed dozens of things I never even saw.\"\n\n\"Then we'd better take awfully good care of Mr. Murell,\" Tom said.\n\"Get him aboard as fast as we can, and get out of here with him. Walt,\nyou're coming along, aren't you?\"\n\nThat was what we'd agreed, while Glenn Murell was still the famous\ntravel-book author. I wanted to get out of it, now. There wouldn't be\nanything happening aboard the _Javelin_, and a lot happening here in\nPort Sandor. Dad had the same idea, only he was one hundred per cent\nfor my going with Murell. I think he wanted me out of Port Sandor,\nwhere I wouldn't get in the way of any small high-velocity particles\nof lead that might be whizzing around.\n\n\n\n\n7\n\nABOARD THE _JAVELIN_\n\n\nWe heard nothing more from Bish Ware that evening. Joe and Tom\nKivelson and Oscar Fujisawa slept at the _Times_ Building, and after\nbreakfast Dad called the spaceport hospital about Murell. He had\npassed a good night and seemed to have thrown off all the poison he\nhad absorbed through his skin. Dad talked to him, and advised him not\nto leave until somebody came for him. Tom and I took a car--and a\npistol apiece and a submachine gun--and went to get him. Remembering,\nat the last moment, what I had done to his trousers, I unpacked his\nluggage and got another suit for him.\n\nHe was grateful for that, and he didn't lift an eyebrow when he saw\nthe artillery we had with us. He knew, already, what the score was,\nand the rules, or absence thereof, of the game, and accepted us as\nmembers of his team. We dropped to the Bottom Level and went, avoiding\ntraffic, to where the wax was stored. There were close to a dozen\nguards there now, all heavily armed.\n\nWe got out of the car, I carrying the chopper, and one of the gang\nthere produced a probe rod and microscope and a testing kit and a\nmicroray scanner. Murell took his time going over the wax, jabbing the\nprobe rod in and pulling samples out of the big plastic-skinned\nsausages at random, making chemical tests, examining them under the\nmicroscope, and scanning other cylinders to make sure there was no\nforeign matter in them. He might not know what a literary agent was,\nbut he knew tallow-wax.\n\nI found out from the guards that there hadn't been any really serious\ntrouble after we left Hunter's Hall. The city police had beaten a few\nmen up, natch, and run out all the anti-Ravick hunters, and then\nRavick had reconvened the meeting and acceptance of the thirty-five\ncentisol price had been voted unanimously. The police were still\nlooking for the Kivelsons. Ravick seemed to have gotten the idea that\nJoe Kivelson was the mastermind of the hunters' cabal against him. I\nknow if I'd found that Joe Kivelson and Oscar Fujisawa were in any\nkind of a conspiracy together, I wouldn't pick Joe for the mastermind.\nIt was just possible, I thought, that Oscar had been fostering this\nhimself, in case anything went wrong. After all, self-preservation is\nthe first law, and Oscar is a self-preserving type.\n\nAfter Murell had finished his inspection and we'd gotten back in the\ncar and were lifting, I asked him what he was going to offer, just as\nthough I were the skipper of the biggest ship out of Port Sandor.\nWell, it meant as much to us as it did to the hunters. The more wax\nsold for, the more advertising we'd sell to the merchants, and the\nmore people would rent teleprinters from us.\n\n\"Eighty centisols a pound,\" he said. Nice and definite; quite a\ndifference from the way he stumbled around over listing his previous\npublications. \"Seventy-five's the Kapstaad price, regardless of what\nyou people here have been getting from that crook of a Belsher. We'll\nhave to go far enough beyond that to make him have to run like blazes\nto catch up. You can put it in the _Times_ that the day of\nmonopolistic marketing on Fenris is over.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen we got back to the _Times_, I asked Dad if he'd heard anything\nmore from Bish.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said unhappily. \"He didn't call in, this morning, so I\ncalled his apartment and didn't get an answer. Then I called Harry\nWong's. Harry said Bish had been in there till after midnight, with\nsome other people.\" He named three disreputables, two female and one\nmale. \"They were drinking quite a lot. Harry said Bish was plastered\nto the ears. They finally went out, around 0130. He said the police\nwere in and out checking the crowd, but they didn't make any trouble.\"\n\nI nodded, feeling very badly. Four and a half hours had been his\nlimit. Well, sometimes a ninety per cent failure is really a triumph;\nafter all, it's a ten per cent success. Bish had gone four and a half\nhours without taking a drink. Maybe the percentage would be a little\nbetter the next time. I was surely old enough to stop expecting\nmiracles.\n\nThe mate of the _Pequod_ called in, around noon, and said it was safe\nfor Oscar to come back to the ship. The mate of the _Javelin_, Ram\u00f3n\nLlewellyn, called in with the same report, that along the waterfront, at\nleast, the heat was off. However, he had started an ambitious-looking\noverhaul operation, which looked as though it was good for a hundred\nhours but which could be dropped on a minute's notice, and under cover\nof this he had been taking on supplies and ammunition.\n\nWe made a long audiovisual of Murell announcing his price of eighty\ncentisols a pound for wax on behalf of Argentine Exotic Organics, Ltd.\nAs soon as that was finished, we loaded the boat-clothes we'd picked\nup for him and his travel kit and mine into a car, with Julio Kubanoff\nto bring it back to the _Times_, and went to the waterfront. When we\narrived, Ram\u00f3n Llewellyn had gotten things cleared up, and the\n_Javelin_ was ready to move as soon as we came aboard.\n\nOn the Main City Level, the waterfront is a hundred feet above the\nship pools; the ships load from and discharge onto the First Level\nDown. The city roof curves down all along the south side of the city\ninto the water and about fifty feet below it. That way, even in the\npost-sunset and post-dawn storms, ships can come in submerged around\nthe outer breakwater and under the roof, and we don't get any wind or\nheavy seas along the docks.\n\nMurell was interested in everything he saw, in the brief time while we\nwere going down along the docks to where the _Javelin_ was berthed. I\nknew he'd never actually seen it before, but he must have been\nstudying pictures of it, because from some of the remarks he made, I\ncould tell that he was familiar with it.\n\nMost of the ships had lifted out of the water and were resting on the\nwide concrete docks, but the _Javelin_ was afloat in the pool, her\ncontragravity on at specific-gravity weight reduction. She was a\ntypical hunter-ship, a hundred feet long by thirty abeam, with a squat\nconning tower amidships, and turrets for 50-mm guns and launchers for\nharpoon rockets fore and aft. The only thing open about her was the\nair-and-water lock under the conning tower. Julio, who was piloting\nthe car, set it down on the top of the aft gun turret. A couple of the\ncrewmen who were on deck grabbed our bags and hurried them inside. We\nfollowed, and as soon as Julio lifted away, the lock was sealed.\n\nImmediately, as the contragravity field dropped below the specific\ngravity of the ship, she began submerging. I got up into the conning\ntower in time to see the water of the boat pool come up over the\narmor-glass windows and the outside lights come on. For a few minutes,\nthe _Javelin_ swung slowly and moved forward, feeling her way with\nfingers of radar out of the pool and down the channel behind the\nbreakwater and under the overhang of the city roof. Then the water\nline went slowly down across the windows as she surfaced. A moment\nlater she was on full contragravity, and the ship which had been a\nsubmarine was now an aircraft.\n\nMurell, who was accustomed to the relatively drab sunsets of Terra,\nsimply couldn't take his eyes from the spectacle that covered the\nwhole western half of the sky--high clouds streaming away from the\ndaylight zone to the west and lighted from below by the sun. There\nwere more clouds coming in at a lower level from the east. By the time\nthe _Javelin_ returned to Port Sandor, it would be full dark and rain,\nwhich would soon turn to snow, would be falling. Then we'd be in for\nit again for another thousand hours.\n\nRam\u00f3n Llewellyn was saying to Joe Kivelson: \"We're one man short;\nDevis, Abdullah's helper. Hospital.\"\n\n\"Get hurt in the fight, last night? He was right with us till we got\nout to the elevators, and then I missed him.\"\n\n\"No. He made it back to the ship about the same time we did, and he\nwas all right then. Didn't even have a scratch. Strained his back at\nwork, this morning, trying to lift a power-unit cartridge by hand.\"\n\nI could believe that. Those things weighed a couple of hundred pounds.\nJoe Kivelson swore.\n\n\"What's he think this is, the First Century Pre-Atomic? Aren't there\nany lifters on the ship?\"\n\nLlewellyn shrugged. \"Probably didn't want to bother taking a couple of\nsteps to get one. The doctor told him to take treatment and\nobservation for a day or so.\"\n\n\"That's Al Devis?\" I asked. \"What hospital?\" Al Devis's strained back\nwould be good for a two-line item; he'd feel hurt if we didn't mention\nit.\n\n\"Co-op hospital.\"\n\nThat was all right. They always sent in their patient lists to the\n_Times_. Tom was griping because he'd have to do Devis's work and his\nown.\n\n\"You know anything about engines, Walt?\" he asked me.\n\n\"I know they generate a magnetic current and convert rotary magnetic\ncurrent into one-directional repulsion fields, and violate the\ndaylights out of all the old Newtonian laws of motion and attraction,\"\nI said. \"I read that in a book. That was as far as I got. The math got\na little complicated after that, and I started reading another book.\"\n\n\"You'd be a big help. Think you could hit anything with a 50-mm?\" Tom\nasked. \"I know you're pretty sharp with a pistol or a chopper, but a\ncannon's different.\"\n\n\"I could try. If you want to heave over an empty packing case or\nsomething, I could waste a few rounds seeing if I could come anywhere\nclose to it.\"\n\n\"We'll do that,\" he said. \"Ordinarily, I handle the after gun when we\nsight a monster, but somebody'll have to help Abdullah with the\nengines.\"\n\nHe spoke to his father about it. Joe Kivelson nodded.\n\n\"Walt's made some awful lucky shots with that target pistol of his, I\nknow that,\" he said, \"and I saw him make hamburger out of a slasher,\nonce, with a chopper. Have somebody blow a couple of wax skins full of\nair for targets, and when we get a little farther southeast, we'll go\ndown to the surface and have some shooting.\"\n\nI convinced Murell that the sunset would still be there in a couple of\nhours, and we took our luggage down and found the cubbyhole he and I\nwould share with Tom for sleeping quarters. A hunter-ship looks big on\nthe outside, but there's very little room for the crew. The engines\nare much bigger than would be needed on an ordinary contragravity\ncraft, because a hunter-ship operates under water as well as in the\nair. Then, there's a lot of cargo space for the wax, and the boat\nberth aft for the scout boat, so they're not exactly built for\ncomfort. They don't really need to be; a ship's rarely out more than a\nhundred and fifty hours on any cruise.\n\nMurell had done a lot of reading about every phase of the wax\nbusiness, and he wanted to learn everything he could by actual\nobservation. He said that Argentine Exotic Organics was going to keep\nhim here on Fenris as a resident buyer and his job was going to be to\ndeal with the hunters, either individually or through their\nco-operative organization, if they could get rid of Ravick and set up\nsomething he could do business with, and he wanted to be able to talk\nthe hunters' language and understand their problems.\n\nSo I took him around over the boat, showing him everything and\nconscripting any crew members I came across to explain what I\ncouldn't. I showed him the scout boat in its berth, and we climbed\ninto it and looked around. I showed him the machine that packed the\nwax into skins, and the cargo holds, and the electrolytic gills that\nextracted oxygen from sea water while we were submerged, and the\nship's armament. Finally, we got to the engine room, forward. He\nwhistled when he saw the engines.\n\n\"Why, those things are big enough for a five-thousand-ton freighter,\"\nhe said.\n\n\"They have to be,\" I said. \"Running submerged isn't the same as\nrunning in atmosphere. You ever done any swimming?\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"I was born in Antarctica, on Terra. The water's a\nlittle too cold to do much swimming there. And I've spent most of my\ntime since then in central Argentine, in the pampas country. The\nsports there are horseback riding and polo and things like that.\"\n\nWell, whattaya know! Here was a man who had not only seen a horse, but\nactually ridden one. That in itself was worth a story in the _Times_.\n\nTom and Abdullah, who were fussing around the engines, heard that.\nThey knocked off what they were doing and began asking him\nquestions--I suppose he thought they were awfully silly, but he\nanswered all of them patiently--about horses and riding. I was looking\nat a couple of spare power-unit cartridges, like the one Al Devis had\nstrained his back on, clamped to the deck out of the way.\n\nThey were only as big as a one-liter jar, rounded at one end and flat\nat the other where the power cable was connected, but they weighed\nclose to two hundred pounds apiece. Most of the weight was on the\noutside; a dazzlingly bright plating of collapsium--collapsed matter,\nthe electron shell collapsed onto the nucleus and the atoms in actual\nphysical contact--and absolutely nothing but nothing could get through\nit. Inside was about a kilogram of strontium-90; it would keep on\nemitting electrons for twenty-five years, normally, but there was a\nminiature plutonium reactor, itself shielded with collapsium, which,\namong other things, speeded that process up considerably. A cartridge\nwas good for about five years; two of them kept the engines in\noperation.\n\nThe engines themselves converted the electric current from the power\ncartridges into magnetic current, and lifted the ship and propelled\nit. Abdullah was explaining that to Murell and Murell seemed to be\ngetting it satisfactorily.\n\nFinally, we left them; Murell wanted to see the sunset some more and\nwent up to the conning tower where Joe and Ram\u00f3n were, and I decided\nto take a nap while I had a chance.\n\n\n\n\n8\n\nPRACTICE, 50-MM GUN\n\n\nIt seemed as though I had barely fallen asleep before I was wakened by\nthe ship changing direction and losing altitude. I knew there were\nclouds coming in from the east, now, on the lower air currents, and I\nsupposed that Joe was taking the _Javelin_ below them to have a look\nat the surface of the sea. So I ran up to the conning tower, and when\nI got there I found that the lower clouds were solid over us, it was\ngrowing dark, and another hunter-ship was approaching with her lights\non.\n\n\"Who is she?\" I asked.\n\n\"_Bulldog_, Nip Spazoni,\" Joe told me. \"Nip's bringing my saloon\nfighter aboard, and he wants to meet Mr. Murell.\"\n\nI remembered that the man who had roughed up the Ravick goon in\nMartian Joe's had made his getaway from town in the _Bulldog_. As I\nwatched, the other ship's boat dropped out from her stern, went\nend-over-end for an instant, and then straightened out and came\ncircling around astern of us, matching our speed and ejecting a\nmagnetic grapple.\n\nNip Spazoni and another man climbed out with life lines fast to their\nbelts and crawled along our upper deck, catching life lines that were\nthrown out to them and snapping onto them before casting loose the\nones from their boat. Somebody at the lock under the conning tower\nhauled them in.\n\nNip Spazoni's name was Old Terran Italian, but he had slanted\nMongoloid eyes and a sparse little chin-beard, which accounted for his\nnickname. The amount of intermarriage that's gone on since the First\nCentury, any resemblance between people's names and their appearances\nis purely coincidental. Oscar Fujisawa, who looks as though his name\nought to be Lief Ericsson, for example.\n\n\"Here's your prodigal, Joe,\" he was saying, peeling out of his parka\nas he came up the ladder. \"I owe him a second gunner's share on a\nmonster, fifteen tons of wax.\"\n\n\"Hey, that was a good one. You heading home, now?\" Then he turned to\nthe other man, who had followed Nip up the ladder. \"You didn't do a\nvery good job, Bill,\" he said. \"The so-and-so's out of the hospital by\nnow.\"\n\n\"Well, you know who takes care of his own,\" the crewman said. \"Give me\nsomething for effort; I tried hard enough.\"\n\n\"No, I'm not going home yet,\" Nip was answering. \"I have hold-room for\nthe wax of another one, if he isn't bigger than ordinary. I'm going to\ngo down on the bottom when the winds start and sit it out, and then\ntry to get a second one.\" Then he saw me. \"Well, hey, Walt; when did\nyou turn into a monster-hunter?\"\n\nThen he was introduced to Murell, and he and Joe and the man from\nArgentine Exotic Organics sat down at the chart table and Joe yelled\nfor a pot of coffee, and they started talking prices and quantities of\nwax. I sat in, listening. This was part of what was going to be the\nbig story of the year. Finally they got that talked out, and Joe asked\nNip how the monsters were running.\n\n\"Why, good; you oughtn't to have any trouble finding one,\" Nip said.\n\"There must have been a Nifflheim of a big storm off to the east,\nbeyond the Lava Islands. I got mine north of Cape Terror. There's huge\npatches of sea-spaghetti drifting west, all along the coast of Hermann\nReuch's Land. Here.\" He pulled out a map. \"You'll find it all along\nhere.\"\n\nMurell asked me if sea-spaghetti was something the monsters ate. His\nreading-up still had a few gaps, here and there.\n\n\"No, it's seaweed; the name describes it. Screwfish eat it; big\nschools of them follow it. Gulpers and funnelmouths and bag-bellies\neat screwfish, and monsters eat them. So wherever you find spaghetti,\nyou can count on finding a monster or two.\"\n\n\"How's the weather?\" Joe was asking.\n\n\"Good enough, now. It was almost full dark when we finished the\ncutting-up. It was raining; in fifty or sixty hours it ought to be\ngetting pretty bad.\" Spazoni pointed on the map. \"Here's about where I\nthink you ought to try, Joe.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI screened the Times, after Nip went back to his own ship. Dad said\nthat Bish Ware had called in, with nothing to report but a vague\nsuspicion that something nasty was cooking. Steve Ravick and Leo\nBelsher were taking things, even the announcement of the Argentine\nExotic Organics price, too calmly.\n\n\"I think so, myself,\" he added. \"That gang has some kind of a knife up\ntheir sleeve. Bish is trying to find out just what it is.\"\n\n\"Is he drinking much?\" I asked.\n\n\"Well, he isn't on the wagon, I can tell you that,\" Dad said. \"I'm\nbeginning to think that he isn't really sober till he's half\nplastered.\"\n\nThere might be something to that, I thought. There are all kinds of\nweird individualities about human metabolism; for all I knew, alcohol\nmight actually be a food for Bish. Or he might have built up some kind\nof immunity, with antibodies that were themselves harmful if he didn't\nhave alcohol to neutralize them.\n\nThe fugitive from what I couldn't bring myself to call justice proved\nto know just a little, but not much, more about engines than I did.\nThat meant that Tom would still have to take Al Devis's place, and I'd\nhave to take his with the after 50-mm. So the ship went down to almost\nsea surface, and Tom and I went to the stern turret.\n\nThe gun I was to handle was an old-model Terran Federation Army\ninfantry-platoon accompanying gun. The mount, however, was\npower-driven, like the mount for a 90-mm contragravity tank gun.\nReconciling the firing mechanism of the former with the elevating and\ntraversing gear of the latter had produced one of the craziest pieces\nof machinery that ever gave an ordnance engineer nightmares. It was a\nlocal job, of course. An ordnance engineer in Port Sandor doesn't\nreally have to be a raving maniac, but it's a help.\n\nExternally, the firing mechanism consisted of a pistol grip and\ntrigger, which looked all right to me. The sight was a standard\nbinocular light-gun sight, with a spongeplastic mask to save the\ngunner from a pair of black eyes every time he fired it. The elevating\nand traversing gear was combined in one lever on a ball-and-socket\njoint. You could move the gun diagonally in any direction in one\nmotion, but you had to push or pull the opposite way. Something would\ngo plonk when the trigger was pulled on an empty chamber, so I did\nsome dry practice at the crests of waves.\n\n\"Now, mind,\" Tom was telling me, \"this is a lot different from a\npistol.\"\n\n\"So I notice,\" I replied. I had also noticed that every time I got the\ncross hairs on anything and squeezed the trigger, they were on\nsomething else when the trigger went plonk. \"All this gun needs is\nanother lever, to control the motion of the ship.\"\n\n\"Oh, that only makes it more fun,\" Tom told me.\n\nThen he loaded in a clip of five rounds, big expensive-looking\ncartridges a foot long, with bottle-neck cases and pointed shells.\n\nThe targets were regular tallow-wax skins, blown up and weighted at\none end so that they would float upright. He yelled into the intercom,\nand one was chucked overboard ahead. A moment later, I saw it bobbing\naway astern of us. I put my face into the sight-mask, caught it,\ncentered the cross hairs, and squeezed. The gun gave a thunderclap\nand recoiled past me, and when I pulled my face out of the mask, I saw\na column of water and spray about fifty feet left and a hundred yards\nover.\n\n\"You won't put any wax in the hold with that kind of shooting,\" Tom\ntold me.\n\nI fired again. This time, there was no effect at all that I could see.\nThe shell must have gone away over and hit the water a couple of miles\nastern. Before Tom could make any comment on that shot, I let off\nanother, and this time I hit the water directly in front of the\nbobbing wax skin. Good line shot, but away short.\n\n\"Well, you scared him, anyhow,\" Tom said, in mock commendation.\n\nI remembered some of the comments I'd made when I'd been trying to\nteach him to hit something smaller than the target frame with a\npistol, and humbled myself. The next two shots were reasonably close,\nbut neither would have done any damage if the rapidly vanishing skin\nhad really been a monster. Tom clucked sadly and slapped in another\nclip.\n\n\"Heave over another one,\" he called. \"That monster got away.\"\n\nThe trouble was, there were a lot of tricky air currents along the\nsurface of the water. The engines were running on lift to match\nexactly the weight of the ship, which meant that she had no weight at\nall, and a lot of wind resistance. The drive was supposed to match the\nwind speed, and the ship was supposed to be kept nosed into the wind.\nA lot of that is automatic, but it can't be made fully so, which means\nthat the pilot has to do considerable manual correcting, and no human\nalive can do that perfectly. Joe Kivelson or Ram\u00f3n Llewellyn or\nwhoever was at the controls was doing a masterly job, but that fell\naway short of giving me a stable gun platform.\n\nI caught the second target as soon as it bobbed into sight and slammed\na shell at it. The explosion was half a mile away, but the shell\nhadn't missed the target by more than a few yards. Heartened, I fired\nagain, and that shot was simply dreadful.\n\n\"I know what you're doing wrong,\" Tom said. \"You're squeezing the\ntrigger.\"\n\n\"_Huh_?\"\n\nI pulled my face out of the sight-mask and looked at him to see if he\nwere exhibiting any other signs of idiocy. That was like criticizing\nsomebody for using a fork instead of eating with his fingers.\n\n\"You're not shooting a pistol,\" he continued. \"You don't have to hold\nthe gun on the target with the hand you shoot with. The mount control,\nin your other hand, does that. As soon as the cross hairs touch the\ntarget, just grab the trigger as though it was a million sols getting\naway from you. Well, sixteen thousand; that's what a monster's worth\nnow, Murell prices. Jerking won't have the least effect on your hold\nwhatever.\"\n\nSo that was why I'd had so much trouble making a pistol shot out of\nTom, and why it would take a special act of God to make one out of his\nfather. And that was why monster-hunters caused so few casualties in\nbarroom shootings around Port Sandor, outside of bystanders and\nback-bar mirrors. I felt like Newton after he'd figured out why the\napple bopped him on the head.\n\n\"You mean like this?\" I asked innocently, as soon as I had the hairs\non the target again, violating everything I held most sacredly true\nabout shooting.\n\nThe shell must have passed within inches of the target; it bobbed over\nflat and the weight pulled it up again into the backwave from the\nshell and it bobbed like crazy.\n\n\"That would have been a dead monster,\" Tom said. \"Let's see you do it\nagain.\"\n\nI didn't; the next shot was terrible. Overconfidence. I had one more\nshot, and I didn't want to use up another clip of the _Javelin_'s\nammo. They cost like crazy, even if they were Army rejects. The sea\ncurrent was taking the target farther away every second, but I took my\ntime on the next one, bringing the horizontal hair level with the\nbottom of the inflated target and traversing quickly, grabbing the\ntrigger as soon as the vertical hair touched it. There was a\nwater-spout, and the target shot straight up for fifty feet; the shell\nmust have exploded directly under it. There was a sound of cheering\nfrom the intercom. Tom asked if I wanted to fire another clip. I told\nhim I thought I had the hang of it now, and screwed a swab onto the\nramrod and opened the breech to clean the gun.\n\nJoe Kivelson grinned at me when I went up to the conning tower.\n\n\"That wasn't bad, Walt,\" he said. \"You never manned a 50-mm before,\ndid you?\"\n\n\"No, and it's all backward from anything I ever learned about\nshooting,\" I said. \"Now, suppose I get a shot at a monster; where do I\ntry to hit him?\"\n\n\"Here, I'll show you.\" He got a block of lucite, a foot square on the\nend by two and a half feet long, out of a closet under the chart\ntable. In it was a little figure of a Jarvis's sea-monster; long body\ntapering to a three-fluked tail, wide horizontal flippers like the\nwings of an old pre-contragravity aircraft, and a long neck with a\nlittle head and a wide tusked mouth.\n\n\"Always get him from in front,\" he said. \"Aim right here, where his\nchest makes a kind of V at the base of the neck. A 50-mm will go six\nor eight feet into him before it explodes, and it'll explode among his\nheart and lungs and things. If it goes straight along his body, it'll\nopen him up and make the cutting-up easier, and it won't spoil much\nwax. That's where I always shoot.\"\n\n\"Suppose I get a broadside shot?\"\n\n\"Why, then put your shell right under the flukes at the end of the\ntail. That'll turn him and position him for a second shot from in\nfront. But mostly, you'll get a shot from in front, if the ship's down\nnear the surface. Monsters will usually try to attack the ship. They\nattack anything around their own size that they see,\" he told me. \"But\ndon't ever make a body shot broadside-to. You'll kill the monster, but\nyou'll blow about five thousand sols' worth of wax to Nifflheim doing\nit.\"\n\nIt had been getting dusky while I had been shooting; it was almost\nfull dark now, and the _Javelin's_ lights were on. We were making\nclose to Mach 3, headed east now, and running away from the remaining\ndaylight.\n\nWe began running into squalls of rain, and then rain mixed with wet\nsnow. The underside lights came on, and the lookout below began\nreporting patches of sea-spaghetti. Finally, the boat was dropped out\nand went circling away ahead, swinging its light back and forth over\nthe water, and radioing back reports. Spaghetti. Spaghetti with a big\nschool of screwfish working on it. Funnel-mouths working on the\nscrewfish. Finally the speaker gave a shrill whistle.\n\n\"_Monster ho!_\" the voice yelled. \"About ten points off your port bow.\nWe're circling over it now.\"\n\n\"Monster ho!\" Kivelson yelled into the intercom, in case anybody\nhadn't heard. \"All hands to killing stations.\" Then he saw me standing\nthere, wondering what was going to happen next. \"Well, mister, didn't\nyou hear me?\" he bellowed. \"Get to your gun!\"\n\nGee! I thought. I'm one of the crew, now.\n\n\"Yes sir!\" I grabbed the handrail of the ladder and slid down, then\nraced aft to the gun turret.\n\n\n\n\n9\n\nMONSTER KILLING\n\n\nThere was a man in the turret, waiting to help me. He had a clip of\nfive rounds in the gun, the searchlight on, and the viewscreen tuned\nto the forward pickup. After checking the gun and loading the chamber,\nI looked in that, and in the distance, lighted by the boat above and\nthe searchlight of the _Javelin_, I saw a long neck with a little head\non the end of it weaving about. We were making straight for it, losing\naltitude and speed as we went.\n\nThen the neck dipped under the water and a little later reappeared,\ncoming straight for the advancing light. The forward gun went off,\nshaking the ship with its recoil, and the head ducked under again.\nThere was a spout from the shell behind it.\n\nI took my eyes from the forward screen and looked out the rear window,\nready to shove my face into the sight-mask. An instant later, the head\nand neck reappeared astern of us. I fired, without too much hope of\nhitting anything, and then the ship was rising and circling.\n\nAs soon as I'd fired, the monster had sounded, headfirst. I fired a\nsecond shot at his tail, in hope of crippling his steering gear, but\nthat was a clean miss, too, and then the ship was up to about five\nthousand feet. My helper pulled out the partly empty clip and replaced\nit with a full one, giving me five and one in the chamber.\n\nIf I'd been that monster, I thought, I'd have kept on going till I was\na couple of hundred miles away from this place; but evidently that\nwasn't the way monsters thought, if thinking is what goes on inside a\nbrain cavity the size of a quart bottle in a head the size of two oil\ndrums on a body as big as the ship that was hunting him. He'd found a\nlot of gulpers and funnelmouths, and he wasn't going to be chased away\nfrom his dinner by somebody shooting at him.\n\nI wondered why they didn't eat screwfish, instead of the things that\npreyed on them. Maybe they did and we didn't know it. Or maybe they\njust didn't like screwfish. There were a lot of things we didn't know\nabout sea-monsters.\n\nFor that matter, I wondered why we didn't grow tallow-wax by\ncarniculture. We could grow any other animal matter we wanted. I'd\noften thought of that.\n\nThe monster wasn't showing any inclination to come to the surface\nagain, and finally Joe Kivelson's voice came out of the intercom:\n\n\"Run in the guns and seal ports. Secure for submersion. We're going\ndown and chase him up.\"\n\nMy helper threw the switch that retracted the gun and sealed the gun\nport. I checked that and reported, \"After gun secure.\" Hans Cronje's\nvoice, a moment later, said, \"Forward gun secure,\" and then Ram\u00f3n\nLlewellyn said, \"Ship secure; ready to submerge.\"\n\nThen the _Javelin_ began to settle, and the water came up over the\nwindow. I didn't know what the radar was picking up. All I could see\nwas the screen and the window; water lighted for about fifty feet in\nfront and behind. I saw a cloud of screwfish pass over and around us,\nspinning rapidly as they swam as though on lengthwise axis--they\nalways spin counterclockwise, never clockwise. A couple of\nfunnelmouths were swimming after them, overtaking and engulfing them.\n\nThen the captain yelled, \"Get set for torpedo,\" and my helper and I\neach grabbed a stanchion. A couple of seconds later it seemed as\nthough King Neptune himself had given the ship a poke in the nose; my\nhands were almost jerked loose from their hold. Then she swung slowly,\nnosing up and down, and finally Joe Kivelson spoke again:\n\n\"We're going to surface. Get set to run the guns out and start\nshooting as soon as we're out of the water.\"\n\n\"What happened?\" I asked my helper.\n\n\"Must have put the torp right under him and lifted him,\" he said. \"He\ncould be dead or stunned. Or he could be live and active and spoiling\nfor a fight.\"\n\nThat last could be trouble. The _Times_ had run quite a few stories,\nsome with black borders, about ships that had gotten into trouble with\nmonsters. A hunter-ship is heavy and it is well-armored--install\nhyperdrive engines in one, and you could take her from here to\nTerra--but a monster is a tough brute, and he has armor of his own,\nscales an inch or so thick and tougher than sole leather. A lot of\nchair seats around Port Sandor are made of single monster scales. A\nmonster strikes with its head, like a snake. They can smash a ship's\nboat, and they've been known to punch armor-glass windows out of their\nframes. I didn't want the window in front of me coming in at me with a\nmonster head the size of a couple of oil drums and full of big tusks\nfollowing it.\n\nThe _Javelin_ came up fast, but not as fast as the monster, which\nseemed to have been injured only in his disposition. He was on the\nsurface already, about fifty yards astern of us, threshing with his\nforty-foot wing-fins, his neck arched back to strike. I started to\nswing my gun for the chest shot Joe Kivelson had recommended as soon\nas it was run out, and then the ship was swung around and tilted up\nforward by a sudden gust of wind. While I was struggling to get the\nsights back on the monster, the ship gave another lurch and the cross\nhairs were right on its neck, about six feet below the head. I grabbed\nthe trigger, and as soon as the shot was off, took my eyes from the\nsights. I was just a second too late to see the burst, but not too\nlate to see the monster's neck jerk one way out of the smoke puff and\nits head fly another. A second later, the window in front of me was\nsplashed with blood as the headless neck came down on our fantail.\n\nImmediately, two rockets jumped from the launcher over the gun turret,\nplanting a couple of harpoons, and the boat, which had been circling\naround since we had submerged, dived into the water and passed under\nthe monster, coming up on the other side dragging another harpoon\nline. The monster was still threshing its wings and flogging with its\nheadless neck. It takes a monster quite a few minutes to tumble to the\nfact that it's been killed. My helper was pounding my back black and\nblue with one hand and trying to pump mine off with the other, and I\nwas getting an ovation from all over the ship. At the same time, a\ncouple more harpoons went into the thing from the ship, and the boat\nput another one in from behind.\n\nI gathered that shooting monsters' heads off wasn't at all usual, and\nhastened to pass it off as pure luck, so that everybody would hurry up\nand deny it before they got the same idea themselves.\n\nWe hadn't much time for ovations, though. We had a very slowly dying\nmonster, and before he finally discovered that he was dead, a couple\nof harpoons got pulled out and had to be replaced. Finally, however,\nhe quieted down, and the boat swung him around, bringing the tail past\nour bow, and the ship cut contragravity to specific-gravity level and\nsettled to float on top of the water. The boat dived again, and payed\nout a line that it brought up and around and up again, lashing the\nmonster fast alongside.\n\n\"All right,\" Kivelson was saying, out of the intercom. \"Shooting's\nover. All hands for cutting-up.\"\n\nI pulled on a parka and zipped it up and went out onto the deck.\nEverybody who wasn't needed at engines or controls was there, and\nequipment was coming up from below--power saws and sonocutters and\neven a solenoid jackhammer. There were half a dozen floodlights, on\nsmall contragravity lifters; they were run up on lines fifty feet\nabove the ship's deck. By this time it was completely dark and fine\nsnow was blowing. I could see that Joe Kivelson was anxious to get the\ncutting-up finished before the wind got any worse.\n\n\"Walt, can you use a machine gun?\" he asked me.\n\nI told him I could. I was sure of it; a machine gun is fired in a\nrational and decent manner.\n\n\"Well, all right. Suppose you cover for us from the boat,\" he said.\n\"Mr. Murell can pilot for you. You never worked at cutting-up before,\nand neither did he. You'd be more of a hindrance than a help and so\nwould he. But we do need a good machine gunner. As soon as we start\nthrowing out waste, we'll have all the slashers and halberd fish for\nmiles around. You just shoot them as fast as you see them.\"\n\nHe was courteous enough not to add: \"And don't shoot any of the crew.\"\n\nThe boat came in and passed out the lines of its harpoons, and Murell\nand I took the places of Ces\u00e1rio Vieira and the other man. We went up\nto the nose, and Murell took his place at the controls, and I got back\nof the 7-mm machine gun and made sure that there were plenty of extra\nbelts of ammo. Then, as we rose, I pulled the goggles down from my\nhood, swung the gun away from the ship, and hammered off a one-second\nburst to make sure it was working, after which I settled down, glad I\nhad a comfortable seat and wasn't climbing around on that monster.\n\nThey began knocking scales loose with the jackhammer and cutting into\nthe leathery skin underneath with sonocutters. The sea was getting\nheavy, and the ship and the attached monster had begun to roll.\n\n\"That's pretty dangerous work,\" Murell said. \"If a man using one of\nthose cutters slipped....\"\n\n\"It's happened,\" I told him. \"You met our peg-legged compositor,\nJulio. That was how he lost his leg.\"\n\n\"I don't blame them for wanting all they can get for tallow-wax.\"\n\nThey had the monster opened down the belly, and were beginning to cut\nloose big chunks of the yellow tallow-wax and throw them into cargo\nnets and swing them aboard with lifters, to be chucked down the cargo\nhatches. I was only able to watch that for a minute or so and tell\nMurell what was going on, and then the first halberd fish, with a\nspearlike nose and sharp ridges of the nearest thing to bone you find\non Fenris, came swimming up. I swung the gun on the leader and gave\nhim a second of fire, and then a two-second burst on the ones behind.\nThen I waited for a few seconds until the survivors converged on their\ndead and injured companions and gave them another burst, which wiped\nout the lot of them.\n\nIt was only a couple of seconds after that that the first slasher came\nin, shiny as heat-blued steel and waving four clawed tentacles that\ngrew around its neck. It took me a second or so to get the sights on\nhim. He stopped slashing immediately. Slashers are smart; you kill\nthem and they find it out right away.\n\nBefore long, the water around the ship and the monster was polluted\nwith things like that. I had to keep them away from the men, now\nworking up to their knees in water, and at the same time avoid\nmassacring the crew I was trying to protect, and Murell had to keep\nthe boat in position, in spite of a steadily rising wind, and every\ntime I had to change belts, there'd be a new rush of things that had\nto be shot in a hurry. The ammunition bill for covering a cutting-up\noperation is one of the things that runs up expenses for a\nhunter-ship. The ocean bottom around here must be carpeted with\nmachine-gun brass.\n\nFinally, they got the job done, and everybody went below and sealed\nship. We sealed the boat and went down after her. The last I saw, the\nremains of the monster, now stripped of wax, had been cast off, and\nthe water around it was rioting with slashers and clawbeaks and\nhalberd fish and similar marine unpleasantnesses.\n\n\n\n\n10\n\nMAYDAY, MAYDAY\n\n\nGetting a ship's boat berthed inside the ship in the air is tricky\nwork under the best of conditions; the way the wind was blowing by\nnow, it would have been like trying to thread a needle inside a\nconcrete mixer. We submerged after the ship and went in underwater.\nThen we had to wait in the boat until the ship rose above the surface\nand emptied the water out of the boat berth. When that was done and\nthe boat berth was sealed again, the ship went down seventy fathoms\nand came to rest on the bottom, and we unsealed the boat and got out.\n\nThere was still the job of packing the wax into skins, but that could\nwait. Everybody was tired and dirty and hungry. We took turns washing\nup, three at a time, in the little ship's latrine which, for some\nreason going back to sailing-ship days on Terra, was called the\n\"head.\" Finally the whole sixteen of us gathered in the relatively\ncomfortable wardroom under the after gun turret.\n\nComfortable, that is, to the extent that everybody could find a place\nto sit down, or could move about without tripping over somebody else.\nThere was a big pot of coffee, and everybody had a plate or bowl of\nhot food. There's always plenty of hot food to hand on a hunter-ship;\nno regular meal-times, and everybody eats, as he sleeps, when he has\ntime. This is the only time when a whole hunter crew gets together,\nafter a monster has been killed and cut up and the ship is resting on\nthe bottom and nobody has to stand watch.\n\nEverybody was talking about the killing, of course, and the wax we had\nin the hold, and counting the money they were going to get for it, at\nthe new eighty-centisol price.\n\n\"Well, I make it about fourteen tons,\" Ram\u00f3n Llewellyn, who had been\nchecking the wax as it went into the hold, said. He figured mentally\nfor a moment, and added, \"Call it twenty-two thousand sols.\" Then he\nhad to fall back on a pencil and paper to figure shares.\n\nI was surprised to find that he was reckoning shares for both Murell\nand myself.\n\n\"Hey, do we want to let them do that?\" I whispered to Murell. \"We just\ncame along for the ride.\"\n\n\"I don't want the money,\" he said. \"These people need every cent they\ncan get.\"\n\nSo did I, for that matter, and I didn't have salary and expense\naccount from a big company on Terra. However, I hadn't come along in\nthe expectation of making anything out of it, and a newsman has to be\ncareful about the outside money he picks up. It wouldn't do any harm\nin the present instance, but as a practice it can lead to all kinds of\nthings, like playing favorites, coloring news, killing stories that\nshouldn't be killed. We do enough of that as it is, like playing down\nthe tread-snail business for Bish Ware and the spaceport people, and\nnever killing anybody except in a \"local bar.\" It's hard to draw a\nline on that sort of thing.\n\n\"We're just guests,\" I said. \"We don't work here.\"\n\n\"The dickens you are,\" Joe Kivelson contradicted. \"Maybe you came\naboard as guests, but you're both part of the crew now. I never saw a\nprettier shot on a monster than Walt made--took that thing's head off\nlike a chicken on a chopping block--and he did a swell job of covering\nfor the cutting-up. And he couldn't have done that if Murell hadn't\nhandled the boat the way he did, and that was no easy job.\"\n\n\"Well, let's talk about that when we get to port,\" I said. \"Are we\ngoing right back, or are we going to try for another monster?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Joe said. \"We could stow the wax, if we didn't get too\nmuch, but if we stay out, we'll have to wait out the wind and by then\nit'll be pretty cold.\"\n\n\"The longer we stay out, the more the cruise'll cost,\" Abdullah\nMonnahan, the engineer, said, \"and the expenses'll cut into the\nshares.\"\n\n\"Tell the truth, I'm sort of antsy to get back,\" Joe Kivelson said. \"I\nwant to see what's going on in Port Sandor.\"\n\n\"So am I,\" Murell said. \"I want to get some kind of office opened, and\nget into business. What time will the _Cape Canaveral_ be getting in?\nI want a big cargo, for the first time.\"\n\n\"Oh, not for four hundred hours, at the least,\" I said. \"The\nspaceships always try to miss the early-dark and early-daylight\nstorms. It's hard to get a big ship down in a high wind.\"\n\n\"That'll be plenty of time, I suppose,\" Murell said. \"There's all that\nwax you have stored, and what I can get out of the Co-operative stores\nfrom crews that reclaim it. But I'm going to have a lot to do.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I agreed. \"Dodging bullets, for one.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't expect any trouble,\" Murell said. \"This fellow Ravick's\nshot his round.\"\n\nHe was going to say something else, but before he could say it there\nwas a terrific roar forward. The whole ship bucked like a recoiling\ngun, throwing everybody into a heap, and heeled over to starboard.\nThere were a lot of yells, particularly from those who had been\nsplashed with hot coffee, and somebody was shouting something about\nthe magazines.\n\n\"The magazines are aft, you dunderhead,\" Joe Kivelson told him,\nshoving himself to his feet. \"Stay put, everybody; I'll see what it\nis.\"\n\nHe pulled open the door forward. An instant later, he had slammed it\nshut and was dogging it fast.\n\n\"Hull must be ruptured forward; we're making water. It's spouting up\nthe hatch from the engine room like a geyser,\" he said. \"Ram\u00f3n, go see\nwhat it's like in the boat berth. The rest of you, follow him, and\ngrab all the food and warm clothing you can. We're going to have to\nabandon.\"\n\nHe stood by the doorway aft, shoving people through and keeping them\nfrom jamming up, saying: \"Take it easy, now; don't crowd. We'll all\nget out.\" There wasn't any panic. A couple of men were in the doorway\nof the little galley when I came past, handing out cases of food. As\nnothing was coming out at the instant, I kept on, and on the way back\nto the boat-berth hatch, I pulled down as many parkas and pairs of\noverpants as I could carry, squeezing past Tom, who was collecting\nfleece-lined hip boots. Each pair was buckled together at the tops; a\nhunter always does that, even at home ashore.\n\nRam\u00f3n had the hatch open, and had opened the top hatch of the boat,\nbelow. I threw my double armload of clothing down through it and slid\ndown after, getting out of the way of the load of boots Tom dumped\nahead of him. Joe Kivelson came down last, carrying the ship's log and\nsome other stuff. A little water was trickling over the edge of the\nhatch above.\n\n\"It's squirting up from below in a dozen places,\" he said, after he'd\nsealed the boat. \"The whole front of the ship must be blown out.\"\n\n\"Well, now we know what happened to Simon MacGregor's _Claymore_,\" I\nsaid, more to myself than to anybody else.\n\nJoe and Hans Cronje, the gunner, were getting a rocket out of the\nlocker, detaching the harpoon and fitting on an explosive warhead. He\nstopped, while he and Cronje were loading it into the after launcher,\nand nodded at me.\n\n\"That's what I think, too,\" he said. \"Everybody grab onto something;\nwe're getting the door open.\"\n\nI knew what was coming and started hugging a stanchion as though it\nwere a long-lost sweetheart, and Murell, who didn't but knew enough to\nimitate those who did, hugged it from the other side. The rocket\nwhooshed out of the launcher and went off with a deafening bang\noutside. For an instant, nothing happened, and I told Murell not to\nlet go. Then the lock burst in and the water, at seventy fathoms'\npressure, hit the boat. Abdullah had gotten the engines on and was\nbacking against it. After a little, the pressure equalized and we went\nout the broken lock stern first.\n\nWe circled and passed over the _Javelin_, and then came back. She was\nlying in the ooze, a quarter over on her side, and her whole bow was\nblown out to port. Joe Kivelson got the square box he had brought down\nfrom the ship along with the log, fussed a little with it, and then\nlaunched it out the disposal port. It was a radio locator. Sometimes a\nlucky ship will get more wax than the holds' capacity; they pack it in\nskins and anchor it on the bottom, and drop one of those gadgets with\nit. It would keep on sending a directional signal and the name of the\nship for a couple of years.\n\n\"Do you really think it was sabotage?\" Murell was asking me. Blowing\nup a ship with sixteen men aboard must have seemed sort of extreme to\nhim. Maybe that wasn't according to Terran business ethics. \"Mightn't\nit have been a power unit?\"\n\n\"No. Power units don't blow, and if one did, it would vaporize the\nwhole ship and a quarter of a cubic mile of water around her. No, that\nwas old fashioned country-style chemical explosive. Cataclysmite,\nprobably.\"\n\n\"Ravick?\" he asked, rather unnecessarily.\n\n\"You know how well he can get along without you and Joe Kivelson, and\nhere's a chance to get along without both of you together.\" Everybody\nin the boat was listening, so I continued: \"How much do you know about\nthis fellow Devis, who strained his back at the last moment?\"\n\n\"Engine room's where he could have planted something,\" Joe Kivelson\nsaid.\n\n\"He was in there by himself for a while, the morning after the\nmeeting,\" Abdullah Monnahan added.\n\n\"And he disappeared between the meeting room and the elevator, during\nthe fight,\" Tom mentioned. \"And when he showed up, he hadn't been\nmarked up any. I'd have thought he'd have been pretty badly\nbeaten--unless they knew he was one of their own gang.\"\n\n\"We're going to look Devis up when we get back,\" somebody said\npleasantly.\n\n\"If we get back,\" Ram\u00f3n Llewellyn told him. \"That's going to take some\ndoing.\"\n\n\"We have the boat,\" Hans Cronje said. \"It's a little crowded, but we\ncan make it back to Port Sandor.\"\n\n\"I hope we can,\" Abe Clifford, the navigator, said. \"Shall we take her\nup, Joe?\"\n\n\"Yes, see what it's like on top,\" the skipper replied.\n\nGoing up, we passed a monster at about thirty fathoms. It stuck its\nneck out and started for us. Monnahan tilted the boat almost vertical\nand put on everything the engines had, lift and drive parallel. An\ninstant later, we broke the surface and shot into the air.\n\nThe wind hit the boat as though it had been a ping-pong ball, and it\nwas several seconds, and bad seconds at that, before Monnahan regained\neven a semblance of control. There was considerable bad language, and\nseveral of the crew had bloody noses. Monnahan tried to get the boat\nturned into the wind. A circuit breaker popped, and red lights blazed\nall over the instrument panel. He eased off and let the wind take\nover, and for a while we were flying in front of it like a rifle\nbullet. Gradually, he nosed down and submerged.\n\n\"Well, that's that.\" Joe Kivelson said, when we were back in the\nunderwater calm again. \"We'll have to stay under till the wind's over.\nDon't anybody move around or breathe any deeper than you have to.\nWe'll have to conserve oxygen.\"\n\n\"Isn't the boat equipped with electrolytic gills?\" Murell asked.\n\n\"Sure, to supply oxygen for a maximum of six men. We have sixteen in\nhere.\"\n\n\"How long will our air last, for sixteen of us?\" I asked.\n\n\"About eight hours.\"\n\nIt would take us fifty to get to Port Sandor, running submerged. The\nwind wouldn't even begin to fall in less than twenty.\n\n\"We can go south, to the coast of Hermann Reuch's Land,\" Abe Clifford,\nthe navigator, said. \"Let me figure something out.\"\n\nHe dug out a slide rule and a pencil and pad and sat down with his\nback to the back of the pilot's seat, under the light. Everybody\nwatched him in a silence which Joe Kivelson broke suddenly by\nbellowing:\n\n\"Dumont! You light that pipe and I'll feed it to you!\"\n\nOld Piet Dumont grabbed the pipe out of his mouth with one hand and\npocketed his lighter with the other.\n\n\"Gosh, Joe; I guess I just wasn't thinking...\" he began.\n\n\"Well, give me that pipe.\" Joe put it in the drawer under the charts.\n\"Now you won't have it handy the next time you don't think.\"\n\nAfter a while, Abe Clifford looked up. \"Ship's position I don't have\nexactly; somewhere around East 25 Longitude, South 20 Latitude. I\ncan't work out our present position at all, except that we're\nsomewhere around South 30 Latitude. The locator signal is almost\nexactly north-by-northeast of us. If we keep it dead astern, we'll\ncome out in Sancerre Bay, on Hermann Reuch's Land. If we make that,\nwe're all right. We'll be in the lee of the Hacksaw Mountains, and we\ncan surface from time to time to change air, and as soon as the wind\nfalls we can start for home.\"\n\nThen he and Abdullah and Joe went into a huddle, arguing about\ncruising speed submerged. The results weren't so heartening.\n\n\"It looks like a ten-hour trip, submerged,\" Joe said. \"That's two\nhours too long, and there's no way of getting more oxygen out of the\ngills than we're getting now. We'll just have to use less. Everybody\nlie down and breathe as shallowly as possible, and don't do anything\nto use energy. I'm going to get on the radio and see what I can\nraise.\"\n\nBig chance, I thought. These boat radios were only used for\ncommunicating with the ship while scouting; they had a strain-everything\nrange of about three hundred miles. Hunter-ships don't crowd that close\ntogether when they're working. Still, there was a chance that somebody\nelse might be sitting it out on the bottom within hearing. So Abe took\nthe controls and kept the signal from the wreck of the _Javelin_ dead\nastern, and Joe Kivelson began speaking into the radio:\n\n\"Mayday, Mayday, Mayday, Mayday. Captain Kivelson, _Javelin_, calling.\nMy ship was wrecked by an explosion; all hands now in scout boat,\nproceeding toward Sancerre Bay, on course south-by-southwest from the\nwreck. Locator signal is being broadcast from the _Javelin_. Other\nthan that, we do not know our position. Calling all craft, calling\nMayday.\"\n\nHe stopped talking. The radio was silent except for an occasional\nfrying-fat crackle of static. Then he began over again.\n\nI curled up, trying to keep my feet out of anybody's face and my face\nclear of anybody else's feet. Somebody began praying, and somebody\nelse told him to belay it, he was wasting oxygen. I tried to go to\nsleep, which was the only practical thing to do. I must have\nsucceeded. When I woke again, Joe Kivelson was saying, exasperatedly:\n\n\"Mayday, Mayday, Mayday, Mayday...\"\n\n\n\n\n11\n\nDARKNESS AND COLD\n\n\nThe next time I woke, Tom Kivelson was reciting the Mayday, Mayday\nincantation into the radio, and his father was asleep. The man who had\nbeen praying had started again, and nobody seemed to care whether he\nwasted oxygen or not. It was a Theosophist prayer to the Spirit\nGuides, and I remembered that Ces\u00e1rio Vieira was a Theosophist. Well,\nmaybe there really were Spirit Guides. If there were, we'd all be\nfinding out before long. I found that I didn't care one hoot which\nway, and I set that down to oxygen deficiency.\n\nThen Glenn Murell broke in on the monotone call for help and the\nprayer.\n\n\"We're done for if we stay down here another hour,\" he said. \"Any\nargument on that?\"\n\nThere wasn't any. Joe Kivelson opened his eyes and looked around.\n\n\"We haven't raised anything at all on the radio,\" Murell went on.\n\"That means nobody's within an hour of reaching us. Am I right?\"\n\n\"I guess that's about the size of it,\" Joe Kivelson conceded.\n\n\"How close to land are we?\"\n\n\"The radar isn't getting anything but open water and schools of\nfish,\" Abe Clifford said. \"For all I know, we could be inside Sancerre\nBay now.\"\n\n\"Well, then, why don't we surface?\" Murell continued. \"It's a thousand\nto one against us, but if we stay here our chances are precisely one\nhundred per cent negative.\"\n\n\"What do you think?\" Joe asked generally. \"I think Mr. Murell's stated\nit correctly.\"\n\n\"There is no death,\" Ces\u00e1rio said. \"Death is only a change, and then\nmore of life. I don't care what you do.\"\n\n\"What have we got to lose?\" somebody else asked. \"We're broke and\ngambling on credit now.\"\n\n\"All right; we surface,\" the skipper said. \"Everybody grab onto\nsomething. We'll take the Nifflheim of a slamming around as soon as\nwe're out of the water.\"\n\nWe woke up everybody who was sleeping, except the three men who had\ncompletely lost consciousness. Those we wrapped up in blankets and\ntarpaulins, like mummies, and lashed them down. We gathered everything\nthat was loose and made it fast, and checked the fastenings of\neverything else. Then Abdullah Monnahan pointed the nose of the boat\nstraight up and gave her everything the engines could put out. Just as\nwe were starting upward, I heard Ces\u00e1rio saying:\n\n\"If anybody wants to see me in the next reincarnation, I can tell you\none thing; I won't reincarnate again on Fenris!\"\n\nThe headlights only penetrated fifty or sixty feet ahead of us. I\ncould see slashers and clawbeaks and funnelmouths and gulpers and\nthings like that getting out of our way in a hurry. Then we were out\nof the water and shooting straight up in the air.\n\nIt was the other time all over again, doubled in spades, only this\ntime Abdullah didn't try to fight it; he just kept the boat rising.\nThen it went end-over-end, again and again. I think most of us blacked\nout; I'm sure I did, for a while. Finally, more by good luck than good\nmanagement, he got us turned around with the wind behind us. That\nlasted for a while, and then we started keyholing again. I could see\nthe instrument panel from where I'd lashed myself fast; it was going\ncompletely bughouse. Once, out the window in front, I could see jagged\nmountains ahead. I just shut my eyes and waited for the Spirit Guides\nto come and pick up the pieces.\n\nWhen they weren't along, after a few seconds that seemed like half an\nhour, I opened my eyes again. There were more mountains ahead, and\nmountains to the right. This'll do it, I thought, and I wondered how\nlong it would take Dad to find out what had happened to us. Ces\u00e1rio\nhad started praying again, and so had Abdullah Monnahan, who had just\nremembered that he had been brought up a Moslem. I hoped he wasn't\ntrying to pray in the direction of Mecca, even allowing that he knew\nwhich way Mecca was from Fenris generally. That made me laugh, and\nthen I thought, This is a fine time to be laughing at anything. Then I\nrealized that things were so bad that anything more that happened was\nfunny.\n\nI was still laughing when I discovered that the boat had slowed to a\ncrawl and we were backing in between two high cliffs. Evidently\nAbdullah, who had now stopped praying, had gotten enough control of\nthe boat to keep her into the wind and was keeping enough speed\nforward to yield to it gradually. That would be all right, I thought,\nif the force of the wind stayed constant, and as soon as I thought of\nthat, it happened. We got into a relative calm, the boat went forward\nagain, and then was tossed up and spun around. Then I saw a mountain\nslope directly behind us, out the rear window.\n\nA moment later, I saw rocks and boulders sticking out of it in\napparent defiance of gravitation, and then I realized that it was\nlevel ground and we were coming down at it backward. That lasted a few\nseconds, and then we hit stern-on, bounced and hit again. I was\nconscious up to the third time we hit.\n\nThe next thing I knew, I was hanging from my lashings from the side of\nthe boat, which had become the top, and the headlights and the lights\non the control panel were out, and Joe Kivelson was holding a\nflashlight while Abe Clifford and Glenn Murell were trying to get me\nuntied and lower me. I also noticed that the air was fresh, and very\ncold.\n\n\"Hey, we're down!\" I said, as though I were telling anybody anything\nthey didn't know. \"How many are still alive?\"\n\n\"As far as I know, all of us,\" Joe said. \"I think I have a broken\narm.\" I noticed, then, that he was holding his left arm stiffly at his\nside. Murell had a big gash on top of his head, and he was mopping\nblood from his face with his sleeve while he worked.\n\nWhen they got me down, I looked around. Somebody else was playing a\nflashlight around at the stern, which was completely smashed. It was\na miracle the rocket locker hadn't blown up, but the main miracle was\nthat all, or even any, of us were still alive.\n\nWe found a couple of lights that could be put on, and we got all of us\npicked up and the unconscious revived. One man, Dominic Silverstein,\nhad a broken leg. Joe Kivelson's arm was, as he suspected, broken,\nanother man had a fractured wrist, and Abdullah Monnahan thought a\ncouple of ribs were broken. The rest of us were in one piece, but all\nof us were cut and bruised. I felt sore all over. We also found a\nnuclear-electric heater that would work, and got it on. Tom and I\nrigged some tarpaulins to screen off the ruptured stern and keep out\nthe worst of the cold wind. After they got through setting and\nsplinting the broken bones and taping up Abdullah's ribs, Ces\u00e1rio and\nMurell got some water out of one of the butts and started boiling it\nfor coffee. I noticed that Piet Dumont had recovered his pipe and was\nsmoking it, and Joe Kivelson had his lit.\n\n\"Well, where are we?\" somebody was asking Abe Clifford.\n\nThe navigator shook his head. \"The radio's smashed, so's the receiver\nfor the locator, and so's the radio navigational equipment. I can\nstate positively, however, that we are on the north coast of Hermann\nReuch's Land.\"\n\nEverybody laughed at that except Murell. I had to explain to him that\nHermann Reuch's Land was the antarctic continent of Fenris, and hasn't\nany other coast.\n\n\"I'd say we're a good deal west of Sancerre Bay,\" Ces\u00e1rio Vieira\nhazarded. \"We can't be east of it, the way we got blown west. I think\nwe must be at least five hundred miles east of it.\"\n\n\"Don't fool yourself, Ces\u00e1rio,\" Joe Kivelson told him. \"We could have\ngotten into a turbulent updraft and been carried to the upper,\neastward winds. The altimeter was trying to keep up with the boat and\njust couldn't, half the time. We don't know where we went. I'll take\nAbe's estimate and let it go at that.\"\n\n\"Well, we're up some kind of a fjord,\" Tom said. \"I think it branches\nlike a Y, and we're up the left branch, but I won't make a point of\nthat.\"\n\n\"I can't find anything like that on this map,\" Abe Clifford said,\nafter a while.\n\nJoe Kivelson swore. \"You ought to know better than that, Abe; you know\nhow thoroughly this coast hasn't been mapped.\"\n\n\"How much good will it do us to know where we are, right now?\" I\nasked. \"If the radio's smashed, we can't give anybody our position.\"\n\n\"We might be able to fix up the engines and get the boat in the air\nagain, after the wind drops.\" Monnahan said. \"I'll take a look at them\nand see how badly they've been banged up.\"\n\n\"With the whole stern open?\" Hans Cronje asked. \"We'd freeze stiffer\nthan a gun barrel before we went a hundred miles.\"\n\n\"Then we can pack the stern full of wet snow and let it freeze,\ninstead of us,\" I suggested. \"There'll be plenty of snow before the\nwind goes down.\"\n\nJoe Kivelson looked at me for a moment. \"That would work,\" he said.\n\"How soon can you get started on the engines, Abdullah?\"\n\n\"Right away. I'll need somebody to help me, though. I can't do much\nthe way you have me bandaged up.\"\n\n\"I think we'd better send a couple of parties out,\" Ram\u00f3n Llewellyn\nsaid. \"We'll have to find a better place to stay than this boat. We\ndon't all have parkas or lined boots, and we have a couple of injured\nmen. This heater won't be enough; in about seventy hours we'd all\nfreeze to death sitting around it.\"\n\nSomebody mentioned the possibility of finding a cave.\n\n\"I doubt it,\" Llewellyn said. \"I was on an exploring expedition down\nhere, once. This is all igneous rock, mostly granite. There aren't\nmany caves. But there may be some sort of natural shelter, or\nsomething we can make into a shelter, not too far away. We have two\nhalf-ton lifters; we could use them to pile up rocks and build\nsomething. Let's make up two parties. I'll take one; Abe, you take the\nother. One of us can go up and the other can go down.\"\n\nWe picked parties, trying to get men who had enough clothing and\nhadn't been too badly banged around in the landing. Tom wanted to go\nalong, but Abdullah insisted that he stay and help with the inspection\nof the boat's engines. Finally six of us--Llewellyn, myself, Glenn\nMurell, Abe Clifford, old Piet Dumont, and another man--went out\nthrough the broken stern of the boat. We had two portable\nfloodlights--a scout boat carries a lot of equipment--and Llewellyn\ntook the one and Clifford the other. It had begun to snow already, and\nthe wind was coming straight up the narrow ravine into which we had\nlanded, driving it at us. There was a stream between the two walls of\nrock, swollen by the rains that had come just before the darkness, and\nthe rocks in and beside it were coated with ice. We took one look at\nit and shook our heads. Any exploring we did would be done without\ntrying to cross that. We stood for a few minutes trying to see through\nthe driving snow, and then we separated, Abe Clifford, Dumont and the\nother man going up the stream and Ram\u00f3n Llewellyn, Glenn Murell and I\ngoing down.\n\nA few hundred yards below the boat, the stream went over a fifty-foot\nwaterfall. We climbed down beside it, and found the ravine widening.\nIt was a level beach, now, or what had been a beach thousands of years\nago. The whole coast of Hermann Reuch's land is sinking in the Eastern\nHemisphere and rising in the Western. We turned away from the stream\nand found that the wind was increasing in strength and coming at us\nfrom the left instead of in front. The next thing we knew, we were at\nthe point of the mountain on our right and we could hear the sea\nroaring ahead and on both sides of us. Tom had been right about that\nV-shaped fjord, I thought.\n\nWe began running into scattered trees now, and when we got around the\npoint of the mountain we entered another valley.\n\nTrees, like everything else on Fenris, are considerably different from\nanything analogous on normal planets. They aren't tall, the biggest\nnot more than fifteen feet high, but they are from six to eight feet\nthick, with all the branches at the top, sprouting out in all\ndirections and reminding me of pictures of Medusa. The outside bark is\na hard shell, which grows during the beginning of our four hot\nseasons a year. Under that will be more bark, soft and spongy, and\nthis gets more and more dense toward the middle; and then comes the\nhardwood core, which may be as much as two feet thick.\n\n\"One thing, we have firewood,\" Murell said, looking at them.\n\n\"What'll we cut it with; our knives?\" I wanted to know.\n\n\"Oh, we have a sonocutter on the boat,\" Ram\u00f3n Llewellyn said. \"We can\nchop these things into thousand-pound chunks and float them to camp\nwith the lifters. We could soak the spongy stuff on the outside with\nwater and let it freeze, and build a hut out of it, too.\" He looked\naround, as far as the light penetrated the driving snow. \"This\nwouldn't be a bad place to camp.\"\n\nNot if we're going to try to work on the boat, I thought. And packing\nDominic, with his broken leg, down over that waterfall was something I\ndidn't want to try, either. I didn't say anything. Wait till we got\nback to the boat. It was too cold and windy here to argue, and\nbesides, we didn't know what Abe and his party might have found\nupstream.\n\n\n\n\n12\n\nCASTAWAYS WORKING\n\n\nWe had been away from the boat for about two hours; when we got back,\nI saw that Abdullah and his helpers had gotten the deck plates off the\nengine well and used them to build a more substantial barricade at the\nruptured stern. The heater was going and the boat was warm inside, not\njust relatively to the outside, but actually comfortable. It was even\nmore crowded, however, because there was a ton of collapsium\nshielding, in four sections, and the generator and power unit, piled\nin the middle. Abdullah and Tom and Hans Cronje were looking at the\nconverters, which to my not very knowing eye seemed to be in a\nhopeless mess.\n\nThere was some more work going on up at the front. Ces\u00e1rio Vieira had\nfound a small portable radio that wasn't in too bad condition, and had\nit apart. I thought he was doing about the most effective work of\nanybody, and waded over the pile of engine parts to see what he was\ndoing. It wasn't much of a radio. A hundred miles was the absolute\nlimit of its range, at least for sending.\n\n\"Is this all we have?\" I asked, looking at it. It was the same type as\nthe one I carried on the job, camouflaged in a camera case, except\nthat it wouldn't record.\n\n\"There's the regular boat radio, but it's smashed up pretty badly. I\nwas thinking we could do something about cannibalizing one radio out\nof parts from both of them.\"\n\nWe use a lot of radio equipment on the _Times_, and I do a good bit of\nwork on it. I started taking the big set apart and then remembered the\nreceiver for the locator and got at that, too. The trouble was that\nmost of the stuff in all the sets had been miniaturized to a point\nwhere watchmaker's tools would have been pretty large for working on\nthem, and all we had was a general-repair kit that was just about fine\nenough for gunsmithing.\n\nWhile we were fooling around with the radios, Ram\u00f3n Llewellyn was\ntelling the others what we found up the other branch of the fjord. Joe\nKivelson shook his head over it.\n\n\"That's too far from the boat. We can't trudge back and forth to work\non the engines. We could cut firewood down there and float it up with\nthe lifters, and I think that's a good idea about using slabs of the\nsoft wood to build a hut. But let's build the hut right here.\"\n\n\"Well, suppose I take a party down now and start cutting?\" the mate\nasked.\n\n\"Not yet. Wait till Abe gets back and we see what he found upstream.\nThere may be something better up there.\"\n\nTom, who had been poking around in the converters, said:\n\n\"I think we can forget about the engines. This is a machine-shop job.\nWe need parts, and we haven't anything to make them out of or with.\"\n\nThat was about what I'd thought. Tom knew more about lift-and-drive\nengines than I'd ever learn, and I was willing to take his opinion as\nconfirmation of my own.\n\n\"Tom, take a look at this mess,\" I said. \"See if you can help us with\nit.\"\n\nHe came over, looked at what we were working on, and said, \"You need a\nmagnifier for this. Wait till I see something.\" Then he went over to\none of the lockers, rummaged in it, and found a pair of binoculars. He\ncame over to us again, sat down, and began to take them apart. As soon\nas he had the two big objective lenses out, we had two fairly good\nmagnifying glasses.\n\nThat was a big help, but being able to see what had to be done was one\nthing, and having tools to do it was another. So he found a sewing kit\nand a piece of emery stone, and started making little screwdrivers out\nof needles.\n\nAfter a while, Abe Clifford and Piet Dumont and the other man returned\nand made a beeline for the heater and the coffeepot. After Abe was\nwarmed a little, he said:\n\n\"There's a little waterfall about half a mile up. It isn't too hard to\nget up over it, and above, the ground levels off into a big\nbowl-shaped depression that looks as if it had been a lake bottom,\nonce. The wind isn't so bad up there, and this whole lake bottom or\nwhatever it is is grown up with trees. It would be a good place to\nmake a camp, if it wasn't so far from the boat.\"\n\n\"How hard would it be to cut wood up there and bring it down?\" Joe\nasked, going on to explain what he had in mind.\n\n\"Why, easy. I don't think it would be nearly as hard as the place\nRam\u00f3n found.\"\n\n\"Neither do I,\" the mate agreed. \"Climbing up that waterfall down the\nstream with a half tree trunk would be a lot harder than dropping one\nover beside the one above.\" He began zipping up his parka. \"Let's get\nthe cutter and the lifters and go up now.\"\n\n\"Wait till I warm up a little, and I'll go with you,\" Abe said.\n\nThen he came over to where Ces\u00e1rio and Tom and I were working, to see\nwhat we were doing. He chucked appreciatively at the midget\nscrewdrivers and things Tom was making.\n\n\"I'll take that back, Ram\u00f3n,\" he said. \"I can do a lot more good right\nhere. Have you taken any of the radio navigational equipment apart,\nyet?\" he asked us.\n\nWe hadn't. We didn't know anything about it.\n\n\"Well, I think we can get some stuff out of the astrocompass that can\nbe used. Let me in here, will you?\"\n\nI got up. \"You take over for me,\" I said. \"I'll go on the\nwood-chopping detail.\"\n\nTom wanted to go, too; Abe told him to keep on with his toolmaking.\nPiet Dumont said he'd guide us, and Glenn Murell said he'd go along.\nThere was some swapping around of clothes and we gathered up the two\nlifters and the sonocutter and a floodlight and started upstream.\n\nThe waterfall above the boat was higher than the one below, but not\nquite so hard to climb, especially as we had the two lifters to help\nus. The worst difficulty, and the worst danger, was from the wind.\n\nOnce we were at the top, though, it wasn't so bad. We went a couple of\nhundred yards through a narrow gorge, and then we came out onto the\nold lake bottom Abe had spoken about. As far as our lights would\nshine in the snow, we could see stubby trees with snaky branches\ngrowing out of the tops.\n\nWe just started on the first one we came to, slicing the down-hanging\nbranches away to get at the trunk and then going to work on that. We\ntook turns using the sonocutter, and the rest of us stamped around to\nkeep warm. The first trunk must have weighed a ton and a half, even\nafter the branches were all off; we could barely lift one end of it\nwith both lifters. The spongy stuff, which changed from bark to wood\nas it went in to the middle, was two feet thick. We cut that off in\nslabs, to use for building the hut. The hardwood core, once we could\nget it lit, would make a fine hot fire. We could cut that into\nburnable pieces after we got it to camp. We didn't bother with the\nslashings; just threw them out of the way. There was so much big stuff\nhere that the branches weren't worth taking in.\n\nWe had eight trees down and cut into slabs and billets before we\ndecided to knock off. We didn't realize until then how tired and cold\nwe were. A couple of us had taken the wood to the waterfall and heaved\nit over at the side as fast as the others got the trees down and cut\nup. If we only had another cutter and a couple more lifters, I\nthought. If we only had an airworthy boat....\n\nWhen we got back to camp, everybody who wasn't crippled and had enough\nclothes to get away from the heater came out and helped. First, we got\na fire started--there was a small arc torch, and we needed that to get\nthe dense hardwood burning--and then we began building a hut against\nthe boat. Everybody worked on that but Dominic Silverstein. Even Abe\nand Ces\u00e1rio knocked off work on the radio, and Joe Kivelson and the\nman with the broken wrist gave us a little one-handed help. By this\ntime, the wind had fallen and the snow was coming down thicker. We\nmade snow shovels out of the hard outer bark, although they broke in\nuse pretty often, and banked snow up against the hut. I lost track of\nhow long we worked, but finally we had a place we could all get into,\nwith a fireplace, and it was as warm and comfortable as the inside of\nthe boat.\n\nWe had to keep cutting wood, though. Before long it would be too cold\nto work up in the woods, or even go back and forth between the woods\nand the camp. The snow finally stopped, and then the sky began to\nclear and we could see stars. That didn't make us happy at all. As\nlong as the sky was clouded and the snow was falling, some of the heat\nthat had been stored during the long day was being conserved. Now it\nwas all radiating away into space.\n\nThe stream froze completely, even the waterfall. In a way, that was a\nhelp; we could slide wood down over it, and some of the billets would\nslide a couple of hundred yards downstream. But the cold was getting\nto us. We only had a few men working at woodcutting--Ces\u00e1rio, and old\nPiet Dumont, and Abe Clifford and I, because we were the smallest and\ncould wear bigger men's parkas and overpants over our own. But as long\nas any of us could pile on enough clothing and waddle out of the hut,\nwe didn't dare stop. If the firewood ran out, we'd all freeze stiff in\nno time at all.\n\nAbe Clifford got the radio working, at last. It was a peculiar job as\never was, but he thought it would have a range of about five hundred\nmiles. Somebody kept at it all the time, calling Mayday. I think it\nwas Bish Ware who told me that Mayday didn't have anything to do with\nthe day after the last of April; it was Old Terran French, _m'aidez_,\nmeaning \"help me.\" I wondered how Bish was getting along, and I wasn't\ntoo optimistic about him.\n\nCes\u00e1rio and Abe and I were up at the waterfall, picking up loads of\nfirewood--we weren't bothering, now, with anything but the hard and\nslow-burning cores--and had just gotten two of them hooked onto the\nlifters. I straightened for a moment and looked around. There wasn't a\ncloud in the sky, and two of Fenris's three moons were making\neverything as bright as day. The glisten of the snow and the frozen\nwaterfall in the double moonlight was beautiful.\n\nI turned to Ces\u00e1rio. \"See what all you'll miss, if you take your next\nreincarnation off Fenris,\" I said. \"This, and the long sunsets and\nsunrises, and--\"\n\nBefore I could list any more sights unique to our planet, the 7-mm\nmachine gun, down at the boat, began hammering; a short burst, and\nthen another, and another and another.\n\n\n\n\n13\n\nTHE BEACON LIGHT\n\n\nWe all said, \"Shooting!\" and, \"The machine gun!\" as though we had to\ntell each other what it was.\n\n\"Something's attacking them,\" Ces\u00e1rio guessed.\n\n\"Oh, there isn't anything to attack them now,\" Abe said. \"All the\ncritters are dug in for the winter. I'll bet they're just using it to\nchop wood with.\"\n\nThat could be; a few short bursts would knock off all the soft wood\nfrom one of those big billets and expose the hard core. Only why\ndidn't they use the cutter? It was at the boat now.\n\n\"We better go see what it is,\" Ces\u00e1rio insisted. \"It might be\ntrouble.\"\n\nNone of us was armed; we'd never thought we'd need weapons. There are\nquite a few Fenrisian land animals, all creepers or crawlers, that are\ndangerous, but they spend the extreme hot and cold periods in burrows,\nin almost cataleptic sleep. It occurred to me that something might\nhave burrowed among the rocks near the camp and been roused by the\nheat of the fire.\n\nWe hadn't carried a floodlight with us--there was no need for one in\nthe moonlight. Of the two at camp, one was pointed up the ravine\ntoward us, and the other into the air. We began yelling as soon as we\ncaught sight of them, not wanting to be dusted over lightly with\n7-mm's before anybody recognized us. As soon as the men at the camp\nheard us, the shooting stopped and they started shouting to us. Then\nwe could distinguish words.\n\n\"Come on in! We made contact!\"\n\nWe pushed into the hut, where everybody was crowded around the\nunderhatch of the boat, which was now the side door. Abe shoved\nthrough, and I shoved in after him. Newsman's conditioned reflex; get\nto where the story is. I even caught myself saying, \"Press,\" as I\nshoved past Abdullah Monnahan.\n\n\"What happened?\" I asked, as soon as I was inside. I saw Joe Kivelson\ngetting up from the radio and making place for Abe. \"Who did you\ncontact?\"\n\n\"The Mahatma; _Helldiver_,\" he said. \"Signal's faint, but plain;\nthey're trying to make a directional fix on us. There are about a\ndozen ships out looking for us: _Helldiver_, _Pequod_, _Bulldog_,\n_Dirty Gertie_...\" He went on naming them.\n\n\"How did they find out?\" I wanted to know. \"Somebody pick up our\nMayday while we were cruising submerged?\"\n\nAbe Clifford was swearing into the radio. \"No, of course not. We don't\nknow where in Nifflheim we are. All the instruments in the boat were\nsmashed.\"\n\n\"Well, can't you shoot the stars, Abe?\" The voice--I thought it was\nFeinberg's--was almost as inaudible as a cat's sneeze.\n\n\"Sure we can. If you're in range of this makeshift set, the position\nwe'd get would be practically the same as yours,\" Abe told him. \"Look,\nthere's a floodlight pointed straight up. Can you see that?\"\n\n\"In all this moonlight? We could be half a mile away and not see it.\"\n\n\"We've been firing with a 7-mm,\" the navigator said.\n\n\"I know; I heard it. On the radio. Have you got any rockets? Maybe if\nyou shot one of them up we could see it.\"\n\n\"Hey, that's an idea! Hans, have we another rocket with an explosive\nhead?\"\n\nCronje said we had, and he and another man got it out and carried it\nfrom the boat. I repeated my question to Joe Kivelson.\n\n\"No. Your Dad tried to call the _Javelin_ by screen; that must have\nbeen after we abandoned ship. He didn't get an answer, and put out a\ngeneral call. Nip Spazoni was nearest, and he cruised around and\npicked up the locator signal and found the wreck, with the boat berth\nblown open and the boat gone. Then everybody started looking for us.\"\n\nFeinberg was saying that he'd call the other ships and alert them. If\nthe _Helldiver_ was the only ship we could contact by radio, the odds\nwere that if they couldn't see the rocket from Feinberg's ship, nobody\nelse could. The same idea must have occurred to Abe Clifford.\n\n\"You say you're all along the coast. Are the other ships west or east\nof you?\"\n\n\"West, as far as I know.\"\n\n\"Then we must be way east of you. Where are you now?\"\n\n\"About five hundred miles east of Sancerre Bay.\"\n\nThat meant we must be at least a thousand miles east of the bay. I\ncould see how that happened. Both times the boat had surfaced, it had\ngone straight up, lift and drive operating together. There is a\nconstant wind away from the sunlight zone at high level, heated air\nthat has been lifted, and there is a wind at a lower level out of the\ndark zone, coming in to replace it. We'd gotten completely above the\nlatter and into the former.\n\nThere was some yelling outside, and then I could hear Hans Cronje:\n\n\"Rocket's ready for vertical launching. Ten seconds, nine, eight,\nseven, six, five, four, three, two, one; rocket off!\"\n\nThere was a whoosh outside. Clifford, at the radio, repeated: \"Rocket\noff!\" Then it banged, high overhead. \"Did you see it? he asked.\n\n\"Didn't see a thing,\" Feinberg told him.\n\n\"Hey, I know what they would see!\" Tom Kivelson burst out. \"Say we go\nup and set the woods on fire?\"\n\n\"Hey, that's an idea. Listen, Mahatma; we have a big forest of\nflowerpot trees up on a plateau above us. Say we set that on fire.\nThink you could see it?\"\n\n\"I don't see why not, even in this moonlight. Wait a minute, till I\ncall the other ships.\"\n\nTom was getting into warm outer garments. Ces\u00e1rio got out the arc\ntorch, and he and Tom and I raced out through the hut and outdoors.\nWe hastened up the path that had been tramped and dragged to the\nwaterfall, got the lifters off the logs, and used them to help\nourselves up over the rocks beside the waterfall.\n\nWe hadn't bothered doing anything with the slashings, except to get\nthem out of our way, while we were working. Now we gathered them into\npiles among the trees, placing them to take advantage of what little\nwind was still blowing, and touched them off with the arc torch. Soon\nwe had the branches of the trees burning, and then the soft outer wood\nof the trunks. It actually began to get uncomfortably hot, although\nthe temperature was now down around minus 90\u00b0 Fahrenheit.\n\nCes\u00e1rio was using the torch. After he got all the slashings on fire,\nhe started setting fire to the trees themselves, going all around them\nand getting the soft outer wood burning. As soon as he had one tree\nlit, he would run on to another.\n\n\"This guy's a real pyromaniac,\" Tom said to me, wiping his face on the\nsleeve of his father's parka which he was wearing over his own.\n\n\"Sure I am,\" Ces\u00e1rio took time out to reply. \"You know who I was about\nfifty reincarnations ago? Nero, burning Rome.\" Theosophists never\nhesitated to make fun of their religion, that way. The way they see\nit, a thing isn't much good if it can't stand being made fun of. \"And\nlook at the job I did on Moscow, a little later.\"\n\n\"Sure; I remember that. I was Napoleon then. What I'd have done to you\nif I'd caught you, too.\"\n\n\"Yes, and I know what he was in another reincarnation,\" Tom added.\n\"Mrs. O'Leary's cow!\"\n\nWhether or not Ces\u00e1rio really had had any past astral experience, he\nmade a good job of firebugging on this forest. We waited around for a\nwhile, far enough back for the heat to be just comfortable and\npleasant, until we were sure that it was burning well on both sides of\nthe frozen stream. It even made the double moonlight dim, and it was\nsending up huge clouds of fire-reddened smoke, and where the fire\ndidn't light the smoke, it was black in the moonlight. There wouldn't\nbe any excuse for anybody not seeing that. Finally, we started back to\ncamp.\n\nAs soon as we got within earshot, we could hear the excitement.\nEverybody was jumping and yelling. \"They see it! They see it!\"\n\nThe boat was full of voices, too, from the radio:\n\n\"_Pequod_ to _Dirty Gertie_, we see it, too, just off our port bow...\nYes, _Bulldog_, we see your running lights; we're right behind you...\n_Slasher_ to _Pequod_: we can't see you at all. Fire a flare,\nplease...\"\n\nI pushed in to the radio. \"This is Walter Boyd, _Times_ representative\nwith the _Javelin_ castaways,\" I said. \"Has anybody a portable\naudiovisual pickup that I can use to get some pictures in to my paper\nwith?\"\n\nThat started general laughter among the operators on the ships that\nwere coming in.\n\n\"We have one, Walt,\" Oscar Fujisawa's voice told me. \"I'm coming in\nahead in the _Pequod_ scout boat; I'll bring it with me.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Oscar,\" I said. Then I asked him: \"Did you see Bish Ware\nbefore you left port?\"\n\n\"I should say I did!\" Oscar told me. \"You can thank Bish Ware that\nwe're out looking for you now. Tell you about it as soon as we get\nin.\"\n\n\n\n\n14\n\nTHE RESCUE\n\n\nThe scout boat from the _Pequod_ came in about thirty minutes later,\nfrom up the ravine where the forest fire was sending up flame and\nsmoke. It passed over the boat and the hut beside it and the crowd of\nus outside, and I could see Oscar in the machine gunner's seat aiming\na portable audiovisual telecast camera. After he got a view of us,\ncheering and waving our arms, the boat came back and let down. We ran\nto it, all of us except the man with the broken leg and a couple who\ndidn't have enough clothes to leave the fire, and as the boat opened I\ncould hear Oscar saying:\n\n\"Now I am turning you over to Walter Boyd, the _Times_ correspondent\nwith the _Javelin_ castaways.\"\n\nHe gave me the camera when he got out, followed by his gunner, and I\ngot a view of them, and of the boat lifting and starting west to guide\nthe ships in. Then I shut it off and said to him:\n\n\"What's this about Bish Ware? You said he was the one who started the\nsearch.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Oscar said. \"About thirty hours after you left port,\nhe picked up some things that made him think the _Javelin_ had been\nsabotaged. He went to your father, and he contacted me--Mohandas\nFeinberg and I still had our ships in port--and started calling the\n_Javelin_ by screen. When he couldn't get response, your father put\nout a general call to all hunter-ships. Nip Spazoni reported boarding\nthe _Javelin_, and then went searching the area where he thought you'd\nbeen hunting, picked up your locator signal, and found the _Javelin_\non the bottom with her bow blown out and the boat berth open and the\nboat gone. We all figured you'd head south with the boat, and that's\nwhere we went to look.\"\n\n\"Well, Bish Ware; he was dead drunk, last I heard of him,\" Joe\nKivelson said.\n\n\"Aah, just an act,\" Oscar said. \"That was to fool the city cops, and\nanybody else who needed fooling. It worked so well that he was able to\ncrash a party Steve Ravick was throwing at Hunters' Hall, after the\nmeeting. That was where he picked up some hints that Ravick had a spy\nin the _Javelin_ crew. He spent the next twenty or so hours following\nthat up, and heard about your man Devis straining his back. He found\nout what Devis did on the _Javelin_, and that gave him the idea that\nwhatever the sabotage was, it would be something to the engines. What\ndid happen, by the way?\"\n\nA couple of us told him, interrupting one another. He nodded.\n\n\"That was what Nip Spazoni thought when he looked at the ship. Well,\nafter that he talked to your father and to me, and then your father\nbegan calling and we heard from Nip.\"\n\nYou could see that it absolutely hurt Joe Kivelson to have to owe his\nlife to Bish Ware.\n\n\"Well, it's lucky anybody listened to him,\" he grudged. \"I wouldn't\nhave.\"\n\n\"No, I guess maybe you wouldn't,\" Oscar told him, not very cordially.\n\"I think he did a mighty sharp piece of detective work, myself.\"\n\nI nodded, and then, all of a sudden, another idea, under _Bish Ware,\nReformation of_, hit me. Detective work; that was it. We could use a\ngood private detective agency in Port Sandor. Maybe I could talk him\ninto opening one. He could make a go of it. He had all kinds of\ncontacts, he was handy with a gun, and if he recruited a couple of\ntough but honest citizens who were also handy with guns and built up a\nprotective and investigative organization, it would fill a long-felt\nneed and at the same time give him something beside Baldur honey-rum\nto take his mind off whatever he was drinking to keep from thinking\nabout. If he only stayed sober half the time, that would be a fifty\nper cent success.\n\nRam\u00f3n Llewellyn was wanting to know whether anybody'd done anything\nabout Al Devis.\n\n\"We didn't have time to bother with any Al Devises,\" Oscar said. \"As\nsoon as Bish figured out what had happened aboard the _Javelin_, we\nknew you'd need help and need it fast. He's keeping an eye on Al for\nus till we get back.\"\n\n\"That's if he doesn't get any drunker and forget,\" Joe said.\n\nEverybody, even Tom, looked at him in angry reproach.\n\n\"We better find out what he drinks and buy you a jug of it, Joe,\"\nOscar's gunner told him.\n\nThe _Helldiver_, which had been closest to us when our signal had\nbeen picked up, was the first ship in. She let down into the ravine,\nafter some maneuvering around, and Mohandas Feinberg and half a dozen\nof his crew got off with an improvised stretcher on a lifter and a lot\nof blankets. We got our broken-leg case aboard, and Abdullah Monnahan,\nand the man with the broken wrist. There were more ships coming, so\nthe rest of us waited. Joe Kivelson should have gone on the\n_Helldiver_, to have his broken arm looked at, but a captain's always\nthe last man off, so he stayed.\n\nOscar said he'd take Tom and Joe, and Glenn Murell and me, on the\n_Pequod_. I was glad of that. Oscar and his mate and his navigator are\nall bachelors, and they use the _Pequod_ to throw parties on when\nthey're not hunting, so it is more comfortably fitted than the usual\nhunter-ship. Joe decided not to try to take anything away from the\nboat. He was going to do something about raising the _Javelin_, and\nthe salvage ship could stop here and pick everything up.\n\n\"Well, one thing,\" Oscar told him. \"Bring that machine gun, and what\nsmall arms you have. I think things are going to get sort of rough in\nPort Sandor, in the next twenty or so hours.\"\n\nI was beginning to think so, myself. The men who had gotten off the\n_Helldiver_, and the ones who got off Corkscrew Finnegan's _Dirty\nGertie_ and Nip Spazoni's _Bulldog_ were all talking about what was\ngoing to have to be done about Steve Ravick. Bombing _Javelin_ would\nhave been a good move for Ravick, if it had worked. It hadn't, though,\nand now it was likely to be the thing that would finish him for good.\n\nIt wasn't going to be any picnic, either. He had his gang of\nhoodlums, and he could count on Morton Hallstock's twenty or thirty\ncity police; they'd put up a fight, and a hard one. And they were all\ntogether, and the hunter fleet was coming in one ship at a time. I\nwondered if the Ravick-Hallstock gang would try to stop them at the\nwater front, or concentrate at Hunters' Hall or the Municipal Building\nto stand siege. I knew one thing, though. However things turned out,\nthere was going to be an awful lot of shooting in Port Sandor before\nit was over.\n\nFinally, everybody had been gotten onto one ship or another but Oscar\nand his gunner and the Kivelsons and Murell and myself. Then the\n_Pequod_, which had been circling around at five thousand feet, let\ndown and we went aboard. The conning tower was twice as long as usual\non a hunter-ship, and furnished with a lot of easy chairs and a couple\nof couches. There was a big combination view and communication screen,\nand I hurried to that and called the _Times_.\n\nDad came on, as soon as I finished punching the wave-length\ncombination. He was in his shirt sleeves, and he was wearing a gun. I\nguess we made kind of a show of ourselves, but, after all, he'd come\nwithin an ace of being all out of family, and I'd come within an ace\nof being all out, period. After we got through with the happy reunion,\nI asked him what was the situation in Port Sandor. He shook his head.\n\n\"Not good, Walt. The word's gotten around that there was a bomb\nplanted aboard the _Javelin_, and everybody's taking just one guess\nwho did it. We haven't expressed any opinions one way or another,\nyet. We've been waiting for confirmation.\"\n\n\"Set for recording,\" I said. \"I'll give you the story as far as we\nknow it.\"\n\nHe nodded, reached one hand forward out of the picture, and then\nnodded again. I began with our killing the monster and going down to\nthe bottom after the cutting-up, and the explosion. I told him what we\nhad seen after leaving the ship and circling around it in the boat.\n\n\"The condition of the hull looked very much like the effect of a\ncharge of high explosive exploding in the engine room,\" I finished.\n\n\"We got some views of it, transmitted in by Captain Spazoni, of the\n_Bulldog_,\" he said. \"Captain Courtland, of the Spaceport Police, has\nexpressed the opinion that it could hardly be anything but a small\ndemolition bomb. Would you say accident can be ruled out?\"\n\n\"I would. There was nobody in the engine room at the time; we were\nresting on the bottom, and all hands were in the wardroom.\"\n\n\"That's good enough,\" Dad said. \"We'll run it as 'very convincing and\nalmost conclusive' evidence of sabotage.\" He'd shut off the recorder\nfor that. \"Can I get the story of how you abandoned ship and landed,\nnow?\"\n\nHis hand moved forward, and the recorder went on again. I gave a brief\naccount of our experiences in the boat, the landing and wreck, and our\ncamp, and the firewood cutting, and how we had repaired the radio. Joe\nKivelson talked for a while, and so did Tom and Glenn Murell. I was\ngoing to say something when they finished, and I sat down on one of\nthe couches. I distinctly remember leaning back and relaxing.\n\nThe next thing I knew, Oscar Fujisawa's mate was shaking me awake.\n\n\"We're in sight of Port Sandor,\" he was telling me.\n\nI mumbled something, and then sat up and found that I had been lying\ndown and that somebody had thrown a blanket over me. Tom Kivelson was\nstill asleep under a blanket on the other couch, across from me. The\nclock over the instrument panel had moved eight G.S. hours. Joe\nKivelson wasn't in sight, but Glenn Murell and Oscar were drinking\ncoffee. I went to the front window, and there was a scarlet glow on\nthe horizon ahead of me.\n\nThat's another sight Ces\u00e1rio Vieria will miss, if he takes his next\nreincarnation off Fenris. Really, it's nothing but damp, warm air,\nblown up from the exhaust of the city's main ventilation plant,\ncondensing and freezing as it hits the cold air outside, and\nfloodlighted from below. I looked at it for a while, and then got\nmyself a cup of coffee and when I had finished it I went to the\nscreen.\n\nIt was still tuned to the _Times_, and Mohandas Feinberg was sitting\nin front of it, smoking one of his twisted black cigars. He had a big\n10-mm Sterberg stuffed into the waistband of his trousers.\n\n\"You guys poked along,\" he said. \"I always thought the _Pequod_ was\nfast. We got in three hours ago.\"\n\n\"Who else is in?\"\n\n\"Corkscrew and some of his gang are here at the _Times_, now.\n_Bulldog_ and _Slasher_ just got in a while ago. Some of the ships\nthat were farthest west and didn't go to your camp have been in quite\na while. We're having a meeting here. We are organizing the Port\nSandor Vigilance Committee and Renegade Hunters' Co-operative.\"\n\n\n\n\n15\n\nVIGILANTES\n\n\nWhen the _Pequod_ surfaced under the city roof, I saw what was\ncooking. There were twenty or more ships, either on the concrete docks\nor afloat in the pools. The waterfront was crowded with men in boat\nclothes, forming little knots and breaking up to join other groups,\nall milling about talking excitedly. Most of them were armed; not just\nknives and pistols, which is normal costume, but heavy rifles or\nsubmachine guns. Down to the left, there was a commotion and people\nwere getting out of the way as a dozen men come pushing through,\ntowing a contragravity skid with a 50-mm ship's gun on it. I began not\nliking the looks of things, and Glenn Murell, who had come up from his\nnap below, was liking it even less. He'd come to Fenris to buy\ntallow-wax, not to fight a civil war. I didn't want any of that stuff,\neither. Getting rid of Ravick, Hallstock and Belsher would come under\nthe head of civic improvements, but towns are rarely improved by\nhaving battles fought in them.\n\nMaybe I should have played dumb and waited till I'd talked to Dad face\nto face, before making any statements about what had happened on the\n_Javelin_, I thought. Then I shrugged that off. From the minute the\n_Javelin_ had failed to respond to Dad's screen-call and the general\ncall had gone out to the hunter-fleet, everybody had been positive of\nwhat had happened. It was too much like the loss of the _Claymore_,\nwhich had made Ravick president of the Co-op.\n\nPort Sandor had just gotten all of Steve Ravick that anybody could\ntake. They weren't going to have any more of him, and that was all\nthere was to it.\n\nJoe Kivelson was grumbling about his broken arm; that meant that when\na fight started, he could only go in swinging with one fist, and that\nwould cut the fun in half. Another reason why Joe is a wretched shot\nis that he doesn't like pistols. They're a little too impersonal to\nsuit him. They weren't for Oscar Fujisawa; he had gotten a\nMars-Consolidated Police Special out of the chart-table drawer and put\nit on, and he was loading cartridges into a couple of spare clips.\nDown on the main deck, the gunner was serving out small arms, and\nthere was an acrimonious argument because everybody wanted a chopper\nand there weren't enough choppers to go around. Oscar went over to the\nladder head and shouted down at them.\n\n\"Knock off the argument, down there; you people are all going to stay\non the ship. I'm going up to the _Times_; as soon as I'm off, float\nher out into the inner channel and keep her afloat, and don't let\nanybody aboard you're not sure of.\"\n\n\"That where we're going?\" Joe Kivelson asked.\n\n\"Sure. That's the safest place in town for Mr. Murell and I want to\nfind out exactly what's going on here.\"\n\n\"Well, here; you don't need to put me in storage,\" Murell protested.\n\"I can take care of myself.\"\n\nAdd, Famous Last Words, I thought.\n\n\"I'm sure of it, but we can't take any chances,\" Oscar told him.\n\"Right now, you are Fenris's Indispensable Man. If you're not around\nto buy tallow-wax, Ravick's won the war.\"\n\nOscar and Murell and Joe and Tom Kivelson and I went down into the\nboat; somebody opened the port and we floated out and lifted onto the\nSecond Level Down. There was a fringe of bars and cafes and dance\nhalls and outfitters and ship chandlers for a couple of blocks back,\nand then we ran into the warehouse district. Oscar ran up town to a\nvehicle shaft above the Times Building, careful to avoid the\nneighborhood of Hunters' Hall or the Municipal Building.\n\nThere was a big crowd around the _Times_, mostly business district\npeople and quite a few women. They were mostly out on the street and\ninside the street-floor vehicle port. Not a disorderly crowd, but I\nnoticed quite a few rifles and submachine guns. As we slipped into the\nvehicle port, they recognized the _Pequod's_ boat, and there was a\nrush after it. We had trouble getting down without setting it on\nanybody, and more trouble getting out of it. They were all\nfriendly--too friendly for comfort. They began cheering us as soon as\nthey saw us.\n\nOscar got Joe Kivelson, with his arm in a sling, out in front where he\ncould be seen, and began shouting: \"Please make way; this man's been\ninjured. Please don't crowd; we have an injured man here.\" The crowd\nbegan shoving back, and in the rear I could hear them taking it up:\n\"Joe Kivelson; he's been hurt. They're carrying Joe Kivelson off.\"\nThat made Joe curse a blue streak, and somebody said, \"Oh, he's been\nhurt real bad; just listen to him!\"\n\nWhen we got up to the editorial floor, Dad and Bish Ware and a few\nothers were waiting at the elevator for us. Bish was dressed as he\nalways was, in his conservative black suit, with the organic opal\nglowing in his neckcloth. Dad had put a coat on over his gun. Julio was\nwearing two pistols and a knife a foot long. There was a big crowd in\nthe editorial office--ships' officers, merchants, professional people. I\nnoticed Sigurd Ngozori, the banker, and Professor Hartzenbosch--he was\nwearing a pistol, too, rather self-consciously--and the Zen Buddhist\npriest, who evidently had something under his kimono. They all greeted\nus enthusiastically and shook hands with us. I noticed that Joe Kivelson\nwas something less than comfortable about shaking hands with Bish Ware.\nThe fact that Bish had started the search for the _Javelin_ that had\nsaved our lives didn't alter the opinion Joe had formed long ago that\nBish was just a worthless old souse. Joe's opinions are all\ncollapsium-plated and impervious to outside influence.\n\nI got Bish off to one side as we were going into the editorial room.\n\n\"How did you get onto it?\" I asked.\n\nHe chuckled deprecatingly. \"No trick at all,\" he said. \"I just\ncirculated and bought drinks for people. The trouble with Ravick's\ngang, it's an army of mercenaries. They'll do anything for the price\nof a drink, and as long as my rich uncle stays solvent, I always have\nthe price of a drink. In the five years I've spent in this Garden Spot\nof the Galaxy, I've learned some pretty surprising things about Steve\nRavick's operations.\"\n\n\"Well, surely, nobody was going around places like Martian Joe's or\nOne Eye Swanson's boasting that they'd put a time bomb aboard the\n_Javelin_,\" I said.\n\n\"It came to pretty nearly that,\" Bish said. \"You'd be amazed at how\ncareless people who've had their own way for a long time can get. For\ninstance, I've known for some time that Ravick has spies among the\ncrews of a lot of hunter-ships. I tried, a few times, to warn some of\nthese captains, but except for Oscar Fujisawa and Corkscrew Finnegan,\nnone of them would listen to me. It wasn't that they had any doubt\nthat Ravick would do that; they just wouldn't believe that any of\ntheir crew were traitors.\n\n\"I've suspected this Devis for a long time, and I've spoken to Ram\u00f3n\nLlewellyn about him, but he just let it go in one ear and out the\nother. For one thing, Devis always has more money to spend than his\nshare of the _Javelin_ take would justify. He's the showoff type;\nalways buying drinks for everybody and playing the big shot. Claims to\nwin it gambling, but all the times I've ever seen him gambling, he's\nbeen losing.\n\n\"I knew about this hoard of wax we saw the day Murell came in for some\ntime. I always thought it was being held out to squeeze a better price\nout of Belsher and Ravick. Then this friend of mine with whom I was\ntalking aboard the _Peenem\u00fcnde_ mentioned that Murell seemed to know\nmore about the tallow-wax business than about literary matters, and\nafter what happened at the meeting and afterward, I began putting two\nand two together. When I crashed that party at Hunters' Hall, I heard\na few things, and they all added up.\n\n\"And then, about thirty hours after the Javelin left port, I was in\nthe Happy Haven, and who should I see, buying drinks for the house,\nbut Al Devis. I let him buy me one, and he told me he'd strained his\nback hand-lifting a power-unit cartridge. A square dance got started a\nlittle later, and he got into it. His back didn't look very strained\nto me. And then I heard a couple of characters in One Eye Swanson's\nbetting that the _Javelin_ would never make port again.\"\n\nI knew what had happened from then on. If it hadn't been for Bish\nWare, we'd still be squatting around a fire down on the coast of\nHermann Reuch's Land till it got too cold to cut wood, and then we'd\nfreeze. I mentioned that, but Bish just shrugged it off and suggested\nwe go on in and see what was happening inside.\n\n\"Where is Al Devis?\" I asked. \"A lot of people want to talk to him.\"\n\n\"I know they do. I want to get to him first, while he's still in\ncondition to do some talking of his own. But he just dropped out of\nsight, about the time your father started calling the _Javelin_.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" I drew a finger across under my chin, and mentioned the class of\npeople who tell no tales. Bish shook his head slowly.\n\n\"I doubt it,\" he said. \"Not unless it was absolutely necessary. That\nsort of thing would have a discouraging effect the next time Ravick\nwanted a special job done. I'm pretty sure he isn't at Hunters' Hall,\nbut he's hiding somewhere.\"\n\nJoe Kivelson had finished telling what had happened aboard the\n_Javelin_ when we joined the main crowd, and everybody was talking\nabout what ought to be done with Steve Ravick. Oddly enough, the most\nbloodthirsty were the banker and the professor. Well, maybe it wasn't\nso odd. They were smart enough to know what Steve Ravick was really\ndoing to Port Sandor, and it hurt them as much as it did the hunters.\nDad and Bish seemed to be the only ones present who weren't in favor\nof going down to Hunters' Hall right away and massacring everybody in\nit, and then doing the same at the Municipal Building.\n\n\"That's what I say!\" Joe Kivelson was shouting. \"Let's go clean out\nboth rats' nests. Why, there must be a thousand hunter-ship men at the\nwaterfront, and look how many people in town who want to help. We got\nenough men to eat Hunters' Hall whole.\"\n\n\"You'll find it slightly inedible, Joe,\" Bish told him. \"Ravick has\nabout thirty men of his own and fifteen to twenty city police. He has\nat least four 50-mm's on the landing stage above, and he has half a\ndozen heavy machine guns and twice that many light 7-mm's.\"\n\n\"Bish is right,\" somebody else said. \"They have the vehicle port on\nthe street level barricaded, and they have the two floors on the level\nbelow sealed off. We got men all around it and nobody can get out, but\nif we try to blast our way in, it's going to cost us like Nifflheim.\"\n\n\"You mean you're just going to sit here and talk about it and not do\nanything?\" Joe demanded.\n\n\"We're going to do something, Joe,\" Dad told him. \"But we've got to\ntalk about what we're going to do, and how we're going to do it, or\nit'll be us who'll get wiped out.\"\n\n\"Well, we'll have to decide on what it'll be, pretty quick,\" Mohandas\nGandhi Feinberg said.\n\n\"What are things like at the Municipal Building?\" Oscar Fujisawa\nasked. \"You say Ravick has fifteen to twenty city cops at Hunters'\nHall. Where are the rest of them? That would only be five to ten.\"\n\n\"At the Municipal Building,\" Bish said. \"Hallstock's holed up there,\ntrying to pretend that nothing out of the ordinary is happening.\"\n\n\"Good. Let's go to the Municipal Building, first,\" Oscar said. \"Take a\ncouple of hundred men, make a lot of noise, shoot out a few windows\nand all yell, 'Hang Mort Hallstock!' loud enough, and he'll recall the\ncops he has at Hunters' Hall to save his own neck. Then the rest of us\ncan make a quick rush and take Hunters' Hall.\"\n\n\"We'll have to keep our main force around Hunters' Hall while we're\ndemonstrating at the Municipal Building,\" Corkscrew Finnegan said. \"We\ncan't take a chance on Ravick's getting away.\"\n\n\"I couldn't care less whether he gets away or not,\" Oscar said. \"I\ndon't want Steve Ravick's blood. I just want him out of the\nCo-operative, and if he runs out from it now, he'll never get back\nin.\"\n\n\"You want him, and you want him alive,\" Bish Ware said. \"Ravick has\nclose to four million sols banked on Terra. Every millisol of that's\nmoney he's stolen from the monster-hunters of this planet, through the\nCo-operative. If you just take him out and string him up, you'll have\nthe Nifflheim of a time getting hold of any of it.\"\n\nThat made sense to all the ship captains, even Joe Kivelson, after Dad\nreminded him of how much the salvage job on the _Javelin_ was going to\ncost. It took Sigurd Ngozori a couple of minutes to see the point, but\nthen, hanging Steve Ravick wasn't going to cost the Fidelity & Trust\nCompany anything.\n\n\"Well, this isn't my party,\" Glenn Murell said, \"but I'm too much of a\nbusinessman to see how watching somebody kick on the end of a rope is\nworth four million sols.\"\n\n\"Four million sols,\" Bish said, \"and wondering, the rest of your\nlives, whether it was justice or just murder.\"\n\nThe Buddhist priest looked at him, a trifle startled. After all, he\nwas the only clergyman in the crowd; he ought to have thought of that,\ninstead of this outrageous mock-bishop.\n\n\"I think it's a good scheme,\" Dad said. \"Don't mass any more men\naround Hunters' Hall than necessary. You don't want the police to be\nafraid to leave when Hallstock calls them in to help him at Municipal\nBuilding.\"\n\nBish Ware rose. \"I think I'll see what I can do at Hunters' Hall, in\nthe meantime,\" he said. \"I'm going to see if there's some way in from\nthe First or Second Level Down. Walt, do you still have that sleep-gas\ngadget of yours?\"\n\nI nodded. It was, ostensibly, nothing but an oversized pocket lighter,\njust the sort of a thing a gadget-happy kid would carry around. It\nworked perfectly as a lighter, too, till you pushed in on a little\ngismo on the side. Then, instead of producing a flame, it squirted\nout a small jet of sleep gas. It would knock out a man; it would\nalmost knock out a Zarathustra veldtbeest. I'd bought it from a\nspaceman on the _Cape Canaveral_. I'd always suspected that he'd\nstolen it on Terra, because it was an expensive little piece of work,\nbut was I going to ride a bicycle six hundred and fifty light-years to\nfind out who it belonged to? One of the chemists' shops at Port Sandor\nmade me up some fills for it, and while I had never had to use it, it\nwas a handy thing to have in some of the places I had to follow\nstories into, and it wouldn't do anybody any permanent damage, the way\na gun would.\n\n\"Yes; it's down in my room. I'll get it for you,\" I said.\n\n\"Be careful, Bish,\" Dad said. \"That gang would kill you sooner than\nlook at you.\"\n\n\"Who, me?\" Bish staggered into a table and caught hold of it. \"Who'd\nwanna hurt me? I'm just good ol' Bish Ware. _Good_ ol' Bish! nobody\nhurt him; he'sh everybody's friend.\" He let go of the table and\nstaggered into a chair, upsetting it. Then he began to sing:\n\n    \"_Come all ye hardy spacemen, and harken while I tell\n    Of fluorine-tainted Nifflheim, the Planetary Hell._\"\n\nInvoluntarily, I began clapping my hands. It was a superb piece of\nacting--Bish Ware sober playing Bish Ware drunk, and that's not an\neasy role for anybody to play. Then he picked up the chair and sat\ndown on it.\n\n\"Who do you have around Hunters' Hall, and how do I get past them?\"\nhe asked. \"I don't want a clipful from somebody on my own side.\"\n\nNip Spazoni got a pencil and a pad of paper and began drawing a plan.\n\n\"This is Second Level Down,\" he said. \"We have a car here, with a\ncouple of men in it. It's watching this approach here. And we have a\nship's boat, over here, with three men in it, and a 7-mm machine gun.\nAnd another car--no, a jeep, here. Now, up on the First Level Down, we\nhave two ships' boats, one here, and one here. The password is\n'Exotic,' and the countersign is 'Organics.'\" He grinned at Murell.\n\"Compliment to your company.\"\n\n\"Good enough. I'll want a bottle of liquor. My breath needs a little\ntouching up, and I may want to offer somebody a drink. If I could get\ninside that place, there's no telling what I might be able to do. If\none man can get in and put a couple of guards to sleep, an army can\nget in after him.\"\n\nBrother, I thought, if he pulls this one off, he's in. Nobody around\nPort Sandor will ever look down on Bish Ware again, not even Joe\nKivelson. I began thinking about the detective agency idea again, and\nwondered if he'd want a junior partner. Ware & Boyd, Planetwide\nDetective Agency.\n\nI went down to the floor below with him and got him my lighter\ngas-projector and a couple of spare fills for it, and found the bottle\nof Baldur honey-rum that Dad had been sure was around somewhere. I was\nkind of doubtful about that, and he noticed my hesitation in giving it\nto him and laughed.\n\n\"Don't worry, Walt,\" he said. \"This is strictly for protective\ncoloration--and odoration. I shall be quite sparing with it, I assure\nyou.\"\n\nI shook hands with him, trying not to be too solemn about it, and he\nwent down in the elevator and I went up the stairs to the floor above.\nBy this time, the Port Sandor Vigilance Committee had gotten itself\nsorted out. The rank-and-file Vigilantes were standing around yacking\nat one another, and a smaller group--Dad and Sigurd Ngozori and the\nReverend Sugitsuma and Oscar and Joe and Corkscrew and Nip and the\nMahatma--were in a huddle around Dad's editorial table, discussing\nstrategy and tactics.\n\n\"Well, we'd better get back to the docks before it starts,\" Corkscrew\nwas saying. \"No hunter crew will follow anybody but their own ships'\nofficers.\"\n\n\"We'll have to have somebody the uptown people will follow,\" Oscar\nsaid. \"These people won't take orders from a woolly-pants hunter\ncaptain. How about you, Sigurd?\"\n\nThe banker shook his head. \"Ralph Boyd's the man for that,\" he said.\n\n\"Ralph's needed right here; this is G.H.Q.,\" Oscar said. \"This is a\njob that's going to have to be run from one central command. We've got\nto make sure the demonstration against Hallstock and the operation\nagainst Hunters' Hall are synchronized.\"\n\n\"I have about a hundred and fifty workmen, and they all have or can\nget something to shoot with,\" another man said. I looked around, and\nsaw that it was Casmir Oughourlian, of Rodriguez & Oughourlian\nShipyards. \"They'll follow me, but I'm not too well known uptown.\"\n\n\"Hey, Professor Hartzenbosch,\" Mohandas Feinberg said. \"You're a\nrespectable-looking duck; you ever have any experience leading a\nlynch mob?\"\n\nEverybody laughed. So, to his credit, did the professor.\n\n\"I've had a lot of experience with children,\" the professor said.\n\"Children are all savages. So are lynch mobs. Things that are equal to\nthe same thing are equal to one another. Yes, I'd say so.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Dad said. \"Say I'm Chief of Staff, or something. Oscar,\nyou and Joe and Corkscrew and the rest of you decide who's going to\ntake over-all command of the hunters. Casmir, you'll command your\nworkmen, and anybody else from the shipyards and engine works and\nrepair shops and so on. Sigurd, you and the Reverend, here, and\nProfessor Hartzenbosch gather up all the uptown people you can. Now,\nwe'll have to decide on how much force we need to scare Mort\nHallstock, and how we're going to place the main force that will\nattack Hunters' Hall.\"\n\n\"I think we ought to wait till we see what Bish Ware can do,\" Oscar\nsaid. \"Get our gangs together, and find out where we're going to put\nwho, but hold off the attack for a while. If he can get inside\nHunters' Hall, we may not even need this demonstration at the\nMunicipal Building.\"\n\nJoe Kivelson started to say something. The rest of his fellow ship\ncaptains looked at him severely, and he shut up. Dad kept on jotting\ndown figures of men and 50-mm guns and vehicles and auto weapons we\nhad available.\n\nHe was still doing it when the fire alarm started.\n\n\n\n\n16\n\nCIVIL WAR POSTPONED\n\n\nThe moaner went on for thirty seconds, like a banshee mourning its\nnearest and dearest. It was everywhere, Main City Level and the four\nlevels below. What we have in Port Sandor is a volunteer fire\norganization--or disorganization, rather--of six independent\ncompanies, each of which cherishes enmity for all the rest. It's the\nbest we can do, though; if we depended on the city government, we'd\nhave no fire protection at all. They do have a central alarm system,\nthough, and the _Times_ is connected with that.\n\nThen the moaner stopped, and there were four deep whistle blasts for\nFourth Ward, and four more shrill ones for Bottom Level. There was an\ninstant's silence, and then a bedlam of shouts from the hunter-boat\ncaptains. That was where the tallow-wax that was being held out from\nthe Co-operative was stored.\n\n\"Shut up!\" Dad roared, the loudest I'd ever heard him speak. \"Shut up\nand listen!\"\n\n\"Fourth Ward, Bottom Level,\" a voice from the fire-alarm speaker said.\n\"This is a tallow-wax fire. It is not the Co-op wax; it is wax stored\nin an otherwise disused area. It is dangerously close to stored 50-mm\ncannon ammunition, and it is directly under the pulpwood lumber plant,\non the Third Level Down, and if the fire spreads up to that, it will\nendanger some of the growing vats at the carniculture plant on the\nSecond Level Down. I repeat, this is a tallow-wax fire. Do not use\nwater or chemical extinguishers.\"\n\nAbout half of the Vigilantes, businessmen who belonged to one or\nanother of the volunteer companies had bugged out for their fire\nstations already. The Buddhist priest and a couple of doctors were\nalso leaving. The rest, mostly hunter-ship men, were standing around\nlooking at one another.\n\nOscar Fujisawa gave a sour laugh. \"That diversion idea of mine was all\nright,\" he said. \"The only trouble was that Steve Ravick thought of it\nfirst.\"\n\n\"You think he started the fire?\" Dad began, and then gave a sourer\nlaugh than Oscar's. \"Am I dumb enough to ask that?\"\n\nI had started assembling equipment as soon as the feint on the\nMunicipal Building and the attack on Hunters' Hall had gotten into the\ndiscussion stage. I would use a jeep that had a heavy-duty audiovisual\nrecording and transmitting outfit on it, and for situations where I'd\nhave to leave the jeep and go on foot, I had a lighter outfit like the\none Oscar had brought with him in the Pequod's boat. Then I had my\nradio for two-way conversation with the office. And, because this\nwasn't likely to be the sort of war in which the rights of\nnoncombatants like war correspondents would be taken very seriously,\nI had gotten out my Sterberg 7.7-mm.\n\nDad saw me buckling it on, and seemed rather distressed.\n\n\"Better leave that, Walt,\" he said. \"You don't want to get into any\nshooting.\"\n\nLogical, I thought. If you aren't prepared for something, it just\nwon't happen. There's an awful lot of that sort of thinking going on.\nAs I remember my Old Terran history, it was even indulged in by\ngovernments, at one time. None of them exists now.\n\n\"You know what all crawls into the Bottom Level,\" I reminded him. \"If\nyou don't, ask Mr. Murell, here. One sent him to the hospital.\"\n\nDad nodded; I had a point there. The abandoned sections of Bottom\nLevel are full of tread-snails and other assorted little nasties, and\nthe heat of the fire would stir them all up and start them moving\naround. Even aside from the possibility that, having started the fire,\nSteve Ravick's gang would try to take steps to keep it from being put\nout too soon, a gun was going to be a comforting companion, down\nthere.\n\n\"Well, stay out of any fighting. Your job's to get the news, not play\nhero in gun fights. I'm no hero; that's why I'm sixty years old. I\nnever knew many heroes that got that old.\"\n\nIt was my turn to nod. On that, Dad had a point. I said something\nabout getting the news, not making it, and checked the chamber and\nmagazine of the Sterberg, and then slung my radio and picked up the\naudiovisual outfit.\n\nTom and Joe Kivelson had left already, to round up the scattered\nJavelin crew for fire fighting. The attack on the Municipal Building\nand on Hunters' Hall had been postponed, but it wasn't going to be\nabandoned. Oscar and Professor Hartzenbosch and Dad and a couple of\nothers were planning some sort of an observation force of a few men\nfor each place, until the fire had been gotten out or under control.\nGlenn Murell decided he'd go out with me, at least as far as the fire,\nso we went down to the vehicle port and got the jeep out. Main City\nLevel Broadway was almost deserted; everybody had gone down below\nwhere the excitement was. We started down the nearest vehicle shaft\nand immediately got into a jam, above a lot of stuff that was going\ninto the shaft from the First Level Down, mostly manipulators and that\nsort of thing. There were no police around, natch, and a lot of\nvolunteers were trying to direct traffic and getting in each other's\nway. I got some views with the jeep camera, just to remind any of the\npublic who needed reminding what our city administration wasn't doing\nin an emergency. A couple of pieces of apparatus, a chemical tank and\na pumper marked SALAMANDER VOLUNTEER FIRE COMPANY NO. 3 came along,\nveered out of the jam, and continued uptown.\n\n\"If they know another way down, maybe we'd better follow them,\" Murell\nsuggested.\n\n\"They're not going down. They're going to the lumber plant, in case\nthe fire spreads upward,\" I said. \"They wouldn't be taking that sort\nof equipment to a wax fire.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\nI looked at him. \"I thought you were in the wax business,\" I said.\n\n\"I am, but I'm no chemist. I don't know anything about how wax burns.\nAll I know is what it's used for, roughly, and who's in the market for\nit.\"\n\n\"Well, you know about those jumbo molecules, don't you?\" I asked.\n\"They have everything but the kitchen sink in them, including enough\noxygen to sustain combustion even under water or in a vacuum. Not\nenough oxygen to make wax explode, like powder, but enough to keep it\nburning. Chemical extinguishers are all smothering agents, and you\njust can't smother a wax fire. And water's worse than useless.\"\n\nHe wanted to know why.\n\n\"Burning wax is a liquid. The melting point is around 250 degrees\nCentigrade. Wax ignites at 750. It has no boiling point, unless that's\nthe burning point. Throw water on a wax fire and you get a steam\nexplosion, just as you would if you threw it on molten metal, and that\nthrows the fire around and spreads it.\"\n\n\"If it melts that far below the ignition point, wouldn't it run away\nbefore it caught fire?\"\n\n\"Normally, it would. That's why I'm sure this fire was a touch-off. I\nthink somebody planted a thermoconcentrate bomb. A thermoconcentrate\nflame is around 850 Centigrade; the wax would start melting and\nburning almost instantaneously. In any case, the fire will be at the\nbottom of the stacks. If it started there, melted wax would run down\nfrom above and keep the fire going, and if it started at the top,\nburning wax would run down and ignite what's below.\"\n\n\"Well, how in blazes do you put a wax fire out?\" he wanted to know.\n\n\"You don't. You just pull away all the wax that hasn't caught fire\nyet, and then try to scatter the fire and let it burn itself out....\nHere's our chance!\"\n\nAll this conversation we had been screaming into each other's ears, in\nthe midst of a pandemonium of yelling, cursing, siren howling and bell\nclanging; just then I saw a hole in the vertical traffic jam and edged\nthe jeep into it, at the same time remembering that the jeep carried,\nand I was entitled to use, a fire siren. I added its howls to the\ngeneral uproar and dropped down one level. Here a string of big\nmanipulators were trying to get in from below, sprouting claw hooks\nand grapples and pusher arms in all directions. I made my siren\nimitate a tail-tramped tomcat a couple of times, and got in among\nthem.\n\nBottom Level Broadway was a frightful mess, and I realized that we had\ncome down right between two units of the city power plant, big\nmass-energy converters. The street was narrower than above, and ran\nfor a thousand yards between ceiling-high walls, and everything was\nbottlenecked together. I took the jeep up till we were almost scraping\nthe ceiling, and Murell, who had seen how the audiovisual was used,\ntook over with it while I concentrated on inching forward. The noise\nwas even worse down here than it had been above; we didn't attempt to\ntalk.\n\nFinally, by impudence and plain foolhardiness, I got the jeep forward\na few hundred yards, and found myself looking down on a big derrick\nwith a fifty-foot steel boom tipped with a four-clawed grapple,\nshielded in front with sheet steel like a gun shield. It was painted\nwith the emblem of the Hunters' Co-operative, but the three men on it\nlooked like shipyard workers. I didn't get that, at all. The thing had\nbeen built to handle burning wax, and was one of three kept on the\nSecond Level Down under Hunters' Hall. I wondered if Bish Ware had\nfound a way for a gang to get in at the bottom of Hunters' Hall. I\nsimply couldn't see Steve Ravick releasing equipment to fight the fire\nhis goons had started for him in the first place.\n\nI let down a few feet, gave a polite little scream with my siren, and\nthen yelled down to the men on it:\n\n\"Where'd that thing come from?\"\n\n\"Hunters' Hall; Steve Ravick sent it. The other two are up at the fire\nalready, and if this mess ahead doesn't get straightened out....\" From\nthere on, his remarks were not suitable for publication in a family\njournal like the _Times_.\n\nI looked up ahead, rising to the ceiling again, and saw what was the\nmatter. It was one of the dredgers from the waterfront, really a\nsubmarine scoop shovel, that they used to keep the pools and the inner\nchannel from sanding up. I wasn't surprised it was jammed; I couldn't\nsee how they'd gotten this far uptown with it. I got a few shots of\nthat, and then unhooked the handphone of my radio. Julio Kubanoff\nanswered.\n\n\"You getting everything I'm sending in?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes. What's that two-em-dashed thing up ahead, one of the harbor\ndredgers?\"\n\n\"That's right. Hey, look at this, once.\" I turned the audiovisual down\non the claw derrick. \"The men on it look like Rodriguez &\nOughourlian's people, but they say Steve Ravick sent it. What do you\nknow about it?\"\n\n\"Hey, Ralph! What's this Walt's picked up about Ravick sending\nequipment to fight the fire?\" he yelled.\n\nDad came over, and nodded. \"It wasn't Ravick, it was Mort Hallstock.\nHe commandeered the Co-op equipment and sent it up,\" he said. \"He\ncalled me and wanted to know whom to send for it that Ravick's gang\nwouldn't start shooting at right away. Casmir Oughourlian sent some of\nhis men.\"\n\nUp front, something seemed to have given way. The dredger went\nlurching forward, and everything moved off after it.\n\n\"I get it,\" I said. \"Hallstock's getting ready to dump Ravick out the\nairlock. He sees, now, that Ravick's a dead turkey; he doesn't want to\ngo into the oven along with him.\"\n\n\"Walt, can't you ever give anybody credit with trying to do something\ndecent, once in a while?\" Dad asked.\n\n\"Sure I can. Decent people. There are a lot of them around, but Mort\nHallstock isn't one of them. There was an Old Terran politician named\nAl Smith, once. He had a little saying he used in that kind of case:\n'Let's look at the record.'\"\n\n\"Well, Mort's record isn't very impressive, I'll give you that,\" Dad\nadmitted. \"I understand Mort's up at the fire now. Don't spit in his\neye if you run into him.\"\n\n\"I won't,\" I promised. \"I'm kind of particular where I spit.\"\n\nThings must be looking pretty rough around Municipal Building, I\nthought. Maybe Mort's afraid the people will start running Fenris\nagain, after this. He might even be afraid there'd be an election.\n\nBy this time, I'd gotten the jeep around the dredger--we'd come to the\nend of the nuclear-power plant buildings--and cut off into open\ncountry. That is to say, nothing but pillar-buildings two hundred\nyards apart and piles of bagged mineral nutrients for the hydroponic\nfarms. We could see a blaze of electric lights ahead where the fire\nmust be, and after a while we began to run into lorries and\nlifter-skids hauling ammunition away from the area. Then I could see a\nbig mushroom of greasy black smoke spreading out close to the ceiling.\nThe electric lights were brighter ahead, and there was a confused roar\nof voices and sirens and machines.\n\nAnd there was a stink.\n\nThere are a lot of stinks around Port Sandor, though the ventilation\nsystem carries most of them off before they can spread out of their\nown areas. The plant that reprocesses sewage to get organic nutrients\nfor the hydroponic farms, and the plant that digests hydroponic\nvegetation to make nutrients for the carniculture vats. The\ncarniculture vats themselves aren't any flower gardens. And the pulp\nplant where our synthetic lumber is made. But the worst stink there is\non Fenris is a tallow-wax fire. Fortunately, they don't happen often.\n\n\n\n\n17\n\nTALLOW-WAX FIRE\n\n\nNow that we were out of the traffic jam, I could poke along and use\nthe camera myself. The wax was stacked in piles twenty feet high,\nwhich gave thirty feet of clear space above them, but the section\nwhere they had been piled was badly cut up by walls and full of small\nextra columns to support the weight of the pulp plant above and the\ncarniculture vats on the level over that. However, the piles\nthemselves weren't separated by any walls, and the fire could spread\nto the whole stock of wax. There were more men and vehicles on the job\nthan room for them to work. I passed over the heads of the crowd\naround the edges and got onto a comparatively unobstructed side where\nI could watch and get views of the fire fighters pulling down the big\nskins of wax and loading them onto contragravity skids to be hauled\naway. It still wasn't too hot to work unshielded, and they weren't\nanywhere near the burning stacks, but the fire seemed to be spreading\nrapidly. The dredger and the three shielded derricks hadn't gotten\ninto action yet.\n\nI circled around clockwise, dodging over, under and around the skids\nand lorries hauling wax out of danger. They were taking them into the\nsection through which I had brought the jeep a few minutes before, and\njust dumping them on top of the piles of mineral nutrients.\n\nThe operation seemed to be directed from an improvised headquarters in\nthe area that had been cleared of ammunition. There were a couple of\nview screens and a radio, operated by women. I saw one of the teachers\nI'd gone to school to a few years ago, and Joe Kivelson's wife, and\nOscar Fujisawa's current girl friend, and Sigurd Ngozori's secretary,\nand farther off there was an equally improvised coffee-and-sandwich\nstand. I grounded the jeep, and Murell and I got out and went over to\nthe headquarters. Joe Kivelson seemed to be in charge.\n\nI have, I believe, indicated here and there that Joe isn't one of our\nmightier intellects. There are a lot of better heads, but Joe can be\nrelied upon to keep his, no matter what is happening or how bad it\ngets. He was sitting on an empty box, his arm in a now-filthy sling,\nand one of Mohandas Feinberg's crooked black cigars in his mouth.\nUsually, Joe smokes a pipe, but a cigar's less bother for a\ntemporarily one-armed man. Standing in front of him, like a schoolboy\nin front of the teacher, was Mayor Morton Hallstock.\n\n\"But, Joe, they simply won't!\" His Honor was wailing. \"I did talk to\nMr. Fieschi; he says he knows this is an emergency, but there's a\nstrict company directive against using the spaceport area for storage\nof anything but cargo that has either just come in or is being shipped\nout on the next ship.\"\n\n\"What's this all about?\" Murell asked.\n\n\"Fieschi, at the spaceport, won't let us store this wax in the\nspaceport area,\" Joe said. \"We got to get it stored somewhere; we need\na lot of floor space to spread this fire out on, once we get into it.\nWe have to knock the burning wax cylinders apart, and get them\nseparated enough so that burning wax won't run from one to another.\"\n\n\"Well, why can't we store it in the spaceport area?\" Murell wanted to\nknow. \"It is going out on the next ship. I'm consigning it to Exotic\nOrganics, in Buenos Aires.\" He turned to Joe. \"Are those skins all\nmarked to indicate who owns them?\"\n\n\"That's right. And any we gather up loose, from busted skins, we can\nfigure some way of settling how much anybody's entitled to from them.\"\n\n\"All right. Get me a car and run me to the spaceport. Call them and\ntell them I'm on the way. I'll talk to Fieschi myself.\"\n\n\"Martha!\" Joe yelled to his wife. \"Car and driver, quick. And then\ncall the spaceport for me; get Mr. Fieschi or Mr. Mansour on screen.\"\n\nInside two minutes, a car came in and picked Murell up. By that time,\nJoe was talking to somebody at the spaceport. I called the paper, and\ntold Dad that Murell was buying the wax for his company as fast as it\nwas being pulled off the fire, at eighty centisols a pound. He said\nthat would go out as a special bulletin right away. Then I talked to\nMorton Hallstock, and this time he wasn't giving me any of the\nrun-along-sonny routine. I told him, rather hypocritically, what a\nfine thing he'd done, getting that equipment from Hunters' Hall. I\nsuspect I sounded as though I were mayor of Port Sandor and Hallstock,\njust seventeen years old, had done something the grownups thought was\nreal smart for a kid. If so, he didn't seem to notice. Somebody\nconnected with the press was being nice to him. I asked him where\nSteve Ravick was.\n\n\"Mr. Ravick is at Hunters' Hall,\" he said. \"He thought it would be\nunwise to make a public appearance just now.\" Oh, brother, what an\nunderstatement! \"There seems to be a lot of public feeling against\nhim, due to some misconception that he was responsible for what\nhappened to Captain Kivelson's ship. Of course, that is absolutely\nfalse. Mr. Ravick had absolutely nothing to do with that. He wasn't\nanywhere near the _Javelin_.\"\n\n\"Where's Al Devis?\" I asked.\n\n\"Who? I don't believe I know him.\"\n\nAfter Hallstock got into his big black air-limousine and took off, Joe\nKivelson gave a short laugh.\n\n\"I could have told him where Al Devis is,\" he said. \"No, I couldn't,\neither,\" he corrected himself. \"That's a religious question, and I\ndon't discuss religion.\"\n\nI shut off my radio in a hurry. \"Who got him?\" I asked.\n\nJoe named a couple of men from one of the hunter-ships.\n\n\"Here's what happened. There were six men on guard here; they had a\njeep with a 7-mm machine gun. About an hour ago, a lorry pulled in,\nwith two men in boat-clothes on it. They said that Pierre Karolyi's\n_Corinne_ had just come in with a hold full of wax, and they were\nbringing it up from the docks, and where should they put it? Well, the\nmen on guard believed that; Pierre'd gone off into the twilight zone\nafter the _Helldiver_ contacted us, and he could have gotten a monster\nin the meantime.\n\n\"Well, they told these fellows that there was more room over on the\nother side of the stacks, and the lorry went up above the stacks and\nstarted across, and when they were about the middle, one of the men in\nit threw out a thermoconcentrate bomb. The lorry took off, right away.\nThe only thing was that there were two men in the jeep, and one of\nthem was at the machine gun. They'd lifted to follow the lorry over\nand show them where to put this wax, and as soon as the bomb went off,\nthe man at the gun grabbed it and caught the lorry in his sights and\nlet go. This fellow hadn't been covering for cutting-up work for years\nfor nothing. He got one burst right in the control cabin, and the\nlorry slammed into the next column foundation. After they called in an\nalarm on the fire the bomb had started, a couple of them went to see\nwho'd been in the lorry. The two men in it were both dead, and one of\nthem was Al Devis.\"\n\n\"Pity,\" I said. \"I'd been looking forward to putting a recording of\nhis confession on the air. Where is this lorry now?\"\n\nJoe pointed toward the burning wax piles. \"Almost directly on the\nother side. We have a couple of men guarding it. The bodies are still\nin it. We don't want any tampering with it till it can be properly\nexamined; we want to have the facts straight, in case Hallstock tries\nto make trouble for the men who did the shooting.\"\n\nI didn't know how he could. Under any kind of Federation law at all, a\nman killed committing a felony--and bombing and arson ought to\nqualify for that--is simply bought and paid for; his blood is on\nnobody's head but his own. Of course, a small matter like legality was\nalways the least of Mort Hallstock's worries.\n\n\"I'll go get some shots of it,\" I said, and then I snapped on my radio\nand called the story in.\n\nDad had already gotten it, from fire-alarm center, but he hadn't heard\nthat Devis was one of the deceased arsonists. Like me, he was very\nsorry to hear about it. Devis as Devis was no loss, but alive and\ntalking he'd have helped us pin both the wax fire and the bombing of\nthe _Javelin_ on Steve Ravick. Then I went back and got in the jeep.\n\nThey were beginning to get in closer to the middle of the stacks where\nthe fire had been started. There was no chance of getting over the top\nof it, and on the right there were at least five hundred men and a\nhundred vehicles, all working like crazy to pull out unburned wax. Big\nmanipulators were coming up and grabbing as many of the half-ton\nsausages as they could, and lurching away to dump them onto skids or\ninto lorries or just drop them on top of the bags of nutrient stacked\nbeyond. Jeeps and cars would dart in, throw grapnels on the end of\nlines, and then pull away all the wax they could and return to throw\ntheir grapnels again. As fast as they pulled the big skins down, men\nwith hand-lifters like the ones we had used at our camp to handle\nfirewood would pick them up and float them away.\n\nThat seemed to be where the major effort was being made, at present,\nand I could see lifter-skids coming in with big blower fans on them. I\nknew what the strategy was, now; they were going to pull the wax away\nto where it was burning on one side, and then set up the blowers and\nblow the heat and smoke away on that side. That way, on the other side\nmore men could work closer to the fire, and in the long run they'd\nsave more wax.\n\nI started around the wax piles to the left, clockwise, to avoid the\nactivity on the other side, and before long I realized that I'd have\ndone better not to have. There was a long wall, ceiling-high, that\nstretched off uptown in the direction of the spaceport, part of the\nsupport for the weight of the pulpwood plant on the level above, and\npiled against it was a lot of junk machinery of different kinds that\nhad been hauled in here and dumped long ago and then forgotten. The\nwax was piled almost against this, and the heat and smoke forced me\ndown.\n\nI looked at the junk pile and decided that I could get through it on\nfoot. I had been keeping up a running narration into my radio, and I\ncommented on all this salvageable metal lying in here forgotten, with\nour perennial metal shortages. Then I started picking my way through\nit, my portable audiovisual camera slung over my shoulder and a\nflashlight in my hand. My left hand, of course; it's never smart to\ncarry a light in your right, unless you're left-handed.\n\nThe going wasn't too bad. Most of the time, I could get between things\nwithout climbing over them. I was going between a broken-down press\nfrom the lumber plant and a leaky 500-gallon pressure cooker from the\ncarniculture nutrient plant when I heard something moving behind me,\nand I was suddenly very glad that I hadn't let myself be talked into\nleaving my pistol behind.\n\nIt was a thing the size of a ten-gallon keg, with a thick tail and\nflippers on which it crawled, and six tentacles like small elephants'\ntrunks around a circular mouth filled with jagged teeth halfway down\nthe throat. There are a dozen or so names for it, but mostly it is\ncalled a meat-grinder.\n\nThe things are always hungry and try to eat anything that moves. The\nmere fact that I would be as poisonous to it as any of the local flora\nor fauna would be to me made no difference; this meat-grinder was no\nbiochemist. It was coming straight for me, all its tentacles writhing.\n\nI had had my Sterberg out as soon as I'd heard the noise. I also\nremembered that my radio was on, and that I was supposed to comment on\nanything of interest that took place around me.\n\n\"Here's a meat-grinder, coming right for me,\" I commented in a voice\nnot altogether steady, and slammed three shots down its tooth-studded\ngullet. Then I scored my target, at the same time keeping out of the\nway of the tentacles. He began twitching a little. I fired again. The\nmeat-grinder jerked slightly, and that was all.\n\n\"Now I'm going out and take a look at that lorry.\" I was certain now\nthat the voice was shaky.\n\nThe lorry--and Al Devis and his companion--had come to an end against\none of the two-hundred-foot masonry and concrete foundations the\ncolumns rest on. It had hit about halfway up and folded almost like an\naccordion, sliding down to the floor. With one thing and another,\nthere is a lot of violent death around Port Sandor. I don't like to\nlook at the results. It's part of the job, however, and this time it\nwasn't a pleasant job at all.\n\nThe two men who were guarding the wreck and contents were sitting on\na couple of boxes, smoking and watching the fire-fighting operation.\n\nI took the partly empty clip out of my pistol and put in a full one on\nthe way back, and kept my flashlight moving its circle of light ahead\nand on both sides of me. That was foolish, or at least unnecessary. If\nthere'd been one meat-grinder in that junk pile, it was a safe bet\nthere wasn't anything else. Meat-grinders aren't popular neighbors,\neven for tread-snails. As I approached the carcass of the grinder I\nhad shot I found a ten-foot length of steel rod and poked it a few\ntimes. When it didn't even twitch, I felt safe in walking past it.\n\nI got back in the jeep and returned to where Joe Kivelson was keeping\ntrack of what was going on in five screens, including one from a\npickup on a lifter at the ceiling, and shouting orders that were being\nreshouted out of loudspeakers all over the place. The Odin Dock &\nShipyard equipment had begun coming out; lorries picking up the wax\nthat had been dumped back from the fire and wax that was being pulled\noff the piles, and material-handling equipment. They had a lot of\nsmall fork-lifters that were helping close to the fire.\n\nA lot of the wax was getting so soft that it was hard to handle, and\nquite a few of the plastic skins had begun to split from the heat.\nHere and there I saw that outside piles had begun to burn at the\nbottom, from burning wax that had run out underneath. I had moved\naround to the right and was getting views of the big claw-derricks at\nwork picking the big sausages off the tops of piles, and while I was\nswinging the camera back and forth, I was trying to figure just how\nmuch wax there had been to start with, and how much was being saved.\nEach of those plastic-covered cylinders was a thousand pounds; one of\nthe claw-derricks was picking up two or three of them at a grab....\n\nI was still figuring when shouts of alarm on my right drew my head\naround. There was an uprush of flame, and somebody began screaming,\nand I could see an ambulance moving toward the center of excitement\nand firemen in asbestos suits converging on a run. One of the piles\nmust have collapsed and somebody must have been splashed. I gave an\ninvoluntary shudder. Burning wax was hotter than melted lead, and it\nstuck to anything it touched, worse than napalm. I saw a man being\ndragged out of further danger, his clothes on fire, and\nasbestos-suited firemen crowding around to tear the burning garments\nfrom him. Before I could get to where it had happened, though, they\nhad him in the ambulance and were taking him away. I hoped they'd get\nhim to the hospital before he died.\n\nThen more shouting started around at the right as a couple more piles\nbegan collapsing. I was able to get all of that--the wax sausages\nsliding forward, the men who had been working on foot running out of\ndanger, the flames shooting up, and the gush of liquid fire from\nbelow. All three derricks moved in at once and began grabbing wax\ncylinders away on either side of it.\n\nThen I saw Guido Fieschi, the Odin Dock & Shipyard's superintendent,\nand caught him in my camera, moving the jeep toward him.\n\n\"Mr. Fieschi!\" I called. \"Give me a few seconds and say something.\"\n\nHe saw me and grinned.\n\n\"I just came out to see how much more could be saved,\" he said. \"We\nhave close to a thousand tons on the shipping floor or out of danger\nhere and on the way in, and it looks as though you'll be able to save\nthat much more. That'll be a million and a half sols we can be sure\nof, and a possible three million, at the new price. And I want to take\nthis occasion, on behalf of my company and of Terra-Odin Spacelines,\nto welcome a new freight shipper.\"\n\n\"Well, that's wonderful news for everybody on Fenris,\" I said, and\nadded mentally, \"with a few exceptions.\" Then I asked if he'd heard\nwho had gotten splashed.\n\n\"No. I know it happened; I passed the ambulance on the way out. I\ncertainly hope they get to work on him in time.\"\n\nThen more wax started sliding off the piles, and more fire came\nrunning out at the bottom. Joe Kivelson's voice, out of the\nloudspeakers all around, was yelling:\n\n\"Everybody away from the front! Get the blowers in; start in on the\nother side!\"\n\n\n\n\n18\n\nTHE TREASON OF BISH WARE\n\n\nI wanted to find out who had been splashed, but Joe Kivelson was too\nbusy directing the new phase of the fight to hand out casualty reports\nto the press, and besides, there were too many things happening all at\nonce that I had to get. I went around to the other side where the\nincendiaries had met their end, moving slowly as close to the face of\nthe fire as I could get and shooting the burning wax flowing out from\nit. A lot of equipment, including two of the three claw-derricks and a\ndredger--they'd brought a second one up from the waterfront--were\nmoving to that side. By the time I had gotten around, the blowers had\nbeen maneuvered into place and were ready to start. There was a lot of\nback-and-forth yelling to make sure that everybody was out from in\nfront, and then the blowers started.\n\nIt looked like a horizontal volcanic eruption; burning wax blowing\naway from the fire for close to a hundred feet into the clear space\nbeyond. The derricks and manipulators and the cars and jeeps with\ngrapnels went in on both sides, snatching and dragging wax away.\nBecause they had the wind from the blowers behind them, the men could\nwork a lot closer, and the fire wasn't spreading as rapidly. They were\nsaving a lot of wax; each one of those big sausages that the lifters\npicked up and floated away weighed a thousand pounds, and was worth,\nat the new price, eight hundred sols.\n\nFinally, they got everything away that they could, and then the\nblowers were shut down and the two dredge shovels moved in, scooping\nup the burning sludge and carrying it away, scattering it on the\nconcrete. I would have judged that there had been six or seven million\nsols' worth of wax in the piles to start with, and that a little more\nthan half of it had been saved before they pulled the last cylinder\naway.\n\nThe work slacked off; finally, there was nothing but the two dredges\ndoing anything, and then they backed away and let down, and it was all\nover but standing around and watching the scattered fire burn itself\nout. I looked at my watch. It was two hours since the first alarm had\ncome in. I took a last swing around, got the spaceport people\ngathering up wax and hauling it away, and the broken lake of fire that\nextended downtown from where the stacks had been, and then I floated\nmy jeep over to the sandwich-and-coffee stand and let down, getting\nout. Maybe, I thought, I could make some kind of deal with somebody\nlike Interworld News on this. It would make a nice thrilling\nfeature-program item. Just a little slice of life from Fenris, the\nGarden Spot of the Galaxy.\n\nI got myself a big zhoumy-loin sandwich with hot sauce and a cup of\ncoffee, made sure that my portable radio was on, and circulated among\nthe fire fighters, getting comments. Everybody had been a hero,\nnatch, and they were all very unbashful about admitting it. There was\na great deal of wisecracking about Al Devis buying himself a ringside\nseat for the fire he'd started. Then I saw Ces\u00e1rio Vieira and joined\nhim.\n\n\"Have all the fire you want, for a while?\" I asked him.\n\n\"Brother, and how! We could have used a little of this over on Hermann\nReuch's Land, though. Have you seen Tom around anywhere?\"\n\n\"No. Have you?\"\n\n\"I saw him over there, about an hour ago. I guess he stayed on this\nside. After they started blowing it, I was over on Al Devis's side.\"\nHe whistled softly. \"Was that a mess!\"\n\nThere was still a crowd at the fire, but they seemed all to be\ntownspeople. The hunters had gathered where Joe Kivelson had been\ndirecting operations. We finished our sandwiches and went over to join\nthem. As soon as we got within earshot, I found that they were all in\na very ugly mood.\n\n\"Don't fool around,\" one man was saying as we came up. \"Don't even\nbother looking for a rope. Just shoot them as soon as you see them.\"\n\nWell, I thought, a couple of million sols' worth of tallow-wax, in\nwhich they all owned shares, was something to get mean about. I said\nsomething like that.\n\n\"It's not that,\" another man said. \"It's Tom Kivelson.\"\n\n\"What about him?\" I asked, alarmed.\n\n\"Didn't you hear? He got splashed with burning wax,\" the hunter said.\n\"His whole back was on fire; I don't know whether he's alive now or\nnot.\"\n\nSo that was who I'd seen screaming in agony while the firemen tore his\nburning clothes away. I pushed through, with Ces\u00e1rio behind me, and\nfound Joe Kivelson and Mohandas Feinberg and Corkscrew Finnegan and\nOscar Fujisawa and a dozen other captains and ships' officers in a\nhuddle.\n\n\"Joe,\" I said, \"I just heard about Tom. Do you know anything yet?\"\n\nJoe turned. \"Oh, Walt. Why, as far as we know, he's alive. He was\nalive when they got him to the hospital.\"\n\n\"That's at the spaceport?\" I unhooked my handphone and got Dad. He'd\nheard about a man being splashed, but didn't know who it was. He said\nhe'd call the hospital at once. A few minutes later, he was calling me\nback.\n\n\"He's been badly burned, all over the back. They're preparing to do a\ndeep graft on him. They said his condition was serious, but he was\nalive five minutes ago.\"\n\nI thanked him and hung up, relaying the information to the others.\nThey all looked worried. When the screen girl at a hospital tells you\nsomebody's serious, instead of giving you the well-as-can-be-expected\nroutine, you know it is serious. Anybody who makes it alive to a\nhospital, these days, has an excellent chance, but injury cases do\ndie, now and then, after they've been brought in. They are the\n\"serious\" cases.\n\n\"Well, I don't suppose there's anything we can do,\" Joe said heavily.\n\n\"We can clean up on the gang that started this fire,\" Oscar Fujisawa\nsaid. \"Do it now; then if Tom doesn't make it, he's paid for in\nadvance.\"\n\nOscar, I recalled, was the one who had been the most impressed with\nBish Ware's argument that lynching Steve Ravick would cost the hunters\nthe four million sols they might otherwise be able to recover, after a\nfew years' interstellar litigation, from his bank account on Terra.\nThat reminded me that I hadn't even thought of Bish since I'd left the\n_Times_. I called back. Dad hadn't heard a word from him.\n\n\"What's the situation at Hunters' Hall?\" I asked.\n\n\"Everything's quiet there. The police left when Hallstock commandeered\nthat fire-fighting equipment. They helped the shipyard men get it out,\nand then they all went to the Municipal Building. As far as I know,\nboth Ravick and Belsher are still in Hunters' Hall. I'm in contact\nwith the vehicles on guard at the approaches; I'll call them now.\"\n\nI relayed that. The others nodded.\n\n\"Nip Spazoni and a few others are bringing men and guns up from the\ndocks and putting a cordon around the place on the Main City Level,\"\nOscar said. \"Your father will probably be hearing that they're moving\ninto position now.\"\n\nHe had. He also said that he had called all the vehicles on the First\nand Second Levels Down; they all reported no activity in Hunters' Hall\nexcept one jeep on Second Level Down, which did not report at all.\n\nEverybody was puzzled about that.\n\n\"That's the jeep that reported Bish Ware going in on the bottom,\"\nMohandas Feinberg said. \"I wonder if somebody inside mightn't have\ngotten both the man on the jeep and Bish.\"\n\n\"He could have left the jeep,\" Joe said. \"Maybe he went inside after\nBish.\"\n\n\"Funny he didn't call in and say so,\" somebody said.\n\n\"No, it isn't,\" I contradicted. \"Manufacturers' claims to the\ncontrary, there is no such thing as a tap-proof radio. Maybe he wasn't\nsupposed to leave his post, but if he did, he used his head not\nadvertising it.\"\n\n\"That makes sense,\" Oscar agreed. \"Well, whatever happened, we're not\ndoing anything standing around up here. Let's get it started.\"\n\nHe walked away, raising his voice and calling, \"_Pequod_! _Pequod_!\nAll hands on deck!\"\n\nThe others broke away from the group, shouting the names of their\nships to rally their crews. I hurried over to the jeep and checked my\nequipment. There wasn't too much film left in the big audiovisual, so\nI replaced it with a fresh sound-and-vision reel, good for another\ncouple of hours, and then lifted to the ceiling. Worrying about Tom\nwouldn't help Tom, and worrying about Bish wouldn't help Bish, and I\nhad a job to do.\n\nWhat I was getting now, and I was glad I was starting a fresh reel for\nit, was the beginning of the First Fenris Civil War. A long time from\nnow, when Fenris was an important planet in the Federation, maybe\nthey'd make today a holiday, like Bastille Day or the Fourth of July\nor Federation Day. Maybe historians, a couple of centuries from now,\nwould call me an important primary source, and if Ces\u00e1rio's religion\nwas right, maybe I'd be one of them, saying, \"Well, after all, is\nBoyd such a reliable source? He was only seventeen years old at the\ntime.\"\n\nFinally, after a lot of yelling and confusion, the Rebel Army got\nmoving. We all went up to Main City Level and went down Broadway,\nspreading out side streets when we began running into the cordon that\nhad been thrown around Hunters' Hall. They were mostly men from the\nwaterfront who hadn't gotten to the wax fire, and they must have\nstripped the guns off half the ships in the harbor and mounted them on\nlorries or cargo skids.\n\nNobody, not even Joe Kivelson, wanted to begin with any massed frontal\nattack on Hunters' Hall.\n\n\"We'll have to bombard the place,\" he was saying. \"We try to rush it\nand we'll lose half our gang before we get in. One man with good cover\nand a machine gun's good for a couple of hundred in the open.\"\n\n\"Bish may be inside,\" I mentioned.\n\n\"Yes,\" Oscar said, \"and even aside from that, that building was built\nwith our money. Let's don't burn the house down to get rid of the\ncockroaches.\"\n\n\"Well, how are you going to do it, then?\" Joe wanted to know. Rule out\nfrontal attack and Joe's at the end of his tactics.\n\n\"You stay up here. Keep them amused with a little smallarms fire at\nthe windows and so on. I'll take about a dozen men and go down to\nSecond Level. If we can't do anything else, we can bring a couple of\nskins of tallow-wax down and set fire to it and smoke them out.\"\n\nThat sounded like a pretty expensive sort of smudge, but seeing how\nmuch wax Ravick had burned uptown, it was only fair to let him in on\nsome of the smoke. I mentioned that if we got into the building and up\nto Main City Level, we'd need some way of signaling to avoid being\nshot by our own gang, and got the wave-length combination of the\nPequod scout boat, which Joe and Oscar were using for a command car.\nOscar picked ten or twelve men, and they got into a lorry and went\nuptown and down a vehicle shaft to Second Level. I followed in my\njeep, even after Oscar and his crowd let down and got out, and hovered\nbehind them as they advanced on foot to Hunters' Hall.\n\nThe Second Level Down was the vehicle storage, where the derricks and\nother equipment had been kept. It was empty now except for a\nworkbench, a hand forge and some other things like that, a few drums\nof lubricant, and several piles of sheet metal. Oscar and his men got\ninside and I followed, going up to the ceiling. I was the one who saw\nthe man lying back of a pile of sheet metal, and called their\nattention.\n\nHe wore boat-clothes and had black whiskers, and he had a knife and a\npistol on his belt. At first I thought he was dead. A couple of\nOscar's followers, dragging him out, said:\n\n\"He's been sleep-gassed.\"\n\nSomebody else recognized him. He was the lone man who had been on\nguard in the jeep. The jeep was nowhere in sight.\n\nI began to be really worried. My lighter gadget could have been what\nhad gassed him. It probably was; there weren't many sleep-gas weapons\non Fenris. I had to get fills made up specially for mine. So it looked\nto me as though somebody had gotten mine off Bish, and then used it\nto knock out our guard. Taken it off his body I guessed. That crowd\nwasn't any more interested in taking prisoners alive than we were.\n\nWe laid the man on a workbench and put a rolled-up sack under his head\nfor a pillow. Then we started up the enclosed stairway. I didn't think\nwe were going to run into any trouble, though I kept my hand close to\nmy gun. If they'd knocked out the guard, they had a way out, and none\nof them wanted to stay in that building any longer than they had to.\n\nThe First Level Down was mostly storerooms, with nobody in any of\nthem. As we went up the stairway to the Main City Level, we could hear\nfiring outside. Nobody inside was shooting back. I unhooked my\nhandphone.\n\n\"We're in,\" I said when Joe Kivelson answered. \"Stop the shooting;\nwe're coming up to the vehicle port.\"\n\n\"Might as well. Nobody's paying any attention to it,\" he said.\n\nThe firing slacked off as the word was passed around the perimeter,\nand finally it stopped entirely. We went up into the open arched\nvehicle port. It was barricaded all around, and there were half a\ndozen machine guns set up, but not a living thing.\n\n\"We're going up,\" I said. \"They've all lammed out. The place is\nempty.\"\n\n\"You don't know that,\" Oscar chided. \"It might be bulging with\nRavick's thugs, waiting for us to come walking up and be mowed down.\"\n\nPossible. Highly improbable, though, I thought. The escalators weren't\nrunning, and we weren't going to alert any hypothetical ambush by\nstarting them. We tiptoed up, and I even drew my pistol to show that I\nwasn't being foolhardy. The big social room was empty. A couple of us\nwent over and looked behind the bar, which was the only hiding place\nin it. Then we went back to the rear and tiptoed to the third floor.\n\nThe meeting room was empty. So were the offices behind it. I looked in\nall of them, expecting to find Bish Ware's body. Maybe a couple of\nother bodies, too. I'd seen him shoot the tread-snail, and I didn't\nthink he'd die unpaid for. In Steve Ravick's office, the safe was open\nand a lot of papers had been thrown out. I pointed that out to Oscar,\nand he nodded. After seeing that, he seemed to relax, as though he\nwasn't expecting to find anybody any more. We went to the third floor.\nRavick's living quarters were there, and they were magnificently\nluxurious. The hunters, whose money had paid for all that magnificence\nand luxury, cursed.\n\nThere were no bodies there, either, or on the landing stage above. I\nunhooked the radio again.\n\n\"You can come in, now,\" I said. \"The place is empty. Nobody here but\nus Vigilantes.\"\n\n\"Huh?\" Joe couldn't believe that. \"How'd they get out?\"\n\n\"They got out on the Second Level Down.\" I told him about the\nsleep-gassed guard.\n\n\"Did you bring him to? What did he say?\"\n\n\"Nothing; we didn't. We can't. You get sleep-gassed, you sleep till\nyou wake up. That ought to be two to four hours for this fellow.\"\n\n\"Well, hold everything; we're coming in.\"\n\nWe were all in the social room; a couple of the men had poured drinks\nor drawn themselves beers at the bar and rung up no sale on the cash\nregister. Somebody else had a box of cigars he'd picked up in Ravick's\nquarters on the fourth floor and was passing them around. Joe and\nabout two or three hundred other hunters came crowding up the\nescalator, which they had turned on below.\n\n\"You didn't find Bish Ware, either, I'll bet,\" Joe was saying.\n\n\"I'm afraid they took him along for a hostage,\" Oscar said. \"The guard\nwas knocked out with Walt's gas gadget, that Bish was carrying.\"\n\n\"Ha!\" Joe cried. \"Bet you it was the other way round; Bish took them\nout.\"\n\nThat started an argument. While it was going on, I went to the\ncommunication screen and got the _Times_, and told Dad what had\nhappened.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"That was what I was afraid you'd find. Glenn Murell\ncalled in from the spaceport a few minutes ago. He says Mort Hallstock\ncame in with his car, and he heard from some of the workmen that Bish\nWare, Steve Ravick and Leo Belsher came in on the Main City Level in a\njeep. They claimed protection from a mob, and Captain Courtland's\npolice are protecting them.\"\n\n\n\n\n19\n\nMASKS OFF\n\n\nThere was dead silence for two or three seconds. If a kitten had\nsneezed, everybody would have heard it. Then it started, first an\ninarticulate roar, and then a babel of unprintabilities. I thought I'd\nheard some bad language from these same men in this room when Leo\nBelsher's announcement of the price cut had been telecast, but that\nwas prayer meeting to this. Dad was still talking. At least, I saw his\nlips move in the screen.\n\n\"Say that again, Ralph,\" Oscar Fujisawa shouted.\n\nDad must have heard him. At least, his lips moved again, but I wasn't\na lip reader and neither was Oscar. Oscar turned to the mob--by now,\nit was that, pure and simple--and roared, in a voice like a foghorn,\n\"_Shut up and listen!_\" A few of those closest to him heard him. The\nrest kept on shouting curses. Oscar waited a second, and then pointed\nhis submachine gun at the ceiling and hammered off the whole clip.\n\n\"Shut up, a couple of hundred of you, and listen!\" he commanded, on\nthe heels of the blast. Then he turned to the screen again. \"Now,\nRalph; what was it you were saying?\"\n\n\"Hallstock got to the spaceport about half an hour ago,\" Dad said. \"He\nbought a ticket to Terra. Sigurd Ngozori's here; he called the bank\nand one of the clerks there told him that Hallstock had checked out\nhis whole account, around three hundred thousand sols. Took some of it\nin cash and the rest in Banking Cartel drafts. Murell says that his\ninformation is that Bish Ware, Steve Ravick and Leo Belsher arrived\nearlier, about an hour ago. He didn't see them himself, but he talked\nwith spaceport workmen who did.\"\n\nThe men who had crowded up to the screen seemed to have run out of\noaths and obscenities now. Oscar was fitting another clip into his\nsubmachine gun.\n\n\"Well, we'll have to go to the spaceport and get them,\" he said. \"And\ntake four ropes instead of three.\"\n\n\"You'll have to fight your way in,\" Dad told him. \"Odin Dock &\nShipyard won't let you take people out of their spaceport without a\nfight. They've all bought tickets by now, and Fieschi will have to\nprotect them.\"\n\n\"Then we'll kick the blankety-blank spaceport apart,\" somebody\nshouted.\n\nThat started it up again. Oscar wondered if getting silence was worth\nanother clip of cartridges, and decided it wasn't. He managed to make\nhimself heard without it.\n\n\"We'll do nothing of the kind. We need that spaceport to stay alive.\nBut we will take Ravick and Belsher and Hallstock--\"\n\n\"And that etaoin shrdlu traitor of a Ware!\" Joe Kivelson added.\n\n\"And Bish Ware,\" Oscar agreed. \"They only have fifty police; we have\nthree or four thousand men.\"\n\nThree or four thousand undisciplined hunters, against fifty trained,\ndisciplined and organized soldiers, because that was what the\nspaceport police were. I knew their captain, and the lieutenants. They\nwere old Regular Army, and they ran the police force like a military\nunit.\n\n\"I'll bet Ware was working for Ravick all along,\" Joe was saying.\n\nThat wasn't good thinking even for Joe Kivelson. I said:\n\n\"If he was working for Ravick all along, why did he tip Dad and Oscar\nand the Mahatma on the bomb aboard the _Javelin_? That wasn't any help\nto Ravick.\"\n\n\"I get it,\" Oscar said. \"He never was working for anybody but Bish\nWare. When Ravick got into a jam, he saw a way to make something for\nhimself by getting Ravick out of it. I'll bet, ever since he came\nhere, he was planning to cut in on Ravick somehow. You notice, he knew\njust how much money Ravick had stashed away on Terra? When he saw the\nspot Ravick was in, Bish just thought he had a chance to develop\nhimself another rich uncle.\"\n\nI'd been worse stunned than anybody by Dad's news. The worst of it was\nthat Oscar could be right. I hadn't thought of that before. I'd just\nthought that Ravick and Belsher had gotten Bish drunk and found out\nabout the way the men were posted around Hunters' Hall and the lone\nman in the jeep on Second Level Down.\n\nThen it occurred to me that Bish might have seen a way of getting\nFenris rid of Ravick and at the same time save everybody the guilt of\nlynching him. Maybe he'd turned traitor to save the rest of us from\nourselves.\n\nI turned to Oscar. \"Why get excited about it?\" I asked. \"You have what\nyou wanted. You said yourself that you couldn't care less whether\nRavick got away or not, as long as you got him out of the Co-op. Well,\nhe's out for good now.\"\n\n\"That was before the fire,\" Oscar said. \"We didn't have a couple of\nmillion sols' worth of wax burned. And Tom Kivelson wasn't in the\nhospital with half the skin burned off his back, and a coin toss\nwhether he lives or not.\"\n\n\"Yes. I thought you were Tom's friend,\" Joe Kivelson reproached me.\n\nI wondered how much skin hanging Steve Ravick would grow on Tom's\nback. I didn't see much percentage in asking him, though. I did turn\nto Oscar Fujisawa with a quotation I remembered from _Moby Dick_, the\nbook he'd named his ship from.\n\n\"_How many barrels will thy vengeance yield thee, even if thou gettest\nit, Captain Ahab?_\" I asked. \"_It will not fetch thee much in our\nNantucket market._\"\n\nHe looked at me angrily and started to say something. Then he\nshrugged.\n\n\"I know, Walt,\" he said. \"But you can't measure everything in barrels\nof whale oil. Or skins of tallow-wax.\"\n\nWhich was one of those perfectly true statements which are also\nperfectly meaningless. I gave up. My job's to get the news, not to\nmake it. I wondered if that meant anything, either.\n\nThey finally got the mob sorted out, after a lot of time wasted in\npillaging Ravick's living quarters on the fourth floor. _However, the\ntroops stopped to loot the enemy's camp._ I'd come across that line\nfifty to a hundred times in history books. Usually, it had been\nexpensive looting; if the enemy didn't counterattack, they managed, at\nleast, to escape. More to the point, they gathered up all the cannon\nand machine guns around the place and got them onto contragravity in\nthe street. There must have been close to five thousand men, by now,\nand those who couldn't crowd onto vehicles marched on foot, and the\nwhole mass, looking a little more like an army than a mob, started up\nBroadway.\n\nSince it is not proper for reporters to loot on the job, I had gotten\noutside in my jeep early and was going ahead, swinging my camera back\nto get the parade behind me. Might furnish a still-shot illustration\nfor somebody's History of Fenris in a century or so.\n\nBroadway was empty until we came to the gateway to the spaceport area.\nThere was a single medium combat car there, on contragravity halfway\nto the ceiling, with a pair of 50-mm guns and a rocket launcher\npointed at us, and under it, on the roadway, a solitary man in an\nolive-green uniform stood.\n\nI knew him; Lieutenant Ranjit Singh, Captain Courtland's\nsecond-in-command. He was a Sikh. Instead of a steel helmet, he wore a\nstriped turban, and he had a black beard that made Joe Kivelson's\nblond one look like Tom Kivelson's chin-fuzz. On his belt, along with\nhis pistol, he wore the little kirpan, the dagger all Sikhs carry. He\nalso carried a belt radio, and as we approached he lifted the phone to\nhis mouth and a loudspeaker on the combat car threw his voice at us:\n\n\"All right, that's far enough, now. The first vehicle that comes\nwithin a hundred yards of this gate will be shot down.\"\n\nOne man, and one combat car, against five thousand, with twenty-odd\nguns and close to a hundred machine guns. He'd last about as long as a\npint of trade gin at a Sheshan funeral. The only thing was, before he\nand the crew of the combat car were killed, they'd wipe out about ten\nor fifteen of our vehicles and a couple of hundred men, and they would\nbe the men and vehicles in the lead.\n\nMobs are a little different from soldiers, and our Rebel Army was\nstill a mob. Mobs don't like to advance into certain death, and they\ndon't like to advance over the bodies and wreckage of their own\nforward elements. Neither do soldiers, but soldiers will do it.\nSoldiers realize, when they put on the uniform, that some day they may\nface death in battle, and if this is it, this is it.\n\nI got the combat car and the lone soldier in the turban--that would\nlook good in anybody's history book--and moved forward, taking care\nthat he saw the _Times_ lettering on the jeep and taking care to stay\nwell short of the deadline. I let down to the street and got out,\ntaking off my gun belt and hanging it on the control handle of the\njeep. Then I walked forward.\n\n\"Lieutenant Ranjit,\" I said, \"I'm representing the _Times_. I have\nbusiness inside the spaceport. I want to get the facts about this. It\nmay be that when I get this story, these people will be satisfied.\"\n\n\"We will, like Nifflheim!\" I heard Joe Kivelson bawling, above and\nbehind me. \"We want the men who started the fire my son got burned\nin.\"\n\n\"Is that the Kivelson boy's father?\" the Sikh asked me, and when I\nnodded, he lifted the phone to his lips again. \"Captain Kivelson,\" the\nloudspeaker said, \"your son is alive and under skin-grafting treatment\nhere at the spaceport hospital. His life is not, repeat not, in\ndanger. The men you are after are here, under guard. If any of them\nare guilty of any crimes, and if you can show any better authority\nthan an armed mob to deal with them, they may, may, I said, be turned\nover for trial. But they will not be taken from this spaceport by\nforce, as long as I or one of my men remains alive.\"\n\n\"That's easy. We'll get them afterward,\" Joe Kivelson shouted.\n\n\"Somebody may. You won't,\" Ranjit Singh told him. \"Van Steen, hit that\nship's boat first, and hit it at the first hostile move anybody in\nthis mob makes.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. With pleasure,\" another voice replied.\n\nNobody in the Rebel Army, if that was what it still was, had any\ncomment to make on that. Lieutenant Ranjit turned to me.\n\n\"Mr. Boyd,\" he said. None of this sonny-boy stuff; Ranjit Singh was a\nman of dignity, and he respected the dignity of others. \"If I admit\nyou to the spaceport, will you give these people the facts exactly as\nyou learn them?\"\n\n\"That's what the _Times_ always does, Lieutenant.\" Well, almost all\nthe facts almost always.\n\n\"Will you people accept what this _Times_ reporter tells you he has\nlearned?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course.\" That was Oscar Fujisawa.\n\n\"I won't!\" That was Joe Kivelson. \"He's always taking the part of that\nold rumpot of a Bish Ware.\"\n\n\"Lieutenant, that remark was a slur on my paper, as well as myself,\" I\nsaid. \"Will you permit Captain Kivelson to come in along with me? And\nsomebody else,\" I couldn't resist adding, \"so that people will believe\nhim?\"\n\nRanjit Singh considered that briefly. He wasn't afraid to die--I\nbelieve he was honestly puzzled when he heard people talking about\nfear--but his job was to protect some fugitives from a mob, not to die\na useless hero's death. If letting in a small delegation would prevent\nan attack on the spaceport without loss of life and ammunition--or\nmaybe he reversed the order of importance--he was obliged to try it.\n\n\"Yes. You may choose five men to accompany Mr. Boyd,\" he said. \"They\nmay not bring weapons in with them. Sidearms,\" he added, \"will not\ncount as weapons.\"\n\nAfter all, a kirpan was a sidearm, and his religion required him to\ncarry that. The decision didn't make me particularly happy. Respect\nfor the dignity of others is a fine thing in an officer, but like\njournalistic respect for facts, it can be carried past the point of\nbeing a virtue. I thought he was over-estimating Joe Kivelson's\nself-control.\n\nVehicles in front began grounding, and men got out and bunched\ntogether on the street. Finally, they picked their delegation: Joe\nKivelson, Oscar Fujisawa, Casmir Oughourlian the shipyard man, one of\nthe engineers at the nutrient plant, and the Reverend Hiram Zilker,\nthe Orthodox-Monophysite preacher. They all had pistols, even the\nReverend Zilker, so I went back to the jeep and put mine on. Ranjit\nSingh had switched his radio off the speaker and was talking to\nsomebody else. After a while, an olive-green limousine piloted by a\npoliceman in uniform and helmet floated in and grounded. The six of us\ngot into it, and it lifted again.\n\nThe car let down in a vehicle hall in the administrative area, and the\npolice second lieutenant, Chris Xantos, was waiting alone, armed only\nwith the pistol that was part of his uniform and wearing a beret\ninstead of a helmet. He spoke to us, and ushered us down a hallway\ntoward Guido Fieschi's office.\n\nI get into the spaceport administrative area about once in twenty or\nso hours. Oughourlian is a somewhat less frequent visitor. The others\nhad never been there, and they were visibly awed by all the gleaming\nglass and brightwork, and the soft lights and the thick carpets. All\nPort Sandor ought to look like this, I thought. It could, and maybe\nnow it might, after a while.\n\nThere were six chairs in a semicircle facing Guido Fieschi's desk, and\nthree men sitting behind it. Fieschi, who had changed clothes and\nwashed since the last time I saw him, sat on the extreme right.\nCaptain Courtland, with his tight mouth under a gray mustache and the\nquadruple row of medal ribbons on his breast, was on the left. In the\nmiddle, the seat of honor, was Bish Ware, looking as though he were\npresiding over a church council to try some rural curate for heresy.\n\nAs soon as Joe Kivelson saw him, he roared angrily:\n\n\"There's the dirty traitor who sold us out! He's the worst of the lot;\nI wouldn't be surprised if--\"\n\nBish looked at him like a bishop who has just been contradicted on a\npoint of doctrine by a choirboy.\n\n\"Be quiet!\" he ordered. \"I did not follow this man you call Ravick\nhere to this ... this running-hot-and-cold Paradise planet, and I did\nnot spend five years fraternizing with its unwashed citizenry and\ncreating for myself the role of town drunkard of Port Sandor, to have\nhim taken from me and lynched after I have arrested him. People do not\nlynch my prisoners.\"\n\n\"And who in blazes are you?\" Joe demanded.\n\nBish took cognizance of the question, if not the questioner.\n\n\"Tell them, if you please, Mr. Fieschi,\" he said.\n\n\"Well, Mr. Ware is a Terran Federation Executive Special Agent,\"\nFieschi said. \"Captain Courtland and I have known that for the past\nfive years. As far as I know, nobody else was informed of Mr. Ware's\nposition.\"\n\nAfter that, you could have heard a gnat sneeze.\n\nEverybody knows about Executive Special Agents. There are all kinds of\nsecret agents operating in the Federation--Army and Navy Intelligence,\npolice of different sorts, Colonial Office agents, private detectives,\nChartered Company agents. But there are fewer Executive Specials than\nthere are inhabited planets in the Federation. They rank, ex officio,\nas Army generals and Space Navy admirals; they have the privilege of\nthe floor in Parliament, they take orders from nobody but the\nPresident of the Federation. But very few people have ever seen one,\nor talked to anybody who has.\n\nAnd Bish Ware--_good ol' Bish; he'sh everybodysh frien'_--was one of\nthem. And I had been trying to make a man of him and reform him. I'd\neven thought, if he stopped drinking, he might make a success as a\nprivate detective--at Port Sandor, on Fenris! I wondered what color\nmy face had gotten now, and I started looking around for a crack in\nthe floor, to trickle gently and unobtrusively into.\n\nAnd it should have been obvious to me, maybe not that he was an\nExecutive Special, but that he was certainly no drunken barfly. The\nway he'd gone four hours without a drink, and seemed to be just as\ndrunk as ever. That was right--just as drunk as he'd ever been; which\nwas to say, cold sober. There was the time I'd seen him catch that\nfalling bottle and set it up. No drunken man could have done that; a\nman's reflexes are the first thing to be affected by alcohol. And the\nway he shot that tread-snail. I've seen men who could shoot well on\nliquor, but not quick-draw stuff. That calls for perfect\nco-ordination. And the way he went into his tipsy act at the\n_Times_--veteran actor slipping into a well-learned role.\n\nHe drank, sure. He did a lot of drinking. But there are men whose\nsystems resist the effects of alcohol better than others, and he must\nhave been an exceptional example of the type, or he'd never have\nadopted the sort of cover personality he did. It would have been\nfairly easy for him. Space his drinks widely, and never take a drink\nunless he _had_ to, to maintain the act. When he was at the Times with\njust Dad and me, what did he have? A fruit fizz.\n\nWell, at least I could see it after I had my nose rubbed in it. Joe\nKivelson was simply gaping at him. The Reverend Zilker seemed to be\nhaving trouble adjusting, too. The shipyard man and the chemical\nengineer weren't saying anything, but it had kicked them for a loss,\ntoo. Oscar Fujisawa was making a noble effort to be completely\nunsurprised. Oscar is one of our better poker players.\n\n\"I thought it might be something like that,\" he lied brazenly. \"But,\nBish ... Excuse me, I mean, Mr. Ware...\"\n\n\"Bish, if you please, Oscar.\"\n\n\"Bish, what I'd like to know is what you wanted with Ravick,\" he said.\n\"They didn't send any Executive Special Agent here for five years to\ninvestigate this tallow-wax racket of his.\"\n\n\"No. We have been looking for him for a long time. Fifteen years, and\nI've been working on it that long. You might say, I have made a career\nof him. Steve Ravick is really Anton Gerrit.\"\n\nMaybe he was expecting us to leap from our chairs and cry out, \"Aha!\nThe infamous Anton Gerrit! Brought to book at last!\" We didn't. We\njust looked at one another, trying to connect some meaning to the\nname. It was Joe Kivelson, of all people, who caught the first gleam.\n\n\"I know that name,\" he said. \"Something on Loki, wasn't it?\"\n\nYes; that was it. Now that my nose was rubbed in it again, I got it.\n\n\"The Loki enslavements. Was that it?\" I asked. \"I read about it, but I\nnever seem to have heard of Gerrit.\"\n\n\"He was the mastermind. The ones who were caught, fifteen years ago,\nwere the underlings, but Ravick was the real Number One. He was\nresponsible for the enslavement of from twenty to thirty thousand\nLokian natives, gentle, harmless, friendly people, most of whom were\nworked to death in the mines.\"\n\nNo wonder an Executive Special would put in fifteen years looking for\nhim. You murder your grandmother, or rob a bank, or burn down an\norphanage with the orphans all in bed upstairs, or something trivial\nlike that, and if you make an off-planet getaway, you're reasonably\nsafe. Of course there's such a thing as extradition, but who bothers?\nDistances are too great, and communication is too slow, and the\nFederation depends on every planet to do its own policing.\n\nBut enslavement's something different. The Terran Federation is a\ngovernment of and for--if occasionally not by--all sapient peoples of\nall races. The Federation Constitution guarantees equal rights to all.\nMaking slaves of people, human or otherwise, is a direct blow at\neverything the Federation stands for. No wonder they kept hunting\nfifteen years for the man responsible for the Loki enslavements.\n\n\"Gerrit got away, with a month's start. By the time we had traced him\nto Baldur, he had a year's start on us. He was five years ahead of us\nwhen we found out that he'd gone from Baldur to Odin. Six years ago,\nnine years after we'd started hunting for him, we decided, from the\nbest information we could get, that he had left Odin on one of the\nlocal-stop ships for Terra, and dropped off along the way. There are\nsix planets at which those Terra-Odin ships stop. We sent a man to\neach of them. I drew this prize out of the hat.\n\n\"When I landed here, I contacted Mr. Fieschi, and we found that a man\nanswering to Gerrit's description had come in on the _Peenem\u00fcnde_ from\nOdin seven years before, about the time Gerrit had left Odin. The man\nwho called himself Steve Ravick. Of course, he didn't look anything\nlike the pictures of Gerrit, but facial surgery was something we'd\ntaken for granted he'd have done. I finally managed to get his\nfingerprints.\"\n\nSpecial Agent Ware took out a cigar, inspected it with the drunken\noversolemnity he'd been drilling himself into for five years, and lit\nit. Then he saw what he was using and rose, holding it out, and I went\nto the desk and took back my lighter-weapon.\n\n\"Thank you, Walt. I wouldn't have been able to do this if I hadn't had\nthat. Where was I? Oh, yes. I got Gerrit-alias-Ravick's fingerprints,\nwhich did not match the ones we had on file for Gerrit, and sent them\nin. It was eighteen months later that I got a reply on them. According\nto his fingerprints, Steve Ravick was really a woman named Ernestine\nCoy\u00f3n, who had died of acute alcoholism in the free public ward of a\nhospital at Paris-on-Baldur fourteen years ago.\"\n\n\"Why, that's incredible!\" the Reverend Zilker burst out, and Joe\nKivelson was saying: \"Steve Ravick isn't any woman....\"\n\n\"Least of all one who died fourteen years ago,\" Bish agreed. \"But the\nfingerprints were hers. A pauper, dying in a public ward of a big\nhospital. And a man who has to change his identity, and who has small,\nwoman-sized hands. And a crooked hospital staff surgeon. You get the\npicture now?\"\n\n\"They're doing the same thing on Tom's back, right here,\" I told Joe.\n\"Only you can't grow fingerprints by carniculture, the way you can\nhuman tissue for grafting. They had to have palm and finger surfaces\nfrom a pair of real human hands. A pauper, dying in a free-treatment\nward, her body shoved into a mass-energy converter.\" Then I thought\nof something else. \"That showoff trick of his, crushing out cigarettes\nin his palm,\" I said.\n\nBish nodded commendingly. \"Exactly. He'd have about as much sensation\nin his palms as I'd have wearing thick leather gloves. I'd noticed\nthat.\n\n\"Well, six months going, and a couple of months waiting on reports\nfrom other planets, and six months coming, and so on, it wasn't until\nthe _Peenem\u00fcnde_ got in from Terra, the last time, that I got final\nconfirmation. Dr. Watson, you'll recall.\"\n\n\"Who, you perceived, had been in Afghanistan,\" I mentioned, trying to\nsalvage something. Showing off. The one I was trying to impress was\nWalt Boyd.\n\n\"You caught that? Careless of me,\" Bish chided himself. \"What he gave\nme was a report that they had finally located a man who had been a\nstaff surgeon at this hospital on Baldur at the time. He's now doing a\nstretch for another piece of malpractice he was unlucky enough to get\ncaught at later. We will not admit making deals with any criminals, in\njail or out, but he is willing to testify, and is on his way to Terra\nnow. He can identify pictures of Anton Gerrit as those of the man he\noperated on fourteen years ago, and his testimony and Ernestine\nCoy\u00f3n's fingerprints will identify Ravick as that man. With all the\nColonial Constabulary and Army Intelligence people got on Gerrit on\nLoki, simple identification will be enough. Gerrit was proven guilty\nlong ago, and it won't be any trouble, now, to prove that Ravick is\nGerrit.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you arrest him as soon as you got the word from your\nfriend from Afghanistan?\" I wanted to know.\n\n\"Good question; I've been asking myself that,\" Bish said, a trifle\nwryly. \"If I had, the _Javelin_ wouldn't have been bombed, that wax\nwouldn't have been burned, and Tom Kivelson wouldn't have been\ninjured. What I did was send my friend, who is a Colonial Constabulary\ndetective, to Gimli, the next planet out. There's a Navy base there,\nand always at least a couple of destroyers available. He's coming back\nwith one of them to pick Gerrit up and take him to Terra. They ought\nto be in in about two hundred and fifty hours. I thought it would be\nsafer all around to let Gerrit run loose till then. There's no place\nhe could go.\n\n\"What I didn't realize, at the time, was what a human H-bomb this man\nMurell would turn into. Then everything blew up at once. Finally, I\nwas left with the choice of helping Gerrit escape from Hunters' Hall\nor having him lynched before I could arrest him.\" He turned to\nKivelson. \"In the light of what you knew, I don't blame you for\ncalling me a dirty traitor.\"\n\n\"But how did I know...\" Kivelson began.\n\n\"That's right. You weren't supposed to. That was before you found out.\nYou ought to have heard what Gerrit and Belsher--as far as I know,\nthat is his real name--called me after they found out, when they got\nout of that jeep and Captain Courtland's men snapped the handcuffs on\nthem. It even shocked a hardened sinner like me.\"\n\nThere was a lot more of it. Bish had managed to get into Hunters' Hall\njust about the time Al Devis and his companion were starting the fire\nRavick--Gerrit--had ordered for a diversion. The whole gang was going\nto crash out as soon as the fire had attracted everybody away. Bish\nled them out onto the Second Level Down, sleep-gassed the lone man in\nthe jeep, and took them to the spaceport, where the police were\nwaiting for them.\n\nAs soon as I'd gotten everything, I called the _Times_. I'd had my\nradio on all the time, and it had been coming in perfectly. Dad, I was\nhappy to observe, was every bit as flabbergasted as I had been at who\nand what Bish Ware was. He might throw my campaign to reform Bish up\nat me later on, but at the moment he wasn't disposed to, and I was\npraising Allah silently that I hadn't had a chance to mention the\ndetective agency idea to him. That would have been a little too much.\n\n\"What are they doing about Belsher and Hallstock?\" he asked.\n\n\"Belsher goes back to Terra with Ravick. Gerrit, I mean. That's where\nhe collected his cut on the tallow-wax, so that is where he'd have to\nbe tried. Bish is convinced that somebody in Kapstaad Chemical must\nhave been involved, too. Hallstock is strictly a local matter.\"\n\n\"That's about what I thought. With all this interstellar\nback-and-forth, it'll be a long time before we'll be able to write\nthirty under the story.\"\n\n\"Well, we can put thirty under the Steve Ravick story,\" I said.\n\nThen it hit me. The Steve Ravick story was finished; that is, the\nlocal story of racketeer rule in the Hunters' Co-operative. But the\nAnton Gerrit story was something else. That was Federation-wide news;\nthe end of a fifteen-year manhunt for the most wanted criminal in the\nknown Galaxy. And who had that story, right in his hot little hand?\nWalter Boyd, the ace--and only--reporter for the mighty Port Sandor\n_Times_.\n\n\"Yes,\" I continued. \"The Ravick story's finished. But we still have\nthe Anton Gerrit story, and I'm going to work on it right now.\"\n\n\n\n\n20\n\nFINALE\n\n\nThey had Tom Kivelson in a private room at the hospital; he was\nsitting up in a chair, with a lot of pneumatic cushions around him,\nand a lunch tray on his lap. He looked white and thin. He could move\none arm completely, but the bandages they had loaded him with seemed\nto have left the other free only at the elbow. He was concentrating on\nhis lunch, and must have thought I was one of the nurses, or a doctor,\nor something of the sort.\n\n\"Are you going to let me have a cigarette and a cup of coffee, when\nI'm through with this?\" he asked.\n\n\"Well, I don't have any coffee, but you can have one of my\ncigarettes,\" I said.\n\nThen he looked up and gave a whoop. \"Walt! How'd you get in here? I\nthought they weren't going to let anybody in to see me till this\nafternoon.\"\n\n\"Power of the press,\" I told him. \"Bluff, blarney, and blackmail. How\nare they treating you?\"\n\n\"Awful. Look what they gave me for lunch. I thought we were on short\nrations down on Hermann Reuch's Land. How's Father?\"\n\n\"He's all right. They took the splint off, but he still has to carry\nhis arm in a sling.\"\n\n\"Lucky guy; he can get around on his feet, and I'll bet he isn't\nstarving, either. You know, speaking about food, I'm going to feel\nlike a cannibal eating carniculture meat, now. My whole back's\ncarniculture.\" He filled his mouth with whatever it was they were\nfeeding him and asked, through it: \"Did I miss Steve Ravick's\nhanging?\"\n\nI was horrified. \"Haven't these people told you anything?\" I demanded.\n\n\"Nah; they wouldn't even tell me the right time. Afraid it would\nexcite me.\"\n\nSo I told him; first who Bish Ware really was, and then who Ravick\nreally was. He gaped for a moment, and then shoveled in more food.\n\n\"Go on; what happened?\"\n\nI told him how Bish had smuggled Gerrit and Leo Belsher out on Second\nLevel Down and gotten them to the spaceport, where Courtland's men had\nbeen waiting for them.\n\n\"Gerrit's going to Terra, and from there to Loki. They want the\nnatives to see what happens to a Terran who breaks Terran law; teach\nthem that our law isn't just to protect us. Belsher's going to Terra,\ntoo. There was a big ship captains' meeting; they voted to reclaim\ntheir wax and sell it individually to Murell, but to retain membership\nin the Co-op. They think they'll have to stay in the Co-op to get\nanything that's gettable out of Gerrit's and Belsher's money. Oscar\nFujisawa and Ces\u00e1rio Vieira are going to Terra on the _Cape Canaveral_\nto start suit to recover anything they can, and also to petition for\nreclassification of Fenris. Oscar's coming back on the next ship, but\nCes\u00e1rio's going to stay on as the Co-op representative. I suppose he\nand Linda will be getting married.\"\n\n\"Natch. They'll both stay on Terra, I suppose. Hey, whattaya know!\nCes\u00e1rio's getting off Fenris without having to die and reincarnate.\"\n\nHe finished his lunch, such as it was and what there was of it, and I\nrelieved him of the tray and set it on the floor beyond his chair. I\nfound an ashtray and lit a cigarette for him and one for myself, using\nthe big lighter. Tom looked at it dubiously, predicting that sometime\nI'd push the wrong thing and send myself bye-byes for a couple of\nhours. I told him how Bish had used it.\n\n\"Bet a lot of people wanted to hang him, too, before they found out\nwho he was and what he'd really done. What's my father think of Bish,\nnow?\"\n\n\"Bish Ware is a great and good man, and the savior of Fenris,\" I said.\n\"And he was real smart, to keep an act like that up for five years.\nYour father modestly admits that it even fooled him.\"\n\n\"Bet Oscar Fujisawa knew it all along.\"\n\n\"Well, Oscar modestly admits that he suspected something of the sort,\nbut he didn't feel it was his place to say anything.\"\n\nTom laughed, and then wanted to know if they were going to hang Mort\nHallstock. \"I hope they wait till I can get out of here.\"\n\n\"No, Odin Dock & Shipyard claim he's a political refugee and they\nwon't give him up. They did loan us a couple of accountants to go over\nthe city books, to see if we could find any real evidence of\nmisappropriation, and whattaya know, there were no city books. The\ncity of Port Sandor didn't keep books. We can't even take that three\nhundred thousand sols away from him; for all we can prove, he saved\nthem out of his five-thousand-sol-a-year salary. He's shipping out on\nthe _Cape Canaveral_, too.\"\n\n\"Then we don't have any government at all!\"\n\n\"Are you fooling yourself we ever had one?\"\n\n\"No, but--\"\n\n\"Well, we have one now. A temporary dictatorship; Bish Ware is\ndictator. Fieschi loaned him Ranjit Singh and some of his men. The\nfirst thing he did was gather up the city treasurer and the chief of\npolice and march them to the spaceport; Fieschi made Hallstock buy\nthem tickets, too. But there aren't going to be any unofficial\nhangings. This is a law-abiding planet, now.\"\n\nA nurse came in, and disapproved of Tom smoking and of me being in the\nroom at all.\n\n\"Haven't you had your lunch yet?\" she asked Tom.\n\nHe looked at her guilelessly and said, \"No; I was waiting for it.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll get it,\" she said. \"I thought the other nurse had brought\nit.\" She started out, and then she came back and had to fuss with his\ncushions, and then she saw the tray on the floor.\n\n\"You did so have your lunch!\" she accused.\n\nTom looked at her as innocently as ever. \"Oh, you mean these samples?\nWhy, they were good; I'll take all of them. And a big slab of roast\nbeef, and brown gravy, and mashed potatoes. And how about some ice\ncream?\"\n\nIt was a good try; too bad it didn't work.\n\n\"Don't worry, Tom,\" I told him. \"I'll get my lawyer to spring you out\nof this jug, and then we'll take you to my place and fill you up on\nMrs. Laden's cooking.\"\n\nThe nurse sniffed. She suspected, quite correctly, that whoever Mrs.\nLaden was, she didn't know anything about scientific dietetics.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen I got back to the _Times_, Dad and Julio had had their lunch and\nwere going over the teleprint edition. Julio was printing corrections\non blank sheets of plastic and Dad was cutting them out and cementing\nthem over things that needed correcting on the master sheets. I gave\nJulio a short item to the effect that Tom Kivelson, son of Captain and\nMrs. Joe Kivelson, one of the _Javelin_ survivors who had been burned\nin the tallow-wax fire, was now out of all danger, and recovering. Dad\nwas able to scrounge that onto the first page.\n\nThere was a lot of other news. The T.F.N. destroyer _Sim\u00f3n Bolivar_,\nen route from Gimli to pick up the notorious Anton Gerrit, alias Steve\nRavick, had come out of hyperspace and into radio range. Dad had\ntalked to the skipper by screen and gotten interviews, which would be\ntelecast, both with him and Detective-Major MacBride of the Colonial\nConstabulary. The _Sim\u00f3n Bolivar_ would not make landing, but go into\norbit and send down a boat. Detective-Major MacBride (alias Dr. John\nWatson) would remain on Fenris to take over local police activities.\n\nMore evidence had been unearthed at Hunters' Hall on the frauds\npracticed by Leo Belsher and Gerrit-alias-Ravick; it looked as though\na substantial sum of money might be recovered, eventually, from the\nbank accounts and other holdings of both men on Terra. Acting\nResident-Agent Gonzalo Ware--Ware, it seemed, really was his right\nname, but look what he had in front of it--had promulgated more\nregulations and edicts, and a crackdown on the worst waterfront dives\nwas in progress. I'll bet the devoted flock was horrified at what\ntheir beloved bishop had turned into. Bish would leave his diocese in\na lot healthier condition than he'd found it, that was one thing for\nsure. And most of the gang of thugs and plug-uglies who had been used\nto intimidate and control the Hunters' Co-operative had been gathered\nup and jailed on vagrancy charges; prisoners were being put to work\ncleaning up the city.\n\nAnd there was a lot about plans for a registration of voters, and\norganization of election boards, and a local electronics-engineering\nfirm had been awarded a contract for voting machines. I didn't think\nthere had ever been a voting machine on Fenris before.\n\n\"The commander of the _Bolivar_ says he'll take your story to Terra\nwith him, and see that it gets to Interworld News,\" Dad told me as we\nwere sorting the corrected master sheets and loading them into the\nphotoprint machine, to be sent out on the air. \"The _Bolivar_'ll make\nTerra at least two hundred hours ahead of the _Cape Canaveral_.\nInterworld will be glad to have it. It isn't often they get a story\nlike that with the first news of anything, and this'll be a big\nstory.\"\n\n\"You shouldn't have given me the exclusive by-line,\" I said. \"You did\nas much work on it as I did.\"\n\n\"No, I didn't, either,\" he contradicted, \"and I knew what I was\ndoing.\"\n\nWith the work done, I remembered that I hadn't had anything to eat\nsince breakfast, and I went down to take inventory of the\nrefrigerator. Dad went along with me, and after I had assembled a\nlunch and sat down to it, he decided that his pipe needed refilling,\nlit it, poured a cup of coffee and sat down with me.\n\n\"You know, Walt, I've been thinking, lately,\" he began.\n\nOh-oh, I thought. When Dad makes that remark, in just that tone, it's\nall hands to secure ship for diving.\n\n\"We've all had to do a lot of thinking, lately,\" I agreed.\n\n\"Yes. You know, they want me to be mayor of Port Sandor.\"\n\nI nodded and waited till I got my mouth empty. I could see a lot of\nsense in that. Dad is honest and scrupulous and public-spirited; too\nmuch so, sometimes, for his own good. There wasn't any question of his\nability, and while there had always been antagonism between the\nhunter-ship crews and waterfront people and the uptown business crowd,\nDad was well liked and trusted by both parties.\n\n\"Are you going to take it?\" I asked.\n\n\"I suppose I'll have to, if they really want me. Be a sort of\nobligation.\"\n\nThat would throw a lot more work on me. Dad could give some attention\nto the paper as mayor, but not as much as now.\n\n\"What do you want me to try to handle for you?\" I asked.\n\n\"Well, Walt, that's what I've been thinking about,\" he said. \"I've\nbeen thinking about it for a long time, and particularly since things\ngot changed around here. I think you ought to go to school some more.\"\n\nThat made me laugh. \"What, back to Hartzenbosch?\" I asked. \"I could\nteach him more than he could teach me, now.\"\n\n\"I doubt that, Walt. Professor Hartzenbosch may be an old maid in\ntrousers, but he's really a very sound scholar. But I wasn't thinking\nabout that. I was thinking about your going to Terra to school.\"\n\n\"Huh?\" I forgot to eat, for a moment. \"Let's stop kidding.\"\n\n\"I didn't start kidding; I meant it.\"\n\n\"Well, think again, Dad. It costs money to go to school on Terra. It\neven costs money to go to Terra.\"\n\n\"We have a little money, Walt. Maybe more than you think we do. And\nwith things getting better, we'll lease more teleprinters and get more\nadvertising. You're likely to get better than the price of your\npassage out of that story we're sending off on the _Bolivar_, and that\nwon't be the end of it, either. Fenris is going to be in the news for\na while. You may make some more money writing. That's why I was\ncareful to give you the by-line on that Gerrit story.\" His pipe had\ngone out again; he took time out to relight it, and then added:\n\"Anything I spend on this is an investment. The _Times_ will get it\nback.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's another thing; the paper,\" I said. \"If you're going to be\nmayor, you won't be able to do everything you're doing on the paper\nnow, and then do all my work too.\"\n\n\"Well, shocking as the idea may be, I think we can find somebody to\nreplace you.\"\n\n\"Name one,\" I challenged.\n\n\"Well, Lillian Arnaz, at the Library, has always been interested in\nnewspaper work,\" he began.\n\n\"A girl!\" I hooted. \"You have any idea of some of the places I have to\ngo to get stories?\"\n\n\"Yes. I have always deplored the necessity. But a great many of them\nhave been closed lately, and the rest are being run in a much more\nseemly manner. And she wouldn't be the only reporter. I hesitate to\ngive you any better opinion of yourself than you have already, but it\nwould take at least three people to do the work you've been doing.\nWhen you get back from Terra, you'll find the _Times_ will have a very\nrespectable reportorial staff.\"\n\n\"What'll I be, then?\" I wondered.\n\n\"Editor,\" Dad told me. \"I'll retire and go into politics full time.\nAnd if Fenris is going to develop the way I believe it will, the\neditor of the _Times_ will need a much better education than I have.\"\n\nI kept on eating, to give myself an excuse for silence. He was right,\nI knew that. But college on Terra; why, that would be at least four\nyears, maybe five, and then a year for the round trip....\n\n\"Walt, this doesn't have to be settled right away,\" Dad said. \"You\nwon't be going on the _Sim\u00f3n Bolivar_, along with Ravick and Belsher.\nAnd that reminds me. Have you talked to Bish lately? He'd be hurt if\nyou didn't see him before he left.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe truth was, I'd been avoiding Bish, and not just because I knew how\nbusy he was. My face felt like a tallow-wax fire every time I thought\nof how I'd been trying to reform him, and I didn't quite know what I'd\nbe able to say to him if I met him again. And he seemed to me to be an\nentirely different person, as though the old Bish Ware, whom I had\nliked in spite of what I'd thought he was, had died, and some total\nstranger had taken his place.\n\nBut I went down to the Municipal Building. It didn't look like the\nsame place. The walls had been scrubbed; the floors were free from\nlitter. All the drove of loafers and hangers-on had been run out, or\nmaybe jailed and put to work. I looked into a couple of offices;\neverybody in them was busy. A few of the old police force were still\nthere, but their uniforms had been cleaned and pressed, they had all\nshaved recently, and one or two looked as though they liked being able\nto respect themselves, for a change.\n\nThe girl at the desk in the mayor's outside office told me Bish had a\ndelegation of uptown merchants, who seemed to think that reform was\nall right in its place but it oughtn't to be carried more than a few\nblocks above the waterfront. They were protesting the new sanitary\nregulations. Then she buzzed Bish on the handphone, and told me he'd\nsee me in a few minutes. After a while, I heard the delegation going\ndown the hall from the private office door. One of them was saying:\n\n\"Well, this is what we've always been screaming our heads off for. Now\nwe've got it good and hard; we'll just have to get used to it.\"\n\nWhen I went in, Bish rose from his desk and came to meet me, shaking\nmy hand. He looked and was dressed like the old Bish Ware I'd always\nknown.\n\n\"Glad you dropped in, Walt. Find a seat. How are things on the\n_Times_?\"\n\n\"You ought to know. You're making things busy for us.\"\n\n\"Yes. There's so much to do, and so little time to do it. Seems as\nthough I've heard somebody say that before.\"\n\n\"Are you going back to Terra on the _Sim\u00f3n Bolivar_?\"\n\n\"Oh, Allah forbid! I made a trip on a destroyer, once, and once is\nenough for a lifetime. I won't even be able to go on the _Cape\nCanaveral_; I'll take the _Peenem\u00fcnde_ when she gets in. I'm glad\nMacBride--Dr. Watson--is going to stop off. He'll be a big help. Don't\nknow what I'd have done without Ranjit Singh.\"\n\n\"That won't be till after the _Cape Canaveral_ gets back from Terra.\"\n\n\"No. That's why I'm waiting. Don't publish this, Walt, I don't want to\nstart any premature rumors that might end in disappointments, but I've\nrecommended immediate reclassification to Class III, and there may be\na Colonial Office man on the _Cape Canaveral_ when she gets in.\nResident-Agent, permanent. I hope so; he'll need a little breaking\nin.\"\n\n\"I saw Tom Kivelson this morning,\" I said. \"He seems to be getting\nalong pretty well.\"\n\n\"Didn't anybody at the hospital tell you about him?\" Bish asked.\n\nI shook my head. He cursed all hospital staffs.\n\n\"I wish military security was half as good. Why, Tom's permanently\ninjured. He won't be crippled, or anything like that, but there was\nconsiderable unrepairable damage to his back muscles. He'll be able to\nget around, but I doubt it he'll ever be able to work on a hunter-ship\nagain.\"\n\nI was really horrified. Monster-hunting was Tom's whole life. I said\nsomething like that.\n\n\"He'll just have to make a new life for himself. Joe says he's going\nto send him to school on Terra. He thinks that was his own idea, but I\nsuggested it to him.\"\n\n\"Dad wants me to go to school on Terra.\"\n\n\"Well, that's a fine idea. Tom's going on the _Peenem\u00fcnde_, along with\nme. Why don't you come with us?\"\n\n\"That would be great, Bish. I'd like it. But I just can't.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Well, they want Dad to be mayor, and if he runs, they'll all vote for\nhim. He can't handle this and the paper both alone.\"\n\n\"He can get help on both jobs.\"\n\n\"Yes, but ... Why, it would be years till I got back. I can't\nsacrifice the time. Not now.\"\n\n\"I'd say six years. You can spend your voyage time from here cramming\nfor entrance qualifications. Schools don't bother about academic\ncredits any more; they're only interested in how much you know. You\ntake four years' regular college, and a year postgrading, and you'll\nhave all the formal education you'll need.\"\n\n\"But, Bish, I can get that here, at the Library,\" I said. \"We have\nevery book on film that's been published since the Year Zero.\"\n\n\"Yes. And you'd die of old age before you got a quarter through the\nfirst film bank, and you still wouldn't have an education. Do you know\nwhich books to study, and which ones not to bother with? Or which ones\nto read first, so that what you read in the others will be\ncomprehensible to you? That's what they'll give you on Terra. The\ntools, which you don't have now, for educating yourself.\"\n\nI thought that over. It made sense. I'd had a lot of the very sort of\ntrouble he'd spoken of, trying to get information for myself in proper\norder, and I'd read a lot of books that duplicated other books I'd\nread, and books I had trouble understanding because I hadn't read some\nother book first. Bish had something there. I was sure he had. But six\nyears!\n\nI said that aloud, and added: \"I can't take the time. I have to be\ndoing things.\"\n\n\"You'll do things. You'll do them a lot better for waiting those six\nyears. You aren't eighteen yet. Six years is a whole third of your\npast life. No wonder it seems long to you. But you're thinking the\nwrong way; you're relating those six years to what has passed. Relate\nthem to what's ahead of you, and see how little time they are. You\ntake ordinary care of yourself and keep out of any more civil wars,\nand you have sixty more years, at least. Your six years at school are\nonly one-tenth of that. I was fifty when I came here to this Creator's\nblunder of a planet. Say I had only twenty more years; I spent a\nquarter of them playing town drunk here. I'm the one who ought to be\nin a rush and howling about lost time, not you. I ought to be in such\na hurry I'd take the _Sim\u00f3n Bolivar_ to Terra and let this place go\nto--to anywhere you might imagine to be worse.\"\n\n\"You know, I don't think you like Fenris.\"\n\n\"I don't. If I were a drinking man, this planet would have made a\ndrunkard of me. Now, you forget about these six years chopped out of\nyour busy life. When you get back here, with an education, you'll be a\nkid of twenty-four, with a big long life ahead of you and your mind\nstocked with things you don't have now that will help you make\nsomething--and more important, something enjoyable--out of it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a huge crowd at the spaceport to see us off, Tom and Bish\nWare and me. Mostly, it was for Bish. If I don't find a monument to\nhim when I get back, I'll know there is no such thing as gratitude.\nThere had been a big banquet for us the evening before, and I think\nBish actually got a little tipsy. Nobody can be sure, though; it might\nhave been just the old actor back in his role. Now they were all\ncrowding around us, as many as could jam in, in the main lounge of the\n_Peenem\u00fcnde_. Joe Kivelson and his wife. Dad and Julio and Mrs. Laden,\nwho was actually being cordial to Bish, and who had a bundle for us\nthat we weren't to open till we were in hyperspace. Lillian Arnaz, the\ngirl who was to take my place as star reporter. We were going to send\neach other audiovisuals; advice from me on the job, and news from the\n_Times_ from her. Glenn Murell, who had his office open by now and was\ngrumbling that there had been a man from Interstellar Import-Export\nout on the _Cape Canaveral_, and if the competition got any stiffer\nthe price of tallow-wax would be forced up on him to a sol a pound.\nAnd all the _Javelin_ hands who had been wrecked with us on Hermann\nReuch's Land, and the veterans of the Civil War, all but Oscar and\nCes\u00e1rio, who will be at the dock to meet us when we get to Terra.\n\nI wonder what it'll be like, on a world where you go to bed every time\nit gets dark and get up when it gets light, and can go outdoors all\nthe time. I wonder how I'll like college, and meeting people from all\nover the Federation, and swapping tall stories about our home planets.\n\nAnd I wonder what I'll learn. The long years ahead, I can't imagine\nthem now, will be spent on the _Times_, and I ought to learn things to\nfit me for that. But I can't get rid of the idea about carniculture\ngrowth of tallow-wax. We'll have to do something like that. The demand\nfor the stuff is growing, and we don't know how long it'll be before\nthe monsters are hunted out. We know how fast we're killing them, but\nwe don't know how many there are or how fast they breed. I'll talk to\nTom about that; maybe between us we can hit on something, or at least\nlay a foundation for somebody else who will.\n\nThe crowd pushed out and off the ship, and the three of us were alone,\nhere in the lounge of the _Peenem\u00fcnde_, where the story started and\nwhere it ends. Bish says no story ends, ever. He's wrong. Stories die,\nand nothing in the world is deader than a dead news story. But before\nthey do, they hatch a flock of little ones, and some of them grow into\nbigger stories still. What happens after the ship lifts into the\ndarkness, with the pre-dawn glow in the east, will be another, a new,\nstory.\n\nBut to the story of how the hunters got an honest co-operative and\nFenris got an honest government, and Bish Ware got Anton Gerrit the\nslaver, I can write\n\n\"The End.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_THE WORLDS OF H.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
