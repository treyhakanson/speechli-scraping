Much too good for them!\n\n\n_October 5, 1959_\n\nWell, here I am at Princeton. IFACS is quite a place, _quite_ a place,\nbut the atmosphere's darned informal. My colleagues seem to be mostly\nyoungish fellows dressed in sloppy dungarees, sweatshirts (the kind\nEinstein made so famous) and moccasins, and when they're not puttering\nin the labs they're likely to be lolling on the grass, lounging in\nfront of the fire in commons, or slouching around in conference rooms\nchalking up equations on a blackboard. No way of telling, of course,\nbut a lot of these collegiate-looking chaps must be in the MS end,\nwhatever that is. You'd think fellows in something secret like that\nwould dress and behave with a little more dignity.\n\nGuess I was a little previous in packing my soup-and-fish. Soon as I\nwas shown to my room in the bachelor dorms, I dug it out and hung it\nway back in the closet, out of sight. When in Rome, etc. Later that day\nI discovered they carry dungarees in the Co-op; luckily, they had the\npre-faded kind.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_October 6, 1959_\n\nMet the boss this morning--hardly out of his thirties, crew-cut,\nwearing a flannel hunting shirt and dirty saddleshoes. I was glad I'd\nthought to change into my dungarees before the interview.\n\n\"Parks,\" he said, \"you can count yourself a very fortunate young man.\nYou've come to the most important address in America, not excluding the\nPentagon. In the world, probably. To get you oriented, suppose I sketch\nin some of the background of the place.\"\n\nThat would be most helpful, I said. I wondered, though, if he was as\nnaive as he sounded. Did he think I'd been working in cybernetics labs\nfor going on six years without hearing enough rumors about IFACS to\nmake me dizzy? Especially about the MS end of IFACS?\n\n\"Maybe you know,\" he went on, \"that in the days of Oppenheimer and\nEinstein, this place was called the Institute for Advanced Studies.\nIt was run pretty loosely then--in addition to the mathematicians and\nphysicists, they had all sorts of queer ducks hanging around--poets,\negyptologists, numismatists, medievalists, herbalists, God alone knows\nwhat all. By 1955, however, so many cybernetics labs had sprung up\naround the country that we needed some central coordinating agency,\nso Washington arranged for us to take over here. Naturally, as soon\nas we arrived, we eased out the poets and egyptologists, brought in\nour own people, and changed the name to the Institute for Advanced\n_Cybernetics_ Studies. We've got some pretty keen projects going now,\n_pret_-ty keen.\"\n\nI said I'd bet, and did he have any idea which project I would fit into?\n\n\"Sure thing,\" he said. \"You're going to take charge of a very important\nlab. The Pro lab.\" I guess he saw my puzzled look. \"Pro--that's short\nfor prosthetics, artificial limbs. You know, it's really a scandal.\nWith our present level of technology, we should have artificial limbs\nwhich in many ways are even better than the originals, but actually\nwe're still making do with modifications of the same primitive, clumsy\npegs and hooks they were using a thousand years ago. I'm counting on\nyou to get things hopping in that department. It's a real challenge.\"\n\nI said it sure was a challenge, and of course I'd do my level best to\nmeet it. Still, I couldn't help feeling a bit disappointed. Around\ncybernetics circles, I hinted, you heard a lot of talk about the\nhush-hush MS work that was going on at IFACS and it sounded so exciting\nthat, well, a fellow sort of hoped he might get into _that_ end of\nthings.\n\n\"Look here, Parks,\" the boss said. He seemed a little peeved.\n\"Cybernetics is teamwork, and the first rule of any team is that not\neverybody can be quarterback. Each man has a specific job on our team,\none thing he's best suited for, and what _you're_ best suited for,\nobviously, is the Pro lab. We've followed your work closely these last\nfew years, and we were quite impressed by the way you handled those\nphoto-electric-cell insects. You pulled off a brilliant engineering\nstunt, you know, when you induced nervous breakdown in your robot\nmoths and bedbugs, and proved that the oscillations they developed\ncorresponded to those which the human animal develops in intention\ntremor and Parkinson's disease. A keen bit of cybernetic thinking,\nthat. _Very_ keen.\"\n\nIt was just luck, I told him modestly.\n\n\"Nonsense,\" the boss insisted. \"You're first and foremost a talented\nneuro man, and that's exactly what we need in the Pro department.\nThere, you see, the problem is primarily one of duplicating a nervous\nmechanism in the metal, of bridging the gap between the neuronic and\nelectronic. So buckle down, and if you hear any more gossip about MS,\nforget it fast--it's not a proper subject of conversation for you. The\nloyalty oath you signed is very specific about the trouble you can get\ninto with loose talk. Remember that.\"\n\nI said I certainly would, and thanks a whole lot for the advice.\n\nDamn! Everybody knows MS is the thing to get into. It gives you real\nstanding in the field if it gets around that you're an MS man. I had my\nheart set on getting into MS.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_October 6, 1959_\n\nIt never rains, etc.: now it turns out that Len Ellsom's here, and\n_he's_ in MS! Found out about it in a funny way. Two mornings a week,\nit seems, the staff members get into their skiing and hunting clothes\nand tramp into the woods to cut logs for their fireplaces. Well, this\nmorning I went with them, and as we were walking along the trail\nGoldweiser, my assistant, told me the idea behind these expeditions.\n\n\"You can't get away from it,\" he said. \"E=MC^2 is in a tree trunk\nas well as in a uranium atom or a solar system. When you're hacking\naway at a particular tree, though, you don't think much about such\nintangibles--like any good, untheoretical lumberjack, you're a lot\nmore concerned with superficialities, such as which way the grain\nruns, how to avoid the knots, and so on. It's very restful. So long\nas a cyberneticist is sawing and chopping, he's not a sliver of\nuncontaminated cerebrum contemplating the eternal slippery verities of\ngravity and electromagnetism; he's just one more guy trying to slice\nup one more log. Makes him feel he belongs to the human race again.\nEinstein, you know, used to get the same results with a violin.\"\n\nNow, I've heard talk like that before, and I don't like it. I don't\nlike it at all. It so happens that I feel very strongly on the subject.\nI think a scientist should like what he's doing and not want to take\nrefuge in Nature from the Laws of Nature (which is downright illogical,\nanyhow). I, for one, enjoy cutting logs precisely _because_, when my\nsaw rasps across a knot, I know that the innermost secret of that\nknot, as of all matter in the Universe, is E=MC^2. It's my job to\n_know_ it, and it's very satisfying to _know_ that I know it and that\nthe general run of people don't. I was about to put this thought into\nwords, but before I could open my mouth, somebody behind us spoke up.\n\n\"Bravo, Goldie,\" he said. \"Let us by all means pretend that we belong\nto the human race. Make way for the new cyberneticists with their old\nsaws. Cyberneticist, spare that tree!\"\n\nI turned around to see who could be making jokes in such bad taste\nand--as I might have guessed--it was Len Ellsom. He was just as\nsurprised as I was.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"if it isn't Ollie Parks! I thought you were out in\nCal Tech, building schizophrenic bedbugs.\"\n\nAfter M. I. T. I _had_ spent some time out in California doing\nneuro-cyber research, I explained--but what was _he_ doing here? I'd\nlost track of him after he'd left Boston; the last I'd heard, he'd been\nworking on the giant robot brain Remington-Rand was developing for the\nAir Force. I remembered seeing his picture in the paper two or three\ntimes while he was working on the brain.\n\n\"I was with Remington a couple of years,\" he told me. \"If I do say\nso myself, we built the Air Force a real humdinger of a brain--in\naddition to solving the most complex problems in ballistics, it could\nwhistle _Dixie_ and, in moments of stress, produce a sound not unlike\na Bronx cheer. Naturally, for my prowess in the electronic simulation\nof I.Q., I was tapped for the brain department of these hallowed\nprecincts.\"\n\n\"Oh?\" I said. \"Does that mean you're in MS?\" It wasn't an easy idea to\naccept, but I think I was pretty successful in keeping my tone casual.\n\n\"Ollie, my boy,\" he said in an exaggerated stage whisper, putting his\nfinger to his lips, \"in the beginning was the word and the word was\nmum. Leave us avoid the subject of brains in this _keen_ place. We\nall have a job to do on the team.\" I suppose that was meant to be a\nhumorous imitation of the boss; Len always did fancy himself quite a\nclown.\n\nWe were separated during the sawing, but he caught up with me on the\nway back and said, \"Let's get together soon and have a talk, Ollie.\nIt's been a long time.\"\n\nHe wants to talk about Marilyn, I suppose. Naturally. He has a guilty\nconscience. I'll have to make it quite clear to him that the whole\nepisode is a matter of complete indifference to me. Marilyn is a closed\nbook in my life; he must understand that. But can you beat that? He's\nright in the middle of MS! That lad certainly gets around. It's the\nusual Ellsom charm, I suppose.\n\nThe usual Ellsom technique for irritating people, too. He's still\ntrying to get my goat; he knows how much I've always hated to be called\nOllie. Must watch Goldweiser. Thought he laughed pretty heartily at\nLen's wisecracks.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_October 18, 1959_\n\nThings are shaping up in the Pro lab. Here's how I get the picture.\n\nA year ago, the boss laid down a policy for the lab: begin with legs\nbecause, while the neuro-motor systems in legs and arms are a lot\nalike, those in legs are much simpler. If we build satisfactory legs,\nthe boss figures, we can then tackle arms; the main difficulties will\nhave been licked.\n\nWell, last summer, in line with this approach, the Army picked out\na double amputee from the outpatient department of Walter Reed\nHospital--fellow by the name of Kujack, who lost both his legs in a\nland mine explosion outside Pyongyang--and shipped him up here to be a\nsubject in our experiments.\n\nWhen Kujack arrived, the neuro boys made a major decision. It didn't\nmake sense, they agreed, to keep building experimental legs directly\ninto the muscles and nerves of Kujack's stumps; the surgical procedure\nin these cine-plastic jobs is complicated as all getout, involves a\nlot of pain for the subject and, what's more to the point, means long\ndelays each time while the tissues heal.\n\nInstead, they hit on the idea of integrating permanent metal and\nplastic sockets into the stumps, so constructed that each new\nexperimental limb can be snapped into place whenever it's ready for a\ntrial.\n\nBy the time I took over, two weeks ago, Goldweiser had the sockets\nworked out and fitted to Kujack's stumps, and the muscular and\nneural tissues had knitted satisfactorily. There was only one hitch:\ntwenty-three limbs had been designed, and all twenty-three had been\ndismal flops. That's when the boss called me in.\n\nThere's no mystery about the failures. Not to me, anyhow. Cybernetics\nis simply the science of building machines that will duplicate and\nimprove on the organs and functions of the animal, based on what we\nknow about the systems of communication and control in the animal. All\nright. But in any particular cybernetics project, everything depends\non just how _many_ of the functions you want to duplicate, just how\n_much_ of the total organ you want to replace.\n\nThat's why the robot-brain boys can get such quick and spectacular\nresults, have their pictures in the papers all the time, and become\nthe real glamor boys of the profession. They're not asked to duplicate\nthe human brain in its _entirety_--all they have to do is isolate and\nimitate one particular function of the brain, whether it's a simple\noperation in mathematics or a certain type of elementary logic.\n\nThe robot brain called the Eniac, for example, is exactly what its\nname implies--an Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, and\nit just has to be able to integrate and compute figures faster and\nmore accurately than the human brain can. It doesn't have to have\ndaydreams and nightmares, make wisecracks, suffer from anxiety, and\nall that. What's more, it doesn't even have to _look_ like a brain or\nfit into the tiny space occupied by a real brain. It can be housed\nin a six-story building and look like an overgrown typewriter or an\nautomobile dashboard or even a pogo stick. All it has to do is tell you\nthat two times two equals four, and tell you fast.\n\nWhen you're told to build an artificial leg that'll take the place\nof a real one, the headaches begin. Your machine must not only _look_\nlike its living model, it must _also_ balance and support, walk, run,\nhop, skip, jump, etc., etc. _Also_, it must fit into the same space.\n_Also_, it must feel everything a real leg feels--touch, heat, cold,\npain, moisture, kinesthetic sensations--_as well as_ execute all the\nbrain-directed movements that a real leg can.\n\nSo you're not duplicating this or that function; you're reconstructing\nthe organ in its totality, or trying to. Your pro must have a full set\nof sensory-motor communication systems, plus machines to carry out\norders, which is impossible enough to begin with.\n\nBut our job calls for even more. The pro mustn't only _equal_ the\nreal thing, it must be _superior_! That means creating a synthetic\nneuro-muscular system that actually _improves_ on the nerves and\nmuscles Nature created in the original!\n\nWhen our twenty-fourth experimental model turned out to be a dud last\nweek--it just hung from Kujack's stump, quivering like one of my robot\nbedbugs, as though it had a bad case of intention tremor--Goldweiser\nsaid something that made an impression on me.\n\n\"They don't want much from us,\" he said sarcastically. \"They just want\nus to be God.\"\n\nI didn't care for his cynical attitude at all, but he had a point. Len\nEllsom just has to build a fancy adding machine to get his picture in\nthe papers. _I_ have to be God!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_October 22, 1959_\n\nDon't know what to make of Kujack. His attitude is peculiar. Of course,\nhe's very co-operative, lies back on the fitting table and doesn't\neven wince when we snap on the pros, and he does his best to carry out\ninstructions. Still, there's something funny about the way he looks at\nme. There's a kind of malicious expression in his eyes. At times, come\nto think of it, he reminds me of Len.\n\nTake this afternoon, for instance. I've just worked out an entirely\ndifferent kind of leg based on a whole new arrangement of solenoids to\nduplicate the muscle systems, and I decided to give it a try. When I\nwas slipping the model into place, I looked up and caught Kujack's eye\nfor a moment. He seemed to be laughing at something, although his face\nwas expressionless.\n\n\"All right,\" I said. \"Let's make a test. I understand you used to be\nquite a football player. Well, just think of how you used to kick a\nfootball and try to do it now.\"\n\nHe really seemed to be trying; the effort made him sweat. All that\nhappened, though, was that the big toe wriggled a little and the knee\nbuckled. Dud Number Twenty-five. I was sore, of course, especially when\nI noticed that Kujack was more amused than ever.\n\n\"You seem to think something's pretty funny,\" I said.\n\n\"Don't get me wrong, Doc,\" he said, much too innocently. \"It's just\nthat I've been thinking. Maybe you'd have more luck if you thought of\nme as a bedbug.\"\n\n\"Where did you get that idea?\"\n\n\"From Doc Ellsom. I was having some beers with him the other night.\nHe's got a very high opinion of you, says you build the best bedbugs in\nthe business.\"\n\nI find it hard to believe that Len Ellsom would say anything really\nnice about me. Must be his guilt about Marilyn that makes him talk that\nway. I don't like his hanging around Kujack.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_October 25, 1959_\n\nThe boss came along on our woodcutting expedition this morning and\nvolunteered to work the other end of my two-handled saw. He asked how\nthings were coming in the Pro lab.\n\n\"As I see it,\" I said, \"there are two sides to the problem, the\nkinesthetic and the neural. We're making definite progress on the K\nside--I've worked out a new solenoid system, with some miniature motors\ntied in, and I think it'll give us a leg that _moves_ damned well. I\ndon't know about the N side, though. It's pretty tough figuring out\nhow to hook the thing up electrically with the central nervous system\nso that the brain can control it. Some sort of compromise system of\noperation, along mechanical rather than neural lines, would be a lot\nsimpler.\"\n\n\"You mean,\" the boss said with a smile, \"that it's stumping you.\"\n\nI was relieved to see him taking it so well because I know how anxious\nhe is to get results from the Pro lab. Since Pro is one of the few\nthings going on at IFACS that can be talked about, he's impatient for\nus to come up with something he can release to the press. As the public\nrelations officer explained it to me at dinner the other night, people\nget worried when they know there's something like IFACS going, but\ndon't get any real information about it, so the boss, naturally, wants\nto relieve the public's curiosity with a good, reassuring story about\nour work.\n\nI knew I was taking an awful chance spilling the whole K-N thing to him\nthe way I did, but I had to lay the groundwork for a little plan I've\njust begun to work on.\n\n\"By the way, sir,\" I said, \"I ran into Len Ellsom the other day. I\ndidn't know he was here.\"\n\n\"Do you know him?\" the boss said. \"Good man. One of the best\nbrains-and-games men you'll find anywhere.\"\n\nI explained that Len had gotten his degree at M.I.T. the year before I\ndid. From what I'd heard, I added, he'd done some important work on the\nRemington-Rand ballistics computer.\n\n\"He did indeed,\" the boss said, \"but that's not the half of it. After\nthat he made some major contributions to the robot chess player. As a\nmatter of fact, that's why he's here.\"\n\nI said I hadn't heard about the chess player.\n\n\"As soon as it began to play a really good game of chess, Washington\nput the whole thing under wraps for security reasons. Which is why you\nwon't hear any more about it from me.\"\n\nI'm no Eniac, but I can occasionally put two and two together myself.\nIf the boss's remarks mean anything, they mean that an electronic brain\ncapable of playing games has been developed, and that it's led to\nsomething important militarily. Of course! I could kick myself for not\nhaving guessed it before.\n\nBrains-and-games--that's what MS is all about, obviously. It had to\nhappen: out of the mathematical analysis of chess came a robot chess\nplayer, and out of the chess player came some kind of mechanical brain\nthat's useful in military strategy. _That's_ what Len Ellsom's in the\nmiddle of.\n\n\"Really brilliant mind,\" the boss said after we'd sawed for a while.\n\"Keen. But he's a little erratic--quirky, queer sense of humor. Isn't\nthat your impression?\"\n\n\"Definitely,\" I said. \"I'd be the last one in the world to say a word\nagainst Len, but he was always a little peculiar. Very gay one moment\nand very sour the next, and inclined to poke fun at things other people\ntake seriously. He used to write poetry.\"\n\n\"I'm very glad to know that,\" the boss said. \"Confirms my own feeling\nabout him.\"\n\nSo the boss has some doubts about Len.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_October 27, 1959_\n\nUnpleasant evening with Len. It all started after dinner when he showed\nup in my room, wagged his finger at me and said, \"Ollie, you've been\navoiding me. That hurts. Thought we were pals, thick and thin and till\ndebt and death do us part.\"\n\nI saw immediately that he was drunk--he always gets his words mixed\nup when he's drunk--and I tried to placate him by explaining that it\nwasn't anything like that; I'd been busy.\n\n\"If we're pals,\" he said, \"come on and have a beer with me.\"\n\nThere was no shaking him off, so I followed him down to his car and we\ndrove to this sleazy little bar in the Negro part of town. As soon as\nwe sat down in a booth, Len borrowed all the nickels I had, put them\nin the jukebox and pressed the levers for a lot of old Louie Armstrong\nrecords.\n\n\"Sorry, kid,\" he said. \"I know how you hate this real jazzy stuff, but\ncan't have a reunion without music, and there isn't a polka or cowboy\nballad or hillbilly stomp in the box. They lack the folksy touch on\nthis side of the tracks.\" Len has always been very snobbish about my\ninterest in folk music.\n\nI asked him what he'd been doing during the day.\n\n\"Lushing it up,\" he said. \"Getting stinking from drinking.\" He still\nlikes to use the most flamboyant slang; I consider it an infantile form\nof protest against what he regards as the \"genteel\" manner of academic\npeople. \"I got sort of restless this morning, so I ducked out and beat\nit into New York and looked up my friend Steve Lundy in the Village.\nSpent the afternoon liquidating our joint assets. Liquidating our\nassets in the joints.\"\n\nWhat, I wanted to know, was he feeling restless about?\n\n\"Restless for going on three years now.\" His face grew solemn, as\nthough he were thinking it over very carefully. \"I'll amend that\nstatement. Hell with the Aesopian language. I've been a plain lush for\ngoing on three years. Ever since--\"\n\nIf it was something personal--I suggested.\n\n\"It is _not_ something personal,\" he said, mimicking me. \"Guess I can\ntell an old cyberneticist pal about it. Been a lush for three years\nbecause I've been scared for three years. Been scared for three years\nbecause three years ago I saw a machine beat a man at a game of chess.\"\n\nA machine that plays chess? That was interesting, I said.\n\n\"Didn't tell you the whole truth the other day,\" Len mumbled. \"I _did_\nwork on the Remington-Rand computer, sure, but I didn't come to IFACS\ndirectly from that. In between I spent a couple years at the Bell\nTelephone Labs. Claude Shannon--or, rather, to begin with there was\nNorbert Wiener back at M.I.T.--it's complicated....\"\n\n\"Look,\" I said, \"are you sure you want to talk about it?\"\n\n\"Stop wearing your loyalty oath on your sleeve,\" he said belligerently.\n\"Sure I want to talk about it. Greatest subject I know. Begin at\nthe beginning. Whole thing started back in the Thirties with those\ntwo refugee mathematicians who used to be here at the Institute for\nAdvanced Studies when Einstein was around. Von Morgan and Neumanstern,\nno, Von _Neu_mann and _Mor_ganstern. You remember, they did a\nmathematical analysis of all the possible kinds of games, poker,\ntossing pennies, chess, bridge, everything, and they wrote up their\nfindings in a volume you certainly know, _The Theory of Games_.\n\n\"Well, that got Wiener started. You may remember that when he founded\nthe science of cybernetics, he announced that on the basis of the\ntheory of games, it was feasible to design a robot computing machine\nthat would play a better than average game of chess. Right after that,\nback in '49 or maybe it was '50, Claude Shannon of the Bell Labs said\nWiener wasn't just talking, and to prove it he was going to _build_\nthe robot chess player. Which he proceeded withforth--forthwith--to\ndo. Sometime in '53, I was taken off the Remington-Rand project and\nassigned to Bell to work with him.\"\n\n\"Maybe we ought to start back,\" I cut in. \"I've got a lot of work to\ndo.\"\n\n\"The night is young,\" he said, \"and you're so dutiful. Where was I? Oh\nyes, Bell. At first our electronic pawn-pusher wasn't so hot--it could\nbeat the pants off a lousy player, but an expert just made it look\nsilly. But we kept improving it, see, building more and more electronic\nanticipation and gambit-plotting powers into it, and finally, one great\nday in '55, we thought we had all the kinks ironed out and were ready\nfor the big test. By this time, of course, Washington had stepped in\nand taken over the whole project.\n\n\"Well, we got hold of Fortunescu, the world's champion chess player,\nsat him down and turned the robot loose on him. For four hours straight\nwe followed the match, with a delegation of big brass from Washington,\nand for four hours straight the machine trounced Fortunescu every game.\nThat was when I began to get scared. I went out that night and got\nreally loaded.\"\n\nWhat had he been so scared about? It seemed to me he should have felt\nhappy.\n\n\"Listen, Ollie,\" he said, \"for Christ's sake, stop talking like a Boy\nScout for once in your life.\"\n\nIf he was going to insult me--\n\n\"No insult intended. Just listen. I'm a terrible chess player. Any\nfive-year-old could chatemeck--checkmate--me with his brains tied\nbehind his back. But this machine which I built, helped build, is the\nchampion chess player of the world. In other words, my brain has given\nbirth to a brain which can do things my brain could never do. Don't you\nfind that terrifying?\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" I said. \"_You_ made the machine, didn't you? Therefore,\nno matter what it does, it's only an extension of you. You should feel\nproud to have devised a powerful new tool.\"\n\n\"Some tool,\" he sneered. He was so drunk by now that I could hardly\nunderstand what he was saying. \"The General Staff boys in Washington\nwere all hopped up about that little old tool, and for a plenty good\nreason--they understood that mechanized warfare is only the most\ncomplicated game the human race has invented so far, an elaborate form\nof chess which uses the population of the world for pawns and the\nglobe for a chessboard. They saw, too, that when the game of war gets\nthis complex, the job of controlling and guiding it becomes too damned\ninvolved for any number of human brains, no matter how nimble.\n\n\"In other words, my beamish Boy Scout, modern war needs just this kind\nof strategy tool; the General Staff has to be mechanized along with\neverything else. So the Pentagon boys set up IFACS and handed us a\ntop-priority cybernetics project: to build a superduper chess player\nthat could oversee a complicated military maneuver, maybe later a whole\ncampaign, maybe ultimately a whole global war.\n\n\"We're aiming at a military strategy machine which can digest reports\nfrom all the units on all the fronts and from moment to moment, on\nthe basis of that steady stream of information, grind out an elastic\noverall strategy and dictate concrete tactical directives to all the\nunits. Wiener warned this might happen, and he was right. A very nifty\ntool. Never mind how far we've gotten with the thing, but I will tell\nyou this: I'm a lot more scared today than I was three years ago.\"\n\nSo _that_ was the secret of MS! The most extraordinary machine ever\ndevised by the human mind! It was hard to conceal the thrill of\nexcitement I felt, even as a relative outsider.\n\n\"Why all the jitters?\" I said. \"This could be the most wonderful tool\never invented. It might eliminate war altogether.\"\n\nLen was quiet for a while, gulping his beer and looking off into space.\nThen he turned to me.\n\n\"Steve Lundy has a cute idea,\" he said. \"He was telling me about it\nthis afternoon. He's a bum, you see, but he's got a damned good mind\nand he's done a lot of reading. Among other things, he's smart enough\nto see that once you've got your theory of games worked out, there's\nat least the logical possibility of converting your Eniac into what\nhe calls a Strategy Integrator and Computer. And he's guessed, simply\nfrom the Pentagon's hush-hush policy about it, that that's what we're\nworking on here at IFACS. So he holds forth on the subject of Emsiac,\nand I listen.\"\n\n\"What's his idea?\" I asked.\n\n\"He thinks Emsiac might eliminate war, too, but not in the way a\nBoy Scout might think. What he says is that all the industrialized\nnations must be working away like mad on Emsiac, just as they did on\nthe atom bomb, so let's assume that before long all the big countries\nwill have more or less equal MS machines. All right. A cold war gets\nunder way between countries A and B, and pretty soon it reaches the\nshowdown stage. Then both countries plug in their Emsiacs and let them\ncalculate the date on which hostilities should begin. If the machines\nare equally efficient, they'll hit on the same date. If there's a\nslight discrepancy, the two countries can work out a compromise date by\nnegotiation.\n\n\"The day arrives. A's Emsiac is set up in its capital, B's is set up\nin _its_ capital. In each capital the citizens gather around their\nstrategy machine, the officials turn out in high hats and cut-aways,\nthere are speeches, pageants, choral singing, mass dancing--the ritual\ncan be worked out in advance. Then, at an agreed time, the crowds\nretreat to a safe distance and a committee of the top cyberneticists\nappears. They climb into planes, take off and--this is beautiful--drop\nall their atom bombs and H-bombs on the machines. It happens\nsimultaneously in both countries, you see. That's the neat part of it.\nThe occasion is called International Mushroom Day.\n\n\"Then the cyberneticists in both countries go back to their vacuum\ntubes to work on another Emsiac, and the nuclear physicists go back to\ntheir piles to build more atom bombs, and when they're ready they have\nanother Mushroom Day. One Mushroom Day every few years, whenever the\ndiplomatic-strategic situation calls for it, and nobody even fires a\nB-B gun. Scientific war. Isn't it wonderful?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBy the time Len finished this peculiar speech, I'd finally managed to\nget him out of the tavern and back into his car. I started to drive him\nback to the Institute, my ears still vibrating with the hysterical\nyelps of Armstrong's trumpet. I'll never for the life of me understand\nwhat Len sees in that kind of music. It seems to me such an unhealthy\nsort of expression.\n\n\"Lundy's being plain silly,\" I couldn't help saying. \"What guarantee\nhas he got that on your Mushroom Day, Country B wouldn't make a great\ndisplay of destroying one Emsiac and one set of bombs while it had\nothers in hiding? It's too great a chance for A to take--she might be\nthrowing away all her defenses and laying herself wide open to attack.\"\n\n\"See what I mean?\" Len muttered. \"You're a Boy Scout.\" Then he passed\nout, without saying a word about Marilyn. Hard to tell if he sees\nanything of her these days. He _does_ see some pretty peculiar people,\nthough. I'd like to know more about this Steve Lundy.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_November 2, 1959_\n\nI've done it! Today I split up the lab into two entirely independent\noperations, K and N. Did it all on my own authority, haven't breathed a\nword about it to the boss yet. Here's my line of reasoning.\n\nOn the K end, we can get results, and fast: if it's just a matter\nof building a pro that works like the real leg, regardless of what\n_makes_ it work, it's a cinch. But if it has to be worked by the\nbrain, through the spinal cord, the job is just about impossible. Who\nknows if we'll ever learn enough about neuro tissue to build our own\nphysico-chemico-electrical substitutes for it?\n\nAs I proved in my robot moths and bedbugs, I can work up electronic\ncircuits that seem to duplicate one particular function of animal\nnerve tissue--one robot is attracted to light like a moth, the other\nis repelled by light like a bedbug--but I don't know how to go about\nduplicating the tissue itself in all its functions. And until we can\nduplicate nerve tissue, there's no way to provide our artificial limbs\nwith a neuro-motor system that can be hooked up with the central\nnervous system. The best I can do along those lines is ask Kujack to\nkick and get a wriggle of the big toe instead.\n\nSo the perspective is clear. Mechanically, kinesthetically,\nmotorically, I can manufacture a hell of a fine leg. Neurally, it would\ntake decades, centuries maybe, to get even a reasonable facsimile of\nthe original--and maybe it will never happen. It's not a project I'd\ncare to devote my life to. If Len Ellsom had been working on that sort\nof thing, he wouldn't have gotten his picture in the paper so often,\nyou can be sure.\n\nSo, in line with this perspective, I've divided the whole operation\ninto two separate labs, K-Pro and N-Pro. I'm taking charge of K-Pro\nmyself, since it intrigues me more and I've got these ideas about\nusing solenoids to get lifelike movements. With any kind of luck I'll\nsoon have a peach of a mechanical limb, motor-driven and with its own\nbuilt-in power plant, operated by push-button. Before Christmas, I hope.\n\nGot just the right man to take over the neuro lab--Goldweiser, my\nassistant. I weighed the thing from every angle before I made up my\nmind, since his being Jewish makes the situation very touchy: some\npeople will be snide enough to say I picked him to be a potential\nscapegoat. Well, Goldweiser, no matter what his origins may be, is the\nbest neuro man I know.\n\nOf course, personally--although my personal feelings don't enter into\nthe picture at all--I _am_ just a bit leery of the fellow. Have been\never since that first log-cutting expedition, when he began to talk in\nsuch a peculiar way about needing to relax and then laughed so hard\nat Len's jokes. That sort of talk always indicates to me a lack of\nreverence for your job: if a thing's worth doing at all, etc.\n\nOf course, I don't mean that Goldweiser's cynical attitude has anything\nto do with his being Jewish; Len's got the same attitude and he's\n_not_ Jewish. Still, this afternoon, when I told Goldweiser he's going\nto head up the N-Pro lab, he sort of bowed and said, \"That's quite a\npromotion. I always did want to be God.\"\n\nI didn't like that remark at all. If I'd had another neuro man as good\nas he is, I'd have withdrawn the promotion immediately. It's his luck\nthat I'm tolerant, that's all.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_November 6, 1959_\n\nLunch with Len today, at my invitation. Bought him several Martinis,\nthen brought up Lundy's name and asked who he was, he sounded\ninteresting.\n\n\"Steve?\" Len said. \"I roomed with him my first year in New York.\"\n\nI asked what Steve did, exactly.\n\n\"Reads, mostly. He got into the habit back in the 30s, when he was\nstudying philosophy at the University of Chicago. When the Civil War\nbroke out in Spain, he signed up with the Lincoln Brigade and went over\nthere to fight, but it turned out to be a bad mistake. His reading got\nhim in a lot of trouble, you see; he'd gotten used to asking all sorts\nof questions, so when the Moscow Trials came along, he asked about\nthem. Then the N.K.V.D. began to pop up all over Spain, and he asked\nabout it.\n\n\"His comrades, he discovered, didn't like guys who kept asking\nquestions. In fact, a couple of Steve's friends who had also had an\ninquiring streak were found dead at the front, shot in the _back_,\nand Steve got the idea that he was slated for the same treatment.\nIt seemed that people who asked questions were called saboteurs,\nTrotskyite-Fascists or something, and they kept dying at an alarming\nrate.\"\n\nI ordered another Martini for Len and asked how Steve had managed to\nsave himself.\n\n\"He beat it across the mountains into France,\" Len explained. \"Since\nthen he's steered clear of causes. He goes to sea once in a while\nto make a few bucks, drinks a lot, reads a lot, asks some of the\nshrewdest questions I know. If he's anything you can put a label on,\nI'd say he was a touch of Rousseau, a touch of Tolstoi, plenty of\nVoltaire. Come to think of it, a touch of Norbert Wiener too. Wiener,\nyou may remember, used to ask some damned iconoclastic questions for a\ncyberneticist. Steve knows Wiener's books by heart.\"\n\nSteve sounded like a very colorful fellow, I suggested.\n\n\"Yep,\" Len said. \"Marilyn used to think so.\" I don't think I moved a\nmuscle when he said it; the smile didn't leave my face. \"Ollie,\" Len\nwent on, \"I've been meaning to speak to you about Marilyn. Now that the\nsubject's come up--\"\n\n\"I've forgotten all about it,\" I assured him.\n\n\"I still want to set you straight,\" he insisted. \"It must have looked\nfunny, me moving down to New York after commencement and Marilyn giving\nup her job in the lab and following two days later. But never mind\n_how_ it looked. I never made a pass at her all that time in Boston,\nOllie. That's the truth. But she was a screwy, scatter-brained dame and\nshe decided she was stuck on me because I dabbled in poetry and hung\naround with artists and such in the Village, and she thought it was all\nso glamorous. I didn't have anything to do with her chasing down to New\nYork, no kidding. You two were sort of engaged, weren't you?\"\n\n\"It really doesn't matter,\" I said. \"You don't have to explain.\" I\nfinished my drink. \"You say she knew Lundy?\"\n\n\"Sure, she knew Lundy. She also knew Kram, Rossard, Broyold, Boster, De\nKroot and Hayre. She knew a whole lot of guys before she was through.\"\n\n\"She always was sociable.\"\n\n\"You don't get my meaning,\" Len said. \"I am not talking about Marilyn's\ngregarious impulses. Listen. First she threw herself at me, but I got\ntired of her. Then she threw herself at Steve and _he_ got tired of\nher. Damn near the whole male population of the Village got tired of\nher in the next couple years.\"\n\n\"Those were troubled times. The war and all.\"\n\n\"They were troubled times,\" Len agreed, \"and she was the source of\na fair amount of the trouble. You were well rid of her, Ollie, take\nmy word for it. God save us from the intense Boston female who goes\nbohemian--the icicle parading as the torch.\"\n\n\"Just as a matter of academic curiosity,\" I said as we were leaving,\n\"what became of her?\"\n\n\"I don't know for sure. During her Village phase she decided her\ncreative urge was hampered by compasses and T-squares, and in\nbetween men she tried to do a bit of painting--very abstract, very\nimitative-original, very hammy. I heard later that she finally gave up\nthe self-expression kick, moved up to the East Seventies somewhere. If\nI remember, she got a job doing circuit designing on some project for\nI.B.M.\"\n\n\"She's probably doing well at it,\" I said. \"She certainly knew her\ndrafting. You know, she helped lay out the circuits for the first robot\nbedbug I ever built.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_November 19, 1959_\n\nBig step forward, if it isn't unseemly to use a phrase like that in\nconnection with Pro research. This afternoon we completed the first\ntwo experimental models of my self-propelled solenoid legs, made of\ntransparent plastic so everything is visible--solenoids, batteries,\nmotors, thyratron tubes and transistors.\n\nKujack was waiting in the fitting room to give them their first tryout,\nbut when I got there I found Len sitting with him. There were several\nempty beer cans on the floor and they were gabbing away a mile a minute.\n\nLen _knows_ how I hate to see people drinking during working hours.\nWhen I put the pros down and began to rig them for fitting, he said\nconspiratorially, \"Shall we tell him?\"\n\nKujack was pretty crocked, too. \"Let's tell him,\" he whispered back.\nStrange thing about Kujack, he hardly ever says a word to me, but he\nnever closes his mouth when Len's around.\n\n\"All right,\" Len said. \"_You_ tell him. Tell him how we're going to\nbring peace on Earth and good will toward bedbugs.\"\n\n\"We just figured it out,\" Kujack said. \"What's wrong with war. It's a\nsteamroller.\"\n\n\"Steamrollers are very undemocratic,\" Len added. \"Never consult people\non how they like to be flattened before flattening them. They just go\nrolling along.\"\n\n\"Just go rolling, they go on rolling along,\" Kujack said. \"Like Old Man\nRiver.\"\n\n\"What's the upshot?\" Len demanded. \"People get upshot, shot up. In all\ncountries, all of them without exception, they emerge from the war\nspiritually flattened, a little closer to the insects--like the hero in\nthat Kafka story who wakes up one morning to find he's a bedbug, I mean\nbeetle. All because they've been steamrolled. Nobody consulted them.\"\n\n\"Take the case of an amputee,\" Kujack said. \"Before the land mine\nexploded, it didn't stop and say, 'Look, friend, I've got to go off;\nthat's my job. Choose which part you'd prefer to have blown off--arm,\nleg, ear, nose, or what-have-you. Or is there somebody else around who\nwould relish being clipped more than you would? If so, just send him\nalong. I've got to do some clipping, you see, but it doesn't matter\nmuch which part of which guy I clip, so long as I make my quota.' Did\nthe land mine say that? No! The victim wasn't consulted. Consequently\nhe can feel victimized, full of self-pity. We just worked it out.\"\n\n\"The whole thing,\" Len said. \"If the population had been polled\naccording to democratic procedure, the paraplegia and other maimings\ncould have been distributed to each according to his psychological\nneed. See the point? Marx corrected by Freud, as Steve Lundy would\nsay. Distribute the injuries to each according to his need--not his\neconomic need, but his masochistic need. Those with a special taste\nfor self-damage obviously should be allowed a lion's share of it. That\nway nobody could claim he'd been victimized by the steamroller or got\nanything he didn't ask for. It's all on a voluntary basis, you see.\nDemocratic.\"\n\n\"Whole new concept of war,\" Kujack agreed. \"Voluntary amputeeism,\nvoluntary paraplegia, voluntary everything else that usually happens to\npeople in a war. Just to get some human dignity back into the thing.\"\n\n\"Here's how it works,\" Len went on. \"Country A and Country B reach the\nbreaking point. It's all over but the shooting. All right. So they pool\ntheir best brains, mathematicians, actuaries, strategists, logistics\ngeniuses, and all. What am I saying? They pool their best _robot_\nbrains, their Emsiacs. In a matter of seconds they figure out, down\nto the last decimal point, just how many casualties each side can be\nexpected to suffer in dead and wounded, and then they break down the\nfigures. Of the wounded, they determine just how many will lose eyes,\nhow many arms, how many legs, and so on down the line. Now--here's\nwhere it gets really neat--each country, having established its\nquotas in dead and wounded of all categories, can send out a call for\nvolunteers.\"\n\n\"Less messy that way,\" Kujack said. \"An efficiency expert's war. War on\nan actuarial basis.\"\n\n\"You get exactly the same results as in a shooting war,\" Len insisted.\n\"Just as many dead, wounded and psychologically messed up. But you\navoid the whole steamroller effect. A tidy war, war with dispatch,\nconceived in terms of ends rather than means. The end never did justify\nthe means, you see; Steve Lundy says that was always the great dilemma\nof politics. So with one fool sweep--fell swoop--we get rid of means\nentirely.\"\n\n\"As things stand with me,\" Kujack said, \"if _anything_ stands with me,\nI might get to feeling sore about what happened to me. But nothing\nhappens _to_ the volunteer amputee. He steps up to the operating\ntable and says, 'Just chop off one arm, Doc, the left one, please,\nup to the elbow if you don't mind, and in return put me down for\none-and-two-thirds free meals daily at Longchamps and a plump blonde\nevery Saturday.'\"\n\n\"Or whatever the exchange value for one slightly used left arm would\nbe,\" Len amended. \"That would have to be worked out by the robot\nactuaries.\"\n\nBy this time I had the pros fitted and the push-button controls\ninstalled in the side pocket of Kujack's jacket.\n\n\"Maybe you'd better go now, Len,\" I said. I was very careful to show no\nreaction to his baiting. \"Kujack and I have some work to do.\"\n\n\"I hope you'll make him a moth instead of a bedbug,\" Len said as he got\nup. \"Kujack's just beginning to see the light. Be a shame if you give\nhim a negative tropism to it instead of a positive one.\" He turned to\nKujack, wobbling a little. \"So long, kid. I'll pick you up at seven and\nwe'll drive into New York to have a few with Steve. He's going to be\nvery happy to hear we've got the whole thing figured out.\"\n\nI spent two hours with Kujack, getting him used to the extremely\ndelicate push-button controls. I must say that, drunk or sober,\nhe's a very apt pupil. In less than two hours he actually walked! A\nlittle unsteadily, to be sure, but his balance will get better as he\npractices and I iron out a few more bugs, and I _don't_ mean bedbugs.\n\nFor a final test, I put a little egg cup on the floor, balanced a\nfootball in it, and told Kujack to try a place kick. What a moment! He\nbooted that ball so hard, it splintered the mirror on the wall.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_November 27, 1959_\n\nLong talk with the boss. I gave it to him straight about breaking up\nthe lab into K-Pro and N-Pro, and about there being little chance that\nGoldweiser would come up with anything much on the neuro end for a\nlong, long time. He was awfully let down, I could see, so I started to\ntalk fast about the luck I'd been having on the kinesthetic end. When\nhe began to perk up, I called Kujack in from the corridor and had him\ndemonstrate his place kick.\n\nHe's gotten awfully good at it this past week.\n\n\"If we release the story to the press,\" I suggested, \"this might make\na fine action shot. You see, Kujack used to be one of the best kickers\nin the Big Ten, and a lot of newspapermen will still remember him.\"\nThen I sprang the biggest news of all. \"During the last three days of\npractice, sir, he's been consistently kicking the ball twenty, thirty\nand even forty yards farther than he ever did with his own legs. Than\nanybody, as a matter of fact, ever has with real legs.\"\n\n\"That's a wonderful angle,\" the boss said excitedly. \"A world's record,\nmade with a cybernetic leg!\"\n\n\"It should make a terrific picture,\" Kujack said. \"I've also been\npracticing a big, broad, photogenic grin.\" Luckily the boss didn't hear\nhim--by this time he was bending over the legs, studying the solenoids.\n\nAfter Kujack left, the boss congratulated me. Very, _very_ warmly. It\nwas a most gratifying moment. We chatted for a while, making plans for\nthe press conference, and then finally he said, \"By the way, do you\nhappen to know anything about your friend Ellsom? I'm worried about\nhim. He went off on Thanksgiving and hasn't been heard from at all ever\nsince.\"\n\nThat was alarming, I said. When the boss asked why, I told him a\nlittle about how Len had been acting lately, talking and drinking more\nthan was good for him. With all sorts of people. The boss said that\nconfirmed his own impressions.\n\nI can safely say we understood each other. I sensed a very definite\nrapport.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_November 30, 1959_\n\nIt was bound to happen, of course. As I got it from the boss, he\ndecided after our talk that Len's absence needed some looking into, and\nhe tipped off Security about it. A half dozen agents went to work on\nthe case and right off they headed for Steve Lundy's apartment in the\nVillage and, sure enough, there was Len.\n\nLen and his friend were both blind drunk and there were all sorts of\nincriminating things in the room--lots of peculiar books and pamphlets,\nLundy's identification papers from the Lincoln Brigade, an article\nLundy was writing for an anarchist-pacifist magazine about what he\ncalls Emsiac. Len and his friend were both arrested on the spot and a\nfull investigation is going on now.\n\nThe boss says that no matter whether Len is brought to trial or not,\nhe's all washed up. He'll never get a job on any classified cybernetics\nproject from now on, because it's clear enough that he violated his\nloyalty oath by discussing MS all over the place.\n\nThe Security men came around to question me this morning. Afraid my\ntestimony didn't help Len's case any. What could I do? I had to own up\nthat, to my knowledge, Len had violated Security on three counts: he'd\ndiscussed MS matters with Kujack in my presence, with Lundy (according\nto what he told me), and of course with me (I am technically an\noutsider, too). I also pointed out that I'd tried to make him shut up,\nbut there was no stopping him once he got going. Damn that Len, anyhow.\nWhy does he have to go and put me in this ethical spot? It shows a lack\nof consideration.\n\nThese Security men can be _too_ thorough. Right off they wanted to pick\nup Kujack as well.\n\nI got hold of the boss and explained that if they took Kujack away we'd\nhave to call off our press conference, because it would take months to\nfit and train another subject.\n\nThe boss immediately saw the injustice of the thing, stepped in and got\nSecurity to calm down, at least until we finish our demonstration.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_December 23, 1959_\n\nWhat a day! The press conference this afternoon was _something_. Dozens\nof reporters and photographers and newsreel men showed up, and we took\nthem all out to the football field for the demonstrations. First the\nboss gave a little orientation talk about cybernetics being teamwork in\nscience, and about the difference between K-Pro and N-Pro, pointing\nout that from the practical, humanitarian angle of helping the amputee,\nK is a lot more important than N.\n\nThe reporters tried to get in some questions about MS, but he parried\nthem very good-humoredly, and he said some nice things about me, some\nvery nice things indeed.\n\nThen Kujack was brought in. He really went through his paces, walking,\nrunning, skipping, jumping and everything. It was damned impressive.\nAnd then, to top off the show, Kujack place-kicked a football\nninety-three yards by actual measurement, a world's record, and\neverybody went wild.\n\nAfterward Kujack and I posed for the newsreels, shaking hands while the\nboss stood with his arms around us. They're going to play the whole\nthing up as IFACS' Christmas present to one of our gallant war heroes\n(just what the boss wanted: he figures this sort of things makes IFACS\nsound so much less grim to the public), and Kujack was asked to say\nsomething in line with that idea.\n\n\"I never could kick this good with my real legs,\" he said, holding my\nhand tight and looking straight at me. \"Gosh, this is just about the\nnicest Christmas present a fellow could get. Thank you, Santa.\"\n\nI thought he was overdoing it a bit toward the end there, but the\nnewsreel men say they think it's a great sentimental touch.\n\nGoldweiser was in the crowd, and he said, \"I only hope that when _I_\nprove I'm God, this many photographers will show up.\" That's just about\nthe kind of remark I'd expect from Goldweiser.\n\nToo bad the Security men are coming for Kujack tomorrow. The boss\ncouldn't argue. After all, they were patient enough to wait until after\nthe tests and demonstration, which the boss and I agree was white of\nthem. It's not as if Kujack isn't deeply involved in this Ellsom-Lundy\ncase. As the boss says, you can tell a man by the company, etc.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_December 25, 1959_\n\nSpent the morning clipping pictures and articles from the papers; they\ngave us _quite_ a spread. Late in the afternoon I went over to the\nboss's house for eggnogs, and I finally got up the nerve to say what's\nbeen on my mind for over a month now. Strike while the iron's, etc.\n\n\"I've been thinking, sir,\" I said, \"that this solenoid system I've\nworked out for Pros has other applications. For example, it could\neasily be adapted to some of the tricky mechanical aspects of an\nelectronic calculator.\" I went into some of the technical details\nbriefly, and I could see he was interested. \"I'd like very much to work\non that, now that K-Pro is licked, more or less. And if there _is_ an\nopening in MS--\"\n\n\"You're a go-getter,\" the boss said, nodding in a pleased way. He was\nlooking at a newspaper lying on the coffee table; on the front page was\na large picture of Kujack grinning at me and shaking my hand. \"I like\nthat. I can't promise anything, but let me think about it.\"\n\nI think I'm in!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_December 27, 1959_\n\nSent the soup-and-fish out be cleaned and pressed. Looks like I'm going\nto get some use out of it, after all. We're having a big formal New\nYear's Eve party in the commons room and there's going to be square\ndancing, swing-your-partner, and all of that. When I called Marilyn,\nshe sounded very friendly--she remembered to call me Oliver, and I was\nflattered that she did--and said she'd be delighted to come. Seems\nshe's gotten very fond of folk dancing lately.\n\nGosh, it'll be good to get out of these dungarees for a while. I'm\nhappy to say I still look good in formals. Marilyn ought to be quite\nimpressed. Len always wore his like pajamas.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Self Portrait, by Bernard Wolfe\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK SELF PORTRAIT ***\n\n***** This file should be named 51534.txt or 51534.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/1/5/3/51534/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations.

The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Newby\n    Chief Executive and Director\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
