Beat the drums!\n Shout hosannas! Here he comes...._\n\n\nCELEBRITY\n\nBy James McKimmey, Jr.\n\nIllustrated by PAUL ORBAN\n\n\nJune 19, 1978. Celebrity day.\n\nThe city stretched. Empty streets glistened from the bath of a water\ntruck. Dew-wet grass winked at the fresh peeping sun, like millions of\nshimmering diamonds. A bird chirped. Another. The city yawned.\n\nRows of houses lay like square ivory beads on patches of green felt. A\nboy drove his bicycle down the middle of an elm-bordered avenue,\nwhistling loudly, while tightly rolled newspapers arced from his hand\nand slapped against porches.\n\nLights snapped on in a thousand windows, shining yellowly against the\ncool whiteness of dawn. Men blinked and touched beard-stubbled chins.\nWomen moved sleepily toward porcelain and chrome kitchens.\n\nA truck roared and garbage pails rattled. There was a smell of sour\norange rinds and wet leaves and unfolding flowers. Over this came the\nsmell of toasting bread and frying bacon.\n\nDoors swung open, slippered feet padded across porches and hands groped\nfor the rolled newspapers. The air was stricken with the blaring sound\nof transcribed music and the excited voices of commercial announcers.\nThe doors swung shut and the sounds were muted.\n\nA million people shifted and stretched and scratched. The sun rose above\nthe horizon.\n\nCelebrity day.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDoors slammed again, and half-consumed cups of coffee lay cooling\nbehind. Children wiped at sleepy eyes and mothers swept crumbs, touching\nself-conscious fingers at their own bed-ruffled hair. Laborers and\nclerks and lawyers and doctors strode down sidewalks and climbed into\nautomobiles and busses and sleek-nosed elevated trains. The city moved.\n\nTo the center of the city, where the tall buildings stretched to the\nlighting sky, came the horde, like thousands of ants toward a comb of\nhoney. Wheels sang and whined. Horns blasted. Whistles blew.\n\nAnd waiting, strung above the wide streets between the cold marquees and\nthe dead neon tubes, were the banners and the flags and the bunting.\n\nThe air warmed and the sun brightened. Voices chattered. Elbows nudged.\nMouths smiled, teeth shone, and there was the sound of laughter, rising\nover the pushing throngs. The city was happy.\n\nThe bunting dipped and the banners fluttered and the flags whipped. At\nthe edge of the city, the airport tightened itself. Waiting, waiting for\nthe silver and blue rocket. The rocket of the Celebrity.\n\nA large hotel, towering above the pulsing streets, began the quiver of\nactivity. As though a great electric current had been run through its\ncubes and shafts and hollows, the hotel crackled. Desk clerks clicked\nbells and bell boys hopped. Elevators rose and fell. In the cellar, wine\nbottles were dusted by quick, nervous hands. In the kitchen, a towering\ncake was frosted and decorated. Orders cracked. Hands flew and feet\nchattered against tile. In one rich expansive suite a giant hoop of\nmulti-colored flowers was placed in the center of a room.\n\nIt was in the air. Laughter, awe, worship, _excitement_!\n\nRopes went up and stretched between lamp posts. Blue-coated men on\nhorses began blocking streets. Old women with wooden boxes, children\nwith flashing eyes, men in rich suits and tattered suits began filling\nthe sidewalks.\n\nCurbs became lined with people. Bars threw open doors and fresh air met\nstale air. Men with fat faces, thin faces, white faces, red faces,\ntwitching with the anticipation of holiday freedom, gulped jiggers of\nraw whiskey and shuddered happily.\n\nChildren giggled and yelled and sprinted in crazy zig-zags. Men in white\ncaps hustled in front of the lined curbs, shouting, carrying their boxes\nof ice-cream. Men with buttons, men with pennants, men with balloons\njoined the shouting, and the sound rose in the air and the city smiled\nand shifted and its heart pounded.\n\nThe hotel whirred inside itself. The airport tensed and searched the\nsky.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTime moved and the swelling throngs jammed the sidewalks, raising their\nstrengthening sound between the tall buildings. Windows popped open and\nfaces beamed. Tentative showers of confetti drifted down through the\nair.\n\nThe city waited, its pulse thumping.\n\nThe rocket was a black point in the sky. It grew. White-suited men\nscattered over the landing strip. Photographers crouched. Bulbs snapped\ninto reflectors. Cameras pointed.\n\nThe rocket landed. A door snapped open. Blue uniforms converged and\nflash bulbs popped. There were shouts and orders and men running. Gates\nswung and there was a blue-rimmed movement to a black open car. Sirens\nmoaned, screamed. And the black car was moving swiftly into the city.\n\nBeneath the buildings, marching bands in red and blue and yellow\nuniforms stood assembled. Girls in short skirts and tasseled hats spun\nsilver batons into the warm air. Bare legs kicked. Black boots flashed.\n\nThe crowd swayed against the ropes, and there was laughter and sweating\nand squinting.\n\nThe black car reached the heart of the city. Sirens died. Rows of men\nsnapped to attention. Policemen aligned their motorcycles.\n\nA baton shimmered high against the sun and came down.\n\nA cymbal crashed. Drums cracked. Music blared. And there was a movement\ndown the street.\n\nThe black car rolled along, while tape swept down from the buildings in\nlong swirling ribbons. There was a snow of confetti. And from the\nthroats of the people came the first roar. It grew, building, building\nin volume, and the city thundered its welcome to the man sitting upon\nthe back of the open car, the small man who tipped his hat and smiled\nand blinked behind his glasses: Joseph S. Stettison, B.A., B.S., M.S.,\nM.D., Ph.D., L.M. (Hon.), F.R.C.O.G.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _If Worlds of Science Fiction_ July\n    1953.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
