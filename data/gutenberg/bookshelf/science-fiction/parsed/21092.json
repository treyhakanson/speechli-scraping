Space Academy first stop!\nPassengers for Space Academy will please take seats in the first six\ncars!\"\n\nAs the crowd of people waiting in the concourse surged through the gate\nleading to Track Seven, three boys in the royal-blue uniforms of the\nSpace Cadet Corps slowly picked up their plastic space bags and joined\nthe mass of travelers.\n\nWearily, they drifted with the crowd and stepped on the slidestairs\nleading down to the monorail platform. In the lead, Tom Corbett, the\ncommand cadet of the unit, a tall, curly-haired boy of eighteen,\nslouched against the handrail and looked back at his two unit-mates,\nRoger Manning and Astro. Manning, a slender cadet, with close-cropped\nblond hair, was yawning and blinking his eyes sleepily, while Astro, the\nthird member of the unit, a head taller than either of his unit-mates\nand fifty pounds heavier, stood flat-footed on the step, eyes closed,\nhis giant bulk swaying slightly with the motion of the slidestairs.\n\n\"Huh! A real snappy unit!\" Tom muttered to himself.\n\n\"Hmmm? What?\" Roger blinked and stared bleary-eyed at Tom.\n\n\"Nothing, Roger,\" Tom replied. \"I only hope you guys can stay awake long\nenough to get on the monorail.\"\n\n\"It's your own fault, Tom,\" rumbled Astro in his bull-like voice. \"If\nyour family hadn't thrown so many parties for us while we were on leave,\nwe'd have had more sleep.\"\n\n\"I didn't hear any complaints then,\" snorted Tom. \"Just get into the car\nbefore you cork off, will you? I'm in no shape to carry you.\"\n\nSeconds later, the slidestairs deposited the three boys on the platform\nand they slowly made their way through the crowd toward the forward cars\nof the monorail. Entering the third car, they found three seats together\nand collapsed into their luxurious softness.\n\n\"Oh, brother!\" Tom groaned as he curled himself into the cushions, \"I'm\ngoing to sleep all the way to the Academy.\"\n\n\"I'm asleep already,\" mumbled Roger, his voice muffled by his cap pulled\nlow over his face.\n\nSuddenly Astro sat bolt upright. \"I'm hungry!\" he announced.\n\n\"Oh, no!\" moaned Tom.\n\n\"Why, you overgrown Venusian ape, Mrs. Corbett gave you dinner less than\nan hour ago!\" Roger complained. \"Steak, French fries, beans, corn, pie,\nice cream....\"\n\n\"Two helpings,\" chimed in Tom.\n\n\"And now you're hungry!\" Roger was incredulous.\n\n\"Can't help it,\" calmly answered Astro. \"I'm a big guy, that's all.\" He\nbegan digging through his space bag for an apple Mrs. Corbett had\nthoughtfully provided.\n\nTom finally stirred and sat up. He had learned a long time ago the\nfutility of trying to deny Astro's Gargantuan appetite. \"There's a\ndining car on this section of the monorail, Astro,\" he said, slapping a\ncrumpled mass of credits into the Venusian's hamlike hand. \"Here. Have\nyourself a good time.\" He slumped back in his seat and closed his eyes.\n\n\"Yeah,\" growled Roger, \"and when you come back, don't make any noise!\"\n\nAstro smiled. He got up carefully and climbed over his two sleeping\nmates. Standing in the aisle, he counted the credits Tom had given him\nand turned to the front of the car. Suddenly a heavy voice growled\nbehind him.\n\n\"One side, spaceboy!\"\n\nA hand grabbed him by the shoulder and pushed him to one side. Caught\noff balance, Astro fell back on his sleeping unit-mates.\n\n\"Hey! What th--\" stuttered Astro as he sprawled on top of his friends.\nThe two sleepy cadets came up howling.\n\n\"Astro! What in blazes do you think you're doing?\" roared Tom.\n\n\"Why, you space-brained idiot,\" yelled Roger, \"I ought to lay one on\nyour chin!\"\n\nThere was a tangle of arms and legs and finally the three cadets\nstruggled to their feet. Astro turned to see who had pushed him.\n\nTwo men standing at the end of the car grinned back at him.\n\n\"It was those two guys at the end of the car,\" explained Astro. \"They\npushed me!\" He lumbered toward them, followed by Tom and Roger.\n\nStopping squarely in front of them, he demanded, \"What's the big idea?\"\n\n\"Go back to your beauty rest, spaceboy!\" jeered the heavier of the two\nmen and turned to his companion, adding with a snarl, \"How do you like\nhis nerve? We not only have to pay taxes to support these lazy kids and\nteach them how to be spacemen, but they're loud-mouthed and sassy on top\nof it!\"\n\nThe other man, smaller and rat-faced, laughed. \"Yeah, we oughta report\nthem to their little soldier bosses at Space Academy.\"\n\nAstro suddenly balled his fists and stepped forward, but Tom grabbed his\narm and pulled him back while Roger eased himself between his mates and\nthe two grinning men.\n\n\"You know, Tom,\" he drawled, looking the heavier of the two right in the\neye, \"the only thing I don't like about being a Space Cadet is having to\nbe polite to _all_ the people, including the space crawlers!\"\n\n\"Why, you little punk,\" sneered the bigger man, \"I oughta wipe up the\ndeck with you!\"\n\nRoger smiled thinly. \"Don't try it, mister. You wouldn't know what hit\nyou!\"\n\n\"Come on, Wallace,\" said the smaller man. \"Leave 'em alone and let's\ngo.\"\n\nAstro took another step forward and roared, \"Blast off. Both of you!\"\n\nThe two men turned quickly and disappeared through the door leading to\nthe next monorail car.\n\nThe three cadets turned and headed back down the aisle to their seats.\n\n\"Let's get some sleep,\" said Tom. \"We better be in good shape for that\nnew assignment when we hit the Academy. No telling what it'll be, where\nwe'll go, or worse yet, when we'll blast off. And I, for one, want to\nhave a good night's rest under my belt.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" agreed Roger, settling himself into the cushions once more.\n\"Wonder what the orders will be. Got any ideas, Tom?\"\n\n\"No idea at all, Roger,\" answered Tom. \"The audiogram just said report\nback to the Academy immediately for assignment.\"\n\n\"Hey, Astro!\" exclaimed Roger, seeing the Venusian climb back into his\nseat. \"Aren't you going to eat?\"\n\n\"I'm not hungry any more,\" grunted Astro. \"Those guys made me lose my\nappetite.\"\n\nTom looked at Roger and winked. \"Maybe we'd better tell Captain Strong\nabout this, Roger.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Get Astro mad enough and he won't want to eat. The Academy can cut down\non its food bills.\"\n\n\"Ah, rocket off, you guys,\" growled Astro sleepily.\n\nTom and Roger smiled at each other, closed their eyes, and in a moment\nthe three cadets of the Polaris unit were sound asleep.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSuspended from a single gleaming rail that stretched across the western\nplains like an endless silver ribbon, the monorail express hurtled\nthrough the early dawn speeding its passengers to their destination. As\nthe gleaming line of streamlined cars crossed the newly developed\ngrazing lands that had once been the great American desert, Tom Corbett\nstirred from a deep sleep. The slanting rays of the morning sun were\nshining in his eyes. Tom yawned, stretched, and turned to the viewport\nto watch the scenery flash past. Looming up over the flat grassy plains\nahead, he could see a huge bluish mountain range, its many peaks covered\nwith ever-present snow. In a few moments Tom knew the train would rocket\nthrough a tunnel and then on the other side, in the center of a deep,\nwide valley, he would see Space Academy, the university of the planets\nand headquarters of the great Solar Guard.\n\nHe reached over and shook Roger and Astro, calling, \"All right,\nspacemen, time to hit the deck!\"\n\n\"Uh? Ah-ummmh!\" groaned Roger.\n\n\"Ahhhoooohhhhhh!\" yawned Astro. Standing up, he stretched and touched\nthe top of the monorail car.\n\n\"Let's get washed before the other passengers wake up,\" said Tom, and\nheaded for the morning room. Astro and Roger followed, dragging their\nfeet and rubbing their eyes.\n\nFive minutes later, as the sleek monorail whistled into the tunnel\nbeneath the mountain range, the boys of the _Polaris_ unit returned to\ntheir seats.\n\n\"Back to the old grind,\" sighed Roger. \"Drills, maneuvers, books,\nlectures. The same routine, day in day out.\"\n\n\"Maybe not,\" said Tom. \"Remember, the order for us to report back was\nsigned by Commander Walters, not the cadet supervisor of leaves. I think\nthat means something special.\"\n\nSuddenly the monorail roared out of the tunnel and into brilliant\nearly-morning sun again.\n\nThe three cadets turned quickly, their eyes sweeping the valley for the\nfirst sight of the shining Tower of Galileo.\n\n\"There it is,\" said Tom, pointing toward a towering crystal building\nreflecting the morning light. \"We'll be there in a minute.\"\n\nEven as Tom spoke, the speed of the monorail slackened as it eased past\na few gleaming structures of aluminum and concrete. Presently the white\nplatform of the Academy station drifted past the viewport and all\nforward motion stopped. The doors opened and the three boys hurried to\nthe exit.\n\nAll around the cadets, men and women in the vari-colored uniforms of the\nSolar Guard hurried through the station. The green of the Earthworm\ncadets, first-year students of the Cadet Corps; the brilliant rich blue\nof the senior cadets like the _Polaris_ unit; the scarlet red of the\nenlisted Solar Guard; and here and there, the black and gold of the\nofficers of the Solar Guard.\n\nThe three cadets hurried to the nearest slidewalk, a moving belt of\nplastic that glided silently across the ground toward Space Academy. It\nwhisked them quickly past the few buildings nestled around the monorail\nstation and rounded a curve. The three cadets looked up together at the\ngleaming Tower of Galileo. Made of pure Titan crystal, it soared above\nthe cluster of buildings that surrounded the grassy quadrangle and\ndominated Space Academy like a translucent giant.\n\nThe cadets stepped off the slidewalk as it glided past the Tower\nbuilding and ran up the broad marble stair. At the huge main portal, Tom\nstopped and looked back over the Academy grounds. All around him lay the\nevidence of mankind's progress. It was the year 2353, when Earthman had\nlong since colonized the inner planets, Mars and Venus, and the three\nlarge satellites, Moon of Earth, Ganymede of Jupiter, and Titan of\nSaturn. It was the age of space travel; of the Solar Alliance, a unified\nsociety of billions of people who lived in peace with one another,\nthough sprawled throughout the universe; and the Solar Guard, the might\nof the Solar Alliance and the defender of interplanetary peace. All\nthese things Tom saw as he stood in the wide portal of the Tower\nBuilding, flanked by Astro and Roger.\n\nTurning into the Tower, the three cadets went directly to the office of\ntheir unit commander. The training program at Space Academy consisted of\nthree cadets to a unit, with a Solar Guard officer as their teacher and\ninstructor. Steve Strong, captain in the Solar Guard, had been their\ncadet instructor since the unit had been formed and he now smiled a\nwelcome as the cadets snapped to attention in front of his desk.\n\n\"_Polaris_ unit reporting as ordered, sir,\" said Tom, handing over the\naudiogram order he had received the day before.\n\n\"Thank you, Corbett,\" said Strong, taking the paper. \"At ease.\"\n\nThe three boys relaxed and broke into wide grins as Strong rounded his\ndesk and shook hands with each of them.\n\n\"Glad to have you back, boys,\" he said. \"Did you enjoy your leave?\"\n\n\"And how, sir,\" replied Tom.\n\n\"Tom's mother showed us a whale of a good time,\" chimed in Roger.\n\n\"And how she can cook!\" Astro licked his lips involuntarily.\n\n\"Well, I hope you had a good rest--\" said Strong, but was suddenly\ninterrupted by the sound of a small bell. Behind his desk a small\nteleceiver screen glowed into life to reveal the stern face of Commander\nWalters, the commander of Space Academy.\n\nStrong turned to the teleceiver and called, \"Yes, Commander Walters?\"\n\n\"Did the _Polaris_ unit arrive yet, Steve?\" asked the commander.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Strong. \"They're here in my office now, sir.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said the commander with a smile. \"I just received a report the\nexposition will open sooner than expected. I suggest you brief the\ncadets and raise ship as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir,\" answered Strong. The screen darkened and he turned\nback to the cadets. \"Looks like you got back just in time.\"\n\n\"What's up, sir?\" asked Tom.\n\nStrong returned to his chair and sat down. \"I suppose you've all heard\nabout the Solar Exposition that opens on Venus next week?\"\n\nTom's eyes lit up. \"Have we! That's all the stereos and visunews and\nteleceivers have been yacking about for weeks now.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Strong with a smile, \"we're going!\"\n\nThe three cadets couldn't restrain themselves and burst out in a happy\nshout. Then Roger calmed down enough to comment, \"Sounds more like\nanother vacation than an assignment, sir.\"\n\n\"Hardly, Manning,\" replied Strong. \"You see, every industry, society,\norganization, and governmental agency is setting up exhibits at the\nexposition to show the people what's taking place in their part of the\nsolar system. There'll also be an amusement section.\" Strong chuckled.\n\"I've seen pictures of some of the tricks and rides they've developed to\nentertain the younger generation. Believe me, I'd rather take full\nacceleration on a rocket ship than ride on any of them.\"\n\n\"But what will we do, sir?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"Our job is very simple. We're to take the _Polaris_ to the exposition\nand land on the fairgrounds. When the fair opens, we show all the\nvisitors who are interested, everything about her.\"\n\n\"You mean we're going to be\"--Roger swallowed--\"guides?\"\n\n\"That's right, Manning,\" said Strong. \"You three will guide all visitors\nthrough the _Polaris_.\"\n\n\"How long will we be there, sir?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"A month or so, I guess. The _Polaris_ will be the first Academy\nexhibit. When you leave, another unit will replace you with their ship\nand do the same thing.\"\n\n\"But--but--\" stammered Astro, \"what will we say to them? The visitors, I\nmean?\"\n\n\"Just answer all their questions, Astro. Also, make up a little speech\nabout the functions of your particular station.\"\n\nStrong looked at his watch and rose to his feet. \"It's getting late.\nCheck the _Polaris_ over and stand by to raise ship in an hour.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Tom.\n\nThe cadets came to attention, preparing to leave.\n\n\"One thing more! Don't get the idea that this is going to be a space\nlark,\" said Strong. \"It's very important for the people of the Solar\nAlliance to know what kind of work we're doing here at the Academy. And\nyou three have been selected as representatives of the entire Cadet\nCorps. So see that you conduct yourselves accordingly. All right,\ndismissed!\"\n\nThe three cadets saluted sharply and filed out of the room, their\nskipper's final words ringing in their ears.\n\nFifteen minutes later, having packed the necessary gear for the extended\ntrip, the _Polaris_ unit rode the slidewalk through the grassy\nquadrangle and the cluster of Academy buildings, out toward the\nspaceport. In the distance they could see the rocket cruiser _Polaris_,\npoised on the launching ramp, her long silhouette outlined sharply\nagainst the blue sky. Resting on her four stabilizer fins, her nose\npointed toward the stars, the ship looked like a giant projectile poised\nand ready to blast its target.\n\n\"Look at her!\" exclaimed Astro. \"If she isn't the most beautiful ship in\nthe universe, I'll eat my hat.\"\n\n\"Don't see how you could,\" drawled Roger, \"after the way you put away\nMrs. Corbett's pies!\"\n\nTom laughed. \"I'll tell you one thing, Roger,\" he said, pointing to the\nship, \"I feel like that baby is as much my home as Mom's and Dad's house\nback in New Chicago.\"\n\n\"All right, all right,\" said Roger. \"Since we're all getting sloppy, I\nhave to admit that I'm glad to see that old thrust bucket too!\"\n\nPresently the three cadets were scrambling into the mighty spaceship,\nand they went right to work, preparing for blast-off.\n\nQuickly, with sure hands, each began a systematic check of his station.\nOn the power deck Astro, a former enlisted Solar Guardsman who had been\nadmitted to the Cadet Corps because of his engineering genius, stripped\nto the waist and started working on the ship's massive atomic engines. A\nheavy rocketman's belt of tools slung around his waist, he crawled\nthrough the heart of the ship, adjusting a valve here, turning a screw\nthere, seeing that the reactant feeders were clean and clear to the\nrocket firing chambers. And last of all he made sure the great rocket\nfiring chambers were secure and the heavy sheets of lead baffling in\nplace to protect him from deadly radioactivity.\n\nOn the radar bridge in the nose of the ship, Roger removed the delicate\nastrogation prism from its housing and cleaned it with a soft cloth.\nReplacing it carefully, he turned to the radar scanner, checking the\nintricate wiring system and making sure that the range finders were in\ngood working order. He then turned his attention to the intercom.\n\n\"Radar bridge to control deck,\" he called. \"Checking the intercom, Tom.\"\n\nImmediately below, on the control deck, Tom turned away from the control\npanel. \"All clear here, Roger. Check with Astro.\"\n\n\"All clear on the power deck!\" The big Venusian's voice boomed over the\nloud-speaker. The intercom could be heard all over the ship unless the\nmany speakers were turned off individually.\n\nTom turned his attention back to the great control panel, and one by one\ntested the banks of dials, gauges, and indicators that controlled the\nrocket cruiser. Tom Corbett had wanted to be a space Cadet as long as he\ncould remember. After taking the entrance exams, he had been accepted\nfor the rigid training that would prepare him to enter the ranks of the\ngreat Solar Guard. He had met his two unit-mates, Roger and Astro, on\nhis very first day at the Academy, and after a difficult beginning,\nadjusting to each other's personalities and the discipline of the\nAcademy routine, the three boys had become steadfast friends.\n\nAs control-deck cadet and pilot, Tom was head of the unit,\nsecond-in-command to Captain Strong. And while he could issue orders to\nAstro and Roger and expect to be obeyed, the three cadets all spoke\ntheir minds when it came to making difficult decisions. This had\nsolidified the three cadets into a fighting, experienced, dependable\nunit.\n\nTom made a final check on the gravity generator and turned to the\nintercom.\n\n\"All departments, report!\" he called.\n\n\"Radar bridge checks in O.K.,\" replied Roger.\n\n\"Power deck checks in on the nose, Tom,\" reported Astro.\n\n\"Right! Stand by! We blast as soon as the skipper gets around.\"\n\nTom turned to the teleceiver and switched it on. The screen blurred and\nthen steadied into a view of the spaceport outside. Tom scanned the\nlaunching ramp below, and, satisfied it was clear, he switched the\nteleceiver to the spaceport traffic-control circuit.\n\n\"Rocket cruiser _Polaris_ to spaceport control,\" he called. \"Come in,\nspaceport control. Request orbit clearance.\"\n\n\"Spaceport traffic control to _Polaris_,\" reported the traffic officer,\nhis face in focus on the teleceiver screen. \"Your orbit has been cleared\nfor blast-off. Orbit number 3847--repeat, 3847--raise ship when ready!\"\n\n\"Orbit 3847,\" repeated Tom. \"End transmission!\"\n\n\"End transmission,\" said the officer. Tom flipped off the teleceiver and\nthe officer's face disappeared.\n\nAt the rear of the control deck, Captain Strong suddenly stepped through\nthe hatch and dropped his black plastic space bag on the deck. Tom got\nup and saluted sharply.\n\n\"_Polaris_ ready to blast off, sir,\" he said. \"Orbit cleared.\"\n\n\"Very well, Corbett,\" replied Strong, returning the salute. \"Carry on!\"\n\nTom turned back to the control board and flipped on the intercom.\n\"Control deck to power deck! Energize the cooling pumps!\"\n\n\"Cooling pumps, aye!\" said Astro.\n\nFrom the power deck, the massive pumps began their whining roar. The\ngreat ship shuddered under the pressure.\n\nTom watched the gauge that indicated the pressure control and then\ncalled into the intercom.\n\n\"Radar bridge, do we have a clear trajectory?'\n\n\"All clear forward and up, Tom,\" reported Roger from the radar bridge.\n\n\"Strap in for blast-off!\" bawled the curly-haired cadet.\n\nCaptain Strong took his place in the pilot's chair next to Tom and\nstrapping himself in snapped out, \"Feed reactant!\"\n\nSpinning a small wheel at the side of the control panel, Tom reported,\n\"Feeders at D-9 rate, sir!\"\n\nThen, as the hiss of fuel pouring into the mighty engines of the ship\nblended with the whine of the pumps, Tom snapped out a third order. \"Cut\nin take-off six yards!\"\n\nReceiving acknowledgment from below, he grasped the master blast-off\nswitch and watched the sweeping hand of the astral chronometer.\n\n\"Stand by to raise ship!\" he yelled. \"Blast off\nminus--five--four--three--two--one--_zero_!\"\n\nHe pulled the switch.\n\nSlowly, the rockets blasting evenly, the giant ship lifted itself free\nof the ground. Then, gaining speed, it began rocketing away from the\nEarth. Like a giant shining bullet, the great spaceship blasted through\nthe dark void of space, her nose pointed to the distant misty planet of\nVenus.\n\nOnce again Tom Corbett and his unit-mates had embarked on a mission for\nthe Solar Guard.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\n\n\"Stand by for touchdown!\" bellowed Captain Strong's voice on the big\nspaceship's intercom.\n\n\"Control deck standing by,\" replied Tom.\n\n\"Corbett,\" Strong continued, \"you may take her down as soon as you get\nclearance from Venusport traffic control.\"\n\nTom acknowledged the order with a brisk \"Aye, sir! In a few moments he\nreceived permission to touch down on the newly colonized planet. Then,\nturning his attention to the control board, he requested a\nground-approach check from Roger.\n\n\"About two miles to touchdown, Tom,\" reported Roger from the radar\nbridge. \"Trajectory clear!\"\n\n\"O.K., Roger,\" said Tom. Glancing quickly at the air speed and rocket\nthrust indicators, he flipped a switch and sang out, \"Power deck, reduce\nthrust on main drive rockets to minimum!\"\n\n\"Got ya, Tom,\" boomed Astro.\n\n\"Closing in fast, sir,\" said Tom to Strong, who had come up from below\nand now stood at the cadet's shoulder watching as Tom maneuvered the big\nship through the Venusian atmosphere, his keen eyes sweeping the great\npanel of recording gauges and dials.\n\n\"One thousand feet to touchdown,\" intoned Roger from the radar bridge.\n\nReacting swiftly, Tom adjusted several levers, then picking up the\nintercom microphone, he threw a switch and yelled, \"Power deck! Full\nbraking thrust!\"\n\nDeep inside the _Polaris_, Astro, who tended the mighty rocket power\nplant with loving care, eased home the sensitive control mechanism,\napplying even pressure to the braking rockets.\n\nAs the giant spaceship settled smoothly to within a few feet of the\nsurface of the concrete spaceport, Tom threw the master switch that cut\nall power. A moment later the huge craft dropped easily, then settled on\nthe landing platform with a gentle thump.\n\n\"Touchdown!\" yelled Tom. Then, glancing at the astral chronometer on the\ncontrol board, he turned to Strong, and saluting smartly, reported,\n\"_Polaris_ completes space flight at exactly seven fifty-two-O-two!\"\n\nStrong returned the salute. \"Very well, Tom. Now, I want you, Roger, and\nAstro to come with me to the exposition commissioner's office for an\ninterview and detailed orders.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Tom.\n\nA few minutes later, dressed in fresh uniforms, the three cadets\nfollowed their unit commander out of the ship, then stood by as Strong\nordered the chief petty officer of an enlisted Solar Guard working party\nto prepare the _Polaris_ for moving to the exposition site.\n\n\"Empty the reactant fuel tanks of all but enough for us to raise ship\nand touch down over to the fairgrounds,\" said Strong. \"Better strip her\nof armament, too. Paralo-ray pistols and rifles, the three-inch and\nsix-inch atomic blasters, narco sleeping gas; in fact, everything that\ncould possibly cause any trouble.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied the scarlet-clad enlisted spaceman.\n\n\"One thing more,\" added Strong. \"There will be a crew living aboard, so\nplease see that the galley is stocked with a full supply of both fresh\nand synthetic foods. That's about all, I guess.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir,\" replied the petty officer with a crisp salute. He\nturned and began bawling orders to a squad of men behind him and\nimmediately they were swarming over the great ship like ants.\n\nFifteen minutes later, a jet cab swerved to a stop in front of the\ntallest of the Venusport buildings, the Solar Alliance Chamber. Strong\npaid the driver, adding a handsome tip, and flanked by his three cadets\nstrode briskly into the building.\n\nCrossing a high-ceilinged lobby, they entered an express vacuum elevator\nand five seconds later stepped out onto the four-hundredth floor. There,\nStrong slid a panel door to one side, and, followed by the cadets,\nstepped inside the office of Mike Hawks, exposition commissioner and\nretired senior officer of the Solar Guard.\n\nThe office was impressively large and airy, with an outside wall forming\na viewport of clear Titan crystal reaching from floor to vaulted ceiling\nand affording a magnificent view of the city of Venusport and, beyond\nit, the futuristic buildings of the exposition itself. Another wall,\nequally as large, was covered by a map of the exposition grounds.\n\nMike Hawks, a man with steel-gray hair, clear blue eyes, and a ramrod\nmilitary bearing, sat behind a massive desk talking to two men. He\nlooked up when Strong and the cadets walked in and rose quickly with a\nbroad smile to greet them.\n\n\"Steve!\" he exclaimed, rounding the desk to shake hands with his old\nfriend. \"I never dreamed we'd have you and the _Polaris_ unit at our\nfair!\" He nodded warmly to the cadets who stood at rigid attention. \"At\nease, cadets. Glad to have you aboard.\"\n\n\"I was just as surprised to get this assignment, Mike,\" said Strong,\npumping the officer's hand. Nodding toward the men seated in front of\nHawks' desk, he apologized, \"Sorry to bust in on you like this, old man.\nDidn't know you were busy.\"\n\n\"It's quite all right.\" The commissioner smiled. \"Just handing out a few\nlicenses for the concessions in the amusement section at the fair.\nPeople expect to have a little fun when they go to a fair, you know. By\nthe stars, they're going to have it so long as I'm commissioner.\" He\nturned to the cadets. \"Sit down, boys. You too, Steve. I'll be with you\nin a minute.\" He turned back to his desk and the waiting men.\n\nThe cadets, at a nod from Strong, sat down on a leather couch that\nstretched the length of one wall and listened while Hawks completed his\nbusiness with the two men.\n\n\"There you are,\" said Hawks, applying the seal of his office to a slip\nof paper. \"That gives you the right to operate a concession in the\namusement area as long as the fair is open.\"\n\nOne of the men took the paper and glanced at it quickly.\n\n\"Wait a minute, Commissioner. This is over near the edge of the area,\"\nhe complained. \"We wanted to get in the middle. How do you expect us to\nmake any credits away out there by ourselves?\" The man's tone was surly\nand disrespectful.\n\n\"Sorry, but that's the only location left. In fact,\" Hawks added acidly,\n\"you're lucky to get it!\"\n\n\"Really?\" sneered the heavier of the two. \"Well, I'm sure going to find\nout about this!\"\n\nHawks stood up and eyed the two men coldly. \"I've been appointed\ncommissioner of this exposition by the delegates to the Solar Alliance\nCouncil. I answer only to the council. If you have a complaint, then you\nmust present your case before that body.\" He cleared his throat and\nglared at them from behind his desk. \"Good day, gentlemen!\" he said.\n\n[Illustration: _Hawks stood up and eyed the two men coldly_]\n\nThe two men, who until now had been seated facing the desk, got up, and\nafter glaring at Hawks, turned and walked toward the door. Tom gasped,\nand grabbing Roger by the arm, involuntarily pointed at the two men.\n\n\"Look, Roger--those men--\" he whispered.\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Roger. \"Those are the wise-guy space crawlers we met on the\nmonorail, the ones who called us punks!\"\n\n\"How'd they get here so fast?\" asked Astro.\n\n\"Must have taken a jetliner from Atom City, I guess.\"\n\nStrong, who sat near Tom, heard the exchange between the cadets.\n\n\"You know those men?\" he asked.\n\n\"Well--uh--not exactly, sir. We just had a little run-in with them on\nthe monorail returning from leave, that's all,\" said Tom. \"Nothing\nserious. They don't think much of the Solar Guard, though.\"\n\n\"I gathered as much,\" said Hawks dryly. He walked over from his desk. \"I\nhated to give them the license to operate, but I had to, since I had no\nvalid reason to turn them down. They have a good idea, too.\"\n\n\"That so? What is it?\" asked Strong.\n\n\"They have an old chemical-burning space freighter in which they're\ngoing to take fair visitors up for a short ride. You see, the big one,\nGus Wallace, is an old deep-space merchantman. The smaller one is Luther\nSimms, a rocketman.\"\n\n\"Hm. Not a bad idea at all,\" mused Strong. \"They should make out all\nright.\"\n\nWith that, the two Solar Guard officers dropped the incident of Wallace\nand Simms and turned to exchanging news of mutual friends and of what\neach had been doing since their last meeting. Finally, as the\nconversation was brought around to the exposition, Hawks got up and sat\non the side of the desk, facing Strong and the cadets. His eyes glowed\nas he spoke.\n\n\"Steve,\" he said, \"this is going to be the greatest gathering of minds,\nthoughts, and ideas in the knowledgeable history of mankind! There are\ngoing to be lectures from the greatest minds in the system on any and\nall subjects you can think of. In one building we're going to build a\nwhole spaceship--a rocket cruiser--piece by piece, right in front of the\neyes of fair visitors. In another building we're going to have the\ngreatest collection of musicians in the universe, continuously playing\nthe most beautiful music, in a hall built to seat a half million people.\nIndustry, science, medicine, art, literature, astrophysics, space\nflight, to say nothing of a comparative history exhibit designed to show\nthe people where our forefathers went off the track by warring against\neach other. In fact, Steve, everything you can think of, and then more,\nwill be represented here at the exposition. Why, do you know I've been\nworking for three years, co-ordinating ideas, activity, and\ninformation!\"\n\nStrong and the cadets sat transfixed as they listened to the\ncommissioner speak in glowing terms of the exposition, which, until this\ntime, by the cadets at least, had been considered little more than a\ngiant amusement park. Finally Strong managed to say, \"And we thought the\n_Polaris_ was going to be so big, it'd be the center of attraction.\" He\nsmiled.\n\nHawks waved his hand. \"Look, I don't want to offend you or the boys,\nSteve, but the fact is, the _Polaris_ is one of the _smaller_ exhibits!\"\n\n\"I can see that now,\" answered Strong. \"Tell me, Mike, just what do you\nwant us to do?\"\n\n\"I'll answer that in two parts. First, I would like the cadets to set up\nthe _Polaris_, get her shining and bright, and with quiet courtesy,\nanswer any question anyone might ask concerning the ship, referring any\nquestion they can't answer to the information center in the Space\nBuilding.\"\n\n\"That's all, sir?\" asked Tom incredulously.\n\n\"That's all, Corbett. You open the _Polaris_ at nine in the morning and\nclose her at nine at night. You'll be living aboard, of course.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Of course, sir.\"\n\n\"That sounds so simple,\" drawled Roger, \"it might be tough.\"\n\n\"It will be tough, Manning,\" commented Hawks. \"Don't fool yourself into\nassuming otherwise.\"\n\n\"Don't worry about these boys, Mike. Now, what is part two?\" Strong\nasked.\n\nHawks smiled. \"Here it is, Steve. The Solar Alliance has decided to open\nthe exposition with a simple speech made by a relatively unknown person,\nbut one who is deserving of such an honor. They left the choice of that\nperson up to me.\" He paused and added quietly, \"I'd like you to make\nthat opening speech, Steve.\"\n\n\"Me!\" cried Strong. \"Me, make a speech?\"\n\n\"I can't think of anyone more deserving--or dependable.\"\n\n\"But--but--\" stammered the captain, \"I can't make a speech. I wouldn't\nknow what to say.\"\n\n\"Say anything you want. Just make it short and to the point.\"\n\nStrong hesitated a moment. He realized it was a great honor, but his\nnaturally shy personality kept him from accepting.\n\n\"Steve, it may make it easier for you to know,\" said Hawks teasingly,\n\"that there's going to be a giant capsule lowered into the ground which\nwill contain a record of every bit of progress made since the inception\nof the Solar Alliance. It's designed to show the men of the future how\nto do everything from treating a common cold to exploding nuclear power.\nThis capsule will be lowered at the end of your opening address. So,\nmost of the attention will be focused on the capsule, not you.\" The\ncommissioner smiled.\n\n\"All right, Mike,\" said Strong, grinning sheepishly. \"You've got\nyourself a speechmaker!\"\n\n\"Good!\" said Hawks and the two men shook hands.\n\nTom Corbett could contain himself no longer. \"Congratulations, sir!\" he\nblurted out as the three cadets stood up. \"We think Commissioner Hawks\ncouldn't have made a better choice!\" His unit-mates nodded a vigorous\nassent.\n\nStrong shook hands with the cadets and thanked them.\n\n\"You want the cadets for anything right now, Mike?\" asked Strong.\n\n\"Not a thing, Steve.\"\n\nStrong turned back to the boys. \"Better hop out to the spaceport and get\nthe _Polaris_ over the exposition site, cadets. Soon as you set her\ndown, clean her up a little, then relax. I'll be at the Galaxy Hotel if\nyou need me.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Tom.\n\nThe cadets saluted sharply and left the office.\n\nArriving at the spaceport, they found the _Polaris_ stripped of her guns\nand her galley stocked with food. The chief petty officer in charge of\nthe enlisted spacemen detail was roving through the passageways of the\nrocket cruiser when Tom found him.\n\n\"Everything set, chief?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"All set, Cadet Corbett,\" reported the elderly spaceman, saluting\nsmartly. He gave Tom a receipt for the list of the equipment that had\nbeen removed from the ship and signed the logbook. Tom thanked him and\nmade a hurried check of the control deck, with Roger and Astro reporting\nfrom the radar and power decks. With the precision and assurance of\nveteran spacemen, the three Space Cadets lifted the great ship up over\nthe heart of the sprawling Venusian city and brought it down gently in\nthe clearing provided for it at the exposition site, a grassy square\nsurrounded on three sides by buildings of shimmering crystal walls.\n\nNo sooner had the giant ship settled itself to the ground, than a crew\nof exposition workers began laying a slidewalk toward her, while another\ncrew began the construction of an aluminum staircase to the entrance\nport in her giant fin.\n\nAlmost before they realized it, Tom, Roger, and Astro found themselves\nbusy with a hundred little things concerning the ship and their part in\nthe fair. They were visited by the subcommissioner of the exposition and\nadvised of the conveniences provided for the participants of the fair.\nThen, finally, as a last worker finished the installation of a\nphotoelectric cell across the entrance port to count visitors to the\nship, Tom, Roger, and Astro began the dirty job of washing down the\ngiant titanium hull with a special cleaning fluid, while all around them\nthe activity of the fair buzzed with nervous excitement.\n\nSuddenly the three cadets heard the unmistakable roar of jets in the\nsky. Automatically, they looked up and saw a spaceship, nose up,\ndecelerating as it came in for a touchdown on a clearing across one of\nthe wide spacious streets of the fairgrounds.\n\n\"Well, blast my jets!\" exclaimed Astro, his eyes clinging to the flaming\nexhausts as the ship lowered itself to the ground.\n\n\"That craft must be at least fifty years old!\"\n\n\"I've got a rocket-blasting good idea, Tom,\" said Roger.\n\nThe exit port of the spaceship opened, and the three cadets watched Gus\nWallace and Luther Simms climb down the ladder.\n\n\"Hey,\" yelled Roger, \"better be careful with that broken-down old\nboiler. It might blow up!\"\n\nThe two men glared at the grinning Roger but didn't answer.\n\n\"Take it easy, Roger,\" cautioned Tom. \"We don't want to start anything\nthat might cause us and Captain Strong trouble before the fair even\nopens. So let's leave them alone.\"\n\n\"What are you afraid of?\" drawled Roger, a mischievous gleam in his\neyes. \"Just a little fun with those guys won't hurt.\" He stepped to the\nside of the clearing and leaned over the fence separating the two areas.\n\n\"Tell me something, spaceman,\" he yelled to Wallace, who was busy with\nsome gear at the base of the ship, \"you don't expect people to pay to\nride that thing, do you?\" He smiled derisively and added, \"Got insurance\nto cover the families?\"\n\n\"Listen, punk!\" sneered Wallace, \"get back over to your Solar Guard\nspace toy and keep your trap shut!\"\n\n\"Now--now--\" jeered Roger, \"mustn't get nasty. Remember, we're going to\nbe neighbors. Never can tell when you might want to borrow some baling\nwire or chewing gum to keep your craft together!\"\n\n\"Look, wise guy, one more crack out of you, and I'll send you out of\nthis world without a spaceship!\" snarled Wallace through grating teeth.\n\n\"Any time you'd like to try that, you know where I am,\" Roger snapped\nback.\n\n\"Okay, punk! You asked for it,\" yelled Wallace. He had been holding a\nlength of chain and now he swung it at Roger. The cadet ducked easily,\nhopped over the fence, and before Wallace knew what was happening,\njolted him with three straight lefts and a sharp right cross. Wallace\nwent down in a heap, out cold.\n\nLuther Simms, who had been watching the affair from one side, now rushed\nat Roger with a monkey wrench. With the ferocity of a bull, Astro roared\nat the small spaceman, who stopped as if pulled up by a string. Roger\nspun around, made an exaggerated bow, and smiling, asked, \"Next?\"\n\nAt this point, aware that things were getting a bit thick, Tom strode\nacross the clearing, and grabbing the still smiling Roger, pulled him\naway.\n\n\"Are you space happy?\" he asked, \"You know you goaded him into swinging\nthat chain, Roger. And that makes you entirely responsible for what just\nhappened!\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" growled Astro. \"Suppose he had hit you with it, then what?\"\n\nRoger, still grinning, glanced over his shoulder and saw Simms helping\nWallace to his feet. He turned to Astro, threw his arm over the big\ncadet's shoulder, and drawled, \"Why, then you'd have just taken them\napart to avenge me! Wouldn't you, pal?\"\n\n\"Aw, stow it,\" snapped Tom. For a second Roger looked at him sharply,\nthen broke into a smile again. \"O.K., Tom, I'm sorry,\" he said. \"O.K.,\nlet's get back to work,\" ordered Tom.\n\nBack at the _Polaris_, as they continued cleaning the hull of the ship,\nTom saw the two men disappear into their craft, throwing dirty looks\nback at the three cadets as they went.\n\n\"You know, Roger, I think you made a very bad mistake,\" he said. \"One\nway or another, they'll try to even the score with you.\"\n\n\"And it won't be just a report to Captain Strong,\" added Astro darkly.\n\nRoger, cocky and unafraid, broke out his engaging grin again and\nshrugged his shoulders.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\n\n\"... And so we dedicate this capsule to the civilizations of the future.\nThose who may dig this cylinder out of the ground in ages to come will\nfind within it the tools, the inventions, and the scientific wonders\nwhich have made the era of the Solar Alliance one of peace and lasting\nprosperity.\"\n\nCaptain Steve Strong paused, glanced at the huge crane and the\nshimmering steel capsule that dangled at the end of a cable, then called\nout, \"Lower the capsule!\"\n\nThe cheers of a hundred thousand people massed in the exposition plaza\ngreeted the order. The stereo camera and teleceiver scanners that were\nsending the opening ceremonies of the Solar Exposition to all parts of\nthe Alliance moved in to focus on the capsule as it was lowered into a\ndeep, concrete-lined pit.\n\nThe three members of the _Polaris_ unit, standing to one side of the\nplatform, joined in the cheers as their skipper shook hands with the\ndelegates and waved again and again at the roaring crowd.\n\n\"That was some speech, Tom,\" commented Roger. \"I wonder who wrote it for\nhim?\"\n\n\"He wrote it himself, Roger,\" replied Tom.\n\n\"Ah, go on,\" scoffed Roger.\n\n\"Sure he did,\" said Astro indignantly. \"He sweated over it for nearly a\nweek.\"\n\n\"Here he comes,\" said Tom. The three cadets watched Captain Strong,\nresplendent in his dress gold-and-black uniform, fight his way off the\nplatform, shaking hands with congratulating strangers along the way.\n\n\"Congratulations, Captain Strong,\" said Tom with a smile.\n\n\"That was swell!\" Roger and Astro chorused their agreement.\n\n\"Thanks, boys,\" gasped Strong. \"But let me tell you, I never want to do\nthat again. I was never so scared in my life!\"\n\n\"Just making a speech?\" asked Roger. \"After all the lectures you've\ngiven at Space Academy?\"\n\n\"They weren't before teleceiver and stereo cameras.\" Strong laughed. \"Do\nyou realize this ceremony is being seen on Mars, Earth, and all the\ncolonized moons, clear out to Titan.\"\n\n\"Wow!\" breathed Astro. \"That would make me tongue-tied!\"\n\n\"Huh! All that to stick a metal box into the ground,\" snorted Roger.\n\n\"It's not the capsule, Roger,\" said Tom. \"It's what's inside the\ncapsule.\"\n\n\"Right, Tom,\" said Strong. \"Inside that capsule scientists have packed\nthe whole history of man's march through the stars. They've included\nscientific formulas, medical, cultural, and industrial facts. Everything\nwe know. Even some things that are known by only a handful of the most\ntrusted men in the universe!\" Strong stopped suddenly and laughed.\n\"There I go, making another speech! Come on. Let's get out of here,\" he\ncried.\n\n\"Do we start showing people through the _Polaris_ now, sir?\" asked\nAstro.\n\n\"In the morning, Astro,\" replied Strong. \"Tonight there's a big Solar\nAlliance banquet. You three are invited, too.\"\n\n\"Er--\" stammered Roger, \"you mean--a banquet--with--uh--?\"\n\nStrong laughed. \"More speeches? I'm afraid so, Manning. Of course\nthere'll be plenty of food.\"\n\n\"Well, it's not that we're against speeches,\" ventured Astro.\n\n\"Not yours anyway, sir,\" added Tom hastily. \"But what we mean, sir, is\nthat--\"\n\nStrong held up his hand. \"I understand perfectly. Suppose you stay here\non the exposition grounds. Have a look around. See the sights, have some\nfun.\"\n\n_\"Yes, sir!\"_ The boys chorused their reply.\n\n\"Just don't spend all your credits at the first booth,\" continued\nStrong. \"And watch that Venusian cloud candy. It's good, but murder on\nthe Earthman's stomach.\"\n\n\"Captain Strong!\" A voice called from the platform above. It was one of\nthe Venusian delegates. \"They want some pictures of you!\"\n\n\"Be right there, sir,\" replied Strong. He turned to the boys and smiled.\n\"You're lucky you don't have to go through this. See you aboard ship\nlater.\" Spinning quickly on his heel, he made his way back through the\ncrowd to the platform.\n\n\"What a great guy,\" sighed Tom.\n\n\"Sure is,\" agreed Astro.\n\n\"Well, fellas,\" announced Roger, \"we've got twelve hours liberty and a\nsmall scale model of the whole solar system to have fun in! What're we\nwaiting for?\"\n\nFighting their way through the crowds in the plaza, the three boys\nfinally reached the amusement area where they wandered among gaily\ncolored booths and plastic tents, their eyes lighting up with each new\nattraction.\n\nTwo hours later, stuffed with spaceburgers and Martian water, their arms\nloaded with assorted prizes, won by Astro's prowess in the\nweight-lifting booth, Tom's skill as a marksman, and Roger's luck at the\nwheels of chance, the cadets wearily returned to the Polaris.\n\nAs they neared their section of the fair site they heard a harsh voice\nappealing to a small crowd around the stand in front of Wallace and\nSimms' spaceship. A huge sign spelled out the attraction: RIDE IN\nSPACE--ONE CREDIT.\n\nLuther Simms, a bamboo cane in one hand, a roll of tickets in another,\nwas hawking his attraction to the bystanders.\n\n\"Step right up, ladies and gentlemen! Step right up! It's a thrill of a\nlifetime, the greatest sensation of the entire exposition. Ride a rocket\nship, and all this for one credit! A lone, single credit, ladies and\ngents, will buy you a pathway to the stars! Step right up--\"\n\nIn laughing groups, the crowd around the stand began to purchase tickets\nand climb aboard the old freighter.\n\nThe three cadets watched from the outer edge of the crowd.\n\n\"Hey, fellas,\" said Roger suddenly, \"whaddya say we go?\"\n\n\"What?\" gulped Astro. \"On that thing?\"\n\n\"Why not?\" urged Roger.\n\n\"But that hulk should have been shipped back to the scrap furnace years\nago!\" Tom protested.\n\n\"So what, Junior?\" drawled Roger. \"Scared?\"\n\n\"Don't be silly,\" replied Tom. \"But with all the other things to do\nhere, why should we--\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Astro, nudging Tom, \"now I get it!\"\n\n\"You get what?\" asked Roger innocently.\n\n\"Those girls,\" said Astro. \"They're just climbing aboard.\"\n\nGlancing at the air lock, Tom saw three young and pretty girls file into\nthe ship. \"Oh, so that's it, huh?\" he said, looking quizzically at his\nunit-mate.\n\n[Illustration: _Tom saw three pretty girls board the ship_]\n\nThe blond cadet's eyes were wide with mock surprise.\n\n\"Girls? Well, what do you know about that? I never noticed!\"\n\n\"Yeah, I'll bet you didn't!\" said Tom.\n\n\"Well, they _are_ trim little space dolls. And there are three of them!\"\n\n\"Come on, Astro,\" sighed Tom. \"We have to give the little boy his fun.\"\n\nThey walked toward the stand where Simms was still making his pitch to\nthe crowd.\n\n\"Just five more seats left, ladies and gentlemen, only five chances to\nblast into space ...\"\n\nTom stepped up and put three credits on the counter. \"Three, please,\" he\nsaid.\n\nSimms looked down and suddenly stopped his harangue. His eyes narrowed\nwith suspicion as he saw the three cadets standing before him.\nHesitating, he glanced around, seemingly looking for help. Then,\nshrugging his shoulders, he handed over the tickets and turned to the\ncrowd. \"Three tickets for the Space Cadets, who live out there in space.\nJust can't stay away from it, eh, boys?\"\n\n\"I only hope that tub of yours holds together,\" said Tom.\n\nSimms snarled out of the side of his mouth, \"Shut up, wise guy!\" And\nthen continued aloud, \"Yes, Space Cadet, I agree with you. Everyone\nshould take a trip into space.\"\n\nTom started to protest, but then shrugged his shoulders and followed\nRoger and Astro into the ship. On the stand, Simms continued his appeal\nto the crowd.\n\n\"Just two more tickets left, ladies and gentlemen! Who'll be the lucky\ntwo?\"\n\nSuddenly Gus Wallace appeared from behind the ship and approached the\nstand, calling, \"Hey, Simms!\"\n\nSimms stopped speaking and turned to his partner. \"Yeah?\"\n\n\"Everything's all set. Let's blast off!\"\n\n\"I'll be with you as soon as I sell the last two tickets,\" said Simms.\n\"Here you are, ladies and gents, the last two--\"\n\nWallace grabbed him by the arm and yanked him from the stand. \"I said we\nblast off, you idiot! You want to risk everything for two lousy\ncredits?\"\n\n\"O.K., O.K. Don't blow a fuse!\"\n\nSimms quickly closed the stand, turned out the lighted sign, and\nfollowed Wallace into the old freighter. He then collected the tickets\nand made sure all the passengers were strapped into their acceleration\nchairs and finally went below to the power deck. Wallace disappeared\ninto the control room and seconds later his voice was heard over the\nship's intercom gruffly announcing the blast-off. The lights in the\ncabin dimmed, the air was filled with a low whining hiss, and for an\ninstant the old ship bucked and groaned. Suddenly, with a loud explosive\nroar, she blasted into the sky and began a sluggish arching climb into\nspace.\n\n\"All right, fellas,\" said Roger, after the force of acceleration eased\noff, \"let's try a little encircling maneuver on those girls up ahead.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, Roger,\" answered Tom. \"You're flying solo on that project!\"\n\n\"Yeah, you go ahead, Romeo.\" Astro laughed. \"I'd like to see the Manning\ntechnique in action.\"\n\nA loud explosion suddenly rocked the spaceship.\n\n\"What was that?\" cried Roger. \"Maybe this old tub won't make it after\nall!\"\n\nAstro smiled. \"This is a chemical burner, remember? Her initial\nacceleration isn't enough. They have to keep blasting her to make\nspeed.\"\n\n\"Oh, sure,\" drawled Roger, relaxing again and watching the girls ahead.\n\"Well, here I go!\" He got up and lurched down the aisle running between\nthe seats.\n\n\"Hey there!\" roared Simms, who had suddenly appeared at the power-deck\nhatch. \"Keep your seat!\"\n\n\"Who, me?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"Not your Aunt Tilly, wise guy! Sit down and shut up!\"\n\n\"Listen,\" said Roger, \"you don't seem to realize--\"\n\n\"I realize you're going to sit down or else!\" snarled Simms.\n\nRoger retreated to his seat and sat down. \"Ah, go blast your jets,\" he\ngrumbled as Simms continued up the aisle to the control deck.\n\nTom and Astro doubled over with laughter. \"Welcome back, Roger,\"\nbellowed the big Venusian. \"I don't think those girls are the sociable\ntype, anyway.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't you know,\" moaned Roger, \"that space creep had to show up just\nwhen I had the whole campaign laid out in my mind.\" He gazed sadly at\nthe pert heads of the girls in front of him.\n\nTom gave Astro a wink. \"Poor Manning. All set to go hyperdrive and ran\ninto space junk before he cleared atmosphere.\"\n\nSuddenly another explosion racked the ship and the rockets cut out all\ntogether. The passengers began to look around nervously.\n\n\"By the craters of Luna, what was _that_?\" demanded Tom, looking at\nAstro.\n\n\"The rockets have cut out,\" answered the Venusian. \"Hope we're out in\nfree fall, beyond the pull of Venus' gravity.\"\n\nThe forward hatch of the passenger cabin opened and Simms reappeared\nfollowed by Wallace.\n\n\"Take it easy, folks,\" said Wallace, \"nothing to get excited about.\nWe're in free fall, holding a course around the planet. So just sit back\nand enjoy the view!\"\n\nA chorus of sighs filled the cabin and the passengers began laughing and\nchatting again, pointing out various sights on the planet below them.\nSmiling, Wallace and Simms marched down the aisle. Suddenly Roger and\nTom rose and blocked their path.\n\n\"What's up, Wallace?\" demanded Tom.\n\nWallace gave the two boys a hard look. \"So it's you, huh? You got a lot\nof nerve coming aboard this ship.\"\n\n\"If there's something wrong, Wallace,\" said Tom, \"maybe we could give\nyou a hand.\"\n\n\"Get back in your seats,\" ordered Wallace. \"We don't need any cadet\nsquirts getting in our way!\"\n\n\"Why, you overweight space jockey,\" snapped Roger, \"we know more about\nspaceships than you'll ever learn!\"\n\n\"One more crack out of you and I'll blast your ears off!\" roared\nWallace. _\"Now sit down!\"_\n\nRoger's face turned a deep red and he moved toward Wallace, but Tom put\nout a restraining hand.\n\n\"Take it easy, Roger,\" he said. \"Wallace is the skipper of this boiler.\nIn space he's the boss.\"\n\n\"You bet I'm the boss,\" snarled Wallace. \"Now keep that loud-mouthed\npunk quiet, or I'll wipe up the deck with him and send the pieces back\nto Space Academy!\"\n\n\"Hey, Wallace,\" yelled Simms, who had walked away when the argument\nstarted. \"Come on. We gotta fix that reactor unit!\"\n\n\"Yeah--yeah,\" Wallace called back. He turned to Roger again. \"Just\nremember what I said, cadet!\" Brushing the boys aside, he strode down\nthe aisle to join Simms.\n\nAs the two men disappeared through the power-deck hatch, Tom turned to\nRoger and tried to calm him down. \"Skippers are skippers, Roger, even\naboard a piece of space junk!\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" growled Roger, \"but I don't like to be called a squirt or a\npunk! Why, I know more about reactor units than--\"\n\n\"Reactor units?\" broke in Astro from his seat.\n\n\"Yeah. Didn't you hear what Simms said?\"\n\n\"But this is a chemical burner,\" said Astro. \"Why an atomic reactor unit\naboard?\"\n\n\"Might be a booster for extra speed,\" offered Tom. \"And more power.\"\n\n\"On a simple hop like this? Hardly out of the atmosphere?\" Astro shook\nhis head. \"No, Tom. It doesn't make sense.\"\n\n\"Well,\" chimed in Roger, \"here's something else I've been wondering\nabout. They charge one credit for this ride. Which makes a total of\nabout fifty credits for a capacity load--\"\n\n\"I get you,\" Tom interrupted. \"It costs at least two hundred credits in\nfuel alone to get one of these chemical jalopies off the ground!\"\n\nRoger looked at Tom solemnly. \"You know, Tom, I'd certainly like to know\nwhat those guys are doing. You just don't hand out free rides in space.\"\n\n\"How about snooping around?\" asked Astro.\n\nTom thought a moment. \"O.K. You two stay here. I'll go aft and see what\nthey're doing.\"\n\nTom walked quickly to the stern of the ship, entered the power-deck\nhatch, and disappeared. Astro and Roger, each taking one side of the\nship, strained for a look from the viewports. In a few minutes Tom\nreturned.\n\n\"Spot anything?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"I'm not so sure,\" answered Tom. \"They weren't on the power deck and the\ncargo hatch was locked. I looked out the stern viewport, but all I could\nsee was a thick black cloud.\"\n\n\"Well, that's no help,\" said Roger. Suddenly the blond cadet snapped his\nfingers. \"Tom, I'll bet they're smugglers!\"\n\n\"What?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"That's it,\" said Roger. \"I'll bet that's it. The concession is just a\nphony to cover up their smuggling. It lets them take a load of stuff up\nwithout a custom's search. Then, when they're far enough out--\"\n\n\"They dump it,\" supplied Astro.\n\n\"Right!\" agreed Tom finally. \"What better place to hide something than\nin space?\"\n\n\"For someone else to pick up later!\" added Roger triumphantly.\n\nWhen Wallace and Simms returned, the three cadets were busy looking out\nthe viewports. And later, when the spaceship was letting down over the\nexposition grounds, Tom commented on the ease with which the ship made\nher approach for a touchdown.\n\n\"Roger,\" asked Tom quietly, \"notice how she's handling now?\"\n\n\"How do you mean?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"Going out,\" said Tom, \"she wallowed like an old tub filled with junk.\nNow, while she's no feather, there's a big difference in the way she's\nmaneuvering!\"\n\n\"Then they did dump something in space!\" said Roger.\n\n\"I'm sure of it!\" said Tom. \"And from now on, we're going to keep our\neyes open and find out what it is!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\n\nTom glanced at the astral chronometer over the control board of the\n_Polaris_ and sighed with relief. It was nine P.M. He turned to the\nintercom.\n\n\"Attention, please! Attention, please! The exhibit is now closing for\nthe night. All visitors will kindly leave the ship immediately.\" He\nrepeated the announcement again and turned to smile at the last\nlingering youngster ogling him before being yanked toward an exit by a\ntired and impatient mother.\n\nThe hatch to the radar bridge opened and Roger climbed down the ladder\nto flop wearily in the pilot's seat in front of the control panel.\n\n\"If one more scatterbrained female asks me how the astrogation prism\nworks,\" groaned the blond cadet, \"I'll give it to her and let her figure\nit out for herself!\"\n\nAstro joined them long enough to announce that he had made sandwiches\nand brewed hot chocolate. Tom and Roger followed him back to the galley.\n\nSipping the hot liquid, the three cadets looked at each other without\nspeaking, each understanding what the other had been through. Even\nAstro, who normally would rather talk about his atomic engine than eat,\nconfessed he was tired of explaining the functions of the reaction fuel\nforce feed and the main valve of the cooling pumps.\n\n\"The worst of it is,\" sighed Astro, \"they all pick on the same valve.\nWhat's so fascinating about one valve?\"\n\nTom's job on the control deck was less tiring, since his was more of a\ncommand post, which demanded decisions, as conditions arose, rather than\na fixed routine that could be explained. But even so, to be asked over\nand over what the astral chronometer was, how he could read time on\nEarth, Mars, Venus, Titan, Ganymede, and all the satellites at the same\ntime was wearing on the toughest of young spirits.\n\nEager to forget the grueling day of questions and answers, the cadets\nturned their thoughts to the mysterious midnight activity that had been\ntaking place around the spaceship concession during the last ten days.\n\n\"I just can't figure out what those guys are up to,\" said Roger, blowing\non his hot chocolate. \"We've watched those guys for over a week now and\nno one has even come near them with anything that could be smuggled.\"\n\n\"Could be a small package,\" suggested Astro, his mouth full of ham\nsandwich. \"Somebody could take a ride and slip it to them.\"\n\n\"Hardly,\" said Tom. \"Remember, that ship blasts off like she's loaded to\nthe nose with cargo. And then she comes back like a feather. You can\ntell by the sound of her jets. So it wouldn't be anything small enough\nfor someone to carry.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I guess you're right,\" agreed Astro.\n\n\"Well,\" said Tom finally, \"I'm stumped. I think the only thing left to\ndo is to decide if it's anything important enough to tell Captain Strong\nabout. Working on the _Polaris_ twelve hours a day and staying up all\nnight to watch those two jokers has me all in.\"\n\nRoger and Astro looked at each other and then silently nodded their\nagreement.\n\n\"O.K.,\" said Tom, \"we'll go to the skipper's hotel in Venusport and tell\nhim the whole thing. Let's see what he makes of it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt that moment Captain Strong was in the office of Exposition\nCommissioner Mike Hawks trying to make sense out of a series of reports\nthat had landed on the commissioner's desk. Hawks watched him carefully\nas he studied the papers.\n\n\"You say this is the ninth report you've received since the fair opened,\nMike?\" asked Strong finally.\n\nHawks nodded. He hadn't known whether to laugh off or seriously consider\nthe nine space skippers' reports that the sky over the exposition site\nwas dirty.\n\n\"Yes, Steve,\" he said. \"That one came from the skipper of an express\nfreighter. He blasted off this morning and ran through this so-called\ndirt. He thought it was just a freak of nature but reported it to be on\nthe safe side.\"\n\n\"I don't suppose he took a sample of the stuff?\"\n\n\"No. But I'm taking care of that,\" replied Hawks. \"There's a rocket\nscout standing by right now. Want to come along?\"\n\n\"Let me finish these reports first.\"\n\n\"Sure thing.\"\n\nAs Strong carefully checked each report, Commissioner Hawks rose and\nbegan to stride restlessly back and forth across the spacious office. He\nstopped in front of the window and stared out over the exposition\ngrounds, watching the thousands of holiday visitors streaming in and out\nof the buildings, all unaware of the strange mystery in the sky above\nthem. Hawks' attention was drawn to the giant solar beacon, a huge light\nthat flashed straight out into space, changing color every second and\nsending out the message: \"Quis separabit homo\"--Who shall separate\nmankind?\n\nThis beacon that at the beginning of the exposition had reached into the\nblack void of space like a clean bright ray was now cloudy and\nmurky--the result of the puzzling \"dirty sky.\"\n\n\"All right, Mike,\" Strong announced suddenly. \"Let's go.\"\n\n\"Get anything more out of those reports?\" asked Hawks, turning back to\nhis desk.\n\n\"No,\" replied the Solar Guard officer. \"They all tell the same story.\nRight after blast-off, the ships ran into a dirty sky.\"\n\n\"Sounds kind of crazy, doesn't it?\"\n\n\"Crazy enough to check.\"\n\nHawks pressed a button on the desk intercom.\n\n\"Yes, sir?\" replied a metallic voice.\n\n\"Have the rocket scout ready for flight in five minutes,\" Hawks ordered.\nHe snapped off the intercom without waiting for a reply and turned to\nStrong. \"Let's go, Steve.\"\n\nThe two veteran spacemen left the office without further comment and\nrode down in the vacuum elevator to the highway level. Soon they were\nspeeding out to the spaceport in Hawks' special jet car.\n\nAt the blast-pitted field they were met by a young Solar Guard officer\nand an elderly man carrying a leather case, who were introduced as\nLieutenant Claude and Professor Newton.\n\nWhile Claude prepared the rocket scout for blast-off, Strong, Hawks, and\nNewton discussed the possibility of lava dust having risen to great\nheights from another side of the planet.\n\n\"While I'm reasonably sure,\" stated Newton, \"that no volcano has erupted\nrecently here on Venus, I can't be sure until I've examined samples of\nthis so-called dirt.\"\n\n\"I'll have Lieutenant Claude contact the University of Venus,\" said\nHawks. \"Their seismographs would pick up surface activity.\"\n\nClaude stuck his head out of the hatch and reported the ship ready for\nblast-off. Strong followed the professor and Hawks aboard and strapped\nhimself into an acceleration chair. In a moment they were blasting\nthrough the misty atmosphere of Venus into the depths of space.\n\nFifteen minutes later, Hawks and Strong were standing on the hull of the\nship in space suits, watching the professor take a sample of a dirty\nblack cloud, so thick it was impossible to see more than three feet.\nStrong called to the professor through the spacephone.\n\n\"What do you make of it, sir?\" he asked.\n\n\"I wouldn't want to give you a positive opinion without chemical tests,\"\nanswered the professor, his voice echoing in Strong's fish-bowl helmet.\n\"But I believe it's one of three things. One, the remains of a large\nasteroid that has broken up. Two, volcanic ash, either from Venus or\nfrom Jupiter. But if it came from Jupiter, I don't see how it could have\ndrifted this far without being detected on radar.\"\n\nNow, holding a flask full of the black cloud, the professor started back\nto the air lock.\n\n\"You said three possibilities, professor,\" said Strong.\n\n\"The third,\" replied the professor, \"could be--\"\n\nThe professor was interrupted by Lieutenant Claude calling over the\nintercom.\n\n\"Just received a report from the University of Venus, sir!\" said the\nyoung officer. \"There's been no volcanic activity on Venus in the last\nten years serious enough to create such a cloud.\"\n\nStrong waited for the professor's reaction, but the elderly man was\nalready entering the air lock. Before Strong and Hawks could catch up to\nhim, the air-lock hatch slammed closed.\n\n\"Hey,\" exclaimed Strong, \"what does he think he's doing?\"\n\n\"Don't worry about it, Steve,\" replied Hawks. \"He probably forgot we\nwere out here with him, he's so concerned about this dirt. We'll just\nhave to wait until he's out of the air lock.\"\n\nThe Solar Guard officer nodded, then looked around him at the thick\nblack cloud that enveloped the ship. \"Well,\" he said, \"one of the\nprofessor's theories has been knocked out.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Hawks. \"Which means this stuff is either the remains of a\nlarge asteroid or--\"\n\n\"The third possibility,\" finished Strong, \"which the professor never\nexplained.\"\n\nSuddenly the air-lock hatch opened again and the two spacemen stepped\ninside. Closing the hatch behind them, they waited until the pressure\nwas built up again to equal that of the ship, and then they removed\ntheir helmets and space suits.\n\n[Illustration: _The hatch opened again and the two spacemen entered the\nair lock_]\n\nLeaving the air lock and walking down the companionway, Hawks suddenly\ncaught Strong by the arm.\n\n\"Have you considered the possibility of this cloud being radioactive,\nSteve?\" he asked.\n\nStrong nodded slowly. \"That's all I've been thinking about since I first\nheard about it, Mike. I think I'd better report this to Commander\nWalters at Space Academy.\"\n\n\"Wait, Steve,\" said Hawks. \"If you do that, Walters might close the\nexposition. Wait until you get a definite opinion from Professor\nNewton.\"\n\nStrong considered a moment. \"I guess a few more minutes won't make a lot\nof difference,\" he said finally. He realized how important the\nexposition was to his old friend. But at the same time, he knew what\nwould happen if a radioactive cloud suddenly settled on the city of\nVenusport without warning. \"Come on. Let's see what the professor has to\nsay about this stuff.\"\n\nThey found the professor on the control deck bending over a microscope,\nstudying samples taken from the flask. He peered intently into the\neyepiece, wrote something on a pad, and then began searching through the\npages of a reference book on chemicals of the solar system.\n\nLieutenant Claude stepped up to Hawks and saluted sharply. \"Power deck\nreports they've got a clogged line, sir. It's in the gas exhaust.\"\n\nStrong and Hawks looked at each other, and then Hawks turned to the\nyoung officer. \"Send a couple of men outside to clear it.\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" said Claude, and then hesitated. \"Shall the men wear\nlead suits against possible radioactivity, sir?\"\n\nBefore Hawks could answer, Newton turned to face the three men. The\nprofessor was smiling. \"No need to take that precaution, Lieutenant. I\nnever did tell you my third opinion, did I, Captain Strong?\"\n\n\"Why, no, you didn't, sir,\" said Strong.\n\nThe professor held up a sheet of paper. \"Here's your answer. Nothing but\nplain old Venusport topsoil. Pure dirt!\"\n\n\"What?\" exclaimed Hawks hastily, reaching for the paper.\n\n\"Well, blast me for a Martian mouse,\" muttered Strong under his breath.\n\"But how?\"\n\nNewton held up his hand. \"Don't ask me how it got here. That isn't my\nline of work. All I know is that, without a doubt, the black cloud is\nnothing more than dirt. Plain ordinary dirt! And it comes from the area\nin and around Venusport. As a matter of fact, certain particles I\nanalyzed lead me to believe it came from the exposition site!\"\n\nHawks looked at Newton dumbfounded. \"By the craters of Luna, man, we're\na thousand miles over the exposition!\"\n\nThe professor was stubborn. \"I can't tell you how it got here,\nCommissioner Hawks. But I do know it's Venusian dirt. And that's final!\"\n\nHawks stared at the elderly man for a second, still bewildered. Then he\nsuddenly smiled and turned to Claude. \"As soon as that exhaust is\ncleared, blast off for Venusport, Lieutenant. I'm going to find out who\ndirtied up the sky!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTwo hours later, when Captain Strong returned to his hotel in Venusport\nwith Mike Hawks, he was surprised to see the three cadets of the\n_Polaris_ crew slumped, sleepy-eyed, on a couch in the lobby.\n\n\"What are you doing here, boys?\" he asked.\n\nThe three cadets came to attention and were wide awake immediately. Tom\nquickly related their suspicions of Wallace and Simms.\n\n\"And we've watched them every night, sir,\" Tom concluded. \"I don't know\nwhat it is, but something certainly is going on in that shack they use\nfor an office.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" agreed Astro, \"and no one is going to fool me about a rocket\nship. I know when they blast off loaded and return light.\"\n\nStrong turned to Hawks who said quietly, \"Wallace and Simms are the only\nones in this whole area that blast off regularly without a customs\nsearch.\"\n\n\"You mean,\" stammered Strong, \"Wallace and Simms are dumping\"--he could\nhardly say the word--\"_dirt_ in space?\"\n\n\"They have a ship. The cadets say the ship blasts off loaded and returns\nlight. And we've got the sky full of dirt. Venusian dirt!\"\n\n\"But why?\"\n\n\"I suggest we go out to the exposition grounds right now and ask them!\"\nsaid Hawks coldly. \"And believe me, they'd better have some\nrocket-blasting good answers!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5\n\n\nThe great educational exhibits had long been closed and only a few\nsections of the amusement park of the big exposition remained open. The\ngiant solar beacon, its brilliant colors changing every second,\nmaintained a solemn solitary watch over the exhibition buildings, while\nhere and there groups of fair visitors wandered wearily back to their\nhotels.\n\nThere was a sudden flurry of activity at the space-ride concession. Gus\nWallace and Luther Simms tumbled out of the shack and raced into their\nship. Once inside the ancient craft, they secured the hatch and turned\ntoward each other smiling broadly. Wallace stuck out his hand.\n\n\"Put 'er there, Simms. We did it!\"\n\nThe two men shook hands heartily.\n\n\"By the craters of Luna,\" said Simms, \"I thought we'd never make it! And\nif we did, that it wouldn't be there!\"\n\n\"But it was, Simms! It was! And now we've got it!\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" agreed the other. \"I never worked so hard in all my life. But\nit's worth it. Are we going to set the Solar Guard back on its ear!\"\n\nWallace laughed. \"Not only that, but think of what the boss will say\nwhen we show up with it!\"\n\n\"You know, Wallace,\" said Simms, a sly look on his face, \"we could take\nit and use it ourselves--\"\n\n\"Don't even think a thing like that!\" snapped Wallace.\n\n\"Oh, of course not,\" said Simms hurriedly. \"It doesn't pay to cross the\nboss. There's enough here for all of us.\"\n\n\"You know,\" mused Wallace, \"there's only one thing I regret.\"\n\n\"What's that?\" asked his partner.\n\n\"That I didn't get a chance to kick the space dust out of that punk,\nCadet Manning!\"\n\n\"Forget him,\" said Simms, waving his hand. \"You'll meet him again\nsomeday. Besides, why think about him, when you've got the whole\nuniverse at your finger tips?\"\n\n\"You're right. But someday I'm going to catch him and tear him apart!\"\nsnarled Wallace. \"Come on. We've got to change over to atomic drive on\nthis baby. I don't want to hang around here any longer than I have to.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Simms. \"Be pretty stupid if we're caught now!\"\n\nThe two men climbed down into the power deck and began the job of\nrefitting the freighter from chemical to atomic drive. Having already\noutfitted the vessel with atomic engines, it was a simple matter to\nchange the exhaust, reset the feed lines, and emplace the protective\nlead baffles. In an hour the two spacemen were ready to blast off.\n\n\"There she is,\" said Simms, standing back to survey their work. \"As fast\nas anything in space, except the Solar Guard cruisers on hyperdrive.\"\n\n\"O.K.,\" said Wallace. \"Let's get out of here!\"\n\nMinutes later, in a jet car speeding along the main highway toward the\nexposition grounds, Captain Strong, Mike Hawks, and the three cadets of\nthe _Polaris_ saw a rocket ship blast off. They watched it disappear\ninto the dark space above.\n\n\"That might be they,\" said Strong to Hawks. \"I'd better alert the patrol\nship near the space station and tell them to pick them up.\"\n\n\"That couldn't be Wallace and Simms, sir,\" said Astro.\n\n\"How do you know, Astro?\" asked Strong.\n\n\"That was an atomic-powered ship. The wagon Wallace and Simms have is a\nchemical job. I know the sound of her jets almost as well as I do the\n_Polaris_.\"\n\nHawks looked at Strong.\n\n\"You can depend on Astro's opinion, Mike,\" said Strong. \"He was born\nwith a rocket wrench in his hand and cut his teeth on a reactor valve.\"\n\nThey soon reached the outskirts of the exposition grounds and were\nforced to slow down as they wound their way through the darkened\nstreets. In the amusement section, the last of the whirlaway rides and\ngames of chance had closed down and only the occasional roar of a caged\nanimal in the interplanetary zoo disturbed the night.\n\nHawks drove the low, sleek jet car around the fair, taking a short cut\nthrough the outdoor mercuryball field and pulled up in front of the\n_Polaris_.\n\nThe five spacemen turned toward the concession site across the promenade\nand stopped, aghast.\n\n\"Gone!\" exclaimed Strong. \"Astro, you made a mistake! It was their ship\nwe saw blasting off. It's too late to warn the space-station patrol.\nWallace and Simms could be anywhere in space now!\"\n\n\"But, sir,\" protested Astro, \"I'm certain that an atomic-powered ship\nblasted off. And their old freighter was a chemical burner!\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Hawks resignedly, \"they're not here.\"\n\n\"Come on,\" said Strong, getting out of the jet car. \"Let's take a look\naround.\"\n\nStrong and Hawks hurried across the street to the empty lot and the\nthree cadets followed.\n\n\"Take it easy, Astro,\" said Tom, when he saw the big Venusian gripping\nhis fists in frustration. \"Anyone could make a mistake.\"\n\n\"That's just it,\" said Astro. \"I'm not mistaken! Those jokers must have\nchanged over from chemical fuel to reactant drive!\"\n\n\"But why?\" asked Roger. \"That would cost more than they could make in\nten years of hauling passengers on joy rides!\"\n\nAstro whirled around and faced the two cadets. \"I'm telling you the ship\nthat blasted off from here was an atomic drive. I don't know any more\nthan that, but I _do_ know that!\"\n\nThere was a sudden shout from Strong and the three boys hurried to the\nshack. The Solar Guard captain and the exposition commissioner were\nstanding inside and playing the beam of an electric torch around the\nwalls.\n\n\"Looks as though you were right about the atomic drive, Astro,\" said\nStrong. He flashed the light into one corner where a tangled jumble of\nlines lay on the floor. \"That's feed-line gear for a chemical burner,\nand over there\"--he played the light on some empty cartons--\"is what's\nleft of the crate's lead baffling it shipped in. They must have changed\nover to atomic drive recently.\"\n\nAstro accepted the statement with a nod. It wasn't in the nature of the\nbig cadet to boast. Now that the secret of the ship had been resolved,\nhe turned, like the others, to the question of why?\n\n\"I think the best thing we can do,\" said Strong, \"is to spread out and\nsearch the whole area. Might find something to indicate where they\nwent.\" Commissioner Hawks nodded his head in agreement.\n\nWhile Tom, Roger, and Astro searched outside, Strong and Hawks went\nthrough the drawers of the dusty desk standing in one corner.\n\n\"Nothing here but a record of the flights they made, bills for chemical\nfuel delivered, and the like,\" said Hawks at last. \"They were losing\nmoney on the operation, too. Think they might have just gotten fed up\nand pulled out?\"\n\nStrong was rummaging around in one corner of the shack. \"I'd go along\nwith that, but for one thing, Mike,\" he said. \"Take a look at this.\" He\nheld up a small cloth bag. \"There's dirt in the bottom of this bag. And\nthere are about fifty more bags in that corner.\"\n\n\"Dirt!\" exclaimed the commissioner.\n\n\"Yep,\" said Strong grimly. \"So we found out who was dumping the dirt.\nBut we still haven't found out why.\"\n\n\"Or where it came from,\" said Hawks.\n\nStrong tossed the bag into the corner. \"Well, I guess I'd better make a\nreport to Commander Walters.\"\n\nHawks moved to the corner where the pile of chemical feed-line equipment\nlay on the floor. \"Want to take a look at this stuff? Might be something\nimportant in it.\"\n\nStrong thought a moment. \"We can have the cadets do that. I want to get\nthis report off to Walters right away, and issue an order to pick up\nWallace and Simms.\"\n\n\"On what charges, Steve?\" asked the commissioner. \"I mean, what's wrong\nwith what they've done?\" The commissioner's question was based on one of\nthe cardinal rules among all Solar Guard officers of authority. \"Has the\nman committed any crime?\"\n\nSteve realized this and answered slowly. \"They've changed over to\nreactor drive without a license or permission. That's a violation of the\nspace code, section twenty-one, paragraph A. That is punishable by a\nsuspension of space papers, and if the intention proved to be willful\nneglect of the code, a year on a penal asteroid. I think we can get them\non that.\"\n\nThe captain stepped to the door and called the cadets.\n\n\"Find anything?\" he asked, when they entered the shack.\n\n\"Nothing, sir,\" replied Tom. \"Except more evidence that they changed\nover to atomic drive.\"\n\n\"That's enough\" said Strong. \"I'm going to send a report to Commander\nWalters. Is the teleceiver on the _Polaris_ hooked up, Roger?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Roger. \"But Astro will have to start up the\nauxiliary generators to give you power.\"\n\n\"Very well, then,\" said Strong. \"Corbett, you give Astro a hand on the\npower deck. And while we're gone, Manning, you go through that feed-line\njunk there in the corner and see if there's anything important in it!\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" replied Roger.\n\nStrong and Hawks, followed by Tom and Astro, left the shack and hurried\nto the _Polaris_.\n\nOn the power deck, Tom and Astro made the necessary connections on the\ngenerator, and in a few minutes, as power surged through the ship,\nStrong flipped on the teleceiver.\n\n\"Attention! Attention! This is Captain Strong on the _Polaris_ calling\nCommander Walters at Space Academy! Earth emergency circuit, priority\nB--\"\n\nIn a few moments the Solar Guard officer's call had been picked up by a\nmonitor station on Earth and relayed directly to Space Academy.\nCommander Walters was roused out of bed, and when he appeared on the\nteleceiver screen, Strong saw he was still in sleeping dress.\n\n\"Sorry to disturb you, sir,\" said Strong, \"but something has come up\nhere at the exposition that needs your immediate attention.\"\n\n\"That's quite all right, Steve,\" said the commander with a smile. \"What\nis it? Manning get into more trouble?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" answered Strong grimly. \"I wish it were as simple as that.\"\nHe quickly related the details of the strange dirt cloud and his\nsuspicions of Wallace and Simms. Walters' expression grew serious.\n\n\"I'll get out an emergency bulletin on them at once, Steve. Meantime,\nyou have full authority to head an investigation. Use any service you\nneed. I'll confirm my verbal order with official orders at once. Get on\nthis thing, Steve. It sounds serious.\"\n\n\"I will, sir, and thanks!\" said Strong.\n\n\"End transmission!\"\n\n\"End transmission,\" returned Strong, flipping off the teleceiver and\nturning to the ship's intercom. \"Attention, power deck! Corbett, you and\nAstro go back to the shack and give Roger a hand. I'm going to work with\nthe commissioner here setting up search operations.\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" replied Tom from the power deck.\n\nThe two cadets hurriedly closed the power units and left the ship.\n\n\"Did you hear what Captain Strong said, Astro?\" asked Tom. \"Search\noperations.\"\n\n\"I wonder what's up,\" the big Venusian remarked. \"They don't set up\nsearch operations unless it's awfully serious!\"\n\n\"Come on,\" urged Tom. \"Maybe Roger's found something.\"\n\nThey entered the shack together and Tom called out, \"Say, Roger, Captain\nStrong just spoke to Commander Walters at the Academy and--\"\n\nThe curly-haired cadet stopped short. \"Astro, look!\"\n\n\"By the rings of Saturn!\" exclaimed the big cadet.\n\nThe two cadets stood gaping at a huge hole in the middle of the room.\nThe wooden floor was splintered around the edges of the opening and\nseveral pieces of the chemical feed-line equipment lay close to the\nedge, with trailing lines leading down into the hole. They heard a low\nmoan and rushed up to the hole, flashing their lights down into it.\n\n\"Great galaxy!\" yelled Tom. \"Astro, look! It's a shaft! It must be a\nthousand feet deep!\"\n\n\"And look!\" bellowed Astro. \"There's Roger! See him? He's hanging there!\nHis foot's caught in that feed-line cable!\"\n\nThe big cadet leaned over the hole and shouted, \"Roger! Roger! Are you\nall right?\"\n\nThere was no answer from the shaft. Nothing but the echo of Astro's\nvoice.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6\n\n\n\"Easy, Astro,\" said Strong, standing behind the big cadet. \"Pull that\nline up slowly and gently.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" gasped Astro. He didn't have to be told to pull the rope\nwith caution. He knew only too well that the slightest jar or bump\nagainst the side of the shaft might dislodge Roger's unconscious body\nfrom the tangle of line, causing him to fall to the bottom of the shaft.\nHow far down the shaft went, none of the anxious spacemen around the\nhole in the splintered floor knew. And they didn't want to use Roger's\nbody to find out!\n\n\"I'll give you a hand, Astro,\" said Commissioner Hawks. He reached for\nthe line, but the big cadet warned him away.\n\n\"That's all right, sir,\" he said. \"He's almost up now.\"\n\nAstro pulled gently, hand over hand, until Roger's limp body was a mere\nfoot from the edge.\n\n\"Grab him, quick!\" he panted.\n\nImmediately Strong and Hawks were down on their knees at the edge of the\nhole. Each taking an arm, they pulled Roger out and laid him gently on\nthe floor of the shack. They crouched over him and began a quick\nexamination.\n\n\"How is he, sir?\" asked Tom, hovering anxiously over the still form of\nhis friend. \"Will he be all right?\"\n\nStrong didn't answer for a moment, continuing his hurried, though\ncareful check. Then he sat back on his heels and sighed in relief. \"A\nfew bruises but no broken bones, thank the universe. He's just suffering\nfrom shock. A day or so in sick bay and he'll be good as new.\"\n\n\"I'll take him over there right away, Steve,\" offered Hawks.\n\n\"Thanks, Mike,\" replied Strong. Then as he and the commissioner lifted\nthe still form of the cadet and started to carry him out of the shack,\nhe turned to Astro. \"Blast over to the _Polaris_ and call Solar Guard\nheadquarters in Venusport. Tell them to send an emergency crew down here\nright away.\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" snapped the big Venusian and dashed out of the shack.\n\nTurning back to Hawks, Strong said, \"Corbett and I will stay here and\ntry to find out where that shaft leads.\"\n\n\"All right, Steve,\" nodded the commissioner. \"Too bad we had to find out\nwhere that dirt came from the hard way.\"\n\nReaching the jet car, the two men placed Roger in the back seat, and\nHawks slid in under the wheel to start the powerful jets. Just then\nAstro, racing back from the _Polaris_, pulled up breathlessly.\n\n\"Solar Guard crew is on the way, sir,\" he reported. He glanced anxiously\ninto the back seat of the jet car.\n\n\"All right, Astro,\" said Strong gently, \"take care of Roger.\" Strong\ngestured to the back seat and without a word Astro leaped in beside his\nfriend. Hawks stepped on the accelerator and the car shot away in a roar\nof blasting jets.\n\nTom and Captain Strong watched the car disappear and then turned back to\nthe shack. Each felt the same emotion, an unspoken determination to see\nthat Wallace and Simms paid dearly for causing the accident.\n\nRe-entering the shack, they began a careful examination of the shaft.\nStrong played his emergency light down the sides, but the beam\npenetrated only a short distance.\n\n\"We'll leave a note for the emergency crew,\" said Strong. \"Our belt\ncommunicators might not work so far underground.\"\n\n\"You're going down, sir?\" asked Tom.\n\nStrong nodded. \"If necessary. Tie that valve on the end of the rope\nAstro used and lower it into the shaft. If we can touch bottom with it,\nwe'll climb down and see what Wallace and Simms were after.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Tom. He took the length of rope, tied the heavy metal\nvalve to the end, and began lowering it into the shaft. Strong continued\nto play the light down the shaft until the valve disappeared into the\ndarkness.\n\n\"Rope's getting short, sir,\" warned Tom. \"Only have about two hundred\nfeet left.\"\n\nStrong glanced at the remaining coils of line on the floor. \"I'll get\nmore from the _Polaris_, if we need it,\" he said. \"How long was that\nline to begin with?\"\n\n\"It's a regulation space line, sir,\" said Tom. \"Astro took it out of the\nemergency locker. It's about twelve hundred feet.\"\n\nBy this time the line, hanging straight down the shaft, had become\nincreasingly heavy. Suddenly it grew slack.\n\n\"I think I've hit bottom, sir,\" cried the cadet. \"But I can't pull the\nvalve back up again to make sure.\"\n\nStrong grabbed the end of the line and helped the cadet pull it back up\na short distance. Then they dropped the line again and felt a distinct\nslackening of weight.\n\n\"That's bottom all right,\" said Strong. \"Take this end of the line, run\nit out of the window on your right, and back through the one on your\nleft. Then make it fast.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Tom. He jumped out of the window, trailing the rope\nafter him, and reappeared almost immediately through the other window to\ntie a loop in the line. After checking the knot and testing the line by\nthrowing his full weight against it, Strong stripped off his jacket and\nwrapped it about the line to prevent rope burns. Then, hooking the\nemergency light on his belt, he stepped off into the shaft. Tom watched\nhis skipper lower himself until nothing but the light, a wavering pin\npoint in the dark hole, could be seen. At last the light stopped moving\nand Tom knew Strong had reached the bottom.\n\n\"Hallooooooo!\" The captain's voice echoed faintly up the dark shaft.\n\"The belt communicators don't work!\" he yelled. \"Come on down!\"\n\n\"Be right with you, sir!\" yelled Tom. He scratched a message on the\nwooden floor of the shack for the emergency crew. Then he stripped off\nhis jacket, wrapped it around the rope, secured the light to his belt,\nand stepped off into the darkness.\n\nSlowly, his hands tight around the rope through his jacket, Tom slipped\ndown the deep shaft. He kept his eyes averted from the black hole\nbeneath him, looking instead at the sides of the shaft. Once, when he\nthought he had gone about seven hundred feet, he saw that he was passing\nthrough a stratum of thick clay and could see the preserved bones of\nlong-dead mammals, protruding from the side of the shaft.\n\nFinally Tom's feet touched solid ground and he released the rope. It was\ncold in the bottom of the shaft and he hastily put his jacket back on.\n\n\"Captain Strong?\" he called. There was no answer. Tom flashed the light\naround and saw a low, narrow tunnel leading off to his left.\n\nHe walked slowly, and the newly dug sides of the tunnel seemed to close\nin on him menacingly. It was quiet. Not the blank silence of space that\nTom was used to, but the deathlike stillness of a tomb. It sent chills\nup and down his spine. Finally he stepped around a sharp bend and\nstopped abruptly.\n\n\"Captain Strong!\"\n\nThe Solar Guard officer was stooping over, his light resting on the\nground, reading something he held in his hand. He looked up at Tom and\njerked his thumb back over his shoulder. Tom flashed his light in that\ndirection.\n\n\"By the rings of Saturn!\" exclaimed Tom. There in front of him, ripped\nopen like a can of sardines, was the gleaming metal skin of the time\ncapsule! The dirt floor of the tunnel around Strong and beside the\ncapsule was littered with audio spools, sound disks, micropapers, and\nstereo slides.\n\nTom kneeled down beside his skipper and stammered, \"What--what does it\nmean, sir?\"\n\n\"It means,\" answered Strong slowly, \"that we're dealing with two of the\ncleverest men in the universe! If they've stolen what I think they have,\nthe entire Solar Guard, Solar Alliance, and just about everyone in the\nuniverse is at their mercy!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"How do you feel, Roger?\" asked Astro.\n\nThe blond-haired cadet sat up in bed, dangled his feet over the side,\nand rubbed his neck. He groaned as he moved. \"I don't think I'm going to\ndance much this month, if that answers your question. I feel like every\nbone in my body was broken!\"\n\n\"They very nearly were, Cadet Manning,\" said the medical officer,\nstanding near by.\n\n\"What happened, Manning?\" asked Commissioner Hawks.\n\n\"I really don't know, sir,\" replied Roger. \"I was moving the junk out of\nthe corner of the shack so I could examine it. I was piling it up in the\nmiddle of the floor when--wham--something gave way and I took a header\ninto nowhere!\" He looked at Astro. \"Now suppose _you_ tell me what\nhappened!\"\n\nAstro told Roger about finding him dangling at the end of the tangled\nfeed lines. Then he said, \"Tom and Captain Strong are out there now,\nwaiting for one of the Solar Guard emergency crews.\"\n\n\"Well, what are we hanging around here for?\" asked Roger, and hopped off\nthe bed. He groaned, staggered, and then straightened up. \"Nothing to\nworry about,\" he said, as Astro rushed to his side. \"I'm as good as\nnew!\"\n\n\"What do you say, Doctor?\" asked Hawks.\n\nThe doctor hesitated a moment and then smiled. \"Well, Commissioner,\nCadet Manning has several strained muscles in his back, but the best\ntreatment for that is exercise.\"\n\nHawks nodded and signed a release slip which the doctor gave him. Astro\nhelped Roger put on his space boots, and five minutes later they were\nspeeding back to the exposition grounds in the commissioner's jet car.\nAs they sped through the streets, the two cadets speculated on what they\nwould find at the bottom of the shaft. Arriving at the shack, they were\nimmediately challenged by an enlisted Solar Guardsman.\n\n\"Halt!\" said the guard gruffly. \"Advance slowly for recognition!\"\n\nWith Commissioner Hawks leading the way, Roger and Astro walked up to\nthe guard.\n\n\"Say,\" said Roger, nudging Astro, \"look at what's going on around here!\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" agreed Astro, wide-eyed. \"Something must be plenty hot to have\nguards posted!\"\n\nHawks was immediately recognized by the guard, but he still stubbornly\ndemanded proof of their identity. Hawks, Roger, and Astro hauled out\ntheir Solar Guard identification disks, small metal plates with their\nimages engraved in the shiny metal. On the other side was a detailed\ndescription of the bearer.\n\n\"Very well, sir,\" said the guard and let them pass.\n\nIn the pale light of dawn, feverish activity could be seen taking place\naround the shack. Two huge jet vans, filled with every possible piece of\nemergency equipment, were parked near by. The _Polaris_ had been taken\nover as a temporary headquarters and the area was crowded with\nscarlet-clad enlisted men. Astro could hear the hum of generators on the\n_Polaris_ and immediately felt concern for his power deck.\n\nProceeding to the shack they were again challenged by a guard and again\nhad to produce their identification disks before entering. Once inside,\nthey were amazed at the transformation. An aluminum tripod, ten feet\ntall, had been erected over the hole in the floor, and several steel\ncables, connected to a motor-driven steel drum, were looped over the\napex of the tripod, one hanging straight down into the shaft. A thick\nplastic hose hung over the edge of the shaft, jerking spasmodically as\nair was pumped into the dark hole.\n\n\"By the craters of Luna,\" cried Hawks, \"what's going on here?\"\n\nA young lieutenant stepped up to the commissioner and saluted sharply.\n\"Lieutenant Silvers, sir. Second-in-command to Captain Allison of the\nemergency crew.\"\n\nHawks returned the salute and Lieutenant Silvers continued.\n\n\"Captain Strong, Cadet Corbett, and Captain Allison are at the bottom of\nthe shaft, sir. The cage will be up in a moment and you may go down if\nyou care to.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Lieutenant,\" said Hawks.\n\n\"Congratulations, Cadet Manning,\" said Silvers. \"I understand you had a\nclose call in the shaft.\"\n\n\"I did, sir,\" said Roger. \"It was _very_ close.\"\n\nA light suddenly flashed on and the four spacemen turned to watch a\nlarge wire cage rise out of the shaft. It was built in three sections,\neach seven feet high. A ladder on one side of the cage gave easy access\nto the higher and lower levels. Astro climbed to the top section while\nHawks took the lower. Roger stepped into the center section to avoid a\nclimb. An enlisted man secured the gates and turned on the motor. The\ncage dropped through the shaft with sickening speed.\n\nA minute later it began to brake slowly, finally coming to a dead stop\nat the bottom of the shaft. They were met by a Solar Guardsman who\ndirected them into the tunnel, now illuminated by a row of flowing,\nself-powered emergency lights. Silently, but with rising excitement, the\ntwo cadets followed Hawks through the brightly lighted shaft, a thousand\nfeet below the surface of the planet.\n\nTurning the last corner in the tunnel they came upon Strong, Tom, and\nCaptain Allison huddled near the torn side of the time capsule. They\ncould hear Strong talking to Tom.\n\n\"There is a vault on every spaceship in the Solar Alliance, Tom,\" Strong\nwas explaining. \"The vault is locked before blast-off and opened after\nlanding by a light-key operated only by a trusted spaceport security\nofficer. This key flashes a series of light vibrations, in sequence,\ninto the electromagnetic lock on the vault. It's really nothing more\nthan a highly developed flashlight except that it flashes multiple\ncombinations of lights, each containing certain electronic vibrations.\nThe electromagnetic lock can only be opened with the proper combinations\nof colors and vibrations flashed by the light-key. Of course each ship\nhas a different code of colors and vibrations, but the code itself\nwouldn't be hard to crack. The big thing would be to have an adjustable\nlight-key, so that if one combination of colors and light vibrations do\nnot work, you can try another. In that way you could open any energy\nlock on any vault in the system.\"\n\n\"And Wallace and Simms--\" Tom hesitated.\n\n\"Yes, Corbett,\" said Strong grimly. \"Wallace and Simms stole an\ninformation sound spool from the capsule. On that spool was a detailed\ndescription of the energy lock and the adjustable light-key. There were\nonly seven keys in the system up to now. If we don't catch Wallace and\nSimms, there'll be eight.\"\n\n\"Great galaxy,\" Commissioner Hawks broke in. \"This will ruin the\nexposition! The Alliance will close it after--\"\n\nStrong waved a calming hand at Hawks. \"I've already spoken to Commander\nWalters at Space Academy, Mike,\" he said. \"He wants this to remain a\nsecret. No one knows about it besides us, and no one will. I'm taking\nyour oaths, your spaceman's word, that it will remain a secret. There's\nno use in starting a panic. You'll keep the exposition going as if\nnothing had happened.\"\n\n\"But what can the Solar Guard do, sir?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"We'll start the greatest search the system has ever seen,\" replied\nStrong calmly. \"But the order for their arrest will be issued for some\nother violation.\" The Solar Guard officer suddenly noticed Roger for the\nfirst time.\n\n\"Oh, Manning!\" he said, smiling. \"Good to see you. How do you feel?\"\n\n\"O.K., sir,\" replied Roger. \"But I'd feel a lot better if those space\ncrawlers didn't have the combination to every safe and vault in the\nuniverse!\"\n\nStrong nodded. \"This is one of the cleverest crimes in history. And in\nsearching for Wallace and Simms, we'll have to be twice as smart as they\nare!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Tom. \"First we have to figure out what they will do,\nand then figure out how we're going to beat them!\"\n\n\"That's right, Tom,\" nodded Strong. \"And by the stars, if we don't beat\nthem, the only safe place left for the credits and securities of the\npeople in the system will be behind rows of paralo-ray guns!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7\n\n\n\"Attention! Attention! This is Captain Maitland of the rocket cruiser\n_Orion_ reporting to Captain Strong at Space Academy. Come in, Strong!\"\n\nHigh in the Tower of Galileo overlooking Space Academy, the Solar Guard\nofficer, his face showing the strain of the last three-weeks' futile\nsearch for Wallace and Simms, flipped on the teleceiver and replied,\n\"Strong here. Go ahead, Maitland.\"\n\nTom, Astro, Roger, and Commander Walters stood behind Strong and waited\ntensely for the last report to come in. Maintland's voice crackled\nthrough millions of miles of space.\n\n\"We've searched space quadrants A through D, sections twenty-one through\none hundred thirty-eight. Constant six-way radar sweep of the area. No\nsign of Wallace and Simms.\"\n\nStrong sighed deeply and replied, \"All right, Maitland. Thank you. You\nmay return to base. End transmission.\"\n\n\"End transmission!\" signaled Maitland, and the crackling static died out\nin the quiet room.\n\nWalters stepped forward and placed his hand on Strong's shoulder. \"Don't\nlet it get you down, Steve,\" he said. \"I saw the zone search you set up\nfor those two. No one could have done more.\"\n\n\"Maybe not, sir,\" said Strong, getting up, \"but we didn't catch them.\"\n\n\"Not yet,\" frowned the commander grimly, \"but we will! Well, there's\nnothing else to do here. That was the last patrol ship to report, so you\nmight as well close up shop.\"\n\nHe turned to the cadets, who had been reassigned from the exposition as\naides to Captain Strong in his search for Wallace and Simms. \"You three\ncome with us,\" said Walters. \"I've got an idea and I want all of you to\nhear it.\"\n\nStrong and the boys followed the commander out of the Academy\ncommunications center down to his luxuriously furnished office.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Walters, settling back in his chair and lighting an\nenormous pipe filled with red Venusian tobacco, \"perhaps we have been\nhunting the fox with the wrong kind of dogs.\"\n\n\"Assuming that Wallace and Simms are the foxes in this case and the\nSolar Guard the hunting dogs, what would you suggest, sir?\" asked\nStrong.\n\nWalters puffed several times and eyed Strong. \"I was going to suggest\nthat you and the cadets become merchant spacemen for a while and take a\nlook at some of the uglier places of the Solar Alliance. Go right into\nthe foxes' den dressed as foxes!\"\n\n\"Ummmmh,\" mused Strong. \"It is an idea.\"\n\n\"Give it a try, anyway,\" urged Walters. \"Take that old freighter we\nconfiscated from the Titan smugglers, the _Dog Star_. Wander around for\na few weeks and see what you can pick up. We have the advantage, since\nonly a few of us know _why_ we're looking for Wallace and Simms. It\nmight make finding them a little easier.\"\n\nStrong looked at the cadets and then back at the commander. \"It might\njust work, at that, sir,\" he said at last.\n\n\"Work your way around to Venusport,\" said Walters. \"Let it be known that\nyou four are--well, willing to do just about anything for a credit.\"\n\nStrong and the cadets smiled. \"All right, sir,\" said the young captain.\n\"We'll start right away.\"\n\n\"No!\" replied the commander firmly. \"You'll start in the morning. Right\nnow, I'm ordering you to hit the sack and get some rest. You're not\ngoing to catch those two with speed. You'll need brains and cleverness.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir,\" said Strong as he stood up. \"And I want to thank you\nfor giving us this assignment.\"\n\n\"No question about it,\" answered the commander. \"If you have a tough job\nto do, you put your best team to work on it, and the job will get done!\"\n\nIt was difficult for the three cadets, who had been standing to one side\nlistening, to suppress a smile. They saluted and followed Strong from\nthe room. He left them at the slidestairs with orders to be ready to\nblast off at 0800 hours.\n\nTom was silent as he climbed into his bed in the _Polaris_ unit's\nquarters on the forty-second floor. Roger and Astro fell asleep almost\nas soon as their heads touched their air-foam pillows, but the\ncurly-haired cadet lay with arms under his head, staring up at the\nceiling. He felt uneasy about the task that faced them. He wasn't afraid\nfor himself, or Roger, or Astro. Something he couldn't put his finger on\nbothered the young spaceman.\n\nHe reviewed Wallace and Simms' entire operation. He remembered the two\nmen had struck him as not being too bright. Their success in stealing\nthe secret of the adjustable light-key, and their methods, plus their\ncomplete disappearance, just didn't add up. He made up his mind to speak\nto Captain Strong about it in the morning. As soon as the matter was\nsettled in his mind, he was asleep.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt exactly 0800 hours the three cadets and Captain Strong appeared at\nthe Academy spaceport dressed in the severe black tight-fitting trousers\nand jacket of merchant spacemen. Quietly eluding all friends and\nacquaintances, they entered the confiscated freighter that had been\nprepared for space flight during the night and began acquainting\nthemselves with the ship's equipment.\n\nWhen Astro reported the power deck ready and Roger cleared their course,\nTom called the traffic-control tower for blast-off clearance.\n\n\"Take it easy on the first hop,\" said Strong. \"There's no hurry and I\nwant to be sure we get this crate off in one piece.\" Smiling confidently\nat the control-deck cadet, he turned away to his quarters. He was aware\nof the effect that being left alone had on the cadets. He had learned\nearly in his associations with Tom, Roger, and Astro that they bore\nresponsibility well, and a challenge to do a good job would assure him\nthe job would be done efficiently.\n\n\"Stand by to raise ship!\" Tom's voice crackled confidently over the\nship's intercom.\n\nStrong sat on an acceleration cushion and strapped himself in. He heard\nTom's voice counting off the seconds for blast-off.\n\n\"... Five--four--three--two--one--_zero_.\"\n\nAs the rockets burst into a loud roar, the freighter lurched from the\nground and thundered up into the atmosphere, pushing Strong deep into\nhis acceleration cushion. Minutes later, he felt the freedom of\nfree-fall space. In a strange ship, the _Polaris_ crew had begun a\nstrange mission.\n\nDuring the flight to Luna City, their first stop on the tour of the\nhangouts of outlawed spacemen across the solar system, Strong briefed\nhis cadets on a plan of action.\n\n\"I think it'll be better if we split up into two teams. You work with\nme, Corbett, and Astro will team up with Manning. We'll operate like\nsimple tramp spacers. Our space papers have new last names, but the same\nfirst names, so there won't be any slip-ups when we speak to each other.\nFrom now on, if we happen to meet, you'll all call me Steve and I'll\ncall you by your first names. Is that clear?\"\n\nThe cadets nodded.\n\n\"All right,\" continued Strong. \"Now, when we arrive in a city, Tom and I\nwill go to one section, while you two go to another. Visit the\ntoughest-looking places you can find. Talk, talk to anyone that wants to\ntalk. Buy people drinks. Let it slip that you're not exactly on the\nright side of the space code. Then, if you feel you have a sympathetic\nlistener, mention Wallace and Simms. Say you have heard of the trouble\nthey're in. Say you know them, that you're old friends, and hint that\nyou have something that they need very badly. Just keep talking and\npulling for information. Got that?\"\n\nAgain the three cadets nodded silently.\n\n\"Wear your paralo-ray guns at all times and keep your belt communicators\nhidden beneath your jackets,\" Strong warned. \"If one team gets into a\ntight spot, call the other right away. But don't call unless it's\nabsolutely necessary!\" Strong paused and glanced at the tele-scanner.\n\"We're getting close to Luna City. We'll touch down at the municipal\nspaceport and go through the regular routine of customs search just to\nestablish ourselves as tramp spacemen.\"\n\n\"How long will we stay in each city, sir?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"Watch that 'sir,' Tom,\" snapped Strong. \"Might as well begin to forget\nit now.\"\n\n\"O.K., Steve,\" replied Tom sheepishly.\n\n\"To answer your question, we'll stay in each city only as long as there\nmight be something to be gained by staying. We'll live aboard the _Dog\nStar_. But stay away from the ship as much as possible. If anyone\nquestions you, tell them you're looking for cargo. But in case they take\nyou up on it and offer you a cargo haul, you always want more money for\nthe job.\"\n\nRoger grinned. \"That could be fun.\"\n\n\"Be clever, but be tough. Some of the people you'll run into are the\nmost ruthless men in the universe. They are just the ones that might\nknow something about Wallace and Simms.\"\n\nStrong cautioned them against drinking rocket juice, suggesting they\ndrink Martian water instead. The briefing was interrupted by the\nautomatic warning beep from the tele-scanner informing them that they\nhad passed the outer beacon on the approach to the municipal spaceport\non the Moon. The four spacemen immediately began the routine task of\nlanding their ship safely on the satellite colony.\n\nAn hour later, as gray-clad customs men finished searching the empty\nship, Roger waited for final clearance at the air lock of the freighter.\nWhen the last of the men were leaving the ship, Roger stopped two of\nthem.\n\n\"Say, ground hogs,\" drawled Roger, \"where's the best place to get\nsomething to eat?\"\n\nThe two men stopped and turned to face the cadet, their eyes cold and\nunfriendly. \"Why don't you space drift blast out of here?\" asked one of\nthem.\n\n\"Yeah,\" agreed the other, \"your kind aren't welcome in Luna City.\"\n\nRoger shrugged his shoulders and turned away. The two customs officers\ncontinued down the gangway. \"Those young punks,\" muttered one, \"they get\nthemselves a berth on a crummy freighter and think they're real hot\nspace aces when they're nothing but wet fire-crackers!\"\n\nStrong had appeared at Roger's side and heard the last remark.\n\n\"What was that about, Roger?\" he asked, nodding toward the disappearing\ncustoms men.\n\nRoger smiled. \"Just seeing if I could get by.\"\n\n\"They certainly gave us a good going over,\" said Strong grimly. \"I think\nour disguise is perfect. Those fellows don't miss much.\"\n\n\"I heard them talking, Steve,\" said Roger. \"They recognized the ship and\nknow its reputation for smuggling.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" agreed Strong. \"And your remark will make them sure to watch\nevery move we make. But that's just what we want. News of that sort has\na way of getting around. And anyone interested in a ship with a\nreputation for smuggling is someone we're interested in.\"\n\nAstro walked up, and with a brief nod Roger followed the big cadet down\nthe gangway. As they walked across the concrete surface of the\nspaceport, Tom appeared at Strong's elbow.\n\n\"I'm ready to go, Steve,\" he said. \"The ship's secure.\"\n\n\"Very well, Tom,\" said Strong. \"But from now on, keep your eyes and ears\nopen. It only takes one slip to make a dead spaceman!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 8\n\n\n\"See that fellow over there, Steve?\" whispered Tom. \"The one with the\nscar on his face?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" replied the disguised Solar Guard officer. \"I've been watching\nhim too. And I think he's had his eye on us.\"\n\nTom and Captain Strong were sitting in a small restaurant near the\nspaceport, drinking Martian water and discussing the shadowy characters\nthat lounged around the stuffy little room.\n\n\"I'll walk over to the bar,\" said Strong. \"Maybe he doesn't want to talk\nto two of us together. You go over and see if you can strike up a\nconversation.\"\n\n\"Good idea, sir--uh--Steve,\" said Tom.\n\nStrong got up and with an exaggerated swagger walked to the small bar.\nFrom the mirror in back of the bar, he could see Tom rise and saunter\nover to the man who sat on the opposite side of the room.\n\nFor three days, Roger, Astro, Tom, and Strong had wandered through the\nbars, restaurants, and cheap hotels of Spaceman's Row in Luna City\nsearching for information that would lead them to Wallace and Simms.\nEach night they returned to the freighter to exchange, sift, and analyze\nthe bits of information gathered, but for three nights they had come up\nwith a total of nothing. Finally, Strong had decided that this would be\nthe last night they would spend in Luna City. It was after making this\ndecision that he and Tom spotted the scar-faced man sitting alone in one\ncorner.\n\n[Illustration: _The scar-faced man obviously wanted something from Tom_]\n\nStrong saw Tom stop at the table, say a few words, then sit down and\norder drinks. Tom and the scar-faced man continued their conversation,\nnow leaning across the table talking in whispers, stopping only long\nenough for the waiter to serve the drinks. Strong noticed that the\nscar-faced man paid for them and smiled to himself. That was a step in\nthe right direction. He obviously wanted something from Tom.\n\nSuddenly the young cadet looked up and motioned for him to come over to\nthe table. Strong merely lounged against the bar and nodded carelessly.\nTaking his time, he finished his glass of Martian water, then swaggered\nacross the crowded room to the table.\n\nTom glanced up casually and then turned to his companion at the table.\n\"This is my skipper,\" he said. \"Name's Steve. You gotta job to do,\nSteve'll do it. Anything, anywhere, any time,\" he paused, and then added\nwith a smirk, \"for a _price_!\"\n\nThe scar-faced man looked up at Steve. His eyes traced a pattern over\nthe tall man, noting the broad shoulders, the piercing eyes, and the\nbulge of a paralo-ray gun in his jacket. He pushed a chair back with a\nfoot and managed a smile in spite of the scar that twisted his features\ninto an ugly mask. \"Sit down, Steve. My name's Pete.\"\n\nStrong accepted the invitation silently. At close range, he saw the man\nwas more disfigured than he had noticed from the bar. The scar on his\nface reached from his left ear across his cheek and down to his neck.\nPete saw him looking at the scar and smiled again. \"Funny thing about\nscars. I got one, but I don't have to look at it. I just stay away from\nmirrors and I remember myself as I was before I got it. So look all you\nwant. You're the one that's got to suffer for it.\"\n\nIgnoring the man's bitter tone of voice, Strong growled, \"I'm not\ninterested in what you look like. You got something to haul; we got a\nship to haul it. Name your cargo and destination, and we'll name a\nprice.\"\n\n\"Ain't as simple as that,\" said Pete craftily. \"I gotta know more about\nyou before we talk business.\"\n\n\"What for instance?\" asked Strong.\n\n\"For instance, who do you know on Spaceman's Row that can give you a\nreference?\"\n\nTom spoke up quickly without looking at Strong. \"Suppose I told you I\nhelped pull a job a couple of weeks ago that was worth a hundred\nthousand credits?\" He settled back, casually glancing at Strong and\nreceiving an imperceptible nod in return.\n\n\"A hundred thousand, eh?\" said Pete with interest. \"Not bad, not bad.\nWhat kind of a job was it?\"\n\n\"Me and two other guys held up the Credit Exchange at the Solar\nExposition at Venusport.\"\n\n\"Oh?\" Pete was becoming extremely curious. \"You in on the job too,\nSteve?\"\n\nBefore Strong could answer, Tom spoke quickly. \"No, I bought a half\ninterest in Steve's ship with my share of the take.\" Strong could hardly\nkeep from smiling, so easily was the young cadet's tale growing.\n\n\"Then who _was_ in on this job with you?\" persisted the scar-faced man.\n\"You look pretty young to pull a big job like that.\"\n\nTom glanced around the room and then leaned over the table before\nwhispering, \"Gus Wallace and Luther Simms.\"\n\n\"What?\" exclaimed Pete. \"Gus Wallace? A guy about six feet tall and two\nhundred pounds? Has a heavy rough voice?\"\n\n\"That's the one,\" said Tom.\n\nPete's arm shot across the table like a snake and he grabbed Tom by the\njacket. \"Where is he?\" he asked through clenched teeth.\n\nNo sooner had Pete touched Tom than Strong had his paralo-ray gun\nleveled at the scar-faced man. \"Take your hands off him,\" he said\ncoldly, \"or I'll freeze you right where you are!\"\n\nPete relaxed his grip and settled back into his chair. He glared at Tom\nand then at Strong.\n\n\"All right,\" snapped Strong. \"Now _you_ talk!\"\n\nPete didn't say anything. Strong inched closer to the scar-faced man\nmenacingly. \"I said _talk_! Why do you want to know where Gus Wallace\nis? Maybe you're Solar Guard, eh? Trying to play a little trick on us.\nHow do I know you haven't got a squad of MP's outside waiting to pick us\nup?\"\n\nPete began to shift nervously. \"You got me all wrong, Steve. I ain't\nSolar Guard.\"\n\n\"Why do you want to know where Gus Wallace is, then?\" Strong persisted.\n\nPete hesitated and had to be prodded with the paralo-ray gun again by\nStrong. \"Talk!\" hissed Strong.\n\n\"You see this scar?\" asked Pete. \"Well, two years ago, on Spaceman's Row\nin Marsopolis, Gus slashed me in a fight. I swore I'd do the same for\nhim when I caught him, but he's been running from me ever since.\"\n\n\"Marsopolis, eh?\" asked Strong. \"Two years ago?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"I think you're lying! You're Solar Guard.\"\n\n\"Honest, Steve,\" whined Pete. \"That's the only reason I want him. Ask\nanybody. It happened in the Spacelanes Bar on New Denver Avenue. I bet\nthere are five guys here right now who heard about it!\"\n\nStrong got up, pushing the gun back in his belt.\n\n\"Come on, Tom. I don't like the way your friend Pete answers questions.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute!\" Pete rose from his chair, protesting.\n\nStrong whirled around and faced the scar-faced man. \"If I were you,\nPete,\" he muttered, \"I'd sit still and not ask any more questions. It\nisn't healthy!\"\n\nWithout another word Strong walked out of the dingy restaurant. Tom\nshrugged his shoulders in a helpless gesture and followed, leaving Pete\nalone and worried.\n\nOutside in the street, his face bathed in the garish light of the vapor\nstreet lights, Strong stopped to wipe his forehead.\n\n\"Whew!\" he gasped. \"We certainly bulled our way through that one!\"\n\n\"I felt the same way,\" said Tom. \"But at least we have something to go\non. You think he was suspicious?\"\n\n\"No, Tom. He was so scared when I accused him of being tied up with the\nSolar Guard it threw him completely off stride.\"\n\n\"Well? Where do we go from here?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"Back to the ship,\" replied Strong. \"And as soon as Astro and Roger show\nup, we blast off for Marsopolis. Our next target is a joint called the\nSpacelanes!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAgainst a backdrop of shimmering stars that studded the velvet black\nemptiness of space, the freighter _Dog Star_ rocketed toward the red\nplanet of Mars carrying the four spacemen on the next step of their\nsearch. Relaxing from the three arduous days on the Moon and able to be\nthemselves once more, Strong and the three cadets rested and discussed\nevery detail of their stay in Luna City. It was finally decided that\ntheir only real chance of tracing Wallace and Simms lay in the\nSpacelanes Bar. As they approached Mars, Strong outlined their next\nmove.\n\n\"We'll do the same thing as we did in Luna City,\" he said. \"Split up.\nOnly this time, we'll all go to the same place, the Spacelanes. Tom and\nI will go in first and do most of the nosing around. Astro and Roger\nwill drift in later and hang around, just in case there's trouble.\"\n\nThe three cadets nodded their understanding, and when Strong turned to\nthe teleceiver to make his report to Commander Walters at Space Academy,\nthey took their stations for touchdown at Marsopolis.\n\nHis face impassive on the teleceiver screen, Commander Walters listened\nto Strong's report, and when the Solar Guard officer finished, he\ngrunted his satisfaction.\n\n\"Do you have any news on Wallace and Simms, sir?\" asked Strong.\n\n\"Yes, but my news isn't as good as yours,\" frowned Walters. \"They've\nalready made use of their knowledge of the light-key. They held up a\nSolar Guard transport en route to Titan and emptied her armory. They\ntook a couple of three-inch atomic blasters and a dozen paralo-ray guns\nand rifles. Opened the energy lock with their adjustable light-key as\neasily as if it had been a paper bag. It looks as though they're setting\nthemselves up for a long siege.\"\n\n\"Do you have any idea where they might be hiding, sir?\"\n\n\"Somewhere in the asteroid belt, I believe,\" replied the commander.\n\"They headed for the belt after they held up the transport.\"\n\n\"Well, we'll do what we can from our end, sir,\" said Strong. \"Since Mars\nis closer to the asteroid belt than any other planet, they might be\nusing Marsopolis as a hangout. Or someone might have seen them\nrecently.\"\n\n\"Use whatever plan you think best, Steve. I'm counting on you.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir.\"\n\n\"Spaceman's luck! End transmission.\"\n\n\"End transmission,\" replied Strong and flipped off the screen.\n\nFifteen minutes later, the _Dog Star_ settled on a blast-scorched ramp\nat the Marsopolis spaceport, and after a hasty review of their plans,\nthe four spacemen left the ship. Strong had a brief argument with a\ncustoms officer over a personal search for small arms. They were forced\nto leave their paralo-ray guns on the ship. Disgruntled, as far as the\ncustoms agents were concerned, Strong was actually pleased with the\nsuccess of their disguise as merchant spacemen.\n\nTom and Strong found the Spacelanes Bar in the roughest and darkest\nsection of Marsopolis. It was large and almost empty. But Tom noted that\nit was just like many other such places he had been in in Luna City. The\nwalls were scarred and dirty, the floor littered, and the tables and\nchairs looking as if they had been used in a hundred fights. Behind a\nbar that ran the length of one wall, a heavy-set man with beady black\neyes watched their approach.\n\n\"What's your pleasure, spacemen?\" asked the bartender in a gruff voice.\n\nStrong hesitated a moment and decided to play all his cards at one turn.\n\"We'll have a thousand credits worth of information.\"\n\nThe barman's eyes narrowed into black slits. \"What kind of information\nwould bring that kind of a price?\" he asked.\n\n\"Information about a man,\" said Strong.\n\n\"What man?\" asked the barman. He dropped his hand out of sight behind\nthe bar. Tom's eye caught the move and he wished the customs men hadn't\ntaken away their paralo-ray guns.\n\nJust at that moment he heard Roger's unmistakable laugh and turned to\nsee the blond cadet, followed by Astro, enter, cross the room, and slap\nthe bar for service.\n\n\"Let me take care of these two,\" muttered the bartender and walked down\nto the end of the bar. Facing Roger and Astro, he snarled, \"What'll it\nbe?\"\n\n\"Coupla bottles of Martian water,\" drawled Roger.\n\n\"Get out of here,\" roared the bartender. \"We don't sell kids' drinks in\nhere.\"\n\n\"Two bottles of Martian water!\" growled Astro and leaned over the bar\nthreateningly. Strong and Tom watched the performance with amused eyes.\nWithout a word, the barman opened the bottles of Martian water and gave\nthem to Roger and Astro. He turned back to Strong.\n\n\"These young rocketheads think they're so blasted tough,\" he sneered,\n\"and then drink kids' soda pop.\"\n\nStrong looked at Roger and Astro. \"That fellow on the right,\" indicating\nAstro's size, \"looks like he could be a little more than a child, if he\ngot mad.\"\n\nThe barman snorted and leaned over the bar. \"What about that thousand\ncredits?\" he asked.\n\n\"What about it?\" countered Strong.\n\n\"That's a lot of money just for information,\" said the barman.\n\n\"It's my money,\" replied Strong coolly, \"and my business!\"\n\n\"What kind of information you interested in,\" asked the bartender.\n\n\"I told you, information about a man,\" said Strong. \"Gus Wallace. Happen\nto know him?\" Strong pulled a roll of crisp credit notes out of his\njacket pocket. The barman looked at them greedily.\n\n\"Maybe. What'cha want with him?\" he asked.\n\n\"He knifed a friend of ours in here two years ago.\"\n\n\"Yeah?\" drawled the barman. \"Who?\"\n\n\"Pete,\" answered Strong, suddenly realizing he didn't know the\nscar-faced man's last name.\n\n\"Pete? Pete who?\" asked the barman craftily.\n\n\"What are you trying to do?\" snapped Tom suddenly. \"Play space lawyer?\nYou know Pete was knifed in here by Gus Wallace two years ago! Carved up\ngood!\" He made a slashing gesture from his ear to his throat, indicating\nthe scar on Pete's face.\n\n\"So you want Wallace, eh?\" mused the bartender.\n\n\"We want him a thousand credits' worth,\" said Strong.\n\n\"You didn't tell me for what, yet.\"\n\n\"None of your space-blasting business,\" roared Strong. \"You want the\nthousand or not?\"\n\nThe bartender couldn't keep his eyes off the crisp roll of credit notes\nStrong rippled under his nose and hesitated. \"Well, to tell you the\ntruth, I ain't seen him for a long time.\"\n\n\"Then do you know anyone who has?\" asked Strong.\n\n\"Hard to tell,\" said the bartender huskily. \"But I do know the guy who\nwould know if anyone does.\"\n\n\"Who?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"On Venusport's Spaceman's Row. There's a joint called the Caf\u00e9 Cosmos.\nGo there and ask for a little guy named Shinny. Nicholas Shinny. If\nanyone knows about Wallace, he'll know.\"\n\nTom's heart almost stopped. Nicholas Shinny was a retired spaceman who\nhad taken part in his last adventure to Alpha Centauri, and was a good\nfriend of Strong's and the _Polaris_ unit. Shinny had always operated on\nthe edge of the space code. Nothing illegal, but as Shinny himself put\nit, 'just bending the code a little, not breaking it.'\n\nTom spoke up. \"That's only worth a hundred credits,\" he said.\n\n\"Whaddya mean!\" snapped the barman.\n\n\"How would Nick Shinny know Gus Wallace?\" asked Strong.\n\n\"They prospected the asteroids together years ago.\"\n\nStrong dropped a hundred-credit note on the bar and turned away without\nanother word. Tom followed, and as they passed Roger and Astro, a\nknowing look passed between them, and Tom gestured for them to follow.\n\nHaving heard the conversation, Astro and Roger walked over to the\nbartender who was folding the credit note before putting it in his\npocket.\n\n\"You sell your information pretty cheap, spaceman,\" snarled Roger.\n\"Suppose those two were Solar Guardsmen in disguise?\"\n\nThe bartender paused, then shook his head. \"Couldn't be!\" he said.\n\n\"Why not?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"Because the Solar Guard has a guy salted away that knows exactly where\nWallace is.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 9\n\n\n\"That's the story, sir,\" said Strong to Commander Walters, after the\nSolar Guard captain had related the information he had wormed out of the\nbartender at the Spacelanes Bar and the news Roger and Astro had\nbrought.\n\n\"All right, Steve,\" nodded the commander. \"I'll have the man picked up\nright away and psychographed. Meantime, you go on to Venus and see\nNicholas Shinny.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir,\" said Strong. \"End transmission!\"\n\n\"End transmission,\" acknowledged Walters. Strong flipped the switch and\nthe teleceiver screen darkened.\n\nFifteen minutes later, the _Dog Star_ blasted off from Mars, heading for\nVenus.\n\nDuring the trip back to the young planet that was rapidly growing into a\nmajor industrial center rivaling Earth, Strong received a report from\nSpace Academy that the bartender had been picked up. His name was Joseph\nPrice, and after questioning him under truth serum, Solar Guard security\nofficers found the man's mind to be so filled with criminal plots and\ncounter-plots, it would take several weeks for the psychograph analyst\nto learn the name of the man he claimed would know the whereabouts of\nWallace. This was disappointing news for Strong, especially since the\nreport included news of a second, third, and fourth strike by Wallace\nand Simms on spaceships near the asteroid belt.\n\nReaching the starting place of their adventure, Venusport and the Solar\nExposition, Strong and the three cadets went immediately to a small\nsuburban section of the great city and the home of Nicholas Shinny.\n\nShinny lived comfortably in a small house made of Titan crystal,\nenjoying himself during the day catching Venusian fatfish and watching\nthe stereos at night. Once an enlisted spaceman, he had been retired\nwith full pension and was living in ease and comfort. When Strong and\nthe three cadets arrived at the elderly spaceman's house, they found him\nbusy teaching a young Venusian wolfhound puppy how to retrieve.\n\n\"Well, blast my jets!\" cried the old man. \"If it ain't Tommy, Roger, and\nthe big fella, Astro! And Captain Strong!\"\n\n\"Hello, Nick!\" said Strong with a smile. \"You're a sight for space-blind\neyes!\"\n\n\"Heh-heh-heh,\" cackled Shinny, his merry eyes twinkling against his deep\nspace tan. \"It's mighty good to see you boys. Come on in the house. I\ngot a mess of fatfish just pulled out of the stream and some of the most\ndelicious biscuits you ever had in your life!\"\n\n\"Well, thanks, Nick,\" hesitated the captain. \"But we're in--\"\n\n\"Can't be in too much of a hurry to eat,\" snapped the old man with a\ngrin. \"Anything you got to say is better said when you got a bellyful of\nMolly's cookin'.\"\n\n\"Molly!\" cried Tom. \"But, Mr. Shinny--\"\n\n\"When--\" gulped Astro, \"when did you--\"\n\n\"Hey! Hold on!\" cried the old spaceman. \"Just damp your tubes there,\nyoungsters! You're way off course. Molly ain't nothing but an electronic\ncook I got installed in the kitchen. She cooks better'n any\nspace-brained woman and she never opens her mouth to give me any sass!\"\n\nThe four spacemen laughed at Shinny's obvious indignation.\n\n\"Now come on!\" he growled. \"Let's eat. I'm hungry!\"\n\nRefusing to allow them to get near Molly, Shinny began pushing food into\nslots, compartments, turning on switches and punching buttons. In the\ncozy living room, Strong relaxed while the three cadets played with the\nVenusian wolfhound. Finally Shinny announced dinner and they fell to\nwith gusto. There wasn't much talk during the course of the meal. Strong\nand the boys felt that Shinny would let them know when he was ready.\n\nFinally the meal was over. Shinny sprawled in his chair, lit his pipe,\nthen looked at his guests, his eyes twinkling. \"All right, me friends, I\nthink you've held back long enough. Let's have it.\"\n\nStrong immediately told the old spaceman the entire story, from Wallace\nand Simms' false concession at the exposition to the present.\n\n\"You see, Nick,\" he concluded, \"with an adjustable light-key enabling\nthem to open any lock in the solar system, nothing is safe. Personally,\nI think it's only because they haven't a larger or faster ship and\naren't better armed that they haven't tried more daring piracy. They'll\nreach that point soon, though. They've already robbed four ships for\narms alone.\"\n\n\"I'll do anything I can to help you, Captain,\" said Shinny. \"What is it\nyou want to know?\"\n\n\"We suspect that Wallace has a secret hide-out in the asteroid belt,\"\nsaid Strong. \"Since you once prospected the asteroids with him I thought\nyou might know where the hide-out is.\"\n\nShinny grew reflective and knocked the ashes out of his pipe before he\nanswered. \"That was a long time ago, Captain. More'n ten years. And Gus\nWallace was a real square spaceman then. He didn't turn bad until after\nwe split up and he met that other feller.\"\n\n\"What other fellow?\" asked Strong.\n\nSkinny paused. There was a hard glint in his eyes. \"Bull Coxine!\" He\nspat the name out as though it had left a bad taste in his mouth.\n\n\"Coxine!\" exclaimed Strong.\n\n\"You heard me,\" snorted Shinny. \"Bull Coxine and Gus Wallace got\ntogether after me and Wallace lost our stake hunting for uranium\npitchblende in the asteroids and split up. Next thing I heard, him and\nCoxine was mixed up in that business up on Ganymede when the Credit\nExchange was held up.\"\n\nStrong's face had turned the color of chalk. \"Coxine!\" he repeated under\nhis breath.\n\nNoticing Strong's reaction to Shinny's statement, Tom asked, \"Who is\nCoxine, Captain Strong?\"\n\nStrong was silent and Shinny turned to the cadets.\n\n\"When your skipper here was a young feller just starting out in the\nSolar Guard,\" the old man explained, \"he was on a routine flight out to\nTitan and there was a mutiny. Coxine was the ringleader. The captain\njoined up with Coxine after they had put his skipper in the brig. When\nhe had Coxine's confidence, he regained control of the ship and sent\nCoxine and the others to a prison asteroid. Coxine has hated the captain\never since and swore to get him.\"\n\n\"But how did he pull the holdup on Ganymede, then?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"Coxine escaped from the prison asteroid in a jet boat, disguised as a\nguard,\" continued Shinny. \"Only man ever to escape. He drifted around in\nthe belt for a while and was picked up by a freighter going to Ganymede.\nThe freighter had been out rocket-hopping among the asteroids,\ncollecting the prospectors' small supplies of uranium and taking the\nstuff back to Ganymede for refining. Wallace happened to be dead-heading\non the freighter. When they got to Ganymede, and Coxine saw all the\nmoney lying around at the Credit Exchange to pay off the prospectors, he\nconvinced Wallace to go in with him and they robbed the Exchange. Coxine\nwas caught red-handed, but Wallace got away. In fact, the Solar Guard\ndidn't know Wallace had anything to do with it. So Coxine was taken back\nto the prison asteroid, and Wallace has been driftin' around the system\never since.\"\n\n\"But, Mr. Shinny,\" asked Astro, \"if you knew Wallace was tied up with\nthe robbery of the Credit Exchange, why didn't you tell the Solar Guard\nbefore now?\"\n\n\"Sonny,\" sighed Shinny, \"most of what I know is space dust and space\ngas. But even so, I don't think Commander Walters or Captain Strong, or\neven you boys, would think much of me if I went around like an old space\ncrawler, blowin' my jets all over the place.\"\n\nStrong had listened to Shinny fill in the background of Bull Coxine with\na thoughtful look in his eyes. He remembered all too clearly the mutiny\non the ship out to Titan. Coxine had been an enlisted Solar Guard petty\nofficer aboard the ship. He had made great strides in two years and was\nbeing considered as an officer candidate on the very day he tried to\ntake over the ship. When Strong regained control later, he talked to\nCoxine, trying to find out why he had started the mutiny. But the man\nhad only cursed him, swearing vengeance. Strong hadn't seen him since.\n\n\"So you think he would know where Wallace and Simms might be hiding\nout?\" Strong asked finally.\n\n\"If anyone does,\" replied Shinny, \"he does. And I'll tell you this,\nCaptain, if you go to talk to him and I figger you will, you'll find him\na lot tougher.\"\n\n\"Will I?\"\n\n\"Well, take yourself, for instance. No reflection on you, of course, but\ntake yourself. You're smart, you're hard, and you got a good mind.\nYou're one of the best spacemen in the deep. Take all that and turn it\nbad. Real bad. Sour it with too many years on a prison asteroid and\nyou've got a fire-eating rocket buster as tough and as rough as God and\nsociety can make him!\"\n\nThe three cadets gulped and looked at Strong. They saw their skipper\nclench his teeth and ball his fists into tight knots.\n\n\"I know,\" said Strong in a hoarse whisper, \"but if he knows where\nWallace and Simms are, he'll tell me. You can bet your last credit,\nhe'll tell me!\"\n\nShinny paused reflectively. \"I won't bet,\" he said simply.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe air inside the space shack was stale because of a faulty filter in\nthe oxygen circulator that neither Wallace nor Simms bothered to clean.\nThe two men lazed around in stocking feet and undershirts, listening to\npopular music coming over the audio receiver on a late pickup from one\nof the small Jovian satellite colonies near by.\n\n\"Pour me another cup of coffee, Simms,\" grunted Wallace.\n\nThe smaller man poured a cup of steaming black liquid and silently\nhanded it over to his companion. They both listened as the music faded\nto an end and the voice of the announcer crackled over the loud-speaker.\n\n\"This audiocast has been beamed to space quadrants D through K, as a\ncourtesy to the army of uranium prospectors working the asteroid belt.\nHope you've enjoyed it, spacemen, and happy hunting!\"\n\nWallace reached over and snapped off the receiver. \"Thanks, pal.\" He\nlaughed. \"The hunting's been real good! We've got a full catch!\" The\ngiant spaceman laughed again.\n\n\"Yeah,\" agreed Simms. \"I just went over the take. We've got enough money\nin that locker\"--he indicated a black box on the floor--\"to sit back and\ntake it easy for the rest of our lives.\"\n\n\"Yeah?\" snarled Wallace. \"You mean sitting in the sun on a crummy\nlakeside, watching the birds and bees?\"\n\n\"Gus,\" asked Simms thoughtfully, \"you got any idea how much fun we can\nbuy with the credits in that box?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I have!\" sneered Wallace, \"and I know what a thousand times that\nmuch will buy too!\"\n\nSuddenly Simms turned and looked his partner in the eye. \"What do you\nsay we quit now, Gus? I mean it. We got plenty.\"\n\n\"You sound like you been exposed to too many cosmic rays!\" said Wallace,\ntapping his head with one finger. \"We've got the biggest secret in the\nsystem, the adjustable light-key plus an airtight hide-out, and you want\nto quit!\"\n\n\"It ain't that,\" whined Simms. \"It's the other deal. I don't mind going\nout and blasting a few freighters, but to try to--\"\n\n\"Lissen,\" interrupted Wallace, \"I'd rather try it and take the licking\nif we mess it up, than not try it and take that licking. I know which\nside of the space lane I'd better be on when the time comes!\"\n\nSimms hesitated and then sighed, \"Yeah, I guess you're right.\"\n\n\"Come on. Let's listen to that story spool again.\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" moaned Simms. \"I know that spool by heart! We've heard it at\nleast fifty times!\"\n\n\"One slip-up,\" said Wallace, sticking his finger in Simms' face, \"just\none slip-up and we're finished! We've got to be sure!\"\n\nWith a reluctant shrug of his shoulders, Simms poured another cup of\ncoffee and sat on the side of his bunk while Wallace inserted the story\nspool in the audio playback.\n\nThey settled themselves and listened as a deep voice began to speak in a\nloud whisper.\n\n\"... The operation will take place on the night of October twenty-ninth\nat exactly twenty-one hundred hours. You will make your approach from\nsection eleven, M quadrant--\"\n\nSimms jumped up abruptly and switched off the playback. Turning to\nWallace, he pleaded, \"I can't listen to it again! I know it by heart.\nInstructions on how to get to the time capsule; instructions on what to\ntake, and how to build an adjustable light-key after we get the plans;\ninstructions on how to hijack the first ship and what to take. Orders,\ninformation, instructions! I'm sick of listening. If you want to, go\nahead, but I'm going to work on the ship!\"\n\n\"O.K., O.K.,\" said Wallace, getting up. \"Don't blow your jets. I hate\nthe thing as much as you do. Wait a minute and I'll go with you.\"\n\nThe two men began climbing into space suits. In a few minutes they were\ndressed in black plastic suits with small round clear plastic helmets.\nThey stepped into the air lock on one side of the room and closed a\nheavy door. Wallace adjusted the valve in the chamber and watched the\nneedle drop until it showed zero.\n\n\"O.K.,\" said Wallace over his helmet spacephones. \"All the air's out.\nOpen the outer lock.\"\n\nSimms cranked the heavy handle, and the door in the opposite wall of the\nchamber slowly swung open. They stepped out into the airless black void\nof space and onto the surface of an asteroid, drifting in the thickest\npart of the belt. Surrounding the asteroid were countless smaller\nsecondary satellites circling the mother body like a wide curving\nblanket. The mother body was perfectly hidden from outside observation.\nIt made a perfect base of operations for the two space pirates.\n\nThe freighter that they had used at the concession at the Solar\nExposition and later to make their escape was a far different ship from\nthe one now resting on the asteroid. Two powerful three-inch atomic\nblasters could be seen sticking out of the forward part of the ship. And\nnear the stern, two gaping holes showed the emplacements for two\nadditional guns not yet installed.\n\nThe two men walked over to the ship, and while Wallace entered the ship,\nSimms picked up a cutting torch and ignited it, preparing to finish the\ntwo holes in the stern.\n\nWhen Wallace reappeared, he was carrying a coil of wire with a double\nplug to attach to the spacephones inside their helmets. He jammed the\nplug into Simms' helmet and then into his own. Simms' eyes lit up with\nsurprise as he heard....\n\n\"...This is a general emergency announcement from Solar Guard\nheadquarters. Squadrons A and B of the Marsopolis garrison will proceed\nto space quadrants W, sections forty-one to fifty. It is believed that\nGus Wallace and Luther Simms are in that vicinity. Approach with\ncaution, they are armed with atomic blasters and are believed to be\npsychologically unable to surrender. It is believed they will resist\narrest....\"\n\nThe voice repeated the announcement and added a general call for the\nmen, if they were listening, to surrender. Wallace pulled out the two\nplugs and grinned at Simms.\n\n\"Picked it up on the teleceiver inside the ship. Thought you might like\nto know how safe we are here.\"\n\nSimms grinned back, \"And how far off the track they are. Where is that\nspace quadrant they think we're in?\"\n\n\"Out past Saturn,\" said Wallace with a grin. \"With the Mars garrison\nchasing us at one end of the system, we'll hit them on the other and be\ngone before they know what happened!\"\n\nSimms patted the barrel of the nearest atomic blaster. \"And, spaceman,\nwe're going to hit them hard!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 10\n\n\n\"Stop your ship and be recognized!\"\n\nThe rasping voice on the audioceiver was sharp. A command to be obeyed.\n\nTom turned away from the control board and looked at Strong who was\nalready reaching for the ship's intercom.\n\n\"Full braking rocket thrust, Astro,\" he yelled into the microphone, \"and\nmake it quick or we'll all be blasted into protons!\"\n\nTom and the captain gripped their chairs tightly as the ship bucked\nagainst the deceleration force of the powerful braking rockets.\nGradually the freighter _Dog Star_ slowed and came to a dead stop in\nspace.\n\n\"Hey!\" yelled Astro over the intercom from the power deck. \"What's going\non up there?\"\n\n\"We've just entered the outer circle of defense on the prison asteroid,\nAstro,\" replied Strong. \"We have to stop so they can sweep us with their\nradar and identify the ship.\"\n\n\"But I sent them a message in Solar Guard code that we were coming,\"\ninterjected Roger who was listening from the radar bridge.\n\n\"They still have to make sure it's us,\" said Strong.\n\n\"Identify yourselves!\" commanded the voice over the audioceiver again.\n\n\"This is space freighter _Dog Star_ under temporary command of Captain\nStrong of the Solar Guard,\" answered Strong.\n\n\"What's your business here?\" demanded the voice again.\n\n\"Interrogation of one of your prisoners. We have sent a coded message,\nunder code Z for Zebra to your prison commandant, Major Alan Savage. If\nyou'll check with him, you'll find everything in order,\" said Strong.\n\n\"Very well,\" replied the voice crisply, and then added, \"Remain where\nyou are. Do not move from your present position or attempt to send any\nmessages. If you fail to comply with these conditions you will be\nblasted!\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Strong, \"conditions are understood.\"\n\n\"Boy,\" chimed in Roger, as he climbed down the ladder from the radar\nbridge, \"they sure don't want any company here.\"\n\n\"And for good reason,\" said Strong. \"The most vicious criminals in the\nwhole universe are confined here. Every one of them is capable of\ncommitting any crime in the solar code. And most of them have. The men\nhere are the worst. They have refused psychotherapeutic readjustment to\nmake them into new men.\"\n\n\"But I thought they had to go through it, sir?\" said Tom.\n\n\"No,\" replied Strong. \"Even criminals have certain rights in our\nsociety. They can either remain criminals and stay here, or be\npsychoadjusted and given new personalities. The ones that refuse are the\nones on this Rock.\"\n\n\"You mean,\" gasped Roger, \"that the men on this asteroid deliberately\nchose to remain criminals?\"\n\n\"Yes, Manning,\" said Strong. \"Rather than become healthy citizens of the\nsystem, they prefer to stay here and waste their lives in isolation with\nno hope of ever returning to society.\"\n\n\"Can they change their minds after they get here?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"Any time. But when they get this far, they usually stay here. The men\non Prison Rock didn't surrender easily. They are the toughest, most\nruthless men in the universe.\"\n\n\"Attention! Freighter _Dog Star_! Attention!\" the audioceiver rasped\ninto life again. \"You have been given temporary clearance. A space\nlaunch will ferry you to the asteroid. You are warned that any weapons\ndiscovered on your person, or acts that may be construed as providing\naid and comfort to the inmates of this prison, will be considered\ntreason against the Solar Alliance and you will be subject to immediate\ndisciplinary action.\"\n\nTom and Roger glanced at each other, a worried look in their eyes.\nStrong just smiled. \"Don't worry, boys. That little speech is read to\nevery visitor to the asteroid.\"\n\n\"Just the same, sir,\" said Roger huskily, \"I would prefer to remain\naboard the _Dog Star_ and give you, Tom, and Astro the pleasure of the\nvisit.\"\n\nStrong laughed. \"They won't let you, Roger. They'll send up a crew of\nguards to search the ship. And the way these boys search makes a customs\ninspection look like a casual glance.\"\n\n\"Attention _Dog Star_!\" A younger voice suddenly came in on the\naudioceiver. \"This is Lieutenant Williams aboard the space launch. We\nare approaching your starboard catapult deck. Please open the air lock\nand take us aboard.\"\n\n\"They sure don't waste any time,\" commented Tom as he turned to the\naudioceiver. \"Freighter _Dog Star_, Cadet Tom Corbett to Lieutenant\nWilliams,\" he called, \"the air lock is open and the catapult deck is\nready to receive you.\" At the same time, the young cadet turned the\nvalve that would open the outer air lock to the jet-boat deck.\n\nFive minutes later, the ship was swarming with tight-lipped enlisted\nSolar Guardsmen, who spoke to Strong and the cadets with cool courtesy.\nThese were men who signed up for two years as guards on the Rock after\ncompeting with thousands of other enlisted men. A guard on the Rock was\npaid triple wages for the two-year isolation. But more than anything else\nthe right to wear the bright white patch with a paralo-ray gun in the\ncenter denoting their service as guards on the Rock was prestige envied\neven by commissioned officers of the Solar Guard.\n\nAfter what Tom thought to be the most thorough search he had ever seen\nwas over, Lieutenant Williams reported to the control deck where Strong\nand the cadets had been politely but firmly detained. He informed them\nthat they were now ready to blast off to the Rock, adding that a more\ndetailed search of the area between the ship's outer and inner hulls\nwould be conducted after they had gone.\n\n\"You mean,\" said Tom, amazed, \"that you actually search the four inches\nbetween the two hulls? What in the universe could we possibly hide in\nthere?\"\n\n\"I don't know, Corbett,\" replied Williams. \"We've never found anything\nthere.\" He turned to Strong and smiled. \"But there's always a first\ntime, isn't there, sir?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course,\" agreed Strong. \"You do a thorough job, Williams. Very\ngood indeed!\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said Williams. \"You know, we've heard about you and\nthe _Polaris_ unit here on the Rock.\" He turned to Tom, Roger, and\nAstro. \"We have a stereo of that mercuryball game you played at the\nAcademy when you were Earthworms.\"\n\n\"What?\" cried Tom. \"You mean that game was recorded?\"\n\n\"It sure was,\" said Williams. \"But we've seen it at least fifty times.\"\n\n\"Well, blast my jets!\" said Astro in amazement.\n\nThe game was one that the cadets had played when they first entered the\nAcademy. It had done much to unify the boys into a fighting team.\n\nAn enlisted sergeant suddenly appeared, snapping to attention in front\nof Lieutenant Williams. \"Ready to blast off, sir,\" he said.\n\n\"Very well,\" said Williams, then turned to Strong and the cadets.\n\"Follow me, please.\"\n\nIn a few moments the space launch was blasting away from the freighter\nand heading for a tiny planetoid in the distance. As they drew near,\nStrong and the cadets peered out of the ports to get a view of the\nprison, but were disappointed when Williams ordered the ports covered.\n\nHe smiled apologetically at Strong and explained, \"All approaches are\nsecret, sir. We can't allow anyone to see where our defenses are\nlocated.\"\n\n\"You fellows certainly believe in keeping prisoners in and visitors\nout!\" commented Strong.\n\n\"Anyone interested in coming to the Rock, sir,\" said Williams, \"is under\nnatural suspicion.\"\n\nThe three cadets gulped, duly impressed with the severity of the prison\nroutine.\n\nSoon they felt the unmistakable jar and bump of the small space vessel\ntouching the surface of the planetoid. The jets cut out suddenly and\nWilliams stood up.\n\n\"Please follow me. Do not speak to anyone, and do not stop walking. Keep\nyour hands in front of you and maintain a distance of ten feet between\nyou and the man in front of you.\"\n\nHe walked through the open hatch where a hard-faced enlisted guardsman\nstood rigidly, holding a paralo-ray gun at the ready.\n\nWith a quick nod to the cadets Strong followed Williams through the\nhatch. At ten-foot intervals they followed him out of the hatch, with\nTom bringing up the rear and the enlisted guardsman behind him.\n\nAs Tom stepped out onto the surface of the asteroid he wasn't quite sure\nwhat he expected to see, but he certainly wasn't ready for the sight\nthat greeted his eyes.\n\nAs far as he could see, there was grass, spotted with small one-story\nbuildings. To the left was a single towering structure built of Titan\ncrystal and on top of it was the largest atomic blaster he had ever\nseen. He turned to ask the guardsman about the gun but was motioned\nahead with a curt, \"No questions. Keep walking.\"\n\nTom continued to walk. He noticed that they were heading for the tower.\nAs he drew nearer, he could see men walking around a narrow catwalk at\nthe top. They all carried paralo-ray rifles with miniature grids mounted\non the barrel. Inside the rifle was a tiny radar direction finder. It\nwas a simple but effective control against escaping prisoners. Each of\nthe inmates of the Rock wore small metal disks welded to a thin chain\naround their waists. The disk was sensitive to radar impulses, and with\nno more effort than snapping a thumb catch on the rifle, the guard could\nlocate and paralyze the nearest disk-wearing inmate.\n\nTom was so full of questions it was necessary for the guard to warn him\nagain, only this time in sharper tones.\n\nEntering the tower, they were scrutinized and cleared by an electronic\nbeam that passed through their bodies and indicated any metal they might\ncarry. Once through this last barrier, they were escorted to a\nslidestairs, where Williams left them.\n\nThroughout the entire procedure few words had passed between the cadets.\nNow left alone on the stairs, they couldn't contain themselves and the\ncomments and questions tumbled out.\n\n\"Did'ja see that blaster on top of this place?\" Roger blurted out.\n\n\"Those radar-controlled paralo-ray rifles are really something!\" said\nAstro.\n\n\"The thing I want to know,\" said Tom, \"is where are the prisoners? I\nhaven't seen one yet.\"\n\n\"And you're not likely to, either, Cadet Corbett!\" said a gruff voice\nabove them. They turned to see a heavy-set man wearing the uniform of a\nmajor in the Solar Guard, standing on the floor above them. The\nslidestairs carried them to his level and Captain Strong hopped off and\nextended his hand in greeting.\n\n\"Major Savage!\" he explained. \"Good to see you again!\"\n\n\"Same here,\" said Savage, returning Strong's firm handclasp. He turned\nand faced the cadets. \"So this is the _Polaris_ unit, eh?\" He smiled.\n\"We've really enjoyed the stereo of that game of mercuryball you played\nback at the Academy.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said Tom. \"Lieutenant Williams has already told us how\nmuch he liked it.\"\n\n\"Come into my quarters and relax. I imagine you could do with some good\nsolid food after those synthetics on your trip.\"\n\n\"We certainly could, sir,\" said Strong.\n\nThey followed the big man through a sliding panel into a suite of\ncomfortably furnished rooms. Five minutes later, the cadets and the\nofficers were enjoying their first hot meal in a week. As they ate,\nMajor Savage brought up the purpose of their visit. \"So you've come to\ntalk to Bull Coxine, eh?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" nodded Strong. \"And I don't imagine he has developed any\naffection for me.\"\n\n\"No, I wouldn't say he has,\" replied Savage. \"In fact, I don't think\nBull has any affection for anyone, not even himself. Why do you want to\nsee him, anyway?\"\n\nStrong quickly summarized the theft of the adjustable light-key and the\nunsuccessful search for Wallace and Simms, concluding finally with the\nknowledge of Coxine's association with Wallace.\n\n\"I'm hoping Coxine will give me a lead to Wallace's whereabouts,\" said\nStrong.\n\n\"Well, you can ask him,\" shrugged the major. \"But personally, I don't\nthink you're going to get any further than saying hello. If he'll even\nlet you say that. He hates you, Strong. Hates you in a way I've never\nseen a man hate before. When you talk to him, be careful.\"\n\n\"I will,\" said Strong grimly.\n\n\"Don't let him get near you. He's the strongest man I've ever seen. Came\nblasted near choking a guard to death with one hand when he escaped. He\ncould break a man's neck with both hands.\"\n\nStrong smiled. \"Evidently, Major, you haven't noticed the size of Cadet\nAstro. I'll take him along with me for protection.\" He looked at Astro,\nwho flushed in quick embarrassment.\n\n\"Very well, Strong,\" said Savage. \"I'll have a jet car brought around.\nYou can go right down to his hut.\"\n\n\"Er--may I ask a question, sir?\" asked Tom.\n\nThe major smiled. \"Go right ahead, Corbett.\"\n\n\"It's about this whole setup,\" explained Tom. \"I was expecting fences\nand prisoners and--well, most anything but green grass and small white\nbuildings!\"\n\n\"The little huts you saw,\" replied the major, \"are as much of a prison\nas we have. Each hut holds one prisoner. He has all the necessary\nfurniture, in addition to audioceivers and story spools which he can\nchange once a week. He also has basic garden equipment. All prisoners\ngrow everything they eat. Each man is dependent on himself and is\nrestricted to the hut and the area around it. If he comes within two\nmiles of the tower, the guards will pick him up on radar and order him\nback. If he comes within one mile, they fire without further warning.\nOnly one man has ever escaped. Coxine. And that was because we had a\nsick man on guard duty, or he never would have made it. He overpowered\nthe guard, took his uniform, and stowed away on a supply ship. We caught\nhim a year later.\"\n\n\"Didn't your radar pick up the disk he was wearing, sir?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"That method of protection was only installed a few months ago,\" said\nthe major.\n\n\"And the prisoners just sit there--in those little huts?\" asked Astro.\n\n\"Yes, Astro!\" said the major with a tone of finality in his voice. \"They\njust sit. This is the end of the line.\"\n\nThe three cadets looked at each other and secretly vowed never to take a\nchance of doing anything that would send them to the Rock.\n\nFive minutes later, Strong was driving a jet car along a narrow paved\nroad toward one of the white huts. Astro sat beside him grimly silent,\nhis hands balled into tight hamlike fists. They rounded a curve and\nStrong pulled up in front of the house. As they climbed out of the car,\nthey could see the trim neat lanes of the little garden with carefully\nprinted signs on each row indicating what was growing. They started for\nthe house and then stopped short. Bull Coxine stood in the doorway,\nwatching them.\n\nDressed in the snow-white coverall of the prison garb, Coxine faced them\nsquarely, his thick trunklike legs spread wide apart. He was a giant of\na man with long heavily muscled arms that dangled from a huge pair of\nshoulders. His jet-black hair was a tangled unkempt mass, and his face\nwas scarred and lined. Eyes blazing with unconcealed hatred he waited\nfor Captain Strong to make the first move.\n\n\"Hello, Bull,\" said Strong quietly. \"I'd like to talk to you.\"\n\n\"Oh, you would, huh?\" Coxine spat and his lips twisted in a mocking\ngrin. \"What's the matter? Afraid to talk to me alone?\" he indicated\nAstro. \"Did you have to bring one of your Space Cadets for protection?\"\n\n\"Listen, Bull,\" urged Strong, \"I was your friend once. I turned you in\nbecause you were a mutineer and I was an officer of the Solar Guard. I'd\ndo the same to this cadet if he tried what you did.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I'll bet you would,\" snarled the criminal. \"Just like a real\nfriend!\" His voice deepened into a low roar. \"Don't talk to me about the\nold days! I'm on the Rock and you're just another Solar Guard space\ncrawler to me. Now get out of here and leave me alone.\"\n\n\"I came to ask you to help me, Bull,\" Strong persisted. \"I need\ninformation.\"\n\nCoxine's eyes narrowed into slits. \"What kind of information?\"\n\n\"You once tried to hold up a Credit Exchange on Ganymede with a man\ncalled Gus Wallace. He had a hide-out in the asteroid belt. I'd like to\nknow where it is,\" said Strong.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"I can't answer that, Bull.\"\n\n\"What do I get if I tell you?\"\n\n\"Nothing, except my thanks and the thanks of the Solar Guard.\"\n\n\"And if I don't?\"\n\n\"I'll turn around and leave.\"\n\n\"Then start turning, Strong,\" snarled the giant prisoner, \"because I\nain't got nothing to tell you except how much I hate your guts!\"\n\nAstro moved forward slightly, but Strong held him back. \"O.K., Bull. If\nthat's the way you want it, I'll leave.\"\n\n\"Why don't you let the young punk try something?\" challenged Coxine. \"I\nain't had any exercise in a long time.\"\n\nStrong looked at the huge man and said coldly, \"I wouldn't want the\ndeath of a piece of space scum to show on his record.\"\n\nThen, as if the space and sky overhead had suddenly been torn open,\nthere was a flash of light followed by the roar of a tremendous\nexplosion. The ground trembled. The air seemed to moan in agony. Strong\nand Astro wheeled around and looked toward the tower that shimmered in\nthe light of the late afternoon sun. To their horror, they saw the\nunmistakable mushrooming cloud of an atomic blast rising in the\nsynthetic atmosphere behind it.\n\n\"By the craters of Luna--\" gasped Strong.\n\nA second flash and explosion rocked the prison asteroid and suddenly the\ntower disappeared. Almost immediately, a spaceship appeared over the\nsmall planetoid and began systematically pounding the surface\ninstallations with atomic blasters.\n\n\"Captain Strong,\" cried Astro. \"Tom and Roger--they were in the tower!\"\n\n\"Come on,\" yelled Strong, \"we've got to get back!\"\n\n\"You ain't going nowhere, Strong,\" snarled Coxine behind him. \"I've been\nwaiting a long time for this!\" He suddenly struck the Solar Guard\nofficer with a heavy rock and Strong slumped to the ground unconscious.\nBefore Astro could move, Coxine smashed him to the ground with a blow on\nthe back of the neck. They both lay deathly still.\n\nThen, as the atomic bombardment of the penal asteroid continued, the\ngiant space criminal jumped into the jet car and sped away.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 11\n\n\n\"Fire!\" bawled Major Savage to his crew of gunners.\n\nAt the other end of the field one of the remaining two undamaged rocket\ndestroyers blasted off to battle the invading spaceship.\n\nTom and Roger had been on a tour of the great central tower with Major\nSavage when the attack came and had been ordered to find safety in the\nopen fields. The major knew the tower would be one of the first targets.\n\nSprawled on the ground behind a bunker, they saw the major, his space\njacket torn from his back, standing in the middle of the field, quietly\nissuing orders to scarlet-clad spacemen, desperately trying to organize\nthe penal asteroid's defenses.\n\nThe spaceship, which had somehow managed to penetrate the tight radar\nwarning screen around the prison, had struck with merciless precision.\nAgain and again, its atomic blasters had found the most important\ninstallations and had wiped them out. The first target, after the tower\nhad been shattered, was the underground launching ramps for the\nasteroid's small fleet of rocket destroyers. But even after a direct\nhit, the guards were able to ready two ships to fight the attacking\nspaceship. The first was already diving in, her small one-inch blasters\nfiring repeatedly.\n\nSuddenly, Lieutenant Williams, in command of the second ship, came\nracing up to Major Savage, to report that his radarman had been hit and\nthe ship couldn't blast off.\n\n\"Here's where I get into the act!\" Roger jumped up immediately, and with\na brief \"So long, spaceman\" to Tom, raced off to join Lieutenant\nWilliams.\n\n\"Spaceman's luck,\" yelled Tom as the officer and the cadet ran toward\nthe waiting ship.\n\nLooking skyward again, Tom saw the first destroyer diving toward the\nattacking spaceship, trying to get in range with her lighter armament.\nSuddenly there was a burst of brilliant light. The lighter ship had been\ncompletely destroyed by a direct hit.\n\nSick with horror, Tom looked away and watched the ship Roger had joined\nblast off under full acceleration. It roared spaceward in a straight\nline, disappearing at incredible speed.\n\nMeanwhile, the invader continued to blast relentlessly.\nOne--two--three--four--automatic reload--one--two--three--four, reload.\nOver and over, firing at seemingly peaceful fields of grass, only to\nstrike an armory, space cradle, or supply depot buried underneath the\nground. Suddenly it changed its course and trained its guns skyward. Tom\nlooked up and saw a tiny flyspeck roaring straight down at the ship. It\nwas Lieutenant Williams' rocket destroyer, with Roger on the radar\nbridge, in a suicidal attempt to destroy the invader. But the larger\nship was ready. The two forward blasters opened fire. A flaming ball of\nlight exploded near the stabilizer of the destroyer and it fell off\ncourse to float helplessly in free-fall orbit around the asteroid. Still\nlying on the ground, Tom sighed with relief. At least Roger was all\nright.\n\nThen the young cadet saw the invading spaceship move away from the area\naround the tower toward the horizon not too far away on the small\nplanetoid. He followed it with his eyes and saw it suddenly land near a\ncluster of white prisoner huts. Tom gasped as the reason for the attack\nbecame clear.\n\n\"Major! Major! Major Savage!\" he called as he raced across the field.\nBut the major was nowhere to be seen. A guard carrying a medical kit\nhurried past him and Tom grabbed him by the arm.\n\n\"Major Savage! Where is he?\"\n\nThe guard pointed to a near-by stretcher and Tom saw the unconscious\nfigure of the major sprawled on the plastic frame.\n\n\"But--but the prisoners are getting away!\" yelled Tom.\n\n\"I can't do anything about it. I've got wounded men to care for!\" The\nman jerked away and disappeared in the smoky, choking dust.\n\nThe curly-haired space cadet, his face blackened from the smoke, his\nlungs crying for fresh air, started across the blast-pitted field,\nlooking for help. But there was none to be had. Suddenly he wheeled in\nthe direction of the spaceship and started to run toward it.\n\nAs soon as the young cadet had left the smoking area around the wrecked\ntower, he realized that it was the only section of the small satellite\nthat had suffered attack. Ahead, he could see the prisoners in their\nwhite suits crowding around the stabilizer air lock of the invading\nship.\n\nTom dropped to his stomach and watched the knot of men. Suddenly the\nair-lock portal slid open. There was a loud cheer and the prisoners\nbegan scrambling aboard.\n\nTom knew he would have to move fast. Taking a dangerous chance, he rose\nto a half-crouch and dashed to one of the small white huts only a\nhundred feet away. With a final glance at the thinning crowd of escaping\nmen around the ship, he ran straight for an open window, diving headlong\nthrough it.\n\nInside, Tom waited breathlessly for a shout or warning that he had been\nseen, but none came. He glanced through the window and saw that only\nseven or eight men remained outside the port. He turned away quickly and\nbegan searching the hut.\n\nHe found what he was looking for rolled up on the bed where its owner\nhad used it as an extra pillow. He shook out the prison suit of white\ncoveralls, stripped off his own blue cadet's uniform, and hurriedly put\non the distinctive prison gear. It was a little large for him and he\nrolled up the sleeves and trouser legs, hoping no one would notice in\nthe excitement. Then, with a deep breath, he stepped out of the hut into\nfull view of the prisoners still left at the air lock.\n\n\"Hey, wait for me!\" he yelled, running for the ship.\n\nThe men paid no attention in their haste to get aboard the ship. When\nTom reached the air lock, there were only two left. He slapped the\nnearest man on the back.\n\n\"Pal, I've been waiting for this a long time!\"\n\n\"Yah,\" the man answered, \"me too!\" Then he looked at Tom closely. \"Say,\nI've never seen you around here before!\"\n\n\"I just got in on the supply ship last week. They kept me in the tower\nfor a while,\" Tom replied.\n\n\"Oh, well,\" said the man, \"they ain't keepin' anybody there anymore!\"\n\n\"Come on you guys,\" snarled a heavy-set man in the air lock above them.\n\"We ain't got all day!\"\n\nTom looked up, and without being told, he felt he was looking into the\nface of Bull Coxine. And when the other prisoner spoke, he was certain.\n\n\"Yeah, Bull,\" said the man. \"Comin', comin'!\" He reached up and Bull\ngrabbed his outstretched hand. When Bull pulled, the man literally\nleaped through the air into the air lock.\n\n\"All right, space crawler,\" roared Bull to Tom, \"you're next!\" The big\nman stuck out his hand. Tom gulped. For one desperate second he thought\nof turning and running away.\n\n\"Well?\" growled Bull. \"You coming or ain't cha?\"\n\n\"You're blasted right I'm coming,\" said Tom. \"This is one time the Solar\nGuard is taking it on the chin. And, crawler, am I happy to see it!\"\n\nHe grabbed Bull's hand and was lifted as easily as if he had been a\nfeather. Coxine dropped him on the deck and turned away without a word\nto disappear inside the ship.\n\nAs he looked around, Tom suddenly felt a cold shiver run through his\nbody. He felt as if he had signed his own death warrant. There was no\nmistake about it. The ship was the same one he had watched night after\nnight at the exposition on Venus. And the names of the two owners\nexploded in his brain. \"Wallace and Simms!\"\n\nHe turned to jump out of the air lock, but it slid closed in front of\nhim. He was trapped.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSprawled on the ground in front of one of the white houses near the\ntower perimeter, Captain Strong stirred, shook his head, and painfully\nrose to a half-crouch. With eyes still dulled by shock, he looked around\nto see Astro lying unconscious a few feet away. His brain still reeling\nfrom the effects of Coxine's sneak attack, he staggered over to his\nknees beside him.\n\n\"Astro, Astro--\" Strong called. \"Astro, snap out of it!\"\n\nThe big Venusian moaned and opened his eyes. He sat bolt upright.\n\"Captain Strong! What happened?\"\n\n\"I'm not too sure, Astro,\" said Strong. \"All I remember is Coxine\nslugging me.\"\n\nAs they struggled to their feet, they suddenly noticed the towering\ncolumns of smoke rising into the air.\n\n\"By the rings of Saturn!\" gasped Strong. \"Look, Astro!\"\n\n\"Blast my jets!\" cried the big cadet. \"What--what could have happened?\"\n\nThe two spacemen stood gaping at the shattered remains of the tower and\nthe smoldering area around it. In the distance, scarlet-clad guardsmen\nmoved dazedly around the wreckage and above them a rocket destroyer was\nblasting on one jet, coming in for a touchdown.\n\n\"Astro,\" said Strong grimly, \"I don't know how it could have happened,\nbut the prison asteroid has been attacked. A rocket-blasting good job of\nit! Come on! We've got to get over there!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Astro. As they started running toward the field, he\nsearched the figures moving about in the distance for two familiar blue\nuniforms. \"I don't see Roger or Tom, sir,\" he said hesitantly. \"Do you\nthink--?\"\n\n\"We'll just have to wait and see,\" interrupted Strong grimly. \"Come on,\nstep it up!\"\n\nAs the two spacemen approached the smoking ruins of the underground\ncradles, ammunition dumps, and repair shops, they passed groups of men\ndigging into the rubble. In sharp contrast to the careful scrutiny they\nhad received when they first arrived at the prison, no one noticed them\nnow. Strong stepped up to a man in a torn and dirty sergeant's uniform.\n\n\"What happened?\" he asked.\n\nThe man turned and looked at Strong and Astro. Aside from the swollen\nbump on the Solar Guard captain's head and the bruise on the cadet's\nneck there were no signs of their having been in the attack. When the\nguardsman finally replied, there was a sharp edge to his voice. \"I\nthought _everyone_ knew we were attacked, _sir_!\" He turned back to a\ndetail of men who were watching. But Strong pulled the man up sharply.\n\n\"Attention!\" he barked. The sergeant and the crew came to stiff\nattention. Strong stepped forward and looked the guardsman straight in\nthe eye. \"Under any other circumstances, Sergeant,\" snapped Strong, \"I'd\nhave your stripes and throw you in the brig for your insolence! Now I\nwant a clear account of what happened. And I want it blasted _quick_!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\" stammered the guardsman, realizing he had gone too far. He\nhurriedly gave a detailed description of the battle, ending with a\nreport that Major Savage had been injured and that Lieutenant Williams\nwas now in command of the prison.\n\n\"Where will I find Lieutenant Williams?\" asked Strong.\n\n\"At the rocket destroyer, sir. It just landed.\"\n\n\"Very well, Sergeant!\" said Strong, adding in a gentler tone, \"I realize\nyou've had a rough time of it, so we'll forget what just happened. Get\nback to your work.\"\n\nAs Astro followed the Solar Guard captain toward the rocket ship he saw\na familiar figure standing near the air lock. A boy with close-cropped\nblond hair and wearing cadet blues.\n\n\"Roger!\" yelled Astro joyfully. \"Captain Strong, look! It's Roger!\"\n\nThey quickened their pace and were soon beside the small space vessel\nthat had been blasted out of commission before it could fire a shot.\nWhile Roger was telling them of having volunteered for radar operations\naboard the ship and of their being disabled by a near miss, Lieutenant\nWilliams suddenly appeared in the air lock and saluted smartly.\n\n\"Major Savage has been injured, sir,\" said Williams. \"Since you are the\nhighest ranking officer on the asteroid, are there any orders?\"\n\n\"I'm not acquainted with your men, or your prison, Williams,\" replied\nStrong. \"I'll accept the command as a formality but appoint you my chief\naid. Carry on and do anything necessary to get things cleared away.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir,\" said Williams.\n\n\"Have communications been destroyed?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Communications was located in the tower, but Cadet Manning\nhas converted the equipment on ship for long-range audio transmission.\"\n\n\"Very good!\" said Strong. \"As soon as you get a chance, I want you to\nmake out a full report on the attack, including your personal opinion of\nwho attacked us and why.\"\n\n\"I don't know who manned that ship, sir,\" said Williams, \"but I can tell\nthe reason all right. Every prisoner on the asteroid has escaped!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" mused Strong. \"I thought that would be the answer. But how did\nthat ship get through your defenses?\"\n\n\"Captain Strong,\" said Williams grimly, \"I don't think there is any\nquestion about it. Someone broke the asteroid code. The attacking ship\nidentified itself as the regular supply ship.\"\n\n\"A Solar Guardsman?\" asked Strong.\n\n\"No, sir,\" said Williams. \"I'd bet anything that none of our men would\ndo that!\"\n\n\"Then who?\" asked Strong.\n\n\"Only one man would be smart enough to get the code and break it, and\nthen sneak it off to the attacking ship!\n\n\"Who?\" asked Strong.\n\n\"Bull Coxine!\" answered the young officer through clenched teeth.\n\nThey were interrupted by a guardsman. \"Sir, we found this in prison hut\ntwenty-four.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Strong.\n\nAstro's eyes suddenly widened and he stepped forward. \"Why,\nthat's ... that's Tom's uniform!\" he stammered.\n\n\"Tom!\" gasped Strong. \"But where is he?\"\n\n\"We've searched the immediate area, sir,\" replied the guardsman. \"Cadet\nCorbett isn't here.\"\n\n\"Are you sure?\" demanded Strong.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said the guardsman stoutly.\n\nStrong took the uniform and examined it carefully. Then he turned to\nRoger and snapped, \"Prepare the audioceiver for immediate transmission\nto Space Academy, Manning. Astro! Get aboard our ship. Check her for\ndamage and let me know how soon we can blast off!\"\n\nThe two cadets saluted and raced for the small spaceship.\n\nThoughtfully holding Tom's uniform in his hand, Strong turned back to\nWilliams. \"I'm going to leave as soon as I can, Williams. I'll tell\nSpace Academy about the attack and see that a relief ship is sent out to\nyou right away. Meantime, I'm leaving you in command.\" He paused and\nlooked at Tom's uniform again. \"If Cadet Corbett isn't on the asteroid,\nhe must be on the attacking ship with the prisoners. The only question\nnow is, do they know it?\"\n\n\"You mean he smuggled himself aboard?\" asked Williams.\n\n\"I'm almost sure of it!\" said Strong. \"And if he _is_, he's going to try\nto get some sort of message out. I've got to be ready to pick it up.\"\n\nStrong paused and looked up at the sky overhead, still thick with smoke.\n\"And if he does ask for help, I'm going to answer him with the biggest\nfleet of spaceships he'll ever see in his life!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 12\n\n\n\"Stand by, you space crawlers!\" roared Bull Coxine into the microphone,\nbut the loud laughter and singing of the noisily celebrating prisoners\ncontinued unabated over the intercom's loud-speakers. \"Avast there!\" he\nbellowed again. \"Stow that noise! Attention! And I want _attention_!\"\n\nStanding on the control deck of his ship, Coxine waited as the men\ngradually quieted down. No longer wearing the white prison coverall, he\nwas dressed in a black merchant spaceman's uniform, the snug-fitting\njacket and trousers stretching tightly across his huge shoulders. He\nwore a black spaceman's cap, and two paralo-ray pistol belts were\ncrisscrossed over his hips.\n\n\"Now listen to me!\" he roared again. \"Let's get one thing straight! I'm\nthe skipper of this ship and the first man that thinks he's smarter than\nme, let him speak up!\"\n\nThere was a long pause and the big man added with an ominous whisper,\n\"But I warn you, if one of you opens your mouth, you'll take a swim in\nspace!\"\n\nThere was an angry murmur among the prisoners that Coxine heard over the\nintercom. \"Don't think I can't take care of you, the lot of you, one by\none or all at once. I cut my milk teeth on mutiny. I know how to start\none and I know how to finish one! I needed a crew and that's the only\nreason you're here! Any spaceman that doesn't like the way I run things\naboard this ship, better keep it to himself, or start swimming back to\nthe prison asteroid!\" He paused. \"Well? Are you all with me?\"\n\nThere was a chorus of cheers on the intercom and Coxine nodded grimly.\n\n\"All right,\" he continued, \"now that we understand each other, I'll get\non with the business. Second-in-command to me will be Gus Wallace.\n_Lieutenant_ Wallace!\"\n\nA roar of approval came over the loud-speaker.\n\n\"Third-in-command--Luther Simms! _Lieutenant_ Simms!\"\n\nThere was another roar of approval as the prisoners recognized the names\nof the men who had liberated them from the asteroid.\n\n\"Now, we'll handle this ship as if it were any other freighter. The\nfollowing men will be in charge of departments!\"\n\nAs Coxine read off the list of jobs and the men to handle them, there\nwere yells of approval and disapproval for favorites and old enemies.\nWhen the list of names had been read, he turned away from the intercom\nand faced his lieutenants, Wallace and Simms.\n\n\"Well, skipper,\" boasted Wallace, \"it looks like we're in business\nagain!\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" chimed in Simms. \"In three hours we'll be on our own asteroid\nand we can start planning our first strike!\"\n\nCoxine's eyes narrowed into slits. \"Get this, both of you!\" he snapped.\n\"What I said to those crawlers down below goes for you too. I'm the boss\nof this outfit and you don't even guess about what we're going to do,\nuntil I say so!\"\n\n\"But, Bull--!\" whined Wallace.\n\n\"Shut up!\" roared Coxine. \"And when you talk to me, you call me\ncaptain!\"\n\nWallace and Simms looked at each other. \"O.K., Captain,\" muttered Simms.\n\n\"Yes, _sir_!\" corrected Coxine.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Simms quickly.\n\n\"That's better,\" growled the giant spaceman. \"Don't get the idea that\njust because you were able to follow orders that it makes you smart.\nBecause it doesn't! It took me two and a half years to get the\ninformation collected onto these story spools and smuggle them out to\nyou. Everything, from where to buy this spaceship to getting the\nlight-key out of the time capsule, was my idea! My brains!\"\n\n\"Sure, Captain,\" said Wallace, \"but we took the chances!\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" sneered Coxine. \"You took chances! The only chance you took was\nin not paying attention to what I told you to do. I gave it all to you.\nWhere to hold up the first freighter passenger, what to take, how to\nmount the atomic blasters, what code to use in getting through the\nprison defenses. The whole works! And I did it while sitting on the\ntoughest Rock in the system. I smuggled it out right under the noses of\nthose Solar Guard space crawlers. So forget about being smart, or you'll\nwind up with that scum below decks!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\" said Wallace.\n\n\"Now get me a course to the asteroid and make it quick. And have some\ndecent grub sent up to my quarters right away!\"\n\nThe big man turned lightly on the balls of his feet and disappeared\nthrough the hatch. After a moment, Wallace turned to Simms.\n\n\"That big space-crawling bum!\" snorted Wallace. \"I oughta blast him!\"\n\n\"Go ahead!\" sneered Simms. \"You were the one who wanted to get him off\nthe Rock, not me!\"\n\n\"Aw shut up!\" snarled Wallace. He turned to the intercom and began\nbarking orders to his new crew.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTom Corbett sat in one corner of a cargo compartment that had been\nconverted into sleeping quarters, watching the celebrating prisoners.\nSomeone had broken into the galley stores and mixed a concoction of\nfruit, alcohol, and reactor priming fluid to make a foul-tasting rocket\njuice. The men sat about in various stages of undress as they changed\nfrom the white prison coveralls to the black uniforms of the merchant\nspaceman, and drank heavily from a huge pot of the liquid.\n\nOne of the men, short and stumpy, but with shoulders like an ape, was\nstanding on a table boasting about his strength. He was stripped to the\nwaist and Tom could see the powerful arms and chest beneath the black\nhair that covered his body. As he continued to brag, the prisoners\nlaughed and jeered, calling him Monkey. The man's face reddened and he\noffered to fight anyone in the room. A short, thin man with a hawk nose\nsitting next to Tom yelled, \"Monkey,\" and then darted behind a bunk. The\nman turned and looked angrily at Tom.\n\n\"You there!\" the man on the table called, looking at Tom. \"You call me\nMonkey?\"\n\nTom shook his head. Since the blast-off he had stayed away from the men\nas much as he could, certain that sooner or later someone would\nchallenge him and discover he wasn't a prisoner. He hoped to remain\naboard the ship long enough to plant a signal for the Solar Guard to\nfollow. Tom felt almost certain they would be heading for Wallace and\nSimms' hide-out. And so far, the men had been so excited over their new\nfreedom they hadn't bothered him. He had managed to sit quietly in the\ncorner of the storage compartment and watch them.\n\n\"I'm talking to _you_!\" shouted the hairy man, looking straight at Tom.\n\"You called me Monkey and then lied about it! Maybe you're scared, eh?\"\n\nHe slipped off the table and advanced toward Tom. The young cadet tried\nto figure a way out of the threatening fight. He wasn't afraid of the\nman, but he didn't want to draw attention to himself. And one of the\nsurest ways of letting Wallace and Simms know he was aboard ship was to\nget into a fight. He couldn't risk discovery. He had to signal the Solar\nGuard before he was caught. But how to get around the hairy, drunken\ncriminal now standing over him?\n\nTom looked up and saw that the man would not be put off. He would have\nto fight. He took notice of the powerful arms and shoulders, and decided\nhis best bet would be to stay away, but glancing around quickly he saw\nthere wasn't any room to retreat. The other prisoners were crowding\naround, eager to watch the fight. Suddenly his opponent let out an\nanimal-like roar and jumped to pin him down on the deck.\n\nThe young cadet timed his move perfectly. As the man's body came down on\nhim, he threw up both legs and caught him in the pit of his stomach. Tom\ncould feel his feet sink deep into the man's mid-section as he kicked\nout hard and sent him sprawling against the bulkhead. With a bellow of\nrage, the hairy man picked himself up and charged back at Tom, who was\nnow on his feet, braced to meet him.\n\n[Illustration: _The young cadet timed his move perfectly_]\n\nAs the prisoners began to roar, Tom side-stepped and back-pedaled\nfrantically, trying to get out of the impossible situation. If he won,\nthere would be questions for him to answer. Questions that would be\ndifficult and might betray his identity. But if he allowed Monkey to\nwin, he might die right there on the deck. The man was blind with rage\nand would stop at nothing.\n\nThe man rushed in again and, unable to back away, Tom felt the hairy\narms close around him in the most powerful grip he had ever felt in his\nlife. Slowly, evenly, Monkey applied pressure. Tom thought his ribs\nwould crack. His head began to swim. The faces around him that laughed\nand jeered suddenly began to spin around him dizzily.\n\nThen, with the desperation of a man facing death, Tom began to push\noutward, his arms under Monkey's chin. The man tried to apply more\npressure but the cadet fought him, forcing his head back farther and\nfarther. The prisoners were silent, watching the deadly battle. Then,\ngradually, Tom felt the hairy man's grip relaxing. With the last ounce\nof his strength he burst out of the encircling arms and staggered back.\nThe ape man looked at him stupidly and then down at his arms as if they\nhad betrayed him. With a roar, he came rushing in again. Tom set\nhimself, left foot forward, shoulders hunched, and when Monkey came\nwithin arm's length, he swung with all the strength he had left in his\nbody. His fist landed on the point of Monkey's chin. There was a\ndistinct sound of crushing bone and Monkey sank to the deck, out cold.\nGasping for breath, Tom stood over the sprawled man and just looked at\nhim. The crowd around him was staring at the fallen man in disbelief.\nThrough the roaring in his head, Tom could hear their voices, \"He broke\nout of Monkey's grip!\" \"He broke the guy's jaw with one punch!\"\n\nTom turned blindly to the corner where he had been sitting and slumped\nto the deck. Someone shoved a cup in his hands and he gulped its\ncontents blindly, hardly tasting the foul rocket juice or feeling it\nburning his throat.\n\nThe cadet was sure now that he would be caught. Monkey had been a\npopular member of the crew and some of his friends were certain to even\nthe score. But to Tom's surprise, there were no questions and a few of\nthe men came over to pat him drunkenly on the back. A couple of them\ndragged the unconscious man out of the compartment and up to sick bay.\nThe others soon forgot the fight and continued their merrymaking.\n\nTom sat alone and silent in the corner, his strength returning slowly.\nHe had faced his first obstacle and had won. But he knew that what lay\nahead of him made the fight insignificant by comparison. He decided his\nnext move would be to acquaint himself with the ship and, if possible,\nget a paralo-ray gun.\n\nAs the men continued their drunken singing and yelling he mumbled an\nexcuse about soaking his fist in cold water and managed to escape from\nthe crowded compartment.\n\nOutside in the passageway, the cadet began to figure out the plan of the\nship, first locating the power deck by its roaring purr. He climbed a\nladder to the next deck, walked slowly down the passageway toward what\nhe thought to be the control room, and leaned against the hatch. He\nheard the soft tinkle of a radar signal and his heart skipped a beat. He\nhad stumbled onto the astrogation and radar bridge. Wondering if he\nshould burst into the room and attempt to overpower the men on duty, or\nwait for a better chance later, he was suddenly startled by a sharp\nvoice in back of him.\n\n\"You--spaceman!\" Tom turned to stare right into the face of Bull Coxine!\n\nThe big man looked at Tom with piercing eyes.\n\n\"What's your name?\" demanded Coxine.\n\n\"Uh--uh--they call me the Space Kid!\" he finally managed.\n\n\"Space Kid, eh?\" mused Coxine. \"I don't remember seeing you on the\nRock.\"\n\n\"They held me in the tower for a month trying to make me take the\npsychograph rehabilitation. I got out when the blasting started.\"\n\n\"What were you on the Rock for?\" asked Coxine. \"You're pretty young to\nbe sent to the Rock.\"\n\nTom thought desperately of a crime he could have committed that would\nsend him to the prison asteroid. Suddenly he got an idea. He looked at\nCoxine and spoke in as harsh a voice as he could.\n\n\"Listen,\" he snarled, \"I just broke Monkey's jaw for treating me like a\nkid. I hope you don't crowd me into fighting you by asking so many\nquestions. Y'see I won't answer them and then you'll have to freeze me.\"\nTom paused and tried to gauge Coxine's reaction. But he couldn't see a\nthing in the cold staring eyes. \"And,\" Tom continued, \"if you freeze me,\nyou'll lose a better man than most of the scum in your crew!\"\n\nCoxine stepped forward and towered over the curly-haired cadet. When he\nspoke, his deep voice echoed in the deserted passageway.\n\n\"What was your rating as spaceman before you hit the Rock?\" asked the\nbig man.\n\nTom's heart raced. If he could get to the control deck or the radar\nbridge, he could send his signal easily. But he realized quickly that in\neither of these places he would be spotted almost immediately by Wallace\nor Simms. He had to stay away from them and wait for a later chance.\nTom's mind raced.\n\n\"I was a gunner on a deep spacer,\" he drawled confidently. \"I can take\nthe space tan off a crawler's nose at a hundred thousand yards with\nanything from a two-inch to a six-inch blaster.\"\n\nCoxine's eyes sharpened. \"Where did you learn to use a six-incher?\nThey're only on heavy cruisers of the Solar Guard!\"\n\nTom could have bitten his tongue off. He had slipped. He thought\nquickly. \"I was an enlisted spaceman in the Solar Guard.\"\n\n\"Why'd you get sent to the Rock?\"\n\n\"My officer was a smart-alec lieutenant just out of Space Academy. We\ngot in a fight--\" Tom didn't finish the sentence.\n\n\"And you were kicked out, eh?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" said Tom. \"I hit him so hard--he never woke up again. I had\nto blast out of there, but they caught me.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Coxine. \"Report to the gunnery chief. Tell him I said\nyou're second-in-command.\" The big man turned and walked away from the\ncadet without another word.\n\nTom watched him disappear and smiled. He had faced two impossible\nsituations, the fight with Monkey and now this meeting, and he had come\nout on top in each. Perhaps he had a chance, after all.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 13\n\n\n\"Any report from the search squadrons yet, Steve?\" asked Commander\nWalters.\n\n\"No, sir,\" replied Captain Strong. \"We're concentrating on the asteroid\nbelt, but so far we've drawn a blank.\"\n\n\"Well, keep trying and let me know the minute something turns up,\" said\nWalters.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Strong, saluting his commanding officer as the elder\nspaceman left the room. He turned back to a large desk in the center of\nthe room where Roger Manning was busy noting figures on a large chart,\nshowing the areas already covered and listing the squadrons engaged in\nthe search.\n\nAs Strong leaned over his shoulder, Roger placed a finger on the chart.\n\"Squadron Ten has just completed a search of all asteroids in their\nassigned area,\" he said, then added laconically, \"Nothing.\"\n\nStrong studied the chart a moment. \"Well, we'll have to keep it up,\" he\nsaid. \"It's the only way we'll find them. A systematic search of the\nbelt from end one to the other.\" He paused and then muttered, \"Only one\nthing I'm worried about.\"\n\n\"What's that, sir?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"That when we do find them, it'll be too late to help Tom.\"\n\n\"You really think he's aboard Coxine's ship, Captain Strong?\"\n\n\"Couldn't be anywhere else,\" answered Strong. \"And he'll be trying to\nsignal us, you can bet on that. Keep me posted on all radar contacts\nmade by the search squadrons. I want a continuous six-way radar sweep by\nevery ship.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Roger.\n\n\"One more thing,\" said Strong, \"tell Astro to get the _Polaris_ ready to\nblast off. And you make sure your radar bridge is in A-one condition.\"\n\n\"Are we blasting off, sir?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"Every ship we can get into space will give us a better chance of\nfinding Coxine and his crew. Now that we've got the search fully under\nway there's no need to hang around here any longer.\"\n\n\"Glad to hear it, sir,\" replied Roger. \"I was getting a little itchy to\nhunt for those crawlers myself. And Astro can hardly keep still.\"\n\nStrong smiled. \"Don't worry, we'll find Tom,\" he said. \"Wherever he is,\nyou can bet he's taking care of himself and doing a good job for the\nSolar Guard.\"\n\nRoger's eyes twinkled. \"Oh, I wasn't so worried about Tom as I was\nAstro, sir. He'll be pretty mad if there isn't anything left of Coxine\nto pay him back for slugging him.\"\n\nStrong rubbed his head and said grimly, \"Astro's not the only one!\"\n\nThe blond-haired cadet left the room, and Strong wearily turned back to\nstudy the chart of the search in the asteroid belt.\n\nImmediately upon arrival at Space Academy, two days before, Strong had\nbeen placed in charge of the search by Commander Walters. The attack on\nthe prison asteroid and the escape of the prisoners had created the\nbiggest sensation in his life. From one end of the Solar Alliance to the\nother, the visunews and the stereos were full of the attack and escape\ndetails, with Strong's name appearing often in the headlines and news\nflashes. To search the asteroid belt had been his suggestion, and while\nhe could offer no proof, he believed the attacking ship had been\ncommanded by Wallace and Simms. Speaking only to Commander Walters,\nStrong had received permission to combine the search for Wallace and\nSimms, with the new hunt for Coxine. Strong was convinced that Coxine\nwas behind the activity of Wallace and Simms, from the beginning at the\nSolar Exposition to the present.\n\nStrong looked at his watch. It was past midnight. He flipped a switch\nand paged Lieutenant Moore on the central communicators. In a few\nmoments the young officer appeared and saluted smartly.\n\n\"Take over here, Moore,\" said Strong. \"I'm going to sack in for a little\nrest and then take the _Polaris_ out. I'll be in constant contact with\nyou and will direct search operations from the _Polaris_. You stand by\nhere and relay all reports. We'll use code 'VISTA' for all contacts.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Moore. \"Shall I work up charts like that one?\" He\npointed to the chart left by Roger.\n\n\"Statistics here at the academy will handle that,\" replied Strong. \"Just\nshoot the information down to them as you receive it. And you'd better\nget someone else up here to help you. You'll be here a long time.\"\n\nMoore saluted and Strong walked wearily from the room. There wasn't any\nneed for cleverness now, thought the Solar Guard captain. When we catch\nCoxine, he'll fight. And when he fights, that will be the end of him!\n\nHe went to his quarters and in thirty seconds was asleep.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Radar bridge to control deck!\" A voice crackled over the intercom\naboard the newly named pirate ship, _Avenger_. \"Hullo, control deck!\nCome in!\"\n\n\"Yeah?\" roared Bull Coxine. \"Whaddya want?\"\n\n\"Picked up a blip on the radar, Captain,\" replied the radar officer.\n\"Looks to me like the jet liner from Mars to Venus.\"\n\n\"Relay the pickup to the control-deck scanner and let me take a look at\nit,\" ordered Coxine.\n\nIn a moment the big pirate was studying the scanner carefully. Wallace\nand Simms stood to one side. Coxine turned and looked at them with a\nhard glint in his eyes. \"That's the jet liner, all right!\" He rubbed the\npalms of his huge hands together and smiled thinly. \"It looks like we're\nin business!\"\n\nWallace stepped forward. \"You mean, you're going to--?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what I mean,\" snapped Coxine, \"when I want you to know\nit!\"\n\nHe turned to the intercom and began to bawl orders into the microphone.\n\n\"All hands! Stand by your stations for attack!\"\n\nThere was an answering roar of approval from the crew.\n\n\"We're making our first strike, you space crawlers! A jet liner from\nMars to Venus. There'll be lots of fancy things aboard her. Things the\nSolar Guard wouldn't give you on the Rock!\"\n\nThere was another roar over the loud-speaker.\n\n\"But the first man that takes anything but what I tell him will find\nhimself on the wrong end of two big fists!\"\n\n\"We're closing in, Captain,\" interrupted the voice from the radar\nbridge. \"The angle of approach is in our favor. I don't think they've\nseen us yet!\"\n\n\"Keep watching her, Joe,\" replied Coxine, and turned to his two henchmen\non the control deck. \"You, Wallace! Take number-one jet boat. Russell,\nStephens, Attardi, and Harris. Each man will take a paralo-ray pistol\nand rifle. Report to your boat when I give the order.\"\n\nThere was a pause as the men named scurried to their stations. Coxine\ncontinued, \"The following men will come with me in boat number two.\nShelly, Martin, and the Space Kid. The rest of you man the forward and\naft blasters. But no one fires until Lieutenant Simms gives the order!\"\n\nHe turned to Simms and stared at the man coldly. \"I'll be in contact\nwith you all the time. You'll fire when I say to fire, and not before.\nIs that clear?\"\n\nSimms nodded.\n\n\"Range-fifty thousand yards to liner, Captain!\" reported the radar\nbridge. \"I think she's sighted us!\"\n\n\"Forward turret!\" roared Coxine. \"Put a blast across her bow just to\nshow how friendly we are!\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" acknowledged a voice from the gun turret.\n\nIn the turret Tom listened to the orders to attack the helpless\nspaceship with mounting anxiety. If he could only plant the signal on\nthe _Avenger_ before going to the liner, he might be able to remain\naboard the passenger ship and escape. He was interrupted in his thoughts\nby a rough voice in back of him.\n\n\"Hey, Kid! Space Kid!\" yelled Gaillard, the commander of the gun turret.\n\"Come on! You heard the orders, didn't you? Get me the range.\"\n\n\"Right away,\" answered Tom. He stepped to the range finder, quickly\nfigured the speed of the jet liner, their own speed and the angle of\napproach. Racking them up on the electronic tracker, he turned back to\nGaillard, \"Let her go!\"\n\n\"Fire!\"\n\nThere was a thunderous noise and the _Avenger_ rocked gently in recoil\nfrom the heavy blast. Tom quickly sighted on the range finder and saw a\nball of light flash brilliantly in front of the passenger ship. He\nbreathed a sigh of relief. He had to keep up his avowed reputation of\nbeing a crack marksman and at the same time could not damage the unarmed\npassenger ship. The shot had been perfect.\n\n\"Good shooting, Kid,\" roared Coxine from the control deck.\n\n\"Thanks, skipper,\" said Tom, aware that he had not called Coxine\ncaptain, but knowing that his earlier speech to the giant pirate had\nearned him a certain amount of respect.\n\nCoxine quickly made contact with the captain of the liner on the\nteleceiver and the outraged captain's face sharpened into focus on the\nscreen aboard the _Avenger_.\n\n\"By the craters of Luna,\" exploded the skipper of the passenger ship,\n\"what's the meaning of this? There are women and children aboard this\nvessel.\"\n\nCoxine smiled thinly. \"My name's Bull Coxine, master of the vessel\n_Avenger_. One funny move out of you and I'll blast your ship into\nprotons! Stand by for a boarding party!\"\n\n\"Captain! Captain!\" the radar operator's voice screamed over the\ncontrol-deck loud-speaker, \"they're trying to send out a signal to the\nSolar Guard!\"\n\n\"They are, huh?\" roared Coxine. \"Forward turret, check in!\"\n\n\"Turret, aye!\" reported Tom. He had been left alone while Gaillard\nissued small arms to the boarding parties.\n\n\"Listen, Kid!\" roared Coxine. \"You said you're a good shot. Right now is\nthe time to prove it. Blast away her audio antenna!\"\n\nTom gulped. At a range of fifty thousand yards, the antenna, a thick\npiece of steel cable, might as well have been a needle to hit.\n\n\"Right, skipper,\" he finally replied. \"I'll show you some of the\nfanciest shooting you'll ever see in your life!\"\n\nHe turned back to the range finder, his mind racing like a calculating\nmachine. He figured the angles of the two ships, considering that the\njet liner was a dead ship in space and the _Avenger_ still under way,\nbut slowing down at a specific rate of deceleration. He rechecked his\nfigure a third and fourth time, correcting his calculations each time\nwith the forward movement of the _Avenger_. If he misjudged a fraction\nof a degree, he might kill or injure hundreds of people aboard the\npassenger vessel.\n\n\"Well?\" roared Coxine. \"Are you going to fire or not?\"\n\n\"Coming right up, skipper!\" shouted Tom. \"Watch this!\"\n\nSteeling himself, lest he should hit the ill-fated ship, he fired. For a\nbrief moment he felt sick and then heard the roar of the pirate captain\nfrom the control deck.\n\n\"By the rings of Saturn,\" roared Coxine, \"that was the best shot I've\never seen! Well done, Kid! All right, boarding crews! Man your boats and\nstand by to blast off!\"\n\nWhile Coxine vocally lashed the members of the murderous crew into\naction, Tom tried to figure out some way to get to the radar deck\nunseen. Being assigned to the jet boat with Coxine, instead of Wallace,\nhad been a lucky break and Tom wished for a little more of the same.\nLining up with his boarding crew, he received his paralo-ray pistol and\nrifle from Gaillard, deftly stealing a second pistol while the gunnery\nofficer's back was turned.\n\nAfter hurriedly hiding the stolen gun, he slipped stealthily topside to\nthe radar bridge. Reaching the hatch, he was about to open it, when he\nheard footsteps. He turned and saw a man walking toward him. It was\nSimms!\n\n\"Where in the blasted universe is the jet-boat deck?\" snarled Tom. He\ndropped his rifle on the deck and bent over to pick it up, hiding his\nface.\n\n\"You're on the wrong deck,\" said Simms. \"Two decks below. Get moving!\"\n\nThe pirate lieutenant hardly gave the cadet a glance as he brushed past\nand entered the radar bridge. Tom caught a fleeting glimpse of the\ninterior. His heart jumped. The bridge was exactly like the one on the\n_Polaris_! Though annoyed that his chance had slipped past, Tom was\nthankful to learn that the communications equipment was thoroughly\nfamiliar.\n\n\"Space Kid! Report to the jet-boat deck on the double!\" Coxine's voice\nrumbled through the empty passageway. Tom dashed down the nearest ladder\nand hurried to the jet-boat deck where the pirate captain waited\nimpatiently.\n\n\"I was checking the range and setting up to blast the liner in case they\ntry anything funny,\" explained Tom. \"I don't trust anyone on that range\nfinder but me!\"\n\nCoxine chuckled. \"Good work, Kid. I like a man that thinks ahead. Maybe\nI made the wrong man gunnery chief.\" He climbed into the jet boat. \"All\nright, take the controls, Kid. Shelly and Martin, get in the stern.\" The\nmen climbed in and Tom slid under the controls and waited for the order\nto blast off.\n\nWallace and his crew were on the opposite side of the ship, so Tom had\nno fear of being recognized until they were all on the passenger ship.\nAt his side, Coxine spoke to Wallace in the other jet boat over the\naudioceiver.\n\n\"We'll split up. I'll handle the control deck and you go aft to the\nsupply lockers. Dump everything out in space and we can pick it up\nlater. Search the passengers, but no rough stuff. The first man that\nputs his hands on anyone will never know what hit him!\"\n\nTom listened to the pirate captain's orders and was forced to give the\nman credit for his tight control over his murderous crew. However\nrebellious he might be against the Solar Guard, and whatever it was that\nmade the man become the system's most notorious criminal, his orders\nspoke for themselves.\n\n\"All right, Kid,\" roared Coxine, \"blast off!\"\n\nTom pressed the control pedal at his foot and the small ship shot out\ninto the black void of space. Ahead of them, thousands of yards away, he\ncould see the gleaming passenger ship.\n\nIn a few moments the two jet boats were braking their jets and drifting\nto a stop inside the catapult deck of the luxurious liner.\n\nAlmost before Tom had stopped the small craft, Coxine was out of the\nboat waving his paralo-ray pistols at a cluster of frightened merchant\nspacemen.\n\n\"Back inside!\" he snarled. \"Kid! Shelly! Cover me! We're going to the\ncontrol deck. Martin, you stay here with the jet boat.\"\n\nCoxine marched straight through the ship, head up, eyes straight ahead,\nwhile behind him, Tom and Shelly swept the luxurious lounges with their\nray rifles, ready to fire on any who dared resist. They marched past the\nfrightened passengers, climbed a flight of carpeted stairs to the next\ndeck, and entered the control room.\n\nThe liner's captain, a tall, thin man with graying hair, stood waiting\nbeside the control panel, his eyes flashing angrily. A half-dozen junior\nofficers stood stiffly in back of him.\n\nCoxine stepped up to the elderly officer and laughed good-naturedly. \"No\none will be hurt, skipper. I just want a few things for my men\"--he\npaused and glanced at the ship's vault--\"and whatever you have in\nthere!\"\n\n\"I'll live to see the day when you're caught and sent to the prison\nasteroid for this,\" snorted the captain.\n\n\"Don't make me laugh, skipper,\" said Coxine lightly. \"The Solar Guard\nwill have to build a new one for me. Don't think there's much left of\nthe old one!\"\n\n\"Then it was you! You're responsible for the attack on the asteroid!\"\n\nCoxine just smiled and turned to Tom and Shelly. \"Watch these crawlers\nclosely, now. I'm going to open the vault.\"\n\nTom stared at the ship's officers, hoping to catch the eye of one of\nthem, but they were all watching Coxine.\n\nThe pirate captain pulled a thin rod about two feet long, with a switch\non one end, from his jacket. He walked to the solid titanium door of the\nvault and inserted the rod into a small hole, pressing the switch at the\nend of the rod carefully several times. He stepped back and inserted it\nin another hole in the face of the door and repeated the procedure.\nPutting the key back in his jacket he grabbed the handle of the massive\ndoor. It swung open at his touch. The captain of the liner and officers\ngasped in amazement.\n\nWorking quickly, Coxine crammed the thick bundles of credit notes and\npassenger's valuables into a bag. At last he straightened up, and facing\nthe unbelieving officer again, he tossed them a mocking salute. He\nnodded to Tom and Shelly and walked out of the control room without\nanother word.\n\nShelly and Tom quickly followed the giant spaceman back to the jet-boat\ndeck, where Wallace was just returning from his own operations. Wallace\nmade a circle out of his fingers to Coxine and the giant pirate nodded.\n\n\"Let's get out of here!\" he ordered.\n\n\"Aren't you afraid they'll try to stop you, skipper?\" asked Tom.\n\nCoxine laughed. \"Just let them try. I never met a man yet that had the\nnerve to pull the trigger of a paralo-ray gun while my back was turned.\"\n\nTom gulped and wondered if he would have the nerve to fire on the\nspaceman. He thought about it a moment and decided that he would take\nany chance that came along, if he could outwit the criminal. When the\ntime came, he would risk his life to stop Coxine!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 14\n\n\n\"All right, line up, you space crawlers!\" bawled Coxine. \"When I call\nyour name step up to get your share of the haul!\"\n\nThe pirate captain was seated at the head of a long mess table, an open\nledger in front of him. There were stacks of crisp new credit notes at\nhis elbow. He took out his paralo-ray pistols and placed them within\neasy reach. On either side of him, Wallace and Simms sat, staring at the\nmoney with greedy eyes.\n\nCoxine looked at the first name on the ledger.\n\n\"Joe Brooks!\" he called. \"One thousand credits for spotting the liner!\"\n\nBrooks grinned and amid cheers walked to the table. Coxine handed him a\nsmall stack of notes carelessly and turned back to the ledger.\n\n\"Gil Attardi!\" he roared. \"One thousand credits for working on the\nboarding crew.\"\n\nAttardi, a sly, scar-faced man, stepped forward to accept his share. He\ncarried a long, thin knife with an edge so deadly keen that he could and\noften did shave with it.\n\nCoxine continued his roll call. \"Sam Bates! Five hundred credits.\nStraight share.\"\n\nBates stepped forward and glared at Coxine.\n\n\"How come I only get five hundred and the others get a thousand?\" he\nsnarled. \"It ain't my fault I'm stuck on the power deck while you grab\nall the glory jobs!\"\n\nThe laughing, excited crowd of men grew silent as the rebellious\nspaceman faced Coxine.\n\n\"You get five hundred credits,\" snarled Coxine. \"Take it or leave it!\"\n\n\"I want the same as Brooks and Attardi,\" demanded Bates.\n\nQuicker than the eye could follow, Coxine rose and smashed the man in\nthe face with a giant fist. Bates dropped to the deck like a stone.\nCoxine glared at the rest of the crew.\n\n\"The next crawler that thinks he's not getting his fair share,\" he\nsnarled, \"will get a trip in space for his share!\" He glanced down at\nthe unconscious man and jerked his thumb toward the hatch. \"Get him out\nof here!\"\n\nTwo men dragged the unconscious man away and threw a bucket of cold\nwater on him. He woke up, snatched at his share of the credits, and\ndisappeared from the room.\n\nThe pirate captain continued reading the list of names, arbitrarily,\nhanding out various amounts of the stolen money as he saw fit.\n\nStanding in the rear of the messroom, hidden by the other members of the\ncrew, Tom realized that to step in plain sight of Wallace and Simms for\nhis share would mean instant betrayal. He had to make his move now, and\nwith most of the crew mustered together in the messroom, it was his one\nchance for success.\n\nGripping the stolen paralo-ray gun in his jacket pocket, he slipped out\nof the messroom unnoticed and headed for the radar bridge.\n\nAs he raced up the companionway he could hear the laughter of the men\nbelow decks as one by one they received their shares. His name would be\ncalled soon. Heart pounding, he stopped outside the radar hatch, pulled\nthe paralo-ray gun from his jacket, and taking a deep breath opened the\nhatch.\n\nJoe Brooks was seated in front of the scanner counting his share\ngreedily and glancing occasionally at the finger of light that swept\nacross the green globe. When Tom opened the hatch, he looked up and\nsmiled.\n\n\"Hiya, Kid,\" he said. \"Coxine's all right. I got a thousand just for\npicking up that ship on the radar. How much did you collect?\"\n\n\"This,\" said Tom. He shoved the paralo-ray gun into Brooks' stomach. The\nman gulped and finally found his voice.\n\n\"Say, what is this? A gag? Where did you get that paralo-ray?\" Then\nsuddenly he shoved the bundle of notes in his pocket. \"Oh, no, you\ndon't! You're not going to steal my share!\"\n\n\"I don't want your money!\" said Tom coldly. \"Get into that locker and\nkeep your mouth shut, or I'll blast you!\"\n\n\"Locker? Say, what's the matter with you? You gone space happy?\"\n\n\"Get in there,\" growled Tom. At the look on the cadet's face, Brooks\nrose quickly and stepped into the locker. Tom slammed the door and\nlocked it. Then, locking the passageway hatch, he turned to the radar\nscanner. Working quickly with deft hands, he opened the casing around\nthe delicate instrument and began disconnecting the major terminals.\nStudying the complicated tangle of connections, he wished that he had as\nmuch knowledge of radar as Roger.\n\nHe finally found the wires he wanted and separated them from the other\nconnections. He began replacing them, altering the terminals. After\nchecking his work, to make sure it would not short-circuit, he grabbed\nthe intercom and began taking it apart. Sweat beaded his forehead. Time\nwas short. Soon Coxine would miss him and come looking for him. He had\nto complete his job before that happened.\n\nAfter moments that seemed like hours he was ready. Using one of the\nintercom relays he began tapping out a message in Morse code on an\nexposed wire from the scanner. He looked at the radar scanner and\nwatched it flash white static lines each time he touched the wires.\nCarefully he tapped out a message.\n\n\" ... emergency ... attention ... Corbett ... Space Cadet ... aboard ...\nCoxine ... pirate ... ship ... space quadrant ... B ... section ...\ntwenty ... three ...\"\n\nOver and over he repeated the desperate message, hoping against hope\nthat someone would be scanning space and the interference would show up\non their radar.\n\n\" ... emergency ... attention ... Corbett ... Space Cadet--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Captain Strong!\" Roger's voice came shrieking over the ship's intercom.\n\"Captain! Quick! I'm picking up a message from Tom!\"\n\n\"What?\" cried the Solar Guard officer. \"Nail it! I'm coming up!\"\n\nScrambling up the ladder to the radar bridge from the control deck,\nCaptain Strong rushed over to the scanner and watched eagerly as\nblinking flashes washed out the background of the screen.\n\nSlowly, at times unevenly, the message flashed and the two spacemen read\nit with gladdening hearts. Strong made a careful note of the position\nwhile Roger continued to read the flashes. Turning to the astrogation\npanel, the Solar Guard captain quickly plotted a course that would bring\nthem to Tom's position.\n\nEndlessly, during the past few days, Strong, Roger, and Astro had swept\nspace in a wide arc around the asteroid belt, hoping to pick up just\nsuch a signal. Now, with the position of the _Avenger_ in his hands,\nStrong grabbed for the intercom.\n\n\"Attention, power deck!\" yelled Strong. \"We've just picked up a message\nfrom Tom. He's given us his position, so stand by for a course change.\"\n\n\"Yeee-eooow!\" roared Astro. \"I knew he'd do it.\"\n\n\"He's not in the clear yet. We've only got his position. We don't know\nhow we're going to get him away from Coxine yet.\"\n\n\"Ready to change course, sir,\" said Astro.\n\n\"Three degrees on the down-plane of the ecliptic, and fifty-four degrees\nto starboard. Full space speed, Astro! Pile it on!\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir!\" replied Astro. \"I'll make this wagon's tail so hot\nit'll blast at double speed!\"\n\n\"You'd better, you Venusian ape!\" cried Roger. \"It's the least you can\ndo for Tom!\"\n\n\"Stow it, Manning,\" growled Astro good-naturedly, \"or I'll stick some of\nyour hot air in the jets for extra power!\"\n\n\"Cut the chatter, both of you!\" snapped Strong. \"Astro, execute course\nchange!\"\n\nAstro's reply was a blast on the steering rockets. On the control deck,\nStrong watched the needle of the astral compass swing around and stop\ndead on the course he had ordered.\n\n\"All set, Astro!\" shouted Strong. \"Right on course. Now pile on the\nneutrons!\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir.\"\n\nOn the power deck, the big cadet turned to his control panel, took a\ndeep breath, and opened the reactant feeders wide. The ship leaped\nthrough the airless void under the sudden burst of power and Astro\nwatched the acceleration indicator climb to the danger line. He gulped\nas the needle passed the danger point and was about to cut down speed\nwhen the needle stopped. Astro breathed easily and settled back\nsatisfied. If it was up to him, they would reach Tom in record time.\n\nUp on the radar deck, Roger continued to read the flashing signals on\nthe radar scanner. Over and over, he read the same message.\n\n\"I guess that's all he can say, sir,\" said Roger, turning to Strong.\n\n\"Yes, I guess so, Roger,\" agreed Strong. \"He's probably sending it out\nblind, on an open circuit, hoping that anyone near enough would pick it\nup. Wonder how he did it?\"\n\nRoger thought a moment. \"I'm not sure, sir, but I think he's crossed the\nimpulse on the scanner from positive to negative.\"\n\n\"How do you mean?\" asked Strong. The young captain was well acquainted\nwith the principle of radar but, admittedly, could not match Roger's\nnatural ability.\n\n\"By making the impulse negative, sir,\" said Roger, \"he could create\ninterference on the scanner. Instead of bouncing against something and\nreturning an image to a scanner, the impulse hits itself and creates\nstatic which shows up in the form of those white flashes.\"\n\n\"Well, in any case,\" said Strong with a sober nod toward the scanner,\n\"he's done something the whole Solar Guard couldn't do. He's quite a\nboy!\"\n\nRoger smiled. \"I'll say he is, skipper!\"\n\nStrong turned away and climbed down to the control deck. He sat in front\nof the great control panel and watched the countless dials and needles.\nBut his mind wasn't on the delicate handling of the great ship. He was\nthinking about Tom, alone aboard a ship with a crew of desperate\ncriminals.\n\nTom had taken his life in his hands to send out the message, that much\nStrong was sure of! And the young skipper noted with pride that there\nwas no appeal for help in the desperate call.\n\nHe shook his head wearily and flipped the teleceiver switch to report to\nCommander Walters.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Emergency ... attention....\" Tom continued to tap out the message\nslowly and carefully. Behind him, he could hear Brooks hammering against\nthe locker door. Tom felt like opening the door and freezing the pirate\nwith his paralo-ray gun to keep him quiet, but he didn't dare to stop\nsending.\n\nFinally Tom decided it was time to go. \"If anyone's going to pick up the\nmessage,\" he thought, \"they've picked it up by now. I may still have\ntime to get away in a jet boat.\"\n\nHe tied the wires together, causing a continuous interference to be sent\nout, and secured the radar casing. \"If I'm lucky enough to get away in a\njet boat,\" thought Tom, \"at least they won't be able to pick me up on\nthat!\"\n\nWithout a glance at the locker where Brooks continued to pound and yell,\nTom turned to the hatch leading to the passageway. He gripped the\nparalo-ray gun and opened the hatch. Peering into the passageway and\nfinding it deserted, he slipped out and closed the hatch behind him.\nFrom below, he could hear the roar of the crew as the last of them\nreceived his share of the stolen credits.\n\nTom raced down the companionway toward the jet-boat deck. He made the\nfirst deck safely and was about to climb down to the next when he was\nspotted by Attardi, the scar-faced spaceman, who stood at the bottom of\nthe ladder.\n\n\"Hey, Kid!\" Attardi shouted. \"The skipper's been looking for ya. You got\nthe biggest cut. Three thousand credits for that fancy shooting you\ndid!\"\n\nTom noticed the gleam of the knife at the man's side. The young cadet\ncould imagine the criminal sinking the knife in his back without\nhesitation, if he suspected anything.\n\n\"Well,\" demanded Attardi, \"are you going to collect or not? The skipper\nsent me to look for you.\"\n\nTom smiled, and while still smiling, whipped the paralo-ray gun into\nsight and fired. His aim was true. Attardi froze, every nerve in his\nbody paralyzed. He could still breathe and his heart continued to beat,\nbut otherwise, he was a living statue, unable to even blink his eyes.\n\nTom jumped past the spaceman and dashed for the jet-boat deck. He had to\nhurry now. Attardi would be discovered any moment and be neutralized.\nWhen neutralized, the victim returned to normal, with only violent\nmuscle soreness remaining.\n\nTom reached the jet-boat deck, opened the hatch, and raced for the\nnearest small craft. Suddenly from behind he could hear the buzz of a\nparalo-ray on neutralizing charge. Attardi had been discovered.\n\nTom jumped into the nearest jet boat, closed the hatch, and pressed the\nbutton releasing the sliding side of the ship's hull. Slowly, the great\nwall of metal slid back exposing the cold black velvet of deep space. As\nsoon as the opening was wide enough, Tom pressed the acceleration lever\nand the small ship shot out, its jets roaring.\n\nTom quickly glanced around to locate his position by the stars and saw\nthat he was close to the asteroid belt. He opened up to full\nacceleration, and since there was nothing else to do but wait for time\nto pass and hope for escape, he began to examine the contents of the\nsmall ship. He opened the emergency food locker and was relieved to see\nit fully stocked with synthetics and water. Every second carried him\nfarther away from the _Avenger_, and when he looked back, Tom saw no\nevidence of pursuit. The cadet smiled. They would depend on the radar to\nfind him, instead of sending out the other jet boats. Tom almost laughed\nout loud. With the radar jammed, he was safe. He would make it. Once\ninside the asteroids, they would never find him.\n\nGlancing around the few indicators on the control board of the small\nvessel, Tom's smile changed to a grimace of sudden terror. The jet boat\nhad not been refueled after their raid on the jet liner. There was less\nthan three days' oxygen remaining in the tanks. In three days the jet\nboat would become an airless shell. A vacuum no different than the cold\nsilent void of space!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 15\n\n\n\"What's our position, Roger?\" Captain Strong called into the intercom.\n\n\"Space quadrant B, section twenty-three, sir,\" replied Roger from the\nradar bridge. \"But I can't see a thing on the radar. That static flash\nTom sent out is scrambling everything.\"\n\n\"But you're sure this is our position?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. I checked it three times.\"\n\n\"All right, then,\" said Strong grimly. \"There's only one thing to do.\nWe're too near the asteroid belt to use the _Polaris_ without radar, so\nwe'll search in jet boats. Astro! We're parking right here! Give me full\nbraking rockets and secure the power deck. Then prepare the jet boats\nfor flight.\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" came the reply from the Venusian.\n\nThe ship bucked under the tremendous power of the braking rockets and\ncame to a dead stop in space. Strong dashed up the ladder to the radar\nbridge where Roger was still hunched before the radar scanner.\n\n\"Any chance of switching the scanner to another frequency and offsetting\nthe effects of the static, Roger?\" asked the Solar Guard captain.\n\nRoger shook his head. \"I don't think so, sir. The interference would\nhave to be eliminated at its source.\"\n\n\"Well,\" sighed Strong, \"to go looking for Tom without the help of radar\nwould be like looking for an air bubble in the ammonia clouds of\nJupiter. And we don't even know if he's still aboard the _Avenger_ or\nnot!\"\n\n\"You know, sir,\" said Roger speculatively, \"I've been thinking. I might\nbe able to get a fix on this interference.\"\n\n\"A fix? How?\"\n\n\"By blanking out the radar range, so that it would only work at one\npoint of the compass at one time, then testing each heading separately\nuntil the flash appears. When it does, we'd at least know in which\ndirection to blast off and trail Coxine.\n\n\"If you can do that, Roger,\" exclaimed Strong, \"it would take us right\ninto Coxine's lap! Do you think you can work it?\"\n\n\"I can try, sir.\"\n\n\"All right, then,\" decided Strong. \"Astro and I will take the jet boats\nand go looking around. Meantime, you stay aboard and try to pin point\nthe heading on that flash.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir,\" replied Roger, and turned to the radar to begin the\ncomplicated task of rewiring the instrument.\n\nStrong went directly to the jet-boat deck where Astro was busily\npreparing the jet boats for flight. He looked up when Strong entered the\nhatch.\n\n\"All ready, sir,\" he said.\n\n\"Very well,\" said Strong. \"I'll take number one, you take number two.\nWe're in section twenty-three of quadrant B. You take section twenty-two\nand I'll take twenty-four.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Astro. \"Do you think there's any chance of finding\nTom?\"\n\n\"I don't even know if he's out here, Astro. But we can't be sure he\nisn't. So we'll search and hope for the best.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir.\"\n\n\"Keep your jet-boat audioceiver open all the time and maintain contact\nwith me.\"\n\n\"Why not contact Roger here on the _Polaris_, sir?\" asked Astro.\n\n\"He's busy trying to find out where the flashing static on the radar is\ncoming from,\" explained Strong. \"We'll make wide circles, starting\noutside and working in. Blast in a continuous circle inward, like a\nspiral. If there's anything around here, we'll find it that way.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Astro. \"I sure hope Tom is O.K.\"\n\n\"Best answer I can give you. Astro, is to blast off and find out.\"\n\nThe two spacemen climbed into the small craft, and while Strong opened\nthe outer lock, exposing them to the emptiness of space, Astro started\nthe jets in his boat. With a wave of his hand to Strong, he roared away\nfrom the sleek rocket cruiser. Strong followed right on his tail. They\ncircled the _Polaris_ twice, establishing their positions, and then\nroared away from each other to begin their search.\n\nAstro turned his midget space vessel toward the asteroid belt, ahead and\nbelow him. Choosing a large asteroid that he estimated to be on the\nouter edge of section twenty-two, he roared full power toward it. The\ntiny space bodies that made up the dangerous path around the sun,\nbetween Mars and Jupiter, loomed ahead ominously. Moving toward them\nunder full rocket thrust, the Venusian cadet remembered fleetingly\nstories of survivors of space wrecks, reaching the airless little\nplanetoids, only to die when help failed to arrive. He shuddered at the\nthought of Tom, a helpless castaway on one of the asteroids, waiting to\nbe saved. Astro clenched his teeth and concentrated on the search,\ndetermined to investigate every stone large enough to support an\nEarthman.\n\nMiles away, no longer visible to Astro and out of sight of the giant\nrocket cruiser, Captain Strong felt the same helplessness as he\napproached the asteroid belt from a different angle. He realized any\nnumber of things could have happened on the pirate-ship. Tom could have\nbeen captured, or if not yet discovered, unable to escape from the ship.\nStrong's throat choked up with fierce pride over the gallant effort Tom\nhad made to warn the Solar Guard of the _Avenger's_ position.\n\nAs he neared the outer edges of the belt, he concentrated on guiding his\nsmall ship in and around the drifting asteroids, his eyes constantly\nsweeping the area around him for some sign of a drifting space-suited\nfigure. What Strong really hoped for was the sight of a jet boat, since\nin a jet boat, Tom would have a better chance of survival.\n\nThe young captain reached the outer edge of his search perimeter, turned\nthe small ship into a long-sweeping curve, and flipped on the\naudioceiver.\n\n\"Attention! Attention! Jet boat one to jet boat two! Come in, Astro!\"\n\nAcross the wide abyss of space that separated the two men, Astro heard\nhis skipper's voice crackle in his headphones.\n\n\"Astro here, sir,\" he replied.\n\n\"I'm beginning my sweep, Astro. Any luck?\"\n\n\"Not a thing, sir.\"\n\n\"All right. Let's go, and keep a sharp eye out.\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" replied Astro. He could not keep the worry out of his\nvoice, and Strong, many miles away, nodded in silent agreement with\nAstro's feelings.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe _Avenger_ had long since disappeared and Tom was left alone in space\nin the tiny jet boat. To conserve his oxygen supply, the curly-haired\ncadet had set the controls of his boat on a steady orbit around one of\nthe larger asteroids and lay down quietly on the deck. One of the first\nlessons he had learned at Space Academy was, during an emergency in\nspace when oxygen was low, to lie down and breath as slowly as possible.\nAnd, if possible, to go to sleep. Sleep, under such conditions, served\ntwo purposes. While relaxed in sleep, the body used less oxygen and\nshould help fail to arrive, the victim would slip into a suffocating\nunconsciousness, not knowing if and when death took the place of life.\n\nTom lay on the deck of the small vessel and stared at the distant stars\nthrough the clear crystal roof of his jet boat. He breathed as lightly\nas he could, taking short, slight breaths, holding them as long as he\ncould and then exhaling only when his lungs felt as if they would burst.\nHe could see Regulus overhead, and Sirius, the two great stars shining\nbrilliantly in the absolute blackness of space. He raised himself slowly\non one elbow and looked at the oxygen indicator. He saw that the needle\nhad dropped past the empty mark. He knew it wouldn't be long now. And he\nknew what he had to do. He took a last long look at the two giant stars,\nand then closed his eyes.\n\nTom no longer tried to control his breathing, but took deep satisfying\nlungfuls of oxygen and in a few moments slipped into a sound sleep.\n\nThe jet boat roared on, carrying its sleeping occupant in an endless\nspiral around the nameless asteroid.\n\nNot too many miles away, alone on the radar bridge of the giant rocket\ncruiser, Roger Manning, sweat popping out on his forehead, was trying\nthe radar scanner on the three-hundred-and-tenth point on the compass.\nHe connected the wires, glanced at the scanner, and shook his head\ndisgustedly. The scanner screen was still dark. Having adjusted the\ndelicate mechanism to eliminate the white flashes of static, he couldn't\nfind them again. He sat back in his chair for a moment, mopping his brow\nand watching the white hairline in its continuous swing around the face\nof the scope. As the line swept to the top of the screen, he saw the\nblip outline of a jet boat and recognized it as one belonging to the\n_Polaris_. Then, slowly, the line swept down and Roger suddenly saw the\nblip outline of a second craft. With the experienced eye of a radar\nveteran, Roger was able not only to distinguish the jet boats from the\nasteroids, but from each other. He gripped the edge of the instrument\nand shouted at the top of his voice. The second boat was a different\nmodel!\n\nHe reached for the audioceiver and switched it on.\n\n\"Attention! Attention! Captain Strong! Astro! Come in! This is Manning\naboard the _Polaris_! Come in!\"\n\nStrong and Astro replied almost together.\n\n\"Strong here!\"\n\n\"Astro here!\"\n\n\"I've spotted a jet boat!\" Roger shouted. \"You think it might be--\"\n\n\"Where?\" bawled Astro before Roger could finish. \"Where is it, you\nrockethead?\"\n\n\"As close as I can figure it, he's circling an asteroid, a big one, at\nthe intersection of sections twenty-one and twenty-two!\"\n\n\"Twenty-one and twenty-two! Got it!\" yelled Astro.\n\n\"I'll meet you there, Astro!\" said Strong.\n\nAstro and Strong turned their small ships in the direction of the\nintersecting space sections. Astro was the first to spot the asteroid,\nbut for a moment he couldn't see the jet boat on the opposite side of\nthe small celestial body. Meanwhile, Strong, coming from the other\ndirection, saw the boat and relayed the position to Astro. In a few\nmoments the two space craft had regulated their speeds to that of Tom's\nship and were hastily donning space suits. A quick look inside had shown\nthem Tom's sleeping body. As Astro started to open the crystal hatch of\nhis ship to cross over to the other, Strong yelled over the audioceiver.\n\n\"Astro, wait!\"\n\nAstro looked across at the captain's ship questioningly.\n\n\"Tom isn't in a space suit. If we open the hatch it would kill him.\nWe've got to tow him back to the _Polaris_ and get his boat inside the\nair lock before we can open the hatch!\"\n\nWithout a word, Astro nodded, ducked inside his ship, and climbed out\nagain with a length of rope. Working quickly, he tied one end securely\nto the bow of Tom's jet boat and made the other end fast to the stern of\nhis. Then returning to his cockpit, he sent the jet boat hurtling back\ntoward the _Polaris_.\n\nBut he was still faced with the problem of getting Tom's jet boat inside\nthe air lock. It was still under acceleration and there was no way to\nget inside to stop its jet motors. Astro called to Strong and explained\nthe situation to him.\n\n\"Looks like the only thing we can do, sir, is keep going until it runs\nout of fuel.\"\n\n\"That might take too long, Astro,\" replied Strong. \"No telling how much\noxygen Tom has left.\"\n\n\"There's nothing else we can do, sir,\" replied Astro. \"We can't brake\nher to land inside the _Polaris_ and we can't open the hatch to turn off\nthe motor. We'll have to take a chance on Tom lasting until it runs out\nof fuel!\"\n\nInside the roaring craft, Tom suddenly opened his eyes. He began to\ncough. There was a roaring in his ears. The stars overhead swam dizzily.\nAnd then, as though through a billowing mist, he saw the jet boat ahead\nof him and the rope tied to his ship. He realized he had been rescued.\nHe tried to signal them. He had to let them know he needed oxygen. He\ntried to reach the communicator near the control panel but could not\nlift his arm. He fell back to the deck gasping for air; his lungs\nscreaming for oxygen. Something, thought Tom through the haze that\nfogged his brain, something to signal them. Then, with the last of his\nstrength, he raised up on one elbow and reached for the acceleration\nlever. His fingers trembled a few inches away from their goal. His face\nbegan to turn violent red. He strained a little more. The lever was an\ninch away. Finally, with the very last ounce of his strength, he touched\nthe lever and pulled it back by the weight of his falling body.\n\nEven before the black cloud swept over him, Tom could hear the jets\nbecome silent. He had signaled them. He had stopped the jet boat. They\nwould know, now, how to save him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 16\n\n\n\"... and you never picked up that static flash again, eh?\" mused Strong,\nlooking at Roger. \"Well, the only reason I can think of is that someone\naboard the _Avenger_ must have discovered what was happening.\"\n\n\"That's the way I figure it, sir,\" replied Roger.\n\nThe Solar Guard captain studied the scanner that was now working in\nperfect order. \"It's a tough break that we couldn't get that fix on\nCoxine's position. I was counting on it. But at least we found Tom.\nThat's plenty to be thankful for.\"\n\n\"How is he, sir?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"He'll be all right,\" replied the Solar Guard captain, his face showing\nthe strain of the past weeks. \"We gave him pure oxygen and he came to\nlong enough to tell us what happened aboard the _Avenger_. Get me\nteleceiver contact with Space Academy as soon as possible. I've got to\nsend a report to Commander Walters.\"\n\n\"Right, sir.\"\n\n\"You've done a good job, Manning. Your work here on the radar bridge did\nas much toward saving Tom's life as anything.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir. After what Tom did on the _Avenger_, though, I don't\nfeel like I've done very much. It took real courage to go aboard that\nship with Coxine.\"\n\nStrong smiled wearily. \"Well, the boy is safe now and we have a good\nidea what part of the belt Coxine is operating in. With a little luck\nand a thorough fleet patrol, we might be able to get him before he can\ndo any more harm.\"\n\nStrong went below to the cadet's quarters where Astro was sitting\nquietly, watching Tom. The cadet was sound asleep. When Strong entered,\nAstro held a finger to his lips and met the captain at the door.\n\n\"How is he?\" whispered Strong.\n\n\"He's been sleeping since he spoke to you, sir,\" said Astro. \"He's\npretty weak, but I don't think there's anything seriously wrong with\nhim. After a good rest, he'll be as good as new.\"\n\n\"Thank the universe for that,\" breathed Strong. He glanced at the\nsleeping cadet and then turned back to Astro. \"Better take your station.\nHe'll be all right now. I want to get back to the Academy as soon as I\ncan.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Attention, Captain Strong,\" Roger's voice crackled over the intercom\nloud-speaker. \"I've made contact with Commander Walters at Space\nAcademy, sir. He's standing by for your report.\"\n\nStrong returned to the control deck where he saw the sharp image of the\nSpace Academy commander waiting on the teleceiver screen.\n\nHe told the grim-faced senior officer of discovering the static Morse\ncode flashes sent out by Tom from the Avenger and the race to save Tom's\nlife. When he finished, the commander's face seemed to relax.\n\n\"When Corbett wakes up, give him my personal congratulations, Steve.\nThat goes for Astro, Roger, and yourself, as well.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said Strong. \"Since Coxine seems to be operating\nexclusively out of the asteroid belt, I think it would be a good idea to\nconcentrate the entire fleet of patrol ships in that area.\"\n\n\"Good idea! I'll set it up. But get back here as soon as possible,\nSteve. Coxine and that crew on the _Avenger_ aren't sitting still.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, sir?\"\n\n\"In the last three days we've had reports from seven ships. Jet liners,\npassenger freighters, and supply ships. All were attacked by the\n_Avenger_ and stripped of everything those criminals could load on their\nmurderous backs. Blasters, paralo-ray guns, whole and synthetic\nfoodstuffs, clothes, money, jewels, equipment. Everything under the\nstars that they could use. Any ship that even comes close to the\nasteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, unless escorted, is a dead space\nbird. And if we did provide an escort, we wouldn't have enough ships\nleft to carry on the search.\"\n\nStrong listened to the news with rising anger.\n\n\"I'll blast back to the Academy as soon as I can, sir,\" said Strong.\n\n\"Fine!\" said the commander. \"End transmission!\"\n\n\"End transmission!\"\n\nStrong turned off the teleceiver and called Roger onto the radar bridge.\n\n\"Have you got a course back to the Academy, Roger?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"All right, give it to Astro and let's get moving. Every minute wasted\nnow is the difference between a ship looted and the future safety of the\nspace lanes. I have a feeling that Coxine is not just playing for the\nhauls he makes on those helpless jet liners.\"\n\n\"I don't get you, sir.\"\n\n\"Look at it this way, Roger,\" replied Strong with a grim smile. \"A man\nsmart enough to do what he did while he was confined to a prison\nasteroid might have bigger ideas now that he's free. Ideas about himself\nand the whole Solar Alliance!\"\n\nDuring the weeks following, the activity of Bull Coxine and his pirate\ncrew justified Captain Strong's fears. Repeatedly, ships were attacked\non the fringe of the asteroid belt and stripped of armor, food supplies,\nand valuables. With the secret of the light-key, the vaults of the ships\nwere opened as easily as though there had been no lock at all. The\ntotals had reached staggering amounts and the daring of the _Avenger_\nwas more pronounced, as Coxine struck repeatedly, farther and farther\naway from the protection of the asteroid belt. It seemed as though he\nwere taunting the Solar Guard with his exploits.\n\nAll defense measures seemed to be futile. When the space freighters and\njet liners were armed and tried to resist attack, Coxine blasted them\ninto helpless space junk at a frightful cost of life. When the ships\nwere escorted by powerful rocket cruisers, the pirate refused to attack,\nbut the search squadrons were correspondingly depleted. The combinations\nof the energy locks were changed every day, but with the adjustable\nlight-key, Coxine met every change easily. The entire Solar Alliance was\nin an uproar, and the citizens of the planets were clamoring for action.\n\n[Illustration: _All Solar Guard defense measures seemed to be futile_]\n\nFinally, the commanding officers of the Solar Guard noticed a change in\nCoxine's operations. Instead of merely attacking spaceships and\nhijacking their cargoes, he now took over the vessel completely, sending\nthe passengers and crews drifting helplessly in space in jet boats.\nThree large, fast space freighters of the same class as the _Avenger_\nwere now in the pirates' hands.\n\nThen, one morning, in his headquarters at Space Academy, Captain Strong\nreceived an electrifying report. Coxine had attacked a freighter\nescorted by a Solar Guard rocket scout. Outgunned, the scout had been\ndestroyed, but it had inflicted damage on the _Avenger_. The last report\nfrom a dying communications officer on the scout was that the pirate\nship was drifting helplessly in space!\n\nStrong, his face showing hope for the first time in weeks, burned the\nteleceivers, flashing orders to the various elements of the search fleet\nto converge on the disabled _Avenger_.\n\n\"Attention! All ships in quadrants C through M and Q through B-l!\nProceed full thrust to quadrant A-2, section fifty-nine. On approaching\ntarget you will signal standard surrender message, and if not obeyed,\nyou will open fire!\"\n\nBehind him, the three cadets of the _Polaris_ unit listened to the\ndecisive words of their commander and then let out an earsplitting yell.\n\n\"No time for celebrating,\" barked Strong. \"We haven't caught him yet.\nHe's the slickest thing to hit this system since the reptiles climbed\nout of the Venusian mud! It's going to be a case of our getting him\nbefore he can disappear into the asteroid belt, so let's hit the high,\nwide, and deep!\"\n\nFive minutes later, Strong and the boys were aboard their ship.\n\n\"Ready to blast off, sir,\" reported Tom. The curly-haired cadet's face\nwas still pale and drawn, showing the effects of his ordeal in space.\n\n\"Get me direct teleceiver contact with Captain Randolph on the rocket\ncruiser _Sirius_,\" ordered Strong.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Tom. He turned to flip on the teleceiver, and a\nmoment later the captain's face appeared on the screen.\n\n\"Randolph here. What's up, Steve?\"\n\n\"I've got Squadron Nineteen of the Martian reserve fleet heading for the\nlast reported position of the _Avenger_ now, Randy. I'll take the point\nposition of your squadron and direct operations. I'll relay course to\nyou as soon as we're in space.\"\n\n\"O.K., Steve,\" replied Randolph. \"I'm ready to raise ship.\"\n\n\"I'll go up first. Form up around me at about five thousand miles. End\ntransmission!\"\n\n\"End transmission!\"\n\n\"All right, Tom,\" ordered Strong, \"let's get out of here!\"\n\nThe young cadet strapped himself into his acceleration chair, then\npicked up the control panel intercom and began calling out orders\ncrisply.\n\n\"Stand by to raise ship! All stations check in!\"\n\n\"Power deck standing by!\" replied Astro from below.\n\n\"Radar bridge standing by!\" acknowledged Roger over the intercom.\n\n\"Energize the cooling pumps!\"\n\nThe whine of the mighty pumps began to fill the ship almost as quickly\nas Astro acknowledged the order.\n\n\"Feed reactant!\" snapped Strong, strapping himself in beside Tom.\n\nA low-muted hiss joined the sound of the whining pumps as Tom opened the\nvalves. \"Reactant feeding at D-9 rate, sir,\" he reported.\n\n\"Roger,\" called Strong into the intercom, \"do we have a clear\ntrajectory?\"\n\n\"Clear as space, skipper!\" was Roger's breezy answer.\n\n\"All right, Tom,\" said Strong, \"cut in take-off gyros.\"\n\nThe cadet closed the master switch on the control panel and the noise\nfrom the power deck below began to build to an unbearable crescendo!\n\nWatching the sweeping second hand of the chronometer, Tom called out,\n\"Blast off minus five--four--three--two--one--_zero_!\"\n\nWith a mighty roar, all main rockets of the spaceship exploded into\nlife. Shuddering under the sudden surge of power, the ship rose from the\nground, accelerated at the rate of seven miles per second, and arrowed\ninto the sky, space-borne!\n\nOn the Academy spaceport, ships of Squadron L began to blast off one by\none behind the _Polaris_ at ten-second intervals. Three rocket cruisers,\nsix destroyers, and twelve rocket scouts. The explosive blast of one\nhardly rolling away across the surrounding hills before another\ndeafening blast lifted the next space vessel away from Earth.\n\nAboard the _Polaris_, Roger was busy over the chart table plotting the\ncourse when Strong appeared at his side.\n\n\"Have that course for you in a minute, sir,\" said Roger. He turned to\nthe astrogation prism and made careful observations of Regulus, the\nfixed star always used in astrogation. He jotted several numbers down on\na piece of paper, rechecked them against a table of relative values and\nhanded the papers to Strong.\n\nThe captain immediately opened the teleceiver and relayed the\ninformation to other ships of the squadron. After the _Polaris_ had made\nthe course change, the ships followed, taking positions all around the\nlead vessel.\n\nLike fingers of a giant hand, the Solar Guard squadrons converged on the\nreported position of the disabled _Avenger_. From every ship, radar\nscanners probed the space ahead with invisible electronic fingers for\ncontact with the target. On the _Polaris_, Strong, his nimble brain\nfiguring Coxine's possibilities of escape, hunched over the chart table\nand worked at plotting alternate courses on which he could send pursuit\nsquadrons on a moment's notice. One thing worried Strong, and that was\nif Coxine should repair his ship and make the security of the asteroid\nbelt before they could reach him, it would be almost impossible to track\nhim through that tortuous maze of space junk.\n\nSquadron Ten was the first to sight the enemy spaceship, though it was\ntoo far away to attack. The commander reported his finding to Strong\nimmediately.\n\n\"We still have quite a way to go before we reach him, Strong. But if our\nluck holds out, we might be able to pin him down in a wide circle.\"\n\nStrong studied the chart and marked the position of the _Avenger_ just\nreported. He compared the position to that of the other fleet ships and\ndecided that they were still too far away to tighten a ring of armor\naround the pirate. Strong was well aware that if the Solar Guard could\nspot Coxine, he in turn could spot them. Luck, mused Strong to himself,\nwas what they needed now. A little luck to keep the pirate from\nrepairing his ship and disappearing into the asteroid belt. He grabbed\nthe intercom and bawled orders.\n\n\"Power deck, emergency space speed. Control deck, relay that order to\nevery ship converging on the _Avenger's_ position!\"\n\n\"What's up, sir?\" asked Tom from below.\n\n\"One of the ships has spotted Coxine. He's apparently still out of\ncommission, but we're too far away to hail him.\"\n\nStrong began to pace the deck of the radar bridge, and with each turn,\nhe glanced at the radar scanner where Roger was waiting anxiously for\nthe telltale blip of the _Avenger_ to appear.\n\nSuddenly the blond-haired cadet stiffened. He peered at the scanner\nscreen, then cried, \"There he is, sir!\" His finger pointed to a white\noutline on the scanner.\n\nStrong took a quick look at the pirate's position and compared it to the\npositions of the converging fleet. He turned to the teleceiver and\nsignaled for the immediate attention of all ships.\n\n\"This is Strong aboard the flagship _Polaris_! All ships will proceed\naccording to attack plan seventeen--code nine. Use full power! Emergency\nthrust!\"\n\nAs the minutes passed and the Solar Guard fleet plunged forward, the\nships forged a solid wall of guns around the drifting pirate vessel.\nFrom above, below, and almost every compass point on the plan of the\necliptic, they closed in, deadly blasters aimed, gunners ready to fire.\n\n\"We've got him, sir!\" breathed Roger. \"He can't escape now! Not in a\nmillion light years!\"\n\nCaptain Strong didn't reply. Eyes were glued to the scanner, watching\nthe target and the Solar Guard squadrons, searching for every possible\nloophole in the trap. Suddenly he spoke into the teleceiver.\n\n\"Attention all ships! Maintain present range, reduce speed, and take\nenglobement formation!\"\n\nIn reply, the elements of the fleet smoothly reformed until they formed\na giant wheel in space with the pirate ship as the hub. Around and\naround they flew, all inboard guns trained on the enemy.\n\nAs the command ship, the _Polaris_ flew high over the formation. Strong\nchecked the formation carefully on the scanner and nodded his\nsatisfaction.\n\n\"I think we've done it now, Manning,\" he sighed. \"Coxine doesn't have a\nchance of breaking through.\"\n\nRoger looked unhappy. \"Ah, it was too easy, sir,\" he grumbled. \"I was\ncounting on having some fun.\"\n\n\"After all these weeks of heartache, I'll skip the fun if you don't\nmind,\" said Strong wryly and turned to the intercom. \"Tom, check in!\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir!\"\n\n\"Head for the _Avenger_. Close in!\"\n\n\"You mean we're going to lead the attack, sir?\" Tom shouted in a sudden\nburst of enthusiasm.\n\n\"From the looks of things, I don't believe an attack will be necessary,\"\nreplied Strong. \"We're going alongside to accept Coxine's surrender.\nStart blasting!\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, _sir_!\"\n\nAs Tom's voice was heard over the intercom speaker, issuing orders to\nAstro for change of course, Strong turned back to Roger.\n\n\"Open up the audioceiver to all-wave transmission!\"\n\n\"You going to talk to Coxine, sir?\"\n\n\"Yes. And I hope he'll listen. If he doesn't, I'll do my talking with\nsix-inch blasters!\"\n\nRoger quickly adjusted the settings on the audioceiver and then turned\nto his skipper.\n\n\"She's all yours, sir. Give it to him good!\"\n\nStrong smiled thinly and picked up the microphone.\n\n\"Attention, Bull Coxine! Attention, Bull Coxine!\" Strong's voice was\ncold and hard. \"This is Captain Strong of the Solar Guard! You're\nsurrounded. You haven't a chance of escape. I demand your unconditional\nsurrender! Acknowledge immediately!\"\n\nStrong flipped the key to open the receiver and waited for the reply.\nRoger moved closer, his eyes glued to the image of the pirate ship\nlooming larger and larger on the scanner.\n\nFifteen seconds passed. Thirty. There was no sound over the receiver.\nSweat began to bead Strong's forehead and he opened the transmitter key\nagain.\n\n\"Listen, Coxine! I know you can hear me! I'll only talk to you once\nmore! Surrender or you'll be blasted into protons! I'll give you exactly\nthirty seconds to make up your mind!\"\n\nAgain Strong opened the receiver key and waited, but as the seconds\nticked by, there was no answer.\n\n\"Sir, do you think he's sucking us into a trap?\" Roger whispered.\n\n\"Maybe,\" replied Strong grimly. \"But he knows what would happen to him\nif he opened fire.\"\n\n\"Captain Strong! Captain Strong!\" Tom's voice suddenly blared over the\nship's intercom.\n\n\"Don't bother me now, Corbett,\" replied Strong irritably.\n\n\"But, sir,\" Tom persisted, \"that isn't the _Avenger_!\"\n\n\"What!\" Strong was thunderstruck.\n\n\"No, sir,\" continued the young cadet. \"I'm looking at her right now on\nmy control-deck scanner. It's the same model ship as the _Avenger_, but\nit isn't Coxine's!\"\n\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\n\"Positive, sir. I was on her long enough to know.\"\n\n\"Blast it! Then what--?\"\n\nRoger suddenly interrupted Strong. \"Sir, look at her over the\nmagnascope! She's been abandoned!\"\n\nThe Solar Guard captain quickly turned to the magnascope screen. There\nhe saw a close-up view of the target. It was a helpless derelict. All\nemergency ports were open and the jet-boat locks were empty.\n\nStrong's face grew pale and he slumped back in his chair.\n\n\"What--what do you suppose happened, sir?\" asked Roger hesitantly.\n\n\"It's easy enough to figure,\" Strong replied, his voice dull and\nlifeless. \"Coxine is using more than one ship now. And when this one was\ndamaged, he simply transferred to another one. He's outfoxed us again!\"\n\nSlowly, with wooden legs, he walked over to the teleceiver.\n\n\"Attention all ships! Resume former search stations. All we've caught\nhere is a red herring!\"\n\nAnd as the powerful engines of the _Polaris_ picked up speed, Strong\nimagined he could hear Gargantuan laughter echoing in space around him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 17\n\n\n\"Spaceman's luck, sir,\" said Tom, shaking Captain Strong's hand.\n\nSilently the other two cadets in turn gripped their skipper's hand\ntightly.\n\n\"Thanks, boys,\" said Strong. \"If we're going to get that space crawler,\nwe have to trap him. And the best bait I know is a twenty-million-credit\npay roll.\"\n\n\"But won't you take at least one man with you, sir?\" pleaded Tom.\n\"Sitting up there in space in a decoy ship waiting for Coxine is\nlike--\" Tom paused. \"Well, you won't have much of a chance, sir, if\nCoxine opens fire before asking questions.\"\n\n\"That's the risk I've got to take, Tom,\" said Strong. \"It took a lot of\ntalking to get Commander Walters' permission to try this. But we've got\nto force Coxine to come out far enough from the asteroid belt to catch\nhim before he can run back in and lose himself again.\" The young captain\nsmiled wanly and added, \"Don't think that your job is unimportant!\"\n\nTom, Roger, and Astro nodded. On their return from the unsuccessful\nattempt to capture Coxine, they had been suddenly faced with the routine\nduty of transporting a twenty-million-credit pay roll from Atom City to\nthe satellite of Titan for the crystal miners.\n\nThinking one sure way to catch any rat was to use a lure, Tom suggested\nthat the Titan armored freighter be used as a decoy to capture the\npirate, and the cadets could carry the pay roll in the _Polaris_.\n\nCommander Walters had considered the plan, and then realizing that\nCoxine might fire on the freighter before seizing it, disapproved of\nplacing a full crew aboard the lightly armed ship. Instead, he would\nsend only one man. Strong had volunteered for the assignment and had\npersuaded the commander to allow him to man the decoy ship.\n\nNow, the two ships, the _Polaris_ and the armed freighter stood side by\nside at the Academy spaceport, and the three cadets and their commanding\nofficer waited for the signal to blast off.\n\n\"You have your course for your trip out to Titan, Tom?\" asked Strong.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Tom. \"We're to blast off later to-night and take a\ncourse through the asteroid belt, traveling on the plane of the\necliptic. As soon as we get through, we are to proceed under full\nemergency thrust to our destination.\"\n\nStrong nodded his head, satisfied.\n\n\"Do you think Coxine will come out after you, sir?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"We've tried to make sure that he will, Roger,\" replied Strong. \"It's\npretty common knowledge that the Titan pay-roll ship leaves every month,\nand that it travels a different route each time. Sometimes it goes\nthrough the asteroid belt on the plane of the ecliptic and sometimes it\ngoes over. We believe Coxine knows this, and with the thinly guised\nmessages we've sent to Titan, we're hoping he'll try for it.\"\n\n\"But how will you get him, sir?\" asked Astro, puzzled. \"I mean, with no\narmor on the freighter to speak of, and no crew aboard, how can you nail\nhim before he gets you?\"\n\n\"Hyperdrive,\" replied the captain laconically.\n\n\"Hyperdrive?\" echoed Tom quizzically.\n\n\"I'm going to take the decoy ship through the asteroid belt too, but\nthrough a different area, closer to the part we think Coxine is\noperating in. Seven full squadrons have blasted off ahead of me and\ntaken up positions in that area. When and if Coxine attacks, I'll alert\nthe waiting ships, who'll come in on hyperdrive. By the time Coxine\nspots them on his radar, they'll be on top of him.\"\n\n\"Then,\" ventured Tom, \"you're staking your life on the ships arriving\nbefore Coxine can attack.\"\n\n\"That's right, Tom,\" said Strong. \"If our plan works, we catch Coxine.\nIf it doesn't, at least we know that the Titan pay roll is safe. That's\nwhy your job is as important as mine.\"\n\nThey were interrupted by the ground-crew chief who reported the decoy\nship ready to blast off.\n\nStrong nodded and the three cadets gripped their captain's hand again.\nTurning, he climbed into the freighter and five minutes later the Solar\nGuard officer blasted off from the Academy spaceport while Tom, Roger,\nand Astro watched from the traffic-control tower.\n\n\"Come on,\" said Tom. \"It'll be two hours before we can blast off. We\nmight as well get some sleep. We'll need it.\"\n\nReluctantly, Roger and Astro followed their unit-mate from the traffic\ntower, their eyes full of concern for their skipper. Each was grimly\naware that they might never see their skipper alive again.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Now shut your traps!\" roared Bull Coxine. \"The next crawler that opens\nhis mouth gets taken apart!\" He stood on top of a table and faced his\ncrew of pirates who were sitting about swilling large cups of rocket\njuice.\n\nThe room in which the giant pirate spaceman had gathered his men was one\nof many in a building constructed since their arrival from the prison\nasteroid. Hidden from even the closest inspection by the smaller bodies\ncircling around the main asteroid, Coxine had expanded the small hut\nused by Wallace and Simms into a huge rambling building containing\narmories, machine shops, and storage rooms packed with everything he and\nhis murderous crew might need.\n\nNow with a string of successful raids behind them and their personal\npocketbooks bulging with stolen credits and valuables, the crew of\npirates waited attentively while their cruel but brilliant leader\noutlined the most daring plan of all.\n\n\"Now listen,\" roared Coxine. \"There's a few things I want to say before\nwe start on the plans of the next strike!\"\n\nThe big spaceman paused and glared at the men in front of him. \"Ever\nsince that space-crawling cadet pulled a fast one on me there's been\ntalk about voting for another leader!\" He spat the word as if it had\nleft a foul taste in his mouth. \"Well, get this. There'll be no voting!\nI'm the boss of this outfit! Any man who thinks he can take over my\njob,\" Coxine's voice dropped to a deadly whisper, \"_just let him try!_\"\n\nStony silence greeted the huge spaceman, a silence inspired by fear.\n\n\"Now!\" roared Coxine, his coarse features changing from a scowl to a\nbroad grin. \"The strike!\"\n\nThis was greeted with a roar of approval. The men demanded action after\na week of idleness on the asteroid.\n\n\"Wallace!\" yelled Coxine.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" answered the spaceman, stepping up to the table and facing\nCoxine.\n\n\"We'll take up a position in the asteroid belt, here!\" He placed a\nfinger on a map of the belt. \"Simms!\" roared the giant spaceman.\n\n\"Yes, sir!\" the wizened space pirate stepped forward.\n\n\"You remember that rocket scout we blasted? The one that got our other\nship?\"\n\n\"I sure do, sir.\"\n\n\"It's drifting around in orbit near asteroid seventeen. Take a crew of\nmen and a few jet boats and go get her. Bring her back here and fix her\nup. Strip every pound of excess weight off her. I want a ship that'll\nfly faster than anything in the system and I want it in twenty-four\nhours.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" gulped Simms. \"But then what'll I do with her?\"\n\n\"After you've done what I've already told you to do,\" snapped Coxine,\n\"I'll tell you more!\"\n\nSimms' face turned red, and he nodded curtly.\n\n\"Now as for the rest of you crawlers,\" said Coxine, facing the room full\nof men. \"Repair crews have been assigned for work on the rocket scout\nand the rest of you will work on the _Avenger_ and prepare her for a\nlong flight. I want the three-inch blasters, every paralo-ray gun and\nrifle, the fuel tanks, food supplies, oxygen circulators, in fact\neverything checked, rechecked, and _double-checked_!\"\n\nJoe Brooks, who had become a favorite of Coxine's, rose and faced the\npirate captain. \"Where are we going to strike next, skipper?\"\n\nCoxine looked at the man with a half-smile playing on his lips. \"This\noperation will have two parts, Joe. The first--well--\" his smiled\nbroadened--\"the Titan pay-roll ship just blasted off from Space Academy.\nFor the last ten years, the Titan pay-roll ship has been blasting off\nfrom Atom City. Now why do you think it would suddenly leave from Space\nAcademy, the home of the Solar Guard?\"\n\nThe crowd of men murmured their bewilderment.\n\n\"I'll tell you why!\" bawled Coxine. \"Either they have that ship so\npacked with blasters it would take a fleet to stop it, or it's a trap!\"\n\n\"But if you think it's a trap,\" exclaimed Wallace, \"you're not going to\nhit it, are you?\"\n\n\"I said it _might_ be a trap!\" snapped Coxine. \"But it might not and\nwith twenty million credits to be had for the taking, I'm not going to\nlet her breeze through. I'm going to make sure it's a trap before I try\nsomething else!\"\n\n\"But how?\" persisted Wallace.\n\nCoxine looked at his lieutenant coldly. He had indulged the man too\nlong. \"I'll tell you when I get good and ready! Now all of you, get out\nof here and make sure everything, and I _mean everything_, is ready to\nraise ship at a moment's notice!\"\n\nThe men got up and shuffled from the room. Coxine turned to his two\nlieutenants. \"All right, Wallace, see that those crawlers do what I told\nthem to do. And you, Simms, get after that rocket scout.\"\n\nThe two spacemen saluted their captain and turned away. Coxine watched\nthem leave the room, already planning his next move, a move calculated\nto be so surprising that the Solar Guard would be absolutely helpless.\n\nBull Coxine smiled and turned to study the charts of the asteroid belt.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAlone aboard the armored decoy ship, Captain Strong blasted steadily on\nhis course through the asteroid belt. The young Solar Guard officer was\naware that at any moment after reaching the celestial jungle of small\nplanetoids he could be fired on without warning. And though the Solar\nGuard patrol ships, well hidden in the belt, would blast Coxine out of\nexistence, it would still be too late for him.\n\nGrim-faced, his hands gripping the controls, he rocketed through space,\ndetermined to put an end, once and for all, to the marauding pirate and\nold enemy, Bull Coxine.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen night fell over the Academy spaceport, Tom, Roger, and Astro\nclimbed silently into the giant rocket cruiser _Polaris_ and raised ship\nfor Titan. Their departure from Earth was routine, with no one but\nCommander Walters and Captain Strong knowing that stowed in the storage\ncompartment of the spaceship was twenty million credits, the pay roll\nfor the miners of Titan.\n\nOnce in space, the rocket ship was put on course and held there by\nautomatic pilot. The three cadets gathered in the messroom and sipped\nhot tea, staring moodily into their cups. Unable to break audio silence,\nlest they should betray their position, their first chance of hearing\nany news lay far ahead of them at Titan. They could only hope that the\ndecoy trap would succeed and that their skipper and friend would return\nsafely. The only comment was Astro's grim prediction.\n\n\"If anything happens to Captain Strong,\" he paused and finished his\nsentence in a tense whisper, \"I'll search the universe until I find\nCoxine. And when I do, I'll break him in two!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 18\n\n\n\"Have you got everything straight?\" asked Coxine. Simms nodded his head.\n\n\"All right, blast off,\" ordered the pirate. \"We'll follow you and keep\nyou spotted on radar. If it's a trap, head for asteroid fourteen, bail\nout in a jet boat, and let the scout keep going. We'll pick you up\nlater.\"\n\nSimms nodded again and turned to his old partner, Wallace. \"So long,\nGus.\" He smiled. \"This is one time the Solar Guard gets it right where\nit hurts!\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" agreed Wallace. \"See you later. Take it easy on that asteroid\nand don't get in trouble with the girls!\"\n\nThe two men laughed and Simms turned to climb into the waiting rocket\nscout. The sleek ship had been stripped down until it was hardly more\nthan a power deck and control panel. She was now capable of more than\ntwice her original speed. As the little spaceman disappeared into the\nair lock, Coxine turned to Wallace.\n\n\"We'll give him an hour's head start and then blast off after him. And\nremember, the first man that breaks audio silence will get blasted!\"\n\nAll eyes were on the tiny rocket scout as its jets, roaring into life,\nlifted free of the pirate planetoid. When the speedy little ship had\ndisappeared into space, Coxine turned to his crew and ordered an\nimmediate alert. While the criminals readied the armed privateer for\nblast-off, Coxine and Wallace climbed directly to the radar bridge.\n\nJoe Brooks was hunched in front of the scanner, staring intently. He\nlooked up when the two pirate officers entered.\n\n\"Just following Lieutenant Simms on the radar, skipper,\" said Brooks.\n\"He's blasting through the asteroid belt faster than I thought he\ncould.\"\n\n\"Lemme see!\" growled Coxine. The giant pirate stared at the scanner and\nhis mouth twisted into a grin. He turned away and barked several orders.\n\"Wallace, stand by to blast off in two minutes! Brooks, get me a bearing\non that ship.\"\n\n\"You mean Simms?\" asked the radarman.\n\n\"No! I mean that ship, right there,\" snapped Coxine. He pointed to a\nwhite blip on the scanner. \"And after you get the bearing I want a\ncourse that'll intersect it in\"--Coxine paused and glanced at the astral\nchronometer--\"ten minutes!\"\n\nQuickly calculating the bearing and working up the course as ordered,\nBrooks handed Coxine a slip of paper. The pirate glanced at it briefly.\n\n\"What would you say Simms' speed would be if he kept his ship on full\nthrust, Brooks?\" asked Coxine.\n\nBrooks thought a moment. \"I'd say it would be about half of what he's\nmaking now!\"\n\n\"Exactly!\" roared Coxine. \"That's why the ship on your scanner isn't\nSimms' at all, but another ship!\"\n\nThe radarman studied the scanner, where, with each sweep of the thin\nwhite line, the blip of the ship appeared. \"You mean it might be the\nTitan pay roll?\" he breathed hopefully.\n\n\"Yeah,\" breathed Coxine. \"I mean it might be the Titan pay roll, and\nthen again it might not!\" Coxine turned away, leaving the radarman\nutterly confused.\n\nWithin the two-minute deadline that Coxine had ordered, the members of\nhis crew were locking the last air lock and securing ship for blast-off.\nCoxine sat in front of the control panel, ready to give the final order\nthat would send the vessel hurtling into space. In a little while, the\nevil mind, the twisted brain of Bull Coxine would be pitted against the\nmight of the Solar Guard.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCaptain Strong sat on the control deck of the decoy ship, watching the\nradar scanner and waiting for the appearance of Bull Coxine and his\ncrew. Again and again, the young Solar Guard officer, too restless to\nremain in one spot, got up and paced the deck.\n\nHe flipped on a chart screen and studied the positions of the\nsurrounding asteroids, which he knew hid the Solar Guard fleet, ready to\npounce on any attacking ship. Schooled for years in facing the tedium of\nspace travel and patrolling the space lanes, Strong nevertheless was\nanxious for something to happen, as minute after minute slipped past and\nno attack came.\n\nOnce he thought he saw something move on the scanner and gripped the\nsides of the instrument tightly as a blip appeared, disappeared, and\nthen reappeared. Finally Strong was able to distinguish what it was and\nhe turned away in disgust. It had been a maverick asteroid, one which,\nbecause of its positive gravity, never became a captive of other bodies\nin space. It wandered aimlessly through the belt, a danger spacemen\nfeared more than any other, since it could not be depended upon to\nremain in one position.\n\nUnable to break audio silence and communicate with the hidden Solar\nGuard fleet around him, lest he give away their positions, Strong found\nthe loneliness driving him into a case of jitters and nerves.\n\nSuddenly he jumped up and stared unbelievingly at the scanner. There in\nfront of him was a blip, traveling at amazing speed, straight for his\nship. From its size and shape, Strong could tell it was a rocket scout.\nHe watched it for a moment dumfounded at the speed of the small ship.\nWhen he was certain that it was heading for him, he grabbed the\naudioceiver microphone and began calling hurriedly.\n\n\"Attention all ships! This is Captain Strong. Spaceship approaching me,\nstarboard quarter, one-one-five degrees. Estimated speed--\" Strong\npaused and watched the moving blip. \"Speed unknown. All ships close in\nimmediately!\"\n\nOn the scanner, Strong could see the flashes of blips as the squadrons\nroared out of concealment and closed in on the approaching rocket scout.\nOver the audioceiver he could hear the squadron commanders snapping\norders to their ships as the small ship still headed, unheedingly, for\nhis decoy vessel.\n\nSuddenly the attacking ship slowed and Strong could see the blip turn in\na wide-sweeping curve. But it was too late. The Solar Guard ships had it\nsurrounded from every possible angle. The little scout made a desperate\ndash straight for Strong's ship. In a flash, he saw the plan of the\nship's pilot. He was heading for Strong, hoping to use him as a shield\nfrom the mighty six-inch blasters trained on him.\n\nStrong grabbed for the control and fired full thrust on his starboard\njets, sending the decoy vessel into a screaming dive. The attacking ship\ntried to follow, but seeing it couldn't make it, turned and tried to\nescape from the surrounding ships. Instinctively Strong shouted a\nwarning to the pilot to surrender, but even as he spoke, he saw the\nfiring flashes sparkle on the hulls of a dozen fleet vessels as they\nsent their deadly atomic missiles converging like lightning arrows on\nthe speedy rocket scout.\n\nThere was a burst of pure white fire on the scanner and then the young\ncaptain gulped as the attacking ship was blasted into a hulk of twisted\nmetal.\n\nStrong grabbed the audioceiver microphone and shouted orders to the\nfleet squadron leaders.\n\n\" ... Squadron L! Put out immediate rescue jet boats and begin salvage\noperations. All remaining ships will return to Solar Guard base, Space\nAcademy. End transmission!\"\n\nStrong hurried to the air lock, hastily put on a space suit, and in a\nfew moments was blasting in a jet boat toward the remains of the\nattacking scout.\n\nImmediately the communications of the departing fleet were filled with\ntalk of their victory over the pirate band. Strong alone felt uneasy\nabout their success. For Coxine to attack in a light rocket scout, which\nStrong felt sure had been stripped down to gain more speed, did not\nfollow the pattern which the hardened pirate had established in previous\nraids.\n\nWhen he arrived at the wreckage of the rocket scout, Strong found that\nhis fears were justified.\n\nA crew chief from one of the rescue squads approached Strong; his body\nweightless in space, the man grappled for a handhold on a jutting piece\nof the twisted wreck, and then spoke to Strong over the helmet\nspacephones.\n\n\"We found only one person aboard, sir,\" he reported. \"And the ship\nappears to have been stripped of everything but engines and control\npanel.\"\n\nBehind the protective glass of his helmet, Strong grimaced. He turned to\nCaptain Randolph. \"We've been tricked again, Randy,\" said Strong\nbitterly. \"We used a decoy and so did Coxine!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"They're closing in!\" Roger's voice crackled through the intercom from\nthe radar bridge. \"Do we fight or do we let those space crawlers take\nover?\"\n\n\"Fight!\" bellowed Astro from the power deck.\n\n\"No! Wait!\" cried Tom. \"We haven't a chance! If we don't heave to,\nCoxine'll blast us into space junk!\"\n\nRocketing through the asteroid belt with the Titan pay roll, the three\nspace cadets, under strict orders to maintain communications silence,\nwere unaware that Bull Coxine had outsmarted Captain Strong. Sending in\nthe rocket scout, he had sprung the Solar Guard trap and had cagily\nscanned the belt for another ship. Finding the _Polaris_ easily, the\npirate captain was blasting in for the attack.\n\nOn the control deck of the Solar Guard cruiser, Tom Corbett desperately\ntried to think of a plan to outwit Coxine, while his unit-mates urged\nhim to fight back.\n\n\"What's the matter, Junior?\" Roger called over the intercom\nsarcastically. \"Scared to fight?\"\n\n\"You know I'm not,\" snapped Tom in reply.\n\n\"By the rings of Saturn,\" growled Astro, \"I never thought you'd\nsurrender to anybody, Tom!\"\n\n\"Listen, both of you!\" shouted Tom. \"It's no use! We've got to play this\nsmart!\"\n\n\"Well, start making with the brains,\" sneered Roger. \"Coxine's in range\nnow.\"\n\n\"Attention--\" A harsh unmistakable voice rumbled over the audioceiver.\n\"This is Bull Coxine! Heave to or you'll be blasted!\"\n\n\"All right, Junior,\" said Roger bitterly, \"company's coming. What now?\"\n\n\"Cut all power, Astro--fast!\" ordered Tom.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" growled Astro. \"Afraid they'll shoot if you don't\nstop fast enough?\"\n\n\"Keep your big trap shut and do as I tell you!\" snapped Tom.\n\n\"Listen, Junior!\" snarled Roger. \"As far as I'm concerned--\"\n\nTom interrupted him. \"_You_ listen, you idiot! Don't you see what's\nhappened? Coxine must have found out about the decoy ship, and when we\nshowed up on his scanner, he figured right away that we might have the\nTitan pay roll.\"\n\n\"So what?\" demanded Roger. \"That still doesn't let you off for not\nbelting that crawler with our six-inchers!\"\n\n\"Use your head!\" snapped Tom. \"With the Solar Guard squadrons on the\nother side of the belt and with no gun crews on our ship, how far do you\nthink we'd have gotten?\"\n\n\"You didn't have to surrender, Tom,\" said Astro. \"I could have outrun\nCoxine in nothing flat. Why, I haven't got half the speed out of this\nold girl I think she's got.\"\n\n\"A great idea, bird brain! Run away from the very guy the Solar Guard's\ngoing crazy trying to find!\"\n\nThe intercom was suddenly silent as Astro and Roger began to understand\nTom's decision and waited for him to elaborate on his idea.\n\n\"Now, listen, Roger,\" said Tom patiently, \"we've got about five minutes\nbefore those crawlers will be aboard. How long will it take you to make\na signal beacon that'll send out a constant automatic SOS?\"\n\n\"A what?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"Beacon. One that will transmit on the Solar Guard special frequency and\nbe small enough to hide here on the _Polaris_.\"\n\n\"Why hide it on the _Polaris_?\" asked Astro. \"Why not try to get it on\ntheir ship?\" His tone was almost apologetic now that he realized Tom was\nnot planning a cowardly surrender.\n\n\"It's a cinch they'll take the _Polaris_ over,\" explained Tom. \"She's\nfast and she's got six-inch blasters.\"\n\n\"I get it!\" yelped Astro. \"We plant the beacon on the _Polaris_, and\nwhen they take her over, the signal will be going out all the time.\"\nAstro paused. \"But wait a minute. They'll be sure to search the ship\nfirst!\"\n\n\"First things first, Astro,\" answered Tom. \"Roger, can you make the\nbeacon?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Roger, \"but it'll take me at least a half hour!\"\n\n\"You've got to finish it faster than that!\" Tom insisted.\n\n\"I can't, Tom. I just can't.\"\n\n\"All right, then we'll have to stall as best we can. Get to work.\nMeantime, Astro and I will find a place to hide it. How big do you think\nit'll be?\"\n\nThere was a momentary pause and then Roger replied, \"No smaller than six\ninches. About like a shoe box.\"\n\n\"Could you make it three inches thick, and longer, instead of\nbox-shaped?\"\n\nRoger hesitated again. \"Yeah, I guess so. Why?\"\n\n\"Because I just thought of a good place to hide it. They'd have to tear\nthe ship apart to find it, _if_ they even hear the signal!\"\n\n\"Attention! Attention! This is Coxine--\" The pirate's voice bawled over\nthe audioceiver again. \"You are under my guns. Stand by to receive a\nboarding party. If you make any attempt to escape, you will be blasted!\"\n\nTom grabbed the microphone to the audioceiver and replied, \"Orders\nunderstood, but you'll have to wait until we can build up air pressure\nin the air lock.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Coxine. \"We'll give you fifteen minutes.\"\n\nTom thought desperately. \"You'll have to wait at least a half hour. We\nbroke a valve and have to replace it!\"\n\nCoxine's voice became suspicious. \"Hey, what're you trying to pull?\"\n\n\"Honest, Mister Coxine,\" whined Tom, \"we're not doing anything.\"\n\n\"Fifteen minutes,\" roared Coxine, \"or I blast a hole in your ship!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\" answered Tom, fully aware that the pirate captain would\ncarry out his threat.\n\nDropping the audioceiver microphone, the young cadet hurried to the\npower deck, where Astro waited impatiently.\n\n\"Grab a couple of cutting torches, Astro,\" he said, \"and get me a\nlead-lined suit. I'm going into the reactant chamber.\"\n\n\"What?\" demanded Astro.\n\n\"You heard me! I'm going to hide that beacon where they'll never find\nit.\"\n\n\"In the reactant chamber?\" asked Astro. \"Impossible!\"\n\n\"Remember when we first arrived at the prison asteroid? How thoroughly\nwe were searched?\"\n\nAstro nodded.\n\n\"Remember, they even searched the space between the inner and outer\nhulls? There's three inches of clearance in there. If I cut into that\nspace through the reactant chamber and put the beacon inside, the noise\nof the jets will keep Coxine from hearing it, and the radioactivity in\nthe chamber will keep them from picking it up on their detectors!\"\n\nAstro's face spread into a wide grin, and without another word, he began\npreparing the cutting torches. Ten minutes later Tom emerged from the\nchamber and nodded triumphantly. \"All set, Astro! Now all we need is the\nbeacon.\"\n\nSuddenly the _Polaris_ was rocked by a heavy explosion.\n\n\"They're firing!\" yelled Astro.\n\n\"Roger! Have you finished the beacon?\" demanded Tom over the intercom.\n\n\"I need another five minutes!\" answered Roger. \"I have to set the signal\nto send out the SOS.\"\n\n\"Will it send out _anything_?\" asked Tom.\n\nThe _Polaris_ rocked again from a second explosion.\n\n\"I don't know, Tom,\" yelled Roger. \"I haven't even tested it!\"\n\nA third explosion jarred the rocket cruiser and the curly-haired cadet\nknew that the air lock must have been demolished by now.\n\n\"Bring down what you've got, Roger!\" he yelled. \"We'll just have to take\na chance that it'll work. And grab yourself a space suit on the way\ndown. When they blast through the inner portal of the lock, we'll need\n'em!\"\n\n\"Right!\" replied Roger. \"Be down there in a second.\"\n\nAstro and Tom hurriedly donned space suits and waited for Roger to bring\nthe beacon. In a moment the blond-haired cadet appeared with the\nhurriedly contrived beacon. Tom quickly placed it between the two hulls\nand sealed the hole in the inner hull.\n\nA fourth explosion rocked the ship and the three cadets knew that by now\nthe air lock had been blasted away. They put on their space helmets and\nclimbed the ladder to the upper deck.\n\nCoxine met them near the air lock, two paralo-ray guns clutched in his\ngloved hands. Behind him, his crew swarmed in and fanned out all over\nthe ship.\n\nBut the space pirate stood on the control deck, glaring at Tom. \"Whaddya\nknow! The Space Kid himself!\"\n\n\"That's right, Coxine,\" said Tom quietly, \"only the real name is\nCorbett.\"\n\nSuddenly there was a triumphant shout from one of the pirates. \"Skipper!\nThe credits! All twenty million! We found 'em!\"\n\nOver their spacephones the three cadets could hear the pirates yelling\nand cheering. Coxine bellowed for silence and the cheering quickly\nsubsided.\n\nPaying no further attention to the three cadets, the pirate captain\nordered his men to repair the hole in the air lock and prepare for\nimmediate acceleration. There was a triumphant gleam in his eyes as he\nannounced their destination.\n\n\"With the Solar Guard on the other side of the belt, we're going to hit\nthe richest prize in the universe! The colony on Ganymede!\"\n\nHe then turned and smiled at his three prisoners, adding menacingly,\n\"And we've got three passes to get us through the defenses!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 19\n\n\nGanymede, the largest moon of Jupiter, was an important way station of\nthe Solar Alliance for all spaceships traveling between the outer\nplanets of Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto and the inner planets of\nMars, Earth, Venus, and Mercury. The colony on Ganymede was more of a\nsupply depot than a permanent settlement, with one large uranium\nrefinery to convert the pitchblende brought in by the prospectors of the\nasteroids. Refueling ships, replenishing supplies, and having a small\ntourist trade, it was a quiet colony, one of many spread throughout the\nsystem.\n\nWith the Solar Guard search squadrons hopelessly out of range on the\nother side of the asteroid belt, the cadets' only hope of saving the\ntiny colony lay in the beacon hidden inside the hull of the _Polaris_.\n\nLeaving Wallace and half of his crew aboard the _Polaris_, Bull Coxine\nhad transferred the three cadets to the Avenger and thrown them into the\nbrig. As the ship accelerated toward the colony, Tom stared out of the\nsmall, barred viewport while Roger and Astro sprawled glumly on the hard\nbunks.\n\nRoger finally broke the heavy silence. \"What do you suppose Coxine meant\nwhen he said he had three passes into Ganymede?\"\n\n\"Give you one guess, pal,\" snorted Astro.\n\n\"He obviously expects us to give him the recognition signal,\" said Tom.\n\nRoger sighed. \"That's what I figured. But I was hoping I was wrong.\"\n\n\"At least we're all immune to truth drugs,\" said Astro hopefully. \"He\nwon't get the recognition code out of us that way.\"\n\n\"That dirty space crawler wouldn't even bother with drugs,\" muttered\nRoger. \"They aren't enough fun. He likes to get what he wants the hard\nway.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" agreed Tom. \"We're in for a rough time, guys.\"\n\nThey all looked at each other, fully aware of what lay in score for\nthem. Finally Astro growled, \"I don't care what he does to me. I won't\ntell him a thing!\"\n\n\"Same here!\" exclaimed Roger.\n\nTom merely nodded, his face a grim, expressionless mask.\n\nSuddenly three men led by Brooks, the radar operator, appeared in the\npassageway outside the brig. Brooks stepped forward, opened the door,\nand gestured with the paralo-ray gun in his hand.\n\n\"All right, you punks! Outside!\"\n\nAstro started to lunge for the pirate, but Tom grabbed him by the arm.\n\"Take it easy, Astro. That won't get us any place.\"\n\n\"You can say that again,\" sneered Brooks. \"One crazy move like that,\nkid, and I'll freeze you solid as a cake of ice! Now come on! Move!\"\n\nTom, followed by Astro and Roger, walked slowly out of the brig, and\nguarded closely by the three pirate crewmen they were taken to the main\nair lock.\n\n\"All right,\" said Brooks. \"The big ox and blondie, get in there!\"\n\nOne of the crewmen opened the air-lock portal while the other two jabbed\nAstro and Roger with ray guns. The two cadets stumbled into the chamber\nand the door was slammed behind them.\n\n\"Lock it!\" snarled Brooks.\n\nWhen the men had secured the portal, Brooks turned and pushed Tom\nroughly along the passageway. A moment later they reached the control\ndeck where Bull Coxine was hunched over his charts.\n\n\"Here he is, Captain,\" said Brooks. \"The other two are sealed up in the\nair lock like sardines!\"\n\nCoxine nodded and faced Tom, a thin smile on his face. \"I told you I\nwould get the recognition signal, Corbett,\" he said. \"And I will!\"\nCoxine walked over to a large valve on the after bulkhead and tapped the\nneedle indicator right beside it. Satisfied, he turned back to the\ncadet.\n\n\"In two hours,\" began Coxine, \"we'll be within range of the Ganymede\ngarrison and its radar. It takes exactly eight turns on this valve to\nbleed the air out of the air lock where your two buddies are. So, every\nfifteen minutes I'm going to ask you for the recognition signal, and\nevery time you say no, I'll turn the valve once. By the time we get\nclose enough to Ganymede to be picked up on their radar, you'll either\nhave given me the signal or your buddies will be dead!\"\n\nTom stood listening to Coxine, his blood boiling at the giant spaceman's\ncruelty. Suddenly he tore across the control deck and made a dive for\nCoxine's neck. But the big man met him coming on and with a powerful\nslap of his hand sent the boy sprawling back across the deck.\n\n\"You're a good man, Corbett,\" said Coxine, standing over the fallen\ncadet, \"but you're a _little_ man, and a good big man can lick a good\nlittle man any time!\"\n\nBrooks and the crewmen laughed loudly as Tom dragged himself to his\nfeet.\n\n\"Well, do I get the signal?\" demanded Coxine. \"Or do your buddies get a\nlittle less air?\"\n\nStanding unsteadily on his feet, with four paralo-ray guns trained on\nhis body, Tom thought quickly of Roger and Astro, alone in the darkness\nof the air lock, soon to be clawing their throats for air; of the\nmerciless attack on the prison asteroid; of the helpless ships Coxine\nhad looted. All these things and more flashed through the curly-haired\ncadet's mind as he weighed his life and the lives of his unit-mates\nagainst an attack that would devastate the small satellite of Jupiter.\nTom could see through the pirate's demand for the recognition signal.\nOnce inside the Ganymede radar screen, he could attack the Solar Guard\ngarrison and wipe it out before it could raise a ship in defense.\n\n\"Well?\" demanded Coxine, placing his huge hand on the valve.\n\nTom knew that if he could stall long enough, the signal aboard the\n_Polaris_ might be picked up by the Solar Guard. Roger and Astro were in\ngood physical condition. They could conserve their energy as soon as\nthey discovered the trap. He had to stall and hope the signal would be\npicked up in time.\n\n\"The only thing I'll ever give you, Coxine,\" said Tom through clenched\nteeth, \"is a blast of a paralo-ray!\"\n\nCoxine snarled in anger and turned the valve, shouting, \"One more thing,\n_Mister Hero_! The minute the air lock is empty, _you_ take a swim in\nspace too!\"\n\nTom was prepared for that. He knew the pirate would not take defeat at\nthe hands of a Space Cadet easily. Tom was resigned to his fate. He was\nready to accept anything if it would serve the purpose of ridding the\nsolar system of Bull Coxine.\n\n\"Tie him to that chair,\" snarled the giant pirate captain. \"And make\nsure he's secure, or you'll go swimming in space with him!\"\n\nTom was shoved roughly into the copilot's chair in front of the control\nboard and tied down with a thick rope. He winced as the heavy line dug\ninto his arms. After inspecting the job, Coxine dismissed Brooks and the\nmen with a curt nod and returned to his charts.\n\nTom sat in front of the control panel, his eyes sweeping the gauges and\ndials and at last fixing on the master acceleration lever. Two feet away\nwas the lever that controlled all the power on the ship. If he could\nonly reach it, he could stop the _Avenger_ dead, and possibly even put\nthe ship completely out of commission. But try as he might, he could not\nget his hands free.\n\nCoxine looked up at the astral chronometer and walked over to the valve.\n\"Well, Corbett,\" demanded the burly spaceman, \"what's the recognition\nsignal?\"\n\nTom only shook his head.\n\n\"Must be pretty bad, sitting down there in the dark, hearing the oxygen\nfeed in slower and slower. You sure you won't change your mind?\"\n\nTom looked squarely at Coxine, hatred in his eyes, and he watched the\npirate captain shrug his shoulders, turn the valve again, and return to\nhis charts.\n\nThe young cadet watched the astral chronometer, seeing the red hand\nsweep the seconds away, and the black minute hand inch around the dial.\nOver and over, the curly-haired Space Cadet refused Coxine's demand for\nthe recognition signal and then watched helplessly as the pirate gave\nthe air-lock valve another twist.\n\nNearly two hours had passed and Tom knew that they would soon be in\nradar range of the Ganymede garrison. The pressure in the air lock must\nnow be within ten units of zero. Suddenly, overhead, the audioceiver\nloud-speaker crackled into life.\n\n\"Attention! This is Ganymede traffic control. Identify yourself\nimmediately with authorized code!\"\n\nCoxine glared at Tom and put his hand on the air-lock valve. \"Last time,\nCorbett. Either you give me the Solar Guard recognition signal, or your\nbuddies are finished!\"\n\nTom gulped. He had no assurance that Coxine would release Roger and\nAstro, even if he did give him the signal. But he knew there was no\nchoice. He looked up at Coxine.\n\n\"Do I have your word as an _Earthman_ that nothing will happen to them?\"\nhe asked quietly.\n\nCoxine laughed. \"Sure. I'll give you my word. I'll even bring them up\nhere so they can see the show and then let you go afterward. But by the\ntime I'm finished with the Ganymede colony the Solar Guard will have\nyour hides for handing out their secrets.\"\n\nTom knew what the pirate said was true. He was taking a gamble now. A\ngamble that by this time his signal on the _Polaris_ had been picked up\nand a fleet of ships would be on their trail.\n\n\"Attention! Attention! Identify yourselves immediately!\" The voice from\nthe Ganymede traffic-control tower came over the audioceiver again.\nCoxine's face twisted into a half-smile.\n\n\"Well, Corbett, do I get the signal or don't I?\"\n\n\"Tell them you're a Solar Guard armed freighter.\" Tom's voice was low.\n\"You're assigned to operation 'Vista.'\"\n\n\"Vista?\" said Coxine excitedly. \"Is that the code word? Vista?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Tom. \"Now open the valve!\"\n\nCoxine gave the valve a number of turns in the opposite direction and\njumped to the teleceiver. He flipped the key open and called Wallace\naboard the _Polaris_. \"When they ask you for identification, tell them\nyou're working on operation Vista. That's the key word. Vista!\"\n\n\"Right!\" answered Wallace.\n\nCoxine then turned to the audioceiver and spoke in confident, assured\ntones. \"Attention, Ganymede traffic control! This is armed freighter\n_Samson_, assigned on project Vista. Request clearance for approach and\ntouchdown on Ganymede spaceport!\"\n\n\"You are properly identified, _Samson_,\" replied Ganymede. \"Proceed on\nyour present course. End transmission.\"\n\n\"End transmission!\" roared Coxine triumphantly.\n\nThe giant pirate turned back to Tom, bellowing, \"Thanks, Corbett. You've\njust given me the key to everything I ever wanted.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Tom, suddenly frightened by the strange wild\ngleam in Coxine's eyes.\n\n\"By the time I've finished with Ganymede, I'll have every ship on their\nspaceport. A fleet big enough to hit any part of the Solar Alliance I\nwant! Solar Guard or no Solar Guard!\"\n\n\"No! You can't!\" gasped Tom.\n\n\"Can't I?\" snarled Coxine. \"I'll show the Solar Guard something they\nnever saw before. Their own ships blasting them right out of space!\"\n\nCoxine turned to the intercom, ordered Astro and Roger brought up to the\ncontrol deck, and then contacted Wallace aboard the _Polaris_.\n\n\"Yeah?\" answered the spaceman from the control deck of the rocket\ncruiser.\n\n\"We're going in according to plan! Train all your guns on the Solar\nGuard defense installations and stand by!\"\n\n\"Ready any time you say the word,\" replied Wallace.\n\nJumping back to the intercom, Coxine gave orders to the power deck for\nfull thrust, then ordered the radar bridge to relay the scanner image of\nGanymede to the control deck.\n\nAs the rocket ship surged ahead under the added thrust, Tom strained\nagainst his ropes to watch the scanner and saw the clear image of the\ncolony. He could make out the outline of the uranium plant, the\natmosphere booster stations and small buildings clustered around the\nspaceport. As they drew closer to the tiny colony, Coxine grabbed the\nintercom and the teleceiver microphones and barked crisp orders to both\nthe Avengers and the _Polaris_' power decks. \"Full braking rockets!\"\nroared Coxine.\n\nTom braced himself against the sudden reverse pressure of the powerful\nnose rockets, and then, in a moment, felt the _Avenger_ come to a dead\nstop. Watching the scanner again, he saw that they were directly over\nthe Solar Guard garrison. Coxine switched the teleceiver to the colony\nfrequency and spoke sharply and confidently.\n\n\"Attention! All citizens of Ganymede colony! This is Bull Coxine. Your\nentire settlement is under my guns. Any attempt to raise ship and oppose\nme will be met with instant destruction! Every citizen is hereby ordered\nto assemble at the municipal spaceport within five minutes. All Solar\nGuard officers and men will do the same. You have five minutes to\ncomply, or I will open fire!\"\n\nThe giant spaceman flipped off the teleceiver before anyone on Ganymede\ncould answer. Pressing with all his might, Tom managed to see more of\nthe scanner which suddenly showed the people of Ganymede scurrying out\nto the spaceport in panic. Coxine watched the activity on the scanner\nfor a second and then grunted his satisfaction.\n\nSuddenly the hatch was thrown open and Astro and Roger were pushed into\nthe room by two crewmen.\n\nCoxine turned to them, smiling thinly. \"You owe your lives to your buddy\nhere. One more minute and you would've been walking with the angels.\nNow,\" he added to the crewmen, \"tie them up so they can see the scanner.\nI want them to see how easy it is to knock off a Solar Guard garrison!\"\n\n\"Why you--\" Astro lunged toward the pirate but was stopped in his tracks\nby a blast from a paralo-ray gun behind him. The big cadet stood rigid,\nmotionless, every nerve and muscle in his body paralyzed. Coxine sneered\nand turned back to the intercom while his men tied up the two cadets.\n\nTom and Roger looked at each other and, without speaking, knew what the\nother was thinking. Their only hope was the beacon signal aboard the\n_Polaris_.\n\nAfter the men had tied Astro, they released him from the effects of the\nray charge and threw him down beside Roger.\n\n\"How do you feel?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"Like I've been run through a set of gears,\" mumbled Astro. \"How about\nyourself?\"\n\n\"O.K.,\" replied Tom. \"Was it\"--he paused--\"was it tough in the air\nlock?\"\n\nRoger smiled. \"Not as tough as it must have been on you up here. We\nrealized what was going on as soon as we found out we were losing air.\"\n\nThe blond-haired cadet shook his head and Tom noticed that both Roger\nand Astro were weak from their ordeal in the chamber.\n\nAt the control panel, Coxine was bawling orders to his crew. \"Jet boats\none, two, three, four, and five! Stand by to blast off!\"\n\nThe three cadets looked at each other helplessly.\n\n\"Russell, check in,\" continued the burly spaceman.\n\n\"Russell here!\" replied a voice on the intercom.\n\n\"You're in charge of the party. I want you to do one thing, and one\nthing only! Take the largest ships on the spaceport and blast off. Don't\ntouch anything else! Just the ships. Those you can't get off the ground,\nleave. We'll blast them later!\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir.\"\n\nCoxine strode over to the teleceiver. Immediately the image of a man in\nthe uniform of a Solar Guard major appeared on the screen. His voice\nechoed in the control room.\n\n\"Hello, Coxine! This is Major Sommers! Come in, Coxine!\"\n\n\"Yeah--\" replied Coxine. \"Whaddya want?\" The pirate captain stepped\narrogantly in front of the teleceiver's transmitting lens, and from the\nlook on the officer's face, Tom knew he had seen Coxine on his own\nscreen.\n\n\"We've followed orders,\" said the major. \"Our only request is that you\ndo not harm any of the citizens--\"\n\nCoxine cut him off. \"Stow that space gas! I'll do what I please! I'm\nsending down a crew of men. They have certain orders. Any interference\nfrom you and I'll open fire with everything I've got--right in the\nmiddle of the spaceport.\"\n\nTom gasped. The spaceport was now crowded with the citizens of the tiny\ncolony.\n\nThe major nodded gravely. \"I understand,\" he said. \"You may rest assured\nno one will interfere with your men!\"\n\n\"Huh!\" sneered Coxine. \"You don't sound so high and mighty now that\nyou're staring into the barrels of a dozen atomic blasters!\" He snapped\noff the teleceiver and roared with laughter.\n\nTom felt a shiver run down his spine. He could imagine the frustration\nof the Ganymede garrison, a crack crew of fighting men, forced to\nsurrender without firing a shot. And he had been the cause by giving\nCoxine the code recognition signal!\n\nCoxine snapped an order into the intercom and a moment later Tom saw the\njet boats on the scanner, rocketing down to the surface of the small\nsatellite.\n\nAs, one by one, the small ships landed on the spaceport, the three\ncadets could see the crowds of colonists fan out, allowing the jet boats\nto come in without interference.\n\nCoxine strode up and down the control deck restlessly, but keeping his\neyes on the activity below. Suddenly he rushed to the scanner, stared\nhard, and then let out a roar of triumph.\n\nThe three cadets saw the reason immediately. On the scanner were the\nunmistakable outlines of two Solar Guard heavy cruisers, four\ndestroyers, and six scouts, hurtling spaceward at tremendous speed.\nCoxine spun around, balled his fists into tight knots, and shook them at\nthe three cadets.\n\n\"I've won! I've won!\" He roared with insane laughter and there was a\ncrazed gleam in his eyes. \"I've got the ships, the guns, the men, and\nthe secret of the adjustable light-key. By the time I'm finished with\nthe Solar Guard there won't be anything left of those crawlers but what\nyou can hear on a story spool, and the Solar Alliance will be run by one\nman!\" He paused, his face grew hard and he tapped his chest menacingly.\n\"Me!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 20\n\n\n\"I don't care if the blasted ship blows up!\" roared Captain Strong to\nthe power-deck officer of the Solar Guard rocket cruiser _Arcturus_. \"I\nwant every ounce of thrust you can get out of this space heap!\"\n\nThe young Solar Guard captain turned back to the loud-speaker of the\naudioceiver, turned the volume dial a fraction, and listened. The steady\npronounced ping of Roger's signal beacon filled his ears.\n\nWhen Strong discovered that Coxine had outwitted him, he had gone aboard\nthe rocket cruiser _Arcturus_ of Squadron Ten and had continued on\nsearch patrol. He dared not break audio silence to warn the cadets\naboard the _Polaris_, lest he give away the position of the ship. Later,\nwhen the radar officer of the _Arcturus_ reported a steady signal over\nthe audioceiver, Strong at first dismissed it as some form of\ninterference from space. But when Titan failed to report the arrival of\nthe _Polaris_ on time, Strong investigated the strange sound. Taking a\nbearing on the signal, he discovered it came from a position dangerously\nclose to the small Jovian colony of Ganymede. After repeated attempts to\nraise the _Polaris_ failed, and no distress signals had been received,\nStrong feared that Bull Coxine had won again. In a desperate effort to\ncatch the criminal, he took repeated bearings on the signal and ordered\nfull emergency space speed toward the small satellite of Jupiter.\n\nContacting Commander Walters at Space Academy, Strong related his\nsuspicions and received permission to carry out a plan of action.\n\n\"I want you to engage the enemy at all costs!\" ordered Walters. \"Blast\nhis space-crawling hide into protons! That's an order!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\" replied Strong with grim determination. \"There's nothing I'd\nlike better.\"\n\nSix hours later Strong received confirmation of his worst fears. He was\nhanded a message that read:\n\n     EMERGENCY:\n\n     GANYMEDE GARRISON ATTACKED ZERO THREE HUNDRED HOURS BY TWO SHIPS.\n     ONE VESSEL IDENTIFIED AS ROCKET CRUISER POLARIS. SEND AID\n     IMMEDIATELY. ENTIRE COLONY AT MERCY OF COXINE. SIGNED, SOMMERS,\n     MAJOR, SOLAR GUARD.\n\nStrong realized at once that the cadets had been forced to give the\nrecognition code to the pirate. There wasn't any other way for the\npirate to penetrate the defenses of Ganymede. And, thought Strong\nbitterly, to blast Coxine was to blast the cadets as well. The\ncommander's words echoed again in his ears, \"... blast him, Steve!\nThat's an order!\"\n\nStrong turned to his second-in-command. \"Man all guns! Stand by to\nattack under plan S! We'll engage the enemy as soon as he's sighted!\"\n\nThe young officer saluted and turned away quickly. But not before he saw\nthe mist in Steve Strong's eyes.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTom, Roger, and Astro watched the incredible scene taking place in front\nof them with unbelieving eyes. Seven men were standing at rigid\nattention on the control deck of the _Avenger_. Wallace, Russell,\nAttardi, Harris, Shelly, Martin, and Brooks. In front of them, standing\nequally rigid, Bull Coxine was addressing them in a low restrained\nvoice.\n\n\"Raise your right hands and repeat after me.\"\n\nThe men raised their hands.\n\n\"I hereby pledge my life to Bull Coxine!\"\n\n\"... I hereby pledge my life to Bull Coxine....\" repeated the men in\nunison.\n\n\"To uphold his decisions, obey his orders, and fulfill his purpose of\ndestroying the Solar Alliance and establishing a new governmental\norder!\"\n\nThe seven men repeated the words slowly and hesitantly.\n\n\"All right,\" said Coxine. \"From this day on, you are my chief\nlieutenants. You will command the ships of my fleet, and when we destroy\nthe power of the Solar Guard and take over the Alliance, you will help\nme rule our new order.\"\n\nThe seven men looked at each other, raised a mild cheer, and waited as\nCoxine shook hands with each of them.\n\n\"All right,\" said Coxine abruptly as he reached the end of the line.\n\"Get to your ships and prepare for full acceleration. We go into action\nimmediately!\"\n\nThe men filed from the room silently, each with a worried look on his\nface. Coxine failed to notice their lack of enthusiasm and turned to the\nthree cadets.\n\n\"Some day, boys,\" he said, \"you'll go down in history as being the first\nwitnesses to the establishment of the new order.\"\n\nAstro glared up at the giant spaceman. \"We'll be the witnesses to the\nbiggest bust in the universe when the Solar Guard catches up with you!\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" drawled Roger in his most casual manner. \"You're the one that'll\ngo down in history, Coxine, as the biggest space-gassing idiot that ever\nblasted off!\"\n\nTom suddenly guffawed. Though close to death, he couldn't help laughing\nat Roger's remark. The big spaceman flushed angrily and with the flat of\nhis hand slapped the cadet across the face. Then, he turned to the\nteleceiver and opened the circuit to all the ships that were standing by\nin space around the _Avenger_, the ships of the Ganymede garrison.\n\n\"Stand by for acceleration,\" he called. \"We're going to show the Solar\nAlliance who's boss, beginning right now! I'll give you the target in a\nfew minutes but head in the direction of Earth!\"\n\nHe faced the three cadets and sneered. \"By the time I'm finished with\nLuna City, the only thing active will be radioactive!\"\n\nSuddenly Gus Wallace could be heard screaming over the teleceiver, his\nface a mask of fear and panic.\n\n\"Bull! Bull!\" he shouted. \"The Solar Guard! We just spotted them!\nSquadrons! Heading straight for us! We've got to get out of here!\"\n\n\"What?\" roared Coxine, turning to his radar scanner. The blips on the\nscreen verified the alarm. He shouted into the teleceiver, \"Man your\nguns! We'll wipe them out right now!\"\n\n\"But, Bull--\" whined Wallace. \"They'll blast us out of space!\"\n\nCoxine roared into the mike. \"The first one of you yellow crawlers that\ntries to run for it will be blasted by me! Man your guns, I said! This\nis our big chance! Wipe out the Solar Guard now and the Solar Alliance\nis ours for the asking! Fight, men! Fight!\"\n\nTom, Roger, and Astro looked at each other, mouths open, not knowing\nwhether they should laugh or not at the dramatic speech of the huge\nspaceman. But whatever the private feelings of the criminals, Coxine had\nroused them to fever pitch and the boys could hear them racing through\nthe _Avenger_, preparing to fight the squadrons of Solar Guard ships\nbearing down on them.\n\nCoxine strapped himself in the pilot's chair and began barking orders to\nhis battle stations, whipping his men into action relentlessly.\n\nAnd then suddenly Captain Strong's voice, vibrant and firm, came over\nthe audioceiver, demanding the surrender of the pirate captain and his\nfleet.\n\n\"Never!\" roared Coxine. \"You'll get my surrender from the barrels of\nevery blaster I have under my command!\"\n\n\"Then,\" replied Strong, \"I have no alternative but to attack!\"\n\nWith a coldness that reached across the void of space and gripped their\nhearts with icy fingers, the three cadets heard their skipper give his\nsquadrons the deadly order!\n\n\"Fire!\"\n\nCoxine snapped his order at almost the same instant and the three cadets\nfelt the _Avenger_ shudder as her turrets began blazing away, returning\nround for round of the deadly atomic missiles.\n\nRacing from scanner to the control panel and back again, Coxine watched\nthe battle rage around him. With speeds nearing that of light, exhaust\ntrails cut scarlet paths through the black space, as the two opposing\nfleets attacked, counterattacked, and then regrouped to attack again.\nThe rhythm of the blasters on the _Avenger_ had taken on a familiar\npattern of five-second intervals between bursts. Gradually, one by one,\nthe pirate ships were hit, demolished or badly damaged, but still they\nfought on. Coxine, his eyes wild with desperation, now kept lining up\nships in his radar sights and firing, with no way of knowing which was\nfriend and which was foe.\n\nTom, Roger, and Astro watched the dogfight on the scanner in horrified\nfascination. Never before had they seen such maneuvering, as the giant\nships avoided collision sometimes by inches. Once, Tom tore his eyes\naway from the scanner when he saw a rocket destroyer plow through the\nescaping swarm of jet boats after one of the pirate ships had been hit.\n\nFire and change course, fire and change course, again and again, Coxine\nperformed the miracle of escaping the deadly atomic blasters aboard the\nSolar Guard ships.\n\nSuddenly the three cadets saw the outline of a rocket cruiser bearing\ndown on them. The white blip on the scanner came closer and closer to\nthe heart of the scanner. Just in time Coxine saw it and shouted for a\ncourse change. But even as the _Avenger_ swung up and away from the\nattacking ship, the cadets saw the flash of flame from the cruiser's\nturrets and a moment later felt the bone-rattling shudder of a near\nmiss.\n\nThe control deck suddenly filled with smoke. A flash fire broke out in\nthe control panel and the circuits sparked and flared. Tom was thrown\nacross the room and Roger landed on top of him.\n\n\"Up ninety degrees! Full starboard thrust!\" roared Coxine into the\nintercom. \"Hurry, you space crawlers! We've got to get out of here!\"\n\nTom quickly realized that in the smoke and confusion Coxine couldn't\npossibly direct the ship back into the fight. There was only one\nexplanation. He was deserting his fleet and trying to escape.\n\nAnd then, over the noise and confusion, Tom could hear the sound of\nstruggling bodies and Coxine muttering an oath between his teeth.\n\n\"I'll break you in two, you blasted space rat!\"\n\nThere were more sounds of struggle, and Tom and Roger heard Astro's\nvoice replying grimly:\n\n\"Do it and then talk about it, big shot!\"\n\nSlowly the smoke cleared from the control deck and Tom and Roger\nstrained their eyes to see through the thick cloud. There, in front of\nthem, stood Astro, torn strands of rope dangling from his arms, in\nmortal combat with Coxine. The two giants were holding each other's\nwrists, their feet spread wide, legs braced, grimacing faces an inch\napart, struggling to throw each other off balance.\n\n[Illustration: _Astro and Coxine were locked in mortal combat_]\n\nTom and Roger watched the two huge spacemen brace against each other,\nmuscles straining and faces turning a slow red as they tried to force\nthe other's hands back. Suddenly, with the speed of a cat, Coxine stuck\nout his leg and kicked Astro's foot from the deck, tripping him. Astro\ntumbled to the deck. In a flash, the pirate was on top of him, gripping\nhim by the throat. The Venusian grabbed at the hands that were slowly\nchoking the life out of him and pulled at the fingers, his face turning\nslowly from the angry flush of a moment before to the dark-gray hue of\nimpending death!\n\nStill bound and tied by the heavy rope, the two cadets on the deck were\nhelpless, as Astro's strength slipped from his body.\n\nTom turned to Roger desperately. \"We've got to do something!\"\n\n\"What? I can't get loose!\" The blond-haired cadet struggled against the\nropes until the blood ran down his wrists, but it was a hopeless effort.\n\n\"Yell!\" said Tom desperately. \"Yell! Make a noise! Holler like you've\nnever hollered before!\"\n\n\"Yell?\" asked Roger stupidly.\n\n\"We've got to distract him!\"\n\nTom began to bellow, and immediately was echoed by Roger. They shouted\nand screamed. They kicked their feet on the deck and tore against their\nbonds.\n\nAstro's hands no longer fought the powerful fingers taking his life.\nThere was no strength in the cadet's hands now, but in the split second\nthat Coxine turned to look at Tom and Roger, he gave a mighty heave with\nthe last of his great strength and tore free of the pirate's grasp.\n\nThe Venusian jumped up and ran to the farthest corner of the control\ndeck, gasping for breath. Coxine rushed after him, but Astro eluded him\nand stumbled to the opposite end of the control room, still trying to\nsuck the life-giving breath into his screaming lungs. Slowly his\nstrength returned.\n\nCoxine made another headlong rush for the cadet, but this time Astro did\nnot attempt to get away. He stood squarely to meet the charge and his\nright fist caught the pirate flush on the chin. Coxine staggered back,\neyes wide with surprise. In an instant Astro was on him, pounding his\nmighty fists into the pirate's stomach and any place he could find an\nopening. Roaring like a wild animal, the cadet no longer fought for the\nhonor of the Solar Guard or his friends. He didn't look upon the\ncriminal in front of him as Coxine the pirate, but as a man who had\nnearly taken his life, and he fought with the ferocity of a man who\nwanted to live.\n\nAgain and again, Tom and Roger saw their unit-mate pound straight,\npowerful, jolting lefts and rights into the pirate's mid-section until\nthey thought he would put his fist completely through the man's body.\n\nJust as Coxine looked as if he would fall, he suddenly charged in again.\nBut his powerful strength restored, Astro stepped back and waited for an\nopening. Coxine threw a whistling right for Astro's head. The Venusian\nducked, shifting his weight slightly, and drove his right squarely into\nthe pirate's face. His eyes suddenly glassy and vacant, Bull Coxine sank\nto the deck, out cold.\n\nBreathing heavily, the cadet turned, wiped his face, and smiled\ncrookedly at Tom and Roger.\n\n\"If I ever have to fight another man like that again,\" gasped Astro as\nhe loosened the ropes around his unit-mates, \"I want to have both fists\ndipped in lead before I begin!\"\n\nHe held up his hands. There was not a bit of flesh remaining on his\nknuckles.\n\nAs soon as Tom was free he grabbed the pirate's paralo-ray gun. \"We'd\nbetter tie this crawler up!\" he shouted.\n\n\"We'll do that,\" said Roger. \"You try to figure out how we're going to\nget off this ship!\"\n\nSuddenly, behind them, the hatch burst open and Captain Strong rushed\ninto the room, followed by a dozen armed guardsmen.\n\n\"Captain Strong!\" yelled the three cadets together.\n\nThe young captain's face lighted up with a smile. He rushed over to Tom\nand grabbed him by the hand, then turned to where Roger and Astro were\ntying up Coxine.\n\nStrong pointed his gun at the fallen pirate. \"What happened to him?\"\n\nRoger smiled and nodded toward Astro. \"Coxine told Astro he reminded him\nof an ox he saw at a zoo once on Venus. Astro got mad--\" Roger shrugged\nhis shoulders. \"Poor Coxine, he didn't have a chance!\"\n\nAstro blushed and looked up at Strong. \"Never mind us, sir,\" said the\nbig cadet. \"How did you get here!\"\n\nStrong told them of having picked up the beacon signal. \"That was quick\nthinking, boys,\" he said. \"It was the end of Coxine. If we hadn't\nstopped him now--\" Strong shook his head.\n\n\"But how did you get aboard the _Avenger_, sir?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"This was the only ship that wasn't a Solar Guard fleet vessel, so it\nwas easy to spot. We captured the _Polaris_ right off the bat, and after\nwe searched it, figured you three were either dead, or aboard this one.\nI gave the order not to fire on you, since we wiped out Coxine's fleet\nbefore he could do any real damage. When we saw you accelerating, after\nthat last near miss--which incidentally was intended to miss you--we\ncame alongside, forced the air lock open, and took over.\"\n\n\"But didn't the crew offer any resistance?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"No, and from the story they tell me about Coxine wanting to establish a\nnew order, or something like that, they were glad to surrender. They\nthink he's crazy.\"\n\nWhen the enlisted men carried Coxine, still unconscious, off the control\ndeck, the three members of the _Polaris_ unit and their skipper watched\nhim leave silently. All of them realized how close the Solar Alliance\nhad come to destruction at the hands of the insane pirate. Finally\nStrong turned to his crew of cadets.\n\n\"Well, boys,\" he said wearily, \"we've recovered the adjustable light-key\nand captured Coxine. I guess that finishes the space pirates!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Tom quietly. \"And this sure teaches me a lesson.\"\n\n\"What's that?\" said Strong.\n\n\"Never to think that being a Space Cadet is a matter of learning\nsomething from a story spool. Being a Space Cadet is like being--\" He\nstopped. \"Like nothing in the universe!\"\n\n\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nTHE TOM CORBETT SPACE CADET STORIES\n\nBy Carey Rockwell\n\n    STAND BY FOR MARS!\n    DANGER IN DEEP SPACE\n    ON THE TRAIL OF THE SPACE PIRATES\n    THE SPACE PIONEERS\n    THE REVOLT ON VENUS\n    TREACHERY IN OUTER SPACE\n    SABOTAGE IN SPACE\n    THE ROBOT ROCKET\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of On the Trail of the Space Pirates, by\nCarey Rockwell\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ON THE TRAIL OF THE SPACE PIRATES ***\n\n***** This file should be named 21092-8.txt or 21092-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/1/0/9/21092/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
