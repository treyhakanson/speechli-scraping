Shea, of Rutgers University, makes an interesting\n    contribution to robotics with this story of Rankin, who prided\n    himself on knowing how to handle robots, but did not realize that\n    the robots of the Clearchan Confederacy were subject to a higher law\n    than implicit obedience to man._\n\n\n     the\n helpful\n  robots\n\n _by ROBERT J. SHEA_\n\n\n They had come to pass judgement on him. He had violated\n their law--wilfully, ignorantly, and very deliberately.\n\n\n\"Our people will be arriving to visit us today,\" the robot said.\n\n\"Shut up!\" snapped Rod Rankin. He jumped, wiry and quick, out of the\nchair on his verandah and stared at a cloud of dust in the distance.\n\n\"Our people--\" the ten-foot, cylinder-bodied robot grated, when Rod\nRankin interrupted him.\n\n\"I don't care about your fool people,\" said Rankin. He squinted at the\ncloud of dust getting bigger and closer beyond the wall of _kesh_ trees\nthat surrounded the rolling acres of his plantation. \"That damned new\nneighbor of mine is coming over here again.\"\n\nHe gestured widely, taking in the dozens of robots with their shiny,\ncylindrical bodies and pipestem arms and legs laboring in his fields.\n\"Get all your people together and go hide in the wood, fast.\"\n\n\"It is not right,\" said the robot. \"We were made to serve all.\"\n\n\"Well, there are only a hundred of you, and I'm not sharing you with\nanybody,\" said Rankin.\n\n\"It is not right,\" the robot repeated.\n\n\"Don't talk to me about what's right,\" said Rankin. \"You're built to\nfollow orders, nothing else. I know a thing or two about how you robots\nwork. You've got one law, to follow orders, and until that neighbor of\nmine sees you to give you orders, you work for me. Now get into those\nwoods and hide till he goes away.\"\n\n\"We will go to greet those who visit us today,\" said the robot.\n\n\"Alright, alright, scram,\" said Rankin.\n\nThe robots in the fields and the one whom Rankin had been talking to\nformed a column and marched off into the trackless forests behind his\nplantation.\n\nA battered old ground-car drove up a few minutes later. A tall,\nbroad-shouldered man with a deep tan got out and walked up the path to\nRankin's verandah.\n\n\"Hi, Barrows,\" said Rankin.\n\n\"Hello,\" said Barrows. \"See your crop's coming along pretty well. Can't\nfigure how you do it. You've got acres and acres to tend, far's I can\nsee, and I'm having a hell of a time with one little piece of ground. I\nswear you must know something about this planet that I don't know.\"\n\n\"Just scientific farming,\" said Rankin carelessly. \"Look, you come over\nhere for something, or just to gab? I got a lot of work to do.\"\n\nBarrows looked weary and worried. \"Them brown beetles is at my crop\nagain,\" he said. \"Thought you might know some way of getting rid of\nthem.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said Rankin. \"Pick them off, one by one. That's how I get rid of\nthem.\"\n\n\"Why, man,\" said Barrows, \"you can't walk all over these miles and miles\nof farm and pick off every one of them beetles. You must know another\nway.\"\n\nRankin drew himself up and stared at Barrows. \"I'm telling you all I\nfeel like telling you. You going to stand here and jaw all day? Seems to\nme like you got work to do.\"\n\n\"Rankin,\" said Barrows, \"I know you were a crook back in the Terran\nEmpire, and that you came out beyond the border to escape the law. Seems\nto me, though, that even a crook, any man, would be willing to help his\nonly neighbor out on a lone planet like this. You might need help\nyourself, sometime.\"\n\n\"You keep your thoughts about my past to yourself,\" said Rankin.\n\"Remember, I keep a gun. And you've got a wife and a whole bunch of kids\non that farm of yours. Be smart and let me alone.\"\n\n\"I'm going,\" said Barrows. He walked off the verandah and turned and\nspat carefully into the dusty path. He climbed into his ground-car and\ndrove off.\n\nRankin, angry, watched him go. Then he heard a humming noise from\nanother direction.\n\nHe turned. A huge, white globe was descending across the sky. A space\nship, thought Rankin, startled.\n\nPolice? This planet was outside the jurisdiction of the Terran Empire.\nWhen he'd cracked that safe and made off with a hundred thousand\ncredits, he'd headed here, because the planet was part of something\ncalled the Clearchan Confederacy. No extradition treaties or anything.\nPerfectly safe, if the planet was safe.\n\nAnd the planet was more than safe. There had been a hundred robots\nwaiting when he landed. Where they came from he didn't know, but Rankin\nprided himself on knowing how to handle robots. He'd appropriated their\nservices and started his farm. At the rate he was going, he'd be a\nplantation owner before long.\n\nThat must be where the ship was from. The robot said they'd expected\nvisitors. Must be the Clearchan Confederacy visiting this robot outpost.\nWas that good or bad?\n\nFrom everything he'd read, and from what the robots had told him, they\nwere probably more robots. That was good, because he knew how to handle\nrobots.\n\nThe white globe disappeared into the jungle of _kesh_ trees. Rankin\nwaited.\n\nA half hour later the column of his robot laborers marched out of the\nforest. There were three more robots, painted grey, at the head. The new\nones from the ship, thought Rankin. Well, he'd better establish who was\nboss right from the start.\n\n\"Stop right there!\" he shouted.\n\nThe shiny robot laborers halted. But the three grey ones came on.\n\n\"Stop!\" shouted Rankin.\n\nThey didn't stop, and by the time they reached the verandah, he cursed\nhimself for having failed to get his gun.\n\nTwo of the huge grey robots laid gentle hands on his arms. Gentle hands,\nbut hands of superstrong metal.\n\nThe third said, \"We have come to pass judgement on you. You have\nviolated our law.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" said Rankin. \"The only law robots have is to obey\norders.\"\n\n\"It is true that the robots of your Terran Empire and these simple\nworkers here must obey orders. But they are subject to a higher law, and\nyou have forced them to break it. That is your crime.\"\n\n\"What crime?\" said Rankin.\n\n\"We of the Clearchan Confederacy are a race of robots. Our makers\nimplanted one law in us, and then passed on. We have carried our law to\nall the planets we have colonized. In obeying your orders, these workers\nwere simply following that one law. You must be taken to our capital,\nand there be imprisoned and treated for your crime.\"\n\n\"What law? What crime?\"\n\n\"Our law,\" said the giant robot, \"is, _Help thy neighbor_.\"\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ September 1957.\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
