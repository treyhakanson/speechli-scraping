He tried,\n    but the things that happened after he'd pulled the trigger were all\n    wrong. Like everyone standing around like statues. No St. Peter, no\n    pearly gate, no pitchforks or halos. He might just as well have\n    saved the bullet!_\n\n\nDave Miller would never have done it, had he been in his right mind. The\nMillers were not a melancholy stock, hardly the sort of people you\nexpect to read about in the morning paper who have taken their lives the\nnight before. But Dave Miller was drunk--abominably, roaringly so--and\nthe barrel of the big revolver, as he stood against the sink, made a\nring of coldness against his right temple.\n\nDawn was beginning to stain the frosty kitchen windows. In the faint\nlight, the letter lay a gray square against the drain-board tiles. With\nthe melodramatic gesture of the very drunk, Miller had scrawled across\nthe envelope:\n\n\"This is why I did it!\"\n\n[Illustration: Dave Miller pushed with all his strength, but the girl\nwas as unmovable as Gibraltar.]\n\nHe had found Helen's letter in the envelope when he staggered into their\nbedroom fifteen minutes ago--at a quarter after five. As had frequently\nhappened during the past year, he'd come home from the store a little\nlate ... about twelve hours late, in fact. And this time Helen had done\nwhat she had long threatened to do. She had left him.\n\nThe letter was brief, containing a world of heartbreak and broken hopes.\n\n\"I don't mind having to scrimp, Dave. No woman minds that if she feels\nshe is really helping her husband over a rough spot. When business went\nbad a year ago, I told you I was ready to help in any way I could. But\nyou haven't let me. You quit fighting when things got difficult, and put\nin all your money and energy on liquor and horses and cards. I could\nstand being married to a drunkard, Dave, but not to a coward ...\"\n\nSo she was trying to show him. But Miller told himself he'd show her\ninstead. Coward, eh? Maybe this would teach her a lesson! Hell of a lot\nof help she'd been! Nag at him every time he took a drink. Holler bloody\nmurder when he put twenty-five bucks on a horse, with a chance to make\nfive hundred. What man wouldn't do those things?\n\nHis drug store was on the skids. Could he be blamed for drinking a\nlittle too much, if alcohol dissolved the morbid vapors of his mind?\n\nMiller stiffened angrily, and tightened his finger on the trigger. But\nhe had one moment of frank insight just before the hammer dropped and\nbrought the world tumbling about his ears. It brought with it a\nrealization that the whole thing was his fault. Helen was right--he was\na coward. There was a poignant ache in his heart. She'd been as loyal as\nthey came, he knew that.\n\nHe could have spent his nights thinking up new business tricks, instead\nof swilling whiskey. Could have gone out of his way to be pleasant to\ncustomers, not snap at them when he had a terrific hangover. And even\nMiller knew nobody ever made any money on the horses--at least, not when\nhe needed it. But horses and whiskey and business had become tragically\nconfused in his mind; so here he was, full of liquor and madness, with a\ngun to his head.\n\nThen again anger swept his mind clean of reason, and he threw his chin\nup and gripped the gun tight.\n\n\"Run out on me, will she!\" he muttered thickly. \"Well--this'll show\nher!\"\n\nIn the next moment the hammer fell ... and Dave Miller had \"shown her.\"\n\nMiller opened his eyes with a start. As plain as black on white, he'd\nheard a bell ring--the most familiar sound in the world, too. It was the\nunmistakable tinkle of his cash register.\n\n\"Now, how in hell--\" The thought began in his mind; and then he saw\nwhere he was.\n\nThe cash register was right in front of him! It was open, and on the\nmarble slab lay a customer's five-spot. Miller's glance strayed up and\naround him.\n\nHe was behind the drug counter, all right. There were a man and a girl\nsipping cokes at the fountain, to his right; the magazine racks by the\nopen door; the tobacco counter across from the fountain. And right\nbefore him was a customer.\n\nGood Lord! he thought. Was all this a--a dream?\n\nSweat oozed out on his clammy forehead. That stuff of Herman's that he\nhad drunk during the game--it had had a rank taste, but he wouldn't have\nthought anything short of marihuana could produce such hallucinations as\nhe had just had. Wild conjectures came boiling up from the bottom of\nMiller's being.\n\nHow did he get behind the counter? Who was the woman he was waiting on?\nWhat--\n\nThe woman's curious stare was what jarred him completely into the\npresent. Get rid of her! was his one thought. Then sit down behind the\nscenes and try to figure it all out.\n\nHis hand poised over the cash drawer. Then he remembered he didn't know\nhow much he was to take out of the five. Avoiding the woman's glance, he\nmuttered:\n\n\"Let's see, now, that was--uh--how much did I say?\"\n\nThe woman made no answer. Miller cleared his throat, said uncertainly:\n\n\"I beg your pardon, ma'am--did I say--seventy-five cents?\"\n\nIt was just a feeler, but the woman didn't even answer to that. And it\nwas right then that Dave Miller noticed the deep silence that brooded in\nthe store.\n\nSlowly his head came up and he looked straight into the woman's eyes.\nShe returned him a cool, half-smiling glance. But her eyes neither\nblinked nor moved. Her features were frozen. Lips parted, teeth showing\na little, the tip of her tongue was between her even white teeth as\nthough she had started to say \"this\" and stopped with the syllable\nunspoken.\n\nMuscles began to rise behind Miller's ears. He could feel his hair\nstiffen like filings drawn to a magnet. His glance struggled to the soda\nfountain. What he saw there shook him to the core of his being.\n\nThe girl who was drinking a coke had the glass to her lips, but\napparently she wasn't sipping the liquid. Her boy friend's glass was on\nthe counter. He had drawn on a cigarette and exhaled the gray smoke.\nThat smoke hung in the air like a large, elongated balloon with the\nsmall end disappearing between his lips. While Miller stared, the smoke\ndid not stir in the slightest.\n\nThere was something unholy, something supernatural, about this scene!\n\nWith apprehension rippling down his spine, Dave Miller reached across\nthe cash register and touched the woman on the cheek. The flesh was\nwarm, but as hard as flint. Tentatively, the young druggist pushed\nharder; finally, shoved with all his might. For all the result, the\nwoman might have been a two-ton bronze statue. She neither budged nor\nchanged expression.\n\nPanic seized Miller. His voice hit a high hysterical tenor as he called\nto his soda-jerker.\n\n\"Pete! _Pete!_\" he shouted. \"What in God's name is wrong here!\"\n\nThe blond youngster, with a towel wadded in a glass, did not stir.\nMiller rushed from the back of the store, seized the boy by the\nshoulders, tried to shake him. But Pete was rooted to the spot.\n\nMiller knew, now, that what was wrong was something greater than a\nhallucination or a hangover. He was in some kind of trap. His first\nthought was to rush home and see if Helen was there. There was a great\nsense of relief when he thought of her. Helen, with her grave blue eyes\nand understanding manner, would listen to him and know what was the\nmatter.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe left the haunted drug store at a run, darted around the corner and up\nthe street to his car. But, though he had not locked the car, the door\nresisted his twisting grasp. Shaking, pounding, swearing, Miller\nwrestled with each of the doors.\n\nAbruptly he stiffened, as a horrible thought leaped into his being. His\ngaze left the car and wandered up the street. Past the intersection,\npast the one beyond that, on up the thoroughfare until the gray haze of\nthe city dimmed everything. And as far as Dave Miller could see, there\nwas no trace of motion.\n\nCars were poised in the street, some passing other machines, some\nturning corners. A street car stood at a safety zone; a man who had\nleaped from the bottom step hung in space a foot above the pavement.\nPedestrians paused with one foot up. A bird hovered above a telephone\npole, its wings glued to the blue vault of the sky.\n\nWith a choked sound, Miller began to run. He did not slacken his pace\nfor fifteen minutes, until around him were the familiar, reassuring\ntrees and shrub-bordered houses of his own street. But yet how strange\nto him!\n\nThe season was autumn, and the air filled with brown and golden leaves\nthat tossed on a frozen wind. Miller ran by two boys lying on a lawn,\npetrified into a modern counterpart of the sculptor's \"The Wrestlers.\"\nThe sweetish tang of burning leaves brought a thrill of terror to him;\nfor, looking down an alley from whence the smoke drifted, he saw a man\ntending a fire whose leaping flames were red tongues that did not move.\n\nSobbing with relief, the young druggist darted up his own walk. He tried\nthe front door, found it locked, and jammed a thumb against the\ndoorbell. But of course the little metal button was as immovable as a\nmountain. So in the end, after convincing himself that the key could not\nbe inserted into the lock, he sprang toward the back.\n\nThe screen door was not latched, but it might as well have been the\nsteel door of a bank vault. Miller began to pound on it, shouting:\n\n\"Helen! Helen, are you in there? My God, dear, there's something wrong!\nYou've got to--\"\n\nThe silence that flowed in again when his voice choked off was the dead\nstillness of the tomb. He could hear his voice rustling through the\nempty rooms, and at last it came back to him like a taunt: \"_Helen!\nHelen!_\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n_Time Stands Still_\n\n\nFor Dave Miller, the world was now a planet of death on which he alone\nlived and moved and spoke. Staggered, utterly beaten, he made no attempt\nto break into his home. But he did stumble around to the kitchen window\nand try to peer in, anxious to see if there was a body on the floor. The\nroom was in semi-darkness, however, and his straining eyes made out\nnothing.\n\nHe returned to the front of the house, shambling like a somnambulist.\nSeated on the porch steps, head in hands, he slipped into a hell of\nregrets. He knew now that his suicide had been no hallucination. He was\ndead, all right; and this must be hell or purgatory.\n\nBitterly he cursed his drinking, that had led him to such a mad thing as\nsuicide. Suicide! He--Dave Miller--a coward who had taken his own life!\nMiller's whole being crawled with revulsion. If he just had the last\nyear to live over again, he thought fervently.\n\nAnd yet, through it all, some inner strain kept trying to tell him he\nwas not dead. This was his own world, all right, and essentially\nunchanged. What had happened to it was beyond the pale of mere\nguesswork. But this one thing began to be clear: This was a world in\nwhich change or motion of any kind was a foreigner.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFire would not burn and smoke did not rise. Doors would not open,\nliquids were solid. Miller's stubbing toe could not move a pebble, and a\nblade of grass easily supported his weight without bending. In other\nwords, Miller began to understand, change had been stopped as surely as\nif a master hand had put a finger on the world's balance wheel.\n\nMiller's ramblings were terminated by the consciousness that he had an\nacute headache. His mouth tasted, as Herman used to say after a big\nnight, as if an army had camped in it. Coffee and a bromo were what he\nneeded.\n\nBut it was a great awakening to him when he found a restaurant and\nlearned that he could neither drink the coffee nor get the lid off the\nbromo bottle. Fragrant coffee-steam hung over the glass percolator, but\neven this steam was as a brick wall to his probing touch. Miller started\ngloomily to thread his way through the waiters in back of the counter\nagain.\n\nMoments later he stood in the street and there were tears swimming in\nhis eyes.\n\n\"Helen!\" His voice was a pleading whisper. \"Helen, honey, where are\nyou?\"\n\nThere was no answer but the pitiful palpitation of utter silence. And\nthen, there was movement at Dave Miller's right!\n\nSomething shot from between the parked cars and crashed against him;\nsomething brown and hairy and soft. It knocked him down. Before he could\nget his breath, a red, wet tongue was licking his face and hands, and he\nwas looking up into the face of a police dog!\n\nFrantic with joy at seeing another in this city of death, the dog would\nscarcely let Miller rise. It stood up to plant big paws on his shoulders\nand try to lick his face. Miller laughed out loud, a laugh with a\nthroaty catch in it.\n\n\"Where'd you come from, boy?\" he asked. \"Won't they talk to you, either?\nWhat's your name, boy?\"\n\nThere was a heavy, brass-studded collar about the animal's neck, and\nDave Miller read on its little nameplate: \"Major.\"\n\n\"Well, Major, at least we've got company now,\" was Miller's sigh of\nrelief.\n\nFor a long time he was too busy with the dog to bother about the sobbing\nnoises. Apparently the dog failed to hear them, for he gave no sign.\nMiller scratched him behind the ear.\n\n\"What shall we do now, Major? Walk? Maybe your nose can smell out\nanother friend for us.\"\n\nThey had gone hardly two blocks when it came to him that there was a\nmore useful way of spending their time. The library! Half convinced that\nthe whole trouble stemmed from his suicide shot in the head--which was\nconspicuously absent now--he decided that a perusal of the surgery books\nin the public library might yield something he could use.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat way they bent their steps, and were soon mounting the broad cement\nstairs of the building. As they went beneath the brass turnstile, the\nlibrarian caught Miller's attention with a smiling glance. He smiled\nback.\n\n\"I'm trying to find something on brain surgery,\" he explained. \"I--\"\n\nWith a shock, then, he realized he had been talking to himself.\n\nIn the next instant, Dave Miller whirled. A voice from the bookcases\nchuckled:\n\n\"If you find anything, I wish you'd let me know. I'm stumped myself!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFrom a corner of the room came an elderly, half-bald man with tangled\ngray brows and a rueful smile. A pencil was balanced over his ear, and a\nnote-book was clutched in his hand.\n\n\"You, too!\" he said. \"I had hoped I was the only one--\"\n\nMiller went forward hurriedly to grip his hand.\n\n\"I'm afraid I'm not so unselfish,\" he admitted. \"I've been hoping for\ntwo hours that I'd run into some other poor soul.\"\n\n\"Quite understandable,\" the stranger murmured sympathetically. \"But in\nmy case it is different. You see--I am responsible for this whole tragic\nbusiness!\"\n\n\"You!\" Dave Miller gulped the word. \"I--I thought--\"\n\nThe man wagged his head, staring at his note pad, which was littered\nwith jumbled calculations. Miller had a chance to study him. He was\ntall, heavily built, with wide, sturdy shoulders despite his sixty\nyears. Oddly, he wore a gray-green smock. His eyes, narrowed and intent,\nlooked gimlet-sharp beneath those toothbrush brows of his, as he stared\nat the pad.\n\n\"There's the trouble, right there,\" he muttered. \"I provided only three\nstages of amplification, whereas four would have been barely enough. No\nwonder the phase didn't carry through!\"\n\n\"I guess I don't follow you,\" Miller faltered. \"You mean--something you\ndid--\"\n\n\"I should think it was something I did!\" The baldish stranger scratched\nhis head with the tip of his pencil. \"I'm John Erickson--you know, the\nWanamaker Institute.\"\n\nMiller said: \"Oh!\" in an understanding voice. Erickson was head of\nWanamaker Institute, first laboratory of them all when it came to\nexploding atoms and blazing trails into the wildernesses of science.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nErickson's piercing eyes were suddenly boring into the younger man.\n\n\"You've been sick, haven't you?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Well--no--not really sick.\" The druggist colored. \"I'll have to admit\nto being drunk a few hours ago, though.\"\n\n\"Drunk--\" Erickson stuck his tongue in his cheek, shook his head,\nscowled. \"No, that would hardly do it. There must have been something\nelse. The impulsor isn't _that_ powerful. I can understand about the\ndog, poor fellow. He must have been run over, and I caught him just at\nthe instant of passing from life to death.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" Dave Miller lifted his head, knowing now what Erickson was driving\nat. \"Well, I may as well be frank. I'm--I committed suicide. That's how\ndrunk I was. There hasn't been a suicide in the Miller family in\ncenturies. It took a skinful of liquor to set the precedent.\"\n\nErickson nodded wisely. \"Perhaps we will find the precedent hasn't\nreally been set! But no matter--\" His lifted hand stopped Miller's\neager, wondering exclamation. \"The point is, young man, we three are in\na tough spot, and it's up to us to get out of it. And not only we, but\nheaven knows how many others the world over!\"\n\n\"Would you--maybe you can explain to my lay mind what's happened,\"\nMiller suggested.\n\n\"Of course. Forgive me. You see, Mr.--\"\n\n\"Miller. Dave Miller.\"\n\n\"Dave it is. I have a feeling we're going to be pretty well acquainted\nbefore this is over. You see, Dave, I'm a nut on so-called 'time\ntheories.' I've seen time compared to everything from an entity to a\nlong, pink worm. But I disagree with them all, because they postulate\nthe idea that time is constantly being manufactured. Such reasoning is\nfantastic!\n\n\"Time exists. Not as an ever-growing chain of links, because such a\nchain would have to have a tail end, if it has a front end; and who can\nimagine the period when time did not exist? So I think time is like a\ncircular train-track. Unending. We who live and die merely travel around\non it. The future exists simultaneously with the past, for one instant\nwhen they meet.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMiller's brain was humming. Erickson shot the words at him\nstaccato-fashion, as if they were things known from Great Primer days.\nThe young druggist scratched his head.\n\n\"You've got me licked,\" he admitted. \"I'm a stranger here, myself.\"\n\n\"Naturally you can't be expected to understand things I've been all my\nlife puzzling about. Simplest way I can explain it is that we are on a\ntrain following this immense circular railway.\n\n\"When the train reaches the point where it started, it is about to\nplunge into the past; but this is impossible, because the point where it\nstarted is simply the caboose of the train! And that point is always\nahead--and behind--the time-train.\n\n\"Now, my idea was that with the proper stimulus a man could be thrust\nacross the diameter of this circular railway to a point in his past.\nBecause of the nature of time, he could neither go ahead of the train to\nmeet the future nor could he stand still and let the caboose catch up\nwith him. But--he could detour across the circle and land farther back\non the train! And that, my dear Dave, is what you and I and Major have\ndone--almost.\"\n\n\"Almost?\" Miller said hoarsely.\n\nErickson pursed his lips. \"We are somewhere partway across the space\nbetween present and past. We are living in an instant that can move\nneither forward nor back. You and I, Dave, and Major--and the Lord knows\nhow many others the world over--have been thrust by my time impulsor\nonto a timeless beach of eternity. We have been caught in time's\nbackwash. Castaways, you might say.\"\n\nAn objection clamored for attention in Miller's mind.\n\n\"But if this is so, where are the rest of them? Where is my wife?\"\n\n\"They are right here,\" Erickson explained. \"No doubt you could see your\nwife if you could find her. But we see them as statues, because, for us,\ntime no longer exists. But there was something I did not count on. I did\nnot know that it would be possible to live in one small instant of time,\nas we are doing. And I did not know that only those who are hovering\nbetween life and death can deviate from the normal process of time!\"\n\n\"You mean--we're dead!\" Miller's voice was a bitter monotone.\n\n\"Obviously not. We're talking and moving, aren't we? But--we are on the\nfence. When I gave my impulsor the jolt of high power, it went wrong and\nI think something must have happened to me. At the same instant, you had\nshot yourself.\n\n\"Perhaps, Dave, you are dying. The only way for us to find out is to try\nto get the machine working and topple ourselves one way or the other. If\nwe fall back, we will all live. If we fall into the present--we may\ndie.\"\n\n\"Either way, it's better than this!\" Miller said fervently.\n\n\"I came to the library here, hoping to find out the things I must know.\nMy own books are locked in my study. And these--they might be cemented\nin their places, for all their use to me. I suppose we might as well go\nback to the lab.\"\n\nMiller nodded, murmuring: \"Maybe you'll get an idea when you look at the\nmachine again.\"\n\n\"Let's hope so,\" said Erickson grimly. \"God knows I've failed so far!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n_Splendid Sacrifice_\n\n\nIt was a solid hour's walk out to West Wilshire, where the laboratory\nwas. The immense bronze and glass doors of Wanamaker Institute were\nclosed, and so barred to the two men. But Erickson led the way down the\nside.\n\n\"We can get in a service door. Then we climb through transoms and\nventilators until we get to my lab.\"\n\nMajor frisked along beside them. He was enjoying the action and the\ncompanionship. It was less of an adventure to Miller, who knew death\nmight be ahead for the three of them.\n\nTwo workmen were moving a heavy cabinet in the side service door. To get\nin, they climbed up the back of the rear workman, walked across the\ncabinet, and scaled down the front of the leading man. They went up the\nstairs to the fifteenth floor. Here they crawled through a transom into\nthe wing marked:\n\n\"Experimental. Enter Only By Appointment.\"\n\nMajor was helped through it, then they were crawling along the dark\nmetal tunnel of an air-conditioning ventilator. It was small, and took\nsome wriggling.\n\nIn the next room, they were confronted by a stern receptionist on whose\ndesk was a little brass sign, reading:\n\n\"Have you an appointment?\"\n\nMiller had had his share of experience with receptionists' ways, in his\ndays as a pharmaceutical salesman. He took the greatest pleasure now in\nlighting his cigarette from a match struck on the girl's nose. Then he\nblew the smoke in her face and hastened to crawl through the final\ntransom.\n\nJohn Erickson's laboratory was well lighted by a glass-brick wall and a\nhuge skylight. The sun's rays glinted on the time impulsor.[1] The\nscientist explained the impulsor in concise terms. When he had finished,\nDave Miller knew just as little as before, and the outfit still\nresembled three transformers in a line, of the type seen on power-poles,\nconnected to a great bronze globe hanging from the ceiling.\n\n\"There's the monster that put us in this plight,\" Erickson grunted. \"Too\nstrong to be legal, too weak to do the job right. Take a good look!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith his hands jammed in his pockets, he frowned at the complex\nmachinery. Miller stared a few moments; then transferred his interests\nto other things in the room. He was immediately struck by the\nresemblance of a transformer in a far corner to the ones linked up with\nthe impulsor.\n\n\"What's that?\" he asked quickly. \"Looks the same as the ones you used\nover there.\"\n\n\"It is.\"\n\n\"But-- Didn't you say all you needed was another stage of power?\"\n\n\"That's right.\"\n\n\"Maybe I'm crazy!\" Miller stared from impulsor to transformer and back\nagain. \"Why don't you use it, then?\"\n\n\"Using what for the connection?\" Erickson's eyes gently mocked him.\n\n\"Wire, of course!\"\n\nThe scientist jerked a thumb at a small bale of heavy copper wire.\n\n\"Bring it over and we'll try it.\"\n\nMiller was halfway to it when he brought up short. Then a sheepish grin\nspread over his features.\n\n\"I get it,\" he chuckled. \"That bale of wire might be the Empire State\nBuilding, as far as we're concerned. Forgive my stupidity.\"\n\nErickson suddenly became serious.\n\n\"I'd like to be optimistic, Dave,\" he muttered, \"but in all fairness to\nyou I must tell you I see no way out of this. The machine is, of course,\nstill working, and with that extra stage of power, the uncertainty would\nbe over. But where, in this world of immovable things, will we find a\npiece of wire twenty-five feet long?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a warm, moist sensation against Miller's hand, and when he\nlooked down Major stared up at him commiseratingly. Miller scratched him\nbehind the ear, and the dog closed his eyes, reassured and happy. The\nyoung druggist sighed, wishing there were some giant hand to scratch him\nbehind the ear and smooth _his_ troubles over.\n\n\"And if we don't get out,\" he said soberly, \"we'll starve, I suppose.\"\n\n\"No, I don't think it will be that quick. I haven't felt any hunger. I\ndon't expect to. After all, our bodies are still living in one instant\nof time, and a man can't work up a healthy appetite in one second. Of\ncourse, this elastic-second business precludes the possibility of\ndisease.\n\n\"Our bodies must go on unchanged. The only hope I see is--when we are on\nthe verge of madness, suicide. That means jumping off a bridge, I\nsuppose. Poison, guns, knives--all the usual wherewithal--are denied to\nus.\"\n\nBlack despair closed down on Dave Miller. He thrust it back, forcing a\ncrooked grin.\n\n\"Let's make a bargain,\" he offered. \"When we finish fooling around with\nthis apparatus, we split up. We'll only be at each other's throat if we\nstick together. I'll be blaming you for my plight, and I don't want to.\nIt's my fault as much as yours. How about it?\"\n\nJohn Erickson gripped his hand. \"You're all right, Dave. Let me give you\nsome advice. If ever you do get back to the present ... keep away from\nliquor. Liquor and the Irish never did mix. You'll have that store on\nits feet again in no time.\"\n\n\"Thanks!\" Miller said fervently. \"And I think I can promise that nothing\nless than a whiskey antidote for snake bite will ever make me bend an\nelbow again!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor the next couple of hours, despondency reigned in the laboratory. But\nit was soon to be deposed again by hope.\n\nDespite all of Erickson's scientific training, it was Dave Miller\nhimself who grasped the down-to-earth idea that started them hoping\nagain. He was walking about the lab, jingling keys in his pocket, when\nsuddenly he stopped short. He jerked the ring of keys into his hand.\n\n\"Erickson!\" he gasped. \"We've been blind. Look at this!\"\n\nThe scientist looked; but he remained puzzled.\n\n\"Well--?\" he asked skeptically.\n\n\"There's our wire!\" Dave Miller exclaimed. \"You've got keys; I've got\nkeys. We've got coins, knives, wristwatches. Why can't we lay them all\nend to end--\"\n\nErickson's features looked as if he had been electrically shocked.\n\n\"You've hit it!\" he cried. \"If we've got enough!\"\n\nWith one accord, they began emptying their pockets, tearing off\nwristwatches, searching for pencils. The finds made a little heap in the\nmiddle of the floor. Erickson let his long fingers claw through thinning\nhair.\n\n\"God give us enough! We'll only need the one wire. The thing is plugged\nin already and only the positive pole has to be connected to the globe.\nCome on!\"\n\nScooping up the assortment of metal articles, they rushed across the\nroom. With his pocket-knife, Dave Miller began breaking up the metal\nwrist-watch straps, opening the links out so that they could be laid\nend-to-end for the greatest possible length. They patiently broke the\nwatches to pieces, and of the junk they garnered made a ragged foot and\na half of \"wire.\" Their coins stretched the line still further.\n\nThey had ten feet covered before the stuff was half used up. Their metal\npencils, taken apart, gave them a good two feet. Key chains helped\ngenerously. With eighteen feet covered, their progress began to slow\ndown.\n\nPerspiration poured down Miller's face. Desperately, he tore off his\nlodge ring and cut it in two to pound it flat. From garters and\nsuspenders they won a few inches more. And then--they stopped--feet from\ntheir goal.\n\nMiller groaned. He tossed his pocket-knife in his hand.\n\n\"We can get a foot out of this,\" he estimated. \"But that still leaves us\nway short.\"\n\nAbruptly, Erickson snapped his fingers.\n\n\"Shoes!\" he gasped. \"They're full of nails. Get to work with that knife,\nDave. We'll cut out every one of 'em!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn ten minutes, the shoes were reduced to ragged piles of tattered\nleather. Erickson's deft fingers painstakingly placed the nails, one by\none, in the line. The distance left to cover was less than six inches!\n\nHe lined up the last few nails. Then both men were sinking back on their\nheels, as they saw there was a gap of three inches to cover!\n\n\"Beaten!\" Erickson ground out. \"By three inches! Three inches from the\npresent ... and yet it might as well be a million miles!\"\n\nMiller's body felt as though it were in a vise. His muscles ached with\nstrain. So taut were his nerves that he leaped as though stung when\nMajor nuzzled a cool nose into his hand again. Automatically, he began\nto stroke the dog's neck.\n\n\"Well, that licks us,\" he muttered. \"There isn't another piece of\nmovable metal in the world.\"\n\nMajor kept whimpering and pushing against him. Annoyed, the druggist\nshoved him away.\n\n\"Go 'way,\" he muttered. \"I don't feel like--\"\n\nSuddenly then his eyes widened, as his touch encountered warm metal. He\nwhirled.\n\n\"There it is!\" he yelled. \"The last link. _The nameplate on Major's\ncollar!_\"\n\nIn a flash, he had torn the little rectangular brass plate from the dog\ncollar. Erickson took it from his grasp. Sweat stood shiny on his skin.\nHe held the bit of metal over the gap between wire and pole.\n\n\"This is it!\" he smiled brittlely. \"We're on our way, Dave. Where, I\ndon't know. To death, or back to life. But--we're going!\"\n\nThe metal clinked into place. Live, writhing power leaped through the\nwire, snarling across partial breaks. The transformers began to hum. The\nhumming grew louder. Singing softly, the bronze globe over their heads\nglowed green. Dave Miller felt a curious lightness. There was a snap in\nhis brain, and Erickson, Major and the laboratory faded from his senses.\n\nThen came an interval when the only sound was the soft sobbing he had\nbeen hearing as if in a dream. That, and blackness that enfolded him\nlike soft velvet. Then Miller was opening his eyes, to see the familiar\nwalls of his own kitchen around him!\n\nSomeone cried out.\n\n\"Dave! Oh, Dave, dear!\"\n\nIt was Helen's voice, and it was Helen who cradled his head in her lap\nand bent her face close to his.\n\n\"Oh, thank God that you're alive--!\"\n\n\"Helen!\" Miller murmured. \"What--are--you--doing here?\"\n\n\"I couldn't go through with it. I--I just couldn't leave you. I came\nback and--and I heard the shot and ran in. The doctor should be here. I\ncalled him five minutes ago.\"\n\n\"_Five minutes_ ... How long has it been since I shot myself?\"\n\n\"Oh, just six or seven minutes. I called the doctor right away.\"\n\nMiller took a deep breath. Then it _must_ have been a dream. All\nthat--to happen in a few minutes-- It wasn't possible!\n\n\"How--how could I have botched the job?\" he muttered. \"I wasn't drunk\nenough to miss myself completely.\"\n\nHelen looked at the huge revolver lying in the sink.\n\n\"Oh, that old forty-five of Grandfather's! It hasn't been loaded since\nthe Civil War. I guess the powder got damp or something. It just sort of\nsputtered instead of exploding properly. Dave, promise me something!\nYou won't ever do anything like this again, if I promise not to nag\nyou?\"\n\nDave Miller closed his eyes. \"There won't be any need to nag, Helen.\nSome people take a lot of teaching, but I've had my lesson. I've got\nideas about the store which I'd been too lazy to try out. You know, I\nfeel more like fighting right now than I have for years! We'll lick 'em,\nwon't we, honey?\"\n\nHelen buried her face in the hollow of his shoulder and cried softly.\nHer words were too muffled to be intelligible. But Dave Miller\nunderstood what she meant.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe had thought the whole thing a dream--John Erickson, the \"time\nimpulsor\" and Major. But that night he read an item in the _Evening\nCourier_ that was to keep him thinking for many days.\n\n    POLICE INVESTIGATE DEATH OF SCIENTIST HERE IN LABORATORY\n\n    John M. Erickson, director of the Wanamaker Institute, died at his\n    work last night. Erickson was a beloved and valuable figure in the\n    world of science, famous for his recently publicized \"time lapse\"\n    theory.\n\n    Two strange circumstances surrounded his death. One was the presence\n    of a German shepherd dog in the laboratory, its head crushed as if\n    with a sledgehammer. The other was a chain of small metal objects\n    stretching from one corner of the room to the other, as if intended\n    to take the place of wire in a circuit.\n\n    Police, however, discount this idea, as there was a roll of wire\n    only a few feet from the body.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[1] Obviously this electric time impulsor is a machine in the nature of\nan atomic integrator. It \"broadcasts\" great waves of electrons which\nalign all atomic objects in rigid suspension.\n\nThat is to say, atomic structures are literally \"frozen.\" Living bodies\nare similarly affected. It is a widely held belief on the part of many\neminent scientists that all matter, broken down into its elementary\natomic composition, is electrical in structure.\n\nThat being so, there is no reason to suppose why Professor Erickson may\nnot have discovered a time impulsor which, broadcasting electronic\nimpulses, \"froze\" everything within its range.--ED.\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ April 1956 and was\n    first published in _Amazing Stories_ October 1940.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
