But there\n was only one way the poor consumer\n could rise up in his wrath._\n\n\n\"I've sweated for months over the plans for this campaign,\" Captain\nWesley Winfree told the Major. \"Just nod, sir; that's all I ask; and\nI'll throw my forces into the field.\"\n\n\"I admire your audacity, Winfree,\" Major Stanley Dampfer said, \"but\ndon't you think we'd be wise to consolidate our current positions before\nlaunching a fresh offensive?\"\n\nCaptain Winfree, straight in his scarlet-trimmed winter greens, tapped\nthe toe of one boot with his swagger-stick. \"With all respect, sir,\" he\nsaid, \"I feel that if we do no more than hold the line, we're lending\nmoral comfort to the foes of prosperity. Attack! That's my battle-plan,\nsir. Attack! And attack again!\"\n\nMajor Dampfer, seated behind Winfree's desk, stretched out his legs and\nsighed. \"You younger officers, men who've never in your lives tasted\ndefeat, are an inspiration and a trial to us old field-graders,\" he\nsaid. \"Captain, a project that failed could set your District back\nfifteen years.\"\n\n\"I realize that, sir,\" Winfree said. \"I'm placing my career in the\nbalance. If I attempt this, and goof, ship me to the sticks, Major. I'd\nrather spend the rest of my BSG years as a corporal, a simple Potlatch\nObserver in a downstate village, than never to have embarked on this\ncampaign.\"\n\n\"Young Napoleon must have been very like you, Winfree,\" Major Dampfer\nmused. \"Very well, lad. Brief me.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\" Captain Winfree marched over to the giant calendar that\ncovered one wall of his office and tapped his stick against the three\ndates circled in red. \"We've established this triangle of\nstrong-points,\" he said. \"We control the second Sunday in May and the\nthird Sunday in June in addition to our first and most vital holding,\nthe twenty-fifth of December. I regard these three victories, sir, as\nonly beachheads, only the softening-up phases of a still greater\ncampaign. We must press on toward Total Prosperity.\"\n\n\"How, Winfree?\" Major Dampfer asked.\n\n\"By adding three hundred and sixty-two days a year to our laurels, sir,\"\nWinfree said, sweeping his swagger-stick across the face of the\ncalendar. \"My plan is to make every consumer's birthday a Gratuity Day\nfor each of his Nearest-and-Dearest.\"\n\nMajor Dampfer sat up straight. \"Captain,\" he said softly, \"this is\nThinking Big. This could lend billions a year to the Gross National\nProduct. It could mean a major break-through on the Prosperity front.\nAre you really proposing that each consumer be required to give birthday\npresents to the same people, and on the same scale, as he now gives Xmas\nGratuities?\"\n\n\"Precisely, sir,\" Captain Winfree said. \"My staff has in the files the\nbirthdate of every consumer in the District. Enforcement of the new\nquotas I propose will be no more difficult than the old: the same scale\nof fines for non-compliance, the same terms of imprisonment for repeated\noffenses will be imposed. The dates-of-destruction to be marked on\nBirthday Gratuities will be set as the next Potlatch Day, plus one year.\nMerchandise will be marked with the year-date precisely as is now done\nfor Xmas, Dad's Day, and Mom's Day gifts. Birthday-cards will be\naddressed and sent from this office, just like Xmas cards.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMajor Dampfer stood and drew on his uniform gauntlets. \"May I assume\nthat you've covered the field public-relations-wise?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Captain Winfree said. \"I've composed a slogan for this\nyear's drive in my District: 'Make the Magi Come the Year\n'Round--Birthday Gratuities for All!'\"\n\n\"It sings, Winfree,\" Major Dampfer said. \"I like it. Captain, you have\nmy nod. Carry on with this program. If you win the battle for this\nDistrict, I'll get you a desk in Washington and Divisional Command;\nyou'll help us tailor your plan to fit the entire nation.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" Winfree said, grinning. \"I won't disappoint you.\"\n\n\"You'd best not,\" the Major said. He paused by the office door. \"Captain\nWinfree, the word is on the grapevine that you're planning to marry one\nof the corporals in your office. That right?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Winfree said. \"Peggy and I have set the wedding for\ntwenty-three December, the day before Potlatch. We'd be delighted\nshould your duties allow you to attend, Major.\"\n\n\"I'll be there,\" Major Dampfer promised. \"And as a little gift from the\nBureau of Seasonal Gratuities, Winfree, I order you to move out on your\nnew campaign that same day: twenty-three December.\" He raised a\ngauntleted hand. \"No, Captain! Don't protest that you'll be needed here.\nYour work is strategy, not tactics. Your plans can be implemented by\nyour staff while you're off on your honeymoon.\"\n\n\"Whatever you say, sir,\" Winfree said.\n\n\"I'd be further gratified,\" the Major continued, \"if you'd hold the\nceremony right here in your Headquarters Building. We of the BSG must\nestablish some traditions, Winfree; the other Services have a\ncentury-and-a-half's lead on us in that field. So, if the lovely\ncorporal approves, we'll make yours a proper military wedding.\"\n\n\"All this is very good of you, sir,\" Captain Winfree said. \"I'm certain\nPeggy will be pleased.\"\n\n\"Good!\" Major Dampfer said. \"I'll handle all the details. Winfree,\nyou've got the quality we used to know as Old-Fashioned Intestinal\nFortitude, back in the day when a spade was called a spade and no\napologies about it. We need more men like you in the Bureau.\" He snapped\na salute. \"Carry on, Captain; and Happy Potlatch!\"\n\n\"A Very Happy Potlatch to you, sir!\" Winfree said, tossing back the\nsalute. \"And a Merry Xmas!\"\n\nCaptain Winfree walked to the big window in the outer office to watch\nMajor Dampfer driven off in his sergeant-chauffeured, scarlet-and-green\nBSG Rolls limousine. Then he about-faced without warning to glare at his\nlittle command, the eight non-coms, the twenty-seven Other Ranks, the\nfour young lieutenants. They all sat silent, watching him as though\nwaiting for confirmation of an unpleasant rumor. Not a file-cabinet\nstood open, not a typewriter was moving. \"Listen, you people,\" Winfree\ngrowled, pointing his swagger-stick like a weapon, not sparing even\nCorporal Peggy MacHenery his anger; \"We've got a Potlatch Day coming up,\nthe biggest ever. Now get on the ball, dammit! I don't want to see one\nof you stopping for breath again till Xmas Day.\" The lieutenants and\nsergeants flushed; the girl privates jumped their fingers onto\ntypewriter keys. \"Corporal MacHenery,\" Winfree said, \"bring your notepad\nto my office.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPeggy MacHenery, Corporal, Bureau of Seasonal Gratuities, followed her\ncommanding officer and husband-designate into his office. \"Close the\ndoor, Corporal,\" Winfree said. Peggy did so, and took her chair next to\nhis desk, the pad open on her knee and her fountain pen at the ready.\n\"No dictation,\" Captain Winfree said. \"Please forgive me for taking\nvaluable official time for a personal matter, Corporal; especially\nafter that little display of tyranny I just put on out there. Peggy,\nMajor Dampfer has ordered us to hold our wedding here at District\nHeadquarters. He'll bring in a transport loaded with BSG brass, fly in a\nband to give us a send-off with pibrochs and marches and double-flams;\nand he'll probably set up an arch of sabers for us to parade through. Do\nyou mind all this very much, Peggy?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe snapped her notepad shut. \"Daddy will be furious,\" she said.\n\n\"Your dad is already so worked up about your marrying me, a BSG-man,\nthat a little extra anger won't even show,\" Winfree said. \"I'm convinced\nthat he's teaching me fencing only in hopes I'll have a fatal accident.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" Peggy said. She tossed her notebook on the desk and stood to\ntake Winfree's hand. \"Don't make Daddy out a monster, Wes. About the\nother thing, the military wedding, I don't care. I'd marry you in a\nbeer-barrel, if you wanted it that way.\"\n\nCaptain Winfree took the girl's free hand. \"Peggy,\" he said, \"you're the\ngreatest! Now the good news. Major Dampfer has approved my plans for\ninstituting Birthday Gratuity Quotas in this District. Aren't you glad\nfor me?\"\n\n\"Glad?\" Peggy demanded, pulling away. \"Wes, do you think the consumers\nof this District will put up with another invasion of their pocketbooks,\nlet alone their private sentiments?\"\n\n\"Peggy, if you're going to gripe every time the Bureau raises the quotas\na notch,\" Winfree said, \"you don't belong in that uniform you're\nwearing.\"\n\n\"Want me to take it off?\" Peggy challenged, reaching for the top button\nof her blouse.\n\n\"No, dammit!\" Winfree said. \"But if you're going to discuss the\npropriety of every decision I make, please have the grace to wait till\nwe're outside District Headquarters to do it.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; thank you, sir,\" Peggy said. She saluted. \"Is there anything\nmore you want to chew me out about, sir?\"\n\nWinfree saluted back, then growled at himself for the reflex. \"Woman,\"\nhe said, \"once we're married I want to see your request for discharge\nlying here on my desk. How the devil can an officer run an organization\nwhen one of the enlisted personnel, the corporal he's in love with,\npersists in subordination?\"\n\n\"I can't quit,\" Peggy said. \"We'll need my salary, Wes, if only to pay\noff our BSG quotas. What with buying Xmas presents, gifts for Mom's Day\nand Pop's Day, and sending Birthday Gratuities to every name on our\ncombined Nearest-and-Dearest lists, we'll be living on rice and soybeans\ntill you make Light Colonel. Quit? Wes, if you expect to eat regular\nafter we're married, you'd best put me in for sergeant's stripes.\"\n\n\"Please, Peggy,\" Winfree asked. \"We'll discuss this all tonight, off\nduty, if I survive your father's swordplay. For now, please let letters\nout to all District wholesalers, telling them of the Birthday Quotas and\nthe new dating procedures. Have one of the lieutenants open the _secret_\nfiles for you--it's all under 'Operation Nativity.' You can get at it\nright away.\"\n\n\"Very well, Captain, sir,\" Peggy said. \"Happy Potlatch, sir.\" She\nabout-faced and marched out, banging the office door behind her.\n\n\"Happy Potlatch be damned!\" Captain Winfree said, flinging his\nswagger-stick toward the calendar.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe MacHenery home was all gables and pinnacles and spooled\nporch-pillars, very like an enormous wedding-cake, every horizontal\nsurface now frosted with a thin layer of snow. Captain Winfree tugged\noff his gauntlets, rang the bell, and stood straighter than usual to\nwithstand the hostile inspection of Kevin MacHenery, Peggy's father.\n\nMr. MacHenery opened the door. Captain Winfree, although retaining his\nsmile of greeting, groaned inwardly. MacHenery was wearing his canvas\nfencing outfit, flat-soled shoes, and carried a foil in one hand. \"My\nyou are a gorgeous sight, all Kelly-green and scarlet piping, like a\ntropical bird that's somehow strayed into the snowfields,\" MacHenery\nsaid. \"Do come in, Captain, and warm your feathers.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" Winfree said, brushing the snow from his cap. He\npeeled off his overcoat and hung it on the hall tree, sticking his\nswagger-stick in one of its pockets. \"Peggy busy?\" he asked, hoping that\nher appearance would preclude his being given another unsolicited\nfencing-lesson.\n\n\"After having spent two hours in the bathroom with a curry-comb and a\nbottle of wave-set,\" MacHenery said, \"my daughter has finally got down\nto work in the kitchen. We have time for an engagement at steel in the\nparlor, if you'd care to refine your style, Captain.\"\n\n\"Just as you say, sir,\" Winfree said.\n\n\"Your politeness offends me, Wes,\" Kevin MacHenery complained, handing\nhim a foil and a wire-mesh mask. \"Slip off your shoes. It's a terrible\nburden you are laying on the shoulders of an aging man, being so\nwell-spoken when he likes nothing more than an argument. Now assume the\n_on guard_ position, Wesley.\"\n\nWinfree obediently placed his feet at right angles, raised his foil, and\n\"sat down,\" assuming the bent-leg position and feeling his leg-muscles,\nstill sore from his last session with MacHenery, begin to complain.\n\"You're holding your foil like a flyswatter,\" MacHenery said. \"Here,\nlike this!\"\n\n\"None of that, Daddy,\" Peggy said, appearing from the kitchen. \"I'll\nnot have you two sitting down to eat all sweaty and out of breath, like\nlast time Wes was over here.\"\n\n\"She treats me like a backward child,\" MacHenery said. He took a bottle\nfrom a shelf and poured generous dollops of Scotch into two glasses, one\nof which he handed to Winfree. \"Inasmuch as I disapprove of the coming\nseason,\" he said, \"I'll offer you no toast, Captain.\"\n\n\"You don't care even for Xmas?\" Winfree asked in a tone of mild\nreproach.\n\n\"Ex-mas?\" MacHenery demanded. \"What the devil is this nor-fish-nor-fowl\nthing you call Ex-mas? Some new festival, perhaps, celebrated by\ncarillons of cash-register chimes?\"\n\n\"_Christmas_, if you prefer, sir,\" Winfree said. \"We in the Bureau of\nSeasonal Gratuities get used to using the other name. We use the word so\nmuch in writing that cutting it from nine letters to four saves some\nthirty thousand dollars annually, in this District alone.\"\n\n\"That's grand,\" MacHenery said. He sat down with his whiskey. \"Simply\ngrand.\"\n\n\"We could drink to a Happy Potlatch,\" Captain Winfree suggested.\n\n\"I'd sooner toast my imminent death by tetanus,\" MacHenery said.\n\n\"I'd like to taste this stuff,\" Winfree said. \"Let's compromise. Can we\ndrink to Peggy?\"\n\n\"Accepted,\" MacHenery said, raising his glass. \"To my Peggy--our Peggy.\"\nHe gave the whiskey the concentration it deserved. Then, \"You know,\nWesley,\" he said, \"if you weren't in the BSG I could like you real well.\nI'd rejoice at your becoming my son-in-law. Too bad that you wear the\nenemy uniform.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"The BSG is hardly an enemy,\" Winfree said. \"It's been an American\ninstitution for a long time. This is excellent whiskey.\"\n\n\"We'll test a second sample, to see whether its quality stands up\nthrough the bottle,\" MacHenery suggested. \"For all we know, they may be\nputting the best on top.\" He poured them each another. \"Yes, Wesley, the\nBureau of Seasonal Gratuities has been with the American consumer quite\na while. Twenty years it'll be, come next Potlatch Day. You were brought\nup in the foul tradition, Wes. You don't know what our country was like\nin the good old days, when Christmas was spelled with a _C_ instead of\nan _X_.\"\n\n\"I know that a paltry twenty billion dollars a year were spent on\nXmas--sorry, sir--on Christmas Gratuities, back before my Bureau came on\nthe scene to triple that figure, to bring us all greater prosperity.\"\n\n\"Your Bureau brought us the stink of burning,\" MacHenery said. \"It\nbrought us the Potlatch Pyres.\"\n\n\"Yes, Potlatch!\" Captain Winfree said. \"Potlatch Pyres and Potlatch\nDay--childhood's brightest memory. Ah, those smells from the fire! The\nincense of seared varnish; the piny smoke from building-blocks tossed\ninto the flames; the thick wool stinks of dated shirts and cowboy-suits,\ngasoline-soaked and tossed into the Potlatch Pyre. My little brother,\npadded fat in his snowsuit, toddling up to the fire to toss in his dated\nsled, then scampering back from the sparks while Mom and Dad smiled at\nhim from the porch, cuddling hot cups of holiday ponchero in their\nhands.\"\n\n\"Seduction of the innocents,\" MacHenery said. \"Training the babes to be\nwastrels.\"\n\n\"We loved it,\" Winfree insisted. \"True, the little girls might cry as\nthey handed a dated doll to the BSG-man; while he prepared it for suttee\nwith a wash of gasoline and set it into the fire; but little girls, as I\nsuppose you know, relish occasions for weeping. They cheered up mighty\nquick, believe me, when the thermite grenades were set off, filling the\nnight air with the electric smell of molten metal, burning dated clocks\nand desk-lamps, radios and humidors, shoes and ships and carving-sets;\nburning them down to smoke and golden-glowing puddles under the ashes of\nthe Potlatch Pyre. Then the fireworks, Mr. MacHenery. The fireworks! The\nBSG-man touching a flaming torch to the fuses of the mortars; a sizzle\nand a burst; the Japanese star-shells splitting the sky, splashing\nacross the night's ceiling, scattering from their pods, blossoming into\nQueen Anne's Lace in a dozen colors of fire.\"\n\n\"Fire and destruction,\" MacHenery said. \"There's your holiday for\nchildren--fire and destruction!\"\n\n\"You missed it, sir,\" Winfree said. \"You don't understand. Potlatch is\na wonderful day for children, a glorious introduction to the science of\neconomics. The boys light Roman candles, shooting crimson and orchid\nand brass-flamed astonishers into the clouds. A soft fog of snow makes\nfuzzy smears of the pinwheels, of the children racing, sparklers in\nboth hands, across the frozen lawn. Dad lights the strings of\ncannon-crackers--at our house they used to dangle from a wire strung\nacross the porch, like clusters of giant phlox--and they convulse into\nlife, jumping and banging and scattering their red skins onto the snow,\nfilling the air with the spice of gunpowder.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"The high-school kids come home from their Potlatch Parties ...\"\n\n\"Wreckage and mayhem,\" MacHenery grunted. \"We used to throw the same\nkind of parties when I was a tad, but they were against the law, back\nthen. We called 'em chicken-runs.\"\n\n\"But nowadays, sir, those Potlatch Parties contribute to the general\nprosperity,\" Winfree explained. \"Used-car lots used to border all the\ndowntown streets, anchors on progress. Now those dated cars are\nsmashed, and used for scrap. The high-school drivers work off their\naggressions ramming them together. And there's no mayhem, Mr. MacHenery;\nthe BSG-man assigned to Potlatch Parties strap the kids in safe and make\nsure their crash-helmets fit tight. It's all clean fun.\"\n\n\"Morally,\" MacHenery said, \"Potlatch Parties are still chicken-runs.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPeggy came back, as sleek and crisp as though cooking were an expensive\nsort of beauty treatment. \"Supper will be ready in five minutes,\" she\nsaid. \"If you tigers will wash up ...\"\n\n\"We'll drink up, first,\" her father said. \"This man of yours has been\nfeeding me BSG propaganda. I'm not sure I have any appetite left.\"\n\n\"What started you hating the Bureau of Seasonal Gratuities, Mr.\nMacHenery?\" Winfree said.\n\nMacHenery poured them each a drink. \"You ever read Suetonius, Wes?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"Yours is a generation of monoglots,\" MacHenery sighed. \"It figures,\nthough. There's no profit in having today's youth read the clinical\nrecord of another civilization that died of self-indulgence, that went\nroistering to its doom in a carnival of bloat.\"\n\n\"Doom?\" Winfree asked.\n\n\"Doom richly deserved,\" MacHenery said. \"Old Suetonius describes, for\nexample, an instrument that accompanied dinner-parties during the reigns\nof the last few Caesars. It was a device that accomplished, two thousand\nyears ago, the function of our proud Bureau of Seasonal Gratuities. A\nfeather, my boy. A simple goose-quill.\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" Winfree said.\n\n\"I'd be hurt if you did, Captain,\" MacHenery said. \"I've set my mind on\nexplaining the point. Now you see, Wes, the late Caesars were pretty\ngood consumers of everything but petroleum, we having that edge on them.\nThey spread a mighty fine table. A gourmet would bring to Rome caviar\nfrom the Caucasus, peaches from Majorca, and, for all I know, kippers\nfrom Britain. Picture it, Wesley: cherries served in golden bowls,\nheaped on the snow trotted down from mountain-tops by marathons of\nslaves. A dish called The Shield of Minerva was one of their greatest\ndelights; this being an Irish stew compounded of lamprey-milt,\npike-livers, flamingo-tongues, and the tiny, tasty brains of pheasants\nand peacocks; eaten while viewing the floor-show of strip-teasing\nCircassian girls or--Galba's invention, this--elephants walking\ntight-rope. Grand, Wes. No meals like that at the supermarket; no shows\nlike that even on the television.\"\n\n\"But the feather?\" Winfree prompted.\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" MacHenery said. \"The moment our noble Roman had eaten his\nfill he'd pick up the feather next to his plate and, excusing himself,\nadjourn to the adjoining vomitorium. A few tickles of the palate, and\nhis first meal would be only a lovely memory. He'd saunter back to his\nbench by the table again, ready to set to with another helping of\nMinerva's Shield.\"\n\n\"Disgusting,\" Winfree said.\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" MacHenery agreed, smiling and fitting his fingertips\ntogether. \"Now attend my simile, Captain. Unlike those feathered Romans\nof the Decadence, we moderns settle for one meal at a sitting, and let\nit digest in peace. We have instead our more sophisticated greeds,\nwhetted by subtle persuasions and an assurance that it's really quite\nmoral to ransom our future for today's gimmicks.\"\n\n\"Prosperity requires the cooperation of every citizen,\" Captain Winfree\nsaid, quoting an early slogan of the BSG.\n\n\"Your artificial prosperity requires us, the moment we're sated with\nchrome chariots and miracle-fiber dressing-gowns and electronic magics,\nthe minute our children have toys enough to last them through the age of\nfranchise, to take in hand the feather forced upon us by regulation of\nthe Bureau of Seasonal Gratuities and visit the parish Potlatch Pyre,\nour modern vomitorium, to spew up last year's dainties to make\nbelly-room for a new lot,\" MacHenery said.\n\n\"Daddy!\" Peggy MacHenery protested from the living-room doorway. \"What\nsort of table-talk is that?\"\n\n\"Truth is the sweetest sauce, Peggy,\" MacHenery said, getting up from\nhis chair. \"What delights have you cooked up for us, child?\"\n\n\"Your favorite dish, Daddy,\" Peggy said, grinning at him. \"Peacock\nbrains on toast.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe next two weeks were too busy for Captain Winfree to partner Kevin\nMacHenery on the fencing-mat. He was double-busy, in fact; planning the\nbiggest Potlatch Day in twenty years at the same time he started the\nwheels of his project to make birthdays Gratuity Days for every consumer\nin his District.\n\nThe girls, assisted by two of the male sergeants, had decorated the\nDistrict Headquarters till it glittered like a child's dream of the\nNorth Pole. Against one wall they'd placed the Xmas tree, its branches\nbearing dozens of dancing elves, Japanese swordsmen, marching squads of\nBSG-recruits, prancing circus-ponies; all watch-work figures busy with\nmovement, flashing with microscopic lights, humming little melodies that\nmatched their motions. A giant replica of the Bureau's cap-emblem--the\nFederal eagle clutching between his talons a banderole bearing the\nmotto, _'Tis More Blessed to Give Than Receive_--had been mounted on the\ncenter wall, the place of honor. Beneath the eagle stood a bandstand\ndraped in bunting, ready to accommodate the Bureau of Seasonal\nGratuities Brass-Band-and-Glee-Club, the members of which were to fly in\nfrom Washington to grace the bridal day with epithalamiums and martial\nsong.\n\nThe big work, the eight-hours-a-day and after-supper-overtime work, was\nthe preparation for Potlatch Day, the festival that meant to the BSG\nwhat April Fifteenth means to the Internal Revenue Service. Cases of\nfireworks piled up in the brick warehouse next door to Headquarters.\nSawdust-packed thermite grenades were stacked right up to the perforated\npipes of the sprinkler system. _No Smoking_ sign blossomed a hundred\nyards on every side. The blacklists, naming consumers who'd withheld\ndated gifts from the Potlatch Pyres of earlier years, were brought up to\ndate and distributed to the Reserve BSG Officers in each township of\nWinfree's District. These holdouts, it was safe to assume, would be\nunder surveillance on Potlatch Day. Cold-eyed sergeants and lieutenants\nwould make note of the material each of them consigned to the flames,\nand would cross-check their notes with Nearest-and-Dearest lists to make\nsure that all post-dated Mom's Day and Dad's Day gratuities, all of last\nXmas's gifts, had been destroyed as required by BSG ordinance.\n\nMeanwhile letters piled into Captain Winfree's office, thousands of them\neach time the Post Office truck stopped outside Headquarters. Several of\nthese were penned in a brownish stuff purported to be their authors'\nlifeblood; and all voiced indignation against Schedule 121B, Table 12,\nwhich set minimum levels of cost for the birthday gratuities they'd have\nto give each of the fifteen persons on their Nearest-and-Dearest lists.\nHundreds of protests were printed in the vox populi columns of District\nnewspapers, recommending every printable form of violence against agents\nof the Bureau. BSG practice was to regard with benign eye public outcry\nof this sort. No consumer in Winfree's District, immersed as he was in\nthe debate over Birthday Gratuity Minima, could possibly plead ignorance\nshould he be apprehended in violation of these new regulations.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFinally, it was two days before Xmas, Potlatch Day Minus One.\nPhone-calls had rippled out from District Headquarters, calling all BSG\nReservists to the colors, assigning them to Potlatch Duty in the\ntownships or patrol in the city; telling each officer and non-com where\nand when to submit his requisition for pyrotechnical devices, gasoline,\nthermite bombs, and pads of BSG Form No. 217-C, \"Incident of Consumer\nNon-Compliance.\" And the day was even more than this. It was the day\nCaptain Wesley Winfree was to wed Corporal Margaret MacHenery in the\nsight of God, man, and the glitteringest crowd of BSG brass ever\nassembled outside Washington.\n\nBy noon the typewriters in Headquarters were covered and shoved with\ntheir desks behind folding screens hung with pine-boughs. Every wheel in\nthe District motor pool was on the highway from the airport, shuttling\nin the wedding-party. The bride, closeted in an anteroom with a gaggle\nof envious bachelor-girls, was dressing herself in winter greens, her\nchevrons brilliant against her sleeves. Peggy had pinned a tiny\npoinsettia to her lapel; strictly against Regulations; but who'd have\nthe heart to reprimand so lovely a bride? The minister who was to\nperform the wedding, a young captain-chaplain of BSG, paced amongst the\nhidden desks, memorizing the greetings he'd composed to precede the\nformal words of wedding. The guests came laughing through a corridor of\npotted pines into the District Headquarters, where they were greeted by\nthe BSG Band-and-Glee-Club's rendition of the Bureau's official anthem,\n\"I'm Dreaming of a White Potlatch.\" As though it had been arranged by\nWashington, snow had indeed begun to fall; and the tiers of overcoats\nracked in the outer hall were beaded with melted flakes.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe groom, wearing his dress greens--the winter uniform worn with white\nshirt and a scarlet bow-tie--was still trapped behind his desk, hardly\nconscious of the joyful noises from beyond the door. \"They haven't\nshown?\" he bellowed into the telephone. \"Don't fret your head about it,\nSergeant. Those Reservists will damned well be on duty tomorrow morning\nor we'll have their cans in a courtroom before dark.\" Slam! An anxious\ngirl Pfc tiptoed in. \"Sir, a consumer's delegation wishes to speak with\nyou about the new Birthday Quotas.\"\n\n\"Tell them they're stuck with it,\" Winfree snapped. \"Hand these around\nthat delegation, Soldier,\" he said, shoving a stack of Schedules 1219B\nacross his desk toward the girl. \"Tell that bunch of complainers I'll\nkeep this District's economy healthy if I have to jail every consumer in\nit.\"\n\nThe phone rang again. \"It's me, Wes, Peggy.\"\n\n\"Darling, I'm busy,\" Winfree said.\n\n\"Didn't you write our wedding-date on your appointment list?\" she asked.\n\"It'll only take a quarter-hour.\"\n\n\"Don't marry anyone else,\" Winfree said. \"I'll be right out.\" He hung up\nthe phone and stood at the mirror in his closet to check his uniform.\nThen he picked up his silver-trimmed dress swagger-stick and marched out\ninto the main office to meet the chaplain, and his wife.\n\nMajor Stanley Dampfer, glorious in his dress greens, a Sam Bowie belt\nequating his belly and supporting the side-arm holstered by one big hip,\nslapped Winfree on the back as he entered the hall. \"At ease!\" the\nMajor shouted, then glanced contritely toward the two BSG colonels who'd\nbeen talking the loudest. \"Gentlemen, ladies: I want to present the\nfounder of this feast, the brightest star in the Bureau's firmament, the\nyoung genius of Birthday Gratuity Quotas. I refer, of course, to Captain\nWesley Winfree!\"\n\n[Applause, shouts, a few ribald remarks from the officers nearest the\nbar]\n\n\"I just want to tell you all,\" the Major went on, his arm heavy across\nWinfree's unwilling shoulders, \"before I relinquish this fine young\nofficer to his new commander, a corporal ...\"\n\n[Laughter]\n\n\"... that here's a man who's going places. Look well at Captain\nWinfree's face, friends. You will see it yet on the cover of _Time_,\nabove a pair of stars.\"\n\n[Applause]\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Major freed Captain Winfree, the guests settled down into their\nfolding-chairs, and the chaplain opened his BSG _Book of Authorized\nCeremonies_. He and the affianced couple stood alone together in a\nmoment of silence. He opened the service. \"Dearly beloved, we are\ngathered together here ...\n\n\"... Margaret, wilt thou have this Man to thy wedded husband ... so long\nas ye both shall live? ... by virtue of the authority vested in me by\nthe Corps of Chaplains, Bureau of Seasonal Gratuities, I pronounce that\nyou are Man and Wife. Amen, and Congratulations!\"\n\nThe first wedded kiss, and the stag-line demanding its similar\nperquisite. Kevin MacHenery seized his son-in-law's right hand. \"I wish\nyou both fifty happy years, Wes,\" he said. \"I hope you'll see the light\nsoon, and spend most of those years in decent mufti.\" Major Dampfer\nshouldered Mr. MacHenery aside to tug Winfree and his new wife toward\nthe mountain of gifts, covered like a giant's corpse with a sheet,\nstanding by the base of the Xmas tree. The Major triumphantly pulled a\nripcord, and the sheet dropped away. Beneath it were dozens of boxes and\nbundles and bottles, wrapped in scarlet and green and silver and gold.\n\"Open them!\" some guest prompted from the end of the hall.\n\n\"Why open them?\" Corporal Mrs. Peggy Winfree asked. \"Anyone got a match?\nWe'll have our Potlatch Pyre right here and now, burn them right off\ninstead of waiting a year.\"\n\n\"The lady jests,\" Major Dampfer assumed. \"Wedding-gifts, Corporal,\naren't subject to Potlatching.\"\n\n\"Goody,\" Peggy said.\n\n\"I'll have some of the enlisted guests carry these gratuities out to\nyour car,\" the Major said. \"You can unwrap them during your honeymoon.\"\nHe chuckled.\n\nTowing his bride with his left hand, accepting handshakes with his\nright, Captain Winfree shouldered his way through the mob of brass and\nchevrons to the door. His car, adorned with a _Just Married_ sign that\ncompletely obscured the rear window, trailing strings of shoes and empty\nmilk-tins, stood at the end of a corridor formed by two face-to-face\nranks of BSG Officer-Candidates. The OCS-men wore dress greens and\nAcademy helmets, and about the waist of each hung a saber. Consumers\nstood gray and inconspicuous behind the two rows of uniformed men,\nsilent, unsmiling, like onlookers at an accident. Captain Winfree looked\nover this civilian crowd. Each person wore, pinned to a lapel, perched\nin a hatbrim, or worn like a corsage, a small white feather. \"We'd best\nhurry, Peggy,\" he said, urging her toward the gantlet.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Officer-Candidates, on a signal from Major Dampfer, snicked their\nceremonial sabers from their scabbards and presented them, blade-tip to\nblade-tip, as an archway. The BSG Band-and-Glee-Club, playing and\nsinging, \"Potlatch Is Comin' to Town,\" stood in the doorway. Captain\nWinfree, clasping Peggy's gloved hand tightly, led her through the\nsaber-roofed aisleway as rapidly as he could. \"What's the rush, Wes?\"\nshe asked. \"We'll get married only once, and I'd like to see the\nceremony well enough to be able to describe it to our eventual children,\nwhen they ask me what it was like.\"\n\nWinfree opened the door of their car. \"We'd better get out of here,\" he\nsaid. \"I smell a riot brewing; and I don't want you to have to describe\nthat to our children.\"\n\nPeggy scooted into the car just as the District Headquarters building\nburped out a giant bubble of smoke. An arm reached out to Winfree's\nlapel and tugged him back from the car. \"You're going nowhere, buddy,\" a\ncivilian growled at him. The man, Winfree saw, was wearing the\nubiquitous white feather in his lapel. As Winfree shook himself free\nfrom the civilian, the arch of sabers above them collapsed. The\nBSG-OCS-men were tossed about in a mob of suddenly screaming consumers,\nwaving their weapons as ineffectively as brooms. Fragments were spun off\nthe whirl of people, bits of BSG uniforms torn off their wearers and\ntossed like confetti. A huge pink figure, clad in one trouser-leg and a\npair of shorts, smeared across the chest and face with soot, dashed\ntoward Winfree, waving a .45 pistol. \"Stop this violence!\" he screamed\nat the consumers in his way, leveling his pistol. \"Maintain the peace,\ndammit! or I'll shoot!\"\n\n\"That idiot!\" Winfree said. He slammed the door of the car to give Peggy\na little protection, then scooped up a handful of snow from the gutter\nto pound into a ball and toss like a grenade at the back of Major\nDampfer's neck. The Major's boots flew out from under him, and he\nlanded belly-down in the snow, burying his pistol's muzzle. The gun went\noff, flinging itself like a rocket out of his hand. Winfree snatched it\nup. \"Blanks!\" he yelled, waving the .45. \"He was only going to shoot\nblanks.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThree more civilians, wearing the white-feather symbol on their\novercoats, advanced toward Winfree. Together, like partners in a ballet,\nthey bent to build snowballs, then stood and let fly. Winfree ducked,\nfound one of the dress sabers ignominiously sheathed in snow, and drew\nit out. He retreated toward the automobile, the saber raised to protect\nPeggy. \"Stand back,\" he shouted. \"I don't want to bloody-up this clean\nsnow.\"\n\nAnother mitrailleusade of snowballs connected, knocking off Winfree's\ncap and sending a shower of snow down his collar. The Headquarters\nbuilding was burning so well that it served as a warming bonfire to the\ntattered BSG personnel. A squad of civilian youngsters was chasing Major\nDampfer down the street, pelting the huge target of his backside with\nsnowballs.\n\nThe BSG Band-and-Glee-Club, covering their nakedness by pooling their\nrags, were a musical rabble. Kevin MacHenery, carrying a saber captured\nfrom one of the BSG-OCS-men, shouted to a tuba-player, the bell of whose\nhorn had been dimpled by a hard-cored snowball. \"Play the National\nAnthem,\" he yelled. The player, chilly and terrified, raised the\nmouthpiece of the tuba to his lips and, looking fearfully about like the\ntarget of a test-your-skill ball-throwing game, puffed out the sonorous\nopening notes. One by one the other players, a flute behind an elm tree,\na trumpet hidden in the back seat of a parked limousine, a snow-damaged\nsnare-drum, joined in; gravitating towards one another through the\nsuddenly quiet crowd. Winfree, like the other men, civil and BSG, stood\nat attention; but as he felt Peggy's arm slip through his he spoke out\nof the corner of his mouth. \"Get back to the car, Peggy,\" he said.\n\"Drive like hell out of this chivaree. I'll meet you at your dad's\nplace. Now git!\"\n\n\"You think maybe I had my fingers crossed when I promised to have and\nhold you?\" she asked. \"You're my man, Wes. If you get beat up, I want my\neyes blackened to match yours.\"\n\nThe anthem drew to a close just as a new instrument, the siren of a\nfiretruck, joined in. \"Stop that truck!\" one of the insurgent consumers\nshouted. \"Don't let 'em touch our fire.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe mob went back into action in two task-forces; one dedicated to the\nextirpation of the BSG-men currently available, the other clustered\naround the firetruck, thwarting the fire-fighters' efforts to couple\ntheir hose to the hydrant. One youngster, wearing the black leather\njacket and crash-helmet of a Potlatch Party, ran from the fireworks\nwarehouse with a thermite grenade. Pulling the pin, he tossed the\nsputtering bomb through a window of the burning building. \"Stop him!\"\nthe white-helmeted fire-chief shouted.\n\n\"Stop him, hell!\" a consumer replied. \"Man, we got a rebellion going.\nDon't you guys try to throw cold water on it unless you'd like to be\nsquirted solid ice with your own hose.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe fire-chief, his hands raised in despair, turned to his colleagues.\n\"Stand by, boys,\" he said. \"Nothing we can do till the cops get here to\nquell this bunch.\"\n\n\"Pretty, isn't it?\" one of the firemen remarked, dropping the canvas\nhose. \"We never get to see a building burn all the way. Think of all the\npapers in there, file-cabinets full of government regulations, lists of\nall our birthdays, quota-forms; all curling up and turning brown and\nreaching the kindling point. Nice fire, Chief.\"\n\nThe fire-chief faced Headquarters, a new look replacing his anxiety. \"It\nis kind of pretty,\" he admitted. He turned to the consumer ringleader.\n\"OK with you if we throw a little water on the fireworks warehouse?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"Sure,\" the man said. \"We don't want to blow up the old home-town; we\nonly want to put the BSG out of business.\" His band of consumers stepped\nback from the yellow fireplug to let the firemen hook up their hoses,\ntoggle on the pressure, and begin playing water over the blank face of\nthe fireworks warehouse.\n\nCaptain Winfree was buried in hard-fisted civilians, all seemingly\nintent on erasing him as the most familiar symbol of the Bureau of\nSeasonal Gratuities. Winfree bobbed to the surface of the maelstrom for\na moment, waving his saber, and shouted, \"MacHenery! Get these jokers\noff my back before I'm knee-deep in cold meat.\" He thwacked another of\nhis assailants across the pate with the flat of his blade.\n\nMacHenery, using his saber as a lever, pried himself a path through the\ncrowd. As he reached Captain Winfree, he raised his saber. The crowd\nabout the two men retreated. \"These folks have suffered a lot from you,\nCaptain,\" MacHenery said. \"Think maybe they're due to see a little\nbloodshed?\"\n\n\"OK by me,\" Winfree said, panting, \"if you don't mind shedding it.\" He\nraised his saber in salute--the only fencing-movement he'd become\nproficient in--and jumped into a crouch. MacHenery closed, and the two\nblades met in a clanging opening. Peggy's father, for all his handicap\nof twenty years, was a fencer; Winfree, in his maiden effort as a\nsabreur, used his weapon like a club. He allemanded about MacHenery, now\nand then dashing in with clumsy deliveries that were always met by the\nolder man's blade.\n\nThose firemen not immediately concerned with spraying the warehouse\nwall mounted the racks of their truck to watch the duel. BSG-men and\n-women, huddled close to the warmth of the burning building, watched\nunhappily as their champion was forced to retreat before MacHenery's\ntechnique. \"He'll kill him!\" Peggy shouted. She was restrained from\ntrying to break up the fight by two burly consumers.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWinfree, trying a gambit he'd seen in one of MacHenery's books but had\nnever before attempted, extended his saber and flew forward toward\nMacHenery in a fl\u00e8che. MacHenery caught Winfree's blade on his own and\ntossed it aside. He brought back his own weapon to sketch a line down\nthe Captain's right cheek. The scratch was pink for a moment, then it\nstarted to bleed heavily. The crowd shouted encouragement, the\nBSG-troops groaned. \"Keep cool, Wes,\" MacHenery whispered to his\nopponent as they dos-\u00e0-doed back into position. \"I have to make this\nlook fierce or they'll insist on lynching you.\"\n\n\"Don't make it look too good,\" Winfree panted. \"Cover yourself--I might\nhurt you out of sheer clumsiness.\" His chin and throat were covered with\nblood, now; blood enough to satisfy the most indignant consumer. The\nmoment the measure was set again, Winfree lunged, trying to slip his\nblade beneath MacHenery's guard to strike his arm. His foible met the\nflash of the other man's forte, and his blade bounced aside like a\nsprung bow.\n\nMacHenery slammed his saber into Winfree's, spinning the weapon out of\nhis hand into the crowd. He lunged then, delivering his point against\nWinfree's chest. Peggy, released from her captors, burst from the crowd\nto throw herself against her father. \"Stop it, Daddy!\" she pleaded,\n\"please stop!\"\n\nMacHenery raised his saber in salute. \"All right, Pocahontas,\" he said.\n\"Take your John Smith home and patch up that cut. It's no worse than\nwhat he gets shaving.\" He turned to the crowd, his saber still raised in\nsalute. \"Potlatch is over forever!\" he shouted.\n\nUrged by a delegation of music-loving consumers, the tubist raised his\nravaged horn. The other members of the BSG Band-and-Glee-Club gathered\nround him, all ragged, some with one eye closed by a purple fist-mark;\nand they began, on the tubist's signal, \"God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen.\"\nThe District Headquarters building, gutted, was glowing like an\nabandoned fireplace. The firemen joined the singing as they coiled their\nhoses. The Potlatch Riot was over.\n\nWinfree led his wife to their car. The _Just Married_ sign was still in\nplace, but the car's train of shoes and milk-cans had been ripped off to\nfurnish ammunition in the fight. \"Let's go home, Peggy,\" Winfree said.\n\"I yearn for a fireside and some privacy.\"\n\nKevin MacHenery spoke from the back seat. \"You deserve them, Wes,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"What are you doing here?\" Peggy demanded, twisting to face her father.\n\"After you cut up my Wes you should be ashamed to show us your face.\"\n\n\"I want to apologize for that unfortunate necessity,\" MacHenery said.\n\"But if I hadn't scratched him, Peggy-my-heart, the mob might have done\nmore radical surgery. I saw one consumer with a rope, trying different\nknots.\"\n\n\"Apology accepted,\" Winfree said. \"Now, if you don't mind, Mr.\nMacHenery, Peggy and I'd like to be alone.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" MacHenery said. \"First, though, I'd like to present you a\ndecoration to commemorate your part in this skirmish, Wes.\" He took the\nlittle white feather from his hatbrim and attached it to Winfree's\ntattered, blood-stained tunic.\n\n\"What's this for?\" Winfree asked.\n\n\"For services rendered the Rebellion,\" MacHenery said. \"I've often\nwondered why it's only the Tom Paines and the Jeffersons who get honored\nby successful rebels. There's many a revolution, Wesley, that would have\nfailed except for the dedicated tyranny of the men it overthrew.\"\n\n\"I don't understand, Daddy,\" Peggy protested.\n\n\"Wes will probably explain to you sometime how he brought this all on\nhimself,\" MacHenery said, opening his door to get out. \"Now I expect you\ntwo have other things to talk about. Thank you, Captain Winfree, for\nplaying so excellent a George the Third to our rebellion.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" Winfree said, raising his hand in salute. \"I wish you\na Merry, nine-letter Christmas.\"\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Science Fiction Stories_\n    September 1959.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
