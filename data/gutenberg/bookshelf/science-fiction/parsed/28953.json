Not all children perhaps, and not with\n    completely merciless regularity. But often enough to make us\n    shudder. Only Richard Lowe remains independent. The youngster of\n    this story isn't a child monster at all. He's just--a \"destructor.\"\n    And that in itself is somehow unimaginably terrifying!_\n\n\n when\n    i\n grow\n   up\n\n _by ... Richard E. Lowe_\n\n\n The two professors couldn't agree on the fundamentals of\n child behavior. But that was before they met little Herbux!\n\n\nThe University sprawled casually, unashamed of its disordered ranks,\nover a hundred thousand acres of grassy, rolling countryside. It was the\nyear A.D. 3896, and the vast assemblage of schools and colleges and\nlaboratories had been growing on this site for more than two thousand\nyears.\n\nIt had survived political and industrial revolutions, local\ninsurrections, global, inter-terrestrial and nuclear wars, and it had\nbecome the acknowledged center of learning for the entire known\nuniverse.\n\nNo subject was too small to escape attention at the University. None was\ntoo large to be attacked by the fearless, probing fingers of curiosity,\nor to in any way over-awe students and teachers in this great\ninstitution of learning.\n\nNo book was ever closed in the University and no clue, however tiny, was\ndiscarded as useless in the ceaseless search for knowledge which was the\nUniversity's prime and overriding goal.\n\nFor no matter how fast and far the spaceships might fly, or what strange\ncreatures might be brought back across the great curve of the universe\nor how deeply the past was resurrected or the future probed, of one\nthing only was the University quite sure--_man did not know enough_.\n\nAll manner of schools had come into being at the University, and often\nthey functioned in pairs, one devoted to proving a proposition, and the\nother to disproving it. And among these pairs of schools two, in\nparticular, seemed to exist on a most tenuous basis. Their avowed\nmission was to settle the age-old argument concerning the relative\ninfluences of heredity and environment.\n\nOne, headed by Professor Miltcheck von Possenfeller, worked tirelessly\nto prove that there was no such determining factor as heredity, and that\nenvironment alone was the governing influence in human behavior.\n\nThe other, under the direction of Dr. Arthur D. Smithlawn, was dedicated\nto the task of proving that environment meant nothing, and that only\nheredity was important.\n\nSuccess, in short, could only come to those who were born with the genes\nof success in their bodies, and failure was as preordained for the rest\nas was ultimate death for all.\n\nOver a period of more than two hundred years the School of Environment\nhad been taking babies from among the thousands of homeless waifs\ngathered in throughout the universe, and raising them carefully in a\nclosely supervised, cultural atmosphere.\n\nThe School of Heredity, on the other hand, was more select. Its pupils\ncame only from families whose genealogy could be traced back for at\nleast a thousand years. Freedom of choice and expression was the rule\nhere, since the school was attempting to prove that a child's inherited\ntendencies will send it inevitably along a predetermined path,\ncompletely uninfluenced by outside help or hindrance.\n\nIn two centuries neither school had been able to develop an overpowering\ncase in support of its own theory. Hence they both thrived, and\ncheerfully ignored the discrepancies which existed in the case records\nof individuals who had not turned out according to the book.\n\nAlthough they were zealous professional rivals, Prof. von Possenfeller\nand Dr. Smithlawn were devoted personal friends. They called each other\nPossy and Smithy and got together once a week to play chess and exchange\nviews on the universe in general. Only one subject was taboo between\nthem--their experimental work.\n\nOn this particular Saturday night, however, Smithy noticed that his good\nfriend Possy was terribly agitated and disturbed, and had for the third\ntime carelessly put his queen in jeopardy.\n\n\"My dear friend,\" exclaimed Possy, blindly moving his king into check.\n\"Could you possibly be persuaded to ignore for the moment our ban on\nprofessional talk? There is something--\"\n\nSmithy, secretly, was only too anxious to talk at great length. But he\npretended to give the request serious consideration.\n\n\"If it is really important,\" he said. \"Yes, by all means. Go right\nahead.\"\n\n\"Smithy,\" Possy plunged on, \"I am nonplussed. I am really, terribly\ndisturbed. I've never felt like this before.\"\n\nSmithy waited patiently while Possy poured himself a large brandy and\nsoda, hastily gulped it down, and made a face as he regretted the\naction.\n\n\"How much do you know about our methods of working in the School of\nEnvironment?\" the professor asked, taking a new tack.\n\n\"Nothing, of course,\" replied Smithy. The statement was not precisely\ntrue, but Smithy was not yet ready to confess that he had spies in his\nfriend's school.\n\n\"Well, then,\" said Possy, knowing full well that Smithy had been getting\nreports on his college for many years, and feeling secretly glad that\nhe, in turn, had been spying.\n\n\"Well, then,\" he repeated, \"you should be aware that we know _absolutely\nnothing_ about the children we enroll. Most of them are infants. We do\nnot know who their parents were, or where they were born. Except for the\nobvious clues which their bodies furnish, we do not even know their\nnational or racial origins.\n\n\"We bring them up with absolutely equal treatment--the finest of\neverything. At the age of five we divide them arbitrarily into classes\nand begin training them for occupations. Some we educate as scholars,\nsome laborers, some professional men. In me, dear friend, you see one of\nthe triumphs of our methods. I myself was a foundling--raised and\neducated in the School of Environment. Whatever I may be, I owe to the\nSchool.\"\n\nHe paused to give Smithy a chance to digest the statement.\n\n\"Of course,\" Possy continued, \"we take into consideration such factors\nas physical build and muscular development. We don't train undersized\nboys to be freight handlers. But in general the division is arbitrary.\nAnd you'd be amazed how they respond to it. To keep a check on things,\nwe interview our students twice a year to see how much they have\nlearned.\n\n\"We always ask them what they want to be when they grow up. That enables\nus to determine whether or not the training is really taking hold.\nOccasionally, it is true, we find a case where the schooling seems to\nrun counter to natural aptitudes--\"\n\nSmithy could not resist interrupting. \"Natural aptitudes? I am surprised\nto hear you use such an expression. I thought you furnished your\nstudents with aptitudes through environmental conditioning.\"\n\nStiffly, Possy retorted, \"Sometime we will have a full, objective\ndiscussion of the matter. It is not pertinent at this moment. Of course\nI believe in natural, or instinctive aptitudes. But I do not believe\nthat they are inherited from parents or even from remote ancestors.\"\n\n\"Cosmic rays, perhaps,\" needled Smithy, and became instantly sorry when\nhis friend's face began to redden. Possy didn't believe in cosmic rays,\nobviously. Smithy apologized.\n\nPossy sighed deeply and made a fresh start. \"My friend,\" he said, \"in\nyour work, as I understand it, you learn everything you can about a\nstudent's past--and about his progenitors. By so doing you hope to be\nable to predict his future abilities, his likes and dislikes. But what\ncourse do you pursue when you find a boy who just doesn't prove out\naccording to the prognostications?\"\n\nSmithy mumbled a few evasive words in reply, but refused to be drawn\ninto giving a positive answer.\n\n\"Never mind,\" Possy said. \"What would you say if you asked a boy what he\nliked, or what he wanted to do and his answer concerned something that\nnever existed, or had never been dreamed of? Something horrible.\"\n\nSmithy's eyebrows perked up. He made no attempt to conceal the fact that\nhis interest had been aroused.\n\n\"What, precisely, do you mean?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Just this,\" Possy said, leaning forward to give emphasis to his words.\n\"We have a boy who is being trained as a space navigator. He is very\nbright. He is of medium build, as a spaceman must be, and he learns\neasily and willingly. We are sure now that he will be ready for\npre-space school two years before he reaches the minimum age. Yet,\nwhenever this boy is asked what he wants to do, he replies, 'I want to\nbe a Destructor.'\"\n\nSmithy's lips parted. But for a moment he remained completely silent\nwhile his mind stumbled over the strange term.\n\n\"Destructor?\" he repeated, at last.\n\n\"Wait,\" said Possy, \"and listen carefully. This boy is now ten years\nold. He first gave me that answer three days ago. He repeated it two\ndays ago, then yesterday and again today. I had never interviewed him\nbefore. I never interview a student personally until the tenth year--so\nI quite naturally had his files double-checked. Smithy, he's been giving\nthe same answer ever since he was five years old. Two interviews a year\nfor six years--and three extra ones this week! Imagine! Fifteen times\nthis boy has said he wants to be a Destructor--and no one even knows\nwhat a Destructor is.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Smithy said with a shrug, convinced that Possy was getting all\nexcited over nothing, \"I admit it seems strange--and highly\nsingle-minded for so young a boy. But don't you imagine it's some word\nhe just made up?\"\n\n\"I admitted that as a possibility until this morning. But look here.\"\n\nPossy reached behind his chair and took up a small leather bag. Slowly\nhe unzipped it and delved inside. Then, with a grim flourish, he brought\nforth the body of a cat.\n\nAs Smithy's eyes widened, Possy said dramatically: \"Smithy, that boy\nkilled this cat with a _glance_.\"\n\n\"With a--a what?\"\n\n\"A glance! You heard me correctly. He just looked at the cat, and the\nbeast dropped dead. And he did it to other things, too--a sparrow, a\nbaby fox. Why, he even did it to a rat that had been cornered by this\nvery cat.\n\n\"I tell you, I had never been so shaken by anything in all my life. I\nsaid to myself, 'Possy, have you got yourself a mutant?' 'No,' I\nreplied. 'He's completely normal in every respect, physically and\notherwise. He's a bit brighter than average, perhaps--ninety-eight six\nin his studies, including elementary astrophysics. He speaks\nbrilliantly, composes poetry, even invents little gadgets. He's a\ngenius, maybe, but not a mutant.' Then I asked myself, 'how do you\naccount for the cat?'\"\n\nPossy paused, inferentially transferring the question to his friend.\n\n\"I can't account for the cat,\" Smithy said. \"Unless we assume its death\nwas a coincidence. But I confess you've aroused my curiosity. Could I\nsee and talk to this boy who wants to be a--\" he grimaced--\"a\nDestructor?\"\n\n\"I'm glad you asked.\" Possy sighed with relief. \"Actually he is outside\nnow, waiting to join us. But I must warn you that you'll find him quite\nprecocious. However, he's extremely amenable.\"\n\nPossy went quickly to the door, opened it and called, \"Herbux, come in.\"\n\nThe boy entered. He was, Smithy observed, a quite ordinary-looking boy.\nHe was so obviously ten years old that you couldn't say he was either\nold or young, large or small, fat or thin or anything else, \"for his\nage.\" He was just ten years old and a boy.\n\n\"Herbux,\" said Possy, \"I want you to meet a friend of mine--the famous\nDr. Smithlawn.\"\n\n\"How do you do, sir,\" Herbux said politely.\n\n\"How do _you_ do,\" returned Smithy. He had already decided not to be\npatronizing, but to take a bold, frank, comradely course with the lad.\n\n\"Herbux,\" he said, \"Professor von Possenfeller has been telling me the\nstory of your life. Now you tell me, Herbux. Not _what_ you want to be\nwhen you grow up, but _why_.\"\n\n\"I don't know why, sir,\" Herbux replied easily. \"I only know that I want\nto be a Destructor.\"\n\n\"But, Herbux, what _is_ a Destructor?\"\n\nHerbux looked around the room. He saw Smithy's birdcage, walked over to\nit and stared for a moment quietly at Dicky, the doctor's parakeet.\n\nDicky looked back, chirped angrily twice and toppled from his perch. He\nlanded on his back, his tiny feet rigid and unmoving. He was quite dead,\nSmithy observed, with a sudden, detached, unbelieving horror. Why, Dicky\nwas seven years old and he had been as good a pet as any lonely old\nprofessor could have desired as a cheery avian companion.\n\n\"Look here, young man,\" he began sternly. Then, as the shock passed, he\nhastily changed his tone. Suppose this child _did_ have some strange\nsort of power--mystic perhaps, but definitely abnormal. He may belong in\nthe School of the Future, Smithy thought. Or perhaps in the School of\nthe Past--the Dark Ages Department. But not here!\n\n\"Don't worry, sir,\" Herbux said. \"I can't do it to you.\"\n\n\"But--do _what_?\" Smithy cried. \"What did you do?\"\n\n\"I destructed.\"\n\nSmithy took a deep breath. He felt as though a cruel hoax had been\nplayed on him. After all, Possy could have lied about the cat and the\nother creatures. And the boy was quite obviously bright enough to learn\nlines and play a part. But how explain Dicky?\n\nHe tried to calculate the coincidental odds that might have caused Dicky\nto die a natural death at one precise instant in time under unusual and\nexact circumstances. They proved to be incalculable to his\nunmathematical brain. He rubbed his face with the palms of both hands.\nThen he turned abruptly to Possy.\n\n\"I just don't know what to say about it,\" he explained. \"How _could_ I\nknow? How could anybody know?\"\n\nHe faced the boy again. \"Look here, Herbux. This--this power of yours.\nWhen did you first notice you had it?\"\n\n\"Last year, sir. I always knew I would do it sometime. But one day I was\nlooking at a bird perched on my windowsill, and it fell over dead, just\nas your parakeet did. I thought it was an accident or a coincidence. But\nthen the next day it happened again--with a squirrel. Soon I got to\nwhere I could do it on purpose. But I don't know how.\"\n\n\"Well, how do you _feel_ about it? Do you _want_ to kill these harmless\npets?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, sir. I don't want to _kill_ them. I just want to be a\nDestructor.\"\n\nSmithy had a sudden, disquieting conviction that he was in the presence\nof some completely alien, dangerous being. A cold breeze seemed to\nshiver through the room, though he knew that his quarters were airtight\nand perfectly ventilated. _This is ridiculous_, he told himself,\nturning to Possy with a helpless shrug. To feel like this over such a\nnice-looking young lad ...\n\n\"My friend,\" he said, \"all this has occurred so suddenly I must have\ntime to think. Such a thing could never have happened in _my_ school.\nPerhaps you should--but doubtless it has already occurred to you--turn\nhim over to physio-psychological rebuilding?\"\n\nPossy nodded. \"It has, of course. But then I said to myself, 'Possy,\nthey are a bunch of dunderheaded old fossils over there. They can take a\ncriminal and tear him apart and make a good citizen out of him, granted.\nBut do they find out _why_ he was a criminal? Have they reduced the\nnumber of new criminals? No. And they would not find out why this boy\nwants to be a Destructor--nor even what a Destructor is.'\n\n\"'You're right,' I told myself. 'And besides, Herbux is a nice boy. Why,\nwith this power of his--if he _wanted_ to do harm--there wouldn't be an\nanimal left alive around the whole University. And if he could do it to\npeople he's had many an opportunity to practice on me. But has he? No,\nnot once. Besides, if you keep him in school, you can maintain a good\nclose watch over him. Herbux has promised to keep me fully informed as\nto the progress of his strange power. If he feels it getting stronger,\nhe will let me know immediately.' Isn't that right, Herbux?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said the boy quietly.\n\n\"You are quite sure,\" Smithy asked, \"that you know absolutely nothing\nabout this boy's past? His parents, his birthplace--anything at all?\nThere must be _some_ clue.\"\n\n\"You know very well I don't,\" Possy retorted angrily.\n\n\"I just thought that perhaps you might have subjected him to\nhypno-research,\" Smithy said, placatingly.\n\n\"I wouldn't dream of such a thing--\" Possy began--and stopped with a\ngasp. \"How did you know about that?\" he demanded.\n\nSmithy was flustered. \"I--well, that is--\" He could think of no\nconvincing answer. Hypno-research was one of Possy's most secret\nprojects. He had used it constantly in his efforts to determine reasons\nfor non-conformity to set patterns of behavior in some of his more\nrecalcitrant students. He had kept it a secret because it added up to an\nadmission that perhaps heredity could play a part in the development of\na student's character.\n\n\"Smithy, my dear old friend,\" he said with mock humility. \"This is no\ntime for us to quarrel. Let us face the facts candidly. You have been\nspying on my school--and I in turn have been spying on yours. I know,\nfor instance, that when your students don't behave the way their\nheredity charts predict you often use hypno-therapy to change their\nthought-lines, and force them to conform. Is that any less fair than\nwhat I do?\"\n\nSmithy sighed. \"I guess not, my friend. No, wait. I will go farther than\nthat. It is not a matter of guessing. I am quite certain about it. We\nare a couple of aging frauds, struggling selfishly along, playing with\nthe lives of these children solely to keep our jobs. Perhaps we\nshould--\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, we have a problem,\" interrupted Possy. \"It's a problem\nthat won't be solved by our becoming senile idiots. Get your mind back\non Herbux, and help me. I feel this is a most desperate situation. If it\ngets beyond just the two of us, we are likely to be thoroughly\ninvestigated. Then goodness knows what would happen.\"\n\n\"But why? The child can do no real harm. Suppose he does 'destruct' an\nanimal or two? There are plenty more. And sooner or later they would die\nof natural causes, anyway. And it's unthinkable that he could ever do it\nto--to people ...\"\n\nSmithy paused, obviously struck by a startling thought. He turned to\nHerbux. \"Boy,\" he said, quite sternly. \"Come here.\"\n\nHerbux obeyed, advancing to within a foot of the old doctor and facing\nhim squarely.\n\n\"Look me in the eyes,\" Smithy commanded.\n\nQuestioningly, Herbux began to stare at Smithy.\n\n\"Well,\" Smithy said, after a time, \"turn it on.\"\n\nA set look came over Herbux's face. His lips were compressed and a thin\ndew of sweat had broken out on his forehead.\n\nPossy stood aghast, slowly comprehending what his old friend Smithy was\ndoing. He was actually risking his life--or so he believed--to prove\nthat the child could not destruct a human being. He wanted to stop the\nboy, but he could not move from where he stood.\n\nSuddenly Herbux broke and turned away. He began to sob.\n\n\"It's no use!\" he cried. \"I can't do it. I just can't do it ...\"\n\nSmithy went to him and put an arm on his shoulders.\n\n\"Tell me, boy,\" he exclaimed. \"What do you mean? Do you mean that you\ncan't _bring yourself_ to do it, or that it is physically impossible?\"\n\nHerbux just stood there, his head bowed, crying wildly.\n\n\"I just can't do it,\" he repeated, sounding now completely heart-broken.\n\nPossy, coming alive again, said soothingly, \"Don't cry, son. It's not\nbad. It's good, that you can't do it.\"\n\nHerbux whirled around, facing Possy, his face inflamed with a sudden\nrage.\n\n\"But I will,\" he screamed, \"I will do it! I will! _When I grow up!_\"\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ September 1956.\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
