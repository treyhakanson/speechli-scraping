He could detect the flaws in\nany scheme almost on sight--even where they had eluded the best brains\nin the ad agency where he worked. So when the Chief of World Security\ntold him that he had been selected as the answer to the Solar System's\ngreatest mystery, Jery assumed that it was because of his mental\nagility.\n\nBut when he got to Mars to find out why fifteen boys had vanished from\na spaceship in mid-space, he found out that even his quick mind needed\ntime to pierce the maze of out-of-this-world double-dealing. For Jery\nhad become a walking bomb, and when he set himself off, it would be the\nend of the whole puzzle of THE SECRET MARTIANS--with Jery as the first\nto go!\n\nJack Sharkey decided to be a writer nineteen years ago, in the Fourth\nGrade, when he realized all at once that \"someone wrote all those\nstories in the textbooks.\" While everyone else looked forward variously\nto becoming firemen, cowboys, and trapeze artists, Jack was devouring\nevery book he could get his hands on, figuring that \"if I put enough\nliterature into my head, some of it might overflow and come out.\"\n\nAfter sixteen years of education, Jack found himself teaching high\nschool English in Chicago, a worthwhile career, but \"not what one would\ncall zesty.\" After a two-year Army hitch, and a year in advertising\n\"sublimating my urge to write things for cash,\" Jack moved to New York,\ndetermined to make a career of full-time fiction-writing.\n\nOddly enough, it worked out, and he now does nothing else. He says,\n\"I'd like to say I do this for fulfillment, or for cash, or because\nit's my destiny; however, the real reason (same as that expressed by\nJean Kerr) is that this kind of stay-at-home self-employment lets me\nsleep late in the morning.\"\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nI was sitting at my desk, trying to decide how to tell the women of\nAmerica that they were certain to be lovely in a Plasti-Flex brassiere\nwithout absolutely guaranteeing them anything, when the two security\nmen came to get me. I didn't quite believe it at first, when I looked\nup and saw them, six-feet-plus of steel nerves and gimlet eyes, staring\ndown at me, amidst my litter of sketches, crumpled copy sheets and\ndeadline memos.\n\nIt was only a fraction of an instant between the time I saw them and\nthe time they spoke to me, but in that miniscule interval I managed\nto retrace quite a bit of my lifetime up till that moment, seeking\nvainly for some reason why they'd be standing there, so terribly and\ninflexibly efficient looking. Mostly, I ran back over all the ads I'd\ncreated and/or okayed for Solar Sales, Inc. during my five years with\nthe firm, trying to see just where I'd gone and shaken the security\nof the government. I couldn't find anything really incriminating,\nunless maybe it was that hair dye that unexpectedly turned bright green\nafter six weeks in the hair, but that was the lab's fault, not mine.\nSo I managed a weak smile toward the duo, and tried not to sweat too\nprofusely.\n\n\"Jery Delvin?\" said the one on my left, a note of no-funny-business in\nhis brusque baritone.\n\n\"... Yes,\" I said, some terrified portion of my mind waiting\nmasochistically for them to draw their collapsers and reduce me to a\nheap of hot protons.\n\n\"Come with us,\" said his companion. I stared at him, then glanced\nhopelessly at the jumble of things on my desk. \"Never mind that stuff,\"\nhe added.\n\nI rose from my place, slipped my jacket from its hook, and started\nacross the office toward the door, each of them falling into rigid step\nbeside me. Marge, my secretary, stood wide-eyed as we passed through\nher office, heading for the hall exit.\n\n\"Mr. Delvin,\" she said, her voice a wispy croak. \"When will you be\nback? The Plasti-Flex man is waiting for your--\"\n\nI opened my mouth, but one of the security men cut in.\n\n\"You will be informed,\" he said to Marge.\n\nShe was staring after me, open-mouthed, as the door slid neatly shut\nbehind us.\n\n\"_W-Will_ I be back?\" I asked desperately, as we waited for the\nelevator. \"At all? Am I under arrest? What's up, anyhow?\"\n\n\"You will be informed,\" said the man again. I had to let it go at that.\nSecurity men were not hired for their loquaciousness. They had a car\nwaiting at the curb downstairs, in the No Parking zone. The cop on the\nbeat very politely opened the door for them when we got there. Those\nred-and-bronze uniforms carry an awful lot of weight. Not to mention\nthe golden bulk of their holstered collapsers.\n\nThere was nothing for me to do but sweat it out and to try and enjoy\nthe ride, wherever we were going.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"_You_ are Jery Delvin?\"\n\nThe man who spoke seemed more than surprised; he seemed stunned. His\nvoice held an incredulous squeak, a squeak which would have amazed his\nsubordinates. It certainly amazed me. Because the speaker was Philip\nBaxter, Chief of Interplanetary Security, second only to the World\nPresident in power, and not even that in matters of security. I managed\nto nod.\n\nHe shook his white-maned head, slowly. \"I don't believe it.\"\n\n\"But I am, sir,\" I insisted doggedly.\n\nBaxter pressed the heels of his hands against his eyes for a moment,\nthen sighed, grinned wryly, and waggled an index finger at an empty\nplastic contour chair.\n\n\"I guess maybe you are at that, son. Sit down, sit down.\"\n\nI folded gingerly at knees and hips and slid back into the chair,\npressing my perspiring palms against the sides of my pants to get rid\nof their uncomfortably slippery feel. \"Thank you, sir.\"\n\nThere was a silence, during which I breathed uneasily, and a bit too\nloudly. Baxter seemed to be trying to say something.\n\n\"I suppose you're wondering why I've called--\" he started, then stopped\nshort and flushed with embarrassment. I felt a sympathetic hot wave\nflooding my own features. A copy chief in an advertising company almost\nalways reacts to an obvious cliche.\n\nThen, with something like a look of relief on his blunt face, he\nsnatched up a brochure from his kidney-shaped desktop and his eyes\nraced over the lettering on its face.\n\n\"Jery Delvin,\" he read, musingly and dispassionately. \"Five foot eleven\ninches tall, brown hair, slate-gray eyes. Citizen. Honest, sober,\ncivic-minded, slightly antisocial....\"\n\nHe looked at me, questioningly.\n\n\"I'd rather not discuss that, sir, if you don't mind.\"\n\n\"Do you mind if I do mind?\"\n\n\"Oh ... Oh, well if you put it like that. It's girls, sir. They block\nmy mind. Ruin my work.\"\n\n\"I don't get you.\"\n\n\"Well, in my job--See, I've got this gift. I'm a spotter.\"\n\n\"A what?\"\n\n\"A spotter. I can't be fooled. By advertising. Or mostly anything else.\nExcept girls.\"\n\n\"I'm still not sure that I--\"\n\n\"It's like this. I designate ratios, by the minute. They hand me a new\nad, and I read it by a stopwatch. Then, as soon as I spot the clinker,\nthey stop the watch. If I get it in five seconds, it passes. But if I\nspot it in less, they throw it out and start over again. Or is that\nclear? No, I guess you're still confused, sir.\"\n\n\"Just a bit,\" Baxter said.\n\nI took a deep breath and tried again.\n\n\"Maybe an example would be better. Uh, you know the one about 'Three\nout of five New York lawyers use Hamilton Bond Paper for note-taking'?\"\n\n\"I've heard that, yes.\"\n\n\"Well, the clinker--that's the sneaky part of the ad, sir, or what we\ncall weasel-wording--the clinker in that one is that while it seems to\nimply sixty percent of New York lawyers, it actually means precisely\nwhat it says: Three out of five. For that particular product, we had\nto question seventy-nine lawyers before we could come up with three who\nliked Hamilton Bond, see? Then we took the names of the three, and the\nnames of two of the seventy-six men remaining, and kept them on file.\"\n\n\"On file?\" Baxter frowned. \"What for?\"\n\n\"In case the Federal Trade Council got on our necks. We could prove\nthat three out of five lawyers used the product. Three out of those\nfive. See?\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Baxter, grinning. \"I begin to. And your job is to test these\nads, before they reach the public. What fools you for five seconds will\nfool the average consumer indefinitely.\"\n\nI sat back, feeling much better. \"That's right, sir.\"\n\nThen Baxter frowned again. \"But what's this about girls?\"\n\n\"They--they block my thinking, sir, that's all. Why, take that example\nI just mentioned. In plain writing, I caught the clinker in one-tenth\nof a second. Then they handed me a layout with a picture of a lawyer\ndictating notes to his secretary on it. Her legs were crossed. Nice\nlegs. Gorgeous legs....\"\n\n\"How long that time, Delvin?\"\n\n\"Indefinite. Till they took the girl away, sir.\"\n\nBaxter cleared his throat loudly. \"I understand, at last. Hence your\nslight antisocial rating. You avoid women in order to keep your job.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Even my secretary, Marge, whom I'd never in a million years\nthink of looking at twice, except for business reasons, of course, has\nto stay out of my office when I'm working, or I can't function.\"\n\n\"You have my sympathy, son,\" Baxter said, not unkindly.\n\n\"Thank you, sir. It hasn't been easy.\"\n\n\"No, I don't imagine it has....\" Baxter was staring into some far-off\ndistance. Then he remembered himself and blinked back to the present.\n\"Delvin,\" he said sharply. \"I'll come right to the point. This thing\nis.... You have been chosen for an extremely important mission.\"\n\nI couldn't have been more surprised had he announced my incipient\nmaternity, but I was able to ask, \"Me? For Pete's sake, why, sir?\"\n\nBaxter looked me square in the eye. \"Damned if I know!\"\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nI stared at him, nonplussed. He'd spoken with evidence of utmost\ncandor, and the Chief of Interplanetary Security was not one to be\naccused of a friendly josh, but--\"You're kidding!\" I said. \"You must\nbe. Otherwise, why was I sent for?\"\n\n\"Believe me, I wish I knew,\" he sighed. \"You were chosen, from all\nthe inhabitants of this planet, and all the inhabitants of the Earth\nColonies, by the Brain.\"\n\n\"You mean that International Cybernetics picked me for a mission?\nThat's crazy, if you'll pardon me, sir.\"\n\nBaxter shrugged, and his genial smile was a bit tightly stretched.\n\"When the current emergency arose and all our usual methods failed, we\nhad to submit the problem to the Brain.\"\n\n\"And,\" I said, beginning to be fascinated by his bewildered manner,\n\"what came out?\"\n\nHe looked at me for a long moment, then picked up that brochure again,\nand said, without referring to it, \"Jery Delvin, five foot eleven\ninches tall--\"\n\n\"Yes, but read me the part where it says why I was picked,\" I said, a\nlittle exasperated.\n\nBaxter eyed me balefully, then skimmed the brochure through the air in\nmy direction. I caught it just short of the carpet.\n\n\"If you can find it, I'll read it!\" he said, almost snarling.\n\nI looked over the sheet, then turned it over and scanned the black\nopposite side. \"All it gives is my description, governmental status,\nand address!\"\n\n\"Uh-huh,\" Baxter grunted laconically. \"It amuses you, does it?\" The\nsmile was still on his lips, but there was a grimness in the glitter of\nhis narrowing eyes.\n\n\"Not really,\" I said hastily. \"It baffles me, to be frank.\"\n\n\"If you're sitting there in that hopeful stance awaiting some sort of\nexplanation, you may as well relax,\" Baxter said shortly. \"I have none\nto make. IC had none to make. Damn it all to hell!\" He brought a meaty\nfist down on the desktop. \"No one has an explanation! All we know is\nthat the Brain always picks the right man.\"\n\nI let this sink in, then asked, \"What made you ask for a man in\nthe first place, sir? I've always understood that your own staff\nrepresented some of the finest minds--\"\n\n\"Hold it, son. Perhaps I didn't make myself clear. We asked for no man.\nWe asked for a solution to an important problem. And your name was what\nwe got. You, son, are the solution.\"\n\nChief of Security or not, I was getting a little burned up at his\nhighhanded treatment of my emotions. \"How nice!\" I said icily. \"Now if\nI only knew the problem!\"\n\nBaxter blinked, then lost some of his scowl. \"Yes, of course;\" Baxter\nmurmured, lighting up a cigar. He blew a plume of blue smoke toward the\nceiling, then continued. \"You've heard, of course, of the Space Scouts?\"\n\nI nodded. \"Like the old-time Boy Scouts, only with rocket-names for\ntheir various troops in place of the old animal names.\"\n\n\"And you recall the recent government-sponsored trip they had? To Mars\nand back, with the broadly-smiling government picking up the enormous\ntab?\"\n\nI detected a tinge of cynicism in his tone, but said nothing.\n\n\"What a gesture!\" Baxter went on, hardly speaking directly to me at\nall. \"Inter-nation harmony! Good will! If these mere boys can get\ntogether and travel the voids of space, then so can everyone else! Why\nshould there be tensions between the various nations comprising the\nWorld Government, when there's none between these fine lads, one from\nevery civilized nation on Earth?\"\n\n\"You sound disillusioned, sir,\" I interjected.\n\nHe stared at me as though I'd just fallen in from the ceiling or\nsomewhere. \"Huh? Oh, yes, Delvin, isn't it? Sorry, I got carried away.\nWhere was I?\"\n\n\"You were telling about how this gesture, the WG sending these kids\noff for an extraterrestrial romp, will cement relations between those\nnations who have remained hostile despite the unification of all\ngovernments on Earth. Personally, I think it was a pretty good idea,\nmyself. Everybody likes kids. Take this jam we were trying to push.\nPomegranate Nectar, it was called. Well, sir, it just wouldn't sell,\nand then we got this red-headed kid with freckles like confetti all\nover his slightly bucktoothed face, and we--Sir?\"\n\nI'd paused, because he was staring at me like a man on the brink of\napoplexy. I swallowed, and tried to look relaxed.\n\nAfter a moment, he found his voice. \"To go on, Delvin. Do you recall\nwhat happened to the Space Scouts last week?\"\n\nI thought a second, then nodded. \"They've been having such a good time\nthat the government extended their trip by--Why are you shaking your\nhead that way, sir?\"\n\n\"Because it's not true, Delvin,\" he said. His voice was suddenly old\nand tired, and very much in keeping with his snowy hair. \"You see, the\nSpace Scouts have vanished.\"\n\nI came up in the chair, ramrod-straight. \"Their mothers--they've been\ngetting letters and--\"\n\n\"Forgeries, Fakes. Counterfeits.\"\n\n\"You mean whoever took the Scouts is falsifying--\"\n\n\"No. _My_ men are doing the work. Handpicked crews, day and night,\nhave been sending those letters to the trusting mothers. It's been\nghastly, Delvin. Hard on the men, terribly hard. Undotted _i_'s,\nmisuse of tenses, deliberate misspellings. They take it out of an\nadult, especially an adult with a mind keen enough to get him into\nInterplanetary Security. We've limited the shifts to four hours per man\nper day. Otherwise, they'd all be gibbering by now!\"\n\n\"And your men haven't found out anything?\" I marvelled.\n\nBaxter shook his head.\n\n\"And you finally had to resort to the Brain, and it gave you my name,\nbut no reason for it?\"\n\nBaxter cupped his slightly jowled cheeks in his hands and propped his\nelbows on the desktop, suddenly slipping out of his high position to\ntalk to me man-to-man. \"Look, son, an adding machine--which is a minor\nform of an electronic brain, and even works on the same principle--can\ntell you that two and two make four. But can it tell you why?\n\n\"Well, no, but--\"\n\n\"That, in a nutshell is our problem. We coded and fed to the Brain\nevery shred of information at our disposal; the ages of the children,\nfor instance, and all their physical attributes, and where they were\nlast seen, and what they were wearing. Hell, everything! The machine\ntook the factors, weighed them, popped them through its billions of\nrelays and tubes, and out of the end of the answer slot popped a single\nsheet. The one you just saw. Your dossier.\"\n\n\"Then I'm to be sent to Mars?\" I said, nervously.\n\n\"That's just it,\" Baxter sighed. \"We don't even know that! We're like a\nsavage who finds a pistol: used correctly, it's a mean little weapon;\npointed the wrong way, it's a quick suicide. So, you are our weapon.\nNow, the question is: Which way do we point you?\"\n\n\"You got me!\" I shrugged hopelessly.\n\n\"However, since we have nothing else to go on but the locale from which\nthe children vanished, my suggestion would be to send you there.\"\n\n\"Mars, you mean,\" I said.\n\n\"No, to the spaceship _Phobos II_. The one they were returning to Earth\nin when they disappeared.\"\n\n\"They disappeared from a spaceship? While in space?\"\n\nBaxter nodded.\n\n\"But that's impossible,\" I said, shaking my head against this\ndisconcerting thought.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Baxter. \"That's what bothers me.\"\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n_Phobos II_, for obvious reasons, was berthed in a Top Security\nspaceport. Even so, they'd shuttled it into a hangar, safe from the\neyes of even their own men, and as a final touch had hidden the ship's\nnameplate beneath magnetic repair-plates.\n\nI had a metal disk--bronze and red, the Security colors--insigniaed\nby Baxter and counterembossed with the President's special device, a\nsmall globe surmounted by clasping hands. It gave me authority to do\nanything. With such an identification disc, I could go to Times Square\nand start machine gunning the passers-by, and not one of New York's\nfinest would raise a hand to stop me.\n\nAnd, snugly enholstered, I carried a collapser, the restricted weapon\ngiven only to Security Agents, so deadly was its molecule-disrupting\nbeam. Baxter had spent a tremulous hour showing me how to use the\nweapon, and especially how to turn the beam off. I'd finally gotten the\nhang of it, though not before half his kidney-shaped desk had flashed\ninto nothingness, along with a good-sized swath of carpeting and six\ninches of concrete floor.\n\nHis parting injunction had been. \"Be careful, Delvin, huh?\"\n\nYes, parting. I was on my own. After all, with a Security disc--the\nAmnesty, they called it--such as I possessed, and a collapser, I could\ngo anywhere, do anything, commandeer anything I might need. All with\nno questions asked. Needless to say, I was feeling pretty chipper as I\nentered the hangar housing _Phobos II_. At the moment, I was the most\ninfluential human being in the known universe.\n\nThe pilot, as per my videophoned request, was waiting there for me. I\nsaw him as I stepped into the cool shadows of the building from the hot\nyellow sunlight outside. He was tall, much taller than I, but he seemed\nnervous as hell. At least he was pacing back and forth amid a litter\nof half-smoked cigarette butts beside the gleaming tailfins of the\nspaceship, and a fuming butt was puckered into place in his mouth.\n\n\"Anders?\" I said, approaching to within five feet of him before\nhalting, to get the best psychological effect from my appearance.\n\nHe turned, saw me, and hurriedly spat the butt out onto the cement\nfloor. \"Yes, sir!\" he said loudly, throwing me a quivering salute. His\neyes were a bit wild as they took me in.\n\nAnd well they might be. An Amnesty-bearer can suddenly decide a subject\nis not answering questions to his satisfaction and simply blast the\nannoying party to atoms. It makes for straight responses. Of course,\nI was dressing the part, in a way. I wore the Amnesty suspended by a\nthin golden chain from my neck, and for costume I wore a raven-black\nblouse and matching uniform trousers and boots. I must have looked\nquite sinister. I'm under six feet, but I'm angular and wiry. Thus,\nin ominous black, with an Amnesty on my breast and a collapser in\nmy holster, I was a sight to strike even honest citizens into quick\nexaminations of conscience. I felt a little silly, but the outfit was\nBaxter's idea.\n\n\"I understand you were aboard the _Phobos II_ when the incident\noccurred?\" I said sternly, which was unusual for my wonted demeanor.\n\n\"Yes, sir!\" he replied swiftly, at stiff attention.\n\n\"I don't really have any details,\" I said, and waited for him to take\nhis cue. As an afterthought, to help him talk, I added, \"At ease, by\nthe way, Anders.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" he said, not actually loosening much in his rigid\nposition, but his face looking happier. \"See, I was supposed to pilot\nthe kids back here from Mars when their trip was done, and--\" He gave\na helpless shrug. \"I dunno, sir. I got 'em all aboard, made sure they\nwere secure in the takeoff racks, and then I set my coordinates for\nEarth and took off. Just a run-of-the-mill takeoff, sir.\"\n\n\"And when did you notice they were missing?\" I asked, looking at the\nmetallic bulk of the ship and wondering what alien force could snatch\nfifteen fair-sized young boys through its impervious hull without\nleaving a trace.\n\n\"Chow time, sir. That's when you expect to have the little--to have\nthe kids in your hair, sir. Everyone wants his rations first--You know\nhow kids are, sir. So I went to the galley and was about to open up\nthe ration packs, when I noticed how damned quiet it was aboard. And\nespecially funny that no one was in the galley waiting for me to start\npassing the stuff out.\"\n\n\"So you searched,\" I said.\n\nAnders nodded sorrowfully. \"Not a trace of 'em, sir. Just some of their\njunk left in their storage lockers.\"\n\nI raised my eyebrows. \"Really? I'd be interested in seeing this junk,\nAnders.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, sir. Right this way, sir. Watch out for these rungs, they're\nslippery.\"\n\nI ascended the retractable metal rungs that jutted from a point\nbetween the tailfins to the open airlock, twenty feet over ground\nlevel, and followed Anders inside the ship.\n\nI trailed Anders through the ship, from the pilot's compartment--a\nbewildering mass of dials, switches, signal lights and wire--through\nthe galley into the troop section. It was a cramped cubicle housing a\nnumber of nylon-webbed foam rubber bunks. The bunks were empty, but I\nlooked them over anyhow. I carefully tugged back the canvas covering\nthat fitted envelope-fashion over a foam rubber pad, and ran my finger\nover the surface of the pad. It came away just slightly gritty.\n\n\"Uh-huh!\" I said, smiling. Anders just stared at me.\n\nI turned to the storage lockers. \"Let's see this junk they were\nsuddenly deprived of.\"\n\nAnders, after a puzzled frown, obediently threw open the doors of\nthe riveted tiers of metal boxes along the rear wall; the wall next\nto the firing chambers, which I had no particular desire to visit. I\nglanced inside at the articles therein, and noted with interest their\nsimilarity.\n\n\"Now, then,\" I resumed, \"the thrust of this rocket to get from Mars to\nEarth is calculated with regard to the mass on board, is that correct?\"\nHe nodded. \"Good, that clears up an important point. I'd also like to\nknow if this rocket has a dehumidifying system to keep the cast-off\nmoisture from the passengers out of the air?\"\n\n\"Well, sure, sir!\" said Anders. \"Otherwise, we'd all be swimming in our\nown sweat after a ten-hour trip across space!\"\n\n\"Have you checked the storage tanks?\" I asked. \"Or is the cast-off\nperspiration simply jetted into space?\"\n\n\"No. It's saved, sir. It gets distilled and stored for washing and\ndrinking. Otherwise, we'd all dehydrate, with no water to replace the\nwater we lost.\"\n\n\"Check the tanks,\" I said.\n\nAnders, shaking his head, moved into the pilot's section and looked at\na dial there. \"Full, sir. But that's because I didn't drink very much,\nand any sweating I did--which was a hell of a lot, in this case--was a\nsource of new water for the tanks.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh.\" I paused and considered. \"I suppose the tubing for these\ntanks is all over the ship? In all the hollow bulkhead space, to take\nup the moisture fast?\"\n\nAnders, hopelessly lost, could only nod wearily.\n\n\"Would it hold--\" I did some quick mental arithmetic--\"let's say, about\ntwenty-four extra cubic feet?\"\n\nHe stared, then frowned, and thought hard. \"Yes, sir,\" he said,\nafter a minute. \"Even twice that, with no trouble, but--\" He caught\nhimself short. It didn't pay to be too curious about the aims of an\nAmnesty-bearer.\n\n\"It's all right, Anders. You've been a tremendous help. Just one thing.\nWhen you left Mars, you took off from the night side, didn't you?\"\n\n\"Why, yes, I did, sir. But how did you--?\"\n\n\"No matter, Anders. That'll be all.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\" He saluted sharply and started off.\n\nI started back for Interplanetary Security, and my second--and I hoped,\nlast--interview with Chief Baxter. I had a slight inkling why the Brain\nhad chosen me; because, in the affair of the missing Space Scouts, my\ninfallible talent for spotting the True within the Apparent had come\nthrough nicely. I had found a very interesting clinker.\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\"Strange,\" I remarked to Chief Baxter when I was seated once again in\nhis office, opposite his newly replaced desk. \"I hardly acted like\nmyself out at that airfield. I was brusque, highhanded, austere, almost\nmalevolent with the pilot. And I'm ordinarily on the shy side, as a\nmatter of fact.\"\n\n\"It's the Amnesty that does it,\" he said, gesturing toward the disc. It\nlay on his desk, now, along with the collapser. I felt, with the new\ninformation I'd garnered, that my work was done, and that the new data\nfed into the Brain would produce some other results, not involving me.\n\nI looked at the Amnesty, then nodded. \"Kind of gets you, after awhile.\nTo know that you are the most influential person in creation is to\nautomatically act the part. A shame, in a way.\"\n\n\"The hell it is!\" Baxter snapped. \"Good grief, man, why'd you think the\nAmnesty was created in the first place?\"\n\nI sat up straight and scratched the back of my head. \"Now you mention\nit, I really don't know. It seems a pretty dangerous thing to have\nabout, the way people jump when they see it.\"\n\n\"It is dangerous, of course, but it's vitally necessary. You're young,\nJery Delvin, and even the finest history course available these days\nis slanted in favor of World Government. So you have no idea how tough\nthings were before the Amnesty came along. Ever hear of red tape?\"\n\nI shook my head. \"No, I don't believe so. Unless it had something to do\nwith the former communist menace? They called themselves the Reds, I\nbelieve....\"\n\nHe waved me silent. \"No connection at all, son. No, red tape was, well,\ninvolvement. Forms to be signed, certain factors to be considered,\nprotocol to be dealt with, government agencies to be checked with,\nclassifications, bureaus, sub-bureaus, congressional committees. It\nwas impossible, Jery, my boy, to get anything done whatsoever without\nconsulting someone else. And the time lag and paperwork involved made\naccurate and swift action impossible, sometimes. What we needed, of\ncourse, was a person who could simply have all authority, in order to\nsave the sometimes disastrous delays. So we came up with the Amnesty.\"\n\n\"But the danger. If you should pick the wrong man--\"\n\nBaxter smiled. \"No chance of that, Jery. We didn't leave it up to any\ncommittee or bureau or any other faction to do the picking. Hell, that\nwould have put us right back where we'd been before. No, we left it up\nto the Brain. We'd find ourselves in a tight situation, and the Brain\nafter being fed the data, would come up with either a solution, or a\nname.\"\n\nI stared at him. \"Then, when I was here before, I was here solely to\nreceive the Amnesty, is that it?\"\n\nBaxter nodded. \"The Brain just picks the men. Then we tell the men the\nsituation, hand over the Amnesty, and pray.\"\n\nI had a sudden thought. \"Say, what happens if two men are selected by\nthe Brain? Who has authority over whom?\"\n\nBaxter grimaced and shivered. \"Don't even think such a thing! Even\nyour mentioning such a contingency gives me a small migraine. It'd be\nunprecedented in the history of the Brain or the Amnesty.\" He grinned,\nsuddenly. \"Besides, it can't happen. There's only one of these--\" he\ntapped the medallion gently \"--in existence, Jery. So we couldn't have\nsuch a situation!\"\n\nI sank back into the contour chair, and glanced at my watch. Much too\nlate to go back to work. I'd done a lot in one day, I reasoned. Well,\nthe thing was out of my hands. Baxter had the information I'd come\nup with, and it had been coded and fed to the Brain. As soon as the\nsolution came through, I could be on my way back to the world of hard\nand soft sell.\n\n\"You understand,\" said Baxter suddenly, \"that you're to say nothing\nwhatever about the disappearance of the Space Scouts until this office\nmakes the news public? You know what would happen if this thing should\nleak!\"\n\nThe intercom on Baxter's desk suddenly buzzed, and a bright red light\nflashed on. \"Ah!\" he said, thumbing a knob. \"Here we go, at last!\"\n\nAs he exerted pressure on the knob, a thin slit in the side of the\nintercom began feeding out a long sheet of paper; the new answer from\nthe Brain. It reached a certain length, then was automatically sheared\noff within the intercom, and the sheet fell gently to the desktop.\nBaxter picked it up and swiftly scanned its surface. A look of dismay\noverrode his erstwhile genial features.\n\nI had a horrible suspicion. \"Not again?\" I said softly.\n\nBaxter swore under his breath. Then he reached across the desktop and\ntossed me the Amnesty.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I hope you know what you're doing,\" said Baxter at the gleaming glass\ndoorway of the spaceport. \"Why a man who has absolute authority should\nchoose to ride public transportation when he could have his pick of the\nfleetest government ships on Earth--\"\n\nI didn't tell him it was because of little details like stereovision,\nautobars, and, not least of all, comfort, that I had chosen to ride\nthe _Valkyrie_. She sat waiting even now, far out in the center of the\nlanding strip, two hundred towering feet of silver, crammed with all\nthe luxuries engineering ingenuity could put aboard her. I had, thanks\nto a government credit card, a private cabin. I intended to enjoy\nmyself, this trip.\n\nI'd managed to convince Baxter that it was less likely the public would\nsuspect there was anything amiss if I went to Mars incognito, with\nthe Amnesty worn under my clothing, for use only in emergencies. An\nAmnesty-bearer arriving on Mars in a government ship might cause talk.\nDisastrous talk.\n\nBaxter was rattling on and on, giving me the names of my contacts on\nMars for the seventeenth time, and I was giving him perfunctory nods as\nthough I was paying attention, though I was actually watching the other\npassengers leaving the check-in desk. After all, I'd be in space with\nthem for almost two days. You never know what might develop.\n\nThe co-rider I had in mind was a girl, with hair like irridescent\ncornsilk, and a figure that made the stereovision starlets look 2-D in\ncomparison. She had her back to me, but even before she turned around,\nI knew she was beautiful. It was just the way she stood there, facing\nthe passenger-check robot. She--well, she _stood_ like a girl who is\nbeautiful.\n\nThen she turned around, and I gave my instincts an A plus.\n\nHer eyes were the deepest of blues, actually a purple tone, and they\nwere wide, serious and shining. There was a certain determination\nabout the set of her jaw that I liked, and her lips were like soft red\nvelvet. A man could kiss those lips and sink slowly into warm crimson\nseas; lose himself in the heated softness of their gentlest pressures.\n\n\"Delvin!\"\n\nBaxter's voice shattered my reverie, and I tore my eyes from the\ngirl, though the after-effects of dreaming left my mind in confused\nfragments. \"Huh?\" I said, looking at his face and almost failing to\nrecognize it.\n\n\"I said--\" Baxter's voice was impatient and over loud, \"--that you had\nbest, in the interests of open-space safety, not flash that Amnesty\nwhile you're aboard the _Valkyrie_. Passengers have a way of working\nthemselves into a panic that is almost an uncanny gift! They'll all\nstart suspecting their neighbors of treason, or worse, and--\"\n\nBut I wasn't hearing his diatribe any more. As he'd spoken that first\nsentence, the girl with the shimmering cornsilk hair had been passing\nwithin a few feet of us, and I'd felt, rather than actually seen, her\nslender shoulders stiffen beneath the blue silken fabric of her blouse.\nAnd she'd hesitated for a moment in midstep, as though she were going\nto turn about and see which man in the universe was the one to whom the\nAmnesty had been given.\n\nI watched her move out into the sunlight, crossing the field in brisk\nbut dainty strides. Any second now, I told myself. She thinks she\nhasn't been seen. She's getting far enough away so that--Aha! Now!\n\nHalfway to the ship, the girl turned, apparently busily concerned about\nthe clasp of her handbag, as though it had come open without warning. I\nkept my head turned, to look as though I were watching Baxter. But my\neyes were still on her. She looked at me. Then she turned and went on\ntoward the ship.\n\n\"Had to see who I was!\" I said to myself. \"So now she knows I've got\nthe Amnesty. And so--And so, _what_?\"\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nSince antigravity, artificial gravity, and low-thrust take-offs were\nstill in the realm of science-fiction, even the luxury liners like\nthe _Valkyrie_ had to bed their passengers down in shock-absorbing\ncouches until the ship was free of gravitation. So it wasn't until we'd\nachieved escape velocity from Earth that I saw the girl again.\n\nI'd decided to wander into the lounge and try to locate her. It would\nbe an easy task if she were present, what with her startling good\nlooks. But it turned out to be even simpler than that.\n\nShe came to me.\n\nI was just easing myself out of my couch, when my cabin door opened and\nclosed. And locked.\n\nThat last part intrigued me even before I turned about. I was wondering\nwhat sort of menace I had to meet, and bewailing the fact that the\ncollapser was still in my luggage, when I saw who my visitor was. I\nstarted to smile, but the smile left as I saw the saw-edged steak knife\nin her hand.\n\n\"Listen, whoever you are!\" she said. Her voice was low, angrily\nintense, but still a pleasure to hear, somehow.\n\n\"I'm listening, I assure you!\" I said, politely. \"A voice like yours\ndoesn't caress these tired old eardrums every day.\"\n\nShe accorded my compliment a smile, but it was a bleak one, and there\nwas a certain wry lift to her left eyebrow. \"Very suave, I'm sure,\" she\nsaid. \"But I'm not in the mood, thank you. Now, you just sit down on\nyour bunk and behave, and--\"\n\n\"Mind if I get a cigarette?\" I asked, gesturing toward my traveling\ncase. I tried to be casual about it, but I must have failed. I lose my\nhead around women, as I've said.\n\n\"I'll get them for you,\" she said, waving the knife's glittering blade\nat me. I moved away and sat on the edge of my bunk. She flicked the\nclasp open, and spread the two halves apart. There were two shirts and\nsome underwear in the case, plus the collapser. Not a cigarette to be\nseen. She looked at me, narrow-eyed.\n\n\"I don't smoke,\" I explained weakly.\n\n\"You Amnesty-bearers!\" she grated between even, white teeth. \"Ready to\ndestroy everybody with impunity, aren't you! You wouldn't even wait to\nfind out what I wanted!\"\n\n\"I haven't said a word,\" I pointed out delicately.\n\n\"You lied about the cigarettes,\" she accused.\n\n\"How would you treat a stranger who burst into your cabin with an\nunsheathed knife?\" I said, exasperated.\n\nShe looked down at the knife, and reddened. \"Maybe I was a bit abrupt\nabout this. It's just that--\" Her face suddenly crinkled up, and her\ndeep blue-violet eyes burst into tears. Then the knife fell to the\ncarpet, and her face was buried in her hands. I leaned forward and\nremoved the knife from within her reach, then took her by the shoulders.\n\nShe whimpered hopelessly, between shuddering sobs, \"Am I under arrest?\"\n\n\"Depends,\" I said. \"Depends entirely on why you came in here like this.\nAnd what my possession of the Amnesty has to do with it. And how,\" I\nadded, puzzled, \"you seemed to know so much about Amnesty-bearers and\ntheir vile dispositions!\"\n\nShe took her hands from her face, streaked with tears, and said, with a\nshy grin, \"I was guessing at that part. I just kind of assumed they'd\nall be pretty intolerant. Who wouldn't be, with all that power?\"\n\n\"Well, _I_ wouldn't for one,\" I said defensively. \"I only bite when I'm\nbitten.\"\n\nShe found a handkerchief somewhere and began sopping up the wet spots\nfrom her complexion; a complexion, I noted happily, that did not come\noff with water.\n\n\"Have a chair,\" I said, and rang for the steward. \"I hope you drink?\"\n\n\"Not a lot,\" she admitted. \"But I could use one right now.\"\n\n\"Good,\" I said, watching her as she poised gracefully on the chair\nbefore my cabin's private stereo set. \"By the way, my name's Jery. Jery\nDelvin.\"\n\nShe flushed scarlet again, and said, \"Mine is White.\"\n\n\"First name?\" I asked. She paused. \"What is your first name?\"\n\nShe looked at the carpet. \"Snow,\" she said softly.\n\n\"For real?\" I said. \"Like with the dwarfs?\"\n\nShe nodded, as one who'd been over the same conversational ground many\nwearisome times in the past. \"Mother was a Walt Disney fan, back in the\nAge of Movies.\"\n\nI shook my head, and rang for the steward again. \"I think we both could\nuse a drink.\"\n\nLater, the puzzled steward departed for the dining salon to return the\nsteak knife which Snow had \"accidentally\" picked up. We sipped our\ndrinks in mutual silence for a minute or two, regarding one another\nover the rims of our tumblers. To me, Snow was looking better by the\nminute. I even had a momentary thought of flashing the Amnesty at her\nto see if those red velvet lips could fulfill in a tactile way the\npromise they made visually.\n\nBut instead, I said, \"Tell me, do you always attack Amnesty-bearers\nwith the nearest weapon you can lay hold of?\"\n\nSnow laughed musically, shaking her head. \"I didn't mean to come in\nat full threat, Jery,\" she said softly. \"I just wanted some sort of\ndefense in case--Well, Amnesty-bearers think they can ask _anything_\nof a person, and--\"\n\nShe left the explanation unfinished, but I found myself glad I hadn't\ntried pulling rank for a fast romance. \"I'm very curious to know just\nwhat you did come in here for, Snow. Or did you just want a peep at the\nAmnesty? I saw you react when Baxter let it slip back at the spaceport.\"\n\n\"Is that who that was? Chief Baxter, of International Security?\" she\nexclaimed.\n\nI realized I was blurting things, and sighed, \"Damn, I'm talking too\nmuch.\"\n\nSnow's eyes gave me the once-over, and she tilted her head to one side,\ncuriously. \"You know, Jery, you don't look like a government official.\nYou seem to be just an average man.\"\n\nI thought of my dossier and frowned. \"Not quite average, I'm afraid. I\ncan be hopelessly confused by women.\"\n\nSnow digested this, then shrugged. \"Like I said, you seem to be just an\naverage man.\"\n\nI laughed. \"I guess I'd better explain.\"\n\nI told her all about my erstwhile job at Solar Sales, and my mental\nbloc regarding females. When I finished, she was fighting a grin. It\nwas a losing fight. The grin won.\n\n\"If I'd known that, I'd have skipped that steak knife and just entered\nin a bikini,\" she said.\n\n\"You wouldn't have to go even that far,\" I told her. \"One friendly wink\nof your big blue eyes and I'd be putty.\"\n\nSnow raised her eyebrows appraisingly. \"Hmmm. I'll have to remember\nthat in the future.\" It was in fun, but I caught a tinge of serious\nconsideration in it. It gave me an uneasy feeling, a feeling that\nbrought me sharply back to my main query, from which I'd been\nsidetracked a few moments before.\n\n\"But you still haven't told me why you came in here.\"\n\n\"To find you. I figured that if an Amnesty-bearer was on his way to\nMars, there was big trouble. And I think I know what the trouble is,\nbut I need some of the answers you can give me.\"\n\n\"What do you want with government information?\" I said, trying to be\nstiffly formal. \"And what makes you think I'd give it to you?\"\n\n\"Two reasons,\" she said, answering my last question first. \"I can\nsimply wink a big blue eye--unless you've been pulling my leg--and get\nall the information I desire.\"\n\n\"That's only one reason,\" I said carefully. \"What else makes you think\nI'd tell you the information?\"\n\nSnow eyed me soberly, and her face hovered between grim determination\nand fathomless concern. \"My brother Ted is one of the missing Space\nScouts.\"\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n\"Don't pretend,\" Snow said. \"I know. The last two letters from Ted\nconvinced me something was wrong. He never wrote those letters.\"\n\nI thought of Baxter's agents sweltering to turn out perfect facsimiles\nof children's letters, all for nothing. I sighed, and determined to\nmake one last effort to keep the secret a secret. \"You're imagining\nthings. Sometimes, when a person is in an alien environment--which you\nmust admit a strange planet is--their outlook changes a bit.\"\n\nShe was staring at me, her eyes disconcertingly steady, just waiting\nfor me to complete my lie, hardly listening to me. I gave it up and\nstopped. Snow, seeing I was through, unclasped her handbag and handed\nme a letter.\n\nI read it through. When I was finished, I looked at her with what I\nhoped was a noncommittal expression.\n\n\"See what I mean?\" said Snow. \"Three _l_'s in _really_, and terrible\nspellings of _ancient_ and _Martian_. But words like ruins and\ncivilization come through perfectly. It's an obvious attempt on the\npart of someone to deceive me. I just know something's wrong. That's\nwhy I drained my savings account and took this flight. I've got to find\nout what's happened.\"\n\n\"You could have gone to the police.\" I suggested lamely.\n\n\"I did.\" Snow's voice was cold and flat. \"They laughed at me, said I\nwas imagining things. I don't really blame them; all I have to go on\nis a hunch. That, plus the fact that Ted didn't say anything in our\nspecial code.\"\n\nI closed my eyes and groaned. She would have a special code with her\nbrother! \"Sure he didn't simply overlook it?\" I tried.\n\nSnow's face was solemnly earnest. \"In one letter, by the longest\nstretch of the imagination, possibly. But not two in a row.\" She leaned\nforward, her eyes housing desperation. \"So when I learned that you, an\nAmnesty-bearer, were aboard, I just knew it had to be connected with\nwhatever happened to Ted. There is something wrong, isn't there!\"\n\nI hesitated, wondering what to do. This thing was a tightly kept\nsecret, one which I'd sworn to keep. On the other hand, Snow had the\nmost devastating blue eyes. I shifted in my position and felt cold\nmetal bump lightly against my chest beneath my blouse. I'd forgotten\nabout the Amnesty. Hell! I was the most influential, powerful person in\nthe universe, wasn't I? If I wanted to plaster the secret across the\nface of the moon, no one had the authority to say no. Not even Baxter,\nhowever purple he might turn at the idea, could tell me not to do\nanything! And hadn't I been picked by the Brain? Didn't that mean that\nmy instincts in this thing would be the correct ones?\n\nI took one more look into her deep blue eyes and decided that even if\nit was the most disastrous thing to do, I was going to tell her the\ntruth.\n\n\"It depends on what you mean by _wrong_,\" I said.\n\nSnow's brow crinkled. \"Then the boys have vanished?\"\n\nI nodded, and she went deathly pale. \"But don't worry,\" I said quickly.\n\"It may not be as bad as we think.\"\n\n\"What!\" she gasped. \"Fifteen little boys missing on an alien planet,\nand it may not be bad? Are you out of your mind?\"\n\n\"If you'll calm down a bit and let me explain.\" I suggested.\n\nSnow leaned back in her chair and folded her arms. \"Go ahead,\" she said\nresignedly.\n\nI told her about my being picked up at work by the Security Agents, of\nmy meeting with Baxter, and of my investigation of _Phobos II_. She\nlistened that far in silence, then could hold back no longer.\n\n\"But what did you find in those lockers? And what does the takeoff\nthrust and the dehumidifying system have to do with the boys'\ndisappearance?\"\n\nI smiled reassuringly at her. \"Listen, Snow. Baxter, myself, and\nprobably you, too, have one reaction in common about the boys'\nvanishment from a ship in space. Our very first word on the subject\nis an incredulous 'Impossible.' Of course, we're using it in the\ncolloquial sense; that of 'I don't believe it!' But if we take it in\nits literal sense, we'll be absolutely correct. Such a thing _is_\nimpossible.\"\n\nSnow opened her mouth, but I shushed her unspoken words with a wave\nof my hand. \"I know, you're about to spout something about magnetic\ngrapples and mid-space boardings, or even about long distance\nteleporting rays--none of which have as yet, so far as we know, been\ninvented--or some such rot. But what are the arguments against these\ntwo solitary possibilities?\n\n\"As to the first; Anders, the pilot, would surely have noticed another\nship in his vicinity. The meteorite warnings would have begun jangling\nwhen the ship was still hundreds of miles away. And if it could,\nsomehow, evade the signalling devices, Anders would still have heard\nthe ship make contact. You can't drive up in a spaceship big enough to\nhold at least fifteen normal-sized boys, besides your own crew, and\njust not be noticed!\n\n\"So we come to the second, and only other, possibility: Were the boys\nkidnapped by some ultrasuper teleportation beam? The answer, of course,\nis a resounding, 'Hell, no!'\"\n\nSnow frowned. \"Why?\"\n\n\"The thrust, Snow, that's why. If that weight were suddenly removed\nfrom the ship--boys of Space Scout age usually run to an average\nweight of one hundred pounds, or, in this case, a total of about\nfifteen hundred pounds--if that weight had suddenly become missing,\nthen Anders' fuel consumption, remaining the same but with less mass\nto thrust, would have made him overshoot Earth. This, however, did not\nhappen. In fact, the gauges in the pilot's compartment plainly show\nthat the ship's mass was, on landing, within a fraction of an ounce of\nits takeoff mass. Therefore, no mass at all was lost in space except\nthat expended by the consumption of fuel.\"\n\nSnow shook her head, bewildered. \"But that doesn't make sense!\" she\ncried. \"If they weren't taken off the ship in space, and they weren't\naboard her when she landed, then--\" All at once, she got it, and sat\nback with a sharp gasp.\n\n\"Exactly,\" I said. \"They never even left Mars.\"\n\n\"But you said that this man Anders had seen to it that they were all\naboard before takeoff.\"\n\n\"Which I have no doubt he did. But the civilian mind skips a few\ndetails when it thinks over his report. They see him look at the boys,\nnod, then go up front and press the starter button. It doesn't happen\nquite that simply. There are a lot of other things to be done. Anders\nhad to go into the pilot's cabin, strap himself in place, check the\nguages which showed his course, mass, fuel supply, thrust control,\noxygen-nitrogen mixture, and a million and one other things. He had to\ncheck the last and most important dial examined before takeoff; the one\nwhich told him that each of the fifteen takeoff racks in the ship were\noccupied.\"\n\n\"But--\" Snow cut in, bewildered, leaning forward.\n\n\"Let me finish.\" She set her mouth and sat back again. \"He had to know\nthat, because takeoff thrust on a human being _not_ snugly in his\npadded rack would probably squash him to pieces against a bulkhead. So\nthere had to be something in those racks in order to fool Anders into\nthinking that the scouts were still aboard; something which, by the\ntime Anders had maneuvered the ship into its flight vector, would be\ngone without leaving a trace, or not much of a trace, unless one were\nactually looking for it.\"\n\n\"What?\" asked Snow, fascinated.\n\n\"Ice,\" I said. \"Hunks of ice in every one of the fifteen bunks. Ice\nwhich the temperature control unit would commence to melt immediately.\"\n\n\"But that would mean ice blocks of hundred-pound weights! They couldn't\nmelt so fast. Wouldn't Anders be likely to come back to the racks and\nfind them still there?\"\n\n\"Not,\" I said, \"with the efficiency of the temperature control system.\nSharp deviations from comfortable levels in a spaceship can be\ndisastrous. So the thermostat in the ship is set for a rigid fifty-five\ndegrees, and it's built to keep the interior heat at that level. Put\nfifteen-hundred pounds of ice on board, and the heat in the rack cabin\ngoes up, trying to get the temperature back to its correct level. The\nice, lying there melting, absorbs the heat swiftly. So more heat is\npumped into the room. Well, figure fifteen minutes before all the ice\nwas liquified. More than enough of a margin of safety.\"\n\n\"Safety for whom?\" Snow asked.\n\n\"For whoever didn't want Anders finding any evidence of how the\ndisappearance was accomplished. About an hour passed between takeoff\nand the time he checked the cabin. You must remember that Anders had to\nmaneuver the ship free of Mars' gravity, set his course for Earth, and\nthen make a final check of all his equipment before going back into the\nship proper. That takes plenty of time.\"\n\n\"But how could you figure this out?\" Snow asked, her eyes wide with\ninterest. \"And where did the ice come from?\"\n\n\"From the night side of Mars,\" I said. \"Where the temperature drops\nbelow zero as soon as the sun has gone down. Remember, the ship was\nin a landing berth, and had just been prepared for a takeoff. The\ntechnicians would have moved away to be clear of the blast. In fact,\nthey'd all be inside their shacks, having coffee against the chilly\nweather they'd been exposed to. All it took was someone bright enough\nto get hold of the water tank, and to spray the water into any handy\ncontainer where it would freeze solid in a few seconds. Then the chunks\nof ice were substituted for the boys in the bunks, and Anders took off\nwith no one but himself on board.\"\n\n\"You reasoned this out?\" Snow said, incredulously. \"How?\"\n\n\"My gift for spotting, which I told you about. Once I knew that the\nboys could not have been kidnapped from space, and that something had\nto be making up for their mass aboard the _Phobos II_, I tried to think\nof _where_ this something could be kept. It wasn't in the open, nor in\nany of the storage space. Therefore, it had to be within the bulkheads.\nBut what could go within the bulkheads? Only water which had been taken\nfrom the air to keep the humidity down. And yet this water had to\nremain--without a container, mind you--in the fifteen racks at takeoff\ntime so that Anders' dial would register them as all being securely in\nplace before he pressed the starter. So in what form could water sit on\na bunk without a container?\"\n\nSnow smiled helplessly, \"Ice, of course. You make it sound almost\nidiotically simple.\" Then her face fell. \"But it's only a theory, isn't\nit! Or is it?\"\n\nI shrugged. \"It seems borne out by a few things, Snow. When I entered\nthe _Phobos_, I checked beneath the canvas covering on one of the\ntakeoff racks. There was grit there, which is a little unusual on a\nmilitary vessel, with their one-track-mindedness about things being\nspic and span. And water running through canvas, taking along the dirt\nthat even a military white-glove inspection can't find, leaves behind a\nresidue of grit.\"\n\n\"It still doesn't seem enough,\" she said wistfully, as if begging me to\nprove my theory correct for her peace of mind. I was glad to oblige.\n\n\"There's more. Water weighs in at 62.4 pounds per cubic foot. So,\nfifteen hundred pounds of water would occupy approximately twenty four\ncubic feet; the exact surplus found aboard the _Phobos II_, in the\nbulkhead tubing.\"\n\nSnow looked startled, but still unconvinced. \"To kidnap fifteen\nboys, without Anders noting even the slightest sign of a struggle or\ndisturbance....\"\n\nI nodded. \"Right. It is odd, isn't it! This bothered me, too, until I\nchecked the contents of those storage lockers.\"\n\n\"Oh. I'd forgotten about that!\" she exclaimed. \"What did you find?\"\n\n\"Roughly, without going into precise itemization, there were bottles of\nspace sickness capsules, clean handkerchiefs, toothbrushes, packets of\nsoap and the like.\"\n\n\"And the like?\" Snow remarked. \"What likeness is there between those\nthings?\"\n\nI smiled happily, and told her, simply, the clinker I'd spotted at once\non seeing those items: \"They're all items which small boys hate with\nalmost apocalyptic fury. But I did not find such things as jackknives,\ncandy, chewing gum--Shall I go on?\"\n\n\"You mean that whoever kidnapped the boys took along the things which\nthe boys wanted?\" she asked, her lovely voice making an unbelieving\nsqueak on the last word.\n\n\"I mean,\" I said softly, \"that I believe the Space Scouts left the\n_Phobos II_ of their own free will.\"\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nBy evening of the following day we were in descent toward Marsport; a\nslow planet-circling downward spiral with a steady braking by the nose\njets, lest we hit the atmosphere too fast and burn up. Even a thin\natmosphere like that of Mars was no fun to enter at interplanetary\nspeeds.\n\nSnow, looking through the viewport beside her chair in the lounge,\nsighed gently and turned her lovely gaze back to my face. \"I wish--\"\nshe began softly.\n\nI laid my hand upon hers. \"We've been over that, Snow. You must return\nto Earth. You haven't a chance of finding those boys. Hell, if you\nhad, the Brain would have picked you. And I, with the Amnesty, can go\nanywhere, do anything, get results in a hurry.\"\n\n\"But if I came with you....\" she pleaded in a tense whisper.\n\nI shook my head, with finality. \"I've told you over and over. You wreck\nmy spotter's instinct, Snow. If you're with me, I'll never be able to\nlocate those boys. I'll miss even obvious clues.\"\n\n\"You weren't so fuddleheaded yesterday when you told me how you'd\nreasoned out the real facts about the disappearance,\" she accused.\n\n\"Hell, your presence affects my thinking, not my memory! Come on, now,\nsee it my way, will you?\"\n\nI stood up. \"It looks like good-by for a while, Snow.\"\n\nShe faced me, solemnly. \"Yes, it does. You'll be careful, won't you?\nAnd you'll let me know if--if--\"\n\n\"I promise. Before I let Baxter know, even!\"\n\nWe stood like that a moment, scarcely a foot apart, and I fought an\nimpulse to take her into my arms. Then, with no warning, she flung her\narms about my neck, and I had my first taste of those red velvet lips.\n\nThen she was gone from the lounge. I glanced at the wall chronometer,\nand began to move toward my cabin in a hurry. Less than five minutes\ntill set-down. I entered at a dead run.\n\nI'd barely lashed myself to the rack when the landing thrust began.\nHowever, I'd taken two antipressure tablets, as per the instructions\nposted in the room, and I was comfortably unconscious even before the\npressure began to grow.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen I awoke, there were two men in red and bronze uniforms standing\nover my rack. They didn't seem very pleased to find me there. One of\nthem had my bag open, and was holding my collapser in his hand, and the\nlook he was giving me wasn't the cheeriest I'd ever seen.\n\n\"What are you guys doing here?\" I demanded. In speaking, I tried to\ngesture. That's when I became aware of the cold steel manacles on my\nwrists. \"What the hell?\"\n\nThe one with the weapon hefted it thoughtfully in his palm. \"Don't you\nknow it's a death-penalty offense to have possession of a collapser,\nchum?\" he said.\n\nThe other one, not waiting for my answer, began undoing the straps\nacross my body, and assisting me to my feet.\n\n\"Say, look, what do you guys mean by coming here and--\"\n\n\"We were alerted,\" said the first man. \"By an Amnesty-bearer.\"\n\nI simply stared at him for an unbelieving instant. Then I said,\n\"You're crazy! There's only one Amnesty in existence, and--\"\n\nWith horrible clarity, I recalled Snow's impassioned farewell in the\nlounge, and the way her hands had darted about; my neck.\n\nI brought my manacled hands up to my blouse and felt frantically for\nthe red and bronze disc. The Amnesty was gone.\n\n\"Come along, now,\" said the one who'd helped me up.\n\n\"Where are we going?\" I demanded.\n\n\"You're to be held incommunicado,\" he said, \"until the Amnesty-bearer\nreturns. Come along, now. We haven't got all day!\"\n\n\"Day?\" I said, and looked toward the viewport. Sure enough the glaring\nMartian sunlight was pouring into the cabin. \"But we were landing on\nthe night side,\" I said, confused.\n\n\"You did,\" said the one with the collapser. \"Only it was arranged that\nyou'd stay asleep for a while, till we could get here.\"\n\n\"Arranged how?\" I choked furiously. Then I remembered the capsules\nI'd taken. I looked toward the instruction posted on the inside of\nthe cabin door. Now that I was in no great hurry, I could see where\nsomeone had, with ordinary pen and ink, gone over the numeral 1, and\nmade it into a passable 2. Someone, I thought bitterly, with shimmering\ncornsilk hair and red velvet lips!\n\n\"Now, just a minute, you guys, I can explain.\" I said.\n\n\"Stow it,\" said the one with the gun. \"Come on, get moving.\"\n\n\"When Chief Baxter hears about this--\" I growled.\n\nHe laughed. \"You know Baxter has no authority to over-ride an\nAmnesty-bearer's orders!\" Once again, he motioned with the collapser in\nthe direction of the door.\n\n\"Well then, boys,\" I said, in as threatening a tone as I could muster,\n\"let your fat heads chew on this for a while: the girl who has that\nAmnesty stole it from me! You just get hold of Baxter and verify it.\nBecause if you don't, there are going to be two slightly-used Security\nAgent's uniforms for sale!\"\n\nThey looked at each other, frowning. Then the one with the gun scowled.\nThe other guy paled. \"Say, Charlie, what if there is something to his\nstory? What do you think we ought to do?\"\n\nCharlie blinked and thought hard. Then a smile crossed his face.\n\"Nothing,\" he said. \"We were given orders by an Amnesty-bearer, and all\nwe have to do is carry them out to be in the clear.\"\n\n\"Oh, yeah?\" I grunted. \"Five'll get you ten Baxter thinks differently!\"\n\nThe one who wasn't Charlie hesitated, and his grip, hitherto vise-tight\non my upper arm, went suddenly slack. \"Disobeying an Amnesty-bearer is\nunprecedented,\" he said carefully.\n\n\"So is the theft of the Amnesty!\" I shouted in exasperation.\n\nThe other one looked at Charlie. \"Maybe we ought to call Baxter, just\nin case.\"\n\n\"In my book,\" Charlie muttered, \"that's not holding a guy\nincommunicado!\"\n\n\"The hell it's not,\" I snorted. \"I won't communicate with him. You two\nguys do it. Do it any way you can square it with your sense of duty.\nEither tell Baxter you have a man in custody by the name of Jery Delvin\nor that the Amnesty is in the possession of a blue-eyed blonde girl,\nand see what he says!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTwo hours later, I was facing the image of a purple-faced Chief Baxter\non an interplanetary videoscreen. \"Sorry to be so long, Delvin,\" he\nsaid apologetically. \"But I'd left orders not to be disturbed. Anyway,\nI've given the men instructions to return the collapser to you, and an\nauthorization permit for it, in case you meet any more agents.\"\n\n\"Which heaven forbid!\" I growled. \"No red tape with an Amnesty. Ha!\"\n\n\"Uh. Yes. So you can continue with your search, Delvin. Have you found\nanything interesting?\"\n\n\"Full report when I get back, Baxter,\" I said. \"Right now, I have a\ndate with a beautiful blonde.\"\n\n\"A date?\" he choked out. \"But--\"\n\n\"Signing off,\" I said, and cut the circuit. I belted the collapser into\nplace around my waist, and started off for the city proper. Somewhere\nin Marsport there was a lovely blonde girl named Snow White, who could\ndo anything, anything at all, and get away with it. Anything but one\nthing.\n\nShe couldn't get within a foot of me again! Not if I had anything to\nsay about it.\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nMarsport, the largest--if you excluded the prospecting encampments\nwithin a hundred-mile radius of the place--city on the Planet,\nhad grown fast, from the time of its founding in 2014. Originally\nsimply a mining site for the Tri-Planet Refining Corporation, it\nhad spread backward from the area of the original mines in a rough\ncircle, beginning with the monotonous quonset huts of the miners, and\nmodulating in its move toward the perimeter to smart iron-and-adobe\nstructures. Some of these, thanks to the less-than-half Earth's normal\ngravity, as high as fifteen stories.\n\nThe planet, barely half the diameter of Earth and a tenth of Earth's\nmass, was a minerologist's paradise. The rusty red sands of the Martian\ndesert were almost pure ferrous oxide, a source of both iron for the\nprofitable refineries and oxygen for the inhabitants of Marsport.\n\nGoing Los Angeles one ridge better, Marsport was completely\ncircumscribed by high crimson hills, and this natural bowl formation,\nplus oxygen's heavier-than-air-density, allowed the city to be filled\nwith breathable atmosphere, much as tobacco smoke can lie surging\ngently within an ashtray if the air in a room is still. This made\nplanetary wind-storms a hazard.\n\nOutside the hills, of course, the air was thin, cold and barely\nable to support life, being comparable to the biting cold air atop\nMount Everest. Human lungs could not breathe it for long without\nfreezing. Naturally, there was a high casualty rate amongst the\nprospectors, despite their pressurized metal huts and oxygen masks.\nBut uranium, as it had been since the advent of the atomic age, was\nenormously well-paying to the one miner in twenty to find any in\nMars' body breaking hinterlands with its roasting dry heat of day and\nblood-freezing cold by night.\n\nAnd then there was parabolite.\n\nThis mineral, found in abundance beneath the Martian sands, was,\ntheoretically, worth ten times its weight in gold to the people who\nmight mine it. I say theoretically, because no one had as yet found\na way of getting any ore. Paradoxically, the feature which made\nparabolite so vitally desired was the same feature which prevented\nanyone from mining it: it was totally indestructible.\n\nThe name had been given it by the scientists who studied the three\nsolitary fragments of it found small enough for shipping back to Earth.\nThere was just no way of chipping a piece loose for analysis. The name\nwas due to the oddly shaped molecules which made up this mineral. All\nof them seemed to be joined atomically into perfect parabolas, no\nmatter which way you came at them. Which meant, in effect, that when\nanything was brought to bear against the substance, pressure which\nstruck one end of the parabolically curved molecules was retransmitted\nby the other end, back to the thing putting pressure on it. Result: it\n\"hit back\" with a violence equal to that applied to it, and sustained\nno damage whatsoever to itself. Chemicals were tried when pickaxes had\nfailed, but the substance was inert. It gave no sign of reacting either\nto hydrofluoric acid, which could eat its way through glass, or to aqua\nregia, which could eat through anything else.\n\nThey even tried using the collapsers on it. These deadly weapons, which\nworked by the simple process of killing the attraction between the\nprotons and electrons, could, in the briefest time, reduce anything\nto less than dust. The electrons spun away in a blinding blue-white\nflash, and the stripped-down protons, being less than atomic in size,\nfell silently down into the heart of the planet, leaving a virtual\nnothingness where the object had been.\n\nBut on parabolite, even these mighty weapons were useless. Oh, they had\nfound that training a battery of them on a chunk of parabolite, for\na period of days, with an enormous drain of power keeping the weapons\nfiring continuously, did get results. The overall mass of the chunk\nwas reduced by one-millionth of a gram. Which was less than useless,\nbecause not only was that amount completely impractical to obtain,\nbut it was not even obtained, thanks to the collapsers' destructive\npotency. It was merely destroyed.\n\nAnd so, vast acres of this fortune-making mineral lay all about the\nplanet, as common as sandstone was on Earth. And no one had any idea of\nhow to get any of it, not even the natives.\n\nYes, there were natives, of a sort, on Mars. Strange beings, albeit\nfriendly, made up, except for a fraction of a percent, of sugar.\n\nThey were crystalline, these beings, covered over with prisms of bright\nred sugar that gave them, with their scuttling gait and long pointed\ntails, the appearance of man-sized lizards. A lot of their metabolism\nwas a mystery to us, but we did know that they, like plants on Earth,\nlived by a sort of modified photosynthesis.\n\nAt first thought, this seems strange, since we are used to green as the\nprimary necessity in a photosynthetic metabolism. But it made sense\nwhen you remember that foliage looks green because the green rays of\nthe sun are reflected, and the red rays absorbed. Since a crystal\npasses only the rays which correspond to its color-structure, they\ndid quite well, photosynthetically. Air and water were their chief\nfoods, of course. The water they inhaled through rubbery-looking hollow\ntongues which extended a good two feet from their wide, dragon like\nmouths. The distance was a necessity, due to their exteriors, which, as\nI've said, were made of red crystalline sugar. They could take water on\nthe inside, but it was fatal on the outside.\n\nThe first men on Mars had felt pretty silly standing guard over their\nencampments with water pistols. But the sugarfeet, as they came to be\ncalled, proved friendly enough in a nonobsequious way. They seemed, on\ninvestigation, to be the Martian equivalent of cats.\n\nBy that I mean that they must have been the self-sufficient pets of the\nAncient Martians. They tended to be standoffish and annoyingly smug,\nbut not menacing in any way. After all, why should they be menacing?\nWe had nothing they wanted. Our food was useless to them, as were our\nclothes, gold or anything else in the way of possessions. They liked\nour water, of course, but long evolution in the Martian deserts had\nkept their physical need for this commodity down to a minimum. The\naverage sugarfoot drank about a pint of water per week, which was no\nmenace to us, even when we'd first landed and water was in short supply.\n\nBut of the Ancients, they could tell us nothing, any more than an\nalien landing on a depopulated Earth could find out about men from an\nalley cat. We knew there had been intelligent life, though. There were\nremnants of buildings still to be seen half-buried in the rust-red\nsands, and bewildering little artifacts for which no conceivable use\nhad as yet been convincingly postulated. There was one thing, though,\nthat bothered us about these buildings and artifacts.\n\nThey were made out of parabolite.\n\nHow had the Martians carved, or molded, or otherwise affected the shape\nof this indestructible mineral? We had no idea.\n\nMarsport had a population of about one hundred thousand families,\naveraging five people to a family, so it was a good-sized city for Snow\nto hide herself in.\n\nOn the other hand, I wasn't absolutely sure just why I was looking for\nher. After all, I didn't really need the Amnesty. A collapser carries a\nlot of weight on its own. And an Amnesty's power was only in proportion\nto the esteem in which an approached individual held the authority of\nthe World Government.\n\nThe more I thought of it, the more I wondered why I was so determined\nto find Miss Snow White. She'd only be a hindrance to me, really, what\nwith short-circuiting my spotting technique. And a man on a mission of\nsuch grave importance wouldn't simply seek out a girl because she had\ncornsilk hair and red velvet lips, would he? Well, would he?\n\nAs I thought all of this, I was striding swiftly along Von Braun\nStreet, the main thoroughfare, ignoring the stares of passers-by as\nthey spotted the golden collapser belted about my waist. Passing a\nsmall bar, I happened to glance in through the window. And there was\nher photograph on the stereo over the bar. The men along its polished\nmetal length were staring at her with interest.\n\nCurious and puzzled, I turned back and went inside the bar to hear what\nwas being said about her.\n\n\"Shoot to kill! Repeat: Shoot to kill!\" said the announcer's voice from\nthe speaker. \"She is not to be obeyed under any circumstances. The\nAmnesty is a forgery. Repeat: A forgery.\"\n\nI found myself leaning weakly against a wall by the door as the sense\nof the message came home to me. Baxter had lost no time making up for\nmy stupidity in losing the Amnesty. He didn't dare admit it had been\nstolen, because Amnesty-bearers, like myself, were considered by the\npopulace to be intelligent, and very clever. It wouldn't do to weaken\npublic opinion of IS.\n\nBut to kill! From Baxter's viewpoint, it made sense. If she were simply\nshot down, then she couldn't mention the fact that it had been stolen,\neither.\n\nAs a patriot, I should have been happy to see my government operating\nwith such efficient dispatch. For some reason, I was not happy at all.\nI thought of those soft warm lips pressing gently upward upon my own,\nalbeit in the act of deception, and felt suddenly sick inside.\n\n\"Something for you, buddy?\"\n\nI looked up. The bartender, his voice mirroring the polite caution with\nwhich people spoke to collapser toters, was down at my end of the bar,\nby the doorway, his face strained into a nervously hearty anxiety to\nplease.\n\nIrritably, I leaned forward to rasp a negation into his face at close\nrange, and then I decided to create no more ruckus than I had to.\n\"Okay,\" I grunted.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" he said, spinning about and commencing to do dexterous\nthings with the flashy array of bottles behind the bar and a tall\nfrosty mixer.\n\n\"Down the hatch,\" he smiled, setting the glass of shining chartreuse\nliquid before me.\n\nI nodded, and took a sip. It was good, whatever it was. It was a\nlittle nose-tingling, like a stinger, and yet there was something, a\nnot unpleasant bitterish aftertaste. The glass fell from my suddenly\nnumb fingers and shattered loudly on the bar. I tried to get up, and\ncouldn't.\n\nThe floor of the bar was warping, tugging at me. I was unconscious\nhalfway down.\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nMy first awareness was the whine of the converters, audible everywhere\nin Marsport, if not by ear, then by the soles of one's feet. Their\nthundering dynamos plunged potent destructive rays against the Martian\nsands, leaving in their wake invisible fountains of nascent oxygen and\nshimmering puddles of orange-white molten iron. They went on day and\nnight without ceasing, partly to keep the mining companies on Earth\nfrom losing their franchises with Tri-Planet, but primarily to keep the\nMarsport populace from tumbling down in the streets with cyanosed lips\nand glazing eyes, as the breathable atmosphere sloughed away over the\nhilltops.\n\nSo I knew that I was in Marsport, at least. But not much else. My\nhands, when I tried to move them, proved to be bound, and tightly, at\nthat. My fingers felt swollen and numb when I tried to flex them. There\nwas something, a hood, a sack, a cloth, over my head, fastened about my\nthroat, impairing my breathing slightly and my vision altogether.\n\nI found, though, that I could move my legs, but it was little help when\nI wouldn't know where they were carrying me if I chanced using them.\nFor all I knew, I was lying on my back atop a precipice. Moving about\ncould be disastrous.\n\nSo I lay still and spent my time wondering why that bartender should\nhave slipped me a mickey.\n\nIt was senseless, in a way. I mean, even granting that there was some\nsort of inimical agency here attempting to forestall investigation\nof the missing Space Scouts, how did they know that I was the proper\nAmnesty-bearer? Or that there was an Amnesty-bearer around? And,\nknowing this, how would they know that I'd turn into that particular\nbar?\n\nThe thoughts were too confusing, so I gave them up, and just lay there\nin darkness, worrying. And not, strangely enough, about my fate, but\nabout Snow's. Security Agents were keen-sighted and perfect shots. And\na collapser beam wasn't choosy about what it annihilated.\n\nI'd come to while lying on my back, but had chanced turning over on my\nface to get my body weight off my hands. A little life seemed to be\noozing back into my thickened fingers. I tried the cords on my wrists\nagain, but they were still taut and firm. Then one of my fingers found\nthe loose end of the cord, and felt its surface. It was one of those\nnylon ropes with a steel wire center. I gave up trying to undo it.\n\nHow long had I been lying wherever I was, anyhow? I had no means of\nknowing. It might have been an hour, a day, or merely minutes. How far\nbehind Snow's trail had I fallen thanks to this damnable delay? And did\nshe know she was being hunted?\n\nI shifted over onto my right hip to feel if my collapser holster were\nstill in place. Something pressed back against me, but it had too much\ngive to it. The holster was there, all right, but it was empty.\n\nObviously, I couldn't do anything else until I could see. I tried\ncatching at the hooding material with my teeth, but it was stretched\ntautly across my features, and evaded them with maddening efficiency.\nOn reflection, I saw that this was the reason I hadn't smothered.\nLooser cloth would have leaped easily to block mouth and nostrils\nagainst my unconscious breathing. I wondered if the tautness was an\nover-sight, or purposely done to ensure my staying alive.\n\nThat took me about three seconds to figure out. If I was still alive,\nthen they wanted me for something further. If they hadn't, then the\ncord binding the hood to my neck would have been used as a simple,\nefficient garrote.\n\nIf my hands could reach the neck cord, though, I might be able to untie\nit, and then try my hand cords with my teeth.\n\nSlowly, I managed to slide my knees forward until I was resting solely\non kneecaps and chin. Then I twisted, stretched, and tugged with my\narms until the binding cord slipped over my rump and slid to the backs\nof my knees. My chin, from all the weight on it, felt as though it had\nbeen kicked by a fullback, but I ignored the pain and flopped awkwardly\nover onto my side, then rolled carefully onto my back, with my ankles\nsomewhere over my face.\n\nNow came the rough part. I found myself, in the next five minutes of\ntorture, wishing I'd done more toe-touching exercises in my erstwhile\nsedentary life. The cord slipped down as far as the tendons behind my\nheels, but would budge no further, no matter how I strained. With my\nboots off, I might have made the last inch or so, but they were on, and\nhad thick durex heels. It was going to be a struggle.\n\nWhen it happened, it happened all at once. I was wrenching at my bonds,\ngritting my teeth and pulling, despite the binding agony that flared in\nmy wrists. And then I smacked myself in the face with my own hands as\nmy feet jackknifed back to the ground. I lay there panting awhile, then\nstarted feeling about my neck for the end of the cord fastening the\nhood in place.\n\nMy fingers, thicker than ever after my struggles, were almost without\nthe power to feel as I fumbled them against the knot in the cord. In\ntheir bloated state, they were just slightly more manageable than\nsausages.\n\nI let them work by touch, and kept my mind away from what they were\ndoing, lest I begin to scream in frustration at their bumbling efforts.\nThen something slipped and gave way. The bottom folds of the hooding\ncloth fell open from my throat. I fairly tore the thing from my head\nand looked around me.\n\nThere wasn't much light to see by, just a pallid gray glow in the\nair, but I could tell I was in a cellar of some sort. The walls had\nthat dusty look to them, and there was a flight of stone stairs going\nup toward a door, under which seeped a dim sheet of light. I started\nlooking around for some other way out. There was none visible, although\nI couldn't see too much outside the area where that dim light struck\nand diffused before vanishing into darkness.\n\nI licked my lips, took in some deep draughts of air, then began dulling\nmy incisors on the wrist cords. The knot, unfortunately, was on the\nulnar side of the wrists, just behind the little fingers. The only\nway I could get at that was to bend my hands tightly up to my neck, as\nthough I were about to choke myself, and work over the underside of my\nwrists. It was awkward as hell, but finally that cord, too, dropped\naway, and I was free.\n\nWell, relatively free. I didn't know how my chances were of getting out\nof that cellar or whatever it was.\n\nWhile it was probably only setting myself up for a return to my bonds,\nI decided to do the obvious thing and head up that flight of stairs.\n\nBut before I did so, I scouted around for some sort of weapon. On a\npile of empty crates I located a pair of shears, the sort used to snip\nthrough the metal tape that binds bulky crates like those. It wasn't\nmuch, and was clumsy to hold, but it was all I had, so I took it along\nwith me.\n\nCreeping up the stairs, I found the door locked from the outside, but\nit was a handle-or-key operated lock, the kind that can be opened from\nthe inside by simply turning the knob. Apparently my captors were less\nconcerned about me getting out than they were about anyone else getting\nin. It figured, though. I was supposed to be unconscious, hooded, and\nbound.\n\nShutting the door behind me, I found myself in a corridor, not itself\nlighted, but getting light from somewhere at the far end. As I moved\ncautiously down its length, I was thankful for the treeless Martian\ntopography which had occasioned all edifices being built of metal\nand/or stone. There wasn't a chance of my making the floor creak.\n\nI arrived at the end of the corridor, and paused behind the edge of an\nopen door, through which the light came streaming.\n\nAnd there were voices, too. Voices, and odd clacking noises.\n\nGingerly, I lowered myself all the way to the flooring and peeked\naround the very bottom of the door frame, below, I hoped, the eye level\nof anyone in that room.\n\nIt was, I saw, the bar in which I'd been mickeyed. But long opaque\nblinds were latched in place over the windows and glass door, and the\npeople in the place didn't seem to be customers. Some of them were\nseated on the barstools, and some on the bar itself. Others occupied\ntables and chairs along the wall opposite the bar. All were facing the\narea between the bar and the tables, in which was set another table.\nThere was a man seated at it. A man, and something else.\n\nIt was this something else which was emitting the clacking noises I'd\nheard. I looked with fascinated horror at its long, flare-nostrilled\nface, and rheumy-looking wide-set eyes. It had no hair, nor could I\ndiscern anything like ears, until it turned its head and I saw the hole\njust behind the back edge of the cruelly-toothed jaw. The overhead\nlight, as this creature turned its head, glinted red off squarish\nconical scales, and I realized with a little shock that I was seeing my\nfirst sugarfoot.\n\nSeen in the flesh, as it were, it looked considerably more menacing\nthan the photos I'd seen of it back on Earth. At that cosmic distance,\nI could believe that it was docile, albeit standoffish, and was, while\nnot a friend to man, at least an accepted neutral. But looking at those\neyes and teeth, I decided the Public Information Bureau on Earth was\nfull of beans. That damned thing looked dangerous!\n\nAs I watched, it made some more clacking noises, and the man beside\nit, whom I recognized as the bartender, frowned and clacked something\nback. His sounds didn't have the same snapping quality to them, but I\ncouldn't doubt they were conversing in some language. Which language\njust had to be the sugarfoot's.\n\nAnd that was another thing the PIB on Earth hadn't mentioned. Contact\nbetween man and sugarfoot was supposed to be impossible, except in the\nform of rudimentary gestures. They were supposed to be able to learn to\nfollow certain Earth words, if you dinned them at them often enough.\nBut that was all. Now, here was an Earthman talking to one! It'd make\ninteresting news for Baxter when I got back.\n\nIf I got back.\n\nThe bartender, in the course of his speech, pointed at something on\nthe table before him and shook his head. I raised up slowly on my\nhands from my prone position, and got a glimpse of the object under\ndiscussion. It was my collapser, goldenly glinting in the incandescent\nlight.\n\nJust from following the bartender's gestures and facial expressions,\nI began to gather some of what was going on. I didn't know why, but\nthey seemed to be dickering over possession of the weapon. And unless\nI misjudged the man's now-and-then pointing in the direction of where\nthat stone cellar lay, I, too, was on the auction block.\n\nThe way I figured it, this sugarfoot wanted me, and it wanted the\ncollapser. The bartender seemed willing enough to surrender me, but was\nnixing a deal on the weapon.\n\nThe drawn blinds and the men's lowered voices indicated that it must be\nnightfall. I'd started out into Marsport at midday. The rotation of the\nplanet is only fractionally different from Earth's, so that meant that\nat least six hours had gone by since my capture. But a bar closing down\nat sunset, just when its business would begin picking up, would look\npretty suspicious, so I could figure on probably another six hours,\nputting the time at somewhere past midnight.\n\nI wished I could leave with the collapser, but I had my doubts that I\ncould cross the floor of that room to snatch it from the table without\nbeing grabbed by someone. I shook my head and withdrew back into the\ncorridor to think. No point in risking my life to get that weapon back,\nwhen I could simply slip out some other way and alert IS. A team of\nagents could reduce the bar to a sparkling crater in seconds, along\nwith the men, sugarfoot and collapser.\n\nIt wouldn't be quite as glorious as acting the hero by myself, but it'd\nbe considerably safer. I got back to my feet and started inspecting the\nrest of the corridor, seeking a less populated exit than the one onto\nVon Braun street.\n\nBack the way I'd come, there was only the door to that cellar. I\ndoubled back toward the other door by the bar itself, ducked down low,\nand scuttled past it on my hands and knees. No outcry came from the\nroom, just the vociferous clacking noises, and an occasional mutter\nfrom one of the surrounding men. I figured I'd made it okay. The\ncorridor bent, just past that doorway, and ended in a window. It was\nopen. I stuck my head out and looked around.\n\nSomething was glowing just beneath me, something that reflected almost\nintolerable heat against my face when I looked down at it.\n\nA river of liquified iron, ten feet wide, ran along a bed carved into\nthe rocky soil. It was a good five feet between the bottom of the\nwindow and the sullen smolder of that hellish stream, but my face and\nthroat felt already parboiled. Before ducking back into the relatively\ncooler temperature inside the corridor, I shot a glance toward the\nsource of this impassable moat, and understood why it was there.\n\nAbout two miles along this radiant river, I saw the towering metallic\nhulk of the converters, their shimmering molecule-blasting rays\nleaping from a multi-noded sender plate to a cup-shaped receiver. And,\nsilhouetted against the black velvet night sky, above and between these\ndeadly twins, was a monster escalator, carrying ton after ton of rich\nred Martian sand to a point in space directly above the flashing beam,\nand spilling it downward through the raw energy below.\n\nWhere the sand--pure ferrous oxide--struck the beam, I could not look\nwithout daring blindness, so violent were those disruptive reactions.\nBut just above it, a silvery cloud arose and dissipated itself; the\nfreed oxygen, enriching the atmosphere in this gigantic crater that was\nMarsport. And below it, a cataract of burning metal sprayed downward\ninto an enormous vat, the sides of which were spouting a continual flow\nof this dangerous liquid into troughs which spread out in a fanlike\npattern that must have encompassed the entire city.\n\nIt took me a few minutes of thought, but I figured it out, as I\ndrew back through the window from the heat. It was not enough that\nthe converters could supply the citizenry with breathable air. The\nplanetary temperature at night was below the level at which a man could\nlive, save with the most cumbersome, demanding precautions, such as are\ndemanded by arctic exploration on Earth.\n\nAnd so, instead of merely letting the metal cool into ingots before it\nwas shipped where it was needed, it was channeled through the city,\npassing behind all the buildings where alleys would normally be, and\nwarming the environment so that going into the night air would not mean\nsure death by freezing. I could not see the far end of the trough, but\nI knew that beyond the city limits the troughs would converge, and iron\nwould be cooled, shaped and shipped.\n\nIt was ingenious, and something I'd never run across in my readings\nabout Mars. But then, I was never much of a space exploration fan.\nHowever, ingenious or not, it was a crumby trick on me, really. I\nhadn't a chance of passing through that rushing inferno outside.\n\nThat left me one way out: through the front door.\n\nHefting the wirecutter in my hand, and breathing a silent prayer, I\nmoved back to that open doorway.\n\nThings, when I peeked out, seemed no more advanced. Man and sugarfoot\nwere still clacking away at one another, neither side giving ground.\nHowever, the other men round about were showing signs of restlessness.\n\n\"Whyn't ya just blast him, Jim, and forget it?\" suggested an oldster\njust over to my left.\n\nJim, the bartender, faced the other men with a black scowl, furious\nat the interruption. \"You keep your mouth shut, Barry! You know these\nthings can understand a little English!\"\n\nThe older man, Barry, subsided with a sullen look at Jim, and I turned\nmy gaze there to see what would happen next. I'd quite overlooked the\nfact that Jim's looking toward Barry had sent his eyes in the general\ndirection of the corridor, and that I was leaning my fool head around\nthe doorway. Jim was looking right at me, his mouth wide open.\n\n\"Hey!\" he cried, leaping to his feet and pointing with such violence\nthat his chair crashed to the floor. \"He's loose!\"\n\nI took a step back, as the entire roomful of men jumped up and turned\nto face me. My mind leaped about, like a fish flung alive onto a\nskillet, trying to make some sensible decision. Should I chance\nflinging myself over that red hot river outside, or rush back to the\ndeadend of the cellar? Neither course seemed very profitable, somehow.\n\nBut my time was running out. After the first startled pause at seeing\nme there, the group came at me in a rapid scuttle, hands outstretched\nto take me.\n\nSo none of them ever saw what I saw, facing into the room. The sight\nthey missed was one which sent me diving to my left, to fall prone on\nthe corridor floor, hugging the raw stone there and clamping my eyes\nshut.\n\nI heard that terrible throbbing buzz in that bar room, and then my\nskin prickled and stung as an eight-foot segment of the wall above me\nvanished into a cloud of white sparks.\n\nWhen I at last lifted myself carefully for a look, the sugarfoot was\ngone. Gone with the collapser I'd seen it snatch up from that table\nwhen Jim's guard was down.\n\nAnd the men were gone, too. Gone with most of the wall, half the bar,\nand a large quantity of chairs and tables.\n\nA collapser is nothing to fool with.\n\nThe sugarfoot must have flicked it on and sent the blue-white beam in a\nsweeping curve that turned everything it touched into hot protons and\nelectrical energy. He'd turned it off, however, as soon as the last man\nvanished from his ken.\n\nI realized with a sick feeling of shock that a second's more energy\nwould have dissolved the back wall, and I would have been buried\nbeneath a flood of molten iron.\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nWhen I got outside, there was no sign of the sugarfoot along the\nstreet. In fact, there was no sign of anyone. Marsport, despite the\ncaloric values of the heating troughs is still pretty chilly at night.\nI gathered no one went out much, or that this was a slack night for the\nlocal merchants, because even the stores were closed, and the public\nstereovision auditorium was shut down, too.\n\nIt was eerie, walking down that rocky street, with no sound but that of\nmy durex heels smacking the ground. To left and right, dark shuttered\nwindows moved by as I advanced. My nose still felt irritated by the\ngood whiff of ozone it had inhaled when the sugarfoot cut loose with\nthe collapser, and I was rubbing the tip of it with the back of my\nwrist when I saw a figure down the street, facing toward me.\n\nIt seemed to be a man, but his figure was lost in the deep shadows\nthrown by the eye-searing glow of the distant converter. I kept moving\ntoward him, but slowed my pace. There was something in his attitude\nthat I didn't like. He was waiting there for me, I realized with a\nsmall shock. And I sensed his intentions weren't the best possible.\n\nWhile moving toward him, I started darting my eyes about me, to see if\nthere were some way of getting off the street. But the buildings were\nall side-to-side with one another, and shut tight. I could, of course,\nhurl myself through the glass front of one. But assuming I didn't brain\nmyself on the blinds in the process, what then? All these places were\nbacked by that infernal molten river. There'd be no escape. And then\nmy eyes saw something that sent brazen alarm bells clanging through my\nnervous system. In the entrance of one store, the glass curved at a\nforty-five degree angle to my line of movement, and, reflected in its\ndepths, I could see the broad avenue behind me.\n\nIt was filled with creeping figures.\n\nI spun about with an involuntary cry, and looked at them, head on. It\nwas a group of men, armed with rude weapons, mostly clubs, but a few\nglittering knives. And they were obviously after me.\n\nAs soon as they knew I'd spotted them, they left all pretense of\nstealth, and came at me in a run, brandishing their weapons.\n\nI staggered back one frightened step, then turned and ran down the\nstreet like a madman. Not one of them, however, was making a sound.\nOnly their heavy footfalls told me they were still in earnest pursuit\nas I stumbled up the street toward that solitary waiting figure in the\nshadows. It was like a nightmare; the relentless pursuers chasing one\ndown an endless avenue with no turnoff.\n\nMy ribs ached with panicky breathing, and my vision was swimming\ngiddily as I came to where the solitary figure stood. \"Here we go,\" I\nsaid to myself. \"Now he steps out and stops me. And I'm too winded to\nput up a fight.\"\n\nAs I came nearly abreast of the figure, it stepped out into the\nblue-white glow that glared from the converter. Brilliant light\ncoruscated over glassy scales as it moved out into the avenue in a\nqueer scuttling motion.\n\nThe sugarfoot! I knew it was the same one. My collapser was still\nclutched in its three-fingered hand. Blindly, I shot my arms in front\nof me to wrest the thing from its grasp, but it simply tossed the gun\ninto its other hand, and with the free hand caught me by the collar and\nheld on.\n\nThen a humming blaze filled the avenue for a split second, and I got my\nsecond whiff of ozone that night. The sugarfoot released me, and I fell\nto the street panting. I managed to lift my head, and look back toward\nwhere my pursuers had been. They were gone.\n\nI raised myself on my hands, and looked up into the scaly face of my\nrescuer, wary and alert. But the sugarfoot had lowered the collapser,\nand wasn't menacing me with it.\n\n\"Why did you kill those men?\" I asked, bewildered.\n\nIt flickered out a horrible-looking tongue that resembled a segment of\nhollow rubber tubing, and made some clacking noises. I shook my head.\nThe thing ceased making noises, and tried sign language instead. It\npointed toward where the men had been, then pointed at me.\n\n\"You mean,\" I said slowly, \"you annihilated those men simply because\nthey were after me?\"\n\nThe thing didn't change expression--I didn't really see how it could,\nwhat with its rigid crystalline structure--but it gave a slow nod. It\nseemed to have difficulty doing it, as though it weren't used to that\nparticular form of expression.\n\n\"But why?\" I said, getting to my feet and staring at the creature. \"Why\ngo to these lengths to protect me? Is there something special about me?\"\n\nAgain the ponderous nod. Then the sugarfoot pointed at me, and pointed\nat its head. I simply shook my head. It did the action again, patiently.\n\n\"Because I'm smart?\" I choked, not really thinking this was the case.\n\nThe lumpy red head moved from right to left and back to center again.\n\n\"Then what?\" I demanded.\n\nIt looked about, suddenly, then pointed to the ground and shook its\nhead again.\n\n\"Not here, you mean?\"\n\nThe sugarfoot nodded, then raised a hand and beckoned.\n\n\"You want me to come with you; is that it?\" I said.\n\nIt nodded, with less patience, and moved off a few paces. When I\ndidn't go with it, it turned to face me again, and gave its head a\nquestioning tilt.\n\n\"Because,\" I answered its unspoken question, \"I don't know if I can\ntrust you, that's why.\"\n\nIt stared at me with its wide-set eyes for a second, then pointed to\nthe empty space in the street, then to the collapser, and nodded.\n\n\"I--I should trust you because you didn't use the collapser on me?\nBecause if your motives were bad, you would already have destroyed me?\"\n\nThe sugarfoot nodded violently.\n\n\"Unh-uh!\" I said, backing off. \"Not a chance. You tell me why, and\nmaybe I'll come along. But not before.\" Even as I said it, I felt\nregret for my own irrationality. Were its intentions even the best, it\ncould certainly not prove them to me, or even demonstrate its reasons\nwith the language barrier between us.\n\nIt stood there, looking at me, apparently thinking hard. We seemed to\nbe at an impasse. I didn't want to go with it. On the other hand, I\ndidn't want it to go off and leave me with the most baffling mystery\nof my life unsolved. I had to know why it had spared me, and what it\nwanted.\n\nBut an alien, on a strange planet, with that dragonish form, and the\nshark-mouth full of teeth, not to mention a thick three-foot tail ... I\ncouldn't bring myself to trust it.\n\nAt that moment, there was a shout down the street, and a flashing\nlight. Someone was coming. Probably, I realized an instant later, the\nSecurity men from the rocket field. They had a gadget there that could\nnot only spot, but track down, any use of atomic energy in the region.\nAnd there had been, within ten minutes of each other, two such uses of\nthat all-annihilating collapser.\n\nThe sugarfoot took a step backward.\n\n\"Hold on,\" I said. \"These guys are okay. Maybe, after I get a\ntranquillizer, I'll be more in the mood for coming with you. If you'll\njust wait a moment.\"\n\nBut the sugarfoot was having none of it. It gave me an angry glance,\nthen, before I could dodge, it grabbed my arm. I went to pull away,\nthen saw that it was trying to tell me something. The fingers not\nholding my arm were indicating my wrist. It took me a second to catch\non.\n\n\"Wrist--wristwatch?\" A swift nod. \"Time of some sort?\" Another.\n\"You--You'll come for me at a later time?\" A very brief nod, then a\nsurprisingly friendly clasp of those clawlike fingers on my shoulder.\n\nThen, with a bound that took my breath away, the sugarfoot sprang\nupward from the street and landed on the rooftop of one of the nearby\nstores. It landed running, and as I watched, it reached the rear of the\nstore and took a soaring leap out over the molten river between it and\nthe next rooftop. Then it vanished into the blackness beyond the trough\nalley. I turned to await the arrival of the Security men.\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\nCharlie and the other Security Agent, whose name turned out to be\nFoster, sat stolidly listening as I recounted events since I'd last\nseen them.\n\n\"You say,\" Charlie interrupted with a frown, \"this here sugarfoot told\nyou why he didn't shoot you down?\"\n\n\"Not quite,\" I said. \"He didn't seem to have the time. But he said he'd\nsee me l--\"\n\n\"Look, Delvin, that's not what I mean. Everybody from Mars to Venus\nknows that the sugarfoots are dumb animals. So I'd like to know what\nyou're trying to hand us.\"\n\nThere was something funny in his tone. As though he were saying, not\n\"It can't be true,\" but, \"It's not supposed to be true, and that's the\nway things stay!\"\n\nI paused, considering. I'd had a hard time for a while, when I was\nfirst picked up. But I'd been able to get myself brought, by the men\nwho found me, to Charlie and Foster, after giving Charlie's name\nand describing the two. They'd identified me, and gotten me off the\nhook for the damage to that bar. It was damage possible only by a\ncollapser. And I, of course, had been picked up wearing a collapser\nholster.\n\nBut from the time I'd been left with them, there was a bothersome\nsomething about their attitude; an impatience, as though they had\nsomething to say to me, or even do to me, but had to hold off until I\nwas through.\n\n\"He told me by sign language,\" I said. \"He made a gesture, and I\ninterpreted it. Nothing baffling in that, is there?\"\n\nFoster gave me a half-lidded stare, as though suppressing anger. Then\nhe said, \"Tell me, Mister Delvin. Just what is the sign for 'I must go\nnow, but I'll see you at a later time'?\"\n\nI took a deep breath and controlled myself. \"Look, I was picked for\nthis job because I have a gift for interpretation, or deduction, or\nwhatever you want to call it.\"\n\n\"If you're such a hotshot figure-outer,\" Charlie snapped, \"how come you\ndidn't get suspicious when that bartender was forcing free drinks on\nyou? Any sap would've expected a mickey with the guy acting like that!\"\n\n\"The reason,\" I said, stiffly, hating to admit my mental weakness, \"is\nthat at that particular moment, the picture of Miss Snow White was on\nthe stereo. That's why! I--I don't function properly when there are\nwomen about.\"\n\nCharlie and Foster exchanged a look, and both shrugged: I felt a hot\nblush of embarrassment and anger burning upon my face. \"And that's the\nstory!\" I finished stubbornly.\n\nCharlie heaved himself lazily to his feet. \"What do you think, Foster?\"\n\nFoster, emulating the same lazy motion, looked thoughtful for a second,\nthen nodded. \"I think that's all we're going to get. Come on, let's\nstash him away.\"\n\n\"Stash me away?\" I cried indignantly. \"What the hell are you talking\nabout?\"\n\n\"You're going into a nice cell, buddy,\" said Charlie, an ugly smile\non his face. \"And you'll be let out when the time comes. So quit your\nbellyaching and come on. It'll be easier if you don't try to get rough.\"\n\n\"You can't arrest me,\" I said. \"I'm--or, I should be--the\nAmnesty-bearer!\"\n\nIt was as if they hadn't heard me.\n\n\"Come on, come on,\" said Foster, crooking a finger at me.\n\n\"You guys can't pull this kind of trick!\" I said. \"When Chief Baxter\nhears about this--\"\n\nCharlie and Foster threw back their heads and laughed.\n\n\"W-what's so funny?\" I asked, a dreadful inkling growing inside my mind.\n\nThe door opened and a third security man walked in. It was Chief Philip\nBaxter. He gave me a tolerant smile.\n\n\"They're laughing, Delvin,\" he said smoothly, \"because I gave the order\nfor your arrest.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe cell was of cold Martian stone, and had no window. I sat,\nmiserable, on the thin cot provided for me, and pondered all that had\nhappened to me in the last few days. None of it made the slightest\nsense to me. Not my selection by the Brain, nor my arrest by Baxter's\nmen. It was crazy!\n\nBaxter, when I'd demanded to know the reason for his duplicity, had\nmerely said, \"You've served your purpose.\" And then Charlie and\nFoster had taken me away, their collapser muzzles forming unarguable\npersuaders against my spine.\n\nI didn't even give a moment's consideration to thoughts of escape. I\nwas in a Security prison, and a maximum-security Security prison at\nthat. The door to my cell was a massive foot-thick stone which swung\ninto place on ponderous hinges, and sealed by making a half-twist\nin the circular entrance. Air was provided through vents, vents\nwhich could be closed off if the prisoner showed signs of aggressive\ntendencies. A few hours without air made most men pretty docile.\n\nI wondered how long I'd sit there before they fed me. Or if they would\nfeed me at all. Hell, no one knew I was on Mars. My last contact with\nmy regular associates had been my good-by to Marge at the office. For\nall anyone knew, I'd been arrested for anarchy, or something. I knew,\nwith a cold sinking feeling, that no one would even ask about me.\nSecurity had taken me, Security was good for the country, and Security\nnever made mistakes. Topic closed. Jery Delvin written off as an\nuninteresting memory.\n\nThere seemed to be nothing to do but think, so I did a lot of it.\n\nI noted with chagrin that they hadn't removed my belt, or socks. I\ncould, if I so desired, escape my fate by simply knotting them into\na cord, and passing one end through the overhead air grillwork and\nthe other about my neck. Maybe that was the reason why they hadn't\ntaken them. I had a distinct feeling, a served-my-purpose feeling,\nthat whether I died by my own hand or of claustrophobia made little\ndifference to Baxter and his boys.\n\nI folded my hands behind my head and sank back onto the hard cot,\npuzzling over everything that had happened to me.\n\nThe Brain selects me as the key figure in the finding of the missing\nSpace Scouts. Fine, so far. Just what my duties are, it doesn't say,\nbut I'm the man for the job, whatever it is. Okay.\n\nSo Baxter hands over the Amnesty, I get a preliminary lead from Anders,\nthe pilot of the Scouts. I take off for Mars to find the kids, who\nseem to have left of their own volition. Swell. Only, a cute blonde by\nthe unlikely name of Snow White filches the Amnesty, and nearly has me\ntossed in prison. Except that Baxter, still on my side, gets me loose.\nI take off looking for Snow, and get mickeyed in a Martian bar. Then--\n\nThen things start getting confusing.\n\nI get loose and come upon a sort of council of Earthmen, dickering with\na sugarfoot, a supposedly dumb animal, for me and my collapser.\n\nI get spotted, the men try to snatch me, and they all get vaporized by\nthe sugarfoot, who runs off. I follow, and next thing, another mob is\non my heels. Same bit with the sugarfoot. Zzzzzzurp! No more men! Only\nthis time it doesn't run off. It dallies a bit, and tries to get me to\ngo somewhere with it. Why it has suddenly decided to take me along, I\ndon't know, because it had the opportunity much earlier, when it made\nits first massacre.\n\nHowever, I decline the invitation, and, like a good boy, report all\nevents to Security. Upshot: I am stashed in a solid rock cell, possibly\nnever to emerge alive.\n\nI lay there pondering these facts. One thing seemed clear: I\ndidn't know the angles. What was Snow's angle? Or Baxter's? Or the\nsugarfoot's? Or the mob's?\n\nHell, what was mine?\n\nI snorted and sat up, rubbing my neck. I had a headache coming on,\nand it felt like the start of a migraine, an occupational hazard with\nad men. I tried rotating my head on my neck, a good relaxer for those\ntensed neck muscles. And then I noticed that I was perspiring like mad,\nand that my throat felt hot inside.\n\nWith a sick apprehension, I sprang up and thrust my nose near the grill\non the wall. Nothing. I tried poking a finger between the latticework.\nIt was stopped by a metal plate.\n\nThe air-supply grill was sealed off. In that tiny cell, I had maybe two\nhours more of breathing time. After that--Well, I wouldn't be feeling\nmy oxygen-starvation headache any more.\n\nI sat down on the cot once more and scowled at the floor. I was tired\nof puzzles, but even this didn't make sense! Why take the time and\ntrouble to smother me?\n\nA collapser could wipe me off the slate in seconds. No annoying corpus\ndelicti cluttering up the premises. Not even a bit of fingernail left,\nnothing to incriminate the murderers. So they smother me.\n\nBut why kill me, for heaven's sake? It couldn't be to keep me from\ntelling what I knew! I didn't know a damned thing. Except that Baxter,\nmotive unknown, must have left Earth immediately after I spoke to him\non that interplanetary hook-up. Or was it interplanetary? Come to think\nof it, he could've been in the next room when I talked to him. Damn. It\nwas baffling.\n\nWhy he hadn't simply told me that it was no use, and sent me back\nto Earth, I couldn't figure out. He could have made all sorts of\nreasonable excuses for my not continuing in my search for the missing\nboys, and I'd have swallowed any one of them. Instead, he locks me up,\nthrows away the key, and turns off the air supply.\n\nWhat did I know that I could communicate to people back on Earth? What\nknowledge did I have that was a menace of some sort to Security? Or, to\nbe more near the truth, to Baxter?\n\nThe only interesting fact I'd stumbled on was--\n\nBut maybe that was it: the fact that the sugarfeet were something other\nthan what Earth had claimed. That one I'd met was certainly no dumb\nanimal. He had a language; I'd heard that bartender talking to him.\nThat put him a few steps ahead of cats and dogs. Maybe a lot further.\n\nBut what difference did it make if the sugarfeet were or weren't\ndumb animals? I didn't care one way or the other. And I was pretty\nrepresentative of an Earthman, wasn't I? Who'd care, anyhow, if it\nturned out the sugarfeet were nearer human than had been supposed?\n\nWell, I knew the who, if not the why.\n\nBaxter obviously cared tremendously. Which deduction left me\napproximately nowhere.\n\nThe air seemed to be getting staler by the minute. I found I could\nbreathe better lying flat on my back, not even using enough energy to\nremain in a sitting position.\n\nMy skin was clammy with sweat from head to foot, my windpipe felt like\nsomeone had just given it a brisk toweling with a hot doormat.\n\nI thought desperately of pounding on that impervious stone door, in the\nchance that my suffocation was an over-sight on their part. But I knew\nin my heart it wasn't.\n\nI held myself on the cot, fighting that deadly tug of irrational\nemotion. If I was going to suffocate, I wanted to do it with as little\npain as possible.\n\nMy lungs, though were telling me a different story. They had that \"time\nto go up for air\" feeling, the hideous pre-strangulation hot wave that\nfloods through the ribs, begging, and then ordering, the swimmer to\nhead to the surface before his lungs rip apart.\n\nI fought the feeling, breathing faster to keep that dull nudging from\nbecoming a full-scale command. But it was harder and harder not to\nfling myself at that bare store and try, in the last few minutes of\nlife, to dig my way free with my fingertips.\n\nAnd then, with my eyes burning in my own perspiration, and tongue\nhalf-protruding between gaping lips, I felt that stinging, prickling\nsensation along my limbs.\n\nThen a blinding blaze of blue-white sparks showered me, and I jumped to\nmy feet in fright.\n\nThe wall opposite the cell door was raggedly missing, its three-foot\nslabs of granite jutting wildly into the area where their companions\nhad just been. And there was air; cold, chilling air, terribly thin to\nbreathe. But it was air, and I leaped through that gap like a madman,\nflooding my hot lungs with the elusive draughts of black Martian night.\n\nI staggered, dizzy at the sparseness of the atmosphere, and then\na tight clamp closed upon my arm and kept me from falling. A\nthree-fingered clamp.\n\nI looked into the glittering face of the sugarfoot. It had the\ncollapser in its free hand, and its eyes were locked on mine. It was\nwaiting for me to say something.\n\n\"Brother,\" I said, managing a grin, \"I would love coming with you, no\nmatter where!\"\n\nSurprisingly, it shook its dragon head, and made gestures toward my\nblouse, then an upward movement of its arms.\n\n\"You want me to take it off?\" I said, in bewilderment. \"But I'm half\nfrozen already.\"\n\nThe sugarfoot was adamant. Again it pointed to the blouse, and did that\nslip-it-over-your-head motion.\n\nI gave up fighting it. The creature was obviously not inimical to me.\nEven if it were, I thought, I owed it something for pulling me out of\nthat stone coffin.\n\nHoping pneumonia was less painful than outright suffocation, I\nobediently tugged it, loose from within my belt, and slid the thing\nover my head and off.\n\nThe sugarfoot took it from me, turned it inside-out, and held it out\nclose to my face for inspection, in the dim criss-cross lighting of\ntiny Phobos and barely larger Deimos, as they scurried across the cold\nblack sky.\n\nI stared stupidly at the inside surface of the blouse, the black one\nwhich Baxter had insisted I wear, and then I caught the glint of\nreflected moonlight where there should have been plain shirt material.\nTiny metallic filaments had been woven into the garment, too light and\nflexible for the wearer to feel them, but strong enough not to break\nwith constant flexing.\n\nI nodded, and handed the blouse back to the sugarfoot. \"I see them.\nWires,\" I said. \"But what does it mean?\"\n\nThe sugarfoot pointed toward the Security prison, which at this point\nof the topography was on the outside of the hills which surrounded\nMarsport. Security had burrowed into those hills to make themselves an\nescape-proof dungeon. Even though I was out of it, I hadn't yet, in the\nreal sense of the word, escaped. It was easily twenty below zero, and\nthe air was thin as the inside of a vacuum tube.\n\nI was dizzy, and sick, and barely able to keep from falling, but I made\nmyself ask, \"What's the blouse got to do with the prison?\"\n\nThe sugarfoot pointed to the prison, the blouse, and made a circular\ngesture with his finger.\n\n\"The prison....\" I said slowly. \"It--It tracks the shirt around!\"\n\nA nod. Then the sugarfoot turned its head and, extending that hollow\ntongue, produced a shrill piercing whistle through the vibrating tip. I\nheard a scrunching sound on the rocky hillside where we stood, and then\nthe damnedest little beast hove into view. It was about the size of a\nburro. But it had six legs, no visible head or neck, and was covered\nwith spiky hairs that seemed more like lengths of straw than anything\nelse I could think of. This ambulant bale of hay approached us, and\nhalted before the sugarfoot. The sugarfoot whistled again, and from\nsomewhere in the front--I assume it was the front--of this creature, a\nclaw-tipped tentacle wormed out through the hay, and took the blouse\nfrom the sugarfoot's hand. A third and final whistle, and the thing,\nclutching the blouse, went off down the hillside with remarkable speed,\nheading toward the open desert that lay sullenly gray beneath the\nmoonlight. It had that busy-busy-busy ant-motion to it, the front and\nrear legs on one side moving forward simultaneously with the middle leg\non the opposite side, then a swift, jerky reverse and the other trio of\nlegs moved forward, giving it a strangely graceful--awkward wriggling\ngait. But it was fast, damned fast. Within a minute, it was out of\nsight.\n\nI swayed woozily, and hung onto the sugarfoot's shoulder for support.\n\"Blazing a false trail, huh?\"\n\nIt didn't answer, but reached out for me, and swung me up into its\npowerful arms, as a man carries a child. It clacked something which\nI took to be a term of reassurance, and then, holding me tightly so\nI wouldn't get jounced to death, it took off in a leaping bound in a\ndirection at right angles to that taken by the hay-bale creature. It\njolted me a little, but the cold and lack of enough oxygen had taken\nits toll of my stamina. I passed out before the third bound.\n\nAnd when I awoke, there was warmth and air, and a comfortable bed\nbeneath me. And I was looking into the face of Snow White.\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\nI forgot I was supposed to be mad at her. Instead of chewing her out\nfor her sneak-thievery, I grasped her soft little hands, and murmured,\n\"Are you okay?\"\n\n\"Miraculously,\" she said. \"I hadn't got twenty yards into town before\nmy face and name were being blazoned on every stereo in Marsport.\nThings were a bit rough for a while.\"\n\nI propped myself up on my elbows, the better to see that lovely face,\nframed in a halo of silky pale yellow hair, and said, \"What happened?\nHow'd you escape? What's with these mobs and sugarfeet, and--And where\nare we, for pete's sake?\"\n\n\"Whoa, boy!\" she laughed, pressing me back onto the bed, her hands\nlingering on my chest for a delicious moment before she sat back again.\n\"You've been very sick, whether you know it or not. Here, take a look.\"\n\nShe picked up her handbag from the floor, took out a small mirror, and\nheld it in front of my face. I took one look, then shut my eyes. My\nface was the cheery color of porcelain, with purplish eyelids and gray\nlips.\n\n\"What hit me?\" I sighed, opening my eyes again.\n\n\"Oxygen-starvation, exposure, and near pneumonia. I thought you were\ndead when Clatclit carried you in here. You've been sleeping for nearly\nthirty-six hours.\"\n\n\"Clatclit?\" I said. \"Is that the ambient hunk of dextrose who blasted\nme out of stir?\"\n\n\"Let's not be colorful,\" said Snow, deprecatingly. \"You owe your life\nto him, you know.\"\n\n\"I know,\" I said. \"That was the ad man in me coming through. But look,\nmy mind's a whirlpool of confusion. Could you please tell me what's\nbeen going on here, anyhow?\"\n\n\"Lie back and rest,\" said Snow, \"and I will.\"\n\nI burrowed deeper into the warm coverlet, sighed, and kept my eyes on\nher lovely face. In the midst of her discourse, I even sneaked a hand\nout and laid it gently over her own. It was smartly slapped, without\nrancor, and I withdrew it from active duty for a while.\n\n\"Well, first thing, I'd like to apologize for that dirty trick I pulled\nback on the _Valkyrie_,\" Snow said. My heart turned over, and I felt\nan idiot grin of forgiveness spreading across my ghastly features. I\nfound it quite impossible to stay angry with the girl. As I've said,\nsomething happens to my brain when around women.\n\n\"Accepted,\" I croaked.\n\n\"I knew that you'd have no trouble getting away from those Security men\nI sent,\" she said smilingly.\n\n\"Then why did you send them?\" I asked.\n\n\"To keep them from asking me any questions,\" she said, with a small\nshrug. \"For all I knew, they were expecting a man with the Amnesty.\nHowever, knowing that just having it carried a lot of weight, I gave\nthem the order to pick you up as soon as they approached me at the\ncustoms booth.\"\n\n\"And if they hadn't believed me?\" I complained.\n\n\"Well,\" she said carefully, \"I suppose I'd have sent them a note, or\nsomething, telling them to release you.\"\n\n\"Thanks for the kind thought,\" I muttered.\n\nSnow ignored my minor irritation, and went blithely on.\n\n\"My next move was to go to the Port Authority, and find out just where\nthe _Phobos II_ was berthed before takeoff. I thought that Ted might\nhave left me a clue of some sort.\"\n\n\"You sound as if he were expecting you to traipse up here after him,\" I\nsaid, dubiously.\n\n\"He wouldn't count on my coming, if that's what you mean. But Ted's a\ngood kid. I've practically had to raise him myself. He knew I'd worry\nif I didn't hear from him. He couldn't know, of course, that IS would\nsend forged letters to the relatives of the missing boys. So I assumed\nthat, if he had the chance, he'd leave a clue of some kind for me, in\ncase I did come.\"\n\n\"An assurance of sorts, you mean?\"\n\n\"Something like that. Like 'I'm okay, Snow, so don't worry,' or some\nsuch message. So that's what I looked for at the rocket berth.\"\n\n\"Just a minute,\" I interrupted. \"I used to be a boy, once, myself, and\nwhile I didn't have any sisters of my own, I knew a lot of buddies\nwho did. The last thing in the world they'd expect would be for their\nsister to follow them into danger! Hell, they'd feel like sissies if\nthey had to count on a sister for aid.\"\n\n\"I--\" Snow hesitated. \"I'm not what you'd call the typical sister,\nJery.\"\n\n\"Oh?\"\n\nShe blushed prettily. \"When you have to raise a brother, you have to\nlearn a lot of things, if you're going to bring him up fairly normally.\nI had to teach him to play ball, to box, to ski, to--Well, I was more\nlike a father to him than anything. So Ted, knowing my more belligerent\nside, would just about figure I'd come storming up here to find him.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" I pondered aloud. \"If you and Ted have this friendly\nrelationship, why the hell would he put you to all this trouble? It\nseems like a lousy thing on his part to go wandering off without a\nword.\"\n\n\"It would be,\" Snow agreed, \"unless there was a mighty important reason\nfor his going. And it wasn't without a word.\"\n\n\"Then you did find a message?\" I exclaimed.\n\nShe nodded. \"After a few minutes' inspection of the berth, I found it\nscratched onto one of the supporting beams.\"\n\n\"Funny IS didn't spot it,\" I remarked.\n\n\"It's in our special _code_, silly!\" Snow said. \"To anyone else, it'd\nlook like hen scratches.\"\n\n\"Just what is this code of yours?\" I asked, curious.\n\nSnow looked at me a moment, frowning.\n\n\"I'll carry the secret to my grave.\" I said generously.\n\nShe laughed, then, and said, \"All right, Jery. Just a second.\"\n\nFrom her handbag, she took out a small address book and a pencil, found\na blank sheet at the back, and drew the following diagrams:\n\n     A | D | G\n     ---------\n     B | E | H\n     ---------\n     C | F | I\n\n\n     . | . | .\n     J | M | P\n     ---------\n    .K | N.| Q.\n     ---------\n     L | O | R\n     .   .   .\n\n\n      \\ S /\n     V \\ /T\n       / \\\n      / U \\\n\n        .\n      \\ W /\n    . Z\\ /X .\n       / \\\n      / Y \\\n        .\n\n\"See?\" she said. \"It's very simple, really. You just remember the\nposition of each letter in its portion of the diagram, and draw\nthe corresponding shape instead of the letter; a square for E,\nsquare-plus-dot for N, an L-shape for G, same with a dot for P, an\ninverted V-shape for U--\"\n\n\"I get it,\" I said. \"Gad, it looks positively runic when you write that\nway.\"\n\nSnow put the address book back into her bag. \"So that's what I found\nscratched onto that supporting beam. The message said, simply: SNOW\nI AM ALL RIGHT FIND CLATCLIT THE SUGARFOOT AND HE WILL EXPLAIN.\"\n\nI stared at her. \"Not a very easy task he set, was it?\"\n\n\"Nothing easier, as it turned out,\" she said airily. \"Of course,\" she\nadmitted, when I gave her a cold stare, \"I didn't know it was easy, at\nthe time. I was actually pretty much bewildered. I mean, I thought,\nlike everybody else, that sugarfeet were like cats or dogs.\"\n\n\"So how'd you accomplish locating him?\" I said.\n\nShe grinned. \"I went into Marsport, went up to the first one I\nsaw--they're as common as pigeons around the town--and said, feeling\nlike a damned fool, 'Clatclit?' Instead of the blank-eyed stare of\nuncomprehending nonintelligence which I expected for my efforts, the\nthing looked to left and right, I guess to insure that no Earthmen were\nwatching, then beckoned to me and started waddling off. Still feeling\nlike an idiot, I followed it. It led me back toward the airstrip. For a\nwhile, I had the stupid impression that it was going to point me out\nthe spot from which the boys had vanished, and that I'd be right back\nwhere I started.\"\n\n\"So what happened?\" I demanded impatiently.\n\n\"Back of the berth where the _Phobos II_ had been, there was a slope,\nthe beginning of the hills that surround Marsport. I followed the\nsugarfoot partway up the slope to a sort of cave mouth, and it gestured\nthat I should go inside.\"\n\n\"Okay, okay,\" I prodded. \"You went inside, and--\"\n\nSnow shook her head. \"No, I didn't. If _you_ were on a strange planet,\nwould you go into a cave after a red-scaled creature that looked like\na pint-sized dragon?\" She added, matter-of-factly, \"Besides, there\nwas a sign in front of the cave mouth, telling Earth people that it\nwas forbidden to enter any of the many Martian caves that lay on\nthe hillsides. It seems they're old volcanic tunnels, and wind like\nlabyrinths into the planet. Some of the earlier colonists vanished\nthere, you know.\"\n\n\"Ye gods!\" I growled. \"What did you do, then? Leave the sugarfoot\nstanding at the cave mouth like an untipped bellboy?\"\n\n\"More or less,\" she admitted. \"It seemed to want to take me with it,\nbut I begged off as politely as possible, and went back into town.\nOnly, when I got there, the first thing I saw was my own picture on the\nstereo screen outside the public auditorium.\"\n\n\"With shoot-to-kill commands ringing into the street,\" I nodded. \"I\nsuppose you swooned away on the pavement?\"\n\nSnow gave me a black look. \"Mister Delvin, I do not swoon!\"\n\nI shrugged. \"Just as well. Marsport has no pavement, anyhow.\"\n\n\"Ho ho,\" she said. \"Do you want to hear the rest of this, or not?\"\n\n\"Sorry,\" I said. \"Go on.\"\n\n\"Well, there didn't seem to be anything else to do then, but to get out\nof town, fast. I hadn't been spotted, yet. I guess my picture had only\njust gotten onto the screen. So I hurried back to where that cave mouth\nwas, and the sugarfoot was still there, waiting for me.\"\n\n\"He does sound like an untipped bellboy at that,\" I remarked.\n\nSnow ignored this, and continued. \"Well, I went into the cave with\nhim. After all, getting eaten by a dragon has no worse end result than\ngetting hit with a collapser-bolt.\"\n\n\"The process is a bit more painful, though,\" I said.\n\n\"I took that chance,\" Snow said. \"I had to. So I followed it for what\nseemed miles of slippery tubular tunnels--knowing, and it scared me\nstiff, that I'd never find my way out without a map--and it led me\nhere, where I met Clatclit.\"\n\n\"And where, by the way,\" I said, \"are we?\"\n\n\"Darned if I know,\" said Snow. \"We're at present in a room off one of\nthose tunnels I mentioned. The sugarfeet have been wonderful, helping\nyou. Especially in bringing water for you; they're deathly scared of\nthe stuff.\"\n\n\"I would be, too, in their case,\" I said. \"It'd be like toting around a\ncarboy of sulphuric acid.\"\n\n\"Well, anyhow, you're alive,\" she said, \"and that's something. But as\nfor Ted--\" her voice faltered.\n\nI looked up, startled. \"He's not dead?\"\n\n\"D--? Oh, no. At least I hope not!\" she said. \"I only meant that,\nwhile I've located Clatclit, I can't figure out either his gestures or\nhis--pardon the expression--words.\"\n\n\"He understands English, even if his vocal apparatus can't form it,\" I\nsaid. \"Why don't you just ask him yes-and-no questions? He nods easily\nenough.\"\n\n\"I did that,\" she sighed. \"I asked if Ted were alive, and he nodded.\nThen I asked to be brought to him, and he spread his hands. I said,\n'Does that mean you don't know where Ted is?' He seemed stymied; he\nnodded, then shook his head immediately. You figure that one out!\"\n\nI tried hard. Nothing happened inside my head. It was filled with the\npicture of Snow, her lips slightly parted, her violet eyes anxious, her\nhair like a misty golden corolla.\n\n\"I can't. Not with you around. Remember?\" I said, helplessly.\n\nShe stood up from my bedside. \"Then close your eyes, or something,\nJery! I'll stand here, quiet as a mouse.\"\n\n\"Well,\" I said, doubtfully, \"I'll try.\"\n\nI shut my eyes and tried to convince myself that Snow wasn't anywhere\nabout. I couldn't do it.\n\n\"No use,\" I sighed, opening my eyes again. \"I can feel you here.\"\n\n\"I guess the only thing to do is send Clatclit in to see you, and stay\noutside myself,\" she said.\n\n\"Good idea,\" I said. \"Send him around with a lunch, though, will you?\nI've gone all hollow inside.\"\n\nSnow smiled, and left through a rocky archway.\n\nI lay there looking about me. With Snow in the room, I hadn't paid\nattention to my less stimulating environment. Now I found myself gazing\nover dark crimson walls, smooth and glossy looking. The room was just\na bubble in the rock, about ten feet in diameter, with an artificially\nleveled floor.\n\nLight came from a narrow ridge that ran around the walls near the top,\na sort of ledge covered with fuzzy stuff that glowed pallidly white.\n\nI threw back the coverlet and eased myself to my feet, and was grateful\nto find my trousers folded neatly upon a small hump of rock that\nprobably served a sugarfoot as a stool. I slipped them on hurriedly,\nthen investigated the stuff on that ledge.\n\nIt seemed to be a kind of crumbly dry fungus, not unlike the stuff\nfound in dead logs on Earth, the phosphorescent foxfire. But it was a\nlot brighter, and also gave off a detectable amount of heat, too, which\nexplained why I wasn't still turning blue.\n\nI left off looking at the heaps of fungi, and went to the archway for\na look. Beyond the room, the cave dissolved into a riot of diverging\ntunnels. I decided to stay put, rather than risk getting myself\nentombed in some pahoehoeal cavity, and succumbing to the fate Baxter\nhad planned for me.\n\nAnd besides, those tunnels were black as oil, further off from the\nchamber I was in. My feet might find me a quick shortcut to the center\nof the planet, in that treacherous gloom.\n\nSugarfeet, I decided, could either see in the dark, or else they\ncarried a handful of that white-glowing fungus with them when they went\nfor a stroll.\n\nI went back to the cot, and sat down to wait for Clatclit's appearance,\npassing the time by struggling back into my durex boots. I felt a bit\nmore competent, once trousered and shod, than I had felt while lying\nbeneath that coverlet in my shorts. A man without his pants is only\nhalf a man, somehow.\n\nFrom the corridor, there came a series of sharp, regular clicks,\nand then Clatclit waddled in. When not going full speed, in that\ngravity-defying bound of theirs, the sugarfeet moved rather clumsily,\nlike an old sailor rocking down the street on legs trained to fight a\nrolling deck. I think it was the tail's weight that accounted for that\nlumbering gait. It was fully as long as the legs, and nearly as thick,\nexcept where it dwindled at the end to a solitary prismatic red spike.\nI rather judged that that four-inch crystalline dagger came in handy\nduring a fight.\n\nClatclit made a gesture with both hands, and clacked something at me.\nHis attitude and inflection were unmistakeable.\n\nI gave him the Earth equivalent of the gesture, raising my right hand\nin a sort of lazy wave. \"Hello, yourself,\" I said. \"Snow seems to be\nhaving trouble communicating with you.\"\n\nClatclit nodded, and seated himself on that stool.\n\n\"What's this about her brother Ted?\" I went on. \"She asked if you knew\nwhere he was, and got a yes-no answer.\"\n\nThe nod again.\n\n\"Do you know where he's at?\" I persisted.\n\nClatclit made the same yes-no motion with his nubbly head that Snow had\ndescribed. I thought it over.\n\n\"You know, _in a way_, where he is, but not _specifically_?\"\n\nViolent nods, three of them.\n\n\"Ah, so that's it!\" I said. \"Let's see. Can you take us to him?\"\n\nThe yes-no business again.\n\n\"You can take us to a point, but no further, maybe?\"\n\nThe violent triple nod.\n\n\"Is there danger?\"\n\nThree nods.\n\n\"To you?\"\n\nHeadshake.\n\n\"To me and Snow, then?\"\n\nHeadshake.\n\n\"Ah! To _Ted_.\"\n\nNods.\n\n\"How about his companions? Are they in danger too?\"\n\nYes.\n\n\"From whom?\" I said, forgetting our limitations.\n\nDisgusted stare.\n\n\"Oh, yeah, that's right. Uh ... from Baxter?\"\n\nA rocking of the head from side to side. This was a new one. I wrinkled\nup my forehead, puzzling it out.\n\n\"Baxter's a danger in general, you mean, but that's not the danger you\nmeant, right?\"\n\nNods again.\n\n\"Okay, then, let's see who's left.... Danger from Earthmen, like those\nmobs who came after me?\"\n\nNegative.\n\n\"Surely not danger from me or Snow?\"\n\nNegative.\n\n\"From--from you Martians?\" I choked, bewildered.\n\nThe head rocked from side to side.\n\n\"Danger.... Danger from sugarfeet?\"\n\nA very violent negative.\n\n\"But from _Martians_?\" I queried, blinking.\n\nA slow, positive nod.\n\n\"But there are no Martians but you sugarfeet. Unless--\" An icy cold\nhand grabbed my adrenal glands and squeezed, hard. \"The Ancients!\" I\ngasped, in horror.\n\nA triple yes.\n\n\"Then they're not extinct!\"\n\nA disgusted stare.\n\nI realized he couldn't answer till I rephrased that one, or I'd be\nstuck with wondering if he meant yes, they are, or yes, they aren't.\n\"Are they extinct?\" I said.\n\nHeadshake.\n\n\"And they've got the boys!\"\n\nNod.\n\n\"And they're inimical to man, in some way!\"\n\nViolent negative.\n\nI stared, confused, into Clatclit's lizardy eyes.\n\n\"They--they aren't dangerous to man?\"\n\nThe sideways rocking motion.\n\n\"They're a danger to some men--Baxter's men!\"\n\nA nod, but with a kind of hesitation about it.\n\n\"But also to the boys?\" I marvelled.\n\nThe yes-no motion.\n\n\"Under certain conditions, they're a danger to the boys!\"\n\nYes.\n\n\"These conditions; do they have anything to do with Baxter?\"\n\nYes.\n\n\"Hmmm....\" I leaned back on my hands on the cot, and studied Clatclit's\nface, thinking hard. \"Could it be that these Ancients want something\nwith regard to Baxter, but that the boys' safety is the price of it?\"\n\nA jump up from the stool, a laughably Earthlike clap of the hands, and\na triple series of very positive nods. Clatclit sat down again, a much\nhappier sugarfoot than when he'd entered.\n\n\"But,\" I protested, \"Baxter, from my last contact with him, isn't the\nsort who'd care about the boys, right?\"\n\nNods.\n\n\"Well, then, for pete's sake,\" I protested loudly, \"over whose heads\nare the Ancients holding the safety of the boys?\"\n\nClatclit extended a ruddy talon directly at me, and then aimed it\ntoward the corridor outside.\n\n\"Me and Snow?\" I cried, standing up. \"They're trying to force me and\nSnow to do something for them, and making the boys' safety the price of\nit. Why, that's--that's criminal!\"\n\nIn my rage, I'd taken a step toward Clatclit, not even thinking of the\nfact that his crystalline constitution would be an easy match for my\nfists. Genially, though, Clatclit leaned back on the stool, widened his\nalready wide eyes, and, pointing two index fingers at his chest, shook\nhis head from side to side.\n\n\"What?\" I said, not getting it. Then, \"Oh, I see. It's not your fault\nwhat the Ancients have done. Yeah, you're right. Sorry, Clatclit.\"\n\nHe shrugged off the apology, and waited for more of my investigative\nmonologue.\n\nI dropped back to sit on the edge of the cot, and let him wait a\nwhile, while I tried to figure the whole mess out. Then I remembered\nsomething, and looked up at him.\n\n\"Clatclit, back in Marsport, when I first met you, I asked why I had\nbeen chosen, and you indicated that you'd tell me later. Why was I\nchosen?\"\n\nClatclit just stared, uncertainly.\n\n\"You know what I mean. Why was I the one you didn't blast with that\ncollapser? And why'd you go off without me the first time, but want to\ntake me along the second?\"\n\nA very disgusted stare.\n\nI slowed down and fed him questions one at a time.\n\n\"Back at that bar, you blasted the other men, then left without me.\nWhy?\"\n\nClatclit pointed to himself, then to his cranium, then to me, then made\na palms-down hand-spreading gesture.\n\n\"You ... thought ... I ... negation--You thought I'd been blasted, too!\nExcept that I'd flattened out behind that wall, and you couldn't see me\nbehind the remaining bottom section. You originally meant to get me out\nof there alive?\"\n\nNods, vigorous.\n\n\"And you thought you'd goofed with the collapser, and gotten me, too!\"\n\nNods.\n\n\"So what happened in the street? How'd you happen to stick around?\"\n\nThe talon went to his earhole, then he spread his hands wide, in a\ngesture of \"many-ness,\" and waited hopefully.\n\n\"You heard a lot of--what? Oh! You heard those men coming up the\nstreet, and stuck around to see what was up. But I didn't hear them,\nand I was closer. In fact, they were sneaking after me.\"\n\nClatclit pointed to his ears and nodded, then indicated mine and shook\nhis head.\n\nI got it then. Supersensitivity. It made sense. Just as man's ears,\naccustomed to use in air, are even more receptive to sounds in a\ndenser medium, as, for instance, underwater, where sound waves are\nmore powerful; so the sugarfeet's ears, built for use in the rarefied\nMartian atmosphere, could hear all the better in the heavier air of\nMarsport.\n\n\"Okay, so you heard them, saw me, and came to the rescue. Fine. Now,\nthe big question: Why? What is so special about me, Clatclit?\"\n\nHe stood up and made the same strange gesture he'd made the night on\nVon Braun Street. Alternate pointing to his head, then to me.\n\nThe \"me\" part was easy enough, but the other.... I tried a series of\nlikely meanings.\n\n\"That motion to your head, Clatclit. You mean I'm the head of\nsomething, the investigation, for instance?\"\n\nNegative.\n\n\"I'm intelligent?\"\n\nA pause, then the yes-no motion.\n\n\"You mean I am, but that's the wrong answer. Hmmm. Very tactful of you,\nClatclit. You could have given me a no on that one.\"\n\nClatclit showed a friendly array of deadly-looking teeth. I interpreted\nthis as an evidence of camaraderie, so I just grinned back.\n\n\"Okay, Clatclit. Let's see. It has nothing to do with my brain power?\"\n\nA wild light came into his eyes, and he seemed ready to crack out of\nhis glittering pelt, so agitated did he become. Apparently, I'd hit on\nsomething, but he didn't know what sort of signal to make.\n\n\"I'm getting warm?\" I said.\n\nClatclit stared, and I realized that, even knowing and understanding\ncolloquial English, he might still have missed a few of the slangier\nexpressions.\n\n\"That is,\" I said, \"I'm close to the answer?\"\n\nNod.\n\n\"Something to do with brain power?\"\n\nVigorous nod.\n\n\"Mine?\"\n\nNegative.\n\n\"Baxter's?\"\n\nNegative.\n\n\"Anyone's?\"\n\nI got the yes-no and a climactic shrug. Clatclit was apparently stuck\nfor a response.\n\nI tried to figure it out. Brain power, but not mine, not really\nanyone's, and yet, in a way, someone's. Then I jumped up and faced him,\nelated.\n\n\"The Brain! The composite brain of International Cybernetics!\"\n\nClatclit emitted something that sounded very much like a sigh of\nrelief, and nodded.\n\nI thought back to his head-then-me gesture. \"Then you mean I was\nrescued because I was the man chosen by the Brain?\"\n\nThree brisk nods.\n\nNow I was really confused. I shook my head at Clatclit, and said, \"I\ngive up, friend. I'm out of questions you can answer.\"\n\nHe gave me a curious look, an expectant look.\n\n\"The only question I can think of is 'Why should Mars be interested in\nme just because I was selected by the Brain back on Earth?' And that's\na tough one to do in pantomime.\"\n\nClatclit rose up proudly on tiptoe, as if stubbornly denying the slur\nI'd cast on his miming abilities. He looked hurt, and I felt like a\ncrumb.\n\n\"Okay, friend. Try. But I don't guarantee I'll get it.\"\n\nClatclit stood a moment in thought, then pointed upward.\n\n\"Up? Out? Above?\" I said. All received negatives. \"It's no use,\nClatclit, I can't--Oh, all right, once more. Uh ... away up?\"\n\nNod.\n\n\"Earth?\" I said, excitedly.\n\nNod.\n\n\"Well, what about it?\" I said.\n\nClatclit pointed up to Earth, then to me, and shook his head. Then he\npointed down, to Mars, I guessed by association, and to me again. This\ntime he nodded.\n\n\"Earth-me-no. Mars-me-yes,\" I said mechanically. \"Earth-no-_what_?\"\n\nTalon to head.\n\n\"Earth-me-no brain?\" I choked out. \"The Brain did not select me?\"\n\nSide-to-side motion.\n\n\"Not exactly? Well, then--No, that's crazy!\"\n\nClatclit looked a question.\n\nI laughed wearily and sank back onto the cot. \"All I get, chum, is the\nridiculous impression that Mars was behind the Brain's selecting me\nback on Earth--\"\n\nI sat bolt upright, slightly stunned.\n\nClatclit was nodding.\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\nAn hour later, when Clatclit had gone off to do whatever it is that\nsugarfeet do when they're not playing charades with Earthmen, I joined\nSnow in a so-so luncheon she'd been able to put together with the help\nof a few of our dragonish friends. It seemed to be mostly a species of\nwatery tumble-weed, plus a smattering of rubbery white cubes that tried\nhard to taste like mushrooms, but failed. I was trying to be light and\ncasual.\n\n\"We may be poisoned, you know,\" I remarked, chewing valiantly on a\nmouthful of the stuff.\n\n\"It's quicker than starving,\" she observed, continuing to eat. \"If we\ndon't eat, we're sure to die, but--\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah, I know. If we do, we've got a fifty-fifty chance of\nsurvival. Too bad you don't carry sandwiches in that all-purpose\nhandbag of yours.\"\n\n\"I do,\" she said, calmly. \"But they're all enjoyably gone, thank you. I\ncouldn't wait forever for you to come out of your coma.\"\n\n\"Thanks loads,\" I muttered, chomping doggedly on a stubborn white cube,\nand wishing I didn't have to tell her what I knew.\n\n\"So tell me more about what Clatclit said,\" she urged, washing down her\nalien meal with a cupped rock filled with clear but alkaline water.\n\nI shrugged, and let the rest of the vegetation sit where it was. Until\nI grew a lot hungrier, it was safe from my alimentary system for a\nspell.\n\n\"As I see it, Baxter is a menace to the Ancients. They, as a\nself-protective gesture, decided to get an Earthman up here who could\nfind the fact of their existence, and make it known to Earth. Then a\nmeeting between Earth and Mars can be arranged, and we can come to some\nsort of peaceful co-existence. Right now, Baxter's in the dastardly\nposition of being able to destroy the Ancients with no one back home\neven knowing there was anyone to destroy, see?\"\n\n\"All but how they got hold of you.\"\n\n\"They exerted some kind of influence--heaven only knows what kind of\ntechnology they possess--and it triggered the Brain, back on Earth,\ninto selecting me. Then the sugarfeet, who are, by the way, not\nservants of the ancients, but another distinct race, were used as\ngo-betweens. First one to spot me got the hand-painted ashtray, or\nsomething. Who knows? But anyhow, they selected me, and--\"\n\n\"Jery,\" said Snow, crinkling up her brow, \"how did they know that you\neven existed?\"\n\n\"I guess I could have put that more clearly; they didn't know there was\na _me_, a Jery Delvin. But they knew what qualifications such a man\nmust have, and so they influenced the Brain to choose such a man when\nSecurity tried to find a solution to the mystery of the missing Scouts.\"\n\n\"Who are missing only in order to create a mystery so that the IS\npeople would use the Brain to select the man whom the Martians had\ngimmicked the Brain to fake.\" Snow shook her head, and shut her eyes.\n\"It's got my head going in circles, Jery!\"\n\nI grinned at her. \"Okay. We'll take it from the top. Baxter, for\nreasons yet unknown, is a menace to the ancients. In a manner yet\nunknown, also. Their plight must come to the attention of the peoples\nof Earth. With me so far?\"\n\nShe nodded impatiently.\n\n\"Okay, then. So what would make the people back home sit up and take\nnotice of little old Mars? Well, how about swiping the Space Scouts?\nIt's a great plan, really. Not only are Earthmen suckers for a child\nin trouble, but these particular children are representatives of every\ncivilized nation on our planet. So they are swiped.\"\n\n\"Jery....\" Snow tried to interrupt.\n\n\"I know. The kids left of their own free will. I'll get to that in a\nminute.\"\n\nShe bit her lip and kept still, and I went on.\n\n\"Baxter, sensing the hand of the Ancients in this, makes a good\ncountermove. He keeps the Earth people under the impression that all is\nwell with the kids. This, of course, cannot go on for too damned long;\nhe's got to find those kids and fast. So, unwittingly following the\nplan set up by the ancients, he feeds the known data into the Brain.\nHowever, they've geared the Brain to react to that particular data by\nselecting a man who will not conform to Baxter's standards--that is,\na man who would have assisted Baxter's race-destruction plan--but one\nwho will be able to size up the situation and act on it in a manner\nbeneficial to the Martians.\"\n\n\"How can you be so sure of this?\" Snow demanded.\n\n\"I'm not, for pete's sake!\" I snapped. \"Remember, I had to dredge all\nthis information out of Clatclit by tortuous questioning. A lot of it I\nhad to conjecture, to fill the gaps. But hell, it fits, doesn't it?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Snow said, contritely.\n\n\"Okay, okay,\" I said, relenting. \"Pardon me for biting your head off.\nWhere was I?\"\n\n\"Acting beneficial to the ancient Martians.\"\n\n\"Ummm. Yeah, okay. So I'm picked. Baxter is a little surprised when I\nshow up, since I just don't look the race-annihilating type, I guess,\nbut he has to follow what the Brain selected, since he has no other way\nof getting to those missing kids. Still with me? Okay. However, unknown\nto even Baxter, there is a third contingent at work: Neo-Martians.\"\n\n\"Those men who tried to kill you,\" said Snow.\n\n\"Right. These are the characters who want to team with the Martians\nagainst Earth, and make this planet the ruling one in the solar system.\"\n\n\"I don't understand their motivation at all.\"\n\n\"It's--Well, it's a little like the feelings of the early colonists\nin New England toward King George. They're off here on a new planet,\nbut they're still paying taxes to Earth, and--At any rate, they want\nto be a separate country. Not all the Neo-Martians feel this way, just\na disgruntled few. But it's always those few groaners who seem to run\nthings, because the other people, in their neutral way, don't take any\naction against them.... Hell, I don't want this turning into a lecture\non political science. Let me go on.\n\n\"When the news hits the stereos that a girl with a forged Amnesty is\non the loose in Marsport, these people show a lot of sense. Since the\ncustoms office wouldn't let you off Earth with such a thing, and the\ncustoms people here wouldn't have let you bring one onto Mars, they\nknow it must be the real McCoy. But if real, why this to-do about\nshooting to kill? Obviously, you've taken the Amnesty from the real\nperson who should have it. Now, they don't know me from Adam, but they\nput the word out all over town to keep watch for anyone who might be\nthe actual Amnesty-bearer. I qualify.\"\n\n\"How?\" Snow asked, narrowing her eyes with interest.\n\n\"First, I'm a stranger. Secondly, though not in a Security uniform,\nI'm toting a collapser, which means--unless I have the approval of\nIS--the death penalty. I've carried it openly, so they know I haven't\nstolen it anyplace. Okay, I'm a stranger who has an in with Security, a\ncollapser on my belt, and the word is out that an Amnesty-bearer minus\nthe Amnesty is in town. What would you do if you were a Neo-Martian and\nI walked into your bar?\"\n\n\"I'd slip you a mickey,\" Snow said sweetly.\n\n\"Uh.... Yeah, okay.\" I muttered, declining an urge to snarl something\nback at her. Besides, she had a cruel blow coming.\n\n\"But why did they want you?\" Snow demanded.\n\n\"Honey--\" I said, before I could catch myself. But she hadn't flinched,\nso I decided to let the appelation stand.\"--they don't know the\nScouts are missing! As far as Marsport is concerned, those kids took\noff in the _Phobos II_, see? So what do you suppose they decide the\nAmnesty-bearer is after?\"\n\nSnow's eyes widened into violet pools, and she exclaimed, finally\ngetting the point, \"Them!\"\n\n\"At last a light dawns in that lovely skull,\" I sighed. \"They figured\nI was here to round up the rebels among the Neo-Martians and stash\nthem in that lousy prison I was blasted free of. So they lock me in\nthat cellar, and have a meeting to decide what's to be done. Only,\nClatclit, knowing I'm the guy the ancients have been waiting for, can't\nlet these men keep me. So he goes to the meeting, too.\"\n\n\"But wouldn't the rebels be surprised at a sugarfoot--\"\n\n\"Dearest girl, the rebels are well aware of the fact that sugarfeet are\nmore than just dumb animals. Clatclit tells me that they're counting on\nthe sugarfeet for support, if it even comes to open battle. Why do you\nsuppose that bartender went to the trouble of learning that gosh-awful\nclacketty language of theirs?\"\n\n\"But why would the sugarfeet join with them?\" Snow asked. \"Aren't they\nfriendly, on the neutral side?\"\n\n\"Unh-uh,\" I said. \"Not in the way you mean. The sugarfeet, from\nplanetary sympathies, are on the side of the Ancients. The Neo-Martians\nwere anti-Earth, hence, anti-Baxter. So Plan A of the Ancients was a\njoining of forces between sugarfeet and rebel Neo-Martians. It was\na slim chance, but they needed allies. Clatclit tells me that this\nthing's been growing for nearly a year, now. But a few weeks ago, what\nhappens? Up to Mars come these kids, who are not only good emotional\ncontacts with Earth, but with all the powerful nations. The ancients\nimmediately scrap the first scheme, and switch to Plan B, the one we're\ncurrently enmeshed in.\"\n\n\"So that's why Clatclit was dickering for the collapser at that meeting\nyou eavesdropped on!\" Snow exclaimed.\n\n\"Sure,\" I said. \"The rebels wanted that collapser for purposes of\nduplication. Its mechanism is one of Security's best-kept secrets. Only\nnow, the Ancients don't want to help the rebel cause, so Clatclit was\ninstructed to get that thing from them at all costs. He did. You know\nthe cost.\"\n\nSnow shuddered. \"All those men--poof! Just like that!\"\n\n\"Honey, this is war,\" I sighed sadly. \"And you and I are the key\nfigures in it, whether we like it or not.\"\n\n\"I think I'm all clear except on the one point: Why did the boys leave\nthe _Phobos II_ willingly?\"\n\n\"Male children, especially that brother of yours, love intrigue and\nadventure and secret codes. Clatclit and his ruby-red friends, knowing\nthey'd pique the kids' curiosity, let them know that they were more\nthan dumb animals. This, being in direct conflict with all they'd been\ntaught back on Earth, put them in the enviable position of being 'in\nthe know.' And kids are quick to pick up new tongues, too. I have no\ndoubts that within three hours those kids knew more of the sugarfoot\nlanguage than I'll learn in a lifetime. Here, they were told, was their\nchance to be heroes. Plan B was told to them, and the part they must\nplay in it. What kid wouldn't go along with a chance to take part in\na real-life adventure? And so, after leaving the evidence that they'd\napparently vanished in space--Clatclit tells me this was one of the\nboys' idea; nice kids we grow on Earth!--leaving this baffling trail,\nthey tramped off after the sugarfeet into the cave, like the happy\nyoungsters following the Pied Piper.\"\n\nI slowed down. This was the part I didn't want to say.\n\n\"And?\" Snow said, sensing my distress, and going tense.\n\n\"And they wound up neatly jailed by the Ancients,\" I said. \"The\nAncients had made sure to select a man--me--that could be coerced by\nthreats to those poor kids.\"\n\n\"You mean if you don't do what they want...?\" Snow said, but couldn't\ncomplete the sentence.\n\n\"The kids pay,\" I finished for her. \"So, tell me, lady, what's my move?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" she said, kind of startled, as if just beginning to\nrealize the desperation of our situation. \"I'm not sure who's right or\nwrong in this, Jery.\"\n\n\"Neither am I!\" I said bitterly. \"Baxter's a stinker, but he does\nrepresent Earth, of which I'm currently in favor. The rebels may be\nviolent, but they have a few points in their favor, too. And the\nAncients--\"\n\nSnow looked at me, expectantly. \"The Ancients?\"\n\n\"Them I hate,\" I said suddenly. \"I don't like their slip-and-slide\nloyalties, Snow. They were the friends of the rebels, sure--until they\nthought of a better plan. Then the rebels were calmly forgotten. Or\nvaporized, when necessary. Right now, they're on my side, what with\nordering my escape, and protecting me from Baxter. But it's only for so\nlong as I serve their ends. Then it's good-by, Jery Delvin!\"\n\n\"Then--\" Snow arose, a slim hand going to her throat \"--we don't know\nfor sure if the boys are alive!\"\n\nI shook my head, solemnly. \"We don't know it at all.\"\n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\nClatclit came lumbering into the chamber, and paused to survey the\nremnants of our meal. He pointed to me, then to Snow, then made the\npalms-down outward gesture and looked questioningly.\n\n\"Yeah,\" I said. \"We're finished, Clatclit. Thanks.\"\n\nHe nodded, then beckoned to me, and pointed toward the tunneled gloom\nbeyond the archway.\n\n\"Come with you?\" I said. \"Come where?\"\n\nHe pointed down.\n\n\"Downstairs?\" I asked.\n\nFurious glare.\n\nIt was nearly impossible to think, with Snow sitting right there across\nfrom me, but luckily my memory came through with what that gesture had\nmeant the last time he'd used it.\n\n\"Mars?\" I said softly.\n\nSide-to-side motion of the head.\n\n\"Something like Mars. The Ancients!\"\n\nBrisk nods.\n\nSnow got to her feet, apprehensive.\n\n\"It's all right,\" I said. \"Remember. So far, they want me alive. I\ndon't have to worry unless they think up a scheme that doesn't need me.\"\n\n\"No, Jery, I'm coming with you!\" she said, clutching my arm. Those\nsmooth little fingers bit in like dull teeth. She must have been better\nat sports than her pupil, Ted.\n\n\"Snow, the way I see it, this is going to be dangerous.\"\n\nHer fists went to her hips. \"And by what omniscience are you certain\nthat I'll be safe back here?\" she queried.\n\nShe had me there. The sugarfeet were being buddies at the moment.\nHowever, a quick change of plan, and Snow might end up vaporized,\ngnawed, or just left to starve in this devious labyrinth.\n\n\"Okay, come along,\" I sighed. \"But hold my hand.\"\n\n\"I won't get lost,\" she protested.\n\n\"That wasn't the reason, honey,\" I grinned at her.\n\nHer eyes flashed a moment, and her nostrils made a perfunctory flare.\nThen she smiled, surprisingly shy, and slipped her hand into mine. \"For\nmoral support,\" she said.\n\n\"Nice rationalizing,\" I said, but she didn't pull away. Together, we\nfollowed Clatclit out of the chamber.\n\nAnd that's when I learned the primary function of that red spike at\nthe tip of the tail. No sooner were we away from the fungus-lighted\nchamber, than that tiny trylon began to glow, first pale pink, then a\nbrighter scarlet, and finally a brilliant yellow-orange. We followed\nthat bobbing tailtip like the _ignis fatuus_ through the bowels of\nHell. Snow's grip on my hand grew a little tighter as we progressed\nalong the slippery red rock of the nearly circular passage.\n\n\"A regular candy-coated firefly,\" I joked, to lighten her mood.\n\"What'll they think of next!\"\n\nShe didn't answer.\n\n\"Bad joke?\" I asked.\n\n\"No ... it's--Did you notice, Jery? We're going _down_.\"\n\nWe did seem to be descending, at that. I could imagine Snow's mind\nconjuring up tons of planet pressing down on us without warning.\n\n\"Not down,\" I said to her. \"Downer. If it sets your mind at rest, we\njust took off from a place way below ground. If the roof didn't fall in\nthere, it probably won't up ahead.\"\n\n\"How do you know that?\" she asked, her curiosity taking the place of\nher trepidation, which was what I'd hoped for.\n\n\"The air,\" I said. \"We were breathing in that chamber, remember? For\nthe air to be that plentiful, we just had to be far under the ground,\nalready. The atmosphere grows denser as one descends, you know; like on\nthe canal bottoms.\"\n\n\"I've never been on a canal bottom,\" she said.\n\n\"Come to think of it, neither have I! I must have read that someplace.\"\n\nWe followed Clatclit and his magic taillight a few more yards, then\nSnow said, \"You don't have to kid around to buck me up, Jery.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes I do,\" I disagreed sincerely. \"For some reason or other, my\nmain worry at the moment is for you. So if I can keep you happy, I'm\nhappy. See?\"\n\n\"Uh-huh,\" she said softly. Her hand pressed mine more tightly for a\nbrief moment. \"Thanks.\"\n\n\"If you think you can repay my efforts with a mere word of gratitude,\"\nI said in a villainous whisper, \"you have lots to learn about men, poor\nchild.\"\n\n\"Jery, don't joke any more. I'm frightened, really frightened,\" she\nsaid, her voice trembling.\n\n\"Okay,\" I said, and left off. I didn't tell her, but my own pulsebeat\nwouldn't have qualified me for a hero medal, either. Then, up ahead\nin the blackness beyond Clatclit's glowing tail spike, I heard a dull\nroaring.\n\nA few hundred yards further on, the roar was louder, and I could feel\nit through the soles of my boots.\n\n\"What is it, Jery?\" Snow whispered.\n\n\"It sounds like water!\" I said. \"Like more water than I thought there\nwas on this whole spaceborne Death Valley!\"\n\n\"Jery!\" Snow's fingers dug into my palm. \"If this is the way to the\nAncients, then this must be what Clatclit meant when he told you he\ncould only take you so far and no further!\"\n\n\"Sure it is!\" I exclaimed excitedly. \"A child could have figured it\nout. What else but water could impede these rock-hard things!\"\n\nClatclit was slowing his pace and moving more carefully. Then, not ten\nfeet in front of him, the fiery glow of his tail tip was reflected\nfrom a million foaming, shifting wet surfaces. He took another few\ncourageous steps, then halted, pressed back against the curve of the\ntunnel wall.\n\nHe'd averted his gaze from the raging torrent beyond him, but his\noutstretched hand still pointed in that direction. I felt a cold wet\nspray on my face, and saw, with a little shock, that some of the\nglittering facets of Clatclit's scaly hide were already becoming pocked\nand eroded.\n\n\"We'll have to go fast,\" I said, releasing Snow's hand only to clutch\nher arm tightly against my side. \"If we take too long, our luciferous\nfriend here will be a sticky red puddle. And I don't intend crossing\nthat in the dark!\"\n\n\"_That_\" was a jagged ridge of rock that continued forward from where\nour segment of tunnel ended, scant feet beyond Clatclit's cowering\nform. It was glistening with pools of black water and wet froth, flung\nup there by the raging river that passed less than a foot beneath its\nslightly arched surface. The torrent rushed angrily from somewhere in\nthe hollow blackness to our right, leaped and sprayed past the natural\nbridge of rock, barely two feet wide, that lay before our feet, and\nthen--\n\nMy stomach grew sick at the sight just to the left of the bridge.\n\nThe vaulted tunnel which contained this black Martian river dipped and\ndropped. The river, just beyond our frail bridge, was a black cataract\nfalling into the heart of the planet.\n\n\"Jery,\" Snow said, shivering. \"Hold me. Hold me tight, or I'll never\nget across that!\"\n\n\"It's all right,\" I said, with a calm tone that surprised the hell out\nof me. \"Here.\" I got directly behind her and ran my hands along the\nundersides of her forearms, gripping them tightly midway to her wrists.\n\"Now, just walk as I direct you, Snow. Close your eyes if you want. I\nwon't guide you wrong.\"\n\n\"I trust you, Jery,\" she said softly.\n\n\"Okay then, honey.\" I kept my voice gentle, soothing. \"Left foot\nforward. No, a bit more. There! Okay, now the right foot.\" She swayed\na little in my grasp, on the first slippery section of that dangerous\narch of rock. \"Easy! That's it, honey, you're doing fine. Now your\nleft. Ah! Okay. And then the right. Swell.\"\n\nStep by nightmare step, we crossed the arch, Snow moving her feet\nblindly forward in exploratory shuffles, and I, forgetting my own\ndanger in my concern for her, moving steadily with her, eyeing each\nspot on that rock ahead of her feet for safety. The light grew dimmer\nby the minute as we crept further and further from Clatclit.\n\nI wondered how long I could have stood in a spray of liquid caustic or\nacid, holding a light for some friends.\n\nThen the last step was made, and without my knowing how it happened,\nSnow was tightly in my arms, facing me now, her silky hair against my\ncheek, her arms locked about my waist.\n\n\"Easy, baby, easy.\" I mumbled into her ear. \"We've arrived, we're okay.\nJust relax.\"\n\nShe turned her face up to mine, and I forgot to speak. Suddenly my\nmouth was down on hers, hard, my arms crushing her against me. We clung\nlike that for a dizzy moment, then broke apart.\n\n\"Snow,\" I gripped her wrists and held her there, staring at me. \"Snow,\ndarling, if we ever get out of this alive--\"\n\n\"I know,\" she breathed. \"I know, Jery. I love you!\"\n\nI kissed her again, gently, this time. Then we started off down the\ntunnel, away from Clatclit's light. I hoped he wasn't melted beyond\nrepair. I knew, though, after that shattering exchange of affection\nwith Snow, that I sure was!\n\nBehind us the light vanished. I looked back, but could discern neither\nClatclit, nor the rock bridge, nor the torrent.\n\n\"I guess we feel our way from here on in,\" I remarked.\n\n\"No,\" said Snow, halting close beside me. \"There, up ahead, Jery! A\nlight.\"\n\nTogether we moved down the tunnel. The light grew in intensity. Then\nwe'd reached the lighted area. We were face to face with a peculiar\nred-bronze stone wall. No other tunnels led off from where we stood.\nThere was no direction we could go from there except back toward that\nperilous underground cataract.\n\n\"Could we have come the wrong way?\" Snow asked. \"Maybe we missed a\nturnoff back there in the tunnel where it was darker.\"\n\n\"No,\" I said. \"I had my hands feeling the walls all the way from the\nbridge onward, until we could see our way. This must be the right\nplace.\"\n\nThen on a sudden instinctive hunch I turned to Snow. \"Got a lipstick in\nthat handbag of yours?\"\n\nShe looked at me blankly, but nodded, and produced the slim metal tube\nfor my inspection.\n\nI took it from her fingers, slipped off the cap, and twirled up a\nhalf-inch of the glossy red wax. \"Now let's see if I'm right about this\nwall,\" I said, and made a streaking motion across the rough surface\nwith the lipstick.\n\nThe end of the wax cylinder came away a bit disturbed by its apparent\ncontact with the surface before us, but the wall held no trace, no\nmark, not even a smudge. I saw the little curls of sheared-off wax\nfalling down the face of the wall to the floor of the tunnel.\n\nI handed the lipstick back to a bewildered Snow.\n\n\"Just as I thought,\" I said. \"That, honey, is the rock known as\nparabolite. The toughest, most impervious substance in the solar\nsystem. Nothing marks it, scratches it, or even budges it. We couldn't\nget past here with an intercontinental size collapser!\"\n\n\"But Jery, look!\" Snow cried, pointing at the wall. I looked. The flat\nwall of parabolite, the impervious mineral, was going slowly concave in\nthe center. I took hold of Snow by the shoulders, and pulled her back\nfrom that rapidly deepening hemisphere, expecting--I don't know _what_\nI was expecting. But I was scared speechless.\n\nThe thing bulged back away from us until its diameter was equal to that\nof the tunnel itself, and then, before my hypnotized gaze, the deepest\nsection of the ruddy mineral gaped, like a hole suddenly pricked in the\nside of a bubble. The remainder of the parabolite wrenched violently\naway from the opening, leaving us a clear gateway into--\n\nInto a vast chamber of eye-disturbing metal, that shifted and shimmered\nin some mind-chilling fashion that made me want to turn and run with\nSnow back down that black tunnel behind us.\n\n\"Come in, Jery Delvin,\" said the voice of an _ancient Martian_.\n\n\n\n\n15\n\n\nSnow and I stepped into the great gleaming chamber. I was very much\ndisconcerted when the wall behind us contracted suddenly back into\nplace. Wherever we were, we were there until the Ancients decided to\nlet us out.\n\n\"Who is the person with you?\" said a voice. It had a frowning note to\nit, but I could not discern the source of the words anywhere in that\nsilver-white blur of metal universe that spread away from us in all\ndirections.\n\n\"She--\" I said as boldly as possible, feeling like an escapee from\nFenimore Cooper \"--she is my woman!\"\n\nSilence. Then, \"She will be allowed.\"\n\n\"Allowed to what?\" I demanded.\n\n\"Allowed to be,\" said the voice, without emotion.\n\nSnow's fingers nearly went through my hand.\n\n\"Well, thanks,\" I said, figuring politeness wouldn't hurt. I held tight\nto Snow, supplementing our hand grip with an arm-in-arm lock. We took\nanother step forward. \"Where are you?\" I asked.\n\n\"You must come forward,\" said the voice.\n\nI took another step, then another, then came to a startled halt.\n\nAs if materializing out of the air, the Martian was before me. I stared\nat him, stupified.\n\n\"What's the matter, Jery? What is it?\" Snow said. Then she looked where\nI was looking, giving a little scream.\n\n\"It's all right, honey,\" I said, with hollow courage. \"He's a little\nimpressionistic, but--\"\n\n\"He?\" she cried, clinging to me. \"That--that thing?\"\n\nI looked at her, mystified, then back at the sort-of man I was standing\nbefore. He made my head spin a bit, what with apparently seeing him\nfrom front view and both profiles simultaneously, but he was mannish\nlooking.\n\n\"This guy, the Martian, honey,\" I said. \"Maybe you didn't take enough\nsteps forward.\"\n\n\"She cannot see me as you see me, Jery Delvin,\" said the Martian. \"Her\neyes only convey to her a fantastic whirl of hideous light and dark\nshapes. She, along with most others of your race, cannot apprehend my\nform as you can. This is why you were chosen, Jery Delvin.\"\n\n\"That's crazy,\" I protested. \"You're there, aren't you? You reflect\nlight into the eyes, right? Why can't she see you?\"\n\n\"The human eye is not the animal eye,\" said the Martian. \"An animal eye\nsees only meaningless shapes; animals use all their senses to identify\nobjects. But the human eye sees concepts, Jery Delvin. Where an animal\nmerely discerns eyes, feeding apparatus and breathing vents, the human\neye sees a face. Actually, there is no such thing as a face.\"\n\nIt was true enough, in a way, that the human eye tended to group\notherwise unrelated objects into concepts of non-actual reality.\n\n\"So how come I can see you, and she can't?\" I reiterated.\n\n\"You are gifted to see true,\" said the Martian. \"Your mind apprehends\nconcepts where it has previously expected to find none. You relate\nwhat you see, and correctly. As in the case of your deriving so much\ninformation from your conversation with Clatclit. Another man would not\nhave succeeded in that.\"\n\nI shook my head, confused. \"But I--I see you!\"\n\n\"No, Jery Delvin. Your mind sees me. Your eyes alone could not possibly\nview me since I am never entirely here to be viewed. Your eyes see\none part of me, then another, then another and another. But your mind\nrejects the idea that I am four separate entities, and sees me as I am,\na unit.\"\n\n\"You're here, you say, but you're not here, too?\" I choked, feeling\npositively giddy.\n\n\"I am not a three-dimensional creature,\" said the Martian. \"We whom you\ncall the Ancients are existing in four dimensions.\"\n\n\"I thought Einsteinian physics says that _time_ is the fourth\ndimension,\" I said slowly.\n\n\"It is not _time_,\" said the Martian. \"It is _place_ that is the fourth\ndimension. What is _here_, Jery Delvin? Or _there_? Remember, there is\nno _here_ or _there_ except in relationship to something else. If only\none small globe of rock comprised existing matter, Jery Delvin, where\nwould it be?\"\n\n\"It--That's silly. _One_ thing can't be anywhere!\" I said. \"It'd just\nbe floating in a void.\" Trying to picture such a void made my brain\nwhirl. I gave it up.\n\n\"I'm glad you understand,\" said the Martian. \"Very well, then. We, your\nAncients, are existing in a perfect _here-ness_, of which you can have\nno concept at all. We are living in not _a_ location, but in _location_\nitself.\"\n\n\"It's no use,\" I said. \"I can't even picture it.\"\n\n\"You're not supposed to,\" said the Martian, with a mechanical smile of\ncontempt. \"Even your mind, Jery Delvin, cannot fathom the magnitude of\nour being.\"\n\n\"Hold on a minute!\" I said, changing the subject. \"Clatclit told me\nthat you expected to compel my cooperation by keeping the Space Scouts\nyour prisoners unless I obeyed you.\"\n\n\"That is correct, Jery Delvin. And so, our desire is that you--\"\n\n\"Damn it!\" I exploded. \"Stop taking so much for granted! Before I even\nscratch where it itches to please you guys, I want to see those kids!\nAnd in damned good shape, too!\"\n\nSnow held onto my arm and trembled. This was it. Now we'd know for sure\nif the boys were all right.\n\nThe Martian looked exasperated, but then he reached an arm out from\nhimself--I couldn't tell exactly, without getting a blinding headache,\njust which way his arm went, left, right, up or down. But he reached\naway from himself in some direction or other, and the next moment,\nthe shimmering blur of metallic flooring between him and us gave way\nto a red-bronze platform of parabolite which rose like a sluggish\nelevator on close-intervalled narrow rods of the same mineral. Then, as\nthe apparatus halted, I realized that these rods were more than just\nsupports for that slab of rock. They were bars.\n\nAnd huddled together in this escape-free cage, I saw the fifteen\nmissing Space Scouts.\n\n\"Snow!\"\n\nOne of the boys, his hair as raven as Snow's was blonde, tore away from\nthe group and rushed over to the bars, jamming his arms between them to\nreach out for her.\n\n\"Ted!\" Snow cried, and rushed over to him. It was kind of awkward,\nembracing with the bars in the way, but they did it anyhow.\n\n\"Ted, dear Ted! Are you all right?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" he said, with a note of uncertainty. \"Yeah, I guess we are.\nOnly, I was almost giving up on you.\"\n\n\"Have you,\" the Martian's icy voice cut into the reunion, \"seen quite\nenough?\"\n\n\"Hold your horses!\" I hollered at him through the cage. \"She hasn't\nchecked him for broken bones, yet!\"\n\nThe Martian, whether out of patience or alien incomprehension of my\nsarcasm, left the cage where it was, and stood waiting.\n\n\"I knew you'd get my message, Snow!\" said Ted eagerly, quite forgetting\nhis doubts of a few seconds before. \"I just knew it. When do we get out\nof here, hey? We want to go home!\"\n\nApparently adventure lost its tang when the cage had first been lowered\ninto the--the whatever it was that served us as a floor. The other boys\nhad come up to the bars, now, all of them looking at Snow with longing,\nas the next best thing to a human-type mother.\n\n\"Oh, you poor kids,\" Snow sobbed suddenly. \"Have they been feeding you?\nWhen did you last wash your face, Ted?\"\n\n\"They don't feed us at all!\" Ted said sorrowfully. \"It's been weeks now\nsince we ran out of candy, and--\"\n\n\"Jery Delvin!\" the Martian's voice interrupted imperiously. \"Before\nthat look on your woman's face erupts into some more of her tiresome\nvituperation, will you explain to her what a metabolic stasis is?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" I said, folding my arms. \"As soon as you explain it to me!\"\n\nThe Martian seemed to be gathering himself for a cry of utter\nexasperation. Then he caught hold of himself and said with rigid calm,\n\"We merely have held the children within a field of radiation that\nobviates the necessity of their taking alimental nourishment.\"\n\nSnow looked over her shoulder at me, wonderingly.\n\n\"He means, honey, that they fixed it somehow so the kids didn't need to\neat. I guess it was simpler than running a catering service.\"\n\n\"Didn't need to eat!\" she exploded. \"Doesn't that blob of black\nsparklers know that growing boys need food to grow!\"\n\n\"There's no need to be redundant!\" said the Martian.\n\n\"To what?\" she cried, standing back from the cage to glare at him the\nbetter, with arms akimbo. The Martian took this golden opportunity to\nlet the cage drop suddenly back out of our ken. The shimmering blur of\nmetallic luster was once more at our feet.\n\n\"Oh!\" she cried, stepping forward and staring down. \"Ted! Teddy!\"\n\n\"Jery, Jery, Jery,\" Snow murmured tearfully, turning about and\nburrowing her nose into my chest, while I held her helplessly. \"He\nlooked s-so hungry!\"\n\nI decided to let her sob. Neither I nor the Martian, no matter what our\nbrain power, could drive this fixed notion out of her pretty little\nhead.\n\n\"Now that you have seen them,\" said the Martian, \"perhaps we can get to\nthe business at hand?\"\n\nI seemed to be out of dilatory alibis.\n\n\"Okay,\" I said. \"What do you want from me?\"\n\n\"We want you to destroy Philip Baxter,\" said the Martian.\n\n\n\n\n16\n\n\n\"Destroy Baxter?\" I echoed stupidly. \"I was dragged all the way from\nEarth to do that?\"\n\n\"Since we are here, and you were there,\" said the Martian,\ncondescendingly, \"what other choice did we have?\"\n\n\"You could have sent a letter,\" I muttered.\n\n\"Hardly,\" the Martian said, unperturbed. \"Since physical contact\nbetween our two dimensions is impossible.\"\n\n\"It is?\" I said, surprised.\n\n\"Of course!\" the Martian snapped. \"If it were not, we'd have destroyed\nBaxter ourselves.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you use the sugarfeet?\" I asked, bewildered. \"Clatclit\nseems to have shown no ineptness in disintegrating other Earthmen.\"\n\n\"For the simple reason,\" said the Martian, with cold anger, \"that on\nyour wretchedly humid planet, a sugarfoot would be corroded to death\nbefore it could locate him. If, of course, it had already overcome the\nother obvious difficulties such as getting there, since Earth does not\npermit immigration of alien species.\"\n\nLike a hot spark flaring where only ice had been before, a tiny\nlight of hope began to burn in my heart. The Martians, for all their\nfour-dimensional superiority, didn't know that Baxter was on Mars!\nHell, why should they? I knew Baxter personally, and I didn't know he\nwas on Mars until he was good and ready to let me know it.\n\n\"Jery--\" said Snow, about to spill the beans.\n\n\"Ixnay, lover!\" I growled. \"Unless you want these guys tossing in the\nhand, and switching to Plan C! Remember?\"\n\nI hoped she'd recall what had happened to those would-be rebels once\nthe Ancients no longer had a use for them. I could tell, a second\nlater, by her involuntary gasp, that she did.\n\n\"What was the import of that exchange?\" the Martian asked, fairly\nsmoldering with suspicion. \"Your idioms were elusive.\"\n\n\"My woman was about to beg me not to do your will,\" I lied carefully.\n\"I merely pointed out to her that if I refused, you would simply\nobliterate us and utilize some other scheme.\"\n\n\"Intelligent thinking, Jery Delvin,\" said the Martian. For a horrible\nmoment, I thought he meant he'd caught onto my misinterpretation of my\nwords. Then I knew all was well, relatively, as he went on. \"As to the\nmethod of destruction, we leave it to you to choose. However, haste is\nof paramount importance to us.\"\n\n\"Excuse me,\" I interrupted, \"but would you answer me one probably\nidiotic question?\"\n\n\"If it is within my range of information,\" said the Martian.\n\n\"Well, just why are you so set on getting rid of Baxter? Mind you, I\nhave no overwhelming affection for him myself. But I can't figure your\nangle.\"\n\n\"The motivation is the usual, basic one. Even you humans follow it:\nSurvival.\"\n\n\"Survival?\" I repeated, blinking.\n\n\"Philip Baxter possesses the knowledge of the method of our\ndestruction,\" said the Martian. \"That in itself is a bad thing, but\nhe has two more things besides this knowledge that make his removal\nimperative. He also possesses the means and the intention of using this\nmeans.\"\n\n\"What?\" said Snow, losing the pedantic thread.\n\n\"He means, honey, that Baxter's not only got the knowhow to bump off\nthis bunch, but the wherewithal and the urge.\"\n\n\"You Earthmen have a rather colorful succinctness of speech,\" the\nMartian observed.\n\nSnow looked at me for help. \"We what?\"\n\nI grinned at her despite our situation. \"We talk purty,\" I interpreted.\nThen turning back to the Martian: \"But if there cannot be physical\ncontact between the races, why worry about Baxter? It seems to me that\nthe worst he could do is snub you!\"\n\n\"I'd better give you a bit more detail.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute.\" I held up a hand in protest. \"If you tell me what\nBaxter knows then won't I be--\"\n\n\"A threat to us? No. I do not intend to tell you the specific manner in\nwhich we can be destroyed, simply the nature of the destruction.\"\n\n\"All right. What?\"\n\n\"You're aware, of course, of the geocentric theory of the universe?\"\n\n\"Mmmm, I've heard of it. Isn't that the theory, once held by people\non earth, that the Earth was the center of all creation, and the sun\nrevolved around it, not vice-versa?\"\n\n\"That is the one. Now, though your race believed it to be a false\ntheory--\"\n\n\"It is false!\" I protested.\n\n\"For Earth, yes. But not, you see, for Mars. This place where you now\nstand, this brief liaison-point between our dimension and yours, is the\ncenter of your physical universe.\"\n\n\"You're crazy,\" I said. \"Why, the sun alone is too massive to swing\nabout this planet, let alone everything else! It'd be like a small boy\ntrying to twirl a ten-ton boulder on the end of a rope; even if he\nmanaged, somehow, to get it started in motion, within ten seconds it'd\nbe swinging him!\"\n\n\"And if this small boy had another ten-ton boulder on the other side of\nhim?\"\n\n\"Well--uh ...\"\n\n\"And another one above, and below, and in all directions from him? What\nthen?\"\n\nI thought it over. \"He'd be a mighty tired boy.\"\n\n\"That is not funny.\"\n\n\"It needs work,\" I admitted.\n\n\"Jery Delvin,\" said the Martian with open irritation, \"time is\nfleeting, and I cannot afford to dally while you play semantic\npingpong with my words! Kindly allow me to complete my statement of\nthis situation, or I shall decide by your flippancy that you no longer\ndesire the companionship of your woman!\"\n\nThat one, I detected by the sudden stiffening of Snow's hand in mine, I\ndidn't need to translate. I shut up.\n\n\"This, then,\" the Martian went on more calmly, \"is despite what your\nscientists say, the center of your universe. If they will but compute\nthe masses, orbits and velocities of all other matter in the universe,\nthey will see that. Or are they yet aware of the universe in its\nentirety?\"\n\n\"Not--not quite,\" I said carefully, not wanting to chance losing Snow.\n\"Our astronomical instruments have a limited sensitivity to light. We\nsee pretty damned far, but there's always something more beyond.\"\n\n\"Very well, then, you'll have to take my word for it. However, if you\nhave properly understood the fact that our dimension exists at the\nplace of Location itself, you will see at once that our only possible\npoint of contact with your universe is at the central, non-moving\npoint.\"\n\n\"I think I see,\" I said. \"If you tried making contact anywhere else,\nit'd go speeding off from you, so to speak.\"\n\n\"Good. You understand perfectly. What Baxter proposes to do is to break\nour liaison, thus confining us to our own dimension forever.\n\n\"He proposes to do this by detonating a segment of our physical\nuniverse, one which coexists with yours. This will produce only the\nslightest of jolts in our world, but the balance between the two\nuniverses is so delicate that even this minor tremor will move us--by\nmoving our contact-material--out of alignment. And we, since we exist\nin Location, cannot then move ourselves back.\"\n\n\"Would ... uh, would that be so terrible?\" I asked nervously. \"What do\nyou gain by the contact anyhow?\"\n\n\"The contact,\" said the Martian. \"It is something we have always had.\nWe don't need it, but we like less the idea of having it arbitrarily\ntaken from us.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" I said. \"I don't suppose you happen to know Baxter's angle in all\nthis? I mean the reason for his urge to destroy you.\"\n\n\"Power,\" the Martian said simply. \"You have heard of the Amnesty, of\ncourse?\"\n\n\"Have I!\" I muttered.\n\n\"Well, then. You know that the wearer cannot be countermanded by any\nbut the combined veto of the World President and Philip Baxter himself.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, puzzled.\n\n\"Then who, if Philip Baxter were to wear the Amnesty, could countermand\nhim?\"\n\nI realized with a shock that no one on the three planets of Earth's\ndomain could, the way the rules were set up.\n\n\"But people wouldn't stand for a dictator,\" I argued. \"They'd vote out\nthe power of the Amnesty.\"\n\n\"And if there was no more vote? Jery Delvin, Interplanetary Security\nis currently the most powerful organization in your world. Its agents\npossess the most invincible of weapons, the collapser ray-gun. Philip\nBaxter wields the power, even now. But he desires that it should become\nknown.\"\n\n\"Known?\" said Snow uncertainly.\n\n\"He means, Snow, that it's no fun being the boss if nobody knows it.\nThe more I think of it, the more I think Baxter can actually get away\nwith it.\" I returned my attention to the Martian. \"If he's held off\ntaking over until you people were unhitched from our universe, then you\nmust be a threat to him!\"\n\n\"Only in his mind, Jery Delvin. He learned that we exist. He also\nlearned that we had non-Earthly abilities. He decided that we therefore\nwere superior in knowledge of weapons of destruction. One cannot be a\nsuccessful dictator when another being has more power, or if one thinks\nsuch is the case.\"\n\n\"Then you haven't such weapons?\"\n\n\"We have. But, as I told you, physical contact between our races is\nimpossible.\" It gave a shrug. \"Any attempt on our part to use our\nweapons would result in that very jolt we are trying so desperately to\navoid.\"\n\n\"I get it. You can shoot the charging rhino, but the recoil knocks you\noff the cliff.\"\n\n\"Overly metaphoric but substantially correct. So you must destroy\nBaxter for us.\"\n\n\"I'd like nothing better. I can get back to Earth, and alert the\npresident, and maybe get the wheels rolling for an investigation of IS.\"\n\n\"Impossible!\" the Martian snapped. \"We dare not wait any longer. As\nyet, Baxter has confided his _modus operandi_ to no one. Once he tells\nanother man, then that man tells a third, and soon we become hopelessly\nvulnerable. No, the man himself must be destroyed, not just his power.\nWhen he dies, the power will die with him if you then tell your story.\"\n\n\"But I can't just walk up to him and kill him,\" I said.\n\n\"Since we are completely aware that you can, I must take it that you\nmean you will not.\"\n\n\"No, not that, exactly. But look, he's been a stinker, I know, but it's\nnot in my power to destroy a fellow human being in cold blood.\"\n\n\"Then we shall heat your blood, Jery Delvin,\" the Martian replied. \"We\nwill warm it with the racking anger you shall feel against us, knowing\nthat these human children shall perish if you fail!\" A cunning light\ncame into the Martian's eyes. \"And not only these children,\" it said.\n\"But your woman as well!\"\n\n\"No!\" I cried, grabbing hold of Snow in both my arms. \"I'll do it, but\njust leave her alone!\"\n\n\"She stays here with us until you return successful.\"\n\n\"She does not!\" I yelled, shaking. \"I can't leave the woman I love with\na creep that looks to her like a blob of black sparklers! I--\"\n\nWith cold horror, I realized that my arms were embracing nothingness.\nSnow was standing, wide-eyed, ten feet away.\n\n\"Jery!\" she cried, trying to come toward me. Instead, her steps slid\nover that shimmering metallic blur, and she remained in place.\n\n\"We who live in the heart of Location,\" said the Martian affably, \"have\na certain mastery over locale.\"\n\n\"You can't do this,\" I said unreasonably. Because it was quite obvious\nit was being done. Inexorably.\n\n\"Snow--\" I said, and couldn't go on. The vision of Snow was moving\nback from me, or I was moving backward, or both. But the gap between\nus widened by the second. Then I was back in the rocky red tunnel, the\nparabolite sphincter narrowing swiftly before my face.\n\n\"Be--be careful, Snow!\" I called, like an imbecile.\n\nThe wall was solid again.\n\n\n\n\n17\n\n\nSimultaneous with that parabolite wall shutting in my face, three\ndisturbing thoughts occurred to me: One, Baxter didn't have the\nAmnesty; Snow did! Probably in that catch-all handbag of hers. Two, if\nthe Ancients could float me and Snow and the Space Scouts about like so\nmuch helium, why the hell didn't they just de-localize Baxter into a\nsnake pit or something? And three, if physical contact was impossible\nbetween the races, how in heaven's name did they gimmick the Brain back\non Earth? Which was also, come to think of it, moving awfully fast\nin relation to their liaison-point with the geocentric point of the\nuniverse!\n\nA very baffled man, I began feeling my way down the tunnel toward that\nmighty roar of underground waters. The light paled and grew gray as I\nmoved away from the parabolite wall. Then I was in darkness, feeling\nthe bare stone with my fingers as I stepped carefully toward the\nincreasing volume of ragged sound.\n\nThen the wall curved away from my outstretched fingertips, and I knew I\nstood at the brink of that precarious arch of rock. There was nothing\nbut blackness there, now.\n\n\"Clatclit!\" I hollered over the boom of the river waters. \"Clatclit,\nit's me, Jery!\"\n\nThe rush of the boiling rapids was too great, however. It thundered\nby and swept the faint vibration of my voice along with it into that\nenormous well to my right.\n\nThen I remembered Clatclit's manner of instruction to that hay-bale\nbeast, what seemed like ages ago, out on the craggy Martian hillside. I\nput hooked thumb and forefinger into my mouth, and let off a piercing\nwhistle.\n\nAhead of me in the darkness there was a glimmering of visibility, and\nthen a feeble pink taillight waggled slowly up and down, far back\nbeyond the other end of the bridge. Clatclit wasn't chancing moving as\nclose to the death-dealing spray as before.\n\nHowever, though a more powerful beam had been necessary to see by when\nI'd been moving into darkness, the pale glow was sufficient for the\nreturn trip. All I needed was a beacon, something to sight upon, so I\nwouldn't go astray in my slow crawl across that slippery curve of rock.\nYes, crawl. This trip, I negotiated the arch on hands and knees.\n\nAnd then I was across and hurrying down the corridor to the bend around\nwhich Clatclit shivered and waited. He stood up from his slouch against\nthe wall, from which weary stance he'd been waving me onward with his\ntaillight.\n\n\"Wow!\" I said, catching dim sight of him in the weak glow of his\nwater-pitted trylon. The sharp ruby glint was missing from his\nerstwhile pyramidic facets; now they looked dull crimson, and ropy,\nlike taffy that has congealed after boiling over and dribbling down\nthe side of the saucepan. \"Does it hurt?\" I asked, feeling partially\nresponsible.\n\nSide-to-side motion.\n\n\"It bothers you in some way, though, is that it?\"\n\nNod.\n\n\"How?\" I asked, unable to think of a yes-no question.\n\nClatclit pointed to my wrist, shook his head, pointed to my wrist\nagain, and gestured upward, then nodded.\n\n\"Time. No ... other time. Uh ... Earth?\"\n\nHeadshake. He rose on tiptoe and pointed up again.\n\n\"Beyond Earth. The sun!\"\n\nNod.\n\n\"You mean that at this time, it doesn't bother you. But it will later,\nwhen you need the scales for absorbing sunlight?\"\n\nA very weary nod.\n\n\"Damn, that's rough. Will they grow back again?\"\n\nPause. Nod. Tiptoe point. Three taps on wrist. Shrug.\n\n\"Yes. When the sun makes three times--In three days' time?\"\n\nNod. Wrist-tap. Hands clasped to belly. Disgusted shrug.\n\n\"But in the meantime, you go hungry, sort of?\"\n\nNod. Then, the social amenities taken care of, Clatclit pointed to me,\nto the ground, and looked questioningly.\n\n\"The Ancients have decided I'm to bump off Baxter,\" I said. \"Then\nthey'll release Snow and the boys. Not before.\"\n\nClatclit stared at me a moment, placed a hand on my shoulder, and\nshook his head, like a sympathetic friend. Then he took his claws and\nmade a tugging, struggling motion with them, as though trying to tear\nsomething which wouldn't give. He followed it up with an incongruously\ncomic coin-flipping motion to the back of his hand. It was his devious\nway of expressing the slang phrase, \"Tough luck.\"\n\n\"You said it,\" I muttered. \"Come on, though. The less time I leave Snow\nwith the blob of black sparklers, the better. I've got to get to the\nspaceport.\"\n\nClatclit nodded and began his lumbering waddle off into the labyrinth.\nThe Ancients probably expected me to book passage on the next Earth\nflight, to assassinate Baxter. They didn't know he was sitting right in\ntheir laps, in the Security sector of the field. It was just as well.\nI didn't relish the possibility of my elimination if they knew he was\nright where a sugarfoot could blast him as well as anybody.\n\nAs I trailed Clatclit up the wearisome slope that was taking us to the\nsurface, I did some heavy thinking. The Ancients, before Earthmen first\nlanded on Mars, probably had wandered about the planet freely, on the\nsurface, living in their dwellings of parabolite, using their artifacts\nof the same impervious mineral. Then Earth, that paradoxically\npeace-loving and war-making planet, lands colonists. The Ancients, just\nfrom plain discretion, hide themselves and observe these unwelcome\nnewcomers. Once it becomes clear to them that there is a potential\nmenace from Baxter--who is no young chicken, having been in power\nbefore the first landing--they stay hidden, and start scheming to get\nrid of this guy who can jolt them out of their liaison.\n\nI pondered over that bit. The Ancient had said that Baxter intended\ndoing it by detonating a portion of their contact-material. Hell, they\nmust mean parabolite! What other substance in the solar system was so\nalien to--\n\nAnd with that thought, I suddenly knew the secret of that apparently\nimpervious mineral's strength. No wonder it could not be destroyed! It\nwas only in existence in our skimpy three dimensions in a fractional\nway. One-fourth of it was always present in the Ancients' world, since\nit couldn't _fit_ into our universe in its entirety. And that meant not\nonly one-fourth of its apparent mass, but one-fourth of even its atomic\nstructure!\n\nEven the collapsers, working on subatomic particles, were at a\ndisadvantage. You can't nudge an electron out of orbit if it isn't\nactually fixed in that orbit. Three-quarters of those four-dimensional\nelectrons were always cushioned by that elusive final segment that lay\noutside our universe. So trying to destroy parabolite by force was in\nthe same class as trying to shatter a rubber ball with a hammer; a\nrubber ball which was hanging from an elastic cord, in fact! It just\ngave into the other dimension and rebounded frisky as ever.\n\n\"Boy,\" I thought, \"this is going to put the skids under that scientific\ntheory about parabolite's imperviousness. Parabolic molecules, ha!\nWell, it was a good theory while it lasted; it fit the known facts, at\nleast. Hell, the stuff even has the wrong name! It ought to be called\nElasto-plast, or some such euphonic label.\"\n\nClatclit paused in his climb up the tunnel slope, and turned a querying\nstare on me.\n\n\"Was I talking aloud?\" I asked.\n\nCurious nod.\n\n\"Sorry, it's nothing,\" I said, indicating that he should proceed with\nour journey. \"Just the salesman in me coming to life. You can't have\npublic interest without catchy trade-names. Once an ad man, always an\nad man.\"\n\nClatclit looked positively bewildered.\n\n\"Sorry. Business talk,\" I explained.\n\nHe shrugged and continued his upward climb, with me tagging after the\nbobbing pink taillight.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs secure as the maximum-security Security prison was supposed to be,\nwe got in with no trouble. The planet must be a regular yarn-ball\nof those rocky tubes. If you know the layout, you can apparently get\nanywhere from anywhere.\n\nOur only excursion from the steady upward climb had been a brief\nstop-off in one of those fungus-lighted rooms. Clatclit picked up my\ncollapser and returned it to me.\n\nI felt infinitely more confidant of success with its thick golden\nhandle jutting out of my holster once more. Perhaps I could just find\nBaxter, sneak a bolt into his face, and scurry off into the labyrinth\non Clatclit's heels.\n\nI knew, even as I thought it, that I wouldn't be able to just blast\nhim like that. I'd probably have to face up to him, pull an \"All\nright, pardner--draw!\" sort of sentence on him, and then pray that\nI was faster. It was unthinkable for me to act in any other manner.\nThe give-a-guy-a-chance instinct was part of our national heritage,\nsomething called the code of the West, handed down to us by pioneer\nforefathers.\n\nThe method of ingress to the building was simplicity itself. The tunnel\nwe'd been negotiating came to an abrupt end at a wall of granite slabs\nsuch as had buttressed my prison cell. I reached for the collapser, but\nClatclit laid a restraining claw on my hand.\n\nI watched, curious, as he put his left ear-orifice to the wall and\nlistened intently. Then, seeming satisfied, he put his hands on the\nbiggest slab of granite and pushed.\n\nNothing happened for a moment. Then the slab began to pivot about some\ncentral axis, and a one-foot gap was exposed on either side of its\nbulk. Beyond the open spaces, bright fluorescent tubing lighted a grim\nprison corridor.\n\n\"Isn't there an easier way to the spaceport?\" I said.\n\nA prison meant guards, and guards meant collapsers, and collapsers\nmeant, possibly, good-by Jery Delvin.\n\nBut Clatclit shrugged, pointed into the tunnel, and made zig-zag\nmotions with both hands, all the while shaking his head in weary\ndisgust.\n\n\"There is, but it'd take forever to get there, huh?\" I interpreted. He\nnodded. Oh well.\n\nClatclit leading the way, we sidled through the right-hand gap, then he\npressed the mammoth stone back into place.\n\n\"You're coming with me all the way?\" I asked, surprised. Somehow, I'd\nthought his guideship ended at the same place the tunnel did.\n\nClatclit nodded vigorously.\n\n\"Is it that the Ancients don't trust me?\"\n\nHeadshake.\n\n\"You have nothing better to do?\"\n\nNegative.\n\n\"Okay, I'll bite. Why?\"\n\nClatclit stepped toward me, placed a hand on my shoulder, then placed\nhis free hand over my heart, moved it over his own, held up two fingers\nand crossed them.\n\n\"Because we're friends,\" I said softly.\n\nClatclit nodded.\n\nIt took us an hour to locate Baxter. Clatclit showed no signs of\nsurprise when I did not go to the ticket office and book a passage for\nEarth. Apparently, not being in on the finer points of the Ancients'\nscheme, he found no wild incongruity in my being brought all the\nway from Earth to obliterate a man who could just as easily have\nbeen dispatched by a sugarfoot. Or else, through some extrasensory\nawareness, something born of our friendship, he knew that imparting the\nlocation of Baxter to the Ancients might well mean my death.\n\nWhatever his reasons, Clatclit simply followed me in my progress\nthrough the prison dungeon which, thanks to its completely escape-proof\nstone-corked cells, was left without guards. We went up into the more\nwell-appointed section of the building, the warmly plastic-decorated\nhalls that were open to the public who passed through the Security\ninspection when entering or leaving the planet. It was good business to\nhide the grimmer realities from colonists or casual tourists.\n\nAnd those who learned about the dungeons were never in a position to\npass the word around. Your first view of a Security dungeon was usually\nyour last view of anything.\n\nThe public part of the building had too many people in it to suit\nme. Even if I could get by the flight officials and robo-scanners\nunchallenged, Clatclit couldn't. The building was rigidly off-limits to\nextraterrestrials.\n\nSo we went up the outside.\n\nBuilt against, and a good ways into, the high hills that surrounded\nthe town, the building was easy prey for anyone who cared to clamber\nup the rocky slopes from which it jutted and climb through a window.\nThese slopes were lighted, but not patrolled. After all, under ordinary\ncircumstances, no one in his right mind would try sneaking into an IS\nstronghold!\n\nBaxter, as it turned out, was seated at a desk not unlike his own back\non Earth, in the very office where I'd been last interrogated by the\nteam of Charlie and Foster. He was staring into space, and smoking a\ncigar, the solitary incandescent lamp on his desk making his ice-white\nmane of hair a sort of angelic aurora about that pleasantly rubicund\nface. It was like seeing Satan sporting a good-conduct medal.\n\nClatclit and I were crouched outside the window, on a narrow ledge we'd\nreached from the slope. To my intense interest, lying before Baxter, in\nthe glaring circle of lamplight, was the black shirt I'd been wearing\nwhen I was rescued by Clatclit, the shirt which had been towed off by\nthat hay-bale to obviate Baxter's being able to track the route of my\nflight.\n\nI was about to whisper a question about the shirt to Clatclit, when\nBaxter turned partway about in his chair, and started to stub out the\ncigar in a black onyx ashtray. The question stuck in my throat, as I\ncaught sight of Baxter's breast.\n\nOn a silver chain about his throat, he wore the Amnesty!\n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\nSomething was very definitely wrong.\n\nUntil that moment when Baxter turned, I'd been certain that the Amnesty\nwas in Snow's possession. And now here it was, gleaming in bright red\nand bronze against the front of his crisp black linen blouse.\n\nThe sight of it twanged a chord in my mind, and I crouched there on\nthat narrow ledge, trying to grasp the fleeting thread of thought. The\nAmnesty was exactly the same color as that parabolite wall down in the\ntunnels, the barrier to the lair of the Ancients. Was it a coincidence\nthat this token of power was designed to match in shade and intensity\nof color that unearthly mineral of another dimension?\n\nA queer notion began to take root in my mind. Baxter had given me the\nAmnesty before I set off to find the missing boys. Or had he? Was that\nthe Amnesty I'd carried, or a copy, a perfect duplicate constructed not\nof metal, but the impervious mineral.\n\nMy brain was spinning as little unimportant facts suddenly burgeoned\nand grew, and took on terrible significance. According to our science,\nparabolite was invulnerable to all tools, and could not be worked or\nshaped. Yet the Martian had said to me that Baxter possessed the means\nto disengage the fragile bond that linked the two dimensions by--The\ntruth came home to me with an icy shock.\n\nBy detonating a portion of their contact-material! And the Amnesty, my\nAmnesty, was that material. I looked past Baxter to the black blouse,\nits lining sparkling beneath the incandescent lamplight with thousands\nof tiny metal filaments, and then I knew at last Baxter's monstrous\nplan.\n\nCold fury welled up inside me. I could easily, at that moment, have\nleveled my collapser at him and flashed him out of existence with no\nmore feeling than that engendered by crushing a gnat between finger and\nthumb. My hand was sliding back toward that cold metal handle jutting\nfrom my holster, when there came an interruption.\n\nThe door before Baxter's desk opened, and Charlie and Foster came in.\nClatclit and I ducked back from the pane, and listened, holding our\nbreaths.\n\n\"About time!\" Baxter growled. \"Since you two are alone, I assume this\nwas another wild goose chase!\"\n\nHis fist slammed down atop the crumpled shirt, and I caught his\nmeaning. Apparently, when they'd discovered my cell empty, they'd\ntracked my trail by whatever electronic device followed up the location\nof that rigged garment, and had been led miles astray in the Martian\ndesert, finding only the empty blouse at the end of their quest.\n\n\"Yes and no, sir,\" Charlie said. \"It's--it's the weirdest thing.\"\n\n\"Well? What?\" Baxter snapped angrily.\n\nCharlie, while replying, was unhitching a sort of tanklike apparatus\nfrom his back, from which a flexible tube ran into the end of\nthe pistol at his belt. With the surprise of sudden memory, I\nrecognized one of the weapons of the earlier settlers at Marsport: a\nsugarfoot-repelling water pistol, with three-gallon ammunition tanks.\n\n\"We got out the pack, sir, when we returned.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" Baxter interrupted violently. \"You took the dogs and\ntrailed Delvin by scent from his cell. Fine. But did you find him!\"\n\n\"We had trouble, sir. It was outside the crater, and the dogs needed\nair-booster muzzles, which cut down their sense of smell. And the trail\nwas spread way out, too, as if Delvin had only touched the ground every\nthirty feet or so!\"\n\nI remembered Clatclit's bounding transportation from the cell, and had\nto smile. The dogs must have been starting and stopping every five\nminutes over that sporadic trail.\n\nBaxter, at the end of his patience, flattened both hands on the\ndesktop, and grated, spacing his words for emphasis, \"Did you find him?\"\n\nCharlie exchanged a look with Foster, then hung his head. \"No, sir, we\ndidn't.\"\n\n\"Lost the trail, I suppose,\" Baxter growled.\n\n\"No, we kept at it, all right,\" Charlie said. \"It took us underground,\ninto the lava tunnels and grottos. We even found a cot where he'd been\nsleeping.\"\n\nI stared at Clatclit. They'd done better than I thought possible.\nClatclit tilted his head to one side and shrugged. It meant the same\nthing in both our languages.\n\n\"Of course, you idiot!\" Baxter said, with disgust. \"It's obvious he\nhad help from the sugarfeet. I'd have guessed that the moment I saw\nthe intervals of his trail! What else but a man carried by a sugarfoot\ncould travel in bounds like that?\"\n\n\"Gravity here's only half that of Earth,\" Charlie protested weakly.\n\n\"Even so,\" Baxter muttered, \"only an Olympic champ could make leaps\nlike that! You've seen Delvin. Did you really think that gawky frame of\nhis had such galvanic energy?\"\n\nI could resent his slurs later. Right now, I wanted to find out just\nhow damned far those guys had tracked me.\n\n\"But we finally came to a bridge, over an underground river, sir. At\nthe end of the tunnel beyond it, the trail came to a dead end, in front\nof a whole damned wall of parabolite. And something about that wall\nscared hell out of the dogs, too! They were whining, high up the scale,\nlike they do when there's something wrong, and growling at that wall,\nsir.\"\n\nHalfway through Charlie's discourse, I had jerked my head around to\nstare a baffled question at Clatclit. Where, I was about to ask him,\nwere you when the posse scuttled by?\n\nBut he'd already anticipated the question, and I watched as he pointed\nto himself, then made a serpentine forward-stab with his hand, then an\nup-down-and-around motion with his palms over his torso.\n\n\"You scooted up the tunnel for a brisk toweling?\" I said.\n\nA firm nod.\n\nI couldn't blame him. After all, Snow and I were gone for a spell. No\nreason for him to stand there and melt with the water already beading\nhis candy-coated hide. So that meant that Charlie and Foster were\noutside the wall while Snow and I were in council with the Martian. I\nfound I was glad Clatclit hadn't been there to spot them. Because if he\nhad been, and they had those water guns, I'd have found nothing but a\nsticky puddle where I'd left a friend. If, indeed, I'd been able to get\nback that far.\n\nBaxter's voice interrupted my thoughts. \"And so,\" he said, mockingly\nbitter, \"you return once again, empty-handed!\"\n\n\"Not quite, sir,\" said Foster, stepping forward and setting a trim\nplastic rectangle on end atop the desk. \"We found this just outside\nthat wall.\"\n\nIt was Snow's handbag. Probably she'd dropped it in her initial fright\nwhen that wall had gaped open before us. I hadn't noticed it then,\nbecause I'd been pretty shaken, too. And when I made my ungracious exit\nfrom the Martian's now-you-see-it-now-you-don't den, the handbag was\nalready gone, on its way up to Baxter via Foster.\n\nApparently Clatclit had known a shorter route to the IS building than\nthe IS men did.\n\nBaxter had the bag in his hands, now, staring at it with the first\nfaint flush of elation coming into his face. \"But this must be that\ngirl's bag! The one who stole that other Amnesty!\"\n\nIt hit me like a blow in the stomach. Of course! Baxter had had no idea\nthat I was with Snow. Not until now. And he knew Snow had that Amnesty,\nthe one he planned to use to blow the Martians out of our dimension.\nAnd now he knew where she was: deep in the rock of the planet, with a\nvirtual bomb on a chain about her neck!\n\nHe didn't need his gimmicked blouse any longer, the one he was going to\nuse to track me until I was in the chamber of the Ancients. That had\nbeen his plan, of course. The Amnesty was a remote-controlled bomb,\nwhich I, as his dupe, was to have worn during my search for the boys.\nBaxter, knowing that I'd find them, and the Ancients with them, had\nsuggested that I wear that blouse so that he could trail me into their\nlair. Then the flick of a switch, and Jery Delvin would be blasted\nto shreds, while the Martians found themselves stranded forever in\nimmovable Location.\n\nAnd yet I was still puzzled. How could he have known that I'd find\nthem? I decided not to vaporize him just yet. I had a few points to\nclear up, or go out of my mind wondering about for the rest of my days.\n\nI unholstered the collapser, slid the window open with one hand, and\nswung my legs over the sill.\n\n\"Good evening, gentlemen,\" I said.\n\nThey didn't seem very glad to see me.\n\nCharlie and Foster stood stiffly before the desk, watching me warily as\nI completed my clamber into the room. Their eyes widened a fraction as\nClatclit sprang lightly in after me, but that was all. Baxter, however,\nhad lifted one eyebrow, and was appraising me carefully, as if trying\nto gauge the intensity of my emotions. No one said a word for a minute,\nwhile Clatclit shut the window and came to stand a bit behind me, to my\nright, leaving the show to me.\n\nBaxter found his voice first. When he spoke, it was in the casual\nfriendly tone he'd used at our first meeting, his inflection giving\nno sign that I had him covered by the most deadly weapon in the solar\nsystem.\n\n\"Since I am still alive,\" he said dryly, \"I can only assume that you\nwant to see me about something before I die, else you would have\nblasted me through that window.\"\n\n\"That's very accurate,\" I said grimly. \"If you'll tell your men to be\nseated, and to keep their hands where I can watch them, I'll lower this\nbarrel a bit. I wouldn't want an accidental finger twitch to terminate\nour conversation.\"\n\nCharlie and Foster, white-faced, looked at Baxter. He gave a curt nod,\nand they sat down. I stayed back from the desk, keeping my back against\nthe wall beside Clatclit. I didn't want anyone else coming in and\nsneaking up behind me. Baxter swung slightly about in his chair to face\nme, then laced his fingers on his knees.\n\n\"Now that we're settled,\" he said, \"what can I do for you, Mister\nDelvin?\"\n\n\"Baxter,\" I said, \"I just came from seeing one of the Ancients. He and\nI had a long talk.\"\n\nBaxter never flickered an eyelash. He just nodded and waited politely\nfor me to continue.\n\n\"It seems you are a menace to them. They stand in the way of your\nambition, and must be destroyed. However, the Ancients, even with their\nextra dimension, don't seem to have any increase in brain power. Their\nevaluation of your intentions is without doubt the correct one, but as\nto their interpretation of your motives, they're full of hot air.\"\n\nA slight smile of grudging approval appeared on his round face. \"Very\ngood, Mister Delvin. Well thought out. Tell me, just what do they think\nI'm after?\"\n\n\"According to them, you want to be the visible kingpin of the\ntri-planet civilizations, instead of just running things from behind\nthe scenes. For a while, I thought it made sense, too. But then it\noccurred to me that this puppet-control of our worlds is just the sort\nof position that would appeal to you, Baxter. You'd enjoy being the\nsecret master of Venus, Earth and Mars. I could imagine you chuckling\nto yourself, delighting in being an apparent public servant, and\nsaying to yourself, 'The fools; if they only knew--' Am I right?\"\n\nBaxter's smile grew broader. \"In substance, yes. I do rather like being\nthe kingpin incognito, as it were. But go on, you were about to make a\npoint.\"\n\n\"Well, if that were the case, then the Ancients wouldn't have to be\ndestroyed, sent back to their dimension forever. You'd be suited by the\nstatus quo. Alien beings on Mars would just be alien beings on a Mars\nwhich you still controlled. So there's got to be something more that\nyou want. You have all the power I know of, right now. So there can be\nonly one thing left for you to want: some power I don't know of.\"\n\n\"I must congratulate you on your perspicacity,\" he said. \"Yes, there\nis something more, Mister Delvin. That much I will tell you. But as to\nwhat it is--\" He spread his hands. \"I don't see that it's your concern.\"\n\n\"You--\" I said, then paused. His insouciance was not in keeping with\nhis situation. Therefore, the situation was not the one which I\nthought it was. \"You're pretty chipper,\" I said, \"for a man held at\ncollapser-point.\"\n\n\"Oh? Am I being chipper?\" he said, all raised eyebrows and facetious\nwonder. \"I hadn't noticed.\"\n\n\"You fool,\" I said softly.\n\nBaxter's amiable smile vanished and a hard light came into his eyes.\n\"What do you mean?\" he said, through clenched teeth.\n\n\"I mean,\" I said gently, but with deadly earnest, \"that the Brain back\non Earth selected me because of my mental abilities. I mean, Baxter,\nthat I can figure things out faster than you can dream them up.\"\n\n\"The Brain picked you,\" he said coldly, \"because it was rigged by the\nAncients. And for no other reason.\"\n\nI nodded. \"And the Ancients rigged it to pick the man most likely to\nsucceed in your destruction.\"\n\nBaxter was suddenly silent. He watched me intently.\n\nI lounged against the wall, waving the muzzle of the collapser up and\ndown slowly. \"Let me clue you in to my reasoning, Baxter old man,\"\nI grinned. \"This is a collapser. It is in working order. You do not\nfear it. Ergo, you have some protection from it. I would deduce that\nyou are at present wearing a shield of some sort. A shield which you\nhave kept secret from everyone but yourself and the inventor, who is\nprobably long since dead, if I know your approach to things.\"\n\nCharlie and Foster turned and looked at him, their eyes bugging out\nin surprise. Till that moment, they'd thought their weapon invincible\nagainst anything.\n\n\"You astound me,\" Baxter said, admiringly. \"But there's something you\ndon't know about the shield. It protects not by _de_flection, but by\n_re_flection.\"\n\n\"I could have gotten that part figured out, too, if I just allowed\nmy mind to wander a bit through the paths yours seems to prefer.\nNice work. Not only are you protected, but your assailant is himself\ndestroyed.\"\n\n\"And so, Mister Delvin,\" Baxter smiled, starting to get up from his\nchair to come and disarm me.\n\n\"And so,\" I said, \"nothing!\"\n\nBaxter stopped on hearing the easy confidence of my voice. He\nhesitated, looked at me.\n\n\"You shouldn't have kept it a secret,\" I said, smiling. \"Charlie and\nFoster, here, are therefore quite vulnerable to the ray.\" It was\nrewarding to see their increased pallor. \"So, you guys,\" I addressed\nthem, \"unless you want to go out in a blaze of blue sparks, how about\ntying this silly old man to his chair?\"\n\nThey faltered only the fraction of an instant, and then they had a\nfurious, cursing Baxter neatly hooked at ankles and wrists to his chair\nwith their security-manacles.\n\n\"All right,\" Baxter growled deep in his throat, when they had been\ngun-gestured back to their places. \"You are clever, Delvin! So what\nhappens now? Do you beat me to death with your fists, or what?\"\n\n\"If necessary,\" I said. A brief flicker of fear went across his face.\n\"But so far as I'm concerned, destroying you need not mean physical\ndissolution. I don't care so much about Baxter the man as I do about\nBaxter the kingpin. To keep my end of the bargain, I can simply report\nwhat I know to the World Congress, and have you stashed away where you\ncan never carry out any of your totalitarian schemes.\"\n\nThe normal ruddiness of Baxter's face was superseded by a sickly gray.\n\"You can't--\" he said, then stopped. At the moment, it was quite\napparent that I could.\n\n\"And as for your big secret power,\" I said, calmly and without\nboasting, \"it took me about two seconds' brainwork to guess what it is.\"\n\nBaxter just sat and smoldered, his mouth clamped shut.\n\n\"The Ancients,\" I said, \"live in Location, with a capital _L_. I've\nalready experienced a demonstration of their logistic powers. They had\nme bobbing around like a balloon down in their weird little cavern. And\nthey were also able, not so long ago, to manipulate the workings of the\nInternational Cybernetics Brain across a void millions of miles wide.\nThat, by me, shows one power which any would-be dictator would give a\nhell of a lot to get ahold of: teleportation.\"\n\nBaxter stared at me in furious amazement.\n\n\"But,\" I went on, \"there seemed to be a couple of details which didn't\njibe, if that were the case. If they could manage control over cosmic\ndistances so easily, why should they go to the trouble of getting a\nman, me, to bump you off? Why not simply teleport you into something\nfatal? That would be the easier method. But they didn't do it.\nTherefore, for some reason, they couldn't. Well then, Jery, I thought\nto myself, what could the reason be? In their dimension, that of\nultimate Place, or Location, distances have no meanings. Everything in\ncreation is Here. So what held them up? What kept them from snatching\nyou? Obviously, only one thing could, Baxter: the contact-material,\nparabolite.\"\n\nHe kept his features rigid, but sweat was beading his brow. It gleamed\nlike diamonds in the lamplight.\n\n\"It seems that the Ancients can only control areas where their\ncontact-material is present. Until the mineral was found by Earth\nscientists, that place was on Mars only. Then some of the material\nwas taken back to Earth, for museums, for analysis, and even for\npaperweights and such. My guess is that one of the technicians who runs\nthe Brain has a hunk of the stuff on his desk, right?\"\n\nBaxter narrowed his eyes, then relaxed and nodded. \"Yes. As soon as\nI figured out the Brain had been gimmicked, I went there to check. I\nhad it removed immediately. Then I refed the data into the Brain, and\nfound the name of the man who should have been sent here to destroy the\nAncients.\"\n\nI nodded. \"Your own. Philip Baxter. Which is why you sped up here so\ndamned fast after I arrived. And also why you had to toss me into a\ncell. One thing eludes me, though. What gave you the hint that the\nBrain might have been rigged?\"\n\nBaxter smiled wearily. \"Your loss of the Amnesty. When these idiots\nhere called me, my first reaction was to chew them out and to have you\nreleased. It was only after talking to you that it dawned on me that\nyou seemed ill-equipped for the task I had in mind. I got to wondering\nabout the Brain, then. That's when I went over to see for myself, and\nfound the parabolite.\"\n\nI nodded again. \"Yes. In their cavernful of the stuff, they could float\nme all over the place. When some of the stuff was near the Brain, they\ncould control that. But nothing else. Nothing that was not in the\npresence of the mineral. That is, excepting one part of the mineral:\nthe chunk that comprises the false Amnesty. Something had to happen\nto that hunk of it. Something that simultaneously rendered that piece\nout of their control, and told them that you were a menace to their\nexistence in this dimension.\"\n\n\"If you think I'll tell you that--\" he said angrily.\n\n\"No need to. I've figured out that one, too. When I first figured out\njust what parabolite was, I compared it to a rubber ball on an elastic\ncord. Trying to destroy it by force was impossible. It just bounced and\nswung into the cushion of its fourth dimension. But, sticking with the\nanalogue, what happens if the rubber ball is attacked from all sides\nsimultaneously? It has nowhere to go, then. And, I asked myself, what\ncould attack parabolite from even its extra dimension? What, except\nanother piece of parabolite? Oh, not in the frictive way, like diamond\ncutting diamond. You still controlled only three of the dimensions\nusing that method. And it had been tried already by scientists and\nfound useless. So you had to attack it on the no-dimensional level.\nSince the three forms of matter--solid, liquid and gas--all must exist\nwith height, breadth and depth, you had to use the only thing in our\nuniverse that we have besides matter: energy. Fire? No, heat had been\ntried already. Atomic dissolution? A bit better, perhaps; a battery\nof collapsers, working on the subatomic level, had managed to destroy\na fraction of a gram of the stuff, simply from the laws of _chance_\nencounters with parabolite molecules in the fourth dimension. A ray as\npowerful as the collapser-ray undoubtedly accidentally gets generated\nin an extra dimension, but only in the most minor way, not nearly\nenough for your purpose.\"\n\n\"And what,\" Baxter asked between tautened lips, \"is my purpose?\"\n\n\"Since your rule-the-worlds dream necessitates the ability to teleport\nyour agents wherever you please, you must have parabolite wherever you\nplease. This in turn necessitates pulverizing the mineral down to its\nvery molecules, and sowing it into the atmosphere of the three planets.\nThen you will be free to take complete command. The hitch, of course,\nis that the pulverization of parabolite would engender, as the Ancient\nput it, a jolt. A jolt which would unlatch Location from our dimension,\nsending the Ancients off forever. They didn't like the idea, and so\nthey set out to destroy you.\"\n\nBaxter's jaw, during the last part of my narrative, had gone slack, and\nhe stared at me idiotically. I had to grin.\n\n\"Yes, I know what suffering you're going through at this moment, Baxter\nold boy. 'All for nothing,' you're telling yourself. If you had only\nknown, huh?\"\n\n\"You--you mean,\" he licked his dry lips and stared at me, horribly\nupset, \"that all I had to do to be rid of the Ancients was to go ahead\nwith my scheme? Simply pulverizing a hunk of that stuff would have sent\nthem off?\"\n\nI nodded, ironically. \"Yes. No need to rig a bomb, to send me seeking\nthem, to try and set this bomb off in their midst. You could have set\nit off right back on Earth, and been just as rid of them.\"\n\n\"No need,\" he repeated dully. Then, suddenly alert; \"Set it off? How\ndid you know?\"\n\n\"It was the only form of energy that hadn't been tried,\" I said, with\na shrug. \"Self-energy. Back on Earth, you ran that disc of parabolite\nthrough a hot atomic pile, and it became intensely radioactive, since\nthe deadly emanations of the pile are even less than subatomic, and\nhave no dimensions. Then a shielding coating of nullifying gamma\nplasm, the same stuff we use to keep our rocket chambers from dosing\nthe passengers with deadly rays, and neat nickel plate over that.\nEmboss it with the seal of the World President, lacquer it in the\ncolors of IS, and you have a neat, but incredibly potent, little\nfission bomb.\"\n\n\"And how could I set this off?\" Baxter sneered. \"Aren't you forgetting\nthat the parabolite's at less than a critical mass?\"\n\n\"Same way the old H-bomb worked,\" I said. \"Under the gamma plasm,\nbeside the radioactive parabolite, you have an atomic bullet, the kind\nthe foot soldiers used in the Third World War. As for tracking it and\ndetonating it, you must have a refinement of the tracking stuff you had\nin that blouse of mine. As the old H-bomb was triggered by an atomic\nbomb, so the parabolite, even at less than critical mass, could be\ntriggered by the remotely-detonated atomic bullet. You planned to blow\nup the Ancients, and me with them, Baxter. Then you could go ahead and\nset off similar bombs, one each on Venus, Earth and Mars. The fallout\nwould stay with the planets forever, even after losing its potency. And\nyou could teleport your agents anywhere you chose.\"\n\n\"And the Ancients?\" said Baxter.\n\n\"They reasoned out your intentions when you made that chunk of\nparabolite radioactive. Why do that unless you intended detonating\nit? But the very act of making it fissionable somehow took the\nteleportation-whammy out of it. They couldn't use it to snatch you,\neven when you were near it. Probably, since it seems the only likely\nreason, they couldn't use it because it was too atomically hot for them\nto work with.\" I was finished. I waited.\n\n\"Mister Delvin,\" said Baxter, after a long moment. \"What do you intend\nto do, now?\"\n\n\"Keep you in cuffs,\" I said. \"Send an emergency call to the World\nCongress. See you corked into one of your own granite cells. With the\nair supply turned on, however. Though I wouldn't mind you having an\nhour or two of what I went through the other night.\"\n\n\"And,\" Baxter turned his head and nodded toward the handbag on the\ndesk, \"what about her?\"\n\n\"She was being held conditional to my removing you as a menace,\" I\nsaid. \"Consider yourself removed.\"\n\nBaxter smiled. \"And if the Ancients are not satisfied? What if they\nstill desire my death, not simply my imprisonment?\"\n\nI thought it over. \"In that case, I'd be forced to comply with their\nwishes.\"\n\nTo his credit, this unexpected statement on my part only stopped his\ntongue for a moment. He immediately tried a new approach. \"And if the\nAncients decide to destroy her anyhow?\"\n\n\"Why should they?\" I said, less sure of myself.\n\nHe cocked his head to one side, watching me. \"No,\" he shook his\nhead, \"now I think of it, they wouldn't destroy her. They'd hold her\ncaptivity over your head, forcing you to return so that they might\ndestroy you.\"\n\n\"Me?\" I said, startled.\n\n\"Surely you can see why?\" he went on smoothly. \"After all, why were\nthey out to destroy me, Mister Delvin?\"\n\n\"Because you knew--\" I said, then halted, stunned.\n\n\"--How to destroy them,\" Baxter finished for me. \"The selfsame\ninformation which you now possess. What do you think your chances are\nfor survival now?\"\n\nMy guard wavered in that fleeting moment of realization. I caught the\nflicker of movement just a second too late.\n\nCharlie, out of my thoughts for an instant, had whipped his collapser\nout of his holster and brought it to bear on me.\n\nBut even before I could bring my own weapon up in a futile attempt at\na duel which would have resulted in probably two fatalities, iron-hard\nclaws gripped my shoulder and I was carried hurtling to the floor by\nClatclit's full weight on my back. To the floor just behind Baxter's\nchair.\n\nCharlie, spinning about to keep me in range, touched the trigger. There\nwas a shriek. A shriek that died the split second in which it was born,\nand then my world disappeared in a blinding shower of blue-white sparks.\n\nWhen Clatclit and I got up again, Charlie and Foster were missing,\nalong with most of the corridor wall. Baxter was just standing up from\nthe lopped-off remnants of his chair, the manacles at his wrists and\nankles having been dissolved by the bolt which could not destroy him.\n\nThe bolt had rebounded from his shielding force to destroy its\nperpetrator, Charlie, and Foster, the hapless bystander.\n\nBefore I could toss aside my useless weapon and attack him barehanded,\nBaxter had yanked up another weapon from the floor. It was one of the\nold-fashioned water guns, its flexible hose running back to tanks\nfilled with gallons of sugarfoot-destructive fluid.\n\n\"If you place any value on the existence of this creature who has just\nsaved your life, Delvin, you will hand over that weapon to me at once.\"\n\nClatclit looked at me. I sighed, and tossed the collapser to Baxter.\nWhat the hell, it wouldn't work on him, anyhow.\n\n\"And now,\" said Baxter, dropping the water weapon and covering us with\nthe one which was deadly to both our hides, \"I am going to need your\nhelp.\"\n\n\n\n\n19\n\n\n\"Well, this is a switch!\" I remarked. \"The kingpin needs a hand!\"\n\n\"It is a comedown,\" Baxter said wryly, \"but you see, my late agent's\nfatal heroics have had a distressing side effect.\"\n\n\"Oh?\" I said, looking about the shards of room that were still extant\non the corridor side. \"I don't see anything.\"\n\n\"That,\" Baxter remarked, \"is precisely the point, Mister Delvin. A\nmoment or two ago, not three yards to the left of where those fools\nwere sitting--no, don't bother looking, there's only empty space\nthere now--there was a small sending set. I brought it all the way\nfrom Earth with me. In fact, that is the reason I was sitting in this\nroom tonight. Had my agents reported to my satisfaction that you were\npresent among the Ancients, I should have used that set to detonate the\natomic bullet in the false Amnesty. However--\"\n\n\"Your trigger went bye-bye,\" I finished. \"Need I say I am elated?\"\n\n\"I take it the woman, the one wearing the false Amnesty, means\nsomething to you?\" Baxter said. \"The Ancients seemed to set some store\nin her captivity's coercive power over you.\"\n\n\"She does,\" I admitted. \"Which is why I'm happy you no longer possess\nthe means to set that damned thing off.\"\n\nI had no particular love for the Ancients, but I didn't much like the\nthought of Snow being blasted into radioactive rubble.\n\n\"Well, then, if you desire to save her, you and your friend are going\nto guide me down to that cavern where they dwell, and--\"\n\nFootsteps pounded down the corridor, and then a squad of armed guards\ncame into view. They saw Baxter and halted, and their leader stepped\nforward.\n\n\"Sir,\" he said, \"Our detectors reported a collapser being--\" his gaze,\nforgetful of military deportment, took a second to wander bug-eyed\nover the more truncated sections of the room, \"--being used in this\nvicinity.\"\n\n\"Congratulations,\" Baxter remarked sarcastically. \"Your eyes might give\nyou the selfsame information, corporal. One has been used. I have the\nsituation in hand, however. You may take your men and go.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" the young man said, obviously fighting an urge to break\nprotocol and ask what the hell happened.\n\n\"Oh! And corporal,\" Baxter said, as the boy began to organize his squad.\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\n\"You might scratch Myers and Gibson off the payroll list. Send their\nfamilies the usual telegrams of condolence.\"\n\nThe corporal's eyes bugged even more so, and he swallowed noisily\nbefore mumbling \"Yes, sir\" again and departing.\n\n\"That was pretty callous, even from you,\" I said, as the sounds of\ntheir footsteps dwindled and disappeared.\n\n\"Not callous at all. Efficient.\"\n\n\"Callous.\"\n\nBaxter shrugged. \"In any case, come along you two. The sooner I rid\nmyself of these Ancients, the better.\"\n\nThere was nothing else we could do. Dejectedly, Clatclit began moving\noff in his lumbering lope toward the staircase. I followed, no cheerier\nthan he. Baxter brought up the rear. So far as I could see, in\nselecting me as the tool of Baxter's destruction, the Ancients had made\nthe error of their four-dimensional lives!\n\nThen, almost all the way down to the main floor, I heard the murmur of\nvoices. We were nearing the terminal lobby, the point where passengers\nwere checked on and off the planet. As we turned at the landing, I\nsaw that the lobby was filled with a throng of people, some of them\npatiently answering questions of the flight-listing robots, others\nhaving baggage weighed, and still others engaging off-duty pilots and\ntechnicians in casual conversation. It was a normal enough scene, one\nto be found in any rocket terminal on Earth or off it.\n\nBut there was something wrong about it. I slowed my descent of the\nstairs and tried to place the uncertainty, the queasy foreboding I felt\ncentering about my heart.\n\nThen I had it. There were no women present. Not one woman could I see\nin that apparently casual group of passengers. And there was a quiver\nof tingling tension in the air, a very palpable sensation of mental\nconcentration trembling on the brink of action.\n\nBaxter sensed it too. I could feel his own progress slowing behind me\non the stairs. \"What--?\" he said.\n\nThen it happened. At the far end of the immense room, one of the\nsecurity guards let out a cry. I shot my gaze toward the sound, and\nsaw that a man beside him had yanked his collapser from his holster.\nOther guards came alert all over the place, and they started toward the\nman on a run. And they were all of them neatly tripped, shoved, and\nclubbed, while a brilliant crackle of free electrons sealed the fate of\nthe first guard.\n\nThe Neo-Martian revolution was starting. Some of the guards managed to\nget shots off before they were overcome by weight of numbers. People\nvanished in blinding flares of energy, amid shouts of fierce rage from\ntheir companions.\n\n\"There's one!\" someone shouted, and a clump of these desperate\ninsurgents turned toward the stairs, where Clatclit and I stood. They\nwere looking past us, at Baxter.\n\nThen the Security Chief fired the collapser in his hand, the humming\nbolt of dissolving-power buzzing right past my ear. But he hadn't fired\nat the men below. He'd fired directly at the fluorescent fixture that\nglowed in the center of the ceiling. Suddenly, the flash that marked\nits passage was the only lighting in that room. Then the cascade of\nsparks died, and we were standing in blackness.\n\nI grabbed Clatclit's arm, hoping we could make a break for freedom in\nthe dark, but Baxter had out-thought me there, too.\n\nAnother throbbing beam of energy from behind us, and the floor was gone\nbefore our feet, leaving a dizzy drop into emptiness, then even the\nview of the abyss faded as the sparks of energy died. I stifled a cry\nof alarm in my throat as Baxter's free hand flattened itself on my back\nand shoved.\n\nI staggered forward, and my foot came down on air. Then, my grip on\nClatclit's arm throwing him off balance, we plunged into the empty\nspace.\n\nSomehow, writhing in midfall, Clatclit got his hard-scaled arms about\nme, and he took the brunt of the landing on powerful legs and tail. My\nleft arm was numb from shoulder to elbow. I must have struck it on the\nfloor of the room below the lobby when we landed.\n\nAnother thump told me that Baxter had arrived, too. He did better than\nwe did. After all, he was expecting a fall when he took off from that\nsliced-off brink. In another moment, he'd prodded us out into the\ncorridor of that first floor under ground level, where the lights were\nstill working. Then, taking a step back, he blasted away the flooring\nof that room, too, to discourage anyone from following the way we'd\ncome. Incongruously, as he came back out, he shut the door.\n\n\"Afraid they'll grab at the knob on the way down?\" I said, rubbing my\ninjured arm.\n\n\"Neatness,\" said Baxter, not to be outdone, \"is a virtue.\"\n\n\"Come on, come on,\" Baxter said impatiently, waving the muzzle of the\ncollapser at us. \"Can we get to the labyrinth from here?\"\n\n\"Why bother, now?\" I said, jerking a thumb toward the lobby above us.\n\"Way things look, you won't have any empire to come back to, even if\nyou do knock off the Ancients.\"\n\n\"A minor skirmish like this cannot but fail in its purpose,\" said\nBaxter. \"On my return, I fully expect to see the sky filled with\nSecurity ships from Earth, leisurely razing the entire city.\"\n\n\"Won't that be rather difficult to write off as 'Unserviceable,' even\nthe way you keep inventory?\" I needled.\n\n\"Move!\" said Baxter, beyond patience.\n\nClatclit and I moved. We went back down the long ramp that led toward\nthe dungeons. At gunpoint or not, I called back over my shoulder, \"By\nthe way, just what do you intend doing when we arrive at the ogre's\ncastle? I should think that it was the last place you'd want to be\nfound. Kind of like telling off a lion while your head's in his mouth.\"\n\nFar off behind us, there was a growing shout of voices. Apparently, the\nrebels had managed to negotiate what was left of the stairway and were\nhot on our trail.\n\n\"Faster!\" said Baxter, quite unnecessarily. I was in no mood to test\nwhether or not the rebels checked one's ideology before blasting away.\nA disintegrated bystander is beyond apology. So we went faster.\n\nWe reached the dungeon level, and Clatclit proceeded to shove open that\nmovable section of wall. Baxter raised his eyebrows in surprise, but\nthen simply gun-motioned us through the gap. We went, and he followed a\nmoment later. I watched with amusement as he tried vainly to shove that\ngranite mass back into place. I don't know exactly what sugarfeet use\nfor muscles, but it beats what we've got.\n\nAngrily, Baxter stepped back against the curved wall of the tunnel, and\nsaid, \"You! Move that back. We don't want them following us in here.\"\n\nClatclit moved over to obey, while I remarked, \"Why not? Maybe they'll\nget lost. It'll save your city-razing ships a little collapser-power.\"\n\nBaxter ignored my statement, and simply waited until Clatclit had moved\nback beside me, his taillight going on pyrotechnically as the moving\ngranite cut us off from the light in the dungeon corridor.\n\nThen we were once again moving down that frozen-lava slope toward the\ndeeply hidden lair of the Ancients.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs we moved along, side by side, with Baxter coming relentlessly after\nus, Clatclit's hands started working furiously. He flicked an index\nfinger toward me, then toward himself. Then he put the heels of his\nhands together and, after a brief waggling of the fingertips, clamped\nhis hands into fists, and made that serpentine forward jab with one\nhand. He was asking, in his pantomimic way, if he and I, under cover of\nsudden blinkout of his taillight, might scoot off into the labyrinth\nand escape Baxter.\n\nI held up a forefinger and waggled it left and right in a signal of\n\"Better not, chum.\"\n\nHe put his palms up, fingers flipping open in a mute \"Why not?\"\n\nI curled the fingers of my right hand into the palm, then pointed the\nindex finger forward, and lifted my thumb up; an antique Earth gesture\ndating back to the times when hand guns had fanning hammers on them. I\nspun the muzzle of this simulated weapon up, down, and every which way,\nto indicate to Clatclit that Baxter might manage, through sheer blind\nblasting, to polish us off before we got very far.\n\nClatclit slammed his right fist into his left palm in a furious symbol\nof an exasperated \"Damn!\"\n\n\"What are you two plotting up there?\" Baxter demanded suddenly.\n\n\"We were discussing the futility of a lights-out scurry for cover,\nsince that weapon of yours would slice right through these tunnels,\"\nI said, deciding the truth was the best way to avoid suspicious\nrepercussions. \"If your bolt didn't get us, the falling ceiling might.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you're using your intelligence, Delvin,\" Baxter answered.\nThen: \"Why are we stopping?\"\n\n\"Because,\" I said, halting where Clatclit had suddenly paused in his\nforward motion, \"that thunder you hear is the reason the Ancients never\nfind themselves neck-deep in the sugarfeet. An impassable river is up\nahead.\"\n\n\"Impassable?\" Baxter scowled.\n\n\"Not for us, but for Clatclit, here,\" I said. \"He can't even go around\nthis corner without risking deadly corrosion. And, in case you didn't\nnotice back in your office, he's had a pretty nasty exposure already.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" said Baxter, \"I must insist that he either accompany\nus, or be destroyed right here.\"\n\n\"What!\" I said, appalled. \"You can't ask him to do that! He wouldn't\nlast any longer than you would in boiling oil!\"\n\n\"I certainly do not intend to leave him here,\" Baxter snapped. \"He\nmight alert others of his kind, and--\"\n\n\"And what?\" I growled. \"You could fend off a million of them with that\nweapon of yours.\"\n\n\"And risk the ceiling falling in on my head?\" Baxter said. \"No, Delvin,\nI'm not about to take that chance.\"\n\n\"And just how,\" I said savagely, \"did that peanut brain of yours plan\non your getting out of here without him?\"\n\nBaxter paused, his gun hand wavering.\n\n\"Because if he melts in the river, or is vaporized right here and now,\nyou will be stuck without a light. Stuck in a rock-hard maze that you\ncouldn't negotiate alone if you had a light.\"\n\nBaxter just stared, thinking furiously.\n\n\"Of course,\" I went on, \"you could simply aim that thing upward, and\ndisintegrate your way out. But that, too, might make the ceiling fall\nin. And if it didn't, you'd have the small difficulty of climbing the\nglass-sided well you'd created. Climbing, by the way, into the Martian\ndesert, where there is no air, no water, and very little heat. You'd be\ndessicated, suffocated, and a popsicle to boot!\"\n\n\"I--I could very easily slant the bolt into Marsport,\" Baxter\nblustered. \"I could climb the slope easily enough, and there'd be fresh\nair waiting for me, too.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" I mocked, folding my arms. \"Fresh air and a city full of\ninsurgent Baxter-haters. Assuming, of course, that you didn't strike an\nunderground stream in the process, and get washed away into the depths\nof the planet when your hold-off stance with the collapser tired you\nout, when you'd completely dissipated the charge.\"\n\n\"I--\" Baxter said, desperately nervous.\n\n\"And also assuming,\" I continued, \"that you know in which direction\nMarsport is, chum! Of course, you could swing that thing in a full\ncircle of slant-blasts toward the surface, but then that would make the\nceiling fall in, wouldn't it, once you'd cut away all supports.\"\n\nBaxter trembled with impotent rage, but his gun's muzzle was finally\nslumped all the way toward the floor of the tunnel. He was beaten, and\nhe knew it.\n\nAnd that's when I jumped him.\n\nMy still-working right arm shot down and gripped his right wrist, a\nvery awkward stance to take, but my left arm was still weak and useless\nfrom my fall. But Clatclit moved in, then, his rocky talons sinking\nlike so many fangs into Baxter's right arm, all three of us a writhing\ntangle on the tunnel floor, each of us frantically aware that the gun\nhad better not emit any bolts while an arm, leg or tail flailed in\nfront of it.\n\nBaxter shrieked with fear and rage as those steely fingers took hold. I\nthink he was too upset otherwise to feel the pain.\n\nAnd then a bolt buzzed blindingly into the tunnel, and as we all three\nflattened ourselves and waited for the ceiling to come crashing down,\nit spattered into nothingness against the wall.\n\nWe sat up, staring at the spot where the so-called invincible bolt\nhad simply been dissipated, all of us looking pretty silly, flat on\nour bottoms, leaning back on our hands on that curved stone surface,\nmomentarily losing sight of our belligerent behavior of a moment before.\n\n\"The wall!\" I said, first to realize the significance. But I couldn't\ngo on. Baxter finished for me.\n\n\"It's parabolite!\" he cried.\n\nThen my eyes were dazzled by the blaze of light that suddenly\nmaterialized all around us, and my stomach turned over sickeningly as I\nrealized that the converse was probably true: We had just materialized\ninside the dazzling light!\n\nWe were, all three of us, within the metallic-shimmering chamber of the\nancient Martians.\n\n\"Well done, Jery Delvin,\" said a familiar voice, and then the light\nbefore us trembled and warped, and I was looking into the disconcerting\ntriple face of the Ancient again.\n\nI was not, however, in the mood for compliments.\n\n\"Where is my woman?\" I said peremptorily.\n\n\"On your departure, she expressed a desire to inquire further into the\nhealth of her sibling,\" said the Martian. \"She is even now with him and\nhis companions.\"\n\n\"In that cage?\" I cried angrily.\n\n\"I assure you she is--\"\n\n\"Kindly forego the lecture on metabolic stasis and raise the damned\nthing, will you?\" I interrupted.\n\nThe Martian warped and sparkled in a dizzying movement that I could\nonly interpret as a shrug, and then the huge parabolite cage came\nrising up from that not-quite-there flooring.\n\n\"Jery!\"\n\n\"Snow, baby!\"\n\nWe clung to each other awkwardly, and our lips met between the columnar\nbars. I pulled back and called, \"Can't you open this thing up, now?\"\n\n\"Your mission is not quite accomplished, Jery Delvin,\" said the\nMartian. \"The man Philip Baxter is within our realm, but as yet\nundestroyed.\"\n\n\"You mean I've still got to--\"\n\n\"As told you repeatedly: Physical contact between our races is\nimpossible, Jery Delvin.\"\n\n\"Hey, what about that?\" I said. \"After I left here, I got to wondering\nhow, if what you just said is true, you people were able to manipulate\nthe Brain to select me.\"\n\n\"The Brain of which you speak works on a principle of force-fields,\ngenerated by induction coils. We simply placed the right counterforces\nin the right places. No actual contact was necessary.\"\n\n\"Well, damn it,\" I said, after a glance back at Baxter and Clatclit,\nwho were staring bewilderedly toward the source of the voice, \"can't\nyou just keep him here? He's bound to perish from lack of food, or\nwater, or--\"\n\n\"Jery Delvin, the metabolic stasis which I have already mentioned\nto you is not something we used specially for these boys. It is a\nnecessary contingent of our world. Where there is absolute Location,\nthere is absolutely no change of the sort you mentioned.\"\n\nI gave up. \"All right, all right. I won't argue the point. If you could\nget at him, I guess you would. Not a chance of dropping him down a\nhole, or something, though?\"\n\n\"By the very nature of our world, hazardous localizing is an\nimpossibility. Our universe possesses a self-regulatory locale-control\nthat obviates the contingency of perilous placement of an individual.\"\n\n\"Their universe has what?\" Snow asked me, her blue-violet eyes wide.\n\n\"A built-in safety feature,\" I muttered. \"It figures, now that I think\nof it. If Location is absolute, it is One. That means that it's either\nall-safe, or all-dangerous. It can't have a bit of one thing and a bit\nanother. Which means that I'm still carrying the ball.\"\n\n\"Correction,\" said Baxter, behind me, \"you have fumbled.\"\n\nI looked back at him. He had the collapser in his hand yet, despite our\nspace-warping materialization in the cavern. And the muzzle was pointed\nright at Snow's breast, at the Amnesty.\n\n\"Jery!\" she cried, hanging onto my arm.\n\n\"Baxter!\" I yelled, stepping in front of her and flattening myself\nagainst the bars. \"Give us a chance! If that damned thing triggers the\nparabolite, you'll go with us!\"\n\n\"How little you know, Delvin,\" Baxter smiled. \"There are any number of\nfeatures of this other dimension which even your fantastic intellect\nhas not guessed. Did it never occur to you to wonder just where I'd\nlearned the construction of a teleportation machine?\"\n\n\"I--I'd assumed you learned it somehow from the Ancients,\" I said.\n\"Before they realized you intended their destruction.\"\n\n\"I take my hat off to you,\" said Baxter, with a slight nod of grudging\nadmiration. \"I didn't realize you'd thought things out quite that far.\"\n\n\"Hell, it was the only way you could have learned,\" I said. \"But what's\nit got to do with--\"\n\n\"With the fission-bomb?\" Baxter said, smiling. \"Why, only everything.\nYou see, Delvin, teleported matter, in order to bypass distance, must\ntravel in the place where there is no distance: the fourth dimension.\nAnd so, the brunt of the blast will be absorbed by the Ancients, not by\nme.\"\n\nI heard the Martian gasp. Apparently, they weren't aware of this fact.\nIt was more than just displacement they faced, it was death.\n\n\"Your agents,\" I temporized, \"they'd then be using a system that\ntransported them via radioactive chaos!\"\n\nBaxter shook his head. \"Since the transfer is an instantaneous one, I\nrather doubt that they'd absorb any roentgens to speak of.\"\n\nThat seemed to be that. He was set to fire, and I was all out of\narguments. And my stance between Snow and that ray-pistol was only a\nfleeting protection. She'd go about one second after I did.\n\nThen, behind me in the cage, I heard a movement, and Snow gave a little\ncry. I jerked my head about.\n\nTed, with more sense than his sister, had simply taken the Amnesty from\nabout her throat and flung it away. All of us followed its flight with\ndazzled eyes.\n\nBaxter swung up the barrel of the collapser and fired. And in the\nsame instant, the spinning disc halted, and then dodged out of the\ntrajectory of the bolt.\n\nThe Martian was protecting himself in the only way he could: Changing\nthe parabolite-bomb's location.\n\nI crouched involuntarily, clutching Snow's hand through the bars,\nas the life-and-death contest went on. The tiny disc of destruction\nflitted here, there and everywhere, in a dizzying erratic course, while\nBaxter kept the trigger of the collapser depressed tightly, and slashed\nwildly in the eye-dazzling light of that place with the pulsing beam.\n\nI wasn't in favor of the Ancients, exactly, but I was bound and\ndetermined to halt Baxter's reckless blasting with that gun, one flick\nof whose ray would disintegrate me, Snow or Clatclit, not to mention\nthe frightened huddle of small boys in that cage. And there was one way\nto halt him.\n\n\"At him!\" I cried to the Martian. \"He won't fire if it's anywhere near\nhimself!\"\n\nHe must have heard me. The disc skidded to a wobbly halt, and then it\ndove like an eagle toward Baxter in a swift, graceful line. A straight\nline.\n\n\"ZIG-ZAG, YOU IMBECILE!\" I yelled, an instant too late.\n\nEven the poorest shot can track an object moving toward or away from\nhim. Baxter's collapser caught the descending disc a good twenty yards\nbefore it got to him.\n\nMy eyes clamped shut against the monstrous blaze of heat and light.\nThen, Snow's hand tightly gripped in mine, I was enveloped in inky\nblackness, with nothing but empty air beneath the soles of my boots.\nAnd falling.\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\n\"Snow! Darling, are you all right?\" I asked, getting groggily to my\nfeet and pressing her hand between both of mine. The fall hadn't been\nas bad as the one I'd taken earlier through that hole in the floor, but\nit was enough to shake me up.\n\n\"Y-Yes, I think so, Jery,\" she said, pressing one slim hand to her\nforehead, then brushing a wisp of hair back out of her eyes. I took her\ntightly in my arms and held her.\n\nOnly then did I suddenly realize where we were.\n\nThe light came from the trylon tip of Clatclit's tail. It reflected\nin a red glow from the cavern floor, but vanished over our heads into\nan impenetrable darkness. Beyond Snow, I saw the Space Scouts getting\nto their feet. The kids were in much better shape than I was. With\nconsistent bad luck, I'd taken the fall on my injured left arm, and now\nit was throbbing like crazy. Ted came rushing over to us.\n\nThen I remembered Baxter and looked swiftly about. He was nowhere to be\nseen. \"Clatclit!\" I shouted.\n\nMy crystalline buddy came hurrying over to me, his little taillight\nbobbing as he ran. His glittering eyes looked a question at me.\n\n\"What happened to Baxter?\" I said.\n\nClatclit pointed off into the darkness, and made that serpentine\nmovement with his hand.\n\n\"Into the labyrinth?\" I exclaimed. \"But why?\"\n\nClatclit pointed toward the floor. I followed his gesture with my eyes,\nand saw on the rocky ground the reason. The collapser lay there, its\nfiring chamber cracked in half. It was useless as a coercion any more,\nunless Baxter had a good throwing arm.\n\n\"But why didn't you follow him?\" I asked.\n\nDisgusted stare. Clatclit pointed to me, Snow, and then the boys, and\nfollowed with an attention-getting tremor of his tail.\n\n\"Oh, yeah. We would have trouble getting out of here unguided, at\nthat!\" I said sheepishly. When Snow was around, I couldn't even see the\nobvious.\n\n\"Any chance Baxter can find his way out of here alone?\" I said. \"If he\ngets to the spaceport before we do, he may get back to Earth and get an\narmy back here after us.\"\n\nClatclit thought it over. Then he placed an arm across my shoulders,\nand an arm across Snow's, and looked hopeful.\n\n\"Damn,\" I said, not knowing whether to laugh or cry, \"it's mighty nice\nof you to offer, but we can't spend the rest of our lives down here\nwith you, Clatclit!\" I shook my head. \"We've got to get out of here\nand get the word to the World Congress before Baxter sews the Earth up\ntight.\"\n\n\"Say,\" Ted's small voice interrupted, \"what happened to the bars and\nstuff, hey?\"\n\nI blinked, startled, and looked about us. Then, on an impulse, I\ndropped to my knees and felt the ground. It was plain old lava. I\nrocked back on my heels, bewildered, and then I understood, and started\nlaughing.\n\n\"Jery, what is it?\"\n\n\"Snow, baby, it's the laugh of the century, that's all. Unstable\nis hardly the word for the Ancients' universe! Not only did they\ndislocate, but they took their contact-material with them! MY guess is\nthat right now there is no longer a splinter of parabolite in the solar\nsystem.\"\n\n\"But why is that funny?\" she asked, as I got to my feet again.\n\n\"Because, honey, it means that all Baxter's deep, dire and devious\nschemes have come to naught, and by his own hand, at that! He'll never\nbuild his teleportation machine, now!\"\n\n\"His what?\" she said.\n\n\"You see, baby, he--Oh, hell, it's a long story. I'll tell you when we\nhave more time. Right now, we have to head Baxter off, or things won't\nbe very funny at all.\"\n\nFollowing Clatclit's light, Snow, the boys and I moved swiftly across\nthe floor of that vast cavern, emptied of its space-stressed metal\nlining and occupants after heaven knows how many eons of existence\nthere. The only hitch we encountered in our upward race was that\nspray-happy torrent which Clatclit couldn't cross without dribbling\nto death. However, a Space Scout is true, brave, and loyal, and he\nalways carries a rubber poncho inside his travel-kit. It took three of\nthem to swaddle our guide, but, with the assistance of two of the more\nsure-footed Scouts, I was able to tote him bodily across that perilous\nbridge, with nothing showing of him but his taillight, and that high in\nthe air, away from most of the eroding spray. Once unwrapped, he took\nthe lead again, tail high. Then, Snow's hand tightly in mine, we all\ntook off like cross-country racers up those winding tunnels of Mars.\n\nWe emerged on the hillside overlooking the airstrip, from one of\nthose \"Forbidden to Enter\" cave mouths, in the bright glow of the\nsand-converter, towering at the far end of the field. Despite political\nintrigue, insurrection, and the disappearance of the entire Martian\nrace from the solar system, it stood there on its girder legs,\nmonotonously separating the molecules of ferrous oxide into molten iron\nand atmosphere.\n\n\"Things seem to be quiet at the terminal building,\" I observed, looking\nacross the field. \"I wonder who won the battle?\"\n\n\"What battle?\" said Snow.\n\n\"Boy, honey,\" I kissed her lightly on the forehead, \"you are going to\ntake years to bring up to date.\"\n\nTo forestall any more questions, I turned and started off across the\nlanding field, with my alien-plus-female-plus-adolescent group tagging\ncautiously after me. I was just busy wishing I still had my collapser,\nwhen, from a cavemouth to our right, a pallid glow appeared, and then a\nfigure darted out onto the strip, in the glow of the terminal lights.\n\nBaxter! If he got inside first, and IS men were in charge--\n\nBut he hadn't seen me yet. I couldn't just hope for a rebel win. I took\noff like an Olympic sprinter, racing toward that staggering silhouette\nbefore me, my hands outstretched in the hopes of throttling him a bit\nbefore I turned him over to the World Congress. Unless, of course, the\nrebels ruled Marsport.\n\nAnd then one of the more excitable Space Scouts blurted an involuntary,\n\"Get him!\"\n\nBaxter whirled, five feet away from my fingertips. His right hand came\nswinging up toward my face.\n\nAnd then I was coughing, and sneezing, and waving frantic hands at a\nblazing something that engulfed my features.\n\nBy the time I realized it was only tunnel-fungus, and at the same\nmoment realized how Baxter had lighted his way out, he was on his way\ninto the terminal, his old legs whipping like pistons. Well, he'd be\nthe first to see who'd survived the battle. Clatclit and the others\nhad caught up to me, by then, and we moved in a desperate bunch toward\nthose lighted glass doors, in a last hope of getting our man before our\nman's men got us.\n\nAny second I expected a cordon of armed guards to come galloping out of\nthere with collapsers ablaze in our direction. Any moment now, we'd all\nbe separated into hot protons and flying clouds of electronic sparks.\n\nI came to a stumbling halt, and ceased all conjecture.\n\nFor just inside those glass doors, Chief Philip Baxter was standing\nwith his hands raised over his head, and there were men approaching\nhim with drawn weapons. And not the rebels, either. His own security\nguards! IS had won.\n\n\"Hey!\" said Ted, tugging at my arm. \"They must have gotten my message!\nLucky thing the rebels were the losers, hey?\"\n\nI spun about, giving him a dazed look. \"What message?\" was all I could\nchoke out.\n\n\"In the _Phobos II_,\" he said happily. \"I scratched it on the wall over\nmy takeoff rack.\"\n\n\"I didn't see any message,\" I complained.\n\n\"It was in code,\" he explained, with the head-shaking condescension\ntoward an idiot of which only small boys are capable. \"Snow and me, we\nhave a secret code.\"\n\n\"I know that!\" I growled. \"But how in the world--\"\n\nHe gave a lazy what-does-it-matter shrug. \"You probably didn't\nnotice it because you didn't know the code. Otherwise, it looks like\nchicken-scratches. But I was pretty sure a good cryptograph man would\nfigure it out. It's only a substitution code, after all.\"\n\n\"And what was the message?\" I said, repressing a sudden urge to swear\nat him.\n\nTed yawned idly and scratched his stomach. \"I just said: 'Help! We have\nbeen kidnapped by Chief Baxter of Interplanetary Security. Sincerely\nyours, Ted White, Space Scout First Class.' It wasn't the truth, of\ncourse, but I figured it'd get an investigation started. And then\nBaxter's goose would be cooked.\"\n\nBefore I could mutter a small curse, there came a sudden blast of\nenergy from the terminal building, and the glass doors came flying\nopen. I saw a figure come dashing out of there, and realized that\nBaxter was once more on the loose.\n\n\"The shield!\" I groaned.\n\nHis hands-over-the-head had been only a reflex action. I only gave one\nquick glance toward the terminal lobby, where the remaining men were\njust getting their wits about them, then I took off after him again.\n\nIt was going to be a close thing, I realized. He had a good lead on\nme. At the end of the strip opposite to where we'd emerged from the\nlabyrinth stood a ship. It was Baxter's personal ship, marked with\nthe colors and seal of IS. If he once got aboard, he could get away\nforever. But even worse, he could train his ship's artillery-size\ncollapser on the entire spaceport, and blast us all out of existence.\n\nI could see I wasn't going to make it. He was a full hundred yards\nahead of me. By the time I reached the ship, he'd be pressing the\nstarter button, and all I'd get for my efforts would be the searing\nfires of the rockets in my face as the great ship lifted.\n\nThen a bounding, red-glinting form was whizzing past me, covering\nthirty feet at a leap. Clatclit was on the trail of the man who had\nthreatened his destruction back in the labyrinth.\n\nShrill, furious clackings came from within those sharp-fanged jaws as\nthe sugarfoot rapidly closed the gap between himself and the man.\n\nAnd still, something kept me racing across that field, some\nsubconscious foreboding that things weren't finished yet. Then Baxter\ncame to a halt, still twenty yards from the ship, and turned about,\nsomething in his hand from the ship-readying cart. The hose for the\nwater tanks!\n\n\"Clatclit!\" I yelled frantically.\n\nAs if not realizing his danger, the hurtling form of my alien friend\nzoomed down toward Baxter, powerful claws held wide for grasping his\nenemy.\n\nThings happened terribly fast. From behind me, I heard a scream, and\nthen a curse. I staggered, and turned. Snow was wrestling on the\nground with a Security Agent, one of the still-shaken survivors of the\nbacklash of Baxter's shield. Evidently, he'd been about to try another\nshot at the fleeing Security Chief, and Snow, with unladylike good\nsense, had given him the benefit of one of her brother-training flying\ntackles, before we all died in a new rebounding ray.\n\nA wild trilling whistle came from the ship, and I jerked my head about.\nBaxter had let loose with the hose, and Clatclit was rolling on the\nground, in a wild effort to shake the caustic droplets from his melting\nscales.\n\nMy head was spinning. Which was to turn? Snow was in a furious fight\nwith a full-grown man behind me, and my best friend was being dissolved\nbefore me. I didn't know what to do. Should I run and stop her from\nbeing vaporized, or him from being turned into taffy?\n\nBaxter took the decision out of my hands.\n\n\"Delvin!\" his voice came.\n\nI turned back toward him. Clatclit, still shuddering with the shock of\nthat water-spray, was facing me, Baxter behind him with an arm across\nthe sugarfoot's throat. And in Baxter's other hand he held the water\nhose, its pistol-control barrel aimed right at Clatclit's eyes.\n\n\"Tell the others to stand back,\" he shouted, \"or I'll burn your\nfriend's eyes out!\"\n\nBy now, Snow had explained the situation somewhat to the guard, I\nguess, because she and he came abreast of me and stopped, listening to\nBaxter's threat.\n\nThe guard's gun came up swiftly.\n\n\"Don't, you fool!\" I said, my hand clamping on his wrist. \"He's got a\nshield!\"\n\n\"I know that,\" said the guard, whom I suddenly recognized as the\ncorporal who had led his men to investigate the blast in the upper\ncorridor. \"I'm only going to disable the ship!\"\n\n\"No,\" Baxter called. \"If the ship goes, then so do this creature's\neyes!\"\n\nThe corporal looked at me, wavering. \"It's--it's only a sugarfoot,\" he\nsaid, uncertainly.\n\n\"Only a--!\" I shrieked. How could I tell this idiot what I felt for\nClatclit! \"You'll shoot over my bloody corpse!\"\n\n\"We can't let Baxter get aloft in that thing!\" the corporal said\nbeseechingly. \"If he does, we're all dead!\"\n\nI was trembling with fear and frustrated rage. Baxter was backing\ntoward the ship, taking the weakened Clatclit backward with him. They\nwere only a few feet from the entry port, now.\n\nThen my hand went out, and I took the corporal's collapser from him. He\nstared at me confusedly, but let me take it.\n\n\"Everybody hit the dirt!\" I said, lifting the weapon and taking careful\naim. Guard, girl and Scouts took a dive.\n\nI was neither aiming at Baxter, nor his ship. The blazing bolt of\nenergy from the collapser, an instant before I joined Snow, the\ncorporal and the Space Scouts on the ground, went where I'd intended it\nto.\n\nInto the nearest supporting girder of the massive converter.\n\nAs in a slow-motion nightmare, the structure began to tilt with the\nuneven distribution of weight, toward the spot where a supporting\nleg should have been, and then the brightly burning rays of the\nore-converting head came arcing down in a deadly sweep that passed over\nBaxter, Clatclit, and the ship, narrowly missing the spot where the\nrest of us lay. Then the power cables tore away, and the beam went out.\n\nIt was all over. The ship, of aluminum-magnesium alloys, was in\nperfectly fine shape. Clatclit, of pure sugar construction, was, if a\nbit water-sick, alive and healthy.\n\nBut Baxter--\n\nThe converter had been designed with one function: to turn ferrous\noxide, plain old rusted iron, into its components. In the force of its\nray, the oxide became free oxygen and molten iron. And the blood of a\nhuman being is made up of, amongst other things, tiny cells which have\nthe presence of oxidized iron to thank for their bright red color.\n\nWhen we got to Baxter, he was long past screaming. You can't make much\nnoise when you're a solid blister, ten feet in diameter.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Hey, Jery,\" said Ted, on the rocket back to Earth. \"How come you and\nSnow fell in love so quick, hey?\"\n\nI looked from Snow, seated beside me on the lounge, my arm across her\nshoulders, to the viewport, through which I could see the dwindling red\nglobe that was Mars.\n\n\"Well,\" I said, trying to think of an answer.\n\nAcross from us, squatting happily on a specially provided stool, was\nClatclit. As ambassador-elect of the Sugarfoot Nation to Earth, and\nthe first extraterrestrial permitted to land on our home planet, he\nwas mighty proud of his upcoming honor. Clatclit the sugarfoot clacked\nsomething.\n\nI looked at him.\n\nHe pointed to his wrist and shook his head.\n\nI grinned. \"There's your answer, Ted. There wasn't time to fall in love\nslowly.\"\n\nTed stared at the carpet and sulked. I had already, in a post-trauma\nstate of nerves, shattered his composure not a little by angrily\ntelling him that his \"world-saving\" code was really a cipher.\n\nHe'd been unwontedly morose ever since. I felt kind of bad about it,\nbut couldn't find an opportunity as yet of getting his ego back on its\nfeet.\n\nThen Clatclit, resplendent in his new-grown ruby scales, made another\nnoise. I looked at him again.\n\nHe made a back-over-the-shoulder gesture, then tapped his wrist.\n\n\"A while ago ...\" I interpreted aloud for Snow's benefit. And Ted's, if\nhe wasn't too sunken in gloom to listen.\n\nHe put one hand to his throat, and pointed an index finger at his eyes.\n\n\"... When Baxter was holding you as hostage?\"\n\nHe pointed to me, then made a bang-bang gesture with the finger,\nfollowed by a point back over and above his shoulder, toward where that\nconverter had been in relation to himself.\n\n\"Why did I blast the converter?\"\n\nNod.\n\nI stared. \"What else was there to do? It was a little rough on Baxter,\nbut I had to save you, didn't I?\"\n\nSide-to-side headshake.\n\n\"I didn't have to save you that way?\" I remarked.\n\nTed was watching Clatclit with interest, I noticed, his eyes dancing\nwith fascination at this better-than-code means of communication.\n\nClatclit shook his head.\n\n\"Okay, I'll bite,\" I said, puzzled. \"What would _you_ have done in my\nspot?\"\n\nBang-bang gesture. Then serpentine motion with his hand.\n\n\"Shot the ... the lava tunnels?\"\n\nDisgusted stare.\n\n\"Threw a snake at him?\" I hazarded, bewildered.\n\nAbruptly, Ted laughed. I looked at him, chagrined. After all, he\ncouldn't expect me to be at my brightest in the mind-dampening presence\nof his sister, though he was a little young to understand such things.\n\n\"I suppose you know what he means!\" I said.\n\nTed continued to laugh, a high boy-soprano giggle which seemed in\nitself to afford him additional amusement.\n\n\"Okay, okay,\" I said to him. \"Give. What did Clatclit say I could\nhave done that would have spared Baxter and saved him from dissolving\nanyhow?\"\n\nTed managed to squeak out, between gusts of delight, \"Clatclit\nsays that if he had been doing the shooting, he would just have\ndisintegrated ...\" He rolled onto his face on the lounge sofa, and\ncouldn't go on.\n\n\"Disintegrated what?\" I demanded, baffled.\n\nTed snorted, lifting his face to look for the reaction on mine. \"The\nwater hose!\"\n\nI stared stupidly, then broke into a grin.\n\nI decided not to mention to him that a foot-thick metal girder is a\nhell of an easier target than a one-inch diameter of flexible tubing.\nWhat the hell. I had Snow; Clatclit had a whole skin; and--Well,\ngrowing boys need their ego.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Secret Martians, by Jack Sharkey\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE SECRET MARTIANS ***\n\n***** This file should be named 50668.txt or 50668.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/0/6/6/50668/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
