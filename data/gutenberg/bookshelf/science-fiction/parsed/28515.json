After days and\nnights of walking, his legs ached abominably.\n\nTired as he was, he looked around carefully, studying the other\ntravelers who rested near him on the road, peering at the city wall a\nhundred paces away with its shut gate of iron-studded oak. In his\nstomach he felt the hollow ball of dread that had not left him since he\nlanded in Italy.\n\n_I am alone in the land of the infidel._\n\nDawn gave a pink tint to the pale yellow stones of the wall, about twice\nthe height of a man. Above it in the distance, covering the summit of\nthe central hill, rose the citadel of Lucera, surrounded by its own huge\nwall set with more than a dozen many-sided towers.\n\nDaoud's feet throbbed in his knee-high boots. For three days he had\nwalked along the carter's track from the port of Manfredonia on the\nAdriatic coast into the hills around Lucera. Yesterday at daybreak he\nhad been able to see, from a great distance, the outline of the fortress\nemerging from the center of a rolling plain. It had taken him another\nday and a night to reach its gate.\n\nAround Daoud now were dozens of people who had gathered at the gate\nduring the night, mostly merchants with packs on their backs. A few\nfarmers, hitched to carts loaded with melons, peaches, and oranges, had\ndragged their burden over the plain. The more prosperous had donkeys to\npull the wagons.\n\nOne man with a long stick drove six small sheep. And a cart near Daoud\nwas piled high with wooden cages full of squawking chickens.\n\nWalking in his direction was a tiny dwarf of a man who appeared\npermanently doubled over, as if his back had been broken. It seemed to\nDaoud that if the man were not holding his arms out from his sides for\nbalance, his knuckles would almost have brushed the ground. His little\ncart was piled with broken tree limbs, firewood to sell in the city.\n\nThe dwarf lifted his head and grinned at Daoud through a bushy black\nmustache. Daoud smiled back, thinking, _God be kind to you, my friend_.\n\nFrom within the city issued a familiar cry, in Arabic, that tore at\nDaoud's heart: \"Come to prayer. Come to security. God is most great.\" It\nwas the adhan, the cry of the muezzins in the minarets of Lucera's\nmosques. For, though he was in a Christian land, Lucera was a city\nmostly populated by Muslims.\n\nDaoud wanted to fall to his knees, but he was pretending to be a\nChristian, and could only stand and ignore the call to prayer as the\nChristians around him did. He said the words of the salat, the required\nprayer, in his mind.\n\nThe people near Daoud spoke to one another sleepily, softly, in the\ntongue of southern Italy. Someone laughed. Someone sang a snatch of\nsong. When the Muslim prayer ended, they expectantly looked up at the\ntown wall.\n\nDaoud saw two soldiers standing in the tower to the left of the gate.\nThey were accoutred in the Muslim manner, with turbans wrapped around\ntheir helmets and scimitars at their belts. One lifted a long brass\ntrumpet to his lips and blew a series of notes that sent shivers along\nDaoud's spine. With a few changes it could have been the call that had\nawakened him every morning in the Mameluke barracks on Raudha Island in\nthe Nile.\n\nUsing ropes, the other soldier hoisted onto a tall pole a yellow banner\nbearing a black bird with spread wings and claws, and two heads facing\nin opposite directions. The double-headed eagle of King Manfred's\nfamily, the Hohenstaufen.\n\nWith a great squealing of cables and squeaking of hinges, the tall\nwooden door swung wide.\n\nDaoud reached down and picked up the leather pack that had lain between\nhis feet. Leaning forward, he pushed his arms through the shoulder\nstraps.\n\nHe wore draped over his pack a long countryman's cloak of cheap brown\nwool. His tunic and hose were of lightweight undyed cotton. Only his\nhigh boots were expensive. He needed good ones for the long walk from\nthe coast to Lucera. A sword swung at his belt, short and unadorned, the\nsort any man of small means might wear. He had chosen it in El Kahira\nout of a stack of swords taken from Christian men-at-arms during the\nlast crusade.\n\nHe drew the hood of his cloak over his head. Later his blond hair and\ngray eyes would guarantee that no one would suspect what he was. But\nhere in southern Italy, where most ordinary people were dark\ncomplexioned, his appearance might draw unwanted attention.\n\nEven though the sun had just risen, he felt the heat on his back. But it\nwas not the dry heat of Egypt that he had known most of his life. A\nheaviness in the air called forth a dampness from within his flesh. His\ntunic clung to him.\n\n_If a Christian asks me what month this is, I must remember to say\nJuly._\n\nHe brushed the dust from his clothing and fell into line behind the bent\nman with his cart of firewood.\n\nOnce inside Lucera, he would find his way to the inn of al-Kharim. And\ntonight the chancellor Aziz would come to him from King Manfred.\n\nThe line shuffled forward. Three guards were standing in the shadows\njust inside the gateway. They were big dark men wearing long green capes\nover red tunics. Red turbans were wrapped around their spike-topped\nhelmets. Curving swords hung from their belts. A boy in a red tunic and\nturban held a sheaf of lightweight spears.\n\nTheir thick beards reminded Daoud how much he missed his own beard,\nshaved off in preparation for this mission.\n\n_My people._ Daoud felt a sudden warmth at the familiar sight of\nwarriors of Islam.\n\nThe feeling was nonsense, he told himself. These were not his people,\nbut the Saracens of Manfred von Hohenstaufen. Their Arab ancestors had\nonce ruled southern Italy, but the Christians had conquered them over a\ncentury before.\n\nNo, these Muslim warriors were not Daoud's people. In truth, on this\nwhole earth there were no people Daoud ibn Abdallah could truly call his\nown.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOnce he had been David Langmuir, living with his crusader father and\nmother, in a castle near Ascalon by the plain of Gaza. An English\nancestor had been one of the first crusaders in the Holy Land.\n\nJust after David's ninth birthday Geoffrey Langmuir, his father, had\nridden out to war in gleaming mail with a cross of red silk sewn on his\nwhite surcoat. David never saw him again.\n\nSome weeks later the Saracens appeared before the castle, and there\nwere days of thirst and hunger and constant fear. He remembered the\nthunderous pounding at the walls and the dark men in their yellow robes\nand green turbans, their crescent-shaped swords coated with blood. He\nremembered his mother, Lady Evelyn, in her blue dress, running up the\nspiral stairs of a tower. He heard her distant scream. When the Saracens\ndragged him out of the castle, with men being cut down by swords all\naround him and women thrown to the ground by laughing Turks who fell\nupon them, he saw at the base of the tower a bundle of blue linen\nsplashed with red that must have been his mother.\n\nOn their leisurely journey back to the Nile, the Turks forced him to lie\non his belly, and they used him as men use women. He would never forget\nthe needle-sharp tip of a curving dagger touched to his eyeball as a\nbashi with a flowing black beard demanded that Daoud use his mouth to\ngive him pleasure. Whenever Daoud remembered that time, his insides\nknotted and his face burned with shame.\n\nOne day he stood naked on a platform in El Kahira, capital of the\nsultans--the city the Christians called Cairo. A fat, laughing slave\ndealer, who had raped him till he bled the night before, offered him for\nsale.\n\nA tall man with one eye a glittering blue and the other a blank white, a\nscimitar in a jeweled scabbard thrust through the embroidered sash\naround his waist, came forward.\n\nA silence fell over the crowd of slave buyers, followed by whispers. The\none-eyed warrior paid the price asked in gold dinars and without\nhaggling. And when the slaver fondled David's loins one last time as he\ncovered him with a ragged tunic, the warrior seized the slaver by the\nthroat with one hand, forcing him to his knees, and squeezed till he\ncollapsed unconscious in the dust of the marketplace.\n\nDavid was almost mad with terror as the one-eyed warrior took him to his\nmansion beside a lake in the center of El Kahira. But the tall man spoke\nkindly to him and treated him decently. Amazingly, he could speak\nFrench, David's language, though with a strange and heavy accent. He\ntold David that he was called Baibars al-Bunduqdari, Baibars the\nCrossbowman. He was an emir of the Bhari Mamelukes, which meant, he\nsaid, \"slaves of the river.\" But though the Mamelukes were slaves, they\nwere also great and powerful warriors.\n\nBaibars gave David a new name--Daoud--and told him that he had selected\nhim to be a Mameluke. He explained in a firm but kindly way that Daoud\ndid have a choice but that the alternative was a life of unrelieved\nwretchedness as a ghulman, a menial slave. As a Mameluke, Daoud would be\nset free when his training was complete, and he could win riches and\nglory and be a warrior for God and his emir.\n\n\"I have long watched for such a one as you,\" Baibars said, \"who could\nlook like a Christian but have the mind and heart of a Mameluke. One\nlike you could be a great weapon against the enemies of the faith.\"\n\n_But your faith is not my faith_, David, who was to be called Daoud,\nthought, not daring to speak, _and your enemies are not my enemies_.\n\nHis longing to please this man, the first Muslim to treat him with\nrespect, struggled as the years passed with his memories of a Christian\nchildhood. Daoud underwent the training of a Mameluke, and Baibars\nwatched him closely. Daoud accepted Islam and took the common surname of\na convert, ibn Abdallah. He took naturally to the life of a warrior and\ngrew in strength and skill.\n\nYear by year Baibars, too, became more powerful. At last he made himself\nsultan of El Kahira, ruler of an empire that stretched from North Africa\nto Syria. Daoud's hand had wielded the flame dagger of the Hashishiyya\nthat ended the previous sultan's life.\n\nNow, having raised Daoud, trained him as a Mameluke, and educated him in\nstatecraft, having sent him to learn wisdom from the Sufi and terror\nfrom the Hashishiyya, having given him a new name and a new faith,\nBaibars had sent Daoud into the Christian country called Italy.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe stones of the gateway seemed to be marble, unusual for a\nfortification. Daoud noticed large iron rings set at intervals under the\narch. His feet crunched on fresh straw.\n\nThe space under the arch was about ten paces from outer portal to inner.\nOn one side a broad-shouldered official sat at a table. The man glanced\nup at Daoud, looked down at a leather-bound ledger in which he was\nwriting, then raised his eyes again for a longer look. This time the\nbrown eyes met Daoud's.\n\nThe official's grizzled hair formed a cap of curls around his head,\nhiding his ears. He had a thick mustache, black streaked with white. His\nshirt of violet silk looked costly. On the straw beside him lay a huge\ndog, doubtless bred for hunting, with short gray fur, forepaws stretched\nbefore it like a sphinx.\n\n_These people live with unclean animals_, Daoud thought with distaste.\n\nWhen the official leaned back in his chair, Daoud saw the long, straight\ndagger that hung from his belt in a scabbard decorated with crossed\nbands of gold ribbon.\n\nFear tightened Daoud's throat.\n\n_Will this man see through me? Will he guess what I am?_\n\n_Come, come_, he chided himself. _You have gone among Christians before.\nYou have walked in the midst of crusaders in the streets of Acre and\nAntioch. You have landed on the island of Cyprus. You have even gone as\nBaibars's emissary to the Greeks of Constantinople. Commend yourself to\nGod and cast fear aside._\n\nHe visualized what the Hashishiyya called \"the Face of Steel within the\nMask of Clay.\" What he showed this official would be his Mask of Clay,\nthe look and manner of the merchant he was pretending to be. Beneath it,\nunseen, was his true face, a Face of Steel forged over years of bodily\nand spiritual training.\n\nThe mustached man allowed most of the people in line to pass into the\ncity after a few quick questions.\n\nDaoud's heartbeat quickened and he tensed when his turn came to pass.\n\n\"Come here. Lower your hood,\" the man said.\n\nWalking slowly toward him, Daoud reached up and pushed back his hood.\n\nThe official raised thick black brows and beckoned to a guard. \"If he\nmakes a move you do not like, skewer him.\"\n\n\"Yes, Messer Lorenzo.\"\n\nDaoud felt a stiffness in his neck and a knot in his belly. King\nManfred's chancellor, Aziz, had written that Daoud would be quietly\nadmitted to the town.\n\nThe heavyset, black-bearded Muslim soldier took a spear from the boy\nstanding near him and leveled it at Daoud, his face hard.\n\n\"Now then,\" said Lorenzo, \"give us your sword.\"\n\nThis overzealous guard captain, or whatever he was, was paying too much\nattention to him. But to avoid more attention, he must readily\ncooperate. He unbuckled his sword belt and held it out. Another Muslim\nguard took it and stepped beyond Daoud's reach.\n\nMesser Lorenzo said, \"Open your pack and show me what is in it.\"\n\n\"Silk, Your Signory.\" Daoud shrugged the pack off his shoulders and laid\nit on the table. He unlaced its flap and drew out a folded length of\ndeep blue silk and then a crimson one. The shiny cloth slid through his\nlong fingers.\n\n\"I am not a lord,\" said Lorenzo softly, reaching out to caress the silk.\n\"Do not insult me by addressing me incorrectly.\"\n\n\"Yes, Messere.\"\n\nLorenzo took the pack with both hands and shook it. A shiny circular\nobject a little larger than a man's hand fell out. Lorenzo picked it up\nand frowned at it.\n\n\"What is this, a mirror?\"\n\n\"Yes, Messere. Our Trebizond mirrors are famed in Byzantium, Persia, and\nthe Holy Land. I brought this as another sample of what we can offer.\"\n\n\"It is a good mirror,\" Lorenzo agreed. \"It shows me my ugly face all too\nwell.\"\n\nDaoud was relieved to see Lorenzo had not guessed the secret of the\nmirror, that it contained a deadly disk of Hindustan. Thrown properly,\nthe sharp-edged disk would slice into an opponent like a knife.\n\nAt Lorenzo's command, two of the guards searched Daoud briskly and\nefficiently. They even made him take off his boots.\n\nThe fingers of one guard found the chain around Daoud's neck and pulled\non it. The locket Daoud had hidden under his tunic came out.\n\n\"What is that?\" Lorenzo growled.\n\nA chill ran over Daoud's body. Could Lorenzo possibly guess what the\nlocket was?\n\n\"A locket with a holy inscription in our Greek language, Messere.\"\n\n\"Open it up.\"\n\nWith a leaden feeling in his belly Daoud turned a small screw in the\nhammered silver case. Perhaps he should not have taken the locket with\nhim. What would Lorenzo see when he looked at it? The cover fell open,\nand he glanced down at the intricate etched lines and curves on the\nrock-crystal inner face of the locket. When Daoud saw beginning to\nappear on the crystal the face of a dark-skinned woman with accents of\nblue-black paint around her eyes, he looked away.\n\nHe leaned forward to give Lorenzo a closer look at it without taking it\nfrom around his neck. The locket's magic should work only for the person\nto whom it was given.\n\nDaoud heard a low growl. The great hound had risen to his feet and was\nstaring at him with eyes as dark brown as his master's. His upper lip\ncurled, revealing teeth like ivory scimitars.\n\n\"Silence, Scipio,\" Lorenzo said. His voice was soft, but iron with\ncommand. The dog sat down again, but kept his eyes fixed on Daoud.\n\nHeart pounding, he waited for Lorenzo's reaction to the locket. The\nofficial grasped it, pulling Daoud's head closer still.\n\n\"Mh. This is Greek writing, you say? It looks more like Arabic to me.\"\n\n\"It is very ancient, Messere, and the two alphabets are similar. I\ncannot read it myself. But it has been blessed by our Christian\npriests.\"\n\nLorenzo let go of the locket and glowered at him.\n\n\"What Christian priests? Where did you say you are from? What is your\nname?\"\n\nWith deep relief Daoud stepped back from Lorenzo, snapped the locket\nshut, and dropped it back inside the collar of his tunic.\n\n\"I am David Burian, from Trebizond, Messere.\"\n\n\"Trebizond? I never heard of it,\" said the mustached man.\n\n\"It is on the eastern shore of the Black Sea.\"\n\n\"You have come such a great distance with only a few yards of silk and a\nmirror in your pack? Would you have me believe this is how you expect to\nmake your fortune?\"\n\nDaoud reached deep in his lungs for breath. Now he would see whether the\nChristians would believe the story he and Baibars had devised.\n\n\"Messere, my city, Trebizond, lies on the only road to the East not cut\noff by the Saracens. A few brave merchants come from the land called\nCathay bearing silk and spices. The samples I have brought with me,\ndoubtless you can see, are of the highest quality. We can send you many\nbales of such silk overland from Trebizond to Constantinople, then by\nship to your port of Manfredonia. I am here to arrange this trade.\"\n\n\"Arrange it with whom?\"\n\nDaoud hesitated. He had come to Lucera to meet with King Manfred. If,\nthrough some mistake, he should fall into the wrong hands, he would try\nto get word to the king that he was there.\n\n\"Your local merchants, your royal officials,\" he said. \"Even your King\nManfred, if he wishes to talk to me.\"\n\n\"So, a dusty peddler comes to our city gate and wants to speak with the\nking.\" He turned to the guard with the spear. \"Take him to the\ncastello.\"\n\nDaoud molded the Face of Clay into an expression of naive wonderment.\n\"The castello? Where King Manfred is?\"\n\nLorenzo grinned without mirth. \"Where King Manfred's _prison_ is, my\nman. Where we hang the people sent by the pope to murder King Manfred.\"\n\nLorenzo's eyes were hard as chips of obsidian, and when he said the word\n_hang_, Daoud could feel the rough rope tightening around his neck.\n\nBut he was more angry now than frightened. His jaw muscles clenched. Why\nhad Aziz not made sure there would be no mistake like this?\n\n\"Why are you doing this to me, Messer Lorenzo? I mean no harm.\"\n\n\"And I intend to see to it that you _do_ no harm in this place, Messere\nof Trebizond,\" Lorenzo shot back. He waved to the guard. \"To the\nguardroom, Ahmad.\"\n\n_May a thousand afrits hound this infidel to his death_, thought Daoud\nangrily. \"And what will you do with me, Messer Lorenzo?\"\n\n\"I will examine you further at my leisure, after I have passed all these\ngood people into the city.\" One violet-sleeved arm made a flowing\ngesture toward the waiting throng.\n\nDaoud noticed that the tiny firewood seller, who had already passed by\nthe guards, had paused at the inner portal. He shook his head sadly and\ntouched forehead, shoulders, and chest in that sign Christians made to\nrecall the cross of Jesus, their Messiah.\n\n_Why, I believe he is praying for me. That is kindly done._\n\nAhmad, the guard, pointed his spear at Daoud and jerked his head. Daoud\nstood his ground.\n\n\"What of my silk? If you keep it, I will truly have no honest business\nin Lucera.\"\n\nLorenzo smiled. He stuffed the lengths of silk and the mirror back into\nthe pack and held it out to Daoud.\n\n\"There is not enough here to be worth stealing. Take it, then.\"\n\n\"And my sword?\"\n\nLorenzo laughed gruffly. \"Forget your sword. Take him away, Ahmad.\"\n\nThey had missed the precious object hidden in a pouch tied in his groin.\nAnd they missed the Scorpion, the miniature crossbow devised by the\nHashishiyya, its parts concealed in the hem of his cloak. Nor did they\nhave any idea that the tie that held his cloak at the neck could be\npulled loose to become a long strangling cord, flexible as silk and hard\nas steel.\n\nDaoud pulled his hood back over his head, shrugged into the pack under\nhis cloak, and began walking. Every step he took sent a jolt of anger\nthrough his body. He would like to use his strangling cord on the man\nresponsible for this blunder.\n\nThe news might well travel northward that a blond merchant had been\narrested trying to enter Lucera. And if that man should later appear at\nthe court of the pope, there might be those who would remember hearing\nof him and wonder why he had gone first to the pope's enemy, Manfred von\nHohenstaufen.\n\nHis first feelings of anger became a cold turmoil in his belly as he\nthought what could happen if his mission failed--El Kahira leveled, its\npeople slaughtered, Islam crushed beneath the feet of barbarian\nconquerors.\n\nHe must not let that happen.\n\nThe narrow street he walked on was lined with circular houses, their\nbrick walls a warm yellow color. The conical roofs were covered with\nthin slates.\n\nA Muslim sword maker looked up from his forge to stare at Daoud and his\nguard as they passed. Veiled women with red pottery jars on their heads\nstopped and looked boldly into his eyes.\n\nDaoud lifted his gaze to the octagonal central tower of the citadel,\nbright yellow-and-black flags flying from its battlements. Instead of\nbeing squared off, the battlements were topped by forked points, like\nthe tails of swallows, proclaiming allegiance to the Ghibellini,\npartisans of the Hohenstaufen family, enemies of the pope.\n\nCloser to the citadel, noises of men and animals came at Daoud from all\ndirections. He saw many buildings, all connected with one another, their\nsmall windows protected by iron grillwork. To his right, in a large\ngrassy open field, a hundred or more Muslim guards in red and green were\nswinging their scimitars as an officer on a stone platform called out\nthe count in Arabic. Daoud and his guard passed by a second yard, where\nstill more Muslim soldiers were grooming their slender Arab horses.\n\nA pungent smell of many beasts and fowl pent up close hung in the warm,\ndamp air. Another row of buildings echoed with the shrieks of birds.\nFalconers in yellow-and-black tunics walked up and down holding wicker\ncages. As he peered into a doorway, Daoud saw the golden eyes of birds\nof prey gleaming at him out of the shadows.\n\nThe sun was high by the time they came to the gateway of the castello.\n\n_Well, so far they have taken me where I wanted to go_, Daoud thought\ngrimly.\n\nThe entry hall of the castello was a large, vaulted room, as Daoud had\nexpected. He had studied the citadel of Lucera before leaving Egypt, as\nhe had studied many other strongholds in Italy, memorizing building\nplans and talking at length with agents of the sultan who had been\nthere.\n\nA strange, almost dizzying sensation came over Daoud. He recognized the\nfeeling, having had it several times before when, in disguise, he\nentered Christian fortresses. As he gazed around the shadowy stone hall,\nits gloom relieved by shafts of light streaming in through high, narrow\nwindows, he seemed to be seeing everything through two pairs of eyes.\nOne pair belonged to a Mameluke warrior, Daoud ibn Abdallah, scouting an\nenemy stronghold. The other eyes were those of a boy named David\nLangmuir, to whom a Christian castle had been home. And, as always on\nsensing that inner division, Daoud felt a crushing sadness.\n\nAhmad took Daoud through a series of small, low-ceilinged rooms in the\nbase of the castle. He spoke briefly to an officer seated at a table,\ndressed like himself in red turban and green tunic. He gestured to a\nheavy-looking door reinforced with strips of iron.\n\n\"In there, Messer David.\"\n\nEvery muscle in Daoud's body screamed out in protest. As part of his\ninitiation into the Hashishiyya, he had been locked in a tiny black\nchamber in the Great Pyramid for days, and, except for the deaths of his\nmother and father, it was the worst memory of his life. Now he ached to\nstrike down Ahmad and the other Muslim soldier and flee.\n\nInstead, he said quietly, \"How long will I have to wait?\"\n\nAhmad shrugged. \"God alone knows.\" Ahmad's southern Italian dialect was\nas heavily accented as Daoud's own.\n\n_How surprised he would be if I were to address him in Arabic._\n\n\"Who is this man who orders me imprisoned?\" Daoud demanded.\n\nAhmad and the other guard shrugged at the question. \"He is Messer\nLorenzo Celino of Sicily. He serves King Manfred.\"\n\n\"What does he do for King Manfred?\"\n\n\"Whatever the king tells him to.\" Ahmad smiled at Daoud and gestured\nagain at the ironbound door. \"Thank you for making the work of guarding\nyou easy. May God be kind to you.\"\n\nDaoud bowed in thanks. Remembering the proper Christian farewell, he\nsaid, \"Addio.\"\n\nThe other soldier unlocked the door with a large iron key, and Daoud\nwalked reluctantly into a shadowy room. The door slammed shut behind\nhim, and again he went rigid with his hatred of confinement.\n\nThe walls had recently been whitewashed, but the little room stank\nabominably. The odor, Daoud saw, came from a privy hole in one corner,\nwhere large black flies circled in a humming swarm. Half-light came in\nthrough a window covered with a black iron grill whose openings were\nbarely wide enough to push a finger through. Noticing what appeared to\nbe a bundle of bedding against a wall, Daoud approached it and squatted\ndown for a closer look. He prodded it, feeling straw under a stained\ncotton sheet. At his probing, black dots, almost too small to see, began\nmoving about rapidly over the sheet.\n\nDaoud crossed the room, unslung his pack from his back, and dropped it\nto the floor. He sat down on the flagstones, as far from the bedding and\nthe privy opening as he could get, his back against the wall, his knees\ndrawn up, like a Bedouin in his tent.\n\n_I am helpless_, Daoud thought, and terror and rage rose up in him like\ntwo djinns released from their jars, threatening to overwhelm him. He\nsat perfectly still. To bring himself under control, he began the\ncontemplative exercise his Sufi teacher, Sheikh Saadi, called the\nPresence of God.\n\n\"God is everywhere, and most of all in man's heart,\" Saadi had said, his\nold eyes twinkling. \"He cannot be seen or heard or touched or smelled or\ntasted. Therefore, make your mind as empty as the Great Desert, and you\nmay converse with God, Whose name be praised.\"\n\nDaoud touched the farewell present Saadi had given him when he left El\nKahira to begin the journey to Italy. It was a leather case tied around\nhis neck, and it contained a piece of paper called a tawidh, an\ninvocation whose words were represented by Arabic numerals.\n\nLike the locket, it would arouse curiosity if someone searching him\nfound it. But it could be simply explained as one of those curious\nobjects a traveler from distant places might have about his person.\nAnd, like the locket, it was simply too precious _not_ to be worn.\n\nSaadi said the tawidh would help wounds heal faster. Daoud refused to\nlet himself think about wounds. He tried to make his mind a blank, and\nin the effort he forgot for a time where he was.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nMesser Lorenzo Celino of Sicily strode into the cell. He held in his\nhands a large round slice of bread heaped with steaming slivers of meat\nthat gave off an unfamiliar but succulent smell.\n\nDaoud slowly climbed to his feet. The hound Scipio, trailing Celino,\nwatched him, standing in the doorway, as if unwilling to enter the\nvile-smelling chamber.\n\nDaoud measured Celino. The top of the Sicilian's head would come to\nDaoud's chin, but the shoulders under his violet tunic were broad and\nstraight, and he moved with menacing grace. Daoud judged that, though\nCelino must be close to fifty, he would be quick and deadly with hands\nand feet, and a good swordsman as well.\n\n\"God's beard, man, I didn't mean to keep you sitting in this room all\nday without food or drink,\" Celino said. \"The damned farmers and traders\nkept coming and coming. But you cannot eat in this stinking place. Come\nout.\"\n\nDaoud emerged into the next room, and Lorenzo motioned him to sit at the\nguards' table. Even though Daoud felt deep relief at being out of the\ncell, he sensed he was in greater danger than before. His mouth went dry\nand the palms of his hands turned cold as his eyes scanned the room for\nweapons or an escape route.\n\nLorenzo set the trencher and its burden of meat down before Daoud.\n\n\"Just butchered. Here, eat in good health. And here is a beaker of our\ngood red wine of Monte Vultura.\" Daoud heard a false note in Celino's\npresent heartiness and liked it even less than his earlier gruff\nsuspicion.\n\nWine. An abomination forbidden by the Prophet. As Celino set a pitcher\nand two cups down on the table, Daoud recalled the nights he had spent\nwith Sheikh Saadi learning to master wine and other drugs.\n\n_God prohibits the drinking of wine and the eating of unclean foods, not\nfor His good, for nothing can harm Him, but for our good. Therefore,\nwhen a man goes among the infidel as a spy, God permits him to eat and\ndrink the forbidden things lest he be discovered and put to death. You\nmust learn to separate your mind from your body so that what harms your\nbody will not affect your mind._\n\nDaoud raised the cup, wondering if he would have as much power over wine\ndrunk in the land of the infidel as he did when he drank it with his\nteacher. He sipped. The red liquid was thick and bitter and burned his\nmouth, but he made himself smile, sigh appreciatively, and sip again. He\nkept God at the center of his thoughts.\n\nCelino was watching him closely. Raising his cup in salute, he also\ndrank.\n\n\"Good, good. Now eat. Fresh roasted. Pork.\"\n\nDaoud's fingers, poised over the meat, stopped short. Already made ill\nby hunger, by the vile odor of the room in which he had been confined,\nand by the wine that made his stomach churn, he felt himself on the\npoint of vomiting. For nearly twenty years the prohibition against\neating the flesh of pigs had been impressed upon him until the very\nthought of pork made him sick. He knew he should have prepared himself\nby eating it before he left El Kahira, but he had never found time for\nthat. So now, a prisoner of the enemy, he faced for the first time the\ntest of pork.\n\nCelino was watching him with a half smile.\n\n_He would not test me with wine and pig's meat unless he suspected I am\na Muslim._\n\nDaoud's fingers grasped a slice of the hot meat. He tore it in half,\nusing both his clean right hand and his unclean left as a non-Muslim\nwould.\n\nHe stuffed a slice of pork into his mouth. It had smelled good until he\nfound out what it was. Now it seemed slimy and tasteless. His stomach\nclenched, but he held himself rigid, expressionless. He started to chew,\nand found that his mouth was dry. His life might depend on his giving a\nconvincing imitation of pleasure. He chewed the meat to fragments and,\nas though savoring it, swallowed the abomination crumb by crumb.\n\nHe realized he was still holding the other scrap of pork in his left\nhand. To give himself a respite, he tossed it to the flagstone floor\nbefore Lorenzo's hound.\n\nUnclean to the unclean, he thought.\n\nScipio looked at Daoud with an almost human look of surprise, then bent\nto devour the meat.\n\n\"Friday, Scipio,\" said Celino sharply. \"You are forbidden meat.\"\n\nThe dog looked sadly up at Celino, licked its chops, and sat back on its\nhaunches, leaving the meat untouched. In spite of his predicament, Daoud\nlaughed.\n\n\"You see?\" said Celino. \"Even a dog can learn to obey the commandments.\"\n\nCelino gestured to the dog. \"All right, Scipio, the bishop of Palermo\ngives you a dispensation.\"\n\nThe dog stood and struck at the meat with his long muzzle. It vanished\nto the accompaniment of loud gulping sounds.\n\n\"He likes it better than you do,\" Celino said. \"You do not act very\nhungry for a man who has not eaten all day. Come on, man, fill your\nbelly.\"\n\nRealizing that the pork would taste worse as it cooled, Daoud braced\nhimself and stuffed piece after piece into his mouth, chewing and\nswallowing as rapidly as he could.\n\n\"And,\" said Celino, watching him with narrowed eyes, \"a dog can be\ntrained to break the commandments when permitted.\"\n\nFrom time to time Daoud threw a scrap to Scipio, grateful for the\nhound's help. But as he ate, Daoud noticed that the meat began to taste\nbetter to him, and the juices of his mouth began to flow. The familiar\nfeeling of sorrow came over him, and he looked around at the white walls\nand ceiling, the wooden beams overhead painted blue. In his mind's eye\nhe saw in their place yellow stone walls and a vaulted ceiling, and\nremembered that he had last tasted the flesh of pig at table with his\nfather and mother.\n\nHe wiped his mouth with his sleeve and sat back. \"Thank you. I feel\nbetter now.\"\n\nCelino stood up, took the stale disk of bread, and dropped it to the\nfloor. Scipio picked it up in his mouth.\n\n\"Then have the goodness to accompany me to the Hall of Mars, Messer\nDavid,\" he said, and turned.\n\n_He shows me that he is not afraid to turn his back_, Daoud thought,\npicking up his pack and following Celino. The Hall of Mars, he\nremembered, was an indoor exercise hall for Manfred's troops. They\nclimbed stairs and walked through rooms in which Muslim soldiers were\ncleaning and polishing helmets, coats of mail, and weapons. In one room,\nmen were painting shields. All the shields were yellow and bore the\nblack two-headed eagle of the Hohenstaufens.\n\nDaoud followed Lorenzo into a very large, bare room with a floor of\npolished hardwood. Ropes and chains hung from the walls and the beamed\nceiling. Tall windows cut high up in smooth walls--too high to jump\nto--let in afternoon sunlight and fresh air that did not quite dispel a\nheavy odor of sweat. Opposite the doorway through which they passed was\nanother and larger entrance, with double doors. The room was not square;\nthe walls were of differing lengths and set at angles. Daoud recalled\nthe octagonal shape of Castello Lucera's central tower.\n\nHe reviewed the plan of the castle he had committed to memory in El\nKahira. He was sure that behind the double doors was the great royal\naudience hall. The wide doorway would allow troops assembled in the Hall\nof Mars to march into the audience chamber for a review.\n\nDaoud noticed a group of Muslim guards lounging in one corner. At\nLorenzo's entrance they touched their hands to their turbans in salute.\nLorenzo responded with the same gesture. Scipio carried the trencher in\nhis mouth to a corner of the room, where he lay down and began pushing\nthe hard bread around with his forepaws and, working at it with his\nformidable teeth, making loud crunching noises.\n\nCelino led Daoud to the center of the room. He turned suddenly on Daoud.\n\n\"Now, spy, you will tell me exactly who you are and exactly where you\ncome from,\" he said rapidly. \"You will tell me the truth, or you will\ndie here and now.\"\n\nDaoud came within a breath of answering, then realized Lorenzo had\nspoken in Arabic. Relieved laughter bubbled up toward his throat--he had\nnot been caught. He choked it down and assumed a puzzled expression.\n\n\"I do not understand,\" Daoud said in Italian. \"What tongue are you\nspeaking, Messer Lorenzo?\"\n\n\"Liar,\" said Lorenzo, still in Arabic, his eyes narrowing.\n\n\"I understand Italian, Greek, and, of course, the speech of Scythia,\"\nsaid Daoud. \"If you would question me, speak in one of those tongues.\"\nDaoud sensed that the Sicilian's sudden shifts of mood were calculated.\nWhile his mouth uttered accusations, Celino's eyes watched him with a\ncalm intelligence that reminded Daoud of an emir examining a\nfine-looking horse for hidden flaws.\n\nDaoud saw, at the edge of his vision, that the guards who had been\nlounging in the corner of the hall were now in motion. He glanced\nquickly left and right. Three men, about fifty paces away, were coming\nat him, curved swords drawn. The dog, Scipio, had abandoned the trencher\nand risen to his feet, and he, too, was advancing on Daoud, fangs bared.\n\nLorenzo stepped away from Daoud, still pointing at him.\n\n\"Spegni! Kill!\"\n\nTension crackled across Daoud's stomach like a lash. Three swords, and a\ndog that looked capable of killing a man. None of the weapons he had\nhidden on him would do for this. He slung his pack toward the wall\nbehind him, leaving both hands free.\n\nHe half turned, to keep Lorenzo in sight while watching the advancing\nmen. The Sicilian had a long dagger in a scabbard hung by his right\nside, but he did not draw it.\n\nFacing the three swords, Daoud had not yet raised his hands. But his\nlegs tensed. He bent at the knees, shifted his weight to the balls of\nhis feet.\n\nHe whirled and sprang at Lorenzo. The Sicilian jumped backward, and\nDaoud could hear behind him the pounding of booted feet on the wooden\nfloor. The dog barked furiously.\n\nDaoud grappled with Lorenzo. The Sicilian grabbed his forearms, trying\nto hold him at a distance, and his strength was almost a match for\nDaoud's. But Daoud twisted his arms free, drove in, and caught Celino's\nneck in the bend of his left arm. He swung him around so that the\nSicilian's body was between himself and the three attacking soldiers.\nWhile Lorenzo stumbled, Daoud plucked the man's dagger out of its\nscabbard. It had two sharp edges and came to a diamond-bright point.\n\nScipio leapt at him, but Daoud shifted Lorenzo between himself and the\nhound, and Scipio fell back. His enraged barking was deafening, like the\nroar of a lion. His fangs were a row of bone spear-points. He danced\nright and left, seeking a way to get past Lorenzo to Daoud.\n\nThe joy of battle, the weapon in his hand, made Daoud feel the power\ncoursing through his arms. But that damned dog had to be stopped. His\nteeth were as dangerous to Daoud as the curving blades of the three\nMuslim soldiers. Those fangs could rip through his boots, tear the\nmuscles of his legs, and cripple him. He would prefer death.\n\nReleasing Lorenzo's neck, Daoud gripped Lorenzo's wrist and twisted,\nhard and fast. Biting his lip, Lorenzo resisted, but he had to turn and\nbend, or the pressure on his arm would break it. Daoud laid the edge of\nLorenzo's dagger against his throat.\n\n\"Call off your dog or I cut your throat.\" Daoud glanced over his\nshoulder to make sure no one was behind him.\n\n\"By all means cut my throat,\" Lorenzo flung back at him. \"And Scipio\nwill tear _your_ throat out.\"\n\n\"If the dog jumps at me, I will gut him.\"\n\n\"The devil roast your balls,\" Lorenzo growled. \"Scipio, sit!\"\n\nThe hound stopped barking and stared at Lorenzo.\n\n\"Down, Scipio!\" Lorenzo said. \"He will not hurt me.\" To Daoud he said,\n\"If you do hurt me, you will suffer such things that you will beg us to\nkill you.\"\n\nScipio reluctantly crouched, murder in his brown eyes and a steady, low\ngrowling issuing from his throat. The three Muslim guards were still\nmoving forward, far more warily.\n\nDaoud felt strong and able now to deal with these four men, but he could\nalmost feel the weight of the overwhelming trap he was in. The thick\nwalls. The thousands of soldiers. It was hopeless. He could fight on\nonly until he died. And that was not what he had come here for at all.\n\nDaoud stepped back toward the farther doorway, pulling Lorenzo with him.\nHe glanced over his shoulder to be sure no one was behind him.\n\n\"For my part,\" said Daoud, \"I will hurt you till you beg _them_ to put\ndown their swords. I will start by breaking your arm.\" He gave the\ntwisted arm a vicious upward push till he could almost feel the agony of\nthe tendons. Lorenzo grunted, and Scipio barked angrily. Most men, Daoud\nthought, would have screamed aloud at that.\n\n\"No matter what you do to me, it will not help you,\" said Lorenzo.\n\nThree more turbaned Muslim soldiers joined those coming at Daoud. They\nspread out in a wide circle, some of them trying to slip around to his\nrear.\n\n\"Stand where you are, or I'll kill him,\" Daoud shouted. To show he meant\nit, he pressed the knife edge hard against Celino's throat and sliced\nwith it just enough to draw blood.\n\n\"I hope you will enjoy the taste of your own intestines,\" Lorenzo said.\nHe dug his boot heels into the wooden floor, trying to slow down Daoud's\neffort to drag him to the door. Daoud pushed up harder on his arm to\nmake him move faster.\n\nDaoud felt no fear of death, and he would not let them take him prisoner\nto torture him. He would die fighting. And go straight to paradise.\n\nBut how foolish all this was. A waste of his own life and the lives he\nwould take with him. And many of those he would kill were Muslims, like\nhimself.\n\n\"You must know that you will be the first to die here,\" he said. \"And\nbelieve me I will take many of your men with me. I may even manage to\nkill your precious dog. I did not come here to fight with King Manfred's\nmen. Why are you doing this?\"\n\nCelino, who had been struggling against Daoud, now relaxed and turned\nhis head. \"You are too dangerous to live.\"\n\n\"Dangerous to whom?\"\n\n\"To me,\" said a deep voice behind Daoud.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nDaoud turned, dragging Celino. A blond man stood, hands on hips, eyeing\nhim with a faint smile. One of the big doors leading into the royal\naudience chamber was slightly ajar. Daoud was angry at himself for\nletting someone slip up behind him unnoticed.\n\n\"Sire, get back!\" Lorenzo shouted.\n\n_Sire._ Daoud knew at once who this was. The same height as Lorenzo, as\nDaoud now saw, the man had the very broad shoulders Christian knights\ndeveloped from wielding their huge two-handed swords. Daoud guessed his\nage at a little over thirty. His hair, so blond it was almost silver,\nhung in soft waves below his ears, curling at the ends. His silver-blond\nmustache was carefully trimmed. His eyelids crinkled with amusement. He\nwore a tunic of lime-colored silk under a short forest-green cloak\ntrimmed with white fur. His hose and boots were also shades of green.\nFrom a chain around his neck hung a five-pointed silver star with a\nspherical ruby in its center. In every point he fit the description\nDaoud had been given.\n\nThe despair Daoud had been feeling a moment before gave way to a\nprofound relief. It had seemed that everything stood in the way of his\nmeeting this man, and now at last they were face-to-face.\n\n\"Sire,\" Daoud said in Italian, \"I know who you are, and you must know\nwho I am.\"\n\n\"I do indeed,\" said Manfred von Hohenstaufen, still smiling. \"Please\nrelease Messer Lorenzo.\"\n\nDaoud hesitated only a moment. But if Manfred allowed Lorenzo to hurt\nhim now, the mission was a failure anyway. Tensed for attack, he let go\nof Lorenzo, who sprang away.\n\nIn an instant the Sicilian had taken a curving Islamic sword from a\nsoldier.\n\n\"Sire, at least move back from him,\" Lorenzo said. \"You know what we are\ndealing with here.\"\n\n\"Quiet, Lorenzo,\" snapped Manfred. \"What we are dealing with is a\npeddler from some misty land beyond the Black Sea who happens to be\ninfernally nimble. That is all.\"\n\nDaoud was pleased to hear Manfred go along with his disguise. He relaxed\na bit and eyed the king of southern Italy and Sicily. A splendid-looking\nman with a charm that Daoud felt after only a moment's acquaintance.\n\n\"Will the peddler be so kind as to return my dagger?\" Lorenzo asked with\nheavy irony. \"This side of the Black Sea it is considered discourteous\nto stand in the king's presence holding a naked weapon.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Daoud, holding the dagger by its guard and handing it\nhilt-first to Lorenzo, who in turn gave the Saracen soldier back his\nsword.\n\nDaoud was glad he had not had to kill Lorenzo. The Sicilian, like his\nmaster, Manfred, was clearly a man above the common run. His behavior\ntoward Daoud so far had been a series of clever pretenses. Indeed, Daoud\nwas sure he had not gotten to the bottom of Lorenzo yet.\n\n\"I thank you for entertaining us with this display of your fighting\nskills, Messer David,\" said King Manfred. \"Now let us talk of the silk\ntrade. Join us, Lorenzo.\"\n\nManfred led the way into the audience chamber beyond the Hall of Mars.\nWalking beside Daoud, Celino snapped his fingers at Scipio. The big gray\nhound rose and followed, casting a hostile look at Daoud.\n\n_Why did they try to kill me?_\n\nIn the audience hall, marble pillars supported a vaulted ceiling pierced\nby circular glazed windows. A dozen or more men and women stood around,\nstaring at Daoud. His glance quickly took in the feathered caps of the\nmen, the pale rose and violet gowns of the women, and the gilded nets\nthat held their hair.\n\nHe tried not to stare at the women, whose faces were bare in the manner\nof unbelievers. But they were all, he noted, beautiful in varying\ndegrees. Several had striking blond hair and blue eyes. Though it was\nhis own coloring, he was not used to seeing fair women, and his\nheartbeat quickened.\n\nBut the gaze of a darker woman met his. Her amber-colored eyes seemed to\nburn. Her nose was small, the nostrils flaring, her lips full and dark\nred. The face was carefully without expression, revealing as little as\nif it were indeed covered with a veil.\n\nThe dark woman's black hair was coiled on top of her head in braids\nintertwined with ropes of pearls. Her scarlet gown was decorated with\nlong strips of satin embroidered in floral designs. Over her narrow\nshoulders she wore a shawl of flame-colored silk. Having been to\nConstantinople, Daoud recognized her style of dress as Byzantine. She\nmade the other women of Manfred's court look like barbarians.\n\nShe held his gaze steadily. He bowed his head courteously, and she\nresponded with a faint nod. Then he was past her.\n\nStanding on a dais at the end of the hall was a large chair of black\nwood with painted panels; to the left of the dais sat a small group of\npurple-robed men holding string and wind instruments. On the right was a\nsmall doorway. A servant leapt to fling open the door for Manfred, who\nstrode briskly toward it, tossing pleasantries to his courtiers.\n\nThe door led through a series of rooms where clerks wrote busily, and\nDaoud noticed with surprise that they went right on scribbling as their\nking walked through. Obviously Manfred preferred their work to their\nhomage.\n\nDaoud sensed that their path was taking them on a circuit of the great\neight-sided structure. They passed through a small kitchen where bakers\nwere preparing fruit pastries. Manfred plucked a freshly baked cherry\ntart from a tray, bit into it, and nodded to the bowing cook.\n\nTo his surprise, Daoud noticed a small figure in one corner, the little\nbent man who had earlier looked on him with pity. The dwarf lay curled\nup on his side with closed eyes on his empty firewood cart. Not a bad\noccupation, Daoud thought, supplying firewood to the king's pastry\nkitchen.\n\nBeyond the kitchen the three men entered another great hall, so brightly\nlit that Daoud's eyes hurt for a moment. The afternoon sun streamed\nthrough arched windows of white glass set, as in the Hall of Mars, high\nin the walls. The walls were lined with shelves loaded with books and\ncompartments filled with scrolls. Walkways at three levels ran around\nthe walls, and ladders were spaced along them. Men in long gray tunics\nbrowsed at the shelves or sat at tables in the center of the room\nreading books and scrolls and making notes on parchment.\n\nA servant opened a wrought-iron grill in the shortest wall of the\nlibrary, and the three men stepped out under the sky into an octagonal\nspace filled with trees and plants, enclosed on all sides by a\ncolonnaded gallery. In the center of the garden a small fountain played,\ntopped by a small bronze statue of a naked woman straddling a dolphin,\nthe water spurting from the dolphin's mouth. Daoud was momentarily\nshocked. The most powerful and corrupt emir in Egypt would not dare to\nhave such a statue where strangers might see it.\n\nManfred beckoned, and Daoud followed him down a pebble path to the basin\nof the fountain. Small dark green fish flickered through the water. The\nking seated himself on a marble bench, and the two men stood before him.\nAt a gesture from Lorenzo, Scipio lay down in the sun beside a bush\nbearing dozens of dark-red roses.\n\nThe sun gleamed on Manfred's pale hair. \"What does your sultan want of\nme?\" he asked.\n\n\"I am ordered to speak openly only to you and your secretary Aziz,\" said\nDaoud, his glance shifting to Lorenzo.\n\n\"Ah, you did not know, then, that Aziz is the name Lorenzo Celino uses\nwhen he writes to the Sultan of Cairo for me?\"\n\nLorenzo Celino--Aziz? Daoud turned to Celino and laughed with delighted\nsurprise.\n\n\"You write excellent Arabic. I would never have guessed that you were\nnot one of us.\"\n\nLorenzo accepted Daoud's compliment with a small bow.\n\n\"One of _us_?\" said Manfred. \"And what are you, then, Messere? I see\nbefore me a strapping man, blond enough to be one of my Swabian knights,\nyet who claims to come from the Sultan of Cairo. You are no Arab or\nTurk.\"\n\n\"Indeed not, Sire,\" said Daoud. \"I am a Mameluke.\"\n\n\"A blond Mameluke.\" Manfred nodded. \"Where are you from, then, Russia or\nCircassia?\"\n\nWithout emotion Daoud told the king of his descent from crusaders and\nhis capture by the Muslims.\n\n\"What a strange world this is,\" said Manfred. \"And when did this happen\nto you?\"\n\n\"Twenty years ago, Sire. For most of those years I have served my lord\nBaibars al-Bunduqdari, who is now Sultan of Cairo.\"\n\n\"And you are a Muslim?\"\n\n\"Of course, Sire.\"\n\nManfred stood up and came close to him. \"Of course? You say that so\nfirmly. Do you not remember the Christian teachings of your childhood?\"\n\nThe question made Daoud angry. _My soul is undivided. King or not, how\ndare this infidel question that!_\n\n\"God willed that I find the truth, Sire,\" he said simply.\n\nManfred shrugged. \"It is all the same to me. I have lived among Muslims\nall my life.\"\n\n\"May I know, Sire, why your secretary, to whom my master sent me in good\nfaith, tried to kill me?\" Daoud asked.\n\nManfred turned his back on Daoud and strolled a short distance down the\npebble path. \"Lorenzo is neither my secretary nor does he normally\ncommand my gate guards. He performs for me _unusual_ tasks that require\na man of uncommon courage, loyalty, and wit. Such as testing you--first,\nby taking you prisoner, then by giving you pork and wine and speaking to\nyou in Arabic, finally by trying to kill you.\"\n\n\"But I might have killed him.\"\n\n\"I did not realize how much of a risk I was taking,\" said Lorenzo.\n\n\"We did not think Baibars could find anywhere in his empire a man who\ncould go to the papal court undetected. We hoped to show him his error\nand send you back. But you are quite a remarkable man, David.\"\n\n_Show Baibars his error!_ Manfred might be a brilliant man, but he\nevidently underestimated Baibars. Daoud sensed himself feeling a bit\nsuperior and warned himself not to make the same mistake and\nunderestimate Manfred.\n\n\"Perhaps now that you have tested my ability, Sire, you might be more\ninclined to help me.\"\n\n\"Help you to do what?\" There was a note of irritation in Manfred's\nvoice. \"Your Sultan Baibars has asked me only to help you carry out a\nmission in the Papal States. What is your mission?\"\n\nDaoud said, \"Sire, my master chose not to entrust his plan to writing,\nbut sent me to tell it to you instead. I am here for one purpose, to\nprevent the forming of an alliance between Christians and Tartars.\"\n\nManfred looked surprised, and stared intently at Daoud. \"Tartars? Those\nbarbarians who invaded Europe--how long ago, Lorenzo?\"\n\nLorenzo frowned. \"Over twenty years, Sire.\"\n\nDaoud said, \"Fifty years ago they were nothing. A scattering of\nherdsmen, like the Bedouin. Now they are the most powerful people on\nearth.\"\n\nManfred nodded. \"Yes, I remember now. When they rode into Poland and\nHungary I was just a boy. Everyone was in terror of them. Their emperor\nsent letters to all the monarchs of Europe demanding that they\nsurrender. He contemptuously offered them positions in his court.\" He\ngrinned at Daoud. \"My father showed me the letter he was sending back.\nIf Tartar emperor succeeded in conquering Europe, my father said, he\nwould be well qualified to serve as his falconer.\"\n\nDaoud inclined his head. \"Your family's love of falconry is well known\nto your admirers in the lands of Islam. My lord the sultan considers you\nan old friend and hopes that you will see fit to help him in his time of\nneed.\"\n\nManfred held out his hands, palms up. \"If I can.\"\n\n\"Now the Tartars have fallen upon the lands of Islam,\" Daoud said. \"They\nhave conquered Persia. They have a hundred thousand mounted warriors in\nthe field, and allies and auxiliaries. They have leveled our holy city\nof Baghdad, destroyed it utterly, and killed every man, woman, and child\nwho lived there, even the Commander of the Faithful, our caliph himself.\nThese are no fanciful tales, Sire. I have fought against the Tartars. I\nhave seen with my own eyes the ashes of Baghdad and the heaps of its\ndead.\"\n\nThe scene of desolation arose in his mind as it had so many times\nbefore, the gray plain where a city had been, the unbelievable sight of\na landscape strewn with rotting, headless corpses as far as the eye\ncould see. To put it out of his mind, he hurried on with what he had to\nsay.\n\n\"Now their armies advance through Syria, threatening the realm of my\nlord, the Sultan of Cairo. We have had word that Hulagu Khan, commander\nof the Tartar armies in Persia, has sent two high-ranking emissaries to\nthe pope. They are sailing across the Middle Sea now, from the island of\nCyprus to Venice. Hulagu Khan wants to form an alliance with the\nChristian rulers of Europe to attack us from both directions at once,\neast and west. Our whole people, our whole Muslim faith, could be\nutterly wiped out.\"\n\nManfred nodded grimly. \"And all of Christian Europe would rejoice at\nyour destruction. Not I, certainly, but the rest of them. What do you\npropose to do about these Tartar emissaries to the pope?\"\n\n\"For that I will need your help, Sire. I, too, will go to the pope's\ncourt. I understand that he resides at Orvieto, a small town north of\nRome.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Lorenzo put in, \"and there he will stay. He has not set foot in\nRome since he galloped in to be crowned at Saint Peter's and galloped\nout again. He is terrified of the Roman mob. As well he should be, since\nmost of their leaders are in our pay.\"\n\n\"Trade secrets, Celino,\" said Manfred, raising a cautioning finger. \"So,\nyou will go to Orvieto. And then?\"\n\n\"I will present myself at the pope's court as I have here, as David, a\nmerchant of Trebizond. I will take up residence with--friends--who can\nhelp me reach the ears of men of influence. I will spread stories\nthroughout Orvieto--true stories--of the horrors the Tartars have\nperpetrated everywhere they have gone, of their determination to conquer\nthe entire world.\"\n\nManfred shook his head. \"What you plan to do is very dangerous. You've\nproven to us that you are a skilled and resourceful man, but still, what\nif you are discovered?\" He shook his head. \"Have you any idea of how\nyour people are _hated_ in Europe, David? If it were known that I helped\na Muslim spy to steal into the court of the pope, all the kingdoms of\nChristendom would turn against me. The pope need but snap his fingers\nand I and my little realm would be swept away. No, David. You ask me to\nrisk too much.\"\n\nDaoud was momentarily surprised, then angry. He had expected that\nManfred would cooperate with him. If the young king vacillated, Daoud\nmight have journeyed from Egypt to Italy for nothing.\n\nAnd then a ripple of fear crept up his spine. If he failed to persuade\nManfred, the Tartars might destroy the world he had come to love and\nbelieve in.\n\n_God, help me to stop them. I must not go back to El Kahira a failure._\n\nHe must choose his words with care. He was dealing here with a king, and\none did not argue with kings. Better to ask questions than offer\narguments.\n\n\"Does not the pope wish even now to take your throne from you, Sire?\" he\nsaid. \"How can matters between you and him be any worse?\"\n\nManfred nodded. \"True, Pope Urban keeps offering my crown to this prince\nand that, claiming that I had no right to inherit it from my father. And\nthat he had no right to have it in the first place.\" Manfred bit his\nlip, and the light pink of his cheeks reddened. \"But only the French are\npowerful enough to take it from me. And King Louis of France is kindly\ndisposed to me and will not permit any of his great barons to make war\non me. I rely on Louis's continued goodwill.\"\n\n\"But the man who wants to join with the Tartars to annihilate Islam is\nthat same King Louis of France,\" Daoud said. \"France, as you said, is\nthe only kingdom with the power to help the pope dethrone you. Should\nthe pope decide against allying with the Tartars, King Louis will\ncontinue to prohibit his subjects from joining the pope's war against\nyou. Help me, and you come between King Louis and the pope.\"\n\n\"Intrigue requires gold,\" said Manfred. \"Does your master expect me to\npay for your activities?\"\n\n\"What I have brought with me will pay for all,\" Daoud replied. He\nunbuckled his belt and undid the laces that held his hose tight around\nhis waist. Celino moved closer, tense, ready in case Daoud should reach\nfor a weapon. Daoud slipped his fingers into the breeches he wore under\nhis hose and found the bag tied to the drawstring.\n\n\"What is the man doing?\" said Manfred with a wondering smile. Celino\nshook his head.\n\nDaoud pulled out a bag of heavy red silk, full and round with what it\nheld. He felt a childlike delight in mystifying the two men.\n\n\"Pay me from your royal treasury what this is worth,\" said Daoud, \"and I\nshall have gold enough for all I need to do.\" He pulled apart the mouth\nof the silk bag and drew out of it a globe of green fire. He held it out\nto Manfred. Celino gasped.\n\nDaoud was gratified at their wonderment.\n\n\"Are you not afraid I will steal this from you and dump you in an\nunmarked grave?\" said Manfred with a bright grin.\n\n\"The Hohenstaufen family have been friends of the sultans of Egypt since\nyour father's day,\" said Daoud. \"We have learned to trust you.\"\n\n\"Just listen to that, Lorenzo,\" said Manfred. \"The Saracens think better\nof me than the pope does.\"\n\nBesides, Daoud thought, Manfred knew that Baibars's arm was long.\nManfred, Daoud was sure, knew that Baibars would not permit anyone, even\na distant head of state, to betray him so flagrantly.\n\nHis eyes wide, Manfred extended his palm, and Daoud unhesitatingly\nplaced the emerald in it. Manfred raised it close to his face, peering\nthrough the dark depths into its glowing heart. The jewel, irregular in\nshape but nearly spherical, reflected little spots of pale green light\non his cheeks. He shook his head.\n\n\"Green, the color I love best in all the world. The color of hope.\" He\nencircled it with thumb and forefinger. \"Look, Lorenzo, I cannot get my\nfingers around it. I am amazed that your master is willing to part with\nsuch a wonder. How did he come by it?\"\n\n\"It has been through many hands, Sire,\" said Daoud. \"It once belonged to\nEmir Fakr ad-Din, who commanded the army of Egypt when King Louis\ninvaded our land.\"\n\n\"To think Baibars let you take this emerald from him, and you came all\nthis way from Alexandria with it and delivered it to me. And Baibars\ntrusted you.\"\n\n\"As he trusts you, Sire,\" Daoud put in quickly.\n\n\"_You_ are like a falcon, are you not?\" said Manfred, smiling into\nDaoud's eyes. \"Released to fly far afield for your sultan.\"\n\nManfred strode to Daoud suddenly and clapped him on the shoulder. \"Let\nit be done as your master wishes, then. The trader from Trebizond will\ngo to Orvieto with my help.\"\n\nA surge of joy sprang up within Daoud and almost burst past his lips. He\nbowed, his heart pounding.\n\n_God be thanked!_\n\nManfred said, \"We must see about turning this jewel of yours into gold\ncoins. Or smaller jewels. They would be easier to carry than gold.\"\nManfred looked lovingly at the emerald again, then carefully dropped it\ninto his belt pouch and smiled at Daoud.\n\n\"You should not go alone into the Papal States, David. You may have\nstudied Europe from afar, but you do not know Italy firsthand. Lorenzo\nhere shall go with you. I trust Lorenzo to travel far and secretly in my\nservice, even as your master trusts you.\"\n\nCelino sighed. Daoud and Celino eyed each other.\n\nDaoud began searching for ways to dissuade Manfred. A short while\nearlier he and Celino had been trying to kill each other. And Celino\nwould be putting Manfred's interests first, not those of Islam.\n\nObviously aware of his hesitation, Manfred took his arm. \"Listen to me,\nMameluke. You will be wise to accept every bit of help that is offered\nto you. I have powerful allies in northern Italy, in Florence, Pisa,\nSiena, and other cities. But you do not know them and they do not know\nyou. Lorenzo speaks for me. He knows who the key Ghibellini are in the\nnorth, and they know him. Do not object to taking him with you.\"\n\nManfred would not let him go, Daoud realized, unless Celino went with\nhim. And the argument that Celino could put him in touch with the\nGhibellini of the north was a strong one.\n\n_Lorenzo is perhaps twenty years older than I, but he is quick-witted\nand quick on his feet. And, yes, I would rather not go alone. I could\neasily make a mistake from ignorance. I am better off with a man like\nthis to guide me._\n\nA tentative smile played under Celino's grizzled mustache. \"My royal\nmaster is determined in this. What do you say?\"\n\nDaoud bowed. \"I accept. With gratitude. We shall travel this road\ntogether.\"\n\n\"Whatever happens to the two of you,\" Manfred said, \"no one must ever\nknow that I am involved.\"\n\n\"I guarantee that, Sire,\" said Celino.\n\nManfred rubbed the palms of his hands together. \"There is one other\nperson I propose to send with you. She can be a great help to you.\"\n\nCelino turned quickly to Manfred. \"I do not advise it, Sire.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" said Manfred. \"She will be perfect.\"\n\n\"Because she will not want to go.\" There was censure in Celino's dark\nstare--and a boyish defiance in Manfred's answering look.\n\n\"Do not question me,\" said Manfred. \"I have no choice. For her good and\nfor my own, she must leave here. And she _will_ be useful to you.\"\n\nInstead of replying, Celino only sighed again.\n\n\"A woman?\" Daoud was thunderstruck. In El Kahira women left their homes\nonly to visit other women. He felt anxiety claw at his belly. Any\nmistake in planning might wreck the mission and doom him, and Celino, to\na horrible death. And to send a woman to the court of the pope on such a\nventure seemed not just a mistake, but utter madness.\n\n\"A very beautiful woman,\" said Manfred, a grin stretching his blond\nmustache. \"One who has had a lifetime's schooling in intrigue. She is\nfrom Constantinople, and her name is Sophia, which means wisdom in\nGreek.\"\n\n_There are no more treacherous people on this earth than the\nByzantines_, Daoud thought, _and they have ever been enemies of Islam_.\n\nArgument surged up in him, but he saw a hardness in Manfred's eyes that\ntold him nothing he might say would sway the king. He looked at Celino,\nand saw in the dark, mustached face the same reluctant acceptance he had\nheard in the sigh.\n\nWhoever this Sophia might be, he would have to take her with him.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nSophia pressed her head back against the pillow and screamed with\npleasure. Her loins dissolved into rippling liquid gold. Her fingers dug\ninto the man's back and her legs clenched around his hips, trying to\ncrush him against her.\n\n\"Oh--oh--oh--\" she moaned. The warmth spread to her toes, her\nfingertips, her scalp, filling her with joy. She was so happy that she\nwanted to cry.\n\nAs the blaze of ekstasia died down, she felt Manfred driving deep inside\nher. She felt his hardness, his separateness, as she could not feel it a\nmoment ago when she was at her peak and they seemed to melt together,\none being.\n\nHis rhythm was insistent, inexorable, like a heartbeat. His hands under\nher back were tense. He was fighting for his climax.\n\nShe delighted in the sight of his massive shoulders overshadowing her.\nIt was almost like being loved by a god.\n\nManfred's face was pressed against her shoulder, his open mouth on her\ncollarbone. She turned toward him and saw the light in his white-gold\nhair. She slid one hand up to his hair and stroked it, while with the\nother she rubbed his back in a circular motion.\n\nShe felt the muscles in his body tighten against her. He drew in a\nshuddering breath.\n\n\"Yes--yes--good,\" she whispered, still stroking his hair, still\ncaressing his back.\n\nHe relaxed, panting heavily.\n\n_He never makes much noise. Nothing like my outcries._\n\nThey lay without moving, she pleased by the warm weight of him lying\nupon her, as if it protected her from floating away. The feel of him\nstill inside her sent wavelets of pleasure through her.\n\nStill adrift on sensations of delight, she opened her eyes to stare up\ninto the shadows of the canopy overhead. On the heavy bed curtains to\nher left, the late afternoon sun cast an oblong of yellow light with a\npointed arch at the top, the shape of an open window nearby. She knew\nwell the play of light in this unoccupied bedchamber in an upper part of\nthe castle. Manfred and she had met here many times.\n\nThey rolled together so that they lay side by side in a nest of red and\npurple cushions. The down-filled silk bolster under them whispered as\nthey shifted their weight, and the rope netting that held it creaked.\nManfred propped his head up with one arm. His free hand toyed with the\nringlets of her unbound hair. She slid her palm over his chest.\n\nShe remembered an ancient sculpture she had seen in a home outside\nAthens. The torso of a man, head missing, arms broken off at the\nshoulders, legs gone below the knees, the magnificent body had survived\nbarbarian invasions, the coming of Christianity, the iconoclasts, the\nFrankish conquest, to stand now on a plain pedestal in a room with\npurple walls, the yellowish marble gleaming in the light of many\ncandles. Her host showed it only to his most trusted guests.\n\n\"Which god is this?\" she had asked.\n\n\"I think it is just an athlete,\" said her host. \"The old Greeks made\ngods of their athletes.\"\n\nManfred's naked torso, pale as marble, seemed as beautiful. And was\nalive.\n\nShe sighed happily. \"How lucky I am that there was time for love in my\nking's life this afternoon.\" She spoke in the Sicilian dialect,\nManfred's favorite of all his languages.\n\nHow lucky, she thought, that after all her years of wandering she had at\nlast found a place in the world where she was loved and needed.\n\nHis lips stretched in a smile, but his blue eyes were empty. Uneasiness\ntook hold of her. She sensed from the look on his face that he was about\nto tell her something she did not want to hear.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn memory she heard a voice say, _Italy was ours not so long ago and\nmight be ours again_. So Michael Paleologos, the Basileus, Emperor of\nConstantinople, had introduced the suggestion that she go to Italy, and\nat just such a moment as this, when they were in bed together in his\nhunting lodge outside Nicaea.\n\nShe had felt no distress at the idea of being parted from Michael. He\nwas a scrawny man with a long gray beard, and though she counted herself\nenormously lucky to have attracted his attention, she felt no love for\nhim.\n\nShe had come to Lucera acting as Michael's agent and personal emissary\nto Manfred--and resenting Michael's use of her but feeling she had no\nchoice. She was a present from one monarch to another. She ought to be\nflattered, she supposed.\n\nShe had walked into Manfred's court in the embroidered jeweled mantle\nMichael had given her, her hair bound up in silver netting. Lorenzo\nCelino had conducted her to the throne, and she bowed and looked up. And\nit was like gazing upon the sun.\n\nManfred von Hohenstaufen's smile was brilliant, his hair white-gold, his\neyes sapphires.\n\nHe stepped down from his throne, took her hand, and led her to his\neight-sided garden. First she gave him Michael's messages--news that a\nTartar army had stormed the crusader city of Sidon, leveled it, and\nridden off again--a warning that Pope Urban had secretly offered the\ncrown of Naples and Sicily, Manfred's crown, to Prince Edward, heir\napparent to the throne of England.\n\n\"Your royal master is kind, but the pope's secret is no secret,\" Manfred\nhad said, laughing and unconcerned. \"The nobility of England have flatly\ntold Prince Edward that they will supply neither money nor men for an\nadventure in Italy. The pope must find another robber baron to steal my\ncrown.\" And then he asked her about herself, and they talked about her\nand about him.\n\nShe had thought all westerners were savages, but Manfred amazed her with\nhis cultivation. He knew more than many Byzantines, for whom\nConstantinople--which they always called \"the Polis,\" the City, as if it\nwere the only one--was the whole world. In the short time she and\nManfred strolled together that day, he spoke to her in Greek, Latin, and\nItalian, and she later found out that he knew French, German, and Arabic\nas well.\n\nHe sang a song to her in a tongue she did not recognize, and he told her\nit was Proven\u00e7al, the language of the troubadours.\n\nHe undid the clasp of her mantle and let it fall to the gravel. He\nkissed her in the bright sunlight, and she forgot Michael Paleologos.\nShe belonged altogether to Manfred von Hohenstaufen.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNow, with a chill, she remembered that she did indeed _belong_ to\nManfred. She was not his mate but his servant.\n\nHis fingertips stroked her nipple lightly, but she ignored the tingle of\npleasure. She waited for him to say what he had to say.\n\nHe said, \"Remember the fair-haired Muslim who came to the court today?\"\n\n\"The man from Egypt? You had him killed?\"\n\n\"I changed my mind,\" Manfred said.\n\nShe felt relief. She was surprised at herself. She had wanted the man to\nlive. She remembered her astonishment when, with a gesture like a\nperforming magician's, Manfred threw open the doors of his audience hall\nand the entire court saw the blond man with his dagger at Celino's\nthroat.\n\nShe had been surprised when Manfred told her that this man, dressed in a\ndrab tunic and hose like a less-than-prosperous Italian merchant, was\nthe awaited Saracen from the Sultan of Egypt.\n\nThe sight of him as he passed through the audience hall had left her\nmomentarily breathless. He looked like one of those blond men of western\nEurope the people of Constantinople called Franks and had learned to\nhate at sight. His hair was not as light as Manfred's; it was darker,\nmore the color of brass than of gold. Manfred's lips were full and red,\nbut this man's mouth was a down-curving line, the mouth of a man who had\nendured cruelty without complaint and could himself be cruel. She\nwondered what he had seen and done.\n\nAs he had passed her, his eyes caught hers. Strange eyes, she could not\ntell what color they were. There was a fixity in them akin to madness.\nThe face was expressionless, rocklike. This, she was sure, was no\nordinary man, to be disposed of as an inconvenience. She was not\nsurprised Manfred had decided to let him live.\n\n\"Why did you change your mind?\"\n\n\"I think this Mameluke can help me,\" Manfred said. \"Therefore I am going\nto help him. He is going to Orvieto on a mission for his sultan. I am\nsending Lorenzo with him.\"\n\n\"What did you call him?\"\n\n\"A Mameluke. A slave warrior. The Turks who rule in Muslim lands take\nvery young boys as slaves and raise them in barracks to be soldiers.\nThey forget their parents and are trained with the utmost rigor. They\nare said to be the finest warriors in the world.\"\n\n_What does a life like that do to a man? It must either destroy him or\nmake him invincible._\n\n\"The man looks like a Frank,\" she said.\n\n\"He comes of English stock,\" said Manfred. \"You Byzantines lump all of\nus together, English and French and Germans, as Franks, do you not? So\nyou can call him a Frank if you like. But whatever he looks like, he is\na Turk at heart. I've learned that from talking to him. It's really\nquite amazing.\"\n\nThey were plunged into deep shadow as the arched golden shape on the bed\ncurtain disappeared, a cloud having passed over the sun. Despite the\nsummer's heat she felt cold, and even though she did not trust Manfred\nshe reached for him, wanting him close.\n\nBut Manfred drew away from her, preoccupied. She pulled a crimson\ncushion from behind him and hugged it against her breasts.\n\n_How alone the Mameluke must feel. Even here, where Muslims are\ntolerated, they have tried to kill him. And when he is in the pope's\nterritory, every man will be his enemy._\n\nShe remembered the harsh face with its prominent cheekbones and gray\neyes and thought, Perhaps being alone holds no terror for him.\n\n_After all, I am alone, and I have made the best of it._\n\n\"What is his mission in Orvieto?\" she asked.\n\nShe listened intently as Manfred told her a tale of trying to prevent\nthe great powers of East and West from joining together to crush Islam\nbetween them.\n\nManfred continued, \"David hopes to influence the pope's counselors to\nturn against the Tartars, that they may sway the pope himself.\"\n\n\"How can one man attempt such a huge undertaking?\"\n\n\"He brought me an exceedingly valuable stone, an emerald, which I will\ntrade for jewels he can carry to Orvieto and exchange for coins. It\npleases me greatly that the sultan would entrust me with such a gem.\nThat helped to change my mind about this David. The Saracens are men of\nhonor in their way.\" He smiled at her, looking pleased with the\nsituation and pleased with himself. But she was quiet, unmoving, waiting\nfor him to say the thing she feared to hear.\n\n\"But you are right,\" Manfred went on. \"He cannot do it alone.\"\n\nWarm yellow light once more filled their curtained cubicle. The cloud\nhad passed away from the sun. But her heart froze.\n\n\"I have decided I must entrust my own most precious jewel to David.\" He\nput his hand on hers.\n\n_Oh, no!_ she thought, anguish tearing at her heart as his words\nconfirmed her guess. She felt a terrible pain, as if he had run her\nthrough with a spear. She wanted to clutch at him, hold him in spite of\nhimself. She had not felt so lost since her mother and father and the\nboy she loved were killed by the Franks.\n\nShe studied his face to memorize it, because soon she would leave him\nand probably never see him again. It would do her no good to let him see\nhow she felt. She must decide what face to show him.\n\n_I am a woman of Constantinople, alone in a country of strangers. And we\nare an ancient people, wise and subtle, and we bide our time._\n\nShe sat up in the bed, hugging her knees, thinking.\n\n\"How will my going with him help you?\"\n\nHe grunted softly, and she looked at him. He appeared relieved. She was\nmaking it easy for him. She felt the beginning of dislike for him\nstirring within her.\n\n\"I thought you would be perfect for this. And you are.\"\n\nHis words puzzled her, and she almost let her growing anger show. \"I do\nnot see what you see, Sire.\"\n\n\"We are in bed. You may call me Manfred.\"\n\n_But I do not want to call you Manfred._\n\n\"What is it you think I would be so good at?\"\n\n\"You can mask your feelings,\" he said with a smile. \"You are doing it\nnow. You are very good at it.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Sire.\"\n\nHe shook his head, sat up beside her, and put an arm around her\nshoulders. \"I meant it when I said you are precious to me. But you must\ngo with this man. I cannot tell you all my reasons, but it is for your\nown safety as well.\"\n\nNo doubt he was being honest with her, though he was not telling her\neverything. Just the other day one of Manfred's servants, whom she had\ncultivated with gifts, warned her that Manfred's queen, Helene of\nCyprus, was demanding that Manfred break with Sophia. Of course, Manfred\nwould never be willing to admit that his wife could force him to do such\na thing.\n\nShe wanted to get off by herself and think this out, and cry, let tears\nrelease some of the pain she felt. This curtained bed confined her like\na dungeon cell. She found her white shift amid the rumpled bedclothes.\nGetting up on her knees, she raised the shift over her head and\nstruggled into it.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" Manfred asked.\n\nShe crawled around the bed to look for her gown and her belt. \"I have\narrangements to make. Packing to do.\"\n\n\"I have not dismissed you,\" he said a bit sullenly.\n\n\"Yes, you have,\" she said, deliberately making her voice so low that it\nwould be hard for him to hear.\n\n\"You have not heard everything.\" He took her arm. She wanted to pull\naway, but she let him hold her.\n\n\"I need your help,\" he went on. \"You see, if David fails, in a year or\ntwo I may be dead.\"\n\nHe let go of her. She picked up the blue gown she had so eagerly thrown\noff an hour ago. Her fingers crushed the silk. She wanted to be alone,\nbut she needed to learn more. She paused, kneeling beside him.\n\n\"God forbid, Sire! Why should you be dead?\"\n\n\"This time the pope is offering my crown to the French.\"\n\nSitting down, laying the gown in her lap, she sighed and turned all her\nattention to him.\n\n\"Why can you not make peace with the pope? Why is he so determined to\ndethrone you?\"\n\n\"Like all storied feuds, it goes back so far that no one can remember\nwhat started it,\" said Manfred, smiling with his lips but not his eyes.\n\"At present the pope refuses to recognize me because my father promised\nto give up the crown of Sicily.\"\n\nHe paused a moment, and fixed her with a strangely intent stare. \"And\nbecause my father did not marry my mother. Even though he loved her\nonly, and never loved any of his three empresses.\"\n\n_He is trying to tell me something_, Sophia thought.\n\nBut before she could reply, he went on with his tale of the\nHohenstaufens and the popes. \"As the popes see it, to have a\nHohenstaufen ruling southern Italy and Sicily is like having a knife at\ntheir throats. This pope, Urban, is a Frenchman, and he is trying to get\nthe French to help him drive us out.\"\n\nThe French. It was the French who, over fifty years ago, had stormed\nConstantinople, looted it, and ruled over it until driven out by Michael\nPaleologos.\n\nAnd now the French threatened Manfred.\n\nFrom his island of Sicily, how easy to launch another invasion of\nConstantinople.\n\nIn memory she saw Alexis, the boy she loved, fall as the French crossbow\nbolt hit him. She heard him cry out to her.\n\n_Go, Sophia, go!_\n\n_Why was I saved that night if not that I might help to stop the French\nfrom conquering Constantinople again?_\n\n\"I cannot send an army to Orvieto to stop the pope's intrigues against\nme,\" Manfred said. \"That would turn all Christendom against me. But I\ncan send my two best people, my brave and clever Lorenzo and my\nbeautiful and clever Sophia. Together with David, you two perhaps can\nturn my enemies against each other. You may be gone six months or a\nyear. And afterward you can come back.\"\n\nHe did not take his eyes from hers as he said it, but there was a\nflickering in their depths that told her he was not being honest with\nher.\n\n\"When will I meet this--Mameluke?\"\n\n\"Tomorrow we go falconing. The forest is a good place to talk freely.\"\nHe paused and grinned at her. \"But do not dress just yet. This may be my\nlast chance to enjoy your lovely body.\"\n\nShe looked away. She felt no desire for him. She was sick of being\nenjoyed.\n\n\"Forgive me, Sire, I have much to do,\" she said. Before he could object,\nshe had slipped through the curtains around the bed and was pulling her\nblue gown over her head. She had left half her clothes behind with\nManfred, but that did not matter. Her own quarters were near, and later\nshe could send a servant for her things.\n\nAs she hurried out the door, she pretended not to hear Manfred's angry\ncry, muffled by the bed's thick curtains.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSophia wrapped in white linen the satin mantle in which she had been\npresented at Manfred's court. She laid it in her traveling chest, then\nbrought her jewel box from the table on which it had stood since she'd\narrived here, and laid it on the mantle.\n\nManfred would gladly have ordered servants to do this packing for her,\nbut it was easier to preserve her privacy when she did for herself.\n\nShe looked down at the polished ebony box with the double-headed eagle\nof Constantinople in mother-of-pearl inlay. A gift from the Basileus\nwhen he sent her to Sicily. The eagle of Constantinople, tradition said,\nwas the inspiration for the two-headed Hohenstaufen eagle.\n\nShe folded a green woolen tunic and laid it over the jewel box. As she\nstood with her hands pressed on the tunic, sorrow welled up within her.\n\n_Was there ever a woman more alone in the world than I am?_\n\nIn one night made hideous by the flames of the burning city and the\nscreams of the dying, she had lost her father, Demetrios Karaiannides,\nthe silversmith, and her mother, Danuta, and her two sisters, Euphemia\nand Eirene. The people of the Polis had risen against the Franks, and\nthe Franks had retaliated by killing everyone they could lay hands upon.\n\nThe boy she was going to marry, the boy she loved, had fled with her to\nthe Marmara waterfront. There they found a small boat, and then the\ncrossbow bolt had torn through his back. Dying, he cast her adrift.\n\n_Go, Sophia, go!_\n\nFrom then on she was alone.\n\n_What am I? What is a woman alone?_\n\nNot a queen or an empress, not a wife or a mother, not a daughter, not a\nnun. Not mistress, now that Michael and Manfred had each sent her away.\nNot courtesan or even harlot.\n\nCrossing the Bosporus to Asia Minor, she had survived. She did not care\nto remember the means by which she survived. Of all of them, the least\ndishonorable was theft.\n\nShe let herself be used, and she could be very useful. She found her way\nto the Byzantine general Michael Paleologos, who wanted to take\nConstantinople back from the Franks.\n\nHer help had been important to Michael, and he had rewarded her after he\nreconquered the Polis and made himself its Basileus by keeping her as\nhis favorite for a time. And she had rejoiced to see Constantinople\nliberated from the barbarians, even though no one she loved was left\nalive in it.\n\nThen Michael had made her leave the one place she loved, sending her to\nManfred in Italy.\n\nAnd now, just when she had begun to lose the feeling of not belonging\nanywhere, just when she felt she had found safe harbor with Manfred, she\nwas cut loose again.\n\nShe felt the tears coming, and fought them. She turned her mind away\nfrom the questions that plagued her and thought about her packing.\n\n_Saint Simon should go into the chest next._\n\nIn the center, where clothing above and below would protect him.\n\nShe went to the table by the window, where the small icon stood between\ntwo candles in tall brass candlesticks. She picked up the saint and\nreverently kissed his forehead, then held the icon out at arm's length\nto look at it. The eyes dominated the portrait, transfixing her with a\nblue stare.\n\nShe had painted it herself a few years before, copying another, larger\nicon that belonged to the Basileus Michael. Simon's cheeks were hollow,\nhis mouth a tight line, his chin sharp. His hair hung brown and lank to\nhis shoulders, framing his face.\n\nShe had used real gold dust in the paint for the halo. Michael was\ngenerous to her, and he laughed when she told him that she spent some of\nthe money he gave her on expensive paint for an icon. The idea of a\nwoman who painted amused him, like the bear that danced in the\nHippodrome.\n\nBeyond the gold of the halo was the ocher of the desert and, standing\nlonely over the saint's right shoulder, the pillar on which he had lived\nin penance for fifteen years, the pillar that had given him his\nname--Simon Stylites.\n\n_Why do I reverence this saint? Because he knew how to endure alone, and\nthat is what is most important._\n\n_Rest well, dear saint_, she prayed as she lowered the icon into the\ncedar chest. She closed the gilded wooden doors that protected the\npainting, breaking the grip of Simon's staring blue eyes.\n\nShe next opened a small box of dark, polished wood, its lid inlaid with\nbits of mother-of-pearl forming a bird with swirling wings. A dozen\nsmall porcelain jars lay in velvet-lined recesses shaped to hold them.\nEach jar was ornamented with the same floral pattern in a different\ncolor, each color that of the powdered pigment the tightly corked jar\ncontained. Take a pinch of the powder, add water and the clear liquid\nfrom a raw egg, and you had a jewel-bright paint. Wrapped in linen at\none end of the box were her quill pens, brushes, and charcoal sticks.\n\nAs always, the sight of her materials made her want to stop what she was\ndoing and paint. She closed the lid gently, stroking its cover,\nremembering the merchant from Soldaia in the Crimea who had sold her the\nbox outside the Church of Saint John in Stoudion, telling her it came\nfrom a land far to the east called Cathay.\n\n_The Cathayans must be as civilized as we are to make such a thing_, she\nthought as she put the box in her chest.\n\nThis blond Saracen--this Mameluke--whom she had seen briefly and would\nmeet again tomorrow, would not be a civilized man. He was both Turk and\nFrank--barbarity coupled with barbarity.\n\n\"Kriste eleison!\" she whispered. \"Christ have mercy.\" Until this moment\nshe had been able to stave off her fear of the danger she was going\ninto. Now it struck her full force, leaving her paralyzed over her\ntraveling chest, her trembling hand still resting on her box of paints\nas if it were a talisman that could protect her.\n\nShe was going among the worst enemies her people had on earth, more to\nbe feared than the Saracens--the Latin Christians of the West. The floor\nseemed to shake under her, and her body went cold and then hot as she\nthought of what she must face. If they found out that she was a woman of\nConstantinople, they would tear the flesh from her bones.\n\n_A woman of Constantinople helping a Saracen to plot against the pope!_\n\nFear was like a cold, black ocean, and she was drowning in it. She dared\nnot even let herself imagine the horrors, the torments that would end\nher life if those people in Orvieto found her out.\n\nShe did not have to go through with it. Once she and Lorenzo and this\nDavid--this Mameluke--were on the road, she could slip away. Manfred had\nsaid they would be carrying jewels. Perhaps she could take some, use\nthem to buy passage for herself.\n\n_Passage to where?_\n\nThere was no place in the world she belonged but Constantinople. And her\nplace in the Polis was dependent on the basileus, Michael. If she\nangered Manfred, she could not dare go back to Michael.\n\nTo be forever exiled from Constantinople would be a living death.\n\nIn her mind she saw the Polis, glowing golden at the edge of the sea.\nShe saw the great gray walls that had protected Constantinople against\nbarbarian invaders from East and West for a thousand years. She saw the\ngorgeous pink marble of the Blachernae Palace of the Basileus, the\nstatue of Justinian astride his horse, his hand raised toward the East,\nthe great dome of Hagia Sophia, her namesake saint, that seemed to float\nover the city, held in place by an army of angels. She heard the roar of\nthe crowd watching chariots race in the Hippodrome and the cries of the\nmerchants from their shops along the arcaded Mese. The Polis was the hub\nof the world, the fulfillment of all desires.\n\nThe vision sent strength and purpose surging through her body, and she\nstraightened up, took her hand from the paint box, and began moving\naround the room again, collecting her possessions.\n\nShe would go with Lorenzo and the Mameluke and do, as she had always\ndone, whatever was necessary. She would see this thing through. With the\nhelp of God, she might prevail.\n\n_And after that?_\n\nWhat future for a woman as alone as Sophia Karaiannides?\n\nShe shrugged. Time enough to think about the future after she had been\nto Orvieto and lived through it.\n\nOf one thing she was already sure. She would not come back to Manfred.\n\nShe went back to her table. From a reading stand at its side she picked\nup her leather-bound book of parchment sheets and opened it to a page\nmarked by a ribbon. She studied the portrait of Manfred she had begun\nonly two days before. Most of it was still rough charcoal strokes, but\nshe had colored his beard in a mixture of yellow and white paints,\nbecause it was the most important color and she wanted to get it down\nfirst so it could control her choice of the other colors. The eyes would\nbe last, because when she painted in the eyes the picture would, in a\nsense, come to life.\n\nEven with the eyes blank the portrait seemed to smile at her, and she\nfelt a ripple of remembered pleasure. Grief followed almost at once.\n\n_Shall I try to finish this tonight and give it to him as a parting\ngift?_\n\nAfter a moment's thought her fingers clawed at the parchment and tore it\nfree of the stitches that held it in the book. She rolled it up and held\nan end to a candle flame.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nKeeping his face severe, Simon de Gobignon walked slowly past the six\nknights lined up on the wharf. The men's faces were scarlet and\nglistening with sweat under their conical steel helmets. Simon felt\nrivulets running down his own back, under his padded cotton undershirt,\nmail hauberk, and surcoat.\n\nGulls screamed overhead, and the smell of the salt sea and of rotting\nfish hung heavy in the warm air.\n\nVenice in July, Simon thought, was no place to be dressed in full battle\ngear.\n\nThe two banners held by men-at-arms at the end of the line hung limply:\nthe royal standard of France, gold fleurs-de-lis on an azure ground, and\nthat of Gobignon, gold crowns on purple.\n\nSimon reproached himself. He had brought his company down to the\nwaterfront too early, as soon as he had word that the galley bearing the\nTartar ambassadors from Cyprus was in the harbor. It was there, sure\nenough; he could see it, a long, dark shape a few hundred feet from\nshore. But it rode at anchor while officials of the Most Serene Republic\ninspected it for diseases and registered its cargo, a task that had\nalready taken hours while Simon and his men sweltered onshore.\n\nBehind the knights stood a lance of archers, forty men in four rows.\nThey were talking and laughing among themselves in the Venetian dialect,\nwhich Simon could barely understand. While growing up he had learned the\nspeech of Sicily, but that was nearly a different language.\n\nThe crossbowmen should not be chattering, Simon thought. It was\nunmilitary. Besides, it irritated him and added to the tension of this\nendless waiting.\n\nHe took a step back and shouted, \"Silencio!\" The archers looked up, and\nhe saw more surprise and annoyance than respect in their faces. Some\neyed him expectantly, as if they thought him about to make a speech. He\nglared at the archers for what he felt was a suitable interval, then\nturned away and walked out to the edge of the jetty, his thumbs hooked\nin his sword belt. He ignored the muttering that arose the moment he\nturned his back.\n\n\"Scusi, Your Signory,\" said a rasping voice at his elbow. Simon turned.\n\nAndrea Sordello, capitano of the archers, smiled broadly at him,\nrevealing a gap where one of his eye teeth should have been. The bridge\nof his nose was smashed flat.\n\n\"What is it, Sordello?\" The capitano had met him in Venice with a letter\nof recommendation from Count Charles d'Anjou, brother of King Louis of\nFrance, but a not-quite-hidden insolence in the manner of this bravo\nmade Simon uneasy.\n\n\"If Your Signory wishes to command the crossbowmen, perhaps it would be\nbetter to transmit your orders through me. The men do not understand why\nyou silenced them just now. They are not used to being told to stand\nlike statues for no reason.\"\n\n_And you would like to make yourself popular with them by disputing my\norder, would you not?_\n\n\"Tell them they have entered the service of the kingdom of France,\" he\ntold Sordello. \"It is customary for French soldiers to maintain a\nmilitary bearing and discipline.\"\n\n\"Forgive me, Your Signory, but that may offend them.\"\n\n\"It is not my duty to tell them what they want to hear but what they\n_must_ hear,\" said Simon. _Rather well put_, he thought to himself.\n\n\"S\u00ec, Your Signory.\" Sordello walked away. He had a slight limp, Simon\nnoticed. The man had certainly been battered. Even so, Uncle Charles's\nletter said he was a fine troubadour. Or trovatore, as they called them\nin Italy.\n\n\"Monseigneur!\" A shout broke in on his thoughts. Alain de Pirenne, his\nclosest friend among the six Gobignon knights he had brought with him,\nwas pointing out at the harbor. The two rows of oars on either side of\nthe long-delayed galley were in motion. Even at this distance Simon\ncould hear the drumbeat and the overseer calling count. Simon had heard\nsongs comparing the oars of galleys to the wings of birds, and he could\nsee the resemblance as the rows of oars, looking delicate as feathers\nfrom this distance, rose and fell over the water in unison.\n\n\"Thank heaven,\" said Simon.\n\n\"Indeed,\" said Alain. \"I am starting to feel more like a baked pigeon\nthan a man.\"\n\nAs the galley swung in to the wharf, ropes flying through the air to\nmake her fast to shore, Simon heard a sudden outcry behind him and\njerked his head around.\n\n\"Make way for the most serene! Make way for the doge!\" runners shouted.\nMusicians blowing oliphants, cranking hurdy-gurdies, and pounding on\ndrums led a bright procession along the wharves. Two men in knee-length\nscarlet tunics stiff with gold braid held poles between which swung a\nhuge banner. On the banner a winged lion in gold strode across a green\nbackground. Simon saw rows of gleaming helmets and naked swords held\nupright, followed by ranks of men in glittering brocaded robes, emerald\nand silver, maroon and gold. Towering over all was a huge sedan chair\nwith a gilded roof and cloth of gold curtains, followed by a troop of\nmen with tall spears. A crowd of men and women in bright silk tunics and\nsatin gowns, laughing and chattering, brought up the rear.\n\nA man in an ankle-length gown, his cap heavy with gold thread,\nconfronted Simon. He was, Simon recalled, a camerlengo who had been\npresent two weeks before when he had his brief audience with the doge\nand presented his charter from King Louis.\n\n\"Count, your troops are occupying the place needed by the doge, that he\nmay properly greet our guests. Move them, if you please.\" The \"if you\nplease\" was uttered in a tone so perfunctory as to be almost insulting.\nSimon's face burned and his muscles tensed, but when the ruler of Venice\ndemanded that he give way, he was in no position to quarrel. He bowed\ncurtly and turned to order his men to vacate the wharf.\n\nAnd so, after waiting for hours, Simon suddenly found himself watching\nthe arrival of the ambassadors from behind ranks of Venetian archers far\nmore smartly turned out than his own mercenaries.\n\nWhy, Simon wondered, had the doge not made a place for him in this\nwelcoming ceremony? The slight made him feel angry at himself as much as\nat the doge.\n\n_It is me. Uncle Charles should have sent an older man, more able to\ncommand respect._\n\nFirst to come down the boarding ramp of the galley from Cyprus was a\nfriar in a brown robe with a white cord wrapped around his waist. The\ncrown of his scalp was shaved, and his beard was long and white. He\nthrew himself on the ground and kissed it with a loud smacking sound. He\nrose and bowed to the doge's sedan chair.\n\nThe doge of Venice, Rainerio Zeno, emerged through curtains held for him\nby two equerries in purple. Zeno was a very old, toothless man whose\nblack eyes glittered like a raven's. His bald head was covered by a\nwhite cap bordered with pearls. His gold-embroidered mantle looked stiff\nand hard as the shell of a beetle. Pages stood on either side of him,\nand he leaned heavily on their shoulders, using them as crutches. The\nfriar bent and kissed Zeno's ring.\n\nSimon could not hear what the doge and the friar said to each other. The\nfriar gestured toward the ship. Armed men--Simon counted ten of\nthem--tramped down the boarding ramp and formed two lines leading to the\ndoge. They were short and swarthy, wearing red and black breastplates of\nlacquered leather and round steel helmets polished to a dazzling finish,\ntopped with spikes. Bows were slung crosswise over their shoulders, and\nlong, curved swords hung from their belts. Were these Tartars, he\nwondered.\n\nTheir swords looked very much like the one Simon wore. Simon's was an\nEgyptian scimitar, one of his most precious possessions, not because of\nits jeweled hilt--a pearl set just behind the guard, a ruby at the end\nof the hilt, and a row of smaller precious stones all along the\ngrip--but because of the one who had given it to him. And yet, much as\nhe prized it, the scimitar hurt him each time he looked at it, reminding\nhim of his darkest secret, a secret known to only three living people.\nSimon's whole life, the scimitar reminded him, was built on a lie.\n\nAnd he had accepted this mission, in part, to expiate the shame he felt\nwhen he remembered that.\n\nNow Simon, feeling very much out of his depth, touched the hilt of his\nscimitar for reassurance. But as he recalled that the sword had once\nbelonged to a Saracen ruler, his heart leapt in fear.\n\n_One never knows when or how the Saracens may strike_, Count Charles\nd'Anjou--Uncle Charles--had warned him. _The arrow from ambush ... the\ndagger that cuts the throat of a sleeping victim ... poison. When they\ncannot kill they try to corrupt, with gold and lies. And they have\nallies in Italy--the Pope's enemy, Manfred von Hohenstaufen, and his\nsupporters, the Ghibellini. You must be on guard every moment._\n\nSimon's eyes swept the row of stone palaces that overlooked this part of\nthe waterfront, their battlements offering hundreds of fine hiding\nplaces for killers. An enemy had only to gain surreptitious entrance to\none of those great houses--not hard to do when everyone's attention was\nturned toward the galley bringing the Tartars.\n\n_What should I do? The doge's men-at-arms outnumber mine, and look to be\nbetter soldiers. And it seems the Tartars have brought their own\nwarriors. Perhaps I am not needed now._\n\nThe thought brought him momentary relief. But then Simon realized that\nhe was yielding to the temptation that had assailed him throughout his\nlife, the urge to conceal himself.\n\n_But did I not undertake this task to uphold my family's good name and\nmy right to bear it? And besides, it is not only my dignity that must be\nupheld here, but the honor of King Louis. If anything happens to the\nTartars now that they are on Christian soil, I will have failed my\nking._\n\nSimon was about to push forward to demand room for his men when the\nfriar who had just disembarked raised his arm. Simon's gaze followed the\ndirection of the gesture, and came to rest at the head of the boarding\nramp.\n\nThere stood two of the strangest-looking men Simon had ever seen. Their\nfaces were the deep brown of well-tanned leather. The eyebrows were\nlittle black banners flying above black, slitted eyes that peered out\nover the battlements of jutting cheekbones. Their mustaches were thin\nand hung down in long strands below small chins adorned with sparse\nbeards. One man's beard was white, the other's black. But even the\nblack-bearded man was not young; there were deep creases in his face.\nBoth men wore cylindrical caps, each topped with a polished, spherical\nred stone. Their ankle-length robes were of maroon silk, brocaded with\ngold thread, and they wore short jackets with flowing sleeves. From the\nneck of each man hung a rectangular tablet on a gold chain.\n\nSimon's wonder turned to fear as he realized what perfect targets the\nTartar ambassadors were making of themselves.\n\nHe threw his weight against the men and women in front of him, forcing\nhis way through the crowd--and found himself facing one of the doge's\narchers. The man raised his crossbow threateningly, but Simon saw\nimmediately that it was not loaded. Fine protection for the emissaries.\n\n\"De Pirenne! De Puys!\" Simon called to the two French knights nearest\nhim. \"Follow me.\" He turned back to the Venetian crossbowman and\nshouted, \"Stand aside!\" in his loudest voice. \"I am the Count de\nGobignon.\"\n\nAs he had hoped, the sound of his command carried to Doge Zeno, whose\nface, wrinkled as a yellow raisin, turned in Simon's direction.\n\n\"Serenity!\" Simon called, using the customary form of address for the\ndoge. \"It is my duty to guard these ambassadors.\"\n\nSordello, at Simon's elbow, said in a low voice, \"You are a great lord\nin your own land, Your Signory, but it would be best if you did not\narouse the wrath of the doge of Venice.\"\n\n\"Be still,\" Simon snapped.\n\nHelmeted archers moved in on Simon from all sides, but Simon saw the\ndoge give an abrupt hand signal to their capitano. At a shouted order\nfrom the capitano, the men-at-arms fell back, letting Simon through.\n\n\"Why do you disturb our ceremonies, young count?\" The doge's voice was a\nhoarse whisper. He smiled faintly, but his eyes were cold as winter.\nSimon felt painfully embarrassed. The ruler of the mightiest city on the\nMiddle Sea was, after all, as puissant as any king on earth.\n\nSimon fell to one knee before the doge. \"Forgive me, Serenity. I only\nwish to aid you in protecting the emissaries from Tartary, as my king\nhas commanded me.\" His knees trembled, and he felt as if his heart were\nhammering hard enough to break his ribs.\n\nThe smile faded and the aged eyes grew icier. \"Does the Frankish count\nthink Venice too feeble to protect her distinguished visitors?\"\n\n\"Not at all, Serenity,\" said Simon hastily. \"Only let me add my strength\nto yours.\"\n\n\"Say no more,\" said the doge in a voice as sharp as a dagger.\n\nBy now the two Tartars had descended the ramp and were standing before\nthe doge. For a moment Simon's eyes met those of the white-bearded\nTartar, and he felt a new, inexplicable, and powerful fear. He took a\nstep backward, almost as if he had been struck a physical blow, and he\ngripped his sword hilt for reassurance.\n\nThe Tartar turned his gaze to the doge, and Simon's fear faded, leaving\nhim to wonder what there was in this little brown-skinned man to inspire\nit. What he had seen in those eyes? A hardness, a gaze as empty of\nconcern for Simon de Gobignon as the cloudless blue sky overhead.\n\nThe friar said, \"Serenity, this is John Chagan Noyon,\" indicating the\nolder Tartar. \"A noyon among the Tartars is equal in rank to a prince in\nour lands. The Khan Hulagu sends you a prince to show how earnestly he\nwishes to ally himself with Christendom to destroy our mutual enemies,\nthe Muslims. This other gentleman is Philip Uzbek Baghadur. 'Baghadur'\nmeans valiant, and he is a tuman-bashi, a commander of ten thousand. He\nholds high place in the councils of Hulagu Khan.\" Each Tartar clasped\nhis hands before him and bowed low to the doge as his name was spoken.\n\n\"How is it that they have Christian names?\" asked the doge.\n\nThe Franciscan friar smiled. \"John Chagan comes of an old Christian\nfamily, formerly subject to the great Christian King of Asia, Prester\nJohn. And Philip Uzbek was baptized in his youth by the Bishop of\nKarakorum.\"\n\nThe doge waved his bony hands, making his heavy garments rustle.\n\"Christian Tartars! Prester John! The Bishop of _Karakorum_? This is too\nmuch for an old man to grasp all at once. But surely I can learn much\nfrom you and these noble gentlemen that will be good for Venice. Tell\nthem that I invite them to bear me company to my palace, where we will\ndine together tonight and I will learn more of the marvels of the empire\nof Tartary.\"\n\nSimon knew that the doge's palace was more than half a mile down the\navenue along this bank of the Grand Canal, and the prospect of the\nambassadors parading that distance alarmed him again. His fear of\ndisaster came back full force, driving him once again, against all\ncourtesy, to speak out.\n\n\"Serenity! I beg the privilege of joining forces with you to escort the\nambassadors to your palace.\"\n\nAnger blazed in the gaze the doge turned upon him this time. \"Young man,\nif you speak out of turn once more, I will have you thrown into the\ncanal.\"\n\nSimon had no doubt that the doge would enjoy making good on his threat.\nBut would the ruler of Venice allow an undignified scuffle on the\nwaterfront in the presence of two ambassadors? Simon doubted it, and\ndecided to stand his ground.\n\n\"Forgive me, Serenity,\" he said, inclining his head. \"It is my concern\nfor these precious lives that urges me to speak out.\"\n\nThe doge took a deep breath. Then his small mouth twitched in a smile.\n\n\"Very well, Count. You may follow after us.\"\n\nWhile the doge presented the assembled Venetian dignitaries to the\nTartars, Simon ordered Henri de Puys and Alain de Pirenne to draw up the\nknights and Sordello to form up the archers and be ready to follow the\nambassadors' train.\n\nBearers brought a sedan chair for the Tartars, who climbed into it with\nbows and smiles. To Simon's distress, the conveyance was open, naturally\nenough, since the Tartars would want to see Venice and the Venetians\nwould want to see them. But it meant still more danger.\n\nThe Franciscan friar came over and put his hand on Simon's arm. \"You are\nvery brave, young man, to speak up to the ruler of Venice as you did.\nAnd who might you be?\"\n\nSimon introduced himself, and the friar bowed and addressed him in\nFrench. \"How good to speak the language of my homeland again. I am\nMathieu d'Alcon of the Little Brothers of San Francesco, and I was born\nnear Limoges, which is not far from your estate, Count. Of course, no\nplace in France is far from Gobignon lands.\" His broad smile told Simon\nthe remark was meant in friendly jest. \"It was our good King Louis who\nsent me to the Tartars years ago. I am glad we will be in French hands\nafter we leave Venice.\" He gave Simon's arm a squeeze and returned to\nthe doge's procession.\n\nSimon had begun to think the whole world had turned against him, and\nFriar Mathieu's friendly words cheered him immensely. He watched the\nwhite-bearded friar with a warm feeling as he shook his head at the\nattendants who held a sedan chair for him. As befitted a good\nFranciscan, sworn to poverty and dedicated to simplicity, the friar\nwould allow no one to carry him but insisted on walking on his own\nsandaled feet behind the Tartars' chair.\n\nSimon and his men followed the last contingent of the doge's foot\nsoldiers along the waterfront. Ahead, a stone bridge arched over one of\nthe many Venetian canals.\n\nThe procession was moving slowly now. After crossing the bridge, Simon\nsaw the ambassadors' sedan chair swing around a corner, and his pulse\nquickened because those he was to protect were out of his sight.\n\nHe wanted to hurry to the corner, but the street narrowed here, with the\nwindowless white ground floor of a palazzo on one side and an iron\nrailing on the other. There was no room to bypass those ahead. Simon\nhurried his pace until he was all but treading on the leather-shod heels\nof the spearman in front of him.\n\nHe turned the corner into the small square in front of the doge's\npalace. He saw the doge's sedan chair and that of the Tartars pass\nthrough the gateway between the palace and the great basilica of San\nMarco.\n\nThen he stopped short, feeling as if he had crashed headfirst into a\nwall. The tall gates leading into the palace swung shut, and facing him\nwas a triple line of men-at-arms of the Most Serene Republic, in green\nand gold tunics and armed with long spears.\n\n\"M\u00e8re de Dieu!\" he whispered.\n\nHe could not force his way into the palace. If he even tried, he would\nonly look ridiculous. Indeed, he doubted that his men would fight. The\nill-disciplined mercenaries were Venetians, too, and why would they obey\nthe command of a French seigneur, who had hired them only yesterday, to\nfight their own countrymen?\n\n\"It appears we are not welcome at the palace, Your Signory,\" said a\nvoice at his side. Simon turned and glared at Sordello, whose\nweather-beaten face seemed to mask amusement.\n\nSimon tried to think of a way to rescue his dignity. \"Find the leader of\nthe palace guards and tell him I want to speak to him.\"\n\nSordello shrugged. \"As you wish, Your Signory.\"\n\nAlain de Pirenne, his gauntleted fist clenched on the hilt of his sword,\nblustered out, \"Damned Italian discourtesy! It would serve them right if\nsomebody did slip a dagger into those Tartars while we stand out here.\"\n\n_God forbid!_ thought Simon.\n\nSordello came back with a Venetian man-at-arms, who touched the brim of\nhis polished kettle-helmet respectfully.\n\n\"This sergente has a message for you from His Serenity, the doge, Your\nSignory.\"\n\n\"Let him tell it.\"\n\nSimon's command of the Venetian dialect was not good enough to follow\nwhat the man in the kettle-helmet said, and to make it harder, he spoke\nin what appeared to be an embarrassed mumble.\n\n\"What did he say, Sordello?\"\n\n\"Forgive me, Your Signory,\" said Sordello. \"The message may offend you.\nI will repeat it only if you wish it.\"\n\n\"What did he say?\" said Simon again in a tight voice.\n\n\"The doge says you are to wait in quarters of your own choosing until\nthe ambassadors from Tartary are ready to travel. At that time he will\nplace them in your keeping. Until then you are to trouble him no more,\nunless you are a very good swimmer.\"\n\nSimon felt rage boil up within him. He clenched his fists and fought it\ndown.\n\n\"Tell him I thank His Serenity for his courtesy and will forever honor\nhim for it.\"\n\nSordello nodded, and there was a look of respect in his craggy face.\n\nAs Sordello repeated Simon's words to the sergente of the doge's guards,\nSimon wheeled and strode back the way he had come, to stare out to sea.\nTears of frustrated fury burned his eyes. He could feel hot blood\nbeating in his temples. The doge had treated him like a small boy. That\nold gargoyle had insulted him, had insulted the house of Gobignon, had\ninsulted King Louis.\n\nAnd there was nothing Simon could do about it. He felt furious and\nmiserable. A failure, at the very start of his task.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nCrushed, Simon decided that at least he would quarter his French knights\nand the Venetian archers as near to the doge's palace as possible. The\ndoge alone would be protecting the Tartars for the time being, and Simon\nhad no choice about it.\n\nWith Sordello's help he found lodgings for his men at the outrageous\nprice of two deniers a night per man--not all the thieves were on the\nhighways--at the nearest inn to the Piazza San Marco, just a short\ndistance down a side street. How much of what he paid the innkeeper, he\nwondered, would end up in Sordello's purse?\n\nThen, accompanied by Alain de Pirenne, he walked back to the entrance\ngate to the doge's palace, a long three-story building that stretched\nfrom the waterfront to the basilica. He sent a message in by way of a\nguard, asking Friar Mathieu to meet him in the piazza. The kindly\nFranciscan was, he suspected, the most important person in the Tartars'\nentourage.\n\nSimon and Alain had taken off their mail and were more comfortably\ndressed in silk tunics, short capes, and velvet caps. Each still wore\nhis weapons belt, with longsword hung on the left and dagger on the\nright. The leather heels of their point-toed boots rang on the stones of\nthe piazza as they paced, waiting to see if Friar Mathieu would come\nout.\n\nAlain was still indignant.\n\n\"They have no idea who you are, Simon. Why, you could take this whole\ncity and set it in one corner of the Gobignon domain and it would never\nbe noticed.\" Normally ruddy, Alain was even redder with anger. His blond\nmustache bristled.\n\n_As much as Paris goes unnoticed in the midst of the \u00cele de France_,\nSimon thought with a smile.\n\nNow that his armor was off and an hour or more had passed, Simon felt\nmore at ease and was inclined to accept the situation. After all, if he\ncould not get into the doge's palace, he might reasonably hope that\nneither could anyone who would want to harm the Tartars.\n\n\"It is wealth and ships that make this city great, Alain, not its size.\"\n\n\"That is all these Venetians care about--money.\" Like any proper knight,\nAlain despised money and those who loved it. In the course of learning\nto manage his estate, Simon had acquired more respect for money.\n\n\"Even Paris has no beauty to rival this,\" said Simon, feeling a shade\ndisloyal even as he said so. \"Look at those horses.\" He pointed to the\nfa\u00e7ade above the central doorway of the cathedral of San Marco, where\nfour gilded bronze horses pranced, so proud and energetic as to seem\nalmost in motion.\n\nAlain whistled in appreciation. \"What wizard wrought them, I wonder.\"\n\nSimon, who had been asking questions in the week they had been there,\nsaid, \"They come from Constantinople. About sixty years ago the\nVenetians paid an army of French crusaders--our forefathers--to turn\naside from the Holy Land and conquer Constantinople instead. The\nVenetians took those horses and set them here to proclaim their\ntriumph.\"\n\n\"Diverting a crusade is surely a great sin,\" said Alain. \"And theft is\ntheft. But none of my forefathers had anything to do with the foul deed\nyou tell of.\"\n\n\"No, nor mine,\" said Simon. \"The French knights who conquered\nConstantinople were our forefathers only in a manner of speaking.\"\n\n_But my predecessor, Count Amalric de Gobignon, did fouler things by\nfar. As Alain well knows, though he is too good a friend to mention\nit._\n\n\"Still, the good taste of the Venetians is admirable,\" Simon said aloud,\nstill gazing at the horses.\n\n\"For all I know, this could be the richest city in the world,\" said\nAlain, missing the point. \"But what matter, Simon, if its riches are\nstolen goods?\"\n\n\"Venice is by no means the richest city in the world, Messire,\" someone\nbeside them said.\n\nStartled, Simon turned to see Friar Mathieu, who had fallen into step\nwith them, his eyes warm and friendly. Simon wanted to throw his arms\naround the old man and hug him.\n\n\"There are cities in the Far East so big and so rich they make Venice\nlook like a fishing village,\" Friar Mathieu went on, his long white\nbeard blowing gently in the breeze from the waterfront.\n\n\"People love to tell wild stories about the East,\" said Alain\nskeptically. \"I've heard of cities of solid gold, birds as big as an\nelephant, and so on and on.\"\n\n_But this man has been there!_ Simon wanted to shout. Much though he\nliked Alain, Simon was discovering in his friend a narrowness that made\nhim a frustrating traveling companion. With Alain here, the conversation\nwith Friar Mathieu would plod, and Simon wanted it to gallop.\n\n\"Sire Alain,\" he said, \"I fear our hired men-at-arms may get into\ntrouble drinking, fighting, and wenching unless someone keeps a sharp\neye on them. Will you see to them, please?\"\n\nDe Pirenne held up a broad hand. \"I will slap them down for you, if need\nbe, Monseigneur.\" Now that a third party was present, he addressed Simon\nformally.\n\n\"Travel is said to open a man's mind,\" said Friar Mathieu when de\nPirenne was gone. \"But some minds are like country ch\u00e2teaus. Let\nanything strange approach, and the doors and windows slam shut.\"\n\nHe took Simon's arm and steered him over the flagstones of the piazza\ntoward the cathedral. The many-columned fa\u00e7ade of pink, white, and green\nmarble, sculptures, and mosaics filling the spaces between them took\nSimon's breath away. There was an opulence to the five great domes that\nseemed to Simon to speak of the storied wealth of the East. They were so\ndifferent from the pointed spires of the cathedrals newly built in\nFrance.\n\n\"I am very grateful to you, Simon, for trying so hard to protect us\ntoday,\" Friar Mathieu said. \"The doge's discourtesy to you was the\nworst kind of rudeness, the rudeness of one who thinks himself more\nrefined than all others.\"\n\nSimon felt better, but he wondered if the friar was speaking so only out\nof kindness to him.\n\n\"It is good of you to reassure me,\" he said, \"but the doge seems to be\nguarding the ambassadors well enough.\"\n\n\"All show,\" said Friar Mathieu. \"The Venetians are not alert enough. The\ndoge has no idea that we are in any danger. Nor does he seem to care. I\nbelieve he has not decided whether he has anything to gain from an\nalliance between Christians and Tartars. After all, the Venetians trade\nquite happily with the Muslims these days.\"\n\nSimon was shocked. \"Is that not a sin?\"\n\n\"Against God, perhaps, but not against profit. And the common heading on\nyour Venetian merchant's account book is 'For God and Profit.' Young\nSeigneur de Gobignon, you do not know how happy I am to talk to a\nFrenchman again after so many years.\"\n\n\"How long have you been among the Tartars, Friar Mathieu?\"\n\nThe old Franciscan sighed. \"Long enough to learn the Eastern peoples'\nway of counting the years in twelve-year cycles. They give each year the\nname of a certain animal.\"\n\n\"A strange system.\"\n\n\"A sensible system. It is easier to remember beasts than numbers. Let me\nsee, this year, Anno Domini 1263, they call the Year of the Sheep, and\nwhen I first entered the camp of Hulagu Khan the Tartars told me it was\nthe Year of the Dragon. From Dragon to Sheep there are\"--he counted on\nhis fingers while muttering the names of beasts under his breath--\"seven\nanimals. So, seven years since our good King Louis sent me to bear his\nmessages to the Tartars.\"\n\n\"Then you went in 1256?\"\n\n\"Anno Domini 1256. That is right.\"\n\nSimon wanted very much to know more about life among the Tartars. But he\nand the old friar could have long talks on the road to Orvieto. For now\nthere were more pressing questions.\n\nJust as he was about to speak, the friar pointed to the gateway between\nthe basilica and the doge's palace. \"There go the Armenians.\"\n\nSimon saw six of the swarthy men crossing the piazza in a line.\nShort-statured though they were, there was a swagger in the way they\nwalked. They had doffed their leather armor and wore tunics of white\nsilk with billowing red trousers over short black boots. Their tunics\nwere cinched at the waist with black leather belts, and in each belt was\nthrust a curving saber in a jeweled scabbard. Their bows were slung\nacross their backs, along with black leather quivers.\n\n\"Four of them stayed behind to guard the Tartars,\" Friar Mathieu said.\n\nSimon had been wondering just how his knights and archers would share\nwith the Armenian guards the responsibility of protecting the Tartars.\n\n\"Why did the ambassadors bring Armenians, and not their own Tartar\nwarriors?\" he asked Friar Mathieu.\n\n\"Because the Armenians are Christians and are more like Europeans than\nthemselves. The Armenians are allies, not subjects of the Tartars. These\nten who travel with us are great men among the Armenian people. One of\nthem, Hethum, is in line to be King of Armenia some day. One feels\nsafer, traveling with such men.\"\n\nSimon watched the half-dozen Armenians disappear down a narrow side\nstreet leading off the piazza. He felt a twinge of worry, seeing that\nthey were heading toward the street in which his own men were quartered.\nHe wanted to follow after the men from the East, but he did not want to\ninterrupt his conversation with Friar Mathieu. Feeling pulled in two\ndirections, he held himself to the friar's slow, thoughtful pace as they\napproached the cathedral.\n\n\"Even some Tartars are Christians, I have heard,\" Simon said.\n\n\"There are many religions among the Tartars.\" They had reached the front\nof San Marco, and Friar Mathieu, still holding Simon's arm, wheeled them\naround and started them walking back toward the doge's palace. \"Hulagu\nKhan's wife, the Khatun, is a Christian, although he is a pagan. But\nwhat all Tartars really worship is strength. In their own language they\ncall themselves 'Mongols,' which means strong.\" Simon looked at the\nfriar and saw a faraway, awe-struck look in those old eyes. \"One wonders\nwhy God created them. To punish us for our sins? Or to rule the world\nand to bring order to all mankind?\"\n\n\"Rule the world?\" said Simon. He thought about the two slit-eyed men in\nsilk robes he had seen disembarking from the galley a few hours before.\nHe remembered the look the older Tartar had given him, so unfeeling, as\nif looking down upon him from a vast distance.\n\n\"They think it is their destiny to rule the world,\" said Friar Mathieu.\n\"And it is not a foolish dream. They have already conquered much of it.\nYou might sneer at me as your skeptical knight did, Monseigneur, if I\ntold you how vast the Tartar empire is. Take France, England, and the\nHoly Roman Empire together, and they would be swallowed up in the lands\nruled by the Tartars.\"\n\n\"Please call me Simon, Father, if you will. It embarrasses me to be\naddressed as monseigneur by one such as you.\"\n\nFriar Mathieu patted Simon's hand. \"Very well, Simon. That is kindly\nspoken. It will be good for us to be friends, because we have a very\ndifficult and doubtful mission.\"\n\n\"Why doubtful?\"\n\n\"We cannot be sure we are doing the right thing. These two men, John and\nPhilip, command great armies in the Tartar empire. Watch them, Simon.\nNotice how they observe fortifications and weapons. The same monks who\nmade Christians of them also taught them how to write. Many times at\nday's end in Syria and on Cyprus I have seen them talking together,\nmaking notes, drawing maps. Whether they form this alliance or not, they\nwill have much useful knowledge to bring back to their khan.\"\n\n_Then might it not be better for all of us if I fail to protect the\nTartars, and some enemy of Christendom succeeds in killing them?_\n\nSimon felt an aching tightness in his forehead. He desperately wanted\nthe alliance to succeed, and thereby show the nobility of France that\nneither he nor his family any longer deserved their scorn. If the\nalliance failed, he failed, and the house of Gobignon would sink deeper\ninto dishonor.\n\nLet others worry, he decided, about whether it was right or wrong to\nprotect the Tartars.\n\n\"Monseigneur!\"\n\nThere was urgency in the voice that hailed Simon from across the square,\nand a feeling of dread came over him. He turned to see his equerry,\nThierry d'Hauteville, his wavy black hair uncovered, running across the\npiazza.\n\n\"They are fighting, Monseigneur!\" Thierry panted. \"Our Venetian archers\nand those men from Tartary. You'd best come at once.\"\n\n\"Jesus, save us!\" Simon heard Friar Mathieu whisper beside him.\n\nStaring into Thierry's anxious eyes, Simon felt himself getting angry.\nSix knights he had brought with him. Any knight worthy of his spurs\nshould be able to stop any pack of commoners from fighting. And if they\ncould not, he thought with a sudden shift from anger to anxiety, what\nmore could he do?\n\nThere was no time to think. \"Father, will you come, please?\" he said to\nMathieu, and without waiting for a reply struck Thierry on the shoulder\nand began to run with him.\n\n\"I follow, as quickly as I can, my son,\" he heard from behind him.\n\n\"Could you not stop them?\" he demanded of Thierry as they headed down a\nnarrow cobblestoned street at a dead run.\n\nDread made his legs heavy. De Puys, a veteran of the last crusade, de\nPirenne, a strong and well-trained knight--_they_ had sent for _him_.\nFor Simon de Gobignon, twenty years of age, who had never in his life\nbeen in a battle.\n\nBreath of God, what did they expect of him?\n\n\"There was nothing we could do without killing the Tartars' bodyguard,\"\nsaid Thierry. \"You will see how it is when you get there.\"\n\nThe inn was a stone building with houses on either side. The lower half\nof the divided door was shut, but the upper half was open, and Simon\nheard shouts from within. Thierry, ahead of him, yanked the door open\nfor him.\n\nIt took his eyes a moment to adjust to the darkness of the large room.\nShadowy figures jostled him as he pushed his way through. A little light\ncame from the grilled windows and from a single huge yellow candle\nburning in a candlestick on a table. The room reeked of sweaty bodies\nand old wine.\n\n\"Make way for Monseigneur le Comte!\" Thierry called uselessly as the\nVenetian mercenaries jabbered angrily in Italian.\n\nSimon pushed his way into the corner of the room lit by the candle and\nfound himself facing a scowling, dark-skinned man pointing a gleaming\nsword at him. Five of the Armenians, sabers out, had formed a protective\nring.\n\nWithin the ring, the sixth Armenian had a man bent forward over a table.\nThe man's arms flailed feebly and his eyes bulged. Even in the poor\nlight Simon could see that his face, turned on its side toward him, was\npurple. The Armenian was holding his bow behind the man's neck and was\nturning it slowly. Now Simon saw the string cutting into the neck.\n\nIt hurt Simon to look at what was happening. He felt his own breath cut\noff, his heart pounding as if he were laboring for air. He wanted to\nturn away and knew he could not. He must somehow stop this before that\nVenetian died.\n\n\"Blood of God!\" he whispered. He recognized the darkened, distorted\nface.\n\nSordello.\n\nAll around Simon the Venetians were edging closer to the Armenians,\ntheir daggers gleaming in the candlelight. But none of the foot soldiers\nwanted to be the first to brave those sabers.\n\nThat meant, Simon thought, heart pounding, that he would have to face\nthem.\n\n_Where the devil are my knights?_\n\nLooking to the right and left Simon saw Alain, Henri de Puys, and the\nfour others, swords out but--like himself--unarmored, standing\nirresolutely between the Venetians and the Armenians. Against one wall\nhe saw a huddle of women, their bare bosoms gleaming in the dim light.\nStanding protectively in front of the women was a man Simon recognized\nas the innkeeper. For the price Simon was paying, why could not this man\nkeep order in his own house?\n\n\"Aha, now we have the stinking figlii di cagne!\" a man behind Simon\ncried. Simon turned and saw a crossbow leveled at shoulder height. He\nhad ordered that the Venetians' weapons be kept under lock and key.\nEvidently someone had broken them out. Once the rest of the Venetians\narmed themselves with their bows, the Armenians would be slaughtered.\n\nSimon's body grew hot with anger. He would like to kill the fool who\nhelped the Venetians to their arms.\n\nBut the Armenians had their bows, too, and one by one they started to\nunsling them. Simon heard the ominous squeaking as the Venetians wound\nback their crossbow strings. The Armenians would never be able to get\ntheir arrows nocked and their bows drawn before the crossbow bolts began\nto fly.\n\nSimon's actions followed instantly on his thoughts. \"Cessi!\" he shouted,\nhoping the Venetians would understand him.\n\nNow all eyes were turned toward him. The muscles of his belly tightened\nas he cast about in his mind for the right thing to do.\n\nThe hands of the Venetians hesitated on their crossbows as they\nrecognized their master.\n\n\"De Pirenne, de Puys, the rest of you. Make our men put down their\ncrossbows.\"\n\nBut just as Simon spoke, the Armenian strangling Sordello gave another\nturn to his bow, and the old bravo gagged and gasped.\n\nSimon realized that if he drew his scimitar, the room would be a charnel\nhouse in moments. He approached the Armenian nearest him, spreading his\nhands to show their emptiness. He prayed that the man, whose bow and\narrow was aimed at his chest, would not see how those outstretched hands\nwere trembling.\n\nIn his strongest voice he said, \"Hold your arrow!\" hoping the man would\nunderstand his tone. As he spoke, he firmly grasped the arrow near its\nhead and pushed it aside. His heart thudded, and he could almost feel\nthat steel tip stabbing into his chest. And how bare was his back to the\ncrossbow quarrels!\n\nThe Armenian took a step to the side and let Simon pass. Simon let out a\ndeep breath of relief. As he stepped forward, the soles of his boots\nslid a little. The floor, he realized, must be slippery with spilled\nwine.\n\nNow he was facing the man who was murdering Sordello. A vagrant thought\nstruck Simon: _I do not like Sordello. I would not mind if the Armenian\nkilled him. Why risk my life for him?_\n\n_Because a good seigneur is loyal to his men_, the answer came at once.\n\nHe spoke commandingly but softly. \"Stop. This is my man and you must not\nkill him. Let him go.\" He put his hand firmly on the forearm of the\nArmenian, who was a good deal shorter than he was. The man's dark brows\ndrew together in a puzzled frown. He was studying Simon's face. Simon\ncould feel a faint tremor in the muscles under his hand.\n\nAny man would be frightened at a moment like this, no matter how brave,\nhow hardened, Simon thought. But he saw that the Armenian's face was\nunlined, his eyes clear. His black mustache was small and fine.\n\n_He must be about my age. Maybe even younger._\n\nSimon felt a warmth toward the young Armenian, and hoped he could win\nhim over. But how could such a pleasant-looking fellow bring himself to\nstrangle a man with a bowstring? Perhaps Sordello had done something\ntruly evil.\n\n\"Come now,\" Simon said, giving the young man's arm a gentle shake. \"Do\nlet him go.\" He essayed a smile, hoping it would look friendly.\n\nThe Armenian let out a deep sigh and closed his eyes. Then he released\nhis grip on the bow. He slapped it with one hand to make it twirl. Simon\nheard a faint choking sound from Sordello, and then the Italian slid to\nthe stone floor.\n\nA woman, her henna-dyed hair gleaming red-gold in the candlelight,\nrushed to the young Armenian and held his arm, talking soothingly in\nItalian. He stiffened at first, then smiled at her.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Simon to the Armenian, shaky with relief.\n\nHe smiled and patted the dark man's free arm, feeling foolish about his\nsimple words of gratitude. If only Friar Mathieu would get here so that\nhe could talk to these men from the East.\n\nA cool feeling of relief bathed Simon. So far all had gone amazingly\nwell. But, he reminded himself, this was not over yet. He must continue\nto think quickly.\n\n\"De Puys, clear the Venetians out of here. Assemble them outside. Then\nmarch them away from this street altogether. And collect their crossbows\nand get them locked up again. You should never have let them get at\nthose weapons. De Pirenne, you stay here and tell me what happened.\"\n\n\"Well, this is how it was, Monseigneur,\" said Alain, looking abashed.\n\"Our men were drinking quietly, and this redheaded woman was sitting\nwith Sordello. Then these men from Tartary came in. They made no\ntrouble, just sat down in their own corner. But the woman, she took a\nfancy to that man you saw trying to kill Sordello. She served him wine\nand sat down with him. Sordello went over and tried to get her back.\nThere were words. They didn't understand each other, but the meaning was\nclear. Sordello went for the other with a knife. And then the other man\n_kicked_ it out of his hand--rather a surprise, that was--to Sordello,\ntoo, I think. And the next thing I know he was strangling Sordello and\nhis companions would not let anyone stop it. Sordello had the key to the\nstoreroom where the crossbows were kept. After the Armenian seized him,\nhe threw it to one of the Venetians.\"\n\nA typical muddle, Simon thought, like most of the cases brought to him\nfor justice since he had become Seigneur of Gobignon. He felt disgusted\nwith all these fools. No saying who was at fault. Most likely the damned\nwoman. Thank the Virgin he did not have to fix blame, just put a stop to\nthe fighting.\n\nSordello, who had been lying curled up on the floor, suddenly lashed out\nwith a booted foot.\n\nThe woman screamed. As Simon stared, the young Armenian fell heavily to\nthe wine-wet floor. Sordello sprang upon him, and a dagger flashed. He\nwas striking at the Armenian's chest.\n\nSimon had no time to feel the panic that flooded through him. He grabbed\nfor Sordello's arm, too late to stop the dagger but pulling it back so\nthat it drove upward through the muscles of the chest instead of\nplunging deep. The Armenian bellowed in pain. With all his strength,\nSimon yanked Sordello off the Armenian and threw him backward. De\nPirenne caught him and held him.\n\nShouting in their own language and brandishing their swords, the other\nArmenians rushed at Sordello.\n\nA familiar voice cried out a sentence in a strange tongue. Friar Mathieu\nrushed into the circle of candlelight, his white beard flying, his arms\nupraised. At his sudden appearance the Armenians, who were ready to make\nmincemeat of Sordello--and perhaps de Pirenne with him--hesitated.\n\n_Oh, thank God!_ The weight of struggling to control this dreadful\nsituation was no longer Simon's alone to bear.\n\nFriar Mathieu spoke several sentences to the Armenians. Simon could not\ntell from his tone whether he was scolding them or trying to placate\nthem. There were in the room five angry men who looked to be formidable\nfighters, armed with swords and bows and arrows. And, Simon realized, he\nhad just sent away all but one of his knights and all of his\ncrossbowmen.\n\nSimon cursed himself for letting Sordello wound the young man.\n\n_Alain said Sordello dropped a dagger. Why did I not think to look for\nit?_\n\nHe felt himself growing hot and cold as he realized this incident might\nwreck everything--for Christendom, for Louis, and for the honor of the\nHouse of Gobignon.\n\nNow Friar Mathieu fell to his knees beside the young Armenian, whose\nwhite tunic was splashed deep scarlet with blood. He spoke comforting\nwords to him and then turned an agonized face to Simon.\n\n\"This is Prince Hethum,\" said the friar. \"The Tartars will be furious\nwhen they learn what has happened. This may destroy any chance of an\nalliance. At the very least, they will demand satisfaction.\"\n\n_I am to protect these emissaries, and one of my own men has stabbed a\nprince of Armenia._\n\nDespair was an ache in Simon's chest.\n\n\"What sort of satisfaction?\"\n\n\"I fear they will require that man's life,\" said Friar Mathieu sadly.\n\n\"By God's beard, I have done no wrong!\" Sordello rasped. His voice was a\ncroak.\n\n\"Be silent!\" Simon snapped, his rage against himself turning to fury at\nSordello. \"You are a fool, but being a fool will not save you.\"\n\n\"Your Signory!\" Sordello cried. \"How could I let him take the woman from\nme? My honor--\"\n\n\"_Your_ honor!\" Simon raged. \"What is your wandering blackguard's honor\ncompared to the honor of France? The woman chose him over you. Look at\nher.\"\n\nSordello glared at Simon, but was silent. The red-haired woman crouched\nover the fallen Prince Hethum, crooning softly in Italian.\n\n_And yet, Uncle Charles would not want me to sacrifice Sordello. And the\nArmenian did try to kill him. My knights and men-at-arms will lose all\nrespect for me if I let the Tartars have their way with Sordello._\n\n_But if he goes unpunished, if the Armenian prince goes unrevenged,\nthere will be no alliance at all._\n\nAnd it would be his fault. The little honor that was left to the House\nof Gobignon would be lost.\n\nA wave of anger at himself swept over him. Had he dedicated himself to\nthe alliance only so that he might free himself from the agony of his\nguilty secret and his house from dishonor? He thought of King Louis and\nhow pure was his desire to win back for Christendom the places where\nChrist had lived. How impure were Simon's own motives!\n\nAs long as he put his own needs first, he would continue to deserve the\nburdens of guilt and shame.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\n    In the Name of God, the Beneficent, the Merciful.\n    All praise be to God, Lord of the Worlds.\n    Master of the Day of Judgment.\n\nDaoud stood perfectly still, looking into the violet sky, reciting in\nhis mind the salat, the prayer required of a Muslim five times daily.\nThis was Mughrab, the moment when the last light of sunset had drained\naway. An evening breeze cooled his face, welcome after a day of\ntraveling under the summer sky of Italy. Oriented by a bright crescent\nmoon just rising, he faced southeast, toward Mecca. His back was to the\nstone wall of the inn called the Capo di Bue, the Ox's Head, where he\nand Sophia and Celino had decided to spend the night. On the other side\nof the wall, loud voices contended for attention, the sound of travelers\nin the common room settling down to supper.\n\nPraying in the dusk reminded Daoud that he was alone. What would it be\nlike now in El Kahira, the Guarded One? He would be praying with\nhundreds of fellow Muslimin, standing shoulder to shoulder, all equal\nbefore God, in the Gray Mosque, all listening to the call of the blind\nmuezzins from the minarets--\"Come to the house of praise. God is\nAlmighty. There is no god but God.\"--all facing the Prophet's birthplace\ntogether in holy submission. Daoud's prayer might be the only one going\nup to God tonight from anywhere near Rome.\n\nAll around him towered ruins. The silhouettes of broken columns rose\nagainst the darkening sky, and across the Appian Way the ragged shape of\nwhat had once been a wall. Pines stood tall and black where, according\nto Lorenzo, some wealthy woman of ancient Rome had her tomb.\n\nHe tried to forget his surroundings and to think only of the salat. It\nwas hard to concentrate when he could not assume the proper positions\nfor prayer--raise his hands, kneel, strike his forehead on the ground.\nHe fixed his mind on the infinity of God.\n\n\"Do not try to see Him,\" Abu Hamid al-Din Saadi had told him. \"If you\nsee Him in your mind, you are looking at an idol.\"\n\nDaoud did not try to see God, but as he prayed, a Muslim all alone in\nthe heart of Christendom, he could not help but see Sheikh Saadi, the\nSufi master who had brought him to Islam.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe face was very dark, the rich black of a cup of kaviyeh. Out of the\nblackness peered eyes that _saw_--saw into the very souls of his\nstudents.\n\nOften as he sat listening to Sheikh Saadi read from the Koran, the Book\nto be Read, and explain its meaning, voices from the past reproached\nhim. The voice of Father Adrian, the chaplain of their castle, rang in\nhis mind. The quiet voice of his mother, teaching him the Lord's Prayer\nand the Hail Mary, whispered to him. Like thunder his father spoke of\nwar and of what it was to be a knight.\n\nHe could escape the torment of these voices only by listening closely to\nthe Sufi sheikh. Saadi was trying to teach him how to be good, and that\nwas the same thing his mother and father had wanted for him. So they\nwould not mind if he learned from Saadi.\n\nSheikh Saadi, wearing the white woolen robe of a Sufi, sat on a\nmany-colored carpet of Mosul, an open copy of the Koran resting on an\nornately carved lectern before him. His hand, as dark as the mahogany of\nthe stand, caressed the page as he read aloud.\n\n\"'Such as persevere in seeking their Lord's countenance and are regular\nin prayer and spend of that which We bestow upon them secretly and\nopenly, and overcome evil with good: Theirs will be the Heavenly Home.'\"\n\n_Mohammedan dogs!_ Daoud remembered Father Adrian in his black and white\nrobes shouting in the chapel at Ch\u00e2teau Langmuir. _Satan is the author\nof that vile book they call the Koran._\n\nBy the age of eleven Daoud had already known cruelty and evil at the\nhands of the Turks who had captured him, kindness with Baibars, and\ngoodness with Sheikh Saadi. The Sufi sheikh had never made any claim,\nbut Daoud had no doubt that he often walked and talked with God.\n\n\"Secretly and openly are we to give,\" the old man was saying. \"God has\nbeen generous to us, and we must be generous in turn. When you are kind\nto a bird or a donkey, or even to an unclean animal like a pig or a dog,\nHe loves you for it. He loves you more when you are kind to a slave or\nto a woman or to one of the unfortunate, like a cripple or an\nunbeliever.\"\n\n\"Daoud is both a slave and unbeliever,\" said Gamal ibn Nasir with a\nfaint sneer. \"Must I be kind to him?\" Daoud stared at Gamal, burning\nwith hatred, all the more because what he said was true.\n\nGamal was a slender, olive-skinned boy whom no one dared cross, because\nhe was a grandson of the reigning Sultan of Egypt, Al Salih Ayub. Most\nof Saadi's students were boys of noble family, and Daoud knew that he\nwas permitted to enter this circle only because all men feared and\nrespected Baibars. And even though he studied Islam with them because it\nwas Baibars's wish, Daoud remained fil-kharij, an outsider, because he\nwas an unbeliever.\n\nThe boys sat in a semicircle, their rectangles of carpet spread over the\nblue and white tiles of the inner courtyard of the Gray Mosque, where\nSaadi had been teaching since long before these students were born. The\nold black man sat with his back to the gray stones of the western wall,\nthe stones that gave the mosque its name. He taught in the late\nafternoon, when he and the boys could sit in the shade.\n\n\"God is compassion itself, Gamal,\" Sheikh Saadi said with a smile, \"but\neven He may find it hard to love a mean spirit.\" The sultan's grandson\nblushed angrily, and his eyes fell.\n\nThinking about the compassion of God, Daoud opened his eyes wide as a\nstartling idea occurred to him. But after the insult from Gamal his\ntongue felt thick in his throat and the palms of his hands went cold at\nthe thought of speaking. He still stumbled over the Arabic tongue in\nwhich Sheikh Saadi conducted his lessons.\n\nSaadi looked warmly upon him. \"Daoud has a question?\"\n\nDaoud stared down at his hands, which seemed very large as they lay in\nhis lap. \"Yes, master.\" Those kindly velvet-black eyes seemed to draw\nspeech out of him. \"If God loves the compassionate, how can he look with\nfavor upon the warrior, who wounds and kills?\"\n\nSaadi's turbaned head lifted. His grizzled beard thrust forward, and his\neyes grew round and serious. He looked, Daoud thought, like a\nthoroughbred steed pricking up his ears to a trumpet call.\n\n\"I say to you, Daoud, and to Gamal and to all of you--the work of a\nwarrior is a holy calling. When the Prophet Muhammad, may God bless and\nsalute him, began to teach, he did not want the believers to be men of\nthe sword. But the pagans beat those who went to hear him, and they\nwould not let him teach. And so he learned that a true man of God must\ngo forth with the Book in one hand and the sword in the other.\"\n\nDaoud felt a warm pride in his chest. He was not a despicable slave. He\nwould one day be a warrior, in a way a holy man, like Saadi, who helped\nspread the teachings of God.\n\n_But I am an unbeliever._\n\nHe listened for the Frankish voices in his mind crying out against the\nSaracens, against the devilish religion of the one they called Mahound.\nBut the voices were silent.\n\nA pale boy with a grave face asked, \"If God made man, how can He love\none who butchers His creatures?\"\n\nSheikh Saadi raised an admonishing finger. \"The Warrior of God is no\nbutcher. He strikes with sorrow and compassion. He hates evil, but he\nloves his fellow men, even the one he fights against. The Warrior of God\nis known, not by his willingness to kill, but by his willingness to die.\nHe is a man who would give his life for his friends.\"\n\nSaadi went on to speak of other things, but Daoud's mind remained fixed\non the words \"Warrior of God.\"\n\nEver since the day the Saracens carried him off, he had lived without a\nhome. He had drunk from gold cups in the palace of Baibars, had seen\nthat a Mameluke might rise to earthly glory. But such rewards fell to\nonly one in a thousand. For the rank and file, the life of a Mameluke\nwas a hard one, often ending in early death.\n\nLately Baibars had sent him to live with the other Mameluke boys in\ntraining on the island of Raudha in the Bhar al-Nil, the river Nile.\nEvery morning, when he woke to the rapping of the drill master's stick\non the wooden wall of his sleeping shed, his first feeling was anguish.\nSometimes he prayed before sleeping that he might not wake up again.\nOnly when he journeyed twice a week, by boat and on foot, to sit at the\nfeet of Saadi, did he feel any peace.\n\nBut what if God had chosen him to be a Mameluke? Then it was a blessed\nlife, a holy calling, as Saadi had said. There was a world beyond this\none, a place the Koran called a \"Heavenly Home.\" All men, Christian and\nMuslim, believed that. As a warrior he could hope that his hardship\nwould be turned to joy in that Heavenly Home. In that world, not one in\nten thousand, but every good man, would dwell in a palace.\n\nAbsorbed in his own thoughts, he heard the soft, deep voice of Saadi as\none hears the constant murmur of the windblown sand in the desert. The\nboys around him and the men who came and went in the Gray Mosque--all\nwere believers. As a warrior of God he could be part of that, and not\nthe least part. He would no longer be fil-kharij, a stranger in this\nworld. He would be fil-dakhil, at home.\n\nThe lesson was over. The boys stood with Saadi and bowed their heads in\nprayer. After the prayers they bowed again to their teacher and, alone\nor in pairs, pattered out of the courtyard of the Gray Mosque.\n\nWhen they were all gone, Daoud stood alone facing Saadi.\n\n\"What does Daoud have to say to me?\"\n\nIn a rush of love for his master, Daoud threw himself to his knees and\nstruck his forehead on Saadi's red carpet, bumping his head hard enough\nto be slightly stunned.\n\n\"What is it, Daoud?\" Saadi's voice was a comforting rumble.\n\nDaoud sat back and looked up. The figure of the Sufi towered over him.\nBut Saadi bent his head, and looking into the dark face, Daoud felt as\nif someone huge and powerful had taken him into his arms.\n\n\"Master, I want to embrace Islam.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDaoud was mentally repeating the salat for the third time when he heard\nfootsteps and the click of hooves coming up the road. He shut his eyes\nto resist the distraction.\n\nA voice interrupted the fourth repetition. \"Peace be unto you, Signore.\nCan you tell me if there is room at the sign of the Capo di Bue for my\nson and me and our donkey?\"\n\nDaoud was annoyed at having to stop his prayers, but he had to reply or\ncall unwanted attention to himself. He opened his eyes and saw in the\nshadows before him a short man with a full white beard holding the reins\nof a donkey that breathed heavily and shifted its feet nervously on the\ngreat black paving stones of the Appian Way. A second figure, obscure in\nthe darkness, sat on the donkey. The two seemed heavily dressed for\nsummer. The bearded man wore a round black hat with a narrow brim, of a\ntype Daoud had never seen before.\n\n\"It is not overly full,\" he said impatiently.\n\nBut the man with the black hat still stood before him. \"Are you sure\nthat we will be welcome, Signore?\"\n\n\"You can pay for a place in the common bed, can you not?\" said Daoud,\neager to finish the prayer.\n\n\"Oh, we do not require a bed, Signore,\" said the old man. \"We will sleep\nin the stable, or sit up\"--he chuckled--\"or even sleep standing up, as\nour donkey does. It is just that we cannot go farther tonight. Rome has\nmore robbers than a dog has fleas.\"\n\nWhy in the name of God was the man so hesitant? Daoud, seeing no need to\ncontinue the conversation, remained silent.\n\nThe old man sighed. \"Peace be to you, Signore,\" he said again. \"Come, my\nson.\"\n\nThe man's son climbed down, and the two travelers pulled the donkey\nthrough the inn's gate. Leather packs hung from either side of the\ndonkey, and Daoud wondered what was in them. Probably nothing of value,\nbut robbers would attack anyone who looked vulnerable, and the old man's\nfear was doubtless justified.\n\nDaoud thought of the precious stones he and Celino carried between\nthem. He felt the cold breath of danger on the back of his neck.\n\n_Here in this inn they may all be honest men, but if they knew what\nwealth we had, even honest men would try to cut our throats._\n\nHe turned his mind again to his prayers. By the time he finished and\nturned to go through the gate leading to the courtyard, he sensed a\nchange in the noises from within. Shrill, angry voices had replaced the\ncheerful murmur of general conversation.\n\nThe donkey and the boy who had ridden it huddled in the corner where the\nstables met the main building.\n\nDaoud stood listening in the center of the inn yard, his hand resting\nlightly on the dagger at his belt. He faced the two-story main building,\nthe dining hall at ground level, the beds that slept six or more\nupstairs. Access to the sleeping room was by way of a flight of outside\nwooden stairs leading to a platform and an upper door. The doors and the\nwindow shutters on both levels were open to let in the cool night air.\nStables secured with half doors on his left, a storage shed on his\nright.\n\nAs Daoud strode past the old man's son, he caught a glimpse of bright\nblack eyes reflecting the light from oil lanterns hung on wooden pegs\nset high on either side of the inn door.\n\nDaoud moved to the doorway, and as he looked into the smoky, candlelit\nhall, his heart sank.\n\nThe crowd of men and women in the room were turned toward Lorenzo\nCelino. He stood against the far wall, the long blade of his sword\ngleaming in the candlelight, facing six naked daggers.\n\nBeside Celino, the hound Scipio stood stiff-legged, tail whipping from\nside to side, fangs bared, growling softly. Fear of that dog was keeping\nCelino's opponents back as much as fear of his sword, thought Daoud.\n\nThe bearded old man who had spoken to Daoud was standing to Celino's\nleft and a little behind him. Celino's eyes flicked toward Daoud for an\ninstant, and then quickly away before anyone might notice that he had\nlooked toward the doorway.\n\nDaoud scanned the room for Sophia. She was standing in the shadows,\nalmost invisible in a long, hooded cloak. No one was threatening her.\n\nOne of the men facing Celino, Daoud recognized, was the innkeeper\nhimself. He was a huge man with broad, rounded shoulders and a shock of\nthick black hair cut off at the same length all the way around, so it\nlooked like a bowl. The dagger he held was a long, murderous blade, but\nhis big hand made it look like a toy.\n\n\"Give us the Jew,\" the innkeeper said to Celino. \"We have no quarrel\nwith you.\"\n\nThe old man was a Jew? How was it, Daoud demanded of himself, that these\npeople had known that and he had not?\n\n\"You do have a quarrel with me,\" said Celino, \"because I do not care to\nsee you torment and rob this old man.\"\n\nDaoud swore to himself. Was this the kind of madman Manfred had yoked\nhim with? Sworn to the utmost secrecy, carrying a fortune in jewels, and\nnow he brings a whole inn down around his ears by defending some dusty\nold man?\n\n_But does not God love the compassionate?_\n\n_Give us the Jew_, the innkeeper had said. Daoud knew that Christians\ntook delight in mistreating Jews.\n\n_And I told the old man to go in there. But I did not know he was a Jew.\nOr that these people would harm him._\n\nWhether Celino was a madman or not, Daoud would have to get him out of\nthis, because he was carrying half of their supply of precious stones.\nWhen they left Lucera, Daoud and Celino had divided the twenty-four\njewels Manfred had traded for the great emerald. Each carried half of\nthe precious stones in a pouch hidden under his tunic.\n\nDaoud studied the room. There must be a good thirty people there, most\nof them men. Aside from the six surrounding Celino, few of them seemed\nmenacing. But if someone jumped in to help Celino, more might join the\nother side.\n\n_What do I have to help me? That boy who came with the old man. Sophia.\nAnd Celino and the dog._\n\nIf only, he thought, he had the Scorpion. But that was in the dining\nhall there, with all their other baggage, which Celino--the fool!--was\nsupposed to be guarding.\n\nHe backed out into the small courtyard and bumped into the boy, who had\nfollowed him to the door. \"You. Your father is in danger in there. And\nmy friend has gotten into trouble trying to help him. We must get them\nout, you and I.\"\n\n\"Why should Christians help us?\" The bitter voice was high. The boy must\nbe very young. He was wrapped up like a Bedouin. His head and face were\nswathed in a dark cloth, his body cloaked. Only those sparkling eyes\nshowed.\n\n\"I must help my friend,\" Daoud said. \"If he lives, you can ask him why\nhe chose to defend your father. Are you just going to cower here?\"\n\n\"What should I do?\"\n\nWhat would make those men leave Celino alone long enough to give him a\nchance to escape? Standing outside the doorway with the boy, Daoud's\neyes searched the courtyard again as his mind tried to fit what he saw\ninto a plan.\n\nDaoud looked up at the lanterns again. Fire was sure to take men's minds\noff a fight.\n\n\"Take the lanterns and run up those stairs. Throw them into the bedding\nand get a good fire going. Make sure the floor is burning. Then come\nback down to me.\"\n\nDaoud took the two lanterns down from their pegs and handed them to the\nboy, who raced up the stairs that clung to the outer wall of the inn.\nDaoud went to the stable and opened the doors of the stalls that held\ntheir four horses. He dragged out the saddles and bridles and threw them\nover the horses' backs. Trained with horses since boyhood, he worked\nwith practiced speed. By the time the boy was beside him again, he had\ntwo of the horses saddled.\n\nHe looked up and saw bright yellow flames flickering in the upper\nwindows.\n\n\"You did that well,\" he said. \"You know how to saddle horses?\"\n\n\"Yes, Messere.\"\n\n\"Get these two ready, then. Do it right; you will be riding one. And\nhold them here with your donkey.\"\n\nDaoud turned and shouted, \"Fire!\"\n\nHe ran to the doorway, looked in long enough to see the darkened spot\nwith its glowing center in the wooden ceiling of the dining hall, and\ngestured toward it as he again shouted, \"Fire!\" Then he stepped back to\nlet the crowd tumble out past him.\n\nThe burly innkeeper was among the first to exit, jamming his dagger back\ninto its scabbard and shouting for help. \"Take water from the horse\ntrough. Get buckets, pots, anything!\" Waving his long arms, he towered\nover the men milling around him like a giant commanding an army of\ndwarves.\n\nWhen the first rush had pushed through the doorway, Daoud ran into the\ndining hall. He could see the blackening circle spreading in the ceiling\nand flames licking around its edges.\n\nCelino and the old Jew were still standing together by the far wall.\nOnly three men faced them now.\n\n\"Come on!\" Daoud shouted. He strode to the table where they had been\nsitting and grabbed up their packs.\n\n\"Stay where you are!\" a woman's voice cried. It was the innkeeper's\nwife, a gaunt woman nearly as tall as her husband, with bulging eyes and\na face as sharp as the carving knife she brandished.\n\nAn earthenware jug crashed down on her head. Her eyes rolled up till\nonly the whites showed. As she slumped to the floor, Daoud saw Sophia\nbehind her.\n\n_Well done, Byzantine woman._\n\n\"Scipio! Spegni!\" Celino shouted. With a roar like a lion's, Scipio\nleapt at the central figure among the three men confronting his master.\nScipio's prey screamed, then stumbled over a bench and fell to the floor\non his back. The hound sprang onto his chest, snarls of rage all but\ndrowning out his victim's shrieks. The other two men, their mouths\ngaping, their eyes fixed on nothing, ran past Daoud without seeing him.\n\n\"Stop your dog,\" Daoud called to Celino. \"I want no killing.\" Smoke\nspreading from above was searing his nostrils.\n\nDaoud, Celino, and Sophia, followed by the old man and the dog, made\ntheir way to the door.\n\nDaoud threw saddlebags to Celino and Sophia. Men were dragging their\npanic-stricken, rearing horses out of the stables and through the gate.\nThe giant innkeeper and other men were racing up and down the outside\nstairs, which had also begun to burn, dumping buckets of water on the\nfire. Men were fighting their way through smoke and flame into the\nbedroom, trying to rescue belongings they had left there.\n\nThe boy stood by their horses, exactly where Daoud had left him. Bravely\ndone, Daoud thought. Hastily tying his packs down, Daoud unlaced one.\nThere were two weapons inside--a Scorpion, the miniature crossbow of the\nHashishiyya, and a full-size crossbow. Daoud chose the bigger one, a\nGenoese arbalest drawn by crank, a present from King Manfred. The\nquarrels were loaded by spring from a chamber within the stock that\ncould hold six at a time, so that the bowman could fire it as quickly as\nhe could draw it.\n\nHolding the arbalest with one hand, Daoud vaulted into the saddle.\nCelino and Sophia were already up. The old man had clambered onto their\nspare horse, and his son was on the donkey.\n\n_I should leave that old man behind_, Daoud thought angrily. _Were it\nnot for him, I would be sleeping comfortably right now._\n\n\"_They_ started the fire!\" It was the innkeeper's wife in the doorway,\nher tall body and long arms silhouetted by leaping flames. She pointed\nan accusing hand at Daoud's party. \"Stop them!\"\n\nThe men who had been trying to put out the fire were giving up, and they\nturned and started for Daoud and his companions.\n\n\"Throw them into the fire!\" shrieked the woman in the doorway.\n\nMotioning the others toward the gate, Daoud turned his horse sideways\nand swung the crossbow in an arc to cover the attackers. The men stopped\ntheir rush, but the tall woman pushed her way through them, screaming\ncurses.\n\nHer hulking husband joined her, his long arms reaching for Daoud. He\nlooked able to knock a horse to the ground.\n\nDaoud used both hands to aim the crossbow at him, gripping the horse\nwith his knees. He hoped the threat would be enough to stop the man. He\ndid not want to shoot the innkeeper. If anyone were killed, the deed\ncould follow them to Orvieto.\n\nAs he hesitated, the huge man drew back his arm and threw the dagger\nwith the force of a catapult. Daoud heard a thump and a groan behind\nhim. Daoud's thumb pressed the crossbow's release, and the string\nsnapped forward with a reverberating bang. The innkeeper bellowed with\npain, the cry dying away as he collapsed. The bolt probably went right\nthrough him, thought Daoud.\n\nAs the man's dying groan faded, his wife's scream rose. She fell on her\nknees beside him, and the other men crowded around them.\n\n\"Blood of Jesus! Pandolfo!\" the innkeeper's wife wailed.\n\nJerking the reins with his left hand, Daoud wheeled the horse out the\ngate.\n\n_God help us, now they will be after us._\n\nWhich one of his people had been hurt?\n\nHe found himself, in his anger, hoping it was Celino.\n\nThe three other horses and the donkey were bunched together outside the\ngate, on the dirt path that led through trees to the Appian Way. Some of\nthe men from the inn were out there, too, but when Daoud swung the\ncrossbow in their direction, they backed into the inn yard.\n\n\"Leave me here,\" the old man gasped. \"I am dying.\" So it was he the\ndagger had hit. They would have to leave him, Daoud thought, and his son\nwould insist on staying with him. And the vengeful crowd from the inn\nwould tear the two of them to pieces. All this fighting would have been\nfor nothing.\n\nCelino spurred his horse over to where the old man swayed in the saddle\nclutching his stomach. \"Sorry to hurt you, but we are not leaving you,\"\nhe said. He pulled the groaning wounded man across to his own horse and\nswung one of his legs over so that he was riding astride.\n\nDaoud saw blood, black in the faint light of the crescent moon, running\nout of the old man's mouth, staining his white beard.\n\n\"Can you ride a horse?\" Celino barked at the son.\n\n\"Yes,\" the boy sobbed.\n\n\"Get up on this one.\" Celino indicated the horse from which he had just\ndragged the old man. \"Take your packs off the donkey and put them on\nthis horse if you want them. Quickly, quickly. Leave the donkey.\"\n\nDaoud fingered the crossbow as the boy hastily transferred himself and\nhis goods to the horse.\n\n_Still Celino risks our lives with his care for these strangers. Damned\ninfidel. I am the leader of this party._\n\n\"Here they come!\" cried Sophia. Waving swords and long-handled\nhalberds--God knew where they had gotten them--and sticks and\npitchforks, the crowd from the inn tumbled through the gate. Some of\nthem were on horses.\n\n\"Ride!\" shouted Daoud in the voice he used to command his Mameluke\ntroop.\n\nHe kicked his spurs into his horse's side and sent it galloping down the\nroad.\n\nHe and Celino had not talked about which way to flee, but there was\nreally only one direction they could go--north, toward their\ndestination. That, he knew, would take them straight into the heart of\nRome.\n\nThere would be a price to pay for the blood they had shed this night.\n\nThe great Salah ad-Din had said it:\n\n_Blood never sleeps._\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\nThe clatter of four horses' hooves over the broken paving stones of the\nAppian Way rang in Daoud's ears. He heard shouts behind him as the men\nfrom the Ox's Head organized a pursuit. And beside him the old man, held\nerect by Celino's powerful arm, groaned again and again as the wild ride\njolted his stomach wound. His legs dangled lifelessly on either side of\nthe horse.\n\nDaoud looked over his shoulder and saw that the boy was keeping up,\nriding next to Celino. His robes were hiked up and his skinny, bare legs\ngleamed in the faint moonlight. Daoud could hear him sobbing loudly, in\ntime with his father's groans, as the horses pounded onward.\n\nGlancing over at Sophia, on his right, he saw that she was stiff in the\nsaddle, like one not used to riding, and the moonlight showed her lips\ntight and her jaw clenched. But she rode hard and made no complaint. She\nsat astride, wearing trousers under a divided skirt. Daoud felt himself\nadmiring her. So far the woman had proved no burden. Celino had caused\ntrouble, but not she.\n\nGlancing quickly again at her profile, outlined by moonlight, he\nrealized with a start that she reminded him of a face he had not seen in\nmany years. Nicetas. She had the same high forehead and long, straight\nnose. Her mouth was fuller, but her lips had the chiseled shape of\nNicetas's lips. Nicetas. Even amid this moment's perils sorrow gripped\nhis heart for the one who was lost and could never be recovered.\n\nAs if she sensed him looking at her, Sophia turned her face toward him,\nbut this put her face in shadow, and he could not make out her\nexpression. He shrugged and looked away.\n\nHe rode with one hand holding the arbalest across the saddle in front of\nhim, the other on the reins, guiding his mount. The horses Manfred had\ngiven them ran well, aided a little by the high crescent moon. Daoud\ntried to maneuver his small party to skirt dark patches in the road\nwhere there might be holes in the pavement that could trip them.\n\nThe cries of the pursuers were louder, and Daoud heard hoofbeats behind\nthem. He looked back and saw a dark cluster of horsemen rushing down the\nroad. Five or six men, he guessed. There could not have been many more\nhorses than that stabled at the inn.\n\nHe felt no fear for himself. The country might be strange to him, but\nriding and fighting in darkness were not. But his stomach tensed with\nworry about the four people with him. One of them was already badly\nhurt. Could he get them away safely? They were in his care now, and it\nwas a duty.\n\nCelino was the only one of his charges who could look out for himself.\nAnd he, thought Daoud angrily, was the one who had least deserved to\nsurvive.\n\n_But he is carrying half the accursed jewels._\n\n_If we survive this, it might be best for me to kill Celino._\n\nAs they rode on, Daoud kept glancing over his shoulder. Their pursuers\nwere gaining on them. Celino's horse, carrying two riders, was holding\nDaoud's party back. But that meant the men from the inn would soon be\nwithin the arbalest's short range. He had only three bolts left in the\nbox under the stock. He wished he had a heavy Turkish bow, the kind he\nhad used at the battle of the Well of Goliath. Almost as powerful as a\ncrossbow, it was easier to handle on horseback and would shoot much\nfarther.\n\n_Now they will see how Mamelukes fight._\n\nHis eyes were now completely adjusted to the faint moonlight. The road\ntook them into a deep pine wood. They splashed through a puddle in a low\nplace, then clambered up a slope.\n\nDown the other side. At the bottom of the next slope, Daoud twisted\naround in the saddle. Letting go of the reins and guiding the horse with\nhis knees, he aimed the crossbow at the top of the hill. When the first\nrider came over the crest, clearly visible in the moonlight, Daoud\npressed the catch with his thumb and released the bolt. An instant later\nthe man fell without a sound.\n\nHe told himself a warrior of God should not rejoice at the death of an\nenemy, but he could not help a small surge of satisfaction at his good\nshooting.\n\nDaoud cranked the string back and another bolt snapped into place. He\nhit the next man on the downslope. It was a harder shot, and this man\ndid not die instantly but toppled screaming out of the saddle.\n\nAfter glancing forward to make sure of the road ahead, Daoud turned\nagain and saw that the three remaining men had stopped, their horses\nmilling around the fallen men. They would give up pursuit now, Daoud was\nsure of it. Doubtless none of them had any real weapons, and they could\nnot contend with a crossbow.\n\nHe felt his lips stretch in a grin, and he sighed deeply with relief. He\nhad been more worried than he realized.\n\nHe and his companions topped another hill, and when he looked back again\ntheir pursuers had disappeared below its crest.\n\nDaoud raised his hand and called out, \"Slow down to a trot. No one seems\nto be following us. We can be easier on the old man and the horses.\"\n\n\"And on Scipio,\" Celino said, pointing down to a great shadow racing\nwith them along the side of the road. Daoud could hear the hound panting\nand his claws drumming on the paving stones. He wondered how long Scipio\ncould keep up with galloping horses, then reminded himself that this was\na hunting dog. Scipio could probably outrun horses.\n\n\"Soon the Appian Way will take us to the old walls of Rome,\" said\nCelino. \"The watchmen there would question us. But we can go off to the\nleft toward the Tiber and skirt the city.\"\n\n_And because Celino knows such things, I cannot kill him. But I must see\nto it that he never again does anything like this to endanger us._\n\nAs they rode on, Daoud realized that the old man had stopped moaning. He\nheard Celino whispering something that sounded like a prayer.\n\n\"How fares the old man?\"\n\nCelino sounded angry. \"He's dead.\"\n\nOn the other side of Celino the boy let out a wail of anguish, and then\nsobbed bitterly. Daoud felt a surge of grief. He was not sure whether it\nwas for the boy or for himself.\n\n\"We should leave his body behind,\" he said to Celino. \"Going this fast,\nthat horse cannot carry both of you much farther.\" Anger at all this\nuseless trouble constricted his throat and made his voice husky.\n\nThe boy cried, \"No!\" It was almost a scream.\n\n\"I can manage,\" said Celino.\n\n\"I will not leave him!\" the boy shouted.\n\nSophia whispered, \"I wish we had never seen them--without our help, they\nmight only have been robbed. That poor boy!\"\n\nCelino clenched his fist and muttered to himself. Then he looked up and\nmotioned to Daoud, pointing out a road diverging westward from the\nAppian Way. Daoud jerked the reins of his horse, and the hooves no\nlonger rang on old Roman paving stones but thudded on hard-packed dirt.\nThe trees closed together overhead, and they rode for a time in almost\ntotal darkness.\n\nCelino dropped back now, and Daoud, glancing over his shoulder a little\nlater, saw the boy and Celino in conversation as they rode side by side.\nAfter they had gone a mile or so, Celino rode back to join Daoud and\nSophia. The old man's body was draped over his horse's back in front of\nhim.\n\n\"You have much to answer to me for,\" Daoud said.\n\n\"I know that,\" said Celino. \"But as long as we are out of Rome by\nmorning, we are safe. The Giudecca, the Jewish quarter, is along the\nTiber on the south side of the city. We can leave the boy with them and\nthey will help him bury his father and take him in. It is not far from\nhere.\" Daoud could not see his face clearly in the dark, but there was a\nnote of pleading in his tone.\n\n\"How far?\" Daoud demanded.\n\n\"We will be there long before dawn.\"\n\n\"But then we will have to go into the city,\" Daoud said. \"How do we\nexplain to the Roman watchmen why we are carrying an old man, dead of a\nknife wound? Surely they will be at least as thorough in inspecting\nbaggage as you were at Lucera.\"\n\nCelino was silent a moment. \"You two can cross a bridge that will take\nyou west of the city. I will take the old man's body and the boy to the\nGiudecca, and I will be the only one who will have to deal with the\nwatch.\"\n\nSophia spoke up. \"As you dealt with those ruffians at the inn? Then we\nwill have all of Rome hunting us.\"\n\n\"All of Rome?\" Celino chuckled. \"The Romans can agree on only one\nthing--fighting among themselves. There are powerful Ghibellino families\nhere who will protect us if need be.\"\n\nHe needed this damned Lorenzo, Daoud thought, because of his connections\nwith the Ghibellini.\n\n\"How did the men at the inn know the old man was a Jew?\" Daoud asked\nCelino.\n\n\"The hat he was wearing,\" Celino said. \"All Jews are required to wear\nthose round black hats in the Papal States. To make it easier for good\nChristians to persecute them.\" Daoud shook his head. Even Christians\nwere treated better than that in al-Islam.\n\n_I did not know. Somehow, out of all that I learned about the Christian\nworld, that detail about hats for Jews was left out. A little thing, too\ntrivial to be mentioned. What other deadly little omissions lie in wait\nfor me?_\n\nHe felt like a man in chains. He would have to keep Celino with him, and\nthe prospect infuriated him.\n\nAs they continued riding westward, Daoud heard the boy weeping. It made\nhim think of nights in the Mameluke barracks on Raudha Island when he\nlay on his pallet, biting his knuckles so no one would hear him sob as\nhe cried for his mother and father and for himself so lost and lonely.\n\n_I will help the boy bury his father. If it does not endanger us._\n\nThis boy, too, was lost and lonely. As Daoud had been while training to\nbe a Mameluke.\n\nAs Nicetas had been.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt had been a chilly day, the day that Daoud and Nicetas became friends.\n\nHuge gray clouds billowed in the east, over the Sinai desert. In the lee\nof a cliff formed of giant blocks of red sandstone, a dozen small tents\nclustered.\n\nOn a restless brown pony with a barrel-shaped body, Daoud waited in a\nline of nearly thirty julbans, Mamelukes in training, similarly mounted.\nSoon it would be his turn to ride past the wooden ring that a pair of\nslaves was swinging from side to side between the legs of a scaffold. In\nhis hand Daoud grasped a rumh, a lightweight lance longer than a man's\nbody, with a tip of sharpened bone.\n\nOn a low rise of brown gravel, Mahmoud, the Circassian naqeeb in charge\nof their training troop, sat astride a sleek brown Arab half blood. He\nlooked almost regal in his long scarlet kaftan and reddish-brown fur\ncap. His beard was full and gray, and a necklace of gold coins hung down\nto his waist. The boys wore round caps of undyed cotton cloth and\nstriped robes, and they rode scrubby ponies.\n\nFrom atop a galloping horse, each boy was expected to hurl his rumh\nunerringly through the ring, whose diameter was two handspans. The ring\nwas attached to three strong, slender ropes. One rope suspended it from\nthe scaffold; the other two went out to either side, where the slaves\nheld them. Pulling in turn on the ropes, the two slaves swung the ring\nfrom side to side.\n\nThe boy just ahead of Daoud in line was a new member of the troop of\nyoung Mamelukes. His face was smooth and his skin pale, his hair and\neyes very black.\n\nHe turned to Daoud and said, \"What if we hit one of those slaves by\nmistake?\"\n\nDaoud had once seen a slave transfixed by a wild cast of the rumh. It\nhurt to remember his screams and thrashings.\n\n\"Wound a slave and you will be beaten,\" he said. \"Kill a slave, and you\ngo without water for three days. In this desert that is a death\nsentence.\"\n\nThe boy whistled and shrugged. \"Hard punishments for us, but not much\ncomfort to the slaves, I'd say.\"\n\n\"It comforts them to know we have reason to be careful,\" Daoud answered.\n\nAfter a moment, the boy smiled hesitantly and said, \"I am Nicetas. From\nTrebizond. Where are you from?\"\n\nDaoud rubbed his pony's neck to settle it down. \"Ascalon, not far from\nhere. I am called Daoud.\" He saw the puzzlement in Nicetas's face and\nadded, \"My parents were Franks.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Nicetas, and looked sympathetic, as if he had instantly\ngrasped what had happened to Daoud's mother and father and how he came\nto be a Mameluke.\n\n\"My mother was a whore,\" Nicetas said without any sign of embarrassment.\n\"She sold me to the Turks when I was eight, and I was glad to go. She\nhad sold me for other things before that. This is a good life. You learn\nto ride and shoot. Mamelukes wear gold, and they lord it over everybody\nelse.\"\n\nDaoud felt a slight easing of the tension of waiting to cast the rumh.\nHe enjoyed talking to this new boy. There was a warmth and liveliness in\nhim that Daoud liked. And even though their lives had been different,\nDaoud felt more of a kinship with this boy than he ever had with any of\nthe others in his training group.\n\n\"Mamelukes have a good life if they live,\" said Daoud. \"Where is\nTrebizond?\"\n\nNicetas waved his left hand. \"North of here. It is a Greek city on the\nBlack Sea. But I suppose you have never heard of the Black Sea.\"\n\n\"I know where the Black Sea is,\" said Daoud, somewhat annoyed that\nNicetas should think him totally ignorant. \"How did you come to join our\norta?\"\n\n\"I was enrolled in the Fakri, the Mamelukes of Emir Fakr ad-Din. The\nemir was killed by the Frankish invaders last year. The older Fakri are\nstaying together, but the young ones have been transferred out to the\nother ortas.\"\n\nDaoud found himself feeling somewhat sorry for Nicetas. He knew how\nlonely the Greek boy must be. His khushdashiya, his barracks comrades,\nwere the nearest he had to a family. And even at that he was not really\nclose to the other boys. He was the only Frank among them, and to talk\nto them at all he had to learn their various languages--Turkish, Kurd,\nFarsi, Circassian, Tartar. They would not bother to learn the Norman\nFrench, which was still the language he heard in his dreams. Most of the\nboys slept two by two in the field, but Daoud had no close friend to\nshare a tent with.\n\n\"Go!\" shouted Mahmoud the Circassian to Nicetas.\n\nThe Greek boy stood up in the saddle, and rode down the field with a\nwarbling scream that was a perfect imitation of a Bedouin war cry. His\ntrousers billowed against his long legs. Daoud watched his handsome,\nstraight-nosed profile as he turned to fix his eyes on the swinging\ntarget. The lean-muscled bare arm drew back and snapped forward. The\nlong black pole of the rumh whistled through the air, shot smoothly\nthrough the ring and landed upright, quivering, in the dune beyond it.\n\nDaoud heard murmurs of appreciation around him. At the naqeeb's next cry\nof, \"Go!\" Daoud kicked his pony in the ribs and plunged forward to try\nhis own cast.\n\nHe tried to ignore the fear of missing that knotted his belly muscles,\ntried not to think at all about his desperate need to make a good cast.\n\nHe guided his mount with the pressure of his knees. He squinted his eyes\nagainst the wind of his rush and fixed them on the ring. His body moved\nup and down with the action of the horse, and the ring swung back and\nforth. He twisted sideways in the saddle, steadying himself with one\nhand on the pony's back. Grasping the rumh at the middle so that it\nbalanced, he lifted it high over his head. The little horse's muscles\nrippled under his palm. If he fixed his gaze and his aim on the point in\nspace that the ring occupied at the lowest point of its arc, and\nreleased his rumh just as the ring reached the extremity of its swing,\nthe target and rumh should arrive together.\n\nThe pony had carried him opposite the ring now, and he took a deep\nbreath and whipped his arm forward.\n\nHis lance reached the right spot--an instant too late. He wanted to\nthrow himself down from his horse and weep with frustration.\n\nHe heard groans and curses from behind him. Not once this morning had\nthe troop had a perfect round. He rode around to the back of the\nscaffold, where the two slaves were sitting until the next boy should\ntake his turn. The ghulmans kept their eyes down, their black faces\nexpressionless. Angrily he yanked his rumh out of the sand and rode back\nto the end of the line.\n\nNicetas patted his arm reassuringly. Two more boys missed after Daoud,\nand that also made him feel a bit better. It occurred to Daoud that\nNicetas was one of the few who had not once missed the ring that\nmorning. He was a good horseman and seemed to have a remarkably keen eye\nwith the rumh.\n\nThe only other boy in the troop who was that good, Daoud thought, was\nKassar, the Kipchaq Tartar. Daoud looked around for Kassar and saw him\nsitting on his pony partway out of line, eyeing Nicetas sourly. Kassar's\nhead was round, his face flat, and he was already old enough to have\ngrown a small black mustache.\n\n\"From now on,\" the naqeeb bellowed from his hilltop, \"anyone who misses\nonce will not eat today. Anyone who misses twice will sleep in the\ndesert tonight without tent or blankets.\"\n\nNicetas, who was wearing a long, sleeveless robe, grinned and shook\nhimself. \"It will be cold out there tonight.\"\n\n\"What if someone misses a third time, naqeeb?\" someone called out.\n\n\"He is no longer Mameluke,\" said Mahmoud in a soft voice that carried.\n\"He goes back to El Kahira. To be a ghulman for the rest of his life.\"\n\nHe would kill himself first, Daoud thought. He would plunge his dagger\ninto his own heart before he would let that happen to him.\n\nA frozen silence fell over the troop. The only sound Daoud could hear\nwas the desert wind hissing past his ears. But he felt the fear all\naround him just as he felt the wind.\n\nMahmoud's threat seemed to help the troop's marksmanship. Only one boy\nmissed in the next round. In that round and the one that followed,\nDaoud's rumh flew true both times. The second time, he felt dizzy with\nrelief, and he leaned forward and hugged his horse's neck as he rode\nback to his place.\n\nOne more round and they could rest. Daoud's body ached, especially his\nback and his arms. He felt a clenching in his stomach, knowing that he\nhad to get his lance through the ring this time. His khushdashiya would\nhate him, and he would hate himself, if he missed. And the more he\nfeared missing, the more he would be likely to miss.\n\n\"Never mind hitting a slave,\" said Nicetas just before his turn. \"Do us\nall a favor, hit the naqeeb.\"\n\nDaoud laughed. Nicetas rode out and hit the target as usual. Feeling\nless tense, Daoud rode out to make his third cast. He held his breath\nuntil he saw his long lance sail smoothly through the dark-rimmed\ncircle.\n\nHe shouted with joy and turned his mount back toward the troop. He did\nnot hug his horse this time. Laughing, he rode up beside Nicetas, threw\nhis arms around him, and pulled the skinny body against his larger\nframe. Nicetas's eyes seemed to sparkle as they looked into his when\nDaoud let him go.\n\nIt turned out to be another perfect round, and Mahmoud declared they\ncould stop to pray and eat.\n\n_Thank God!_ Daoud said fervently to himself.\n\nThe sun had crossed from the zenith to the western part of the sky.\nMahmoud led them in reciting the prayers, facing south toward Mecca.\nThen each julban took a portion of stale bread and dry goat cheese from\na pouch hanging from his saddle, and a single draft from his water skin.\nThe swallow of warm water Daoud took tasted foul, but he had to fight\ndown the impulse to drink more. He sat down before his small tent to\neat.\n\n\"May I sit with you?\" Daoud squinted up into the sun to see the Greek\nboy standing over him.\n\n\"Please,\" said Daoud, gesturing to the sand beside him.\n\nThey ate in silence for a time. Daoud looked up from the hard bread he\nwas relentlessly chewing and saw Nicetas smiling at him. He smiled back.\n\n\"You were eating by yourself,\" Nicetas said. \"Do you sleep alone, too?\"\nDaoud nodded.\n\n\"Would you like to have a tent mate?\"\n\nBefore Daoud could answer, a shadow fell over them. Daoud looked up.\nKassar stood between them and the sun, half a dozen of his friends\naround him. He glowered down at Nicetas.\n\n\"You think you are good?\"\n\nNicetas's smile was friendly. \"It is in the blood. Greeks are good at\ngames.\"\n\n\"You throw like a girl,\" Kassar said to Nicetas. The Kipchaq's followers\nlaughed dutifully.\n\nDaoud felt his face burn with anger. He wanted to say something on\nNicetas's behalf, even though it was the rule that each boy must defend\nhimself.\n\nNicetas, still smiling pleasantly and looking quite unafraid, stood up\nwith lithe grace to face Kassar.\n\n\"My rumh pierces the target,\" he said, making a circle with thumb and\nforefinger and pushing his other forefinger into it. \"You have to be a\nman to do that.\"\n\nThis time the laughter was spontaneous, but Kassar did not smile.\n\n\"I will bet with you that I can throw the rumh better than you can,\"\nsaid Kassar grimly. \"I will make you a handsome bet. I will put up the\nmail shirt that I took from a Frankish knight at Mansura.\"\n\nDaoud felt the sting of envy. If he had only been a year or two older,\nhe, too, might have souvenirs of that battle.\n\n\"I possess nothing of value,\" said Nicetas. \"What can I put up against\nyour mail shirt?\"\n\nGrinning, Kassar stepped closer to the Greek, bringing his face down\ntill Nicetas's sharp-pointed nose almost touched his flat one. \"You will\nspend the night in my tent whenever I want you.\" His thick fingers\ngripped Nicetas's chin, kneading the flesh of his face.\n\nNicetas blushed and pulled away, rubbing his chin, but still he smiled.\n\"If your hand is that rough, I do not wonder you need a new tent mate.\"\n\nThis time the boys all roared with laughter, and Kassar's eyes narrowed\nto angry slits.\n\nDaoud had never before heard anyone speak openly of what all the boys\nwere aware of but only whispered about. For more than a year Daoud had\nseen and felt his body changing and had been tormented by steadily\ngrowing needs within himself. He sensed that others of his khushdashiya\nwere tormented by the same nearly unbearable hungers. He knew, from\nlistening to the talk of older men, that the answer to all these\nyearnings lay in women. But julbans were forbidden the company of women.\nHe quickly learned how to relieve himself in solitude, and suspected\nmany of the others did the same. But some, he was sure, made use of each\nother's bodies.\n\n\"I accept the contest,\" said Nicetas, staring fearlessly into Kassar's\neyes.\n\n\"We must go to the naqeeb for permission,\" said Kassar. \"But we will not\ntell him the stakes. He might get ideas about you.\" He grinned at\nNicetas with such frank lasciviousness that Daoud, remembering how his\ncaptors had raped him years ago, wanted to smash his fist into the\nTartar's big white teeth.\n\nHe followed Nicetas and Kassar as they went to Mahmoud's large silk tent\nand explained the contest.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mahmoud, leading the way back to the practice field. \"Put\nthe one-handspan ring on, and you will ride fifty paces from the target.\nYou will cast until one of you misses and the other follows with a hit.\nIf both of you miss, you will be beaten for disturbing my rest.\"\n\nThe slaves changed the two-handspan target ring for the smaller one and\nbegan pulling on the guide ropes that swung the ring from side to side.\nThe naqeeb paced off the distance for Kassar and Nicetas.\n\nAt Mahmoud's command, Kassar rode down the field. He made a perfect\ncast, and his friends cheered. It was Nicetas's turn, and he flew past\nthe target with his warbling scream, standing in the stirrups. There was\nsomething dance-like in the way he stood swaying with the jolting\nmovement of his pony, left arm outstretched to balance himself, rumh\npoised to throw.\n\n_He is beautiful_, Daoud thought.\n\nNicetas's rumh went perfectly through the ring. The cheer for him was\nlower; after all, nobody knew him.\n\nDaoud called out, \"God guides your arm, Nicetas!\" Some of the other boys\nstared at him, and his face grew hot.\n\nBoth contestants made successful second casts. But when Kassar made his\nthird throw, Daoud saw the ring wobble slightly. The rumh must have\nbrushed its inner edge. Nicetas's third try, once again, was flawless.\n\n\"We cannot be at this till sunset,\" Mahmoud grumbled. \"Move out to\nseventy paces.\" He paced off the new distance, and Kassar and Nicetas,\nstone-faced, not looking at each other, rode to the spot he pointed out.\n\nTo throw the rumh accurately from that distance would take great\nstrength as well as a keen eye, Daoud thought. Looking at Nicetas's\nslender arms and narrow shoulders, he wondered if the Greek boy could\nmanage it.\n\nA wind rose, stinging Daoud's face with tiny sand particles. It was\nblowing from the east, across the field where the boys rode. Nicetas\nwould be lucky to get his lance anywhere near the scaffold.\n\nAt Mahmoud's barking command, Kassar galloped out across the field. He\nhalf rose as he came abreast of the target, and Daoud saw his powerful\nshoulder muscles bunch under his thin robe.\n\nThere was a loud crack as Kassar's rumh hit the ring. Daoud saw black\nfragments fly though the air. He gasped in surprise.\n\nKassar's lance had hit the side of the target ring, and the desert-dried\nwood had shattered under the impact.\n\n\"Well.\" Mahmoud turned to Nicetas with a laugh. \"The target is\ndestroyed.\"\n\n\"Let us put another ring on,\" said Nicetas promptly, just as Kassar rode\nup.\n\nKassar's face was tight with fury. \"The rings are different sizes. It\nwill not be fair if you have a bigger ring to hit.\"\n\n\"I want a smaller ring,\" said Nicetas with a faint smile.\n\nMahmoud sent a boy galloping to the target pullers with the order to\nattach a new ring to the ropes. From where he stood, Daoud could not\neven see daylight through the new ring. In the distance he saw a\nwhirlwind raising a cone of sand, a sand devil, spinning near the red\ncliff.\n\n\"Think that there is a crusader charging at you, and you have to hit him\nin the eye to stop him,\" Mahmoud suggested to Nicetas.\n\n\"If it were, I would not let him get close enough for me to _see_ his\neye,\" said Nicetas dryly.\n\n\"Go!\" Mahmoud roared.\n\nNicetas screamed across the field. The rumh flew.\n\nDaoud cried out in amazement as the lance, no bigger than a splinter at\nthis distance, shot perfectly through the ring.\n\nJoy was a white light momentarily blinding Daoud. His heart was beating\nas hard and fast as if it had been he who had made the cast.\n\n\"Nicetas! Yah, Nicetas!\" he cheered.\n\nLoud cries of admiration went up. Nicetas retrieved his rumh and waved\nit over his head, standing in the stirrups as he rode back to the troop.\n\nHe jumped down from his horse, and Kassar, already dismounted, went to\nmeet him. Kassar's heavy walk, his clenched fists, the rage in his face,\ntold Daoud there was going to be trouble.\n\nHe felt hot anger surging up inside him, but he reminded himself again\nthat Nicetas must fight his own battles.\n\nThe boys surrounded Kassar and Nicetas, the naqeeb with his green turban\nin their midst. Daoud pushed himself into the innermost circle.\n\n\"Bring me the mail shirt,\" said Nicetas.\n\n\"_I_ won,\" Kassar declared, glowering down at him. \"I smashed the ring,\na thing you are too weak to do.\" He looked away from Nicetas and moved\nhis head from side to side, glaring around the circle of boys,\nchallenging any of them to contradict him. No one spoke. No one wanted\nto quarrel with Kassar, especially on behalf of a boy no one knew.\n\nDaoud felt angry words rushing up inside him, but he kept himself in\ncheck. To take up Nicetas's quarrel unasked would insult Nicetas. If\nthings got too far out of hand, the naqeeb would intervene.\n\nDaoud felt himself abruptly pushed to one side. He turned to protest,\nand then checked himself. It was Mahmoud, leaving the circle that\nsurrounded Nicetas and Kassar. As Daoud watched in amazement, the\ngray-bearded naqeeb walked to his red-and-white-striped tent and sat\ndown cross-legged on the carpet in front of it, calmly gazing at the\nsandstone cliffs as if what was going on did not concern him at all.\n\n_He should be the one to declare Nicetas the winner_, Daoud thought, as\nangry now as he was astonished. _Is he, too, afraid of Kassar?_\n\n\"When you broke the ring, that was a miss,\" said Nicetas. \"You lost. The\nshirt is mine.\"\n\n\"You will have to take it from me,\" said Kassar with a grin. \"Come to my\ntent and you can wrestle me for it.\" Now he made the gesture encircling\nhis forefinger that Nicetas had made before.\n\nWhat would Nicetas do, Daoud wondered. He was not big enough to hurt\nKassar--but if he yielded, Kassar would make a slave of him and subject\nhim to abominations.\n\n\"I had heard that a Tartar never goes back on his word,\" said Nicetas.\n\"I see now that at least one Tartar is a lying jackal.\"\n\n_Good!_ Daoud thought fiercely. In a battle of insults, he felt sure,\nthe talkative Greek would have the upper hand over the dour Tartar.\n\nKassar reddened, and he smashed his fist into Nicetas's jaw. The Greek\nboy fell to the ground, and Daoud saw that his eyes were blank, dazed.\nBut Nicetas shook his head and forced himself to his feet.\n\n\"Your fist can't restore your honor, Kassar. You have fucked it too many\ntimes.\"\n\nLoud laughter burst out from the watching boys, choked off as again the\nTartar swung, hitting Nicetas in the mouth. The boy was thrown back\nagainst the onlookers, and blood ran from his nose and mouth.\n\nDaoud felt the blood pounding his temples as his anger grew. As long as\nit was just Kassar against Nicetas, he could not get into the fight. But\nif Kassar's friends joined in, he promised himself he would help\nNicetas.\n\n\"Take back what you said,\" Kassar growled, advancing on him.\n\nDaoud could not see Nicetas behind Kassar's bulky form. But suddenly\nKassar's head snapped back and his white cap fell off into the sand. The\nKipchaq fell back, and Daoud saw that Nicetas was on his feet, grinning\nthrough the blood and rubbing his knuckles.\n\n\"Yah, Nicetas!\" he shouted, but he was alone in cheering. He sensed\nothers looking at him. May they burn in the flames if they did not see\nthat Nicetas was the better man.\n\nKassar plowed into Nicetas, pummeling him with both fists. When Nicetas\ncollapsed under the punishment, Kassar kicked him in the head, sending\nhim flying backward. Kassar's friends shouted encouragement. Daoud felt\nhis whole body growing hot with anger.\n\nNicetas rolled over on his stomach, raised himself on hands and knees,\nand spat blood. His eyes searched the crowd of boys watching him and\nKassar, and Daoud knew that he was looking for a friend.\n\n\"Nicetas!\" Daoud cried, and the Greek boy's dazed eyes found him and his\nbloody mouth stretched in a grin.\n\nBut if Nicetas did not give up, Kassar would kill him.\n\nSuddenly Daoud turned and pushed his way through the crowd and hurried\nto where Mahmoud was still sitting.\n\n\"Why do you not stop this?\" he demanded. \"It is your duty to keep order\namong us.\"\n\n\"Do not tell me my duty,\" said Mahmoud. \"Have you forgotten what my cane\nfeels like?\"\n\n\"You would use the cane on _me_?\" Daoud exclaimed, outraged. \"When\nKassar is cheating?\"\n\nThere were a thousand tiny wrinkles around Mahmoud's blue Circassian\neyes, from a lifetime of squinting into the sun.\n\n\"Daoud, I will tell you what my duty is. My duty is to take miserable\njulbans and make Mamelukes of you. When you are a full-fledged Mameluke,\nthere will be no naqeeb over you to right your wrongs. Among Mamelukes,\nhe who is strongest rules. If Kassar is the strongest among you, you\nmust be ruled by him.\"\n\nDaoud growled with disgust and ran back to the fight.\n\nNicetas had somehow gotten back on his feet, though his face was a mass\nof blood and dirt and his breath was coming in gasps. His eyes were\nglazed, but he managed to stagger forward and hit Kassar in the nose\nwith his fist. Blood began to flow from the young Tartar's wide nostrils\ninto his mustache.\n\nKassar put his fingers to his upper lip, took them away and stared at\nthe blood. His eyes widened in fury. His head swung right and left; then\nhe sidestepped to a boy in front of the circle. From the boy's sash he\npulled a dabbus, a fluted iron cylinder mounted on a wooden staff.\n\nSwinging the dabbus so it whistled through the air, Kassar charged at\nNicetas. The boys fell back, opening the circle wider.\n\nFor the first time, Daoud saw fear in Nicetas's eyes. He ducked as\nKassar swung the mace at his head, but his movements were slow and\nawkward. He had been hit too many times. He fell, stood up, and\nstaggered backward.\n\nThe naqeeb would not interfere. This could end only one way.\n\nAnd Daoud knew that he did not want to see Nicetas die before his eyes.\n\nHe would not allow it.\n\nOnly moments ago rage had raised a great storm within him, but now his\nmind was like the desert after the storm has passed, still and empty.\nLike the desert, he felt himself full of a terrible power.\n\nWithout any more thought he stepped out into the ring behind Kassar and\nshouted, \"Kassar! Enough!\"\n\nThe Tartar whirled, holding the dabbus at shoulder height.\n\n\"Stay out of this, pigshit Frank.\"\n\n\"Let him be, Kassar.\" Almost all Daoud's attention was on Kassar, but a\npart of his mind was free to wonder why he felt no fear at all. Somehow,\nhe was not sure how, the hours with Saadi had something to do with it.\n\n\"Put that down,\" Daoud said, pointing at the dabbus.\n\n\"In your head!\" Kassar shouted, and charged at him.\n\nDaoud kept his eyes on Kassar's, but in the edge of his vision he saw\nthe ridged mass of iron, heavy enough to crack a steel helmet, rushing\ntoward his head--his head protected only by a cloth cap.\n\nAt the last possible moment he threw up his hand and caught Kassar's\nwrist. He stepped back out of the path of the dabbus and jerked downward\non Kassar's arm. The weight of the mace helped throw Kassar off balance,\nand he landed on his chest with a grunt, the air driven out of him.\n\nDaoud stamped on Kassar's forearm and yanked the dabbus out of his\ngrasp. He flung himself down on Kassar and pinned him to the sand.\n\nThough all his attention was on Kassar, there was room in his mind for a\ntriumphant surprise.\n\n_Allahu akbar! God is great! I never thought I had the strength to throw\nthe Kipchaq._\n\n\"Nicetas won the contest. Admit it, or I'll break your skull,\" he\ngrowled, holding the dabbus over Kassar's head.\n\nKassar remained silent. Daoud lowered the dabbus and tapped the Tartar's\nround skull through his mop of straight black hair. He hit Kassar just\nhard enough to let him feel the weight of the dabbus.\n\n\"Admit that Nicetas won.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Kassar grunted, his face in the sand. \"He won.\"\n\n\"Swear by the Prophet you will leave him alone from now on.\"\n\n\"I swear,\" came the muffled voice.\n\n\"By the Prophet.\"\n\n\"By the Prophet.\"\n\nDaoud stood up warily and handed the dabbus back to the boy Kassar had\ntaken it from.\n\nKassar rose slowly, wiping sand from his face. His eyes seemed to spark\nwith hatred.\n\n_This is not finished yet_, Daoud thought.\n\nHe looked for Nicetas. The Greek boy was on his feet. He was wiping the\ndirt and blood from his face with the hem of his robe. He looked at\nDaoud, and there was something bright and solemn in his eyes. No one had\never looked at Daoud like that before.\n\nDaoud felt a great rush of gratitude to God for giving him the strength\nto save Nicetas's life.\n\n_If I had not fought Kassar, Nicetas would be dead._\n\nThat clean-lined face so full of warmth and wit would be so much\nlifeless clay. Daoud felt a lightness in his heart and a smile bubbling\nto his lips. He was proud of his strength. He had used it to save a\nprecious life. He was a warrior of God.\n\nSmiling, he went to Nicetas and threw his arm around his shoulders.\n\nHe should force Kassar to give Nicetas the mail shirt. But he had done\nenough fighting for one day. Nicetas did not need the damned shirt. Let\nthe Tartar keep it.\n\n\"Now then, you wretched sons of desert rats!\" came Mahmoud's voice. He\npushed his way into the middle of the ring, coin necklace glittering,\neyes flashing in anger.\n\n\"Fighting, eh? Trying to kill each other? Save your fighting for the\nemir's enemies. You are khushdashiya, brother Mamelukes of Emir Baibars.\nIf again I see one of you raise a hand against his brother, I swear I\nwill stake him out on the sand.\" He raised his right hand to heaven.\n\"Hear me, God!\"\n\nThe naqeeb had a strange way of making Mamelukes out of them, Daoud\nthought. But perhaps he knew what he was doing.\n\nThat night, without anyone's saying any more, Nicetas brought his tent\nand his bedding to Daoud. They compared tents and decided that Daoud's\nwas the larger. They would sleep in it.\n\nAfter they had tended their ponies and joined with the rest of the troop\nin the final prayer of the night, they crawled into the tent and spread\ntheir bedding side by side. Daoud felt Nicetas moving in his half of the\ntent and heard a rustling, as if his new tent mate were shedding his\nclothes. Why would he do that on such a cold night?\n\nNicetas pulled his blankets over both of them and rolled toward Daoud.\nThe Greek boy's skin felt warm and silk-smooth. Nicetas wriggled even\ncloser and stroked Daoud's chest, arousing pleasant tingles. Daoud felt,\nkeener than ever, the powerful longings that had been troubling him. But\nthen he remembered cruel Turkish laughter and rough hands, the\nunbearable pain and shame of his first nights of captivity. He struggled\nto free himself from Nicetas's arms.\n\nAll at once Nicetas let go of him and turned over, leaving a small space\nin the tent between them.\n\n\"Sleep well, Daoud.\" There was hurt in the soft voice.\n\nRemorseful, Daoud reached for his friend. When his hand grasped the bare\nshoulder, his fingers tightened of their own volition. Nicetas drew\ncloser again, until their bodies were pressed together.\n\n\"Ah, Daoud!\" Nicetas whispered.\n\nAfter they had made love, Daoud thought, _Perhaps God sent Nicetas to\nme_.\n\nFearing that the thought might be blasphemous, he put it out of his mind\nand fell into a sated sleep.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDaoud, Sophia, Celino, and the boy came to a riverbank. They had ridden\nin silence for so long that the moon's crescent hung low in the western\nsky, casting a glow on rippling water. Daoud called a halt and sat\ngazing at the Tiber. _Next to the Bhar al-Nil, the river Nile, this is\nthe most famous river in the world._\n\nIt was wide and flowed fast, judging by the ripples, and looked deep.\nLooking upriver, he saw that it followed a winding course leading toward\nblack bulks, lit with yellow lights here and there, that must be great\nbuildings. Rome.\n\nThey laid the old man's body down on a cracked marble platform beside\nthe river. Celino had long since pulled the dagger out of the old man's\nflesh, and now he handed it to Daoud. The dagger was a well-balanced\nthrowing knife of good steel, stained with a film of dried blood. Daoud\nknelt, washed it in the Tiber, and wiped it with the hem of his cloak.\nHe held it out to the boy.\n\n\"I do not want it.\" The boy's face was still wrapped in a blue scarf,\nbut Daoud could see tears glittering on his cheek.\n\n\"It is a good knife. You may have need of it now that you have no\nfather.\"\n\n\"It is the knife that killed him.\" The boy hesitated. \"All right, give\nit to me.\"\n\nDaoud handed it to him, and the boy turned and hurled the knife out over\nthe river. It flew a short distance, and the splash threw off light like\na handful of pearls.\n\n\"Well,\" Daoud said, \"no one had a better right to do that than you.\" He\nsmiled to himself. He could understand quite well the lad's feelings.\n\nBut there was something odd about the way the boy's arm had moved when\nhe threw the knife. Daoud recalled a phrase that he had heard in memory\nwhile they were riding toward the river.\n\n_You throw like a girl._\n\nThat had not been true of Nicetas, but it was true of this boy.\n\nAnd his voice, though high, was not as light and clear as the voice of a\nchild. Moved by a sudden suspicion, Daoud reached out too quickly for\nthe boy to draw away and pulled loose the scarf.\n\nHe leaned closer for a good look. He heard Celino, standing behind him,\ngrunt with surprise. Revealed in the moonlight was, not a lad whose\nvoice had not yet changed, but a girl. Her eyelids were puffy from her\nweeping, but the eyelashes were long and thick, her nose delicate, her\nlips full. The eyes that looked back at him with a mixture of fear and\ndefiance were, in this light, black as obsidian. Her hair was coiled in\na thick braid at the back of her head, where the scarf had hidden it.\n\nHe did not have to ask the reason for the pretense. Traveling with only\nan aged father to protect her, she was far safer as a boy.\n\nSophia pushed past Daoud and put her arms around the girl, who began to\ncry again. \"You poor child, are you all alone now? There, it's all\nright. We will help you.\"\n\n\"Who was your father?\" said Celino in an equally kindly voice.\n\n\"He was not my father,\" the girl whispered. \"He was Angelo Ben Ezra of\nFlorence, a seller of books, and he was my husband.\"\n\nSophia drew back in surprise, then hugged the girl tighter. \"Oh, poor\nlittle one. So young, and wed to such an old man. How could your parents\ndo that to you?\"\n\nThe girl angrily drew back from Sophia. \"Do not speak so! My parents\nwere good to me--and my husband was. He never touched me. When my mother\nand father died of tertian fever, he took me in, and he married me so as\nnot to give scandal. He taught me to read.\"\n\n\"What is your name, girl?\" Celino asked.\n\n\"Rachel.\" She dropped to her knees beside the body stretched out on the\nmarble, and her tears splashed on the white face. She bent over and\nkissed him.\n\n\"He is so cold.\"\n\n\"We must wrap him quickly and be on our way,\" said Daoud. \"We have\nkilled three people and burned down an inn. I assure you, they have\nstopped chasing us only for the moment. Celino, I want a word with you.\nSophia, help the girl wrap her husband's body so we can travel on.\"\n\n\"I do not need to be commanded,\" said Sophia sharply as Daoud turned his\nback on her, motioning Celino to follow him.\n\n_What in the name of God am I to do with these people?_\n\nDaoud strode across the marble platform and picked his way down a flight\nof cracked stairs to the edge of the Tiber. He followed a line of\ntumbled stones, once part of an embankment, until he felt sure Sophia\nand the girl could not hear them.\n\nThen he whirled, bringing his face inches from Celino's.\n\n\"You fool! I ought to kill you for what you have done.\"\n\nHe heard a soft growl to his right.\n\n\"Send your damned dog away,\" he said, without taking his eyes off\nCelino.\n\n\"Of course,\" said Celino calmly. \"Scipio!\" He snapped his fingers. \"To\nthe horses. Go!\"\n\nThe hound turned, head and tail lowered, and walked away. But he swung\nhis long muzzle around to glance back at Daoud as he moved off. His\npupils reflected the moonlight like two silver coins.\n\n\"Give me the jewels you're carrying,\" said Daoud.\n\n\"Of course,\" said Celino again, promptly unbuckling his belt. Daoud\ntensed himself in case the Sicilian should go for his dagger. But Celino\nheld the belt up so that the twelve unset stones--rubies, pearls and\namethysts--could roll out of the hidden pocket into Daoud's palm. Daoud\nadded them to the twelve already in his pouch.\n\n\"There, now you have the stones back. And now are you going to try to\nkill me?\"\n\nThere was a hint of challenge in that word _try_.\n\n\"If I had had all these jewels at the inn, I would have left you for\nthat crowd to kill. How could you be so stupid as to involve us in a\ntavern quarrel?\"\n\n\"I am no man's slave,\" Celino growled. \"Not Manfred's, and surely not\nyours.\"\n\n_But I am a slave. That is what the very word Mameluke means, and I am\nproud to be a Mameluke._\n\n\"Do you think, Celino,\" Daoud said softly, \"that you are a better man\nthan I?\"\n\n\"I think myself better than no man, and no man better than me.\"\n\nDaoud looked away. _Madman's talk._\n\nGazing up the river, he noticed a huge round shape bulking against the\nhorizon, a fortress of some kind. There might be danger from that\ndirection.\n\n\"Celino, you and Sophia and I are a little army in the land of our\nenemies. An army can have only one leader.\"\n\nCelino nodded. \"I know that. But you must understand that if I accept\nyou as our leader, it is of my own free will. I am still my own master.\"\n\nDaoud felt a strange mixture of admiration and uneasiness at this. He\nwas painfully aware that among Mamelukes a warrior of Celino's age would\nbe treated with great respect. Indeed, King Manfred clearly held Lorenzo\nin high esteem. His effort to save the old man had been noble in its\nway. But an impulse at the wrong time, even a noble impulse, could mean\ndeath for all of them.\n\n\"Does that mean you feel free to disobey me?\"\n\n\"I have done whatever you wanted up to now. Except for what happened at\nthe inn. That was different.\"\n\n\"Why different?\" Daoud demanded. \"You are not a stupid man, Celino. Why\ndid you do such a stupid thing?\"\n\nCelino shook his head and turned away. \"Angry as you are at me, Daoud,\nyou cannot be angrier than I am at myself. If I had not intervened, that\nman Angelo Ben Ezra might yet be alive and his child-wife not widowed.\nThey might have been hurt, and they surely would have been robbed. But I\ndo not think those tavern louts would have gone so far as to kill them.\"\n\nDaoud was astonished that Celino did not even defend his actions.\n\n\"Any more than we meant to kill any of those men,\" Daoud agreed. \"But a\nman of your experience knows that once the sword is drawn, only God\nknows who will live or die. Yet you drew your sword against them.\"\n\n\"The old man wandered in out of the night seeking hospitality. Instead,\nthey were beating him, and they were going to take his donkey and\neverything he owned and cast him out. Because he was a Jew.\"\n\n\"Yes, you Christians are very cruel to Jews. It is not so in the lands\nof Islam. But you should be used to seeing such things.\"\n\n\"I am not a Christian, Daoud. I am a Jew myself. And that is why I went\nto that old man's aid.\"\n\nDaoud blinked in surprise, then began to laugh.\n\n\"You find that funny?\"\n\n\"I am just as surprised to find out that you are a Jew as others would\nbe to find out that I am a Muslim.\" Daoud stopped laughing. \"I have\nknown many Jews in Egypt. Abd ibn Adam, Sultan Baibars's personal\nphysician, is a Jew. But why do you not wear the required hat?\"\n\n\"It is not required in Manfred's kingdom. And I would not wear it on\nthis mission any more than you would wear a Muslim's turban.\" Then\nCelino laughed. \"But if I were to drop my breeches, you would see the\nmark of Abraham.\"\n\n\"I have that as well,\" said Daoud with a smile. \"Muslims are also\ncircumcised. I was eleven.\" He remembered with a twinge the old mullah\nchanting prayers in Arabic, the knife whose steel looked sharper and\ncolder than any he had seen before or since.\n\n\"Now that mark is all I have left of the religion I was born into,\"\nCelino said.\n\n\"What do you mean? Did you convert to Christianity?\"\n\n\"I told you I am not a Christian. I profess no faith.\"\n\nDaoud drew back. A man who had no faith at all was somehow less than\nhuman.\n\n\"You believe in nothing?\"\n\n\"One of Manfred's Saracen scholars gave me a book by your Arab\nphilosopher Averro\u00ebs. In it he taught that there are no spirits, no\ngods, no angels, no human souls. All things are matter only. That is\nwhat I believe.\"\n\nDaoud made a casting-away motion. \"I have been taught that Averro\u00ebs is a\ngreat heretic. Now I see how wise we are not to read him.\"\n\n\"It was life that made me a nonbeliever. Averro\u00ebs only showed me that\nthere are learned men who think likewise.\"\n\nDaoud shook his head. Baibars would never allow such a man near him.\n\n\"Why does your king permit you to have no religion?\"\n\n\"The truth of it is, he thinks as I do. As his father, Emperor Frederic,\ndid before him. In the kingdom of Sicily under the Hohenstaufens, people\nmay believe as they please, as long as they are discreet about it. Of\ncourse, King Manfred must pretend to be a Catholic, or all the hosts of\nChristendom would fall upon his kingdom and destroy him. As for me,\nManfred trusts me because he knows I do not stand in awe of the pope.\nThe same reason he relies on his Saracen warriors.\"\n\nYes, Daoud thought, having no religion might make Celino a more useful\ncompanion for a mission like this. But how could Daoud trust a man who\nhad no faith in a higher power?\n\n\"But why did you try to fight for that old man? Look what you have done\nto us.\"\n\nCelino sighed and shook his head. \"He was so much like my own father. I\ncould not help myself.\"\n\n\"That is a poor excuse.\"\n\nCelino looked steadily into Daoud's eyes. \"It may seem so to you. It is\nsaid that Mamelukes scarcely remember their mothers and fathers.\"\n\nDaoud's body stiffened with rage. Celino's words were a blow that tore\nopen an old wound.\n\n\"You know nothing of that, and for your own safety you had best not\nspeak of it to me,\" Daoud said in a choked whisper.\n\nCelino inclined his head. \"I ask your forgiveness.\"\n\n\"Remember that if we fail in this mission, it will mean great harm to\nyour King Manfred, who has been so good to you and raised you so high,\"\nDaoud said.\n\nCelino's head was still lowered in submission. \"You are right to remind\nme of that. I have been foolish.\"\n\nDaoud gripped Celino's wrist. The Sicilian raised his head and stared\ninto Daoud's eyes.\n\nDaoud said, \"I must have your oath that this will never happen again.\nShould you see a hundred Jews having their throats cut, you will smile\nlike a good Christian and declare the sight pleasing to God.\"\n\n\"I will do my best, Daoud. That is all I can honestly promise you, but I\nthink it will be good enough.\"\n\n_By being honest, as he puts it, he still leaves himself room to defy\nme._\n\n\"And you will obey my commands from now on, as if they came from your\nking?\"\n\n\"You have my word of honor.\"\n\n_Whatever the honor of an unbeliever is worth. Manfred, what kind of a\ncrazed camel have you foisted off on me?_\n\nHere he was, far across the sea from the only home he had ever known, in\nthe midst of people who would kill him in an instant if they knew who he\nwas. And now he felt he could not trust one of the few men he must\ndepend upon. He felt a coldness beginning in his palms and spreading\nthrough his body as he wondered what further calamities like tonight's\nmight lie before them.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\n_The city that founded my city_, Sophia thought.\n\nSophia and David rode along the Tiber as it wound its way through Rome\nlike a brown serpent. Looking up from the riverbank, Sophia saw the\npeaked roofs and domes of churches, and the battlements of fortified\npalaces. The houses of the common folk huddled at the feet of the hills,\nand here and there remnants of old Rome rose like yellowed tombstones.\nToday's Romans, Sophia thought, built their hovels in the shadows of\nmarble ruins.\n\nSophia was impressed only by the age of the place. Her own city, the\nPolis, was everything now that this place had been centuries ago. Rome\nhad possessed civilization and had lost it. Constantinople had it still,\non a grander scale.\n\nAt dawn David's party had reached the place where the Tiber passed\nthrough crumbling city walls. Lorenzo and Rachel crossed the river into\nthe Trastevere quarter, where the Jews lived. Sophia wondered how they\nwould get past the watchmen at the city gate with the old man's body.\nWould Lorenzo tell a clever story, try bribery, or use his Ghibellino\nconnections? Or would he fail, and he and Rachel be arrested?\n\nDavid did not seem worried. She had seen his anger at Lorenzo. Perhaps\nhe hoped to be rid of him. For her part, she felt Lorenzo was far more\nher friend than David. She had known Lorenzo longer, and he had always\nbeen kind to her. She prayed he would return safely to them after\nfinding a haven for Rachel among the Jews of Rome.\n\nShe and David had entered the city through a gate on the east side of\nthe Tiber without difficulty. Evidently news of the incident at the inn\nhad not reached the Roman watch. In the city she rode beside David along\nthe river's east bank.\n\nShe touched David's shoulder and pointed to a hilltop.\n\n\"That hill is called the Capitoline,\" she said. \"At one time the whole\nworld was ruled from there.\"\n\nShe supposed David would find that hard to believe, though the hill was\nstill impressive, with a cluster of marble palaces at its top.\n\nThey were passing through one of the most crowded parts of Rome. On\ntheir left, fishermen hauled their nets out of the river, throwing\nflopping fish into baskets. On their right, shops in the ground floors\nof overhanging houses offered fruits and flowers and vegetables, fish,\nshoes, straw, rosaries, icons, relics, candles. Even at this early hour\nthe street was crowded. Romans jostled the horses David and Sophia rode,\nbut they gave Scipio plenty of room. Lorenzo had given the great\nboarhound a stern lecture, after which Scipio docilely allowed David to\nlead him on a leash.\n\n\"I have seen two other great imperial cities,\" said David. \"One was\nBaghdad, before the Tartars destroyed it. It was then much like this\ncity is now--its glory shrunken and faded, but still the center of our\nfaith, as Rome is the center of Christendom.\"\n\nSophia was taken aback at his casual error.\n\n\"Rome is the center of _Latin_ Christendom,\" she said sharply.\n\n\"Ah, how could I have neglected Constantinople and the Greek Church?\" He\nsmiled. The smile lit his deeply tanned face in a way that surprised\nher, held her gaze. She felt a warmth.\n\n_How smooth and brown his skin is._\n\n\"You must never forget Constantinople,\" she admonished him with a small\nsmile.\n\n\"I spent a month in Constantinople some years ago--that was the other\nimperial city--and I shall not forget it.\" This made her feel warmer\nstill toward him.\n\nThen his smile faded. \"Your city, too, has suffered at the hands of\nbarbarians--the Franks, who would destroy us.\"\n\n_Destroy us?_ she repeated in her mind. _Is he not a child of those\nFrankish barbarians?_\n\nOn the road from Lucera to Rome, he had told her--in a brusque fashion,\nas if he were speaking of someone other than himself--the story of his\nchildhood and how he came to be a Mameluke. She found it hard to believe\nthat he spoke of the killing of his parents and his enslavement by the\nSaracens as if it were some kind of blessing--but she had no doubt that\nhe was a believing Muslim through and through.\n\n\"Do you never think of yourself as a Frank, David?\"\n\nHe smiled again. \"Never. And I hope you will not think of me as one\neither. Because I know you must hate Franks.\"\n\nHate Franks? Dread them was closer to the truth. Last night, when they\nfought their way free of those people from the inn, she had remembered\nthe terror she had known as a girl in Constantinople. It was the return\nof that terror that had given her the strength to smash a jug over that\nhorrid woman's head.\n\nShe was about to reply to David when Scipio broke into loud barking.\nDavid frowned at the sight of something ahead. The Tiber made a sharp\nbend, and beyond that, on the opposite bank, towered a huge fortress, a\ngreat cylinder of age-browned marble--Castel Sant' Angelo.\n\nAt the base of the citadel was a bridge, and Lorenzo was crossing it.\nShe knew him even from this distance by his purple cap and brown cloak.\n\nSophia had expected to see Lorenzo return alone. It gave her a little\nstart of surprise to see that Rachel was still with him, still riding\ntheir spare horse.\n\nDavid angrily muttered something that Sophia guessed must be an Arabic\ncurse. He checked his horse. Sophia reined up her gray mare, and they\nsat waiting for Rachel and Lorenzo to come up to them.\n\n\"They want me as far away from them as possible,\" Rachel said. She\nclimbed down from her mount at once, as if acknowledging that she had no\nright to be riding it. She looked at David with an expression of appeal.\n\nThis was the first time Sophia had gotten a good look at Rachel. The\ngirl had removed the scarf that hid her hair, which was midnight-black\nand hung in a single braid down below her shoulders. A dusty purple\ntraveling cloak enveloped her slight body. Her skin was white as fine\nporcelain. The eyes under her straight black brows were bright, but\nSophia could see fear in them. She remembered herself ten years earlier,\na bewildered, terrified, orphaned girl in Constantinople.\n\n_I must help this child._\n\n\"Why will your people not take you?\" David said gruffly.\n\n\"They are afraid,\" said Rachel. \"When we told them what happened at the\ninn last night, they said we had put them all in deadly danger.\"\n\nLorenzo looked up from where he crouched scratching Scipio's long jaw.\n\"And we had better get out of the city quickly, before the rulers of\nRome start hunting for us.\"\n\nRachel went on. \"One of the rabbis took Angelo's body, and promised to\nbury him at once. That much they are willing to do. But they said they\ncould not protect me if I were discovered. Not only that, but it would\nbring persecution down on them.\"\n\nDavid said, \"But did you not appear to be a boy at the inn?\"\n\n\"The people at the inn saw a young person who could be boy or girl,\"\nsaid Lorenzo. \"The Jews here are constantly spied upon. There are\nmalshins, paid informers, among them. Their leaders think keeping Rachel\ntoo much of a risk, and knowing how many lives they have in their care,\nI cannot blame them.\"\n\nDavid glared at Lorenzo. \"Could you not do more to persuade them?\"\n\nLorenzo spread his hands. \"At first they did not trust me because they\nthought I was a Christian. When I told them I am a Jew, they still\ndistrusted me because I admitted being from Sicily. That must have made\nthem suspect that I am connected with King Manfred. The Jews of Rome\nlive as clients of the pope. They cannot afford to get involved with\nGhibellini.\"\n\nRachel pressed her hands on David's knee as he sat on his horse looking\ngrimly down at her. \"I beg you, let me come with you. There is no place\nfor me here in Rome.\"\n\n\"There is no place for you where we are going,\" he said gruffly.\n\nSophia felt herself melting within as she saw the misery on Rachel's\nface. Swinging her leg over her mare's back, she slid down, rushed over\nto the girl, and put her arms around her. She looked up at David.\n\n\"David, please.\"\n\nDavid looked down at her, his face hard, as if carved from dark wood,\nthe eyes glittering like shards of glass. She could not read his\nexpression.\n\n_How can I know what is in the mind of a Frank turned Turk?_\n\nDavid got down from his horse and beckoned to Sophia and Lorenzo. They\nfollowed him a short way along the street. When he turned to face them,\nSophia saw fury in his eyes, and her heart fluttered like a trapped\nbird.\n\nHe spoke softly, through tight lips, and his voice was as frightening as\nthe hiss of a viper. \"I begin to think King Manfred is my enemy, and the\nenemy of my people, sending the two of you with me on this journey. From\nnow on both of you will do as I command, and you will not question me.\"\n\nDesperately Sophia turned to Lorenzo. \"Can you not speak to him?\"\n\nLooking down at the cobblestones, Lorenzo shook his head. \"I made a\nterrible blunder, trying to help Rachel and her husband. From now on\nthings must go as David commands.\"\n\nIf Sophia had been arguing for herself, she could have said no more in\nthe face of David's fury. But she looked away from him to the small\nfigure standing by the horses, and her anguish for the child forced her\nto speak.\n\n\"But, David, what harm can Rachel do?\"\n\nNow the burning gaze was bent on her alone. \"We will be saying things\nabout ourselves in Orvieto that she already knows are not true.\" He\nturned to Lorenzo. \"You talk of the lives the Jewish leaders have in\ntheir care. You do not understand--you cannot understand--what will\nhappen to my people if I fail. What is it to you if the Tartars kill\nevery man, woman, and child in Cairo?\"\n\nHis voice was trembling, and Sophia realized he must have seen sights in\nthe East that made the terror of the Tartars real to him, as it could\nnot be to her.\n\n\"I owe the girl nothing,\" David went on vehemently. \"Nothing. It was not\nI who caused this.\"\n\nBut a little girl with her whole life before her, hanged or torn to\npieces by a mob-- The thought of it made Sophia want to scream at David.\nShe remembered the awful, mindless terror when she and Alexis ran\nthrough the streets of Constantinople with a roaring pack of Frankish\nmen-at-arms hunting them. Last night she had relived that terror when\nthey fled from the inn. She thought she would rather die herself than\nlet Rachel be taken by a mob.\n\n_I cannot abandon Rachel. I must try to sway him. Is there any way I can\ntouch David's heart?_\n\n_Of course. The same thing that moves me._\n\n\"David,\" she said, \"years ago, when you were a little boy--when the\nTurks killed your parents. Do you remember how you felt?\"\n\nDavid stared at her. So fixed were his eyes that for a moment she\nthought he might draw his sword and strike her down. She waited,\ntrembling.\n\n\"You have no right to speak of that to me,\" he said. His voice was tight\nwith pain.\n\n\"I know I have no right,\" she said. \"Can't you see how desperate I am?\"\nHope dawned faintly within her. She had touched him.\n\nHis silence stretched on while the turmoil of the city eddied about\nthem. She waited, trembling.\n\nHe spoke. \"He who taught me Islam said to me, 'To lift up a fallen\nswallow is to raise up your heart to God.'\"\n\nRelief flooded Sophia's body. She wanted to weep. Instead, she felt\nherself smiling. But David did not return her smile.\n\n\"Swear that this girl will learn nothing of our mission from you,\" he\nsaid. \"And you also, Celino. Swear it by all that you hold most holy.\"\n\n\"I swear it by Constantinople,\" said Sophia fervently and gladly.\n\n\"I will swear it on the lives of my wife and my children,\" said Lorenzo.\n\n\"I accept that,\" said David. \"And when we reach Orvieto, the girl leaves\nus, even if she starves in the streets.\"\n\n\"I will accept _that_,\" said Lorenzo.\n\n\"Lest you later forswear yourselves, there is one more thing that will\nassure your compliance,\" said David. \"Know that if this girl learns a\nword of what we are doing, she will die by my hand.\" He dropped his hand\nto the unadorned hilt of his sword.\n\nSophia felt cold inside. He cared about one thing only, after all.\n\nThey turned back. Sophia saw Rachel standing by a straw-seller's shop,\nlooking anxiously at them, holding the gathered reins of their horses in\nboth hands. Sophia realized that the girl might be thinking that they\nwere going to drive her off, and she hurried to Rachel with a smile,\nholding out her arms. She hugged Rachel, and tentatively, fearfully,\nRachel smiled back at her.\n\n\"You will come with us,\" she said. \"As far as we are going, to Orvieto.\nYou will have to leave us there, but we will help you find a home.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you, thank you,\" Rachel cried, and she burst into tears.\n\nLorenzo grinned reassuringly at Rachel. \"I told you it would be all\nright.\" When he grinned like that, his teeth white under his thick black\nmustache, he reminded Sophia of a large and satisfied cat.\n\nRachel looked up at David. \"I thank _you_, Signore. I know this is your\ndecision. May I know the name of my benefactor?\"\n\nDavid smiled bitterly. \"Benefactor? Rachel, if you had not met us, your\nprotector would still be alive. I am David Burian, a silk merchant of\nTrebizond. I go to Orvieto hoping to open trade between Trebizond and\nthe Papal States, and I have hired these people to help me.\"\n\n\"May I also help you, Signore?\" Rachel said. \"I learned something of\ncommerce from my husband.\"\n\n\"I think,\" David said, looking at Sophia and Lorenzo with sour humor, \"I\nalready have all the help I need.\"\n\n_At least the man is human_, thought Sophia. _He can joke a bit._\n\nShe felt encouraged. She had actually been able to touch the heart of\nthis man whose life and world were utterly strange to her.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nThere is so much water in this country, thought Daoud. Raindrops\nsparkled on every branch and leaf of the trees around him. The sky, once\nmore a bright blue after the thunderstorm that had passed over them, was\nreflected in water that still streamed through the ditches beside the\nroadway.\n\nFortunate that Rachel's husband, a man who had spent many months of the\nyear on the roads of Italy buying and selling books in the Jewish\ncommunities, had carried a tent with him. Daoud, Sophia, Rachel, and\neven Scipio had all crowded into it when they saw the storm coming. The\ntent had leaked, but the heat of the August afternoon would soon dry\nthem.\n\nDaoud hoped none of the others had noticed his fear during the storm. He\nhad been in the desert when lightning crackled in black clouds and the\nwind blew smothering waves of sand. But the thunderstorms they had been\nthrough had seemed to be just overhead, and so much water had fallen\nfrom the sky, Daoud was sure they would soon be drowned. It seemed\nalmost miraculous to him that he could emerge from Rachel's tent alive\nand find the world outside as intact as he had left it. Better than he\nleft it, because it was now washed clean of dust.\n\nHe walked to the edge of the road to see if Lorenzo was returning from\nOrvieto.\n\nOrvieto.\n\nAcross the valley, out of a deep-green forest rose a gigantic yellow\nrock shaped like a camel's hump. Crowning the hump, a wall of gray stone\nencircled the peaked roofs and bell towers of churches, the battlements\nof palaces and the red-tiled roofs of houses. One narrow road zigzagged\nup the steep side of the great rock, sometimes disappearing into clumps\nof trees, a white streak against the ocher cliffs. A city built on an\nalmost inaccessible mountaintop, like the strongholds of the\nHashishiyya.\n\nHe spied a horseman in purple cap and brown cloak descending the road\nfrom the city. Celino. Following him was a glittering gilt sedan chair\ncarried by four bearers.\n\nThe breeze that had brought the storm had died away, and Daoud was\nbeginning to feel the heat of the sun on the back of his neck. A mild\nsun compared to that of Egypt, even though this was the middle of the\nItalian summer, but he drew up his cotton hood to shade his head. He\nglanced over his shoulder. Rachel and Sophia were in the clearing on the\nother side of the road, watering the horses in a stream that ran down\nthe hillside. Rachel was nodding eagerly as Sophia talked. He hoped she\nwas not telling Rachel too much. Just as he himself might have told\nSophia too much, he thought ruefully.\n\nCelino arrived at Daoud's camp well ahead of the sedan chair. Scipio had\nbounded up the road to meet his master, and now licked the hand that\nCelino held out as he dismounted.\n\nCelino said, \"Cardinal Ugolini sends this messenger, who may surprise\nyou.\"\n\nWhen the sedan chair came to rest on the side of the road, Daoud saw\nthat the four bearers were black men of Africa. They wore scarlet vests,\nand sweat glistened on their bare arms and chests. Sheikh Saadi had been\nsuch a man, and there were many such men in the Egyptian army. Daoud\nwondered if these, too, were Muslims. In the city of the pope? Not\nlikely.\n\nTwo of the bearers drew back the curtains of the chair and reached\nwithin. Bejeweled white fingers grasped the bearers' muscular arms, and\na turban brocaded with gold pushed out past the curtains, followed by a\nround body swathed in lime-green silk.\n\nDaoud was not surprised. This must be the one who called herself\nMorgiana in the letters to Baibars that came regularly from Italy by\ncarrier pigeon and ship, thought Daoud. Still clinging to the bearers,\nthe stout woman pulled herself erect. Then she waved her servants away\nwith a flapping of sleeves and a jangling of bracelets and squinted at\nDaoud.\n\n\"Is it time?\" said Daoud. He spoke in Arabic.\n\n\"Not yet,\" she answered in the same language. \"But presently.\" That\ncompleted their prearranged words of recognition.\n\n\"Salaam aleikum, Morgiana,\" he said, smiling. \"Peace be to you.\" He\npushed back his hood and bowed to her. He had a warm sense of meeting an\nold friend. He had read many of her reports on matters of state in\nItaly.\n\n\"Wa aleikum es-salaam, Daoud,\" she replied. \"And peace also to you. You\nwill have to know my real name now. Tilia Caballo, at your service.\"\n\nHe had pictured Morgiana as a tall, slender woman of mature years,\ndarkly attractive. The real Morgiana was quite different. Her eyebrows\nwere thick and black, her nose a tiny button between round red cheeks.\nHer face was shiny with sweat even though she had been doing nothing but\nsitting in a sedan chair. Looking at her spherical body, Daoud felt\ngreat respect for the strength of the men who carried her. The silk\nclinging to her body outlined breasts like divan cushions, and her belly\nprotruded in a parody of pregnancy. Could she truly be a cardinal's\nmistress? Just as sultans and emirs had chief wives who were old and\nhonored and younger wives for play, perhaps Cardinal Ugolini kept Tilia\nCaballo only as his official mistress.\n\nThe clasp on her turban was studded with diamonds. A heavy gold necklace\nspilled down the broad, bare slope of her chest. From the necklace\ndangled a cross set with blue and red jewels.\n\n_The gold Baibars has sent her helped buy the fortune she wears._ He\nwondered, how much did Baibars really know about this woman?\n\n\"I saw Cardinal Ugolini for a moment only, Messer David,\" said Celino.\n\"As soon as he found out I was from you, he insisted that I go to this\nlady's establishment.\" Celino, speaking the dialect of Sicily, uttered\nthe word stabilimento with a curious intonation. Scipio stood with his\nforepaws on Celino's chest, and Celino scratched the hound behind the\nears.\n\n\"He means the finest house of pleasure in all the Papal States,\" said\nTilia Caballo, smoothing the front of her gown with a self-satisfied\nlook. \"Naturally his eminence Cardinal Ugolini cannot risk meeting\nopenly with you until I have seen you on his behalf.\" She had switched\nfrom Arabic to an Italian dialect that was new to Daoud. He had trouble\nunderstanding her.\n\nHe did not think it had been mentioned, in her letters or by Baibars,\nthat she was a brothel keeper. He felt slightly repelled. He wondered if\nBaibars knew. He must. Baibars knew everything.\n\n\"Take yourself away, Celino,\" Daoud ordered. \"And tell those two to come\nno closer.\" He pointed to the forest clearing where Sophia and Rachel\nwere already starting toward him. \"I must be alone with Madonna Tilia.\"\n\n\"Yes, Messere,\" said Celino with a bow. Scipio paced ahead of him like a\ntame lion as he walked off.\n\n\"We expected you to enter Orvieto alone,\" said Tilia, looking at Sophia\nand Rachel, who were staring back at her from across the road. \"Why this\nentourage?\"\n\n_And I expected to meet with Cardinal Ugolini at once_, thought Daoud\nwith growing irritation. _Has he set this woman up as a barrier between\nhimself and me?_\n\nHe explained briefly how Celino, Sophia, and Rachel came to be traveling\nwith him. Tilia gazed at him with a falcon's piercing stare. Daoud was\nnot used to being stared at by a woman, and she made him uneasy. But he\nmet her eyes in silence until she turned to her slaves and made a\ndropping gesture with her hand. The Africans immediately squatted in the\ngrassy clearing where they had set Tilia's chair. Daoud realized that he\nhad not heard a sound from them, and suspected they must have been made\ndumb.\n\n\"Come.\" Tilia took his arm, again surprising him. In Egypt women did not\ntouch men they had just met. But she owned a house of pleasure. She was\nnot a respectable woman.\n\nWhy should that bother him, he asked himself. He had spent his share of\ntime in houses of pleasure along the Bhar al-Nil. What he felt toward\ntheir owners was mostly gratitude.\n\nTilia drew Daoud with her into the thicket along the hillside, stepping\ngracefully, despite her bulk, around shrubs and over rocks and fallen\nbranches. She led him away from the road and into a grove of pine trees\na little way up the slope. Daoud felt his muscles tightening. He was\ngoing to have to undergo more testing before she would let him meet\nUgolini. Did they really think that Baibars would send a fool to\nOrvieto?\n\n\"Spread your cloak for me.\" She pointed to a spot under an old pine\nwhose trunk rose straight and bare twice the height of a man before the\nfirst branch sprouted. Daoud unclasped his brown cloak and laid it on\nthe thick bed of brown pine needles. Tilia sat down, smiled, and patted\nthe place beside her.\n\n\"A messenger brought the news to the pope yesterday that the Tartar\nambassadors have landed at Venice,\" she said. \"They are on their way to\nOrvieto and should be here in a week or so. They are well protected.\nThey brought their own bodyguard, which is now reinforced by a company\nof French knights and Venetian men-at-arms under a certain Count de\nGobignon.\"\n\nDaoud felt a tingle of anticipation, as he did when he was about to\nclose with the enemy in a battle.\n\n\"So I will be in Orvieto before them. That is good.\"\n\n\"Yes, but Cardinal Paulus de Verceuil has arrived here before _you_. He\nspeaks for the King of France, and he has already begun to press the\ncase for a Tartar alliance before Pope Urban. He has arranged for the\nTartars and their guards to live at the palace of the Monaldeschi\nfamily.\"\n\nDaoud caught an intonation in Tilia's voice that suggested it was a\ngreat accomplishment for the Tartars to live at the Monaldeschi palace.\nWas she trying to discourage him?\n\n\"What is this Monaldeschi family?\" he asked.\n\n\"The oldest and richest family in Orvieto,\" she said. \"Right now the\ncapo della famiglia, the head of the family, is the Contessa Elvira di\nMonaldeschi, who is over eighty years old. But she is more ruthless and\nsavage than many a younger man. Almost all her menfolk have been killed\noff by their blood enemies, the Filippeschi, and she has had many\nFilippeschi killed.\"\n\n\"What do they fight about?\" said Daoud.\n\n\"Who knows? A Monaldeschi kills a Filippeschi, so a Filippeschi kills a\nMonaldeschi. It has been going on forever.\" Tilia went on. \"What you\nmust realize is that the Tartars will be well guarded because the\ncontessa has more men-at-arms than the pope and a very strong palace.\"\n\nHe turned away from Tilia. Daoud stared out through the screen of pine\nbranches at Orvieto's sunlit rock platform. A wagon inched its way up\nthe narrow road.\n\n\"Who is this French count who guards the Tartars?\" he asked.\n\n\"Count Simon de Gobignon. He is very young and very rich. He holds huge\nestates in France and numbers his vassals in the thousands. He is close\nto the French royal family, even King Louis himself and the king's\nbrother, Charles d'Anjou.\"\n\nCharles d'Anjou. Daoud remembered Lorenzo saying that Charles d'Anjou\ncoveted the throne of Sicily.\n\nA flash of light caught Daoud's eye. A party of helmeted men in yellow\nand white surcoats had come out of the main gate of Orvieto, formed a\nragged column and were patrolling along the base of the city wall, led\nby a man with a white plume on his helmet.\n\n\"Who are those soldiers?\" he asked.\n\nTilia leaned forward to peer through the trees and across the valley,\nthen resettled herself against the tree trunk.\n\n\"Pope Urban has two hundred Guelfo fighting men quartered in Orvieto. In\nall honesty, Daoud--\"\n\n\"Call me David,\" he interrupted. \"Here I must be known by a Christian\nname.\"\n\n\"Well, David, I think you had best go quickly back to Egypt. What can\none man do against the French royal family, half the cardinals, the\npope, the Monaldeschi, and the Tartars themselves?\"\n\nHe felt a quick spurt of anger. He knew as well as she did the odds he\nfaced. Why was she trying to weaken him by making him afraid?\n\n_Ugolini sent her to discourage me. It is he who is afraid._\n\nHe felt more respect for her, coming out and meeting him and trying to\ninfluence him, than he did for this Cardinal Ugolini, who was trying to\nprotect himself. He knew from having read her letters that she was a\nshrewd and brave woman. He had to win her cooperation. There was only\none way he might hope to do that.\n\nDaoud smiled at her. \"Does not great wealth give one great power?\"\n\nShe smiled back. He noticed that she had rubbed some kind of red\ncoloring on her cheeks to make herself look healthier. And she had\npainted blue-black shadows around her eyes, as Egyptian women did. But\nhere and there her sweat had made the paint run in rivulets.\n\nShe said, \"Only faith is more powerful than money.\"\n\n\"Then here is power.\" Daoud unbuckled his belt and let the jewels spill\nout of its hollow interior into his hand. He heard Tilia gasp. When the\nglittering stones filled his hand, he dropped them gently to the thin\nwoolen cloak he had spread on the ground and shook the rest out of the\nbelt. In the shadow of the pines the jewels seemed to give off their own\nlight from their polished, rounded surfaces, red and blue, green and\nyellow. A sapphire, a topaz, and a pearl were each set in heavy gold\nrings. The others were loose. Some were so small that three or four of\nthem would fit on the tip of Daoud's finger. One, a ruby, was the size\nof a whole fingertip. There were too many of them to count quickly, but\nDaoud knew that Manfred had given him twenty-five, and one had gone to\nequip them for the journey.\n\n\"Sanctissima Maria! May I touch them?\"\n\n\"You are welcome to,\" he said, smiling, \"but make sure none of them\nsticks to your fingers.\"\n\nShe plucked some of the jewels from the cloak and let them trickle\nthrough her fingers, catching the light as they tumbled to the cloak.\nShe held the big ruby up between thumb and forefinger and studied it,\nturning it this way and that.\n\n\"A drop of God's blood.\"\n\n\"You should have seen the single emerald I traded to King Manfred for\nthese smaller stones. There was beauty. A few at a time, these can be\nturned into gold.\"\n\nShe looked into his eyes. She took him more seriously now, he thought.\nHe was not just some strange Muslim whose rashness might get her killed.\nHe was a source of wealth.\n\n\"They must be sold carefully, or their sudden appearance will be\nnoticed,\" she said. \"After all, even the princes of the Church would\nhave to stretch their purses for these.\"\n\n\"I have it in mind to buy princes of the Church, not to sell jewelry to\nthem.\"\n\n\"We can sell some of these gems to the Templars. They have enormous\nwealth and they are very discreet.\"\n\nNoting that she had said \"we,\" Daoud smiled at the thought of those\nferocious enemies of the Mamelukes, the Knights Templar, helping to\nprovide the financing that would weaken their foothold in Islamic lands.\n\n\"Now,\" he said, \"do you think we can accomplish something to keep\nTartars and Christians apart?\"\n\n\"Yes--something. Used wisely, these jewels--or their worth in gold--will\ngain you influence among the men around the pope. You might even pry a\nfew of the French cardinals loose from their loyalty to King Louis.\"\n\nDaoud began scooping up the stones and funneling them into the hidden\npocket of his belt. \"You must help me to use them wisely.\"\n\n\"Exactly what do you have in mind?\" she asked, her eyes fixed on the\njewels as they disappeared.\n\n\"I expect Cardinal Ugolini to take some of the gold and use it to build\na strong party in Orvieto that will oppose the alliance.\" He eyed her,\ntrying to see into her heart. \"Can he manage such a thing?\"\n\n\"Oh, Adelberto is an old hand at intrigue. How else do you suppose he\ngot to be a cardinal? Indeed, he is the camerlengo for the College of\nCardinals.\"\n\n\"What does that mean?\" Daoud asked as he buckled his belt.\n\n\"He acts as a kind of chancellor to the pope, making announcements,\ncalling the College together, conducting ceremonies--that sort of\nthing.\"\n\nDaoud nodded. \"Good. It is my hope that he can use this money to draw\ncardinals and Church officials to him, one way or another. And they will\njoin together to turn the pope against the Tartars.\"\n\n\"With all the money those jewels will bring, you can indeed create such\na faction, but I don't know what effect it will have on the pope. The\nTartars offer the pope a chance to wipe out Islam once and for all.\"\n\n\"Yes, and then after that the Tartars will wipe out Christianity,\" Daoud\nsaid. \"I can tell those who will work with us what the Tartars are truly\nlike. I have seen them, fought against them. I have seen what they have\ndone to those they conquered.\" Like a cloud passing over the sun, a\nmemory of ruined Baghdad darkened his mind.\n\nTilia's eyes opened wide. \"You intend to meet and talk--to bishops, to\ncardinals?\"\n\nHe touched his face with his fingertips. \"This is why Baibars sent\nme--because I can go among Christians as a Christian. I will be David of\nTrebizond, a silk merchant who has traveled in the lands ravaged by the\nTartars.\"\n\n\"Trebizond?\"\n\nHe could see the doubt in her face. He must seem confident to her. He\nmust not let her know that he himself wondered how he, a warrior from a\nland utterly strange to these people, could make the great ones of\nChristendom listen to him and believe in him. He could do it only with\nthe help of Tilia and Cardinal Ugolini--and they would not help him\nunless they believed he could do it.\n\n\"Trebizond is on the eastern shore of the Black Sea. Far enough away\nthat I am not likely to meet anyone in Orvieto who knows anything about\nit.\"\n\n\"Do not be too sure. The pope makes a point of seeing people from\neverywhere.\"\n\n\"Then he will probably want to meet me, since I am from a strange and\nfaraway place.\"\n\nHer eyes widened and her full lips parted. Her teeth were small, bright,\nand widely spaced.\n\n\"You even want to meet with the _pope_?\"\n\nHe knew the enormity of what he was proposing. But he fought down the\ndoubt that her evident horror had aroused in him. He made himself sound\nabsolutely sure when he answered.\n\n\"Certainly. Cardinal Ugolini will arrange an audience for me. If the\npope has not yet made a decision, he will want to listen to one who has\nseen with his own eyes what these Tartars are. I will tell him that an\nagreement with them would be like a lamb allying itself with a panther.\"\n\n\"Talk to the pope! How would you know how to behave before the pope?\"\n\n\"Among my people, Madonna, I am not just a warrior. I stand high in the\nhighest councils. I have met with kings and great men of religion. As\nfor the details of etiquette of an audience with the pope, as a traveler\nfrom Trebizond I might be expected to make mistakes.\"\n\nDaoud saw that her olive skin had turned a yellowish-white. \"Do you want\nto be torn to pieces by teams of horses?\" she whispered. \"I do not, and\nneither does Cardinal Ugolini. We cannot risk your being found out.\"\n\nHe must overcome her doubt of him by seeming supremely confident.\n\nHe said, \"Then, for your own protection, you will teach me everything I\nneed to know.\"\n\nAnd if Christians moved closer to Tartars despite intrigue and\npersuasion, he and Baibars had already considered more desperate\nmeasures. The risk of failure would be greater and the consequences more\ndire. He would not tell Tilia about these more drastic steps. If his\npresence and intentions already frightened her and Ugolini, it was best\nthey not know the lengths he was prepared to go to.\n\nHe hoped he would not have to attempt such things. The complexities and\ndifficulties of making them happen, the likelihood of things going\ndisastrously wrong, all made these courses too daunting.\n\nInsh'Allah, if it be God's will, he would manage, with the help of such\nallies as he found in Orvieto, to oppose and obstruct and delay the\nalliance until the project died of old age, or the Tartar ambassadors\nthemselves died.\n\n_Time fights for Islam_, Baibars had told him. _The Tartar empire is\nbeginning to break apart, and the Christians are losing their eagerness\nfor crusading. Only delay this alliance long enough, and their\nopportunity to destroy us will be lost._\n\nTilia broke in on his thoughts, holding out her hands to him. \"Help me\nup. My legs are getting cramped. I feel hungry. Do you have anything to\neat?\"\n\nHe was not surprised that she asked for food. Mustapha al-Zaid, the\nchief eunuch of Baibars's harem, was monstrously fat, and was always\neating.\n\nHe sprang to his feet and pulled her up. The cross on her bosom swung\nand flashed. The top of her head came only to the middle of his chest,\nbut he suspected that she weighed as much or more than he did.\n\nShe smiled at him. \"You are strong, and you move like a warrior.\"\n\nIgnoring the flattery, he said, \"Sophia has bread and cheese that we\nbought at a village called Bagnioregio. And some red wine to wash it\ndown.\"\n\nTilia laughed. \"Bagnioregio? Then you must have passed near the ruins of\nFerento--the town that was destroyed for the heresy of displaying a\nstatue of Christ on the cross with open eyes.\"\n\n\"What? I saw no ruins. Open eyes?\"\n\n\"The ruins are off the road. But that will give you an idea of how\ncareful one must be where religion is concerned. I cannot imagine that\nanyone makes decent wine in Bagnioregio. There is another town near\nhere, Montefiascone, where they make the best wine in the world. Wait\nuntil you taste that.\"\n\n\"I drink wine only to deceive Christians,\" he said gruffly. \"I do not\nlike it. Let us finish this conversation before you refresh yourself. I\ndo not want those two to know any more than I tell them.\"\n\nAnnoyance flickered in her face. She was not used to being denied, Daoud\nthought. But she shrugged. \"I presume you plan to use that beautiful\nwoman who travels with you as bait to win over some of the high-ranking\nchurchmen.\"\n\nTo Daoud's surprise, the thought pained him.\n\n\"She is a skilled courtesan and was Manfred's mistress,\" he said. \"And\nbefore that, King Manfred told me, she was a favorite of the Emperor of\nConstantinople. We will want to keep her in reserve. I have in mind that\nshe could live with the cardinal, pose as his niece.\"\n\n\"Hm. And the other girl? She is very pretty and very young. The older\nand more powerful churchmen are, the more they are drawn to youth.\"\n\n\"We owe Rachel a debt. We have promised to find a home for her among the\nJews of Orvieto.\"\n\n\"Oh, is she a Jew? But there are no Jews in Orvieto.\"\n\n\"Somewhere nearby, then.\"\n\n\"The nearest Jews live in Rome.\"\n\nRome--where the Jews had already turned Rachel away. \"She cannot go to\nRome.\"\n\n\"Well, the girl would find working for me far more rewarding than living\non charity.\"\n\n\"I am sure of it,\" said Daoud. But a dark memory from long ago rose to\ntrouble him.\n\nHe fixed his eyes on hers. \"You would not force her into whoring, would\nyou?\"\n\nTilia pressed her hand to her bosom in mock horror. \"Force! Women _beg_\nto be accepted into the family of Tilia Caballo.\"\n\n_A terrible thing to do to the child, but it would solve my problem_,\nthought David. _Rachel already must be aware that Sophia and Lorenzo and\nI are involved together in some secret enterprise. It would be best to\nkeep her where we can watch her._\n\n\"For the time being, Rachel will stay with us at the cardinal's mansion,\nserving Sophia as her maid,\" he said.\n\nTilia looked up at him, startled. \"You _all_ intend to live with the\ncardinal?\"\n\nHer surprise, in turn, startled Daoud. But then he saw that her eyes\nwere too firmly fixed upon him, and knew that she was dissembling.\n\n\"As Morgiana, did you not approve this arrangement with my lord the\nsultan?\"\n\nShe shrugged. \"That was when we thought you were coming alone.\"\n\n\"Sophia and Lorenzo will be of great help to us. We will give it out\nthat I am the cardinal's guest. Lorenzo will be my servant, Giancarlo.\nAnd Sophia will be the cardinal's niece.\"\n\n\"Hm.\" Tilia frowned. \"I am _very_ hungry. Let me sample the delicacies\nyour Greek woman bought in Bagnioregio. Then I will go back to the city\nand send word to the cardinal of what you have told me.\"\n\nDaoud heard the false note in her voice and bristled with suspicion.\n\n_And you would keep me waiting out here while you warn him of what a\ndanger I am to him._\n\n\"I will tell him everything myself.\"\n\nHer eyes clouded over. \"The cardinal will send for you when he has heard\nmy report.\"\n\n\"Great God, woman!\" Daoud's voice rasped in his anger. \"Do you expect\nme to wait out here until the Tartars come to Orvieto? I am sent by the\nsultan, I bring great wealth to you and your master, I am fighting for\nmy faith, _and I will not wait_!\"\n\nTilia patted his arm placatingly. \"Look here, Daoud, in all honesty,\nCardinal Ugolini is terrified. When he first got Baibars's message about\nyou, he wept for hours, cursing himself over and over for a fool.\nImagine the outrage if the Christians were to discover that a Muslim\nagent has come so close to their pope. The cardinal would never have\ntaken the first denaro picciolo from your sultan if he had ever known\nthat it would lead to this--a Turk at his door demanding his help in a\nplot against the pope.\"\n\n\"I am not at his door,\" said Daoud pointedly.\n\n\"No, and before you arrive there, you must give me time to assure him\nthat you know what you are doing, that you do not look anything like a\nTurk, and above all that you bring him such great wealth as to make the\nrisk worthwhile. If you just appear at his palace when he has insisted\nthat you wait here, it might throw him into a panic. He might do\nsomething very foolish.\"\n\nAnger flared up in him. She was obstructing him and threatening him, and\nhe had had enough.\n\n_She means he might expose me. Or order his men-at-arms to kill me. This\nis Manfred's indecision all over again._\n\nHe seized Tilia's arm, his fingers sinking into soft flesh under her\nsilk sleeve. \"I am going to the cardinal, with my party. And you will\nequip me with a message for him, telling him you feel assured it is safe\nfor him to admit us.\"\n\nShe stared up at him, expressionless, for a long time. He sensed that\nshe was trying to see into his heart, to weigh his will.\n\n\"No,\" she said. \"You are not going now. First--\"\n\nHis grip on her arm tightened, and in his anger he was about to shake\nher, when her hand darted to lift the pectoral cross from her breast.\nHer thumb pressed a dark red carbuncle between the arms, and a thin\nblade sprang out of the shaft.\n\n\"Please notice that the cross is attached to my neck by a chain, David.\nI cannot hurt you unless you come too close to me. I have no wish to\nattack you. There is asp venom on the blade, by the way.\"\n\nHis anger turned against himself. It was foolish to try violence on a\nwoman like this. Had he not told himself he could not force Tilia and\nUgolini to do anything, that he must persuade them?\n\n_This woman herself is as dangerous as an asp. But I need her._\n\nHe let go of her arm. \"Pardon my crudity, Madama.\"\n\nTilia pointed her blade straight up and pressed another jewel in the\ncross. The blade dropped back into the shaft.\n\n\"I do not mind crudity,\" she said, \"but I do not like to be manhandled.\"\nShe smiled slyly. \"Unless I've invited it. I had already made my mind\nup, before you laid violent hands on me, that I would agree to your\ngoing at once to the cardinal. I have decided that you may be able to\naccomplish what you set out to do without getting us all killed. You are\nbrave and intelligent, but you know how to bargain, too. You know when\nto yield and you know when to stand your ground.\"\n\nDaoud felt pleasure at her compliments, but even more pleasure that she\nwas going to cooperate with him.\n\n\"Then why did you just say we would not be going to the cardinal?\"\n\n\"I was about to add that first you _will_ feed me bread and cheese and\nthe execrable wine of Bagnioregio. _Then_ I _will_ give you a message\nthat will get you into Cardinal Ugolini's mansion.\"\n\nDaoud laughed. That Tilia had yielded was a great relief. And she was\nboth witty and dangerous, a combination he admired.\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\n\nSimon was surprised at how young Cardinal Paulus de Verceuil looked. The\nman who stood with him in a vineyard on the road to Orvieto had a long,\nfine-skinned face and glossy black hair that fell in waves to his\nshoulders. If his scalp was shaved in a clerical tonsure, his red velvet\ncap covered it. His handsome violet silk tunic reminded Simon that his\nown surcoat was travel-stained and that Thierry had not polished his\nmail in days.\n\nDe Verceuil tossed away the cluster of pale green grapes he had been\nnibbling and spoke suddenly.\n\n\"Count, a report has reached me that you spoke rudely to the doge of\nVenice.\" His booming bass voice sounded as if it were emerging from the\ndepths of a tomb. \"You do realize that your actions reflect on the crown\nof France?\"\n\nHe thrust his face into Simon's as he spoke, which made Simon\ninvoluntarily draw back. De Verceuil was one of the few men Simon had\never met who matched his own unusual height.\n\nSimon felt his face grow hot. \"Yes, Your Eminence.\"\n\n\"And how could you dismiss the trovatore Sordello from the post to which\nCount Charles himself appointed him?\"\n\n\"If Sordello had stayed with us, the Tartars might have taken such\noffense as to go back to Outremer.\"\n\n\"Do not be absurd. Would they abandon a mission of such importance\nbecause of a tavern brawl?\"\n\nSimon felt shame, but, deeper than that, resentment. He was the Count de\nGobignon, and not since he was a child had anyone chastised him like\nthis.\n\nHe heard a rustling as someone came down the row of vines where they\nwere standing. He turned to see Friar Mathieu, and hoped he was about to\nbe rescued.\n\nAfter the Franciscan had humbly greeted the cardinal and kissed his\nsapphire ring, he said, \"I must tell Your Eminence that what happened\nwas not a mere tavern brawl. Sordello stabbed and nearly killed the heir\nto the throne of Armenia, an important ally of the Tartars.\"\n\nDe Verceuil stared at Friar Mathieu. The cardinal had a mouth so small\nit looked quite out of place below his large nose and above his large\nchin. A mean mouth, Simon thought.\n\n\"Your opinion does not interest me,\" de Verceuil said. \"I cannot imagine\nwhy King Louis trusted a beggar-priest to conduct diplomacy with the\nempire of Tartary.\"\n\nThe resentment Simon had felt at the cardinal's harsh speech at his\nexpense now flared up in anger.\n\n_I am young and I do make mistakes_, Simon thought. _But, cardinal or\nnot, this man has no right to stand there in his velvet and satin and\njewels and sneer at this fine old man. No right at all._\n\nBut the old friar merely stroked his white beard with a wry smile and\nsaid, \"I said that very thing to him myself, when he ordered me to go.\"\n\nStill angry, Simon took a deep breath and said, \"Since Your Eminence\nfeels I have embarrassed the king and displeased the Count of Anjou,\nthere is only one course open to me. I will resign my command of the\nambassadors' guards.\"\n\nSimon stared into de Verceuil's eyes, and the cardinal's eyelids\nfluttered. In the silence Simon heard a blackbird calling in nearby\nolive trees.\n\n_I never wanted to come here. I let Uncle Charles talk me into it. I do\nnot mind the danger. And it would be exciting to outguess a hidden enemy\nwho is trying to murder the Tartars. But I cannot endure the way this\nman humiliates me and my friends. I will go back to Gobignon now._\n\n\"You must not let a bit of fatherly correction wound you so deeply,\nCount,\" said the cardinal, his voice still deep and dirgelike but no\nlonger full of scorn. \"I would never suggest the Count of Anjou had made\na mistake in choosing you for this post.\"\n\n_Fatherly! What a disgusting thought!_\n\nBut Simon could see that his resigning worried de Verceuil. Uncle\nCharles wanted Simon to guard the ambassadors, just as he had wanted\nSordello to head the archers. He had his reasons. And de Verceuil did\nnot want to cross Charles d'Anjou.\n\nFriar Mathieu laughed gently, and patted Simon on the shoulder. \"If you\nplease, be kind enough to change your mind about resigning. All of us\nare aware that you have carried out the task with intelligence and zeal.\nIs that not right, Your Eminence?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said de Verceuil, his mouth puckered and sour. \"Count, I\nwould have you present these Tartar dignitaries to me.\"\n\n\"I will be happy to interpret for you, Your Eminence,\" said Friar\nMathieu. De Verceuil did not answer him.\n\nAs they crossed the vineyard, the cardinal stretched out his long arm\nand said, \"I have brought musicians, jongleurs, senators of Orvieto,\nmen-at-arms, two archbishops, six bishops, an abbot, and many monsignors\nand priests.\" A long line of men stretched down the road into the nearby\nwoods. Most of them wore various shades of red; a few were in\ncloth-of-gold or blue. The points of long spears flashed in the\nsunlight. Banners with fringes of gold and silver swung at the tops of\npoles. Seeking protection from the mid-August heat, men walked horses in\nthe shade of the woods.\n\nBeyond the treetops rose a distant pedestal of grayish-yellow rock\ncrowned by a city. An astonishing sight, Orvieto.\n\n\"The Holy Father will be meeting us at the cathedral and will say a\nspecial mass of thanksgiving for the safe arrival of the ambassadors,\"\nsaid de Verceuil. \"I want the entry of the Tartars into Orvieto to\nimpress both the Tartars themselves and the pope and his courtiers.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Monsters!\"\n\n\"Cannibals!\"\n\nRotten apples, pears and onions, chunks of moldy bread, flew through the\nair. Small stones that did not injure, but stung. And worse.\n\nThe shouts and missiles came from both sides of the street, but always\nwhen Simon was looking the other way, so he could not see his\nassailants. The people crowded in front of the shops were mostly young\nmen, but women and children were scattered among them. They wore the\ndull grayish and brownish garments of workers and peasants. The\nstreet-level windows behind them were shuttered, and the doors were\nclosed tight. That was a sure sign, Simon knew from his Paris student\ndays, that the shopkeepers expected trouble.\n\nFrom the Porta Maggiore, the main gate where they had entered, the\nstreet curved toward the south side of the town. Though the upper\nstories of many houses overshadowed the street, there was room enough\nfor the procession to move along, four horses abreast, and for the\nunruly people to gather on either side. Approaching the south wall of\nthe city, the street made a sharp bend to the left, and Simon had lost\nsight of the Tartar emissaries behind, who were--_What a\nmistake!_--being carried in an open sedan chair. Were they being pelted\nwith garbage?\n\nWhy were the people of Orvieto doing this? True, everyone in Christendom\nhad heard wild tales of the Tartars. That they were monsters with dogs'\nheads. That they bit off the breasts of women. That they stank so\nabominably they overcame whole armies just with their smell. That they\nwere determined to kill or enslave everyone on earth. There were\nchurches where people prayed every Sunday to be delivered \"from the fury\nof the Tartars.\"\n\nBut it had been over twenty years since the Tartars had invaded Europe,\nand even then they had come no farther than Poland and Hungary. Why\nshould these people of Orvieto turn so violently against them now, when\nthey came in peace?\n\nUndoubtedly someone was stirring them up.\n\n_Hang de Verceuil and his orders_, Simon thought. _I should be with the\nambassadors. If someone wants to kill them, this would be a perfect\nchance._\n\nHe tugged on the reins of his palfrey, pulling her head around. \"Make\nway!\" he shouted, spurring his horse back the way he had come.\nMen-at-arms with spears and crossbows cursed at him in various Italian\ndialects, but they opened a path, pushing back the people. Thierry rode\na small horse in Simon's wake.\n\n\"Imps of Satan!\" came a shout from the crowd. \"The Tartars are devils!\"\n\nSimon scanned the faces below him. Some looked angry, some frightened,\nmany bewildered. No one looked happy. The cardinal's hope for an\nimpressive entry into Orvieto had been quite dashed, and Simon felt a\nsneaking pleasure at that.\n\nPassing the corner where the procession had turned, he saw again a\nbuilding he had passed earlier, a formidable three-story cube of yellow\nstone with slotted windows on the ground floor and iron bars over the\nwider upper windows.\n\n_And there is a man who looks happy._\n\nHe was standing in sunlight, leaning out from the square Guelfo\nbattlements on the roof of the big building. His hair was the color of\nbrass, his skin a smooth brown, such as Simon had seen on pilgrims newly\nreturned from the crusader strongholds in Outremer. The blond man gazed\ndown on the jostling, shouting crowd, smiling faintly.\n\nAs Simon rode past him, their eyes met. Simon was startled by the\nintensity of the other's gaze. It was as if a wordless message had\ncrossed the space between them. A challenge. But then the blond man\nlooked away.\n\nThe Tartar ambassadors, seated side by side in a large sedan chair, were\nfarther up the street. Here, Simon noticed with relief, the crowd had\nfallen quiet. Perhaps curiosity about the Tartars, with their round\nbrown faces and many-colored robes, had overcome whatever had roused\nthese people against them. Then, too, the Tartars were surrounded by\ntheir Armenians marching on foot, curved swords drawn, as well as by\nSimon's knights on horseback, and Venetian crossbowmen. The archers'\nbows, Simon noticed, were loaded and drawn. Who had ordered that?\n\nDe Verceuil on a huge black horse--no palfrey this, but a powerful\ncharger--rode up to Simon. \"Why did you not remain in the forefront?\nWhat is going on up ahead?\"\n\nWithout trying to defend himself, Simon described the disturbance.\n\n\"Could you not control the rabble?\" de Verceuil growled, and turned to\ntake a position beside the Tartars' sedan chair.\n\nSimon's face burned, and his hands trembled as he stared after de\nVerceuil.\n\nWhen they passed the yellow stone building, Simon looked up and saw the\nblond man still there on the roof. The man was staring down at the\nTartars with that same burning look he had thrown at Simon, but there\nwere no weapons in the hands that gripped the battlements.\n\nSimon heard a slapping sound and an angry cry. He turned to see de\nVerceuil, his right cheek smeared brown.\n\n_God's death! Someone threw shit at him! And hit him right in the face._\n\nThe cardinal, his face distorted as if he were about to vomit, was\nstaring at the stained hand with which he had just wiped his cheek.\n\nThere was laughter from the crowd, mixed with angry cries of \"Bestioni!\nCreatures from hell!\"\n\nFor an instant Simon felt laughter bubbling up to his lips, but cold\nhorror swept all amusement away as he sensed what was about to happen.\n\nDe Verceuil turned to the nearest crossbowmen, who had not suppressed\ntheir own smiles.\n\n\"Shoot!\" he shouted. \"Shoot whoever did that!\"\n\nThe smiles remained fixed on the faces of the Venetians as three of them\naimed their already-loaded crossbows at the crowd. They did not\nhesitate. This was not their city; these were not their people. They\nwere fighting men who did as they were ordered.\n\nPeople screamed and shrank back against the shuttered doors and windows.\n\nThree loud snaps of the bowstrings came at the same moment as Simon's\ncry of \"No!\"\n\nHe shouted without thinking, and was surprised to hear his own voice.\nHis cry echoed in a sudden and terrible quiet.\n\nScreams of agony immediately followed. People darted away from the place\nwhere the crossbowmen had aimed, leaving that part of the street empty.\n\nEmpty save for three people. Two of them screamed. One was silent--a\nyoung man who half sat, half lay against the stone wall of a house.\nBlood was pouring out of his mouth and more blood was running from a\nhole in his chest. Simon saw that the blood was coming in a steady\nstream, not in rhythmic spurts, which meant the fellow's heart had\nstopped. A glance at the white face told Simon the dead youth could be\nno more than sixteen.\n\nBeside the boy, a woman knelt and wept. She was plump and middle-aged,\nperhaps his mother. Her white linen tunic was bloodied.\n\n\"He did nothing!\" she cried. \"Oh, Jesus! Mary! He did nothing!\" There\nwas a plea in her voice, as if she might bring the boy back to life if\nonly she could persuade people of his innocence.\n\nThe other cries came from a man who stood about a yard from the dead\nboy. The bolt had gone through his left shoulder just above the armpit\nand pinned him to the oaken post of a doorway. He wanted to fall, but he\nhad to stand or suffer unbearable pain.\n\n\"Help me!\" he begged, casting pain-blinded eyes right and left. \"Help\nme!\"\n\nSimon jumped down from his horse, throwing the reins to Thierry, and ran\nto the man. He put his left hand on the chest and pulled at the flaring\nend of the quarrel with his right. He could not move it. The bolt was\nburied too deeply in the wood. The man's forehead fell against Simon's\nshoulder, and he was silent. Simon hoped he had fainted.\n\nNow Simon saw where the third bolt had gone. Six inches of it, half its\nlength, was buried in a wall a few feet to Simon's right. The wall was\nmade of the same grayish-yellow stone Orvieto was built on.\n\nThe crossbow bolt in the man's shoulder was thick and made of hard wood.\nSimon had nothing that would cut the man loose without hurting him even\nmore. He looked up and down the street. It was quite empty now, except\nfor a few people watching from a distance. The procession had gone on.\nHe glanced up and saw that the blond man had left his place on the roof.\n\nFriar Mathieu knelt beside the dead young man, one hand moving in\nblessing, the other resting on the shoulder of the weeping woman.\n\nDe Pirenne and Thierry, both mounted, the equerry holding Simon's horse,\nlooked at him uncertainly.\n\n\"Go, Alain!\" said Simon impatiently. \"Stay with the Tartars.\"\n\nHe himself was neglecting his duty, he thought, as de Pirenne galloped\noff. But now that he was trying to help this poor devil, he could not\nabandon him.\n\n\"Can I do anything, Monseigneur?\" Thierry asked.\n\nAs Simon was about to answer, he saw a middle-aged man wearing a\ncarpenter's apron.\n\n\"Messere, can you bring a saw?\" he called. \"Hurry!\"\n\nIt seemed hours before the man returned with a small saw with a pointed\nend and widely spaced teeth. He held it out to Simon.\n\nSimon wanted to shout at the carpenter, but he took a grip on himself\nand said patiently, \"You are bound to be better at sawing than I. Per\nfavore, cut away the end of the crossbow bolt so we can free this man.\"\n\nGingerly at first, then working with a will, the carpenter sawed off the\nflaring end of the bolt with its thin wooden vanes. The pinned man awoke\nand was sobbing and groaning.\n\nOnce the protruding part of the bolt was sawed away, Simon took a deep\nbreath, wrapped his arms around the sobbing man, and pulled him away\nfrom the wall. The man screamed so loudly that Simon's ears rang; then\nthe man sagged to the ground. Blood flowed from the wound in his\nshoulder, soaking his tunic. Blood coated the stump of the bolt, still\nstuck in the door post. Simon dropped to his knees beside the wounded\nman. A pool of bright red widened rapidly on the flat paving stones.\n\n_Now what do I do with him? I must get back to my duty._\n\nHe spoke with the carpenter. \"Press your hand on the wound, hard. That\nwill slow the bleeding.\" Simon took the man's hand and put it on the\nhole the crossbow bolt had made.\n\n\"Here, let me do that.\" Friar Mathieu was on his knees beside the hurt\nman, his hand covering the wound. \"Messere,\" he said to the carpenter,\n\"ride my donkey to the hospital of the Franciscans. Tell them there is a\nman badly hurt here and Friar Mathieu d'Alcon says they are to send\nbrothers to take him for treatment.\"\n\nSimon stood up slowly as the carpenter climbed on Mathieu's donkey.\n\n\"It is not safe for you to stay here,\" he said to Friar Mathieu. \"The\npeople know you were part of the procession and may blame you for what\nhappened.\"\n\nMathieu shook his head. \"No one will hurt me. Go along now.\"\n\nSimon jumped into the saddle and spurred his palfrey to a trot. Thierry\nrode beside him.\n\n\"Those two didn't throw anything,\" Thierry said.\n\n\"Of course not.\" Simon wondered if de Verceuil cared that the Venetians\nhad shot two innocent men.\n\nWhen Simon caught up with the procession, de Verceuil was still\nfuriously scrubbing his face with his pale violet cloak.\n\n\"If you had done something sooner about the rioting, this outrage would\nnot have happened to me,\" he said, a quaver of anger in his deep voice.\n\n_God help me_, thought Simon. _I could easily grow to hate him. Cardinal\nor not._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWord of the shootings must have spread through the city, Simon thought,\nbecause the twisting street leading to the cathedral was nearly empty.\n\nBut the piazza in front of Orvieto's cathedral of San Giovenale was\npacked with people. Simon's eye was immediately drawn to the top of the\ncathedral steps. There stood a white-bearded man wearing a red mantle\nover white robes glittering with gold ornament. On his head a tall white\nlozenge-shaped miter embroidered with a red and gold cross. In his hand,\na great golden shepherd's crook at least seven feet tall. Simon's mouth\nfell open and he held his breath.\n\nThe ruler of the whole Catholic Church the world over, the chosen of\nGod, the anointed of Christ, the heir of Saint Peter. His Holiness,\nUrban IV, the pope himself. Simon felt almost as much awe as he had that\nday in Paris when King Louis had let him kiss the Crown of Thorns.\n\n_How lucky I am to be here and see this man whom most Christians never\nsee. It is close as one can come to seeing Jesus Christ Himself._\n\nIt looked to Simon as if the Holy Father were glowing with a\nsupernatural light. To his left and his right stood a dozen or more men\nin bright red robes and wide-brimmed red hats with long red tassels\ndangling down to their shoulders. The cardinals, the princes of the\nChurch. Simon wondered if the Tartars realized what honor this did them.\n\nAs soon as their sedan chair was set before the pope, the two short\nbrown men stepped out of it, knelt, and pressed their foreheads to the\ncobblestones. They stayed that way until the pope gestured to de\nVerceuil, who bent and touched them on the shoulder and raised them up.\n\nThe pope turned and, followed by the Tartars and then the cardinals,\nproceeded into the cathedral. For this meeting to succeed, a papal mass\nwas the best possible beginning.\n\nSo many people were ahead of Simon that Friar Mathieu caught up with him\nbefore he was able to enter the door of the cathedral.\n\n\"What do you think stirred up the crowd like that?\" Simon asked as they\npushed through the people standing in the nave of the church.\n\n\"In the cities of Italy the mob is always either furious or ecstatic,\"\nsaid Friar Mathieu.\n\n\"But to defile a cardinal!\" Simon said. \"That would never happen in\nFrance.\"\n\n\"Italians do not reverence the clergy as much as Frenchmen do,\" the\nFranciscan said with a little smile. \"They have had to put up with the\nprinces of the Church for so long that they are a good deal less awed by\nthem.\"\n\nThe interior of the cathedral was ablaze with the light of a thousand\ncandles, but Simon was not impressed by the windows, which were small\nand narrow and filled with dull-colored glass. This was an old church,\nhe thought, remembering the huge windows of many-colored glass in the\nnewer cathedrals of France.\n\nThe crowd was so tightly packed that Simon and Friar Mathieu could not\nget to the front of the nave, where chairs had been set before the altar\nfor dignitaries. They had to be content with standing halfway down the\nlength of the church. Simon thought wryly that he was getting used to\nbeing pushed into the background. Perhaps he was accepting it too\neasily.\n\nPope Urban, his white hair uncovered, had raised high the round wafer of\nbread for the Consecration of the Mass, when an angry shout echoed\nthrough the cathedral.\n\nA chill went through Simon's body, cold as a knife blade. Using his\nshoulder as a wedge, he forced his way through the crowd toward the\nsource of the sound, near the front of the church.\n\n\"Ex Tartari furiosi!\" the man was shouting in Latin. \"Libera nos,\nDomine!\" _From the fury of the Tartars, Lord deliver us!_ Cries of\ndismay rang out near the disturbance, and people began shouting in\nItalian.\n\n\"Stand aside! Let me through!\" Simon shouted. If this were an assassin,\nreverence for the mass, even for the pope, must be set aside. Again and\nagain the shout rose, \"Ex Tartari furiosi!\" It was harder to move\nthrough the crowd. People were struggling to get away from the man\nmaking the uproar.\n\nSimon stopped, shoved men right and left to make room, and pulled his\nscimitar from his scabbard.\n\nPeople around him turned at the unmistakable rasp of steel on leather, a\nsound that so often preceded sudden death. They saw the Saracen sword in\nSimon's hands and drew back. As Simon hoped, more people noticed and\nfell over one another trying to get out of his way.\n\nLike Moses' rod parting the Red Sea, Simon's scimitar opened a path for\nhim.\n\nSimon saw a young man with a tangled mass of brown hair whipping about\nhis face and a brown beard that spread over his chest. He was big and\nbroad-shouldered, and he wore a plain white robe, ragged and gray with\ndirt, and sandals. In one hand he held a dagger.\n\n_Blood of Jesus! He must have come here to kill the Tartars._\n\nTerrified people had opened a circle around the white-robed man, and as\nhe moved toward the front of the cathedral the open space moved with\nhim.\n\n\"Stop!\" Simon cried.\n\nBaring greenish-looking teeth in a snarl, the man swiveled his shaggy\nhead toward Simon, then immediately rushed at him.\n\n_He's crazy_, Simon thought, a hollow feeling in the pit of his stomach.\nHe crouched, holding his sword out before him, diagonally across his\nchest.\n\n\"Do not kill him!\" boomed a deep voice that Simon recognized as de\nVerceuil's.\n\nThe man with the dagger hesitated now, just out of reach of Simon's\nsword.\n\n_Am I to risk my life to keep this madman alive?_\n\nBut de Verceuil's demand made sense. They must try to find out who sent\nthe man.\n\nSimon took a deep breath. He had practiced sword fighting innumerable\ntimes, but only twice in his life had he come up against an armed man\nwith a look in his eyes that said he was willing to kill.\n\n_But this is no different from practice_, he told himself.\n\nHe feinted to the white-robed man's left, then jumped forward, lifting\nhis sword high and bringing the flat of it down with all his strength on\nthe hand that held the dagger. The dagger tumbled through the air. Simon\nsaw at once that the man had no martial skill.\n\nThe madman darted forward in a crouch to retrieve his dagger, and as he\ndid so Simon kicked him in the chin. The thick beard protected the man's\nchin from the full force of Simon's pointed leather boot, but he\nstaggered. Before the bearded man recovered himself, Alain de Pirenne\ncharged out of the crowd, seized him in a bear hug, and wrestled him to\nthe ground.\n\n\"Ex Tartari furiosi!\" The shouts rang out again and again as the pope's\nguards dragged the would-be assassin out of the church.\n\nSimon saw Pope Urban shake his bare white head slowly, then turn back to\nthe high marble altar and raise the Host overhead once more.\n\nDe Verceuil and Friar Mathieu reached Simon at the same time.\n\nThe cardinal held out his hand for the dagger, which Simon had\nretrieved, and studied it. \"One could buy a hundred like it in any\nmarketplace,\" he said, keeping his voice low now that the mass had\nresumed. He thrust the dagger into his black leather belt with a shrug.\n\n\"The white robe and sandals are the mark of the Apostolic Brethren,\"\nsaid Friar Mathieu. \"Heretics who preach the doctrine of Joachim of\nFloris about a coming new age of enlightenment and equality.\"\n\n\"When it comes to heresy,\" said de Verceuil with an unfriendly grin,\n\"there is little to choose between the Apostolic Brethren and the\nFranciscans. Many of your brethren are secret Joachimites.\"\n\n\"Of course, he might have been dressed that way only to deceive us,\"\nFriar Mathieu went on, ignoring the insult.\n\n\"We will find out who he is and whence he comes,\" said de Verceuil.\n\"When we are through with him he will tell us everything. I have ordered\nhim handed over to the podesta of Orvieto, who will subject him to\nquestioning in his chamber of torment.\" He turned on the ball of his\nfoot, his violet cloak swinging out behind him, and headed back toward\nthe altar.\n\n_And not a word about my disarming the assassin_, Simon thought angrily.\n\nFriar Mathieu winced and shook his head sadly. \"Then again, that man may\nnot be able to say anything. And the less he can tell us, the more he\nwill suffer. I pity him.\"\n\nSimon cringed inwardly at the thought that by capturing the mad heretic\nhe was the cause of the man's being subjected to horrible tortures. But\ngreater fears preoccupied him. The Tartars had been in Orvieto only a\nfew hours, and already the people had been stirred up against them and\nthey had nearly been assassinated. Somewhere in this town an enemy\nlurked, and Simon's body turned cold as he wondered what that enemy\nwould do next.\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\n\n_A letter from Emir Daoud ibn Abdallah to El Malik Baibars\nal-Bunduqdari, from Orvieto, 21st day of Rajab, 662 A.H.:_\n\n    Although the central part of Italy, the Papal States, is said to be\n    under the control of the pope, I have learned that his army is\n    barely large enough to protect his person and nowhere near enough to\n    enforce his authority. Manfred could attack the pope whenever he\n    wished, but he does not do so because he fears that the other\n    princes of Europe would then attack him.\n\n    The northern part of Italy is divided among a number of cities, each\n    of which is a small independent nation. These cities are often at\n    war with one another. The most important are Venice, Genoa,\n    Florence, Milan, Siena, Pisa, and Lucca.\n\n    Within each city there is also constant warfare among various\n    factions. The palaces of the great families are all heavily\n    fortified.\n\n    Italy is also divided between two parties, the Ghibellini and the\n    Guelfi. These parties are to be found everywhere, constantly at each\n    other's throats. They arose long ago in the northern part of the\n    Holy Roman Empire, where the German language is spoken. The\n    Hohenstaufen emperors came from the town of Waiblingen. And in the\n    early days of the Hohenstaufens their enemies were a family named\n    Welf. In Italy Welfs and Waiblings have become Guelfi and\n    Ghibellini.\n\n    Each day I come to realize more and more how complicated the history\n    of Europe is. It seems that most of Italy has been claimed by the\n    Holy Roman Empire--but Rome itself is not part of that empire.\n    Members of the Hohenstaufen family have been Holy Roman Emperors for\n    over two hundred years, and they have always been at war with the\n    popes. Why the emperor should be called \"holy\" when he is\n    traditionally the enemy of the pope I do not understand.\n\n    Furthermore, at this time there is no Holy Roman Emperor. The last\n    one was Conrad, son of Frederic and half brother of Manfred. He died\n    ten years ago, and then Manfred proclaimed himself king of southern\n    Italy and Sicily. The German part of the Holy Roman Empire is in a\n    more chaotic state than Italy, if my lord can imagine such a thing.\n\n    Here in Orvieto, where the pope has settled for his safety, there\n    are no Ghibellini. The townsmen have managed to find other reasons\n    to fight among themselves. The chief rivalry is between two great\n    families, the Monaldeschi and the Filippeschi. Since the Tartar\n    emissaries are guests of the Monaldeschi, I hope to make friends\n    with the Filippeschi.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSeated at a table in his little room at Cardinal Ugolini's, Daoud made\ntwo copies of his letter to Baibars on small sheets of parchment scraped\nso thin as to be almost transparent. He had written the letters in a\ncode using the Arabian system of numbers. Even if the message suffered\nthe unlikely fate of being intercepted and finding its way to one of the\nfew Arabic-reading Christians, it would remain an enigma.\n\nDaoud rolled up the two letters tightly and put them in the leather\nscrip at his belt. He stepped out of his room into a narrow corridor.\nDoors on his right opened into rooms for Ugolini's guests and\nhigh-ranking members of his staff. On his left, oiled-parchment windows\nlet light into the corridor from the atrium of the mansion.\n\nUgolini's cabinet, his private workroom, was at the end of the corridor,\nwhere it turned a corner. Daoud walked up to the heavy oaken door and\nraised his fist to knock.\n\nHe felt light-headed, as he did when going into combat. This was combat\nof a kind. He had been a guest in Ugolini's mansion for over two weeks\nnow, and he had already, he thought, hurt the Tartars' prospects for an\nalliance with the Christians. But he needed to do much more, with help\nfrom Ugolini. The cardinal, Daoud knew, would be absolutely terrified at\nthe thought of his Muslim guest appearing before the pope.\n\nAnd to appear before the pope, with the cardinal presenting him, was\nprecisely what Daoud wanted to do.\n\nHe knocked on the cabinet door.\n\nTo the muffled query from within he answered, \"It is David.\"\n\nHe heard a bolt slide back, and he entered the cabinet. Cardinal Ugolini\nreturned to the high-backed chair at his worktable, which was strewn\nwith leather-bound books and parchment scrolls. In the middle of the\ntable lay a large, circular brass instrument Daoud recognized as an\nastrolabe. On shelves behind the cardinal, besides many more books and\npapers, were a stuffed falcon, a stuffed owl, and a human skull with a\nstrange diagram painted on the cranium. Windows of translucent white\nglass in two walls let in an abundance of light. A good place to work,\nthought Daoud.\n\n\"I hope I do not disturb you, Your Eminence,\" said Daoud.\n\n\"Not at all, David,\" said the cardinal. \"It is very necessary that we\ntalk.\"\n\nCardinal Adelberto Ugolini was a short, stout man with long gray\nwhiskers that swept out like wings from his full cheeks. His receding\nchin was as bare as the bald top of his head, partly covered now by a\nred skullcap. He wore a plain black robe, like a priest's, but from a\nchain around his neck hung a gold cross set with five matching blue\njewels. Daoud wondered if the cross concealed a poisoned stiletto like\nTilia's. Besides books and scrolls, Daoud noticed, there were rows of\nporcelain jars on the shelves against the wall. Each had a Latin word\npainted on it. Ugolini might well dabble in poison.\n\n\"The man they seized in the cathedral is to be publicly torn to pieces,\"\nUgolini said. \"They have been torturing him in the Palazzo del Podesta\nfor three days and two nights, but they have learned nothing from him,\nexcept that he is a member of the Apostolic Brethren, a follower of the\nheretic Joachim of Floris.\"\n\n_If I am to go before the pope, I must learn about the disputes among\nChristians. It would not do to offend the Christian leaders by\naccidentally uttering heresy._\n\n\"What does this Joachim teach?\"\n\nUgolini waved his hands dismissively. \"Joachim died long ago, but his\nrubbish and madness still stir up the simple folk. The Church is too\nwealthy. The clergy are corrupt. The Age of the Holy Spirit is coming,\nin which there will be peace, justice, and freedom and all property will\nbe owned in common.\"\n\nThe doctrines of the Apostolic Brethren sounded to Daoud like the\nteachings of the Hashishiyya, as told to him by Imam Fayum al-Burz.\n\nUgolini shook himself like a wet dog. \"It is dangerous for you to\ninvolve yourself with such people as the Brethren.\"\n\n_It is dangerous for me to be here at all_, Daoud thought, irritated at\nUgolini's timidity.\n\n\"This heretic does not know me, so there is nothing he can tell them\nthat will point to us. You need not fear.\"\n\n\"I feel no fear,\" Ugolini said grandly. \"How did you get that man to\ndraw a dagger in the cathedral?\" Ugolini asked. \"And the crowd, how did\nyou stir them up?\"\n\nDaoud saw the tiny quiverings of Ugolini's pupils, the tightness of his\nlips, the clenching of his jaws, the signs of a man in a permanent state\nof terror.\n\nDaoud shrugged and smiled. \"Celino found the madman preaching against\nthe Tartars at a crossroads and had men in his pay bring him to Orvieto.\nWe did not tell him what to do. He did what he was moved to do. As for\nthe crowd, all that was needed was for Celino to drop a word here and a\ncoin there. Many people believe the Tartars are demons from hell.\nPerhaps they are. Anyway, I think we have turned the people of Orvieto\nagainst the Tartars.\"\n\n\"You are like a child playing with flint and tinder in a barn full of\nstraw,\" said Ugolini, blinking his eyes rapidly.\n\n_He must be prodded into action_, Daoud thought. _Tilia said the idea of\nmy appearing before the pope would terrify him. We must settle that\ntoday._\n\nDaoud walked to one of the four mullioned windows. The casements swung\ninward for air. Looking down through the iron bars on the outside of the\nwindow, Daoud regarded the street where the Tartars had passed. The\npottery maker across the road had washed away the bloodstains and was\nsitting in front of his shop displaying his brightly colored wares.\n\nWhat would move this man Ugolini--money, threats, the promise of\npersonal power?\n\nHe turned back and made himself smile.\n\n\"You do not want me here, Your Eminence.\"\n\nUgolini looked at him for a long moment, and finally said, \"For over a\ndozen years Baibars has been a far-off figure who sends me small rewards\nin return for scraps of harmless information. Now, suddenly, his agent\nis in my home, demanding that I, the cardinal camerlengo of the Sacred\nCollege, risk death by torture to deceive the pope and betray the\nChurch. In a week or two in the cathedral piazza, they will do horrible\nthings to that poor mad heretic. But his sufferings will not be the\ntenth part of what they will do to me--and to you--if we are found out.\"\n\nDaoud bowed his head. \"The sooner I complete my work, the sooner I am\ngone.\"\n\nWhile he let that sink in, he decided that with his next words he would\npit his boldness against Ugolini's timidity.\n\n\"So, you must present me to the pope as soon as possible.\"\n\nUgolini's eyes grew wide and his mouth trembled. His stare, with his\nsharp nose, tiny chin, and trembling whiskers, gave him the look of a\njerboa, one of those desert rats that Daoud had hunted with hawks in\nPalestine.\n\n\"Tilia told me you had some such mad notion,\" said the cardinal. \"If you\nspeak to the pope and his court, every important man in Orvieto will\nsee you. If you make the slightest slip that could reveal what you\nreally are, they will be on you like hounds on a fox.\" He laughed\nnervously. \"No, no, no, no. I might as well take you to de Verceuil and\nsay, 'Here is the enemy you are looking for. Behold, a Muslim, even a\nMameluke! And, by the way, it was _I_ who brought him into Orvieto.'\"\n\nUgolini covered his eyes with his hand. He did look as if he had been\nlosing sleep, Daoud thought, remembering what Tilia had told him.\n\nDaoud felt his teeth grinding together in frustration. It would be\neasier to fight a band of Tartars than to try to put courage into this\none little man. And he needed more from the cardinal than compliance.\n\n_I must make him want, not just to help me, but to lead the opposition\nto the Tartars. Otherwise this will be like trying to move the arms and\nlegs of a dead man._\n\n\"The cardinals speak Latin to one another, do they not?\" Daoud asked. \"I\nwill say my piece in Greek and you will translate it into Latin for me.\nSo you will have a chance to cover any errors I make.\"\n\n\"Why must you go before the pope?\" Ugolini demanded. \"It is foolish\nbravado. Remain in seclusion and tell me what you want done and I will\nhave it done for you.\"\n\nThe thought of keeping himself in hiding while trying to act through\nothers made Daoud's flesh crawl. But there was a bit of hope here. At\nleast Ugolini was offering to do _something_.\n\n\"This is a thing only I can do,\" Daoud said. \"Only I have seen the\nTartars, met them in battle. Only I have seen what they do to a\nconquered city.\" The sight and smell of those heaps of rotting corpses\narose in his mind, and he shut his eyes momentarily. \"What I can say is\ntoo important a weapon to be left unwielded. I know the Tartars better\nthan any man in Orvieto, except for that priest in the brown robe who\ncame with them. And he is on the other side.\"\n\n\"How will you tell what you know without admitting that you are a Muslim\nwarrior?\"\n\n\"Many Christian traders now visit the lands occupied by the Tartars.\nDavid of Trebizond has been one of them.\" He spread his arms. \"As you\nsee, I now dress like a wealthy merchant.\"\n\nCelino had gone out with a bag of florins from Ugolini's first sale of\njewels, and he had come back with a chest full of new clothes for Daoud.\nToday Daoud wore a silk cape as red as a cardinal's robe. It was light\nin weight and came down to his knees, more for display than for\ncovering. Under the cloak he wore a tunic of deep purple embroidered\nwith gold thread.\n\nUgolini shook his head. \"Clothing will not deceive the pope and those\naround him. You are asking too much of me.\"\n\nDaoud wished he could give this up. Ugolini was nothing but a sodden\nlump of fear. But he had no choice but to keep trying. The cardinal was\nhis gateway to the papal court.\n\n\"Think of the reward,\" Daoud urged. \"Part of the wealth I have brought\nwith me is already yours. If the pope sends the Tartars away without an\nagreement, my sultan will give to you with both hands.\"\n\nUgolini looked tormented. \"But the peril--\"\n\nDaoud had been certain that money would not be enough to enlist\nUgolini's cooperation. Baibars already had been generous with him.\n\n_Bribes alone will not move this man._\n\nAs he searched his brain for another approach, his eyes explored the\nroom. The skull, the powders, the brass instruments. Ugolini was a\nstudent of many strange things, things verging on magic. Were these not\nodd interests for a Christian prelate? He knew Greek, which was rare for\na Latin Christian. He had spoken of heresy before. Was he not, in his\nwillingness to correspond with Baibars, a heretic of a kind? And perhaps\nin these studies of his as well.\n\n_I must remind him that he sympathizes with us._\n\n\"My master sent me to you because he knows you are a friend to Islam.\"\n\nUgolini raised a cautioning hand. \"Mind you, I am a Christian.\"\n\n\"I do not doubt it,\" said Daoud.\n\n\"Not a very good Christian,\" Ugolini went on, sighing and looking off\ninto space. \"God grant that I make a good confession before I breathe my\nlast. But I am also of the south of Italy, and in my youth I lived side\nby side with Muslims. I had Muslim teachers, wise men. From them I\nlearned about philosophy, medicine, astrology, alchemy. I learned how\nmuch there is to know that I may never know.\"\n\nDaoud felt his eager heart beat more rapidly. Ugolini was speaking just\nas he wanted.\n\n\"God help me, I yearn so for more worldly knowledge,\" Ugolini went on.\n\"That was why I studied for the priesthood, so I could go to the\nUniversity of Napoli. But what one can learn at a Christian university\nis not enough. I want to know what you Saracens know. And so I long for\npeace between Christendom and Islam.\"\n\nDaoud felt excitement surge through his arms and legs. He was\nexhilarated, as when in battle he sensed his opponent was weakening.\n\nHe pressed his point. \"You will never possess the knowledge you long for\nif the Tartars destroy it. Think what was lost when they leveled\nBaghdad. Think what will be lost if they destroy Cairo, Thebes,\nAlexandria.\"\n\n\"Oh, God!\" Ugolini cried, waving hands bent like claws. \"There is so\nmuch I could learn in Egypt. If only this stupid enmity between Muslim\nand Christian did not hold me back. I am tortured like Tantalus.\"\n\n\"As cardinal camerlengo, the pope's chamberlain, you could bring before\nthe pope a traveler from far away whose testimony might influence his\ndecisions about the Tartars. Because of you, all that would be lost\nmight be saved.\"\n\nDaoud held his breath, waiting for Ugolini's reply.\n\nUgolini smiled resignedly. \"To work for what I believe in, to help my\nfriends. And to be rewarded with riches. How can I refuse?\" His\nexpression changed again as he looked earnestly at Daoud. \"I do not know\nas much as your great Islamic astronomers, but I have plotted the\ncourses of some stars, and I know how they rule our destinies. And my\nrecent readings have told me that I will take a risk that will yield me\nrewards beyond my hopes.\"\n\n\"Then you will present me to the pope as a witness?\"\n\nUgolini first shook his head, but then sighed and nodded. \"I can propose\na meeting. And may the stars watch over us,\" he added as his right hand\ntraced the Christian sign of the cross on his forehead, shoulders, and\nbreast.\n\n_The stars, your Messiah, and the One God I worship_, thought Daoud. He\nallowed himself momentarily to feel the thrill of triumph. Ugolini had\nbegun to move as he wanted him to. But now he must prepare himself for a\nmuch greater trial, his meeting with the pope.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA little while later, walking through a ground-floor doorway into the\nsunlit atrium of Ugolini's mansion, Daoud saw Sophia and Rachel standing\nby the fish pond, under orange and lemon trees. The polished dark-green\nleaves reflected the mid-morning sun upward and cast shade downward on\nthe stone paths and the pool. Reflected sunlight rippled over Sophia's\npeach-colored gown. A narrow gold bracelet on her wrist flashed as she\nraised her hand to make a point. The answering smile that lit Rachel's\nface foretold that she would be a beautiful woman in a few years. She\nwas dressed better than she had been when they first met her, Daoud\nnoticed. That ankle-length blue silk gown must belong to Sophia.\n\n\"The cardinal has just had an immense turbot delivered all the way from\nLivorno, Messer David,\" said Rachel, her black eyes bright with wonder.\n\"Alive, in a barrel of water. Look, you can see it down there at the\nbottom.\"\n\nDaoud looked down into the clear water, saw a tapering dark shape moving\ngently just above the yellow pebbles lining the bottom of the pool.\nSmaller brown carp darted this way and that above it.\n\n\"The cardinal's gold makes great things possible,\" he said. \"Will you\nleave us for a while, Rachel?\"\n\nSophia handed a small leather-bound book to Rachel. \"You may read these\npoems of Ovid if you like.\"\n\nRachel clasped the book to her narrow chest. \"I do not read Latin,\nSignora, but I will look at the pictures.\"\n\n\"Have a care,\" said Sophia with a light laugh. \"Some of them may shock\nyou.\"\n\n\"Then I will try to enjoy being shocked.\" Rachel bowed and hurried away.\n\nDaoud listened to the banter between the woman and the girl with mixed\nfeelings. He liked both of them, and he enjoyed hearing them joke with\neach other. He imagined women must talk that way among themselves back\nin El Kahira, but if they did, men never had a chance to hear.\n\nHe also felt deeply uneasy at the growing closeness between Rachel and\nSophia. The two of them shared a room on the top floor of Ugolini's\nmansion, next to Daoud's and Lorenzo's. His stomach tightened as he\nthought of the long talks they might have. What if Rachel learned that\nSophia was actually a Byzantine woman, when she was supposed to be the\ncardinal's niece from Sicily? And what if Rachel then let that slip to a\nservant? Byzantines, Greek Catholics, were hated almost as much as\nMuslims here in the lands of the Latin Church. One small, seemingly\nharmless revelation like that could destroy them utterly.\n\n_I must get them separated._\n\nTurning to Sophia, Daoud was struck once again that so much beauty\nshould openly display itself outside a harem. A narrow cloth-of-gold\nribbon wound around her neck, crossed between her breasts and tied her\npale peach gown tightly at the waist. Her lustrous black hair was bound\nin a net of gold thread.\n\nShe looked at him quizzically. Daoud studied her face. Her long,\nstraight nose, dark red lips and delicate chin made him glad that\nChristian women went unveiled. He could well believe this woman had\nenjoyed the attentions of an emperor and a king. He himself could not\nlook at her without wishing he might take her in his arms.\n\n\"Well, my Frankish-Turkish master-slave, what has your busy mind found\nfor me to do? Do you wish me to get myself shot in the street by\nVenetians? Or create a disturbance in church and be tortured to death?\"\n\nHer thrusts caught Daoud off balance. Feeling a surge of anger, he was\nsilent for a moment.\n\nThen he jabbed a finger at her. \"Do you understand what is at stake\nhere?\"\n\nHer full lower lip pushed out. \"I do not understand why you had to send\na pious simpleton to a horrible death.\"\n\nGuilt twisted in Daoud's guts like a Hashishiyya dagger. Yet he could\nnot admit to Sophia that he regretted what happened to the heretic. She\nmight approve his feeling, but she would also lose confidence in him.\n\n\"I will use any weapon I can find,\" he said. \"Even if it breaks in my\nhand.\"\n\nSophia sat down on the marble lip of the fish pond. After a moment's\nhesitation Daoud sat beside her, smoothing his red cloak under him.\n\n\"Where is Lorenzo?\" she asked. \"I have not seen him since the day the\nTartars arrived.\"\n\n\"He visits Spoleto, to find a few bold men for me.\" Lorenzo would bring\nback two or three men from Spoleto. Later he would gather more men in\nViterbo, Chiusi, and other nearby cities. Imperceptibly over the coming\nmonths, bands of armed men--the Italians called them \"bravos\"--would\ngather in Orvieto to do Daoud's bidding.\n\nActing as a go-between for Daoud and the bravos was a mission at which\nLorenzo should do well.\n\n\"The men Lorenzo brings here will not know my name or my face,\" he went\non. \"In a few days Cardinal Ugolini will take me before the pope, and I\nwill warn him against the Tartars from my own true experience of them.\nI must not be connected with other things done against the Tartars,\ndisturbances among the people, armed attacks. That is why Rachel is such\na danger.\"\n\nShe had been looking thoughtfully at the pebbled path. When he spoke\nRachel's name, she lifted her head to stare at him.\n\n\"Are you going to make me give up Rachel?\"\n\nThat annoyed him. \"You agreed. Have you forgotten?\"\n\n\"No, but I thought now that she has been with us awhile and there has\nbeen no trouble, you might change your mind.\"\n\n\"I do not change my mind so easily.\" By God, working with this woman was\nan ordeal. She argued and complained far too much. He wondered whether\nshowing their faces in public made Christian women overbold.\n\n\"But where can she go? You would not really cast her out to starve.\"\n\n\"Tilia Caballo will take her in.\"\n\n\"You will force her into that horrible fat woman's brothel? And she only\na child?\"\n\n\"She is nearly thirteen. Many women are married by then.\"\n\n\"She has not even started bleeding yet.\"\n\n\"How do you know that?\" Daoud felt somewhat embarrassed.\n\n\"She told me, of course.\"\n\n\"She need only be a serving girl at Tilia's.\"\n\n\"No doubt Tilia would find her too precious a commodity _not_ to be\nsold. There are old men who would give that woman her own weight in gold\nto get their hands on an intact virgin child. And these high churchmen\ncan afford it.\"\n\nDaoud remembered the rough hands of the first Turks who captured him and\nshuddered inside himself. \"She does not have to lie with men unless she\nchooses that life.\"\n\n\"Do you really think you and Tilia would be giving her a choice?\" said\nSophia angrily.\n\nAgain Daoud's feelings struggled against each other. He liked the way\nshe spoke up fiercely for the child. Yet it angered him that she was\nmaking it harder for him to deal with the painful problem of Rachel.\n\n\"How much choice is anyone in this world given?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Are you not here by choice, David?\"\n\n\"I am the slave of my sultan,\" he said. \"That is what the word\n_Mameluke_ means--slave. He sent me here. But I am also here by choice.\"\n\n\"To save Islam from the Tartars.\" She reached her fingertips into the\nwater and dabbed the droplets on her forehead.\n\nHe caught the note of skepticism in her voice. \"Yes. Do you not believe\nthat?\"\n\n\"Can you see yourself through my eyes?\" There was an earnestness in her\nface, as if she badly wanted not to doubt him.\n\n\"No, how do you see me?\" he asked gently.\n\n\"I see a Frankish warrior, fair of hair and face.\" She turned and looked\ndirectly at him, then quickly cast her eyes down. \"Good looking enough,\nfor a Frank.\" She gestured toward his knee, encased in scarlet silk.\n\"You show a handsome leg in your new hose.\"\n\n_Why, she cares for me!_ He felt a little leap of delight, and reminded\nhimself that he must not let himself be drawn to Sophia.\n\n\"You and the Turks call all men from western Europe Franks,\" he said.\n\"But my parents were not from France, but of English descent.\"\n\n\"You could go back to France or England with your jewels and buy a\ncastle and lands and an army of retainers and live like a little king.\nAnd forget all about Islam and the Tartars.\"\n\nHe did not want to argue with her. He wanted to reach out and touch her\nlips with his fingertips.\n\n\"I consider myself blessed by God to have been raised amid the glories\nof Egypt rather than in ignorance and dirt among those you call Franks.\"\n\nShe nodded. \"We Greeks think the people of Arabia and Egypt are the only\nother civilized people in the world. Almost as civilized as we Greeks.\"\nShe said the last with a smile, and he noticed that her cheeks dimpled.\n\nHe laughed. \"What makes you so civilized?\"\n\nShe clasped her hands between her knees and cast her eyes upward as if\nin deep thought. \"Ah, well, our churches are huge and magnificent.\"\n\n\"So are our mosques.\"\n\n\"Our paintings and mosaics and statues of saints and angels and emperors\nare the most beautiful in the world.\"\n\n\"Idols,\" he interrupted, but he turned to her and smiled as she had.\n\"The Prophet ordered idols destroyed.\"\n\n\"And therefore the art of painting languishes among you,\" she said,\npoking her forefinger into his shoulder. \"Someday I will show you my\npaintings if you promise not to destroy them.\"\n\nHis shoulder tingled where she had touched him. She must have been\ncarried away by her feelings about the arts of her homeland to make such\na gesture. Surely it could not have been deliberate. His hand rested\nbetween them on the edge of the fountain. He moved a bit closer to her\nso that the edge of his hand nearly touched her thigh.\n\nHe nodded. \"I will teach you the art of calligraphy as my Sufi master\npracticed it, and save your soul.\"\n\n_I would really like to do that. Ah, but I cannot teach her to write\nArabic. What if someone were to see her practice work?_\n\nHe sighed inwardly.\n\n\"Hm,\" she grunted. \"I doubt that _you_ can save _my_ soul. But as for\nwriting, we are familiar with dramatists like Sophocles, philosophers\nlike Aristotle. We read Latin poets like Ovid, whose book I just gave to\nRachel. Here in his native Italy his work is thought licentious.\"\n\n\"I have read Aristotle and Plato in Arabic,\" he said. \"And I have no\ndoubt our Persian poets sing as gloriously as your Greeks and Latins.\nAnd for licentious tales, those told in our bazaars would turn your\ncheeks bright red.\"\n\nThose cheeks were a smooth cream color, he observed. He looked about\nhim. There was no one but himself and Sophia in the atrium. A\nmultistoried gallery lined with columns and arches ran around all four\nsides of the central courtyard. There might be servants, spies for the\ncardinal, watching them, but he could see no one on any of the levels.\n\n_To the devil with them all._\n\nFor weeks he had been wanting to reach out and touch that unveiled\nbeauty, that ivory skin. Now he did it. Very lightly his fingers\ntraveled from her cheekbone to her jaw.\n\nShe reached up and took his hand--not to remove it, as he had\nmomentarily thought she might, but to hold it briefly against her cheek,\nthen let it go.\n\nThey sat silently looking at each other. She was so still that she\nseemed not even to breathe, while he discovered that his heart was\nbeating fast and hard. He wanted to kiss her, but not here, where hidden\neyes might be watching.\n\nBut kissing her at all would be a mistake.\n\nThe thought shook him--the realization that he must not get any closer\nto her. He felt as if a rope were tied around his neck and a cruel slave\nmaster had jerked on it.\n\n_She is not for me. She is for my mission._\n\nHe turned away from her.\n\n\"It is better if we do not grow too close,\" he said, fixing his eyes on\na nearby orange tree. \"I must use you. I will send you as my sultan has\nsent me, and you will lie with the man I choose as my quarry.\"\n\nHe looked back and saw that she was smiling sadly, her eyes clouded with\ndisappointment. It pleased him in a bittersweet way to see that she\nshared his unhappiness.\n\n\"I am _your_ slave, then?\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"I do not know whose you are--King Manfred's, I\nsuppose. Or perhaps Emperor Michael's? You have been given to me in\ntrust, like that emerald I brought here from El Kahira--from Cairo. What\nyou will have to do here will be no worse, I am sure, than what you must\nhave had to do before this.\"\n\n\"I am sure.\" There was a dark note in her voice now. He wished he could\ntake back what he said and ease her bitterness, but he had spoken truly,\nand it was needful that she realize it.\n\n\"If you serve me well, I will reward you,\" he promised. \"You will be\nable to do anything in the world you want.\"\n\n\"Of that I cannot be sure,\" she said.\n\nThis time it was he who took her hand and held it tightly for a moment.\nHer hand felt cool and lifeless in his grasp.\n\n\"We may not be lovers,\" he said, \"but perhaps we can be friends.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" she said distantly.\n\nNettled, he rose and left her. If she would not accept him on those\nterms, could he trust her? He turned his back on her and left the\ngarden.\n\nHe longed to know her thoughts. Could she love him? He knew he should\nnot hope for that, because it would have to come to nothing, but he\nhoped she loved him at least a little.\n\nIt was not until he was back in his apartment, about to begin his noon\nprayer, facing the charcoal mark he had made on the wall to point out\nthe direction of Mecca, that he realized what she had done to him.\n\n_Rachel! We settled nothing about Rachel._\n\nHe struck his fist on the wall. He would have to be more careful with\nSophia. She could be very difficult. Even dangerous.\n\n_It is time I had a woman._\n\nWhen a man went without the delights of the bedchamber for too long, he\nbecame too susceptible to the cleverness of beautiful women.\n\nIt had been four months since that last night in El Kahira when his\nwife, Baibars's favorite daughter, Blossoming Reed, had kept him awake\nall night with her devouring love, not caring that he must begin a great\njourney the following day--yes, _because_ he was leaving her.\n\nHe remembered the words she had said to him when she gave him the locket\njust before the battle of the Well of Goliath. _Take for your pleasure\nas many women as you like. But love always and only me. For if you do\nlove another, I promise you that your love will destroy both her and\nyou._\n\nIt would be best if he went to Tilia Caballo's brothel and enjoyed a\nwoman he was not so likely to fall in love with.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDaoud strode through the crowded streets at dusk, enjoying the golden\nlight that fell on the upper stories of the yellow houses of Orvieto.\nHis scarlet cape blew out behind him, and out of the corner of his eye\nhe saw heads turn to follow his passage. He walked close to the houses\non his right, keeping away from the ruts and the rivulets of sewage in\nthe center of the street. Men stepped into the filth, making way for\nhim. He was bigger and better dressed than anyone he met, and a new\nsword with a jeweled hilt swung at his belt. The glances he caught from\nthe short, dark men of Orvieto were not friendly.\n\n_They think I am a Frank, and like Sophia they hate Franks._\n\nPigs rooted in garbage in the quintane, the narrow spaces between the\nhouses. Small dogs ran under his feet. What backward, unsanitary people\nthese Europeans were! The sights and smells of Orvieto made him wish for\nthe paved streets of El Kahira, where every day an army of slaves swept\nand cleared away refuse.\n\nThe cardinal had drawn a map of Orvieto for him, showing the principal\nstreets and the way to Tilia's house. Daoud had committed the map to\nmemory, using the concentration technique Saadi had taught him. Most of\nthe streets had no names. He would have to find his way by landmarks. In\nthe days to come, he planned, he would explore and add to the map in his\nmind until he knew every street in Orvieto.\n\nThe house of Tilia Caballo stood on a street that was wider than most\nat the east end of town. Even though Ugolini had described it as\nordinary-looking, Daoud was surprised to see how much it resembled the\nshabby buildings on either side of it. He had expected some sign of\nluxury, some flamboyance. He had thought to hear music as he approached,\nas he would have outside one of the brothels of El Kahira--before\nBaibars closed them. The house was quiet, unadorned save for a\nthird-floor balcony above the entryway. It gave no sign of who its\noccupants were. He knew it only by counting--fifth house from the\ncorner, Ugolini had said. Unlike the roof of the cardinal's palace,\nwhich was flat, the roof of Tilia's house was sharply peaked.\n\nIt looked like anything but a brothel. And though there were enough\nsmall houses near it to hold two or three hundred people, the street was\nnot crowded, as were streets everywhere else in Orvieto. He saw a few\nmen lounging in doorways, a pair of men walking arm in arm past Tilia's\nfront door, but that was all. Distinguished churchmen and men of wealth\nand good family could come here without attracting notice.\n\n_Even so, I seem to be the only visitor who comes before dusk. Well, if\npeople see me and think I am a well-to-do merchant who frequents\nOrvieto's finest brothel, that is exactly what I want them to think._\n\nHe felt the heaviness in his groin and the lightness in his stomach that\nalways accompanied his visits to women when he had done without pleasure\nfor a long time. He wondered if the Christian courtesan he picked\ntonight would be able to match the accomplishments of the women who\nserved the Mamelukes in El Kahira. She would surely not be able to equal\nthe incredible pleasures he had enjoyed with Blossoming Reed.\n\nHe knocked at the plain dark-brown door, and it swung open immediately,\nas if the one behind it had watched him approach. There stood one of\nTilia's black men, wearing a turban, robes, and pantaloons that for all\nthe world made him look like a harem guard in El Kahira. The costume\nmade Daoud uneasy. The slave bowed in silence, and with a sweep of his\narm bade Daoud enter.\n\nThe entrance hall was a surprise. It seemed much too large for the\nbuilding he had just entered. He stood on a Persian carpet in a wide,\nhigh-ceilinged room filled with light. Candles burned in sconces around\nthe walls and in two chandeliers hanging from the ceiling. Two tall,\nthick candles stood in twisting brass stands the height of a man on\neither side of a marble staircase. A pungent fragrance filled the air,\nand Daoud realized that the candles were scented. If Tilia could afford\nto burn this many candles every night, her trade must be profitable\nindeed.\n\nHe understood now why the interior of Tilia's establishment was so\ndifferent from the exterior. She must have acquired all the buildings\nside by side along this street and then hollowed them out. He noticed\nthat where the walls of the building through which he had entered should\nhave been, there stood marble Roman columns two stories high. Counting\nthe rows of columns stretching right and left, he estimated that this\ngreat hall must be as wide as five of the original houses that had been\nabsorbed into Tilia's mansion.\n\nThe black man struck a large gong beside the door, giving off a low,\nmellow note. Almost immediately Tilia appeared at the top of the\nstaircase. Smiling broadly, she flounced down the steps, the gold and\njewels scattered over her person throwing off sparks in every direction.\n\n\"I knew you would be coming soon, David,\" she said in a low voice. \"I am\nglad you came early in the evening. We can talk freely now. If more of\nmy clients were here, we would have to seclude ourselves.\"\n\nDaoud jerked his head at the black servant. \"Why in God's name do you\ndress your men as Muslims here, where there is so much fear and hatred\nof 'Saracens,' as they call us?\"\n\nTilia laughed, the pillow of flesh under her chin quivering. \"Do you not\nknow that it has long been fashionable among Christians to borrow from\nthe world of Islam? They copy everything from ways of dressing to words\nand ideas. Most people think the Hohenstaufens have gone too far with\ntheir Saracen army, but among the great houses of Italy each must have\nits Moorish servants with great turbans and sashes and pantaloons. And\nhere in Orvieto, the pope's city, it makes my clients feel especially\nwicked to enter a house staffed with slaves so dressed.\"\n\n\"I would not enjoy going into a brothel where the servants were dressed\nlike Christian monks,\" Daoud said scornfully.\n\nTilia sighed. \"I will tell you what seeing these men in Saracen garb\ndoes for me. It reminds me of when I was a young woman in Cairo.\" She\nlooked around at her hall and sighed again. \"Young and beautiful and\nunhappy. Now I am rich and content, but I tell you in all honesty I\nwould give all this up to be young and beautiful.\"\n\nDaoud was surprised. He had not known that Tilia had once lived in El\nKahira. Was that, he wondered, how Baibars came to know her? Was that\nwhy, even though Daoud did not fully trust her, he felt oddly\ncomfortable with her?\n\n\"And where are the young and beautiful and unhappy women in this house,\nthen?\"\n\nShe smiled and laid a hand on his arm. \"Are you here to avail yourself?\"\n\n\"First, I want to send a message to my master. Then that.\"\n\n\"Of course. Come with me.\"\n\nHe followed her up the marble steps, idly wondering if her rump looked\nas huge with her gown off, and whether Cardinal Ugolini actually did go\nto bed with her, and if so how he could be aroused by such a grossly fat\nwoman. Not that Ugolini, with his rodent's face, was any more attractive\nthan his mistress.\n\nThe stairs to the third floor were narrower and darker and more winding,\nand after that there was a maze of corridors to negotiate. Even with the\nhelp of the Sufi mental training for warriors, Daoud knew he would never\nbe able to find his way here again.\n\nTilia gestured to a trapdoor. \"Push that back for me.\"\n\nDaoud climbed a ladder, raised the heavy door, and found himself on a\nwalkway built over the centerline of a roof. It was wide enough for two\nmen to stand side by side, but there was no railing, and on either side\nthe red-tiled roof sloped down sharply. The walkway led to a small\nstructure made of wooden slats, from which Daoud heard fluttering and\ncooing. The sight of the dovecote and the sound of the warbling pigeons\nreminded Daoud of the rooftops of El Kahira, and for a moment he yearned\nfor a sight of the Bhar al-Nil flowing swiftly past the city or the\nsound of the muezzin's call to prayer.\n\nHe stopped to look around. This was an excellent vantage point. From\nhere he could see that Tilia's mansion was actually shaped like\nUgolini's, a hollow square around an atrium. The difference was that her\nestablishment was made from the joining of many houses that had once\nbeen separate. From here he could also see most of Orvieto. Rows and\nrows of peaked roofs glowed warm red and orange in the sunset. Off in\nthe northwest corner of the city bulked the great roof of the cathedral,\nlike a galley among rowboats. To the south, the six square turrets of\nthe pope's palace. And on all sides of the city, the rounded green hills\nof this part of Italy called Umbria.\n\n\"The piccioni fly to Napoli,\" said Tilia breathlessly behind him. Daoud\nwas amazed at how she had managed to climb so many steps and finally a\nladder. There must be muscle under all that fat.\n\nHe pulled open the whitewashed wooden door of the dovecote. His entry\nset off a furious flapping of wings, unleashing a storm of feathers in\nthe dark enclosure. The smell of pigeon droppings was heavy in the warm\nair. He began breathing through his mouth to keep the odor out of his\nnose. Tilia pushed past him, whistling and clucking to the pigeons and\ncalming them down.\n\n\"Who gets the messages in Napoli?\" he asked.\n\nShe turned to him with a smile. \"Another brothel keeper. A man. I will\nnot tell you his name. The wives of my piccioni live in his dovecote.\nWhen I release a piccione here, he flies to Napoli and visits with his\nwife until one of my servants rides there and brings him back. Piccioni\nare much more faithful to their mates than men and women.\"\n\nDaoud laughed. He enjoyed Tilia's cynicism. The strong light of the\nsetting sun fell in bars through the slats across her face and body.\n\n\"How long does it take for the messages to reach El Kahira?\"\n\nShe looked at him as if he were a simpleton. \"Who can say? From Napoli\nsomeone must take the message capsules aboard a ship to a port in\nOutremer. So, how long it takes depends on whether the sea is angry or\ncalm. Once in Outremer they might go on by piccioni again or by camel\ncaravan. Once I had a reply within two months. The longest I had to wait\nwas a year and three months.\" She had, Daoud noted, the brothel keeper's\ngood memory for numbers.\n\n\"May this arrive sooner than that.\" Daoud reached into a leather scrip\nat his belt and drew out the two rolled slips of parchment, each crowded\nwith tiny Arabic characters.\n\n\"Two letters? Where is the other one going?\"\n\n\"Both to Baibars. They are duplicates. We do that in the field whenever\npossible. Twice as much chance that the message will get through.\"\n\n\"I will send one tonight and the other tomorrow morning. What are you\ntelling him?\"\n\nDaoud was not sure Tilia should be asking him that. But as \"Morgiana\"\nshe had sent Baibars dozens of long letters from Orvieto. Surely no one\nhad a better right to know about this correspondence.\n\nDaoud shrugged. \"That I have arrived here safely with two companions\nsent with me by King Manfred, and that we have been welcomed by the one\nwho was awaiting me. Even though this is written in a cipher, your name\nand the cardinal's name are not mentioned. I go on to say that we have\nstirred up the people of Orvieto against the Tartars and that I will\nsoon speak against them before the pope. And I tell him something of\nwhat I have learned about Italy. He is very curious about the lands of\nthe infidel.\"\n\n\"The cardinal has agreed to present you to Pope Urban, then?\" Her\neyebrows twitched and her mouth tightened.\n\nHer look of displeasure irritated him. For all he knew, it was her\ninfluence that made Ugolini so difficult. But, he thought with grudging\nadmiration, she herself seemed more resolute than the cardinal.\n\n\"He came to see that it was the only course open to us.\"\n\n\"You are persuasive. I see better why your master sent you.\" She took\nthe parchments from him, rolled them even tighter, and tied each one\ninto a tiny leather capsule. One capsule disappeared into a jeweled\npurse that hung on her hip. The other she put aside while she reached\ninto a cage, whistling and twittering. Her hand came out again grasping\na pigeon.\n\n\"This is Tonio. He is ten years old. He always gets through.\" Daoud was\namazed at how calmly the pigeon reposed in Tilia's hand. He was even\nmore surprised when she handed the bird to him, but he quickly took him,\nholding him around the back with thumb and forefinger behind his head,\nleaving his chest free so he could breathe easily.\n\n\"You've handled birds before,\" she said, deftly fastening a capsule\nunder Tonio's wing. She took the bird back from Daoud. Outside the coop,\nshe opened her hands and the bird took off with a fanning of wings.\n\n\"There now,\" said Tilia. \"With that out of the way, perhaps you would\nlike a piccione of another sort for your pleasure.\"\n\n\"I would indeed,\" said Daoud, feeling a warmth spread through his body.\n\n\"I have just the one for you,\" Tilia said, patting him on the arm as\nthey returned to the trap door. \"Her name is Francesca. She is\nbeautiful, warm-hearted, and very discreet. She will serve you supper,\nand if you like her, you may spend the night with her. And you need pay\nme nothing.\"\n\n\"You are too generous, Madama,\" said Daoud, recovering from a small\nsurprise. He had assumed that Tilia would give him access to her women\nout of simple hospitality, and it had never occurred to him that he\nwould have to pay.\n\n\n\n\nXIII\n\n\nSimon stood shifting from foot to foot in the graveled yard before the\npalace of Pope Urban. An Italian cardinal had just arrived with his\nretinue of bishops, monsignori, priests, and monks, and Simon knew it\nwould be some time before the procession passed all the guards and the\nmajordomo at the main door.\n\nAlain de Pirenne, beside him, said in a low voice, \"I still can't\nbelieve it. We are about to attend a council called by the pope\nhimself.\" His blue eyes were huge, and his fair skin was flushed with\nexcitement. He was dressed in his best, an azure tunic with silver\nembroidery at the sleeves and collar, and on his feet poulaines, black\ndeerskin shoes whose elongated toes came to points. The hilt of the\nlongsword hanging at his waist was plain, but Simon knew it had been in\nthe Pirenne family for generations.\n\n\"Do not believe it yet, Alain,\" Simon said wryly. \"We were not invited,\nand we have not yet been let in.\"\n\n\"Surely they would not keep out so great a seigneur as you,\" said Alain.\n\"Especially when you have been faithfully protecting the Tartars for a\nmonth.\"\n\n\"Well, that is what I am counting on,\" Simon said.\n\nThey stood inside a high wall of cream-colored tufa, the same rock on\nwhich Orvieto stood. The wall, topped with square battlements,\nsurrounded the papal palace. Simon's gaze swept beyond the wall toward\nthe bluish tops of nearby hills, wreathed in morning mist, then back to\nthe row of pine trees that stood between the wall and the palace, the\nmassed green of the needles almost so dark as to appear black. The\npalace itself, fortified by six square turrets, was of white limestone.\nIt must have cost the papal treasury a fortune, Simon thought, to haul\nall those big blocks up here. Within this solid edifice, surrounded by\nthis high wall, atop the impregnable mesa of Orvieto, the Holy Father\nwas certainly well protected.\n\nThe last monk in his gray gown had passed the guards at the door, and\nSimon saw more clergymen massing at the outer gate. He took a deep\nbreath and started up the stairs, de Pirenne hurrying behind him. He\nreminded himself, _I am the Count de Gobignon_.\n\nHe said as much to the majordomo, who stood before him in white silk\ntunic with the keys of Peter embroidered in black on the left breast.\n\n\"Ah, Your Signory, I saw your brave battle in the cathedral with that\nheretic assassin.\" The majordomo had a prominent upper lip that made him\nlook like a horse. \"A thousand welcomes to the palace of His Holiness. I\nwill be happy to tell him that you are attending the council.\" He showed\nbig yellow teeth in an unctuous grin.\n\nThen his face fell as he looked down at Simon's belt. \"I regret, Your\nSignory, but you may not wear your sword in the palace of the pope. Even\nthough you wielded it most gloriously in His Holiness's service. Only\nthe papal guards may bear arms within. A thousand pardons, but you must\ntake it off. You may leave it with the capitano of the guard if you\nwish.\"\n\nSimon's face burned with embarrassment as he realized he was going to\nhave to disappoint Alain. The scimitar was one of his most precious\npossessions, and he would not entrust it to a stranger, even a stranger\nin the service of the pope. With a sigh he unbuckled his belt and handed\nit, with his dagger and the jewel-handled scimitar, to de Pirenne.\n\n\"If only I had thought to bring Thierry with us,\" he said. \"Forgive me,\nAlain, but would you be good enough to take these back to the Palazzo\nMonaldeschi? Then you can meet me back here.\"\n\n\"Forgive _me_, Your Signory!\" the majordomo interjected. \"I am desolate,\nbut His Holiness himself has commanded that no one is to enter after the\ncouncil begins.\"\n\nSimon felt angry words forcing their way to his lips. But he clamped his\nmouth shut. This was, after all, the court of the Vicar of Christ on\nearth, and he did not dare protest against its customs. He had the\nreputation of France to think of. These Italians already thought the\nFrench were all barbarians.\n\n\"I knew it was too good to be true,\" de Pirenne said with a rueful smile\nas he turned away. \"I will be waiting for you in the yard outside,\nMonseigneur.\"\n\nSimon shared his friend's unhappiness. This would have been something\nfor Alain to remember for the rest of his life.\n\n\"Bring our horses,\" Simon said. \"We can go riding in the country after\nthe council is over.\" Alain's downcast face brightened at that. Simon\nknew that Alain, born and reared in a country castle, hated being cooped\nup in town.\n\nSimon turned away, feeling dread at having to go into the papal court\nalone.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe great hall of the pope's palace was long, high, narrow, and shadowy.\nEven though it was a sunny day outside, the small windows of white glass\non both sides of the room admitted insufficient light, and had to be\nsupplemented by a double row of three-tiered chandeliers, each bearing\ndozens of candles. The pope could have saved himself the cost of a great\nmany candles, Simon thought, if he had built his great hall in the new\nstyle, like the king's palace in Paris, with buttresses that allowed for\nmuch larger windows.\n\nBut this was Italy, he reminded himself, where there was war in the city\nstreets, even war against the pope. Large glass windows would offer poor\nprotection. The King of France did not have such worries.\n\nAt the far end of the room a long flight of marble steps swept up to an\nenormous gilded throne, empty at present. Down the center of the steps\nran a purple carpet, and over the carpet lay a wide strip of white\nlinen.\n\nTwo rows of high-backed pews faced each other on either side of the\nthrone. Between them was a table laid with rolls of parchment, an\ninkstand, and a sheaf of quills. The pews were as yet empty, but around\nthem stood cardinals in bright red robes with flat, broad-brimmed red\nhats--some of them Simon remembered seeing at the cathedral two weeks\nbefore. Farther removed from the throne and more numerous were the\npurple-robed archbishops and bishops. Scattered around the hall were\npriests, monks, and friars in black, white, brown, and gray. There must\nbe nearly a hundred men in the room, Simon guessed. The air was filled\nwith a buzz of conversation.\n\nHe felt the hollow in his stomach and the trembling in his knees that\ndisturbed him whenever he entered a roomful of strangers. And these\nstrangers were, most of them, the spiritual lords of the Church. He\nlooked for a place where he could stand inconspicuously. He dared not\nspeak to anyone. He felt as if a frown from one of these men would be\nenough to send him into disordered retreat.\n\nAnd suddenly before him there was the frowning face of Cardinal Paulus\nde Verceuil. The wide red hat with its heavy tassels seemed precariously\nbalanced on his head. His gold pectoral cross was set with emeralds and\nrubies. The buttons that ran down the front of his scarlet cassock,\nSimon noticed, were embroidered with gold thread.\n\n\"What the devil are you doing here?\"\n\nSimon cast about wildly in his mind for a sensible answer. Nothing he\ncould say, he was sure, would win this cardinal's approval.\n\n\"I--I feel it is important that I know what is decided here, Your\nEminence.\"\n\n\"These deliberations are no business of yours. Your duty is to protect\nthe ambassadors. You have deserted your post.\"\n\nStung, Simon wished de Verceuil were not an ordained priest and a prince\nof the Church, so that he could challenge him. That he could do nothing\nabout de Verceuil's accusation infuriated him.\n\n\"The Tartars are safely at the Monaldeschi palace guarded by all of our\nknights and men-at-arms. When Count Charles d'Anjou laid this task upon\nme, I understood that I was to help advance the alliance with the\nTartars. I cannot do that if I am kept in ignorance.\" After a pause he\nadded, \"Your Eminence.\"\n\nThat was almost as good as a challenge. Simon felt light-headed, and his\nlimbs tingled. He wanted to raise his arms and shake his fists.\n\nDe Verceuil's face turned a deep maroon, but before he could speak, a\nfigure also in cardinal's red appeared beside them.\n\n\"Paulus de Verceuil! Is this not the young Count de Gobignon, Peer of\nthe Realm? You are remiss, mon ami. You should have realized that the\nFrench cardinals here in Orvieto would wish to meet one of France's\ngreatest barons.\"\n\nThis cardinal had a long black beard, and eyes set in deep hollows. He\ncould easily have presented a dour figure, but stood smiling with his\nhands clasped over a broad stomach.\n\nDe Verceuil took several deep breaths, and his cheeks returned to their\nnormal color. \"Monseigneur the Cardinal Guy le Gros, I present the Count\nSimon de Gobignon,\" he said in a sour monotone.\n\nSimon immediately dropped to one knee and bent his head toward the ring\nthe cardinal held out to him. The stone, as big as Cardinal le Gros's\nknuckle, was a spherical, polished sapphire with a cross-shaped\nfour-pointed star glowing in its center. Holding the cardinal's cold,\nsoft hand, Simon touched the gem lightly with his lips.\n\n_I believe I am supposed to gain an indulgence from kissing this ring_,\nhe thought. He rose to his feet. He tried to remember what he knew about\nGuy le Gros. He had heard a bit about each of the fourteen French\ncardinals. Le Gros, he recalled, had been a knight and a prominent\nlawyer, ultimately a member of the king's cabinet. Then he had joined\nthe clergy. He had been the first cardinal elevated by Pope Urban.\n\n\"Doubtless you knew Count Simon's late father,\" said de Verceuil to le\nGros. \"Since you served as a counselor to the king.\"\n\nSimon wanted to shrink out of sight at the reminder of Amalric de\nGobignon. De Verceuil had mentioned him out of deliberate cruelty, Simon\nwas certain. He felt even more crushed when he saw the pained look that\npassed briefly over Cardinal le Gros's features.\n\n\"Oh, yes, I met your father many years ago,\" said le Gros, his light\ntone reassuring Simon a bit. \"He was a tall man like you, but blond, as\nI recall.\"\n\nThe suggestion that he did not resemble Amalric de Gobignon chilled\nSimon.\n\n\"As a father of unmarried daughters, Cardinal le Gros,\" de Verceuil\nsaid, \"you might be interested to know that the count has no wife.\"\n\nLe Gros shrugged and smiled at Simon. \"His Eminence never misses an\nopportunity to remind me that I was once a family man. Perhaps Paulus\nenvies my wider experience of life.\"\n\n\"Not at all!\" de Verceuil protested.\n\n\"Or perhaps he thinks it a scandal that a cardinal should have\ndaughters,\" said le Gros, still addressing Simon. \"At least mine are\nlegitimate, unlike the offspring of certain other princes of the Church.\nAs for the high office, it was not my choice. His Holiness commanded\nme.\" He leaned confidentially toward Simon. \"He needed more French\ncardinals. He cannot trust the Italians to support him against the\naccursed Manfred von Hohenstaufen.\"\n\n\"Even more than that, he was hoping you could persuade King Louis to\ngive his brother Charles permission to fight Manfred,\" said de Verceuil.\n\"You failed him in that.\"\n\n\"That case is not closed,\" said le Gros. \"Indeed, what we do here today\nmay lead directly to the overthrow of the odious Manfred, as I am sure\nyou both understand.\" He smiled, first at Simon, then at de Verceuil.\n\"But should we not be speaking Latin, the mother tongue of the Church?\nSome lupus might be spying on us.\"\n\nIn Latin de Verceuil answered, \"I fear Count Simon would be unable to\nfollow us.\"\n\n\"Not at all, domini mei,\" Simon cut in quickly, also in Latin. \"I have\nhad some instruction in that language.\" His many and often quarreling\nguardians had agreed at least that he should have an education far\nsuperior to that of most other great barons. Having studied for two\nyears at the University of Paris, Simon had once been the victim of a\nlupus, a wolf, an informer who reported students for breaking the\nuniversity rule that Latin must be spoken at all times. The fine he paid\nwas negligible, but his embarrassment was keen.\n\n\"Good for you, my boy,\" said le Gros, patting him lightly on the\nshoulder. De Verceuil's lips puckered as if he had been sucking on a\nlemon.\n\nA sudden blast of trumpets silenced the conversation in the hall.\nServants swung open double doors near the papal throne, and two men\nentered. One was Pope Urban, whom Simon had not seen since the day of\nthat ill-omened papal mass for the Tartar ambassadors. His white beard\nfanned in wispy locks over his chest. The mouth framed by his beard was\ncompressed, and his eyes were hard. Simon knew that he had been born\nJacques Pantaleone at Troyes in France, not far from Gobignon, and was a\nshoemaker's son. Only in the Church could a man from such a humble\nbeginning rise to such high position. Urban had the face of a man who\ncould cut the toughest leather to his pattern.\n\nAge had bent the pope somewhat, and he leaned on the shoulder of a man\nwho walked beside him. This man was so unusual a figure that he drew\nSimon's attention away from Pope Urban. Like the Holy Father, he was\nwearing white, but it was the white robe of a Dominican friar, and it\ncurved out around his belly like the sail of a galley with the wind\nbehind it. He was partially bald, his face round as a full moon, and his\neyes, nose, and mouth were half buried in flesh the sallow color of new\nwheat. He nodded repeatedly in response to something the pope was\nearnestly saying to him.\n\n\"Who is _that_?\" Simon whispered, earning himself a black look from de\nVerceuil.\n\n\"Fra Tomasso d'Aquino,\" said Cardinal le Gros. \"I am told he is the\nwisest man alive. Papa Pantaleone has appointed him to conduct this\ninquiry, unfortunately.\"\n\n\"Why unfortunately, dominus meus?\"\n\n\"Bad enough for us that d'Aquino is Italian, he is also a relative of\nthe Hohenstaufens. His older brothers have served both Frederic and\nManfred.\"\n\n\"A relative of the Hohenstaufens!\" de Verceuil exclaimed loud enough for\ntwo nearby bishops to turn and stare at him. \"How can His Holiness trust\nsuch a man?\"\n\n\"Fra Tomasso is not _that_ close a relative,\" said le Gros. \"Papa\nPantaleone hates the Hohenstaufens more than anyone. Have they not\nforced him to immure himself here in the hills, when he should by rights\nbe reigning in Rome? And yet he favors Aquino because Aquino is loyal to\nthe Church and well informed. Come, let us find our seats.\" They walked\ntogether toward the pews near the papal throne.\n\nAnd Simon was suddenly standing alone at the back of the congregation.\n\nStanding at the foot of the steps leading up to his throne, Pope Urban\nturned, smiled, and spread his hands in benediction. He intoned a prayer\nbeginning, \"Dominus Deus,\" very rapidly in Latin and followed with\ngreetings to all present. He mentioned each cardinal, archbishop, and\nbishop by name, then several distinguished abbots and monsignori. His\nwhite beard fluttered as he spoke.\n\nThen Simon heard, \"And we greet with joy our countryman, Simon, Count de\nGobignon, who bears one of France's most ancient and honored names.\"\n\nA stunning brightness blinded Simon, as if lightning had struck right in\nfront of him. _Ancient and honored!_ In front of so many leaders of the\nChurch. If at this moment some hidden enemy were to shoot an arrow at\nthe pope, Simon would have leapt to take it in his own breast with joy.\n\n_What magnanimity!_ Simon thought. He remembered the majordomo saying he\nwould tell the pope Simon was there. He looked to see how de Verceuil\nhad reacted to the pope's singling him out, but the cardinal was hidden\nsomewhere in the rows of red-hatted figures lined up in their pews on\neither side of the pope. Simon noticed other prelates staring at him,\nthen turning away as he looked at them, and his face went hot.\n\nMeanwhile the pope was talking about the Tartars. \"We must soon decide\nwhether it be God's will that Christian princes join with the Tartars\nand aid them in their war against the Saracens, or whether we should\nforbid this alliance with pagans. We shall have a private audience later\nthis week with the two ambassadors from Tartary. But today we ask your\ncounsel. So that all may speak freely, we have expressly not invited the\nTartar emissaries. We ask God to help us make a wise decision.\" He\nintroduced Fra Tomasso d'Aquino.\n\nTo Simon's surprise, Pope Urban did not then ascend to his throne but\ninstead came down, disappearing into the midst of his counselors. The\ncardinals sat in their pews. The lesser dignitaries sat on smaller\nchairs in rows facing the throne. When everyone was in place, Simon\ncould see Pope Urban in a tall oaken chair at the foot of the steps.\n\nThere was no chair for Simon, even though the pope had greeted him by\nname. No matter, many of the lesser clergy also remained standing. He\npressed forward through the crowd until he was just behind the seated\nmen so that he could see and hear better.\n\nThe corpulent Fra Tomasso took his place behind the table in a heavy\nchair wider than the pope's, though its back was not as high. He called\nfor Cardinal Adelberto Ugolini. The cardinal, a tiny man with flowing\nside whiskers and a receding chin, stood up at his place in the pews. He\nin turn summoned from the audience a knight called Sire Cosmas.\n\nSire Cosmas, an elderly man, walked stiffly to the pope and knelt before\nhim. Ugolini told the assembly that Cosmas had seen and fought the\nTartar invaders in his native Hungary and was driven from his home by\nthem.\n\n_The Tartars have long since withdrawn from Hungary_, Simon thought.\n_Why did Sire Cosmas never go back there?_\n\nSire Cosmas was lean and dark, with gray hair that fell to his\nshoulders. Over scarlet gloves he wore many rings that flashed as he\ngestured.\n\n\"They came without warning and all at once, like a summer cloudburst,\"\nthe Hungarian said. \"One moment we were at peace, the next the lines of\nTartar horsemen darkened the eastern horizon from the Baltic to the\nAdriatic.\"\n\nSire Cosmas's Latin was very good, fast and fluent.\n\nSimon stood transfixed as Cosmas described the fall of one Russian city\nafter another, how the Tartars leveled Riazan, Moscow, and Kiev and\nbutchered all their people. They would gather all the women, rape them,\nand cut their throats. The men they cut in two, impaled on stakes,\nroasted, flayed alive, used as archery targets, or suffocated by\npounding dirt down their throats. The details of the atrocities sickened\nSimon. On into Poland the Tartars came.\n\nCosmas's tale of the trumpeter of Krakow, who kept sounding the alarm\nfrom the cathedral tower until Tartar arrows struck him down, brought\ntears to Simon's eyes.\n\nSimon found the Hungarian's recital spellbinding. Cosmas had undoubtedly\nrepeated his account many times, polishing his storytelling skills a\nlittle more with each occasion. It was probably easy and perhaps\nprofitable for him to remain in western Europe telling and retelling, in\ngreat halls and at dinner tables, his adventures with the Tartars.\n\n_How much is Cardinal Ugolini paying him for this performance?_\n\nThe flower of European chivalry engaged the Tartars at Liegnitz in\nPoland, Sire Cosmas said, and when the battle was over, thousands of\nknights from Hungary, Poland, Germany, Italy, France, England, and as\nfar away as Spain lay dead and dying on the field and the Tartars were\ntriumphant. They turned then to meet another mighty Christian army, that\nof King Bela of Hungary, at Mohi.\n\n\"I fought in that battle,\" Cosmas declared. \"The dog-faced Tartars\nbombarded us with terrible weapons that burst into flame and gave off\npoisonous smoke, so that men died of breathing it. We advanced against\nthem and discovered that we were surrounded. Their pitiless volleys of\narrows slowly reduced our numbers all that long day. In the late\nafternoon we saw their columns gathering for a charge, but we also saw a\ngap in their line. Many of us, myself among them, rushed for that gap,\nthrowing down our arms and armor so we could escape more quickly. It was\na devilish trick. The Tartar heavy cavalry fell upon those who remained\nbehind, now few in number, and slaughtered all. The light cavalry rode\nalong the flanks of those who retreated, shooting them down till bodies\nin their thousands littered the road. I was one of the few who, by God's\ngrace and by feigning death, lived.\"\n\nThe Tartars advanced to the Danube, he went on, burning everything,\nkilling all the people in towns and villages. They burned Pest to the\nground. On Christmas Day in the year 1241 the Danube froze hard. The\nTartars crossed and destroyed Buda. They advanced into Austria. Tartar\ncolumns were sighted from the walls of Vienna. Europe lay helpless\nbefore them.\n\n\"Only the hand of God saved us. He willed that at that very moment the\nemperor of the Tartars in their far-off homeland should die,\" Sire\nCosmas concluded. \"All the kings and generals of the Tartars had to\ndepart from Europe, with their armies, to choose their next emperor.\nThose parts of Poland and Hungary they had occupied, they left a dead,\nsilent desert.\n\n\"Since then the Tartars have made war on the Saracens, which pleases us,\nof course. But is the enemy of our enemy truly our friend? Permit me to\ndoubt it, good Fathers. We are no better able to fight the Tartars now\nthan we were after Mohi. I urge you to let the Tartars and Saracens wear\nthemselves out fighting each other. Let us not help the Tartars with\ntheir distant wars, losing knights and men we might later need to defend\nEurope against those devils themselves.\"\n\nSire Cosmas's words chilled Simon. He felt himself almost persuaded that\nthe Tartars were a menace to the world. It might be a grave error to\nwork for an alliance with them. And yet, for the sake of his family he\nhad accepted this mission. He could not back down now. Uneasily he\nrubbed his damp palms on his tunic.\n\nThere was a murmur of conversation as Sire Cosmas finished and bowed.\n\nFra Tomasso, scribbling notes on a parchment, looked up and asked, \"Did\nyou say that the Tartar soldiers have the faces of dogs, Sire Cosmas?\"\n\nCosmas shook his head, looking himself somewhat sheepish, Simon thought.\n\"We spoke of them so because their pointed fur caps made them look like\ndogs.\"\n\n\"I wondered, because Aristotle writes of men with animals' heads living\nin remote regions,\" said the stout Dominican. He made a note.\n\nCosmas brightened. \"They do eat the flesh of living prisoners. And I\nhope I may not offend your chastity by telling you this, but they slice\noff the breasts of the women they rape and serve them as delicacies to\ntheir princes. Raw.\"\n\nSimon thought of John and Philip and wondered whether they had ever done\nsuch horrible things. He wished he had learned more about the Tartars\nbefore agreeing to pursue this cause.\n\n\"To hear of such deeds is not likely to cause concupiscent movements in\nnormal men,\" said Fra Tomasso dryly. \"Have you seen such abominations\nwith your own eyes?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Cosmas, \"but I heard it from many people when the Tartars\nwere invading us.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said d'Aquino, making another note. He put his quill down\nand started to heave his bulk up from his chair. Cardinal Ugolini darted\npast him, resting his hand momentarily on d'Aquino's shoulder, and the\nDominican settled back down again.\n\nThat cardinal looks just like a fat little mouse, Simon thought. One of\nthe Italians. And it was he who had brought this Sire Cosmas to speak\nagainst the Tartars. He might well be a key opponent of the alliance.\nWhat would it take to change his mind?\n\nUgolini beckoned toward the audience, and a tall blond man came forward\nnow to stand beside him.\n\n_I have seen him before_, Simon thought. _Where?_\n\n\"Holy Fathers,\" said Ugolini, \"Providence sends us this man, David of\nTrebizond, a trader in Cathayan silks. He has traveled in recent years\namong the Tartars. David speaks Greek but not Latin. I will translate\nwhat he says.\"\n\nSimon remembered at last where he had seen David of Trebizond. Standing\non a balcony and looking pleased as the people rioted against the Tartar\nambassadors. And now here to speak against the alliance.\n\nThe back of his neck tingling, Simon thought, _This man is an enemy_.\n\n\n\n\nXIV\n\n\nUgolini spoke in a low voice to the blond man in a language Simon\nguessed was Greek, and David answered at some length.\n\n\"You must suppose now that I am David speaking directly to you,\" said\nUgolini in Latin to the assembly, patting the front of his red satin\nrobe. \"I come from an old merchant family of Trebizond. Caravans from\nacross Turkestan bring us silks from Cathay. We are Christians according\nto the Greek rite.\"\n\nThis provoked a hostile murmur from the audience.\n\nUgolini hesitated, then said, \"I speak in my own person for a moment--I,\ntoo, am inclined to treat as suspect what a so-called Catholic of the\nschismatic Greek Church tells me. But I have talked long with David, and\nI am convinced he is a virtuous man. After all, the Greeks, like us, are\nbelievers in Christ. And Trebizond is at war with Constantinople, so we\ncan trust this man the more for that.\"\n\nAgain David spoke in Greek to Ugolini. Unable to understand David's\nwords, Simon listened to his voice. It was rich and resonant. A virtuous\nman? A traveling mountebank, more likely. He felt a deep distrust of\nboth David and Ugolini.\n\n\"From time to time the Saracens tried to conquer us, but with the grace\nof God we fought them off,\" said David through Ugolini. \"And when we\nwere not at war with them we traded with them, for Trebizond lives by\ntrade. And now that the Tartars have conquered all of Persia, we trade\nwith them.\"\n\nFra Tomasso raised a broad hand and asked, \"Do you find the Tartars\nhonest traders?\"\n\n\"They would rather take what they want by looting or tribute or\ntaxation. Eventually they think they will not have to trade. They\nbelieve the blue sky, which they worship, will permit them to conquer\nthe whole world, and then all peoples will slave for them. Just as they\nuse subject people, so, if you ally yourselves with them, they will use\nyou. You will help them destroy the Moslems, and then they will turn on\nyou.\"\n\n_He hates the Tartars. I can hear it in his voice, see it in the glow in\nhis eyes. He is sincere enough about that._\n\nA cardinal shouted out something in Latin too rapid for Simon to\nunderstand. An archbishop bellowed an answer. Two cardinals were arguing\nloudly in the pews on the other side of the room. Suddenly all the\nChurch leaders seemed to be talking at once. Fra Tomasso picked up a\nlittle bell from his desk and rang it vigorously. Simon could barely\nhear it, and everyone ignored it.\n\n_The princes of the Church quarrel among themselves like ordinary men._\n\nPope Urban stood up and lifted his arms. \"Silence!\" he cried. His voice\nwas shrill and louder than Fra Tomasso's bell. The argument died down.\n\n\"Have you seen the Tartar army in action, Messer David?\" d'Aquino asked.\n\nDavid was silent a long time before answering. His face took on a\nhaunted look. His eyes seemed to gaze at something far away.\n\n\"I was at Baghdad a week after they took it. I came to trade with the\nTartars. There were no other people left in that country to trade with.\nThe Tartar camp was many leagues away from the ruins of Baghdad. They\nhad to move away from the city to escape the smell of the dead. I went\nto Baghdad because I wanted to see. I saw nothing but ashes and corpses\nfor miles and miles. The stink of rotting flesh nearly killed me.\n\n\"I found people who had survived. Those who had not gone mad told me\nwhat had happened. The Tartars commanded the caliph to surrender. He\nsaid he would pay tribute, but he could not surrender his authority to\nthem because he was the spiritual head of Islam.\"\n\nSimon heard murmurs of derision at this, but David ignored them and,\nspeaking through Ugolini, went on.\n\n\"Over a hundred thousand Tartars surrounded Baghdad, and their siege\nmachines began smashing its walls with great rocks brought down from the\nmountains by slave caravans. Soon their standards, which are made of the\nhorns and hides and tails of beasts, were raised over the southeastern\nwall from the Racecourse Gate to the Persian Tower. The city was lost.\nThe Tartars promised to spare the remaining troops if they would\nsurrender. The soldiers of Baghdad went out, unarmed, and the Tartars\nkilled them all with arrows. This is the Tartars' notion of honor.\"\n\n\"They will do the same to us!\" shouted a cardinal. The pope slapped his\npalm loudly on the arm of his chair, and silence settled again.\n\n\"Hulagu Khan, the commander of the Tartar army, now entered the city and\nmade the caliph serve him a splendid dinner. After dinner the khan\ndemanded that the caliph show him all the jewels and gold and silver and\nother treasures that had been gathered by the caliphs of Baghdad over\nthe centuries. Hulagu promised to let the caliph live, together with a\nhundred of his women.\"\n\nThis brought a loud cackle from under one of the red hats in the front\nrow.\n\n\"Only a hundred women!\" a voice followed the laughter. \"Poor caliph! How\nmany was he wont to have?\"\n\n\"Seeing how ugly those Saracens' women are, I would think one wife too\nmany,\" another prelate called out.\n\nIrritated, Simon wished he could silence them all. This was too serious\na matter for such unseemly jokes.\n\nThe ribald jests continued, to Simon's annoyance, until Fra Tomasso\nrang his bell. Then David, looking grimmer than ever, spoke to Ugolini,\nand Ugolini began to address the assembly.\n\n\"Next the Tartars commanded all the people of Baghdad to herd out onto\nthe plain outside the city, telling them that they would be made to\nleave the city only while the Tartars searched it for valuables.\n\n\"When they had the people at their mercy they separated them into three\ngroups, men, women, and children. When families are broken up, the\nmembers do not fight as hard to survive. The Tartars slaughtered them\nwith swords and arrows. Two hundred thousand men, women, and children\nthey killed that day, after promising them they would not be harmed.\"\n\nSimon tried to imagine the butchering of those hundreds of thousands of\npeople. He had never seen any Saracens, and so the victims in his mind's\neye tended to resemble the people of Paris. He shuddered inwardly as he\npictured those countless murders.\n\n\"The Tartars now entered the city whose people were all dead, and sacked\nand burned it. It had been such a great city that it took them seven\ndays to reduce it to ruins.\"\n\nSimon's heart turned to ice.\n\n_What if it were Paris? Could we fight any harder for Paris than the\nSaracens did for Baghdad?_\n\n_Ex Tartari furiosi._\n\n\"They have a superstition that it is bad luck to shed the blood of royal\npersonages. So they took the caliph and his three royal sons, who had\nseen their city destroyed and all their people killed, tied them in\nsacks, and rode their horses over them, trampling them to death.\"\n\n\"These deeds of the Tartars smell sweet in the nostrils of the Lord!\"\nshouted Cardinal de Verceuil. There were cries of approval.\n\nWithout waiting for David to say more, Ugolini replied to de Verceuil.\n\"Yes, Baghdad was the seat of a false religion. But it was also a city\nof philosophers, mathematicians, historians, poets, of colleges,\nhospitals, of wealth, of science, of art. And of two hundred thousand\nsouls, as David has told us. Muslim souls, but souls nevertheless. Now\n_it does not exist_. And whoever thinks that the Tartars will do such\nthings only to Saracen cities is a fool.\"\n\nSimon hated to admit it, but Ugolini's words made perfect sense to him.\n\n\"They will do it everywhere!\" cried someone in the audience.\n\nNow David said through Ugolini, \"What is more, the Tartars who rule in\nRussia have converted to Islam. They still dream of the conquest of\nEurope and may return to the attack at any time. Perhaps while your\narmies are occupied in Egypt or Syria.\"\n\nFra Tomasso raised his quill for attention. \"How would you describe the\ncharacter of the Tartars, Master David? What sort of men are they?\"\n\nDavid answered and then looked about with his bright, compelling gaze\nwhile Ugolini translated. \"I have lived among the Tartars and traveled\nwith them. The Tartar is unmoved by his own pain or by that of his\nfellows. The suffering of other people merely amuses him. His word given\nto a foreigner means nothing to him. He thinks his own race superior to\nall other peoples on earth.\"\n\nFra Tomasso said, \"What you have told us has been most enlightening,\nMaster David, because you have seen with your own eyes. But if your\nempire of Trebizond now trades with the Tartars, how is it that you come\nhere to denounce them?\"\n\n\"I came to Orvieto as a merchant bearing samples of silk from Cathay,\"\nsaid David. \"It is only, as Cardinal Ugolini has said, God's providence\nthat I am here when you are deciding this great question.\"\n\nFra Tomasso turned to Pope Urban. \"Holy Father, is there anything else\nyou wish me to ask?\"\n\nPope Urban shook his head. \"I believe I have heard enough for now. We do\nnot want to sit here all day.\" Smiling, he turned to David. \"Master\nDavid, we thank you for coming all this way to bring us this warning.\"\n\n\"Your Holiness.\" David bowed, a fluid movement that made Simon grunt\nwith distaste.\n\n_Curse the luck! Why is there no one here who knows the Tartars to\nanswer this David? How do we know he is not a liar? A Greek silk\nmerchant is not the sort of person I would trust. He would say anything\nif he thought it would help him sell his wares._\n\nBut doubt cooled Simon's anger. He did not want to admit it, but\nCosmas's and David's tales had frightened him. He thought of the hard,\ncold faces of John and Philip. He _could_ see them beheading women,\nshooting children with arrows.\n\n_Do we want to ally ourselves with such creatures?_\n\nKing Louis did. Count Charles d'Anjou, Uncle Charles, wanted the\nalliance. Simon had agreed to come here. How could he face Uncle\nCharles, what could he say, if he changed his mind?\n\nA lifetime of scorn, that was what lay ahead of him if he were to turn\nback now.\n\nDavid sat stiffly upright, his hands resting on his knees, as Cardinal\nUgolini approached the pope, reaching out in appeal.\n\n\"Holy Father, your predecessor, Clement III of happy memory, declared a\ncrusade against the Tartars after the battle of Mohi. I beg you to sound\nthe alarm again, like that brave trumpeter of Krakow. A Christian prince\nshould no more make a pact with the Tartars than with the devil. Let the\nnations of Christendom be warned in the sternest terms. Let us declare\nexcommunicate any Christian ruler who allies himself with the Tartars.\"\n\nShocked outcries burst from all parts of the hall. Simon went cold. The\nthought of King Louis being excommunicated horrified him. But surely it\nwould not come to that. King Louis was too loyal a Catholic to defy the\npope. But that, then, meant that Simon's mission would fail.\n\nDe Verceuil jumped to his feet. \"You, Ugolini! You should be\nexcommunicated for even suggesting such a thing!\"\n\n\"Cardinal Paulus, you yourself have had much to say out of turn,\" Pope\nUrban said testily. \"I give you leave now to speak in favor of this\nproposed alliance.\"\n\nDe Verceuil took his stand in front of the papal throne, and Ugolini\nreturned to his place in the pews.\n\n_If only the pope favored us more. He is a Frenchman, after all. What\nabout this Manfred von Hohenstaufen? The pope needs French help there.\nBut what a disaster for us that he asks de Verceuil to speak. If any man\ncan turn friends into enemies, it is de Verceuil. We need Friar Mathieu.\nIn God's name, where is he? He could answer this David of Trebizond._\n\nDe Verceuil quickly dismissed the Hungarian's testimony. All that, he\nsaid, happened a generation ago. Today the Tartars would not win such\neasy victories in Europe because we know more about them, and they would\nnot invade Europe again because they know more about us. The Tartars\nhave new leaders since those days, and that is why they have chosen to\nmake war on the Mohammedans. Christian friars have gone among them, and\nmany Tartars have been baptized. The wife of Hulagu Khan is a Christian.\nWherever the khan and his wife travel, they take a Christian chapel\nmounted on a cart, and mass is said for them daily.\n\n\"Yes!\" Ugolini cried from his seat. \"A Nestorian chapel. The khan's\nwife and the other Tartars you call Christians are Nestorian heretics.\"\n\n\"From what I have heard of your dabblings in alchemy and astrology, it\nill behooves you to speak of heresy, Cardinal Ugolini,\" said de Verceuil\ndarkly.\n\nUgolini stood up and advanced on de Verceuil, who was twice his height.\n\"As for Christian friars going among the Tartars\"--he held up a small\nbook--\"let me read--\"\n\nDe Verceuil turned to Pope Urban. \"Holy Father, you have given me leave\nto speak.\"\n\n\"True, but more than once you interrupted him,\" said Urban with a smile.\n\"Let us hear this.\"\n\n\"The Franciscan Friar William of Rubruk, at the command of King Louis of\nFrance, visited the court of the Tartar emperor in Karakorum,\" said\nUgolini. \"This is his account of his travels in that pagan capital. He\nsays the Tartars were so stubborn in their ways that he made not a\nsingle convert.\" He opened to a page marked with a ribbon. \"Here is his\nconclusion, after years among the Tartars--'Were it allowed me, I would\nto the utmost of my power preach war against them throughout the whole\nworld.'\" Ugolini slapped the book shut and sat down, looking triumphant.\n\nDe Verceuil failed to respond immediately. What a poor advocate he was,\nSimon thought. If only Friar Mathieu were here. He, too, was a\nFranciscan like this William of Rubruk, and he might well have the\nanswer to Rubruk's words.\n\n\"Friar William,\" de Verceuil said at last, \"wrote years before the\nTartars conquered Baghdad. As for me, I count myself happy to have heard\nthe words of this merchant from Trebizond.\" He pointed a long finger at\nDavid, who stood in the crowd about twenty feet away from Simon. David\nlooked back at de Verceuil with a rigid face full of raw hatred that\nreminded Simon of what he had read about basilisks.\n\n\"Happy, I say,\" de Verceuil went on, \"to hear every detail of the utter\ndestruction of that center of the Satanic worship of Mohammed. I was\nreminded of the rain of fire and brimstone that wiped out Sodom and\nGomorrah. My heart sang with joy when I heard of the caliph, successor\nof that false prophet, trampled by Tartar horses. I hold that the\nTartars are God's instrument for the final downfall of His enemies. What\nwonderful allies they will make as we liberate the Holy Land from the\nSaracens once and for all!\"\n\n\"And who will liberate the Holy Land from the Tartars?\" a cardinal,\nforgetting his Latin, shouted in Italian.\n\n\"Be still, you fool!\" cried another cardinal in French.\n\nThe Italian advanced on the Frenchman. \"Whoever says 'Thou _fool_!'\"--he\ngave the French cardinal a vicious shove with both hands--\"shall be\nliable to the _judgment_.\" Another shove.\n\nFra Tomasso rang his small bell furiously, but the furious prelates\nignored him.\n\nNow someone had seized the Italian from behind. Simon was shocked,\nhaving never dreamed the leaders of the Church could be so unruly. It\nseemed that anything the French cardinals were for, the Italians were\nagainst. And was the pope, though a Frenchman, likely to approve the\nalliance, with nearly half the cardinals against it? And even if he did,\ncould it succeed in the face of that much opposition?\n\n\"Pax!\" the pope cried, climbing a few steps toward his throne and\nlifting his arms heavenward. \"Peace!\" The angry sound of his voice and\nthe sight of him slowly brought quiet to the hall.\n\nUrban took them to task. The whole future of Christendom might be at\nstake, and they were brawling like university students. Perhaps he\nshould treat them like students and have them whipped. Sheepishly the\ncardinals and bishops took their seats with much rustling of red and\npurple robes.\n\nD'Aquino asked de Verceuil if he had finished. He said he had, and\nSimon's heart sank.\n\n_I promised Uncle Charles I would work to further the alliance. I want\nto believe in it._\n\nBut after listening to Ugolini's two witnesses and de Verceuil's feeble\nattempt to refute them, he was beset by frightening doubts.\n\nHe prayed he would not have to reverse himself. If he changed his colors\nnow and repudiated the alliance, Count Charles might well feel himself\nbetrayed and say that Simon was no better than his father.\n\n\"But did not a Franciscan named\"--the stout Dominican consulted his\nnotes on parchment--\"Mathieu d'Alcon journey from Outremer with these\nTartar ambassadors? Why is he not here to tell us what he knows about\nthem?\"\n\nHope leapt up in Simon's heart. Yes! If they would only hear Friar\nMathieu, that might yet win the day for the alliance.\n\n_And it might help me to feel I am doing the right thing._\n\n\"I assumed, before this august body, my testimony would be sufficient,\"\nsaid de Verceuil with a slight stammer. \"After all, what could a mere\nFranciscan friar add--\"\n\nFra Tomasso raised his eyebrows. \"I remind you, Cardinal, that His\nHoliness has entrusted the conduct of this inquiry to a 'mere\nfriar'--myself. And William of Rubruk, whose book was quoted here today,\nwas a 'mere friar.' Can this Friar Mathieu be found, and quickly?\"\n\nDe Verceuil spread his hands. \"I have no idea where he is, Fra Tomasso.\nHe parted company with us after we arrived in Orvieto and neglected to\ntell us his whereabouts.\"\n\n_A lie!_\n\nFriar Mathieu had told everyone he would be at the Franciscan Hospital\nof Santa Clara. Simon was honor bound to speak out.\n\nStill, it took all his courage to force words through his throat--loud\nwords at that, to make himself heard over the murmur of many\nconversations.\n\n\"Reverend Father!\" he called out, and his heart hammered in terror as\nhundreds of eyes turned toward him, de Verceuil's first of all.\n\"Reverend Father!\"\n\nFra Tomasso turned toward Simon.\n\n\"I know where Friar Mathieu d'Alcon is,\" Simon called.\n\nD'Aquino raised his eyebrows. \"Who are you, young man?\" When Simon\nannounced himself as the Count de Gobignon, Friar Tomasso's smile was\nwelcoming enough to reassure Simon a bit.\n\n\"Friar Mathieu is at the hospital of the Franciscans,\" said Simon. \"He\ntold me he wanted to work there until his services were needed for the\nembassy.\"\n\n\"His services are needed now,\" said d'Aquino. \"Not summoning him here\nwas an oversight.\" He glanced coolly at de Verceuil. \"The hospital is\nnot far away.\"\n\n\"I know where it is, Reverend Father.\" Simon had gone to the hospital to\ninquire about the man shot in the street by the Venetians, he who had\ndied despite Friar Mathieu's urgent efforts.\n\n\"Then have the friar fetched at once, Count, if you please,\" said\nd'Aquino.\n\nSimon shot a quick look at de Verceuil before he turned to leave. The\ncardinal was staring at him, his long face a deep crimson and his eyes\nnarrowed to black slits. Their eyes met, and Simon felt almost as if\nswords had clashed.\n\nWhy was de Verceuil, who wanted the alliance, so angry?\n\n_I know. He wanted to be the authority on the Tartars. He wanted to\ncarry the day for the alliance all by himself._\n\nHard to believe, Simon thought, but it seemed de Verceuil would rather\nsee his cause lost than have someone else win credit for its success.\n\n\"I shall fetch him myself, Fra Tomasso,\" Simon said loudly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTo his relief, he found de Pirenne, expecting an outing in the country,\nwith their two horses just outside the papal palace wall. Simon\nexplained his errand, and together they made the short ride through the\nstone-paved streets to the Franciscan hospital. There the Father\nSuperior hastily summoned Friar Mathieu.\n\nDe Pirenne relinquished his horse to the old Franciscan. Friar Mathieu's\nbare skinny shanks, when he hiked up his robe to sit in the saddle,\nlooked comical to Simon.\n\n\"I knew the Holy Father had called a council today,\" said Friar Mathieu,\n\"but I assumed Cardinal de Verceuil would send for me if I were needed.\"\n\n\"Better to assume that he will do the opposite of what is needed,\" said\nSimon. Friar Mathieu laughed and slapped Simon's shoulder.\n\nThe pope's servants were passing flagons of wine and trays of meat tarts\nwhen Simon and Friar Mathieu entered the hall. The arguments among the\nprelates had risen almost to a roar, but died down as men saw Simon\nescorting the small figure of Mathieu d'Alcon in his threadbare brown\nrobe toward the papal throne.\n\nFra Tomasso spoke softly and respectfully to the elderly Franciscan.\nWhile de Verceuil glowered from the pews, Friar Mathieu stood before the\npope, seeming as serene and self-possessed as if he were in a chapel by\nhimself.\n\n_And why should he not?_ thought Simon. After what Simon had heard about\nthe Tartars today, it seemed to him that anyone who could live for years\namong them could face anything.\n\nD'Aquino quickly summarized what had been said so far. Hearing the\nclarity and simplicity with which the Dominican conveyed the arguments,\nSimon could see why he was thought of as a great teacher and\nphilosopher.\n\n\"I must warn Your Excellencies,\" said Friar Mathieu, \"that if you sent a\nthousand men to journey among the Tartars, you would get a thousand\nreports, each very different. Also, you must keep in mind that the\nTartars are changing so rapidly that what was true of them a year ago\nmay no longer be so today.\n\n\"Italy, France, England, the Holy Roman Empire--all have existed for\nhundreds of years. The Church has carried on Christ's work for over a\nthousand years. This city of Orvieto is even older. But a mere hundred\nyears ago the Tartars were tribes of herdsmen, even simpler than the\nHebrews of Moses' day. Now they rule the largest empire the world has\never seen.\"\n\nHow could such a thing happen, Simon wondered. It seemed almost\nmiraculous. The Tartars must have had the help of God--or the devil.\n\n\"Imagine a baby with the size and strength of a giant,\" Mathieu said\nwith a smile. \"That is what we are dealing with here. Such a gigantic\ninfant might, in a moment of ungoverned anger, kill thousands of people,\ndestroy all manner of precious objects, even sweep away whole cities.\nBut an infant learns rapidly, and so it is with the Tartars. The new\nemperor, or khakhan as they call him, Kublai, reads and writes and\nconverses in many languages. And he does not destroy cities, he builds\nthem. He is the brother of Hulagu, who sent the ambassadors here.\"\n\nSimon began to feel relieved. Friar Mathieu's calm words washed over\nhim, easing his fear that he was doing wrong by supporting the Tartar\nalliance.\n\nFra Tomasso raised a pudgy finger. \"If the Tartars are so powerful and\nare gaining in knowledge, does this not make them even more of a danger\nto Christendom?\"\n\n\"It could,\" said the old Franciscan. \"Let me say, Fra Tomasso--and Holy\nFather\"--with a bow to the pope--\"I can tell you only what I have seen,\nand then with God's help you must judge what is best for Christendom.\"\n\nSimon glanced over at the formidable David of Trebizond, who up to now\nhad been the most expert witness on the Tartars. He stood stiffly,\nstaring at d'Alcon.\n\n_There is a man sore vexed._\n\nAnd de Verceuil, who should have been pleased at having this help,\nlooked just as vexed.\n\n_Friar Mathieu outshines the cardinal, and he is furious._\n\n\"We have been told that the Tartars plan to conquer the whole world,\"\nsaid d'Aquino.\n\n\"For a time they thought they could,\" Friar Mathieu nodded. \"But the\nworld surprised them by going on and on, and now their empire is so huge\nthey cannot hold it together. And they are such innocents, the nations\nthey conquer are destroying them. They die in great numbers of the\ndiseases of cities. In their prairie homeland they were not familiar\nwith the strong wine drunk by farmers and city folk, and now many of\ntheir leaders die untimely deaths of drink. Also, as they grow wealthier\nand more powerful, they fight over the spoils they have taken. When they\ninvaded Europe they were still united, and they were able to throw all\ntheir strength into that war. But now they have broken into four almost\nindependent nations. So divided and extended, they are much less of a\ndanger to Christendom.\"\n\nHow could they hold their empire together, thought Simon, when they had\nbeen nothing but ignorant herdsmen a generation ago? Mathieu's discourse\nmade sense.\n\n\"So,\" said Fra Tomasso, \"we are no longer dealing with a giant, but with\na creature closer to our own size.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mathieu, \"and the proof is that only a few years ago, for\nthe first time anywhere in the world, the Tartars lost a great battle.\nThey were defeated by the Mamelukes of Egypt at a place called the Well\nof Goliath in Syria. If Hulagu's army had won that battle, the Tartars\nwould be in Cairo, and they might be demanding our submission instead of\noffering us an alliance.\"\n\n\"But you think it is safe for us to ally ourselves with them now?\"\n\nFriar Mathieu looked sad and earnest. \"If we and the Tartars make war on\nthe Mamelukes separately, we will be defeated separately. And then, as\nsure as winter follows summer, the Mamelukes will take the few cities\nand castles and bits of land our crusaders still hold in Outremer, and\nall those generations of blood spilled for God and the Holy Sepulchre\nwill have been in vain.\"\n\nNow Simon's relief was total. He felt like singing for joy. He was on\nthe right side after all.\n\nFriar Mathieu stopped speaking and there was silence in the hall.\nGradually the prelates began talking. But there were no shrill outbursts\nfrom those who opposed the alliance. The voices of all were subdued,\nrespectful.\n\nThe pope beckoned Friar Mathieu to his chair and spoke a few words to\nhim, holding him by the arm. The old friar slowly lowered himself to his\nknees, bent and kissed Urban's ring.\n\nFra Tomasso called for silence, and Urban rose and blessed the assembly.\nSimon fell to his knees and crossed himself, thinking, _If I stay here\nvery long, I shall get enough of these papal blessings to absolve me\nfrom punishment for a lifetime of sin._\n\nAccompanied by d'Aquino and a phalanx of priests, the Holy Father left\nthe hall by the side door. The arguments in the hall grew louder.\n\nAs he rose to his feet, Simon saw de Verceuil hurrying toward the front\ndoor, his small mouth tight with anger. A protective impulse made Simon\nlook about for Friar Mathieu.\n\nThere he was, at the center of a small group of friars. Simon started\ntoward him.\n\nA figure blocked his way.\n\nEven though he touched nothing palpable, he stopped as suddenly as if he\nhad run into a wall. And the face he was looking into was hard as\ngranite, eyes alight with the icy glow of diamonds. And yet it was not a\ncold face. There was something burning deep inside there, a fire this\nman kept hidden most of the time. That fire, Simon felt, could destroy\nanything in its path if allowed to blaze forth.\n\nDavid of Trebizond was silent, but as clearly as if he had spoken, Simon\nheard a voice say, _I know you, and you are my enemy. Beware._ Simon\nrealized that David had intended to meet him like this, intended Simon\nto seek the unspoken threat in his eyes.\n\n_He is trying to frighten me_, Simon thought, and was angered. He held\nhis arm still, but he knew that if his sword had been buckled at his\nside, nothing could have stopped him from reaching for it.\n\nSimon looked the broad-shouldered man up and down, taking his measure.\nDavid, half a head shorter than Simon, stood relaxed but imposing, his\nhands hanging at his sides. That a man could appear at once so composed\nand so challenging was unique.\n\n_This man is no trader. It is not just an accident that he has come here\nto speak against the alliance._\n\n_Who and what is he--really?_\n\nSimon drew in a deep breath and said in gruff Italian, \"Let me pass,\nMessere.\"\n\nSlowly, almost insolently, David drew aside. \"Forgive me, Your Signory.\nI was studying your face.\" He spoke Italian with a strange accent. \"I\nthought I might have seen you a long time ago. But that is not possible,\nbecause a long time ago you would have been a child.\"\n\n_What does that mean? Is he trying to remind me that I am younger than\nhe is?_\n\n\"I am sure we have never met, Messere,\" Simon said coldly.\n\n\"Quite right, Your Signory,\" said David. \"But no doubt we will meet\nagain.\"\n\nSimon walked past the man from Trebizond. His back felt terribly\nexposed, and he held his shoulders rigidly. He felt the enmity from\nbehind him as sharp as a dagger's point.\n\n\n\n\nXV\n\n\nSimon guided the black palfrey carefully down the road into the wooded\nvalley west of Orvieto. The path, like the streets of the city, was\ncarved from rock and slippery.\n\nWhen he needed to think, Simon liked to get out of doors, beyond any\nwalls, and to feel a good horse moving under him. It was now a week\nsince the day of the papal council, and its inconclusive outcome\ntroubled him sorely. The pope had repeatedly postponed his audience with\nthe Tartar ambassadors, pleading a sudden excess of phlegm. The Tartars\nwere growing restless, pacing the courtyard of the Palazzo Monaldeschi,\nmuttering to each other angrily and refusing to speak to anyone else.\n\nThe longer the negotiations were delayed, the greater the chance they\nwould fail. The Tartars might even die. Friar Mathieu had said that the\nTartars, coming from a land so distant and so different, were especially\nvulnerable to the diseases of Europe.\n\nCharging de Pirenne and de Puys to keep careful watch over the two\nemissaries, Simon had ridden out into the hills to think what he might\ndo to help his cause along.\n\n_But it is not my place to try to speed things up. My task is to guard\nthe ambassadors, nothing more. If I do only that, I have done my duty._\n\nBut, as he rode out into the valley under the deep shade of huge old\nolive trees, he heard in his mind King Louis's voice.\n\n_And you, too, Simon, must do whatever you can, seize any opportunity,\nto further the cause of the alliance._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKing Louis lay prostrate on the floor of the Sainte Chapelle, his face\nburied in his hands. Simon, impatient to speak to Louis about his\nmission to Italy, knelt on the stone a few paces away from the king's\nlong, black-draped form. The two of them were the entire congregation\nthis morning, far outnumbered by the twelve canons and fourteen\nchaplains chanting the royal mass.\n\nUnable to keep his mind on the mass, Simon kept gazing up at the stained\nglass windows. Since the age of eight, when he had become part of the\nking's household, he had spent hundreds of mornings here in the chapel\nattached to the royal palace, but the building still amazed him. The\nwalls seemed to be all glass, filled with light, glowing with colors\nbright as precious stones. What held the chapel up? Pierre de Montreuil,\nthe king's master builder, had patiently explained the principles of the\nnew architecture to Simon, but though Simon understood the logic of it,\nthe Sainte Chapelle, most beautiful of the twenty-three churches of the\n\u00cele de la Cit\u00e9, still looked miraculous to him.\n\nThe mass ended and the celebrants proceeded down the nave of the chapel\ntwo by two, dividing when they came to King Louis as the Seine divides\nto flow around the Cit\u00e9, each canon and chaplain bowing as he passed the\nprone figure.\n\nWhen they were all gone, King Louis slowly began to push himself to his\nfeet. Simon hurried to help him, gripping his right arm with both hands.\nThe king's arm was thin, but Simon felt muscles like hard ropes moving\nunder his hands. Though almost fifty, the king still, Simon knew,\npracticed with his huge two-handed sword in his garden. Age had not\nweakened him, though a mysterious lifelong ailment sometimes forced him\nto take to his bed.\n\nLouis looked pained. \"This is not one of my good days for walking. Let\nme lean on you.\"\n\nSimon was grateful for the chance to help King Louis. The vest of coarse\nhorsehair that Louis wore next to his body to torment his flesh--as\npenance for what faults, Simon could not imagine--creaked as he\nstraightened up. He put his arm over Simon's shoulder, and Simon passed\nan arm around his narrow waist. He looked down at Simon with round, sad\neyes. His nose was large, but blade-thin, his cheeks sunken in.\n\n\"Let us visit the Crown of Thorns,\" he said, pointing to the front of\nthe chapel, the apse.\n\nLouis was leaning all his weight on Simon as they walked slowly up to\nthe wooden gallery behind the altar where the Crown of Thorns reposed.\nEven so, the king felt light. How could a man be at once so strong and\nso fragile, Simon wondered.\n\nThere was barely room on the circular wooden stairway for them to climb\nside by side. As they stood before the sandalwood chest containing the\nreliquary, Louis took his arm from Simon's shoulders. He took two keys\nfrom the purse at his plain black belt and used one to open the doors of\nthe chest. Inner doors of gold set with jewels blazed in the light from\nthe stained glass windows.\n\nLouis opened the second set of doors with the other key and, with\nSimon's help, knelt. Simon saw within the chest, lined with white satin,\na gold reliquary that contained the Crown of Thorns. It was shaped like\na king's crown and set with pearls and rubies and stood on a gold stem\nand base, like a chalice. Simon was icy-cold with awe, almost terror, at\nthe sight of it. To think that what lay within this gold case had been\nworn by Jesus Christ Himself, twelve centuries ago, at the supreme\nmoment of His life--His death.\n\nStill kneeling, Louis slowly drew the reliquary out of the chest,\nholding it with both hands. His eyes glowed with fervor, as bright as\nthe pearls. Simon prayed he would not open the reliquary. The sight of\nthe actual thorns that pierced Jesus' head would surely be too much to\nbear.\n\nLouis kissed the lid of the case and held it out to Simon.\n\n\"Kiss this relic of Christ's passion, Simon, and beg His blessing on\nyour mission.\"\n\nTrembling, Simon touched his lips to the cool gold surface. Not one\nChristian in a hundred thousand had been this close to the Crown of\nThorns. He felt ashamed, privileged far beyond what he deserved.\n\nAs they walked together out of the chapel, Louis limping and leaning on\nSimon again, said, \"Baldwin, the French emperor of Constantinople, sold\nus two crowns after Michael Paleologos drove him out. I bought the Crown\nof Thorns, and my brother Charles bought the title of emperor of\nConstantinople. Which of us, I wonder, made the better bargain?\"\n\nSimon thought, did Count Charles actually hope to conquer\nConstantinople? And, if so, what did these dealings with the Tartars\nhave to do with it?\n\n\"Is it your wish, Sire, as your brother, Count Charles, has told me,\nthat I should guard the ambassadors from Tartary when they arrive in\nItaly?\" he asked.\n\nLouis stopped walking. They were almost to the doorway of the chapel. He\nturned his round eyes on Simon.\n\n\"Oh, yes, it is very much my wish.\" His thin fingers squeezed Simon's\nshoulder. \"For more than twenty years, ever since I took the crusading\nvow, I have wanted one thing above all else, to win Jerusalem back for\nChristendom. I led an army into Egypt, and it was God's will that the\nMamelukes defeated me.\"\n\n_God's will and Amalric de Gobignon's treachery_, thought Simon.\n\n\"Now, with the help of the Tartars, we could wrest the Holy Land from\nthe Saracens' hands,\" Louis said.\n\n\"But if you wish to ally yourself with the Tartars, Sire, should I not\nbring the ambassadors directly to you instead of to the pope?\"\n\n\"No, I cannot make a treaty with the Tartars without Pope Urban's\npermission. Only the Holy Father can proclaim a crusade. If he refuses\nto do that, I cannot recruit an army to join with the Tartars to rescue\nthe Holy Land. Even if he does declare a crusade, raising an army will\nbe terribly hard. Many of those who went with me last time and endured\nour terrible defeat and survived with God's help have told me they will\nnot go again--or send their sons. I must have His Holiness's full\nsupport.\"\n\nKing Louis turned toward him fully now and put both hands on his\nshoulders. \"You must help me, Simon. I am asking Cardinal Paulus de\nVerceuil to represent the cause of the alliance at the court of the\npope. And Friar Mathieu d'Alcon will be there to testify that the\nTartars may yet be won to Christianity. And you, too, Simon, must do\nwhatever you can, seize any opportunity, to further the cause of the\nalliance.\"\n\nSimon looked into the king's eyes. Their blue was slightly faded, and\nage and care had etched red streaks in the whites. Simon's whole frame\nwas shaken by an overwhelming love for the man.\n\n\"Sire, I will do anything--everything.\"\n\nLouis nodded. \"I know how you have suffered all your life because of the\nill deeds of--one I shall not name. I have tried to shield you from\nbeing unjustly punished. But even a king cannot control the hearts of\nmen. In the end only you can win back for the house of Gobignon its\nplace among the great names of France. This alliance with the Tartars,\nand what follows from it, the liberation of Jerusalem, can help you\nrestore your honor.\"\n\nCould a man have more than one father, Simon wondered. Surely King Louis\nhad done more than anyone else to make him the man he was today.\n\n\"I will work for the alliance, Sire,\" he said. \"Not for my family honor\nalone, but for you.\"\n\nFor King Louis he would guard the Tartars with his life. For King Louis\nhe would do anything.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis horse slowed down to climb as the road rose along a steep slope\nopposite Orvieto, green with vineyards. Friar Mathieu had made a better\nwitness than David of Trebizond, Simon thought. But the Italian\ncardinals remained vociferous in their opposition to the alliance. The\npope might be French, but he had to live with the Italians.\n\nCardinal Ugolini was the key to it. He, it seemed, was the leader of the\nItalian party in the College of Cardinals. He was the cardinal\ncamerlengo, after all.\n\nSomeone must try to reach Ugolini. It could not be de Verceuil, either,\nwith his arrogance and bad manners. Even if the man were to try to talk\nto Ugolini, which was unlikely, he would doubtless make an even greater\nenemy of him.\n\nFriar Mathieu should do it. He could speak to Ugolini as one churchman\nto another. But then Simon shook his head. So many of these princes of\nthe Church looked down on the mendicant friars.\n\n_Seize any opportunity._\n\nSimon rode up the hillside, debating with himself. Just before the road\npassed between two rounded, green-covered peaks, it widened so that\ncarters could pass each other. Simon swung his leg over the saddle and\nstepped down from his horse to enjoy the view. Against the hillside,\nunder a peaked roof, a statue of Saint Sebastian writhed, his body\npierced by arrows. The agony depicted on the saint's face made the\ncountryside look all the more serene.\n\n_Oh, patron saint of archers, let no more harm come to innocent people\nfrom my crossbowmen._\n\nSimon turned to look at Orvieto. It was like a city from some tale of\nfaeries, a fantastic island on its huge rock. What was it the Italians\ncalled that gray-yellow stone? Tufa. Most of the churches and palaces\nand houses of Orvieto were also built of tufa. Beautiful.\n\nThe clatter of hooves interrupted his thoughts. He looked up to see four\nhorsemen approaching from the north, followed by two heavily laden\nbaggage mules.\n\nSimon's mood changed at once from contemplation to tense alertness. His\nhands moved to check the position of his sword and dagger, making sure\nhe could draw them quickly. You had to be careful of strangers in a\nstrange country. As the men rode closer he saw that they also had short\nswords and daggers hanging at their sides. Closer still, and he saw\nlong swords slung over their backs, and crossbows hanging from their\nsaddles.\n\nAnnoyed with himself for feeling afraid, he yet followed the dictate of\nprudence and mounted his own horse. He kept his hand near, but not on,\nthe jeweled hilt of his scimitar as the men rode closer. Highwaymen\nwould be willing to kill him just for that precious sword.\n\nThe man in the lead wore a soft velvet cap that draped down one side of\nhis head. Under it, Simon saw, was curly black hair shot through with\nwhite. The stranger's grizzled mustache was so thick as to hide his\nmouth. But, courteously enough, he touched his hand to his cap where his\nvisor would be if he were wearing a helmet.\n\n\"Buon giorno, Signore,\" he said in a deep but neutral voice.\n\nSimon returned his salutation and the muttered greetings of the others,\nthinking he really should ask who they were, where bound, and on what\nbusiness. In France, especially in his own domains, he would not have\nhesitated. But then, in France he rarely traveled alone. These men\nseemed not bent on troubling him, and it seemed wiser not to trouble\nthem.\n\nThe other three men in the party looked younger than the leader, and\nthere was insolence, almost a challenge in their dark eyes as they\nlooked him over and rode on. It took an effort of will on Simon's part\nnot to move his hand closer to his sword. But he sat stock-still until\nthey were past and on their way down into the valley.\n\nWhat business would bravos like that have in Orvieto? Perhaps they had\ncome to join the Monaldeschi or the Filippeschi in their feuding.\n\nSimon felt beleaguered at the thought of more bravos coming into town.\nOrvieto was already full of armed men serving the local families, as\nwell as others in the retinues of the churchmen who had come here with\nthe pope. Uneasiness made his spine tingle. Anything that added to\ndisorder in Orvieto made it a more dangerous place for the Tartar\nambassadors.\n\n_We must get this question of the alliance settled quickly._\n\nSomeone should speak to Cardinal Ugolini and find out if anything would\npersuade him to withdraw his objections. Simon wondered why de Verceuil\nhad not already attempted it.\n\n_I could meet with Ugolini. He knows who I am. They all do, since the\npope greeted me publicly. All I have to do is send Thierry around with a\nnote asking for an audience._\n\nAt once he began trying to persuade himself to forget the idea. How\ncould he talk a cardinal into changing his mind about such a great\nmatter? Ridiculous! What could he possibly do or say? And what if this\ncardinal were one who knew of the shame of the house of Gobignon?\n\n_Seize any opportunity._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCardinal Ugolini shrugged with his bushy gray eyebrows as well as with\nhis shoulders. \"The question had been thoroughly discussed, Count. Now\nit is up to His Holiness. I am delighted to meet you, but what have you\nand I to say to each other?\"\n\nThe solar, the large-windowed room on the third floor of the cardinal's\npalace, was bright with light that streamed in through white glass. The\nfloor was covered with a thick red and black rug, the walls decorated\nwith frescoes of angels and saints lavishly bedecked with gold leaf.\nSimon's eye kept returning to a voluptuous Eve, no part of her nude body\nhidden by the leaves or branches artists usually deployed for modesty's\nsake. She was handing a golden fruit--it might have been an orange or a\nlemon rather than an apple--to a muscular and also fully displayed Adam.\nSimon found them disturbingly sensual though they dealt with a religious\nsubject, and he was surprised that a cardinal should have such pictures\non his walls.\n\nUgolini's small, elaborately carved oak table, set beside a window, was\npolished and quite bare. There were no books or parchments anywhere in\nthe large room. Simon suspected that the cardinal used this room to\nreceive visitors but did little work in it. A five-pointed star was\ncarved in the back of the cardinal's chair above his head. Simon sat in\na small, armless chair made somewhat comfortable by the cushion on its\nseat.\n\n\"I have come in the hope of presenting to you our French point of view\non this proposed alliance,\" said Simon. That sounded impressive enough.\n\n\"And do you speak for France, young man?\"\n\n\"Not officially, Your Eminence,\" said Simon, flustered. \"I mean only\nthat I _am_ French, and that both King Louis and his brother Count\nCharles d'Anjou have deigned to share their views with me.\"\n\nUgolini leaned forward. His expression was earnest enough, but there was\na twinkle in his eye that gave Simon the uneasy feeling that the\ncardinal was laughing at him.\n\n\"I am eager to hear what you have learned from the king and his\nbrother.\"\n\n\"Quite simply,\" Simon said, \"they look on the advent of the Tartars as a\ngolden opportunity--one might say a God-given opportunity--to do away\nwith the threat of the Saracens once and for all.\"\n\nUgolini nodded thoughtfully. \"So it is not just a question of rescuing\nthe holy places.\"\n\n_Am I giving away something I should not?_ Simon asked himself, suddenly\npanic-stricken. It was Count Charles, he now recalled, who had said that\nthe alliance might make possible the complete destruction of Islam.\n\n_I am in this over my head._\n\nBut he had to go on.\n\n\"The Saracens believe they are called upon to spread their religion by\nthe sword. They will continue to make war on us unless we conquer them.\"\n\nUgolini lifted a finger like a master admonishing a poorly prepared\nstudent. \"The prophet Muhammad calls upon his followers to _defend_\ntheir faith with the sword, but he explicitly states that conversions\nmade at sword's point are worthless and commands that Christians and\nJews who remain devoted to their own worship be left in peace.\" He sat\nback and gazed as happily at Simon as at some well-fed mouse who had the\nwhole granary to himself.\n\n\"I cannot dispute you, Your Eminence. Truly, I am quite ignorant of the\nMohammedan faith.\" Why study false religions?--that had been the\nattitude of his teachers.\n\nUgolini nodded, his side whiskers quivering. \"You and most of Europe.\"\n\n\"But Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Nazareth--those precious places we hear about\nin the Gospel,\" Simon argued. \"We cannot leave them in the hands of\nChrist's enemies.\"\n\nThe cardinal shook his head. \"Christ's enemies! Indeed, you know little\nof them, Count. The Muslim holy book, the Koran, reveres Jesus and His\nmother, Mary. Our sacred places are sacred to them also. Emperor\nFrederic von Hohenstaufen had the right idea. He made a treaty with the\nSaracens. If the crusaders in Syria had not broken it, pilgrims would be\nhappily walking in the footsteps of Our Lord to this day.\"\n\n_Von Hohenstaufen._ Simon remembered the hatred in the voices of de\nVerceuil and le Gros when they spoke of the house of Hohenstaufen.\n\n\"The crusades were a mistake from the very beginning,\" Ugolini went on.\n\nHaving heard harrowing tales from men who had been there of King Louis's\ndisastrous defeat fourteen years before in Egypt, Simon found it hard to\nchallenge Ugolini's assertion.\n\nBut history could not be undone, and with the help of the Tartars, might\nthis not be the one great crusade that would make any more crusades\nunnecessary?\n\n\"We still hold Acre and Tripoli and Antioch and Cyprus,\" Simon said.\n\"The Templars and the Hospitallers have their castles along the coast.\nThink of all the men who have died just to get and keep that much. And\nif we do not beat the Saracens now, they will surely choose their moment\nand take those last footholds of ours.\"\n\nUgolini stood up and walked slowly, red satin robe whispering, to a\nsmall door behind his table. The door was slightly ajar, and Ugolini\nlooked into the next room. Was there someone in there, Simon wondered,\nlistening to this conversation?\n\n_I am getting in deeper and deeper. What if my words could somehow be\nused against me, or against the alliance? I should never have come\nhere._\n\nWhatever he saw beyond the door seemed to satisfy Ugolini. He turned,\nsmiling.\n\n\"Count, I am going to suggest something to you that I am sure will shock\nyou at first: Perhaps we should leave the Holy Land in peace.\"\n\nSimon felt troubled, but, having heard much the same thing from his\nparents--and, indeed, from some of the knights at the royal palace when\nKing Louis was out of hearing--he was not shocked. But for himself he\nhad never been able to reconcile such views with his sense of his\nobligations as a Christian.\n\nEven so, he began to see why de Verceuil had spoken of Ugolini as if he\nwere a heretic. How could a man with such opinions get to be a cardinal?\n\n\"To leave the Holy Land in the hands of the infidels, Your Eminence?\nWould it not betray Our Lord Himself?\"\n\nUgolini, unperturbed, continued to smile as he walked toward Simon. \"The\nwhole world belongs to God. If Our Savior wished the places where He was\nborn, died, buried, and rose again to be occupied by Christian knights\nfrom Europe, He would have permitted it to happen. As it is, I truly\nbelieve that if we sent every able-bodied man in Christendom to fight in\nOutremer, we could not take Jerusalem back and we could not prevent the\ncrusader strongholds from falling to the Muslims. The infidels, as you\ncall them, are defending their own lands, and a people fighting for\ntheir homeland is always stronger than an invader. Another crusade, even\nwith Tartar help, would be a tragic waste.\"\n\nUgolini stood before the seated Simon, and such was the difference in\ntheir heights that their eyes were almost on a level. Simon wanted to\nstand, but somehow he dared not move. He was beginning to feel\ndesperate. He had walked into a trap that he had not anticipated. He had\nfeared that he would not persuade the cardinal. He had not imagined that\nthe cardinal might persuade him.\n\n\"But you would abandon the Christians who are there now to be overrun\nand slaughtered by the Turks?\" Simon asked.\n\nHe reproached himself. It almost sounded as if he were conceding that\nthere should be no more crusades.\n\nThe cardinal shook his head. \"I would do everything in my power to bring\nthem home.\"\n\nHe sighed and turned away. \"You are a most impressive young man, Count\nSimon. I am glad we have had this chance to hear each other out.\"\n\nSimon felt deeply shaken, as if he had been galloping in a tournament\nand had been ignominiously unhorsed. He had been foolish to think he\ncould sway a man of Ugolini's eminence and intelligence.\n\nCourtesy demanded, he supposed, that he take his leave. He could only\nhope that some of what he said would sink in and influence the\ncardinal's thinking in the future.\n\nUgolini, standing before him, thrust his small hand suddenly under\nSimon's nose, causing Simon to sit back, startled, in his chair. Then\nSimon realized the cardinal was offering him his ring to kiss. He slid\nout of the chair and dropped to one knee. He touched his lips to the\nround, blue sapphire which betokened Ugolini's rank as a cardinal.\n\nWhile he still knelt, the door behind Ugolini swung open. Feeling\nawkward, Simon started to scramble to his feet.\n\nAs he did so, he saw the woman. Her features were delicate, her lips\nfull, her eyes dark and challenging. She wore a yellow gown tied under\nher bosom by an orange ribbon. Simon stared at her, open-mouthed, until\nhe realized he was in a half-crouching position that must look\nperfectly ridiculous. He shut his mouth. He slowly straightened.\n\n\"Buon giorno, my dear Sophia!\" said Cardinal Ugolini. \"Let me introduce\nour distinguished visitor.\"\n\nHe first presented Simon to the young woman and then presented her to\nhim. \"My niece, Sophia Orfali, daughter of my sister who lives at\nSiracusa, in Sicily.\"\n\nIt registered somewhere in Simon's mind that Sicily was part of the\nHohenstaufen kingdom, and it occurred to him to wonder whether Sophia\nwas of gentle birth. It struck him with much greater impact that she was\nan extraordinarily beautiful woman. Swallowing hard, he bowed over her\nhand. His fingertips pressing into her palm felt as if they were\nburning. His lips touched the back of her hand lightly; his eyes filled\nwith smooth, cream-colored skin and the pale blue tint of delicate\nveins. As he stepped back he noticed that she gave off a faint scent of\noranges.\n\nShe stood looking at him with a small, self-possessed smile, waiting for\nhim to speak. All sorts of absurd phrases and sentences flooded into his\nmind--outrageous compliments, declarations of love. The upper part of\nher gown was pulled tight, and he had to make an effort to keep his eyes\nfrom her breasts. His face burned and his throat felt parched.\n\n\"Buon giorno, Signora,\" he choked out. \"It is a great honor to meet\nyou.\"\n\nHer fine arched eyebrows lifted slightly and she answered him in French.\n\"Why do you not speak your native language, Monseigneur?\"\n\nSimon's cheeks burned hotter. \"I assumed you would prefer Italian,\nMadame.\"\n\nShe smiled, and Simon felt there was a shade of scorn in the smile. \"I\nwould prefer French, Monseigneur, to Italian as _you_ speak it.\"\n\n\"Forgive me, Madame,\" Simon whispered.\n\n\"There is nothing to forgive,\" she said airily. Simon thought surely the\ncardinal would reprove his niece for her unkindness, but he stood there\nbeaming like a master showing off a remarkably gifted scholar.\n\n_Ah, lady!_ thought Simon, _I pray you be merciful to me_.\n\nRinging a small bell that stood on his desk, much like the one Friar\nTomasso d'Aquino had used to keep order at the pope's court, Ugolini\nsummoned one of the priests on his household staff, and Simon, his head\nstill spinning from his unexpected encounter with Sophia, found himself\nbeing escorted out of the cardinal's mansion.\n\nAs Simon and the priest were walking through the gallery that led to the\nmain entrance, the outer door swung open and a large gray boarhound\ntrotted in. It was deep-chested, with long ears, a pointed, aristocratic\nmuzzle, and intelligent brown eyes. The dog jumped at Simon, resting his\nforepaws on Simon's chest and looking up at him as if studying his face.\n\nSimon, who had played and hunted with hounds all his life, took an\nimmediate liking to the dog. He scratched the back of the animal's head.\n\n\"Down, Scipio,\" said a deep voice, and Simon saw the hound's master--the\nsame swarthy man with grizzled, curly hair and thick mustache he had met\non the road from the north three days before. The one leading the little\ncompany of bravos.\n\nAgain that tense, besieged feeling came over Simon, the same as when he\nmet this man on the road. There was too much going on in Orvieto, almost\nall of it surprising and much of it seemingly dangerous. If he wanted to\nbe sure the Tartars were safe, he would have to give up sleeping.\n\nThe dog dropped to all fours and stood beside his master.\n\nThe other did not acknowledge having seen Simon before. \"Forgive us,\nSignore. I fear Scipio has gotten dust on your tunic.\"\n\n\"There is nothing to forgive,\" said Simon. He brushed off his\nplum-colored tunic. \"Do you serve Cardinal Ugolini?\" This time he would\nnot let the man pass without questioning him.\n\n\"I am Giancarlo, Signore, a servant of Messer David of Trebizond.\" He\nbowed deeply.\n\nFeeling angry because he was sure he was being lied to, Simon wanted to\nask about the men with Giancarlo on the road, but decided it was better\nnot to appear too suspicious.\n\n_Let them think I am a naive young nobleman, easily gulled. Not so far\nfrom the truth, anyway._\n\n\"Are you also from Trebizond, Messer Giancarlo?\"\n\nThe dark brown eyes were watchful. \"I am a Neapolitan, Signore. Messer\nDavid hired me when he arrived in Italy.\"\n\n_So it is David of Trebizond who is bringing bravos into the city. What\nfor?_\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOut on the street, Simon looked at the spot where the crossbowmen had\nspilled two men's blood. He felt a weary anger. Two lives cut off\nbecause of that fool de Verceuil and his vanity.\n\nWhere the men had been shot there now stood rows of bowls and pots, from\nsmall to large. They were painted white, with pretty floral designs in\nred, blue, and green. A woman sat on the ground beside the display,\npainting a freshly baked jug. She looked up at Simon, then scrambled to\nher feet and stood, bowing deeply.\n\n\"Fine vases and plates, Your Signory? The earthenware of Orvieto is the\nmost beautiful in the world.\"\n\nSimon smiled. \"No doubt, but not today, thank you.\" He must remember to\nbring some samples back to Gobignon, though, he thought. It was\nfine-looking ware, and it might give the potters of Gobignon-la-Ville\nsome good ideas.\n\nHe turned and stared back at the mansion, a great cream-colored cube of\nthe same tufa as the rock on which Orvieto stood.\n\nFrom that rooftop, David of Trebizond had watched the heckling, the\nthrowing of garbage and dung, the sudden killings.\n\nSimon almost expected to see David appear on the roof now, but it\nremained empty. The cardinal's mansion remained flat and featureless,\nrevealing nothing.\n\nSimon sighed longingly. _Oh, for another glimpse of the cardinal's\nniece._\n\nBut there was no sign of her, and he could not stand here any longer.\nSighing again, he walked away.\n\n\n\n\nXVI\n\n\nThe door leading from Cardinal Ugolini's private cabinet to the solar\nswung back, and David came in. As always when she first caught sight of\nDavid, Sophia felt her heart give a little jongleur's somersault. She\nloved the look of his hard eyes with their suggestion of weariness at\nhaving seen too much.\n\nBut now those eyes were turned toward her, and they were narrowed\nangrily.\n\n\"Why were you rude to him?\"\n\nHis harsh tone, when she was so pleased to see him, hurt her. She had no\nready answer for him. To give herself time to think, she walked to the\nsmall chair Simon had occupied and sat down in it.\n\nCardinal Ugolini, sitting at his carved oak table, spoke up.\n\n\"Sophia put him in his place by demonstrating to him that she could\nspeak his language better than he could speak Italian, David. There is\nno end to the arroganzia of these French.\"\n\nDavid was still looking at Sophia. The midday light streaming through\nthe white panes of glass threw sharp shadows under his cheekbones,\ngiving him the gaunt look of a desert saint.\n\n_God's breath, how I would like to paint his picture. At least I could\nhave that much of him._\n\n\"Do you think I wanted you to meet him so that you could teach him\nbetter manners?\" David demanded.\n\n\"Of course not,\" she said, \"but you do not understand men.\"\n\nDavid's laugh was as harsh as the planes of his face.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" Sophia went on impatiently, \"you have always lived with men,\nand you lead men and fight against men. But you do not understand how\nChristian men, especially Frenchmen and Italians, feel about women. You\nknow nothing, for example, of l'amour courtois.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Ugolini. \"The head of every young French nobleman is full of\ntwo things, honor and l'amour courtois.\"\n\nDavid looked from Ugolini to Sophia and back again. \"What is this\nl'amour courtois?\" he demanded. \"I should know about it. Why have you\nnot told me?\"\n\nUgolini lifted his shoulders in a gesture that reminded Sophia of a\nshopkeeper on the Mese.\n\n\"My dear fellow, we cannot guess where the gaps are in your knowledge of\nthe Christian world. That is why it is so dangerous for you to go about\nin public.\"\n\nDavid held out his hands in appeal.\n\n\"You have seen me testify before the pope himself. How can you still be\nafraid?\" He curled his fingers in toward himself, inviting Ugolini to go\non. \"Tell me about courtly love.\"\n\n_How graceful his gestures are._\n\n\"It was begun many years ago by a number of noble ladies of France, and\nespecially Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine, who led an absolutely scandalous\nlife,\" Ugolini said. \"She married the King of France, accompanied him on\ncrusade. Costumed as an Amazon, rode bare-breasted in Jerusalem.\nJerusalem! Divorced the King of France, married the King of England. Had\nlovers uncounted besides.\"\n\n_If I had been born into the nobility, I might have been a woman like\nthat_, Sophia thought wistfully.\n\nDavid shook his head as if buzzing flies circled it. \"But what has this\nto do with Simon de Gobignon?\"\n\n\"As His Excellency said, this Simon comes out of a world shaped by\ncourtly love,\" Sophia answered. \"There are many strict rules about how\nmen and ladies should behave toward one another. One of the most\nimportant is that the woman rules the man.\"\n\nDavid smiled thinly. She had rarely seen a full open smile on his face,\nbut she remembered what a glorious sight it had been and wished he would\nsmile that way now.\n\n\"So, by scorning the way he spoke Italian, you believe you are making\nyourself more attractive to him?\"\n\n\"Far better than I would by letting him put his foot on my neck, the way\nyour harem women do.\"\n\n\"You know nothing about our women.\" But his eyes were crinkled with\nlaughter. \"Less than I do about your courtly lovers. And what do you\nthink of _my_ Italian?\"\n\n\"Better than his,\" she said, and was rewarded with a broader smile.\n\nShe felt a warmth inside as if her heart were melting. Trained from\nchildhood to hide her feelings, she turned her gaze toward the wall\npaintings of the nude Adam and Eve.\n\nA loud knock shook the outer door of the solar. At Ugolini's summons the\ndoor swung inward. Sophia briefly saw the tops of the sun-dappled palm\nand lemon trees in the inner court, beyond the arches and columns of the\ngalleria. Then the door closed again behind Lorenzo, Scipio at his side.\nHe carried a small parchment scroll in his hand.\n\n\"I met the Count de Gobignon at the entry way just now,\" he said. \"Three\ndays ago I was bringing men back from Castel Viscardo, and I encountered\nhim, not knowing then who he was, on the road.\"\n\nDavid muttered something in the Saracen tongue. It could have been a\ncurse or a prayer. But before he could speak, Ugolini's fist struck the\ndesk.\n\n\"He saw you bringing bravos to Orvieto?\" he cried at Lorenzo. \"You will\nget us all killed. I see it now. De Gobignon did not come here to\npersuade me to change my mind about the Tartars. He came here to spy on\nus.\" His voice was shrill with fear.\n\nScipio growled at the cardinal, and Lorenzo slapped him sharply on the\nhead, then on the rump. The dog fell silent at once and trotted off to\nthe corner of the room farthest from Lorenzo. Ugolini and David both\neyed the animal with distaste.\n\n\"Perhaps the count should be killed, then,\" said David, \"before he can\nuse against us what he has learned.\"\n\n_Oh, no, please don't kill him!_\n\nSophia felt an urge to cry out, to do something to protect Simon. And\nwith that protective feeling she saw him again--the glossy, dark brown\nhair that hung in waves almost to his shoulders--the startling blue eyes\nin an angular, intelligent face. The tall, slender body.\n\nAnd that name--Simon. Was there an omen of some sort in that? Did not\nthis Simon even look somewhat like her painting of Saint Simon Stylites,\ncarried with her all the way from Constantinople? As the saint might\nhave looked when he was a young man?\n\nAs Sophia Orfali meeting the Count de Gobignon, she had felt almost half\nin love with Simon.\n\n\"How can you talk of killing him?\" Ugolini cried, his voice almost\ncracking. \"The French cardinals and their men-at-arms would tear the\ncity apart. It might be enough to bring Charles d'Anjou or King Louis\nhimself down here with an army. Sooner or later they would trace it back\nto us. And then, if you want to know your fate\"--his finger moved in\nturn from David to Lorenzo to Sophia--\"go see what they do in the Piazza\ndel Cattedrale to that poor wretch this count captured.\"\n\nSophia felt a sickening, falling sensation in her stomach at this\nreminder of the danger she was in. Usually she managed to keep calm by\nrefusing to think about what would happen if she were caught. She cursed\nUgolini for taking her defenses by surprise.\n\nLorenzo whirled suddenly on Ugolini. \"Get hold of yourself, Cardinal.\nHow can a man think, with you shrieking away like a crazy old nonna?\"\n\n_Good for you, Lorenzo_, she thought.\n\n\"I am a prince of the Roman Catholic Church,\" Ugolini shouted. \"You will\nshow respect!\"\n\nUnabashed, Lorenzo turned to David. \"Despite his hysterics, I do think\nthe cardinal is right. If de Gobignon were murdered, the city would be\nin an uproar. We could not go on with our work.\"\n\n\"Dear God, why did You send these people into my life?\" Ugolini groaned.\n\nLorenzo offered the scroll in his hand to David. \"This prince of the\nChurch has been making such a commotion, I nearly forgot this. A man\nwith a clerical tonsure brought it to the door just after the young\ncount left.\"\n\nDavid's dagger seemed to leap into his hand. The man could move so fast,\nSophia thought. He cut the black ribbon tying the scroll and slipped the\ndagger back into its scabbard. He unrolled the parchment and studied it\nwith a frown.\n\n\"This is in Latin,\" he said, handing the scroll to Ugolini.\n\nRed-faced and breathing heavily, Ugolini took the scroll and read it,\nmoving his finger along the lines. He shut his eyes as if in pain.\n\nWhatever this message was, thought Sophia, it was upsetting him still\nmore.\n\nUgolini looked up with fear-haunted eyes. \"It is from Fra Tomasso\nd'Aquino. He invites you to visit him at the convent of the Dominicans.\nHe says he wants to hear more about your travels.\"\n\nDavid nodded. \"Excellent. I have been wanting to find a way to meet\nprivately with him.\"\n\nUgolini threw the paper to the floor and shook both fists. \"Mother of\nGod! Do you not understand that this is a trap? The Dominicans are in\ncharge of the Inquisition. They are called the domini canes, the hounds\nof the Lord. They can _smell_ heresy.\"\n\nDavid laughed. \"They will not smell it on me. I am a good Muslim.\"\n\nThough Sophia felt inclined to share Ugolini's fear, she delighted in\nDavid's humorous courage. She could not take her eyes from his golden\nhead as he stood in the middle of the room with the light from the\nwindow shining on him.\n\n\"That, d'Aquino will find even easier to detect than heresy,\" said\nUgolini.\n\nA small, amused smile played about David's lips. \"Do you not think I\nhave prepared myself for such a conversation? We need a respected man\nwho can write letters and give sermons warning Christendom against the\nTartars. If Fra Tomasso can be convinced the Tartars are dangerous, and\nif I can offer him something he wants badly enough, he might be the\nman.\"\n\n\"He and his fellow Dominicans will eat you alive,\" Ugolini moaned.\n\n\"I can accomplish nothing hiding here in your palace.\" David gazed down\nat the cardinal, unruffled.\n\nSophia sat perfectly still, hands folded in her lap, looking down at\nUgolini's beautiful Persian carpet. But the quarreling made her writhe\ninwardly. If they could not agree, if they were not careful in their\nplanning, if they started to hate one another, they surely would end by\nbeing torn to pieces on the public scaffold.\n\n\"Let us speak about the young French count,\" she said. \"He, too, might\nbe a man we can use. I did my best to attract him to me today.\"\n\n_If he thinks there is hope of my seducing Simon, he will not be so\nquick to want to kill him._\n\nDavid's eyes held hers for a long moment. \"That is what I want you to\ndo. That was why I was angry, not understanding this courtly love.\" His\nface was somber. \"That is what I brought you here for.\"\n\nShe nodded, thinking, _If only you could be my lover. There would be\nnothing courtly about it, and it would bring us both great happiness._\n\nBut only a moment ago, had she not been thinking of Simon, fearing for\nSimon's life? Had she not almost felt love for him?\n\n_What is happening to me?_\n\nHer hands in her lap clutched at each other. She felt dizzy. It had\nhappened so easily, so quickly. Was she becoming more than one person,\nlike someone possessed by spirits? How could you know who you were\nunless you had a place and were firmly attached to other people?\n\nNow, looking at David, she was aware of the feelings Simon had aroused\nin her as if they were the feelings of another person. Sophia\nKaraiannides wanted David. Her longing for him had been growing in her\never since their eyes first met in Manfred's audience hall months\nbefore.\n\n\"What is troubling you?\" David said, frowning.\n\nShe felt flustered. \"Nothing.\" When he looked skeptical, she added, \"I\nam not certain how he feels about me.\"\n\nDavid glowered at her. She tried to read his expression. He looked\nangry. Was he angry at her for being willing to take Simon as a lover?\n\n_He probably thinks I am nothing but a whore._\n\nShe liked to think of herself as a woman who was able to move easily in\nmany circles, a woman who involved herself in affairs of state. But was\nshe not deceiving herself? Was it not that all men valued her for was\nher body in bed? And David did not even want that; he just wanted to use\nher body to ensnare Simon de Gobignon.\n\nThen why did he look at her so angrily?\n\n\"How will you find out what he feels for you?\" David said. \"Will you\nwait for him to make the next move?\"\n\n\"I will send him a small favor, something he recognizes as mine. Then we\nwill see how interested he is.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said David briskly.\n\nAs if dismissing her, he turned to Lorenzo. \"Speaking of ladies and\nlove, our young friend Rachel is still living here. I want you to escort\nher to Madama Tilia's house this afternoon.\"\n\nSophia stifled a gasp. She felt as if she had been struck from behind.\nShe wanted to cry out in protest, but she knew it was useless.\n\n\"Must I?\" said Lorenzo, and Sophia saw pain in his eyes.\n\n\"Remember your promise to me in Rome,\" David said, fixing him with a\ngrim stare.\n\nLorenzo sighed. \"I remember.\"\n\nSophia's heart, already bruised by her gloomy thoughts about herself,\nached even harder for Rachel. She had tried to save her from being sent\nto Tilia's, but there was no more she could do. If Ugolini was right\nabout their being in such terrible danger, Rachel might be safer at\nTilia's than here.\n\nHow could she help Rachel, she thought desolately, when she herself was\na stranger among strangers?\n\n\n\n\nXVII\n\n\nThe beauty of Orvieto, Simon thought, was that, isolated as it was on\nits great rock, it was as big as it ever could be--and a man could go\nanywhere in the city quickly on foot. Those of wealth and rank often\nrode, but a horse or a sedan chair was a mark of distinction rather than\na necessity. A bird looking down on the city would see a roughly oval\nshape, longer from east to west. One might get lost in the twisting side\nstreets but otherwise could walk along the Corso from one end of Orvieto\nto the other while less than half the sand trickled through an hour\nglass. From Ugolini's mansion on the south side of the town, Simon\nreached the Palazzo Monaldeschi, near the northern wall, so quickly, he\nbarely had time to think over the events of the day.\n\nDavid of Trebizond was a trader, after all, and traders needed armed men\nto protect their caravans. Why worry about the three men with swords and\ncrossbows he had seen with Giancarlo? They were far from being an army.\n\nBut was David actually sending out any caravans?\n\n_If I could put someone in the enemy camp ..._\n\nBefore entering the Palazzo Monaldeschi, he surveyed it with a knight's\neye. It was a three-story brown stone building with a flat roof crowned\nby square battlements. In each of the four corners of the palace there\nwere small turrets with slotted windows for archers. Above the third\nstory rose a block-shaped central tower.\n\nEven as he looked up, he noticed a figure on the battlements, a helmeted\nman with a crossbow on his shoulder. He looked down at Simon, touched\nhis hand to his helmet, and walked on.\n\nIt was good to know that the Monaldeschi family maintained a constant\nguard on their palace. The hidden enemy of the Tartars could get at them\nhere only by a full-scale siege.\n\nSimon walked around the building. If there were two archers in each\nturret, their overlapping fields of fire would cover every possible\napproach. He noted that the piazza in front of the palace and the broad\nstreets on the other three sides allowed attackers no cover. The city\nwall was nearby, though, he saw. Archers could fire on the Monaldeschi\nroof from there, and at least two of the city's defensive towers were so\nclose that stone casters set up in them could score hits on the palace.\n\nWhat if the enemy were to attempt a siege?\n\n_We must control that section of the city wall and make it our first\nline of defense. The buildings around the palace would be our second,\nand the palace itself the third. To control all that, we really need\nanother forty crossbowmen. But how to pay and feed them and keep them\nunder discipline? I will have to make do with my knights, the Venetians,\nthe Armenians, and the Monaldeschi retainers._\n\nAnd he felt the weight of responsibility pressing on his back like a\nboulder. He had studied siege warfare under veterans. But how good, he\nasked himself, would he be in real combat?\n\nHis entire experience of battle consisted of one siege that ended as\nsoon as the rebellious vassal saw the size of Simon's army, one\nencounter in his private forest with poachers who ran away when he drew\nhis sword, and one tournament, two years ago, in Toulouse.\n\nAnd yet, if the Monaldeschi palace were attacked, he would be expected\nto assume command. The thought made his stomach knot with anxiety.\n\nHe scrutinized the palace itself. He saw no windows at all on the ground\nfloor, but there were cross-shaped slots for archers. The second story\nhad narrow windows covered with heavy iron bars. On the highest level\nthe windows were wider and the grills that protected them of a more\ndelicate construction. On that floor were the apartments of the\nMonaldeschi and their more distinguished guests. The darkness and\ncramped quarters one had to endure in the palace because it was so\nwell-fortified were a measure of the fierceness of the street fighting\nthat had been going on in Orvieto, as in most of the cities of northern\nand central Italy, for generations.\n\n_We French are better off doing most of our fighting in the countryside.\nCity fighting is a dirty business._\n\nThere were only two ways into the palace. On the west side a postern\ngate for horses and carts was protected by a gatehouse with two\nportcullises and doors reinforced with iron. In front, facing the\npiazza, a two-story gatehouse with a peaked roof and arrow slots jutted\nout from the center of the building. The doorway was in the side of the\ngatehouse on the second floor, and to reach it one climbed a flight of\nnarrow stairs.\n\n_Why plan for a siege that probably will never take place?_ Simon asked\nhimself.\n\n_Because I have tried to go beyond my duty this day and accomplished\nnothing. I had better be sure I can do what I am expected to do._\n\nThe door swung open as Simon reached the top step.\n\n\"Oh, you look too serious, ragazzo caro. Don't frown so--it will put\nwrinkles in your smooth brow. Surely your life is not so melancholy as\nall that?\" Fingernails stroked his forehead and then his cheek.\n\nSimon recognized the voice, but after the bright sunlight of the street\nit took his eyes a moment to adjust to the darkness inside the doorway\nand actually to see Donna Elvira, the Contessa di Monaldeschi.\n\nShe took him by the hand and led him through the inner door, which, in\nthe time-honored practice of fortified buildings, was set at right\nangles to the outer one. The hallway that ran the length of the second\nfloor was dimly illuminated through the barred windows. Unlit brass oil\nlamps hung at intervals from the ceiling.\n\n\"I saw you from my window and came down to let you in myself.\" The\ncontessa's nose was sharp and hooked like a falcon's beak. It might have\nbeen handsome on a man, but it gave her an unpleasantly predatory look.\nSimon felt distaste at the short silky hairs on her upper lip and\nuneasiness at the bright black eyes that looked at him so greedily. She\ngave off a strong smell of wine. How old was she, he wondered. At least\neighty.\n\nHe politely bowed over her bony knuckles and kissed them quickly. She\nheld his hand longer than necessary.\n\n\"Your greeting does me too much honor, Donna Elvira,\" Simon said, easing\nhis hand away from hers. \"I was frowning because I was thinking of what\nwe must do to protect the ambassadors from Tartary. I am happy to see\nthat you have a guard posted on the roof.\"\n\n\"Always.\" The contessa held up a clenched, bejeweled fist. \"But surely\nyou are not afraid for the emissaries. Who would want to hurt those\nlittle brown men? No, I am ever on guard against my family's ancient\nenemies, the Filippeschi.\"\n\nSimon felt the boulder on his back grow a little heavier.\n\n_Something else to worry about._\n\n\"Is it possible that the Filippeschi family might attack us here?\"\n\nThe contessa nodded grimly. \"They have wanted blood ever since my\nretainers killed the three Filippeschi brothers--the father and the\nuncles of Marco di Filippeschi, who is now their capo della famiglia.\nThey caught them on the road to Rome and cut off the heads of all three,\nto my eternal joy. Six years ago, that was.\"\n\n\"My God! Why did your retainers do that?\"\n\nThere was more than a little madness, Simon thought, in the bright-eyed,\ntoothless grin the contessa gave him. \"Ah, that was to pay them back for\nthe death of my husband, Conte Ezzelino, twenty years ago, and my son\nGaitano, who died fighting beside him, and my nephew Ermanno, whom they\nshot with an arrow from ambush twelve years ago.\" She held up bony\nfingers, totaling up the terrible score. \"They cut out my husband's\ntongue and his heart.\"\n\n\"Horrible!\" Simon exclaimed.\n\n\"Now there remain only myself and my grandnephew, Vittorio, a ragazzo of\ntwelve, to lead the Monaldeschi.\"\n\n\"What of Vittorio's mother?\" Simon asked.\n\nThe contessa shrugged. \"She went mad.\"\n\n_Well she might_, thought Simon.\n\nThe contessa's face turned scarlet as she recounted her injuries. \"Now\nthat canaglia Marco would surely love to finish us by killing Vittorio\nand me. But he is not man enough. And one day I will cut out _his_\ntongue and _his_ heart.\"\n\n\"Might the Filippeschi attack John and Philip, thinking it would hurt\nyou?\" Simon asked.\n\nThe contessa thought for a moment and nodded. \"Ah, that is very clever\nof you. Certainly, they would treat any guest of mine as an enemy of\ntheirs.\" She smiled. \"At any rate, you need not worry about protecting\nthe Tartars today. They are not here.\"\n\nSimon felt as if a trapdoor had opened under his feet. \"Where are they?\"\n\nThe contessa shrugged. \"Riding out in the hills. They left hours ago.\nThey took their own guards and the old Franciscan with them. He told me\nthey were restless.\"\n\n_God's wounds!_\n\nSimon remembered the bloody fight between the Venetians and the\nArmenians. He remembered Giancarlo and his bravos. He thought about what\nthe contessa had just said about the enmity of the Filippeschi.\n\nHe pictured the mutilated bodies of the Tartars sprawled on a mountain\nroad.\n\n\"Did my French knights go with them?\"\n\nThe contessa shrugged. \"They are in the palazzo courtyard, practicing\nwith wooden swords.\"\n\nSimon ground his teeth in rage.\n\n_The idiots! Training themselves for some future battle while their\ncharges go off to face God knows what dangers!_\n\n\"Which road did the Tartars take? I must go after them.\"\n\nThe contessa was by now rather obviously annoyed at his lack of interest\nin her. \"I do not know. Perhaps Cardinal Paulus knows. He spoke to them\nbefore they left.\"\n\nSimon bade the contessa a polite good-bye. She insisted on embracing\nhim. He wondered if he had looked as foolish to Sophia as Donna Elvira\nnow appeared to him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor the second time that day Simon found himself sitting in a chair that\nwas too small for him. The back of this one came to an abrupt stop\nhalfway up his spine, and his shoulders ached even though he had been\nsitting for only a few moments. He had taken off his gloves and tucked\nthem in his sword belt, and he sat with his fists clenched in his lap.\n\nDe Verceuil strode across the room and stood over Simon. \"I may yet\ndemand that you be sent home. I cannot imagine why the Count of Anjou\nentrusted such a stripling with a mission of this importance.\"\n\n\"Your Eminence may not approve of my visiting Cardinal Ugolini,\" Simon\nsaid, keeping his voice firm, \"but can you show me where I have done\nwrong?\" He did not want to talk about Ugolini; he wanted to find out\nwhere the Tartars were. But de Verceuil had not even given him time to\nask.\n\n\"You could have gone wrong in a thousand ways,\" said de Verceuil,\nstaring down at Simon. \"Both the king and Count Charles have confided in\nyou. Rashly, I believe. You might have revealed more about their\nintentions than you should have.\"\n\nSimon remembered how Ugolini had reacted at once to the idea that the\npurpose of the alliance was to conquer Islam completely. Saying that\nmight indeed have been a blunder. He felt his face grow hot.\n\nDiscomfort and anger pushed Simon to his feet. De Verceuil had to take a\nstep backward.\n\n\"Why have you allowed the ambassadors to go riding in the hills with\nonly six men to escort them?\" Simon demanded. \"That is negligence, Your\nEminence. A good deal more dangerous than my visit to Cardinal Ugolini.\nWhere have they gone?\"\n\nDe Verceuil whirled, the heavy gold cross on his chest swinging, and\npaced to the mullioned window, then turned to face Simon again. His\nface, a deep crimson, seemed to glow in the light that came in through\nthe translucent glass.\n\n\"Guarding the ambassadors is your responsibility, Count.\" He spoke in a\nlow, relentless tone. \"I did not bother to inquire where they were\ngoing. If you think they should not have gone out into the countryside,\nyou should have been here to stop them.\" His voice rose to a shout. \"Not\nwaiting upon Cardinal Ugolini!\"\n\nSimon's face grew hot with shame. De Verceuil had him.\n\nEven if he had not done anything wrong by visiting Ugolini, he should\nhave first made sure the ambassadors would be safe while he was gone. He\ncould have left explicit orders with Henri de Puys or with Alain de\nPirenne.\n\n\"I will go after them now.\" Simon started for the door.\n\n\"I have not dismissed you.\"\n\nRage boiled up within Simon. \"I am the Count de Gobignon. Only the king\ncan command me.\"\n\nDe Verceuil crossed the room to thrust his face into Simon's once again.\n\"God can command you, young man, and the Cardinal-Archbishop of Verceuil\nis God's spokesman. Have a care, or I doubt not God will show you how\nfleeting is worldly rank.\"\n\n_Is he trying to use God to threaten me?_ Simon thought, dumbfounded.\n\n\"If you overstep your bounds again,\" de Verceuil went on, \"I promise you\nmy messenger will fly to the Count d'Anjou, demanding that you be\nremoved from this post. If the count must choose between you and me, I\nhave no doubt he will choose the more experienced head and the one more\ninfluential with the pope.\"\n\n\"Do that,\" said Simon, his voice trembling with fury. \"And I will make\nmy own report to the count.\"\n\nHe turned on his heel, and de Verceuil's shout of \"What do you mean by\nthat?\" was cut off by the slam of the heavy oak door.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt seemed to Simon as if the air were filled with motes of gold. He, his\nequerry, Thierry, and de Pirenne and de Puys were riding high on the\nwestern slope of a mountain thickly clad with pines. Shadow drowned the\nvalley below. The horizon to the west was an undulating black\nsilhouette. From beyond that range, the platinum glow of the setting sun\ndazzled his eyes.\n\n\"Look ahead, Monseigneur,\" said Alain, gripping Simon's shoulder and\npointing toward a dark green hill with a rounded top to the north.\nSimon's stomach tightened as he saw a party of riders strung out along\nthe road. They rode in sunlight, and he recognized the flame-colored\ntunics of the Armenians.\n\n_At last_, he thought, sighing and smiling. The Tartars' party had\nridden far. He had followed their trail most of the afternoon, and found\nthem only now because they were coming back.\n\nHe squinted, trying to see the Tartars. He clucked to his palfrey and\nspurred her lightly from a walk to a trot. His three companions did the\nsame.\n\nTwo carts with high sides lurched down the road behind the Armenians. A\nsingle mule pulled the cart in front, two drew the second. A man in a\nred tunic drove each cart. Where the devil were the Tartars? Bringing up\nthe rear of the party on the back of a donkey, he saw a figure in brown.\nFriar Mathieu. Simon began to feel panic again.\n\n\"Do you see the Tartars?\" he asked his men.\n\nDe Puys snorted. \"They are probably too lazy to ride. They are sitting\nin one of those carts, fancying themselves lords of the earth.\"\n\n\"Tartars think it unmanly to be carried when they can ride,\" Simon told\nde Puys, annoyed at the old knight's ignorance.\n\n\"But I see horses without riders,\" Alain de Pirenne said. \"Four of\nthem.\"\n\nSimon squinted again and saw that each of four Armenians on horseback\nwas leading a riderless horse.\n\nEven though it was a warm evening, he felt as if a sudden blast of cold\nwind were blowing right through him. He sat frozen in the saddle.\n\n_Dear God, are we too late?_\n\n\"Follow me,\" he snapped, kicking his palfrey hard.\n\nRiding as quickly as they dared down the rocky, unfamiliar road, they\nheard church bells chiming out the Angelus. The shadow cast by the hills\nto the west rose to engulf them as they descended.\n\nThe Armenians had gathered on the other side of a meandering river at\nthe very bottom of the valley and seemed to be trying to decide where to\ncross. Simon still saw no sign of the Tartars, but it was too dark to\nmake anyone out clearly.\n\nIn his dread he rode his horse straight into the river. She stumbled on\nthe rocky bed a time or two, and once plunged into a deep place where\nshe had to swim. It being the end of August, all the streams hereabout\nwere at their lowest level. Even so, when Simon got across he was soaked\nup to his waist.\n\nHe saw the Armenians unslinging their bows and nocking arrows. \"It is I,\nde Gobignon!\" he shouted. He heard Friar Mathieu call something to the\nmen, and they lowered their bows. Good that they were alert, he thought,\nbut what might have happened to them on the road to make them so?\n\nHe rode in among the Armenians, and felt a hollow pit in his stomach as\nhe saw the rich saddles on two of the riderless horses, silver and\nmother-of-pearl inlays glistening even in the darkness of the forest.\n\n\"Simon!\" Friar Mathieu, on donkeyback, called.\n\nSimon turned to the nearest cart and looked in over the shoulder of the\ndriver, one of the Armenians, who stared at him from under heavy brows.\n\nThere, on a bed of straw, lay two bodies. They had the short, broad\nbuild of the Tartar ambassadors. Simon's heart stopped beating.\n\n\"Mary, Mother of God!\" Simon whispered. He got down from his horse.\n\nMathieu was beside him, gripping his arm. \"Did you come looking for us,\nSimon?\"\n\nSimon was sick with despair. He gestured feebly at the two bodies.\n\n\"What happened to them?\"\n\n\"You might call it a mischance due to their inexperience. I tried to\nwarn them, but they would not heed me.\"\n\n\"Mischance? What sort of mischance?\" Did it matter, Simon wondered, how\nthis had happened? He had failed utterly and absolutely, that was all\nthat counted. His foolish decision to go to Ugolini had led to this\ndisaster. Another stain on the house of Gobignon.\n\nHe put his hands to his face. \"If only I had stayed with them this\nmorning.\"\n\nMathieu patted his arm. \"Do not reproach yourself. No one will blame\nyou. It would probably have happened just the same even if you were\nthere.\"\n\nSimon felt the old friar's words like a blow in the face. What shame, to\nbe thought so useless that even his presence would not have saved the\nTartars. But, he told himself, turning the knife in his own guts, it was\ntrue. Anyone stupid enough to let something like this happen _would_\nsurely be useless in a moment of danger.\n\n\"Did you not know how dangerous these hills could be?\" he asked.\n\n\"They were determined on a long ride,\" said Friar Mathieu. \"Tartars are\nused to vast distances and great spaces. You cannot imagine how\nmiserable they were feeling, cooped up in a hill town surrounded by a\nwall on top of a rock. I felt sorry for them. In fact, I even feared for\ntheir health.\"\n\nSimon was indignant. \"Feared for their health! The devil you say! Now\nlook at them.\"\n\nFriar Mathieu squeezed Simon's arm. \"Do not mention the devil. He may\ncome when you call. As for them\"--he waved a hand at the two inert\nforms in the cart--\"this is embarrassing, to be sure, but we need not\nblame ourselves.\"\n\n\"Embarrassing? Embarrassing! Is that all you call it?\"\n\nOne of the bodies on the straw moved. As Simon stared, it lurched to its\nknees. He heard a few slurred words in the guttural speech of the\nTartars. The figure crawled on hands and knees to the side of the cart,\nlifted its head, and vomited loudly and copiously.\n\n\"They are not dead!\" Simon cried.\n\n\"Dead drunk,\" said Friar Mathieu.\n\nRelief was so sudden and stunning that for a moment Simon could not\nbreathe. He caught his breath and gasped. The gasp was followed by a\nroar of laughter. Simon stood, his head thrown back, helpless with\nlaughter. He pressed his hands against his aching stomach.\n\nFriar Mathieu had gone to attend the sick Tartar. He wiped the man's\nface with the sleeve of his robe, went to the stream and washed the\nsleeve, then came back and pressed the wet wool to the Tartar's brow.\n\n\"Can you not stop laughing?\" he said on his second trip to the stream.\n\"The Armenians do not like you laughing at their masters.\"\n\n\"Dead drunk!\" Simon shouted, and went into another spasm of laughter.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt started innocently enough, Friar Mathieu explained as they rode back\ntogether. He himself had proposed to take the road to Montefiascone,\nalong which he had heard there was a particularly impressive view of\nOrvieto. Simon remembered the spot. He had been enjoying that same view\nwhen David of Trebizond's servant--what was his name?--Giancarlo, came\nalong with those three heavily armed men.\n\nThe Tartars had been pleased enough with the view, but they wanted to\nride on. Friar Mathieu felt some trepidation that they might encounter\nhighwaymen in the hills. But he had confidence in the Armenians, too,\nand so they pressed on along the mountain road.\n\n\"They observed everything and talked to each other in such low voices I\ncould not hear them.\" Mathieu turned to give Simon a pained look. \"I\nthink they were discussing how an army might be brought through these\nhills.\"\n\nSimon was appalled. He pictured a Tartar army, tens of thousands of\nfur-clad savages on horseback, sweeping through Umbria on its way to\nRome, burning the towns and the farms and slaughtering the people. Simon\nshook his head in perplexity. If such a thing happened, he would have\nhelped to bring it about.\n\nBy the time the Tartars and their entourage reached the little town of\nMontefiascone, Mathieu went on, in the heart of vineyard-covered hills,\nthey were all hungry and thirsty. They took over the inn--the black\nlooks cast by the Armenians were enough to drive out the other\npatrons--and proceeded to drink up the host's considerable supply of\nwine.\n\n\"The wine of Montefiascone is a great gift from God,\" Mathieu said.\n\"Very clear, almost as light as spring water, just a touch sweet, just a\ntouch tart. And the host brought it up from a stone cellar that kept it\ndeliciously cold. Not strong wine, actually, but the Tartars drank _all\nthere was_.\"\n\nFriar Mathieu pointed to the young Armenian leader, Prince Hethum, who\nwas now riding beside Alain de Pirenne, at the head of their procession\nback to Orvieto. The prince was carrying the Tartars' purse, now\nsomewhat less fat with gold florins. The host at the inn had been\ndelighted to serve his thirsty guests, but when his supply of wine was\ngone, the Tartars turned ugly. Philip Uzbek, the younger Tartar, grabbed\nthe host by the throat. The Armenians, who were careful to drink\nsparingly, fingered their bows. The innkeeper left his wife as a hostage\nand went out to the nearby farms, and after a tense hour arrived back\nwith a cartload of wine barrels. This time the wine outlasted the\nTartars.\n\n\"They have no head for wine, you see,\" Mathieu said. \"Poor innocent\nworld conquerors. They drink a beverage called kumiss, which is\nfermented mare's milk. Very mild, but it satisfies their desire to get\ndrunk. When they conquered the civilized lands, for the first time they\ncould have as much wine as they wanted. They have an ungodly appetite\nfor it.\"\n\nWhen the Tartar ambassadors collapsed, unconscious, Mathieu and the host\nhad both sighed with relief. With the Tartars' gold, Mathieu bought two\ncarts and three mules, and they loaded John Chagan and Philip Uzbek in\none and the remaining barrels of Montefiascone wine in the other.\n\n\"Montefiascone may be the only town in the world that can say it has\nbeen invaded by Tartars and profited,\" said Mathieu. Simon laughed.\n\nHe had thought to bring flint, tinder, a lantern, and a supply of\ncandles with him, and now Thierry rode at the head of the party with the\nlantern raised on the end of a long tree branch, giving them a little\nlight to follow. At least this way the Tartars would not go over a cliff\nin their cart in the dark.\n\n\"If I could have found you this morning, I would have asked you to come\nalong and bring some of your Frenchmen,\" the old friar said. \"But you\nwere meeting with Cardinal Ugolini, were you not?\"\n\nWhen Mathieu mentioned Ugolini, Simon immediately found himself thinking\nof the cardinal's beautiful niece. He wondered, was she older than he?\nHow would she react if he tried to see her again? He wished he could\nforget Tartars and crusaders and Saracens and devote himself to paying\ncourt to Sophia. Of course, if he went anywhere near Ugolini's\nestablishment again, de Verceuil would undoubtedly think he was trying\nto continue the forbidden negotiations.\n\n\"My efforts went badly,\" he told Friar Mathieu. Before going on, he\npeered as far along the road ahead as he could see. De Pirenne and de\nPuys were both riding at the head of the party, just behind Thierry with\nhis lantern. Hethum and the other Armenians came next, and they\nunderstood no French. Simon and Friar Mathieu were at the end of the\nline, behind the two carts. There was no risk in talking.\n\n\"Cardinal Ugolini nearly convinced me that our efforts to liberate the\nHoly Land are futile. And then de Verceuil knew that I had gone to\nUgolini, and he was furious. How did he know where I had been?\"\n\nFriar Mathieu smiled. \"He had you followed.\"\n\n\"That snake!\"\n\nThe Franciscan reached over and laid his fragile hand lightly on\nSimon's. \"Hush, Simon. The cardinal will answer to God one day for his\nworldly ways.\"\n\nSimon shook his head. \"I tell you, Friar Mathieu, between Ugolini's\npersuasion and de Verceuil's bullying, I was nearly ready to leave\nOrvieto today.\"\n\nBut he would not have left under any circumstances, he knew. Especially\nnot after meeting Sophia. He recalled her smoldering eyes and full red\nlips. And her splendid breasts. Ah, no, he must stay in Orvieto and\nbecome better acquainted with Sophia Orfali.\n\n\n\n\nXVIII\n\n\nA swollen yellow moon appeared over the treetops, and Simon was grateful\nfor its light. Now they would have less trouble following the road.\n\nFriar Mathieu said, \"It is not an easy thing for so young a man to match\nwits with two powerful churchmen skilled in dialectic. I congratulate\nyou on doing it at all.\"\n\nSimon felt a hollow in his stomach. He saw himself going back to France,\nsneered at not only for his family's disgrace but for his own\nincompetence.\n\n\"Our mission _must_ succeed,\" he said, clenching his fist. His voice\nrose above the creak of the wagon wheels, surprising even himself with\nhis vehemence.\n\n\"God has His own ideas about what ought to succeed or fail,\" said Friar\nMathieu. \"Do not try to take the whole burden on yourself.\"\n\n\"I must,\" said Simon, feeling tears burn his eyes.\n\nThe voice in the semidarkness beside him was soft, kindly. \"Why _must_?\"\n\n\"Because of who I am,\" Simon said in a low voice.\n\n\"What do you mean, Simon?\"\n\n_Can I tell him_, Simon wondered. Ever since, seven years ago, his\nmother and Roland had told him the secret of his birth, questions of who\nhe really was, questions of right and wrong, had assailed him, and there\nhad been no one to ask. He loved his mother and he admired Roland, but\nthey were too close to it all. But to tell anyone else would bring\ncalamity down on all three of them.\n\nThere had been times during the years Simon had lived with King Louis\nthat the king had seemed ready to listen. But Simon had also known that\nKing Louis believed in doing right no matter whom it hurt.\n\nFriar Mathieu, though, seemed to have more of a sense that life was not\na matter of simple rights and wrongs. He could see the Tartars for the\nferocious creatures they were, and yet feel kindly toward them. His\nwisdom and worldly experience could help Simon sort things out.\n\nThen, too, there was a way to bind Friar Mathieu never to speak of this\nto anyone.\n\nBut when Simon tried to speak, his chest and throat were constricted by\nfear, and his voice came out in a croak. He felt as if he were under a\nspell to prevent him from uttering his family secrets.\n\n\"Father, may I confide in you under the seal of confession?\"\n\nThe old Franciscan tugged on the reins of his donkey, so that they fell\nfarther behind the rest of the party. Simon slowed his palfrey to fall\nback beside Mathieu.\n\n\"Is it truly a matter for confession, or just a secret?\"\n\nSimon's hands were so cold he pressed them against his palfrey's neck to\nwarm them. How could he tell everything to this priest he had known only\na few months? Perhaps he should just apologize and say no more.\n\nBut he thought a little longer and said, \"It is a question of right and\nwrong. And if I am doing wrong, I am committing a terribly grave sin.\"\n\nFriar Mathieu looked around him. \"Very well, then, what you tell me is\nunder the seal of the sacrament of confession, and I may repeat it to no\nman, under penalty of eternal damnation. Make the sign of the cross and\nbegin.\"\n\nSimon touched his fingertips to forehead, chest, and shoulders. For a\nmoment he hesitated, his mouth dry and his heart hammering. He had\npromised his mother and Roland never to tell anyone about this.\n\n_But I must! I cannot have it festering inside me for the rest of my\nlife._\n\nWhat, though, if Friar Mathieu disappointed him? What if he had nothing\nuseful, or even comforting to say on learning Simon's secret? Well,\nthere was a way to test him.\n\nThe secret was really twofold. One part of it was terrible enough, but\nalready known to the king and queen and many knights who had been on the\nlast crusade. Simon could tell Friar Mathieu the lesser secret safely\nenough, then weigh his response and decide whether to tell him what was\nknown to only three people in the world.\n\n\"I said I must make this mission succeed because of who I am. What have\nyou heard about the last Count de Gobignon?\"\n\nBy now the moon had risen high, and Simon could see the old Franciscan's\nface quite clearly. Friar Mathieu frowned and stroked his long white\nbeard.\n\n\"Very little, I am afraid. He was a very great landowner, one of the\nfive Peers of the Realm, as you are now, and he was zealous in putting\ndown the Cathar heretics in Languedoc.\" He cast a pained look at Simon.\n\"I spent the years when your father was prominent wandering the roads as\na beggar, then studying for the priesthood, and I am afraid I paid very\nlittle attention to what was happening in the world.\"\n\nFriar Mathieu's reply brought a sad smile to Simon's lips.\n\n\"That you, like most people, know so little of Amalric de Gobignon I owe\nto the generosity of King Louis and those close to him. The man whose\nname I inherited was a murderer, an archtraitor, a Judas. But when King\nLouis came back from that failed crusade in Egypt, he decreed that Count\nAmalric's deeds not be made known.\"\n\n\"I well remember my horror when I heard that the king was captured and\nhis army destroyed,\" said Friar Mathieu. \"I fell on my knees in the\nroad, weeping, and prayed for him and the queen and the other captives.\nWhat joy when we learned they were ransomed and would be coming back to\nus.\"\n\n\"It was Count Amalric's treachery that caused the calamity.\" It seemed\nto Simon that Nicolette, his mother, and her husband, Roland, had told\nhim the story hundreds of times. They wanted him to know it by heart.\n\n\"He believed that the Cathars had murdered his father, Count Stephen de\nGobignon, my grandfather,\" Simon went on. \"King Louis advocated mercy\ntoward heretics. Count Amalric had a brother, Hugues, a Dominican\ninquisitor, who was killed before his very eyes by an assassin's arrow\nin B\u00e9ziers while he was presiding over the burning of Cathars.\"\n\n\"Ah, those heresy-hunting Dominicans.\" Friar Mathieu shook his head.\n\n\"When Hugues was killed, Count Amalric blamed the king's leniency toward\nheretics. After that, it seems, a madness possessed the count. He came\nto believe he could overthrow the king and take his throne.\"\n\n\"He must have been mad,\" said Friar Mathieu. \"Never has a King of France\nbeen so loved as this Louis.\"\n\n\"Count Amalric went on crusade with King Louis, taking my mother,\nCountess Nicolette, along with him, even as King Louis took Queen\nMarguerite. I was a very young child then. They left me in the keeping\nof my mother's sisters. The crusaders captured Damietta, at the mouth of\nthe Nile, left the noncombatants there and marched southward toward\nCairo.\"\n\nSimon hesitated, feeling himself choke up again. These were the crimes\nof the man everyone believed was his father. It was agony to give voice\nto them.\n\nBut he plunged on. \"At a city called Mansura, Count Amalric led part of\nhis own army into a trap, and most were killed. He tricked the rest of\nthe army, including the king, into surrendering to the Mamelukes. He\nalone escaped. He went to Damietta, supposedly to take charge of the\ndefense. He made a secret promise to the Sultan of Cairo to deliver\nDamietta, together with the ransom money, if the sultan would slay the\nking and all the other captive crusaders.\"\n\nFriar Mathieu gasped. \"Why in God's name would a French nobleman do such\ndreadful things?\"\n\n\"With the king and his brothers dead, he would be the most powerful man\nin France,\" said Simon. \"He might have succeeded, but for two things.\nFirst, the Mameluke emirs, led by the same Baibars who now rules Egypt,\nrose in revolt and killed the sultan with whom Count Amalric was\nbargaining. Baibars and the Mamelukes preferred to deal honorably with\ntheir prisoners.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes, Baibars,\" Friar Mathieu nodded. \"The Tartars hate him and all\nof Outremer fears him.\"\n\n\"And then a knight-troubadour captured along with the king, one who had\nan old grudge against the Count de Gobignon, offered to go to Damietta\nand meet the count in single combat. After a fierce combat he slew Count\nAmalric. The king and the surviving crusaders were saved and they\nransomed themselves. The troubadour's name was Roland de Vency.\"\n\n\"I never heard of him,\" said Friar Mathieu.\n\n\"No, just as you never heard of Count Amalric's treason. The king wanted\nthe whole episode buried in an unmarked grave along with the count.\"\n\nThere was silence between them for a moment. Simon listened to the cart\nwheels creak and looked up at the moon painting the Umbrian hillsides\nsilver. Soon they would round a bend and see the lights of Orvieto.\n\nSimon, torn by anguish, wondered what Friar Mathieu thought of him. Did\nhe despise him, as so many great nobles did? He remembered that Friar\nMathieu had once been a knight himself. How could he not hate a man with\nAmalric de Gobignon's blood in him? His muscles knotted as he waited to\nhear what Friar Mathieu would say.\n\nHe looked at the old Franciscan and saw sadness in his watery eyes.\n\n\"But what happened does not lie buried, much as the king and you would\nwish it to.\"\n\nSimon felt tears sting his eyes and a lump grow in his throat. He\nremembered the sneers, the slights, the whispers he had endured. Such\nheartbreaking moments were among his earliest memories.\n\nHe shook his head miserably. \"No. What happened has never been\nforgotten.\"\n\n\"You are ashamed of the name you bear.\" The kindness in Friar Mathieu's\nvoice evoked a warm feeling in Simon's breast.\n\n_I was not mistaken in him._\n\n\"You are--how old--twenty?\"\n\nSimon nodded.\n\n\"At your age most men, especially those like you with vast estates and\ngreat responsibilities, are married or at least plighted.\"\n\nPain poured out with Simon's words. \"I have been rebuffed twice. The\nname of de Gobignon is irrevocably tainted.\"\n\nFriar Mathieu rubbed the back of his donkey's neck thoughtfully.\n\"Evidently the king does not think so, or he would not have honored you\nwith so important a task.\"\n\n\"He did everything possible to help me. When my mother and my\ngrandmother fought over who should have the rearing of me, the king\nsettled it by making himself my guardian and taking me to live in the\npalace. Then his brother, Count Charles d'Anjou, took me for a time as\nhis equerry.\"\n\n\"Why did your mother and grandmother fight over you?\"\n\nThe hollow of dread in Simon's middle grew huge. Now they were coming to\nthe deepest secret of all.\n\n\"My mother married the troubadour, Roland de Vency. My grandmother,\nCount Amalric's mother, could never accept as a father to me the man who\nslew her son.\"\n\nHe felt dizzy with pain, remembering his grandmother's screams of rage,\nhis mother's weeping, Roland facing the sword points of a dozen\nmen-at-arms, long, mysterious journeys, hours of doing nothing in empty\nrooms while, somewhere nearby, people argued over his fate. God, it had\nbeen horrible!\n\nFriar Mathieu reached out from the back of his donkey and laid a\ncomforting hand on Simon's arm. \"Ah, I understand you better now.\nCarrying this family shame, fought over in childhood, no real parents to\nlive with. And the burden of all that wealth and power.\"\n\nSimon laughed bitterly. \"Burden! Few men would think wealth and power a\nburden.\"\n\nFriar Mathieu chuckled. \"No, of course not. But you know better, do you\nnot? You have already realized that you must work constantly to use\nrightly what you have, or it will destroy you as it destroyed your\nfather.\"\n\n_Yes, but ..._\n\nSimon thought of the endless fields and forests of the Gobignon domain\nin the north, what pleasure it was to ride through them on the hunt. How\nthe unquestioning respect of vassals and serfs eased his doubts of\nhimself. He thought of the complaisant village and peasant girls who\nhappily helped him forget that no woman of noble blood would marry him.\nHe reminded himself that only three or four men in all the world were in\na position to tell him what to do. No, if only the name he bore were\nfree of the accursed stain of treachery, he would be perfectly happy to\nbe the Count de Gobignon.\n\nFriar Mathieu broke in on his thoughts. \"You feel you must do something\ngrand and noble to make up for your father's wickedness. Listen: A man\ncan live only his own life. The name de Gobignon, what is it? A puff of\nair. A scribble on a sheet of parchment. You are not your name. You are\nnot Simon de Gobignon.\"\n\nSimon's blood turned to ice. _Does he know?_\n\nBut then he realized Friar Mathieu was speaking only figuratively.\n\n\"But men of great families scorn me because I bear the name de\nGobignon,\" he said. \"I will have to live out my life in disgrace.\"\n\n\"God respects you,\" said Friar Mathieu quietly and intensely. \"Weighed\nagainst that, the opinion of men is nothing.\"\n\n_That is true_, Simon thought, and great chains that had weighed him\ndown as long as he could remember suddenly fell away. He felt himself\ngasping for breath.\n\nFriar Mathieu continued. \"The beauty of my vows is that with their help\nI have come to know who I truly am. I have given up my name, my\npossessions, the love of women, my worldly position. You need not give\nup all those things. But if you can part with them in your mind, you can\ncome to know yourself as God knows you. You can see that you are not\nwhat people think of you.\"\n\nTears of joy burned Simon's eyelids. _Thank you, God, for allowing me to\nmeet this man._\n\n\"Yes,\" Simon whispered. \"Yes, I understand.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Friar Mathieu, a note of light reproof in his voice, \"I know\nyou have not told me everything.\"\n\nCaught by surprise, Simon was thankful that the lantern up ahead started\nswinging from right to left, a ball of light against the stars.\n\nDe Pirenne's voice came back faintly to Simon. \"Orvieto!\"\n\nFrom the cart in front of Simon, the one carrying the Tartars, came the\nsound of loud snoring. An Armenian chuckled and said something in a\nhumorous tone, and the others laughed. Simon pretended to be intensely\ninterested in what the Armenians were saying and in the view up ahead.\n\n\"Simon,\" said Friar Mathieu.\n\n_If he has relieved me of one burden, can he not take away the other,\nthe greater?_\n\n\"Patience, Father. We are coming to the spot where the road bends around\nthe mountain, and we will be able to see Orvieto. Everyone will be\ngathering to rest a bit. Let us wait until we are spread out on the road\nagain.\"\n\nFriar Mathieu shrugged. \"As you wish.\"\n\nAcross the valley the silhouette of Orvieto loomed like an enchanted\ncastle against the moonlit sky. The yellow squares of candlelit windows\nglowed among the dark turrets and terraces. The tall, narrow windows of\nthe cathedral church of San Giovenale were multicolored ribbons of\nlight. Simon found himself wondering where Sophia, the cardinal's niece,\nwas right now, and what she was doing.\n\nWhen they were stopped by the shrine of San Sebastian, Simon took the\nlantern and peered down at the Tartars. The stench of wine and vomit\nhung heavily over their bed of straw, and both of them were snoring\nloudly. Aside from being in a stupor, they seemed well enough. The\nstringy black beard of the younger one, Philip, was clotted with bits of\nhalf-digested food. Friar Mathieu produced a comb from his robe and\ncleaned the beard. Simon rode to the head of the party.\n\n\"What are you and the old monk gabbling about back there?\" asked Alain.\n\n\"He is hearing my confession,\" said Simon lightly.\n\nAlain laughed. \"If you have done anything you need to confess, you've\nbeen clever about hiding it from me.\"\n\nWhen they were back on the road, Simon and Friar Mathieu took up their\nposition at the end of the line.\n\n\"How did you know there was more, Father?\"\n\n\"You asked me to keep what you have told me secret under the seal of the\nconfessional,\" said Friar Mathieu. \"But you have told me nothing that is\na sin on your part.\"\n\nGuilt pierced Simon's heart like a sword, twisting in the wound as he\nthought how he was betraying his true father and his mother.\n\n_I have sworn to Nicolette and Roland never to tell this to anyone._\n\nHe took a deep breath.\n\n_But I may never again have a chance to talk about it with a wise person\nI can trust._\n\nAnother deep breath.\n\nAnd then: \"The truth of it is, Amalric de Gobignon was not my father.\"\n\nFriar Mathieu was silent for a moment. \"The man who slew Count Amalric.\nThe man your mother married soon after the count was dead.\" His voice\nwas soft and full of kindness.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Simon, almost choking. \"And now you know my sin. The world\nthinks I am the son of a traitor and murderer, which is bad enough. But\nI am not even that man's son. I am an impostor, a bastard, and I have no\nright to the title of Count de Gobignon.\"\n\nSimon flicked the reins, and his palfrey started picking her way down\nthe road into the Vallia de Campesito. Mathieu clucked to his donkey and\nkept pace with him.\n\n\"Do you believe that you are committing a grave sin by being the Count\nde Gobignon?\"\n\n\"My mother and Roland say no, but I do not think they are very good\nChristians. They are full of pagan ideas. I am Count Amalric's only male\nheir. And the blood of the house of Gobignon does flow in my veins. I am\nnot the son of Count Amalric de Gobignon, but I am the grandson of his\nfather, Count Stephen de Gobignon.\"\n\nFriar Mathieu clapped his hand to his forehead. \"I am lost in the tangle\nof bloodlines. What in heaven's name do you mean?\"\n\nSimon's entire body burned with shame as he thought how accursed his\nfamily would seem to anyone hearing this for the first time. The bastard\nson of a bastard son. The usurper of his half uncle's title. Tangled,\nindeed. Twisted was a better word for it.\n\nIn his agony he whispered the words. \"Roland de Vency, my true father,\nis the bastard son of Count Stephen de Gobignon, sired by rape in\nLanguedoc. Roland and Count Amalric were half brothers.\"\n\n\"God's mercy!\" exclaimed Friar Mathieu. \"But then you do have some claim\nby blood to the title. To whom else could it go?\"\n\n\"I suppose the fiefdom could go to my oldest sister, Isabelle, and her\nhusband. He is a landless knight, a vassal of the Count of Artois. My\nthree sisters married far beneath their stations--because of what Count\nAmalric did.\"\n\nFriar Mathieu sighed. \"Would any great evil come of it, do you think, if\nyou were to give up your estate?\"\n\n\"My mother and father--my true father, Roland de Vency--would be exposed\nas adulterers. We would all be charged as criminals, for defrauding the\nkingdom and the rightful heirs, whoever they might be.\" He saw his\nmother kneeling with her head on a chopping block, and a chill of horror\nwent through him.\n\n\"Simon, this is no easy question you have set before me this night. The\nlives of thousands of people, even the future of the kingdom, could be\ndetermined by who holds the Gobignon domains. I think it is not so\nimportant that the Count de Gobignon be the _rightful_ person as that he\nbe the _right_ person. Do you take my meaning?\"\n\n\"I think so,\" said Simon. What Friar Mathieu was saying gave him a faint\nfeeling of hope.\n\n\"I know you well enough to know that the people of Gobignon are blessed\nto have you as their seigneur. When a bad man inherits a title, we say\nit must be God's will, and those who owe him obedience are bound to\naccept him. Might we not say that when a man like you is invested with a\ntitle, regardless of how he came by it, that is God's will, too? In any\ncase, Simon, we cannot settle this question tonight. There is too much\nat stake, and we must proceed thoughtfully.\"\n\n\"But what if--if something happens to me while I am in sin?\" Simon\npictured himself lying in a street in Orvieto, blood streaming from his\nchest as Sophia watched, weeping, from a distant window. And then he saw\ngrinning Saracen-faced demons in hell jabbing him with spears and\nscimitars.\n\n\"I can give you absolution conditional on your desire to do whatever is\nright,\" said Friar Mathieu. \"Promise God that you will make all haste to\ndetermine His will in this matter and that when you know what He wants,\nyou will faithfully do it, whether it be to give up the title or to keep\nthe title and the secret. I need hardly remind you that God sees into\nyour heart and knows whether you truly mean to set things right. Say an\nAct of Contrition.\"\n\nThe weight of shame seemed as crushing as ever, and Simon did not think\nFriar Mathieu's speaking Latin words while he himself spoke the formula\nof repentance would take the burden away. But he began the Act of\nContrition.\n\nHis voice as he uttered the prayer was barely audible over the clicking\nof the horses' hooves on the stony road, the rumbling of the two carts\nand the rustling of the pines on the hillside. He repeated what Friar\nMathieu had said to him about being ready to follow God's will. Then the\nold Franciscan made the Sign of the Cross in the air.\n\nThe road narrowed now so that there was not enough room for horses side\nby side. Simon fell behind Friar Mathieu.\n\n_Roland and Nicolette need never know I told anyone._\n\nThe only way they would find out would be if he felt called upon to\nreveal the secret to the world.\n\nHe felt as if his whole body were plunged into icy water. He realized\nthat by his promise to Friar Mathieu--to God--he was embarked on a\ncourse that could end in ruin or worse for his mother and father as well\nas himself. Their pretense that Simon was Amalric's child was a crime.\nHe saw them all brought as prisoners before King Louis.\n\nHow could he bear to face the king, whom he admired more than any other\nman in France, even more than his own true father?\n\nWhat punishment would the king mete out to them? Would they spend the\nrest of their lives locked away in lightless dungeons? Would they have\nto die for their crime?\n\nSurely God would not ask that of him.\n\nAnd then, Simon might decide, with God's help, that he had the best\nright of anyone to the count's coronet. If he kept it, and kept the\nsecret of his parentage, it would be through his own choice. No mortal\nwould thrust that choice upon him.\n\nHe began to feel better. He started humming a tune, an old crusader song\nRoland had taught him, called \"The Old Man of the Mountain.\"\n\nUntil now other hands had shaped his life. From this moment on he would\nhold his destiny in his own hands.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"May I disturb you for a moment, Your Signory, before you retire?\" The\nContessa di Monaldeschi's chief steward was a severe-looking man with\nlong white hair streaked with black.\n\nSimon had just set foot to the steps leading to the third story of the\nMonaldeschi palace, where his bedchamber waited. He most definitely did\nnot want to be disturbed this evening. But the steward had shown gravity\nand discretion arranging for the drunken Tartars to be bundled off to\nbed, and Simon felt that whatever he might say would be worth listening\nto.\n\n\"Late this afternoon a vagabondo came to our door. He claims to be a\nformer retainer of yours. He begs an audience with you--most humbly, he\nsays to tell you. He waits in the kitchen. We can keep him till\ntomorrow. Or we can put him out in the street. Or you can see him.\nWhatever Your Signory desires.\"\n\nA former retainer? A sour suspicion began to grow in Simon's mind.\n\n\"Did he at least tell you his name?\"\n\n\"Yes, Your Signory. Sordello.\"\n\nSimon felt hot blood pounding at his temples in immediate anger.\n\n_Has that dog had the temerity to follow me all the way to Orvieto?_\n\n\"Send him away,\" he said brusquely. \"And do not be gentle about it.\"\n\nThe steward's stern face remained expressionless. \"Very good, Your\nSignory.\" He bowed himself away. A good servant, thought Simon. He\nshowed neither approval nor disapproval. Simon started up the stairs.\n\n_What the devil could Sordello have to talk to me about?_\n\n_Do not call upon the devil. He may hear you and come._\n\nHalfway up the stairs Simon felt the itch of curiosity growing stronger\nand stronger. Perhaps Sordello had been to see Count Charles and had\nsome word from him. The feeling was like a scab Simon knew he should not\npick but could not let alone.\n\nHe turned. The steward was almost invisible in the shadows at the end of\nthe long hallway.\n\n\"Wait. I will go to him.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the kitchen on the bottom floor of the Palazzo Monaldeschi, under a\nchimney in the center of the room, a cauldron big enough to hold a man\nsimmered over a low fire. From it came a strong smell of lamb, chicken,\nonion, celery, peppers, garlic, cloves, and other ingredients Simon\ncould not identify. Beyond the cauldron a trapdoor covered the stairs to\na locked cellar pantry where, Simon knew, the Monaldeschi hoarded\npossessions as costly as jewels--their collection of spices imported\nfrom the East.\n\nSimon had just a glimpse of the ruddy face with its broken nose before\nthe crossbowman-troubadour fell to his knees and thumped his forehead on\nthe brick floor.\n\n_Perhaps I could pop Sordello into that cooking pot and be done with him\nfor good and all._\n\n\"Thank you, Your Signory, for being willing to see me,\" came the muffled\nvoice from the floor. \"You are far kinder than I deserve.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am,\" said Simon brusquely. \"Get up. Why have you come to me?\"\n\nSordello rocked back on his heels and sprang to his feet in a single,\nsurprising motion. Simon told himself to be wary. It was all very well\nto be gruff with Sordello, but he must keep in mind that the man was a\nfighter, a murderer. And one with a vile and overquick temper, as he had\nproved in Venice.\n\n\"I have no one else to go to.\" Sordello spread his empty hands. He had\ngrown a short, ragged black beard, Simon noticed. He wore no hat or\ncloak, and his tunic and hose were stained and tattered. His tunic hung\nloose, unbelted. No weapons. That made Simon feel a bit easier. The toe\nof one boot was worn through, and the other was bound with a bit of rag\nto hold the sole to the upper.\n\n\"I thought you would see the Count d'Anjou.\" And Simon had half expected\nUncle Charles would send Sordello back with a message insisting Simon\ntake the fellow back into his service.\n\nSordello laughed and nodded. \"Easy to say 'see the Count d'Anjou,' Your\nSignory. Not so easy to do when you are a masterless man with an empty\npurse. The count likes to move about, and quickly at that. But I caught\nup with him at Lyons. He already knew the whole story.\"\n\n\"I wrote to him,\" said Simon.\n\n\"Well, your letter must have been most eloquent, Your Signory, because\nthe count refused to take me back into his service. He called me a fool\nand a few other things and told me I deserved exactly what I got. Told\nme if I wasn't out of the city in an hour he would have me flogged.\"\n\n\"I assumed that the count reposed great confidence in you, and I felt I\nmust convince him that I had done the right thing in dismissing you.\"\nHe sounded in his own ears as if he were apologizing. He reminded\nhimself firmly that the scoundrel had no right to an apology.\n\n\"You convinced him, all right.\" Sordello's manner was becoming less\nhumble by the moment.\n\n_He is either going to attack me or--worse--ask for his position back. I\nmust not be soft with him._\n\n\"Once a man as well known as the Count d'Anjou has expelled you from his\nservice, you can't find a position anywhere in France or Italy,\" said\nSordello. \"Not if your only skills are fighting and singing. I sold my\nhorse in Milan. I walked from there on. I ran out of money in Pisa. I\nstarved and slept in ditches to get here.\"\n\n\"And stole here and there, too, I'll wager,\" said Simon, determined to\nbe hard with Sordello. \"Well, here you are, and why have you come?\" He\nknew the answer perfectly well, and was determined, no matter how the\ntroubadour tried to play on his sympathies, to send him on his way. Even\nif he had wanted to take Sordello back into his service--and he most\ndefinitely did not--the Armenians and the Tartars would never permit his\npresence among them. At any rate, regardless of what Sordello claimed,\nhe would not starve. He could sing for his supper in inns. And Italy's\nstreet-warring families and factions could always use a dagger as quick\nas Sordello's.\n\n\"I could throw my lot in with the Ghibellini, Your Signory, but their\nprospects are poor,\" said Sordello, as if aware of Simon's thoughts.\n\"The day is coming when all of Italy will be in the power of the Count\nd'Anjou. I want to get back into his good graces, and the only way I can\ndo that is through you, Your Signory. If you take me back, he will take\nme back.\"\n\n_David of Trebizond's servant, Giancarlo! Just today, was I not wishing\nI could put someone in the enemy camp?_\n\nSimon stood staring into Sordello's eyes, deliberately making him wait\nfor an answer. The troubadour's eyelids wrinkled down to slits, but he\nheld Simon's gaze.\n\n\"I was going to tell you I had nothing for you.\" Simon saw Sordello's\nface brighten at the hint that Simon would offer him something. \"But\nthere is a way you can serve me.\"\n\nSordello began to smile.\n\n\"It does involve throwing your lot in with the Ghibellini,\" Simon said,\n\"but you will be serving me and, through me, Count Charles. Does that\ninterest you?\"\n\nSordello dropped to his knees, seized Simon's hand, and kissed it with\nrough lips. \"To spy upon them? Your Signory, I was made for such work.\nThank you, thank you for letting me serve you. Command me, Your Signory,\nI beg.\"\n\n\n\n\nXIX\n\n\n\"Are there any great collections of books in Trebizond?\" Fra Tomasso\nleaned forward intently, and his belly, swathed in the white linen robe\nof his order, pushed the small black writing desk toward Daoud.\n\nFra Tomasso's dialect was easy for Daoud to understand. It was the same\nas Lorenzo's, since the friar came from southern Italy. It was the\ndialect Daoud had learned in Egypt.\n\nBut in another sense, conversing with d'Aquino was not at all easy. His\nbody tense, Daoud sat on the edge of his chair, alert for any question\nthat might be meant to trap him. And at the same time, he burned for a\nchance to persuade the stout Dominican to oppose the Tartar alliance. He\nwas both hunted and hunter today.\n\n\"Yes, Father. The basileus of Trebizond--the emperor--has the biggest\nlibrary, with the monks of Mount Gelesias not far behind. Several of the\ngreat families have large collections of very old manuscripts. I am\nafraid I cannot tell you what is in any of those libraries. I know more\nabout spices and silks than I do about books. Is there a particular book\nyou are interested in?\"\n\nDaoud, relieved, watched the round face glow as the Dominican seemed to\nrelish the possibilities. It would never have done to admit it to\nUgolini, but Daoud was not without fear. He realized that a slip might\nlead to his arrest and torture, the end of his mission, and, finally,\ndeath. His head had begun to ache from the effort of posing and\nanswering all questions with care.\n\nBut now he sensed a way of reaching d'Aquino. More than anything else,\nthe man would want books--books that would help him write more books of\nhis own. Perhaps his huge physical appetite was but a reflection of his\nhunger for knowledge.\n\n\"Ah, Messer David.\" He smiled, and Daoud realized that his mouth was not\nsmall--it only looked small because of the round cheeks on either side\nof it. \"There is one book I have heard of that I would give everything I\npossess--if I possessed anything--to own. You are familiar with _the_\nphilosopher, Aristotle?\"\n\nDaoud nodded. How wise it had been of Baibars, he thought, to command\nhim to spend months with a mullah from Andalus who was versed in the\nphilosophies of the Christians and of their Greek and Roman\npredecessors. Daoud had even read works by Aristotle in Arabic.\n\n\"Much of my work, like that of my colleagues, is based on the writings\nof Aristotle,\" d'Aquino went on. \"He has been called the Master of Those\nWho Know. I call him _the_ philosopher. His thought encompassed every\nsubject under the sun--and the sun itself, I believe. The ancient\nwriters refer to a book by Aristotle called in Latin _De Caelestiis, Of\nthe Heavens_. In it _the_ philosopher writes about the movement of\nheavenly bodies, the sun, the stars, and the planets, and their\nrelations with one another. That book disappeared during the long wars\nthat led to the downfall of the Roman Empire. Every time I meet a\ntraveler from some distant part of the world, I ask him about _De\nCaelestiis_.\"\n\n\"Does it tell how the planets rule men's fates?\" Daoud asked.\n\n\"That is a ridiculous, irrational, and superstitious notion.\" Fra\nTomasso waved the suggestion away with a stubby-fingered hand. Daoud\nfelt a cold wave of terror. Had he said something that gave him away?\n\nBut Fra Tomasso, leaning back in his squeaking chair, seemed\nunperturbed. And Daoud remembered that Ugolini studied the influence of\nthe stars on human lives. So it could not be such an un-Christian\nbelief.\n\nThe Dominican pointed over his shoulder to the window of his cell, a\nlarge rectangle cut in the curving whitewashed wall. This was one of the\nfew rooms Daoud had entered in Italy that was not covered with\nidolatrous or obscene paintings, and he liked its austerity. Except, of\ncourse, for the ubiquitous figure of Jesus the Messiah, crucified,\nhanging opposite the window. Daoud tried to avoid looking at the\ncrucifixes because they reminded him of his childhood, but they were\neverywhere in Orvieto.\n\n\"Aristotle reasoned about the relations of the heavenly bodies to one\nanother,\" Fra Tomasso said. \"One account of the _De Caelestiis_ declares\nthat he believed that the sun does not move.\"\n\n\"But we see it move,\" Daoud said, surprised.\n\n\"We think we see it move.\" D'Aquino smiled. \"But have you ever stood on\nthe deck of a galley as it was pulling away from the quay and had the\nfeeling that the quay was moving while the ship was standing still? Well\nthen, what if the earth is moving, just like a ship on whose deck we\nstand, while the sun remains fixed?\"\n\nDaoud thought about the vast and solid earth and the daily journey of\nthe sun like a bright lamp across the sky. It was self-evident which one\nof them moved. But he sensed that Fra Tomasso was in love with this\nidea. He had best not argue too strenuously against it.\n\n\"Ingenious,\" he said.\n\n_Ridiculous_, he thought to himself. _This man dismisses astrology and\napproves greater absurdities._\n\n\"I myself suspected that the sun might be stationary while the earth\nmoves long before I learned that Aristotle might also believe so.\" Fra\nTomasso waved a hand toward the window again. His cell was the top floor\nof one of the towers fortifying the Dominican chapter house, an anthill\nof constant, mysterious activity. D'Aquino's window overlooked the north\nside of Orvieto's wall. There was no covering on the window, and the\nshutters were open to let in the cool mountain air. Daoud gazed upon the\nrolling hills, bright green in the sunlight, beyond Orvieto's\nbattlements. This was a lovely country, he thought. Back in Egypt the\nhills would be brown this time of year.\n\n\"Look how much light and heat we get from the sun,\" Fra Tomasso went on.\n\"Yet, the sun appears small--I can hide it with my thumb.\"\n\n_Your thumb could hide four or five suns._\n\n\"Perhaps it _is_ small,\" Daoud said.\n\n\"If it is as big as it must be to produce such light and heat, it must\nbe very far away--thousands of leagues--to appear so small. But if it is\nthat far away, it must be bigger still, for its heat and light to travel\nsuch a distance. The bigger it is, the farther away it must be--the\nfarther away it is, the bigger it must be. Do you follow? There must be\na strict rule of proportion.\"\n\nDaoud told himself to ignore this nonsense and concentrate on the\nimportant thing--that Fra Tomasso badly wanted a book by this pagan\nphilosopher Aristotle. That book might be the means of winning Fra\nTomasso. Not that he could be crudely bribed, but certainly such a\npresent would favorably dispose him to what Daoud had to say.\n\nAnd he saw another way to make the point he had come to make.\n\n\"It may be, Your Reverence, that the book you want has been lost\nforever. When I spoke of the destruction of Baghdad the other day, I\nshould have mentioned that the Tartars burned there a library rivaled\nonly by the great library of Alexandria in its prime.\"\n\nHis flesh turned cold. That was a mistake. In his zeal he had\nmomentarily forgotten that it was Christians who had destroyed the\nlibrary of Alexandria. As the story was often told in Egypt, when the\nMuslim warriors took Alexandria from the Christians, they found that\nmost of what had once been the world's greatest collection of books had\nbeen used to fuel the fires that warmed the public baths.\n\nBut, to Daoud's relief, Fra Tomasso only shut his eyes and shook his\nhead, his cheeks quivering gently like a bowl of frumenty. \"God forgive\nthe Tartars.\"\n\n\"God will certainly not forgive _us_, Fra Tomasso, if we help the\nTartars to destroy Damascus and Cairo. Or Trebizond and Constantinople.\"\n\nThe Dominican opened his eyes wide. \"Constantinople?\"\n\n\"In the Far East they have taken greater cities and conquered much\nlarger empires.\"\n\nFra Tomasso crossed himself. \"But it is God's will, even as Augustine\ntells us, that cities be destroyed and empires rise and fall. The\nTartars may be the builders of a Christian empire that embraces the\nwhole world.\"\n\n_God forbid it!_ Daoud was becoming exasperated with the fat Dominican's\n\"perhapses\" and \"maybes.\" _Perhaps the earth moves and the sun stands\nstill. Maybe the Tartars are God's means of making the whole world\nChristian._\n\nHe warned himself not to let his anger show. This might seem to be a\npleasant conversation, but actually he was tiptoeing around the edge of\na pit of quicksand.\n\nStill, if this clever, restless mind could be recruited to work against\nthe alliance, how persuasive it would be. Daoud had already noticed that\nmost of the leaders of Christendom listened when d'Aquino spoke. But\nDaoud dared not argue against the belief that God decided the fate of\nnations. He recalled a teaching of his Sufi master, Sheikh Saadi. He\nframed it in his mind to offer to d'Aquino.\n\n\"Your Reverence, truly we must accept as the will of God that which has\nhappened. But to think we can guess what God wills for the future is\nsinful pride. We can be guided only by the knowledge of right and wrong\nHe has implanted in us.\"\n\nD'Aquino let his folded hands rest on the great sphere of his belly. His\nblue eyes gazed off at a point somewhere behind Daoud, whose muscles\ntightened as he waited for the friar to speak. He watched through the\nopen window as a flock of crows circled in the deep-blue sky. They chose\na direction and dwindled to a cloud of black dots over the green hills.\n\nDaoud realized he had been holding his breath. He let it out just as the\nlast crow disappeared.\n\n\"That is well stated,\" said Fra Tomasso. \"I can find no objection to\nthat.\"\n\nElated, Daoud pressed on. \"And it follows that if we think the Tartar\ndestruction of civilization is wrong, we must fight against it.\" He\nhoped he did not sound too eager. D'Aquino would surely be suspicious if\nhe saw how badly Daoud wanted his cooperation.\n\n\"I will have to consider that,\" said Fra Tomasso judiciously. \"But\nperhaps we could teach the Tartars the value of civilization. If we made\nallies of them, we could make it a condition that they not destroy any\nmore of the great cities of the Muslim world. Indeed, our missionaries\nwill be among them. They can point out what should be saved.\"\n\nDaoud's breathing quickened as rage rumbled up inside him. It sounded\nexactly as if Fra Tomasso meant that the Tartars could slaughter all the\npeople of Islam as long as they left the libraries intact. Using the\nHashishiyya technique called \"the Face of Steel within the Mask of\nClay,\" he walled off his anger.\n\nHe would not contradict Fra Tomasso's last idea. He would try instead to\nmake the beginning of a bargain.\n\n\"Those libraries of Trebizond you asked me about,\" Daoud said. \"I am\nsure there are many books in them that exist nowhere else in the world.\nPerhaps even the book you mentioned, that rare book of Aristotle. Would\nyou write down its name for me, Fra Tomasso? I will inquire about it in\nmy next report to my trading partners.\"\n\nThe Dominican leaned forward until most of his belly disappeared below\nthe horizon of his desk. In that position he was able to pull the desk\ncloser and search it for a blank slip of parchment. He dipped his quill\nceremoniously in his inkpot, wrote briefly, then carefully poured fine\nwhite sand from a jar to absorb the excess ink. Daoud rose to take the\nparchment from him.\n\n_Now, if only such a book exists somewhere in the lands where Baibars's\npower runs. And if only the weather on the Middle Sea allows us to get\nthe book here quickly. And if only it has the effect on Fra Tomasso that\nI want._\n\nSo many ifs. Far too many. The outcome of a battle would be easier to\npredict. For the thousandth time Daoud wished he were leading troops in\nthe field rather than intriguing in the chambers of enemy leaders.\n\n\"I understand it will be possible to meet the two Tartars when the\nContessa di Monaldeschi gives a reception in their honor next week,\"\nsaid Daoud. \"Will Your Reverence be attending?\"\n\nFra Tomasso nodded. \"But I also intend to talk with them privately as I\nhave with you.\" Daoud tensed inwardly as he heard that. \"It will be\ninteresting, though, to see how they comport themselves in a gathering,\"\nthe Dominican went on. \"Yes, I shall come to the contessa's. And you?\"\n\n\"As Cardinal Ugolini's guest,\" said Daoud with modesty. \"And what of the\nexecution of the heretic who threatened the ambassadors in the\ncathedral? Will Your Reverence witness that? I understand it should be a\nmost edifying spectacle.\" He folded Fra Tomasso's bit of parchment and\nthrust it into the pouch at his belt.\n\nFra Tomasso shook his head. \"The good of the community demands that we\nmake an example of the poor creature. He refuses to admit his errors.\nStill, I cannot stand to see a fellow human being suffer. I will not be\nthere.\"\n\nSo, thought Daoud contemptuously, the fat Dominican was one of those who\ncould justify the shedding of blood but could not stand to see it shed.\nAnd in the same way, d'Aquino might decide to be for war or for peace\nand never see the consequences of his decision. Daoud might wish to lead\ntroops in battle, but he reminded himself that it was in studios like\nthis, where men of influence thought and read and argued, that the real\nwar was being fought.\n\n\n\n\nXX\n\n\nThe madman had a loud voice. Daoud could hear him long before he could\nsee the victim and his torturers. The people around Daoud jostled and\ncraned their necks toward the sound of the screams.\n\nThe heretic, in accordance with his sentence, had been dragged through\nevery street in the city and tormented at every intersection, but most\nof Orvieto's citizens had been waiting in the Piazza San Giovenale to\nsee his final agonies before the cathedral he had desecrated. The piazza\nwas so packed with people it seemed not another person could squeeze in.\n\nDaoud had positioned himself at the foot of the front steps of the\ncathedral. He faced a wooden platform, newly built in the center of the\npiazza, on four legs twice the height of a man. Above the platform rose\na tall pole. The whole structure was of white wood, unseasoned and\nunpainted--which was only sensible, since it would shortly be destroyed.\nBundles of firewood were piled under it.\n\nDaoud's arms were wedged so tightly to his side by the crowd of people\nstanding about him that it was an effort for him to wipe his face with\nhis sleeve. He had expected Italy to be cooler than Egypt now, in the\nmiddle of the Christian month of September, but the damp heat of summer\nlingered. Thick gray clouds hung low over the city. Sweat streamed from\nunder Daoud's red velvet cap, and he wished he could wear a turban or a\nburnoose to keep his forehead cool and dry.\n\nAt the top of the cathedral steps, in a space cleared by papal guards,\nstood six red-robed cardinals. Ugolini was among them. He had not wanted\nto witness the execution, but Daoud had persuaded him to go. His\npresence, like Daoud's, might counter the suspicion that those who\nopposed the alliance with the Tartars were connected with the\ndisturbances against them.\n\nNear Ugolini stood Cardinal Paulus de Verceuil, the Tartars' chief\nsupporter in the Sacred College, in a scarlet robe trimmed with ermine,\nand a broad-brimmed red hat. He looked disdainfully down at another\ncardinal who Ugolini had pointed out to Daoud as Guy le Gros, also a\nFrenchman. Every so often de Verceuil would cock an ear to the screams,\nwhich were coming closer, or he would glance that way with bright, eager\neyes.\n\nBehind the cardinals stood a man-at-arms holding a staff bearing the\npope's standard, a gold and white banner blazoned with the crossed keys\nof Peter in red. Ugolini had learned from the pope's majordomo that His\nHoliness would not attend. Like Fra Tomasso, Urban had neither need nor\ndesire to see this execution.\n\nOne who did have to witness the torture and death of the heretic stood\nwith folded arms on the cathedral steps. He was stocky and much shorter\nthan the two guards in yellow and blue, the city colors, who stood\nholding halberds on either side of him. His face was grim, and there\nwere deep shadows around his eyes. A small, thin mustache adorned his\nupper lip. Daoud knew him to be Frescobaldo d'Ucello, podesta of\nOrvieto.\n\nDaoud's eye moved on. There was the young hero, the man who had captured\nthe would-be assassin. Count Simon de Gobignon stood a little apart from\nthe churchmen and the podesta, speaking to no one. It seemed he had\nbrought none of his Frankish henchmen with him. The black velvet cap he\nwore and his long dark-brown hair contrasted with the pallor of his thin\nface. His dress was rich but somber, his silk mantle a deep maroon, his\ntunic purple. His gloved left hand played nervously with the hilt of his\nsword, that very sword that had stricken the blade from the heretic's\nhand.\n\nIt was surprising, Daoud thought, that the count's sword was a long,\ncurving scimitar with a jeweled scabbard and hilt. What was the boy\ndoing with a Muslim sword? A trophy of some past crusade, no doubt.\n\n_Not enjoying your triumph here today, are you, young Frank? Born to\nrank and power and wealth, with castles and knights and servants and\nlands all around you. You have probably never seen a battle, much less\nfought in one. And yet, knowing not what war is, you try to bring\ntogether the Tartar hordes and your crusader knights that they may lay\nwaste my country, kill my people, and stamp out my faith._\n\nRecalling how he and de Gobignon had faced each other at the pope's\ncouncil, Daoud once again felt rage boil up within him and wondered why\nhe hated the young nobleman so. Was it because he intended to use\nSophia to spy on de Gobignon and corrupt him, and that she must bed with\nhim? But that was her work, Daoud tried to tell himself, just as warfare\nwas his.\n\nBut was this warfare? To pander to a fat friar's yearning for an old\nbook? To send a lovely woman to the bed of a spoiled young nobleman? To\nincite a poor fool, maddened by God, into getting himself tortured to\ndeath? Daoud wished he could fight openly--draw his sword and challenge\nde Gobignon. To drive him to his knees, to cut him down, to strike and\nstrike for the people he loved and for God.\n\n_To kill him before all, as I did to Kassar._\n\nDaoud, like de Gobignon, was alone. Lorenzo dared not come; the\ncondemned man might recognize him and call out to him. Daoud would never\nbring Sophia to witness such a sight, even though there were many women,\nand even children, in the crowd.\n\nThe previous night Tilia had told him that she had rented for the day a\nhouse overlooking the piazza, from which some important patrons would\nenhance their pleasure with Tilia's women by watching the pain of the\nheretic. Daoud looked around at the colonnaded fa\u00e7ades of the palaces\naround the square, wondering which were the windows through which\nTilia's depraved clients watched.\n\nA howl went up from the crowd in the square, the people around Daoud\nshouting so loudly as to deafen him. He saw a cage made of wooden poles\nrocking into the piazza. People cheered and laughed. Two executioners in\nblood-red tunics, their heads and faces covered with red hoods, stood on\neither side of the cage, each man holding in his hands a pair of\nlong-handled pincers. Standing on tiptoe, Daoud saw on the platform of\nthe cart a black iron dish from which ribbons of gray smoke arose.\n\nThe prisoner, squatting in the cage, was silent for the moment. Even at\nthis distance Daoud could see his shoulders shaking spasmodically with\nhis panting. He was naked, and all over his flesh were bleeding,\nblackened wounds.\n\nThe executioners thrust the ends of their pincers into the coals and\nheld them there. When they raised them out and brandished them, the\nclaws were glowing red. They turned to the prisoner, who started\nscreaming at once. One executioner thrust his pincers through the front\nof the cage. The prisoner tried to back away, but the cage was too\nsmall. He only pressed his buttocks against the bars behind him, where\nthe other executioner had crept and now dug the jaws of his pincers into\nthe man's flesh as the crowd roared with laughter. Daoud heard the\nsizzle. The man's scream rose to a pitch that made Daoud's ears ring.\nThe executioner held up his pincers with a gobbet of burnt flesh caught\nin them for the crowd to see, then slung them so that the bit of meat\nflew through the air. Daoud saw people reach up to grab at it.\n\n_This man is dying horribly because of me._ The thought bit into Daoud's\nheart like the red-hot claws. When Sophia had said as much accusingly to\nhim, he had shrugged it off. Now he had to face the fact.\n\n_Let your guilt pierce you through the heart. Do not armor yourself\nagainst it. Do not run away from it. Above all, do not turn your back on\nit._ So Saadi had advised him after he avenged himself on Kassar.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe sands of the Eastern Desert were the color of drying blood. The\nhooves of Daoud's pony sank into them with each step, and he wished he\nhad a camel to ride.\n\nTheir training troop had never traveled this far south, and Nicetas had\nbeen a fool, Daoud thought, to go hunting in unknown and dangerous\ncountry with only a pony to ride. No wonder he had not come back\nyesterday. Probably, the sun had killed the pony, and Nicetas was\ncrouched in some wadi waiting to be rescued.\n\n_I should have gone with him._\n\nBut they had been friends, and more than friends, for two years, and\nfrom time to time each needed to be alone. They both understood that.\nAnd so, when the naqeeb Mahmoud gave them a day of rest after the trek\ndown from El Kahira, and Nicetas said he wanted to go out alone to get\nhimself a pair of antelope horns, Daoud simply hugged him and sent him\non his way.\n\nDaoud felt the murderous heat of the noon sun on his head through his\nburnoose. Ten times hotter here than at El Kahira, now a hundred leagues\nto the north. The wind filled the air with red dust, and he had wrapped\na scarf over his nose and mouth. Only his eyes were exposed, looking for\nNicetas.\n\n_Antelope horns! Not even a lizard could live in this desert._\n\nHe should get into the shade, but he did not want to stop searching. If\nNicetas were hurt and lying out in this sun, it would burn him to death.\nDaoud saw a line of sharp-pointed hills off to his left. There was shade\nthere, and Nicetas would try to reach shade. He tapped his pony's\nshoulder lightly with his switch and turned its head toward the hills.\n\nNearly there, he saw what looked like a black rock half-buried ahead of\nhim. Could it be a body? For a moment his heart hammered. No, it was too\nbig. His pony floundered on through the sand till they reached the dark\nshape.\n\nIt was Nicetas's pony, dead. Windblown sand half covered it, but he was\nsure of it. Nicetas's pony was black.\n\nDaoud swung down from his horse, looping the reins around his wrist so\nit could not run off, and knelt to examine the dead pony. He brushed\naway sand from the forehead. Three white dots; he knew those markings\nwell.\n\nHe scooped sand away from the dead pony and found an arrow jutting out\nof the chest. In spite of the fiery sun his body went cold. Wild\nSudanese were said to prowl this desert.\n\nHe jerked on the arrow. It had gone in deep, and the head must be broad.\nIt took him long to tear it free.\n\nThe head was wedge-shaped and made of steel, with sword-sharp edges.\nSudanese tribesmen had no such arrows. Even Mamelukes had only a few.\nEach Mameluke carried two or three, to use against a well-armored\nopponent.\n\n\"Oh, God, help me find Nicetas,\" he prayed.\n\nNicetas was out there somewhere. Daoud pushed out of his mind the\nthought that he might be dead.\n\nWas this punishment for their sin of loving each other, he wondered as\nhe mounted his little horse. God frowned on men lying with men, the\nmullahs said, but everyone knew that men, especially young men far from\nwomen, often took comfort in one another.\n\nHe pulled his burnoose farther down over his eyes to shade them better\nagainst the sun. He wanted water, but he would not let himself drink\nuntil he had reached the hills. He might find Nicetas there, and Nicetas\nmight need the water.\n\nThe hills thrust abruptly out of the sand in long vertical folds. Half\nblinded by the glare, he could see only opaque blackness where the sun\ndid not strike them.\n\nHe thought he saw movement in one shadow. He kicked the pony, driving it\nto struggle faster through the sand, keeping his eyes fixed on the spot.\n\nA deep crevice sliced into the hillside. Daoud rode into it cautiously.\nWhoever killed Nicetas's mount might still be somewhere about.\n\nOnce out of the sun, he slid down from the saddle. He saw no water, but\nthere was a dead tamarisk, its branches like supplicating arms, at the\nmouth of the crevice. He tied the pony to a limb and moved, slowly,\ndeeper into the shadow.\n\nHe looked down at the floor of the crevice, paved with drifting sand and\ntiny pebbles. He felt a pain in his heart as he saw a trail of dark\ncircular spots, each about the size of his hand. It could be a wounded\nanimal, he told himself.\n\nThen he saw a palmprint, the same dried color, and the pain in his heart\nsharpened.\n\nHe saw the movement again, at the far end of the crevice. A figure lay\nwith its legs stretched out before it, its back propped against the\nbrown stone. Pale hands were clasped over its stomach.\n\nHe heard a low, moaning sound, and realized it was coming not from\nNicetas but from his own mouth.\n\nDaoud ran and fell to his knees beside him. The half-open eyes widened\nand the amber gaze turned in his direction. The Greek boy's face was\nreddened with dust that clung to his sweat. His lips, partially open,\nwere so dry and encrusted they looked like scabs. Daoud put his hand on\nNicetas's cheeks. His face was burning.\n\nNow the hurt in Daoud's heart was like death itself.\n\n_I am going to lose him._\n\nBut this was no time to wail and weep. He must do everything he could.\nIt might yet be God's will that he save his friend.\n\n_Let him live, oh God, and I will never sin with him again._\n\n\"I knew you would come.\" The voice was so faint Daoud could barely hear\nit above the wind whistling past the mouth of the crevice.\n\nDaoud sprang to his feet and ran to his pony to get his water bottle. He\nuntwisted the stopper over his friend's mouth.\n\nThe Greek boy shook his head. \"I cannot swallow. Just pour a little in\nmy mouth to wet it.\" Daoud saw deep red cracks in Nicetas's lips. The\nwater trickled out the corners of his mouth and streaked his dusty\ncheeks.\n\nA hundred half-formed thoughts crowded Daoud's mind. His eyes burned,\nand pain pounded at his chest.\n\nAll he said was \"What happened to you?\"\n\n\"It was Kassar,\" Nicetas whispered. \"He got me with his first arrow.\nThen he shot the pony and it fell on me. He rode me down. He took my bow\nbefore I could get free.\"\n\n_After all this time!_ Daoud thought. Kassar had said nothing, done\nnothing, since the day Nicetas beat him at casting the rumh.\n\nTwo years Kassar had waited.\n\nHe bent forward to take Nicetas in his arms, but the Greek boy shook his\nhead. \"Do not move me. It will hurt too much.\"\n\n\"Where are you hit?\"\n\n\"In my back. Still in me. I broke off the shaft.\"\n\n_Why was I such a fool, to think we were safe?_\n\n\"It can't be a very bad wound.\"\n\nNicetas closed his eyes. \"Bad enough that he could use me for his\npleasure and I could not fight him off.\"\n\nA dizzying blackness blinded Daoud. His skull felt as if it were going\nto burst.\n\n\"By God and the Prophet, I will kill him.\"\n\n\"I want you to.\"\n\n\"Did he do any more to hurt you?\"\n\n\"Yes, he got me here.\" He parted his hands and raised them from his\nstomach. His white cotton robe was caked with black blood, and there was\na tear in the center. The wound was not wide, but Daoud knew that it\nmust be very deep.\n\n\"He made sure to use his rumh, you see.\"\n\n\"Because that was how you beat him.\"\n\nDaoud wanted only to hold Nicetas and cry, but he sensed that what would\nmost comfort the Greek boy would be talking about what happened to him.\n\n\"After the rumh, I lay very still and held my breath. He thought I was\ndead. He left me lying there with the pony. Took my weapons and my water\nbottle. I crawled here. In the sun. Yesterday afternoon. I bled and\nbled.\"\n\n_He is going to die_, Daoud thought. He did not want to believe it. For\na moment he was angry at Nicetas. Why had he been such a fool as to come\nout here alone? And then at himself. Why had he let him go?\n\nAnd then at God.\n\n_Why did You let this happen? Do You hate us because we love each\nother?_\n\n\"I knew you would come for me, Daoud. I stayed alive to greet you.\"\n\nDaoud took Nicetas's hand. \"I will take you back.\"\n\n\"No. Bury me out here. Let him think you never found me. Bide your time,\nas he did. Give him no reason to fear you. He fears you already, or he\nwould never have done it this way.\"\n\n\"Before the year is out, you will look down from paradise and see him\nburning in hell.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry. I was never strong enough to be a Mameluke.\"\n\n\"No. You _are_ strong.\"\n\n\"Not strong enough to live,\" said Nicetas, so faintly Daoud could hardly\nhear him. \"Good-bye, Daoud. Remember the Greek I taught you. You may\nmeet someone else who speaks Greek.\"\n\n\"I will never meet anyone like you.\" The tears spilled out over his\neyelids, and he did not try to brush them away. The hand he held\nsqueezed his, weakly, then relaxed.\n\nDaoud bent forward and touched his mouth to the split, dust-coated lips.\nNo breath came from his friend's body. A curtain of shadow swept before\nhis eyes, and he thought he was going to faint.\n\nHe thrust himself to his feet as Nicetas's head fell to one side.\n\nHe threw his arms over his head and screamed.\n\nArms still upraised, he dropped to his knees.\n\n\"Oh, God!\" His voice echoed back from the walls of the crevice. \"God,\nGod, God!\"\n\nThe pain in his heart was as if a rumh had impaled it. He felt that he\nmust die, too. He could not bear this loss. Never to see his friend\nsmile again, never to hear his laughter. That body he had loved, nothing\nnow but unmoving, empty clay.\n\nHe looked over at Nicetas, hoping to see a movement, the flicker of an\neyelid, the rising of the chest. Nothing. Daoud would never again look\non in admiration as the Greek boy rode wildly, standing in the stirrups\nshooting his arrows at the gallop or casting his spear unerringly at the\ntarget. They would never, as he had dreamed, ride side by side into\nbattle.\n\nDaoud crumpled to the ground in the position of worship, his forehead\npressed against the sharp, broken stones. But he was not worshiping. He\nsimply did not have the strength to hold himself upright.\n\nIt seemed hours later when he at last stirred himself. Sobbing, he\ncarried Nicetas out to a place near the mouth of the crevice, where the\nsand had drifted in, and with his hands he dug there a grave. All along\nthe base of the hillside were many loose brown stones, chipped away by\nthe eternal wind. With bleeding hands he piled the stones high over\nNicetas's body, but tried to make the pile look like a rock slide, so\nthat no one would know someone was buried here. He knelt, weeping and\ntalking to Nicetas's spirit, until the sun was low in the west.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs Nicetas had told him to do, Daoud had pretended, when he came back\nfrom the desert, that he had no idea what had happened to his friend.\nThe naqeeb had declared that Sudanese tribesmen or wild animals must\nhave gotten him. Daoud was not alone in his grief. Many of the boys in\nthe troop had liked Nicetas.\n\nEven Kassar had said words of sympathy, his face expressionless and his\nslanted eyes opaque. Daoud held in his rage, a white-hot furnace in his\nheart, and in a choked voice he thanked Kassar.\n\nAt first he went about in a daze, unable to think. He told himself that\nin spite of his dissembling, Kassar would be on guard. He would have to\nchoose a time to take his revenge when Kassar would be preoccupied. And\nDaoud himself must be alert at all times. Kassar might not be satisfied\nwith killing only Nicetas. In spite of these warnings to himself,\nDaoud's mind remained numb. He was, he told himself, like a mall ball,\nhit one way by grief, the other way by rage, unable to take control of\nhis destiny.\n\nThat thought of mall gave him the beginning of a plan.\n\nHe let three months go by from the day he found Nicetas. His plan was\nvery simple. It left much to luck, and it might fail utterly--Kassar\nmight anticipate what he was going to do and turn the moment against\nhim, killing him and claiming he was defending himself. Kassar's friends\nmight thwart Daoud.\n\nHe would have only this one chance. If he failed, he would be dead or\ncrippled. Or worst of all, cast out of the Mamelukes to spend the rest\nof his life as a ghulman, a menial slave. But if he succeeded, Nicetas\nwould be avenged before Baibars and Sultan Qutuz and all Daoud's and\nNicetas's khushdashiya.\n\nWhatever punishment might befall him then, he thought he could bear it\nfor Nicetas's sake.\n\n_The Warrior of God is a man who would give his life for his friends._\n\nOn the day Daoud decided to act, the Bhari Mamelukes, the slaves of the\nRiver, rode out to play mall. Emir Baibars al-Bunduqdari led them across\nthe bridge from Raudha Island to the Nasiri race course, their training\nand playing ground, within sight of the great pyramids built by the\nancient idol-worshipers of Egypt. The people of El Kahira watched with\nshining eyes as their guardians assembled on the field. Baibars's\ntablkhana, his personal mounted band, playing trumpets and kettledrums,\ncymbals and hautboys, rode before them. Sultan al-Mudhaffar Qutuz came\ndown from the citadel of El Kahira to watch the games as the guest of\nhis Mamelukes.\n\nThe troops of julbans, Mamelukes in training, brought up the rear of the\nparade on their little ponies, with their naqeebs riding before them,\nthe oldest boys in the lead and the first- and second-year boys on foot\nat the end. They wore plain brown shirts and white cotton trousers and\ncaps. No special marks of rank were allowed these young slaves until\nthey became full-fledged Mamelukes.\n\nDaoud's troop, the boys in their fifth year of training, rode\nimmediately behind the Mamelukes. Each boy carried a mallet, which was\nas much part of his equipment as his bow, his rumh, his dabbus, and his\nsaif. The mallets were made of cedar and were large and heavy. They had\nto be, to drive a wooden ball half the size of a man's head.\n\nSlaves had pulled perforated water barrels in carts over the field to\nlay the dust. Baibars and the sultan and the highest-ranking emirs\nseated themselves on cushions in an open pavilion facing the center of\nthe field.\n\nDaoud's teammates chattered excitedly. They loved mall, and to play\nbefore the sultan was a special honor. Kassar, the captain of their\nteam, boasted that he would make ten goals that day. Theirs was to be\nthe second match.\n\nHefting his mallet, Daoud watched the first match, also between two\nteams of fifth-year trainees. Each team of eight riders tried to drive\nthe wooden ball between a pair of stone pillars painted with red and\nyellow stripes, defended by the other team. With every crack of a mallet\nagainst the ball, a roar went up from the watching Mamelukes.\n\nA judge with an hourglass called time halfway through the match, to let\nthe field be watered again and the teams change ponies. By the end of\nthe match, the dust was so thick Daoud could not see who had won. But he\ndid not care. He felt utterly calm. He was past anger and past fear. He\nthought only of watching for the right moment.\n\nNow it was time for their team.\n\nKassar, Daoud, and the other six riders lined up on the east side of the\nfield, the eight members of the troop they were playing against forming\non the other side.\n\nThe judge set the wooden ball, yellow with a bright red stripe around\nits middle, in the center of the field. The sultan held out a blue silk\nscarf and dropped it. Kassar and the captain of the other team raced at\nthe ball from opposite goals, screaming their war cries. Kassar whirled\nhis mallet over his head, and his pony's legs were a blur in the dust.\nHe reached the ball an instant before his opponent. His mallet slammed\ninto the ball with a crack like the splitting of a board, and the ball\nflew halfway toward the enemy goal.\n\nThe ball was in play, and now the other riders could join in.\n\n_You will make not even one goal today, Kassar_, Daoud thought as he\ngalloped across the field with his team.\n\nThe players on the other side were trying to hit the ball away from\ntheir goal. Kassar had ridden into their midst, his pony nimbly\nfollowing the ball. He held his mallet low to hit through the legs of\nthe opposing team's ponies. Two of the opponents had stayed back by\ntheir goalposts to deflect the ball should Kassar hit it.\n\nKassar was on top of the ball. Daoud kicked his pony's ribs hard and\ngalloped after him.\n\nAs Kassar swung low from his saddle to hit the ball, Daoud drove in on\nhim. Kassar glanced up, fear flashing across his broad face. Whatever\npassed through his mind was his last thought. Daoud swung his mallet up\nfrom the ground, smashing it into Kassar's jaw. The force of the blow\nknocked the white cap from his head. His pony ran free of the melee.\nKassar reeled, unconscious, but his horse nomad's instinct held him in\nthe saddle.\n\nDaoud jerked his pony around to race after Kassar. In an instant he was\nbeside his enemy.\n\nHe was about to kill a khushdashiyin, a barracks comrade, in open\ndefiance of the code of the Mamelukes and in front of his emir and his\nsultan.\n\n_I am a dead man_, he thought as he swung the mallet high.\n\nHis body felt cold as death, and he hesitated. As he did so, Kassar\nturned his head, and Daoud saw consciousness struggling to return to his\nglazed eyes.\n\nThis was Daoud's last chance to avenge Nicetas.\n\nHe heard a distant roar of command from the naqeeb Mahmoud, but he\nignored it.\n\nHe brought the mallet down with all his strength on the Kipchaq's\nglistening black hair. The shock of the contact ran up his arm and into\nhis shoulder. Kassar started to fall. Daoud struck again with the\nmallet.\n\nKassar pitched from his pony's back. As he struck the ground, Daoud\nsmashed the mallet into his head a third time, just as if he were\nhitting a ball. He tried to hit hard enough to knock Kassar's head\nright off his neck. Daoud saw the head suddenly distorted, flattening,\nand knew the skull was crushed. Kassar lay on the ground on his back,\nonly the whites of his eyes showing, his mouth hanging open. Dust half\nobscured his body.\n\nDaoud heard shouts from the bystanders, but he paid no attention to what\nthey were saying. He saw riders, the other players, racing toward him.\n\nA silence fell on the playing field.\n\n\"Get down from your horse.\" It was Mahmoud, who had run out into the\nfield on foot.\n\nAs Daoud and Mahmoud walked across the field, the naqeeb said, \"You will\nanswer to El Malik Qutuz and to Emir Baibars for this. Fool, whatever\nyour quarrel was, could you not have settled it in private? Have you\nforgotten that Baibars is a Kipchaq? He will not forgive you.\"\n\nDespite his joy at seeing Nicetas's murderer dead, Daoud now felt terror\nclutching his throat as he approached the two seated figures in their\nsplendid robes at the side of the field. Now that the deed was done and\ncould not be undone, he dreaded facing these two mighty judges.\n\n_Baibars is a Kipchaq, but it was Baibars who bought me for the\nMamelukes_, Daoud thought. _I wonder which will mean more to him this\nday._\n\nBaibars and Qutuz sat side by side on cushions in the shade of a silken\ncanopy. Baibars wore an egret's plume, symbol of valor, on his green\nturban. His wide, harsh mouth was tight under the red mustache, his good\neye as empty of feeling as the blind one that was crossed by a vertical\nsaber scar.\n\n_Beneficent God, if I must die for what I have done, let it be a quick\nand clean death. And then I will join Nicetas._\n\nEl Malik al-Mudhaffar Qutuz, Sultan of El Kahira, a Mameluke of a\nKurdish tribe, was somewhat older than Baibars. His face was\ncriss-crossed with tiny wrinkles. His beard, greased so that it jutted\nlike the prow of a galley, was such a flat black that it must surely be\ndyed. He wore a large black turban and full black robes with gold\nembroidery.\n\nDaoud fell to his knees and prostrated himself before the sultan.\n\n\"Get up and take off your cap,\" said Qutuz without preliminary. Daoud\nrose to his feet, lifting his cap from his head.\n\n\"Look at that blond hair,\" said Qutuz wonderingly. \"I thought he had the\nlook of a Frank about him, Bunduqdari.\"\n\n\"I could have told you that,\" said Baibars flatly. \"He belongs to me. He\nis known as Daoud ibn Abdallah. His parents were Franks. We took him\nwhen we freed Ascalon.\" He talked to Qutuz, Daoud noted, as if they were\nequals.\n\nBaibars turned his one eye on Daoud. \"Why did you do this?\" he said\nsoftly. \"You are not a fool, and you would not kill out of foolishness.\"\n\n\"Effendi, he killed my friend,\" said Daoud, making himself stand\nstraight and look levelly at Baibars. The emir might sentence him to\ndeath, but he would show himself a true Mameluke. He would not cringe or\nbeg. He would honor Nicetas.\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\nDaoud told Baibars how he had found Nicetas in the desert and what he\nhad said to him. He kept his voice level, trying not to let his fear\nshow.\n\n\"You should have reported this to me!\" shouted Naqeeb Mahmoud, his white\nbeard quivering. The naqeeb would bear some blame, Daoud thought, for\nthis breach of discipline.\n\nBut Daoud only turned to him and threw his own words back at him, \"Among\nMamelukes, he who is strongest rules.\"\n\nPerhaps he should not be so defiant, he thought. Both the sultan and\nBaibars liked to show themselves to be men of great generosity.\n\n_Yes, but not to a julban who has broken the law._\n\n\"He cannot kill his comrade and go unpunished,\" said Qutuz. \"He should\nbe beheaded.\"\n\nAt the words, even though he had thought himself prepared for them,\nDaoud felt something shrink with dread inside him. He felt the blade\nslicing through his neck. The sultan had spoken. His life was over.\n\n\"He is too valuable to be beheaded,\" said Baibars. \"Believe me, My\nLord.\"\n\n_Valuable?_\n\nDaoud felt as if he had fallen from a cliff and a strong hand had\nreached out and was dragging him back. He was breathless with a relief\nhe barely dared to feel. He tried to keep his face and body still as the\ntwo great ones debated his fate, but he could not stop his fists from\nclenching.\n\nThe sultan's eyes narrowed, and a deep crease appeared between his brows\nas he turned to Baibars. \"Is this Frankish murderer a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of yours,\nthen?\"\n\nBaibars nodded. \"I have seen reason to take a personal interest in him,\nif it please My Lord.\"\n\nWhat did that mean? What had Baibars seen in him that day in the slave\nmarket, and why had Baibars come there that day?\n\n_I have long watched for such a one as you, who could have the outward\nlook of a Christian knight but the mind and heart of a Mameluke. One\nlike you could be a great weapon against the enemies of the faith._\n\n\"It does not please me,\" said Qutuz shortly. \"There is too much breaking\nof rules among the Bhari Mamelukes.\" He spoke, Daoud thought, as if he\nwere not originally a Mameluke himself.\n\n\"There is a law among Mamelukes more binding than any lesser rule,\" said\nBaibars quietly. \"He who feels himself greatly sinned against must\nstrike back. If he cannot do that, he is not enough of a man to be a\nMameluke. Even as this foolish boy said, the strong must rule.\"\n\nDaoud saw grave approval in Baibars's brown face and realized that it\ndid not matter at all to Baibars that Kassar was a Kipchaq. His joy grew\nas he realized that he had Baibars on his side.\n\nDaoud remembered Nicetas's dying words--_I am not strong enough to be a\nMameluke_.\n\n_But together we were strong enough to do what had to be done._\n\nQutuz said, \"If all Mamelukes believed only in the rule of the\nstrongest, we would have chaos.\"\n\n\"Only if it were not certain who _is_ strongest,\" said Baibars quietly.\n\nBaibars and Qutuz sat looking at each other in a grave and thoughtful\nsilence that seemed to stretch on forever. Finally, Qutuz turned away.\n\n\"I must allow you to discipline the Bhari Mamelukes--or not discipline\nthem--as you see fit, Bunduqdari. That is your responsibility.\"\n\n\"Thank you, My Lord,\" said Baibars with just a hint of sarcasm.\n\nHe turned to Mahmoud. \"Take him away.\"\n\nDaoud crossed the field, walking beside Mahmoud, wondering how his\nkhushdashiya, clustered together around what had been their goal, would\ngreet him.\n\n_I have killed Kassar_, Daoud thought. _I have taken a life._ It was the\nfirst time, and he felt glad and proud.\n\nBut he would gladly give up this proud moment to have Nicetas back. His\ngrief for Nicetas was sharp as ever, not at all eased by vengeance.\n\n_Is it wrong to have done as I did and to feel this way?_\n\nA sharp voice rang out behind them. \"Mahmoud!\"\n\nDaoud and the naqeeb turned together, and Daoud was amazed to see that\nBaibars, splendid in his red satin robe and green turban, was\napproaching them. Daoud and Mahmoud rushed to stand before him, rigid\nand trembling.\n\n\"Mahmoud,\" Baibars said, \"when we return to Raudha Island tonight, you\nwill issue this fool the steel helmet of a full-fledged Mameluke,\ntrimmed with black fur.\"\n\nHe swung that searching blue eye back to Daoud. \"Tonight at the Gray\nMosque I will perform the ceremony that frees you. You will be a part of\nmy personal guard from now on.\"\n\nDizzy with exultation, Daoud fell to his knees and pressed his forehead\nto the cool brown earth before the emir. Tears burned his eyes and\ndripped to the ground.\n\n\"May God praise and bless you, Emir Baibars!\" he cried.\n\n\"Get up,\" Baibars said briskly. \"Had you let your friend go unavenged, I\nwould no longer be interested in you.\"\n\nAs he scrambled to his feet, Daoud saw Mahmoud smiling through his\nbeard.\n\n\"You learned well the lesson I tried to teach you.\"\n\nDizzy, Daoud tried to grasp what had been going on in the minds of these\nmen without his realizing it.\n\nBaibars said, \"Now you must learn to kill with more grace and subtlety.\nI shall see that you are trained by masters, as I did when I sent you to\nSheikh Abu Hamid al-Din Saadi.\"\n\n_And I must go to Sheikh Saadi again_, thought Daoud. _That he may tell\nme if I did wrong._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNow it was over ten years since Kassar had killed Nicetas and Daoud had\nkilled Kassar. And though Daoud had never felt guilty for killing\nKassar, he understood what Saadi meant about facing guilt.\n\nIf he had not understood, he might have told himself that it was not his\nfault, it was these Christian brutes who chose to torment the poor\nmadman in this way. He might have told himself that Lorenzo, not he, had\nfound the man and brought him to Orvieto. He might simply have said, as\nhe had said to Sophia, that in war there must be innocent victims. He\nmight have reminded himself that he and Lorenzo thought that the man\nwould only raise a commotion in the church, not that he would draw a\nknife.\n\nAnd if he consented to any of those thoughts, he would have been\npinching off a fragment of his soul, just as the executioners pinched\noff bits of this man's body.\n\nHe forced himself to watch as the cage moved slowly into the piazza and\nthe executioners tore again and again at the victim's body with their\nred-hot pincers. He saw now that six laughing, well-dressed young men\nwere pulling the cart. Of course. No beast, its nostrils assailed by the\nsmell of burning flesh and its ears by the victim's howls of agony,\ncould remain calm and pull a cart through this frenzied crowd.\n\nThese were the same people who had rioted against the Tartars a month\nago, the day this man was arrested. Now they cheered and jeered at the\ndeath of the Tartars' assailant. And that meant, Daoud thought, that the\nman's death was in vain.\n\nThe cage drew near him now as it approached the scaffold. Daoud held his\nbreath at the thought that the condemned man might look him in the eye.\n_How could I bear that?_ But the man's eyes, he saw, were squeezed shut\nwith fear and pain.\n\nAnd guilt continued to cut into Daoud like the twisting knife blade of a\nHashishiyyin.\n\n_A better man than I would have found a way to stir the people and keep\nthem stirred, so that lives would not be wasted._\n\nThe two red-garbed executioners had set aside their red-hot pincers and\nwere dragging the heretic up the ladder to the scaffold. His feet\ndangled on the rungs. On the platform stood another man waiting for the\nvictim.\n\nDaoud felt his eyes open wide and his lips begin to work silently when\nhe saw who the third executioner was.\n\nHis face was left bare by the executioner's black hood, whose long point\nhung down the side of his head past his chin. No use to mask this man's\nface; his body made him instantly recognizable to anyone who had ever\nseen him before.\n\nHe smiled a serene, almost kindly smile down at the moaning man who was\nbeing dragged up the ladder toward him. He held a cook's knife in one\nhand with a blade as wide as his wrist and as long as his forearm. If he\nwere not holding the knife up to display it to his victim, the tip of it\nwould have rested on the platform, because the executioner's back was\nbent forward as if it had been broken in some accident long ago.\n\n_The firewood seller at Lucera!_\n\nDaoud's head swam as he tried to fathom how the crippled dwarf who had\nbeen part of the crowd of tradesmen entering the great Hohenstaufen\nstronghold with him, who had witnessed Daoud's arrest by Celino at the\ngate and even seemed to pray in his behalf, could be here conducting a\npublic execution in the city of the pope. He must have been a Guelfo\nspy, by coincidence infiltrating Lucera at the same time as Daoud.\n\nHe had been in Manfred's pastry kitchen. Had he really been sleeping, or\nhad he seen Manfred, Lorenzo, and Daoud walk through together?\n\n_If he sees me here in the crowd, he will expose me!_ The people around\nDaoud, their breath reeking of onions and garlic, pressed him so tightly\nhe could barely move. Twisting his body, he managed to get his back\nturned to the scaffold. This put him face-to-face with a\nbroad-shouldered man in a mud-brown tunic, with a thick black beard and\nmustache. The man laughed at him.\n\n\"Would you turn away? Have you no stomach for Erculio's holy work?\"\n\nDaoud fixed the man with a stare, thinking of what he would like to do\nto him. He realized, though, that if he tried to fight his way out of\nthe piazza, the little man on the scaffold would certainly notice him.\nIf he simply stayed where he was and watched, his would be one face in\nthousands, and the dwarf obviously had more pressing business. He\nreached up to the soft cap on his head, making sure it covered most of\nhis blond hair. Without a word to the man in brown, who had shrunk from\nhis stare, Daoud turned and faced the platform. He was just in time to\nsee the bent dwarf--Erculio, was that his name?--bless himself, just as\nhe had at Lucera.\n\nDaoud's heart pounded as he imagined himself and Lorenzo and Ugolini\nsuffering as this naked, bleeding blistered heretic was.\n\n_And Sophia! God forbid! I would cut her throat myself before I let\nanything like this happen to her._\n\nThe thought of Sophia being tortured in public was such agony that he\nwanted to scream and fight his way out of the piazza. He did Sufi\nbreathing exercises to calm himself.\n\nThey had tied the moaning victim down on a wooden sawhorse. Lying on his\nback, he was low enough that the bent man could easily reach any part of\nhim. One of the executioners in red held the victim's mouth open, and\nthe little man reached in with one hand, pulled forth the tongue and\nsliced it off. Like a jongleur producing an apple from his sleeve, he\nwaved the severed tongue at the crowd, then threw it. A forest of hands\nclutched at it. Common people everywhere, Daoud recalled, believed that\nparts of the bodies of condemned men could be used in magic.\n\nIt took a moment for Erculio to saw the heretic's nose off. With tongue\nand nose gone, the condemned man's screams no longer sounded human. They\nwere like the bellowings of a steer being clumsily slaughtered.\n\nDaoud realized that he was grateful for the problem that the little man\npresented. It gave him something urgent to think about other than what\nhe was watching.\n\nErculio now stuck the knife, point down, in the platform and used both\nhands to tear the heretic's eyeballs out. The tormented man was silent\nnow. He must have fainted. The little man danced about him, jabbing him\nrepeatedly with the knife until the screams started again.\n\nWere the nobles and churchmen enjoying this as much as the common folk,\nDaoud wondered. There seemed to be fewer prelates in red and purple on\nthe church and steps when he looked. Ugolini stood with his hands behind\nhis back, turning his eyes away from the scene in the piazza. De\nVerceuil stared right at the victim, his little mouth open in a grin\nshowing white teeth. D'Ucello stood stolidly between his guards, his\narms folded. He did not seem to have moved or changed the expression on\nhis face since Daoud first saw him.\n\nSimon de Gobignon was pale as parchment, and even as Daoud watched, the\nyoung man turned and hurried into the cathedral.\n\n_Weakling! It is because of you, too, that this man suffers, but you\ncannot face it._\n\nErculio, dancing, grimacing comically under his black mustache, feinted\nrepeatedly with his knife at the condemned man's groin. When the shouts\nof the crowd had reached a crescendo, he fell upon his victim and sliced\naway testicles and penis with quick strokes. The heretic gave a long,\nshivering howl of agony, then was silent. The little man tossed the\nbloody organs into the air. An executioner in red caught them and threw\nthem to the other one, who in turn hurled them into the crowd.\n\n_I hope dozens of them are killed in the scramble. God forgive me for\nthe pain I have caused this man._\n\nThe two men in red untied the condemned man and heaved him to his feet,\nhis face and body so running with blood that he, too, seemed dressed in\nred. The crowd began to back away from the scaffold, and Daoud felt\nhimself irresistibly carried back with them. The executioners tied the\nlimp form of the heretic to the stake jutting up from the center of the\nplatform.\n\nThe black-clad dwarf scuttled like a monkey to the edge of the platform,\nand someone handed him a flaming torch. He danced with it. He whirled it\nin great circles around his head, and Daoud heard it hissing even over\nthe cheers of the crowd. He swung the flame between his legs and leapt\nover it. He threw it high in the air, the torch spinning under the thick\ngray clouds that hung low over Orvieto. Erculio neatly caught it when it\ncame down. For a man so badly deformed, his agility was eerie.\n\nErculio turned toward the cathedral, holding up the torch. Daoud\nfollowed the dwarf's gaze and saw d'Ucello, the podesta, his face a\nwhite mask, give a wave of assent.\n\nSpinning on his heels, the dwarf scurried to the ladder, scrambled down\na few rungs, and threw the torch into the tinder piled under the\nplatform. Then he turned and leapt out into space. The other two\nexecutioners had left the platform and stood at the bottom of the\nladder, and one of them caught Erculio and swung him down.\n\nThe flames shot up with a roar, a red and gold curtain around the\nheretic. Daoud heard no more cries of pain. Perhaps he was already dead\nof his wounds. Daoud prayed to God that it be so.\n\nThe smoke did not rise in the hot, moist air, but coiled and spread\naround the scaffold. People coughed and wiped their eyes and drew back\nfarther from the blaze. Daoud was close enough to feel the heat, and on\nsuch a sweltering day it was unbearable. But now, he discovered, he\ncould move. The crowd was dispersing. There was nothing more to see. The\nheretic was surely dead, and the smoke and flames hid the destruction of\nhis body.\n\nDaoud looked up at the cathedral steps. There were no red or purple\nrobes there, and the papal banner was gone. The Count de Gobignon had\nreappeared and was staring at the fire. As Daoud watched, the count\nstumbled down the steps, his arms hanging loosely at his sides.\n\nDaoud turned to go back to Ugolini's.\n\n\"Well, Messer David, do they do as thorough a job on heretics in\nTrebizond?\"\n\nDaoud's path was blocked by a man in a scarlet robe. From beneath the\nwide circular brim of a great red hat, the long, dark face of Cardinal\nde Verceuil glowered at him. Thick red tassels hung down from the hat\nall around the cardinal's head.\n\nImmediately behind de Verceuil stood two attendants. One held high a\nwhite banner blazoned with a red cross and a gold flower shape in two of\nthe quarters; the other man, a sturdy, shaven-headed young cleric in\nblack cassock, carried a long golden rod that curved into a tight spiral\nat the top. That was called a crosier, Daoud recalled, and was the\ncardinal's staff of office. Behind them were four men-at-arms who looked\nhard at Daoud, as if expecting him to give offense to their master.\nDaoud wondered if the cardinal would consider having him killed here in\npublic. Daoud stared at him through the smoky air, measuring him,\nlooking for those small signs of tension to be found in a man about to\norder an attack. The man seemed too relaxed for that.\n\n\"No, Your Eminence, we only stone our heretics to death.\"\n\nDe Verceuil smiled. \"That may be a better way of disposing of them.\nAfter a burning, the unpleasant thought always occurs to me that I am\ncarrying the heretic away in my nostrils and lungs.\"\n\nSickened inwardly at this reminder of the rancid smell that had come\nfrom the heretic's pyre, Daoud smiled at the grisly jest, as he assumed\nthe cardinal expected him to. He remained silent, waiting for de\nVerceuil to reveal the reason for this encounter.\n\n\"Ordinarily we merely burn heretics,\" the cardinal went on. \"We had this\nman tormented first because he threatened our guests, the Tartar\nambassadors, and disturbed a service in the cathedral with the pope\nhimself present. We had to be severe with him.\"\n\n\"Assuredly,\" said Daoud, still smiling. De Verceuil's Italian sounded\nstrange to him. He must be speaking it with a French accent.\n\n\"But perhaps, since you seem to think the Tartars are such a danger to\nChristendom,\" said de Verceuil in a voice that was lower and more\nmenacing, \"you approve of what that man did.\" He gestured toward the\nburning scaffold. The stake and whatever was left of the body bound to\nit had fallen through the platform into the pile of faggots. A breeze\nhad sprung up and was blowing the smoke away from Daoud and the\ncardinal, for which Daoud thanked God.\n\n\"I came here today to see justice done,\" Daoud said firmly.\n\n\"You profess the Greek Church,\" said de Verceuil, eyeing him coldly.\n\"That makes you a heretic yourself.\"\n\nThe men-at-arms behind the cardinal shifted restlessly, and Daoud\nwondered again if de Verceuil meant to provoke a fight leading to a\nkilling. Or perhaps have him arrested. He looked past de Verceuil and\nhis men and saw that some curious citizens had formed a circle around\nhimself and the cardinal. And there was de Gobignon, standing watchfully\nonly a short distance away at the foot of the cathedral steps. Was his\nsword, too, at the cardinal's command?\n\n\"If you are concerned about justice, it is too bad you chose to be\nCardinal Ugolini's guest during your stay in Orvieto,\" de Verceuil said.\n\"You will hear only a corrupt Italian point of view in his household.\"\n\nPraise God, de Verceuil was not pursuing the matter of Daoud's heresy.\n\nDaoud shrugged. \"I have seen what devastation the Tartars do, Your\nEminence. With respect, let me say to you that they are as much a danger\nto your country, France, as to Italy.\"\n\nDe Verceuil essayed what he may have thought was an ingratiating smile,\nbut his small mouth made him look sly and sour.\n\n\"I invite you to come to live at the Palazzo Monaldeschi. I have spoken\nto the contessa, and she would be most happy to receive you. The\nMonaldeschi are the wealthiest family in Orvieto, and they have\nconnections with other great families in the Papal States. If you wish\nto find good customers for your silks and spices here, it is the\ncontessa you should see. And if you would trade with France, perhaps I\ncan help you there.\"\n\nThe possibility of spending some days and nights in enemy headquarters\nwas intriguing. But would it be prudent to put himself into de\nVerceuil's and de Gobignon's hands?\n\nDaoud shook his head with what he hoped was a regretful smile. \"Forgive\nme, Your Eminence. Your offer of the contessa's hospitality overwhelms\nme, but I have already promised to remain with Cardinal Ugolini, and he\nwould be deeply offended if I were to leave him.\"\n\nDe Verceuil glowered. \"Ugolini is from Hohenstaufen territory. The\nMonaldeschi have always been loyal to the pope and have great influence\nwith him. Just as I have with King Louis of France and his brother,\nCount Charles. Come to us, and when you go back to your own land you\nwill be a wealthy man.\"\n\n\"Could it be that Your Eminence hopes I might change my testimony about\nthe Tartars?\"\n\nDaoud felt close to laughter as the cardinal's cheeks reddened.\n\nDe Verceuil shot back, \"Could it be that your enmity to the Tartars is\nmore important to you than your profit as a merchant?\"\n\nDaoud's heart beat harder. That was too close to the mark. It was\nfoolish of him to jest with a man who had the power to condemn him and\nhis friends to be tortured and burned like that poor madman.\n\n\"I regret that I have offended Your Eminence,\" he said. \"I have seen\nwhat I have seen, and I am honor bound to speak the truth. And profit\nwill do me no good if the Tartars slaughter us all.\"\n\n\"You are ignorant of our ways,\" de Verceuil said ominously, after a long\npause during which Daoud felt raindrops strike his face. \"Have a care\nthat you do not slip into pitfalls you cannot possibly foresee.\"\n\nFirst de Verceuil joked, then he threatened, then he offered\nhospitality, then he threatened again. He seemed to have no sense of how\nto deal with men.\n\n_Even if we were on the same side, I would hate him. What a trial he\nmust be for his allies._\n\nBut Daoud was eager to get away without creating any deeper enmity\nbetween himself and the cardinal. \"I thank you again for your offer of\nhospitality, Your Eminence. Even if I cannot come to live at the\nMonaldeschi palace, I do hope to meet the contessa. She has graciously\ninvited Cardinal Ugolini to her reception for the Tartar ambassadors,\nand I shall accompany him.\"\n\n\"Do not think you are free to do as you please in Orvieto,\" said de\nVerceuil angrily. \"You are being closely watched.\" He turned abruptly\nand strode off. Daoud bowed politely to his scarlet back. Casting ugly\nlooks at Daoud, the cardinal's men followed.\n\nDaoud told himself that it would be wise to be frightened. But what he\nfelt was more a profound disdain for Paulus de Verceuil.\n\n_As a man of religion or of power, how can this squawking bird in red\nplumage compare with Sheikh Saadi and the Imam Fayum of the\nHashishiyya?_\n\nThe rain was coming down harder. It hissed in the still-burning heap of\nwood and bones.\n\nA movement near the cathedral steps caught Daoud's eye. He turned and\nsaw Simon de Gobignon looking at him. Why was he alone? Had he, like\nDaoud, not wanted any of his comrades to see this horror?\n\nHow infuriating it must be for that proud young Frank to have to work\nclosely with a man like Cardinal de Verceuil. The cardinal was so\narrogant, so overbearing, so crude as to turn people _against_ any cause\nhe might support, no matter how worthy.\n\nAs the rain fell on him, Daoud hardly noticed it. He saw a new plan\nshimmering like a mirage on the horizon of his mind.\n\n\n\n\nXXI\n\n\n\"Bonsoir, Messire. I have not seen you since the day the heretic was\nburned. I trust the spectacle did not disturb you?\"\n\nSimon had deliberately addressed David of Trebizond in French, to find\nout whether the trader spoke that language in addition to Greek and\nItalian. He might be from the other side of the earth, but there was\nsomething very French-looking about him.\n\nThey stood facing each other a little apart from the crowd gathered in\nthe sala maggiore, the great hall of the Palazzo Monaldeschi. The large\nroom was lit by hundreds of candles. Four musicians in a distant corner\nsawed away energetically at vielles of different sizes held between\ntheir knees, while two others blew on hautboys. Tables were piled high\nwith meat and pastry along the sides of the hall. Servants circulated,\nrefilling goblets from pitchers of wine. Neither Simon nor David was\nholding a goblet.\n\nThe big blond man, who had not been looking at Simon, turned and stared\nat him. Simon detected a pallor under his tan. David did not react to\nthe sound of French like a man who had heard an unfamiliar language. He\nlooked more as if he had heard the voice of a ghost.\n\nDavid bowed. \"Pardonnez-moi, Monseigneur. I had not expected to be\naddressed in French.\"\n\nSimon was surprised to hear in David's northern French the harsh accents\nof the English Channel coast.\n\n\"Where did you learn my tongue, Messire?\" Simon asked.\n\nDavid shrugged. \"Since the Crusades began, many of your countrymen have\npassed through Trebizond.\"\n\nMany Crusaders had been Normans, Simon thought. It made sense. But it\nwas odd that this man David, who claimed to be a Greek, not only spoke\nlike a Norman, but looked like nothing so much as a big, blond Norman\nknight. Simon had seen just such faces--square, with long, straight\nnoses and cold gray-blue eyes--everywhere in Normandy and in England\nwhen he had accompanied King Louis on a state visit to the realm of his\nvassal, King Henry of England.\n\nBut David did not dress like a Norman, Simon noted. His apparel was\ngaudy in the extreme. He wore a white cap with a blood-red feather, a\nshort cloth-of-gold cape, particolored hose--light green and peach--and\nforest-green boots.\n\nSimon, who, in emulation of King Louis preferred somber colors, had\nchosen for tonight a brown velvet singlet and maroon hose. The brightest\nthing about him was the jeweled handle of his prized scimitar.\n\n\"I hope that you were not upset by the bloody execution of that heretic\nlast week,\" Simon said once again.\n\n\"Oh, no.\" David smiled. \"But I saw you there, and you seemed to be.\"\n\n_God's wounds, how true that is!_ was Simon's first thought. He had held\nhimself rigid throughout the heretic's horrible death, afraid that he\nwould throw up.\n\nBut how disturbing to discover that this Greek merchant, apparently an\nenemy, had seen right through Simon's effort to appear imperturbable. Of\nall the people in Orvieto, this man was the last Simon would want to\nreveal himself to. He cursed himself for giving David such a perfect\nopening.\n\n_How could I be such a fool? And I thought I was so clever, addressing\nhim in French._\n\nSimon had been anticipating his next encounter with David with a mixture\nof eagerness, fear, and anger, almost as if it were to be a battle. Now\nhe wished he had stayed away from the man.\n\n\"I felt sorry for the poor devil, as I believe a Christian should,\"\nSimon said. \"Did you not?\"\n\nThere was a baleful look in David's eyes, as if he hated Simon for his\nanswer.\n\nBut the man from Trebizond only shrugged and said, \"I have seen much\nblood and pain in my life.\"\n\nA broad figure in a white robe billowed up to Simon and David. Simon\nremembered him from the pope's council--Fra Tomasso d'Aquino, the\ndistinguished Dominican. The friar's belt of rosary beads rattled as he\nwalked. It would take a week, Simon thought, to recite all the Our\nFathers and Hail Marys that encircled Fra Tomasso.\n\n\"Count, I trust you will forgive my interrupting you. I have already had\nthe pleasure of meeting Messer David of Trebizond, but I have wanted to\nspeak to you ever since you arrived in Orvieto. As a seminarian I\nstudied for a year in Paris under your uncle, Hugues de Gobignon. A\nfriar of great renown. His murder was such a tragedy.\"\n\nSimon felt uneasy at reminiscence about the uncle who was not really his\nuncle. As he chatted with Fra Tomasso, his eyes roved through the large\nroom. He noticed the crowd gathered around the Tartars, John and Philip,\nwho were seated in large, comfortable-looking chairs placed near a\ncrowned swan at the center of a serving table. He saw a servant pour\nwine into a silver cup John held out to him. More of that wonderful wine\nof Montefiascone?\n\nBeside the Tartars stood a woman named Ana from the land of the Bulgars,\nterritory now ruled by the Tartars. Anything, thought Simon bitterly, to\nkeep Friar Mathieu from achieving too much importance. De Verceuil had\nfound her and had taken her along as interpreter when the Tartars had\ntheir first private audience with the pope.\n\nAnother group stood around the seated Pope Urban, many of them in the\nred and purple of cardinals, archbishops, and bishops. There was de\nVerceuil, of course, as near to the pope as he could get. The cardinal's\nvanity, as usual, had made him choose layman's garb, a tunic of\ngold-braided silk and a cape of aquamarine satin trimmed with red-dyed\nsquirrel fur. And between two prelates' shoulders Simon could just make\nout the top of Cardinal Ugolini's fuzzy gray head.\n\nIf Ugolini was here, had his niece Sophia come tonight as well? Yes,\nthere she was, halfway across the hall, talking to the Contessa di\nMonaldeschi. The pale violet of Sophia's gown made her skin look darker.\nThe poets always sang of _fair_ ladies, but Simon found her dark\ncomplexion wondrously attractive. She had let her embroidered silk shawl\nfall away from her bare shoulders, and he marveled at their sweet\ndelicacy. Under her gauze veil the pearls in her headdress twinkled like\nstars against hair that was black as night.\n\n\"Excuse me, Fra Tomasso, Messer David. I have promised to deliver a most\nurgent message to the contessa.\"\n\nFra Tomasso, in the middle of an anecdote about Friar Hugues's subtlety\nas an inquisitor, gave Simon leave to go. As David bowed, his eyes met\nSimon's, and his look was at once both knowing and bitter. He, too, was\na guest in Ugolini's house, thought Simon. Was he, too, attracted to\nSophia? Who would not be?\n\nAs Simon moved toward Sophia, the contessa's majordomo strode to the\ncenter of the sala maggiore and called in a deep voice, \"Signori e\nmadonne, tables, game boards, and cards are set for your amusement in\nthe inner galleria.\"\n\nThen Simon was bowing before the contessa, acutely aware of Sophia\nstanding beside her. He kissed the old lady's shiny knuckles, hoping he\nwould have an opportunity to kiss Sophia's hand as well.\n\n\"My dear boy, did you hear the announcement? Do you enjoy cards or\nbackgammon? I understand your pious king forbids such amusements at his\ncourt. And yet our Holy Father himself loves to play alii.\" She saw\nSimon staring at Sophia and smiled.\n\n\"You see, my dear?\" the contessa said to Sophia. \"Does this splendid\nyoung Frenchman look as if he is interested in cards or dice? Or in you?\nEnough of your modesty.\"\n\nSophia lowered her eyelids and blushed. How beautiful her olive\ncomplexion was, tinted with rose!\n\n\"The contessa is merciless,\" she said in a low voice.\n\n\"Merciless!\" the contessa cackled. \"My dear, if I were the envious sort,\nthen indeed would I show you no mercy. By San Giorgio, I would have you\npoisoned. But I made up my mind many, many years ago, when I saw my\nlooks beginning to fade, that I had to choose between hating the beauty\nof other women or enjoying it. I was already spending all my hatred on\nthe odious Filippeschi. So I decided that when I saw beautiful women I\nwould rejoice at their presence in the world and delight myself by\nremembering my own youth and imagining the pleasures they must be\nexperiencing.\"\n\nShe put her hand on Simon's arm. \"What do you think, Count Simon? Would\nyou like me to present this young lady to you?\"\n\n\"A thousand thanks, Contessa,\" said Simon, falling into the extravagant\nstyle of speaking the occasion seemed to call for. \"I have already had\nthe great pleasure of meeting Madonna Sophia at her uncle's mansion.\"\n\nThe contessa nodded. \"Ah, you have called upon Cardinal Ugolini. I am\nglad to hear that. I would have told you to if you had not done it on\nyour own.\" She turned again to Sophia. \"Your uncle and I have been\nfriends ever since the Holy Father moved the papal household to Orvieto.\nI deeply admire and respect him. When he reads the stars for me, his\ninsights and predictions are remarkably accurate. His remedies for my\nbody's complaints always achieve their purpose, which is more than I can\nsay for other physicians I have consulted. And best of all, he finds\ntime for a lonely old lady, when others who should be more attentive\nmake excuses.\"\n\n\"My uncle is a marvelous man, Your Signory,\" Sophia murmured. \"I am most\nfortunate to be his niece. Otherwise I could never hope to be present on\nthis magnificent occasion, to meet and talk with you.\"\n\n\"And to be waited upon by this handsome cavaliere,\" the contessa\nfinished for her, smiling broadly.\n\n_The contessa really is enjoying this_, Simon thought. The old lady was\nbeaming with pleasure.\n\nSophia turned to Simon.\n\n\"I am most pleased to see you again, Count.\" Her eyes seemed to shine at\nhim. Was it his imagination?\n\nShe held out her hand. His whole body felt more intensely alive as his\nfingers touched hers. He noticed as he bent over her hand that she wore\none ring, a garnet of a red so deep as to be almost black. His lips\ntouched the creamy skin of the back of her hand, and he thought he felt\nher tremble slightly.\n\nContessa Elvira eyed both of them, sighed happily, and said, \"I think it\nis time for me to find someone to play rota with. Perhaps I will ask\nyour uncle to tell my fortune with the cards. He reads the cards as well\nas he reads the stars.\"\n\nThey bowed as she moved off. As she turned her back, Simon noticed that\nher long blue velvet gown had threadbare patches in the rear. She was so\nold and so powerful, Simon thought, that such things did not matter to\nher. Perhaps it was a favorite gown from the days when she was young and\nbeautiful, like Sophia.\n\nBut he doubted that she had ever been as beautiful as Sophia.\n\n\"May I bring you some wine or something to eat, Madonna?\" he asked\nSophia.\n\n\"Thank you, I am not hungry. But\"--she gestured as if to free him from\nobligation to stand with her--\"perhaps you--\"\n\n\"Oh, no, I am quite content. A hand of cards, then?\" Simon hoped she\nwould see that he was making it his responsibility to entertain her.\n\nShe took a deep breath, and Simon felt a small thrill as he watched her\nbosom rise and fall under the fine silk of her violet gown. \"What I\nwould really like, Count, would be a stroll in the garden. This room,\nbig as it is, is so hot and crowded. And even though it is September,\nthis evening it is very warm, do you not think so?\"\n\n\"Very warm,\" said Simon, delightedly taking her arm.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs Fra Tomasso chatted with him, Daoud watched de Gobignon and Sophia\nstroll across the brightly candlelit hall to the door leading to the\ninner galleria.\n\n_De Gobignon spoke to me in the language of my parents._\n\nSire Geoffrey and Dame Evelyn Langmuir, he knew, were of English stock.\nBut Daoud's father had once told him that all the English nobility spoke\nFrench.\n\nTonight was the first time since Daoud landed in Italy that he had heard\nFrench or had spoken it. When he first heard himself addressed in\nFrench, he had experienced a strange and frightening sensation, as if\nhis dead father were speaking to him. He hated de Gobignon for doing\nthat to him.\n\n_And I hate him because he will enjoy the woman I want for myself._\n\nThe voice of Fra Tomasso faded away. Black rage filled Daoud's skull,\ndeafening and blinding him. He pictured Sophia naked in Simon de\nGobignon's arms, and his body trembled.\n\nAnd when he did become Sophia's lover, the puppy would have no\nunderstanding of how much of a woman he was possessing. To him she would\nbe the sweet Sicilian niece of a cardinal. He would have no idea of the\nwoman behind that mask.\n\nSophia, Daoud had come to realize, had known suffering and loss. She had\nsurvived at the very bottom of the world, and she had risen to be the\nintimate of an emperor and a king.\n\nShe occupied his thoughts, Daoud sensed with some uneasiness, far more\noften than did Blossoming Reed back in El Kahira.\n\nSimon would know Sophia Orfali, not Sophia Karaiannides, who had told\nDaoud more than once, he thought with a grim smile, how much she hated\nFranks. She would make a fool of this Frank.\n\nFra Tomasso was rambling on about the one sea voyage he had ever taken,\nfrom Normandy to Naples. \"One would think going around the continent of\nEurope like that would take much longer than making the same journey\noverland. It took us only a month, whereas on land it would have taken\nat least three. The sea is a two-dimensional surface. On land one is\ntraveling over a three-dimensional surface and can encounter many\nobstacles.\"\n\n_Yes, and a carrier pigeon travels much faster than a ship._ In a month\nor two Daoud's request for the book Fra Tomasso wanted would have\nreached Baibars, and a few months after that, if Baibars could obtain\nthe book, the Friar's pudgy hands would be holding it.\n\nListening with half an ear, Daoud looked about him at the marble pillars\nthat ran up to the gilded beams of the ceiling, at the paintings of\nangels and saints on the plaster walls, at the fragments of old Roman\nstatues that stood here and there--mostly nude torsos. Idolatry, yes,\nbut beautifully done. The arts of the Christians and their pagan\npredecessors were not altogether as barbaric as he had imagined them.\n\nUgolini suddenly appeared at Daoud's elbow to interrupt his thoughts and\nFra Tomasso's discourse. \"Excuse me, Fra Tomasso, but His Holiness\nwishes a word with David.\"\n\nThe little cardinal's eyes darted about nervously. Obviously, the idea\nof a conversation between Daoud and the pope terrified him.\n\n\"Have you had any wine?\" said Ugolini in a low voice as they crossed the\nroom to where Urban, in his white cassock, a red cloak wrapped around\nhis shoulders, was sitting in a large, high-backed chair. The spiritual\nfather of all Christians was dressed heavily for such a warm evening,\nDaoud thought. A sign of ill health.\n\n\"I never drink wine if I can avoid it,\" he answered Ugolini.\n\n\"Well, you will not be able to avoid it tonight. But remember, you have\nno head for it.\"\n\nDaoud was about to retort sharply, but he swallowed the impulse. Such\nunnecessary advice was the cardinal's way of allaying his terror. He had\nnever told Ugolini about the training in resistance to drugs he had\nundergone with Sheikh Saadi. Al-koahl, the intoxicating element in wine,\ncould affect his body but not his mind.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"This is a very dangerous practice,\" Sheikh Saadi said as he crouched\nover a small cooking pot suspended on a tripod above a low fire. \"But it\nis now a necessary one for you.\"\n\nWhatever was bubbling in the pot gave off a strange, cloying odor that\nDaoud found frightening and seductive at the same time. They were in the\ninner garden of Saadi's small house in al-Fustat, the oldest quarter of\nEl Kahira.\n\nDaoud half sat, half reclined on a pile of cushions. He leaned back and\nsaw that the stars were fewer and the sky was lighter. They had been up\nall night drinking kaviyeh.\n\nThe liquid Saadi was brewing now smelled nothing like kaviyeh. Studying\nthe simmering, sweet-smelling liquid, Saadi seemed satisfied. He took\nthe pot off the fire and set it on a stone.\n\nStill on his knees, the sheikh swung around to smile at Daoud. In the\nfirelight his face was many shades of brown and black. But his beard, in\nthe years Daoud had known him, had gone from gray to a white as pure as\nthe wool from which the Sufi took their name.\n\n\"Kneel and compose your mind,\" said Saadi.\n\nDaoud rose from a sitting position to his knees. As Saadi had taught\nhim, and as he had practiced for many years, he visualized his mind as\nan empty pool, walled with tiles. A fountain sprang up in the center of\nthe pool and filled it slowly with clear water. The walls of the pool\ndisappeared, and there was nothing but clear water in all directions,\nstretching away to infinity.\n\nSaadi seemed to know when Daoud had reached the vision of infinity, and\nhe spoke again.\n\n\"Think of God.\"\n\nDaoud saw a mountain, a flame, the sun. None of those were God. At last\nhe saw the blackness of the spaces between the stars. There in the\ninfinite lightlessness was the dwelling place of God, like the Black\nStone in the Qa'aba. He saw the darkness that veiled God, and he locked\nthe idea of God in his mind.\n\n\"Now, hold the thought of God, and drink.\"\n\nSaadi held a silver cup to his lips. The liquid was sweet and thick. He\nswallowed, and it burned the lining of his stomach.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Wine mixed with hashish.\"\n\nDaoud was shocked.\n\n_Filth, spiritual poison!_\n\nSaadi himself had taught him that. And now Saadi had tricked him into\nsipping the vile stuff.\n\nHe swayed on his knees, feeling dizzy and angry. Saadi held up a warning\nhand.\n\n\"Remain in the Presence of God. He will protect you from the ill effects\nof the poison. This is the practice.\"\n\nDaoud struggled back to the infinite emptiness that hid God, and as he\ndid so he felt his mind clear. The drugs were spreading like tiny flames\nthrough his body, but his body was far away. Too far away for him to\nfeel the heat.\n\nBeside him, Saadi said, \"Everything made by God has two sides, a useful\nside and a harmful side. That which is sometimes a poison can at other\ntimes be a medicine. Even kaviyeh, which we drink in such great\nquantities to give vigor to our minds, can be a poison. If a substance\nis taken in the right amount, on the right occasion, with the right\nattitude, it can unlock doors in the mind. Our lord Baibars, peace be\nupon him, has told me he plans to send you to the Hashishiyya for\nfurther training. This practice will help you to gain more from their\nteachings--and protect you from being corrupted by them. In the months\nto come you will learn to take in every kind of intoxicating substance\nand keep your mind free. This is not magic. This is a power of the\nspirit. What are you feeling?\"\n\n\"The drug devours my body, but my mind is in the Presence of God.\"\n\n\"One day, when you have learned all you can from the Hashishiyya, I will\nteach you the secret of the most powerful drug of all--soma, the drug\nthat is made by the mind and does not harm the body at all.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_No head for wine? No man in this room is less susceptible to wine._\n\nDe Verceuil still stood beside the white-bearded pope. His gloomy face\ntightened as his eyes met Daoud's.\n\nDaoud dropped to one knee before the pope and kissed the heavy gold ring\nthat bore a tiny engraving of a man in a boat. He saw that the old man\nwas wearing white satin slippers.\n\nDaoud felt so dizzied by the wonder of this moment that the tiled floor\nseemed to shake under him. He held in his hand the hand of the Pope of\nRome, successor to those popes who had sent wave after wave of crusaders\ncrashing against the walls of Islam, whose words had caused the deaths\nof thousands and thousands of the faithful. He, Daoud ibn Abdallah, once\nDavid Langmuir, had penetrated to the very center of Christian power.\n\n_Was there ever a moment like this before in all of time, when a servant\nof the true God and a believer in the word of the Prophet held the hand\nof a pope in his?_\n\n\"Messer David of Trebizond, the Venetians have just raised the prices of\nsaffron, curry, ginger, and cardamom,\" said the pontiff in a deep voice.\n\"All of which are indispensable to my kitchen. Can you furnish me with\nspices more cheaply?\"\n\nIt took all of Daoud's self-control to hold in a burst of laughter. A\nMameluke comes face-to-face with the pope, and what do they discuss? The\nprice of spices!\n\nBut he sobered as he realized how useful the pope's interest in spices\ncould be to him. As a purveyor of spices to the papal palace, his\nposition in Orvieto would be more respected and more secure.\n\n\"If you deal with us, Holy Father, you are dealing with the people from\nwhom the Venetians get those spices,\" said Daoud with a smile as he\nstood up. \"This is exactly the purpose of my visit.\"\n\n\"Good, good. Have Cardinal Ugolini arrange an appointment for you with\nmy steward.\"\n\nAs they walked away, Daoud said softly to Ugolini, \"Would it not be\namusing if the Sultan of Cairo were to furnish the spices for the pope's\nkitchen?\" The irony of it once again struck him as funny. What a tale\nfor the bazaars of El Kahira.\n\nUgolini stared at him, side whiskers quivering. \"Not amusing at all.\"\n\n_Ugolini is right to be afraid. I saw what they did to that man in the\npiazza. I must not make jokes. Ugolini needs to feel he can rely on me._\n\nCelino emerged from the circle around the Tartars to stand before Daoud.\nAt Daoud's insistence the Sicilian wore garments tailored specially for\nthis evening, mostly in white, with gold embroidery on the edges of his\nwaist-length ermine-trimmed cape and his satin tunic.\n\n\"What are the Tartars doing?\" Daoud asked.\n\n\"Sitting and drinking and mostly talking to each other,\" said Celino.\n\"There is a crowd of curious people around them, asking them questions.\"\n\n\"Where is that Friar Mathieu who interprets for them?\"\n\nCelino shrugged. \"Not here. There is a woman from some eastern country\ntranslating.\"\n\nDaoud felt a tingle of excitement, like a hunter who had sighted prey.\n\nHe surveyed the room. Simon de Gobignon--_may his right hand rot and\nwither_--had already left with Sophia, as Daoud and Sophia had planned.\nDe Verceuil still hovered near the pope.\n\n\"Celino, you heard the contessa's servant announcing games in the next\nroom? See if you can draw Cardinal de Verceuil into a game with you.\"\n\n\"He favors backgammon,\" said Ugolini.\n\n\"All the French dote on backgammon,\" said Celino.\n\n\"Keep him entertained,\" said Daoud.\n\n\"To entertain de Verceuil you will have to bore yourself,\" said Ugolini.\n\"He prefers a game whose outcome is never in doubt.\"\n\nDaoud and Ugolini turned to the serving table, and Daoud began\nmethodically to work his way through the various dishes the contessa's\nservants had set out for her guests. There were eels steeped in a\nstrange, almost rotten-smelling sauce, there were small, tender lobsters\nand large, meaty ones. There were baby birds meant to be eaten bones and\nall. There was white bread and there were fine cakes. Daoud filled his\nstomach, forcing himself to eat even those foods that repelled him,\nwhile he watched Celino join the group gathered with the pope.\n\nDaoud used his dagger to cut himself a slice of roast veal. It was juicy\nand tender, and he cut himself another. The meat tasted as if the calf\nhad been killed that same day; it was not heavily spiced. How pleasant\nto dine at the home of a wealthy woman. By the time he finished his\nfourth slice, Celino and de Verceuil were in conversation.\n\nDaoud chatted with Ugolini about astrology. In the cardinal's opinion it\nwas an auspicious night, and that assessment of the heavens helped calm\nthe bewhiskered little man somewhat.\n\nIt being harvest season, the contessa's tables were laden with fresh\nfruits. Daoud enjoyed apricots and grapes, and sliced open an orange. He\nwatched Celino and de Verceuil move toward the galleria, where the\ncontessa's guests were playing games.\n\nDaoud eyed the two brown-skinned men in their shimmering robes sitting\nat their ease in the sala maggiore in the midst of a circle of curious\npeople. Their chief guardians, de Verceuil, de Gobignon, and Friar\nMathieu, were all elsewhere.\n\nDaoud, as was customary among these people, dipped his hands in a basin\nof water and wiped them on the table linen. Then he began to push his\nway into the ring of people around the Tartars.\n\nAfter a few moments he found himself staring down at them. They were\nlaughing together over some private joke, speaking to each other in\ntheir chirping language.\n\nFra Tomasso was part of the group around the Tartars, as were several\nbishops and two cardinals. A stout, middle-aged woman stood beside John,\nthe older of the two. She wore a stiff, brocaded blue gown, and her hair\nwas tightly wrapped in a net of gold thread.\n\n\"Madonna Ana,\" said Fra Tomasso, \"ask Messer John Chagan for me whether\nthe city called Karakorum is still the capital of the Tartar empire.\"\n\nThe woman turned to the white-bearded John and repeated the question in\nrapid-flowing Tartar speech.\n\nJohn bowed and smiled to Fra Tomasso and spoke to the woman. Daoud\nalmost felt envy at the sight of John's gorgeous ankle-length silk\nrobe--white, printed with flowers having massive, many-petaled crimson\nand purple heads, along with clusters of green leaves and wispy gold\nclouds. He gestured as he spoke, and his hands were square,\nshort-nailed, and hard-looking. Daoud had no doubt that those hands had\ntaken many lives.\n\n\"Messer John says the capital of their empire is wherever the Great Khan\nmakes his home,\" said the Bulgarian woman in a flat tone. \"It used to be\nKarakorum. But now the Great Khan is building a city in the land of\nCathay. The city is called--Xanadu.\"\n\n\"And how long would it take to travel from Baghdad to this Xanadu?\" Fra\nTomasso asked.\n\n\"Messer John says for a party of Christians to go to Xanadu from Baghdad\nmight take as long as a year. But for the Tartar post riders it takes\ntwo months.\"\n\n\"Two months!\" exclaimed Fra Tomasso. \"For a journey that would take\nordinary men a year? How far is it?\"\n\n\"Permit me to answer that, Father,\" Daoud interrupted, \"because the\nTartars do not know your system of measurements. The roads between\nBaghdad and the great cities of Cathay are tortuous, and vast deserts\nand huge mountains stand in the way. But our geographers in Trebizond\nestimate that a caravan going over that route would travel a distance of\nthree thousand leagues.\"\n\n\"And the Tartars cover that in two months? Do they fly?\" The fat monk's\njowls quivered. Daoud noticed that the front of his white tunic was\nstained with what appeared to be spots of gravy and wine.\n\nDaoud turned to Ana. \"Kindly ask the ambassadors to explain to Fra\nTomasso how their riders cover such a distance so quickly.\"\n\nAfter some conversation between Ana and the Tartars, Fra Tomasso had his\nanswer. \"The fastest riders and horses in our empire carry messages in\nrelays over the major routes. A message never stops traveling, night and\nday, until it reaches its destination. At night, runners with torches\nguide the riders.\"\n\nThe Italians looked awed. Daoud felt unimpressed. The Mamelukes also had\npost riders. They could carry a message from El Kahira to Damascus in\nfour days.\n\n\"How intelligent!\" said Fra Tomasso. \"I will warrant we would be better\ngoverned here in Europe if we had such a system.\"\n\nThe note of admiration in Fra Tomasso's voice made Daoud uneasy. A\nservant passed, offering cups of wine on a tray. Daoud took a goblet.\nJohn and Philip raised the empty cups they held, and Ana refilled them\nfrom a pitcher on the table.\n\n\"Your empire is so vast, is it not,\" Daoud said to the Tartars through\nAna, \"that even messages that travel swiftly cannot hold it together?\"\n\nPhilip, the black-bearded Tartar, answered that, smiling. \"Fear of the\nGreat Khan holds our empire together,\" Ana translated.\n\n\"Is the Great Khan feared even in the lands of Kaidu Khan and Baraka\nKhan?\" Daoud asked, naming the two rebels who did not recognize Hulagu\nKhan's brother Kublai. He strove for a tone of innocent curiosity.\n\nThe faces of the two Tartars remained expressionless, but Daoud,\nschooled by his Hashishiyya masters to notice signs of emotion in the\nmost guarded of men, observed the flush creeping into their brown\ncheeks, the slight quickening of their breathing, and the twitching of\ntheir fingers. Until he asked his disturbing question they had answered\nDaoud readily, almost casually, as they would any of the contessa's\nother guests. Now, in silence, they studied him. Waiting for them to\nfinish their inspection, Daoud held out his wine cup to Ana, who filled\nit from the pitcher on the table. The pitcher was almost empty, and she\nsignaled to a servant to bring another.\n\nJohn Chagan said, and Ana translated, \"I do not believe we have had the\nhonor of being presented to you, Messere.\"\n\nDaoud turned to Fra Tomasso, who was following the conversation closely.\n\"Will you be good enough to introduce us, Your Reverence?\" Any\nopportunity to involve himself with the Dominican philosopher could be\nuseful.\n\nWhile Fra Tomasso presented him and Ana translated, Daoud stared at the\nTartars with deliberate challenge, draining his wine cup. Philip caught\nthe meaning of the gesture at once, and drank deep from his silver\ngoblet as well. John followed suit.\n\n\"Trebizond,\" said John. \"Not far from our borders.\" Daoud had wondered\nwhether any of the Tartars' sponsors had told them of David of Trebizond\nand his testimony against them at the pope's council.\n\n\"Your khan, Hulagu, has already pressed our emperor for tribute and\nsubmission,\" said Daoud, refilling his cup. He tensed, wondering whether\nhe was pushing the Tartars too far, too quickly. If they grew insulted\nand refused to speak to him, he would have accomplished nothing.\n\nHe sipped his wine. Before tonight, the taste of wine had always\npuckered his mouth, and he had had to force himself to drink it. But\nthis straw-colored wine was as sweet as spring water. John and Philip\nseemed to enjoy it, too. They quickly emptied and refilled their cups.\n\nDaoud watched the two Tartars closely as Ana translated his last remark.\nA suggestion of amusement played about the eyes of the white-bearded\nJohn Chagan. John, he guessed, must be about sixty years of age. Old\nenough to have ridden under the founder of the Tartar empire, the ruler\ncalled Genghis Khan. Philip, whose face was fuller, was probably half\nJohn's age.\n\n\"We are at peace with Trebizond,\" said John. \"We have exchanged\nambassadors.\" He took a gulp of wine and emitted a deeply satisfied\nsigh.\n\n\"How can a people who believe that the whole world belongs to them\nremain long at peace with anyone?\" asked Daoud. He watched the woman,\nAna. If she were to dull the edge of what he said in translating it, his\neffort would fail. But she seemed unmoved by what he said and repeated\nit quickly in the Tartar tongue.\n\nBut now the two Tartars were glaring at him, Philip in open fury, John\nwith a cold hostility as if Daoud were an insect that needed to be\nstepped on.\n\nHow much farther could he press them, he wondered as he took another sip\nof wine and stared back.\n\n\n\n\nXXII\n\n\nSophia felt cooler here, in the atrium of the Palazzo Monaldeschi, than\nshe had in the sala maggiore. A breeze blew through the archway that led\nto the rear courtyard of the palace, but it did not blow hard enough to\nkeep the mosquitoes away. Nor did the essence of lemon in the wax\ncandles in lanterns that lit the atrium repel the whining little pests,\nthough it scented the air pleasantly, mingling with the sachet of dried\norange cuttings she wore under her gown, between her breasts.\n\nTo protect herself from the insects, Sophia wrapped her shawl around her\nbare shoulders and drew her gauze veil over her face. She thought it\nmade her look more mysteriously attractive as well. Perhaps that was the\nreal reason Muslim women were willing to wear veils. She wondered\nwhether Daoud had a lover or a wife back in Cairo.\n\nProbably half a dozen of each.\n\nShe glanced over at the young French count, walking solemnly beside her\nwith his hands clasped behind his back. The mosquitoes did not seem to\nbother him, or at least he did not slap at them. Well, he was a tall,\nthin man with sharp features, dark hair, and pale skin. She imagined the\nblood of such a man might taste sour and not draw mosquitoes. He was\ngood to look at, surely, but there was a bitterness about him. She saw\nat once that he was not a happy man.\n\n\"Perhaps I should not walk alone with you like this, Madonna,\" he said.\nActually, his Italian was not difficult for her to understand; she had\ncriticized it only to throw him off balance when she first met him.\nProbably her French was no better than his Italian, but he had been too\ngallant to say so.\n\n\"Do you fear for your virtue, Your Signory?\" she asked lightly.\n\nHe smiled, and even in the dim lantern light his face took on a\nsweetness that was quite at odds with his previous solemn appearance.\n\"My virtue, such as it is, is yours to dispose, Madonna.\" She felt\nwarmed within by his words and the beauty of his smile.\n\nThey paused by a square pool in the center of the atrium. He bent and\ndipped his cupped hands, then held them out to her filled with water.\n\n\"The contessa has told me that the pool is fed by an underground\nspring,\" he said. \"The water is the purest I have ever tasted. Try it.\"\n\n\"Do the Monaldeschi keep fish in it?\" She hesitated, thinking of\nCardinal Ugolini's vivarium.\n\n\"No. This is their drinking water. Taste it.\" She lifted her veil and\nlowered her mouth into his hands. The water was pure and sweet, just as\nhe had said. As a lover, she thought, Simon would be like this\nwater--sweet, not bitter.\n\nThe water was gone and her lips touched his palm. Deliberately she\npaused a moment before drawing back.\n\nHe moved toward her, holding out both hands, but she turned as if she\nhad not noticed and took a step away from him on the gravel, dropping\nthe gauze veil before her face.\n\n\"You have not explained to me why you think you should not be walking\nalone with me, Your Signory.\"\n\n\"Ah--well--\" He had to gather his thoughts, she saw. Such a _boy_. She'd\nhad a middle-aged emperor and a splendid young king as lovers. She now\nfelt herself in love with a strange Saracen warrior, a Mameluke, who was\nsubtle, ruthless, kindly, mysterious, daring--so many things, it dizzied\nher to think about him.\n\nBut Simon's simplicity brought back memories of Alexis, the boy she had\nloved when she herself was as innocent as Simon now appeared to be.\n\nSimon said, \"Because your uncle leads the faction here in Orvieto that\nopposes the Tartars. And because the chief witness against them has been\nthe merchant David, who dwells, as you do, in the cardinal's house.\"\n\n_He hates David._ She heard it in his voice.\n\n\"What has that to do with you and me, Simon?\" This was the right moment,\nshe thought, to call him by his name. \"I care nothing for affairs of\nstate. In Siracusa we have better things to do with our time than worry\nabout alliances and wars.\"\n\n\"Everyone will be affected by what happens here concerning the Tartars,\"\nhe said. \"Even the people of Siracusa.\"\n\nShe tried to look impressed. \"If _you_ think it would be so good for\nChristians and Tartars to fight together against the Saracens, I cannot\nimagine why my uncle is against it.\"\n\n\"I do not understand that either,\" said Simon. \"Or why he brought this\nman David to Orvieto to cause so much trouble.\"\n\nShe shrugged. \"I hardly ever see the man from Trebizond. My uncle's\nmansion is so big, people can come and go without ever meeting.\" She\nhoped the suggestion would take root. It was vital for him to think\nthere was no connection between David and herself.\n\n\"This is a God-given opportunity for us to rescue the Holy Land,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"Perhaps I can help you,\" she said.\n\n\"Would you?\" His face brightened.\n\n\"I could try to find out why my uncle opposes your cause. If you will\ntell me why we Christians _should_ ally ourselves with the Tartars, I\nwill repeat your reasons to him. I will not say they came from you.\nHearing the arguments in private, coming from a loved niece, he might\nopen his mind to them.\"\n\nSimon's eyes opened wide in amazement. \"You would do all that? But why\nare you so willing to help me, Madonna, when your uncle is so opposed to\nmy cause?\"\n\n\"Because I would like\"--she hesitated just for a breath, then put her\nhand on his arm--\"I would like to see more of you.\"\n\nShe was on dangerous ground. The tradition of courtly love, in which he\nhad doubtless been reared, called for the woman to be aloof and for the\nman to beg for meetings. But Daoud had told her she did not have the\ntime to allow this inexperienced young man to proceed at his own pace.\n\nHe appeared overwhelmed with happiness. Her answer had just the effect\nshe had hoped for.\n\n\"But you must help _me_,\" she said with the satisfied feeling that she\nwas now closing the trap. \"You must teach me what to say to my uncle. As\nI said, it would be easy for you to come to me without anyone knowing.\nWill you visit me when I send for you?\"\n\n\"Oh, Madonna! Command me.\" His eyes were huge now, and his smile was\nlike a full moon shining into the atrium.\n\n\"I command you to come over here with me,\" she said.\n\nShe took him by the hand, and, as a light rain began to fall, led him\ninto a shadowy corner of the open gallery that surrounded the garden. He\npressed her back against a column. She lifted her veil and let him kiss\nher fiercely as the rain pattered down on the lemon trees.\n\nShe became entirely Sophia Orfali and tasted his kisses hungrily, dizzy\nwith joy at having won the love of a splendid young nobleman.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Of course I fought in Russia and Poland,\" Ana said, speaking for John\nChagan, while the old Tartar threw out his arms in a sweeping gesture.\n\"Everyone went.\"\n\nDaoud smiled and nodded, leaning back in the chair someone had brought\nfor him, his right leg crossed over the left. He tried to look relaxed,\nthough his heart was beating fast. He felt like a man climbing a cliff,\nwhose slightest misstep might bring a disastrous fall.\n\nHe was feeling the effects of the al-koahl--a hissing sound in his\nears, a numbness in his face, a difficulty focusing his eyes, an urge,\ndifficult to suppress, to splash the contents of his wine cup in John's\nugly face. But his mind was untouched, he knew, and that meant he was\nunder better control than these two savages whom he had drawn into\ntelling stories of their wars.\n\n\"Was that your first campaign?\" he asked.\n\nJohn made a lengthy speech in answer to Daoud's question, striking his\nchest many times and reaching for more wine. Finally Ana translated. She\nseemed made of iron, this Bulgarian woman. She did not drink, she did\nnot get tired, she did not even sit down, and she did not seem to care\nwhat anyone said.\n\nJohn assured David that as a young man he had participated in the\ndestruction of the Khwarezmian empire. Khwarezmia, Daoud remembered, a\nTurkish nation, was the first Muslim land to fall to the Tartars.\n\nHe glanced around and saw that Ugolini and a number of other cardinals,\nboth French and Italian, had gathered to listen. The contessa was there,\ntoo. And even as Daoud looked, the circle parted for Pope Urban. Two\nservants hurried over, carrying a chair for him, and he sat down\nheavily.\n\nThe Tartars had turned Khwarezmia into a desert, but this audience would\nnot care overmuch about that. Daoud wondered if he could turn the\nconversation back to what they had done in Christian lands.\n\n\"What about Moscow?\" he said. His voice sounded to him as if his ears\nwere stuffed with cotton. He worried that John might realize that he was\nbeing led to talk about what he had done against Christians.\n\n\"Moscow?\" said John. \"That was much later.\" Strange, how John's voice\nseemed to be coming from Ana's lips. \"I was in command of my own tuman\nthere, ten thousand men, under our great commander Subotai Baghadur. Ah,\nyes, we killed off all the people of Moscow.\"\n\nDaoud felt like leaping from his chair. Just what he had hoped to hear.\nHe made himself slump down still more and look sleepier.\n\n\"I never could understand how it is possible to kill off the population\nof a whole city,\" he said, affecting a tone of cool curiosity. \"It must\ntake days and be very tiring.\"\n\nPhilip Uzbek laughed when this was translated. Clearly he thought it a\nfoolish remark. His round, flat face reminded Daoud of Kassar, and with\nthe thought a red mist of rage passed before Daoud's eyes.\n\nJohn responded to Daoud's remark. \"Not at all tiring. We had five tumans\nat Moscow. There were about fifty thousand people living in the city,\nand many had died in the siege. Subotai gave the honor of the killing to\nthe most valorous tuman, which happened to be mine. We just divided them\nup. Each of us took about five of them. You can kill five people in no\ntime. It is not like fighting. Some we shot with arrows. Others we cut\ntheir heads off. The women are especially easy. You just pull their hair\nto stretch their necks so the sword will go through easier, and chop!\"\nAna, imperturbable even now, repeated the slicing gesture John made with\nhis hand.\n\n\"The children run away sometimes, and you have to chase them,\" John\nchuckled. \"It is best to use arrows on them. But the adults are so\nterrified, they just stand there.\"\n\nDaoud looked again at the circle around them. Several people looked a\nbit sick. The mouth of the elderly contessa hung open, revealing the\nabsence of two or three lower front teeth. Pope Urban leaned forward in\nhis chair, his face expressionless.\n\nDriven by his growing hatred for the Tartars, he pressed them to reveal\nmore of themselves. He should be pleased, he thought, at this much\nsuccess, but he wanted to destroy them utterly.\n\n\"You do not mind killing children?\" he asked.\n\nJohn seemed puzzled by the question. \"What else could we do with them?\nWith their parents dead they would only starve to death. Or if they\nlived, they would grow up hating us, and we would have to fight them.\"\n\n_You could make slaves of them_, said a voice inside Daoud, and the red\nmist swelled into a cloud of fury billowing up inside him. He had to sit\nmotionless, his fist clenched on the stem of his silver goblet, waiting\nfor the feeling to pass. Thank God for Saadi's teaching. It was painful\nto look directly with the inner eye at the disorientation of his senses\nand at the anger surging through his body, but it saved him from any\nfatal mistake.\n\nPhilip said, \"At Baghdad I found a whole house full of babies, maybe\nthirty or forty. I slit all of their throats. Their mothers were dead\nalready. I suppose they left the babies behind when they went out of the\ncity to be executed, hoping they would survive. But with no one to\nsuckle them, the babies would have starved to death. Killing them was an\nact of mercy.\"\n\nRemembering what he had seen of Baghdad, Daoud felt his rage grow cold\nand towering as the mountains of the Roof of the World. Those were his\nMuslim people. He wanted to draw the dagger at his belt and slash the\nthroats of the two gloating, drunken savages before him. He bit down\nhard on his lower lip to keep himself under control.\n\n\"When we shot people with arrows,\" said John, \"we went around and pulled\nthe arrows out of the bodies afterward so we could use them again. We do\nnot waste anything.\"\n\n_He is trying to show how admirable they are._\n\nDaoud watched the stout Bulgarian woman Ana speak John's words in\nItalian, still expressionless, still standing motionless. But to his\nsurprise he saw rivulets of tears on her round cheeks.\n\nShe had been in Bulgaria when the Tartars came, he thought. She had seen\nwhat Christians called \"the fury of the Tartars.\" She must have been\namong the survivors who submitted to their rule, but she had not\nforgotten. Perhaps translating John's and Philip's words exactly as they\nspoke them was her way of taking revenge.\n\nJohn held out his goblet, and Ana refilled it. He laughed softly at\nnothing in particular and drank more.\n\n\"But why do this to city after city?\" Daoud asked.\n\n\"When we invade a kingdom, the rulers and people are determined to\nresist us,\" said John. \"To fight them might cost us the lives of\nthousands of our warriors. But when we wipe out one or two whole cities,\nthey become terrified. They lose their will to fight and surrender\nquickly. It saves many lives on both sides.\"\n\nPhilip grinned broadly. \"It shows that we have power like no other\npeople on earth.\" He shook both fists. \"We can level whole cities. This\nteaches all men that Eternal Heaven has given us dominion over the whole\nearth.\"\n\nDaoud heard whispers from the people around him, and Pope Urban coughed\nsoftly.\n\nDaoud could hardly believe his luck. Not luck, he thought. God had\ndelivered the Tartars into his hands.\n\n\"The whole earth?\" said Daoud. \"Even Europe? Even the Christian lands?\"\n\nPhilip threw out his arms expansively. \"The whole earth. All there is.\nEvery corner.\"\n\nDaoud's earlier rage had subsided. Instead, he felt wild triumph, and he\nhad to grip the seat of his chair to hold himself down.\n\nDaoud heard Cardinal Ugolini declare, \"You see? Exactly what we have\nbeen saying.\"\n\n\"You say Eternal Heaven gives you the right to rule the world?\" Daoud\nasked. \"Do you mean God?\"\n\nJohn shrugged. \"Eternal Heaven is what our ancestors called Him. Now\nthat we are Christians we call Him God.\"\n\nFra Tomasso suddenly cut in. \"But surely you realize that the sky, or\nwhatever you worshiped before you became Christians, is not the true\nGod.\"\n\nAfter Ana translated this, John questioned her, squinting at the\nDominican as he did so, apparently wanting to make sure of Fra Tomasso's\nmeaning.\n\n\"Would God have neglected us before Christian priests found their way to\nour land?\" John said through Ana. \"Of course He has spoken to us. Has He\nnot made us the most powerful people on earth?\"\n\n\"Perhaps He has done so in order that you might _now_ hear His word,\"\nsaid Fra Tomasso.\n\n\"I am not a priest,\" John said with a sudden broad grin. \"But we have\nthe highest priests of the Christian faith here tonight. Let them say\nwhether Eternal Heaven and God are the same.\" He bowed his round head\nand held out his hand in invitation.\n\nA silence fell. The little band of musicians playing vielles and\nhautboys in one corner of the room suddenly sounded very loud. Daoud\nturned to look once again at the audience his dialogue with the Tartars\nhad drawn. The Contessa di Monaldeschi, Fra Tomasso, at least half a\ndozen cardinals. And Pope Urban himself. Their figures swam before\nDaoud, and he knew the wine was overcoming him--bodily, at any rate. The\nfaces of the Christian leaders looked very grave, though, and the\ngrimmer they looked, the more pleased he felt.\n\nFra Tomasso especially, he hoped, had heard enough to sway him.\n\nHe turned back to the Tartars. They, too, seemed aware of the uneasy,\nunhappy silence. The pope appeared not to feel that John's inquiry\ndeserved an answer. The older Tartar's smile faded, and he carefully set\ndown his wine cup. Philip's eyes darted this way and that.\n\nJohn said something to Philip in a low voice, probably a warning to say\nno more. John had the look of a water buffalo beset by village curs, his\neyes smoldering, his white-wreathed head turning from side to side.\nDaoud sensed, because he often felt the same way himself, how alone John\nmust feel, surrounded by enemies.\n\n_He does not have ten thousand warriors at his back now._\n\nDaoud heard a stir behind him, and turned to see the crowd parting to\nlet Pope Urban leave, the broad back of Fra Tomasso following close\nbehind him. A priest-attendant in black was coming from a corner of the\nroom with a cloth-of-gold outer mantle for the pope. The contessa\nrustled after Urban, who turned and offered her his hand to kiss. As the\naged hostess knelt unsteadily before Urban, Daoud rejoiced at the\ntroubled, abstracted expression in the pope's aged eyes.\n\nDaoud heaved himself out of his chair and stood, swaying. For a moment\nhis eyes would not focus, and he thought he was going to fall. Then he\nsaw John Chagan giving him a look as piercing as a Tartar lance. Now,\nDaoud saw, John understood what he had done to him. As for Philip, he\nsat slumped, only half awake, his empty wine cup held loosely. The\nstout, dark-haired Ana stood impassive, hands clasped in front of her,\nas if content to remain there all night. Her cheeks were now dry.\n\n_We defeated your army at the Well of Goliath, Tartar, and now I have\ndefeated you at Orvieto._\n\n\"Monsters!\" It was the voice of the contessa, and Daoud turned to see\nher, losing his balance and having to put out a foot to catch himself.\n\nHe saw de Verceuil as well, coming across the hall almost at a run, just\nahead of the contessa, his aquamarine cloak flying. His eyes were wide,\nhis little mouth tight with fury. The contessa, looking just as angry,\nwas hurrying to keep up with him and tell him what she thought.\n\n\"You have brought monsters into my house. Everything bad I have heard\nabout them they have now admitted. In a year or two they will be at the\ngates of Rome. They are the Huns all over again.\" Her eyes were huge,\nand her nostrils flared with passion. Daoud suppressed an urge to laugh\naloud with delight.\n\nDe Verceuil checked his rush to get to his Tartar charges, and turned to\nthe contessa. \"Your Signory, I beg you to understand. They have been\ndrinking. They did not know what they were saying. Old soldiers'\nboasting. Exaggerated tales of their exploits. The Tartars are given to\nthat sort of thing.\"\n\n\"It is not exaggerated,\" the old lady cried shrilly. \"We have heard\ntales before of their massacres. Now I have heard the same from their\nown lips. These very men whom I have welcomed into my house--their hands\ndrip with the blood of children. One of them told how he slit the\nthroats of forty babies. And they are proud of what they have done. They\nfeel no remorse. Old soldiers' boasting? Old soldiers boast of\novercoming strong enemies. These--these bestioni gloat over the\nslaughter of the helpless. Perhaps they look at my palazzo and think\nthat one day it will be theirs. And you have brought them under my\nroof.\"\n\n\"Donna Elvira,\" de Verceuil pleaded, \"let me find out the truth about\nwhat has been happening here.\"\n\nDaoud's heartbeat quickened. He should slip away now. Drunk as he was,\nhe would be too vulnerable to de Verceuil.\n\nThe French cardinal was shouting at the Bulgarian woman. John the Tartar\nwas smiling as if de Verceuil's appearance were enough in itself to\nextricate him from the consequences of his too-free speech. Philip's\nfleshy chin rested on his chest and his eyes were fast shut.\n\nSomething white moved in the corner of Daoud's eye, and he looked toward\nthe doorway leading to the inner galleria, where the gaming had been\ngoing on. Lorenzo was just sauntering out. He was all the way across the\nroom, and Daoud's vision was too blurred to see his expression, but he\nwas probably smiling. He walked closer, seeming to be looking at Daoud\nfor a signal, but Daoud could think of none to send.\n\n_Well done, Lorenzo. How badly, I wonder, did you have to play at\nbackgammon to keep de Verceuil occupied all this time?_\n\n\"How could I stop them from speaking, Your Eminence?\" Ana was\nprotesting. \"I am here only to translate what they say. This man came up\nto talk to them, and I simply repeated what they said to him and what he\nsaid back to them.\"\n\n\"What man?\" de Verceuil asked the question almost in a whisper, and\nAna's eyes turned toward Daoud.\n\n_Too late. Now I must face him._\n\n\"You,\" de Verceuil said in the same low voice.\n\nDaoud swayed, and it came to him at once how best to respond. He would\npretend to be too drunk to understand what was happening.\n\n\"You provoked these indiscretions,\" the cardinal ground out. The jeweled\ncross hanging on his chest winked and glittered as it rose and fell with\nhis deep breathing.\n\nDaoud put out a hand to grasp the back of his chair. Smiling at the\ncardinal, he leaned heavily on the chair and circled it methodically. He\nsat down heavily on the arm, almost tipping the chair over. Then he slid\ninto the seat with a thump.\n\nHe looked up at de Verceuil and said, \"What?\"\n\nThe cardinal's hands--they were very large, Daoud saw--clenched and\nunclenched.\n\n_He wishes he could strangle me._\n\n\"Why have you tried to embarrass these ambassadors?\" de Verceuil\ndemanded. His voice was a good deal louder now.\n\nDaoud let his head loll. He caught sight of Lorenzo again. The Sicilian\nwas much closer. Daoud shook his head ever so slightly and jerked his\nchin.\n\n_Go away._\n\nHe let his head fall forward.\n\nDe Verceuil moved closer. Raising his eyes while keeping his head\nlowered, Daoud found himself staring at the cardinal's belt buckle, a\ngold medallion displaying an angel's head with wings growing out of its\ncurly hair.\n\n\"I have embarrassed no one,\" Daoud mumbled thickly. \"I know John and\nPhilip's people. They are our neighbors.\" He laughed, and let the laugh\ngo on too long. \"We talked about things everybody knows.\"\n\nHe felt those big hands seize the front of his tunic and jerk him to his\nfeet. De Verceuil's flushed face was less than a hand's width from his\nown. The cardinal's eyes were huge and dark.\n\nDaoud felt his muscles bunch, and he forced them to relax. He felt fear.\nNot fear of de Verceuil, whom he could easily kill, but fear of losing\ncontrol of himself, of letting the Face of Steel show through the Mask\nof Clay. Such a revelation could put an end to his mission.\n\n\"Who the devil are you? What are you doing in Orvieto? Answer me!\" De\nVerceuil shook Daoud violently. Daoud's head rocked back and forth, and\nhe saw two faces of de Verceuil.\n\nHad there been no wine in his blood, it would have been easier for Daoud\nto control his fear and his anger. He knew he must play at being a\nmerchant who would be terrified at having provoked the wrath of a prince\nof the Church. But, as it was, he felt himself caught up in a whirlwind\nof rage, and his hands came up, going for the cardinal's throat. Just in\ntime he changed the move into a cringing, self-protective gesture.\n\n\"I could have you killed!\" de Verceuil shouted. \"And I will if you do\nnot answer me.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" The small body of Cardinal Ugolini was beside them, almost\nbetween them. \"David of Trebizond is my guest.\" Daoud glanced down at\nUgolini and saw that he was trembling violently.\n\n_He thinks I might do something that would expose us all._\n\n\"Trebizond!\" De Verceuil spat the word. \"This man is a damned schismatic\nGreek who has come here to betray Christianity!\"\n\n\"On the contrary,\" said Ugolini, \"he may yet save Christendom from a\nterrible error. De Verceuil, I demand that you take your hands off him.\"\n\nDaoud let his body go suddenly limp, so that de Verceuil was holding up\nall of his weight by his tunic. At the jerk on his arms, de Verceuil\ngave a snort of disgust and let go, pushing Daoud away from him. Daoud\ncollapsed into his chair.\n\n\"I am only a trader,\" he said plaintively to the room in general. \"I am\nsorry I ever said a word to the damned Tartars. It has meant nothing but\ntrouble for me. Why did I not remain silent?\" Adding a strong flavoring\nof drunkenness, he imitated the gestures of Greek merchants he had seen\nin the bazaars of El Kahira. He turned his head from side to side,\nsurveying the onlookers. He could not see Sophia, which was good. He\nwanted her, like Lorenzo, far away. Perhaps she was still in the garden\nwith de Gobignon.\n\nNo. Daoud saw the young French count's head. He was pushing his way\nthrough the audience.\n\nThe Contessa di Monaldeschi, her hands nervously smoothing down the\nfront of her blue velvet gown, confronted de Verceuil.\n\n\"Eminence, leave this man alone. He is a guest in this house. As you\nare, which is a thing I begin to regret.\"\n\n\"Contessa, this is all a mistake,\" said de Verceuil pleadingly. Daoud\nsuspected he feared the ignominy of finding the ambassadors and himself\nout in the street.\n\n\"It is not a mistake.\" Ugolini seemed to have plucked up his courage\nnow. \"My esteemed colleague of the Sacred College is trying to punish\nDavid because the Tartars spoke frankly to him. David made no\naccusations. The Tartars accused themselves.\"\n\nThe contessa seized Ugolini's arm. \"Oh, Your Eminence, will God be angry\nwith me for harboring these demons?\"\n\nUgolini patted her hands. \"You cannot be blamed, dear Contessa. You\nacted in good faith at the request of His Holiness himself. He, having\nheard what the Tartars said tonight, may also regret this affair.\"\n\nUgolini looked accusingly at de Verceuil, who, purple-faced, looked as\nif he wished he could tear his little colleague of the Sacred College\nlimb from limb.\n\nNow Simon de Gobignon, having broken through the circle of onlookers,\ndeclared, \"This would not have happened if Friar Mathieu had been here\ninterpreting for the Tartars, guarding them against indiscretions.\nInstead, you found this woman who is altogether ignorant of what is at\nstake here. You had her translate for the Tartars because you begrudge\nFriar Mathieu his share of the honor of this diplomatic accomplishment.\nExcept that there will be no accomplishment, because of your bungling.\"\n\nTall as de Verceuil was, de Gobignon was taller. Righteous anger made\nthe French boy's blue eyes flash.\n\nDaoud wanted to laugh aloud at the count's fury and de Verceuil's utter\nembarrassment. But he decided he should be too stupidly drunk to\nunderstand what was going on.\n\n\"You have no right to criticize me!\" de Verceuil shouted.\n\n\"Be sure that the Count d'Anjou will hear of this,\" Simon answered.\n\n_De Verceuil offending Fra Tomasso would be even better than de Verceuil\nshouting at de Gobignon. If there were a way I could make that happen.\nSophia, working through de Gobignon?_\n\nEven though his Sufi training helped him keep his mind clear, puzzling\nout this new idea was beyond his present powers after all the wine he\nhad drunk.\n\nDaoud let his head fall forward, and his eyes met the penetrating black\ngaze of John Chagan. John was drunk, and he did not speak the language\nof these people. But Daoud saw understanding in the crinkled brown face.\nJohn could not know Daoud was a Mameluke, but he knew him for an enemy.\nHe looked at Daoud with the same icy determination to annihilate all\nenemies as Daoud had seen staring at him from under the fur-and-iron\nhelmets of the Tartars at the Well of Goliath.\n\nAnd Daoud, slumped in his chair, felt the same implacable resolution he\nhad felt that day, to fight back until the last invader was driven from\nthe Dar al-Islam, the Abode of Islam.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Tartar army appeared as a darkness across the eastern horizon,\ndeepening as it spread. Curry-colored clouds towered above the\ngray-black line like mile-high djinns.\n\nThe distant thunder of hooves reached the Mameluke commanders as they\nhalted in the plain between the hills of Galilee and the mountains of\nGilboa near a village called Ain Jalut, the Well of Goliath. A fierce\nsun beat down on yellow grass and dusty tamarisks.\n\nEl Malik al-Mudhaffar Qutuz was mounted on a milk-white stallion from\nHedjaz in the midst of his emirs. Baibars al-Bunduqdari rode a\nfawn-colored half-blood mare, part Arabian and part steppe pony. Daoud,\nin his early twenties and risen through the ranks of Baibars's personal\nguard to be second in command of the orta, fifteen thousand strong, sat\non his sturdy Yemenite stallion before the other emirs. His red turban\nshaded his face and shielded his steel helmet from the sun. His chest\nwas encased in the breastplate of an emir, steel inlaid with gold.\n\nThe Mameluke emirs, bashis and muqaddams wore their fortunes into\nbattle--gold bracelets and belts, jeweled rings, necklaces of coins.\nJewels sparkled on their belt buckles and the scabbards and hilts of\ntheir scimitars, on their turbans, on the toes of their boots, on their\nfingers. Over their mail shirts and gold-inlaid breastplates the emirs\nwore velvet vests and long khalats of crimson or gold satin, lined with\nwhite silk, fastened with gold buttons, trimmed with silver thread at\nthe collars and cuffs and hems. Silk turbans were wound around their\nhelmets, red, blue, yellow, pinned with jeweled clasps and adorned with\nthe plumes of rare birds. Tied tight around their waists were wide\nshawls printed with stars and crescents. Their boots were of soft\nleather, crimson-dyed, with silver spurs, gold buckles, and pointed\ntoes.\n\n_And all that I have_, Daoud thought, _may be torn from me in an instant\ntoday_.\n\nFrom Daoud's neck hung the silver locket given to him by his first, and\nso far only, wife, Baibars's daughter Blossoming Reed. It was, she had\ntold him, a magical thing.\n\nThe Mamelukes were now the last defenders of Islam. The Tartars having\nconquered Baghdad and Damascus, El Kahira was the only remaining center\nof Muslim strength. If the Tartars overcame the Mamelukes, all that\nremained of the Dar al-Islam would lie open to the invaders, even the\nholiest place of all, Mecca, the house of God.\n\n\"We are a hundred thousand and they not a fourth of that,\" said Qutuz\nalmost petulantly, his eyes fixed on the oncoming Tartars. \"How can they\ndare to turn and fight us?\"\n\n\"They are Tartars,\" said Baibars. \"They do not fear the numbers of their\nenemies.\"\n\n\"Being a Tartar yourself, you can tell us how they think,\" said Qutuz.\nDaoud heard a faint undertone of contempt in the Kurd's voice. Baibars\nmust have heard it, too; Daoud saw his lord's cheeks darken slightly.\n\nLooking into the sultan's set face, Daoud realized that Qutuz, despite\nhis apparent disdain, had already given up the battle. His lips, almost\nhidden in his oiled black beard, were pressed tight, in an effort to\nkeep them from trembling.\n\nThe Mamelukes might outnumber the Tartars today, but the Tartars had\nnever been defeated anywhere in the world. The sultan must have led the\narmy to what he saw as certain death, for himself and all of them, only\nbecause he knew his Mameluke emirs would depose and kill him if he did\nnot.\n\n_How can a Mameluke fear death, or even defeat? Qutuz has been sultan\ntoo long._\n\n\"With the help of God, my brothers,\" said Qutuz, his voice hollow, \"let\nus ride forth and slay them. I will command the center, Kalawun the left\nwing, and Baibars the right. When you see my green banner dip, we will\nadvance to surround and destroy them.\"\n\n_He does not believe that God will help him_, thought Daoud. _And he\ndoes not believe he can help himself._\n\nRiding over the dusty field to rejoin the men under his command, Daoud\nyearned for the fighting to begin. His body felt tight, as if it were\nbeing pressed inward from all directions, and his heart seemed to swell\nin his chest, trying to break out of the pressure.\n\n_If I must die today, let me first do a great deed for God!_\n\nBy the time the oncoming Tartars were clearly visible, Daoud was back\nwith the right wing of the Mameluke army, at the head of his own troop.\nThe Tartars came on at an unhurried trot, spread out in a series of long\nranks, one behind the other, and he could see their fur-trimmed helmets,\ntheir waving lances, their colored signal flags. He could hear their\nshrill war cries and the braying of their horns. Above their front rank\nflew their savage standard, rows of long black tails of animals waving\nfrom crossbars mounted on a tall pole.\n\nDrawn up across the plain behind Baibars's yellow banner were dark\nranks of Mameluke heavy cavalrymen armed with tall spears and wearing\nsteel chain mail and helmets.\n\nDaoud saw Qutuz's green flag, small and far to the west, dip, heard\nBaibars's cry, relayed the shout to his men.\n\nIn a moment the parched earth of the plain of the Well of Goliath was\ntrembling under the hooves of fifteen thousand Mameluke horses. The\nkettledrums of Baibars's tablkhana, his camel-mounted band, thundered,\nand the trumpets blared, sending Daoud's blood racing.\n\nDaoud drew his double-curved bow of horn and sinew out of the case\nhanging from his saddle and nocked an arrow as the galloping hooves of\nhis horse jolted his body. He let his voice pour out of him in a long\nscream.\n\nThe braying of the Tartars' signal horns floated over the plain. They,\ntoo, were galloping, bent over the necks of their ponies. The Tartar\nhorses were short-legged, their barrel-shaped bodies encased in leather\narmor.\n\n_Ugly little horses_, Daoud thought.\n\nThe ponies of the Tartar unit passing him all appeared to be white with\nblack spots. The Tartars' tunics were brown, their trousers gray, and\ntheir fur-trimmed iron helmets painted red.\n\nAhead of him Daoud saw Baibars's yellow standard fluttering against a\nsky gray with dust. Baibars's wing and the Tartars were riding past each\nother. The emir was leading his men eastward. To Daoud's left, across an\nempty space of grassy plain, the Tartar army was passing them, charging\nto the west. Arrows flew from the Tartars, but singly, not in volleys.\nDaoud loosed an arrow of his own at the passing horde. It arced over the\nbare strip between the two armies and fell in the Tartar mass without\nresult that he could see.\n\nHe looked back toward the center of the Mameluke host and saw small\nfigures in white robes striding through the grass. They were holy men,\nhe knew, dervishes dedicated to death. As they marched on foot and\nunarmed against the Tartars, they were calling on God to avenge the\nmartyrs of Islam. Arrows flew at them from the Tartar lines, and in an\ninstant it seemed the dervishes vanished as they crumpled into the tall\ngrass.\n\n_They are showing all of us how to die_, thought Daoud. By going\njoyfully to their deaths, the dervishes reminded the Mamelukes that each\nwarrior who died here today would be a mujahid, one who fell in holy war\nfor Islam. Such a one was destined for paradise.\n\nBut he also realized uneasily that he had seen a demonstration of Tartar\nmarksmanship.\n\nSignal flags, yellow, green, and red, fluttered among the Tartar\nhorsemen, and horns bellowed. Daoud heard the pounding of a great\nbattery of drums. From twenty thousand Tartar throats at once there rose\na long, terrifying scream. Daoud turned in the saddle to see the entire\nTartar army, now in a wedge formation, the beast-tail standard at the\npoint of the triangle rushing upon the green banner of Sultan Qutuz.\n\nA blue flag fluttered beside Baibars's yellow one. The signal to halt.\nDaoud raised his arm and shouted the order to his troop. The Mameluke\nright wing rumbled to a stop and turned their horses to face the\nfighting that had just passed them by. Reining up his horse, Daoud put\nhis bow back in its case.\n\nHe blinked as bright bursts of light flashed above the distant ranks in\nthe center of the Mameluke army. Swiftly that part of the field was\nenveloped in thick clouds of brown smoke. A moment later he heard\npopping sounds like the cracking of innumerable boards. The dim shapes\nof horses plunged and reared in the smoke.\n\nHe heard his men muttering to one another behind him.\n\n_They think it is sorcery._\n\nDaoud, having seen the Tartar army in action when he visited Baghdad\ndisguised as a Christian trader, recognized the fiery noisemakers.\n\nHe turned and shouted, \"It is not magic. I've seen this before. It is\nlike Greek Fire, but it does not hurt. It just makes noise and smoke.\"\n\nHe saw smiles of relief among those who had heard him. They would pass\nthe word to the others farther back, and the troops would settle down.\n\nHe peered anxiously into the chaos of smoke and dust and horses and men,\ntrying to see the Tartar standard, with its long black tails, and\nQutuz's green banner. They had been close together when he last saw\nthem. Now he could not find them.\n\nA movement near the western horizon caught his eye. He saw a bit of\ngreen waving just below the blue Galilee hills that separated this plain\nof Esdraelon from the coast. Qutuz's banner, smaller, farther away.\n\nDespair clutched at Daoud. But Qutuz could be feigning a retreat to lure\nthe Tartars into spreading themselves too thin. Then he saw the black\nTartar standard, much closer, in the midst of a furious melee of\nfighting men and falling horses half obscured by dust. Qutuz would not\nleave part of the center behind to fight the Tartars unless he were\nrunning away. Daoud remembered the tightness he had seen in Qutuz's face\nbefore the battle, the hopelessness in the sultan's voice.\n\n_He is fleeing in terror. We are all dead men. Islam is lost._\n\nDaoud looked to the east and saw that Baibars was still sitting\nmotionless, a small figure at this distance on his fawn half-blood, the\nbearer with the yellow standard sitting behind him.\n\nDaoud turned in the saddle and swept his gaze over the long line of his\nown troop. Their red turbans bobbed up and down as their horses danced.\nThe wind was from the north, and their scarlet cloaks fluttered behind\nthem. The bearded faces in the front rank were grave, but there was no\nfear. There was no murmuring now, no questioning. Their mounts, brown,\nwhite, and black, the finest steeds in al-Islam, stood with necks\nstretched and ears laid back, eager for the charge.\n\nAn orange pennant beside Baibars's standard summoned the commanders to\nconfer with their leader.\n\n\"I go to the emir for orders,\" Daoud said loudly, so they would not\nthink he was fleeing the field.\n\nBy the time he reached Baibars, a half circle of five emirs and ten\nbashis had formed around their commander. Daoud could hear Baibars\nmuttering to himself in his boyhood Kipchaq tongue. Curses, no doubt.\n\nFar to the north Daoud saw horsemen riding westward, away from the\nbattlefield. The left wing, under Kalawun. The Tartars had come nowhere\nnear them. They must have given way to fear when they saw the center\nfall back.\n\nDaoud saw no fear in Baibars's brown face. His wide mouth with its thin\nlips was formed in a half smile. The expression around his eyes, the\nblue one that saw so deeply and the opaque white, was calm and\nconfident. He pulled on his reins to turn his half-blood so that his\nback was to the field of battle.\n\n\"Most of our army has fled.\" His voice was deep and so full of\nconfidence Daoud almost thought he heard laughter in it. \"The Tartars\nthink they have won. Now, therefore, let us ride against them.\"\n\nThe commanders looked at one another in wonderment.\n\nBuoyed up by Baibars's calm strength, Daoud felt himself despising the\nofficers under his and Baibars's command.\n\n_They think Baibars is mad. To the devil with them. Even if he is mad, I\nwill follow him and die with him._\n\nThe thought occurred to him that if Baibars should fall--God\nforbid!--then he would have to lead these fifteen thousand men. For a\nmoment he was seized by fear, whether of his lord's death or of having\nto lead alone, he was not sure.\n\nBaibars saw the disbelief of his officers. \"You do not deserve to ride\nwith me,\" he said, and now there was scorn in his tone. \"Have you not\nalways risked death in battle? Can the Tartars do more to you than kill\nyou? I tell you, if we are defeated, better to die here than live as\nfugitives. Now go to your troops. In a moment you will see my standard\nmove against them. Do as you will, follow or run away as you choose, and\nGod will reward you accordingly. If I must, I will ride alone.\"\n\nDaoud felt the blood rush to his head in dizzy excitement.\n\n\"You will not ride alone, Lord,\" said Daoud fiercely.\n\n\"No, Bunduqdari, no,\" said another emir, Bektout, a Kipchaq like\nBaibars. \"Let us offer our lives to God and ride out with light hearts.\"\n\nThe other officers shouted their eagerness to die for Islam. Daoud felt\nfull of gratitude. Baibars had put the spirit of war back into them. He\nhad done what Qutuz could never do.\n\nAfter the other emirs had ridden back to their troops, Baibars said\nquietly to Daoud, \"I truly believe I will win. Until the instant that\nthey kill me, I will know that I am winning.\"\n\nBack at the head of his own troop, Daoud watched Baibars and waited. For\na moment a silence fell over this part of the field. The drumming of\nhooves, the clash of steel, and the screams of men carried clearly from\nfar to the west.\n\nBaibars on horseback sat a short distance in front of the long dark\nranks of Mamelukes. He turned and beckoned to his standard bearer, who\ntrotted forward bearing the yellow silk banner inscribed with the words\nof the Koran in black letters, \"For the safety of the faith, slay the\nenemies of Islam.\"\n\nBaibars took the banner in his right hand and held it high, then lowered\nit till its end rested in a leather socket beside his foot. In his left\nhand, his sword hand, his long, curved saif, inlaid with gold, flashed\nin the sunlight. His fawn half-blood pawed the air with her front\nhooves.\n\n\"Oh, God, give us victory!\" he shouted. \"Yah l'Allah!\"\n\nAn echoing roar came back from the ranks of the right wing. Half\nstanding in his copper stirrups, guiding his mare with the pressure of\nhis legs, Baibars sent her into a headlong gallop. Daoud struck his\nspurs into his own horse's flanks and raced after him. He squinted into\nthe wind that blew his beard back against his neck.\n\nThe dark blur of struggling Tartars and Mamelukes grew rapidly larger.\nQutuz's banner was nowhere to be seen, but the beast-tail Tartar\nstandard rose up in the west, and Kalawun's black banner was waving far\nto the north.\n\nThey were coming on the Tartar horsemen from the flank and rear. Daoud\nwas close enough to see faces turn and Tartars wheel their ponies to\nmeet the attack.\n\nDaoud drew his bow out again, picked a big Tartar with a drooping black\nmustache, and loosed an arrow at him. The Tartar fell back over his gray\npony's rump, and the pony slowed, trotted out of the Tartar formation,\nand stood nibbling on the tall dead grass while its dead master lay\nnearby.\n\nThree Tartars peeled off from their formation and charged at Daoud. His\narrows took two of them, and an arrow from one of his men struck down\nthe third.\n\nElated, he whispered a prayer of thanks to God. Baibars's yellow\nstandard changed direction. Following it, Daoud pulled his horse around\nand raced away from the Tartars. He stood in the stirrups, bow and an\narrow in hand with a steel-tipped armor-piercing arrow nocked. Resting\nhis right knee against his heavy wood and leather saddle, he turned\nuntil he was looking over his horse's rear and took careful aim. To\nsteady his aim, he fired the arrow just after his horse's four feet\nstruck the ground. He saw a Tartar thrown off his pony by the force of\nthe arrow, and he laughed aloud.\n\nHe saw files of Tartars pulling away from the main formation, which was\npursuing Qutuz and Kalawun. Baibars's attack was pulling the Tartars\napart.\n\nLove for Baibars surged within him. The Tartars were said to be masters\nof warfare, but Baibars could out-general even them.\n\nFollowing the yellow standard, Daoud rode back and forth over the field.\nHe lost all sense of the progress of the battle. For brief moments he\ntook his eyes off the enemy warriors to glance up at the sun, a pale\ndisk visible through a haze of smoke and dust, to see in which direction\nhe was riding.\n\nMany times he shot his last arrow, got down from his horse and, standing\nin the grass with horsemen galloping all around him, refilled his\nquiver from those of fallen Mamelukes and from the bodies of Tartars.\n\nMounted or on foot, he felt as if no arrow or sword could touch him. He\nseemed, when he had ridden out to battle, to have left fear somewhere\nbehind.\n\nHe recognized Mamelukes from other ortas riding beside him, and his\nhopes leapt at the sight of them. They must have come back to join the\nbattle from the shattered left wing and center.\n\nFollowing the yellow standard, he saw that the Tartars were now always\non his left. For the most part, he kept his eyes on them and stayed\nclose to the other Mamelukes. The plain was almost featureless, but\nglancing to his right from time to time, he noticed certain twisted\ntrees and black boulders he was sure he had passed before.\n\nThe sun was halfway between the zenith and the western horizon when the\nyellow standard halted. The Mamelukes turned to face the Tartars, whose\nstandard rose from their midst. Looking to either side, Daoud saw\ncurving lines of mounted Mamelukes stretching until they disappeared\naround the edges of the packed Tartar mass.\n\nWhat had happened? Baibars's refusal to abandon the field and the\ngreater numbers of the Mamelukes must have tipped the scales. Daoud's\nheart pounded with joy as he realized that they had ground down the\nnumbers of the Tartars and surrounded the survivors.\n\nBaibars, down the Mameluke line, called out, \"Finish them. One by one.\nHand to hand.\"\n\nHe still held high the banner of the orta. He raised his curved saif and\npointed it at the Tartars.\n\nHe turned toward Daoud for a moment, and Daoud saw the exaltation in his\nface. Baibars's face was coated with gray dust. His gold khalat was\nstreaked with blood, and none of it, Daoud was sure, was his. An angel\nmust be riding on his shoulder.\n\nWith another wave of his saif Baibars charged into the mass of Tartars.\nHowling in an ecstasy of fury, the rest of the Mamelukes rushed after\nhim.\n\nDaoud reached over his shoulder and pulled his curving, double-edged\nsaif from its leather-covered scabbard. He tried to ride near Baibars,\nbut a wall of Tartars rose up between them. While he fought for his own\nlife, Daoud could only pray that God would protect Baibars.\n\nAnd then he was no longer fighting many Tartars, but just one. They had\nchosen each other out of the struggling multitudes, like partners in a\ndance.\n\nDaoud saw his man as vividly as if he had been staring at him for hours.\nRed ribbons fluttered from the sides of his fur-trimmed iron helmet. The\nends of his black mustache hung down on either side of his mouth like\nwhiplashes. His cheeks and chin bore the ridges of thick scars he seemed\nto have cut into his flesh. His nose had been crushed in some past\nbattle, and it was a shapeless lump between his jutting cheekbones. His\neyes were hard and expressionless.\n\nDaoud rode at the Tartar eagerly, rejoicing that for now the battle was\nbetween himself and this one man. For him now this Tartar was all\nTartars.\n\nThe scarred brown face was utterly concentrated on a single purpose, to\nkill Daoud. The Tartar reminded Daoud of a tale told by a storyteller in\na bazaar at El Kahira of invincible bronze warriors, statues brought to\nlife by a magician.\n\nDaoud's Yemenite stallion leapt at the Tartar as Daoud brought his saif\ndown.\n\nThe Tartar raised his round leather-covered shield and easily caught the\nblow of Daoud's sword while swinging his own scimitar around at Daoud's\nchest. The blade struck Daoud's ribs on the left side. The cunningly\nwoven rings of Damascene steel under Daoud's tunic stopped the edge of\nthe blade, but the blow sent a shock of pain through his body.\n\nDaoud struck downward again with his saif and chopped a deep gash in the\nTartar's shield. The force of the blow hurt Daoud's arm. His tall\nYemenite and the Tartar's piebald pony pranced in a cloud of dust as\ntheir riders slashed at each other. The Tartar's brown tunic hung in\nribbons.\n\nDaoud saw a spot of sunlight reflected from his silver locket flash in\nthe Tartar's eyes. The Tartar glanced at Daoud's chest, his eyes caught\nby the light. In that instant Daoud thrust straight at his enemy's\nthroat.\n\nHe thought he had no chance of hitting the right spot, but the point of\nhis saif went in just below the Tartar's chin and above his high leather\ncollar. Blood poured after the sword's point as Daoud jerked it out.\n\n_Praise God!_ Daoud thought with delight as he saw that he had won. And\nhe thought with thankfulness of Blossoming Reed, for her gift of the\nlocket.\n\nFor the first time, an instant away from death, an expression of feeling\ncrossed the Tartar's face. His lips parted and the corners of his mouth\npulled down in a grimace of pain and disgust.\n\nDaoud had to parry one more blow of the scimitar before the Tartar\nslumped over in the saddle and slid to the ground, disappearing in the\ndust kicked up by the hooves of a dozen milling horses. In his last\nmoment the Tartar had still been trying to kill him.\n\n\"We have destroyed them!\" a voice cried near him. It was Mahmoud, naqeeb\nof Daoud's old training troop. He now wore the plain gold belt buckle of\nan emir of drums, in command of forty mounted warriors. His beard was\nwhiter now, but he rode easily and held his scimitar with a young man's\nstrength.\n\nMamelukes rode forward on all sides of Daoud, their saifs stabbing the\nair.\n\nThe victory whoops of his fellow Mamelukes were, for Daoud, a draft of\nelixir from paradise filling him with new strength.\n\n\"Great Baibars, honor to his name, has defeated those who never knew\ndefeat!\" Mahmoud exulted.\n\nAs the last word left his lips, a Tartar arrow, long as a javelin,\nthudded into his chest. He gasped, and his pain-filled eyes met Daoud's.\nHe dropped his scimitar and his hand reached out to grasp Daoud's arm.\n\n\"A good moment,\" he grated. \"Praise God!\" He slumped in the saddle, the\nflowing white beard fluttering in the east wind.\n\nGrief shot through Daoud like the Tartar arrow that had pierced his old\nnaqeeb.\n\nDaoud knew what Mahmoud's last words meant. It was the best of moments\nto die. A moment of triumph.\n\n_But a moment of grief for me, Mahmoud, because I have seen you die._\n\nDaoud rode forward over dead Tartars to the place where the enemy had\nplanted their standard, on a small hill. Bunched together, the last few\nTartars fought on foot.\n\nA fierce joy swept Daoud. Victory! He had believed that God would not\nallow Islam's last defenders to be defeated, but the wonder of a triumph\nover the invincible Tartars was so overwhelming that he almost fell from\nhis saddle.\n\nIn the midst of the Tartars one man dashed this way and that, shouting\norders to the few dozen men as if they were still thousands. He wore a\ngold tablet stamped with symbols on a chain around his neck, the badge\nof a high-ranking Tartar officer. Scouts had reported that this Tartar\narmy was commanded by one called Ket Bogha. This must be he.\n\nKet Bogha shot arrows into the tightening circle of Mamelukes until he\nhad no more arrows left. He threw javelins. Then he stood with his sword\nheld before him, not the usual Tartar saber, but a two-handed sword that\nhe swung ferociously at anyone who approached.\n\nWith a single swipe of his sword Ket Bogha cut off the foreleg of a\nhorse that rode at him. The horse toppled screaming to the ground, and\nthe rider barely managed to jump free and run away as Ket Bogha slashed\nat him.\n\nThe battle ended for Ket Bogha as six naqeebs clubbed the Tartar general\nto the ground with the butt ends of their lances.\n\n_He deserved better than that_, Daoud thought sadly.\n\nBut the momentary sympathy for his conquered enemy was swept away in the\necstatic floodtide of triumph. Now the battle was truly over! And the\nMamelukes had won over the Tartars.\n\nThe naqeebs bound Ket Bogha's arms. Baibars himself dismounted and took\nthe Tartar general's great sword and tied it to his own saddle, then\nlifted the gold tablet from around his neck and dropped it into his\nsaddle pack. Smiling, he spoke to Ket Bogha in the language of the\nTartars and tied a rope around his neck. Then he mounted his own\nfawn-colored mare and led the defeated general past heaps of Tartar and\nMameluke dead and clusters of rejoicing Muslim warriors. Daoud, and then\nBaibars's other emirs and bashis followed.\n\nThe standard of Qutuz was back on the field, looking more black than\ngreen with the afternoon sun behind it.\n\n\"Can it be? Can it be that we have truly won?\" Mamelukes cried, running\nbeside Baibars's horse.\n\n\"Baibars! Yah, Baibars!\" cried the warriors as Baibars rode slowly over\nthe field.\n\n\"Tell us, Baibars, that we have won!\"\n\nAs an answer Baibars gestured grandly to his captive stumbling along\nbehind him.\n\n\"Baibars, bringer of victory!\"\n\nThe sultan's servants were already setting up his gold silk pavilion on\nthe edge of the battlefield. When Baibars rode before Qutuz, pulling Ket\nBogha, a deafening roar went up from the emirs, the bashis, the\nmuqaddams, the naqeebs, the troopers.\n\nDaoud glanced at Qutuz and saw that his eyes were wide and his face\npale. He must still be dazed by the outcome of this battle.\n\nBut the sultan stepped forward to peer at Ket Bogha as the Tartar\ngeneral was freed from Baibars's rope. Qutuz gestured to his men to\nuntie Ket Bogha. A circle of emirs formed around Qutuz and the Tartar\ncommander, to hear what they would say to each other.\n\nQutuz had found time at the end of the battle to have his black beard\ncombed and oiled and to robe himself afresh. His black and gold khalat\nglittered in the hazy sunlight. The Mamelukes had stripped Ket Bogha of\nhis armor, and he stood before the sultan in a dirty, bloodstained tunic\nthat had once been a bright blue. His shaven head was round as a ball,\nand, like most Tartars Daoud had seen, his short legs were bowed from a\nlifetime in the saddle.\n\nOnce again Daoud felt sorrow for the Tartar leader, who looked like a\nlonely island in the midst of a sea of joy.\n\nSince Baibars spoke both Tartar and Arabic, he stood between the sultan\nand the Tartar general to translate.\n\n\"You have overthrown kingdoms from the Jordan to the Roof of the World,\"\nsaid Qutuz through Baibars. \"How does it feel to be defeated yourself?\"\n\nReleased from his bonds, Ket Bogha paced furiously back and forth before\nQutuz. He started to talk so rapidly the interpreter could not keep up\nwith him.\n\nDaoud was amazed to see that he actually seemed to be laughing at what\nQutuz had said.\n\n_He still feels the excitement of the battle_, Daoud thought. _And by\nwalking and talking as he does, he keeps at bay his grief at the loss of\nhis army. His words are as much for himself as for the sultan and the\nemirs._\n\n\"Defeat?\" said Baibars, speaking Ket Bogha's words. \"Oh, Sultan, do not\nplay the fool by claiming this skirmish as a victory. You rashly chose\nto overrun this handful of men, but the harm you have done to Hulagu\nKhan is that which a gnat does to an elephant. You have not hurt him.\nYou have angered him. The men and horses he has lost here, the wives of\nhis soldiers and the mares in his paddocks will make up in a single\nnight.\"\n\n\"You talk like some old storyteller in the marketplace who tries to\nfrighten children,\" said Qutuz in a shrill voice.\n\n_The amazement all of us feel, that we are not only alive but\nvictorious, must be even stronger in Qutuz. Most of my Mameluke\ncomrades may think that their sultan planned for victory all along. But\nhe himself knows better._\n\nKet Bogha stopped pacing and pointed a stubby finger at Qutuz. \"Soon\nHulagu Khan will return from beyond the Oxus and the hooves of his\nhorses will trample your land all the way to the Nile and beyond. He\nwill do to your Cairo what he did to Baghdad.\"\n\nQutuz laughed harshly. \"Your faith in your master is touching, but I\nwill have your head carried before me on a spear when I ride back to\nEgypt. He cannot save you from that.\"\n\n\"I would rather die for my khan than be like you, one who rose to power\nby murdering his rightful lord!\" Ket Bogha cried.\n\nBaibars smiled wryly as he repeated the Tartar's words in Arabic.\n\nQutuz went white with fury. \"Take him away and cut his head off,\" he\nordered. \"And you, Baibars, how dare you repeat such a slander to me? I\nnever murdered anyone.\"\n\nQutuz's command revolted Daoud. After the poor part the sultan had\nplayed in the battle, he had no right to take the head of a brave enemy.\nDaoud heard Baibars give a little snort of disgust, and the emir strode\nto Qutuz's side.\n\nBaibars spoke in a low voice, but Daoud heard him. \"My Lord, this is not\nworthy of a sultan in his hour of victory. This is a brave commander,\nand I repeated all that he said because you wished me to.\"\n\nQutuz glared wildly at Baibars. \"Be still! I will not spare your fellow\nTartar.\"\n\nQutuz, Daoud thought with smoldering wrath, was not worthy to be sultan.\n\nBaibars turned his back on Qutuz. The brown face was impassive, but in\nthe one blue eye Daoud saw death.\n\n\n\n\nXXIII\n\n\nThe rats scavenged in the garbage and the cats hunted the rats. And cats\nand rats scurried out of the way of the two men who staggered beneath a\nwaning moon through the streets of Orvieto.\n\n\"I was truly drunk,\" said Daoud. \"But only my body was drunk. It is\nstill drunk.\" He walked with one arm thrown over Lorenzo's shoulder to\nsteady his steps. It must have rained during the evening. The streets\nwere slippery, and the clean, vaporous scent of drying rain was stronger\nthan the usual odor of rotting rubbish piled between the houses in the\nspaces the Orvietans called quintane.\n\n\"You feign the extremity of drunkenness quite well,\" said Lorenzo. They\nhad met by prearrangement on the street outside the Monaldeschi palace.\nSophia and Cardinal Ugolini left earlier and separately, carried in\nsedan chairs and escorted by the cardinal's guards.\n\n\"What hour is it?\" Daoud asked.\n\n\"Past the third nocturn. Do you know what that means?\"\n\n\"It was explained to me once, but now my memory seems to be drunk.\"\n\n\"Simply, dawn is not far off,\" said Celino. \"The third nocturn is\nbetween midnight and dawn. The contessa's reception began at the first\nnocturn, between sunset and midnight. Tell me, did you never experience\nwine in Egypt?\"\n\nDaoud decided that, much as he liked Lorenzo, he did not want to confide\nany of Saadi's most secret teachings to an atheist.\n\n\"Many times we stayed up all night, drinking kaviyeh, talking and\nwatching the dancers. But we do not drink wine.\"\n\n\"Really?\" said Lorenzo, glancing at him. \"Permit me to be skeptical. I\nknow many Muslims who drink wine.\"\n\nDaoud shook his head. \"Most Mamelukes do not drink wine. When Baibars\nbecame sultan, he closed all the wine shops in El Kahira.\" He also\ndecided not to tell Lorenzo that in private Baibars enjoyed the Tartar\ndrink kumiss, made from the fermented milk of mares.\n\nLorenzo grunted. \"Then you Mamelukes are stricter in your observance\nthan many others who were born to Islam.\"\n\nThey passed the cathedral of San Giovenale. It was lit within, and the\nnarrow stained glass windows glowed red, yellow, blue, and white.\n\n_You go into a Christian church during the day, and the windows are all\nalight with colors. At night the windows are black if you are inside the\nchurch but brightly lit if you are outside. As if the church is calling\nto those outside in the darkness._\n\n\"So beautiful,\" Daoud said, \"even if the images were idolatrous.\"\n\n\"You should see some of the new cathedrals up near Paris. The windows\nare much bigger, and the figures are more lifelike.\"\n\n\"Do you admire the Christian churches?\" Daoud asked.\n\n\"I admire beauty wherever I find it. On Sicily, there are beautiful\nstained glass windows in many synagogues.\"\n\n\"We are building a mosque in El Kahira that will be the wonder of the\nworld. But when were you in Paris?\"\n\n\"Four years ago, on a mission for King Manfred.\"\n\n_Four years ago I was battling Tartars in Palestine._\n\nAs they passed the open front doors of the cathedral, Daoud looked up\nthe steps. He saw the bright yellow light of massed candles and heard a\nchorus of male voices raised in song. The voices seemed thin and high,\nas if reaching up into the night sky. He had heard such singing\nbefore--a long time before. He felt a catch in his throat.\n\n\"Why are the priests singing so late at night?\"\n\n\"Those are the priests of the cathedral chapter. It is the beginning of\nday for them. They are chanting lauds, the dawn prayer of the Church.\"\n\nListening to the voices, Daoud felt hot tears running down his face.\n\nLorenzo glanced at him and chuckled. \"I see you are not so impervious to\nthe attractions of Christianity.\"\n\nDaoud was embarrassed, but he could not stop the flow of tears. \"It is\nthe wine.\"\n\nHe was remembering high mass in the chapel of the castle, with his\nfather's hand on his shoulder as they knelt and the chief priest in\ndazzling white and gold cope raised the white wafer toward heaven. His\nfather whispered, \"Jesus is come down among us,\" and then his strong\ntenor voice joined in \"Veni Creator Spiritus.\"\n\n_I weep now for my father because I had no chance to weep for him when\nhe was killed._\n\n\"Suppose he is in some Christian heaven looking down at me. What would\nhe think?\"\n\nDaoud started at the sound of his own words.\n\n_I must be drunk. I would never speak so in front of Lorenzo--or\nanyone--otherwise._\n\n\"Who is looking down at you?\" Lorenzo asked. His shoulders were hard and\nbroad under Daoud's arm, and he seemed to bear Daoud's weight without\nthe least difficulty. They were past the cathedral now, following a\nstraight, fairly wide street that gently sloped downward. Broken clouds\ndrifted away from the half moon. Like a watchman's lantern it hung over\nthe center of the street, between the overhanging second stories of the\nhouses.\n\n\"My father,\" said Daoud, and a sob bubbled up in his throat as he softly\nspoke the word, albeit in the unfamiliar tongue of Italy. \"How he must\nhate me and curse me for fighting for Islam.\"\n\nLorenzo halted his stride and lifted his head. Then he started walking\nagain. He raised his hand and gripped the wrist Daoud was resting on his\nshoulder.\n\nIn a very low voice he said, \"Someone is following us.\"\n\nNow Daoud stopped, tensing. He called on the power of his mind to resist\nthe wine. His tears dried on the instant.\n\n\"Walk on,\" said Lorenzo in a low voice. \"Keep your arm over my shoulder.\nKeep talking to me.\" In a louder voice he said, \"I do not believe\npeople's souls go to a heaven of any sort.\"\n\n\"Can they hear us?\" Daoud said softly. De Verceuil, he thought. He must\nhave decided to have me killed. His body felt cold. His journey from\nEgypt and all his work, despite tonight's triumph, might end here on a\nrain-wet street. And what would happen to Sophia if he were killed?\n\n\"They cannot hear what we say. But careful, they might be able to tell\nfrom the tone of our voices whether we are aware of them. Can you\nfight?\"\n\n\"Not well. Not well at all.\" The Scorpion, the small crossbow hidden in\nhis cloak, he thought, might account for one or two of them, if he could\nsee well enough to aim it. He blinked his eyes. He saw two moons hanging\nover the street, blinked again, and saw one.\n\n\"Do not Jews believe in an immortal soul?\" he asked in a normal voice,\nkeeping up the pretense of conversation.\n\nHe cursed his lack of foresight. Why had he not thought to arrange for\nsome of their bravos to meet them and escort them back to Ugolini's\npalace? Because he did not want himself connected with the fighting men\nLorenzo had brought to Orvieto. That it had been a sensible precaution\ndid not ease his anguish now.\n\n\"Maimonides writes that men and women live on after they die only in the\nmemory of others,\" said Lorenzo. \"Of course, orthodox rabbis say that\nMaimonides was a heretic.\"\n\n\"If the dead live on only in memory, then my father is truly dead,\nbecause I have done nothing for his memory, and I fight against all that\nhe fought for.\"\n\nDaoud realized that his wine-numbed mind was hardly working. He was\nrelying on Lorenzo to think of some way to get them through this. He\nhated having his life depend on another man's cleverness. He tried to\nfree his thoughts from the poisonous grip of al-koahl. It had been\neasier earlier this evening, but he was very tired now.\n\n\"I prefer to believe that people become more broadminded after they\ndie,\" said Lorenzo. \"They come face-to-face with the truth, whatever it\nis, and they see how each of us, Turk and Jew and Christian, has been\nstruggling to uphold a dimly glimpsed version of what they see plainly.\nIf they do not feel sorry for us, then probably they laugh at us.\n\n\"And now, this way. Move as silently as you can.\"\n\nAbruptly, holding tight to Daoud's wrist, Lorenzo made a sharp left turn\ninto an alley so narrow it was almost invisible. It was scarcely more\nthan a quintana, a tunnel rather than an alley; the overhanging second\nstories of the houses on either side actually had a wall in common.\n\nLorenzo pulling him, Daoud broke into a trot. All around them was a hot\nblackness reeking of decay. Daoud could hear creatures scrabbling out of\nhis way. Ahead was a bluish oblong--the end of the tunnel and the\nmoonlit space beyond it.\n\nThey stopped abruptly. Lorenzo swung Daoud's arm down and stepped away\nfrom him, gripping him briefly by the shoulders to brace him.\n\n\"Now you must clear your head, Messer David. I hear them coming. I think\nthey saw us duck in here. Get out your sword or your dagger, whatever\nsuits you best, and get ready to fight.\"\n\nDaoud heard the sound of running boots. He tried to guess how many\npursuers there were, but his head was not clear enough of wine fumes for\nthat. He fell against the rough plaster wall. Could he and Lorenzo break\nthrough a doorway into a house and hide there? No, the people within\nwould probably give them away.\n\nHe heard the slithering sound of Lorenzo's sword being drawn. He decided\nnot to use the Scorpion. It would take too long to load and cock it, and\nif he fumbled, he would be cut down without a second chance.\n\nHis mind was fairly clear of the toxic power of al-koahl, but his body,\nstill in its grip, felt half dead to him.\n\n_How can I fight, as dizzy as I am? Thou hast said it, O God, wine is an\nabomination. Forgive me for drinking it, and help me now._\n\nHe reached for his sword, the handsome new one he had bought in Orvieto.\nHe drew it out slowly, as quietly as he could, and hefted it in his\nhand. A bit late now to wonder how it would stand up in a fight.\n\nThe running footsteps stopped suddenly. Looking at the end of the alley,\nDaoud saw figures silhouetted by the moonlight. He heard voices\nmurmuring. Then the figures seemed to fill the rectangular mouth of the\nalley. There seemed to be six of them. They moved slowly, cautiously.\n\n\"Capons,\" whispered Lorenzo. \"Afraid to charge us. Let us move to where\nthere is light to fight by.\"\n\nHe pulled Daoud after him. Daoud felt his head clearing. He could hear\nbetter and, despite the darkness, see better. But he staggered as they\nran out of the alley.\n\nThey found themselves in a campiello, a courtyard surrounded by houses.\nIn the center, on a small pedestal, was a statue, one of their saint\nidols, with arms outstretched. Daoud looked quickly around him. There\nseemed to be no way out but the alleyway they had entered through.\n\nHe heard a loud thump to his right. A dark figure suddenly stood there.\nAnother thump on the left, and another in front. Men were jumping down\nfrom the rooftops.\n\nIn a moment, four men in a rough semicircle faced Lorenzo and Daoud.\nBlades gleamed silvery in the moonlight.\n\nThe six others who had been pursuing them rushed out of the alley.\n\nFilled with a despairing rage, Daoud clenched his teeth and raised his\nsword.\n\n\n\n\nXXIV\n\n\nRachel's body felt cold. She knew the night outside was warm despite the\nlateness of the hour, and the room was stifling, with all its candles\nand the heavy silk draperies that held in the heat. But her feet and\nhands were icy. It was fear that chilled her so as she sat half\nlistening to Tilia. She huddled in a corner of the big bed, her feet\ntucked under her, her hands clenched in her lap. She wanted to jump out\nthe window.\n\nOnly, she was here of her own free will. And anyway the window was\nbarred.\n\n\"We will be watching through spy holes in the walls,\" said Tilia. \"There\nwill be at least three of us. If he hurts you in any way, we will be\nhere in a trice to rescue you.\"\n\nTilia Caballo had a face like a frog, Rachel thought. The fat old woman\nwas trying to be reassuring, but just now Rachel hated her. She could\nnot believe Tilia would interfere with a wealthy client's pleasure no\nmatter how badly a girl of hers was being hurt.\n\nThe skepticism must have shown in her face, because Tilia had said, \"I\nknow this man. He has been here five times. He is not the kind that\nlikes to hurt women. I do have patrons of that sort. For them I supply\nwomen like Olivia. Sometime when you are not so frightened I may tell\nyou what Olivia likes men to do to her. Of course, she pretends not to\nlike it. Her clients would get no pleasure if they knew Olivia _wanted_\nthem to do what they do. But no matter how I gain my livelihood, I am\nstill a woman of honor.\" She glowered fiercely at Rachel, jowls\nquivering slightly. \"I do not allow certain things to take place in my\nhouse. I do not allow my women to be mistreated.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Rachel. \"That is why I have not run away.\"\n\n\"You need not speak of running away,\" said Tilia loftily. \"The door will\nbe open for you whenever you wish to walk through it.\" Rachel believed\nthat, just as she had believed gruff Lorenzo Celino when he told her\nshe did not have to go to Tilia's house. But she also knew that if she\nhad not come here, or if she chose now to walk out that door, these\npeople would do nothing more for her.\n\nStaying, much as she might hate what would happen to her, was better\nthan wandering alone on the roads of Italy.\n\nShe looked up at the canopy over the bed. It was peach-colored, as were\nthe bed curtains. The walls of the small room were hung with yellow silk\ndrapes framing frescoes showing nude, smiling women fleeing from\ncreatures that were half man and half goat, with things that stuck out\nbefore them like spears.\n\n\"Real men do not have pizzles as big as that,\" Tilia had said when she\nfirst showed Rachel the room, pointing with a grin at a bright red\norgan. \"Although it may look that big to you the first time you see one\nin all its glory.\" Tilia had stopped joking then, and had carefully told\nher exactly what would happen on this night.\n\n_I am better prepared_, Rachel thought, _than many a woman is on her\nwedding night_.\n\nIndeed, her own mother, months before she died, had already explained\nmuch of this to Rachel. But the thought of her mother fairly broke her\nheart now. Her mother would cut her own throat if she could see Rachel\nin this place, about to let a man do this thing to her for money.\n\nHer body shrank with dread.\n\nShe would rather, far rather, be the ignorant bride of a carpenter or a\ntraveling merchant like her poor Angelo, who had been her husband in\nname only, or even the wife of a butcher, than to lie here in this\ngorgeously decorated room and give her most precious gift to a stranger\nwho had bought the right to deflower her.\n\nShe found herself wishing poor old Angelo had asserted his right as her\nhusband so that she could not now let her virginity be defiled.\n\n_Thank God Angelo is not alive to see this! But if he had lived, I would\nnot be doing this._\n\n_God will never forgive me._\n\n_But if God does not want me to do what I am doing, why did He let this\nhappen to me?_\n\nTilia sat beside the bed in a big chair with a curved bottom. The\njeweled cross she wore--which reminded Rachel that she was among\nChristians here and therefore not safe--rested on her bosom, half\ncovered by the gold lace bordering the neckline of her gown. The cross\nquivered minutely with Tilia's heartbeat.\n\n\"You are probably wondering, child, whether you are doing the right\nthing.\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Rachel was so choked with fear that she could only whisper the\nword.\n\n\"Well, I can tell you there are thousands of women who would give\nanything to be in your place.\"\n\n\"In my place? To become a putana?\"\n\nTilia laughed. \"You think most women are contentedly married, with\nhusbands to take care of them, with children who love them and neighbors\nwho respect them--while only a few like me and the women who work for me\nare putane, whom the rest look down on. Well, listen to me, little one,\nother women _envy_ us. A married woman sells herself, body and soul, to\nbe some man's slave for life. And she gets damned little in return. We\nrent out this little part of our anatomy\"--she patted her lap--\"for a\nmoment, and we keep the profit for ourselves. If we are clever, as I\nhave been, we learn how to keep and increase our money. So when we no\nlonger have youth and beauty to sell, we can take care of ourselves. And\nI tell you that a woman in her later years is likely to be a better\nfriend to herself than any husband.\"\n\n_She speaks with conviction. But I cannot trust her, either. I have not\nhad a true friend in this world since Angelo was killed._\n\nRachel sighed. \"It is just that after tonight there is no turning back.\nThis is for the rest of my life.\"\n\n\"That is right,\" said Tilia. \"You will give up something that you can\nlose only once. When you have a commodity as unique as that, my child,\nyou owe it to yourself to get the most you can for it.\" Her eyes\nhardened. \"Every man wants to be the first to pierce a woman and hear\nher cry out and make her bleed. But what woman gets anything worth\nhaving in return? She gives it away on a dark night to some furfante\nwith a smooth tongue and a handsome leg, or else the tonto she married\ntakes it from her and then tells her to go wash the bed linen.\" She\nturned to stare at Rachel. \"Do you know what I got for my virginity?\"\nHer cheeks were red with anger.\n\n\"What did you get, Signora?\" The heat with which Tilia spoke reassured\nRachel. This was what the woman really felt. She was not just talking to\nlead Rachel astray.\n\n\"Blows and slavery.\" Tilia thrust her face close to Rachel's to\nunderline her words. \"Blows and slavery. The Genoese, may leprosy devour\ntheir limbs and may their prickles fall off in their hands, raided\nOtranto. They raped me--that was how I lost _my_ virginity. They sold me\nto the Turks.\"\n\n\"You were a slave to the Turks?\" Rachel gasped. \"Where?\" And how did she\nescape them and come to Orvieto and grow so rich and fat?\n\nTilia looked away. \"Never mind. It would take too long to tell you.\"\nRachel sensed that there was something here Tilia did not want to talk\nabout. But she resolved to pry the story out of her one day.\n\nTilia's head swung back to face her. \"Have I told you what you are\ngetting this night for giving this man this proud moment of possessing a\nvirgin?\"\n\n\"I--I do not remember.\" Tilia had named a figure, but it had been so\noutrageous and Rachel had been so frightened by the prospect that she\nhad promptly forgotten it.\n\n\"By the five wounds of Jesus, you truly are a child, not to remember\nsomething so important! Well, fix it in your mind this time, and think\nof it when you are wondering whether you are doing right. Five hundred\ngolden florins. Five hundred, newly minted in Florence. That is your\nshare. That is half of what he is paying. The other half is mine, as is\nonly just. Think of it. He pays the price of a palazzo for you because\nyou are a very young, beautiful virgin, and that is what he most\ndesperately desires. Compare that with what most women get when they let\na man have them for the first time.\"\n\n_That is far more money than Angelo ever saw in his whole life. Who is\nthis man who will pay so much to have me?_ Rachel supposed Tilia would\ntell her who the man was if she asked, but she had decided it was better\nnot to know anything about him ahead of time. That way she could imagine\nthat he would be someone kind and gentle.\n\n\"I do not know what I will do with all that money,\" Rachel said softly.\n\n_If I lose it, all this will have been for nothing._\n\nTilia's wide mouth stretched even wider in a grin. \"I will show you how\nto plant it.\"\n\n\"Plant it?\"\n\n\"Yes, and then watch it grow. There are many, many fields in which to\nplant money. You can place it with the Templars or certain Lombards or\nmen I know among your own Jews, and they use it, and when they give it\nback to you there is more. Miracolo! Or you can buy beautiful and\nvaluable things with it, whose worth increases as they get older. Or you\ncan buy shares in a ship of Venice or Pisa, or even\"--she spat--\"Genoa,\nor a German caravan, and when the caravan or the ship comes back, if it\ncomes back, you get your money back tenfold. That is risky, but it is\nthe quickest way to great wealth.\"\n\nRachel felt a momentary excitement. Then she remembered how she was\ngoing to get the money. Her body felt colder than ever, cold as death.\nThis, she thought, must be the way that poor man they killed last week\nfelt when he was waiting for the torturers to come for him. She\nshuddered and hugged her knees tight against her chest under the gauzy\ngown Tilia had given her to wear.\n\nTilia must have seen the sudden darkening of her mood. She moved over to\nthe bed and sat down beside Rachel, making the frame of the bed groan\nalarmingly. She put a hand lightly on Rachel's arm.\n\n\"Listen, Rachel. I was raped. I will not be party to the rape of\nanother. You do not have to do this. Just tell me that you do not want\nto.\"\n\nA sudden heat rushed through Rachel's body. She was no longer cold. She\nburned with anger.\n\n\"Stop saying that!\" she screamed. \"Will you leave me alone?\" Being\nreminded over and over again that she was doing this of her own free\nwill was an even worse torture than imagining what the man would do to\nher.\n\n_Oh, God, I am going to cry and make myself ugly, and he will not want\nme and I will not get the five hundred florins._\n\nShe pressed her hands against her face, trying to stop tears.\n\n\"I was asking you to think, not carry on,\" said Tilia reprovingly. \"If\nyou want to walk well in life, you had better learn not to burst into\ntears when you have an important decision to make.\"\n\nRachel took deep breaths to calm herself.\n\n\"I decided days ago that I could not do any better for myself than this,\nSignora Tilia. But I am so afraid. Perhaps the man will not want me when\nhe sees how afraid I am.\"\n\nTilia grinned broadly. \"Nonsense. The more innocent and timid you\nappear, the more you will delight him.\"\n\nRachel heard a light tapping at the door, and her heart beat so hard she\nthought it would burst.\n\nTilia rose, brushing down her green satin gown. \"The signal that he has\narrived. I thought he would never get here. It's almost morning. I must\ngo down and greet him, child. But remember, I will be watching\neverything.\"\n\n_I do not really like that._\n\nTilia winked and pushed on what looked like a plaster panel between two\ngold-painted beams in the wall. It swung away from her and she squeezed\nthrough.\n\nRachel sat in the bed, drawn up into the corner of it that was farthest\nfrom the door, and waited. She played nervously with fingers that felt\nlike icicles.\n\nA short time later she caught a glimpse of Tilia pushing open the door,\nbut her eyes fixed on the man standing in the doorway.\n\nShe drew in a deep, gasping breath. She wanted to scream.\n\nThe man standing in the doorway was short and broad. He wore a long,\nbrightly colored silk robe. His skin was brown, his eyes little black\nslits. A white mustache drooped below his flat nose. A thin white beard\nlike a goat's hung from his chin.\n\nShe had seen this man once before, when she watched from the window of\nSophia's room at Cardinal Ugolini's, the day he arrived in Orvieto in a\ngreat procession.\n\nRachel's breath, so long held, burst out of her in a moan.\n\nThe man who had come to take her virginity was a Tartar.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"It was as much by my choice as the cardinal's that I did not attend the\ncontessa's reception,\" said Friar Mathieu, yawning. \"How could a Little\nBrother of San Francesco stay up till all hours with people stuffing\nthemselves with rich food and drinking wine? And gambling, and kissing\neach other in dark corners?\"\n\nThe old Franciscan's eyes were watery with sleepiness, but the corners\nof his mouth quirked with humor under his white mustache. He sat on the\nedge of the cot, which, as he had insisted when he moved into the\nPalazzo Monaldeschi, was the only piece of furniture in the room. Simon\npaced the floor, unable to stand still.\n\nSimon felt the barb in the mention of kissing, but he did not mind it.\nWhen he routed Friar Mathieu out of his narrow bed in a remote corner of\nthe palace, he admitted at once that he had been in the atrium with\nUgolini's niece, Sophia, while David of Trebizond was so disastrously\nbaiting the Tartars.\n\n\"I was wrong to pay court to the cardinal's niece.\" He could still feel\nher lips under his, still taste them, and his body tingled at the\nremembrance. \"I am as much at fault as de Verceuil. But it was he who\nfound that ignorant woman to replace you as interpreter, and then he\nwent off to gamble--with David's servant, of all people--and left the\nTartars alone and unprotected.\"\n\nFriar Mathieu shook his head. \"Yes, and drinking that wine of\nMontefiascone. I wonder why God chose to make those particular grapes so\nirresistible.\"\n\nSimon pounded his fist into his palm. \"We must confront de Verceuil,\nFriar Mathieu.\"\n\nA deep crease appeared between the thick white eyebrows. \"At this hour?\"\n\nSimon saw the fatigue in Mathieu's wrinkled face and felt guilty. \"I am\nmost heartily sorry for awakening you at this ungodly time of night. It\nwas just--\"\n\n\"Just that you could not sleep yourself.\" The friar laughed. \"But it is\na most Godly time of night. The fact is, I would have had to get up soon\nto say the first part of my office. Were I living with my brother\nFranciscans--as I wish I were--I would be up chanting lauds with them.\nBut I fear the cardinal will be neither willing nor able to talk to us\nif we go to him now.\"\n\n\"So much damage has been done, Friar Mathieu. The contessa is furious. I\ncould not begin to reason with her. She went on and on, talking about\nmurderers of babies. I would not be surprised if tomorrow morning she\nordered us to leave her palazzo.\"\n\nThe old man raised a hand. \"Pope Urban would not let her do that. It\nwould be an insult to the ambassadors.\"\n\n\"Cardinal le Gros told me the pope looked pale and shaken when he left.\nHe might not care whether the ambassadors are insulted. We can have no\nmore of de Verceuil's blundering.\"\n\n_Or mine._\n\nFriar Mathieu shook a finger at him. \"What happened tonight is not the\ncardinal's doing. None of this is accidental. What happened tonight\nshows that Ugolini will do everything in his power to block this\nalliance.\"\n\n\"But Ugolini did nothing tonight. It was all that man from Trebizond.\"\n\n\"That is like saying that the axe chops the tree down, and not the\nwoodsman wielding it. Ugolini brought David to the contessa's reception.\nHe brought David's servant, an accomplished gambler as well as a\nrecruiter of brigosi. And he brought his niece, Sophia.\"\n\nAt the mention of Sophia a sharp pain went through Simon's chest.\n\n_Sophia cannot be part of it. Not when I have just found her._\n\nWas it possible that the passion she had showed in their time together\nin the atrium was a sham? That would be too cruel. And yet, how could he\nprove that she was innocent?\n\n\"It is just a coincidence that Sophia is here in Orvieto now,\" he said.\n\"She is as undecided about this matter of the Tartars as the pope\nhimself is.\"\n\n_But is the pope still undecided_, Simon wondered as he spoke.\n\nThe wrinkles around Friar Mathieu's faded blue eyes deepened a little.\n\"Well, I would not expect you to say otherwise. A knight does not doubt\nthe honor of a lady he has kissed.\"\n\nSimon sensed Friar Mathieu's skepticism, but he could not bring himself\nto believe that Sophia had knowingly been the cardinal's agent. This\nwoman had made Italy a place of enchantment for him.\n\nFriar Mathieu went on. \"We both agree, do we not, that the luring of\nCardinal de Verceuil by David's man, Giancarlo, was planned by Ugolini?\"\n\nGlad to be on safer ground, Simon nodded vigorously. \"We agree on that,\nto be sure.\"\n\n\"But we cannot simply go to de Verceuil, as you proposed, and denounce\nhim for having left the room with Giancarlo. Not when he can at once\npoint out that you also left the room--with Sophia.\"\n\nSimon turned his back on Friar Mathieu and stared out, almost unseeing,\ntoward the window. It had neither glass nor shutters nor parchment, only\na gauze curtain to discourage insects, iron bars to keep out larger\nintruders. He felt furious with himself.\n\nThe mention of Giancarlo reminded him that he had heard nothing from\nSordello. By now the old mercenary should have insinuated himself into\nthe band Giancarlo was gathering. Perhaps through Sordello Simon could\nprove Sophia's innocence.\n\nHe noticed now that some light was coming through the curtain, and he\nthought he heard birds singing. He had been up all night.\n\n\"Then you think it pointless for us to confront de Verceuil? I suppose\nyou do not think I should write to Count Charles, either.\"\n\n\"I think it very unlikely that Count Charles would give the cardinal's\nresponsibilities in this to someone else. I think it very likely that\nCardinal de Verceuil has his intriguers around the count who would learn\nof your message and might set themselves to do you harm. No, I do not\nthink we can rid ourselves of the cardinal. But I agree that we should\nmeet with him.\"\n\nSimon was bewildered. \"To do what?\"\n\nFriar Mathieu shrugged. \"No man is beyond redemption. He must realize\nthat because of his blundering tonight--our blundering--the mission is\nperilously close to failing. Perhaps we can convince him that in the\nfuture we must work together. Otherwise there will be no glory for him\nto steal from us.\"\n\nThe old friar had been sleeping only in a robe of gray frieze. He pulled\na sleeveless brown mantle over his head and tied a white cord around his\nwaist, and he was dressed for the day. Simon envied him the simplicity\nof his apparel. It took him a good deal longer to dress himself in the\nmorning, and he knew noblemen who spent hours in their wardrobes, with\nservants to help them, before they felt ready to face the world.\n\n\"We will go now, then?\" he asked.\n\n\"Well, you are up. If the cardinal is as upset about this disaster as\nyou are, he may well have spent a sleepless night, too. Let us go and\nsee.\"\n\nThey walked side by side down dim corridors cluttered with battered old\nchairs and tables, past walls covered with tattered hangings, dented\nshields, and rusty coats of mail. The Monaldeschi family, it seemed,\nnever threw away anything. The rooms set aside for the cardinal and his\nentourage were on the third floor of the palazzo, where the windows were\nlarger and set with white glass. A man wrapped in a blanket lay on a\nsack of straw outside the door to the cardinal's rooms. The top of his\nhead, shaved in a tonsure, gleamed dully in the light of the one fat\ncandle that illuminated the corridor. A cleric in minor orders, no\ndoubt. Simon shook him.\n\n\"No, Your Signory,\" the cleric said, yawning and stretching as he stood\nup to bow properly to the count. \"The cardinal is not sleeping, but\nneither is he here. After the contessa's reception he and the Tartars\nand their guards all went out. His Eminence did not choose to tell me\nwhere they were bound.\"\n\nSimon felt the wind knocked out of him, as if he had been running full\ntilt and tripped. He looked at Friar Mathieu, who wore a pained, even\nsad expression.\n\nAfter everything else that had gone wrong, how could de Verceuil take\nthe Tartars into the streets late at night? They might run afoul of\nbravos or some of the wild young men of Orvieto's feuding families. Why\nwould de Verceuil take such a risk?\n\nThen Simon understood the reason for Friar Mathieu's look of sadness.\nMen would leave the Palazzo Monaldeschi at this hour for only one\nreason--loose women.\n\nSimon had heard that in the darkest hours a corrupt, secret world\nglowed brightly in Orvieto, hidden behind discreet walls. Rumor told of\nhigh-ranking churchmen who ventured behind those walls; indeed, it was\nsaid that the secret world existed because of the patronage of such men.\nOf course de Verceuil would be a patron of that sinful night world. And\nof course he would draw the Tartars into it. Barbarians that they were,\nthey no doubt expected the attentions of harlots as their due.\n\n_That I am surprised only proves, I suppose, what a bumpkin I am_,\nthought Simon, annoyed at himself and disgusted with de Verceuil.\n\nHe must pray, he thought with a chill, that the Tartars' guards were\nwell armed and alert.\n\n\n\n\nXXV\n\n\nSwords drawn, Daoud and Lorenzo stood back-to-back in the shadowy\ncourtyard. Lorenzo faced the six men who had emerged from the end of the\nalley and were now fanning out to surround them. Daoud confronted the\nfour who had jumped down into the campiello.\n\nA shutter opened on the overhanging second floor of a house, and Daoud\nglanced up to see a face. The shutter slammed with a finality that\ndeclared the householder wanted nothing to do with what was going on\nbelow.\n\nIt was too dark to see the faces of the men before him. They wore dark\ncapes, and two of them carried long daggers in one hand and swords in\nthe other. One shadowy figure stepped forward now, and Daoud wondered if\nthey were going to challenge him.\n\n\"Messere, let us speak quickly. You are David of Trebizond, are you\nnot?\"\n\nThe man had asked the question in an urgent but respectful tone.\n\nFeeling a bit more hopeful, Daoud answered, \"Yes, I am David.\"\n\n\"Who the devil are _you_?\" called a voice from behind Daoud.\n\nThe man addressed his answer to Daoud. \"I am Andrea Sordello of Rimini,\nMesser David. These three men are my comrades. It would honor us if you\nwould accept our service.\"\n\n\"Accept his service,\" Lorenzo said at once from behind Daoud. \"We have\nnothing to lose.\"\n\nDaoud made himself decide at once. \"If you are willing to help me, I am\ngrateful.\"\n\n\"Be off with you, Messer Sordello,\" called one of the original pursuers.\n\"This is no quarrel of yours.\"\n\n\"And what is _your_ quarrel with these men?\" Sordello replied.\n\n\"That is no affair of yours, Messere!\" It was the voice of a very young\nman, intense, passionate.\n\nDaoud turned to face the young voice. At once Sordello moved to take a\nposition at his side.\n\nDaoud realized that he could see better; the first hint of dawn. And not\nonly was there more light, but his head was clearer as well. The heat of\nhis body, aroused to fight, was burning away the intoxicating spirits in\nhis blood.\n\nThe men opposite were spread far apart. The one who spoke for them was\nslender and wore a cap that fell over one ear. A silver badge glittered\non the cap.\n\nSordello spoke again. \"Since you will not say, Messere, I will tell\n_you_ what your affair is. You are of the famiglia Filippeschi. You saw\nthese gentlemen leaving the Palazzo Monaldeschi and decided that any\nguest of the Monaldeschi must be an enemy of yours. And so you decided\nto hunt down and kill these good gentlemen, who have done you no harm\nand are not even citizens of Orvieto, for the offense of having enjoyed\nthe hospitality of your rivals.\"\n\nFilippeschi. Daoud had been wanting to make contact with them ever since\nhis arrival in Orvieto. Now he had met them, and--accursed luck--they\nwanted to kill him.\n\n\"Lorenzo, they are Filippeschi,\" he muttered. \"Talk to them.\"\n\n\"There is no talking to _them_, Messer David,\" said Sordello. \"They are\nout for your blood.\"\n\n\"Be still,\" said Daoud. The man had offered his services. Let him\nconfine himself to serving, then.\n\nLorenzo stepped out in front of Daoud, his sword still out before him,\nbut angled toward the ground.\n\n\"Messeres, at least you should know who it is that you have set out to\nkill. I am Giancarlo of Naples, and this is my master, David. He is a\nmerchant from Trebizond, which is very far away. Much too far for him\nto have any connection with the quarrels of Orvieto.\"\n\nOne of the Filippeschi bravos, a short man standing to the left of the\nslender leader, said, \"You spin a tale to try to fool us. Anyone can see\nyour master is a Frenchman. Too many damned French in Italy. The\nMonaldeschi are toadies of the French. Death to the Monaldeschi, and\ndeath to the French!\"\n\nWhat a bitter fate it would be, Daoud thought, if his Frankish looks,\nwhich caused him to be sent here, earned him his death in a stupid\nstreet fight.\n\n\"There are six of you,\" said Lorenzo. \"But now that these four men have\njoined us, there are six of us. Bad odds for you, because no matter how\nmuch you harm us, you will certainly come out of this quarrel worse off\nthan you went into it.\" Lowering his sword even more, he stepped closer\nto the young man with the silver badge on his cap. \"Signore. Which of\nthese men are you willing to lose, to pay for the privilege of hurting\nus?\" With his free hand he pointed from man to man in the circle of six.\n\"That man? That one? That one? Yourself?\"\n\n\"We will start with you!\" the short man shouted.\n\nHe lunged at Lorenzo, his sword thrusting straight for Lorenzo's chest.\n\nLorenzo's sword was up in an instant, parrying the short man's attack.\nAt the same moment, out of the corner of his eye Daoud saw Sordello's\narm flash up, then down.\n\nThe short man gave a cry and stumbled. He staggered a few steps, then\ncollapsed in a heap at the feet of one of the other Filippeschi bravos.\n\nLorenzo stepped back so that he and Sordello flanked Daoud. Sordello's\nthree men moved up beside them, one to the left, two to the right.\n\n\"You may see to the man who is hurt,\" said Lorenzo. \"Unless you want to\ncontinue.\"\n\n\"If he is only hurt, I should retire to a monastery.\" Sordello laughed.\nIndeed, Daoud saw that the man on the ground was not moving.\n\n_I do not like this Sordello_, Daoud thought. _He comes out of nowhere\nwanting to work for me. He kills in haste and boasts about it._\n\nThe young man with the silver badge on his cap knelt by the fallen\nbravo and felt under his cape. \"Morte,\" he said harshly, and stood\nagain.\n\n\"Well, Messeres,\" said Lorenzo, \"we are now six to five. We did not\nchoose to quarrel. We still do not wish to fight. In fact, we ourselves\nare at odds with the Monaldeschi.\"\n\n\"How might that be?\" said the young man.\n\n\"Are we done fighting? I wish to make a proposal to you.\"\n\nThe Filippeschi spokesman glanced at his fellows. \"What say you?\"\n\n\"Alfredo was my cousin,\" said a tall bravo in a rust-colored cape. \"But\nI cannot avenge him alone.\"\n\n\"Alfredo was impetuous,\" said the young man. \"He acted before I gave an\norder.\"\n\n\"You are no leader, Marco, if you will not undertake the vendetta for\none of your men.\"\n\n_The vendetta. These Italians are like the desert tribesmen. Kill one of\nthem, and you have his family to deal with._\n\n\"I will show you what kind of a leader I am if you speak that way to me\nagain,\" said Marco.\n\n\"Enough, enough,\" said one of the other bravos, and the man in the\nrust-colored cape shrugged.\n\nIt was now almost daylight, and Daoud studied the face of the young man\ncalled Marco. He could not be more than seventeen, Daoud thought,\nlooking at his smooth cheeks and downy black mustache.\n\n_Marco!_ He had heard that the head of the Filippeschi family was a\nyoung Conte Marco di Filippeschi.\n\n\"What do you propose, Messere?\" said Marco.\n\n\"Meet me in front of the Church of Sant' Agnes,\" Lorenzo said. \"This\nevening at Compline. Come alone, as I will. There are things we can\ndiscuss, I think, to our mutual profit.\"\n\nMarco bowed to Lorenzo. \"I shall expect you, Messere.\" He gestured, and\nthe man in the reddish cape and one other picked up the body of Alfredo.\n\n\"Momento, Messeres,\" said Sordello, moving to the body in three quick\nstrides. He bent down, reached under the body, and with a jerk of his\nhand pulled free a long, thin throwing knife, which he wiped on his\ncape.\n\n\"I can ill afford to lose so well-balanced a knife as this.\"\n\nAlfredo's cousin, holding the body by the shoulders, said, \"I know your\nname, Andrea Sordello, and your face. You will not need that knife much\nlonger.\"\n\nSordello made a mock bow. \"Be assured, Messere, this knife will not miss\n_you_, if we should meet again.\"\n\nA moment later the Filippeschi and their burden had disappeared into the\nalley.\n\nDaoud studied the dark irregular stain where the fallen man had bled on\nthe rain-damp paving stones of the campiello. It was dawn, already past\nFajr, the time for morning prayer.\n\n_God is great. In the name of God, the Beneficent, the Merciful. All\npraise be to God, Lord of the Worlds._\n\n\"I advise you not to have any dealings with the Filippeschi, Messeres,\"\nSordello said suddenly. \"They'll betray you.\"\n\nEven though he had given no outward sign that he was praying, Daoud was\nangered at being interrupted. He eyed Sordello. The man was shorter than\nhe, about fifty years of age, Daoud judged. His hair was a good deal\ngrayer than Lorenzo's, and it hung lankly down to his jawline under a\nshabby maroon cap. The bones of Sordello's nose and brows were thickened\nand flattened, as if they had been broken many times. It was the face of\nan old fighter, the sort of face that usually commanded Daoud's respect,\nbe it borne by Christian or Muslim. But when Daoud looked at him,\nSordello stared back fixedly, unnaturally, as if it were an effort to\nlook Daoud in the eye.\n\n\"Was your advice asked, Messere?\" Lorenzo growled.\n\n_He feels about the man as I do_, Daoud thought. Now, Daoud thought,\nSordello would bluster about saving their lives, and he would ask for\nemployment.\n\n\"Forgive me,\" Sordello said. \"I presumed too much.\" He pulled off his\ncap and bowed to the surprised Daoud. Either he was a better man than he\nseemed at first glance, or he was much more devious.\n\n\"Forgive _us_,\" Daoud said, bowing back, though not as deeply, and\ndrawing a disapproving grunt from Lorenzo. \"We owe you our deepest\ngratitude. How came you leaping down from the housetops when we needed\nhelp so badly?\"\n\n\"I have been looking for a chance to meet Messer Giancarlo. Tonight I\nwaited outside the Monaldeschi palace, hoping that you would emerge from\nthe reception in a good mood. While I and my fellows were hanging about\nthe palace, we chanced to see those brigosi lurking in the shadows\nnearby. When you came out, it was you they chose to follow, so we\nfollowed them. When you went down this alley, we took to the rooftops,\nthe better to surprise your enemies.\"\n\n\"Why were you looking for me?\" Lorenzo asked gruffly.\n\n\"I heard that you pay well for men who are adept with sword and dagger\nand who ask no questions about what they might be hired for.\"\n\n\"I also like a man who does not talk much,\" said Lorenzo. \"You talk a\ngreat deal.\"\n\n\"Yes, Messer Giancarlo.\" Sordello lowered his eyes. Again, that\ndisarming humility.\n\nThe man was resourceful and quick-thinking. He was arrogant one moment,\nhumble the next.\n\n\"How did you come to Orvieto, Sordello?\" Daoud asked him.\n\n\"I served Sigismundo Malatesta, governor of Rimini, until his death,\"\nsaid Sordello. \"Since then I have not found a suitable master. I was\ntraveling south, thinking perhaps of offering my sword to King Manfred,\nwhen I heard of you, Messer Giancarlo, while passing through Viterbo.\"\n\nDaoud felt uneasy, hearing that Lorenzo's recruiting expeditions were\nbeing gossiped of in the cities around here. And how easily Sordello had\nbeen able to make the connection between Giancarlo and David of\nTrebizond. Just as Tilia had said, it was impossible to hire men without\nattracting attention.\n\nHe realized Lorenzo was waiting for him to speak.\n\n\"You may walk with us to Cardinal Ugolini's mansion,\" Daoud said.\n\nWhen they emerged from the alley, there was no sign of the Filippeschi.\nTwo of Sordello's men walked in front of Daoud and Lorenzo, and Sordello\nand the other man followed behind them. The wine had worn off\naltogether, but Daoud felt a throbbing pain behind his eyes and a great\nneed to sleep.\n\n\"Well?\" Lorenzo said, keeping his voice low. \"The man wants us to hire\nhim.\"\n\n\"We need more men, and we want clever street fighters,\" said Daoud. \"He\nis that.\"\n\n\"Yes, but he is the type of man I detest,\" said Lorenzo. \"I did not need\nhim to kill that Filippeschi bravo for me. He acts before he thinks.\"\n\n\"After tonight we may not have to attack the French directly,\" Daoud\nsaid. \"On the other hand, we are sure to have further need of\nbodyguards, and I think Sordello and his three companions would suit.\nLet us give ourselves time to think. Tell him you will meet him and give\nhim our answer in two days.\"\n\n\n\n\nXXVI\n\n\nIt could not be worse, Rachel thought. She could not be more degraded.\nAn old man, and a Tartar. Were the Tartars even human, she wondered, or\nwas she about to commit the further abominable sin of mating with an\nanimal?\n\nThe door had closed behind him with a terribly final sound, and he was\nstanding in front of it, showing his teeth, large and strong and very\nwhite, in a broad grin.\n\nShe wondered if he could see her knees and hands trembling. If only she\nhad accepted Signora Tilia's offer to release her from this. Was it too\nlate? Could she rush past the Tartar to the door and pull it open and\nrun away? If she did that now, doubtless the Tartar would be insulted.\nFrom what she knew about these creatures, it would be very dangerous to\nmake him angry.\n\n_I will pretend to be sick. When he is not looking, I will stick my\nfinger down my throat and throw up. That will disgust him so, he will\nleave me alone._\n\nOr it might antagonize him enough to kill her. Her body broke out in a\ncold sweat. Her eyes were shut, but she heard the monster coming closer.\nShe thought of what he would do to her, and her stomach heaved--she\nwould throw up even without trying to. She hoped he _would_ kill her.\nBetter that than his animal's thing inside her.\n\nShe opened her eyes, to see that he had stopped halfway between the\nclosed door and the bed.\n\nActually, he was not so hideous. He had a round brown face and bright\nblack eyes, and his beard was white, as Angelo's had been.\n\n_Ah, Rachel, Rachel, the joy of my old age_, Angelo would say. _My beard\nwas white before you were born._\n\n_He would not rejoice in his old age if he could see me now._\n\nThe Tartar's beard and mustache were not full and flowing, as Angelo's\nhad been, but stringy. The beard almost seemed like a false beard,\npasted on that small, sharp chin.\n\nHe said, \"Buona sera, berra feeria.\" He had learned some Italian. But it\nwas not evening. It was almost morning. And what was he trying to\nsay--\"bella figlia?\" Beautiful daughter? He had probably asked someone\nwhat he should say, and they had told him the wrong things.\n\n\"Buona sera, Mio Signore,\" she answered, inclining her head slightly.\nHer voice was a terrified whisper. When she heard how frightened she\nsounded, she became more frightened still and huddled into the farthest\ncorner of the bed, wishing she could squeeze through a crack in the wall\nbeside her and disappear.\n\nThe Tartar tapped his chest, smiling and nodding. \"John.\" He wore a\ncrimson silk tunic that fell to his knees, and over it a pale green\ngown, open in front, with wide sleeves. When she had stood by a window\nin the cardinal's palazzo and watched the Tartars' arrival in Orvieto,\nhe and the other Tartar had worn foreign-looking silk robes, blood red,\ncovered with blue birds with long golden tails. Now he was dressed like\nan Italian.\n\nHe was still nodding at her, with a questioning look on his face. He\nwanted her to say her name.\n\n\"Rachel,\" she said, touching her chest. How small her breasts were, she\nthought. He could not possibly want a girl with such small breasts. He\ncertainly would not want to devour them. She felt sick to her stomach\nagain.\n\n\"Reicho. Buona sera, Reicho.\" He could not pronounce the letter _l_.\n\n\"Buona sera, John,\" she answered. She was about to smile, but she\nchecked herself. If she seemed to be encouraging him, he would come at\nher. Cold sweat broke out over her skin.\n\n_He is going to come at me anyway._\n\nA silver pitcher of wine with two silver goblets stood on a small\nmarble-topped table beside the bed. Wine might make this easier for her.\nExcept that too much wine would make her sick. Well, was that not what\nshe wanted? She stretched a trembling hand toward it.\n\n\"Will you take some wine, Messer John?\" _Where on earth did he get a\nname like John?_\n\nShe poured the wine, carefully filling the goblets only two-thirds full\nso her trembling hands would not spill their contents.\n\nThe Tartar crossed the room and sat in the round-bottomed chair Tilia\nhad occupied a short while earlier. Rachel held out a goblet to him, and\nher hand shook so badly she almost dropped it. He did not seem to\nnotice. Maybe he was used to being waited on by trembling women. He\nsmiled and nodded.\n\nTilia was watching all this, Rachel remembered. She drained her cup\nquickly, the silver giving the wine a slightly metallic taste. She\npoured a second cup for herself, and looked at him. He barely sipped\nfrom his goblet before setting it on the table, holding his hand palm\ndown over it. Too bad, she thought. She had heard that men who drank too\nmuch could not get stiff enough to go into women.\n\nJohn started talking to her in his own tongue. He spoke for a long time\nwith many gestures, some toward himself, some toward her. She tried\ndesperately to guess what he was saying. She did not want to respond the\nwrong way and anger him.\n\nHe seemed quite at ease, and he laughed occasionally, as if he were\ntelling her funny stories that amused him as well. She saw webs of fine\nwrinkles in the brown skin around his eyes and thought, _He could be\nolder than Angelo_.\n\nHe began to make a strange sound, a long-drawn-out moan. Perhaps he was\nin pain. Perhaps _he_ was going to be sick. Her heart leapt hopefully.\nThen the moan changed pitch, and his mouth began to shape words. They\nmust be Tartar words. He was singing to her. It was unmistakably a song,\nbut it was strange and shrill to her ears. She almost burst out\nlaughing, but immediately felt terror at the thought of offending him.\n\nIt began to dawn on her, though, that John was not behaving like a\nbrute, as she had feared he would when she first saw him in the doorway.\nIf she looked behind the black slits that were his eyes, under the\ntanned-leather skin, he seemed a pleasant old man. His language might be\ngibberish to her, but it was clear that he was trying to entertain her,\neven woo her.\n\nBut she hated the thought of what he was trying to woo her _for_.\n\nHe ended his song by clapping his hands rhythmically--she counted nine\nhandclaps. He followed that with more eager smiles and nods. He actually\nwanted to know whether she liked his song. She relaxed a bit.\n\nShe smiled and nodded back. \"Yes. Very good, John. Che bello!\" Perhaps\nshe could get him to sing more, and put off the moment she dreaded.\n\nBut he stood up with a look on his face that froze her heart in her\nchest. There was nothing ferocious or cruel in it or even lustful. There\nwas neither kindness nor pity in it, nor anything that recognized her as\na person. It was the satisfied smile of a man looking upon a possession.\n\nHe slipped off the wide-sleeved gown and unbuckled his belt. She began\nto tremble uncontrollably.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDaoud sat slumped with exhaustion on the carpeted floor of Ugolini's\ncabinet. The long night just past had drained him of all his energy. He\nwanted to sleep, but first he must see to it that Ugolini made good use\nof the advantage they had gained at the contessa's reception.\n\nA strong, rich, familiar smell filtered into his nostrils, and his head\nlifted, as if a powerful hand had gripped it. The door opened, and a\nservant carried in a tray laden with six small porcelain cups, one each\nfor Ugolini, Daoud, Sophia, and Lorenzo and two extra, as well as two\npitchers. Ugolini pushed aside a pile of parchment on his work table,\nand the servant set the tray down.\n\nAs the door closed behind the servant, Daoud drew a deep breath to\nidentify the smell and felt a glow of surprised pleasure.\n\n\"Is it possible?\" he said to Ugolini. \"You have found kaviyeh?\"\n\nUgolini, sitting in the big chair behind his work table, just his head\nand shoulders showing, smiled benignly. \"You may hate the Tartars for\ninvading the Islamic lands, my friend, but it means that we Christians\ncan now trade with that part of the world. The Venetians have been\nimporting the beans from the uplands of Persia in small--and very\nexpensive--quantities. I was saving this for a special occasion. This\nmorning, after your triumph over the Tartars and your narrow escape from\ndeath, seemed appropriate.\"\n\nDaoud found the strength to stand up and pour the steaming black liquid\nfrom the pitcher into a cup. He held the cup to his face with both hands\nand sniffed deeply. He felt happier than he had in a long time.\n\nSophia, sitting on a padded bench against the wall opposite Ugolini's\ntable, said, \"What is that?\" Daoud heard shrill alarm in her voice.\n\nShe must suspect it was some sort of drug, thought Daoud with\namusement.\n\nThe cardinal chuckled amiably. \"Only a beverage, my dear. Long used in\nthe Orient by sages and poets. It produces a heightened state of\nalertness and vigor.\"\n\nDaoud sipped the hot liquid. The taste was wondrously bracing after\nmonths of deprivation, but it was not quite strong enough.\n\n\"This is very good, and I am your grateful slave forever,\" he said. \"But\nyou should tell your servants to boil it longer.\"\n\nHaving sensed that Sophia feared his pleasure, he wanted to share it\nwith her that she might see how harmless it was. He went to her and held\nout his cup.\n\n\"Try this. Be careful, the cup is hot.\"\n\nShe took the cup from him, her fingers brushing his. He felt a tingle in\nhis arm. She raised the cup, sniffed suspiciously and grimaced, but took\na small sip.\n\nHe was disappointed to see her mouth pucker. She did not like it. Well,\nhe could not expect her to take to it at once. He had been drinking it\never since he was a child. Even his crusader family had drunk kaviyeh.\n\n\"A very interesting taste,\" she said, handing back the cup. A Byzantine\ncomment, he thought. He heard Lorenzo chuckle.\n\nA pang of jealousy shot through him. He could not expect her to like\nkaviyeh any more than he could expect her to love him. Especially not\nafter she had been alone in the Monaldeschi atrium with that damned\nFrench count.\n\nHis longing for Sophia made his heart ache. If only he could have her\nfor himself, and not be forced to throw her at Simon de Gobignon. But\nshe was no more his than that emerald Baibars had entrusted to him.\n\nResignedly he told himself he must find out what she had accomplished.\n\n\"How did you deal with the Frankish count?\"\n\n\"As you wished me to.\"\n\nHe walked back to the cardinal's table and turned to face her. Her amber\neyes were fixed on him. She must have been watching him cross the room.\n\n\"Does he want to see you again?\" David demanded.\n\nShe shrugged. \"He did when I left him. But by now he and Cardinal de\nVerceuil will have talked together and may well realize my part in what\nwe did to them.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Ugolini, rubbing his hands together. \"There will be no more\nneed for you to pursue Count Simon, my dear, or for Messer Lorenzo to\nplay backgammon with the French cardinal. And no need for our\nillustrious David to risk further verbal jousting with the Tartars.\"\n\nDaoud felt a stab of exasperation. Just as he had feared, Ugolini wanted\nto believe that with last night's triumph over the Tartars, their work\nwas done. Would he be able to persuade the cardinal to realize this was\nonly the beginning of a long struggle--one in which he, Ugolini, must\nplay the chief part?\n\n\"De Verceuil is a clever but sloppy player,\" Lorenzo interjected. \"He\nkept leaving blots less than six points away from me. But I managed to\nlose eighty florins to him. That kept him interested. Once he decided I\nwas not a skillful player, he kept doubling the stakes and pressing me\nto do the same when the choice was mine.\" He went over to Ugolini's work\ntable and poured himself a cup of kaviyeh.\n\nUgolini laughed. \"He must now think his winnings eighty costly florins\nindeed.\" He filled a cup from another pitcher, sprang up, and carried\nthe cup across the room to Sophia.\n\n\"You will enjoy this spiced milk more than the Muslim kaviyeh. It is my\nfavorite morning drink.\"\n\n\"You think it is all over, then, Cardinal?\" Daoud growled. \"I can go\naway and leave you in peace--and richer?\"\n\nFrom the suddenly outraged face Ugolini turned toward him, Daoud thought\nthe cardinal might well be wishing the Filippeschi had finished him off.\n\n\"Was last night not a victory?\" the cardinal asked in a choked voice.\n\n\"Do you know the difference between winning a battle and winning a war?\"\n\n\"What more can the French do?\" said Ugolini.\n\n\"We must talk about that,\" said Daoud. \"Even though, in spite of this\ngood kaviyeh, my body screams for rest.\" He drained the cup, put it\ndown, and stretched his arms. With difficulty he brought his anger under\ncontrol. He must win Ugolini, not turn him into an enemy.\n\nUgolini had sat down in the high-backed chair behind his work table. His\nslender fingers restlessly polished the dome of the skull with the\ndiagram painted on its cranium that lay before him. He looked as gloomy\nas if he were contemplating the day when he himself would be reduced to\nbones. Lorenzo quietly got up and poured himself another cup of kaviyeh.\n\nDaoud turned to Sophia. \"How do you think de Gobignon feels toward\nyou?\" He hated to ask the question. He watched her face closely. What he\nreally wanted to know was how _she_ felt about de Gobignon.\n\nHer eyes were heavy-lidded. Even with Hashishiyya-trained senses, he\ncould not guess what was behind that damnably unrevealing mask.\n\n\"I think I persuaded him that the cardinal's niece neither knows nor\ncares anything about alliances and crusades. I--believe he could come to\nlove me.\"\n\nRage throbbed in his temples. What, in his sheltered existence, could\nthe young count have learned of love?\n\n\"Love you? Unlikely,\" Daoud challenged her.\n\nHe saw with quick regret that he had hurt her feelings. She recoiled as\nif struck.\n\n\"Do you not think me worthy of a nobleman's love?\"\n\nDaoud crossed the room in three quick steps and stood over her. \"Such\npampered creatures as he are not capable of love.\"\n\nThe mask was back. She shrugged.\n\n\"Love or lust, he is drawn to me. Do you mean to make some use of it?\"\n\n\"Send him a note by one of the cardinal's servants asking him to meet\nwith you in a few days' time.\" Daoud turned and walked to the celestial\nglobe beside Ugolini's table and spun it absently as he studied Sophia.\n\"Let him pick the place, so he feels secure.\"\n\nAgain he had a glimpse through the mask. Her eyes widened in fear. She\nthought he meant to kill de Gobignon. That angered him. Did she care so\nmuch for the Frenchman, then, that his possible death made her lose her\ncomposure?\n\nTo Daoud's surprise, Ugolini jumped from his chair and advanced on him,\nshaking his finger and crying, \"All of France will be down on us like an\navalanche if you harm that boy.\"\n\nDaoud checked an impulse to laugh. Ugolini was such a comical figure in\nthe flapping white robe he had donned on returning to his mansion.\n\nTo Daoud, who had lived most of his life among men for whom death was as\ncommon as fear was rare, the little man's tendency to panic seemed\ncontemptible. But, anew, he reminded himself that he needed Ugolini and\nmust treat him with respect.\n\n\"Please, Your Eminence,\" he said. \"If I meant to have de Gobignon\nkilled, I would not involve Sophia. I want her to tell him what we are\nsupposedly doing. I hope to create conflict among the supporters of the\nalliance.\"\n\n\"But Sophia takes a great risk meeting with him,\" said Ugolini. \"What if\nde Gobignon attempts to force the truth out of her?\"\n\nThe thought of de Gobignon laying violent hands on Sophia angered Daoud,\nand he spoke impulsively.\n\n\"_Then_ I will kill him.\"\n\n\"God help us!\" Ugolini went back to his work table and sat down behind\nit, his hands over his face.\n\nAt once Daoud regretted what he had said. But was there no way to\ninstill courage into this man?\n\n\"There is much work for you to do, Cardinal,\" he said. \"You must not\nfalter now.\"\n\n\"Then let there be no more talk of killing,\" said Ugolini fiercely,\ntaking his hands from his face.\n\nDaoud poured himself another cup of kaviyeh and stood looking down at\nUgolini.\n\n\"With so much at stake, surely you know I would not do anything rash.\"\n\n\"You need not think of _doing anything_,\" Ugolini said, a plea in his\neyes. \"As long as the pope delays his decision about the Tartars, your\npeople are safe.\"\n\nTrue enough, Daoud thought. Delay was a large part of his mission. But,\ndespite what Ugolini might think, it was not enough. For the safety of\nIslam, an alliance between Tartars and Christians must be made\nimpossible.\n\n\"Your Eminence, will it please you to visit the cardinals who heard the\nTartars condemn themselves last night?\" He tried not to make it sound\nlike an order.\n\n\"I see no need for that,\" said Ugolini.\n\nOf course, Daoud thought. The little cardinal's mind was so full of fear\nthat he could not see at all.\n\n\"But I am hoping that you can organize a delegation of cardinals to go\nto the pope and urge him to give up the idea of an alliance with the\nTartars. After all, you are the cardinal camerlengo. Your word has\nweight.\"\n\nUgolini made a bridge of his interlaced fingers and rested his forehead\nagainst them, as if his head ached.\n\n\"I have attacked the Tartars at the pope's council.\" He spoke down at\nhis table, barely loud enough for Daoud to hear him. \"I have introduced\nyou into the highest circles in Orvieto. I have let you recruit\ncriminals and instigate riots while you live in my mansion. I hear you\nplotting murder.\" He looked up suddenly, wild-eyed. \"Basta! Enough!\"\n\nDespair made Daoud feel weak. He knew this sick feeling came partly from\nbeing awake all night, poisoning himself with al-koahl, and nearly\ngetting himself murdered. He told himself it did not matter how he felt.\nHe was Sufi-trained, and could control his feelings. He was a Mameluke,\nand must remain on the attack.\n\nBut he chose not to meet Ugolini's refusal directly.\n\n\"I also hope that you will be able to persuade Fra Tomasso d'Aquino to\nwrite an open letter, to the pope or to the King of France, denouncing\nthe Tartars. Copies of the letter can be circulated to men of influence\nthroughout Christendom.\"\n\nUgolini shook his head, whiskers fluttering. \"Fra Tomasso is neutral and\nwants to stay that way.\"\n\n_But if I can, I intend to push Fra Tomasso away from his neutrality._\n\n\"Surely he could not have failed to be moved by what he heard last\nnight,\" said Daoud. \"I could see that he was.\"\n\n\"It will take more than one incident to move Fra Tomasso,\" said Ugolini.\n\n_Now I have him!_ Daoud glanced at Lorenzo, who nodded encouragingly.\n\nDaoud leaned forward, pressing both hands on the table. \"There! You\nyourself have said the very thing I have been trying to tell you. Last\nnight was just one incident. It was not enough to move Fra Tomasso _or_\nthe cardinals _or_ the pope. We must do more. You can accomplish\neverything we want by persuasion and cunning and subterfuge. If you do,\nI will never have to put my hand to my dagger, and you will have nothing\nto fear.\" He shook his open hand at Ugolini. \"Take the lead yourself.\"\n\nUgolini sat staring at the skull while Daoud held his breath.\n\nThe little cardinal pulled at his whiskers and looked up at Daoud. \"What\nmust I do?\"\n\nDaoud let his breath out. Strength surged back into his body, and\ndespair fled before it.\n\n\"Tell me,\" he said, \"if Fra Tomasso were to turn against the Tartars,\nwhat do you think the Franks would do about it?\"\n\nUgolini frowned. \"I think that then the only way to reach him would be\nthrough the Dominicans. If his superiors commanded him to change his\nopinion on the Tartars, or to be silent, he would have to obey.\"\n\n\"And who, of the alliance's chief supporters, would speak to the\nDominican order for the French?\" Daoud pressed.\n\n\"Count Simon lacks the authority,\" Ugolini said. \"Friar Mathieu is\neloquent and knows the Tartars well, but I cannot imagine that the chief\nDominicans would pay any attention to an ordinary Franciscan priest.\"\n\n\"What of de Verceuil?\" Daoud asked.\n\nUgolini nodded. \"As a cardinal, de Verceuil can speak as an equal to the\nhead of the Dominican order.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Daoud. \"That is what I hoped you would tell me.\" He turned\naway from Ugolini. He had accomplished as much as he could for the\nmoment. Exhaustion struck him like a mace on the back of his head.\n\n\"Lorenzo, when you meet that bravo Sordello, tell him that I have\ndecided he and the three with him can join us. I am going to bed.\"\n\n\"I have a bad feeling about him,\" said Lorenzo.\n\nDaoud paused to consider this. It was precisely for such advice that he\nneeded Lorenzo.\n\nHe put his hand on Lorenzo's shoulder. \"If he is spying on us, we need\nto know who sought to place him in our camp. Let him feel he is secure\nwith us. Then start keeping a close watch on him. See to whom he leads\nus.\"\n\nDaoud turned from Lorenzo to look at Sophia. She was looking at him\nintently, but he could not tell what she was thinking or feeling. Tired\nas he was, he wished she would come to bed with him. If only she were\nwilling. If only he could invite her.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRachel lay with her face to the wall, crying silently. She wanted not to\nweep because she was still afraid of offending the Tartar, even though\nit was all over.\n\nShe realized that her gown was still above her waist, and she lifted her\nhips to pull it down. But what was the point of modesty for her anymore?\nEspecially with this man, who had taken her virginity.\n\nShe heard the rustling of silk as he dressed behind her. He had not\ntaken all of his clothes off, just enough to bare his member. It had\nbeen smaller than she imagined. Once, in a stable in Perugia, a boy had\nshown himself to her and tried to rape her, but she had run away. That\nstableboy's thing had been much bigger.\n\nJohn said something to her, but she understood only his \"Reicho.\" He was\nprobably telling her to stop crying.\n\nEven though he had been kindly before getting into the bed with her, she\nhad expected that he would become like the wild, savage Tartars she had\nheard about. His weight on top of her, even though he was a small man,\nhad frightened her, but he had entered her slowly, and stopped and\nwaited when she cried out. In the end it had been she, wanting in\ndesperation to get it over with, who finished the piercing by pressing\nupward with her hips. His few quick thrusts and his shout of pleasure--a\ndrawn-out horseman's yell--followed in a moment. And that was all there\nwas to it.\n\nShe sobbed aloud suddenly and bit into the pillow. The thought that her\nwhole future had been decided by a moment that had not lasted even as\nlong as it takes to light a candle was too much to bear.\n\n_Angelo would say I am not a good woman anymore._\n\nThe Tartar spoke again, and tapped her on the shoulder. His voice was\nsoft and kind. Quieting her sobs with one last, deep, shuddering sigh,\nshe rolled over to look at him. More smiles and nods from him. Yes, he\nwanted to cheer her up. She sensed that he knew something about women,\nand what he knew had come not just from rapes committed on the\nbattlefield. He must have a wife in the faraway land he came from, and\nhe must, long ago, have done to that wife what he had just done to\nRachel. More than one wife, she reminded herself, and more than one\ndeflowering, because according to Tilia, the Tartars took several wives,\nas the Muslims did. He was probably a grandfather many times over back\nin that land.\n\nHe stood beside the bed, fully dressed. He had even tucked back and\nknotted his hair behind his head. His grin broadened when she looked at\nhim. Rachel had not seen a Jewish or a Christian man as old as John with\nsuch good teeth.\n\nHe untied a small bag from his belt. He held it out to her. Should she\ntake it? Of course she should. Was not getting paid the whole point of\nwhat she had just gone through? Was not money what her body was to be\ntraded for from now on?\n\n\"Thank you, Messer John,\" she said, and reached out her hand. But he\ncame closer and rubbed the soft leather of the bag against her cheeks,\nto dry her tears. She understood what he was trying to tell her--that\nthis money should pay her for her pain. Being a pagan, he could not\nunderstand the greater pain of her soul because she had sinned, because\nshe had shamed her family and dishonored herself forever.\n\n_But I have no family--none living. That is why I am here._\n\nJohn put the bag into her hand and closed her fingers over it, then\npushed her hand against her chest. The bag was very heavy for its small\nsize. He frowned, put his finger to his lips, and waved his hand. He was\ntrying to tell her, she thought, that this was a special present for\nher, that she was not to tell Madama Tilia about it. He did not know\nthat Tilia had been watching everything they had done together.\n\nHe pressed the callused palm of his hand against her cheek and said\nsomething, then turned and quickly walked out of the room.\n\nAnd Rachel was alone with her desolation. She wanted to sleep. There\nwere no windows in this room, but it must have been morning by now. She\nrealized that she did not feel sleepy, although she was tired. She felt\na dull ache down inside herself, where he had broken the seal of her\nvirginity. The bag of money lay heavy in her lap. Perhaps if she drank\nsome wine it would help her sleep.\n\nShe heard men's voices, loud and rough, in other parts of the house. A\nman laughed, and then a woman laughed. How many men had come with the\nTartar? She felt too tired even to crawl to the edge of the bed and pour\nherself the wine. She picked up the money and pushed it under a pillow.\nPerhaps Tilia had not seen him give it to her. She had done this for\nmoney, and she ought to get as much as she could for it.\n\nThe door swung open and Tilia was standing there, her wide mouth\nstretched in a broad smile, and her hands rose in benediction. \"You were\njust what he wanted. He seemed most pleased.\"\n\nRachel tried to smile. \"It was not as bad as I thought it would be.\"\n\nTilia shrugged. \"Men who are terrible in warfare are sometimes kinder in\nbed. I thought his zipolo rather small, did you not? That was lucky for\nyou.\"\n\nRachel felt her face grow hot. \"I have seen only one other--when it was\nhard like that. And it _was_ bigger.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Tilia, \"small as this Tartar was, he was able to mount you\ntwice, and that is remarkable for a white-haired man who has been up\ndrinking all night.\" Then she laughed. \"Ah, but you should have seen the\nFrench cardinal who came here with this Tartar. He asked for three\nwomen, and he swived each one of them mightily. Those French! I care not\nfor their high-horse airs, but they are a lusty lot.\"\n\nRachel felt herself smiling. Was it so easy to begin to think like a\nwhore and laugh at whores' jokes?\n\n\"Well,\" said Tilia, \"we must get you washed out at once. You do not want\nto be giving birth to a little Tartar in your first year as a woman, do\nyou?\" She went to a cabinet and drew out a grayish-white bladder with a\ntube coiled beside it.\n\n\"Peculiar-looking if you have never seen one before,\" said Tilia. \"But\nthere is nothing to worry about. It does not hurt. We just fill the\npig's stomach with warm water and squeeze it, and the water goes through\nthe vellum tube and up inside you. The women of Rome used them centuries\nago when they did not want to get pregnant. I suppose that is why the\nbarbarians finally overran Italy.\"\n\nRachel looked at the thing Tilia laid on the bed beside her and felt\nsick.\n\n\"Oh, by the way,\" said Tilia as she went back to the cabinet and got out\na basin and a pitcher, \"I will let you keep the purse he gave you. He\nlooked so happy when he left here, I think you deserve it.\"\n\nThe Tartar could come and go as he pleased, thought Rachel, but she must\nstay. Even now, with over five hundred florins, more money than she had\never had in her life, she was alone. She knew how to travel; she had\ntraveled for two years with Angelo. But she also knew the terrors and\ndangers of the road, dangers that ultimately had killed Angelo.\n\nThe best she could hope for was to endure this life for a year or two,\nget what she could from it, let it make her rich. When she did leave,\nshe would have enough money to hire guards to accompany her. She would\nmake up an elaborate story about her past. She would go where no one\nknew her, Sicily perhaps, and begin a new life as a wealthy woman,\nventuring into banking or trading for herself.\n\nThe hope of a wealthy new life--that was the raft that would bear her up\nwhen she felt she must drown in sorrow.\n\n\n\n\nXXVII\n\n\nDaoud's tired eyes burned. He shut them, as he entered his bedchamber,\nagainst the bright light coming through the white window glass. But,\ntired as he was, sleep did not come. Perhaps he was too tired.\n\nHe had missed the proper time for morning prayer, but he poured water\ninto a basin and washed his hands and face, then turned toward the risen\nsun and humbly addressed God, first bowing, then kneeling, then striking\nhis forehead on the carpet.\n\n_When I pray, I am at home no matter where I am._\n\nAfter praying, he pushed open the iron casement with its diamond-shaped\nglass panels to let in air and then pulled the green velvet curtains\nacross the window to shut out light.\n\nHe moved now in a cool dimness, as if underwater. He must rest, to be\nstrong for the next battle.\n\nCrossing the room to his sleeping mattress, which lay on the floor\nEgyptian-fashion, he stripped off his sweat-soaked tunic and threw it\ndown. He unbuckled his belt and laid it carefully on the mattress. Then\nhe kicked off his boots and dropped his hose and his loincloth. He\nsplashed water over his body and felt cleaner and cooler.\n\nThere was another way to be home. He had been waiting for the first time\nhe could feel he had triumphed. He knew all too well what that way could\ndo to a man in the aftermath of defeat--sharpen his misery till he could\nease the pain only by destroying himself.\n\nBut last night he had unmasked the Tartars before all the great ones of\nOrvieto, and he had survived a street encounter with bravos who intended\nto kill him. And so this morning he could allow himself this.\n\nHe had brought a cup of kaviyeh from Ugolini's room. He set it on the\nblack marble table beside his sleeping mattress. Then from his traveling\nchest he took the dark brown leather pack that had accompanied him here\nfrom Lucera. He felt for the small packet and drew it out. Unwrapping\nthe oily parchment, he looked at the small black cake, a square about\nhalf the length of his finger on a side. He drew his dagger out of its\nsheath--the dagger that would have been poor protection for him earlier\nif he had had to fight those Filippeschi men. Carefully he shaved\npeelings from the cake to the polished black marble. With the sharp edge\nof the dagger he chopped at the peelings until he had a coarse powder.\nHe held the cup of cooling black liquid below the edge of the table and\nscraped the powder into it. He stirred the kaviyeh with the dagger's\npoint.\n\nHolding the cup up before him as if he were offering a toast, he spoke\nthe Hashishiyya invocation: \"In the name of the Voice comes Brightness.\"\n\nHe put the cup to his lips and sipped it slowly. The lukewarm kaviyeh\nmasked the other taste, but he knew it would begin to work as soon as it\nreached his stomach. He peered into the bottom of the cup to make sure\nhe had missed no precious grains, then set it down.\n\n_The magic horse that flies to paradise_, so the Hashishiyya called it.\n\nFrom Sheikh Saadi he had learned how to resist the power of drugs. From\nImam Fayum, the Old Man of the Mountain, he learned how to use them,\nwhen he chose.\n\nNaked, Daoud lay back on his mattress with a sigh that sounded like a\nroar in his ears. If the Filippeschi came upon him to kill him now, he\nwould greet them with a smile and open arms. Lying on his back, his head\nresting on a feather-filled cushion, he let his senses expand to fill\nthe world around him. His eyes traced the intricate red-on-red floral\npattern of a damask wall hanging. The humming of a large black fly that\nhad blundered in through the open casement and the closed curtains\nresounded in his ears like a dervish chorus chanting themselves into an\necstasy.\n\nOdors swept in through the open window--clean mountain air with the\nscent of pines in it, but from nearby the swampy foul reek of every kind\nof filth produced by thousands of human beings living too close to one\nanother. It had rained last night, but not enough to clean the streets,\nand the scavenging pigs--Daoud's heightened senses could hear and smell\nthem, too--could not keep up with the garbage and sewage produced by the\novercrowded people of Orvieto.\n\nBut he need not remain in Orvieto. He raised his head and lifted the\nchain that held the silver locket about his neck. Turning the little\nscrew that fastened the lid of the locket, he let it fall open. It\ncovered most of the palm of his right hand. Holding the crystal disk\nbacked by silver close to his eyes, he saw his face reflected back at\nhim from the convex surface. His image was broken up by a pattern etched\ninto the transparency, a five-part webwork of interlocking angles and\nboxes, spirals and concentric circles. The pattern formed a maze too\ncomplex for the eye to grasp. He believed that the man who used a\nstylus, doubtless diamond-pointed, to cut the design into the crystal\nmust have gone blind in the course of his work. No mosque bore a more\nintricate--or more beautiful--pattern on its walls.\n\nHis eyes, as they always did when he looked into the locket, tried to\nfollow the pattern and became lost in it. As the drug extended its\nempire within him, it seemed that he could actually see his eyes,\ncoalesced into a single eye, staring back at him from the net of lines\nand whorls that entrapped it.\n\n_The captive eye means that the locket now controls what I see._\n\nHe saw the face of Sophia Karaiannides. Her dark lips, luscious as red\ngrapes, were parted slightly, showing even, white teeth. Her\nthick-lashed eyelids were half lowered over burning eyes. Her hair hung\nunbound in brunette waves on either side of her face. She had splashed\nwater on her face, and the droplets gleamed on her cheeks and brow like\njewels.\n\nDaoud had no doubt that he was seeing her exactly as she was at this\nmoment, somewhere else in the cardinal's mansion. The locket had that\nproperty.\n\n_But I do not want to see Sophia. I want Blossoming Reed._\n\nThen Sophia spoke to him. \"Oh, David, why will you not come to my bed?\"\n\nHer voice was rich as velvet. His muscles tensed with a sudden hunger, a\nlong-felt need that Francesca, the woman he bedded with now and then at\nTilia Caballo's, could never satisfy. Sophia, he realized, could give\nhim what he wanted, what he missed so terribly since leaving home.\n\n_No! Let me see Blossoming Reed._\n\nHe shut his eyes, and Sophia was still looking at him. The locket and\nthe drug together could show a man things he did not want to see, make\nhim feel things he did not want to feel. Things that were inside him\nthat he did not want to know.\n\n_The knowledge you run from is the most precious of all_, Saadi had\nsaid.\n\n_I know I want Sophia. I do not hide that from myself. But I cannot have\nher. Let me therefore see my wife, Blossoming Reed, she who gave me this\nlocket._\n\nSophia's image faded now, and he saw again the crystal and its pattern\nthat caught his soul like a fish in its toils. Gradually the pattern\nbecame the face of Blossoming Reed. Sparks flashed from her slanting\neyes, painted with black rings of kohl. Her wide mouth was a downturned\ncrescent of scorn. The nostrils of her hawklike nose flared proudly.\nThere was a message in her face. What did she know, and what was she\ntrying to tell him?\n\nBlossoming Reed, daughter of Baibars and a Canaanite wife Baibars had\nstolen from the crusader stronghold in Sidon. It was rumored that\nBlossoming Reed's mother practiced a kind of sorcery that was ancient\neven when the Hebrews were in bondage in Egypt. But would Baibars, the\nmightiest defender of the faith since Saladin, allow devil-worship in\nhis own house? Daoud could not believe it.\n\nAnd yet, what was this locket if not the work of some evil magician? He\nwould not have touched the thing, much less worn it, had it not come\nfrom Blossoming Reed, whom he loved.\n\nBlossoming Reed, betrothed to him at twelve, married to him at fourteen,\nwhose breasts were like oranges and whose nails flayed his back in their\nlovemaking. Blossoming Reed, Baibars's gift of honor to him, seal and\nsymbol of eternal friendship between Baibars al-Bunduqdari and Daoud ibn\nAbdallah.\n\nBlossoming Reed, who now spoke to him in anger out of the magic of\nhashish and the locket.\n\n_Go back to the Well, Daoud!_\n\nBack to the Well?\n\nTo the Well of Goliath?\n\nHe saw again the plain of tamarisk, thorn bush, and grass, and the long\nblack line of charging Tartars. Eagerly Daoud leaned forward in the\nsaddle. Tightly he gripped his bow.\n\n_Now, devils, now you will pay for Baghdad!_\n\nHe had relived that day, the greatest battle of his life, hundreds of\ntimes in thoughtful moments, in dreams, in hashish visions. What he saw\nnow were moments that seemed to leap at him out of the darkness.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nScreaming a war cry and brandishing a scimitar, a Tartar galloped at\nhim. They were in open ground. Daoud circled away, sheathing his saif\nand pulling his bow from its case. The Tartar chased him, guiding his\nhorse with his knees and firing arrow after arrow at Daoud. But he was\nin too much of a hurry. He was not aiming carefully, and all the arrows\nwhistled over Daoud's head.\n\nThe muscles of the black Yemenite stallion bunched and stretched under\nDaoud as its hooves thundered over the plain. He stood in the saddle. He\nturned and took aim along the shaft of his arrow at the center of the\nTartar's chest. The arrow went low, to Daoud's annoyance, and struck the\nTartar in the side of the stomach. But he must have been wearing light\nleather armor, for the arrow with its steel point went deep into him.\nThe Tartar gave a short cry and dropped his bow, then fell, like a\nstone, from the saddle into the sand.\n\nDaoud wheeled his Yemenite about, then jerked the horse to a stop and\njumped from the saddle with his saif out. The Tartar had somehow risen\nto all fours, but was vomiting blood into the sand. Daoud kicked him\nwith his red-booted foot and rolled him over on his back.\n\nHolding his saif high, he looked into the face of Nicetas, contorted\nwith pain and fear.\n\n\"Oh, God!\" he whispered. \"Oh, God, no!\"\n\nHe stood paralyzed. Their eyes met.\n\nNicetas said, \"You have to.\"\n\n\"God be merciful to me,\" Daoud said, and brought the saif down.\n\n\n\n\nXXVIII\n\n\nLorenzo's eyes ached as he stared through a peephole in the doorway of a\nstoreroom into the common room of the inn called the Angel. Alternating\nhis left and right eye at intervals, he stared at a bench by the\nopposite wall, where a hooded figure sat alone, holding a cup of wine in\nhis lap. As Lorenzo had instructed him, the tavern keeper had put a\nlighted candle in a sconce near where Sordello was sitting, so that\nLorenzo could watch his quarry.\n\nThe candle beside Sordello was one of only four in the common room--just\nlight enough for the innkeeper to be certain he was paid in honest coin\nwhile making it hard for his patrons to see the color of his wine. It\nwas early evening, and there were only about six men and women in the\nroom. All of them except Sordello sat on benches at the one long table\nnear the wine barrel. Sordello, leaning against the rough-hewn wooden\nwall, had to set his cup beside him.\n\nThe mercenary's square hand lifted the painted pottery cup into the\nshadow of his hood. Lorenzo knew Sordello was under the tightly drawn\nhood only because he had followed him diligently through the tangle of\nOrvieto's streets from the house where a dozen of the brigosi Lorenzo\nhad recruited were quartered.\n\nDaoud's secret army was growing. The evening after the contessa's\nreception Lorenzo had sealed a bargain with Marco di Filippeschi, who\nwas ready to help Daoud against the alliance if it meant striking a blow\nagainst the Monaldeschi.\n\nBefore any plans were made, though, there remained the question of\nSordello.\n\nA stout woman in a black gown came into the common room of the Angel and\nwent straight to the hooded man. The lower part of her face was covered\nby a black scarf. Anyone watching the hooded Sordello and the veiled\nlady would think theirs was just everyday wickedness--an adulterous\ncouple meeting for an assignation. She sat beside him on the bench.\nTheir heads drew together, and Lorenzo, behind a door across the room,\nwas too far away to hear.\n\nLorenzo heard a scratching behind him. He turned, but it was too dark\neven to see movement.\n\n_Rats_, he thought. _This work continually brings a man into the company\nof rats. Four-legged rats and men like Sordello._ He put his eye to the\npeephole again, just in time to see a slip of paper disappear into the\nwoman's deep sleeve. Whoever Sordello was reporting to, he was putting\nit in writing. Interesting that the man _could_ write. That put him a\ncut above the average bravo, in education, at least.\n\nThe innkeeper came over to offer the woman wine, but she waved him away\nwithout looking at him. She stood up, brushing the seat of her gown\nfastidiously, like one who was used to sitting in cleaner surroundings.\nWithout a gesture or a handclasp she left Sordello as quickly as she had\ncome. Nothing loverlike about those two.\n\nLorenzo decided to follow the woman, and left by the bolthole the tavern\nkeeper had shown him. He doubted that the old bravo would do anything\nother than sit there and get drunk.\n\nHe had to run through the alley beside the inn to catch a glimpse of her\ngoing around a corner. She was hard to see. The darkness of night was\nmade deeper by the jutting upper stories of the houses, and she was\nwearing black.\n\nHe kept running, his footfalls muffled by the mushy layers of moldering\nrefuse that paved the streets. A woman going through the byways of the\npoorest part of town after dark was taking a great chance with her purse\nand her honor. She was either well paid or very dedicated.\n\nLorenzo, whispering breathless curses, twice had almost lost her in the\nmaze before she emerged onto a wider street, the Via di San Remo. There,\nlights from windows made her easier to follow. Now he was quite sure\nwhere she was going, and was not at all surprised when she hurried up\nthe stairs leading to the front door of the Palazzo Monaldeschi. The\ndoor opened. There was a blaze of torchlight, and she pulled down her\nscarf to identify herself. Even from across the street Lorenzo knew her.\n\nAna, the woman who interpreted for the Tartars.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSophia entered Cardinal Ugolini's cabinet holding a letter written by\nSimon de Gobignon. It had been pressed into her hand by the French\ncount's young scudiero when she was out walking. She had read it over\nand over again before bringing it to David.\n\nHe was alone in the room. As he looked up from his seat on a pile of\ncushions on the floor, she caught her breath. In that white light coming\nthrough the translucent glass panes, David's grayish eyes took on an\nopalescence.\n\nThe cardinal's cabinet on the top floor was the best-lit chamber in the\nmansion. When Ugolini was not using the room, David often came here to\nstudy, write, and meditate. And when neither David nor Ugolini was\nthere, Sophia sometimes came to draw and paint.\n\nShe felt as if David were a magician, and that his eyes had cast a spell\non her. In Ugolini's cabinet it was easy to think of magic. She had\nalways associated magic with darkened chambers and cellars, but Ugolini\npracticed his magic at the top of his mansion, in a room with many\nwindows.\n\n\"The long-awaited answer from Simon has come,\" Sophia said, tossing the\nopened scroll down before David.\n\nDavid spread Simon's letter on his lap and read it, while Sophia looked\naround the room. On a table near a window lay that painted skull Ugolini\nkept toying with. On one wall were two maps of the heavens. Sophia\nrecognized the constellations in one of them, but the other was utterly\nstrange. One arrangement of stars in the second map seemed to take the\nform of a Latin cross. She studied with interest the paintings on\nscrolls nailed to the walls, of plants and animals so odd-looking that\nshe thought they might be an artist's inventions. One was a bird without\nwings, another a spotted animal that looked like a deer but had an\nenormously elongated neck. It might be pleasant to try painting such\ncreatures herself.\n\nAs David's eyes ran over Simon's letter, his lips curled in a faint\nsmile. Was it a smile of contempt for Simon's passionate outpouring,\nwhich she had, in her delight with it, all but memorized?\n\n    Lady, I cry you mercy. You know it not, but your gentle eyes are\n    more puissant than a mighty host. From those eyes have flown such\n    bolts as wound but do not kill, and they have pierced my heart. I\n    will bleed forever within my breast where none can see, and all will\n    wonder at my pallor and my weakness that have no outward cause.\n\n    The physick for any wound or illness, sages tell us, must be like\n    that which caused the hurt. Thus only you, who have delivered this\n    wound, can cure it. Let me come to you, I beg, under cover of night.\n    Let me but adore you in secrecy for a moment, and my strength will\n    return....\n\n\"He is almost as good as an Arab poet,\" David said mockingly as he\nhanded her back the letter. Did it bother him, she wondered, that Simon\nwrote words of love to her? David, she saw, was working on a letter of\nhis own on a tiny, thin scrap of vellum on a writing board which he now\nlaid over his knees. As if to show her that Simon's letter was of no\nmoment to him, he added to his own, writing rapidly with a quill dipped\nin an inkpot--but from right to left.\n\n\"You write backwards?\" she said, seating herself beside him on the floor\nto look at his work.\n\n\"No, Christians do,\" he said with a faint smile. He covered what he was\nwriting with his hand, but she caught a glimpse of lines that wavered\nand curled like tiny black snakes.\n\n\"Why bother to cover it? Do you really imagine that I could read that?\"\nLightly she touched the hand that covered the writing, noticing the fine\nyellow hairs on its back.\n\n\"I have to keep up the habit of secrecy.\" He gave her one of his rare\nfull smiles, and she wanted to reach out and hold his face between her\nhands. They were so close, she thought, sitting side by side here on the\nfloor. And alone. They had but to stretch out on this thick Arabian\ncarpet and wrap their arms around each other. But, of course, Ugolini or\none of his servants might come in at any moment. Her longing for David\nwas a constant ache. She had not thought of Manfred, save as a figure in\nthe background of their lives, in weeks. And as long as she did not have\nto meet with Simon, she was fully Sophia Karaiannides, and not troubled\nby the yearning of Sophia Orfali for the young French count.\n\nIf only David did not insist on keeping her at a distance.\n\n\"Do you still want me to let Simon de Gobignon visit me secretly?\" she\nasked.\n\nThere was a momentary silence between them.\n\nThen, \"Have I told you of any change in plans?\" he said gruffly. He\nlooked down at his scrap of parchment with the tiny crawling lines.\n\n\"What shall I let him do when we are together?\" she asked quietly.\n\n_I know David is jealous, and I am goading him. I want to hear his\njealousy._\n\nHe stood up abruptly and put his writing board on a table. He walked to\nan open window and stood looking out, rolling his thin parchment tightly\nbetween his fingers.\n\nShe hated this conversation. It turned him into a panderer and her into\na whore. And she sensed that he hated it as much as she did.\n\n\"Do what you think is necessary,\" he said coldly.\n\n\"_Necessary to what?_\" she demanded through gritted teeth.\n\nHe turned toward her and held up a finger. \"To win his trust.\" He held\nup a second finger. \"To hear and remember anything he may let slip.\" He\nheld up a third finger. \"Most important, to tell him things.\"\n\n\"Tell him what?\"\n\n\"Tell him that Cardinal Ugolini has persuaded Fra Tomasso d'Aquino to\noppose the alliance of Christians and Tartars.\"\n\n\"And if Simon believes you have won over Fra Tomasso, what will that\naccomplish?\"\n\n\"The unbelievers are already desperate to repair the damage I have done\nto the reputation of the Tartars,\" David said. \"If they think they have\nlost Fra Tomasso, they may be provoked to do exactly the wrong thing.\"\n\n\"What would that be?\" Sophia had heard that Muslims were devious. She\ncertainly could not follow Daoud's mind in this.\n\n\"Not knowing Fra Tomasso is actually trying to remain neutral, they will\nuse every means they have to try to win him back, as they think, to\ntheir side. I am hoping they will try to bring Cardinal de Verceuil's\ninfluence to bear. If de Verceuil goes to Fra Tomasso--or, even better,\nto Fra Tomasso's superiors--he may well drive the learned friar over to\nour side.\"\n\n\"What if you are wrong? What if de Verceuil and the other Franks do\npersuade Fra Tomasso to support the alliance? Would it not be better to\nleave him where he is, neutral?\"\n\nDaoud shook his head. \"At least this way we are trying to control what\nhappens.\"\n\nShe smiled. \"I thought you Muslims believed in leaving things up to\nfate.\"\n\n\"The efforts of men are part of the workings of fate.\"\n\nShe would probably never understand his Muslim way of thinking. Perhaps\nhe would not accept her love because he saw her as an unbeliever. It\nmade her angry to think he might hold himself aloof from her because of\nher religion, and he not even a Muslim born.\n\n\"The Turks killed your parents,\" she said. \"How can you be a Muslim?\" It\nwas something she had never understood and had wanted to know ever since\nshe learned what he was, but she asked it now to hurt him.\n\nHe gave her that silent, burning stare, and she began to wonder, with a\nrippling of fear in the pit of her stomach, if she was in danger.\n\n\"That was my fate,\" he said. \"I had to lose my mother and father to find\nGod.\"\n\nBefore she could catch herself, she started to laugh with a kind of\nwildness, a touch of hysteria. She had been angry at him and had goaded\nhim and feared his striking back, and instead he made a statement that\nwas utterly absurd.\n\n_I lost my mother and father, and I gained nothing from it. I became\nnothing, neither daughter, nor wife, nor mother._\n\nAt her laughter, he took a step backward, as if she had struck him, and\nhis tan face reddened. Now she felt terror. This time she had surely\ngone too far.\n\n\"Forgive me. Your answer surprised me. It sounds so strange for a man of\nyour profession to talk of finding God.\"\n\n\"What profession?\"\n\n\"Well, you are a warrior and a spy, not a holy man.\"\n\n\"We do not need to speak of this.\" He turned away from her to stare out\nthe window. She looked past him at red-tiled rooftops. A flock of\npigeons circled in the distance.\n\n\"No,\" she said. \"And as an unbeliever I suppose I would not understand.\"\n\nSurprisingly he approached her and looked down with eyes that were\nserious and free of anger. \"If you ever, in sincerity, want to know\nabout Islam, come and ask me, and as best I can I will answer your\nquestions. But do not speak foolishness. And do not laugh.\"\n\nShe thought she understood a bit better. The Muslims had captured his\nbody, but then in his enslavement he had freely given his soul to their\nreligion. He did not serve the Turks. He served the God they called\nAllah. How this had come about she could not imagine. But she knew a\nlittle better why his sultan had entrusted him with this undertaking. He\nwas perfect for it.\n\n\"I must go,\" he said, as if eager not to talk anymore.\n\n\"To deliver your message?\" She gestured toward the clenched fist that\nheld the fragile parchment. \"Is there truly someone in Orvieto who can\nread it?\"\n\nHe smiled again. Oh, that smile! It so easily overcame her anger and\nfear.\n\n\"There is no harm in my telling you. It goes to my sultan, by carrier\npigeon and ship.\" He must be proud, she thought, of his swift and secret\ncourier system.\n\n\"And do you get messages back in the same way?\"\n\n\"It takes over a month each way, so I have received but one message from\nthe sultan since coming to Italy.\"\n\n\"Does the cardinal keep the pigeons?\"\n\nHe had taken a tiny leather capsule out of his belt purse and was\ninserting the message into it now. \"Madama Tilia keeps the pigeons.\"\n\n\"Then are you going to her house?\" Sophia remembered with a feeling of\nguilt that she had not thought of Rachel in some time. \"Please, David,\nwill you see how Rachel is while you are there?\"\n\nDavid looked at her quickly and glanced away. She felt a coldness in her\nchest.\n\n\"What has happened to her?\" she demanded. She seized David's arm, lest\nhe turn away from her.\n\nHe did not try to pull free. \"She is well. She is already wealthy, in\nfact.\" His eyes did not meet hers at all now.\n\n\"Oh, my God! A man has had her!\" She let go of David and turned her back\non him.\n\nThere was another silence while fury churned in Sophia. She wanted to\nturn on David, to scratch his face with her nails. She wanted to tear\nher clothing in anguish, in mourning for Rachel's lost innocence. She\nhated herself for her part in the child's degradation.\n\n\"Sophia.\" David's voice came from behind her, soft, a little uncertain.\n\"Were you so much older than Rachel when you--became a woman?\"\n\nWrath overpowered her other feelings, and she turned on him. \"Do you\nthink _that_ is what makes a girl into a woman? And you complain about\nspeaking foolishness?\"\n\n\"How old, Sophia?\" His voice was more confident now, as if her anger had\nput him on firmer ground.\n\nShe thought of Alexis, the boy she had loved, and the long afternoons\nthey had spent together hidden under an old broken arch covered with\nvines and lapped by waves on the Aegean side of Constantinople.\n\nShe shook her head. \"Yes, I was her age. But I was in love. Doing it for\nmoney or for my city came later, when I was alone in the world and\nolder.\"\n\nThere was appeal in his look. \"But you know what it is to be alone and\nin need. Just as you freely chose to serve the Emperor of Constantinople\nwith your body, so Rachel freely chose to sell her virginity for a\nfortune in gold.\"\n\nHis obtuseness made her more angry than ever. \"You know nothing about\nfreedom or women. Rachel was no more free to keep her virginity than you\nwere free to remain a Christian after the Turks captured you. As for me,\nat least I know enough to hate the murderers of my parents.\"\n\nHis fingers dug into her shoulders until they hurt and the fire in his\neyes terrified her. But she held her face frozen, refusing to show fear\nor pain.\n\n\"Say no more,\" he whispered in a strangled voice. \"Not another word.\"\n\n_Saint Simon, protect me._\n\n_Simon._\n\nShe could see the struggle in David's face and body. She had enraged him\nto the point where he wanted to hurt her. But he was not going to let\nhimself do it. She thought she must have taken a hundred breaths before\nhe released his grip on her shoulders, pushing her away a little.\n\nAgain she wondered what he had been through that would give him such\niron self-control. She stood looking at him, breathing heavily in the\naftermath of her terror.\n\n_I am a fool to despise anything as powerful as what he has._\n\nHe raked her with his eyes, then turned toward the door.\n\n\"Do not bother to find out about Rachel for me,\" she said. \"I will go\nmyself.\"\n\nHe stopped, and the fury in his face made her brace herself again for an\nattack.\n\n\"You cannot go. You cannot be seen going into Tilia's.\"\n\n\"Do you think I have served great men for years without learning how to\nmove about a city unnoticed?\"\n\n\"Go, then.\" His normally fair face was scarlet with rage. \"And learn\nfrom Rachel's own lips what the Tartar did to her.\"\n\nFor a moment she seemed to go blind and deaf. She felt hot and cold at\nonce. Her body had reacted to the meaning of his words before her brain\nunderstood them.\n\n\"_Tartar!_ The man was a Tartar? You let a Tartar have her?\" Sophia\nseized the first object near her hand and threw it at him. She saw as it\nstruck him that it was the painted skull. It hit his chest with a thump,\nand he took a step backward.\n\n\"You filthy bastard!\" she screamed. \"Pig of a Turk!\"\n\nExpressionless, he turned without another word and left her, closing the\ndoor of Ugolini's cabinet behind him.\n\nShe sank weeping to the floor.\n\n_Rachel, Rachel, how could they do this to you? With a Tartar. Oh, no!_\n\nShe sat there until her tears stopped and her thoughts began to make\nsome sense. The skull, lying on its side, seemed to look back at her.\n\n_Thank you, David. You have made my decision for me. Simon de Gobignon\nshall have me._\n\n\n\n\nXXIX\n\n\nThis was a fearsome place, thought Daoud as he gazed around the\nunderground chamber hewn out of the yellow tufa on which the building\nstood. Lit with torches, its vault was festooned with ropes and chains,\none wall lined with whips, rods, and scourges hanging from hooks, pokers\nand branding irons heating in smoking braziers, a rack in one corner, a\nring of wood and iron six feet in diameter suspended in the center of\nthe room, on which a man could be spread-eagled. A veritable bazaar of\ntorture instruments. Its door was of solid oak reinforced with\ncriss-crossed strips of iron, designed to dash any hope of escape.\n\nDaoud sat in a thronelike chair painted black--Tilia said it had once\nbelonged to a pope--on a raised platform against a wall. If the damned\nchair had a few cushions in it, it might almost be comfortable. This\nplace, Tilia had told him, was for patrons of hers who liked to\ntorture--or be tortured.\n\nIt was perfect for his purpose. But could he himself be as perfect as\nthe room? This was a hard and wily man he had to deal with tonight. It\nwould be difficult to dominate him.\n\nBeside Daoud, a preparation of wine, hashish, and the distilled juice of\nthe Anatolian poppy simmered in a pot held on a metal tripod over a\ncandle flame. He sniffed the faint steam that rose from the warm potion.\nHe warned himself to do no more sniffing, or he would be unable to\nconduct the night's proceedings with a clear head. He glanced down at\none broad arm of the throne, where a small brass bowl lay. In the dish\nrested a steel needle as long as a forefinger, its tip covered with a\nblack paste.\n\nA nervous anticipation tingled in the pit of his stomach, but he held\nhimself very still.\n\nDaoud heard Lorenzo's voice, and a moment later the oak-and-iron door\nswung open. A man stumbled through, his head covered with a black hood,\nhis hands tied behind him, his ankles chained close together with\nhobble-gyves. Two of Tilia's mute black slaves held his arms. Behind him\nwalked Lorenzo, a broad-bladed dagger held at waist level.\n\nDaoud sat straighter in the throne, resting his hands on the arms. The\ndoor boomed shut, and at Lorenzo's command the slaves untied the\nprisoner's wrists and pulled the hood off his head.\n\nSordello stood before Daoud, blinking and staring angrily around him.\nDaoud watched, pleased, as the sight of the irons and chains and\nscourges bore in on Sordello and the anger on the bravo's face changed\nto alarm.\n\n\"Why have you done this to me? What the devil is this place?\"\n\nAn appropriate question, Daoud thought. \"You are in hell,\" he said.\n\nSordello squinted at Daoud. \"And who are you supposed to be, Messer\nDavid, the Prince of Darkness? Is this some sort of miracle play?\"\n\nThe man's defiance dismayed Daoud. He had hoped that the mere sight of\nthe chamber would set Sordello to babbling and begging. He needed to be\nfrightened more.\n\n\"Have them chain him to the ring, Lorenzo.\"\n\nSordello aimed a kick at one of the slaves following Lorenzo's orders.\nThe African gave Sordello's arm a quick twist and got a howl of pain out\nof him. Soon the aging bravo, arms stretched out, legs spread apart, was\nsuspended upright in the great hoop. The ring of iron hung from the\nceiling on a single chain wrapped around a huge beam, allowing it to\nrotate slowly. Daoud imagined how helpless Sordello must feel hanging\nthere.\n\nLorenzo took hold of the ring and gave it a spin. Face and back, face\nand back, face and back, Sordello whirled before Daoud. His eyes bulged.\n\n\"Figlii di cagne!\" he shouted.\n\n_Still more angry than frightened. But perhaps he is just good at\nconcealing his fear._\n\nDaoud made a small hand gesture, and Lorenzo stopped the spin of the\nring so that Sordello was facing Daoud.\n\nDaoud studied Sordello, looking for the subtle signs that would reveal\nhis true feelings. His eyes gleamed like a caged hyena's, full of hatred\nfor Daoud.\n\nLorenzo had kept Sordello locked in a pitch-black cubicle in Cardinal\nUgolini's mansion for a day and a night before bringing him here. Daoud\nstudied the man. It was obvious from his pallor, his red-rimmed\neyelids, and his sagging mouth that Sordello had lain awake much of the\ntime in the darkness. Daoud could see the fear, too, in the clenching\nand unclenching of Sordello's jaw muscles.\n\nDaoud flicked a finger at Lorenzo. \"Read the love song you found on this\ntrovatore when you seized him.\"\n\nLorenzo unfolded a square scrap of parchment and read:\n\n    Your Magnificence:\n\n    On Thursday last Donna Sophia left the Cardinal's mansion alone, on\n    foot and heavily veiled. As she clearly did not want to be seen,\n    your servant thought much was to be gained by following her, and so\n    did. I regret to say she spent the afternoon wandering in the\n    craftsmen's market, shopping for gloves, purses, and other\n    adornments. Before Nones she went to the Church of Sant' Andrea,\n    where she prayed a while, then went to Confession. Your servant\n    attempted to approach close enough to overhear, but was unable to do\n    so without being seen.\n\nLorenzo looked up and shook his head. \"What a furfante you are! Trying\nto eavesdrop on penitents.\" He went on with the reading.\n\n    David of Trebizond has spent his days riding about Orvieto, meeting\n    with the fattori of various trading houses that deal in silks and\n    spices. Your servant adds a list below. The cardinal sleeps most of\n    the day and works through the night behind the locked door of his\n    cabinet on the top floor of the palazzo. Sometimes he mounts to the\n    roof and studies the stars with the aid of magical instruments. Of\n    the servant Giancarlo I am unable to make report, having not seen\n    him all this week.\n\nLorenzo laughed. \"That is the only true statement in this list of lies.\nYou did not see me all week because I have been constantly at _your_\nback.\"\n\nSordello spat at Lorenzo's feet. \"Ladruncolo! Sneak!\" At this Lorenzo\nand Daoud broke into laughter, while Sordello glared at them helplessly.\nThe hoop on which he was splayed turned slowly one way and then back the\nother.\n\n\"You are indignant at being spied upon?\" Lorenzo chuckled. \"Then imagine\nhow we feel. And what is worse, you do not even tell the truth about\nus.\"\n\n\"I piss in your teeth,\" Sordello snarled.\n\n\"For instance, what you write about Madonna Sophia,\" Lorenzo went on,\nunperturbed. \"You lost her a mere three streets from the cardinal's\nmansion. She knew you were following her and took pains to rid herself\nof your unwanted attentions. But you could not admit to your master what\na buffone you are, so you made up all that about her buying gloves in\nthe bazaar and going to church.\"\n\nActually, Daoud thought, that was the afternoon Sophia had come here, to\nTilia's house, to see Rachel, and it would have been disastrous if\nSordello had followed her. They would then have had to kill him, which\nwould have been unfortunate, since this way of handling him was so much\nbetter.\n\nOf course, they might still have to kill him. He already knew enough\nabout them to send them all to the stake if he ever spoke out. He must\nbe brought under control, to serve their purposes, or he must quietly\ndisappear.\n\n\"So, you not only spy on us, but you lie about us,\" said Daoud. \"And to\nwhom do you send these lies? When the Bulgarian woman Ana takes your\nweekly reports back to the Palazzo Monaldeschi, to whom does she deliver\nthem? De Verceuil? De Gobignon?\"\n\n\"Go peddle your silks and spices, Messer David.\" The man was so\nill-tempered he had not the sense to try to protect himself by hiding\nhis anger and defiance.\n\nDaoud gritted his teeth in frustration. Sordello was not breaking\nquickly enough.\n\nDaoud sent Lorenzo a signal with two fingers. Lorenzo sprang at Sordello\nwith his blade, a dagger so big it was almost a short sword, and slashed\nat his tunic, belt, and hose. The blacks grinned. Sordello roared his\nprotests. A last flick of the blade cut away his grimy loincloth. In a\nmoment Sordello hung naked on the ring, his shredded clothes hanging\nfrom his ankles or lying on the flagstone floor. His body was wiry and\nmuscular, with only a small paunch at the waist. The flickering\ntorchlight picked out the shadows of scars crossing his chest and belly.\nDaoud stared with curiosity and faint distaste at the uncircumcised\npenis peeping from its thicket of grizzled hair.\n\nDaoud put his fingertips together and casually crossed his legs,\nlounging back in the throne, letting the contrast between his position\nand Sordello's sink in. He prayed that the man might succumb. His soul\nmust be made of sand; how could it be otherwise?\n\nThe ring slowly rotated. Sordello twisted his head to look over his\nshoulder at Daoud.\n\n\"If you kill me, he will know.\" There was the faintest quiver in his\nvoice.\n\nDaoud chose not to ask the obvious question--who \"he\" was--but said,\nkeeping his voice soft and kindly, \"What will he learn from your death,\nSordello?\"\n\nBefore Sordello could answer, Lorenzo burst out, \"We are not going to\nkill him for a long while, are we, Messer David? You promised me I could\nhave some sport.\"\n\n\"Quiet, Giancarlo,\" said Daoud, narrowing his eyes. \"You shall have your\nsport.\"\n\n\"Why torture me? Why kill me?\" There was a plea in Sordello's voice now.\n\"I have told nothing that could hurt you.\"\n\n\"You have told _us_ nothing, Sordello.\" Daoud stood up. The platform on\nwhich the throne chair stood gave him impressive height, and the torches\nhigh in the wall behind him threw his shadow across the room.\n\n\"I admire your fidelity to your master, whoever he is,\" Daoud said with\na smile. \"What a pity he will never know about it. As I told you, this\nis hell, and you are dead already. You will just vanish, like a bit of\nrubbish washed out of the city by the rain. Your master will probably\nthink you deserted him, as your sort of wandering ladrone so often\ndoes.\"\n\n\"I am not a highwayman!\" Sordello's cry echoed against the stone vault.\n\"I am a man of honor. I am an educated man, a trovatore.\"\n\n\"You are feccia!\" Lorenzo shouted, and slapped Sordello's face hard.\n\n\"For that I will one day slice open your guts,\" Sordello growled.\n\nExasperated, Daoud saw that hurting Sordello only made him angrier. If\nthey hurt him enough, certainly, they would have him begging for mercy,\nbut by then they might have injured him so badly he would be of no use\nto them.\n\n\"Let him be, Giancarlo,\" Daoud snapped.\n\n\"I saved your life,\" Sordello said to Daoud. \"I killed a man for you. Is\nthis how you repay me--letting this pig strip me and beat me?\" His\nnarrowed eyes gave a hint of slyness. \"I could be worth ten of this\nNeapolitan mezzano to you.\"\n\n\"You dare call me a pimp!\" Lorenzo lunged at Sordello again, this time\naiming the point of the huge dagger at his belly. Sordello twisted his\nbody in the chains and gave a cry of fright.\n\n\"Giancarlo!\" Daoud shouted sternly. \"Back!\"\n\nSordello hung rigid in his chains. Sweat ran down his face. His whole\nbody was covered with sweat, glistening in the torchlight, and Daoud\nsuspected he would be cold to the touch. Sordello's eyes rolled from\nLorenzo, who stood frozen with the dagger outstretched, to Daoud and\nback again. The two blacks stood behind Lorenzo, smiling broadly.\n\n\"You are worth nothing to me at the moment, Sordello, because you refuse\neven to give me the one harmless piece of information I ask for. You\nwill not tell me who set you to spy on me. So I might as well give you\nto Giancarlo here for his amusement.\" He held a hand out to Lorenzo, as\nif giving him leave to proceed.\n\n\"It is Simon de Gobignon!\" Sordello cried. \"It is to him my messages\ngo.\"\n\nDaoud's heart leapt with exultation, and he allowed himself a satisfied\nlittle sigh. A flicker of a finger told Lorenzo to lower his knife.\nSordello had made the first surrender, on which all further success with\nhim depended.\n\nBut--de Gobignon. That was a surprise. Daoud had been sure it would be\nCardinal de Verceuil who would try to place a spy in his camp. A\nFrankish knight like de Gobignon would prefer the frontal attack, the\npitched battle, to trickery. That was why the Franks were gradually\nlosing their grip on the land they called Outremer. The French cardinal\nwas another story. Daoud had seen in him a combination of pride,\nambition, and lack of scruple that would use any means to defeat an\nenemy.\n\nHow to find out the truth? He ground his teeth.\n\n\"You are lying,\" Daoud said firmly. \"It is Cardinal de Verceuil you\nserve. Giancarlo--\" Daoud gestured, and Lorenzo went over to the brazier\nand slowly drew out an iron. The tip of it glowed red in the dim light\nof the chamber. His teeth flashing white under his thick mustache,\nLorenzo advanced on Sordello.\n\n\"No! It is the truth!\" Sordello shrieked, the chain that suspended the\nhoop rattling as he tried to pull himself away from Lorenzo and the\nsmoking metal rod he held. As Lorenzo slowly approached, Sordello\nbabbled out a tale of having been sent to Venice by Charles d'Anjou,\nbrother of the King of France, to recruit and command archers for Count\nSimon. He had gotten into a brawl and wounded an Armenian prince who had\ncome to Venice with the Tartars, and Simon had sent him away.\n\n\"I cannot serve Count Simon openly because the Armenians still want my\nblood,\" Sordello explained. \"So he set me to spy on you instead.\"\n\nThe frantic haste with which Sordello spilled out his story gave it the\nsound of truth. This was going much better. Daoud's tense jaw muscles\nwere relaxing.\n\nDaoud picked up the bowl with the needle in it, gestured Lorenzo back,\nand slowly strolled across the chamber to Sordello. He gave the bowl to\nLorenzo to hold, and drew closer until his face was only a hand's width\nfrom Sordello's, until he could smell the inner rot on the man's breath.\nSordello's eyes rolled sideways, trying to watch the needle in the bowl\nLorenzo was holding.\n\n\"What does de Gobignon say of me?\" Daoud whispered. \"What does he think\nI am?\"\n\n\"He thinks you are a foreigner brought here by Ugolini to thwart the\nFrench plans for a crusade,\" Sordello gasped. \"He says Ugolini is an\nagent of the Hohenstaufen king. He thinks Giancarlo is gathering a band\nof men to murder the Tartars. Please, for the love of God, do not hurt\nme, Messere.\" His eyes would fall out of his head if he stared any\nharder at the needle.\n\n\"Give me a candle, Giancarlo,\" said Daoud. He reached out without\nlooking, and Lorenzo pressed the lighted candle into his hand. Taking a\nstep back, he held the flame before Sordello's sweating face. His lips\ntrembling, Sordello turned his head away.\n\n\"Look at the flame, Sordello,\" said Daoud softly. \"Just look at the\nflame and listen to me. Look at the flame, and I will tell you what I\nreally am.\" Daoud passed the candle back and forth before Sordello's\nface, murmuring reassurance. Sordello's eyes followed the candle.\n\nHe wondered if this would work. It seemed too much like magic. He had\nseen it done by Hashishiyya imams, but he had never done it himself.\n\n\"I am a sorcerer, Sordello, a mighty wizard. I can pass through any\nobstacle. I can see what people are doing thousands of leagues away. I\ncan bring the dead back to life. I told you that you are a dead man,\nSordello. You are truly dead, but you have nothing to fear, because my\npower can bring you back to life.\"\n\nThe bravo hung lax in the chains, his half-shut eyes still moving from\nright to left, following the candle flame. His knees had buckled and his\nbelly sagged.\n\nDaoud handed the candle to Lorenzo and beckoned to one of the Africans,\nwho took the simmering pot of drugged wine from the tripod, holding it\nby a wooden handle, and gave it to Daoud.\n\n\"Where are you, Sordello?\"\n\n\"I am in hell.\"\n\n\"And what are you?\"\n\n\"A dead man.\"\n\n\"And I?\"\n\n\"A mighty wizard.\"\n\n\"Very good. Now drink this.\" Daoud felt the lip of the pot to make sure\nit was not too hot, then brought it to Sordello's mouth. Obediently\nSordello lifted his chin and opened his lips, allowing Daoud to pour the\nwarm wine into his mouth, and then swallowed. Daoud poured more into him\nand then gave the pot back to Tilia's servant.\n\n\"Now you will truly know my power, Sordello. Prepare yourself for the\nmost wonderful night of your life. You will make a journey from hell to\nheaven. Close your eyes and raise your head.\" Lorenzo held out the brass\nbowl with the needle, and Daoud took the needle, holding it firmly with\nhis thumb and first two fingers. Gesturing to Lorenzo to bring the\ncandle close to Sordello's throat, he searched out a vein just where the\nneck met the shoulder.\n\n\"You can feel nothing. You can feel no pain at all.\"\n\nDaoud took a deep breath and prayed to God to guide his hand. He jabbed\nthe needle into Sordello's neck. The bravo remained utterly motionless,\nand Daoud heard Lorenzo gasp in amazement. Daoud left the needle stuck\nin the pale, pink flesh. He watched Sordello closely and put his palm\nbefore his lax mouth. He could feel Sordello's breath on his palm, slow\nand steady, the breath of a sleeping man. After a time the craggy block\nof a head fell forward, and the body hung limp in the chains.\n\nSo far, all was working as he had hoped. But the man was stronger than\nhe had thought. He had been harder to break. There was always the danger\nthat somewhere deep in his soul a part would remain free. Daoud had\nheard of such things happening, of slaves of the Old Man of the Mountain\nwho suddenly rebelled. The methods of the Hashishiyya were not perfect.\n\nHe would have to chance it. It was in God's hands now.\n\n\"Are you sure he is not dead?\" Lorenzo said in a low, awed voice.\n\n\"Look for yourself. He breathes. His heart beats.\"\n\nLorenzo shook his head. \"What is that stuff?\"\n\nDaoud pointed to the two Africans, who stood calmly by, awaiting orders.\n\"_They_ know. In the jungle below the great desert, where it is very hot\nand wet, a body can rot in hours. Tiny men, less than half our size,\nlive there, and they hunt large animals for their meat. They smear this\nstuff on their darts. It comes from a mushroom that grows in their\nforest. The animal struck is paralyzed and unconscious, but it lives.\nThey have time to carry it back to their village, which may take days,\nand then they can slaughter it and butcher it.\"\n\n\"But what a blessing this could be for the wounded and the sick,\" said\nLorenzo. \"Why does the world not know of it?\"\n\nDaoud shrugged. \"The tiny men kill those who venture into their forests.\nWhat little is brought back by Arab traders is kept as a precious\nsecret. Only sultans may permit its use.\" He turned to the two blacks.\n\"Take him upstairs now.\"\n\n\n\n\nXXX\n\n\nWell satisfied with what Tilia had accomplished, Daoud gazed about at\nthe frescoed moons, stars, and suns scattered across the dark blue walls\nof the apartment. A cool night breeze blew through the rooms from\nwindows hidden by screens and gauzy curtains. In the large central\nchamber an oval pool gave off a scent of roses. Hangings of violet,\nsilver, and azure turned the rooms into a maze that baffled the eye.\n\nEverywhere Daoud looked he saw beds and divans and cushions. The floors\nwere covered with soft rugs and the tables laden with pitchers of wine\nand plates of peaches, grapes, and melon slices.\n\nIn a corner of a smaller room, its walls covered with maroon and black\ndrapes, the flame of a large candle warmed a solution of wine and\nhashish in a green earthenware bowl. A single silver cup stood beside\nthe candle.\n\n\"All this for one lousy traditore?\" said Lorenzo.\n\n\"After he has experienced what I have prepared for him tonight, he will\nno longer be a traitor,\" said Daoud. \"His very soul will be mine, and\nthat will be worth--all this.\"\n\nHe watched the two silent black men lug in the naked body of Sordello,\nand he pointed to a forest-green divan beside the pool. Gently they laid\nSordello there.\n\nTilia Caballo appeared from behind a curtain. At a gesture from her, the\ntwo black men bowed to Daoud and left.\n\nThree women followed Tilia into the room.\n\n\"Goddesses!\" whispered Lorenzo, staring.\n\nDaoud, who had chosen them, agreed. Two of them, Tilia had told him,\nwere sisters whose specialty was working together with one man. They had\nhair the color of honey, olive skin, and Grecian profiles. Each had a\ngold fillet in her hair and wore a short tunic of pure white linen. Each\ntunic left one delicate shoulder and one perfect breast exposed. On\nOrenetta the uncovered side was the right, and on Caterina the left.\n\nThe third woman was tall, taller than most men, and her bare shoulders\nwere broad. But her body, tightly wrapped in a gown of black silk that\nstopped just above her breasts, was magnificently female. Her long\nunbound hair was lustrous and black as her gown, her skin pale as snow.\nA gold collar that appeared to be woven of spiral strands encircled her\nneck. Maiga, Tilia said, was from Hibernia, an island west of Britain,\nand she spoke no Italian and did not need to.\n\nDaoud felt a fluttering in his chest as the sight of the three women,\nand the scent of the simmering wine brought back memories of his own\ninitiation at the hands of the Hashishiyya.\n\nIt had been the Tartars, indirectly, who had made it possible for him to\ntake that training. They had besieged and destroyed Alamut, the great\nPersian fortress of the Sheikh al-Jebal, the Old Man of the Mountain,\nand kicked him to death after he surrendered. The Old Man's surviving\nfollowers scattered across the lands of Islam. It was inevitable that\nsome of the highest adepts came for protection to Sultan Qutuz of El\nKahira.\n\nAfter they were settled, Baibars had gone to them with the proposal that\ncertain Mameluke emirs be initiated into the secrets of the sect. Fayum\nal-Burz, the new Sheikh al-Jebal, saw an opportunity to infiltrate the\nhighest levels of the Mamelukes and was only too pleased to comply.\n\nAnd so it had come about that Daoud, already trained by Saadi to resist\nthe power of hashish, passed through the gates of paradise and learned,\nin time, how to administer the same experience to others.\n\nOf course, Sordello, after he went through this, would be no adept. He\nwould learn no secrets. He would be the lowest of the low--a tool, like\nthe fedawi, the devoted killers who were the source of the Sheikh\nal-Jebal's power.\n\n\"This is a lucky man,\" said Tilia, her big mouth splitting her face in a\nlascivious grin. \"He will experience delights here tonight that many of\nmy most distinguished patrons have never enjoyed. His pleasures will be\nlimited only by what his body can endure.\"\n\nShe walked over to Sordello, asleep on the divan, and ran caressing\nfingers down his bare chest and belly. \"And he looks to be a strong man\nfor his age. These scars. Quite the veteran bravo, eh?\"\n\nThough the room seemed cool to Daoud, sweat ran over Tilia's bare bosom\ndown into the deep square collar of her purple gown. Her deadly pectoral\ncross lay heavily against the purple satin between her breasts. She\nmight need that cross tonight, Daoud thought, if anything went wrong\nwith Sordello.\n\n\"I begin to envy the man,\" said Lorenzo. \"Ill-treated as he has been up\nto now.\"\n\n\"Surely you are not such a fool,\" said Daoud brusquely. But then, he\nthought, Lorenzo had no real idea what initiation into the Hashishiyya\ndid to a man.\n\nA few last soft words of instruction to Caterina, Orenetta, and Maiga,\nand Tilia led Daoud and Lorenzo to a wall panel which swung open at the\npressure of her finger on a spring. The room they entered was as cool as\nthe one they had just left, its large open window covered over with fine\nnetting to let in air and keep out insects. But it was darker. Only a\nsingle fat candle burned in a large stick enameled green, red, and\nwhite.\n\nFrancesca, the woman Daoud had lain with on his previous visits to\nTilia's, rose with a smile and came to him. As Daoud took her hand and\nkissed it, she squeezed his fingers. The polished, carved beams that ran\nup the walls and across the ceiling of this room were the same color as\nFrancesca's hair, a dark brown. Opposite the window there was a small\nfireplace, dark and empty.\n\n\"Here, here, and here are the places from which you can watch what goes\non in there,\" said Tilia, marching along one wall and pointing to tiny\ncircular openings, each one ringed with a little _O_ of wood. Under each\nopening was a couch, and the openings were low enough in the wall so\nthat one could sit, or even lie down, and still look through them. The\nlight in this room had to be lower than in the room where Sordello was,\nDaoud realized, or the peepholes would be visible on the other side of\nthe wall.\n\n\"Francesca is here for your pleasure, should you find what is happening\non the other side of this wall arousing,\" said Tilia, dabbing with a\nhandkerchief at the pool of sweat that kept forming at the top of her\ncleavage. It must be her weight, Daoud thought, that made her perspire\nso much.\n\n\"You have thought of everything, Tilia,\" said Daoud.\n\n\"There is more,\" she said with a smile, and pulled on an embroidered\nstrip of purple velvet hanging from the wall. Daoud heard a bell ring\nsomewhere beyond the wall. Then through the door to the outer gallery\ncame two more of Tilia's black servants. The first one bore a wide\nsilver tray, and Daoud smelled a familiar and savory odor that filled\nthe air of the room. As the servant laid the tray on a round table,\nDaoud saw slices of roast kid garnished with shredded cheese on a bed of\nrice with peppers.\n\n\"Roast yearling!\" Daoud exclaimed, delighted.\n\nHe bit into a sliver of kid. It was delicious. The meat was accompanied\nby sliced boiled lemons sprinkled with nadd and scented with ambergris.\n\n\"But where did you learn to prepare such a dish?\"\n\nThe stout little woman rolled her eyes. \"There is much you do not know\nabout me. If I find you deserving I will tell you, one day. Meanwhile,\npartake! And you, Lorenzo. And Francesca. Levantine cookery will not\npoison you.\"\n\nThe second servant set a platter of peaches and figs and a flagon of\nkaviyeh beside the lamb. A good meal for a long night, thought Daoud.\n\nHe sat on one of the couches to peer through a peephole. He could see\nthe three women gathered around Sordello's inert form. They were\nmassaging him gently, as instructed.\n\nBut it would be a while yet before he woke and found himself with three\nbeautiful women, every pleasure they gave him enhanced by hashish.\n\n\"In the south we know and love Saracen dishes,\" said Lorenzo with a grin\nas he licked his fingers after helping himself to the kid. \"But, Madama\nTilia, am I to have food only? Shall I not have a companion to help me\nendure this night's work?\"\n\nTilia reached up and pulled at the end of his grizzled mustache. \"Only\nrarely does a Sicilian bullock set foot in my house. I am saving you for\nmyself.\"\n\n\"Meraviglioso!\" Lorenzo exclaimed. \"Instead of one of the handmaidens of\nVenus I shall have Venus herself.\"\n\nLorenzo's wit was itself meraviglioso, thought Daoud. But for him,\nsomething other than the games of Venus was uppermost in his mind. Ever\nsince his angry words with Sophia of a few days before, he had been\ntroubled by the thought of Rachel. And especially tonight when, even as\nhe passed the time here at Tilia's, Simon de Gobignon was visiting\nSophia. Sophia had been to see Rachel herself, but had refused to talk\nabout her. He wanted to reassure himself that Sophia had been wrong to\ncondemn him and that all was well with the girl.\n\n\"While we wait, Tilia,\" he said, \"I would have a private word with you.\"\n\nWhen they stepped out of the room Daoud said, \"I want to see Rachel.\"\n\nTilia frowned and was silent for a moment. \"In all honesty, she is well\nand happy, and richer by nearly two thousand florins. Your companion\nSophia visited her and found nothing amiss. And the roast kid will get\ncold.\"\n\nTwo thousand florins. Nearly enough, Daoud reckoned, to buy a mansion\nlike Ugolini's. But what of Rachel herself?\n\n\"Just take me to her, Madama.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen he first saw Rachel's surprised smile, he thought that she was\nindeed well and happy, as Tilia had said. But then her dark gaze was\naverted, her straight brows drawn together in a little frown. She\nstarted playing with the gold lace on the hem of her white satin gown.\n\nDaoud said. \"Well, Rachel. You look like a queen sitting there.\"\n\nEach woman at Tilia's had her special room, Daoud knew. The hangings in\nRachel's room were cream-colored, the tables and chairs and the bedposts\npainted ivory, and the canopy over the bed was cloth-of-gold. She sat in\none corner of the bed, with her legs curled under her.\n\n_It must have been on this bed that the Tartar had her._\n\n\"I am so pleased to see you, Messer David,\" she said in a low voice.\n\"How can I serve you?\" She smiled at him, but his trained eye saw that\nit was a false smile. And the hint of defiance he had noticed on first\nmeeting her in Rome was gone.\n\n\"Rachel, I only wanted to see with my own eyes that you are content here\nand well treated.\"\n\nHer eyebrows lifted slightly, and she shrugged. \"I have never till now\nknown such comfort, Messer David.\"\n\nDaoud realized that he should ask her about the Tartar. Tilia herself\nhad given him an account of Rachel's first night with John Chagan. The\npain Daoud felt at hearing what he had delivered Rachel to was relieved\nonly slightly by knowing that the Tartar had been surprisingly gentle\nwith her. At first, though, he had hated Tilia for being willing to risk\nRachel, and, impulsively, he had resolved to kill John. That made him\nfeel a little better, until, a moment later, he remembered that hating\nTilia and killing the Tartar would be no help whatever to Rachel. And\nhe, as much as anyone, was guilty of what had happened to her.\n\nSince John Chagan's first visit, Daoud knew, he had been back twice\nmore, paying a thousand florins each time to spend part of the night\nwith Rachel. He seemed much taken with her, and continued to be careful\nand kindly in his use of her body, Tilia reported. Watching them, Tilia\nhad learned nothing that Daoud could use. But there were things Rachel\nmight have noticed, useful things Tilia could not have observed through\na spy hole.\n\n_Not tonight. I will ask her for information another time._\n\nOne thing he must know, though, was whether Tilia had been telling him\nthe truth. \"Have you been hurt in any way?\"\n\nRachel looked at him, looked away and sighed. How enormous her dark eyes\nwere, Daoud thought, how soulful. Her stare made him uncomfortable, and\nhe was thankful that she soon looked away. She kept on toying with the\nhem of her gown.\n\n\"Everyone has been very kind. You need not worry about people hurting\nme. After all, Messer David, you are a merchant, as my Angelo was, and\nyou understand that goods must be kept in the best possible condition to\nobtain the best price. Everyone here understands that, too.\"\n\nThere was no mistaking the bitterness and despair in her voice. Had he\nfelt any differently after the Turks captured him, raped him, beat him,\nand sold him in the slave market?\n\n\"You are being given the money you have earned?\"\n\nShe nodded, not looking up. \"My share is five hundred florins for each\nof his visits. And he gave me a purse of three hundred the first time. A\nbonus, because I was a virgin. Madama Tilia keeps it for me, but I am\nallowed to look at it and count it.\" She looked up suddenly and said\nearnestly, \"I could not have fallen into better hands than Madama\nTilia's.\" But there was a deadness in her eyes that belied what she\nsaid.\n\n\"We did not force you to give yourself to the Tartar,\" he burst out.\n\nA light came into her eyes then, the fire of anger. \"Thank you for\nreminding me that I became a whore of my own free will. Is that why you\ncame to see me, Messer David? To tell me that this is all my own fault?\"\nHer lips stretched in a ferocious grin. \"Pay me enough and I will say\nanything you want to hear.\"\n\nRachel's eyes were fixed on his, and his on hers, and they stayed that\nway, frozen, until Daoud shut his eyes and slowly turned away.\n\nHe could not even think of a word to say in farewell. As he closed the\ndoor to her room behind him, his eyes burned and there was an aching\nheaviness in his chest. Remorse. He felt as if he had killed a\nchild--two children. Not just Rachel, but the boy David who had always\nlived inside him. The pain was unbearable. He longed to escape it.\n\n\n\n\nXXXI\n\n\nTilia eyed Daoud apprehensively. \"Is it not as I have said--she is well\nand happy?\" She lifted the pectoral cross to raise its gold chain away\nfrom her bosom and mop her flesh with a square of pale green silk. He\nremembered the blade in the cross, and wondered if she was afraid he\nmight attack her.\n\nHe wished he could hate her for what had happened to Rachel. But all\nTilia had done was introduce Rachel to a way of life that Tilia herself\nhad found rewarding.\n\n\"She is as well as I could have hoped,\" he said, hearing in his own\nvoice the deadness he had heard in Rachel's. He sat down heavily on a\ndivan.\n\nLorenzo looked at him searchingly. His big mustache hid his mouth when\nit was in repose, but his eyes were wide, and they glistened wetly in\nthe light of the one candle that illuminated this small room. The\nSicilian's hands lay limp in his lap, the hands of a man in pain and\nunable to do anything about it.\n\nThrough a peephole Daoud saw that Sordello had awakened. The gray-haired\nbravo was staring about him in wonder, only six feet away from Daoud's\neye, while Maiga gently pressed his shoulders back against the divan,\nOrenetta stroked his chest and whispered to him, and Caterina's blond\nhead rose and fell between his legs.\n\nFrancesca sat on the divan beside Daoud, offering him a slice of kid. He\ntook it and chewed it, but even though Tilia had cooked and seasoned it\nperfectly, it was tasteless to him.\n\nIt was not only Rachel's fate that troubled him, he realized. It was\nwhat was happening on the other side of this wall--those three lovely\nwomen ministering like houris of paradise to that old ruffian. They\nwould do it with skill and even with the appearance of enthusiasm\nbecause they had no choice. They did not even think of choosing. They\njust did as they were told. Their orders came, through Tilia, from\nDaoud. Francesca, here beside him, would do whatever he wanted, not\nbecause it was what _she_ wanted, but because she, too, had no choice.\n\nAnd he had never really thought what it meant for women to live this way\nuntil he saw, tonight, what had happened to Rachel.\n\n_God is a flame_, Sheikh Saadi used to say, _and each human soul a spark\nfrom that flame. When we treat our brother or sister like a thing, we\ntrample God Himself._\n\nThey were all slaves in this house of Tilia's. He had sent Rachel here\nto become a slave.\n\n_I, too, was once a slave._\n\nBut as a full-fledged Mameluke he was free. These women did not have\nthat way of escape. As long as they could, they must perform the act of\nlove, as it was called, with whoever paid them, or starve.\n\nBaibars had done well to close the brothels of El Kahira. It was the\nvery meaning of love that it was freely given. Love was free submission\nto another, just as Islam was free submission to God. Daoud had first\nexperienced love when he and Nicetas gave their bodies to each other.\nAnd later with Blossoming Reed, even though theirs was an arranged\nmarriage, that, too, was love.\n\nHe could not lie with Francesca tonight. It would be too much like lying\nwith Rachel. He could not watch what Orenetta, Caterina, and Maiga would\ndo with Sordello. The thing he was having them do to Sordello was an\nabomination. Despicable though Sordello was, he, too, had a soul, and\ntonight Daoud was trampling upon God in the person of Sordello.\n\nAnd yet he must see that all went as planned tonight. Did he want his\nhomeland destroyed?\n\n_But I have to get away from here._\n\nHe stood up suddenly. \"I must go back to Cardinal Ugolini's.\" Tilia,\nLorenzo, and Francesca stared at him.\n\nTilia recovered first. \"But you were to stay the night here. What\nabout--\" She gestured toward the wall.\n\nDaoud shook his head. \"I am not needed. And I have an important matter\nto discuss with Ugolini.\"\n\n\"Which you just remembered,\" Lorenzo said, eyeing him sourly.\n\nDaoud pressed his lips together. \"Those three women know what to do.\nThere is no need for anyone to intervene unless he starts to resist. And\nthen you can kill him as easily as I can.\"\n\nLorenzo stood up and bowed formally. \"Thank you for your trust,\nMessere.\"\n\n_If I am right in thinking that he hates this as much as I do, then he\nhates me for making him stay here._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe thump of Daoud's boots on the cobblestones echoed against the fronts\nof the huddled houses. Armed with sword and dagger, his head clear, and\nkeeping to the wider streets, Daoud felt safe from attack, even though\nit was well past midnight. Besides, the Filippeschi had been won over,\nso he need no longer fear them. Fear, he thought, was the wrong word for\nit. Tonight he would welcome battle.\n\nAnd he had the Scorpion with him tonight. He no longer ever made the\nmistake of going about in the streets of Orvieto at night without\ncarrying the Scorpion in a concealed pocket in his cloak.\n\nHe walked past the cathedral church of San Giovenale, and once again\nfrom the open doors heard the pale voices of the priests of the\ncathedral chapter. A heavy odor of incense, carried on the moist night\nair, filled his nostrils.\n\nPain crushed his heart as he passed beyond the pool of light that\nspilled out the cathedral door. He seemed to feel a heavy hand on his\nshoulder, and looked up. Conjured up from memory, his blond father\nappeared to tower over him, a red cross on the shoulder of his white\nmantle. A warm hand gripped Daoud's, and his mother, her red-gold hair\nbound with pearls, smiled down at him. Her dress was blue, like the\ndress she had died in.\n\n_What memories torment Rachel_, he wondered.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJust ahead of him, the narrow street opened into the broader one that\nran past Cardinal Ugolini's mansion. He had just passed an inn called\nVesuvio, after the burning mountain near Napoli, when a door opened\nsoftly behind him. Very softly, but it did not escape his trained ear.\nHe glanced back and saw the upper half of a divided door mate with its\nlower half.\n\n_Watching for me?_ That was unlikely, because a spy watching for him\nwould have had no idea when to expect him and would have had to stand by\nthat door all night. He looked back again at the doorway and then at the\ncardinal's residence. The street was wide enough to allow a person\nstanding in the doorway of the inn a good view of the front of the\nmansion.\n\nHe walked out into the square and turned to the right so that he could\nno longer be seen from the inn. Behind a filmy curtain on the third\nstory of the mansion shone a yellow glow. Sophia's room. Was that Simon\nde Gobignon in the inn doorway?\n\nNo, it was not, because now he saw de Gobignon. The unmistakable tall\nfigure was standing in the candlelit window behind the curtain. A thin\narm pushed the curtain back, and though the light was behind de\nGobignon, Daoud could see the Frenchman plainly, looking down into the\nsquare. Even though he was sure de Gobignon could not see him, Daoud\nstepped farther back into the shadows.\n\nDe Gobignon in Sophia's room. Daoud clenched his fists, and his lips\ndrew back in a snarl.\n\nThe Scorpion would not carry that far. No, but he could stride closer in\nan instant, aim at that spidery figure silhouetted against Sophia's\nlighted window, and bring down his enemy with a single bolt.\n\n_Why am I thinking such a thing?_\n\nWas he going mad? Sophia would let Simon make love to her, and in his\npassion he would tell her much. Perhaps Daoud could find out more about\nwhy Simon had sent Sordello into his camp. Perhaps Simon would give\nSophia some hint about the countermove he must be planning. Meanwhile\nSophia would trick Simon into thinking that Fra Tomasso had turned\nagainst the alliance.\n\nKilling Simon would be foolishness. Until now the mishaps that had\nbefallen the French and the Tartars had seemed accidental. Murder Simon,\nand his enemies would have proof that there were plotters in Orvieto,\nand they would seek them out. And the first place they would look would\nbe the place where Simon was killed, the establishment of Cardinal\nUgolini, the chief opponent of the Tartar-Christian alliance.\n\nStill, Daoud felt his blood seethe. He remembered a summer night over\nten years before, when he had bribed a slave and slipped through an\nunlocked gate into the arms of Ayesha, the young wife of Emir Tughril\nal-Din, then his commanding officer. They had lain together all that\nnight on the roof of the mansion of Tughril al-Din, bathed in sweat, and\nthe sweet terror of the blades that would hew his naked body to pieces\nif they were discovered goaded him into plunging into her again and\nagain. Only the moon and stars bore witness that he was enjoying the\nwife of his commander, the man who ordered him about and punished him\nwhen he made an error, the man who had the power of life and death over\nhim. Toward dawn, the delight of it bubbled up in his throat and he\nlaughed so loudly that the small Circassian girl put her hand over his\nmouth.\n\n_And now he does to me that which I did to Tughril al-Din._\n\nDaoud shook his head. Nonsense. Sophia was not his wife, and it was for\nthis very purpose, to seduce, corrupt, and spy upon the enemy, that he\nhad brought her here.\n\n_To use her, as I used Rachel and the women at Tilia's. First the Tartar\ntook Rachel, and now de Gobignon takes Sophia. And I am nothing but a\nslave and a panderer._\n\nA second silhouetted figure appeared beside Simon, much shorter, with\nunbound hair falling in waves and a narrow waist. Daoud saw Sophia rest\nher hand on his shoulder. A moment later she took the Frenchman's hand,\nand they both turned away from the window. The curtain fell back in\nplace behind them.\n\n_She leads him to bed!_\n\nDaoud was shaking with rage. Every muscle in his body ached to kill de\nGobignon.\n\n_Oh, God, give me the chance to destroy him!_\n\nHe heard another sound to his left, the scrape of a boot on\ncobblestones. His hand darting to his sword, he glanced toward the\nstreet he had just passed through. Nothing.\n\nDe Gobignon had brought a friend or servant with him. The friend was\nwaiting at that inn, where he could watch the front of Ugolini's\nmansion, and, perhaps, signal to de Gobignon as dawn approached.\n\nDe Gobignon's friend had been watching Daoud. He must be all in a sweat,\nknowing that Daoud had seen the young count in Sophia's window. He would\nexpect Daoud to raise an alarm. And if Daoud did not, then de Gobignon\nwould guess that David of Trebizond _approved_ Simon's making love to\nthe cardinal's niece. And from that it would only be a step to realizing\nthat David and Sophia must be plotting together.\n\nIt would extinguish any suspicion of Sophia the count might have if\nDaoud were to rush into the mansion, raise an alarm, and pursue Simon.\nBut if de Gobignon were caught, it would mean a scandal. His French\ncompatriots would certainly do all they could to stop him from seeing\nSophia again.\n\nAgain Daoud heard the scrape of a boot sole on the stone of the street.\nHe drew farther back under the overhanging upper story of a house facing\nthe mansion. Now de Gobignon's man could not see him without showing\nhimself.\n\nThere was only one thing to do. And it gave Daoud grim satisfaction to\nrealize it.\n\n_I cannot kill Simon de Gobignon, but I have to kill his man._\n\nHe drew the Scorpion from its pocket in the hem of his cloak. Quickly\nand silently he unfolded it. A leather case held a sting for the\nScorpion, a steel dart half again as long as his finger, coated with the\nsame paste he had used to render Sordello unconscious. He pulled the\nstring of twisted rawhide back with his fist, slipped the dart into\nplace.\n\nThe Frank took a step out of hiding. Daoud saw him as a big shadow at\nthe corner of the building. He imagined the Frank's thoughts. He must be\ntrying desperately to think of some way to warn his master before the\ncardinal's guards were roused.\n\nDaoud raised the Scorpion, but the darkness made the shot difficult. De\nGobignon's man was too hard to see.\n\n\"Pardonnez-moi, Messire,\" he said in the language he had not used since\nhe was ten. \"I have a message for Monseigneur the Count de Gobignon.\" He\nspoke in as casual and friendly a tone as he could muster.\n\nDaoud was close enough now to see that the man's hand was on his sword\nhilt.\n\n\"Why do you speak of the count to me?\" The voice was young.\n\n\"Because you are his man,\" said Daoud, and he thumbed the notched wheel\nthat held the bowstring in place. The string thrummed, the dowels sprang\nforward, and the dart buried itself in the Frenchman's body.\n\nTo avoid hitting breastbone or rib, Daoud had aimed for the stomach.\nThe Frank uttered a cry of pain and anger, and his left hand clutched at\nhis middle as his right hand drew his sword.\n\n\"You Greek bastard!\" he groaned, and fell first to his knees, then on\nhis face. So he had recognized him as David of Trebizond. He must surely\ndie.\n\nDaoud rolled the unconscious man over on his back. His fingers quickly\nfound the dart. Just a bit of it protruded from the Frank's stomach; his\nfall had driven it deeper. Daoud pulled the dart out, keeping his finger\non the wound. He laid the dart on the ground and drew his dagger. He\ndrove it upward just below the breastbone, striking the heart. The man's\ntorso jerked violently, the body trying to save itself even though the\nmind was asleep. As Daoud pulled the blade out, blood flowed out after\nit, warm on his hand. He whispered a curse and wiped his hand and his\nblade on the man's tunic.\n\nThis must look like a street stabbing, a man murdered for his purse.\nDaoud thrust his dagger into the body again, this time in the place\nwhere the dart had gone in.\n\nHe felt for a heartbeat and found none. He sheathed his dagger, felt for\nthe dart on the street beside the Frank, and put it back in its case.\nCase and Scorpion went back in the hidden pocket in his cloak.\n\nThe Frank's dead body was heavy as he dragged it into the deeper\ndarkness under the overhang of the nearest house. He fumbled about the\ndead man until he found his purse, a small one and not very heavy, and\ntucked it into his own belt. The pottery maker would be shocked in the\nmorning to find a robbed and murdered man on his doorstep.\n\nHad anyone seen? The houses around the square were dark and silent as so\nmany stone tombs. There was only that one light in the third-floor\nwindow of Ugolini's mansion.\n\nHe could not enter the mansion now, with blood on him. Whoever unlocked\nthe gate for him would be sure to connect him with the murdered man who\nwould be found in the morning. Orvieto's authorities would be\nquestioning everyone, and Ugolini could not control what his servants\nmight say.\n\nBack to Tilia's, then.\n\nHe chose another street leading out of the square so as not to pass the\ninn where de Gobignon's man had been on watch. As he walked, he cast his\nmind back over what he had done. The killing left him troubled.\n\nSaadi had taught him never to waste human life. _To wage war is a holy\nobligation. But have a care that you kill, not with a small soul, but\nwith a great soul._\n\nThis had been a necessary murder, Daoud thought. This young Frank had to\ndie that Islam might be saved from infidel hordes of East and West. But,\nlooking into his heart, Daoud knew that he had, indeed, killed with a\nsmall soul. He had been forced to kill de Gobignon's man, but he had\nalso wanted to, and he had felt unworthy triumph over Simon de Gobignon.\nIt had not even been an honorable fight. The Frank had no chance.\n\n_Purify my heart, oh, God_, he prayed as he walked back to Tilia\nCaballo's brothel.\n\n\n\n\nXXXII\n\n\nSimon remembered those kisses in the garden of the Palazzo Monaldeschi\nas he looked again at Sophia, and his arms ached to hold her. But he\nmust keep himself in check. He was still not sure he could trust her.\nAnd even if he were certain of her honesty, courtly love commanded him\nnot to touch her until months, perhaps years, of worshipful wooing had\npassed.\n\nSophia said, \"I must tell my uncle that his mansion is not as well\nprotected as he thinks it is. His guards must have been asleep tonight.\"\n\nHer oval face reflected the warm glow of the five or six small candles\nshe had placed around her room. Her dark brown hair was unbound and fell\nin waves to her shoulders. He felt his heartbeat quicken as he looked at\nher.\n\n\"You did invite me here, Madonna.\" Simon felt rather proud of the way he\nhad scaled the wall by the courtyard gate, waited till the cardinal's\nguards were out of sight, then climbed to the roof of the central wing.\n\n\"Yes, but I did nothing to help you, and I truly do not see how you got\nhere.\" She stood facing him, her hands at her sides. He was not sure\nwhether the gown she wore was for bed, or for him, or both. It was a\ntranslucent white tunic, sleeveless and cut deep in front, revealing the\nswelling of her breasts, pulled in at the waist by a cloth-of-gold belt.\nA large gold medallion stamped with a horse's head hung from a gold\nchain around her neck. His eyes kept traveling from her shoulders to her\nbosom to her narrow waist. The effort of holding himself back from\ntouching her was agony. Sweet agony.\n\n\"I am trained in the art of stealing into castles.\"\n\n\"I thought the French were more given to marching up to a castello in\nbroad daylight, banners flying, and taking it by storm,\" she said. Her\nteeth flashed in the candlelight. He wished she would invite him to sit\ndown. But then he saw in what she said an opportunity to raise the\nsubject of trust.\n\n\"True, Madonna. We French excel at open warfare, whereas you Italians\nseem more adept at intrigue.\"\n\n\"Intrigue? What do you mean?\"\n\nHe tried to sound lighthearted. \"Oh, for instance the clever way you\ndiverted my attention at the Palazzo Monaldeschi while David of\nTrebizond had the Tartar ambassadors making fools of themselves.\"\n\nFor a moment she did not speak.\n\nThen she said abruptly, \"I bid you good night, Your Signory.\"\n\nHe drew back, shocked. \"Madonna!\"\n\n\"The same way you came will see you out.\"\n\n\"I but meant to praise your skill at diplomacy. I hope I have not given\noffense.\"\n\n\"A gentleman always _knows_ when he is giving offense.\"\n\n\"I--I merely wish to clear--to set my mind at rest,\" Simon stammered. He\ncursed himself for his heavy-handed attempt to test her. It was true,\nthe French were no good at intrigue.\n\n\"Rest your mind somewhere else.\" She went to the door and stood there,\nback to him. Was she going to call for help? How embarrassing it would\nbe if he were caught here.\n\nThe beautiful curve of her back distracted and confused him still more.\n\n\"If you do not leave, I will,\" said Sophia, grasping the black iron door\nhandle. \"You may stay in this room forever if you wish.\"\n\n_What a brouillement I have made of this rendezvous._ Casting about\nfrantically in his mind, Simon wondered what his troubadour father,\nRoland, would have done.\n\n_Or Sire Tristan or Sire Gawain, what would they do now?_\n\nThere was no more time to think. He must act. He threw himself to his\nknees, arms outstretched, and waited. A long, silent moment passed.\nFinally Sophia turned her head. Her lips--those tender, rose-colored\nlips--parted and her eyes widened. She turned all the way around.\n\nShe started to laugh.\n\n\"Laugh at me if you will, but do not cast me out.\" The sound of her\nlaughter was like the chiming of a bell. After a moment she stopped\nlaughing and smiled. A lovely smile, he thought, a kindly smile. He\ncould happily kneel here for as long as she went on smiling.\n\n\"I have never had a man kneel to me before.\" A faint vexation flickered\nacross her face. \"First you accuse me of kissing you only to further my\nuncle's plots against the Tartars. Then you kneel to me. What am I to\nmake of you?\"\n\nRelief swept over him as he realized she was no longer angry.\n\n\"Make me your slave.\"\n\n\"My slave? You are toying with me, Your Signory.\"\n\n\"Toying with you? Never. Call me Simon if it please you.\"\n\n\"You would be my friend?\"\n\n\"I would be more than your friend, Madonna.\"\n\nShe came to him and held out her hands. Her smile was dazzling.\n\n\"Well then, Simon, you may call me Sophia. And you may rise.\"\n\nSimon grasped her hands, feeling joy in his very fingertips. He vaulted\nto his feet and thought of taking her in his arms, but she freed her\nhands with a quick, unexpected motion and took a step backward.\n\n_With just a movement of her hands she can lift me up or cast me down._\n\n\"For a man to kneel to a woman is not the custom in Sicily, Simon,\" she\nsaid softly.\n\nIt was as he suspected. She was not familiar with the ways of courtly\nlove.\n\n\"If I do anything that seems strange to you, Sophia\"--he used her name\nfor the first time, and it thrilled him--\"know that my actions are ruled\nby what we call l'amour courtois, which means that we know how to value\nwomen, whose value is beyond price.\"\n\n\"I have heard of courtly love. It sounds blasphemous to me, almost as if\nthe man worships the woman. I do not think your patron saint would\napprove.\"\n\n\"My patron saint?\"\n\n\"Him.\" She pointed to the small painting in a gilt wooden case that\nstood open on a large black chest. Candles in heavy enamel sticks stood\non either side of the painting.\n\nSophia took his hand. At the touch of her cool fingers the muscles of\nhis arms tensed. She led him across the room. Still holding his hand,\nshe spread the wings of the case wider apart so he could see the image.\n\nThat it was a saint was apparent at once from the aureole of gold paint\nencircling the black hair. Simon saw a narrow face with huge, staring\nblue eyes painted with such bright paint they looked like sapphires.\nCompared with the saint's eyes the sky behind his head seemed pale.\nThere were purplish shadows under the eyes, and the cheeks curved inward\nlike those of a starving man. The beard and mustache hung straight but\nwere ragged at the ends, and what little could be seen of the saint's\nrobe was gray. To the left of the halo, in the background, stood a\nfluted ivory pillar with a square base and a flaring top. The pillar\nconnected the azure sky and ochre ground. Simon felt admiration for the\nface; in that desolate scene the saint must have endured great privation\nand come through with holy wisdom.\n\n\"A wonderful face,\" he said, turning to Sophia with a smile. \"And you\nsay this is my patron saint?\"\n\n\"Simon of the Desert,\" she said. \"Simon Stylites.\"\n\n\"Stylites? What does that mean? I do not know Greek.\"\n\n\"Neither do I,\" she said, \"but a priest told me that his name means 'he\nof the pillar.' Saint Simon was a hermit who lived ages ago, when the\nChurch was young. He dwelt and prayed for thirty years on top of a\npillar that was all that was left of an ancient pagan temple. That is\nthe pillar behind him.\"\n\nLive on top of a pillar for thirty years? Questions crowded into Simon's\nmind. How did he keep from falling off when he slept? Would not the\nburning desert sun have killed him? How did he get food and water? After\nthirty years the pillar ought to be surrounded by quite a pile of--\n\nNo, he put that thought firmly out of his mind. After all, the whole\npoint about saints was that they were not subject to natural laws.\n\nHe asked only one question. \"How high was the pillar?\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"I do not know. So high that he had to climb a\nladder to get to the top. Then his disciples took the ladder away.\" She\npointed at the pillar in the painting. \"I tried to paint it so that it\ncould be any height you might imagine.\"\n\n\"_You_ painted this?\"\n\n\"You find that hard to believe,\" she said with amused resignation. \"That\nis why I hardly ever tell anyone. Many people would be sure I was lying.\nOthers would think that a woman who paints is some kind of freak. Or\nthat it is somehow dishonorable for a lady to paint, as if you, for\ninstance, were to engage in trade. What do you think?\"\n\n\"I think God has given you a very great gift,\" said Simon solemnly.\n\nShe squeezed his hand, giving him exquisite pleasure, and then, to his\nsorrow, let it go. \"I hoped you would understand.\" She put the\ncandlestick down, and Saint Simon Stylites receded into the shadows.\n\n\"I knew that you were going to be someone very important in my life when\nI found out your name is Simon,\" she said. \"I think my saint wished us\nto meet.\"\n\nHow sweetly innocent she was, Simon mused. He was ashamed of the\nthoughts he had been entertaining about her ever since they had kissed\nin the Contessa di Monaldeschi's garden. Over the days and nights he had\ngradually grown more and more familiar with her--in his fancy.\n\nHe had thought about holding her breasts through her gown, then putting\nhis hand on the warm, soft flesh, had thought about lying beside her in\nher bed, both of them nude. He had even, one cool night, allowed himself\nto imagine entering her body and lying very still, clasped inside her.\n\nThe ultimate act of l'amour courtois, this had been quite beyond his\npower of self-restraint with the women who played at courtly love with\nhim in Paris. The way Sophia excited him, it was even less likely that\nhe could hold himself back while remaining inside her for hours, as a\ntrue courtly lover was expected to do.\n\nAnd now Sophia went over to the very bed he had imagined, and perched on\nit. The frame of the canopied bed was high above the floor, and when\nSophia sat on it her feet dangled prettily, reminding Simon how much\nshorter than he she was. The sight of her on the bed made him tremble,\nfrightened by his own passion. There was no one here to protect this\ninnocent girl from him, except himself.\n\n\"Sit with me,\" she said, patting the coverlet beside her. He knew that\nthe best way to protect her was to go nowhere near her. But he wanted\ndesperately to sit beside her, to feel her hand in his again, to put his\narms around her.\n\n_But if I take her in my arms, on her very bed, how can I stop myself?_\n\nStill, she had invited him to sit with her, and an invitation from his\nlady was a command.\n\nHe had intended to sing a love song to her. He had not the skill at\nmaking poetry to be a troubadour, but he had a good tenor voice, and he\nhad learned dozens of troubadour songs early in life from Roland. He had\nsung them before he understood what they meant, because he liked the\nsound of them.\n\nHe bowed and went to the bed. He sat as far from her as possible.\n\n\"Will you let me sing for you?\"\n\nWhen she smiled, he noticed, dimples appeared in her cheeks. \"Oh, that\nwould be a pleasure. But softly, please. We do not want to rouse my\nuncle's servants.\"\n\nSoftly, then, he sang.\n\n    My love is the flower that opens at morning,\n    That greets with her petals the radiant sun,\n    Yet methinks 'tis not she who lives by the sun,\n    But the sun gives its light so my lady may shine.\n\nSophia's smile was itself sunny as he finished the first verse. She\nleaned back, putting her hands out behind her on the bed, and closed her\neyes as he sang the second and third. When he began the fourth verse,\nshe drew closer to him till their legs were touching. Making himself\nconcentrate on his music, he went on to the fifth verse. He resolved\nthat at the end of it he would stand up and move away.\n\n    At sunset my love will close up her petals\n    Till with the dawn she awakens again,\n    And her beauty will blaze out to dazzle the day.\n    To see her the sun will be eager to rise.\n\nBy the end of that verse she was leaning against him and had reached\naround behind him to stroke his neck. Without his consciously willing\nit, his arm stole around her waist and pulled her to him.\n\nHis song, he realized, was insidious in its power. He had thought only\nto entertain her with his music, but he was seducing her. Her head\nrested on his shoulder, her eyes closed. Her fingers crept slowly,\ndelicately, across the back of his neck under his hair, sending thrills\ndown his spine. He could not move away from her.\n\n\"Stop,\" he whispered. \"Please stop.\"\n\n\"Are you afraid of me?\" she asked softly.\n\n\"I am afraid for both of us. You do not know what a raging fire a lovely\nwoman like you can kindle in a man like me.\"\n\nShe withdrew her hand from his neck and let it rest on his thigh. That,\nhe thought, made it even more difficult for him.\n\n\"I must tell you something,\" she said. \"I am not--wholly innocent.\"\n\nHis heart felt a sudden chill. How could this dear creature be anything\nbut innocent?\n\nNow her hands were in her lap and her eyes were cast down. \"As you\nsurely know, most women past twenty, unless they are nuns, have been\nmarried for years. You must have wondered what I am doing in Orvieto,\nunmarried, living with my uncle.\"\n\n\"I never thought about it.\"\n\n\"Then _you_ are very innocent.\"\n\nSimon felt himself wilt inwardly. How could he have been so blind as not\nto wonder why Sophia was not married? She had seemed timeless to him and\nattached to no one. Even her relation to the cardinal, except that it\nput her in the enemy camp, seemed unimportant.\n\n\"You have a husband?\" His voice was heavy with sorrow. Foolish as it\nwas, he had dreamed that she might be virginal. But that made no sense,\nnow that he considered it. The rule in courtly love was to fall in love\nwith a lady who was married to someone else. His Parisian courtly lovers\nhad been married women. If Sophia were already married, that should make\nit better.\n\nThen why did he feel so disappointed?\n\n\"I was married at fourteen. His name was Alessandro. He died two years\nlater of the damned fever that takes so many of our good Sicilian\npeople. He was very kind to me, and I was inconsolable.\"\n\n\"Ah. You are still in mourning for him?\"\n\nShe turned her hands over, showing empty palms. \"I loved him so much\nthat I could not think of marrying another man in Siracusa. At length my\nmother and father decided to send me to live with my uncle in the hope\nthat I could forget Alessandro enough to consider marrying again.\"\n\n\"Do you wish to marry again?\"\n\n\"I have met no one I am drawn to but you, Simon, and marriage between\nyou and me would be unthinkable. My family's station is so far beneath\nyours.\"\n\nHis heart leapt happily. She was free, yet, as she said, not wholly\ninnocent. He need not feel quite so guilty about the passionate thoughts\nhe had been having about her. And as for marriage between them being\nunthinkable, she did not know that none of the great houses of France\nwould consider a daughter of theirs taking the name de Gobignon. Her\nnonclerical family might be of low station, just as the pope's father\nhad been a shoemaker, but Sophia was the niece of a cardinal, a prince\nof the Church.\n\nIt was love, not thoughts of marriage, that had brought him here\ntonight. Still, he must respect her honorable widowhood. Since she had\nloved her husband, she might be more susceptible to him, and he must\nguard her virtue all the more steadfastly. Perhaps she thought that he\nrespected her less as a widow. He must reassure her.\n\nShe was not holding him any longer. He could stand up without tearing\nhimself away from her. He sprang to his feet and strode to the center of\nthe room.\n\n\"Believe me, I think you just as pure as if you had never been married\nat all.\"\n\nShe looked up at him, surprised, her hands still folded in her lap, her\ndark eyes wide.\n\n\"I am delighted to hear that. But\"--she cast her eyes down and smiled\nfaintly--\"does that mean there is to be nothing at all between us?\"\n\n\"I love you!\" Simon declared. \"I will always love you. I think of you\nnight and day. I beg you to love me in return.\"\n\n\"Oh, Simon. How beautiful.\" She held out her arms to him. But he stayed\nwhere he was and raised his hands warningly.\n\n\"I mean to love you according to the commandments of l'amour courtois.\nWith every fiber of my being I yearn to be altogether yours, but you\nmust restrain me.\"\n\n\"I must?\"\n\n\"You must be what the poets of old Languedoc called 'mi dons'--my lord.\nYou must rule me. One day we will join together in body, but only after\nI have been tested and found worthy.\"\n\n\"Is that what courtly love means?\"\n\n\"Yes, and that is why it is more beautiful than marriage. Husband and\nwife may embrace carnally the moment the priest says the words over\nthem. No, they are _required_ to. Courtly lovers know each other only\nwhen love has fully prepared the way, so that their coming together may\nbe a moment of perfect beauty.\"\n\nSophia looked at him silently. Her face was suddenly unreadable.\n\n\"Do you understand?\" he asked after he had stood awhile gazing into her\nlustrous brown eyes. \"These ideas are perhaps new to you.\"\n\n\"The woman is ruler of the man?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nThe corners of her mouth quirked. \"Then what if I were to command you to\nget into this bed with me?\"\n\nHe was certain from her sly smile that she was joking. But he could\nthink of no clever answer. He considered what he had read, what he had\nbeen told, what he had done with other women. None of it helped. The\nwomen who fell into bed with him on the first tryst had not been serious\nabout love, nor had he been. In all the lore of l'amour courtois the\nwoman made the man wait--sometimes for years, sometimes for his entire\nlife--and the man was happy to wait, and that was all there was to it.\n\nThen he remembered something his mother had said, a secret so precious\nhe would never tell anyone, not even Sophia. Not even Friar Mathieu\nneeded to know it. But it guided Simon now.\n\n_The first time your father and I were alone together I wanted him then\nand there. But he was strong enough for both of us. It was a whole year\nbefore we possessed each other in body. And you came of that union._\n\n\"You will not command me so,\" he said with cheerful confidence.\n\nHer eyebrows rose--they were strong and dark, like a raven's wings.\n\"Indeed?\"\n\n\"Because you know how much better it would be to wait. We both want each\nother now. But if we restrain that hunger, it will grow. It will be not\njust a desire of the flesh, but a longing of the spirit. It is said that\nthe souls in paradise know no greater happiness than two lovers do, who\nare united in soul as well as body.\"\n\n\"Prodigioso,\" she said. \"But I am just a Sicilian girl, and I do not\nperhaps have the refined spiritual appetite of a French nobleman. What\nif I cannot wait?\"\n\n\"It is natural,\" Simon said, thinking again of what his mother had\nconfided to him. \"Then I must be strong enough for both of us.\"\n\nThe thought of her powerful passions, which she restrained with such\ndifficulty, excited him. Holding himself back from her was going to be\npainful, but delightfully so. And think of the ecstasy when at last they\nwere united.\n\nSophia released a long sigh and brought the palms of her hands down on\nher knees with a slap of finality. \"So be it, Simon. You will teach me\nthe ways of courtly love, and I will do my best to be your--what did you\ncall it?\"\n\n\"Mi dons. My lord.\"\n\nHer teeth flashed white in the candlelight, and her lips glistened.\nSimon's own lips burned to taste hers.\n\n\"How strange. As if I were the man. Ah, but you are very much a man,\nSimon, and you make me feel very much a maiden.\"\n\nSimon turned and went to the window. The night air blew through the\ngauze curtains, and he felt a wonderful aliveness all over his body. He\nwondered whether Alain, out there in the dark somewhere, could see him\nhere in the window. He pushed the curtain aside so Alain, if he was\nthere, could get a good look and know that his seigneur was safe and\nhappy.\n\nDawn must still be hours away. What would he tell Alain about what\ntranspired this night? The truth, assuredly. But would Alain believe\nhim? And if he did, would he mock Simon for not bedding Sophia?\n\nNo, Alain would understand. He respected the good in men and women as\nmuch as Simon did. Which was why they were friends as well as lord and\nvassal.\n\nSophia stood beside him and put her hand on his shoulder.\n\n\"You cannot stand there all night, Simon. Come back and sit down.\"\n\nHe bowed. \"As mi dons commands.\" He let her take his hand and draw him\naway from the window.\n\nThere was one chair in the room, and he took it. Foolish to expose\nhimself to temptation by sitting beside her on the bed again. The chair\nwas straight, with a tall back and no arms. The only touch of comfort in\nits rectilinear shape was a cushion laid upon its seat. Sophia smiled\nand shrugged and sat again on her bed.\n\nWould she let him spend the night? Whenever he had been all night with a\nwoman, they had made love. Should he sing to her again? Would she want\nto sleep? He pictured himself watching over her while she slept, perhaps\nkneeling by her bedside, and the beauty of it thrilled him.\n\nNow he remembered something she had said earlier, that he had accused\nher of kissing him _only to further my uncle's plots against the\nTartars_. She was aware, then, of what Ugolini was doing.\n\n_She has no idea how much she revealed to me._\n\nHe sang another troubadour song, \"White Hands.\" She let him draw off her\nred silk slippers, and he almost cast away all his promises to himself\nas she curled her toes against the palm of his hand. He forced himself\nto stand up and pace the room while she lounged back on her bed, her\nhead propped up on her elbow, watching him with that delicious smile of\nhers.\n\nShe questioned him about his life, and he offered her a simple version\nof it, telling her nothing about his secret illegitimacy and the\ndishonor of the man whose name he bore. It struck him while talking to\nher that perhaps these two sins that had shaped his life--Amalric de\nGobignon's treason and Nicolette de Gobignon's adultery--had given him\nthe strength to resist the temptation to assail Sophia's virtue. He told\nher how he had spent much of his youth in the household of the King of\nFrance and how this had led to Count Charles d'Anjou's giving him the\ntask of protecting the Tartar ambassadors.\n\nAnd thus, inevitably, their talk got around to the Tartars.\n\n\"Why did you accept this task from the Count of Anjou?\" she asked. \"You\nhave a lofty title, huge estates, everything you could want. Why trouble\nyourself with all this intrigue?\"\n\nHaving decided not to tell her the truth about his past, Simon now could\nnot answer her question both honestly and fully. He could not say that\nhe had committed himself to this mission to clear the stain of treason\nfrom the name of de Gobignon and to prove that he had a right to the\ntitle.\n\nSo he told her of another reason, equally true.\n\n\"I am in part an orphan, and the king was like a second father to me. It\nis his wish that Christians and Tartars join together to liberate the\nHoly Land. And I would do anything for him.\"\n\nSophia frowned. \"I find that hard to understand. As for me, I hate the\nTartars.\"\n\nSimon's mind pounced on that. Could she be more involved in Ugolini's\nscheming than she had admitted?\n\n\"Why do you hate the Tartars? You know so little about them.\"\n\n\"I know that they almost made enemies of us because you thought I was\nkissing you just to help my uncle.\"\n\n_Walk carefully, Simon._\n\nAgain she was hinting at her uncle's involvement in all that had gone\nwrong for the alliance. But if he asked her about it outright, she might\nthink--as he had thought of her--that he was courting her only to\nfurther his cause.\n\n\"Well, I am sure your uncle is following his conscience, as we all are,\"\nsaid Simon. Actually, he believed nothing of the kind. But he did not\nwant to offend Sophia, and perhaps l'amour courtois would permit a small\nlapse in one bound to be truthful to his lady.\n\n\"And your conscience tells you to guard those savages?\"\n\n\"I want to see Jerusalem liberated and the Saracens conquered,\" Simon\nsaid. \"Every good Christian does.\"\n\nShe sat up in bed, looking at him earnestly. \"Do you not fear that the\nTartars are worse than the Saracens? That is what my uncle says.\"\n\nStep by step, as if he were defending a philosophical proposition at the\nUniversity of Paris, Simon explained to her what he believed. Yes, the\nTartars were barbarians and had committed unspeakable atrocities. But\nthe Saracens, united under the Mameluke Sultan of Egypt, were more\npowerful now than they had been in hundreds of years. If not stopped\nnow, they would sweep all the crusaders out of Outremer, the land beyond\nthe sea.\n\nAnd a wave of Mohammedan conquests might well not end there. To this day\nthe Moors were a power in Spain, and it was not that long ago that there\nwere Saracens in France and here in Italy. Surely she remembered that\nher own island of Sicily had been conquered for a time by the Saracens.\nIndeed, King Manfred von Hohenstaufen's army was made up partly of\nSaracens, and he himself was an infidel.\n\nWith their belief in spreading their religion by the sword, the Saracens\nwere a far greater danger to Christendom than the Tartars. The Tartars\nwere simple pagans, easily converted to Christianity. Friar Mathieu had\npersonally baptized over a dozen high-ranking Tartars.\n\nShe listened intently, her golden-brown eyes so fixed on his that he\nfeared more than once to lose his train of thought. But he persevered to\nthe end. When he finished, she nodded thoughtfully.\n\nNow, he thought, he could turn the conversation to her uncle.\n\n\"All this is so obvious,\" he said, \"it is hard to understand why your\nuncle should have formed a party to oppose the alliance.\"\n\nShe touched her fingertips to her mouth in surprise. That mouth--it was\nlike a blooming rose.\n\n\"You mean my uncle is the _leader_ of those who are against the\nalliance?\"\n\nThis reminded him of mornings he had tiptoed through his forest at\nGobignon, longbow drawn, catching a glimpse of a stag's brown coat and\nthen losing sight of it again in the thick broussailles, trying to stay\ndownwind and draw close enough for a good shot without frightening the\ndeer into headlong flight.\n\n\"But I thought you already knew that,\" he said. If she denied that she\nknew any such thing, then his quarry had escaped him.\n\n\"So, he put David of Trebizond up to baiting the Tartars while you and I\nwere so delightfully engaged? Wicked uncle! To think I almost lost you\non his account.\" She clenched a pretty fist that looked as if it had\nbeen chiseled in marble. On one finger her small garnet ring glittered\nin the candlelight.\n\n\"I believe he brought David of Trebizond and his servant Giancarlo here\nto Orvieto, as well as that Hungarian knight, Sire Cosmas, who spoke at\nthe pope's council, to discredit the Tartars.\" Simon wondered whether he\nshould tell Sophia about the bravos Giancarlo was recruiting. No, if he\ntold her what he knew about them, he would have to require her to keep\nit a secret, and that might make her feel disloyal to Ugolini.\n\nShe nodded. \"Now I understand why he spends so much time closeted with\nthat silk merchant, talking about--who is Fra Tomasso di--di--?\"\n\n_God's robe!_\n\n\"Fra Tomasso d'Aquino?\"\n\nShe nodded. \"That was the name. He sent David to see this Fra Tomasso,\nand when David came back I overheard my uncle joyfully shouting, 'Fra\nTomasso is with us!' over and over again. Is he an important man, this\nFra Tomasso?\"\n\nSimon tried to keep his face calm, but he was horrified. Simon recalled\nnow that the d'Aquino family were from southern Italy, the kingdom of\nManfred the unbeliever, as was Ugolini. And were not the d'Aquinos even\nrelated to the Hohenstaufens? Something must be done about this at once.\nHow far had the plotters--that was what they were, plotters--gotten with\nd'Aquino?\n\nHow much further dare he pursue this subject before Sophia grew\nsuspicious of him? And how much further before he began to feel that he\nwas degrading their love?\n\n_Our love? But she has not said she loves me._\n\nThe realization was like a thunderclap in his mind.\n\nWhat he really wanted to know was whether she loved him or not. To come\nright out and ask her was not the way of courtly love. He must wait for\nher to say. But she would never speak of love as long as they went on\nabout the Tartars and Ugolini.\n\n_To the devil with Ugolini and David of Trebizond and Fra Tomasso and\nthe Tartars!_\n\nHe had learned enough anyway, he decided. She had confirmed his\nsuspicion that Ugolini was the ringleader of the forces in Orvieto\narrayed against the Tartars. She had let him know that they had drawn\nFra Tomasso d'Aquino into their conspiracy.\n\nOf one thing he felt certain. If she were working with her uncle to\nblock the alliance, she would not have let him learn so much.\n\n\n\n\nXXXIII\n\n\nA hand shook Simon's shoulder. His whole right side ached. He fought\nwakefulness, trying to plunge deeper into sleep. He was in a cool blue\nlake surrounded by dark masses of spruce. He had just seen a wolf with a\nsilver-white coat drinking from the lake on the opposite shore and he\nwas trying to swim to it.\n\n\"Simon. You must wake up.\"\n\nHe opened his eyes. Right before his face was a twisting streak of\norange against a royal blue background, and he realized he was lying on\nhis side on the Persian carpet in Sophia's bedchamber. He rolled over on\nhis back and rubbed his aching side. He saw Sophia's face just above\nhim.\n\nHe could not help himself. He reached up with both arms and pulled her\ndown to him and kissed her. Her lips felt cool and dry, and he had a\nsudden fear that his breath must be sour from sleep. She pushed herself\naway from him and he did not try to hold her.\n\n\"There is light coming through the window, and I hear birds singing,\"\nshe said. \"You must go now. Many of my uncle's servants get up at dawn.\"\n\nHe sat up. She was kneeling beside him, still wearing the same\ncream-colored gown. He remembered now that they had talked of courtly\nlove, and a little about her childhood in Sicily. To his disappointment,\nshe had not said that she loved him.\n\nThe necessities of nature had forced on them an intimacy of one\nsort--while each had pretended not to notice, the other had used the\nchamber pot discreetly placed behind the red and green diamonds of a\nscreen.\n\nShe had been the first to fall asleep. Sleep had overtaken him, too, but\neach time he dozed off he started to topple off the small straight chair\nhe was sitting on. The fourth or fifth time this had happened he gave up\nsitting and stretched out on the carpet.\n\n\"Quickly, Simon, please. If my uncle ever finds out you were here, he\nwill send me back to Siracusa.\"\n\n_God forfend!_ The habits of his knightly training took over, and he\nstrode quickly to the corner, where he had left his sword and belt\nleaning against the wall, and buckled them on.\n\nHe remembered that Alain was supposed to sing an aubade, a dawn song, in\nthe street below to warn and rouse him. An old troubadour custom.\nPerhaps he had sung, and Simon, sleeping so soundly, had not heard.\n\n\"Did you hear anyone singing out in the street?\" he asked.\n\nSophia smiled and shook her head.\n\n_Blast Alain. He must have overslept, too._\n\nSophia said, \"But how will you get out of here? It is not as easy to\nclimb up to the roof as it is to climb down from it.\"\n\nSimon went to the window and pushed the curtain aside. The rope he had\nclimbed down on was still dangling from above. He gave it a hard pull,\nand it held firm. He looked up at the sky. It was a deep violet with\nonly a few faint stars and one brightly shining planet.\n\n_The morning star might be Venus, a good omen for a lover._\n\nHis heart was light, even though he was leaving Sophia. It had been a\nbeautiful night.\n\nA half-filled cup of wine stood on the table by her bed. He swigged it\nto rinse his mouth, swallowed, then wiped his lips with the back of his\nhand. He tried to think of some parting word worthy of a troubadour, but\nnone occurred to him.\n\nShe stood by the bed, her eyes warm. He held out his arms and she\nslipped into them with as much ease as if they had been lovers for\nyears. She was so much shorter than he that he had to lean down to kiss\nher, and as he did she arched her body against him.\n\n\"I love you,\" he whispered, embarrassed by its prosaic simplicity. But\nit was simple truth.\n\n\"And I love you.\" She kissed him quickly on the lips and turned away.\n\nHer words stunned him. He felt for a moment as if he were going to fall\ndead on the spot. And that if he did, it would be a perfect moment to\ndie.\n\nThe candles were almost burned to the bottom. He looked over at the\npainting of Saint Simon Stylites, whose blue eyes seemed to gleam out at\nhim from the shadows.\n\nHe wrapped the rope around both arms, gave it another yank to be sure it\nwas tied tightly above, and stepped up on the windowsill. He swung\naround so that he was facing the wall of the mansion and began to climb,\nhis joy at her parting words making him feel stronger and more agile.\nHis hands gripped the rough rope; his feet in calfskin boots pressed\nagainst the wall, pointed toes seeking out cracks. He did not look at\nthe stone-paved street three stories below.\n\nHe heard voices in the street--and froze. There were men gathered down\nthere. If they looked up, they would see him climbing up the front of\nthe cardinal's mansion.\n\n_Move quickly_, he told himself. He scrambled up to the square Guelfo\nmerlon around which his rope was tied, pulled himself over the parapet,\nand dropped with relief to the flagstones of the flat roof.\n\nHe untied the rope. Curiosity made him want to look at the men whose\nraised voices he heard coming from across the street. Something had\ndisturbed them. But he had the feeling that if he did not look at them,\nthey would not see him.\n\n_Hurry._ Holding the loosely coiled rope in one gloved hand, he ran as\nlightly as he could so as not to disturb anyone in the rooms below him.\n\nHe came to the back of the building, where, two stories below him, a\ncrenelated lower wall protecting the courtyard joined the main building.\nHe uncoiled the rope, found its center, and doubled the line around an\nangled merlon at the corner of the roof battlements so that both halves\ndangled down just above the courtyard wall. Then, gripping the doubled\nrope, he swung himself out and began to climb down.\n\nA thunderous roar battered at his ears. He saw in the courtyard a big\ngray hound racing over the paving stones twice as fast as any man could\nrun. It kept up a furious, enraged barking in a deep, bone-chilling\nvoice. In an instant the dog was below him. Its bellowing was sure to\nrouse the cardinal's guards. Its huge, pointed white teeth glistened;\nits tail lashed from side to side.\n\n_If I fell, that damned dog would eat me alive._\n\nHe remembered seeing the dog before with Giancarlo, David of Trebizond's\nservant. It had been friendly enough that day. But now it saw him as an\nintruder.\n\n_Giancarlo called it by name. What the devil was it? If I could speak\nits name, maybe I could get it to shut up._\n\nSimon stood on the courtyard wall, thankful that it was too high for the\ndog to reach him. The hound sprang at the top of the wall, at the same\ntime emitting a bark so loud it almost knocked Simon off his perch.\n\nSimon pulled on one end of the rope, and it snaked around the merlon and\ncame rippling down to him. To his horror, one end fell past him into the\ncourtyard.\n\nIn an instant those great ivory fangs had sunk into the braided hemp.\nSimon yanked on the rope, but there was no tearing it loose. Hoping to\ncatch the dog by surprise, Simon gave the rope some slack and then\njerked with all his might, but succeeded only in dragging the beast a\nfoot or so, claws scraping on cobblestones. At least the animal could\nnot bite the rope and bark at the same time. Enraged, muffled growls\nissued around its clenched teeth. It snapped its head from side to side,\ntrying to tear the rope out of Simon's hands.\n\nHe cut part of the rope away with his dagger, letting the end the dog\nheld fall into the courtyard. Even as he was coiling up the rest of the\nrope, the beast gave a howl of fury and with a tremendous leap was\nhalfway up the wall.\n\nThe remaining rope tied to his belt, Simon hung by his hands on the\noutside of the wall and let himself drop, hitting the stone street with\na thud that sent jolts of pain through his shinbones. He heard shouts on\nthe other side of the wall mingling with the roars of the hound.\n\nLimping a little at first from the force of the drop, he staggered into\nthe nearest side street. He would have to circle back to the avenue that\nran in front of the cardinal's palace, approaching it from another\ndirection.\n\nIt seemed to take hours for him to find his way through the snake's nest\nof byways. But he felt not the least bit disturbed. It did not matter.\nNothing mattered, because Sophia's parting words to him had been _And I\nlove you_. He felt like dancing through the crooked streets.\n\nBy the time he emerged near the east side of the cardinal's palace, he\ncould see quite clearly. There was no sun, though. The morning was damp\nand gray. He would have to cross the avenue and walk back past the\ncardinal's mansion to find the inn he and Alain had picked for their\nrendezvous. It must be near where that crowd of men had formed a circle\naround something.\n\n\"Are you the watch, Messere?\" a man said, coming up to him as he\napproached the crowd.\n\n\"I am not,\" said Simon with a slight haughtiness, and the man fell back,\neyeing Simon's rich clothing, sword and dagger.\n\n\"Scusi, Signore.\"\n\n_I really should not let myself be seen around here._\n\nWith deference to Simon's dress and manner, the crowd parted for him\nwhen he joined them to see what they were looking at.\n\nIt was the body of a dead man.\n\nIt was Alain.\n\nSimon staggered back, feeling as if he had been struck in the heart by a\nmailed fist.\n\n\"No!\" he cried.\n\n\"Do you know this man, Signore?\" someone asked him.\n\nSimon did not answer. He fell to his knees beside Alain, horrified by\nthe face so white it seemed carved from marble. He saw now the great\nbloodstain down the front of Alain's pale green tunic. Flies with\ngleaming blue-green bodies were humming above the bloodstain, settling\ndown again after Simon's arrival disturbed them.\n\nHe raised his head, and through the tears that clouded his vision he\nrecognized a face. Last night's innkeeper. A short, balding man with\nlarge eyes and a generous nose.\n\n\"We have sent for the watch, Your Signory,\" said the man.\n\n\"Did anyone see or hear anything?\"\n\n\"My wife heard your friend go out before dawn. He never came back.\"\n\n_Jesus, have mercy on me_, thought Simon. _This is my fault. He went out\nto await the dawn so he could warn me. And someone killed him._ Tears\nwere pouring from his eyes. He was sobbing convulsively.\n\n\"Poverello,\" he heard someone mutter sympathetically. Here he was a\nknight, a count, kneeling in the street weeping in front of a crowd of\nstrangers. He did not care.\n\nGuilt crushed him. He wanted to lie beside his friend's body and be dead\nwith him. But how could he? No, he had to find and kill Alain's\nmurderer.\n\nStill kneeling beside Alain, he wiped his face with the edge of his cape\nand surveyed the crowd. To keep his identity a secret seemed unimportant\nnow.\n\n\"I am the Count de Gobignon of France. I will pay handsomely anyone who\nhelps me find the man who did this. If anyone can name the murderer, I\nwill pay\"--he thought a moment--\"a thousand florins.\"\n\nA murmuring ran through the crowd. A fortune! Foolish, perhaps, Simon\nthought, to offer such a reward. A man would accuse his own brother to\nget that much money.\n\n_I may hear many names. I will have to be sure._\n\nHe looked down at poor Alain. The flies were crawling on his face, and\nhe brushed them away. Alain's lips had turned blue. He looked for\nAlain's purse and saw none on his belt.\n\nStabbed to death for the few coins he carried. Dead at twenty years of\nage. Tears overflowed his eyes again.\n\nOddly, Alain still wore his sword and dagger.\n\nAlain's weapons were still both sheathed. Whoever had stabbed him had\nnot given him time to defend himself. Yet, there were no recessed\ndoorways or alley openings where an armed robber might hide himself.\n\nThe spot was unpleasantly familiar. This was where Simon's archers, at\nde Verceuil's orders, had shot two Orvietans.\n\nHad Alain been tricked by someone pretending to be a friend? Was the\nkiller someone Alain knew?\n\n_Ah, my poor friend, what a shame it is when a young knight dies without\nsword in hand._ Simon clenched his fist, the tears falling unceasingly.\n_By the wounds in Christ's body I swear I will avenge the wounds that\nkilled you, Alain._\n\nSimon remembered now that the watch was on the way. When they got here\nthey would ask him questions about what he and Alain were doing here,\nquestions he did not want to answer until he had time to think.\n\n_A scandal would give de Verceuil a chance to eat me alive. And I must\nget Friar Mathieu to help me._\n\n\"Send someone to the Palazzo Monaldeschi for my horse,\" he said to the\ninnkeeper, standing suddenly.\n\n\"As you wish, Your Signory.\" The innkeeper hurried off.\n\nSimon swept the crowd with his gaze. \"Remember, all of you. Anyone who\nsaw anything, heard anything. You will be paid. Come to the Palazzo\nMonaldeschi.\"\n\nSimon sat down on the stone street to wait for the horse. Silently the\ncrowd that had gathered waited with him.\n\nWhen the innkeeper's servant brought the horse, Simon lifted Alain's\nbody with the help of two other men and lashed it securely facedown over\nhis horse's back with the rope he had used to climb to Sophia's room.\n\n_Sophia._ He had been so happy just moments ago because she said she\nloved him as they parted. Was she looking down now, seeing this pitiful\nsight?\n\nFresh sobs forced their way into his throat, and he leaned against his\nhorse, covering his face with his arms.\n\n_I have to get away from here quickly._\n\nHe forced himself to stop crying and took hold of the reins. The\nOrvietans fell back as he led the horse up the street leading northward\nto the Monaldeschi palace. He felt warmth on his neck and looked up to\nsee the sun through a break in the clouds.\n\nAlain would never see the sun again.\n\n_Whoever did this to you, Alain, I will not rest until I have killed him\nwith my own hands._\n\n\n\n\nXXXIV\n\n\nSordello's face, looking as if hewn from granite by an indifferent\nsculptor, was gray with fatigue. His arms bound behind his back, he\nknelt before Daoud, wearing a tattered brown frieze robe Tilia had\nsomewhere found for him.\n\nDaoud sat once again on the former papal throne. Dressed in black\ncassocks and hoods that covered their faces, Lorenzo and five of Tilia's\nblack servants stood along the walls of the room. Every so often\nSordello's eyes flickered to the implements of torture around the room\nand quickly away again.\n\nYet the night's assault on his mind had not altogether broken his\nspirit. \"If you think to frighten me with this clowning, think again,\nMesser David. I have stood undaunted before the Inquisition in my day,\nand they are a good deal more fearsome than you and your henchmen.\"\n\n_Leave him his shred of dignity_, Daoud thought. _A man who has lost\nthat is too dangerous._\n\n\"We are beyond fear now, Sordello, are we not?\"\n\nSordello's eyes glowed in the torchlight like a trapped animal's. \"What\nkind of devil are you?\"\n\nDaoud tried to smile kindly. \"You call me a devil after I have sent you\nto paradise?\"\n\nThe old bravo sighed, and his eyes closed. \"I did not know that my body\nwas capable of feeling so much pleasure. Even when I was twenty and at\nmy best, I never knew such delight. It shook me to the very root of my\nsoul.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Daoud. He was thinking back to his own initiation. Given\nsanctuary in Egypt, the Hashishiyya had built a tent-palace of wood and\nsilk west of El Kahira, at the foot of the pyramids. Over a series of\nmoonlit nights, Daoud had drunk the Old Man of the Mountain's brew. He\nhad entered hell in the bowels of the Great Pyramid and then had\nascended into paradise, where the houris promised by the Prophet had\nministered to him for what seemed an eternity. Yes, he knew very well\nwhat spirit-freezing delights Sordello had experienced.\n\n\"What are you, then?\" Sordello growled, his eyes flashing open. \"Some\nkind of stregone? What was that witches' potion you made me drink?\"\n\n\"Do you wish to return to paradise?\"\n\n\"You _are_ a devil, Maestro. You want my soul.\"\n\nThe man was quick, Daoud thought. For all that he was a flawed man, he\nhad a strong mind. He remembered being made to drink the preparation of\nwine and hashish. And he already realized why Daoud had done this to\nhim.\n\n_So delicate, this part._\n\nNow the bond must be forged. As a succession of Old Men of the Mountain\nhad forged it between themselves and their disciples in Alamut, in\nMasyaf, in all those mountain strongholds across Persia and Syria from\nwhich terror had gone forth for more than a hundred and fifty years.\n\n\"I am but a man like you, Sordello. I do not want your soul. I want your\nloyalty.\"\n\n\"You want my treachery, you mean. You want me to betray my master, the\nCount de Gobignon.\"\n\nThere was more than quickness here, Daoud thought. There was that\nfoolhardiness he had seen in Sordello before. A man of sense, knowing\nthat he was in the power of a force beyond his control, even beyond his\nunderstanding, would do nothing to antagonize that force. Yet Sordello\npersisted in challenging Daoud.\n\nAt the mention of Simon de Gobignon's name, Daoud's concentration\nwavered. When de Gobignon found his knight dead outside Ugolini's\nmansion, what would he do? There would be trouble over this, surely\nthere would be trouble. Daoud cursed himself for leaving Tilia's house\nand going back to the cardinal's mansion.\n\nHe forced his mind back to Sordello. How to work with this provoking\nspirit?\n\n\"To send you into the enemy camp as he did, Count Simon must have great\nconfidence in your ability.\"\n\nSordello laughed angrily. \"Confidence? That high and mighty French fop?\nHe was probably hoping you would catch me. Sia maledetto!\"\n\nHe curses de Gobignon. Excellent. Or is this merely for my benefit?\nDaoud peered at Sordello, wishing the room were lit by more than a few\ntorches burning in cressets. The flickering light was impressive, like\nthis gilded throne, but if Daoud could get closer to Sordello and see\nbetter, he could be more sure of what the man was really feeling.\n\nDaoud said, \"He who is loyal to me is never cast out, no matter how\nfoolishly he behaves.\"\n\n\"Does he who is loyal to you get to go to paradise often, Maestro?\"\nSordello's voice was thick with yearning.\n\nIt was time for the final step. Daoud beckoned. The nearest hooded\nfigure on his right, who was actually Lorenzo, came forward with a green\nearthenware cup. He bent and held it before the kneeling Sordello.\n\n\"More of your stregoneria? Or have you finally decided to poison me?\"\n\n\"Would I have showered you with wonders, as I have tonight, only to kill\nyou? No, I have one final wonder to show you. Drink, Sordello.\"\n\n_This wonder probably will be the death of you, but not for a while._\n\nAfter a long hesitation, the old bravo lifted his head and swallowed the\nliquid Lorenzo poured down his throat. He made a sour face. \"Paugh! It\ntastes bad!\"\n\nDaoud said nothing and waited. After a few moments of silence Sordello\nsat back on his heels. His gray head began to nod. His eyes closed.\n\nDaoud arose from the throne and went down to him, holding a candle in\none hand.\n\n\"Look at me, Sordello.\" The prisoner's head lifted, and his brown eyes\nstared fixedly into Daoud's. Daoud bent and passed the candle flame\nbefore Sordello's face, but his eyes remained motionless.\n\n\"Do you love Simon de Gobignon, or do you hate him?\"\n\n\"Hate. I hate him,\" Sordello said in a dull voice. \"I have suffered much\non his account.\"\n\n\"Would you kill him if you had the chance?\"\n\nEven in his trance Sordello's eyes seemed to glow, and his face flushed.\n\"Yes. Oh, yes, Maestro. Gladly.\"\n\nThat was good. The will must already be there. Then it remained only to\nshape the deed. Daoud reached inside the collar of his tunic and pulled\nout the silver locket Blossoming Reed had given him. It was, he had\ndecided, better than a word or combination of words. It was something\nSordello would never see again unless Daoud wished him to see it.\n\nHe dangled the locket by its chain before Sordello's face, letting it\nswing from side to side. He held the candle so its flame reflected from\nthe silver disk.\n\n\"Watch the locket, Sordello. Look closely at it. The design on its face\nis like no other in the world. Make certain that you would know it if\nyou saw it again.\"\n\nFor a time he let the locket swing, and Sordello's head turned from side\nto side, following it.\n\n\"Do you know this locket now, Sordello? Truly know it?\"\n\n\"Yes, Maestro.\"\n\n\"Could you mistake it for another?\"\n\n\"No, Maestro.\"\n\n\"Good. Now I command you. When you see this locket again, it will be a\nsign. It will mean that you are to kill Simon de Gobignon at once. As\nsoon as you see the locket, you will take up the first weapon that\ncomes to hand, and you will await your first good chance, and you will\nstrike him down. Do you understand?\"\n\n\"Yes, Maestro.\"\n\n\"Will you do it?\"\n\n\"Yes, Maestro. With much joy.\"\n\n\"Say what you will do, Sordello.\"\n\n\"When I see that locket, I will kill Simon de Gobignon at once.\"\n\n\"That is good. Now, in a little while you will wake up. And you will not\nremember anything I have said to you about the locket and about killing\nSimon de Gobignon. You will forget all about it until you see the locket\nagain. And then you will strike.\"\n\n\"Yes, Maestro.\"\n\nDaoud went back to the throne and sat down. He slipped the locket's\nchain over his head and dropped the silver disk back inside his tunic.\nSordello slumped in his kneeling posture like a figure of wax that had\nbeen placed too close to a fire.\n\nDaoud waited patiently, and in a few moments Sordello raised his head,\nhis eyes bloodshot but alert.\n\n\"Will you let me visit paradise again soon?\" His memory had gone back to\nthe moment before he drank the drug.\n\n\"Not _very_ soon,\" said Daoud. \"But serve me well, and it will happen\nagain.\" He could not make Sordello wait a year, as the Hashishiyya\nusually did with their initiates. But it must be a wait of some months,\nor the experience would lose its magic. And in months his work in\nOrvieto might be done.\n\n_And then again, I might still be here ten years from now._\n\n\"Tell me what I have to do, Maestro.\"\n\n\"Serve me faithfully, and from time to time, when it pleases me, you\nwill visit paradise. Disobey me or betray me--we will know instantly if\nyou do--and when you least expect it you will find yourself in hell. Not\nthe one we created for you last night. The real one.\"\n\n\"You don't need to threaten me,\" said Sordello with a flash of his old\nrebelliousness. \"Just tell me what you want.\"\n\n\"Simply go on doing what you have been doing. You will give the Count de\nGobignon information about us--but from now on we will tell you what to\ntell him. And you will keep me informed about the young count. Hardly\nany work at all, you see.\"\n\nSordello grunted. \"I doubt it will be that easy. But as long as you\noffer a reward so great, I am your man.\"\n\n_My slave_, thought Daoud, hoping that his pity for this creature did\nnot show in his face.\n\nBut he must remember that there were hidden places in this man's soul.\nAnd he had never before tried to enslave a man as the Hashishiyya did\nit. He could not be sure that he had succeeded fully, and so he had made\na creature potentially as dangerous to himself as to anyone else. The\nflesh on the back of his neck crawled.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe was sitting by the window, staring out at the spot on the street\nwhere the young man's body had lain. She heard the door open behind her.\nShe turned, and there was David. Golden-haired, lean, tall, with those\nlight-filled eyes. She forgot herself and felt a leap of love, and then\nher heart clenched like a fist with anger.\n\n_Wait, let him tell it before I judge him._\n\nHe closed the door slowly, a strange expression on his face. She looked\nfrom him to the image of the saint. Yes. The look around the eyes was\nthe same. They had accepted pain and sorrow, did not struggle against it\nas ordinary people did, and they knew _something_.\n\nExcept that David's eyes were not the bright blue of the saint's.\nDavid's eyes seemed to reflect whatever color was about him.\n\nHow could it be that the icon she had painted could remind her of two\nsuch different men as Simon de Gobignon and David of Trebizond?\n\nHe stood there looking at her, and she realized that he was waiting for\nher to speak. He wanted to know what she and Simon had done in this\nroom, and he did not want to ask. And she knew at that instant, watching\nhis face, that he was expecting to be hurt by what she would tell him\nabout herself and Simon.\n\n_But what about that young Frenchman in the street? I saw Simon kneel by\nhim, weep for him, bear him away._\n\n\"Something terrible has happened,\" she said.\n\nHis eyes narrowed. \"You did not succeed with de Gobignon?\"\n\n\"No, someone killed his friend, who was waiting for him, down there in\nthe street. Everything is ruined. Simon will not want to see me again.\nHe will be certain to blame me for that young man's death.\"\n\n\"Why should he?\" David walked over to the chest, where the enameled\ncandlesticks on either side of the painting of the saint still held\nburnt-out stumps of candles. He sat cross-legged on the floor in front\nof the chest. He rested his forearms on his knees and his gaze on the\nflame and azure carpet. There were deep lines in his face. He looked as\nif he had not slept all last night.\n\nHis face in front of the saint's face. Looking from one to the other,\nSophia saw the resemblance more plainly than ever.\n\nShe sighed and spoke with elaborate patience. \"What else can Simon think\nbut that his friend was killed by some overzealous protector of mine?\"\n\n\"Why would a protector kill a man standing in the street when there is\nanother man up in the bedroom with the woman he is supposed to protect?\"\nThere was something in the harshness of his gaze, a flatness in his\nsteel-colored eyes, that told her beyond the possibility of doubt that\nit was he who had killed Simon's young companion.\n\nBut had he not been at Tilia's house all night?\n\nShe nodded her head slowly. \"Simon will probably think that way, too.\"\n\nFrom his seat on the floor, David looked up at her with a hard smile.\n\"And, since I am certain you gave him incomparable pleasure in bed, he\nwill overcome any objections he has to seeing you again.\"\n\nShe felt as if he had stamped on her heart. To him she was nothing but a\nharlot to be used to ensnare his enemies.\n\nAnd if that was all _he_ thought she was, how could she find it possible\nto think any better of herself?\n\n_If I am not a whore, what am I?_\n\nBut she would tell him the truth whether or not he chose to believe it.\n\n\"Nothing happened between us,\" she said tonelessly.\n\nHe stared at the carpet. She saw hope struggling with doubt in his face.\n\nDoubt won. His smile was cynical.\n\n\"You failed to seduce him? I cannot believe that.\"\n\n\"Whatever you may believe, that was how it was.\"\n\n\"Why do you bother to lie to me?\" Anger smoldered in his face. His\ncheeks were reddening.\n\n\"Why _would_ I lie to you? It would make no difference to you if I went\nto bed with Simon.\"\n\n\"If, as you say, nothing happened, then explain to me why it did not.\"\nHe folded his arms and sat hunched forward.\n\n\"When a man like Simon is in love--\" she said, and stopped. \"You _do_\nunderstand what I mean by love?\" How did a man brought up in Egypt as a\nslave to Turks feel about women? Saracens, she knew, kept their many\nwives locked up most of the time.\n\nDaoud shrugged. \"I can only guess at what _you_ mean by love.\"\n\n\"A man like Simon shows his love by holding back his ardor. He does not\nrealize that I know this. I have let him think he is teaching me about\ncourtly love.\"\n\n\"And what did you learn by letting him woo you in this courtly way?\" He\nlooked pleased. He was beginning to believe her.\n\n\"He tried to find out things from me. He is such an innocent. He had no\nidea that I was telling him what you told me to tell him.\"\n\nDavid sighed, stood up, and walked to the window. She could see the\ntension in his back. How broad his shoulders were. Not huge, like those\nof some knights, but graceful and powerful. His posture was not just\nerect; it was perfect, straight yet flexible, like a blade of the finest\nsteel. She imagined him with his shirt off. The palms of her hands\ntingled at the thought of stroking his shoulders.\n\n\"Did you not want to take him into your bed?\" His voice was cold.\n\nShe thought back to her night with Simon. During those hours when she\nhad been Sophia Orfali, she had been disappointed when Simon insisted\nthat he would not touch her. But Sophia Orfali had to accept his\njudgment.\n\nEarlier, she had wanted to take Simon to bed as a kind of revenge on\nDavid for letting Rachel be used by the Tartar. But last night she had\nlet Simon decide what they would do. When she was with Simon, she was\nwhat Simon wanted her to be.\n\n_Is that what I am, a woman who becomes whatever the man she is with\nwishes?_\n\nShe expelled her breath in a short, sharp sigh.\n\n\"I wanted to do whatever was necessary. If it had been necessary to make\nlove to him, I would have done it.\"\n\nShe shut her eyes momentarily. Her head spun. Now, with David here, she\nwanted David, not Simon. And she hated herself for wanting him, when he\nsaw her as no more than a useful object, as Manfred had.\n\n_If only Alexis had lived. These loves I feel for men, for Manfred, for\nSimon, for David. I cannot help myself, and it betrays me. It divides me\nagainst myself. And they do not return my love._\n\nAnd yet, she was sure David did care for her, perhaps even loved her,\nthough he would never admit it. Why else this jealous questioning?\n\n_That might even have been why he killed Simon's friend!_\n\nThe thought made her heart stop beating for an instant and her body turn\ncold. Killing Simon would have upset David's plans, but he might have\ntaken out his jealous rage on Simon's friend.\n\n\"But what did you _want_ to do with de Gobignon?\" he demanded, turning\nfrom the window.\n\nHe would not let it alone. She slid off the bed and got to her feet. She\nwent to the chest and stood with her back to David, staring at the\npicture of the saint. Anger clouded over her vision so that she could\nnot see the painting. She clasped her hands together to control their\ntrembling.\n\n\"I do not have to tell you that,\" she said in a choked voice. \"It does\nnot matter. I do what is necessary.\"\n\n\"As I do!\" There was a snarl in his voice.\n\nWhat did he mean by that, she wondered. She turned and the look she saw\non his face made her stomach knot itself. His teeth were bared and his\neyes were narrowed to glowing slits.\n\nNow she had to hear him say it. \"Did you kill that boy?\"\n\nShe watched him slowly regain command of himself. Calm returned to the\nhard, tan features. His eyes held hers, and their color seemed to change\nfrom white-hot to the cold gray of iron.\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\nShe felt something break inside her. Grief overwhelmed her. She mourned\nfor the young Frenchman. She did not know the man David had killed, but\nshe imagined him to be just like Simon. She wept for him and for Simon.\nAnd for David. She did not want to cry, but she could not help herself.\nShe walked slowly to her bed and sat down heavily. She could feel the\ntears running down her cheeks.\n\n\"Why did you kill him?\"\n\n\"I had to leave Tilia's. I made the mistake of coming back here. From\nacross the street I saw de Gobignon in this window.\" His voice was\ntight, his words clipped, as if he were trying to hold something in. \"At\nthe same time, the Frank, who was on watch, saw me. If I had allowed him\nto live, de Gobignon would have known that I approved of his being with\nyou. And he was no boy, but a knight, strong and trained.\"\n\n\"He could have been no match for you.\"\n\n\"I gave him no chance to match himself against me. This is not some\ntournament. Your life is in as much danger as mine is.\"\n\n\"I never forget that,\" she said.\n\nDavid had killed Simon's friend. She wished that she had gone to bed\nwith Simon.\n\n\"Do you think de Gobignon will now be afraid to try to see you again?\"\nThere was a sneer in David's voice, and she felt the heated blood rising\nto her face.\n\n\"He is no coward.\"\n\nHe looked at her with weary eyes and a tight little smile. \"Well, then.\nHe will want to see you again. Send a message to him. Have him meet you\nsomeplace other than here. Someplace where he will feel safe. A church,\nperhaps.\"\n\n\"A church. Yes, that is a good suggestion. Then you will not have to\nwonder what we are doing.\"\n\n\"From what I have heard of Christian churches, that is not necessarily\ntrue.\"\n\nShe wished she had the skull to throw at him again. That was all that\npoor young knight would soon be--a skull, buried in the earth.\n\n\"How dare you insult the religion you were born into?\" she shouted.\n\"Have you forgotten that I am a Christian?\"\n\nHe glared at her, turned on his heel, and slammed the door behind him.\n\nFeeling alone, unloved, and desolate, not even sure who she was, Sophia\nsat heavily on her bed. Sobs racked her chest, one after the other. Not\nwilling to admit how much Daoud had hurt her, she struggled with her\ntears for a time, then gave in and threw herself full length on the bed,\npain spreading through her body.\n\n\n\n\nXXXV\n\n\n\"Is it not a sin, Father, to explore a man's body like that?\"\n\n\"It is considered a crime in many places. But it is not a sin when it is\ndone with reverence, to discover the truth.\"\n\nWatching Friar Mathieu, Simon felt his stomach rebel. The old priest\nbent over the long naked form of Alain de Pirenne, stretched out on\nSimon's bed, wielding a freshly sharpened carving knife borrowed from\nthe Monaldeschi kitchen. The knife flashed in the light of the many\ncandles set around the bed as Friar Mathieu enlarged the wound in\nAlain's belly. Simon kept looking away and then staring back,\nfascinated.\n\n\"It hurts me to see you treat Alain so,\" said Simon. \"Though I know you\nmean to do good.\"\n\n\"My brother Franciscan, Friar Roger of Oxford, says that if you want to\nknow God, you must look as closely as possible at His works. He says\nthat to read the book of God's creation is better than reading\nphilosophy, and is a form of prayer.\"\n\n\"Philosophy. Yes,\" said Simon. \"I learned last night that Fra Tomasso\nd'Aquino is an enemy.\"\n\n\"One moment.\" Friar Mathieu had tripled the width of the lower wound and\nwas now pulling the lips of the gash apart, peering intently into it. If\nAlain had been alive, Simon knew, blood would have been pouring out of\nthat incision.\n\nSickened, Simon turned away. He wondered if he could sleep again in this\nbed, knowing that Alain's poor naked body had been stretched out there,\nto be tormented in death by this old Franciscan physician-priest.\n\nIf he abandoned the bed, he would have to give up the room, though, and\nit was one of the few private rooms in the Monaldeschi palace. It was a\nwarlike room, as befitted a young knight, decorated with battered\nMonaldeschi arms. Crossed halberds, spotted with rust, were hung on the\nstone chimney that ran up from the kitchen on the first floor. Shields,\ndented and scratched, each almost as tall as a man, faced each other\nfrom opposite walls. They were probably quite old, since they bore\nsimple blazons. The one on Simon's right was ocher, with a black chevron\ndividing it across the middle. The other bore an azure cross against a\nwhite background.\n\nThis being the top floor of the palace, the mullioned window was\nspacious, and Friar Mathieu had drawn back the curtains and pulled the\ntwin window frames inward on their hinges to get more light. Simon went\nto the window and looked through the protective iron grill down into the\nsquare. Two men and three horses were gathered by the steps leading to\nthe front door. They wore yellow and blue livery, the colors of the city\nof Orvieto.\n\n\"I think I have found something,\" said Friar Mathieu. Just as he\nfinished speaking, Simon's door shook under a heavy knock.\n\n\"Say nothing,\" said the Franciscan. \"I will tell you later.\"\n\nThe knock sounded again. Simon went to the door and opened it. A stocky\nman whose bald head came up to the middle of Simon's chest stood there.\nSimon observed that the man carried more muscle than fat on his sturdy,\nbarrel-shaped frame. He wore a yellow silk tunic trimmed with blue, and\na short sky-blue cape. A bright gold medallion on a gold chain hung from\nhis neck. Two daggers, one long and stout, the other short and slender,\nhung from the right side of his belt. The sword on his left side reached\nfrom his waist to his ankle. Simon knew he had seen him before, but he\ncould not remember where.\n\n\"Your Signory, Count de Gobignon, it is my honor to address you,\" the\nstout man said. His words were polite, but his tone was perfunctory. He\nhad to tilt his head back to look at Simon, but his voice and expression\nmade Simon feel very young and small. Even so, Simon held his silence\nand did not step aside to let the man in. Let him introduce himself\nfirst.\n\nAfter a pause, the man said, \"Your Signory, I am Frescobaldo d'Ucello,\npodesta of Orvieto.\" He stopped, eyeing Simon. He had sparkling black\neyes, and his black mustache was trimmed so that it was no more than a\nthin line above his mouth. Simon remembered now having seen this man,\nthe governor of the city, at the execution of that poor heretic a month\nago.\n\n\"Signore Podesta,\" Simon bowed. \"The honor is mine.\"\n\n\"Not at all, Your Signory.\" Now the stout man looked past Simon into the\nroom, and his eyebrows flew up. Simon turned and saw Friar Mathieu\nanointing Alain's brow with his oil-dipped thumb, forming a cross on the\nwhite forehead. Most of Alain's body was under an embroidered coverlet,\nand the kitchen knife had disappeared.\n\nD'Ucello blessed himself and said in a low voice, \"I will examine the\nbody after the good father is finished with the last rites. Would you be\nso kind as to step out of the room, Count, so that we can talk?\"\n\nClosing the door behind him, Simon followed d'Ucello through the\ncorridor out to the colonnaded galleria overlooking the lemon trees\nwhere he and Sophia had kissed on the night of the contessa's reception\nfor the Tartars.\n\nSo long ago that seemed now, though it was little more than a month, and\nso much tragedy had come of it.\n\nSimon told d'Ucello the story he had worked out, that he and Alain had\ngone to that inn searching for women and had gotten separated.\n\nThere were large bags under the podesta's eyes, dark as bruises. They\ncontracted as he listened to Simon.\n\n\"Forgive me, Your Signory, but I must be clear. Are you telling me that\nyou slept with a woman last night?\"\n\nSimon tried to look abashed and reluctant to speak. \"Yes.\"\n\n\"And where did this take place, Your Signory?\"\n\n\"In my private room at the inn.\"\n\n\"Who was she?\"\n\nSimon had prepared his answer. \"I do not know. A pleasant lady whom I\nmet in the common room.\"\n\nThe bags under d'Ucello's eyes twitched. \"There are no whores in that\npart of town, Signore. It is one of my duties to see that the\nprostitutes are limited to a quarter of the city where they will not\noffend the holy or the well-born. A cardinal has his residence across\nthe street from where your friend's body was found.\" D'Ucello's mouth\nstretched, but neither his eyes nor the dark bulges under them joined in\nthe smile. \"The woman who entertained you must have been an ordinarily\nrespectable person who chose to go astray that evening.\" He paused and\nlooked grimly up at Simon.\n\nSimon felt as if a clammy hand had taken him by the back of the neck. He\nshould have realized this vaguely imagined woman would not satisfy any\ndetermined questioner. He struck his fist against his leg. D'Ucello's\neyes flickered, and Simon knew he had caught the gesture. He felt as if\na net were slowly being drawn around him, and he resented it. Back home\nno mere city governor would dare trouble the Count de Gobignon any more\nthan he would disturb the king or one of his brothers.\n\nAs d'Ucello continued to stare silently at him, Simon studied the\npodesta. This was a man who was jealous of his power, Simon decided. A\nman who, despite his politeness, would enjoy embarrassing a young\nnobleman.\n\n\"What was the woman's name?\" d'Ucello pressed him.\n\n\"I have no idea.\"\n\nThe thick black eyebrows rose again, wrinkling the balding scalp. \"You\nspent the entire night with this woman and never called her by name?\"\n\nSimon had been intending to claim that honor forbade him to tell the\nwoman's name. He felt certain the governor would reject that argument as\ntrivial under the circumstances.\n\n\"We spoke very little. I addressed her with various foolish\nendearments.\"\n\n\"Could you describe her?\"\n\n\"Most of the time we were in the dark.\" Simon felt d'Ucello had pressed\nhim enough. It was time to fight back. \"Signore Podesta, my good friend\nand vassal was murdered in the street, a street supposedly under the\nprotection of your watch. I fail to see how it helps you to do your duty\nof finding his killer by questioning me as if I were a criminal.\"\n\nThe podesta's brows drew together, and he took a few steps backward,\ndiminishing the importance of the difference in height between him and\nSimon.\n\n\"Your Signory, I have questioned everyone who lives in that\nneighborhood, and everyone I could find who was passing through it last\nnight,\" he said. \"I learned from the innkeeper at the Vesuvio that your\nfriend slept alone last night. I know that you did not meet anyone in\nthe inn, woman or man. You stopped there briefly, left your friend, and\nwent somewhere else. You did not engage a private room for yourself. The\ninnkeeper and several other people agree to that. Will Your Signory be\ngood enough to tell me where you did go?\"\n\nSimon heard with dismay the weakness in his tone and was appalled at how\neasily d'Ucello had exposed his lies. \"Those you spoke to about what I\ndid must have been mistaken,\" he said. \"Perhaps they did not notice my\nreturn to the inn.\" An inspiration struck him. \"They may be trying to\nprotect the woman I was with.\"\n\nD'Ucello smiled thinly. \"I see. Then you are telling me that you had\ncarnal relations with this woman while your good friend and vassal\nlooked on.\"\n\nSimon was momentarily at a loss for words. It would have delighted him\nto reply by running d'Ucello through.\n\nThey stood bristling at each other like two hostile hounds when Simon\nheard a door open. A moment later, to his enormous relief, Friar Mathieu\njoined them by the marble railing overlooking the atrium.\n\n\"If you wish to examine young Sire de Pirenne's body, he lies in Count\nSimon's room waiting for you, Signore,\" said Friar Mathieu. \"This is a\nvery sad day for us.\"\n\nWith a black look at Simon, d'Ucello bowed to the old priest and left\nthe galleria.\n\nWhen they were alone, Friar Mathieu grunted. \"A good thing I merely\nextended the wounds Sire Alain had already suffered. The podesta might\nwell bring charges against me for desecrating a corpse if he saw I had\nmade incisions in the body.\"\n\n\"Did you learn anything?\" Simon asked.\n\n\"I am convinced that Sire Alain was not merely stabbed to death.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Simon was eager to get Friar Mathieu's advice on how\nto handle the podesta, but this was more important.\n\n\"When I looked closely at the wound in his stomach, I discovered that it\nwas two wounds,\" said Friar Mathieu. \"He was punctured there by a thin,\nround object, like a large needle. Then he was stabbed through the\nheart, and blood poured out of him. And then the killer stabbed him in\nthe belly to try to mask the dart wound.\"\n\n\"How do you know that?\"\n\n\"The belly wound did not bleed much, so the heart wound must have\npreceded it. When the killer drove his knife into the puncture in the\nbelly, it did not go in exactly the same direction. The smaller wound\ngoes upward at a slight angle, as if the needle were driven in from the\nlevel of the killer's waist. The knife wound goes straight in. I had to\ndig below the skin and ribs to discover the needle wound.\"\n\n\"A needle could not have killed Alain.\"\n\n\"It could have been a poisoned dart. Alain's lips are blue. That is\nsometimes a sign of poison.\"\n\nSimon heard a clumping of boots in the corridor. He hurried in from the\ngalleria to find Cardinal Paulus de Verceuil, accompanied by two\nblack-robed priests, striding toward the room where Alain lay.\n\n\"Now one of your knights has been killed!\" de Verceuil boomed. He was\ndressed in a dark cerise tunic with particolored hose and forest-green\nboots with pointed toes. The only indications of his ecclesiastical\noffice were the absence of a sword and the presence of the large jeweled\ncross hanging from his neck. A purple velvet cap adorned with a black\nfeather was draped over his glossy black hair.\n\nSimon told the cardinal he and Alain had been out late and had decided\nto stay at an inn rather than cross town during the dangerous night\nhours. Friar Mathieu came and stood beside him, greeting the two priests\nwho had accompanied de Verceuil. They loftily eyed the old Franciscan's\nbrown robe and responded with curt nods.\n\nWhen Simon finished his recital, de Verceuil leaned forward, his small\nlower lip outthrust. \"If you cannot protect your own knights, how can\nyou protect the emissaries from Tartary?\"\n\nThat was not a question but an assault, Simon decided, and required no\nanswer. \"We are doing everything we can to find his killer, Your\nEminence.\"\n\n\"By God's footprints, I wish this were my bishopric!\" de Verceuil\nexclaimed. \"I would take a dozen men from that neighborhood and I would\nhang one man a day until the killer was found. I would have the man.\"\n\nThe door to the room where Alain lay swung open, and the stout podesta\nemerged. He stood silently glowering up at de Verceuil. Simon wondered\nwhether d'Ucello had learned anything from looking at poor Alain's\ncorpse.\n\n\"And what, Your Eminence, if the people of that neighborhood truly do\nnot know who killed the Sire de Pirenne?\" said Friar Mathieu.\n\nUntil that moment Simon had assumed Alain had met his death at the hands\nof some Orvietan cutthroat. If not such a one, then who? He remembered\nGiancarlo and the bravos he had met on the road. Alain's money had been\ntaken, but not his weapons. And Giancarlo served David of Trebizond, and\nDavid served Ugolini. Was this Ugolini's way of protecting his niece's\nhonor?\n\nIf Giancarlo had anything to do with it, Sordello ought to be able to\nfind out.\n\n\"If we arrested all the men who live on the street where he was killed,\"\nsaid de Verceuil, \"more than likely among them would be the man who did\nit. These Italians--shopkeepers by day and robbers by night.\"\n\nThe faces of the two priests with him tightened. Simon glanced at\nd'Ucello, and saw a flush darkening his brown cheeks.\n\n\"The people of that street are among the most respectable in Orvieto,\nSignore,\" the podesta growled. How delightful, Simon thought, if the\nodious de Verceuil and the odious d'Ucello were to tear into each other.\n\nDe Verceuil stared at the podesta in amazement and wrath, while the two\npriests turned their heads from one to the other in embarrassment. After\na moment, one priest murmured de Verceuil's identity to d'Ucello, while\nthe other softly told the cardinal who the podesta was.\n\n\"Forgive me, Your Eminence, if my tone was less respectful than you\ndeserve,\" said d'Ucello, bowing to kiss de Verceuil's haughtily extended\nsapphire ring.\n\n\"I have encountered nothing but disrespect from Orvietans since I came\nhere,\" said the cardinal, and Simon remembered that vile smear of dung\non his cheek the day they arrived. \"I had actually thought Orvieto had\nno governor.\"\n\n\"Forgive me again that I did not pay my respects to you before,\" said\nd'Ucello. He did not rise to the bait, Simon noticed. An intelligent\nman.\n\n\"A French knight has been murdered in your city, Podesta,\" de Verceuil\nsaid. \"Regardless of your high opinion of the people of the quarter\nwhere it happened, I expect you to press them hard until you find the\nkiller. A thing like this cannot happen without someone seeing something\nor hearing something.\"\n\nThat reminded Simon that no one had come forward to claim the reward he\nhad offered. If someone had heard or seen something, that person was\ndoubtless too frightened to speak of it.\n\n\"Your Eminence gives me most valuable advice,\" said d'Ucello. \"I promise\nyou, we shall not rest until the killer is found.\" His round body bobbed\nforward in a bow, and he turned on his heel, sword and daggers swinging,\nand marched away.\n\n\"Pompous little man,\" said de Verceuil. \"And doubtless incompetent and\ntreacherous.\"\n\nThe cardinal turned to Simon now. \"Do not leave it to that watch\ncommander to find the killer. The knight--what was his name?\" Simon told\nhim. \"De Pirenne was your man, and you are responsible for his death.\nPut all the men under you to work hunting down the murderer. Do whatever\nhas to be done. We must not let the death of a French knight go\nunavenged.\"\n\n\"As Your Eminence wills, so I will,\" said Simon.\n\nDe Verceuil raised a finger. \"And we will have a splendid funeral. The\npope himself will be present. Let the grandeur of the ceremony show that\nwe French do not take the death of one of our number lightly. Let these\nsneaking Italians tremble before our wrath.\"\n\nAgain the two priests looked at each other, and one of them shrugged\nresignedly.\n\n_What barbarians we must seem to them._ Simon's face grew hot with\nembarrassment.\n\n\n\n\nXXXVI\n\n\n\"Canaglia! Give way or I will have your heart on a platter!\"\n\nHearing the shout, Simon stifled a curse and turned to see arms waving,\na man in helmet and leather chest armor fall back, pushed by another.\nThe man shouting and pushing was Peppino, one of Simon's Venetian\ncrossbowmen. The man Peppino had knocked down was Grigor, one of the\nTartars' bodyguards.\n\n_No, dear God, not today!_\n\nSunk in grief though he was, he would have to do something. For Alain.\nThat today of all days, the day of Alain's funeral, might not be marred\nby brawling.\n\nFrom his seat atop a black-caparisoned stallion in the gateway of the\nMonaldeschi courtyard, he looked down on a boiling mass of bright\nconical helmets, all of them now moving toward the action in the center\nof the yard. He kicked his horse's flanks and drove into the crowd. He\nhad to break up the fight before it started.\n\nThe Armenian was on his feet and reaching for his dagger. And Peppino\nhad his hand on the hilt of his own blade. Before Simon could reach\nthem, Teodoro, whom Simon had appointed capitano of the crossbowmen\nafter dismissing Sordello, forced his way between the two men. He turned\nhis back on the Armenian and gave Peppino a violent shove with both\nhands.\n\n\"Stupido! Back in line!\"\n\n\"What devil's work is this?\" Simon demanded.\n\nTeodoro turned and saluted Simon smartly. \"Your Signory, Peppino is a\nfool. But the Armenians provoked him. They insist on marching before us\nin the cortege. Are we not to march behind the French knights?\"\n\nIdiots! What difference did it make? They had forgotten that this parade\nwas for Alain; they thought it was for them. He felt a dull hatred for\nboth the Venetians and the Armenians.\n\nSimon sent for Ana, the multilingual Bulgarian woman, who translated for\nthe Armenians Simon's explanation that the French knights must ride as\nan honor guard directly behind Alain's bier, and that since the\nVenetians were directly under the command of the French, they must come\nnext. Also, no one must come between the Tartar ambassadors and their\nArmenian bodyguards; therefore the Venetians must precede the Armenians.\n\n\"Sergentes, get your men back into line!\" Simon shouted at the leaders\nof the hundred Monaldeschi men-at-arms milling about in the courtyard\nalong with the Venetians and the Armenians.\n\nSimon spurred his horse back to the head of the procession, where he\ntook his position just behind Alain's bier, which was already in the\nstreet.\n\nThe Sire de Pirenne lay upon a huge square of red samite edged with\ngold, draped over the flat bed of a four-wheeled cart. Red ribbons were\nwoven into the spokes of the wheels. The two farm horses that drew the\ncart, chosen for their docility, also wore red surcoats. Red, for\nmartyrdom. Red for the blood poor Alain had shed. Simon sighed inwardly\nand hoped that God considered Alain a martyr and had taken him up to\nheaven. Had he not died while in the service of the Church? Was this not\na crusade in all but name?\n\nAlain was dressed in a white linen surcoat and a white silk mantle.\nSimon, Henri de Puys and the other four knights had dressed him\nthemselves. What agony! The struggle to get poor dead Alain's big frame\ninto his garments had taken nearly an hour.\n\nThank heaven de Puys had stopped Simon from trying to dress Alain in his\nmail shirt and hose, as Simon had originally intended. De Puys pointed\nout that Alain's family were poor, and that Alain's younger brother\nwould have need of the expensive armor. So the armor would be sent back\nto the Gobignon domain along with the news that Alain was dead.\n\nOh, the woe Alain's widowed mother and younger brother would feel when\nSimon's letter reached them! Friar Mathieu had helped him compose the\nimpossible lines, but Simon still felt they were not gentle enough, not\ncomforting enough. He hated himself for feeling relieved that Alain's\nfamily was too far away for him to deliver the news in person. He had\ndone the best he could, sending the letter and Alain's armor to his\nchaplain at Ch\u00e2teau Gobignon with instructions to take it personally to\nthe de Pirennes and read it to them, offering them all possible\nconsolation, they being almost certainly unlettered.\n\nAround Alain's waist was clasped his jeweled belt of knighthood, and to\nhis leather boots were fastened his knight's silver spurs. His\nvelvet-gloved hands, resting on his chest, grasped the hilt of his naked\nlongsword. Simon would buy another sword for his brother. His helmet,\npolished to mirror brightness by his sobbing equerry, rested beside his\nblond head. His shield, square at the top and pointed at the bottom,\nblazoned with five black eaglets on a gold ground, lay crosswise at his\nfeet. Those things Alain must take to his final rest.\n\nSimon's stomach was a hollow of anguish. Those splendid arms, and Alain\nhad never had a chance to use any of them.\n\nA breeze stirred the curly yellow locks of the pale head that lay on a\nred silk pillow. The air of Orvieto had grown chilly in the three days\nsince Alain's murder. The city had enjoyed almost summer weather until\nlate in the fall, but now November had fallen upon it with icy talons.\nThe sky this morning was a heavy purple-gray, and a dampness in the air\nforetold chill rain.\n\nAt the very head of the procession walked Henri de Puys, bareheaded but\nin full armor, leading Alain's riderless great horse. The cart bearing\nthe body, driven by a servant in orange and green Monaldeschi livery,\nfollowed. Then came Simon and the other French knights.\n\n_Please, God, let nothing else unseemly happen today. Let us bury your\nservant the Sire Alain de Pirenne with honor._\n\nHe looked back and saw that the two Tartars, wearing their cylindrical\ncaps adorned with red stones and their red and blue silk jackets, had\nmounted their horses. Because Alain was a warrior and they were\nwarriors, they rode horses to honor him today.\n\nThe sight of them was a reproach to Simon. If he had thought only of the\nTartars and not become involved with Sophia, Alain would be alive today.\n\nAfter the Tartars, rows of spear points and bowl-shaped helmets\nglittered, the Monaldeschi retainers and men-at-arms. Behind the\nMonaldeschi banner, two green chevrons on an orange background, rose a\ncurtained sedan chair draped with black mourning streamers. In it, Simon\nknew, were the contessa and her grandnephew.\n\nSimon had been waiting for the contessa to appear. He raised his arm in\na signal to de Puys, who began to walk southward, toward the Corso,\npulling the reins of Alain's horse. The wheels of the cart creaked into\nmotion.\n\nAs the procession wound its way through the larger streets of Orvieto,\nthe thought occurred to Simon that Alain's killer might be among the\nonlookers, one of the faces that watched, with little emotion, from the\nsidelines or looked out of a second-story window.\n\nSordello had sent word through Ana that among Giancarlo's hired bravos,\nnone had any idea who might have stabbed Alain.\n\nSimon knew what the Orvietans, most of them, must be saying. _A French\nknight goes whoring and gets himself stabbed, and they give him the\ngreatest funeral since Julius Caesar's._\n\nA stab of guilt shot through him. To protect Sophia, he had told de\nVerceuil and d'Ucello that he and Alain had gone wenching. He had\nbesmirched Alain's reputation.\n\nThe cortege stopped at every church in Orvieto, and before each Alain's\nbody was blessed by two or three cardinals, who then with their\nentourages joined the long line of mourners. Looking back over his\nshoulder, Simon could no longer see the end of the procession. It\ndisappeared around a distant turning in the street.\n\nNot all Orvietans were without feeling. Many girls and young women wept,\nwaved their handkerchiefs, and threw flowers from balconies to the\nhandsome Frenchman, murdered in his prime. Alain would have welcomed\nmore attention from them when he was alive, Simon thought bitterly.\n\nAt the convent of the Dominicans, a collection of brown stone buildings\nbehind a high wall, the rotund Fra Tomasso d'Aquino emerged, followed by\ntwo dozen or more of his Dominican brothers, all in white wool tunics\nwith black mantles. Three of the leading members of the preaching\nfriars, the superior general, the father visitor for northern Italy, and\nthe prior of the convent blessed the body. Fra Tomasso was to deliver\nthe funeral sermon, a great honor for Alain. It must be downright\npainful for the fat friar to walk from his convent to the cathedral;\nthat was an honor in itself.\n\nBut the sight of Fra Tomasso made Simon cold with anxiety, remembering\nhow Sophia had told him that the stout Dominican had turned against the\nTartars.\n\nThe one thing that might, even if only in a small way, make up for the\ninfinite tragedy of Alain's death, was that important piece of\ninformation Sophia had unwittingly given Simon. And when Simon had told\nit to Friar Mathieu, the old Franciscan, feeling he had no choice, had\ntaken the news to de Verceuil. Simon hated to see him do that, but he\nhad to agree that de Verceuil was the only one in their party whose\nposition was exalted enough to permit him to make demands on Fra\nTomasso.\n\nDe Verceuil had paid a call on the superior general of the Dominicans,\nbut what went on behind the walls of the preaching friars' convent Simon\nand Friar Mathieu had never learned. In his usual infuriating way, de\nVerceuil had refused to talk about it.\n\nAt the gateway to his palace, Pope Urban, all in gold and white, met the\nprocession. As Simon dismounted and knelt on the stone street to receive\nthe pope's blessing, he noted that the old man's face was as pale as his\nvestments, and that his hands were trembling. Had Alain's murder\naffected him so, or was he ill? Urban was flanked by six cardinals in\nbroad-brimmed red hats and brilliant red robes. On his right were three\nFrench cardinals, including de Verceuil. Beside him was Guy le Gros,\nwhom Simon had met at the pope's council.\n\nLe Gros looked angry. Simon hoped he was angry about Alain's murder;\nevery Frenchman in Orvieto should be. But what a shame that Alain had to\ndie in order that all these people care about him.\n\nOn Urban's left were three Italians, the diminutive Ugolini standing\nright beside the pope. The sight of him was a blow to Simon's heart.\nSimon had been in his mansion wooing Sophia when Alain was murdered.\nAlain's bleeding body had lain across the street from Ugolini's mansion,\nfor how many hours?\n\nAnd where was Sophia? Anxiously Simon scanned the crowd for a sight of\nher. Would she not come? Had Alain's death frightened her? Would he ever\nsee her again?\n\nHe despised himself for still wanting to see Sophia, when his tryst with\nher had caused Alain's death. He should give her up.\n\n_I cannot give her up._\n\nAfter the blessing, Pope Urban took his place, with his escort of\ncardinals, at the head of the procession. They moved to the piazza\nbefore the cathedral, as packed with people as it had been the day the\nheretic was executed there. Death, death, here they were again, to\ncelebrate death.\n\nWhen Alain's body reached the cathedral, Pope Urban blessed it once\nmore. Simon and the other French knights raised a pallet that was hidden\nunder the red samite cloth and carried Alain into the cathedral.\n\nThe cathedral was a festival of light, and the sight of it made Simon\nfeel a little better. Simon and de Verceuil had agreed to share the\nexpenses of the funeral, which included the rows of candles lighting the\naltar, all of the purest beeswax, and the double line of fat candles in\ntall brass sticks running down the middle of the church. Benches had\nbeen cleared from the nave of the cathedral to make room for the funeral\nprocession.\n\nThe shadows where the massed candle flames did not reach were\nilluminated by a dim, underwater glow--faint because the sky was\novercast--that seeped in through the narrow stained glass windows,\ntouching a mourner here or there with a spot of red light, or blue or\ngreen.\n\nThe French knights carried Alain to the front of the cathedral and set\nhis body down on a red-draped platform. Simon took a position to the\nright of the body. From here he could see rows of cardinals and bishops\non either side of him. The cardinals in their red hats sat in the first\nrow, and Simon recognized de Verceuil by his height and by the shining\nwaves of black hair that tumbled from under the wide brim of his\ntasseled hat.\n\nThe Contessa di Monaldeschi walked slowly up the aisle, leaning on the\narm of her plump grandnephew. As she neared the altar, Cardinal Ugolini\nsuddenly broke away from his position beside Pope Urban and bustled down\nto take her other arm. With these two escorts, both the same height, the\ncontessa tottered to a high-backed, cushioned seat on the right side of\nthe altar. Ugolini stroked her hand, whispered to her, kissed her cheek,\nand went back up the altar steps to stand beside the pope.\n\n_I wish he were not so friendly with the contessa. It is a danger to the\nalliance._\n\nIt occurred to Simon suddenly that Alain's death would go for nothing if\nthe pact between Tartars and Christians were not sealed. Now Simon had\nanother reason, beside the restoration of his family honor, beside his\nlove for King Louis, to strive for the alliance.\n\nOn the side of the altar opposite the contessa, also in a high-backed\narmchair, sat a dark young man about Simon's age in a surcoat of blue\nvelvet with a heavy gold chain around his neck. He sat very erect, and\nhis dark eyes burned with hatred as he stared across the altar at the\ncontessa and her grandnephew. He had been pointed out before to Simon as\nMarco di Filippeschi, capo della famiglia of the Monaldeschi's\narchenemies.\n\nThe contessa herself had suggested that a Filippeschi might have\nmurdered Alain just because he was a guest of the Monaldeschi family.\nSimon supposed the Filippeschi chieftain was paying public respect to\nAlain to demonstrate his family's innocence. The Filippeschi, Simon had\nheard, were opposed to a French presence in Italy--perhaps simply\nbecause the Monaldeschi were friendly to the French.\n\nSo opposed that they would murder an innocent young man? Simon burned to\nseize Marco di Filippeschi and throttle the truth from him.\n\nBy turning his head slightly, Simon could see Friar Mathieu on the left\nside of the church, sitting in the midst of the Franciscan congregation.\n\nBeyond the Franciscans, in the shadow of a pillar, stood a stout man in\ndark cape and tunic. D'Ucello, the podesta, observing the\nfuneral--thinking perhaps that Alain's killer might attend. He prayed\nthat the podesta would stop wasting his time pursuing the nonexistent\nwomen Simon and Alain had been with.\n\n_Find Alain's killer, damn you!_ Simon thought, clenching his teeth.\n\nSimon turned briefly to survey the crowd that filled the nave all the\nway to the doors. Halfway back, a spot of red light from a window fell\non a man's blond hair. Simon was almost certain that was David of\nTrebizond. He still saw no sign of Sophia, and his heart fell.\n\nAs Simon watched the pope celebrate the mass, assisted by the two\ncardinals, the Italian Ugolini and the French le Gros, he wondered\nwhether Alain was watching from heaven. He must be in heaven. Was he not\na martyr?\n\nBut did Alain care about what was happening on this earth? Surely a man\nwould want to see his own funeral. For a moment Simon imagined he could\nspeak to Alain, reach out and touch him.\n\n_How do you like this, my friend? The pope himself says mass for you._\n\nSimon choked on a sob and had to wipe tears from his face.\n\nThe pope sang the Gospel in a quavering voice, and a chorus of stout\nyoung priests boomed back the responses. The voices, rising and falling\nin the chant devised by Pope Gregory the Great, unaccompanied by any\ninstrument, rebounded from the heavy stones of the vaulted ceiling.\n\nSimon swore to himself he would write about this to Alain's mother.\n\nWhen it came time for the sermon, Fra Tomasso d'Aquino rose from the\nbench that had been set for him at the front of the cathedral. He\nturned and bowed to the pope, who sat in a throne on the right side of\nthe altar. Pope Urban's hand twitched in a small gesture of blessing.\n\nStanding at the head of Alain's bier, Simon was close enough to Fra\nTomasso to hear the breath whistling through his nostrils as he exerted\nhimself to move his bulk from bench to altar steps. The black rosary\naround his middle rattled with his steps and creaked with his heavy\nbreathing.\n\nA hush, heavy with the odor of incense, fell over the crowd assembled in\nthe nave. For a sermon by a bishop or even a cardinal, this crowd of\nhigh-ranking prelates would probably go on whispering to each other. But\nall were interested in hearing the philosopher-friar who was famous\nthroughout Christendom, whom some revered as a living saint and a few\nothers considered a subtle heretic.\n\nFra Tomasso spoke Latin, as was customary before any assemblage of\nchurchmen. His tenor voice sent high-pitched reverberations through the\nnave of the great church. It is a sad moment, he said, when God chooses\nto cut off a young man in his prime, yet it happens all too often. I\nshare the sorrow of the family and friends of this excellent young\nknight, he said, and Simon felt comforted. Indeed, all Christendom must\nmourn the loss of such a fine young man, killed while performing his\nduty, far from home, guarding an embassy to His Holiness from the other\nside of the earth.\n\n_And accompanying a friend making a secret visit to a lady._\n\nThe stout friar waxed philosophic, as was expected of him, discoursing\non the Fifth Commandment, \"Thou shalt not kill,\" using Alain as an\nexample. The Sire de Pirenne's death was murder, ambush out of the dark,\nhe said.\n\nLoud coughing interrupted the sermon. Simon looked and saw that it was\nPope Urban, bent double, Cardinal le Gros holding his arm and resting a\nhand on his shoulder, while Cardinal Ugolini looked alarmed. The\ncoughing had a burbling sound to it, as if the old pope's lungs were\nfull of fluid. A cough like that in November was an ominous thing,\nthought Simon.\n\nFra Tomasso resumed when His Holiness had quieted. To kill is not always\na sin, he said, but to kill the innocent is. It is not a sin, therefore,\nto wage war on the Saracens, as pope after pope has called upon good\nChristian warriors to do, because the Saracens are not innocent. They\nhold in their clutches the most sacred places of Christendom, the lands\nwhere Our Lord Jesus Christ was born and died; they rob and murder\npilgrims seeking to visit those holy places; and they seek to spread\nthe false religion of Mohammedanism which denies the central mystery of\nour faith--Christ crucified, dead, and risen again. For all these\nreasons the Saracens should be fought.\n\nFra Tomasso paused and looked about him. Simon felt that the pause was\nintended to be significant, that the great Dominican was about to say\nsomething very important. But the silence was disturbed by a whispering.\nIt came from behind Simon and to his right. He glanced in that direction\nand saw that the Bulgarian woman, Ana, was sitting with the two Tartars\nand was whispering her translation of Fra Tomasso's sermon to John, the\nolder one, who was immediately on her left.\n\n\"We may ask ourselves, why does God permit an innocent young man like\nthis to die?\" Fra Tomasso went on. \"The answer is, of course, that He\npermits it to make possible a greater good, the exercise of human free\nwill. I say to you that Our Lord, Jesus Christ, crucified at the age of\nthirty-three, is the type of all innocent young men done to death by\nevil. And evil is a necessary consequence of human freedom.\"\n\nFra Tomasso looked out over his audience for another silent moment, then\nsaid, \"God must value freedom very highly if He allows so much evil to\noccur, just so freedom can exist.\"\n\n_I never thought of that._\n\nBut there was very little freedom in the world, Simon thought, apart\nfrom the power to sin. Everybody from kings down to the meanest serfs\nwas bound in a net of obligations, duties, laws, loyalties, obedience.\nSimon remembered what Friar Mathieu had said about using Fra Tomasso's\nvow of obedience, through de Verceuil's speaking to his Dominican\nsuperior, to force him to give up his opposition to the alliance.\n\nAnd now Simon noticed that Fra Tomasso was looking at de Verceuil.\n\n\"Often, all too often, one man will seek to rob another of the freedom\nto do what is right,\" Fra Tomasso said. \"If a superior commands another\nto do wrong, and the inferior obeys, the one who gives the wrongful\norder bears the greater burden of guilt. But some guilt also falls upon\nthe one who obeys. It is only with the greatest reluctance and after the\ngreatest deliberation that one should disobey any order from one of\nhigher rank. But there are times when it must be done.\"\n\nAgain he looked at de Verceuil.\n\n\"Thus when we see a mighty nation that again and again does harm to the\ninnocent,\" said Fra Tomasso, \"we are bound in conscience to denounce\nit.\"\n\nSimon felt as if he had been struck on the head with a rock. Now he was\nsure of what was coming. And so, evidently, were others, because a\nmurmuring was arising in the church.\n\nFra Tomasso blinked slowly, as if to show his calm acceptance of the\nstir he was causing. \"We are obliged to denounce unjust war even when\nthe evildoer offers us the hand of fellowship. When a puissant nation\ntakes up arms against the world, when it makes war its chief occupation,\nwhen it attacks peoples that have not harmed it, when it threatens all\nhumanity, we are not permitted to condone such wrongs. When this nation\ncarries war to innocent, unarmed men, women, and children, slaughtering\nthese noncombatants by the tens and hundreds of thousands, we are\nobliged to condemn it.\"\n\n_Oh, my God! If this is the Church's verdict, all is lost._\n\nSimon looked at the pope on his throne to the right of the altar. He sat\nslumped, his white mitre tilted forward, his eyes half shut as if in\nthought. Simon saw no sign that Urban objected to what Fra Tomasso was\nsaying.\n\nThe murmur was louder now. Despairing, Simon turned to look back at the\nTartars. Little points of candlelight were reflected in their black\neyes, and their brown faces were tight. Simon could imagine what would\nhappen to anyone, holy man or not, who spoke out against them so in\ntheir own camp.\n\nThe stout Dominican stretched an arm in a flowing white sleeve toward\nthe still, mail-clad body on the red bier. \"It may be asked, why do I\nspeak of such things on this sad day, when we mourn a young man cruelly\nstruck down in youth? I answer that this young man came here and died\nhere because Christendom is now faced with this great moral dilemma.\nWhat we owe this young man, what we owe any man who dies in the\nperformance of his duty, is to do our own duty.\"\n\n\"Enough! Sit down!\" came a hoarse whisper from Simon's left, and he\nturned to see de Verceuil half out of his chair, fists clenched. It had\nbeen de Verceuil who had wanted Fra Tomasso, as the most distinguished\nspeaker in Orvieto, to deliver the funeral sermon. And doubtless it was\nthe cardinal's heavy-handed dealing with Fra Tomasso that had provoked\nthis particular sermon. And now de Verceuil was trying publicly to\nsilence Fra Tomasso, making more enemies for their cause.\n\nFra Tomasso turned in the cardinal's direction, then once again slowly\nshut his eyes and slowly opened them as he turned away. He went on\nspeaking.\n\n\"And perhaps God has taken this young man from us to remind us how many\nother innocent lives may be lost if we wage war unwisely.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSimon and the other five French knights turned the red-draped wooden\npallet so that Alain's head was toward the altar and his feet toward the\nchurch door. The weight had not bothered Simon carrying Alain into the\nchurch, but now the burden seemed twice as heavy. He was afraid, as he\ndescended the stairs in front of the cathedral, one worn stone step at a\ntime, that his knees might buckle and he might spill Alain to the\nground. He would be anxious until he got Alain back on the cart that\nwould carry him to his final resting place in the cemetery on a hill to\nthe north of Orvieto's great rock.\n\n_And where will I go?_\n\nTrying to get de Verceuil to change Fra Tomasso's mind had been a\nserious error in judgment. Every important churchman and official in\nOrvieto had heard the greatest thinker in Christendom attack the plan of\nChristians and Tartars waging war together on the Saracens. What would\nhappen now?\n\n_Nothing._\n\nNothing would happen, and that was all that was needed for the alliance\nto fail. The Tartars would go home. They would continue their war\nagainst the Saracens, the war they had been losing lately, without\nChristian help. And eventually the Mameluke waves would roll over\nPalestine and Syria and the Christian strongholds in Outremer would\ncrumble like sand castles.\n\n_And the escutcheon of Gobignon is a little more tarnished. And I have\nled my dearest vassal to useless death. Whenever the Tartars leave\nItaly, and it will probably be soon, I will return to Ch\u00e2teau Gobignon a\nfailure._\n\nHe thought back to his meeting with Charles d'Anjou on the wall of the\nLouvre last July. It had seemed then that helping the Tartars to ally\nthemselves with the Christians was a way to change his whole life for\nthe better. He would take his rightful place in the kingdom as a great\nbaron. He would end the shame and suffering he had always lived with.\nHe would hold his head up among the nobility, and King Louis and Count\nCharles would love and respect him.\n\nNow he would accomplish none of those things. He had been knocked from\nhis horse and was rolling in the dust. He would go back to the living\ndeath of being afraid to show his face beyond the bounds of Gobignon,\nthe only place in the world where he was known and respected.\n\nGo back to Gobignon and never see Sophia again? She, at least, would not\nthink less of him because the grand alliance had failed. She probably\nfelt sorry for Alain. Perhaps even felt responsible for his death. Simon\nshould go and reassure her.\n\nAnd then what? Bid her farewell?\n\nHe and de Puys on the other side, two knights behind each of them, slid\nAlain's body with a dry, rasping sound along the unpainted gray wood of\nthe cart bed. The red ribbons on the four tall cartwheels fluttered in\nthe slight breeze.\n\nA thought that had fleetingly occurred to Simon before now formed itself\nsolidly in his mind.\n\nWhat if he were to take Sophia back to Gobignon as his bride?\n\nMany there were who would rail against him for doing it. His grandmother\nin particular, herself the daughter of a king, would be beside herself\nwith fury. King Louis and Uncle Charles might even try to stop him. But\nhe was the Count de Gobignon, a Peer of the Realm, almost a king in his\nown right, and he had tried to do what his elders expected of him, and\nhe had failed.\n\nTwice he had loved women whose lands and high birth made them proper\nmatches for him in the eyes of the world, and twice he had been\nprevented from marrying the woman of his choice because of Count\nAmalric's legacy of wickedness.\n\nWell, the devil take all of them. If they would not accept him as a\nmember of the noblesse, then he was not obliged to behave as one.\n\nSurely his mother and father, considering the way their own marriage had\ncome about, would understand and approve his choice.\n\nAnd somehow he doubted that Cardinal Ugolini would raise any objection\nto his marrying his niece, Sophia.\n\n\n\n\nXXXVII\n\n\n_An open letter from Fra Tomasso d'Aquino of the Order of Preaching\nFriars to the Christian sovereigns of Europe, from Orvieto, 7th day of\nNovember A.D. 1263_\n\n    Let us leave these wild beasts, Tartars and Muslims alike, to devour\n    each other, that they may all be consumed and perish; and we, when\n    we proceed against the enemies of Christ who remain, will slay them\n    and cleanse the face of the earth, so that all the world will be\n    subject to the one Catholic Church and there be one Shepherd and one\n    fold.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen Simon and Friar Mathieu climbed the stone steps into Fra Tomasso's\ncell, pushing up a trapdoor to enter, he was bent over a scroll. He held\nthe two rolled-up ends apart with his fingertips, and as he read he very\ngently pushed down the bottom part of the roll, allowing the part he had\nread to roll up. The scroll looked very old, and the Dominican friar\nhandled it as if it might fall apart in his hands.\n\nHe did not look up at his two visitors. His large head moved ever so\nslightly from side to side as he scanned the lines of writing, and Simon\ncould hear his loud breathing just as he had a week ago in the\ncathedral. Simon and Friar Mathieu stood quietly and waited for Fra\nTomasso to stop reading and notice them.\n\nIt had taken Friar Mathieu's Franciscan superiors a week of delicate\nnegotiations after Alain's funeral to arrange an audience with the\nDominican philosopher for Friar Mathieu and Simon. Simon prayed, feeling\nthe sweat break out on his forehead, that their intrusion would not\nannoy Fra Tomasso. He desperately hoped that they could persuade him to\nchange his mind about the alliance.\n\nIt was really up to Friar Mathieu, he thought. That Simon could have any\neffect on such a brilliant philosopher was unthinkable.\n\nSimon noticed a single deep crease between the great Dominican's\neyebrows. His forehead bulged on either side of the crease, as if the\nmuscles that made him frown had grown from much exercise. The brows\nthemselves were so fair and sparse as to seem almost invisible.\n\nFra Tomasso laid a broad right hand on the scroll to hold it open,\npicked up a feather pen with his left hand, dipped the sharpened tip\ninto a tiny ink jar, and began making small, rapid marks on a piece of\nparchment. Simon watched with interest. Since his university days, he\nrarely saw people reading and writing, and could not remember ever\nseeing anyone write with his left hand. When the pen ran dry, Fra\nTomasso happened to glance up as he dipped it again.\n\n\"Dear Lord, forgive me,\" he said, his eyes round with surprise.\n\"Friends, I did not hear you enter. Please pardon my rudeness.\" Simon\nwas gratified to hear him speak French and impressed by his fluency.\n\n\"It is we who are guilty of rudeness, Fra Tomasso,\" said Friar Mathieu,\n\"for interrupting your work.\"\n\n\"My brothers in Christ are more important than books,\" said the stout\nDominican, gesturing to them to take seats on his bed.\n\nHis cell was a circular room occupying the top floor of a tower in the\ncompound that housed his order in Orvieto. The curved walls of the room\nwere painted as white as Fra Tomasso's robe. A black wooden cross\nsurmounted by a white ivory figure of Jesus hung over the bed. Fra\nTomasso sat, his chair hidden by his great bulk, with his back to a\nwindow, at a large trestle table with stacks of books and boxes of\nscrolls on either side of him. His bed was a wide, sturdy wooden\nplatform covered with a straw-filled mattress and a blanket the size of\na galley's sail. A giant could lie on that bed, Simon thought.\n\n\"I must admit this scroll is a great treasure, and I am reluctant to\ntear my eyes from it,\" he said. \"A hitherto lost treatise of Aristotle\non the composition and movements of the heavenly bodies. This copy might\nbe over six hundred years old. In Greek. You are familiar with _the_\nphilosopher?\" He looked from Friar Mathieu to Simon eagerly.\n\n\"I did study for a year at P\u00e8re Sorbonne's college in Paris, Your\nReverence,\" said Simon. \"We read the works of several philosophers.\"\n\nFra Tomasso smiled indulgently. \"I always refer to Aristotle as _the_\nphilosopher because I can learn more from him than from any other\nancient or modern thinker. Do you not agree, Reverend Father?\" He\nturned to Friar Mathieu. \"Or are you, like so many of your fellow\nFranciscans, uninterested in philosophy?\"\n\n_Oh, God, he scorns Franciscans_, thought Simon with dread. _We're sure\nto fail._\n\n\"I truly would like to find the time for it,\" said Friar Mathieu,\nunruffled. \"But I seem to be always traveling.\"\n\nFra Tomasso nodded. \"You and that merchant from Trebizond are the only\ntwo Christians in Orvieto who have traveled among the Tartars. I found\nyour testimony at His Holiness's council quite fascinating.\"\n\n\"But not persuasive?\" Friar Mathieu leaned forward intently.\n\nSimon caught his breath. Fra Tomasso had given them an opening.\n\n\"I presumed that was why you had come to see me,\" said Fra Tomasso with\na self-satisfied smile. \"Let me assure you, good friar and noble count,\nthat until a little over a week ago I had tried to keep to a strict\nneutrality, feeling that in that way I could be more useful to His\nHoliness. Even after hearing the Tartars condemn themselves out of their\nown mouths at the Contessa di Monaldeschi's reception. But then I\nchanged my mind.\"\n\n\"Let me ask you a rather delicate question, Your Reverence,\" said Friar\nMathieu.\n\nFra Tomasso leaned back and rested his hands, fingers laced, on his huge\nbelly. \"Any question at all.\"\n\n\"Did Cardinal de Verceuil's behavior toward you have anything to do with\nyour change of mind?\"\n\nThe crease in the Dominican philosopher's forehead deepened. Simon\nwinced inwardly. What if, now, they had truly offended Fra Tomasso?\n\n\"Surely you do not suggest that I would let personal pique determine my\nposition on a matter so important to the future of Christendom?\"\n\n\"I am not surprised, knowing Your Reverence's reputation, that you grasp\njust how important the matter is,\" Friar Mathieu said.\n\nNeatly sidestepping Fra Tomasso's question, Simon thought.\n\n\"Exactly. Thus it was that when Cardinal de Verceuil went to Fra\nAugustino da Varda, my Superior General, demanding that he order me to\nchange my position on the Tartars, I realized it was time for me to come\nto a conclusion.\"\n\n\"I made a terrible mistake,\" said Friar Mathieu as much to himself and\nSimon as to Fra Tomasso. \"May God forgive me.\"\n\n\"What mistake was that?\" asked Fra Tomasso.\n\n\"Not trying to discuss this with Your Reverence myself, as I am doing\nnow. To be honest, I feared you would not care to meet with a poor\nFranciscan.\"\n\n\"Again you do me an injustice,\" said Fra Tomasso. \"_The_ philosopher\ntells us that we acquire knowledge first of all through the senses.\nTherefore, if you would know about something, ask of those who have seen\nit firsthand.\"\n\n\"Then perhaps you have new questions,\" said Friar Mathieu.\n\nSimon felt despair pressing on him like a mail shirt that was too heavy.\nFra Tomasso was a man whose whole life was argument. How could Friar\nMathieu hope to persuade him to change his mind about anything?\n\nHis chair creaking loudly, Fra Tomasso leaned forward and rested his\nelbows on the table in front of him. \"I am so sure of my conclusions\nthat I have written to Emperor Sigismund in Germany, King Boleslav in\nPoland, and King Wenceslas in Hungary--all lands that have suffered from\nthe depredations of the Tartars, urging them to beg His Holiness to\nrepudiate this scheme that will bring the frontier of Tartary so much\ncloser to us. I have written to King Louis of France, your liege lord,\ntoo, young Count de Gobignon, even though he is said to be eager for a\npact with the Tartars. Furthermore, Father da Varda is considering my\nproposal that the Dominican order all over Christendom preach against an\nalliance with the Tartars.\"\n\nHearing in Fra Tomasso's words the ruin of all his hopes, Simon could\nnot contain himself. He burst out. \"_Why?_\"\n\nFra Tomasso looked surprised, even a bit affronted. \"For all the reasons\nyou heard in church last Friday. They are not simple savages, my young\nfriend. They are diabolical.\"\n\nIt was hopeless. Simon's heart sank lower and lower. The great\npreacher's mind was made up.\n\n\"Yes, but, Your Reverence\"--Simon felt driven by desperation to debate\nwith a man whom he knew was invincible in argument--\"we all know of many\ntimes when Christians and Saracens have been just as cruel.\"\n\nFriar Mathieu gave a little grunt of agreement.\n\nFra Tomasso looked down at his thumbs, the tips pressed together as they\nrested on his wide belly. There was a moment of silence. He was\nthinking, Simon realized. Hardly ever had Simon seen a man stop to\nthink before speaking in an argument. He began to tremble inwardly,\nexpecting to be crushed.\n\nFra Tomasso raised a fat finger. \"Yes, I know that Christian knights\nhave also committed barbarities. But they did so in mindless rage, and\nafterward they were ashamed. Even the Mohammedan faith teaches the\nSaracens to wage only just wars, to be compassionate, to spare the\ninnocent and helpless. I stipulate that neither Christians nor\nMohammedans live up to these laws. But they _profess_ them. The Tartars\nhave no such laws. In their bottomless ignorance they think that it is\n_good_ to commit deeds of unimaginable horror, and they do it with\ncalculation. Exemplum: As David of Trebizond has told me, when they wipe\nout the population of a city, they know there will be a few survivors.\nSo, weeks later, they return to the ruins when the remaining few people\nhave emerged from hiding, and they slaughter them all. That is the worst\nsort of evil--evil done with utter deliberation.\"\n\n_David of Trebizond, may he roast in hell!_ thought Simon.\n\n\"With respect, Your Reverence,\" said Friar Mathieu, \"the Tartars have\nlived isolated in their prairie homeland since the beginning of time.\nBut I beg of you to believe that they can be won to the mercy of Christ.\nI have seen it. I have _done_ it.\"\n\n_We are gaining ground_, Simon thought. If Fra Tomasso really could be\nswayed by the testimony of a person who had seen with his own eyes, they\nhad a chance.\n\nA hammering from beneath the floor made Simon start. Someone was\nknocking on the trapdoor. Friar Mathieu nibbled at his mustache in\nvexation while Fra Tomasso smiled broadly and called, \"Come up.\"\n\nThe heavy door creaked upward, pushed by a hand in a white sleeve. A\nshiny, tonsured scalp reflected the light from the tower window.\n\nThe young Dominican who emerged was almost too breathless to speak.\n\"Reverend Father! News from Bolsena! Un miracolo!\"\n\nFra Tomasso's eyes widened. \"Bolsena? Is that near here?\"\n\n\"So near, Reverend Father, that the miracle happened yesterday and the\nnews reached us this afternoon.\"\n\n\"What miracle?\"\n\n\"A foreign priest--from some eastern country--was saying mass. And when\nhe got to the consecration and raised the Sacred Host\"--the young\nfriar's eyes glowed--\"the Host dripped blood!\"\n\nSimon's head spun in confusion. Frustrated rage at being interrupted\nwhen they were so close to victory struggled with amazement at this tale\nof a bleeding Communion wafer. He looked at Fra Tomasso, and all hope\nebbed away. The philosopher's face fairly glowed with relief. Sadness\nswelled in Simon. They did not have a chance. Perhaps they had never had\none.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBefore they knew it, it seemed, Friar Mathieu and Simon were walking\ntogether out the gate of the Dominican convent. Behind them there were\nshouts and white-robed friars bustling to and fro like a flock of\nstartled doves. The whole convent, it seemed, was in an uproar over the\nmiracle at Bolsena.\n\nFra Tomasso had courteously but firmly dismissed Mathieu and Simon,\nsaying that he must question the one who brought the news. He might, he\nsaid, be called upon to look further into the event at Bolsena, and he\nmust be fully prepared.\n\nSimon had wanted to protest. If Fra Tomasso would only give them a\nlittle more time, he would surely have to change his mind about the\nTartars. But Simon sensed that Fra Tomasso did not want to change his\nmind.\n\nThe sky was cold and gray as chain mail. Carters, horsemen, and laborers\non foot bustled along, their cloaks pulled tight around them against the\nchill north wind.\n\n_All is lost_, Simon thought, as he had after Alain's funeral. Just when\nthey were gaining ground with Fra Tomasso, news of a miracle. Was God\nHimself against them?\n\nSkulking back to Gobignon. Forever to be known, not as the count who\nhelped liberate Jerusalem, but as the son of the traitor Amalric.\n\n_Maybe I should give it all up and become a Franciscan, like Friar\nMathieu._\n\n\"Where did he get that scroll?\" Friar Mathieu wondered.\n\n\"What can we do now?\" said Simon. He was not really asking; it was only\na way of saying he thought nothing could be done. He was in despair over\nthe failure of their mission.\n\nThen he thought of Sophia.\n\nIn an instant a light bloomed within him. Skulking back to Gobignon? No,\nriding back in triumph, with the most beautiful woman in the world\nbeside him as his bride.\n\nHe had not yet nerved himself to propose to Sophia, but now that they\nhad failed with Fra Tomasso, he could not wait to see her again.\n\nFriar Mathieu scratched his white beard thoughtfully. \"It was de\nVerceuil who tipped the scales against the Tartars. And it was we who\nsent de Verceuil. I thought this might be the one time he could be\nuseful to us.\"\n\n\"Fra Tomasso had already sided with Ugolini's faction,\" Simon said.\n\"That is why we sent de Verceuil.\"\n\n\"He told us today that he had been trying to be neutral,\" said Friar\nMathieu. \"But Sophia told you that Fra Tomasso had already sided with\nUgolini's party. Do you suppose the great Dominican was not being candid\nwith us? Or was it Sophia who was not being candid?\"\n\nSimon gasped at the sudden pain of a blow that was worse than their\nfailure with Fra Tomasso. Sophia not honest? No, he could not live with\nthat.\n\nHe stiffened so suddenly that his horse stopped walking. He stared at\nFriar Mathieu in dismay.\n\nFriar Mathieu reached over and put his hand on Simon's arm. His touch\nwas light but firm.\n\n\"Know where you are going, Simon. Do not travel blindly.\"\n\nSimon nodded. There was a way to find out the truth about Sophia.\n\nHe must put Sordello to work. The mere thought of that blackguard spying\non Sophia twisted his heart with anguish. But he had to know the truth.\n\n\n\n\nXXXVIII\n\n\n_A letter from Emir Daoud ibn Abdallah to El Malik Baibars\nal-Bunduqdari, from Orvieto, 13th day of Muharram, 663 A.H.:_\n\n    O Pillar of the Faith, the gift of the ancient scroll to the\n    Christian scholar Tomasso d'Aquino has served our purposes beyond my\n    expectations. At the same time that I delivered the scroll to him, I\n    arranged for the allies of the Tartars to be deceived into thinking\n    that the priest Tomasso was already in our camp. They chose the\n    arrogant Cardinal de Verceuil, of whom I have told you, to bring\n    his influence to bear on the priest Tomasso. The cardinal's\n    treatment of Tomasso so offended him that he was driven to take the\n    side we wished of him.\n\n    This Tomasso has turned the clouds Ugolini and I stirred up into a\n    veritable thunderstorm. The pope cannot proclaim a crusade unless he\n    has the support of the Christian kingdoms and peoples. Otherwise,\n    they will support him only halfheartedly or not at all. I confess I\n    am surprised at how often the Christians of Europe choose to neglect\n    or even refuse to do what the pope demands of them.\n\n    As we know, the Christians of today have not the zeal to make war on\n    us that their forefathers had. Let time pass, and Hulagu Khan will\n    lose patience and recall his ambassadors. The Christians will fight\n    among themselves here in Europe. And, if God wills it, Islam will\n    know peace. Such is my deepest desire.\n\n    Time, O Malik Dahir, is our ally.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDaoud stood at his writing desk, smiling at the tiny Arabic characters\nwith which he had covered the thin square of parchment.\n\nEl Malik Dahir--the victorious king. How well Daoud remembered the day\nBaibars had, with his help, assumed that title.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRiding back from the victory at the Well of Goliath, the Mameluke army\nwas camped outside Bilbeis, two days' ride northeast of El Kahira.\nTomorrow Sultan Qutuz would hold audience at Bilbeis, and soon after he\nwould ride into El Kahira in triumph, a triumph Baibars had earned for\nhim.\n\nBaibars was alone in his tent when Daoud answered his summons. His blue\neye glittered out of deep shadows cast on his face by a small oil lamp\nthat hung in the center of the tent. With his own hand Baibars served\nDaoud kaviyeh from a pot on a brazier, and the two men sat side by side,\nturned toward each other.\n\n\"Again he refused me,\" Baibars said. \"I have given him every chance,\nDaoud.\"\n\nBaibars's face was calm, but Daoud knew that the fury of a Tartar was\nboiling within him.\n\nA reddish haze obscured the tent for Daoud as he fought back his own\nrage at the injustice to Baibars.\n\n\"He thinks I want to be governor of Aleppo merely out of ambition,\"\nBaibars said.\n\n\"The sultan is a fool,\" said Daoud.\n\nThe single sighted eye transfixed him. \"No, not a fool. He played the\ngame of power well enough when he made himself sultan. No one could\nblame him for the murders of Ai Beg and Spray of Pearls. He restored\norder to El Kahira. His mistake now is in not trusting me. And that is\nan understandable mistake.\" Baibars stretched his thin lips in a sudden\ngrin.\n\n\"Understandable how?\" Daoud experienced that unsettling sense he often\nhad that the one-eyed emir was always two or three jumps ahead of him.\n\n\"It comes of too much cleverness,\" said Baibars. \"He does not believe me\nwhen I say I want to be governor of Aleppo because it is the first city\nHulagu Khan will attack. He suspects me of a hidden motive. He thinks\nthat if he gives me Aleppo I will break with El Kahira and claim all of\nSyria for my own, because that is what _he_ would do. But Hulagu Khan,\nseeking vengeance for the Well of Goliath, is coming from Persia with\nall his power. May God send to the eternal fire a commander wicked\nenough to divide the kingdom at such a time.\"\n\nThe kaviyeh Daoud held had cooled. He drained the glazed earthenware cup\nand put it down beside him.\n\n\"The sultan himself divides the kingdom,\" said Daoud, \"by dishonoring\nyou.\"\n\n\"It is more than dishonor. It is war. If he thinks me too dangerous to\nbe ruler of Aleppo, it means that he thinks me too dangerous to live.\"\n\nDaoud felt as if his heart had dropped into the cold, black bottom of a\nwell. If Qutuz destroyed Baibars, he would destroy Islam and El Kahira\nand all of them. Daoud's whole world.\n\n\"What will you do?\" said Daoud.\n\n\"I do not know what I will do,\" said Baibars, fixing his one eye on\nDaoud. \"But you know that if he kills me, he will kill all close to me.\nWhat will _you_ do?\"\n\nDaoud felt the edge of the headsman's blade on the back of his neck as\nhe had not felt it since that day Qutuz demanded his death. The thought\nof being executed at Qutuz's command outraged him. It was one thing to\ndie as a mujahid, a martyr in holy war for Islam, destined to be taken\nat once into paradise. But what a shameful fate, to be murdered because\nyour own sovereign lord did not trust you.\n\n\"I am your slave, Effendi.\"\n\n\"Not slave, Daoud. You are as near a son to me as a Mameluke can be. Are\nyou not the husband of my favorite daughter? I speak now with you\nbecause I must speak, and in all this camp you are the only one I can\nrely on absolutely.\"\n\nDaoud felt tears coming to his eyes. He was embarrassed, even though he\nknew it was a manly thing to weep easily. For him crying was rare.\n\nBaibars rested a large, strong hand on Daoud's arm.\n\n\"Never to know any brothers but our khushdashiya, our barracks mates,\nnever to know any father but the emir who trained and freed us, it makes\nus the hardest, the finest warriors in the world. But we long for the\nloving families we never had.\"\n\nDaoud wiped his face with the sleeve of his robe.\n\nThey sat in silence for a long time, while Daoud, stroking his thick\nblond beard, grappled with what Baibars was asking of him. Asking, not\nin words, but in the spaces between the words.\n\nBaibars spoke. \"Remember what the Tartar general, Ket Bogha, called\nQutuz? The murderer of his master. The world belittles us because each\nsultan has climbed to the throne over the murdered body of the last\nsultan. Turan Shah, murdered.\"\n\nHe held up his left hand, his sword hand.\n\n\"I myself killed Turan Shah because he betrayed the Mamelukes. Next, Ai\nBeg, murdered. The Sultana Spray of Pearls, murdered. Ali, son of Ai\nBeg, murdered. Each murder weakens the throne itself.\"\n\n\"The throne is as strong as the man who holds it,\" said Daoud.\n\nBaibars continued to look at his left hand, his head turned to the side\nin his one-eyed way. \"Even so, Ai Beg did not himself kill Turan Shah\nand Qutuz did not himself kill Ali. If I kill Qutuz and take the throne\nwith his blood on my hand, I am inviting every other Mameluke emir to\nkill me when my back is turned. The title of El Malik, the sultan, chief\nsovereign of Islam, will be like a ball in a game of mall, flying this\nway and that.\"\n\nDaoud felt as if he were standing at the mouth of an enormous black\ncave. It was one thing to know that Qutuz was not fit to rule. It was\nanother thing to think of striking down the sultan, the anointed of God.\nIf Daoud entered this cave, he might never come out again. He might\nleave it only to fall into the flames of hell. He seemed to see stars in\nthe depths of the cave, as if he were looking into the world beyond the\nworld. Somewhere among those stars, God dwelt in His paradise with those\nHe loved around Him, the Archangel Gabriel, and the Prophet, and Abraham\nand Jesus, and the saints and martyrs of Islam.\n\n_Is it God's will that I kill the sultan? How can I know?_\n\nHe could not know. But he did know that second only to his submission\nto God, the most important thing in his life was devotion to his emir.\nAs Baibars said, his khushdashiya and his emir were all a Mameluke had.\n\nHe leaned closer to Baibars.\n\n\"Whoever dishonors my lord Baibars deserves instant death at the hands\nof my lord's servant.\"\n\nBaibars closed both eyes with a look of satisfaction.\n\n\"Have I asked you to kill--anyone?\" he said.\n\n\"No, Effendi.\"\n\nThey sat in silence again. The desert wind hummed in the ropes of\nBaibars's tent, and the poles shifted and creaked.\n\n\"If someone wished to kill Qutuz,\" said Baibars, \"he should recall that\nwe are now very close to El Kahira. Once Qutuz rides on streets\nfestooned with silks and carpeted with flowers, once people see him as\nthe victor of the Well of Goliath, they will love him too much. They\nwould never accept his being taken from them. We could not control their\nfury.\"\n\nDaoud said, \"Tomorrow, when he holds audience at the palace of the\ngovernor of Bilbeis, men from all over the district with requests for\nfavors, with claims, with grievances, will surround him, clamoring.\nAnyone could easily approach him.\"\n\nBaibars nodded. \"Let him be struck down before the eyes of many. Let it\nbe like a public sacrifice. I would rather see it done so than by poison\nor ambush.\" His thin lips curved in a smile. \"I seem to recall that you,\ntoo, have a preference for taking vengeance in public.\"\n\n\"If the other emirs demand that he who killed the sultan be punished,\"\nsaid Daoud, \"you will have to sacrifice your servant.\"\n\nBaibars's face tightened. \"They will not. They will accept what you and\nI do.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, if it seems needful to secure your place on the throne,\nyou must give the killer up. You will not have to explain that to me.\nAnd you will still be my lord. My father.\"\n\n\"Ah, Daoud,\" Baibars said. Daoud saw a wetness in both Baibars's eyes\nnow, the sighted and the blind.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDaoud stood beside a spiral pillar near the front of the audience hall\nof the governor of Bilbeis. It was a small chamber, but an elegant one.\nThe floor was of mottled green marble, and pink columns lined the\napproach from the front door to the massive gilded throne on its dais.\n\nMerchants and small landholders, officials in red fezzes, Bedouin\nsheikhs in black robes and burnooses, crowded the hall. Each man held a\npetition scroll for the sultan.\n\nDaoud carried no petition, but the sleeve of his left arm hid, strapped\nto his wrist, a scabbard holding a twisting dagger--a flame dagger, the\nweapon of the Hashishiyya.\n\nHe longed for Qutuz to come into the hall, for the dance of death he had\nrehearsed a thousand times in his mind, to begin.\n\nHe had prayed this morning longer and with greater fervor than he had\nfor many years.\n\n_When_ would Qutuz come?\n\nAt the doorways and around the edges of the room stood warriors of the\nhalkha, the sultan's bodyguard, their steel helmets and breastplates\ninlaid with gold, their tunics bright yellow. What would they do when\nthey saw him strike at Qutuz? They were Mamelukes. They had seen Qutuz's\nfear at the Well of Goliath and his pretensions afterward. But it was\ntheir duty to protect him. Daoud could not guess what feelings would\nmove them.\n\nHere and there around the room rose the spherical white turbans of the\nMameluke emirs who had been at the Well of Goliath. There was Kalawun,\ncalled al-Elfi, the Thousander, because his first master had bought him\nfor the incredible price of a thousand gold dinars, there Bektout,\nbeside a blue-white pillar, another Kipchaq like Baibars. Six or so\nothers talked quietly under the pointed arch of the public entrance to\nthe audience chamber. None of the emirs paid attention to the\npetitioners who streamed past them into the room.\n\nIn the corner of the room farthest from the dais, Baibars stood alone. A\nhead taller than anyone around him, he swung his white-turbaned head\nfrom side to side so that he could survey the room with his one good\neye. His glance seemed to pass over Daoud without seeing him.\n\nA side door to the throne room from the governor's private apartments\nswung open, and two officers of the halkha strode through.\n\nOne of the officers drew himself up and shouted, \"The Beloved of God,\nthe Victor of the Well of Goliath, El Malik al-Mudhaffar Qutuz!\"\n\nThe buzz of conversation in the room at once stilled, and Daoud's\nheartbeat filled his ears.\n\nThen a roar arose as Qutuz entered briskly, arrayed in a bejeweled\ngreen turban and a black and silver robe of honor. His chamberlain, a\nstout man carrying a basket, followed him.\n\nThe petitioners rushed forward, clamoring and waving their scrolls. The\nmen of the halkha made no attempt to hold them back. A merchant in a\nblue robe was the first to reach Qutuz, and he hugged the sultan,\nweeping. He first thrust a small silk bag into Qutuz's hand, which\ndisappeared quickly under the sultan's black robe, then pressed a scroll\nupon him.\n\nQutuz handed the scroll to his chamberlain, who put it into the basket.\n\nThe petitioners were the people of Islam, and it was their right, as it\nhad been since the days of the Prophet, to clamor for their ruler's\nattention. And though they might shout and beg and even manhandle the\nsultan, he must endure it, because these were the richest men of the\ndistrict, the men of highest rank, those on whom the sultan's power in\nthis place depended.\n\nQutuz enjoyed, Daoud knew, playing father to his people. And though one\nmight think the Sultan of El Kahira had wealth enough, he was not averse\nto increasing it with the gifts of gold and jewels offered him on\noccasions like this.\n\nQutuz moved slowly through the petitioners, head high, his oiled beard\npointed like the prow of a majestic ship. A small, indulgent smile\nplayed about his lips. He allowed them to impede his progress to the\nthrone. The petitioners crowded around him, some plucking at his sleeve,\nsome falling at his feet, some pulling at the hem of his robe, even\nkissing it in their urgency.\n\nAnother man, this one a sheikh in desert robes, seized the sultan in an\nembrace, bellowing his entreaty. This time when Qutuz stopped he\ndisappeared behind a forest of upraised arms.\n\nThe babble of voices, each one trying to outshout the other, made\nDaoud's head ache. Men elbowed those beside them and pushed their hands\ninto one another's faces. Daoud even saw one man claw his way up the\nbacks of two who stood in front of him and climb over their shoulders to\nget closer to Qutuz.\n\nFrom his position near the front of the hall Daoud could catch only\nglimpses of the sultan's green turban from time to time and follow his\nprogress by watching where the turmoil was fiercest. The melee was like\none of those towering dust storms that whirl across the desert, and\nQutuz was at the center.\n\nWhen Daoud judged that Qutuz was halfway to the throne, he began to\nmove.\n\nHe plunged now into that black cave where God dwelt somewhere in\ninfinite spaces. Doubt and fear he left at the mouth of that cave. He\nmust give all his strength and will to what he was about to do.\n\nHe charged into the storm around Qutuz. Though these magistrates and\nmerchants were feeble compared to him, their frenzy and the mere weight\nof their struggling bodies formed a wall that took all his strength to\nbreak through. Each man was so intent upon his own desperate need to\nreach the sultan that none of them seemed to feel Daoud forcing his way\npast them.\n\nQutuz saw him coming. The dark brown eyes met Daoud's, questioning,\nfrowning. A Mameluke emir of Daoud's rank did not usually join a crowd\nof petitioners. The sultan's arms and hands were full of scrolls. His\nchamberlain had long since been carried away from him in the crush.\n\n\"Oh, Sultan, grant my prayer!\" Daoud shouted in a loud voice.\n\n_For your death._\n\nQutuz's jaw clenched, and his eyes widened in the beginning of fear as\nDaoud bore down on him.\n\nDaoud had reached the center of the storm. Color and movement whirled\nabout him. Shouts deafened him. He forced his mind to blot out the chaos\nall around and to focus totally on Qutuz. He made himself as oblivious\nto the shrieking men around him as they were to him.\n\nHe threw his arms around the sultan, crushing the satin of his kaftan\nand his armload of scrolls against his body.\n\nWhen Daoud's arms came together behind Qutuz's back, his right hand\nreached into his left sleeve and pulled the dagger from its sheath.\n\nQutuz's hands pushed against Daoud's chest. So tight was Daoud's embrace\nthat he felt the sultan take a deep breath, to cry for help. They were\nlocked together like lovers.\n\nDaoud stretched out his right arm, and then with all the strength in\nthat arm drove the dagger into the sultan's back. He struck for the\ncenter of the back, between two ribs, so that the point would reach and\nstop Qutuz's heart.\n\nHis thrust went true. The strong, lean body jerked violently, then went\nlimp in his arms. Qutuz was a weight against him, sliding downward.\nDaoud was sure he was already dead, because he did not move or cry out.\n\nTriumph blazed up within him. He had done it. He had killed the sultan.\n\nDaoud let go of the dagger, hilt-deep in Qutuz's back. He stepped\nbackward quickly, pressing himself into the crowd around them. His\nheartbeat was thundering in his ears and his knees were quivering.\n\nQutuz toppled toward him as he moved back.\n\n\"The sultan falls!\" a man next to him screamed.\n\nHands reached out to catch Qutuz as he fell. Cries of \"The sultan has\nfainted!\" \"God help us!\" \"The sultan is hurt!\" went up all around Daoud.\n\nHe continued to back away through the crowd. If attacked, he had\ndecided, he would draw his saif and fight. If he must die, he\ndesperately wanted to die fighting, not on the headsman's block.\n\nHe had not truly believed he could strike Qutuz down without being seen,\nbut no one was yet pointing at him.\n\n\"Blood!\" someone shrieked. \"A dagger!\" The shrieks and prayers were\ndeafening.\n\nAll the men who had clustered around the fallen sultan backed away.\nDaoud was carried farther from the dead Qutuz by the crowd. Craning his\nneck over the heads around him, he could see the body lying sprawled\nface down on the green marble floor, a spreading bright red stain in the\nblack and silver robes around the dagger's hilt.\n\nThe babble of voices was so confused that Daoud could no longer tell\nwhat anyone was saying. Mansur ibn Ziri, commander of the halkha, and\nAnis, master of the hunt, pushed their way through to Qutuz's body,\nwhile some men still clutching scrolls ran from the chamber. They must\nfear even being in the room where the sultan was murdered.\n\n_I have killed the sultan._\n\nThough his whole body shook with reaction and his limbs felt weak, his\nheart was full of joy.\n\nHis hand on his sword hilt, Daoud surveyed the large chamber. The\nMameluke emirs were looking, not at Qutuz's body, but at one another.\nAnd they kept glancing at Daoud.\n\n_They_ had seen Daoud throw his arms around Qutuz. They knew who had\nkilled Qutuz. And they knew why he had done it.\n\nBaibars still stood apart in a far corner. His good eye met Daoud's, but\nhis face was a mask.\n\nAs the last of the local men fled the place of death, a silence fell\nover the room. The Mamelukes were alone with the body of their sultan.\nThe men of the halkha, the sultan they were sworn to protect now dead,\nlooked at the emirs. The only voices now were the murmured words of\nMansur and Anis as they bent over Qutuz's body.\n\nWith an effort Mansur pulled the dagger from Qutuz's back. Anis grunted\nwhen he saw the twisting blade.\n\nHeart hammering, Daoud tensed himself. Would Mansur turn and accuse him?\nHe glanced over his shoulder to make sure no one was behind him and took\ngliding steps backward until his shoulders were pressed against a\npillar.\n\nMansur said in a voice that carried through the room, \"The flame dagger.\nOur lord has been struck down by the Hashishiyya.\"\n\nDaoud almost laughed aloud with relief. With an immense effort he held\nhimself rigid, his fists clenched so tightly at his side they hurt.\nMansur was telling everyone who knew what had happened what they were to\ntell everyone who did not know.\n\nWould anyone contradict Mansur? No one did. Relief spread through him.\n\nCarefully, almost delicately, Mansur laid the dagger on the floor beside\nQutuz. He stood up, wiping his hands on his mantle.\n\nWith rapid strides the commander of the halkha crossed the chamber\ntoward Baibars. To arrest him? What choice had Mansur made?\n\nTo bow deeply before Baibars. He made a graceful, sweeping gesture\ntoward the vacant throne.\n\n\"My Lord, the power is yours.\"\n\n_Praise to God!_\n\nBaibars's single-eyed gaze paused for an instant, Daoud saw, as it fell\nupon each of the emirs. In the look he fixed upon each there was both\nquestion and challenge.\n\nSome of the emirs bowed their turbaned heads slightly. Others, like\nKalawun al-Elfi, simply looked back at him in silence, and that was\nassent enough.\n\nBaibars raised his right hand toward the vaulted ceiling, the wide\nsleeve of his robe falling away from his powerful arm.\n\n\"With Your help, O God.\" He did not shout, but his deep voice carried\nthrough the room.\n\nSlowly but with a terrible firmness he walked across the room. So quiet\nwas the audience chamber that Daoud at the other end of the room could\nhear the scrape of Baibars's boots on the three marble steps to the\nthrone. Baibars turned and sat on the throne, resting his hands on its\narms. He leaned back a little, and his eye seemed to rest on some spot\nabove and beyond the heads of those who watched him.\n\nMansur ibn Ziri turned to an officer of the halkha. \"Let runners be sent\nto El Kahira. Let them tell the people, 'Pray for God's mercy on El\nMalik al-Mudhaffar Qutuz. Pray for the long life of your Sultan\nBaibars.'\"\n\n_Let me hail him first_, thought Daoud. _And if he wants to kill me for\nwhat I did, let it be now._\n\nTrembling with exhilaration, he strode through the crowd and up the\ncenter of the room toward the throne. \"Lord Sultan!\" he said in a loud\nvoice, \"El Malik Dahir! Victorious King!\"\n\nHe dropped to his knees and prostrated himself, striking his forehead on\nthe hard, cold floor.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHearing a knock at his chamber door, Daoud rolled up the slip of thin\nparchment and dropped it into the purse at his belt.\n\nSordello entered at his command, greeting and saluting him.\n\n\"I see you are one of us, Messer David.\"\n\n\"One of who?\"\n\nSordello pointed to the writing desk where Daoud had been standing and\nthe sheaf of quill pens. \"One who had his letters. I write down all my\nsongs.\"\n\nDaoud had no wish to feel kinship with Sordello. The bravo had not\nbothered to clean the whiskers from his face for several days, and there\nwas untidy-looking gray stubble, like fur, under his nose and on his\ncheeks and chin. A man should grow a beard, Daoud thought, or keep his\ncheeks smooth.\n\n\"What brings you to me?\" Daoud asked curtly.\n\n\"The Count de Gobignon sent a message to me by way of Ana, the Bulgarian\nwoman. Would you care to read it?\"\n\nDe Gobignon's note read: \"The lady Sophia, Cardinal Ugolini's niece, has\nrepresented herself to me as an honest woman who knows nothing of\npolitics and takes sides neither for nor against the Tartar alliance.\nFind out if she is telling the truth. Report to me in three days' time.\"\n\nDaoud felt pleased with himself. Turning Sordello into a spy for himself\nwas yielding useful results. It was not surprising that the Frenchman\nwas suspicious of Sophia. She was so close to the party opposing the\nalliance; how could he think otherwise? But now, Daoud thought happily,\nthey had the means to put his suspicions to rest.\n\nDaoud handed the note back to Sordello, saying, \"That is short and to\nthe point, but he does not tell you how you are to learn whether Madonna\nSophia is telling him the truth or not.\"\n\n\"I could tell him that I have sung at dinner for the cardinal's\nhousehold,\" said Sordello. \"I could report a conversation at table which\nshows Madonna Sophia to be the innocent he would like to think she is.\"\n\n\"You keep talking about your songs and your singing,\" Daoud said.\n\"Answer me truly--are you any good at those things?\"\n\nSordello shrugged. \"I could claim to be one of the finest trovatores in\nall Italy, but if I did, you would rightfully ask why I have to make my\nliving as a hired man-at-arms. So I will say only that I am good enough\nthat I wish I could spend all my time making poetry and singing.\"\n\nA worthy wish, Daoud thought. Hearing his careful self-estimate, Daoud's\nrespect for the man increased a bit.\n\n\"Then you _will_ sing at the cardinal's table. Your suggestion is a good\none. I will also arrange for you to be with Madonna Sophia at other\ntimes as well, so that you can honestly claim to know something about\nher.\"\n\n\"Very good, Messer David.\" Sordello turned to go, then turned back\nagain. \"Messere?\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Do you think you might send me on another trip to paradise sometime\nsoon?\" The eager light in his eyes sickened Daoud.\n\n\"Do your work well, and I will see that you are properly rewarded.\"\n\nSordello left, and Daoud brooded over his shame at what he had done to\nthe man--turned him into something less than human, less than animal, a\nkind of demon with a single appetite.\n\nAfter a moment he forced himself to put that out of his mind. A fighter\nin jihad, holy war, must do many an ugly thing, but all was for the\ngreater glory of God.\n\n\n\n\nXXXIX\n\n\nThe hymn \"O Salutaris Hostia,\" sung by over a thousand strong voices\nabetted by several thousand more uncertain ones, echoed from the\nhillsides. The entire clergy of Orvieto, from the pope down to the\nlowliest subdeacon, had come out of the city, and so had most of the lay\npopulation. But Daoud's attention was drawn, not by the great procession\ncoming down the cliffside road, or by the crowd in the meadow around\nhim, but by the astonishing change that had come over the landscape.\n\nIt was as if some devastating disease had struck all the growing things\nof the region, from the tallest trees to the very blades of grass. The\nleafless groves raised black, skeletal arms up to the bright blue sky,\nlike men praying. The vineyards on the slopes were gray clumps of\nshrubbery. The meadow grass on which he stood was yellow and brittle; it\nbroke to bits underfoot.\n\nHe had known, of course, that such changes came over the European\nlandscape each winter. But to see such desolation with his own eyes was\nmore amazing, even frightening, than he realized it would be. Soon the\nChristians would be celebrating the birth of Jesus the Messiah, whom\nthey believed was God. Seeing death in the landscape all around him,\nDaoud found it easier to understand why these idolators might feel\ndriven to worship a God who rose from the dead.\n\nHe hoped it would help his mission that the wave of enthusiasm for the\nmiracle at Bolsena had swept everyone in Orvieto from the pope on down.\nHe hoped they would have neither time to think about the Tartars nor\ninterest in dealing with them.\n\nBut this miracle and all the talk about it made him uneasy. The frenzy\nin the Christian faces around him might be turned, he thought, in any\ndirection. It must be the same frenzy that had driven generations of\ncrusaders to hurl themselves against the Dar al-Islam.\n\nFra Tomasso was at the very center of the furor. It was he who had sent\nword from Bolsena that in his judgment the miracle was indeed authentic.\nMight this new preoccupation distract him from his efforts to prevent\nthe alliance?\n\nAnd there was something else, something that revived a terror buried\ndeep in Daoud's soul. Jesus, the crucified God of the Christians,\nstirred in this miracle. As a boy growing up among Muslims, Daoud had\nrenounced belief in the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus. Now he\nfelt again his father's ghostly hand on his shoulder, and the hairs\nlifted on the back of his neck.\n\n\"Look at the sick people and the cripples lining the road,\" said\nLorenzo. \"I would not have thought there could be that many infirm\npeople in Orvieto.\" He and Daoud stood side by side, at a spot where the\nroad between Bolsena and Orvieto passed through a wide valley, their\nhorses tethered in a nearby grove of poplar trees. They had moved back a\nfew paces from the edge of the road to make room for a dozen men and\nwomen on stretchers, wrapped in blankets, who had been carried here by\nFranciscan friars from their hospital.\n\nAll around Lorenzo and Daoud stood Cardinal Ugolini's men-at-arms,\nservants, and maids. Ugolini's entire household was here except for the\nfew of highest rank who would march with the cardinal, who marched\nbehind the pope.\n\nFearing that Scipio would go uncared for, Lorenzo had brought him along,\nholding him on a thick leather leash. The gray boarhound paced nervously\nand growled from time to time.\n\nIn the meadow across the road the pope's servants had erected a pavilion\nwithout walls--just a roof of silk, gold and white, the papal colors,\ncoming to three points held up by a dozen or more stout poles. There\nPope Urban would say mass after receiving the sanctified cloth.\n\nDaoud glanced down the road to where Sophia stood. They had agreed that\nin public it would be best for them to appear far apart from each other.\nShe was dressed as any well-to-do Italian woman might be, her hair\ncovered with a round, flat linen cap bound under her chin, a\nmidnight-blue chemise with long, tight sleeves, and a sleeveless gown of\nlight blue silk over it. Beside Sophia stood a slighter figure in gray\nveil and gown. They had their heads close together, talking.\n\n\"Who is that with Sophia?\" Daoud asked Lorenzo.\n\n\"Oh, Rachel, I think.\" Lorenzo studiously examined Scipio's head for\nfleas.\n\n\"She appears in public with Rachel?\" Daoud said angrily.\n\nLorenzo shrugged. \"No one knows who Rachel is.\" He slapped Scipio's\nrump. \"Sit.\"\n\n\"I did not like Sophia visiting Rachel,\" Daoud said. \"Even less do I\nlike their being seen together in public.\"\n\nTrumpets shrilled and drums sounded as the hymn came to an end. Daoud\nlooked toward Orvieto. The road that wound down past the gray-yellow\nfolds of tufa was filled with people.\n\nAt the head of the procession walked the pope in gold and white, and the\ncardinals of the Sacred College in bright red. The middle of the long\nline was bright with the purples of archbishops and bishops and the\nvariegated raiment of the nobility. The rear was dark with the grays and\nbrowns of common folk.\n\nFrom this distance Daoud could not see Pope Urban's face, but there was\nno mistaking the beehive-shaped mitre with its glittering triple crown.\n\nLucky for the pope the weather was cold, thought Daoud. Wearing those\nheavy vestments on a hot day would surely kill the old man. That today\nhe chose to go on foot showed how much this miracle meant to him.\n\nDaoud turned and looked to the west. The marchers from Bolsena were\nclose, and people were falling to their knees all over the meadow.\n\n_I will have to kneel, too, and seem to worship their idols. Forgive me,\nGod._\n\nDaoud saw Sophia and Rachel drop to their knees.\n\n_Surely they think as little of this as I do._\n\nComing toward Daoud from the west was a great banner that offended his\nevery religious feeling. Painted on the red cloth were the head and\nshoulders of a bearded man, Jesus the Messiah, with huge, staring eyes.\nOn his head was a plaited wreath of thorns, and behind it a disk of\ngold. From the nail holes that pierced his upraised palms fell painted\ndrops of blood.\n\nAn idol, such as the Koran forbade and the Prophet had come into this\nworld to destroy.\n\nAnd then he thought of the great crucifix that hung in the chapel of\nCh\u00e2teau Langmuir outside Ascalon, and his mother taking him by the hand\nto pray before it.\n\n\"Because _He_ lived and died here,\" he remembered her sweet voice\nsaying, \"that is why we are here in this Holy Land.\"\n\nHe felt momentarily dizzy. They, his mother and father and all these\npeople here, thought that the bearded man, with the wounds of\ncrucifixion in his hands, was God. And he had believed it once, too.\n\nNo, God was One. He could not be a Father who reigned in heaven and a\nSon who came down to earth. God was glorious and all-powerful; He could\nnot be crucified. God was the Creator; He could not be part of His\ncreation.\n\nAnd yet--the cold hand still lay upon his shoulder. A gentle hand, but\nit frightened him.\n\nAll around Daoud the infidels were throwing themselves on their knees,\neven on their faces, in the road before the advancing banner. A man in a\nblack robe was walking before the banner bearer. Despite his long gray\nbeard there was something about his staring eyes and wide, downturned\nmouth that reminded Daoud of a fish.\n\nThe bearded priest, Father Kyril, was holding up by its corners a white\nsquare of linen. That, thought Daoud, must be the altar cloth on which\nthe drops of blood had fallen from the wafer of bread. As he walked he\nslowly, solemnly, turned from side to side to allow people on both sides\nof the road to see the cloth.\n\n\"_Kneel_, David, for God's sake!\" Lorenzo ground out beside him.\n\nHis curiosity had made him forget himself. He dropped to his knees,\nfeeling dry grass prick his skin through his silk hose. Lorenzo knelt\nbeside him, gripping the dog's collar. The sick and crippled people\nlying beside the road were wailing and holding up their arms in\nsupplication.\n\nAgain Daoud asked God's forgiveness for his seeming idolatry.\n\nFather Kyril and the altar cloth were only a dozen paces away, and now\nDaoud could see the brown bloodstains on the white cloth. Amazingly they\nappeared to form the profile of a bearded man.\n\nAs a cold wind against his spine, he felt his long-buried fear of the\nwrath of the Christian God.\n\nThe big hound, right beside him, let out a thunderous bark. Daoud\nstarted with surprise. His heart pounded in his chest.\n\nScipio barked and barked, so loudly Daoud put his hands over his ears.\nFather Kyril took a step backward. People who had been venerating the\nbloodstained cloth turned with angry shouts. The hands of the\nmen-at-arms escorting Father Kyril twitched, groping for the weapons\nthey were not carrying.\n\n\"Scipio!\" Lorenzo gave the hound a sharp slap on the side of the head.\nThe dog kept up its barking. Father Kyril had stopped walking and looked\nfrightened. He clutched the stained cloth to his breast. At a word from\nhim, Daoud thought, the crowd would tear to pieces the dog, Lorenzo, and\nperhaps Daoud himself.\n\nLorenzo grabbed Scipio's muzzle with both hands, forcing it shut. Scipio\nkept up a growling through his teeth. Lorenzo growled back, \"Be still!\"\nHe wrestled the dog down until the lean gray head was pressed into the\ngrass.\n\n\"Barking is the only way he knows to greet the Savior,\" said Lorenzo\nwith an ingratiating grin, looking up at the people glaring at him.\n\n\"There could be a devil in that dog,\" a brown-robed friar said\nominously. But Scipio relaxed under Lorenzo's hands, and those around\nDaoud and Lorenzo turned back to the procession.\n\nDaoud was furious. Lorenzo's damned dog had been like a stone in his\nshoe ever since they set out from Lucera. Lorenzo was a valuable man,\nbut he insisted on attaching others to him who caused endless trouble.\nLike the dog. Like Rachel.\n\nA scream rose above the music, so shrill Daoud put his hands over his\nears again.\n\n\"My God! I can see!\" A woman was standing, clasping her hands together\nand flinging them wide again and again. One of the Franciscans threw his\narms around her, whether to rejoice with her or restrain her, Daoud\ncould not tell. But she pushed him away and went stumbling after Father\nKyril. From the way her hands pawed the air, Daoud suspected she could\nnot see very well, but she shouted with joy all the same.\n\nShe joined a crowd of people, many of them waving walking sticks and\ncrutches, others with bloodstained bandages trailing from their hands.\nOne man, Daoud saw to his horror, was missing a foot and was limping\nalong in the dirt road, without the aid of crutch or cane, on one whole\nleg and one stump bound with a dirty cloth that ended at the ankle. His\nface was red, sweat-slick, and blindly ecstatic.\n\nBehind the rejoicing invalids walked rows of clergymen from Bolsena.\nDaoud recognized a familiar figure in the foreground, Fra Tomasso\nd'Aquino, his cheeks crimson with cold and exertion, his black mantle\nblowing in the wind. He had spent the last two weeks, Daoud knew, in\nBolsena investigating the miracle and overseeing preparations for the\naltar cloth to be brought to Pope Urban.\n\nWhat did he think now, Daoud ached to know. Would he still work as hard\nto defeat the Tartar alliance? Did this miracle mean Daoud had gained\nground or lost ground?\n\nA sudden silence fell over the meadow. Pope Urban, with trembling hands\nupraised, approached Father Kyril, whose back was to Daoud.\n\nFather Kyril went down on his knees before the pope, holding up the\nwhite cloth over his head like a banner. Then the pope also knelt,\nsomewhat shakily, with the assistance of two young priests in white\nsurplices and black cassocks. Urban reached up for the cloth and pulled\nit down to his face and kissed it.\n\n_He is seeing that cloth for the first time, and yet he seems to have no\ndoubt that he is looking at the blood of his God that died._\n\nDaoud felt a chill that was colder than the December air.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDaoud pushed his way to the edge of the open pavilion, where the pope,\nassisted by Father Kyril and Fra Tomasso, was saying high mass. A band\nof musicians blew on hautboys and clarions, sawed at vielles, stroked\nharps, and thumped on drums.\n\nThe white cloth with its strange rust-colored stain was stretched on a\ngilded frame above the altar. Daoud felt uneasy whenever he looked at\nit. Just when it seemed he had found the key to wrecking the union of\nTartars and crusaders--a miracle. What did it portend?\n\nMemory showed him his mother and father celebrating Easter, standing\nhand in hand before the altar at Ch\u00e2teau Langmuir, receiving Holy\nCommunion--the Sacred Host--from their chaplain. When he was old enough,\nhis mother had told him he, too, would be allowed to take Jesus into his\nheart by swallowing the Communion wafer. What a strange belief! But at\nthe time it had seemed beautiful.\n\n_I bear witness that God is One, that Muhammad is the Messenger of\nGod...._\n\nHe glanced around the pavilion, and saw many faces he had come to know\nin the last few months. There was Cardinal de Verceuil with his big nose\nand small mouth. There was Ugolini, the size of a child, dressed up as a\ncardinal, blinking rapidly, looking rather bored. In the front row of\nstanding worshipers were John and Philip, the Tartars, in silk robes.\nBeside them, Friar Mathieu, the Franciscan, cleverest of Daoud's\nopponents. Daoud gauged him to be a genuinely holy man, if an infidel\ncould be called holy.\n\nAnd next to him was the pale young face of the Count de Gobignon.\n\nAs Daoud looked at him, de Gobignon looked back, and his eyes widened\nslightly.\n\n_One day, Count, you will die by my hand._\n\nThe mass began, and even though there must have been five thousand\npeople in the valley, there was complete silence. The quiet was eerie.\nAt a Muslim religious celebration this large, the crowd would be\nchanting in unison, there would be music, dervishes singing and dancing;\nimpromptu sermons would be delivered in various parts of the crowd by\nmullahs or by ordinary men moved to speak. Here all was focused on the\ncenter.\n\nPope Urban rose to speak. He had removed his mitre to say mass. His\nwhite hair, his long beard, and his trailing mustache seemed much more\nsparse than they had been when Daoud had first seen the pope, last\nsummer. His face was as pale as his hair, and his hands trembled.\n\nA few months ago Daoud had heard Urban's voice rise robustly from the\ncenter of his body. Today his voice was high and thin and seemed to come\nfrom his throat. He told the story of the miracle of Bolsena, and\nexplained that Father Kyril was a priest from Bohemia who had developed\ndoubts about whether Christ was really present in each and every\nconsecrated Communion wafer. Could a small piece of bread really become\nthe body of Jesus when a priest said a few words over it?\n\n_Where is the illness?_ Daoud's Sufi-trained eye told him it was deep\nwithin Pope Urban; it had sunk its claws into his chest.\n\n_I do not think this pope has long to live._\n\nUgolini had told Daoud that Urban wanted desperately, before he himself\ndied, to strike a death blow against the Hohenstaufen family. He wanted\nCount Charles d'Anjou, brother of the King of France, to wrest the crown\nof Sicily from Manfred, but King Louis had thus far forbidden his\nbrother to make war on Manfred.\n\nKing Louis wanted a different war, a joint war of Christians and Tartars\nagainst Islam. Thus far, the pope had withheld his approval of any\nChristian monarch's allying himself with the Tartars.\n\nAs Urban heard the approaching wings of the Angel of Death, might he be\nmore inclined to grant Louis what he wanted?\n\nThe crowd was no longer silent. Daoud heard waves of murmuring run\nthrough it as people relayed the pope's words to those who were too far\naway to hear him. He noticed now the hawklike profile of the Contessa di\nMonaldeschi. She was seated in a chair in front of the worshipers on the\nside of the pavilion opposite Daoud. A plump young boy in red velvet\nstood beside her.\n\nSeeing her, Daoud looked for Marco di Filippeschi. He could not be sure,\nbut the back of a dark head on this side of the pavilion looked like\nthat of the Filippeschi chieftain. Those organizing this ceremony would,\nof course, be careful to separate the leaders of the two feuding\nfamilies.\n\nPope Urban continued: Father Kyril, realizing that he was doomed to\neternal damnation if he did not overcome his doubts, had set out on a\npilgrimage to Rome. But Rome had fallen on evil days, its streets turned\ninto battlefields by the Ghibellini followers of the vile Hohenstaufens,\nand Father Kyril found no peace there. He decided to ask the prayers of\nthe pope himself at Orvieto. That decision was rewarded before he even\nreached here. Two months ago, while saying mass at Bolsena, on his way\nto Orvieto, and praying that his doubts be resolved, Father Kyril raised\nthe Sacred Host over his head after the Consecration, and hundreds of\nwitnesses saw drops of blood fall from it to the cloth spread on the\naltar.\n\nAnd now--Pope Urban gestured to the cloth spread above the altar--we can\nbehold with our own eyes the blood of Christ Himself and see this\nproof--which, having faith, we should not need to see--that Jesus lives\nin the Blessed Sacrament.\n\n\"We propose to offer triple thanks to God for His generosity in granting\nus this miracle,\" said Pope Urban. \"First, let the day on which Father\nKyril saw the Host bleed be celebrated henceforward as the feast of the\nBody of Christ, Corpus Christi. Let this be proclaimed throughout\nChristendom.\n\n\"Second, to house and display this most sacred relic, the blood of Our\nSavior Himself, let a great and beautiful new cathedral be built here at\nOrvieto, which will forever be the center for the veneration of the body\nof Christ.\"\n\nDaoud sighed inwardly at the thought of still another great building\ndedicated to idolatry.\n\nYet the chapel at Ch\u00e2teau Langmuir had been such a lovely and quiet\nplace.\n\nAs the pontiff's words were repeated, the murmuring grew louder.\nSomeone near Daoud said, \"But the miracle happened in Bolsena.\" Someone\nelse hushed the person who protested.\n\n_I should not wonder if these cities went to war with each other over\nsuch a relic_, thought Daoud.\n\n\"Finally,\" said Pope Urban, oblivious of the discontent his previous\nproclamation had caused among the citizens of Bolsena, \"we command that\nall priests of Holy Church shall read a special office on the feast of\nCorpus Christi of each year, commemorating this miracle. God has willed\nthat there should be dwelling with us here at Orvieto the most gifted\nscholar and writer of this age, Fra Tomasso d'Aquino.\"\n\nDaoud saw that Fra Tomasso's face was almost as bright a red as a\ncardinal's hat.\n\n\"And we charge our beloved and most gloriously gifted son, Fra Tomasso,\nwith the duty of writing this office.\"\n\nD'Aquino rose heavily from a bench on the right side of the altar.\nPuffing, sweating despite the chill of the day, he bowed to the pope\nwith hands clasped before him.\n\n_A great honor, that must be_, Daoud thought. Fra Tomasso was silent for\nthe moment, but he would write words that would be repeated by thousands\nof priests all over the world as long as Christians celebrated this\nfeast. D'Aquino was more than ever indebted to the pope. If the pope\nwere to want d'Aquino's help in persuading the French to go to war\nagainst Manfred, he would collect that debt.\n\nLooking at Fra Tomasso as he sat listening to Pope Urban talk on about\nhis plans for the feast, for the cathedral, for the office, Daoud saw a\nglow on those rounded features that made him uneasy. Daoud had felt that\nwith Cardinal Ugolini and Fra Tomasso stirring up opposition to the\nalliance throughout Christendom, he had but to wait for the plan to die\nof old age.\n\nHe could no longer be sure of that. Fra Tomasso's opposition to the\nalliance had a fragile basis at best, and this miracle might have\nshattered it.\n\nThe blood of the Messiah had power to change the course of events. Daoud\nfelt himself trembling.\n\n\n\n\nXL\n\n\nDaoud's hands were cold and his heart was racing. He had been waiting\nall morning for Ugolini to come back from the Dominican convent.\n\nHe sat at Ugolini's worktable, trying to read. He had found an old book\nin Arabic in Ugolini's library, the _Aphorisms_ of ibn Zaina, a book\nSaadi had often praised. At another time he would have devoured it, but\nhis mind refused to follow the words. Sending Ugolini to Fra Tomasso was\nhis final effort to learn what had gone wrong and to see what might be\nsaved.\n\nWhat would Fra Tomasso say to Ugolini? At least Ugolini could be trusted\nnot to make things worse, as de Verceuil had for their opponents.\n\nThis was the Christian month of February, and the chill that pervaded\nDaoud's body came from the air around him as well as from his troubled\nspirit. The small wood fire that burned on the hearth beside the table\ndid little to dispel the cold in the room.\n\nIn the two months that followed the coming of the bloodstained altar\ncloth to Orvieto, Tomasso d'Aquino had gradually, but completely,\nreversed himself. According to a Dominican in Ugolini's pay, the\nphilosopher had sent new letters to the European kings confessing that\nhis opposition to an alliance between Christians and Tartars had been an\nerror. At least three Italian cardinals had told Ugolini that Fra\nTomasso had come to them personally with the same message. Cardinal\nGratiano Marchetti whispered that Pope Urban, who did not expect to live\nthrough the winter, had promised the stout friar a voice in the election\nof the next pope. Where Urban had been neutral toward the alliance,\nperhaps even opposed, something now caused him to favor it. Just as the\ntumbling of a single grain of sand could bring a whole dune crashing\ndown to bury a caravan, so those drops of blood at Bolsena had been the\nstart of an avalanche of reversals.\n\nDaoud awaited Ugolini's coming, and the message he bore, as a man\naccused of a capital crime awaits the verdict of his judge.\n\nAnd if it was true that Fra Tomasso had irrevocably turned against them?\nDaoud must begin all over again with a new plan to stop the alliance.\n\nThe fire gave off the sour odor of strange substances Ugolini had\npreviously burned on the hearth. Daoud pushed himself out of the\ncardinal's chair and went to get a breath of fresh air. He opened the\ncasement window and saw Ugolini's sedan chair, borne by four servants,\nturning in toward the door of the mansion.\n\nThe cardinal's chair passed the shop across the street, where rows of\nlarge and small pots, brightly painted with floral designs, were laid\nout on a large blanket. The potter and his wife, bundled up in heavy\ncloaks, were calling out for the cardinal's blessing. Daoud saw a tiny\nhand emerge from the curtains of the sedan chair, closed against the\nFebruary cold. The hand shaped the sign of the cross in the air as the\nshopkeepers fell to their knees.\n\nDaoud wondered whether the potter and his wife felt they had an unlucky\nspot to offer their wares. That was where, last August, de Verceuil's\narchers had shot down two men in the crowd when the Tartars were\nentering the city. And it was in front of that shop, shuttered then for\nthe night, that Alain de Pirenne's body had been found. Had the\nshopkeeper or his wife seen anything, and were they keeping silent only\nout of fear? Months had gone by, but the podesta, d'Ucello, was still\ninvestigating the killing, questioning and requestioning everyone who\nmight know something about it.\n\nDaoud paced the room anxiously until Ugolini came in, throwing his\nfur-trimmed cape and his wide-brimmed red hat to a servant. He sat down\nin the chair Daoud had been using. Daoud closed the door.\n\nAs a man dying of thirst begs for water, Daoud prayed for good news.\n\nBut Ugolini's pale face, haggard eyes, and downturned mouth told a\ndifferent tale. Daoud's heart plunged into despair.\n\n\"Has he turned against us?\" He hated the note of pleading he heard in\nhis voice.\n\nUgolini went to his worktable, sighed, and sat down heavily. His eyes\nseemed to be crossed, staring down his pointed nose at the painted skull\nthat grinned back at him. His restless fingers found the dioptra lying\non the table, and he started to roll the brass tube in his hand.\n\n\"I used every argument I could think of,\" he said. \"I even repeated back\nto him the arguments he used in the letters and sermons he wrote against\nthe Tartars.\"\n\n\"Arguing with Fra Tomasso is like trying wrestle a djinn,\" Daoud said.\n\"I admire your courage in even trying.\"\n\nUgolini raised a finger. \"I thought I was getting somewhere with him. He\nkept trying to change the subject. He kept asking me, if the earth moves\nwhile the sun stands still--he seems to be convinced that is what\nhappens--then what path does the earth follow? I told him that the\nGreeks\"--he stopped and stared at Daoud--\"Oh, never mind the Greeks. The\npoint is, he was mocking me.\"\n\n\"Mocking you?\"\n\n\"Yes, talking about the heavenly bodies. He was referring to that scroll\nyou gave me to present to him, that work of Aristotle. What a waste,\ngiving that to him. What would I not give to have it myself.\"\n\n\"Why did he keep changing the subject? Did he never tell you where he\nstands on the alliance?\"\n\nUgolini closed his eyes and nodded. \"Yes, finally. He said he made a\ngrave mistake opposing the alliance. He said that if Christians do not\nseize this chance, the Tartars may be converted to the religion of\nMohammed, as those in Russia already have been, which would be the worst\nof all possible disasters.\" He opened his eyes and looked at Daoud. \"We\nhave lost him.\"\n\n\"Is there nothing we can do to change his mind?\"\n\n\"I truly believe it is hopeless.\"\n\nHearing those words, Daoud felt drained. He sagged against the wall of\nUgolini's cabinet, wanting to sit on the floor but unable to do so\nbecause then he could not see the cardinal.\n\n\"It is Urban who has done this to us,\" said Ugolini. \"He must have\ndecided that supporting the alliance is the only way he can get French\nhelp against King Manfred. He tempted Fra Tomasso with something far\nmore valuable to him than an old scroll. He offered him greater glory\nand power in the Church.\"\n\nThe Angel of Death, thought Daoud, had done it. Feeling himself mortally\nill, the pope had realized he could no longer bargain with the King of\nFrance on an equal basis. He would have to offer Louis what he wanted,\npermission to ally himself with the Tartars.\n\n\"Will the pope now support the alliance openly?\" If Daoud chose to\nfight, he thought, he would have to strike hard and fast. He would have\nto strike at the Tartars.\n\nDespite the downward turn of his fortunes, Daoud felt a strange\nlightness of heart as he considered the prospect. He had tried every\nother way of preventing Tartars and Christians from forming an\nalliance--persuasion, bribery, the spreading of lies.\n\nNow he could turn to the way he was best at. War.\n\n\"Urban will not come out for the alliance at once,\" said Ugolini.\n\"Before Bolsena, Fra Tomasso and my Italian colleagues in the Sacred\nCollege stirred up so much feeling against the Tartars that Urban would\nlose support all over Europe if he were to call now for a pact between\nChristians and Tartars. So he must move slowly, with Fra Tomasso now\nworking with him, winning approval for the alliance.\"\n\n\"What if the French sent an army to him now?\" Daoud asked.\n\nUgolini laughed. \"Do you think King Louis of France can sow dragon's\nteeth and have an army spring up in his fields overnight? He would have\nto summon the great barons of France. They would have to decide whether\nthey support his cause, then assemble the lesser barons and knights.\nSupplies must be gathered, money found to pay the knights and\nmen-at-arms. It can take years to raise an army big enough to wage a\nwar.\"\n\n_The Mamelukes would be ready to ride in a day._\n\n_How had the crusaders managed to make any inroads at all in the Dar\nal-Islam?_\n\n\"If the pope is not ready to declare for the alliance, there is time,\"\nsaid Daoud. \"Nothing is settled yet.\"\n\n\"Time for what? What will you do now?\"\n\nHe pushed himself away from the wall, went to a mullioned window, and\npulled open one of the casements. To the northwest a tower of orange\nbrick with square battlements looked arrogantly down upon the huddled\nmasses of peaked red roofs. From the tower fluttered the orange and\ngreen banner of the Monaldeschi. There the Tartars were.\n\nHe turned from the window and moved slowly toward Ugolini's table.\n\n\"I am sorry,\" he said as gently as he could. \"This is not ended.\"\n\nUgolini had been playing with the dioptra. He dropped it with a clank.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Fear made his voice shrill and quavering.\n\n\"I mean, I must attack the Palazzo Monaldeschi.\"\n\n\"Attack the Monaldeschi!\" It was almost a scream.\n\nDaoud spread his hands. \"I have no choice.\"\n\nUgolini sprang to his feet. \"Pazzia! You are mad!\"\n\n_It is you who are almost mad, with terror_, Daoud thought. He was going\nto have trouble with Ugolini, no question.\n\nAloud he said only, \"We will discuss it. You can help us plan. Pardon\nme, Your Eminence, while I send for Lorenzo.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"It will have to be late at night, of course,\" said Lorenzo. \"And I\nwould think a Friday evening would be best, when the men-at-arms will be\noff their guard and many of them out carousing. But it finally depends\non when Marco di Filippeschi says his family's men can be ready. They\nneed to buy weapons.\"\n\nDaoud and Lorenzo stood by the cardinal's table while Ugolini paced with\nmany short steps between the windows and the hearth. He muttered to\nhimself, and his hands trembled as he ran them through his tufts of\nwhite hair.\n\n\"What of our men?\" said Daoud.\n\n\"We have over two hundred now, scattered throughout the city,\" said\nLorenzo.\n\n_If I could be in the palazzo before the fighting begins ..._\n\nUgolini stopped his pacing and faced them. \"You talk like moonstruck\nmen! You would unleash a civil war right here in Orvieto?\"\n\n\"Not us, Your Eminence,\" said Lorenzo. \"Have not these two families been\nfighting for generations?\"\n\n\"What is your objection?\" said Daoud gently.\n\nUgolini fixed them with a ferocious glare. \"For six months, half a year,\nI have lain awake imagining arrest, disgrace, torture, execution.\nThrough miracles you have managed to carry out your plans without being\ncaught. Now you want to launch still wilder plans--incredible, fantastic\nthings. I have had enough. God has kept me alive this long. I will not\ntempt Him further.\"\n\n\"My dear Cardinal,\" Daoud said, \"once the Tartars are dead, this will\nall be over. I will go back to Egypt. Lorenzo and Sophia will return to\nManfred's kingdom. You will have nothing further to fear.\"\n\n\"You could have tried to kill the Tartars at any time since they came\nhere,\" said Ugolini. \"Why now?\"\n\n\"I needed to create as much ill will as possible between Christians and\nTartars,\" said Daoud. \"If I had killed the Tartars at once, I could not\nhave had them discredit themselves out of their own mouths. Fra Tomasso\nand your colleagues among the Italian cardinals could not have stirred\nup so much fear and hatred toward them. Now, though, I have done all I\ncan along those lines, and Fra Tomasso is already undoing what together\nwe have accomplished.\"\n\n\"And why involve the Monaldeschi and the Filippeschi?\" Ugolini pressed\nhim.\n\n\"To make it seem that the Tartars have been killed by feuding Italians.\nThen Hulagu Khan will think again about whether he wants such people as\nhis allies.\"\n\nUgolini shook his head. \"I do not have to tell you, of all people, what\nwar is like. And I think Messer Lorenzo, by the way he carries himself,\nhas known battle more than once. You both know that chance rules every\nmoment in war.\"\n\n\"True,\" said Daoud.\n\nAnd if chance decided against them? For a moment he saw Sophia naked,\nbeing torn apart by the torturers' pincers. He almost shuddered, and had\nto hold himself rigid.\n\n\"I take it you intend to be part of this attack on the Monaldeschi,\"\nUgolini went on.\n\n\"I do,\" said Daoud.\n\nUgolini threw up his hands as if Daoud had already proved his case for\nhim. \"Well then, what if someone recognizes you attacking the palace?\"\n\n\"I will not openly lead. I will enter the palace and kill the Tartars.\"\n\n\"So,\" said Ugolini. \"You will not just be somewhere in the street\noutside the Palazzo Monaldeschi. You will be _in the palace_. In the\nmidst of all your enemies. Alone. Attempting to assassinate the Tartars.\nTell me, does that sound like the plan of a reasonable, cautious man to\nyou?\"\n\nDaoud thought it sounded as if he were, to put it as Ugolini had,\ntempting God. But Ugolini did not understand that Daoud had not only the\nskills of Mameluke, but had also received the secret training of the\nHashishiyya fighters, the fedawi, whose powers many in the lands of\nIslam thought magical.\n\n\"I will be masked. I will be dressed in garments that will make it\nalmost impossible to see me. I will not expose myself. I will move in\ndarkness. I have been trained to find my way in darkness as surely as if\nit were sunlight.\"\n\nUgolini shook his head. \"Understand me. I would not go on arguing with\nyou like this did I not feel I am arguing for my life. And Tilia's, and\nthe lives of those who depend on you. You must admit that you might be\ncaptured or killed. My house guest, found trying to murder the Tartar\nambassadors.\"\n\nDaoud spread his hands. \"You would then denounce me. You say you never\nknew what a demon you had taken into your home.\"\n\nUgolini laughed loudly and bitterly. \"Are our opponents fools? Do you\nreally think they would believe me, even for a moment? After perhaps\nhundreds of people have been killed, after a civil war in Orvieto,\nanyone who is even suspect will die. The Monaldeschi, the French, the\nChurch authorities, all will take their revenge. Surely you understand\nthat.\"\n\nDaoud's heart grew cold as he looked along the road Ugolini was\ndescribing and saw defeat, massacre, the hideous deaths of his comrades,\nand beyond that iron waves of crusaders and endless columns of Tartar\nhorsemen sweeping over the Dar al-Islam. And he could not look into\nUgolini's eyes and declare that all would turn out well.\n\nBut what would happen if he did nothing? He looked down that path and\nsaw the same masses of crusaders and Tartars, saw the burning mosques,\nthe emptied cities, the heaps of corpses. He saw the Gray Mosque in El\nKahira ruined, his teacher Saadi hacked to pieces by crusader swords.\n\nThen he heard words Saadi had spoken: _We are God's instruments, by\nwhich He brings about that which He wills. The fool does nothing and\nleaves the outcome to God. The ordinary man acts and prays that God will\ngrant a good result. The wise man acts and leaves the outcome to God._\n\nHe would act.\n\nHe turned to Lorenzo, standing near him by the cardinal's table.\n\n\"Your life is at stake in this. What do you think?\"\n\nLorenzo's face was as grave as Daoud had ever seen it. \"If the\nFilippeschi attack the Palazzo Monaldeschi, they will be driven off. But\nwith more than five hundred men attacking the palace, it will be\nimpossible for the French to guard the Tartars adequately. If you get\nin, kill them, and get out safely, I think we can hide our part in the\nfighting. If you are caught or killed, I think it is as the cardinal\nsays. We are all doomed.\"\n\n\"Exactly!\" cried Ugolini from where he stood behind his table. \"Then why\nrisk it?\"\n\n\"Because we must,\" Lorenzo said to him. \"If we do not stop the alliance\nby force, the pope will strike a bargain with the King of France. There\nwill be a French army marching against my King Manfred, and after that\ncrusaders and Tartars will fall upon Messer David's people.\"\n\nUgolini uttered a deep groan and sank into his chair.\n\nRelief swept over Daoud. He had already decided to make the attempt on\nthe Palazzo Monaldeschi even if Lorenzo opposed it, but to have Lorenzo\nside with him gave him more confidence that he could carry it off.\n\nLorenzo turned those somber eyes to him again. \"It all depends on you. I\nam gambling that you can do it.\"\n\nDaoud felt a powerful warmth toward the Sicilian. There were times when\nhe had wished Lorenzo were not with him, times when he distrusted him.\nThe foolishness of involving them with Rachel and her husband. The fact\nthat Lorenzo was a Jew who had abandoned his religion. Even his dog was\na nuisance. But at this moment to have Lorenzo's support made him feel\nas strong and confident as if the Mameluke orta he commanded had\nsuddenly appeared in Orvieto.\n\nHe grinned at Lorenzo. \"You proved how good a gambler you are by losing\nto de Verceuil.\"\n\nLorenzo chuckled. \"What must we do first?\"\n\nDaoud said, \"Arrange for me to meet secretly with Marco di Filippeschi.\nAnd send word to King Manfred that the pope and the French are about to\nreach agreement on the Tartar alliance, and when they do the French will\ncome pouring into Italy. Tell him now is the time for his Ghibellino\nallies in the north to march on Orvieto.\"\n\nLorenzo nodded. \"I will send one of my men to Lucera.\" He shook his\nhead. \"My God, how I wish I could go myself!\"\n\n\"Once the Tartars are dead,\" Daoud said, \"we will all go home. Now, find\nSordello and send him to my room.\"\n\nAs Daoud left Ugolini's cabinet, he glanced back to see the little\ncardinal slumped over the table, knotting his fingers in his fuzzy white\nhair. He would have to spend more time with him, to build up his\ncourage.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSophia was standing in the hallway when Daoud emerged from his room that\nnight, on his way to meet with the Filippeschi chieftain. He was not\nsurprised to see her. Someone, Ugolini or Lorenzo, would have told her\nabout his new plan. He beckoned her into his room and closed the door.\n\nEach time the thought of defeat arose in his mind, he had felt the\ngreatest anguish over what it would mean for Sophia. That forced him to\nadmit to himself how much he cared for her. Now that he looked into her\namber eyes and told her what he intended to do, the pain he felt was\nsharper than ever. He wanted to persuade her that she had nothing to\nfear. But he knew that would be a lie.\n\nHe tried to keep what he said simple, practical. \"You, like Sordello,\nwill bear witness that Lorenzo and I had gone to Perugia while the\nMonaldeschi palazzo was under siege. Lorenzo has allies in Perugia who\nwill confirm that.\"\n\nSophia stared at him with wide, solemn eyes. \"You are risking\neverything.\" She reached out and seized his hand, gripping it urgently.\n\"If they find out who you are while you are in the Monaldeschi palace,\nit will be the end for all of us.\"\n\nHe felt the strength in her fingers, the softness of her palm, and\nwanted to take her in his arms, but he held himself in check. There\ncould be nothing between them as long as de Gobignon was alive.\n\n\"I know a hundred ways to get into a castle and out again,\" he said,\nwishing there had been time to share with her more of his life. \"Once I\nam inside, I will search out and kill the two Tartars while all the\narmed men are occupied with the fighting outside. And then I will\nleave.\" He spread his hands to show how easy it would be.\n\nInwardly he was ashamed. He was preparing to sacrifice this woman's\nlife, knowing that she might die a terrible death--rape, torture,\nmutilation, public execution. How could he face her at all? That he had\nmade his decision in order to save hundreds of thousands of his people\nfrom slaughter, his faith from destruction, was no comfort at this\nmoment alone with Sophia.\n\n\"Will you fight Simon?\"\n\nHe felt his blood go hot. That she should think at all of de Gobignon at\nthis moment rather than of herself--or of him--made him so angry he\nforgot for a moment his own guilt and fear for her life.\n\n\"The young count will probably be leading the fight on the battlements.\"\nDaoud tasted the venom in what he was about to say, but he could not\nhelp himself. \"It will be quite a shock when he finds the Tartars dead\nand realizes how he has failed.\"\n\nSophia stood breathing hard, her eyes glistening with tears. \"If only\nyou were not--\"\n\nDaoud was already wishing he had not spoken so to her. \"Not what?\"\n\n\"Not blind!\" she cried.\n\nShe turned swiftly and reached for the door handle. But Daoud could not\nlet her go. He was there before her, and he faced her and seized her\nhand.\n\n\"I am not blind,\" he rasped. \"I see that pretending to be what you are\nnot is tearing you apart. I wish we could be our true selves with each\nother--\"\n\n\"We cannot,\" she said bitterly. \"And to speak of it only makes it hurt\nmore. Let me go.\"\n\nHe relaxed his grip on her hand, and she was gone.\n\n_Some day_, he thought. _Some day, Sophia._\n\nLooking at the closed door, Daoud felt an almost unbearable inner pain.\nHe had thrust her at Simon. He had lashed out at her, hurt her unjustly.\nHaving done that to her, he was about to put her in far worse danger.\n\nHow could he claim, even in the secrecy of his own heart, that he loved\nher?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDaoud could barely see Marco di Filippeschi in the darkness. Moonlight\ntouched the gold medallion that hung from Marco's neck and on the silver\nbadge in his cap. For the rest he was a figure carved out of shadow.\nDespite the full moon, this narrow alleyway between a stone house and\nthe city wall was almost as black as the bottom of a well.\n\nDaoud's Hashishiyya-trained senses needed no light to see by. He had\nlearned to see with his ears as well as with his sense of smell. He\ncould sense what weapons Marco di Filippeschi was wearing--a shortsword\nand two daggers at his belt, and, from the difference in footfalls, a\nthird dagger in a sheath in his right boot. He knew the position of\nMarco's hands, and he knew that Marco had told the truth when he said he\nhad come to this rendezvous alone.\n\nLorenzo had assured him that Marco would leap like a hungry wolf at any\nchance to avenge himself on the Monaldeschi. But Daoud wondered, would\nthe volatile young clan chieftain really be willing to undertake an\nattack on the Monaldeschi that had more chance of failing than\nsucceeding?\n\n\"I can offer you over two hundred lusty bravos collected by one who is\nknown to you,\" Daoud said. Hoping to make Marco a little less certain\nabout who his ultimate benefactor was, he avoided naming Giancarlo.\nMarco could destroy Daoud and all his comrades by revealing the identity\nof the man who had incited his attack on the Monaldeschi. If he were\ncaptured and tortured, strong and fierce though he might be, it was\nlikely he would tell everything.\n\nDaoud reached into the purse at his belt, where he had earlier put two\nemeralds. He held them out in his open palm so that the moonlight\nglistened on their polished surfaces.\n\n\"Please accept these as a gift,\" he said. \"If you decide to assault the\nPalazzo Monaldeschi, your preparations will be costly.\"\n\nThe jewels must be called a gift. The capo della famiglia Filippeschi\nwas not a man you paid to do your work for you.\n\nMarco's hand closed around the emeralds, and his other hand seized\nDaoud's forearm.\n\n\"I shall spend this on weapons,\" he said. \"Crossbows to kill more\nMonaldeschi. Stone guns to batter down their walls. I care not what\nprice I must pay.\"\n\n_That is good_, thought Daoud, _because the price may be very high_.\n\n\"I will need until spring,\" Marco continued. \"It will take that long to\nbuy the weapons. I must work slowly and quietly so the old vulture does\nnot get wind of what I am doing.\"\n\n\"The Monaldeschi are collaborating with this French pope and his French\ncardinals,\" Daoud said to spur Marco on. \"And the French party is about\nto invite an army under Charles of Anjou into Italy.\"\n\n\"Damn the French!\" said Marco. \"And damn that putana and her family for\nworking with them.\"\n\n\"Also, as everyone knows,\" Daoud said, \"the pope has not long to live.\nStrike a blow now for Italy, and you will frighten the cardinals at a\ntime when they will soon be choosing the next pope. So your attack had\nbetter come no later than spring.\"\n\n\"We Filippeschi are as loyal to the papacy as the Monaldeschi. Perhaps\nmore.\"\n\n\"My master, whom I prefer not to name,\" said Daoud, knowing that Marco\nwould think he meant King Manfred, \"does not wish to see the pope in\nleague with the French.\"\n\n\"This war of Guelfi and Ghibellini leaves us prey to every French and\nGerman ladrone who wants to come down and loot our country,\" said Marco.\nObviously he had no great love for the Hohenstaufens, either.\n\n\"How will you start the fighting?\" Daoud asked him.\n\n\"Two or three of my cousins will take a walk in the piazza before the\nPalazzo Monaldeschi on a Friday evening, when everybody strolls,\" Marco\nsaid. \"If their mere presence in that part of the city does not cause an\nincident, they will step on a few toes.\"\n\n\"It will take some courage to go into the lion's den,\" Daoud remarked.\n\nThe young Filippeschi chieftain laughed ruefully. \"We possess more of\ncourage than we do of anything else.\"\n\nIf they did not also possess some prudence and the ability to keep a\nsecret, Daoud thought, everything was lost.\n\n\n\n\nXLI\n\n\nThe stained glass in the cathedral's deeply recessed rear windows broke\nthe sunlight of the April morning into blue, yellow, and red beams.\nWalking slowly through the nave, Simon wondered why Sordello had\ninsisted this time on meeting him in person in the cathedral rather than\nsending his news through Ana. The departure from their routine gave\nSimon an uneasy feeling that some disaster was about to befall him.\n\nThe miraculous altar cloth with the dark spots in its center was mounted\nin a gilded frame above the altar. On each side of it a tall white\ncandle burned. At the foot of the altar two priests in black cassocks\nand white surplices knelt on benches, their heads resting on their\nfolded arms so that it was impossible to tell whether they were sleeping\nor praying. In the four months since the cloth had been brought to\nOrvieto, it had never been left unattended. The pope had decreed that\npriests in hourly shifts would watch day and night before the blood of\nthe Savior.\n\nSimon suspected reverence was not the only motive for this vigil. He\nknew several tales of famous relics being stolen, not only from pious\nzeal, but because relics attracted pilgrims and their money. And the\npeople of Bolsena might still be jealous.\n\nHearing footsteps behind him, Simon approached the altar, genuflected,\nand walked into the shadows on the left side of the cathedral. He paused\nby a fluted pillar that rose like a tree trunk. Approaching him was a\nbeggar in a tattered gray cloak that hung to his ankles. A deep hood hid\nhis face. The man gripped Simon's arm. The face of Sordello looked out\nof the shadows under the hood. Simon pulled his arm free.\n\n\"I have something important to tell Your Signory, but it is not about\nCardinal Ugolini and his circle.\" Sordello spoke in a hoarse whisper.\n\"The Filippeschi are going to make a surprise attack on the Palazzo\nMonaldeschi.\"\n\nThe news hit Simon like a kick in the belly.\n\nThe Tartars--and he and his men--would be caught in the middle. He\nthought back to Alain's murder. Even since then he had felt that Orvieto\ncould be a death trap for him and all his men.\n\nSimon leaned forward to peer into Sordello's pinkish eyes. \"When will\nthe attack come?\"\n\n\"Tonight, after vespers.\"\n\n_Tonight!_ Now Simon's blood froze. _No time! No time!_ a voice shrieked\ninside him. He wanted to run back to the palace shouting warnings all\nthe way. It took all his strength to keep him standing with Sordello, to\nforce his mind, galloping like a runaway horse, to slow down and frame\nquestions.\n\n\"How did you find out?\"\n\n\"Tavern talk. Some of Giancarlo's hired bravos were drinking with\nFilippeschi men.\"\n\nSweat that felt like a cold rain broke out all over Simon's body. The\nTartars--he must get them out of the Monaldeschi palace. But the\ncontessa had been his hostess for many months. He himself had no quarrel\nwith the Filippeschi, but he had an obligation to defend the contessa.\n\n\"How long have you known this?\"\n\n\"I just learned it last night, but they must have been preparing for\nmonths.\"\n\n\"Why _now_?\"\n\nSordello's eyes met his. \"The Filippeschi think the Monaldeschi are\nbetraying Italy to you French.\"\n\nIf the Filippeschi were attacking now because he was at the Palazzo\nMonaldeschi, then indeed he had a quarrel with them, whether or not he\nwanted one. And it was his fault, in a sense, that the contessa was in\ndanger.\n\n\"Betraying Italy to the French? What does that mean?\"\n\nSordello ticked off points on his fingers. \"The pope is French. He asks\nthe contessa to take the Tartars into her house. Then you and Cardinal\nde Verceuil come with the Tartars. And now everyone has heard that the\npope wants Charles d'Anjou to come in and take Sicily and southern Italy\nfrom King Manfred. The Filippeschi want to turn the tide now, they say,\nbefore the French own all of Italy.\"\n\nThe face of Uncle Charles flashed vividly before Simon's mind, the big\nnose, the staring eyes. When they had talked of this mission over a year\nago at the Louvre, he had said nothing of Sicily, had spoken only of the\nliberation of Jerusalem and the destruction of Islam. Was Sicily what he\nreally wanted--or perhaps even all of Italy?\n\nWhat should he do? It struck Simon with frightening force that there was\nno one but he to take the responsibility. He was in command. He must\nmake the plans and the decisions. His heart thudded frantically, and he\nprayed that Sordello could not see the consternation that filled him.\n\n\"What forces do they have, what weapons?\"\n\nSordello shook his head. \"As to that, Your Signory, I know very little.\nI have been at Cardinal Ugolini's mansion, not among the Filippeschi. I\nwould guess they must have at least five hundred men and siege weapons.\nThey would be mad to start this thing with less.\"\n\n\"Five hundred men and siege weapons!\"\n\nSimon pictured the Monaldeschi palace with its great tower crumbling\nunder a bombardment of boulders. He saw men swarming over it like ants.\nHe saw the defenders lying dead in the ruins--de Puys, Thierry, the\nArmenians, the Venetians--himself. He saw the Tartars with their throats\ncut.\n\nAgain he felt the urge to run back to the palace to prepare at once.\nAgain he suppressed the urge so he could ask more questions.\n\n\"Where did they get such forces?\"\n\nSordello shrugged. \"They are a big family. They have relatives in the\noutlying towns.\"\n\nSimon bent down to look deep into Sordello's bloodshot eyes. \"Are you\nsure Ugolini and David of Trebizond and the rest are not involved? If we\nFrench and the Tartars are the provocation, Ugolini must be behind\nthis.\"\n\nSordello tapped his cheek just under his right eye. \"Your Signory, I\nwatch them as closely as those priests watch the miraculous altar cloth.\nUgolini has been in despair all winter, since Fra Tomasso changed sides.\nHe buries himself in his cabinet with his magical instruments. David\nhas lost interest in the Tartars and thinks only about trade. He talks\nto Giancarlo of making up a caravan to go back to Trebizond. The two of\nthem left for Perugia on business yesterday.\"\n\n\"What about Giancarlo's bravos?\"\n\n\"Altogether, Giancarlo has hired only a dozen such men, including\nmyself. We guard David's goods and escort his caravans.\" Sordello waved\na hand in dismissal.\n\n\"And what of the cardinal's niece?\" said Simon, trying not to sound\nespecially interested.\n\nSordello shrugged. \"That lovely lady stays apart. She goes to church,\nshe reads, she paints.\"\n\nWorried though he was about the impending Filippeschi attack, Simon's\nheart felt lightened by joy. Sophia was innocent. His love for her was\nvindicated. After this was over he would come to her and broach\nmarriage.\n\n\"You must watch Madonna Sophia for me,\" Simon said. \"Stay close to her.\nDo not let her go out tonight.\"\n\n\"Stay close to her.\" Sordello grinned. \"That will not be hard, Your\nSignory.\"\n\nSimon seized the front of Sordello's tunic. \"Never speak that way of\nher.\"\n\nSordello jerked away from Simon and brushed his tunic. \"I am a man, Your\nSignory. Do not treat me like a slave.\" The coarse face was pale with\noutraged pride.\n\n_He forgets his place so easily. But there is no one else to guard\nSophia for me._\n\n\"I want you to be thinking about her safety, and that alone,\" he said in\na calmer voice.\n\nSordello bowed. \"I understand, Your Signory.\" But resentment still\nburned in his narrowed eyes.\n\nIn the midst of his fear, like a single candle glowing in a pitch-black\ncathedral, Simon felt a tingle of anticipation. There was something in\nhim, deeply buried but powerful, that keenly looked forward to taking\ncommand in battle.\n\n\"If you learn any more, try to get word to me,\" he told Sordello.\n\nHe turned and hurried through the nave of the cathedral to the front\ndoors, still holding in check the urge to run.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"For them to attack is pazzia,\" said the contessa. \"We have twice the\nmen-at-arms they do. Yet I pray God this rumor is true. By tomorrow\nmorning Marco di Filippeschi will be hanging from our battlements.\" The\ncords in her neck stood out, her nose was thrust forward like a falcon's\nbeak, and her eyes glittered.\n\nSimon said, \"With respect, Contessa, they must have more men than you\ndo. I was told they might have five hundred. And siege machines.\"\n\nThey were seated in the small council room of the Monaldeschi\npalace--Simon, the contessa, de Verceuil, Sire Henri de Puys, and Friar\nMathieu--around a circular table of warm brown wood.\n\n\"But surely we have better men,\" said Henri de Puys in French. \"What\nsort of fighters could these Philippe-whatever-they-are muster?\nRoutiers, highwaymen?\"\n\nFriar Mathieu turned to de Verceuil. \"Might I suggest that Your Eminence\nuse your influence with Pope Urban. Perhaps his holiness can stop this\nbattle.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said de Verceuil. \"I will try to speak to him. But he is sick,\nand pays little attention to anything.\"\n\n_Probably de Verceuil is annoyed because he did not think first of going\nto the pope._\n\n\"I should think it would endanger his health even more if a war broke\nout in Orvieto,\" said Friar Mathieu.\n\n\"I will _see_ him,\" said de Verceuil. \"But I will also arm myself and my\nmen to help defend this place.\"\n\nSimon expected de Verceuil to next propose himself as commander of the\ndefense, but, to his delight, the cardinal had nothing more to say. Then\nthe suspicion crossed his mind that de Verceuil did not want to have to\ntake the blame in case of defeat.\n\n\"Grazie, Your Eminence,\" said the contessa.\n\nSimon said, \"I must go to Signore d'Ucello. Surely the podesta will not\nlet civil war break out in the city he governs.\"\n\nThe contessa laughed, a knowing cackle. \"Go to him if you like, but you\nwaste your time. He cannot--will not--stop the Filippeschi. He has\nFilippeschi relatives, you know. But he could not stop me, either, if I\nchose to attack them.\"\n\nFriar Mathieu said, \"Perhaps we should take the ambassadors to the papal\npalace. That would get them out of harm's way until this is over.\"\n\nSimon's body went rigid. The Tartars were his responsibility. He would\nnever give them up to the pope's men-at-arms.\n\n\"No!\" he said. \"The duty of guarding them is mine, and I will surrender\nit to no one.\"\n\nDe Puys struck the table with his open palm. \"Bravely spoken,\nMonseigneur.\"\n\nFriar Mathieu sighed.\n\nDe Verceuil pointed a finger at Simon. \"Count, you have no right to risk\nthe ambassadors' lives just for your own glory.\"\n\nSimon looked around the table. He was the youngest person here, and they\nwere treating him like a child. He remembered the Doge Zeno's threat to\nhave him thrown into the water of Venice's San Marco Canal. He\nremembered the many times de Verceuil had been overbearing with him. To\nthink _that_ man would accuse anyone else of being too concerned with\nhis own glory.\n\nHe was about to shout defiance when he thought of royal councils he had\nattended as a page to King Louis. Those close to the king often\ndisagreed with him, but they usually ended up doing what he wanted.\nLouis was perhaps the strongest man, in his gentle way, Simon had ever\nmet, but he had never heard him raise his voice.\n\nInstead of defying de Verceuil and the others, he tried to speak with\ndignity, even humility, as King Louis himself might.\n\n\"His Majesty's brother, Count Charles, entrusted this task to me. Shall\nI give it up at the first threat? Shall I turn over the ambassadors'\nprotection to men unknown to me, some of whom may be moved by the same\nhatred of us French that moves the Filippeschi? I have a duty not to let\nthe ambassadors go beyond the walls I guard.\"\n\nWhen he finished there was silence.\n\nFriar Mathieu said, \"Count Simon makes an excellent point. John and\nPhilip may well be safer guarded by our men, even under attack.\"\n\nNow that they had agreed, Simon's heart sank. If the Tartars were killed\nin the coming battle because he had insisted on keeping them in the\npalace, he would bear the guilt. Instead of restoring his name, he would\nend by plunging it deeper into the mire.\n\nDe Puys looked from Simon to the cardinal and said, \"Perhaps our knights\nand crossbowmen could go with the Tartars to the Pope's palace.\"\n\n\"No!\" cried the contessa. \"Now, when I am attacked because I opened my\nhome to the Tartars and the French, will you all abandon me? All the men\nof my family are dead but the boy Vittorio.\" She turned to Simon and\nseized his wrist with her clawlike hand. \"You must stay and defend me.\nYou must be my cavaliere.\"\n\nSimon pressed her hand in both of his and saw tears running down her\nwithered cheeks.\n\n\"I would not think of leaving you, Contessa.\"\n\n\"But, Contessa,\" said Friar Mathieu, \"if the Tartars were to leave your\npalace, the Filippeschi might not attack you.\"\n\n\"No, no.\" The contessa shook her head. \"If they think they are strong\nenough to attack me, they will. They have long sought to kill me and\nVittorio. Canaglia! May God send that little bastard Marco and all the\nFilippeschi straight to hell!\"\n\nFriar Mathieu winced and made the sign of the cross.\n\nInwardly Simon winced, too, as he always did at the word bastard. But,\nbastard or not, he was about to command a palace under siege. He felt\nhis chest swelling at the thought.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe candlelit audience chamber of the podesta was hung with somber\nmaroon drapes drawn against the night air. On the wall behind d'Ucello,\na tapestry depicted Jesus and Barabbas being offered to the crowd in\nJerusalem while Pilate washed his hands. Simon had never seen such a\nlarge scene with such finely embroidered figures, and he admired it\naloud.\n\n\"I keep it here as a reminder that a judge who heeds the popular clamor\nmay make a grave error,\" said the small man behind the large table. \"How\nmay I serve you, Count?\"\n\nAs Simon told the podesta what he knew of the planned Filippeschi\nassault on the contessa's palace, d'Ucello leaned back in a tall chair\nthat seemed too big for him, his eyes distant, the corners of his mouth\nturned down under his thin mustache.\n\nWhen Simon finished, d'Ucello asked, \"Are Cardinal Ugolini or any of his\nguests involved in this?\"\n\n_The very question I asked Sordello. Interesting that the podesta shares\nmy suspicions._\n\n\"The person who warned me said they were not.\"\n\nD'Ucello peered at him. \"And who warned you?\"\n\n\"I would rather not say. I have an informant in Cardinal Ugolini's\nhousehold.\"\n\n\"Really? Good for you.\" The podesta gave him a look of amused respect\nthat kindled a warm glow of pride in him. \"Well, Your Signory, if there\nis a battle between the Monaldeschi and the Filippeschi, I can do\nnothing about it.\"\n\nSimon was swept by strange mixed feelings. He was ready to do almost\nanything to prevent the coming battle. But in the midst of his despair\nat d'Ucello's refusal to help, he kept seeing himself in armor rallying\nhis men on the Monaldeschi battlements.\n\nBut he had to try to persuade d'Ucello to help. He could not leave\nwithout having done his best.\n\n\"Is it not your duty to keep the peace in Orvieto?\"\n\n\"All my watchmen together are not a tenth of the number of armed men the\nMonaldeschi and the Filippeschi can put into the streets. I assure you\nthat if the watch did try to stop the fight, the Monaldeschi and the\nFilippeschi would join forces and annihilate my men before they went on\nto tear each other to pieces. Look, Your Signory, mine is a lifetime\nappointment, which means that how long I live depends on how well I\nplease those who appointed me. The families wish me to prevent or punish\nfraud, theft, rape, and murder. But when the families have quarrels that\ncan be settled only by bloodshed, they want no interference. Did the\ncontessa send you here to appeal for my help?\"\n\n\"No, she told me you could not stop the Filippeschi,\" said Simon,\nappalled at this glimpse of the chaos that lay under the pretty surface\nof this town.\n\nD'Ucello nodded with a look of satisfaction. \"Of course. No doubt she\nsees this as her chance to kill off Marco di Filippeschi, something she\nhas longed to do for years. I cannot do what you ask. I know the limits\nof my power.\"\n\nPower, thought Simon. Brute strength. That was what would decide this\nclash, and all he could do was make sure his side was stronger. He felt\na resolve, at once grim and gleeful, growing inside him.\n\nHe stood up and inclined his head. The stout little man rose and bowed\nback.\n\n\"Then I cannot rely on you?\" Simon said.\n\nD'Ucello shrugged. \"I am still trying to discover the murderer of your\ncompanion. I have learned that neither David of Trebizond nor his\nservant, Giancarlo, were in Cardinal Ugolini's palace when your friend\nwas killed. I think tonight while the Monaldeschi and the Filippeschi\nare at each other's throats, the best place for me would be at\nUgolini's, asking those two worthies where they were that night. If I\ncannot find out, perhaps your informant in that household could help.\nWhy not ask her?\"\n\n_He thinks I was talking about Sophia._\n\nSimon wished he could go to Sophia. What if he were killed tonight and\nnever saw her again? He wished there was at least time to send her a\npoem.\n\nD'Ucello had probably guessed that Simon was visiting Sophia when Alain\nwas murdered. Simon felt his face grow hot with chagrin. He had failed\nto keep his secret--his and Sophia's.\n\nHe remembered Sordello telling him that David and Giancarlo had gone to\nPerugia. Simon could save d'Ucello from a waste of time by telling him\nthat.\n\n_But why bother? He's been no help to me._\n\nAngry with the podesta and with himself, and unwilling to yield any more\ninformation to the little man, Simon took his leave.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith two of his knights, the Sires de Borione and de Vilbiz, flanking\nhim, Simon hurried back from the podesta's palace to the Palazzo\nMonaldeschi. They looked over their shoulders so often as they strode\nthrough the darkening street that Simon began to feel they were looking\nbackward as much as forward. But no bravos sprang at them from ambush,\nno arrows flew from housetops. Indeed, the streets were unusually quiet\nand empty for late Saturday afternoon, with the clink of the knights'\nspurs and the tramp of their heels on the cobbles the loudest sounds of\nall.\n\nWindows were shuttered, doors closed tight. The whole neighborhood,\nthought Simon, must be aware of what was about to happen.\n\nThey turned a corner into the square before the Monaldeschi palace and\nheard the sound of hammers. Simon had ordered de Puys to supervise the\nbuilding of slanting wooden screens above the battlements to be covered\nwith wet blankets to protect the roof from fire arrows. The job was\nalmost done, and Simon reminded himself to compliment de Puys when he\nsaw him.\n\nHis first task here at the palace was to insure the safety of the\nTartars. He had already decided that the safest place in the palace was\nthe spice pantry in the cellar.\n\nAnd what if the palace were overwhelmed and the Tartars were trapped and\nkilled in the spice pantry? Simon made up his mind that he himself would\nnot surrender. The Filippeschi would have to kill him to get to the\nTartars.\n\nFriar Mathieu answered Simon's knock. Simon had never seen the Tartars'\nchambers before, and he was shocked. Mattresses covered with blankets\nlay along the walls. Rugs and cushions were scattered about, but there\nwas no bed, table, or chair to be seen. An overpowering smell of burnt\nmeat filled the first room Simon entered. In the center of the wooden\nfloor an area about three feet across was covered with blackened\nflagstones, and atop the stones was a heap of charred wood. Beside this\ncrude hearth was a pile of broken animal bones, melon rinds, and other\nrefuse. An open wine barrel added its sweetish smell to the general odor\nof smoke and decay.\n\nSimon wondered whether the contessa had seen this squalor. She had shown\nthe Tartars special favor, giving them three rooms in the northwest\ncorner of the third floor. In most palaces a single room was the most\neven a very distinguished visitor could expect. If she thought they were\nsavages after David of Trebizond had baited them at her reception, what\nwould she think after seeing this pigsty?\n\nJohn and Philip rose at Simon's entrance and bowed, smiling broadly.\nThey seemed not the least embarrassed by the foul condition of their\nchambers. Simon bowed back, trying also to smile.\n\n\"If Cardinal Ugolini were to show these rooms to the Sacred College,\nmany of the cardinals would join him in detesting the Tartars,\" Simon\nsaid to Friar Mathieu. \"A wonder the smoke has not smothered them.\"\n\nWith a wry smile Friar Mathieu pointed at the ceiling. An irregular hole\nhad been broken through above the Tartars' hearth.\n\n\"Fortunately for everyone, they are on the top floor of the palace,\" the\nFranciscan said. \"All they have tried to do is reproduce the kind of\nhome they are used to living in, even to the smoke hole in the roof.\"\n\nThe white-bearded John said something in the Tartar tongue to Friar\nMathieu.\n\n\"They have heard of the coming fight,\" the Franciscan said. \"They want\nweapons and a place on the battlements. They say it is their duty as\nguests to defend their hostess, the contessa.\"\n\nSimon tensed himself for trouble. He had feared this. He chose his words\ncarefully.\n\n\"I am sure the contessa will be overwhelmed with gratitude when I tell\nher of such a gracious offer. But we would not want to have to answer to\nthe mighty Hulagu Khan if something happened to them or to their noble\nmission. Tell them that, and that it is _our_ duty to keep _them_ safe.\nThere is a stone storeroom underneath the kitchen, a spice pantry. I\nhave explored the palace, and that is the securest place. They must go\nthere the moment the Filippeschi attack. They should take the Armenians\nwith them.\"\n\nThe Tartars looked angry and shouted vigorous staccato protests when\nFriar Mathieu translated this. Philip, the younger, black-haired one,\nespecially addressed himself to Simon. Philip seized the oblong gold\ntablet of office that hung around his neck and shook it at Simon.\n\n\"He reminds you that his title is Baghadur, which means Valiant. He says\nyou insult him by asking him to hide in the cellar. Among his people\nnobody hides. Even the women and children fight.\"\n\nSimon felt his assurance collapsing. What if the Tartars simply refused\nto seek safety? He could not put them in chains.\n\nEarnestly he said, \"Tell them it is their duty to their khan to stay\nalive and continue negotiations. Be as courteous as you have the power\nto be in their language.\"\n\n\"Oh, I am being very polite. One always is, with them.\"\n\nAfter another exchange Friar Mathieu said, \"They say Hulagu Khan would\nexpect them to fight.\"\n\nSimon had a sudden inspiration. \"Tell them that if they were to fight\nand if anything happened to them, even the slightest injury, the King of\nFrance would cut my head off.\"\n\nThere was a particle of truth in that, Simon thought as Friar Mathieu\ntranslated. Kindly as King Louis was, decapitation would be preferable\nto facing his reproach if Simon's weakness caused the Tartars' death.\n\nJohn shrugged and answered Friar Mathieu quietly. Simon held his breath,\npraying that this last effort would work.\n\nFriar Mathieu said, \"John says that you are a brave young warrior, and\nit would be a shame to have your head cut off when you have a lifetime\nof battles ahead of you. For your sake they will forgo the pleasure of\nthis fight. But they insist on taking only two guards with them. They\ninsist that the rest of their men fight beside yours.\"\n\nRelief washed over Simon. He hoped he would be able to think as quickly\nin the coming battle as he had just then.\n\n\"I can use their other men. Have whatever the ambassadors need for their\ncomfort carried to the spice pantry.\" He looked again at the pile of\ngarbage. \"Tell them they will be next to the kitchen. They should like\nthat.\"\n\n\n\n\nXLII\n\n\n\"Count Simon!\" Simon recognized the crackling voice of the contessa.\n\nShe was wearing a floor-length gown of deep purple velvet. She held up a\ndisk-shaped bronze medallion on a silver chain.\n\n\"Please take this, my young paladino. Wear it into battle for me.\"\n\nSimon went to her, his steel-shod feet echoing in the hallway. All his\nmovements felt slow and clumsy in the mail shirt that hung to his thighs\nand the mail breeches that protected him from waist to ankle.\n\nEmbossed on the medallion was a mounted knight driving his lance into a\ncoiling bat-winged dragon baring huge fangs in rage. Where the lance\npierced the scales was set a tiny, teardrop-shaped ruby.\n\n\"Thank you, Donna Elvira,\" he breathed, full of admiration for the\nworkmanship. \"It is most beautiful.\"\n\nShe reached up and put it around his neck. He could feel its weight\nthrough his mail shirt.\n\n\"San Giorgio. It was my husband's, and I have kept it locked away in my\njewel casket since the day the puzzolenti Filippeschi murdered him. It\nis yours now. San Giorgio will give you victory.\" She raised her thin\nbody on tiptoe and he felt her dry lips press against his cheek.\n\n\"I will never forget this moment, Madonna.\" He touched her yellow cheeks\nwith his fingertips to brush away her tears.\n\nHe did not want her to know that this was his first--his very\nfirst--battle.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nClimbing the spiral stairs to the tower, his legs ached as he pushed his\nmailed weight upward, and his neck felt strained under his mail hood and\nsteel helmet. It had been weeks since he had worn his mail, days since\nhe had practiced his sword drill. He swore at himself.\n\nHe emerged through a trapdoor onto a square platform paved with\nflagstone. Three helmeted heads turned to him: De Puys, his head covered\nwith tight-laced mail leaving only a circle for his eyes, nose, and\nmustached mouth; Teodoro, capitano of Simon's Venetian crossbowmen,\nwearing a bowl-shaped helmet; and de Verceuil, whose tall helmet was\npainted bright red and shaped like a cardinal's mitre covering his\nentire face with the stem of a gold cross running up the center and the\narms of the cross spread over the eyeholes.\n\nDressed for war, de Verceuil looked more like a cardinal than he usually\ndid, Simon thought ironically.\n\nOf the four men on the tower platform, de Verceuil wore the most\nelaborate armor with steel plates over his mail at his shoulders, knees,\nand shins. Hanging from a broad belt at his side was a mace, an iron\nball on the end of a steel handle a foot long. This was, Simon knew, the\nproper weapon for a clergyman, who was not supposed to shed blood.\n\nOver his mail shirt de Verceuil wore a long crimson surcoat sewn with\ncloth-of-gold Maltese crosses. De Puys, like Simon, wore a purple\nsurcoat on which the three gold crowns of Gobignon were embroidered over\nand over again. Teodoro's simple breastplate of hardened leather was\nreinforced with steel plates.\n\nLeaning into a crenel between two square merlons, Simon took a deep\nbreath of the mild spring air. It would be a pleasant evening, did he\nnot know that many men were going to die.\n\nHe watched the last wagons bringing in casks of water and wine, loads of\nhay and sacks of grain and beans--supplies in case the fighting dragged\non--over the drawbridge through the rear gate. Water, especially, was in\nshort supply in the city on the rock. The palace had its own spring, but\nit did not produce enough water to supply the whole establishment. Simon\nremembered Sophia drinking from his hands in the garden.\n\nHe stopped short at the thought of her to whisper a little prayer for\nher safety. But she was in no danger. No one was threatening Cardinal\nUgolini.\n\nSimon had ordered that every cask of water available in Orvieto be\nbought and every vessel filled. The attackers would surely use fire as a\nweapon. He had also sent for a supply of rocks from a quarry outside\nthe city, extra ammunition for the stone casters mounted on the roof.\n\nHe recalled that Sordello had said the Filippeschi intended a surprise\nattack. They were certain to learn of these preparations and realize\nthat the Monaldeschi had discovered their plan. What if they did not\ncome at all?\n\nIf the fact that the Monaldeschi were ready was enough to prevent the\nattack, that would be the best possible outcome. But Simon realized with\na pang that if the Filippeschi did not come, he would be terribly\ndisappointed.\n\nHe shook his head at his own madness.\n\nSunset reddened the tile roofs surrounding the Monaldeschi palace. From\nup there Simon could see the tall campaniles of Orvieto's five churches\nand the towers of the other palaces--all battlements square, because\nthis was a Guelfo city. A green flag, too small from this distance to\nmake out the device on it, flew over a tower on the southwest side of\nthe city, the palace of the Filippeschi.\n\nHe went to the other side of the tower to look at the city wall. Orange\nand green Monaldeschi banners flew there. He had assigned twenty\nMonaldeschi archers, all he dared subtract from the defenders of the\npalace, to secure the nearest section of the wall. He had wanted to\nstation men in the houses near the palace as well, but de Puys persuaded\nhim that such outposts would surely be overrun and the men speedily\nlost. Better to concentrate his forces in the palace itself.\n\nHe could not make out Cardinal Ugolini's house, somewhere to the\nsoutheast of him. It had no tower to distinguish it. But he thought\nagain of Sophia. How lovely it would be to be with her sitting and\nchatting instead of up in this tower awaiting a deadly onslaught. How\nwonderful if his only worry were whether or not she would accept his\nmarriage proposal.\n\nHe stared out over the city and thought, somewhere out there was another\nenemy. Even if, as Sordello reported, Cardinal Ugolini were not behind\nthis attack, there might be someone behind both the Filippeschi and\nCardinal Ugolini. Ever since he had come to Orvieto, Simon had sensed\nthe presence in this city of a hidden enemy. An enemy who knew him and\nwatched him, but whom he did not know. The one--Simon was sure of\nit--who had killed Alain.\n\n_I am waiting for you_, he said, gripping the red bricks of the\nbattlements.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEvery old soldier Simon had ever talked to had said that war consisted\nmore of waiting than of fighting. Simon found the combination of boredom\nand fear well nigh unbearable.\n\nDe Puys sat with his back against the battlements and dozed like a large\ncat. De Verceuil also sat, his helmet on the tower floor beside him,\nreading from a small leather-bound book, whispering the Latin words.\nSimon supposed it must be his office, the prayers every priest was\nrequired to say every day. The cardinal would have to get today's office\nread quickly; the light was fading fast.\n\nCapitano Teodoro preferred to be busy. He kept shuttling back and forth\nbetween the tower and rooftop two stories below, where his men were\ndeployed. Teodoro would make a circuit of the tower battlements,\nfrowning down at his company of archers. Then he would go down and order\nsix or so men to change position. He would inspect everyone's weapons.\nHe inspected the bows of even the eight Armenians, in their bright red\nsurcoats, who would fight beside the Venetians. The friction between the\nArmenians and the Venetians, Simon had noticed, had lessened\nconsiderably after he promoted Teodoro. He was a good leader. At the\ncontessa's request Teodoro inspected the Monaldeschi men-at-arms, who\nwere mostly stationed at the two gates and in the hallways and apartment\nwindows.\n\nAfter each inspection tour, Teodoro would come back up, study the\nsituation, then go down and rearrange the men, likely as not returning\nthem to their earlier positions.\n\nBut staying busy made sense. It kept everyone alert.\n\nSimon left the tower once to visit his four knights on the rooftop, each\none stationed, with six men-at-arms, by a stone caster at a corner of\nthe roof. So that their missiles would clear the screening he had built\nover the battlements, the long-armed machines were set well back from\nthe edge of the roof. The knights did not like supervising the stone\ncasters. They wanted, they told him, a chance to charge the enemy during\nthe attack. Simon tried to be good-humored about insisting that they\nremain within the palace, but it was hard giving orders to men who were\nolder than himself and combat veterans. He missed Alain, realizing only\nnow how much he had relied on his young friend as a go-between for\nhimself and the other knights.\n\nReturning to the tower roof, Simon kept pacing from one corner to the\nother. He fingered the jeweled hilt of his scimitar. He tried to divert\nhimself by thinking of Sophia, by imagining how he would phrase his\nmarriage proposal to her. He dreaded the fighting, but wished it would\nstart.\n\nLike a rising tide the shadows spread and deepened, swallowing up the\nhills beyond the city, then the city walls, then the towers. The four\nmen stood in darkness, no torchlight up here to make them an easy\ntarget. The only light on the roof below was the shimmer of charcoals\nburning in four braziers for fire arrows.\n\nAn orange glow appeared over the hills to the east, the moon starting to\nrise.\n\nSimon heard distant shouting. Battle cries.\n\n\"Filippeschi!\" It was Teodoro's voice.\n\nSimon saw flickering red light dancing on house walls coming toward\nthem, converging from front, sides, and rear. The streets were too\nnarrow to permit sight of the advancing bravos and their torches.\n\n_So, even though they know we are ready for them, they have come._\n\nFrom the street directly opposite the main entrance to the palace a\nlong, dark shape emerged, like a gigantic tortoise. Similar shapes\nissued from other streets opening on the piazza. The tortoises were big\nenough to shelter at least a dozen men. There were six of them, crawling\nacross the open space.\n\n\"Use the fire arrows!\" Simon shouted. Teodoro repeated the order to his\nmen. On the roof below, men raced from the battlements to the braziers\nand back again, and streaks of light arced from the rooftop at the\ntortoise shapes.\n\nSimon could hear the burning arrows sizzle on the wet wooden frameworks\nand wet hides. The hides did not burn, but the light from the arrows\nmade it easier for the crossbowmen shooting from the battlements to see\ntheir targets. Teodoro was down on the roof directing their fire. The\narchers volleyed at the closest tortoise. The steel bolts tore right\nthrough the skins, piercing the men beneath. Simon heard the thump of\nthirty bolts striking a tortoise at once, then screams. The framework\nstopped moving, and Simon saw men crawling from under it. Some ran\nfrantically back to the shelter of the side streets; others crept a few\npaces and collapsed.\n\nSomething whizzed past Simon's head and struck the brick merlon beside\nhim. A shower of chips clattered on his mail. One stung his cheek.\n\n\"Shooting back,\" said Teodoro. \"From the sides.\"\n\nTorchlight flickered from behind wooden mantlets at the mouths of the\nstreets approaching the palace from the north and south. The rectangles\nof wood filled the street from side to side. From this height Simon\ncould see the crowds of men behind each mantlet.\n\nFire arrows from mantlets and tortoises hissed overhead and fell,\ntrailing sparks, into the atrium of the palace. Simon heard splashes as\nservants threw water on the trees.\n\n\"Put more of your men on the sides,\" he said to Teodoro, who hurried\ndown the stairs inside the tower.\n\nThe moon was now a red oval low in the eastern sky. The light would help\nthe Filippeschi target the defenders on the rooftop, but it would not\nexpose them in the streets.\n\nA loud crash startled Simon, and he felt the tower floor shake. Another\ncrash and another. Stone casters. The stones were coming from all\ndirections, and Simon could hear screams.\n\nHe turned to de Puys. \"Fire our stone casters.\"\n\nWith de Puys gone, only Simon and the cardinal were left in the tower.\nThey had nothing to say to each other. The cardinal had donned his\nmiter-shaped helmet at the first sign of the Filippeschi, and Simon\ncould not see his face. Simon longed for Teodoro to come back.\n\nIt was Simon's equerry, Thierry, who pushed open the trapdoor. \"Capitano\nTeodoro is hit.\"\n\n\"Blood of God!\" Simon pushed past de Puys to hurry down the tower's\ninner staircase.\n\nTeodoro lay near the entrance to the tower, surrounded by a crowd of\nmen-at-arms. His breathing came in hoarse gasps, alternating with grunts\nof pain. It was too dark for Simon to see him well. He knelt beside\nTeodoro, and a vile smell of excrement choked him. Someone beside Simon\nwas sobbing. Teodoro had been much liked among the Venetians.\n\nCarefully Simon felt down the capitano's body. The hard leather cuirass\nhe wore was cracked down the center. Just below his chest Simon's hand\nmet the huge rock. It was wet, probably with Teodoro's blood.\n\n\"It caught him right in the middle,\" said an archer standing over Simon.\n\"Broke him in two. Crushed his belly and his spine. Only the part of him\nabove the stone is alive.\"\n\nA gurgling sound rose in Teodoro's throat. He was vomiting, and warm\nliquid gushed over Simon's hand. His own stomach writhed, and bile\nburned his throat. He stood up suddenly, and instantly regretted it,\nbecause he had wanted to comfort Teodoro in his dying. But the gasping\nhad stopped.\n\nTeodoro had probably never known he was there.\n\nSimon's hands and knees were trembling.\n\n_So this is what it is like to be killed in battle._\n\nHe wiped his hand on his surcoat. Careful to make his voice firm, he\nordered the archers back to their positions. The weight of his mail\nalmost unbearable, he stumbled back to the doorway to the tower.\n\nHe felt his arm gripped and heard Friar Mathieu's voice. \"Simon, I heard\nyou lost your capitano of archers.\"\n\n\"This is much worse than I ever thought it would be, Father,\" he\nwhispered, almost as if confessing.\n\nThe hand on his arm squeezed through his mail. \"Trust yourself, Simon.\nYou will do what you must do.\"\n\nBy the light of a fire arrow burning itself out in the overhead screen,\nSimon saw the contessa, her purple gown tied up to her knees so she\ncould move more quickly. She called Friar Mathieu to see to a wounded\nman, then greeted Simon.\n\n_She thinks I am a hero. If only she knew the horror I feel._\n\nWho was Teodoro's second-in-command? Yes, Peppino. Peppino was the one\nwho had fought with the Armenians at Alain's funeral, but a new capitano\nmust be appointed immediately. There was no time to balance\nconsiderations.\n\nHe managed to find Peppino and appointed him to lead the Venetians. Then\non shaking legs he pushed himself back up to the roof of the tower.\n\n\"They are bombarding the rear gatehouse with mangonels,\" de Puys said.\nSimon heard rocks thudding against the drawbridge at the rear of the\npalace, the entrance for horses and wagons. By moonlight he was able to\nmake out, across the street from the rear of the palace, four mangonels,\nstone guns shaped like giant crossbows.\n\n\"Where did the Filippeschi get so many men and machines?\" Simon wondered\naloud.\n\n\"One would suppose you could answer that,\" said de Verceuil, his voice\nmuffled by his helmet. \"Are you not our military expert?\"\n\nSimon was still too gripped by horror to be angry. But a part of his\nmind somehow kept trying to think about what the Filippeschi intended.\n\nHe became lost in thought as he gnawed at the problem, and all but\nforgot the battle raging around him. Numerous as they seemed, the\nFilippeschi had just a chance, no more than that, of overwhelming the\nMonaldeschi palace, especially having lost the advantage of surprise.\nWas their hatred of the Monaldeschi so deep that such an uncertain\nchance was reason enough for them to make this effort?\n\n_If I could but capture Marco di Filippeschi and force him to tell me\nwhy he is doing this ..._\n\nWhat if this attack were a diversion, a cover for the real blow, to be\nstruck by stealth?\n\nSimon's body went cold.\n\n\"I must see to the Tartar ambassadors,\" he said. He turned toward the\ntrapdoor in the tower roof.\n\n\"Monseigneur--look--the Filippeschi are attacking again,\" de Puys\nprotested. Simon turned back, looked over the edge, and saw the tortoise\nshapes moving forward again over the piazza while stones from mangonels\nslammed into the second-story gatehouse.\n\n_No_, he thought. _Even if they break down the door, they could never\nget up the stairs. This attack is a feint._\n\n\"I believe the ambassadors are in danger,\" he said.\n\n\"By God's robe!\" de Verceuil boomed from under his helmet. \"You are\nquitting the battle?\"\n\n\"The battle is where the ambassadors are,\" Simon said. \"The whole\npurpose of this attack is to get at them.\"\n\n\"The whole purpose of your saying that is to get out of danger,\" de\nVerceuil retorted.\n\nSimon quivered with rage. De Verceuil's eyes glittered coldly at him in\nthe moonlight through holes cut in the blood-red helmet. Simon wished he\ncould draw his sword and swing it at the damned cardinal's head. But he\nfelt as if he were suddenly wrapped in chains. With de Verceuil accusing\nhim of cowardice, how could he leave the tower?\n\nDe Puys put a steadying hand on his arm. \"Monseigneur, no one can get at\nthe ambassadors. Not as long as we hold fast here.\"\n\nIn the florid face with its drooping mustaches Simon saw pity, but also\na trace of contempt. The old warrior, too, thought his young seigneur\nwanted to run away. If Simon left the tower now, he would have to bear\nhis vassal's scorn. Nor was it likely that de Puys would keep silent\nabout this. The tale would spread throughout the Gobignon domain.\n\n_But I know I am not a coward._\n\nSearching his heart, he knew that though he was afraid of the flying\ncrossbow bolts and stones, he could direct the battle from the tower all\nnight if need be. Even after Teodoro's death, and the blood still sticky\non the mailed glove that hung from his right wrist, he felt strong\nenough to go on fighting.\n\nIf he went to the ambassadors and no one struck at them, he would have\nbeen mistaken, but his leaving here would not affect the outcome of the\nbattle. What was happening out here was a simple matter of force against\nforce. If he remained here and the Tartars were attacked and murdered,\nall would be lost.\n\n_If I do not do what I believe I should because I am afraid of what\nthese men think, then truly I am a coward._\n\nHe tried to make the other two understand. \"The safety of the\nambassadors is my first obligation. Enemies could be in the palace now.\"\n\nDe Verceuil brought his steel-masked face close to Simon's. \"It is known\nthat there is tainted blood in your family.\"\n\nSimon's face went as hot as if a torch had suddenly been thrust at him.\nIt was a moment before he could speak.\n\n\"If you were not a man of the Church, I would kill you for saying that.\"\nHis voice trembled.\n\n\"Really? I doubt you would dare.\" De Verceuil turned away.\n\n\"Monseigneur!\" de Puys cried, his face redder than ever. \"Do not make me\nashamed to wear the purple and gold.\"\n\nThat hurt even more than what de Verceuil had said. It hurt so much\nSimon wanted to weep with anger and frustration.\n\nInstead, he bent forward and lifted the trapdoor and hurried down the\nsteps. He heard de Verceuil say something to de Puys, but he could not\nhear what it was. Fortunately.\n\nHe stopped on the roof to look for Friar Mathieu. Groups of crossbowmen\nwere running from one side to the other. Friar Mathieu was making the\nsign of the cross over a fallen man.\n\n\"I think the Tartars may be in danger, Friar Mathieu,\" Simon said. \"I\nwant you to come with me so that I can talk to them.\"\n\nTo Simon's relief the old Franciscan did not object. \"Let us take two of\nthe Armenians with us,\" he said. \"If there is danger, you should not go\nalone.\"\n\nNow that he was away from de Verceuil and de Puys, Simon could reflect\nthat he might, indeed, be mistaken. But he had to act, even though he\ndoubted himself.\n\nSimon, Friar Mathieu, and two Armenian warriors named Stefan and Grigor\nhurried down the tower's inner staircase to the ground floor. Single\ncandles, burning low, lit the corridor at long intervals. Here were\nstorerooms and cubbyholes where servants worked and lived. The\nrelentless pounding of rocks reverberated in the stone walls, punctuated\nby occasional screams penetrating through the arrow slits.\n\nMonaldeschi men-at-arms standing at the embrasures with crossbows kept\ntheir backs turned to Simon as he hurried past. An odor of damp stone\npervaded the still air. Simon noted that as he had ordered, buckets of\nwater had been placed along the corridor to douse fires.\n\nThe kitchen was on the north side of the building. It was dark as a\ncave. The cooking fire in the great fireplace, big enough for a man to\nwalk into it, had been put out. They passed empty cauldrons, piles of\nfull sacks, rows of barrels, all barely visible in the light of a\nhalf-consumed taper in a candlestick on a table. A large water cask\nsurrounded by buckets and pots stood in the center of the kitchen.\n\nAttackers could be hiding here. But Simon knew he did not have enough\nmen to search. He must get to the Tartars and stay with them.\n\nThe pantry where the contessa kept her costly stock of spices imported\nfrom the East was below ground. Stefan lifted a heavy trapdoor, and one\nby one they climbed down a narrow flight of wooden steps without a\nbanister. Grigor, bringing up the rear, held a candle to light their\nway.\n\nA door of rough oaken planks bound together with iron straps stood\nbefore him. He felt his stomach knot as he walked up to it. What if he\nwere too late?\n\nSimon had ordered that the square black iron lock set in the door be\nleft unlocked in the case the Tartars should have to escape. He pulled\non the handle. The door was bolted from the inside, of course, with a\nbolt he had only that afternoon ordered the Monaldeschi carpenter to\ninstall. From the other side a voice asked a half-audible question.\n\n\"It is Count Simon,\" he said. \"Let us in.\" Friar Mathieu added a few\nwords in the Tartar tongue.\n\nThe bolt slid back and the door opened inward. Simon stepped forward to\nsee how his charges had fared.\n\nThe storeroom was dimly lit by a small oil lantern. The two Armenians\nwithin had risen from chairs. They had their bows in their hands,\narrows nocked. They stood in front of the Tartars. John, the\nwhite-haired Tartar, and Philip, the black-haired one, sat on cushions\non the floor, leaning back against the shelves of spice jars that\ncovered three walls of the room. Their bows were on the table and their\ncurving swords, in scabbards, lay in their laps.\n\nSimon was pleased to see that they looked alert. It must be maddening to\nsit down here in semidarkness and do nothing while a battle raged above.\n\nHe reminded himself that if no one attacked the Tartars while the\nFilippeschi besieged the palace, his reputation would be ruined. He felt\na momentary pang of anguish, and found himself actually hoping that the\nenemy would come here. Quickly he stifled the feeling.\n\n_Do not call on the devil. He may hear you and come._\n\n\n\n\nXLIII\n\n\nHidden in the cellar behind a rack of wine barrels, Daoud watched the\nFrankish count, the old priest, and the two Armenians as they paused\nbefore the door of the spice pantry.\n\nHe thought: _Man can plan and plan, but God will surprise and surprise._\n\nHe had been just about to try to trick the Tartars into letting him into\nthe spice pantry when de Gobignon and the others came down the stairs.\nHe suppressed his fury and forced himself to stay calm.\n\nThe spice pantry door opened for de Gobignon and those with him. From\nhis hiding place Daoud caught just a glimpse of the Tartars, both\nsitting with sheathed swords in their laps, their two guards standing in\nfront of them. Their refuge appeared to be lit by a single lantern.\n\nDaoud was perhaps only twelve paces from the doorway, but the cellar was\nmostly in darkness, and he was dressed entirely in black, his head\ncovered with a tight black hood, his face masked. For ease and silence\nof movement he wore no mail. The garb of a fedawi, a Hashishiyya\nfighter.\n\nWith gestures de Gobignon ordered his two Armenians to stand guard\noutside the door. One set a candle in a sconce high in the cellar wall.\nThen they unslung their bows and nocked arrows and stood on either side\nof the door, which closed behind Gobignon and the old priest. Daoud\nheard a bolt slide shut with a clank.\n\nBaffled, he bit his lower lip. What demon had inspired de Gobignon to\ncome down from the battlements and join the Tartars just at this moment?\nNow he could not get to the pantry door without being seen and having to\nfight the two Armenians outside. That would alert those inside, and the\ndoor was bolted from within. He took deep breaths to clear his head of\nfrustration.\n\nHe would have to change his plan of attack.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTo get into the Monaldeschi palace he had used a peasant's cloak and\nhigh boots like those he had worn last summer when he'd landed at\nManfredonia. It had been an easy matter paying a few silver denari to a\nfarmer and then helping with the loading and unloading of sacks of rice\nbeing delivered to the Monaldeschi. Once inside the palace courtyard it\nhad been the work of a moment to slip away from the carts and hide\nhimself in the maze of dark rooms on the ground floor of the palace.\nThere he had shed the peasant costume, leaving his black Hashishiyya\ngarb, and he'd pulled the hood and mask over his head.\n\nBut the very thing that made it easy for him to get into the palace with\nthat cartload of rice left him shocked and uneasy. The Monaldeschi were\npreparing for a siege. He had seen screens against fire arrows being set\nup on the roof and householders in the neighborhood locking their doors\nand fleeing.\n\nSomeone had warned the Monaldeschi. When the Filippeschi came tonight,\ntheir hereditary enemies would be ready for them.\n\nHeart pounding, he pondered. What if the Filippeschi called off the\nattack? He tried to tell himself that it would not matter. Even the\nexpectation of a siege would so distract the Tartars' protectors that he\nwould be able to get at them.\n\nAnd, he promised himself, if he came out alive, he would search out and\nrepay whoever had betrayed him.\n\nHe had rechecked his weapons--the strangling cord, the Scorpion, the\ntiny vessel of Greek fire in its padded pouch, the disk of Hindustan and\na dagger, its blade painted black. After nightfall he would seek out\nthe Tartars' apartment, which he knew was on the third floor of the\npalace, where the best rooms were. In the meantime, he had hidden in a\ncorner of the kitchen behind a large water cask. He had squatted there\nand waited, taut as a bowstring, to find out whether the Filippeschi\nwould attack.\n\nWhen he heard the first battle shouts through the narrow embrasures on\nthe ground floor, he let out a little sigh of relief. Of course Marco di\nFilippeschi would go through with the attack. Even without surprise, he\nwas doubtless better prepared tonight to fight the Monaldeschi than ever\nbefore in his life. And Marco was not the sort of man who, once\ncommitted to a course, would turn back.\n\nEven as these thoughts passed through his mind, Daoud had been surprised\nto see the two Tartars with two of their Armenian guards stride past\nhim.\n\nOf course, he thought, de Gobignon must have realized that the Tartars\nmight be a target, and he was moving them to a safer place.\n\nFor a moment the Tartars had been abreast of him. Two poisoned darts\nfrom the Scorpion would do it.\n\nBut, just then, a dozen or so Monaldeschi archers, crossbows loaded and\ncranked back, had trotted into the kitchen and nearby rooms and taken up\nstations by the embrasures. Daoud, his body aquiver with excitement, the\nlittle crossbow already in his hands, had sunk back into hiding. If he\nshot the Tartars, he might have been able to escape the two Armenians,\nbut so many men-at-arms would certainly kill or, worse, capture him. And\nonce they discovered who he was, Sophia, Ugolini, all those working with\nhim, would swiftly be in the hands of the Franks.\n\nSeething with frustration, he had watched an Armenian open a cellar\ntrapdoor. The two Tartars and the two Armenian guards descended out of\nsight.\n\nDaoud, still crouched behind the water cask, then decided that God had\nbeen kind to him. Even if he had been denied this opportunity to kill\nthem, at least he had seen where the Tartars were.\n\nHe had sat in his hiding place, relaxed but alert, listening to the\nMonaldeschi bowmen shout encouragement to one another as they fired on\nthe Filippeschi trying to cross the piazza. The arrow slits were cut\nthrough the thick walls in angled pairs so that two archers side by side\nwould have a full field of fire. After a while Daoud began to despair of\never getting into the cellar.\n\nSeveral times servants came running to fill buckets from the cask to put\nout fires in the atrium. Crouched in the darkness behind the cask,\nDaoud saw, grouped around it, buckets, pots, and kettles, all sorts of\nvessels, already filled with water for immediate use.\n\nLong after the battle began, a pageboy came running down the stairs to\nthe ground floor with an order for the archers to come up to the roof.\n\nThey left only one man to watch through the arrow slots. His back,\nsheathed in a shiny brown leather cuirass, was turned toward Daoud. The\nnoise of fighting from outside was loud enough, Daoud thought, to mask\nany sound he might make.\n\nHe slipped from behind the cask and picked up a wooden bucket full of\nwater. Carrying the bucket he stepped, silent on his soft-soled boots,\nto the cellar trapdoor. Keeping his eyes on the crossbowman, he put the\nbucket down and, holding his breath, grasped the handle of the trapdoor\nand lifted it. The archer moved as Daoud crouched by the open trapdoor.\nDaoud froze. But the man's back remained turned. He was only shifting\nfrom one arrow slot to the one beside it, to get a view of the piazza\nfrom a different angle.\n\nWhen the archer was settled in his new position, Daoud crept down the\ncellar stairs, bucket in one hand, and lowered the door over his head.\nHe watched the archer until the slab of wood cut off his view. He was in\na pitch-black cellar smelling of wine.\n\nHe saw a crack of light from under a door and heard voices. He was about\nto go and knock, pretending to be a man-at-arms with a message. When the\ntwo Armenians within opened the door, he would douse their lantern with\nthe water he was carrying, and then move in on the Tartars in the dark.\n\nJust then the trapdoor above had opened. He hid behind the wine barrels\nas de Gobignon, the friar, and two more Armenians came down to join\ntheir Tartar charges.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nStones were slamming into the walls in such rapid succession that the\nbuilding was continually shaking. This must be the climax of the\nFilippeschi attack. Next would come a rush of all the fighting men. They\nwould storm the palace and either break through or be driven off.\nProbably, Daoud thought, the attack would fail. But even so, it would\ngive him the opportunity he needed.\n\nThe two Armenian guards held their bows laxly, resting their backs\nagainst the wall by the door. The candle in the sconce was six paces\naway from the guards. Silently he lifted the bucket of water he had\nbrought down with him and moved it out in front of the wine barrel rack\nso that later he could quickly reach it. Then he loaded the Scorpion,\ndrawing back its string.\n\nHe stepped out from behind the barrels, aiming for the eye of the\nnearest guard, and fired. The steel dowels snapped forward, propelling\nthe bolt through the eyeball and into the skull. The man collapsed\nwithout an outcry. His body, clad in leather and steel, hit the stone\nfloor with a crash.\n\nThe other Armenian gave a shrill shout in his native tongue. He stared\nin horror at Daoud, and his heavy compound bow was up, the iron\narrowhead pointing at Daoud's chest.\n\nDaoud had already taken the disk of Hindustan out of the flat pouch on\nthe left side of his belt. Dropping the Scorpion into its pocket, he\ntransferred the disk to his right hand. The disk was heavy; by Frankish\nweight it would probably be half a pound. Its center was of strong,\nflexible steel; bonded to its edges was a more brittle steel that would\ntake an edge sharp enough to slice a hair lengthwise.\n\nDaoud scaled the disk at the candle that rested in the sconce at the\ndoor to the pantry. It sliced through the candle's tip, just below the\nwick. The flame went out, plunging the cellar into total darkness. The\ndisk rang against the stone wall, then clanged to the floor. Daoud's\ntrained hearing registered the place where it fell. The Armenian's bolt\nwhistled past him and hit the wall with a sharp crack.\n\nVoices from inside the spice pantry shouted questions. That must be the\ntwo Armenians who had first gone in there with the Tartars. The man\noutside answered, and Daoud could hear fear in his voice. De Gobignon\nwould not want to open the door to help the Armenian, for fear of\nendangering the Tartars.\n\nSomehow, he had to be made to open the door.\n\nDaoud stood still, listening to the guard's rapid, heavy breathing, the\nscraping of his boot soles on the stone floor.\n\nAfter a moment he tiptoed to the side of the chamber, retrieved his\ndisk, and dropped it into its pouch in his tunic.\n\nSilently picking up the water bucket in front of the wine barrel rack,\nhe drifted closer to the guard, thinking of smoke, as the Hashishiyya\nhad taught him, to make himself move even more quietly.\n\nHe heard the Armenian sling his bow over his shoulder, and the\nslithering of his sword coming out of his scabbard.\n\nDaoud set the water down and crept close to the guard, utterly silent,\nlistening for the many small noises that would tell him where the man\nwas and how he was standing--breathing, swallowing and the licking of\nlips, the creak of leather armor, the rustle of cloth, the clink of\nsteel. Slowly and very carefully Daoud reached out toward the guard's\nthroat, then with a sudden movement seized it, his thumb and fingers\ngripping like a falcon's talons.\n\nHis action had the desired effect. The Armenian screamed, forcing air\nthrough his constricted throat again and again.\n\nHe tried to slash at Daoud's arm but missed.\n\nWith his free hand Daoud grabbed the guard's wrist and gave it a sharp\nturn. He let go of his opponent's throat and used both hands to force\nhis sword arm down. He straightened the arm out and brought his knee\ndown hard on the elbow, throwing all his weight on it.\n\nThe guard screamed with pain, and his sword clattered to the floor.\nDaoud kicked it off into the darkness, then danced away. The Armenian\nfell back against the spice pantry door, groaning in pain and fear.\n\nDaoud heard muffled cries from the other side of the door. They demanded\nto know what was happening. They begged to know what was happening.\n\nThe Armenian's agonized voice cried out to them, also begging, to be let\nin, to be saved from the man who was killing him in the blackness.\n\nDaoud readied himself, finding the water bucket again in the dark and\npicking it up. He held it with both hands, by the handle and by the\nbase. He would have only a little time to use it, before they found some\nway to stop him.\n\nHe heard the men on the other side of the door slide back the iron bolt.\nIt was the only thing they could do, Daoud thought. The other Armenians\ncould not bear to keep the door shut and let their comrade die.\n\nThe wooden door swung inward. Light sprang out into the cellar from only\none oil-fed lantern, but dazzled Daoud because he had been in complete\ndarkness since he put out the candle. He now saw the man he had been\nfighting, a squat man with a thick black mustache, tears of pain running\nfrom his eyes, his right arm dangling limply.\n\nIn the fraction of an instant before his enemies saw him, Daoud took in\neverything in the spice pantry.\n\nDe Gobignon was standing just inside the door, holding his beautiful\nscimitar out before him in his right hand. With his left hand he\nreached for the wounded guard to pull him in. On either side of him were\nthe other two Armenians, bows drawn, ready to fire. Beyond them Daoud\nglimpsed the Tartars, also with bows loaded and pulled, and the old\npriest.\n\nBut the most important thing in there was that small, weak flame\nflickering behind sheets of horn in a box-shaped lantern on the table in\nthe center of the room.\n\nDaoud stepped as close as he dared into the doorway and raised the\nbucket high, heaving the water in a stream at the table.\n\nHe heard a bow thrum and an arrow whistle past his shoulder. His eyes\nmet de Gobignon's just as the light went out.\n\nLike a stone fired from a catapult he hurled himself, crouching low,\ninto the pantry.\n\nLanding silently inside the room, he changed direction once, twice, a\nthird time, ending up at the door. He slammed it shut and bolted it.\nThey should all now be thoroughly confused.\n\nIn total darkness, seeing with his senses of hearing, smell, and touch,\nhe began to stalk the Tartars.\n\n\n\n\nXLIV\n\n\nSimon heard the thick door slam and the iron bolt driven into place. He\nstood in a blackness darker than any night outdoors would have been, his\nscimitar heavy and invisible in his hand. It was all he had against an\nenemy who was also invisible. He felt death rushing upon him out of the\ndarkness.\n\nExcept for the occasional vibrations of a rock hitting the palace wall,\nall sounds of battle were blocked out of the spice pantry. In the deep\nsilence, Simon's heartbeat thundered in his ears like a kettledrum.\n\n_It was my stupidity that opened the door to him._\n\nHe had caught only a glimpse of the enemy. All in black from head to\nfoot, eyes shining through oval holes in his mask. Truly like a devil.\n\nThe stalker had deliberately doused the light, which must mean he could\nfind his victims in the dark.\n\nSimon's body went from hot to cold. While he stood here helplessly, the\nmen with him could be dying. He tried to force himself to think, but his\nmind was motionless as a stone.\n\nAll around Simon was confusion. He heard Grigor, the guard who had\nstaggered into the room just before the light went out, moaning with\npain. He heard men stumbling about. They kept bumping into him. He\nlowered his scimitar to avoid stabbing someone by accident.\n\nA crash made Simon jump. That was the lantern, smashed probably, by the\nman in black, so that no one could relight it.\n\nNext he would start killing them, one by one.\n\n_God, if only I had some light. Just a little._\n\nThe odors of the precious spices the Monaldeschi stored in this pantry\npervaded the air--saffron, cardamom, pepper, cloves, ginger, nutmeg,\ncinnamon. When Simon had first entered the spice pantry a short time ago\nit had seemed a pleasant enough smell. Now it was making him sick.\n\nWas there still a lighted candle in the cellar outside?\n\n\"The door!\" he shouted. \"Get the door open.\" Friar Mathieu repeated his\ncommand in the Armenian tongue.\n\nHe heard a scraping, as of someone pulling on the heavy bolt that held\nthe door shut. Then a thud and a choking cry of pain. Then a sound like\na heavy sack being dropped.\n\nSimon groaned inwardly. He could picture what had happened. Now the door\nwas held shut, not just by a bolt, but by a dead body.\n\nHe felt ice cold, but sweat trickled under his mail. The blackness was\nthick, a blanket, smothering him. The smells of the spices were cloying,\ndizzying. His stomach felt queasy.\n\n\"Flint and tinder!\" Simon shouted, and Friar Mathieu repeated his words\nfor the Armenians and Tartars. Everything he said had to be translated.\nThe delay was maddening.\n\nAnd, Simon realized, anyone who tried to strike a light would make\nhimself the enemy's next target.\n\nGod's blood, even by answering Friar Mathieu the Tartars would give away\ntheir location to the stalker. The man in black must be able to find his\nvictims by listening for them.\n\nSo, if sound would make them visible, then the only way to thwart this\ndemon would be by silence. And even now men were starting to answer\nSimon's call for flint.\n\n\"Silence!\" he shouted. His voice sounded shrill in his ears, like a\nfrightened boy's.\n\nFor a moment there was no sound in the blackness.\n\n\"He finds us by the sounds we make,\" Simon said. \"Everyone remain still,\nand we will hear him when he moves.\"\n\nAs Friar Mathieu translated, Simon realized that either he or Friar\nMathieu could be the next victim. The stalker would want to kill the\nFranciscan so Simon could not communicate with the others.\n\nAnd one Armenian was badly hurt, one was probably dead outside and one\ndead by the door. Left able to fight were only Simon, the Tartars, and\none Armenian guard. They had swords and bows, but the bows would just be\nencumbrances in this total blackness.\n\nIn minutes the ambassadors could be dead. Simon felt terrified, drowning\nin darkness, almost overcome with helplessness.\n\n_I must make him come to me._\n\nThe thought frightened Simon even more. He did not know whether he would\nhave the courage to act on it.\n\nWhat weapons did the stalker have? In the glimpse Simon had of him\nbefore he put the candle out, the man in black had seemed to be\nempty-handed. His weapons must be small ones that could kill, but might\nnot be quite so dangerous to a man in mail.\n\n\"Everyone remain still,\" Simon said loudly. \"You will hear me moving\nsteadily about. If you hear someone else as well, it is the enemy.\"\n\nHe racked his brain to remember the size and shape of the room. Holding\nhis sword low, he put his hand up before his face and forced himself to\ntake one step, then another. An attack might come from any direction.\nThe trembling of his hands and knees made his mail jingle faintly.\n\nThe mailed glove dangling from his wrist rattled as his bare hand\nencountered a man's face. The man gasped and pulled away.\n\n\"C'est moi,\" said Simon, just to let the man hear his voice, knowing it\ndid not matter what language he spoke. He was not afraid of calling\nattention to himself. He wanted the stalker to come for him. And he\nwanted those on his side to know where he was so they would not attack\nhim by mistake.\n\nThe face he felt was hot, sweaty, with a bushy mustache--one of the\nArmenians. The killer had been masked. Simon patted the man on the\nshoulder and moved on. He doubted that he could find the man in black\nthis way. If the stalker were as skilled at moving about in the dark as\nhe seemed to be, he could easily evade Simon.\n\nThe Tartars seemed to have understood the peril they were in; they had\nbeen silent now for a long time.\n\nThe thought struck him like ice between his shoulder blades: What if the\nkiller had already gotten to them, and they were silent because they\nwere dead? He wanted to call out to them, or to Friar Mathieu, to be\nsure they were all right. He suppressed the urge and reached out for\nanother face.\n\nThis time he felt a beard. It was long and full. Friar Mathieu.\n\n\"C'est moi,\" Simon said again, and a hand reached up and squeezed his\nreassuringly.\n\nThe next face was hard, bony. There was a mustache that his fingers\nfollowed long below the mouth. The beard was thin, sprouting from the\nchin only. One of the Tartars. Simon felt the face move under his touch.\nThank God, the man was alive.\n\nHe reached beyond the Tartar and felt a shoulder. This must be the other\nTartar. But no--the shoulder was high, as high as the Tartar's head.\n\nJust as he was about to jump back he felt something brush over his hair.\n\nA cord was around his neck.\n\nIt jerked tight with such force that Simon's breath was instantly cut\noff. Pain circled his neck like a band of fire.\n\nHis scream forced its way through his throat as a drawn-out grunt as the\ncord tightened still more. He could feel the blood in his head pressing\nout against his temples and eyeballs. He felt as if nails were being\ndriven into his head.\n\nHe had his scimitar. He raised it and drove it back over his right\nshoulder. It went through empty air. The killer had felt it coming and\nducked out of the way. But for a moment the cord cutting into Simon's\nthroat let up just a bit.\n\nHe heard voices all around him. The others knew what was happening. They\nstumbled about, but they could not see to reach him. He felt himself\nbeing dragged backward, pulled away from his comrades. The cord was\ndigging into his windpipe harder and harder. In a moment his mind would\ngo black. He would not even know when he died. He fought his terror,\nknowing that if he yielded to it, he would surely die.\n\nHe _would_ live. He _would_ see Sophia again.\n\nHe tried to lean forward, to bend his knees, to find some purchase on\nthe stone for his iron-shod feet. Still, the attacker pulled him. Simon\nfelt he had only a child's strength compared to the man in black.\n\nDizzily Simon remembered tug-of-war games when he had been a page at the\nroyal palace.\n\n_When one side lets go, everyone on the other side falls down._\n\nWith his last bit of consciousness, Simon squeezed his whole body into a\ncrouch, then sprang up and backward, like a bow released.\n\nHis mail-clad weight and the attacker's momentum threw them both\nbackward. They crashed together against shelving, and Simon heard\nporcelain shatter. Clouds of ground spices enveloped them, and they fell\nsideways to the floor, Simon on top of his attacker.\n\nHe heard a gasp as the man's breath was knocked out of him. And now _he_\ncould breathe. He choked on air saturated with cinnamon and curry, but\nthe cord was loose.\n\nThe fall had knocked his scimitar out of his hand. Anguished, he felt\nfor it, but it was as if it had fallen into a well.\n\n\"Simon! Where are you?\" Friar Mathieu shouted.\n\n\"Ah! Ah!\" Simon let his breath out and sucked it in, gasping. He wanted\nto cry for help, but he could not use his voice. His body shook with\nterror.\n\nAnd he felt the body under him moving with swift and terrible power. The\ncord snapped tight again.\n\nBut not before Simon got his right hand under it. The killer gave a\nvicious jerk on the thin cord, and it felt as if it might slice through\nhis fingers. But Simon pushed against it with all the strength in his\nright arm, and loosened the cord enough to be able to pull air into his\nthroat. He worked his other hand under it.\n\nHis shout burst from his throat. \"M'aidez! Help me! Here! Here!\"\n\nBoots pounded toward him. He felt men around him. He heard them coughing\nand sneezing from the spices that filled the air. A sword poked him\nthrough his mail.\n\n\"Under me! Stab! Stab! You cannot hurt me!\"\n\nThe cord went lax. The attacker had let go of it. Simon drew air\nfrantically through his tortured windpipe.\n\nBefore he could get to his feet, an arm, hard as if clad in mail,\nwhipped around his neck, clamping him to his enemy. He felt the edge of\na dagger at his throat.\n\nSimon could hear the devil's breathing right by his ear. Frantic, he\njerked his head forward and drove it back, ramming the back of his head\ninto his attacker's face, slamming the enemy's head against the stone\nfloor. Simon felt stunned, but the other must have been stunned, too. He\nheard a whispered gasp.\n\n_How can the devil be so silent?_\n\nHe heard men speaking above him and feet shuffling around him, but\ndespite his command, no swords were jabbing downward. They were afraid\nof stabbing him, even though he was wearing mail.\n\nHe arched his body and brought all his mailed weight down hard. He felt\nthe edge of the enemy's dagger scrape across the chain around his neck.\nA bolt of terror shot through him. If not for that medallion, he would\nbe bleeding to death right now. Simon thrust his steel-encased elbows\ninto his enemy's ribs. The gasp was louder this time, and with a violent\nheave he freed himself.\n\nHe twisted over, arms reaching to wrap around his enemy.\n\n_I have to pin him down. I cannot let him get loose in this room again._\n\nBut the knees below him drew up and the feet kicked against him,\nthrowing him back.\n\n\"Right in front of me!\" Simon cried. \"Get him!\" And then he realized\ndespairingly that none of the armed men on his side could understand\nhim.\n\nAnd no one, it seemed, had flint and steel to strike a light. He knew he\nwas carrying none. Such a simple thing, yet tonight its lack might be\nhis death.\n\nHis foot kicked something that rang against the stone floor. His sword.\nHe swooped down on it, seized it, and thrust blindly straight ahead. The\npoint struck a stone wall, and he felt the blade bend. He checked his\nthrust just in time to keep the scimitar from breaking.\n\nHe heard a movement to his left and stabbed again. Again he struck blank\nstone.\n\n_The devil is somewhere in this part of the room._\n\n\"The door!\" Simon shouted. \"Mathieu, get the door open.\"\n\nHe heard the iron bolt shoved back, the creak of hinges, the scrape of a\nbody being pushed aside.\n\nBut the blackness remained absolute.\n\n_He must have put out the candle in the cellar before he broke in here._\n\nSimon heard running footsteps outside the spice pantry. Sandals slapping\nup wooden stairs. The creaking of the trapdoor at the top of the cellar\nsteps. And then there was light. Gray, faint, but after what seemed like\nhours spent in utter darkness, it was as if the sun had suddenly risen.\n\n_God bless you, Mathieu._\n\nScimitar at the ready, Simon swept the room with his gaze.\n\nA shadowy figure stood halfway along one of the side walls, holding\nsomething out before him in both hands. A miniature crossbow, a\nvicious-looking thing. Simon turned to see where it was pointed.\n\nHe saw John Chagan on the other side of the pantry facing the killer.\n\nHe heard a snap.\n\nBut Grigor, the Armenian who had been hurt outside the spice pantry, had\nstepped between John and the crossbow, and he took the bolt in his\nleather cuirass. Simon felt his mind moving much more slowly than things\nwere happening, trying to grasp it all.\n\nGrigor's eyes opened wide. Perhaps, Simon thought, he had expected that\na bolt from such a little bow would merely bounce off his hardened\nleather armor. Or perhaps he knew that it would kill him.\n\nIn the semidarkness Simon could not see the hole in the cuirass, but\nGrigor's hand went to his chest, and then he toppled over.\n\nThe Tartar Philip had picked up a bow from the floor, and so had the\nother Armenian. Both raised their weapons toward the man in black.\n\n_Now we have him cornered and in a moment I will rip off his mask and\nknow who he is._\n\nThe stalker's black-gloved hand flashed upward and he threw a tiny,\nround object into the pile of broken wooden shelves on the floor. A roar\ndeafened Simon, and a blaze of white flame blinded him. The wooden\nshelves were afire, the flames feeding on the powdered spices that\nfloated in the air. Heat seared Simon's face.\n\n_Death of God! He truly is a devil!_\n\nBy the time Simon and the others had recovered from the burst of fire,\nthe enemy was out the door and running for the cellar stairs. Simon\ncried out wordlessly in frustrated rage. He must not get away, not after\nall he had done to them.\n\nAs the man in black reached the foot of the stairs, Philip stepped into\nthe doorway, drew his bow as calmly and carefully as if he were hunting,\nand loosed an arrow. The man in black jerked to a stop. Simon could see\nthe shaft of the arrow protruding from his right thigh.\n\nThe man reached down and with a sudden movement snapped away the arrow\nshaft. He drew a dagger with a strange blade that did not gleam; it was\ndead black. He raced on up the stairs, limping, but with inhuman\nstrength and speed. Two more arrows flew at him, but missed, clattering\nagainst the cellar walls.\n\nFriar Mathieu stood at the top of the stairs. He held his arms out, a\nlit white candle in one hand, blocking the stalker's path. The man came\nat him with the dagger.\n\n\"No!\" Simon screamed.\n\nWith a sweep of his arm the man in black threw Friar Mathieu down from\nthe banisterless stairs. The old priest fell six feet to the cellar\nfloor, struck with a loud, sickening thump, and lay there, still.\n\nAnd the enemy was gone.\n\nBy the time Simon and the others had climbed up to the kitchen, the man\nin black had vanished into the maze of dark rooms on the first floor of\nthe palace.\n\nSimon, wild with rage and grief, forced himself to think. He was alive,\nGod be thanked, and he had saved the Tartars, but just for this moment.\nThe man in black, seemingly routed, might renew his attack at any time.\n\n_And Friar Mathieu. Dear God, don't let him be dead!_\n\nWhat was the creature Simon had fought in the darkness? Christian?\nSaracen? Or, as his most frightening imaginings hinted, a being from\nhell itself?\n\nClearly it was not some Filippeschi bravo who had somehow broken through\nthe palace's defenses. Simon's inspiration on the battlements had been\nright; the Filippeschi attack had been only a diversion.\n\nIf a demon of this sort opposed the alliance, Simon felt more than ever\ndetermined that the alliance must succeed. This was the hidden enemy\nwhose presence he had sensed since coming to Orvieto. The force\ndetermined to prevent the alliance of Christians and Tartars. The one\nwho had incited Orvieto's people against the Tartars when they first\ncame. Who had set that poor devil of a heretic to draw his dagger\nagainst them in the cathedral. Alain's murderer. Stalker. Enemy. Killer.\nDevil.\n\nHatred blazed up within Simon.\n\nIf only he could have killed the man in black or caught him before he\nescaped. Now he must guard against an enemy as evil as Satan. An enemy\npowerful enough to throw an army against a fortified palace, subtle\nenough to reach into an impregnable chamber and strike at his intended\nvictims. A being whose strength and skills made him seem more than\nhuman. Cruel and pitiless, ready to murder anyone who stood in his way.\n\nIt was as certain as the judgment of God that they would fight again.\nThis was war to the death.\n\n\n   To be concluded in\n      THE HOLY WAR\n Book Two of THE SARACEN\n\n\n\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\n\nRobert Shea has given his full time to writing novels since 1977. He is\nthe co-author of the science-fiction novel ILLUMINATUS!, which won the\nHall of Fame Award of the Libertarian Futurist Society and was produced\nas a play in the United States and in Europe. His historical novels are\nSHIKE, set in medieval Japan, and ALL THINGS ARE LIGHTS, which, like THE\nSARACEN, takes place in the era of the Crusades. He was a magazine\neditor for twenty years and is also a prolific magazine writer. He lives\nwith his wife and son near Chicago.\n\n\n\n\n                IN THE SWEEPING FIRES OF THE\n                         THIRTEENTH CENTURY,\n                            A BOLD NEW WORLD\n                               IS FORGED....\n\n   Into the furious whirlwind of war set off\n       by the bloody Crusades, one man dares\n          to step. His legacy belongs to the\n      Mamelukes, legendary warrior-slaves of\n Egypt. His arsenal consists of no more than\n a sword and a bag of jewels. His mission is\n  to enter Europe's powerful and treacherous\n        realms of king and pope, conspirator\n       and courtesan--and to single-handedly\n             turn the tide of battle between\n                    continent and continent.\n\n      The man is the one they call the White\n    Emir, the blond assassin and spy skilled\n            in combat and sorcery, who moves\n     adeptly and lethally through the worlds\n          of both East and West. Against him\n          stands Simon de Gobignon, a proud,\n   young nobleman from one of the great--and\n            accursed--houses of France. Each\n    fights gallantly and desperately for the\n civilization he serves--and for the love of\n        the ravishing Sophia, whose powerful\n     erotic allure no other mortal woman can\n       surpass, and no man alive can resist.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Saracen: Land of the Infidel, by Robert Shea\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE SARACEN: LAND OF THE INFIDEL ***\n\n***** This file should be named 28515-8.txt or 28515-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/8/5/1/28515/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Stephen Blundell and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will be\nrenamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no one\nowns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (and\nyou!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission\nand without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\n\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\ndownload by the etext year.\n\nhttp://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06\n\n    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\n\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\n\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234\n\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689\n\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/GUTINDEX.ALL\n\n*** END: FULL LICENSE ***\n"}
