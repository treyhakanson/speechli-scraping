GUNN\n\nIllustrated by Ebel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration: Frontispiece: spaceman studying a chess board.]\n\n[Illustration: Spider and rat in outer space surrounded by planets.]\n\n\n\nThe ship was proof against any test, but the men inside her could be\nstrained and warped, individually and horribly. Unfortunately, while the\nmen knew that, they couldn't really believe it. The Aliens could--and\ndid.\n\n    _They sent the advance unit out to scout the new planet in the\n    _Ambassador_, homing down on the secret beeping of a featureless\n    box dropped by an earlier survey party. Then they sat back at\n    GHQ and began the same old pattern of worry that followed every\n    advance unit._\n\n    _Not about the ship. The _Ambassador_ was a perfect machine,\n    automatic, self-adjusting, self-regulating. It was built to last\n    and do its job without failure under any and all conditions, as\n    long as there was a universe around it. And it could not fail.\n    There was no question about that._\n\n    _But an advance unit is composed of men. The factors of safety\n    are indeterminable; the duplications of their internal\n    mechanisms are conjectural, variable. The strength of the unit\n    is the sum of the strengths of its members. The weakness of the\n    unit can be a single small failing in a single man._\n\n\n_Beep ... boop ..._\n\n\"Gotcha!\" said Ives. Ives was Communications. He had quick eyes, quick\nhands. He was huge, almost gross, but graceful. \"On the nose,\" he\ngrinned, and turned up the volume.\n\n_Beep ... boop ..._\n\n\"What else do you expect?\" said Johnny. Johnny was the pilot--young,\nwide, flat. His movements were as controlled and decisive as those of\nthe ship itself, in which he had an unshakeable faith. He slid into the\nbucket seat before the great master console.\n\n_Beep ... boop ..._\n\n\"We expect the ship to do her job,\" said Hoskins, the Engineer. He was\nmild and deft, middle-aged, with a domed head and wide, light-blue eyes\nbehind old fashioned spectacles. He shared Johnny's belief in the\nmachine, but through understanding rather than through admiration. \"But\nit's always good to see her do it.\"\n\n_Beep ... boop ..._\n\n\"Beautiful,\" said Captain Anderson softly, and he may have been talking\nabout the way the ship was homing in on the tiny, featureless box that\nSurvey had dropped on the unexplored planet, or about the planet itself,\nor even about the smooth integration of his crew.\n\n_Beep ... boop ..._\n\nParesi said nothing. He had eyebrows and nostrils as sensitive as a\nradarscope, and masked eyes of a luminous black. Faces and motives were\nto him what gauges and log-entries were to the Engineer. Paresi was the\nDoctor, and he had many a salve and many a splint for invisible ills. He\nsaw everything and understood much. He leaned against the bulkhead, his\ngaze flicking from one to the other of the crew. Occasionally his small\nmustache twitched like the antennae of a cat watching a bird.\n\nBarely audible, faint as the blue outline of a distant hill, hungry and\nlost as the half-heard cry of a banshee, came the thin sound of high\natmosphere against the ship's hull.\n\nAn hour passed.\n\n\n_Bup-bup-bup-bup ..._\n\n\"Shut that damned thing off!\"\n\nIves looked up at the pilot, startled. He turned the gain down to a\nwhisper. Paresi left the bulkhead and stood behind Johnny. \"What's the\nmatter?\" he asked. His voice was feline, too--a sort of purr.\n\nJohnny looked up at him quickly, and grinned. \"I can put her down,\" he\nsaid. \"That's what I'm here for. I--like to think maybe I'll get to do\nit, that's all. I can't think that with the autopilot blasting out an\n'on course'.\" He punched the veering-jet controls. It served men\nperfectly. The ship ignored him, homed on the beam. The ship computed\nvelocity, altitude, gravity, magnetic polarization, windage; used and\nbalanced and adjusted for them all. It adjusted for interference from\nthe manual controls. It served men perfectly. It ignored them utterly.\n\nJohnny turned to look out and downward. Paresi's gaze followed. It was a\nbeautiful planet, perhaps a shade greener than the blue-green of earth.\nIt seemed, indefinably, more park-like than wild. It had an air of\ncontrolled lushness and peace.\n\nThe braking jets thundered as Johnny depressed a control. Paresi nodded\nslightly as he saw the pilot's hand move, for he knew that the autopilot\nhad done it, and that Johnny's movement was one of trained reflex. The\nyoungster was intense and alert, hair-trigger schooled, taught to\npretend in such detail that the pretense was reality to him; a precise\npretense that would become reality for all of them if the machine\nfailed.\n\nBut of course the machine would not fail.\n\nFields fled beneath them, looking like a crazy-quilt in pastel. On them,\nnothing moved. Hoskins moved to the viewport and watched them mildly.\n\"Very pastoral,\" he said. \"Pretty.\"\n\n\"They haven't gotten very far,\" said Ives.\n\n\"Or they've gotten very far indeed,\" said Captain Anderson.\n\nJohnny snorted. \"No factories. No bridges. Cow-tracks and goat paths.\"\n\nThe Captain chuckled. \"Some cultures go through an agrarian stage to\nreach a technological civilization, and some pass through technology to\nreach the pastoral.\"\n\n\"I don't see it,\" said Johnny shortly, eyes ahead.\n\nParesi's hand touched the Captain's arm, and the Captain then said\nnothing.\n\n\n_Pwing-g-g!_\n\n\"Stand by for landing,\" said the Captain.\n\nIves and Hoskins went aft to the shock-panels in the after bulkhead.\nParesi and the Captain stepped into niches flanking the console. Johnny\ntouched a control that freed his chair in its hydraulic gimbals. Chair\nand niches and shock-panels would not be needed as long as the\nartificial gravity and inertialess field functioned; it was a ritual.\n\nThe ship skimmed treetops, heading phlegmatically for a rocky bluff. A\ngush of flame from its underjets and it shouldered heavily upward, just\nmissing the jagged crest. A gout of fire forward, another, and it went\ninto a long flat glide, following the fall of a foothill to the plain\nbeyond. It held course and reduced speed, letting the ground billow up\nto it rather than descending. There was a moment of almost-flight,\nalmost-sliding, and then a rush of dust and smoke which over-took and\npassed them. When it cleared, they were part of the plain, part of the\nplanet.\n\n\"A good landing, John,\" Paresi said. Hoskins caught his eye and frowned.\nParesi grinned broadly, and the exchange between them was clear: _Why do\nyou needle the kid?_ and _Quiet, Engine-room. I know what I'm doing._\nHoskins shrugged, and, with Ives, crossed to the communications desk.\n\nIves ran his fat, skilled hands over the controls and peered at his\nindicators. \"It's more than a good landing,\" he grunted. \"That\nsqueak-box we homed in on can't be more than a hundred meters from here.\nFirst time I've ever seen a ship bullseye like that.\"\n\nJohnny locked his gimbals, ran a steady, sensitive hand over the turn of\nthe console as if it were a woman's flank. \"Why--how close do you\nusually come?\"\n\n\"Planetfall's close enough to satisfy Survey,\" said the Captain. \"Once\nin a while the box will materialize conveniently on a continent. But\nthis--this is too good to be true. We practically landed on it.\"\n\nHoskins nodded. \"It's usually buried in some jungle, or at the bottom of\na sea. But this is really all right. What a lineup! Point nine-eight\nearth gravity, Earth-type atmosphere--\"\n\n\"Argon-rich,\" said, Ives, from the panel. \"Very rich.\"\n\n\"That'll make no real difference,\" Hoskins went on. \"Temperature, about\nnormal for an early summer back home ... looks as if there's a fiendish\nplot afoot here to make things easy for us.\"\n\nParesi said, as if to himself, \"I worry about easy things.\"\n\n\n\"Yeah, I know,\" snorted Johnny, rising to stretch. \"The head-shrinker\nalways does it the hard way. You can't just dislike rice pudding; it has\nto be a sister-syndrome. If the shortest distance is from here to there,\ndon't take it--remember your Uncle Oedipus.\"\n\nCaptain Anderson chuckled. \"Cut your jets, Johnny. Maybe Paresi's\ntortuous reasoning does seem out of order on such a nice day. But\nremember--eternal vigilance isn't just the price of liberty, as the old\nbooks say. It's the price of existence. We know we're here--but we don't\nknow where 'here' is, and won't until after we get back. This is\n_really_ Terra Incognita. The location of Earth, or even of our part of\nthe galaxy, is something that has to be concealed at all costs, until\nwe're sure we're not going to turn up a potentially dangerous, possibly\nsuperior alien culture. What we don't know can't hurt Earth. No\nconceivable method could get that information out of us, any more than\nit could be had from the squeak-box that Survey dropped here.\n\n\"Base all your thinking on that, Johnny. If that seems like leaning over\nbackwards, it's only a sample of how careful we've got to be, how many\nangles we've got to figure.\"\n\n\"Hell,\" said the pilot. \"I know all that. I was just ribbing the\nbat-snatcher here.\" He thumbed a cigarette out of his tunic, touched his\nlighter to it. He frowned, stared at the lighter, tried it again. \"It\ndoesn't work. _Damn_ it!\" he barked explosively, \"I don't like things\nthat don't work!\"\n\nParesi was beside him, catlike, watchful. \"Here's a light. Take it easy,\nJohnny! A bum lighter's not that important.\"\n\nJohnny looked sullenly at his lighter. \"It doesn't work,\" he muttered.\n\"Guaranteed, too. When we get back I'm going to feed it to Supply.\" He\nmade a vivid gesture to describe the feeding technique, and jammed the\nlighter back into his pocket.\n\n\"Heh!\" Ives' heavy voice came from the communications desk. \"Maybe the\nnatives are primitives, at that. Not a whisper of any radio on any band.\nNo powerline fields, either. These are plowboys, for sure.\"\n\nJohnny looked out at the sleeping valley. His irritation over the\nlighter was still in his voice. \"Imagine that. No video or trideo. No\njet-races or feelies. What do people do with their time in a place like\nthis?\"\n\n\"Books,\" said Hoskins, almost absently. \"Chess. Conversation.\"\n\n\"I don't know what chess is, and conversation's great if you want to\ntell somebody something, like 'bring me a steak',\" said Johnny. \"Let's\nget out of this fire-trap,\" he said to the Captain.\n\n\"In time,\" said the Captain. \"Ives, DX those radio frequencies.\nIf there's so much as a smell of radiation even from the other\nside of this planet, we want to know about it. Hoskins, check the\nlanding-suits--food, water, oxygen, radio, everything. Earth-type planet\nor no, we're not fooling with alien viruses. Johnny, I want you to\nsurvey this valley in every way you can and plot a minimum of three\ntake-off vectors.\"\n\n\nThe crew fell to work, Ives and Hoskins intently, Johnny off-handedly,\nas if he were playing out a ritual with some children. Paresi bent over\na stereomicroscope, manipulating controls which brought in samples of\nair-borne bacteria and fungi and placed them under its objective.\nCaptain Anderson ranged up beside him.\n\n\"We could walk out of the ship as if we were on Muroc Port,\" said\nParesi. \"These couldn't be more like Earth organisms if they'd been\ntransplanted from home to delude us.\"\n\nThe Captain laughed. \"Sometimes I tend to agree with Johnny. I never met\na more suspicious character. How'd you ever bring yourself to sign your\ncontract?\"\n\n\"Turned my back on a couple of clauses,\" said Paresi. \"Here--have a\nlook.\"\n\nAt that moment the usually imperturbable Ives uttered a sharp grunt that\nechoed and re-echoed through the cabin. Paresi and the Captain turned.\nHoskins was just coming out of the after alleyway with an oxygen bottle\nin his hand, and had frozen in his tracks at the sharp sound Ives had\nmade. Johnny had whipped around as if the grunt had been a lion's roar.\nHis back was to the bulkhead, his lean, long frame tensed for fight or\nflight. It was indescribable, Ives' grunt, and it was the only sound\nwhich could have had such an effect on such a variety of men--the same\nshocked immobility.\n\nIves sat over his Communications desk as if hypnotized by it. He moved\none great arm forward, almost reluctantly, and turned a knob.\n\nA soft, smooth hum filled the room. \"Carrier,\" said Ives.\n\nThen the words came. They were English words, faultlessly spoken, loud\nand clear and precise. They were harmless words, pleasant words even.\n\nThey were: \"_Men of Earth! Welcome to our planet._\"\n\nThe voice hung in the air. The words stuck in the silence like insects\nwriggling upon a pin. Then the voice was gone, and the silence was\ncomplete and heavy. The carrier hum ceased. With a spine-tingling brief\nblaze of high-frequency sound, Hoskins' oxygen-bottle hit the steel\ndeck.\n\n\nThen they all began to breathe again.\n\n\"There's your farmers, Johnny,\" said Paresi.\n\n\"Knight to bishop's third,\" said Hoskins softly.\n\n\"What's that?\" demanded Johnny.\n\n\"Chess again,\" said the Captain appreciatively. \"An opening gambit.\"\n\nJohnny put a cigarette to his lips, tried his lighter. \"Damn. Gimme a\nlight, Ives.\"\n\nIves complied, saying over his big shoulder to the Captain, \"In case you\nwondered, there was no fix on that. My direction-finders indicate that\nthe signal came simultaneously from forty-odd transmitters placed in a\ncircle around the ship which is their way of saying 'I dunno'.\"\n\nThe Captain walked to the view bubble in front of the console and peered\naround. He saw the valley, the warm light of mid-afternoon, the\ntoo-green slopes and the blue-green distances. Trees, rocks, a balancing\nbird.\n\n\"It doesn't work,\" muttered Johnny.\n\nThe Captain ignored him. \"'_Men of Earth...._'\" he quoted. \"Ives,\nthey've gotten into Survey's squeak-box and analyzed its origin. They\nknow all about us!\"\n\n\"They don't because they can't,\" said Ives flatly. \"Survey traverses\nthose boxes through second-order space. They materialize near a planet\nand drop in. No computation on earth or off it could trace their\nnormal-space trajectory, let alone what happens in the second-order\ncondition. The elements the box is made of are carefully averaged\nisotopic forms that could have come from any of nine galaxies we know\nabout and probably more. And all it does is throw out a VUHF signal that\nsays _beep_ on one side, _boop_ on the other, and _bup-bup_ in between.\nIt does _not_ speak English, mention the planet Earth, announce anyone's\narrival and purpose, or teach etiquette.\"\n\nCaptain Anderson spread his hands. \"They got it from somewhere. They\ndidn't get it from us. This ship and the box are the only Terran\nobjects on this planet. Therefore they got their information from the\nbox.\"\n\n\"Q.E.D. You reason like Euclid,\" said Paresi admiringly. \"But don't\nforget that geometry is an artificial school, based on arbitrary axioms.\nIt just doesn't work where the shortest distance is _not_ a straight\nline.... I'd suggest we gather evidence and postpone our conclusions.\"\n\n\"How do you think they got it?\" Ives challenged.\n\n\"I think we can operate from the fact they got it, and make our analyses\nwhen we have more data.\"\n\n\nIves went back to his desk and threw a switch.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" asked the Captain.\n\n\"Don't you think they ought to be answered?\"\n\n\"Turn it off, Ives.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Turn it off!\" Ives did. An expedition is an informal, highly democratic\ngroup, and can afford to be, for when the situation calls for it, there\nis never any question of where authority lies. The Captain said, \"There\nis nothing we can say to them which won't yield them more information.\nNothing. For all we know it may be very important to them to learn\nwhether or not we received their message. Our countermove is obviously\nto make no move at all.\"\n\n\"You mean just sit here and wait until they do something else?\" asked\nJohnny, appalled.\n\nThe Captain thumped his shoulder. \"Don't worry. We'll do something in\nsome other area than communications. Hoskins--are those landing suits\nready?\"\n\n\"All but,\" rapped Hoskins. He scooped up the oxygen bottle and\ndisappeared.\n\nParesi said, \"We'll tell them something if we _don't_ answer.\"\n\nThe Captain set his jaw. \"We do what we can, Nick. We do the best we\ncan. Got any better ideas?\"\n\nParesi shrugged easily and smiled. \"Just knocking, skipper. Knock\neverything. Then what's hollow, you know about.\"\n\n\"I should know better than to jump salty with you,\" said the Captain,\nall but returning the doctor's smile. \"Johnny. Hoskins. Prepare for\nexploratory patrol.\"\n\n\"I'll go,\" said Paresi.\n\n\"Johnny goes,\" said the Captain bluntly, \"because it's his first trip,\nand because if he isn't given something to do he'll bust his adrenals.\nHoskins goes, because of all of us, the Engineer is most expendable.\nIves stays because we need hair-trigger communications. I stay to\ncorrelate what goes on outside with what goes on inside. You stay\nbecause if anything goes wrong I'd rather have you fixing the men up\nthan find myself trying to fix you up.\" He squinted at Paresi. \"Does\nthat knock solid?\"\n\n\"Solid.\"\n\n\"Testing, Johnny,\" Ives said into a microphone. Johnny's duplicated\nvoice, from the open face-plate of his helmet and from the intercom\nspeaker, said, \"I hear you fine.\"\n\n\"Testing, Hoskins.\"\n\n\"If I'd never seen you,\" said the speaker softly, \"I'd think you were\nright here in the suit with me.\" Hoskins' helmet was obviously buttoned\nup.\n\nThe two men came shuffling into the cabin, looking like gleaming ghosts\nin their chameleon-suits, which repeated the color of the walls.\n\"Someday,\" growled Johnny, \"there'll be a type suit where you can\nscratch your--\"\n\n\n\"Scratch when you get back,\" said the Captain. \"Now hear this. Johnny,\nyou can move fastest. You go out first. Wait in the airlock for thirty\nseconds after the outer port opens. When Ives gives you the beep, jump\nout, run around the bows and plant your back against the hull directly\nopposite the port. Hold your blaster at the ready, aimed down--you hear\nme? _Down_, so that any observer will know you're armed but not\nattacking. Hoskins, you'll be in the lock with the outer port open by\nthat time. When Johnny gives the all clear, you'll jump out and put your\nback against the hull by the port. Then you'll both stay where you are\nuntil you get further orders. Is that clear?\"\n\n\"Aye.\"\n\n\"Yup.\"\n\n\"You're covered adequately from the ship. Don't fire without orders.\nThere's nothing you can get with a blaster that we can't get first with\na projector--unless it happens to be within ten meters of the hull and\nwe can't depress to it. Even then, describe it first and await orders to\nfire except in really extreme emergency. A single shot at the wrong time\ncould set us back a thousand years with this planet. Remember that this\nship isn't called _Killer_ or _Warrior_ or even _Hero_. It's the Earth\nShip _Ambassador_. Go to it, and good luck.\"\n\nHoskins stepped back and waved Johnny past him. \"After you, Jets.\"\n\nJohnny's teeth flashed behind the face-plate. He clicked his heels and\nbowed stiffly from the waist, in a fine burlesque of an ancient\ncourtier. He stalked past Hoskins and punched the button which\ncontrolled the airlock.\n\nThey waited. Nothing.\n\nJohnny frowned, jabbed the button again. And again. The Captain started\nto speak, then fell watchfully silent. Johnny reached toward the button,\ntouched it, then struck it savagely. He stepped back then, one foot\nstriking the other like that of a clumsy child. He turned partially to\nthe others. In his voice, as it came from the speaker across the room,\nwas a deep amazement that rang like the opening chords of a prophetic\nand gloomy symphony.\n\nHe said, \"The port won't open.\"\n\n\n\n\n                     II\n\n    _The extremes of mysticism and of pragmatism have their own\n    expressions of worship. Each has its form, and the difference\n    between them is the difference between_ deus ex machina _and_\n    deus machina est.\n        --_E. Hunter Waldo_\n\n\n\"Of course it will open,\" said Hoskins. He strode past the stunned pilot\nand confidently palmed the control.\n\nThe port didn't open.\n\nHoskins said, \"Hm?\" as if he had been asked an inaudible question, and\ntried again. Nothing happened. \"Skipper,\" he said over his shoulder,\n\"Have a quick look at the meters behind you there. Are we getting\nauxiliary power?\"\n\n\"All well here,\" said Anderson after a glance at the board. \"And no\nshorts showing.\"\n\nThere was a silence punctuated by the soft, useless clicking of the\ncontrol as Hoskins manipulated it. \"Well, what do you know.\"\n\n\"It won't work,\" said Johnny plaintively.\n\n\"Sure it'll work,\" said Paresi swiftly, confidently. \"Take it easy,\nJohnny.\"\n\n\"It won't work,\" said Johnny. \"It won't work.\" He stumbled across the\ncabin and leaned against the opposite bulkhead, staring at the closed\nport with his head a little to one side as if he expected it to shriek\nat him.\n\n\"Let me try,\" said Ives, going to Hoskins. He put out his hand.\n\n\"_Don't!_\" Johnny cried.\n\n\"Shut up, Johnny,\" said Paresi.\n\n\"All right, Nick,\" said Johnny. He opened his face plate, went to the\nrear bulkhead, keyed open an acceleration couch, and lay face down on\nit. Paresi watched him, his lips pursed.\n\n\"Can't say I blame him,\" said the Captain softly, catching Paresi's eye.\n\"It's something of a shock. This shouldn't _be_. The safety factor's too\ngreat--a thousand per cent or better.\"\n\n\"I know what you mean,\" said Hoskins. \"I saw it myself, but I don't\nbelieve it.\" He pushed the button again.\n\n\"I believe it,\" said Paresi.\n\nIves went to his desk, clicked the transmitter and receiver switches on\nand off, moved a rheostat or two. He reached up to a wall toggle, turned\na small air-circulating fan on and off. \"Everything else seems to work,\"\nhe said absently.\n\n\"This is ridiculous!\" exploded the Captain. \"It's like having your keys\nhome, or arriving at the theater without your tickets. It isn't\ndangerous--it's just stupid!\"\n\n\"It's dangerous,\" said Paresi.\n\n\"Dangerous how?\" Ives demanded.\n\n\"For one thing--\" Paresi nodded toward Johnny, who lay tensely, his face\nhidden. \"For another, the simple calculation that if nothing inside this\nship made that control fail, something outside this ship did it. And\n_that_ I don't like.\"\n\n\"That couldn't happen,\" said the Captain reasonably.\n\nParesi snorted impatiently. \"Which of two mutually exclusive facts are\nyou going to reason from? That the ship can't fail? Then this failure\nisn't a failure; it's an external control. Or are you going to reason\nthat the ship _can_ fail? Then you don't have to worry about an external\nforce--but you can't trust anything about the ship. Do the trick that\nmakes you happy. But do only one. You can't have both.\"\n\n\nJohnny began to laugh.\n\nIves went to him. \"Hey, boy--\"\n\nJohnny rolled over, swung his feet down, and sat up, brushing the fat\nman aside. \"What you guys need,\" Johnny chuckled, \"is a nice kind\npoliceman to feed you candy and take you home. You're real lost.\"\n\nIves said, \"Johnny, take it easy and be quiet, huh? We'll figure a way\nout of this.\"\n\n\"I already have, scrawny,\" said Johnny offensively. He got up, strode to\nthe port. \"What a bunch of deadheads,\" he growled. He went two steps\npast the port and grasped the control-wheel which was mounted on the\nother side of the port from the button.\n\n\"Oh my God,\" breathed Anderson delightedly, \"the manual! Anybody else\nwant to be Captain?\"\n\n\"Factor of safety,\" said Hoskins, smiting himself on the brow. \"There's\na manual control for everything on this scow that there can be. And we\nstand here staring at it--\"\n\n\"If we don't win the furlined teacup....\" Ives laughed.\n\nJohnny hauled on the wheel.\n\nIt wouldn't budge.\n\n\"Here--\" Ives began to approach.\n\n\"Get away,\" said Johnny. He put his hands close together on the rim of\nthe wheel, settled his big shoulders, and hauled. With a sharp crack the\nwheel broke off in his hands.\n\nJohnny staggered, then stood. He looked at the wheel and then up at the\nbroken end of its shaft, gleaming deep below the surface of the\nbulkhead.\n\n\"Oh, fine....\" Ives whispered.\n\nSuddenly Johnny threw back his head and loosened a burst of high,\nhysterical laughter. It echoed back and forth between the metal walls\nlike a torrent from a burst dam. It went on and on, as if now that the\ndam was gone, the flood would run forever.\n\nAnderson called out \"Johnny!\" three times, but the note of command had\nno effect. Paresi walked to the pilot and with the immemorial practice\nslapped him sharply across the cheeks. \"Johnny! Stop it!\"\n\nThe laughter broke off as suddenly as it had begun. Johnny's chest\nheaved, drawing in breath with great, rasping near-sobs. Slowly they\ndied away. He extended the wheel toward the Captain.\n\n\"It broke off,\" he said, finally, dully, without emphasis.\n\nThen he leaned back against the hull, slowly slid down until he was\nsitting on the deck. \"Broke right off,\" he said.\n\nIves twined his fat fingers together and bent them until the knuckles\ncracked. \"Now what?\"\n\n\"I suggest,\" said Paresi, in an extremely controlled tone, \"that we all\nsit down and think over the whole thing very carefully.\"\n\n\nHoskins had been staring hypnotically at the broken shaft deep in the\nwall. \"I wonder,\" he said at length, \"which way Johnny turned that\nwheel.\"\n\n\"Counter-clockwise,\" said Ives. \"You saw him.\"\n\n\"I know that,\" said Hoskins. \"I mean, which way: the right way, or the\nwrong way?\"\n\n\"Oh.\" There was a short silence. Then Ives said, \"I guess we'll never\nknow, now.\"\n\n\"Not until we get back to Earth,\" said Paresi quickly.\n\n\"You say 'until', or 'unless'?\" Ives demanded.\n\n\"I said 'until', Ives,\" said Paresi levelly, \"and watch your mouth.\"\n\n\"Sometimes,\" said the fat man with a dangerous joviality, \"you pick the\nwrong way to say the right thing, Nick.\" Then he clapped the slender\ndoctor on the back. \"But I'll be good. We sow no panic seed, do we?\"\n\n\"Much better not to,\" said the Captain. \"It's being done efficiently\nenough from outside.\"\n\n\"You are convinced it's being done from outside?\" asked Hoskins, peering\nat him owlishly.\n\n\"I'm ... convinced of very little,\" said the Captain heavily. He went to\nthe acceleration couch and sat down. \"I want out,\" he said. He waved\naway the professional comment he could see forming on Paresi's lips and\nwent on, \"Not claustrophobia, Nick. Getting out of the ship's more\nimportant than just relieving our feelings. If the trouble with the port\nis being caused by some fantastic _something_ outside this ship, we'll\nachieve a powerful victory over it, purely by ignoring it.\"\n\n\"It broke off,\" murmured Johnny.\n\n\"Ignore _that_,\" snorted Ives.\n\n\"You keep talking about this thing being caused by something outside,\"\nsaid Paresi. His tone was almost complaining.\n\n\"Got a better hypothesis?\" asked Hoskins.\n\n\n\"Hoskins,\" said the Captain, \"isn't there some way we can get out? What\nabout the tubes?\"\n\n\"Take a shipyard to move those power-plants,\" said Hoskins, \"and even if\nit could be done, those radioactive tubes would fry you before you\ncrawled a third of the way.\"\n\n\"We should have a lifeboat,\" said Ives to no one in particular.\n\n\"What in time does a ship like the _Ambassador_ need with a lifeboat?\"\nasked Hoskins in genuine amazement.\n\nThe Captain frowned. \"What about the ventilators?\"\n\n\"Take us days to remove all the screens and purifiers,\" said Hoskins,\n\"and then we'd be up against the intake ports. You could stroll out\nthrough any of them about as far as your forearm. And after that it's\nhull-metal, skipper. _That_ you don't cut, not with a piece of the Sun's\ncore.\"\n\n\nThe Captain got up and began pacing, slowly and steadily, as if the\nproblem could be trodden out like ripe grapes. He closed his eyes and\nsaid, \"I've been circling around that idea for thirty minutes now. Look:\nthe hull can't be cut because it is built so it can't fail. It doesn't\nfail. The port controls were also built so they wouldn't fail. They do\nfail. The thing that keeps us in stays in shape. The thing that lets us\nout goes bad. Effect: we stay inside. Cause: something that wants us to\nstay inside.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Johnny clearly.\n\nThey looked at him. He raised his head, stiffened his spine against the\nbulkhead. Paresi smiled at him. \"Sure, Johnny. The machine didn't fail.\nIt was--controlled. It's all right.\" Then he turned to the Captain and\nsaid carefully, \"I'm not denying what you say, Skipper. But I don't like\nto think of what will happen if you take that tack, reason it through,\nand don't get any answers.\"\n\n\"I'd hate to be a psychologist,\" said Ives fervently. \"Do you\nextrapolate your mastications, too, and get frightened of the stink you\nmight get?\"\n\nParesi smiled coldly. \"I control my projections.\"\n\nCaptain Anderson's lips twitched in passing amusement, and then his\nexpression sobered. \"I'll take the challenge, Paresi. We have a cause\nand an effect. Something is keeping us in the ship. Corollary: We--or\nperhaps the ship--we're not welcome.\"\n\n\n\"_Men of Earth,_\" quoted Ives, in an excellent imitation of the\naccentless English they had heard on the radio, \"_welcome to our\nplanet._\"\n\n\"They're kidding,\" said Johnny heartily, rising to his feet. He dropped\nthe control wheel with a clang and shoved it carelessly aside with his\nfoot. \"Who ever says exactly what they mean anyhow? I see that\nconclusion the head-shrinker's afraid you'll get to, Skipper. If we\ncan't leave the ship, the only other thing we can do is to leave the\nplanet. That it?\"\n\nParesi nodded and watched the Captain closely. Anderson turned abruptly\naway from them all and stood, feet apart, head down, hands behind his\nback, and stared out of the forward viewports. In the tense silence they\ncould hear his knuckles crack. At length he said quietly, \"That isn't\nwhat we came here for, Johnny.\"\n\nJohnny shrugged. \"Okay. Chew it up all you like, fellers. The only other\nchoice is to sit here like bugs in a bottle until we die of old age.\nWhen you get tired of thinking that over, just let me know. I'll fly you\nout.\"\n\n\"We can always depend on Johnny,\" said Paresi with no detectible\nemphasis at all.\n\n\"Not on me,\" said Johnny, and swatted the bulkhead. \"On the ship.\nNothing on any planet can stop this baby once I pour on the coal. She's\njust got too much muscles.\"\n\n\"Well, Captain?\" asked Hoskins softly.\n\nAnderson looked at the basking valley, at the too-blue sky and the\nnear-familiar, mellow-weathered crags. They waited.\n\n\"Take her up,\" said the Captain. \"Put her in orbit at two hundred kilos.\nI'm not giving up this easily.\"\n\nIves swatted Johnny's broad shoulder. \"That's a take-off _and_ a\nlanding, if I know the Old Man. Go to it, Jets.\"\n\n\nJohnny's wide white grin flashed and he strode to the control chair.\n\"Gentlemen, be seated.\"\n\n\"I'll take mine lying down,\" said Ives, and spread his bulk out on the\nacceleration couch. The others went to their take-off posts.\n\n\"On automatics,\" said the Captain, \"Fire away!\"\n\n\"Fire away!\" said Johnny cheerfully. He reached forward and pressed the\ncentral control.\n\nNothing happened.\n\nJohnny put his hand toward the control again. It moved as if there were\na repellor field around the button. The hand moved more and more slowly\nthe closer it got, until it hovered just over the control and began to\ntremble.\n\n\"On manual,\" barked the Captain. \"Fire!\"\n\n\"Manual, sir,\" said Johnny reflexively. His trembling hand darted up to\nan overhead switch, pulled it. He grasped the control bars and dropped\nthe heels of his hands heavily on the firing studs. From somewhere came\na muted roar, a whispering; a subjective suggestion of the thunder of\nreaction motors.\n\nA frown crossed Paresi's face. The rocket noise was gone as the mind\nreached for it, like an occluded thought. The motors were silent; there\nwasn't a tremor of vibration. Yet somewhere a ghost engine was warming\nup, preparing a ghost ship for an intangible take-off into nothingness.\n\nHe snapped off the catch of his safety belt and crossed swiftly and\nsilently to the console. Johnny sat raptly. A slow smile of satisfaction\nbegan to spread over his face. His gaze flicked to dials and gauges; he\nnodded very slightly, and brought both hands down like an organist\nplaying a mighty chord. He watched the gauges. The needles were still,\nlying on their zero pins, and where lights should have flickered and\nflashed there was nothing. Paresi glanced at Anderson and met a worried\nlook. Hoskins had his head cocked to one side, listening, puzzled. Ives\nrose from the couch and came forward to stand beside Paresi.\n\nJohnny was manipulating the keys firmly. His fingers began to play a\nrapid, skillful, silent concerto. His face had a look of intense\nconcentration and of complete self-confidence.\n\n\"Well,\" said Ives heavily. \"That's a bust, too.\"\n\nParesi spun to him. \"_Shh!_\" It was done with such intensity that Ives\nrecoiled. With a warning look at him, Paresi walked to the Captain,\nwhispered in his ear.\n\n\"My God,\" said Anderson. \"All right, Doctor.\" He came forward to the\npilot's chair. Johnny was still concentratedly, uselessly at work.\nAnderson glanced inquiringly at Paresi, who nodded.\n\n\"That does it,\" said the Captain, loudly. \"Nice work, Johnny. We're\nsmack in orbit. The automatics couldn't have done it better. For once it\nfeels good to be out in space again. Cut your jets now. You can check\nfor correction later.\"\n\n\"Aye, sir,\" said Johnny. He made two delicate adjustments, threw a\nmaster switch and swung around. \"Whew! That's work!\"\n\nFacing the four silent men, Johnny thumbed out a cigarette, put it in\nhis mouth, touched his lighter to it, drew a long slow puff.\n\n\"Man, that goes good....\"\n\nThe cigarette was not lighted. Hoskins turned away, an expression of\nsick pity on his face. Ives reached abruptly for his own lighter, and\nthe doctor checked him with a gesture.\n\n\"Every time I see a hot pilot work I'm amazed,\" Paresi said\nconversationally. \"Such concentration ... you must be tuckered, Johnny.\"\n\nJohnny puffed at his unlit cigarette. \"Tuckered,\" he said. \"Yeah.\" There\nwere two odd undertones to his voice suddenly. They were fatigue, and\neagerness. Paresi said, \"You're off-watch, John. Go stretch out.\"\n\n\"Real tired,\" mumbled Johnny. He lumbered to his feet and went aft,\nwhere he rolled to the couch and was almost instantly asleep.\n\n\nThe others congregated far forward around the controls, and for a long\nmoment stared silently at the sleeping pilot.\n\n\"I don't get it,\" murmured Ives.\n\n\"He really thought he flew us out, didn't he?\" asked Hoskins.\n\nParesi nodded. \"Had to. There isn't any place in his cosmos for machines\nthat don't work. Contrary evidence can get just so strong. Then, for\nhim, it ceased to exist. A faulty cigarette lighter irritated him, a\nfailing airlock control made him angry and sullen and then hysterical.\nWhen the drive controls wouldn't respond, he reached his breaking point.\nEveryone has such a breaking point, and arrives at it just that way if\nhe's pushed far enough.\"\n\n\"Everyone?\"\n\nParesi looked from face to face, and nodded somberly. Anderson asked,\n\"What knocked him out? He's trained to take far more strain than that.\"\n\n\"Oh, he isn't suffering from any physical or conscious mental fatigue.\nThe one thing he wanted to do was to get away from a terrifying\nsituation. He convinced himself that he flew out of it. The next best\nthing he could do to keep anything else from attacking him was to sleep.\nHe very much appreciated my suggestion that he was worn out and needed\nto stretch out.\"\n\n\"I'd very much appreciate some such,\" said Ives. \"Do it to me, Nick.\"\n\n\"Reach your breaking point first,\" said the doctor flatly, and went to\nplace a pillow between Johnny's head and a guard-rail.\n\nHoskins turned away to stare at the peaceful landscape outside. The\nCaptain watched him for a moment, then: \"Hoskins!\"\n\n\"Aye.\"\n\n\"I've seen that expression before. What are you thinking about?\"\n\nThe engineer looked at him, shrugged, and said mildly, \"Chess.\"\n\n\"What, especially?\"\n\n\"Oh, a very general thing. The reciprocity of the game. That's what\nmakes it the magnificent thing it is. Most human enterprises can gang up\non a man, slap him with one disaster after another without pause. But\nnot chess. No matter who your opponent might be, every time he does\nsomething to you, _it's your move_.\"\n\n\"Very comforting. Have you any idea of how we move now?\"\n\nHoskins looked at him, a gentle surprise on his aging face. \"You missed\nmy point, Skipper. _We_ don't move.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" the Captain whispered. His face tautened as it paled, \"I ... I\nsee. We pushed the airlock button to get out. Countermove: It wouldn't\nwork. We tried the manual. Countermove: It broke off. And so on. Now\nwe've tried to fly the ship out. Oh, but Hoskins--Johnny broke. Isn't\nthat countermove enough?\"\n\n\"Maybe. Maybe you're right. Maybe the move wasn't trying the drive\ncontrols, though. Maybe the move was to do what was necessary to knock\nJohnny out.\" He shrugged again. \"We'll very soon see.\"\n\nThe Captain exhaled explosively through his nostrils. \"We'll find out if\nit's our move by moving,\" he gritted. \"Ives! Paresi! We're going to go\nover this thing from the beginning. First, try the port. You, Ives.\"\n\nIves grunted and went to the ship's side. Then he stopped.\n\n\"_Where is the port?_\"\n\nAnderson and Paresi followed Ives' flaccid, shocked gaze to the bulkhead\nwhere there had been the outline of the closed port, and beside it the\nhole which had held the axle of the manual wheel, and which now was a\nsmooth, seamless curtain of impenetrable black. But Hoskins looked at\nthe Captain first of all, and he said \"_Now_ it's our move,\" and only\nthen did he turn with them to look at the darkness.\n\n\n\n\n                    III\n\n    _The unfamiliar, you say, is the unseen, the completely new and\n    strange? Not so. The epitome of the unfamiliar is the familiar\n    inverted, the familiar turned on its head. View a familiar place\n    under new conditions--a deserted and darkened theater, an empty\n    night club by day--and you will find yourself more influenced by\n    the emotion of strangeness than by any number of unseen places.\n    Go back to your old neighborhood and find everything changed.\n    Come into your own home when everyone is gone, when the lights\n    are out and the furniture rearranged--there I will show you the\n    strange and frightening ghosts that are the shapes left over\n    when reality superimposes itself upon the images of memory. The\n    goblins lurk in the shadows of your own room...._\n        Owen Miller\n        Essays on Night and the Unfamiliar\n\n\nFor one heart-stopping moment the darkness had seemed to swoop in upon\nthem like the clutching hand of death. Instinctively they had huddled\ntogether in the center of the room. But when the second look, and the\nthird, gave them reassurance that the effect was really there, though\nthe cause was still a mystery, then half the mystery was gone, and they\nbegan to drift apart. Each felt on trial, and held tight to himself and\nthe picture of himself he empathized in the others' eyes.\n\nThe Captain said quietly, \"It's just ... there. It doesn't seem to be\nspreading.\"\n\nHoskins gazed at it critically. \"About half a meter deep,\" he murmured.\n\"What do you suppose it's made of?\"\n\n\"Not a gas,\" said Paresi. \"It has a--a sort of surface.\"\n\nIves, who had frozen to the spot when first he saw the blackness on his\nway to the port, took another two steps. The hand which had been half\nlifted to touch the control continued upward relievedly, as if glad to\nhave a continuous function even though its purpose had changed.\n\n\"Don't touch it!\" rapped the Captain.\n\nIves turned his head to look at the Captain, then faltered and let the\nhand drop. \"Why not?\"\n\n\"Certainly not a liquid,\" Paresi mused, as if there had been no\ninterruption. \"And if it's a solid, where did that much matter come\nfrom? Through the hull?\"\n\nHoskins, who knew the hull, how it was made, how fitted, how treated\nonce it was in place, snorted at the idea.\n\n\"If it was a gas,\" said Paresi, \"there'd be diffusion. _And_ convection.\nIf it were poisonous, we'd all be dead. If not, the chances are we'd\nsmell it. And the counter's not saying a thing--so it's not\nradioactive.\"\n\n\"You trust the counter?\" asked Ives bitterly.\n\n\"I trust it,\" said Paresi. His near-whisper shook with what sounded like\npassion. \"A man must have faith in something. I hold that faith in every\nsingle function of every part of this ship until each and every part is\nseparately and distinctly proved unworthy of faith!\"\n\n\"Then, by God, you'll understand my faith in my own two hands and what\nthey feel,\" snarled Ives. He stepped to the bulkhead and brought his\nmeaty hand hard against it.\n\n\"_Touch\u00e9_,\" murmured Hoskins, and meant either Ives' remark or the flat,\nsolid smack of the hand against the blackness.\n\n\nIn his sleep, Johnny uttered a high, soft, careless tinkle of youthful,\nhappy laughter.\n\n\"Somebody's happy,\" said Ives.\n\n\"Paresi,\" said the Captain, \"what happens when he wakes up?\"\n\nParesi's eyebrows shrugged for him. \"Practically anything. He's reached\ndown inside himself, somewhere, and found a way out. For him--not for\nany of the rest of us. Maybe he'll ignore what we see. Maybe he'll think\nhe's somewhere else, or in some other time. Maybe he'll _be_ someone\nelse. Maybe he won't wake up at all.\"\n\n\"Maybe he has the right idea,\" said Ives.\n\n\"That's the second time you've made a crack like that,\" said Paresi\nlevelly. \"Don't do it again. You can't afford it.\"\n\n\"We can't afford it,\" the Captain put in.\n\n\"All right,\" said Ives, with such docility that Paresi shot him a\nstartled, suspicious glance. The big communications man went to his\nstation and sat, half-turned away from the rest.\n\n\"What are they after?\" complained the Captain suddenly. \"What do they\nwant?\"\n\n\"Who?\" asked Paresi, still watching Ives.\n\nHoskins explained, \"Whoever it was who said 'Welcome to our planet.'\"\n\nIves turned toward them, and Paresi's relief was noticeable. Ives said,\n\"They want us dead.\"\n\n\"Do they?\" asked the Captain.\n\n\"They don't want us to leave the ship, and they don't want the ship to\nleave the planet.\"\n\n\"Then it's the ship they want.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" amended Ives, \"without us.\"\n\nParesi said, \"You can't conclude that, Ives. They've inconvenienced us.\nThey've turned us in on ourselves, and put a drain on our intangible\nresources as men and as a crew. But so far they haven't actually done\nanything to us. We've done it to ourselves.\"\n\nIves looked at him scornfully. \"We wrecked the unwreckable controls,\nmanufactured that case-hardened darkness, and talked to ourselves on an\nall-wave carrier with no source, about information no outsider could\nget?\"\n\n\"I didn't say any of that.\" Paresi paused to choose words. \"Of course\nthey're responsible for these phenomena. But the phenomena haven't hurt\nus. Our reactions to the phenomena are what has done the damage.\"\n\n\"A fall never hurt anyone, they told me when I was a kid,\" said Ives\npugnaciously. \"It's the sudden stop.\"\n\nParesi dismissed the remark with a shrug. \"I still say that while we\nhave been astonished, frightened, puzzled and frustrated, we have not\nbeen seriously threatened. Our water and food and air are virtually\nunlimited. Our ability to live with one another under emergency\nsituations has been tested to a fare-thee-well, and all we have to do is\nrecognize the emergency as such and that ability will rise to optimum.\"\nHe smiled suddenly. \"It could be worse, Ives.\"\n\n\"I suppose it could,\" said Ives. \"That blackness could move in until it\nreally crowded us, or--\"\n\nVery quietly Hoskins said, \"It _is_ moving in.\"\n\nCaptain Anderson shook his head. \"No....\" And hearing him, they slowly\nrecognized that the syllable was not a denial, but an exclamation. For\nthe darkness was no longer a half-meter deep on the bulkhead. No one had\nnoticed it, but they suddenly became aware that the almost-square cabin\nwas now definitely rectangular, with the familiar controls, the\ncommunications wall, and the thwartship partition aft of them forming\nthree sides to the encroaching fourth.\n\n[Illustration: Nude woman on chess motif.]\n\nIves rose shaking and round-eyed from his chair. He made an unspellable\nanimal sound and rushed at the blackness. Paresi leaped for him, but not\nfast enough. Ives collided sickeningly against the strange jet surface\nand fell. He fell massively, gracelessly, not prone but on wide-spread\nknees, with his arms crumpled beneath him and the side of his face on\nthe deck. He stayed there, quite unconscious, a gross caricature of\nworship.\n\nThere was a furiously active, silent moment while Paresi turned the fat\nman over on his back, ran skilled fingers over his bleeding face, his\nchest, back to the carotid area of his neck. \"He's all right,\" said\nParesi, still working; then, as if to keep his mind going with words to\navoid conjecture, he went on didactically, \"This is the other fear\nreaction. Johnny's was 'flight.' Ives' is 'fight.' The empirical result\nis very much the same.\"\n\n\"I thought,\" said Hoskins dryly, \"that fight and flight were survival\nreactions.\"\n\nParesi stood up. \"Why, they are. In the last analysis, so is suicide.\"\n\n\"I'll think about that,\" said Hoskins softly.\n\n\"Paresi!\" spat Anderson. \"Medic or no, you'll watch your mouth!\"\n\n\"Sorry, Captain. That _was_ panic seed. Hoskins--\"\n\n\"Don't explain it to me,\" said the engineer mildly. \"I know what you\nmeant. Suicide's the direct product of survival compulsions--drives that\ntry to save something, just as fight and flight are efforts to save\nsomething. I don't think you need worry; immolation doesn't tempt me.\nI'm too--too interested in what goes on. What are you going to do about\nIves?\"\n\n\"Bunk him, I guess, and stand by to fix up that headache he'll wake up\nto. Give me a hand, will you?\"\n\nHoskins went to the bulkhead and dropped a second acceleration couch. It\ntook all three of them, working hard, to lift Ives' great bulk up to it.\nParesi opened the first-aid kit clamped under the control console and\nwent to the unconscious man. The Captain cast about him for something to\ndo, something to say, and apparently found it. \"Hoskins!\"\n\n\"Aye.\"\n\n\"Do you usually think better on an empty stomach?\"\n\n\"Not me.\"\n\n\"I never have either.\"\n\nHoskins smiled. \"I can take a hint. I'll rassle up something hot and\nfilling.\"\n\n\"Good man,\" said the Captain, as Hoskins disappeared toward the after\nquarters. Anderson walked over to the doctor and stood watching him\nclean up the abraded bruise on Ives' forehead.\n\nParesi, without looking up, said, \"You'd better say it, whatever it is.\nGet it out.\"\n\nAnderson half-chuckled. \"You psychic?\"\n\nParesi shot him a glance. \"Depends. If you mean has a natural\nsensitivity to the tension spectra coupled itself with some years of\npractice in observing people--then yes. What's on your mind?\"\n\n\nAnderson said nothing for a long time. It was as if he were waiting for\na question, a single prod from Paresi. But Paresi wouldn't give it.\nParesi waited, just waited, with his dark face turned away, not helping,\nnot pushing, not doing a single thing to modify the pressure that\nchurned about in the Captain.\n\n\"All right,\" said the Captain irritably. \"I'll tell you.\"\n\nParesi took tweezers, a retractor, two scalpels and a hypodermic case\nout of the kit and laid them in a neat row on the bunk. He then picked\nup each one and returned it to the kit. When he had quite finished\nAnderson said, \"I was wondering, _who's next?_\"\n\nParesi nodded and shut the kit with a sharp click. He looked up at the\nCaptain and nodded again. \"Why does it have to be you?\" he asked.\n\n\"I didn't say it would be me!\" said the Captain sharply.\n\n\"Didn't you?\" When the Captain had no answer, Paresi asked him, \"Then\nwhy wonder about a thing like that?\"\n\n\"Oh ... I see what you mean. When you start to be afraid, you start to\nbe unsure--not of anyone else's weaknesses, but of your own. That what\nyou mean?\"\n\n\"Yup.\" His dark-framed grin flashed suddenly. \"But you're not afraid,\nCap'n.\"\n\n\"The hell I'm not.\"\n\nParesi shook his head. \"Johnny was afraid, and fled. Ives was afraid,\nand fought. There's only one fear that's a real fear, and that's the one\nthat brings you to your breaking point. Any other fear is small potatoes\ncompared with a terror like that. Small enough so no one but me has to\nworry about it.\"\n\n\"Why you, then?\"\n\nParesi swatted the first-aid kit as he carried it back to its clamp.\n\"I'm the M. O., remember? Symptoms are my business. Let me watch 'em,\nCaptain. Give me orders, but don't crowd me in my specialty.\"\n\n\n\"You're insubordinate, Paresi,\" said Anderson, \"and you're a great\ncomfort.\" His slight smile faded, and horizontal furrows appeared over\nhis eyes. \"Tell me why I had that nasty little phase of doubt about\nmyself.\"\n\n\"You think I can?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" He was certain.\n\n\"That's half the reason. The other half is Hoskins.\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\"\n\n\"Johnny broke. Ives broke. Your question was, 'who's next?' You doubt\nthat it will be me, because I'm _de facto_ the boy with all the answers.\nYou doubt it will be Hoskins, because you can't extrapolate how he might\nbreak--or even if he would. So that leaves you.\"\n\n\"I hadn't exactly reasoned it out like that--\"\n\n\"Oh yes you had,\" said Paresi, and thumped the Captain's shoulder. \"Now\nforget it. Confucius say he who turn gaze inward wind up crosseyed.\nCan't afford to have a crosseyed Captain. Our friends out there are due\nto make another move.\"\n\n\"No they're not.\"\n\n\nThe doctor and the Captain whirled at the quiet voice. \"What does that\nmean, Hoskins?\"\n\nThe engineer came into the cabin, crossed over to his station, and began\nopening and closing drawers. \"They've moved.\" From the bottom drawer he\npulled out a folded chessboard and a rectangular box. Only then did he\nlook directly at them. \"The food's gone.\"\n\n\"Food?... gone where?\"\n\nHoskins smiled tiredly. \"Where's the port? Where's the outboard\nbulkhead? That black stuff has covered it up--heating units,\nfoodlockers, disposal unit, everything.\" He pulled a couple of chairs\nfrom their clips on the bulkhead and carried them across the cabin to\nthe sheet of blackness. \"There's water,\" he said as he unfolded the\nchairs. On the seat of one he placed the chessboard. He sat on the other\nand pushed the board close to the darkness. \"The scuttlebutt's inboard,\nand still available.\" His voice seemed to get fainter and fainter as he\ntalked, as if he were going slowly away from them. \"But there's no food.\nNo food.\"\n\nHe began to set up the pieces, his face to the black wall.\n\n\n\n\n                    IV\n\n    _The primary function of personality is self-preservation, but\n    personality itself is not a static but a dynamic thing.

Cut it!\" Very softly, he said, \"Leave him alone. He's doing\nwhat he has to do.\"\n\nAnderson stared over his shoulder at the little engineer. \"Is he, now?\nDamn it, he's still under orders!\"\n\n\"Got something for him to do?\" asked the doctor cooly.\n\nAnderson looked around, at the controls, out at the sleeping mountains.\n\"I guess not. But I'd like to know he'd take an order when I have one.\"\n\n\"Leave him alone until you have an order. Hoskins is a very steady head,\nskipper. But just now he's on the outside edge. Don't push.\"\n\nThe Captain put his hand over his eyes and fumbled his way to the\ncontrols. He turned his back to the pilot's chair and leaned heavily\nagainst it. \"Okay,\" he said. \"This thing is developing into a duel\nbetween you and those ... those colleagues of yours out there. I guess\nthe least we ... I ... can do is not to fight you while you're fighting\nthem.\"\n\nParesi said, \"You're choosing up sides the wrong way. They're fighting\nus, all right. We're only fighting ourselves. I don't mean each other; I\nmean each of us is fighting himself. We've got to stop doing that,\nskipper.\"\n\nThe Captain gave him a wan smile. \"Who has, at the best of times?\"\n\nParesi returned the smile. \"Drug addicts ... Catatonics ...\nillusionaries ... and saints. I guess it's up to us to add to the\ncategory.\"\n\n\"How about dead people?\"\n\n\"Ives! How long have you been awake?\"\n\n\nThe big man shoved himself up and leaned on one arm. He shook his head\nand grunted as if he had been punched in the solar plexus. \"Who hit me\nwith what?\" he said painfully, from between clenched teeth.\n\n\"You apparently decided the bulkhead was a paper hoop and tried to dive\nthrough it,\" said Paresi. He spoke lightly but his face was watchful.\n\n\"Oooh....\" Ives held his head for a moment and then peered between his\nfingers at the darkness. \"I remember,\" he said in a strained whisper. He\nlooked around him, saw the engineer huddled against his chessboard.\n\"What's he doing?\"\n\nThey all looked at the engineer as he moved a piece and then sat\nquietly.\n\n\"Hey, Hoskins!\"\n\nHoskins ignored Ives' bull voice. Paresi said, \"He's not talking just\nnow. He's ... all right, Ives. Leave him alone. At the moment, I'm more\ninterested in you. How do you feel?\"\n\n\"Me, I feel great. Hungry, though. What's for chow?\"\n\nAnderson said quickly, \"Nick doesn't want us to eat just now.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" muttered Paresi in vicious irony.\n\n\"He's the doctor,\" said Ives good-naturedly. \"But don't put it off too\nlong, huh? This furnace needs stoking.\" He fisted his huge chest.\n\n\"Well, this is encouraging,\" said Paresi.\n\n\"It certainly is,\" said the Captain. \"Maybe the breaking point is just\nthe point of impact. After that the rebound, hm?\"\n\nParesi shook his head. \"Breaking means breaking. Sometimes things just\ndon't break.\"\n\n\n\"Got to pass,\" said a voice. Johnny, the pilot, was stirring.\n\n\"Ha!\" Anderson's voice was exultant. \"Here comes another one!\"\n\n\"How sure are you of that?\" asked the doctor. To Johnny, he called,\n\"Hiya, John?\"\n\n\"I got to pass,\" said Johnny worriedly. He swung his feet to the deck.\n\"You see,\" he said earnestly, \"being the head of your class doesn't make\nit any easier. You've got to keep that and pass the examinations too.\nYou've got two jobs. Now, the guy who stands fourth, say--he has only\none job to do.\"\n\nAnderson turned a blank face to Paresi, who made a silencing gesture.\nJohnny put his head in his hands and said, \"When one variable varies\ndirectly as another, two pairs of their corresponding values are in\nproportion.\" He looked up. \"That's supposed to be the keystone of all\nvector analysis, the man says, and you don't get to be a pilot without\nvector analysis. And it makes no sense to me. What am I going to do?\"\n\n\"Get some shuteye,\" said Paresi immediately. \"You've been studying too\nhard. It'll make more sense to you in the morning.\"\n\nJohnny grinned and yawned at the same time, the worried wrinkles\nsmoothing out. \"Now that was a real educational remark, Martin, old\nchap,\" he said. He lay down and stretched luxuriously. \"_That_ I can\nunderstand. You may wear my famous maroon zipsuit.\" He turned his face\naway and was instantly asleep.\n\n\"Who the hell is Martin?\" Ives demanded. \"Martin who?\"\n\n\"Shh. Probably his roommate in pre-pilot school.\"\n\nAnderson gaped. \"You mean he's back in school?\"\n\n\"Doesn't it figure?\" said Paresi sadly. \"I told you that this situation\nis intolerable to him. If he can't escape in space, he'll escape in\ntime. He hasn't the imagination to go forward, so he goes backward.\"\n\nSomething scuttled across the floor. Ives whipped his feet off the floor\nand sat like some cartoon of a Buddha, clutching his ankles. \"What in\nGod's name was that?\"\n\n\"I didn't see anything,\" said Paresi.\n\nThe Captain demanded, \"What was it?\"\n\nFrom the shadows, Hoskins said, \"A mouse.\"\n\n\"Nonsense.\"\n\n\"I can't stand things that scuttle and slither and crawl,\" said Ives.\nHis voice was suddenly womanish. \"Don't let anything like that in here!\"\n\nFrom the quarters aft came a faint scratching, a squeak. Ives turned\npale. His wattles quivered.\n\n\"Snap out of it, Ives,\" said Paresi coldly. \"There isn't so much as a\nmicrobe on this ship that I haven't inventoried. Don't sit there like\nlittle Miss Muffet.\"\n\n\"I know what I saw,\" said Ives. He rose suddenly, turned to the black\nwall, and bellowed, \"Damn you, send something I can fight!\"\n\n\nTwo mice emerged from under the couch. One of them ran over Ives' foot.\nThey disappeared aft, squeaking. Ives leapt straight up and came down\nstanding on the couch. Anderson stepped back against the inboard\nbulkhead and stood rigid. Paresi walked with great purpose to the\nmedical chest, took out a small black case and opened it.\n\nIves cowered down to his knees and began to blubber openly, without\nattempting to hide it, without any articulate speech. Paresi approached\nhim, half-concealing a small metal tube in his hand.\n\nA slight movement on the deck caught Anderson's eye. He was unable to\ncontrol a shrill intake of breath as an enormous spider, hairy and\nswift, darted across to the couch and sprang. It landed next to Ives'\nknee, sprang again. Paresi swung at it and missed, his hand catching\nIves heavily just under the armpit. The spider hit the deck, skidded,\nrighted itself and, abruptly, was gone. Ives caved in around the impact\npoint of Paresi's hand and curled up silently on the couch. Anderson ran\nto him.\n\n\"He'll be all right now,\" said Paresi. \"Forget it.\"\n\n\"Don't tell me he fainted! Not Ives!\"\n\n\"Of course not.\" Paresi held up the little cylinder.\n\n\"Anesthox! Why did you use that on him?\"\n\nParesi said irritably, \"For the reason one usually uses anesthox. To\nknock a patient out for a couple of hours without hurting him.\"\n\n\"Suppose you hadn't?\"\n\n\"How much more of that scuttle-and-slither treatment do you think he\ncould have taken?\"\n\nAnderson looked at the unconscious communications man. \"Surely more than\nthat.\" He looked up suddenly. \"Where the hell _did_ that vermin come\nfrom?\"\n\n\"Ah. Now you have it. He dislikes mice and spiders. But there was\nsomething special about these. They couldn't be here, and they were. He\nfelt that it was a deliberate and personal attack. He couldn't have\nhandled much more of it.\"\n\n\"Where did they come from?\" demanded the Captain again.\n\n\"_I_ don't know!\" snapped Paresi. \"Sorry, skipper ... I'm a little\nunnerved. I'm not used to seeing a patient's hallucinations. Not that\nclearly, at any rate.\"\n\n\"They were Ives' hallucinations?\"\n\n\"Can you recall what was said just before they appeared?\"\n\n\"Uh ... something scuttled. A mouse.\"\n\n\"It wasn't a mouse until someone said it was.\" The doctor turned and\nlooked searchingly at Hoskins, who still sat quietly over his chess.\n\n\"By God, it was Hoskins. Hoskins--what made you say that?\"\n\nThe engineer did not move nor answer. Paresi shook his head hopelessly.\n\"Another retreat. It's no use, Captain.\"\n\n\nAnderson took a single step toward Hoskins, then obviously changed his\nmind. He shrugged and said, \"All right. Something scuttled and Hoskins\ndefined it. Let's accept that without reasoning it out. So who called up\nthe spider?\"\n\n\"You did.\"\n\n\"_I_ did?\"\n\nIn a startling imitation of the Captain's voice, Paresi quoted, \"Don't\nsit there like Miss Muffet!\"\n\n\"I'll be damned,\" said Anderson. \"Maybe we'd all be better off saying\nnothing.\"\n\nParesi said bitterly, \"You think it makes any difference if we _say_\nwhat we think?\"\n\n\"Perhaps....\"\n\n\"Nup,\" said Paresi positively. \"Look at the way this thing works. First\nit traps us, and then it shows us a growing darkness. Very basic. Then\nit starts picking on us, one by one. Johnny gets machines that don't\nwork, when with his whole soul he worships machines that do. Ives gets a\nlarge charge of claustrophobia from the black stuff over there and goes\ninto a flat spin.\"\n\n\"He came out of it.\"\n\n\"Johnny woke up too. In another subjective time-track. Quite harmless\nto--to Them. So they left him alone. But they lowered the boom on Ives\nwhen he showed any resilience. It's breaking point they're after,\nCaptain. Nothing less.\"\n\n\"Hoskins?\"\n\n\"I guess so,\" said Paresi tiredly. \"Like Johnny he escaped from a\nproblem he couldn't handle to one he could. Only instead of regressing\nhe's turned to chess. I hope Johnny doesn't bounce back for awhile, yet.\nHe's too--Captain! He's gone!\"\n\nThey turned and stared at Johnny's bunk. Or--where the bunk had been\nbefore the black wall had swelled inwards and covered it.\n\n\n\n\n                     V\n\n    \"_... and there I was, Doctor, in the lobby of the hotel at\n    noon, stark naked!_\"\n\n    \"_Do you have these dreams often?_\"\n\n    \"_I'm afraid so, Doctor. Am I--all right? I mean_ ...\"\n\n    \"_Let me ask you this question: Do you believe that these\n    experiences are real?_\"\n\n    \"_Of course not!_\"\n\n    \"_Then, Madam, you are, by definition, sane; for insanity, in\n    the final analysis, is the inability to distinguish the real\n    from the unreal._\"\n\n\nParesi and the Captain ran aft together, and together they stopped four\npaces away from the bulging blackness.\n\n\"_Johnny!_\" The Captain's voice cracked with the agonized effort of his\ncry. He stepped to the black wall, pounded it with the heel of his hand.\n\n\"He won't hear you,\" said Paresi bleakly. \"Come back, Captain. Come\nback.\"\n\n\"Why him? Why Johnny? They've done everything they could to Johnny; you\nsaid so yourself!\"\n\n\"Come back,\" Paresi said again, soothing. Then he spoke briskly: \"Can't\nyou see they're not doing anything to him? They're doing it to us!\"\n\nThe Captain stood rigidly, staring at the featureless intrusion. He\nturned presently. \"To us,\" he parroted. Then he stumbled blindly to the\ndoctor, who put a firm hand on his biceps and walked with him to the\nforward acceleration couch.\n\nThe Captain sat down heavily with his back to this new invasion. Paresi\nstood by him reflectively, then walked silently to Hoskins.\n\nThe engineer sat over his chessboard in deep concentration. The far edge\nof the board seemed to be indefinite, lost partially in the mysterious\nsable curtain which covered the bulkhead.\n\n\"Hoskins.\"\n\nNo answer.\n\nParesi put his hand on Hoskins' shoulder. Hoskins' head came up slowly.\nHe did not turn it. His gaze was straight ahead into the darkness. But\nat least it was off the board.\n\n\"Hoskins,\" said Paresi, \"why are you playing chess?\"\n\n\"Chess is chess,\" said Hoskins quietly. \"Chess may symbolize any\nconflict, but it is chess and it will remain chess.\"\n\n\"Who are you playing with?\"\n\nNo answer.\n\n\"Hoskins--we need you. Help us.\"\n\nHoskins let his gaze travel slowly downward again until it was on the\nboard. \"The word is not the thing,\" he said. \"The number is not the\nthing. The picture, the ideograph, the symbol--these are not the thing.\nConversely ...\"\n\n\"Yes, Hoskins.\"\n\nParesi waited. Hoskins did not move or speak. Paresi put his hand on the\nman's shoulder again, but now there was no response. He cursed suddenly,\nbent and brought up his hand with a violent smash and sent board and\npieces flying.\n\n\nWhen the clatter had died down Hoskins said pleasantly, \"The pieces are\nnot the game. The symbols are not the thing.\" He sat still, his eyes\nfixed on the empty chair where the board had been. He put out a hand and\nmoved a piece where there was no piece to a square which was no longer\nthere. Then he sat and waited.\n\nParesi, breathing heavily, backed off, whirled, and went back to the\nCaptain.\n\nAnderson looked up at him, and there was the glimmer of humor in his\neyes. \"Better sit down and talk about something different, Doctor.\"\n\nParesi made an animal sound, soft and deep, far back in his throat,\nplumped down next to the Captain, and kneaded his hands together for a\nmoment. Then he smiled. \"Quite right, skipper. I'd better.\"\n\nThey sat quietly for a moment. Then the Captain prompted, \"About the\ndifferent breaking point....\"\n\n\"Yes, Captain?\"\n\n\"Perhaps you can put your finger on the thing that makes different men\nbreak in different ways, for different reasons. I mean, Johnny's case\nseemed pretty clear cut, and what you haven't explained about Hoskins,\nHoskins has demonstrated pretty clearly. About Ives, now--we can skip\nthat for the time he'll be unconscious. But if you can figure out where\nyou and I might break, why--we'd know what to look for.\"\n\n\"You think that would help?\"\n\n\"We'd be prepared.\"\n\nParesi looked at him sharply. \"Let's hypothesize a child who is afraid\nof the dark. Ask him and he might say that there's a _something_ in dark\nplaces that will jump out at him. Then assure him, with great authority,\nthat not only is he right but that it's about to jump any minute, and\nwhat have you done?\"\n\n\"Damage,\" nodded the Captain. \"But you wouldn't say that to the child.\nYou'd tell him there was nothing there. You'd _prove_ there wasn't.\"\n\n\"So I would,\" agreed the doctor. \"But in our case I couldn't do anything\nof the kind. Johnny broke over machines that really didn't work. Hoskins\nbroke over phenomena that couldn't be measured nor understood. Ives\nbroke over things that scuttled and crawled. Subjectively real\nphenomena, all of them. Whatever basic terrors hide in you and in me\nwill come to face us, no matter how improbable they might be. And you\nwant me to tell you what they are. No, skipper. Better leave them in\nyour subconscious, where you've buried them.\"\n\n\"I'm not afraid,\" said the Captain. \"Tell me, Paresi! At least I'll\nknow. I'd rather know. I'd so _damn_ much rather know!\"\n\n\"You're sure I can tell you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I haven't psychoanalyzed you, you know. Some of these things are very\nhard to--\"\n\n\"You do know, don't you?\"\n\n\n\"Damn you, yes!\" Paresi wet his lips. \"All right, then. I may be doing a\nwrong thing here.... You've cuddled up to the idea that I'm a very\nastute character who automatically knows about things like this, and\nit's been a comfort to you. Well, I've got news for you. I didn't figure\nall these things out. I was told.\"\n\n\"Told?\"\n\n\"Yes, told,\" said Paresi angrily. \"Look, this is supposed to be\nrestricted information, but the Exploration Service doesn't rely on\nindividual aptitude tests alone to make up a crew. There's another\nfactor--call it an inaptitude factor. In its simplest terms, it comes to\nthis: that a crew can't work together only if each member is the most\nefficient at his job. He has to _need_ the others, each one of the\nothers. And the word _need_ predicates _lack_. In other words, none of\nus is a balanced individual. And the imbalances are chosen to match and\nblend, so that we will react as a balanced unit. Sure I know Johnny's\nbugaboos, and Hoskins', and yours. They were all in my indoctrination\ntreatments. I know all your case histories, all your psychic\npush-buttons.\"\n\n\"And yours?\" demanded the Captain.\n\n\"Hoskins, for example,\" said Paresi. \"Happily married, no children.\nPhysically inferior all his life. Repressed desire for pure science\nwhich produced more than a smattering of a great many sciences and made\nhim a hell of an engineer. High idealistic quotient; self sacrifice.\nLook at him playing chess, making of this very real situation a\ntheoretical abstraction ... like leaving a marriage for deep space.\n\n\"Johnny we know about. Brought up with never failing machines. Still\nplays with them as if they were toys, and like any imaginative child,\nturns to his toys for reassurance. He needs to be a hero, hence the\nstars....\n\n\"Ives ... always fat. Learned to be easy-going, learned to laugh _with_\nwhen others were laughing _at_, and bottling up pressures every time it\nhappened. A large appetite. He's here to satisfy it; he's with us so he\ncan eat up the galaxies....\"\n\nThere was a long pause. \"Go on,\" said the Captain. \"Who's next? You?\"\n\n\"You,\" said the doctor shortly. \"You grew up with a burning curiosity\nabout the nature of things. But it wasn't a scientist's curiosity; it\nwas an aesthete's. You're one of the few people alive who refused a\nsubsidized education and worked your way through advanced studies as a\ncrewman on commercial space-liners. You became one of the youngest\nprofessors of philosophy in recent history. You made a romantic marriage\nand your wife died in childbirth. Since then--almost a hundred missions\nwith E.A.S., refusing numerous offers of advancement. Do I have to tell\nyou what your bugaboo is now?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Anderson hoarsely. \"But I'm ... not afraid of it. I had no\nidea your ...\" He swallowed. \"... information was that complete.\"\n\n\"I wish it wasn't. I wish I had some things to--wonder about,\" said\nParesi with surprising bitterness.\n\n\nThe Captain looked at him shrewdly. \"Go on with your case histories.\"\n\n\"I've finished.\"\n\n\"No you haven't.\" When Paresi did not answer, the Captain nudged him.\n\"Johnny, Ives, Hoskins, me. Haven't you forgotten someone?\"\n\n\"No I haven't,\" snarled Paresi, \"and if you expect me to tell you why a\npsychologist buries himself in the stars, I'm not going to do it.\"\n\n\"I don't want to be told anything so general,\" said the Captain. \"I just\nwant to know why _you_ came out here.\"\n\nParesi scowled. The Captain looked away from him and hazarded, \"Big frog\nin a small pond, Nick?\"\n\nParesi snorted.\n\nAnderson asked, \"Women don't like you, do they, Nick?\"\n\nAlmost inaudibly, Paresi said, \"Better cut it out, skipper.\"\n\nAnderson said, \"Closest thing to being a mother--is that it?\"\n\nParesi went white.\n\nThe Captain closed his eyes, frowned, and at last said, \"Or maybe you\njust want to play God.\"\n\n\"I'm going to make it tough for you,\" said Paresi between his teeth.\n\"There are several ways you can break, just as there are several ways to\nbreak a log--explode it, crush it, saw it, burn it.... One of the ways\nis to fight me until you win. Me, because there's no one else left to\nfight you. So--I won't fight with you. And you're too rational to attack\nme unless I do. _That_ is the thing that will make it tough. If you must\nbreak, it'll have to be some other way.\"\n\n\"Is that what I'm doing?\" the Captain asked with sudden mildness. \"I\ndidn't know that. I thought I was trying to get your own case history\nout of you, that's all. What are you staring at?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\nThere was nothing. Where there had been forward viewports, there was\nnothing. Where there had been controls, the communication station, the\nforward acceleration panels and storage lockers; the charts and\ncomputers and radar gear--there was nothing. Blackness; featureless,\nsilent, impenetrable. They sat on one couch by one wall, to which was\nfixed one table. Around them was empty floor and a blackness. The\nchess-player faced into it, and perhaps he was partly within it; it was\ndifficult to see.\n\nThe Captain and the medical officer stared at one another. There seemed\nto be nothing to say.\n\n\n\n\n                    VI\n\n    _For man's sense is falsely asserted to be the standard of\n    things: on the contrary, all the perceptions, both of the senses\n    and the mind, bear reference to man and not to the universe; and\n    the human mind resembles those uneven mirrors which impart their\n    own properties to different objects ... and distorts and\n    disfigures them ... For every one ... has a cave or den of his\n    own which refracts and discolors the light of nature._\n        --Sir Francis Bacon\n            (1561--1626)\n\n\nIt was the Captain who moved first. He went to the remaining bulkhead,\nspun a dog, and opened a cabinet. From it he took a rack of spare radar\nparts and three thick coils of wire. Paresi, startled, turned and saw\nHoskins peering owlishly at the Captain.\n\nAnderson withdrew some tools, reached far back in the cabinet, and took\nout a large bottle.\n\n\"Oh,\" said Paresi. \"That.... I thought you were doing something\nconstructive.\"\n\nIn the far shadows, Hoskins turned silently back to his game. The\nCaptain gazed down at the bottle, tossed it, caught it. \"I am,\" he said.\n\"I am.\"\n\n\nHe came and sat beside the doctor. He thumbed off the stopper and drank\nferociously. Paresi watched, his eyes as featureless as the imprisoning\ndark.\n\n\"Well?\" said the Captain pugnaciously.\n\nParesi's hands rose and fell, once. \"Just wondering why.\"\n\n\"Why I'm going to get loopin', stoopin' drunk? I'll tell you why,\nhead-shrinker. Because I want to, that's why. Because I like it. I'm\ndoing something I like because I like it. I'm not doing it because of\nthe inversion of this concealed repression as expressed in the involuted\nfeelings my childhood developed in my attitude toward the sex-life of\nbeavers, see, couch-catechizer old boy? I like it and that's why.\"\n\n\"I knew a man who went to bed with old shoes because he liked it,\" said\nParesi coldly.\n\nThe Captain drank again and laughed harshly. \"Nothing can change you,\ncan it, Nick?\"\n\nParesi looked around him almost fearfully. \"I can change,\" he whispered.\n\"Ives is gone. Give me the bottle.\"\n\nSomething clattered to the deck at the hem of the black curtain.\n\n\"'S another hallucination,\" said the Captain. \"Go pick up the\nhallucination, Nicky-boy.\"\n\n\"Not my hallucination,\" said Paresi. \"Pick it up yourself.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said the Captain good-naturedly. He waited while Paresi drank,\ntook back the bottle, tilted it sharply over his mouth. He wiped his\nlips with the back of his hand, exhaled heavily, and went to the\nblackness across the cabin.\n\n\"Well, what do you know,\" he breathed.\n\n\"What is it this time?\"\n\n[Illustration: Spaceman in melting room.]\n\n\nAnderson held the thing up. \"A trophy, that's what.\" He peered at it.\n\"_All-American, 2675._ Little statue of a guy holding up a victory\nwreath. Nice going, little guy.\" He strode to Paresi and snatched away\nthe bottle. He poured liquor on the head of the figurine. \"Have a drink,\nlittle guy.\"\n\n\"Let me see that.\"\n\nParesi took it, held it, turned it over. Suddenly he dropped it as if it\nwere a red-hot coal. \"Oh, dear God....\"\n\n\"'Smatter, Nick?\" The Captain picked up the statuette and peered at it.\n\n\"Put it down, put it down,\" said the doctor in a choked voice.\n\"It's--Johnny....\"\n\n\"Oh it is, it is,\" breathed the Captain. He put down the statuette\ngingerly on the table, hesitated, then turned its face away from them.\nWith abrupt animation he swung to Paresi. \"Hey! You didn't say it looked\nlike Johnny. You said it _was_ Johnny!\"\n\n\"Did I?\"\n\n\"Yup.\" He grinned wolfishly. \"Not bad for a psychologist. What a\npeephole you opened up! Graven images, huh?\"\n\n\"Shut up, Anderson,\" said Paresi tiredly. \"I told you I'm not going to\nlet you needle me.\"\n\n\"Aw now, it's all in fun,\" said the Captain. He plumped down and threw a\nheavy arm across Anderson's shoulders. \"Le's be friends. Le's sing a\nsong.\"\n\nParesi shoved him away. \"Leave me alone. Leave me alone.\"\n\nAnderson turned away from him and regarded the statuette gravely. He\nextended the bottle toward it, muttered a greeting, and drank. \"I\nwonder....\"\n\nThe words hung there until Paresi twisted up out of his forlorn reverie\nto bat them down. \"Damn it--_what_ do you wonder?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said the Captain jovially, \"I was just wondering what you'll be.\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\"\n\nAnderson waved the bottle at the figurine, which called it to his\nattention again, and so again he drank. \"Johnny turned into what he\nthinks he is. A little guy with a big victory. Hoskins, there, he's\ngoing to be a slide-rule, jus' you wait and see. Ol' Ives, that's easy.\nHe's goin' to be a beer barrel, with beer in it. Always did have a head\non him, Ives did.\" He stopped to laugh immoderately at Paresi's\ndarkening face. \"Me, I have no secrets no more. I'm going to be a coat\nof arms--a useless philosophy rampant on a field of stars.\" He put the\nopen mouth of the bottle against his forehead and pressed it violently,\nlowered it and touched the angry red ring it left between his eyes.\n\"Mark of the beast,\" he confided. \"Caste mark. Zero, that's me and my\nwhole damn family. The die is cast, the caste has died.\" He grunted\nappreciatively and turned again to Paresi. \"But what's old Nicky going\nto be?\"\n\n\"Don't call me Nicky,\" said the doctor testily.\n\n\"I know,\" said the Captain, narrowing his eyes and laying one finger\nalongside his nose. \"A reference book, tha's what you'll be. A treatise\non the ... the post-nasal hysterectomy, or how to unbutton a man's\nprejudices and take down his pride.... I swiped all that from\nsomewhere....\n\n\"No!\" he shouted suddenly; then, with conspiratorial quiet, he said,\n\"You won't be no book, Nicky boy. Covers aren't hard enough. Not the\nright type face. Get it?\" he roared, and dug Paresi viciously in the\nribs. \"Type face, it's a witticism.\"\n\nParesi bent away from the blow like a caterpillar being bitten by a\nfire-ant. He said nothing.\n\n\"And finally,\" said the Captain, \"you won't be a book because you got\n... no ... spine.\" He leapt abruptly to his feet. \"Well, what do you\nknow!\"\n\n\nHe bent and scooped up an unaccountable object that rested by the\nnearest shadows. It was a quarter-keg of beer.\n\nHe hefted it and thumped it heavily down on the table. \"Come on, Nick,\"\nhe chortled. \"Gather ye round. Here's old Ives, like I said.\"\n\nParesi stared at the keg, his eyes stretched so wide open that the lids\nmoved visibly with his pulse. \"Stop it, Anderson, you swine....\"\n\nThe Captain tossed him a disgusted glance and a matching snort. From the\nclutter of radar gear he pulled a screwdriver and a massive little\nstep-down transformer down on its handle. The bung disappeared\nexplosively inside the keg, and was replaced by a gout of white foam.\nParesi shrieked.\n\n\"Ah, shaddup,\" growled Anderson. He rummaged until he found a\ntube-shield. He stripped off a small length of self-welding metal tape\nand clapped it over the terminal-hole at the closed end of the shield,\nmaking it into an adequate mug. He waited a moment while the weld\ncooled, then tipped the keg until solid beer began to run with the foam.\nHe filled the improvised mug and extended it toward Paresi.\n\n\"Good ol' Ives,\" he said sentimentally. \"Come on, Paresi. Have a drink\non Ives.\"\n\nParesi turned and covered his face like a frightened woman.\n\nAnderson shrugged and drank the beer. \"It's good beer,\" he said. He\nglanced down at the doctor, who suddenly flung himself face down across\nthe couch with his head hanging out of sight on the opposite side, from\nwhich came the sounds of heaving and choking.\n\n\"Poor ol' Nick,\" said the Captain sadly. He refilled the mug and sat\ndown. With his free hand he patted Paresi's back. \"Can't take it. Poor,\npoor ol' Nick....\"\n\n\nAfter that there was a deepening silence, a deepening blackness. Paresi\nwas quiet now, breathing very slowly, holding each breath, expelling air\nand lying quiet for three full seconds before each inhalation, as if\nbreathing were a conscious effort--more; as if breathing were the whole\ntask, the entire end of existence. Anderson slumped lower and lower.\nEach time he blinked his lids opened a fraction less, while the time his\neyes stayed closed became a fraction of a second longer. The cabin\nwaited as tensely as the taut pose of the rigid little victory trophy.\n\nThen there was the music.\n\nIt was soft, grand music; the music of pageantry, cloth-of-gold and\nscarlet vestments; pendant jewels and multicolored dimness shouldering\nupward to be lost in vaulted stone. It was music which awaited the\naccompaniment of whispers, thousands of awed, ritualistic sibilants\nwhich would carry no knowable meaning and only one avowed purpose. Soft\nmusic, soft, soft; not soft as to volume, for the volume grew and grew,\nbut soft with the softness of clouds which are soft for all their\nmountain-size and brilliance; soft and living as a tiger's throat, soft\nas a breast, soft as the act of drowning, and huge as a cloud.\n\nAnderson made two moves: he raised his head, and he spun the beer in his\nmug so its center surface sank and the bubbles whirled. With his head up\nand his eyes down he sat watching the bubbles circle and slow.\n\nParesi rose slowly and went to the center of the small lighted space\nleft to them, and slowly he knelt. His arms came up and out, and his\nupturned face was twisted and radiant.\n\nBefore him in the blackness there was--or perhaps there had been for\nsome time--a blue glow, almost as lightless as the surrounding dark, but\nblue and physically deep for all that. Its depth increased rather than\nits light. It became the ghost of a grotto, the mouth of a nameless\nPlace.\n\nAnd in it was a person. A ... _presence_. It beckoned.\n\nParesi's face gleamed wetly. \"Me?\" he breathed. \"You want--me?\"\n\nIt beckoned.\n\n\"I--don't believe you,\" said Paresi. \"You can't want me. You don't know\nwho I am. You don't know what I am, what I've done. You don't want\nme....\" His voice quavered almost to inaudibility. \"... do you?\"\n\nIt beckoned.\n\n\"Then you know,\" sang Paresi in the voice of revelation. \"I have denied\nyou with my lips, but you know, you know, you know that underneath ...\ndeep down ... I have not wavered for an instant. I have kept your image\nbefore me.\"\n\nHe rose. Now Anderson watched him.\n\n\"You are my life,\" said Paresi, \"my hopes, my fulfillment. You are all\nwisdom and all charity. Thank you, thank you ... Master. I give thee\nthanks oh Lord,\" he blurted, and walked straight into the blue glow.\n\nThere was an instant when the music was an anthem, and then it too was\ngone.\n\n\nAnderson's breath whistled out. He lifted his beer, checked himself,\nthen set it down gently by the figurine of the athlete. He went to the\nplace where Paresi had disappeared, bent and picked up a small object.\nHe swore, and came back to the couch.\n\nHe sucked his thumb and swore again. \"Your thorns are sharp, Paresi.\"\n\nCarefully he placed the object between the beer keg and the statuette.\nIt was a simple wooden cross. Around the arms and shaft, twisted tightly\nand biting deeply into the wood, was a thorny withe. \"God all mighty,\nNick,\" Anderson said mournfully, \"you didn't have to hide it. Nobody'd\nhave minded.\"\n\n\"Well?\" he roared suddenly at the blackness, \"what are you waiting for?\nAm I in your way? Have I done anything to stop you? Come on, come on!\"\n\nHis voice rebounded from the remaining bulkhead, but was noticeably\nswallowed up in the absorbent blackness. He waited until its last\nreverberations had died, and then until its memory was hard to fix. He\npounded futilely at the couch cushions, glared all about in a swift,\nintense, animal way. Then he relaxed, bent down and fumbled for the\nalcohol bottle. \"What's the matter with you, out there?\" he demanded\nquietly. \"You waiting for me to sober up? You want me to be myself\nbefore you fix me up? You want to know something? _In vino veritas_,\nthat's what. You don't have to wait for me, kiddies. I'm a hell of a lot\nmore me right now than I will be after I get over this.\" He took the\nfigurine and replaced it on the other side of the keg. \"Tha's right,\nJohnny. Get over on the other side of ol' Beer-belly there. Make room\nfor the old man.\" To the blackness he said, \"Look, I got neat habits,\ndon't leave me on no deck, hear? Rack me up alongside the boys. What is\nit I'm going to be? Oh yeah. A coat of arms. Hey, I forgot the motto.\nAll righty: this is my motto. '_Sic itur ad astra_'--that is to say,\n'This is the way to the men's room.'\"\n\nSomewhere a baby cried.\n\nAnderson threw his forearm over his eyes.\n\nSomeone went \"Shh!\" but the baby went right on crying.\n\nAnderson said, \"Who's there?\"\n\n\"Just me, darling.\"\n\nHe breathed deeply, twice, and then whispered, \"Louise?\"\n\n\"Of course. _Shh_, Jeannie!\"\n\n\"Jeannie's with you, Louise? She's all right? You're--all right?\"\n\n\"Come and see,\" the sweet voice chuckled.\n\nCaptain Anderson dove into the blackness aft. It closed over him\nsilently and completely.\n\nOn the table stood an ivory figurine, a quarter-keg of beer, a thorny\ncross, and a heart. It wasn't a physiological specimen; rather it was\nthe archetype of the most sentimental of symbols, the balanced,\ncushiony, brilliant red valentine heart. Through it was a golden arrow,\nand on it lay cut flowers: lilies, white roses, and forget-me-nots. The\nheart pulsed strongly; and though it pumped no blood, at least it showed\nthat it was alive, which made it, perhaps, a better thing than it looked\nat first glance.\n\nNow it was very quiet in the ship, and very dark.\n\n\n\n\n                    VII\n\n    _... We are about to land. The planet is green and blue below\n    us, and the long trip is over.... It looks as if it might be a\n    pleasant place to live...._\n\n    _A fragment of Old Testament verse has been running through my\n    mind--from Ecclesiastes, I think. I don't remember it verbatim,\n    but it's something like this:_\n\n    _To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose\n    under heaven: A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to\n    mourn, and a time to dance; A time to get, and a time to lose; a\n    time to keep, and a time to cast away; A time to be born, and a\n    time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which\n    is planted._\n\n    _For me, anyway, I feel that the time has come. Perhaps it is\n    not to die but something else, less final or more terrible._\n\n    _In any case, you will remember, I know, what we decided long\n    ago--that a man owes one of two things to his planet, to his\n    race: posterity, or himself. I could not contribute the\n    first--it is only proper that I should offer the second and not\n    shrink if it is accepted...._\n        --From a letter by Peter Hoskins to his wife.\n\n\nIn the quiet and the dark, Hoskins moved.\n\n\"Checkmate,\" he said.\n\nHe rose from his chair and crossed the cabin. Ignoring what was on the\ntable, he opened a drawer under the parts cabinet and took out a steel\nrule. From a book rack he lifted down a heavy manual. He sat on the end\nof the couch with the manual on his knees and leafed through it,\nsmoothing it open at a page of physical measurements. He glanced at the\nfloor, across it to the black curtain, back to the one exposed bulkhead.\nHe grunted, put the book down, and carried his tape to the steel wall.\nHe anchored one end of it there by flipping the paramagnetic control on\nthe tape case, and pulled the tape across the room. At the blackness he\ntook a reading, made a mark.\n\nThen he took a fore-and-aft measurement from a point opposite the\nforward end of the table to one opposite the after end of the bunk.\nWorking carefully, he knelt and constructed a perpendicular to this\nline. He put the tape down for the third time, arriving again at the\noutboard wall of darkness. He stood regarding it thoughtfully, and then\nunhesitatingly plunged his arm into it. He fumbled for a moment, moving\nhis hand around in a circle, pressing forward, trying again. Suddenly\nthere was a click, a faint hum. He stepped back.\n\nSomething huge shouldered out of the dark. It pressed forward toward\nhim, passed him, stopped moving.\n\nIt was the port.\n\nHoskins wiped sweat away from his upper lip and stood blinking into the\nairlock until the outer port opened as well. Warm afternoon sunlight and\na soft, fresh breeze poured in. In the wind was birdsong and the smell\nof growing things. Hoskins gazed into it, his mild eyes misty. Then he\nturned back to the cabin.\n\nThe darkness was gone. Ives was sprawled on the after couch, apparently\nunconscious. Johnny was smiling in his sleep. The Captain was snoring\nstertorously, and Paresi was curled up like a cat on the floor. The\nsunlight streamed in through the forward viewports. The manual wheel\ngleamed on the bulkhead, unbroken.\n\n\nHoskins looked at the sleeping crew and shook his head, half-smiling.\nThen he stepped to the control console and lifted a microphone from its\nhook. He began to speak softly into it in his gentle, unimpressive\nvoice. He said:\n\n\"Reality is what it is, and not what it seems to be. What it seems to be\nis an individual matter, and even in the individual it varies\nconstantly. If that's a truism, it's still the truth, as true as the\nfact that this ship cannot fail. The course of events after our landing\nwould have been profoundly different if we had unanimously accepted the\nthing we knew to be true. But none of us need feel guilty on that score.\nWe are not conditioned to deny the evidence of our senses.\n\n\"What the natives of this planet have done is, at base, simple and\nstraightforward. They had to know if the race who built this ship could\ndo so because they were psychologically sound (and therefore capable of\nreasoning out the building process, among many, many other things) or\nwhether we were merely mechanically apt. To find this out, they tested\nus. They tested us the way we test steel--to find out its breaking\npoint. And while they were playing a game for our sanity, I played a\ngame for our lives. I could not share it with any of you because it was\na game only I, of us all, have experience in. Paresi was right to a\ncertain degree when he said I had retreated into abstraction--the\nabstraction of chess. He was wrong, though, when he concluded I had been\ndriven to it. You can be quite sure that I did it by choice. It was\nsimply a matter of translating the contactual evidence into an\nequivalent idea-system.\n\n\"I learned very rapidly that when they play a game, they abide by the\nrules. I know the rules of chess, but I did not know the rules of their\ngame. They did not give me their rules. They simply permitted me to\nconvey mine to them.\n\n\"I learned a little more slowly that, though their power to reach our\nminds is unheard-of in any of the seven galaxies we know about, it still\ncannot take and use any but the ideas in the forefront of our\nconsciousness. In other words, chess was a possibility. They could be\nforced to take a sacrificed piece, as well as being forced to lose one\nof their own. They extrapolate a sequence beautifully--but they can be\nout-thought. So much for that: I beat them at chess. And by confining my\nefforts to the chessboard, where I knew the rules and where they\nrespected them, I was able to keep what we call sanity. Where you were\ndisturbed because the port disappeared, I was not disturbed because the\ndisappearance was not chess.\n\n\"You're wondering, of course, how they did what they did to us. I don't\nknow. But I can tell you what they did. They empathize--that is, see\nthrough our eyes, feel with our fingertips--so that they perceive what\nwe do. Second, they can control those perceptions; hang on a distortion\ncircuit, as Ives would put it, between the sense organ and the brain.\nFor example, you'll find all our fingerprints all around the port\ncontrol, where, one after the other, we punched the wall and thought we\nwere punching the button.\n\n\"You're wondering, too, what I did to break their hold on us. Well, I\nsimply believed what I knew to be the truth; that the ship is unharmed\nand unchanged. I measured it with a steel tape and it was so. Why didn't\nthey force me to misread the tape? They would have, if I'd done that\nmeasuring first. At the start they were in the business of turning every\npiece of pragmatic evidence into an outright lie. But I outlasted the\ntest. When they'd finished with their whole arsenal of sensory lies,\nthey still hadn't broken me. They then turned me loose, like a rat in a\nmaze, to see if I could find the way out. And again they abided by their\nrules. They didn't change the maze when at last I attacked it.\n\n\"Let me rephrase what I've done; I feel uncomfortable cast as a\nsuperman. We five pedestrians faced some heavy traffic on a surface\nroad. You four tried nobly to cross--deaf and blindfolded. You were all\ncasualties. I was not; and it wasn't because I am stronger or wiser than\nyou, but only because I stayed on the sidewalk and waited for the light\nto change....\n\n\"So we won. Now ...\"\n\n\nHoskins paused to wet his lips. He looked at his shipmates, each in\nturn, each for a long, reflective moment. Again his gentle face showed\nthe half-smile, the small shake of the head. He lifted the mike.\n\n\"... In my chess game I offered them a minor piece in order to achieve\na victory, and they accepted. My interpretation is that they want _me_\nfor further tests. This need not concern you on either of the scores\nwhich occur to you as you hear this. First: The choice is my own. It is\nnot a difficult one to make. As Paresi once pointed out, I have a high\nidealistic quotient. Second: I am, after all, a very minor piece and the\ngame is a great one. I am convinced that there is no test to which they\ncan now subject me, and break me, that any one of you cannot pass.\n\n\"But you must in no case come tearing after me in a wild and thoughtless\nrescue attempt. I neither want that nor need it. And do not judge the\nnatives severely; we are in no position to do so. I am certain now that\nwhether I come back or not, these people will make a valuable addition\nto the galactic community.\n\n\"Good luck, in any case. If the tests shouldn't prove too arduous, I'll\nsee you again. If not, my only regret is that I shall break up what has\nturned out to be, after all, a very effective team. If this happens,\ntell my wife the usual things and deliver to her a letter you will find\namong my papers. She was long ago reconciled to eventualities.\n\n\"Johnny ... the natives will fix your lighter....\n\n\"Good luck, good-bye.\"\n\nHoskins hung up the microphone. He took a stylus and wrote a line:\n\"_Hear my recording. Pete._\"\n\nAnd then, bareheaded and unarmed, he stepped through the port, out into\nthe golden sunshine. Outside he stopped, and for a moment touched his\ncheek to the flawless surface of the hull.\n\nHe walked down into the valley.\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK BREAKING POINT***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 21988-8.txt or 21988-8.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/1/9/8/21988\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
