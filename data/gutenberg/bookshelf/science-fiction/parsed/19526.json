Tumbling out of the gleaming\nmonorail cars, they froze to quick attention, their eyes turned to the\nmain exit ramp.\n\nThey saw a short, squat, heavily built man, wearing the scarlet uniform\nof the enlisted Solar Guard, staring down at them, his fists jammed into\nhis hips and his feet spread wide apart. He stood there a moment, his\nsharp eyes flicking over the silent clusters, then slowly sauntered down\nthe ramp toward them with a strangely light, catfooted tread.\n\n\"Form up! Column of fours!\"\n\nAlmost before the echoes of the thunderous voice died down, the\nscattered groups of boys had formed themselves into four ragged lines\nalong the platform.\n\nThe scarlet-clad figure stood before them, his seamed and weather-beaten\nface set in stern lines. But there was a glint of laughter in his eyes\nas he noticed the grotesque and sometimes tortuous positions of some of\nthe boys as they braced themselves in what they considered a military\npose.\n\nEvery year, for the last ten years, he had met the trains at the\nmonorail station. Every year, he had seen boys in their late teens,\ngathered from Earth, Mars and Venus, three planets millions of miles\napart. They were dressed in many different styles of clothes; the loose\nflowing robes of the lads from the Martian deserts; the knee-length\nshorts and high stockings of the boys from the Venusian jungles; the\nvari-colored jacket and trouser combinations of the boys from the\nmagnificent Earth cities. But they all had one thing in common--a dream.\nAll had visions of becoming Space Cadets, and later, officers in the\nSolar Guard. Each dreamed of the day when he would command rocket ships\nthat patrolled the space lanes from the outer edges of Pluto to the\ntwilight zone of Mercury. They were all the same.\n\n\"All right now! Let's get squared away!\" His voice was a little more\nfriendly now. \"My name's McKenny--Mike McKenny. Warrant Officer--Solar\nGuard. See these hash marks?\"\n\nHe suddenly held out a thick arm that bulged against the tight red\nsleeve. From the wrists to the elbow, the lines of boys could see a\nsolid corrugation of white V-shaped stripes.\n\n\"Each one of these marks represents four years in space,\" he continued.\n\"There's ten marks here and I intend making it an even dozen! And no\nbunch of Earthworms is going to make me lose the chance to get those\nlast two by trying to make a space monkey out of me!\"\n\nMcKenny sauntered along the line of boys with that same strange catlike\nstep and looked squarely into the eyes of each boy in turn.\n\n\"Just to keep the record straight, I'm your cadet supervisor. I handle\nyou until you either wash out and go home, or you finally blast off and\nbecome spacemen. If you stub your toe or cut your finger, come to me. If\nyou get homesick, come to me. And if you get into trouble\"--he paused\nmomentarily--\"don't bother because I'll be looking for _you_, with a\nfist full of demerits!\"\n\nMcKenny continued his slow inspection of the ranks, then suddenly\nstopped short. At the far end of the line, a tall, ruggedly built boy of\nabout eighteen, with curly brown hair and a pleasant, open face, was\nstirring uncomfortably. He slowly reached down toward his right boot and\nheld it, while he wriggled his foot into it. McKenny quickly strode over\nand planted himself firmly in front of the boy.\n\n\"When I say stand to, I mean stand to!\" he roared.\n\nThe boy jerked himself erect and snapped to attention.\n\n\"I--I'm sorry, sir,\" he stammered. \"But my boot--it was coming off\nand--\"\n\n\"I don't care if your pants are falling down, an order's an order!\"\n\nThe boy gulped and reddened as a nervous titter rippled through the\nranks. McKenny spun around and glared. There was immediate silence.\n\n\"What's your name?\" He turned back to the boy.\n\n\"Corbett, sir. Cadet Candidate Tom Corbett,\" answered the boy.\n\n\"Wanta be a spaceman, do ya?\" asked Mike, pushing his jaw out another\ninch.\n\n\"Yes, sir!\"\n\n\"Been studying long hard hours in primary school, eh? Talked your mother\nand father deaf in the ears to let you come to Space Academy and be a\nspaceman! You want to feel those rockets bucking in your back out in the\nstars? _EH?_\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Tom, wondering how this man he didn't even know\ncould know so much about him.\n\n\"_Well, you won't make it_ if I ever catch you disobeying orders again!\"\n\nMcKenny turned quickly to see what effect he had created on the others.\nThe lines of bewildered faces satisfied him that his old trick of using\none of the cadets as an example was a success. He turned back to\nCorbett.\n\n\"The only reason I'm not logging you now is because you're not a Space\nCadet yet--and won't be, until you've taken the Academy oath!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\"\n\nMcKenny walked down the line and across the platform to an open\nteleceiver booth. The ranks were quiet and motionless, and as he made\nhis call, McKenny smiled. Finally, when the tension seemed unbearable,\nhe roared, \"At ease!\" and closed the door of the booth.\n\nThe ranks melted immediately and the boys fell into chattering clusters,\ntheir voices low, and they occasionally peered over their shoulders at\nCorbett as if he had suddenly been stricken with a horrible plague.\n\nBrooding over the seeming ill-fortune that had called McKenny's\nattention to him at the wrong time, Tom sat down on his suitcase to\nadjust his boot. He shook his head slowly. He had heard Space Academy\nwas tough, tougher than any other school in the world, but he didn't\nexpect the stern discipline to begin so soon.\n\n\"This could be the beginning of the end,\" drawled a lazy voice in back\nof Tom, \"for some of the more enthusiastic cadets.\" Someone laughed.\n\nTom turned to see a boy about his own age, weight and height, with\nclose-cropped blond hair that stood up brushlike all over his head. He\nwas lounging idly against a pillar, luggage piled high around his feet.\nTom recognized him immediately as Roger Manning, and his pleasant\nfeatures twisted into a scowl.\n\n\"About what I'd expect from that character,\" he thought, \"after the\ntrick he pulled on Astro, that big fellow from Venus.\"\n\nTom's thoughts were of the night before, when the connecting links of\ntransportation from all over the Solar Alliance had deposited the boys\nin the Central Station at Atom City where they were to board the\nmonorail express for the final lap to Space Academy.\n\nManning, as Tom remembered it, had taken advantage of the huge Venusian\nby tricking him into carrying his luggage. Reasoning that since the\ngravity of Venus was considerably less than that of Earth, he convinced\nAstro that he needed the extra weight to maintain his balance. It had\nbeen a cheap trick, but no one had wanted to challenge the sharpness of\nManning's tongue and come to Astro's rescue. Tom had wanted to, but\nrefrained when he saw that Astro didn't mind.\n\nFinishing his conversation on the teleceiver, McKenny stepped out of the\nbooth and faced the boys again.\n\n\"All right,\" he bawled. \"They're all set for you at the Academy! Pick up\nyour gear and follow me!\" With a quick light step, he hopped on the\nrolling slidewalk at the edge of the platform and started moving away.\n\n\"Hey, Astro!\" Roger Manning stopped the huge boy about to step over.\n\"Going to carry my bags?\"\n\nThe Venusian, a full head taller, hesitated and looked doubtfully at the\nfour suitcases at Roger's feet.\n\n\"Come on,\" prodded Roger in a tone of mock good nature. \"The gravity\naround here is the same as in Atom City. It's the same all over the face\nof the Earth. Wouldn't want you to just fly away.\" He snickered and\nlooked around, winking broadly.\n\nAstro still hesitated, \"I don't know, Manning. I--uhh--\"\n\n\"By the rings of Saturn! What's going on here?\" Suddenly from outside\nthe ring of boys that had gathered around, McKenny came roaring in,\nbulling his way to the center of the group to face Roger and Astro.\n\n\"I have a strained wrist, sir,\" began Roger smoothly.\n\n\"And this cadet candidate\"--he nodded casually toward Astro--\"offered to\ncarry my luggage. Now he refuses.\"\n\nMike glared at Astro. \"Did you agree to carry this man's luggage?\"\n\n\"Well--I--ah--\" fumbled Astro.\n\n\"Well? Did you or didn't you?\"\n\n\"I guess I sorta did, sir,\" replied Astro, his face turning a slow red.\n\n\"I don't hold with anyone doing another man's work, but if a Solar Guard\nofficer, a Space Cadet, or even a cadet candidate gives his word he'll\ndo something, he does it!\" McKenny shook a finger in Astro's face,\nreaching up to do it. \"Is that clear?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" was the embarrassed reply.\n\nMcKenny turned to Manning who stood listening, a faint smile playing on\nhis lips.\n\n\"What's your name, Mister?\"\n\n\"Manning. Roger Manning,\" he answered easily.\n\n\"So you've got a strained wrist, have you?\" asked Mike mockingly while\nsending a sweeping glance from top to bottom of the gaudy colored\nclothes.\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Can't carry your own luggage, eh?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Roger evenly. \"I could carry my own luggage. I thought\nthe candidate from Venus might give me a helping hand. Nothing more. I\ncertainly didn't intend for him to become a marked man for a simple\ngesture of comradeship.\" He glanced past McKenny toward the other boys\nand added softly, \"And comradeship _is_ the spirit of Space Academy,\nisn't it, sir?\"\n\nHis face suddenly crimson, McKenny spluttered, searching for a ready\nanswer, then turned away abruptly.\n\n\"What are you all standing around for?\" he roared. \"Get your gear and\nyourselves over on that slidewalk! Blast!\" He turned once again to the\nrolling platform. Manning smiled at Astro and hopped nimbly onto the\nslidewalk after McKenny, leaving his luggage in a heap in front of\nAstro.\n\n\"And be careful with that small case, Astro,\" he called as he drifted\naway.\n\n\"Here, Astro,\" said Tom. \"I'll give you a hand.\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" replied Astro grimly. \"I can carry 'em.\"\n\n\"No, let me help.\" Tom bent over--then suddenly straightened. \"By the\nway, we haven't introduced ourselves. My name's Corbett--Tom Corbett.\"\nHe stuck out his hand. Astro hesitated, sizing up the curly-headed boy\nin front of him, who stood smiling and offering friendship. Finally he\npushed out his own hand and smiled back at Tom.\n\n\"Astro, but you know that by now.\"\n\n\"That sure was a dirty deal Manning gave you.\"\n\n\"Ah, I don't mind carrying his bags. It's just that I wanted to tell him\nhe's going to have to send it all back. They don't allow a candidate to\nkeep more than a toothbrush at the Academy.\"\n\n\"Guess he'll find out the hard way.\"\n\nCarrying Manning's luggage as well as their own, they finally stepped on\nthe slidewalk and began the smooth easy ride from the monorail station\nto the Academy. Both having felt the sharpness of Manning's tongue, and\nboth having been dressed down by Warrant Officer McKenny, they seemed to\nbe linked by a bond of trouble and they stood close together for mutual\ncomfort.\n\nAs the slidewalk whisked them silently past the few remaining buildings\nand credit exchanges that nestled around the monorail station, Tom gave\nthought to his new life.\n\nEver since Jon Builker, the space explorer, returning from the first\nsuccessful flight to a distant galaxy, came through his home town near\nNew Chicago twelve years before, Tom had wanted to be a spaceman.\nThrough high school and the New Chicago Primary Space School where he\nhad taken his first flight above Earth's atmosphere, he had waited for\nthe day when he would pass his entrance exams and be accepted as a cadet\ncandidate in Space Academy. For no reason at all, a lump rose in his\nthroat, as the slidewalk rounded a curve and he saw for the first time,\nthe gleaming white magnificence of the Tower of Galileo. He recognized\nit immediately from the hundreds of books he had read about the Academy\nand stared wordlessly.\n\n\"Sure is pretty, isn't it?\" asked Astro, his voice strangely husky.\n\n\"Yeah,\" breathed Tom in reply. \"It sure is.\" He could only stare at the\nshimmering tower ahead.\n\n\"It's all I've ever wanted to do,\" said Tom at length. \"Just get out\nthere and--be _free_!\"\n\n\"I know what you mean. It's the greatest feeling in the world.\"\n\n\"You say that as if you've already been up there.\"\n\nAstro grinned. \"Yup. Used to be an enlisted space sailor. Bucked rockets\nin an old freighter on the Luna City--Venusport run.\"\n\n\"Well, what are you doing here?\" Tom was amazed and impressed.\n\n\"Simple. I want to be an officer. I want to get into the Solar Guard and\nhandle the power-push in one of those cruisers.\"\n\nTom's eyes glowed with renewed admiration for his new friend. \"I've been\nout four or five times but only in jet boats five hundred miles out.\nNothing like a jump to Luna City or Venusport.\"\n\nBy now the slidewalk had carried them past the base of the Tower of\nGalileo to a large building facing the Academy quadrangle and the spell\nwas broken by McKenny's bull-throated roar.\n\n\"Haul off, you blasted polliwogs!\"\n\nAs the boys jumped off the slidewalk, a cadet, dressed in the vivid blue\nthat Tom recognized as the official dress of the Senior Cadet Corps,\nwalked up to McKenny and spoke to him quietly. The warrant officer\nturned back to the waiting group and gave rapid orders.\n\n\"By twos, follow Cadet Herbert inside and he'll assign you to your\nquarters. Shower, shave if you have to and can find anything to shave,\nand dress in the uniform that'll be supplied you. Be ready to take the\nAcademy oath at\"--he paused and glanced at the senior cadet who held up\nthree fingers--\"fifteen hundred hours. That's three o'clock. All clear?\nBlast off!\"\n\nJust as the boys began to move, there was a sudden blasting roar in the\ndistance. The noise expanded and rolled across the hills surrounding\nSpace Academy. It thundered over the grassy quadrangle, vibrating waves\nof sound one on top of the other, until the very air quivered under the\nimpact.\n\nMouths open, eyes popping, the cadet candidates stood rooted in their\ntracks and stared as, in the distance, a long, thin, needlelike ship\nseemed to balance delicately on a column of flame, then suddenly shoot\nskyward and disappear.\n\n\"Pull in your eyeballs!\" McKenny's voice crackled over the receding\nthunder. \"You'll fly one of those firecrackers some day. But right now\nyou're _Earthworms_, the lowest form of animal life in the Academy!\"\n\nAs the boys snapped to attention again, Tom thought he caught a faint\nsmile on Cadet Herbert's face as he stood to one side waiting for\nMcKenny to finish his tirade. Suddenly he snapped his back straight,\nturned sharply and stepped through the wide doors of the building.\nQuickly the double line of boys followed.\n\n\"Did you see that, Astro?\" asked Tom excitedly. \"That was a Solar Guard\npatrol ship!\"\n\n\"Yeah, I know,\" replied Astro. The big candidate from Venus scratched\nhis chin and eyed Tom bashfully. \"Say, Tom--ah, since we sort of know\neach other, how about us trying to get in the same quarters?\"\n\n\"O.K. by me, Astro, if we can,\" said Tom, grinning back at his friend.\n\nThe line pressed forward to Cadet Herbert, who was now waiting at the\nbottom of the slidestairs, a mesh belt that spiraled upward in a narrow\nwell to the upper stories of the building. Speaking into an\naudioscriber, a machine that transmitted his spoken words into\ntypescript, he repeated the names of the candidates as they passed.\n\n\"Cadet Candidate Tom Corbett,\" announced Tom, and Herbert repeated it\ninto the audioscriber.\n\n\"Cadet Candidate Astro!\" The big Venusian stepped forward.\n\n\"What's the rest of it, Mister?\" inquired Herbert.\n\n\"That's all. Just Astro.\"\n\n\"No other names?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" replied Astro. \"You see--\"\n\n\"You don't say 'sir' to a senior cadet, Mister. And we're not interested\nin why you have only one name!\" Herbert snapped.\n\n\"Yes, sir--uhh--Mister.\" Astro flushed and joined Tom.\n\n\"Cadet Candidate Philip Morgan,\" announced the next boy.\n\nHerbert repeated the name into the machine, then announced, \"Cadet\nCandidates Tom Corbett, Astro, and Philip Morgan assigned to Section\n42-D.\"\n\nTurning to the three boys, he indicated the spiraling slidestairs.\n\"Forty-second floor. You'll find Section D in the starboard wing.\"\n\nAstro and Tom immediately began to pile Manning's luggage to one side of\nthe slidestairs.\n\n\"Take your luggage with you, Misters!\" snapped Herbert.\n\n\"It isn't ours,\" replied Tom.\n\n\"Isn't yours?\" Herbert glanced over the pile of suitcases and turned\nback to Tom. \"Whose is it then?\"\n\n\"Belongs to Cadet Candidate Roger Manning,\" replied Tom.\n\n\"What are you doing with it?\"\n\n\"We were carrying it for him.\"\n\n\"Do we have a candidate in the group who finds it necessary to provide\nhimself with valet service?\"\n\nHerbert moved along the line of boys.\n\n\"Will Cadet Candidate Roger Manning please step forward?\"\n\nRoger slid from behind a group of boys to face the senior cadet's cold\nstare.\n\n\"Roger Manning here,\" he presented himself smoothly.\n\n\"Is that your luggage?\" Herbert jerked his thumb over his shoulder.\n\n\"It is.\"\n\nRoger smiled confidently, but Herbert merely stared coldly.\n\n\"You have a peculiar attitude for a candidate, Manning.\"\n\n\"Is there a prescribed attitude, Mr. Herbert?\" Roger asked, his smile\nbroadening. \"If there is, I'll be only too glad to conform to it.\"\n\nHerbert's face twitched almost imperceptibly. Then he nodded, made a\nnotation on a pad and returned to his post at the head of the gaping\nline of boys. \"From now on, Candidate Manning, you will be responsible\nfor your own belongings.\"\n\nTom, Astro, and Philip Morgan stepped on the slidestairs and began\ntheir spiraling ascent to the forty-second floor.\n\n\"I saw what happened at the monorail station,\" drawled the third member\nof Section 42-D, leaning against the bannister of the moving belt. \"By\nthe craters of Luna, that Manning felluh sure is a hot operator.\"\n\n\"We found out for ourselves,\" grunted Astro.\n\n\"Say, since we're all bunkin' togethuh, let's get to knowin' each othuh.\nMy name's Phil Morgan, come from Georgia. Where you all from?\"\n\n\"New Chicago,\" replied Tom. \"Name's Tom Corbett. And this is Astro.\"\n\n\"Hiya.\" Astro stuck out a big paw and grinned his wide grin. \"I guess\nyou heard. Astro's all the name I've got.\"\n\n\"How come?\" inquired the Southerner.\n\n\"I'm from Venus and it's a custom from way back when Venus was first\ncolonized to just hand out one name.\"\n\n\"Funny custom,\" drawled Phil.\n\nAstro started to say something and then stopped, clamping his lips\ntogether. Tom could see his face turn a slow pink. Phil saw it too, and\nhastily added:\n\n\"Oh--I didn't mean anything. I--ah--\" he broke off, embarrassed.\n\n\"Forget it, Phil.\" Astro grinned again.\n\n\"Say,\" interjected Tom. \"Look at that!\"\n\nThey all turned to look at the floor they were passing. Near the edge of\nthe step-off platform on the fourth floor was an oaken panel, inscribed\nwith silver lettering in relief. As they drew even with the plaque, they\ncaught sight of someone behind them. They turned to see Manning, the\npile of suitcases in front of him, reading aloud.\n\n\" ... to the brave men who sacrificed their lives in the conquest of\nspace, this Galaxy Hall is dedicated....\"\n\n\"Say, this must be the museum,\" said Tom. \"Here's where they have all\nthe original gear used in the first space hops.\"\n\n\"Absolutely right,\" said Manning with a smile.\n\n\"I wonder if we could get off and take a look?\" Astro asked.\n\n\"Sure you can,\" said Roger. \"In fact, the Academy regs say every cadet\nmust inspect the exhibits in the space museum within the first week.\"\n\nThe members of Section 42-D looked at Roger questioningly.\n\n\"I don't know if we have time.\" Tom was dubious.\n\n\"Sure you have--plenty. I'd hop off and take a look myself but I've got\nto get this junk ready to ship home.\" He indicated the pile of bags in\nfront of him.\n\n\"Aw, come on, Tom, let's take a look!\" urged Astro. \"They have the old\n_Space Queen_ in here, the first ship to clear Earth's gravity. Boy, I'd\nsure like to see her!\" Without waiting for the others to agree, the huge\ncandidate stepped off the slidestairs.\n\n\"Hey, Astro!\" yelled Tom. \"Wait! I don't think--\" His voice trailed off\nas the moving stair carried him up to the next floor.\n\nBut then a curious thing happened. As other boys came abreast of the\nmuseum floor and saw Astro they began to get off and follow him,\nwandering around gazing at the relics of the past.\n\nSoon nearly half of the cadet candidates were standing in silent awe in\nfront of the battered hull of the _Space Queen_, the first\natomic-powered rocket ship allowed on exhibition only fifty years before\nbecause of the deadly radioactivity in her hull, created when a lead\nbaffle melted in midspace and flooded the ship with murderous gamma\nrays.\n\nThey stood in front of the spaceship and listened while Astro, in a\nhushed voice, read the inscription on the bronze tablet.\n\n\"--Earth to Luna and return. 7th March 2051. In honor of the brave men\nof the first atomic-powered spaceship to land successfully on the planet\nMoon, only to perish on return to Earth....\"\n\n\"Candidates--staaaaaaaaannnnnd _too_!\"\n\nLike a clap of thunder Warrant Officer McKenny's voice jarred the boys\nout of their silence. He stepped forward like a bantam rooster and faced\nthe startled group of boys.\n\n\"I wanna know just _one_ thing! Who stepped off that slidestairs\n_first_?\"\n\nThe boys all hesitated.\n\n\"I guess I was the first, sir,\" said Astro, stepping forward.\n\n\"Oh, you guess you were, eh?\" roared McKenny.\n\nTaking a deep breath McKenny launched into a blistering tirade. His\nchoice of words were to be long remembered by the group and repeated to\nsucceeding classes. Storming against the huge Venusian like a pygmy\nattacking an elephant, McKenny roared, berated and blasted.\n\nLater, when Astro finally reached his quarters and changed into the\ngreen coveralls of the cadet candidates, Tom and Phil crowded around\nhim.\n\n\"It was Roger, blast him!\" said Tom angrily. \"He was getting back at you\nbecause Cadet Herbert made him carry his own gear.\"\n\n\"I asked for it,\" grumbled Astro. \"Ah, I should've known better. But I\njust couldn't wait to see the _Queen_.\" He balled his huge hands into\ntight knots and stared at the floor.\n\n\"Now hear this!!!\"\n\nA voice suddenly rasped over the PA system loud-speaker above the door.\n\"All cadet candidates will come to attention to receive the Space\nAcademy oath from Commander Walters.\" The voice paused. \"_AT-TENT-SHUN!_\nCadet candidates--Staaaaannnnd _TO_!\"\n\n\"This is Commander Walters speaking!\" A deep, powerful voice purred\nthrough the speaker. \"The Academy oath is taken individually.\n\n\"It is something each candidate locks in his spirit, his mind and his\nheart. That is why it is taken in your quarters. The oath is not a show\nof color, it is a way of life. Each candidate will face as closely as\npossible in the direction of his home and swear by his own individual\nGod as he repeats after me.\"\n\nAstro stepped quickly to the window port and gazed into the blue\nheavens, eyes searching out the misty planet Venus. Phil Morgan thought\na moment, and faced toward the wall with the inlaid star chart of the\nsky, thinking of sun-bathed Georgia. Tom Corbett stared straight at a\nblank wall.\n\nEach boy did not see what was in front of him yet he saw further,\nperhaps, than he had ever seen before. He looked into a future which\nheld the limitlessness of the universe and new worlds and planets to be\nlifted out of the oblivion of uncharted depths of space to come.\n\nThey repeated slowly....\n\n\" ... I solemnly swear to uphold the Constitution of the Solar Alliance,\nto obey interplanetary law, to protect the liberties of the planets, to\nsafeguard the freedom of space and to uphold the cause of peace\nthroughout the universe ... to this end, I dedicate my life!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\n\nTom Corbett's first day at Space Academy began at 0530 hours with the\nblaring of the _Cadet Corps Song_ over the central communicators:\n\n    \"_From the rocket fields of the Academy\n    To the far-flung stars of outer space,\n    We're Space Cadets training to be\n    Ready for dangers we may face._\n\n    _Up in the sky, rocketing past\n    Higher than high, faster than fast,\n    Out into space, into the sun\n    Look at her go when we give her the gun._\n\n    _From the rocket fields of the_....\"\n\nWithin sixty seconds, the buildings of the Academy rocked with the\nimpact of three thousand voices singing the last stanza. Lights flashed\non in every window. Cadets raced through the halls and across the\nquadrangle. The central communicator began the incessant mustering of\ncadets, and the never-ending orders of the day.\n\n\" ... Unit 38-Z report to Captain Edwards for astrogation. Unit 68-E\nreport to Commander Walters for special assignments.\"\n\nOn and on, down the list of senior cadets, watch officers, and the newly\narrived Earthworms. Units and individuals to report for training or\nstudy in everything from ground assembly of an atomic rocket motor, to\nthe history of the founding of the Solar Alliance, the governing body of\nthe tri-planet civilization.\n\nTom Corbett stepped out of the shower in Section 42-D and bellowed at\nthe top of his voice.\n\n\"Hit the deck, Astro! Make use of the gravity!\" He tugged at an outsized\nfoot dangling over the side of an upper bunk.\n\n\"Uhhhh-ahhhh-hummmmm,\" groaned the cadet from Venus and tried to go back\nto sleep.\n\nPhilip Morgan stepped into the shower, turned on the cold water,\nscreeched at the top of his voice, gradually trailing off into countless\nrepetitions of the last verse of the Academy song.\n\n\"Damp your tubes, you blasted space monkey,\" roared Astro, sitting up\nbleary-eyed.\n\n\"What time do we eat?\" asked Tom, pulling on the green one-piece\ncoverall of the Earthworm cadet candidates.\n\n\"I don't know,\" replied Astro, opening his mouth in a cavernous yawn.\n\"But it'd better be soon. I like space, but not between my backbone and\nmy stomach!\"\n\nWarrant Officer McKenny burst into the room and began to compete with\nthe rest of the noise outside the buildings.\n\n\"Five minutes to the dining hall and you'd better not be late! Take the\nslidestairs down to the twenty-eighth floor. Tell the mess cadet in\ncharge of the hall your unit number and he'll show you to the right\ntable. Remember where it is, because you'll have to find it yourself\nafter that, or not eat. Finish your breakfast and report to the\nninety-ninth floor to Dr. Dale at seven hundred hours!\"\n\nAnd as fast as he had arrived, he was gone, a flash of red color with\nrasping voice trailing behind.\n\nExactly one hour and ten minutes later, promptly at seven o'clock, the\nthree members of Unit 42-D stood at attention in front of Dr. Joan Dale,\nalong with the rest of the green-clad cadets.\n\nWhen the catcalls and wolf whistles had died away, Dr. Dale, pretty,\ntrim, and dressed in the gold and black uniform of the Solar Guard, held\nup her hand and motioned for the cadets to sit down.\n\n\"My answer to your--\" she paused, smiled and continued, \"your\nenthusiastic welcome is simply--thank you. But we'll have no further\nrepetitions. This is Space Academy--not a primary school!\"\n\nTurning abruptly, she stood beside a round desk in the well of an\namphitheater, and held up a thin tube about an inch in diameter and\ntwelve inches long.\n\n\"We will now begin your classification tests,\" she said. \"You will\nreceive one of these tubes. Inside, you will find four sheets of paper.\nYou are to answer all the questions on each paper and place them back in\nthe tube. Take the tube and drop it in the green outline slot in this\nwall.\"\n\nShe indicated a four-inch-round hole to her left, outlined with green\npaint. Beside it, was another slot outlined with red paint. \"Remain\nthere until the tube is returned to you in the red slot. Take it back to\nyour desk.\" She paused and glanced down at her desk.\n\n\"Now, there are four possible classifications for a cadet. Control-deck\nofficer, which includes leadership and command. Astrogation officer,\nwhich includes radar and communications. And power-deck officer for\nengine-room operations. The fourth classification is for advanced\nscientific study here at the Academy. Your papers are studied by an\nelectronic calculator that has proven infallible. You must make at least\na passing grade on each of the four classifications.\"\n\nDr. Dale looked up at the rows of upturned, unsmiling faces and stepped\nfrom the dais, coming to a halt near the first desk.\n\n\"I know that all of you here have your hearts set on becoming spacemen,\nofficers in the Solar Guard. Most of you want to be space pilots. But\nthere must be astrogators, radar engineers, communication officers and\npower-deck operators on each ship, and,\" she paused, braced her\nshoulders and added, \"some of you will not be accepted for any of these.\nSome of you will wash out.\"\n\nDr. Dale turned her back on the cadets, not wanting to look at the\nsudden pallor that washed over their faces. It was brutal, she thought,\nthis test. Why bring them all the way to the Academy and then give the\ntests? Why not start the entrance exams at the beginning with the\nclassification and aptitude? But she knew the answer even before the\nthoughtful question was completed. Under the fear of being washed out,\nthe weaker ones would not pass. The Solar Guard could not afford to have\ncadets and later Solar Guard officers who could not function under\npressure.\n\nShe began handing out the tubes and, one by one, the green-clad\ncandidates stepped to the front of the room to receive them.\n\n\"Excuse me, Ma'am,\" said one cadet falteringly. \"If--if--I wash out as a\ncadet--as a Solar Guard officer cadet\"--he gulped several times--\"does\nthat mean there isn't any chance of becoming a spaceman?\"\n\n\"No,\" she answered kindly. \"You can become a member of the enlisted\nSolar Guard, if you can pass the acceleration tests.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Ma'am,\" replied the boy and turned away nervously.\n\nTom Corbett accepted the tube and hurried back to his seat. He knew that\nthis was the last hurdle. He did not know that the papers had been\nprepared individually, the tests given on the basis of the entrance\nexams he had taken back at New Chicago Primary Space School.\n\nHe opened the tube, pulling out the four sheets, printed on both sides\nof the paper, and read the heading on the first: ASTROGATION,\nCOMMUNICATIONS, SIGNALS (_Radar_)\n\nHe studied the first question.\n\n\" ... What is the range of the Mark Nine radar-scope, and how far can a\nspaceship be successfully distinguished from other objects in space?...\"\n\nHe read the question four times, then pulled out a pencil and began to\nwrite.\n\nOnly the rustle of the papers, or the occasional sigh of a cadet over a\nproblem, disturbed the silence in the high-ceilinged room, as the\nhundred-odd cadets fought the questions.\n\nThere was a sudden stir in the room and Tom looked up to see Roger\nManning walk to the slot and casually deposit his tube in the\ngreen-bordered slot. Then he leaned idly against the wall waiting for it\nto be returned. As he stood there, he spoke to Dr. Dale, who smiled and\nreplied. There was something about his attitude that made Tom boil. So\nfast? He glanced at his own papers. He had hardly finished two sheets\nand thought he was doing fine. He clenched his teeth and bent over the\npaper again, redoubling his efforts to triangulate a fix on Regulus by\nusing dead reckoning as a basis for his computations.\n\nSuddenly a tall man, wearing the uniform of a Solar Guard officer,\nappeared in the back of the room. As Dr. Dale looked up and smiled a\ngreeting, he placed his finger on his lips. Steve Strong, Captain in the\nSolar Guard, gazed around the room at the backs bent over busy pencils.\nHe did not smile, remembering how, only fifteen years before, he had\ngone through the same torture, racking his brains trying to adjust the\nmeasurements of a magnascope prism. He was joined by a thin handsome\nyoung man, Lieutenant Judson Saminsky, and finally, Warrant Officer\nMcKenny. They nodded silently in greeting. It would be over soon. Strong\nglanced at the clock over the desk. Another ten minutes to go.\n\nThe line of boys at the slots grew until more than twenty stood there,\neach waiting patiently, nervously, for his turn to drop the tube in the\nslot and receive in return the sealed cylinder that held his fate.\n\nStill at his desk, his face wet with sweat, Astro looked at the question\nin front of him for the fifteenth time.\n\n\" ... Estimate the time it would take a 300-ton rocket ship with\nhalf-filled tanks, cruising at the most economical speed to make a trip\nfrom Titan to Venusport. (a) Estimate size and maximum capacity of fuel\ntanks. (b) Give estimate of speed ship would utilize....\"\n\nHe thought. He slumped in his chair. He stared at the ceiling. He chewed\nhis pencil....\n\nFive seats away, Tom stacked his examination sheets neatly, twisted them\ninto a cylinder and inserted them in the tube. As he passed the line of\ndesks and headed for the slot, a hand caught his arm. Tom turned to see\nRoger Manning grinning at him.\n\n\"Worried, spaceboy?\" asked Roger easily. Tom didn't answer. He simply\nwithdrew his arm.\n\n\"You know,\" said Roger, \"you're really a nice kid. It's a shame you\nwon't make it. But the rules specifically say 'no cabbageheads.'\"\n\n\"No talking!\" Dr. Dale called sharply from her desk.\n\nTom walked away and stood in the line at the slots. He found himself\nwanting to pass more than anything in the world. \"Please,\" he breathed,\n\"please, just let me pass--\"\n\nA soft gong began to sound. Dr. Dale stood up.\n\n\"Time's up,\" she announced. \"Please put your papers in the tubes and\ndrop them in the slot.\"\n\nTom turned to see Astro stuffing his papers in the thin cylinder\ndisgustedly. Phil Morgan came up and stood in back of Tom. His face was\nflushed.\n\n\"Everything O.K., Phil?\" inquired Tom.\n\n\"Easy as free falling in space,\" replied the other cadet, his soft\nGeorgian drawl full of confidence. \"How about you?\"\n\n\"I'm just hoping against hope.\"\n\nThe few remaining stragglers hurried up to the line.\n\n\"Think Astro'll make it?\" asked Phil.\n\n\"I don't know,\" answered Tom, \"I saw him sweating over there like a man\nfacing death.\"\n\n\"I guess he is--in a way.\"\n\nAstro took his place in line and shrugged his shoulders when Tom leaned\nforward to give him a questioning look.\n\n\"Go ahead, Tom,\" urged Phil. Tom turned and dropped his tube into the\ngreen-bordered slot and waited. He stared straight at the wall in front\nof him, hardly daring to breathe. Presently, the tube was returned in\nthe red slot. He took it, turned it over in his hands and walked slowly\nback to his desk.\n\n\"You're washed out, cabbagehead!\" Manning's whisper followed him. \"Let's\nsee if you can take it without bawling!\"\n\nTom's face burned and he fought an impulse to answer Manning with a\nstiff belt in the jaw. But he kept walking, reached his desk and sat\ndown.\n\nAstro, the last to return to his desk, held the tube out in front of him\nas if it were alive. The room was silent as Dr. Dale rose from her desk.\n\n\"All right now, boys,\" she announced. \"Inside the tubes you will find\ncolored slips of paper. Those of you who have red slips will remain\nhere. Those who find green slips will return to their quarters. Blue\nwill go with Captain Strong, orange with Lieutenant Saminsky, and purple\nwith Warrant Officer McKenny. Now--please open the tubes.\"\n\nThere was a tinkling of metal caps and then the slight rustle of paper\nas each boy withdrew the contents of the tube before him.\n\nTom took a deep breath and felt inside for the paper. He held his breath\nand pulled it out. It was green. He didn't know what it meant. He looked\naround. Phil was signaling to him, holding up a blue slip. Tom's heart\nskipped a beat. Whatever the colors meant, he and Phil were apart. He\nquickly turned around and caught Astro's eye. The big Venusian held up a\ngreen slip. Tom's heart then nearly stopped beating. Phil, who had\nbreezed through with such confidence, held a blue slip, and Astro, who\nhadn't even finished the test, held up the same color that he had. It\ncould only mean one thing. Failure. He felt the tears welling in his\neyes, but had no strength left to fight them back.\n\nHe looked up, his eyes meeting the insolent stare of Roger Manning who\nwas half turned in his seat. Remembering the caustic warning of the\nconfident cadet, Tom fought back the flood in his eyes and glared back.\n\nWhat would he tell his mother? And his father? And Billy, his brother,\nfive years younger than himself, whom he had promised to bring a flask\nof water from the Grand Canal on Mars. And his sister! Tom remembered\nthe shining pride in her eyes when she kissed him good-bye at the\nStratoport as he left for Atom City.\n\nFrom the front of the room, McKenny's rasping voice jarred him back to\nthe present.\n\n\"Cadets--staaaaaaaand _to!_\"\n\nThere was a shuffle of feet as the boys rose as one.\n\n\"All the purple slips follow me,\" he roared and turned toward the door.\nThe cadets with purple slips marched after him.\n\nLieutenant Saminsky stepped briskly to the front of the room.\n\n\"Cadets with orange slips will please come with me,\" he said casually,\nand another group of cadets left the room.\n\nFrom the rear of the room Captain Strong snapped out an order.\n\n\"Blue slips will come with me!\"\n\nHe turned smartly and followed the last of Lieutenant Saminsky's cadets\nout of the room.\n\nTom looked around. The room was nearly empty now. He looked over at\nAstro and saw his big friend slumped moodily over against his desk.\nThen, suddenly, he noticed Roger Manning. The arrogant cadet was not\nsmiling any longer. He was staring straight ahead. Before him on the\ndesk, Tom could see a green slip. So he had failed too, thought Tom\ngrimly. It was poor solace for the misery he felt.\n\nDr. Dale stepped forward again.\n\n\"Will the cadets holding green slips return to their quarters. Those\nwith red slips will remain in their seats,\" she announced.\n\nTom found himself moving with difficulty. As he walked through the door,\nAstro joined him. A look more eloquent than words passed between them\nand they made their way silently up the slidestairs back to their\nquarters.\n\nLying in his bunk, hands under his head, eyes staring into space, Tom\nasked, \"What happens now?\"\n\nSprawled on his bunk, Astro didn't answer right away. He merely gulped\nand swallowed hard.\n\n\"I--I don't know,\" he finally stammered. \"I just don't know.\"\n\n\"What'll you do?\"\n\n\"It's back to the hold of a Venusport freighter, I guess. I don't know.\"\nAstro paused and looked at Tom. \"What'll you do?\"\n\n\"Go home,\" said Tom simply. \"Go home and--and find a job.\"\n\n\"Ever think about the enlisted Solar Guard? Look at McKenny--\"\n\n\"Yeah--but--\"\n\n\"I know how you feel,\" sighed Astro. \"Being in the enlisted section--is\nlike--well, being a passenger--almost.\"\n\nThe door was suddenly flung open.\n\n\"Haul off them bunks, you blasted Earthworms!\"\n\nMcKenny stood in the doorway in his usual aggressive pose, and Tom and\nAstro hit the floor together to stand at attention.\n\n\"Where's the other cadet?\"\n\n\"He went with Captain Strong, sir,\" answered Tom.\n\n\"Oh?\" said Mike. And in a surprisingly soft tone he added, \"You two\npulled green slips, eh?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" they replied together.\n\n\"Well, I don't know how you did it, but congratulations. You passed the\nclassification tests. Both of you.\"\n\nTom just looked at the scarlet-clad, stumpy warrant officer. He couldn't\nbelieve his ears. Suddenly he felt as if he had been lifted off his\nfeet. And then he realized that he _was_ off his feet. Astro was holding\nhim over his head. Then he dumped him in his bunk as easily as if he\nhad been a child. And at the same time, the big Venusian let out a loud,\nlong, earsplitting yell.\n\nMcKenny matched him with his bull-like roar.\n\n\"Plug that foghorn, you blasted Earthworm. You'll have the whole Academy\nin here thinking there's a murder.\"\n\nBy this time Tom was on his feet again, standing in front of McKenny.\n\n\"You mean, we made it? We're really in? We're cadets?\"\n\n\"That's right.\" McKenny looked at a clip board in his hand and read,\n\"Cadet Corbett, Tom. Qualified for control deck. Cadet Astro. Power\ndeck.\"\n\nAstro took a deep breath and started another yell, but before he could\nlet go, McKenny clamped a big hand over his mouth.\n\n\"You bellow like that again and I'll make meteor dust out of you!\"\n\nAstro gulped and then matched Tom's grin with one that spread from ear\nto ear.\n\n\"What happened to Philip Morgan?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"What color slip did he have?\"\n\n\"Blue.\"\n\n\"Anything besides green washed out,\" replied Mike quickly. \"Now let's\nsee, you have a replacement for Morgan in this unit. An astrogator.\"\n\n\"Greetings, gentlemen,\" drawled a voice that Tom recognized without even\nlooking. \"Allow me to introduce myself to my new unit-mates. My name is\nManning--Roger Manning. But then, we're old friends, aren't we?\"\n\n\"Stow that rocket wash, Manning,\" snapped Mike. He glanced at the clock\nover the door. \"You have an hour and forty-five minutes until lunch\ntime. I suggest you take a walk around the Academy and familiarize\nyourselves with the arrangement of the buildings.\"\n\nAnd then, for the first time, Tom saw the hard little spaceman smile.\n\n\"I'm glad you made it, boys. All three of you.\" He paused and looked at\neach of them in turn. \"And I can honestly say I'm looking forward to the\nday when I can serve under you!\"\n\nHe snapped his back straight, gave the three startled boys a crisp\nsalute, executed a perfect about-face and marched out of the room.\n\n\"And that,\" drawled Roger, strolling to the bunk nearest the window, \"is\nthe corniest bit of space gas I've ever heard.\"\n\n\"Listen, Manning!\" growled Astro, spinning around quickly to face him.\n\n\"Yeah,\" purred Roger, his eyes drawn to fine points, hands hanging\nloosely at his sides. \"What would you like me to listen to, Cadet\nAstro?\"\n\nThe hulking cadet lunged at Manning, but Tom quickly stepped between\nthem.\n\n\"Stow it, both of you!\" he shouted. \"We're in this room together, so we\nmight as well make the best of it.\"\n\n\"Of course, Corbett--of course,\" replied Manning easily. He turned his\nback on Astro, who stood, feet wide apart, neck muscles tight and hands\nclenched in hamlike fists.\n\n\"One of these days I'll break you in two, Manning. I'll close that\nfast-talking mouth of yours for good!\"\n\nAstro's voice was a low growl. Roger stood near the window port and\nappeared to have forgotten the incident.\n\nThe light shining in from the hallway darkened, and Tom turned to see\nthree blue-clad senior cadets arranged in a row just inside the door.\n\n\"Congratulations, gentlemen. You're now qualified cadets of Space\nAcademy,\" said a redheaded lad about twenty-one. \"My name is Al Dixon,\"\nhe turned to his left and right, \"and these are cadets Bill Houseman\nand Rodney Withrop.\"\n\n\"Hiya,\" replied Tom. \"Glad to know you. I'm Tom Corbett. This is\nAstro--and Roger Manning.\"\n\nAstro shook hands, the three senior cadets giving a long glance at the\nsize of the hand he offered. Roger came forward smartly and shook hands\nwith a smile.\n\n\"We're sorta like a committee,\" began Dixon. \"We've come to sign you up\nfor the Academy sports program.\"\n\nThey made themselves comfortable in the room.\n\n\"You have a chance to take part in three sports. Free-fall wrestling,\nmercuryball and space chess.\" Dixon glanced at Houseman and Withrop.\n\"From the looks of Cadet Astro, free-fall wrestling should be child's\nplay for him!\"\n\nAstro merely grinned.\n\n\"Mercuryball is pretty much like the old game of soccer,\" explained\nHouseman. \"But inside the ball is a smaller ball filled with mercury,\nmaking it take crazy dips and turns. You have to be pretty fast even to\ntouch it.\"\n\n\"Sounds like you have to be a little Mercurian yourself,\" smiled Tom.\n\n\"You do,\" replied Dixon. \"Oh, yes, you three play as a unit. Competition\nstarts in a few days. So if you've never played before, you might go\ndown to the gym and start practicing.\"\n\n\"You mentioned space chess,\" asked Roger. \"What's that?\"\n\n\"It's really nothing more than maneuvers. Space maneuvers,\" said Dixon.\n\"A glass case, a seven-foot cube, is divided by light shafts into\nsmaller cubes of equal shape and size. Each man has a complete space\nsquadron. Three model rocket cruisers, six destroyers and ten scouts.\nThe ships are filled with gas to make them float, and your power is\nderived from magnetic force. The problem is to get a combination of\ncruisers and destroyers and scouts into a space section where it could\nknock out your opponent's ships.\"\n\n\"You mean,\" interrupted Astro, \"you've got to keep track of all those\nships at once?\"\n\n\"Don't worry, Astro,\" commented Roger quickly. \"You use your muscles to\nwin for dear old 42-D in free-fall wrestling. Corbett here can pound\ndown the grassy field for a goal in mercuryball, and I'll do the\nbrainwork of space chess.\"\n\nThe three visiting cadets exchanged sharp glances.\n\n\"Everybody plays together, Manning,\" said Dixon. \"You three take part in\neach sport as a unit.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" nodded Roger. \"Of course--as a unit.\"\n\nThe three cadets stood up, shook hands all around and left. Tom\nimmediately turned to Manning.\n\n\"What was the idea of that crack about brains?\"\n\nManning slouched over to the window port and said over his shoulder, \"I\ndon't know how you and your king-sized friend here passed the\nclassifications test, Corbett, and I don't care. But, as you say, we're\na unit. So we might as well make adjustments.\"\n\nHe turned to face them with a cold stare.\n\n\"I know this Academy like the palm of my hand,\" he went on. \"Never mind\nhow, just take it for granted. _I know it._ I'm here for the ride. For a\nspecial reason I wouldn't care to have you know. I'll get my training\nand then pull out.\"\n\nHe took a step forward, his face a mask of bitterness.\n\n\"So from now on, you two guys leave me alone. You bore me to death with\nyour emotional childish allegiance to this--this\"--he paused and spit\nthe last out cynically--\"space kindergarten!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\n\n\"I just can't understand it, Joan,\" said Captain Steve Strong, tossing\nthe paper on his circular desk. \"The psychographs of Corbett, Manning\nand Astro fit together like gears. And yet--\"\n\nThe Solar Guard officer suddenly rose and walked over to a huge window\nthat filled the entire north wall of his office, a solid sheet of glass\nthat extended from the high domed ceiling to the translucent flooring.\nThrough the window, he stared down moodily toward the grassy quadrangle,\nwhere at the moment several hundred cadets were marching in formation\nunder a hot sun.\n\n\"--And yet,\" continued Strong, \"every morning for the last three weeks\nI've got a report from McKenny about some sort of friction between\nthem!\"\n\n\"I think it'll work out, Steve,\" answered the pretty girl in the uniform\nof the Solar Guard, seated in an easy chair on the other side of the\ndesk.\n\nJoan Dale held the distinction of being the first woman ever admitted\ninto the Solar Guard, in a capacity other than administrative work. Her\nexperiments in atomic fissionables was the subject of a recent\nscientific symposium held on Mars. Over fifty of the leading scientists\nof the Solar Alliance had gathered to study her latest theory on\nhyperdrive, and had unanimously declared her ideas valid. She had been\noffered the chair as Master of Physics at the Academy as a result,\ngiving her access to the finest laboratory in the tri-planet society.\n\nNow facing the problem of personality adjustment in Unit 42-D, she sat\nacross the desk from her childhood friend, Steve Strong, and frowned.\n\n\"What's happened this time?\"\n\n\"Manning.\" He paused. \"It seems to be all Manning!\"\n\n\"You mean he's the more aggressive of the three?\"\n\n\"No--not necessarily. Corbett shows signs of being a number-one\nspaceman. And that big cadet, Astro\"--Strong flashed a white smile that\ncontrasted with his deep space tan--\"I don't think he could make a\nmanual mistake on the power deck if he tried. You know, I actually saw\nhim put an auxiliary rocket motor together blindfolded!\"\n\nThe pretty scientist smiled. \"I could have told you that after one look\nat his classification tests.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"On questions concerning the power-deck operations, he was letter\nperfect--\"\n\n\"And on the others? Astrogation and control deck?\"\n\n\"He just skimmed by. But even where the problem involved fuel, power,\nsupply of energy, he offered some very practical answer to the problem.\"\nShe smiled. \"Astro is as much an artist on that power deck as Liddy\nTamal doing Juliet in the stereos.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" mused Strong. \"And Corbett is the same on the control deck. Good\ninstinctive intelligence. That boy soaks up knowledge like a sponge.\"\n\n\"Facile mind--quick to grasp the essentials.\" She smiled again. \"Seems\nto me I remember a few years back when a young lieutenant successfully\nput down a mutiny in space, and at his promotion to captain, the\ncitation included the fact that he was quick to grasp the essentials.\"\n\nStrong grinned sheepishly. A routine flight to Titan had misfired into\nopen rebellion by the crew. Using a trick picked up in ancient history\nbooks of sea-roving pirates in the seventeenth century, he had joined\nthe mutiny, gained control of the ship, sought out the ring-leaders and\nrestored discipline.\n\n\"And Manning,\" asked Strong. \"What about Manning?\"\n\n\"One of the hardest, brightest minds I've come across in the Academy. He\nhas a brain like a steel trap. He never misses.\"\n\n\"Then, do you think he's acting up because Corbett is the nominal head\nof the unit? Does he feel that he should be the command cadet in the\ncontrol deck instead of Corbett?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Dr. Dale. \"Not at all. I'm sure he intentionally missed\nproblems about control deck and command in his classification test. He\nconcentrated on astrogation, communications and signal radar. He wanted\nto be assigned to the radar deck. And he turned in the best paper I've\never read from a cadet to get the post.\"\n\nStrong threw up his hands. \"Then what is it? Here we have a unit, on\npaper at least, that could be number one. A good combination of brains,\nexperience and knowledge. Everything that's needed. And what is the\nresult? Friction!\"\n\nSuddenly a buzzer sounded, and on Steve Strong's desk a small teleceiver\nscreen glowed into life. Gradually the stern face of Commander Walters\nemerged.\n\n\"Sorry to disturb you, Steve. Can you spare me a minute?\"\n\n\"Of course, Commander,\" replied Strong. \"Is anything wrong?\"\n\n\"Very wrong, Steve. I've been looking over the daily performance reports\non Unit 42-D.\"\n\n\"Dr. Dale and I have just been discussing that situation, sir.\" A\nrelieved expression passed over the commander's face.\n\n\"Good! I wanted to get your opinions before I broke up the unit.\"\n\n\"No, sir!\" said Strong quickly. \"Don't do that!\"\n\n\"Oh?\" replied the commander. On the screen he could be seen settling\nback in his chair.\n\n\"And why not?\"\n\n\"Well, Joan--er--Dr. Dale and myself feel that the boys of Unit 42-D\nmake it potentially the best in the Academy--if they stay together,\nsir.\"\n\nWalters considered this for a moment and then asked thoughtfully, \"Give\nme one good reason why the unit shouldn't be washed out.\"\n\n\"The academy needs boys like this, sir,\" Steve answered flatly. \"Needs\ntheir intelligence, their experience. They may be a problem now, but if\nthey're handled right, they'll turn out to be ace spacemen, they'll--\"\n\nThe commander interrupted. \"You're pretty sold on them, aren't you,\nSteve?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, I am.\"\n\n\"You know, tomorrow all the units will be assigned to their personal\ninstructors.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. And I've selected Lieutenant Wolcheck for this unit. He's\ntough and smart. I think he's just the man for the job.\"\n\n\"I don't agree, Steve. Wolcheck is a fine officer and with any other\nunit there'd be no question. But I think we have a better man for the\njob.\"\n\n\"Whom do you suggest, sir?\"\n\nThe commander leaned forward in his chair.\n\n\"You, Steve.\"\n\n\"Me?\"\n\n\"What do you think, Joan?\"\n\n\"I wanted to make the same suggestion, Commander,\" smiled Joan. \"But I\ndidn't know if Steve really would want the assignment.\"\n\n\"Well, what about it, Steve?\" asked the commander. \"This is no\nreflection on your present work. But if you're so convinced that 42-D is\nworth the trouble, then take them over and mold them into spacemen.\nOtherwise, I'll have to wash them out.\"\n\nStrong hesitated a moment. \"All right, sir. I'll do my best.\"\n\nOn the screen the stern lines in Commander Walters' face relaxed and he\nsmiled approvingly.\n\n\"Thanks, Steve,\" he said softly. \"I was hoping you'd say that. Keep me\nposted.\"\n\nThe screen blacked out abruptly and Captain Strong turned to Joan Dale,\na troubled frown wrinkling his brow.\n\n\"Huh. I really walked into that one, didn't I?\" he muttered.\n\n\"It isn't going to be easy, Steve,\" she replied.\n\n\"Easy!\" He snorted and walked over to the window to stare blankly at the\nquadrangle below. \"I'd almost rather try a landing on the hot side of\nMercury. It would be icy compared to this situation!\"\n\n\"You can do it, Steve. I know you can.\" Joan moved to his side to place\na reassuring hand on his arm.\n\nThe Solar Guard officer didn't answer immediately. He kept on staring at\nthe Academy grounds and buildings spread out before him. When he finally\nspoke, his voice rang with determination.\n\n\"I've got to do it, Joan. I've got to whip those boys into a unit. Not\nonly for their sakes--but for the sake of the Academy!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\n\nThe first three weeks of an Earthworm's life at Space Academy are filled\nwith never-ending physical training and conditioning to meet the rigors\nof rocket flight and life on distant planets. And under the grueling\npressure of fourteen-hour days, filled with backbreaking exercises and\nlong forced marches, very few of the boys can find anything more\ndesirable than sleep--and more sleep.\n\nUnder this pressure the friction in Unit 42-D became greater and\ngreater. Roger and Astro continually needled each other with insults,\nand Tom gradually slipped into the role of arbiter.\n\nReturning from a difficult afternoon of endless marching in the hot sun\nwith the prospect of an evening of free-fall wrestling before them, the\nthree cadets dragged themselves wearily onto the slidestairs leading to\ntheir quarters, their muscles screaming for rest.\n\n\"Another day like this,\" began Astro listlessly, \"and I'm going to melt\ndown to nothing. Doesn't McKenny have a heart?\"\n\n\"No, just an asteroid,\" Tom grumbled. \"He'll never know how close he\ncame to getting a space boot in the face when he woke us up this\nmorning. Oh, man! Was I tired!\"\n\n\"Stop complaining, will you?\" snarled Roger. \"All I've heard from you\ntwo space crawlers is gripes and complaints.\"\n\n\"If I wasn't so tired, Roger,\" said Astro, \"I'd give you something to\ngripe about. A flat lip!\"\n\n\"Knock it off, Astro,\" said Tom wearily. The role of keeping them apart\nwas getting tiresome.\n\n\"The trouble with you, Astro,\" pursued Roger, \"is that you think with\nyour muscles instead of your head.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I know. And you've got an electronic calculator for a brain. All\nyou have to do is push a button and you get the answers all laid out for\nyou.\"\n\nThey had reached their quarters now and were stripping off their\nsweat-soaked uniforms in preparation for a cool shower.\n\n\"You know, Roger,\" continued Astro, \"you've got a real problem ahead of\nyou.\"\n\n\"Any problem you think I have is no problem at all,\" was the cool reply.\n\n\"Yes, it is,\" insisted Astro. \"When you're ready for your first hop in\nspace, you won't be able to make it!\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"They don't have a space helmet in the Academy large enough to fit that\noverinflated head of yours!\"\n\nRoger turned slowly and spoke to Tom without looking at him. \"Close the\ndoor, Corbett!\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Tom, puzzled.\n\n\"Because I don't want any interruptions. I'm going to take that big hunk\nof Venusian space junk apart.\"\n\n\"Anything you say, you bigmouthed squirt!\" roared Astro.\n\n\"Hey--knock it off!\" yelled Tom, jumping between them and grabbing\nAstro's arm. \"If you guys don't lay off each other, you're going to be\nthrown out of the Academy, and I'll be thrown out with you! I'll be\nblasted if I'll suffer for your mistakes!\"\n\n\"That's a very interesting statement, Corbett!\" A deep voice purred\nfrom the doorway and the three boys whirled to see Captain Strong walk\ninto the room, his black and gold uniform fitting snugly across the\nshoulders betraying their latent strength. \"Stand to--all of you!\"\n\nAs the boys quickly snapped to attention, Strong eyed them slowly and\nthen moved casually around the room. He picked up a book, looked out of\nthe window port, pushed a boot to one side and, finally, removed Tom's\nsweat-stained uniform from a chair and sat down. The cadets held their\nrigid poses, backs stiff, eyes looking straight ahead.\n\n\"Corbett?\" snapped Strong.\n\n\"Yes, sir?\"\n\n\"What was the meaning of that little speech I heard a moment ago?\"\n\n\"I--ah--don't quite understand what you mean, sir,\" stumbled Tom.\n\n\"I think you do,\" said Strong. \"I want to know what provoked you to make\nsuch a statement.\"\n\n\"I'd rather not answer that, sir.\"\n\n\"Don't get cute, Corbett!\" barked Strong. \"I know what's going on in\nthis unit. Were Manning and Astro squaring off to fight?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Tom slowly.\n\n\"All right. At ease all of you,\" said Strong. The three boys relaxed and\nfaced the officer.\n\n\"Manning, do you want to be a successful cadet here at Space Academy?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" answered Roger.\n\n\"Then why don't you act like it?\" asked Strong.\n\n\"Is there something wrong with my work, sir?\" Tom recognized the smooth\nManning confidence begin to appear, and he wondered if Captain Strong\nwould be taken in.\n\n\"Everything's wrong with your work,\" barked Strong. \"You're too smart!\nKnow too much!\" He stopped short and then added softly with biting\nsarcasm, \"Why do you know so much, Cadet Manning?\"\n\nRoger hesitated. \"I've studied very hard. Studied for years to become a\nSpace Cadet,\" he replied.\n\n\"Just to be a cadet or a successful cadet _and_ a Solar Guard officer?\"\n\n\"To be successful at both, sir.\"\n\n\"Tell me, Manning, do you have any ideas on life?\"\n\n\"That's a pretty general question, sir. Do you mean life as a whole or a\nspecific part of life?\" They're fencing with each other, thought Tom. He\nheld his breath as Strong eyed the relaxed, confident cadet.\n\n\"A spaceman is supposed to have but one idea in life, Manning. And that\nidea is _space_!\"\n\n\"I see, sir,\" replied Roger, as a faraway look came into his eyes.\n\n\"Yes, sir, I have some ideas about life in space.\"\n\n\"I'd like to hear them!\" requested Strong coldly.\n\n\"Very well, sir.\" Roger relaxed his shoulders and leaned against the\nbunk. \"I believe space is the last frontier of man--Earthman. It's the\nlast place for man to conquer. It is the greatest adventure of all time\nand I want to be a part of that adventure.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Manning.\" Strong's voice was even colder than before. \"But\nas it happens, I can read too. That was a direct quote from the closing\nparagraph of Jon Builker's book on his trip to the stars!\" He paused.\n\"Couldn't you think of anything original to say?\"\n\nRoger flushed and gritted his teeth. Tom could hardly keep himself from\nlaughing. Captain Strong had scored heavily!\n\nThe Solar Guard officer then turned his attention to Astro.\n\n\"Astro, where in the name of the universe did you get the idea you could\nbe an officer in the Solar Guard?\"\n\n\"I can handle anything with push in it, sir!\" Astro smiled his\nconfidence.\n\n\"Know anything about hyperdrive?\"\n\n\"Uhh--no, sir.\"\n\n\"Then you can't handle everything with, as you say, push in it!\" snapped\nStrong.\n\n\"Er--no, sir,\" answered Astro, his face clouding over.\n\nThere was a long moment of silence while Strong lifted one knee, swung\nit over the arm of his chair, and looked steadily at the two half-naked\nboys in front of him. He smiled lazily.\n\n\"Well, for two Earthworms, you've certainly been acting like a couple of\nspace aces!\"\n\nHe let that soak in while he toyed with the gleaming Academy ring on his\nfinger. He allowed it to flash in the light of the window port, then\nslipped it off and flipped it over to Corbett.\n\n\"Know what that is?\" he asked the curly-haired cadet.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Tom. \"Your Academy graduation ring.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh. Now give it to our friend from Venus.\" Tom gingerly handed\nAstro the ring.\n\n\"Try it on, Astro,\" invited Strong.\n\nThe big cadet tried it on all of his fingers but couldn't get it past\nthe first joint.\n\n\"Give it to Manning.\"\n\nRoger accepted the ring and held it in the palm of his hand. He looked\nat it with a hard stare, then dropped it in the outstretched hand of the\nSolar Guard officer. Replacing it on his finger, Strong spoke casually.\n\n\"All units design their own rings. There are only three like this in the\nuniverse. One is drifting around in space on the finger of Sam Jones.\nAnother is blasting a trail to the stars on the finger of Addy Garcia.\"\nHe held up his finger. \"This is the third one.\"\n\nStrong got up and began to pace in front of the boys.\n\n\"Addy Garcia couldn't speak a word of English when he first came to the\nAcademy. And for eight weeks Sam and I sweated to figure out what he was\ntalking about. I think we spent over a hundred hours in the galley doing\nKP because Addy kept getting us fouled up. But that didn't bother us\nbecause we were a unit. Unit 33-V. Class of 2338.\"\n\nStrong turned to face the silent cadets.\n\n\"Sam Jones was pretty much like you, Astro. Not as big, but with the\nsame love for that power deck. He could always squeeze a few extra\npounds of thrust out of those rockets. What he knew about astrogation\nand control, you could stick on the head of a pin. On long flights he\nwouldn't even come up to the control deck. He just sat in the power hole\nsinging loud corny songs about the Arkansas mountains to those atomic\nmotors. He was a real power-deck man. But he was a _unit_ man first! The\nonly reason I'm here to tell you about it is because he never forgot the\nunit. He died saving Addy and myself.\"\n\nThe room was still. Down the long hall, the lively chatter of other\ncadets could be heard as they showered and prepared for dinner. In the\ndistance, the rumble of the slidewalks and test firing of rockets at the\nspaceport was dim, subdued, powerful.\n\n\"The unit is the backbone of the Academy,\" continued Strong. \"It was set\nup to develop three men to handle a Solar Guard rocket cruiser. Three\nmen who could be taught to think, feel and act as one intelligent brain.\nThree men who would respect each other and who could depend on each\nother. Tomorrow you begin your real education. You will be supervised\nand instructed personally.\n\n\"Many men have contributed to the knowledge that will be placed in\nfront of you--brave, intelligent men, who blasted through the atmosphere\nwith a piece of metal under them for a spaceship and a fire in their\ntail for rockets. But everything they accomplished goes to waste if the\nunit can't become a single personality. It must be a single personality,\nor it doesn't exist. The unit is the ultimate of hundreds of years of\nresearch and progress. But you have to fight to create it and keep it\nliving. Either you want it, or you get out of the Academy!\"\n\nCaptain Strong turned away momentarily and Tom and Astro looked at Roger\nsignificantly.\n\n\"Stand to!\"\n\nThe three boys snapped to attention as the wide-shouldered captain\naddressed them again.\n\n\"Tomorrow you begin to learn how to think as a single brain. To act with\ncombined intelligence as one person. You either make up your minds to\nstart tomorrow or you report to Commander Walters and resign. There\nisn't any room here for individuals.\"\n\nHe stepped to the door and paused.\n\n\"One more thing. I've been given the job of making you over into\nspacemen. I'm your unit commander. If you're still here in the morning,\nI'll accept that as your answer. If you think you can't take\"--he\npaused--\"what I'm going to dish out, then you know what you can do. And\nif you stay, you'll _be_ the best unit, or I'll break you in two in the\nattempt. Unit dis ... missed!\" And he was gone.\n\nThe three cadets stood still, not knowing quite what to do or say.\nFinally Tom stepped before Astro and Roger.\n\n\"Well,\" he said quietly, \"how about it, you guys? Are you going to lay\noff each other now?\"\n\nAstro flushed, but Roger eyed Corbett coolly.\n\n\"Were you really taken in with that space gas, Tom?\" He turned to the\nshower room. \"If you were, then you're more childish than I thought.\"\n\n\"A man died to save another man's life, Roger. Sam Jones. I never knew\nhim. But I've met Captain Strong, and I believe that he would have done\nthe same thing for Jones.\"\n\n\"Very noble,\" commented Roger from the doorway.\n\n\"But I'll tell you this, Manning,\" said Tom, following him, fighting for\nself-control, \"I wouldn't want to have to depend on you to save my life.\nAnd I wouldn't want to be faced with the situation where I would have to\nsacrifice mine to save yours!\"\n\nRoger turned and glared at Tom.\n\n\"The Academy regs say that the man on the control deck is the boss of\nthe unit. But I have my private opinion of the man who has that job\nnow!\"\n\n\"What's that supposed to mean?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"Just this, spaceboy. There's a gym below where I'll take you _or_ your\nbig friend on--together--or one at a time.\" He paused, a cold smile\ntwisting his lips. \"And that offer is good as of right now!\"\n\nTom and Astro looked at each other.\n\n\"I'm afraid,\" began Astro slowly, \"that you wouldn't stand much of a\nchance with me, Manning. So if Tom wants the chore of buttoning your\nlip, he's welcome to it.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Astro,\" said Tom evenly. \"It'll be my pleasure.\"\n\nWithout another word, the three cadets walked out of the door.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5\n\n\n\"Will this do, Manning?\" asked Tom.\n\nThe three boys were in a secluded corner of the gym, a large hall on the\nfourteenth floor of the dormitory building. At the far end of the gym, a\ngroup of cadets had just finished a game of mercuryball and were\nsauntering to the showers. When the last boy had disappeared, the floor\nwas deserted except for Tom, Roger and Astro.\n\n\"This will do fine, Corbett,\" said Roger.\n\nThe boxing ring had been taken down the week before to make room for\ndrills and the physical exercises of the Earthworms, so the three boys\nhad to improvise a ring. They dragged four large tumbling mats together,\nspreading them side by side to form a square close to the size of an\nactual ring. Astro went to one of the small lockers under the balcony\nand returned with two pairs of boxing gloves.\n\n\"Here,\" offered Astro, \"put these on.\"\n\n\"Gloves?\" asked Roger, in a voice of mock surprise. \"I thought this was\ngoing to be a battle of blood.\"\n\n\"Any way you want it, Manning. Any way at all,\" said Tom.\n\n\"You're going to use gloves,\" growled Astro. \"I don't want anybody\nkilled.\" He threw a pair at each of them.\n\n\"There'll be three-minute rounds, with one minute rest,\" he continued.\n\"Go off the mats and you'll be counted out. Usual rules otherwise. Any\nquestions?\"\n\n\"Clear to me, Astro,\" said Tom.\n\n\"Let's go,\" nodded Roger.\n\n\"One more thing,\" said Astro. \"I hope Tom pins your ears back, Manning.\nBut I'm going to see that both of you get a fair deal. So keep the\npunches up--and fight it out. All right--time!\"\n\nThe two boys moved carefully to the center of the improvised ring, their\nguards up, while Astro stood off the edge of the mat and watched the\nsweeping second hand of his wrist chronograph.\n\nShuffling forward Tom pushed out a probing left and then tried to cross\nhis right, but Manning stepped back easily, countering with a hard left\nto Tom's heart.\n\n\"I forgot to tell you, Corbett,\" he called out, \"I'm considered a\ncounterpuncher. I always--\"\n\nHe was cut off with a sharp left to the face that snapped his head back,\nand his lips curled in a smile of condescension.\n\n\"Good--very good, Corbett.\"\n\nThen with lightning speed and the grace of a cat, Roger slipped inside\nTom's guard, punching hard and true. A left, a right and a left pounded\ninto Tom's mid-section, and as he gave way momentarily Tom's face\nclouded over.\n\nThey circled. Tom kept leading with sharp lefts that popped in and out\nlike a piston, always connecting and keeping Roger off balance. Roger\nconcentrated on penetrating Tom's defense, methodically pounding his\nribs and heart and trying to wear him down.\n\n\"Time!\" bawled Astro.\n\nThe two boys dropped their hands and turned back to their corners. They\nsquatted on the floor breathing slowly and easily. Astro stood in the\nmiddle of the ring, glaring at both of them in turn and shaking his\nhead.\n\n\"Huh. I expected to see you two try to wallop each other into meteor\ndust! Keep fighting like that and we'll be here all night!\"\n\n\"Talk to Corbett,\" sneered Roger. \"Looks like he's afraid to mix it up!\"\n\n\"You fight your way, Roger, and I'll fight mine,\" replied Tom, his voice\ncold and impersonal.\n\n\"Time!\" suddenly yelled Astro and stepped back off the mat.\n\nThe two cadets jumped to their feet and met in the center of the ring\nagain. With a bull-like rush, Roger changed tactics and began to rain\npunches all over Tom's body, but the curly-haired cadet stood his ground\ncoolly, picking some off in mid-air with his gloves and sliding under\nthe others. Then, as Roger slowed down, Tom took the offensive, popping\nhis left into his opponent's face steadily and methodically, while\nkeeping his right cocked for a clear opening to the chin.\n\nRoger danced in and out, watching Tom's left as though it was a snake\nand trying unsuccessfully to get through his guard. But the sharp lefts\nkept snapping his head back and his face began to redden, not only from\nthe sting of the blows but with the mounting fury of his frustration.\n\nSuddenly, as Astro raised his arm to call time for the end of the round,\nRoger jumped forward and rained another series of harmless blows on\nTom's shoulders and arms. But then, as the big Venusian called time, he\nstepped back and Tom dropped his guard. Instantly, Roger threw a right\nwith all his weight behind it. It landed flush on Tom's jaw and he\ndropped, sprawling full length on the mats and lying still.\n\nSmiling, Roger sauntered to his corner while Astro charged in and bent\nover the fallen cadet.\n\n\"None of that, Astro!\" snapped Roger. \"Since when does a referee take\nsides? Leave him alone! If he doesn't come out for the next round, you\nhave to count him out!\"\n\nThe big Venusian straightened and walked menacingly toward Roger's\ncorner. \"You hit him after I called time,\" he growled.\n\n\"So I have to take you on too, huh?\" Roger jumped to his feet. \"All\nright--come on, you big blast of space gas!\"\n\n\"Wait, Astro ... wait!\"\n\nAstro suddenly wheeled around to see Tom shaking his head weakly and\ntrying to rise up on his elbows. He rushed back to the fallen boy's\nside.\n\nRoger shouted at him angrily, \"Leave him alone!\"\n\n\"Ahhh--go blow your jets!\" was Astro's snarling reply as he bent over\nTom, who was now sitting up. \"Tom, are you O.K.?\"\n\n\"Yeah--yeah,\" he replied weakly. \"But stay out of this. You're the\nreferee. How much time left?\"\n\n\"Twenty seconds,\" said Astro. \"Roger smacked you after I called time.\"\n\n\"If he did, I didn't know a thing about it. I was out.\" Tom managed a\ncold smile. \"Nice punch, Roger.\"\n\n\"Ten seconds,\" said Astro, stepping back off the mat.\n\n\"Thanks for the compliment, Corbett.\" Roger eyed the other cadet\nspeculatively. \"But are you sure you want to go on?\"\n\n\"I was saved by the bell, wasn't I?\"\n\n\"Yeah--sure--but if you'd rather quit--\"\n\n\"Time!\" cried Astro.\n\nTom rose to his feet--shook his head--and brought up his hands. He\nwasn't a moment too soon. Roger had rushed across the mat, trying to\nland another murderous right. Tom brought up his shoulder just in time,\nslipping with the punch, and at the same time, bringing up a terrific\nleft to Roger's open mid-section. Manning let out a grunt and clinched.\nTom pursued his advantage, pumping rights and lefts to the body, and he\ncould feel the arrogant cadet weakening. Suddenly, Roger crowded in\nclose, wrestling Tom around so that Astro was on the opposite side of\nthe mat, then brought up his head under Tom's chin. The pop of Tom's\nteeth could be heard all over the great hall. Roger quickly stepped\nback, and back-pedaled until Astro called time.\n\n\"Thanks for teaching me that one, Roger. Learned two tricks from you\ntoday,\" said Tom, breathing heavily, but with the same cold smile on his\nface.\n\n\"That's all right, Corbett. Any time,\" said Manning.\n\n\"What tricks?\" asked Astro. He looked suspiciously at Manning, who was\ndoubled over, finding it hard to breath.\n\n\"Nothing I can't handle in time,\" said Tom, looking at Roger.\n\n\"Time!\" called Astro and stepped off the mat.\n\nThe two boys got to their feet slowly. The pace was beginning to show on\nthem and they boxed carefully.\n\nThe boys were perfectly matched, Tom constantly snapping Roger's head\nback with the jolting left jabs and following to the head or heart with\na right cross. And Roger counterpunching, slipping hooks and body\npunches in under Tom's long leads. It was a savage fight. The three\nweeks of hard physical training had conditioned the boys perfectly.\n\nAt the end of the twelfth round, both boys showed many signs of wear.\nRoger's cheeks were as red as the glow of a jet blast deflector from the\nhundreds of lefts Tom had pumped into his face, while Tom's ribs and\nmid-section were bruised and raw where Roger's punches had landed\nsuccessfully.\n\nIt couldn't last much longer, thought Astro, as he called time for the\nbeginning of the thirteenth round.\n\nRoger quickened his pace, dancing in and out, trying to move in under\nTom's lefts, but suddenly Tom caught him with a right hand that was\ncocked and ready. It staggered him and he fell back, covering up. Tom\npressed his advantage, showering rights and lefts everywhere he could\nfind an opening. In desperation, his knees buckling, Roger clinched\ntightly, quickly brought up his open glove and gouged his thumb into\nTom's eyes. Tom pulled back, instinctively pawing at his eye with his\nright glove. Roger, spotting the opening, took immediate advantage of\nit, shooting a hard looping right that landed flush on Tom's jaw. Tom\nwent down.\n\nUnaware of Roger's tactics, Astro jumped into the ring and his arm\npumped the deadly count.\n\n\"One--two--three--four--\"\n\nIt was going to be tough if Roger won, Astro thought, as he counted.\n\n\"Five--six--\"\n\nArrogant enough now, he would be impossible to live with.\n\n\"Seven--eight--\"\n\nTom struggled up to a sitting position and stared angrily at his\nopponent in the far corner.\n\n\"Nine--\"\n\nWith one convulsive effort, Tom regained his feet. His left eye was\nclosed and swollen, his right bleary with fatigue. He wobbled drunkenly\non his feet. But he pressed forward. This was one fight he had to win.\n\nRoger moved in for the finish. He slammed a left into Tom's shell,\ntrying to find an opening for the last finishing blow. But Tom remained\nin his shell, forearms picking off the smashes that even hurt his arms,\nas he waited for the strength to return to his legs and arms and his\nhead to clear. He knew that he couldn't go another round. He wouldn't be\nable to see. It would have to be this round, and he had to _beat_ Roger.\n_Not_ because he wanted to, but because Roger was a member of the unit.\nAnd he had to keep the unit together.\n\nHe circled his unit-mate with care, shielding himself from the shower of\nrights and lefts that rained around him. He waited--waited for the one\nperfect opening.\n\n\"Come on! Open up and fight, Corbett,\" panted Roger.\n\nTom snapped his right in reply. He noticed that Roger moved in with a\nhook every time he tried to cross his right. He waited--his legs began\nto shake. Roger circled and Tom shot out the left again, dropped into a\nsemicrouch and feinted with the right cross. Roger moved in, cocking his\nfist for the left hook and Tom was ready for him. He threw the right,\nthrew it with every ounce of strength left in his body. Roger was caught\nmoving in and took the blow flush on the chin. He stopped as if\npoleaxed. His eyes turned glassy and then he dropped to the mat. He was\nout cold.\n\nAstro didn't even bother to count.\n\nTom squatted on the mat beside Roger and rubbed the blond head with his\nglove.\n\n\"Get some water, Astro,\" he said, gasping for breath. \"I'm glad I don't\nhave to fight this guy again. And I'll tell you something else--\"\n\n\"What?\" asked Astro.\n\n\"Anybody that wants to win as much as this guy does, is going to win,\nand I want to have him on my side!\"\n\nAstro merely grunted as he turned toward the water cooler.\n\n\"Maybe,\" he called back. \"But he ought to read a book of rules first!\"\n\nWhen he came back to the mat with the water, Roger was sitting up,\nbiting the knots of the laces on his gloves. Tom helped him, and when\nthe soggy leather was finally discarded, he stuck out his hand. \"Well,\nRoger, I'm ready to forget everything we've said and start all over\nagain.\"\n\nRoger looked at the extended hand for a moment, his eyes blank and\nexpressionless. Then, with a quick movement, he slapped it away and\nlurched to his feet.\n\n\"Go blow your jets,\" he snarled, and turning his back on them, stumbled\nacross the gym.\n\nTom watched him go, bewilderment and pain mirrored on his face.\n\n\"I thought sure this would work, Astro,\" he sighed. \"I thought he'd come\nto his senses if--\"\n\n\"Nothing'll make that space creep come to his senses,\" Astro broke in\ndisgustedly. \"At least, nothing short of an atomic war head! Come on.\nLet's get you cleaned up!\"\n\nPutting his arm around Tom's shoulder, the big Venusian led him across\nthe floor of the deserted gym, and as they disappeared through the\nautomatic sliding doors, a tall figure in the uniform of the Solar Guard\nstepped out of the shadows on the balcony above. It was Captain Strong.\n\nHe stood silently at the rail, looking down at the mats and the soggy\ndiscarded boxing gloves. Tom had won the fight, he thought, but he had\nlost the war. The unit was now farther apart than it had ever been.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6\n\n\n\"Well, Steve, how's everything going?\"\n\nCaptain Steve Strong didn't answer right away. He returned the salute of\na Space Cadet passing on the opposite slidewalk and then faced Commander\nWalters who stood beside him, eyeing him quizzically.\n\n\"Things are shaping up pretty well, Commander,\" he replied, finally,\nwith an air of unconcern.\n\n\"The Earthworm units buckling down to business?\" Commander Walters'\nvoice matched Strong's in nonchalance.\n\n\"Yes, I'd say so, sir. Speaking generally, of course.\" Strong felt the\nback of his neck begin to flush as Walters kept eyeing him.\n\n\"And--speaking specifically, Steve?\"\n\n\"Why--ah--what do you mean, sir?\"\n\n\"Let's stop fencing with each other, Steve.\" Walters spoke kindly but\nfirmly. \"What about Manning and Unit 42-D? Are those boys learning to\nwork together or not? And I want facts, not hopes!\"\n\nStrong hesitated, trying to word his reply. In these weeks that had\nfollowed Tom's fight with Roger in the gym, there had been no further\nincidents of open warfare. Roger's attitude, once openly defiant, had\nnow subsided into a stream of never-ending sarcasm. The sting had been\ntaken out of his attack and he seemed satisfied merely to annoy. Astro\nhad withdrawn into a shell, refusing to allow Roger to bother him and\nonly an occasional rumble of anger indicated his true feelings toward\nhis troublesome unit-mate. Tom maintained his role of peacemaker and\ndaily, in many ways, showed his capacity for leadership by steering his\nunit-mates away from any storm-provoking activities.\n\nStrong finally broke the silence. \"It's difficult to answer that\nquestion with facts, Commander Walters.\"\n\n\"Why?\" insisted Walters.\n\n\"Well, nothing's really happened,\" answered Steve.\n\n\"You mean, nothing since the fight in the gym?\"\n\n\"Oh--\" Strong flushed. \"You know about that?\"\n\nCommander Walters smiled. \"Black eyes and faces that looked like raw\nbeef don't go unnoticed, Steve.\"\n\n\"Uhh--no, sir,\" was Strong's lame reply.\n\n\"What I want to know is,\" pursued Walters, \"did the fight prove\nanything? Did the boys get it out of their systems and are they\nconcentrating on becoming a unit?\"\n\n\"Right now, Commander, they're concentrating on passing their manuals.\nThey realize that they have to work together to get through this series\nof tests. Why, Dr. Dale told me the other day that she's sure Tom's been\ngiving Roger a few pointers on control-deck operation. And one night I\nfound Manning giving Astro a lecture in compression ratios. Of course,\nManning's way of talking is a way that would confuse the Venusian more\nthan it would help him, but at least they weren't snarling at each\nother.\"\n\n\"Hmm,\" Walters nodded. \"Sounds hopeful, but still not conclusive. After\nall, they have to help each other in the manuals. If one member of the\nunit fails, it will reflect on the marks of the other two and they might\nbe washed out too. Even the deadliest enemies will unite to save their\nlives.\"\n\n\"Perhaps, sir,\" replied Strong. \"But we're not dealing with deadly\nenemies now. These are three boys, with three distinct personalities\nwho've been lumped together in strange surroundings. It takes time and\npatience to make a team that will last for years.\"\n\n\"You may have the patience, Steve, but the Academy hasn't the time.\"\nCommander Walters was suddenly curt. \"When does Unit 42-D take its\nmanuals?\"\n\n\"This afternoon, sir,\" replied Strong. \"I'm on my way over to the\nexamination hall right now.\"\n\n\"Very well. I won't take any action yet. I'll wait for the results of\nthe tests. Perhaps they will solve both our problems. See you later,\nSteve.\" Turning abruptly, Commander Walters stepped off the slidewalk\nonto the steps of the Administration Building and rapidly disappeared\nfrom view.\n\nLeft alone, Strong pondered the commander's parting statement. The\nimplication was clear. If the unit failed to make a grade high enough to\nwarrant the trouble it took keeping it together, it would be broken up.\nOr even worse, one or more of the boys would be dismissed from the\nAcademy.\n\nA few minutes later Strong arrived in the examination hall, a large,\nbarren room with a small door in each of the three walls other than the\none containing the entrance. Tom Corbett was waiting in the center of\nthe hall and saluted smartly as Strong approached.\n\n\"Cadet Corbett reporting for manual examination, sir!\"\n\n\"Stand easy, Corbett,\" replied Strong, returning the salute. \"This is\ngoing to be a rough one. Are you fully prepared?\"\n\n\"I believe so, sir.\" Tom's voice wasn't too steady.\n\nA fleeting smile passed over Strong's lips, then he continued. \"You'll\ntake the control-deck examination first. Manning will be next on the\nradar bridge and Astro last on the power deck.\"\n\n\"They'll be here according to schedule, sir.\"\n\n\"Very well. Follow me.\"\n\nStrong walked quickly to the small door in the left wall, Tom staying a\nrespectful step behind. When they reached the door, the officer pressed\na button in the wall beside it and the door slid open.\n\n\"All right, Corbett. Inside.\" Strong nodded toward the interior of the\nroom.\n\nThe boy stepped in quickly, then stopped in amazement. All around him\nwas a maze of instruments and controls. And in the center, twin pilot's\nchairs.\n\n\"Captain Strong!\" Tom was so surprised that he could hardly get the\nwords out. \"It's--it's a real control deck!\"\n\nStrong smiled. \"As real as we can make it, Corbett, without allowing the\nbuilding to blast off.\" He gestured toward the pilot's chairs. \"Take\nyour place and strap in.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" His eyes still wide with wonder, Tom stepped over to the\nindicated chair and Strong followed him, leaning casually against the\nother.\n\nHe watched the young cadet nervously adjust his seat strap and put a\ncomforting hand on his shoulder. \"Nervous, Corbett?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir--just a little,\" replied Tom.\n\n\"Don't worry,\" said Strong. \"You should have seen the way I came into\nthis room fifteen years ago. My cadet officer had to help me into the\ncontrol pilot's seat.\"\n\nTom managed a fleeting smile.\n\n\"Now, Corbett\"--Strong's voice became businesslike--\"as you know, these\nmanual tests are the last tests before actually blasting off. In the\npast weeks, you cadets have been subjected to every possible\nexamination, to discover any flaw in your work that might later crop up\nin space. This manual operations test of the control board, like\nManning's on the radar bridge and Astro's on the power deck, is designed\nto test you under simulated space conditions. If you pass this test,\nyour next step is real space.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"I warn you, it isn't easy. And if you fail, you personally will wash\nout, and if other members of the unit do not get a high enough mark to\naverage out to a passing grade for all of you, you fail as a unit.\"\n\n\"I understand, sir,\" said Tom.\n\n\"All right, then we'll begin. Your crew is aboard, the air lock is\nclosed. What is the first thing you do?\"\n\n\"Adjust the air circulating system to ensure standard Earth conditions.\"\n\n\"How do you do that?\"\n\n\"By pressing this button which will activate the servo units. They\nautomatically keep the circulating pumps in operation, based on\nthermostatic readings from the main gauge.\" Tom pointed to a black clock\nface, with a luminous white hand and numbers.\n\n\"All right, carry on,\" said Strong.\n\nTom reached over the huge control board that extended around him for\nsome two feet on three sides. He placed a nervous finger on a small\nbutton, waited for the gauge below to register with a swing of the hand,\nand then released it. \"All pressures steady, sir.\"\n\n\"What next?\"\n\n\"Check the crew, sir--all departments--\" replied Tom.\n\n\"Carry on,\" said Strong.\n\nTom reached out and pulled a microphone toward him.\n\n\"All hands! Station check!\" said Tom, and then was startled to hear a\nmetallic voice answer him.\n\n\"Power deck, ready for blast-off!\" And then another voice: \"Radar deck,\nready for blast-off!\"\n\nTom leaned back in the pilot's seat and turned to the captain. \"All\nstations ready, sir.\"\n\n\"Good! What next?\" asked Strong.\n\n\"Ask spaceport tower for blast-off clearance--\"\n\nStrong nodded. Tom turned back to the microphone, and without looking,\npunched a button in front of him.\n\n\"Rocket cruiser--\" He paused and turned back to Strong. \"What name do I\ngive, sir?\"\n\nStrong smiled. \"_Noah's Ark_--\"\n\n\"Rocket cruiser _Noah's Ark_ to spaceport control! Request blast-off\nclearance and orbit.\"\n\nOnce again a thin metallic voice answered him and gave the necessary\ninstructions.\n\nOn and on, through every possible command, condition or decision that\nwould be placed in front of him, Tom guided his imaginary ship on its\nimaginary flight through space. For two hours he pushed buttons, snapped\nswitches and jockeyed controls. He gave orders and received them from\nthe thin metallic voices. They answered him with such accuracy, and\nsometimes with seeming hesitation, that Tom found it difficult to\nbelieve that they were only electronically controlled recording devices.\nOnce, when supposedly blasting through space at three-quarters space\nspeed, he received a warning from the radar bridge of an approaching\nasteroid. He asked for a course change, but in reply received only\nstatic. Believing the recording to have broken down, he turned\ninquiringly to Captain Strong, but received only a blank stare in\nreturn. Tom hesitated for a split second, then turned back to the\ncontrols. He quickly flipped the teleceiver button on and began plotting\nthe course of the approaching asteroid, ignoring for the moment his\nother duties on the control deck. When he had finished, he gave the\ncourse shift to the power deck and ordered a blast on the starboard jet.\nHe waited for the course change, saw it register on the gauges in front\nof him, then continued his work.\n\nStrong suddenly leaned over and clapped him on the back\nenthusiastically.\n\n\"Good work, Corbett. That broken recording was put there intentionally\nto trap you. Not one cadet in twenty would have had the presence of mind\nyou showed in plotting the course of that asteroid yourself.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" stammered Tom.\n\n\"That's all--the test is over. Return to your quarters.\" He came over\nand laid a hand on Tom's shoulder. \"And don't worry, Corbett. While it\nisn't customary to tell a cadet, I think you deserve it. You've passed\nwith a perfect score!\"\n\n\"I have, sir? You mean--_I really passed?_\"\n\n\"Next step is Manning,\" said Strong. \"You've done as much as one cadet\ncan do.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir\"--Tom could only repeat it over and over--\"thank you,\nsir--thank you.\"\n\nDazed, he saluted his superior and turned to the door. Two hours in the\npilot's chair had made him dizzy. But he was happy.\n\nFive minutes later he slammed back the sliding door and entered the\nquarters of 42-D with a lusty shout.\n\n\"Meet Space Cadet Corbett--an Earthworm who's just passed his\ncontrol-deck manual operations exam!\"\n\nAstro looked up from a book of tables on astrogation and gave Tom a wan\nsmile.\n\n\"Congratulations, Tom,\" he said, and turned back to his book, adding\nbitterly, \"but if I don't get these tables down by this afternoon for my\npower-deck manual, you're sunk.\"\n\n\"Say--what's going on here?\" asked Tom. \"Where's Roger? Didn't he help\nyou with them?\"\n\n\"He left. Said he had to see someone before taking his radar-bridge\nmanual. He helped me a little. But when I'd ask him a question, he'd\njust rattle the answer off so fast--well, I just couldn't follow him.\"\n\nSuddenly slamming the book shut, he got up. \"Me and these tables\"--he\nindicated the book--\"just don't mix!\"\n\n\"What's the trouble?\"\n\n\"Ah--I can get the easy ones about astrogation. They're simple. But it's\nthe ones where I have to _combine_ it with the power deck.\"\n\n\"Well--I mean--what specifically?\" asked Tom softly.\n\n\"For instance, I've got to find the ratio for compression on the main\nfiring tubes, using a given amount of fuel, heading for a given\ndestination, and taking a given time for the passage.\"\n\n\"But that's control-deck operations--as well as astrogation and power!\"\nexclaimed Tom.\n\n\"Yeah--I know,\" answered Astro, \"but I've still got to be able to do it.\nIf anything happened to you two guys and I didn't know how to get you\nhome, then what?\"\n\nTom hesitated. Astro was right. Each member of the unit had to depend on\nthe other in any emergency. And if one of them failed...? Tom saw why\nthe ground manuals were so important now.\n\n\"Look,\" offered Tom. \"Suppose we go over the whole thing again together.\nMaybe you're fouled up on the basic concept.\"\n\nTom grabbed a chair, hitched it close to the desk and pulled Astro down\nbeside him. He opened the book and began studying the problem.\n\n\"Now look--you have twenty-two tons of fuel--and considering the\nposition of your ship in space--\"\n\nAs the two boys, their shoulders hunched over the table, began reviewing\nthe table of ratios, across the quadrangle in the examination hall\nRoger Manning stood in a replica of a rocket ship's radar bridge and\nfaced Captain Strong.\n\n\"Cadet Manning reporting for manual examination, sir.\" Roger brought up\nhis arm in a crisp salute to Captain Strong, who returned it casually.\n\n\"Stand easy, Manning,\" replied Strong. \"Do you recognize this room?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. It's a mock-up of a radar bridge.\"\n\n\"A workable mock-up, cadet!\" Strong was vaguely irritated by Roger's\nnonchalance in accepting a situation that Tom had marveled at. \"You will\ntake your manuals here!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"On these tests you will be timed for both efficiency and speed and\nyou'll use all the tables, charts and astrogation equipment that you'd\nfind in a spaceship. Your problems are purely mathematical. There are no\ndecisions to make. Just use your head.\"\n\nStrong handed Roger several sheets of paper containing written problems.\nRoger shuffled them around in his fingers, giving each a quick glance.\n\n\"You may begin any time you are ready, Manning,\" said Strong.\n\n\"I'm ready now, sir,\" replied Roger calmly. He turned to the swivel\nchair located between the huge communications board, the adjustable\nchart table and the astrogation prism. Directly in front of him was the\nhuge radar scanner, and to one side and overhead was a tube mounted on a\nswivel joint that looked like a small telescope, but which was actually\nan astrogation prism for taking sights on the celestial bodies in space.\n\nRoger concentrated on the first problem.\n\n\" ... you are now in the northwest quadrant of Mars, chart M, area\ntwenty-eight. You have been notified by the control deck that it has\nbeen necessary to jettison three quarters of your fuel supply. For the\nlast five hundred and seventy-nine seconds you have been blasting at\none-quarter space speed. The four main drive rockets were cut out at\nthirty-second intervals. Making adjustment for degree of slip on each\nsuccessive rocket cutout, find present position by using cross-fix with\nRegulus as your starboard fix, Alpha Centauri as your port fix.\"\n\nSuddenly a bell began to ring in front of Roger. Without hesitation he\nadjusted a dial that brought the radar scanner into focus. When the\nscreen remained blank, he made a second adjustment, and then a third and\nfourth, until the bright white flash of a meteor was seen on the\nscanner. He quickly grabbed two knobs, one in each hand, and twisted\nthem to move two thin, plotting lines, one horizontal and one vertical,\nacross the surface of the scanner. Setting the vertical line, he\nfingered a tabulating machine with his right hand, as he adjusted the\nsecond line with his left, thus cross-fixing the meteor. Then he turned\nhis whole attention to the tabulator, ripped off the answer with\nlightning moves of his fingers and began talking rapidly into the\nmicrophone.\n\n\"Radar bridge to control deck! Alien body bearing zero-one-five,\none-point-seven degrees over plane of the ecliptic. On intersecting\norbit. Change course two degrees, hold for fifteen seconds, then resume\noriginal heading. Will compensate for change nearer destination!\"\n\nRoger watched the scanner a moment longer. When the rumbling blast of\nthe steering jets sounded in the chamber and the meteor flash shifted on\nthe scanner screen, he returned to the problem in his hand.\n\nSeven minutes later he turned to Strong and handed him the answer.\n\n\"Present position by dead reckoning is northwest quadrant of Mars,\nchart O, area thirty-nine, sir,\" he announced confidently.\n\n[Illustration: \"_I was unable to get a sight on Alpha Centauri_\"]\n\nStrong tried to mask his surprise, but a lifted eyebrow gave him away.\n\"And how did you arrive at this conclusion, Manning?\"\n\n\"I was unable to get a sight on Alpha Centauri due to the present\nposition of Jupiter, sir,\" replied Roger easily. \"So I took a fix on\nEarth, allowed for its rotational speed around the sun and took the\ncross-fix with Regulus as ordered in the problem. Of course, I included\nall the other factors of the speed and heading of our ship. That was\nroutine.\"\n\nStrong accepted the answer with a curt nod, motioning for Roger to\ncontinue. It would not do, thought Strong, to let Manning know that he\nwas the first cadet in thirty-nine years to make the correct selection\nof Earth in working up the fix with Regulus, and still have the presence\nof mind to plot a meteor without so much as a half-degree error. Of\ncourse the problem varied with each cadet, but it remained essentially\nthe same.\n\n\"Seven-and-a-half minutes. Commander Walters will be surprised, to say\nthe least,\" thought Steve.\n\nForty-five minutes later, Roger, as unruffled as if he had been sitting\nlistening to a lecture from a sound slide, handed in the rest of his\npapers, executed a sharp salute and walked out.\n\n\"Two down and one to go,\" thought Strong, and the toughest one of them\nall coming up. Astro. The big Venusian was unable to understand anything\nthat couldn't be turned with a wrench. The only thing that would prevent\nUnit 42-D from taking Academy unit honors over Unit 77-K, the unit\nassigned to Lieutenant Wolcheck, would be Astro. While none of the\nmembers of the other units could come up to the individual brilliance of\nCorbett or Manning, they worked together as a unit, helping one another.\nThey might make a higher unit rating, simply because they were better\nbalanced.\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders and collected the papers. It was as much\ntorture for him, as it was for any cadet, he thought, and turned to the\ndoor. \"All right, Astro,\" he said to himself, \"in ten minutes it'll be\nyour turn and I'm going to make it tough!\"\n\nBack in the quarters of Unit 42-D, Tom and Astro still pored over the\nbooks and papers on the desk.\n\n\"Let's try again, Astro,\" sighed Tom as he hitched his chair closer to\nthe desk. \"You've got thirty tons of fuel--you want to find the\ncompression ratio of the number-one firing-tube chamber--so what do you\ndo?\"\n\n\"Start up the auxiliary, burn a little of the stuff and judge what it'll\nbe,\" the big cadet replied. \"That's the way I did it on the space\nfreighters.\"\n\n\"But you're not on a space freighter now!\" exclaimed Tom. \"You've got to\ndo things the way they want it done here at the Academy. By the book!\nThese tables have been figured out by great minds to help you, and you\njust want to burn a little of the stuff and guess at what it'll be!\" Tom\nthrew up his hands in disgust.\n\n\"Seems to me I heard of an old saying back in the teen centuries about\nleading a horse to water, but not being able to make him drink!\" drawled\nRoger from the doorway. He strolled in and kicked at the crumpled sheets\nof paper that littered the floor, stark evidence of Tom's efforts with\nAstro.\n\n\"All right, wise guy,\" said Tom, \"suppose you explain it to him!\"\n\n\"No can do,\" replied Roger. \"I tried. I explained it to him twenty times\nthis morning while you were taking your control-deck manual.\" He tapped\nhis head delicately with his forefinger. \"Can't get through--too thick!\"\n\nAstro turned to the window to hide the mist in his eyes.\n\n\"Lay off, Roger,\" snapped Tom. He got up and walked over to the big\ncadet. \"Come on, Astro, we haven't got much time. You're due in the\nexamination hall in a few minutes.\"\n\n\"It's no good, Tom, I just can't understand that stuff.\" Astro turned\nand faced his unit-mates, his voice charged with sudden emotion. \"Just\nfifteen minutes on the power deck of anything with rockets in her and\nI'll run her from here to the next galaxy. I--I can't explain it, but\nwhen I look at those motors, I can read 'em like you read an astrogation\nchart, Roger, or you the gauges on the control deck, Tom. But I just\ncan't get those ratios out of a book. I gotta put my hands on those\nmotors--touch 'em--I mean really _touch 'em_--then I know what to do!\"\n\nAs suddenly as he had started, he stopped and turned, leaving Tom and\nRoger staring at him, startled by this unusual outburst.\n\n\"Cadets--stand _to!_\" roared a voice from the doorway.\n\nThe three cadets snapped to attention and faced the entrance.\n\n\"Take it easy, Earthworms!\" said Tony Richards. A tall cadet with\nclosely cut black hair and a lazy, smiling face stood in the doorway.\n\n\"Lay off, Richards,\" said Tom. \"We haven't time for gags now. Astro's\ngoing to take his power-deck manual in a few minutes and we're cramming\nwith him.\"\n\n\"O.K.--O.K.--don't blow your jets,\" said Richards. \"I just wanted to see\nif there were any bets on which unit would cop honors in the manuals\nthis afternoon.\"\n\n\"I suppose you think your Unit 77-K will finish on top?\" drawled Roger.\n\n\"I'd like to bet all the galley demerits we have in 77-K against yours.\"\n\n\"With Astro on our team?\" complained Roger.\n\n\"What's the matter with Astro?\" asked Richards. \"From what I hear, he's\nhot stuff!\" It wasn't a compliment, but a sharp dig made with a sly\nsmile. Astro balled his huge hands into fists.\n\n\"Astro,\" said Roger, \"is the type that can smell out trouble on any\npower deck. But today he came down with a cold. No, I'm afraid it's no\nbet, Richards.\"\n\n\"I'll give you two to one,\" Richards offered.\n\n\"Nothing doing,\" replied Roger. \"Not even at five to one. Not with\nAstro.\"\n\nRichards grinned, nodded and disappeared.\n\nRoger turned to face the hard stare of Tom.\n\n\"That was the dirtiest sellout I've ever heard, Manning,\" Tom growled.\n\n\"Sorry, Corbett,\" said Roger. \"I only bet on sure things.\"\n\n\"That's O.K. with me, Manning,\" said Astro, \"but I'm afraid you sold\nyourself a hot rocket, because I'm going to pass!\"\n\n\"Who are you kidding?\" Roger laughed and sprawled on his bunk.\n\nAstro took a quick step forward, his fists clenched, his face a mask of\nburning anger, but Tom quickly jumped in front of him.\n\n\"You'll be late for the exam, Astro!\" he shouted. \"Get going or it'll\ncount against your mark!\"\n\n\"Huh. What's a few points more or less when you're going to fail\nanyway,\" snorted Roger from the bunk.\n\nAgain, Astro started to lunge forward and Tom braced himself against the\nVenusian's charge, but suddenly the burly cadet stopped. Disengaging\nTom's restraining arms, he spoke coldly to the sneering boy on the bed.\n\n\"I'm going to pass the exam, Manning. Get that? I'm going to pass and\nthen come back and beat your head off!\" Turning on his heel, he stalked\nout of the room.\n\nTom immediately wheeled to face Roger, fire in his eyes, and the\narrogant cadet, sensing trouble, jumped to his feet to meet him.\n\n\"What's the idea of giving Astro a hard time?\" demanded Tom.\n\n\"Cool off, Corbett,\" replied Roger warily. \"You're fusing your tubes\nyou're so hot.\"\n\n\"You bet I'm hot! Hot enough to blast you--again!\" Tom deliberately spat\nout the last word.\n\nRoger flushed and brought his fists up quickly as though to charge in,\nthen suddenly dropped them again. He turned to the door and slowly\nwalked out.\n\n\"Go blow your jets,\" his voice drifted back to Tom as he disappeared.\n\nTom stood there, looking at the empty door, almost blind with rage and\nfrustration. He was failing in the main job assigned to him, that of\nkeeping the unit on an even keel and working together. How could he\ncommand a crew out in space if he couldn't keep the friction of his own\nunit under control?\n\nSlowly, he left the room to wait for Astro in the recreation hall where\nthe results of the manuals would be announced. He thought of Astro, now\nprobably deep in his exam, and wondered how bad it would be for him.\nThen another thought crossed his mind. Roger had said nothing of his own\ntest and neither he nor Astro had even inquired.\n\nHe shook his head. No matter where the unit placed in the manuals, it\njust couldn't stay together.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7\n\n\nIt was customary for all Earthworm cadets to gather in the main\nrecreation hall to wait for the results of the manuals which would be\nannounced on the huge teleceiver screen. Since all the units were taking\ntheir tests that afternoon, the hall was crowded with green-clad cadets,\ntalking in low murmurs and waiting tensely for the outcome of the exam.\n\nTom entered the huge room, looked around and then drifted toward Al\nDixon, the senior cadet who had greeted them as a unit after passing\nclassification tests. The blue-clad cadet was listening to a story\nspool, a device that told a story, rather than let the person read it\nfrom a book.\n\n\"Hiya, Corbett,\" said Dixon, smiling. \"Drag up a chair. Listening to a\nterrific yarn about a guy stranded on an asteroid and then he finds--\"\nThe redheaded cadet's voice trailed off when he noticed that Tom wasn't\nlistening.\n\n\"Say, what's the matter with you? You look like you just lost your best\nfriend.\"\n\n\"Not yet, but it won't be long now,\" commented Tom, a trace of\nbitterness creeping into his voice. \"Astro's taking his power-deck\nmanual. What he knows about those compression ratios just isn't known.\nBut he just can't get it on paper.\"\n\n\"Don't sell your unit-mate short,\" said Dixon, sensing something\nbeneath Tom's comment. \"I've heard that big fellow knows more about a\nrocket deck than McKenny.\"\n\n\"Yeah, that's true,\" said Tom, \"but--\"\n\n\"You know, Corbett,\" said Dixon, switching off the story spool, \"there's\nsomething screwy in that outfit of yours.\"\n\n\"You can say that again,\" agreed Tom bitterly.\n\n\"You come in here with a face dragging on the floor, and Manning--\"\n\nTom's head jerked up. \"Manning! What about that space-gassing hot-shot?\"\n\n\"--Manning just tore through the rec hall trying to get some of the\nother Earthworm units to bet their galley demerits against your outfit.\"\n\nTom's mouth sagged open. \"You mean, he actually wanted to bet that Astro\nwould pass?\"\n\n\"Not just pass, Corbett, but he wanted to bet that your unit would be\ntop rocket of the Earthworms! The head of the list!\"\n\n\"But he told Astro that--\" he stopped.\n\n\"Told him what?\" Dixon asked.\n\n\"Ah--nothing--nothing--\" said Tom. He jumped up and headed for the door.\n\n\"Hey, where are you going?\"\n\n\"To find Manning. There are a couple of things I want to clear up.\"\n\nTom left Dixon shaking his head in bewilderment and jumped on the\nslidestairs. He was going to have it out with Roger once and for all.\nHopping off the slidestairs onto the forty-second floor, he started down\nthe long hall to his quarters.\n\nNearing the door, he heard Roger's laugh, and then his lazy voice\ntalking to someone inside.\n\n\"Sure, they're dumb, but they're not bad guys,\" said Roger.\n\nTom walked into the room. Roger was sitting on the side of his bunk\nfacing Tony Richards.\n\n\"Hiya, Corbett,\" said Roger, \"did you hear how Astro made out yet?\"\n\nTom ignored the question.\n\n\"I want to talk to you, Roger.\"\n\nRoger eyed him suspiciously. \"Sure, Corbett, go ahead.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll be going along,\" said Richards. He had heard about the\nprevious fight between Manning and Corbett and didn't want to be hauled\nup as a witness later if they started again. \"Remember, Manning,\" he\ncalled from the doorway, \"the bet is two to one, and are you going to\nget tired of washing pots and pans!\" He waved his hand at Corbett and\ndisappeared.\n\n\"All right, Corbett,\" Roger turned to Tom. \"What's frying you?\"\n\n\"I just saw Al Dixon down in the rec hall,\" answered Tom. \"He told me\nyou were looking for bets on the unit ratings. Is that why Richards was\nhere?\"\n\n\"That's right,\" nodded Roger.\n\n\"What made you say the things you did to Astro before he went for his\nmanual?\"\n\n\"Very simple. I wanted to make him pass and that was the only way.\"\n\n\"You're pretty sure of yourself, Roger.\"\n\n\"I'm always sure of myself, Corbett. And the sooner you learn that, the\neasier it'll be for all of us. I never bet unless it's in the bag. I\nknow Astro's going to pass. Some guys have to have a fire built under\nthem before they get moving. Astro's one of them.\"\n\n\"That doesn't answer my question,\" said Tom. \"Why did you say the things\nyou did before a guy goes to take an exam?\"\n\n\"I said what I did to make Tony Richards give me odds. _And_ to make\nAstro mad enough to pass. We're a cinch to win and Richards' outfit\nwill be indebted to us for a year's worth of galley demerits.\" He smiled\neasily. \"Smooth, huh?\"\n\n\"I think it's rotten,\" said Tom. \"Astro left here feeling like a plugged\ncredit! And if he does fail, it'll be because you made him think he was\nthe dumbest guy in the universe!\"\n\n\"He probably is,\" mused Roger, \"but he still won't fail that manual.\"\n\nFrom the hallway behind them, a loud blasting yell was suddenly heard,\nechoing from somewhere on the lower floors. Tom and Roger waited, their\neyes wide and hopeful. There was only one person at Space Academy\ncapable of making such a noise.\n\n\"He made it!\" Tom exclaimed.\n\n\"Of course he made it,\" said Roger casually.\n\nAstro tore into 42-D with a mad rush.\n\n\"Yeeeoooooowwww!\" He grabbed the two cadets and picked them up, one in\neach hand. \"I made it--hands down--I handled those rocket motors like\nthey were babes in arms! I told you that all I had to do was touch them\nand I'd know! I told you!\"\n\n\"Congratulations, Astro,\" said Tom with a wide grin. \"I knew you'd do\nit.\"\n\n\"Put me down, you oversized Venusian jerk,\" said Roger, almost\ngood-naturedly. Astro released the smaller cadet and faced him.\n\n\"Well, hot-shot, I promised you something when I got back, didn't I?\"\n\n\"Make it later, will you, and I'll be glad to oblige.\" He walked toward\nthe door. \"I've got to go down and collect a bet.\"\n\n\"What bet?\" asked Astro.\n\n\"With Tony Richards.\"\n\n\"But I thought you were afraid to bet on me!\"\n\n\"Not at all, Astro. I just wanted to make you mad enough to ensure my\nwinning.\"\n\n\"That sounds like you were more worried about your bet than you were\nabout Astro passing,\" snapped Tom.\n\n\"You're exactly right, spaceboy,\" purred Roger, standing in the doorway.\n\n\"That's our boy, Manning,\" growled Astro. \"The great team man!\"\n\n\"Team?\" Roger took a step back into the room. \"Don't make me laugh,\nAstro. For your information, tomorrow morning I'm putting in for a\ntransfer to another unit!\"\n\n\"What!\" exclaimed Tom. \"You can't trans--\"\n\n\"Yes, I can,\" interrupted Roger. \"Read your Academy regs. Anyone can\nrequest a transfer once the unit has passed its manuals.\"\n\n\"And what excuse are you going to use,\" snapped Astro bitterly. \"That\nyou can't take it?\"\n\n\"A personality difference, Astro, my boy. You hate me and I hate you.\nIt's a good enough reason, I think.\"\n\n\"It's just as well, hot-shot,\" replied Astro. \"Because if you don't\ntransfer, we will!\"\n\nRoger merely smiled, flipped his fingers to his forehead in an arrogant\ngesture of farewell and turned to leave again. But his path was blocked\nby the sudden appearance of Captain Steve Strong. The three cadets\nquickly braced.\n\nThe Solar Guard officer strode into the room, his face beaming. He\nlooked at each of the boys, pride shining out of his eyes, and then\nbrought his hand up and held it in salute.\n\n\"I just want to tell you boys one thing,\" he said solemnly. \"It's the\nhighest compliment I can pay you, or anyone.\" He paused. \"All three of\nyou are real spacemen!\"\n\nTom and Astro couldn't repress smiles, but Roger's expression never\nchanged.\n\n\"Then we passed as a unit, sir?\" asked Tom eagerly.\n\n\"Not only passed, Corbett\"--Strong's voice boomed in the small\nroom--\"but with honors. You're the top rockets of this Earthworm group!\nI'm proud to be your commanding officer!\"\n\nAgain Tom and Astro fought back smiles of happiness and even Roger\nmanaged a small grin.\n\n\"This is the fightingest group of cadets I've ever seen,\" Strong\ncontinued. \"Frankly, I was a little worried about your ability to pull\ntogether but the results of the manuals showed that you have. You\ncouldn't have made it without working as a unit.\"\n\nStrong failed to notice Roger's face darken, and Tom and Astro look at\neach other meaningfully.\n\n\"My congratulations for having solved that problem too!\" Strong saluted\nthem again and walked toward the door, where he paused. \"By the way, I\nwant you to report to the Academy spaceport tomorrow at eight hundred\nhours. Warrant Officer McKenny has something out there he wants to show\nyou.\"\n\nTom's eyes bugged out and he stepped forward.\n\n\"Sir,\" he gasped, scarcely able to get the question past his lips, \"you\ndon't mean we're--we're going to--\"\n\n\"You're absolutely right, Corbett. There's a brand-new rocket cruiser\nout there. Your ship. Your future classroom. You'll report to her in the\nblues of the Space Cadets! And from now on your unit identification is\nthe name of your ship! The rocket cruiser _Polaris_!\"\n\nA second later, Strong had vanished down the corridor, leaving Tom and\nAstro hugging each other and clapping each other on the back in\ndelirious joy.\n\nRoger merely stood to one side, a sarcastic smile on his face.\n\n\"And now, as we prepare to face the unknown dangers of space,\" he said\nbitingly, \"let us unite our voices and sing the Academy hymn together!\nHuh!\" He strode toward the door. \"Don't they ever get tired of waving\nthat flag around here?\"\n\nBefore Tom and Astro could reply, he had disappeared. The big Venusian\nshrugged his shoulders. \"I just don't understand that guy!\"\n\nBut Tom failed to reply. He had turned toward the window and was staring\nout past the gleaming white Tower of Galileo into the slowly darkening\nskies of evening to the east. For the moment, the problems of Roger\nManning and the unit were far away. He was thinking of the coming\nmorning when he would dress in the blues of a Space Cadet for the first\ntime and step into his own ship as command pilot. He was thinking of the\nmorning when he would be a real spaceman!\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 8\n\n\nThe campus of Space Academy was quiet that evening. Only a few cadets\nwere still out on the quadrangle, lounging around in the open before\nreturning to their quarters for bed-check.\n\nOn the forty-second floor of the dormitory building, two thirds of the\nnewly formed _Polaris_ unit, Tom and Astro, were in heated argument.\n\n\"All right, all right, so the guy is brilliant,\" said Astro. \"But who\ncan live with him? Not even himself!\"\n\n\"Maybe he is a little difficult,\" replied Tom, \"but somehow, we've got\nto adjust to him!\"\n\n\"How about him adjusting to us? It's two against one!\" Astro shambled to\nthe window and looked out moodily. \"Besides, he's putting in for a\ntransfer and there's nothing we can do about it!\"\n\n\"Maybe he won't now--not after that little speech Captain Strong made\nthis afternoon.\"\n\n\"If he doesn't, then, blast it, I will!\"\n\n\"Aw, now take it easy, Astro!\"\n\n\"Take it easy, nothing!\" Astro was building up a big head of steam.\n\"Where is that space crawler right now?\"\n\n\"I don't know. He never came back. Wasn't even down at mess tonight.\"\n\n\"There, that's just what I mean!\" Astro turned to Tom to press his\npoint. \"It's close to bed-check and he isn't in quarters yet. If the\nMP's catch him outside after hours, the whole unit will be logged and\nthere goes our chance of blasting off tomorrow!\"\n\n\"But there's still time, Astro,\" replied Tom lamely.\n\n\"Not much there isn't. It just shows you what he thinks of the unit! He\njust doesn't care!\" Astro paced the floor angrily. \"There's only one\nthing to do! He gets his transfer--or we do! Or--\" he paused and looked\nat Tom meaningfully, \"or I do.\"\n\n\"You're not thinking, Astro,\" argued Tom. \"How will that look on your\nrecord? Every time there's a trip into deep space, they yank out your\nfile to see how you operate under pressure with other guys. When they\nsee that you asked for a transfer from your unit, that's it!\"\n\n\"Yeah--yeah--I know--incompatible--but honest, Tom--\"\n\nThe curly-haired cadet felt his big friend weaken and he pressed his\nadvantage.\n\n\"It isn't every day that a unit gets a ship right after finishing ground\nmanuals. Captain Strong said he waited for four months after manuals\nbefore getting his first hop into space.\"\n\n\"Yeah--but what do you think it's going to be like out in space with\nManning making sour cracks all the time?\"\n\nTom hesitated before answering his Venusian friend. He was fully aware\nthat Roger was going to play a lone hand. And that they would never\nreally have unity among them until some drastic measure was taken. After\nall, Tom thought, some guys don't have good hearts, or eyes, a defect to\nprevent them from becoming spacemen. Roger is just mixed up inside. And\nthe handicap is just as real as if he had a physical flaw.\n\n\"Well, what do you want to do?\" asked Tom finally.\n\n\"Go see Captain Strong. Give it to him straight. Tell him we want a\ntransfer.\"\n\n\"But tomorrow we blast off. We might not have another chance for months!\nCertainly not until we get a new astrogator.\"\n\n\"I'd rather wait and have a guy on the radar bridge I know isn't going\nto pull something behind my back,\" said Astro, \"than blast off tomorrow\nwith Manning aboard.\"\n\nAgain Tom hesitated. He knew what Astro was saying was the truth. Life,\nso far, at the Academy had been tough enough, but with mutual dependence\nand security even more important out in space, the danger of their\nconstant friction was obvious.\n\n\"O.K.,\" he relented, \"if that's the way you really want it. Come on.\nWe'll go see Captain Strong now.\"\n\n\"You go,\" said Astro. \"You know how I feel. Whatever you say goes for me\ntoo.\"\n\n\"Are you sure you want to do it?\" asked Tom. He knew what such a request\nwould mean. A black mark against Roger for being rejected by his\nunit-mates and a black mark against Astro and himself for not being able\nto adjust. Regardless of who was right and who was wrong, there would\nalways be a mark on their records.\n\n\"Look, Tom,\" said Astro, \"if I thought it was only me I'd keep my mouth\nshut. But you'd let Manning get away with murder because you wouldn't\nwant to be the one to get him into trouble.\"\n\n\"No, I wouldn't,\" said Tom. \"I think Roger would make a fine spaceman;\nhe's certainly smart enough, and a good unit-mate if he'd only snap out\nof it. But I can't let him or anyone else stop me from becoming a\nspaceman or a member of the Solar Guard.\"\n\n\"Then you'll go see Captain Strong?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Tom. If he had been in doubt before, now that he had made\nthe decision, he felt relieved. He slipped on his space boots and stood\nup. The two boys looked at each other, each realizing the question in\nthe other's mind.\n\n\"No!\" said Tom decisively. \"It's better for everyone. Even Roger. He\nmight find two other guys that will fit him better.\" He walked from the\nroom.\n\nThe halls were silent as he strode toward the slidestairs that would\ntake him to the nineteenth floor and Captain Strong's quarters. Passing\none room after another, he glanced in and saw other units studying,\npreparing for bed, or just sitting around talking. There weren't many\nunits left. The tests had taken a toll of the Earthworms. But those that\nremained were solidly built. Already friendships had taken deep root.\nTom found himself wishing he had become a member of another unit. Where\nthe comradeship was taken for granted in other units, he was about to\nmake a request to dissolve his because of friction.\n\nCompletely discouraged, Tom stepped on the slidestairs and started down.\n\nAs he left the dormitory floors, the noise of young cadet life was soon\nlost and he passed floors containing offices and apartments of the\nadministration staff of the Solar Guard.\n\nAs he drew level with the floor that was Galaxy Hall, he glanced at the\nlighted plaque and for the hundredth time reread the inscription--\n\n\" ... to the brave men who sacrificed their lives in the conquest of\nspace, this Galaxy Hall is dedicated....\"\n\nSomething moved in the darkness of the hall. Tom strained his eyes for a\ncloser look and just managed to distinguish the figure of a cadet\nstanding before the wreckage of the _Space Queen_. Funny, thought Tom.\nWhy should anyone be wandering around the hall at this time of night?\nAnd then, as the floor slipped past, the figure turned slightly and was\nilluminated by the dim light that came from the slidestairs. Tom\nrecognized the sharp features and close-cropped blond hair of Roger\nManning!\n\n[Illustration: _Roger was still standing in front of the_ Space Queen!]\n\nQuickly changing over to the slidestairs going up, Tom slipped back to\nthe hall floor and stepped off. Roger was still standing in front of the\n_Space Queen_!\n\nTom started to speak, but stopped when he saw Roger take out a\nhandkerchief and dab at his eyes.\n\nThe movements of the other boy were crystal-clear to Tom. Roger was\ncrying! Standing in front of the _Space Queen_ and crying!\n\nHe kept watching as Roger put away the handkerchief, saluted sharply and\nturned toward the slidestairs. Ducking behind a glass case that held the\nfirst space suit ever used, Tom held his breath as Roger passed him. He\ncould hear Roger mumble.\n\n\"They got you--but they won't get me with any of that glory stuff!\"\n\nTom waited, heart racing, trying to figure out what Roger meant, and why\nhe was here alone in Galaxy Hall. Finally the blond cadet disappeared up\nthe moving stair.\n\nTom didn't go to see Captain Strong. Instead, he returned to his room.\n\n\"So quick?\" asked Astro.\n\nTom shook his head. \"Where's Roger?\" he asked.\n\n\"In the shower.\" Astro gestured to the bathroom, where Tom could hear\nthe sound of running water. \"What made you change your mind about seeing\nCaptain Strong?\" asked Astro.\n\n\"I think we've misjudged Roger, Astro,\" said Tom slowly. And then\nrelated what he had seen and heard.\n\n\"Well, blast my jets!\" exclaimed Astro, when Tom had finished. \"What's\nbehind it, do you think?\"\n\n\"I don't know, Astro. But I'm convinced that any guy that'll visit\nGalaxy Hall by himself late at night--and _cry_--well, he couldn't be\nentirely off base, regardless of what he does.\"\n\nAstro studied his work-hardened palms.\n\n\"You wanta keep it this way for a while?\" he asked. \"I mean, forget\nabout talking to Captain Strong?\"\n\n\"Roger's the best astrogator and radar man in the Academy, Astro.\nThere's something bothering him. But I'm willing to bet that whatever it\nis, Roger will work it out. And if we're really unit-mates, then we\nwon't sell him out now, when he may need us most.\"\n\n\"That's it, then,\" said Astro. \"I'll kill him with kindness. Come on.\nLet's turn in. We've got a big day ahead of us tomorrow!\"\n\nThe two boys began to prepare for bed. Roger came out of the shower\nwearing pajamas.\n\n\"All excited, spacemen?\" he drawled, leaning against the wall, brushing\nhis short hair.\n\n\"About as excited as we can get, Roger,\" smiled Tom.\n\n\"Yeah, you space-blasting jerk!\" growled Astro good-naturedly. \"Turn\nout the lights before I introduce you to my space boot.\"\n\nRoger eyed the two cadets quizzically, puzzled by the strange good humor\nof both boys. He shrugged his shoulders, flipped out the light and\ncrawled into bed.\n\nBut if he could have seen the satisfied smile of Tom Corbett, Roger\nwould have been even more puzzled.\n\n\"We'll just kill him with kindness,\" thought Tom, and fell fast asleep.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 9\n\n\nThe three members of the _Polaris_ unit stepped off the slidewalk at the\nAcademy spaceport and stood before Warrant Officer McKenny.\n\n\"There she is,\" said the stubby spaceman, pointing to the gleaming\nspaceship resting not two hundred feet away. \"Rocket cruiser _Polaris_.\nThe newest and fastest ship in space.\"\n\nHe faced the three boys with a smile. \"And she's all yours. You earned\nher!\"\n\nMouths open, Tom, Roger and Astro stood gaping in fascination at the\nmighty spaceship resting on the concrete ramp. Her long two-hundred-foot\npolished beryllium steel hull mirrored the spaceport scene around them.\nThe tall buildings of the Academy, the \"ready\" line of space destroyers\nand scouts, and the hundreds of maintenance noncoms of the enlisted\nSolar Guard, their scarlet uniforms spotted with grime, were all\nreflected back to the _Polaris_ unit as they eyed the sleek ship from\nthe needlelike nose of her bow to the stubby opening of her rocket\nexhausts. Not a seam or rivet could be seen in her hull. At the top of\nthe ship, near her nose, a large blister made of six-inch clear crystal\nindicated the radar bridge. Twelve feet below it, six round window ports\nshowed the position of the control deck. Surrounding the base of the\nship was an aluminum scaffold with a ladder over a hundred feet high\nanchored to it. The top rung of the ladder just reached the power-deck\nemergency hatch which was swung open, like a giant plug, revealing the\nthickness of the hull, nearly a foot.\n\n\"Well,\" roared the red-clad spaceman, \"don't you want to climb aboard\nand see what your ship looks like inside?\"\n\n\"Do we!\" cried Tom, and made a headlong dash for the scaffold. Astro let\nout one of his famous yells and followed right at his heels. Roger\nwatched them running ahead and started off at a slow walk, but suddenly,\nno longer able to resist, he broke into a dead run. Those around the\n_Polaris_ stopped their work to watch the three cadets scramble up the\nladder. Most of the ground crew were ex-spacemen like McKenny, no longer\nable to blast off because of acceleration reaction. And they smiled\nknowingly, remembering their reactions to their first spaceship.\n\nInside the massive cruiser, the boys roamed over every deck, examining\nthe ship excitedly.\n\n\"Say look at this!\" cried Tom. He stood in front of the control board\nand ran his hands over the buttons and switches. \"This board makes the\nmanual we worked on at the Academy look like it's ready for Galaxy\nHall!\"\n\n\"Yeeeooooooww!\" Three decks below, Astro had discovered the rocket\nmotors. Four of the most powerful ever installed on a spaceship,\nenabling the _Polaris_ to outrace any ship in space.\n\nRoger stuck his head through the radar-bridge hatch and gazed in awe at\nthe array of electronic communicators, detection radar and astrogation\ngear. With lips pulled into a thin line, he mumbled to himself: \"Too bad\nthey didn't give _you_ this kind of equipment.\"\n\n\"What'd you say, Roger?\" asked Astro, climbing alongside to peer into\nthe radar bridge.\n\nStartled, Roger turned and stammered, \"Ah--nothing--nothing.\"\n\nLooking around, Astro commented, \"This place looks almost as good as\nthat power deck.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Roger, \"they could have placed that astrogation prism\na little closer to the chart table. Now I'll have to get up every time I\nwant to take sights on stars!\"\n\n\"Don't you ever get tired of complaining?\" asked Astro.\n\n\"Ah--rocket off,\" snarled Roger.\n\n\"Hey, you guys,\" yelled Tom from below, \"better get down here! Captain\nStrong's coming aboard.\"\n\nClimbing back down the ladder to the control deck, Astro leaned over his\nshoulder and asked Roger, \"Do you really think he'll let us take this\nbaby up for a hop, Manning?\"\n\n\"Get your head out of that cloud, Astro. You'll pull about three weeks\nof dry runs before this baby gets five inches off the ground.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't be too sure of that, Manning!\" Strong's voice boomed out as\nhe climbed up through the control-deck hatch. The three boys immediately\nsnapped to attention.\n\nStrong walked around the control deck, fingering the controls lightly.\n\n\"This is a fine ship,\" he mused aloud. \"One of the finest that\nscientific brains can build. She's yours. The day you graduate from the\nAcademy, _IF_ you graduate, and I can think of about a thousand reasons\nwhy you won't, you'll command an armed rocket cruiser similar to this.\nAs a matter of fact, the only difference between this ship and those\nthat patrol the space lanes now is in the armament.\"\n\n\"Don't we have any arms aboard at all, sir?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"Small arms, like paralo-ray pistols and paralo-ray rifles. Plus four\natomic war heads for emergency use,\" replied Strong.\n\nSeeing a puzzled expression cross Astro's face, the Solar Guard officer\ncontinued, \"You haven't studied armament yet, Astro, but paralo rays are\nthe only weapons used by law-enforcement agencies in the Solar Alliance.\nThey work on a principle of controlled energy, sending out a ray with an\neffective range of fifty yards that can paralyze the nervous system of\nany beast or human.\"\n\n\"And it doesn't kill, sir?\" inquired Astro.\n\n\"No, Astro,\" replied Strong. \"Paralyzing a man is just as effective as\nkilling him. The Solar Alliance doesn't believe you have to kill anyone,\nnot even the most vicious criminal. Freeze him and capture him, and you\nstill have the opportunity of making him a useful citizen.\"\n\n\"But if you can't?\" inquired Roger dryly.\n\n\"Then he's kept on the prison asteroid where he can't harm anyone.\"\nStrong turned away abruptly. \"But this isn't the time for a general\ndiscussion. We've got work to do!\"\n\nHe walked over to the master control panel and switched the teleceiver\nscreen. There was a slight buzz, and a view of the spaceport outside the\nship suddenly came into focus, filling the screen. Strong flipped a\nswitch and a view aft on the _Polaris_ filled the glowing square. The\naluminum scaffolding was being hauled away by a jet truck. Again the\nview changed as Strong twisted the dials in front of him.\n\n\"Just scanning the outside, boys,\" he commented. \"Have to make sure\nthere isn't anyone near the ship when we blast off. The rocket exhaust\nis powerful enough to blow a man two hundred feet, to say nothing of\nburning him to death.\"\n\n\"You mean, sir--\" began Tom, not daring to hope.\n\n\"Of course, Corbett,\" smiled Strong. \"Take your stations for blast-off.\nWe raise ship as soon as we get orbital clearance from spaceport\ncontrol!\"\n\nWithout waiting for further orders, the three boys scurried to their\nstations.\n\nSoon the muffled whine of the energizing pumps on the power deck began\nto ring through the ship, along with the steady beep of the radar\nscanner on the radar bridge. Tom checked the maze of gauges and dials on\nthe control board. Air locks, hatches, oxygen supply, circulating\nsystem, circuits, and feeds. In five minutes the two-hundred-foot\nshining steel hull was a living thing as her rocket motors purred,\nwarming up for the initial thrust.\n\nTom made a last sweeping check of the complicated board and turned to\nCaptain Strong who stood to one side watching.\n\n\"Ship ready to blast off, sir,\" he announced. \"Shall I check stations\nand proceed to raise ship?\"\n\n\"Carry on, Cadet Corbett,\" Strong replied. \"Log yourself in as skipper\nwith me along as supercargo. I'll ride in the second pilot's chair.\"\n\nTom snapped a sharp salute and added vocally, \"Aye, aye, sir!\"\n\nHe turned back to the control board, strapped himself into the command\npilot's seat and opened the circuit to the spaceport control tower.\n\n\"Rocket cruiser _Polaris_ to spaceport control,\" he droned into the\nmicrophone. \"Check in!\"\n\n\"Spaceport control to _Polaris_,\" the voice of the tower operator\nreplied. \"You are cleared for blast-off in two minutes. Take out--orbit\n75 ... repeat ... 75....\"\n\n\"_Polaris_ to spaceport control. Orders received and understood. End\ntransmission!\"\n\nTom then turned his attention to the station check.\n\n\"Control deck to radar deck. Check in.\"\n\n\"Radar deck, aye! Ready to raise ship.\" Roger's voice was relaxed, easy.\n\nTom turned to the board to adjust the teleceiver screen for a clear\npicture of the stern of the ship. Gradually it came up in as sharp\ndetail as if he had been standing on the ground.\n\nHe checked the electric timing device in front of him that ticked off\nthe seconds, as a red hand crawled around to _zero_, and when it swept\ndown to the thirty-second mark, Tom pulled the microphone to his lips\nagain. \"Control deck to power deck. Check in!\"\n\n\"Power deck, aye?\"\n\n\"Energize the cooling pumps!\"\n\n\"Cooling pumps, aye!\" repeated Astro.\n\n\"Feed reactant!\"\n\n\"Reactant at D-9 rate.\"\n\nFrom seventy feet below them, Strong and Tom heard the hiss of the\nreactant mass feeding into the rocket motors, and the screeching whine\nof the mighty pumps that kept the mass from building too rapidly and\nexploding.\n\nThe second hand swept up to the twenty-second mark.\n\n\"Control deck to radar deck,\" called Tom. \"Do we have a clear trajectory\nforward?\"\n\n\"All clear forward and overhead,\" replied Roger.\n\nTom placed his hand on the master switch that would throw the combined\ncircuits, instruments and gauges into the single act of blasting the\nmighty ship into space. His eyes glued to the sweeping hand, he counted\npast the twelve-second mark--eleven--ten--nine--\n\n\"Stand by to raise ship,\" he bawled into the microphone.\n\"Minus--five--four--three--two--one--_zero_!\"\n\nTom threw the master switch.\n\nThere was a split-second pause and then the great ship roared into life.\nSlowly at first, she lifted her tail full of roaring jets free of the\nground. Ten feet--twenty--fifty--a hundred--five hundred--a\nthousand--picking up speed at an incredible rate.\n\nTom felt himself being pushed deeper and deeper into the softness of the\nacceleration cushions. He had been worried about not being able to keep\nhis eyes open to see the dwindling Earth in the teleceiver over his\nhead, but the tremendous force of the rockets pushing him against\ngravity to tear the two hundred tons of steel away from the Earth's grip\nheld his eyelids open for him. As the powerful rockets tore deeper into\nthe gap that separated the ship from Earth, he saw the spaceport\ngradually grow smaller. The rolling hills around the Academy closed in,\nand then the Academy itself, with the Tower of Galileo shrinking to a\nwhite stick, was lost in the brown and green that was Earth. The rockets\npushed harder and harder and he saw the needle of the acceleration gauge\ncreep slowly up. Four--five--six--seven--eight--nine--ten miles a\nsecond!\n\nWhen the awful crushing weight on his body seemed unbearable, when he\nfelt as though he would never be able to draw another breath, suddenly\nthe pressure lifted and Tom felt amazingly and wonderfully buoyant. He\nseemed to be floating in mid-air, his body rising against the webbed\nstraps of his chair! With a start and a momentary wave of panic, he\nrealized that he _was_ floating! Only the straps kept him from rising to\nthe ceiling of the control room!\n\nRecovering quickly, he realized that he was in free fall. The ship had\ncleared the pull of earth's gravity and was out in space where\neverything was weightless. Reaching toward the control panel, he flipped\nthe switch for the synthetic-gravity generator and, seconds later, felt\nthe familiar and reassuring sensation of the chair under him as the\ngenerator supplied an artificial-gravity field to the ship.\n\nAs he loosened the straps in his chair, he noticed Captain Strong rising\nfrom his position beside him and he grinned sheepishly in answer to the\ntwinkle in Strong's eye.\n\n\"It's all right, Tom,\" reassured Strong. \"Happens to everyone the first\ntime. Carry on.\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" replied Tom and he turned to the microphone. \"Control\ndeck to all stations! We are in space! Observe standard cruise\nprocedure!\"\n\n\"Power deck, aye!\" was Astro's blasting answer over the loud-speaker.\n\"Yeeeoooww! Out where we belong at last.\"\n\n\"Radar bridge here,\" Roger's voice chimed in softly on the speaker.\n\"Everything under control. And, Astro, you belong in a zoo if you're\ngoing to bellow like that!\"\n\n\"Ahhh--rocket off, bubblehead!\" The big Venusian's reply was\ngood-natured. He was too happy to let Roger get under his skin.\n\n\"All right, you two,\" interrupted Tom. \"Knock it off. We're on a ship\nnow. Let's cut the kindergarten stuff!\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, skipper!\" Astro was irrepressible.\n\n\"Yes, _sir_!\" Roger's voice was soft but Tom recognized the biting edge\nto the last word.\n\nTurning away from the controls, he faced Captain Strong who had been\nwatching quietly.\n\n\"_Polaris_ space-borne at nine hundred thirty-three hours, Captain\nStrong. All stations operating efficiently.\"\n\n\"Very competent job, Corbett,\" nodded Strong in approval. \"You handled\nthe ship as if you'd been doing it for years.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir.\"\n\n\"We'll just cruise for a while on this orbit so you boys can get the\nfeel of the ship and of space.\" The Solar Guard officer took Tom's place\nin the command pilot's chair. \"You knock off for a while. Go up to the\nradar bridge and have a look around. I'll take over here.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" Tom turned and had to restrain himself from racing up the\nladder to the radar bridge. When he climbed through the hatch to Roger's\nstation, he found his unit-mate tilted back in his chair, staring\nthrough the crystal blister over his head.\n\n\"Hiya, spaceboy,\" smiled Roger. He indicated the blister. \"Take a look\nat the wide, deep and high.\"\n\nTom looked up and saw the deep blackness that was space.\n\n\"It's like looking into a mirror, Roger,\" he breathed in awe. \"Only\nthere isn't any other side--no reflection. It just doesn't stop, does\nit?\"\n\n\"Nope,\" commented Roger, \"it just goes on and on and on. And no one\nknows where it stops. And no one can even guess.\"\n\n\"Ah--you've got a touch of space fever,\" laughed Astro. \"You'd better\ntake it easy, pal.\"\n\nTom suppressed a smile. Now, for the first time, he felt that there was\na chance to achieve unity among them. Kill him with kindness, he\nthought, that's the way to do it.\n\n\"All right, boys!\" Captain Strong's voice crackled over the speaker.\n\"Time to pull in your eyeballs and get to work again. We're heading back\nto the spaceport! Take your stations for landing!\"\n\nTom and Astro immediately jumped toward the open hatch and started\nscrambling down the ladder toward their respective stations while Roger\nstrapped himself into his chair in front of the astrogation panel.\n\nWithin sixty seconds the ship was ready for landing procedure and at a\nnod from Captain Strong, who again strapped himself into the second\npilot's chair, Tom began the delicate operation.\n\nEntering Earth's atmosphere, Tom gave a series of rapid orders for\ncourse changes and power adjustments, and then, depressing the master\nturn control, spun the ship around so that she would settle stern first\ntoward her ramp at the Academy spaceport.\n\n\"Radar deck to control deck,\" called Roger over the intercom. \"One\nthousand feet to touchdown!\"\n\n\"Control deck, aye,\" answered Tom. \"Control deck to power deck. Check\nin.\"\n\n\"Power deck, aye,\" replied Astro.\n\n\"Stand by to adjust thrust to maximum drive at my command,\" ordered Tom.\n\n\"Power deck, aye.\"\n\nThe great ship, balanced perfectly on the hot exhaust, slowly slipped\ntoward the ground.\n\n\"Five hundred feet to touchdown,\" warned Roger.\n\n\"Main rockets full blast,\" ordered Tom.\n\nThe sudden blast of the powerful jets slowed the descent of the ship,\nand finally, fifty feet above the ground, Tom snapped out another order.\n\n\"Cut main rockets! Hold auxiliary!\"\n\nA moment later there was a gentle bump and the _Polaris_ rested on the\nramp, her nose pointed to the heavens.\n\n\"_Touchdown!_\" yelled Tom. \"Cut everything, fellas, and come up and sign\nthe log. We made it--our first hop into space! We're spacemen!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 10\n\n\n\"The next event will be,\" Warrant Officer McKenny's voice boomed over\nthe loud-speaker and echoed over the Academy stadium, \"the last\nsemifinal round of mercuryball. _Polaris_ unit versus _Arcturus_ unit.\"\n\nAs two thousand space cadets, crowded in the grandstands watching the\nannual academy tournament, rose to their feet and cheered lustily, Tom\nCorbett turned to his unit-mates Astro and Roger and called\nenthusiastically, \"O.K., fellas. Let's go out there and show them how to\nplay this game!\"\n\nDuring the two days of the tournament, Tom, Roger and Astro, competing\nas a unit against all the other academy units, had piled up a tremendous\namount of points in all the events. But so had Unit 77-K, now known as\nthe _Capella_ unit. Now with the _Capella_ unit already in the finals,\nthe _Polaris_ crew had to win their semifinal round against the\n_Arcturus_, in order to meet the _Capella_ in the final round for\nAcademy honors.\n\n\"This is going to be a cinch,\" boasted Astro. \"I'm going to burn 'em\nup!\"\n\n\"Save it for the field,\" said Tom with a smile.\n\n\"Yeah, you big Venusian ape,\" added Roger. \"Make points instead of space\ngas.\"\n\nStripped to the waist, wearing shorts and soft, three-quarter-length\nspace boots, the three boys walked onto the sun-baked field amid the\nrousing cheers from the stands. Across the field, the cadets of the\n_Arcturus_ unit walked out to meet them, stopping beside McKenny at the\nmid-field line. Mike waited for the six boys to form a circle around\nhim, while he held the mercuryball, a twelve-inch plastic sphere, filled\nwith air and the tricky tube of mercury.\n\n\"You all know the rules,\" announced McKenny abruptly. \"Head, shoulders,\nfeet, knees, or any part of your body except your hands, can touch the\nball. _Polaris_ unit will defend the north goal,\" he said, pointing to a\nwhite chalk line fifty yards away, \"_Arcturus_ the south,\" and he\npointed to a line equally distant in the opposite direction.\n\"Five-minute periods, with one-minute rest between. All clear?\"\n\nAs captain of the _Polaris_ unit, Tom nodded, while smiling at the\ncaptain of the _Arcturus_ team, a tow-headed boy with short chunky legs\nnamed Schohari.\n\n\"All clear, Mike,\" said Tom.\n\n\"All clear here, Mike,\" responded Schohari.\n\n\"All right, shake hands and take your places.\"\n\nThe six boys shook hands and jogged toward respective opposite lines.\nMike waited for them to reach their goal lines, and then placed the ball\nin the middle of a chalk-drawn circle.\n\nToeing the line, Tom, Roger and Astro eyed the _Arcturus_ crew and\nprepared for the dash to the ball.\n\n\"All right, fellas,\" urged Tom, \"let's show them something!\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" breathed Astro, \"just let me get my size thirteens on that\npumpkin before it starts twisting around!\"\n\nAstro wanted the advantage of the first kick at the ball while the\nmercury tube inside was still quiet. Once the mercury was agitated, the\nball would be as easy to kick as a well-greased eel.\n\n\"We'll block for you, Astro,\" said Tom, \"and you put every ounce of\nbeef you've got into that first kick. If we're lucky, we might be able\nto get the jump on them!\"\n\n\"Cut the chatter,\" snapped Roger nervously. \"Baldy's ready to give us\nthe go ahead!\"\n\nStanding on the side lines, Warrant Officer McKenny slowly raised his\nhand, and the crowd in the grandstand hushed in eager anticipation. A\nsecond passed and then there was a tremendous roar as he brought his\nhand down and blew heavily on the whistle.\n\nRunning as if their lives depended on it, the six cadets of the two\nunits raced headlong toward the ball. Tom, just a little faster than\nRoger or Astro, flashed down the field and veered off to block the\nadvancing Schohari. Roger, following him, charged into Swift, the second\nmember of the _Arcturus_ crew. Astro, a few feet in back of them,\nrunning with surprising speed for his size, saw that it was going to be\na close race between himself and Allen, the third member of the\n_Arcturus_ unit. He bowed his head and drove himself harder, the roar of\nthe crowd filling his ears.\n\n\" ... Go Astro!... Go Astro!...\"\n\nPounding down for the kick, Astro gauged his stride perfectly and with\none last, mighty leap swung his right foot at the ball.\n\nThere was a loud thud drowned by a roar from the crowd as the ball\nsailed off the ground with terrific force. And then almost immediately\nthere was another thud as Allen rose in a desperate leap to block the\nball with his shoulder. It caromed off at a crazy angle, wobbling in its\nflight as the mercury within rolled from side to side. Swift, of the\n_Arcturus_ crew, reached the ball first and sent it sailing at an angle\nover Tom's head to bounce thirty feet away. Seeing Astro charge the\nball, Tom threw a block on Allen to knock him out of the play. The big\nVenusian, judging his stride to be a little off, shortened his steps to\nmove in for the kick. But just as he brought his foot forward to make\ncontact, the ball spun away to the left. Astro's foot continued in a\nperfect arc over his head, throwing him in a heap on the ground.\n\nTwo thousand voices from the stands roared in one peal of laughter.\n\nWhile Astro lay on the ground with the wind knocked out of him, Schohari\nand Swift converged on the ball. With Astro down and Tom out of\nposition, the _Arcturus_ unit seemed certain of scoring. But again the\nball rolled crazily, this time straight to Roger, the last defender. He\nnudged it between his opponents toward Tom, who, in turn, kicked it\nobliquely past Allen back to Roger again. Running with the grace and\nspeed of an antelope, the blond cadet met the ball in mid-field, and\nwhen it dropped to the ground in front of him, sent it soaring across\nthe goal with one powerful kick!\n\nAs the cadets in the stands sent up a tumultuous cheer for the perfectly\nexecuted play, the whistle blew, ending the period and the _Polaris_\nunit led, one to nothing.\n\nBreathing deeply, Astro and Roger flopped down near Tom and stretched\nfull length on the grass.\n\n\"That was a beautiful shot, Roger,\" said Tom. \"Perfectly timed!\"\n\n\"Yeah, hot-shot,\" agreed Astro, \"I'm glad to see that big head of yours\nis good for something!\"\n\n\"Listen, fellas,\" said Roger eagerly, ignoring Astro, \"to go into the\nfinals against Richards and the _Capella_ unit, we've got to beat the\n_Arcturus_ crew, right?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" agreed Tom, \"and it won't be easy. We just happened to get the\nbreaks.\"\n\n\"Then why don't we put the game on ice?\" said Roger. \"Freeze the ball!\nWe got 'em one to nothing, that's enough to beat them. When the whistle\nblows and it's over, we win!\"\n\nAstro looked at Tom, who frowned and replied, \"But we've still got three\nperiods left, Roger. It isn't fair to freeze this early in the game. If\nit was the last minute or so, sure. But not so early. It just isn't\nfair.\"\n\n\"What do you want to do?\" snarled Roger. \"Win, or play fair?\"\n\n\"Win, of course, but I want to win the right way,\" said Tom.\n\n\"How about you, Astro?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"I feel the same way that Tom does,\" said the big cadet. \"We can beat\nthese guys easily--and on the square.\"\n\n\"You guys make it sound like I was cheating,\" snapped Roger.\n\n\"Well,\" said Tom, \"it sure isn't giving the _Arcturus_ guys a break.\"\n\nThe whistle blew for them to return to the goal line.\n\n\"Well,\" asked Roger, \"do we freeze or don't we?\"\n\n\"I don't want to. But majority always rules in this unit, Roger.\" Tom\nglanced at Astro. \"How about it, Astro?\"\n\n\"We can beat 'em fair and square. We play all out!\" answered Astro.\n\nRoger didn't say anything. He moved to one side and took his position\nfor the dash down field.\n\nThe whistle blew again and the crowd roared as the two teams charged\ntoward the ball. The cadets were eager to see if the _Arcturus_ crew\ncould tie the score or if the crew of the _Polaris_ would increase its\nlead. But after a few moments of play, their cries of encouragement\nsubsided into rumbles of discontent. In its eagerness to score, the\n_Arcturus_ unit kept making errors and lost the ball constantly but the\ncrew of the _Polaris_ failed to capitalize. The second period ended with\nthe score unchanged.\n\nAs he slumped to the ground for the rest period, Astro turned on Roger\nbitterly. \"What's the idea, Manning? You're dogging it!\"\n\n\"You play your game, Astro,\" replied Roger calmly, \"I'll play mine.\"\n\n\"We're playing this game as a team, Roger,\" chimed in Tom heatedly.\n\"You're kicking the ball all over the lot!\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" added Astro. \"In every direction except the goal!\"\n\n\"I was never clear,\" defended Roger. \"I didn't want to lose possession\nof the ball!\"\n\n\"You sure didn't,\" said Tom. \"You acted as if it was your best friend\nand you never wanted to be separated from it!\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"We said we didn't want to freeze this game, Roger, and we meant it!\"\nAstro glowered at his unit-mate. \"Next period you show us some action!\nIf you don't want to score, feed it to us and we'll save you the\ntrouble!\"\n\nBut the third period was the same. While Tom and Astro dashed up and\ndown the field, blocking out the members of the _Arcturus_ crew to give\nRoger a clear shot, he simply nudged the ball back and forth between the\nside lines, ignoring his teammates' pleas to drive forward. As the\nwhistle sounded for the end of the period, boos and catcalls from the\ngrandstand filled the air.\n\nTom's face was an angry red as he faced Roger again on the side lines\nduring the rest period.\n\n\"You hear that, Roger?\" he growled, nodding his head toward the stands.\n\"That's what they think of your smart playing!\"\n\n\"What do I care?\" replied the blond cadet arrogantly. \"They're not\nplaying this game! I am!\"\n\n\"And we are too!\" Astro's voice was a low rumble as he came up behind\nManning. \"If you don't give us a chance, so help me, I'll use your head\nfor a ball!\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\"If you're so interested in scoring, why don't you go after the ball\nyourselves then?\" said Roger.\n\n\"Because we're too busy trying to be a team!\" snapped Tom. \"We're trying\nto clear shots for you!\"\n\n\"Don't be so generous,\" sneered Roger.\n\n\"I'm warning you, Roger\"--Astro glared at the arrogant cadet--\"if you\ndon't straighten out and fly right--\"\n\nMcKenny's whistle from the far side lines suddenly sounded, interrupting\nthe big cadet, and the three boys trooped back out on the field again.\nAgain the air was filled with boos and shouts of derision and Tom's face\nflushed with shame.\n\nThis time, when McKenny's hand flashed downward, Tom streaked for the\nball, instead of Schohari, his usual opponent. He measured his stride\ncarefully and reached the ball in perfect kicking position.\n\nHe felt the satisfying thud against his foot, and saw the ball shoot out\nhigh in front of him and head for the goal line. It was a beautiful\nkick. But then, the ball suddenly sank, its flight altered by the action\nof the mercury. Running down field, Tom saw Swift and Allen meet the\nball together. Allen blocked it with his chest and caromed it over to\nSwift. Swift let the ball drop to the ground, drawing his foot back to\nkick. But again, the mercury changed the ball's action, twisting it to\none side and Swift's kick caught it on the side. Instead of the ball\ngoing down field, it veered to the left, in the path of Astro. Quickly\ngetting his head under it, he shifted it to Roger, who streaked in and\nstopped it with his hip. But then, instead of passing ahead to Tom, who\nby now was down field and in the open, Roger prepared to kick for the\ngoal himself.\n\nTom shouted a warning but it was too late. Schohari came rushing in\nbehind him, and at running stride, met the ball squarely with his right\nfoot. It sailed high in the air and over the _Polaris_ goal line just\nas the whistle blew. The game was tied.\n\n\"That was some play, Manning,\" said Astro, when they were lined up\nwaiting for the next period to begin.\n\n\"You asked for it,\" snapped Roger, \"you were yapping at me to play, and\nnow look what's happened!\"\n\n\"Listen, you loudmouthed punk!\" said Astro, advancing toward the smaller\ncadet, but just then the whistle blew and the three boys ran out onto\nthe field.\n\nThe _Arcturus_ crew swept down the field quickly, heading for the ball\nand seemingly ignoring the _Polaris_ unit. But Schohari slipped and fell\non the grass which gave Tom a clear shot at the ball. He caught it with\nthe side of his boot and passed it toward Roger. But Allen, at full\nspeed, came in and intercepted, sending the ball in a crazy succession\nof twists, turns and bounces. The crowd came to its feet as all six\ncadets made desperate attempts to clear the skittering ball with none of\nthem so much as touching it. This was the part of mercuryball that\npleased the spectator. Finally, Schohari managed to get a toe on it and\nhe sent it down field, but Astro had moved out to play defense. He\nstopped the ball on his shoulder and dropped it to the ground. Steadying\nit there, he waited until Tom was in the clear and kicked it forty yards\nto the mid-field stripe.\n\nThe crowd came to its feet, sensing this final drive might mean victory\nfor the _Polaris_ crew. The boys of the _Arcturus_ swarmed in--trying to\nkeep Tom from scoring. With a tremendous burst of speed, Tom reached the\nball ahead of Schohari, and with the strength of desperation, he slammed\nhis foot against it. The whistle blew ending the game as the ball rose\nin an arc down the field and fell short of the goal by ten feet. There\nwas a groan from the crowd.\n\nBut suddenly the ball, still reacting to the mercury inside, spun like\na top, rolled sideways, and as if it were being blown by a breeze,\nrolled toward the goal line and stopped six inches inside the white\nchalk line.\n\nThere was a moment's pause as the crowd and the players, stunned by the\nplay, grasped what had happened. Then swelling into a roar, there was\none word chanted over and over--\"_Polaris--Polaris--Polaris_....\"\n\nThe _Polaris_ unit had reached the finals of the Academy tournament.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDuring the intermission Charlie Wolcheck, unit commander of the\n_Capella_ crew, walked over to the refreshment unit behind the\ngrandstand where Steve Strong, Dr. Dale and Commander Walters were\ndrinking Martian water and eating spaceburgers.\n\n\"Afternoon, Commander,\" saluted Wolcheck. \"Hello, Joan, Steve. Looks as\nthough your boys on the _Polaris_ are going to meet their match this\nafternoon. I've got to admit they're good, but with Tony Richards\nfeeding passes to Al Davison and with the blocking of Scott McAvoy--\"\nThe young officer broke off with a grin.\n\n\"I don't know, Charlie,\" Commander Walters said with a wink to Dr. Dale.\n\"From the looks of Cadet Astro, if he ever gets his foot on the ball,\nyour _Capella_ unit will have to go after it with a jet boat.\"\n\n\"Why, Commander,\" replied Wolcheck, laughing good-naturedly, \"Tony\nRichards is one of the finest booters I've ever seen. Saw him make a\ngoal from the sixty-yard line from a standstill.\"\n\nSteve Strong waved a Martian water pop bottle at young Wolcheck in a\ngesture of friendly derision.\n\n\"Did you happen to see the play in the first period?\" he boasted.\n\"Manning took a perfect pass from Astro and scored. You're finished,\nWolcheck, you and your _Capella_ unit won't even come close.\"\n\n\"From what I hear and see, Manning seems to be a little sore that he\ncan't make all the scores himself,\" grinned Wolcheck slyly. \"He wants to\nbe the whole show!\"\n\nStrong reddened and turned to put the empty bottle on the counter, using\nit as an excuse to hide his feelings from the commander and Joan. So\nWolcheck had observed Manning's attitude and play on the field too.\n\nBefore Strong could reply, a bugle sounded from the field and the group\nof Solar Guard officers returned to their seats for the final game of\nthe tournament between the _Capella_ and the _Polaris_ units.\n\nOut on the field Mike made his usual speech about playing fair and gave\nthe cadets the routine instructions of the game, reminding them that\nthey were spacemen first, unit-members second, and individuals third and\nlast. The six boys shook hands and jogged down the field to take up\ntheir positions.\n\n\"How about concentrating on the passes Richards is going to feed to\nDavison,\" Tom asked his unit-mates. \"Never mind blocking out Richards\nand McAvoy.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" agreed Astro, \"play for the ball. Sounds good to me.\"\n\n\"How about it, Roger?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"Just play the game,\" said Roger. And then added sarcastically, \"And\ndon't forget to give them every chance to score. Let's play fair and\nsquare, the way we did with the _Arcturus_ unit.\"\n\n\"If you feel that way, Manning,\" answered Astro coldly, \"you can quit\nright now! We'll handle the _Capella_ guys ourselves!\"\n\nBefore Roger could answer, McKenny blew the ready whistle and the three\nboys lined up along the white chalk line preparing for the dash to the\nwaiting ball.\n\nThe cadets in the stands were hushed. McKenny's hand swept up and then\nquickly down as he blew the whistle. The crowd came to its feet,\nroaring, as Tom, five steps from his own goal line, tripped and fell\nheadlong to the grass, putting him out of the first play. Astro and\nRoger charged down the field, with Astro reaching the ball first. He\nmanaged a good kick, but Richards, three feet away, took the ball\nsquarely on his chest. The mercuryball fell to the ground, spun in a\ndizzy circle and with a gentle tap by Richards, rolled to Davison, who\ntook it in stride and sent it soaring for a forty-five-yard goal.\n\nThe _Capella_ unit had drawn first blood.\n\n\"Well, hot-shot,\" snarled Roger back on the starting line, \"what\nhappened to the big pass-stealing idea?\"\n\n\"I tripped, Manning,\" said Tom through clenched teeth.\n\n\"Yeah! Tripped!\" sneered Roger.\n\nThe whistle blew for the next goal.\n\nTom, with an amazing burst of speed, swept down the field, broke stride\nto bring him in perfect line with the ball and with a kick that seemed\nalmost lazy, sent the ball from a dead standstill, fifty yards over the\n_Capella_ goal before any of the remaining players were within five feet\nof it, and the score was tied.\n\nThe crowd sprang to its feet again and roared his name.\n\n\"That was terrific!\" said Astro, slapping Tom on the back as they lined\nup again. \"It looked as though you hardly kicked that ball at all.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" muttered Roger, \"you really made yourself the grandstand's\ndelight!\"\n\n\"What's that supposed to mean, Manning?\" asked Astro.\n\n\"Superman Corbett probably burned himself out! Let's see him keep up\nthat speed for the next ten minutes!\"\n\nThe whistle blew for the next goal, and again the three boys moved\nforward to meet the onrushing _Capella_ unit.\n\nRichards blocked Astro with a twist of his body, and without stopping\nhis forward motion, kicked the ball squarely toward the goal. It stopped\nten feet short, took a dizzying spin and rolled away from the goal line.\nIn a flash, the six boys were around the ball, blocking, shoving, and\nyelling instructions to each other while at the same time kicking at the\nunsteady ball. With each grazing kick, the ball went into even more\nmaddening spins and gyrations.\n\nAt last Richards caught it with the side of his foot, flipped it to\nMcAvoy who dropped back, and with twenty feet between him and the\nnearest _Polaris_ member, calmly booted it over the goal. The whistle\nblew ending the first period, and the _Capella_ unit led two to one.\n\nDuring the next three periods, the _Capella_ unit worked like a\nwell-oiled machine. Richards passed to Davison or McAvoy, and when they\nwere too well guarded, played brilliantly alone. The _Polaris_ unit, on\nthe other hand, appeared to be hopelessly outclassed. Tom and Astro\nfought like demons but Roger's lack of interest gave the _Capella_ unit\nthe edge in play. At the end of the fourth period, the _Capella_ team\nled by three points, seven to four.\n\nWhile the boys rested before the fifth and final period, Captain Strong,\nhaving watched the play with keen interest, realized that Roger was not\nplaying up to his fullest capabilities. Suddenly he summoned a near-by\nEarthworm cadet, scribbled a message on a slip of paper and instructed\nthe cadet to take it directly to Roger.\n\n\"Orders from the coach on the side lines?\" asked Wolcheck as he noticed\nStrong's action.\n\n\"You might call it that, Charlie,\" answered Steve blandly.\n\nOn the field, the cadet messenger handed Roger the slip of paper, not\nmentioning that it was from Strong, and hurried back to the stands.\n\n\"Getting fan mail already?\" asked Astro.\n\nRoger ignored the comment and opened the slip of paper to read:\n\n\" ... It might interest you to know that the winning team of the\nmercuryball finals is to be awarded a first prize of three days' liberty\nin Atom City....\" There was no signature.\n\nRoger stared up into the stands and searched vainly for some indication\nof the person who might have sent him the note. The crowd hushed as\nMcKenny stepped forward for the starting of the last period.\n\n\"What was in the note, Roger?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"The winning combination,\" smiled Roger lazily. \"Get set for the fastest\ngame of mercuryball you've ever played, Corbett! We've got to pull this\nmess out of the fire!\"\n\nBewildered, Tom looked at Astro who merely shrugged his shoulders and\ntook his place ready for the whistle. Roger tucked the note into his\nshorts and stepped up to the line.\n\n\"Listen, Corbett,\" said Roger, \"every time Richards gets the ball, he\nkicks it to his left, and then McAvoy feints as if to get it, leaving\nDavison in the open. When you go to block Davison, you leave Richards in\nthe clear. He just keeps the ball. He's scored three times that way!\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Tom, \"I noticed that, but there was nothing I could do\nabout it, the way you've been playing.\"\n\n\"Kinda late in the game for any new ideas, Manning,\" growled Astro.\n\"Just get the ball and pass it to me.\"\n\n\"That's my whole idea! Play back, Astro. Move like you're very tired,\nsee? Then they'll forget about you and play three on two. You just be\nready to kick and kick hard!\"\n\n\"What's happened to you, Roger?\" asked Tom. \"What was in that note?\"\n\nBefore Roger could answer, the whistle and the roar from the crowd\nsignaled the beginning of the last period. The cadets raced down the\nfield, Roger swerving to the left and making a feint at blocking\nRichards. He missed intentionally and allowed Richards to get the ball,\nwho immediately passed to the left. McAvoy raced in on the ball, Tom\nmade a move as if to block him, reversed, and startled the onrushing\nRichards with a perfect block. The ball was in the clear. Roger gave it\na half kick and the ball landed two feet in front of Astro. The big\ncadet caught it perfectly on the first bounce and kicked it on a line\nacross the goal, seventy yards away.\n\nUp in the stands, Steve Strong smiled as he watched the score change on\nthe board: \"_Capella_ seven--_Polaris_ five!\"\n\nIn rapid succession, the _Polaris_ unit succeeded in intercepting the\nplay of the _Capella_ unit and rolling up two goals to an even score.\nNow, there were only fifty-five seconds left to play.\n\nThe cadets in the stands roared their approval of the gallant effort\nmade by the three members of the _Polaris_ crew. It had been a long time\nsince mercuryball had been played with such deadly accuracy at Space\nAcademy and everyone who attended the game was to remember for years to\ncome the last play of the game.\n\nMcKenny blew the whistle again and the boys charged forward, but by\nnow, aware of the sudden flash of unity on the part of the opposing\nteam, the _Capella_ unit fought desperately to salvage at least a tie.\n\nTom managed to block a kick by Richards, and the ball took a dizzy hop\nto the left, landing in front of Astro. He was in the clear. The stands\nwere in an uproar as the cadets saw that the game was nearly over. Astro\npaused a split second, judged the ball and stepped forward to kick. But\nthe ball spun away, just as Astro swung his leg. And at that instant,\nMcAvoy came charging in from the left, only to be blocked by Roger. But\nthe force of McAvoy's charge knocked Roger back into Astro. Instead of\nkicking the ball, Astro caught Roger on the side of the head. Roger fell\nto the ground and lay still. He was knocked cold. Astro lost his\nbalance, twisted on one leg unsteadily, and then fell to the ground.\nWhen he tried to get up, he couldn't walk. He had twisted his ankle.\n\nThe _Capella_ unit members stood still, confused and momentarily unable\nto take advantage of their opportunity. Without a moment's hesitation,\nTom swept in and kicked the ball before his opponents realized what had\nhappened. The ball drifted up in a high arc and landed with several\nbounces, stopping five feet from the goal.\n\nSuddenly Richards, McAvoy and Davison came alive and charged after Tom,\nwho was running for the ball as fast as his weary legs would carry him.\nHe saw Richards pull up alongside of him, then pass him. Then Davison\nand McAvoy closed in on either side to block and give Richards a clear\nshot back down the field and a certain score.\n\nRichards reached the ball, stopped and carefully lined up his kick,\ncertain that his teammates could block out Tom. But the young cadet, in\na last desperate spurt, outraced both McAvoy and Davison. Then, as\nRichards cocked his foot to kick, Tom jumped. With a mighty leaping\ndive, he sent his body hurtling headlong toward Richards just as he\nkicked. Tom's body crashed into the ball and Richards. The two boys went\ndown in a heap but the ball caromed off his chest and rolled over the\ngoal line.\n\nThe whistle blew ending the game.\n\nIn an instant, two thousand officers, cadets and enlisted men went wild\nas the ball rolled across the goal line.\n\nThe _Polaris_ crew had won eight goals to seven!\n\nFrom every corner of the field, the crowd cheered the cadets who had\nfinished the game, had won it in the final seconds with two of them\nsprawled on the field unconscious and a third unable to stand on his\nfeet.\n\nUp in the stands, Captain Strong turned to Commander Walters. He found\nit hard to keep his eyes from filling up as he saluted briskly.\n\n\"Captain Strong reporting, sir, on the success of the _Polaris_ unit to\novercome their differences and become a fighting unit! And I mean\n_fight_!\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 11\n\n\n\"Atom City Express now arriving on track two!\" The voice boomed over the\nloud-speaker system; and as the long, gleaming line of monorail cars\neased to a stop with a soft hissing of brakes, the three cadets of the\n_Polaris_ unit moved eagerly in that direction.\n\n\"Atom City, here we come,\" cried Astro.\n\n\"We and a lot of others with the same idea,\" said Tom. And, in fact,\nthere were only a few civilians in the crowd pressing toward the car\ndoors. Uniforms predominated--the blue of the cadets, enlisted men in\nscarlet, even a few in the black and gold uniforms which identified the\nofficers of the Solar Guard.\n\n\"Personally,\" whispered Tom to his friends, \"the first thing I want to\ndo at Atom City is take a long walk--somewhere where I won't see a\nsingle uniform.\"\n\n\"As for me,\" drawled Roger, \"I'm going to find a stereo studio where\nthey're showing a Liddy Tamal feature. I'll sit down in a front-row seat\nand just watch that girl act for about six hours.\"\n\nHe turned to Astro. \"And how about you?\"\n\n\"Why ... why ... I'll string along with you, Roger,\" said the cadet from\nVenus. \"It's been a long time since I've seen a--a--\"\n\nTom and Roger laughed.\n\n\"A what?\" teased Tom.\n\n\"A--a--girl,\" sputtered Astro, blushing.\n\n\"I don't believe it,\" said Roger in mock surprise. \"I never--\"\n\n\"Come on,\" interrupted Tom. \"Time to get aboard.\"\n\nThey hurried across the platform and entered the sleek car. Inside they\nfound seats together and sank into the luxurious chairs.\n\nAstro sighed gently, stretched out his long legs and closed his eyes\nblissfully for a few moments.\n\n\"Don't wake me till we get started,\" he said.\n\n\"We already have,\" returned Tom. \"Take a look.\"\n\nAstro's eyes popped open. He glanced through the clear crystal glass at\nthe rapidly moving landscape.\n\n\"These express jobs move on supercushioned ball bearings,\" explained\nTom. \"You can't even feel it when you pull out of the station.\"\n\n\"Blast my jets!\" marveled Astro. \"I'd sure like to take a look at the\npower unit on this baby.\"\n\n\"Even on a vacation, all this guy can think about is power!\" grumbled\nRoger.\n\n\"How about building up our own power,\" suggested Tom. \"It's a long haul\nto Atom City. Let's get a bite to eat.\"\n\n\"O.K. with me, spaceboy!\" Astro grinned. \"I could swallow a whole\nsteer!\"\n\n\"That's a great idea, cadet,\" said a voice from behind them.\n\nIt came from a gray-haired man, neatly dressed in the black one-piece\nstylon suit currently in fashion, and with a wide red sash around his\nwaist.\n\n\"Beg pardon, sir,\" said Tom, \"were you speaking to us?\"\n\n\"I certainly was,\" replied the stranger. \"I'm asking you to be my guests\nat dinner. And while I may not be able to buy your friend a whole steer,\nI'll gladly get him a piece of one.\"\n\n\"Hey,\" said Astro, \"do you think he means it?\"\n\n\"He seems to,\" replied Tom. He turned to the stranger. \"Thanks very\nmuch, sir, but don't think Astro was just kidding about his appetite.\"\n\n\"I'm sure he wasn't.\" The gray-haired man smiled, and came over and\nstretched out his hand. \"Then it's a deal,\" he said. \"My name's Joe\nBernard.\"\n\n\"Bernard!\" exclaimed Roger. He paled and glanced quickly at his two\nfriends, but they were too busy looking over their new friend to notice.\n\n\"Glad to know you, sir,\" said Tom. \"I'm Tom Corbett. This is Astro, from\nVenus. And over here is--\"\n\n\"Roger's my name,\" the third cadet said quickly. \"Won't you sit down,\nsir?\"\n\n\"No use wasting time,\" said Bernard. \"Let's go right into the dining\ncar.\" The cadets were in no mood to argue with him. They picked up the\nsmall microphones beside their chairs and sent food orders to the\nkitchen; and by the time they were seated in the dining car, their\norders were ready on the table.\n\nMr. Bernard, with a twinkle in his eye, watched them enjoy their food.\nIn particular, he watched Astro.\n\n\"I warned you, sir,\" whispered Tom, as the Venusian went to work on his\nsecond steak.\n\n\"I wouldn't have missed this for anything,\" said Bernard. He smiled, lit\na cigar of fine Mercurian leaf tobacco and settled back comfortably.\n\n\"And now,\" he said, \"let me explain why I was so anxious to have dinner\nwith you. I'm in the import-export business. Ship to Mars, mostly. But\nall my life I've wanted to be a spaceman.\"\n\n\"Well, what was the trouble, Mr. Bernard?\" asked Roger.\n\nThe man in black sighed. \"Couldn't take the acceleration, boys. Bad\nheart. I send out more than five hundred cargoes a year, to all parts of\nthe solar system; but myself, I've never been more than a mile off the\nsurface of the earth.\"\n\n\"It sure must be disappointing--to want to blast off, and know that you\ncan't,\" said Tom.\n\n\"I tried, once,\" said Bernard, with a rueful smile. \"Yup! I tried.\" He\ngazed thoughtfully out the window.\n\n\"When I was your age, about twenty, I wanted to get into Space Academy\nworse than anybody I'd ever met.\" He paused. \"Except for one person. A\nboyhood buddy of mine--named Kenneth--\"\n\n\"Excuse me, sir,\" cut in Roger quickly, \"but I think we'd better get\nback to our car. With this big liberty in front of us, we need a lot of\nrest.\"\n\n\"But, Roger!\" exclaimed Tom.\n\nBernard smiled. \"I understand, Roger. Sometimes I forget that I'm an old\nman. And when you've already tasted the excitement of space travel, talk\nlike mine must seem rather dull.\" He stood up and faced the three\ncadets. \"It's been very pleasant, Corbett, Astro, Roger. Now run along\nand get your rest. I'll just sit here for a while and watch the\nscenery.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said Tom, \"for the dinner--your company--and\neverything,\" he finished lamely.\n\nThere was a chorus of good-byes and the boys returned to their car. But\nthere was little conversation now. Gradually, the lights in the cars\ndimmed to permit sleep. But Tom kept listening to the subdued click of\nthe monorail--and kept wondering. Finally Roger, sleeping next to him,\nwakened for a moment.\n\n\"Roger,\" said Tom, \"I want to ask you something.\"\n\n\"Wait'll the mornin',\" mumbled Roger. \"Wanta sleep.\"\n\n\"The way you acted with Bernard,\" Tom persisted. \"You ate his dinner and\nthen acted like he was poison. Why was that, Roger?\"\n\nThe other sat bolt upright. \"Listen,\" he said. \"Listen!\" Then he\nslumped back in his chair and closed his eyes. \"Lemme sleep, Corbett.\nLemme sleep, I tell you.\" He turned his back and in a moment was making\nsounds of deep slumber, but Tom felt sure that Roger was not\nasleep--that he was wide awake, with something seriously bothering him.\n\nTom leaned back and gazed out over the passing plains and up into the\ndeep black of space. The Moon was full, large and round. He could\ndistinguish _Mare Imbrium_, the largest of Luna's flat plains visible\nfrom Earth, where men had built the great metropolis of Luna City.\nFarther out in the deep blackness, he could see Mars, glowing like a\npale ruby. Before long he would be up there again. Before long he would\nbe blasting off in the _Polaris_ with Astro and with Roger--\n\nRoger! Why had he acted so strangely at dinner?\n\nTom remembered the night he saw Roger in Galaxy Hall alone at night, and\nthe sudden flash on the field a few days before when they had won the\nmercuryball game. Was there some reason behind his companion's strange\nactions? In vain, Tom racked his brain to find the answer. There had to\nbe some explanation. Yet what could it possibly be? He tossed and turned\nand worried and finally--comfortable as the monorail car was--he fell\nasleep from sheer exhaustion.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAtom City! Built of the clear crystal mined so cheaply on Titan, moon of\nSaturn, Atom City had risen from a barren North American wasteland to\nbecome a show place of the universe. Here was the center of all space\ncommunications--a proud city of giant crystal buildings. Here had been\ndeveloped the first slidewalks, air cars, three-dimensional stereos and\nhundreds of other ideas for better living.\n\nAnd here at Atom City was the seat of the great Solar Alliance, housed\nin a structure which covered a quarter of a mile at its base and which\ntowered three thousand noble feet into the sky.\n\nThe three cadets stepped out of the monorail and walked across the\nplatform to a waiting air car--jet-powered, shaped like a teardrop and\nwith a clear crystal top.\n\n\"We want the best hotel in town,\" said Astro grandly to the driver.\n\n\"And get this speed bug outa here in a hurry,\" Roger told him. \"There's\na lot we want to do.\"\n\nThe driver couldn't help smiling at the three cadets so obviously\nenjoying their first leave.\n\n\"We've got three top hotels,\" he said. \"One's as good as the other.\nThey're the Earth, the Mars and the Venus.\"\n\n\"The Earth,\" voted Tom.\n\n\"The Mars,\" shouted Roger.\n\n\"The _Venus_!\" roared Astro.\n\n\"All right,\" said the driver with a laugh, \"make up your minds.\"\n\n\"Which of 'em is nearest the center of the city?\" Tom asked.\n\n\"The Mars.\"\n\n\"Then blast off for Mars!\" ordered Tom, and the air car shot away from\nthe station and moved up into the stream of expressway traffic fifty\nfeet above the ground.\n\nAs the little car sped along the broad avenue, Tom remembered how often,\nas a boy, he'd envied the Space Cadets who'd come to his home town of\nNew Chicago on leave. Now here _he_ was--in uniform, with a three-day\npass, and all of Atom City to enjoy it in.\n\nA few minutes later the air car stopped in front of the Mars Hotel. The\ncadets saw the entrance loom before them--a huge opening, with ornate\nglass and crystal in many different colors.\n\nThey walked across the high-ceilinged lobby toward the desk. All around\nthem, the columns that supported the ceiling were made of the clearest\ncrystal. Their feet sank into soft, lustrous deep-pile rugs made of\nVenusian jungle grass.\n\nThe boys advanced toward the huge circular reception desk where a pretty\ngirl with red hair waited to greet them.\n\n\"May I help you?\" she asked. She flashed a dazzling smile.\n\n\"You're a lucky girl,\" said Roger. \"It just so happens you _can_ help\nme. We'll have dinner together--just the two of us--and then we'll go to\nthe stereos. After which we'll--\"\n\nThe girl shook her head sadly. \"I can see your friend's got a bad case\nof rocket shock,\" she said to Tom.\n\n\"That's right,\" Tom admitted. \"But if you'll give us a triple room,\nwe'll make sure he doesn't disturb anybody.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Roger, \"go blow your jets!\"\n\n\"I have a nice selection of rooms here on photo-slides if you'd care to\nlook at them,\" the girl suggested.\n\n\"How many rooms in this hotel, Beautiful?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"Nearly two thousand,\" answered the girl.\n\n\"And you have photo-slides of all two thousand?\"\n\n\"Why, yes,\" answered the girl. \"Why do you ask?\"\n\n\"You and Astro go take a walk, Corbett,\" said Roger with a grin. \"I'll\nselect our quarters!\"\n\n\"You mean,\" asked the girl, a little flustered, \"you want to look at all\nthe slides?\"\n\n\"Sure thing, Lovely!\" said Roger with a lazy smile.\n\n\"But--but that would take three hours!\"\n\n\"Exactly my idea!\" said Roger.\n\n\"Just give us a nice room, Miss,\" said Tom, cutting in. \"And please\nexcuse Manning. He's so smart, he gets a little dizzy now and then.\nHave to take him over to a corner and revive him.\" He glanced at Astro,\nwho picked Roger up in his arms and walked away with him as though he\nwere a baby.\n\n\"Come on, you space Romeo!\" said Astro.\n\n\"Hey--ouch--hey--lemme go, ya big ape. You're killing your best friend!\"\nRoger twisted around in Astro's viselike grasp, to no avail.\n\n\"Space fever,\" explained Tom. \"He'll be O.K. soon.\"\n\n\"I think I understand,\" said the girl with a nervous smile.\n\nShe handed Tom a small flashlight. \"Here's your photoelectric light key\nfor room 2305 F. That's on the two hundred thirtieth floor.\"\n\nTom took the light key and turned toward the slidestairs where Astro was\nholding Roger firmly, despite his frantic squirming.\n\n\"Hey, Tom,\" cried Roger, \"tell this Venusian ape to let me go!\"\n\n\"Promise to behave yourself?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"We came here to have fun, didn't we?\" demanded Roger.\n\n\"That doesn't mean getting thrown out of the hotel because you've got to\nmake passes at every beautiful girl.\"\n\n\"What's the matter with beautiful girls?\" growled Roger. \"They're\nofficial equipment, like a radar scanner. You can't get along without\nthem!\"\n\nTom and Astro looked at each other and burst out laughing.\n\n\"Come on, you jerk,\" said Astro, \"let's get washed up. I wanta take a\nwalk and get something to eat. I'm hungry again!\"\n\nAn hour later, showered and dressed in fresh uniforms, the _Polaris_\ncrew began a tour of the city. They went to the zoo and saw dinosaurs, a\ntyrannosaurus, and many other monsters extinct on Earth millions of\nyears ago, but still breeding in the jungles of Tara. They visited the\ncouncil chamber of the Solar Alliance where delegates from the major\nplanets and from the larger satellites, such as Titan of Saturn,\nGanymede of Jupiter, and Luna of Earth made the laws for the\ntri-planetary league. The boys walked through the long halls of the\nAlliance building, looking at the great documents which had unified the\nsolar system.\n\nThey reverently inspected original documents of the Universal Bill of\nRights and the Solar Constitution, which guaranteed basic freedoms of\nspeech, press, religion, peaceful assembly and representative\ngovernment. And even brash, irrepressible Roger Manning was awestruck as\nthey tiptoed into the great Chamber of the Galactic Court, where the\nsupreme judicial body of the entire universe sat in solemn dignity.\n\nLater, the boys visited the Plaza de Olympia--a huge fountain, filled\nwith water taken from the Martian Canals, the lakes of Venus and the\noceans of Earth, and ringed by a hundred large statues, each one\nsymbolizing a step in mankind's march through space.\n\nBut then, for the Space Cadets, came the greatest thrill of all--a trip\nthrough the mighty Hall of Science, at once a museum of past progress\nand a laboratory for the development of future wonders.\n\nThousands of experiments were being conducted within this crystal\npalace, and as Space Cadets, the boys were allowed to witness a few of\nthem. They watched a project which sought to harness the solar rays more\neffectively; another which aimed to create a new type of fertilizer for\nMars, so people of that planet would be able to grow their own food in\ntheir arid deserts instead of importing it all from other worlds. Other\nscientists were trying to adapt Venusian jungle plants to grow on other\nplanets with a low oxygen supply; while still others, in the medical\nfield, sought for a universal antibody to combat all diseases.\n\nEvening finally came and with it time for fun and entertainment. Tired\nand leg weary, the cadets stepped on a slidewalk and allowed themselves\nto be carried to a huge restaurant in the heart of Atom City.\n\n\"Food,\" exulted Astro as the crystal doors swung open before them.\n\"Smell it! Real, honest-to-gosh food!\" He rushed for a table.\n\n\"Hold it, Astro,\" shouted Tom. \"Take it easy.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" added Roger. \"It's been five hours since your last meal--not\nfive weeks!\"\n\n\"Meal!\" snorted the Venusian cadet. \"Call four spaceburgers a meal? And\nanyway, it's been six hours, not five.\"\n\nLaughing, Tom and Roger followed their friend inside. Luckily, they\nfound a table not far from the door, where Astro grabbed the microphone\nand ordered his usual tremendous dinner.\n\nThe three boys ate hungrily as course after course appeared on the\nmiddle of the table, via the direct shaft from the kitchen. So absorbed\nwas Manning that he did not notice the approach of a tall dark young man\nof about his own age, dressed in the red-brown uniform of the Passenger\nSpace Service. But the young man, who wore a captain's high-billed hat,\nsuddenly caught sight of Roger.\n\n\"Manning,\" he called, \"what brings you here?\"\n\n\"Al James!\" cried Roger and quickly got up to shake hands. \"Of all the\nguys in the universe to show up! Sit down and have a bite with us.\"\n\nThe space skipper sat down. Roger introduced him to Tom and Astro. There\nwas a round of small talk.\n\n\"Whatever made you become a Space Cadet, Roger?\" asked James finally.\n\n\"Oh, you know how it is,\" said Roger. \"You can get used to anything.\"\n\nAstro almost choked on a mouthful of food. He shot a glance at Tom, who\nshook his head as though warning him not to speak.\n\nJames grinned broadly. \"I remember how you used to talk back home. The\nSpace Cadets were a bunch of tin soldiers trying to feel important. The\nAcademy was a lot of space gas. I guess, now, you've changed your mind.\"\n\n\"Maybe I have,\" said Roger. He glanced uneasily at his two friends, but\nthey pretended to be busy eating. \"Maybe I have.\" Roger's eyes narrowed,\nhis voice became a lazy drawl. \"At that it's better'n being a man in a\nmonkey suit, with nothing to do but impress the passengers and order\naround the crew.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" said James. \"What kind of a crack is that?\"\n\n\"No crack at all. Just the way I feel about you passenger gents who\ndon't know a rocket tube from a ray-gun nozzle.\"\n\n\"Look, Manning,\" returned James. \"No need to get sore, just because you\ncouldn't do any better than the Space Cadets.\"\n\n\"Blast off,\" shouted Roger, \"before I fuse your jets.\"\n\nTom spoke up. \"I think you'd better go, Captain.\"\n\n\"I've got six men outside,\" sneered the other. \"I'll go when I'm ready.\"\n\n\"You're ready now,\" spoke up Astro. He stood up to his full height. \"We\ndon't want any trouble,\" the cadet from Venus said, \"but we're not\nbraking our jets to get away from it, either.\"\n\nJames took a good look at Astro's powerful frame. Without another word\nhe walked away.\n\nTom shook his head. \"That pal of yours is a real Space Cadet fan, isn't\nhe, Roger?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Astro. \"Just like Manning is himself.\"\n\n\"Look,\" said Roger. \"Look, you guys--\" He hesitated, as though intending\nto say something more, but then he turned back to his dinner. \"Go\non--finish your food,\" he growled. He bent over his plate and ate\nwithout lifting his eyes. And not another word was spoken at the table\nuntil a young man approached, carrying a portable teleceiver screen.\n\n\"Pardon me,\" he said. \"Is one of you Cadet Tom Corbett?\"\n\n\"Why--I am,\" acknowledged Tom.\n\n\"There's a call for you. Seems they've been trying to reach you all over\nAtom City.\" He placed the teleceiver screen on the table, plugged it\ninto a floor socket and set the dials.\n\n\"Hope's there's nothing wrong at home,\" said Tom to his friends. \"My\nlast letter from Mom said Billy was messing around with a portable atom\nreactor and she was afraid he might blow himself up.\"\n\nA picture began to take shape on the screen. \"Migosh,\" said Astro. \"It's\nCaptain Strong.\"\n\n\"It certainly is,\" said the captain's image. \"Having dinner, eh, boys?\nUmmmm--those baked shrimps look good.\"\n\n\"They're terrific,\" said Astro. \"Wish you were here.\"\n\n\"Wish you could stay there,\" said Captain Strong.\n\n\"Oh, no!\" moaned Astro. \"Don't tell me!\"\n\n\"Sorry, boys,\" came the voice from the teleceiver. \"But that's it.\nYou've got to return to the Academy immediately. The whole cadet corps\nhas been ordered into space for special maneuvers. We blast off tomorrow\nmorning at six hundred.\"\n\n\"But, sir,\" objected Tom, \"we can't get a monorail until morning!\"\n\n\"This is an official order, Corbett. So you have priority over all\ncivilian transportation.\" The Solar Guard captain smiled. \"I've tied up\na whole bank of teleceivers in Atom City searching for you. Get back to\nSpace Academy fast--commandeer an air car if you must, but be here by\nsix hundred hours!\" The captain waved a cheery good-bye and the screen\nwent dark.\n\n\"Space maneuvers,\" breathed Astro. \"The real thing.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" agreed Tom. \"Here we go!\"\n\n\"Our first hop into deep space!\" said Roger. \"Let's get out of here!\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 12\n\n\n\"The following ships in Squadron A will blast off immediately,\" roared\nCommander Walters over the teleceiver. He looked up alertly from a chart\nbefore him in the Academy spaceport control tower. He began to name the\nships. \"_Capella_, orbital tangent--09834, _Arcturus_, orbital\ntangent--09835, _Centauri_, orbital tangent--09836, _Polaris_, orbital\ntangent--09837!\"\n\nAboard the space cruiser _Polaris_, Tom Corbett turned away from the\ncontrol board. \"That's us, sir,\" he said to Captain Strong.\n\n\"Very well, Corbett.\" The Solar Guard captain walked to the ship's\nintercom and flipped on the switch.\n\n\"Astro, Roger, stand by!\"\n\nAstro and Roger reported in. Strong began to speak. \"The cadet corps has\nbeen divided into squadrons of four ships each. We are command ship of\nSquadron A. When we reach free-fall space, we are to proceed as a group\nuntil eight hundred hours, when we are to open sealed orders. Each of\nthe other seven squadrons will open their orders at the same time. Two\nof the squadrons will then act as invaders while the remaining six will\nbe the defending fleet. It will be the invaders' job to reach their\nobjective and the defenders' job to stop them.\"\n\n\"Spaceport control to rocket cruiser _Polaris_, your orbit has been\ncleared for blast-off....\" The voice of Commander Walters interrupted\nStrong in his instructions and he turned back to Tom.\n\n\"Take over, Corbett.\"\n\nTom turned to the teleceiver. \"Rocket cruiser _Polaris_ to spaceport\ncontrol.\"\n\n\" ... Blast off minus two--six hundred forty-eight....\"\n\n\"I read you clear,\" said Tom. He clicked off the teleceiver and turned\nback to the intercom. \"Stand by to raise ship! Control deck to radar\ndeck. Do we have clear trajectory forward and up, Roger?\"\n\n\"All clear forward and up,\" replied Roger.\n\n\"Control deck to power deck ... energize the cooling pumps!\"\n\n\"Cooling pumps, aye,\" came from Astro.\n\nThe giant ship began to shudder as the mighty pumps on the power deck\nstarted their build.\n\nTom strapped himself into the pilot's seat and began checking the dials\nin front of him. Satisfied, he fastened his eyes on the sweep hand of\nthe time clock. Above his head, the teleceiver screen brought him a\nclear picture of the Academy spaceport. He watched the giant cruisers\ntake to the air one by one and rocket into the vastness of space.\n\nThe clock hand reached the ten-second mark.\n\n\"Stand by to raise ship!\" Tom called into the intercom. The red hand\nmoved steadily, inexorably. Tom reached for the master switch.\n\n\"Blast off minus--five--four--three--two--one--_zero_!\"\n\nTom threw the switch.\n\nThe great ship hovered above the ground for a few moments. Then it\nheaved itself skyward, faster and ever faster, pushing the Earthmen deep\ninto their acceleration cushions.\n\nReaching free-fall space, Tom flipped on the artificial-gravity\ngenerator. He felt its pull on his body, quickly checked all the\ninstruments and turned to Captain Strong.\n\n\"Ship space-borne at six hundred fifty-three, sir.\"\n\n\"Very well, Corbett,\" replied Strong. \"Check in with the _Arcturus_,\n_Capella_ and the _Centauri_, form up on one another and assume a course\nthat will bring you back over Academy spaceport at eight hundred hours,\nwhen we will open orders.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Tom, turning back eagerly to the control board.\n\nFor nearly two hours the four rocket ships of Squadron A moved through\nspace in a perfect arc, shaping up for the 0800 deadline. Strong made\nuse of the time to check a new astrogation prism perfected by Dr. Dale\nfor use at hyperspace speeds. Tom rechecked his instruments, then\nprepared hot tea and sandwiches in the galley for his shipmates.\n\n\"This is what I call service,\" said Astro. He stood stripped to the\nwaist, a wide leather belt studded with assorted wrenches of various\nshapes and sizes strapped around his hips. In one hand he carried a wad\nof waste cotton with which he continually polished the surfaces of the\natomic motors, while his eyes constantly searched the many gauges in\nfront of him for the slightest sign of engine failure.\n\n\"Never mind bringing anything up to Manning. I'll eat his share.\"\n\nAstro had deliberately turned the intercom on so Roger on the radar deck\nmight hear. The response from that corner was immediate and emphatic.\n\n\"Listen, you rocket-headed grease monkey,\" yelled Roger. \"If you so much\nas smell that grub, I'll come down and feed you into the reactant\nchamber!\"\n\nTom smiled at Astro and turned to the ladder leading up from the power\ndeck. Passing through the control deck on the way to the radar bridge,\nhe glanced at the clock. It was ten minutes to eight.\n\n\"Only one thing I'm worried about, Corbett,\" said Roger through a\nmouthful of sandwich.\n\n\"What's that?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"Collision!\" said Roger. \"Some of these space-happy cadets might get\nexcited, and I for one don't want to wind up as a flash in Earth's\natmosphere!\"\n\n\"Why, you have radar, to see anything that goes on.\"\n\n\"Oh, sure,\" said Roger, \"I can keep this wagon outa their way, but will\nthey stay outa mine? Why my father told me once--\" Roger choked on his\nfood and turned away to the radar screen.\n\n\"Well,\" said Tom after a moment, \"what _did_ your father tell you?\"\n\n\"Ah--nothing--not important. But I've got to get a cross-fix on Regulus\nbefore we start our little games.\"\n\nTom looked puzzled. Here was another of Roger's quick changes of\nattitude. What was it all about? But there was work to do, so Tom\nshrugged his shoulders and returned to the control deck. He couldn't\nforget what Roger had said about a collision, though.\n\n\"Excuse me, Captain,\" said Tom, \"but have there been any serious\ncollisions in space between ships?\"\n\n\"Sure have, Tom,\" replied Strong. \"About twenty years ago, maybe less,\nthere was a whole wave of them. That was before we developed\nsuperrebound pulse radar. The ships were faster than the radar at close\nrange.\"\n\nStrong paused. \"Why do you ask?\"\n\nBefore Tom could answer, there was a sharp warning from the captain.\n\n\"Eight o'clock, Corbett!\"\n\nTom ripped open the envelope containing the sealed orders.\n\"Congratulations,\" he read. \"You are in command of the defenders. You\nhave under your command, Squadrons A--B--C--D--E--F. Squadrons G and H\nare your enemies, and at this moment are on their way to attack Luna\nCity. It is your job to protect it and destroy the enemy fleet.\nSpaceman's luck! Walters, Commander Space Academy, Senior Officer Solar\nGuard.\"\n\n\"Roger,\" yelled Tom, \"we've been selected as flagship for the defenders!\nGet me a course to Luna City!\"\n\n\"Good for us, spaceboy. I'll give you that course in a jiffy!\"\n\n\" ... _Capella_ to _Polaris_--am standing by for your orders....\" Tony\nRichards' voice crackled over the teleceiver. One by one the\ntwenty-three ships that made up the defender's fleet checked in for\norders.\n\n\"Astro,\" shouted Tom, \"stand by for maneuver--and be prepared to give me\nevery ounce of thrust you can get!\"\n\n\"Ready, willing and able, Tom,\" replied Astro. \"Just be sure those other\nspace jockeys can keep up with me, that's all!\"\n\nTom turned to Captain Strong.\n\n\"What do you think of approaching--\"\n\nStrong cut him off. \"Corbett, you are in complete command. Take\nover--you're losing time talking to me!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\" said Tom. He turned back to the control board, his face\nflushed with excitement. Twenty-four ships to maneuver and the\nresponsibility all his own. Via a chart projected on a screen, he\nstudied various approaches to the Moon and Luna City. What would he do\nif he were in command of the invading fleet? He noticed the Moon was\nnearing a point where it would be in eclipse on Luna City itself. He\nstudied the chart further, made several notations and turned to the\nteleceiver.\n\n\"Attention--attention--flagship _Polaris_ to Squadrons B and C--proceed\nto chart seven--sectors eight and nine. You will patrol those sectors.\nAttention Squadrons D and F--proceed to Luna City at emergency space\nspeed, hover at one hundred thousand feet above Luna City spaceport and\nwait for further orders. Attention, ships three and four of Squadron\nF--you will proceed to chart six--sectors sixty-eight through\nseventy-five. Cut all rockets and remain there until further orders.\nThe remainder of Squadron F--ships one and two--will join Squadron A.\nSquadron A will stand by for further orders.\" Tom glanced at the clock\nand punched the intercom button.\n\n[Illustration: _\"Attention Squadrons D and F--proceed to Luna City\"_]\n\n\"Have you got that course, Roger?\"\n\n\"Three degrees on the starboard rockets, seventy-eight degrees on the\nup-plane of the ecliptic will put you at the corner of Luna Drive and\nMoonset Land in the heart of Luna City, spaceboy!\" answered Roger.\n\n\"Get that, Astro?\" asked Tom on the intercom.\n\n\"All set,\" replied Astro.\n\n\"Attention all ships in Squadron A--this is flagship--code name\nStarlight--am changing course. Stand by to form up on me!\"\n\nTom turned back to the intercom.\n\n\"Power deck, execute!\"\n\nAt more than five thousand miles an hour, the _Polaris_ hurtled toward\nits destination. One by one the remaining ships moved alongside until\nall six had their needlelike noses pointed toward the pale satellite of\nthe Moon.\n\n\"I'd like to know what your plans are, Tom,\" said Strong, when the long\nhaul toward the Moon had settled down to a routine. \"Just idle\ncuriosity, nothing more. You don't have to tell me if you don't want\nto.\"\n\n\"Golly, yes,\" said Tom, \"I'd be very grateful for your opinion.\"\n\n\"Well, let's have it,\" said the captain. \"But as for my opinion--I'll\nlisten, but I won't say anything.\"\n\nTom grinned sheepishly.\n\n\"Well,\" he began, \"if I were in command of the invading fleet, I would\nstrike in force--I'd have to, to do damage with only eight ships. There\nare three possible approaches to Luna City. One is from the Earth side,\nusing the eclipse corridor of darkness as protection. To meet that,\nI've stationed two ships at different levels and distances in that\ncorridor so that it would be impossible for an invasion to pass\nunnoticed.\"\n\n\"You mean, you'd be willing to give up two ships to the invader to have\nhim betray his position. Is that right?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. But I've also sent Squadrons B and C to sectors eight and\nnine on chart seven. So I have a roving squadron to go to their aid,\nshould the invader strike there. And on the other hand, should he manage\nto get through my outer defense, I have Squadrons D and E over Luna City\nitself as an inner defense. As for Squadron A, we'll try to engage the\nenemy first and maybe weaken him; at least reduce the full force of his\nattack. And then have Squadrons B, C, D and E finish him off, by attack\nfrom three different points.\"\n\nStrong nodded silently. The young cadet was shaping up a defensive\nstrategy with great skill. If he could only follow through on his plans,\nthe invaders of Luna City wouldn't have much chance of success--even if\nwilling to take heavy losses.\n\nRoger's voice came on. \"Got a report for you, Tom. From command ship,\nSquadron B. They've sighted the invaders and are advancing to meet\nthem.\"\n\nTom checked his charts and turned to the intercom.\n\n\"Send them this message, Roger,\" he said. \"From Starlight, to command\nship, Squadrons B and C--approach enemy ships from position of chart\nnineteen, sections one through ten.\"\n\n\"Right!\" said Roger.\n\nStrong smiled. Tom was driving his heaviest force between the invading\nfleet and its objective--forcing the aggressors into a trap.\n\nTom gave more crisp orders to his squadrons. He asked Roger for an\nestimated range, and then, rechecking his position, turned again to the\nintercom.\n\n\"Astro, how much could you get out of this baby by opening the by-pass\nbetween the cooling pumps and the reactant chamber? That'd mean feeding\nthe stuff into the motors only half cooled.\"\n\nStrong turned, started to speak, then clamped his lips together.\n\n\"Another quarter space speed, roughly,\" replied Astro, \"about fifteen\nhundred miles more an hour. Do you want me to do that?\"\n\n\"No, not now,\" replied Tom. \"Just wanted to know what I could depend on,\nif I get stuck.\"\n\n\"O.K.,\" said Astro. \"Let me know!\"\n\n\"Why use emergency speed, Corbett?\" asked Strong. \"You seem to have your\nenemy right where you want him now.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Tom. \"And the enemy knows I have him. He can't\npossibly attack Luna City now. But he can still run away. He can make\nhis escape by this one route.\"\n\nTom walked to the chart and ran his finger on a line away from the\ninvader's position into the asteroid belt.\n\n\"I don't want him to get away,\" Tom explained. \"And with the extra\nspeed, we can cut him off, force him to turn into a position where the\nremainder of my fleet would finish him off.\"\n\n\"You'll do this with just the _Polaris_?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, sir,\" said Tom. \"I'd use the _Arcturus_, _Capella_ and the\n_Centauri_, as well.\"\n\n\"Are you sure those other ships can equal your speed?\"\n\n\"They've got exactly the same type engines as we have here on the\n_Polaris_, sir. I'm sure they could--and with perfect safety.\"\n\nStrong hesitated a moment, started to ask a question, then stopped and\nwalked to the chart screen. He checked the figures. He checked them four\ntimes, then turned to Tom with a grin and an outstretched hand.\n\n\"I've got to offer my congratulations, Tom. This maneuver would wipe\nthem out. And I've got a notion that you'd come off without the loss of\na single ship, plus, and it is a big plus, keeping the invaders more\nthan fifty thousand miles away from their objective!\"\n\nThe captain turned to the teleceiver. \"Rocket cruiser _Polaris_ to\ncontrol tower at Space Academy--\"\n\nThere was a crackle of static and then the deep voice of Commander\nWalters boomed from the speaker.\n\n\"Spaceport control to _Polaris_. Come in, Steve.\"\n\nIn a few brief sentences, Strong outlined Tom's plan of action to the\nAcademy commander. The commander's face on the teleceiver widened into a\ngrin, then broke out in a hearty laugh.\n\n\"What's that, sir?\" asked Captain Strong.\n\n\"Very simple, Steve. All of us--all the Academy top brass--develop a\nfoolproof test for cadet maneuvers. And then your young Corbett makes us\nlook like amateurs.\"\n\n\"But didn't you expect one side or the other to win?\" asked Strong.\n\n\"Of course, but not like this. We've been expecting a couple of days of\nmaneuver, with both sides making plenty of mistakes that we could call\nthem on. But here Corbett wraps the whole thing up before we can get our\npencils sharpened.\"\n\n\"Better stuff cotton in Corbett's ears before he hears all this,\" rasped\nRoger Manning over the intercom. \"Or his head'll be too big to go\nthrough the hatch.\"\n\n\"Quiet, Manning,\" came Astro's voice from the power deck. \"Your mouth\nalone is bigger than Tom's head'll ever be.\"\n\n\"Look, you Venusian ape--\" began Roger, but Commander Walters' voice\nboomed out again. His face on the teleceiver screen was serious now.\n\n\"Attention! Attention all units! The battle has been fought and won on\nthe chart screen of the rocket cruiser _Polaris_. The Luna City attack\nhas been repelled and the invading fleet wiped out. All units and ships\nwill return to Space Academy at once. Congratulations to all and end\ntransmission.\"\n\nThe commander's face faded from the screen. Captain Strong turned to Tom.\n\"Good work,\" he said.\n\nHe was interrupted by a crackle of static from the teleceiver. A face\nsuddenly appeared on the screen--a man's face, frightened and tense.\n\n\"S O S.\" The voice rang out through the control deck.\n\n\"This is an S O S. Space passenger ship _Lady Venus_ requests assistance\nimmediately. Position is sector two, chart one hundred three. Emergency.\nWe must have--\"\n\nThe screen went blank, the voice stopped as though cut off by a knife.\nStrong frantically worked the teleceiver dials to re-establish contact.\n\n\"_Polaris_ to _Lady Venus_,\" he called. \"Come in _Lady Venus_. Rocket\ncruiser _Polaris_ calling _Lady Venus_. Come in! Come in!\"\n\nThere was no answer. The passenger ship's instruments had gone dead.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 13\n\n\n\"_Polaris_ to Commander Walters at Space Academy--Come in, Commander\nWalters!\" Captain Strong's voice was urgent in the teleceiver.\n\n\"Just worked up an assumed position on the _Lady Venus_,\" said Roger\nover the intercom. \"I think she's bearing about seventeen degrees to\nport of us, and about one-twenty-eight on the down-plane of the\necliptic.\"\n\n\"O.K., Roger,\" said Tom. \"Captain Strong's trying to reach Commander\nWalters now.\" He made a quick mental calculation. \"Golly, Roger--if\nyou've figured it right, we're closer to the _Lady Venus_ than anyone\nelse!\"\n\nThe teleceiver audio crackled.\n\n\"Commander Walters at Space Academy to Captain Strong on the _Polaris_.\nCome in, Steve!\"\n\n\"Commander!\" Strong's voice sounded relieved. \"Did you get that\nemergency from the _Lady Venus_--the S O S?\"\n\n\"Yes, we did, Steve,\" said the commander. \"How far away from her are\nyou?\"\n\nWithout a word, Tom handed Strong the position that Roger had computed.\nStrong relayed the information to the commander.\n\n\"If you're that close, go to her aid in the _Polaris_. You're nearer\nthan any Solar Guard patrol ship and you can do just as much.\"\n\n\"Right, sir,\" replied Steve. \"I'll report as soon as I get any news. End\ntransmission!\"\n\n\"Spaceman's luck, end transmission!\" said the commander.\n\n\"Have you got a course for us, Roger?\" asked Strong.\n\n\"Yes, sir!\"\n\n\"Then let's get out of here. I have a feeling there's something more\nthan just the usual emergency attached to that S O S from the _Lady\nVenus_.\"\n\nIn twenty seconds the mighty cruiser was blasting through space to the\naid of the stricken passenger ship.\n\n\"Better get the emergency equipment ready, Tom,\" said Strong. \"Space\nsuits for the four of us and every spare space suit you have on the\nship. Never can tell what we might run into. Also the first-aid surgical\nkit and every spare oxygen bottle. Oh, yeah, and have Astro get both jet\nboats ready to blast off immediately. I'll keep trying to pick them up\nagain on the teleceiver.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Tom sharply.\n\n\"What's going on up there?\" asked Astro, when Tom had relayed the orders\nfrom Captain Strong. Tom quickly told him of the emergency signal from\nthe _Lady Venus_.\n\n\"_Lady--Venus--_\" said the big cadet, rolling the name on his tongue, \"I\nknow her. She's one of the Martian City--Venusport jobs--an old-timer.\nConverted from a chemical burner to atomic reaction about three years\nago!\"\n\n\"Any ideas what the trouble might be?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"I don't know,\" replied Astro. \"There are a hundred and fifty things\nthat could go wrong--even on this wagon and she's brand new. But I\nwouldn't be surprised if it was on the power deck!\"\n\n\"And what makes you think so?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"I knew a spaceman once that was on a converted tub just like the _Lady\nVenus_ and he had trouble with the reaction chamber.\"\n\n\"Wow!\" exclaimed Tom. \"Let's hope it isn't that now!\"\n\n\"You can say that again,\" said Astro grimly. \"When this stuff gets out\nof control, there's very little you can do with it, except leave it\nalone and pile out!\"\n\nThe _Polaris_, rocketing through space at full space speed, plunged like\na silver bullet through the vastness of the black void, heading for what\nStrong hoped to be the _Lady Venus_. Tom prepared the emergency\nequipment, doubling all the reserves on the oxygen bottles by refilling\nthe empties he found on the ship and making sure that all space suits\nwere in perfect working order. Then he opened the emergency surgical kit\nand began the laborious task of examining every vial and drug in the kit\nto acquaint himself with what there was to work with just in case. He\nbrought all the stores of jelly out for radiation burns and finally\nopened a bottle of special sterilization liquid with which to wipe all\nthe instruments and vials clean. He checked the contents of the kit once\nmore, and, satisfied that everything was as ready as he could make it,\nhe went up to the control deck.\n\n\"Any other message from them yet, sir?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"Nothing yet,\" answered Strong. \"If I could pick them up on the\nteleceiver, maybe they could tell us what the trouble is and then we\ncould more or less be prepared to help them.\" He bent over the\nteleceiver screen and added grimly, \"If there is anything left to help!\"\n\n\"Radar deck to control deck!\" Roger's voice was tense. \"I think I've\npicked them up on the radar scanner, Captain Strong!\"\n\n\"Relay it down here to control-deck scanner, Manning,\" ordered Strong.\n\n\"Ummmh!\" murmured the captain when the screen began to glow. \"I'm pretty\nsure that's her. Here's that assumed position Roger worked up, Tom.\nCheck it against this one here on the scanner.\"\n\nTom quickly computed the position of the object on the scanner and\ncompared it to the position Roger had given them previously.\n\n\"If Roger's positioning was correct, sir,\" said Tom, \"then that's the\n_Lady Venus_. They both check out perfectly!\"\n\nStrong, bent over the radar scanner, didn't answer. Finally he turned\naround and flipped off the scanner. \"That's her,\" he announced.\n\"Congratulations, Roger. You hit it right on the nose!\"\n\n\"How shall we approach her, sir?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"We'd better wait until she sends up her flares.\"\n\n\"You mean the identification flares for safety factors?\"\n\n\"That's right,\" replied Strong. \"A white flare means it's all right to\ncome alongside and couple air locks. A red one means to stand off and\nwait for instructions.\" Strong turned to the intercom.\n\n\"Control deck to power deck. Reduce thrust to one quarter space speed!\"\n\n\"Power deck, aye,\" answered Astro.\n\n\"We'll wait until we're about two miles away from her and then use our\nbraking jets in the bow of the ship to bring us within a few thousand\nfeet of her,\" commented Strong.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Tom.\n\n\"Work up an estimated range, Roger,\" said Strong, \"and give me a\ndistance on our approach.\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" Roger replied. \"Objective four miles away now, sir.\"\n\n\"When we hit three miles,\" said Strong to Tom, \"have Astro stand by the\nforward braking jets.\"\n\n\"Aye, sir,\" said Tom.\n\n\"Three-and-a-half miles,\" said Roger a few moments later. \"Closing in\nfast. _Lady Venus_ looks like a dead ship.\"\n\n\"That could only mean one thing,\" said Strong bitterly. \"There has been\na power-deck failure of some sort.\"\n\n\"Three miles to objective, sir,\" reported Roger. \"I think I can pick her\nup on the teleceiver now, but only one way, from us to her.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Strong, \"see what you can do.\"\n\nIn a few moments the teleceiver screen glowed and then the silver\noutline of the _Lady Venus_ appeared on the screen.\n\n\"I don't see any damage to her hull,\" said Strong half to himself. \"So\nif it was an explosion, it wasn't a bad one.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Tom. \"Shall I stand by with the flares?\"\n\n\"Better send up a yellow identification flare, identifying us as the\nSolar Guard. Let them know who we are!\"\n\nTom turned to the yellow button on his left and pressed it. Immediately\na white flash resembling a meteor appeared on the teleceiver screen.\n\n\"There should be an answer soon,\" said Strong.\n\n\"Three thousand yards to objective,\" reported Roger.\n\n\"Fire braking rockets one half,\" ordered Strong.\n\nTom relayed the order to Astro and made the necessary adjustments on the\ncontrol panel.\n\n\"Stern drive rockets out,\" ordered Strong.\n\nOnce again Tom relayed the message to Astro and turned to the control\nboard.\n\n\"Cut all rockets!\" ordered Strong sharply.\n\nThe great ship, slowed by the force of the braking rockets, became\nmotionless in space a bare five hundred yards from the _Lady Venus_.\n\n\"They should be sending up their safety-factor flare soon,\" said Strong.\n\"Keep trying to raise them on the teleceiver, Roger.\"\n\nStrong was peering through a crystal port directly at the ship hanging\ndead in space opposite them. There wasn't any sign of life. Tom stepped\nto the side of Steve Strong and looked out at the crippled passenger\nship.\n\n\"Why don't we go aboard, sir?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"We'll wait a little longer for the flare. If we don't get it soon--\"\n\n\"There it is, sir!\" shouted Tom at Strong's side.\n\nFrom the flare port near the nose of the commercial ship, a ball of fire\nstreaked out.\n\n\"Red!\" said Strong grimly, \"That means we can't go alongside. We'll have\nto use jet boats.\"\n\n\"Captain Strong,\" shouted Roger from the radar deck, \"they're signaling\nus with a small light from the upper port on the starboard side!\"\n\n\"Can you read it?\" asked Strong quickly.\n\n\"I think so, sir. They're using standard space code, but the light is\nvery dim.\"\n\n\"What do they say?\"\n\n\" ... reaction ... chamber--\" said Roger slowly as he read the blinking\nlight, \" ... radiation ... leaking around ... baffle ... all ...\nsafe....\" Roger stopped. \"That's all, sir. I couldn't get the rest of\nit.\"\n\nStrong turned to the intercom. \"Astro, get the jet boats ready to blast\noff immediately. Roger, send this message. 'Am coming aboard. Stand by\nto receive me on your number-one starboard jet-boat catapult deck,\nsigned, Strong, Captain, Solar Guard.'\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\" replied Roger.\n\n\"Get into your space suit, Tom, and give Astro a hand with the jet\nboats. I have to get a message back to Space Academy and tell them to\nsend out help right away.\"\n\n\"Aye, sir,\" said Tom.\n\n\"Roger,\" said Strong, \"stand by to record this message for the\nteleceiver in case Space Academy should call our circuit while we're off\nthe ship.\"\n\n\"All set, sir,\" came the reply from the radar deck.\n\n\"O.K.--here goes--Captain Steve Strong--Solar Guard--am boarding\npassenger ship _Lady Venus_. Secondary communications signal message\nreceived indicates it is power-deck failure. Am taking cadets Corbett,\nManning and Astro and boarding same at\"--he paused and glanced at the\nclock--\"thirteen hundred fifty one hours!\"\n\n\"That all, sir?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"That's it. Get that set on the open circuit for any one calling us,\nthen climb into your space suit!\"\n\nIn a matter of minutes, the four spacemen of the _Polaris_ crew were\nmaking last-minute adjustments on their space suits. Astro picked up his\nheavy belt of tools and strapped them around his waist.\n\n\"What's that for, Astro?\" asked Strong. \"They'll have tools aboard the\nship if we need them.\"\n\n\"If that lead baffle in the reaction chamber has worked loose, sir, the\nodds are ten to one that the control chamber is flooded with radiation.\nAnd if it is, the tools are probably so hot you couldn't use them.\"\n\n\"That's good thinking, Astro,\" complimented Strong. He turned to Tom and\nRoger and checked their suits and the oxygen supply and feeder valves on\ntheir backs. He then turned his back while Tom checked his, and Roger\nadjusted Astro's.\n\n\"All right, turn on your communicators and test them,\" ordered Strong.\n\nOne by one the boys flipped on the switch of the portable spacephones in\ntheir fish-bowl helmets and spoke to each other. Strong indicated that\nhe was satisfied and turned toward the jet-boat catapult deck, the three\nboys following him in single file.\n\n\"Astro, you and Roger take number-one boat,\" said Strong. \"Tom and I\nwill take number two.\" His voice had a harsh metallic tone through the\nheadset spacephones.\n\nRoger hurried along with Astro to the number-one boat and climbed\ninside.\n\n\"Jet boat has its own oxygen system,\" said Astro to Roger. \"Better make\nuse of it while we're in here and save our suits' supplies.\"\n\n\"Good idea,\" said Roger. He locked the clear plastic airtight covering\nof the jet boat and began flicking at the control buttons.\n\n\"Strap in, you Venusian hick. Here we go!\" Roger shoved a lever at his\nside, making the jet-boat deck airtight from the rest of the _Polaris_,\nand then, by pressing a button on the simple control board, a section of\nthe _Polaris_' hull slipped back, exposing them to empty space.\n\nThe controls of a jet boat were simplicity itself. A half-moon wheel for\nguiding, up, down and either side, and two pedals on the floor, one for\ngoing and one for stopping. Roger stepped on the \"Go\" pedal and the\nsmall ship flashed out into the darkness of space.\n\nAlmost immediately on the opposite side of the _Polaris_, Captain Strong\nand Tom in the second boat shot away from the rocket cruiser and both\nboats headed for the stricken spaceship.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 14\n\n\nThe hatch clanked shut behind them. Inside the huge air lock of the\n_Lady Venus_, Tom, Roger, Astro and Captain Strong waited for the oxygen\nto equal the pressure in their space suits before removing their\nfish-bowl space helmets.\n\n\"O.K., sir,\" said Tom, \"pressure's equal.\"\n\nStrong stepped to the hatch leading to the inside of the ship and pushed\nhard. It slid to one side.\n\n\"How many jet boats do you have?\" was the first thing Strong heard as he\nstepped through the door to the interior of the passenger ship.\n\n\"Al James!\" cried Manning. \"So this is your tub?\"\n\nThe startled young skipper, whom Tom, Roger and Astro had met in Atom\nCity, turned to face the blond-headed cadet.\n\n\"Manning!\" he gasped.\n\n\"What's your trouble, skipper?\" asked Strong of the young spaceship\ncaptain.\n\nBefore James could answer there was a sudden clamor from beyond the next\nhatch leading to the main passenger cabin. Suddenly the hatch was jerked\nopen and a group of frightened men and women poured through. The first\nto reach Strong, a short fat man with a moonface and wearing glasses,\nbegan to jabber hysterically, while clinging to Strong's arm.\n\n\"Sir, this ship is going to blow up any moment. You've got to save us!\"\nHe turned to face Al James. \"And he refused to allow us to escape in the\njet boats!\" He pointed an accusing finger at the young skipper as the\nother passengers loudly backed him up.\n\n\"Just a moment,\" snapped Strong. \"There's a Solar Guard rocket cruiser\nonly five hundred yards away, so take it easy and don't get hysterical.\nNo one is going to get hurt if you keep calm and obey orders!\" He turned\nto James. \"What's the trouble, skipper?\"\n\n\"It's the reaction chamber. The lead baffle around the chamber worked\nloose and flooded everything with radiation. Now the mass in\nnumber-three rocket is building and wildcatting itself. If it gets any\nhigher, it'll explode.\"\n\n\"Why didn't your power-deck man dump the mass?\" asked Strong.\n\n\"We didn't know it was wildcatting until after he had tried to repair\nit. And he didn't tighten the bolts enough to keep it from leaking\nradiation.\" The young skipper paused. \"He lived long enough to warn us,\nthough.\"\n\n\"What's the Geiger count on the radiation?\" asked Strong.\n\n\"Up to twelve thirty-two--about ten minutes ago,\" answered James. \"I\npulled everybody out of the power deck and cut all energy circuits,\nincluding the energizing pumps. We didn't have any power so I had to use\nthe combined juice of the three jet boats to send out the emergency\nsignal that you picked up.\" He turned to face the little man with the\nglasses. \"I had a choice of either saving about fifteen passengers on\nthe jet boats, and leaving the others, or take a chance on saving\neverybody by using the power to send out a message.\"\n\n\"Ummmmh,\" said Strong to himself. He felt confidence in a young spaceman\nwho would take a decision like that on himself. \"What was that Geiger\ncount again?\" he asked.\n\n\"Must be better than fourteen hundred by now,\" answered James.\n\nStrong made a quick decision.\n\n\"All right,\" he said, tight-lipped, \"abandon ship! How many passengers?\"\n\n\"Seventeen women and twenty-three men including the crew,\" replied\nJames.\n\n\"Does that include yourself?\" asked Strong.\n\n\"No,\" came the reply.\n\nStrong felt better. Any man who would not count himself on a list to\nsurvive could be counted on in any emergency.\n\n\"We'll take four women at a time in each jet boat first,\" said Strong.\n\"James, you and I will operate the jet boats and ferry the passengers to\nthe _Polaris_. Tom, you and Roger and Astro get everybody aboard the\nship ready to leave.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Tom.\n\n\"We haven't much time. The reaction mass is building fast. Come on,\nJames, we have to rip out the seats in the jet boats to get five people\nin them.\" Strong turned back into the jet-boat launching well.\n\n\"May I have the passenger lists, Captain?\" asked Tom, turning to James.\nThe young skipper handed him a clip board with the names of the\npassengers and crew and followed Strong.\n\n\"We will abandon ship in alphabetical order,\" announced Tom. \"Miss Nancy\nAnderson?\"\n\nA young girl about sixteen stepped forward.\n\n\"Just stand there by the hatch, Miss,\" said Tom. He glanced at the next\nname. \"Miss Elizabeth Anderson?\" Another girl, looking very much like\nthe first, stepped forward and stood beside her sister.\n\n\"Mrs. John Bailey?\" called Tom.\n\nA gray-haired woman of about sixty stepped forward.\n\n\"Pardon me, sir, but I would rather remain with my husband, and go later\nwith him.\"\n\n\"No--no, Mary,\" pleaded an elderly man, holding his arm around her\nshoulder. \"Go now. I'll be all right. Won't I, sir?\" He looked at Tom\nanxiously.\n\n\"I can't be sure, sir,\" said Tom. He found it difficult to control his\nvoice as he looked down at the old couple, who couldn't weigh more than\ntwo hundred pounds between them.\n\n\"I'm going to stay,\" said the woman firmly.\n\n\"As you wish, Madam,\" said Tom. He looked at the list again. \"Mrs. Helen\nCarson?\"\n\nA woman about thirty-five, carrying a young boy about four years old,\nstepped out and took her place beside the two sisters.\n\nIn a moment, the first eight passengers were assembled into two groups,\nhelped into space suits, with a special portable suit for the little\nboy, and loaded in the jet boats. The red light over the hatch glowed,\nthen went out. The first load of passengers had left the _Lady Venus_.\n\n\"They're pretty jumpy,\" Roger whispered, nodding toward the remaining\npassengers.\n\n\"Yeah,\" answered Tom. \"Say, where's Astro?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Probably went to take a look at the jet boats to see if\none could be repaired so we'd have a third ferry running.\"\n\n\"Good idea,\" said Tom. \"See if you can't cheer these people up, Roger.\nTell them stories or sing songs--or better yet, get them to sing. Try to\nmake them forget they're sitting on an atom bomb!\"\n\n\"I can't forget it myself,\" said Roger. \"How can I make them forget it?\"\n\n\"Try anything. I'll go see if I can't give Astro a hand!\"\n\nRoger turned to face the assembled passengers and smiled. All around\nhim in the main passenger lounge, the frightened men and women sat\nhuddled together in small groups, staring at him, terror in their eyes.\n\n\"Ladieeees and Gentlemen,\" began Roger. \"You are now going to be\nentertained by the loudest, corniest and most miserable voice in the\nuniverse. I'm going to _sing_!\"\n\nHe waited for a laugh, but there was only a slight stir as the\npassengers shifted nervously in their seats.\n\nShrugging his shoulders, Roger took a deep breath and began to sing. He\nonly knew one song and he sang it with gusto.\n\n    \"From the rocket fields of the Academy\n    To the far-flung stars of outer space,\n    We're Space Cadets training to be....\"\n\nOn the lower deck of the passenger ship, Tom smiled as he faintly heard\nhis unit-mate's voice. He made his way to the jet-boat deck of the _Lady\nVenus_ and opened the hatch.\n\n\"Hey, Astro,\" he called. There wasn't any answer.\n\nHe stepped inside and looked around the empty deck. Walking over to one\nof the jet boats, he saw evidence of Al James's attempts to send out\nemergency signal messages. He called again. \"Hey, Astro--where are you?\"\nStill no answer. He noticed that one of the jet boats was missing. There\nwere three still on the deck, but an empty catapult for the fourth made\nTom think that Astro might have repaired the fourth and taken it out in\nspace for a test. The light over the escape hatch indicated that someone\nhad gone out. It was odd, thought Tom, for Astro to go out alone. But\nthen he shrugged, remembering how Astro could lose himself in his work\nand forget everything but the job at hand. He climbed back to the\npassenger deck.\n\nWhen Tom opened the hatch to the main lounge, the sight that filled his\neyes was so funny that, even in the face of danger, he had to laugh.\nRoger, with his hands clasped behind his back, was down on his knees\ntrying to push a food pellet across the deck with his nose. The whole\npassenger lounge echoed with hysterical laughter.\n\nSuddenly the laughter was stopped by the sound of the bell over the\nair-lock hatch. Strong and James had returned to ferry more passengers\nto the _Polaris_. Immediately the fun was forgotten and the passengers\ncrowded around for the roll call.\n\n\"Where's Astro?\" asked Strong, as he reappeared in the lounge.\n\n\"He's down on the jet-boat deck, sir, trying to fix another one,\"\nreplied Tom. \"I think he's out testing one now.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Strong. \"How're they taking it?\" He indicated the\npassengers.\n\n\"Roger's been keeping them amused with games and songs, sir,\" said Tom\nproudly.\n\n\"They'll need it. I don't mind telling you, Corbett,\" said Strong, \"it's\na wonder to me this tub hasn't blown up already.\"\n\nIn less than a half hour, the forty passengers and crewmen of the _Lady\nVenus_ were transferred in alphabetical order to the waiting _Polaris_.\nRoger kept up a continual line of patter and jokes and stories, making a\nfool of himself, but keeping the remaining passengers amused and their\nminds off the dangers of the rapidly building reaction mass.\n\n\"Just one passenger left,\" said Strong, \"with myself and you three. I\nthink we can squeeze five in that jet boat and get off here.\"\n\n\"That's for me,\" said Roger. \"I'm the only man in the whole universe\nthat's ever played to a packed house sitting on top of an atomic bomb!\"\n\n\"All right, Barrymore,\" said Strong, \"get aboard!\"\n\n\"Say,\" asked Tom, \"where's Astro?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" replied Roger. \"I thought you went to find him half an\nhour ago!\"\n\n\"I did,\" said Tom, \"but when I went to the jet-boat deck, one was\nmissing. So I figured he had fixed one and taken it out for a test.\"\n\n\"Then he's probably outside in space now!\" said Strong. Suddenly the\nSolar Guard captain caught himself. \"Wait a minute! How many jet boats\nwere on the deck, Corbett?\"\n\n\"Three, sir.\"\n\n\"Then Astro is still aboard the ship,\" said Strong. \"He couldn't have\ntaken a boat. James told me he couldn't repeat the message he sent out\nbecause he only had the power of _three_ jet boats. One was damaged and\nleft behind at Atom City!\"\n\n\"By the rings of Saturn,\" said Roger, \"a coupla million miles from home,\nsitting on an atomic bomb and that big Venusian hick decides to play\nhide-and-seek!\"\n\n\"Never mind the cracks,\" said Strong. \"We've got to find him!\"\n\n\"Captain,\" said the little man with the round face and glasses who had\nfirst spoken to Strong when he came aboard, \"just because my name\nhappens to be Zewbriski, and I have to be the very last to get on a jet\nboat, I don't see why I have to wait any longer. I demand to be taken\noff this ship immediately! I refuse to risk my life waiting around for\nsome foolish cadet!\"\n\n\"That foolish cadet, Mr. Zewbriski,\" said Strong coldly, \"is a human\nbeing like you and we don't budge until we find him!\"\n\nAt that moment the bell began to ring, indicating that the outer hatch\nto the air lock was opening.\n\n\"By the craters of Luna,\" said Tom, \"that must be Astro now!\"\n\n\"But if it is,\" said Roger, \"how did he get out there?\"\n\nFrom behind them, the hatch to the inner air lock opened and Al James\nstepped through.\n\n\"Captain Strong,\" he said excitedly, \"you've got to come quickly. Some\nof the crewmen have broken into your arms locker and taken paralo-ray\nguns. They threaten to leave you here if you don't return to the ship\nwithin five minutes. They're afraid the _Venus_ might blow up and damage\nthe _Polaris_ at this close range.\" The young skipper, his red-brown\nuniform torn and dirty, looked at the Solar Guard captain with wild-eyed\ndesperation.\n\n\"They can't leave us here,\" whimpered Zewbriski. \"We'll all be blown to\nbits!\"\n\n\"Shut up!\" barked Strong. He turned to Tom and Roger. \"I can do one of\ntwo things,\" he said. \"I can order you to return to the _Polaris_ now,\nwith James and myself, or you can volunteer to stay behind and search\nfor Astro.\"\n\nWithout looking at Roger, Tom answered, \"We'll stay, sir. And we won't\nhave to search for him. I think I know where he is.\"\n\n\"Now that I think about it,\" replied Strong, \"I guess there is only one\nplace he could be.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Tom, \"down on the power deck trying to save this wagon!\nCome on, Roger! Let's get him!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 15\n\n\n\"What's the reading on the Geiger counter now?\" asked Tom.\n\nRoger looked down at the face of the radioactive measuring device and\nanswered, \"She's been dropping for the last five minutes, Tom. Looks\nlike the mass in number three is cooling off. Fourteen hundred and ten\nnow.\"\n\n\"That's not fast enough,\" said Astro, straightening up from tightening a\nnut on the lead baffle. \"She's still plenty hot. That mass should have\nbeen dumped out of the rocket exhaust right away. Now the whole tube\ncontrol box is so hot with radiation, it'd burn you to a crisp if you\nopened the hatch.\"\n\n\"Good thing you brought along those tools from the _Polaris_,\" said Tom.\n\n\"Yeah, greaseball,\" said Roger, \"you used your head for once. Now let's\nsee you use it again and pile out of this hunk of junk!\"\n\n\"Fifteen hundred on the counter is the danger mark, Roger, and as long\nas we keep it under that, I'm going to try and save this wagon!\" replied\nAstro.\n\n\"Why? To get yourself a Solar Medal?\" asked Roger sarcastically.\n\n\"What do you think made this tub act up like this, Astro?\" asked Tom,\nignoring Roger's remark.\n\n\"Using special reactant feed, Tom,\" replied Astro. \"This is a converted\nchemical burner--with an old-type cooling pump. It's touchy stuff.\"\n\n\"Well, couldn't we drive boron rods into the mass and slow down the\nreaction?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"No, Tom,\" answered Astro, \"the control for the rods are inside the tube\ncontrol box. We can't reach it.\"\n\nThere was a sudden loud ticking from the Geiger counter.\n\n\"Astro!\" cried Roger. \"The mass is building!\"\n\n\"Here, lemme see!\" shouted Astro. He took the instrument in his big hand\nand watched the clocklike face intently.\n\n\" ... fourteen hundred thirty--fourteen hundred fifty--fourteen hundred\nseventy--\" He faced his unit-mates. \"Well, that does it. The mass is\nmaintaining a steady reaction without the energizing pumps. It's\nsustaining itself!\"\n\n\"But how is that possible?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"It's one of those freaks, Tom. It's been known to happen before. The\nfuel is just hot enough to sustain a steady reaction because of its high\nintensity. Once that baffle worked loose, the mass started wildcatting\nitself.\"\n\n\"And if it doesn't stop?\" asked Roger tensely.\n\n\"It'll reach a point where the reaction comes so fast it'll explode!\"\n\n\"Let's pile out of here!\" said Roger.\n\nThe three boys made a dash for their space suits and the jet boat.\nInside the air lock, they adjusted their oxygen valves and waited for\npressure to equalize so they could blast off.\n\n\"Blast it,\" said Astro, \"there must be some way to get to that rocket\ntube and dump that stuff!\"\n\n\"Impossible, Astro,\" said Roger. \"The release controls are in the\ncontrol box, and with all that radiation loose, you wouldn't last half a\nminute!\"\n\nTom walked over to the valve that would open the outside hatch.\n\n\"Wonder how Captain Strong is making out with those tough babies on the\n_Polaris_?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"I don't know,\" replied Roger, \"but anything would be better than\nsitting around waiting for this thing to blow up!\"\n\n\"Ah--stop griping,\" said Astro, \"or I'll shove you up a rocket tube and\nblast you from here all the way back to Atom City!\"\n\n\"Hey, wait a minute!\" shouted Tom. \"Astro, remember the time we were on\nthe ground crew as extra duty and we had to overhaul the _Polaris_?\"\n\n\"Yeah, why?\"\n\n\"There was one place you couldn't go. You were too big, so I went in,\nremember?\"\n\n\"Yeah, the space between the rocket tubes and the hull of the ship. It\nwas when we were putting in the new tube. So what?\"\n\n\"So this!\" said Tom. \"When they converted this tub, they had standard\nexhausts, so it must have the same layout as the _Polaris_. Suppose I\nclimb in the main exhaust, between the tube and the outer hull, and cut\naway the cleats that hold the tube to the ship?\"\n\n\"Why, then everything would come out in one piece!\" Astro's face lit up.\n\"Reactant mass, tube, control box--the works!\"\n\n\"Say, what are you two guys talking about?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"Saving a ship, Roger,\" said Tom. \"Dumping the whole assembly of the\nnumber-three rocket!\"\n\n\"Ah--you're space happy!\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" said Tom, \"but I think it's worth trying. How about it, Astro?\"\n\n\"O.K. by me, Tom,\" replied Astro.\n\n\"Good. You get the cutting torches rigged, Astro. Roger, you give him a\nhand and keep your eye on the counter. Then feed the torches to me when\nI get inside the tube. I'm going outside to get rid of a bad rocket and\nsave a five-million-credit spaceship!\"\n\nBefore Astro or Roger could protest, Tom opened the hatch and began to\nclimb out on the steel hull toward the rocket tubes, main exhaust.\n\nHis magnetic-soled shoes gripping the smooth steel hull, the cadet made\nhis way aft to the stern of the ship and began the climb down around the\nhuge firing tubes and into the tubes themselves.\n\n\"Hey, Astro,\" he yelled into the spacephone, \"I'm inside the tubes. How\nabout those torches?\" The cadets had adjusted the wave length so that\nall could hear what was said.\n\n\"Take it easy, spaceboy,\" said Roger, \"I'm leaving the hatch now. You\nand your fatheaded friend from Venus are so hopped up for getting a\nSolar Medal--\"\n\n\"Knock it off, Manning!\" said Astro from inside the ship. \"And for your\ninformation, I don't want a medal. I don't want anything except for you\nto stop griping!\"\n\nRoger reached the end of the ship and began to climb down inside the\ntube where Tom was waiting for him.\n\n\"O.K., spaceboy,\" said Roger, \"here're your cutting torches.\" He started\nmoving back. \"I'll see you around. I don't mind being a little hero for\nsaving people and all that stuff. But not for any ship. And the odds\nagainst a big hero staying alive are too big!\"\n\n\"Roger, wait,\" shouted Tom. \"I'll need....\" And then the curly-headed\ncadet clamped his teeth together and turned back to the task at hand.\n\nHe made adjustments on the nozzle of the cutting torch, and then,\nfocusing his chest light, called to Astro.\n\n\"O.K., Astro,\" he said, \"shoot me the juice!\"\n\n\"Coming up, Tom!\" answered Astro. \"And wait till I get my hands on that\nManning! I'm going to smear that yellow space crawler from one corner of\nthe universe to another!\"\n\n\"Never mind the talk,\" snarled Roger, who at the moment was re-entering\nthe tube. \"Just get that juice down to this torch and make it fast!\"\n\nTom turned to see Roger crawling back into the tube and adjusting a\ncutting torch.\n\n\"Glad to have you aboard, Roger,\" said Tom with a smile that Roger could\nnot see in the darkness of the tube. The two boys went to work.\n\nSuddenly the torches came to life. And immediately Tom and Roger began\nto cut away at the cleats that held the tube lining to the skin of the\nship. Steadily, the cadets worked their way up toward the center of the\nship, cutting anything that looked as though it might hold the giant\ntube to the ship.\n\n\"Boy,\" said Tom, \"it's getting hot in here!\"\n\nFrom inside the ship, Astro's reassuring voice came back in answer.\n\"You're getting close to the reactant-mass chamber. The last cleat is up\nby one of the exhaust gratings. Think you can last it?\"\n\n\"Well, if he can't,\" snarled Roger, \"he's sure to get that medal\nanyway!\" He inched up a little. \"Move over, Corbett, I'm skinnier than\nyou are, and I can reach that cleat easier than you can.\"\n\nRoger slipped past Tom and inched his way toward the last cleat. He\npulled his torch up alongside and pulled the trigger. The flame shot out\nand began eating the steel. In a moment the last cleat was cut and the\ntwo boys started their long haul down the tube to the outside of the\nship.\n\nAs they walked across the steel surface, back to the air lock, Tom stuck\nout his hand.\n\n\"I'm glad you came back, Roger.\"\n\n\"Save it for the boys that fall for that stuff, Corbett,\" said Roger\nsarcastically. \"I came back because I didn't want you and that Venusian\nhick to think you're the only ones with guts around here!\"\n\n\"No one has ever accused you of not having guts, Roger.\"\n\n\"Ah--go blast your jets,\" snarled Roger.\n\nThey went directly to the power deck where Astro was waiting for them,\nthe Geiger counter in his hand.\n\n\"All set to get rid of the rotten apple?\" he asked with a smile.\n\n\"All set, Astro,\" said Tom. \"What's the count?\"\n\n\"She seems to have steadied around fourteen hundred ninety--and believe\nme, the ten points to the official danger mark of fifteen hundred is so\nsmall that we could find out where the angels live any moment now!\"\n\n\"Then what're we waiting for,\" said Tom. \"Let's dump that thing!\"\n\n\"How?\" snarled Roger.\n\nTom and Astro looked at him bewilderedly. \"What do you mean 'how'?\"\nasked Astro.\n\n\"I mean how are you going to get the tube out of the ship?\"\n\n\"Why,\" started Tom, \"there's nothing holding that tube assembly to the\nship now. We cut all the cleats, remember? We can jettison the whole\nunit!\"\n\n\"It seems to me,\" drawled Roger lazily, \"that the two great heroes in\ntheir mad rush for the Solar Medal have forgotten an unwritten law of\nspace. There's no gravity out here--no natural force to pull or push the\ntube. The only way it could be moved is by the power of thrust, either\nforward or backward!\"\n\n\"O.K. Then let's push it out, just that way,\" said Astro.\n\n\"How?\" asked Roger cynically.\n\n\"Simple, Roger,\" said Tom, \"Newton's Laws of motion. Everything in\nmotion tends to keep going at the same speed unless influenced by an\noutside force. So if we blasted our nose rockets and started going\nbackward, everything on the ship would go backward too, then if we\nreversed--\"\n\nAstro cut in, \"Yeah--if we blasted the stern rockets, the ship would go\nforward, but the tube, being loose, would keep going the other way!\"\n\n\"There's only one thing wrong,\" said Roger. \"That mass is so hot now, if\nany booster energy hit it, it would be like a trigger on a bomb. It'd\nblow us from here to the next galaxy!\"\n\n\"I'm willing to try it,\" said Tom. \"How about you, Astro?\"\n\n\"I've gone this far, and I'm not quitting now.\"\n\nThey turned to face Roger.\n\n\"Well, how about it, Roger?\" asked Tom. \"No one will think you're yellow\nif you take the jet boat and leave now.\"\n\n\"Ah--talk again!\" grumbled Roger. \"We always have to talk. Let's be\noriginal for a change and just do our jobs!\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Tom. \"Take an emergency light and signal Captain\nStrong. Tell him what we're going to do. Warn him to stay away--about\ntwo hundred miles off. He'll know if we're successful or not within a\nhalf hour!\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Roger, \"then we'll send him one big flash to mean we\nfailed! _Bon voyage!_\"\n\nFifteen minutes later, as the _Lady Venus_ drifted in her silent but\ndeadly orbit, Tom, Roger and Astro still worked feverishly as the Geiger\ncounter ticked off the increasing radioactivity of the wildcatting\nreaction mass in number-three rocket tube.\n\n\"Reading on the counter still's going up, Astro,\" warned Roger.\n\"Fifteen-O-five.\"\n\n\"Hurry it up, Astro,\" urged Tom.\n\n\"Hand me that wrench, Tom,\" ordered Astro. The big cadet, stripped to\nthe waist, his thick arms and chest splattered with grease and sweat,\nfitted the wrench to the nut and applied pressure. Tom and Roger watched\nthe muscles ripple along his back, as the big Venusian pitted all of his\ngreat strength against the metal.\n\n\"Give it all you've got,\" said Tom. \"If we do manage to jettison that\ntube, we've got to keep this part of the power deck airtight!\"\n\nAstro pulled harder. The veins standing out on his neck. At last, easing\noff, he stood up and looked down at the nut.\n\n\"That's as tight as I can get it,\" he said, breathing heavily.\n\n\"Or anyone else,\" said Tom.\n\n\"All the valve connections broken?\" asked Astro.\n\n\"Yep,\" replied Roger. \"We're sealed tight.\"\n\n\"That's it, then,\" said Tom. \"Let's get to the control deck and start\nblasting!\"\n\nAstro turned to the power-deck control board and checked the gauges for\nthe last time. From above his head, he heard Tom's voice over the\nintercom.\n\n\"All your relays to the power deck working, Astro?\"\n\n\"Ready, Tom,\" answered Astro.\n\n\"Then stand by,\" said Tom on the control deck. He had made a hasty check\nof the controls and found them to be similar enough to those on the\n_Polaris_ so that he could handle the ship. He flipped the switch to the\nradar deck and spoke into the intercom.\n\n\"Do we have a clear trajectory fore and aft, Roger?\"\n\n\"All clear,\" replied Roger. \"I sent Captain Strong the message.\"\n\n\"What'd he say?\"\n\n\"The rebellion wasn't anything more than a bunch of badly scared old\nmen. Al James just got hysterical, that's all.\"\n\n[Illustration: _A low muted roar pulsed through the ship_]\n\n\"What did he have to say about this operation?\"\n\n\"I can't repeat it for your young ears,\" said Roger.\n\n\"So bad, huh?\"\n\n\"Yeah, but not because we're trying to save the ship.\"\n\n\"Then why?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"He's afraid of losing a good unit!\"\n\nTom smiled and turned to the control board. \"Energize the cooling\npumps!\" he bawled to Astro over the intercom.\n\nThe slow whine of the pumps began to build to a shrieking pitch.\n\n\"Pumps in operation, Tom,\" said Astro.\n\n\"Cut in nose braking rockets,\" ordered Tom.\n\nA low muted roar pulsed through the ship.\n\n\"Rockets on--we're moving backward, Tom,\" reported Astro.\n\nAnd then suddenly Astro let out a roar. \"Tom, the Geiger counter is\ngoing wild!\"\n\n\"Never mind that now,\" answered Tom. \"Sound off, Roger!\" he yelled.\n\n\"Ship moving astern--one thousand feet a second--two thousand--four\nthousand--\"\n\n\"I'm going to let her build to ten, Roger,\" yelled Tom. \"We've only got\none chance and we might as well make it a good one!\"\n\n\"Six thousand!\" yelled Roger. \"Seven thousand!\"\n\n\"Astro,\" bellowed Tom, \"stand by to fire stern rockets!\"\n\n\"Ready, Tom,\" was Astro's reply.\n\n\"Eight thousand,\" warned Roger. \"Spaceman's luck, fellas!\"\n\nThe silver ship moved through space away from the _Polaris_.\n\n\"Nine thousand,\" reported Roger. \"And, Astro, I really love ya!\"\n\n\"Cut nose braking rockets!\" ordered Tom.\n\nThere was a sudden hush that seemed to be as loud as the noise of the\nrockets. The huge passenger ship, _Lady Venus_, was traveling through\nspace as silent as a ghost.\n\n\"Nine thousand five hundred feet a second,\" yelled Roger.\n\n\"Stand by, Astro, Roger! Hang on tight, and spaceman's luck!\"\n\n\"Ten thousand feet a second!\" Roger's voice was a hoarse scream.\n\n\"_Fire stern rockets!_\" bawled Tom.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 16\n\n\nUnder the tremendous drive of the stern rockets, the silver ship\nsuddenly hurtled forward as if shot out of a cannon. The dangerous tube\nslid out of the stern of the ship and was quickly left behind as the\n_Lady Venus_ sped in the opposite direction.\n\n\"That's it,\" yelled Tom, \"hold full space speed! We dumped the tube, but\nwe're still close enough for it to blow us from here to Pluto!\"\n\n\"I tracked it on the radar, Tom,\" yelled Roger. \"I think we're far\nenough away to miss--\"\n\nAt that moment a tremendous flash of light filled the radar scanner as\nthe mass exploded miles to the rear of the _Lady Venus_.\n\n\"There it goes!\" shouted Roger.\n\n\"Great jumping Jupiter,\" yelled Tom, \"and we're still in one piece! We\ndid it!\"\n\nFrom the power deck, Astro's bull-like roar could be heard through the\nwhole ship.\n\n\"Gimme an open circuit, Tom,\" said Astro. \"I want to operate the air\nblowers down here and try to get rid of some of that radiation. I have\nto get into the control chamber and see what's going on.\"\n\nTom flipped a switch on the board and set the ship on automatic flight.\nThen, turning to the teleceiver, he switched the set on.\n\n\"_Lady Venus_ to _Polaris_--\" said Tom, \"come in, _Polaris_--come in!\"\n\n\" ... Strong here on the _Polaris_!\" the officer's voice crackled over\nthe speaker. \"By the rings of Saturn, I should log you three\nspace-brained idiots for everything in the book!\" Strong's face\ngradually focused on the teleceiver screen and he stared at Tom coldly.\n\"That was the most foolish bit of heroics I've ever seen and if I had my\nway I'd--I'll--well--\" The captain's glare melted into a smile. \"I'll\nspend the rest of my life being known as the skipper of the three\nheroes! Well done, Corbett, it was foolish and dangerous, but well\ndone!\"\n\nTom, his face changing visibly with each change in Strong's attitude,\nfinally broke out into a grin.\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said Tom, \"but Astro and Roger did as much as I did.\"\n\n\"I'm sure they did,\" replied Strong. \"Tell them I think it was one of\nthe--the--\" he thought a moment and then added, \"darndest, most foolish\nthings--most--\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Tom, trying hard to control his face. He knew the\nmoment for disciplining had passed, and that Captain Strong was just\noverwhelmed with concern for their safety.\n\n\"Stand by the air locks, Corbett, we're coming aboard again. We're\npretty cramped for space here on the _Polaris_.\"\n\nJust then Astro yelled up from the power deck.\n\n\"Hey, Tom!\" he called. \"If Captain Strong is thinking about putting\nthose passengers back aboard, I think you'd better tell him about the\nradiation. I haven't been able to flush it all out yet. And since we\nonly have three lead-lined suits....\" He left the statement unfinished.\n\n\"I get you, Astro,\" replied Tom. He turned back to the teleceiver and\nfaced Strong. \"Astro says the ship is still hot from radiation, sir. And\nthat he hasn't been able to flush it out with the blowers.\"\n\n\"Ummmmh,\" mused Strong thoughtfully. \"Well, in that case, stand by,\nCorbett. I'll get in touch with Commander Walters right away.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir,\" replied Tom. He turned from the teleceiver and climbed\nup to the radar deck.\n\n\"Well, hot-shot,\" said Roger, \"looks like you've made yourself a hero\nthis trip.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that, Roger?\"\n\n\"First, you run off with top honors on the space maneuvers, and now you\nsave the ship and have Strong eating out of your hand!\"\n\n\"That's not very funny, Roger,\" said Tom.\n\n\"I think it is,\" drawled Roger.\n\nTom studied the blond cadet for a moment.\n\n\"What's eating you, Roger? Since the day you came into the Academy,\nyou've acted like you hated every minute of it. And yet, on the other\nhand, I've seen you act like it was the most important thing in your\nlife. Why?\"\n\n\"I told you once, Corbett,\" said Roger with the sneering air which Tom\nknew he used when he was on the defensive, \"that I had my own special\nreasons for being here. I'm _not_ a hero, Corbett! Never was and never\nwill be. You're strictly the hero type. Tried and true, a thousand just\nlike you all through the Academy and the Solar Guard. Strong is a hero\ntype!\"\n\n\"Then what about Al James?\" asked Tom. \"What about that time in Atom\nCity when you defended the Academy?\"\n\n\"Uh-uh,\" grunted Roger, \"I wasn't defending the Academy. I was just\navoiding a fight.\" He paused and eyed Tom between half-closed lids.\n\"You'll never do anything I can't, or won't do, just as well, Tom. The\ndifference between us is simple. I'm in the Academy for a reason, a\nspecial reason. You're here, like most of the other cadets, because you\nbelieve in it. That's the difference between you, me and Astro. You\nbelieve in it. I don't--I don't believe in anything but Roger Manning!\"\n\nTom faced him squarely. \"I'm not going to buy that, Roger! I don't think\nthat's true. And the reasons I don't believe it are many. You have a\nchip on your shoulder, yes. But I don't think you're selfish or that you\nonly believe in Manning. If you did, you wouldn't be here on the _Lady\nVenus_. You had your chance to escape back in the rocket tube, but you\n_came back_, Roger, and you made a liar out of yourself!\"\n\n\"Hey, you guys!\" yelled Astro, coming up behind them. \"I thought we left\nthat stuff back at the Academy?\"\n\nTom turned to face the power-deck cadet. \"What's cooking below, Astro?\nWere you able to get rid of the radiation?\"\n\n\"Naw!\" replied the cadet from Venus. \"Too hot! Couldn't even open the\nhatch. It'll take a special job with the big equipment at the space\nshipyards. We need their big blowers and antiradiation flushers to clean\nthis baby up.\"\n\n\"Then I'd better tell Captain Strong right away. He's going to get in\ntouch with Commander Walters at the Academy for orders.\"\n\n\"Yeah, you're right,\" said Astro. \"There isn't a chance of getting those\npeople back aboard here now. Once we opened up that outer control deck\nto dump that tube, the whole joint started buzzing with radioactive\nelectrons.\"\n\nTom turned to the ladder leading to the control deck and disappeared\nthrough the hatch, leaving Astro and Roger alone.\n\n\"What was that little bit of space gas about, Roger?\"\n\n\"Ah--nothing,\" replied Roger. \"Just a little argument on who was the\nbiggest hero.\" Roger smiled and waved a hand in a friendly gesture. \"Tom\nwon, two to one!\"\n\n\"He sure handled that control deck like he had been born here, all\nright,\" said Astro. \"Well, I've got to take a look at those motors.\nWe'll be doing something soon, and whatever it is, we'll need those\npower boxes to get us where we want to go.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Roger, \"and I've got to get a course and a position.\" He\nturned to the chart screen and began plotting rapidly. Down on the\ncontrol deck, Strong was listening to Tom.\n\n\" ... and Astro said we'd need the special equipment at the space\nshipyards to clean out the radiation, sir. If we took passengers aboard\nand it suddenly shot up--well, we only have the three lead-lined suits\nto protect us.\"\n\n\"Very well, Corbett,\" replied Strong. \"I've just received orders from\nCommander Walters to proceed to Mars with both ships. I'll blast off now\nand you three follow along on the _Lady Venus_. Any questions?\"\n\n\"I don't have any, sir,\" Tom said, \"but I'll check with Roger and Astro\nto see if they have any.\"\n\nTom turned to the intercom and informed the radar and power-deck cadets\nof their orders, and asked if there were any questions. Both replied\nthat everything on the ship was ready to blast off immediately. Tom\nturned back to the teleceiver.\n\n\"No questions, sir,\" reported Tom. \"We're all set to blast off.\"\n\n\"Very well, Corbett,\" said Strong. \"I'm going to make as much speed as\npossible to get these people on Mars. The crew of the _Lady Venus_ will\ntake over the radar and power decks.\"\n\n\"O.K., sir, and spaceman's luck!\" said Tom. \"We'll see you on Mars!\"\n\nTom stood beside the crystal port on the control deck and watched the\nrocket cruiser _Polaris_' stern glow red from her jets, and then quickly\ndisappear into the vastness of space, visible only as a white blip on\nthe radar scanner.\n\n\"Get me a course to Mars, Roger,\" said Tom. \"Astro, stand by to blast\noff with as much speed as you can safely get out of this old wagon, and\nstand by for Mars!\"\n\nThe two cadets quickly reported their departments ready, and following\nthe course Roger plotted, Astro soon had the _Lady Venus_ blasting\nthrough space, heading for Mars!\n\nMars, fourth planet in order from the Sun, loomed like a giant red gem\nagainst a perfect backdrop of deep-black space. The _Lady Venus_,\nrocketing through the inky blackness, a dull red glow from her three\nremaining rockets, blasted steadily ahead to the planet that was\ncrisscrossed with wide spacious canals.\n\n\"Last time I was on Mars,\" said Astro to Tom and Roger over a cup of\ntea, \"was about two years ago. I was bucking rockets on an old tub\ncalled the _Space Plunger_. It was on a shuttle run from the Martian\nsouth pole to Venusport, hauling vegetables. What a life! Burning up on\nVenus and then freezing half to death at the south pole on Mars.\" Astro\nshook his head as the vivid memory took him back for a moment.\n\n\"From what I hear,\" said Tom, \"there isn't much to see but the few\ncities, the mountains, the deserts and the canals.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" commented Roger, \"big deal! Rocket into the wild depths of space\nand see the greatest hunk of wasteland in the universe!\"\n\nThe three boys were silent, listening to the steady hum of the rockets,\ndriving them forward toward Mars. For four days they had traveled on the\n_Lady Venus_, enjoying the many luxuries found on the passenger ship.\nNow, with their destination only a few hours away, they were having a\nlight snack before making a touchdown on Mars.\n\n\"You know,\" said Tom quietly, \"I've been thinking. As far back as the\ntwentieth century, Earthmen have wanted to get to Mars. And finally they\ndid. And what have they found? Nothing but a planet full of dry sand, a\nfew canals and dwarf mountains.\"\n\n\"That's exactly what I've been saying!\" said Roger. \"The only man who\never got anything out of all this was the first man to make it to Mars\nand return. He got the name, the glory, and a paragraph in a history\nbook! And after that, nothing!\" He got up and climbed the ladder to the\nradar deck, leaving Astro and Tom alone.\n\nSuddenly the ship lurched to one side.\n\n\"What's that?\" cried Tom.\n\nA bell began to ring. Then another--and then three more. Finally the\nentire ship was vibrating with the clanging of emergency bells.\n\nAstro made a diving leap for the ladder leading down to the power deck,\nwith Tom lunging for the control board.\n\nQuickly Tom glanced about the huge board with its many different gauges\nand dials, searching for the one that would indicate the trouble. His\neye spotted a huge gauge. A small light beside it flashed off and on.\n\"By the moons of Jupiter, we've run out of reactant fuel!\"\n\n\"Tom!--Tom!\" shouted Astro from the power deck. \"We're smack out of\nreactant feed!\"\n\n\"Isn't there any left at all?\" asked Tom. \"Not even enough to get us\ninto Marsopolis?\"\n\n\"We haven't enough left to keep the generator going!\" said Astro.\n\"Everything, including the lights and the teleceiver, will go any\nminute!\"\n\n\"Then we can't change course!\"\n\n\"Right,\" drawled Roger. \"And if we can't change course, the one we're on\nnow will take us straight into Mars's gravity and we crash!\"\n\n\"Send out an emergency call right away, Roger,\" said Tom.\n\n\"Can't, spaceboy,\" replied Roger in his lazy drawl. \"Not enough juice to\ncall for help. Or haven't you noticed you're standing in the dark?\"\n\n\"But how--how could this happen?\" asked Tom, puzzled. \"We were only\ngoing at half speed and using just three rockets!\"\n\n\"When we got rid of that hot tube back in space,\" explained Astro\ngrimly, \"we dumped the main reactant mass. There isn't a thing we can\ndo!\"\n\n\"We've got one choice,\" said Tom hollowly. \"We can either pile out now,\nin space suits and use the jet boat, and hope for someone to pick us up\nbefore the oxygen gives out, or we can ride this space wagon right on\nin. Make up your minds quick, we're already inside Mars's gravity pull!\"\n\nThere was a pause, then Astro's voice filled the control deck. \"I'll\nride this baby right to the bottom. If I'm going to splash in, I'll take\nit on solid ground, even if it is Mars and not Venus. I don't want to\nwash out in space!\"\n\n\"That goes for me, too,\" said Roger.\n\n\"O.K.,\" said Tom. \"Here we go. Just keep your fingers crossed that we\nhit the desert instead of the mountains, or we'll be smeared across\nthose rocks like applesauce. Spaceman's luck, fellas!\"\n\n\"Spaceman's luck, both of you,\" said Astro.\n\n\"Just plain ordinary luck,\" commented Roger, \"and plenty of it!\"\n\nThe three boys quickly strapped themselves into acceleration seats, with\nTom hooking up an emergency relay switch that he could hold in his hand.\nHe hoped he would remain conscious long enough to throw the switch and\nstart the water sprinkler in case the ship caught fire.\n\nThe _Lady Venus_ flashed into the thin atmosphere from the void of space\nand the three cadets imagined that they could hear the shriek of the\nship as it cut through the thin air. Tom figured his speed rapidly, and\ncounting on the thinness of the atmosphere, he estimated that it would\ntake eleven seconds for the ship to crash. He began to count.\n\n\" ... One--two--three--four--five--\" he thought briefly of his family\nand how nice they had been to him \" ... six--seven--eight--nine--ten--\"\n\nThe ship crashed.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 17\n\n\n\"Astro! Roger!\" yelled Tom. He opened his eyes and then felt the weight\non his chest. A section of the control board had fallen across him\npinning his left arm to his side. He reached for the railing around the\nacceleration chair with his right and discovered he still held the\nswitch for the water sprinkler. He started to flip it on, then sniffed\nthe air, and smelling no trace of smoke, dropped the switch. He\nunstrapped himself from the acceleration chair with his right hand and\nthen slowly, with great effort, pushed the section of the control board\noff him. He stood up rubbing his left arm.\n\n\"Astro? Roger?!\" he called again, and scrambled over the broken\nequipment that was strewn over the deck. He stumbled over more rubble\nthat was once a precision instrument panel and climbed the ladder\nleading to the radar deck.\n\n\"Roger!\" he yelled. \"Roger, are you all right?\" He pushed several\nshattered instruments out of the way and looked around the shambles that\nonce had been a room. He didn't see Roger.\n\nHe began to scramble through the litter on the deck, kicking aside\ninstruments that were nearly priceless, so delicately were they made.\nSuddenly a wave of cold fear gripped him and he began tearing through\nthe rubble desperately. From beneath a heavy tube casing, he could see\nthe outstretched arm of Roger.\n\nHe squatted down, bending his legs and keeping his back straight. Then\ngripping the heavy casing on one side, he tried to stand up. It was too\nmuch for him. He lifted it three inches and then had to let go.\n\n\"Tom! Roger!\" Tom heard the bull-like roar of Astro below him and\nstumbled over to the head of the ladder.\n\n\"Up here, Astro,\" he yelled, \"on the radar deck. Roger's pinned under\nthe radar scanner casing!\"\n\nTom turned back to the casing, and looking around the littered deck\ndesperately, grabbed an eight-foot length of steel pipe that had been\nsnapped off like a twig by the force of the crash.\n\nBarely able to lift it, he shoved it with all his strength to get the\nend of the pipe beneath the casing.\n\n\"Here, let me get at that thing,\" growled Astro from behind. Tom stepped\nback, half falling out of the Venusian's way, and watched as Astro got\ndown on his hands and knees, putting his shoulder against the case. He\nlifted it about three inches, then slowly, still balancing the weight on\nhis shoulder, shifted his position, braced it with his hands and began\nto straighten up. The casing came up from the floor as the huge cadet\nstrained against it.\n\n\"All--right--Tom--\" he gasped, \"see if you can get a hold on Roger and\npull him out!\"\n\nTom scrambled back and grabbed Roger's uniform. He pulled, and slowly\nthe cadet's form slid from beneath the casing.\n\n\"All right, Astro,\" said Tom, \"I've got 'im.\"\n\nAstro began to lower the casing in the same manner in which he had\nlifted it. He eased it back down to the floor on his knees and dropped\nit the last few inches. He sat on the floor beside it and hung his head\nbetween his knees.\n\n\"Are you all right, Astro?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"Never mind me,\" panted Astro between deep gasps for breath, \"just see\nif hot-shot is O.K.\"\n\nTom quickly ran his hands up and down Roger's arms and legs, his chest,\ncollarbone and at last, with gently probing fingers, his head.\n\n\"No broken bones,\" he said, still looking at Roger, \"but I don't know\nabout internal injuries.\"\n\n\"He wasn't pinned under that thing,\" said Astro at last. \"It was resting\non a beam. No weight was on him.\"\n\n\"Uh--huh--ahhh--uhhhh,\" moaned Roger.\n\n\"Roger,\" said Tom gently, \"Roger, are you all right?\"\n\n\"Uh--huh?--Ohhhh! My head!\"\n\n\"Take it easy, hot-shot,\" said Astro, \"that head of yours is O.K.\nNothing--but _nothing_ could hurt it!\"\n\n\"Ooohhhh!\" groaned Roger, sitting up. \"I don't know which is worse,\nfeeling the way I do, or waking up and listening to you again!\"\n\nTom sat back with a smile. Roger's remark clinched it. No one was hurt.\n\n\"Well,\" said Astro at last, \"where do we go from here?\"\n\n\"First thing I suggest we do is take a survey and see what's left,\" said\nTom.\n\n\"I came up from the power deck,\" said Astro, \"all the way through the\nship. You see this radar deck?\" He made a sweeping gesture around the\nroom that looked like a junk heap. \"Well, it's in good shape, compared\nto the rest of the ship. The power deck has the rocket motors where the\nmaster panel should be and the panel is ready to go into what's left of\nthe reactant chamber. The jet boat is nothing but a worthless piece of\njunk!\"\n\nThe three boys considered the fate of the jet boat soberly. Finally\nAstro broke the silence with a question. \"Where do you think we are?\"\n\n\"Somewhere in the New Sahara desert,\" answered Tom. \"I had the chart\nprojector on just before we splashed in, but I can't tell you any more\nthan that.\"\n\n\"Well, at least we have plenty of water,\" sighed Roger.\n\n\"You _had_ plenty of water. The tanks were smashed when we came in. Not\neven a puddle left in a corner.\"\n\n\"Of course it might rain,\" said Roger.\n\nTom gave a short laugh. \"The last time it rained in this place dinosaurs\nwere roaming around on Earth!\"\n\n\"How about food?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"Plenty of that,\" answered Astro. \"This is a passenger ship, remember!\nThey have everything you could ask for, including smoked Venusian\nfatfish!\"\n\n\"Then let's get out of here and take a look,\" said Tom.\n\nThe three bruised but otherwise healthy cadets climbed slowly down to\nthe control deck and headed for the galley, where Tom found six plastic\ncontainers of Martian water.\n\n\"Spaceman, this is the biggest hunk of luck we've had in the last two\nhours,\" said Roger, taking one of the containers.\n\n\"Why two hours, Roger?\" asked Astro, puzzled.\n\n\"Two hours ago we were still in space expecting to splash in,\" said Tom.\nHe opened one of the containers and offered it to Astro. \"Take it easy,\nAstro,\" said Tom. \"Unless we find something else to drink, this might\nhave to last a long time.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Roger, \"a _long_ time. I've been thinking about our chances\nof getting out of this mess.\"\n\n\"Well,\" asked Astro, \"what has the great Manning brain figured out?\"\n\n\"There's no chance at all,\" said Roger slowly. \"You're wrong, Corbett,\nabout this being midday. It's early morning!\" He pointed to a\nchronometer on the bulkhead behind Astro. \"It's still running. I made a\nmental note before we splashed in, it was eight-O-seven. That clock\nsays nine-O-three. It doesn't begin to get hot here until three o'clock\nin the afternoon.\"\n\n\"I think you're wrong two ways,\" said Tom. \"In the first place, Captain\nStrong probably has a unit out looking for us right now. And in the\nsecond place, as long as we stay with the ship, we've got shade. That\nsun is only bad because the atmosphere is thinner here on Mars, and\neasier to burn through. But if we stay out of the sun, we're O.K. Just\nsit back and wait for Strong!\"\n\nRoger shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Well,\" commented Astro with a grin, \"I'm not going to sit around\nwaiting for Strong without eating!\" He tore open a plastic package of\nroast-beef sandwiches and began eating. Tom measured out three small\ncups of Martian water.\n\n\"After we eat,\" suggested Roger, \"I think we ought to take a look around\noutside and try to set up an identification signal.\"\n\n\"That's a good idea,\" said Tom, \"but don't you think the ship itself is\nbig enough for that?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" answered Roger, \"I guess you're right.\"\n\n\"Boy!\" said Astro. \"We sure are lucky to still be able to argue.\"\n\n\"That's about all you can call it. Luck! Spaceman's luck!\" said Tom.\n\"The only reason I can figure why we didn't wind up as permanent part of\nthe scenery around here is because of the course we were on.\"\n\n\"How do you figure that?\" asked Astro.\n\n\"Luckily--and I _mean_ luckily, we were on a course that took us smack\nonto the surface of Mars. And our speed was great enough to resist the\ngravity pull of the planet, keeping us horizontal with the surface of\nthe desert. We skidded in like a kid does on a sled, instead of coming\nin on our nose!\"\n\n\"Well, blast my jets!\" said Astro softly.\n\n\"In that case,\" said Roger, \"we must have left a pretty long skid mark\nin back of us!\"\n\n\"That should be easy to see when the jet scouts come looking for us,\"\ncommented Astro.\n\n\"I wonder if we could rig up some sort of emergency signal so we could\nsend out a relative position?\"\n\n\"How are you going to get the position?\" asked Astro.\n\n\"I can give you some sort of position as soon as I get outside and take\na sight on the sun,\" replied Roger.\n\n\"Can you do it without your astrogation prism?\" asked Astro.\n\n\"Navigation, not astrogation, Astro,\" said Roger. \"Like the ancient\nsailors used on the oceans back on Earth hundreds of years ago. Only\nthing is, I'll have to work up the logarithms by hand, instead of using\nthe computer. Might be a little rough, but it'll be close enough for\nwhat we want.\"\n\nThe three cadets finished the remaining sandwiches and then picked their\nway back through the ship to the control deck. There, they rummaged\nthrough the pile of broken and shattered instruments.\n\n\"If we could find just one tube that hasn't been damaged, I think I\nmight be able to rig up some sort of one-lung communications set,\" said\nRoger. \"It might have enough range to get a message to the nearest\natmosphere booster station.\"\n\n\"Nothing but a pile of junk here, Roger,\" said Tom. \"We might find\nsomething on the radar deck.\"\n\nThe three members of the _Polaris_ unit climbed over the rubble and made\ntheir way to the radar deck, and started their search for an undamaged\ntube. After forty-five minutes of searching, Roger stood up in disgust.\n\n\"Nothing!\" he said sourly.\n\n\"That kills any hope of getting a message out,\" said Tom.\n\n\"By the craters of Luna,\" said Astro, wiping his forehead. \"I didn't\nnotice it before, but it's getting hotter here than on the power deck on\na trip to Mercury!\"\n\n\"Do we have any flares?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"Naw. Al James used them all,\" answered Tom.\n\n\"That does it,\" said Roger. \"In another couple of hours, when and if\nanyone shows up, all they'll find is three space cadets fried on the\nhalf shell of a spaceship!\"\n\n\"Listen, Roger,\" said Tom, \"as soon as we fail to check in, the whole\nMars Solar Guard fleet will be out looking for us. Our last report will\nshow them we were heading in this direction. It won't take Captain\nStrong long to figure out that we might have run out of fuel, and, with\nthat skid mark in the sand trailing back for twenty miles, all we have\nto do is stick with the ship and wait for them to show up!\"\n\n\"What's that?\" asked Astro sharply.\n\nFrom a distance, the three cadets could hear a low moaning and wailing.\nThey rushed to the crystal port and looked out on the endless miles of\nbrown sand, stretching as far as the horizon and meeting the cloudless\nblue sky. Shimmering in the heat, the New Sahara desert of Mars was just\nbeginning to warm up for the day under the bleaching sun. The thin\natmosphere offered little protection against the blazing heat rays.\n\n\"Nothing but sand,\" said Tom. \"Maybe something is still hot on the power\ndeck.\" He looked at Astro.\n\n\"I checked it before I came topside,\" said Astro. \"I've heard that noise\nbefore. It can only mean one thing.\"\n\n\"What's that?\" asked Roger.\n\nAstro turned quickly and walked to the opposite side of the littered\ncontrol deck. He pushed a pile of junk out of the way for a clear view\nof the outside.\n\n\"There's your answer,\" said Astro, pointing at the port.\n\n\"By the rings of Saturn, look at that!\" cried Tom.\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Roger, \"black as the fingernails of a Titan miner!\"\n\n\"That's a sandstorm,\" Astro said finally. \"It blows as long as a week\nand can pile up sand for two hundred feet. Sometimes the velocity\nreaches as much as a hundred and sixty miles an hour. Once, in the\nsouth, we got caught in one, and it was so bad we had to blast off. And\nit took all the power we had to do it!\"\n\nThe three cadets stood transfixed as they gazed through the crystal port\nat the oncoming storm. The tremendous black cloud rolled toward the\nspaceship in huge folds that billowed upward and back in\nthree-thousand-foot waves. The roar and wail of the wind grew louder,\nrising in pitch until it was a shrill scream.\n\n\"We'd better get down to the power deck,\" said Tom, \"and take some\noxygen bottles along with us, just in case. Astro, bring the rest of the\nMartian water and you grab several of those containers of food, Roger.\nWe might be holed in for a long time.\"\n\n\"Why go down to the power deck?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"There's a huge hole in the upper part of the ship's hull. That sand\nwill come in here by the ton and there's nothing to stop it,\" Tom\nanswered Roger, but kept his eyes on the churning black cloud. Already,\nthe first gusts of wind were lashing at the stricken _Lady Venus_.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 18\n\n\n\"You think it'll last much longer?\" asked Astro.\n\n\"I don't know, old fellow,\" replied Tom.\n\n\"You know, sometimes you can hear the wind even through the skin of the\nship,\" commented Roger.\n\nFor two days the cadets of the _Polaris_ unit had been held prisoner in\nthe power deck while the violence of the New Sahara sandstorm raged\naround them outside the ship. For a thousand square miles the desert was\na black cloud of churning sand, sweeping across the surface of Mars like\na giant shroud.\n\nAfter many attempts to repair a small generator, Astro finally\nsucceeded, only to discover that he had no means of running the unit.\nHis plan was to relieve the rapidly weakening emergency batteries with a\nmore steady source of power.\n\nWhile Astro occupied himself repairing the generator, Tom and Roger had\nslept, but after the first day, when sleep would no longer come, they\nresorted to playing checkers with washers and nuts on a board scratched\non the deck.\n\n\"Think it's going to let up soon?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"They've been known to last for a week or more,\" said Astro.\n\n\"Wonder if Strong has discovered we're missing?\" mused Roger.\n\n\"Sure he has,\" replied Tom. \"He's a real spaceman. Can smell out trouble\nlike a telemetered alarm system.\"\n\nAstro got up and stretched. \"I'll bet we're out of this five hours after\nthe sand settles down.\"\n\nThe big Venusian walked to the side of the power deck and pressed his\near against the hull, listening for the sound of the wind.\n\nAfter a few seconds he turned back. \"I can't hear a thing, fellas. I\nhave a feeling it's about played itself out.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" reasoned Tom, \"we have no real way of knowing when it's\nstopped and when it hasn't.\"\n\n\"Want to open the hatch and take a look?\" asked Astro.\n\nTom looked questioningly at Roger, who nodded his head in agreement.\n\nTom walked over to the hatch and began undogging the heavy door. As the\nlast of the heavy metal bars were raised, sand began to trickle inside\naround the edges. Astro bent down and sifted a handful through his\nfingers. \"It's so fine, it's like powder,\" he said as it fell to the\ndeck in a fine cloud.\n\n\"Come on,\" said Tom, \"give me a hand with this hatch. It's probably\njammed up against sand on the other side.\"\n\nTom, Roger and Astro braced their shoulders against the door, but when\nthey tried to push, they lost their footing and slipped down. Astro\ndragged over a section of lead baffle, jammed it between the rocket\nmotors and placed his feet up against it. Tom and Roger got on either\nside of him and pressed their shoulders against the door.\n\n\"All right,\" said Tom. \"When I give the word, let's all push together.\nReady?\"\n\n\"All set,\" said Astro.\n\n\"Let's go,\" said Roger.\n\n\"O.K.--then--one--two--three--_push_!\"\n\nTogether, the three cadets strained against the heavy steel hatch. The\nmuscles in Astro's legs bulged into knots as he applied his great weight\nand strength against the door. Roger, his face twisted into a grimace\nfrom the effort, finally slumped to the floor, gasping for breath.\n\n\"Roger,\" asked Tom quickly, \"are you all right?\"\n\nRoger nodded his head but stayed where he was, breathing deeply. Finally\nrecovering his strength, he rose and stood up against the hatch with his\ntwo unit-mates.\n\n\"You and Roger just give a steady pressure, Tom,\" said Astro. \"Don't try\nto push it all at once. Slow and steady does it! That way you get more\nout of your effort.\"\n\n\"O.K.,\" said Tom. Roger nodded. Again they braced themselves against the\nhatch.\n\n\"One--two--three--_push_!\" counted Tom.\n\nSlowly, applying the pressure evenly, they heaved against the steel\nhatch. Tom's head swam dizzily, as the blood raced through his veins.\n\n\"Keep going,\" gasped Astro. \"I think it's giving a little!\"\n\nTom and Roger pushed with the last ounce of strength in their bodies,\nand after a final desperate effort, slumped to the floor breathless.\nAstro continued to push, but a moment later, relaxed and slipped down\nbeside Tom and Roger.\n\nThey sat on the deck for nearly five minutes gasping for air.\n\n\"Like--\" began Roger, \"like father--like son!\" He blurted the words out\nbitterly.\n\n\"Like who?\" asked Astro.\n\n\"Like my father,\" said Roger in a hard voice. He got up and walked\nunsteadily over to the oxygen bottle and kicked it. \"Empty!\" he said\nwith a harsh laugh. \"Empty and we only have one more bottle. Empty as my\nhead the day I got into this space-happy outfit!\"\n\n\"You going to start that again!\" growled Astro. \"I thought you had grown\nout of your childish bellyaching about the Academy.\" Astro eyed the\nblond cadet with a cold eye. \"And now, just because you're in a tough\nspot, you start whining again!\"\n\n\"Knock it off, Astro,\" snapped Tom. \"Come on. Let's give this hatch\nanother try. I think it gave a little on that last push.\"\n\n\"Never-say-die Corbett!\" snarled Roger. \"Let's give it the old try for\ndear old Space Academy!\"\n\nTom whirled around and stood face to face with Manning.\n\n\"I think maybe Astro's right, Roger,\" he said coldly. \"I think you're a\nfoul ball, a space-gassing hot-shot that can't take it when the chips\nare down!\"\n\n\"That's right,\" said Roger coldly. \"I'm just what you say! Go ahead,\npush against that hatch until your insides drop out and see if you can\nopen it!\" He paused and looked directly at Tom. \"If that sand has\npenetrated inside the ship far enough and heavily enough to jam that\nhatch, you can imagine what is on top, outside! A mountain of sand! And\nwe're buried under it with about eight hours of oxygen left!\"\n\nTom and Astro were silent, thinking about the truth in Roger's words.\nRoger walked slowly across the deck and stood in front of them\ndefiantly.\n\n\"You were counting on the ship being spotted by Captain Strong or part\nof a supposed searching party! Ha! What makes you think three cadets are\nso important that the Solar Guard will take time out to look for us? And\nif they _do_ come looking for us, the only thing left up there now\"--he\npointed his finger over his head--\"is a pile of sand like any other sand\ndune on this crummy planet. We're stuck, Corbett, so lay off that last\nchance, do-or-die routine. I've been eating glory all my life. If I do\nhave to splash in now, I want it to be on my own terms. And that's to\njust sit here and wait for it to come. And if they pin the Medal--the\nSolar Medal--on me, I'm going to be up there where all good spacemen go,\nhaving the last laugh, when they put my name alongside my father's!\"\n\n\"Your father's?\" asked Tom bewilderedly.\n\n\"Yeah, my father. Kenneth Rogers Manning, Captain in the Solar Guard.\nGraduate of Space Academy, class of 2329, killed while on duty in space,\nJune 2335. Awarded the Solar Medal _posthumously_. Leaving a widow and\none son, _me_!\"\n\nAstro and Tom looked at each other dumfounded.\n\n\"Surprised, huh?\" Roger's voice grew bitter. \"Maybe that clears up a few\nthings for you. Like why I never missed on an exam. I never missed\nbecause I've lived with Academy textbooks since I was old enough to\nread. Or why I wanted the radar deck instead of the control deck. I\ndidn't want to have to make a decision! My father had to make a decision\nonce. As skipper and pilot of the ship he decided to save a crewman's\nlife. He died saving a bum, a no good space-crawling rat!\"\n\nTom and Astro sat stupefied at Roger's bitter tirade. He turned away\nfrom them and gave a short laugh.\n\n\"I've lived with only one idea in my head since I was big enough to know\nwhy other kids had fathers to play ball with them and I didn't. To get\ninto the Academy, get the training and then get out and cash in! Other\nkids had fathers. All I had was a lousy hunk of gold, worth exactly five\nhundred credits! A Solar Medal. And my mother! Trying to scrape by on a\nlousy pension that was only enough to keep us going, but not enough to\nget me the extra things other kids had. It couldn't bring back my\nfather!\"\n\n\"That night--in Galaxy Hall, when you were crying--?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"So eavesdropping is one of your talents too, eh, Corbett?\" asked Roger\nsarcastically.\n\n\"Now, wait a minute, Roger,\" said Astro, getting up.\n\n\"Stay out of this, Astro!\" snapped Roger. He paused and looked back at\nTom. \"Remember that night on the monorail going into Atom City? That man\nBernard who bought dinner for us? He was a boyhood friend of my\nfather's. He didn't recognize me, and I didn't tell him who I was\nbecause I didn't want you space creeps to know that much about me. And\nremember, when I gave Al James the brush in that restaurant in Atom\nCity? He was talking about the old days, and he might have spilled the\nbeans too. It all adds up, doesn't it? I had a reason I told you and\nit's just this! To make Space Academy pay me back! To train me to be one\nof the best astrogators in the universe so I could go into commercial\nships and pile up credits! Plenty of credits and have a good life, and\nbe sure my mother had a good life--what's left of it. And the whole\nthing goes right back to when my father made the decision to let a space\nrat live, and die in his place! So leave me alone with your last big\nefforts--and grandstand play for glory. From now on, keep your big fat\nmouth shut!\"\n\n\"I--I don't know what to say, Roger,\" began Tom.\n\n\"Don't try to say anything, Tom,\" said Astro. There was a coldness in\nhis voice that made Tom turn around and stare questioningly at the big\nVenusian.\n\n\"You can't answer him because you came from a good home. With a mom and\npop and brother and sister. You had it good. You were lucky, but I don't\nhold it against you because you had a nice life and I didn't.\" Astro\ncontinued softly, \"You can't answer Mr. Hot-shot Manning, but I can!\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"I mean that Manning doesn't know what it is to really have it tough!\"\n\n\"You got a _real_ hard luck story, eh, big boy?\" snarled Roger.\n\n\"Yeah, I have!\" growled Astro. \"I got one that'll make your life look\nlike a spaceman's dream. At least you _know_ about your father. And you\nlived with your mother. I didn't have _anything--nothing_! Did you hear\nthat, Manning? I didn't even have a pair of shoes, until I found a kid\nat the Venusport spaceport one day and figured his shoes would fit me. I\nbeat the space gas out of him and took his shoes. And then they were so\ntight, they hurt my feet. I don't know who my father was, nothing about\nhim, except that he was a spaceman. A rocket buster, like me. And my\nmother? She died when I was born. Since I can remember, I've been on my\nown. When I was twelve, I was hanging around the spaceport day and\nnight. I learned to buck rockets by going aboard when the ships were\ncradled for repairs, running dry runs, going through the motions, I\ntalked to spacemen--all who would listen to me. I lied about my age, and\nbecause I was a big kid, I was blasting off when I was fifteen. What\nlittle education I've got, I picked up listening to the crew talk on\nlong hops and listening to every audioslide I could get my hands on.\nI've had it tough. And because I _have_ had it tough, I want to forget\nabout it. I don't want to be reminded what it's like to be so hungry\nthat I'd go out into jungles and trap small animals and take a chance on\nmeeting a tyrannosaurus. So lay off that stuff about feeling sorry for\nyourself. And about Tom being a hero, because with all your space gas\nyou still can't take it! And if you don't want to fight to live, then go\nlie down in the corner and just keep your big mouth shut!\"\n\nTom stood staring at the big cadet. His head jutted forward from his\nshoulders, the veins in his neck standing out like thick cords. He knew\nAstro had been an orphan, but he had never suspected the big cadet's\nlife had been anything like that which he had just described.\n\nRoger had stood perfectly still while Astro spoke. Now, as the big cadet\nwalked back to the hatch and nervously began to examine the edges with\nhis finger tips, Roger walked over and stood behind him.\n\n\"Well, you knuckle-headed orphan,\" said Roger, \"are you going to get us\nout of here, or not?\"\n\nAstro whirled around, his face grim, his hands balled into fists, ready\nto fight. \"What's that, Mann--?\" He stopped. Roger was smiling and\nholding out his hand.\n\n\"Whether you like it or not, you poor little waif, you've just made\nyourself a friend.\"\n\nTom came up to them and leaned against the door casually. \"When you two\nstop gawking at each other like long-lost brothers,\" he said lazily,\n\"suppose we try to figure a way out of this dungeon.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 19\n\n\n\"Tom--Roger!\" shouted Astro. \"I think I've got it!\"\n\nAstro, on his knees, pulled a long file blade away from the hatch and\njumped to his feet.\n\n\"Did you cut all the way through?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"I don't know--at least I'm not sure,\" Astro replied, looking down at\nthe hole he had made in the hatch. \"But let's give it a try!\"\n\n\"Think we can force it back enough to get a good hold on it?\" asked\nRoger.\n\n\"We'll know in a minute, Roger,\" said Astro. \"Get that steel bar over\nthere and I'll try to slip it in between the hatch and the bulkhead.\"\n\nRoger rummaged around in the jumble of broken parts and tools on the\nopposite side of the power deck and found the steel bar Astro wanted.\nAfter several attempts to force the hatch open had proven futile, Tom\nsuggested that they try to file the hinges off the hatch, and then\nattempt to slide it sideways. After much effort, and working in shifts,\nthey had filed through the three hinges, and now were ready to make a\nlast desperate attempt to escape. Astro took the steel bar from Roger\nand jammed it between the bulkhead wall and the hatch.\n\n\"No telling what we'll find on the other side,\" said Astro. \"If the\nsand has covered up the ship all the way down to here, then we'll never\nget out!\"\n\n\"Couldn't we tunnel through it to the top, if it has filled the ship\ndown as far as here?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"Not through this stuff,\" said Tom. \"It's just like powder.\"\n\n\"Tom's right,\" said Astro. \"As soon as you dig into it, it'll fall right\nback in on you.\" He paused and looked at the hatch thoughtfully. \"No.\nThe only way we can get out of here is if the sand was only blown into\nthe deck outside and hasn't filled the rest of the ship.\"\n\n\"Only one way to find out,\" said Tom.\n\n\"Yeah,\" agreed Roger. \"Let's get that hatch shoved aside and take a\nlook.\"\n\nAstro jammed the heavy steel bar farther into the space between the\nhatch and the bulkhead, and then turned back to his unit-mates.\n\n\"Get that piece of pipe over there,\" he said. \"We'll slip it over the\nend of the bar and that'll give us more leverage.\"\n\nTom and Roger scrambled after the length of pipe, slipped it over the\nend of the bar, and then, holding it at either end, began to apply even\npressure against the hatch.\n\nGradually, a half inch at a time, the heavy steel hatch began to move\nsideways, sliding out and behind the bulkhead. And as the opening grew\nlarger the fine powderlike sand began to fall into the power deck.\n\n\"Let's move it back about a foot and a half,\" said Tom. \"That'll give us\nplenty of room to get through and see what's on the other side.\"\n\nAstro and Roger nodded in agreement.\n\nOnce more the three boys exerted their strength against the pipe and\napplied pressure to the hatch. Slowly, grudgingly it moved back, until\nthere was an eighteen-inch opening, exposing a solid wall of the desert\nsand. Suddenly, as if released by a hidden switch, the sand began to\npour into the power deck.\n\n\"Watch out!\" shouted Tom. The three boys jumped back and looked on in\ndismay as the sand came rushing through the opening. Gradually it slowed\nto a stop and the pile in front of the opening rose as high as the hatch\nitself.\n\n\"That does it,\" said Tom. \"Now we've got to dig through and find out how\ndeep that stuff is. And spacemen, between you and me, I hope it doesn't\nprove too deep!\"\n\n\"I've been thinking, Tom,\" said Roger, \"suppose it's as high as the\nupper decks outside? All we have to do is keep digging it out and\nspreading it around the power deck here until we can get through.\"\n\n\"Only one thing wrong with that idea, Roger,\" said Tom. \"If the whole\nupper part of the ship is flooded with that stuff, we won't have enough\nroom to spread it around.\"\n\n\"We could always open the reaction chamber and fill that,\" suggested\nAstro, indicating the hatch in the floor of the power deck that lead to\nthe reactant chamber.\n\n\"I'd just as soon take my chances with sand,\" said Roger, \"as risk\nopening that hatch. The chamber is still hot from the wildcatting\nreaction mass we had to dump back in space.\"\n\n\"Well, then, let's start digging,\" said Tom. He picked up an empty\ngrease bucket and began filling it with sand.\n\n\"You two get busy loading them, and I'll dump,\" said Astro.\n\n\"O.K.,\" replied Tom and continued digging into the sand with his hands.\n\n\"Here, use this, Tom,\" said Roger, offering an empty Martian water\ncontainer.\n\nSlowly, the three cadets worked their way through the pile on the deck\nin front of the hatch opening and then started on the main pile in the\nopening itself. But as soon as they made a little progress on the main\npile, the sand would fall right in again from the open hatch, and after\ntwo hours of steady work, the sand in front of the hatch still filled\nthe entire opening. Their work had been all for nothing. They sat down\nfor a rest.\n\n\"Let's try it a little higher up, Tom,\" suggested Roger. \"Maybe this\nstuff isn't as deep as we think.\"\n\nTom nodded and stepped up, feeling around the top of the opening. He\nbegan clawing at the sand overhead. The sand still came pouring through\nthe opening.\n\n\"See anything?\" asked Astro.\n\n\"I--don't--know--\" spluttered Tom as the sand slid down burying him to\nhis waist.\n\n\"Better back up, Tom,\" warned Roger. \"Might be a cave-in and you'll get\nburied.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute!\" shouted Tom. \"I think I see something!\"\n\n\"A light?\" asked Astro eagerly.\n\n\"Careful, Tom,\" warned Roger again.\n\nTom clawed at the top of the pile, ignoring the sand that was heaped\naround him.\n\n\"I've got it,\" shouted Tom, struggling back into the power deck just in\ntime to avoid being buried under a sudden avalanche. \"There's another\nhatch up there, just behind the ladder that leads into the passenger\nlounge. That's the side facing the storm! And as soon as we dig a\nlittle, the sand falls from that pile. But the opposite side, leading to\nthe jet-boat deck, is free and clear!\"\n\n\"Then all we have to do is force our way through to the top,\" said\nAstro.\n\n\"That's all,\" said Tom. \"We'd be here until doomsday digging our way\nclear.\"\n\n\"I get it!\" said Roger. \"The storm filled up the side of the ship facing\nthat way, and that is where the passenger lounge is. I remember now. I\nleft the hatch open when we came down here to the power deck, so the\nsand just kept pouring in.\" He smiled sheepishly. \"I guess it's all my\nfault.\"\n\n\"Never mind that now!\" said Tom. \"Take this hose and stick it in your\nmouth, Astro. Breath through your mouth and plug up your nose so you\nwon't get it all stopped up with sand while you pull your way through.\"\n\n\"I'll take this rope with me too,\" said Astro. \"That way I can help pull\nyou guys up after me.\"\n\n\"Good idea,\" said Roger.\n\n\"As soon as you get outside the hatch here,\" said Tom, \"turn back this\nway. Keep your face up against the bulkhead until you get to the top.\nRight above you is the ladder. You can grab it to pull yourself up.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"O.K.,\" said Astro and took the length of hose and put it in his mouth.\nThen, taking a piece of waste cotton, he stopped up his nose and tested\nthe hose.\n\n\"Can you breathe O.K.?\" asked Tom.\n\nAstro signaled that he could and stepped through the hatch. He turned,\nand facing backward, began clawing his way upward.\n\n\"Keep that hose clear, Roger!\" ordered Tom. \"There's about five feet of\nsand that he has to dig through and if any of it gets into the\nhose--well--\"\n\n\"Don't worry, Tom,\" interrupted Roger. \"I've got the end of the hose\nright next to the oxygen bottle. He's getting pure stuff!\"\n\nSoon the big cadet was lost to view. Only the slow movement of the hose\nand rope indicated that Astro was all right. Finally the hose and rope\nstopped moving.\n\nTom and Roger looked at each other, worried.\n\n\"You think something might be wrong?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"I don't know--\" Roger caught himself. \"Say, look--the rope! It's\njerking--Astro's signaling!\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"He made it!\" cried Tom.\n\n\"I wonder if--\" Roger suddenly picked up the end of the hose and spoke\ninto it. \"Astro? Hey, Astro, can you hear me?\"\n\n\"Sure I can.\" Astro's voice came back through the hose. \"Don't shout so\nloud! I'm not on Earth, you know. I'm just ten feet above you!\"\n\nRoger and Tom clapped each other on the shoulders in glee.\n\n\"All set down there?\" called Astro, through the hose.\n\n\"O.K.\" replied Tom.\n\n\"Listen,\" said Astro, \"when you get outside the hatch, you'll find a\npipe running along the bulkhead right over your head. Grab that and pull\nyourself up. Tie the rope around your shoulder, but leave enough of it\nso the next guy can come up. We don't have any way of getting it back\ndown there!\" he warned. \"Who's coming up first?\"\n\nTom looked at Roger.\n\n\"You're stronger, Tom,\" said Roger. \"You go up now and then you can give\nAstro a hand pulling me through.\"\n\n\"All right,\" agreed Tom. He began pulling the hose back through the\nsand. He took the end, cleared it out with a few blasts from the oxygen\nbottle and put it in his mouth. Then, after Roger had helped him tie the\nrope around his shoulders, he stuffed his nose with the waste cotton. He\nstepped to the opening. Roger gave three quick jerks on the rope and\nAstro started hauling in.\n\nWith Astro's help, Tom was soon free and clear, standing beside Astro on\nthe jet-boat deck.\n\n\"Phoooeeeey!\" said Tom, spitting out the sand that had filtered into his\nmouth. \"I never want to do that again!\" He dusted himself off and\nflashed his emergency light around the deck. \"Look at that!\" he said in\namazement. \"If we'd kept on digging, we'd have been trapped down there\nfor--\" he paused and looked at Astro who was grinning--\"a long, long\ntime!\" He held the light on the sand that was flowing out of the open\nhatch of the passenger lounge.\n\n\"Come on,\" urged Astro. \"Let's get Roger out of there!\"\n\nThey called to Roger through the hose and told him to bring two more\nemergency lights and the remainder of the Martian water. Three minutes\nlater the _Polaris_ unit was together again.\n\nStanding on the deck beside his two unit-mates, Roger brushed himself\noff and smiled. \"Well,\" he said, \"looks like we made it!\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Tom, \"but take a look at this!\" He walked across the\njet-boat deck to the nearest window port. What should have been a clear\nview of the desert was a mass of solidly packed sand.\n\n\"Oh, no!\" cried Roger. \"Don't tell me we have to go through that again?\"\n\n\"I don't think it'll be so bad this time,\" said Astro.\n\n\"Why not?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"The sand is banked the heaviest on the port side of the ship. And the\nwindow ports on the starboard side of the control deck were pretty high\noff the ground.\"\n\n\"Well, let's not just stand here and talk about it,\" said Roger. \"Let's\ntake a look!\" He turned and walked through the jet-boat deck.\n\nTom and Astro followed the blond cadet through the darkened passages of\nthe dead ship, and after digging a small pile of sand away from the\ncontrol-deck hatch, found themselves once more amid the jumble of the\nwrecked instruments.\n\nFor the first time in three days, the boys saw sunlight streaking\nthrough the crystal port.\n\n\"I told you,\" cried Astro triumphantly.\n\n\"But there still isn't any way out of this place!\" said Roger. \"We can't\nbreak that port. It's six inches thick!\"\n\n\"Find me a wrench,\" said Astro. \"I can take the whole window port apart\nfrom inside. How do you think they replace these things when they get\ncracked?\"\n\nHurriedly searching through the rubble, Tom finally produced a wrench\nand handed it to Astro. In a half hour Astro had taken the whole section\ndown and had pushed the crystal outward. The air of the desert rushed\ninto the control room in a hot blast.\n\n\"Whew!\" cried Roger. \"It must be at least a hundred and twenty-five\ndegrees out there!\"\n\n\"Come on. Let's take a look,\" said Tom. \"And keep your fingers crossed!\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"That we can dig enough of the sand away from the ship to make it\nrecognizable from the air.\"\n\nFollowing Tom's lead, Roger and Astro climbed through the open port and\nout onto the sand.\n\n\"Well, blast my jets!\" said Astro. \"You can't even tell there was a\nstorm.\"\n\n\"You can't if you don't look at the ship,\" said Tom bitterly. \"That was\nthe only thing around here of any size that would offer resistance to\nthe sand and make it pile up. And, spaceman, look at that pile!\"\n\nAstro and Roger turned to look at the spaceship. Instead of seeing the\nship, they saw a small mountain of sand, well over a hundred feet high.\nThey walked around it and soon discovered that the window port in the\ncontrol deck had been the only possible way out.\n\n\"Call it what you want,\" said Roger, \"but I think it's just plain dumb\nluck that we were able to get out!\" He eyed the mound of sand. Unless\none knew there was a spaceship beneath it, it would have been impossible\nto distinguish it from the rest of the desert.\n\n\"We're not in the clear yet!\" commented Astro grimly. \"It would take a\nhundred men at least a week to clear away enough of that sand so search\nparties could recognize it.\" He glanced toward the horizon. \"There isn't\nanything but sand here, fellows, sand that stretches for a thousand\nmiles in every direction.\"\n\n\"And we've got to walk it,\" said Tom.\n\n\"Either that or sit here and die of thirst,\" said Roger.\n\n\"Any canals around here, Tom?\" asked Astro softly.\n\n\"There better be,\" replied Tom thoughtfully. He turned to Roger. \"If you\ncan estimate our position, Roger, I'll go back inside and see if I can\nfind a chart to plot it on. That way, we might get a direction to start\non at least.\"\n\nAstro glanced up at the pale-blue sky. \"It's going to be a hot day,\" he\nsaid softly, looking out over the flat plain of the desert, \"an awful\nhot day!\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 20\n\n\n\"Got everything we need?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"Everything we'll need--and about all we can safely carry without\nweighing ourselves down too much,\" answered Roger. \"Enough food for a\nweek, the rest of the Martian water, space goggles to protect our eyes\nfrom the sun and emergency lights for each of us.\"\n\n\"Not much to walk a hundred and fifty miles on,\" offered Astro. \"Too bad\nthe sand got in the galley and messed up the rest of that good food.\"\n\n\"We'll have plenty to get us by--if my calculations are right,\" said\nTom. \"One hundred and fifty-four miles to be exact.\"\n\n\"_Exact_ only as far as my sun sight told me,\" said Roger.\n\n\"Do you think it's right?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"I'll answer you this way,\" Roger replied. \"I took that sight six times\nin a half hour and got a mean average on all of them that came out\nwithin a few miles of each other. If I'm wrong, I'm very wrong, but if\nI'm right, we're within three to five miles of the position I gave you.\"\n\n\"That's good enough for me,\" said Astro. \"If we're going out there\"--he\npointed toward the desert--\"instead of sitting around here waiting for\nStrong or someone to show up, then I'd just as soon go now!\"\n\n\"Wait a minute, fellas. Let's get this straight,\" said Tom. \"We're all\nagreed that the odds on Captain Strong's showing up here before our\nwater runs out are too great to risk it, and that we'll try to reach the\nnearest canal. The most important thing in this place is water. If we\nstay and the water we have runs out, we're done for. If we go, we might\nnot reach the canal--and the chance of being spotted in the desert is\neven smaller than if we wait here at the ship.\" He paused. \"So we move\non?\" He looked at the others. Astro nodded and looked at Roger, who\nbobbed his head in agreement.\n\n\"O.K., then,\" said Tom, \"it's settled. We'll move at night when it's\ncool, and try to rest during the day when it's the hottest.\"\n\nRoger looked up at the blazing white sphere in the pale-blue sky that\nburned down relentlessly. \"I figure we have about six hours before she\ndrops for the day,\" he said.\n\n\"Then let's go back inside the ship and get some rest,\" he said.\n\nWithout another word, the three cadets climbed back inside the ship and\nmade places for themselves amid the littered deck of the control room. A\nhot wind blew out of the New Sahara through the open port like a breath\nof fire. Stripped to their shorts, the three boys lay around the deck\nunable to sleep, each thinking quietly about the task ahead, each\nremembering stories of the early pioneers who first reached Mars. In the\nmad rush for the uranium-yielding pitchblende, they had swarmed over the\ndeserts toward the dwarf mountains by the thousands. Greedy, thinking\nonly of the fortunes that could be torn from the rugged little\nmountains, they had come unprepared for the heat of the Martian deserts\nand nine out of ten had never returned.\n\nEach boy thought, too, of the dangers they had just faced. This new\ndanger was different. This was something that couldn't be defeated with\nan idea or a sudden lucky break. This danger was ever present--a fight\nagainst nature, man against the elements on an alien planet. It was a\nbattle of endurance that would wring the last drop of moisture\nmercilessly from the body, until it became a dry, brittle husk.\n\n\"Getting pretty close to sundown,\" said Tom finally. He stood beside the\nopen port and shielded his eyes from the glare of the sun, now slowly\nsinking below the Martian horizon.\n\n\"I guess we'd better get going,\" said Roger. \"All set, Astro?\"\n\n\"Ready, Roger,\" answered the Venusian.\n\nThe three boys dressed and arranged the food packs on their backs. Tom\ncarried the remainder of the Martian water, two quart plastic\ncontainers, and a six-yard square of space cloth, an extremely durable\nflyweight fabric that would serve as protection from the sun during the\nrest stop of the day. Roger and Astro carried the food in compact packs\non their backs. Each boy wore a makeshift hat of space cloth, along with\nspace goggles, a clear sheet of colored plastic that fitted snugly\nacross the face. All three carried emergency lights salvaged from the\nwrecked ship.\n\nTom walked out away from the ship several hundred yards and studied his\npocket compass. He held it steady for a moment, watching the needle\nswing around. He turned and walked slowly still watching the needle of\nthe compass. He waited for it to steady again, then turned back to Roger\nand Astro who stood watching from the window port.\n\n\"This is the way.\" Tom pointed away from the ship. \"Three degrees south\nof east, one hundred and fifty-four miles away, if everything is\ncorrect, should bring us smack on top of a major canal.\"\n\n\"So long, _Lady Venus_,\" said Astro, as he left the ship.\n\n\"Don't think it hasn't been fun,\" added Roger, \"because it hasn't!\"\n\nAstro fell in behind Roger, who in turn followed Tom who walked some ten\nfeet ahead. A light breeze sprang up and blew across the surface of the\npowdery sand. Ten minutes later, when they stopped to adjust their\nshoulder packs, they looked back. The breeze had obliterated their\ntracks and the mountain of sand covering the spaceship appeared to be no\ndifferent from any of the other small dunes on the desert. The New\nSahara desert of Mars had claimed another Earth-ship victim.\n\n\"If we can't see the _Lady Venus_ standing still, and knowing where to\nlook,\" said Astro, \"how could a man in a rocket scout ever find it?\"\n\n\"He wouldn't,\" said Roger flatly. \"And when the water ran out, we'd just\nbe sitting there.\"\n\n\"We're losing time,\" said Tom. \"Let's move.\" He lengthened his stride\nthrough the soft sand that sucked at his high space boots and faced the\nalready dimming horizon. The light breeze felt good on his face.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe three cadets had no fear of running into anything in their march\nthrough the darkness across the shifting sands. And only an occasional\nflash of the emergency light to check the compass was necessary to keep\nthem moving in the right direction.\n\nThere wasn't much talk. There wasn't much to talk about. About nine\no'clock the boys stopped and opened one of the containers of food and\nate a quick meal of sandwiches. This was followed by a carefully\nmeasured ounce of water, and fifteen minutes later they resumed their\nmarch across the New Sahara.\n\nAbout ten o'clock, Deimos, one of the small twin moons of Mars, swung up\noverhead, washing the desert with a pale cold light. By morning, when\nthe cherry-red sun broke the line of the horizon, Tom estimated that\nthey had walked about twenty miles.\n\n\"Think we ought to camp here?\" asked Astro.\n\n\"If you can show me a better spot,\" said Roger with a laugh, \"I'll be\nhappy to use it!\" He swung his arm in a wide circle, indicating a\nwasteland of sand that spread as far as the eyes could see.\n\n\"I could go for another hour or so,\" said Astro, \"before it gets too\nhot.\"\n\n\"And wait for the heat to reach the top of the thermometer? Uh-huh, not\nme,\" said Roger. \"I'll take as much sleep as I can get now--while it's\nstill a little cool.\"\n\n\"Roger's right,\" said Tom. \"We'd better take it easy now. We won't be\nable to get much sleep after noon.\"\n\n\"What do we do from noon until evening?\" asked Astro.\n\n\"Aside from just sitting under this hunk of space cloth, I guess we'll\ncome as close to being roasted alive as a human can get.\"\n\n\"You want to eat now?\" asked Astro.\n\nTom and Roger laughed. \"I'm not hungry, but you go ahead,\" said Tom. \"I\nknow that appetite of yours won't wait.\"\n\n\"I'm not too hungry either,\" said Roger. \"Go ahead, you clobber-headed\njuice jockey.\"\n\nAstro grinned sheepishly, and opening one of the containers of food,\nquickly wolfed down a breakfast of smoked Venusian fatfish.\n\nTom and Roger began spreading the space cloth on the sand that was\nalready hot to the touch. Anchoring the four corners in the sand with\nthe emergency lights and one of Tom's boots, they propped up the center\nwith the food packs, one on top of the other. A crude tent was the\nresult and both boys crawled in under, sprawling on the sand. Astro\nfinished eating, lay down beside his two unit-mates, and in a moment the\nthree cadets were sound asleep.\n\nThe sun climbed steadily over the desert while the _Polaris_ unit slept.\nWith each hour, the heat of the desert rose, climbing past the hundred\nmark, reaching one hundred and twenty, then one hundred and thirty-five\ndegrees.\n\nTom woke up with a start. He felt as if he were inside a blazing\nfurnace. He rolled over and saw Astro and Roger still asleep, sweat\npouring off them in small rivulets. He started to wake them, but decided\nagainst it and just lay still under the thin sheet of space cloth that\nprotected him from the sun. As light as the fabric square was, weighing\nno more than a pound, under the intense heat of the sun it felt like a\nwoolen blanket where it touched him. Astro rolled over and opened his\neyes.\n\n\"What time is it, Tom?\"\n\n\"Must be about noon. How do you feel?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure yet. I had a dream.\" The big cadet rubbed his eyes and\nwiped the sweat from his forehead. \"I dreamed I was being shoved into an\noven--like Hansel and Gretel in that old fairy tale.\"\n\n\"Personally,\" mumbled Roger, without opening his eyes, \"I'll take Hansel\nand Gretel. They might be a little more tender.\"\n\n\"I could do with a drink,\" said Astro, looking at Tom.\n\nTom hesitated. He felt that as hot as it was, it would get still hotter\nand there had to be strict control of the remainder of the water.\n\n\"Try to hold out a little longer, Astro,\" said Tom. \"This heat hasn't\nreally begun yet. You could drink the whole thing and still want more.\"\n\n\"That's right, Astro,\" said Roger, sitting up. \"Best thing to do is just\nwet your tongue and lips a little. Drinking won't do much good now.\"\n\n\"O.K. by me,\" said Astro. \"Well, what do we do now?\"\n\n\"We sit here and we wait,\" answered Tom. He sat up and held the space\ncloth up on his side.\n\n\"You get in the middle, Astro,\" suggested Roger. \"Your head is up higher\nthan mine and Tom's. You can be the tent pole under this big top.\"\n\nAstro grunted and changed places with the smaller cadet.\n\n\"Think there might be a breeze if we opened up one side of this thing?\"\nasked Roger.\n\n\"If there was a breeze,\" answered Tom, \"it'd be so hot, it'd be worse\nthan what we've got inside.\"\n\n\"It sure is going to be a hot day,\" said Astro softly.\n\nThe thin fabric of the space cloth was enough to protect them from the\ndirect rays of the sun, but offered very little protection against the\nheat. Soon the inside of the tent was boiling under the relentless sun.\n\nThey sat far apart, their knees pulled up, heads bowed. Once when the\nheat seemed unbearable, Tom opened one side of the cloth in a desperate\nhope that it might be a little cooler outside. A blast of hot air\nentered the makeshift tent and he quickly closed the opening.\n\nAbout three o'clock Roger suddenly slipped backward and lay sprawled on\nthe sand.\n\nTom opened one of the containers of water and dipped his shirttail into\nit. Astro watched him moisten Roger's lips and wipe his temples. In a\nfew moments the cadet stirred and opened his eyes.\n\n\"I--I--don't know what happened,\" he said slowly. \"Everything started\nswimming and then went black.\"\n\n\"You fainted,\" said Tom simply.\n\n\"What time is it?\" asked Astro.\n\n\"Sun should be dropping soon now, in another couple of hours.\"\n\nThey were silent again. The sun continued its journey across the sky and\nat last began to slip behind the horizon. When the last red rays\nstretched across the sandy desert, the three cadets folded back the\nspace-cloth covering and stood up. A soft evening breeze sprang up,\nrefreshing them a little, and though none of them was hungry, each boy\nate a light meal.\n\nTom opened the container of water again and measured out about an ounce\napiece.\n\n\"Moisten your tongue, and sip it slowly,\" ordered Tom.\n\nRoger and Astro took their share of the water and dipped fingers in it,\nwiping their lips and eyelids. They continued to do this until finally,\nno longer able to resist, they took the precious water and swished it\naround in their mouths before swallowing it.\n\nThey folded the space cloth, shouldered their packs, and after Tom had\nchecked the compass, started their long march toward their plotted\ndestination.\n\nThey had survived their first twenty-four hours in the barren wastes of\nthe New Sahara, with each boy acutely aware that there was at least a\nweek more of the same in front of them. The sky blackened, and soon\nafter Deimos rose and started climbing across the dark sky.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 21\n\n\n\"How much water left?\" asked Astro thickly.\n\n\"Enough for one more drink apiece,\" Tom replied.\n\n\"And then what happens?\" mumbled Roger through his cracked lips.\n\n\"You know what will happen, Roger--you know and I know and Tom knows,\"\nmuttered Astro grimly.\n\nFor eight days they had been struggling across the blistering shifting\nsands, walking by night, sweltering under the thin space cloth during\nthe day. Their tongues were swollen. Scraggly beards covered their chins\nand jaws. Roger's lips were cracked. The back of Tom's neck had suffered\nten minutes of direct sun and turned into a large swollen blister. Only\nAstro appeared to be bearing up under the ordeal. There was no sign of\ntheir being close to the canal.\n\n\"Wanta try marching during the day?\" asked Astro. They had broken camp\non the evening of the eighth day and were preparing to move on into the\nnever-changing desert.\n\n\"If we don't hit the canal sometime during the night, there might be a\nchance it's close enough to reach in a couple of hours,\" replied Tom.\n\"Either that, or we've miscalculated altogether.\"\n\n\"How about you, Roger?\" asked Astro.\n\n\"Whatever you guys decide, I'll be right in back of you.\" Roger had\ngrown steadily weaker during the last three days and found it difficult\nto sleep during the hours of rest.\n\n\"Then we'll keep marching tomorrow,\" said Astro.\n\n\"Let's move out,\" said Tom. Roger and Astro shouldered the remaining\nslender food packs, with Tom carrying the water and space cloth, and\nthey started out into the rapidly darkening desert.\n\nOnce again, as on the previous eight nights, the little moon, Deimos,\nswung across the sky, casting dim shadows ahead of the three marching\nboys. Tom found it necessary to look at the compass more often. He\ncouldn't trust his sense of direction as much as he had earlier. Once,\nhe had gone for two hours in a direction that was fifty degrees off\ncourse. The rest stops also were more frequent now, with each boy\nthrowing his pack to the ground and lying flat on his back, to enjoy the\ncool breeze that never failed to soothe their scorched faces.\n\nWhen the sun rose out of the desert on the morning of the ninth day,\nthey stopped, ate a light breakfast of preserved figs, divided the juice\nevenly among them, and, ripping the space cloth into three sections,\nwrapped it around themselves like Arabs and continued to walk.\n\nBy noon, with the sun directly overhead, they were staggering. At\ntwo-thirty the sun and the heat were so overpowering that they stopped\ninvoluntarily and tried to sit on the hot sand only to find that they\ncouldn't and so they stumbled on.\n\nNeither Roger nor Astro asked for water. Finally Tom stopped and faced\nhis two unit-mates wobbling on unsteady legs.\n\n\"I've gone as far as I can without water. I--I don't think I can go\nanother step. So come on, we'll finish what we've got.\"\n\nAstro and Roger nodded in quiet agreement. They watched with dull eyes\nas Tom carefully opened the plastic container of water. He gave each a\ncup and slowly, cautiously, measured out the remaining water into three\nequal parts. He held the container up for a full minute allowing the\nlast drop to run out before tossing the empty bottle to one side.\n\n\"Here goes,\" said Tom. He wet his lips, placed a wet finger on his\ntemples and sipped the liquid slowly, allowing it to trickle down his\nparched throat.\n\nRoger and Astro did the same. After he had wet his lips, Astro took the\nfull amount in his mouth and washed it around, before swallowing it.\nRoger brought the cup up slowly to his mouth with trembling hands,\ntipped it shakily, and then before Astro or Tom could catch him, fell to\nthe ground. The precious water spilled into the sand.\n\nTom and Astro watched dumfounded as the dry sand sucked away the water\nuntil nothing remained but a damp spot six inches wide.\n\n\"I guess--\" began Tom, \"I guess that about does it!\"\n\n\"We'll have to carry him,\" said Astro simply.\n\nTom looked up into the eyes of his unit-mate. There he saw a\ndetermination that would not be defeated. He nodded his head and stooped\nover to grapple with Roger's legs. He got one leg under each arm and\nthen tried to straighten up. He fell to the sand and rolled to one side.\nAstro watched him get up slowly, wearily, his space-cloth covering\nremaining on the ground, and then, with gritted teeth, try once more to\npick Roger's legs up.\n\nAstro put out his hand and touched Tom on the shoulder. His voice was\nlow, hardly above a whisper. \"You lead the way, Tom. I'll carry him.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"_You lead the way, Tom. I'll carry him._\"]\n\nTom looked up at the big Venusian. Their eyes locked for a moment and\nthen he nodded his head and turned away. He pulled out the pocket\ncompass and through blurred vision read the course beneath its wavering\nneedle. He waved an arm in a direction to the right of them and\nstaggered off.\n\nAstro stooped down, picked Roger up in his arms and slowly got him\nacross his shoulders. Then steadying himself, he walked after Tom.\n\nSuddenly a blast of wind, hot as fire, swept across the sandy plains,\nwhipping the sand up and around the two walking figures, biting into\nexposed hands and faces. Tom tried to adjust his goggles when the sand\nbegan to penetrate around the edges but his fingers shook and he dropped\nthem. In a flash, the sand drove into his eyes, blinding him.\n\n\"I can't see, Astro,\" said Tom in a hoarse whisper when Astro staggered\nup. \"You'll have to guide.\"\n\nAstro took the compass out of Tom's hand and then placed his unit-mate's\nhand on his back. Tom gripped the loose folds of the space cloth and\nuniform beneath and struggled blindly after the big cadet.\n\nThe hot sun bore down. The wind kept blowing and Astro, with Roger slung\nacross his back like a sack of potatoes and Tom clinging blindly to his\nuniform, walked steadily on.\n\nHe felt each step would be his last, but with each step he told himself\nthrough gritted teeth that he could do ten more--and then ten more--ten\nmore.\n\nHe walked, he staggered, and once he fell to the ground, Tom slumping\nbehind him and Roger being tossed limply to the scorching sand. Slowly\nAstro recovered, helped Tom to his feet, then with the last of his great\nstrength, picked up Roger again. This time, he was unable to get him to\nhis shoulder so he carried him like a baby in his arms.\n\nAt last the sun began to drop in the red sky. Astro felt Roger's limp\nbody slipping from his grip. By now, Tom had lost all but the very last\nounce of his strength and was simply being pulled along.\n\n\"Tom--\" gasped Astro with great effort, \"I'm going to count to a\nthousand and then--I'm going to stop.\"\n\nTom didn't answer.\n\nAstro began to count. \"One--two--three--four--five--six--\" He tried to\nmake each number become a step forward. He closed his eyes. It wasn't\nimportant which way he went. It was only important that he walk those\nthousand steps, \"five hundred eleven--five hundred twelve--five hundred\nthirteen--\"\n\nInvoluntarily he opened his eyes when he felt himself climbing up a\nsmall rise in the sand. He opened his eyes and ten feet away was the\nflat blue surface of the canal they had been searching for.\n\n\"You can let go now, Tom,\" said Astro in a voice hardly above a whisper.\n\"We made it. We're on the bank of the canal.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Hey, Roger,\" yelled Astro from the middle of the canal, \"ever see a guy\nmake like a submarine?\"\n\nTom and Roger sat on the top of the low bank of the canal drying off\nfrom a swim, while Astro still splashed around luxuriating in the cool\nwater.\n\n\"Go on,\" yelled Roger, \"let's see you drown yourself!\"\n\n\"Not me, hot-shot,\" yelled Astro. \"After that walk, all I'd have to do\nis open my mouth and start drinking.\"\n\nFinally tiring of his sport, the big Venusian pulled himself up onto the\nbank of the canal and quickly dressed. Pulling on his space boots, he\nturned to Tom and Roger, who were breaking out the last two containers\nof food.\n\n\"You know, Astro,\" said Roger quietly, \"I'll never be able to repay you\nfor carrying me.\"\n\nTom was quiet for a moment, and then added, \"Same here, Astro.\"\n\nAstro grinned from ear to ear. \"Answer me this one question, both of\nyou. Would you have done it for me?\"\n\nThe two boys nodded.\n\n\"Then you paid me. As long as I know I'm backed up by two guys like you,\nthen I'm paid. Carrying you, Roger, was just something I could do for\nyou at that particular time. One of these days, when we get out of this\noven, there'll come a time when you or Tom will do something for me--and\nthat's the way it should be.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Astro,\" said Roger. He reached over and put his hand on top of\nAstro's, and then Tom placed his hand on top of theirs. The three boys\nwere quiet for a moment. There was an understanding in each of them that\nthey had accomplished more than just survival in a desert. They had\nlearned to respect each other. They were a unit at last.\n\n\"What do we do next?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"Start walking that way,\" said Tom, pointing to his left along the bank\nof the canal that stretched off in a straight line to the very horizon.\n\"If we're lucky, we might be able to find something to use as a raft and\nthen we can ride.\"\n\n\"Think there are any fish in this canal?\" asked Astro, gazing out over\nthe cool blue water.\n\n\"Doubt it. At least I've never heard of there being any,\" replied Tom.\n\n\"Well,\" said Roger, standing up, \"you can go a lot farther without food\nthan you can without water. And we still have that big container of ham\nleft.\"\n\n\"Yeah, as soon as it gets hot, we just swim instead of walk,\" said\nAstro. \"And, believe me, there's going to be a lot of swimming done!\"\n\n\"Think we might strike anything down that way,\" asked Roger. He looked\ndown the canal in the direction Tom had indicated.\n\n\"That's the direction of the nearest atmosphere booster station. At\nleast that was the way it looked on the chart. All of them were built\nnear the canals.\"\n\n\"How far away do you think it is?\" asked Astro.\n\n\"Must be at least three hundred miles.\"\n\n\"Let's start moving,\" said Roger, \"and hope we can find something\nthat'll float us on the canal.\"\n\nSingle file, wearing the space cloths once more as protection against\nthe sun, they walked along the bank of the canal. When the heat became\nunbearable, they dipped the squares of space cloths into the water and\nwrapped themselves in them. When they began to dry out, they would\nrepeat the process. At noon, when the sun dried the fabric nearly as\nfast as they could wet it, they stopped and slipped over the edge of the\nbank into the cool water. Covering their heads with the cloths they\nremained partly submerged until the late afternoon. When the sun had\nlost some of its power, again they climbed out and continued walking.\n\nMarching late into the night, they made camp beside the canal, finished\nthe last container of food, and, for the first time since leaving the\nship, slept during the night. By the time Deimos had risen in the sky,\nthey were sound asleep.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 22\n\n\n\"Eeeeeeoooooooow!\" Astro's bull-like roar shattered the silence of the\ndesert. \"There--up ahead, Tom--Roger--a building!\"\n\nTom and Roger stopped and strained their eyes in the bright sunshine.\n\n\"I think you're right,\" said Tom at last. \"But I doubt if anyone's\nthere. Looks like an abandoned mining shack to me.\"\n\n\"Who wants to stand here and debate the question?\" asked Roger, and\nstarted off down the side of the canal at a lope, with Astro and Tom\nright behind him.\n\nDuring the last three days the boys had been living off the contents of\nthe last remaining food container and the few lichens they found growing\nalong the canal. Their strength was weakening, but with an abundant\nsupply of water near at hand and able to combat the sun's heat with\nfrequent swims, they were still in fair condition.\n\nTom was the first to reach the building, a one-story structure made of\ndried mud from the canal. The shutters and the door had long since been\ntorn away by countless sandstorms.\n\nThe three boys entered the one-room building cautiously. The floor was\ncovered with sand, and sand was piled in heaping drifts in front of the\nopen windows and door.\n\n\"Nothing--not a thing,\" said Roger disgustedly. \"This place must be at\nleast a hundred and fifty years old.\"\n\n\"Probably built by a miner,\" commented Tom.\n\n\"What do you mean 'nothing'?\" said Astro. \"Look!\"\n\nThey followed Astro's pointing finger to the ceiling. Crisscrossed, from\nwall to wall, were heavy wooden beams.\n\n\"Raft!\" Tom cried.\n\n\"That's right, spaceman,\" said Astro, \"a raft. There's enough wood up\nthere to float the _Polaris_. Come on!\"\n\nAstro hurried outside, with Tom and Roger following at his heels. They\nquickly climbed to the roof of the old building and soon were ripping\nthe beams from the crumbling mud. Fortunately the beams had been joined\nby notching the ends of the crosspieces. Astro explained that this was\nnecessary because of the premium on nails when the house was built.\nEverything at that time had to be hauled from Earth, and no one wanted\nto pay the price heavy nails and bolts demanded.\n\nOne by one, they removed the heavy beams, until they had eight of them\nlined up alongside the edge of the canal.\n\n\"How do we keep them together?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"With this!\" said Tom. He began ripping his space cloth into long\nstrips. Astro and Roger tugged at the first beam. At last they had it in\nthe water.\n\n\"It floats,\" cried Astro. Tom and Roger couldn't help but shout for joy.\nThey quickly hauled the remaining beams into the water and lashed them\ntogether. Without hesitation, they shoved the raft into the canal,\nclimbing aboard and standing like conquering heroes, as the raft moved\nout into the main flow of the canal and began to drift forward.\n\n\"I dub thee--_Polaris the Second_,\" said Tom in formal tones and gave\nthe nearest beam a kick.\n\nAstro and Roger gave a lusty cheer.\n\nSteadily, silently, the raft bore them through the never-changing scene\nof the canal's muddy banks and the endlessness of the desert beyond.\n\nProtecting themselves from the sun during the day by repeated dunkings\nin the water, they traveled day and night in a straight course down the\ncenter of the canal. At night, the tiny moon, Deimos, climbed across the\ndesert and reflected light upon the satin-smooth water.\n\nThe third day on the raft they began to feel the pangs of hunger. And\nwhere during their march through the desert, their thoughts were of\nwater, now visions of endless tables of food occupied their thoughts. At\nfirst, they talked of their hunger, dreaming up wild combinations of\ndishes and giving even wilder estimates of how much each could consume.\nFinally, discovering that talking about it only intensified their\ndesire, they kept a stolid silence. When the heat became unbearable,\nthey simply took to the water. Once Tom's grip on the raft slipped and\nRoger plunged in after him without a moment's hesitation, only to have\nAstro go in to save both of them.\n\nOn and on--down the canal, the three boys floated. Days turned into\nnights, and nights, cooling and refreshing, gave way to the blazing sun\nof the next day. The silent desert swept past them.\n\nOne night, when Astro, unable to sleep, was staring ahead into the\ndarkness, he heard a rustling in the water alongside the raft. He moved\nslowly to the edge of the raft and peered down into the clear water.\n\nHe saw a fish!\n\nThe big cadet watched it dart around the raft. He waited, his body\ntense. Once the fish came to the edge of the raft, but before Astro\ncould move his arm, it darted off in another direction.\n\nAt last the fish disappeared and Astro sank back on the timbers. He\ntrailed one hand over the side in the water, and suddenly, felt the\nrough scales of the fish brush his fingers. In a flash, Astro closed his\nhand and snatched the wriggling creature out of the water.\n\n\"Tom--Roger--\" he shouted. \"Look--look--a fish--I caught a fish with my\nbare hands!\"\n\nTom rolled over and opened his eyes. Roger sat in bewilderment.\n\n\"I watched him--I was watching him and then he went away. And then I\nheld my hand over the side of the raft and he came snooping around\nand--well, I just grabbed him!\"\n\nHe held the fish in the viselike grip of his right hand until it stopped\nmoving.\n\n\"You know,\" said Tom weakly, \"I just remembered. When we were in the\nScience Building in Atom City, one of their projects was to breed both\nEarth and Venus fish in the canals.\"\n\n\"I am going to shake, personally, the hand of the man who started this\nproject when we get back to Atom City,\" said Astro.\n\nSuddenly Roger gripped Tom's arms. He was staring in the direction the\nraft was going. \"Tom--\" he breathed, \"Astro--look!\"\n\nThey turned and peered into the dusk. In the distance, not a mile away,\nwas the huge crystal-clear dome of the atmosphere booster station, its\nroaring atomic motors sending a steady purring sound out across the\ndesert.\n\n\"We made it,\" said Tom, choking back the tears. \"We made it!\"\n\n\"Well, blast my jets,\" said Astro. \"We sure did!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"And you mean to tell me, you _walked_ across that desert?\" asked\nCaptain Strong.\n\nTom glanced over at Astro and Roger. \"We sure did, sir.\"\n\n\"With Astro doing the last stretch to the canal carrying me and dragging\nTom,\" said Roger as he sipped his hot broth.\n\nThe room in the chief engineer's quarters at the atmosphere station was\ncrowded with workers, enlisted Solar Guardsmen and officers of the Solar\nGuard. They stood around staring in disbelief at the three disheveled\ncadets.\n\n\"But how did you ever survive?\" asked Strong. \"By the craters of Luna,\nthat blasted desert was hotter this past month than it has ever been\nsince Mars was first colonized by Earthmen. Why--why--you were walking\nthrough temperatures that reached a hundred and fifty degrees!\"\n\n\"You don't have to convince us, sir,\" said Roger with a smile. \"We'll\nnever forget it as long as we live.\"\n\nLater, when Tom, Roger and Astro had taken a shower and dressed in fresh\nuniforms, Strong came in with an audioscriber and the three cadets gave\nthe full version of their adventure for the official report back to the\nAcademy. When they had finished, Strong told them of his efforts to find\nthem.\n\n\"We knew you were in trouble right away,\" said Strong, \"and we tracked\nyou on radar. But that blasted storm fouled us all up. We figured that\nthe sand would have covered up the ship, and that the chances of finding\nyou in a scout were very small, so I got permission from Commander\nWalters to organize this ground search for you.\" He paused. \"Frankly we\nhad just about given up hope. Took us three weeks finally to locate the\nsection of desert you landed in.\"\n\n\"We knew you would come, sir,\" said Tom, \"but we didn't have enough\nwater to wait for you--and we had to leave.\"\n\n\"Boys,\" said Strong slowly, \"I've had a lot of wonderful things happen\nto me in the Solar Guard. But I have to confess that seeing you three\nspace-brained idiots clinging to that raft, ready to eat a raw\nfish--well, that was just about the happiest moment of my life.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said Roger, \"and I think I can speak for Tom and Astro\nwhen I say that seeing you here with over a hundred men, and all this\nequipment, ready to start searching for us in that desert--well, it\nmakes us feel pretty proud to be members of an outfit where the skipper\nfeels that way about his crew!\"\n\n\"What happens now, sir?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"Aside from getting a well-deserved liberty, it's back to the old grind\nat the Academy. The _Polaris_ is at the spaceport at Marsopolis, waiting\nfor us.\" He paused and eyed the three cadets with a smile. \"I guess the\nroutine at Space Academy will seem a little dull now, after what you've\nbeen through.\"\n\n\"Captain Strong,\" said Astro formally, \"I _know_ I speak for Tom and\nRoger when I say that _routine_ is all we want for a long time to come!\"\n\n\"Amen!\" added Tom and Roger in unison.\n\n\"Very well,\" said Strong. \"_Polaris_ unit--Staaaaand _TO_!\"\n\nThe three boys snapped to attention.\n\n\"You are hereby ordered to report aboard the _Polaris_ at fifteen\nhundred hours and stand by to raise ship!\"\n\nHe returned their salutes, turned sharply and walked from the room.\n\nOutside, Steve Strong leaned against the wall and stared through the\ncrystal shell of the atmosphere station into the endless desert.\n\n\"Thank you, Mars,\" he said softly, \"for making spacemen out of the\n_Polaris_ crew!\" He saluted sharply and walked away.\n\nTom suddenly burst from the room with Roger and Astro yelling after him.\n\n\"Hey, Tom, where you going?\" yelled Roger.\n\n\"I've got to get a bottle of that water out of the canal for my kid\nbrother Billy!\" shouted Tom and disappeared down a slidestairs.\n\nRoger turned to Astro and said, \"That's what I call a real spaceman.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Astro.\n\n\"After what we've been through, he still remembers that his kid brother\nwants a bottle of water from a canal as a souvenir!\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" breathed Astro, \"Tom Corbett is--is--a real spaceman!\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Stand by for Mars!, by Carey Rockwell\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK STAND BY FOR MARS! ***\n\n***** This file should be named 19526.txt or 19526.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/9/5/2/19526/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Ross Wilburn and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
