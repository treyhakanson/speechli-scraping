It\nkeeps me awake at night thinking of all those bodies I have sent to\nthe vaults, and it interferes to a marked extent with my digestion. I\nthought before Councilman Coleman came to see me that there wasn't much\nthat could bother me worse.\n\nColeman came in the morning before I was really ready to face the\nday. My nerves were fairly well shot from the kind of work I did as\nsuperintendent of Dreamland. I chewed up my pill to calm me down,\nthe one to pep me up, the capsule to strengthen my qualities as a\nrelentless perfectionist. I washed them down with gin and orange\njuice and sat back, building up my fortitude to do business over the\npolished deck of my desk.\n\nBut instead of the usual morning run of hysterical relatives and\nmasochistic mystics, I had to face one of my superiors from the\nCommittee itself.\n\nCouncilman Coleman was an impressive figure in a tailored black tunic.\nHis olive features were set off by bristling black eyes and a mobile\nmustache. He probably scared most people, but not me. Authority doesn't\nfrighten me any more. I've put to sleep too many megalomaniacs,\ndictators, and civil servants.\n\n\"Warden Walker, I've been following your career with considerable\ninterest,\" Coleman said.\n\n\"My career hasn't been very long, sir,\" I said modestly. I didn't\nmention that _nobody_ could last that long in my job. At least, none\nhad yet.\n\n\"I've followed it from the first. I know every step you've made.\"\n\nI didn't know whether to be flattered or apprehensive. \"That's fine,\" I\nsaid. It didn't sound right.\n\n\"Tell me,\" Coleman said, crossing his legs, \"what do you think of\nDreamland in principle?\"\n\n\"Why, it's the logical step forward in penal servitude. Man has been\nheading toward this since he first started civilizing himself. After\nall, some criminals _can't_ be helped psychiatrically. We can't execute\nthem or turn them free; we have to imprison them.\"\n\nI waited for Coleman's reaction. He merely nodded.\n\n\"Of course, it's barbaric to think of a prison as a place of\npunishment,\" I continued. \"A prison is a place to keep a criminal away\nfrom society for a specific time so he can't harm that society for that\ntime. Punishment, rehabilitation, all of it is secondary to that. The\npurpose of confinement is confinement.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe councilman edged forward an inch. \"And you really think Dreamland\nis the most humane confinement possible?\"\n\n\"Well,\" I hedged, \"it's the most humane we've found yet. I suppose\nliving through a--uh--movie with full sensory participation for year\nafter year can get boring.\"\n\n\"I should think so,\" Coleman said emphatically. \"Warden, don't you\nsometimes feel the old system where the prisoners had the diversions\nof riots, solitary confinement, television, and jailbreaks may have\nmade time easier to serve? Do these men ever think they are _actually_\nliving these vicarious adventures?\"\n\nThat was a question that made all of us in the Dreamland service\nuneasy. \"No, Councilman, they don't. They know they aren't really\nAlexander of Macedonia, Tarzan, Casanova, or Buffalo Bill. They are\nconscious of all the time that is being spent out of their real lives;\nthey know they have relatives and friends outside the dream. They know,\nunless--\"\n\nColeman lifted a dark eyebrow above a black iris. \"Unless?\"\n\nI cleared my throat. \"Unless they go mad and really believe the dream\nthey are living. But as you know, sir, the rate of madness among\nDreamland inmates is only slightly above the norm for the population as\na whole.\"\n\n\"How do prisoners like that adjust to reality?\"\n\nWas he deliberately trying to ask tough questions? \"They don't. They\nthink they are having some kind of delusion. Many of them become\nschizoid and pretend to go along with reality while secretly 'knowing'\nit to be a lie.\"\n\nColeman removed a pocket secretary and broke it open. \"About these new\nfree-choice models--do you think they genuinely are an improvement over\nthe old fixed-image machines?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" I replied. \"By letting the prisoner project his own\nimagination onto the sense tapes and giving him a limited amount of\nalternatives to a situation, we can observe whether he is conforming to\nsociety to a larger extent.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you said that, Walker,\" Councilman Coleman told me warmly.\n\"As I said, I've been following your career closely, and if you\nget through the next twenty-four-hour period as you have through\nthe foregoing part of your Dream, you will be awakened at this time\ntomorrow. Congratulations!\"\n\nI sat there and took it.\n\nHe was telling _me_, the superintendent of Dreamland, that my own\nlife here was only a Dream such as I fed to my own prisoners. It was\nunbelievably absurd, a queasy little joke of some kind. But I didn't\ndeny it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIf it _were_ true, if I had forgotten that everything that happened was\nonly a Dream, and if I admitted it, the councilman would know I was\nmad. _It couldn't be true._ Yet--\n\nHadn't I thought about it ever since I had been appointed warden and\ntransferred from my personnel job at the plant?\n\nWhenever I had come upon two people talking, and it seemed as if I had\ncome upon those same two people talking the same talk before, hadn't I\nwondered for an instant if it couldn't be a Dream, not reality at all?\n\nOnce I had experienced a Dream for five or ten minutes. I was driving\na ground car down a spidery road made into a dismal tunnel by weeping\ntrees, a dank, lavender maze. I had known at the time it was a Dream,\nbut still, as the moments passed, I became more intent on the\ndifficult road before me, my blocky hands on the steering wheel, thick\nfingers typing out the pattern of motion on the drive buttons.\n\nI could remember that. Maybe I couldn't remember being shoved into the\nprison vault for so many years for such and such a crime.\n\nI didn't really believe this, not then, but I couldn't afford to make\na mistake, even if it were only some sort of intemperate test--as I\nwas confident it was, with a sweet, throbbing fury against the man who\nwould employ such a jagged broadsword for prying in his bureaucratic\nmajesty.\n\n\"I've always thought,\" I said, \"that it would be a good idea to show\na prisoner what the modern penal system was all about by giving him a\nDream in which he dreamed about Dreamland itself.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" Coleman concurred. Just that and no more.\n\nI leaned intimately across my beautiful oak desk. \"I've thought that\nprojecting officials into the Dream and letting them talk with the\nprisoners might be a more effective form of investigation than mere\nobservation.\"\n\n\"I should say so,\" Coleman remarked, and got up.\n\nI _had_ to get more out of him, some proof, some clue beyond the\npreposterous announcement he had made.\n\n\"I'll see you tomorrow at this time then, Walker.\" The councilman\nnodded curtly and turned to leave my office.\n\nI held onto the sides of my desk to keep from diving over and teaching\nhim to change his concept of humor.\n\nThe day was starting. If I got through it, giving a good show, I would\nbe released from my Dream, he had said smugly.\n\nBut if this was a dream, did I want probation to reality?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHorbit was a twitchy little man whose business tunic was the same\nrodent color as his hair. He had a pronounced tic in his left cheek. \"I\nhave to get back,\" he told me with compelling earnestness.\n\n\"Mr. Horbit--Eddie--\" I said, glancing at his file projected on my desk\npad, \"I can't put you back into a Dream. You served your full time for\nyour crime. The maximum.\"\n\n\"But I haven't adjusted to society!\"\n\n\"Eddie, I can shorten sentences, but I can't expand them beyond the\nlimit set by the courts.\"\n\nA tear of frustration spilled out of his left eye with the next twitch.\n\"But Warden, sir, my psychiatrist said that I was unable to cope with\nreality. Come on now, Warden, you don't want a guy who can't cope with\nreality running around loose.\" He paused, puzzled. \"Hell, I don't\nknow why I can't express myself like I used to.\"\n\nHe could express himself much better in his Dream. He had been Abraham\nLincoln in his Dream, I saw. He had lived the life right up to the\nnight when he was taking in _An American Cousin_ at the Ford Theater.\nHorbit couldn't accept history that he had no more life to live. He\nonly knew that if in his delirium he could gain Dreamland once more, he\ncould get back to the hard realities of dealing with the problems of\nReconstruction.\n\n\"_Please_,\" he begged.\n\nI looked up from the file. \"I'm sorry, Eddie.\"\n\nHis eyes narrowed, both of them, on the next twitch. \"Warden, I can\nalways go out and commit another anti-social act.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid not, Eddie. The file shows you are capable of only one\ncrime. And you don't have a wife any more, and she doesn't have a\nlover.\"\n\nHorbit laughed. \"Your files aren't infallible, Warden.\"\n\nWith one gesture, he ripped open his tunic and tore into his own flesh.\nNo, not his own flesh. Pseudo-flesh. He took out the gun that was\nunderneath.\n\n\"The beamer is made of X-ray-transparent plastic, Warden, but it works\nas well as one made of steel and lead.\"\n\n\"Now that you've got it in here,\" I said in time with the pulse in my\nthroat, \"what are you going to do with it?\"\n\n\"I'm going to make you go down to the vaults and put me back to sleep,\nWarden.\"\n\nI nodded. \"I suppose you can do that. But what's to prevent me from\nwaking you up as soon as I've taken away your gun?\"\n\n\"This!\" He tossed a sheet of paper onto my desk.\n\n\"What's this?\" I asked unnecessarily. I could read it.\n\n\"A confession that you accepted a bribe to put me back to sleep,\"\nHorbit said, his tic beating out a feverish tempo. \"As soon as you've\nsigned it, I'll use your phone to have it telefaxed to the Registrar of\nPrivate Documents.\"\n\nI had to admire the thought behind the idea. Horbit was convinced that\nI was only a figment of his unfocused imagination, but he was playing\nthe game with uncompromising logic, trusting that even madness had hard\nand tight rules behind it.\n\nThere was also something else I admired about the plan.\n\nIt could work.\n\nOnce he fed that document to the archives, I would be obligated to help\nhim even without the gun. My word would probably be taken that I had\nbeen forced to do it at gunpoint, but there would always be doubts,\nenough to wreck my career when it came time for promotion.\n\nNothing like this had ever happened in my years as warden.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSuddenly, Coleman's words hit me in the back of the neck. _If I got\nthrough the next twenty-four hours._ This had to be some kind of test.\n\nBut a test for what?\n\nHad I been deliberately told that I was living only a Dream to see\nif my ethics would hold up even when I thought I wasn't dealing with\nreality?\n\nOr if this _was_ only a Dream, was it a test to see if I was morally\nready to return to the real, the earnest world?\n\nBut if it was a test to see if I was ready for reality, did I want to\npass it? My life was nerve-racking and mind-wrecking, but I liked the\nchallenge--it was the only life I knew or could believe in.\n\nWhat was I going to do?\n\nThe only thing I knew was that I couldn't tune in tomorrow and find out.\n\nThe time was _now_.\n\nHorbit motioned the gun to my desk set. \"Sign that paper.\"\n\nI reached out and took hold of his wrist. I squeezed.\n\nHorbit's screams brought in the guards.\n\nI picked up the gun from where he had dropped it and handed it to\nCaptain Keller, my head guard, a tough old bird who wore his uniform\nlike armor.\n\n\"Trying to force his way back to the sleep tanks,\" I told Keller.\n\nHe nodded. \"Happened before. Back when old man Preston lost his grip.\"\n\nPreston had been my predecessor. He had lost his hold on reality like\nall the others before him who had served long as warden of Dreamland.\nA few had quit while they were still ahead and spent the rest of their\nlives recuperating. Our society didn't produce individuals tough enough\nto stand the strain of putting their fellow human beings to sleep for\nlong.\n\nOne of Keller's men had stabbed Horbit's arm with a hypospray to\nblanket the pain from his broken wrist, and the man was quieter.\n\n\"I couldn't have done it, Warden,\" Horbit mumbled drowsily. \"I couldn't\nkill anybody. Unless it was like that other time.\"\n\n\"Of course, Eddie,\" I said.\n\nI had banked on that, hadn't I, when I made my move?\n\nOr did I?\n\nWasn't it perhaps a matter of knowing that all of it wasn't real and\nthat the safety cutoffs in even a free-choice model of a Dream Machine\ncouldn't let me come to any real harm? I had been suspiciously brave,\ndisarming a dedicated maniac. With only an hour to spare for gym a day,\nI could barely press 350 pounds. I was hardly in shape for personal\ncombat.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe I actually wanted something to go wrong so my\nsleep sentence would be extended. Or was it that, in some sane part of\nmy mind, I wanted release from unreality badly enough to take any risk\nto prove that I was morally capable of returning to the real world?\n\nIt was a carrousel and I couldn't catch the brass ring no matter how\nmany turns I went spinning through.\n\nI hardly heard Horbit when he half-shouted at me as my men led him from\nthe room. Glancing up sharply, I saw him straining purposefully against\nthe bonds of muscle and narcotic that held him.\n\n\"You have to send me back now, Warden,\" he was shrilling. \"You have to!\nI tried to coerce you with a gun. That's a crime, Warden--you _know_\nthat's a crime! I have to be put to sleep!\"\n\nKeller flicked his mustache with a thick thumbnail. \"How about that?\nYou won't let a guy back into the sleepy-bye pads, so he pulls a gun\non you to make you, and _that_ makes him eligible. He couldn't lose,\nWarden. No, sir, he had it made.\"\n\nMy answer to Keller was forming, building up in my jaw muscles, but I\ntook a pill and it went away.\n\n\"Hold him in the detention quarters,\" I said finally. \"I'm going to\nmake a study of this.\"\n\nKeller winked knowingly and sauntered out of the office, his left hand\nswinging the blackjack the Committee had taken away from him a decade\nbefore.\n\nThe problem of what to do with Keller wasn't particularly atypical of\nthe ones I had to solve daily and I wasn't going to let that worry me.\nMuch.\n\nI pressed my button to let Mrs. Engle know I was ready for the next\ninterview.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey came. There were the hysterical relatives, the wives and mothers\nand brothers who demanded that their kin be Awakened because they were\nspecial cases, not really guilty, or needed at home, or possessed of\nsuch awesome talents and qualities as to be exempt from the laws of\nlesser men.\n\nOnce in a while I granted a parole for a prisoner to see a dying mother\nor if some important project was falling apart without his help, but\nmost of the time I just sat with my eyes propped open, letting a sea of\nvindictive screeching and beseeching wailings wash around me.\n\nThe relatives and legal talent were spaced with hungry-eyed mystics\nwho were convinced they could contemplate God and their navels\nboth conscientiously as an incarnation of Gautama. To risk sounding\nreligiously intolerant, I usually kicked these out pretty swiftly.\n\nThe onetime inmate who wanted back in after a reprieve was fairly rare.\nFew of them ever got _that_ crazy.\n\nBut it was my luck to get another the same day, _the_ day for me, as\nHorbit.\n\nPaulson was a tall, lean man with sad eyes. The clock above his sharp\nshoulder bone said five till noon. I didn't expect him to take much out\nof my lunch hour.\n\n\"Warden,\" Paulson said, \"I've decided to give myself up. I murdered a\nblind beggar the other night.\"\n\n\"For his pencils?\" I asked.\n\nPaulson shifted uneasily. \"No, sir. For his money. I needed some extra\ncash and I was stronger than he was, so why shouldn't I take it?\"\n\nI examined the projection of his file. He was an embezzler, not a\nviolent man. He had served his time and been released. Conceivably he\nmight embezzle again, but the Committee saw to it that temptation was\nnever again placed in his path. He would not commit a crime of violence.\n\n\"Look, Paulson,\" I said, a trifle testily, \"if you have so little\nconscience as to kill a blind old man for a few dollars, where do you\nsuddenly get enough guilt feelings to cause you to give yourself up?\"\n\nPaulson tried his insufficient best to smile evilly. \"It wasn't\nconscience, Warden. I never lie awake a minute whenever I kill\nanybody. It's just--well, Dreaming isn't so bad. Last time I was Allen\nPinkerton, the detective. It was exciting. A lot more exciting than the\nkind of life I lead.\"\n\nI nodded solemnly. \"Yes, no doubt strangling old men in the streets can\nbe pretty dull for a red-blooded man of action.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Paulson said earnestly, \"it does get to be a humdrum routine.\nI've been experimenting with all sorts of murders, but I just don't\nseem to get much of a kick out of them now. I'd like to try it from the\nother end as Pinkerton again. Of course, if you can't arrange it, I\nguess I'll have to go out and see what I can do with, say, an ax.\" His\neye glittered almost convincingly.\n\n\"Paulson, you know I could have you watched night and day if I thought\nyou really were a murderer. But I can't send you back to the sleep\nvaults without proof and conviction for a crime.\"\n\n\"That doesn't sound very reasonable,\" Paulson objected. \"Turning loose\na homicidal maniac who is offering to go back to the vaults of his own\nfree will just because you lack a little trifling proof of his guilt.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" I told him, \"but I don't want to share the same noose with you.\nMy job is to keep the innocent out and the convicted in. And I do my\njob, Paulson.\"\n\n\"But you have to! If you don't, I'll have to go out and establish my\nguilt with another crime. Do you want a crime on your hands, Warden?\"\n\nI studied his record. There was a chance, just a chance....\n\n\"Do you want to wait voluntarily in the detention quarters?\" I asked\nhim.\n\nHe agreed readily enough.\n\nI watched him out of the office and rang for lunch.\n\nThe news on the wall video was dull as usual. A man got tired of\nhearing peace, safety, prosperity and brotherly love all the time. I\ndug into my strained spinach, raw hamburger, and chewed up my white\npill, my red pill, my ebony pill, and my second white pill. The gin and\ntomato juice took the taste away.\n\nI was ready for the afternoon session.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMatrons were finishing the messy job of dragging a hysterical woman\nout of the office when Keller came back. He had a stubborn look on his\nflattened, red face.\n\n\"New prisoner asking to see you personal,\" Keller reported. \"Told him\nno. Okay?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said. \"He can see me. That's the law and you know it. He\nisn't violent, is he?\" I asked in some concern. The room was still in\ndisarray.\n\n\"Naw, he ain't violent, Warden. He just thinks he's somebody important.\"\n\n\"Sounds like a case for therapy, not Dreamland. Who does he think he\nis?\"\n\n\"One of the Committee--Councilman Coleman.\"\n\n\"Mm-hmm. And who is he really, Captain?\"\n\n\"Councilman Coleman.\"\n\nI whistled. \"What did they nail him on?\"\n\n\"Misuse of authority.\"\n\n\"And he didn't get a suspended for that?\"\n\n\"Wasn't his first offense. Still want to see him?\"\n\nI gave a lateral wave of my hand. \"Of course.\"\n\nMy pattern of living--call it my office routine--had been\nre-established through the day. I hadn't had a chance to brood much\nover the bombshell Coleman had tossed in my lap in the morning, but now\nI could think.\n\nColeman entered wearing the same black tunic, the same superior\nattitude. His black eyes fastened on me.\n\n\"Sit down, Councilman,\" I directed.\n\nHe deigned to comply.\n\nI studied the files flashed before me. Several times before, Coleman\nhad been guilty of slight misuses of his authority: helping his\nfriends, harming his enemies. Not enough to make him be impeached\nfrom the Committee. His job was so hypersensitive that if every\ntransgression earned dismissal, no one could hold the position more\nthan a day. Even with the best intentions, mistakes can be taken for\ndeliberate errors. Not to mention the converse. For his earlier errors,\nColeman had first received a suspended sentence, then two terminal\nsentences to be fixed by the warden. My predecessors had given him\nfirst a few weeks, then a few months of sleep in Dreamland.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nColeman's eyes didn't frighten me; I focused right on the pupils. \"That\nwas a pretty foul trick, Councilman. Did you hope to somehow frighten\nme out of executing this sentence by what you told me this morning?\"\n\nI couldn't follow his reasoning. Just how making me think my life was\nonly a Dream such as I imposed on my own prisoners could help him, I\ncouldn't see.\n\n\"Warden Walker,\" Coleman intoned in his magnificent voice, \"I'm\nshocked. _I_ am not personally monitoring your Dream. The Committee as\na whole will decide whether you are capable of returning to the real\nworld. Moreover, please don't get carried away. I'm not concerned with\nwhat you do to this sensory projection of myself, beyond how it helps\nto establish your moral capabilities.\"\n\n\"I suppose,\" I said heavily, \"that I could best establish my high moral\ncharacter by excusing you from this penal sentence?\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" Councilman Coleman asserted. \"According to the facts as\nyou know them, I am 'guilty' and must be confined.\"\n\nI was stymied for an instant. I had expected him to say that I must\nknow that he was incapable of committing such an error and I must\npardon him despite the misguided rulings of the courts. Then I thought\nof something else.\n\n\"You show symptoms of being a habitual criminal, Coleman. I think you\ndeserve _life_.\"\n\nColeman cocked his head thoughtfully, concerned. \"That seems rather\nextreme, Warden.\"\n\n\"You would suggest a shorter sentence?\"\n\n\"If it were my place to choose, yes. A few years, perhaps. But\nlife--no, I think not.\"\n\nI threw up my hands. You don't often see somebody do that, but I did.\nI couldn't figure him. Coleman had wealth and power as a councilman\nin the real world, but I had thought somehow he wanted to escape to a\nDream world. Yet he didn't want to be in for life, the way Paulson and\nHorbit did.\n\nThere seemed to be no point or profit in what he had told me that\nmorning, nothing in it for him.\n\nUnless--\n\nUnless what he said was literally true.\n\nI stood up. My knees wanted to quit halfway up, but I made it. \"This,\"\nI said, \"is a difficult decision for me, sir. Would you make yourself\ncomfortable here for a time, Councilman?\"\n\nColeman smiled benignly. \"Certainly, Warden.\"\n\nI walked out of my office, slowly and carefully.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHorbit was sitting in his detention quarters idly flicking through\na book tape on the Civil War when I found him. The tic in his cheek\nmarked time with every new page.\n\n\"President Lincoln,\" I said reverently.\n\nHorbit looked up, his eyes set in a clever new way. \"_You_ call me\nthat. Does it mean I am recovering? You don't mean now that I'm getting\nback my right senses?\"\n\n\"Mr. President, the situation you find yourself in now is something\nstranger and more evil than any madness. I am not a phantom of your\nmind--I am a _real_ man. This wild, distorted place is a _real_ place.\"\n\n\"Do you think you can pull the wool over my eyes, you scamp? Mine eyes\nhave seen the glory.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" I sat down beside him and looked earnestly into his\ntwitching face. \"But I know you have always believed in the occult.\"\n\nHe nodded slowly. \"I _have_ often suspected this was hell.\"\n\n\"Not quite, sir. The occult has its own rigid laws. It is perfectly\nscientific. This world is in another dimension--one that is not length,\nbreadth or thickness--but a real one nevertheless.\"\n\n\"An interesting theory. Go ahead.\"\n\n\"This world is more scientifically advanced than the one you come\nfrom--and this advanced science has fallen into the hands of a\nwell-meaning despot.\"\n\nHorbit nodded again. \"The Jefferson Davis type.\"\n\nHe didn't understand Lincoln's beliefs very well, but I pretended to\ngo along with him. \"Yes, sir. He--our leader--doubts your abilities as\nPresident. He is not above meddling in the affairs of an alien world\nif he believes he is doing good. He has convicted you to this world in\nthat belief.\"\n\nHe chuckled. \"Many of my countrymen share his convictions.\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" I said. \"But many here do not. I don't. I know you must return\nto guide the Reconstruction. But first you must convince our leader of\nyour worth.\"\n\n\"How am I going to accomplish that?\" Horbit asked worriedly.\n\n\"You are going to have a companion from now on, an agent of the leader,\nwho will pretend to be something he isn't. You must pretend to believe\nin what he claims to be, and convince him of your high intelligence,\nmoral responsibilities, and qualities of leadership.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Horbit said thoughtfully, \"yes. I must try to curb my tendency\nfor telling off-color jokes. My wife is always nagging me about that.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPaulson was only a few doors away from Horbit. I found him with his\nlong, thin legs stretched out in front of him, staring dismally into\nthe gloom of the room. No wonder he found reality so boring and\ndepressing with so downbeat a mood cycle. I wondered why they hadn't\nbeen able to do something about adjusting his metabolism.\n\n\"Paulson,\" I said gently, \"I want to speak with you.\"\n\nHe bolted upright in his chair. \"You're going to put me back to sleep.\"\n\n\"I came to talk to you about that,\" I admitted.\n\nI pulled up a seat and adjusted the lighting so only his face and mine\nseemed to float bodiless in a sea of night, two moons of flesh.\n\n\"Paulson--or should I call you Pinkerton?--this will come as a shock, a\nshock I know only a fine analytical mind like yours could stand. You\nthink your life as the great detective was only a Dream induced by some\nmiraculous machine. But, sir, believe me: that life was _real_.\"\n\nPaulson's eyes rolled slightly back into his head and changed their\nluster. \"Then _this_ is the Dream. I've thought--\"\n\n\"No!\" I snapped. \"This world is also real.\"\n\nI went through the same Fourth Dimension waltz as I had auditioned for\nHorbit. At the end of it, Paulson was nodding just as eagerly.\n\n\"I could be destroyed for telling you this, but our leader is planning\nthe most gigantic conquest known to any intelligent race in the\nUniverse. He is going to conquer Earth in all its possible futures and\nall its possible pasts. After that, there are other planets.\"\n\n\"He must be stopped!\" Paulson shouted.\n\nI laid my palm on his arm. \"Armies can't stop him, nor can fantastic\nsecret weapons. Only one thing can stop him: the greatest detective who\never lived. Pinkerton!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Paulson said. \"I suppose I could.\"\n\n\"He knows that. But he's a fiend. He wants a battle of wits with you,\nhis only possible foe, for the satisfaction of making a fool of you.\"\n\n\"Easier said than done, my friend,\" Paulson said crisply.\n\n\"True,\" I agreed, \"but he is devious, the devil! He plans to convince\nyou that he also has been removed to this world from his own, even as\nyou have. He will claim to be Abraham Lincoln.\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"Yes, and he will pretend to find you accidentally and get you to help\nhim find a way back to his own world, glorying in making a fool of you.\nBut you can use every moment to learn his every weakness.\"\n\n\"But wait. I know President Lincoln well. I guarded him on his first\ninauguration trip. How could this leader of yours fool me? Does he look\nlike the President?\"\n\n\"Not at all. But remember, the dimensional shift changes physical\nappearance. You've noticed that in yourself.\"\n\n\"Yes, of course,\" Paulson muttered. \"But he couldn't hoax me. My keen\npowers of deduction would have seen through him in an instant!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI saw Horbit and Paulson happily off in each other's company. Paulson\nwas no longer bored by a reality in which he was matching wits with\nthe first master criminal of the paratime universe, and Horbit was no\nlonger hopeless in his quest to gain another reality because he knew\nhe was not merely insane now.\n\nIt was a pair of fantastic stories that no man in his right mind would\nbelieve--but that didn't make them invalid to a brace of ex-Sleepers.\nThey _wanted_ to believe them. The stories gave them what they were\nafter--without me having to break the law and put them to sleep for\ncrimes they hadn't committed.\n\nThey would find out some day that I had lied to them, but maybe by that\ntime they would have realized this world wasn't so bad.\n\nFortunately, I was confident from their psych records that they were\nboth incapable of ending their little game by homicide, no matter how\njustified they might think it was.\n\n\"Hey, Warden,\" Captain Keller bellowed as I approached my office\ndoor, \"when are you going to let me throw that stiff Coleman into the\nsleepy-bye vaults? He's still sitting in there on your furniture as\nsmug as you please.\"\n\n\"You don't sound as if you like our distinguished visitor very well,\" I\nremarked.\n\n\"It's not that. I just don't think he deserves any special privileges.\nBesides, it was guys like him that took away our nightsticks. My boys\ndidn't like that. Look at me--I'm defenseless!\"\n\nI looked at his square figure. \"Not quite, Captain, not quite.\"\n\nNow was the time.\n\nI stretched out my wet palm toward the door.\n\nWas or was not Coleman telling the truth when he said this life of mine\nwas itself only a Dream? If it was, did I want to finish my last day\nwith the right decision so I could return to some alien reality? Or did\nI deliberately want to make a mistake so I could continue living the\nopiate of my Dream?\n\nThen, as I touched the door, I knew the only decision that could have\nany meaning for me.\n\nCouncilman Coleman didn't look as if he had moved since I had left him.\nHe was unwrinkled, unperspiring, his eyes and mustache crisp as ever.\nHe smiled at me briefly in supreme confidence.\n\nI changed my decision then, in that moment. And, in the next, changed\nit back to my original choice.\n\n\"Coleman,\" I said, \"you can get out of here. As warden, I'm granting\nyou a five-year probation.\"\n\nThe councilman stood up swiftly, his eyes catching little sparks\nof yellow light. \"I don't approve of your decision, Warden. Not at\nall. Unless you alter it, I'll be forced to convince the rest of the\nCommittee that your decisions are becoming faulty, that you are losing\nyour grip just as all your predecessors did.\"\n\nMy muscles relaxed in a spasm and it took the fresh flow of adrenalin\nto get me to the chair behind my desk. I took a pill. I took two pills.\n\n\"Tell me, Councilman, what happened to the offer to release me from\nthis phony Dream? Now you are talking as if _this_ world was the _real_\none.\"\n\nColeman parted his lips, but then the planes of his face shifted into\nanother pattern. \"You never believed me.\"\n\n\"Almost, but not quite. You knew I was on the narrow edge in this kind\nof job, but I'm not as far out as you seemed to have thought.\"\n\n\"I can still wreck your career, you know.\"\n\n\"I don't think so. That would constitute a misuse of authority, and\nthe next time you turn up before me, I'm going to give you _life_ in\nDreamland.\"\n\nColeman sat back down suddenly.\n\n\"You don't want life as a Sleeper, do you?\" I pursued. \"You did want\na relatively _short_ sentence of a few months or a few years. I can\nthink of two reasons why. The answer is probably a combination of\nboth. In the first place, you are a joy-popper with Dreams--you don't\nwant to live out your life in one, but you like a brief Dream every\nfew years like an occasional dose of a narcotic. In the second place,\nyou probably have political reasons for wanting to hide out somewhere\nin safety for the next few years. The world isn't as placid as the\nnewscasts sometimes make it seem.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe didn't say anything. I didn't think he had to.\n\n\"You wanted to make sure I made a painfully scrupulous decision in\nyour case,\" I went on. \"You didn't want me to pardon you completely\nbecause of your high position, but at the same time you didn't want too\nlong a sentence. But I'm doing you no favors. You get no time from me,\nColeman.\"\n\n\"How did you decide to do this?\" he asked. \"Don't tell me you never\ndoubted. We've all doubted since we found out about the machines: which\nwas real and which was the Dream? How did you decide to risk this?\"\n\n\"I acted the only way I could act,\" I said. \"I decided I had to act as\nif my life was real and that you were lying. I decided that because, if\nall this were false, if I could have no more confidence in my own mind\nand my own senses than that, I didn't give a damn if it _were_ all a\nDream.\"\n\nColeman stood up and walked out of my office.\n\nThe clock told me it was after five. I began clearing my desk.\n\nCaptain Keller stuck his head in, unannounced. \"Hey, Warden, there's an\nactive one out here. He claims that Dreamland compromises His plan for\nthe Free Will of the Universe.\"\n\n\"Well, escort him inside, Captain,\" I said.\n\nI put away my pills. Solving simple problems such as the new visitor\npresented always helped me to relax.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of No Substitutions, by Jim Harmon\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK NO SUBSTITUTIONS ***\n\n***** This file should be named 51350.txt or 51350.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/1/3/5/51350/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
