The feather-tailed jet was golden, and\nbrighter than the sun. Poised above it was a glistening metallic\nobject, fabricated rather than natural, hauntingly familiar. The Quedak\ntried to think what it was.\n\nHe couldn't remember. His memories had atrophied with his functions,\nleaving only scattered fragments of images. He searched among them now,\nleafing through his brief scraps of ruined cities, dying populations, a\nblue-water-filled canal, two moons, a spaceship....\n\nThat was it. The descending object was a _spaceship_. There had been\nmany of them during the great days of the Quedak.\n\nThose great days were over, buried forever beneath the powdery sands.\nOnly the Quedak remained. He had life and he had a mission to perform.\nThe driving urgency of his mission remained, even after memory and\nfunction had failed.\n\nAs the Quedak watched, the spaceship dipped lower. It wobbled and\nsidejets kicked out to straighten it. With a gentle explosion of dust,\nthe spaceship settled tail first on the arid plain.\n\nAnd the Quedak, driven by the imperative Quedak mission, dragged itself\npainfully down from the little hilltop. Every movement was an agony. If\nhe were a selfish creature, the Quedak would have died. But he was not\nselfish. Quedaks owed a duty to the universe; and that spaceship, after\nall the blank years, was a link to other worlds, to planets where the\nQuedak could live again and give his services to the native fauna.\n\nHe crawled, a centimeter at a time, and wondered whether he had the\nstrength to reach the alien spaceship before it left this dusty, dead\nplanet.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCaptain Jensen of the spaceship _Southern Cross_ was bored sick with\nMars. He and his men had been here for ten days. They had found no\nimportant archeological specimens, no tantalizing hints of ancient\ncities such as the _Polaris_ expedition had discovered at the South\nPole. Here there was nothing but sand, a few weary shrubs, and a\nrolling hill or two. Their biggest find so far had been three pottery\nshards.\n\nJensen readjusted his oxygen booster. Over the rise of a hill he saw\nhis two men returning.\n\n\"Anything interesting?\" he asked.\n\n\"Just this,\" said engineer Vayne, holding up an inch of corroded blade\nwithout a handle.\n\n\"Better than nothing,\" Jensen said. \"How about you, Wilks?\"\n\nThe navigator shrugged his shoulders. \"Just photographs of the\nlandscape.\"\n\n\"OK,\" Jensen said. \"Dump everything into the sterilizer and let's get\ngoing.\"\n\nWilks looked mournful. \"Captain, one quick sweep to the north might\nturn up something really--\"\n\n\"Not a chance,\" Jensen said. \"Fuel, food, water, everything was\ncalculated for a ten-day stay. That's three days longer than _Polaris_\nhad. We're taking off this evening.\"\n\nThe men nodded. They had no reason to complain. As the second to land\non Mars, they were sure of a small but respectable footnote in the\nhistory books. They put their equipment through the sterilizer vent,\nsealed it, and climbed the ladder to the lock. Once they were inside,\nVayne closed and dogged the hatch, and started to open the inside\npressure door.\n\n\"Hold it!\" Jensen called out.\n\n\"What's the matter?\"\n\n\"I thought I saw something on your boot,\" Jensen said. \"Something like\na big bug.\"\n\nVayne quickly ran his hands down the sides of his boots. The two men\ncircled him, examining his clothing.\n\n\"Shut that inner door,\" the captain said. \"Wilks, did you see anything?\"\n\n\"Not a thing,\" the navigator said. \"Are you sure, Cap? We haven't found\nanything that looks like animal or insect life here. Only a few plants.\"\n\n\"I could have sworn I saw something,\" Jensen said. \"Maybe I was\nwrong.... Anyhow, we'll fumigate our clothes before we enter the ship\nproper. No sense taking any chance of bringing back some kind of\nMartian bug.\"\n\nThe men removed their clothing and boots and stuffed them into the\nchute. They searched the bare steel room carefully.\n\n\"Nothing here,\" Jensen said at last. \"OK, let's go inside.\"\n\nOnce inside the ship, they sealed off the lock and fumigated it. The\nQuedak, who had crept inside earlier through the partially opened\npressure door, listened to the distant hiss of gas. After a while he\nheard the jets begin to fire.\n\nThe Quedak retreated to the dark rear of the ship. He found a metal\nshelf and attached himself to the underside of it near the wall. After\na while he felt the ship tremble.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Quedak clung to the shelf during the long, slow flight through\nspace. He had forgotten what spaceships were like, but now memory\nrevived briefly. He felt blazing heat and freezing cold. Adjusting to\nthe temperature changes drained his small store of vitality, and the\nQuedak began to wonder if he was going to die.\n\nHe _refused_ to die. Not while there was still a possibility of\naccomplishing the Quedak mission.\n\nIn time he felt the harsh pull of gravity, and felt the main jets\nfiring again. The ship was coming down to its planet.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter a routine landing, Captain Jensen and his men were taken to Medic\nCheckpoint, where they were thumped, probed and tested for any sign of\ndisease.\n\nTheir spaceship was lowered to a flatcar and taken past rows of\nmoonships and ICBMs to Decontamination Stage One. Here the sealed outer\nhull was washed down with powerful cleansing sprays. By evening, the\nship was taken to Decontamination Stage Two.\n\nA team of two inspectors equipped with bulky tanks and hoses undogged\nthe hatch and entered, shutting the hatch behind them.\n\nThey began at the bow, methodically spraying as they moved toward the\nrear. Everything seemed in order; no animals or plants, no trace of\nmold such as the first Luna expedition had brought back.\n\n\"Do you really think this is necessary?\" the assistant inspector asked.\nHe had already requested a transfer to Flight Control.\n\n\"Sure it is,\" the senior inspector said. \"Can't tell what these ships\nmight bring in.\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" the assistant said. \"Still, a Martian whoosis wouldn't\neven be able to live on Earth. Would it?\"\n\n\"How should I know?\" the senior inspector said. \"I'm no botanist. Maybe\nthey don't know, either.\"\n\n\"Seems like a waste of--hey!\"\n\n\"What is it?\" the senior inspector asked.\n\n\"I thought I saw something,\" the assistant said. \"Looked a little like\na palmetto bug. Over by that shelf.\"\n\nThe senior inspector adjusted his respirator more snugly over his face\nand motioned to his assistant to do the same. He advanced slowly toward\nthe shelf, unfastening a second nozzle from the pressure tank on his\nback. He turned it on, and a cloud of greenish gas sprayed out.\n\n\"There,\" the senior inspector said. \"That should take care of your\nbug.\" He knelt down and looked under the shelf. \"Nothing here.\"\n\n\"It was probably a shadow,\" the assistant said.\n\nTogether they sprayed the entire interior of the ship, paying\nparticular attention to the small box of Martian artifacts. They left\nthe gas-filled ship and dogged the hatch again.\n\n\"Now what?\" the assistant asked.\n\n\"Now we leave the ship sealed for three days,\" the senior inspector\nsaid. \"Then we inspect again. You find me the animal that'll live\nthrough that.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Quedak, who had been clinging to the underside of the assistant's\nshoe between the heel and the sole, released his hold. He watched the\nshadowy biped figures move away, talking in their deep, rumbling,\nindecipherable voices. He felt tired and unutterably lonely.\n\nBut buoying him up was the thought of the Quedak mission. Only that\nwas important. The first part of the mission was accomplished. He had\nlanded safely on an inhabited planet. Now he needed food and drink.\nThen he had to have rest, a great deal of rest to restore his dormant\nfaculties. After that he would be ready to give this world what it so\nobviously needed--the cooperation possible only through the Quedak mind.\n\nHe crept slowly down the shadowy yard, past the deserted hulls of\nspaceships. He came to a wire fence and sensed the high-voltage\nelectricity running through it. Gauging his distance carefully, the\nQuedak jumped safely through one of the openings in the mesh.\n\nThis was a very different section. From here the Quedak could smell\nwater and food. He moved hastily forward, then stopped.\n\nHe sensed the presence of a man. And something else. Something much\nmore menacing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Who's there?\" the watchman called out. He waited, his revolver in one\nhand, his flashlight in the other. Thieves had broken into the yards\nlast week; they had stolen three cases of computer parts bound for Rio.\nTonight he was ready for them.\n\nHe walked forward, an old, keen-eyed man holding his revolver in a\nrock-steady fist. The beam of his flashlight probed among the cargoes.\nThe yellow light flickered along a great pile of precision machine\ntools for South Africa, past a water-extraction plant for Jordan and a\npile of mixed goods for Rabaul.\n\n\"You better come out,\" the watchman shouted. His flashlight probed at\nsacks of rice for Shanghai and power saws for Burma. Then the beam of\nlight stopped abruptly.\n\n\"I'll be damned,\" the watchman said. Then he laughed. A huge and\nred-eyed rat was glaring into the beam of his flashlight. It had\nsomething in its jaws, something that looked like an unusually large\ncockroach.\n\n\"Good eating,\" the watchman said. He holstered his revolver and\ncontinued his patrol.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA large black animal had seized the Quedak, and he felt heavy jaws\nclose over his back. He tried to fight; but, blinded by a sudden beam\nof yellow light, he was betrayed by total and enervating confusion.\n\nThe yellow light went off. The black beast bit down hard on the\nQuedak's armored back. The Quedak mustered his remaining strength, and,\nuncoiling his long, scorpion-jointed tail, lashed out.\n\nHe missed, but the black beast released him hastily. They circled\neach other, the Quedak hoisting his tail for a second blow, the beast\nunwilling to turn loose this prey.\n\nThe Quedak waited for his chance. Elation filled him. This pugnacious\nanimal could be the first, the first on this planet to experience the\nQuedak mission. From this humble creature a start could be made....\n\nThe beast sprang and its white teeth clicked together viciously.\nThe Quedak moved out of the way and its barb-headed tail flashed\nout, fastening itself in the beast's back. The Quedak held on grimly\nwhile the beast leaped and squirmed. Setting his feet, the Quedak\nconcentrated on the all-important task of pumping a tiny white crystal\ndown the length of his tail and under the beast's skin.\n\nBut this most important of the Quedak faculties was still dormant.\nUnable to accomplish anything, the Quedak released his barbs, and,\ntaking careful aim, accurately drove his sting home between the black\nbeast's eyes. The blow, as the Quedak had known, was lethal.\n\nThe Quedak took nourishment from the body of its dead foe; regretfully,\nfor by inclination the Quedak was herbivorous. When he had finished,\nthe Quedak knew that he was in desperate need of a long period of rest.\nOnly after that could the full Quedak powers be regained.\n\nHe crawled up and down the piles of goods in the yard, looking for a\nplace to hide. Carefully he examined several bales. At last he reached\na stack of heavy boxes. One of the boxes had a crack just large enough\nto admit him.\n\nThe Quedak crawled inside, down the shiny, oil-slick surface of a\nmachine, to the far end of the box. There he went into the dreamless,\ndefenseless sleep of the Quedak, serenely trusting in what the future\nwould bring.\n\n\nPART TWO\n\n\nI\n\nThe big gaff-headed schooner was pointed directly at the reef-enclosed\nisland, moving toward it with the solidity of an express train. The\nsails billowed under powerful gusts of the northwest breeze, and the\nrusty Allison-Chambers diesel rumbled beneath a teak grating. The\nskipper and mate stood on the bridge deck and watched the reef approach.\n\n\"Anything yet?\" the skipper asked. He was a stocky, balding man with\na perpetual frown on his face. He had been sailing his schooner among\nthe uncharted shoals and reefs of the Southwest Pacific for twenty-five\nyears. He frowned because his old ship was not insurable. His deck\ncargo, however, _was_ insured. Some of it had come all the way from\nOgdensville, that transshipment center in the desert where spaceships\nlanded.\n\n\"Not a thing,\" the mate said. He was watching the dazzling white wall\nof coral, looking for the gleam of blue that would reveal the narrow\npass to the inner lagoon. This was his first trip to the Solomon\nIslands. A former television repairman in Sydney before he got the\nwanderlust, the mate wondered if the skipper had gone crazy and planned\na spectacular suicide against the reef.\n\n\"Still nothing!\" he shouted. \"Shoals ahead!\"\n\n\"I'll take it,\" the skipper said to the helmsman. He gripped the wheel\nand watched the unbroken face of the reef.\n\n\"Nothing,\" the mate said. \"Skipper, we'd better come about.\"\n\n\"Not if we're going to get through the pass,\" the skipper said. He was\nbeginning to get worried. But he had promised to deliver goods to the\nAmerican treasure-hunters on this island, and the skipper's word was\nhis bond. He had picked up the cargo in Rabaul and made his usual stops\nat the settlements on New Georgia and Malaita. When he finished here,\nhe could look forward to a thousand-mile run to New Caledonia.\n\n\"There it is!\" the mate shouted.\n\nA thin slit of blue had appeared in the coral wall. They were less than\nthirty yards from it now, and the old schooner was making close to\neight knots.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs the ship entered the pass, the skipper threw the wheel hard over.\nThe schooner spun on its keel. Coral flashed by on either side, close\nenough to touch. There was a metallic shriek as an upper main-mast\nspreader snagged and came free. Then they were in the pass, bucking a\nsix-knot current.\n\nThe mate pushed the diesel to full throttle, then sprang back to help\nthe skipper wrestle with the wheel. Under sail and power the schooner\nforged through the pass, scraped by an outcropping to port, and came\nonto the placid surface of the lagoon.\n\nThe skipper mopped his forehead with a large blue bandanna. \"Very snug\nwork,\" he said.\n\n\"_Snug!_\" the mate cried. He turned away, and the skipper smiled a\nbrief smile.\n\nThey slid past a small ketch riding at anchor. The native hands took\ndown sail and the schooner nosed up to a rickety pier that jutted out\nfrom the beach. Lines were made fast to palm trees. From the fringe of\njungle above the beach a white man came down, walking briskly in the\nnoonday heat.\n\nHe was very tall and thin, with knobby knees and elbows. The fierce\nMelanesian sun had burned out but not tanned him, and his nose and\ncheekbones were peeling. His horn-rimmed glasses had broken at the\nhinge and been repaired with a piece of tape. He looked eager, boyish,\nand curiously naive.\n\nOne hell-of-a-looking treasure-hunter, the mate thought.\n\n\"Glad to see you!\" the man called out. \"We'd about given you up for\nlost.\"\n\n\"Not likely,\" the skipper said. \"Mr. Sorensen, I'd like you to meet my\nnew mate, Mr. Willis.\"\n\n\"Glad to meet you, Professor,\" the mate said.\n\n\"I'm not a professor,\" Sorensen said, \"but thanks anyhow.\"\n\n\"Where are the others?\" the skipper asked.\n\n\"Out in the jungle,\" Sorensen said. \"All except Drake, and he'll be\ndown here shortly. You'll stay a while, won't you?\"\n\n\"Only to unload,\" the skipper said. \"Have to catch the tide out of\nhere. How's the treasure-hunting?\"\n\n\"We've done a lot of digging,\" Sorensen said. \"We still have our hopes.\"\n\n\"But no doubloons yet?\" the skipper asked. \"No pieces of eight?\"\n\n\"Not a damned one,\" Sorensen said wearily. \"Did you bring the\nnewspapers, Skipper?\"\n\n\"That I did,\" Sorensen replied. \"They're in the cabin. Did you hear\nabout that second spaceship going to Mars?\"\n\n\"Heard about it on the short wave,\" Sorensen said. \"It didn't bring\nback much, did it?\"\n\n\"Practically nothing. Still, just think of it. _Two_ spaceships to\nMars, and I hear they're getting ready to put one on Venus.\"\n\nThe three men looked around them and grinned.\n\n\"Well,\" the skipper said, \"I guess maybe the space age hasn't reached\nthe Southwest Pacific yet. And it certainly hasn't gotten to _this_\nplace. Come on, let's unload the cargo.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis place was the island of Vuanu, southernmost of the Solomons,\nalmost in the Louisade Archipelago. It was a fair-sized volcanic\nisland, almost twenty miles long and several wide. Once it had\nsupported half a dozen native villages. But the population had begun to\ndecline after the depredations of the blackbirders in the 1850s. Then\na measles epidemic wiped out almost all the rest, and the survivors\nemigrated to New Georgia. A ship-watcher had been stationed here during\nthe Second World War, but no ships had come this way. The Japanese\ninvasion had poured across New Guinea and the upper Solomons, and\nfurther north through Micronesia. At the end of the war Vuanu was still\ndeserted. It was not made into a bird sanctuary like Canton Island,\nor a cable station like Christmas Island, or a refueling point like\nCocos-Keeling. No one even wanted to explode alphabet bombs on it.\nVuanu was a worthless, humid, jungle-covered piece of land, free to\nanyone who wanted it.\n\nWilliam Sorensen, general manager of a chain of liquor stores in\nCalifornia, decided he wanted it.\n\nSorensen's hobby was treasure-hunting. He had looked for Lafitte's\ntreasure in Louisiana and Texas, and for the Lost Dutchman Mine\nin Arizona. He had found neither. His luck had been better on the\nwreck-strewn Gulf coast, and on an expedition to Dagger Cay in the\nCaribbean he had found a double handful of Spanish coins in a rotting\ncanvas bag. The coins were worth about three thousand dollars. The\nexpedition had cost very much more, but Sorensen felt amply repaid.\n\nFor many years he had been interested in the Spanish treasure galleon\n_Santa Teresa_. Contemporary accounts told how the ship, heavily laden\nwith bullion, sailed from Manila in 1689. The clumsy ship, caught in a\nstorm, had run off to the south and been wrecked. Eighteen survivors\nmanaged to get ashore with the treasure. They buried it, and set sail\nfor the Phillipines in the ship's pinnacle. Two of them were alive when\nthe boat reached Manila.\n\nThe treasure island was tentatively identified as one of the Solomons.\nBut which one?\n\nNo one knew. Treasure-hunters looked for the cache on Bougainville\nand Buka. There was a rumor about it on Malaita, and even Ontong Java\nreceived an expedition. But no treasure was recovered.\n\nSorensen, researching the problem thoroughly, decided that the _Santa\nTeresa_ had sailed completely through the Solomons, almost to the\nLouisades. The ship must have escaped destruction until it crashed into\nthe reef at Vuanu.\n\nHis desire to search for the treasure might have remained only a dream\nif he hadn't met Dan Drake. Drake was also an amateur treasure-hunter.\nMore important, he owned a fifty-five-foot Hanna ketch.\n\nOver an evening's drinks the Vuanu expedition was born.\n\nAdditional members were recruited. Drake's ketch was put into seagoing\ncondition, equipment and money saved or gathered. Several other\npossible treasure sites in the Southwest Pacific were researched.\nFinally, vacation time was synchronized and the expedition got under\nway.\n\nThey had put in three months' work on Vuanu already. Their morale was\nhigh, in spite of inevitable conflicts between members. This schooner,\nbringing in supplies from Sydney and Rabaul, was the last civilized\ncontact they would have for another six months.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhile Sorensen nervously supervised, the crew of the schooner unloaded\nthe cargo. He didn't want any of the equipment, some of it shipped over\nsix thousand miles, to be broken now. No replacements were possible;\nwhatever they didn't have, they would have to do without. He breathed\nout in relief when the last crate, containing a metals detector, was\nsafely hoisted over the side and put on the beach above the high-water\nmark.\n\nThere was something odd about that box. He examined it and found a\nquarter-sized hole in one end. It had not been properly sealed.\n\nDan Drake, the co-manager of the expedition, joined him. \"What's\nwrong?\" Drake asked.\n\n\"Hole in that crate,\" Sorensen said. \"Salt water might have gotten in.\nWe'll be in tough shape if this detector doesn't work.\"\n\nDrake nodded. \"We better open it and see.\" He was a short, deeply\ntanned, broad-chested man with close-cropped black hair and a straggly\nmustache. He wore an old yachting cap jammed down over his eyes, giving\nhis face a tough bulldog look. He pulled a big screwdriver from his\nbelt and inserted it into the crack.\n\n\"Wait a moment,\" Sorensen said. \"Let's get it up to the camp first.\nEasier to carry the crate than something packed in grease.\"\n\n\"Right,\" Drake said. \"Take the other end.\"\n\nThe camp was built in a clearing a hundred yards from the beach, on the\nsite of an abandoned native village. They had been able to re-thatch\nseveral huts, and there was an old copra shed with a galvanized iron\nroof where they stored their supplies. Here they got the benefit of any\nbreeze from the sea. Beyond the clearing, the gray-green jungle sprang\nup like a solid wall.\n\nSorensen and Drake set the case down. The skipper, who had accompanied\nthem with the newspapers, looked around at the bleak huts and shook his\nhead.\n\n\"Would you like a drink, Skipper?\" Sorensen asked. \"Afraid we can't\noffer any ice.\"\n\n\"A drink would be fine,\" the skipper said. He wondered what drove\nmen to a godforsaken place like this in search of imaginary Spanish\ntreasure.\n\nSorensen went into one of the huts and brought out a bottle of Scotch\nand a tin cup. Drake had taken out his screwdriver and was vigorously\nripping boards off the crate.\n\n\"How does it look?\" Sorensen asked.\n\n\"It's OK,\" Drake said, gently lifting out the metals detector. \"Heavily\ngreased. Doesn't seem like there was any damage--\"\n\nHe jumped back. The skipper had come forward and stamped down heavily\non the sand.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" Sorensen asked.\n\n\"Looked like a scorpion,\" the skipper said. \"Damned thing crawled right\nout of your crate there. Might have bit you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSorensen shrugged. He had gotten used to the presence of an infinite\nnumber of insects during his three months on Vuanu. Another bug more or\nless didn't seem to make much difference.\n\n\"Another drink?\" he asked.\n\n\"Can't do it,\" the skipper said regretfully. \"I'd better get started.\nAll your party healthy?\"\n\n\"All healthy so far,\" Sorensen said. He smiled. \"Except for some bad\ncases of gold fever.\"\n\n\"You'll never find gold in this place,\" the skipper said seriously.\n\"I'll look in on you in about six months. Good luck.\"\n\nAfter shaking hands, the skipper went down to the beach and boarded his\nship. As the first pink flush of sunset touched the sky, the schooner\nwas under way. Sorensen and Drake watched it negotiate the pass. For a\nfew minutes its masts were visible above the reef. Then they had dipped\nbelow the horizon.\n\n\"That's that,\" Drake said. \"Us crazy American treasure-hunters are\nalone again.\"\n\n\"You don't think he suspected anything?\" Sorensen asked.\n\n\"Definitely not. As far as he's concerned, we're just crackpots.\"\n\nGrinning, they looked back at their camp. Under the copra shed was\nnearly fifty thousand dollars worth of gold and silver bullion, dug out\nof the jungle and carefully reburied. They had located a part of the\n_Santa Teresa_ treasure during their first month on the island. There\nwas every indication of more to come. Since they had no legal title to\nthe land, the expedition was not eager to let the news get out. Once it\nwas known, every gold-hungry vagabond from Perth to Papeete would be\nheading to Vuanu.\n\n\"The boy'll be in soon,\" Drake said. \"Let's get some stew going.\"\n\n\"Right,\" Sorensen said. He took a few steps and stopped. \"That's funny.\"\n\n\"What is?\"\n\n\"That scorpion the skipper squashed. It's gone.\"\n\n\"Maybe he missed it,\" Drake said. \"Or maybe he just pushed it down into\nthe sand. What difference does it make?\"\n\n\"None, I guess,\" Sorensen said.\n\n\nII\n\nEdward Eakins walked through the jungle with a long-handled spade on\nhis shoulder, sucking reflectively on a piece of candy. It was the\nfirst he'd had in weeks, and he was enjoying it to the utmost. He\nwas in very good spirits. The schooner yesterday had brought in not\nonly machinery and replacement parts, but also candy, cigarettes and\nfood. He had eaten scrambled eggs this morning, and real bacon. The\nexpedition was becoming almost civilized.\n\nSomething rustled in the bushes near him. He marched on, ignoring it.\n\nHe was a lean, sandy-haired man, amiable and slouching, with pale blue\neyes and an unprepossessing manner. He felt very lucky to have been\ntaken on the expedition. His gas station didn't put him on a financial\npar with the others, and he hadn't been able to put up a full share\nof the money. He still felt guilty about that. He had been accepted\nbecause he was an eager and indefatigable treasure-hunter with a good\nknowledge of jungle ways. Equally important, he was a skilled radio\noperator and repairman. He had kept the transmitter on the ketch in\nworking condition in spite of salt water and mildew.\n\nHe could pay his full share now, of course. But _now_, when they were\npractically rich, didn't really count. He wished there were some way he\ncould--\n\nThere was that rustle in the bushes again.\n\nEakins stopped and waited. The bushes trembled. And out stepped a mouse.\n\nEakins was amazed. The mice on this island, like most wild animal life,\nwere terrified of man. Although they feasted off the refuse of the\ncamp--when the rats didn't get it first--they carefully avoided any\ncontact with humans.\n\n\"You better get yourself home,\" Eakins said to the mouse.\n\nThe mouse stared at him. He stared back. It was a pretty little mouse,\nno more than four or five inches long, and colored a light tawny brown.\nIt didn't seem afraid.\n\n\"So long, mouse,\" Eakins said. \"I got work to do.\" He shifted his spade\nto the other shoulder and turned to go. As he turned, he caught a flash\nof brown out of the corner of his eye. Instinctively he ducked. The\nmouse whirled past him, turned, and gathered itself for another leap.\n\n\"Mouse, are you out of your head?\" Eakins asked.\n\nThe mouse bared its tiny teeth and sprang. Eakins knocked it aside.\n\n\"Now get the hell out of here,\" he said. He was beginning to wonder if\nthe rodent was crazy. Did it have rabies, perhaps?\n\nThe mouse gathered itself for another charge. Eakins lifted the spade\noff his shoulders and waited. When the mouse sprang, he met it with a\ncarefully timed blow. Then carefully, regretfully, he battered it to\ndeath.\n\n\"Can't have rabid mice running around,\" he said.\n\nBut the mouse hadn't seemed rabid; it had just seemed very determined.\n\nEakins scratched his head. Now what, he wondered, had gotten into that\nlittle mouse?\n\nIn the camp that evening, Eakins' story was greeted with hoots of\nlaughter. It was just like Eakins to be attacked by a mouse. Several\nmen suggested that he go armed in case the mouse's family wanted\nrevenge. Eakins just smiled sheepishly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTwo days later, Sorensen and Al Cable were finishing up a morning's\nhard work at Site 4, two miles from the camp. The metals detector had\nshown marked activity at this spot. They were seven feet down and\nnothing had been produced yet except a high mound of yellow-brown earth.\n\n\"That detector must be wrong,\" Cable said, wiping his face wearily.\nHe was a big, pinkish man. He had sweated off twenty pounds on Vuanu,\npicked up a bad case of prickly heat, and had enough treasure-hunting\nto last him a lifetime. He wished he were back in Baltimore taking care\nof his used-car agency. He didn't hesitate to say so, often and loudly.\nHe was one member who had not worked out well.\n\n\"Nothing wrong with the detector,\" Sorensen said. \"Trouble is, we're\ndigging in swampy ground. The cache must have sunk.\"\n\n\"It's probably a hundred feet down,\" Cable said, stabbing angrily at\nthe gluey mud.\n\n\"Nope,\" Sorensen said. \"There's volcanic rock under us, no more than\ntwenty feet down.\"\n\n\"Twenty feet? We should have a bulldozer.\"\n\n\"Might be costly bringing one in,\" Sorensen said mildly. \"Come on, Al,\nlet's get back to camp.\"\n\nSorensen helped Cable out of the excavation. They cleaned off their\ntools and started toward the narrow path leading back to the camp. They\nstopped abruptly.\n\nA large, ugly bird had stepped out of the brush. It was standing on the\npath, blocking their way.\n\n\"What in hell is that?\" Cable asked.\n\n\"A cassowary,\" Sorensen said.\n\n\"Well, let's boot it out of the way and get going.\"\n\n\"Take it easy,\" Sorensen said. \"If anyone does any booting, it'll be\nthe bird. Back away slowly.\"\n\nThe cassowary was nearly five feet high, a black-feathered ostrich-like\nbird standing erect on powerful legs. Each of its feet was three-toed,\nand the toes curved into heavy talons. It had a yellowish, bony head\nand short, useless wings. From its neck hung a brilliant wattle colored\nred, green, and purple.\n\n\"It is dangerous?\" Cable asked.\n\nSorensen nodded. \"Natives on New Guinea have been kicked to death by\nthose birds.\"\n\n\"Why haven't we seen it before?\" Cable asked.\n\n\"They're usually very shy,\" Sorensen said. \"They stay as far from\npeople as they can.\"\n\n\"This one sure isn't shy,\" Cable said, as the cassowary took a step\ntoward them. \"Can we run?\"\n\n\"The bird can run a lot faster,\" Sorensen said. \"I don't suppose you\nhave a gun with you?\"\n\n\"Of course not. There's been nothing to shoot.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBacking away, they held their spades like spears. The brush crackled\nand an anteater emerged. It was followed by a wild pig. The three\nbeasts converged on the men, backing them toward the dense wall of the\njungle.\n\n\"They're herding us,\" Cable said, his voice going shrill.\n\n\"Take it easy,\" Sorensen said. \"The cassowary is the only one we have\nto watch out for.\"\n\n\"Aren't anteaters dangerous?\"\n\n\"Only to ants.\"\n\n\"The hell you say,\" Cable said. \"Bill, the animals on this island have\ngone crazy. Remember Eakins' mouse?\"\n\n\"I remember it,\" Sorensen said. They had reached the far edge of the\nclearing. The beasts were in front of them, still advancing, with the\ncassowary in the center. Behind them lay the jungle--and whatever they\nwere being herded toward.\n\n\"We'll have to make a break for it,\" Sorensen said.\n\n\"That damned bird is blocking the trail.\"\n\n\"We'll have to knock him over,\" Sorensen said. \"Watch out for his feet.\nLet's go!\"\n\nThey raced toward the cassowary, swinging their spades. The cassowary\nhesitated, unable to make up its mind between targets. Then it turned\ntoward Cable and its right leg lashed out. The partially deflected blow\nsounded like the flat of a meat cleaver against a side of beef. Cable\ngrunted and collapsed, clutching his ribs.\n\nSorensen stabbed, and the honed edge of his spade nearly severed the\ncassowary's head from its body. The wild pig and the anteater were\ncoming at him now. He flailed with his spade, driving them back. Then,\nwith a strength he hadn't known he possessed, he stooped, lifted Cable\nacross his shoulders and ran down the path.\n\nA quarter of a mile down he had to stop, completely out of breath.\nThere were no sounds behind him. The other animals were apparently not\nfollowing. He went back to the wounded man.\n\nCable had begun to recover consciousness. He was able to walk,\nhalf-supported by Sorensen. When they reached the camp, Sorensen called\neverybody in for a meeting. He counted heads while Eakins taped up\nCable's side. Only one man was missing.\n\n\"Where's Drake?\" Sorensen asked.\n\n\"He's across the island at North Beach, fishing,\" said Tom Recetich.\n\"Want me to get him?\"\n\nSorensen hesitated. Finally he said, \"No. I'd better explain what\nwe're up against. Then we'll issue the guns. _Then_ we'll try to find\nDrake.\"\n\n\"Man, what's going on?\" Recetich asked.\n\nSorensen began to explain what had happened at Site 4.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFishing provided an important part of the expedition's food and there\nwas no work Drake liked better. At first he had gone out with face\nmask and spear gun. But the sharks in this corner of the world were\nnumerous, hungry and aggressive. So, regretfully, he had given up skin\ndiving and set out handlines on the leeward side of the island.\n\nThe lines were out now, and Drake lay in the shade of a palm tree,\nhalf asleep, his big forearms folded over his chest. His dog, Oro, was\nprowling the beach in search of hermit crabs. Oro was a good-natured\nmutt, part airdale, part terrier, part unknown. He was growling at\nsomething now.\n\n\"Leave the crabs alone,\" Drake called out. \"You'll just get nipped\nagain.\"\n\nOro was still growling. Drake rolled over and saw that the dog was\nstanding stiff-legged over a large insect. It looked like some kind of\nscorpion.\n\n\"Oro, leave that blasted--\"\n\nBefore Drake could move, the insect sprang. It landed on Oro's neck and\nthe jointed tail whipped out. Oro yelped once. Drake was on his feet\ninstantly. He swatted at the bug, but it jumped off the dog's neck and\nscuttled into the brush.\n\n\"Take it easy, old boy,\" Drake said. \"That's a nasty-looking wound.\nMight be poisoned. I better open it up.\"\n\nHe held the panting dog firmly and drew his boat knife. He had operated\non the dog for snake bite in Central America, and in the Adirondacks\nhe had held him down and pulled porcupine quills out of his mouth with\na pair of pliers. The dog always knew he was being helped. He never\nstruggled.\n\nThis time, the dog bit.\n\n\"Oro!\" Drake grabbed the dog at the jaw hinge with his free hand. He\nbrought pressure to bear, paralyzing the muscles, forcing the dog's\njaws open. He pulled his hand out and flung the dog away. Oro rolled to\nhis feet and advanced on him again.\n\n\"Stand!\" Drake shouted. The dog kept coming, edging around to get\nbetween the ocean and the man.\n\nTurning, Drake saw the bug emerge from the jungle and creep toward him.\nHis dog had circled around and was trying to drive him toward the bug.\n\nDrake didn't know what was going on, and he decided he'd better not\nstay to find out. He picked up his knife and threw it at the bug. He\nmissed. The bug was almost within jumping distance.\n\nDrake ran toward the ocean. When Oro tried to intercept him, he kicked\nthe dog out of the way and plunged into the water.\n\nHe began to swim around the island to the camp, hoping he'd make it\nbefore the sharks got him.\n\n\nIII\n\nAt the camp, rifles and revolvers were hastily wiped clean of cosmoline\nand passed around. Binoculars were taken out and adjusted. Cartridges\nwere divided up, and the supply of knives, machetes and hatchets\nquickly disappeared. The expedition's two walkie-talkies were unpacked,\nand the men prepared to move out in search of Drake. Then they saw him,\nswimming vigorously around the edge of the island.\n\nHe waded ashore, tired but uninjured. He and the others put their\ninformation together and reached some unhappy conclusions.\n\n\"Do you mean to say,\" Cable demanded, \"that a _bug_ is doing all this?\"\n\n\"It looks that way,\" Sorensen said. \"We have to assume that it's able\nto exercise some kind of thought control. Maybe hypnotic or telepathic.\"\n\n\"It has to sting first,\" Drake said. \"That's what it did with Oro.\"\n\n\"I just can't imagine a scorpion doing all that,\" Recetich said.\n\n\"It's not a scorpion,\" Drake said. \"I saw it close up. It's got a tail\nlike a scorpion, but its head is damn near four times as big, and its\nbody is different. Up close, it doesn't look like anything you ever saw\nbefore.\"\n\n\"Do you think it's native to this island?\" asked Monty Byrnes, a\ntreasure-seeker from Indianapolis.\n\n\"I doubt it,\" Drake said. \"If it is, why did it leave us and the\nanimals alone for three months?\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Sorensen said. \"All our troubles began just after the\nschooner came. The schooner must have brought it from somewhere....\nHey!\"\n\n\"What is it?\" Drake asked.\n\n\"Remember that scorpion the skipper tried to squash? It came out of the\ndetector crate. Do you think it could be the same one?\"\n\nDrake shrugged his shoulders. \"Could be. Seems to me our problem right\nnow isn't finding out where it came from. We have to figure out what to\ndo about it.\"\n\n\"If it can control animals,\" Byrnes said, \"I wonder if it can control\nmen.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey were all silent. They had moved into a circle near the copra shed,\nand while they talked they watched the jungle for any sign of insect or\nanimal life.\n\nSorensen said, \"We'd better radio for help.\"\n\n\"If we do that,\" Recetich said, \"somebody's going to find out about the\n_Santa Teresa_ treasure. We'll be overrun in no time.\"\n\n\"Maybe so,\" Sorensen said. \"But at the worst, we've cleared expenses.\nWe've even made a small profit.\"\n\n\"And if we don't get help,\" Drake said, \"we may be in no condition to\ntake anything out of here.\"\n\n\"The problem isn't as bad as all that,\" Byrnes said. \"We've got guns.\nWe can take care of the animals.\"\n\n\"You haven't seen the bug yet,\" Drake said.\n\n\"We'll squash it.\"\n\n\"That won't be easy,\" Drake said. \"It's faster than hell. And how are\nyou going to squash it if it comes into your hut some night while\nyou're asleep? We could post guards and they wouldn't even see the\nthing.\"\n\nBrynes shuddered involuntarily. \"Yeah, I guess you're right. Maybe we'd\nbetter radio for help.\"\n\nEakins stood up. \"Well, gents,\" he said, \"I guess that means me. I just\nhope the batteries on the ketch are up to charge.\"\n\n\"It'll be dangerous going out there,\" Drake said. \"We'll draw lots.\"\n\nEakins was amused. \"We will? How many of you can operate a transmitter?\"\n\nDrake said, \"I can.\"\n\n\"No offense meant,\" Eakins said, \"but you don't operate that set of\nyours worth a damn. You don't even know Morse for key transmission. And\ncan you fix the set if it goes out?\"\n\n\"No,\" Drake said. \"But the whole thing is too risky. We all should go.\"\n\nEakins shook his head. \"Safest thing all around is if you cover me from\nthe beach. That bug probably hasn't thought about the ketch yet.\"\n\nEakins stuck a tool kit in his pocket and strapped one of the camp's\nwalkie-talkies over his shoulder. He handed the other one to Sorensen.\nHe hurried down the beach past the launch and pushed the small dinghy\ninto the water. The men of the expedition spread out, their rifles\nready. Eakins got into the dinghy and started rowing across the quiet\nlagoon.\n\nThey saw him tie up to the ketch and pause a moment, looking around.\nThen he climbed aboard. Quickly he slid back the hatch and went inside.\n\n\"Everything all right?\" Sorensen asked.\n\n\"No trouble yet,\" Eakins said, his voice sounding thin and sharp over\nthe walkie-talkie. \"I'm at the transmitter now, turning it on. It needs\na couple of minutes to warm up.\"\n\nDrake nudged Sorensen. \"Look over there.\"\n\nOn the reef, almost hidden by the ketch, something was moving. Using\nbinoculars, Sorensen could see three big gray rats slipping into the\nwater. They began swimming toward the ketch.\n\n\"Start firing!\" Sorensen said. \"Eakins, get out of there!\"\n\n\"I've got the transmitter going,\" Eakins said. \"I just need a couple of\nminutes more to get a message off.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBullets sent up white splashes around the swimming rats. One was hit;\nthe other two managed to put the ketch between them and the riflemen.\nStudying the reef with his binoculars, Sorensen saw an anteater cross\nthe reef and splash into the water. It was followed by a wild pig.\n\nThere was a crackle of static from the walkie-talkie. Sorensen called,\n\"Eakins, have you got that message off?\"\n\n\"Haven't sent it,\" Eakins called back. \"Listen, Bill. We _mustn't_ send\nany messages! That bug wants--\" He stopped abruptly.\n\n\"What is it?\" Sorensen asked. \"What's happening?\"\n\nEakins had appeared on deck, still holding the walkie-talkie. He was\nbacking toward the stern.\n\n\"Hermit crabs,\" he said. \"They climbed up the anchor line. I'm going to\nswim to shore.\"\n\n\"Don't do it,\" Sorensen said.\n\n\"Gotta do it,\" Eakins said. \"They'll probably follow me. All of you\ncome out here and _get that transmitter_. Bring it ashore.\"\n\nThrough his binoculars, Sorensen could see a solid gray carpet of\nhermit crabs crawling down the deck and waterways of the ketch. Eakins\njumped into the water. He swam furiously toward shore, and Sorensen saw\nthe rats turn and follow him. Hermit crabs swarmed off the boat, and\nthe wild pig and the anteater paddled after him, trying to head him off\nbefore he reached the beach.\n\n\"Come on,\" Sorensen said. \"I don't know what Eakins figured out, but we\nbetter get that transmitter while we have a chance.\"\n\nThey ran down the beach and put the launch into the water. Two hundred\nyards away, Eakins had reached the far edge of the beach with the\nanimals in close pursuit. He broke into the jungle, still clinging to\nhis walkie-talkie.\n\n\"Eakins?\" Sorensen asked into the walkie-talkie.\n\n\"I'm all right,\" Eakins said, panting hard for air. \"Get that\ntransmitter, and don't forget the batteries!\"\n\nThe men boarded the ketch. Working furiously, they ripped the\ntransmitter off its bulkhead and dragged it up the companionway steps.\nDrake came last, carrying a twelve-volt battery. He went down again and\nbrought up a second battery. He hesitated a moment, then went below for\na third time.\n\n\"Drake!\" Sorensen shouted. \"Quit holding us up!\"\n\nDrake reappeared, carrying the ketch's two radio direction finders and\nthe compass. He handed them down and jumped into the launch.\n\n\"OK,\" he said. \"Let's go.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey rowed to the beach. Sorensen was trying to re-establish contact\nwith Eakins on the walkie-talkie, but all he could hear was static.\nThen, as the launch grounded on the beach, he heard Eakins' voice.\n\n\"I'm surrounded,\" he said, very quietly. \"I guess I'll have to see what\nMr. Bug wants. Maybe I can swat him first, though.\"\n\nThere was a long silence. Then Eakins said, \"It's coming toward me now.\nDrake was right. It sure isn't like any bug _I've_ ever seen. I'm going\nto swat hell out of--\"\n\nThey heard him scream, more in surprise than pain.\n\nSorensen said, \"Eakins, can you hear me? Where are you? Can we help?\"\n\n\"It sure _is_ fast,\" Eakins said, his voice conversational again.\n\"Fastest damned bug I've ever seen. Jumped on my neck, stung me and\njumped off again.\"\n\n\"How do you feel?\" Sorensen asked.\n\n\"Fine,\" Eakins said. \"Hardly felt the sting.\"\n\n\"Where is the bug now?\"\n\n\"Back in the bush.\"\n\n\"The animals?\"\n\n\"They went away. You know,\" Eakins said, \"maybe this thing doesn't\nwork on humans. Maybe--\"\n\n\"What?\" Sorensen asked. \"What's happening now?\"\n\nThere was a long silence. Then Eakins' voice, low-pitched and calm,\ncame over the walkie-talkie.\n\n\"We'll speak with you again later,\" Eakins said. \"We must take\nconsultation now and decide what to do with you.\"\n\n\"_Eakins!_\"\n\nThere was no answer from the other end of the walkie-talkie.\n\n\nIV\n\nReturning to their camp, the men were in a mood of thorough depression.\nThey couldn't understand what had happened to Eakins and they didn't\nfeel like speculating on it. The ravaging afternoon sun beat down,\nreflecting heat back from the white sand. The damp jungle steamed, and\nappeared to creep toward them like a huge and sleepy green dragon,\ntrapping them against the indifferent sea. Gun barrels grew too hot to\ntouch, and the water in the canteens was as warm as blood. Overhead,\nthick gray cumulus clouds began to pile up; it was the beginning of the\nmonsoon season.\n\nDrake sat in the shade of the copra shed. He shook off his lethargy\nlong enough to inspect the camp from the viewpoint of defense. He saw\nthe encircling jungle as enemy territory. In front of it was an area\nfifty yards deep which they had cleared. This no man's land could\nperhaps be defended for a while.\n\nThen came the huts and the copra shed, their last line of defense,\nleading to the beach and the sea.\n\nThe expedition had been in complete control of this island for better\nthan three months. Now they were pinned to a small and precarious\nbeachhead.\n\nDrake glanced at the lagoon behind him and remembered that there was\nstill one line of retreat open. If the bug and his damned menagerie\npressed too hard, they could still escape in the ketch. With luck.\n\nSorensen came over and sat down beside him. \"What are you doing?\" he\nasked.\n\nDrake grinned sourly. \"Planning our master strategy.\"\n\n\"How does it look?\"\n\n\"I think we can hold out,\" Drake said. \"We've got plenty of ammo. If\nnecessary, we'll interdict the cleared area with gasoline. We certainly\naren't going to let that bug push us off the island.\" He thought for a\nmoment. \"But it's going to be damned hard digging for treasure.\"\n\nSorensen nodded. \"I wonder what the bug wants.\"\n\n\"Maybe we'll find out from Eakins,\" Drake said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey had to wait half an hour. Then Eakins' voice came, sharp and\nshrill over the walkie-talkie.\n\n\"Sorensen? Drake?\"\n\n\"We're here,\" Drake said. \"What did that damned bug do to you?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" Eakins said. \"You are talking to that bug now. My name is\nthe Quedak.\"\n\n\"My God,\" Drake said to Sorensen, \"that bug must have hypnotized him!\"\n\n\"No. You are not speaking to a hypnotized Eakins. Nor are you speaking\nto a creature who is simply using Eakins as a mouthpiece. Nor are you\nspeaking to the Eakins who was. You are speaking to many individuals\nwho are one.\"\n\n\"I don't get that,\" Drake said.\n\n\"It's very simple,\" Eakins' voice replied. \"I am the Quedak, the\ntotality. But my totality is made up of separate parts, which\nare Eakins, several rats, a dog named Oro, a pig, an anteater, a\ncassowary--\"\n\n\"Hold on,\" Sorensen said. \"Let me get this straight. This is _not_\nEakins I'm speaking to. This is the--the Quedak?\"\n\n\"That is correct.\"\n\n\"And you control Eakins and the others? You speak through Eakins'\nmouth?\"\n\n\"Also correct. But that doesn't mean that the personalities of\nthe others are obliterated. Quite the contrary, the Quedak state\nis a federation in which the various member parts retain their\nidiosyncrasies, their individual needs and desires. They give their\nknowledge, their power, their special outlook to the Quedak whole. The\nQuedak is the coordinating and command center; but the individual parts\nsupply the knowledge, the insights, the special skills. And together we\nform the Great Cooperation.\"\n\n\"Cooperation?\" Drake said. \"But you did all this by force!\"\n\n\"It was necessary in the beginning. Otherwise, how would other\ncreatures have known about the Great Cooperation?\"\n\n\"Would they stay if you released your control over them?\" Drake asked.\n\n\"That is a meaningless question. We form a single indivisible entity\nnow. Would your arm return to you if you cut it off?\"\n\n\"It isn't the same thing.\"\n\n\"It is,\" Eakins' voice said. \"We are a single organism. We are still\ngrowing. And we welcome you wholeheartedly into the Great Cooperation.\"\n\n\"To hell with that,\" Drake said.\n\n\"But you must join,\" the Quedak told them. \"It is the Quedak Mission to\ncoordinate all sentient creatures into a single collective organism.\nBelieve me, there is only the most trifling loss of the individuality\nyou prize so highly. And you gain so much more! You learn the\nviewpoints and special knowledge of all other creatures. Within the\nQuedak framework you can fully realize your potentialities--\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"I am sorry,\" the Quedak said. \"The Quedak Mission must be fulfilled.\nYou will not join us willingly?\"\n\n\"Never,\" Drake said.\n\n\"Then _we_ will join _you_,\" the Quedak said.\n\nThere was a click as he turned off the walkie-talkie.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFrom the fringe of the jungle, several rats appeared. They hesitated,\njust out of rifle range. A bird of paradise flew overhead, hovering\nover the cleared area like an observation plane. As the men watched,\nthe rats began to run forward in long zigzags.\n\n\"Start firing,\" Drake called out. \"But go easy with the ammo.\"\n\nThe men began to fire. But it was difficult to sight on the\nquick-moving rats against the grayish-brown clearing. And almost\nimmediately, the rats were joined by a dozen hermit crabs. They had\nan uncanny knack for moving when no one was watching them, darting\nforward, then freezing against the neutral background.\n\nThey saw Eakins appear on the fringe of the jungle.\n\n\"Lousy traitor,\" Cable said, raising his rifle.\n\nSorensen slapped the muzzle of the rifle aside. \"Don't do it.\"\n\n\"But he's helping that bug!\"\n\n\"He can't help it,\" Sorensen said. \"And he's not armed. Leave him\nalone.\"\n\nEakins watched for a few moments, then melted back into the jungle.\n\nThe attack by the rats and crabs swept across half of the cleared\nspace. Then, as they came closer, the men were able to pick their\ntargets with more accuracy. Nothing was able to get closer than twenty\nyards. And when Recetich shot down the bird of paradise, the attack\nbegan to falter.\n\n\"You know,\" Drake said, \"I think we're going to be all right.\"\n\n\"Could be,\" said Sorensen. \"I don't understand what the Quedak is\ntrying to accomplish. He knows we can't be taken like this. I should\nthink--\"\n\n\"Hey!\" one of the men called out. \"Our boat!\"\n\nThey turned and saw why the Quedak had ordered the attack. While it\nhad occupied their attention, Drake's dog had swum out to the ketch\nand gnawed through the anchor line. Unattended, the ketch was drifting\nbefore the wind, moving toward the reef. They saw it bump gently, then\nharder. In a moment it was heeled hard over, stuck in the coral.\n\nThere was a burst of static from the walkie-talkie. Sorensen held it\nup and heard the Quedak say, \"The ketch isn't seriously damaged. It's\nsimply immobilized.\"\n\n\"The hell you say,\" Drake growled. \"For all you know, it's got a hole\npunched right through it. How do you plan on getting off the island,\nQuedak? Or are you just going to stay here?\"\n\n\"I will leave at the proper time,\" the Quedak said. \"I want to make\nsure that we all leave together.\"\n\n\nV\n\nThe wind died. Huge gray thunderheads piled up in the sky to the\nsoutheast, their tops lost in the upper atmosphere, their black anvil\nbottoms pressing the hot still air upon the island. The sun had lost\nits fiery glare. Cherry-red, it slid listlessly toward the flat sea.\n\nHigh overhead, a single bird of paradise circled, just out of rifle\nrange. It had gone up ten minutes after Recetich had shot the first one\ndown.\n\nMonty Byrnes stood on the edge of the cleared area, his rifle ready.\nHe had drawn the first guard shift. The rest of the men were eating a\nhasty dinner inside the copra shed. Sorensen and Drake were outside,\nlooking over the situation.\n\nDrake said, \"By nightfall we'll have to pull everybody back into the\nshed. Can't take a chance on being exposed to the Quedak in the dark.\"\n\nSorensen nodded. He seemed to have aged ten years in a day's time.\n\n\"In the morning,\" Drake said, \"we'll be able to work something out\nWe'll.... What's wrong, Bill?\"\n\n\"Do you really think we have a chance?\" Sorensen asked.\n\n\"Sure we do. We've got a damned good chance.\"\n\n\"Be realistic,\" Sorensen said. \"The longer this goes on, the more\nanimals the Quedak can throw against us. What can we do about it?\"\n\n\"Hunt him out and kill him.\"\n\n\"The damned thing is about the size of your thumb,\" Sorensen said\nirritably. \"How can we hunt him?\"\n\n\"We'll figure out something,\" Drake said. He was beginning to get\nworried about Sorensen. The morale among the men was low enough without\nSorensen pushing it down further.\n\n\"I wish someone would shoot that damned bird,\" Sorensen said, glancing\noverhead.\n\nAbout every fifteen minutes, the bird of paradise came darting down for\na closer look at the camp. Then, before the guard had a chance to fire,\nhe swept back up to a safe altitude.\n\n\"It's getting on my nerves, too,\" Drake said. \"Maybe that's what it's\nsupposed to do. One of these times we'll--\"\n\nHe stopped abruptly. From the copra shed he could hear the loud hum of\na radio. And he heard Al Cable saying, \"Hello, hello, this is Vuanu\ncalling. We need help.\"\n\nDrake and Sorensen went into the shed. Cable was sitting in front of\nthe transmitter, saying into the microphone, \"Emergency, emergency,\nVuanu calling, we need--\"\n\n\"What in hell do you think you're doing?\" Drake snapped.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCable turned and looked at him, his pudgy pink body streaked with\nsweat. \"I'm radioing for help, that's what I'm doing. I think I've\npicked up somebody. But they haven't answered me yet.\"\n\nHe readjusted the tuning. Over the receiver, they could hear a bored\nBritish voice saying, \"Pawn to Queen four, eh? Why don't you ever try a\ndifferent opening?\"\n\nThere was a sharp burst of static. \"Just move,\" a deep bass voice\nanswered. \"Just shut up and move.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said the British voice. \"Knight to king bishop three.\"\n\nDrake recognized the voices. They were ham radio operators. One of\nthem owned a plantation on Bougainville; the other was a shopkeeper in\nRabaul. They came on the air for an hour of chess and argument every\nevening.\n\nCable tapped the microphone impatiently. \"Hello,\" he said, \"this is\nVuanu calling, emergency call--\"\n\nDrake walked over and took the microphone out of Cable's hand. He put\nit down carefully.\n\n\"We can't call for help,\" he said.\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" Cable cried. \"We have to!\"\n\nDrake felt very tired. \"Look, if we send out a distress call,\nsomebody's going to come sailing right in--but they won't be prepared\nfor this kind of trouble. The Quedak will take them over and then use\nthem against us.\"\n\n\"We can explain what the trouble is,\" Cable said.\n\n\"_Explain?_ Explain _what_? That a bug is taking over the island?\nThey'd think we were crazy with fever. They'd send in a doctor on the\ninter-island schooner.\"\n\n\"Dan's right,\" Sorensen said. \"Nobody would believe this without seeing\nit for himself.\"\n\n\"And by then,\" Drake said, \"it'd be too late. Eakins figured it out\nbefore the Quedak got him. That's why he told us not to send any\nmessages.\"\n\nCable looked dubious. \"But why did he want us to take the transmitter?\"\n\n\"So that _he_ couldn't send any messages after the bug got him,\" Drake\nsaid. \"The more people trampling around, the easier it would be for the\nQuedak. If he had possession of the transmitter, he'd be calling for\nhelp right now.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I suppose so,\" Cable said unhappily. \"But, damn it, we can't\nhandle this _alone_.\"\n\n\"We have to. If the Quedak ever gets us and then gets off the island,\nthat's it for Earth. Period. There won't be any big war, no hydrogen\nbombs or fallout, no heroic little resistance groups. Everybody will\nbecome part of the Quedak Cooperation.\"\n\n\"We ought to get help somehow,\" Cable said stubbornly. \"We're alone,\nisolated. Suppose we ask for a ship to stand offshore--\"\n\n\"It won't work,\" Drake said. \"Besides, we couldn't ask for help even if\nwe wanted to.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because the transmitter's not working,\" Drake said. \"You've been\ntalking into a dead mike.\"\n\n\"It's receiving OK,\" Cable said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDrake checked to see if all the switches were on. \"Nothing wrong with\nthe receiver. But we must have joggled something taking the transmitter\nout of the ship. It isn't working.\"\n\nCable tapped the dead microphone several times, then put it down. They\nstood around the receiver, listening to the chess game between the man\nin Rabaul and the man in Bougainville.\n\n\"Pawn to queen bishop four.\"\n\n\"Pawn to king three.\"\n\n\"Knight to Queen bishop three.\"\n\nThere was a sudden staccato burst of static. It faded, then came again\nin three distinct bursts.\n\n\"What do you suppose that is?\" Sorensen asked.\n\nDrake shrugged his shoulders. \"Could be anything. Storm's shaping up\nand--\"\n\nHe stopped. He had been standing beside the door of the shed. As the\nstatic crackled, he saw the bird of paradise dive for a closer look.\nThe static stopped when the bird returned to its slow-circling higher\naltitude.\n\n\"That's strange,\" Drake said. \"Did you see that, Bill? The bird came\ndown and the static went on at the same time.\"\n\n\"I saw it,\" Sorensen said. \"Think it means anything?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Let's see.\" Drake took out his field glasses. He turned\nup the volume of the receiver and stepped outside where he could\nobserve the jungle. He waited, hearing the sounds of the chess game\nthree or four hundred miles away.\n\n\"Come on now, move.\"\n\n\"Give me a minute.\"\n\n\"A minute? Listen, I can't stand in front of this bleeding set all\nnight. Make your--\"\n\nStatic crackled sharply. Drake saw four wild pigs come trotting out of\nthe jungle, moving slowly, like a reconnaissance squad probing for weak\nspots in an enemy position. They stopped; the static stopped. Byrnes,\nstanding guard with his rifle, took a snap shot at them. The pigs\nturned, and static crackled as they moved back into the jungle. There\nwas more static as the bird of paradise swept down for a look, then\nclimbed out of range. After that, the static stopped.\n\nDrake put down his binoculars and went back inside the shed. \"That must\nbe it,\" he said. \"The static is related to the Quedak. I think it comes\nwhen he's operating the animals.\"\n\n\"You mean he has come sort of radio control over them?\" Sorensen asked.\n\n\"Seems like it,\" Drake said. \"Either radio control or something\npropagated along a radio wavelength.\"\n\n\"If that's the case,\" Sorensen said, \"he's like a little radio station,\nisn't he?\"\n\n\"Sure he is. So what?\"\n\n\"Then we should be able to locate him on a radio direction finder,\"\nSorensen said.\n\nDrake nodded emphatically. He snapped off the receiver, went to a\ncorner of the shed and took out one of their portable direction\nfinders. He set it to the frequency at which Cable had picked up the\nRabaul-Bougainville broadcast. Then he turned it on and walked to the\ndoor.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe men watched while Drake rotated the loop antenna. He located the\nmaximum signal, then turned the loop slowly, read the bearing and\nconverted it to a compass course. Then he sat down with a small-scale\nchart of the Southwest Pacific.\n\n\"Well,\" Sorensen asked, \"is it the Quedak?\"\n\n\"It's got to be,\" said Drake. \"I located a good null almost due south.\nThat's straight ahead in the jungle.\"\n\n\"You're sure it isn't a reciprocal bearing?\"\n\n\"I checked that out.\"\n\n\"Is there any chance the signal comes from some other station?\"\n\n\"Nope. Due south, the next station is Sydney, and that's seventeen\nhundred miles away. Much too far for this RDF. It's the Quedak, all\nright.\"\n\n\"So we have a way of locating him,\" Sorensen said. \"Two men with\ndirection finders can go into the jungle--\"\n\n\"--and get themselves killed,\" Drake said. \"We can position the Quedak\nwith RDFs, but his animals can locate us a lot faster. We wouldn't have\na chance in the jungle.\"\n\nSorensen looked crestfallen. \"Then we're no better off than before.\"\n\n\"We're a lot better off,\" Drake said. \"We have a chance now.\"\n\n\"What makes you think so?\"\n\n\"He controls the animals by radio,\" Drake said. \"We know the frequency\nhe operates on. We can broadcast on the same frequency. We can jam his\nsignal.\"\n\n\"Are you sure about that?\"\n\n\"Am I _sure_? Of course not. But I do know that two stations in the\nsame area can't broadcast over the same frequency. If we tuned in\nto the frequency the Quedak uses, made enough noise to override his\nsignal--\"\n\n\"I see,\" Sorensen said. \"Maybe it would work! If we could interfere\nwith his signal, he wouldn't be able to control the animals. And then\nwe could hunt him down with the RDFs.\"\n\n\"That's the idea,\" Drake said. \"It has only one small flaw--our\ntransmitter isn't working. With no transmitter, we can't do any\nbroadcasting. No broadcasting, no jamming.\"\n\n\"Can you fix it?\" Sorensen asked.\n\n\"I'll try,\" Drake said. \"But we'd better not hope for too much. Eakins\nwas the radio man on this expedition.\"\n\n\"We've got all the spare parts,\" Sorensen said. \"Tubes, manual,\neverything.\"\n\n\"I know. Give me enough time and I'll figure out what's wrong. The\nquestion is, how much time is the Quedak going to give us?\"\n\nThe bright copper disk of the sun was half submerged in the sea. Sunset\ncolors touched the massing thunderheads and faded into the brief\ntropical twilight. The men began to barricade the copra shed for the\nnight.\n\n\nVI\n\nDrake removed the back from the transmitter and scowled at the compact\nmass of tubes and wiring. Those metal boxlike things were probably\ncondensers, and the waxy cylindrical gadgets might or might not be\nresistors. It all looked hopelessly complicated, ridiculously dense and\ndelicate. Where should he begin?\n\nHe turned on the set and waited a few minutes. All the tubes appeared\nto go on, some dim, some bright. He couldn't detect any loose wires.\nThe mike was still dead.\n\nSo much for visual inspection. Next question: was the set getting\nenough juice?\n\nHe turned it off and checked the battery cells with a voltmeter. The\nbatteries were up to charge. He removed the leads, scraped them and put\nthem back on, making sure they fit snugly. He checked all connections,\nmurmured a propitiatory prayer, and turned the set on.\n\nIt still didn't work.\n\nCursing, he turned it off again. He decided to replace all the tubes,\nstarting with the dim ones. If that didn't work, he could try replacing\ncondensers and resistors. If that didn't work, he could always shoot\nhimself. With this cheerful thought, he opened the parts kit and went\nto work.\n\nThe men were all inside the copra shed, finishing the job of\nbarricading it for the night. The door was wedged shut and locked. The\ntwo windows had to be kept open for ventilation; otherwise everyone\nwould suffocate in the heat. But a double layer of heavy mosquito\nnetting was nailed over each window, and a guard was posted beside it.\n\nNothing could get through the flat galvanized-iron roof. The floor was\nof pounded earth, a possible danger point. All they could do was keep\nwatch over it.\n\nThe treasure-hunters settled down for a long night. Drake, with a\nhandkerchief tied around his forehead to keep the perspiration out of\nhis eyes, continued working on the transmitter.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAn hour later, there was a buzz on the walkie-talkie. Sorensen picked\nit up and said, \"What do you want?\"\n\n\"I want you to end this senseless resistance,\" said the Quedak,\nspeaking with Eakins' voice. \"You've had enough time to think over the\nsituation. I want you to join me. Surely you can see there's no other\nway.\"\n\n\"We don't want to join you,\" Sorensen said.\n\n\"You must,\" the Quedak told him.\n\n\"Are you going to make us?\"\n\n\"That poses problems,\" the Quedak said. \"My animal parts are not\nsuitable for coercion. Eakins is an excellent mechanism, but there is\nonly one of him. And I must not expose myself to unnecessary danger.\nBy doing so I would endanger the Quedak Mission.\"\n\n\"So it's a stalemate,\" Sorensen said.\n\n\"No. I am faced with difficulty only in taking you over. There is no\nproblem in killing you.\"\n\nThe men shifted uneasily. Drake, working on the transmitter, didn't\nlook up.\n\n\"I would rather _not_ kill you,\" the Quedak said. \"But the Quedak\nMission is of primary importance. It would be endangered if you didn't\njoin. It would be seriously compromised if you left the island. So you\nmust either join or be killed.\"\n\n\"That's not the way I see it,\" Sorensen said. \"If you killed\nus--assuming that you can--you'd never get off this island. Eakins\ncan't handle that ketch.\"\n\n\"There would be no need to leave in the ketch,\" the Quedak said. \"In\nsix months, the inter-island schooner will return. Eakins and I will\nleave then. The rest of you will have died.\"\n\n\"You're bluffing,\" Sorensen said. \"What makes you think you could kill\nus? You didn't do so well today.\" He caught Drake's attention and\ngestured at the radio. Drake shrugged his shoulders and went back to\nwork.\n\n\"I wasn't trying,\" the Quedak said. \"The time for that was at night.\n_This_ night, before you have a chance to work out a better system of\ndefense. You must join me tonight or I will kill one of you.\"\n\n\"One of us?\"\n\n\"Yes. One man an hour. In that way, perhaps the survivors will change\ntheir minds about joining. But if they don't, all of you will be dead\nby morning.\"\n\nDrake leaned over and whispered to Sorensen, \"Stall him. Give me\nanother ten minutes. I think I've found the trouble.\"\n\nSorensen said into the walkie-talkie, \"We'd like to know a little more\nabout the Quedak Cooperation.\"\n\n\"You can find out best by joining.\"\n\n\"We'd rather have a little more information on it first.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"It is an indescribable state,\" the Quedak said in an urgent,\nearnest, eager voice. \"Can you imagine yourself as _yourself_ and yet\nexperiencing an entirely new series of sensory networks? You would, for\nexample, experience the world through the perceptors of a dog as he\ngoes through the forest following an odor which to him--and to you--is\nas clear and vivid as a painted line. A hermit crab senses things\ndifferently. From him you experience the slow interaction of life at\nthe margin of sea and land. His time-sense is very slow, unlike that\nof a bird of paradise, whose viewpoint is spatial, rapid, cursory.\nAnd there are many others, above and below the earth and water, who\nfurnish their own specialized viewpoints of reality. Their outlooks,\nI have found, are not essentially different from those of the animals\nthat once inhabited Mars.\"\n\n\"What happened on Mars?\" Sorensen asked.\n\n\"All life died,\" the Quedak mourned. \"All except the Quedak. It\nhappened a long time ago. For centuries there was peace and prosperity\non the planet. Everything and everyone was part of the Quedak\nCooperation. But the dominant race was basically weak. Their breeding\nrate went down; catastrophes happened. And finally there was no more\nlife except the Quedak.\"\n\n\"Sounds great,\" Sorensen said ironically.\n\n\"It was the fault of the race,\" the Quedak protested. \"With sturdier\nstock--such as you have on this planet--the will to live will remain\nintact. The peace and prosperity will continue indefinitely.\"\n\n\"I don't believe it. What happened on Mars will happen again on Earth\nif you take over. After a while, slaves just don't care very strongly\nabout living.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't be slaves. You would be functional parts of the Quedak\nCooperation.\"\n\n\"Which would be run by you,\" Sorensen said. \"Any way you slice it,\nit's the same old pie.\"\n\n\"You don't know what you're talking about,\" the Quedak said. \"We have\ntalked long enough. I am prepared to kill one man in the next five\nminutes. Are you or are you not going to join me?\" Sorensen looked at\nDrake. Drake turned on the transmitter.\n\nGusts of rain splattered on the roof while the transmitter warmed up.\nDrake lifted the microphone and tapped it, and was able to hear the\nsound in the speaker.\n\n\"It's working,\" he said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt that moment something flew against the netting-covered window. The\nnetting sagged; a fruit bat was entangled in it, glaring at them with\ntiny red-rimmed eyes.\n\n\"Get some boards over that window!\" Sorensen shouted.\n\nAs he spoke, a second bat hurtled into the netting, broke through it\nand tumbled to the floor. The men clubbed it to death, but four more\nbats flew in through the open window. Drake flailed at them, but he\ncouldn't drive them away from the transmitter. They were diving at his\neyes, and he was forced back. A wild blow caught one bat and knocked\nit to the floor with a broken wing. Then the others had reached the\ntransmitter.\n\nThey pushed it off the table. Drake tried to catch the set, and failed.\nHe heard the glass tubes shattering, but by then he was busy protecting\nhis eyes.\n\nIn a few minutes they had killed two more bats, and the others had fled\nout the window. The men nailed boards over both windows, and Drake bent\nto examine the transmitter.\n\n\"Any chance of fixing it?\" Sorensen asked.\n\n\"Not a hope,\" Drake said. \"They ripped out the wiring while they were\nat it.\"\n\n\"What do we do now?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\nThen the Quedak spoke to them over the walkie-talkie. \"I must have your\nanswer right now.\"\n\nNobody said a word.\n\n\"In that case,\" the Quedak said, \"I'm deeply sorry that one of you must\ndie now.\"\n\n\nVII\n\nRain pelted the iron roof and the gusts of wind increased in intensity.\nThere were rumbles of distant thunder. But within the copra shed, the\nair was hot and still. The gasoline lantern hanging from the center\nbeam threw a harsh yellow light that illuminated the center of the\nroom but left the corners in deep shadow. The treasure-hunters had\nmoved away from the walls. They were all in the center of the room\nfacing outward, and they made Drake think of a herd of buffalo drawn up\nagainst a wolf they could smell but could not see.\n\nCable said, \"Listen, maybe we should try this Quedak Cooperation. Maybe\nit isn't so bad as--\"\n\n\"Shut up,\" Drake said.\n\n\"Be reasonable,\" Cable argued. \"It's better than dying, isn't it?\"\n\n\"No one's dying yet,\" Drake said. \"Just shut up and keep your eyes\nopen.\"\n\n\"I think I'm going to be sick,\" Cable said. \"Dan, let me out.\"\n\n\"Be sick where you are,\" Drake said. \"Just keep your eyes open.\"\n\n\"You can't give me orders,\" Cable said. He started toward the door.\nThen he jumped back.\n\nA yellowish scorpion had crept under the inch of clearance between the\ndoor and the floor. Recetich stamped on it, smashing it to pulp under\nhis heavy boots. Then he whirled, swinging at three hornets which had\ncome at him through the boarded windows.\n\n\"Forget the hornets!\" Drake shouted. \"Keep watching the ground!\"\n\nThere was movement on the floor. Several hairy spiders crawled out of\nthe shadows. Drake and Recetich beat at them with rifle butts. Byrnes\nsaw something crawling under the door. It looked like some kind of huge\nflat centipede. He stamped at it, missed, and the centipede was on his\nboot, past it, on the flesh of his leg. He screamed; it felt like a\nribbon of molten metal. He was able to smash it flat before he passed\nout.\n\nDrake checked the wound and decided it was not fatal. He stamped on\nanother spider, then felt Sorensen's hand clutching his shoulder. He\nlooked toward the corner Sorensen was pointing at.\n\nSliding toward them were two large, dark-coated snakes. Drake\nrecognized them as black adders. These normally shy creatures were\ncoming forward like tigers.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe men panicked, trying to get away from the snakes. Drake pulled out\nhis revolver and dropped to one knee, ignoring the hornets that buzzed\naround him, trying to draw a bead on the slender serpentine targets in\nthe swaying yellow light.\n\nThunder roared directly overhead. A long flash of lightning suddenly\nflooded the room, spoiling his aim. Drake fired and missed, and waited\nfor the snakes to strike.\n\nThey didn't strike. They were moving away from him, retreating to the\nrat hole from which they had emerged. One of the adders slid quickly\nthrough. The other began to follow, then stopped, half in the hole.\n\nSorensen took careful aim with a rifle. Drake pushed the muzzle aside.\n\"Wait just a moment.\"\n\nThe adder hesitated. It came out of the hole and began to move toward\nthem again....\n\nAnd there was another crash of thunder and a vivid splash of lightning.\nThe snake turned away and squirmed through the hole.\n\n\"What's going on?\" Sorensen asked. \"Is the thunder frightening them?\"\n\n\"No, it's the lightning!\" Drake said. \"That's why the Quedak was in\nsuch a rush. He saw that a storm was coming, and he hadn't consolidated\nhis position yet.\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\"\n\n\"The lightning,\" Drake said.\n\n\"The electrical storm! It's jamming that radio control of his! And when\nhe's jammed, the beasts revert to normal behavior. It takes him time to\nre-establish control.\"\n\n\"The storm won't last forever,\" Cable said.\n\n\"But maybe it'll last long enough,\" Drake said. He picked up the\ndirection finders and handed one to Sorensen. \"Come on, Bill. We'll\nhunt out that bug right now.\"\n\n\"Hey,\" Recetich said, \"isn't there something I can do?\"\n\n\"You can start swimming if we don't come back in an hour,\" Drake said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn slanting lines the rain drove down, pushed by the wild southwest\nwind. Thunder rolled continually and each flash of lightning seemed\naimed at them. Drake and Sorensen reached the edge of the jungle and\nstopped.\n\n\"We'll separate here,\" Drake said. \"Gives us a better chance of\nconverging on him.\"\n\n\"Right,\" Sorensen said. \"Take care of yourself, Dan.\"\n\nSorensen plunged into the jungle. Drake trotted fifty yards down the\nfringe and then entered the bush.\n\nHe pushed forward, the revolver in his belt, the radio direction\nfinder in one hand, a flashlight in the other. The jungle seemed to\nbe animated by a vicious life of its own, almost as if the Quedak\ncontrolled it. Vines curled cunningly around his ankles and the bushes\nreached out thorny hands toward him. Every branch took a special\ndelight in slapping his face.\n\nEach time the lightning flashed, Drake's direction finder tried to\nhome on it. He was having a difficult time staying on course. But,\nhe reminded himself, the Quedak was undoubtedly having an even more\ndifficult time. Between flashes, he was able to set a course. The\nfurther he penetrated into the jungle, the stronger the signal became.\n\nAfter a while he noticed that the flashes of lightning were spaced\nmore widely apart. The storm was moving on toward the north, leaving\nthe island behind. How much longer would he have the protection of the\nlightning? Another ten or fifteen minutes?\n\nHe heard something whimper. He swung his flashlight around and saw his\ndog, Oro, coming toward him.\n\nHis dog--or the Quedak's dog?\n\n\"Hey there, boy,\" Drake said. He wondered if he should drop the\ndirection finder and get the revolver out of his belt. He wondered if\nthe revolver would still work after such a thorough soaking.\n\nOro came up and licked his hand. He was Drake's dog, at least for the\nduration of the storm.\n\nThey moved on together, and the thunder rumbled distantly in the north.\nThe signal on his RDF was very strong now. Somewhere around here....\n\nHe saw light from another flashlight. Sorensen, badly out of breath,\nhad joined him. The jungle had ripped and clawed at him, but he still\nhad his rifle, flashlight and direction finder.\n\nOro was scratching furiously at a bush. There was a long flash of\nlightning, and in it they saw the Quedak.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDrake realized, in those final moments, that the rain had stopped. The\nlightning had stopped, too. He dropped the direction finder. With the\nflashlight in one hand and his revolver in the other, he tried to take\naim at the Quedak, who was moving, who had jumped--\n\nTo Sorensen's neck, just above the right collarbone.\n\nSorensen raised his hands, then lowered them again. He turned toward\nDrake, raising his rifle. His face was perfectly calm. He looked as\nthough his only purpose in life was to kill Drake.\n\nDrake fired from less than two feet away. Sorensen spun with the\nimpact, dropped his rifle and fell.\n\nDrake bent over him, his revolver ready. He saw that he had fired\naccurately. The bullet had gone in just above the right collarbone. It\nwas a bad wound. But it had been much worse for the Quedak, who had\nbeen in the direct path of the bullet. All that was left of the Quedak\nwas a splatter of black across Sorensen's chest.\n\nDrake applied hasty first aid and hoisted Sorensen to his shoulders. He\nwondered what he would have done if the Quedak had been standing above\nSorensen's heart, or on his throat, or on his head.\n\nHe decided it was better not to think about that.\n\nHe started back to camp, with his dog trotting along beside him.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Meeting of the Minds, by Robert Sheckley\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MEETING OF THE MINDS ***\n\n***** This file should be named 51833.txt or 51833.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/1/8/3/51833/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations.

The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
