One man could eat the\n     native fruit and live ... but how?_\n\n\n\"And that,\" said Colonel Fennister glumly, \"appears to be that.\"\n\nThe pile of glowing coals that had been Storage Shed Number One was\nstill sending up tongues of flame, but they were nothing compared with\nwhat they'd been half an hour before.\n\n\"The smoke smells good, anyway,\" said Major Grodski, sniffing\nappreciatively.\n\nThe colonel turned his head and glowered at his adjutant.\n\n\"There are times, Grodski, when your sense of humor is out of place.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said the major, still sniffing. \"Funny thing for lightning\nto do, though. Sort of a dirty trick, you might say.\"\n\n\"_You_ might,\" growled the colonel. He was a short, rather roundish man,\nwho was forever thankful that the Twentieth Century predictions of\nskin-tight uniforms for the Space Service had never come true. He had\nround, pleasant, blue eyes, a rather largish nose, and a rumbling basso\nvoice that was a little surprising the first time you heard it, but\nwhich seemed to fit perfectly after you knew him better.\n\nRight at the moment, he was filing data and recommendations in his\nmemory, where they would be instantly available for use when he needed\nthem. Not in a physical file, but in his own mind.\n\n_All right, Colonel Fennister_, he thought to himself, _just what does\nthis mean--to me? And to the rest?_\n\nThe Space Service was not old. Unlike the Air Service, the Land Service,\nor the Sea Service, it did not have centuries or tradition behind it.\nBut it had something else. It had something that none of the other\nServices had--_Potential_.\n\nIn his own mind, Colonel Fennister spelled the word with an upper case\n_P_, and put the word in italics. It was, to him, a more potent word\nthan any other in the Universe.\n\nPotential.\n\n_Potential!_\n\n[Illustration]\n\nBecause the Space Service of the United Earth had more potential than\nany other Service on Earth. How many seas were there for the Sea Service\nto sail? How much land could the Land Service march over? How many\natmospheres were there for the Air Service to conquer?\n\nNot for any of those questions was there an accurate answer, but for\neach of those questions, the answer had a limit. But how much space was\nthere for the Space Service to conquer?\n\nColonel Fennister was not a proud man. He was not an arrogant man. But\nhe _did_ have a sense of destiny; he _did_ have a feeling that the human\nrace was going somewhere, and he did not intend that that feeling should\nbecome totally lost to humanity.\n\nPotential.\n\nDefinition: _Potential; that which has a possibility of coming into\nexistence._\n\nNo, more than that. That which has a--\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe jerked his mind away suddenly from the thoughts which had crowded\ninto his forebrain.\n\nWhat were the chances that the first expedition to Alphegar IV would\nsucceed? What were the chances that it would fail?\n\nAnd (Fennister grinned grimly to himself) what good did it do to\ncalculate chances after the event had happened?\n\nSurrounding the compound had been a double-ply, heavy-gauge, woven\nfence. It was guaranteed to be able to stop a diplodocus in full charge;\nthe electric potential (_potential!_ That word again!) great enough to\ncarbonize anything smaller than a blue whale. No animal on Alphegar IV\ncould possibly get through it.\n\nAnd none had.\n\nTrouble was, no one had thought of being attacked by something immensely\ngreater than a blue whale, especially since there was no animal larger\nthan a small rhino on the whole planet. Who, after all, could have\nexpected an attack by a blind, uncaring colossus--a monster that had\nalready been dying before it made its attack?\n\nBecause no one had thought of the forest.\n\nThe fact that the atmospheric potential--the voltage and even the\namperage difference between the low-hanging clouds and the ground\nbelow--was immensely greater than that of Earth, that had already been\ndetermined. But the compound and the defenses surrounding it had already\nbeen compensated for that factor.\n\nWho could have thought that a single lightning stroke through one of the\ntremendous, twelve-hundred-foot trees that surrounded the compound could\nhave felled it? Who could have predicted that it would topple toward the\ncompound itself?\n\nThat it would have been burning--that was something that could have been\nguaranteed, had the idea of the original toppling been considered.\nEspecially after the gigantic wooden life-thing had smashed across the\ndouble-ply fence, thereby adding man-made energy to its already\npowerful bulk and blazing surface.\n\nBut--that it would have fallen across Storage Shed Number One? Was\n_that_ predictable?\n\nFennister shook his head slowly. No. It wasn't. The accident was simply\nthat--an accident. No one was to blame; no one was responsible.\n\nExcept Fennister. _He_ was responsible. Not for the accident, but for\nthe personnel of the expedition. He was the Military Officer; he was the\nMan In Charge of Fending Off Attack.\n\nAnd he had failed.\n\nBecause that huge, blazing, stricken tree had toppled majestically down\nfrom the sky, crashing through its smaller brethren, to come to rest on\nStorage Shed Number One, thereby totally destroying the majority of the\nfood supply.\n\nThere were eighty-five men on Alphegar IV, and they would have to wait\nanother six months before the relief ship came.\n\nAnd they didn't have food enough to make it, now that their reserve had\nbeen destroyed.\n\nFennister growled something under his breath.\n\n\"What?\" asked Major Grodski, rather surprised at his superior's tone.\n\n\"I said: 'Water, water, everywhere--', that's what I said.\"\n\nMajor Grodski looked around him at the lush forest which surrounded the\ndouble-ply fence of the compound.\n\n\"Yeah,\" he said. \"'Nor any drop to drink.' But I wish one of those\nboards had shrunk--say, maybe, a couple hundred feet.\"\n\n\"I'm going back to my quarters,\" Fennister said. \"I'll be checking with\nthe civilian personnel. Let me know the total damage, will you?\"\n\nThe major nodded. \"I'll let you know, sir. Don't expect good news.\"\n\n\"I won't,\" said Colonel Fennister, as he turned.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe colonel let his plump bulk sag forward in his chair, and he covered\nhis hands with his eyes. \"I can imagine all kinds of catastrophes,\" he\nsaid, with a kind of hysterical glumness, \"but this has them all beat.\"\n\nDr. Pilar stroked his, short, gray, carefully cultivated beard. \"I'm\nafraid I don't understand. We could all have been killed.\"\n\nThe colonel peeked one out from between the first and second fingers of\nhis right hand. \"You think starving to death is cleaner than fire?\"\n\nPilar shook his head slowly. \"Of course not. I'm just not certain that\nwe'll all die--that's all.\"\n\nColonel Fennister dropped his hands to the surface of his metal desk. \"I\nsee,\" he said dryly. \"Where there's life, there's hope. Right? All\nright, I agree with you.\" He waved his hand around, in an\nall-encompassing gesture. \"Somewhere out there, we may find food. But\ndon't you see that this puts us in the Siege Position?\"\n\nDr. Francis Pilar frowned. His thick salt-and-pepper brows rumpled in a\nlook of puzzlement. \"Siege Position? I'm afraid--\"\n\nFennister gestured with one hand and leaned back in his chair, looking\nat the scientist across from him. \"I'm sorry,\" he said. \"I've let my\nhumiliation get the better of me.\" He clipped his upper lip between his\nteeth until his lower incisors were brushed by his crisp, military\nmustache, and held it there for a moment before he spoke.\n\n\"The Siege Position is one that no military commander of any cerebral\nmagnitude whatever allows himself to get into. It is as old as Mankind,\nand a great deal stupider. It is the position of a beleaguered group\nwhich lacks one simple essential to keep them alive until help comes.\n\n\"A fighting outfit, suppose, has enough ammunition to stand off two more\nattacks; but they know that there will be reinforcements within four\ndays. Unfortunately, the enemy can attack _more than twice_ before help\ncomes. Help will come too late.\n\n\"Or, it could be that they have enough water to last a week, but help\nwon't come for a month.\n\n\"You follow me, I'm sure. The point, in so far as it concerns us, is\nthat we have food for about a month, but we won't get help before six\nmonths have passed. We know help is coming, but we won't be alive to see\nit.\"\n\nThen his eyes lit up in a kind of half hope. \"Unless the native flora--\"\n\nBut even before he finished, he could see the look in Dr. Pilar's eyes.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBroderick MacNeil was a sick man. The medical officers of the Space\nService did not agree with him _in toto_, but MacNeil was in a position\nto know more about his own state of health than the doctors, because it\nwas, after all, he himself who was sick.\n\nRarely, of course, did he draw the attention of the medical officers to\nhis ever-fluctuating assortment of aches, pains, signs, symptoms,\nmalaises, and malfunctions. After all, it wouldn't do for him to be\nreleased from the Service on a Medical Discharge. No, he would suffer in\nsilence for the sake of his chosen career--which, apparently, was to be\na permanent Spaceman 2nd Class.\n\nBroderick MacNeil had never seen his medical record, and therefore did\nnot know that, aside from mention of the normal slight defects which\nevery human body possesses, the only note on the records was one which\nsaid: \"Slight tendency toward hypochondria, compensated for by tendency\nto immerse self in job at hand. According to psych tests, he can\ncompetently handle positions up to Enlisted Space Officer 3rd Class, but\npositions of ESO/2 and above should be carefully considered. (See Psych\nRept. Intelligence Sectn.)\"\n\nBut, if MacNeil did not know what the medics thought of him, neither did\nthe medics know what he thought of them. Nor did they know that MacNeil\ncarried a secret supply of his own personal palliatives, purgatives and\npoly-purpose pills. He kept them carefully concealed in a small section\nof his space locker, and had labeled them all as various vitamin\nmixtures, which made them seem perfectly legal, and which was not _too_\ndishonest, since many of them _were_ vitamins.\n\nOn the morning after the fire, he heaved his well-muscled bulk out of\nbed and scratched his scalp through the close-cropped brown hair that\ncovered his squarish skull. He did not feel well, and that was a fact.\nOf course, he had been up half the night fighting the blaze, and that\nhadn't helped any. He fancied he had a bit of a headache, and his nerves\nseemed a little jangled. His insides were probably in their usual balky\nstate. He sighed, wished he were in better health, and glanced around at\nthe other members of the company as they rose grumpily from their beds.\n\nHe sighed again, opened his locker, took out his depilator, and ran it\nquickly over his face. Then, from his assortment of bottles, he began\npicking over his morning dosage. Vitamins, of course; got to keep plenty\nof vitamins in the system, or it goes all to pot on you. A, B_1, B_2,\nB_12, C, ... and on down the alphabet and past it to A-G. All-purpose\nmineral capsules, presumably containing every element useful to the\nhuman body and possibly a couple that weren't. Two APC capsules.\n(Aspirin-Phenacetin-Caffeine. He liked the way those words sounded; very\nmedicinal.) A milk-of-magnesia tablet, just in case. A couple of\npatent-mixture pills that were supposed to increase the bile flow.\n(MacNeil wasn't quite sure what bile was, but he _was_ quite sure that\nits increased flow would work wonders within.) A largish tablet of\nsodium bicarbonate to combat excess gastric acidity--obviously a\n_horrible_ condition, whatever it was. He topped it all off with a\nfootball-shaped capsule containing Liquid Glandolene--\"_Guards the\nsystem against glandular imbalance!_\"--and felt himself ready to face\nthe day. At least, until breakfast.\n\nHe slipped several bottles into his belt-pak after he had put on his\nfield uniform, so that he could get at them at mealtimes, and trudged\nout toward the mess hall to the meager breakfast that awaited him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Specifically,\" said Colonel Fennister, \"what we want to know is: What\nare our chances of staying alive until the relief ship comes?\"\n\nHe and most of the other officers were still groggy-eyed, having had too\nmuch to do to even get an hour's sleep the night before. Only the\nphlegmatic Major Grodski looked normal; his eyes were always about half\nclosed.\n\nCaptains Jones and Bellwether, in charge of A and B Companies\nrespectively, and their lieutenants, Mawkey and Yutang, all looked grim\nand irritable.\n\nThe civilian components of the policy group looked not one whit better.\nDr. Pilar had been worriedly rubbing at his face, so that his normally\nneat beard had begun to take on the appearance of a ruptured mohair\nsofa; Dr. Petrelli, the lean, waspish chemist, was nervously trimming\nhis fingernails with his teeth: and the M.D., Dr. Smathers, had a\nhangdog expression on his pudgy face and had begun drumming his fingers\nin a staccato tattoo on his round belly.\n\nDr. Pilar tapped a stack of papers that lay before him on the long table\nat which they were all seated. \"I have Major Grodski's report on the\nremaining food. There is not enough for all of us to live, even on the\nmost extended rations. Only the strongest will survive.\"\n\nColonel Fennister scowled. \"You mean to imply that we'll be fighting\nover the food like animals before this is over? The discipline of the\nSpace Service--\"\n\nHis voice was angry, but Dr. Pilar cut him off. \"It may come to\nfighting, colonel, but, even if perfect discipline is maintained, what I\nsay will still be true. Some will die early, leaving more food for the\nremaining men. It has been a long time since anything like this has\nhappened on Earth, but it is not unknown in the Space Service annals.\"\n\nThe colonel pursed his lips and kept his silence. He knew that what the\nbiologist said was true.\n\n\"The trouble is,\" said Petrelli snappishly, \"that we are starving in the\nmidst of plenty. We are like men marooned in the middle of an ocean with\nno water; the water is there, but it's undrinkable.\"\n\n\"That's what I wanted to get at,\" said Colonel Fennister. \"Is there any\nchance at all that we'll find an edible plant or animal on this planet?\"\n\nThe three scientists said nothing, as if each were waiting for one of\nthe others to speak.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll life thus far found in the galaxy had had a carbon-hydrogen-oxygen\nbase. Nobody'd yet found any silicon based life, although a good many\norganisms used the element. No one yet had found a planet with a halogen\natmosphere, and, although there might be weird forms of life at the\nbottom of the soupy atmospheres of the methane-ammonia giants, no brave\nsoul had ever gone down to see--at least, not on purpose, and no\ninformation had ever come back.\n\nBut such esoteric combinations are not at all necessary for the\npostulation of wildly variant life forms. Earth itself was prolific in\nits variations; Earthlike planets were equally inventive. Carbon,\nhydrogen, and oxygen, plus varying proportions of phosphorus, potassium,\niodine, nitrogen, sulfur, calcium, iron, magnesium, manganese, and\nstrontium, plus a smattering of trace elements, seem to be able to cook\nup all kinds of life under the strangest imaginable conditions.\n\nAlphegar IV was no different than any other Earth-type planet in that\nrespect. It had a plant-dominated ecology; the land areas were covered\nwith gigantic trees that could best be described as crosses between a\nCalifornia sequoia and a cycad, although such a description would have\nmade a botanist sneer and throw up his hands. There were enough smaller\nanimals to keep the oxygen-carbon-dioxide cycle nicely balanced, but the\nanimals had not evolved anything larger than a rat, for some reason. Of\ncourse, the sea had evolved some pretty huge monsters, but the camp of\nthe expedition was located a long way from the sea, so there was no\nworry from that quarter.\n\nAt the time, however, the members of the expedition didn't know any of\nthat information for sure. The probe teams had made spot checks and\ntaken random samples, but it was up to the First Analytical Expedition\nto make sure of everything.\n\nAnd this much they had discovered: The plants of Alphegar IV had a nasty\nhabit of killing test animals.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Of course,\" said Dr. Pilar, \"we haven't tested every plant yet. We may\ncome across something.\"\n\n\"What is it that kills the animals?\" asked young Captain Bellwether.\n\n\"Poison,\" said Major Grodski.\n\nPilar ignored him. \"Different things. Most of them we haven't been able\nto check thoroughly. We found some vines that were heavily laced with\ncyanide, and there were recognizable alkaloids in several of the shrubs,\nbut most of them are not that direct. Like Earth plants, they vary from\nfamily to family; the deadly nightshade is related to both the tobacco\nplant and the tomato.\"\n\nHe paused a moment, scratching thoughtfully at his beard.\n\n\"Tell you what; let's go over to the lab, and I'll show you what we've\nfound so far.\"\n\nColonel Fennister nodded. He was a military man, and he wasn't too sure\nthat the scientists' explanations would be very clear, but if there was\ninformation to be had, he might as well make the most of it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSM/2 Broderick MacNeil kept a firm grip on his blast rifle and looked\naround at the surrounding jungle, meanwhile thanking whatever gods there\nwere that he hadn't been put on the fence-mending detail. Not that he\nobjected violently to work, but he preferred to be out here in the\nforest just now. Breakfast hadn't been exactly filling, and he was\nhungry.\n\nBesides, this was his pet detail, and he liked it. He had been going out\nwith the technicians ever since the base had been finished, a couple of\nweeks before, and he was used to the work. The biotechnicians came out\nto gather specimens, and it was his job, along with four others, to\nguard them--make sure that no wild animal got them while they were going\nabout their duties. It was a simple job, and one well suited to\nMacNeil's capacities.\n\nHe kept an eye on the technicians. They were working on a bush of some\nkind that had little thorny-looking nuts on it, clipping bits off here\nand there. He wasn't at all sure what they did with all those little\npieces and bits, but that was none of his business, anyway. Let the\nbrains take care of that stuff; his job was to make sure they weren't\ninterrupted in whatever it was they were doing. After watching the three\ntechnicians in total incomprehension for a minute or so, he turned his\nattention to the surrounding forest. But he was looking for a plant, not\nan animal.\n\nAnd he finally saw what he was looking for.\n\nThe technicians paid him no attention. They rarely did. They had their\njob, and he had his. Of course, he didn't want to be caught breaking\nregulations, but he knew how to avoid that catastrophe. He walked\ncasually toward the tree, as though he were only slightly interested in\nit.\n\nHe didn't know what the name of the tree was. He'd asked a technician\nonce, and the tech had said that the tree didn't have any name yet.\nPersonally, MacNeil thought it was silly for a thing not to have a name.\nHell, _everything_ had a name.\n\nBut, if they didn't want to tell him what it was, that was all right\nwith him, too. He called it a banana-pear tree.\n\nBecause that's what the fruit reminded him of.\n\nThe fruit that hung from the tree were six or eight inches long, fat in\nthe middle, and tapering at both ends. The skin was a pale chartreuse in\ncolor, with heliotrope spots.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nMacNeil remembered the first time he'd seen one, the time he'd asked the\ntech what its name was. The tech had been picking some of them and\nputting them into plastic bags, and the faint spark of MacNeil's dim\ncuriosity had been brought to feebly flickering life.\n\n\"Hey, Doc,\" he'd said, \"whatcha gonna do with them things?\"\n\n\"Take 'em to the lab,\" said the technician, engrossed in his work.\n\nMacNeil had digested that carefully. \"Yeah?\" he'd said at last. \"What\nfor?\"\n\nThe technician had sighed and popped another fruit into a bag. He had\nattempted to explain things to Broderick MacNeil before and given it up\nas a bad job. \"We just feed 'em to the monkeys, Mac, that's all.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Broderick MacNeil.\n\nWell, that made sense, anyhow. Monkeys got to eat _something_, don't\nthey? Sure. And he had gazed at the fruit in interest.\n\nFresh fruit was something MacNeil missed. He'd heard that fresh fruit\nwas necessary for health, and on Earth he'd always made sure that he had\nplenty of it. He didn't want to get sick. But they didn't ship fresh\nfruit on an interstellar expedition, and MacNeil had felt vaguely\napprehensive about the lack.\n\nNow, however, his problems were solved. He knew that it was strictly\nagainst regulations to eat native fruit until the brass said so, but\nthat didn't worry him too much. He'd heard somewhere that a man can eat\nanything a monkey can, so he wasn't worried about it. So he'd tried one.\nIt tasted fine, something like a pear and something like a banana, and\ndifferent from either. It was just fine.\n\nSince then, he'd managed to eat a couple every day, so's to get his\nfresh fruit. It kept him healthy. Today, though, he needed more than\njust health; he was hungry, and the banana-pears looked singularly\ntempting.\n\nWhen he reached the tree, he turned casually around to see if any of the\nothers were watching. They weren't, but he kept his eye on them while he\npicked several of the fruit. Then he turned carefully around, and, with\nhis back to the others, masking his movements with his own body, he\nbegan to munch contentedly on the crisp flesh of the banana-pears.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Now, take this one, for instance,\" said Dr. Pilar. He was holding up a\nnative fruit. It bulged in the middle, and had a chartreuse rind with\nheliotrope spots on it. \"It's a very good example of exactly what we're\nup against. Ever since we discovered this particular fruit, we've been\ninterested in it because the analyses show that it should be an\nexcellent source of basic food elements. Presumably, it even tastes\ngood; our monkeys seemed to like it.\"\n\n\"What's the matter with it, then?\" asked Major Grodski, eying the fruit\nwith sleepy curiosity.\n\nDr. Pilar gave the thing a wry look and put it back in the specimen bag.\n\"Except for the fact that it has killed every one of our test\nspecimens, we don't know what's wrong with it.\"\n\nColonel Fennister looked around the laboratory at the cages full of\nchittering animals--monkeys, white mice, rats, guinea pigs, hamsters,\nand the others. Then he looked back at the scientist. \"Don't you know\nwhat killed them?\"\n\nPilar didn't answer; instead, he glanced at Dr. Smathers, the physician.\n\nSmathers steepled his fingers over his abdomen and rubbed his fingertips\ntogether. \"We're not sure. Thus far, it looks as though death was caused\nby oxygen starvation in the tissues.\"\n\n\"Some kind of anemia?\" hazarded the colonel.\n\nSmathers frowned. \"The end results are similar, but there is no drop in\nthe hemoglobin--in fact, it seems to rise a little. We're still\ninvestigating that. We haven't got all the answers yet, by any means,\nbut since we don't quite know what to look for, we're rather hampered.\"\n\nThe colonel nodded slowly. \"Lack of equipment?\"\n\n\"Pretty much so,\" admitted Dr. Smathers. \"Remember, we're just here for\npreliminary investigation. When the ship brings in more men and\nequipment--\"\n\nHis voice trailed off. Very likely, when the ship returned, it would\nfind an empty base. The first-string team simply wasn't set up for\nexhaustive work; its job was to survey the field in general and mark out\nthe problems for the complete team to solve.\n\nEstablishing the base had been of primary importance, and that was the\nsort of equipment that had been carried on the ship. That--and food. The\nscientists had only the barest essentials to work with; they had no\nelectron microscopes or any of the other complex instruments necessary\nfor exhaustive biochemical work.\n\nNow that they were engaged in a fight for survival, they felt like a\ngang of midgets attacking a herd of water-buffalo with penknives. Even\nif they won the battle, the mortality rate would be high, and their\nchances of winning were pretty small.\n\nThe Space Service officers and the scientists discussed the problem for\nover an hour, but they came to no promising conclusion.\n\nAt last, Colonel Fennister said: \"Very well, Dr. Pilar; we'll have to\nleave the food supply problem in your hands. Meanwhile, I'll try to keep\norder here in the camp.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSM/2 Broderick MacNeil may not have had a top-level grade of\nintelligence, but by the end of the second week, his conscience was\nnagging him, and he was beginning to wonder who was goofing and why.\nAfter much thinking--if we may so refer to MacNeil's painful cerebral\nprocesses--he decided to ask a few cautious questions.\n\nGoing without food tends to make for mental fogginess, snarling tempers,\nand general physical lassitude in any group of men. And, while quarter\nrations were not quite starvation meals, they closely approached it. It\nwas fortunate, therefore, that MacNeil decided to approach Dr. Pilar.\n\nDr. Petrelli's temper, waspish by nature, had become positively virulent\nin the two weeks that had passed since the destruction of the major food\ncache. Dr. Smathers was losing weight from his excess, but his\nheretofore pampered stomach was voicelessly screaming along his nerve\npassages, and his fingers had become shaky, which is unnerving in a\nsurgeon, so his temper was no better than Petrelli's.\n\nPilar, of course, was no better fed, but he was calmer than either of\nthe others by disposition, and his lean frame didn't use as much energy.\nSo, when the big hulking spaceman appeared at the door of his office\nwith his cap in his hands, he was inclined to be less brusque than he\nmight have been.\n\n\"Yes? What is it?\" he asked. He had been correlating notes in his\njournal with the thought in the back of his mind that he would never\nfinish it, but he felt that a small respite might be relaxing.\n\nMacNeil came in and looked nervously around at the plain walls of the\npre-fab plastic dome-hut as though seeking consolation from them. Then\nhe straightened himself in the approved military manner and looked at\nthe doctor.\n\n\"You Dr. Piller? Sir?\"\n\n\"Pi_lar_,\" said the scientist in correction. \"If you're looking for the\nmedic, you'll want Dr. Smathers, over in G Section.\"\n\n\"Oh, yessir,\" said MacNeil quickly, \"I know that. But I ain't sick.\" He\ndidn't feel _that_ sick, anyway. \"I'm Spaceman Second MacNeil, sir, from\nB Company. Could I ask you something, sir?\"\n\nPilar sighed a little, then smiled. \"Go ahead, spaceman.\"\n\nMacNeil wondered if maybe he'd ought to ask the doctor about his\nsacroiliac pains, then decided against it. This wasn't the time for it.\n\"Well, about the food. Uh ... Doc, can men eat monkey food all right?\"\n\nPilar smiled. \"Yes. What food there is left for the monkeys has already\nbeen sent to the men's mess hall.\" He didn't add that the lab animals\nwould be the next to go. Quick-frozen, they might help eke out the\ndwindling food supply, but it would be better not to let the men know\nwhat they were eating for a while. When they got hungry enough, they\nwouldn't care.\n\nBut MacNeil was plainly puzzled by Pilar's answer. He decided to\napproach the stuff as obliquely as he knew how.\n\n\"Doc, sir, if I ... I uh ... well--\" He took the bit in his teeth and\nplunged ahead. \"If I done something against the regulations, would you\nhave to report me to Captain Bellwether?\"\n\nDr. Pilar leaned back in his chair and looked at the big man with\ninterest. \"Well,\" he said carefully, \"that would all depend on what it\nwas. If it was something really ... ah ... dangerous to the welfare of\nthe expedition, I'd have to say something about it, I suppose, but I'm\nnot a military officer, and minor infractions don't concern me.\"\n\nMacNeil absorbed that \"Well, sir, this ain't much, really--I ate\nsomething I shouldn't of.\"\n\nPilar drew down his brows. \"Stealing food, I'm afraid, would be a major\noffense, under the circumstances.\"\n\nMacNeil looked both startled and insulted. \"Oh, nossir! I never swiped\nno food! In fact, I've been givin' my chow to my buddies.\"\n\nPilar's brows lifted. He suddenly realized that the man before him\nlooked in exceptionally good health for one who had been on a marginal\ndiet for two weeks. \"Then what _have_ you been living on?\"\n\n\"The monkey food, sir.\"\n\n\"_Monkey food?_\"\n\n\"Yessir. Them greenish things with the purple spots. You know--them\nfruits you feed the monkeys on.\"\n\nPilar looked at MacNeil goggle-eyed for a full thirty seconds before he\nburst into action.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"No, of course I won't punish him,\" said Colonel Fennister. \"Something\nwill have to go on the record, naturally, but I'll just restrict him to\nbarracks for thirty days and then recommend him for light duty. But are\nyou _sure_?\"\n\n\"I'm sure,\" said Pilar, half in wonder.\n\nFennister glanced over at Dr. Smathers, now noticeably thinner in the\nface. The medic was looking over MacNeil's record. \"But if that fruit\nkills monkeys and rats and guinea pigs, how can a _man_ eat it?\"\n\n\"Animals differ,\" said Smathers, without taking his eyes off the record\nsheets. He didn't amplify the statement.\n\nThe colonel looked back at Pilar.\n\n\"That's the trouble with test animals,\" Dr. Pilar said, ruffling his\ngray beard with a fingertip. \"You take a rat, for instance. A rat can\nlive on a diet that would kill a monkey. If there's no vitamin A in the\ndiet, the monkey dies, but the rat makes his own vitamin A; he doesn't\nneed to import it, you might say, since he can synthesize it in his own\nbody. But a monkey can't.\n\n\"That's just one example. There are hundreds that we know of and God\nalone knows how many that we haven't found yet.\"\n\nFennister settled his own body more comfortably in the chair and\nscratched his head thoughtfully. \"Then, even after a piece of alien\nvegetation has passed all the animal tests, you still couldn't be sure\nit wouldn't kill a human?\"\n\n\"That's right. That's why we ask for volunteers. But we haven't lost a\nman so far. Sometimes a volunteer will get pretty sick, but if a food\npasses all the other tests, you can usually depend on its not killing a\nhuman being.\"\n\n\"I gather that this is a pretty unusual case, then?\"\n\nPilar frowned. \"As far as I know, yes. But if something kills all the\ntest animals, we don't ask for humans to try it out. We assume the worst\nand forget it.\" He looked musingly at the wall. \"I wonder how many\nedible plants we've by-passed that way?\" he asked softly, half to\nhimself.\n\n\"What are you going to do next?\" the colonel asked. \"My men are getting\nhungry.\"\n\nSmathers looked up from the report in alarm, and Pilar had a similar\nexpression on his face.\n\n\"For Pete's sake,\" said Smathers, \"don't tell anyone--not\n_anyone_--about this, just yet. We don't want all your men rushing out\nin the forest to gobble down those things until we are more sure of\nthem. Give us a few more days at least.\"\n\nThe colonel patted the air with a hand. \"Don't worry. I'll wait until\nyou give me the go-ahead. But I'll want to know your plans.\"\n\nPilar pursed his lips for a moment before he spoke. \"We'll check up on\nMacNeil for another forty-eight hours. We'd like to have him transferred\nover here, so that we can keep him in isolation. We'll feed him more of\nthe ... uh ... what'd he call 'em, Smathers?\"\n\n\"Banana-pears.\"\n\n\"We'll feed him more banana-pears, and keep checking. If he is still in\ngood shape, we'll ask for volunteers.\"\n\n\"Good enough,\" said the colonel. \"I'll keep in touch.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the morning of the third day in isolation, MacNeil rose early, as\nusual, gulped down his normal assortment of vitamins, added a couple of\naspirin tablets, and took a dose of Epsom salts for good measure. Then\nhe yawned and leaned back to wait for breakfast. He was certainly\ngetting enough fresh fruit, that was certain. He'd begun to worry about\nwhether he was getting a balanced diet--he'd heard that a balanced diet\nwas very important--but he figured that the doctors knew what they were\ndoing. Leave it up to them.\n\nHe'd been probed and needled and tested plenty in the last couple of\ndays, but he didn't mind it. It gave him a feeling of confidence to know\nthat the doctors were taking care of him. Maybe he ought to tell them\nabout his various troubles; they all seemed like nice guys. On the other\nhand, it wouldn't do to get booted out of the Service. He'd think it\nover for a while.\n\nHe settled back to doze a little while he waited for his breakfast to be\nserved. Sure was nice to be taken care of.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLater on that same day, Dr. Pilar put out a call for volunteers. He\nstill said nothing about MacNeil; he simply asked the colonel to say\nthat it had been eaten successfully by a test animal.\n\nThe volunteers ate their banana-pears for lunch, approaching them warily\nat first, but soon polishing them off with gusto, proclaiming them to\nhave a fine taste.\n\nThe next morning, they felt weak and listless.\n\nThirty-six hours later, they were dead.\n\n\"Oxygen starvation,\" said Smathers angrily, when he had completed the\nautopsies.\n\nBroderick MacNeil munched pleasantly on a banana-pear that evening,\nhappily unaware that three of his buddies had died of eating that\nself-same fruit.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe chemist, Dr. Petrelli, looked at the fruit in his hand, snarled\nsuddenly, and smashed it to the floor. Its skin burst, splattering pulp\nall over the gray plastic.\n\n\"It looks,\" he said in a high, savage voice, \"as if that hulking idiot\nwill be the only one left alive when the ship returns!\" He turned to\nlook at Smathers, who was peering through a binocular microscope.\n\"Smathers, what makes him different?\"\n\n\"How do I know?\" growled Dr. Smathers, still peering. \"There's something\ndifferent about him, that's all.\"\n\nPetrelli forcibly restrained his temper. \"Very funny,\" he snapped.\n\n\"Not funny at all,\" Smathers snapped back. \"No two human beings are\nidentical--you know that.\" He lifted his gaze from the eyepiece of the\ninstrument and settled in on the chemist. \"He's got AB blood type, for\none thing, which none of the volunteers had. Is that what makes him\nimmune to whatever poison is in those things? I don't know.\n\n\"Were the other three allergic to some protein substance in the fruit,\nwhile MacNeil isn't? I don't know.\n\n\"Do his digestive processes destroy the poison? I don't know.\n\n\"It's got something to do with his blood, I think, but I can't even be\nsure of that. The leucocytes are a little high, the red cell count is a\nlittle low, the hemoglobin shows a little high on the colorimeter, but\nnone of 'em seems enough to do any harm.\n\n\"It might be an enzyme that destroys the ability of the cells to utilize\noxygen. It might be _anything_!\"\n\nHis eyes narrowed then, as he looked at the chemist. \"After all, why\nhaven't you isolated the stuff from the fruit?\"\n\n\"There's no clue as to what to look for,\" said Petrelli, somewhat less\nbitingly. \"The poison might be present in microscopic amounts. Do you\nknow how much botulin toxin it takes to kill a man? A fraction of a\nmilligram!\"\n\nSmathers looked as though he were about to quote the minimum dosage, so\nPetrelli charged on: \"If you think anyone could isolate an unknown\norganic compound out of a--\"\n\n\"Gentlemen! _Please!_\" said Dr. Pilar sharply. \"I realize that this is a\nstrain, but bickering won't help. What about your latest tests on\nMacNeil, Dr. Smathers?\"\n\n\"As far as I can tell, he's in fine health. And I can't understand why,\"\nsaid the physician in a restrained voice.\n\nPilar tapped one of the report sheets. \"You mean the vitamins?\"\n\n\"I mean the vitamins,\" said Smathers. \"According to Dr. Petrelli, the\nfruits contain neither A nor B_1. After living solely on them for four\nweeks now, he should be beginning to show some deficiencies--but he's\nnot.\n\n\"No signs?\" queried Dr. Pilar. \"No symptoms?\"\n\n\"No signs--at least no abnormal ones. He's not getting enough protein,\nbut, then, none of us is.\" He made a bitter face. \"But he has plenty of\nsymptoms.\"\n\nDr. Petrelli raised a thin eyebrow. \"What's the difference between a\nsign and a symptom?\"\n\n\"A sign,\" said Smathers testily, \"is something that can be objectively\nchecked by another person than the patient. Lesions, swellings,\ninflammations, erratic heartbeat, and so on. A symptom is a subjective\nfeeling of the patient, like aches, pains, nausea, dizziness, or spots\nbefore the eyes.\n\n\"And MacNeil is beginning to get all kinds of symptoms. Trouble is, he's\ngot a record of hypochondria, and I can't tell which of the symptoms are\npsychosomatic and which, if any, might be caused by the fruit.\"\n\n\"The trouble is,\" said Petrelli, \"that we have an unidentifiable disease\ncaused by an unidentifiable agent which is checked by an unidentifiable\nsomething in MacNeil. And we have neither the time nor the equipment to\nfind out. This is a job that a fully equipped research lab might take a\ncouple of years to solve.\"\n\n\"We can keep trying,\" said Pilar, \"and hope we stumble across it by\naccident.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nPetrelli nodded and picked up the beaker he'd been heating over an\nelectric plate. He added a chelating agent which, if there were any\nnickel present, would sequester the nickel ions and bring them out of\nsolution as a brick-red precipitate.\n\nSmathers scowled and bent over his microscope to count more leucocytes.\n\nPilar pushed his notes aside and went over to check his agar plates in\nthe constant-temperature box.\n\nThe technicians who had been listening to the conversation with ears\nwide open went back to their various duties.\n\nAnd all of them tried in vain to fight down the hunger pangs that were\ncorroding at their insides.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBroderick MacNeil lay in his bed and felt pleasantly ill. He treasured\neach one of his various symptoms; each pain and ache was just right. He\nhadn't been so comfortable in years. It really felt fine to have all\nthose doctors fussing over him. They got snappy and irritable once in a\nwhile, but then, all them brainy people had a tendency to do that. He\nwondered how the rest of the boys were doing on their diet of\nbanana-pears. Too bad they weren't getting any special treatment.\n\nMacNeil had decided just that morning that he'd leave the whole state of\nhis health in the hands of the doctors. No need for a fellow to dose\nhimself when there were three medics on the job, was there? If he needed\nanything, they'd give it to him, so he'd decided to take no medicine.\n\nA delightful, dulling lassitude was creeping over him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"MacNeil! _MacNeil!_ Wake up, MacNeil!\"\n\nThe spaceman vaguely heard the voice, and tried to respond, but a sudden\ndizziness overtook him. His stomach felt as though it were going to come\nloose from his interior.\n\n\"I'm sick,\" he said weakly. Then, with a terrible realization, \"I'm\nreally _awful_ sick!\"\n\nHe saw Dr. Smathers' face swimming above him and tried to lift himself\nfrom the bed. \"Shoulda taken pills,\" he said through the haze that was\nbeginning to fold over him again. \"Locker box.\" And then he was\nunconscious again.\n\nDr. Smathers looked at him bleakly. The same thing was killing MacNeil\nas had killed the others. It had taken longer--much longer. But it had\ncome.\n\nAnd then the meaning of the spaceman's mumbled words came to him. Pills?\nLocker box?\n\nHe grabbed the unconscious man's right hand and shoved his right thumb\nup against the sensor plate in the front of the metal box next to the\nbed. He could have gotten the master key from Colonel Fennister, but he\nhadn't the time.\n\nThe box door dilated open, and Dr. Smathers looked inside.\n\nWhen he came across the bottles, he swore under his breath, then flung\nthe spaceman's arm down and ran from the room.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"That's where he was getting his vitamins, then,\" said Dr. Pilar as he\nlooked over the assortment of bottles that he and Smathers had taken\nfrom the locker box. \"Look at 'em. He's got almost as many pills as you\nhave.\" He looked up at the physician. \"Do you suppose it was just\nvitamins that kept him going?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Smathers. \"I've given him massive doses of every\none of the vitamins--from my own supplies, naturally. He may rally\nround, if that's what it was. But why would he suddenly be affected by\nthe stuff _now_?\"\n\n\"Maybe he quit taking them?\" Pilar made it half a question.\n\n\"It's possible,\" agreed Smathers. \"A hypochondriac will sometimes leave\noff dosing himself if there's a doctor around to do it for him. As long\nas the subconscious need is filled, he's happy.\" But he was shaking his\nhead.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" Pilar asked.\n\nSmathers pointed at the bottles. \"Some of those are mislabeled. They all\nsay vitamins of one kind or another on the label, but the tablets inside\naren't all vitamins. MacNeil's been giving himself all kinds of things.\"\n\nPilar's eyes widened a trifle. \"Do you suppose--\"\n\n\"That one of them is an antidote?\" Smathers snorted. \"Hell, anything's\npossible at this stage of the game. The best thing we can do, I think,\nis give him a dose of everything there, and see what happens.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Yeah, Doc, yeah,\" said MacNeil smiling weakly, \"I feel a little better.\nNot real good, you understand, but better.\"\n\nUnder iron control, Dr. Smathers put on his best bedside manner, while\nPilar and Petrelli hovered in the background.\n\n\"Now, look, son,\" said Smathers in a kindly voice, \"we found the\nmedicines in your locker box.\"\n\nMacNeil's face fell, making him look worse. He'd dropped down close to\ndeath before the conglomerate mixture which had been pumped into his\nstomach had taken effect, and Smathers had no desire to put too much\npressure on the man.\n\n\"Now, don't worry about it, son,\" he said hurriedly; \"We'll see to it\nthat you aren't punished for it. It's all right. We just want to ask you\na few questions.\"\n\n\"Sure, Doc; anything,\" said MacNeil. But he still looked apprehensive.\n\n\"Have you been dosing yourself pretty regularly with these things?\"\n\n\"Well ... uh ... well, yeah. Sometimes.\" He smiled feebly. \"Sometimes I\ndidn't feel so good, and I didn't want to bother the medics. You know\nhow it is.\"\n\n\"Very considerate, I'm sure,\" said Smathers with just the barest trace\nof sarcasm, which, fortunately, fell unheeded on MacNeil's ears. \"But\nwhich ones did you take every day?\"\n\n\"Just the vitamins.\" He paused. \"And ... uh ... maybe an aspirin. The\nonly things I took real regular were the vitamins, though. That's all\nright ain't it? Ain't vitamins food?\"\n\n\"Sure, son, sure. What did you take yesterday morning, before you got so\nsick?\"\n\n\"Just the vitamins,\" MacNeil said stoutly. \"I figured that since you\ndocs was takin' care of me, I didn't need no medicine.\"\n\nDr. Smathers glanced up hopelessly at the other two men. \"That\neliminates the vitamins,\" he said, _sotto voce_. He looked back at the\npatient. \"No aspirin? No APC's? You didn't have a headache at all?\"\n\nMacNeil shook his head firmly. \"I don't get headaches much.\" Again he\nessayed a feeble smile. \"I ain't like you guys, I don't overwork my\nbrains.\"\n\n\"I'm sure you don't,\" said Smathers. Then his eyes gleamed. \"You have\nquite a bit of stomach trouble, eh? Your digestion bad?\"\n\n\"Yeah. You know; I told you about it. I get heartburn and acid stomach\npretty often. And constipation.\"\n\n\"What do you take for that?\"\n\n\"Oh, different things. Sometimes a soda pill, sometimes milk of\nmagnesia, different things.\"\n\nSmathers looked disappointed, but before he could say anything, Dr.\nPetrelli's awed but excited voice came from behind him. \"Do you take\nEpsom salts?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"I wonder--\" said Petrelli softly.\n\nAnd then he left for the lab at a dead run.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nColonel Fennister and Major Grodski sat at the table in the lab,\nmunching on banana-pears, blissfully enjoying the sweet flavor and the\nfeeling of fullness they were imparting to their stomachs.\n\n\"MacNeil can't stay in the service, of course,\" said Fennister. \"That\nis, not in any space-going outfit. We'll find an Earthside job for him,\nthough. Maybe even give him a medal. You sure these things won't hurt\nus?\"\n\nDr. Pilar started to speak, but Petrelli cut him off.\n\n\"Positive,\" said the chemist. \"After we worked it out, it was pretty\nsimple. The 'poison' was a chelating agent, that's all. You saw the test\nrun I did for you.\"\n\nThe colonel nodded. He'd watched the little chemist add an iron salt to\nsome of the fruit juice and seen it turn red. Then he'd seen it turn\npale yellow when a magnesium salt was added. \"But what's a chelating\nagent?\" he asked.\n\n\"There are certain organic compounds,\" Dr. Petrelli explained, \"that are\n... well, to put it simply, they're attracted by certain ions. Some are\nattracted by one ion, some by another. The chelating molecules cluster\naround the ion and take it out of circulation, so to speak; they\nneutralize it, in a way.\n\n\"Look, suppose you had a dangerous criminal on the loose, and didn't\nhave any way to kill him. If you kept him surrounded by policemen all\nthe time, he couldn't do anything. See?\"\n\nThe Space Service Officers nodded their understanding.\n\n\"We call that 'sequestering' the ion,\" the chemist continued. \"It's used\nquite frequently in medicine, as Dr. Smathers will tell you. For\ninstance, beryllium ions in the body can be deadly; beryllium poisoning\nis nasty stuff. But if the patient is treated with the proper chelating\nagent, the ions are surrounded and don't do any more damage. They're\nstill there, but now they're harmless, you see.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" said the colonel, \"just what did this stuff in the fruit\ndo?\"\n\n\"It sequestered the iron ions in the body. They couldn't do their job.\nThe body had to quit making hemoglobin, because hemoglobin needs iron.\nSo, since there was no hemoglobin in the bloodstream, the patient\ndeveloped sudden pernicious anemia and died of oxygen starvation.\"\n\nColonel Fennister looked suddenly at Dr. Smathers. \"I thought you said\nthe blood looked normal.\"\n\n\"It did,\" said the physician. \"The colorimeter showed extra hemoglobin,\nin fact. But the chelating agent in the fruit turns red when it's\nconnected up with iron--in fact, it's even redder than blood hemoglobin.\nAnd the molecules containing the sequestered iron tend to stick to the\noutside of the red blood cells, which threw the whole test off.\"\n\n\"As I understand it, then,\" said Major Grodski, \"the antidote for the\n... uh ... chelating agent is magnesium?\"\n\n\"That's right,\" said Dr. Petrelli, nodding. \"The stuff prefers magnesium\nions to ferrous ions. They fit better within the chelating ring. Any\nsource of magnesium will do, so long as there's plenty of it. MacNeil\nwas using milk of magnesia, which is the hydroxide, for 'gastric\nacidity'. It's changed to chloride in the stomach. And he was using\nEpsom salts--the sulfate, and magnesium citrate as laxatives. He was\nwell protected with magnesium ions.\"\n\n\"We tried it ourselves first, naturally,\" said Dr. Pilar. \"We haven't\nhad any ill effects for two days, so I think we'll be able to make it\nuntil the ship comes.\"\n\nMajor Grodski sighed. \"Well, if not, I'll at least die with a full\nstomach.\" He reached for another banana-pear, then looked over at\nPetrelli. \"Pass the salt, please.\"\n\nSilently and solemnly, the chemist handed him the Epsom salts.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n  +--------------------------------------------------------------+\n  |                Transcriber's Note and Errata                 |\n  |                                                              |\n  | This etext was produced from Astounding Science Fiction, May |\n  | 1959.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
