Their initial adventures are a\n    classic of science-fiction which first brought the name\n    of their author, John W. Campbell, into prominence as a\n    master of the inventive imagination.\n\n\n\n    JOHN W. CAMPBELL first started writing in 1930 when his\n    first short story, _When the Atoms Failed_, was\n    accepted by a science-fiction magazine. At that time he\n    was twenty years old and still a student at college. As\n    the title of the story indicates, he was even at that\n    time occupied with the significance of atomic energy\n    and nuclear physics.\n\n    For the next seven years, Campbell, bolstered by a\n    scientific background that ran from childhood\n    experiments, to study at Duke University and the\n    Massachusetts Institute of Technology, wrote and sold\n    science-fiction, achieving for himself an enviable\n    reputation in the field.\n\n    In 1937 he became the editor of _Astounding Stories_\n    magazine and applied himself at once to the task of\n    bettering the magazine and the field of s-f writing in\n    general. His influence on science-fiction since then\n    cannot be underestimated. Today he still remains as the\n    editor of that magazine's evolved and redesigned\n    successor, _Analog_.\n\n\n\nTHE BLACK STAR PASSES\n\nJOHN W.

The essence of any magazine is\nnot its name, but its philosophy, its purpose. That old _Amazing\nStories_ is long since gone; the magazine of the same name today is\nas different as the times today are different from the world of 1930.\n\nScience-fiction was new, in 1930; atomic energy was a dream we\nbelieved in, and space-travel was something we tried to understand\nbetter. Today, science-fiction has become a broad field, atomic\nenergy--despite the feelings of many present adults!--is no dream.\n(Nor is it a nightmare; it is simply a fact, and calling it a\nnightmare is another form of effort to push it out of reality.)\n\nIn 1930, the only audience for science-fiction was among those who\nwere still young enough in spirit to be willing to hope and speculate\non a new and wider future--and in 1930 that meant almost nothing but\nteen-agers. It meant the brightest group of teen-agers, youngsters who\nwere willing to _play_ with ideas and understandings of physics\nand chemistry and astronomy that most of their contemporaries\nconsidered \"too hard work.\"\n\nI grew up with that group; the stories I wrote over the years, and,\nlater, the stories I bought for _Astounding Science Fiction_\nchanged and grew more mature too. _Astounding Science Fiction_\ntoday has many of the audience that read those early stories; they're\nnot high school and college students any more, of course, but\nprofessional engineers, technologists and researchers now. Naturally,\nfor them we need a totally different kind of story. In growing with\nthem, I and my work had to lose much of the enthusiastic scope that\nwent with the earlier science fiction.\n\nWhen a young man goes to college, he is apt to say, \"I want to be a\nscientist,\" or \"I want to be an engineer,\" but his concepts are broad\nand generalized. Most major technical schools, well knowing this, have\nthe first year course for _all_ students the same. Only in the\nsecond and subsequent years does specialization start.\n\nBy the sophomore year, a student may say, \"I want to be a\n_chemical_ engineer.\"\n\nAt graduation, he may say, \"I'm going into chemical engineering\n_construction_.\"\n\nTen years later he may explain that he's a chemical engineer\nspecializing in the construction of corrosion-resistant structures,\nsuch as electroplating baths and pickling tanks for stainless steel.\n\nYear by year, his knowledge has become more specialized, and much\ndeeper. He's better and better able to do the important work the world\nneeds done, but in learning to do it, he's necessarily lost some of\nthe broad and enthusiastic scope he once had.\n\nThese are early stories of the early days of science-fiction. Radar\nhadn't been invented; we missed that idea. But while these stories\ndon't have the finesse of later work--they have a bounding enthusiasm\nthat belongs with a young field, designed for and built by young men.\nMost of the writers of those early stories were, like myself, college\nstudents. (_Piracy Preferred_ was written while I was a sophomore\nat M.I.T.)\n\nFor old-timers in science-fiction--these are typical of the\ndays when the field was starting. They've got a fine flavor\nof our own younger enthusiasm.\n\nFor new readers of science-fiction--these have the stuff that laid the\ngroundwork of today's work, they're the stories that were meant for\nyoung imaginations, for people who wanted to think about the world\nthey had to build in the years to come.\n\nAlong about sixteen to nineteen, a young man has to decide what is,\nfor him, the Job That Needs Doing--and get ready to get in and pitch.\nIf he selects well, selects with understanding and foresight, he'll\npick a job that _does_ need doing, one that will return rewards\nin satisfaction as well as money. No other man can pick that for him;\nhe must choose the Job that _he_ feels fitting.\n\nCrystal balls can be bought fairly reasonably--but they don't work\nwell. History books can be bought even more cheaply, and they're\nmoderately reliable. (Though necessarily filtered through the cultural\nattitudes of the man who wrote them.) But they don't work well as\npredicting machines, because the world is changing too rapidly.\n\nThe world today, for instance, needs engineers desperately. There a\nlot of jobs that the Nation would like to get done that can't even be\nstarted; not enough engineers available.\n\nFifty years ago the engineering student was a sort of Second Class\nCitizen of the college campus. Today the Liberal Arts are fighting for\na come-back, the pendulum having swung considerably too far in the\nother direction.\n\nSo science-fiction has a very real function to the teen-agers; it\npresents varying ideas of what the world in which he will live his\nadult life will be interested in.\n\nThis is 1953. My son will graduate in 1955. The period of his peak\nearning power should be when he's about forty to sixty--about 1970,\nsay, to 1990. With the progress being made in understanding of health\nand physical vigor, it's apt to run beyond 2000 A.D., however.\n\nAnyone want to bet that people will be living in the same general\ncircumstances then? That the same general social and cultural and\nmaterial standards will apply?\n\nI have a hunch that the history books are a poor way of planning a\nlife today--and that science-fiction comes a lot closer.\n\nThere's another thing about science-fiction yarns that is quite\nconspicuous; it's so difficult to pick out the villains. It might have\nmade quite a change in history if the ballads and tales of the old\ndays had been a little less sure of who the villains were. Read the\nstandard boy's literature of forty years ago; tales of Crusaders who\nwere always right, and Saracens who were always wrong. (The same\nSaracens who taught the Christians to respect the philosophy of the\nGreeks, and introduced them to the basic ideas of straight,\nself-disciplined thinking!)\n\nLife's much simpler in a thatched cottage than in a dome on the\nairless Moon, easier to understand when the Villains are all pure\nblack-hearted villains, and the Heroes are all pure White Souled\nHeroes. Just look how simple history is compared with science-fiction!\nIt's simple--but is it good?\n\nThese early science-fiction tales explored the Universe; they were\nprobings, speculations, as to where we _could_ go. What we\n_could_ do.\n\nThey had a sweep and reach and exuberance that belonged.\n\nThey _were_ fun, too....\n\nJohn W. Campbell, Jr.\nMountainside, N.J.\nApril, 1953\n\n\n\n\nBOOK ONE\n\nPIRACY PREFERRED\n\n\n\n\nPROLOGUE\n\n\nHigh in the deep blue of the afternoon sky rode a tiny speck of\nglistening metal, scarcely visible in the glare of the sun. The workers\non the machines below glanced up for a moment, then back to their work,\nthough little enough it was on these automatic cultivators. Even this\nminor diversion was of interest in the dull monotony of green. These\nendless fields of castor bean plants had to be cultivated, but with the\ngreat machines that did the work it required but a few dozen men to\ncultivate an entire county.\n\nThe passengers in the huge plane high above them gave little thought to\nwhat passed below, engrossed with their papers or books, or engaged in\ncasual conversation. This monotonous trip was boring to most of them. It\nseemed a waste of time to spend six good hours in a short 3,500 mile\ntrip. There was nothing to do, nothing to see, except a slowly passing\nlandscape ten miles below. No details could be distinguished, and the\nsteady low throb of the engines, the whirring of the giant propellers,\nthe muffled roar of the air, as it rushed by, combined to form a\nsoothing lullaby of power. It was all right for pleasure seekers and\nvacationists, but business men were in a hurry.\n\nThe pilot of the machine glanced briefly at the instruments, wondered\nvaguely why he had to be there at all, then turned, and leaving the\npilot room in charge of his assistant, went down to talk with the chief\nengineer.\n\nHis vacation began the first of July, and as this was the last of June,\nhe wondered what would have happened if he had done as he had been half\ninclined to do--quit the trip and let the assistant take her through. It\nwould have been simple--just a few levers to manipulate, a few controls\nto set, and the instruments would have taken her up to ten or eleven\nmiles, swung her into the great westward air current, and leveled her\noff at five hundred and sixty or so an hour toward 'Frisco'. They would\nhold her on the radio beam better than he ever could. Even the landing\nwould have been easy. The assistant had never landed a big plane, but he\nknew the routine, and the instruments would have done the work. Even if\nhe hadn't been there, ten minutes after they had reached destination, it\nwould land automatically--if an emergency pilot didn't come up by that\ntime in answer to an automatic signal.\n\nHe yawned and sauntered down the hall. He yawned again, wondering what\nmade him so sleepy.\n\nHe slumped limply to the floor and lay there breathing ever more and\nmore slowly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe officials of the San Francisco terminus of The Transcontinental\nAirways company were worried. The great Transcontinental express had\ncome to the field, following the radio beam, and now it was circling the\nfield with its instruments set on the automatic signal for an emergency\npilot. They were worried and with good reason, for this flight carried\nover 900,000 dollars worth of negotiable securities. But what could\nattack one of those giant ships? It would take a small army to overcome\nthe crew of seventy and the three thousand passengers!\n\nThe great ship was landing gently now, brought in by the emergency\npilot. The small field car sped over to the plane rapidly. Already the\nelevator was in place beside it, and as the officials in the car drew up\nunder the giant wing, they could see the tiny figure of the emergency\npilot beckoning to them. Swiftly the portable elevator carried them up\nto the fourth level of the ship.\n\nWhat a sight met their eyes as they entered the main salon! At first\nglance it appeared that all the passengers lay sleeping in their chairs.\nOn closer examination it became evident that they were not breathing!\nThe ear could detect no heartbeat. The members of the crew lay at their\nposts, as inert as the passengers! The assistant pilot sprawled on the\nfloor beside the instrument panel--apparently he had been watching the\nrecord of the flight. There was no one conscious--or apparently\nliving--on board!\n\n\"Dead! Over three thousand people!\" The field manager's voice was\nhoarse, incredulous. \"It's impossible--how could they have done it? Gas,\nmaybe, drawn in through the ventilator pumps and circulated through the\nship. But I can't conceive of any man being willing to kill three\nthousand people for a mere million! Did you call a doctor by radio,\nPilot?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. He is on his way. There's his car now.\"\n\n\"Of course they will have opened the safe--but let's check anyway. I can\nonly think some madman has done this--no sane man would be willing to\ntake so many lives for so little.\" Wearily the men descended the stairs\nto the mail room in the hold.\n\nThe door was closed, but the lock of the door was gone, the\nmagnesium-beryllium alloy burned away. They opened the door and entered.\nThe room seemed in perfect order. The guard lay motionless in the steel\nguard chamber at one side; the thick, bullet-proof glass made his\noutlines a little blurred, and the color of his face was green--but they\nknew there too must be that same pallor they had seen on the other\nfaces. The delicate instruments had brought in the great ship perfectly,\nbut it was freighted with a cargo of dead!\n\nThey entered the room and proceeded to the safe, but it was opened as\nthey had expected. The six-inch tungsto-iridium wall had been melted\nthrough. Even this unbelievable fact no longer surprised them. They\nonly glanced at the metal, still too hot to touch, and looked about the\nroom. The bonds had been taken. But now they noticed that over the\nmail-clerk's desk there had been fastened a small envelope. On it was\nprinted:\n\n    To the Officials of the San Francisco Airport\n\nInside was a short message, printed in the same sharp, black letters:\n\n    Gentlemen:\n\n    This plane should land safely. If it doesn't, it is your\n    fault, not mine, for the instruments that it carries\n    should permit it. The passengers are NOT dead! They have\n    been put in a temporary state of suspended animation.\n    Any doctor can readily revive them by the injection of\n    seven c.c. of decinormal potassium iodide solution for\n    every 100 pounds of weight. Do NOT use higher\n    concentrations. Lower concentrations will act more\n    slowly.\n\n    You will find that any tendency toward leprosy or cancer\n    will have been destroyed. It will kill any existing\n    cancer, and cure it in about one week. I have not\n    experimented with leprosy beyond knowing that it is\n    cured very quickly.\n\n    This is an outside job. Don't annoy the passengers with\n    questions.\n\n    The gas used cannot be stopped by any material I know\n    of. You can try it with any mask--but don't use the\n    C-32L. It will react with the gas to kill. I would\n    advise that you try it on an animal to convince\n    yourselves.\n\n    I have left stock in my new company to replace the bonds\n    I have taken.\n\n    Piracy Incorporated is incorporated under my own laws.\n\n                                                  The Pirate\n\nOn the desk beneath the note was a small package which contained a\nnumber of stock certificates. They totalled $900,000 face value of\n\"Piracy Preferred\", the preferred stock of a corporation, \"Piracy, Inc.\"\n\n\"Piracy! Pirates in the air!\" The field manager forced an unnatural\nlaugh. \"In 2126 we have pirates attacking our air lines. _Piracy\nPreferred!_ I think I'd prefer the bonds myself. But thank God he did\nnot kill all those people. Doctor, you look worried! Cheer up. If what\nthis pirate says is true, we can resuscitate them, and they'll be better\noff for the experience!\"\n\nThe doctor shook his head. \"I've been examining your passengers. I'm\nafraid that you'll never be able to bring these people back to life\nagain, sir. I can't detect any heart action even with the amplifier.\nOrdinary heart action sounds like a cataract through this instrument. I\ncan see nothing wrong with the blood; it has not coagulated as I\nexpected, nor is there any pronounced hydrolysis as yet. But I'm afraid\nI'll have to write out the death warrants for all these men and women.\nOne of the people on that ship was coming to see me. That's how I\nhappened to be on the field. For her, at least, it may be better so. The\npoor woman was suffering from an incurable cancer.\"\n\n\"In this case, Doctor, I hope and believe you are wrong. Read this\nnote!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was two hours before the work of reviving the passengers could be\nstarted. Despite all the laws of physics, their body temperature had\nremained constant after it had reached seventy-four, showing that some\nform of very slow metabolism was going on. One by one they were put into\nlarge electric blankets, and each was given the correct dose of the\nsalt. The men waited anxiously for results--and within ten minutes of\nthe injection the first had regained consciousness!\n\nThe work went forward steadily and successfully. Every one of the\npassengers and crew was revived. And the Pirate had spoken the truth.\nThe woman who had been suffering from cancer was free from pain for the\nfirst time in many months. Later, careful examination proved she was\ncured!\n\nThe papers were issuing extras within five minutes of the time the great\nplane had landed, and the radio news service was broadcasting the first\n\"break\" in a particularly dead month. During all of June the news had\nbeen dead, and now July had begun with a bang!\n\nWith time to think and investigate, the airport officials went over the\nship with the Air Guard, using a fine-tooth comb. It was soon evident\nthat the job had been done from the outside, as the Pirate had said. The\nemergency pilot testified that when he entered the ship, he found a\nsmall piece of wire securing the air lock from the outside. This had\ncertainly been put on while the ship was in flight, and that meant that\nwhoever had done this, had landed on the great ship with a small plane,\nhad somehow anchored it, then had entered the plane through the air lock\nat the ten mile height. He had probably flown across the path of the\nplane, leaving a trail of gas in its way to be drawn in through the\nventilator pumps. It had been washed out by the incoming good air later,\nfor the emergency pilot had not been affected.\n\nNow the investigation led them to the mail-room. Despite the refractory\nnature of the metal, the door had been opened by melting or burning out\nthe lock. And an opening had been burned into the safe itself! Opened by\nmelting it through!\n\nA bond shipment was due the next day, and the airline officials planned\nto be on the watch for it. It would get through safely, they were sure,\nfor men were put on board in steel chambers hermetically welded behind\nthem, with oxygen tanks and automatic apparatus sealed within to supply\nthem with clean air. The front of the tanks were equipped with\nbullet-proof glass windows, and by means of electrically operated\ncontrols the men inside could fire machine guns. Thus they were\nprotected from the Pirate's gas and able to use their weapons.\n\nThe ship was accompanied by a patrol of Air Guardsmen. Yet, despite,\nthis, cancer cases were aboard with the hope of being gassed.\n\nWhen the plane reached the neighborhood of San Francisco, there had been\nno sign of an attack. The Pirate might well retire permanently on a\nmillion, if he were alone, as the singular signature indicated; but it\nseemed much more probable that he would attempt another attack in any\ncase. Well, that just meant watching all the planes from now on, a\ntremendous job for the Air Guard to handle.\n\nThe leader of the patrol turned in an easy bank to descend the ten miles\nto Earth, and his planes followed him. Then suddenly through the\ncommunicator came an unmistakable sound. _The plane automatically\nsignaling for an emergency pilot!_ That could only mean that the plane\nhad been gassed under the very eyes of his men!\n\nThe bonds were gone and the passengers gassed, and incredibly, the men\nin the steel tanks were as thoroughly gassed as the rest.\n\nThe note was brief, and as much to the point as was the absence of the\nbonds.\n\n\n    To the Officials of the Airport:\n\n    Restore as usual. The men in the tanks are asleep\n    also--I said the gas would penetrate _any_ material. It\n    does. A mask obviously won't do any good. Don't try that\n    C-32L mask. I warn you it will be fatal. My gas reacts\n    to produce a virulent poison when in contact with the\n    chemicals in the C-32L.\n\n                                                  The Pirate\n\n\n\n\nI.\n\n\nOn the thirty-ninth floor of a large New York apartment two young men\nwere lounging about after a strenuous game of tennis. The blue tendrils\nof smoke from their pipes rose slowly, to be drawn away by the efficient\nventilating system. The taller of the two seemed to be doing most of the\ntalking. In the positions they had assumed it would have been rather\ndifficult to be sure of which was the taller, but Robert Morey was a\ngood four inches taller than Richard Arcot. Arcot had to suffer under\nthe stigma of \"runt\" with Morey around--he was only six feet tall.\n\nThe chosen occupation of each was physical research, and in that field\nArcot could well have called Morey \"runt\", for Arcot had only one\ncompetitor--his father. In this case it had been \"like father, like\nson\". For many years Robert Arcot had been known as the greatest\nAmerican physicist, and probably the world's greatest. More recently he\nhad been known as the father of the world's greatest physicist. Arcot\njunior was probably one of the most brilliant men the world had ever\nseen, and he was aided in all his work by two men who could help him in\na way that amplified his powers a thousand fold. His father and his best\nfriend, Morey, were the complimentary and balancing minds to his great\nintelligence. His father had learned through years of work the easiest\nand best ways of performing the many difficult feats of laboratory\nexperimentation. Morey could develop the mathematical theory of a\nhypothesis far more readily than Arcot could. Morey's mind was more\nmethodical and exact than Arcot's, but Arcot could grasp the broad\ndetails of a problem and get the general method of solution developed\nwith a speed that made it utterly impossible for his friend even to\nfollow the steps he suggested.\n\nSince Arcot junior's invention of the multiple calculus, many new\nramifications of old theories had been attained, and many developments\nhad become possible.\n\nBut the factor that made Arcot so amazingly successful in his line of\nwork was his ability to see practical uses for things, an ability that\nis unfortunately lacking in so many great physicists. Had he collected\nthe royalties his inventions merited, he would have been a billionaire\ntwice or thrice over. Instead he had made contracts on the basis that\nthe laboratories he owned be kept in condition, and that he be paid a\nsalary that should be whatever he happened to need. Since he had sold\nall his inventions to Transcontinental Airways, he had been able to\ndevote all his time to science, leaving them to manage his finances.\nPerhaps it was the fact that he did sell these inventions to\nTranscontinental that made these lines so successful; but at any rate,\nPresident Arthur Morey was duly grateful, and when his son was able to\nenter the laboratories he was as delighted as Arcot.\n\nThe two had become boon companions. They worked, played, lived, and\nthought together.\n\nJust now they were talking about the Pirate. This was the seventh day of\nhis discovery, and he had been growing steadily more menacing. It was\nthe great Transcontinental Airways that had suffered most repeatedly.\nSometimes it was the San Francisco Flyer that went on without a pilot,\nsometimes the New York-St. Louis expresses that would come over the\nfield broadcasting the emergency signal. But always the people were\nrevived with little difficulty, and each time more of the stock of\n\"Piracy, Inc.\" was accumulated. The Air Guard seemed helpless. Time and\ntime again the Pirate slipped in undetected. Each time he convinced\nthem that it was an outside job, for the door was always sealed from the\noutside.\n\n\"Dick, how do you suppose he gets away with the things he does right\nunder the eyes of those Air Guardsmen? He must have some system; he does\nit every time.\"\n\n\"I have a vague idea,\" Arcot answered. \"I was going to ask you today, if\nyour father would let us take passage on the next liner carrying any\nmoney. I understand the insurance rates have been boosted so high that\nthey don't dare to send any cash by air any more. They've resorted to\nthe slow land routes. Is there any money shipment in sight?\"\n\nMorey shook his head. \"No, but I have something that's just as good, if\nnot better, for our purpose. The other day several men came into Dad's\noffice, to charter a plane to San Francisco, and Dad naturally wondered\nwhy they had been referred to the president of the company. It seems the\ndifficulty was that they wanted to hire the ship so they could be\nrobbed! A large group of medical men and cancer victims were going for\nthe 'treatment'. Each one of the twenty-five hundred going was to bring\nalong one hundred dollars. That meant a total of a quarter of a million\ndollars, which is to be left on the table. They hoped the Pirate would\ngas them and thus cure them! Dad couldn't officially do this, but told\nthem that if there were too many people for the San Francisco express,\ntwo sections would be necessary. I believe they are going on that second\nsection. Only one hundred dollars! A low price for cancer cure!\n\n\"Another thing: Dad asked me to tell you that he'd appreciate your help\nin stopping this ultra-modern pirate. If you go down to see him in the\nmorning, you'll doubtless be able to make the necessary arrangements.\"\n\n\"I'll do so gladly. I wonder, though, if you know more about this than I\ndo. Did they try that C-32L mask on an animal?\"\n\n\"The Pirate was telling the truth. They tried it on a dog and he went to\nsleep forever. But do you have any idea how that gas does all it does?\"\n\nNow Arcot shook his head. \"I don't know what the gas is, but have a lead\non how it works. You may know that carbon monoxide will seep through a\nsolid plate of red-hot steel. That has been known for some three hundred\nyears now, and I have to hand it to this Pirate for making use of it.\nEven in the war of 2075 they didn't find any practical application for\nthe principle. He has just found some gas that induces sleep in very low\nconcentrations, and at the same time is able to penetrate to an even\ngreater extent than carbon monoxide.\"\n\n\"I was wondering how he stores that stuff,\" Morey commented. \"But I\nsuppose he makes it as fast as he uses it, by allowing two or more\nconstituents to react. It might well be simple enough to store them\nseparately, and the air-stream blowing past him would carry the gas\nbehind him, permitting him to lay a stream of it in front of the big\nplane. Is that about it?\"\n\n\"That was about what I had figured. One of the things I want to do when\nI go with that Invalid Special tomorrow is to get some samples for\nanalysis.\"\n\n\"That's a pretty big order, isn't it, Dick? How are you going to handle\nit, or even get it into your apparatus?\"\n\n\"Easily enough as far as getting the sample goes. I have already had\nsome sample bottles made. I have one of them in the lab--excuse me a\nmoment.\" Arcot left the room, to return a few minutes later with a large\naluminum bottle, tightly closed. \"This bottle has been pumped out to a\nvery good vacuum. I then swept it out with helium gas. Then it was\npumped out again. I hope to take this into some gas-filled region, where\nthe gas will be able to leak in, but the air won't. When it comes to\ngoing out again, the gas will have to fight air pressure, and will\nprobably stay in.\"\n\n\"Hope it works. It would help if we knew what we were bucking.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe next morning Arcot had a long conference with President Morey. At\nthe end of it, he left the office, ascended to the roof, and climbed\ninto his small helicopter. He rose to the local traffic level, and\nwaiting his chance, broke into the stream of planes bound for the great\nairfields over in the Jersey district. A few minutes later he landed on\nthe roof of the Transcontinental Airways shops, entered them, and went\nto the office of the Designing Engineer, John Fuller, an old schoolmate.\nThey had been able to help each other before, for Fuller had not paid as\nmuch attention to theoretical physics as he might have, and though he\nwas probably one of the outstanding aeronautical designers, he often\nconsulted Arcot on the few theoretical details that he needed. Probably\nit was Arcot who derived the greatest benefit from this association, for\nthe ability of the designer had many times brought his theoretical\nsuccesses to practical commercial production. Now, however, he was\nconsulting Fuller, because the plane he was to take that afternoon for\nSan Francisco was to be slightly changed for him.\n\nHe stayed in Fuller's office for the better part of an hour, then\nreturned to the roof and thence to his own roof, where Morey junior was\nwaiting for him.\n\n\"Hello, Dick! I heard from Dad that you were going this afternoon, and\ncame over here. I got your note and I have the things fixed up here. The\nplane leaves at one, and it's ten-thirty now. Let's eat lunch and then\nstart.\"\n\nIt was half-past eleven when they reached the flying field. They went\ndirectly to the private office which had been assigned to them aboard\nthe huge plane. It was right next to the mail-room, and through the wall\nbetween the two a small hole had been cut. Directly beneath this hole\nwas a table, on which the two men now set up a small moving picture\ncamera they had brought with them.\n\n\"How many of the gas sample bottles did you bring, Bob?\" asked Arcot.\n\n\"Jackson had only four ready, so I brought those. I think that will be\nenough. Have we got that camera properly placed?\"\n\n\"Everything's O.K., I believe. Nothing to do now but wait.\"\n\nTime passed--then they heard a faint whir; the ventilator machinery had\nstarted. This drew air in from outside, and pumped it up to the\nnecessary pressure for breathing in the ship, no matter what the\nexternal pressure might be. There was a larger pump attached similarly\nto each of the engines to supply it with the necessary oxygen. Any loss\nin power by pumping the air in was made up by the lower back pressure on\nthe exhaust. Now the engines were starting--they could feel the\nmomentary vibration--vibration that would cease as they got under way.\nThey could visualize the airtight door being closed; the portable\nelevator backing off, returning to the field house.\n\nArcot glanced at his watch. \"One o'clock. The starting signal is due.\"\n\nMorey sank back into a comfortable chair. \"Well, now we have a nice long\nwait till we get to San Francisco and back, Dick, but you'll have\nsomething to talk about then!\"\n\n\"I hope so, Bob, and I hope we can return on the midnight plane from San\nFrancisco, which will get us in at nine o'clock tomorrow morning, New\nYork time. I wish you'd go right to your father's office and ask him\nover to our place for supper, and see if Fuller can come too. I think\nwe'll be able to use that molecular controller on this job; it's almost\nfinished, and with it we'll need a good designing engineer. Then our\nlittle movie show will no doubt be of interest!\"\n\nThere was a low rumble that quickly mounted to a staccato roar as the\ngreat propellers began whirling and the engines took up the load. The\nground began to flash behind them; then suddenly, as flying speed was\nreached, there was a slight start, the roaring bark of the engine took\non a deeper tone, the rocking stopped and the ground dropped away. Like\nsome mighty wild bird, the plane was in the air, a graceful, sentient\nthing, wheeling in a great circle as it headed for San Francisco. Now\nthe plane climbed steadily in a long bank; up, up, up she went, and\ngradually the terrific roar of the engine died to a low throbbing hum as\nthe low pressure of the air silenced the noise.\n\nBelow them the giant city contracted as the great ship rode higher. The\ntiny private helicops were darting about below them like streams of nigh\ninvisible individuals, creeping black lines among the buildings of the\ncity. The towering buildings shone in the noon sun in riotous hues as\nthe colored tile facing reflected the brilliant sunlight with glowing\nwarmth of color.\n\nIt was a city of indescribable beauty now. It was one of the things that\nmade this trip worthwhile.\n\nNow the shining city dropped behind them, and only the soft green of the\nJersey hills, and the deep purple-black of the sky above were visible.\nThe sun blazed high in the nigh-black heavens, and in the rarefied air,\nthere was so little diffusion that the corona was readily visible with\nthe aid of a smoked glass. Around the sun, long banners in space, the\nZodiacal light gleamed dimly. Here and there some of the brighter stars\nwinked in the dark sky.\n\nBelow them the landscape swung slowly by. Even to these men who had made\nthe trip dozens of times, the sight was fascinating, inspiring. It was a\nspectacle which had never been visible before the development of these\nsuper-planes. Whole flying observatories had been made that had taken\nphotographs at heights of fifteen miles, where the air was so rarefied\nthat the plane had to travel close to eight hundred miles an hour to\nremain aloft.\n\nAlready ahead of them Arcot and Morey could see the great splotch of\ncolor that was Chicago, the mightiest city of Earth. Situated as it was\nin the heart of the North American continent, with great water and\nground landing facilities and broad plains about it, it made a perfect\nairport. The sea no longer meant much, for it was now only a source of\npower, recreation and food. Ships were no longer needed. Planes were\nfaster and more economical; hence seacoast cities had declined in\nimportance. With its already great start toward ascendancy, Chicago had\nrapidly forged ahead, as the air lines developed with the great\nsuper-planes. The European planes docked here, and it was the starting\npoint of the South American lines. But now, as they swung high above it,\nthe glistening walls of soft-colored tiles made it a great mass of\nchanging, flashing color beneath them. Now they could see a great air\nliner, twice the size of their plane, taking off for Japan, its six\ngiant propellers visible only as flashing blurs as it climbed up toward\nthem. Then it was out of sight.\n\nIt was over the green plains of Nebraska that the Pirate usually worked,\nso there the men became more and more alert, waiting for the first sign\nof abnormal drowsiness. They sat quietly, not talking, listening\nintently for some new note, but knowing all the while that any sound the\nPirate might make would be concealed by the whirring roar of the air\nsweeping past the giant airfoils of the plane.\n\nSuddenly Arcot realized he was unbearably sleepy. He glanced drowsily\ntoward Morey who was already lying down. He found it a tremendous effort\nof the will to make himself reach up and close the switch that started\nthe little camera whirring almost noiselessly. It seemed he never pulled\nhis arm back--he just--lay there--and--\n\nA white uniformed man was bending over him as he opened his eyes. To one\nside of him he saw Morey smiling down at him.\n\n\"You're a fine guard, Arcot. I thought you were going to stay awake and\nwatch them!\"\n\n\"Oh, no, I left a much more efficient watchman! _It_ didn't go to\nsleep--I'm willing to bet!\"\n\n\"No, it may not have gone to sleep, but the doctor here tells me it has\ngone somewhere else. It wasn't found in our room when we woke up. I\nthink the Pirate found it and confiscated it. All our luggage, including\nthe gas sample bottles, is gone.\"\n\n\"That's all right. I arranged for that. The ship was brought down by an\nemergency pilot and he had instructions from father. He took care of the\nluggage so that no member of the pirate's gang could steal it. There\nmight have been some of them in the ground crew. They'll be turned over\nto us as soon as we see the emergency man. I don't have to lie here any\nlonger, do I, doctor?\"\n\n\"No, Dr. Arcot, you're all right now. I would suggest that for the next\nhour or so you take it easy to let your heart get used to beating again.\nIt stopped for some two hours, you know. You'll be all right, however.\"\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nFive men were seated about the Morey library, discussing the results of\nthe last raid, in particular as related to Arcot and Morey. Fuller, and\nPresident Morey, as well as Dr. Arcot, senior, and the two young men\nthemselves, were there. They had consistently refused to tell what their\ntrip had revealed, saying that pictures would speak for them. Now they\nturned their attention to a motion picture projector and screen that\nArcot junior had just set up. At his direction the room was darkened;\nand he started the projector. At once they were looking at the three\ndimensional image of the mail-room aboard the air liner.\n\nArcot commented: \"I have cut out a lot of useless film, and confined the\npicture to essentials. We will now watch the pirate at work.\"\n\nEven as he spoke they saw the door of the mail-room open a bit, and\nthen, to their intense surprise, it remained open for a few seconds,\nthen closed. It went through all the motions of opening to admit\nsomeone, yet no one entered!\n\n\"Your demonstration doesn't seem to show much yet, son. In fact, it\nshows much less than I had expected,\" said the senior Arcot. \"But that\ndoor seemed to open easily. I thought they locked them!\"\n\n\"They did, but the pirate just burned holes in them, so to save property\nthey leave 'em unlocked.\"\n\nNow the scene seemed to swing a bit as the plane hit an unusually bad\nair bump, and through the window they caught a glimpse of one of the\ncircling Air Guardsmen. Then suddenly there appeared in the air within\nthe room a point of flame. It hung in the air above the safe for an\ninstant, described a strangely complicated set of curves; then, as it\nhung for an instant in mid-air, it became a great flare. In an instant\nthis condensed to a point of intensely brilliant crimson fire. This\ndescribed a complex series of curves and touched the top of the safe. In\nan inconceivably short time, the eight-inch thickness of tungsto-iridium\nalloy flared incandescently and began to flow sluggishly. A large circle\nof the red flame sprang out to surround the point of brilliance, and\nthis blew the molten metal to one side, in a cascade of sparks.\n\nIn moments, the torch had cut a large disc of metal nearly free;\nseemingly on the verge of dropping into the safe. Now the flame left the\nsafe, again retracting itself in that uncanny manner, no force seeming\neither to supply it with fuel or to support it thus, though it burned\nsteadily, and worked rapidly and efficiently. Now, in mid-air, it hung\nfor a second.\n\n\"I'm going to work the projector for a few moments by hand so that you\nmay see this next bit of film.\" Arcot moved a small switch and the\nmachine blinked, giving a strange appearance to the seemingly solid\nimages that were thrown on the screen.\n\nThe pictures seemed to show the flame slowly descending till it again\ntouched the metal. The tungsto-iridium glowed briefly; then, as suddenly\nas the extinguishing of a light, the safe was gone! It had disappeared\ninto thin air! Only the incandescence of the metal and the flame itself\nwere visible.\n\n\"It seems the pirate has solved the secret of invisibility. No wonder\nthe Air Guardsmen couldn't find him!\" exclaimed Arcot, senior.\n\nThe projector had been stopped exactly on the first frame, showing the\ninvisibility of the safe. Then Arcot backed it up.\n\n\"True, Dad,\" he said, \"but pay special attention to this next frame.\"\n\nAgain there appeared a picture of the room, the window beyond, the mail\nclerk asleep at his desk, everything as before, except that where the\nsafe had been, _there was a shadowy, half visible safe_, the metal\nglowing brightly. Beside it there was visible a shadowy man, holding\nthe safe with a shadowy bar of some sort. And through both of them the\nframe of the window was perfectly visible, and, ironically, an Air\nGuardsman plane.\n\n\"It seems that for an instant his invisibility failed here. Probably it\nwas the contact with the safe that caused it. What do you think, Dad?\"\nasked Arcot, junior.\n\n\"It does seem reasonable. I can't see off-hand how his invisibility is\neven theoretically possible. Have you any ideas?\"\n\n\"Well, Dad, I have, but I want to wait till tomorrow night to\ndemonstrate them. Let's adjourn this meeting, if you can all come\ntomorrow.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe next evening, however, it seemed that it was Arcot himself who could\nnot be there. He asked Morey, junior, to tell them he would be there\nlater, when he had finished in the lab.\n\nDinner was over now, and the men were waiting rather impatiently for\nArcot to come. They heard some noise in the corridor, and looked up, but\nno one entered.\n\n\"Morey,\" asked Fuller, \"what did you learn about that gas the pirate was\nusing? I remember Arcot said he would have some samples to analyze.\"\n\n\"As to the gas, Dick found out but little more than we had already\nknown. It is a typical organic compound, one of the metal radical type,\nand contains one atom of thorium. This is a bit radioactive, as you\nknow, and Dick thinks that this may account in part for its ability to\nsuspend animation. However, since it was impossible to determine the\nmolecular weight, he could not say what the gas was, save that the\nempirical formula was C_{62}TH H_{39}O_{27}N_{5}. It broke down at a\ntemperature of only 89\u00b0 centigrade. The gases left consisted largely of\nmethane, nitrogen, and methyl ether. Dick is still in the dark as to\nwhat the gas is.\" He paused, then exclaimed: \"Look over there!\"\n\nThe men turned with one accord toward the opposite end of the room,\nlooked, and seeing nothing particularly unusual, glanced back rather\npuzzled. What they then saw, or better, failed to see, puzzled them\nstill more. Morey had disappeared!\n\n\"Why--why where--ohhh! Quick work, Dick!\" The senior Arcot began\nlaughing heartily, and as his astonished and curious companions looked\ntoward him, he stopped and called out, \"Come on, Dick! We want to see\nyou now. And tell us how it's done! I rather think Mr. Morey here--I\nmean the visible one--is still a bit puzzled.\"\n\nThere was a short laugh from the air--certainly there could be nothing\nelse there--then a low but distinct click, and both Morey and Arcot were\nmiraculously present, coming instantaneously from nowhere, if one's\nsenses could be relied on. On Arcot's back there was strapped a large\nand rather hastily wired mechanism--one long wire extending from it out\ninto the laboratory. He was carrying a second piece of apparatus,\nsimilarly wired. Morey was touching a short metal bar that Arcot held\nextended in his hand, using a table knife as a connector, lest they get\nradio frequency burns on making contact.\n\n\"I've been busy getting the last connection of this portable apparatus\nrigged up. I have the thing in working order, as you see--or rather,\ndidn't see. This other outfit here is the thing that is more important\nto us. It's a bit heavy, so if you'll clear a space, I'll set it down.\nLook out for my power supply there--that wire is carrying a rather\ndangerously high E.M.F. I had to connect with the lab power supply to do\nthis, and I had no time to rig up a little mechanism like the one the\npirate must have.\n\n\"I have duplicated his experiment. He has simply made use of a principle\nknown for some time, but as there was no need for it, it hasn't been\nused. It was found back in the early days of radio, as early as the\nfirst quarter of the twentieth century, that very short wavelengths\neffected peculiar changes in metals. It was shown that the plates of\ntubes working on very short waves became nearly transparent. The waves\nwere so short, however, that they were economically useless. They would\nnot travel in usable paths, so they were never developed. Furthermore,\nexisting apparatus could not be made to handle them. In the last war\nthey tried to apply the idea for making airplanes invisible, but they\ncould not get their tubes to handle the power needed, so they had to\ndrop it. However, with the tube I recently got out on the market, it is\npossible to get down there. Our friend the pirate has developed this\nthing to a point were he could use it. You can see that invisibility,\nwhile interesting, and a good thing for a stage and television\nentertainment, is not very much of a commercial need. No one wants to be\ninvisible in any honest occupation. Invisibility is a tremendous weapon\nin war, so the pirate just started a little private war, the only way he\ncould make any money on his invention. His gas, too, made the thing\nattractive. The two together made a perfect combination for criminal\noperations.\n\n\"The whole thing looks to me to be the work of a slightly unbalanced\nmind. He is not violently insane; probably just has this one particular\nobsession. His scientific bump certainly shows no sign of weakness. He\nmight even be some new type of kleptomaniac. He steals things, and he\nhas already stolen far more than any man could ever have any need of,\nand he leaves in its place a 'stock' certificate in his own company. He\nis not violent, for hasn't he carefully warned the men not to use the\nC-32L mask? You'll remember his careful instructions as to how to revive\nthe people!\n\n\"He has developed this machine for invisibility, and naturally he can\nfly in and out of the air guard, without their knowing he's there,\nprovided their microphonic detectors don't locate him. I believe he uses\nsome form of glider. He can't use an internal combustion engine, for the\nexplosions in the cylinders would be as visible as though the cylinders\nwere made of clear quartz. He cannot have an electric motor, for the\nstorage cells would weigh too much. Furthermore, if he were using any\nsort of prop, or a jet engine, the noise would give him away. If he used\na glider, the noise of the big plane so near would be more than enough\nto kill the slight sounds. The glider could hang above the ship, then\ndive down upon it as it passed beneath. He has a very simple system of\nanchoring the thing, as I discovered to my sorrow. It's a powerful\nelectro-magnet which he turns on when he lands. The landing deck of the\nbig plane was right above our office aboard, and I found my watch was\ndoing all sorts of antics today. It lost an hour this morning, and this\nafternoon it gained two. I found it was very highly magnetized--I could\npick up needles with the balance wheel. I demagnetized it; now it runs\nall right.\n\n\"But to get back, he anchors his ship, then, leaving it invisible, he\ngoes to the air lock, and enters. He wears a high altitude suit, and on\nhis back he has a portable invisibility set and the fuel for his torch.\nThe gas has already put everyone to sleep, so he goes into the ship,\nstill invisible, and melts open the safe.\n\n\"His power supply for the invisibility machine seems to be somewhat of a\nproblem, but I think I would use a cylinder of liquid air, and have a\nsmall air turbine to run a high voltage generator. He probably uses the\nsame system on a larger scale to run his big machine on the ship. He\ncan't use an engine for that either.\n\n\"That torch of his is interesting, too. We have had atomic hydrogen\nwelding for some time, and atomic hydrogen releases some 100,000\ncalories per mole of molecular hydrogen; two grains of gas give one\nhundred thousand calories. Oxygen has not been prepared in any\ncommercial quantity in the atomic state. From watching that man's torch,\nfrom the color of the flame and other indications, I gather that he uses\na flame of atomic oxygen-atomic hydrogen for melting, and surrounds it\nwith a preheating jacket of atomic hydrogen. The center flame probably\ndevelops a temperature of some 4000\u00b0 centigrade, and will naturally make\nthat tungsten alloy run like water.\n\n\"As to the machine here--it is, as I said, a machine which impresses\nvery high frequencies on the body it is connected with. This puts the\nmolecules in vibration at a frequency approaching that of light, and\nwhen the light impinges upon it, it can pass through readily. You know\nthat metals transmit light for short distances, but in order that the\nlight pass, the molecules of metal must be set in harmonic vibration at\na rate approaching the frequency of light. If we can impress such a\nvibration on a piece of matter, it will then transmit light very freely.\nIf we impress this vibration on the matter, say the body, electrically,\nwe get the same effect and the body becomes perfectly transparent. Now,\nsince it is the vibration of the molecules that makes the light pass\nthrough the material, it must be stopped if we wish to see the machine.\nObviously it is much easier to detect me here among solid surroundings,\nthan in the plane high in the sky. What chance has one to detect a\nmachine that is perfectly transparent when there is nothing but\nperfectly transparent air around it? It is a curious property of this\nvibrational system of invisibility that the index of refraction is made\nvery low. It is not the same as that of air, but the difference is so\nslight that it is practically within the limits of observation error; so\nsmall is the difference that there is no 'rainbow' effect. The\ndifference of temperature of the air would give equal effect.\n\n\"Now, since this vibration is induced by radio impulse, is it not\npossible to impress another, opposing radio impulse, that will overcome\nthis tendency and bring the invisible object into the field of the\nvisible once more? It is; and this machine on the table is designed to\ndo exactly that. It is practically a beam radio set, projecting a beam\nof a wavelength that alone would tend to produce invisibility. But in\nthis case it will make me visible. I'm going to stand right here, and\nBob can operate that set.\"\n\nArcot strode to the middle of the room, and then Morey turned the\nreflector of the beam set on him. There was a low snap as Arcot turned\non his set, then he was gone, as suddenly as the coming of darkness when\na lamp is extinguished. He was there one moment, then they were staring\nat the chair behind him, knowing that the man was standing between them\nand it and knowing that they were looking through his body. It gave them\na strange feeling, an uncomfortable tingling along the spine. Then the\nvoice--it seemed to come from the air, or some disembodied ghost as the\ninvisible man called to Morey.\n\n\"All right, Bob, turn her on slowly.\"\n\nThere was another snap as the switch of the disrupter beam was turned\non. At once there was a noticeable fogginess in the air where Arcot had\nbeen. As more and more power was turned into the machine, they saw the\nman materialize out of thin air. First he was a mere shadowy outline\nthat was never fully above the level of conscious vision. Then slowly\nthe outlines of the objects behind became dimmer and dimmer, as the body\nof the man was slowly darkened, till at last there was only a wavering\naura about him. With a snap Morey shut off his machine and Arcot was\ngone again. A second snap and he was solid before them. He had shut off\nhis apparatus too.\n\n\"You can see now how we intend to locate our invisible pirate. Of course\nwe will depend on directional radio disturbance locating devices to\ndetermine the direction for the invisibility disrupter ray. But you are\nprobably marvelling at the greatness of the genius who can design and\nconstruct this apparatus all in one day. I will explain the miracle. I\nhave been working on short wave phenomena for some time. In fact, I had\nactually made an invisibility machine, as Morey will testify, but I\nrealized that it had no commercial benefits, so I didn't experiment with\nit beyond the laboratory stunt stage. I published some of the theory in\nthe Journal of the International Physical Society--and I wouldn't be\nsurprised to learn that the pirate based his discovery on my report.\n\n\"I am still working on a somewhat different piece of apparatus that I\nbelieve we will find very relevant to this business. I'll ask you to\nadjourn after tonight's meeting for another twenty-four hours till I can\nfinish the apparatus I am working on. It is very important that you be\nhere, Fuller. I am going to need you in the work to follow. It will be\nanother problem of design if this works out, as I hope it will.\"\n\n\"I'll certainly make every effort to be here, Arcot,\" Fuller assured\nhim.\n\n\"I can promise you a tough problem as well as an interesting one.\" Arcot\nsmiled. \"If the thing works, as I expect it to, you'll have a job that\nwill certainly be a feather for your cap. Also it will be a change.\"\n\n\"Well, with that inducement, I'll certainly be here. But I think that\npirate could give us some hints on design. How does he get his glider\nten miles up? They've done some high-altitude gliding already. The\ndistance record took someone across the Atlantic in 2009, didn't it? But\nit seems that ten miles straight up is a bit too steep for a glider.\nThere are no vertical air currents at that height.\"\n\n\"I meant to say that his machine is not a true glider, but a\nsemi-glider. He probably goes up ten miles or more with the aid of a\nsmall engine, one so small it probably takes him half a day to get\nthere. And it would be easy for a plane to pass through the lower\ntraffic lanes, then, being invisible, mount high and wait for the air\nliner. He can't use a very large engine, for it would drag him down, but\none of the new hundred horsepower jobs would weigh only about fifty\npounds. I think we can draw a pretty good picture of his plane from\nscientific logic. It probably has a tremendous wingspread and a very\nhigh angle of incidence to make it possible to glide at that height, and\nthe engine and prop will be almost laughably small.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe next evening the men got together for dinner, and there was\nconsiderable speculation as to the nature of the discovery that Arcot\nwas going to announce, for even his father had no knowledge of what it\nwas. The two men worked in separate laboratories, except when either had\na particularly difficult problem that might be solved by the other. All\nknew that the new development lay in the field of short wave research,\nbut they could not find out in what way it concerned the problem in\nhand.\n\nAt last the meal was over, and Arcot was ready to demonstrate.\n\n\"Dad, I believe that you have been trying to develop a successful solar\nengine. One that could be placed in the wings of a plane to generate\npower from the light falling on that surface. In all solar engines what\nis the greatest problem to be solved?\"\n\n\"Well, the more I investigate the thing, the more I wonder which is the\ngreatest. There are a surprising number of annoying problems to be met.\nI should say, though, that the one big trouble with all solar engines,\neliminating the obvious restriction that they decidedly aren't\ndependable for night work, is the difficulty of getting an area to\nabsorb the energy. If I could get enough area, I could use a very low\nefficiency and still have cheap power, for the power is absolutely free.\nThe area problem is the greatest difficulty, no doubt.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Arcot junior said quietly, \"I think you have a fairly good area\nto use, if you can only harness the energy it absorbs. I have really\ndeveloped a very efficient solar engine. The engine itself requires no\nabsorbing area, as I want to use it; it takes advantage of the fact that\nthe Earth is absorbing quintillions of horsepower. I have merely tapped\nthe power that the Earth has already absorbed for me. Come here.\"\n\nHe led the way down the corridor to his laboratory, and switched on the\nlights. On the main laboratory bench was set up a complicated apparatus\nof many tubes and heavy bus bar connectors. From the final tube two thin\nwires ran to a long tubular coil. To the left of this coil was a large\nrelay switch, and a rheostat control.\n\n\"Turn on the relay, Dad, then slowly rotate the controller to the left.\nAnd remember that it is rather powerful; I know this doesn't look like a\nsolar engine, and nine o'clock at night seems a peculiar hour to\ndemonstrate such a thing, but I'll guarantee results--probably more than\nyou expect.\"\n\nDr. Arcot stepped up to the controls and closed the switch. The lights\ndimmed a bit, but immediately brightened again, and from the other end\nof the room came a low, steady hum as the big transformer took up the\nload.\n\n\"Well, from the sound of that ten K.W. transformer there, if this engine\nis very efficient we ought to get a terrific amount of power out of it.\"\nDr. Arcot was smiling amusedly at his son. \"I can't very well control\nthis except by standing directly in front of it, but I suppose you know\nwhat you're doing.\"\n\n\"Oh, this is a laboratory model, and I haven't gotten the thing into\nshape really. Look at the conductors that lead to the coil; they\ncertainly aren't carrying ten K.W.\"\n\nDr. Arcot slowly rotated the rheostat. There was a faint hum from the\ncoil; then it was gone. There seemed to be no other result. He rotated\nit a bit more; a slight draught sprang up within the room. He waited,\nbut when nothing more startling occurred, he gave the rheostat a sharp\nturn. This time there was absolutely no doubt as to the result. There\nwas a roar like a fifty-foot wind tunnel, and a mighty blast of cold air\nswept out of that coil like a six-inch model of a Kansas cyclone. Every\nloose piece of paper in the laboratory came suddenly alive and whirled\nmadly before the blast of air that had suddenly leaped out. Dr. Arcot\nwas forced back as by a giant hand; in his backward motion his hand was\nlifted from the relay switch, and with a thud the circuit opened. In an\ninstant the roar of sound was cut off, and only a soft whisper of air\ntold of the furious blast that had been there a moment before.\n\nThe astonished physicist came forward and looked at the device a moment\nin silence, while each of the other men watched him. Finally he turned\nto his son, who was smiling at him with a twinkle in his eye.\n\n\"Dick, I think you have 'loaded the dice' in a way that is even more\nlucrative than any other method ever invented! If the principle of this\nmachine is what I think it is, you have certainly solved the secret of a\nsufficiently absorbing area for a solar engine.\"\n\n\"Well,\" remarked the elderly Morey, shivering a bit in the chill air of\nthe room, \"loaded dice have long been noted for their ability to make\nmoney, but I don't see how that explains that working model of an Arctic\ntornado. _Burr_ it's still too cold in here. I think he'll need\nconsiderable area for heat absorption from the sun, for that engine\ncertainly does cool things down! What's the secret?\"\n\n\"The principle is easy enough, but I had considerable difficulty with\nthe application. I think it is going to be rather important though--\"\n\n\"Rather important,\" broke in the inventor's father, with a rare display\nof excitement. \"It will be considerably more than that. It's the biggest\nthing since the electric dynamo! It puts airplanes in the junk heap! It\nmeans a new era in power generation. Why, we'll never have to worry\nabout power! It will make interplanetary travel not only possible, but\ncommercially economical.\"\n\nArcot junior grinned broadly. \"Dad seems to think the machine has\npossibilities! Seriously, I believe it will antiquate all types of\nairplanes, prop or jet. It's a direct utilization of the energy that the\nsun is kindly supplying. For a good many years now men have been trying\nto find out how to control the energy of atoms for air travel, or to\nrelease the energy of the constitution of matter.\n\n\"But why do it at all? The sun is doing it already, and on a scale so\ngargantuan that we could never hope nor desire to approach it. Three\nmillion tons of matter go into that colossal furnace every second of\ntime, and out of that comes two and a half decillion ergs of energy.\nWith a total of two and a half million billion billion billions of ergs\nto draw on, man will have nothing to worry about for a good many years\nto come! That represents a flood of power vaster than man could\ncomprehend. Why try to release any more energy? We have more than we can\nuse; we may as well tap that vast ocean of power.\n\n\"There is one thing that prevents us getting it out, the law of\nprobability. That's why Dad mentioned loaded dice, for dice, as you\nknow, are the classical example of probability when they aren't loaded.\nOnce they are loaded, the law still holds, but the conditions are now so\nchanged that it will make the problem quite different.\"\n\nArcot paused, frowning, then resumed half apologetically, \"Excuse the\nlecture--but I don't know how else to get the thought across. You are\nfamiliar with the conditions in a liter of helium gas in a container--a\ntremendous number of molecules, each dashing along at several miles a\nsecond, and an equal number dashing in the opposite direction at an\nequal speed. They are so thickly packed in there, that none of them can\ngo very far before it runs into another molecule and bounces off in a\nnew direction. How good is the chance that all the molecules should\nhappen to move in the same direction at the same time? One of the old\nphysicists of Einstein's time, a man named Eddington, expressed it very\nwell:\n\n    'If an army of monkeys were playing on typewriters they\n    might write all the books in the British Museum. The\n    chance of their doing so is decidedly more favorable\n    than the chance that all the molecules in a liter of\n    gas should move in the same direction at the same\n    time.'\n\nThe very improbability of this chance is the thing that is making our\nproblem appear impossible.\n\n\"But similarly it would be improbable--impossible according to the law\nof chance--to throw a string of aces indefinitely. It is\nimpossible--unless some other force influences the happening. If the\ndice have bits of iridium stuck under the six spots, they will throw\naces. Chance makes it impossible to have all the molecules of gas move\nin the same direction at the same time--unless we stack the chances. If\nwe can find some way to influence them, they may do so.\n\n\"What would happen to a metal bar if all the molecules in it decided to\nmove in the same direction at the same time? Their heat motion is\nnormally carrying them about at a rate of several miles a second, and if\nnow we have them all go in one way, the entire bar must move in that\ndirection, and it will start off at a velocity as great as the velocity\nof the individual molecules. But now, if we attach the bar to a heavy\ncar, it will try to start off, but will be forced to drag the car with\nit, and so will not be able to have its molecules moving at the same\nrate. They will be slowed down in starting the mass of the car. But\nslowly moving molecules have a definite physical significance. Molecules\nmove because of temperature, and lack of motion means lack of heat.\nThese molecules that have been slowed down are then cold; they will\nabsorb heat from the air about them, and since the molecule of hydrogen\ngas at room temperature is moving at about seven miles a second, when\nthe molecules of the confined gas in our car, or the molecules of the\nmetal bar are slowed down to but a few hundred miles an hour, their\ntemperature drops to some hundreds of degrees below zero, and they\nabsorb energy very rapidly, for the greater the difference in\ntemperature, the greater the rate of heat absorption.\n\n\"I believe we will be able to accelerate the car rapidly to a speed of\nseveral miles a second at very high altitudes, and as we will be able to\nuse a perfectly enclosed streamlined car, we should get tremendous\nspeeds. We'll need no wings, of course, for with a small unit pointed\nvertically, we'll be able to support the car in the air. It will make\npossible a machine that will be able to fly in reverse and so come to a\nquick stop. It will steer us or it will supply us with electrical power,\nfor we merely have to put a series of small metal bars about the\ncircumference of the generator, and get a tremendously powerful engine.\n\n\"For our present need, it means a tremendously powerful engine--and one\nthat we can make invisible.\n\n\"I believe you can guess the source of that breeze we had there? It\nwould make a wonderful air-conditioning unit.\"\n\n\"Dick Arcot,\" began Morey, his voice tight with suppressed excitement,\n\"I would like to be able to use this invention. I know enough of the\neconomics of the thing, if not its science, to know that the apparatus\nbefore us is absolutely invaluable. I couldn't afford to buy the rights\non it, but I want to use it if you'll let me. It means a new era in\ntranscontinental air travel!\"\n\nHe turned sharply to Fuller. \"Fuller, I want you to help Arcot with the\nship to chase the Pirate. You'll get the contract to design the new\nairliners. Hang the cost. It'll run into billions--but there will be no\nmore fuel bills, no oil bills, and the cost of operation will be\nnegligible. Nothing but the Arcot short wave tubes to buy--and each one\ngood for twenty-five thousand hours service!\"\n\n\"You'll get the rights on this if you want them, of course,\" said Arcot\nquietly. \"You're maintaining these laboratories for me, and your son\nhelped me work it out. But if Fuller can move over here tomorrow, it\nwill help things a lot. Also I'd like to have some of your best\nmechanics to make the necessary machines, and to start the power units.\"\n\n\"It's done,\" Morey snapped.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nEarly the next morning Fuller moved his equipment over to the laboratory\nand set up his table for work. There Arcot and Morey joined him, and the\ndesigning of the new machine was started.\n\n\"First, let's get some idea of the most advisable shape,\" Fuller began\nmethodically. \"We'll want it streamlined, of course; roughly speaking, a\ncylinder modified to fit the special uses to which it will be put. But\nyou probably have a general plan in mind, Arcot. Suppose you sketch it\nfor us.\"\n\nThe big physicist frowned thoughtfully. \"Well, we don't know much about\nthis yet, so we'll have to work it out. You'll have plenty of fun\nfiguring out strains in this machine, so let's be safe and use a factor\nof safety of five. Let's see what we'll need.\n\n\"In the first place, our machine must be proof against the Pirate's gas,\nfor we won't be riding a beam with instruments to guide us safely, if we\npass out. I've thought that over, and I think that the best system is\njust what we used in the sample bottles--a vacuum. His gas is stopped by\nnothing, so to speak, but there is no substance that will stop it! It\nwill no doubt penetrate the outer shell, but on reaching the vacuum, it\nwill tend to stay there, between the inner and outer walls. Here it will\ncollect, since it will be fighting air pressure in going either in or\nout. The pressure inside will force it back, and the pressure outside\nwill force it in. If we did not pump it out, it would soon build up\npressure enough to penetrate the interior wall. Now, since the stuff can\nleak through any material, what kind of a pump shall we use? It won't be\npushed by a piston, for it will leak through either the cylinder walls\nor the piston. A centrifugal pump would be equally ineffective. A\nmercury vapor pump will take it out, of course, and keep a high vacuum,\nbut we'd never make any progress.\n\n\"Our new machine gives us the answer. With it we can just have a number\nof openings in the wall of the outer shell, and set in them one of these\nmolecular motion directors, and direct the molecules into the outside\nair. They can't come in through it, and they will go out!\"\n\n\"But,\" Morey objected, \"the vacuum that keeps out the gas will also keep\nout heat, as well! Since our generator is to run on heat energy, it will\nbe rather chilly inside if we don't remedy that. Of course, our power\nunits could be placed outside, where the blast of air will warm them,\nbut we really won't have a very good streamline effect if we hang a big\nelectric generator outside.\"\n\n\"I've thought of that too,\" Arcot answered. \"The solution is obvious--if\nwe can't bring the generator to the air, we must bring the air to it.\"\nHe began sketching rapidly on the pad before him, \"We'll have all the\npower equipment in this room here in the back, and the control room up\nin front, here. The relays for controlling will be back here, so we can\ncontrol electrically the operation of the power equipment from our warm,\ngas-tight room. If it gets too warm in there, we can cool it by using a\nlittle of the heat to help accelerate the ship. If it is too cold, we\ncan turn on an electric heater run by the generator. The air for the\ngenerator can come in through a small sort of scoop on top, and leave\nthrough a small opening in the rear. The vacuum at the tail will assure\nus a very rapid circulation, even if the centrifugal pump action of the\nenclosed generator isn't enough.\"\n\nHis thoughts began moving more rapidly than his words. \"We'll want the\ngenerator greatly over power to run tests over a greater range. Won't\nneed more than one hundred kilowatts altogether, but should install\nabout a thousand--A.C., of course. Batteries in the keel for starting\nthe generator.... Self-supporting when it's rolling....\n\n\"But let's set down some actual figures on this.\"\n\nFor the rest of the day the three men were working on the general plan\nof the new ship, calculating the strengths needed, supplementing\nmathematics with actual experiments with the machines on hand. The\ncalculating machines were busy continuously, for there were few rules\nthat experience could give them. They were developing something entirely\nnew, and though they were a designing staff of three of the foremost\nmathematicians in the world, it was a problem that tested their\ningenuity to the utmost.\n\nBy the evening of the first day, however, they had been able to give the\nfinished designs for the power units to the mechanics who were to make\nthem. The order for the storage battery and the standard electrical\nequipment had been placed at once. By the time they had completed the\ndrawings for the mail casting, the materials were already being\nassembled in a little private camp that Morey owned, up in the hills of\nVermont. The giant freight helicopters could land readily in the wide\nfield that had been cleared on the small plateau, in the center of which\nnestled a little blue lake and a winding trout brook.\n\nThe mechanics and electrical engineers had been sent up there\nalready--officially on vacation. The entire program could be carried out\nwithout attracting the least attention, for such orders from the great\nTranscontinental lines were so frequent that no importance was attached\nto them.\n\nFour days after the final plans had been completed the last of the\nsupplies were being assembled in the portable metal shed that was to\nhouse the completed machine. The shining tungsto-steel alloy frame\nmembers were rapidly being welded in place by cathode ray welding\ntorches in the hands of skilled artisans.\n\nAlready at the other end of the shop the generator had been arranged for\nuse with the molecular motion power units. The many power units to drive\nand support the ship were finished and awaiting installation as the crew\nquit work on the fourth evening. They would be installed on the frame in\nthe morning, and the generator would be hoisted into place with the\nsmall portable crane. The storage batteries were connected, and in place\nin the hull. The great fused quartz windows rested in their cases along\none wall, awaiting the complete application of the steel alloy plates.\nThey were to be over an inch thick, an unnecessary thickness, perhaps,\nbut they had no need to economize weight, as witnessed by their choice\nof steel instead of light metal alloys throughout the construction.\n\nThe three men had arrived late that afternoon in a small helicopter, and\nhad gone directly to the shops to see what progress had been made. They\nhad been forced to remain in New York to superintend the shipment of the\nnecessary supplies to the camp site, and since no trouble was\nanticipated in the making of the steel framework, they had not felt it\nnecessary to come. But now they would be needed to superintend the more\ndelicate work.\n\n\"She's shaping up nicely, isn't she?\" Arcot gazed at the rapidly\nrounding frame with a critical eye. Unhindered as they were by the\ntraditional shapes, by wings or other protuberances, they had been able\nto design a machine of striking beauty. The ship was to retain its\nnatural metallic sheen, the only protection being a coat of \"passivity\npaint\"--a liquid chemical that could be brushed or sprayed on iron,\nchromium, nickel or cobalt alloys, rendering them passive to practically\nall chemical agents. The new \"paint\" left the iron or steel as\nbrilliantly glossy as ever, but overcast with a beautiful iridescence,\nand immune to the most powerful reagents.\n\nThe three men walked around the rapidly growing hull, and looked with\nexcited interest at the heavy welded joints and the great beams. The\nship seemed capable of withstanding a fall of several hundred feet with\nlittle damage. The location of the power units was plainly visible and\neasily recognized, for at each point there came together four or five\ngreat beams, welded into one great mass of tough metal, and in it there\nwere set heavy tungsten bolts that would hold the units in place.\n\nThey inspected each joint minutely for signs of flaws, using a small\nportable X-ray fluoroscope to see the interior of the metal. Each joint\nseemed perfect. They retired, satisfied that everything was ready for\nthe work of the next day.\n\nThe morning began early with a long swim in the lake, and a hearty\nbreakfast of country cured ham and eggs. Then the work on the great\nframework was continued, and that day saw the power units bolted in\nplace, removable if change was thought advisable. Each power unit was\nequipped with long streamlined copper fins lying close to the rounded\nhull, that they might absorb heat more rapidly.\n\nDay by day the structure drew nearer completion, and, with the large\ncrew of highly skilled workers, the craft was practically complete\nwithin a week. Only the instruments remained to be installed. Then at\nlast even these had been put in place, and with the aid of Fuller, Morey\njunior, and his own father, Arcot had connected their many complicated\ncircuits.\n\n\"Son,\" remarked Arcot senior, looking critically at the great\nswitchboard, with its maze of connections, its many rheostats and\ncontrols, and its heavy bus bar connectors behind it, \"no one man can\nkeep an eye on all those instruments. I certainly hope you have a\ngood-sized crew to operate your controls! We've spent two days getting\nall those circuits together, and I'll admit that some of them still have\nme beat. I don't see how you intend to watch all those instruments, and\nat the same time have any idea what's going on outside.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" laughed Arcot junior, \"these aren't intended for constant\nwatching. They're merely helps in a lot of tests I want to make. I want\nto use this as a flying laboratory so I can determine the necessary\npowers and the lowest factor of safety to use in building other\nmachines. The machine is very nearly completed now. All we need is the\nseats--they are to be special air-inflated gyroscopically controlled\nseats, to make it impossible for a sudden twist of the ship to put the\nstrain in the wrong direction. Of course the main gyroscopes will\nbalance the ship laterally, horizontally, and vertically, but each chair\nwill have a separate gyroscopic mounting for safety.\"\n\n\"When do you expect to start after the Pirate?\" Fuller asked.\n\n\"I plan to practice the manipulation of the machine for at least four\ndays,\" Arcot replied, \"before I try to chase the Pirate. I'd ordinarily\nrecommend the greatest haste, but the man has stolen close to ten\nmillion already, and he's still at it. That would not be done by anyone\nin his right mind. I suppose you've heard, the War Department considers\nhis new gas so important that they've obtained a pardon for him on\ncondition they be permitted to have the secret of it. They demand the\nreturn of the money, and I have no doubt he has it. I am firmly\nconvinced that he is a kleptomaniac. I doubt greatly if he will stop\ntaking money before he is caught. Therefore it will be safe to wait\nuntil we can be sure of our ability to operate the machine smoothly. Any\nother course would be suicidal. Also, I am having some of those\ntool-makers make up a special type of molecular motion machine for use\nas a machine gun. The bullets are steel, about three inches long, and as\nthick as my thumb. They will be perfectly streamlined, except for a\nlittle stabilizer at the tail, to guide 'em. They won't spin as a rifle\nbullet does, and so there will be no gyroscopic effect to hold them nose\non, but the streamlining and the stabilizer will keep them on their\ncourse. I expect them to be able to zip right through many inches of\narmour plate, since they will have a velocity of over four miles a\nsecond.\n\n\"They'll be fed in at the rate of about two hundred a minute--faster if\nI wish, and started by a small spring. They will instantly come into the\nfield of a powerful molecular motion director, and will be shot out\nwith terrific speed. It will be the first rifle ever made that could\nshoot bullets absolutely parallel to the ground.\n\n\"But that is all we can do today. The guns will be mounted outside, and\ncontrolled electrically, and the charts will be installed tomorrow. By\nthe day after tomorrow at eight A.M. I plan to take off!\"\n\nThe work the next day was rushed to completion far earlier than Arcot\nhad dared to hope. All the men had been kept isolated at the farm, lest\nthey accidentally spread the news of the new machine. It was with\nexcited interest that they helped the machine to completion. The guns\nhad not been mounted as yet, but that could wait. Mid-afternoon found\nthe machine resting in the great construction shed, completely equipped\nand ready to fly!\n\n\"Dick,\" said Morey as he strode up to him after testing the last of the\ngyroscopic seats, \"she's ready! I certainly want to get her going--it's\nonly three-thirty, and we can go around to the sunlight part of the\nworld when it gets dark at the speeds we can travel. Let's test her\nnow!\"\n\n\"I'm just as anxious to start as you are, Bob. I've sent for a U.S. Air\nInspector. As soon as he comes we can start. I'll have to put an 'X'\nlicense indication on her now. He'll go with us to test it--I hope.\nThere will be room for three other people aboard, and I think you and\nDad and I will be the logical passengers.\"\n\nHe pointed excitedly. \"Look, there's a government helicopter coming.\nTell the men to get the blocks from under her and tow her out. Two power\ntrucks should do it. Get her at least ten feet beyond the end of the\nhangar. We'll start straight up, and climb to at least a five mile\nheight, where we can make mistakes safely. While you're tending to that,\nI'll see if I can induce the Air Inspector to take a trip with us.\"\n\nHalf an hour later the machine had been rolled entirely out of the shed,\non the new concrete runway.\n\nThe great craft was a thing of beauty shimmering in the bright sunlight\nThe four men who were to ride in it on its maiden voyage stood off to\none side gazing at the great gleaming metal hull. The long sweeping\nlines of the sides told a story of perfect streamlining, and implied\nhigh speed, even at rest. The bright, slightly iridescent steel hull\nshone in silvery contrast to the gleaming copper of the power units'\nheat-absorption fins. The great clear windows in the nose and the low,\nstreamlined air intake for the generator seemed only to accentuate the\ngraceful lines of the machine.\n\n\"Lord, she's a beauty, isn't she, Dick!\" exclaimed Morey, a broad smile\nof pleasure on his face.\n\n\"Well, she did shape up nicely on paper, too, didn't she. Oh, Fuller,\ncongratulations on your masterpiece. It's even better looking than we\nthought, now the copper has added color to it. Doesn't she look fast? I\nwish we didn't need physicists so badly on this trip, so you could go on\nthe first ride with us.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's all right, Dick, I know the number of instruments in there,\nand I realize they will mean a lot of work this trip. I wish you all\nluck. The honor of having designed the first ship like that, the first\nheavier-than-air ship that ever flew without wings, jets, or props--that\nis something to remember. And I think it's one of the most beautiful\nthat ever flew, too.\"\n\n\"Well, Dick,\" said his father quietly, \"let's get under way. It should\nfly--but we don't really know that it will!\"\n\nThe four men entered the ship and strapped themselves in the gyroscopic\nseats. One by one they reported ready.\n\n\"Captain Mason,\" Arcot explained to the Air Inspector, \"these seats may\nseem to be a bit more active than one generally expects a seat to be,\nbut in this experimental machine, I have provided all the safety devices\nI could think of. The ship itself won't fall, of that I am sure, but the\npower is so great it might well prove fatal to us if we are not in a\nposition to resist the forces. You know all too well the effect of sharp\nturns at high speed and the results of the centrifugal force. This\nmachine can develop such tremendous power that I have to make provision\nfor it.\n\n\"You notice that my controls and the instruments are mounted on the arm\nof the chair really; that permits me to maintain complete control of the\nship at all times, and still permits my chair to remain perpendicular to\nthe forces. The gyroscopes in the base here cause the entire chair to\nremain stable if the ship rolls, but the chair can continue to revolve\nabout this bearing here so that we will not be forced out of our seats.\nI'm confident that you'll find the machine safe enough for a license.\nShall we start?\"\n\n\"All right, Dr. Arcot,\" replied the Air Inspector. \"If you and your\nfather are willing to try it, I am.\"\n\n\"Ready, Engineer?\" asked Arcot.\n\n\"Ready, Pilot!\" replied Morey.\n\n\"All right--just keep your eye on the meters, Dad, as I turn on the\nsystem. If the instruments back there don't take care of everything, and\nyou see one flash over the red mark--yank open the main circuit. I'll\ncall out what to watch as I turn them on.\"\n\n\"Ready son.\"\n\n\"Main gyroscopes!\" There was a low snap, a clicking of relays in the\nrear compartment, and then a low hum that quickly ran up the scale.\n\"Main generators!\" Again the clicking switch, and the relays thudding\ninto action, again the rising hum. \"Seat-gyroscopes.\" The low click was\nsucceeded by a quick shrilling sound that rose in moments above the\nrange of hearing as the separate seat-gyroscopes took up their work.\n\"Main power tube bank!\" The low hum of the generator changed to a\nmomentary roar as the relays threw on full load. In a moment the\nautomatic controls had brought it up to speed.\n\n\"Everything is working perfectly so far. Are we ready to start now,\nson?\"\n\n\"Main vertical power units!\" The great ship trembled throughout its\nlength as the lift of the power units started. A special instrument had\nbeen set up on the floor beside Arcot, that he might be able to judge\nthe lift of his power units; it registered the apparent weight of the\nship. It had read two hundred tons. Now all eyes were fixed on it, as\nthe pointer dropped quickly to 150-100-75-50-40-20-10--there was a\nclick and the instrument flopped back to 300--it was registering in\npounds now! Then the needle moved to zero, and the mighty structure\nfloated into the air, slowly moving down the field as a breeze carried\nit along the ground.\n\nThe men outside saw it rise swiftly into the sky, straight toward the\nblue vault of heaven. In two or three minutes it was disappearing. The\nglistening ship shrank to a tiny point of light; then it was gone! It\nmust have been rising at fully three hundred miles an hour!\n\nTo the men in the car there had been a tremendous increase in weight\nthat had forced them into the air cushions like leaden masses. Then the\nground fell away with a speed that made them look in amazement. The\nhouse, the construction shed, the lake, all seemed contracting beneath\nthem. So quickly were they rising that they had not time to adjust their\nmental attitude. To them all the world seemed shrinking about them.\n\nNow they were at a tremendous height; over twenty miles they had risen\ninto the atmosphere; the air about them was so thin that the sky seemed\nblack, the stars blazed out in cold, unwinking glory, while the great\nfires of the sun seemed reaching out into space like mighty arms seeking\nto draw back to the parent body the masses of the wheeling planets.\nAbout it, in far flung streamers of cold fire shone the mighty zodiacal\nlight, an Aurora on a titanic scale. For a moment they hung there, while\nthey made readings of the meters.\n\nArcot was the first to speak and there was awe in his voice. \"I never\nbegan to let out the power of this thing! What a ship! When these are\nmade commercially, we'll have to use about one horsepower generators in\nthem, or people will kill themselves trying to see how fast they can\ngo.\"\n\nMethodically the machine was tried out at this height, testing various\nsettings of the instruments. It was definitely proven that the values\nthat Arcot and Morey had assigned from purely theoretical calculations\nwere correct to within one-tenth of one percent. The power absorbed by\nthe machine they knew and had calculated, but the terrific power of the\ndriving units was far beyond their expectations.\n\n\"Well, now we're off for some horizontal maneuvers,\" Arcot announced.\n\"I'm sure we agree the machine can climb and can hold itself in the air.\nThe air pressure controls seem to be working perfectly. Now we'll test\nher speed.\"\n\nSuddenly the seats swung beneath them; then as the ship shot forward\nwith ever greater speed, ever greater acceleration, it seemed that it\nturned and headed upward, although they knew that the main stabilizing\ngyroscopes were holding it level. In a moment the ship was headed out\nover the Atlantic at a speed no rifle bullet had ever known. The radio\nspeedometer needle pushed farther and farther over as the speed\nincreased to unheard of values. Before they left the North American\nshoreline they were traveling faster than a mile a second. They were in\nthe middle of the Atlantic before Arcot gradually shut off the\nacceleration, letting the seats drop back into position.\n\nA hubbub of excited comments rose from the four men. Momentarily, with\nthe full realization of the historical importance of this flight, no one\npaid any attention to anyone else. Finally a question of the Air\nInspector reached Arcot's ears.\n\n\"What speed did we attain, Dr. Arcot? Look--there's the coast of Europe!\nHow fast are we going now?\"\n\n\"We were traveling at the rate of three miles a second at the peak.\"\nArcot answered. \"Now it has fallen to two and a half.\"\n\nAgain Arcot turned his attention to his controls. \"I'm going to try to\nsee what the ultimate ceiling of this machine is. It must have a\nceiling, since it depends on the operation of the generator to operate\nthe power-units. This, in turn, depends on the heat of the air, helped\nsomewhat by the sun's rays. Up we go!\"\n\nThe ship was put into a vertical climb, and steadily the great machine\nrose. Soon, however, the generator began to slow down. The readings of\nthe instruments were dropping rapidly. The temperature of the\nexceedingly tenuous air outside was so close to absolute zero that it\nprovided very little energy.\n\n\"Get up some forward speed,\" Morey suggested, \"so that you'll have the\naid of the air scoop to force the air in faster.\"\n\n\"Right, Morey.\" Arcot slowly applied the power to the forward propulsion\nunits. As they took hold, the ship began to move forward. The increase\nin power was apparent at once. The machine started rising again. But at\nlast, at a height of fifty-one miles, her ceiling had been reached.\n\nThe cold of the cabin became unbearable, for every kilowatt of power\nthat the generator could get from the air outside was needed to run the\npower units. The air, too, became foul and heavy, for the pumps could\nnot replace it with a fresh supply from the near-vacuum outside. Oxygen\ntanks had not been carried on this trip. As the power of the generator\nwas being used to warm the cabin once more, they began to fall. Though\nthe machine was held stable by the gyroscopes, she was dropping freely;\nbut they had fifty miles to fall, and as the resistance of the denser\nair mounted, they could begin to feel the sense of weight return.\n\n\"You've passed, but for the maneuvers, Dr. Arcot!\" The Air Inspector was\ndecidedly impressed. \"The required altitude was passed so long ago--why\nwe are still some miles above it, I guess! How fast are we falling?\"\n\n\"I can't tell unless I point the nose of the ship down, for the\napparatus works only in the direction in which the ship is pointed. Hold\non, everyone, I am going to start using some power to stop us.\"\n\nIt was night when they returned to the little field in Vermont. They had\nestablished a new record in every form of aeronautical achievement\nexcept endurance! The altitude record, the speed record, the speed of\nclimb, the acceleration record--all that Arcot could think of had been\npassed. Now the ship was coming to dock for the night. In the morning it\nwould be out again. But now Arcot was sufficiently expert with the\ncontrols to maneuver the ship safely on the ground. They finally solved\nthe wind difficulty by decreasing the weight of the ship to about fifty\npounds, thus enabling the three men to carry it into the hanger!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe next two days were devoted to careful tests of the power factors of\nthe machine, the best operating frequency, the most efficient altitude\nof operation, and as many other tests as they had time for. Each of the\nthree younger men took turns operating, but so great were the strains of\nthe sudden acceleration, that Arcot senior decided it would be wisest\nfor him to stay on the ground and watch.\n\nIn the meantime reports of the Pirate became fewer and fewer as less and\nless money was shipped by air.\n\nArcot spent four days practicing the manipulation of the machine, for\nthough it handled far more readily than any other craft he had ever\ncontrolled, there was always the danger of turning on too much power\nunder the stress of sudden excitement.\n\nThe night before, Arcot had sailed the ship down and alighted on the\nroof of Morey senior's apartment, leaving enough power on to reduce the\nweight to but ten tons, lest it fall through the roof, while he went\ndown to see the President of the Lines about some \"bait\" for the Pirate.\n\n\"Send some cash along,\" said Arcot, when he saw Morey senior, \"say a\nquarter of a million. Make it more or less public knowledge, and talk it\nup so that the Pirate may think there's a real haul on board. I am going\nto accompany the plane at a height of about a quarter of a mile above. I\nwill try to locate him from there by means of radar, and if I have my\napparatus on, I naturally can't locate him. I hope he won't be scared\naway--but I rather believe he won't. At any rate, you won't lose on the\ntry!\"\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nAgain Morey and Arcot were looking at the great Jersey aerodrome, out on\nthe fields that had been broad marshes centuries before. Now they had\nbeen filled in, and stretched for miles, a great landing field, close to\nthe great city across the river.\n\nThe men in the car above were watching the field, hanging inert, a point\nof glistening metal, high in the deep velvet of the purple sky, for\nfifteen miles of air separated them from the Transcontinental machine\nbelow. Now they saw through their field glasses that the great plane was\nlumbering slowly across the field, gaining momentum as it headed\nwestward into the breeze. Then it seemed to be barely clearing the great\nskyscrapers that towered twenty-four hundred feet into the air, arching\nover four or five city blocks. From this height they were toys made of\ncolored paper, soft colors glistening in the hot noon sunlight, and\naround and about them wove lines of flashing, moving helicopters, the\nindividual lost in the mass of the million or so swiftly moving\nmachines. Only the higher, steadily moving levels of traffic were\nvisible to them.\n\n\"Just look at that traffic! Thousands and thousands coming back into the\ncity after going home to lunch--and every day the number of helicopters\nis increasing! If it hadn't been for your invention of this machine,\nconditions would soon be impossible. The airblast in the cities is\nunbearable now, and getting worse all the time. Many machines can't get\nenough power to hold themselves up at the middle levels; there is a down\ncurrent over one hundred miles an hour at the 400-foot level in downtown\nNew York. It takes a racer to climb fast there!\n\n\"If it were not for gyroscopic stabilizers, they could never live in\nthat huge airpocket. I have to drive in through there. I'm always afraid\nthat somebody with an old worn-out bus will have stabilizer failure and\nwill really smash things.\" Morey was a skillful pilot, and realized, as\nfew others did, the dangers of that downward airblast that the countless\nwhirring blades maintained in a constant roar of air. The office\nbuildings now had double walls, with thick layers of sound absorbing\nmaterials, to stop the roar of the cyclonic blast that continued almost\nunabated twelve hours a day.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know about that, Morey,\" replied Arcot. \"This thing has\nsome drawbacks. Remember that if we had about ten million of these\nmachines hung in the air of New York City, there would be a noticeable\ndrop in the temperature. We'd probably have an Arctic climate year in\nand year out. You know, though, how unbearably hot it gets in the city\nby noon, even on the coldest winter days, due to the heating effect of\nthe air friction of all those thousands of blades. I have known the\ntemperature of the air to go up fifty degrees. There probably will have\nto be a sort of balance between the two types of machines. It will be a\nterrific economic problem, but at the same time it will solve the\ndifficulties of the great companies who have been fermenting grain\nresidues for alcohol. The castor bean growers are also going to bring\ndown their prices a lot when this machine kills the market. They will\nalso be more anxious to extract the carbon from the cornstalks for\nreducing ores of iron and of other metals.\"\n\nAs the ship flew high above the Transcontinental plane, the men\ndiscussed the economic values of the different applications of Arcot's\ndiscoveries from the huge power stations they could make, to the cooling\nand ventilating of houses.\n\n\"Dick, you mentioned the cooling effect on New York City; with the\nmillions on millions of these machines that there will be, with huge\npower plants, with a thousand other different applications in use, won't\nthe terrific drain of energy from the air cause the whole world to\nbecome a little cooler?\" asked Fuller.\n\n\"I doubt it, Bob,\" said Arcot slowly. \"I've thought of that myself.\nRemember that most of the energy we use eventually ends up as heat\nanyway. And just remember the decillions of ergs of energy that the sun\nis giving off! True, we only get an infinitesimal portion of that\nenergy--but what we do get is more than enough for us. Power houses can\nbe established very conveniently in the tropics, where they will cool\nthe air, and the energy can be used to refine metals. That means that\nthe surplus heat of the tropics will find a use. Weather control will\nalso be possible by the direction-control of great winds. We could set\nhuge director tubes on the tops of mountains, and blow the winds in\nwhatever direction best suited us. Not the blown wind itself, but the\nvast volume of air it carried with it, would be able to cool the\ntemperate zones in the summer from the cold of the poles, and warm it in\nwinter with the heat of the tropics.\"\n\nAfter a thoughtful silence, Arcot continued, \"And there is another thing\nit may make possible in the future--a thing that may be hard to accept\nas a commercial proposition. We have a practically inexhaustible source\nof energy now, but we have no sources of minerals that will last\nindefinitely. Copper is becoming more and more rare. Had it not been for\nthe discoveries of the great copper fields of the Sahara and in Alaska,\nwe wouldn't have any now. Platinum is exhausted, and even iron is\nbecoming more and more valuable. We are facing a shortage of metals. Do\nyou realize that within the next two centuries we will be unable to\nmaintain this civilization unless we get new sources of certain basic\nraw materials?\n\n\"But we have one other chance now. The solution is--there are nine\nplanets in this solar system! Neptune and Uranus are each far vaster\nthan Earth; they are utterly impossible for life as we know it, but a\nsmall colony might be established there to refine metals for the distant\nEarth. We might be able to build domed and sealed cities. But first we\ncould try the nearer planets--Mars, Venus, or some satellites such as\nour Moon. I certainly hope that this machine will make it possible.\"\n\nFor some time they sat in silence as they sped along, high above the\ngreen plains of Indiana. Chicago lay like some tremendous jewel far off\non the horizon to the right and ahead. Five miles below them the huge\nbulk of the Transcontinental plane seemed a toy as it swung slowly\nacross the fields--actually traveling over six hundred miles an hour.\nAt last Morey spoke.\n\n\"You're right, Arcot. We'll have to think of the interplanetary aspects\nof this some day. Oh, there's Chicago! We'd better start the vacuum gas\nprotector. And the radar. We may soon see some action.\"\n\nThe three men immediately forgot the somewhat distant danger of the\nmetal shortage. There were a number of adjustments to be made, and these\nwere quickly completed, while the machine forged evenly, steadily ahead.\nThe generator was adjusted to maximum efficiency, and the various tubes\nwere tested separately, for though they were all new, and each good for\ntwenty-five thousand hours, it would be inconvenient, to say the least,\nif one failed while they were in action. Each tested perfect; and they\nknew from the smooth functioning of the various relays that governed the\ngenerator, as the loads on it varied, that it must be working perfectly,\nat something less than one-half maximum rating.\n\nSteadily they flew on, waiting tensely for the first sign of a glow from\nthe tiny neon tube indicator on the panel before Morey.\n\n\"This looks familiar, Dick,\" said Morey, looking about at the fields and\nthe low line of the blue mountains far off on the western horizon. \"I\nthink it was about here that we took our little nap in the 'Flying Wheel\nchair', as the papers called it. It would be about here th-- LOOK! It is\nabout here! Get ready for action, Fuller. You're taking the machine gun,\nI'll work the invisibility disrupter, and Arcot will run the ship. Let's\ngo!\"\n\nOn the board before him the tiny neon tube flickered dully, glowed\nbriefly like a piece of red-hot iron, then went out. In a moment it was\nglowing again, and then quickly its brilliance mounted till it was a\nline of crimson. Morey snapped the switch from the general radar to the\nbeam receiver, that he might locate the machine exactly. It was fully a\nminute before the neon tube flashed into life once more. The pirate was\nflying just ahead of the big plane, very likely gassing them. All\naround him were the Air Guardsmen, unaware that the enemy was so near.\nAs the disrupter beam could be projected only about a mile, they would\nhave to dive down on the enemy at once; an instant later the great plane\nbeneath them seemed to be rushing upward at a terrific speed.\n\nThe two radar beams were kept focused constantly on the Pirate's craft.\nWhen they were about two miles from the two planes, the neon tube blazed\nbrilliantly with a clash of opposing energy. The Pirate was trying to\nmaintain his invisibility, while the rapidly growing strength of the\nmachine above strove to batter it down. In moments the ammeter connected\nwith the disrupter beam began to rise so rapidly that Morey watched it\nwith some concern. Despite the ten-kilowatt set being used to project\nthe beam, the resistance of the apparatus on board the pirate ship was\namazing.\n\nAbruptly the three became aware of a rapidly solidifying cloud before\nthem. The interference of the beam Morey was sending had begun breaking\ndown the molecular oscillation that permitted the light to pass freely\nthrough the pirate's craft. Suddenly there was a circle of blue light\nabout the shadow form, and a moment later the ionized air relapsed into\nnormal condition as the pirate's apparatus broke down under the strain.\nAt once Morey shut off his apparatus, convinced by the sudden change\nthat the pirate's apparatus had blown out. He glanced up quickly as\nArcot called to him, \"Morey--look at him go!\"\n\nToo late. Already the plane had shot off with terrific speed. It had\nflashed up and to their left, at a rate of climb that seemed\nunbelievable--except that the long trail of flaming gas told the story!\nThe plane was propelled by rockets! The terrific acceleration carried it\nout of their range of vision in an instant, and as Arcot swung the ship\nto bring him again within sight of the windows, they gasped, for already\nhe was many miles away.\n\nThere was a terrific wrench as Arcot threw on all the power he dared,\nthen quickly leveled the machine, following the pirate at lightning\nspeed. He increased the acceleration further as the men grew accustomed\nto the force that weighed them down. Ahead of them the pirate was racing\nalong, but quickly now they were overhauling him, for his machine had\nwings of a sort! They produced a tremendous amount of head resistance at\ntheir present velocity, for already the needle of the radio speedometer\nhad moved over to one mile a second. They were following the fleet plane\nahead at the rate of 3600 miles an hour. The roar of the air outside was\na tremendous wave of sound, yet to them, protected by the vacuum of the\ndouble walls, it was detectable only by the vibration of the car.\n\nRapidly the pirate's lead was cut down. It seemed but a moment before he\nwould be within range of their machine gun. Suddenly he nosed down and\nshot for the ground, ten miles below, in a power dive. Instantly Arcot\nswung his machine in a loop that held him close to the tail of the\npirate. The swift maneuvers at this speed were a terrific strain on both\nmen and machines--the acceleration seemed crushing them with the weight\nof four men, as Arcot followed the pirate in a wide loop to the right\nthat ended in a straight climb, the rocket ship standing on its tail,\nthe rocket blast roaring out behind a stream of fire a half mile long.\n\nThe pirate was climbing at a speed that would have distanced any other\nmachine the world had ever seen, but the tenacious opponent behind him\nclung ever tighter to the tiny darting thing. He had released great\nclouds of his animation suspending gas. To his utter surprise, the ship\nbehind him had driven right through it, entirely unaffected! He, who\nknew most about the gas, had been unable to devise a material to stop\nit, a mask or a tank to store it, yet in some way these men had\nsucceeded! And that hurtling, bullet-shaped machine behind! Like some\nminiature airship it was, but with a speed and an acceleration that put\neven his ship to shame! It could twist, turn, dive, rise and shoot off\non the straight-away with more flashing speed than anything aloft. Time\nand again he tried complicated maneuvers that strained him to the\nutmost, yet that machine always followed after him!\n\nThere was one more thing to do. In outer space his rockets would support\nhim. In a straight climb he shot up to the blazing sun above, out into\nspace, while the sky around him grew black, and the stars shone in\nsolemn splendor around him. But he had eyes for only one thing, the\nshining car that was rising with more than equal speed behind him. He\nknew he must be climbing over two thousand miles an hour, yet the\ntracker came ever closer. Just out of sighting range for the machine gun\nnow ... in a moment ... but, she was faltering!\n\nThe men in the machine behind sat white-lipped, tense, as the whirling\nshocks of sudden turns at terrific speed twisted the gyroscopic seats\naround like peas in a rolling ball. Up, down, left, right, the darting\nmachine ahead was twisting with unbelievable speed. Then suddenly the\nnose was pointed for the zenith again, and with a great column of flame\nshooting out behind him, he was heading straight toward space!\n\n\"If he gets there, I lose him, Morey!\" said Arcot. The terrific\nacceleration of the climb seemed to press them to their seats with a\ndeadly weight. It was labor to talk--but still the car ahead shot\non--slowly they seemed to be overhauling him. Now that the velocities\nwere perforce lowered by the effects of gravity, and the air resistance\nof the atmosphere was well nigh gone, only the acceleration that the\nhuman body could stand was considered. The man ahead was pushing his\nplane ahead with an acceleration that would have killed many men!\n\nSlowly the acceleration of the machine was falling. Arcot pushed the\ncontrol over to the last ampere, and felt the slight surge, as greater\npower rushed through the coils momentarily. Soon this was gone too, as\nthe generator behind faltered. The driving power of the atmospheric heat\nwas gone. More than sixty miles below them they could see the Earth as a\ngreenish brown surface, slightly convex, and far to the east they could\ndistinguish a silvery line of water! But they had no eyes but for the\ncolumn of shooting flame that represented the fleeing raider! Out in\nairless space now, he was safe from them. They could not follow. Arcot\nturned the plane once more, parallel to the Earth, watching the plane\nabove through the roof window. Slowly the machine sank to the fifty-mile\nlevel, where there was just sufficient air to maintain it in efficient\noperation.\n\n\"Well, he beat us! But there is only one thing for us to do. He must\nhang there on his rockets till we leave, and we can hang here\nindefinitely, if we can only keep this cabin decently warm. He has no\nair to cool him, and he has the sun to warm him. The only thing that is\nworrying him right now is the heat of his rockets. But he can throw most\nof that out with the gases. Lord, that's some machine! But eventually\nhis rockets will give out, and down he will come, so we'll just hang\nhere beneath him and--whoa--not so fast--he isn't going to stay there,\nit seems; he is angling his ship off a bit, and shooting along, so that,\nbesides, holding himself up, he is making a little forward progress.\nWe'll have to follow! He's going to do some speeding, it seems! Well, we\ncan keep up with him, at our level.\"\n\n\"Dick, no plane ever made before would have stood the terrific pulls and\nyanks that his plane got. He was steering and twisting on the standard\ntype air rudders, and what strains he had! The unique type of plane must\nbe extremely strong. I never saw one shaped like his before, though--it\nis the obvious shape at that! It was just a huge triangular arrowhead!\nDid you ever see one like it?\"\n\n\"Something like it, yes, and so have you. Don't you recognize that as\nthe development of the old paper gliders you used to throw around as a\nkid? It has the same shape, the triangular wings with the point in the\nlead, except that he undoubtedly had a slight curve to the wings to\nincrease the efficiency. Something like the flying wings of fifty years\nago. I hope that man is only a kleptomaniac, because he can be cured of\nthat, and I may then have a new laboratory partner. He has some\nexceedingly intelligent ideas!\n\n\"He's an ingenious man, but I wish he didn't store quite so much fuel\nin his rocket tubes! It's unbearably cold in here, and I can't sacrifice\nany power just for comfort. The rocket ship up there seems to be getting\nmore and more acceleration in the level. He has me dropping steadily to\nget air to run the generator. He is going fast enough!\"\n\nThey followed beneath the pirate, faster and faster as the rockets of\nthe ship began to push it forward more and more.\n\n\"Dick, why is it he didn't use all his rockets at first instead of\ngradually increasing the power this way?\"\n\n\"If you were operating the ship, Morey, you'd understand. Look at the\nspeedometer a moment and see if you can figure it out.\"\n\n\"Hmmm--4.5 miles per second--buzzing right along--but I don't see what\nthat--good Lord! We never will get him at this rate! How do you expect\nto get him?\"\n\n\"I have no idea--yet. But you missed the important point. He is going\n4.5 miles a second. When he reaches 5 miles a second he will never come\ndown from his hundred and fifty mile high perch! He will establish an\norbit! He has so much centrifugal force already that he has very little\nweight. We are staying right beneath him, so we don't have much either.\nWell, there he goes in a last spurt. We are falling behind pretty\nfast--there we are catching up now--no--we are just holding parallel!\nHe's done it! Look!\"\n\nArcot pulled out his watch and let go of it. It floated motionless in\nthe air for a moment, then slowly drifted back toward the rear of the\nroom. \"I am using a bit of acceleration--a bit more than we need to\nmaintain our speed. We are up high enough to make the air resistance\nalmost nothing, even at this velocity, but we still require some power.\nI don't know--\"\n\nThere was a low buzz, repeated twice. Instantly Morey turned the dials\nof the radio receiving set--again the call signal sounded. In a moment a\nvoice came in--low, but distinct. The power seemed fading rapidly.\n\n\"I'm Wade--the Pirate--help if you can. Can you get outside the\natmosphere? Exceed orbital speed and fall out? Am in an orbit and can't\nget out. Fuel reserve gage stuck, and used all my rockets. No more\npower. Can not slow down and fall. I am running out of compressed air\nand the generator for this set is going--will take animation suspending\ngas--will you be able to reach me before entering night?\"\n\n\"Quick, Morey--answer that we will.\"\n\n\"We will try, Pirate--think we can make it!\"\n\n\"O.K.--power about gone--\"\n\nThe last of his power had failed! The pirate was marooned in space! They\nhad seen his rockets go out, leaving the exhaust tube glowing for a\nmoment before it, too, was dark, and only the sun shining on the silvery\nship made it visible.\n\n\"We have to hurry if we want to do anything before he reaches night!\nRadio the San Francisco fields that we will be coming in soon, and we\nneed a large electro-magnet--one designed to work on about 500 volts\nD.C., and some good sized storage cells; how many will have to be\ndecided later, depending on the room we will have for them. I'll start\ndecelerating now so we can make the turn and circle back. We are\nsomewhere west of Hawaii, I believe, but we ought to be able to do the\ntrick if we use all the power we can.\"\n\nMorey at once set to work with the radio set to raise San Francisco\nairport. He was soon in communication with them, and told them that he\nwould be there in about an hour. They promised all the necessary\nmaterials; also that they would get ready to receive the pirate once he\nwas finally brought in to them.\n\nIt was nearer an hour and a quarter later that the machine fell to the\ngreat San Francisco landing field, where the mechanics at once set to\nwork bolting a huge electro-magnet on the landing skids on the bottom of\nthe machine. The most serious problem was connecting the terminals\nelectrically without making holes in the hull of the ship. Finally one\nterminal was grounded, and the radio aerial used as the other. Fuller\nwas left behind on this trip, and a large number of cells were installed\nin every possible position. In the power room, a hastily arranged motor\ngenerator set was arranged, making it possible to run the entire ship\nfrom the batteries. Scarcely had these been battened down to prevent\nsliding under the accelerations necessary, than Arcot and Morey were\noff. The entire operation had required but fifteen minutes.\n\n\"How are you going to catch him, Arcot?\"\n\n\"I'll overtake him going west. If I went the other way I'd meet him\ngoing at over 10 miles a second in relation to his machine. He had the\nright idea. He told me to fall out to him at a greater than orbital\nspeed. I will go just within the Earth's atmosphere till I get just\nunder him, holding myself in the air by means of a downward acceleration\non the part of the regular lifting power units. I am going to try to\nreach eight miles a second. We will be overhauling him at three a\nsecond, and the ship will slow down to the right speed while falling out\nto him. We must reach him before he gets into the shadow of the Earth,\nthough, for if he reaches 'night' he will be without heat, and he'll die\nof cold. I think we can reach him, Dick!\"\n\n\"I hope so. Those spare cells are all right, aren't they? We'll need\nthem! If they don't function when we get out there, we'll fall clear off\ninto space! At eight miles a second, we would leave Earth forever!\"\n\nThe ship was accelerating steadily at the highest value the men aboard\ncould stand. The needle of the speedometer crept steadily across the\ndial. They were flying at a height of forty miles that they might have\nenough air and still not be too greatly hindered by air resistance. The\nblack sky above them was spotted with points of glowing light, the\nblazing stars of space. But as they flew along, the sensation of weight\nwas lost; they had reached orbital speed, and as the car steadily\nincreased its velocity, there came a strange sensation! The Earth loomed\ngigantic above them! Below them shone the sun! The direction of up and\ndown was changed by the terrific speed! The needle of the speedometer\nwas wavering at 7.8 miles a second. Now it held steady!\n\n\"I thought you were going to take it up to eight miles a second, Dick?\"\n\n\"Air resistance is too great! I'll have to go higher!\"\n\nAt a height of fifty miles they continued at 8.1 miles a second. It\nseemed hours before they reached the spot where the pirate's machine\nshould be flying directly above them, and they searched the black sky\nfor some sign of the shining dot of light. With the aid of field glasses\nthey found it, far ahead, and nearly one hundred miles above.\n\n\"Well, here we go! I'm going to fall up the hundred miles or so, till\nwe're right in his path; the work done against gravity will slow us down\na little, so I'll have to use the power units somewhat. Did you notice\nwhat I did to them?\"\n\n\"Yes, they're painted a dull black. What's the idea?\"\n\n\"We'll have no air from which to get heat for power out here, so we'll\nhave to depend on the sunlight they can absorb. I'm using it now to slow\nus down as much as possible.\"\n\nAt last the tiny silver dot had grown till it became recognizable as the\npirate plane. They were drawing up to it now, slowly, but steadily. At\nlast the little machine was directly beneath them, and a scant hundred\nyards away. They had long since been forced to run the machine on the\nstorage batteries, and now they applied a little power to the vertical\npower units. Sluggishly, as they absorbed the sun's heat, the machine\nwas forced lower, nearer to the machine below. At last a scant ten feet\nseparated them.\n\n\"All right, Morey.\"\n\nThere was a snap, as the temporary switch was closed, and the current\nsurged into the big magnet on the keel. At once they felt the ship jump\na little under the impulse of the magnet's pull on the smaller machine.\nIn a moment the little plane had drifted up to the now idle magnet,\ntouched it and was about to bounce off, when Morey again snapped the\nswitch shut and the two machines were locked firmly together!\n\n\"I've got him, Dick!\" Morey exclaimed. \"Now slow down till it falls.\nThen we can go and wait for it. Being a glider, it ought to be quite\nmanageable!\"\n\nNow the energy of the power units on the roof of the machine began to\nslow down the two machines, the magnet grinding slightly as the momentum\nof the plane was thrust upon it. They watched the speedometer drop. The\nspeed was sinking very slowly, for the area of the absorbing fins was\nnot designed to absorb the sun's heat directly, and was very\ninefficient. The sun was indeed sinking below their horizon; they were\njust beginning to watch that curious phenomenon of seeing dawn backward,\nwhen they first struck air dense enough to operate the power units\nnoticeably. Quickly the power was applied till the machines sank rapidly\nto the warmer levels, the only governing factor being the tendency of\nthe glider to break loose from the grip of the magnet.\n\nAt fifty miles the generator was started, and the heaters in the car at\nonce became more active. There was no heat in the car below, but that\nwas unavoidable. They would try to bring it down to warm levels quickly.\n\n\"Whew, I'm glad we reached the air again, Dick. I didn't tell you\nsooner, for it wouldn't have done any good, but that battery was about\ngone! We had something like twenty amp-hours left! I'm giving the\nrecharge generator all she will take. We seem to have plenty of power\nnow.\"\n\n\"I knew the cells were low, but I had no idea they were as low as that!\nI noticed that the magnet was weakening, but thought it was due to the\nadded air strain. I am going to put the thing into a nose dive and let\nthe glider go down itself. I know it would land correctly if it had a\nchance. I am going to follow it, of course, and since we are over the\nmiddle of Siberia we'd better start back.\"\n\nThe return trip was necessarily in the lower level of the atmosphere,\nthat the glider might be kept reasonably warm. At a height of but two\nmiles, in the turbulent atmosphere, the glider was brought slowly home.\nIt took them nearly twenty hours to go the short distance of twelve\nthousand miles to San Francisco, the two men taking turns at the\ncontrols. The air resistance of the glider forced them to go slowly;\nthey could not average much better than six hundred an hour despite the\nfact that the speed of either machine alone was over twelve hundred\nmiles an hour.\n\nAt last the great skyscrapers of San Francisco appeared on their\nhorizon, and thousands of private planes started out to meet them.\nFrantically Arcot warned them away, lest the air blast from their props\ntear the glider from the magnet. At last, however, the Air Guard was\nable to force them to a safe distance and clear a lane through one of\nthe lower levels of the city traffic. The great field of the\nTranscontinental lines was packed with excited men and women, waiting to\ncatch a glimpse of two of the greatest things the country had heard of\nin the century--Arcot's molecular motion machine and the Air Pirate!\n\nThe landing was made safely in the circle of Air Guardsmen. There was a\nsmall hospital plane standing beside it in a moment, and as Arcot's ship\nreleased it, and then hung motionless, soundless above it, the people\nwatched it in wonder and excitement. They wanted to see Arcot perform;\nthey clamored to see the wonderful powers of this ship in operation. Air\nGuardsmen who had witnessed the flying game of tag between these two\nsuper-air machines had told of it through the press and over the radio.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTwo weeks later, Arcot stepped into the office of Mr. Morey, senior.\n\n\"Busy?\"\n\n\"Come on in; you know I'm busy--but not _too_ busy for you. What's on\nyour mind?\"\n\n\"Wade--the pirate.\"\n\n\"Oh--hmm. I saw the reports on his lab out on the Rockies, and also the\npsychomedical reports on him. And most particularly, I saw the request\nfor his employment you sent through channels. What's your opinion on\nhim? You talked with him.\"\n\nArcot frowned slightly. \"When I talked to him he was still two different\nidentities dancing around in one body. Dr. Ridgely says the problem's\nsettling down; I believe him. Ridgely's no more of a fool in his line\nthan you and Dad are in your own lines, and Ridgely's business is\nhealing mental wounds. We agreed some while back that the Pirate must be\ninsane, even before we met him.\n\n\"We also agreed that he had a tremendously competent and creative mind.\nAs a personality in civilization, he'd evidently slipped several cogs.\nRidgely says that is reparable.\n\n\"You know, Newton was off the beam for about two years. Faraday was in a\ncomplete breakdown for nearly five years--and after his breakdown, came\nback to do some monumental work.\n\n\"And those men didn't have the help of modern psychomedical techniques.\n\n\"I think we'd be grade A fools ourselves to pass up the chance to get\nWade's help. The man--insane or not--figured out a way of stabilizing\nand storing atomic hydrogen for his rockets. If he could do that in the\nshape he was then in...!\n\n\"I'd say we'd be smart to keep the competition in the family.\"\n\nMr. Morey leaned back in his chair and smiled up at Arcot. \"You've got a\ngood case there. I'll buy it. When Dr. Ridgely says Wade's got those\nslipped cogs replaced--offer him a job in your lab staff.\n\n\"I'm a bit older than you are; you've grown up in a world where the\npsychomedical techniques really work. When I was growing up,\npsychomedical techniques were strictly rule of thumb--and the doctors\nwere all thumbs.\" Mr. Morey sighed. Then, \"In this matter, I think your\njudgment is better than mine.\"\n\n\"I'll see him again, and offer him the job. I'm pretty sure he'll take\nit, as I said. I have a suspicion that, within six months, he'll be a\nlot saner than most people around. The ordinary man doesn't realize what\na job of rechecking present techniques can do--and Wade is, naturally,\ngetting a very thorough overhaul.\n\n\"Somewhat like a man going in for treatment of a broken arm; in any\ndecent hospital they'll also check for any other medical problems, and\nhe'll come out healthier than if he had never had the broken arm.\n\n\"Wade seems to have had a mind that made friends with molecules, and\ntalked their language. After Ridgely shows him how to make friends with\npeople--I think he'll be quite a man on our team!\"\n\n\n\n\nBOOK TWO\n\nSOLARITE\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\nThe lights of great Transcontinental Airport were blazing in cheering\nsplendor. Out there in the center of the broad field a dozen men were\nsilhouetted in the white brilliance, looking up at the sky, where the\nstars winked cold and clear on the jet background of the frosty night. A\nslim crescent of moon gleamed in the west, a sickle of light that in no\nway dimmed the cold flame of the brilliant stars.\n\nOne point of light now moved across the motionless field of far-off\nsuns, flashing toward the airport in a long, swift curve. The men on the\nfield murmured and pointed up at it as it swept low over the blazing\nlights of New York. Lower it swooped, the towering city behind it. Half\na mile into the air the buildings rose in shining glory of colored tile\nthat shone brightly in the sweeping play of floodlights.\n\nOne of them picked out the descending machine, and it suddenly leaped\nout of the darkness as a shining, streamlined cylinder, a cylinder with\na great halo of blue fire, as the beam of the searchlight set it off\nfrom the jet black night.\n\nIn moments the ship was vast before the eyes of the waiting men; it had\nlanded gently on the field, was floating smoothly, gracefully toward\nthem.\n\nTwenty-four men climbed from the great ship, shivering in the icy blast\nthat swept across the field, spoke a moment with the group awaiting\ntheir arrival, then climbed quickly into the grateful warmth of a field\ncar. In a moment they were speeding toward the lights of the field\nhouse, half a mile off.\n\nBehind them the huge ship leaped into the sky, then suddenly pointed its\nnose up at an angle of thirty degrees and shot high into the air at an\nunbelievable speed. In an instant it was gone.\n\nAt the field house the party broke up almost immediately.\n\n\"We want to thank you, Mr. Morey, for your demonstration of the new ship\ntonight, and you, Dr. Arcot, for answering our many questions about it.\nI am sure we all appreciate the kindness you have shown the press.\" The\nreporters filed out quickly, anxious to get the news into the morning\neditions, for it was after one o'clock now. Each received a small slip\nof paper from the attendant standing at the exit, the official statement\nof the company. At last all had left but the six men who were\nresponsible for the new machine.\n\nThis night had witnessed the official demonstration of the first of the\nArcot-Morey molecular motion ships. Small as she was, compared to those\nthat were to come, yet she could carry over three thousand passengers,\nas many as could any existing winged plane, and her speed was immensely\ngreater. The trip from the west coast to the eastern had been made in\nless than one hour. At a speed close to one mile a second the great ship\nhad shot through the thin air, twenty-five miles above the Earth.\n\nIn this vessel a huge bar of metal could be affected by an\nultra-high-frequency generator. When so affected, its molecules all\nmoved forward, taking the ship with them. Thus, a molecular motion drive\nvessel could, theoretically, approach the velocity of light as a limit.\n\n\"Arcot,\" said Morey, Senior, after the pressmen had left the room, \"as\npresident of this company I certainly want to thank you for the\ntremendous thing you have given us to use. You have 'sold' us this\nmachine--but how can we repay you? Before this, time and time again,\nyou have sold us your inventions, the ideas that have made it possible\nfor Transcontinental to attain its present high position in world\ntransportation. All you have ever accepted is the laboratory you use,\nits upkeep, and a small annual income. What can we do to show our\nappreciation this time?\"\n\n\"Why,\" answered Arcot smiling, \"you haven't stated the terms correctly.\nActually, I have a fully equipped lab to putter around in, all the time\nI want for my own amusement, and all the money I want. What more could I\nask?\"\n\n\"I suppose that's all true--but you draw only about six thousand a year\nfor personal expenses--a good clerk could get that--and you, admittedly\nthe most brilliant physicist of the Earth, are satisfied! I don't feel\nwe're paying you properly!\"\n\nArcot's expression became suddenly serious. \"You can repay me this\ntime,\" he said, \"for this latest discovery has made a new thing\npossible. I've always wanted to be able to visit other planets--as has\nmany a scientist for the last three centuries. This machine has made it\npossible. If you are willing--we could start by the spring of 2117. I'm\nquite serious about this. With your permission, I want to start work on\nthe first interplanetary ship. I'll need Fuller's help, of course. The\nproposition will be expensive, and that's where I must ask you to help\nme. I think, however, that it may be a paying proposition, at that, for\nthere will certainly be something of commercial value on the other\nplanets.\"\n\nThey had walked out to the shed where Arcot's private molecular motion\ncar stood, the first machine ever built that used the heat of the sun to\ndrive it. Thoughtfully the president of the great Transcontinental Lines\nlooked at it. It was small compared with the great machine that had just\nbrought them east, but of the same swift type. It was a thing of\ngraceful beauty even on the ground, its long curving streamlines giving\nit wonderful symmetry. They stood in thoughtful silence for a\nminute--the young men eager to hear the verdict of their prospective\nbacker. Morey, always rather slow of speech, took an unusually long\ntime to answer.\n\n\"If it were only money you asked for, Arcot, I'd gladly give you double\nthe sum, but that isn't the case. I know perfectly well that if you do\ngo, my son will go with you, and Fuller and Wade will naturally go too.\"\nHe looked at each in turn. \"Each of you has come to mean a lot to me.\nYou and Fuller have known Bob since college days. I've known Wade only\nthree months, but every day I grow to like him more. There's no denying\nthe fact that any such trip is a terrifically dangerous proposition. But\nif you were lost, there would be more than my personal loss. We would\nlose some of the most brilliant men on Earth. You, for instance, are\nconceded as being the world's most brilliant physicist; Fuller is one of\nthe greatest designing engineers; Wade is rapidly rising into prominence\nas a chemist and as a physicist; and my son is certainly a good\nmathematician.\"\n\nHe paused, frowning, weighing the situation. \"But you men should know\nhow to get out of scrapes just that much better. Certainly there are few\nmen on Earth who would not be willing to back such a group of men--or\nany one of you, for that matter! I'll back your trip!\" His words became\nmore facetious. \"I know that Arcot and you, Bob, can handle a gun fairly\nwell, I don't know so much about Wade and Fuller. What experience have\nyou two had?\"\n\nFuller shook his head. \"I think I'll fit best in the galley on the trip,\nMr. Morey. I've done the cooking on a number of camping trips, and food\nis an important factor in the success of any expedition. I can shoot a\nbit, too.\"\n\nWade spoke rather hesitantly. \"I come from the west, and have had a good\nbit of fun with a gun in the Rockies; there are still some mountain\nlions and some deer there, you know. I also have a sneaking acquaintance\nwith the new gun, which Arcot developed in connection with his molecular\nmotion. But there is so little you know about me--and most of it bad--I\ndon't see how I really get in on this opportunity--but,\" he added\nhastily, \"I certainly don't intend to keep the old boy knocking--I'm\nwith you, since I'm invited!\"\n\nArcot smiled. \"Then you'll definitely support us?\"\n\n\"Yes, I will,\" replied Morey, Senior, seriously, \"for I think it's worth\ndoing.\"\n\nThe four young men climbed into the ship, to start for their apartment.\nArcot was piloting, and under his sure touch the ship sped out into the\ncold night air, then up through the atmosphere, till they hung poised at\na height of fifty miles on the upper edge of the airy blanket. They\nlooked out in silent thought at the magnificent blazing stars of space.\nHere, where the dust-laden air could no longer mask their true colors,\nthe stars shone unwinkingly, steadily, and in a glory that earth-bound\nmen had never seen before. They shone in a wonderous riot of color, as\nvaried and as beautiful as the display of colored floodlights in some\ngreat city. They were tiny pinpoints of radiance, red, green, orange,\nand yellow, shining with intense brilliance.\n\nSlowly Arcot let the machine settle to the blazing city miles below.\n\n\"I love to come out here and look at those cold, pinpoint lights; they\nseem to draw me--the lure of other worlds. I've always had a sense of\nunfulfilled longing--the desire to go out there--and it's always been so\nhopeless. Now--I'll be out there by next spring!\" Arcot paused and\nlooked up at the mighty field of stars that arched over his head to be\nlost on either horizon. A wonderful night!\n\n\"Where shall we go first, Dick?\" asked Wade softly as he gazed out at\nthe far-off suns of space, his voice unconsciously hushed by the\ngrandeur of the spectacle.\n\n\"I've thought of that for the last four months, and now that we are\ndefinitely going to go, we'll have to make a decision. Actually, it\nwon't be too hard to decide. Of course we can't leave the solar system.\nAnd the outer planets are so far away that I think we had better wait\ntill later trips. That leaves the choice really between Mars, Venus, and\nMercury. Mercury isn't practical since it's so close to the sun. We know\na fair bit about Mars from telescopic observation, while Venus, wrapped\nin perpetual cloud, is a mystery. What do you vote?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Morey, \"it seems to me it's more fun to explore a\ncompletely unknown planet than one that can be observed telescopically.\nI vote Venus.\" Each of the others agreed with Morey that Venus was the\nlogical choice.\n\nBy this time the machine had sunk to the roof of their apartment, and\nthe men disembarked and entered. The next day they were to start the\nactual work of designing the space ship.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\n\"When we start this work,\" Arcot began next morning, \"we obviously want\nto design the ship for the conditions we expect to meet, and for maximum\nconvenience and safety. I believe I've thought about this trip longer\nthan the rest of you, so I'll present my ideas first.\n\n\"We don't actually _know_ anything about conditions on Venus, since no\none has actually been there. Venus is probably a younger planet than\nEarth. It's far nearer the sun than we are, and it gets twice the heat\nwe do. In the long-gone time when the planets were cooling I believe\nVenus required far longer than Earth, for the inpouring heat would\nretard its cooling. The surface temperature is probably about 150\ndegrees Fahrenheit.\n\n\"There is little land, probably, for with the cloud-mass covering Venus\nas it does, it's logical to visualize tremendous seas. What life has\ndeveloped must be largely aquatic, and the land is probably far behind\nus in evolution. Of course, Venus is the planet of mystery--we don't\nknow; we can only guess. But we do know what things we are going to need\nto cross space.\n\n\"Obviously, the main driving force will be the power units. These will\nget their energy from the rays of the sun by absorbing them in copper\ndiscs about twelve feet in diameter--the ship will have to be more of a\ndisc than a cylinder. I think a ship a hundred and eighty feet long,\nfifty feet wide, and twenty feet deep will be about the best dimensions.\nThe power units will be strung along the top of the ship in double\nrows--one down each side of the hull. In the middle will be a series of\nfused quartz windows, opening into a large room just under the outer\nshell. We'll obviously need some source of power to activate the power\ntubes that run the molecular motion power units. We'll have a generator\nrun by molecular motion power units in here, absorbing its heat from the\natmosphere in this room. The air will be heated by the rays of the sun,\nof course, and in this way we'll get all our power from the sun itself.\n\n\"Since this absorption of energy might result in making the ship too\ncool, due to the radiation of the side away from the sun, we'll polish\nit, and thus reduce the unlighted side's radiation.\n\n\"The power units will not be able to steer us in space, due to their\nposition, and those on the sides, which will steer us in the atmosphere\nby the usual method, will be unable to get the sun's power; they'll be\nshaded. For steering in space, we'll use atomic hydrogen rockets,\nstoring the atomic gas by the Wade method in tanks in the hold. We'll\nalso have a battery down there for starting the generator and for\nemergencies.\n\n\"For protection against meteors, we'll use radar. If anything comes\nwithin a dozen miles of us, the radar unit covering that sector will at\nonce set automatic machinery in operation, and the rockets will shoot\nthe ship out of the path of the meteor.\"\n\nAll that day Arcot and the others discussed the various pieces of\napparatus they would need, and toward evening Fuller began to draw rough\nsketches of the different mechanisms that had been agreed upon.\n\nThe next day, by late afternoon, they had planned the rough details of\nthe ship and had begun the greater task of calculating the stresses and\nthe power factors.\n\n\"We won't need any tremendous strength for the ship while it is in\nspace,\" Arcot commented, \"for then there will be little strain on it.\nIt will be weightless from the start, and the gentle acceleration will\nnot strain it in the least, but we must have strength, so that it can\nmaneuver in the atmosphere.\n\n\"We'll leave Earth by centrifugal force, for I can make much better\nspeed in the atmosphere where there is plenty of power to draw on;\noutside I must depend solely on sunlight. We'll circle the Earth,\nforming an orbit just within the atmosphere, at five miles a second.\nWe'll gradually increase the speed to about ten miles a second, at which\npoint the ship would normally fly off into space under its own\ncentrifugal force. With the power units we'll prevent its release until\nthe proper moment. When we release it, it will be entirely free of\nEarth, and no more work will be needed to overcome Earth's pull.\"\n\nThe planning continued with exasperating slowness. The details of the\nwork were complex, for all the machines were totally new. Several weeks\npassed before even the power units could be ordered and the first work\non the ship started. After that orders for materials left the office\ndaily. Still, it was late in November before the last order was sent\nout.\n\nNow they must begin work on other phases of the expedition--food\nsupplies and the standard parts of the equipment.\n\nIn the interval Arcot had decided to make a special ventilated suit for\nuse on Venus. This was to make use of a small molecular motion director\napparatus to cool the air, and blow it through the suit. The apparatus\nconsisted of a small compressed air-driven generator and a power tube\nbank that could be carried on the back.\n\n\"Arcot,\" Wade said when he saw the apparatus completed and the testing\nmachine ready, \"I've just noticed how similar this is to the portable\ninvisibility apparatus I developed as the Pirate. I wonder if it might\nnot be handy at times to be invisible--we could incorporate that with a\nslight change. It wouldn't add more than five pounds, and those tubes\nyou are using I'm sure are easily strong enough to carry the extra\nload.\"\n\n\"Great idea, Wade,\" said Arcot. \"It might be very useful if we met\nhostile natives. The disappearance stunt might make us gods or something\nto primitive beings. And now that you mention it, I think we can install\nthe apparatus in the ship. It will require almost no power, and might\nsave our lives some time.\"\n\nThe work went forward steadily at the great Transcontinental Shops where\nthe space ship was being built. Its construction was being kept as much\nof a secret as possible, for Arcot feared the interference of the crowds\nthat would be sure to collect if the facts were known, and since the\nshops directly joined the airfield, it meant that there would be\nhelicopters buzzing about the Transatlantic and Transcontinental planes.\n\nThe work to be done required the most careful manipulation and\nworkmanship, for one defect could mean death. They calculated six weeks\nfor the trip, and in the time before they could reach either planet,\nmuch might happen to a crippled ship.\n\nTo the men who were making the trip, the waiting seemed most\nexasperating, and they spent the days before they could begin the\ninstallation of the electrical apparatus in purchasing the necessary\nstandard equipment; the standard coils, tubes, condensers, the canned\nfood supplies, clothes, everything that they could imagine as of\npossible utility. They were making the ship with a great deal of empty\nstorage space, for Arcot hoped the trip would be a financial success,\nparticularly supplying much-needed metals. Many vital elements were\nalready excessively scarce, and no satisfactory substitutes had been\nfound.\n\nOn the outward trip some of this space would be filled with the many\nthings they would consume en route. In addition they were carrying a\ngreat many spare parts, spare tubes, spare power units, spare\ncondensers--a thousand and one odd parts. Arcot intended that they\nshould be able to make an entire new power switchboard and motion\ndirector unit if anything should go wrong, and he certainly had all the\napparatus.\n\nAt last came the day when the final connection had been soldered, and\nthe last joint welded. The atomic hydrogen tanks were full, and under\nthe ship's own power the oxygen tanks were filled and the batteries\ncharged. They were ready for a test flight!\n\nThe great ship rested on the floor of the shed now, awaiting the start.\n\n\"Oh fellows--come here a minute!\" Arcot called to the other members of\nthe party. \"I want to show you something.\"\n\nThe three walked quickly to the bow where Arcot stood, and following the\nline of his vision, looked in wonder to see that everything was right.\nThey watched curiously as he drew from his coat a large glass bottle,\ntightly sealed.\n\n\"What's that for?\" asked Wade curiously.\n\n\"We're about to start on the first cruise, and I've been wondering if it\nisn't time we gave the ship a name.\"\n\n\"Great--I'd been thinking of that too--what are we going to name her?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Arcot, \"I had been thinking of Alexander--he longed for\nother worlds to conquer!\"\n\n\"Not bad,\" Morey commented. \"I have been thinking of naming it too--I\nguess we all have--but I was thinking of Santa Maria--the first ship to\ndiscover the New World.\"\n\n\"I was thinking more of its home,\" said Wade. \"How about calling it\nTerrestrian?\"\n\n\"Well--it's your turn, Fuller--you designed it. What do you suggest for\nyour masterpiece?\" asked Arcot.\n\n\"I was thinking also of its home--the home it will never leave. I like\nto think that we might find people on Venus, and I would like to have a\nname on it that might be translatable into more friendly and less\nforeign terms--why not call it Solarite?\"\n\n\"Solarite--a member of the solar system--it will be that, always. It\nwill be a world unto itself when it makes its trips--it will take up an\norbit about the sun--a true member of the solar system. I like it!\"\nArcot turned to the others. \"How about it?\" It was agreed upon\nunanimously.\n\n\"But I'm still curious about that glass bottle, so carefully sealed.\"\nMorey commented with a puzzled smile. \"What's in it? Some kind of gas?\"\n\n\"Wrong--no gas--practically nothing at all, in fact. What more\nappropriate for christening a space ship than a bottle of hard vacuum?\n\n\"We can't have a pretty girl christen this ship, that's sure. A flying\nbachelor's apartment christened by a mere woman? Never! We will have the\nforeman of the works here do that. Since we can't have the ship slide\ndown the ways or anything, we will get inside and move it when he\nsmashes the bottle. But in the meantime, let's have a symbol set in\ncontrasting metal on the bow. We can have a blazing sun, with nine\nplanets circling it, the Earth indicated conspicuously; and below it the\nword SOLARITE.\"\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nIt was shortly after noon when the newly christened _Solarite_ left on\nits first trip into space. The sun was a great ball of fire low in the\nwest when they returned, dropping plummet-like from the depths of space,\nthe rush of the air about the hull, a long scream that mounted from a\nhalf-heard sound in the outer limits of the Earth's atmosphere, to a\nroar of tortured air as the ship dropped swiftly to the field and shot\ninto the hanger. Instantly the crew darted to the side of the great\ncylinder as the door of the ship opened.\n\nFuller appeared in the opening, and at the first glimpse of his face,\nthe hanger crew knew something was wrong. \"Hey, Jackson,\" Fuller called,\n\"get the field doctor--Arcot had a little accident out there in space!\"\nIn moments the man designated returned with the doctor, leading him\nswiftly down the long metal corridor of the _Solarite_ to Arcot's room\naboard.\n\nThere was a mean-looking cut in Arcot's scalp, but a quick, sure\nexamination by the doctor revealed that there appeared to be no serious\ninjury. He had been knocked unconscious by the blow that made the cut,\nand he had not yet recovered his senses.\n\n\"How did this happen?\" asked the doctor as he bathed the cut and deftly\nbandaged it.\n\nMorey explained: \"There's a device aboard whose job it is to get us out\nof the way of stray meteors, and it works automatically. Arcot and I\nwere just changing places at the controls. While neither of us was\nstrapped into our seats, a meteor came within range and the rocket tubes\nshot the car out of the way. We both went tumbling head over heels and\nArcot landed on his ear. I was luckier, and was able to break my fall\nwith my hands, but it was a mean fall--at our speed we had about double\nweight, so, though it was only about seven feet, we might as well have\nfallen fourteen. We took turns piloting the ship, and Arcot was about to\nbring us back when that shock just about shook us all over the ship. We\nwill have to make some changes. It does its job--but we need warning\nenough to grab hold.\"\n\nThe doctor was through now, and he began to revive his patient. In a\nmoment he stirred and raised his hand to feel the sore spot. In ten\nminutes he was conversing with his friends, apparently none the worse\nexcept for a very severe headache. The doctor gave him a mild opiate,\nand sent him to bed to sleep off the effects of the blow.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith the ship fully equipped, tested and checked in every possible way,\nthe time for leaving was set for the following Saturday, three days off.\nGreat supplies of stores had to be carried aboard in the meantime. Care\nhad to be exercised in this work, lest the cargo slip free under varying\nacceleration of the _Solarite_, and batter itself to bits, or even wreck\nsome vital part of the ship. At noon on the day chosen, the first ship\never to leave the bounds of the Earth's gravity was ready to start!\n\nGently the heavily laden _Solarite_ rose from the hangar floor, and\nslowly floated out into the bright sunshine of the early February day.\nBeside it rode the little ship that Arcot had first built, piloted by\nthe father of the inventor. With him rode the elder Morey and a dozen\nnewsmen. The little ship was badly crowded now as they rose slowly, high\ninto the upper reaches of the Earth's atmosphere. The sky about them\nwas growing dark--they were going into space!\n\nAt last they reached the absolute ceiling of the smaller ship, and it\nhung there while the _Solarite_ went a few miles higher; then slowly,\nbut ever faster and faster they were plunging ahead, gathering speed.\n\nThey watched the radio speedometer creep up--1-2-3-4-5-6--steadily it\nrose as the acceleration pressed them hard against the back of the\nseats--8-9--still it rose as the hum of the generator became a low\nsnarl--10-11-12--they were rocketing at twelve miles a second, the\ntenuous air about the ship shrieking in a thin scream of protest as it\nparted on the streamlined bow.\n\nSlowly the speed rose--reached fifteen miles a second. The sun's pull\nbecame steadily more powerful; they were falling toward the fiery\nsphere, away from the Earth. A microphone recessed in the outer wall\nbrought them the fading whisper of air from outside. Arcot shouted a\nsudden warning:\n\n\"Hold on--we're going to lose all weight--out into space!\"\n\nThere was a click, and the angry snarl of the overworked generator died\nin an instant as the thudding relays cut it out of the circuit.\nSimultaneously the air scoop which had carried air to the generator\nswitched off, transferring to solar heat as a source of power. They\nseemed to be falling with terrific and ever-increasing speed. They\nlooked down--saw the Earth shrinking visibly as they shot away at more\nthan five miles a second; they were traveling fifteen miles a second\nahead and five a second straight up.\n\nThe men watched with intensest interest as the heavens opened up before\nthem--they could see stars now a scant degree from the sun itself, for\nno air diffused its blinding glory. The heat of the rays seemed to burn\nthem; there was a prickling pleasantness to it now, as they looked at\nthe mighty sea of flame through smoked glasses. The vast arms of the\ncorona reached out like the tentacles of some fiery octopus through\nthousands of miles of space--huge arms of flaming gas that writhed out\nas though to reach and drag back the whirling planets to the parent\nbody. All about the mighty sphere, stretching far into space, a wan glow\nseemed to ebb and flow, a kaleidoscope of swiftly changing color. It was\nthe zodiacal light, an aurora borealis on a scale inconceivable!\n\nArcot worked rapidly with the controls, the absence of weight that gave\nthat continued sense of an unending fall, aiding him and his assistants\nin their rapid setting of the controls.\n\nAt last the work was done and the ship flashed on its way under the\ncontrol of the instruments that would guide it across all the millions\nof miles of space and land it on Venus with unerring certainty. The\nphoto-electric telescopic eye watched the planet constantly, keeping the\nship surely and accurately on the course that would get them to the\ndistant planet in the shortest possible time.\n\nWork thereafter became routine requiring a minimum of effort, and the\nmen could rest and use their time to observe the beauties of the skies\nas no man had ever seen them during all the billions of years of time\nthat this solar system has existed. The lack of atmosphere made it\npossible to use a power of magnification that no terrestrial telescope\nmay use. The blurred outlines produced by the shifting air prohibits\nmagnifications of more than a few hundred diameters, but here in space\nthey could use the greatest power of their telescope. With it they could\nlook at Mars and see it more clearly than any other man had ever seen\nit, despite the fact that it was now over two hundred million miles\naway.\n\nBut though they spent much time taking photographs of the planets and of\nthe moon, and in making spectrum analyses of the sun, time passed very\nslowly. Day after day they saw measured on the clocks, but they stayed\nawake, finding they needed little sleep, for they wasted no physical\nenergy. Their weightlessness eliminated fatigue. However, they\ndetermined that during the twelve hours before reaching Venus they must\nbe thoroughly alert, so they tried to sleep in pairs. Arcot and Morey\nwere the first to seek slumber--but Morpheus seemed to be a mundane god,\nfor he did not reward them. At last it became necessary for them to\ntake a mild opiate, for their muscles refused to permit their tired\nbrains to sleep. It was twelve hours later when they awoke, to relieve\nWade and Fuller.\n\nThey spent most of the twelve hours of their routine watch in playing\ngames of chess. There was little to be done. The silver globe before\nthem seemed unchanging, for they were still so far away it seemed little\nlarger than the moon does when seen from Earth.\n\nBut at last it was time for the effects of the mild drug to wear off,\nand for Wade and Fuller to awaken from their sleep.\n\n\"Morey--I've an idea!\" There was an expression of perfect innocence on\nArcot's face--but a twinkle of humor in his eyes. \"I wonder if it might\nnot be interesting to observe the reactions of a man waking suddenly\nfrom sleep to find himself alone in space?\" He stared thoughtfully at\nthe control that would make the ship perfectly transparent, perfectly\ninvisible.\n\n\"I wonder if it would?\" said Morey grasping Arcot's idea. \"What do you\nsay we try it?\" Arcot turned the little switch--and where there had been\nthe ship, it was no more--it was gone!\n\nFuller stirred uneasily in his bed, tightly strapped as he was. The\neffects of the drug were wearing off. Sleepily he yawned--stretched, and\nblindly, his heavy eyes still closed, released the straps that held him\nin bed. Yawning widely he opened his eyes--with a sudden start sat\nupright--then, with an excellent imitation of an Indian on the warpath,\nhe leaped from his bed, and started to run wildly across the floor. His\neyes were raised to the place where the ceiling should have been--he\ncalled lustily in alarm--then suddenly he was flying up--and crashed\nheavily against the invisible ceiling! His face was a picture of utter\nastonishment as he fell lightly to the floor--then slowly it changed,\nand took on a chagrined smile--he understood!\n\nHe spun around as loud cries suddenly resounded from Wade's room across\nthe hall--then there was a dull thud, as he too, forgetting the\nweightlessness, jumped and hit the ceiling. Then the cries were gone,\nlike the snuffing of a candle. From the control room there rose loud\nlaughter--and a moment later they felt more normal, as they again saw\nthe four strong walls about them.\n\nWade sighed heavily and shook his head.\n\nThey were approaching the planet visibly now. In the twelve hours that\nhad passed they had covered a million miles, for now they were falling\ntoward the planet under its attraction. It glowed before them now in\nwonderous splendour, a mighty disc of molten silver.\n\nFor the last twenty-four hours they had been reducing their speed\nrelative to Venus, to insure their forming an orbit about the planet,\nrather than shoot around it and back into space. Their velocity had been\nover a hundred miles a second part of the way, but now it had been\nreduced to ten. The gravity of the planet was urging them forward at\never increasing speed, and their problem became more acute moment by\nmoment.\n\n\"We'll never make it on the power units alone, out here in space,\" said\nArcot seriously. \"We'll just shoot around the planet. I'll tell you how\nwe can do it, though. We'll circle around it, entering its atmosphere on\nthe daylight side, and shoot into the upper limits of its atmosphere.\nThere the power units can find some heat to work on, and we can really\nslow down. But we'll have to use the rocket tubes to get the\nacceleration we'll need to drive the ship into the air.\"\n\nThere was a sudden clanging of a bell, and everyone dived for a hold,\nand held on tightly. An instant later there was a terrific wrench as the\nrocket jets threw the plane out of the way of a meteor.\n\n\"We're getting near a planet. This is the third meteor we've met since\nwe were more than a million miles from Earth. Venus and Earth and all\nthe planets act like giant vacuum cleaners of space, pulling into\nthemselves all the space debris and meteors within millions of miles by\ntheir gravitational attraction.\"\n\nSwiftly the planet expanded below them--growing vaster with each passing\nmoment. It had changed from a disc to a globe, and now, as the molten\nsilver of its surface seemed swiftly clouding, it turned grey; then they\nsaw its true appearance, a vast field of rolling, billowing clouds!\n\nThe _Solarite_ was shooting around the planet now at ten miles a second,\nfar more than enough to carry them away from the planet again, out into\nspace once more if their speed was not checked.\n\n\"Hold on everybody,\" Arcot called. \"We're going to turn toward the\nplanet now!\" He depressed a small lever--there was a sudden shock, and\nall the space about them seemed to burst into huge, deep-red atomic\nhydrogen flames.\n\nThe _Solarite_ reeled under the sudden pressure, but the heavy\ngyroscopic stabilizers caught it, held it, and the ship remained on an\neven keel. Then suddenly there came to the ears of the men a long drawn\nwhine, faint--almost inaudible--and the ship began slowing down. The\n_Solarite_ had entered the atmosphere of Venus--the first man-made\nmachine to thus penetrate the air of another world!\n\nQuickly Arcot snapped open the control that had kept the rockets\nflaming, turning the ship to the planet--driving it into the atmosphere.\nNow they could get their power from the air that each instant grew more\ndense about them.\n\n\"Wade--in the power room--emergency control post--Morey--control board\nthere--hang on, for we'll have to use some husky accelerations.\"\n\nInstantly the two men sprang for their posts--literally diving, for they\nwere still almost weightless.\n\nArcot pulled another lever--there was a dull snap as a relay in the\npower room responded--the lights wavered--dimmed--then the generator was\nonce more humming smoothly--working on the atmosphere of Venus! In a\nmoment the power units were again operating, and now as they sucked a\nplentitude of power from the surrounding air, they produced a force that\nmade the men cling to their holds with almost frantic force. Around them\nthe rapidly increasing density of the air made the whine grow to a roar;\nthe temperature within the ship rose slowly, warmed by friction with\nthe air, despite the extreme cold at this altitude, more than\nseventy-five miles above the surface of the planet.\n\nThey began dropping rapidly now--their radio-speedometer had fallen from\nten to nine--then slowly, but faster and faster as more heat could be\nextracted from the air, it had fallen 8--7--6--5--4. Now they were well\nbelow orbital speed, falling under the influence of the planet. The\nstruggle was over--the men relaxed. The ship ran quietly now, the smooth\nhum of the air rushing over the great power units coming softly through\nthe speaker to their ears, a humming melody--the song of a new world.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nSuddenly the blazing sun was gone and they were floating in a vast world\nof rolling mists--mists that brushed the car with tiny clicks, which,\nwith the millions of particles that struck simultaneously, merged into a\nsteady roar.\n\n\"Ice--ice clouds!\" Morey exclaimed.\n\nArcot nodded. \"We'll drop below the clouds; they're probably miles deep.\nLook, already they're changing--snow now--in a moment it will be\nwater--then it'll clear away and we'll actually see Venus!\"\n\nFor ten miles--an endless distance it seemed--they dropped through\nclouds utterly impenetrable to the eye. Then gradually the clouds\nthinned; there appeared brief clear spots, spots into which they could\nsee short distances--then here and there they caught glimpses of green\nbelow. Was it water--or land?\n\nWith a suddenness that startled them, they were out of the clouds,\nshooting smoothly and swiftly above a broad plain. It seemed to stretch\nfor endless miles across the globe, to be lost in the far distance to\neast and west; but to the north they saw a low range of hills that rose\nblue and misty in the distance.\n\n\"Venus! We made it!\" Morey cried jubilantly. \"The first men ever to\nleave Earth--I'm going to start the old sender and radio back home!\nMan--look at that stretch of plain!\" He jumped to his feet and started\nacross the control room. \"Lord--I feel like of ton of lead now--I sure\nam out of condition for walking after all that time just floating!\"\n\nArcot raised a restraining hand. \"Whoa--wait a minute there, Morey--you\nwon't get anything through to them now. The Earth is on the other side\nof Venus--it's on the night side, remember--and we're on the day side.\nIn about twelve hours we'll be able to send a message. In the meantime,\ntake the controls while I make a test of the air here, will you?\"\n\nRelieved of the controls, Arcot rose and walked down the corridor to the\npower room where the chemical laboratory had been set up. Wade had\nalready collected a dozen samples of air, and was working on them.\n\n\"How is it--what have you tested for so far?\" asked Arcot.\n\n\"Oxygen and CO_{2}. The oxygen is about twenty-two per cent, or\nconsidering the slightly lower air pressure here, we will have just\nabout the right amount of oxygen. The CO_{2} is about one-tenth of one\nper cent. The atmosphere is O.K. for terrestrial life apparently; that\nmouse there is living quite happily. Whatever the other seventy-five per\ncent or so of diluting gas is, I don't know, but it isn't nitrogen.\"\n\nBriefly Arcot and Wade discussed the unusual atmosphere, finally\ndeciding that the inert gas was argon.\n\n\"No great amount of nitrogen,\" Arcot concluded. \"That means that life\nwill have a sweet time extracting it from the air--but wherever there is\nlife, it finds a way to do the impossible. Test it more accurately, will\nyou--you try for nitrogen and I'll try the component inert gasses.\"\n\nThey ran the analyses rapidly, and in a very short time--less than an\nhour--their results stood at 23 per cent oxygen, .1 per cent carbon\ndioxide, 68 per cent argon, 6 per cent nitrogen, 2 per cent helium, 5\nper cent neon, .05 per cent hydrogen, and the rest krypton and xenon\napparently. The analyses of these inert gasses had to be done rather\nroughly in this short time, but it was sufficient to balance fairly\naccurately.\n\nThe two chemists reported back to the control cabin.\n\n\"Well, we'll be able to breathe the atmosphere of Venus with ease. I\nbelieve we can go on now. I have been surprised to see no water in\nsight, but I think I see my mistake now. You know the Mississippi has\nits mouth further from the center of the Earth than its source; it flows\nup hill! The answer is, of course, that the centrifugal force of the\nEarth's spin impels it to flow that way. Similarly, I am sure now that\nwe will find that Venus has a vast belt of water about the middle, and\nto the north and south there will be two great caps of dry land. We are\non the northern cap.\n\n\"We have the microphone turned way down. Let's step up the power a bit\nand see if there are any sounds outside,\" said Arcot and walked over to\nthe power control switch. An instant later a low hum came from the\nloudspeaker. There was a light breeze blowing. In the distance, forming\na dull background for the hum, there came a low rumbling that seemed\npunctuated now and then by a greater sound.\n\n\"Must be a long way off,\" said Arcot, a puzzled frown on his face.\n\"Swing the ship around so we can see in what direction the sound is\nloudest,\" he suggested.\n\nSlowly Morey swung the ship around on its vertical axis. Without a\ndoubt, something off in the direction of the hills was making a\nconsiderable noise.\n\n\"Arcot, if that's a fight between two animals--two of those giant\nanimals that you said might be here--I don't care to get near them!\"\nFuller's narrowed eyes strove to penetrate the haze that screened the\nlow hills in the blue distance.\n\nThe microphone was shut off while the _Solarite_ shot swiftly forward\ntoward the source of the sound. Quickly the hills grew, the blue\nmistiness disappearing, and the jagged mounds revealing themselves as\nbleak harsh rock. As they drew nearer they saw beyond the hills,\nintermittent flashes of brilliant light, heard shattering blasts of\nsound.\n\n\"A thunderstorm!\" Wade began, but Arcot interrupted.\n\n\"Not so fast, Wade--Fuller's animal _is_ there--the only animal in all\ncreation that can make a noise like that! Look through the\ntelescope--see those dots wheeling about there above the flashing\nlights? The only animal that can make that racket is man! There are men\nover there--and they aren't in a playful mood! Turn on the invisibility\nwhile we can, Morey--and let's get nearer!\"\n\n\"Look out--here we go!\" Morey began to close a tiny switch set in one\nside of the instrument panel--then, before the relay below could move,\nhe had flipped it back.\n\n\"Here, you take it, Arcot--you always think about two steps ahead of\nme--you're quicker and know the machine better anyway.\"\n\nQuickly the two men exchanged places.\n\n\"I don't know about that, Morey,\" said a voice from vacancy, for Arcot\nhad at once thrown the ship into invisibility. \"The longer we're here,\nthe more mistakes I see we made in our calculations. I see what put me\noff so badly on my estimate of the intelligence of life found here! The\nsun gives it a double dose of heat--but also a double dose of other\nradiations--some of which evidently speed up evolution. Anyway, we may\nbe able to find friends here more quickly if we aid one side or the\nother in the very lively battle going on there. Before we go any\nfurther, what's our decision?\"\n\n\"I think it is a fine idea,\" said Fuller. \"But which side are we to\naid--and what are the sides? We haven't even seen them yet. Let's go\nnearer and take a good look.\"\n\n\"Yes--but are we going to join either side after looking?\"\n\n\"Oh, that's unanimous!\" said Wade, excitedly.\n\nThe invisible ship darted forward. They sped past the barrier of low\nhills, and were again high above a broad plain. With a startled gasp,\nArcot cut their speed. There, floating high in the air, above a\nmagnificent city, was a machine such as no man had ever before seen! It\nwas a titanic airplane--monstrous, gargantuan, and every other word that\ndenoted immensity. Fully three-quarters of a mile the huge metal wings\nstretched out in the dull light of the cloudy Venerian day; a machine\nthat seemed to dwarf even the vast city beneath it. The roar of its\nmighty propellers was a rumbling thunder to the men in the _Solarite_.\nFrom it came the flashing bursts of flame.\n\nOn closer inspection, the watchers saw what seemed to be a swarm of tiny\ngnats flying about the mighty plane. They appeared to be attacking the\ngiant as vainly as gnats might attack an eagle, for they could not\ndamage the giant machine. The flashing bombs burst in blasts of yellow\nflame as harmlessly as so many firecrackers.\n\nAll that mighty plane was covered with heavy metal plates, fully ten\ninches thick, and of metal so tough that when the powerful bombs hit it\nthey made no impression, though they blasted tremendous craters in the\nsoil below. From it poured a steady stream of bombs that burst with a\ngreat flash of heat and light, and in an instant the tiny planes they\nstruck streaked down as incandescent masses of metal.\n\nYet the giant seemed unable to approach the city--or was it defending\nit? No, for it was from the city that the vainly courageous little ships\npoured out. But certainly it was not these ships that kept the titanic\nbattleship of the air at bay!\n\nTensely the men watched the uneven conflict. The rain of bombs\ncontinued, though all fell short of the city. But slowly around the\nmetropolis there appeared an area of flaring, molten lava, and steadily\nthis moved toward the beautiful buildings. Suddenly the battleship\nturned toward the city and made a short dash inward on its circling\npath. As though awaiting this maneuver, a battery of hissing, flaming\nswords of white light flashed upward, a few hundred feet from the ring\nof molten rock. As the titanic plane rolled, side-slipped out of the\nway, they passed, harmlessly, barely missing a monstrous wing.\n\n\"Which?\" Arcot demanded. \"I say the city. No one should destroy anything\nso magnificent.\"\n\nNot a dissenting voice was raised, so Arcot sent the _Solarite_ nearer.\n\n\"But what in the world can we do to that huge thing?\" Fuller's voice\ncame eerily out of the emptiness. \"It has perfect invulnerability\nthrough size alone.\"\n\nThere was sudden silence among the Terrestrials as one of the tiny\nplanes darted forward and dove at full speed directly toward one of the\ngiant's propellers. There were fifty of these strung along each great\nwing. If enough of them could be destroyed, the plane must crash. There\ncame a terrific crash--a flare of light--and splintered fragments of\nflaming wreckage plummeted down. Yet the mighty blades continued\nwhirling as smoothly as ever!\n\nWhat could the _Solarite_ do against the giant monoplane? Evidently\nArcot had a plan. Under his touch their machine darted high into the sky\nabove the great plane. There was a full mile between them when he\nreleased the sustaining force of the _Solarite_ and let it drop,\nstraight toward the source of the battle--falling freely, ever more and\nmore rapidly. They were rushing at the mighty plane below at a pace that\nmade their hearts seem to pause--then suddenly Arcot cried out, \"Hold\non--here we stop!\"\n\nThey seemed a scant hundred feet from the broad metal wings of the\nunsuspecting plane, when suddenly there was a tremendous jerk, and each\nman felt himself pressed to the floor beneath a terrific weight that\nmade their backs crack with the load. Doggedly they fought to retain\ntheir senses; the blackness receded.\n\nBelow them they saw only a mighty sea of roaring red flames--a hell of\nblazing gas that roared like a score of bombs set off at once. The\n_Solarite_ was sitting down on her rocket jets! All six of the rocket\ntubes in the base of the ship had been opened wide, and streaming from\nthem in a furious blast of incandescent gas, the atomic hydrogen shot\nout in a mighty column of gas at 3500 degrees centigrade. Where the gas\ntouched it, the great plane flared to incandescence; and in an\nimmeasurable interval the fall of the _Solarite_ ended, and it rebounded\nhigh into the air. Arcot, struggling against the weight of six\ngravities, pulled shut the little control that had sent those mighty\ntorches blasting out. An instant later they sped away lest the plane\nshoot toward the gas columns.\n\nFrom a safe distance they looked back at their work. No longer was the\nmighty plane unscathed, invulnerable, for now in its top gaped six great\ncraters of incandescent metal that almost touched and coalesced. The\ngreat plane itself reeled, staggering, plunging downward; but long\nbefore it reached the hard soil below, it was brought into level flight,\nand despite many dead engines, it circled and fled toward the south. The\nhorde of small planes followed, dropping a rain of bombs into the\nglowing pits in the ship, releasing their fury in its interior. In\nmoments the beings manning the marauder had to a large extent recovered\nfrom the shock of the attack and were fighting back. In a moment--just\nbefore the ship passed over the horizon and out of sight--the\nTerrestrians saw the great props that had been idle, suddenly leap into\nmotion, and in an instant the giant had left its attackers\nbehind--fleeing from its invisible foe.\n\nUnder Arcot's guidance the ship from Earth, still invisible, returned to\nthe approximate spot where they had destroyed the invulnerability of the\nGiant. Then suddenly, out of nothing, the _Solarite_ appeared. In an\ninstant a dozen of the tiny two-man planes darted toward it. Just that\nthey might recognize it, Arcot shot it up a bit higher with the aid of\nthe keel rockets at one-third power. The typical reddish flame of atomic\nhydrogen, he knew, would be instantaneously recognizable.\n\nLittle these planes were, but shaped like darts, and swifter than any\nplane of Earth. They shot along at 1000 miles an hour readily, as Arcot\nsoon found out. It was not a minute before they had formed a long line\nthat circled the _Solarite_ at minimum speed, then started off in the\ndirection of the city. On impulse Arcot followed after them, and\ninstantly the planes increased their velocity, swiftly reaching 1000\nmiles per hour.\n\nThe city they were approaching was an inspiring sight. Mighty towers\nswept graceful lines a half mile in the air, their brightly colored\nwalls gleaming in rainbow hues, giving the entire city the aspect of a\ngigantic jewel--a single architectural unit. Here was symmetry and\norder, with every unit in the city built around the gigantic central\nedifice that rose, a tremendous tower of black and gold, a full half\nmile in the air.\n\nThe outer parts of the city were evidently the residential districts,\nthe low buildings and the wide streets with the little green lawns\nshowing the care of the individual owner. Then came the apartment houses\nand the small stores; these rose in gentle slopes, higher and higher,\nmerging at last with the mighty central pinnacle of beauty. The city was\ndesigned as a whole, not in a multitude of individually beautiful, but\ninharmonious units, like some wild mixture of melodies, each in itself\nbeautiful, but mutually discordant.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nThe Terrestrians followed their escort high above these great buildings,\nheading toward the great central tower. In a moment they were above it,\nand in perfect order the ships of the Venerians shot down to land\nsmoothly, but at high speed. On the roof of the building they slowed\nwith startling rapidity, held back by electromagnets under the top\ndressing of the roof landing, as Arcot learned later.\n\n\"We can't land on that--this thing weighs too much--we'd probably sink\nright through it! The street looks wide enough for us to land there.\"\nArcot maneuvered the _Solarite_ over the edge of the roof, and dropped\nit swiftly down the half mile to the ground below. Just above the\nstreet, he leveled off, and descended slowly, giving the hurrying crowds\nplenty of time to get from beneath it.\n\nLanding finally, he looked curiously at the mass of Venerians who had\ngathered in the busy street, coming out of buildings where they\nevidently had sought shelter during the raid. The crowd grew rapidly as\nthe Terrestrians watched them--people of a new world.\n\n\"Why,\" exclaimed Fuller in startled surprise, \"they look almost like\nus!\"\n\n\"Why not?\" laughed Arcot. \"Is there any particular reason why they\nshouldn't look like us? Venus and Earth are very nearly the same size,\nand are planets of the same parent sun. Physical conditions here appear\nto be very similar to conditions back home, and if there's anything to\nSvend Arrehenius' theory of life spores being sent from world to world\nby sunlight, there's no reason why humanoid races cannot be found\nthroughout the universe. On worlds, that is, suitable for the\ndevelopment of such life forms.\"\n\n\"Look at the size of 'em,\" Fuller commented.\n\nTheir size was certainly worth noting, for in all that crowd only the\nobviously young were less than six feet tall. The average seemed to be\nseven feet--well-built men and women with unusually large chests, who\nwould have seemed very human indeed, but for a ghastly, death-like blue\ntinge to their skin. Even their lips were as bright a blue as man's lips\nare red. The teeth seemed to be as white as any human's, but their\nmouths were blue.\n\n\"They look as if they'd all been eating blueberries!\" laughed Wade. \"I\nwonder what makes their blood blue? I've heard of blue-blooded families,\nbut these are the first I've ever seen!\"\n\n\"I think I can answer that,\" said Morey slowly. \"It seems odd to us--but\nthose people evidently have their blood based on hemocyanin. In us, the\noxygen is carried to the tissues, and the carbon dioxide carried away by\nan iron compound, hemoglobin, but in many animals of Earth, the same\nfunction is performed by a copper compound, hemocyanin, which is an\nintense blue. I am sure that that is the explanation for these strange\npeople. By the way, did you notice their hands?\"\n\n\"Yes, I had. They strike me as having one too many fingers--look\nthere--that fellow is pointing--why--his hand hasn't too many fingers,\nbut too many thumbs! He has one on each side of his palm! Say, that\nwould be handy in placing nuts and bolts, and such fine work, wouldn't\nit?\"\n\nSuddenly a lane opened in the crowd, and from the great black and gold\nbuilding there came a file of men in tight-fitting green uniforms; a\nfile of seven-foot giants. Obviously they were soldiers of some\nparticular branch, for in the crowd there were a number of men dressed\nin similar uniforms of deep blue.\n\n\"I think they want one or more of us to accompany them,\" Arcot said.\n\"Let's flip a coin to decide who goes--two better stay here, and two go.\nIf we don't come back inside of a reasonable period of time, one of you\nmight start making inquiries; the other can send a message to Earth, and\nget out of harm's way till help can come. I imagine these people are\nfriendly now, however--else I wouldn't go.\"\n\nThe leader of the troop stepped up to the door of the _Solarite_, and\ncoming to what was obviously a position of attention, put his left hand\nover his right breast in an equally obvious salute, and waited.\n\nThe coin was flipped with due ceremony--it would decide which of them\nwere to have the distinction of being the first Terrestrians to set foot\non Venus. Arcot and Morey won, and they quickly put on the loose-fitting\nventilated cooling suits that they might live comfortably in the hot air\noutside--for the thermometer registered 150\u00b0!\n\nThe two men quickly walked over to the airlock, entered, closed it\nbehind them, and opened the outer door. There was a slight rush of air,\nas the pressure outside was a bit lower than that inside. There was a\nsinging in their ears, and they had to swallow several times to equalize\nthe pressure.\n\nThe guards at once fell into a double row on either side of them, and\nthe young officer strode ahead. He himself had curbed his curiosity\nafter the single startled glance he had given these strange men. Only\ntheir hands were visible, for the cooling suits covered them almost\ncompletely, but the strange pink color must indeed have been startling\nto the eyes; also their dwarf stature, and the strange suits they wore.\nThe men of his little troop, however, as well as the people in the crowd\nabout them, were not so disinterested. They were looking in eager\namazement at these men who had just saved their city, these strange\nsmall men with their queer pink skin. And most surprising of all,\nperhaps, the inner thumb was missing from each hand!\n\nBut soon they had passed beyond the sight of the crowd, which was held\nin check by a handful of the deep blue uniformed men.\n\n\"Those fellows would never hold such a Terrestrial crowd back if\nvisitors from another planet landed!\" remarked Morey wonderingly.\n\n\"How do they know we are visitors from another planet?\" Arcot objected.\n\"We suddenly appeared out of nowhere--they don't even know our direction\nof approach. We might be some strange race of Venerians as far as they\nknow.\"\n\nThey walked briskly up to the massive gold and black entrance, and\npassed through the great doors that seemed made of solid copper, painted\nwith some clear coating that kept the metal lustrous, the rich color\nshining magnificently. They stood open wide now, as indeed they always\nwere. Even the giant Venerians were dwarfed by these mighty doors as\nthey passed through into an equally vast hall, a tremendous room that\nmust have filled all the front half of the ground floor of the gigantic\nbuilding, a hall of graceful columns that hid the great supporting\nmembers. The stone, they knew, must serve the Venerians as marble serves\nus, but it was a far more handsome stone. It was a rich green, like the\ngreen of thick, heavy grass in summer when the rain is plentiful. The\ncolor was very pleasing to the eye, and restful too. There was a\nchecker-board floor of this green stone, alternated with another, a\nstone of intense blue. They were hard, and the colors made a very\nstriking pattern, pleasingly different from what they had been\naccustomed to, but common to Venus, as they later learned.\n\nAt last the party had crossed the great hall, and stopped beside a large\ndoorway. The officer halted for a moment, and gestured toward two of his\nmen, who remained, while the others walked quickly away. The diminished\nparty stepped through the doorway into a small room whose walls were\nlined with copper, and an instant later, as the officer pushed a small\nbutton, there was a low hiss of escaping air, and a copper grating\nsprang quickly up across the opening of the elevator. He touched another\nbutton, and there was the familiar sinking feeling as the car rose, a\nlow hum seeming to come from its base.\n\nThe elevator rose swiftly through a very considerable distance--up--up,\nendlessly.\n\n\"They must have some wonderfully strong cables here on Venus!\" Morey\nexclaimed. \"The engineers of Terrestrial buildings have been wondering\nfor some time how to get around the difficulty of shifting elevators.\nThe idea of changing cars doesn't appeal to me, either--but we must have\nrisen a long way!\"\n\n\"I should say so--I wonder how they do it. We've been rising for a\nminute and a half at a very fair clip--there we are; end of the line--I\nwant to look at this car!\" Arcot stepped over to the control board,\nlooked at it closely, then stepped out and peered down between the car\nand the shaft as the copper grating fell, simultaneously pulling down\nwith it the door that had blocked off the hallway.\n\n\"Come here, Morey--simple system at that! It would be so, of course.\nLook--they have tracks, and a regular trolley system, with cog rails\nalongside, and the car just winds itself up! They have a motor\nunderneath, I'll bet, and just run it up in that way. They have never\ndone that on Earth because of the cost of running the car up without too\nmuch power. I think I see the solution--the car has electro-dynamical\nbrakes, and descending, just slows itself down by pumping power into the\nline to haul some other car up. This is a mighty clever scheme!\"\n\nAs Arcot straightened, the officer beckoned to him to follow, and\nstarted down the long corridor which was lined on either side with large\ndoorways, much like a very exotic earthly office building. Passing\nthrough a long series of branching corridors they at last reached one\nthat terminated in a large office, into which the young officer led\nthem. Snapping to attention, he spoke briefly and rapidly, saluted and\nretired with his two men.\n\nThe man before whom the Terrestrians stood was a tall, kindly-faced old\ngentleman. His straight black hair was tinged with bluish gray, and the\nkindly face bore the lines of age, but the smiling eyes, and the air of\nsincere interest gave his countenance an amazingly youthful air. It was\nwarm and friendly despite its disconcerting blueness. He looked\ncuriously, questioningly at the two men before him, looked at their\nhands, his eyes widening in surprise; then he stepped quickly forward,\nand extended his hand, at the same time looking toward Arcot.\n\nSmiling, Arcot extended his own. The Venerian grasped it--then with an\nexclamation on the part of each, they mutually released each other,\nArcot feeling an uncomfortable sensation of heat, just as the Venerian\nfelt a flash of intense cold! Each stared from his hand to the hand of\nthe other in surprise, then a smile curved the blue lips of the Venerian\nas he very emphatically put his hand at his side. Arcot smiled in turn,\nand said to Morey in an animated tone:\n\n\"They have a body temperature of at least 170\u00b0 Fahrenheit. It would\nnaturally be above room temperature, which is 150\u00b0 here, so that they\nare most unpleasantly hot to us. Marvelous how nature adapts herself to\nher surroundings!\" He chuckled. \"I hope these fellows don't have fevers.\nThey'd be apt to boil over!\"\n\nThe Venerian had picked up a small rectangle of black material, smooth\nand solid. He drew quickly upon it with what appeared to be a pencil of\ncopper. In a moment he handed the tablet to Arcot, who reached out for\nit, then changed his mind, and motioned that he didn't want to burn his\nfingers. The old Venerian held it where Arcot could see it.\n\n\"Why, Morey, look here--I didn't think they had developed astronomy to\nany degree, because of the constant clouds, but look at this. He has a\nnice little map of the solar system, with Mercury, Venus, Earth, the\nMoon, Mars, and all the rest on it. He has drawn in several of the\nsatellites of Jupiter and of Saturn too.\"\n\nThe Venerian pointed to Mars and looked inquisitively at them. Arcot\nshook his head and pointed quickly to Earth. The Venetian seemed a bit\nsurprised at this, then thought a moment and nodded in satisfaction. He\nlooked at Arcot intently. Then to the latter's amazement, there seemed\nto form in his mind a thought--at first vague, then quickly taking\ndefinite form.\n\n\"Man of Earth,\" it seemed to say, \"we thank you--you have saved our\nnation. We want to thank you for your quick response to our signals. We\nhad not thought that you could answer us so soon.\" The Venerian seemed\nto relax as the message was finished. It obviously had required great\nmental effort.\n\nArcot looked steadily into his eyes now, and tried to concentrate on a\nmessage--on a series of ideas. To him, trained though he was in deep\nconcentration on one idea, the process of visualizing a series of ideas\nwas new, and very difficult. But he soon saw that he was making some\nprogress.\n\n\"We came in response to no signals--exploration only--we saw the\nbattle--and aided because your city seemed doomed, and because it seemed\ntoo beautiful to be destroyed.\"\n\n\"What's it all about, Arcot?\" asked Morey wonderingly, as he watched\nthem staring at each other.\n\n\"Mental telepathy,\" Arcot answered briefly. \"I'm terribly thick from his\npoint of view, but I just learned that they sent signals to Earth--why,\nI haven't learned--but I'm making progress. If I don't crack under the\nstrain, I'll find out sooner or later--so wait and see.\" He turned again\nto the Venerian.\n\nThe latter was frowning at him rather dubiously. With sudden decision he\nturned to his desk, and pulled down a small lever. Then again he looked\nintently at Arcot.\n\n\"Come with me--the strain of this conversation is too great--I see you\ndo not have thought transference on your world.\"\n\n\"Come along, Morey--we're going somewhere. He says this thought\ntransference is too much for us. I wonder what he is going to do?\"\n\nOut into the maze of halls they went again, now led by the kindly\nseven-foot Venerian. After walking through a long series of halls, they\nreached a large auditorium, where already there had gathered in the\nsemi-circle of seats a hundred or so of the tall, blue-tinged Venerians.\nBefore them, on a low platform, were two large, deeply-cushioned chairs.\nTo these chairs the two Terrestrians were led.\n\n\"We will try to teach you our language telepathically. We can give you\nthe ideas--you must learn the pronunciation, but this will be very much\nquicker. Seat yourselves in these chairs and relax.\"\n\nThe chairs had been designed for the seven-footers. These men were six\nfeet and six feet six, respectively, yet it seemed to them, as they sank\ninto the cushions, that never had they felt such comfortable chairs.\nThey were designed to put every muscle and every nerve at rest.\nLuxuriously, almost in spite of themselves, they relaxed.\n\nDimly Arcot felt a wave of sleepiness sweep over him; he yawned\nprodigiously. There was no conscious awareness of his sinking into a\ndeep slumber. It seemed that suddenly visions began to fill his\nmind--visions that developed with a returning consciousness--up from the\ndark, into a dream world. He saw a mighty fleet whose individual planes\nwere a mile long, with three-quarters of a mile wingspread--titanic\nmonoplanes, whose droning thunder seemed to roar through all space. Then\nsuddenly they were above him, and from each there spurted a great stream\nof dazzling brilliance, an intense glow that reached down, and touched\nthe city. An awful concussion blasted his ears. All the world about him\nerupted in unimaginable brilliance; then darkness fell.\n\nAnother vision filled his mind--a vision of the same fleet hanging over\na giant crater of molten rock, a crater that gaped angrily in a plain\nbeside low green hills--a crater that had been a city. The giants of the\nair circled, turned, and sped over the horizon. Again he was with\nthem--and again he saw a great city fuse in a blazing flash of blinding\nlight--again and yet again--until around all that world he saw smoking\nruins of great cities, now blasted crimson craters in a world of fearful\ndesolation.\n\nThe destroyers rode up, up, up--out of the clouds--and he was with them.\nOut beyond the swirling mists, where the cold of space seemed to reach\nin at them, and the roaring of the mighty propellers was a thin\nwhine--then suddenly that was gone, and from the tail of each of the\ntitanic machines there burst a great stream of light, a blazing column\nthat roared back, and lit all space for miles around--rocket jets that\nsent them swiftly across space!\n\nHe saw them approaching another world, a world that shone a dull red,\nbut he saw the markings and knew that it was Earth, not Mars. The great\nplanes began falling now--falling at an awful speed into the upper air\nof the planet, and in an instant the rocket flares were gone, fading and\ndying in the dense air. Again there came the roar of the mighty\npropellers. Then swiftly the fleet of giants swooped down, lower and\nlower. He became aware of its destination--a spot he knew must be New\nYork--but a strangely distorted New York--a Venerian city, where New\nYork should have been. And again, the bombs rained down. In an instant\nthe gigantic city was a smoking ruin.\n\nThe visions faded, and slowly he opened his eyes, looked about him. He\nwas still in the room of the circle of chairs--he was still on\nVenus--then with sudden shock, understanding came. He knew the meaning\nof these visions--the meaning of that strangely distorted New York, of\nthat red earth. It meant that this was what the Venerians believed was\nto happen! They were trying to show him the plans of the owners and\nbuilders of those gigantic ships! The New York he had seen was New York\nas these men imagined it.\n\nStartled, confused, his forehead furrowed, he rose unsteadily to his\nfeet. His head seemed whirling in the throes of a terrific headache. The\nmen about him were looking anxiously at him. He glanced toward Morey. He\nwas sleeping deeply in the seat, his features now and again reflecting\nhis sensations. It was his turn to learn this new language and see the\nvisions.\n\nThe old Venerian who had brought them there walked up to Arcot and spoke\nto him in a softly musical language, a language that was sibilant and\npredominated in liquid sounds; there were no gutturals, no nasals; it\nwas a more musical language than Earth men had ever before heard, and\nnow Arcot started in surprise, for he understood it perfectly; the\nlanguage was as familiar as English.\n\n\"We have taught you our language as quickly as possible--you may have a\nheadache, but you must know what we know as soon as possible. It may\nwell be that the fate of two worlds hangs on your actions. These men\nhave concentrated on you and taught you very rapidly with the massed\npower of their minds, giving you visions of what we know to be in\npreparation. You must get back to your wonderful ship as quickly as\npossible; and yet you must know what has happened here on our world in\nthe last few years, as well as what happened twenty centuries ago.\n\n\"Come with me to my office, and we will talk. When your friend has also\nlearned, you may tell him.\"\n\nQuickly Arcot followed the Venerian down the long corridors of the\nbuilding. The few people they met seemed intent on their own business,\npaying little attention to them.\n\nAt last they seated themselves in the office where Arcot had first met\nhis escort; and there he listened to a new history--the history of\nanother planet.\n\n\"My name is Tonlos,\" the old man said. \"I am a leader of my\npeople--though my title and position are unimportant. To explain would\nentail a prolonged discussion of our social structure, and there is no\ntime for that. Later, perhaps--but now to our history.\n\n\"Twenty centuries ago,\" Tonlos continued, \"there were two great rival\nnations on this planet. The planet Turo is naturally divided so that\nthere would be a tendency toward such division. There are two enormous\nbelts of land around the globe, one running from about 20 degrees north\nof the equator to about 80 degrees north. This is my country, Lanor. To\nthe south there is a similar great belt of land, of almost identical\nsize, Kaxor. These two nations have existed for many thousands of our\nyears.\n\n\"Two thousand years ago a great crisis arose in the affairs of the\nworld--a great war was in process of starting--but a Lanorian developed\na weapon that made it impossible for the Kaxorians to win--and war was\naverted. The feeling was so strong, however, that laws were passed which\nstopped all intercourse between the two nations for these thousands of\nyears. By devious ways we've learned that Kaxor has concentrated on the\nstudy of physics, perhaps in hopes of finding a weapon with which they\ncould threaten us once more. Lanor has studied the secrets of the human\nmind and body. We have no disease here any longer; we have no insanity.\nWe are students of chemistry, but physics has been neglected to a great\nextent. Recently, however, we have again taken up this science, since it\nalone of the main sciences had not received our study. Only twenty-five\nyears have been spent on these researches, and in that short time we\ncannot hope to do what the Kaxorians have done in two thousand.\n\n\"The secret of the heat ray, the weapon that prevented the last war, had\nbeen almost forgotten. It required diligent research to bring it to life\nagain, for it is a very inefficient machine--or was. Of late, however,\nwe have been able to improve it, and now it is used in commerce to smelt\nour ores. It was this alone that allowed this city to put up the slight\nresistance that we did. We were surely doomed. This is the capital of\nLanor, Sonor. We--and the nation--would have fallen but for you.\n\n\"We have had some warning that this was coming. We have spies in Kaxor\nnow, for we learned of their intentions when they flew the first of\ntheir giant planes over one of our cities and dropped a bomb! We have\nbeen trying, since we discovered the awful scope of their plans, to send\nyou a warning if you could not help us. That you should come here at\nthis particular time is almost beyond belief--a practically impossible\ncoincidence--but perhaps there is more than coincidence behind it? Who\nknows?\" He paused briefly; went on with a heavy sigh: \"Since you drove\nthat plane away, we can expect a new raid at any moment, and we must be\nprepared. Is there any way you can signal your planet?\"\n\n\"Yes--we can signal easily,\" Arcot answered; he struggled with the newly\nacquired language. \"I do not know the word in your tongue--it may be\nthat you do not have it--radio we call it--it is akin to light, but of\nvastly longer wavelength. Produced electrically, it can be directed like\nlight and sent in a beam by means of a reflection. It can penetrate all\nsubstances except metals, and can leak around them, if it be not\ndirectional. With it I can talk readily with the men of Earth, and this\nvery night I will.\"\n\nArcot paused, frowning thoughtfully, then continued, \"I know there's\ndefinite need for haste, but we can't do anything until Morey has\nreceived the knowledge you've given me. While we're waiting here, I\nmight just as well learn all I can about your planet. The more I know,\nthe more intelligently I'll be able to plan for our defense.\"\n\nIn the conversation which followed, Arcot gained a general knowledge of\nthe physical makeup of Venus. He learned that iron was an exceedingly\nrare element on the planet, while platinum was relatively plentiful.\nGold, though readily available, was considered a nuisance, since it was\nof no practical value due to its softness, excessive weight and its\naffinity for many catalysts. Most of the other metallic elements were\npresent in quantities approximating those of Earth, except for an\nelement called \"morlus\". When Tonlos mentioned this, Arcot said:\n\n\"Morlus--I have the word in your language--but I do not know the\nelement. What is it?\"\n\n\"Why--here is some!\"\n\nTonlos handed Arcot a small block of metal that had been used as a\nweight on a table in one corner of the room. It seemed fairly dense,\nabout as heavy as iron, but it had a remarkably bluish tint. Obviously,\nit was the element that composed the wings of the airplane they had\nseen that afternoon. Arcot examined it carefully, handicapped somewhat\nby its heat. He picked up a small copper rod and tried to scratch it but\nthere was no noticeable effect.\n\n\"You cannot scratch it with copper,\" said Tonlos. \"It is the second\nhardest metal we know--it is not as hard as chromium, but far less\nbrittle. It is malleable, ductile, very very strong, very tough,\nespecially when alloyed with iron, but those alloys are used only in\nvery particular work because of iron's rarity.\"\n\nIndicating the bluish block, Arcot said, \"I'd like to identify this\nelement. May I take it back to the ship and test it?\"\n\n\"You may, by all means. You will have considerable difficulty getting it\ninto solution, however. It is attacked only by boiling selenic acid\nwhich, as you must know, dissolves platinum readily. The usual test for\nthe element is to so dissolve it, oxidize it to an acid, then test with\nradium selenate, when a brilliant greenish blue salt is--\"\n\n\"Test with radium selenate!\" Arcot exclaimed. \"Why, we have no radium\nsalts whatever on Earth that we could use for that purpose. Radium is\nexceedingly rare!\"\n\n\"Radium is by no means plentiful here,\" Tonlos replied, \"but we seldom\nhave to test for morlus, and we have plenty of radium salts for that\npurpose. We have never found any other use for radium--it is so active\nthat it combines with water just as sodium does; it is very soft--a\nuseless metal, and dangerous to handle. Our chemists have never been\nable to understand it--it is always in some kind of reaction no matter\nwhat they do, and still it gives off that very light gas, helium, and a\nheavy gas, niton, and an unaccountable amount of heat.\"\n\n\"Your world is vastly different from ours,\" Arcot commented. He told\nTonlos of the different metals of Earth, the non-metals, and their\noccurrence. But try as he would, he could not place the metal Tonlos had\ngiven him.\n\nMorey's arrival interrupted their discussion. He looked very tired, and\nvery serious. His head ached from his unwonted mental strain, just as\nArcot's had. Briefly Arcot told him what he had learned, concluding with\na question as to why Morey thought the two planets, both members of the\nsame solar family, should be so different.\n\n\"I have an idea,\" said Morey slowly, \"and it doesn't seem _too_ wacky.\nAs you know, by means of solar photography, astronomers have mapped the\nsun, charting the location of the different elements. We've seen\nhydrogen, oxygen, silicon and others, and as the sun aged, the elements\nmust have been mixed up more and more thoroughly. Yet we have seen the\nvast areas of single elements. Some of those areas are so vast that they\ncould easily be the source of an entire world! I wonder if it is not\npossible that Earth was thrown off from some deposit rich in iron,\naluminum and calcium, and poor in gold, radium and those other\nmetals--and particularly poor in one element. We have located in the sun\nthe spectrum of an element we have named coronium--and I think you have\na specimen of coronium in your hand there! I'd say Venus came from a\ncoronium-rich region!\"\n\nThe discussion ended there, for already the light outside had deepened\nto a murky twilight. The Terrestrians were led quickly down to the\nelevator, which dropped them rapidly to the ground. There was still a\nlarge crowd about the _Solarite_, but the way was quickly cleared for\nthem. As the men passed through the crowd, a peculiar sensation struck\nthem very forcibly. It seemed that everyone in the crowd was wishing\nthem the greatest success--the best of good things in every wish.\n\n\"The ultimate in applause! Morey, I'll swear we just received a silent\ncheer!\" exclaimed Arcot, as they stood inside the airlock of the ship\nonce more. It seemed home to them now! In a moment they had taken off\nthe uncomfortable ventilating suits and stepped once more into the room\nwhere Wade and Fuller awaited them.\n\n\"Say--what were you fellows doing?\" Wade demanded. \"We were actually\ngetting ready to do some inquiring about your health!\"\n\n\"I know we were gone a long time--but when you hear the reason you'll\nagree it was worth it. See if you can raise Earth on the radio, Morey,\nwill you, while I tell these fellows what happened? If you succeed, tell\nthem to call in Dad and your father, and to have a couple of tape\nrecorders on the job. We'll want a record of what I have to send. Say\nthat we'll call back in an hour.\" Then, while Morey was busy down in the\npower room sending the signals out across the forty million miles of\nspace that separated them from their home planet, Arcot told Wade and\nFuller what they had learned.\n\nMorey finally succeeded in getting his message through, and returned to\nsay that they would be waiting in one hour. He had had to wait eight\nminutes after sending his message to get any answer, however, due to\ntime required for radio waves to make the two-way trip.\n\n\"Fuller,\" Arcot said, \"as chef, suppose you see what you can concoct\nwhile Wade and I start on this piece of coronium and see what there is\nto learn.\"\n\nAt the supper table Wade and Arcot reported to the others the curious\nconstants they had discovered for coronium. It was not attacked by any\nacid except boiling selenic acid, since it formed a tremendous number of\ninsoluble salts. Even the nitrate violated the long-held rule that \"all\nnitrates are soluble\"--it wouldn't dissolve. Yet it was chemically more\nactive than gold.\n\nBut its physical constants were the most surprising. It melted at 2800\u00b0\ncentigrade, a very high melting point indeed. Very few metals are solid\nat that temperature. But the tensile strength test made with a standard\nbar they finally turned out by means of a carbaloy tool, gave a reading\nof more than one million, three hundred thousand pounds per square inch!\nIt was far stronger than iron--stronger than tungsten, the strongest\nmetal heretofore known. It was twice as strong as the Earth's strongest\nmetal!\n\nFuller whistled in awe. \"No wonder they can make a plane like that when\nthey have such a metal to work with.\" The designing engineer had visions\nof a machine after his own heart--one in which half the weight was\n_not_ employed in holding it together!\n\nIt was a little later that they got communication through to Earth, and\nthe men went to the power room. The television screen was struggling to\nform a clear image despite the handicap of forty million miles of space.\nIn a moment it had cleared, though, and they saw the face of Dr. Arcot.\nHe showed plainly that he was worried about the startling news that had\nreached him already, sketchy though it was. After brief though warm\ngreetings, his son rapidly outlined to him the full extent of their\ndiscoveries, and the force that Earth would have to meet.\n\n\"Dad, these Kaxorians have planes capable of far more than a thousand\nmiles an hour in the air. For some reason the apparatus they use to\npropel them in space is inoperative in air, but their propellers will\ndrive them forward faster than any plane Earth ever saw. You must start\nat once on a fleet of these molecular motion planes--and a lot of the\ngas Wade developed--you know how to make it--the animation suspending\ngas. They don't have it--and I believe it will be useful. I'll try to\ndevelop some new weapons here. If either of us makes any progress along\nnew lines--we'll report to the other. I must stop now--a Lanorian\ndelegation is coming.\" After a few words of farewell, Arcot severed\nconnections with the Earth and arose to await the arrival of the\nvisitors.\n\nSince the return of the Terrestrians to the _Solarite_, a great crowd of\nVenerians had gathered around it, awaiting a glimpse of the men, for the\nnews had spread that this ship had come from Earth. Now, the crowd had\ndivided, and a group of men was approaching, clothed in great heavy\ncoats that seemed warm enough to wear in Terrestrial arctic regions!\n\n\"Why--Arcot--what's the idea of the winter regalia?\" asked Fuller in\nsurprise.\n\n\"Think a moment--they are going to visit a place whose temperature is\nseventy degrees colder than their room temperature. In the bargain,\nVenus never has any seasonal change of temperature, and a heavy bank of\nclouds that eternally cover the planet keeps the temperature as constant\nas a thermocouple arrangement could. The slight change from day to night\nis only appreciable by the nightly rains--see--the crowd is beginning to\nbreak up now. It's night already, and there is a heavy dew settling.\nSoon it will be rain, and the great amount of moisture in the air will\nsupply enough heat, in condensing, to prevent a temperature drop of more\nthan two or three degrees. These men are not used to changes in\ntemperature as we are and hence they must protect themselves far more\nfully.\"\n\nThree figures now entered the airlock of the _Solarite_, and muffled in\nheavy garments as they were, large under any conditions, they had to\ncome through one at a time.\n\nMuch that Arcot showed them was totally new to them. Much he could not\nexplain to them at all, for their physics had not yet reached that\nstage.\n\nBut there was one thing he could show them, and he did. There were no\nsamples of the liquids he wanted, but their chemistry was developed to a\npoint that permitted the communication of the necessary data and Arcot\ntold them the formula of Wade's gas. Its ability to penetrate any\nmaterial at ordinary temperatures, combined with its anesthetic\nproperties, gave it obvious advantages as a weapon for rendering the\nopposing forces defenseless.\n\nSince it was able to penetrate all substances, there was no means of\nstoring it. Hence it was made in the form of two liquids which reacted\nspontaneously and produced the gas, which was then projected to the spot\nwhere needed.\n\nArcot asked now that the Venerian chemists make him a supply of these\ntwo liquids; and they promptly agreed. He felt he would have a fighting\nchance in combatting the enemy if he could but capture one of their\nflying forts. It seemed a strange task! Capturing so huge a machine with\nonly the tiny _Solarite_--but Arcot felt there was a good possibility of\nhis doing it if he but had a supply of that gas.\n\nThere was one difficulty--one step in the synthesis required a\nconsiderable quantity of chlorine. Since chlorine was rare on Venus,\nthe men were forced to sacrifice most of their salt supply; but this\nchlorine so generated could be used over and over again.\n\nIt was quite late when the Venerians left, to go again into the scalding\nhot rain, rain that seemed to them to be a cold drizzle. After they had\ngone, the Terrestrians turned in for the night, leaving a telephone\nconnection with the armed guard outside.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe dull light of the Venerian day was filtering in through the windows\nthe next morning when the Terrestrians awoke. It was eight o'clock, New\nYork time, but Sonor was working on a twenty-three hour day. It happened\nthat Sonor and New York had been in opposition at midnight two nights\nago, which meant that it was now ten o'clock Sonorian time. The result\nwas that Arcot left the car to speak to the officer in charge of the\nguard about the ship.\n\n\"We need some pure water--water free of copper salts. I think it would\nbe best if you can get me some water that has been distilled. That is,\nfor drinking. Also we need about two tons of water of any kind--the\nship's tanks need recharging. I'd like about a ton of the drinking\nwater.\" Arcot had to translate the Terrestrian measures into the\ncorresponding Venerian terms, of course, but still the officer seemed\npuzzled. Such a large amount of water would create a real problem in\ntransportation. After apparently conferring by telepathic means with his\nsuperiors, the officer asked if the _Solarite_ could be moved to some\nmore accessible place.\n\nArcot agreed to have it moved to a spot just outside the city, where the\nwater could be procured directly from a stream. The drinking water would\nbe ready when he returned to the city.\n\nThe _Solarite_ was moved to the bank of the little river and the\nelectrolysis apparatus was set up beside it. During the previous day,\nand ever since they had landed on Venus, all their power had been coming\nfrom the storage cells, but now that the electrolysis apparatus was to\nestablish such a heavy and constant drain, Arcot started the generator,\nto both charge the cells, and to do the work needed.\n\nThroughout the day there could be heard the steady hum of the generator,\nand the throb-throb-throb of the oxygen pump, as the gas was pumped into\nthe huge tanks. The apparatus they were using produced the gas very\nrapidly, but it was near nightfall before the huge tanks had again been\nfilled. Even then there was a bit more room for the atomic hydrogen that\nwas simultaneously formed, although twice as much hydrogen as oxygen was\nproduced. Its task completed, the _Solarite_ rose again and sped toward\nthe distant city.\n\nA soft red glow filled the sky now, for even through the miles of clouds\nthe intense sun was able to force some direct rays, and all the city was\nlighted with that warm radiance. The floodlights had not yet been turned\non, but the great buildings looming high in the ruddy light were\nwonderfully impressive, the effect being heightened by the planned\nconstruction, for there were no individual spires, only a single mass\nthat grew from the ground to tower high in the air, like some man-made\nmountain.\n\nBack at the Capital the _Solarite_ again settled into the broad avenue\nthat had been cut off to traffic now, and allotted to it as its resting\nplace. Tonlos met them shortly after they had settled into place, and\nwith him were five men, each carrying two large bottles.\n\n\"Ah-co,\" as Tonlos pronounced the Terrestrian name, \"we have not been\nable to make very much of the materials needed for your gas, but before\nwe made any very great amount, we tried it out on an animal, whose blood\nstructure is the same as ours, and found it had the same effect, but\nthat in our case the iodide of potassium is not as effective in\nawakening the victim as is the sorlus. I do not know whether you have\ntried that on Terrestrial animals or not. Luckily sorlus is the most\nplentiful of the halogen groups; we have far more of it than of\nchlorine, bromine or iodine.\"\n\n\"Sorlus? I do not know of it--it must be one of the other elements that\nwe do not have on Earth. What are its properties?\"\n\n\"It, too, is much like iodine, but heavier. It is a black solid melting\nat 570 degrees; it is a metallic looking element, will conduct\nelectricity somewhat, oxidizes in air to form an acidic oxide, and forms\nstrong oxygen acids. It is far less active than iodine, except toward\noxygen. It is very slightly soluble in water. It does not react readily\nwith hydrogen, and the acid where formed is not as strong as HI.\"\n\n\"I have seen so many new things here, I wonder if it may not be the\nelement that precedes niton. Is it heavier than that?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Tonlos; \"it is just lighter than that element you call\nniton. I think you have none of it.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Arcot, \"it must be the next member of the halogen series,\nMorey. I'll bet they have a number of those heavier elements.\"\n\nThe gas was loaded aboard the _Solarite_ that evening, and when Wade saw\nthe quantity that they had said was \"rather disappointingly small\" he\nlaughed heartily.\n\n\"Small! They don't know what that gas will do! There's enough stuff\nthere to gas this whole city. Why, with that, we can bring down any\nship! But tell them to go on making it, for we can use it on the other\nships.\"\n\nAgain that night they spoke with Earth, and Morey, Senior, told them\nthat work was already under way on a hundred small ships. They were\nusing all their own ships already, while the Government got ready to act\non the idea of danger. It had been difficult to convince them that\nsomeone on Venus was getting ready to send a force to Earth to destroy\nthem; but the weight of their scientific reputation had turned the\ntrick. The ships now under construction would be ready in three weeks.\nThey would be unable to go into space, but they would be very fast, and\ncapable of carrying large tanks of the gas-producing chemicals.\n\nIt was near midnight, Venerian time, when they turned in. The following\nday they planned to start for the Kaxorian construction camp. They had\nlearned from Tonlos that there were but five of the giant planes\ncompleted now, but there were fifteen more under construction, to make\nup the fleet of twenty that was to attack Earth. These fifteen others\nwould be ready in a week--or less. When they were ready, the _Solarite_\nwould stand small chance. They must capture one of the giants and learn\nits secrets, and then, if possible, with the weapons and knowledge of\ntwo worlds, defeat them. A large order!\n\nTheir opportunity came sooner than they had hoped for--or wanted. It was\nabout three o'clock in the morning when the telephone warning hummed\nloudly through the ship. Arcot answered.\n\nFar to the east and south of them the line of scout planes that\npatrolled all the borders of Lanor had been broken. Instantaneously, it\nseemed, out of the dark, its lights obscured, the mighty Kaxorian craft\nhad come, striking a tiny scout plane head on, destroying it utterly\nbefore the scout had a chance to turn from the path of the titanic ship.\nBut even as the plane spun downward, the pilot had managed to release a\nmagnesium flare, a blindingly brilliant light that floated down on a\nparachute, and in the blaze of the white light it gave off, the other\nscouts at a few miles distance had seen the mighty bulk of the Kaxorian\nplane. At once they had dropped to the ground and then, by telephone\nlines, had sent their report to far off Sonor.\n\nIn moments the interior of the _Solarite_ became a scene of swift\npurposeful activity. All day the Terrestrians had been able to do so\nlittle in preparation for the conflict they knew must come, the battle\nfor two worlds. They had wanted action, but they had no weapons except\ntheir invisibility and the atomic hydrogen. It would not sink a plane.\nIt would only break open its armor, and they hoped, paralyze its crew.\nAnd on this alone they must pin their hopes.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nArcot lifted the _Solarite_ at once high into the air, and started\ntoward the point on the border, where the plane had been seen crossing.\nIn a short time Wade relieved him at the controls while he dressed.\n\nThey had been flying on in silence for about an hour, when suddenly Wade\nmade out in the distance the great bulk of the plane, against the dull\ngray of the clouds, a mile or so above them. It seemed some monstrous\nblack bat flying there against the sky, but down to the sensitive\nmicrophone on the side of the _Solarite_ came the drone of the hundred\nmighty propellers as the great plane forged swiftly along.\n\nJust how rapidly these giants moved, Arcot had not appreciated until he\nattempted to overtake this one. It was going over a mile a second now--a\nspeed that demanded only that it move its own length in about\nfive-eights of a second! It made this tremendous speed by streamlining\nand through sheer power.\n\nThe _Solarite_ hovered high above the dark ship at length, the roar of\nthe terrific air blast from its propellers below coming up to them as a\nmighty wave of sound that made their own craft tremble! The hundred\ngigantic propellers roaring below, however, would distribute their gas\nperfectly.\n\n\"We're going invisible,\" Arcot exclaimed. \"Look out!\" There was a click\nas the switch shut, and the _Solarite_ was as transparent as the air\nabove it. Arcot drove his ship swiftly, above and ahead of the mighty\ncolossus, then released the gas. There was a low hiss from the power\nroom, barely detectable despite the vacuum that shut them off from the\nroar of the Kaxorian plane. The microphone had long since been\ndisconnected. Out of the gas vent streamed a cloud of purplish gas,\nbecoming faintly visible as it left the influence of the invisibility\napparatus, but only to those who knew where to look for it. The men in\nthat mighty plane could not see it as their machine bore down into the\nlittle cloud of gas.\n\nTensely the Terrestrians waited. Moments--and the gigantic plane\nwobbled! There was a sudden swerve that ended in a nose dive, straight\ntoward Venus seven miles below.\n\nThat the ship should crash into the ground below was not at all Arcot's\nplan, and he was greatly relieved when it flattened its dive and started\nto climb, its incalculable mass rapidly absorbing its kinetic energy.\nDown from its seven mile height it glided, controlling itself perfectly\nas Arcot released the last of the first four containers of the liquid\ngas makers, putting to sleep the last man on the ship below.\n\nIn a long glide that carried it over many miles, the great ship\ndescended. It had sunk far, and gone smoothly, but now there loomed\nahead of it a range of low hills! It would certainly crash into the\nrocky cliffs ahead! Nearer and nearer drew the barrier while Arcot and\nthe others watched with rigid attention. It might skim above those low\nhills at that--just barely escaping.... The watchers cringed as head on,\nat nearly two thousand miles an hour, the machine crashed into the\nrocks. Arcot had snapped the loud speaker into the circuit once more,\nand now as they looked at the sudden crash below, there thundered up to\nthem mighty waves of sound!\n\nThe giant plane had struck about twenty feet from the top of a nearly\nperpendicular cliff. The terrific crash was felt by seismographs in\nSonor nearly two thousand miles away! The mighty armored hull plowed\ninto the rocks like some gigantic meteor, the hundreds of thousands of\ntons crushing the rocky precipice, grinding it to powder, and shaking\nthe entire hill. The cliff seemed to buckle and crack. In moments the\nplane had been brought to rest, but it had plowed through twenty feet of\nrock for nearly an eighth of a mile. For an instant it hung motionless,\nperched perilously in the air, its tail jutting out over the little\nvalley, then slowly, majestically it sank, to strike with a\nreverberating crash that shattered the heavy armor plate!\n\nFor another instant the great motors continued turning, the roar of the\npropellers like some throbbing background to the rending crashes as the\ntitanic wreck came to rest. Suddenly, with a series of roaring\nexplosions, the bank of motors in the left wing blew up with awful\nforce. There was a flash of indescribable brilliance that momentarily\nblinded the watching Terrestrians; then there came to the microphone\nsuch waves of sound as it could not reproduce. From the rock on which\nrested the fused mass of metal that they knew had been the wing, rose a\ngreat cloud of dust. Still the motors on the other side of the ship\ncontinued roaring and the giant propellers turned. As the blast of air\nblew the dust away, the Terrestrians stared in unbounded amazement. Up\nfrom the gaping, broken wing lanced a mighty beam of light of such\ndazzling intensity that Arcot swiftly restored them to visibility that\nthey might shut it out. There was a terrific hissing, crackling roar.\nThe plane seemed to wobble as it lay there, seemingly recoiling from\nthat flaming column. Where it touched the cliff there was intense\nincandescence that made the rock glow white hot, then flow down in a\nsluggish rivulet of molten lava! For five minutes longer this terrific\nspectacle lasted, while Arcot withdrew the _Solarite_ to a safer\ndistance.\n\nThe fifty motors of the remaining wing seemed slowing down now--then\nsuddenly there was such a crash and towering flash of light as no human\nbeing had ever seen before! Up--up into the very clouds it shot its\nmighty flame, a blazing column of light that seemed to reach out into\nspace. The _Solarite_ was hurled back end over end, tumbling, falling.\nEven the heavy gyroscopes could not hold it for an instant, but quickly\nthe straining motors brought them to rest in air that whirled and whined\nabout them. They were more than twenty miles from the scene of the\nexplosion, but even at that distance they could see the glow of the\nincandescent rock. Slowly, cautiously they maneuvered the _Solarite_\nback to the spot, and looked down on a sea of seething lava!\n\nMorey broke the awed silence. \"Lord--what power that thing carries! No\nwonder they could support it in the air! But--how can they control such\npower? What titanic forces!\"\n\nSlowly Arcot sent the _Solarite_ away into the night--into the kindly\ndarkness once more. His voice when he spoke at last was oddly\nrestrained.\n\n\"I wonder what those forces were--they are greater than any man has ever\nbefore seen! An entire hill fused to molten, incandescent rock, not to\nmention the tons and tons of metal that made up that ship.\n\n\"And such awful forces as these are to be released on our Earth!\" For an\ninterminable period they sat silent as the panorama of hills glided by\nat a slow two-hundred miles an hour. Abruptly Arcot exclaimed, \"We\n_must_ capture a ship. We'll try again--we'll either destroy or capture\nit--and either way we're ahead!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAimlessly they continued their leisurely course across a vast plain.\nThere were no great mountains on Venus, for this world had known no such\nviolent upheaval as the making of a moon. The men were lost in thought,\neach intent on his own ideas. At length Wade stood up, and walked slowly\nback to the power room.\n\nSuddenly the men in the control room heard his call:\n\n\"Arcot--quick--the microphone--and rise a mile!\"\n\nThe _Solarite_ gave a violent lurch as it shot vertically aloft at\ntremendous acceleration. Arcot reached over swiftly and snapped the\nswitch of the microphone. There burst in upon them the familiar roaring\ndrone of a hundred huge propellers. No slightest hum of motor, only the\nvast whining roar of the mighty props.\n\n\"Another one! They must have been following the first by a few minutes.\nWe'll get this one!\" Arcot worked swiftly at his switches. \"Wade--strap\nyourself in the seat where you are--don't take time to come up here.\"\n\nThey followed the same plan which had worked so well before. Suddenly\ninvisible, the _Solarite_ flashed ahead of the great plane. The titanic\nwave of rushing sound engulfed them--then again came the little hiss of\nthe gas. Now there were no hills in sight, as far as the eye could see.\nIn the dim light that seemed always to filter through these gray clouds\nthey could see the distant, level horizon.\n\nSeveral dragging minutes passed before there was any evident effect; the\nmen from Earth were waiting for that great ship to waver, to wobble from\nits course. Suddenly Arcot gave a cry of surprise. Startled amazement\nwas written all over his face, as his companions turned in wonderment to\nsee that he was partially visible! The _Solarite_, too, had become a\nmisty ghost ship about them; they were becoming visible! Then in an\ninstant it was gone--and they saw that the huge black bulk behind them\nwas wavering, turning; the thunderous roar of the propellers fell to a\nwhistling whine; the ship was losing speed! It dipped, and shot down a\nbit--gained speed, then step by step it glided down--down--down to the\nsurface below. The engines were idling now, the plane running more and\nmore slowly.\n\nThey were near the ground now--and the watchers scarcely breathed. Would\nthis ship, too, crash? It glided to within a half mile of the\nplain--then it dipped once more, and Arcot breathed his relief as it\nmade a perfect landing, the long series of rollers on the base of the\ngigantic hull absorbing the shock of the landing. There were small\nstreams in the way--a tree or two, but these were obstacles unnoticed by\nthe gargantuan machine. Its mighty propellers still idling slowly, the\nhuge plane rolled to a standstill.\n\nSwooping down, the _Solarite_ landed beside it, to be lost in the vast\nshadows of the mighty metal walls.\n\nArcot had left a small radio receiver with Tonlos in Sonor before he\nstarted on this trip, and had given him directions on how to tune in on\nthe _Solarite_. Now he sent a message to him, telling that the plane had\nbeen brought down, and asking that a squadron of planes be sent at once.\n\nWade and Arcot were elected to make the first inspection of the Kaxorian\nplane, and clad in their cooling suits, they stepped from the\n_Solarite_, each carrying, for emergency use, a small hand torch,\nburning atomic hydrogen, capable of melting its way through even the\nheavy armor of the great plane.\n\nAs they stood beside it, looking up at the gigantic wall of metal that\nrose sheer beside them hundreds of feet straight up, it seemed\nimpossible that this mighty thing could fly, that it could be propelled\nthrough the air. In awed silence they gazed at its vast bulk.\n\nThen, like pygmies beside some mighty prehistoric monster, they made\ntheir way along its side, seeking a door. Suddenly Wade stopped short\nand exclaimed: \"Arcot, this is senseless--we can't do this! The machine\nis so big that it'll take us half an hour of steady walking to go around\nit. We'll have to use the _Solarite_ to find an entrance!\"\n\nIt was well that they followed Wade's plan, for the only entrance, as\nthey later learned, was from the top. There, on the back of the giant,\nthe _Solarite_ landed--its great weight having no slightest effect on\nthe Kaxorian craft. They found a trap-door leading down inside. However,\nthe apparatus for opening it was evidently within the hull, so they had\nto burn a hole in the door before they could enter.\n\nWhat a sight there was for these men of Earth. The low rumble of the\nidling engines was barely audible as they descended the long ladder.\n\nThere was no resemblance whatever to the interior of a flying machine;\nrather, it suggested some great power house, where the energies of half\na nation were generated. They entered directly into a vast hall that\nextended for a quarter of a mile back through the great hull, and\ncompletely across the fuselage. To the extreme nose it ran, and\nthroughout there were scattered little globes that gave off an intense\nwhite light, illuminating all of the interior. Translucent bull's-eyes\nobscured the few windows.\n\nAll about, among the machines, lay Venerians. Dead they seemed, the\nillusion intensified by their strangely blue complexions. The two\nTerrestrians knew, however, that they could readily be restored to life.\nThe great machines they had been operating were humming softly, almost\ninaudibly. There were two long rows of them, extending to the end of\nthe great hall. They suggested mighty generators twenty feet high. From\ntheir tops projected two-feet-thick cylinders of solid fused quartz.\nFrom these extended other rods of fused quartz, rods that led down\nthrough the floor; but these were less bulky, scarcely over eight inches\nthick.\n\nThe huge generator-like machines were disc-shaped. From these, too, a\nquartz rod ran down through the floor. The machines on the further row\nwere in some way different; those in the front half of the row had the\ntubes leading to the floor below, but had no tubes jutting into the\nceiling. Instead, there were many slender rods connected with a vast\nswitchboard that covered all of one side of the great room. But\neverywhere were the great quartz rods, suggesting some complicated water\nsystem. Most of them were painted black, though the main rods leading\nfrom the roof above were as clear as crystal.\n\nArcot and Wade looked at these gigantic machines in hushed awe. They\nseemed impossibly huge; it was inconceivable that all this was but the\npower room of an airplane!\n\nWithout speaking, they descended to the level below, using a quite\nearthly appearing escalator. Despite the motionless figures everywhere,\nthey felt no fear of their encountering resistance. They knew the\neffectiveness of Wade's anesthetic.\n\nThe hall they entered was evidently the main room of the plane. It was\nas long as the one above, and higher, yet all that vast space was taken\nby one single, titanic coil that stretched from wall to wall! Into it,\nand from it there led two gigantic columns of fused quartz. That these\nwere rods, such as those smaller ones above was obvious, but each was\nover eight feet thick!\n\nShort they were, for they led from one mighty generator such as they had\nseen above, but magnified on a scale inconceivable! At the end of it,\nits driving power, its motor, was a great cylindrical case, into which\nled a single quartz bar ten inches thick. This bar was alive with\npulsing, glowing fires, that changed and maneuvered and died out over\nall its surface and through all its volume. The motor was but five feet\nin diameter and a scant seven feet long, yet obviously it was driving\nthe great machine, for there came from it a constant low hum, a deep\npitched song of awful power. And the huge quartz rod that led from the\ntitanic coil-cylinder was alive with the same glowing fires that played\nthrough the motor rod. From one side of the generator, ran two objects\nthat were familiar, copper bus bars. But even these were _three feet\nthick_!\n\nThe scores of quartz tubes that come down from the floor above joined,\ncoalesced, and ran down to the great generator, and into it.\n\nThey descended to another level. Here were other quartz tubes, but these\nled down still further, for this floor contained individual sleeping\nbunks, most of them unoccupied, unready for occupancy, though some were\nmade up.\n\nDown another level; again the bunks, the little individual rooms.\n\nAt last they reached the bottom level, and here the great quartz tubes\nterminated in a hundred smaller ones, each of these leading into some\nstrange mechanism. There were sighting devices on it, and there were\nports that opened in the floor. This was evidently the bombing room.\n\nWith an occasional hushed word, the Terrestrians walked through what\nseemed to be a vast city of the dead, passing sleeping officers, and\ncrewmen by the hundreds. On the third level they came at last to the\ncontrol room. Here were switchboards, control panels, and dozens of\nofficers, sleeping now, beside their instruments. A sudden dull thudding\nsound spun Arcot and Wade around, nerves taut. They relaxed and\nexchanged apologetic smiles. An automatic relay had adjusted some\nmechanism.\n\nThey noted one man stationed apart from the rest. He sat at the very\nbow, protected behind eight-inch coronium plates in which were set\nmasses of fused quartz that were nearly as strong as the metal itself.\nThese gave him a view in every direction except directly behind him.\nObviously, here was the pilot.\n\nReturning to the top level, they entered the long passages that led out\ninto the titanic wings. Here, as elsewhere, the ship was brightly\nlighted. They came to a small room, another bunk room. There were great\nnumbers of these down both sides of the long corridor, and along the two\nparallel corridors down the wing. In the fourth corridor near the back\nedge of the wing, there were bunk rooms on one side, and on the other\nwere bombing posts.\n\nAs they continued walking down the first corridor, they came to a small\nroom, whence issued the low hum of one of the motors. Entering, they\nfound the crew sleeping, and the motor idling.\n\n\"Good Lord!\" Wade exclaimed. \"Look at that motor, Arcot! No bigger than\nthe trunk of a man's body. Yet a battery of these sends the ship along\nat a mile a second! What power!\"\n\nSlowly they proceeded down the long hall. At each of the fifty engine\nmountings they found the same conditions. At the end of the hall there\nwas an escalator that led one level higher, into the upper wing. Here\nthey found long rows of the bombing posts and the corresponding quartz\nrods.\n\nThey returned finally to the control room. Here Arcot spent a long time\nlooking over the many instruments, the controls, and the piloting\napparatus.\n\n\"Wade,\" he said at last, \"I think I can see how this is done. I am going\nto stop those engines, start them, then accelerate them till the ship\nrolls a bit!\" Arcot stepped quickly over to the pilots seat, lifted the\nsleeping pilot out, and settled in his place.\n\n\"Now, you go over to that board there--that one--and when I ask you to,\nplease turn on that control--no, the one below--yes--turn it on about\none notch at a time.\"\n\nWade shook his head dubiously, a one-sided grin on his face. \"All right,\nArcot--just as you say--but when I think of the powers you're playing\nwith--well, a mistake might be unhealthy!\"\n\n\"I'm going to stop the motors now,\" Arcot announced quietly. All the\ntime they had been on board, they had been aware of the barely inaudible\nwhine of the motors. Now suddenly, it was gone, and the plane was still\nas death!\n\nArcot's voice sounded unnaturally loud. \"I did it without blowing the\nship up after all! Now we're going to try turning the power on!\"\n\nSuddenly there was a throaty hum; then quickly it became the low whine;\nthen, as Arcot turned on the throttle before him, he heard the tens of\nthousands of horsepower spring into life--and suddenly the whine was a\nlow roar--the mighty propellers out there had became a blur--then with\nmajestic slowness the huge machine moved off across the field!\n\nArcot shut off the motors and rose with a broad, relieved smile, \"Easy!\"\nhe said. They made their way again up through the ship, up through the\nroom of the tremendous cylinder coil, and then into the power room. Now\nthe machines were quiet, for the motors were no longer working.\n\n\"Arcot, you didn't shut off the biggest machine of all down there. How\ncome?\"\n\n\"I couldn't, Wade. It has no shut-off control, and if it did have, I\nwouldn't use it. I will tell you why when we get back to the\n_Solarite_.\"\n\nAt last they left the mighty machine; walked once more across its broad\nmetal top. Here and there they now saw the ends of those quartz\ncylinders. Once more they entered the _Solarite_, through the air lock,\nand took off the cumbersome insulating suits.\n\nAs quickly as possible Arcot outlined to the two who had stayed with the\n_Solarite_, the things they had seen, and the layout of the great ship.\n\n\"I think I can understand the secret of all that power, and it's not so\ndifferent from the _Solarite_, at that. It, too, draws its power from\nthe sun, though in a different way, and it stores it within itself,\nwhich the _Solarite_ does not try to do.\n\n\"Light of course, is energy, and therefore, has mass. It exerts\npressure, the impact of its moving units of energy--photons. We have\nelectrons and protons of matter, and photons of light. Now we know that\nthe mass of protons and electrons will attract other protons and\nelectrons, and hold them near--as in a stone, or in a solar system. The\nnew idea here is that the photons will attract each other ever more and\nmore powerfully, the closer they get. The Kaxorians have developed a\nmethod of getting them so close together, that they will, for a while at\nleast, hold themselves there, and with a little 'pressure', will stay\nthere indefinitely.\n\n\"In that huge coil and cylinder we found there we saw the main power\nstorage tank. That was full of gaseous light-energy held together by its\nown attraction, plus a little help of the generator!\"\n\n\"A little help?\" Wade exclaimed. \"Quite a little! I'll bet that thing\nhad a million horsepower in its motor!\"\n\n\"Yes--but I'll bet they have nearly fifty pounds of light condensed\nthere--so why worry about a little thing like a million horsepower? They\nhave plenty more where that comes from.\n\n\"I think they go up above the clouds in some way and collect the sun's\nenergy. Remember that Venus gets twice as much as Earth. They focus it\non those tubes on the roof there, and they, like all quartz tubes,\nconduct the light down into the condensers where it is first collected.\nThen it is led to the big condenser downstairs, where the final power is\nadded, and the condensed light is stored.\n\n\"Quartz conducts light just as copper conducts electricity--those are\nbus bars we saw running around there.\n\n\"The bombs we've been meeting recently are, of course, little knots of\nthis light energy thrown out by that projector mechanism we saw. When\nthey hit anything, the object absorbs their energy--and is very promptly\nvolatilized by the heat of the absorption.\n\n\"Do you remember that column of hissing radiance we saw shooting out of\nthe wrecked plane just before it blew up? That was the motor connection,\nbroken, and discharging free energy. That would ordinarily have\nsupplied all fifty motors at about full speed. Naturally, when it cut\nloose, it was rather violent.\n\n\"The main generator had been damaged, no doubt, so it stopped working,\nand the gravitational attraction of the photons wasn't enough, without\nits influence to hold them bound too long. All those floods of energy\nwere released instantaneously, of course.\n\n\"Look--there come the Lanorians now. I want to go back to Sonor and\nthink over this problem. Perhaps we can find something that will release\nall that energy--though honestly, I doubt it.\"\n\nArcot seemed depressed, overawed perhaps, by the sheer magnitude of the\nforce that lay bound up in the Kaxorian ship. It seemed inconceivable\nthat the little _Solarite_ could in any way be effective against the\nincredible machine.\n\nThe Lanorian planes were landing almost like a flock of birds, on the\nwings, the fuselage, the ground all about the gigantic ship. Arcot\ndropped into a chair, gazing moodily into emptiness, his thoughts on the\nmighty giant, stricken now, but only sleeping. In its vast hulk lay such\nenergies as intelligence had never before controlled; within it he knew\nthere were locked the powers of the sun itself. What could the\n_Solarite_ do against it?\n\n\"Oh, I almost forgot to mention it.\" Arcot spoke slowly, dejectedly. \"In\nthe heat of the attack back there it went practically unnoticed. Our\nonly weapon beside the gas is useless now. Do you remember how the ship\nseemed to lose its invisibility for an instant? I learned why when we\ninvestigated the ship. Those men are physicists of the highest order. We\nmust realize the terrible forces, both physical and mental that we are\nto meet. They've solved the secret of our invisibility, and now they can\nneutralize it. They began using it a bit too late this time, but they\nhad located the radio-produced interference caused by the ship's\ninvisibility apparatus, and they were sending a beam of interfering\nradio energy at us. We are invisible only by reason of the vibration of\nthe molecules in response to the radio impressed oscillations. The\nmolecules vibrate in tune, at terrific frequency, and the light can pass\nperfectly. What will happen, however, if someone locates the source of\nthe radio waves? It'll be simple for them to send out a radio beam and\ntouch our invisible ship with it. The two radio waves impressed on us\nnow will be out of step and the interference will instantly make us\nvisible. We can no longer attack them with our atomic hydrogen blast, or\nwith the gas--both are useless unless we can get close to them, and we\ncan't come within ten miles of them now. Those bombs of theirs are\neffective at that distance.\"\n\nAgain he fell silent, thinking--hoping for an idea that would once more\ngive them a chance to combat the Kaxorians. His three companions,\nequally depressed and without a workable idea, remained silent. Abruptly\nArcot stood up.\n\n\"I'm going to speak with the Commander-in-Field here. Then we can start\nback for Sonor--and maybe we had better head for home. It looks as\nthough there is little we can do here.\"\n\nBriefly he spoke to the young Venerian officer, and told him what he had\nlearned about the ship. Perhaps they could fly it to Sonor; or it could\nbe left there undestroyed if he would open a certain control just before\nhe left. Arcot showed him which one--it would drain out the power of the\ngreat storage tank, throwing it harmlessly against the clouds above. The\nKaxorians might destroy the machine if they wanted to--Arcot felt that\nthey would not wish to. They would hope, with reason, they might\nrecapture it! It would be impossible to move that tremendous machine\nwithout the power that its \"tank\" was intended to hold.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nSlowly they cruised back to Sonor, Arcot still engrossed in thought.\nWould it be that Venus would fall before the attack of the mighty\nplanes, that they would sweep out across space, to Earth--to Mars--to\nother worlds, a cosmic menace? Would the mighty machines soon be\ncircling Earth? Guided missiles with atomic warheads could combat them,\nperhaps, as could the molecular motion machines. Perhaps these could be\narmored with twenty-inch steel walls, and driven into the great\npropellers, or at miles a second, into the ship itself! But these ships\nwould require long hours, days, even weeks to build, and in that time\nthe Kaxorian fleet would be ready. It would attack Earth within six days\nnow! What hope was there to avert incalculable destruction--if not\noutright defeat?\n\nIn despair Arcot turned and strode quickly down the long hallway of the\n_Solarite_. Above him he could hear the smooth, even hum of the sweetly\nfunctioning generator, but it only reminded him of the vastly greater\nenergies he had seen controlled that night. The thudding relays in the\npower room, as Wade maneuvered the ship, seemed some diminutive mockery\nof the giant relays he had seen in the power room of the Kaxorian plane.\n\nHe sat down in the power room, looking at the stacked apparatus, neatly\narranged, as it must be, to get all this apparatus in this small space.\nThen at last he began to think more calmly. He concentrated on the\ngreatest forces known to man--and there were only two that even occurred\nto him as great! One was the vast energies he had that very night\nlearned of; the other was the force of the molecules, the force that\ndrove his ship.\n\nHe had had no time to work out the mathematics of the light compression,\nmathematics that he now knew would give results. There remained only the\nmolecular motion. What could he do with it that he had not done?\n\nHe drew out a small black notebook. In it were symbols, formulas, and\npage after page of the intricate calculus that had ended finally in the\nharnessing of this great force that was even now carrying him smoothly\nalong.\n\nHalf an hour later he was still busy--covering page after page with\nswiftly written formulas. Before him was a great table of multiple\nintegers, the only one like it known to exist in the System, for the\nmultiple calculus was an invention of Arcot's. At last he found the\nexpression he wanted, and carefully he checked his work, excitedly\nthough now, with an expression of eager hope--it seemed logical--it\nseemed correct--\n\n\"Morey--oh, Morey,\" he called, holding his enthusiasm in check, \"if you\ncan come here--I want you to check some math for me. I've done it--and I\nwant to see if you get the same result independently!\" Morey was a more\ncareful mathematician than he, and it was to him Arcot turned for\nverification of any new discovery.\n\nFollowing the general directions Arcot gave him, Morey went through the\nlong series of calculations--and arrived at the same results. Slowly he\nlooked up from the brief expression with which he had ended.\n\nIt was not the formula that astonished him--it was its physical\nsignificance.\n\n\"Arcot--do you think we can make it?\"\n\nThere was a new expression in Arcot's eyes, a tightness about his mouth.\n\n\"I hope so, Morey. If we don't, Lanor is lost beyond a doubt--and\nprobably Earth is, too. Wade--come here a minute, will you? Let Fuller\ntake the controls, and tell him to push it. We have to get to work on\nthis.\"\n\nRapidly Arcot explained their calculations--and the proof he had gotten.\n\n\"Our beam of molecular motion-controlling energy directs all molecular\nmotion to go at right angles to it. The mechanism so far has been a\nfield inside a coil really, but if these figures are right, it means\nthat we can project that field to a considerable distance even in air.\nIt'll be a beam of power that will cause all molecules in its path to\nmove at right angles to it, and in the direction we choose, by reversing\nthe power in the projector. That means that no matter how big the thing\nis, we can tear it to pieces; we'll use its own powers, its own\nenergies, to rip it, or crush it.\n\n\"Imagine what would happen if we directed this against the side of a\nmountain--the entire mass of rock would at once fly off at unimaginable\nspeed, crashing ahead with terrific power, as all the molecules suddenly\nmoved in the same direction. Nothing in all the Universe could hold\ntogether against it! It's a disintegration ray of a sort--a ray that\nwill tear, or crush, for we can either make one half move away from the\nother--or we can reverse the power, and make one half drive toward the\nother with all the terrific power of its molecules! It is\nomnipotent--hmmm--\" Arcot paused, narrowing his eyes in thought.\n\n\"It has one limitation. Will it reach far in the air? In vacuum it\nshould have an infinite range--in the atmosphere all the molecules of\nthe air will be affected, and it will cause a terrific blast of icy\nwind, a gale at temperatures far below zero! This will be even more\neffective here on Venus!\n\n\"But we must start designing the thing at once! Take some of the\nImmorpho and give me some, and we can let the sleep accumulate till we\nhave more time! Look--we're in Sonor already! Land us, Fuller--right\nwhere we were, and then come back here. We're going to need you!\"\n\nThe gorgeous display of a Venerian dawn was already coloring the east as\nthe great buildings seemed to rise silently about them. The sky, which\nhad been a dull luminous gray, a gray that rapidly grew brighter and\nbrighter, was now like molten silver, through which were filtering the\nearly rays of the intense sun. As the sun rose above the horizon, though\ninvisible for clouds, it still was traceable by the wondrous shell pink\nthat began to suffuse the ten mile layer of vapor. The tiny droplets\nwere, however, breaking the clear light into a million rainbows, and all\nabout the swiftly deepening pink were forming concentric circles of\nblue, of green, orange, and all the colors of the rainbow, repeated time\nafter time--a wondrous halo of glowing color, which only the doubly\nintense sun could create.\n\n\"It's almost worth missing the sun all day to see their sunrises and\nsunsets,\" Fuller commented. The men were watching it, despite their\nneed for haste. It was a sight the like of which no Earthman had ever\nbefore seen.\n\nImmediately, then, they plunged into the extremely complex calculation\nof the electrical apparatus to produce the necessary fields. To get the\neffect they wanted, they must have two separate fields of the director\nray, and a third field of a slightly different nature, which would cause\nthe director ray to move in one direction only. It would be\ndisconcerting, to say the least, if the director ray, by some mistake,\nshould turn upon them!\n\nThe work went on more swiftly than they had considered possible, but\nthere was still much to be done on the theoretical end of the job alone\nwhen the streets about them began to fill. They noticed that a large\ncrowd was assembling, and shortly after they had finished, after some of\nthese people had stood there for more than an hour and a half, the crowd\nhad grown to great size.\n\n\"From the looks of that collection, I should say we are about to become\nthe principals in some kind of a celebration that we know nothing about.\nWell, we're here, and in case they want us, we're ready to come.\"\n\nThe guard that always surrounded the _Solarite_ had been doubled, and\nwas maintaining a fairly large clear area about the ship.\n\nShortly thereafter they saw one of the high officials of Lanor come down\nthe walk from the governmental building, walking toward the _Solarite_.\n\n\"Time for us to appear--and it may as well be all of us this time. I'll\ntell you what they say afterward, Wade. They've evidently gone to\nconsiderable trouble to get up this meeting, so let's cooperate. I hate\nto slow up the work, but we'll try to make it short.\"\n\nThe four Terrestrians got into their cooling suits, and stepped outside\nthe ship. The Lanorian dignitary left his guard, walked up to the\nquartet from Earth with measured tread, and halted before them.\n\n\"Earthmen,\" he began in a deep, clear voice, \"we have gathered here this\nmorning to greet you and thank you for the tremendous service you have\ndone us. Across the awful void of empty space you have journeyed forty\nmillion miles to visit us, only to discover that Venerians were making\nready to attack your world. Twice your intervention has saved our city.\n\n\"There is, of course, no adequate reward for this service; we can in no\nway repay you, but in a measure we may show our appreciation. We have\nlearned from the greatest psychologist of our nation, Tonlos, that in\nyour world aluminum is plentiful, but gold and platinum are rare, and\nthat morlus is unknown. I have had a small token made for you, and your\nfriends. It is a little plaque, a disc of morlus, and on it there is a\nsmall map of the Solar System. On the reverse side there is a globe of\nVenus, with one of Earth beside it, as well as our men could copy the\nsmall globe you have given us. The northern hemisphere of each is\ndepicted--America, your nation, and Lanor, ours, thus being shown. We\nwant you, and each of your friends, to accept these. They are symbols of\nyour wonderful flight across space!\" The Venerians turned to each of the\nTerrestrians and presented each with a small metal disc.\n\nArcot spoke for the Terrestrians.\n\n\"On behalf of myself and my friends here, two of whom have not had an\nopportunity to learn your language, I wish to thank you for your great\nhelp when we most needed it. You, perhaps, have saved more than a\ncity--you may have made it possible to save a world--our Earth. But the\nbattle here has only begun.\n\n\"There are now in the Kaxorian camp eighteen great ships. They have been\nbadly defeated in the three encounters they have had with the _Solarite_\nso far. But no longer will they be vulnerable to our earlier methods of\nattack. Your spies report that the first plane, the plane which was\nfirst attacked by the _Solarite_, is still undergoing repairs. These\nwill be completed within two days, and then, when they can leave a base\nguard of two ships, they will attack once more. Furthermore, they will\nattack with a new weapon. They have destroyed the usefulness of our\nweapon, invisibility, and in turn, now have it to use against us! We\nmust seek out some new weapon. I hope we are on the right track now, but\nevery moment is precious, and we must get back to the work. This address\nmust be short. Later, when we have completed our preliminary work, we\nwill have to give plans to your workmen, which you will be able to turn\ninto metal, for we lack the materials. With this help we may succeed,\ndespite our handicap.\"\n\nThe address was terminated at once. The Lanorians were probably\ndisappointed, but they fully realized the necessity for haste.\n\n\"I wish Terrestrian orators spoke like that,\" remarked Morey as they\nreturned to the ship. \"He said all there was to say, but he didn't run\nmiles of speech doing it. He was a very forceful speaker, too!\"\n\n\"People who speak briefly and to the point generally are,\" Arcot said.\n\nIt was nearly noon that day before the theoretical discussion had been\nreduced to practical terms. They were ready to start work at once, but\nthey had reason to work cheerfully now. Even through air they had found\ntheir ray would be able to reach thirty-five miles! They would be well\nout of the danger zone while attacking the gigantic planes of Kaxor.\n\nMorey, Wade and Arcot at once set to work constructing the electrical\nplant that was to give them the necessary power. It was lucky indeed\nthat they had brought the great mass of spare apparatus! They had more\nthan enough to make all the electrical machinery. The tubes, the coils,\nthe condensers, all were there. The generator would easily supply the\npower, for the terrific forces that were to destroy the Kaxorian ships\nwere to be generated in the plane itself. It was to destroy itself; the\n_Solarite_ would merely be the detonator to set it off!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhile the physicists were busy on this, Fuller was designing the\nmechanical details of the projector. It must be able to turn through a\nspherical angle of 180 degrees, and was necessarily controlled\nelectrically from the inside. The details of the projector were worked\nout by six that evening, and the numerous castings and machined pieces\nthat were to be used were to be made in the Venerian machine shops.\n\nOne difficulty after another arose and was overcome. Night came on, and\nstill they continued work. The Venerian workmen had promised to have the\napparatus for them by ten o'clock the next morning--or what corresponded\nto ten o'clock.\n\nShortly after three o'clock that morning they had finished the\napparatus, had connected all the controls, and had placed the last of\nthe projector directors. Except for the projector they were ready, and\nMorey, Wade and Fuller turned in to get what sleep they could. But\nArcot, telling them there was something he wished to get, took another\ndose of Immorpho and stepped out into the steaming rain.\n\nA few minutes after ten the next morning Arcot came back, followed by\nhalf a dozen Venerians, each carrying a large metal cylinder in a\ncradle. These were attached to the landing gear of the _Solarite_ in\nsuch fashion that the fusing of one piece of wire would permit the\nentire thing to drop free.\n\n\"So _that's_ what you hatched out, eh? What is it?\" asked Wade as he\nentered the ship.\n\n\"Just a thing I want to try out--and I'm going to keep it a deep, dark\nsecret for a while. I think you'll get quite a surprise when you see\nthose bombs in action! They're arranged to be released by turning\ncurrent into the landing lights. We'll have to forgo lights for the\npresent, but I needed the bombs more.\n\n\"The mechanics have finished working on your projector parts, Fuller,\nand they'll be over here in a short time. Here comes the little gang I\nasked to help us. You can direct them.\" Arcot paused and scowled with\nannoyance. \"Hang it all--when they drill into the outer wall, we'll lose\nthe vacuum between the two walls, and all that hot air will come in.\nThis place will be roasting in a short time. We have the molecular\nmotion coolers, but I'm afraid they won't be much good. Can't use the\ngenerator--it's cut off from the main room by vacuum wall.\n\n\"I think we'd better charge up the gas tanks and the batteries as soon\nas this is done. Then tonight we'll attack the Kaxorian construction\ncamp. I've just learned that no spy reports have been coming in, and I'm\nafraid they'll spring a surprise.\"\n\nSomewhat later came the sound of drills, then the whistling roar as the\nair sucked into the vacuum, told the men inside that the work was under\nway. It soon became uncomfortably hot as, the vacuum destroyed, the heat\ncame in through all sides. It was more than the little molecular coolers\ncould handle, and the temperature soon rose to about a hundred and\nfifteen. It was not as bad as the Venerian atmosphere, for the air\nseemed exceedingly dry, and the men found it possible to get along\nwithout cooling suits, if they did not work. Since there was little they\ncould do, they simply relaxed.\n\nIt was nearly dark before the Lanorians had finished their work, and the\ngas tanks had been recharged. All that time Arcot had spent with Tonlos\ndetermining the position of the Kaxorian construction camp. Spy reports\nand old maps had helped, but it was impossible to do very accurate work\nby these means.\n\nIt was finally decided that the Kaxorian construction camp was about\n10,500 miles to the southwest. The _Solarite_ was to start an hour after\ndark. Travelling westward at their speed, they hoped to reach the camp\njust after nightfall.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\nThe _Solarite_ sped swiftly toward the southwest. The sky slowly grew\nlighter as the miles flashed beneath them. They were catching up with\nthe sun. As they saw the rolling ocean beneath them give way to low\nplains, they realized they were over Kaxorian land. The _Solarite_ was\nflying very high, and as they showed no lights, and were not using the\ninvisibility apparatus, they were practically undetectable. Suddenly\nthey saw the lights of a mighty city looming far off to the east.\n\n\"It's Kanor. Pass well to the west of it. That's their capital. We're on\ncourse.\" Arcot spoke from his position at the projector, telling Wade\nthe directions to follow on his course to the berth of the giant planes.\n\nThe city dropped far behind them in moments, followed by another, and\nanother. At length, veering southward into the dusk, they entered a\nregion of low hills, age-old folds in the crust of the planet, rounded\nby untold millennia of torrential rains.\n\n\"Easy, Wade. We are near now.\" Mile after mile they flashed ahead at\nabout a thousand miles an hour--then suddenly they saw far off to the\neast a vast glow that reached into the sky, painting itself on the\neternal clouds miles above.\n\n\"There it is, Wade. Go high, and take it easy!\"\n\nSwiftly the _Solarite_ climbed, hovering at last on the very rim of the\ncloud blanket, an invisible mote in a sea of gray mist. Below them they\nsaw a tremendous field carved, it seemed, out of the ancient hills. From\nthis height all sense of proportion was lost. It seemed but an ordinary\nfield, with eighteen ordinary airplanes resting on it. One of these now\nwas moving, and in a moment it rose into the air! But there seemed to be\nno men on all the great field. They were invisibly small from this\nheight.\n\nAbruptly Arcot gave a great shout. \"That's their surprise! They're ready\nfar ahead of the time we expected! If all that armada gets in the air,\nwe're done! Down, Wade, to within a few hundred feet of the ground, and\nclose to the field!\"\n\nThe _Solarite_ flashed down in a power dive--down with a sickening\nlurch. A sudden tremendous weight seemed to crush them as the ship was\nbrought out of the dive not more than two hundred feet from the ground.\nClose to blacking out, Wade nevertheless shot it in as close to the\nfield as he dared. Anxiously he called to Arcot, who answered with a\nbrief \"Okay!\" The planes loomed gigantic now, their true proportions\nshowing clearly against the brilliant light of the field. A tremendous\nwave of sound burst from the loudspeaker as the planes rolled across the\nground to leap gracefully into the air--half a million tons of metal!\n\nFrom the _Solarite_ there darted a pale beam of ghostly light, faintly\ngray, tinged with red and green--the ionized air of the beam. It moved\nin a swift half circle. In an instant the whirr of the hundreds,\nthousands of giant propellers was drowned in a terrific roar of air.\nGreat snowflakes fell from the air before them; it was white with the\nsolidified water vapor. Then came a titanic roar and the planet itself\nseemed to shake! A crash, a snapping and rending as a mighty fountain of\nsoil and rock cascaded skyward, and with it, twisting, turning, hurled\nin a dozen directions at once, twelve titanic ships reeled drunkenly\ninto the air!\n\nFor a barely perceptible interval there was an oppressive silence as the\nray was shut off. Then a bedlam of deafening sound burst forth anew, a\nmighty deluge of unbearable noise as the millions of tons of pulverized\nrock, humus and metal fell back. Some of it had ascended for miles; it\nsettled amid a howling blizzard--snow that melted as it touched the\nmadly churned airfield.\n\nHigh above there were ten planes flying about uncertainly. Suddenly one\nof these turned, heading for the ground far below, its wings screaming\ntheir protest as the motors roared, ever faster, with the gravity of the\nplanet aiding them. There was a rending, crackling crash as the wings\nsuddenly bent back along the sides. An instant later the fuselage tore\nfree, rocketing downward; the wings followed more slowly--twisting,\nturning, dipping in mile-long swoops.\n\nThe _Solarite_ shot away from the spot at maximum speed--away and up,\nwith a force that nailed the occupants to the floor. Before they could\nturn, behind them flared a mighty gout of light that struck to the very\nclouds above, and all the landscape, for miles about, was visible in the\nglare of the released energy.\n\nAs they turned, they saw on the plain, below a tremendous crater, in\nits center a spot that glowed white and bubbled like the top of a huge\ncauldron.\n\nNine great planes were circling in the air; then in an instant they were\ngone, invisible. As swiftly the _Solarite_ darted away with a speed that\ndefied the aim of any machine.\n\nHigh above the planes they went, for with his radar Arcot could trace\nthem. They were circling, searching for the _Solarite_.\n\nThe tiny machine was invisible in the darkness, but its invisibility was\nnot revealed by the Kaxorian's radio detectors. In the momentary lull,\nFuller asked a question.\n\n\"Wade, how is it that those ships can be invisible when they are driven\nby light, and have the light stored in them? They're perfectly\ntransparent. Why can't we see the light?\"\n\n\"They are storing the light. It's bound--it can't escape. You can't see\nlight unless it literally hits you in the eye. Their stored light can't\nreach you, for it is held by its own attraction and by the special field\nof the big generators.\"\n\nThey seemed to be above one of the Kaxorian planes now. Arcot caught the\nroar of the invisible propellers.\n\n\"To the left, Wade--faster--hold it--left--ah!\" Arcot pushed a button.\n\nDown from the _Solarite_ there dropped a little canister, one of the\nbombs that Arcot had prepared the night before. To hit an invisible\ntarget is ordinarily difficult, but when that target is far larger than\nthe proverbial side of a barn, it is not very difficult, at that. But\nnow Arcot's companions watched for the crash of the explosion, the flash\nof light. What sort of bomb was it that Arcot hoped would penetrate that\ntremendous armor?\n\nSuddenly they saw a great spot of light, a spot that spread with\nstartling rapidity, a patch of light that ran, and moved. It flew\nthrough the air at terrific speed. It was a pallid light, green and wan\nand ghostly, that seemed to flow and ebb.\n\nFor an instant Morey and the others stared in utter surprise. Then\nsuddenly Morey burst out laughing.\n\n\"Ho--you win, Arcot. That was one they didn't think of, I'll bet!\nLuminous paint--and by the hundred gallon! Radium paint, I suppose, and\nno man has ever found how to stop the glow of radium. That plane sticks\nout like a sore thumb!\"\n\nIndeed, the great luminous splotch made the gigantic plane clearly\nevident against the gray clouds. Visible or not, that plane was marked.\n\nQuickly Arcot tried to maneuver the _Solarite_ over another of the great\nships, for now the danger was only from those he could not see. Suddenly\nhe had an idea.\n\n\"Morey--go back to the power room and change the adjustment on the\nmeteorite avoider to half a mile!\" At once Morey understood his plan,\nand hastened to put it into effect.\n\nThe illuminated plane was diving, twisting wildly now. The _Solarite_\nflashed toward it with sickening speed, then suddenly the gigantic bulk\nof the plane loomed off to the right of the tiny ship, the great metal\nhull, visible now, rising in awesome might. They were too near; they\nshot away to a greater distance--then again that ghostly beam reached\nout--and for just a fraction of a second it touched the giant plane.\n\nThe titanic engine of destruction seemed suddenly to be in the grip of\nsome vastly greater Colossus--a clutching hand that closed! The plane\njumped back with an appalling crash, a roar of rending metal. For an\ninstant there came the sound like a mighty buzz-saw as the giant\npropellers of one wing cut into the body of the careening plane. In that\ninstant, the great power storage tank split open with an impact like the\nbursting of a world. The _Solarite_ was hurled back by an explosion that\nseemed to rend the very atoms of the air, and all about them was a\ntorrid blaze of heat and light that seemed to sear their faces and hands\nwith its intensity.\n\nThen in a time so brief that it seemed never to have happened, it was\ngone, and only the distant drone of the other ships' propellers came to\nthem. There was no luminous spot. The radium paint had been destroyed\nin the only possible way--it was volatilized through all the atmosphere!\n\nThe Terrestrians had known what to expect; had known what would happen;\nand they had not looked at the great ship in that last instant. But the\nKaxorians had naturally been looking at it. They had never seen the sun\ndirectly, and now they had been looking at a radiance almost as\nbrilliant. They were temporarily blinded; they could only fly a straight\ncourse in response to the quick order of their squadron commander.\n\nAnd in that brief moment that they were unable to watch him, Arcot\ndropped two more bombs in quick succession. Two bright spots formed in\nthe black night. No longer did these planes feel themselves\ninvulnerable, able to meet any foe! In an instant they had put on every\nlast trace of power, and at their top speed they were racing west, away\nfrom their tiny opponent--in the only direction that was open to them.\n\nBut it was useless. The _Solarite_ could pick up speed in half the time\nthey could, and in an instant Arcot again trained his beam on the mighty\nsplotch of light that was a fleeing plane.\n\nOut of the darkness came a ghostly beam, for an instant of time so short\nthat before the explosive shells of the other could be trained on it,\nthe _Solarite_ had moved. Under that touch the mighty plane began\ncrumbling, then it splintered beneath the driving blow of the great\nwing, as it shot toward the main body of the plane at several miles a\nsecond--driving into and through it! The giant plane twisted and turned\nas it fell swiftly downward into the darkness--and, again there came\nthat world-rocking explosion, and the mighty column of light.\n\nAgain and yet again the _Solarite_ found and destroyed Kaxorian\nsuper-planes, protected in the uneven conflict by their diminutive size\nand the speed of their elusive maneuvering.\n\nBut to remind the men of the _Solarite_ that they were not alone, there\ncame a sudden report just behind them, and they turned to see that one\nof the energy bombs had barely fallen short! In an instant the\ncomparative midget shot up at top speed, out of danger. It looped and\nturned, hunting, feeling with its every detector for that other ship.\nThe great planes were spread out now. In every direction they could be\nlocated--and all were leaving the scene of the battle. But one by one\nthe _Solarite_ shot after them, and always the speed of the little ship\nwas greater.\n\nTwo escaped. They turned off their useless invisibility apparatus and\nvanished into the night.\n\nThe _Solarite_, supported by her vertical lift units, coasted toward a\nstop. The drone of the fleeing super-planes diminished and was gone, and\nfor a time the thrum of the generator and the tap-dance of relays\nadjusting circuits was the only sound aboard.\n\nWade sighed finally. \"Well, gentlemen, now we've got it, what do we do\nwith it?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Morey asked.\n\n\"Victory. The Jack-pot. Having the devices we just demonstrated, we are\nnow the sole owners, by right of conquest, of one highly disturbed\nnation of several million people. With that gadget there, we can pick it\nup and throw it away.\n\n\"Personally, I have a feeling that we've just won the largest white\nelephant in history. We don't just walk off and leave it, you know. We\ndon't want it. But we've got it.\n\n\"Our friends in Sonor are not going to want the problem either; they\njust wanted the Kaxorians combed out of their hair.\n\n\"As I say--we've got it, now--but what do we do with it?\"\n\n\"It's basically their problem, isn't it?\" protested Fuller. Morey looked\nsomewhat stricken, and thoroughly bewildered. \"I hadn't considered that\naspect very fully; I've been too darned busy trying to stay alive.\"\n\nWade shook his head. \"Look, Fuller-it was their problem before, too,\nwasn't it? How'd they handle it? If you just let them alone, what do\nyou suppose they'll do with the problem this time?\"\n\n\"The same thing they did before,\" Arcot groaned. \"I'm tired. Let's get\nsome sleep first, anyway.\"\n\n\"Sure; that makes good sense,\" Wade agreed. \"Sleep on it, yes. But go to\nsleep on it--well, that's what the not-so-bright Sonorans tried doing.\n\n\"And off-hand, I'd say we were elected. The Kaxorians undoubtedly have a\nnice, two thousand year old hatred for the Sonorans who so snobbishly\nignored them, isolated them, and considered them unfit for association.\nThe Sonorans, on the other hand, are now thoroughly scared, and will be\nfeeling correspondingly vindictive. They won this time by a fluke--our\ncoming. I can just see those two peoples getting together and settling\nany kind of sensible, long-term treaty of mutual cooperation!\"\n\nArcot and Morey both nodded wearily. \"That is so annoyingly correct,\"\nMorey agreed. \"And you know blasted well none of us is going to sleep\nuntil we have some line of attack on this white elephant disposal\nproblem. Anybody any ideas?\"\n\nFuller looked at the other three. \"You know, in design when two\nincompatible materials must be structurally united, we tie each to a\nthird material that is compatible with both.\n\n\"Sonor didn't win this fight. Kaxor didn't win it. Earth--in the\n_persona_ of the _Solarite_--did. Earth isn't mad at anybody, hasn't\nbeen damaged by anybody, and hasn't been knowingly ignoring anybody.\n\n\"The Sonorans want to be let alone; it won't work, but they can learn\nthat. I think if we run the United Nations in on this thing, we may be\nable to get them to accept our white elephant for us.\n\n\"They'll be making the same mistake Sonor did if they don't--knowingly\nignoring the existence of a highly intelligent and competent race. It\ndoesn't seem to work, judging from history both at home and here.\"\n\nThe four looked at each other, and found agreement.\n\n\"That's something more than a problem to sleep on,\" Morey said. \"I'll\nget in touch with Sonor and tell 'em the shooting is over, so they can\nget some sleep too.\n\n\"It's obvious a bunch of high-power research teams are going to be\nneeded in both countries. Earth has every reason to respect Sonoran\nmental sciences as well as Kaxorian light-engineering. And Earth--as we\njust thoroughly demonstrated--has some science of her own. Obviously,\nthe interaction of the three is to the maximum advantage of each--and\nwill lead to a healing of the breach that now exists.\"\n\nArcot looked up and yawned. \"I'm putting this on autopilot at twenty\nmiles up, and going to sleep. We can kick this around for a month\nanyway--and this is not the night to start.\"\n\n\"The decision is unanimous,\" Wade grinned.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK THREE\n\nTHE BLACK STAR PASSES\n\n\n\n\nPROLOGUE\n\n\nTaj Lamor gazed steadily down at the vast dim bulk of the ancient city\nspread out beneath him. In the feeble light of the stars its mighty\nmasses of up-flung metal buildings loomed strangely, like the shells of\nsome vast race of crustacea, long extinct. Slowly he turned, gazing now\nout across the great plaza, where rested long rows of slender, yet\nmighty ships. Thoughtfully he stared at their dim, half-seen shapes.\n\nTaj Lamor was not human. Though he was humanoid, Earth had never seen\ncreatures just like him. His seven foot high figure seemed a bit\nungainly by Terrestrial standards, and his strangely white, hairless\nflesh, suggesting unbaked dough, somehow gave the impression of\nnear-transparency. His eyes were disproportionately large, and the black\ndisc of pupil in the white corneas was intensified by contrast. Yet\nperhaps his race better deserved the designation _homo sapiens_ than\nTerrestrians do, for it was wise with the accumulated wisdom of\nuncounted eons.\n\nHe turned to the other man in the high, cylindrical, dimly lit tower\nroom overlooking the dark metropolis, a man far older than Taj Lamor,\nhis narrow shoulders bent, and his features grayed with his years. His\nsingle short, tight-fitting garment of black plastic marked him as one\nof the Elders. The voice of Taj Lamor was vibrant with feeling:\n\n\"Tordos Gar, at last we are ready to seek a new sun. Life for our race!\"\n\nA quiet, patient, imperturbable smile appeared on the Elder's face and\nthe heavy lids closed over his great eyes.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said sadly, \"but at what cost in tranquility! The discord, the\nunrest, the awakening of unnatural ambitions--a dreadful price to pay\nfor a questionable gain. Too great a price, I think.\" His eyes opened,\nand he raised a thin hand to check the younger man's protest. \"I know--I\nknow--in this we do not see as one. Yet perhaps some day you will learn\neven as I have that to rest is better than to engage in an endless\nstruggle. Suns and planets die. Why should races seek to escape the\ninevitable?\" Tordos Gar turned slowly away and gazed fixedly into the\nnight sky.\n\nTaj Lamor checked an impatient retort and sighed resignedly. It was this\nattitude that had made his task so difficult. Decadence. A race on an\nages-long decline from vast heights of philosophical and scientific\nlearning. Their last external enemy had been defeated millennia in the\npast; and through easy forgetfulness and lack of strife, ambition had\ndied. Adventure had become a meaningless word.\n\nStrangely, during the last century a few men had felt the stirrings of\nlong-buried emotion, of ambition, of a craving for adventure. These were\nthrowbacks to those ancestors of the race whose science had built their\nworld. These men, a comparative handful, had been drawn to each other by\nthe unnatural ferment within them; and Taj Lamor had become their\nleader. They had begun a mighty struggle against the inertia of ages of\nslow decay, had begun a search for the lost secrets of a\nhundred-million-year-old science.\n\nTaj Lamor raised his eyes to the horizon. Through the leaping curve of\nthe crystal clear roof of their world glowed a blazing spot of yellow\nfire. A star--the brightest object in a sky whose sun had lost its\nlight. A point of radiance that held the last hopes of an incredibly\nancient race.\n\nThe quiet voice of Tordos Gar came through the semidarkness of the\nroom, a pensive, dreamlike quality in its tones.\n\n\"You, Taj Lamor, and those young men who have joined you in this futile\nexpedition do not think deeply enough. Your vision is too narrow. You\nlack perspective. In your youth you cannot think on a cosmic scale.\" He\npaused as though in thought, and when he continued, it seemed almost as\nthough he were speaking to himself.\n\n\"In the far, dim past fifteen planets circled about a small, red sun.\nThey were dead worlds--or rather, worlds that had not yet lived. Perhaps\na million years passed before there moved about on three of them the\nbeginnings of life. Then a hundred million years passed, and those\nfirst, crawling protoplasmic masses had become animals, and plants, and\nintermediate growths. And they fought endlessly for survival. Then more\nmillions of years passed, and there appeared a creature which slowly\ngained ascendancy over the other struggling life forms that fought for\nthe warmth of rays of the hot, red sun.\n\n\"That sun had been old, even as the age of a star is counted, before its\nplanets had been born, and many, many millions of years had passed\nbefore those planets cooled, and then more eons sped by before life\nappeared. Now, as life slowly forced its way upward, that sun was nearly\nburned out. The animals fought, and bathed in the luxury of its rays,\nfor many millennia were required to produce any noticeable change in its\nlife-giving radiations.\n\n\"At last one animal gained the ascendancy. Our race. But though one\nspecies now ruled, there was no peace. Age followed age while\nsemi-barbaric peoples fought among themselves. But even as they fought,\nthey learned.\n\n\"They moved from caves into structures of wood and stone--and\nengineering had its beginning. With the buildings came little chemical\nengines to destroy them; warfare was developing. Then came the first\ncrude flying-machines, using clumsy, inefficient engines. Chemical\nengines! Engines so crude that one could watch the flow of their fuel!\nOne part in one hundred thousand million of the energy of their\npropellents they released to run the engines, and they carried fuel in\nsuch vast quantities that they staggered under its load as they left the\nground! And warfare became world-wide. After flight came other machines\nand other ages. Other scientists began to have visions of the realms\nbeyond, and they sought to tap the vast reservoirs of Nature's energies,\nthe energies of matter.\n\n\"Other ages saw it done--a few thousand years later there passed out\ninto space a machine that forced its way across the void to another\nplanet! And the races of the three living worlds became as one--but\nthere was no peace.\n\n\"Swiftly now, science grew upon itself, building with ever faster steps,\nlike a crystal which, once started, forms with incalculable speed.\n\n\"And while that science grew swiftly greater, other changes took place,\nchanges in our universe itself. Ten million years passed before the\nfirst of those changes became important. But slowly, steadily our\natmosphere was drifting into space. Through ages this gradually became\napparent. Our worlds were losing their air and their water. One planet,\nless favored than another, fought for its life, and space itself was\nablaze with the struggles of wars for survival.\n\n\"Again science helped us. Thousands of years before, men had learned how\nto change the mass of matter into energy, but now at last the process\nwas reversed, and those ancestors of ours could change energy into\nmatter, any kind of matter they wished. Rock they took, and changed it\nto energy, then that energy they transmuted to air, to water, to the\nnecessary metals. Their planets took a new lease of life!\n\n\"But even this could not continue forever. They must stop that loss of\nair. The process they had developed for reformation of matter admitted\nof a new use. Creation! They were now able to make new elements,\nelements that had never existed in nature! They designed atoms as, long\nbefore, their fathers had designed molecules. At last their problem was\nsolved. They made a new form of matter that was clearer than any\ncrystal, and yet stronger and tougher than any metal known. Since it\nheld out none of the sun's radiations, they could roof their worlds with\nit and keep their air within!\n\n\"This was a task that could not be done in a year, nor a decade, but all\ntime stretched out unending before them. One by one the three planets\nbecame tremendous, roofed-in cities. Only their vast powers, their\nmighty machines made the task possible, but it was done.\"\n\nThe droning voice of Tordos Gar ceased. Taj Lamor, who had listened with\na mixture of amusement and impatience to the recital of a history he\nknew as well as the aged, garrulous narrator, waited out of the inborn\nrespect which every man held for the Elders. At length he exclaimed: \"I\nsee no point--\"\n\n\"But you will when I finish--or, at least, I hope you will.\" Tordos\nGar's words and tone were gently reproving. He continued quietly:\n\n\"Slowly the ages drifted on, each marked by greater and greater triumphs\nof science. But again and again there were wars. Some there were in\nwhich the population of a world was halved, and all space for a billion\nmiles about was a vast cauldron of incandescent energy in which\ntremendous fleets of space ships swirled and fused like ingredients in\nsome cosmic brew. Forces were loosed on the three planets that sent even\ntheir mighty masses reeling drunkenly out of their orbits, and space\nitself seemed to be torn by the awful play of energies.\n\n\"Always peace followed--a futile peace. A few brief centuries or a few\nmillennia, and again war would flame. It would end, and life would\ncontinue.\n\n\"But slowly there crept into the struggle a new factor, a darkening\ncloud, a change that came so gradually that only the records of\ninstruments, made during a period of thousands of years, could show it.\nOur sun had changed from bright red to a deep, sullen crimson, and ever\nless and less heat poured from it. It was waning!\n\n\"As the fires of life died down, the people of the three worlds joined\nin a conflict with the common menace, death from the creeping cold of\nspace. There was no need for great haste; a sun dies slowly. Our\nancestors laid their plans and carried them out. The fifteen worlds were\nencased in shells of crystal. Those that had no atmosphere were given\none. Mighty heating plants were built--furnaces that burned matter,\ndesigned to warm a world! At last a state of stability had been reached,\nfor never could conditions change--it seemed. All external heat and\nlight came from far-off stars, the thousands of millions of suns that\nwould never fail.\n\n\"Under stress of the Great Change one scarcely noticed, yet almost\nincredible, transformation had occurred. We had learned to live with\neach other. We had learned to think, and enjoy thinking. As a species we\nhad passed from youth into maturity. Advancement did not stop; we went\non steadily toward the goal of all knowledge. At first there was an\nunderlying hope that we might some day, somehow, escape from these\ndarkened, artificial worlds of ours, but with the passing centuries this\ngrew very dim and at length was forgotten.\n\n\"Gradually as millennia passed, much ancient knowledge was also\nforgotten. It was not needed. The world was unchanging, there was no\nstrife, and no need of strife. The fifteen worlds were warm, and\npleasant, and safe. Without fully realizing it, we had entered a period\nof rest. And so the ages passed; and there were museums and libraries\nand laboratories; and the machines of our ancestors did all necessary\nwork. So it was--until less than a generation ago. Our long lives were\npleasant, and death, when it came, was a sleep. And then--\"\n\n\"And then,\" Taj Lamor interrupted, a sharp edge of impatience in his\ntone, \"some of us awakened from our stupor!\"\n\nThe Elder sighed resignedly. \"You cannot see--you cannot see. You would\nstart that struggle all over again!\" His voice continued in what Taj\nLamor thought of as a senile drone, but the younger man paid scant\nattention. His eyes and thoughts were centered on that brilliant yellow\nstar, the brightest object in the heavens. It was that star, noticeably\nbrighter within a few centuries, that had awakened a few men from their\nmental slumbers.\n\nThey were throwbacks, men who had the divine gift of curiosity; and\nsparked by their will to know, they had gone to the museums and looked\ncarefully at the ancient directions for the use of the telectroscope,\nthe mighty electrically amplified vision machine, had gazed through it.\nThey had seen a great sun that seemed to fill all the field of the\napparatus with blazing fire. A sun to envy! Further observation had\nrevealed that there circled about the sun a series of planets, five,\ndefinitely; two more, probably; and possibly two others.\n\nTaj Lamor had been with that group, a young man then, scarcely more than\nforty, but they had found him a leader and they had followed him as he\nset about his investigation of the ancient books on astronomy.\n\nHow many, many hours had he studied those ancient works! How many times\nhad he despaired of ever learning their truths, and gone out to the roof\nof the museum to stand in silent thought looking out across the awful\nvoid to the steady flame of the yellow star! Then quietly he had\nreturned to his self-set task.\n\nWith him as teacher, others had learned, and before he was seventy there\nwere many men who had become true scientists, astronomers. There was\nmuch of the ancient knowledge that these men could not understand, for\nthe science of a million centuries is not to be learned in a few brief\ndecades, but they mastered a vast amount of the forgotten lore.\n\nThey knew now that the young, live sun, out there in space, was speeding\ntoward them, their combined velocities equalling more than 100 miles\neach second. And they knew that there were not seven, but nine planets\ncircling about that sun. There were other facts they discovered; they\nfound that the new sun was far larger than theirs had ever been; indeed,\nit was a sun well above average in size and brilliance. There were\nplanets, a hot sun--a home! Could they get there?\n\nWhen their ancestors had tried to solve the problem of escape they had\nconcentrated their work on the problem of going at speeds greater than\nthat of light. This should be an impossibility, but the fact that the\nancients had tried it, seemed proof enough to their descendants that it\nwas possible, at least in theory. In the distant past they had needed\nspeeds exceeding that of light, for they must travel light years; but\nnow this sun was coming toward them, and already was less than two\nhundred and fifty billion miles away!\n\nThey would pass that other star in about seventy years. That was\nscarcely more than a third of a man's lifetime. They could make the\njourney with conceivable speeds--but in that brief period they must\nprepare to move!\n\nThe swift agitation for action had met with terrific resistance. They\nwere satisfied; why move?\n\nBut, while some men had devoted their time to arousing the people to\nhelp, others had begun doing work that had not been done for a long,\nlong time. The laboratories were reopened, and workshops began humming\nagain. They were making things that were new once more, not merely\ncopying old designs.\n\nTheir search had been divided into sections, search for weapons with\nwhich to defend themselves in case they were attacked, and search for\nthe basic principles underlying the operation of their space ships. They\nhad machines which they could imitate, but they did not understand them.\nSuccess had been theirs on these quests. The third section had been less\nsuccessful. They had also been searching for secrets of the apparatus\ntheir forefathers had used to swing the planets in their orbits, to move\nworlds about at will. They had wanted to be able to take not only their\nspace ships, but their planets as well, when they went to settle on\nthese other worlds and in this other solar system.\n\nBut the search for this secret had remained unrewarded. The secret of\nthe spaceships they learned readily, and Taj Lamor had designed these\nmighty ships below there with that knowledge. Their search for weapons\nhad been satisfied; they had found one weapon, one of the deadliest that\ntheir ancestors had ever invented. But the one secret in which they were\nmost interested, the mighty force barrage that could swing a world in\nits flight through space, was lost. They could not find it.\n\nThey knew the principles of the driving apparatus of their ships, and it\nwould seem but a matter of enlargement to drive a planet as a ship, but\nthey knew this was impossible; the terrific forces needed would easily\nbe produced by their apparatus, but there was no way to apply them to a\nworld. If applied in any spot, the planet would be torn asunder by the\nincalculable strain. They must apply the force equally to the entire\nplanet. Their problem was one of application of power. The rotation of\nthe planet made it impossible to use a series of driving apparatus, even\ncould these be anchored, but again the sheer immensity of the task made\nit impossible.\n\nTaj Lamor gazed down again at the great ships in the plaza below. Their\nmighty bulks seemed to dwarf even the huge buildings about them. Yet\nthese ships were his--for he had learned their secrets and designed\nthem, and now he was to command them as they flew out across space in\nthat flight to the distant star.\n\nHe turned briefly to the Elder, Tordos Gar. \"Soon we leave,\" he said, a\nfaint edge of triumph in his voice. \"We will prove that our way is\nright.\"\n\nThe old man shook his head. \"You will learn--\" he began, but Taj Lamor\ndid not want to hear.\n\nHe turned, passed through a doorway, and stepped into a little\ntorpedo-shaped car that rested on the metal roof behind him. A moment\nlater the little ship rose, and then slanted smoothly down over the edge\nof the roof, straight for the largest of the ships below. This was the\nflagship. Nearly a hundred feet greater was its diameter, and its mile\nand a quarter length of gleaming metal hull gave it nearly three hundred\nfeet greater length than that of the ships of the line.\n\nThis expedition was an expedition of exploration. They were prepared to\nmeet any conditions on those other worlds--no atmosphere, no water, no\nheat, or even an atmosphere of poisonous gases they could rectify, for\ntheir transmutation apparatus would permit them to change those gases,\nor modify them; they knew well how to supply heat, but they knew too,\nthat that sun would warm some of its planets sufficiently for their\npurposes.\n\nTaj Lamor sent his little machine darting through the great airlock in\nthe side of the gigantic interstellar ship and lowered it gently to the\nfloor. A man stepped forward, opened the door for the leader, saluting\nhim briskly as he stepped out; then the car was run swiftly aside, to be\nplaced with thousands of others like it. Each of these cars was to be\nused by a separate investigator when they reached those other worlds,\nand there were men aboard who would use them.\n\nTaj Lamor made his way to a door in the side of a great metal tube that\nthreaded the length of the huge ship. Opening the door he sat down in\nanother little car that shot swiftly forward as the double door shut\nsoftly, with a low hiss of escaping air. For moments the car sped\nthrough the tube, then gently it slowed and came to rest opposite\nanother door. Again came the hissing of gas as the twin doors opened,\nand Taj Lamor stepped out, now well up in the nose of the cruiser. As he\nstepped out of the car the outer and inner doors closed, and, ready now\nfor other calls, the car remained at this station. On a ship so long,\nsome means of communication faster than walking was essential. This\nlittle pneumatic railway was the solution.\n\nAs Taj Lamor stepped out of the tube, a half-dozen men, who had been\ntalking among themselves, snapped quickly to attention. Following the\nplans of the long-gone armies of their ancestors, the men of the\nexpedition had been trained to strict discipline; and Taj Lamor was\ntheir technical leader and the nominal Commander-in-Chief, although\nanother man, Kornal Sorul, was their actual commander.\n\nTaj Lamor proceeded at once to the Staff Cabin in the very nose of the\ngreat ship. Just above him there was another room, walled on all sides\nby that clear, glass-like material, the control cabin. Here the pilot\nsat, directing the motions of the mighty ship of space.\n\nTaj Lamor pushed a small button on his desk and in a moment a gray disc\nbefore him glowed dimly, then flashed into life and full, natural color.\nAs though looking through a glass porthole, Taj Lamor saw the interior\nof the Communications Room. The Communications Officer was gazing at a\nsimilar disc in which Taj Lamor's features appeared.\n\n\"Have they reported from Ohmur, Lorsand, and Throlus, yet, Morlus Tal?\"\nasked the commander.\n\n\"They are reporting now, Taj Lamor, and we will be ready within two and\none half minutes. The plans are as before; we are to proceed directly\ntoward the Yellow Star, meeting at Point 71?\"\n\n\"The plans are as before. Start when ready.\"\n\nThe disc faded, the colors died, and it was gray again. Taj Lamor pulled\nanother small lever on the panel before him, and the disc changed,\nglowed, and was steady; and now he saw the preparations for departure,\nas from an eye on the top of the great ship. Men streamed swiftly in\nordered columns all about and into the huge vessels. In an incredibly\nshort time they were in, and the great doors closed behind them.\nSuddenly there came a low, dull hum through the disc, and the sound\nmounted quickly, till all the world seemed humming to that dull note.\nThe warning!\n\nAbruptly the city around him seemed to blaze in a riot of colored light!\nThe mighty towering bulks of the huge metal buildings were polished and\nbright, and now, as the millions of lights, every color of the spectrum,\nflashed over all the city from small machines in the air, on the ground,\nin windows, their great metal walls glistening with a riot of flowing\ncolor. Then there was a trembling through all the frame of the mighty\nship. In a moment it was gone, and the titanic mass of glistening metal\nrose smoothly, quickly to the great roof of their world above them. On\nan even keel it climbed straight up, then suddenly it leaped forward\nlike some great bird of prey sighting its victim. The ground beneath\nsped swiftly away, and behind it there came a long line of ships,\nquickly finding their position in the formation. They were heading\ntoward the giant airlock that would let them out into space. There was\nbut one lock large enough to permit so huge a ship to pass out, and they\nmust circle half their world to reach it.\n\nOn three other worlds there were other giant ships racing thus to meet\nbeyond their solar system. There were fifty ships coming from each\nplanet; two hundred mighty ships in all made up this Armada of Space,\ntwo hundred gargantuan interstellar cruisers.\n\nOne by one the giant ships passed through the airlock and out into\nspace. Here they quickly reformed as they moved off together, each ship\nfalling into its place in the mighty cone formation, with the flagship\nof Taj Lamor at the head. On they rushed through space, their speed ever\nmounting. Suddenly there seemed to leap out of nowhere another mass of\nshining machines that flew swiftly beside them. Like some strange,\nshining ghosts, these ships seemed to materialize instantly beside and\nbehind their fleet. They fell in quickly in their allotted position\nbehind the Flagship's squadron. One--two more fleets appeared thus\nsuddenly in the dark, and together the ships were flashing on through\nspace to their goal of glowing fire ahead!\n\nHour after hour, day after day the ships flashed on through the awful\nvoid, the utter silence relieved by the communications between\nthemselves and the slowly weakening communications from the far-off home\nplanets.\n\nBut as those signals from home grew steadily weaker, the sun before them\ngrew steadily larger. At last the men began to feel the heat of those\nrays, to realize the energy that that mighty sea of flame poured forth\ninto space, and steadily they watched it grow nearer.\n\nThen came a day when they could make out clearly the dim bulk of a\nplanet before them, and for long hours they slowed down the flying speed\nof the ships. They had mapped the system they were approaching; there\nwere nine planets of varying sizes, some on the near and some on the\nfar side of the sun. There were but three on the near side; one that\nseemed the outermost of the planets, about 35,000 miles in diameter, was\ndirectly in their path, while there were two more much nearer the sun,\nabout 100,000,000 and 70,000,000 miles distant from it, each about seven\nto eight thousand miles in diameter, but they were on opposite sides of\nthe sun. These more inviting and more accessible worlds were numbers two\nand three of the planetary system. It was decided to split the\nexpedition into two parts; one part was to go to planet two, and the\nother to three. Taj Lamor was to lead his group of a hundred ships to\nthe nearer planet at once.\n\nIn a very brief time the great ships slanted down over what seemed to be\na mighty globe of water. They were well in the northern hemisphere, and\nthey had come near the planet first over a vast stretch of rolling\nocean. The men had looked in wonder at such vast quantities of the\nfluid. To them it was a precious liquid, that must be made artificially,\nand was to be conserved, yet here they saw such vast quantities of\nnatural water as seemed impossible. Still, their ancient books had told\nof such things, and of other strange things, things that must have been\nwondrously beautiful, though they were so old now, these records, that\nthey were regarded largely as myths.\n\nYet here were the strange proofs! They saw great masses of fleecy water\nvapor, huge billowy things that seemed solid, but were blown lightly in\nthe wind. And natural air! The atmosphere extended for hundreds of miles\noff into space; and now, as they came closer to the surface of this\nworld the air was dense, and the sky above them was a beautiful blue,\nnot black, even where there were stars. The great sun, so brilliantly\nincandescent when seen from space, and now a glowing globe of\nreddish-yellow.\n\nAnd as they came near land, they looked in wonder at mighty masses of\nrock and soil that threw their shaggy heads high above the surrounding\nterrain, huge masses that rose high, like waves in the water, till they\ntowered in solemn grandeur miles into the air! What a sight for these\nmen of a world so old that age long erosion had washed away the last\ntraces of hills, and filled in all of the valleys!\n\nIn awe they looked down at the mighty rock masses, as they swung low\nover the mountains, gazing in wonder at the green masses of the strange\nvegetation; strange, indeed, for they for uncounted ages had grown only\nmushroom-like cellulose products, and these mainly for ornament, for all\ntheir food was artificially made in huge factories.\n\nThen they came over a little mountain lake, a body of water scarcely\nlarge enough to berth one of their huge ships, but high in the clear air\nof the mountains, fed by the melting of eternal snows. It was a\nmagnificent sapphire in a setting green as emerald, a sparkling lake of\nclear water, deep as the sea, high in a cleft in the mountains.\n\nIn wonder the men looked down at these strange sights. What a marvelous\nhome!\n\nSteadily the great machines proceeded, and at last the end of the giant\nmountain was reached, and they came to a great plain. But that plain was\nstrangely marked off with squares, as regularly as though plotted with a\ndraftsman's square. This world must be inhabited by intelligent beings!\n\nSuddenly Taj Lamor saw strange specks off in the far horizon to the\nsouth, specks that seemed to grow in size with terrific velocity; these\nmust be ships, the ships of these people, coming to defend their home.\nThe strangely pallid face of Taj Lamor tightened into lines of grim\nresolution. This was a moment he had foreseen and had dreaded. Was he to\nwithdraw and leave these people unmolested, or was he to stand and fight\nfor this world, this wonderfully beautiful home, a home that his race\ncould live in for millions of years to come? He had debated this\nquestion many times before in his mind, and he had decided. There would\nnever, never be another chance for his people to gain a new home. They\nmust fight.\n\nSwiftly he gave his orders. If resistance came, if an attack were made,\nthey were to fight back at once, with every weapon at their disposal.\n\nThe strangers' ships had grown swiftly larger to the eye, but still,\nthough near now, they seemed too small to be dangerous. These giant\ninterstellar cruisers were certainly invulnerable to ships so small;\ntheir mere size would give them protection! These ships were scarcely as\nlong as the diameter of the smaller of the interstellar ships--a bare\ntwo hundred and fifty feet for the largest.\n\nThe interstellar cruisers halted in their course, and waited for the\nlittle ships to approach. They were fast, for they drew alongside\nquickly, and raced to the front of the flagship. There was one small one\nthat was painted white, and on it there was a large white banner,\nflapping in the wind of its passage. The rest of the ships drew off as\nthis came forward, and stopped, hanging motionless before the control\nroom of the giant machine. There were men inside--three strange men,\nshort and oddly pink-skinned--but they were gesturing now, motioning\nthat the giant machine settle to the ground beneath. Taj Lamor was\nconsidering whether or not to thus parley with the strangers, when\nsuddenly there leaped from the white craft a beam of clear white--a beam\nthat was directed toward the ground, then swung up toward the great\ncruiser in a swift arc!\n\nAs one, a dozen swift beams of pale red flared out from the giant and\nbathed the pigmy craft. As they reached it, the white ray that had been\nsweeping up suddenly vanished, and for an instant the ship hung poised\nin the air; then it began to swing crazily, like the pendulum of a\nclock--swung completely over--and with a sickening lurch sped swiftly\nfor the plain nearly five miles below. In moments there came a brief\nflare, then there remained only a little crater in the soft soil.\n\nBut the red beams had not stopped with the little ship; they had darted\nout to the other machines, trying to reach them before they could bring\nthose strange white rays into play. The cruisers obviously must win, for\nthey carried dozens of projectors, but they might be damaged, their\nflight delayed. They must defeat those strangers quickly. The rays of\nTaj Lamor's ship lashed out swiftly, but almost before they had\nstarted, all the other ships, a full hundred, were in action, and the\nflagship was darting swiftly up and away from the battle. Below, those\npale red rays were taking a swift toll of the little ships, and nearly\ntwenty of them rolled suddenly over, and dashed to destruction far\nbelow.\n\nBut now the little ships were in swift darting motion. Because of their\nsmall size, they were able to avoid the rays of the larger interstellar\ncruisers, and as their torpedo-shaped hulls flashed about with\nbewildering speed, they began to fight back. They had been taken utterly\nby surprise, but now they went into action with an abandon and swiftness\nthat took the initiative away from the gigantic interstellar liners.\nThey were in a dozen places at once, dodging and twisting, unharmed, out\nof the way of the deadly red beams, and were as hard to hit as so many\ndancing feathers suspended over an air jet.\n\nAnd if the pilots were skillful in avoiding enemy rays, their ray men\nwere as accurate in placing theirs. But then, with a target of such vast\nsize, not so much skill was necessary.\n\nThese smaller vessels were the ships of Earth. The people of the dark\nstar had entered the solar system quite unannounced, except that they\nhad been seen in passing the orbit of Mars, for a ship had been out\nthere in space, moving steadily out toward Neptune, and the great\ninterstellar cruisers, flashing in across space, away from that frigid\nplanet, had not seen the tiny wanderer. But he had seen those mighty\nhulks, and had sent his message of danger out on the ether, warning the\nmen of Earth. They had relayed it to Venus, and the ships that had gone\nthere had received an equally warm reception, and were even now finding\ntheir time fully occupied trying to beat off the Interplanetary Patrol.\n\nThe battle ended as swiftly as it began, for Taj Lamor, in his machine\nhigh above, saw that they were outclassed, and ordered them to withdraw\nat once. Scarcely ten minutes had elapsed, yet they had lost twenty-two\nof their giant ships.\n\nThe expedition that had gone to Venus reported a similarly active\ngreeting. It was decided at once that they should proceed cautiously to\nthe other planets, to determine which were inhabited and which were not,\nand to determine the chemical and physical conditions on each.\n\nThe ships formed again out in space, on the other side of the sun,\nhowever, and started at once in compact formation for Mercury.\n\nTheir observations were completed without further mishap, and they set\nout for their distant home, their number depleted by forty-one ships,\nfor nineteen had fallen on Venus.\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\nThe Terrestrian and Venerian governments had met in conference, a grim,\nbusinesslike discussion with few wasted words. Obviously, this was to be\na war of science, a war on a scale never before known on either world.\nAgreements were immediately drawn up between the two worlds for a\nconcerted, cooperative effort. A fleet of new and vastly more powerful\nships must be constructed--but first they must have a complete report on\nthe huge invading craft that had fallen in western Canada, and on Venus,\nfor they might conceivably make their secrets their own.\n\nThey called for the scientists whose work had made possible their\nsuccessful resistance of the marauders: Arcot, Morey and Wade. They\nfound them working in the Arcot Laboratories.\n\n\"Wade,\" called Arcot tensely as he snapped the switch of the\ntelevisophone, \"bring Morey and meet me at the machine on the roof at\nonce. That was a call from Washington. I'll explain as soon as you get\nthere.\"\n\nOn the roof Arcot opened the hangar doors, and entered the\nfive-passenger molecular motion ship inside. Its sleek, streamlined\nsides spoke of power and speed. This was a special research model,\ndesigned for their experiments, and carrying mechanisms not found in\ncommercial crafts. Among these were automatic controls still in the\nlaboratory stage, but permitting higher speed, for no human being could\ncontrol the ship as accurately as these.\n\nIt took the trio a little less than a quarter of an hour to make the\n5,000 mile trip from New York to the battlefield of Canada. As they sped\nthrough the air, Arcot told them what had transpired. The three were\npassed through the lines at once, and they settled to the ground beside\none of the huge ships that lay half buried in the ground. The force of\nthe impact had splashed the solid soil as a stone will splash soft mud,\nand around the ship there was a massive ridge of earth. Arcot looked at\nthe titanic proportions of this ship from space, and turned to his\nfriends:\n\n\"We can investigate that wreck on foot, but I think it'll be far more\nsensible to see what we can do with the car. This monster is certainly a\nmile or more long, and we'd spend more time in walking than in\ninvestigation. I suggest, we see if there isn't room for the car inside.\nThis beats even those huge Kaxorian planes for size.\" Arcot paused, then\ngrinned. \"I sure would have liked to mix in the fight they must have had\nhere--nice little things to play with, aren't they?\"\n\n\"It would make a nice toy,\" agreed Wade as he looked at the rows of\nwicked-looking projectors along the sides of the metal hull, \"and I\nwonder if there might not be some of the crew alive in there? If there\nare, the size of the ship would prevent their showing themselves very\nquickly, and since they can't move the ship, it seems to me that they'll\nlet us know shortly that they're around. Probably, with the engines\nstopped, their main weapons are useless, but they would doubtless have\nsome sort of guns. I'm highly in favor of using the car. We carry a\nmolecular director ray, so if the way is blocked, we can make a new\none.\"\n\nWade's attention was caught by a sudden flare of light a few miles\nacross the plain. \"Look over there--that ship is still flaming--reddish,\nbut almost colorless. Looks like a gas flame, with a bit of calcium in\nit. Almost as if the air in the ship were combustible. If we should do\nany exploring in this baby, I suggest we use altitude suits--they can't\ndo any harm in any case.\"\n\nThree or four of the great wrecks, spread over a wide area, were burning\nnow, hurling forth long tongues of colorless, intensely hot flame.\nSeveral of the ships had been only slightly damaged; one had been\nbrought down by a beam that had torn free the entire tail of the ship,\nleaving the bow in good condition. Apparently this machine had not\nfallen far; perhaps the pilot had retained partial control of the ship,\nhis power failing when he was only a comparatively short distance from\nEarth. This was rather well to one side of the plain, however, and they\ndecided to investigate it later.\n\nThe ship nearest them had crashed nose first, the point being crushed\nand shattered. Arcot maneuvered his craft cautiously toward the great\nhole at the nose of the ship, and they entered the mighty vessel slowly,\na powerful spotlight illuminating the interior. Tremendous girders,\ntwisted and broken by the force of impact, thrust up about them. It soon\nbecame evident that there was little to fear from any living enemies,\nand they proceeded more rapidly. Certainly no creature could live after\nthe shock that had broken these huge girders! Several times metal beams\nblocked their path, and they were forced to use the molecular director\nray to bend them out of the way.\n\n\"Man,\" said Arcot as they stopped a moment to clear away a huge member\nthat was bent across their path, \"but those beams do look as if they\nwere built permanently! I'd hate to ram into one of them! Look at that\none--if that has anywhere near the strength of steel, just think of the\nforce it took to bend it!\"\n\nAt last they had penetrated to the long tube that led through the length\nof the ship, the communication tube. This admitted the small ship\neasily, and they moved swiftly along till they came to what they\nbelieved to be about the center of the invader. Here Arcot proposed that\nthey step out and see what there was to be seen.\n\nThe others agreed, and they at once put on their altitude suits of heavy\nrubberized canvas, designed to be worn outside the ship when at high\naltitude, or even in space. They were supplied with oxygen tanks that\nwould keep the wearer alive for about six hours. Unless the atmosphere\nremaining in the alien ship was excessively corrosive, they would be\nsafe. After a brief discussion, they decided that all would go, for if\nthey met opposition, there would be strength in numbers.\n\nThey met their first difficulty in opening the door leading out of the\ncommunication tube. It was an automatic door, and resisted their every\neffort--until finally they were forced to tear it out with a ray. It was\nimpossible to move it in any other way. The door was in what was now the\nfloor, since the ship seemed to have landed on one side rather than on\nits keel.\n\nThey let themselves through the narrow opening one at a time, and landed\non the sloping wall of the corridor beyond.\n\n\"Lucky this wasn't a big room, or we'd have had a nice drop to the far\nwall!\" commented Wade. The suits were equipped with a thin vibrating\ndiaphragm that made speech easy, but Wade's voice came through with a\nqueerly metallic ring.\n\nArcot agreed somewhat absently, his attention directed toward their\nsurroundings. His hand light pierced the blackness, finally halting at a\ngaping opening, apparently the entrance to a corridor. As they examined\nit, they saw that it slanted steeply downward.\n\n\"It seems to be quite a drop,\" said Wade as he turned his light into it,\n\"but the surface seems to be rather rough. I think we can do it. I\nnotice that you brought a rope, Morey; I think it'll help. I'll go\nfirst, unless someone else wants the honor.\"\n\n\"You go first?\" Arcot hesitated briefly. \"But I don't know--if we're\nall going, I guess you had better, at that. It would take two ordinary\nmen to lower a big bulk like you. On the other hand, if anybody is going\nto stay, you're delegated as elevator boy!\n\n\"Hold everything,\" continued Arcot. \"I have an idea. I think none of us\nwill need to hold the weight of the others with the rope. Wade, will you\nget three fairly good-sized pieces of metal, something we can tie a rope\nto? I think we can get down here without the help of anyone else. Morey,\nwill you cut the rope in three equal pieces while I help Wade tear loose\nthat girder?\"\n\nArcot refused to reveal his idea till his preparations were complete,\nbut worked quickly and efficiently. With the aid of Wade, he soon had\nthree short members, and taking the rope that Morey had prepared, he\ntied lengths of cord to the pieces of metal, leaving twenty foot lengths\nhanging from each. Now he carefully tested his handiwork to make sure\nthe knots would not slip.\n\n\"Now, let's see what we can do.\" Arcot put a small loop in one end of a\ncord, thrust his left wrist through this, and grasped the rope firmly\nwith his hand. Then he drew his ray pistol, and adjusted it carefully\nfor direction of action. The trigger gave him control over power.\nFinally he turned the ray on the block of metal at the other end of the\nrope. At once the metal pulled vigorously, drawing the rope taut, and as\nArcot increased the power, he was dragged slowly across the floor.\n\n\"Ah--it works.\" He grinned broadly over his shoulder. \"Come on, boys,\nhitch your wagon to a star, and we'll go on with the investigation. This\nis a new, double action parachute. It lets you down easy, and pulls you\nup easier! I think we can go where we want now.\" After a pause he added,\n\"I don't have to tell you that too much power will be very bad!\"\n\nWith Arcot's simple brake, they lowered themselves into the corridor\nbelow, descending one at a time, to avoid any contact with the ray,\nsince the touch of the beam was fatal.\n\nThe scene that lay before them was one of colossal destruction. They had\nevidently stumbled upon the engine room. They could not hope to\nilluminate its vast expanse with their little hand lights, but they\ncould gain some idea of its magnitude, and of its original layout. The\nfloor, now tilted at a steep angle, was torn up in many places, showing\ngreat, massive beams, buckled and twisted like so many wires, while the\nheavy floor plates were crumpled like so much foil. Everywhere the room\nseemed covered with a film of white silvery metal; it was silver, they\ndecided after a brief examination, spattered broadcast over the walls of\nthe room.\n\nSuddenly Morey pointed ceilingward with his light. \"That's where the\nsilver came from!\" he exclaimed. A network of heavy bars ran across the\nroof, great bars of solid silver fully three feet thick. In one section\ngaped a ragged hole, suggesting the work of a disintegration ray, a hole\nthat went into the metal roof above, one which had plainly been fused,\nas had the great silver bars.\n\nArcot looked in wonder at the heavy metal bars. \"Lord--bus bars three\nfeet thick! What engines they must have! Look at the way those were\nblown out! They were short circuited by the crash, just before the\ngenerator went out, and they were volatilized! Some juice!\"\n\nWith the aid of their improvised elevators, the three men attempted to\nexplore the tremendous chamber. They had scarcely begun, when Wade\nexclaimed:\n\n\"Bodies!\"\n\nThey crowded around his gruesome find and caught their first glimpse of\nthe invaders from space. Anatomical details could not be distinguished\nsince the bodies had been caught under a rain of crushing beams, but\nthey saw that they were not too different from both Terrestrians and\nVenerians--though their blood seemed strangely pallid, and their skin\nwas of a ghastly whiteness. Evidently they had been assembled before an\nunfamiliar sort of instrument panel when catastrophe struck; Morey\nindicated the dials and keys.\n\n\"Nice to know what you're fighting,\" Arcot observed. \"I've a hunch that\nwe'll see some of these critters alive--but not in this ship!\"\n\nThey turned away and resumed their examination of the shattered\nmechanisms.\n\nA careful examination was impossible; they were wrecks, but Arcot did\nsee that they seemed mainly to be giant electrical machines of standard\ntypes, though on a gargantuan scale. There were titanic masses of\nwrecked metal, iron and silver, for with these men silver seemed to\nreplace copper, though nothing could replace iron and its magnetic uses.\n\n\"They are just electrical machines, I guess,\" said Arcot at last. \"But\nwhat size! Have you seen anything really revolutionary, Wade?\"\n\nWade frowned and answered. \"There are just two things that bother me.\nCome here.\" As Arcot jumped over, nearly suspended by his ray pistol,\nWade directed his light on a small machine that had fallen in between\nthe cracks in the giant mass of broken generators. It was a little\nthing, apparently housed in a glass case. There was only one objection\nto that assumption. The base of a large generator lay on it, metal fully\ntwo feet thick, and that metal was cracked where it rested on the case,\nand the case, made of material an inch and a half thick, was not dented!\n\n\"Whewww--that's a nice kind of glass to have!\" Morey commented. \"I'd\nlike to have a specimen for examination. Oh--I wonder--yes, it must be!\nThere's a window in the side up there toward what was the bow that\nseemed to me to be the same stuff. It's buried about three feet in solid\nearth, so I imagine it must be.\"\n\nThe three made their way at once to where they had seen the window. The\nframe appeared to be steel, or some such alloy, and it was twisted and\nbent under the blow, for this was evidently the outer wall, and the\nimpact of landing had flattened the rounded side. But that \"glass\"\nwindow was quite undisturbed! There was, as a further proof, a large\ngranite boulder lying against it on the outside--or what had been a\nboulder, though it had been shattered by the impact.\n\n\"Say--that's some building material!\" Arcot indicated the transparent\nsheet. \"Just look at that granite rock--smashed into sand! Yet the\nwindow isn't even scratched! Look how the frame that held it is\ntorn--just torn, not broken. I wonder if we can tear it loose\naltogether?\" He stepped forward, raising his pistol. There was a thud as\nhis metal bar crashed down when the ray was shut off. Then, as the\nothers got out of the way, he stepped toward the window and directed his\nbeam toward it. Gradually he increased the power, till suddenly there\nwas a rending crash, and they saw only a leaping column of earth and\nsand and broken granite flying up through the hole in the steel shell.\nThere was a sudden violent crash, then a moment later a second equally\nviolent crash as the window, having flown up to the ceiling, came\nthumping back to the floor.\n\nAfter the dust had settled they came forward, looking for the window.\nThey found it, somewhat buried by the rubbish, lying off to one side.\nArcot bent down to tilt it and sweep off the dirt; he grasped it with\none hand, and pulled. The window remained where it was. He grasped it\nwith both hands and pulled harder. The window remained where it was.\n\n\"Uh--say, lend a hand will you, Wade.\" Together the two men pulled, but\nwithout results. That window was about three feet by two feet by one\ninch, making the total volume about one-half a cubic foot, but it\ncertainly was heavy. They could not begin to move it. An equal volume of\nlead would have weighed about four hundred pounds, but this was\ndecidedly more than four hundred pounds. Indeed, the combined strength\nof the three men did not do more than rock it.\n\n\"Well--it certainly is no kind of matter we know of!\" observed Morey.\n\"Osmium, the heaviest known metal, has a density of twenty-two and a\nhalf, which would weigh about 730 pounds. I think we could lift that, so\nthis is heavier than anything we know. At least that's proof of a new\nsystem. Between Venus and Earth we have found every element that occurs\nin the sun. These people must have come from another star!\"\n\n\"Either that,\" returned Arcot, \"or proof of an amazing degree of\ntechnological advancement. It's only a guess, of course--but I have an\nidea where this kind of matter exists in the solar system. I think you\nhave already seen it--in the gaseous state. You remember, of course,\nthat the Kaxorians had great reservoirs for storing light-energy in a\nbound state in their giant planes. They had bound light, light held by\nthe gravitational attraction for itself, after condensing it in their\napparatus, but they had what amounted to a gas--gaseous light. Now\nsuppose that someone makes a light condenser even more powerful than the\none the Kaxorians used, a condenser that forces the light so close to\nitself, increases its density, till the photons hold each other\npermanently, and the substance becomes solid. It will be matter, matter\nmade of light--light matter--and let us call it a metal. You know that\nordinary matter is electricity matter, and electricity matter metals\nconduct electricity readily. Now why shouldn't our 'light matter' metal\nconduct light? It would be a wonderful substance for windows.\"\n\n\"But now comes the question of moving it,\" Wade interposed. \"We can't\nlift it, and we certainly want to examine it. That means we must take it\nto the laboratory. I believe we're about through here--the place is\nclearly quite permanently demolished. I think we had better return to\nthe ship and start to that other machine we saw that didn't appear to be\nso badly damaged. But--how can we move this?\"\n\n\"I think a ray may do the trick.\" Arcot drew his ray pistol, and stepped\nback a bit, holding the weapon so the ray would direct the plate\nstraight up. Slowly he applied the power, and as he gradually increased\nit, the plate stirred, then moved into the air.\n\n\"It works! Now you can use your pistol, Morey, and direct it toward the\ncorridor. I'll send it up, and let it fall outside, where we can pick it\nup later.\" Morey stepped forward, and while Arcot held it in the air\nwith his ray, Morey propelled it slowly with his, till it was directly\nunder the corridor leading upward. Then Arcot gave a sudden increase in\npower, and the plate moved swiftly upward, sailing out of sight. Arcot\nshut off his ray, and there came to their ears a sudden crash as the\nplate fell to the floor above.\n\nThe three men regained their ropes and \"double action parachutes\" as\nArcot called them, and floated up to the next floor. Again they started\nthe process of moving the plate. All went well till they came to the\nlittle car itself. They could not use the ray on the car, for fear of\ndamaging the machinery. They had to use some purely mechanical method of\nhoisting it in.\n\nFinally they solved the problem by using the molecular director ray to\nswing a heavy beam into the air, then one man pulled on the far end of\nit with a rope, and swung it till it was resting on the door of the ship\non one end, and the other rested in a hole they had torn in the lining\nof the tube.\n\nNow they maneuvered the heavy plate till it was resting on that beam;\nthen they released the plate, and watched it slide down the incline,\nshooting through the open doorway of the car. In moments the job was\ndone. The plate at last safely stowed, the three men climbed into the\ncar, and prepared to leave.\n\nThe little machine glided swiftly down the tube through the mighty ship,\nfinally coming out through the opening that had admitted them. They rose\nquickly into the air, and headed for the headquarters of the government\nships.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nA great number of scientists and military men were already gathered\nabout the headquarters ship. As Arcot's party arrived, they learned that\neach of the wrecks was being assigned to one group. They further learned\nthat because of their scientific importance, they were to go to the\nnearly perfect ship lying off to the west. Two Air Patrolmen were to\naccompany them.\n\n\"Lieutenant Wright and Lieutenant Greer will go with you,\" said the\nColonel. \"In the event of trouble from possible--though\nunlikely--survivors, they may be able to help. Is there anything further\nwe can do?\"\n\n\"These men are armed with the standard sidearms, aren't they?\" Arcot\nasked. \"I think we'll all be better off if I arm them with some of the\nnew director-ray pistols. I have several in my boat. It will be all\nright, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Certainly, Dr. Arcot. They are under your command.\"\n\nThe party, increased to five now, returned to the ship, where Arcot\nshowed the men the details of the ray pistols, and how to use them. The\ncontrol for direction of operation was rather intricate in these early\nmodels, and required considerable explanation. The theoretical range of\neven these small hand weapons was infinity in space, but in the\natmosphere the energy was rather rapidly absorbed by ionization of the\nair, and the dispersion of the beam made it ineffective in space over a\nrange of more than thirty-five miles.\n\nAgain entering the little molecular motion car, they went at once to the\ngreat hull of the fallen ship. They inspected it cautiously from\noverhead before going too close, for the dreadnought, obviously, had\nlanded without the terrific concussion that the others had experienced,\nand there was a possibility that some of the crew had survived the\ncrash. The entire stern of the huge vessel had been torn off, and\nevidently the ship was unable to rise, but there were lights glowing\nthrough the portholes on the side, indicating that power had not failed\ncompletely.\n\n\"I think we'd better treat that monster with respect,\" remarked Wade,\nlooking down at the lighted windows. \"They have power, and the hull is\nscarcely dented except where the stern was caught by a beam. It's lucky\nwe had those ray projector ships! They've been in service only about\nfour months, haven't they, Lieutenant?\"\n\n\"Just about that, sir,\" the Air Patrolman replied. \"They hadn't gotten\nthe hand weapons out in sufficient quantities to be issued to us as\nyet.\"\n\nMorey scowled at the invader. \"I don't like this at all. I wonder why\nthey didn't greet us with some of their beams,\" he said in worried\ntones. It did seem that there should be some of the rays in action now.\nThey were less than a mile from the fallen giant, and moving rather\nslowly.\n\n\"I've been puzzled about that myself,\" commented Arcot, \"and I've come\nto the conclusion that either the ray projectors are fed by a separate\nsystem of power distribution, which has been destroyed, or that the\ncreatures from space are all dead.\"\n\nThey were to learn later, in their exploration of the ship, that the\ninvaders' ray projectors were fed from a separate generator, which\nproduced a special form of alternating current wave for them. This\ngenerator had been damaged beyond use.\n\nThe little machine was well toward the stern of the giant now, and they\nlowered it till it was on a level with the torn metal. It was plain that\nthe ship had been subjected to some terrific tension. The great girders\nwere stretched and broken, and the huge ribs were bent and twisted. The\ncentral tube, which ran the length of the ship, had been drawn down to\nabout three quarters of its original diameter, making it necessary for\nthem to use their ray to enter. In moments their speedster glided into\nthe dark tunnel. The searchlight reaching ahead filled the metal tunnel\nwith a myriad deceptive reflections. The tube was lighted up far ahead\nof them, and seemed empty. Cautiously they advanced, with Arcot at the\ncontrols.\n\n\"Wade--Morey--where will we stop first?\" he asked. \"The engines? They'll\nprobably be of prime importance. We know their location. What do you\nsay?\"\n\n\"I agree,\" replied Wade, and Morey nodded his approval.\n\nThey ran their craft down the long tube till they reached the door they\nknew must be the engine room landing, and stepped out, each wearing an\naltitude suit. This ship had landed level, and progress would be much\neasier than in the other one. They waited a moment before opening the\ndoor into the engine room, for this led into a narrow corridor where\nonly one could pass. Caution was definitely in order. The Air Patrolmen\ninsisted on leading the way. They had been sent along for the express\npurpose of protecting the scientists, and it was their duty to lead.\nAfter a brief argument Arcot agreed.\n\nThe two officers stepped to the door, and standing off to one side, tore\nit open with a ray from their pistols. It fell with a clatter to the\nrounded metal floor of the tube, and lay there vibrating noisily, but no\nrays of death lanced out from beyond it. Cautiously they peered around\nthe corner of the long corridor, then seeing nothing, entered. Wade came\nnext, then Arcot, followed by Morey.\n\nThe corridor was approximately thirty feet long, opening into the great\nengine room. Already the men could hear the smooth hum of powerful\nmachines, and could see the rounded backs of vast mechanisms. But there\nwas no sign of life, human or otherwise. They halted finally at the\nthreshold of the engine room.\n\n\"Well,\" Arcot said softly. \"We haven't seen anyone so far, and I hope no\none has seen us. The invaders may be behind one of those big engines,\nquite unaware of us. _If_ they're there, and they see us, they'll be\nready to fight. Now remember, those weapons you have will tear loose\nanything they hit, so take it easy. You know something about the power\nof those engines, so don't put them out of commission, and have them\nsplash us all over the landscape.\n\n\"But look out for the crew, and get them if they try to get you!\"\n\nCautiously but quickly they stepped out into the great room, forming a\nrough half circle, pistols ready for action. They walked forward\nstealthily, glancing about them--and simultaneously the enemies caught\nsight of each other. There were six of the invaders, each about seven\nfeet tall, and surprisingly humanoid. They somewhat resembled\nVenerians, but they weren't Venerians, for their skin was a strange\ngray-white, suggesting raw dough. It seemed to Arcot that these strange,\npale creatures were advancing at a slow walk, and that he stood still\nwatching them as they slowly raised strange hand weapons. He seemed to\nnotice every detail: their short, tight-fitting suits of some elastic\nmaterial that didn't hamper their movements, and their strange flesh,\nwhich just seemed to escape being transparent. Their eyes were strangely\nlarge, and the black spot of the pupil in their white corneas created an\nunnatural effect.\n\nThen abruptly their weapons came up--and Arcot responded with a sudden\nflick of his ray, as he flung himself to one side. Simultaneously his\nfour companions let their beams fly toward the invaders. They glowed\nstrangely red here, but they were still effective. The six beings were\nsuddenly gone--but not before they had released their own beams. And\nthey had taken toll. Lieutenant Wright lay motionless upon the floor.\n\nThe Terrestrians scarcely had a chance to notice this, for immediately\nthere was a terrific rending crash, and clean daylight came pouring in\nthrough a wide opening in the wall of the ship. The five rays had not\nstopped on contact with the enemy, but had touched the wall behind them.\nAn irregular opening now gaped in the smooth metal.\n\nSuddenly there came a second jarring thud, a dull explosion; then a\ngreat sheet of flame filled the hole--a wall of ruddy flame swept\nrapidly in. Arcot swung up his ray pistol, pointing it at the mass of\nflaming gas. A mighty column of air came through the narrow corridor\nfrom the tube, rushing toward the outside, and taking the flame with it.\nA roaring mass of gas hovered outside of the ship.\n\n\"Lieutenant,\" said Arcot, swiftly, \"turn your ray on that hole, and keep\nit there, blowing that flame outside with it. You'll find you can't put\nthe fire out, but if you keep it outside the ship, I believe we'll be\nreasonably safe.\" The Patrolman obeyed instantly, relieving Arcot.\n\nWade and Morey were already bending over the fallen man.\n\n\"I'm afraid there's nothing we can do for him,\" the latter said grimly,\n\"and every moment here is dangerous. Let's continue our investigation\nand carry him back to the ship when we leave.\" Arcot nodded silently.\n\nSolemnly they turned away from the motionless figure on the floor and\nset out on their investigation.\n\n\"Arcot,\" began Morey after a moment, \"why is that gas burning like that?\nCan't we put it out?\"\n\n\"Let's get through with this job first,\" replied Arcot somewhat tersely.\n\"The discussion comes after.\"\n\nThe bodies of the invaders were gone, so they could not examine them\nnow. That was a matter for the doctors and biologists, anyway. The\nengines were their main interest, huge things which overshadowed\neverything about them.\n\nIt must have been the concealment afforded by the engines that permitted\nthree of the enemy to get so close. The only warning the Terrestrians\nhad was a faint pink haze as they stepped around the corner of an\nengine; and a sudden feeling of faintness swept over them. They leaped\nback, out of sight, peering around the corner with nerves and muscles\ntensed. There was no sign of movement.\n\nAs they watched, they saw a pallid hand reaching out with a ray gun; and\nWade swiftly pointed his own weapon. There came a sudden crash of metal,\na groan and quiet. Two other aliens leaped from behind the great engine\njust as the Terrestrians dodged further back; as swiftly, they too found\nconcealment.\n\nArcot swung his ray up, and was about to pull the trigger that would\nsend the huge engine toppling over upon them, when he saw that it was\nrunning. He thought of the unknown energies in the machine, the\npotential destruction, and he shook his head. Cautiously he looked\naround the edge of the towering mass, waiting--his beam flashed out, and\nthere was a snapping sound as the ray caught a reaching hand and hurled\nits owner against a mighty transformer of some sort. For an instant the\nhuge mass tottered, then was still. In the low concentration of power\nthat Arcot had used, only a small portion had been touched, and the\nmolecules of this portion had not been enough to tip over its tremendous\nweight.\n\nOnly one enemy remained; and Arcot learned swiftly that he was still in\naction, for before he could dodge back there came that now-familiar pink\nhaziness. It touched Arcot's hand, outstretched as it had been when he\nfired, and a sudden numbness came over it. His pistol hand seemed to\nlose all feeling of warmth or cold. It was there; he could still feel\nthe weapon's deadened weight. Reflex action hurled him back, his hand\nout of range of the ray. In seconds feeling began to return, and in less\nthan ten his hand was normal again.\n\nHe turned to the others with a wry grin. \"Whew--that was a narrow\nsqueak! I must say their ray is a gentlemenly sort of thing. It either\nkills you, or doesn't injure you at all. There it goes again!\"\n\nA shaft of pink radiance reached the end of the engine, just grazing it,\nevidently absorbed by its mass. \"Pinning us down,\" Wade grated. They\ncertainly couldn't step out into the open space--but they couldn't stay\nwhere they were indefinitely, either. Reinforcements might arrive!\n\n\"Look,\" Wade pointed with his pistol, \"he's under that big metal bar--up\nthere in the roof--see it? I'll pull it down; he may get nervous and\ncome into sight.\" Swiftly Arcot sprang forward and caught his arm.\n\n\"Lord--don't do that, Wade--there's too much stuff here that we don't\nknow anything about. Too much chance of your smashing us with him. I'm\ngoing to try to get around to the other side of this machine and see\nwhat I can do, while you fellows keep him occupied.\"\n\nArcot disappeared around the black humming giant. Interminably the\nothers waited for something to happen; then suddenly the beam that had\nbeen playing at irregular intervals across the end of the machine, swung\nquickly to the other side; and simultaneously another ray seemed to leap\nfrom the machine itself. They met and crossed. There came a momentary\ncrashing arc, then both went dead, as the apparatus that generated them\nblew out under terrific overload.\n\nThe invader evidently carried a spare, for the watchers saw him dart\nfrom concealment, clawing at his pocket pouch. They turned their rays on\nhim, and just as his projector came free, a ray hurled him violently to\nthe left. He crashed into a huge motor, and the result was not nice.\n\nThe projector had been jerked from his hand and lay off to the side.\nArcot ran to it and picked it up just as they heard the Lieutenant call\nan alarmed inquiry.\n\n\"I think we're okay now,\" Arcot answered. \"I hope there are no more--but\nby all means stay where you are, and use as little power as possible in\nblowing that flame outside. It uses up the atmosphere of the ship, and\nthough we don't need it, I think we'd better take things easy. Call us\nif anything looks odd to you.\"\n\nFor several minutes the three scientists looked about them in awe-struck\nwonder. They were the first men of Earth to see the driving equipment of\none of the tremendous Kaxorian planes, and they felt tiny beside its\ngreat bulk; but now, as they examined this engine room, they realized\nthat even the huge plane shrank into insignificance beside this\ninterstellar cruiser.\n\nAll about them loomed the great rounded backs of giant electric\nmotor-generators of some sort. Across the roof ran a network of gigantic\nmetal bars, apparently conductors, but so large that they suggested\nheavy structural members. The machines they ran into loomed fully thirty\nfeet into the air; they were longer than cylinders, thirty feet in\ndiameter, and there was a group of four main machines fully a hundred\ntwenty feet long! There were many smaller mechanisms--yet these smaller\nones would easily have constituted a complete power supply for the\naverage big city. Along each wall ran a bank of transformers, cast in\nthe same heroic mold. These seemed connected with the smaller machines,\nthere being four conductors leading into each of the minor units, two\nintake, and two, apparently, output leads, suggesting rotary converters.\nThe multiple units and the various types and sizes of transformers made\nit obvious that many different frequencies were needed. Some of the\ntransformers had air cores, and led to machines surrounded with a\nsilvery white metal instead of the usual iron. These, apparently, were\ngenerating current at an extremely high frequency.\n\n\"Well,\" Morey commented, \"they ought to have power enough. But do you\nnotice that those four main units have their leads radiating in\ndifferent directions? The one on the left there seems to lead to that\nbig power board at the front--or better, bow. I think it would be worth\ninvestigating.\"\n\nArcot nodded. \"I had the same idea. You notice that two of the main\npower units are still working, but that those other two have stopped?\nProbably the two dead ones have something to do with the motion of the\nship. But there's one point I think is of even greater interest. All the\nmachines we have seen, all the conspicuous ones, are secondary power\nsources. There are no primary sources visible. Notice that those two\nmain conduits lead over to the right, and toward the bow. Let's check\nwhere they go to.\"\n\nAs they talked they followed the huge conductors back to their point of\nconvergence. Suddenly they rounded one of the huge main power units, and\nsaw before them, at the center of square formed by these machines, a low\nplatform of transparent light-metal. At the exact center of this\nplatform, which was twenty feet in diameter, there was a table, about\nseven feet across and raised about five feet above the level of the\nplatform on stout light-metal legs. On the table were two huge cubes of\nsolid silver, and into these cubes ran all the conductors they had seen.\n\nIn the space of about six inches left between the blocks of metal, there\nwas a small box constructed of some strange new material. It was the\nmost perfect reflecting surface that any of the men had ever imagined.\nIndeed, it was so perfect a reflector that they were unable to see it,\nbut could detect its presence only by the mirror images, and the fact\nthat it blotted out objects behind it.\n\nNow they noticed that through the huge blocks of metal there were two\nsmall holes, and two thin wires of this same reflecting material led\ninto those holes. The wires led directly up to the roof, and, suspended\non three-foot hangers of the light-metal, continued on toward the bow.\n\nCould this be the source of power for the entire ship? It seemed\nimpossible, yet there were many other seeming impossible things here,\namong them that strangely reflecting matter.\n\nThere was a low railing about the central platform, apparently intended\nto keep observers at a safe distance, so they decided against any more\ndetailed investigation. As they were about to discuss their unusual\nfind, the Lieutenant called that he heard sounds behind him.\n\nAt once the three ran rapidly toward the narrow corridor that had given\nthem entrance. The flaming gas was still shooting through the hole in\nthe wall of the ship, and the rush of air through the corridor made it\ndifficult to hear any sounds there, and exceedingly difficult to walk.\n\n\"Turn on more power, Lieutenant, and see if we can't draw out the\nenemy,\" suggested Arcot, while they braced themselves around the tube\nexit.\n\nAs the Patrolman increased the power of his beam, the moan of the air\nthrough the corridor increased suddenly to a terrific roar, and a\ncyclonic gale swept through. But none of the invaders were drawn out.\n\nAfter the Lieutenant had shut off the blast from his pistol at Arcot's\nsignal, the latter said: \"I don't think anything less than a war tank\ncould stand that pressure. It's probable that we'll be attacked if we\nstay here much longer, though--and we may not be able to get out at all.\nI think, Lieutenant, I'll ask you to stay here while we go out and get\nthe ship ready to leave.\" He paused, grinning. \"Be sure to keep that\nflame outside. You'll be in the position of Hercules after Atlas left\nhim holding the skies on his shoulders. You can't shut off the ray for\nlong or we'll have a first-rate explosion. We'll signal when we're ready\nby firing a revolver, and you make it to the ship as fast as you can\ntravel.\"\n\nArcot's expression became solemn. \"We'll have to carry Wright back to\nthe ship. He was a brave man, and he certainly deserves burial in the\nsoil of his own world. And, Morey, we'll have to look up his family.\nYour father's company will have to take care of them if they need help.\"\n\nSlowly the men forced their way back toward their ship, fighting against\nthe roaring column of air, their burden hindering them somewhat; but at\nlast they reached the open tunnel. Even here the air was in violent\nmotion.\n\nThey got into their boat as quickly as possible, and set the controls\nfor reverse flight. Then Wade fired the signal shot. In moments they saw\nLieutenant Greer bucking against the current of air, continuing under\nits own momentum.\n\nBy the time he was in the ship an ominous calm had fallen. Swiftly they\nsped down the corridor, and had almost reached the open air, when\nsuddenly there was a dull rumble behind them, and they were caught on a\nwave of pressure that hurled them along at terrific speed. In a flash\nthey sped into the open air, the great tunnel with its thick walls and\nflared opening acting like a gigantic blunderbus, with the ship as its\nbullet. Arcot made no attempt to slow down the little craft, but pressed\nhis foot heavily on the vertical accelerator. The ship rocketed up with\nterrific speed, and the acceleration pinned the men down to their seats\nwith tripled weight.\n\nAnxiously they watched the huge invader as they sped away from it. At\nArcot's direction Morey signaled the other groups of scientists to get\nout of danger with all speed, warning of the impending blow-up. As the\nmoments sped by the tension mounted. Arcot stared fixedly into the\nscreen before him, keeping the giant space ship in focus. As they sped\nmile upon miles away from it, he began to relax a bit.\n\nNot a word was spoken as they watched and waited. Actually, very little\ntime passed before the explosion, but to the watchers the seconds\ndragged endlessly. Then at twenty-seven miles, the screen flared into a\nsheet of blinding white radiance. There was a timeless instant--then a\ntremendous wave of sound, a roaring, stunning concussion smote the ship,\nshaking it with unrestrained fury--to cease as abruptly as it came.\n\nImmediately they realized the reason. They were rushing away from the\nexplosion faster than the sound it made, hence could not hear it. After\nthe first intolerable flash, details became visible. The great ship\nseemed to leap into countless tremendous fragments, each rushing away\nfrom the point of the blow-up. They did not go far; the force was not\nsustained long enough, nor was it great enough to overcome the inertia\nof so vast a mass for more than moments. Huge masses rained to earth, to\nbury themselves in the soil.\n\nThere came a momentary lull. Then suddenly, from the mass which\nevidently held the wrecked engine room, there shot out a beam of intense\nwhite light that swept around in a wide, erratic arc. Whatever it\ntouched fused instantly into a brilliantly glowing mass of liquid\nincandescence. The field itself, fragments of the wreckage, fused and\nmingled under its fury. The beam began to swing, faster and faster, as\nthe support that was holding it melted; then abruptly it turned upon\nitself. There came a sudden blast of brilliance to rival that of the\nsun--and the entire region became a molten lake. Eyes streaming,\ntemporarily blinded, the men turned away from the screen.\n\n\"That,\" said Arcot ruefully, \"is that! It seems that our visitors don't\nwant to leave any of their secrets lying around for us to investigate.\nI've an idea that all the other wrecks will go like this one did.\" He\nscowled. \"You know, we really didn't learn much. Guess we'd better call\nthe headquarters ship and ask for further instructions. Will you attend\nto it, Lieutenant Greer?\"\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nSwiftly Arcot's sleek cruiser sped toward New York and the Arcot\nLaboratories. They had halted briefly at the headquarters ship of the\nEarth-Venus forces to report on their experience; and alone again, the\nthree scientists were on their way home.\n\nWith their course set, Arcot spoke to the others. \"Well, fellows, what\nare your opinions on--what we've seen? Wade, you're a chemist--tell us\nwhat you think of the explosion of the ship, and of the strange color of\nour molecular ray in their air.\"\n\nWade shook his head doubtfully. \"I've been trying to figure it out, and\nI can't quite believe my results. Still, I can't see any other\nexplanation. That reddish glow looked like hydrogen ions in the air. The\natmosphere was certainly combustible when it met ours, which makes it\nimpossible for me to believe that their air contained any noticeable\namount of oxygen, for anything above twenty per cent oxygen and the rest\nhydrogen would be violently explosive. Apparently the gas had to mix\nliberally with our air to reach that proportion. That it didn't explode\nwhen ionized, showed the absence of hydro-oxygen mixture.\n\n\"All the observed facts except one seem to point to an atmosphere\ncomposed largely of hydrogen. That one--there are beings living in it! I\ncan understand how the Venerians might adapt to a different climate, but\nI can't see how anything approaching human life can live in an\natmosphere like that.\"\n\nArcot nodded. \"I have come to similar conclusions. But I don't see too\nmuch objection to the thought of beings living in an atmosphere of\nhydrogen. It's all a question of organic chemistry. Remember that our\nbodies are just chemical furnaces. We take in fuel and oxidize it, using\nthe heat as our source of power. The invaders live in an atmosphere of\nhydrogen. They eat oxidizing fuels, and breathe a reducing atmosphere;\nthey have the two fuel components together again, but in a way different\nfrom our method. Evidently, it's just as effective. I'm sure that's the\nsecret of the whole thing.\"\n\n\"Sounds fairly logical.\" Wade agreed. \"But now I have a question for\nyou. Where under the sun did these beings come from?\"\n\nArcot's reply came slowly. \"I've been wondering the same thing. And the\nmore I wonder, the less I believe they did come from--under our sun.\nLet's eliminate all the solar planets--we can do that at one fell swoop.\nIt's perfectly obvious that those ships are by no means the first crude\nattempts of this race to fly through space. We're dealing with an\nadvanced technology. If they have had those ships even as far away as\nPluto, we should certainly have heard from them by now.\n\n\"Hence, we've got to go out into interstellar space. You'll probably\nwant to ram some of my arguments down my throat--I know there is no star\nnear enough for the journey to be made in anything less than a couple of\ngenerations by all that's logical; and they'd freeze in the interstellar\ncold doing it. There is no _known_ star close enough--but how about\nunknowns?\"\n\n\"What have they been doing with the star?\" Morey snorted. \"Hiding it\nbehind a sun-shade?\"\n\nArcot grinned. \"Yes. A shade of old age. You know a sun can't radiate\nforever; eventually they die. And a dead sun would be quite black, I'm\nsure.\"\n\n\"And the planets that circle about them are apt to become a wee bit cool\ntoo, you know.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" said Arcot, \"and we wouldn't be able to do much about it. But\ngive these beings credit for a little higher order of intelligence. We\nsaw machines in that space ship that certainly are beyond us! They are\nundoubtedly heating their planets with the same source of energy with\nwhich they are running their ships.\n\n\"I believe I have confirmation of that statement in two things. They are\nabsolutely colorless; they don't even have an opaque white skin. Any\nliving creature exposed to the rays of a sun, which is certain to emit\nsome chemical rays, is subject to coloration as a protection against\nthose rays. The whites, who have always lived where sunlight is weakest,\nhave developed a skin only slightly opaque. The Orientals, who live in\nmore tropical countries, where less clothes and more sun is the motto,\nhave slightly darker skins. In the extreme tropics Nature has found it\nnecessary to use a regular blanket of color to stop the rays. Now\nextrapolating the other way, were there no such rays, the people would\nbecome a pigmentless race. Since most proteins are rather translucent,\nat least when wet, they would appear much as these beings do. Remember,\nthere are very few colored proteins. Hemoglobin, such as in our blood,\nand hemocyanin, like that in the blue blood of the Venerians, are\npractically unique in that respect. For hydrogen absorption, I imagine\nthe blood of these creatures contains a fair proportion of some highly\nsaturated compound, which readily takes on the element, and gives it up\nlater.\n\n\"But we can kick this around some more in the lab.\"\n\nBefore starting for New York, Arcot had convinced the officer in charge\nthat it would be wise to destroy the more complete of the invaders'\nships at once, lest one of them manage to escape. The fact that none of\nthem had any rays in operation was easily explained; they would have\nbeen destroyed by the Patrol if they had made any show of weapons. But\nthey might be getting some ready, to be used in possible escape\nattempts. The scientists were through with their preliminary\ninvestigations. And the dismembered sections would remain for study,\nanyway.\n\nThe ships had finally been rayed apart, and when the three had left,\ntheir burning atmosphere had been sending mighty tongues of flame a mile\nor more into the air. The light gas of the alien atmosphere tended to\nrise in a great globular cloud, a ball that quickly burned itself out.\nIt had not taken long for the last of the machines to disintegrate under\nthe rays. There would be no more trouble from them, at any rate!\n\nNow Morey asked Arcot if he thought that they had learned all they could\nfrom the ships; would it not have been wiser to save them, and\ninvestigate more fully later, taking a chance on stopping any sudden\nattack by surviving marauders by keeping a patrol of Air Guards there.\n\nTo which Arcot replied, \"I thought quite a bit before I suggested their\ndestruction, and I conferred for a few moments with Forsyth, who's just\nabout tops in biology and bacteriology. He said that they had by no\nmeans learned as much as they wished to, but they'd been forced to leave\nin any event. Remember that pure hydrogen, the atmosphere we were\nactually living in while on the ship, is quite as inert as pure\noxygen--when alone. But the two get very rough when mixed together. The\nlonger those ships lay there the more dangerously explosive they became.\nIf we hadn't destroyed them, they would have wrecked themselves. I still\nthink we followed the only logical course.\n\n\"Dr. Forsyth mentioned the danger of disease. There's a remote\npossibility that we might be susceptible to their germs. I don't believe\nwe would be, for our chemical constitution is so vastly different. For\ninstance, the Venerians and Terrestrians can visit each other with\nperfect freedom. The Venerians have diseases, and so do we, of course;\nbut there are things in the blood of Venerians that are absolutely\ndeadly to any Terrestrian organism. We have a similar deadly effect on\nVenerian germs. It isn't immunity--it's simply that our respective\nconstitutions are so different that we don't need immunity. Similarly,\nForsyth thinks we would be completely resistant to all diseases brought\nby the invaders. However, it's safer to remove the danger, if any,\nfirst, and check afterward.\"\n\nThe three men sped rapidly back to New York, flying nearly sixty miles\nabove the surface of the Earth, where there would be no interfering\ntraffic, till at length they were above the big city, and dropping\nswiftly in a vertical traffic lane.\n\nShortly thereafter they settled lightly in the landing cradle at the\nArcot Laboratories. Arcot's father, and Morey's, were there, anxiously\nawaiting their return. The elder Arcot had for many years held the\nreputation of being the nation's greatest physicist, but recently he had\nlost it--to his son. Morey Senior was the president and chief\nstockholder in the Transcontinental Air Lines. The Arcots, father and\nson, had turned all their inventions over to their close friends, the\nMoreys. For many years the success of the great air lines had been\ndependent in large part on the inventions of the Arcots; these new\ndiscoveries enabled them to keep one step ahead of competition, and as\nthey also made the huge transport machines for other companies, they\ndrew tremendous profits from these mechanisms. The mutual interest,\nwhich had begun as a purely financial relationship, had long since\nbecome a close personal friendship.\n\nAs Arcot stepped from his speedster, he called immediately to his\nfather, telling of their find, the light-matter plate.\n\n\"I'll need a handling machine to move it. I'll be right back.\" He ran to\nthe elevator and dropped quickly to the heavy machinery lab on the lower\nfloor. In a short time he returned with a tractor-like machine equipped\nwith a small derrick, designed to get its power from the electric mains.\nHe ran the machine over to the ship. The others looked up as they heard\nthe rumble and hum of its powerful motor. From the crane dangled a\nstrong electro-magnet.\n\n\"What's that for?\" asked Wade, pointing to the magnet. \"You don't expect\nthis to be magnetic, do you?\"\n\n\"Wait and see!\" laughed Arcot, maneuvering the handling machine into\nposition. One of the others made contact with the power line, and the\ncrane reached into the ship, lowering the magnet to the plate of\ncrystal. Then Arcot turned the power into the lifting motor. The hum\nrose swiftly in volume and pitch till the full load began to strain the\ncables. The motor whined with full power, the cables vibrating under the\ntension. The machine pulled steadily, until, to Arcot's surprise, the\nrear end of the machine rose abruptly from the floor, tipping forward.\n\n\"Well--it _was_ magnetic, but how did you know?\" asked the surprised\nWade. Since the ship was made of the Venerian metal, coronium, which was\nonly slightly magnetic, the plate was obviously the magnet's only load.\n\n\"Never mind. I'll tell you later. Get an I-beam, say about twenty feet\nlong, and see if you can't help lift that crazy mass. I think we ought\nto manage it that way.\"\n\nAnd so it proved. With two of them straddling the I-beam, the leverage\nwas great enough to pull the plate out. Running it over to the elevator,\nthey lowered the heavy mass, disconnected the cable, and rode down to\nArcot's laboratory. Again the I-beam and handling machine were brought\ninto play, and the plate was unloaded from the car. The five men\ngathered around the amazing souvenir from another world.\n\n\"I'm with Wade in wondering how you knew the plate was magnetic, son,\"\ncommented the elder Arcot. \"I can accept your explanation that the stuff\nis a kind of matter made of light, but I know you too well to think it\nwas just a lucky guess. How did you know?\"\n\n\"It really was pretty much of a guess, Dad, though there was some logic\nbehind the thought. You ought to be able to trace down the idea! How\nabout you, Morey?\" Arcot smiled at his friend.\n\n\"I've kept discreetly quiet,\" replied Morey, \"feeling that in silence I\ncould not betray my ignorance, but since you ask me, I can guess too. I\nseem to recall that light is affected by a powerful magnet, and I can\nimagine that that was the basis for your guess. It has been known for\nmany years, as far back as Clerk Maxwell, that polarized light can be\nrotated by a powerful magnet.\"\n\n\"That's it! And now we may as well go over the whole story, and tell Dad\nand your father all that happened. Perhaps in the telling, we can\nstraighten out our own ideas a bit.\"\n\nFor the next hour the three men talked, each telling his story, and\ntrying to explain the whys and wherefores of what he had seen. In the\nend all agreed on one point: if they were to fight this enemy, they\n_must_ have ships that could travel though space with speed to match\nthat of the invaders, ships with a self-contained source of power.\n\nDuring a brief lull in the conversation, Morey commented rather\nsarcastically: \"I wonder if Arcot will now kindly explain his famous\ninvisible light, or the lost star?\" He was a bit nettled by his own\nfailure to remember that a star could go black. \"I can't see what\nconnection this has with their sudden attack. If they were there, they\nmust have developed when the star was bright, and as a star requires\nmillions of years to cool down, I can't see how they could suddenly\nappear in space.\"\n\nBefore answering, Arcot reached into a drawer of his desk and pulled out\nan old blackened briar pipe. Methodically he filled it, a thoughtful\nfrown on his face; then carefully lighting it, he leaned back, puffing\nout a thin column of gray smoke.\n\n\"Those creatures must have developed on their planets before the sun\ncooled.\" He puffed slowly. \"They are, then, a race millions of years\nold--or so I believe. I can't give any scientific reason for this\nfeeling; it's merely a hunch. I just have a feeling that the invaders\nare old, older than our very planet! This little globe is just about two\nbillion years old. I feel that that race is so very ancient they may\nwell have counted the revolutions of our galaxy as, once every twenty or\nthirty million years, it swung about its center.\n\n\"When I looked at those great machines, and those comparatively little\nbeings as they handled their projectors, they seemed out of place. Why?\"\nHe shrugged. \"Again, just a hunch, an impression.\" He paused again, and\nthe slow smoke drifted upward.\n\n\"If I'm granted the premise that a black, dead star is approaching the\nSolar System, then my theorizing may seem more logical. You agree?\" The\nlisteners nodded and Arcot continued. \"Well--I had an idea--and when I\nwent downstairs for the handling machine, I called the Lunar\nObservatory.\" He couldn't quite keep a note of triumph out of his voice.\n\"Gentlemen--some of the planets have been misbehaving! The outermost\nplanets, and even some of those closer to the sun have not been moving\nas they should. A celestial body of appreciable mass _is_ approaching\nthe System; though thus far nothing has been seen of the visitor!\"\n\nA hubbub of excited comment followed this startling revelation. Arcot\nquieted them with an upraised hand. \"The only reason you and the world\nat large haven't heard about this as yet is the fact that the\nperturbation of the planets is so very slight that the astronomers\nfigured they might have made an error in calculation. They're\nrechecking now for mistakes.\n\n\"To get back to my visualization--It must have been many millions of\nyears ago that life developed on the planets of the black star, a warm\nsun then, for it was much younger. It was probably rather dim as suns go\neven its younger days. Remember, our own sun is well above average in\nbrilliance and heat radiation.\n\n\"In those long-gone ages I can imagine a race much like ours developing,\ndiffering chemically, in their atmosphere of hydrogen; but the chemical\nbody is not what makes the race, it's the thought process. They must\nhave developed, and then as their science grew, their sun waned. Dimmer\nand dimmer it became, until their planets could not maintain life\nnaturally. Then they had to heat them artificially. There is no question\nas to their source of power; they had to use the energy of matter--so\ncalled atomic energy--for no other source would be great enough to do\nwhat had to be done. It is probable that their science had developed\nthis long before their great need arose.\n\n\"With this must also have come the process of transmutation, and the\nprocess they use in driving their interstellar cruisers. I am sure those\nmachines are driven by material energy.\n\n\"But at last their star was black, a closed star, and their cold, black\nplanets must circle a hot, black sun forever! They were trapped for\neternity unless they found a way to escape to some other stellar system.\nThey could not travel as fast as light, and they could escape only if\nthey found some near-by solar system. Their star was dead--black. Let's\ncall it Nigra--the Black One--since like every other star it should have\na name. Any objection?\"\n\nThere was none, so Arcot continued:\n\n\"Now we come to an impossibly rare coincidence. That two suns in their\nmotion should approach each other is beyond the point of logic. That\nboth suns have a retinue of planets approaches the height of the\nridiculous. Yet that is what is happening right now. And the Nigrans--if\nthat's the correct term--have every intention of taking advantage of\nthe coincidence. Since our sun has been visible to them for a long, long\ntime, and the approaching proximity of the suns evident, they had lots\nof time to prepare.\n\n\"I believe this expedition was just an exploratory one; and if they can\nsend such huge machines and so many of them, for mere exploration, I'm\nsure they must have quite a fleet to fight with.\n\n\"We know little about their weapons. They have that death ray, but it's\nnot quite as deadly as we might have feared, solely because our ships\ncould outmaneuver them. Next time, logically, they'll bring with them a\nfleet of little ships, carried in the bellies of those giants, and\nthey'll be a real enemy. We'll have to anticipate their moves and build\nto circumvent them.\n\n\"As for their ray, I believe I have an idea how it works. You're all\nfamiliar with the catalytic effects of light. Hydrogen and chlorine will\nstand very peacefully in the same jar for a long time, but let a strong\nlight fall on them, and they combine with terrific violence. This is the\ncatalytic effect of a vibration, a wave motion. Then there is such a\nthing as negative catalysis. In a certain reaction, if a third element\nor compound is introduced, all reaction is stopped. I believe that's the\nprinciple of the Nigran death ray; it's a catalyst that simply stops the\nchemical reactions of a living body, and these are so delicately\nbalanced that the least resistance will upset them.\"\n\nArcot halted, and sat puffing furiously for a moment. During his\ndiscourse the pipe had died to an ember; with vigorous puffing he tried\nto restore it. At last he had it going and continued.\n\n\"What other weapons they have we cannot say. The secret of invisibility\nmust be very old to them. But we'll guard against the possibility by\nequipping our ships against it. The only reason the patrol ships aren't\nequipped already is that invisibility is useless with modern criminals;\nthey all know the secret and how to fight it.\"\n\nMorey interrupted with a question.\n\n\"Arcot, it's obvious that we have to get out into space to meet the\nenemy--and we'll have to have freedom of movement there. How are we\ngoing to do it? I was wondering if we could use Wade's system of storing\nthe atomic hydrogen in solution. That yields about 100,000 calories for\nevery two grams, and since this is a method of storing heat energy, and\nyour molecular motion director is a method of converting heat into\nmechanical work with 100 per cent efficiency, why not use that? All we\nneed, really, is a method of storing heat energy for use while we're in\nspace.\"\n\nArcot exhaled slowly before answering, watching the column of smoke\nvanish into the air.\n\n\"I thought of that, and I've been trying to think of other, and if\npossible, better, cheaper, and quicker ways of getting the necessary\npower.\n\n\"Let's eliminate the known sources one by one. The usual ones, the ones\nmen have been using for centuries, go out at once. The atomic hydrogen\nreaction stores more energy per gram than any other chemical reaction\nknown. Such things as the storage battery, the electro-static condenser,\nthe induction coil, or plain heat storage, are worthless to us. The only\nother method of storing energy we know of is the method used by the\nKaxorians in driving their huge planes.\n\n\"They use condensed light-energy. This is efficient to the ultimate\nmaximum, something no other method can hope to attain. Yet they need\nhuge reservoirs to store it. The result is still ineffective for our\npurpose; we want something we can put in a small space; we want to\ncondense the light still further. That will be the ideal form of energy\nstorage, for then we will be able to release it directly as a heat ray,\nand so use it with utmost efficiency. I think we can absorb the released\nenergy in the usual cavity radiator.\"\n\nA queer little smile appeared on Arcot's face. \"Remember--what we want\nis light in a more condensed form, a form that is naturally stable, and\nthat does not need to be held in a bound state, but actually requires\nurging to bring about the release of energy. For example--\"\n\nA shout from Wade interrupted him. \"That's really rare! _Whoo_--I have\nto hand it to you! That takes all the prizes!\" He laughed delightedly.\nIn puzzled wonder Morey and the two older men looked at him, and at\nArcot who was grinning broadly now.\n\n\"Well, I suppose it must be funny,\" Morey began, then hesitated. \"Oh--I\nsee--say, that _is_ good!\" He turned to his father. \"I see now what he's\nbeen driving at. It's been right here under our noses all the time.\n\n\"The light-matter windows we found in the wrecked enemy ships contain\nenough bound light-energy to run all the planes we could make in the\nnext ten years! We're going to have the enemy supply us with power we\ncan't get in any other way. I can't decide, Arcot, whether you deserve a\nprize for ingenuity, or whether we should receive booby-prizes for our\nstupidity.\"\n\nArcot Senior smiled at first, then looked dubiously at his son.\n\n\"There's definitely plenty of the right kind of energy stored there--but\nas you suggested, the energy will need encouragement to break free. Any\nideas?\"\n\n\"A couple. I don't know how they'll work, of course; but we can try.\"\nArcot puffed at his pipe, serious now as he thought of the problems\nahead.\n\nWade interposed a question. \"How do you suppose they condense that light\nenergy in the first place, and, their sun being dead, whence all the\nlight? Back to the atom, I suppose.\"\n\n\"You know as much as I do, of course, but I'm sure they must break up\nmatter for its energy. As for the condensation problem, I think I have a\npossible solution of that too--it's the key to the problem of release.\nThere's a lot we don't know now--but we'll have a bigger store of\nknowledge before this war is over--if we have anything at all!\" he added\ngrimly. \"It's possible that man may lose knowledge, life, his planets\nand sun--but there's still plenty of hope. We're not finished yet.\"\n\n\"How do you think they got their energy loose?\" asked\n\nWade. \"Do you think those big blocks of what appeared to be silver were\ninvolved in the energy release?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do. Those blocks were probably designed to carry away the power\nonce it was released. How the release was accomplished, though, I don't\nknow. They couldn't use material apparatus to start their release of\nmaterial energy; the material of the apparatus might 'catch fire' too.\nThey had to have the disintegrating matter held apart from all other\nmatter. This was quite impossible, if you are going to get the energy\naway by any method other than by the use of fields of force. I don't\nthink that is the method. My guess is that a terrific current of\nelectricity would accomplish it if anything would.\n\n\"How then are we going to get the current to it? The wires will be\nsubject to the same currents. Whatever they do to the matter involved,\nthe currents will do to the apparatus--except in one case. If that\napparatus is made of _some other kind of matter_, then it wouldn't be\naffected. The solution is obvious. Use some of the light-matter. What\nwill destroy light-matter, won't destroy electricity-matter, and what\nwill destroy electricity-matter, won't disturb light-matter.\n\n\"Do you remember the platform of light-metal, clear as crystal? It must\nhave been an insulating platform. What we started as our assumptions in\nthe case of the light-metal, we can now carry further. We said that\nelectricity-metals carried electricity, so light-metals would carry or\nconduct light. Now we know that there is no substance which is\ntransparent to light, that will carry electricity by metallic\nconduction. I mean, of course, that there is no substance transparent to\nlight, and at the same time capable of carrying electricity by\nelectronic transmission. True, we have things like NaCl solutions in\nordinary H_{2}O which will carry electricity, but here it's ionic\nconduction. Even glass will carry electricity very well when hot; when\nred hot, glass will carry enough electricity to melt it very quickly.\nBut again, glass is not a solid, but a viscous liquid, and it is again\ncarried by ionic conduction. Iron, copper, sodium, silver, lead--all\nmetals carry the current by means of electron drift through the solid\nmaterial. In such cases we can see that no transparent substance\nconducts electricity.\n\n\"Similarly, the reverse is true. No substance capable of carrying\nelectricity by metallic conduction is transparent. All are opaque, if in\nany thickness. Of course, gold is transparent when in leaf form--but\nwhen it's that thin it won't conduct very much! The peculiar condition\nwe reach in the case of the invisible ship is different. There the\neffects are brought about by the high frequency impressed. But you get\nmy point.\n\n\"Do you remember those wires that we saw leading to that little box of\nthe reflecting material? So perfectly reflecting it was that we didn't\nsee it. We only saw where it must be; we saw the light it reflected.\nThat was no doubt light-matter, a non-metal, and as such, non-conductive\nto light. Like sulphur, an electric non-metal, it reflected the base of\nwhich it was formed. Sulphur reflects the base of which it was formed.\nSulphur reflects electricity and--in the crystalline form--passes light.\nThis light-non-metal did the same sort of thing; it reflected light and\npassed electricity. It was a conductor.\n\n\"Now we have the things we need, the matter to disintegrate, and the\nmatter to hold the disintegrating material in. We have two different\ntypes of matter. The rest is obvious--but decidedly not easy. They have\ndone it, though; and after the war is over, there should be many of\ntheir machines drifting about in space waiting to give up their\nsecrets.\"\n\nArcot Senior clapped his son on the back. \"A fair foundation on which to\nstart, anyway. But I think it's time now that you got working on your\nproblem; and since I'm officially retired, I'm going downstairs. You\nknow I'm working in my lab on a method to increase the range and power\nof your projector for the molecular motion field. Young Norris is\nhelping me, and he really has ideas. I'll show you our math later.\"\n\nThe party broke up, the three younger men staying in their own labs, the\nolder men leaving.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nThe three immediately set to work. At Arcot's suggestion, Wade and Morey\nattacked the plate of crystal in an attempt to tear off a small piece,\non which they might work. Arcot himself went into the televisophone room\nand put through a second call to the Tychos Observatory, the great\nobservatory that had so recently been established on the frigid surface\nof the Moon. The huge mirror, twenty feet in diameter, allowed an\nimmense magnification, and stellar observations were greatly\nfacilitated, for no one bothered them, and the \"seeing\" was always\nperfect.\n\nHowever, the great distance was rather a handicap to the ordinary\ntelevisophone stations, and all calls put through to the astronomers had\nto be made through the powerful sending station in St. Louis, where all\ninterplanetary messages were sent and received, while that side of the\nEarth was facing the station; and from Constantinople, when that city\nfaced the satellite. These stations could bridge the distance readily\nand clearly.\n\nFor several minutes Arcot waited while connections were being made with\nthe Moon; then for many more minutes he talked earnestly with the\nobserver in this distant station, and at last satisfied, he hung up.\n\nHe had outlined his ideas concerning the black star, based upon the\nperturbation of the planets; then he had asked them to investigate the\npossibilities, and see if they could find any blotting out of stars by a\nlightless mass.\n\nFinally he returned to Morey and Wade who had been working on the\ncrystal plate. Wade had an expression of exasperation on his face, and\nMorey was grinning broadly.\n\n\"Hello, Arcot--you missed all the fun! You should have seen Wade's\nstruggle with that plate!\" The plate, during his absence, had been\ntwisted and bent, showing that it had undergone some terrific stresses.\nNow Wade began to make a series of highly forceful comments about the\nproperties of the plate in language that was not exactly scientific. It\nhad value, though, in that it seemed to relieve his pent-up wrath.\n\n\"Why, Wade, you don't seem to like that stuff. Maybe the difficulty lies\nin your treatment, rather than in the material itself. What have you\ntried?\"\n\n\"Everything! I took a coronium hack saw that will eat through molybdenum\nsteel like so much cheese, and it just wore its teeth off. I tried some\nof those diamond rotary saws you have, attached to an electric motor,\nand it wore out the diamonds. That got my goat, so I tried using a\nlittle force. I put it in the tension testing machine, and clamped\nit--the clamp was good for 10,000,000 pounds--but it began to bend, so I\nhad to quit. Then Morey held it with a molecular beam, and I tried\ntwisting it. Believe me, it gave me real pleasure to see that thing\nyield under the pressure. But it's not brittle; it merely bends.\n\n\"And I can't cut it, or even get some shavings off the darned thing. You\nsaid you wanted to make a Jolly balance determination of the specific\ngravity, but the stuff is so dense you'd need only a tiny scrap--and I\ncan't break it loose!\" Wade looked at the plate in thorough disgust.\n\nArcot smiled sympathetically; he could understand his feelings, for the\nstuff certainly was stubborn. \"I'm sorry I didn't warn you fellows about\nwhat you'd run into, but I was so anxious to get that call through to\nthe Moon that I forgot to tell you how I expected to make it workable.\nNow, Wade, if you'll get another of those diamond-tooth rotary saws,\nI'll get something that may help. Put the saw on the air motor. Use the\none made of coronium.\"\n\nWade looked after the rapidly disappearing Arcot with raised eyebrows,\nthen, scratching his head, he turned and did as Arcot had asked.\n\nArcot returned in about five minutes with a small handling machine, and\na huge magnet. It must have weighed nearly half a ton. This he quickly\nconnected to the heavy duty power lines of the lab. Now, running the\nhandling machine into position, he quickly hoisted the bent and twisted\nplate to the poles of the magnet, with the aid of the derrick. Then\nbacking the handling machine out of the way, he returned briskly to his\nwaiting associates.\n\n\"Now we'll see what we will see!\" With a confident smile Arcot switched\non the current of the big magnet. At once a terrific magnetic flux was\nset up through the light-metal. He took the little compressed-air saw,\nand applied it to the crystal plate. The smooth hiss of the air deepened\nto a harsh whine as the load came on it, then the saw made contact with\nthe refractory plate.\n\nUnbelievingly Wade saw the little diamond-edge saw bite its way slowly\nbut steadily into the plate. In a moment it had cut off a little corner\nof the light-matter, and this fell with a heavy thud to the magnet pole,\ndrawn down by the attraction of the magnet and by gravity.\n\nShutting off the magnet, Arcot picked up a pair of pliers and gripped\nthe little fragment.\n\n\"Whew--light-metal certainly isn't light metal! I'll bet this little\nscrap weights ten pounds! We'll have to reduce it considerably before we\ncan use it. But that shouldn't be too difficult.\"\n\nBy using the magnet and several large diamond faceplates they were able\nto work the tough material down to a thin sheet; then with a heavy\npress, they cut some very small fragments, and with these, determined\nthe specific gravity.\n\n\"Arcot,\" Wade asked finally, \"just how does the magnet make that stuff\ntractable? I'm not physicist enough to figure out what takes place\ninside the material.\"\n\n\"Magnetism worked as it did,\" Arcot explained, \"because in this\nlight-matter every photon is affected by the magnetism, and every photon\nis given a new motion. That stuff can be made to go with the speed of\nlight, you know. It's the only solid that could be so affected. This\nstuff should be able, with the aid of a molecular motion beam, which\nwill make all the photons move in parallel paths, to move at the full\nspeed of each photon--186,000 miles a second. The tremendous speed of\nthese individual photons is what makes the material so hard. Their\nkinetic impulse is rather considerable! It's the kinetic blow that the\nmolecules of a metal give that keeps other metal from penetrating it.\nThis simply gives such powerful impulse that even diamonds wouldn't cut\nit.\n\n\"You know that an iron saw will cut platinum readily, yet if both are\nheated to say, 1600 degrees, the iron is a liquid, and the platinum very\nsoft--but now the platinum cuts through the iron!\n\n\"Heat probably won't have any effect on this stuff, but the action of\nthe magnet on the individual photons corresponds to the effect of the\nheat on the individual atoms and molecules. The mass is softened, and we\ncan work it. At least, that's the way I figure it out.\n\n\"But now, Wade, I wish you'd see if you can determine the density of the\nstuff. You're more used to those determinations and that type of\nmanipulation than we are. When you get through, we may be able to show\nyou some interesting results ourselves!\"\n\nWade picked up a tiny chip of the light-metal and headed for his own\nlaboratory. Here he set up his Jolly balance, and began to work on the\nfragment. His results were so amazing that he checked and rechecked his\nwork, but always with the same answer. Finally he returned to the main\nlab where Arcot and Morey were busy at the construction of a large and\ncomplicated electro-static apparatus.\n\n\"What did you find?\" called out Arcot, as he saw Wade reenter the room.\n\"Hold your report a second and give us a hand here, will you? I have a\nlaboratory scale apparatus of the type the Kaxorians used in the storage\nof light. They've known, ever since they began working with them, that\ntheir machines would release the energy with more than normal violence,\nif certain changes were made in them. That is, the light condenser, the\ndevice that stored the photons so close to each other, would also serve\nto urge them apart. I've made the necessary changes, and now I'm trying\nto set up the apparatus to work on solid light-matter. It was developed\nfor gaseous material, and it's a rather tricky thing to change it over.\nBut I think we've almost got it.\n\n\"Wade, will you connect that to the high frequency oscillator\nthere--no--through that counterbalanced condenser. We may have to change\nthe oscillator frequency quite a bit, but a variable condenser will do\nthat.\n\n\"Now, what results did you get?\"\n\nWade shook his head doubtfully. \"We all know it's amazing stuff--and of\ncourse, it must be heavy--but still--well, anyway, I got a density of\n103.5!\"\n\n\"Whewww--103.5! Lord! That's almost five times as heavy as the heaviest\nmetal hitherto known. There's about half a cubic foot of the material;\nthat would mean about 4000 pounds for the whole mass, or two tons. No\nwonder we couldn't lift the plate!\"\n\nThey stopped their work on the Kaxorian apparatus to discuss the amazing\nresults of the density test, but now they fell to again, rapidly\nassembling the device, for each was a trained experimenter. With all but\nthe final details completed, Arcot stood back and surveyed their\nhandiwork.\n\n\"I think we'll have enough urge to cause disintegration right here,\" he\nsaid, \"but I want to make sure, and so, before we set up the case over\nit, I think we may as well put that big magnet in place, and have it\nthere to help in the work of disintegration, if need be.\"\n\nAt last the complete apparatus was set up, and the tiny bit of\nlight-matter they were to work on was placed on the table of a powerful\nAtchinson projector microscope, the field of view being in the exact\ncenter of the field of both the magnet and the coil. Carefully, then,\nstep by step, Arcot, Morey and Wade went over their work, checking and\nrechecking.\n\n\"Well, we're ready,\" said Arcot finally, as he placed the projector\nscreen in position and dimmed the lights in the room. A touch of the\nswitch, and the projection screen was illuminated with the greatly\nenlarged image of the tiny scrap of light-metal.\n\nWith his hand on the switch, Arcot spoke to the other two. \"I won't say\nthere's _no_ danger, since we haven't done this before; and if all the\nenergy should be released at once, it'll blow the top out of the\nbuilding. But I'm reasonably sure that it will work safely. Any\nobjections?\"\n\nWade shook his head, and Morey said: \"I can't see any flaws in our\nwork.\"\n\nArcot nodded, and unconsciously tensing, he closed the switch. This put\nthe powerful Arcot oscillator tubes into action, and the power was ready\nfor application.\n\nSlowly he closed the rheostat and put the power into the coil. The\nlittle sliver of metal on the slide seemed to throb a bit, and its\noutline grew hazy; but at last, with full power on, the release was so\nslow as to be imperceptible.\n\n\"Guess we need the magnet after all; I'll put it on this time.\"\n\nHe opened the coil circuit and closed the magnet circuit at half\nvoltage, then again he increased the current through the rheostat. This\ntime the plate throbbed quite violently, it took the appearance of a bit\nof iodine. Dense vapors began pouring from it, and instantly those\nvapors became a blindingly brilliant flood of light. Arcot had snapped\nopen the switch the moment he saw this display start, and it had had\nlittle time to act, for the instant the circuit was opened, it subsided.\nBut even in that brief time, the light aluminum screen had suddenly\nbecome limp and slumped down, molten! The room was unbearably hot, and\nthe men were half blinded by the intensity of the light.\n\n\"It works!\" yelled Wade. \"It works! That sure was hot, too--it's\nroasting in here.\" He flung open a window. \"Let's have some air.\"\n\nArcot and Morey gripped hands with a broad grin. That display meant that\nEarth and Venus would have space ships with which to fight space ships.\nReason enough for their joy.\n\nThough they had made an unusual amount of progress already, there was\nstill a great deal of development work to be done. Fuller was needed,\nArcot decided, so he called the elder Morey and requested his services\nif he could be spared from his present work. He could, and would arrive\nlater that day.\n\nWhen Fuller appeared about mid-afternoon, he found the three friends\nalready at work on the development of a more compact apparatus than the\nmakeshift hookup used in making that first release mechanism.\n\n\"And so you can see,\" said Arcot as he finished his summary of their\nwork to that point, \"we still have quite a job ahead of us. I'm now\ntrying to find some data for you to work on, but I can tell you this:\nWe'll need a ship that has plenty of strength and plenty of speed. There\nwill be the usual power plant, of course; the generators, the power-tube\nboard, and the electro-magnetic relays for the regular molecular motion\ncontrols. Then, in addition, we must have controls for the ray\nprojector, though that must wait a while, for Dad is working on a method\nof doubling our range.... Oh yes, the driving units will be inside the\nship now, for all our power will come from the energy of the\nlight-matter.\"\n\nThey spent the next hour in discussing the manifold details involved in\nthe design of their space ship: the mechanism involved in transferring\nthe light-energy to the drivers; a means of warming the ship in\ninterstellar space; a main horizontal drive for forward and backward\nmotion as well as braking; three smaller vertical power units to give\nthem freedom of direction in climb or descent; other smaller horizontal\npower units for turning and moving sideways.\n\nThe ships, they decided, must be capable of six or seven thousand miles\na second. They would need three types of ships: a small single-man\nspeedster, without bunk or living quarters, simply a little power plant\nand weapon. Designed for speed and mobility, it would be very hard to\nhit, and because of its own offensive power would be dangerous to the\nenemy. They would need a fleet of mother ships--ships that would hold\nboth the speedsters and their pilots--say thirty to a cruiser. There\nwould also be some ten-man scouts, operating in the same manner as the\nlarger cruisers, but with a smaller fleet of speedsters dependent on\nthem.\n\n\"For defense,\" Arcot concluded, \"we'll have to depend on armor as heavy\nas we can make and still remain within the bounds of practical\nconstruction. I don't believe we'll be able to build up enough mass to\ninsulate against their negative catalysis ray. We'll have to depend on\nmobility and offense.\n\n\"But now let's get back to work. I think, Fuller, that you might call in\nthe engineers of all the big aircraft and machine tool manufacturers and\nfabricators, and have them ready to start work at once when the plans\nare finally drawn up. You'd better get in touch with the Venerian\nproducers, too. Those new works in Sorthol, Kaxor, will certainly be\nable to help a lot.\n\n\"I suppose the Interplanetary Patrol men will have something to say, so\nthey better be called in. Likewise the Venerian Council. Morey, maybe\nyour dad can handle some of this.\"\n\nAs one they arose and set to work on their respective tasks--the\nplanning and building of the Earth-Venus war fleet.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nDespite their utmost endeavor and the hard work of the industrial might\nof two worlds, it was nearly six weeks before the fleet had grown to a\nthing of importance. The tests to which they subjected the tiny\nspeedsters had been more than satisfactory. They behaved wonderfully,\nshooting about at terrific speed, and with all the acceleration a pilot\ncould stand. These speedsters were literally piloted projectiles, and\ntheir amazing mobility made them a powerful arm of offense.\n\nThere came into being a special corp dubbed, oddly enough, the \"Rocket\nSquad\", a group of men who could stand plenty of \"G's\". This \"Rocket\nSquad\" was composed solely of Terrestrians, for they were accustomed to\nthe gravity of Earth and could stand greater acceleration strains than\ncould the Venerians. The pick of the Air Patrol formed the nucleus of\nthis new military organization; and in short order, so great is the\nappeal of the new and novel, the cream of the young men of the planet\nwere competing for a place among the Rocketeers.\n\nEach ship, both speedster and mother craft, was equipped with an\ninvisibility locator, a sensitive short-wave directional receiver, that\nwould permit the operator to direct his rays at invisible targets. The\nships themselves could not be made invisible, since they depended in\ntheir very principle on the absorption of light-energy. If the walls of\nevery part of the ship were perfectly transparent, they could absorb no\nenergy at all, and they would still be plainly visible--even more so\nthan before! They must remain visible, but they could also force the\nenemy to remain visible.\n\nEach ten-man ship carried an old-fashioned cannon that was equipped to\nhurl cannisters carrying the luminous paint. They decided that these\nwould have advantages, even if the invaders did not use invisibility,\nfor in space a ship is visible only because it reflects or emits light.\nFor this reason the ships were not equipped with any portholes except in\nthe pilot room and at the observation posts. No light could escape. To\nreduce the reflection to the absolute minimum, the ships had each been\npainted with a 99% absorptive black. In space they would be exceedingly\ndifficult targets.\n\nThe heating effect of the sun on the black pigment when near the great\nstar was rather disagreeably intense, and to cool the speedsters they\nhad installed molecular director power units, which absorbed the heat\nand used the energy to drive the ship. Heaters offset the radiation loss\nof the black surface when too far from the sun.\n\nEach of the speedsters was equipped with a small machine-gun shooting\nluminous paint bullets. One of these, landing on another craft, made it\nvisible for at least two hours, and since they could cover an area of\nabout thirty feet, they were decidedly effective.\n\nIt was found that ray practice was rather complicated. The government\nhad ranges set up in great mountain districts away from any valuable\nproperty, but they soon found that spatial warplay could not be carried\non on Earth. The rays very quickly demolished the targets, and in a\nshort time made good progress toward demolishing the mountains as well.\nThe problem was solved by using the barren surface of the moon and the\nasteroid belt beyond Mars as a proving ground.\n\nThe ships were sent out in squadrons as fast as they could be finished\nand the men could be brought together and trained. They were\nestablishing a great shield of ships across all that section of the\nsystem whence the Nigrans had appeared, and they hoped to intercept the\nnext attack before it reached Earth, for they were certain the next\nattack would be in full force.\n\nArcot had gone to the conference held on Venus with the other men who\nhad investigated the great wrecks, and each scientist had related his\nview of things and had offered suggestions. Arcot's idea of the black\nstar was not very favorably received. As he later told Wade and Morey,\nwho had not gone, there was good reason for their objection to his idea.\nThough the scientists were willing to admit that the invaders must have\ncome from a great distance, and they agreed that they lived in an\natmosphere of hydrogen, and judging from their pale skins, that they\nwere not used to the rays of a sun, they still insisted on the theory of\nan outer planet of Sol.\n\n\"You remember,\" explained Arcot, \"several years ago there was\nconsiderable discussion about the existence of a planet still further\nout from the sun than Pluto. It is well known that there are a number of\nirregularities in the orbits of Neptune and Pluto that can't be caused\nby known planets, and an outer planet could have the necessary mass and\norbit to account for them.\n\n\"This attack from outer space was immediately taken as proof of that\ntheory, and it was very easily supported, too. My one good point that\nstood for any length of time under their attacks was the fact that those\nships weren't developed in a year, nor a century, and that the chemical\nconstitution of the men was so different. There were no new elements\ndiscovered, except the light-matter, but they are rather wondering about\nthe great difference of earthly chemical constitution and the\nconstitution of these invaders.\n\n\"They had one argument that was just about enough to throw mine out,\nthough they pointed to the odds against the thing happening. You know,\nof course, how planets are formed? They are the results of tidal action\non two passing suns.\n\n\"You can imagine two mighty stars careening through space and then\ndrawing slowly nearer, till at last they come within a few billion miles\nof each other, and their gigantic masses reach out and bind them with a\nmighty chain of gravity. Their titanic masses swing about each other,\neach trying to pull free, and continue its path about the center of the\ngalactic system. But as their huge bulks come nearer, the chains that\nbind them become stronger and stronger, and the tremendous pull of the\none gargantuan fire ball on the other raises titanic tides of flame.\nGreat streamers of gas shoot out, and all the space about is lighted by\nthe flaming suns. The pull of gravity becomes more and more intense, and\nas the one circles the other, the tide is pulled up, and the mighty ball\nof fire, which, for all its existence has been practically motionless as\nfar as rotation goes, begins to acquire a greater and greater rotational\nspeed as the tidal drag urges it on. The flames begin to reach higher\nand higher, and the tides, now urged from the sun by centrifugal force,\nrise into an ever greater crest, and as the swinging suns struggle to\nbreak loose, the flaming gas is pulled up and up, and becomes a mighty\ncolumn of fire, a column that reaches out across three--four--a dozen\nmillions of miles of space and joins the two stars at last, as\nstalactites and stalagmites grow together. A flaming tie of matter joins\nthem, two titanic suns, and a mighty rope of fire binds them, while far\nmightier chains of gravity hold them together.\n\n\"But now their original velocity reasserts itself, and having spiraled\nabout each other for who can say how long--a year--a million years\nseems more probable--but still only an instant in the life of a\nstar--they begin to draw apart, and the flaming column is stretched out,\nand ever thinner it grows, and the two stars at last separate. But now\nthe gas will never fall back into the sun. Like some giant flaming cigar\nit reaches out into space and it will stay thus, for it has been set in\nrotation about the sun at such a speed as is needed to form an orbit.\nThe giant mass of gas is, however, too cool to continue to develop\nenergy from matter, for it was only the surface of the sun, and cool. As\nit cools still further, there appear in it definite condensations, and\nthe beginnings of the planets are there. The great filament that\nstretched from the sun to sun was cigar-shaped, and so the matter is\nmore plentiful toward the center, and larger planets develop. Thus\nJupiter and Saturn are far larger than any of the others. The two ends\nare tapering, thus Earth is larger than Venus, which is larger than\nMercury, and Uranus and Neptune are both smaller than Saturn, Pluto\nbeing smaller than either.\n\n\"Mars and the asteroids are hard to explain. Perhaps it is easier to\nunderstand when we remember that the planets thus formed must\nnecessarily have been rotating in eccentric orbits when they were first\nborn, and these planets came too near the sun while gaseous, or nearly\nso, and Mars lost much of its matter, while the other, which now exists\nonly as the asteroids, broke up.\n\n\"But now that other flaming star has retired, wandering on through\nspace. The star has left its traces, for behind it there are planets\nwhere none existed before. But remember that it, too, must have planets\nnow.\n\n\"All this happened some 2,000 million years ago.\n\n\"But in order that it might happen, it requires that two stars pass\nwithin the relatively short distance of a few billion miles of each\nother. Space is not overcrowded with matter, you know. The density of\nthe stars has been compared with twenty tennis balls roaming about\n8,000-mile sphere that the Earth fills up--twenty tennis balls in some\n270 billion cubic miles of space. Now imagine two of those tennis\nballs--with plenty of room to wander in--passing within a few yards of\neach other. The chances are about as good as the chances of two stars\npassing close enough to make planets.\n\n\"Now let us consider another possibility.\n\n\"The Black Star, as I told you, has planets. That means that it must\nhave thus passed close to another star. Now we have it coming close to\nanother sun that has been similarly afflicted. The chances of that\nhappening are inconceivably small. It is one chance in billions that the\nplanets will form. Two stars must pass close to each other, when they\nhave all space to wander about in. Then those afflicted stars separate,\nand one of them passes close by a new star, which has thus been\nsimilarly afflicted with that one chance in billions--well, that is then\na chance in billions of billions.\n\n\"So my theory was called impossible. I don't know but what it is.\nBesides, I thought of an argument the other men didn't throw at me. I'm\nsurprised they didn't, too--the explanation of the strange chemical\nconstitution of these men of a solar system planet would not be so\nimpossible. It is quite possible that they live on a planet revolving\nabout the sun which is, nevertheless, a planet of another star. It is\nquite conceivable to me that the chemical constitution of Neptune and\nPluto will be found to be quite different from that of the rest of our\nplanets. The two filaments drawn out from the suns may not have mingled,\nthough I think they did, but it is quite conceivable that, just before\nparting, our sun tore one planet, or even two or three, from the other\nstar.\n\n\"And that would explain these strange beings.\n\n\"My other ideas were accepted. The agreed-on plan for the release of\nenergy, and the source of the power.\" Arcot puffed on his pipe\nmeditatively for several moments, then stood up and stretched.\n\n\"Ho--I wish they'd let me go on active duty with the space fleet! A\nscientific reputation can be an awful handicap at times,\" he grinned. He\nhad been rejected very emphatically when he had tried to enlist. The\nInterplanetary governments had stated flatly that he was too important\nas a scientist to be risked as a pilot of a space ship.\n\nOn two worlds the great construction plants were humming with activity.\nCivilian production of all but the barest essentials had been put aside\nfor the duration of the emergency. Space ships were being turned out at\ntop speed, getting their fuel from the wrecks of the invaders' cruisers.\nEach ship needed only a small amount of the light-metal, for the energy\ncontent was tremendous. And those ships had been gigantic.\n\nAlready there was a fleet of speedsters and mother ships out there in\nspace, and with every passing hour others left the home planets, always\nadding to the fighting force that was to engage the attackers deep in\nspace, where no stray ships might filter through to destroy the cities\nof Earth or Venus. Assembly lines were now turning out ships so rapidly\nthat the training of their operators was the most serious problem. This\ndifficulty had finally been overcome by a very abbreviated training\ncourse in the actual manipulation of the controls on the home planets,\nand subsequent training as the squadrons raced on their outward courses.\n\nIt was soon decided that there must be another service beside that of\nthe ordinary ships. One plant was devoted to making huge interstellar\nliners. These giants, made on Venus, were nearly a quarter of a mile\nlong, and though diminutive in comparison with the giant Nigran ships,\nthey were still decidedly large. Twelve of these could be completed\nwithin the next month, it was found; and one was immediately set aside\nas an officers' headquarters ship. It was recognized that the officers\nmust be within a few hundred thousand miles of the actual engagements,\nfor decisions would have to be made without too much loss of time in the\ntransmission of reports.\n\nThe ship must not be brought too near the front lest the officers be\nendangered and the entire engagement lost for want of the organizing\ncentral headquarters. The final solution had been the huge central\ncontrol ship.\n\nThe other large vessels were to be used to carry food and supplies. They\nwere not to enter the engagement, for their huge size would make them as\nvulnerable to the tiny darting mites of space as the Nigran ships had\nbeen to the Interplanetary Patrol. The little ships could not\nconveniently stock for more than a week of engagement, then drop back to\nthese warehouses of space, and go forward again for action.\n\nThroughout the long wait the officers of the Solarian forces organized\ntheir forces to the limit of their ability, planning each move of their\nattack. Space had been marked off into a great three-dimensional map,\nand each ship carried a small replica, the planets moving as they did in\ntheir orbits. The space between the planets was divided off into\ndefinite points in a series of Cartesian co-ordinates, the sun being the\norigin, and the plane of the elliptic being the X-Y plane.\n\nThe OX line was taken pointing toward one of the brightest of the fixed\nstars that was in the plane of the elliptic. The entire solar system was\nthus marked off as had been the planets long ages before, into a system\nof three dimensional latitude and longitude. This was imperative, in\norder to assure the easy location of the point of first attack, and to\npermit the entire fleet to come into position there. A scattered guard\nwas to remain free, to avoid any false attacks and a later attack from a\npoint millions of miles distant. Earth and Venus were each equipped with\ngigantic ray projectors, mighty weapons that could destroy anything,\neven a body as large as the Moon, at a distance of ten thousand miles.\nStill, a ship might get through, and with the death ray--what fearful\ntoll might be exacted from a vast city such as Chicago--with its thirty\nmillions! Or Karos, on Venus, with its fifteen and one half millions!\n\nThe tension became greater and greater as with each passing day the\npopulace of two worlds awaited the call from the far-flung guard. The\nmain bulk of the fleet had been concentrated in the center of their\ngreat spherical shell of ships. They could only wait--and watch--and\nprepare! Hundreds of miles apart, yet near enough so that no ship\nexcept perhaps a one-man craft could pass them undetected; and behind\nthem were ships with delicate apparatus that could detect any foreign\nbody of any size whatever within a hundred thousand miles of them.\n\nThe Solar System was prepared to repel boarders from the vast sea of\nspace!\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nTaj Lamor gazed down at the tremendous field below him. In it lay close\npacked a great mass of ships, a concourse of Titans of Space,\ndreadnoughts that were soon to set out to win--not a nation, not even a\nworld, but to conquer a solar system, and to win for their owners a vast\nnew sun, a sun that would light them and heat them for long ages to\ncome.\n\nMomentarily Taj Lamor's gaze followed the retreating figure of Tordos\nGar, the Elder; a figure with stooped shoulders and bowed head. His\nquiet yet vibrant parting words still resounded in his ears:\n\n\"Taj Lamor, remember what I tell you. If you win this awful war--you\nlose. As will our race. Only if you lose will you win.\"\n\nWith a frown Taj Lamor stared down at the vast metal hulls glistening\nsoftly in the dull light of far-off stars, the single brightly beaming\nstar that was their goal, and the dim artificial lighting system. From\nthe distance came to him the tapping and humming of the working machines\nbelow as they strove to put the finishing touches to the great ships.\n\nHe raised his eyes toward the far-off horizon, where a great yellow star\nflamed brilliantly against the black velvet of space. He thought of that\nplanet where the sky had been blue--an atmosphere of such intensity that\nit colored the sky!\n\nThoughtfully he gazed at the flaming yellow point.\n\nHe had much to consider now. They had met a new race, barbarians in\nsome ways, yet they had not forgotten the lessons they had learned; they\nwere not decadent. Between his eon-old people and their new home stood\nthese strange beings, a race so young that its age could readily be\ncounted in millennia, but withal a strong, intelligent form of life. And\nto a race that had not known war for so many untold ages, it was an\nunthinkable thing that they must kill other living, intelligent beings\nin order that they might live.\n\nThey had no need of moving, Tordos Gar and many others had argued; they\ncould stay where they were forever, and never find any need for leaving\ntheir planet. This was the voice of decadence, Taj Lamor told himself;\nand he had grown to hate that voice.\n\nThere were other men, men who had gone to that other solar system, men\nwho had seen vast oceans of sparkling water, showering from their\nruffled surfaces the brilliant light of a great, hot sun. They had seen\ntowering masses of mountains that reached high into the blue sky of a\nnatural atmosphere, their mighty flanks clothed with green growth;\nnatural plants in abundance.\n\nAnd best of all, they had fought and seen action, such as no member of\ntheir race had known in untold ages. They knew Adventure and Excitement,\nand they had learned things that no member of their ancient race had\nknown for millennia. They had learned the meaning of advancement and\nchange. They had a new ardor, a new strength, a new emotion to drive\nthem, and those who would have held them back became enthusiasts\nthemselves. Enthusiasm may be contagious, but the spirit of their\ndecadence was rapidly failing before this new urge. Here was their last\nchance and they must take it; they would!\n\nThey had lost many men in that battle on the strange world, but their\nrace was intelligent; they learned quickly, the small ships had been\nvery hard targets, while their big ships were too easy to strike. They\nmust have small ships, yet they must have large ships for cargo, and for\nthe high speed driving apparatus. The small ships were not able to\naccelerate to the terrific speed needed. Once their velocity had been\nbrought up to the desired value, it was easy to maintain it with the\ninfinitely small friction of space as the only retarding force; one atom\nper cubic inch was all they must meet. This would not hold them up, but\nthe great amount of fuel and the power equipment needed to accelerate to\nthe desired speed could not be packed into the small ship. Into the vast\nholds of the huge ships the smaller ones were packed, long shining rows\nof little metal projectiles. Tiny they were, but they could dart and\ntwist and turn as swiftly as could the ships they had met on that other\nworld--tiny ships that flashed about with incredible suddenness, a\ntarget that seemed impossible to hit. These ships would be a match for\nthose flashing motes of the Yellow Sun. Now it might be that their great\ntransport and battle ships could settle down to those worlds and arrange\nthem for their own people!\n\nAnd they had discovered new weapons, too. One of their mightiest was a\nvery old apparatus, one that had been forgotten for countless ages. A\nmodel of it was in existence in some forgotten museum on a deserted\nplanet, and with it long forgotten tomes that told of its principles,\nand of its consequences. Invisibility was now at their command. It was\nan ancient weapon, but might be exceedingly effective!\n\nAnd one other. They had developed a new thing! They had not learned of\nit in books, it was their invention! They did not doubt that there were\nother machines like it in their museums, but the idea was original with\nthem. It was a beam of electrical oscillatory waves, projected with\ntremendous energy, and it would be absorbed by any conductor. They could\nmelt a ship with this!\n\nAnd thus that great field had been filled with Giants of Space! And in\neach of these thousand great warships there nestled three thousand tiny\none-man ships.\n\nHere was a sight to inspire any race!\n\nTaj Lamor watched as the last of the working machines dragged its slow\nway out of the great ships. They were finished! The men were already in\nthem, waiting to start, and now there was an enthusiasm and an activity\nthat had not been before; now the men were anxious to get that long\njourney completed and to be there, in that other system!\n\nTaj Lamor entered his little special car and shot swiftly down to the\ngiant cruisers. He stepped out of his little craft and walked over to\nthe tube conveyor ready for the trip to the nose of the great vessel.\nBehind him attendants quickly moved his car to a locked cradle berth\nbeside long rows of similar vehicles.\n\nA short while later those who were to remain on the dark planet saw the\nfirst of the monsters of space rise slowly from the ground and leap\nswiftly forward; then as methodically as though released by automatic\nmachinery, the others leaped in swift pursuit, rushing across half a\nworld to the tremendous space lock that would let them out into the\nvoid. In a long, swift column they rushed on. Then one at a time they\npassed out into the mighty sea of space. In space they quickly formed\nand set out.\n\nAs though by magic, far to the left of their flight, there suddenly\nappeared a similar flight of giant ships, and then to the right, and\nabove them, another seemed to leap out of nothingness as the ships of\nother planets came into sight. Quickly they formed a vast cone about\ntheir leader's ship, a protecting screen, yet a powerful offensive\nformation.\n\nEndlessly, it seemed, they sped on through the darkness. Then as the\nyellow star flamed brighter and brighter before them, they slowed their\nships till the small fliers could safely be released into space.\n\nLike a swarm of insects flying about giant birds of space the little\nships circled the mighty masses of the battle cruisers. So huge were\nthey, that in the combined mass of the fleet there rested sufficient\ngravitational attraction to force the little fliers to form orbits about\nthem. And so they sped on through the void, the vast conical fleet with\nits slowly circling belt of little ships. A fleet whose counterpart had\nnever entered the Solar System.\n\nIt was well beyond the orbit of Pluto that the first of the Solarian\nscouts detected the approaching invasion fleet. The tension that had\ngripped Earth and Venus and their guardian ships for so long a time\nsuddenly snapped; and like a great machine set into sudden motion, or a\nhuge boulder, balanced, given the last push that sends it spinning with\ndestructive violence down a slope, the fleet went into action.\n\nIt was merely a little scout, a ten-man cruiser, that sent in the\nmessage of attack, and then, upon receiving headquarters' permission,\nwent into action. Some of the tacticians had wanted to try to get the\nentire fleet into battle range for a surprise attack in power; but\nothers felt that this could not possibly succeed. Most important, they\ndecided, was the opportunity of learning if the invaders had any new\nweapons.\n\nThe Nigrans had no warning, for a ten-man cruiser was invisible to them,\nthough the vast bulk of their own ships stood out plainly, lighted by a\nblazing sun. No need here to make the sun stand still while the battle\nwas finished! There was no change out here in all time! The first\nintimation of attack that the Nigrans had was the sudden splitting and\ndestruction of the leading ship. Then, before they could realize what\nwas happening, thirty-five other destructive molecular motion beams were\ntearing through space to meet them! The little ten-man cruiser and its\nflight of speedsters was in action! Twenty-one great ships crumpled and\nburst noiselessly in the void, their gases belching out into space in a\ngreat shining halo of light as the sun's light struck it.\n\nUnable to see their tiny enemies, who now were striking as swiftly, as\ndesperately as possible, knowing that death was practically certain,\nhoping only to destroy a more equal number of the giants, they played\ntheir beams of death about them, taking care to miss their own ships as\nmuch as possible.\n\nAnother ship silently crumpled, and suddenly one cruiser right in the\nline of the flight was brought to a sudden halt as all its molecules\nwere reversed. The ships behind it, unable to stop so suddenly, piled\nup on it in chaotic wreckage! A vast halo of shining gas spread out\nfifty thousand miles about, blinding further the other ships, the\nradiance about them making it impossible to see their tiny enemies.\n\nNow other of the Solarian ships were coming swiftly to the attack.\nSuddenly a combination of three of the ten-man cruisers stopped another\nof the great ships instantaneously. There was another soundless crash,\nand the giant mass of wreckage that heaped suddenly up glowed dully red\nfrom the energy of impact.\n\nBut now the little ships of the invaders got into action. They had been\ndelayed by the desperate attempts of the dreadnaughts to wipe out their\nenemies with the death rays, and they could not cover the great\ndistances without some delay.\n\nWhen a battle spreads itself out through a ten-thousand mile cube of\nspace--through a thousand billion cubic miles of space--it is impossible\nto cover it instantaneously with any machine.\n\nAlready nearly a hundred and fifty of the giant liners had gone into\nmaking that colossal mass of junk in space. They must protect the\nremaining cruisers! And it was that flight of small ships that did\nprotect them. Many of the Solarians went down to death under their rays.\nThe death rays were exceedingly effective, but the heat rays were not\nable to get quite as long a range, and they were easily detected by the\ninvisibility locators, which meant certain destruction, for a molecular\nmotion ray would be there in moments, once they had been located.\n\nThe main fleet of the Solar System was already on its way, and every\nmoment drew closer to this running battle, for the great ships of the\nNigrans had, although they were entering the system cautiously, been\ngoing at a very high speed, as interplanetary speeds are measured. The\nentire battle had been a running encounter between the two forces. The\nSolarian force, invisible because of its small size, was certainly\ngetting the better of the encounter thus far, but now that the odds were\nchanging, now that the small ships had come into the fray, engaging\nthem at close range, they were not having so easy time of it.\n\nIt would be many hours before the full strength of the Solarian fleet\ncould be brought to bear on the enemy. They were not able to retire and\nawait their arrival, for they _must_ delay the Nigran fleet. If even one\nof those great ships should safely reach the two planets behind them--!\n\nBut within a half hour of the original signal, the Rocket Squad had\nthrown itself into the battle with a fervor and abandon that has given\nthat famous division a name that will last forever.\n\nThe small fliers of the Nigrans were beginning to take an appalling toll\nin the thinning ranks of the Solarians. The coming of the Rocket Squad\nwas welcome indeed! They were able to maneuver as swiftly as the enemy;\nthe speedsters were harder to spot than the Solarian ten-man and\nthirty-man boats. The Solarian speedsters were even smaller than the\ncomparable Nigran craft, and some of these did a tremendous amount of\ndamage. The heat ray was quite ineffective against the ten-man ships,\neven when working at full capacity, when produced by the small\ngenerators of the Nigran one-man boats. The cruisers could absorb the\nheat and turn it into power faster than the enemy could supply it. Beams\nfrom the monster interstellar liners were another matter, of course.\n\nBut the one-man speedsters had a truly deadly plan of attack against the\nliners. The plan was officially frowned upon because of the great risks\nthe pilots must take. They directed their boats at one of the monster\nships, all the power units on at full drive. As close to target as\npossible the man jumped from his ship, clothed, of course, in an\naltitude suit equipped with a radio transmitter and receiver.\n\nDeath rays could not stop the speedsters, and with their momentum, the\ninvaders could not make it less deadly with their heat beam, for,\nmolten, it was still effective. A projectile weighing twenty-two tons,\nmoving a hundred miles a second, can destroy anything man can lift off a\nplanet! Their very speed made it impossible to dodge them, and usually\nthey found their mark. As for the risk, if the Solarian forces were\nvictorious, the pilots could be picked up later, provided too long a\ntime had not elapsed!\n\nIn the midst of the battle, the Solarians began to wonder why the Nigran\nfleet was decreasing so rapidly--certainly they had not caused all that\ndamage! Then suddenly they found the answer. One of their ships--then\nanother--and another fell victim to a pale red ray that showed up like a\nghostly pillar of luminosity coming from nowhere and going nowhere! The\nanswer? The invaders' ships were becoming invisible! The invisibility\ndetectors were being overloaded now, and the hunt was hard, while the\nNigrans were slipping past them and silently destroying Solarian ships!\nThe molecular motion rays were quite effective on an invisible\nship--once it had been found. They were destroying the Nigrans as\nrapidly as they were being destroyed, but they were letting some of them\nslip past! The luminous paint bombs and bullets were now called into\nplay. All enemy ships were shot at with these missiles, and invisibility\nwas forestalled.\n\nAt long last the dark bulk of the main fleet approached, a scarcely\nvisible cloud of tiny darting metal ships. The battle so far had been a\npreliminary engagement. The huge ships of the Nigrans were forced to\nstop their attack, and releasing the last of the fliers, to retire to a\ndistance, protected by a screen of small ships, for they were helpless\nagainst the Solarian speedsters. Invisibility fell into disfavor, too,\nnow that there were plenty of Solarian ships, for the Nigrans were more\nconspicuous when invisible than when visible. The radio detector could\npick them out at once.\n\nThe entire Nigran fleet was beginning to reveal the disorder and\nuncertainty that arose from desperation, for they were cornered in the\nmost undesirable position possible. They were outside the Solarian\nfleet, and their ships were lighted by the glare of the sun. The\ndefenders, on the other hand, were in such a position that the enemy\ncould see only the \"night\" side of them--the shadowed side--and, as\nthere was no air to diffuse the light, they were exceedingly hard to\nfind. In the bargain, the radium paint was making life for the Nigrans a\nbrief and flitting thing!\n\nThe invaders began to pay an awful toll in this their first real\nengagement. They lacked the necessary power to cover the entire Solarian\nfleet with their death rays, and their heat weapons were of little help.\nThe power of the small ships did not count for much--and the big liners\ncould not use their weapons effectively for their small fliers must be\nbetween them and their adversary. Despite this, however, the Nigrans so\ngreatly outnumbered the Earth-Venus forces that it looked as though a\nlong and costly war lay ahead.\n\nAt last the Solarian generals tried a ruse, a ruse they hoped would work\non these beings; but they who never before had to plan a war in space,\nwere not sure that their opponents had not had experience in the art.\nTrue, the Nigrans hadn't revealed any especially striking\ngeneralship--had, in fact, committed some inexcusable blunders--but they\ncouldn't be sure. Though they didn't know it, the Solarians had the\nadvantage of thousands of years of planetary warfare to rely on. This\nstood them in good stead now.\n\nThe Nigrans were rallying rapidly. To their surprise, the forces of the\nSolarians were dwindling, and no matter how desperately this remnant\nfought, they could not hold back the entire force of the Nigran fliers.\nAt last it appeared certain that the small ships could completely engage\nthe Solarian fleet!\n\nQuickly the giant cruisers formed a great dense cone of attack, and at a\ngiven signal, the fliers cleared a hole for them through the great\ndisc-shaped shield of the defenders. And with all their rays fanned out\nin a 100% overlap ahead of them, the Nigran fleet plunged through the\ndisc of ships at close to four hundred miles per second. They broke\nthrough--were on their way to the unprotected planets!\n\nThe Solarian ships closed the gap behind them, and eighteen of the giant\nships burst into wreckage as powerful beams found them, but for the most\npart the remnant of the defending forces were far too busy with the\nfliers to attack the large ships. Now, as the monster engines of\ndestruction raced on toward the planets still approximately two billion\nmiles away, they knew that, far behind them, their fliers were engaging\nthe Solarians. They had left their guard--but the guard was keeping the\nenemy occupied while they were free to drive in!\n\nThen from nowhere came the counterattack! Nearly five thousand\nthirty-man ships of Earth and Venus, invisible in the darkness of space,\nsuddenly leaped into action as the dreadnoughts sped past. Their\ndestroying rays played over the nigh-helpless giants, and the huge ships\nwere crumbling into colossal derelicts. With the last of their guard\nstripped from them, they fell easy prey to the attackers. Faster than\nthey could keep count they were losing their warships of space!\n\nThe ruse had worked perfectly! Nearly all of the ten-man and one-man\nships had been left behind them in the original disc, while all the\nthirty-man light cruisers, and a few hundred each of the ten-man and\none-man crafts sped away to form a great ring twenty thousand miles\nfarther back. The Nigran fleet had flown blindly into the ambush.\n\nThere was only one thing left for them to do. They were defeated. They\nmust return to their far-off black star and leave the Solarians in\npossession of their worlds. For all battle purposes their great force\nwas nearly wiped out, only the fliers remained in force; and these could\nno longer be carried in the remnant of the great liners. Swiftly they\nfell back, passing again through the disc, losing thirty more vessels,\nthen raced swiftly away from the fleet of their enemies.\n\nThe Solarians, however, were not content. Their ships were forming in a\ngiant hollow cylinder, and as the sphere of the Nigrans retreated, their\nbeams playing behind them, the cylinder moved forward until it\nsurrounded them, and they raced together toward the distant lightless\nsun. The Solar end of the cylinder swiftly closed, blocked by a group of\nhuge ships which had taken no visible part in the battle. The Nigrans\nhad stopped using their rays; and the Solarians followed in armed\nreadiness, not molesting as long as they were not molested.\n\nMany days this strange flight lasted, till at last the great yellow sun,\nSol, had faded in the distance to an unusually brilliant star. Then,\nsuddenly visible out of the darkness, a strange black world loomed\nahead, and the Nigran ships settled swiftly toward it. Through the\nairlocks the great liners settled to their planet. No action was taken\nso long as the Solarian ships were not menaced, but for eight long\nmonths the darting ships hung above the four englobed worlds of Nigra.\n\nThen at last the astronomers of Earth and Venus sent through the\nbillions of miles of ether their message of safety. The guard could\nreturn home, for the sun they had been guarding would soon be too far\nfrom Earth or Venus to make any attack logical. Despite this, for years\nto come the fleet would guard the rim of the System, just to be sure;\nbut it appeared that the suns had passed, never again to meet.\n\nA strange thing had happened during the passing of the stars. Pluto no\nlonger circled Sol; it had been captured by Nigra! The great fleet\nreturned to a changed Solar system. Sol was still at its center, but\nthere were now ten planets, including two new ones that the sun had\ncaptured from Nigra in return for Pluto; and all the planets had shifted\na bit in their orbits.\n\nWhat the ultimate effect on the planets will be, we cannot say as yet.\nThe change thus far is certainly not very great, though a somewhat\nwarmer climate exists now on Earth, and it is a bit cooler on Venus. The\nlong-range difference, however, will be exceedingly interesting.\n\nThe Solar System has just passed through an experience which is probably\nunique in all the history of the mighty nebula of which our sun is an\ninfinitesimal part. The chances that one star, surrounded by a system of\nplanets, should pass within a hundred billion miles of another star,\nsimilarly accompanied, was one in billions of billions. That both\nsystems should have been inhabited by intelligent races--\n\nIt is easy to understand why the scientists could not believe Arcot's\ntheory of attack from another sun until they had actually seen those\nother worlds.\n\nIn that war between two solar systems we learned much and lost much.\nYet, in all probability we gained more than we lost, for those two\nnew-old planets will mean tremendous things to us. Already scientists\nare at work in the vast museums and ancient laboratories that are on\nthem, and every day new things are being discovered. We lost many men,\nbut we saved our worlds, and we learned many invaluable secrets from the\ninvaders. In addition, we have but scratched the surface of a science\nthat is at least a thousand million years old!\n\n\n\n\nEPILOGUE\n\n\nTaj Lamor looked out across the void of space toward a fading point of\nyellow light. Far in the distance it glowed, and every second moved it\nmany more miles farther from him. They had lost their struggle for life\nand a new sun, he had thought when he turned back, defeated, from that\ndistant sun. But time had brought new hope.\n\nThey had lost many men in that struggle, and their dwindling resources\nhad been strained to the limit, but now there was hope, for a new spirit\nhad been born in their race. They had fought, and lost, but they had\ngained a spirit of adventure that had been dormant for millions of\nyears.\n\nBelow him, in the great dim mass that was their city, he knew that many\nlaboratories were in the full swing of active work. Knowledge and its\napplication were being discovered and rediscovered. New uses were being\nfound for old things, and their daily life was changing. It was again a\nrace awake, rejuvenated by a change!\n\nAs the great sea of yellow fire that was that strange sun had faded\nbehind their fleeing ships, leaving their dead planets still circling a\ndead sun, he had thought their last chance was gone forever. But hope\nhad reawakened, with the birth of new ideas, new ways of doing things.\n\nTordos Gar had been right! They had lost--but in the losing, they had\nwon!\n\nTaj Lamor shifted his gaze to a blazing point of light, where a titanic\nsea of flame was burning with a brilliance and power that, despite the\ngreater distance, made the remote yellow sun seem pale and dim. The\nblue-white glow told of a monster star, a star far brighter than the one\nthey had just left. It had become the brightest star in their heavens.\nOn their ancient star charts it was listed as a red giant, named\nTongsil-239-e, which meant it was of the fifth magnitude and very\ndistant. But in the long ages that had passed since it was classified,\nit had become a mighty sun--a star in its prime.\n\nHow were they to reach it? It was eight and one half light years away!\n\nTheir search for the force that would swing a world from its orbit had\nat last been successful. The knowledge had come too late to aid them in\ntheir fight for the yellow sun, but they might yet use it--they might\neven tear their planets from their orbits, and drive them as free bodies\nacross the void. It would take ages to make the trip--but long ages had\nalready passed as their dark planet swung through the void. What\ndifference would it make if they were or were not accompanied by a dead\nstar?\n\nTrue, the star that was now their goal was a double star; their planets\ncould not find orbits about it, but they might remedy that--they could\ntear one star free and hurl it into space, making the remaining sun\nsuitable for their use.\n\nBut they _would_ escape this dead sun.\n\n\n\n\nCLASSICS OF GREAT SCIENCE-FICTION from ACE BOOKS\n\n\nF-295 (40\u00a2) THE WORLD OF NULL-A\n            by A.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
