It had to be all or nothing ...\n               with one man doing every bit of scoring!\n\n\nArthur Lanceford slapped futilely at the sith buzzing hungrily around\nhis head. The outsized eight-legged parody of a mosquito did a neat\nhalf roll and zoomed out of range, hanging motionless on vibrating\nwings a few feet away.\n\nA raindrop staggered it momentarily, and for a fleeting second,\nLanceford had the insane hope that the arthropod would fall out of\ncontrol into the mud. If it did, that would be the end of it, for\nNiobian mud was as sticky as flypaper. But the sith righted itself\ninches short of disaster, buzzed angrily and retreated to the shelter\nof a nearby broadleaf, where it executed another half roll and hung\nupside down, watching its intended meal with avid anticipation.\n\nLanceford eyed the insect distastefully as he explored his jacket for\nrepellent and applied the smelly stuff liberally to his face and neck.\nIt wouldn't do much good. In an hour, his sweat would remove whatever\nthe rain missed--but for that time, it should discourage the sith. As\nfar as permanent discouraging went, the repellent was useless. Once\none of those eight-legged horrors checked you off, there were only two\npossible endings to the affair--either you were bitten or you killed\nthe critter.\n\nIt was as simple as that.\n\nHe had hoped that he would be fast enough to get the sith before it got\nhim. He had been bitten once already and the memory of those paralyzed\nthree minutes while the bloodsucker fed was enough to last him for\na lifetime. He readjusted his helmet, tucking its fringe of netting\nbeneath his collar. The netting, he reflected gloomily, was like its\nowner--much the worse for wear. However, this trek would be over in\nanother week and he would be able to spend the next six months at a\ncomfortable desk job at the Base, while some other poor devil did the\nchores of field work.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe looked down the rain-swept trail winding through the jungle.\nNiobe--a perfect name for this wet little world. The Bureau of\nExtraterrestrial Exploration couldn't have picked a better, but the\nfunny thing about it was that they hadn't picked it in the first place.\nNiobe was the native word for Earth, or perhaps \"the world\" would be\na more accurate definition. It was a coincidence, of course, but the\nplanet and its mythological Greek namesake had much in common.\n\nNiobe, like Niobe, was all tears--a world of rain falling endlessly\nfrom an impenetrable overcast, fat wet drops that formed a grieving\nbackground sound that never ceased, sobbing with soft mournful noises\non the rubbery broadleaves, crying with obese splashes into forest\npools, blubbering with loud, dismal persistence on the sounding\nboard of his helmet. And on the ground, the raindrops mixed with the\nloesslike soil of the trail to form a gluey mud that clung in huge\npasty balls to his boots.\n\nEverywhere there was water, running in rivulets of tear-streaks down\nthe round cheeks of the gently sloping land--rivulets that merged and\nblended into broad shallow rivers that wound their mourners' courses\nto the sea. Trekking on Niobe was an amphibious operation unless\none stayed in the highlands--a perpetual series of fords and river\ncrossings.\n\nAnd it was hot, a seasonless, unchanging, humid heat that made a\nprotection suit an instrument of torture that slowly boiled its wearer\nin his own sweat. But the suit was necessary, for exposed human flesh\nwas irresistible temptation to Niobe's bloodsucking insects. Many of\nthese were no worse than those of Earth, but a half dozen species were\ndeadly. The first bite sensitized. The second killed--anaphylactic\nshock, the medics called it. And the sith was one of the deadly species.\n\nLanceford shrugged fatalistically. Uncomfortable as a protection suit\nwas, it was better to boil in it than die without it.\n\nHe looked at Kron squatting beside the trail and envied him. It was\ntoo bad that Earthmen weren't as naturally repellent to insects as\nthe dominant native life. Like all Niobians, the native guide wore no\nclothing--ideal garb for a climate like this. His white, hairless hide,\nwith its faint sheen of oil, was beautifully water-repellent.\n\nKron, Lanceford reflected, was a good example of the manner in which\nNature adapts the humanoid form for survival on different worlds.\nLike the dominant species on every intelligent planet in the explored\ngalaxy, he was an erect, bipedal, mammalian being with hands that\npossessed an opposable thumb. Insofar as that general description went,\nKron resembled humanity--but there were differences.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSquatting, the peculiar shape of Kron's torso and the odd flexibility\nof his limbs were not apparent. One had the tendency to overlook the\nnarrow-shouldered, cylindrical body and the elongated tarsal and carpal\nbones that gave his limbs four major articulations rather than the\nhuman three, and to concentrate upon the utterly alien head.\n\nIt jutted forward from his short, thick neck, a long-snouted, vaguely\ndoglike head with tiny ears lying close against the hairless,\ndome-shaped cranium. Slitlike nostrils, equipped with sphincter\nmuscles like those of a terrestrial seal, argued an originally aquatic\nenvironment, and the large intelligent eyes set forward in the skull to\ngive binocular vision, together with the sharp white carnassial teeth\nand pointed canines, indicated a carnivorous ancestry. But the modern\nNiobians, although excellent swimmers, were land dwellers and ate\nanything.\n\nLanceford couldn't repress an involuntary shudder at some of the\nthings they apparently enjoyed. Tastes differed--enormously so between\nEarthmen and Niobians.\n\nThere was no doubt that the native was intelligent, yet he, like the\nrest of his race, was a technological moron. It was strange that a race\nwhich had a well-developed philosophy and an amazing comprehension of\nsemantics could be so backward in mechanics. Even the simpler of the\nBEE's mechanisms left the natives confused. It was possible that they\ncould learn about machinery, but Lanceford was certain that it would\ntake a good many years before the first native mechanic would set up a\nmachine shop on this planet.\n\nLanceford finished tucking the last fold of face net under his collar,\nand as he did so, Kron stood up, rising to his five-foot height\nwith a curious flexible grace. Standing, he looked something like a\ndouble-jointed alabaster Anubis--wearing swim fins. His broad, webbed\nfeet rested easily on the surface of the mud, their large area giving\nhim flotation that Lanceford envied. As a result, his head was nearly\nlevel with that of the human, although there was better than a foot\ndifference in their heights.\n\nLanceford looked at Kron inquiringly. \"You have a place in mind where\nwe can sleep tonight?\"\n\n\"Sure, Boss. We'll be coming to hunthouse soon. We go now?\"\n\n\"Lead on,\" Lanceford said, groaning silently to himself--another\nhunthouse with its darkness and its smells. He shrugged. He could\nhardly expect anything else up here in the highlands. Oh, well, he'd\nmanaged to last through the others and this one could be no worse. At\nthat, even an airless room full of natives was preferable to spending\na night outside. And the sith wouldn't follow them. It didn't like\nairless rooms filled with natives.\n\nHe sighed wearily as he followed Kron along the dim path through the\nbroadleaf jungle. Night was coming, and with darkness, someone upstairs\nturned on every faucet and the sheets of rain that fell during the day\nchanged abruptly into a deluge. Even the semi-aquatic natives didn't\nlike to get caught away from shelter during the night.\n\nThe three moved onward, immersed in a drumming wilderness of rain--the\nNiobian sliding easily over the surface of the mud, the Earthman\nplowing painfully through it, and the sith flitting from the shelter of\none broadleaf to the next, waiting for a chance to feed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe trail widened abruptly, opening upon one of the small clearings\nthat dotted the rain-forest jungle. In the center of the clearing,\ndimly visible through the rain and thickening darkness, loomed the\nsquat thatch-roofed bulk of a hunthouse, a place of shelter for the\nmembers of the hunters' guild who provided fresh meat for the Niobian\nvillages. Lanceford sighed a mingled breath of relief and unpleasant\nanticipation.\n\nAs he stepped out into the clearing, the sith darted from cover,\nheading like a winged bullet for Lanceford's neck. But the man was\nnot taken by surprise. Pivoting quickly, he caught the iridescent\nblur of the bloodsucker's wings. He swung his arm in a mighty slap.\nThe high-pitched buzz and Lanceford's gloved hand met simultaneously\nat his right ear. The buzz stopped abruptly. Lanceford shook his head\nand the sith fell to the ground, satisfactorily swatted. Lanceford\ngrinned--score one for the human race.\n\nHe was still grinning as he pushed aside the fiber screen closing the\nlow doorway of the hunthouse and crawled inside. It took a moment for\nhis eyes to become accustomed to the gloom within, but his nose told\nhim even before his eyes that the house was occupied. The natives, he\nthought wryly, must be born with no sense of smell, otherwise they'd\nperish from sheer propinquity. One could never honestly say that\nfamiliarity with the odor of a Niobian bred contempt--nausea was the\nright word.\n\nThe interior was typical, a dark rectangle of windowless limestone\nwalls enclosing a packed-dirt floor and lined with a single deck of\nwooden sleeping platforms. Steeply angled rafters of peeled logs\nintersected at a knife-sharp ridge pierced with a circular smokehole\nabove the firepit in the center of the room. Transverse rows of\nsmaller poles lashed to the rafters supported the thick broadleaf\nthatch that furnished protection from the rain and sanctuary for\nuncounted thousands of insects.\n\nA fire flickered ruddily in the pit, hissing as occasional drops of\nrain fell into its heart from the smokehole, giving forth a dim light\ntogether with clouds of smoke and steam that rose upward through\nthe tangled mass of greasy cobwebs filling the upper reaches of the\nrafters. Some of the smoke found its way through the smokehole, but\nmost of it hung in an acrid undulating layer some six feet above the\nfloor.\n\nThe glow outlined the squatting figures of a dozen or so natives\nclustered around the pit, watching the slowly rotating carcass of a\nsmall deerlike rodent called a sorat, which was broiling on a spit\nabove the flames. Kron was already in the ring, talking earnestly to\none of the hunters--a fellow-tribesman, judging from the tattoo on his\nchest.\n\nTo a Niobian, the scene was ordinary, but to Lanceford it could have\nbeen lifted bodily from the inferno. He had seen it before, but the\neffect lost nothing by repetition. There was a distinctly hellish\nquality to it--to the reds and blacks of the flickering fire and the\nshadows. He wouldn't have been particularly surprised if Satan himself\nappeared in the center of the firepit complete with horns, hoofs and\ntail. A hunthouse, despite its innocuousness, looked like the southeast\ncorner of Hades.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nClustered around the fire, the hunters turned to look at him curiously\nand, after a single eye-filling stare, turned back again. Niobians\nwere almost painfully polite. Although Earthmen were still enough of a\ncuriosity to draw attention, one searching look was all their customs\nallowed. Thereafter, they minded their own business. In some ways,\nLanceford reflected, native customs had undeniable merit.\n\nPresently Kron rose from his place beside the fire and pointed out two\nempty sleeping platforms where they would spend the night. Lanceford\nchose one and sank wearily to its resilient surface. Despite its crude\nconstruction, a Niobian sleeping platform was comfortable. He removed\nhis pack, pulled off his mud-encrusted boots and lay back with a grunt\nof relaxation. After a day like this, it was good to get off his feet.\nWeariness flowed over him.\n\nHe awoke to the gentle pressure of Kron's hand squeezing his own. \"The\nfood is cooked,\" the Niobian said, \"and you are welcomed to share it.\"\n\nLanceford nodded, his stomach crawling with unpleasant anticipation.\nA native meal was something he would prefer to avoid. His digestive\nsystem could handle the unsavory mess, but his taste buds shrank from\nthe forthcoming assault. What the natives classed as a delicate and\nelusive flavor was sheer torture to an Earthman.\n\nPossibly there was some connection between their inefficient olfactory\napparatus and their odd ideas of flavor, but whatever the physical\nexplanation might be, it didn't affect the fact that eating native\nfood was an ordeal. Yet he couldn't refuse. That would be discourteous\nand offensive, and one simply didn't offend the natives. The BEE was\nexplicit about that. Courtesy was a watchword on Niobe.\n\nHe took a place by the fire, watching with concealed distaste as one\nof the hunters reached into the boiling vat beside the firepit with a\npair of wooden tongs and drew forth the native conception of a hors\nd'oeuvre. They called it vorkum--a boiled sorat paunch stuffed with a\nnumber of odorous ingredients. It looked almost as bad as it smelled.\n\nThe hunter laid the paunch on a wooden trencher, scraped the greenish\nscum from its surface and sliced it open. The odor poured out, a\ngagging essence of decaying vegetables, rotten eggs and overripe\ncheese.\n\nLanceford's eyes watered, his stomach tautened convulsively, but the\nNiobians eyed the reeking semi-solid eagerly. No meal on Niobe was\nconsidered worthy of the name unless a generous helping of vorkum\nstarted it off.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAn entree like that could ruin the most rugged human appetite, but\nwhen it was the forerunner of a main dish of highly spiced barbecue,\nvorkum assumed the general properties of an emetic. Lanceford grimly\ncontrolled the nausea and tactfully declined the greasy handful which\nKron offered. The Niobian never seemed to learn. At every meal they had\neaten during their past month of travel on Niobe, Kron had persistently\noffered him samples of the mess. With equal persistence, he had\nrefused. After all, there were limits.\n\nBut polite convention required that he eat something, so he took a\nsmall portion of the barbecued meat and dutifully finished it. The\nhunters eyed him curiously, apparently wondering how an entity who\ncould assimilate relatively untasty sorat should refuse the far greater\ndelicacy of vorkum. But it was a known fact that the ways of Earthmen\nwere strange and unaccountable.\n\nThe hunters didn't protest when he retired to his sleeping platform and\nthe more acceptable concentrates from his pack. His hunger satisfied,\nhe lay back on the resilient vines and fell into a sleep of exhaustion.\nIt had been a hard day.\n\nLanceford's dreams were unpleasant. Nightmare was the usual penalty of\nsitting in on a Niobian meal and this one was worse than usual. Huge\nsiths, reeking of vorkum, pursued him as he ran naked and defenseless\nacross a swampy landscape that stretched interminably ahead. The\nclinging mud reduced his speed to a painful crawl as he frantically\nbeat off the attacks of the blood-suckers.\n\nThe climax was horror. One of the siths slipped through his frantically\nbeating hands and bit him on the face. The shocking pain of the bite\nwakened him, a cry of terror and anguish still on his lips.\n\nHe looked around wildly. He was still in the hunthouse. It was just a\ndream.\n\nHe chuckled shakily. These nightmares sometimes were too real for\ncomfort. He was drenched with sweat, which was not unusual, but there\nwas a dull ache in his head and the hot tense pain that encompassed the\nright side of his face had not been there when he had fallen asleep.\n\nHe touched his face with a tentative finger, exploring the hot\npuffiness and the enormously swollen ear with a gentle touch. It was\nwhere he had struck the sith, but surely he couldn't have hit that hard.\n\nHe gasped, a soft breath of dismay, as realization dawned. He had\nsmashed the sith hard enough to squeeze some of the insect's corrosive\nbody juices through his face net--and they had touched his skin! That\nwouldn't normally have been bad, but the sith bite he had suffered\na week ago had sensitized him. He was developing an anaphylactic\nreaction--a severe one, judging from the swelling.\n\nThat was the trouble with exploration; one occasionally forgot that a\nworld was alien. Occasionally danger tended to recede into a background\nof familiarity--he had smashed the sith before it had bitten him, so\ntherefore it couldn't hurt him. He grimaced painfully, the movement\nbringing another twinge to his swollen face. He should have known\nbetter.\n\nHe swore mildly as he opened his Aid Kit and extracted a sterile hypo.\nThe super-antihistamine developed by the Bureau was an unpredictable\nsort of thing. Sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't. He removed\nthe screw cap that sealed the needle and injected the contents of the\nsyringe into his arm. He hoped that this was one of the times the drug\nworked. If it wasn't, he reflected grimly, he wouldn't be long for this\nworld.\n\nHe sighed and lay back. There wasn't anything more to do now. All he\ncould do was wait and see if the anti-allergen worked.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Bureau of Extraterrestrial Exploration had discovered Niobe barely\nthree years ago, yet already the planet was famous not only for its\npeculiar climate, but also for the number of men who had died upon its\nwatery surface. Knowledge of this planet was bought with life, grim\npayment to decrease the lag between discovery and the day men could\nlive and work on Niobe without having to hide beneath domes or behind\nprotection suits. Lanceford never questioned the necessity or the\ninevitable price that must be paid. Like every other BEE agent, he knew\nthat Niobe was crash priority--a world that _had_ to be understood in\nminimum time.\n\nFor Niobe was a made to order herbarium for a swampland plant called\nviscaya. The plant was originally native to Algon IV, but had been\nspread to practically every suitable growth center in the Galaxy.\nIt was the source of a complex of alkaloids known as gerontin, and\ngerontin had the property of tripling or quadrupling the normal life\nspan of mammals.\n\nIt was obvious that viscayaculture should have a tremendous\ndistribution throughout the Confederation worlds. But unfortunately the\nright conditions existed in very few places in the explored galaxy.\nDespite the fact that most life is based on carbon, oxygen and water,\nthere is still very little free water in the Galaxy. Most planets of\nthe Confederation are semi-arid, with the outstanding exceptions of\nTerra and Lyrane. But these two worlds were the seats of human and\nhumanoid power for so long that all of their swampland had been drained\nand reclaimed centuries ago.\n\nAnd it was doubly unfortunate that gerontin so far defied synthesis.\nAccording to some eminent chemists, the alkaloid would probably\ncontinue to do so until some facet of the Confederation reached a Class\nVIII culture level. Considering that Terra and Lyrane, the two highest\ncultures, were only Class VII, and that Class level steps took several\nthousands of years to make, a policy of waiting for synthesis was not\nworth considering.\n\nThe result was that nobody was happy until Niobe was discovered.\nThe price of illicit gerontin was astronomical and most of the\nConfederation's supply of the drug was strictly rationed to those whom\nthe government thought most valuable to the Confederation as a whole.\nOf course, the Confederation officialdom was included, which caused\nconsiderable grumbling. In the nick of time, Niobe appeared upon the\nscene, and Niobe had environment in abundance!\n\nThe wheels of the Confederation began to turn. The BEE was given a\nblank check and spurred on by a government which, in turn, was being\nspurred on by the people who composed it. The exploration of Niobe\nproceeded at all possible speed. With so many considerations weighed\nagainst them, what did a few lives matter? For the sake of the billions\nof humanoids in the Confederation, their sacrifice was worthwhile\neven if only a few days or hours were saved between discovery and\nexploitation.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLanceford groaned as a violent pain shot through his head. The\nanti-allergin apparently wasn't going to work, for it should have had\nsome effect by now. He shrugged mentally--it was the chance one took in\nthis business. But he couldn't say that he hadn't been warned. Even old\nSims had told him, called him a unit in the BEE's shortcut trial and\nerror scheme--an error, it looked like now.\n\nSeemed rather silly--a Class VII civilization using techniques that\nwere old during the Dark Ages before the Atomic Revolution, sending\nfoot parties to explore a world in the chance that they might discover\nsomething that the search mechs missed--anything that would shorten the\nlag time. It was incomprehensible, but neither Sims nor the BEE would\ndo a thing like this without reason. And whatever it was, he wasn't\ngoing to worry about it. In fact, there wasn't much time left to worry.\nThe reaction was observably and painfully worse.\n\nIt was important that the news of his death and the specimens he had\ncollected get back to Base Alpha. They might have value in this complex\ngame Alvord Sims was playing with men, machines and Niobe. But Base\nAlpha was a good hundred miles away and, in his present condition, he\ncouldn't walk a hundred feet.\n\nFor a moment, he considered setting up the powerful little transmitter\nhe carried in his pack, but his first abortive motion convinced him it\nwas useless. The blinding agony that swept through him at the slightest\nmovement left no doubt that he would never finish the business of\nsetting up the antenna, let alone send a message.\n\nIt was a crime that handie-talkies couldn't be used here on Niobe, but\ntheir range, limited at best, was practically nonexistent on a planet\nthat literally seemed to be one entire \"dead spot.\" A fixed-frequency\njob broadcasting on a directional beam was about the only thing that\ncould cover distance, and that required a little technical know-how to\nset up the antenna and focus it on Base Alpha. There would be no help\nfrom Kron. Despite his intelligence, the native could no more assemble\na directional antenna than spread pink wings and fly.\n\nThere was only one thing to do--get a note off to Sims, if he could\nstill write, and ask Kron to deliver the note and his pack to the Base.\n\nHe fumbled with his jacket, and with some pain produced a stylus and a\npad. But it was difficult to write. Painful, too. Better get Kron over\nhere while he could still talk and tell him what he wanted.\n\nThe stylus slipped from numb fingers as Lanceford called hoarsely,\n\"Kron! Come here! I need you!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKron looked down compassionately at the swollen features of the\nEarthman. He had seen the kef effect before, among the young of his\npeople who were incautious or inexperienced, but he had never seen it\namong the aliens. Surprisingly, the effects were the same--the livid\nswellings, the gasping breath, the pain. Strange how these foreigners\nreacted like his own people.\n\nHe scratched his head and pulled thoughtfully at one of his short ears.\nIt was his duty to help Lanceford, but how could he? The Earthman\nhad denied his help for weeks, and Niobians simply didn't disregard\nanother's wishes. Kron scowled, the action lending a ferocious cast to\nhis doglike face. Tolerance was a custom hallowed by ages of practice.\nIt went to extremes--even with life at stake, a person's wishes and\nbeliefs must be respected.\n\nKron buried his long-snouted head in his hands, a gesture that held in\nit all the frustration which filled him.\n\nThe human was apparently resolved to die. He had told Kron his last\nwishes, which didn't include a request for help, but merely to get\nhis pack back to the others in their glass dome. It was astonishing\nthat such an obviously intelligent species should have so little\nflexibility. They didn't understand the first principles of adaptation.\nAlways and forever, they held to their own ways, trying with insensate\nstubbornness to mold nature to their will--and when nature overcome\ntheir artificial defenses, they died, stubborn, unregenerate,\ninflexible to the end. They were odd, these humans--odd and a little\nfrightening.\n\nLanceford breathed wheezily. The swelling had invaded the inner\ntissues of his throat and was beginning to compress his windpipe. It\nwas uncomfortable, like inhaling liquid fire, and then there was the\nconstant desire to cough and the physical inability to do so.\n\n\"Dirty luck,\" he whispered. \"Only a week more and I'd have had it\nmade--the longest trek a man's made on this benighted planet.\"\n\nKron nodded, but then belatedly realized that the human was muttering\nto himself. He listened. There might be something important in these\ndying murmurings, something that might explain their reasons for being\nhere and their strange driving haste that cared nothing for life.\n\n\"It's hard to die so far from one's people, but I guess that can't be\nhelped. Old Sims gave me the score. Like he said, a man doesn't have\nmuch choice of where he dies in the BEE.\"\n\n\"You don't want to die!\" Kron exploded.\n\n\"Of course not,\" Lanceford said with weak surprise. He hadn't dreamed\nthat Kron was nearby. This might well destroy the Imperturbable\nEarthman myth that the BEE had fostered.\n\n\"Not even if it is in accord with your customs and rituals?\"\n\n\"What customs?\"\n\n\"Your clothing, your eating habits, your ointments--are these not part\nof your living plan?\"\n\nDespite the pain that tore at his throat, Lanceford managed a chuckle.\nThis was ridiculous. \"Hell, no! Our only design for living is to stay\nalive, particularly on jobs like this one. We don't wear these suits\nand repellent because we _like_ to. We do it to stay alive. If we\ncould, we'd go around nearly as naked as you do.\"\n\n\"Do you mind if I help you?\" Kron asked diffidently. \"I think I can\ncure you.\" He leaned forward anxiously to get the man's reply.\n\n\"I'd take a helping hand from the devil himself, if it would do any\ngood.\"\n\nKron's eyes were brilliant. He hummed softly under his breath, the\nNiobian equivalent of laughter. \"And all the time we thought--\" he\nbegan, and then broke off abruptly. Already too much time was wasted\nwithout losing any more in meditating upon the ironies of life.\n\nHe turned toward the firepit, searched for a moment among the stones,\nnodded with satisfaction and returned to where Lanceford lay. The\nhunthouse was deserted save for himself and the Earthman. With\ncharacteristic Niobian delicacy, the hunters had left, preferring to\nendure the night rain than be present when the alien died. Kron was\nthankful that they were gone, for what he was about to do would shock\ntheir conservative souls.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLanceford was dimly conscious of Kron prying his swollen jaws apart\nand forcing something wet and slippery down his throat. He swallowed,\nthe act a tearing pain to the edematous membranes of his gullet, but\nthe stuff slid down, leaving a trail of fire in its wake. The act\ntriggered another wave of pain that left him weak and gasping. He\ncouldn't take much more of this. It wouldn't be long now before the\nswelling invaded his lungs to such a degree that he would strangle. It\nwasn't a pleasant way to die.\n\nAnd then, quite suddenly, the pain eased. A creeping numbness spread\nlike a warm black blanket over his outraged nervous system. The stuff\nKron had given him apparently had some anesthetic properties. He felt\ndimly grateful, even though the primitive native nostrum would probably\ndo no good other than to ease the pain.\n\nThe blackness went just far enough to paralyze the superficial areas of\nhis nervous system. It stopped the pain and left him unable to move,\nbut the deeper pathways of thought and reason remained untouched. He\nwas conscious, although no external sensation intruded on his thoughts.\nHe couldn't see Kron--the muscles that moved his eyes were as paralyzed\nas the other muscles of his body and the native was outside his field\nof vision--but somehow he knew exactly what the Niobian was doing. He\nwas washing mucus from his hands in a bowl of water standing beside the\nfire pit _and he was wondering wryly whether forced feeding was on the\nlist of human tabus_!\n\nLanceford's mind froze, locked in a peculiar contact that was more\nthan awareness. The sensation was indescribable. It was like looking\nthrough an open door into the living room of a stranger's house.\n\nHe was aware of the incredible complexity and richness of Kron's\nthoughts, of oddly sardonic laughter, of pity and regret that such a\nlittle thing as understanding should cause death and suffering through\nits lack, of bewildered admiration for the grim persistence of the\nalien Earthmen, mixed with a wondering curiosity about what kept them\nhere--what the true reasons were for their death-defying persistence\nand stubbornness--of an ironic native paraphrase for the Terran saying,\n\"Every man to his own taste,\" and a profound speculation upon what\nfruits might occur from true understanding between his own race and the\naliens.\n\nIt was a strangely jumbled kaleidoscopic flash that burned across the\nexplorer's isolated mind, a flash that passed almost as soon as it had\ncome, as though an invisible door had closed upon it.\n\nBut one thing in that briefly shocking contact stood out with great\nclarity. The Niobians were as eager as the BEE to establish a true\ncontact, a true understanding, for the message was there, plain\nin Kron's mind that he was thinking not only for himself but for\na consensus of his people, a decision arrived at as a result of\ndiscussion and thought--a decision of which every Niobian was aware and\nwith which most Niobians agreed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe magnitude of that thought and its implications staggered\nLanceford's imagination.\n\nAfter two years of exploration and contact with the dominant race\nof this planet, the BEE still knew literally nothing about the sort\nof people with whom they were dealing. This instantaneous, neural\ncontact proved that. Equated against the information dished out in\nBasic Training, it merely emphasized the fact that the BEE was grossly\nignorant.\n\nAnthropological Intelligence had a lot to account for--the job they'd\ndone so far could have been performed by low-grade morons. In wishing\nto avoid the possibility of giving offense, in hiding behind a wall of\ncourtesy and convention, there had been no contact worthy of the name.\nYet here was the possibility of a rapport that could be closer than any\nwhich existed between any races in the Galaxy.\n\nLanceford groaned with silent frustration. To learn this when he was\ndying was the bitterest of ironies. In any other circumstances, the\nflash of insight could be parlayed into a key which might unlock the\nentire problem of Niobian relationships.\n\nBitterly he fought against the curtain of unconsciousness that closed\ndown on him, trying by sheer will to stay awake, to make some move that\ncould be interpreted, to leave some clue to what he had learned.\n\nIt was useless. The darkness closed in, inexorable and irresistible.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nArthur Lanceford opened his eyes, surprised that he was still alive.\nThe pain was gone from his face and the swelling had subsided. He\ngrinned with relief--his luck had held out.\n\nAnd then the relief vanished in a wave of elation. He held the key.\nHe knew the basics for mutual understanding. And he would be alive to\ndeliver them to the specialists who could make them operate.\n\nHe chuckled. Whatever the cure was--the BEE drug, Kron's treatment,\nwhatever it was, it didn't matter. The important thing was that he was\ngoing to live.\n\nHe wondered whether that flash of insight just before unconsciousness\nhad been real or a figment of delirium. It could have been either, but\nLanceford clung to the belief that the contact was genuine. There was\nfar too much revealed in that sudden flash that was entirely alien to\nhis normal patterns of thought.\n\nHe wondered what had triggered that burst of awareness. The BEE drug,\nthe stuff Kron had given him, the poison of the sith and the histamines\nfloating around in his system--it could have been any one of a number\nof things, or maybe a complex of various factors that had interacted to\nmake him super-receptive for an instant of time.\n\nIt was something that would have to be reported and studied with the\nmeticulous care which the BEE gave to any facet of experience that was\nout of the ordinary. A solution might possibly be found, or the whole\nthing might wind up as one of those dead ends that were so numerous in\nExploration work. But that was out of his field and, in consequence,\nout of his hands. His specialty wasn't parapsychological research.\n\nKron was standing beside his bed, long doglike face impassive, looking\nat him with pleased satisfaction. Behind him, a group of natives were\nclustered around the cooking fire. It was as if no time had passed\nsince the allergy struck--but Lanceford knew differently. Still, the\nlost time didn't matter. The bright joy that he was going to live\ntranscended such unimportant things.\n\n\"Looks like you won't have to bury me after all,\" Lanceford said\nhappily.\n\nHe stretched his arms over his head. He felt wonderful. His body was\ncool and comfortably free of the hot confinement of the protection\nsuit. He did a slow horrified doubletake as he realized that he was\nlying on the sleeping platform practically naked--a tempting hors\nd'oeuvre for the thousand and one species of Niobe's biting insects.\n\n\"Where's my suit?\" he half shouted.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKron smiled. \"You don't need it, friend Lanceford. If you will notice,\nyou are not bitten. Nor will you be.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\nKron didn't answer. It wasn't the proper time, and the euphoria that he\nand the Earthman were enjoying was too pleasant to shatter.\n\nLanceford didn't press the matter. Apparently Kron knew what he was\ntalking about. Lanceford had been watching one particularly vicious\nspecies of biting fly hover above his body. The insect would approach,\nready to enjoy a mandible full of human epidermis, but, about six\ninches from his body, would slow down and come to a stop, hanging\nfrustrated in midair. Finally the fly gave up and flew off into the\ndarkness of the rafters. Lanceford hoped that one of the spiders would\nget it--but he was convinced. Whatever happened to him while he was\nunconscious had made him as insect-repellent as the Niobians.\n\nThe smell of cooking came from the firepit and, incredibly, it smelled\ngood.\n\nLanceford looked startledly at Kron. \"I'm hungry.\"\n\n\"An excellent sign,\" Kron replied. \"You are nearly cured. Soon you will\nbe able to finish this trek.\"\n\n\"Incidentally,\" Lanceford said, \"for the first time since I have been\nout on this showerbath world of yours, you're cooking something that\nsmells fit to eat. I think I'd like to try it.\"\n\nKron's eyebrows rose and he hummed softly under his breath. This was\nsomething entirely unexpected--an added delight, like the flavor of\nkomal in a sorat stew. He savored it slowly, enjoying its implications.\n\n\"What is it?\" Lanceford persisted.\n\n\"A dish called akef,\" Kron said. The name was as good as any and\ncertainly described the effect well enough.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe last hundred miles had been a breeze. Lanceford stood at the\nedge of the clearing, looking across the planed-off landscape to the\nshimmering hemispherical bulk of Base Alpha, glistening like a giant\ncabochon jewel under Niobe's dark sky. Without the protection suit to\nslow him down and hamper his movements, what would have been a week's\ntrip had been shortened to four days.\n\nIn a few minutes, he would be back among his own kind--and he wasn't\nsure whether he was glad or sorry. Of course, there was a certain\nsatisfaction in bringing back a first-class discovery--perhaps the\ngreatest in the short history of Niobian exploration--but there was a\nstigma attached to the way it had been found. It wouldn't be easy to\nconfess that it had practically been forced upon him, but it would have\nto be done. It would have been much nicer to have found the answer by\nusing his head. There would have been some really deserved prestige in\nthat.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe sighed and turned to Kron. \"Farewell, friend,\" he said soberly, \"and\nthanks.\"\n\n\"We are even,\" Kron replied. \"You saved my life from a roka and I saved\nyours from the sith. The scales are balanced.\"\n\nLanceford blinked. He had forgotten that incident where he had shot the\nbig catlike animal shortly after the 'copter had dropped them for the\nstart of their journey back to Base. Apparently it was after Kron--or\nat least the native had thought so. Lanceford grinned ruefully. Score\nanother point for blind luck.\n\n\"But, Kron, it's not that easy. You have given me a secret of your\npeople and I shall have to tell it to mine.\"\n\n\"I expected that you would. Besides, it is no secret. Even our children\nknow its composition and how to make it. We have never held it from\nyou. You simply wouldn't accept it. But it is about time, friend\nLanceford, that your race began learning something of Niobe if they\nwish to remain here--and it is about time that we began learning\nsomething about you. I think that there will be some rather marked\nchanges in the future. And in that regard, I leave you with the\nquestion of whether a civilization should be judged entirely upon its\napparent technological achievements.\"\n\n\"I--\" Lanceford began.\n\n\"You have learned how we avoid the insects,\" Kron continued,\nmaneuvering past the abortive interruption, \"and perhaps someday you\nwill know the full answer to my question. But in the meantime, you and\nyour kind will be free to move through our world, to learn our ways,\nand to teach us yours. It should be a fair exchange.\"\n\n\"Thanks to akef,\" Lanceford said fervently, \"we should be able to do\njust that.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKron smiled. \"You have used the drug enough to have overcome the mental\nblock that prevented you from naming it before. The word I coined from\nyour own language of science is no longer necessary.\"\n\n\"I suppose not, but it's pleasanter to think of it that way.\"\n\n\"You Earthmen! Sometimes I wonder how you ever managed to achieve a\ncivilization with your strange attitudes toward unpleasant facts.\" Kron\nsmiled broadly, relishing the memory of his deception and Lanceford's\nshocked awakening to the truth. \"I hope,\" he continued, \"that you\nhave forgiven my little deceit and the destruction of your protective\nclothing.\"\n\n\"Of course. How could I do otherwise? It's so nice to be rid of that\nsweatbox that I'd forgive anything.\" Lanceford frowned. \"But there's\none thing that puzzles me. How did you disguise the stuff?\"\n\n\"I didn't,\" Kron replied cryptically. \"You did.\" He turned away and,\nwith characteristic Niobian abruptness, walked off into the jungle. His\njob was done and natives were never ones to dally with leavetaking,\nalthough their greetings were invariably ceremonious.\n\nLanceford watched until the native was out of sight and then walked\nslowly across the clearing toward the dome. He had learned a lot these\npast few days, enough to make him realize that his basic training had\nbeen so inadequate as to be almost criminal. It was lacking in many of\nthe essentials for survival and, moreover, was slanted entirely wrong\nfrom a psychological point of view.\n\nSure, it was good enough to enable a man to get along, but it seemed to\nbe particularly designed to deny the fact that the natives obviously\npossessed a first-rate culture of their own. It didn't say so directly,\nbut the implications were there. And that was wrong. The natives\npossessed a civilization that was probably quite as high as the one\nTerra possessed. It was simply oriented differently. One thing was\ncertain--the Confederation wasn't going to expropriate or exploit\n_this_ planet without the natives' consent. It would be suicide if they\ntried.\n\nHe grinned. Actually there would be no reason for such action. It\nwas always easier to deal with advanced races than to try to conquer\nor educate primitive ones. Kron had the right idea--understanding,\nexchange, appreciation--Confederation culture for Niobian. It would\nmake a good and productive synthesis.\n\nStill grinning, Lanceford opened the airlock and stepped inside,\nignoring the pop-eyed guard who eyed his shorts and sandals with an\nexpression of incredulous disbelief.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAlvord Sims, Regional Director, Niobe Division BEE, looked up from his\ndesk and smiled. The smile became a nose-wrinkling grimace as Lanceford\nswung the pack from his shoulders and set it carefully on the floor.\n\n\"Glad to see that you made it, Lanceford,\" Sims said. \"But what's that\nawful smell? You should have done something about it. You stink like a\nnative.\"\n\n\"All the baths in the world won't help, sir,\" Lanceford said woodenly.\n\nHe was tired of the stares and the sniffs he had encountered since he\nhad entered the base. In his present condition, a fellow-human smelled\nas bad to him as he did to them, but he didn't complain about it and he\nsaw no reason why they should. Humanity should apply more courtesy and\nconsideration to members of their own species.\n\n\"It's inside me,\" he explained. \"My metabolism's changed. And\nincidentally, sir, you don't smell so sweet yourself.\"\n\nSims sputtered for a moment and then shrugged. \"Perhaps not,\"\nhe admitted. \"One can't help sweating in this climate even with\nair-conditioning.\"\n\n\"It's the change inside me,\" Lanceford said. \"I suppose it'll wear off\nin time, once I've been on a normal diet. But I didn't think that was\ntoo important in view of the information I have. I've learned something\nvital, something that you should know at once. That's why I'm here.\"\n\n\"That's decent of you,\" Sims replied, \"but an interoffice memo would\nhave served just as well as a personal visit. My stomach isn't as good\nas it once was. Ulcers, you know.\"\n\n\"The executive's disease,\" Lanceford commented.\n\nSims nodded. \"Well, Arthur, what did you find that was so important?\"\n\n\"That we've been fools.\"\n\nSims sighed. \"That's nothing new. We've been fools since the day we\nleft Earth to try and conquer the stars.\"\n\n\"That's not what I mean, sir. I mean that we've been going at this\nNiobe business the wrong way. What we need is to understand the\nnatives, instead of trying to understand the planet.\"\n\n\"Out of the mouths of babes and probationers--\" Sims said with gentle\nirony.\n\n\"It pays off,\" Lanceford replied doggedly. \"Take my case. I've found\nout why the natives are insect-proof!\"\n\n\"That's a new wrinkle. Can you prove it?\"\n\n\"Certainly. I came the last hundred miles in shorts.\"\n\n\"What happened to your suit?\"\n\n\"Kron destroyed it accidentally.\"\n\n\"Accidentally--hah!\" Sims snorted. \"Niobians never do things\naccidentally.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLanceford looked sharply at the director. The observation carried a\nwealth of implications that his sharpened senses were quick to grasp.\n\"Then you know the natives aren't simple savages, the way we were\ntaught in Basic Training?\"\n\n\"Of course! They're a non-technical Class V at the very least--maybe\nhigher. Somehow they've never oriented their civilization along\nmechanical lines, or maybe they tried it once and found it wanting.\nBut no one in the upper echelons has ever thought they were stupid or\nuncivilized.\"\n\n\"Then why--\"\n\n\"Later,\" Sims said. \"You're entitled to an explanation, but right\nnow I'd appreciate it if you'd finish your statement. What makes the\nnatives insect-proof?\"\n\n\"Vorkum.\"\n\n\"That gunk?\"\n\n\"That's the repellent.\"\n\n\"In more ways than one,\" Sims said.\n\n\"It's not so bad after you get used to it. It just smells awful at\nfirst.\"\n\n\"That's an understatement, if I ever heard one.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Perhaps the lab can analyze it and find the active principle,\"\nLanceford said hopefully.\n\n\"If they do, I'll bet it is distilled quintessence of skunk,\" Sims\nreplied gloomily. \"I'll be willing to bet that our native friends tried\nthat trick ages ago and gave it up for a bad job. They're pretty fair\nbiochemists as well as being philosophers.\"\n\n\"Could be,\" Lanceford said thoughtfully. \"I never thought of that.\"\n\n\"You'd better start thinking all the time. These lads are _smart_.\nWhy do you think we have this complicated rigmarole about native\nrelations and respect? Man, we're running scared. We don't want to\nlose this planet, and anything less than the kid-glove treatment would\nbe sheer suicide until we learn how far we can go. These natives have\nan organization that'd knock your eye out. I didn't believe it myself\nuntil I got the proof. As you learn more about it, you'll understand\nwhat I mean. We're dealing with an ecological _unit_ on this planet!\"\n\n\"But I thought--\"\n\n\"That you were here to explore a primitive world?\"\n\n\"Wasn't that what I was trained for?\"\n\n\"No. We can do that sort of thing with a couple of geodetic cruisers.\nWe don't need men trekking through the jungles to assay a world's\nphysical resources. That business went out of date during the Dark\nAges. There's a better reason than that for these treks.\"\n\n\"Like what?\"\n\n\"You asked the question. Now answer it,\" Sims said. \"You have enough\ndata.\"\n\nLanceford thought for a moment \"I can see one reason,\" he said slowly.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"The trek could be a test. It could be used to determine whether or\nnot the probationer was a survival type--a sort of final examination\nbefore he's turned loose in a responsible job here in the BEE.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSims smiled. \"Bull's-eye! It's part of the speedup--a pretty brutal\npart, but one that can't be helped if we want to get this planet\nin line quickly enough to stop the riot that's brewing in the\nConfederation. It's as much for Niobe's good as ours, because the\nConfederation wants that gerontin like an alcoholic wants another\ndrink--and they're not going to wait for normal exploration and\ndevelopment. That's why the treks. It's a tough course. Failure can and\noften does mean death. Usually we can pull a misfit out in time, but\nnot always. If you live through the trek and we don't have to pull you\nout, though, you've proved yourself a survival type--and you're over\nthe first hurdle.\n\n\"Then we check with your guide and anyone you happen to meet en route.\nThe natives are very cooperative about such things. If you pass their\nevaluation, you're ready to join the club. It's been forming ever since\nwe landed here two years ago, but it's still pretty exclusive. It's the\nnucleus of the BEE's mission here, the one that'll get things rolling\nwith the gerontin plantations. We'll know about you in a few more\nminutes after the Cyb Unit gets through processing your data.\" Sims\ngrinned at the thunderstruck youngster.\n\nLanceford nodded glumly. \"I'll probably fail. I sure didn't use my\nhead. I never caught the significance of the trek, I failed to deduce\nthe reason for the insect-repellent qualities of the natives, and I\nmissed the implications of their culture until I had almost reached\nBase. Those things are obvious. Any analytical brain would have figured\nthem out.\"\n\n\"They're only obvious when you know what you're looking for,\" Sims said\ngently. \"Personally, I think you did an excellent job, considering the\nhandicaps you have faced. And the discovery of the vorkum was masterly.\"\n\nLanceford blushed. \"I hate to admit it, but Kron literally shoved the\nstuff down my throat.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean the _method_ by which you learned that vorkum was the\nstuff we've been searching for,\" Sims said. \"I meant the _results_ you\nobtained. Results are what count in this business. Call it luck if you\nwish, but there is more to it than that. Some people are just naturally\nlucky and those are the sort we need here. They're survival types. A\nlot is going to depend on having those so-called lucky people in the\nright places when we settle Niobe's status in the Confederation.\"\n\nHe paused as the message tube beside his desk burped a faint hiss of\ncompressed air and a carrier dropped out into the receiving basket.\n\n\"Somehow I think that this is your membership card to the club,\" he\nsaid. He read it, smiled, and passed the sheet to Lanceford. \"And now,\nArthur, before I appoint you as a Niobe Staff member, I'd like to know\none thing.\"\n\n\"What is that, sir?\"\n\n\"Just why in the name of hell did you bring that pack in here with you?\nI've just realized where that smell is coming from!\"\n\n\"I didn't dare leave it anywhere,\" Lanceford said. \"Someone might have\nthrown it down a disposal chute.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't blame them. That's vorkum you have in there, isn't it?\"\n\nLanceford nodded. \"Yes, sir. I didn't want to lose it.\"\n\n\"Why not? We can always get more from the natives if we need it.\"\n\n\"I know that, sir. _We_ can, but this is all _I'll_ get for the next\nsix months, and if I ration myself carefully, it might last that long.\nYou see, sir, it's mildly habit-forming--like cigarettes--and one gets\naccustomed to it. And besides, you really don't know what flavor is\nuntil you've tried vorkum on chocolate.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Survival Type, by J.F.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
