Occasionally a high-pitched note or two\ncame from the direction of the engineer; he could not spare much wind\nwhile clambering about the machinery, oil-can in hand. The architect,\nalone, ignored the famous tune.\n\n\"What I can't understand, Smith,\" he insisted, \"is how you draw the\nelectricity from the ether into this car without blasting us all to\ncinders.\"\n\nThe engineer squinted through an opal glass shutter into one of the\ntunnels, through which the anti-gravitation current was pouring. \"If you\ndidn't know any more about buildings than you do about machinery,\nJackson,\" he grunted, because of his squatting position, \"I'd hate to\nlive in one of your houses!\"\n\nThe architect smiled grimly. \"You're living in one of 'em right now,\nSmith,\" said he; \"that is, if you call this car a house.\"\n\nSmith straightened up. He was an unimportant-looking man, of medium\nheight and build, and bearing a mild, good-humored expression. Nobody\nwould ever look at him twice, would ever guess that his skull concealed\nan unusually complete knowledge of electricity, mechanisms, and such\npractical matters.\n\n\"I told you yesterday, Jackson,\" he said, \"that the air surrounding the\nearth is chock full of electricity. And--\"\n\n\"And that the higher we go, the more juice,\" added the other,\nremembering. \"As much as to say that it is the atmosphere, then, that\nprotects the earth from the surrounding voltage.\"\n\nThe engineer nodded. \"Occasionally it breaks through, anyhow, in the\nform of lightning. Now, in order to control that current, and prevent it\nfrom turning this machine, and us, into ashes, all we do is to pass the\njuice through a cylinder of highly compressed air, fixed in this wall.\nBy varying the pressure and dampness within the cylinder, we can\nregulate the flow.\"\n\nThe builder nodded rapidly. \"All right. But why doesn't the electricity\naffect the walls themselves? I thought they were made of steel.\"\n\nThe engineer glanced through the dead-light at the reddish disk of the\nEarth, hazy and indistinct at a distance of forty million miles. \"It\nisn't steel; it's a non-magnetic alloy. Besides, there's a layer of\ncrystalline sulphur between the alloy and the vacuum space.\"\n\n\"The vacuum is what keeps out the cold, isn't it?\" Jackson knew, but he\nasked in order to learn more.\n\n\"Keeps out the sun's heat, too. The outer shell is pretty blamed hot on\nthat side, just as hot as it is cold on the shady side.\" Smith seated\nhimself beside a huge electrical machine, a rotary converter which he\nnext indicated with a jerk of his thumb. \"But you don't want to forget\nthat the juice outside is no use to us, the way it is. We have to change\nit.\n\n\"It's neither positive nor negative; it's just neutral. So we separate\nit into two parts; and all we have to do, when we want to get away from\nthe earth or any other magnetic-sphere, is to aim a bunch of positive\ncurrent at the corresponding pole of the planet, or negative current at\nthe other pole. Like poles repel, you know.\"\n\n\"Listens easy,\" commented Jackson. \"Too easy.\"\n\n\"Well, it isn't exactly as simple as all that. Takes a lot of apparatus,\nall told,\" and the engineer looked about the room, his glance resting\nfondly on his beloved machinery.\n\nThe big room, fifty feet square, was almost filled with machines; some\nreached nearly to the ceiling, the same distance above. In fact, the\ninterior of the \"cube,\" as that form of sky-car was known, had very\nlittle waste space. The living quarters of the four men who occupied it\nhad to be fitted in wherever there happened to be room. The architect's\nown berth was sandwiched in between two huge dynamos.\n\nHe was thinking hard. \"I see now why you have such a lot of adjustments\nfor those tunnels,\" meaning the six square tubes which opened into the\nether through the six walls of the room. \"You've got to point the juice\npretty accurately.\"\n\n\"I should say so.\" Smith led the way to a window, and the two shaded\ntheir eyes from the lights within while they gazed at the ashy glow of\nMercury, toward which they were traveling. \"I've got to adjust the\ncurrent so as to point exactly toward his northern half.\" Smith might\nhave added that a continual stream of repelling current was still\ndirected toward the earth, and another toward the sun, away over to\ntheir right; both to prevent being drawn off their course.\n\n\"And how fast are we going?\"\n\n\"Four or five times as fast as mother earth: between eighty and ninety\nmiles per second. It's easy to get up speed out here, of course, where\nthere's no air resistance.\"\n\nAnother voice broke in. The geologist had finished his potatoes, and a\nsavory smell was already issuing from the frying pan. Years spent in the\nwilderness had made the geologist a good cook, and doubly welcome as a\nmember of the expedition.\n\n\"We ought to get there tomorrow, then,\" he said eagerly. Indoor life did\nnot appeal to him, even under such exciting circumstances. He peered at\nMercury through his binoculars. \"Beginning to show up fine now.\"\n\nThe builder improved upon Van Emmon's example by setting up the car's\nbiggest telescope, a four-inch tube of unusual excellence. All three\npronounced the planet, which was three-fourths \"full\" as they viewed it,\nas having pretty much the appearance of the moon.\n\n\"Wonder why there's always been so much mystery about Mercury?\" pondered\nthe architect invitingly. \"Looks as though the big five-foot telescope\non Mt. Wilson would have shown everything.\"\n\n\"Ask doc,\" suggested Smith, diplomatically. Jackson turned and hailed\nthe little man on the other side of the car. He looked up absently from\nthe scientific apparatus with which he had been making a test of the\nroom's chemically purified air, then he stepped to the oxygen tanks and\nclosed the flow a trifle, referring to his figures in the severely exact\nmanner of his craft. He crossed to the group.\n\n\"Mercury is so close to the sun,\" he answered the architect's question,\n\"he's always been hard to observe. For a long time the astronomers\ncouldn't even agree that he always keeps the same face toward the sun,\nlike the moon toward the earth.\"\n\n\"Then his day is as long as his year?\"\n\n\"Eighty-eight of our days; yes.\"\n\n\"Continual sunlight! He can't be inhabited, then?\" The architect knew\nvery little about the planets. He had been included in the party\nbecause, along with his professional knowledge, he possessed remarkable\nability as an amateur antiquarian. He knew as much about the doings of\nthe ancients as the average man knows of baseball.\n\nDr. Kinney shook his head. \"Not at present, certainly.\"\n\nInstantly Jackson was alert. \"Then perhaps there were people there at\none time!\"\n\n\"Why not?\" the doctor put it lightly. \"There's little or no atmosphere\nthere now, of course, but that's not saying there never has been. Even\nif he is such a little planet--less than three thousand, smaller than\nthe moon--he must have had plenty of air and water at one time, the same\nas the Earth.\"\n\n\"What's become of the air?\" Van Emmon wanted to know. Kinney eyed him in\nreproach. He said:\n\n\"You ought to know. Mercury has only two-fifths as much gravitation as\nthe earth; a man weighing a hundred and fifty back home would be only a\nsixty-pounder there. And you can't expect stuff as light as air to stay\nforever on a planet with no more pull than that, when the sun is on the\njob only thirty-six millions miles away.\"\n\n\"About a third as far as from the Earth to the sun,\" commented the\nengineer. \"By George, it must be hot!\"\n\n\"On the sunlit side, yes,\" said Kinney. \"On the dark side it is as cold\nas space itself--four hundred and sixty below, Fahrenheit.\"\n\nThey considered this in silence for some minutes. The builder went to\nanother window and looked at Venus, at that time about sixty million\nmiles distant, on the far side of the sun. They were intending to visit\n\"Earth's twin sister\" on their return. After a while he came back to the\ngroup, ready with another question:\n\n\"If Mercury ever was inhabited, then his day wasn't as long as it is\nnow, was it?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the doctor. \"In all probability he once had a day the same\nlength as ours. Mercury is a comparatively old planet, you know; being\nsmaller, he cooled off earlier than the earth, and has been more\naffected by the pull of the sun. But it's been a mighty long time since\nhe had a day like ours; before the earth was cool enough to live on,\nprobably.\"\n\n\"But since Mercury was made out of the same batch of material--\"\nprompted the geologist.\n\n\"No reason, then, why life shouldn't have existed there in the past!\"\nexclaimed the architect, his eyes sparkling with the instinct of the\nborn antiquarian. He glanced up eagerly as the doctor coughed\napologetically and said:\n\n\"Don't forget that, even if Mercury is part baked and part frozen, there\nmust be a region in between which is neither.\" He picked up a small\nglobe from the table and ran a finger completely around it from pole to\npole. \"So. There must be a narrow band of country where the sun is only\npartly above the horizon, and where the climate is temperate.\"\n\n\"Then--\" the architect almost shouted in his excitement, an excitement\nonly slightly greater than that of the other two--\"then, if there were\npeople on Mercury at one time--\"\n\nThe doctor nodded gravely. \"There may be some there now!\"\n\n\n\nII\n\nA DEAD CITY\n\n\nFrom a height of a few thousand miles Mercury, at first glance, strongly\nreminded them of the moon. The general effect was the same--leaden disk,\nwith slight prominences here and there on the circumference, and large,\nirregular splotches of a darkish shade relieved by a great many\nbrilliantly lighted areas, lines, and spots.\n\nA second glance, however, found a marked difference. Instead of the\ncraters, which always distinguished the moon, Mercury showed ranges of\nbona fide mountains.\n\nThe doctor gave a sigh of regret, mixed with a generous amount of\nexcitement. \"Too bad those mountains weren't distinguishable from the\nearth,\" he complained. \"We wouldn't have been so quick to brand Mercury\na dead world.\"\n\nThe others were too engrossed to comment. The sky-car was rapidly\nsinking nearer and nearer the planet; already Smith had stopped the\ncurrent with which he had attracted the cube toward the little world's\nnorthern hemisphere, and was now using negative voltage. This, in order\nto act as a brake, and prevent them from falling to destruction.\n\nSuddenly Van Emmon, the geologist, whose eyes had been glued to his\nbinoculars, gave an exclamation of wonder. \"Look at those faults!\" He\npointed toward a region south of that for which they were bound; what\nmight be called the planet's torrid zone.\n\nAt first it was hard to see; then, little by little, there unfolded\nbefore their eyes a giant, spiderlike system of chasms in the strange\nsurface beneath them. From a point almost directly opposite the sun,\nthese cracks radiated in a half-dozen different directions; vast,\nirregular clefts, they ran through mountain and plain alike. In places\nthey must have been hundreds of miles wide, while there was no guessing\nas to their depth. For all that the four in the cube could see, they\nwere bottomless.\n\n\"Small likelihood of anybody being alive there now,\" commented the\ngeologist skeptically. \"If the sun has dried it out enough to produce\nfaults like that, how could animal life exist?\"\n\n\"Notice, however,\" prompted the doctor, \"that the cracks do not extend\nall the way to the edge of the disk.\" This was true; all the great\nchasms ended far short of the \"twilight band\" which the doctor had\ndeclared might still contain life.\n\nBut as the sky-car rushed downward their attention became fixed upon the\nsurface directly beneath them, a point whose latitude corresponded\nroughly with that of New York on the Earth. It was a region of low-lying\nmountains, decidedly different from various precipitous ranges to be\nseen to the north and east. On the west, or left-hand side of this\ndistrict, a comparatively level stretch, with an occasional peak or two\nprojecting, suggested the ancient bed of an ocean.\n\nBy this time they were within a thousand miles. Smith threw on a little\nmore current; their speed diminished to a safer point, and they scanned\nthe approaching surface with the greatest of care. The architect, who\nwas a New Yorker, was strongly reminded of the fall aspect of the\nAppalachians; but Van Emmon, who was born and raised on the Pacific\ncoast, declared that the spot was almost exactly like the region north\nof San Francisco. \"If I didn't know where I was,\" he declared, \"I'd be\ntrying to locate Eureka right now.\"\n\nThe engineer smiled tolerantly. He had spent several years in Scotland,\nand he felt sure, he obligingly told the others, that this new locality\nwas far more like the Ben Lomond country than any other spot on earth.\nHe was so positive, he made the doctor, a New Zealander, smile quite\nbroadly.\n\n\"It is just like the hills near my home,\" he stated, with an air of\nfinality which made further discussion useless.\n\n\"There's a river!\" the architect suddenly exclaimed, pointing; then\nadded, before the others could comment, \"I mean, what was once a river.\"\nThey saw that he was right; an irregular but well-defined streak of\nsandy hue trickled down the middle of their chosen destination--a long,\nL-shaped valley, surrounded by low hills.\n\n\"That's the most likely place, outside of the twilight zone, for life to\nbe found,\" remarked the doctor. \"Neither mountainous nor dead level.\"\n\nHe added: \"The spectroscope has plainly shown that there's water vapor\nin what little air there is. Must be precious little. If the air was as\nhumid as the earth's, we couldn't see the surface at all from this\nheight.\"\n\nThe inviting-looking valley was now less than a hundred miles below.\nInviting, however, only in outline; in color it was a grayish buff,\nscorched and forbidding. The hills were yellower, and an alkali white on\ntheir summits.\n\n\"Do either of you fellows see anything GREEN?\" demanded the engineer, a\nlittle later. They were silent; each had noticed long before, that not\neven near the poles was there the slightest sign of vegetation.\n\n\"No chance unless there's foliage,\" muttered the doctor, half to\nhimself. The builder asked what he meant. He explained: \"So far as we\nknow, all animal life depends upon vegetation for its oxygen. Not only\nthe oxygen in the air, but that stored in the plants which animals eat.\nUnless there's greenery--\"\n\nHe paused at a low exclamation from Smith. The engineer's eyes were\nfixed, in wonder and excitement, upon that part of the valley which lay\nat the joint of the \"L\" below them. It was perhaps six miles across; and\nall over the comparatively smooth surface jutted dark projections.\nViewed through the glasses, they had a regular, uniform appearance.\n\n\"By Jove!\" ejaculated the doctor, almost in awe. He leaned forward and\nscrubbed the dead-light for the tenth time. All four men strained their\neyes to see.\n\nIt was the architect who broke the silence which followed. The other\nthree were content to let the thrill of the thing have its way with\nthem. Such a feeling had little weight with the expert in archeology.\n\n\"Well,\" he declared jubilantly in his boyish voice, \"either I eat my hat\nor that's a genuine, bona fide city!\"\n\nAs swiftly as an elevator drops, and as safely, the cube shot straight\ndownward. Every second the landscape narrowed and shrunk, leaving the\nremaining details larger, clearer, sharper. Bit by bit the amazing thing\nbelow them resolved itself into a real metropolis.\n\nWithin five minutes they were less than a mile above it. Smith threw on\nmore current, so that the descent stopped; and the cube hung motionless\nin space.\n\nFor another five minutes the four men studied the scene in nervous\nsilence. Each knew that the others were looking for the same thing--some\nsign of life. A little spot of green, or possibly something in motion--a\nsingle whiff of smoke would have been enough to cause a whoop of joy.\n\nBut nobody shouted. There was nothing to shout about. Nowhere in all\nthat locality apparently was there the slightest indication that any\nsave themselves were alive.\n\nInstead, the most extraordinary city that man had ever laid eyes upon\nwas stretched directly beneath. It was grouped about what seemed to be\nthe meeting-point of three great roads, which led to this spot from as\nmany passes through the surrounding hills. And the city seemed thus\nnaturally divided into three segments, of equal size and shape, and each\nwith its own street system.\n\nFor they undoubtedly were streets. No metropolis on earth ever had its\nblocks laid out with such unvarying exactness. This Mercurian city\ncontained none but perfect equilateral triangles, and the streets\nthemselves were of absolutely uniform width.\n\nThe buildings, however, showed no such uniformity. On the outskirts of\nthis brilliantly tan mystery the blocks seemed to contain nothing save\nodd heaps of dingy, sun-baked mud. On the extreme north, however, lay\nfive blocks grouped together, whose buildings, like those in the middle\nof the city, were rather tall, square-cut and of the same dusty, cream-\nwhite hue.\n\n\"Down-town\" were several structures especially prominent for their\nheight. They towered to such an extent, in fact, that their upper\nwindows were easily made out. Apparently they were hundreds of stories\nhigh!\n\nHere and there on the streets could be seen small spots, colored a\ndarker buff than the rest of that dazzling landscape. But not one of the\nspots was moving.\n\n\"We'll go down further,\" said the engineer tentatively, in a low tone.\nThere was no comment. He gradually reduced the repelling current, so\nthat the sky-car resumed its descent.\n\nThey sank down until they were on a level with the top of one of those\nextraordinary sky-scrapers. The roof seemed perfectly flat, except for a\nlarge, round, black opening in its center. No one was in sight.\n\nWhen opposite the upper row of windows, at a distance of perhaps twenty\nfeet, Smith brought the car to a halt, and they peered in. There were no\npanes; the windows opened directly into a vast room; but nothing was\nclearly visible in the blackness save the outlines of the opening in the\nopposite walls.\n\nThey went down further, keeping well to the middle of the space above\nthe street. At every other yard they kept a sharp lookout for the\ninhabitants; but so far as they could see, their approach was entirely\nunobserved.\n\nWhen within fifty yards of the surface, all four men made a search for\ncross-wires below. They saw none; there were no poles, even. Neither, to\ntheir astonishment, was there such a thing as a sidewalk. The street\nstretched, unbroken by curbing, from wall to wall and from corner to\ncorner.\n\nAs the cube settled slowly to the ground, the adventurers left the\ndeadlight to use the windows. For a moment the view was obscured by a\nswirl of dust, raised by the spurt of the current; then this cloud\nvanished, settling to the ground with astounding suddenness, as though\njerked down by some invisible hand.\n\nDirectly ahead of them, distant perhaps a hundred yards, lay a\nyellowish-brown mass of unusual octagonal shape. One end contained a\nsmall oval opening, but the men from the Earth looked in vain for any\ncreature to emerge from it.\n\nThe doctor silently set to work with his apparatus. From an air-tight\ndouble-doored compartment he obtained a sample of the ether outside the\ncar; and with the aid of previously arranged chemicals, quickly learned\nthe truth.\n\nThere was no air. Not only was there no oxygen, the element upon which\nall known life depends, but there was no nitrogen, no carbon dioxide;\nnot the slightest trace of water vapor or of the other less known\nelements which can be found in small amounts in our own atmosphere.\nClearly, as the doctor said, whatever air the astronomers had observed\nmust exist on the circumference of the planet only, and not in this sun-\nblasted, north-central spot.\n\nOn the outer walls of the cube, so arranged as to be visible through the\nwindows, were various instruments. The barometer showed no pressure. The\nthermometer, a specially devised one which used gas instead of mercury,\nshowed a temperature of six hundred degrees, Fahrenheit.\n\nNo air, no water, and a baking heat; as the geologist remarked, how\ncould life exist there? But the architect suggested that possibly there\nwas some form of life, of which men knew nothing, which could exist\nunder such circumstances.\n\nThey got out three of the suits. These were a good deal like those worn\nby divers, except that the outer layer was made of non-conducting\naluminum cloth, flexible, air-tight, and strong. Between it and the\ninner lining was a layer of cells, into which the men now pumped several\npints of liquid oxygen. The terrific cold of this chemical made the\nheavy flannel of the inner lining very welcome; while the oxygen itself,\nas fast as it evaporated, revitalized the air within the big, glass-\nfaced helmet.\n\nOnce safely locked within the clumsy suits, Jackson, Van Emmon, and\nSmith took their places within the vestibule; while the doctor, who had\nvolunteered to stay behind, watched them open the outer door. With a\nhiss all the air in the vestibule rushed out; and the doctor earnestly\nthanked his stars that the inner door had been built very strongly.\n\nThe men stepped out on to the ground. At first they moved with great\ncare, being uncertain that their feet were weighted heavily enough to\ncounteract the reduced gravitation of the tiny planet. But they had been\nliving in a very peculiar condition, gravitationally speaking, for the\npast three days; and they quickly adapted themselves. After a little\nshifting about, the three artificial monsters gave their telephone wires\nanother scrutiny; then, keeping always within ten feet of each other, so\nas not to throw any strain on the connections, they strode in a matter-\nof-fact way toward the nearest doorway.\n\nFor a moment or two they stood outside the queer, peaked archway, their\nglimmering suits standing out oddly in the blinding sunlight. Then they\nadvanced boldly into the opening; in a flash they vanished from the\ndoctor's sight, and the inklike blackness of the opening again stared at\nhim from that dazzling wall.\n\n\n\nIII\n\nTHE HOUSE OF DUST\n\n\nThe geologist, strong man that he was, and by profession an investigator\nof the unknown--Van Emmon--took the lead. He stalked straight ahead into\na vast space which, without any preliminary hallway, filled the entire\ntriangular block.\n\nBefore their eyes were accustomed to the shadow--\"Pretty cold,\" murmured\nthe architect into the phone transmitter; it was fastened to the inside\nof the helmet, directly in front of his mouth, while the receiver was\nplaced beside his ear. All three stopped short to adjust each other's\nelectrical heating apparatus. To do this, they did not use their fingers\ndirectly; they manipulated ingenious non-magnetic pliers attached to the\nends of fingerless, insulated mittens.\n\nBefore they had finished, the builder, who had been puzzling over the\nextraordinary suddenness with which that cloud of dust had settled,\nreceived an inspiration. He was carrying note-book and camera. With his\npliers he tore out a sheet from the former, and holding book in one hand\nand the leaf in the other, he allowed them to drop at the same instant.\n\nThey reached the ground together.\n\n\"See?\" The architect repeated the experiment. \"Back home, where there's\nair, the paper would have floated down; it would have taken three times\nas long for it to fall as the book.\"\n\nSmith nodded, but he had been thinking of something else. He said\ngravely: \"Remember what I told you--it's air that insulates the earth\nfrom the ether. If there's no air here--\" he glanced out into the\npitiless sunlight--\"then I hope there's no flaw in our insulation. We're\nwalking in an electrical bath.\"\n\nThey looked around. Objects were pretty distinct now. They could easily\nsee that the floor was covered with what appeared to be machines, laid\nout in orderly fashion. Here, however, as outside, everything was coated\nwith that fine, cream-colored dust. It filled every nook and cranny; it\nstirred about their feet with every step.\n\nThe geologist led the way down a broad aisle, on either side of which\ntowered immense machinery. Smith was for stopping to examine them one by\none; but the others vetoed the engineer's passion, and strode on toward\nthe end of the triangle. More than anything else, they looked for the\nabsent population to show itself.\n\nSuddenly Van Emmon stopped short. \"Is it possible that they're all\nasleep?\" He added that, even though the sun shone steadily the year\naround, the people must take time for rest.\n\nBut Smith stirred the dust with his foot and shook his head. \"I've seen\nno tracks. This dust has been lying here for weeks, perhaps months. If\nthe folks are away, then they must be taking a community vacation.\"\n\nAt the end of the aisle they reached a small, railed-in space, strongly\nresembling what might be seen in any office on the earth. In the middle\nof it stood a low, flat-topped desk, for all the world like that of a\nprosperous real-estate agent, except that it was about half a foot\nlower. There was no chair. For lack of a visible gate in the railing,\nthe explorers stepped over, being careful not to touch it.\n\nThere was nothing on top of the desk save the usual coat of dust. Below,\na very wide space had been left for the legs of whoever had used it; and\nflanking this space were two pedestals, containing what looked to be a\nmultitude of exceedingly small drawers. Smith bent and examined them;\napparently they had no locks; and he unhesitatingly reached out, gripped\nthe knob of one and pulled.\n\nNoiselessly, instantaneously, the whole desk crumbled to powder.\nStartled, Smith stumbled backwards, knocking against the railing. Next\ninstant it lay on the floor, its fragments scarcely distinguishable from\nwhat had already covered the surface. Only a tiny cloud of dust arose,\nand in half a second this had settled.\n\nThe three looked at each other significantly. Clearly, the thing that\nhad just happened argued a great lapse of time since the user of that\ndesk officiated in that enclosure. It looked as though Smith's guess of\n\"weeks, perhaps months,\" would have to be changed to years, perhaps\ncenturies.\n\n\"Feel all right?\" asked the geologist. Jackson and Smith made\naffirmative noises; and again they stepped out, this time walking in the\naisle along the outer wall. They could see their sky-car plainly through\nthe ovals.\n\nHere the machinery could be examined more closely. They resembled\nautomatic testing scales, said Smith; such as is used in weighing\ncomplicated metal products after finishing and assembling. Moreover,\nthey seemed to be connected, the one to the other, with a series of\nendless belts, which Smith thought indicated automatic production. To\nall appearances, the dust-covered apparatus stood just as it had been\nleft when operations ceased, an unguessable length of time before.\n\nSmith showed no desire to touch the things now. Seeing this, the\ngeologist deliberately reached out and scraped the dust from the nearest\nmachine; and to the vast relief of all three, no damage was done. The\ndust fell straight to the floor, exposing a brilliantly polished streak\nof greenish-white metal.\n\nVan Emmon made another tentative brush or so at other points, with the\nsame result. Clean, untarnished metal lay beneath all that dust. Clearly\nit was some non-conducting alloy; whatever it was, it had successfully\nresisted the action of the elements all the while that such presumably\nwooden articles as the desk and railing had been steadily rotting.\n\nEmboldened, Smith clambered up on the frame of one of the machines. He\nexamined it closely as to its cams, clutches, gearing, and other details\nsignificant enough to his mechanical training. He noted their\nadjustments, scrutinized the conveying apparatus, and came back carrying\na cylindrical object which he had removed from an automatic chuck.\n\n\"This is what they were making,\" he remarked, trying to conceal his\nexcitement. The others brushed the dust from the thing, a huge piece of\nmetal which would have been too much for their strength on the earth.\nInstantly they identified it.\n\nIt was a cannon shell.\n\nAgain Van Emmon led the way. They took a reassuring glance out the\nwindow at the familiar cube, then passed along the aisle toward the\nfarther corner. As they neared it they saw that it contained a small\nenclosure of heavy metal scrollwork, within which stood a triangular\nelevator.\n\nThe men examined it as closely as possible, noting especially the\nextremely low stool which stood upon its platform. The same unerodable\nmetal seemed to have been used throughout the whole affair.\n\nAfter a careful scrutiny of the two levers which appeared to control the\nthing--\"I'm going to try it out,\" announced Smith, well knowing that the\nothers would have to go with him if they kept the telephones intact.\nThey protested that the thing was not safe; Smith replied that they had\nseen no stairway, or anything corresponding to one. \"If this lift is\nmade of that alloy,\" admiringly, \"then it's safe.\" But Jackson managed\nto talk him out of it.\n\nWhen they returned to the heap of powdered wood which had been the desk,\nSmith spied a long work-bench under a nearby window. There they found a\nvery ordinary vise, in which was clamped a piece of metal; but for the\ndust, it might have been placed there ten minutes before. On the bench\nlay several tools, some familiar to the engineer and some entirely\nstrange. A set of screw-drivers of various sizes caught his eye. He\npicked them up, and again experienced the sensation of having wood turn\nto dust at his touch. The blades were whole.\n\nStill searching, the engineer found a square metal chest of drawers,\neach of which he promptly opened. The contents were laden with dust, but\nhe brushed this off and disclosed a quantity of exceedingly delicate\ninstruments. They were more like dentists' tools than machinists', yet\nplainly were intended for mechanical use.\n\nOne drawer held what appeared to be a roll of drawings. Smith did not\nwant to touch them; with infinite care he blew off the dust with the aid\nof his oxygen pipe. After a moment or two the surface was clear, but it\noffered no encouragement; it was the blank side of the paper.\n\nThere was no help for it. Smith grasped the roll firmly with his pliers\n--and next second gazed upon dust.\n\nIn the bottom drawer lay something that aroused the curiosity of all\nthree. These were small reels, about two inches in diameter and a\nquarter of an inch thick, each incased in a tight-fitting box. They\nresembled measuring tapes to some extent, except that the ribbons were\nmade of marvelously thin material. Van Emmon guessed that there were a\nhundred yards in a roll. Smith estimated it at three hundred. They\nseemed to be made of a metal similar to that composing the machines.\nSmith pocketed them all.\n\nIt was the builder who thought to look under the bench, but it was Smith\nwho had brought a light. By its aid they discovered a very small\nmachine, decidedly like a stock ticker, except that it had no glass\ndome, but possessed at one end a curious metal disk about a foot in\ndiameter. Apparently it had been undergoing repairs; it was impossible\nto guess its purpose. Smith's pride was instantly aroused; he tucked it\nunder his arm, and was impatient to get back to the cube, where he might\nmore carefully examine his find with the tips of his fingers.\n\nIt was when they were about to leave the building that they thought to\ninspect walls and ceiling. Not that anything worth while was to be seen;\nthe surfaces seemed perfectly plain and bare, except for the inevitable\ndust. Even the uppermost corners, ten feet above their heads, showed\ndust to the light of Smith's electric torch.\n\nVan Emmon stopped and stared at the spot as though fascinated. The\nothers were ready to go; they turned and looked at him curiously. For a\nmoment or two he seemed struggling for breath.\n\n\"Good Heavens!\" he gasped, almost in a whisper. His face was white; the\nother two leaped toward him, fearful that he was suffocating. But he\npushed them away roughly.\n\n\"We're fools! Blind, blithering idiots--that's what we are!\" He pointed\ntoward the ceiling with a hand that trembled plainly, and went on in a\nvoice which he tried to make fierce despite the awe which shook it.\n\n\"Look at that dust again! How'd it get there?\" He paused while the\nothers, the thought finally getting to them, felt a queer chill striking\nat the backs of their necks. \"Men--there's only one way for the dust to\nsettle on a wall! It's got to have air to carry it! It couldn't possibly\nget there without air!\n\n\"That dust settled long before life appeared on the Earth, even! It's\nbeen there ever since the air disappeared from Mercury!\"\n\n\n\nIV\n\nTHE LIBRARY\n\n\n\"I thought you'd never get back,\" complained the doctor crossly, when\nthe three entered. They had been gone just half an hour.\n\nNext moment he was studying their faces, and at once he demanded the\nmost important fact. They told him, and before they had finished he was\nhalf-way into another suit. He was all eagerness; but somehow the three\nwere very glad to be inside the cube again, and firmly insisted upon\nmoving to another spot before making further explorations.\n\nWithin a minute or two the cube was hovering opposite the upper floor of\nthe building the three had entered; and with only a foot of space\nseparating the window of the sky-car and the dust-covered wall, the men\nfrom the earth inspected the interior at considerable length. They\nflashed a search-light all about the place, and concluded that it was\nthe receiving-room, where the raw iron billets were brought via the\nelevator, and from there slid to the floor below. At one end, in exactly\nthe same location as the desk Smith had destroyed, stood another, with a\nlow and remarkably broad chair beside it.\n\nSo far as could be seen, there were neither doors, window-panes, nor\nshutters through the structure. \"To get all the light and air they\ncould,\" guessed the doctor. \"Perhaps that's why the buildings are all\ntriangular; most wall surface in proportion to floor area, that way.\"\n\nA few hundred feet higher they began to look for prominent buildings.\nOnly in forgetful moments did either of them scan the landscape for\nsigns of life; they knew now that there could be none.\n\n\"We ought to learn something there,\" the doctor said after a while,\npointing out a particularly large, squat, irregularly built affair on\nthe edge of the \"business district.\" The architect, however, was in\nfavor of an exceptionally large, high building in the isolated group\npreviously noted in the \"suburbs.\" But because it was nearer, they\nmaneuvered first in the direction of the doctor's choice.\n\nThe sky-car came to rest in a large plaza opposite what appeared to be\nthe structure's main entrance. From their window the explorers saw that\nthe squat effect was due only to the space the edifice covered; for it\nwas an edifice, a full five stories high.\n\nThe doctor was impatient to go. Smith was willing enough to stay behind;\nhe was already joyously examining the strange machine he had found. Two\nminutes later Kinney, Van Emmon, and Jackson were standing before the\nportals of the great building.\n\nThere they halted, and no wonder. The entire face of the building could\nnow be seen to be covered with a mass of carvings; for the most part\nthey were statues in bas relief. All were fantastic in the extreme, but\nwhether purposely so or not, there was no way to tell. Certainly any\nsuch work on the part of an earthly artist would have branded him either\nas insane or as an incomprehensible genius.\n\nDirectly above the entrance was a group which might have been labeled,\n\"The Triumph of the Brute.\" An enormously powerful man, nearly as broad\nas he was tall, stood exulting over his victim, a less robust figure,\nprostrate under his feet. Both were clad in armor. The victor's face was\ndistorted into a savage snarl, startlingly hideous by reason of the\nprodigious size of his head, planted as it was directly upon his\nshoulders; for he had no neck. His eyes were set so close together that\nat first glance they seemed to be but one. His nose was flat and African\nin type, while his mouth, devoid of curves, was simply revolting in its\nhuge, thick-lipped lack of proportion. His chin was square and\naggressive; his forehead, strangely enough, extremely high and narrow,\nrather than low and broad.\n\nHis victim lay in an attitude that indicated the most agonizing torture;\nhis head was bent completely back, and around behind his shoulders. On\nthe ground lay two battle-axes, huge affairs almost as heavy as the\nmassively muscled men who had used them.\n\nBut the eyes of the explorers kept coming back to the fearsome face of\nthe conqueror. From the brows down, he was simply a huge, brutal giant;\nabove his eyes, he was an intellectual. The combination was absolutely\nfrightful; the beast looked capable of anything, of overcoming any\nobstacle, mental or physical, internal or external, in order to assert\nhis apparently enormous will. He could control himself or dominate\nothers with equal ease and assurance.\n\n\"It can't be that he was drawn from life,\" said the doctor, with an\neffort. It wasn't easy to criticize that figure, lifeless though it was.\n\"On a planet like this, with such slight gravitation, there is no need\nfor such huge strength. The typical Mercurian should be tall and flimsy\nin build, rather than short and compact.\"\n\nBut the geologist differed. \"We want to remember that the earth has no\nstandard type. Think what a difference there is between the mosquito and\nthe elephant, the snake and the spider! One would suppose that they had\nbeen developed under totally different planetary conditions, instead of\nall right on the same globe.\n\n\"No; I think this monster may have been genuine.\" And with that the\ngeologist turned to examine the other statuary.\n\nWithout exception, it resembled the central group; all the figures were\nneckless, and all much more heavily built than any people on earth.\nThere were several female figures; they had the same general build, and\nin every case were so placed as to enhance the glory of the males. In\none group the woman was offering up food and drink to a resting worker;\nin another she was being carried off, struggling, in the arms of a\nfairly good-looking warrior.\n\nDr. Kinney led the way into the building. As in the other structure,\nthere was no door. The space seemed to be but one story in height,\nalthough that had the effect of a cathedral. The whole of the ceiling,\nirregularly arched in a curious, pointed manner, was ornamented with\ngrotesque figures; while the walls were also partially formed of squat,\nsemi-human statues, set upon huge, triangular shafts. In the spaces\nbetween these outlandish pilasters there had once been some sort of\ndecorations, A great many photos were taken here.\n\nAs for the floor, it was divided in all directions by low walls. About\nfive and a half feet in height, these walls separated the great room\ninto perhaps a hundred triangular compartments, each about the size of\nan ordinary living room. Broad openings, about five feet square,\nprovided free access from one compartment to any other. The men from the\nearth, by standing on tiptoes, could see over and beyond this system.\n\n\"Wonder if these walls were supposed to cut off the view?\" speculated\nthe doctor. \"I mean, do you suppose that the Mercurians were such short\npeople as that?\" His question had to go unanswered.\n\nThey stepped into the nearest compartment, and were on the point of\npronouncing it bare, when Jackson, with an exclamation, excitedly\nbrushed away some of the dust and showed that the presumably solid walls\nwere really chests of drawers. Shallow things of that peculiar metal,\nthese drawers numbered several hundred to the compartment. In the whole\nbuilding there must have been millions.\n\nOnce more the dust was carefully removed, revealing a layer of those\ncurious rolls or reels, exactly similar to what had been found in the\ntool chest in the shell works. A careful examination of the metallic\ntape showed nothing whatever to the naked eye, although the doctor\nfancied that he made out some strange characters on the little boxes\nthemselves.\n\nHis view was shortly proved. Finding drawer after drawer to contain a\nsimilar display, varying from one to a dozen of the diminutive ribbons,\nVan Emmon adopted the plan of gently blowing away the dust from the\nfaces of the drawers before opening them. This revealed the fact that\neach of the shallow things was neatly labeled!\n\nInstantly the three were intent upon this fresh clue. The markings were\nvery faint and delicate, the slightest touch being enough to destroy\nthem. To the untrained eye, they resembled ancient Egyptian\nhieroglyphics; to the archeologist, they meant that a brand-new system\nof ideographs had been found.\n\nSuddenly Jackson straightened up and looked about with a new interest.\nHe went to one of the square doorways and very carefully removed the\ndust from a small plate on the lintel. He need not have been so careful;\nengraved in the solid metal was a single character, plainly in the same\nlanguage as the other ideographs.\n\nThe architect smiled triumphantly into the inquiring eyes of his\nfriends. \"I won't have to eat my hat,\" said he. \"This is a sure-enough\ncity, all right, and this is its library!\"\n\nSmith was still busy on the little machine when they returned to the\ncube. He said that one part of it had disappeared, and was busily\nengaged in filing a bit of steel to take its place. As soon as it was\nready, he thought, they could see what the apparatus meant.\n\nThe three had brought a large number of the reels. They were confident\nthat a microscopic search of the ribbons would disclose something to\nbear out Jackson's theory that the great structure was really a\nrepository for books, or whatever corresponded with books on Mercury.\n\n\"But the main thing,\" said the doctor, enthusiastically, \"is to get over\nto the 'twilight band.' I'm beginning to have all sorts of wild hopes.\"\n\nJackson urged that they first visit the big \"mansion\" on the outskirts\nof this place; he said he felt sure, somehow, that it would be worth\nwhile. But Van Emmon backed up the doctor, and the architect had to be\ncontent with an agreement to return in case their trip was futile.\n\nInside of a few minutes the cube was being drawn steadily over toward\nthe left or western edge of the planet's sunlit face. As it moved, all\nexcept Smith kept close watch on the ground below. They made out town\nafter town, as well as separate buildings; and on the roads were to be\nseen a great many of those octagonal structures, all motionless.\n\nAfter several hundred miles of this, the surface abruptly sloped toward\nwhat had clearly been the bed of an ocean. No sign of habitations here,\nhowever; so apparently the water had disappeared AFTER the humans had\ngone.\n\nThis ancient sea ended a short distance from the district they were\nseeking. A little more travel brought them to a point where the sun cast\nas much shadow as light on the surface. It was here they descended,\ncoming to rest on a sunlit knoll which overlooked a small, building-\nfilled valley.\n\nAccording to Kinney's apparatus, there was about one-fortieth the amount\nof air that exists on the earth. Of water vapor there was a trace; but\nall their search revealed no human life. Not only that, but there was no\ntrace of lower animals; there was not even a lizard, much less a bird.\nAnd even the most ancient-looking of the sculptures showed no creatures\nof the air; only huge, antediluvian monsters were ever depicted.\n\nThey took a great many photos as a matter of course. Also, they\ninvestigated some of the big, octagonal machines in the streets, finding\nthem to be similar to the great \"tanks\" that were used in the war,\nexcept that they did not have the characteristic caterpillar tread;\ntheir eight faces were so linked together that the entire affair could\nroll, after a jolting, slab-sided, flopping fashion. Inside were curious\nengines, and sturdy machines designed to throw the cannon-shells they\nhad seen; no explosive was employed, apparently, but centrifugal force\ngenerated in whirling wheels. Apparently these cars, or chariots, were\nuniversally used.\n\nThe explorers returned to the cube, where they found that Smith,\nhappening to look out a window, had spied a pond not far off. The three\nvisited it and found, on its banks, the first green stuff they had seen;\na tiny, flowerless salt grass, very scarce. It bordered a slimy, bluish\npool of absolutely still fluid. Nobody would call it water. They took a\nfew samples of it and went back.\n\nAnd within a few minutes the doctor slid a small glass slide into his\nmicroscope, and examined the object with much satisfaction. What he saw\nwas a tiny, gelatinlike globule; among scientists it is known as the\namoeba. It is the simplest known form of life--the so-called \"single\ncell.\" It had been the first thing to live on that planet, and\napparently it was also the last.\n\n\n\nV\n\nTHE CLOSED DOOR\n\n\nAs they neared Jackson's pet \"mansion\" each man paid close attention to\nthe intervening blocks. For the most part these were simply shapeless\nruins; heaps of what had once been, perhaps, brick or stone. Once they\nallowed the cube to rest on the top of one of these mounds; but the sky-\ncar's great weight merely sank it into the mass. There was nothing under\nit save that same sandy dust.\n\nApparently the locality they were approaching had been set aside as a\nvery exclusive residence district for the elite of the country. Possibly\nit contained the homes of the royalty, assuming that there had been a\nroyalty. At any rate the conspicuous structure Jackson had selected was\ncertainly the home of the most important member of that colony.\n\nWhen the three, once more in their helmets and suits, stood before the\nlow, broad portico which protected the entrance to that edifice, the\nfirst thing they made out was an ornamental frieze running across the\nface. In the same bold, realistic style as the other sculpture, there\nwas depicted a hand-to-hand battle between two groups of those half\nsavage, half cultured monstrosities. And in the background was shown a\nglowing orb, obviously the sun.\n\n\"See that?\" exclaimed the doctor. \"The size of that sun, I mean! Compare\nit with the way old Sol looks now!\"\n\nThey took a single glance at the great ball of fire over their heads;\nnine times the size it always seemed at home, it contrasted sharply with\nthe rather small ball shown in the carvings.\n\n\"Understand?\" the doctor went on. \"When that sculpture was made, Mercury\nwas little nearer the sun than the earth is now!\"\n\nThe builder was hugely impressed. He asked, eagerly: \"Then probably the\npeople became as highly developed as we?\"\n\nVan Emmon nodded approvingly, but the doctor opposed. \"No; I think not,\nJackson. Mercury never did have as much air as the earth, and\nconsequently had much less oxygen. And the struggle for existence,\" he\nwent on, watching to see if the geologist approved each point as he made\nit, \"the struggle for life is, in the last analysis, a struggle for\noxygen.\n\n\"So I would say that life was a pretty strenuous proposition here, while\nit lasted. Perhaps they were--\" He stopped, then added: \"What I can't\nunderstand is, how did it happen that their affairs came to such an\nabrupt end? And why don't we see any--er--indications?\"\n\n\"Skeletons?\" The architect shuddered. Next second, though, his face lit\nup with a thought. \"I remember reading that electricity will decompose\nbone, in time.\" And then he shuddered again as his foot stirred that\nlifeless, impalpable dust. Was it possible?\n\nAs they passed into the great house the first thing they noted was the\nfloor, undivided, dust-covered, and bare, except for what had perhaps\nbeen rugs. The shape was the inevitable equilateral triangle; and here,\nwith a certain magnificent disregard for precedent, the builders had\ndone away with a ceiling entirely, and instead had sloped the three\nwalls up till they met in a single point, a hundred feet overhead. The\neffect was massively simple.\n\nIn one corner a section of the floor was elevated perhaps three feet\nabove the rest, and directly back of this was a broad doorway, set in a\nshort wall. The three advanced at once toward it.\n\nHere the electric torch came in very handy. It disclosed a poorly\nlighted stairway, very broad, unrailed, and preposterously steep. The\nsteps were each over three feet high.\n\n\"Difference in gravitation,\" said the doctor, in response to Jackson's\nquestioning look. \"Easy enough for the old-timers, perhaps.\" They\nstruggled up the flight as best they could, reaching the top after over\nfive minutes of climbing.\n\nPerhaps it was the reaction from this exertion; at all events each felt\na distinct loss of confidence as, after regaining their wind, they again\nbegan to explore. Neither said anything about it to the others; but each\nnoted a queer sense of foreboding, far more disquieting than either of\nthem had felt when investigating anything else. It may have been due to\nthe fact that, in their hurry, they had not stopped to eat.\n\nThe floor they were on was fairly well lighted with the usual oval\nwindows. The space was open, except that it contained the same kind of\ndividing walls they had found in the library. Here, however, each\ncompartment contained but one opening, and that not uniformly placed. In\nfact, as the three noted with a growing uneasiness, it was necessary to\npass through every one of them in order to reach the corner farthest,\nfrom the ladderlike stairs. Why it should make them uneasy, neither\ncould have said.\n\nWhen they were almost through the labyrinth, Van Emmon, after standing\non tiptoes for the tenth time, in order to locate himself, noted\nsomething that had escaped their attention before. \"These compartments\nused to be covered over,\" he said, for some reason lowering his voice.\nHe pointed out niches in the walls, such as undoubtedly once held the\nends of heavy timbers. \"What was this place, anyhow? A trap?\"\n\nUnconsciously they lightened their steps as they neared the last\ncompartment. They found, as expected, that it was another stairwell. Van\nEmmon turned the light upon every corner of the place before going any\nfurther; but except for a formless heap of rubbish in one corner, which\nthey did not investigate, the place was as bare as the rest of the\nfloor.\n\nAgain they climbed, this time for a much shorter distance; but Jackson,\nslightly built chap that he was, needed a little help on the steep\nstairs. They were not sorry that they had reached the uppermost floor of\nthe mansion. It was somewhat better lighted than the floor below, and\nthey were relieved to find that the triangular compartments did not have\nthe significant niches in their walls. Their spirits rose perceptibly.\n\nAt the corner farthest from the stairs one of the walls rose straight to\nthe ceiling, completely cutting off a rather large triangle. The three\npaid no attention to the other compartments, but went straight to what\nthey felt sure was the most vital spot in the place. And their feelings\nwere justified with a vengeance when they saw that the usual doorway in\nthis wall was protected by something that had, so far, been entirely\nmissing everywhere else.\n\nIt was barred by a heavy door.\n\nFor several minutes the doctor, the geologist, and the architect stood\nbefore it. Neither would have liked to admit that he would just as soon\nleave that door unopened. All the former uneasiness came back. It was\nall the more inexplicable, with the brilliant sunlight only a few feet\naway, that each should have felt chilled by the place.\n\n\"Wonder if it's locked?\" remarked Van Emmon. He pressed against the\ndust-covered barrier, half expecting it to turn to dust; but evidently\nit had been made of the time-defying alloy. It stood firm. And to all\nappearances it was nearly air-tight.\n\n\"Well!\" said the doctor suddenly, so that the other two started\nnervously. \"The door's got to come down; that's all!\" They looked\naround; there was no furniture, no loose piece of material of any kind.\nVan Emmon straightway backed away from the door about six feet, and the\nothers followed his example.\n\n\"All together!\" grunted the geologist; and the three aluminum-armored\nmonsters charged the door. It shook under the impact; a shower of dust\nfell down; and they saw that they had loosened the thing.\n\n\"Once more!\" This time a wide crack showed all around the edge of the\ndoor, and the third attempt finished the job. Noiselessly--for there was\nno air to carry the sound--but with a heavy jar which all three felt\nthrough their feet, the barrier went flat on the floor beyond.\n\nAt the same instant a curious, invisible wave, like a tiny puff of wind,\nfloated out of the darkness and passed by the three men from the earth.\nEach noticed it, but neither mentioned it at the time. Van Emmon was\nalready searching the darkness with the torch.\n\nApparently it was only an anteroom. A few feet beyond was another wall,\nand in it stood another door, larger and heavier than the first. The\nthree did not stop; they immediately tried their strength on this one\nalso.\n\nAfter a half dozen attempts without so much as shaking the massive\naffair--\"It's no use,\" panted the geologist, wishing that he could get a\nhandkerchief to his forehead. \"We can't loosen it without tools.\"\n\nJackson was for trying again, but the doctor agreed with Van Emmon. They\nreflected that they had been away from Smith long enough, anyhow. The\ncube was out of sight from where they were.\n\nVan Emmon turned the light on the walls of the anteroom, and found, on a\nshelf at one end, a neat pile of those little reels, eleven in all. He\npocketed the lot. There was nothing else.\n\nJackson and Kinney started to go. They retreated as far into the main\nroom as their telephone wires would allow. Still the geologist held\nback.\n\n\"Come on,\" said the doctor uneasily. \"It's getting cold.\"\n\nNext second they stopped short, nerves on edge, at a strange exclamation\nfrom Van Emmon. They looked around to see him pointing his light\ndirectly at the floor. Even in that unnatural suit of mail, his attitude\nwas one of horror.\n\n\"Look here,\" he said in a low, strained voice. They went to his side,\nand instinctively glanced behind them before looking at what lay in the\ndust.\n\nIt was the imprint of an enormous human foot.\n\n\nThe first thing that greeted the ears of the explorers upon taking off\ntheir suits in the sky-car, was the exultant voice of Smith. He was too\nexcited to notice anything out of the way in their manner; he was almost\ndancing in front of his bench, where the unknown machine, now\nreconstructed, stood belted to a small electric-motor.\n\n\"It runs!\" he was shouting. \"You got here just in time!\" He began to\nfumble with a switch.\n\n\"What of it?\" remarked the doctor in the bland tone which he kept for\noccasions when Smith needed calming. \"What will it do if it does run?\"\n\nThe engineer looked blank. \"Why--\" Then he remembered, and picked up one\nof the reels at random. \"There's a clamp here just the right size to\nhold one of these,\" he explained, fitting the ribbon into place and\nthreading its free end into a loop on a spool which looked as though\nmade for it. But his excitement had passed; he now cautiously set a\nsmall anvil between himself and the apparatus, and then, with the aid of\na long stick, he threw on the current.\n\nFor a moment nothing happened, save the hum of the motor. Then a\nstrange, leafy rustling sounded from the mechanism, and next, without\nany warning, a high-pitched voice, nasal and plaintive but distinctly\nhuman, spoke from the big metal disk.\n\nThe words were unintelligible. The language was totally unlike anything\never heard on the earth. And yet, deliberately if somewhat cringingly,\nthe voice proceeded with what was apparently a recitation. There were\nmodulations, pauses, sentences; but seemingly the paragraphs were all\nshort and to the point.\n\nAs the thing went on the four men came closer and watched the operation\nof the machine. The ribbon unrolled slowly; it was plain that, if the\none topic occupied the whole reel, then it must have the length of an\nordinary chapter. And as the voice continued, certain dramatic qualities\ncame out and governed the words, utterly incomprehensible though they\nwere. There was a real thrill to it.\n\nAfter a while they stopped the thing. \"No use listening to this now,\" as\nthe doctor said. \"We've got to learn a good deal more about these people\nbefore we can guess what it all means.\"\n\nAnd yet, although all were very hungry, on Jackson's suggestion they\ntried out one of the \"records\" that was brought from that baffling\nanteroom. Smith was very much interested in that unopened door, and Van\nEmmon was in the midst of it when Jackson started the motor.\n\nThe geologist's words stuck in his throat. The disk was actually shaking\nwith the vibrations of a most terrific voice. Prodigiously loud and\npowerful, its booming, resonant bass smote the ears like the roll of\nthunder. It was irresistible in its force, compelling in its assurance,\nmasterful and strong to an overpowering degree. Involuntarily the men\nfrom the earth stepped back.\n\nOn it roared and rumbled, speaking the same language as that of the\nother record; but whereas the first speaker merely USED the words, the\nlast speaker demolished them. One felt that he had extracted every ounce\nof power in the language, leaving it weak and flabby, unfit for further\nuse. He threw out his sentences as though done with them; not boldly,\nnot defiantly, least of all, tentatively, he spoke with a certainty and\nforce that came from a knowledge that he could compel, rather than\ninduce his hearers to believe.\n\nIt took a little nerve to shut him off; Van Emmon was the one who did\nit. Somehow they all felt immensely relieved when the gigantic voice was\nsilenced; and at once began discussing the thing with great earnestness.\nJackson was for assuming that the first record was worn and old, the\nlast one, fresh and new; but after examining both tapes under a glass,\nand seeing how equally clear cut and sharp the impressions all were,\nthey agreed that the extraordinary voice they had heard was practically\ntrue to life.\n\nThey tried out the rest of the records in that batch, finding that they\nwere all by the same speaker. Nowhere among the ribbons brought from the\nlibrary was another of his making, although a great number of different\nvoices was included; neither was there another talker with a fifth the\nvolume, the resonance, the absolute power of conviction that this\nunknown colossus possessed.\n\nOf course this is no place to describe the laborious process of\ninterpreting these documents, records of a past which was gone before\nearth's mankind had even begun. The work involved the study of countless\nphotos, covering everything from inscriptions to parts of machinery, and\nother details which furnished clue after clue to that superancient\nlanguage. It was not deciphered, in fact, until several years after the\nexplorers had submitted their finds to the world's foremost\nlexicographers, antiquarians and paleontologists. Even today some of it\nis disputed.\n\nBut right here is, most emphatically, the place to insert the tale told\nby that unparalleled voice. And incredible though it may seem, as judged\nby the standards of the peoples of this earth, the account is fairly\nproved by the facts uncovered by the expedition. It would be but begging\nthe question to doubt the genuineness of the thing; and if,\nunderstanding the language, one were to hear the original as it fell,\nword for word from the iron mouth of Strokor [Footnote: Translator's\nnote--In the Mercurian language, stroke means iron, or heart.] the\nGreat-hearing, one would believe; none could doubt, nor would.\n\nAnd so it does not do him justice to set it down in ordinary print. One\nmust imagine the story being related by Stentor himself; must conceive\nof each word falling like the blow of a mammoth sledge. The tale was not\ntold--it was BELLOWED; and this is how it ran:\n\n\n\nPART II\n\nTHE STORY\n\nI\n\nTHE MAN\n\n\nI am Strokor, son of Strok, the armorer. I am Strokor, a maker of tools\nof war; Strokor, the mightiest man in the world; Strokor, whose wisdom\noutwitted the hordes of Klow; Strokor, who has never feared, and never\nfailed. Let him who dares, dispute it. I--I am Strokor!\n\nIn my youth I was, as now, the marvel of all who saw. I was ever robust\nand daring, and naught but much older, bigger lads could outdo me. I\nbalked at nothing, be it a game or a battle; it was, and forever shall\nbe, my chief delight to best all others.\n\n'Twas from my mother that I gained my huge frame and sound heart. In\ntruth, I am very like her, now that I think upon it. She, too, was\nindomitable in battle, and famed for her liking for strife. No doubt\n'twas her stalwart figure that caught my father's fancy.\n\nAye, my mother was a very likely woman, but she boasted no brains. \"I\nneed no cunning,\" I remember she said; and he who was so unlucky in\nbattle as to fall into her hands could vouch for the truth of it--as\nlong as he lived, which would not be long. She was a grand woman, slow\nto anger and a match for many a good pair of men. Often, as a lad, have\nI carried the marks of her punishment for the most of a year.\n\nAnd thus it seems that I owe my head to my father. He was a marvelously\nclever man, dexterous with hand and brain alike. Moreover, he was no\nweakling; perchance I should credit him with some of my agility, for he\nwas famed as a gymnast, though not a powerful one. 'Twas he who taught\nme how to disable my enemy with a mere clutch of the neck at a certain\nspot.\n\nBut Strok, the armorer, was feared most because of his brain, and his\nknack of using his mind to the undoing of others. And he taught me all\nthat he knew; taught me all that he had learned in a lifetime of\nfighting for the emperor, of mending the complicated machines in the\narmory, of contact with the chemists who wrought the secret alloy, and\nthe chiefs who led the army.\n\nSome of this he taught me when I was not yet a man. Why he should have\ndone so, I know not, save that he seemed to value my affection, and\nliked not my mother's demands that I heed her call, not his. At all\nevents, I oft found his shop a place of refuge from her wrath; and I\nearly came to value his teachings.\n\nWhen I became a man he abruptly ended the practice. I think he saw that\nI was become as dexterous as he with the tools of the craft, and he\nfeared lest I know more than he. Well he might; the day I realized this\nI laughed long and loud. And from that time forth he taught me, not\nbecause he chose to, but because I bent a chisel in my bare hands,\nbefore his eyes, and told him his place.\n\nMany times he strove to trick me, and more than once he all but caught\nme in some trap. He was a crafty man, and relied not upon brawn, but\nupon wits. Yet I was ever on the watch, and I but learned the more from\nhim.\n\n\"Ye are very kind,\" I mocked him one morning. When I had taken my seat a\nhuge weight had dropped from above and crushed my stool to splinters,\nmuch as it would have crushed my skull had I not leaped instantly aside.\n\"Ye are kinder than most fathers, who teach their sons nothing at all.\"\n\nHe foamed at his mouth in his rage and discomfiture. \"Insolent whelp!\"\nhe snarled. \"Thou art quick as a cat on thy feet!\"\n\nBut I was not to be appeased by words. I smote him on the chest with my\nbare hand, so that he fell on the far side of the room. \"Let that be a\nwarning,\" I told him, when he had recovered, some time later. \"If ye\nhave any more tricks, try them for, not on, me.\" Which I claim to be a\nneat twist of words.\n\nIt was not long after that when I saw a change in my father. He no\nlonger tried to snare me; instead, he began, of his own free will, to\ntrain my mind to other than warlike things. At first, I was suspicious\nenough. I looked for new traps, and watched all the closer. I told him\nthat his next try would surely be his last, and I meant it.\n\nBut the time came when I saw that my father was reconciled to his\nmaster. I saw that he genuinely admitted my prowess; and where he\nformerly envied me, he now took great pride in all I accomplished, and\nclaimed that it was but his own brains acting through my body.\n\nI let him indulge in the conceit. I grudged it not to him, so long as he\ntaught me. In truth, he was so eager to add to my store of facts, so\nintent upon filling my head with what filled his, that at times I was\nfairly compelled to stop him, lest I tire.\n\nMy mother opposed all this. \"The lad needs none of thy wiles,\" she\ngibed. \"He is no stripling; he is a man's man, and a fit son of his\nmother.\"\n\n\"Aye,\" quoth my father slyly. \"He has thy muscle and thy courage. Thank\nJon, he hath not thy empty head!\"\n\nWhereat she flew at him. Had she caught him, she would have destroyed\nhim, such was her rage; and afterwards she would have mourned her folly\nand mayhap have injured herself; for she loved him greatly. But he\nstepped aside just in the nick of time, and she crashed into the wall\nbehind him with such force that she was senseless for a time. I remember\nit well.\n\nAnd yet, to give credit where credit is due, I must admit that I owe a\ngreat deal to that gray-beard, Maka, the star-gazer. But for him,\nperchance, the name of Strokor would mean but little, for 'twas he who\ngave me ambition.\n\nTruly it was an uncommon affair, my first meeting with him. Now that I\nshake my memory for it, it seems that something else of like consequence\ncame to pass on the same occasion. Curious; but I have not thought on it\nfor many days.\n\nYes, it is true; I met Maka on the very morn that I first laid eyes on\nthe girl Ave.\n\nI was returning from the northland at the time. A rumor had come down to\nVlama that one of the people in the snow country had seen a lone\nspecimen of the mulikka. Now these were but a myth. No man living\nremembers when the carvings on the House of Learning were made, and all\nthe wise men say that it hath been ages since any being other than man\nroamed the world. Yet, I was young. I determined to search for the thing\nanyhow; and 'twas only after wasting many days in the snow that I cursed\nmy luck, and turned back.\n\nI was afoot, for the going was too rough for my chariot. I had not yet\nquit the wilderness before, from a height, I spied a group of people\nascending from the valley. Knowing not whether they be friends or foes,\nI hid beside the path up which they must come; for I was weary and\nwanting no strife.\n\nYet I became alert enough when the three--they were two ditch-tenders,\none old, one young, and a girl--came within earshot. For they were\nquarreling. It seemed that the young man, who was plainly eager to gain\nthe girl, had fouled in a try to force her favor. The older man chided\nhim hotly.\n\nAnd just when they came opposite my rock, the younger man, whose passion\nhad got the better of him, suddenly tripped the older, so that he fell\nupon the ledge and would have fallen to his death on the rocks below had\nnot the girl, crying out in her terror, leaped forward and caught his\nhand.\n\nAt once the ditch-tender took the lass about the waist, and strove to\npull her away. For a moment she held fast, and in that moment I,\nStrokor, stood forth from behind the rock.\n\nNow, be it known that I am no champion of weaklings. I have no liking\nfor the troubles of others; enough of my own, say I. I was but angered\nthat the ditch-tender should have done the trick so clumsily, and upon\nan old man, at that. I cared not for the gray beard, nor what became of\nthe chit. I clapped the trickster upon the shoulder and spun him about.\n\n\"Ye clumsy coward!\" I jeered. \"Have ye had no practice that ye should\ntrip the old one no better than that?\"\n\n\"Who are ye?\" he stuttered, like the coward he was. I laughed and helped\nthe chit drag Maka--for it was he--up to safety.\n\n\"I am a far better man than ye,\" I said, not caring to give my name.\n\"And I can show ye how the thing should be done. Come; at me, if ye are\na man!\"\n\nAt that he dashed upon me; and such was his fear of ridicule--for the\ngirl was laughing him to scorn now--he put up a fair, stiff fight. But I\nforgot my weariness when he foully clotted me on the head with a stone.\nI drove at him with all the speed and suddenness my father had taught\nme, caught the fellow by the ankle, and brought him down atop me.\n\nThe rest was easy. I bent my knee under his middle, and tossed him high.\nIn a flash I was upon my feet, and caught him from behind. And in\nanother second I had rushed him to the cliff; and when he turned to save\nhimself, I tripped him as neatly as father himself could have done it,\nso that the fellow will guard the ditch no more, save in the caverns of\nHofe.\n\nI laughed and picked up my pack. My head hurt a bit from the fellow's\nblow, but a little water would do for that. I started to go.\n\n\"Ye are a brave man!\" cried the girl. I turned carelessly, and then,\nquite for the first time, I had a real look at her.\n\nShe was in no way like any woman I had seen. All of them had been much\nlike the men: brawny and close-knit, as well fitted for their work as\nare men for war. But this chit was all but slender; not skinny, but\nprettily rounded out, and soft like. I cannot say that I admired her at\nfirst glance; she seemed fit only to look at, not to live. I was minded\nof some of the ancient carvings, which show delicate, lightly built\nanimals that have long since been killed off; graceful trifles that\nrested the eye.\n\nAs for the old man: \"Aye, thou art brave, and wondrous strong, my lad,\"\nsaid he, still a bit shaky from his close call. I was pleased with the\nacknowledgment, and turned back.\n\n\"It was nothing,\" I told them; and I recounted some of my exploits,\nnotably one in which I routed a raiding party of men from Klow, six in\nall, carrying in two alive on my shoulders. \"I am the son of Strok, the\narmorer.\"\n\n\"Ye are Strokor!\" marveled the girl, staring at me as though I were a\ngod. Then she threw back her head and stepped close.\n\n\"I am Ave. This is Maka; he is my uncle, but best known as a star-gazer.\nMy father was Durok, the engine-maker.\" She watched my face.\n\n\"Durok?\" I knew him well. My father had said that he was quite as brainy\nas himself. \"He were a fine man, Ave.\"\n\n\"Aye,\" said she proudly. She stepped closer; I could not but see how\nlike him she was, though a woman. And next second she laid a hand on my\narm.\n\n\"I am yet a free woman, Strokor. Hast thou picked thy mate?\" And her\ncheeks flamed.\n\nNow, 'twas not my first experience of the kind. Many women had looked\nlike that at me before. But I had always been a man's man, and had ever\nheeded my father's warning to have naught whatever to do with women.\n\"They are the worst trick of all,\" he told me; and I had never forgot.\nBelike I owe much of my power to just this.\n\nBut Ave had acted too quickly for me to get away. I laughed again, and\nshook her off.\n\n\"I will have naught to do with ye,\" I told her, civilly enough. \"When I\nam ready to take a woman, I shall take her; not before.\"\n\nAt that the blood left her face; she stood very straight, and her eyes\nflashed dangerously. Were she a man I should have stood on my guard. But\nshe made no move; only the softness in her eyes gave way to such a\nsavage look that I was filled with amaze. And thus I left them; the old\nman calling down the blessing of Jon upon me for having saved his life,\nand the chit glaring after me as though no curses would suffice.\n\nA right queer matter, I thought at the time. I guessed not what would\ncome of it; not then.\n\n\n\nII\n\nTHE VISION\n\n\n'Twas a fortnight later, more or less, when next I saw Maka. I was\nlumbering along in my chariot, feeling most uncomfortable under the eyes\nof my friends; for one foot of my machine had a loose link, and 'twas\nflapping absurdly. And I liked it none too well when Maka stopped his\nown rattletrap in front of mine, and came running to my window. Next\nmoment I forgot his impertinence.\n\n\"Strokor,\" he whispered, his face alive with excitement, \"thou art a\nbrave lad, and didst save my life. Now, know you that a party of the men\nof Klow have secreted themselves under the stairway behind the emperor's\nthrone. They have killed the guards, and will of a certainty kill the\nemperor, too!\"\n\n\"'Twould serve the dolt right,\" I replied, for I really cared but\nlittle. \"But why have ye come to me, old man? I am but a lieutenant in\nthe armory; I am not the captain of the palace guard.\"\n\n\"Because,\" he answered, gazing at me very pleasingly, \"thou couldst\ndispose of the whole party single handed--there are but four--and gain\nmuch glory for thyself.\"\n\n\"By Jon!\" I swore, vastly delighted; and without stopping to ask Maka\nwhence he had got his knowledge, I went at once to the spot. However,\nwhen I got back, I sought the star-gazer--I ought to mention that I had\nno trouble with the louts, and that the emperor himself saw me finishing\noff the last of them--I sought the star-gazer and demanded how he had\nknown.\n\n\"Hast ever heard of Edam?\" he inquired in return.\n\n\"Edam?\" I had not; the name was strange to me. \"Who is he?\"\n\n\"A man as young as thyself, but a mere stripling,\" quoth Maka. \"He was a\npupil of mine when I taught in the House of Learning. Of late he has\nturned to prophecy; and it is fair remarkable how well the lad doth\nguess. At all events, 'twas he, Strokor, who told me of the plot. He saw\nit in a dream.\"\n\n\"Then Edam must yet be in Vlama,\" said I, \"if he were able to tell ye.\nCanst bring him to me? I would know him.\"\n\nAnd so it came about that, on the eve of that same day, Maka brought\nEdam to my house. I remember it well; for 'twas the same day that the\nemperor, in gratitude of my little service in the anteroom, had relieved\nme from my post in the armory and made me captain of the palace guard. I\nwas thus become the youngest captain, also the biggest and strongest;\nand, as will soon appear, by far the longest-headed.\n\nI was in high good humor, and had decided to celebrate with a feast. So\nwhen my two callers arrived, I sat them down before a meal such as cost\na tenth [Footnote: Since Mercury had no moon, its people never coined a\nword to correspond with our \"month,\" and for the same reason they never\nhad a week. Their time was reckoned only in days, years, and fractions\nof the two.] of my year's salary.\n\nI served not only the usual products of the field, variously prepared,\nbut as a special gift from the emperor's own stock, a piece of mulikka\nmeat, frozen, which had been found in the northland by some geologists a\nfew years aback. It had been kept in the palace icing-room all this\ntime, and was in prime condition. Maka and I enjoyed it overmuch, but\nEdam would touch it not.\n\nHe was a slightly built lad, not at all the sturdy man that I am, but of\nless than half the weight. His head, too, was unlike mine; his forehead\nwas wide as well as tall, and his eyes were mild as a slave's.\n\n\"Ye are very young to be a prophet,\" I said to him, after we were\nfilled, and the slaves had cleared away our litter. \"Tell me: hast\nforetold anything else that has come to pass?\"\n\n\"Aye,\" he replied, not at all boldly, but what some call modestly. \"I\nprophesied the armistice which now stands between our empire and\nKlow's.\"\n\n\"Is this true?\" I demanded of Maka. The old man bowed his head gravely\nand looked upon the young man with far more respect than I felt. He\nadded:\n\n\"Tell Strokor the dream thou hadst two nights ago, Edam. It were a right\nstrange thing, whether true or no.\"\n\nThe stripling shifted his weight on his stool, and moved the bowl\ncloser. Then he thrust his pipe deep into it, and let the liquid flow\nslowly out his nostrils. [Footnote: A curious custom among the\nMercurians, who had no tobacco. There is no other way to explain some of\nthe carvings. Doubtless the liquid was sweet-smelling, and perhaps\nslightly narcotic.]\n\n\"I saw this,\" he began, \"immediately before rising, and after a very\nlight supper; so I know that it was a vision from Jon, and not of my own\nmaking.\n\n\"I was standing upon the summit of a mountain, and gazing down upon a\nvery large, fertile valley. It was heavily wooded, dark green and\ninviting. But what first drew my attention was a great number of animals\nmoving about IN THE AIR. They were passing strange affairs, some large,\nsome small, variously colored, and all covered with the same sort of\nfur, quite unlike any hair I have ever seen.\"\n\n\"In the air?\" I echoed, recovering from my astonishment. Then I laughed\nmightily. \"Man, ye must be crazy! There is no animal can live in the\nair! Ye must mean in the water or on land.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" interposed the star-gazer. \"Thou hast never studied the stars,\nStrokor, or thou wouldst know that there be a number of them which,\nthrough the enlarging tube, show themselves to be round worlds, like\nunto our own.\n\n\"And it doth further appear that these other worlds also have air like\nthis we breathe, and that some have less, while others have even more.\nFrom what Edam has told me,\" finished the old man, \"I judge that his\nvision took place on Jeos, [Footnote: The Mercurian word for earth.] a\nworld much larger than ours according to my calculations, and doubtless\nhaving enough air to permit very light creatures to move about in it.\"\n\n\"Go on,\" said I to Edam, good-humoredly. \"I be ever willing to believe\nanything strange when my stomach is full.\"\n\nThe dreamer had taken no offense. \"Then I bent my gaze closer, as I am\nalways able, in visions. And I saw that the greenery was most remarkably\ndense, tangled and luxuriant to a degree not ever seen here. And moving\nabout in it was the most extraordinary collection of beings that I have\never laid these eyes upon.\n\n\"There were some huge creatures, quite as tall as thy house, Strokor,\nwith legs as big around as that huge chest of thine. They had tails, as\nhad our ancient mulikka, save that these were terrific things, as long\nand as big as the trunk of a large tree. I know not their names.\n[Footnote: Probably the dinosaur.]\n\n\"And then, at the other extreme, was a tiny creature of the air, which\nmoved with a musical hum. It could have hid under thy finger-nail,\nStrokor, yet it had a tiny sharp-pointed bill, with which it stung most\naggravatingly. And between these two there were any number of creatures\nof varying size and shape.\n\n\"But nowhere was there a sign of a man. True, there was one hairy,\ngrotesque creature which hung by its hands and feet from the tree-tops,\nvery like thee in some way, Strokor; but its face and head were those of\na brainless beast, not of a man. Nowhere was a creature like me or thee.\n\n\"And the most curious thing was this: Although there were ten times as\nmany of these creatures, big and little, to the same space as on our\nworld, yet there was no great amount of strife. In truth, there is far\nmore combat and destruction among we men than among the beasts.\n\n\"And,\" he spoke most earnestly, as though he would not care to be\ndisbelieved, \"I saw fathers fight to protect their young!\"\n\nI near fell from my stool in my amaze. Never in all my life had I heard\na thing so far from the fact. \"What!\" I shouted. \"Ye sit there like a\nsane man, and tell me ye saw fathers fight for their young?\"\n\nHe nodded his head, still very gravely. I fell silent for want of words,\nbut Maka put in a thought. \"It would appear, Strokor, that it be not so\nmuch of an effort for beings to live, there on Jeos, as here. Perchance\n'tis the greater amount of vegetation; at all accounts, the animals need\nnot prey upon one another so generally; and that, then, would explain\nwhy some have energy enough to waste in the care of their young.\"\n\n\"I can understand,\" I said, very slowly. \"I can understand why a mother\nwill fight for her babes; 'tis reasonable enough, no doubt. But as for\nfathers doing the same--Edam, dost mean to say that ALL creatures on\nJeos do this?\"\n\n\"Nay; only some. It may be that fewer than half of the varieties have\nthe custom. Howbeit, 'tis a beautiful one. When the vision ended I was\nright loath to go.\"\n\n\"Faugh!\" I spat upon the ground. \"Such softness makes me ill! I be glad\nI were born in a man's world, where I can take a man's chances. I want\nno favoring. If I am strong enough to live, I live; if not, I die. What\nmore can I ask?\"\n\n\"Aye, my lad!\" said Maka approvingly. \"This be a world for the strong.\nThere is no room here for others; there is scarce enough food for those\nwho, thanks to their strength, do survive.\" He slipped the gold band\nfrom off his wrist, and held it up for Jon to see. \"Here, Strokor, a\npledge! A pledge to--the survival of the fittest!\"\n\n\"A neat, neat wording!\" I roared, as I took the pledge with him. Then we\nboth stopped short. Edam had not joined us. \"Edam, my lad,\" spake the\nold man, \"ye will take the pledge with us?\"\n\nThe stripling's eyes were troubled. Well he knew that, once he refused\nsuch an act, he were no longer welcome in my house, nor in Maka's. But\nwhen he looked around it were bravely enough.\n\n\"Men, I have neither the strength of the one nor the brains of the other\nof ye. I am but a watchmaker; I live because of my skill with the little\nwheels.\n\n\"I have no quarrel with either of ye.\" He got to his feet, and started\nto the door. \"But I cannot take the pledge with ye.\n\n\"I have seen a wondrous thing, and I love it. And, though I know not\nwhy--I feel that Jon has willed it for Jeos to see a new race of men, a\nrace even better than ours.\"\n\nI leaped to my feet. \"Better than ours! Mean ye to say, stripling, that\nthere can be a better man than Strokor?\"\n\nI full expected him to shrink from me in fear; I was able to crush him\nwith one blow. But he stood his ground; nay, stepped forward and laid a\nhand easily upon my shoulder.\n\n\"Strokor--ye are more than a man; ye are two men in one. There is no\nfiner--I say it fair. And yet, I doubt not that there can be, and will\nbe, a better!\"\n\nAnd with that such a curious expression came into his face, such a glow\nof some strange land of warmth, that I let my hand drop and suffered him\nto depart in peace--such was my wonder.\n\nBesides, any miserable lout could have destroyed the lad.\n\nMaka sat deep in thought for a time, and when he did speak he made no\nmention of the lad who had just quit us. Instead, he looked me over,\nlong and earnestly, and at the end he shook his head sorrowfully and\nsighed:\n\n\"Thou art the sort of a son I would have had, Strokor, given the wits of\nthy father to hold a woman like thy mother. And thou didst save my\nlife.\"\n\nHe mused a little longer, then roused himself and spake sharply: \"Thou\nart a vain man, Strokor!\"\n\n\"Aye,\" I agreed, willingly enough. \"And none has better cause than I!\"\n\nHe would not acknowledge the quip. \"Thou hast everything needful to\ntickle thy vanity. Thou hast the envy of those who note thy strength,\nthe praise of them who love thy courage, and the respect of they who\nvalue thy brains. All these thou hast--and yet ye have not that which is\nbest!\"\n\nI thought swiftly and turned on him with a frown: \"Mean ye that I am not\nhandsome enough?\"\n\n\"Nay, Strokor,\" quoth the star-gazer. \"There be none handsomer in this\nworld, no matter what the standard of any other, such as Edam's Jeos.\n\n\"It is not that. It is, that thou hast no ambition.\"\n\nI considered this deeply. At first thought it was not true; had I not\nalways made it a point to best my opponent? From my youth it had been\never my custom to succeed where bigger bodies and older minds had\nfailed. Was not this ambition?\n\nBut before I disputed the point with Maka, I saw what he meant. I had no\nFINAL ambition, no ultimate goal for which to strive. I had been content\nfrom year to year to outdo each rival as he came before me; and now,\nwith mind and body alike in the pink of condition, I was come to the\nplace where none durst stand before me.\n\n\"Ye are right, Maka,\" I admitted, not because I cared to gratify his\nconceit, but because it were always for my own good to own up when\nwrong, that I might learn the better. \"Ye are right; I need to decide\nupon a life-purpose. What have ye thought?\"\n\nThe old man was greatly pleased. \"Our talk with Edam brought it all\nbefore me. Know you, Strokor, that the survival of the fittest is a rule\nwhich governs man as well as men. It applies to the entire population,\nStrokor, just as truly as to me or thee.\n\n\"In fine, we men who are now the sole inhabitants of this world, are\ndescended from a race of people who survived solely because they were\nfitter than the mulikka, fitter than the reptiles, the fittest, by far,\nof all the creatures.\n\n\"That being the case, it is plain that in time either our empire, or\nthat of Klow's, must triumph over the other. And that which remains\nshall be the fittest!\"\n\n\"Hold!\" I cried. \"Why cannot matters remain just as they now are--and\nforever?\"\n\n\"That\" he said rapidly, \"is because thou knowest so little about the\nfuture of this world. But I am famed as a student of the heavens; and I\ntell thee it is possible, by means of certain delicate measuring\ninstruments, together with the highest mathematics, to keep a very close\nwatch upon the course of our world. And we now know that our year is\nmuch shorter than it was in the days of the mulikka.\"\n\nI nodded my head. \"Rightly enough, since our days are become steadily\nlonger, for some mysterious reason.\"\n\n\"A reason no longer a mystery,\" quoth Maka. \"It is now known that the\nsun is a very powerful magnet, and that it is constantly pulling upon\nour world and bringing it nearer and nearer to himself. That is why it\nhath become slightly warmer during the past hundred years; the records\nshow it plain. And the same influence has caused the lengthening of our\nday.\"\n\nHe stopped and let me think. Soon I saw it clearly enough; a time must\ncome when the increasing warmth of the sun would stifle all forms of\nvegetable life, and that would mean the choking of mankind. It might\ntake untold centuries; yet, plainly enough, the world must some day\nbecome too small for even those who now remained upon it.\n\nSuddenly I leaped to my feet and strode the room in my excitement. \"Ye\nare right, Maka!\" I shouted, thoroughly aroused. \"There cannot always be\nthe two empires. In time one or the other must prevail; Jon has willed\nit. And--\" I stopped short and stared at him--\"I need not tell ye which\nit shall be!\"\n\n\"I knew thou wouldst see the light, Strokor! Thou hast thy father's\nbrains.\"\n\nI sat me down, but instantly leaped up again, such was my enthusiasm.\n\"Maka,\" I cried, \"our emperor is not the man for the place! It is true\nthat he were a brave warrior in his youth; he won the throne fairly. And\nwe have suffered him to keep it because he is a wise man, and because we\nhave had little trouble with the men of Klow since their defeat two\ngenerations agone.\n\n\"But he, today, is content to sit at his ease and quote platitudes about\nlive and let live. Faugh! I am ashamed that I should even have given ear\nto him!\"\n\nI stopped short and glared at the old man. \"Maka--hark ye well! If it be\nthe will of Jon to decide between the men of Klow and the men of\nVlamaland, then it is my intent to take a hand in this decision!\"\n\n\"Aye, my lad,\" he said tranquilly; and then added, quite as though he\nknew what my answer must be: \"How do ye intend to go about it?\"\n\n\"Like a man! I, Strokor, shall become the emperor!\"\n\n\n\nIII\n\nTHE THRONE\n\n\nA small storm had come up while Maka and I were talking. Now, as he was\nabout to quit me, the clouds were clearing away and an occasional stroke\nof lightning came down. One of these, however, hit the ground such a\nshort distance away that both of us could smell the smoke.\n\nMy mind was more alive than it had ever been before. \"Now, what caused\nthat, Maka? The lightning, I mean; we have it nearly every day, yet I\nhave never thought to question it before.\"\n\n\"It is no mystery, my lad,\" quoth Maka, dodging into his chariot, so\nthat he was not wet. \"I myself have watched the thing from the top of\nhigh mountains, where the air is so light that a man can scarce get\nenough to fill his lungs; and I say unto you that, were it not for what\nair we have, we should have naught save the lightning. The space about\nthe air is full of it.\"\n\nHe started his engine, then leaned out into the rain and said softly:\n\"Hold fast to what thy father has taught thee, Strokor. Have nothing to\ndo with the women. 'Tis a man's job ahead of thee, and the future of the\nempire is in thy hands.\n\n\"And,\" as he clattered off, \"fill not thy head with wonderings about the\nlightning.\"\n\n\"Aye,\" said I right earnestly, and immediately turned my thoughts to my\nnew ambition. And yet the thing Maka had just told me kept coming back\nto my mind, and so it does to this very day. I know not why I should\nmention it at all save that each time I think upon Maka, I also think\nupon the lightning, whether I will or no.\n\nI slept not at all that night, but sat [Footnote: It seems to have been\nthe custom among the soldiers never to lie down, but to take their sleep\nsitting or standing; a habit not hard to form where the gravitation was\nso slight. No doubt this also explains their stunted legs.] till the\ndawn came, thinking out a plan of action. By that time I was fair\nconvinced that there was naught to be gained by waiting; waiting makes\nme impatient as well. I determined to act at once; and since one day is\nquite as good as the next, I decided that this day was to see the thing\nbegun.\n\nI came before the emperor at noon and received my decorations. Within\nthe hour I had made myself known to the four and ninety men who were to\nbe my command; a picked company, all of a height and weight, with bodies\nthat lacked little of my own perfection. Never was there a finer guard\nabout the palace.\n\nMy first care was to pick a quarrel with the outgoing commander. Twere\neasy enough; he was green with envy, anyhow. And so it came about that\nwe met about mid afternoon, with seconds, in a well-frequented field in\nthe outskirts.\n\nBefore supper was eaten my entire troop knew that their new captain had\ntossed his ball-slinger away without using it, had taken twenty balls\nfrom their former commander's weapon, and while thus wounded had charged\nthe man and despatched him with bare hands! Needless to say, this\nexploit quite won their hearts; none but a blind man could have missed\nthe respect they showed me when, all bandaged and sore, I lined them up\nnext morning. Afterward I learned that they had all taken a pledge to\n\"follow Strokor through the gates of Hofe itself!\"\n\n'Twere but a week later that, fully recovered and in perfect fettle, I\ncalled my men together one morn as the sun rose. By that time I had\ngiven them a sample of my brains through ordering a rearrangement of\ntheir quarters such as made the same much more comfortable. Also, I had\ndealt with one slight infraction of the rules in such a drastic fashion\nthat they knew I would brook no trifling. All told, 'tis hard to say\nwhether they thought the most of me or of Jon.\n\n\"Men,\" said I, as bluntly as I knew, \"the emperor is an old man. And, as\nye know, he is disposed to be lenient toward the men of Klow; whereas,\nye and I well know that the louts are blackguards.\n\n\"Now, I will tell ye more. It has come to me lately that Klow is\nplotting to attack us with strange weapons.\" I thought best, considering\ntheir ignorance, not to give them my own reasons. \"Of course I have told\nthe emperor of it; yet he will not act. He says to wait till we are\nattacked.\"\n\nI stopped and watched their faces. Sure enough; the idea fair made them\nache. Each and every one of these men was spoiling for a fight.\n\n\"Now, tell me; how would ye like to become the emperor's body-guard?\" I\ndid not have to wait long; the light that flared in their faces told me\nplainly. \"And--how would ye like to have me for your emperor?\"\n\nAt that their tongues were loosed, and I hindered them not. They yelled\nfor pure joy, and pressed about me like a pack of children. I saw that\nthe time was ripe for action.\n\n\"Up, then!\" I roared, and, of course, led the way. We met the emperor's\nguard on the lower stairs; and from that point on we fair hacked our way\nthrough.\n\nWell, no need to describe the fight. For a time I thought we were gone;\nthe guards had a cunningly devised labyrinth on the second floor, and\nattacked us from holes in a false ceiling, so that we suffered heavily\nat first. But I saw what was amiss, and shouted to my men to clear away\nthe timbers; and after that it was clear work. I lost forty men before\nthe guard was disposed of. The emperor I finished myself; he dodged\nright spryly for a time, but at last I caught him and tossed him to the\nfoot of the upper stairs. And there he still lies for none of my men\nwould touch him, nor would I. We covered him with quicklime and some\nearth.\n\nAs soon as we had taken care of those who were not too far gone, I\ncalled the men together and caused a round of spirits to be served. Then\nwe all feasted on the emperor's store, and soon were feeling like\nourselves.\n\n\"Men,\" I said impressively, \"I am proud of ye. Never did an emperor have\nsuch a dangerous gang of bullies!\"\n\nAt that they all grinned happily, and I added: \"And 'tis a fine staff of\ngenerals that ye'll make!\"\n\nNeed I say more? Those men would have overturned the palace for me had I\nsaid the word. As it was, they obeyed my next orders in such a spirit\nthat success was assured from the first.\n\nFirst, using the dead emperor's name, I caused the various chiefs to be\nbrought together at once to the court chamber. At the same time I\ncontrived, by means I need not go into here, to prevent any word of our\naction from getting abroad. So, when the former staff faced me the next\nmorning, they learned that they were to be executed. I could trust not\none; they were all friends of the old man.\n\nWith the chiefs out of the way, and my own men taking their commands,\nthe whole army fell into my hands. True, there were some insurrections\nhere and there; but my men handled them with such speed and harshness\nthat any further stubbornness turned to admiration. By this time the\nfame of Strokor was spread throughout the empire.\n\nAnd thus it came about that, within a week of the night that old Maka\nfirst put the idea into my head, Strokor, son of Strok, reigned\nthroughout Vlamaland. And, to make it complete, the army celebrated my\naccession by taking a pledge before Jon:\n\n\"To Strokor, the fittest of the fit!\"\n\n\n\nIV\n\nTHE ASSAULT\n\n\nNow, out of a total population of perhaps three million, I had about a\nquarter-million first-class fighters in my half of the world. Klow, by\ncomparison, had but two-thirds the number; his land was not a rich one.\n\nBut he had the advantage of knowing, some while in advance, of the new\nruler in Vlama; and shortly my spies reported that his armories were\ndevising a new type of weapon. 'Twas a strange verification of my own\nfiction to my men. I could learn nothing, however, about it.\n\nMeanwhile I caused a vast number of flat-boats to be built, all in\nsecret. Each of them was intended for a single fighter and his supplies;\nand each was so arranged, with side paddle wheels, that it would be\ndriven by the motor in the soldier's chariot, and thus give each his own\nboat.\n\nAgain discarding all precedent, I packed not all my forces together, as\nhad been done in the past, but scattered them up and adown the coast\nfronting the land of Klow; and at a prearranged time my quarter-million\nmen set out, a company in each tiny fleet. Some were slightly in advance\nof the rest, who had the shorter distance to travel. And, just as I had\nplanned, we all arrived at a certain spot on Klow's coast at practically\nthe same hour, although two nights later.\n\n'Twas a brilliant stroke. The enemy looked not for a fleet of water-\nants, ready to step right out of the sea into battle. Their fleet was\nlooking for us, true, but not in that shape. And we were all safely\nashore before they had ceased to scour the seas for us.\n\nI immediately placed my heavy machines, and just as all former\nexpeditions had done, opened the assault at once with a shower of the\npoison shells. I relied, it will be seen, upon the surprise of my attack\nto strike terror into the hearts of the louts.\n\nBut apparently they were prepared for anything, no matter how rapid the\nattack. My bombardment had not proceeded many moments before, to my\ndismay, some of their own shells began to fall among us. Soon they were\ngiving as good as we.\n\n\"Now, how knew they that we should come to this spot?\" I demanded of\nMaka. I had placed him in my cabinet as soon as I had reached the\nthrone.\n\nThe old man stroked his beard gravely. \"Perchance it had been wrong to\ncome to the old landing. They simply began shelling it as a matter of\ncourse.\"\n\n\"Ye are right again,\" I told him; and forthwith moved my pieces over\ninto another triangle. (Previously, of course, all my charioteers had\ngone on toward the capital). However, I took care to move my machines,\none at a time, so that there was no let-up in my bombardment.\n\nBut scarce had we taken up the new position before the enemy's shells\nlikewise shifted, and began to strike once more in our midst. I swore a\ngreat oath and whirled upon Maka in wrath.\n\n\"Think ye that there be a spy among us?\" I demanded. \"How else can ye\nexplain this thing? My men have combed the land about us; there are none\nof the louts secreted here; and, even so, they could not have notified\nKlow so soon. Besides, 'tis pitch dark.\" I were sorely mystified.\n\nAll we could do was to fling our shells as fast as our machines would\nwork and dodge the enemy's hail as best we could. Thus the time passed,\nand it were near dawn when the first messengers [Footnote: Messengers;\nno telegraph or telephone, much less wireless. In a civilization as\nstrenuous as that of Mercury, there was never enough consideration for\nothers to lead to such socially beneficial things as these, no more than\nrailroads or printing presses. Civilization appears to be in exact\nproportion to the ease of getting a living, other conditions being\nequal.] returned.\n\n\"They have stopped us just outside the walls of the city,\" was the\nreport. It pleased me that they should have pushed so far at first; I\nclimbed at once into my chariot.\n\n\"Now is the time for Strokor to strike!\" I gave orders for the staff to\nremain where it was. \"I will send ye word when the city is mine.\"\n\nBut before I started my engine I glanced up at the sky, to see if the\ndawn were yet come; and as I gazed I thought I saw something come\nbetween me and a star. I brushed the hair away from my eyes, and looked\nagain. To my boundless surprise I made out, not one, but three strange\nobjects moving about swiftly in the air!\n\n\"Look!\" I cried, and my whole staff craned their necks. In a moment all\nhad seen, and great was their wonder. I blamed them not for their fears.\n\n'Twas Maka who spoke first. \"They are much too large to be creatures of\nJon,\" he muttered. \"They must be some trick of the enemy.\n\n\"Dost recall Edam's vision of the creatures in the air of Jeos?\" he went\non, knowing that I would not hinder him. \"Now, as I remember it, he said\nthey flew with great speed. Were it not possible, Strokor, for suitable\nengines to propel very light structures at such high speed as to remain\nsuspended in the air, after the manner of leaves in a storm? I note\nthese strangers move quite fast.\"\n\nIt was even so; and at that same instant one of them swung directly\nabove our heads, so close that I could hear the hum of a powerful\nengine. So it was only a trick! I shook myself together.\n\n\"Attention!\" My staff drew up at the word. \"They are but few; fear them\nnot! We waste no more time here! Pack up the machines, and follow!\"\n\nAnd thus we charged upon Klow.\n\nI found that my men had entirely surrounded the city. Klow's men were\nputting up a plucky fight, and showing no signs of fearing us. Seeing\nthis, I blew a blast on my engine's whistle, so that my bullies might\nknow that I had come.\n\nImmediately the word ran up and down the line, so that within a few\nminutes Klow was facing a roaring crowd of half-mad terrors. I myself\nset the example by charging the nearest group of the enemy, all of whom\nwere mounted within the rather small and perfectly circular chariots\nwhich they preferred. They were quick, but slippery. Also, they could\nnot stand before a determined rush, as several of them learned after\nvainly trying to slip some balls through my windows and, failing in\nthat, striving to get away from me.\n\nBut I ran them down, and toppled them over, and dropped suffocation\nbombs into their little cages with such vigor and disregard of their\nvolleys that my men could not resist the example. We charged all along\nthat vast circular line, and we cheered mightily when the whole front\nbroke, turned tail, and ran before us.\n\nBut scarce had they got away before a queer thing happened. A flock of\nthose great air-creatures, some eight altogether, rose up from the\nmiddle of the city. It was now fairly light, and we could see well. One\nof them had some sort of engine trouble, so that it had to return at\nonce; but the other seven came out to the battle-line and began to\ncircle the city.\n\nAs they did so they dropped odd, misshapen parcels, totally unlike\nmaterials of war; but when they struck they gave off prodigious puffs of\na greenish smoke, of so terribly pungent a nature that my men dropped\nbefore it like apples from a shaken tree. 'Twas a fearful sight; lucky\nfor us that the louts had had no practice, else few of us should be\nalive to tell the tale.\n\nAnd so they swept around the great circle, many triangles in area; and\neverywhere the unthinkable things smote the hearts of my men with a fear\nthey had never known. Only one of the devices suffered; it was brought\ndown by a chance fling of a poison shell. The rest, after loosing their\nburdens, returned to the city for more.\n\nI am no fool. I saw that we could do nothing against such weapons, but\nmust use all our wits if we escaped even.\n\n\"Return!\" I commanded, and instantly my staff whistled the code. The men\nobeyed with alacrity, making off at top speed with the men of Klow in\nhot pursuit, although able to do little damage.\n\nAye, it were a sorrowful thing, that retreat. The best I could do was to\nremain till the very last, having to deal with a number of persistent\nlouts who all but suffocated me, at that. But I managed to empty my\nslinger into some of them and to topple the rest. I was mainly angry\nthat Klow had not showed himself.\n\nBy the time I had reached the seashore, most of my men were in their\nboats. Again I stayed till the last, although I could see the enemy's\nfleet bearing down hard upon us from the north. In truth we would have\nall been lost, had we come in the manner of former campaigns, all\ntogether in big transports. But because we could scatter every which\nway, the fleet harmed us little; and four-fifths of us got safely back.\n\nHappily, none of the air-machines had range enough to reach Vlamaland.\nAs soon as I could get my staff together, I gave orders such as would\ninsure discipline. Then, reminding my hearties that Klow, knowing our\nhelplessness, would surely attack as soon as fully equipped, I made this\noffer:\n\n\"To the man who shall suggest the best way of meeting their attack, I\nshall give the third of my empire!\"\n\nSo they knew that the case was desperate. As for myself, I slept not a\nbit, but paced my sleep-chamber and thought deeply.\n\nNow, a bit of a shell, from an enemy slinger, had penetrated my arm.\nTill now, I had paid no attention to it. But it began to bother me, so I\npulled the metal from my arm with my teeth. And quite by chance I placed\nthe billet on the table within a few inches of the compass I had carried\non my boat.\n\nTo my intense surprise the needle of the compass swung violently about,\nso that one end pointed directly at the fragment of metal. I moved them\ncloser together; there was no doubt that they were strongly attracted.\nThe enemy's shells were made of mere iron!\n\nThe moment I fully realized this, I saw clearly how we might baffle the\nmen of Klow. I instantly summoned some men gave the orders much as\nthough I had known for years what was to be done, and in a few moments\nhad the satisfaction of seeing my messengers hurrying north and south.\n\nAnd so it came about that, within three days of our shameful retreat, a\ntenth of my men were at work on the new project. As yet there was no\nword from my spies across the sea; but we worked with all possible\nhaste. And this, very briefly, is what we did:\n\nWe laid a gigantic line of iron clear across the empire. From north to\nsouth, from snow to snow; one end was bedded in the island of Pathna,\nwhere the north magnetic-pole is found, while the other stopped on the\nopposite side of the world, in a hole dug through the ice into the solid\nearth of the South Polar Plain. And every foot of that enormous rod--\n'twas as big around as my leg--was insulated from the ground with pieces\nof our secret non-magnetic alloy!\n\nNot for nothing had our chemists sought the metal which would resist the\nlightning. And not for nothing did my bullies piece the rod together,\nall working at the same time, so that the whole thing were complete in\nseven days. That is, complete save for the final connecting link; and\nthat lay, a loglike roll of iron, at the door of my palace, ready to be\nrolled into place when I were but ready.\n\nAnd on the morrow the Klow reached our shores.\n\n\n\nV\n\nTHE VICTORY\n\n\nMy first intent was to let them advance unhampered; but Maka pointed out\nthat such a policy might give them suspicions, and so we disputed their\ncourse all the way. I gave orders to show no great amount of resistance;\nand thus, the louts reached Vlama in high feather, confident that the\ngame was theirs.\n\nI stood at the door of the palace as Klow himself rolled up to the edge\nof the parade-ground. My men, obeying orders, had given way to him; his\ncrews swarmed the space behind and on all sides of him, while my own\nbullies were all about and behind the palace. Never did two such giant\narmies face one another in peace; for I had caused my banner to be\nfloated wrong end to, in token of surrender.\n\nFirst, a small body of subordinates waited upon me, demanding that I\ngive up the throne. I answered that I would treat with none save Klow\nhimself; and shortly the knave, surrounded by perhaps fifty underlings,\nstepped up before me.\n\n\"Hail, Stroker!\" he growled, his voice shaking a bit with excitement;\nnot with fear, for he were a brave man. \"Hail to thee and to thine, and\na pleasant stay in Hofe for ye all!\"\n\n\"Hail, Klow!\" replied I, glancing up meaningly at the air monsters\nwheeling there. \"I take it that ye purpose to execute us.\"\n\n\"Aye,\" he growled savagely. \"Thou didst attack without provocation. Thy\nlife is forfeit, and as many more as may be found needful to guarantee\npeace.\"\n\n\"Then,\" I quoth, my manner changing, \"then ye have saved me the trouble\nof deciding what shall be thy fate. Execution, say you? So be it!\"\n\nAnd I strode down to the great log of iron which lay ready to fill the\ngap. Klow looked at me with a peculiar expression, as though he thought\nme mad. True, it looked it; how could I do him harm without myself\nsuffering?\n\nBut I kicked the props which held the iron, and gave it a start with my\nfoot. The ends of the pole-to-pole rod lay concealed by brush, perchance\nfifty yards away. In ten seconds that last section had rolled completely\nbetween them; and only a fool would have missed seeing that, the last\nten feet, the iron was fair jerked through the air.\n\nAs this happened we all heard a tremendous crackling, like that of\nnearby lightning, while enormous clouds of dust arose from the two\nconcealed ends, which were now become connections. And at the same time\na loud, steely click, just one and no more, sounded from the intruding\nhost.\n\nFor a moment Klow was vastly puzzled. Then he snarled angrily: \"What\nmeans this foolery, Strokor? Advance, and give up thy ax!\"\n\nFor answer I turned me about, so as to face my men, and held up my hand\nin signal. Instantly the whistles sounded, and my hearties came bounding\ninto the field.\n\n\"Treachery!\" shouted Klow; and his officers ran here and there,\nshouting: \"To arms! Charge and destroy! No quarter!\"\n\nBut I paid little attention to the hubbub. I were gazing up at those\ninfernal creatures of the air; and my heart sang within me as I saw\nthem, circling erratically but very surely down to the earth. And as\nthey came nearer, my satisfaction was entire; for their engines were\nsilent!\n\nAt the same time consternation was reigning among our visitors. Not a\nman of all Klow's thousands was able to move his car or lift a weapon.\nEvery slinger was jammed, as though frozen by invisible ice; all their\nballs and shells were stuck together, like the work of a transparent\nglue. Even their side arms were locked in their scabbards; and all their\ntugging could budge them not!\n\nBut none of my men were so handicapped. Each man's chariot was running\nas though naught had happened; they thundered forward, discharging their\nballs and shells as freely as they had across the sea. Their charge was\na murderous one; not a man of Klow's was able to resist, save with what\nforce he could put into his bare hands.\n\nKlow saw all this from the middle of his group of officers. None were\nable to more than place his body 'twixt us and their chief. In a very\nfew moments they saw that the unknown magic had made them as children in\nour hands; they were utterly lost; and Klow turned away from the sight\nwith a black face. Again he faced me.\n\n\"What means this, ye huge bundle of lies? What mean ye by tricking us\nwith yon badge of surrender, only to tie our hands with thy magic of\nHofe? Is this the way to fight like a man?\"\n\nI had stood at ease in my door since rolling the iron. Now, I looked\nabout me still more easily; my men were running down the louts, who had\njumped from their useless chariots and taken to their heels. 'Twere but\na matter of time before the army of Klow would be no more, at that rate.\n\n\"Klow,\" I answered him mildly; \"ye are right; this is not the way to\nfight like a man. Neither,\" I pointed out one of the fallen air-cars;\n\"neither is that the way, flitting over our heads like shadows, and\ndestroying us with filthy smoke! Shame on ye, Klow, for stooping to\nsuch! And upon thy own head be the blame for the trick I have played\nupon ye!\"\n\n\"You attacked us without provocation,\" he muttered, sourly.\n\n\"Aye, and for a very good reason,\" I replied. \"Yet I see thy viewpoint,\nand shalt give thee the benefit of the doubt.\" I turned to my whistlers\nand gave an order; so that presently the great slaughter had stopped. My\nmen and Klow's alike struggled back to see what were amiss.\n\nI handed Klow an ax. \"Throw away thine own, scabbard and all,\" I told\nhim. \"It is useless, for 'tis made of iron. Ours, and all our tools of\nwar, are formed of an alloy which is immune from the magic.\"\n\nHe took the ax in wonderment. \"What means it, Strokor?\" asked he again,\nmeanwhile stripping himself in a businesslike fashion that it were good\nto see.\n\n\"It means,\" said I, throwing off my robe, \"that I have unchained the\nmagnetism of this world. Know you, Klow, that all of the children of the\nsun are full of his power; it is like unto that of the tiny magnet which\nye give children for to play; but it is mighty, even as our world is\nmighty.\"\n\n\"Good Jon!\" he gasped; for his was not a daring mind. \"What have ye\ndone, ye trifler?\"\n\n\"I have transformed this empire into one vast magnet,\" I answered\ncoolly. Then I showed him a boulder on the summit of a distant hill;\nthrough the tube, Klow could see some of my men standing beside it.\n\n\"Place one of thy own men on the roof of the palace,\" I told Klow, \"and\ngive him orders to lower my banner should ye give him the word.\n\n\"For upon the outcome of this fight 'twixt me and thee, Klow, hinges the\nwhole affair! If thou dost survive, down comes my banner; and my men on\nthe hill shall topple the boulder which shall rush down the slope and\nburst the iron rod and break the spell. Stand, then, and defend\nthyself!\"\n\nAnd it did me good to see the spirit fly into his eyes. He saw that his\nempire lived or died as he lived or died, and he fought as he had never\nfought before. Small man that he was beside myself, he were wondrous\nquick and sure in his motions; before I knew it, he had bit his ax deep\ninto my side.\n\nAnd in another moment or two it was over. For, as soon as I felt the\npain of that gash, I flung my own blade away; and with a roar such as\nwould have shaken a stouter heart than his, I charged the man, took a\nsecond fearful blow full on my chest and heeding it not at all I\nsnatched the ax from his hands. Then, as he turned to run, I dropped\nthat tool also.\n\nAnd I ran him down, and felled him, and broke his head with my hands.\n\n\n\nVI\n\nTHE FITTEST\n\n[Footnote: This chapter was originally as long as the others, but an\nunfortunate accident of Mr. Smith's, before he was thoroughly familiar\nwith the machine, mutilated a large portion of the tape so badly that it\nwas made worthless. This explains why something appears to be missing\nfrom the account, and also why this chapter begins in the middle of a\nsentence.]\n\nslaves; but the most were slain. Neither could we bother with their\nwomen and others left behind.\n\nNow, by this time the empire was as one man in its worship of me. I had\nbeen emperor but a year, and already I had made it certain that only the\nmen of Vlamaland, and no others, should live in the sight of Jon. So\nwell thought they of me, I might fair have sat upon my reputation, and\nhave spent my last days in feasting like the man before me.\n\nBut I was still too young and full of energy to take my ease. I found\nmyself more and more restless; I had naught to do; it had all been done.\nAt last I sent for old Maka.\n\n\"Ye put me up to this, ye old fraud,\" I told him, pretending to be\nwrathful. \"Now set me another task, or I'll have thy head!\"\n\nHe knew me too well to be affrighted. He said that he had been\nconsidering my case of late.\n\n\"Strokor, thy father was right when he told thee to have naught to do\nwith women. That is to say, he were right at the time. Were he alive\ntoday\"--I forgot to say that my father was killed in the battle across\nthe sea--\"he would of a certainty say that it were high time for thee to\npick thy mate.\n\n\"Remember, Strokor; great though thou art, yet when death taketh thee\nthy greatness is become a memory. Methinks ye should leave something\nmore substantial behind.\"\n\nIt took but little thought to convince me that Maka were right once\nmore. Fact; as soon as I thought upon it, it were a woman that I was\nrestless for. The mere notion instantly gave me something worth while to\nlook forward to.\n\n\"Jon bless thee!\" I told the old man. \"Ye have named both the trouble\nand the remedy. I will attend to it at once.\"\n\nHe sat thinking for some time longer. \"Has thought of any woman in\nspecial, Strokor?\" said he.\n\nI had not. The idea was too new to me. \"The best in the world shall be\nmine, of course,\" I told him. \"But as for which one--hast any notion\nthyself?\"\n\n\"Aye,\" he quoth. \"'Tis my own niece I have in mind. Perchance ye\nremember her; a pretty child, who was with me when thou didst save my\nlife up there on the mountainside.\"\n\nI recalled the chit fairly well. \"But she were not a vigorous woman,\nMaka. Think you she is fit for me?\"\n\n\"Aye, if any be,\" he replied earnestly. \"Ave is not robust, true, but\nher muscles are as wires. It is because of what lies in her head,\nhowever, that I commend her. I have taught her all I know.\"\n\n\"So!\" I exclaimed, much pleased. \"Then she is indeed fit to be the\nempress. And as I recall her, she were exceedingly good to look at.\"\n\n\"Say no more. Ave shall be the wife of Strokor!\" And so it was arranged.\n\nWell, and there ye have the story of Strokor, the mightiest man in the\nworld, and the wisest. More than this I shall not tell with my own lips;\nI shall have singers recite my deeds until half the compartments in the\nHouse of Words is filled with the records thereof. But it were well that\nI should tell this much in mine own way.\n\nMy ambition is fulfilled. Let the hand of Jon descend upon our world, if\nit may; I care not if presently the sun come nearer, and the water dry\nup, and the days grow longer and longer, till the day and the year\nbecome of the same length. I care not; my people, such as be left of\nthem, shall own what there is, and shall live as long as life is\npossible.\n\nI shall leave behind no race of weaklings. Every man shall be fit to\nlive, and the fittest of them all shall live the longer. And he, no\nmatter how many cycles hence, shall look back to Strokor, and to Ave,\nhis wife, and shall say:\n\n\"I am what I am, the last man on the world, because Strokor was the\nfittest man of his time!\"\n\nAye; my fame shall live as long as there be life. Tonight, as I speak\nthese things into the word machine, my heart is singing with the joy of\nit all. Thank Jon, I were born a man, not a woman!\n\nTomorrow I go to fetch Ave. I shall not send for her; I cannot trust her\nbeauty to the hands of my crew. The more I think of her, the more I see\nthat mine whole life hath been devised for this one moment. I see that,\ninsignificant though she be, Ave is a needed link in the chain. I have\ncome to want her more than food; I am become a lovesick fool!\n\nAye! I can afford to poke fun at myself. I can afford anything in this\nworld; for I be its greatest man.\n\nIts greatest man! Here is the place to stop. There is no more I can say,\nthe story is done; the story of Strokor, the greatest man in the whole\nworld!\n\n\n\nVII\n\nTHE GOING\n\n\n'Tis several years since last I faced this machine, many and many a day\nsince I said that my story was done, and placed the record on the shelf\nof my anteroom, my heart full of satisfaction. And today I must needs\nadd another record, perhaps two, to the pile.\n\nWhen I set out for the highlands on the morn following what I last\nrelated I took with me but two or three men; not that I had any need for\nguards, but because it looketh not well for the emperor to travel\nwithout retainers, however few. Practically, I was alone.\n\nI reached the locality as the sun went down. The sky was a brilliant\ncolor; I remember it well. Darkness would come soon, though not as\nquickly as farther south. Commonly, I think not upon such trifles; but I\nwere nearing my love, and tender things came easily to my mind.\n\nMy chariot kept to the road which lay alongside the irrigating flume, a\nstone trough which runs from the snow-covered hills to the dry country\nbelow. I had already noted this flume where it emptied into the basin in\nthe valley below; for it had had a new kind of a spillway affixed to it,\na broad, smooth platform with a slightly upward curve, over which the\nwater was shooting. I saw no sense in the arrangement, and made up my\nmind to ask Maka about it; for the empire prized this trough most\nhighly. It ran straight and true, over expensive bridges where needed,\nwith scarce a bend to hold back the flow.\n\nWhen I stopped my car outside the house I was surprised that none should\ncome out to greet me. Maka had sent word of my coming; all should have\nbeen in readiness. But I was forced to use my whistle. There was no\nstir. I became angry; I told my bullies to stay where they were, and\nmyself burst in the door.\n\nThe house was a sturdy stone affair of one floor, set against the side\nof the mountain, a short distance above the flume. I looked about the\ninterior in surprise; for not a soul was in sight in any of the\ncompartments. There were signs that people had been there but a few\nmoments before. I called it strange, for I had seen no one leave the\nhouse as I approached.\n\nAt last, as I was inspecting the eating place, I noted a small door let\ninto the outer wall. It was open; and by squeezing I managed to get\nthrough. I found that it let into a long, dark passage.\n\nI followed this, going steadily down a flight of stairs, and all of a\nsudden bumped into an iron grating. At the same moment I saw that the\npassageway made a turn just beyond; and by craning my neck and straining\nmy eyes I could see a faintly lighted chamber just a few feet away.\n\nAnd before my eyes could scarce make out the figures of some people in\nthe middle of the place, a voice came to my ear.\n\n\"Hail, Strokor!\" it said; and great was my astonishment as I recognized\nthe tones of Edam, the young dreamer whom Maka had brought to my house.\n\n\"Edam!\" I cried. \"What do ye here? Come and open these bars!\"\n\nHe made no reply, save to laugh in a way I did not like. I shook the\ngrating savagely, so that I felt it give. \"Edam!\" I roared. \"Open this\ngrating at once; and tell me, where is Ave?\"\n\n\"I am here,\" came another voice; and I stopped in sheer surprise, to\npeer closer and to see, for the first time, that it were really the\ndreamer and the chit, these two and no more, who sat there in the\nunderground chamber. They seemed to be sitting in some sort of a box,\nwith glass windows.\n\n\"Ave--come here!\" I spoke much more gently than to Edam; for my heart\nwas soft with thoughts of her. \"It is thy lord, Strokor, the emperor,\nwho calls thee. Come!\"\n\n\"I stay here,\" said she in the same clear voice, entirely unshaken by my\npresence. \"Edam hath claimed me, and I shall cleave to him. I want none\nof ye, ye giant!\"\n\nFor a moment I was minded to throw my weight against the barrier, such\nwas my rage. Then I thought better on it, and closely examined the bars.\nTwo were loose.\n\n\"Ave,\" said I, contriving to keep my voice even, although my hands were\nbusy with the bars as I spake. \"Ave--ye do wrong to spite me thus. Know\nye not that I am the emperor, and that these bars cannot stand before\nme? I warn ye, if I must call my men to help me, and to witness my\nshame, it will go hard with ye! Better that ye should come willingly. Ye\nare not for such as Edam.\"\n\n\"No?\" quoth the young man, speaking up for the chit. \"Ye are wrong,\nStrokor. We defy thee to do thy worst; we are prepared to flee from ye\nat all costs!\"\n\nI had twisted one of the bars out of my way without their seeing it. I\nstrove at the next as I answered, still controlling my voice: \"'Twill do\nye no good to flee, Edam; ye know that. And as for Ave--she shall wish\nshe had never been born!\"\n\n\"So I should,\" she replied with spirit, \"if I were to become thy woman.\nBut know you, Strokor, that Ave, the daughter of Durok, would rather die\nthan take the name of one who had spurned her, as ye did me!\"\n\nSo I had; it had slipped my mind. \"But I want thee now, Ave,\" said I\nsoftly, preparing to slip through the opening I had made. \"Surely ye\nwould not take thine own life?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" she answered, with a laugh in her voice. \"Rather I would go with\nEdam here. I would go,\" she finished, her voice rising in her\nexcitement, \"away from this horrible man's world; away from it all,\nStrokor, and to Jeos! Hear ye? To Jeos! And--\"\n\nBut at that instant I burst through the grating. Without a sound I\ncharged straight for the pair of them. And without a sound they slipped\naway from before my grasp. Next second I was gazing stupidly at the\nrushing, swirling water of the flume.\n\nAnd I saw that they had been sitting in the cabin of a tiny boat, and\nthat they had got away!\n\nThere was an opening into the outer air; I rushed through, and stared in\nthe growing twilight down the black furrow of the flume. Far in the\ndistance, and going like a streak, I spied the glittering glass windows\nof the little craft. Once I made out the flutter of a saucy hand.\n\n\"We shall get them when they reach the valley!\" I shouted to the men.\nThen I reached for my tube, and sighted it on the lower end of the\nflume, far, far below, almost too far away to be clear to the naked eye.\n\nIn an incredibly short time the craft reached the end. It traveled at an\nextraordinary rate; perchance 'twas weighted; I marveled that its\nwindows could stand the force of the air. And I scarce had time to fear\nthat the twain should be destroyed on that upturned spillway before it\nwas there.\n\nAnd then an awesome thing happened. As the boat struck the incline it\nshot upward into the air at a steep slant. Up, up it went; my heart\njumped into my mouth; for surely they must be crushed when they came\ndown.\n\nBut the craft did not come down. It went on and on, up and up; its speed\nscarcely slackened; 'twas like that of a shooting star. And in far less\ntime than it takes to tell it, the little boat was high up among the\nstars, going higher every instant, and farther away from me. And\nsuddenly the sweat broke cold on my forehead; for dead ahead, directly\nin line with their travel, lay the bluish white gleam of Jeos.\n\nSo great was my rage over the escape of the dreamer with my woman, at\nfirst I felt no sorrow. Later, after days and days of search in and\nabout the basin, I came to grieve most terribly over my loss. When I\ncame home to the palace, I was well-nigh ill.\n\nIn vain did I make the most generous of rewards. The whole empire turned\nout to search for the missing ones, but nothing came of it all. Yet I\nnever ceased to hope, especially after my talk with Maka.\n\n\"Aye,\" he said, when I questioned him, \"it were barely possible that\nthey have left this world for all time. I have calculated the speed\nwhich their craft might have attained, had it the right proportions,\nand, in truth, it might have left the spillway at such a speed that it\nentirely overcame the draw of the ground.\n\n\"But I think it were a slim chance. It is more than likely, Strokor,\nthat Ave shall return to thee.\"\n\nWas I not the fitter man? Surely Edam's purpose could not succeed; Jon\nwould not have it so. The woman was mine, because I had chosen her; and\nshe must come back to me, and in safety, or I should tear Edam into\nbits.\n\nBut as time went on and naught transpired, I became more and more\nmelancholy. Life became an empty thing; it had been empty enough before\nI had craved the girl, but now it was empty with hopelessness.\n\nAfter a while I got to thinking of some of the things Maka had told me.\nThe more I thought of the future, the blacker it seemed. True, there\nwere many other women; but there had been only one Ave. No such beauty\nhad ever graced this world before. And I knew I could be happy with no\nother.\n\nNow I saw that all my fame had been in vain. I had lost the only woman\nthat was fit for me, and when I died there would be naught left but my\nname. Even that the next emperor might blot out, if he chose. It had all\nbeen in vain!\n\n\"It shall not be!\" I roared to myself, as I strode about my compartment,\ngnawing at my hands in my misery. And in just such a fit of helpless\nanger the great idea came to me.\n\nNo sooner conceived than put into practice. I will not go closely into\ndetails; I will relate just the outstanding facts. What I did was to\nselect a very tall mountain, located almost on the equator, and\nproclaimed my intention to erect a monument to Jon upon its summit. I\ncaused vast quanities of materials to be brought to the place; and for a\nyear a hundred thousand men labored to put the pieces together.\n\nWhen they had finished, they had made a mammoth tower partly of wood and\npartly of alloy. It was made in sections so that it might be placed,\npiece upon piece, one above another high into the sky.\n\nIt was an enormous task. When it was complete, I had a tower as high as\nthe mountain itself erected upon its summit.\n\nAnd next I caused section after section of the long, iron, pole-to-pole\nrod, which had tricked Klow, to be hauled up into the tower. I was only\ncareful to begin the process from the top and work downward. I gave word\nthat the last three sections be inserted at midday at a given day.\n\nAnd at that hour I was safe inside a non-magnetic room.\n\nI know right well when the deed was done. There was a most terrific\nearthquake. All about me, though I could see nothing at all, I could\nhear buildings falling. The din was appalling.\n\nAt the same time the air was fairly shattered with the rattle of the\nlightning. Never have I heard the like before. The rod had loosed the\nwrath of the forces above our air!\n\nAnd as suddenly the whole deafening storm ended. Perchance the rod was\ndestroyed by the lightning; I never went to see. For I know, the\nelectricity split the very ground apart. But I gazed out of a window in\nthe top of my palace, and saw that I had succeeded.\n\nNot a soul but myself remained alive.\n\nNone but buildings made of the alloy were standing. Not only man, but\nmost of his works had perished in that awful blast. I, alone, remained!\n\nI, Strokor, am the survivor! I, the greatest man; it were but fit that I\nshould be the last! No man shall come after me, to honor me or not as he\nchooses. I, and no other, shall be, the last man!\n\nAnd when Ave returns--as she must, though it be ages hence--when she\ncomes, she shall find me waiting. I, Strokor, the mighty and wise, shall\nbe here when she returns. I shall wait for her forever; here I shall\nalways stay. The stars may move from their places, but I shall not go!\nFor it is my intention to make use of another secret Maka taught me. In\nbrief--[Footnote: The record ends here. It may be that Strokor left the\nmachine for some trivial reason, and forgot to finish his story. At all\nevents, it is necessary to refer to the further discoveries of the\nexpedition in order to learn the outcome of it all.]\n\n\n\nPART III\n\nTHE SURVIVOR\n\n\nProvided with a sledge-hammer, a crowbar, and a hydraulic jack, and even\nwith drills and explosives as a last resort, Jackson, Kinney, and Van\nEmmon returned the same day to the walled-in room in the top of that\nmystifying mansion. The materials they carried would have made\nconsiderable of a load had not Smith removed enough of the weights from\ntheir suits to offset their burden. They reached the unopened door\nwithout special exertion, and with no mishap.\n\nThey looked in vain for a crack big enough to hold the point of the\ncrowbar; neither could the most vigorous jabbing loosen any of the\nmaterial. They dropped that tool and tried the sledge. It got no\nresults; even in the hands of the husky geologist, the most vigorous\nblows failed to budge the door. They did not even dent it.\n\nSo they propped the powerful hydraulic jack, a tool sturdy enough to\nlift a house, at an angle against the door. Then, using the crowbar as a\nlever, the architect steadily turned up the screw, the mechanism\nmultiplying his very ordinary strength a hundredfold. In a moment it\ncould be seen that he was getting results; the door began to stir. Van\nEmmon struck one edge with the sledge-hammer, and it gave slightly.\n\nIn another minute the whole door, weighing over a ton, had been pushed\nalmost out of its opening. The jack overbalanced, toppled over; they did\nnot readjust it, but threw their combined weight upon the barrier.\n\nThere was no need to try again. With a shiver the huge slab of metal\nslid, upright, into the space beyond, stood straight on end for a second\nor so, then toppled to the floor.\n\nAND THIS TIME THEY HEARD THE CRASH.\n\nFor, as the door fell, a great gust of wind rushed out with a hissing\nshriek, almost overbalancing the men from the earth. They stood still\nfor a while, breathing hard from their exertion, trying in vain to peer\ninto the blackness before them. Under no circumstances would either of\nthem have admitted that he was gathering courage.\n\nIn a minute the architect, his eyes sparkling with his enthusiasm for\nthe antique, picked up the electric torch and turned it into the\ncompartment. As he did so the other two stepped to his side, so that the\nthree of them faced the unknown together. It was just as well. Outlined\nin that circle of light, and not six feet in front of them, stood a\ngreat chair upon a wide platform; and seated in it, erect and alert, his\nwide open eyes staring straight into those of the three, was the\nfrightful mountainous form of Strokor, the giant, himself.\n\nFor an indeterminable length of time the men from the earth stood there,\nspeechless, unbreathing, staring at that awful monster as though at a\nnightmare. He did not move; he was entirely at ease, and yet plainly on\nguard, glaring at them with an air of conscious superiority which held\nthem powerless. Instinctively they knew that the all-dominating voice in\nthe records had belonged to this Hercules. But their instinct could not\ntell them whether the man still lived.\n\nIt was the doctor's brain that worked first. Automatically, from a\nlifelong habit of diagnosis, he inspected that dreadful figure quite as\nthough it were that of a patient. Bit by bit his subconscious mind\npieced together the evidence; the man in the chair showed no signs of\nlife. And after a while the doctor's conscious mind also knew.\n\n\"He is dead,\" he said positively, in his natural voice; and such was the\nvast relief of the other two that they were in no way startled by the\nsound. Instantly all three drew long breaths; the tension was relaxed;\nand Van Emmon's curiosity found a harsh and unsteady voice.\n\n\"How under heaven has he been preserved all this time? Especially,\" he\nadded, remembering, \"considering the air that we found in the room?\"\n\nThe doctor answered after a moment, his reply taking the form of\nadvancing a step or two and holding out a hand. It touched glass.\n\nFor the first time since the discovery, the builder shifted the light.\nHe had held it as still as death for a full minute. Now he flashed it\nall about the place, and they saw that the huge figure was entirely\nencased in glass. The cabinet measured about six feet on each of its\nsides, and about five feet in height; but such were the squat\nproportions of the occupant that he filled the whole space.\n\nA slight examination showed that the case was not fixed to the platform,\nbut had a separate bottom, upon which the stumplike chair was set. Also,\nthey found that, thanks to the reduced pull of the planet, it was not\nhard for the three of them to lift the cabinet bodily, despite its\nweight of almost a thousand pounds. They left the tools lie there,\ndiscarded as much weight as they could, and proceeded to carry that\nages-old superman out into the light.\n\nHere they could see that the great man was all but a negro in color. It\nwas equally clear, however, from an examination of his mammoth cranium\nand extraordinary expression, that he was as highly developed along most\nmental lines as the greatest men on earth. It was the back of his head,\nhowever, so flat that it was only a continuation of his neck, or,\nrather, shoulders, that told where the flaw lay. That, together with the\nhardness of his eye, the cruelty of his mouth, and the absolute lack of\nsoftness anywhere in the ironlike face or frame--all this condemned the\nmonster for what he was; inhuman.\n\nIt was not easy to get him down the two flights of stairs. More than\nonce they had to prop the case on a step while they rested; and at one\ntime, just before they reached that curious heap of rubbish at the foot\nof the upper stairs, Jackson's strength gave way and it looked as though\nthe whole thing would get away from them. Van Emmon saved it at the cost\nof a bruised shoulder.\n\nOnce at the bottom of the lower flight, the rest was easy. Within a very\nfew minutes the astonished face of the engineer was peering into the\nvestibule; he could hardly wait until the air-tight door was locked\nbefore opening the inner valves. He stared at the mammoth figure in the\ncase long and hard, and from then on showed a great deal of respect for\nhis three friends.\n\nOf course, at that time the members of the expedition did not understand\nthe conditions of Mercury as they are now known. They had to depend upon\nthe general impression they got from their first-hand investigations;\nand it is remarkable that the doctor should have guessed so close to the\ntruth.\n\n\"He must have made up his mind to outlast everybody else,\" was the way\nhe put it as he kicked off his suit. He stepped up to the cabinet and\nfelt of the glass. \"I wish it were possible, without breaking the case,\nto see how he was embalmed.\"\n\nHis fingers still rested on the glass. Suddenly his eyes narrowed; he\nran his fingers over the entire surface of the pane, and then whirled to\nstare at a thermometer.\n\n\"That's mighty curious!\" he ejaculated. \"This thing was bitter cold when\nwe brought it in! Now it's already as warm as this car!\"\n\nSmith's eyes lit up. \"It may be,\" he offered, \"that the case doesn't\ncontain a vacuum, but some gas which has an electrical affinity for our\natmosphere.\"\n\n\"Or,\" exclaimed the geologist suddenly, \"the glass itself may be totally\ndifferent from ours. It may be made of--\"\n\n\"GOD!\" shouted the doctor, jerking his hand from the cabinet and leaping\nstraight backward. At the same instant, with a grinding crash, all three\nsides of the case collapsed and fell in splinters to the floor.\n\n\"Look out!\" shrieked Jackson. He was staring straight into the now\nunhooded eyes of the giant. He backed away, stumbled against a stool,\nand fell to the floor in a dead faint. Smith fumbled impotently with a\nhammer. The doctor was shaking like a leaf.\n\nBut Van Emmon stood still in his tracks, his eyes fixed on the Goliath;\nhis fingernails gashed the palms of his hands but he would not budge.\nAnd as he stared he saw, from first to last, the whole ghastly change\nthat came, after billions of years of waiting, to the sole survivor of\nMercury.\n\nA glaze swept over the huge figure. Next instant every line in that\nadamant frame lost its strength; the hardness left the eyes and mouth.\nThe head seemed to sink lower into the massive shoulders, and the\nirresistible hands relaxed. In another second the thing that had once\nbeen as iron had become as rubber.\n\nBut only for an instant. Second by second that huge mountain of muscle\nslipped and jellied and actually melted before the eyes of the humans.\nAt the same time a curious acrid odor arose; Smith fell to coughing. The\ndoctor turned on more oxygen.\n\nIn less than half a minute the man who had once conquered a planet was\nreduced to a steaming mound of brownish paste. As it sank to the floor\nof the case, it touched a layer of coarse yellow powder sprinkled there;\nand it was this that caused the vapor. In a moment the room was filled\nwith the haze of it; luckily, the doctor's apparatus worked well.\n\nAnd thus it came about that, within five minutes from being exposed to\nthe air of the sky-car, that whole immense bulk, chair and all, had\nvanished. The powder had turned it to vapor, and the purifying chemicals\nhad sucked it up. Nothing was left save a heap of smoking, grayish ashes\nin the center of the broken glass.\n\nVan Emmon's fingers relaxed their grip. He stirred to action, and turned\nbriskly to Smith.\n\n\"Here! Help me with this thing!\"\n\nBetween them they got the remains of the cabinet, with its gruesome\nload, into the vestibule. As for the doctor, he was bending over\nJackson's still unconscious form. When he saw what the others were\ndoing, he gave a great sigh of relief.\n\n\"Good!\" He helped them close the door. \"Let's get away from this damned\nplace!\"\n\nThe outer door was opened. At the same time Smith started the machinery;\nand as the sky-car shot away from the ground he tilted it slightly, so\nthat the contents of the vestibule was slid into space. Down it fell\nlike so much lead.\n\nThe doctor glanced through a nearby window, and his face brightened as\nhe made out the distant gleam of another planet. He watched the receding\nsurface of Mercury with positive delight.\n\n\"Nice place to get away from,\" he commented. \"And now, my friends, for\nVenus, and then--home!\"\n\nBut the other's eyes were fixed upon a tiny sparkle in the dust outside\nthe palace, where the vestibule had dropped its load. It was the sun\nshining upon some broken bits of glass; the glass which, for untold\nages, had enclosed the throne of the Death-lord.\n\n\n\nPart IV\n\nTHE QUEEN OF LIFE\n\nI\n\nNEXT STOP, VENUS!\n\n\nWhen he first got the idea of the sky-car, the doctor never stopped to\nconsider whether he was the right man for such an excursion. Personally,\nhe hated travel. He was merely a general practitioner, with a great\nfondness for astronomy; and the sole reason why he wanted to visit the\nplanets was that he couldn't see them well enough with his telescope. So\nhe dabbled a little in magnetism and so forth, and stumbled upon the\nprinciple of the cube.\n\nBut he had no mechanical ability, and was on the point of giving up the\nscheme when he met Smith. He was instantly impressed by the engineer's\nhighly commonplace face; he had had considerable experience with human\ncontrariness, and felt sure that Smith must be an absolute wonder, since\nhe looked so very ordinary.\n\nKinney's diagnosis proved correct. Smith knew his business; the\nmachinery was finished in a hurry and done right. However, when it came\nto fitting the outfit into a suitable sky-car, Kinney was obliged to\ncall in an architect. That accounts for E. Williams Jackson. At the same\ntime, it occurred to the doctor that they would need a cook. Mrs. Kinney\nhad refused to have anything whatever to do with the trip, and so Kinney\nput an ad in the paper. As luck would have it, Van Emmon, the geologist,\nwho had learned how to cook when he first became a mountaineer, saw the\nad and answered it in hope of adventure.\n\nThe doctor himself, besides his training in the mental and bodily\nfrailities of human beings, had also an unusual command of the related\nsciences, such as biology. Smith's specialties have already been named;\nhe could drive an airplane or a nail with equal ease. Van Emmon, as a\npart of his profession, was a skilled \"fossilologist,\" and was well up\nin natural history.\n\nAs for E. Williams Jackson--the architect was also the sociologist of\nthe four. Moreover, he had quite a reputation as an amateur antiquarian.\nNevertheless, the most important thing about E. Williams Jackson was not\nlearned until after the visit to Mercury, after the terrible end of that\nexploration, after the architect, falling in a faint, had been revived\nunder the doctor's care.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Kinney, coming from the secluded nook among the\ndynamos which had been the architect's bunk; \"gentlemen, I must inform\nyou that Jackson is not what we thought.\n\n\"He--I mean, she--is a woman!\"\n\nWhich put an entirely new face upon matters. The three men, discussing\nit, marveled that the architect had been able to keep her sex a secret\nall the time they were exploring at Mercury. They did not know that none\nof E. Williams Jackson's fellow architects had ever guessed the truth.\nAmbitious and ingenious, with a natural liking for house-planning, she\nhad resolved that her sex should not stand in the way of success.\n\nAnd when she finally came to herself, there in her bunk, and suspected\nthat her secret was out--instead of shame or embarrassment she felt only\nchagrin. She walked, rather unsteadily, across the floor of the great\ncube-shaped car to the window where the three were standing; and as they\nquietly made a place for her, she took it entirely as a matter of\ncourse, and without a word.\n\nThe doctor had been speaking of the peculiar fitness of the four for\nwhat they were doing. \"And if I'm not mistaken,\" he went on, \"we're\ngoing to need all the brains we can pool, when we get to Venus.\n\n\"I never would have claimed, when we started out, that Mercury had ever\nbeen inhabited. But now that we've seen what we've seen, I feel dead\nsure that Venus once was peopled.\"\n\nThe four looked out the triple-glazed vacuum-insulated window at the\nsteadily growing globe of \"Earth's twin sister.\" Half in sunlight and\nhalf in shadow, this planet, for ages the synonym for beauty, was now\nbut a million miles away. She looked as large as the moon; but instead\nof a silvery gleam, she showed a creamy radiance fully three times as\nbright.\n\n\"Let's see,\" reflected the geologist aloud. \"As I recall it, the\nbrightness of a planet depends upon the amount of its air. That would\nindicate, then, that Venus has about as much as the earth, wouldn't it?\"\nremembering how the home planet had looked when they left it.\n\nThe doctor nodded. \"There are other factors; but undoubtedly we are\napproaching a world which is a great deal like our own. Venus is nearly\nas large as the earth, has about nine-tenths the surface, and a gravity\nalmost as strong. The main difference is that she's only two-thirds as\nfar from the sun as we are.\"\n\n\"How long is her day?\" Smith wanted to know.\n\n\"Can't say. Some observers claim to have seen her clearly enough to\nannounce a day of the same length as ours. Others calculate that she's\nlike Mercury; always the same face toward the sun. If so, her day is\nalso her year--two hundred and twenty-five of our days.\"\n\nVan Emmon looked disappointed. \"In that case she would be blistering hot\non one side and freezing cold on the other; except,\" remembering\nMercury, \"except for the 'twilight zone,' where the climate would be\nneither one nor the other, but temperate.\" He pointed to the line down\nthe middle of the disk before them, the line which divided the lighted\nfrom the unlighted, the day from the night.\n\nThe four looked more intently. It should be remembered that the very\nbrilliance of Venus has always hindered the astronomers; the planet as a\nwhole is always very conspicuous but its very glare makes it impossible\nto see any details. The surface has always seemed to be covered by a\nveil of hazy, faintly streaked vapor.\n\nSmith gave a queer exclamation. For a moment or two he stared hard at\nthe planet; then looked up with an apologetic grin.\n\n\"I had a foolish idea. I thought--\" He checked himself. \"Say, doesn't\nVenus remind you of something?\"\n\nThe doctor slowly shook his head. \"Can't say that it does, Smith. I have\nalways considered Venus as having an appearance peculiarly her own.\nWhy?\"\n\nThe engineer started to answer, stopped, thought better of it, and\ninstead pointed out the half that was in shadow. \"Why is it that we can\nmake out the black portion so easily?\"\n\nKinney could answer this. \"The fact is, it isn't really black at all,\nbut faintly lighted. Presumably it is star-shine.\"\n\n\"Star-shine!\" echoed the architect, interested.\n\n\"Just that. You see,\" finished the doctor, \"if that side is never turned\ntoward the sun, then it must be covered with ice, which would reflect\nthe star--\"\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Smith with satisfaction. \"I wasn't so crazy after all!\nMy notion was that the whole blamed thing is covered with ice!\"\n\nIt looked reasonable. Certainly the entire sphere had a somewhat watery\nappearance. It prompted the geologist to say:\n\n\"Kinney--if that reflection is really due to ice, then there must be\nplenty of water vapor in the air. And if that's the case--\"\n\n\"Not only is life entirely possible,\" stated the doctor quietly, \"but\nI'll bet you this sky-car against an abandoned soap-stone mine that we\nfind humans, or near-human beings there when we land tomorrow!\"\n\n\n\nII\n\nSPEAKING OF VENUS\n\n\nThe architect was still dressed in the fashionably cut suit of men's\nclothes she had worn while in the car. Van Emmon thought of this when he\nsaid, somewhat awkwardly:\n\n\"Well, I'm going to fix something to eat. It'll be ready in half an\nhour, Miss--er--Jackson.\"\n\nShe looked at him, slightly puzzled; then understood. \"You mean to give\nme time to change my clothes? Thanks; but I'm used to these. And\nbesides,\" with spirit, \"I never could see why women couldn't wear what\nthey choose, so long as it is decent.\"\n\nThere was no denying that hers were both becoming and \"decent.\" Modeled\nafter the usual riding costume, both coat and breeches were youthfully,\nrather than mannishly, tailored; and the narrow, vertical stripe of the\ndark gray material served to make her slenderness almost girlish. In\nshort, what with her poet-style hair, her independent manner and direct\nspeech, she was far more like a boy of twenty than a woman nearing\nthirty.\n\nShe walked with Van Emmon, dodging machinery all the way, across the big\ncar to the little kitchenette over which he had presided. There, to his\ndismay, the girl took off her coat, rolled up her sleeves, and announced\nher intention of helping.\n\n\"You're a good cook, Van--I mean, Mr.--\"\n\n\"Let it go at Van, please,\" said he hastily. \"My first name is Gustave,\nbut nobody has ever used it since I was christened.\"\n\n\"Same with my 'Edna,' she declared. \"Mother's name was Williams, and I\nwas nicknamed 'Billie' before I can remember. So that's settled,\" with\ngreat firmness. The point is--Van--you're a good cook, but everything\ntastes of bacon. I wish you'd let me boss this meal.\"\n\nHe looked rebellious for an instant, then gave a sigh of relief. \"I'm\nreally tickled to death.\"\n\nA little later the doctor and Smith, looking across, saw Van Emmon being\ninitiated into the system which constructs scalloped potatoes. Next, he\nwas discovering that there is more than one way to prepare dried beef.\n\n\"For once, we won't cream it,\" said E. Billie Jackson, dryly, as Van\nEmmon laid down the can-opener. \"We'll make an omelet out of it, and see\nif anything happens.\"\n\nShe was already beating the eggs. He cut up the meat into small pieces,\nand when he was finished, took the egg-beater away from her. He turned\nit so energetically that a speck of foam flew into his face.\n\n\"Go slow,\" she advised, nonchalantly reaching up with a dish-towel and\nwiping the fleck away. Whereupon he worked the machine more furiously\nthan ever.\n\nSoon he was wondering how on earth he had come to assume, all along,\nthat she was not a woman. He now saw that what he had previously\nconsidered boyishness in her was, in fact, simply the vigor and\nfreshness of an earnest, healthy, energetic girl. It dawned upon him\nthat her keen, gray eyes were not sharp, but alert; her mouth, not hard,\nbut resolute; her whole expression, instead of mannish, just as womanly\nas that of any girl who has been thrown upon her own resources, and made\ngood. He soon found that his eyesight did not suffer in any way because\nhe looked at her.\n\n\"Now,\" she remarked, in her businesslike way, as she placed the brimming\npan into the oven, \"I suppose that I'll hear various hints to the effect\nthat a woman has no business trying to do men's stunts. And I warn you\nright now that I'm prepared to put up a warm argument!\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said the geologist, with such gravity that the girl knew he\ndidn't mean it; \"of course a woman's place is in the home. Surrounded by\nseventeen or eighteen children, and cooking for that many more hired men\nbesides, she is simply ideal. We realize that.\"\n\n\"Then, admitting that much, why shouldn't a woman be as independent as\nshe likes? Think what women did during the war; remember what a lot of\nwomen are doctors and lawyers! Is there any good reason why I couldn't\ndesign a library as well as a man could?\"\n\n\"None at all,\" agreed Van Emmon, handing over the dish of chopped meat.\nThe girl carefully folded the contents into the now spongelike omelet as\nhe went on: \"By the way, a neighbor of mine told me, just before I left,\nthat he was having trouble with a broken sewer. How'd you like to--\"\n\n\"About as well as you'd like to darn socks!\" she came back, evidently\nbeing primed for such comments. She took a look at the potatoes, and\nthen permitted the geologist to open their sixth can of peaches. \"I must\nsay they're good,\" she admitted, as she noted the eagerness with which\nhe obeyed.\n\nBread and butter, olives, coffee and cake completed that meal. The table\nwas set with more care than usual, a clean cloth and napkins being\nunearthed for the occasion. When Smith and Kinney were called, both\ndeclared that they weren't hungry enough to do justice to it all.\n\n\"It's just as well you weren't very hungry,\" commented Billie, as she\nfinished giving each of them a second helping of the potatoes. \"There's\nbarely enough left for me,\" and she took it.\n\n\"Say, I never thought of it before, Miss--er--Miss Billie,\" said Smith\ncoloring; \"but you eat just as much as a man!\"\n\n\"Ye gods, how shocking!\" she jeered. \"Come to think of it, Smith, you\neat MORE than a woman!\"\n\nThe doctor's face grew red with some suppressed emotion. After a while\nhe said soberly: \"I'll tell you what's worrying Smith. He's afraid that\nwomen, having suddenly become very progressive, will forge entirely\nahead of men. You understand--having started, they can't stop. And I\nmust admit that I've thought seriously of it at times myself.\"\n\n\"Me too,\" added Van Emmon earnestly. \"I have the same feeling about it\nthat an elderly man must have when he sees a young one get on the job.\nInstead of being glad that the women are making good, I sort of resent\nit.\"\n\n\"I knew it!\" exclaimed the girl delightedly. \"But I never heard a man\nadmit it before!\"\n\n\"Perhaps it isn't as serious as we think,\" said the practical Smith,\nscraping the bottom of the potato pan. \"I believe that the progress of\nwomen may have a fine effect upon men, making us less self-satisfied,\nand more alert. For one thing,\" glancing about the cube, \"we've got to\nclean up a bit, now that we know you're a woman!\"\n\nThe architect's eyes flashed. \"Because you know mighty well I'll light\nin and do it myself, if you don't; that's what you mean! Please take\nnotice that I'm to be respected, not because of what I AM, but because\nof what I can DO!\"\n\n\"In behalf of myself and companions, I surrender!\" said the doctor\ngallantly. Then he instantly added: \"And yet, even when we are actually\nchivalrous, we are disregarding your desire to be appreciated for what\nyou are worth. Pardon me, Miss Billie; I'll not forget again.\n\n\"At the same time, my dear,\" remembering that he had a daughter of his\nown, nearly the builder's age, \"we men have come to think of women\nprimarily as potential mothers, and secondarily as people of affairs.\nAnd considering that motherhood is something that is denied to us lords\nof the earth--\"\n\n\"For which we can thank a merciful Providence,\" interjected the girl\nsolemnly.\n\n\"Considering this--excuse my seriousness--really amazing fact, you can't\nblame us for expecting women to fulfil this vital function before taking\nup other matters.\"\n\n\"Yes?\" remarked the girl, watching the peaches with anxious eye as Van\nEmmon helped himself. \"Funny; but I always understood that the first\nfunction of man was to father the race; yet, invariably the young\nfellows try to make names for themselves before, not after, they marry!\"\n\n\"Scalped!\" chuckled Van Emmon, as the doctor hid his discomfiture behind\na large piece of cake. \"You may know a lot about Venus, doc, but you\ndon't know much about women!\"\n\n\"Speaking about Venus,\" Smith was reminded, \"we may learn something\nbearing upon the very point we have been discussing if Kinney's right\nabout the inhabitants.\"\n\nThe doctor nodded eagerly. \"You see, if there's people still alive on\nthe planet, they're probably further advanced than we on the earth.\nOther things being equal, of course. Being a smaller planet than ours,\nshe cooled off sooner, and thus became fit for life earlier. And having\nbeen made from the same 'batch,' to use Van's expression, that Mercury\nand all the rest were, why, in all likelihood evolution has taken place\nthere much the same as with us, only sooner.\n\n\"I should expect,\" he elaborated largely, \"that we shall find the\ninhabitants much the same as we humans, only extremely civilized. It may\nbe that they are as far above us as we are above monkeys.\"\n\nSmith broke in by quoting an astronomer who contended that Venus kept\nonly one face toward the sun. \"Maybe she always did, Kinney.\"\n\nThe doctor shook his head. \"See how perfectly round she is? No\noblateness whatever. It proves that she once revolved, otherwise she'd\nbe pear-shaped, from the sun's pull.\"\n\nThere was a short silence, during which Billie concluded that the only\nscraps left would be the coffee-grounds. Then Van Emmon pushed away from\nthe table, got to his feet, stretched a little to relieve his nerves,\nand said:\n\n\"Well, whatever we find on Venus, I hope the women do the cooking!\"\n\n\n\nIII\n\nTHE FIRST VENUSIAN\n\n\nWhen the sky-car was within a thousand miles of the surface, Smith\nadjusted the currents so that the floor was directed downward. The four\nchanged from the window to the deadlight, and watched the approaching\ndisk with every bit of the excitement and interest they had felt when\nnearing Mercury.\n\nThe doctor had warned them that the heavy atmosphere which Venus was\nknown to possess would prevent seeing as clearly as in the case of the\nsmaller planet. All were much disappointed, however, to find that they\nwere still unable to make out a single definite detail. The great half-\nshining, half-black world showed nothing but that vaguely streaked, ice-\nlike haze.\n\nThere was something very queer about it all. \"Strange that we should see\nno movement in those clouds,\" mused the doctor aloud. \"That is, if they\nreally are clouds.\"\n\nVan Emmon already doubted it. \"Just what I was thinking. There ought to\nbe terrific winds; yet, so far as I have seen, there's been nothing\ndoing anywhere on the surface since we first began to observe it.\"\n\nAfter a while the doctor put away his binoculars and rubbed his eyes.\n\"We might as well descend faster, Smith. Can't see a thing from here.\"\n\nUnhindered by air to impede its progress the sky-car had been hurtling\nthrough space at cometary speed. Now, however, Smith added the power of\nthe apparatus to the pull of the planet, so that the disk began to rush\ntoward them at a truly alarming rate. After a few seconds of it Billie\nfound herself unconsciously moving to the side of the geologist.\n\nHe looked down at her, understood, and flushed with pleasure. \"There's\nno danger,\" he confidently assured her, with the result that, her\ncourage fortified, the girl moved back to her place again. Van Emmon\ninwardly kicked himself.\n\nSo deceptive was that peculiar fogginess Smith throttled their descent\nas soon as they had reached the point where the planet's appearance\nchanged from round to flat. They were headed for the line which marked\nthe boundary of the shadow. This gray \"twilight zone\" was three or four\nhundred miles in width; on the right of it--to the east--the dazzling\nsurface of that sunlit vapor contrasted sharply with the all but black\nmistiness of the starward side. Clearly the zone ought to be temperate\nenough.\n\nDown they sank. As they came nearer a curious pinkish tint began to show\nbeneath them. Shortly it became more noticeable; the doctor gave a\nsudden grunt of satisfaction, and Smith stopped the car.\n\nA minute later the doctor had taken a sample of the surrounding ether\nthrough his laboratory test-vestibule; and shortly announced that they\nwere now floating in air instead of space.\n\n\"Good deal like ours back home, too\"--exultingly. \"Pretty thin, of\ncourse.\" He made a short calculation, referring to the aneroid barometer\nwhich was mounted on the outer frame of a window, and said he judged\nthat their altitude was about five miles.\n\nThe descent continued, Smith using the utmost caution. The other three\nkept their eyes glued to the deadlight; and their mystification was only\nequaled by their uneasiness as that motionless, bleary glaze failed\nabsolutely to show anything they had not seen a thousand miles higher.\nNot a single detail!\n\n\"It reminds me,\" said the girl in a low voice, \"of something I once saw\nfrom the top of a hill. It was the reflection of the sun from the\nsurface of a pond; not clear water, but covered with--\"\n\n\"Good Heavens!\" interrupted Van Emmon, struck with the thought. \"Can it\nbe that the whole planet is under water?\"\n\nBeyond a doubt his guess was justified. There was an oily smoothness\nabout that dazzling haze which made it remarkably like a lake of still\nand rather dirty water under a bright sun.\n\nBut the doctor said no. \"Any water I ever heard of would make clouds,\"\nsaid he; \"and we know there's air enough to guarantee plenty of wind.\nYet nothing seems to be in motion.\" He was frowning continually now.\n\nIt was Billie who first declared that she saw the surface. \"Stop,\" she\nsaid to Smith evenly, and he instantly obeyed. All four gathered around\nthe deadlight, and soon agreed that the peculiarly elusive skin of the\nplanet was actually within sight. However, it was like deciding upon the\ndistance of the moon--as easy to say that it were within arm's reach as\na long ways off.\n\nThe doctor went to a window. There he could look out upon the sun, a\npainfully bright object much larger than it looks from the Earth. It was\njust \"ascending,\" and half of it was below the horizon. A blinding\nstreak of light was reflected from a point on the surface not far from\nthe cube. Shading his eyes with his hand the doctor could see that the\nmysterious crust was absolutely smooth.\n\nOn the opposite side of the car the horizon ended in a sunrise glow of a\nslightly greenish radiance. From that side the pinkish tint of the\nsurface was quite pronounced.\n\nBefore going any lower the doctor, struck with an idea, declared: \"We\nalways want to remember that this car is perfectly soundproof. Suppose\nwe open the outer door of the vestibule. I imagine we'll learn something\npeculiar.\"\n\nIt was possible to open this door without touching the inner valves,\nusing mechanism concealed within the walls. The moment it was done--the\ndoor faced the \"north\"--pandemonium itself broke loose. A most terrific\nshrieking and howling came from the outside; it was wind, passing at a\nrate such as would make a hurricane seem a mere zephyr. The doctor\nclosed the door so that they could think.\n\n\"It's the draft,\" he concluded; \"the draft from the sun-warmed side to\nthe cold side.\"\n\nAs for Van Emmon, he was getting out a rope and a heavy leaden weight.\nOn the rope he formed knots every five feet, about twenty of them; and\nafter getting into one of the insulated, aluminum-armored and oxygen-\nhelmeted suits with which they had explored Mercury, he locked himself\non the other side of the inner vestibule door and proceeded to \"sound.\"\n\nTo the amazement of all except Billie \"bottom\" was reached in less than\ntwenty feet. \"I thought so,\" she said with satisfaction; but she was not\nat ease until Van Emmon had returned in safety from that booming,\nwhistling turmoil.\n\nHis first remark upon removing his helmet almost took them off their\nfeet. \"The point is,\" said he, throttling his excitement--\"the point is,\nthe rope was nearly jerked out of my hands!\n\n\"Understand what I mean? The surface is REVOLVING!\"\n\nThis upset every idea they had had; it never occurred to any of them\nthat the planet could revolve at such speed that it would appear\nstationary. Smith went at once to the eastern window and watched\nclosely, for fear some irregularity in that apparently perfect sphere\nmight catch them unawares. They did not learn till later that Venus's\nday is a little less than twenty-five hours, and therefore, since they\nhad approached her near the equator, the wind they had encountered was\nmoving at nearly nine hundred miles per hour!\n\nBit by bit, though, the cube answered to the wind-pressure. Soon they\nnoted the sun rising slowly; and by the time it was two hours high the\nsurface, which had been whizzing under them like some highly polished\ntop, became entirely motionless: The cube had \"stopped.\"\n\nOne minute later the car touched the level. Smith very slowly reduced\nthe repelling current so that the immense weight of the cube was but\ngradually shifted to the unknown surface beneath. Ton after ton was\nadded until--\n\n\"Stop!\" came from the doctor. He had noted through the window a slight\ncurvature in the material.\n\nSo the machinery was left in action. \"At any rate,\" said Smith, \"we know\nthat the confounded stuff isn't antimagnetic, whatever it is.\" Of course\nthis was true--even though the gelatinlike shell could not support the\ncube's weight, yet it did not insulate the planet from the repelling\ncurrent.\n\nThe thermometer registered three hundred and thirty-five degrees\nFahrenheit. \"Two hundred and eighty degrees higher than it would be at\nhome in the same latitude,\" remarked the doctor. \"We'll have to use the\nsuits.\" He took it for granted that exploration should begin at once.\n\nNo one stayed behind. The machines could be relied upon, as they knew\nfrom nearly two weeks of use, and certainly there was nothing in sight\nwhich could possibly interfere with the cube. Nevertheless, the matter-\nof-fact engineer took care to remove part of the door-operating\napparatus when he left the vestibule, and nobody commented upon it. It\nseemed the sensible thing to do; that was all.\n\nThere was just about enough additional weight in their suits to balance\nthe slightly reduced gravitation, so they moved about, four misshapen,\nmetallic hulks, with as much freedom as though back home. Always they\nkept within a few feet of each other so as to throw no strain on their\ninterconnecting telephone wires. The big, glass-faced helmets gave a\nremarkable sense of security.\n\nThey made a complete circuit of the cube, and at the end of it looked at\neach other in perplexity. Never, save in the middle of an ocean, in the\ndoldrums, did any man ever see such a totally barren spot. Not a tree,\nmuch less a sign of human occupation; there was not even the slightest\nmound. The planet was, in actual fact, as smooth and as bare as a\nbilliard ball!\n\nMoreover, the surface itself remained as mysterious as before. Of course\nthey did not touch it with bare hands--all wore insulated mittens--but\nthe dazzling stuff was certainly as hard as steel and as highly\npolished. It was neither transparent nor opaque, but translucent, \"like\npink mother-of-pearl,\" as Billie suggested.\n\nShe was the first to propose that they move to another spot. \"We ought\nto try a place where it's not yet dawn,\" said she, shielding her eyes\nfrom the glare. (It will be remembered that the suits protected them\nfrom the heat itself.) \"Can't see anything.\"\n\n\"Hush!\" hissed the doctor. They turned and followed his gaze to a spot\nnot thirty feet from where they stood.\n\nAt the same instant they felt a faint jar in the material under their\nfeet. And next second they saw that a large section of the supposedly\nsolid surface was in motion.\n\nA portion about ten feet square was being lifted bodily in front of\ntheir eyes, and before another word was said this block of the unknown\nsubstance was raised until they could see that it was all of a yard\nthick. Up it went at the same deliberate rate; and the four\ninvoluntarily moved closer together as they saw that there was something\nunderneath.\n\nIt was a cage, for all the world like that of an elevator except that it\nwas made of clear glass. Another second and it had stopped, with its\nfloor level with the surface; and the people from the earth saw that it\ncontained a man.\n\nHe was quite tall, slenderly built, and dressed in a queer satiny\nmaterial which fitted him like an acrobat's suit. He was extremely thin\nas to legs, narrow as to shoulders, deep in the chest and short in the\nwaist. All this, however, they saw after their inspection of his head.\n\nIt was human! Marvelously refined in every detail, yet it was set upon a\ngraceful neck, and modeled upon much the same lines as that of any man.\nIt was not that of a brute, nor yet that of a bird; it was--human!\n\nHe stood at ease, resting slightly on one foot, and dispelled any notion\nthat he might be unreal by shifting his weight occasionally. Meanwhile\nhe watched the four with a grave, interested smile; and they, in turn,\ncame closer.\n\nHis chin was small, even retreating; but his mouth was wide and curved\ninto an exaggerated Cupid's bow. Even as he continued to smile the\ncurves did not leave his lips; they, however, were thin rather than\nthick. His nose was quite small, with a decidedly Irish cast; but his\neyes, set far apart above quite shallow cheekbones, were exceedingly\nlarge and of a brilliant blue. In fact, it was mainly his eyes that gave\ncharacter to his face; although none could overlook his breadth of\nforehead, running back to a cranium that fairly bulged over the ears,\nand seemed ready to rise like a tightly inflated balloon. His skin was\npure white.\n\nAnd so they stood for uncounted minutes. At last the doctor noted that\nthe stranger was eying them with far less interest than they showed in\nhim; he stood as though he felt on display; and the doctor gave an\nexclamation of perplexity that broke the spell. The four impulsively\ndrew up to the glass; Van Emmon touched it with his mitten; and that is\nhow the four explorers came to receive the vibrations that came next.\n\nFor the man in the cage, in turn, put out his hand and touched the glass\nopposite Van Emmon. Then he opened his mouth.\n\n\"I am very glad to see you,\" said he in a soft, pulsating voice--and in\nthe best of English.\n\n\n\nIV\n\nA PUZZLED WORLD\n\nFor a moment blank amazement gripped the four. Then amazement gave way\nto genuine apprehension. Were they insane to imagine that this man of\nanother world had spoken to them in their own language? Each looked at\nthe other, and was astounded to see that all had heard the same thing.\n\nPresently the stranger spoke again; if anything, the kindly smile on his\nface became even broader. \"Suppose we postpone explaining how I am able\nto use your tongue. It will be easier for you to understand after you\nhave been with us a while.\" He spoke slowly and carefully, yet with a\nfaint lisp, much as some infant prodigy might speak.\n\nBut there was no doubt that he had really done it. The doctor managed to\nclear his throat.\n\n\"You are right,\" said he, with vastly less assurance than the amazing\nstranger. \"We will try to understand things in the order you think best\nto present them. You--should know best.\"\n\nKinney introduced himself by name and profession, also the other three.\nThe stranger nodded affably to each. \"You may call me Estra,\" said he,\npronouncing it \"Ethtra.\" \"There is no occupation on the Earth\ncorresponding with mine, but in my spare moments I am an astronomer like\nyourself.\"\n\nThe doctor silently marveled. He had not told the stranger about his\nhobby. Meanwhile the architect attempted to break the ice even finer.\n\n\"We take it for granted,\" said she rather nervously, \"that your people\nare somewhat further advanced than us on the earth. However, we expect\nto be given credit for having visited your planet before you visited\nours!\" She said this with an engaging smile which won an instant\nresponse; the Venusian's lips almost lost their curves in his generous\neffort.\n\n\"You will find that we greatly respect all that you have accomplished,\"\nhe declared earnestly. \"As for your apparatus\"--glancing at the cube--\n\"you have the advantage on the earth of certain chemical elements which\nare entirely lacking here, otherwise we should have called upon you long\nago.\"\n\nHe slipped a panel of glass to one side. \"Step in quickly!\" he\nexclaimed, gasping; and the four obeyed him without thought. It was only\nwhen the panel was replaced that they noticed the floor of the cage; it\nwas of clear glass, like the sides, and looked totally incapable of\nbearing their combined weight.\n\nThe Venusian smiled at Smith's worried look. \"The material is amply\nstrong enough,\" said he. \"I am only concerned about your machine there.\nIs it safe to be left alone?\"\n\n\"So far as we know, yes,\" answered Van Emmon, who did not feel quite as\nmuch confidence in the stranger as the rest.\n\n\"Then we can go down at once.\" With these words the man in satin turned\nto a small black box in one wall of the elevator and touched a button.\n[Footnote: For details of this and other matters of an electrical and\nmechanical nature, the technical reader is referred to Mr. Smith's\nreports to the A. S. M. E.]\n\nInstantly the car began to descend, at first slowly and then with\nswiftly increasing velocity. By the time the explorers had accustomed\ntheir eyes to the sudden semi-darkness, the cage was dropping at such a\nspeed that the air fairly sang past its sides.\n\nFar overhead was a square, black shadow in the waxlike crust which they\nhad left; it was the shadow of the cube. All about them was a dimly lit\nnetwork of braces, arches and semitransparent columns; to all\nappearances the system seemed to support the crust. Billie whirled upon\nthe Venusian:\n\n\"I've got it now! The whole globe is covered with glass!\"\n\nEstra smiled his approval. \"For thousands upon thousands of centuries,\nmy friend. The thing was done when our ancestors first suspected that\nour planet was doomed to come so near the sun. It was the only way we\ncould protect ourselves from the heat.\"\n\n\"Great!\" exploded the doctor, admiration overcoming regret that he had\nnot thought of it himself. But Smith had other thoughts:\n\n\"How long did it take to finish the job? And what did it cost?\"\n\n\"Two centuries; and about twice the cost of your last war. I need only\nsuggest to you that we colored the material so as to reflect most of the\nheat. That is why the material looks blue from below, although pink from\nabove.\"\n\n\"Say\"--from Billie--\"how long are we to keep on dropping like this?\"\n\n\"We will arrive in a moment or two,\" answered the smiling one. \"The roof\nis raised several miles above the sea-level in order to cover all the\nmountains.\"\n\nBy this time the four were able to make out things pretty well. They saw\nthat the dimness was only relative; the Venusian world was actually as\nwell lighted as any part of the earth on a cloudy day. And they saw that\nthey were descending in a locality of astonishing beauty.\n\nThe stranger halted the car so that they could inspect the scene as\nthough from an airplane. In no way did the landscape resemble that of\nthe earth. To begin with, pillars of huge dimensions were placed every\nquarter-mile or so; it was these that supported the intricate archwork\nabove. They were made of the same translucent stuff as the crust, but\nhad a light topaz tint. The Venusian said:\n\n\"You will not need to be told that the science of metallurgy has\nadvanced quite far with us. All our metals can be made transparent, if\nwe like; those pillars are colored variously in different regions so as\nto be clearly distinguishable and prevent collisions of flying\napparatus.\"\n\nBut Van Emmon and Billie were both more interested in what lay between\nthe columns. They scarcely noticed that there were no people in sight at\nthe time. The ground was covered with an indescribable wealth of color;\nand it was only by a close examination that the buildings could be\ndistinguished as such.\n\nFor they were all made of that semi-transparent stuff. Of every\nconceivable tint and shade, the structure showed an utter lack of\nuniformity in size, shape or arrangement. Moreover, the ground was\nabsolutely packed with them; they spread as far as the eye could reach.\n\nBut if there was profusion, there also was confusion--apparently.\nStreets ran anywhere and everywhere; there was no visible system to\nanything. And where there was no space for a building, invariably there\nwas a shrub, a bush or a small tree of some kind, all in full flower.\nThe only sign of regularity to be seen was in the roofs--practically all\nof them were flat. Whether the building was some rambling, loosely\ngathered agglomeration of vari-colored wings, or a single, towering\nskyscraper of one tint, almost inevitably it was crowned with a\nperfectly level surface.\n\n\"I see,\" said Van Emmon, thoughtfully. \"You have no rain.\"\n\n\"Precisely\"--from Estra. \"We have the air completely under our control.\nWe give our vegetation artificial showers when we think it should have\nit, not when nature wills; and similarly we use electricity instead of\nsunlight that we may stimulate its growth.\"\n\n\"In short\"--Van Emmon put it as the car slid slowly down the remaining\ndistance--\"in short, you have abolished the weather.\"\n\nThe Venusian nodded. \"And I'll save you the trouble of suggesting,\" he\nadded, \"that we are nothing more nor less than hothouse people!\"\n\n\n\nV\n\nTHE HUMAN CONSERVATORY\n\n\n\"But there is this difference,\" he cautioned as they stepped out of the\nelevator into a sort of a plaza, \"that, whereas you people on the earth\nhave only begun to use the hothouse principle, we here have perfected\nit.\n\n\"I suggest that you waste no time looking for faults.\"\n\nVan Emmon stared at the doctor. \"How does this idea fit your theory,\nKinney--that Venus is simply the earth plus several thousand extra\ngenerations of civilization?\"\n\n\"Fit?\" echoed the doctor. \"Fits like a glove. We humans are fast\nbecoming a race of indoor-people despite all the various \"back-to-\nnature\" movements. Look at the popularity of inclosed automobiles, for\nexample.\n\n\"The only thing that surprises me\"--turning to their guide--\"is that\nyou use your legs for their original purpose.\"\n\nEstra smiled, and pointed out something standing a few feet away. It was\na small, shuttle-shaped air-craft, with clear glass sides which had\nactually made them overlook it at first. Peering closer they saw that\nthe plaza and surrounding streets were nearly filled with these all but\ninvisible cars.\n\nThe Venusian explained. \"You marvel that I use my legs and walk the same\nas you do. I am glad you have brought up this point, because it is a\nfact that our people use mechanisms instead of bodily energy, almost\naltogether. These cars you see are universally used for transportation.\nI am one of the very few who appreciate the value of natural exercise.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say,\" demanded Van Emmon, \"that the average Venusian\ndoes no walking?\"\n\n\"Not a mile a year,\" said Estra gravely.\n\n\"Just what he is obliged to do indoors from room to room.\" And he\ninvoluntarily glanced down at his own extremely thin legs.\n\nThe architect's eyes widened with a growing understanding. \"I see now,\"\nshe murmured. \"That's why there was no one else to greet us.\"\n\nThe Venusian smiled gratefully. \"We thought it best. You'd have been\nshocked outright, I am sure, had you been introduced to a representative\nVenusian without any explanation.\"\n\nThey fell silent. Still, without moving from the point where they had\nleft the elevator, the four from the earth examined the surrounding\nbuildings in a renewed effort to see some system in their arrangement.\nDirectly in front of them was a particularly large structure. Like all\nthe rest, it was of hopelessly irregular design, yet it had a large\ndomed central portion which gave it the appearance of an auditorium; and\nthe effect was further borne out by a subdued humming sound which seemed\nto come from it.\n\nSmith asked Estra if it were a hall.\n\n\"Yes and no,\" was the answer. \"It fills the purpose of a hall, but is\nnot built on the hall plan.\" And Smith tried to stare through the\ntranslucent walls of the thing.\n\nThe other buildings within immediate reach were of every possible\nappearance. Some would have passed for cottages, others for stores,\nstill others for the most fanciful of studios. And nowhere was there\nsuch a thing as a sign, even at the street corners, much less on a\nbuilding.\n\n\"Not that we would be able to read your signs, if you had them,\"\ncommented the doctor, \"but I'd like to know how your people find their\nway without something of that kind to guide them.\"\n\nEstra's smile did not change. \"That is something you will understand\nbetter before long,\" said he, \"provided you feel ready to explore a\nlittle further.\"\n\nThe four looked at each other in question, and suddenly it struck them\nall that they were a rather pugnacious-looking crew in their cumbersome\nsuits of armor and formidable helmets. The doctor turned to Estra.\n\n\"You ought to know\"--he appealed--\"whether we can take off these suits\nnow.\"\n\n\"It would be best,\" was the reply. \"You will find the air and\ntemperature decidedly more warm and moist than what you have been used\nto, but otherwise practically the same. There is a slightly larger\nproportion of oxygen; that is all. Just imagine you are in a hothouse.\"\n\nSmith and the doctor were already discarding their suits. Van Emmon and\nBillie followed more slowly; the one, because he did not share the\ndoctor's confidence in their guide; the other, because of a sudden\nshyness in his presence. The Venusian noted this.\n\n\"You need not feel any embarrassment,\" said he to Billie's vast\nastonishment. \"There is no distinction here between the dress of the two\nsexes.\" And again all four marveled that he should know so much about\nthem.\n\nOnce out of the armor the visitors felt much more at ease. The slightly\nreduced gravitation gave them a sense of lightness and freedom which\nmore than balanced the junglelike oppressiveness of the air. They found\nthemselves guarding against a certain exuberance; perhaps it was the\nextra oxygen, too.\n\nThey strode toward the large structure directly ahead. At its entrance--\na wide, square portal which opened into a fan-shaped lobby--Estra paused\nand smiled apologetically--as he mopped his forehead and upper lip with\na paper handkerchief, which he immediately dropped into a small, trap-\ncovered opening in the wall at his side.\n\nThese little doors, by the way, were to be seen at frequent intervals\nwherever they went. Incidentally not a scrap of paper or other refuse\nwas to be noted anywhere--streets and all were spotless.\n\nAs for Estra--\"I am not accustomed to moving at such speed,\" he\nexplained his discomfort. \"If you do not mind, please walk a little more\nleisurely.\"\n\nThey took their time about passing through this lobby. For one thing,\nEstra said there would have to be a small delay; and for another, the\nwalls and ceilings of the space were most remarkably ornamented. They\nwere fairly covered with what appeared, at first glance, to be\nabsolutely lifelike paintings and sculptures. They were so arranged as\nto strengthen the structural lines of the place, and, of course, they\nwere of more interest to Billie than to the others. [Footnote: The\nspecialist in architecture and related subjects is referred to E.\nWilliams Jackson's report to the A.I.A., for details of these basrelief\nphotographs.]\n\nDesiring to examine some of the work far overhead, Billie clambered up\non a convenient pedestal in order to look more closely. She took the\nstrength of things for granted, and put her weight too heavily on a\nmolding on the edge of the pedestal; with the result that there was a\nsharp crack; and the girl struck the floor in a heap. She got to her\nfeet before Van Emmon could reach her side, but her face was white with\npain.\n\n\"Sprained--ankle,\" said she between set lips, and proceeded to stump up\nand down the lobby, \"to limber up,\" as she said, although her three\ncompanions offered to do anything that might relieve her.\n\nTo the surprise of all, Estra leaned against a pillar and watched the\nwhole affair with perfect composure. He made no offer of help, said\nnothing whatever in sympathy. In a moment he noticed the looks they gave\nhim--their stares.\n\n\"I must beg your pardon,\" he said, still smiling. \"I am sorry this\nhappened; it will not be easy to explain.\n\n\"But you will find all Venusians very unsympathetic. Not that we are\nhard hearted, but because we simply lost the power of sympathy.\n\n\"We do not know what pity is. We have eliminated everything that is\ndisagreeable, all that is painful, from our lives to such an extent that\nthere is never any cause for pity.\"\n\nThe three young people could say nothing in answer. The doctor, however,\nspoke thoughtfully:\n\n\"Perhaps it is superfluous; but--tell me--have you done away with\ninjustice, Estra?\"\n\n\"That is just the point,\" agreed the Venusian. \"Justice took the place\nof pity and mercy; it was so long ago I am barely able to appreciate\nyour own views on the subject.\"\n\nBillie, her ankle somewhat better, turned to examine other work; but at\nthe moment another Venusian approached from the upper end of the lobby.\nWalking slowly, he carried four small parcels with a great deal of\neffort, and the explorers had time to scrutinize him closely.\n\nHe was built much like Estra, but shorter, and with a little more flesh\nabout the torso. His forehead bulged directly over his eyes, instead of\nabove his ears, as did Estra's; also his eyes were smaller and not as\nfar apart. His whole expression was equally kind and affable, despite a\ncuriously shriveled appearance of his lips; they made the front of his\nmouth quite flat, and served to take attention away from his pitifully\nthin legs.\n\nEstra greeted him with a cheery phrase, in a language decidedly\ndifferent from any the explorers were familiar with. In a way, it was\nSpanish, or, rather, the pure Castilian tongue; but it seemed to be\ndevoid of dental consonants. It was very agreeable to listen to.\n\nEstra, however, had taken the four parcels from his comrade, and now\npresented him to the four, saying that his name was Kalara, and that he\nwas a machinist. \"He cannot use your tongue,\" said the Venusian. \"Few of\nus have mastered it. There are difficulties.\n\n\"As for these machines\"--unwrapping the parcels--\"I must apologize in\nadvance for certain defects in their design. I invented them under\npressure, so to speak, having to perfect the whole idea in the rather\nshort time that has elapsed since you, doctor, began the sky-car.\"\n\n\"And what is the purpose of the machines?\" from Billie, as she was about\nto accept the first of the devices from the Venusian.\n\nFor some reason he appeared to be especially interested in the girl, and\naddressed half of his remarks to her; and it was while his smiling gaze\nwas fixed upon her eyes that he gave the answer:\n\n\"They are to serve\"--very carefully--\"partly as lexicons and partly as\ngrammars. In short, they are mechanical interpreters.\"\n\n\n\nVI\n\nTHE TRANSLATING MACHINES\n\n\n\"First, let me remind you,\" said the Venusian, \"of our lack of certain\nelements that you are familiar with on the Earth. We have never been\nable to improve on the common telephone. That is why we must still\nassemble in person whenever we have any collective activity; while on\nthe Earth the time will come when your wireless principle will be\ndeveloped to the point of transmitting both light and sound; and after\nthat there will be little need of gatherings of any sort.\"\n\nThen he explained the apparatus. It consisted of a miniature head-\ntelephone, connected to a small, metallic case the size of a cigar-box,\nthe cover of which was a transparent diaphragm. Estra did not open the\ncase, but showed the mechanism through the cover.\n\n\"Essentially, this is a 'word-for-word' device,\" said he, pointing to a\nswiftly revolving dial within the box. \"On one face of that dial are\nsome ten thousand word-images, made by vibration, after the phonograph\nmethod. Directly opposite, on the other face, are the corresponding\nwords in the other language. The disk is rotating at such an enormous\nspeed that, for all practical purposes, any word which may chance to be\nspoken will be translated almost instantaneously.\"\n\nHe indicated two delicate, many-tentacled \"feelers,\" as he called them,\none on each face of the disk. One of these \"felt\" the proper word-image\nas it whirled beneath, while the other established an electrical contact\nwith the corresponding waves beneath, at the same time exciting a\ncomplicated-looking talking machine.\n\n\"That,\" commented Estra, \"is not so easy to explain. It transforms this\nliteral translation into an idiomatic one. Perhaps you will understand\nits workings a little later when you learn how and why I am able to use\nyour own language.\"\n\nBy this time the four had reached the point where nothing could surprise\nthem. They were becoming accustomed to the unaccustomed. Had they been\ntold that the Venusians had abolished speech altogether, they would have\nfelt disappointed, but not incredulous. However, the doctor thought of\nsomething.\n\n\"Have you any extra 'records,' to be used in case we visit some other\nnations while we are here?\"\n\nFor just a second the Venusian was puzzled; then his smile broadened.\n\"The one record will do,\" said he, \"wherever you go.\"\n\n\"A universal language!\" Billie's eyes sparkled with interest.\n\n\"Long, long ago,\" Estra said. \"It was established soon after our league\nof nations was formed.\"\n\n\"Does the league actually prevent war and promote peace?\" demanded Van\nEmmon. This had been a disputed question when the four left the earth.\n\n\"We no longer have a league of nations,\" said their guide slowly. And\ninstantly the four were eying him eagerly. This was really refreshing,\nto find that the Venusians were actually lacking in something.\n\n\"So it didn't work?\" commented the doctor, disappointed.\n\nBut the Venusian's smile was still there. \"It worked itself out,\" said\nhe. \"We have no further use for a league. We have no more nations. We\nare now--one.\"\n\nAnd he helped them adjust the machines.\n\nThe cases were slung over their shoulders and the telephones clamped to\ntheir ears. When all ready, Estra began to talk, and his voice came\nnearly as sharp and clear through the apparatus as before. It was\nmodified by a metallic flatness, together with a certain amount of\nmechanical noise in which a peculiar hissing was the most noticeable.\nOtherwise he said:\n\n\"I am now using my own language. If I make any mistakes, you must not\nblame the machine. It is as nearly perfect as I was able to make it.\"\n\nHe then asked them what blunders they noted. Billie, who was the most\nenthusiastic about the thing, declared that they would have no trouble\nin understanding; whereupon Estra quietly asked:\n\n\"Do you feel like going now to try them out?\"\n\nOnce more an exchange of glances between the four from the earth.\nClearly the Venusians were extremely considerate people, to leave their\nvisitors in the care of the one man, apparently, who was able to make\nthem feel at home. There seemed to be no reason for uneasiness.\n\nBut Van Emmon still had his old misgivings about Estra. There was\nsomething about the effeminate Venusian which irritated the big\ngeologist; it always does make a strong man suspicious to see a weaker\none show such self-confidence. Van Emmon drew the doctor and Billie\naside, while Smith and Estra went on with the test. Said Van Emmon:\n\n\"It just occurred to me that the cube might look pretty good to these\npeople. You remember what this chap said about their lack of some of our\nchemicals. What do you think--is it really safe to put ourselves\nentirely in their power?\"\n\n\"You mean,\" said the doctor slowly, \"that they might try to keep us here\nrather than lose the cube?\"\n\nVan Emmon nodded gravely, but Billie had strong objections. \"Estra\ndoesn't look like that sort,\" she declared vehemently.\n\n\"He's too good natured to be a crook; he needs a guardian rather than a\nwarden.\"\n\nIt flashed into the doctor's mind that many a woman had fallen in love\nwith a man merely because he seemed to be in need of some one to take\ncare of him.\n\nThat is, the self-reliant kind of woman; and Billie certainly was self-\nreliant. Something of the same notion came vaguely to the geologist at\nthe same time; and with a vigor that was quite uncalled for, he urged:\n\n\"I say, 'safety first.' We shouldn't have left the cube unguarded. I\npropose that one of us, at least, return to the surface while the others\nattend this meeting--or trap, for all we know.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Billie promptly. \"Get Estra to show you how to use the\nelevator, and wait for us in the vestibule.\"\n\nVan Emmon's face flamed. \"That isn't what I meant!\" hotly. \"If anybody\ngoes to the cube, it should be you, Billie!\"\n\nIf Billie did not notice the use of her nickname, at least the doctor\ndid. The girl simply snorted.\n\n\"If you think for one second that I'm going to back out just because I'm\na woman, let me tell you that you're very badly mistaken!\"\n\nVan Emmon turned to the doctor appealingly, but the doctor took the\naction personally. He shook his head. \"I wouldn't miss this for\nanything, Van. Estra looks safe to me. Go and ask Smith; maybe he is\nwilling to be the goat.\"\n\nThe geologist took one good look at the engineer's absorbed,\nunquestioning manner as he listened to the Venusian, and gave up the\nidea with a sigh. For a moment he was sour; then he smiled shyly.\n\n\"I'm more than anxious to meet the bunch myself,\" he admitted; and led\nthe way back to Estra. The Venusian looked at him with no change of\nexpression, although there was something very disconcerting in the\nprecocious wisdom of his eyes. Their very kindliness and serenity gave\nhim an appearance of superiority, such as only aggravated the\ngeologist's suspicions.\n\nBut there was nothing to do but to trust him. They followed him through\ntwo sets of doors, which slid noiselessly open before them in response\nto some mechanism operated by the Venusian's steps. This brought them to\nanother of the glass elevators, in which they descended perhaps ten\nfeet, stepping out of it onto a moving platform; this, in turn, extended\nthe length of a low dimly lighted passageway about a hundred yards long.\nWhen they got off, they were standing in a small anteroom.\n\nThe Venusian paused and smiled at the four again. \"Do you feel like\ngoing on display now?\" he asked; then added: \"I should have said: 'Do\nyou feel like seeing Venus on display, for we all know more or less\nabout you already.'\"\n\nBut the visitors were braced for the experience. Estra looked at each\napprovingly, and then did something which made them wonder. He stood\nstock still for perhaps a second, his eyes closed as though listening;\nand then, without explanation, he led the way through an opal-glass door\ninto a brilliantly lighted space.\n\nNext moment the explorers were standing in the midst of the people of\nVenus.\n\n\n\nVII\n\nTHE ULTIMATE RACE\n\n\nThe four were at the bottom of a huge, conelike pit, such as instantly\nreminded the doctor of a medical clinic. The space where they stood was,\nperhaps, twenty feet in diameter, while the walls enclosing the whole\nhall were many hundreds of feet apart. And sloping up from the center,\non all sides, was tier upon tier of the most extraordinary seats in all\ncreation.\n\nFor each and every one of those thousands of Venusians was separately\nenclosed in glass. Nowhere was there a figure to be seen who was not\ninstalled in one of those small, transparent boxes, just large enough\nfor a single person. Moreover--and it came somewhat as a shock to the\nfour when they noted it--the central platform itself was both covered\nand surrounded with the same material.\n\n\"Make yourselves at home,\" Estra was saying. He pointed to several\nmicrophones within easy reach. \"These are provided with my translators,\nso when you are ready to open up conversation, go right ahead as though\nyou were among your own people.\" And he made himself comfortable in a\nsaddlelike chair, as much as to say that there was no hurry.\n\nFor a long time the explorers stood taking it in. The Venusians, without\nexception, stared back at them with nearly equal curiosity. And despite\nthe extraordinary nature of the proceeding, this mutual scrutiny took\nplace in comparative silence; for while the glass gave a certain sense\nof security to the newcomers, it also cut off all sound except that low\nhumming.\n\nThe nearest row of the people got their closest attention. Without\nexception, they had the same general build as Estra; slim, delicate, and\nanemic, they resembled a \"ward full of convalescent consumptives,\" as\nthe doctor commented under his breath. Not one of them would ever give a\njoke-smith material for a fat-man anecdote; at the same time there was\nnothing feverish, nervous, or broken down in their appearance. \"A pretty\nlot of invalids,\" as Billie added to the doctor's remark.\n\nMany observers would have been struck, first, by the extreme diversity\nin the matter of dress. All wore skin-tight clothing, and much of it was\nsilky, like Estra's. But there was a bewildering assortment of colors,\nand the most extraordinary decorations, or, rather, ornaments. So far as\ndress went, there was no telling anything whatever about sex.\n\n\"Are they all men?\" asked Billie, wondering, of Estra. The Venusian\nshook his head with his invariable smile. \"Nor all women either,\" said\nhe enigmatically.\n\nBut in many respects they were astonishingly alike. Almost to a soul\ntheir upper lips were withered and flat. One and all had short,\nemaciated-looking legs. Each and every one had a crop of really\nluxuriant hair; the shades varied between the usual blonde and brunette,\nwith little of the reddishness so common on the earth; but there were no\nbald people at all. On the other hand, there were no beards or mustaches\nin the whole crowd; every face was bare!\n\n\"Like a lot of Chinamen,\" said Van Emmon in an undertone; \"can't tell\none from another.\" But Billie pointed out that this was not strictly\ntrue; a close inspection of the faces showed an extremely wide range of\ndistinction. No two chins in the crowd were exactly alike, although not\none of them showed any of the resolute firmness which is admired on the\nEarth. All were weak, yet different.\n\nNeither were there any prominent noses, although there were none that\ncould have been called insignificant. And while every pair of eyes in\nthe place was large, as large as Estra's, yet there was every desirable\ncolor and expression.\n\nTo sum it all up, and to use the doctor's words: \"They've developed a\nstandard type, all right, just as the characteristic American face is\nthe standard Earth type; but--did you ever see such variations?\"\n\nNevertheless, the most striking thing about these people to the eyes of\nthe visitors was their mutual resemblance. For one thing, there seemed\nto be no nervous people present. There were many children in the crowd,\ntoo; yet all sat very still, and only an occasional movement of the\nhands served to indicate consciousness. In this sense, they were all\nremarkably well bred.\n\nIn another, they were remarkably rude. At any given moment a good half\nof the people were eating, or, rather, sipping liquids of various sorts\nfrom small tumblers. Probably every person in the house, before the\naffair was over, had imbibed two or three ounces of fluid; but not once\nwas the matter apologized for, nor the four invited to partake.\n\n\"So this may be the outcome of our outrageous habit of eating sweetmeats\nat theaters,\" muttered the doctor. And again noting the hairless faces:\n\"Just what I said when men first began using those depilatories instead\nof shaving--no more beards!\"\n\nBut it was Billie who explained the invariable crop of hair. \"No use to\nlook for baldness; they don't wear hats! Why should they, since there's\nneither sun nor rain to protect their heads from?\"\n\nMainly, however, the architect was interested in the building itself. To\nher, the most striking feature was not the tremendously arched dome, nor\nyet the remarkable system of bracing which dispensed with any columns in\nall that vast space. It was something simpler--there were no aisles.\n\n\"Now, what do you make of that?\" the girl asked Van Emmon. \"How do they\never get to their places?\" But he could not suggest anything more than\nto recall an individual elevator scheme once proposed.\n\nTo Smith, one object of interest was the telephone system. Remarkably\nlike those used on the Earth, one was located in each of the tiny glass\ncages. He was likewise puzzled to account for the ventilation system;\neach cage was apparently air-tight, yet no Venusian showed any\ndiscomfort.\n\nBut the geologist, for want of anything strictly within his professional\nrange, interested himself in trying to fathom the moral attitude of\nthese people. He was still suspicious of them, notwithstanding a growing\ntendency to like every one of their pleasant, really agreeable faces.\nThere was neither solemnity, sourness, nor bitterness to be seen\nanywhere; at the same time, there was no sign of levity. In every\ncountenance was the same inexplicable mixture of wisdom and benevolence\nthat distinguished Estra. Nowhere was there hostility, and nowhere was\nthere crudity. Somehow, the big geologist would have felt more at home\nhad he seen something antagonistic. Essentially, Van Emmon was a\nfighter.\n\nAt last the four felt their attention lagging. Novelties always pall\nquickly, no matter how striking. Estra sensed the feeling and inquired:\n\n\"Which of you will do the honors?\"\n\nInstinctively the three younger folk turned to the doctor. He made no\nprotest, but stepped at once to one of the microphones, put on his most\nimpressive professional face, and began:\n\n\"My friends\"--and Van Emmon noted a pleased look come into every face\nabout them--\"my friends, I do not need to state how significant this\nmeeting is to us all. From what Estra has said, I gather that you have\ninformed yourselves regarding us, in some manner which he has promised\nto make clear. At all events, I am exceedingly anxious to see your\nastronomical apparatus.\"\n\nAt this a broad smile came to many of the faces before him; but he went\non, unnoticing: \"Certainly there is not much I could tell you which you\ndo not already know; Estra's use of our language proves this. I only\nneed to assure you that we will be glad to answer any questions that may\noccur to you. It goes without saying that we, of course, are filled with\ndelight to find your planet so wondrously and happily populated,\nespecially after our experience on Mercury, of which, I presume, you are\ninformed.\"\n\nApparently they were. The doctor went on: \"You may be sure that we are\nfairly bursting with questions. However, we are content to become\ninformed as Estra sees fit to guide us.\n\n\"There is just one thing, more than any other, which I would like to\nknow at this time. Why is it that, although you all show a great lack of\nexercise, and are continually eating, you never appear to be healthy?\"\n\nInstantly a Venusian in the fifth row, to the doctor's right, touched\nhis phone and replied: \"It is a matter of diet. We have nothing but\n'absolute' foods; if you understand what that means.\"\n\nAnd from that time on, despite the fact that the explorers asked\nquestions which, at home, would have found hundreds ready and able to\nanswer, on Venus only one person answered any given question, and always\nwithout any apparent prearrangement. For a long time they could not\naccount for this.\n\nThe doctor motioned for Smith to take his place. The engineer looked a\nlittle embarrassed, but cleared his throat noisily and said:\n\n\"I am especially struck with the fact that each of you sits in a\nseparate glass pew, or case. Why is this?\"\n\nThe reply came from one of the few people present who showed any signs\nof age. He was, perhaps, sixty, and his hair was fast whitening. He\nsaid:\n\n\"For reasons of sanitation. It is not wise to breathe the breath of\nanother.\"\n\n\"Also,\" supplemented someone from the other side of that vast pit--\n\"also, each is thereby enabled to surround himself with the electrical\ninfluences which suit him best.\"\n\nSmith stepped back, pondering. The doctor looked to the geologist to\ntake his place, but Van Emmon made way for Billie. At any other time she\nwould have resented his \"woman-first\" attitude; now she quickly found\nvoice.\n\n\"How are you able to get along without aisles? It may seem a foolish\nquestion, to you; but on earth we would consider a hall without aisles\nabout as convenient as a room without a door.\"\n\nImmediately a Venusian directly in front of her, and on a level with her\neyes, called out: \"Watch me, madam.\" And quite without an effort beyond\ntouching a button or two, the fellow rose straight into the air, glass\nand all, and then floated gently over toward the middle of the hall.\n\n\"It probably appears complicated to you,\" explained the Venusian whose\nside he had just left. \"We make use of elements not found on your\nearth.\"\n\nBillie's sang froid was not shaken. Instantly she came back\nenergetically: \"Apparently your method overcomes gravitation. Why\nhaven't you tried to travel away from your planet?\"\n\nAnd she looked around with the air of one who has uttered a poser, only\nto have another of the satin-clad people reply, from a point which she\nwas not able to locate:\n\n\"Because enough such power cannot be safely concentrated.\"\n\nAs Billie retired, Van Emmon noted with growing irritation that the\ncontinuously affable aspect of the Venusians had not altered in any way,\nunless it was to become even more genial and sure. The big man strode\nenergetically to the microphone, and the other three noted a general\nmovement of interest and admiration as the people inspected him.\n\n\"Why,\" demanded he, \"do we see no signs of contention? If you are\nfamiliar with conditions on the earth, you surely know that rivalry, in\none form or another, is the accepted basis of life. But all of you,\nhere, appear to be perfectly happy, and at the same time entirely sure\nof yourselves.\n\n\"We have just come from a planet where we have seen the principle of\ncombat, of competition, carried so far that it seems to have wrecked the\nrace; so you will pardon my curiosity, I am sure. From your faces, one\nwould conclude that you had abolished self-interest altogether. Just why\nare you so--well, extraordinarily self-complacent?\" And he thrust out\nhis aggressive jaw as though to make up for the lack of chins about him.\n\n\"Because there is nothing for us to combat, save within ourselves.\" This\nfrom a wide-faced chap in a bluish-white suit.\n\n\"But surely you have rivalry of some sort?\"\n\n\"No.\" Another voice added: \"Rivalry is the outgrowth of getting a\nlivelihood; on earth it is inevitable, because men do the work. Here,\neverything is done by machines.\" Still another put in: \"Discontent is\nthe mother of ambition, but we are all content, because each possesses\nall he desires.\"\n\nBut the geologist was far from satisfied. \"Then,\" said he vigorously,\n\"if you have eliminated all contention, you have nullified the great law\nof contrasts. You say you are all rich. How do you know, if you have no\npoverty to contrast it with?\n\n\"On earth, we appreciate warmth because we have experienced cold;\npleasure, because we know pain; happiness, because we have always had\nmisery with us. If we have not had the one, we cannot value the other.\n\n\"If you have never been discontented, how do you know that you are\ncontent?\"\n\n\n\nVIII\n\nTHE KEY-NOTE\n\n\nFor a minute or two it looked as though Van Emmon had raised an\nunanswerable question. There was no immediate reply. Even Estra looked\naround, as though in wonder at the silence, and seemed on the point of\nanswering of his own accord when a voice came from a man far up on the\nleft. He said:\n\n\"A little explanation may be wise. To begin with, you will agree that\nblack is black because white is white; but it doesn't follow that blue\nis blue because green is green, or red is red. Blue is blue because it\nis neither green nor red nor any other color. It is blue, not because it\ncontrasts with these other colors, but because it merely differs from\nthem.\n\n\"Now, we on Venus do not need poverty, in order to appreciate wealth.\nInstead, each of us is blessed with his own particular choice of wealth.\nEach is blessed in a different way; some with children, some with\nintellect, some with other matters; and the question of mere quantity\nnever enters.\"\n\n\"We do not need pain or misery,\" spoke up someone else, \"any more than\nyou people on the earth require an additional color, in order to\nappreciate the variety you already have.\" And then, from a Venusian with\nan especially strong voice:\n\n\"That we are really content, we know absolutely. For each of us, in his\nown distinctive way, is wholly and peculiarly satisfied.\"\n\nAnd it only added to the geologist's irritation to have these striking\nstatements made in a good-humored, impersonal fashion which totally\ndisarmed all opposition. That the Venusians were perfectly sure of their\nground, was undeniable; but they had such a cheerful way of looking at\nit, as though they didn't care a rap whether Van Emmon agreed or not,\nthat--If they'd only have shown some spirit! Van Emmon would have liked\nit infinitely better if one of them had only become hot about it.\n\nAt this point Estra rose in his chair. \"I think you had best approach us\nfrom a fresh viewpoint,\" said he in his unfailingly agreeable manner.\nThe doctor nodded vigorously, and again Estra closed his eyes in that\nodd, hesitating way. Immediately every one in the place, with the\nexception of a single person in the lowest row, took flight in his or\nher little glass pew. In a moment the great vault overhead was fairly\nswarming with people; and in less than a minute the last of them had\nfloated out through one of the arches in the walls.\n\nEstra opened a panel in the central cage, and admitted the Venusian who\nhad stayed behind. She--for it appeared to be a young woman--walked with\nabout the same facility as Estra; but as soon as she had entered the\nspace, took the seat Estra had vacated, and waited.\n\nThe action rather disappointed the doctor. He removed the interpreting\ntelephone from his head, and asked:\n\n\"I rather thought we were going to meet one of your officials, Estra.\nWe'd hate to go back home without having met your president, or whatever\nyou call your chief executive.\"\n\nThe two Venusians exchanged smiles, and to the surprise of the explorers\nthe woman gave the reply, in language as good as Estra's, but an even\nsweeter expression: \"There is no such thing as a chief executive on\nVenus, friends.\"\n\n\"I meant,\" explained the doctor, rattled, \"the chairman of your cabinet,\nor council, or whatever it is that regulates your affairs. Perhaps,\"\nwith an inspiration, \"I should have said, the speaker of your congress.\"\n\nThe Venusian shook her head, still smiling. She hesitated while\nselecting the best words; and the four noted that, while her features\nwere quite as delicate as Estra's, her face was proportionately larger,\nand her whole figure better filled out. No one would have said that she\nwas pretty, much less beautiful; but none would deny that she was very\ngood-looking, in a wholesome, intelligent, capable sort of a way. Her\nname, Estra told them later, was Myrin; and he explained that he and she\nwere associated solely because of their mutual interest in the same\nplanet--the Earth.\n\nSaid Myrin: \"You are accustomed to the idea of government. We, however,\nhave outgrown it.\n\n\"If you stop to think, you will agree that the purpose of government is\nto maintain peace, on the one hand, and to wage war, on the other. Now,\nas to war--we haven't even separate nations, any more. So we have no\nwars. And as for internal conflict--why should we ever quarrel, when\neach of us is assured all that he can possibly want?\"\n\n\"So you have abolished government?\"\n\n\"A very long time ago. You on the earth will do the same, as soon as\nyour people have been educated up to the point of trusting each other.\"\n\n\"You haven't even a congress, then?\"\n\nMyrin shook her head. \"All questions such as a congress would deal with,\nwere settled ages ago. You must remember that the material features of\nour civilization have not changed for thousands of generations. The only\nquestions that come up now are purely personal ones, which each must\nsettle for himself.\"\n\nVan Emmon, as before, was not at all satisfied. \"You say that machinery\ndoes your work for you. I presume you do not mean that literally; there\nmust be some duties which cannot be performed without human direction,\nat least. How do you get these duties accomplished, if you have no\ngovernment to compel your people to do them?\"\n\nMyrin looked at a loss, either for the answer itself or for the most\nsuitable words. Estra gave the reply: \"Every device we possess is\nabsolutely automatic. There is not one item in the materials we use but\nthat was constructed, exactly as you see it now, many thousands of years\nago.\"\n\nSmith was incredulous. \"Do you mean to say that those little glass pews\nhave been in use all that time?\"\n\nEstra nodded, smiling gently at the engineer's amazement. \"Like\neverything else, they were built to last. You must remember that we do\nnot have anything like an 'investment,' here; we do not have to consider\nthe question of 'getting our capital back.' So, if any further\nimprovements were to be made, they also would be done in a permanent\nfashion.\"\n\nBillie gave an exclamation of bewilderment. \"I don't understand! You say\nthat nothing new has been built, or even replaced, for centuries. How do\nyou take care of your increase in population?\" thinking of the great\ncrowd that had just left.\n\nMyrin was the one who answered this. As she did so, she got slowly to\nher feet; and speaking with the utmost care, watched to be sure that the\nfour understood her:\n\n\"Ever since the roof was put on, our increase of population has been\nexactly balanced by our death rate!\"\n\nThe four followed their guides in silence as they led the way into the\nplaza. Now, the space was alive with Venusians. The little cages were\neverywhere floating about in the air; some of the people were\nlaboriously shifting themselves into their aircraft; others were guiding\ntheir \"pews\" direct to nearby houses. The visitors got plenty of curious\nstares from these quiet miracle-workers, who seemed vastly more at home\nin the air than on the ground. \"As thick as flies,\" Van Emmon commented.\n\nEstra and Myrin, walking very slowly, took them to a side street, where\ntwo of the cigar-shaped cars were standing. Billie and Smith got in with\nEstra, while Van Emmon and the doctor were given seats beside the\nVenusian woman. The two cars were connected by telephone, so that in\neffect the two parties were one.\n\nBy this time, the visitors had become so accustomed to the transparent\nmaterial that they felt no uneasiness as the ground receded below them.\nSmith, especially, was tremendously impressed with Estra's declaration\nthat the glass was, except for appearance, nothing more nor less than an\nextremely strong, steel alloy.\n\nPropelled by the unexplained forces which the two drivers controlled by\nmeans of buttons in black cases, the two cars began to thread their way\nthrough the great roof-columns; and as they proceeded, the four grew\nmore and more amazed at the great extent of the city. For miles upon\nmiles that heterogeneous collection of buildings stretched, unbroken and\nwithout system, until the eye tired of trying to make out the limits of\nit.\n\n\"What is the name of this city?\" asked Billie, secretly hoping that it\nmight bear some resemblance to \"New York.\" It struck her fancy to assume\nthat this supermetropolis represented what Gotham, in time, might\nbecome.\n\nEstra did not take his attention from what he was doing, but answered as\nreadily as ever. \"I do not blame you for mistaking this for a city. The\nfact is, however, that we have no such thing.\"\n\nBillie stared at him helplessly. \"You've abolished cities, too?\"\n\n\"Not exactly. In the same sense that we have abolished nations, yes.\nLikewise we have abolished states, also counties. Neither have we such a\nthing as 'the country,' now.\n\n\"My friends, Venus is simply one immense city.\"\n\n\n\nIX\n\nTHE SURVIVAL OF ALL\n\n\nSomehow all four were unwilling to press this question. It did not seem\npossible that Estra was right, or, if he was, that they could possibly\nunderstand his explanation, should he give it. The cars flew side by\nside for perhaps a hundred miles, while the visitors put in the time in\nexamining the landscape with the never-ending interest of all aeronauts.\n\nHere and there, in that closely-packed surface, a particularly large\nbuilding was to be noted every half mile or so. \"Factories?\" asked\nBillie of Estra, but he shook his head.\n\n\"I'll show you factories later on,\" said he. \"What you see are schools.\"\nBut most observers would have considered the structures severely plain\nfor their purpose.\n\nAfter a long silence: \"I'm still looking for streams,\" said Van Emmon to\nMyrin. \"Are your rivers as large as ours?\"\n\n\"We have no rivers,\" was the calm reply. \"Rivers are entirely too\nwasteful of water. All our drainage is carried off through underground\ncanals.\"\n\n\"You haven't done away with your oceans, too, have you?\" the geologist\nasked, rather sarcastically. But he was scarcely prepared for the reply\nhe got.\n\n\"No; we couldn't get along without them, I am afraid. However, we did\nthe best we could in their case.\" And without signaling to Estra she\ndove the machine towards the ground. Smith looked for the telephone\nwires to snap, but Estra seemed to know, and instantly followed Myrin's\nlead. The doctor noticed, and wondered all the more.\n\nAnd then came another surprise. As the machines neared the surface, a\nfamiliar odor floated in through the open windows of the air-craft; and\nthe four found themselves looking at each other for signs of\nirrationality. A moment, and they saw that they were not mistaken.\n\nFor, although that kaleidoscopic expanse of buildings showed not the\nslightest break, yet they were now located on the sea. The houses were\npacked as closely together as anywhere; apparently all were floating,\nyet not ten square yards of open sea could be seen in any one spot.\n\nVan Emmon almost forgot his resentment in his growing wonder. \"That gets\nme, Myrin! Those houses seem to be merely floating, yet I see no motion\nwhatever! Why are there no waves?\"\n\nThe doctor snorted. \"Shame on you, Van! Don't let our friends think that\nyou're an absolute ignoramus.\" He added: \"Venus has no moon, and no\nwind, at least under the roof. Therefore, no waves.\"\n\nSmith put in: \"That being the case, there is no chance to start a wave-\nmotor industry here. Neither,\" as he thought further, \"neither for\nwater-power. Having no rain in your mountains, Estra, where do you get\nyour power?\"\n\nBut it was Myrin who answered. \"I suppose you are all familiar with\nradium? It is nothing more or less than condensed sunlight, which in\nturn is simply electromagnetic waves; although it may take your\nscientists a good many centuries to reach that conclusion.\n\n\"Well, every particle of the material which composes this planet,\ncontains radioactivity of some sort; and we long ago discovered a way to\nrelease it and use it. One pound of solid granite yields enough energy\nto--well, a great deal of power.\"\n\nThey had now been flying for two hours, and still no end to that\nthickly-housed, ever different appearance of the ground. Also, although\nthey saw a great many birds, they noted no animals. Finally, Billie\ncould hold in no longer.\n\n\"Are we to understand,\" she demanded of Estra, \"that the whole of this\nplanet is as densely populated as we see it?\"\n\n\"Just that,\" replied the Venusian. \"Why not? The roof makes our climate\nuniform from pole to pole, while our buildings are such that, whether on\nland or on sea, they are equally livable.\"\n\n\"But--Estra!\" expostulated the girl. \"Venus is nearly as big as the\nearth. And it looks to be as thickly populated as--as Rhode Island! Why,\nyou must have a colossal population; let me see.\" And she scribbled away\nin her memorandum book.\n\nBut both Smith and the doctor had already worked it out. They looked up,\nblinking dazedly.\n\n\"Over three hundred billion,\" murmured the doctor, as though dizzy.\n\nThe Venusian checked Smith's correction with, \"You dropped one cipher,\ndoctor. There are three and a half trillion of us!\"\n\n\"Good lord!\" whispered Van Emmon, all his antagonism gone for the\nmoment. And again the explorers were silent for a long time.\n\nBy and by, however--\"We have just seen what it meant, there on Mercury,\"\nsaid the doctor, in a low voice, \"for the principle of 'the survival of\nthe fit' to be carried to its logical end; for who is to decide what is\nfitness, save the fittest? One man, apparently, outlived every one else\non the planet, and then he also died.\n\n\"But here you have gone the limit in the other direction. Of course, we\nmight have known that you long ago abolished poverty, unearned wealth,\npestilence, drunkenness and the other causes of premature death; but as\nfor three and a half trillion!\"\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" remarked Myrin, \"every last one of us, once born, lives\nto die of old age; and in most cases this means several hundred of your\nyears.\"\n\nSmith involuntarily rubbed his eyes; and they all laughed, a nervous\nsort of a laugh which left the visitors still in doubt as to their\nsenses, and their guides' sanity. Van Emmon's suspicions came back with\na rush, and he burst out:\n\n\"Say--you'll excuse me, but I can't swallow this! Here you've shown us\nhouses as thick as leaves; not a sign of a farm, much less an orchard!\nNo vegetation at all, except for a few flowers!\n\n\"Three and a half trillion! All right; let it go at that!\" Out came his\nchin, and he brought one fist down upon the other as though he were\ncracking rocks with a hammer, and with every blow he uttered a word:\n\n\"How--do--you--feed--them--all?\"\n\n\n\nX\n\nLOAVES AND FISHES\n\n\nWithout a word Myrin drove her machine toward the ground, and, as\nbefore, Estra followed despite the lack of any visible signal. Within a\nminute the two machines had come to rest, softly and without\ndisturbance, on the roof of a handsome building, much like an apartment\nhouse. There was the usual transparent elevator, and a minute later the\nfour were being introduced to the occupants of a typical Venusian house.\n\nThese two people, apparently man and wife, did not need to be told why\nthe explorers had been brought there. They led the way from the dimly\nlighted hallway in which the elevator had stopped, into a group of\nbrightly decorated rooms. Here the four were given seats in the usual\nsaddellike chairs, and then Myrin answered Van Emmon's question:\n\n\"I knew that this point would arise soon, and you will pardon me if I\nhandle it in a prearranged fashion. I will admit that it is not an easy\nquestion Mr. Van Emmon has put; not because the answer is at all\ncomplicated but, on the contrary, extremely simple.\"\n\nThe four were listening unanimously. Despite himself, Van Emmon was\nhighly impressed by the Venusian woman's serious manner. Perhaps it was\nbecause, in her earnestness, she was not quite so affable as before. She\nwent on:\n\n\"From where you are sitting, you can see all the rooms in this house.\nYou will look in vain for anything even remotely resembling a kitchen.\nThere is not even a dining-room.\n\n\"And yet you must not jump to the conclusion that we all use\nrestaurants. We have no such thing as a public eating place. Or rather,\"\nand here she spoke very carefully, \"rather, every place is an eating\nplace.\"\n\nThe doctor looked Myrin over as though she were a patient with a new\nkind of disease. \"You do not mean that literally, of course,\" said he\nkindly.\n\nBut she nodded gravely. \"You must not misunderstand. Remember, even on\nyour own planet, the distribution of food is becoming more and more\nextensive, until you can now buy something to eat at every crossroads.\nWe have merely carried the idea to its logical end, so that all\nVenusians can obtain food at any time, and at any spot.\"\n\nShe turned in her chair--all the chairs on Venus were pivoted, Estra\nsaid--and touched a button in the wall at her hand. A panel slid\nnoiselessly aside, and revealed a tiny buffet. At least, Billie labeled\nit a buffet, for want of a more accurate term.\n\nFor it consisted of a silver bibb, something like the nozzle of a soda-\nwater fountain above which was a board containing a large number of\ntiny, numbered push buttons. Below the bibb was a space in which a cup\nmight be set, and projecting from a tube at one side was a solid block\nof telescoping, transparent cups.\n\n\"This,\" said Myrin, \"is the Venusian Nutrition System. There is a\nstation like this in every room on the planet.\" And she proceeded to\ntake a cup from the tube, filling each from the silver faucet while she\npressed a variety of the buttons.\n\nThe four watched in silence, and eagerly took what was given to them. It\ncomprised liquids entirely; liquids of every degree of fluidity, from\nsome as thin as water to others as thick as gruel. They varied even more\nas to color, ranging from actual transparency to a deep chocolate.\n\n\"Now, I warn you not to be shocked,\" said Myrin, \"although I fully\nexpect that you will be. The fact is that we have no other kind of food\nthan what you see; there are thousands upon thousands of different kinds\nand flavors, but they are all fluids. We have nothing whatever in solid\nform.\n\n\"You see,\" she explained, \"we have no teeth.\"\n\nAll they could do was to stare at her as, with a return of her smile,\nshe made a sudden gesture across the front of her mouth. Next instant a\nset of false teeth lay in her hand!\n\nEstra spoke up. \"We are both obliged to wear them in order that we might\nuse your language.\" He removed his own, to show a mouth as free of teeth\nas a newborn baby's. Both Venusians replaced their sets, and smiled\nafresh at the explorers' astonishment.\n\n\"Teeth will soon be a thing of the past with you on the Earth, too,\"\ncommented Myrin. \"Dr. Kinney will surely testify to that. Your use of\nsoft, cooked foods, instead of the coarse, hard articles provided by\nnature, is bound to have this effect in time. With us, it resulted in\nhaving teeth reduced to the standing of your appendix; and, like you, we\nresort to an operation rather than take chances on trouble. I may\nmention that the appendix is totally absent from all Venusians, while we\nare beginning to lose all traces of either the first or second molars;\njust as you are beginning to lose your wisdom teeth.\n\n\"However, suppose you try our diet while I explain.\"\n\nThe four once more looked at each other. The doctor was the first to\ntake a sip of one of the cups handed to him, and Van Emmon was the last;\nthe geologist waited to see the effects upon the others before gingerly\ntasting of the thickest, darkest liquid of them all. Another taste, and\nhe discovered that it was very good, and that he was exceedingly hungry.\n\n\"Very delicately flavored,\" commented Billie, after emptying her fourth\nglass, a golden fluid with a slightly oily appearance.\n\n\"Delicately is right,\" said the doctor. \"This stuff is barely flavored\nat all, Estra.\"\n\nThe Venusian was also \"eating.\" \"We much prefer them all that way,\" said\nhe. \"I suppose you would consider our tastes very finicky, on Earth; but\nthe fact is we are able to distinguish between minute variations in\nflavoring such as would escape all on earth except a humming-bird.\"\n\n\"I suppose,\" remarked the doctor, smacking his lips over a reddish\nsolution with a winelike flavor, \"I suppose we can expect something of\nthat sort on the Earth, too, in time. Originally mankind was only able\nto distinguish fresh from stale, and animal from vegetable flavors.\"\n\nAfter a while Myrin went on: \"You know, the processes of nutrition, as\nthey take place among your people, are extremely wasteful. You have\nprobably heard it said that 'the average human is only fifty per cent\nefficient.' That simply means that digestion, assimilation and excretion\nrequire half the energy which they secure from the food.\n\n\"Now, the articles you have just swallowed require very little work on\nthe part of your digestive apparatus, and none at all upon your\neliminating tract. The food is almost instantly transformed into fresh\nblood; if I am not mistaken, you already feel much refreshed.\"\n\nThis was decidedly true. All four felt actually stimulated; Van Emmon\ninstantly suspected the food of being alcoholic. As he continued to\nwatch its effect, however, he saw that there was no harmful reaction as\nin the case of the notorious drug.\n\n\"I think I can now tell you how we produce enough food for the three and\na half trillion of us, despite our lack of farms and orchards,\" said\nMyrin rising.\n\nReturning to the air-craft, the four were taken a short distance in a\nnew direction, and again descended, this time transferring to an\nelevator which dropped far below the surface. They came to a stop about\nten floors down.\n\n\"Naturally,\" said Myrin, \"we reserve all the surface for residence\npurposes; although, it is possible to live down here in comparative\ncomfort, since we have plenty of electrical energy to spare.\" And she\noperated a switch, flooding the place with a brilliant glow. Thrown from\nconcealed sources, this light was quite as strong as the subdued\ndaylight which they had just left. \"But unless we were free to fly about\nas much as we do, we should feel that life was a bore. Nobody stays\nbelow any longer than is necessary.\n\n\"Now, this is where our food comes from.\" Whereupon she showed them a\nseries of automatic machines, all working away there in the solid rock\nof the planet; and of such an extraordinary nature that Smith, the\nengineer, moved about in an atmosphere of supreme bliss.\n\n\"You will understand,\" said Myrin, \"that the usual processes of\nnutrition, on the Earth, depend entirely upon plant life. We, however,\ncannot spare room enough for any such system; so we had to devise\nsubstitutes for plants.\n\n\"In effect, that is what these machines are. They convert bed-rock into\nloam, take the nitrates and other chemicals [Footnote: The geology of\nVenus is thoroughly described in Mr. Van Emmon's reports to the A. M. E.\nA.] directly from this artificial soil, and by a pseudo-osmotic process\nsecure results similar to those produced by roots.\n\n\"Likewise we have developed artificial leaves,\" pointing out a huge\napparatus which none but a highly trained expert in both botany and\nmechanics could half understood. \"This machine first manufactures\nchlorophyl--yes, it does,\" as the doctor snorted incredulously; \"not an\nimitation, but real chlorophyl--and then transforms the various elements\ninto starch, sugar, and proteids through the agency of the sunlight\nrecovered from the granite.\n\n\"In short, to answer your question, Mr. Van Emmon, as to how we are all\nfed--we do not grow our food at all; we go straight to the practically\nunlimited supply of raw materials under our feet, and manufacture our\nfood, outright!\"\n\n\n\nXI\n\nTHE SUPER-AMBITION\n\n\nBillie was very quiet during their return to the surface. She said\nnothing until they had reached the two cars; and then pausing as she was\nabout to step in, she said:\n\n\"Well, I never saw our old friend, the high cost of living, handled\nquite so easily!\n\n\"If that's the way you do things here, Estra,\" and the girl did not\nflinch at the gazes the others turned upon her, \"if that's your way,\nit's good enough for me! I'm going to stay!\"\n\nFor the first time, Estra looked astonished. He and Myrin exchanged\nlightninglike glances; then the Venusian's face warmed with the smile he\ngave the architect.\n\n\"It is very good of you to say that,\" he said impressively. \"I was\nafraid some of our--peculiarities--might arouse very different\nfeelings.\"\n\nThey stared at one another for a second or two, long enough for the\ndoctor to notice, and to see how Van Emmon took it. The geologist,\nhowever, was smiling upon the girl in a big-brotherly fashion, which\nindicated that he thought she didn't mean what she had said. Had he been\nlooking up at her, however, instead of down upon her, he would have seen\nthat her chin was most resolute.\n\nJust as they were about to start again, both Estra and Myrin stopped\nshort in their tracks, with that odd hesitation that had mystified the\nfour all along; and after perhaps five seconds of silence turned to one\nanother with grave faces. It was Estra who explained.\n\n\"It is curious how things do pile up,\" said he, a little conscious of\nhaving employed an idiom. \"Our planet has gone along for hundreds of\ngenerations without anything especially remarkable happening, so that\nrecently many prophets have foretold a number of startling events to\ntake place on a single day. And this seems to have come true.\n\n\"You have been with us scarcely ten hours,\" and the visitors stared at\neach other in amazement that so much time had passed; \"scarcely ten\nhours, and here comes an announcement which, for over a hundred years,\nhas been looked forward to with--\"\n\nHe stopped abruptly. The doctor gently took him up: \"'Looked forward to\nwith'--what, Estra?\"\n\nEstra and Myrin considered this for perhaps three seconds. It was the\nwoman who replied: \"The fact is, your approach to the planet has\nstimulated all sorts of research immensely. Matters that had been\nhanging fire indefinitely were revived; this is one of them. In that\nsense, you are to blame.\" But she smiled as reassuringly as she could,\nallowing for a certain anxiety which had now come to her face.\n\n\"Don't you think you could make it clear to us?\" asked Billie\nencouragingly. At the same time all four noted that the air, which\nbefore had fairly thronged with machines, was now simply alive with\nthem. People were flitting here and there like swarms of insects, and\nwith as little apparent aim. Both Estra and Myrin were extra watchful;\nalso, they displayed a certain eagerness to get away, setting their\ncourse in still another direction. In a minute or two the congestion\nseemed relieved, and Myrin began to talk slowly:\n\n\"You have doubtless guessed, by this time, that we Venusians have\ncrossed what some call 'the animal divide.' We are predominatly\nintellectual, while you on the earth are, as a race, still predominantly\nanimal. Excuse me for putting it so bluntly.\"\n\n\"It's all right,\" said the doctor, with an effort. \"What you say is\ntrue--of most of us.\" He added: \"Most thinking people realize that when\nour civilization reaches the point where the getting of a living becomes\nsecondary, instead of primary as at present, a great change is bound to\ncome to the race.\"\n\nThe Venusian nodded. \"Under the conditions which now surround us, you\ncan see, we have vastly more time for what you would call spiritual\nmatters. Only, we label them psychological experiences.\n\n\"In fact, the 'supernatural' is the Venusian's daily business!\"\n\nThere was another pause, during which both Venusians, driving at high\nspeed though they were, once more closed their eyes for a second or so.\nEstra evidently thought it time to explain.\n\n\"For instance, 'telepathy.' With us it takes the place of wireless; for\nwe have developed the power to such a point that any Venusian can 'call\nup' any other, no matter where either may be. That is why we need no\nsigns or addresses. There are certain restrictions; for instance, no one\ncan read another's thoughts without his permission. Of course, we still\nhave speech; speech and language are the ABC's of the Venusian; and we\nstill keep the telephone, for the sake of checking up now and then. Just\nnow, we are driving for my own house, where there is apparatus which\nwill enable you to both hear and understand an announcement which is\nshortly to be made.\"\n\nThere was something decidedly satisfying, especially to Van Emmon, in\nbeing taken into the Venusian confidence to this extent. When he put his\nquestion, it was with his former aggressiveness much modified. He said:\n\n\"I should think that your people have pretty well exhausted the\npossibilities of the supernatural, by this time. Progress having come to\nan end, I don't see what you find to interest you, Myrin.\"\n\n\"The fact is,\" Billie put in, \"we feel somewhat disappointed that your\npeople have shown so little interest in us.\" And she gave a sidelong\nglance at Estra, who returned the look with a direct, smiling gaze which\nsent a flood of color into the architect's face.\n\n\"Look out!\" sharply, from Van Emmon; and with barely an inch to spare,\nEstra steered his car past another which he had nearly overlooked. For\nanother minute or two there was silence; then Myrin said:\n\n\"You wonder what there is to interest us. And yet, every time you look\nup at the stars, the answer is before your eyes.\n\n\"You see, although we cannot read your thoughts without your permission,\nyet you on the earth cannot prevent us from 'overhearing' anything that\nmay be said. Under proper conditions, our psychic senses are delicate\nenough to feel the slightest whisper on the earth.\n\n\"That is why Estra and I are able to use your language; we have learned\nit together with an understanding of your lives and customs, by simply\n'listening in.' I may add that we are also able to use your eyes; we\nknew, directly, what you people looked like before you arrived.\n\n\"Well, it is our ambition to visit, in spirit, every planet in the\nuniverse!\n\n\"There are hundreds of millions of stars; every one is a sun; and each\nhas planets. One in a hundred contains life; some very elementary,\nothers much more advanced than we are.\n\n\"So far, we have been able to study nearly two thousand worlds besides\nthose in this solar system. Do you still think, friend, we have nothing\nto interest us?\"\n\nShe raised a hand in a gesture of emphasis; and it was then that Billie,\nher eyes on Myrin's fingers, saw another sign of the great advancement\nthese people had made--direct proof, in fact, of what Myrin had just\nclaimed.\n\nFor there must have been a tremendous gain in the intellect to have\ncaused such a drain upon the body as Billie saw. In no other way could\nit be explained; the minds of the Venusians had grown at a fearful cost\nto flesh and blood.\n\nNot only were the fingernails entirely lacking from Myrin's hand, but\nthe lower joints of her four fingers, from the palm to the knuckles were\ngrown smoothly together.\n\n\n\nXII\n\nTHE MENTAL LIMIT\n\n\n\"Make yourselves at home,\" said Estra, as they stepped into his\napartment. The cars just filled his balcony. \"This is my 'workshop'; see\nif you can guess my occupation, from what you see. As for Myrin and\nmyself, we must make certain preparations before the announcement is\nmade.\"\n\nThey disappeared, and the four inspected the place. As in the other\nhouse they had entered, the room was provided with a double row of small\nwindows; some being down near the floor and the others level with the\neyes. These, in addition to two doors, all of which were of translucent\nmaterial.\n\nOn low benches about the room were a number of instruments, some of\nwhich looked familiar to the doctor. He said he had seen something much\nlike them in psychology class, during his college days. For the most\npart, their appearance defied ordinary description. [Footnote:\nPhysicians, biologists, and others interested in matters of this nature\nwill find the above fully treated in Dr. Kinney's reports to the A. M.\nA.]\n\nBut one piece of apparatus was given such prominence that it is worth\ndetailing. It consisted of a hollow, cube-shaped metal framework; about\na foot in either direction, upon which was mounted about forty long\nthumb-screws, all pointing toward the inside of the frame. The inner\nends of the screws were provided with small silver pads; while the outer\nends were so connected, each with a tiny dial, as to register the amount\nof motion of the screw. Smith turned one of them in and out, and said it\nreminded him of a micrometer gage.\n\nThen Billie noted that the entire device was so placed upon the bench as\nto set directly over a hole, about ten inches in diameter. And under the\nbench was one of the saddlelike chairs. The architect's antiquarian lore\ncame back to her with a rush, and she remembered something she had seen\nin a museum--a relic of the inquisition.\n\n\"Good Heavens!\" she whispered. \"What is this--an instrument of torture?\"\n\nIt certainly looked mightily like one of the head-crushing devices\nBillie had seen. Thumb-screws and all, this appeared to be only a very\nelaborate \"persuader,\" for use upon those who must be made to talk.\n\nBut the doctor was thinking hard. A big light flashed into his eyes.\n\"This,\" he declared, positively, \"is something that will become a matter\nof course in our own educational system, as soon as the science of\nphrenology is better understood.\" And next second he had ducked under\nthe bench, and thrust his head through the round hole, so that his skull\nwas brought into contact with some of those padded thumb-screws.\n\n\"Get the idea?\" he finished. \"It's a cranium-meter!\"\n\nIt did not take Smith long to reach the next conclusion. \"Then,\" said\nhe, \"our friend Estra is connected with their school system. Can't say\nwhat he would be called, but I should say his function is to measure the\ncapacity of students for various kinds of knowledge, in order that their\neducation may be adapted accordingly.\n\n\"Might call him a brain-surveyor,\" he concluded.\n\n\"Or a noodle-smith,\" added the geologist, deprecatingly.\n\n\"Rather, a career-appraiser!\" indignantly, from Billie. \"People look to\nhim to suggest what they should take up, and what they should leave\nalone. Why, he's one of the most important men on this whole planet!\"\n\nAnd again the doctor was a witness to a clash of eyes between the girl\nand the geologist. Van Emmon said nothing further, however, but turned\nto examine an immense book-case on the other side of the room.\n\nThis case had shelves scarcely two inches apart, and about half as deep,\nand held perhaps half a million extremely small books. Each comprised\nmany hundreds of pages, made of a perfectly opaque, bluish-white\nmaterial of such incredible thinness that ordinary India-paper resembled\ncardboard by comparison.\n\nThey were printed much the same as any other book, except that the\ncharacters were of microscopic size, and the lines extremely close\ntogether. Also, in some of the books these lines were black and red,\nalternating.\n\nBillie eagerly examined one of the diminutive volumes under a strong\nglass, and pronounced the black-printed characters not unlike ancient\nGothic type. She guessed that the language was synthetic, like Roman or\nEsperanto, and that the alphabet numbered sixty or seventy.\n\n\"The red lines,\" she added, not so confidently, \"are in a different\nlanguage. Looks wonderfully like Persian.\" By this time the others were\ndoing the same as she, and marveling to note that, wherever the red and\nblack lines were employed, invariably the black were in the same\nlanguage; while the red characters were totally different in each book.\n\nSuddenly Smith gave a start, so vigorously that the other turned in\nalarm. He was holding one of the books as though it were white hot.\n\"Look!\" he stuttered excitedly. \"Just look at it!\"\n\nAnd no wonder. In the book he had chanced to pick up, the red lines were\nprinted in ENGLISH.\n\n\"Talk about your finds!\" exclaimed Billie, in an awe-struck tone. \"Why,\nthis library is a literal translation of the languages of--\" she fairly\ngasped as she recalled Myrin's words--\"thousands of planets!\"\n\nAfter that she fell silent. Plainly the discovery had profoundly\naffected and strengthened her notion of remaining on the planet. Van\nEmmon, watching her narrowly, saw her give the room an appraising glance\nwhich meant, plain as day, \"I'd like to keep this place in spick and\nspan condition!\" And another, not so easy to interpret: \"I'd like to\nshow these people a thing or two about designing houses!\" And the\ngeologist's heart sank for an instant.\n\nHe turned resolutely to the bookcase, and shortly found something which\nhe showed to the doctor. It was a book printed all in \"Venusian.\" They\ncarefully translated the title-page, using one of the interlinear\nEnglish books as a guide; and saw that it was a complete text-book on\nastral development.\n\n\"With these instructions,\" the doctor declared, \"any one could do as the\nVenusians do--visit other worlds in spirit!\"\n\nJust then Estra and Myrin returned. They were moving at what was, for\nthem, a rapid pace; and to all appearances they were rather excited.\n\n\"We were not able to make these records as perfect as we would like,\"\nsaid Estra, holding up four disks similar to the ones which still lay in\nthe explorers' translating machines. He proceeded to open the little\nblack cases and make the exchange. \"There will be words used which I did\nnot see fit to incorporate in the original vocabulary, but which you\nwill have to understand perfectly if this announcement is to mean\nanything to you.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said the doctor quietly. \"And now, don't you think we had\nbest know in advance, just what is to be the subject of--\"\n\n\"Hush!\" whispered Estra; and next second they were listening to the\ntelephone in amazement.\n\n\n\nXIII\n\nTHE WAR OF THE SEXES\n\n\n\"In accordance with my promise,\" stated a high-pitched effeminate voice,\n\"I am going to demonstrate a juvenation method upon which I have worked\nfor the past one hundred and twenty-two years.\"\n\nThere was a brief pause, during which Estra hurriedly explained that the\nman who was making the speech was located far on the other side of the\nplanet, in a hall like the one the four had first visited; and that he\nwas making the demonstration before a great gathering of scientists.\n\"Too bad you cannot see as we do,\" commented the Venusian. \"However,\nSavarona may go into the details of--\"\n\n\"If the committeemen are entirely finished with their measurements,\"\nstated the unseen experimenter, \"I would like to have the results\ncompared with the recorded figures of Pario Camenol, who was born on the\ntwo hundred and fifteenth day of the year twenty-one thousand seven\nhundred and four.\"\n\nAnother rest, and Estra said: \"They are examining a boy who appears to\nbe about twelve years of age.\"\n\nThen came other voices: \"As we all know, the craniums of us all are\nabsolutely distinct; as much so as our finger-prints.\" \"The measurements\ncorrespond identically with those of Pario Camenol, beyond a doubt.\"\n\"This boy can be none other than Pario.\"\n\n\"Then,\" the high-pitched voice went on, \"then notice the formula I have\nwritten on this blackboard. Using this solution, I have supplied\nnourishment to this lad from the hour of his birth. Until a few days\nago, I was not satisfied with the results; the patient showed a tiny\nvariation from the allowable subconscious maximum, together with only\nnine-tenths the required motor reaction.\n\n\"But I have corrected this. Briefly, I have incorporated in Pario\nCamenol's standard diet certain elements which have hitherto been unsafe\nto combine. These elements are derivatives of the potash group, for the\nmost part, together with phosphates which need a new classification.\nTheir effect,\" impressively, \"has been to postpone age indefinitely!\"\n\nThere must have been a tremendous sensation in that hall. The speaker's\nvoice shook with excitement as he went on:\n\n\"We have sought in vain, friends, for a way to cheat death of his due.\nWe have succeeded in postponing his advent until our average longevity\nis several times greater than on our neighboring planet. But so far, it\nhas been a mere reprieve.\n\n\"What I have done is to prevent age itself. This lad is a hundred and\ntwenty-two years old, mentally, and still only twelve years old, as to\nbody!\n\n\"In short, I offer you the fountain of youth itself!\"\n\nThe speaker paused. There was no comment. Evidently all had been as\ngreatly impressed as the explorers. Then the voice of the man Savarona\nfinished, very deliberately:\n\n\"I regret to say that my treatment, despite all that I have been able to\ndo, cannot be adapted to the female constitution. It would be fatal to\nany but males. I repeat--I can offer eternal youth, absolutely, but only\nto new-born males!\"\n\nThis time there was a definite response. From the telephone came a\nconfused murmuring, at which Van Emmon's face lighted up with delight.\nThe murmuring had an angry sound!\n\n\"This is outrageous!\" a loud contralto voice was raised above the rest.\n\"You are unethical, Savarona, to announce such a thing before adapting\nit to both sexes!\"\n\nThe high-pitched voice replied shortly, and with more than a hint of\nmalice: \"If a woman had discovered this, instead of me, I dare say you\nwould have no objections!\"\n\nThe murmuring grew louder, angrier, more confused. The four from the\nearth looked at each other in some slight uneasiness. At the same time\nthey noted that Estra, his eyes tightly closed and his fists clenched in\nthe intensity of his concentration, suddenly gave a sigh of relief. Next\nsecond he began to speak into the telephone, in a voice so loud as to\nsilence all the clamor.\n\n\"Savarona, and the people of Venus! Listen!\n\n\"The prophets were right when they said today would witness many great\nthings! I have just learned of another experiment which transcends even\nthat of Savarona!\"\n\nAn instant's pause; then: \"First let me remind you that we have been\ndoing all we could to elevate our spiritual selves. We are daily trying\nto eliminate all that is animal, all that is gross and bemeaning in us,\neven to the extent of reducing the flavors of our foods to the lowest\ntolerable point. And despite all this, we have not been able to get rid\nof sex jealousy!\n\n\"We still have the beast within us! No matter how pure our love may be,\nit is always tainted with rivalry! Always the husband and wife are held\ndown by this mutual envy, forever dragging at their heels, constantly\nholding them back from the lofty heights of spiritual power to which\nthey aspire!\"\n\nHe paused, and Savarona's voice broke in, triumphantly: \"You are right,\nEstra! You are right, except you did not mention that this jealousy\nbecomes less and less as one grows older!\n\n\"Now, my discovery will put an end to your beast, Estra! My experiments\ntook this lad before he had become a man, and allowed his brain to\ndevelop, while his body stopped growing! He is a man in mentality, and\nan innocent boy in body!\n\n\"Estra, I have done the thing you wish! This boy will never know\njealousy, because he will never know love!\"\n\nThe man in the room with the four answered in a flash: \"So you have,\nSavarona, but only for MEN! No female can benefit by what you have\ndone!\"\n\n\"But I tell you that, within the past few minutes, a child has been born\nunder circumstances which can be repeated at any time, and for any sex!\"\n\n\"In this case,\" the Venusian's voice changed curiously; \"in this case,\nhowever, it was a girl; for the mother controlled the sex in the\ncustomary manner.\" At this, the doctor's interest became acute. At the\nsame time, the other three felt a tremendous, inexplicable thrill.\n\n\"Friends\"--and Extra's face shone in his enthusiasm--\"friends, for the\nfirst time in creation the human male germ has been dispensed with! The\nintellect has done what the laboratory could not do!\n\n\"I have the honor to announce that my sister, Amra, has just given\nbirth\"--his voice fairly rang--\"has just given birth to a girl baby,\nwhose only father was her mother's brain!\"\n\n\n\nXIV\n\nESTRA\n\n\nThis time there was no drowning the confusion. The telephone fairly\nshook with innumerable cries, shouts, imprecations. The four gave up\ntrying to hear, and watched the two Venusians.\n\nMyrin was facing Estra now. Her expression had lost a great deal of its\ngood humor, and there was a certain sharpness in her voice as she\nexclaimed:\n\n\"Estra--if your sister has done this, and I see no reason to doubt it,\nthen she has made man superfluous! If women can produce children\nmechanically, and govern the sex at will, the coming race need be\nnothing but females!\"\n\nEstra nodded gravely. \"That is what it amounts to, Myrin!\"\n\nFor a moment the two stared at one another challengingly. On the earth,\ntheir attitude would have indicated some unimportant tiff. None would\nhave dreamed that the most momentous question in their lives had come\nup, and had found them at outs.\n\nNext instant Myrin turned, and without another word walked from the\nroom. Estra followed slowly to the door, where he stood looking after\nher with an expression of the keenest concern on his sensitive, high-\nstrung features. The three men from the earth, after a glance,\nstudiously avoided looking at him; but Billie walked up and laid a hand\non his arm.\n\n\"Are you really in favor of this--scheme?\" she inquired, in a curiously\ntender voice. At the same time she gazed intently into Estra's eyes.\n\nHe turned, and the smile came back to his face. He took Billie's hand\nand laid it between both his own. His voice was even gentler than\nbefore.\n\n\"Most certainly I do favor my sister's method, Billie. It will be the\ngreatest boon the race has ever known. We can look forward, now\"--and\nhis face shone again--\"can look forward to generation upon generation of\npeople whose spirituality will be absolute!\"\n\nThe girl moved closer to him. She spoke with feverish earnestness.\n\n\"There may be some hitch in the idea, Estra. If God meant for man to\nbecome--to become obsolete, He would not have hidden the method all this\ntime. Suppose some flaw should develop--later on?\"\n\nIn the cube, Billie Jackson would not have stumbled over such a speech.\nShe would have ignored the fact that Estra was holding her hand all this\ntime, and gazing deep into her eyes; she would have been filled with\nwhat she was saying and not with what she was seeing. On the other side\nof the room, Van Emmon watched and glowered; he could not hear.\n\nThe Venusian lifted his head suddenly. The voices from the telephone had\nsubsided; only an occasional outburst came from the instrument. Estra\nclosed his eyes again for a second, and when he opened them again, his\nmanner was astonishingly alert, and his speech swift and to the point.\n\n\"So far as we know, Billie, the method has no flaws. It gives us the\nchance to throw off our lower selves; and if by so doing, we reduce the\nrace to a single sex, only--\"\n\nHe stopped short, as though at a sound; and with a word of apology\nstepped from the room. He opened another door, far down the corridor;\nand as he passed through, the wail of a new-born infant came faintly to\nthe four.\n\n\"Wonder what's up?\" said Smith. Van Emmon, who had gone to the window,\nwhirled upon the engineer and motioned him to his side.\n\n\"Look at the people!\"\n\nSmith saw that the nearby houses were almost concealed by a throng which\nhad gathered, silently and without confusion, during the past few\nminutes. Their numbers were increasing swiftly, fresh arrivals packing\nthe background. People filled the streets; the space below Estra's\nbalcony was already crowded as closely as it could be. Except for a low-\nvoiced buzzing, there was no disturbance.\n\nBillie came up. She seemed to divine the temper of the mob. She caught\nher breath sharply, and then said, very simply:\n\n\"It reminds me of--Bethlehem.\"\n\nBut the words had scarcely left her mouth before an uproar sounded from\none end of the street below. A crowd of excited Venusians was pushing\nits way determinedly toward the house, their passage obstructed by\nshouting, protesting individuals. Van Emmon's breast began to heave; he\nfancied he saw blows struck.\n\n\"By George!\" he exclaimed, next second. \"They're fighting!\"\n\nIt was true; a hand-to-hand battle was going on less than a block away.\nThe people below the window surged in the direction of the fight; all\nwere shouting, now; the clamor was deafening.\n\n\"Live and let live!\" came one of the shouts. It was taken up by the\ngroup that was doing the attacking, and made into a cheer. Then came\nother cries from them. Smith made out something like \"Down with sex\nmonopoly!\"\n\n\"Don't you see?\" shouted Smith, above the din. \"These people below are\nEstra's friends; those newcomers are backing Savarona! Get the idea?\" he\nrepeated. \"If Estra wins out, the old boy with the fountain of youth\nwill never get another boy baby to experiment on!\"\n\n\"What!\" The doctor leaped to their sides. He took it in at a glance;\nthen whirled to the door. \"We ought to warn Estra!\"\n\n\"He knows it already!\" reminded Billie swiftly. A great shout came from\nbelow; the attackers had forced their way through the crowd of Estra's\nfriends.\n\n\"Well!\" Van Emmon stood squarely in the middle of the room. \"So far as\nI'm concerned, Estra and his sister can face that crowd alone! I don't\napprove of the scheme!\"\n\nThe doctor eyed him thoughtfully. \"I'm not so sure, Van. This is a\ntremendous thing; we ought to--\"\n\n\"Van is--right!\" exploded Billie. Her voice rose to a shriek as a crash\nshook the house.\n\nNext instant Myrin, for once in a hurry, broke into the room. She\nglanced about, missed Estra, looked slightly puzzled, and then frowned\nangrily as the Venusian himself stepped in: \"You fooled me!\" she shot at\nhim. But he smiled apologetically. He was carrying a large package of\nleaflets, closely printed in Venusian; there seemed to be several\nthousand in the lot. He said, by way of explanation:\n\n\"I had to get ready. Savarona's people will be here any moment; they\nhave destroyed the elevator, and--\"\n\nA wave of clamor burst from below. \"They've broken the barrier,\"\nremarked Estra calmly; he turned to the door, then whirled at a crash\nwhich sounded from above. \"Through the roof,\" he added. He did not even\nglance at the balcony, where the two cars barred the way against any\nattack from that direction.\n\nNext second he again quit the room. Myrin hesitated a moment,\nirresolute, and then followed him thoughtfully. They never saw her\nagain. As for Estra, he came back in a moment carrying a small, white\nbundle, which stirred in his arms. He unhesitatingly handed the child to\nBillie. His mouth moved soundlessly as a muffled shriek arose from the\nother end of the corridor; there was a thud, a metallic crash, and a\ngreat roar of voices. The mob had broken in, and up, through the back of\nthe house. The first of the attackers thrust his head and shoulders into\nsight not ten feet away.\n\nEstra touched something with his foot, and a door shot across the\ncorridor. There was an instant's silence; then, the thunder of the mob,\nhurling itself against the door. The people were fairly snarling now.\nEstra closed the inner door.\n\n\"Estra!\" shrilly, from Billie. She laid the baby down, and strode to the\nVenusian. \"Let's get out of here! The car's on the balcony; nobody's in\nthe way to interfere! Why not--\"\n\nA grinding, ripping jar from above, and Estra shook his head. The smile\nwas gone, and his mouth was set and grim. \"They'd catch us before we\nwent a mile,\" he said, glancing at the infant, who had begun to cry, in\na stifled, gasping way that tore at the nerves.\n\n\"Estra!\" Billie pleaded; but he turned away. The doctor strode up to him\nand gripped his shoulder.\n\n\"What's the good, Estra? What can you accomplish even if you--\"\n\nThe Venusian tapped his forehead. \"I can TELL!\" he exclaimed, with a\nreturn of that exalted flush. \"Just give me a chance to offer my\nsister's discovery to the world, and I shall be satisfied!\" He touched\nthe package of leaflets. \"These are not written as clearly as they\nshould be; but if I cannot hold them back, then these\"--fingering the\npapers--\"these go to the friends down below!\" He moved closer to the\nwindow, but his eyes were on the door.\n\nA rending crash told that the corridor was now open to the mob. There\nwas a rush, and then the storm of the people battering the last door.\n\n\"Van! Doc! Billie!\" Smith had the window open, and was stepping into one\nof the cars. Kinney and the geologist were at his side in an instant.\nThe girl held back.\n\n\"Estra!\" she begged. She picked up the baby, and with her free hand\ntugged at the Venusian's arm. \"Come on! Don't sacrifice yourself!\"\n\nThe door bulged under the attack. The noise was ear-splitting.\nNevertheless Estra heard, and shook his head without looking at the\nwoman from the Earth. She dashed to the window, then came back. \"Hurry!\nThere's a chance!\" He stood unmoved, watchful and ready. \"Estra! I want\nyou to come!\" Her face flamed. \"Can't you see? Can't you see that I--I\nwant you?\" She gasped as the door shrieked under the strain. \"Come--if\nyou're a man!\"\n\nThe Venusian's face changed. He turned, and stared at the girl with eyes\nthat held nothing but blank amazement. The grimness left his mouth, his\nlips partly opened. He took a step forward and threw an arm about her\nshoulders.\n\n\"Billie--I'm sorry! I never thought!\" A crack showed at the edge of the\ndoor, and a roar smote their ears. Estra backed to the window. \"Go!\" he\nshouted. \"Go quickly, while you can!\"\n\nBillie stood stock still, gazing at him. \"I'm going to stay!\" she\nscreamed. \"I'll take my chances with--\"\n\nHe thrust her through the window. \"You don't understand!\" he shouted,\nand took the baby away from her, despite all her strength. Then a\nwonderfully tender light came into his eyes. He gripped Billie's hands,\nand spoke sorrowfully:\n\n\"Billie--I'm not what you thought! I'm not a man--I'm a woman!\"\n\n\n\nXV\n\nBACK!\n\n\nBy the time Smith had driven the strange craft fifty yards, he had it\nunder control. Billie glanced back; Estra was out on the balcony, now,\nand the mob was surging against the windows she had locked against them.\nShe shifted the baby to the hollow of one arm while with the other she\nbroke the cord of the packet.\n\nAt the sight, the crowd in the street gave voice. \"Let us have it!\" they\nwere crying; they drowned out the uproar within the house. Estra did not\neven look at the other car.\n\nThen the windows gave way. Like the breaking of a dam, a flood of\nVenusians poured and tumbled at Estra's feet. She raised her hand, and\nshouted something Billie could not hear; then, scarcely without pause,\nthe crowd bore down upon her.\n\nAnd even as she was crushed against the railing, with one hand she\ndropped the baby to eager, upstretched arms below; and with the other\nshe tossed the package high in the air. There it broke apart, the air\ncaught it, and the thousands of leaflets fluttered down upon that street\nfull of sympathizers.\n\nLeaflets, each of which described a discovery which was to give to women\nthe power of abolishing the opposite sex, of making Venus a world not\nonly one in country, one in industry and one in thought, but--one in\nsex!\n\nThe thunderous meaning of Estra's last action almost made Billie forget\nthat it was, in truth, the woman's last act. For next moment her\nlifeless form was being crushed beneath the feet of that supremely\ncultured, marvelously civilized mob; for it was only a mob, despite its\nastounding advancement; a mob which had retained all the brute's\nfanaticism, and all the male jealousy of the female.\n\nFor they were all men.\n\n\nThe four had been on Venus almost twenty-four hours when Smith, knowing\nthe condition of the machinery in the cube, warned the others that they\nmust return. Secretly, he was tired of the Venusians' continual smiling;\nfor they had fairly outdone each other to show the visitors all that\ncould be shown. But it was Van Emmon who thought to ask for Estra's\nwonderful library.\n\n\"These chemicals and metals you are giving us,\" he said, making a\nregular speech of it, \"are extremely welcome; they will enable us to\nperform experiments otherwise out of our reach.\n\n\"But Estra's books will mean still more to the people of the earth. If\nthere is no one else with more need for them, who is going to put in a\nclaim, then why not let us have them?\"\n\nApparently the Venusians did not like the idea very well. \"They must\nhave thought it was like letting a monkey play with a rifle,\" the doctor\nafterward put it. But, for lack of a leader with any motive for\nobjecting, and because Estra had no living relatives to claim the\nlibrary, somehow that incredible collection of intellectual gems got\ninto the possession of the four. Nothing was said about it during the\nquiet leave-taking, and when the cube finally rose away from the roof,\nVan Emmon's face beamed with happiness and a great sigh of satisfaction\nescaped him.\n\n\"Well\"--looking at the books--\"they kind of make up for the fact that\nthe folks didn't ask us to call again!\"\n\nAnd he turned and went straight to the kitchenette, where he proceeded\nwith great speed and efficiency to set out the following:\n\nCanned Soup. Canned baked beans. Fried bacon and egg. Coffee. Peaches.\n\n\"Come and get it!\" he shouted. The doctor tore himself away from the\nbooks; Smith crawled out from the beloved machines; Billie came out\nshortly from her cubby-hole, and slipped into her seat in a highly\nexcited manner. There was a brightness in her cheeks, and a noticeable\nchange in her usually assured manner. This timidity, so utterly new to\nthe girl, seemed most pronounced whenever Van Emmon chanced to look at\nher; which was quite often.\n\nAll four were ravenous. They had been away from the cube a day and a\nnight, and \"all we had to eat was something to drink,\" as Smith\ncomplained. Nothing whatever was said except \"Please pass that\" and\n\"Thanks,\" for fully fifteen minutes.\n\nAt last they were satisfied. The doctor went back to the books; Smith\nreturned to his oil-can and wrench. But Billie stood by the table, and\nbegan helping Van Emmon to clear up. In a moment they were face to face.\n\n\"Van,\" she said softly, and looked up at him wistfully. \"Van--do you\nlike me better this way?\" Her eyes were almost piteous.\n\nInto the man's face there came a look of amazement followed by one of\nadmiration, and another of genuine delight He gave a little laugh, and\nunconsciously threw out his hands.\n\n\"Much better, Billie.\" Neither of them cared a particle whether Smith or\nthe doctor saw that Billie, very simply and naturally, walked right into\nVan Emmon's arms. \"Much better. Besides, you're really too graceful to\nwear anything else.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Lord of Death and the Queen of Life\nby Homer Eon Flint\n\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE LORD OF DEATH ***\n\nThis file should be named 5703.txt or 5703.zip\n\nProduced by David Moynihan, Aaron Cannon, Charles Franks\nand the Online Distributed Proofreading Team.\n\nProject Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US\nunless a copyright notice is included.

If the value\nper text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2\nmillion dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text\nfiles per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+\nWe are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002\nIf they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total\nwill reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.\n\nThe Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!\nThis is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,\nwhich is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.\n\nHere is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):\n\neBooks Year Month\n\n    1  1971 July\n   10  1991 January\n  100  1994 January\n 1000  1997 August\n 1500  1998 October\n 2000  1999 December\n 2500  2000 December\n 3000  2001 November\n 4000  2001 October/November\n 6000  2002 December*\n 9000  2003 November*\n10000  2004 January*\n\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created\nto secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.\n\nWe need your donations more than ever!\n\nAs of February, 2002, contributions are being solicited from people\nand organizations in: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut,\nDelaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois,\nIndiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts,\nMichigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New\nHampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio,\nOklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South\nDakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West\nVirginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.\n\nWe have filed in all 50 states now, but these are the only ones\nthat have responded.\n\nAs the requirements for other states are met, additions to this list\nwill be made and fund raising will begin in the additional states.\nPlease feel free to ask to check the status of your state.\n\nIn answer to various questions we have received on this:\n\nWe are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally\nrequest donations in all 50 states.
