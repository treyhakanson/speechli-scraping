The two teams closed.\nRoger threw a perfect block on his opposing wingman and the two boys\nwent down in a heap. Tom side-stepped the _Arcturus_ cadet on his side\nand sent him sprawling to the ground. He quickly cut across the field\nand threw his body headlong at the last remaining member of the\nopposition. Astro was free to kick the ball perfectly for a fifty-yard\ngoal.\n\nJogging back toward their own goal line, the three _Polaris_ cadets\ncongratulated each other. Astro's kick had tied the score, two-all.\n\n\"That was some feint you pulled on Richards, Tom,\" said Roger. \"You\nsucked him in beautifully. I thought he was going to tear up the field\nwith his nose!\"\n\nTom grinned. Compliments from Roger were few and far between.\n\nAstro clapped his hands together and roared, \"All right, fellas, let's\nsee if we can't take these space bums again! Another shot at the\ngoal--that's all I need!\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nLining up at the end of the field again, the cadets kept their eyes on\nthe cadet referee on the side lines. They saw him hold up his hand and\nthen drop it suddenly. Once again the teams raced toward the ball in the\nmiddle of the field. When they met, Roger tried to duplicate Tom's feat\nand feint his opponent, but the other cadet was ready for the maneuver\nand stopped dead in his tracks. Roger was forced to break stride just\nlong enough for the _Arcturus_ cadet to dump him to the ground and then\nrace for Astro. Tom, covering Astro on the left wing, saw the cadet\nsweeping in and lunged in a desperate attempt to stop him. But he\nmissed, leaving Astro unprotected against the three members of the\n_Arcturus_ unit. With his defense gone, Astro kicked at the ball\nfrantically but just grazed the side of it. The mercury inside the ball\nbegan to play its role in the game, and as though it had a brain of its\nown, the ball spun, stopped, bounced, and spiraled in every direction,\nwith the cadets kicking, lunging, and scrambling for a clean shot.\nFinally Astro reached the tumbling sphere and booted it away from the\ngroup. There was a roar of laughter from the _Arcturus_ unit and a low\ngroan from Tom and Roger. Astro saw that he had kicked the ball over his\nown goal line.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Why, you clobber-headed Venusian hick!\" yelled Roger. \"Can't you tell\nthe difference between our goal and theirs?\"\n\nAstro grinned sheepishly as the three jogged back to their own goal to\nline up once more.\n\n\"Lay off, Roger,\" said Tom. \"How come you didn't get Richards on that\nplay?\"\n\n\"I slipped,\" replied the blond cadet.\n\n\"Yeah, you slipped all right,\" growled Astro good-naturedly, \"with a\ngreat big assist from Richards.\"\n\n\"Ah, go blast your jets,\" grumbled Roger. \"Come on! Let's show those\nspace crawlers what this game is all about!\"\n\nBut before the cadet referee could drop his hand, a powerful, low-slung\njet car, its exhaust howling, pulled to a screeching stop at the edge of\nthe field and a scarlet-clad enlisted Solar Guardsman jumped out and\nspoke to him. Sensing that it was something important, the two teams\njogged over to surround the messenger.\n\n\"What's up, Joe?\" asked Roger.\n\nThe enlisted spaceman, an Earthworm cadet who had washed out of the\nAcademy but had re-enlisted in the Solar Guard, smiled. \"Orders for the\n_Polaris_ unit,\" he said, \"from Captain Strong.\"\n\n\"What about?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"Report on the double for new assignments,\" replied the guardsman.\n\n\"_Yeeeeooooow!_\" Astro roared in jubilation. \"At last we can get out of\nhere. I've been doing so blamed much classroom work, I've forgotten what\nspace looks like.\"\n\n\"Know where we're going, Joe?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"Uh-uh.\" Joe shook his head. He turned away, then stopped, and called\nback, \"Want a lift back to the Tower?\"\n\nBefore Tom could answer, Richards, the captain of the _Arcturus_ unit\nspoke up. \"How about finishing the game, Tom? It's been so long since\nwe've had such good competition we hate to lose you. Come on. Only a few\nmore minutes.\"\n\nTom hesitated. It had been a long time since the two units had played\ntogether, but orders were orders. He looked at Roger and Astro. \"Well,\nwhat about it?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said Roger. \"We'll wipe up these space jokers in nothing flat!\nCome on!\"\n\nThere was a mock yell of anger from the _Arcturus_ unit and the two\nteams raced back to their starting positions. In the remaining minutes\nof play, the cadets played hard and rough. First one team would score\nand then the other. A sizable crowd of cadets had gathered to watch the\ngame and cheered lustily as the players tore up and down the field.\nFinally, when both teams were nearly exhausted, the game was over and\nthe score was eight to seven in favor of the _Polaris_ unit. Roger had\nmade the final point after Tony Richards had left the game with a badly\nbruised hip. A substitute called in from the bystanders, an Earthworm\ncadet, had eagerly joined the _Arcturus_ team for the last minutes of\nplay but had been hopelessly outclassed by the teamwork of the _Polaris_\nunit.\n\nPromising a return match soon, Roger, Tom, and Astro hurried to their\nlockers, showered, and dressed in their senior cadet uniforms of vivid\nblue, then raced to the nearest slidewalk to head toward the main group\nof buildings that made up Space Academy.\n\nWhisked along on the moving belt of plastic that formed the principle\nmethod of transportation in and around the Academy grounds, Tom turned\nto his unit mates. \"What do you think it'll be?\" he asked.\n\n\"You mean the assignment?\" asked Roger, answering his own question in\nthe next breath. \"I don't know. But anything to get out of here. I've\nbeen on Earth so long that I'm getting gravity-itis!\"\n\nTom smiled. \"It'll sure be nice to get up in the wide, high, and deep\nagain,\" he said, glancing up at the cloudless sky.\n\n\"Say it again, spaceman,\" breathed Astro. \"One more lesson on the\ndifferential potential between chemical-burning rocket fuels and\nreactant energy and I'll blast off without a spaceship!\"\n\nRoger and Tom laughed. They both sympathized with the big cadet's\ninability to cope with the theory of atomic energy and fuel conservation\nin spaceships. In charge of the power deck on the _Polaris_, Astro\nearlier had gained firsthand experience in commercial rocket ships as an\nable spaceman and later had been accepted in the Academy for cadet\ntraining. The son of colonists on Venus, the misty planet, his formal\neducation was limited, and though he had no equal while on the power\ndeck of a rocket ship, in theory and classroom study he had to depend on\nRoger and Tom to help him get passing grades.\n\nThe slidewalk moved smoothly and easily toward the gleaming Tower of\nGalileo, the largest and most imposing of the structures of Space\nAcademy. Made entirely of clear crystal mined on Titan, satellite of\nSaturn, the Tower rose over the smaller buildings like a giant\nshimmering jewel. Housing the administration offices of the Solar Guard\nand the Space Academy staff, it also contained Galaxy Hall, the museum\nof space, which attracted thousands of visitors from every part of the\nSolar Alliance.\n\nTom Corbett, his eyes caressing the magnificent gleaming Tower,\nremembered the first time he had seen it. While it hadn't been so long\nin months or years since becoming a Space Cadet, it seemed as though he\nhad been at the Academy all of his life and that it was his home. In the\nstruggle to develop into a well-knit dependable rocket team, composed of\nan astrogator, power-deck cadet, and a command cadet, Tom had assumed\nthe leadership of the unit, and the relationship between Astro, Roger\nManning, and himself had ripened until they were more like brothers than\nthree young men who had grown up millions of miles apart.\n\nAs they rode toward the Tower, the three cadets could see the green-clad\nfirst-year Earthworms getting their first taste of cadet life--hours of\nclose-order formations and drills. The nearer they came to the Tower,\nthe more intense and colorful became the activity as the crisscrossing\nslidewalks carried enlisted guardsmen in their red uniforms, and the\nofficers of the Solar Guard in magnificent black and gold, across the\nquadrangle to the various dormitories, laboratories, lecture rooms, mess\nhalls, and research rooms. Space Academy was a beehive of activity, with\nthe education of thousands of cadets and the operational mechanics of\nthe Solar Guard going on incessantly, day and night, never stopping in\nits avowed task of defending the liberties of the planets, safeguarding\nthe freedom of space, and upholding the cause of peace throughout the\nuniverse.\n\nAs their slidewalk glided over the quadrangle, Roger suddenly turned to\nhis unit mates. \"Think we might get assigned to that radar project\nthey're setting up on the Moon?\" he asked. \"I have a few ideas--\"\n\nTom laughed. \"He can't wait until he gets his hands on that new scanner\nDr. Dale just finished, Astro,\" he said with a wink.\n\nThe big Venusian snorted. \"Can you imagine the ego of that guy? Dr. Dale\nspends almost a year building that thing, with the help of the leading\nelectronic scientists in the Alliance, and _he_ can't wait to _tell_\nthem about a few of _his_ ideas!\"\n\n\"I didn't mean that,\" complained Roger. \"All I said was--\"\n\n\"You don't have to say a word, hot-shot,\" interrupted Astro. \"I can read\nyour thoughts as though they were flashed on a stereo screen!\"\n\n\"Oh, yeah!\" growled Roger. \"You should be that telepathic for your\nexams. Why didn't you read my thoughts when I beat my brains out trying\nto explain that thrust problem the other night?\" He turned to Tom,\nshrugging his shoulders in mock despair. \"Honestly, Tom, if I didn't\nknow that he was the best power jockey in the Academy, I'd say he was\nthe dumbest thing to leave Venus, _including_ the dinosaurs in the\nAcademy Zoo!\"\n\nWith a hamlike hand Astro suddenly grabbed for Roger's neck, but the\nwiry cadet dashed along the slidewalk out of reach and the big Venusian\nrumbled after him. Tom roared with laughter.\n\nAs he started to follow his unit mates, one of the passengers on the\nslidewalk grabbed Tom by the arm and he turned to see Mike McKenny,\nChief Warrant Officer in the enlisted Solar Guard and the first\ninstructor the _Polaris_ unit had met on their arrival at the Academy.\n\n\"Corbett!\" demanded McKenny. \"Are those two space crawlers still acting\nlike monkeys out of their cages?\"\n\nTom laughed and shook hands with the elderly spaceman. \"Yes, sir,\" he\nsaid. \"But you could hardly call Astro a monkey!\"\n\n\"More along the lines of a Venusian gorilla, if you ask me!\" snorted\nMcKenny. The short, squat spaceman's eyes twinkled. \"I've been hearing\nsome mighty fine things about you three space bongos, Tommy. It's a\nwonder the Solar Guard didn't give you a unit citation for aiding in the\ncapture of Coxine, the pirate!\"\n\n\"Thanks, Mike. Coming from you that compliment really means something!\"\n\n\"Just be sure you keep those two space lunatics in their proper cages,\"\nsaid Mike, indicating Roger and Astro, who at the moment were racing\nback and forth along the slidewalk bumping passengers left and right,\n\"and you'll all be heroes someday.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Tom. He glanced up, and noticing that he was in front\nof the Tower building, hopped to the walkway, waving a cheery good-by to\nMike. \"Blast over to our mess and have dinner with us some night, Mike!\"\nhe yelled to the departing figure.\n\n\"And interrupt the happiest hours in Astro's life?\" bawled Mike. \"No\nthank you!\"\n\nTom laughed and turned to the huge open doorway of the Tower where Roger\nand Astro waited for him impatiently. In a few moments the three were\nbeing carried to the upper floors of the crystal structure by a\nspiraling band of moving plastic that stretched from the top of the\nTower to the many floors below surface level. Tom glanced at his wrist\nchronograph as they stepped off the slidestairs and headed for Captain\nStrong's quarters.\n\n\"We're about twenty minutes late,\" he said to Roger and Astro. \"Hope\nCaptain Strong's in good spirits!\"\n\n\"If he isn't,\" said Roger, \"we can--\"\n\n\"Don't say it,\" protested Astro. \"I only just finished working off my\nlast bunch of galley demerits.\"\n\nThey stopped in front of a door, straightened their uniforms, and then\nslid the door to one side and stepped smartly into the room. They came\nto rigid attention before a massive desk, flanked by two wall windows of\nclear sheet crystal reaching from ceiling to floor. Standing at the\nwindow, Captain Steve Strong, _Polaris_ unit cadet supervisor, his broad\nshoulders stretching under his black-and-gold uniform, turned to face\nthem, his features set in grim lines of trouble.\n\n\"_Polaris_ unit reporting for orders, sir,\" said Tom. The three cadets\nsaluted crisply.\n\nStrong snapped a return salute and walked to the front of his desk.\n\"Getting pretty big for your britches, aren't you?\" he growled. \"I've\nbeen watching you from this window. I saw the messenger deliver my\norders to you, and then, I saw you return to your game and finish it,\napparently deciding that the business of the Solar Guard can wait!\"\n\n\"But, sir--\" Roger started to say.\n\n\"Close your exhaust, Manning!\" snapped Strong. \"I'm doing the talking!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" stammered the blond-haired cadet.\n\n\"Well, Cadets,\" asked Strong in a silken voice, \"if I sent you to\nCommander Walters' office _on the double_, do you think I could trust\nyou to get there on the _double_?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, sir,\" replied Tom. \"_Yes, sir!_\" The other two boys nodded\nviolently.\n\n\"Then blast out of here and report to Commander Walters for your\nassignments. Tell him I'll be there in a few minutes.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\" said Tom, and the three cadets saluted sharply.\n\n\"Unit--\" bawled Strong, \"_dis_--missed!\"\n\nOutside in the hall once more, the three cadets wiped their faces.\n\n\"Captain Strong definitely was not in a good mood!\" commented Roger.\n\n\"I've never seen him so angry!\" said Tom. \"Wonder why.\"\n\n\"Think it might be something to do with our assignments?\" asked Astro.\n\n\"Never can tell, Astro,\" said Tom. \"And there's only one way to find\nout. That's to get to Commander Walters' office on the double!\"\n\nWithout another word the cadets hurried to the slidestairs, each of\nthem hungry for excitement. Already having participated in three\noutstanding adventures, the cadet members of the _Polaris_ unit were\neager to begin a fourth.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\n\n\"There's no doubt that the success or failure of this project will\ninfluence the thinking of the Solar Alliance with regard to further\nexpansion, Governor Hardy,\" said Commander Walters to the man sitting\nstiffly in front of him. \"And my congratulations on your appointment to\nhead the expedition.\"\n\nA tall, lean man with iron-gray hair, the commander of Space Academy,\nsat behind his desk, back ramrod straight in his black-and-gold senior\nofficer's uniform, and casually toyed with a paper cutter on his desk as\nhe spoke to Christopher Hardy, a short, thin man with a balding head and\nsharp features.\n\n\"Thank you, Commander,\" replied Hardy, in a thin, reedy voice. \"It's a\ngreat honor and I certainly don't foresee anything that can prevent the\nexpedition from being a complete success. We have the best equipment\nand, I hope, we'll have the finest men.\"\n\nThe soft chime of a muted bell interrupted Walters as he was about to\nreply. He opened the switch to the interoffice teleceiver behind his\ndesk, then watched the image of his aide appear on the teleceiver\nscreen.\n\n\"What is it, Bill?\" asked Walters.\n\n\"_Polaris_ unit reporting for orders, sir,\" replied the enlisted\nguardsman. \"Cadets Corbett, Manning, and Astro.\"\n\n\"Very well, send them in,\" said Walters. Switching off the teleceiver,\nhe turned back to Governor Hardy. \"Ever hear of the _Polaris_ unit,\nsir?\" he asked.\n\nHardy paused, rubbing his chin before answering. \"No, can't say that I\nhave.\" He smiled. \"From the look on your face, I see I should know about\nthem, though.\"\n\nWalters smiled back. \"I'll just say this about them. Of all the cadet\nunits trained here at the Academy in the last twenty years, these three\nlads are just about perfection. Just the material you'll need on your\ninitial operation.\"\n\nGovernor Hardy raised his hand in mock protest. \"Please! No brain\ntrusts!\"\n\n\"Well, they have the brains all right.\" Walters laughed. \"But they have\nsomething else, an instinctive ability to do the right thing at the\nright time and that indefinable something that makes them true men of\nspace, rather than ordinary ground hogs simply transplanted into space.\"\n\nAs the commander spoke, the massive door to his office rolled back and\nTom, Roger, and Astro stepped in briskly, coming to stiff attention in\nfront of the desk.\n\n\"_Polaris_ unit reporting for duty, sir,\" said Tom. \"Cadets Corbett,\nManning, and Astro.\"\n\n\"At ease,\" said Walters.\n\nThe three boys relaxed and glanced quickly at the governor who had\nwatched their entrance with interest. Walters came around in front of\nthe desk and gestured toward Hardy.\n\n\"Boys, I want you to meet Governor Hardy.\"\n\nThe three cadets nodded respectfully. They knew all about the governor's\nachievements in establishing the first colony on Ganymede, and his\nsuccess with the first exploratory expedition to outer space.\n\n\"Sit down, boys,\" said Walters, indicating a near-by couch. \"Governor\nHardy will explain things from here on in. Where is Captain Strong?\"\n\n\"He said he'd be along in a few moments, sir,\" replied Roger.\n\n\"Well,\" said Walters, turning to Hardy, \"no sense in beginning without\nSteve. Only have to repeat yourself.\" He turned to Astro but not before\nhe saw a grimace of annoyance cloud the governor's face. \"How are you\nmaking out with your classroom studies, Astro?\"\n\n\"Uh--ah--\" stammered the giant Venusian, \"I'm doing all right, sir,\" he\nmanaged finally.\n\nWalters suppressed a smile and turned to Hardy.\n\n\"One of the most important aspects of our training methods here at the\nAcademy, Governor,\" began Walters, returning to his desk, \"is for the\ncadet to learn to depend on his unit mates. Take Astro, for instance.\"\n\nThe two men glanced at the big cadet who shuffled his feet in\nembarrassment at being the center of attention.\n\n\"Astro,\" continued Walters, \"is rather shaky in the field of theory and\nabstract-scientific concepts. Yet he is capable of handling practically\nany situation on the power deck of a spaceship. He literally thinks with\nhis hands.\"\n\n\"Most commendable,\" commented Hardy dryly. \"But I should think it would\nbe difficult if he ever came face to face with a situation where his\nhands were bound.\" There was the lightest touch of sarcasm in his voice.\n\n\"I assure you, Governor,\" said Walters, \"that wouldn't stop him either.\nBut my point is this: Since a cadet unit is assembled only after careful\nstudy of their individual psychograph personality charts and is passed\nand failed as a unit, even though a boy like Cadet Astro might make a\nfailing grade, his unit mates, Cadets Manning and Corbett, can pull him\nthrough by making higher passing marks. You see, an average is taken for\nall three and they pass or fail as a unit.\"\n\n\"Then they are forced, more or less, to depend on each other?\" asked\nHardy.\n\n\"Yes. In the beginning of their training. Later on, the cadets learn for\nthemselves that it is better for all of them to work together.\"\n\nOnce again the bell in back of Walters' desk chimed and he turned to\nspeak on the teleceiver to his aide.\n\n\"Captain Strong is here, sir,\" repeated the enlisted man.\n\n\"Send him right in,\" said Walters. Seconds later the door slid back and\nSteve Strong entered and saluted.\n\nAfter the introductions were completed and the Solar Guard captain had\ntaken a seat with his cadet unit, Commander Walters immediately launched\ninto the purpose of the meeting.\n\n\"Steve,\" he began, \"Governor Hardy here has been appointed by the Solar\nCouncil to head one of the most important projects yet attempted by the\nAlliance.\"\n\nThe cadets edged to the front of the couch and listened intently for\nwhat the commander was about to say.\n\n\"But perhaps I had better let the governor tell you about it himself,\"\nconcluded Walters abruptly and settled back in his chair.\n\nCaptain Strong and the cadets swung around to face the governor, who\nrose and looked at each of them steadily before speaking.\n\n\"Commander Walters stressed the fact that this was an important\nproject,\" he said finally. \"No one can say how important it will be for\nthe future. It might mean the beginning of an entirely new era in the\ndevelopment of mankind.\" He paused again. \"The Solar Alliance has\ndecided to establish a new colony,\" he announced. \"The first colony of\nits kind outside the solar system in deep space!\"\n\n\"A star colony!\" gasped Strong.\n\nThe cadets muttered excitedly among themselves.\n\n\"The decision,\" continued the governor, \"has been made only after much\ndebate in the Solar Council Chamber. There have been many arguments pro\nand con. A week ago a secret vote was taken, and the project was\napproved. We are going to establish a Solar Alliance colony on a newly\ndiscovered satellite in orbit around the sun star Wolf 359, a satellite\nthat has been named Roald.\"\n\n\"Wolf 359!\" exclaimed Roger. \"That's more than thirteen light years\naway--\" He was stopped by Tom's hand clamped across his mouth.\n\nGovernor Hardy looked at Roger and smiled. \"Yes, Wolf 359 is pretty far\naway, especially for a colony. But preliminary expeditions have\ninvestigated and found the satellite suitable for habitation, with\nfertile soil and an atmosphere similar to our own. With the aid of a few\natmosphere booster stations, it should be as easy for a colonist to live\nthere as he would on Venus--or any tropical planet.\"\n\n\"Where are you going to get the colonists, sir?\" asked Strong.\n\nHardy began to pace back and forth in front of Walters' desk, waving his\nhands as he warmed up to his subject. \"Tonight, on a special combined\naudioceiver and teleceiver broadcast to all parts of the Solar Alliance,\nthe president of the Solar Council will ask for volunteers--men who will\ntake man's first step through deep space to the stars. It is a step,\nwhich, in the thousands of years ahead, will eventually lead to a\ncivilization of Earthmen throughout all space!\"\n\nTom, Roger, and Astro sat in silent awe as they listened to the plans\nfor man to reach toward the stars. Spacemen by nature and adventurers in\nspirit, they were united in the belief that some day Earthmen would set\nfoot on all the stars and never stop until they had seen the last sun,\nthe last world, the last unexplored corner of the cosmos.\n\n\"The colonists,\" continued Hardy, \"will come from all over the system.\nOne thousand of them--the strongest and sturdiest men out of the\nbillions that inhabit the planets around us; one thousand, to live on\nRoald for a period of seven years.\"\n\nTom, his eyes bright, asked, \"Won't everybody want to go, sir?\"\n\nWalters and Hardy smiled. \"We expect a rush, Corbett,\" answered Walters.\n\"You three and Captain Strong have been selected to aid in screening the\napplicants.\"\n\n\"Will there be any special tests, sir?\" asked Strong. \"I have to agree\nwith Corbett that just about everyone will want to go.\"\n\n\"Yes, Strong,\" said Hardy. \"Everyone _will_ want to go. In fact, we\nestimate that there will be literally millions of applicants!\"\n\nRoger emitted a long, low whistle. \"It'll take years to screen all of\nthem, sir.\"\n\nHardy smiled. \"Not really, Manning. The psychographs will eliminate the\nhundreds of thousands of misfits, the men who will want to go for\nselfish reasons, who are running away from the past, or are dissatisfied\nwith their lack of success in life and embittered because of failure. We\ncan expect many criminal types. Those will be eliminated easily. We have\nset a specific quota from each of the satellites, planets, and asteroid\ncolonies. I have already established the stations for the preliminary\nscreening. We will screen the remainder until we have the required\nthousand.\"\n\n\"What will our part be, sir?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"Once each applicant has been approved by the psychographs, his\nbackground will be thoroughly investigated. We may find criminal types\nwho show the blackest of careers, but who would turn over a new leaf if\ngiven the chance and prove to be more valuable than men with the best of\nbackgrounds who merely want to get away from it all. We don't want that\nkind of colonist. We want people who have faith in the project; people\nwho are not afraid of work and hardships. Your screening job will be\nsimple. Each of you has a special talent which Commander Walters feels\nis outstanding. Corbett in leadership, administration, and command;\nManning in electronics; Astro in atomic power and propulsion. You will\ntalk to the applicants and give them simple tests. An important point in\nany applicant's favor will be his ability to improvise and handle three,\nfour, or five jobs, where a less imaginative person would do but one.\nTalk to them, sound them out, and then write your report. Captain Strong\nwill review your opinions and make recommendations to me. I will finally\napprove or disapprove the applications.\"\n\n\"Will this cost the applicants anything, sir?\" asked Roger. \"For\ninstance, will the rich applicants have a better chance than the poor?\"\n\nHardy's face turned grim. \"Only the people that fit our standards will\nbe allowed to go, Manning. Regardless.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Roger.\n\n\"The Solar Alliance,\" continued Hardy, \"has established a fund for this\nproject. Each applicant will be lent as much in material as he needs to\nestablish himself on Roald. If he operates an exchange, for instance,\nselling clothes, equipment, or food, then the size of his exchange will\ndetermine the size of the loan. He will repay the Solar Alliance by\nreturning one-fourth of his profits over a period of seven years. Each\ncolonist will be required to remain on the satellite for that seven-year\nperiod. After that, should he leave, he would be required to sell all\nhis rights and property on Roald.\"\n\n\"And the farmers, sir,\" asked Tom, \"and all the rest. Will they all be\ntreated the same way?\"\n\n\"Exactly the same, according to their individual abilities. Of course we\nwouldn't take a man who had been a shoemaker and advance him the capital\nto become a farmer.\"\n\n\"Will the quota of one thousand colonists include women and children?\"\nasked Astro.\n\n\"No, but allowances have been made for them. One thousand colonists\nmeans one thousand men _who can produce_. However, a man may take his\nfamily,\" Hardy went on, adding, \"providing, of course, that he doesn't\nmean twenty-three children, aunts, uncles, and so forth.\"\n\nThe three cadets looked at each other dumfounded. The very idea of the\nproject was staggering, and as Strong, Hardy, and Commander Walters\nbegan to discuss the details of the screening system, they turned to\neach other excitedly.\n\n\"This is the greatest thing that's happened since Jon Builker made his\ntrip into deep space!\" whispered Tom.\n\n\"Yeah,\" nodded Astro, \"but I'm scared.\"\n\n\"About what?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"Having the responsibility of saying No to a feller that wants to go.\"\n\nThe big cadet seemed to be worried and Tom attempted to explain what the\njob would really be.\n\n\"It's not a question of saying an outright No,\" said Tom. \"You just ask\nthe applicant about his experience with motors and reactors to see if he\nreally knows his stuff.\"\n\nAstro seemed to accept Tom's explanation, but he still seemed concerned\nas they all turned to Commander Walters, who had finished the discussion\naround the desk and was giving Captain Strong his orders.\n\n\"You and the cadets, along with Governor Hardy, will blast off tonight\nand go to Venusport for the first screenings.\" He faced the cadets. \"You\nthree boys have a tremendous responsibility. In many cases your\ndecisions might mean the difference between success or failure in this\nmission. See that you make good decisions, and when you've made them,\nstick by them. You will be under the direct supervision of Captain\nStrong and Governor Hardy. This is quite different from your previous\nassignments, but I have faith in you. See that you handle yourselves\nlike spacemen.\"\n\nThe three cadets saluted sharply, and after shaking hands with their\ncommander, left the room.\n\nLater that evening, their gear packed, the three members of the\n_Polaris_ unit were checked out of the Academy by the dormitory officer\nand were soon being whisked along on a slidewalk to the Academy\nspaceport. As they neared the spacious concrete field, where the mighty\nfleet of the Solar Guard was based, they could see the rows of rocket\ncruisers, destroyers, scouts, and various types of merchant space craft,\nand in the center, on a launching platform, the silhouette of the rocket\ncruiser _Polaris_ stood out boldly against the pale evening sky. Resting\non her directional fins, her nose pointed skyward, her gleaming hull\nreflecting the last rays of the setting sun, the ship was a powerful\nprojectile ready to blast off for distant worlds.\n\n[Illustration: _Her nose pointed skyward, the_ Polaris _was ready to\nblast off_]\n\nReaching the _Polaris_, the three cadets scrambled through the air\nlock into the spaceship and prepared for blast-off.\n\nOn the control deck, Tom began the involved check of the control panel.\nOne by one, he tested the dials, gauges, and indicators on the\ninstrument panel that was the brains of the mighty ship.\n\nOn the radar bridge, above the control deck, Roger adjusted the sights\nof the precious astrogation prism and took a checking sight on the Pole\nStar to make sure the instrument was in true alignment. Then turning to\nthe radar scanner, the all-seeing eye of the ship, he began a slow,\ndeliberate tracking of each circuit in the maze of wiring.\n\nAnd below on the power deck, Astro, stripped to the waist, a leather\nbelt filled with the rocketman's wrenches and tools slung around his\nhips, tuned up the mighty atomic engines. He took longer than usual,\nmaking sure the lead baffling around the reactor units and the reaction\nchamber was secure, before firing the initial mass.\n\nFinally Tom's voice crackled over the intercom, \"Control deck to all\nstations. Check in!\"\n\n\"Radar bridge, aye!\" came Roger's reply. \"Ready for blast-off!\"\n\n\"Power deck, aye!\" said Astro, his booming voice echoing through the\nship. \"Ready for blast-off!\"\n\n\"Control deck, ready for blast-off,\" said Tom, and then turned to the\nlogbook and jotted down the time in the ship's journal. The astral\nchronometer over the control board read exactly 1350 hours.\n\nFifteen minutes later Captain Strong and Governor Hardy climbed aboard\nand Tom received the order to raise ship.\n\nThe young curly-haired cadet turned to the control board and flipped on\nthe teleceiver. \"Rocket cruiser _Polaris_ to spaceport control tower,\"\nhe called. \"Request blast-off orbit and clearance!\"\n\nThe traffic-control officer in the spaceport tower answered immediately.\n\"Control tower to _Polaris_. You are cleared for blast-off at 1405\nhours, orbital tangent 867.\"\n\nTom repeated the instructions and turned to the intercom and began\nsnapping out orders. \"Power deck, energize the cooling pumps!\"\n\n\"Power deck, aye!\" replied Astro. The slow whine of the powerful pumps\nbegan to scream through the ship. Tom watched the pressure indicator and\nwhen it reached the blast-off mark called to Roger for clearance.\n\n\"All clear, forward and up!\" declared Roger.\n\n\"Feed reactant at D-9 rate!\" ordered Tom. And far below on the power\ndeck, Astro began to feed the reactant energy into the firing chambers.\n\nHardy looked at Strong and nodded in appreciation of the cadets' smooth\nefficient work. They strapped themselves into acceleration cushions and\nwatched the red second hand of the astral chronometer sweep around, and\nthen heard Tom counting off the seconds.\n\n\"Blast off--\" bawled Tom, \"minus five--four--three--two--one--_zeroooo!_\"\n\nThe giant ship lurched off the blast-off platform a few feet, the\nexhaust of the powerful rockets deflected against the concrete surface.\nThen, poised delicately on the roaring rockets, the mighty ship picked\nup speed and began to accelerate through the atmosphere.\n\nPushed deep in his acceleration chair in front of the control board,\nunable to move because of the tremendous pressure against his body, Tom\nCorbett thought about his new adventure. And as the ship hurtled into\nthe black velvet depths of space, he wondered what the future held for\nhim as he and his unit mates began a new adventure among the stars.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\n\n\"Control deck to power deck, check in!\" Tom's voice crackled over the\npower-deck loud-speaker and Astro snapped to quick attention.\n\n\"Power deck, aye!\" replied the giant Venusian into the intercom\nmicrophone. \"What's up?\"\n\n\"Stand by for course change,\" said Tom. \"Roger's picked up a meteor on\nthe radar scanner and--\"\n\n\"Here's the course change,\" Roger's voice broke in over the intercom.\n\"Three degrees up on the plane of the ecliptic and five degrees\nstarboard!\"\n\n\"Get that, Astro?\" snapped Tom. \"Stand by for one-quarter burst on\nsteering rockets!\"\n\n\"One-quarter--right!\" acknowledged the power-deck cadet and turned to\nthe massive panel that controlled the rockets.\n\nOn the control deck Tom Corbett continued talking to Roger. \"Relay the\npickup to the control-deck scanner, Roger,\" he ordered. \"Let me take a\nlook at that thing.\"\n\nIn a moment the thin sweeping white line on the control-deck scanner\nswept around the green surface of the screen, picking out the blip that\nmarked the meteor. Tom watched it for a moment and then barked into the\nintercom, \"Stand by to execute change course!\"\n\nHe watched the meteor a few more seconds, making sure the course change\nwould take them out of its path, and then gave the command. \"Fire!\"\n\nBefore he could draw another breath, Tom felt himself pressed into his\nseat as the _Polaris_ quickly accelerated and curved up and away from\nthe onrushing meteor in a long, smooth arc.\n\nCaptain Strong suddenly stepped through the hatch into the control deck.\nGlancing quickly at the scanner screen, he saw the white blip that was\nthe meteor flashing away from the _Polaris_ and he smiled.\n\n\"That was nice work, Corbett!\" said Strong. \"Get us back on course as\nsoon as you can. Governor Hardy wants to get to Venusport as quickly as\npossible.\"\n\n\"Shall I tell Astro to pour on extra thrust, sir?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"No, just maintain standard full space speed. No need to use emergency\npower unless it's really an emergency.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Tom.\n\nStrong walked around on the control deck, making a casual check of the\nship's operation. But he knew he wouldn't find anything to complain\nabout. Past experience had taught him that the three cadets kept a tight\nship. At the sound of the hatch opening, he turned to see Governor Hardy\nstanding just inside the hatch.\n\n\"I have to compliment you, Captain,\" Hardy said as he watched Tom\noperate the great control panel. \"Your cadets really know their\nbusiness. You've trained them well.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" replied Strong, \"but they did it themselves. One thing\nI've learned since I've become an instructor at the Academy and that is\nyou can't make a spaceman. He's born with the feeling and the instinct,\nor he isn't a spaceman.\"\n\nHardy nodded. \"I've got some important messages to send out, Captain.\nI'd like to use the teleceiver for a while.\"\n\n\"Of course, sir,\" said Strong. \"Right up that ladder there.\" The Solar\nGuard captain pointed to the ladder leading to the radar deck.\n\"Manning's on duty now and will take care of you, sir.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said the governor, turning to the ladder.\n\nA moment later, as Captain Strong and Tom were idly discussing the\nforthcoming screening operations on Venusport, they were surprised to\nsee Roger climb down the ladder from the radar bridge.\n\n\"What are you doing down here, Manning?\" inquired Strong. \"I thought you\nwere sending out messages for Governor Hardy.\"\n\nRoger dropped into the co-control pilots' seat and shrugged. \"The\ngovernor said he'd handle it. Said the messages were top secret and that\nhe wouldn't _burden_ me with their contents, since he knew how to\noperate a teleceiver!\"\n\nPuzzled, Tom looked at Roger. \"What could be so secret about this\nmission?\" he asked.\n\n\"I don't know,\" answered Roger. \"After that speech the president of the\nSolar Council made the other night, the whole Alliance must know about\nthe project, the screening, and practically everything else.\"\n\nStrong laughed. \"You space brats see adventure and mystery in\neverything. Now, why wouldn't a man in charge of a project as large as\nthis have secret messages? He might be talking to the president of the\ncouncil!\"\n\nTom blushed. \"You're right, sir,\" he said. \"I guess I let my imagination\nrun riot.\"\n\n\"Just concentrate on getting this wagon to Venus in one piece, Corbett,\nand leave the secret messages to the governor,\" joked Strong. \"And any\ntime you get too suspicious, just remember that the governor was\nappointed head of this project by the Solar Alliance itself!\"\n\nBlasting through space, leaving a trail of atomic exhaust behind her,\nthe _Polaris_ rocketed smoothly through the dark void toward the misty\nplanet of Venus. In rotating watches, the cadets ran the ship, ate,\nslept, and spent their few remaining spare hours attending to their\nclassroom work with the aid of soundscribers and story spools. Each of\nthem was working for the day when he would wear the black-and-gold\nuniform of the Solar Guard officer that was respected throughout the\nsystem as the mark of merit, hard work, distinction, and honor.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nOnce, Captain Strong and Astro donned space suits and went outside to\ninspect the hull of the _Polaris_. The ship had passed through a swarm\nof small meteorites, each less than a tenth of an inch in diameter but\ntraveling at high speeds, and some had pierced the hull. It was a simple\nand quick job to seal the holes with a special atomic torch.\n\nLike a giant silver bullet speeding toward a bull's-eye, the rocket ship\npin-pointed the planet Venus from among the millions of worlds in space\nand was soon hovering over Venusport, nose up toward space, ready for a\ntouchdown at the municipal spaceport. As the braking rockets quickly\nstopped all forward acceleration, the main rockets were cut in and the\ngiant ship dropped toward the surface of the tropical planet tailfirst.\n\nTom's face glowed with excitement as he adjusted one lever and then\nanother, delicately balancing the ship in its fall, meanwhile talking\ninto the intercom and directing Astro in the careful reduction of\nthrust. On the radar deck Roger kept his eyes glued to the radar scanner\nand posted Tom on the altitude as the ship drew closer and closer to the\nground.\n\n\"One thousand feet!\" yelled Roger over the intercom. \"Nine\nhundred--eight--seven--six--\"\n\n\"Open main rockets one half!\" called Tom. \"Reduce rate of fall!\"\n\nThe thunder of the rockets increased and the mighty ship quivered as its\nplummeting descent was checked slightly. Tom quickly adjusted the\nstabilizer trim tabs to keep the ship perpendicular to the ground, then\nwatched the stern scanner carefully as the huge blast-pitted concrete\nramp loomed larger and larger.\n\n\"Five hundred feet to touchdown,\" tolled Roger in more slow and measured\ntones. \"Four hundred--three--two--\"\n\nOn the scanner screen Tom could see the exhaust flare begin to lick at\nthe concrete ramp, then splash its surface until it was completely\nhidden. He grasped the main control switch tightly and waited.\n\n\"One hundred feet,\" Roger's voice was tense now. \"Seventy-five, fifty--\"\n\nTom barked out a quick order. \"Blast all rockets!\"\n\nIn immediate response, the main tubes roared into thunderous life and\nthe _Polaris_ shook as the sudden acceleration battled the force of\ngravity. The ship's descent slowed perceptibly until she hovered\nmotionless in the air, her stabilizer fins only two feet from the\nconcrete ramp.\n\n\"Cut all power!\" Tom's voice blasted through the intercom. A split\nsecond later there was a deafening silence, followed by a heavy muffled\nthud and the creak of straining metal as the _Polaris_ came to rest on\nthe ramp.\n\n\"_Touchdown!_\" yelled Tom. He quickly cut all power to the control board\nand watched as one by one the gauges and dials registered zero or empty.\nThe cadet stood up, noticed the time on the astral chronometer, and\nturned to face Captain Strong, rising from the chair beside him.\n\n\"_Polaris_ made touchdown, planet Venus, at exactly 1543, sir,\" he said\nand saluted crisply.\n\nStrong returned the salute. \"Good work, Corbett,\" he said. \"You handled\nher as though she was nothing more than a baby carriage!\"\n\nRoger came bouncing down the ladder, grinning. \"Well,\" he said, \"we're\nback on the planet where the monkeys walk around and call themselves\nmen!\"\n\n\"I heard that, Manning!\" roared Astro, struggling through the hatch from\nthe power deck. \"One more crack like that and I'll stand you on your\nhead and blast you off with your own space gas!\"\n\n\"Listen, you overgrown Venusian ape,\" replied Roger, \"I'll--\"\n\n\"Yeah--\" growled Astro, advancing on the smaller cadet. \"You'll what?\"\n\n\"All right, you two!\" barked Strong. \"Plug your jets! By the craters of\nLuna, one minute you act like hot-shot spacemen, and the next, you\nbehave like children in a kindergarten!\"\n\nSuddenly the compartment echoed to hearty laughter. The cadets and their\nskipper turned to see Governor Hardy standing on the radar-bridge\nladder, brief case in hand, roaring with laughter. He climbed down and\nfaced the three cadets.\n\n\"If kindergarten behavior will produce spacemen like you, I'm all for\nit. Congratulations, all three of you. You did a good job!\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said Tom.\n\nHardy turned to Strong. \"Captain, I'm going ahead to the Solar Council\nbuilding and get things set up for the screening. I imagine there are\nmany anxious colonists ready to be processed!\"\n\nAs Strong and the cadets came to attention and saluted, Governor Hardy\nturned and left the control deck.\n\nStrong turned to the cadets. \"From now on, you might as well forget that\nyou're spacemen. Report to the Administration Building in one hour.\nYou're going to do all your space jockeying in a chair from now on!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor the next week, the three Space Cadets spent every waking hour in the\nSolar Council Administration Center, interviewing applicants who had\npassed their psychograph personality tests. Endlessly, from early\nmorning until late at night, they questioned the eager applicants.\nNinety-nine out of one hundred were refused. And when they were, they\nall had different reactions. Some cried, some were angry, some\nthreatened, but the three cadets were unyielding. It was a thankless\njob, and after more than a week of it, tempers were on edge.\n\n\"What would you do,\" Roger would ask an applicant, \"if you were suddenly\ndrifting in space, in danger, and found that you had lost the vacuum in\nyour audio tubes? How would you get help?\"\n\nNot one in over three hundred had realized that space itself was a\nperfect vacuum and could be substituted for the tubes. Roger had turned\nthumbs down on all of them.\n\nAstro and Tom found their interviews equally as rough. One applicant\nadmitted to Tom that he wanted to go to the satellite to establish a\nfactory for making rocket juice, a highly potent drink that was not\noutlawed in the solar system, but was looked on with strong disfavor.\nWhen Tom turned down his application, the man tried to get Tom to enter\ninto partnership with him, and when Tom refused, the man became violent\nand the cadet had to call enlisted Solar Guardsmen to throw him out.\n\nWhile Tom and Roger made decisions quickly and decisively, Astro, on the\nother hand, patiently listened to all the tearful stories and\nsympathized with the applicants when they were unable to tear down a\nsmall reactor unit and rebuild it blindfolded. Painfully, sometimes with\ntears in his own eyes, he would tell the applicant he had failed, just\nwhen the would-be colonist would think Astro was going to pass him.\n\nThe three cadets were doing their jobs so well that in the one hundred\nand fifty-three applications approved by them Strong did not reject one,\nbut sent them all on to Governor Hardy for final approval.\n\nOn the morning of the tenth day of screening, Hyram Logan and his\nfamily entered Roger's small office. A man of medium height with a thick\nshock of iron-gray hair and ruddy, weather-beaten features Logan looked\nas though he was used to working in the outdoors. Flanked by his son and\ndaughter, he stood quietly before the desk as the young cadet, without\nlooking up, scanned his application quickly.\n\n\"How old are the children?\" asked Roger brusquely.\n\n\"I'm nineteen,\" replied a low musical voice, \"and Billy's twelve.\"\n\nRoger's head suddenly jerked up. He stared past Hyram Logan and a small\ntowheaded boy, to gaze into the warm brown eyes of Jane Logan, a\nslender, pretty girl whose open, friendly features were framed by neatly\ncombed reddish blond hair. Roger sat staring at her, openmouthed, until\nhe heard a loud cough and saw Logan trying to hide a smile. He quickly\nturned back to the application.\n\n\"I see here you're a farmer, Mr. Logan,\" said Roger. He stole a glance\nat the young girl, but Billy saw him and winked. Roger flushed and\nturned to Logan as the older man answered his questioner.\n\n\"That's right,\" said Logan. \"I'm a farmer. Been a farmer all my life.\"\n\n\"Why do you want to go to Roald, Mr. Logan?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"Well,\" said Logan, \"I have a nice piece of land south of Venusport a\nways. Me and my wife developed it and we've been farming it for over\ntwenty-five years. But my wife died last year and I just sort of lost\nheart in this place. I figured maybe that new satellite will give me a\nstart again. You'll have to have farmers to feed the people. And I can\nfarm anything from chemicals to naturals, in hard rock or muddy water.\"\nHe paused and clamped his jaws together and said proudly, \"My father\nwas a farmer, and his father before him. One of the first to put a plow\ninto Venusian topsoil!\"\n\n\"Yes--uh--of course, Mr. Logan,\" mumbled Roger. \"I don't think\nthere'll--er--be any trouble about it.\"\n\nThe young cadet hadn't heard a word Hyram Logan had said, but instead\nhad been gazing happily into the eyes of Jane Logan. He stamped the\napplication and indicated the door to Tom's screening room, following\nthe girl wistfully with his eyes. He muttered to himself, \"There ought\nto be more applicants like Farmer Logan and his daughter for the brave\nnew world of Roald!\"\n\n\"And if there were, Cadet Manning,\" roared Captain Strong, standing in\nthe doorway from the hall, \"we'd probably wind up with a satellite\nfilled with beautiful women!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir! Er--no, sir,\" stuttered Roger, jerking himself to attention.\n\"I mean, what's wrong with that?\"\n\n\"By the rings of Saturn,\" declared Strong, \"you'll never change,\nManning!\"\n\nRoger grinned. \"I hope not, sir.\"\n\nThe door to Tom's room opened and the curly-haired cadet walked in\nholding an application.\n\n\"Captain Strong,\" he said, \"could I see you a minute?\"\n\n\"Sure, Tom. Any trouble?\" asked Strong.\n\nTom handed him the application silently and waited. Strong read the\nsheet and turned to Tom. \"You know what to do in a case like this, Tom.\nWhy come to me?\"\n\nTom screwed up his face, thinking. \"I don't know, sir. There's something\ndifferent about this fellow. Astro passed him with flying colors. Said\nhe knew as much about a reactor unit as he did. Roger passed him too.\"\n\n\"Who is it?\" asked Roger. Strong handed him the paper.\n\n\"Sure, I passed him,\" said Roger. \"That guy really knows his\nelectronics.\"\n\nStrong looked at Tom. \"How do you feel about it, Tom?\"\n\n\"Well, sir,\" began Tom, \"I would pass him in a minute. He's had\nexperience handling men and he's been in deep space before. He's logged\nan awful lot of time on merchant spaceships, but--\"\n\n\"But what?\" asked Strong. He took the paper and studied it again. \"Looks\nto me as if he's what we're looking for,\" he said.\n\n\"I know, sir,\" said Tom. \"But why would a man like that, with all that\nexperience, want to bury himself on Roald? He could get practically any\njob he wants, right here in the system.\"\n\n\"Ummh,\" mused Strong. He reread the application. In the blank space for\nreason for going, the applicant had written simply: _Adventure._ He\nhanded the application back to Tom. \"I think I see what you mean, Tom.\nIt does look too good. Better not take a chance. Seven years is a long\ntime to get stuck with a misfit, or worse, a--\" He didn't finish, but\nTom knew he meant a man not to be trusted.\n\n\"Tell Paul Vidac his application has been rejected,\" said Strong.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\n\n\"You mean Captain Strong has been recalled to the Academy?\" gasped\nRoger.\n\n\"That's right,\" replied Tom. \"He had a talk with Governor Hardy last\nnight and this morning he took the jet liner back to Earth. Special\norders from Commander Walters.\"\n\n\"Well, blast my jets!\" exclaimed Astro. \"Wonder what's up?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Tom. \"But it must be something more important than\nthe Roald project for him to pull out now!\"\n\n\"It might have something to do with the project, Tom,\" suggested Roger.\n\nTom shook his head. \"Maybe, but it just isn't like Captain Strong not to\nsay anything to us before he left. I wouldn't have known about it if one\nof the enlisted guardsmen hadn't asked me if we were going with him.\"\n\nAstro and Roger looked at each other. \"You mean,\" asked Roger, \"Captain\nStrong didn't tell you he was going?\"\n\n\"That's just it!\" replied Tom. \"We've been traveling all over space\ntogether screening the applicants, and then Captain Strong just leaves\nwhen we start the final screening.\"\n\nThe three cadets were seated in a snack shop in Luna City on the Moon,\nsipping hot tea and eating spaceburgers. For six weeks they had been\ninterviewing the applicants for the new satellite colony and were\ngetting near the end. Their task had gone fairly smoothly except for\nsome difficulty on Mars when Strong and the cadets had rejected scores\nof applicants with shady backgrounds; criminals and gamblers; spacemen\nwho had had their space papers picked up for violation of the space\ncode, and men who had been dismissed from the enlisted Solar Guard for\nserious misconduct. But now, finally, the quotas of all the colonies and\nplanets but Luna City on the Moon had been filled. Soon the expedition\nwould blast off for Roald.\n\n\"Well,\" said Tom, sipping the last of his tea, \"we have a heavy day\nahead of us tomorrow. I guess we'd better get back to the _Polaris_ and\nsack in.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" agreed Astro, tossing some credits on the counter and following\nTom and Roger out into the street. They walked past the shops, their\nblue cadet uniforms reflecting the garish colors of the nuanium signs in\nthe shop windows. At the first corner they hailed a jet cab and were\nsoon speeding out of the city toward the municipal spaceport.\n\nThe boys didn't talk much on the way out, each wondering why Captain\nStrong was recalled on such short notice, and why he had left without\nsaying good-by to them. They knew they would see him in a few days when\nthe processing of the Luna City applicants was over and they would\nreturn to Space Academy, but the relationship between the cadets and the\nSolar Guard captain had developed into a deeper association than just a\ncadet crew and officer supervisor. They were friends--spacemates! And\nthe boys sensed trouble ahead when they arrived at the Luna City\nspaceport. They stood in the shadow of the _Polaris_ and stared into the\nsky to watch the globe that was Earth revolve in the depths of space.\nThe outline of the Western Hemisphere, flanked by the shimmering\nAtlantic and Pacific oceans, could be seen clearly. It was a\nbreath-taking view of a world that had given birth to all the men who\nnow took the travel from one world to another for granted.\n\n\"Gosh,\" said Tom, staring at the magnificent sight. \"I see the Earth\nlike that every time we blast off from Luna. I should be used to it by\nnow, but--\" he stopped suddenly and sighed.\n\n\"I know what you mean, Tom,\" said Astro. \"It's the same with me. Gets me\nright here,\" and he put his hand to his heart.\n\n\"You don't know your anatomy yet, pal,\" drawled Roger. \"Move your hand\ndown a couple of inches. Things only get you in the stomach.\"\n\n\"Oh, is that a fact?\" growled the big Venusian. Suddenly, without any\napparent effort, he picked up the blond cadet and held him high in the\nair. \"Which way shall I drop him, Tom? On his head or the seat of his\npants? Seems to me it won't make much difference.\"\n\nTom laughed at the spectacle of Roger flailing the air helplessly, then\nsuddenly stopped and grabbed Astro by the arm. \"Wait, Astro,\" he called.\n\"Look! There's someone in the ship!\"\n\n\"What?\" cried Astro, dropping Roger and turning to the _Polaris_. The\nthree cadets saw light gleaming from the control-deck viewport.\n\n\"Well, I'll be a space monkey!\" exclaimed Roger. \"Who could it be?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" replied Tom. \"Governor Hardy is at the Luna City Hotel,\nand Captain Strong is the only one besides us who has the light key to\nopen the air lock!\"\n\n\"Well, what're we waiting for!\" said Roger. \"Let's find out what's going\non!\"\n\nThe three cadets climbed into the ship and raced up the companionway to\nthe control deck.\n\n\"No one here,\" announced Roger as he stepped through the hatch. He\nturned to Astro. \"You were the last one out of the ship. Are you sure\nyou locked it up?\"\n\n\"The ship was locked, Cadet Manning!\" said a voice in back of them. The\nthree cadets whirled around to face a tall, wiry man with dark hair,\ndressed in civilian clothes and holding a cup of coffee. He smiled at\nthe three startled cadets and casually drained the cup. \"I opened her,\"\nhe continued in a deep voice. \"Governor Hardy gave me the key.\"\n\n\"Who are you?\" asked Tom, almost indignant at the man's self-assurance.\nAnd then he stopped, frowning, \"Say, haven't I seen you before?\"\n\n\"You're right, Tom,\" cried Astro. \"I've seen him too!\"\n\n\"Who are you, mister?\" demanded Roger.\n\nThe man turned back to the messroom just off the control deck, put the\ncoffee cup down on the table, and returned to face the three cadets. \"My\nname is Paul Vidac. I'm the new lieutenant governor of Roald.\"\n\n\"You're what?\" gasped Tom.\n\n\"You're space happy!\" exclaimed Roger. \"Your application was refused.\nCaptain Strong rejected it himself.\"\n\n\"Fortunately for the project of Roald,\" said Vidac with a half-smile\nplaying at his lips, \"Captain Strong has been taken off the Roald\nproject.\" He paused and lounged against the bulkhead to announce, \"I\nhave replaced him.\"\n\n\"You couldn't replace Captain Strong digging a hole in the ground,\nmister!\" snapped Roger sarcastically.\n\n\"You might have taken over his work, but you couldn't touch him with an\natomic blaster,\" growled Astro. \"Captain Strong is--\"\n\n\"Wait, fellows,\" said Tom. \"Let's find out what this is all about.\"\n\n\"That's all right, Corbett,\" Vidac broke in. \"I appreciate your\nallegiance. I wouldn't like anyone who would accept another person in\nplace of a friend without putting up a beef.\" His voice was as smooth as\nthe purr of a cat.\n\n\"How could you have replaced him, mister?\" asked Tom, with just a little\nmore self-control than Roger or Astro had shown.\n\n\"Very simple,\" said Vidac. \"Governor Hardy has the final say on all\napplications, as you know. He has unquestioned authority to appoint,\napprove, and select anyone he wants. In view of my experience, Governor\nHardy was delighted to have me join the Roald expedition.\"\n\nThe three cadets looked at each other in bewilderment. Finally Tom\nwalked over and stuck out his hand. \"We're glad to have you aboard,\nsir.\" He managed a smile.\n\nReluctantly Roger and Astro followed suit.\n\n\"Thank you, boys,\" said Vidac with a smile. \"I'm sure we'll learn to\nwork together smoothly in these last few days. There are a few changes\nto be made of course. But it really doesn't matter. You'll be finished\nwith the screening soon.\"\n\n\"What kind of changes, sir?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"Oh, just routine,\" answered Vidac. \"Instead of you seeing the\napplicants first, I will speak with each one briefly before sending them\non to you.\"\n\n\"What's the matter with the way we've been doing it?\" asked Roger with\na slight edge to his voice that did not go unnoticed. Vidac looked at\nthe cadet. His mouth was smiling, but his eyes were hard.\n\n\"I think, Cadet Manning,\" purred Vidac, \"that it will be better for you\nnot to question me, or any of my practices. A Space Cadet's first rule\nis to take orders, _not_ to question them.\"\n\nTom was thinking quickly. It was obvious that Vidac had gone straight to\nGovernor Hardy and had prevailed on him to review his application. Tom\ncould see how Vidac's background would impress the governor. He\nremembered that there wasn't any real evidence against Vidac. In fact,\nTom thought, it was only because Vidac's background was so superior to\nmost of the applicants that he had aroused suspicion at all. Now, with\nCaptain Strong recalled to the Academy, it was only natural for the\ngovernor to get the best man for the job. Tom was ready to admit that\nVidac's background certainly spoke for itself.\n\nHe looked at the man and grinned. \"I'll tell you honestly, sir. When\nCaptain Strong refused your application, it was because--well--\"\n\nVidac was watching Tom shrewdly. \"Well?\" he asked quietly.\n\n\"It was because we couldn't understand how a man like you would want to\nbury yourself on a satellite for seven years when you could get most any\nkind of job you would want, right here in the Alliance.\"\n\nVidac hesitated just a second, and then his face broke into a broad\ngrin. \"You know, Corbett, you're right! Absolutely right! I can see\nwhere you three boys have done a fine job for the governor.\" He slapped\nAstro on the back and threw his arm around Tom's shoulder, speaking to\nthem in a suddenly confidential tone. \"As a matter of fact, I was\noffered the directorship of the Galactic space lanes only last week,\"\nhe said. \"Do you know why I refused it?\"\n\nTom shook his head.\n\n\"Because I'm a spaceman, just like yourselves.\" He looked at Astro.\n\"Cadet Astro, would you take a job with an outfit and give up space to\nsit behind a desk eight hours a day?\"\n\n\"No, sir!\" said Astro emphatically.\n\n\"Well, that's exactly the way I feel. But I commend you on your\nobservations about me, Corbett. I think I would have been a little\nsuspicious myself.\"\n\nThe three cadets smiled.\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said Tom. \"And forget what we just said. If Governor\nHardy's okayed you, that's good enough for us.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Corbett,\" said Vidac. \"I appreciate that.\"\n\n\"I guess we'd better turn in now,\" said Roger. \"We have a hard day ahead\nof us. Those applicants come at you like dinosaurs.\"\n\n\"Right!\" said Vidac. \"I'll take over Captain Strong's quarters. See you\nin the morning.\"\n\nThe three cadets went to their quarters without saying a word. When the\nhatch was closed, Roger turned and faced his unit mates.\n\n\"Well, it sure looks like we made a mistake about that spaceman!\" he\nsaid. \"I think he's all right!\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Astro, \"you can't blame a guy for not wanting to take a\ndesk job.\"\n\nTom merely sat in his bunk, starting to pull off one of his soft leather\nspace boots. He held it a moment, thinking, and then looked up at his\ntwo unit mates. \"You know, I think I'm going to have a talk with the\ngovernor.\"\n\n\"About what?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"Vidac,\" said Tom simply.\n\n\"What could you say that he doesn't already know?\" asked Astro.\n\n\"Why--\" Tom stopped. After a moment he dropped his boot to the deck,\nlooked up at Roger and Astro, and smiled. \"Nothing, I guess.\"\n\n\"Come on,\" said Roger, yawning. \"Let's turn in. Just the thought of\nfacing those applicants tomorrow makes me tired.\"\n\nAstro turned out the light and hopped into bed. Tom lay in his bunk,\nhands under his head, wondering about Vidac, and then he began to think\nabout the colony of Roald. He lay a long time, thinking about the fine\npeople who were giving up comfortable homes, successful businesses. He\nthought of Hyram Logan and family; the shopkeeper from Titan with three\nsets of twin boys; the Martian miner who had spent twenty-five futile\nyears searching for uranium in the asteroid belt. They were all ready to\ngo over fifty billion miles into deep space and begin their lives again.\nTom shook his head. He wondered if he had a choice whether he would\nchance the mystery and danger of deep space.\n\nWith the steady hum of the electronic generator on the power deck\ndroning in his ears the curly-haired cadet soon fell asleep.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"What did you say your name was?\" asked Roger of the applicant standing\nbefore him. He was a man badly in need of a shave and his clothes looked\nas if he had slept in them. He was the sixty-sixth applicant Roger had\nseen that morning.\n\n\"Tad Winters,\" replied the man in a surly tone, \"and hurry up with this\nbusiness. I haven't got all day!\"\n\nRoger looked up sharply. \"You'll wait until I've had time to check your\napplication, sir. Or you can leave right now!\"\n\n\"Listen, punk,\" snarled Winters, \"I just saw your boss--\"\n\n\"My boss?\" asked Roger, puzzled.\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Winters. \"Your boss, Vidac! And he said I was to tell you\nto pass me!\"\n\nRoger stood up and looked the man in the eye. \"You've had your space\npapers suspended twice, Mr. Winters. Once for smuggling, and once for\ninsubordination on a deep-space merchantman. Your application to go to\nRoald is rejected.\"\n\n\"We'll see about that!\" growled Winters. \"Gimme that, you space jerk!\"\nHe snatched the application out of Roger's hand and stomped out of the\nroom.\n\nRoger smiled. It was nothing new to him for the applicants to threaten\nhim and seek higher authority. He buzzed for the next applicant.\n\nMeanwhile, Tom was interviewing a small man with heavy eyebrows and a\nthin face. One side of his mouth twitched continually, making the man\nlook as though he were laughing. Tom read over the application and\nlooked up quickly.\n\n\"Mr. Bush,\" said Tom, \"you've stated here that you were once a messenger\nfor the Spaceways Bonded Messenger Service and that you were dismissed.\nWhy was that?\"\n\nEd Bush's mouth twitched as he played with his hat and stirred uneasily\nin his chair. \"I was framed,\" he said finally.\n\n\"Framed?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"Yeah, framed!\" snapped Bush. \"I was taking a credit pouch to Venusport\nfrom Atom City when it was stolen from me.\"\n\n\"Could you prove it?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"How could I prove it when I don't know what happened to it?\" growled\nBush. \"Listen, Corbett, you can't hold a little thing like that against\nme. A man is entitled to one mistake--\"\n\nTom held up his hand. \"Mr. Bush, you also had your space papers\nsuspended for six months and were caught during the suspension blasting\noff with false papers. Was that a mistake?\"\n\n\"Well, what do you expect a man to do? Go hungry? I've been a spaceman\nlonger than you've been alive. I had to have a job. There wasn't\nanything else I could do.\" His voice trailed off into a whine.\n\n\"But you did, willfully and with full knowledge of your act, violate the\nspace code by using false papers, didn't you?\" pursued Tom.\n\n\"Yeah, but--\" whined Bush.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" said Tom, standing up. \"Your application has been\nrejected.\"\n\nBush stood up and snatched the application from Tom. His mouth began to\ntwitch furiously. \"Why, you little--\"\n\n\"That's enough, Bush!\" snapped Vidac, who had suddenly entered the room.\n\"Leave your application on the desk and get out!\"\n\nBush turned and looked at Vidac, nodded, and glared at Tom before\nstalking from the room. Vidac smiled at Tom's questioning look and\nwalked over. He sat on the edge of Tom's desk and picked up Bush's\napplication.\n\n\"Funny thing about Bush, Tom,\" Vidac mused.\n\n\"What, sir?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"Notice the nervous twitch he has on the side of his face?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Tom.\n\n\"I've known Bush a long time. Many years. He used to be the happiest\nlittle space joker in the system, singing all the time, playing a\nconcertina. And then he lost that credit pouch. It bothered him real\nbad.\"\n\n\"I guess it would, sir,\" said Tom.\n\n\"And then he got caught blasting off with false papers and of course\nthat made him a marked man. He developed the nervous twitch right after\nthat. He's a good man, Tom. And I think we ought to give him another\nchance.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nTom gasped. \"But, sir, he's broken the space code!\"\n\nVidac looked at Tom and smiled. \"I know, Tom, and it's a serious thing.\nBut I think he deserves another chance.\"\n\n\"We've refused people for a lot less than that, sir,\" said Tom\nemphatically, \"before you came.\"\n\nVidac's face hardened. \"I said we were going to give him another\nchance!\"\n\nTom met the lieutenant governor's eyes coolly. \"Yes, sir.\" He stamped\nthe application and handed it to Vidac.\n\n\"It's pretty easy to sit in judgment of others, Tom,\" said Vidac,\nsmiling again. \"If there are any more--ah--questionable applicants, I\nsuggest you send them to me. And if I want to give them another chance,\nyou will, of course, follow orders.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir,\" replied Tom, tight-lipped. \"If you say so.\"\n\nVidac's eyes hardened. \"_I say so_, Corbett!\" He turned and walked from\nthe room.\n\nTom sat down weakly. As he was about to buzz for the next applicant, the\ndoor burst open and Roger came into the room. The blond-haired cadet's\nlips were pulled tight in a grim line.\n\n\"There's something rocket-blasting screwy around here, Tom!\" he\nexclaimed.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"I just rejected a real low-down space crawler--a guy named Tad\nWinters.\"\n\n\"Yes?\" Tom was alert, anticipating Roger's answer.\n\n\"He went to Vidac and came back later with his application approved.\"\n\nTom slammed his fist on the desk. \"That proves it! Governor Hardy has to\nbe told what's going on!\" He flipped on the teleceiver near by and asked\nthe central communications operator to connect him with the governor's\noffice. In a moment the face of Christopher Hardy sharpened into focus\non the screen.\n\n\"What is it, Corbett?\" asked the governor.\n\n\"I'd like to talk to you, sir, if I may. Something's just come up and\nI'm not sure what to do.\"\n\n\"Well, whatever it is, I'm sure Governor Vidac will be able to take care\nof it. Speak to him.\"\n\nTom gulped and glanced at Roger. \"But, sir,\" he stammered,\n\"it's--it's--\"\n\n\"It's what, Corbett? Hurry, lad! I haven't got all day.\"\n\n\"What I have to say is--is--about the lieutenant governor, sir,\" Tom\nmanaged finally.\n\n\"Now listen, son,\" said Hardy, \"I have a lot of confidence in you three\nboys. You've all done a fine job. But I screened Mr. Vidac myself, and\nI'm satisfied that he is just the man I need. After Captain Strong was\nrecalled to the Academy, I had to have a man to take over for him. And I\nam satisfied that Mr. Vidac is about as fine a man as I could get! Now\ndon't bother me again. You've done a fine job, as I said. But don't let\nit go to your heads!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Tom, clamping his teeth together. \"Very well, sir!\"\n\n\"One more thing,\" said Hardy. \"We've about finished here at Luna City.\nWhen you've processed the last of the applicants, prepare the _Polaris_\nfor a return trip to Space Academy.\" He paused and smiled. \"I think I\nmight be able to convince Commander Walters you need a two weeks'\nleave!\" He smiled again and then his face disappeared from the screen.\n\nTom looked up at Roger. \"I don't like it, Roger. Maybe I'm wrong, but\neither the governor is pretty dumb or Vidac is the slickest thing in\nspace!\"\n\n\"Could be both,\" drawled Roger.\n\nTom looked at the pile of applications on his desk, and then at the door\nto Vidac's office.\n\n\"Whatever it is, we've got to tell Captain Strong!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5\n\n\n\"For the last time, Captain Strong has been sent on a special mission to\nPluto!\" said the supervisory officer at the Academy. \"Now stop bothering\nme or I'll log all three of you with twenty galley demerits!\"\n\n\"Very well, sir,\" said Tom. \"But could you tell us if the mission had\nanything to do with the Roald project?\"\n\n\"Cadet Corbett,\" replied the officer wearily, \"even if I knew I couldn't\ntell you. It was a special order from Commander Walters' office. Captain\nStrong blasted off three days ago with a full crew of guardsmen in a\nrocket cruiser.\"\n\n\"And he didn't--\" began Roger.\n\n\"And he didn't leave any message for you,\" concluded the officer.\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said Tom. \"Come on, fellows, let's go. We've got to\nblast off for Mars in half an hour and we haven't got our gear packed.\"\n\nThe officer watched the three cadets leave and then called after them.\n\"If Captain Strong returns before you get back from Mars, Corbett, I'll\nask him to leave a message!\"\n\n\"Thanks, sir,\" said Tom.\n\nThe three boys left the Tower building and hopped on a slidewalk for\nthe spaceport. The Academy was buzzing with activity as Solar Guard\nofficers, scientists, and enlisted men attended to the millions of\ndetails of the mass flight of the colonists into deep space.\n\nThey met Mike McKenny, the stubby warrant officer, at the air lock of\nthe Solar Guard rocket destroyer that would take them to Mars. After\nthey had climbed into the ship, they waited for a full hour before they\ncould get clearance to blast off. And, in flight, they were forced to\nmaintain constant alert and careful position in the heavy flow of\ntraffic to and from Earth.\n\n\"Never saw the Academy so busy in all my life,\" commented Mike. \"Must be\na thousand ships there and in the Atom City fitting docks.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" agreed Roger. \"This is going to be some push!\"\n\nFrom Mars, Titan, Ganymede, Luna City, Venus, the Asteroid Colonies, and\nas far away as the uranium mines of Pluto, the colonists arrived, to be\nquartered at Space Academy. Excited, and anxious to begin their new\nlife, they assembled for their antibiotic shots and the last medical\ncheck by the Solar Guard doctors. There were crystal miners from Titan,\nfarmers from Venus, Mars, and Earth, prospectors from the New Sahara\ndesert of Mars, engineers from the atmosphere booster stations on\nGanymede, and just plain citizens who wanted a new life on the distant\nsatellite of Wolf 359. All had gathered for the great mass flight into\nspace.\n\nAt the same time the giant fleet of ships needed to carry the colonists\nto Roald was being assembled. Officers of the Solar Guard worked late\ninto the night, examining the construction of every ship in the Alliance\nfor use in the flight to Roald. If a jet liner or merchantman was found\nto be satisfactory, it was purchased at full price from the owners and\nflown to refitting docks at Space Academy and Atom City where work was\nbegun converting it to a special use. Every ship was to be cannibalized\non Roald, its hull taken apart to provide housing and its power decks\nconverted into electropower plants. Now working with Mike McKenny, the\nthree Space Cadets were part of a large group of transfer crews engaged\nin flying ships to Earth.\n\n[Illustration: _The Solar Guard worked late into the night, examining\nevery ship in the Alliance_]\n\nReturning from Mars, where they had picked up a giant jet liner, the\nthree cadets landed on the crowded Academy spaceport and turned\nhopefully to Mike.\n\n\"You think we can get a twenty-four-hour pass, Mike?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"Yeah,\" growled Astro. \"Governor Hardy promised us a two-week leave, but\nI guess he got swamped under details!\"\n\nMike scratched his head. \"I don't know, boys,\" he said. \"I can't give it\nto you, but I'll speak to Commander Walters for you. I know it's been a\npretty rough grind for all of you.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Mike,\" said Tom. \"We'd appreciate it.\"\n\nLater, when the three boys had signed over the giant ship to the\nrefitting crews, they headed for their dormitory for a refreshing\nshower.\n\nAs Astro began to strip off his jacket, he suddenly asked, \"Do you think\nCaptain Strong has returned from Pluto yet?\"\n\n\"I doubt it,\" answered Roger. \"I'm sure there would have been a message\nfor us on the chatter wire if he had.\" Roger referred to a tape recorder\nthat was standard equipment in each of the dormitory rooms, used\nexpressly for messages.\n\n\"You know something,\" said Tom. \"I think we ought to go directly to\nCommander Walters about Vidac.\"\n\n\"Commander Walters!\" growled Astro. \"Are you off your rocket?\"\n\n\"Why shouldn't we?\" agreed Roger.\n\n\"I'll tell you why!\" said Astro. \"Commander Walters probably is so busy\nyou couldn't get near him with a six-inch atomic blaster. And what are\nwe going to say after we get there? Just that Vidac has let some space\ncrawlers into the expedition?\"\n\n\"That's enough, isn't it?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"We can't let this slide, Astro,\" said Tom determinedly. \"Somebody's got\nto do something about Vidac, and if the governor won't, it should be\nbrought to Commander Walters' attention.\"\n\n\"Come on. Let's do it right now,\" urged Roger. \"We'll be sticking our\nnecks out, but since when have we ever let that stop us?\"\n\nAstro shrugged his shoulders and quickly redressed. The three boys left\nthe dormitory building and started hopping from one slidewalk to\nanother, as they made their way to the Tower building. All around them\nthe activity of the Academy seemed to have increased. Everyone seemed to\nbe rushing somewhere. Even the green-clad Earthworm cadets had been\npressed into service as messengers. And mixed in with the officials were\nthe colonists wandering around sight-seeing.\n\n\"Say!\" exclaimed Astro. \"Isn't that Jane Logan?\"\n\n\"Where?\" asked Roger. Astro pointed to a parallel slidewalk where the\ngirl colonist from Venus was being whisked along in the same direction.\n\"Well, blast my jets!\" cried Roger. \"So it is!\"\n\n\"Relax, Roger,\" said Astro with a wink at Tom. \"Business before\npleasure!\"\n\n\"Yeah--yeah, but this is business too,\" said Roger, jumping lightly to\nthe near-by slidewalk beside the pretty young colonist.\n\n\"Well,\" he exclaimed, \"if it isn't the little space doll from Venus!\"\n\nJane Logan turned around and smiled. \"Well, Cadet Manning!\" And seeing\nAstro and Tom come up, she smiled a greeting to them. \"And Cadets Astro\nand Corbett!\"\n\n\"Never mind them,\" said Roger. \"I'm the only one that counts.\"\n\n\"Why, Cadet Manning,\" said the girl archly, \"I had no idea you were so\nimportant.\"\n\n\"As a matter of fact, I'm going up to see Commander Walters right now on\nsome important business.\"\n\n\"Commander Walters?\" gasped Jane. \"Ohhhh!\"\n\nRoger grinned. \"Sure, and while I'm up there, I'll get a\ntwenty-four-hour pass and we'll take in the sights at Atom City tonight.\nO.K.?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know what my father would say about that!\"\n\n\"Ah, tell him you're going to go out with me,\" said Roger, \"and there\nwon't be any trouble.\"\n\n\"Psst! Roger!\" Astro hissed suddenly, punching Roger in the ribs. Roger\ngave the big cadet a frowning look and turned back to Jane.\n\n\"We'll have dinner, and then see a stereo, and I know a nice quiet spot\nwhere we can talk--\"\n\n\"Talk?\" demanded a gruff voice behind Roger.\n\nThe cadet whirled to find himself staring into the grim face of Hyram\nLogan. \"Just what would you talk about, Cadet Manning?\" demanded Jane's\nfather. Billy stood at his father's side, grinning broadly.\n\n\"Uh--er--ah--radar, sir, the--er--problems we find in radar.\"\n\nLogan turned to Jane. \"Are you interested in radar, Jane?\"\n\n\"Not particularly, Father,\" said Jane, a twinkle in her eye. Tom and\nAstro were trying unsuccessfully to stifle their laughter.\n\nHis face suddenly flushing crimson, Roger looked around and stammered,\n\"I--uh--I just remembered--got to see a feller about a hot rocket!\" And\nRoger jumped off the slidewalk to disappear into the Tower building.\n\nLaughing out loud now, Tom and Astro said good-by to Jane and her father\nand followed Roger.\n\nInside the gleaming Tower of Galileo, the two boys raced up the\nslidestairs and caught up with Roger.\n\n\"Well, Romeo,\" said Astro, slapping him on the back, \"that was what I\ncall a strategic retreat in the face of overwhelming odds.\"\n\n\"Ah, go blast your jets!\" snarled Roger.\n\n\"Never mind, Roger,\" said Tom, \"we probably won't get the pass, anyway.\"\n\nSuppressing smiles, Astro and Tom followed Roger down the long corridor\ntoward the office of Commander Walters. In the anteroom they waited\nwhile an aide announced them to the commander. Standing before the\naide's desk, they could see the commander's face come into focus on the\nsmall teleceiver screen, and they were alarmed to see Governor Hardy\nseated beside him.\n\n\"What is it, Sergeant?\" asked Commander Walters.\n\n\"Cadets Corbett, Manning, and Astro of the _Polaris_ unit to see you,\nsir,\" said the enlisted guardsman.\n\n\"Send them right in,\" said Walters.\n\nThe aide flipped off the teleceiver and smiled up at the cadets. \"Go\nahead, fellows. He's in a good mood today, so you don't have to worry\nabout demerits.\"\n\nTom thanked the guardsman and started for the door to the inner office,\nbut Roger grabbed him by the arm and pulled him back.\n\n\"We can't go in there now, Tom,\" he whispered. \"Not with Governor Hardy\nsitting there!\"\n\n\"I know,\" replied Tom. \"But we can't back out now. He's been told we're\nhere. We'll just go in and ask him for the week-end pass.\"\n\n\"Good idea,\" agreed Astro.\n\n\"Say, are you guys going in or not?\" called the sergeant.\n\nThe three cadets nodded quickly and stepped inside the room. Governor\nHardy and the commander were studying a blueprint which was spread out\non the desk. The three cadets came to attention in front of the desk as\nWalters looked up inquiringly.\n\n\"_Polaris_ unit reporting on a special privilege request, sir,\"\nannounced Tom.\n\nWalters smiled. \"Yes, I know why you're here, boys. Warrant Officer\nMcKenny spoke to me a little while ago. Here's your pass. After the job\nyou've done, you deserve it.\" He held out the slip of paper.\n\nGovernor Hardy stood up and snapped his fingers. \"You know, Commander, I\nowe these boys an apology. When we left Luna City, I promised them that\nI would speak to you about giving them a two-weeks' leave, and it\ncompletely slipped my mind!\"\n\n\"It's a good thing it did,\" said Walters. \"I've had these boys doing\nsome important work and I'll have even more need for them now. Come\nhere, boys. I want you to look at something.\" He waved them around his\ndesk and pointed to the blueprint on his desk. Tom, Roger, and Astro\ngasped. It was the plan for a large city.\n\n\"That will be the first settlement on Roald,\" said Walters. \"You boys\nwill be remembered for a long time to come.\" He looked up at the\ngovernor and winked.\n\n\"How is that, sir?\" asked Tom.\n\nWalters placed his finger on the many intersecting lines in the\nblueprint that designated streets. \"Each of these streets, avenues,\nroads, and expressways will be named after a member of the first\ncolonial expedition to Roald. Your names will be among them.\"\n\n\"Ours!\" exclaimed Tom. \"Does that mean that--\"\n\n\"I've been talking to Governor Hardy,\" Walters continued casually. \"He\ntells me you've done a fine job. I think a tour of duty as cadet\nobservers on Roald will just about round out your training.\"\n\nThe three boys looked at each other, eyes wide with surprise and\npleasure.\n\n\"We'll actually go with the colonists?\" asked Astro.\n\n\"That's right, Cadet Astro,\" said Walters. \"And I'm sorry that I can't\ngive you more than a twenty-four-hour pass. But time is very short.\"\n\n\"Twenty-four hours will be fine, sir,\" said Tom. \"And we appreciate your\ngiving us the opportunity to go to Roald.\"\n\n\"It won't be easy, Corbett,\" cautioned Walters. \"You'll have to work\nharder than you've worked before. You'll have to maintain your studies\nand I'll expect you to send back a report every month.\" He turned to\nGovernor Hardy. \"Do you have anything to add, sir?\"\n\n\"Not a thing, Commander,\" replied Hardy. \"I've worked with these boys\nfor weeks and I know what to expect of them. I know I can depend on them\nto take orders.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Walters, turning to the cadets. \"Go to Atom City and\nhave yourself a good time. Report back to the Academy tomorrow at\neighteen hundred hours. Unit dismissed!\"\n\nThe three cadets saluted and left the room. In the corridor they slumped\nagainst the wall.\n\n\"That,\" announced Roger, \"is as close as I ever want to come to getting\na rocket shell in the side of the head.\"\n\n\"You can say that again, spaceboy,\" sighed Astro.\n\n\"Just think what would have happened if we'd opened our mouths about\nVidac!\"\n\n\"Come on,\" said Tom. \"We've got twenty-four hours to soak up as much of\nthis Earth as we can. And I, for one, am going to have a good time!\"\n\nWithout a word, the three cadets left the Tower building and made their\nway to the monorail station, where they would catch the streamlined\nexpress to Atom City. Each of the cadets was acutely aware of the\ntrouble that lay ahead of them, and with Captain Strong at the outer\nedge of the solar system on a long haul to Pluto, not even a miracle\ncould get him back to Space Academy in time to help them.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6\n\n\nA thousand spaceships, freighters, converted luxury liners, auxiliary\nsupply vessels, rocket cruisers, destroyers and scouts, all led by the\n_Polaris_, blasted in even formation through the last charted regions of\nthe solar system. Inside the gleaming ships the colonists had settled\ndown for the long voyage to the new satellite of Roald. Their quarters\nwere cramped and uncomfortable. There was very little to do and their\nonly entertainment was the shipboard stereos. Many spent endless hours\nat the long-range telescanners watching the sun star Wolf 359, seeing it\ncome closer and closer.\n\nAboard the _Polaris_, Tom, Roger, and Astro worked an endless tour of\nduty, maneuvering the great fleet of ships into ordered formation so\nthat any vessel could be found without difficulty. Now that the fleet\nwas in position, and the early confusion of forming up was over, they\nhad hoped for a little rest, but were disappointed when Vidac suddenly\nordered them to report to his quarters.\n\nStanding at the hatch outside of Vidac's room, Tom and Roger waited for\nAstro as he climbed up the ladder to join them. The big cadet finally\nmade the top and stood breathing heavily.\n\n\"By the rings of Saturn,\" he grumbled, \"I'm so tired I could sleep right\nhere. Right now!\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" growled Roger. \"You'd think Vidac would give us a break after\nwhat we've done.\"\n\n\"We'll have plenty of time to rest on this trip,\" said Tom. \"This is\njust the beginning. I'll bet by the time we reach Roald we'll be wishing\nwe had something to do to pass away the time.\"\n\nHe turned and pressed the annunciator button and the hatch slid open.\nThe three cadets entered the room and snapped to attention.\n\n\"_Polaris_ unit reporting as ordered, sir,\" said Tom.\n\nVidac swung around in his chair and stared up at the three cadets, a\nhint of a smile curling his lips.\n\n\"You've done a fine job, boys,\" he said. \"The fleet is in good\nformation.\" He paused as he settled back in his chair. \"But I'm not the\none who believes in idle hands. I've assigned you to Professor Sykes. He\nneeds help in charting the unexplored regions of space we're\napproaching. And you three need that kind of training. Report to him in\none hour.\"\n\n\"One hour,\" gasped Roger. \"But we're completely blasted out!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" agreed Astro. \"Couldn't we log some sack time before we\nstart another assignment?\"\n\nVidac stood up and faced them. \"You might as well learn right now,\" he\nsaid sharply, \"that when I give an order I expect it to be carried out\nwithout suggestions, complaints, or whining excuses!\"\n\n\"But--!\" stammered Roger.\n\nTom quickly stepped forward. His back ramrod straight, he saluted the\nlieutenant governor. \"We understand, sir.\"\n\nHe executed a perfect about-face and, followed by Astro and Roger, he\nleft the lieutenant governor's quarters.\n\nOutside, the three cadets walked wearily toward the messroom just off\nthe control deck. After preparing a hasty cup of tea, they sat about the\ntable silently, each thinking about the long trip ahead of them and the\ndifficulties they were sure to encounter with Vidac. They all three\njumped when Jeff Marshall, Professor Sykes's aide, entered and boomed a\ncheerful greeting.\n\n\"Hi, fellas!\"\n\n\"Hiya,\" muttered Tom. Astro and Roger merely nodded.\n\n\"Say!\" cried Jeff, his usually cheerful face showing concern. \"What's\nthe matter with you three guys? You look as though someone told you\nthere isn't any Moon!\"\n\n\"Worse than that,\" said Roger. \"Vidac just assigned us to work with\nProfessor Sykes on charting the new space regions.\"\n\nJeff smiled. \"Nothing wrong with that. The old professor isn't so bad.\nHe sounds worse than he really is.\"\n\n\"Listen,\" growled Astro, \"you don't have to tell me what Professor Sykes\nis like. I had a class with him at the Academy. That guy is so sour,\nvinegar is sweet by comparison.\"\n\nAstro's outburst was said with such fierce conviction that Tom, Roger,\nand Jeff burst out laughing.\n\n\"It isn't that we mind working with Professor Sykes,\" said Tom. \"He's a\nreal brain and we could learn a lot from him, but--\"\n\n\"But what?\" asked Jeff.\n\n\"It's the way Vidac has suddenly--well, taken over around here. We're\nsupposed to be under the direct orders of Governor Hardy.\"\n\n\"Well, Vidac is Hardy's executive officer,\" said Jeff.\n\n\"Yeah,\" muttered Roger. \"We're finding that out, the hard way.\"\n\n\"I still can't understand why Governor Hardy would make him lieutenant\ngovernor, with his background,\" mused Tom.\n\nJeff grinned. \"You three guys have been jockeying with so many space\ncrawlers since you came to the Academy, you're suspicious of everyone\nyou meet. I'm surprised you haven't decided that I'm an arch space\ncriminal myself!\"\n\nThe three cadets smiled. Jeff Marshall was so gentle and mild, his\nmanner so quietly humorous, it was impossible to picture him as any kind\nof a criminal.\n\nDuring the few minutes they had left, they casually discussed the\nchances of the senior space cadets against the enlisted guardsmen in a\nforthcoming mercuryball game, and then went up to the forward\ncompartment of the _Polaris_, which served as a temporary observatory\nfor Professor Sykes.\n\nThe Chief Astrophysicist of Space Academy, Professor Barnard Sykes, was\na man of great talent and even greater temper. Referred to as Barney by\nthe cadet corps, he was held in high regard and downright fear. There\nwere few cadets who had escaped his scathing tongue when they had made a\nmistake and practically the entire student body had, at one time or\nanother, singly and in unison, devoutly wished that a yawning hole would\nopen up and swallow them when he began one of his infamous tirades. Even\nperfection in studies and execution by a cadet would receive a mere\ngrunt from the cantankerous professor. Such temperament was permissible\nat the Academy by an instructor only because of his genius and for no\nother reason. And Professor Sykes fitted the bill. It was by sheer\ndevotion to his work and single-mindedness of purpose that he was able\nto become a leading scientist in his field. Professor Sykes had been\nassigned, at his request, to the Roald expedition. As the leading\nscientist, it was his job to evaluate every new discovery made during\nthe trip out to the distant satellite, and later make observations on\nthe colony itself. Scientifically, and in a sense ultimately, the\nsuccess or failure of the Roald expedition would rest on his round\nhunched shoulders.\n\nWhen the three cadets and Jeff Marshall entered the observatory, they\nfound Professor Sykes bending over a calculating machine checking some\nfigures. Apparently finding a mistake, he muttered to himself angrily\nand started over again. Roger stepped forward.\n\n\"I can handle a calculator pretty well, sir,\" Roger said. \"You want me\nto do it for you?\"\n\nSykes whirled around and glared at the blond-haired cadet. \"What's your\nname?\" he snapped.\n\n\"Why--Cadet Manning, sir,\" replied Roger.\n\n\"Cadet Manning, do you see this calculator?\" Sykes pointed to the\ndelicate instrument that could add, subtract, divide, and multiply, in\nfractions and whole numbers, as well as measure the light years in\nsidereal time.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Roger.\n\n\"Cadet Manning,\" continued Sykes, \"I perfected that machine. Built the\nfirst one myself. Now offhand, wouldn't you say I would know how to\noperate it?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" stammered Roger. \"But I just wanted to help, sir.\"\n\n\"When I need your help I'll ask for it!\" snorted the little professor.\nHe turned to Jeff. \"What are they doing here? You know I don't like to\nbe interrupted when I'm making observations!\"\n\nJeff smiled slowly. \"They've been assigned to work with you, sir.\nThey're your new assistants.\"\n\n\"My assistants!\" screamed Sykes. \"What space-blasting idiot got the idea\nthat I needed any assistants?\"\n\n\"The lieutenant governor, sir,\" said Jeff.\n\n\"Oh, he did, did he!\" Sykes turned to the teleceiver, flipped it on,\nand waited impatiently for the machine to warm up.\n\nIn a moment Vidac's face came into view. Before the lieutenant governor\ncould say a word, Sykes began to scream at him.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"What's the idea of sending these brainless Space Cadets to me!\nAssistants--bah! Can't you find something else for them to do?\" bawled\nSykes. \"Is my work considered so unimportant that I should be impeded by\nthese--these--\" He sputtered and turned to wave at Tom, Roger, and Astro\nwho still stood at rigid attention.\n\nSykes got no further. Vidac simply cut off his teleceiver and left the\nprofessor staring into a blank screen. His face became beet red, and he\nscreamed at Jeff Marshall. \"Get them out of here! Put them to\nwork--scrubbing the decks, cleaning up the place, anything! But keep\nthem out of my way!\" Then wagging a finger in Roger's face, he screamed\nhis last warning. \"Don't ever speak to me again, unless I speak to you\n_first!_\"\n\nSmarting under the continuous blast of anger from the professor, Roger\ncould no longer restrain himself. Slowly, with the calm deliberate\nmanner and slow casual drawl that characterized him at his sarcastic\nbest, the cadet stepped forward. He saluted, and with his face a bare\nsix inches from Sykes, said evenly, \"To speak to you, sir, under any\nconditions, sir, would be such a stroke of bad luck, sir, that I\nwouldn't wish it on the last spaceman in the world, sir.\" With another\ncurt salute he wheeled smartly and walked out of the room.\n\nFlabbergasted, Professor Sykes could manage no more than a hoarse\nbubbling sound and he finally turned to Jeff Marshall, waving his arms\nviolently. \"Get them out of here--get them out of here. Get them out!\"\n\nThe sergeant nodded quickly at Tom and Astro, who, repressing smiles,\nsaluted and followed Roger out of the observatory.\n\nWithin the hour, Professor Sykes was still screaming loudly, this time\nto Governor Hardy himself. Standing before his desk the eccentric\nscientist babbled his complaint of Vidac's rebuff and Roger's outrageous\ninsolence.\n\n\"I won't stand for it, Governor! My work is more important than having\nto wipe the noses of three loudmouthed sassy cadets! And as for\nthat--that man Vidac, if he ever turns off the teleceiver again when I'm\ntalking to him, I'll go to the Solar Council itself. I'm an officer of\nthe Solar Guard and demand respect!\"\n\nHis harangue concluded, Sykes turned and stalked toward the hatch.\n\n\"Just a moment,\" called Hardy, stepping around the desk to confront the\nlittle scientist. \"All of us are assigned to important jobs,\" he said\ncalmly. \"Yours is scientific research; the cadets have a specific job of\neducation; I am the co-ordinator of the whole project and Lieutenant\nGovernor Vidac is my immediate executive officer. We all have to work\ntogether. Let's see if we can't do it a little more smoothly, eh?\" Hardy\nsmiled and turned back to his chair. \"But one thing more, Sykes. If\nthere are any more petty disagreements, please settle them with Vidac.\nDon't come up here again, unless I order you to!\"\n\n\"_You_ order _me_,\" gasped Sykes.\n\n\"That's all, Sykes!\" said Hardy coldly, picking up some papers in an\nobvious gesture of dismissal. His fury redoubled, the professor backed\nout of the room and hurried below to Vidac's quarters. Expecting another\ncold interview, he was surprised when Vidac met him with a smile and\nasked him to enjoy a cup of coffee with him.\n\n\"No need for us to antagonize each other over the foolish mistakes and\nbunglings of the cadets, Professor,\" said Vidac evenly. \"I apologize for\ncutting you off, but I make it a point never to talk to a man when he's\nangry. Come, sit down, and have a cup of coffee. I'm sure we can work\nout the answer.\" He paused and then added pointedly, \"Without bothering\nGovernor Hardy.\"\n\n\"Yes--yes--of course,\" said Sykes, accepting the proffered cup.\n\nWithin a half-hour, Vidac had Sykes laughing at his jokes and stories,\nand when they parted, the professor's temper had abated. When the\nscientist finally left, Vidac turned to the ship's intercom and paged\nthe cadets. A few minutes later they entered his quarters for the second\ntime that evening.\n\nVidac was ready and waiting when they entered the room and came to\nattention. He leaned back against his desk and looked at each cadet\nthrough half-closed eyes. Finally, after a full minute of silence, he\nbegan to speak.\n\n\"I gave you specific instructions to report to Professor Sykes for work\nas his assistants,\" he said in a cold, hard voice. \"I also told you I\nwanted my order carried out without complaints or whining excuses. You\nsaw fit to start an argument as soon as you reported, thereby\ninterrupting his work. The professor went to the governor and\ninterrupted _his_ work. The professor came to see me, interrupting _my_\nwork. Three men had to stop their jobs because you didn't feel like\ncarrying out orders.\"\n\n\"But, sir--\" said Tom. \"The professor--\"\n\n\"Shut up, Corbett!\" said Vidac coldly. \"Don't ever interrupt me again\nwhile I'm talking!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\" said Tom through tight lips.\n\n\"You boys have been enjoying considerable latitude under Captain Strong.\nBut I would like to remind you that Captain Strong isn't here. There's\nno one here but me. You will do as I say, when I say it, and as long as\nI say it. If you don't, I promise you, you will regret it.\"\n\n\"May I speak, sir?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"No, Manning. I've heard about your tongue. I warn you, never use it on\nme, or--\" He paused. \"Just never use it, that's all.\"\n\nHe walked about the room, but kept his eyes on the cadets. \"There's just\none more thing I want you to understand, before you're dismissed. I know\nthat all three of you refused my application as a colonist originally. I\nknow what your feelings must be now that I am your superior. And because\nI know, I feel I should warn you not to try to express your feelings.\nYou can't win. You can only lose. If I ever catch you going to Governor\nHardy, by-passing my authority, I'll make your lives so miserable\nyou'll wish you were dead. Now get out of here!\"\n\nAs one man, the cadets of the _Polaris_ unit saluted, turned a perfect\nabout-face, and walked once again from the room. Outside in the\npassageway, they relaxed and headed for their quarters.\n\nNone of them could say a word, for the simple reason that each of them\nwas so boiling mad he couldn't speak. Finally, after they had showered\nand were climbing into their bunks, Tom spoke for the first time since\nleaving Vidac.\n\n\"I have to write a report to Captain Strong,\" he said, when Roger\nstarted to turn out the light. \"Better leave it on a while, Roger.\"\n\n\"O.K., Tom,\" said Roger. \"Are you going to tell him what's going on\nhere?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" growled Astro. \"Give him the whole works. There's something\nwrong here somewhere. I can understand the professor blasting his jets.\nHe does that all the time. But I can't understand Vidac acting the way\nhe does.\"\n\n\"I feel the same way, Astro,\" said Tom, \"but actually what are we going\nto say to Captain Strong? So far nothing concrete has happened.\" He\nshook his head. \"I'm afraid if I put what happened down on an\naudioscriber that it'll look as though we've suddenly become\ncry-babies!\"\n\n\"I'm ready to quit!\" said Roger. \"Grab a freighter and blast outta here.\nA whole year with this guy! There's no telling what he's liable to do!\"\n\nTom leaned over the table and stared at the bulkhead in front of him. He\nclenched his fists. Needless to say, he agreed with Roger, he had the\nsame feelings. But he was powerless to do anything about it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7\n\n\n\"All set, Tom,\" called Roger, adjusting the valves that supplied a\nsteady stream of oxygen into his space suit. Tom nodded and turned to\nAstro, seated behind them, his hand on the remote-control switch\ngoverning the huge air-lock portal on the jet-boat deck.\n\n\"Open her up, Astro,\" he ordered, his voice crackling through the\nspacephones inside his space helmet. Astro pressed the lever opening the\nsliding panel in the side of the hull of the _Polaris_ and the cold\nblackness of outer space came into view.\n\nSeated at the controls of the jet boat, Tom pressed down on the\nacceleration pedal, sending the tiny ship rocketing out of the _Polaris_\nlike a projectile. As they circled their mother ship, Roger pointed out\nthe vessel they were going to and Tom settled down to full throttle in\nthe direction of Roald colony vessel Number Twelve. The huge converted\nluxury liner carrying many of the colonists was several lanes away in\nthe sprawling formation of ships and it would take several minutes for\nthem to traverse the four hundred miles to Number Twelve.\n\nThe three cadets were under orders to tour the fleet and observe\nconditions aboard the other ships. It was obviously a nuisance\nassignment since any extraordinary conditions could have been reported\nby teleceiver. But they were glad to get away from Vidac and Professor\nSykes if only for a little while.\n\nHolding the small vessel at full throttle, Tom settled back and pointed\nout several of the large star clusters in the clear airless void of\nspace around them. Andromeda Galaxy whirled above them like a\nFourth-of-July pin wheel. And the sun stars of Regulus, Sirius, and the\nSeven Sisters sparkled like diamonds on black velvet.\n\n\"Think we'll ever reach those babies?\" mused Tom in a quiet voice.\n\n\"We're on the first step right now with this expedition,\" replied Astro.\n\n\"A short step,\" commented Roger. \"To us Wolf 359 is a long way off, but\nwhen you stack it up against the distance to Regulus, for instance, it's\njust an inch.\"\n\n\"I'd sure like to go to Regulus,\" said Astro.\n\n\"So would I,\" snorted Roger. \"But we'd probably wind up with a space\ncrawler like Vidac for a skipper. That you can have!\"\n\nNearing the first stop in their tour, Tom signaled ahead to Number\nTwelve to be taken aboard. He waited for the outer portal of the ship's\nair lock to be opened and then sent his tiny spacecraft into a shallow\ndive, applying his braking jets expertly to bring it to a dead stop\ninside the jet-boat deck of the converted space liner. The outer portal\nslid closed and a moment later the air pressure on the deck had been\nbuilt up enough for them to remove their space helmets.\n\nAs they climbed out of the jet boat, the inner air-lock portal slid open\nand Tad Winters, the civilian captain of the liner, appeared. There was\na scowl on his face and he made no attempt to hide his annoyance.\n\n\"Whose idea was this to come snooping around while we're in flight?\" he\nsnarled.\n\nAstro bristled and stepped forward, towering over the smaller spaceman.\n\"If we had anything to say about it, Mr. Winters, your company would be\nthe last we'd want!\"\n\nWinters glanced at Tom and Roger who stood to one side silently, their\nfaces grim.\n\nTom stepped forward. \"Vidac sent us, Winters. We're here to check the\ndepartments and see that everything is in order.\"\n\n\"Vidac, eh?\" sneered Winters. \"What's the matter? Can't he do it\nhimself, instead of sending a bunch of space squirts?\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"The lieutenant governor is busy,\" said Roger sarcastically. \"Very busy,\nin fact.\"\n\n\"Doing what?\" asked Winters.\n\n\"Trying to keep the rest of his space rats in line!\" snapped Roger.\n\n\"Listen, you!\" growled Winters, taking a threatening step toward Roger.\n\"I don't have to take that from you. One word outta me, and Vidac'll\nbury you in the brig.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nTom quickly stepped between Roger and the angry civilian spaceman to\nprevent the impending fight. He stared at Winters and smiled. \"What's\nthe matter, Winters? Need Vidac's help in everything you do?\"\n\n\"Aw, go blast your jets, you space-brained jerks!\" snorted Winters. He\nturned back toward the hatch, but there was noticeably less swagger to\nhis walk.\n\nThe three cadets smiled at each other and followed him into the main\nbody of the ship.\n\nWhile the _Polaris_ was the command ship of the fleet, the nerve center\nof the entire operation, it was still hardly more than a prison ship for\nthe cadets. In direct contrast, the space liner was bright, gay, and\nfull of life. Everything imaginable for the convenience of the colonists\nhad been installed aboard the massive ship. As the three cadets walked\nthrough the ship on their way to the control deck, they passed the\nauditorium where stereos were shown in the evenings and indoctrination\nlectures were given during the day. They passed a number of compartments\nthat served as a school for the children of the colonists. There were\nworkshops where the colonists could make objects for their future homes\nin their spare time. And in the heart of the ship was one of the most\ncomplete and extensive libraries in the Solar Alliance. Audioslides,\nsoundscribers, story spools, question-and-answer tapes, everything\ndesigned to answer just about any question the human mind could ask.\n\nThe main living quarters of the ship were arranged so that each family\nhad a small apartment, complete in every detail, to preserve as much of\nthe family life as possible. There were no governors or supervisors to\ncontrol the colonists. It had been decided to allow the colonists to\nchoose their own leaders aboard the ships. But they were living together\nso peacefully, they hadn't found it necessary to select any one\nindividual to be a leader. The ship was a miniature city.\n\nAs the Space Cadets made their rounds of the power deck, control deck,\nand radar deck, they were amazed by the excellence of the equipment and\nthe care given it. And because they saw nothing to substantiate their\nsuspicions of Vidac, and his hand-picked crew, on Number Twelve, they\nfound themselves confused about their feelings toward him.\n\nOn the power deck, Astro had questioned a rocketman closely about the\narrangement of the baffling around one of the firing chambers. The\npower-deck officer, Shilo Speed, heard Astro's questions, agreed with\nthe cadet, and made the rocketman rearrange the baffling. Then, on the\ncontrol deck, the pilot had been careless in maintaining his position\nwith the other ships in the fleet. Tom mentioned it to Winters, and\nWinters immediately ordered the man off the bridge, and replaced him.\nSuch action for the safety of the colonists had made the cadets wonder\nabout Vidac's ability.\n\nAfter inspecting the ship from radar mast to jet exhausts, the three\ncadets started back for the jet-boat deck. As they retraced their steps,\nthey passed through the library and encountered Hyram Logan and his son\nBilly.\n\n\"Hello, Mr. Logan,\" greeted Tom with a big smile.\n\n\"Well, hello, Corbett,\" Logan replied. \"Didn't know you were aboard\nNumber Twelve.\"\n\n\"We're not assigned to her, sir,\" replied Tom. \"We're just making an\ninspection for the lieutenant governor. How do you like the way she's\nbeing run?\"\n\nLogan's endorsement was immediate. \"Just fine, Corbett. This ship is\nalmost a colony in itself.\"\n\n\"Yeah, including school,\" chimed in Billy sourly. The three cadets\nlaughed. Then the boy grinned and stuck a finger gently into Roger's\nstomach. \"She ain't here, Cadet Manning. My sister is teaching\nkindergarten right now.\"\n\n\"Be quiet, Billy!\" barked his father.\n\nRoger's face turned a slow red while Tom and Astro grinned. After a few\nmore words, the three cadets again headed for the jet-boat deck.\n\n\"That Billy will make a fine radarman someday,\" drawled Astro.\n\n\"How do you figure that, Astro?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"Did you see the way he spotted Roger's roving eye looking for his\npretty sister? Why, in ten years, he'll be picking up asteroids the same\nway.\"\n\nBack in their jet boat a few minutes later, blasting through space on\nthe rest of their tour, Tom turned to his unit mates, a troubled look on\nhis face.\n\n\"Did you notice anything aboard Number Twelve that looked--well,\nsuspicious?\" he asked.\n\nAstro and Roger shook their heads.\n\n\"Me neither,\" said Tom. \"Maybe we've got Vidac pegged wrong. Maybe--\"\n\n\"I thought of that, Tom,\" interrupted Roger. \"But there's one thing that\ndoesn't seem right.\"\n\n\"What's that?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"Your report to Captain Strong,\" Roger replied. \"You sent it to him ten\ndays ago. You should have had an answer by now.\"\n\n\"He's out on Pluto,\" said Astro. \"Space Academy might not have forwarded\nit to him.\"\n\n\"You know the rules,\" said Roger. \"Any official communication to a Solar\nGuard officer is sent through regardless of where he is in the universe,\nif communications are at all possible.\"\n\n\"You're right, Roger,\" said Tom finally. \"I should have had some sort of\nanswer by now.\"\n\n\"You think,\" mused Astro slowly, \"maybe Vidac didn't send the report?\"\n\nRoger hesitated and then replied, \"There's one way to find out.\"\n\n\"How?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"Take a look in the communications logbook on the control deck.\"\n\n\"We can't, Roger.\" Tom shook his head. \"Vidac's got his own men planted\nin every one of our departments.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" growled Astro. \"I been watching the way that guy Smith takes\ncare of the power deck and, believe me, it makes me burn. Why, he hasn't\nwashed down the atomic motor casing once since we blasted off!\"\n\n\"Wait a minute!\" cried Roger suddenly. \"Jeff Marshall!\"\n\n\"Jeff?\" asked Tom. \"What about him?\"\n\n\"He can get to the control deck and take a look at the logbook,\"\nanswered Roger.\n\n\"Say, that's right,\" said Tom.\n\n\"Come on,\" said Roger. \"Let's finish off this tour and get back to the\n_Polaris_. If Vidac's on the level, he'll have sent your report to\nCaptain Strong. If not, we know where we stand.\"\n\nAstro shook his head slowly. \"Honestly, fellas, I don't know whether to\nhope he did or didn't.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTheir tour completed, the three cadets returned to the _Polaris_. They\nquickly audioscribed their report to Vidac and then hurried to the\nobservatory to find Jeff Marshall. Luckily the sergeant was alone and\nthey were able to give him all the reasons for their suspicions of Vidac\nand tell him what they wanted him to do.\n\n\"But what can I say I'm looking for in the logbook?\" Jeff Marshall\nprotested.\n\n\"We passed through a cloud of meteor dust the other day, didn't we?\"\nasked Tom.\n\n\"Yeah,\" replied Jeff, \"but what's that got to do--\"\n\n\"You had to report it to central weather control,\" said Tom. \"Tell the\npilot you lost your own copy of the report and want to get the official\npath out of the log. Tell him the professor wants it.\"\n\nJeff thought a moment, then nodded his head. \"O.K. I'll see you later.\"\n\nThe three cadets returned to their quarters to wait while Jeff went up\nto the control deck. He walked in with a smile, chatted with the pilot a\nfew moments, and then made his request.\n\n\"I want to take a look at the log a minute, Johnny,\" he said casually.\n\"The professor lost his notes on the meteor dust we passed through the\nother day.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said the pilot. He tossed the dog-eared book to the sergeant.\nJeff flipped through the pages and found the day Tom's report was to\nhave been sent. He checked carefully, continuing through the entries for\nthe succeeding days, ending with the last entry made just an hour\nbefore. There was no mention of Tom's report. Jeff turned to give the\nlogbook to the pilot when Vidac and Professor Sykes stepped through the\nhatch. Seeing Jeff with the log in his hands, Vidac frowned.\n\n\"What are you doing here, Marshall?\" he snapped.\n\nJeff was trapped. He came to attention and remained silent. Vidac walked\nacross the control deck and stood in front of him.\n\n\"Well, Marshall?\" he barked. \"Answer me!\"\n\n\"I needed some information about the meteor dust we passed through\nrecently, sir,\" said Jeff.\n\nVidac turned to the professor. \"Did you send him up here?\"\n\nSykes merely shook his head.\n\n\"I lost the professor's notes and needed the information in the logbook,\nsir,\" said Jeff.\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" growled Sykes. \"The notes are still in my\nwork journal. You put them there yourself!\"\n\n\"What have you got to say to that?\" demanded Vidac.\n\n\"I repeat, sir,\" said Jeff, \"that was my reason for looking in the log.\"\n\nVidac paused, and when he spoke, his voice was cold. \"The control-deck\nlogbook contains classified information, Marshall. You know that. I\nwon't say you're lying about reasons for looking at it, but that does\nnot excuse the fact that you _did_ look at it without my permission. I'm\nconfining you to the brig for ten days.\"\n\nJeff didn't bat an eyelash. The fact that he had found no entry of Tom's\nreport to Captain Strong in the log, and the unreasonable annoyance\nVidac expressed over his having looked into the logbook, convinced him\nthat the cadets were not wrong in their suspicions concerning the\nlieutenant governor.\n\nVidac dismissed him and the enlisted sergeant was escorted to the\n_Polaris_' brig by two hastily summoned crewmen.\n\nWhen the cadets learned of Jeff's punishment they immediately went to\nVidac's quarters and requested permission to speak with him. After\nmaking them wait for nearly three hours, Vidac finally received them.\n\n\"Well, what now?\" demanded Vidac.\n\n\"We would like to ask a question, sir,\" said Tom.\n\n\"Speak up!\" snorted Vidac impatiently.\n\n\"It's about Sergeant Marshall, sir,\" said Tom.\n\n\"What about him?\"\n\n\"We would like to know, sir, under what article of the space code was\nSergeant Marshall sentenced to the brig?\"\n\nVidac's eyes sharpened. He spoke quickly and crisply. \"I suspected that\nthere was some connection between Marshall looking in the log and your\ncoming here to see me. I don't know what you have in mind, Corbett, but\nI'm going to lay it on the line. This is the last time you will question\nmy authority. From this moment on, and until you are released from my\njurisdiction, _I_ am the space code. Do I make myself clear?\"\n\n\"Very clear, sir,\" said Tom tightly. \"Then will the lieutenant governor\nplease put in writing any further orders he might have for us?\"\n\n\"I will not!\" snarled Vidac. \"But I tell you what I will do. I'll\nconfine you to your quarters for ten days for that impertinent request!\nAnd if I so much as see your noses outside your quarters, I'll really\nget tough! Dismissed!\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 8\n\n\n\"This is highly irregular, Logan,\" said Vidac to the Venusian farmer,\n\"but I guess you can see the cadets. Perhaps a little advice from you\nwill help them mend their ways.\"\n\nLogan nodded. \"I have a boy of my own, Governor,\" he said, \"and I know\nhow rambunctious they can get.\"\n\nVidac smiled thinly. \"You'll find them in their quarters. The first\nladder to your right and down two decks.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" replied Logan. He left Vidac's quarters and two\nminutes later stepped through the hatch leading into the cadet's room.\nAfter seven days of confinement, the three boys greeted Logan with a\nyell of pure joy.\n\n\"We have guests!\" bellowed Astro, grabbing Roger who was asleep in his\nbunk and then banging on the shower door where Tom was taking a shower.\n\nRoger tumbled out of the bunk and Tom came rushing out of the shower\nwrapped in a towel. They all began talking at once.\n\n\"How'd you know we were confined to quarters, sir?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"It's a wonder Vidac allowed you to come see us!\" yelled Roger.\n\n\"Never mind the questions, sir,\" said Astro. \"It's just plain good to\nsee a different face besides these two space jokers. One more game of\nspace chess with Manning and I think I'd--\"\n\nLogan laughed at the cadets' enthusiasm, holding up both hands to stem\ntheir eager babbling questions. After Tom had dressed hastily and Roger\nhad cleared off a bunk, they began to talk calmly.\n\n\"I didn't know you boys were in trouble,\" said Logan, \"until I came over\nto the _Polaris_ to see you. Then Vidac told me all about it.\"\n\n\"Was there any special reason why you wanted to see us, sir?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"Well, as a matter of fact, there was a little reason. Billy, my son,\nhas been pestering me to get some of your Academy books and audioscripts\nso he can study to become a Space Cadet when he gets old enough.\"\n\nThe three cadets grinned at each other and soon the Venusian farmer was\npiled high with manuals, audioscripts, tapes, and general information\nabout the Academy.\n\n\"Thank you, boys,\" said Logan. \"That's real nice of you, but--\"\n\n\"But what, sir?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"That was the little reason for coming to see you. I have a big reason\ntoo.\"\n\n\"What's that, sir?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"I don't know how to say it exactly,\" began Logan, his voice low and\nhesitant, \"but do you remember when you three came over to inspect\nNumber Twelve?\"\n\nThe boys all nodded and Logan continued in a hushed voice.\n\n\"Well, I told you then that everything was as nice as it could be. At\nthat time it was. But now--\"\n\n\"What's happened, sir?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"What hasn't happened you mean!\" snorted Logan. \"The very next day we\nhad a visit from Vidac himself. He made a routine check of all the\ndepartments, stopped and talked to some of the colonists, and he seemed,\nin general, like a nice fellow. Then all of a sudden it started.\"\n\n\"What?\" asked Astro.\n\n\"Our skipper Winters and another fellow, Ed Bush, began treating us\nlike--well, like prisoners!\"\n\n\"Prisoners!\" cried Tom.\n\n\"Yes!\" said Logan. \"They began to tell us when we couldn't go to the\nworkshop and to the stereos, and made us eat our meals together in the\nmain assembly room, with the wives taking turns doing all the cooking.\nAnd the schooling has been cut altogether.\"\n\n\"Why, why--\" Tom was floored by the information. \"But how can that be?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Logan, \"but that's the way it is. I came over to\ntell you boys about it, since you were the only ones I knew. You struck\nme as being honest and I felt I could trust you.\"\n\n\"What else have Winters and Bush done?\" asked Astro tensely.\n\n\"I guess the worst of all is the fact that we're having to pay for\neverything we eat,\" said Logan.\n\n\"Pay!\" exclaimed Roger. \"But, but--how can you? You don't have any\ncredits. The Solar Council decided to let the colony work on a barter\nbasis--share and share alike--until it could take its place in the\nover-all economy of the Solar Alliance.\"\n\n\"I know, I know,\" said Logan resignedly. \"We're having to pay for the\nthings we get by signing over a percentage of our future profit over the\nnext seven years.\"\n\nThe three cadets looked at each other in disbelief. The idea of two men\nopenly violating the laws of the expedition, treating the Solar\nAlliance citizens as if they were prisoners, was overwhelming.\n\nTom got up and began to pace the deck. Finally he turned and faced\nLogan. \"Have you said anything to Vidac about this?\" he asked.\n\n\"Ummmpf!\" snorted Logan. \"Every one of us signed a petition and had it\nsent to the governor himself. We didn't even get a reply. Vidac must\nhave heard about it and told Winters and Bush to take it easy, because\nthe next day we were allowed to eat again without having to sign over\npart of our profit to them. But everything else is the same.\"\n\n\"But how could they force you to pay?\" asked Roger. \"Couldn't you\nrefuse?\"\n\n\"Sonny,\" declared Logan emphatically, \"I'm brave as the next man. But\nyou don't argue against a paralo-ray gun, especially when there are\nwomen and children to worry about.\"\n\nTom whirled around and faced Roger and Astro. \"I guess we don't need any\nmore proof now,\" he said coldly. \"Jeff Marshall is thrown into the brig\nfor looking into a logbook; we're relieved of our jobs here on the\n_Polaris_; my monthly report to Captain Strong isn't sent to Space\nAcademy, and now this. One of two things is happening. Either Governor\nHardy is in on this with Vidac, or Vidac is taking over without Hardy\nknowing anything about it.\"\n\n\"All right--all right,\" growled Astro, \"but what are we going to do\nabout it?\"\n\n\"We've got to get word to Space Academy or Captain Strong someway,\nsomehow. We've got to let them know what's going on.\"\n\n\"There's only one way to do that,\" said Roger. \"But with the\ncommunications controlled by Vidac's men, we don't have the chance of a\nsnowball on the sunny side of Mercury!\"\n\n\"Then,\" announced Tom firmly, \"we'll have to build our own\ncommunications unit.\"\n\n\"But how?\" asked Logan.\n\n\"Roger here can make a communicator out of spit and bailing wire,\" said\nAstro. \"All he needs is the essential parts.\"\n\n\"Look,\" said Tom tensely, \"Jeff Marshall will be getting out of the brig\nwhen we do. He'll be working with Professor Sykes, along with us. Why\ncan't we build one on the sly in the observatory?\"\n\nRoger thought a moment. \"It's the only thing we can do. I just hope that\nMr. Logan's coming here hasn't aroused suspicion.\"\n\n\"Don't worry about that,\" said Logan. \"I told Vidac I wanted this\ninformation about Space Academy for Billy. That seemed to satisfy him.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" mused Tom. \"He's pretty smart.\"\n\n\"What else can we do?\" asked Astro.\n\n\"Nothing,\" said Tom bitterly. \"Not a space-blasting thing until we get\nout of here!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"We've _got_ to have that triple vacuum tube,\" declared Roger. \"That's\nthe only thing that will transmit a voice quickly back to Earth from\nthis fix out in space.\"\n\nThe three boys and Jeff Marshall were back in their quarters after their\nfirst week of active duty again. They had surreptitiously begun\ncollecting parts for the communicator and were sorting them out on one\nof the bunks when Roger mentioned the necessity for the special vacuum\ntube.\n\n\"How quickly?\" asked Astro.\n\nTom explained. \"The equipment we have now is strong enough to talk to\nthe Academy, but it'll take about six hours for my voice to reach it.\nAnd then another six hours for the Academy's answer to get back to us.\nAt the end of twelve hours we might not be ready to receive and the\ncommunications officer might pick up their answer. Then we'd be in the\nmiddle of a space hurricane!\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Astro. \"You've got to be able to talk directly to the\nAcademy, so that when they answer, you'll be ready!\"\n\n\"Right,\" said Tom. \"We might only get ten or fifteen minutes of free\ntime, when the professor would be away from the observatory.\"\n\n\"Where do you think I could get one of those tubes, besides on the radar\nbridge, Roger?\" asked Jeff. He had been the main source of supply for\nthe equipment used in the communicator. Since getting out of the brig,\nhis movements had not been as restricted as the cadets'.\n\n\"That's just it,\" said Roger. \"I remember distinctly loading all of them\nin the locker near the main scanner on the radar deck.\"\n\n\"Then we have to get it from another ship,\" said Tom. \"The chances of\ngetting one here, aboard the _Polaris_, are zero.\"\n\n\"Say, Roger,\" suddenly asked Astro, \"do you think you remember enough\nabout that triple vacuum tube to draw me a blueprint?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said Roger. \"And you could probably build it too. But how are\nyou going to get the inside tube vacuumized, then the second one, and\nfinally the third. They have to be absolutely clean!\"\n\n\"How about outside in space?\" Astro suggested. \"We could take the parts\nof the tube with us and assemble it out there. You can't ask for a\nbetter vacuum than outer space.\"\n\nTom grinned and slapped the big Venusian on the back. \"Astro, you're the\nhero of the day. Come on, Roger, start drawing that tube! Astro can make\nit on the power deck as if he were repairing something. Make it as\nsimple as possible.\"\n\n\"Right,\" said Roger, \"all I need is the vacuum and of course the copper\nfilament inside the inner third tube for sending and receiving. We can\nmake it so the tubes screw together inside of each other and then seal\nthem.\"\n\n\"Right,\" said Astro.\n\n\"Meantime,\" said Tom, \"Jeff and I will get you a set of earphones, if we\nhave to tear them off the head of the radarman!\"\n\nMeanwhile, in Vidac's quarters, the second-in-command was facing the\nirascible Professor Sykes.\n\n\"Say that again, Professor,\" said Vidac. Sykes was standing before him\nholding a slip of paper in his hand.\n\n\"I said,\" the professor snorted, \"that in forty-eight hours and some odd\nminutes we will be passing through a very thick cluster of asteroids,\nabout ten thousand miles in depth.\"\n\n\"Is it on our present course?\" asked Vidac.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Sykes. \"We'll have to go around it. I wouldn't give you a\nplugged credit for our chances of getting through it.\"\n\n\"I didn't ask you for your opinion!\" snapped Vidac. \"All right, you've\ngiven me your information. Now get out!\"\n\nSykes abruptly turned and left the lieutenant governor's compartment.\nAlone, Vidac paced the floor. After a moment of deep thought he snapped\nhis fingers in decision and turned on the ship's intercom.\n\n\"Corbett! Manning! Astro!\" he bellowed. \"Report to the control deck on\nthe double.\"\n\nA few moments later the three cadets stood before Vidac at rigid,\nstone-faced attention. Vidac turned on the chart projection screen and\npointed to their position in space.\n\n\"Professor Sykes has just warned me that the fleet is approaching a\nfreakish asteroid cluster,\" he announced. \"He estimates it to be of this\nsize.\" Vidac swept his arm over the chart, taking in most of the space\ndirectly in front of their path. \"To go around it, over it, or under it\nwould mean altering the course of the whole fleet and losing about six\ndays' transit time.\" He turned back to the cadets who had been watching\nclosely. \"I want you three to see if you can find a route through the\nbelt and save us the detour time.\" He glanced at his wrist chronograph.\n\"The belt is about forty-one hours ahead of us now. Take a rocket scout,\nlook it over, and report back to me.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Tom. \"Anything else, sir?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Vidac. He stepped closer to the three boys. \"This is not a\njoy ride. I expect you to find a way through that cluster. You have\nenough time to explore the greater part of it.\"\n\n\"But you said forty-one hours, sir,\" retorted Tom.\n\n\"That's plenty of time if you travel at full space speed.\"\n\n\"Full thrust!\" exploded Roger. \"In an unknown asteroid cluster? Why, the\nodds are better than a thousand to one that we'll be ripped open by a\nspace rock. The best we can do is one-quarter space speed.\"\n\n\"You'll open those jets wide or you'll spend the rest of the trip to\nRoald in the brig and I'll send a report back to the Academy on your\ncowardice!\" Vidac paused, then added quietly, \"Do I make myself clear?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Tom, tight-lipped. \"You make yourself perfectly\nclear!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 9\n\n\n\"Do you think it will be safe there?\" asked Roger, as he watched Tom and\nAstro push the half-completed communications set under a workbench\nbehind several large cartons.\n\n\"As safe as any place,\" replied Tom. \"If Vidac has any idea we're\nbuilding it, we could hide it any place and he'd find it. So, as the\nsaying goes, the least hidden is the best hidden. We'll have to take a\nchance.\"\n\n\"Besides,\" chimed in Astro, \"here in the storeroom, Jeff will have his\neye on it all the time. If Vidac starts getting nosy, Jeff will be able\nto shift it to another hiding place without too much trouble.\"\n\n\"Well, that's all we can do now,\" said Tom, straightening up. \"Come on.\nLet's get to the scout ship and blast off before Vidac wants to know\nwhat we're doing.\"\n\nChecking the hiding place one last time, the three cadets left the\nstoreroom and headed for the jet-boat deck. In a few moments they were\nblasting through space toward the rear of the fleet where a rocket scout\nwas waiting for them. The scouts were being carried by the larger space\nfreighters to save fuel. Now one had been fueled and was blasting\nalongside its carrier ship with a skeleton crew. When the cadets' jet\nboat came alongside, the crew of the scout transferred into the jet boat\nand the three cadets took over the scout.\n\nOn the control deck, Tom checked his instruments and made preliminary\ntests on the circuits. Suddenly Roger's voice crackled over the ship's\nintercom. \"Blast that guy Vidac!\" he yelled. \"He's one jump ahead of us\nagain!\"\n\nStartled, Tom called into the intercom. \"What do you mean, Roger?\"\n\n\"The ship's communicator,\" snorted Roger. \"I figured once we got aboard\nthe scout we'd be able to use this set to contact the Academy instead of\nhaving to monkey around with the homemade job back on the _Polaris_. But\nit's no soap.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" boomed Astro over the intercom.\n\n\"The only open circuit here is beamed to the _Polaris_. And the radar is\ntoo complicated to change over to audio communications. We haven't got\nenough time.\"\n\nTom clenched his teeth. He had had the same idea about using the\ncommunications set on the scout to contact the Academy. Now there was\nnothing to do but hope Vidac wouldn't find the one they were building.\nHe called into the intercom again. \"Is the radar working well enough for\nus to search the asteroid cluster without plowing into any space junk?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" growled Roger. \"He left it in working condition all right, but\nif we burn out a tube, we're blacked out until we get back. There isn't\na spare nut or bolt in the locker for repairs.\"\n\n\"But what happens if something happens to the radar when we're in the\ncluster,\" called Astro. \"We'll be sitting ducks for every asteroid!\"\n\n\"That's the chance we have to take, Astro,\" said Tom. \"If we complained,\nyou know what he'd do.\"\n\n\"I sure do,\" growled Astro. \"He'd call us yellow again, because we'd\nrefused to make the trip!\"\n\n\"That's the way it adds up,\" said Tom. \"So I guess we'd better get\nstarted. Stand by to blast!\"\n\n\"All clear fore and aft,\" reported Roger.\n\n\"Full thrust, Astro,\" ordered Tom, \"but stand by for emergency\nmaneuvers. This is going to be a tough trip, fellows. Perhaps the\ntoughest trip we've ever made. So keep your eyes and ears open and\nspaceman's luck!\"\n\n\"Spaceman's luck!\" echoed his unit mates.\n\nUnder full thrust the speedy little ship shot ahead of the fleet toward\nthe gigantic mass of asteroids, planetoids, and millions of lesser space\nbodies, whirling and churning among themselves at an incredible rate of\nspeed. Hardly had they left the fleet when Roger's voice crackled over\nthe intercom again.\n\n\"Say, you space monkeys!\" he yelled. \"I got an idea! How about taking\nthis wagon and heading back for the Academy?\"\n\n\"Can't,\" replied Astro, \"we've only got forty-eight hours of fuel,\nwater, and oxygen--and no reserves. We couldn't get one-tenth of the way\nback before we ran out of everything, even if we wanted to go back.\"\n\n\"What do you mean--_if_?\" snapped Roger. \"Wouldn't you go back? How\nabout you, Tom?\"\n\n\"I'd think a long time before I would,\" said Tom. \"Remember, Vidac\nhasn't done anything we can actually pin on him.\"\n\n\"What about making the colonists pay for their food,\" sneered Roger.\n\n\"Vidac could say it was a precautionary measure,\" said Tom.\n\n\"What kind of precaution?\" asked Astro.\n\n\"Well, Vidac could say that the colonists were using too much of the\nsupplies simply because it was free. And instead of imposing\nrationing, he's making them pay, but that he wouldn't actually take\ntheir profit.\"\n\n[Illustration: _The speedy little ship shot ahead of the fleet toward\nthe gigantic mass of asteroids_]\n\n\"Yeah,\" growled Astro. \"And there's just enough hokum in that to make\neveryone back at the Academy happy.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid we'll have to go on with it,\" said Tom. \"Not only this\nexploration of the asteroid belt, but we'll have to wait for Vidac to\nreally tip his hand.\"\n\n\"From the way he operates,\" said Roger disgustedly, \"that might be\nnever.\"\n\nBlasting farther ahead through the unexplored region of outer space, the\ncadets, who had seen a great many space phenomena, were awed by the\nthickening groups of stars around them. It was Tom who finally realized\nthat they were getting closer to the inner ring of their galaxy and that\nthe stars and suns they were unable to see from Earth, or other Solar\nAlliance planets, were some fifty to sixty billion miles closer.\n\nGulping a cup of tea and a few sandwiches, the three cadets continued\ntheir advance toward the uncharted, unknown dangers of the asteroid belt\nthat lay ahead of them.\n\nMeanwhile, back on the _Polaris_, Jeff Marshall walked into the\nobservatory quietly. He stood and watched Professor Sykes adjust the\nprisms of his telescopes, then settle himself to an hour of observation.\nJeff knew that the professor would remain there for the next two hours.\nHe felt safe in going to the storeroom and taking out the communications\nunit to work on it. But just to make sure, he called out, \"Will you be\nneeding anything, sir?\"\n\n\"No, I won't!\" barked Sykes. \"If I did, I'd ask for it!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\" said Jeff. He turned away with a slight smile on his face\nand left the observatory. He walked quickly through the passageways of\nthe ship until he came to the storeroom hatch. He glanced around\nquickly and then stepped into the quiet chamber. Pulling the cartons\naway from the bench, he took out the half-completed tangle of wires, and\nby the light of a small flashlight, he peered into the maze, trying to\nfigure out where Roger had left off. He had traced the connections and\nwas about to go to work when suddenly the overhead light was switched\non, bathing the storeroom in light. Jeff whirled around to see Vidac,\nstanding in the open hatch, staring at him.\n\n\"Well, Sergeant Marshall,\" he said, advancing toward the enlisted\nspaceman, \"some secret experiment, no doubt!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Jeff. \"I've--I've been working on a new type of\ncommunications set.\"\n\nVidac stepped closer to the set and gave it a quick look. Suddenly,\nwithout warning, he picked up the delicate instrument, smashed it to the\nfloor, and then trampled on it. He whirled around and faced Marshall.\n\n\"What's the meaning of this, Marshall?\" he demanded.\n\nJeff was stunned by Vidac's violent action and could only stammer, \"I\nhave nothing to say, sir.\"\n\n\"Is Corbett or Manning or Astro in on this?\" asked Vidac.\n\n\"No, sir,\" Marshall said quickly.\n\n\"I warn you, it won't go easy with you if I catch you shielding those\ncadets,\" snapped Vidac.\n\n\"No, sir,\" said Marshall, swallowing hard several times, \"I am not\nshielding them.\"\n\n\"Very well, then. Tell me, what was the purpose of this 'experimental'\ncommunications set?\"\n\n\"To make contact with amateur communicators back in our solar system,\nsir.\"\n\n\"I'll bet!\" said Vidac coldly. \"All right, pick up this piece of junk\nand get out of here. Any more experiments will take place in the\nobservatory, and not unless I give my permission, is that clear?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Jeff. \"I understand, sir.\"\n\nVidac turned and walked away without returning Jeff's salute. The\nenlisted spaceman looked down at the twisted mass of wire and metal and\nmuttered a low oath. Then, picking up the pieces, he turned and walked\nwearily back to the observatory. All of Roger's effort was destroyed.\nBut worse than that, now Vidac knew about the attempt to build the set.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Watch out, Tom.\"\n\nRoger's voice blasted through the intercom from the radar deck. \"There's\nthe biggest hunk of space junk I've ever seen bearing down on us!\"\n\nTom flipped on the control-deck scanner of the rocket scout quickly,\nestimated range, angle, and approach of the onrushing asteroid, and\ncalled to Astro on the power deck.\n\n\"Emergency course change!\" he bellowed. \"One-quarter blast on the\nstarboard jets, ten degrees down on the exhaust steering vanes!\nExecute!\"\n\nIn the cramped space of the power deck, the giant Venusian quickly\nresponded to his unit-mate's orders. Opening the induction valves\nleading to the reactors, the cadet shot full power into the radiation\nchambers, sending the little space scout into a long downward curve,\nsafely out of the path of the dangerous asteroid.\n\n\"Whew!\" breathed Roger over the intercom. \"That was fast thinking, Tom.\nI wouldn't have had time to plot a course change. And with all that\nother stuff around here, we might have missed this one and hit two\nothers!\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" agreed Astro. \"It must have been good, because I'm still here!\"\n\n\"Got your radar sweeping ahead, Roger?\" asked Tom. \"Any sign of an\nopening in this stuff?\"\n\n\"Radar's going all the time, Tom,\" replied Roger. \"But I don't think\nwe're going to find a passage large enough to take the whole fleet\nthrough.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid you're right,\" said Tom. \"I guess we'd better get out of\nhere. How much fuel do we have left, Astro?\"\n\n\"Enough to hang around here for another fifteen minutes. But let's not\ncut it too fine. We might have to spend a little time looking for the\nfleet.\"\n\n\"I don't imagine Vidac would lose any sleep,\" sneered Roger, \"if we got\nlost!\"\n\n\"Well, fifteen minutes is fifteen minutes,\" said Tom, \"so we might as\nwell take a look.\"\n\nRoger gave the course change to Tom and the small ship shot to another\nsection of the asteroid cluster while the electronic finger of the radar\nprobed ahead, searching for an opening through the mass of hurtling\nrock. Time and again in the past fifteen hours, the cadets had\ndiscovered what they thought to be a way through, only to find it too\nsmall for the massed flight of spaceships to maneuver safely. Now after\nthe many hours of concentration the boys were tired and more than\nwilling to return to the fleet.\n\n\"Time's up,\" Tom finally announced. \"Plot a course back to the\n_Polaris_, Roger. Stand by for a course change, Astro. We're heading\nhome!\"\n\nTom's remark about heading \"home\" went unnoticed, since the three cadets\nhad long since thought of the giant rocket cruiser as being their home,\nmore than Space Academy or their real homes with their families.\n\nAfter making contact with the _Polaris_, Roger quickly plotted an\nintersecting course that would put them alongside the command ship of\nthe fleet in a few hours. Then, safely out of the dangerous cluster of\nflying meteors and asteroids, the three cadets gathered on the control\ndeck and relaxed for the first time since the beginning of their\nscouting trip. They discussed their chances of contacting Space Academy\nwith the communications set they had left hidden in the storeroom.\n\n\"How far did you get with the tube, Astro?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"You'll be able to send out a message four hours after we get back,\"\nreplied Astro between bites of sandwich.\n\n\"Too bad we don't have the tube with us,\" said Tom. \"Now that we're\nalone we could vacuumize it without worrying about Vidac.\"\n\n\"I've already tried to make another one here,\" said Astro. \"But these\nscouts don't have any kind of tools or equipment. We'll have to wait\ntill we get back.\"\n\nIn a few hours Roger picked up the welcome outline of the _Polaris_ on\nhis scanner and, shortly after, the rest of the fleet. After receiving\ninstructions from Vidac to return the scout to the freighter and come\naboard, the three cadets made quick work of transferring to the jet boat\nand a short while later were waiting impatiently for the hiss of oxygen\nto fill the air lock of the _Polaris_. No sooner had the dial indicated\nthe equal pressure with the rest of the ship than the inner portal\nopened to reveal Vidac waiting for them.\n\n\"Well?\" he demanded at once. \"Is there a way through the asteroid\ncluster?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" said Tom. \"We searched practically the whole thing. There are\na few openings, but none large enough to let the whole fleet through.\"\n\n\"I thought so,\" sneered Vidac. \"You just blasted to the edge of the\ncluster and waited for enough time to pass and then came running back\nhere!\"\n\n\"Why, you--\" growled Astro. He took a menacing step toward Vidac. The\nolder spaceman didn't move.\n\n\"Yes, Cadet Astro?\" said Vidac coldly. \"Did you want to say something?\"\n\nBefore Astro could speak, Tom stepped forward. \"Regardless of what you\nmay think, sir,\" he said, \"we did search the belt and there wasn't any\nway through it.\"\n\n\"I have to accept your word, Corbett,\" said Vidac. He turned and started\nback down the companionway, then stopped and whirled around to face them\nagain. \"Incidentally, something happened while you were away. Jeff\nMarshall was found experimenting with a homemade communicator. Do you\nknow anything about it?\"\n\nThe three cadets were dumfounded. Finally Roger shook his head.\n\"No--no, sir,\" he muttered. \"We don't know anything about it.\"\n\nVidac smiled. \"All right. That's all. Make out a full report on the\nscouting mission and send it to me immediately.\"\n\nWhen the lieutenant governor had disappeared, Roger turned to face Tom\nand Astro. \"Well, what do we do now?\"\n\nTom answered between clenched teeth. \"We're going to see Governor\nHardy!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 10\n\n\n\"Now, now, boys,\" purred Governor Hardy, \"I think you're jumping to\nconclusions. Personally I'm very much pleased with the way Lieutenant\nGovernor Vidac is handling details. And as far as the asteroid cluster\nis concerned, we'll go under it, or over it, or whatever is the shortest\nroute.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Tom, \"but--\"\n\n\"No _buts_, Corbett,\" said Hardy, still smiling. \"This is a great\nundertaking and we need the co-operation of every member of the\nexpedition. In a few days we'll be arriving at Roald and the strain of\nthis long trip will be over. Mr. Vidac is a capable man and I trust him\nimplicitly, no matter how strange his methods may appear. I urge you to\nbury any differences you might have with him and work for the success of\nthe colony. Now what do you say?\"\n\nTom glanced at his two unit mates. Roger shuffled his feet and looked\ndown at the deck, while Astro studied the bulkhead behind the governor's\ndesk. \"If that's the way you want it, sir,\" said Tom, \"then I guess\nwe'll have to play along.\"\n\n\"I guess you will,\" said Hardy, a slight edge creeping into his voice.\n\"And if you tell me any more wild, unsubstantiated stories such as Vidac\nsending you to scout an unknown asteroid cluster in a poorly equipped\nrocket scout--well, I'll have to take stronger measures to ensure your\nco-operation. Do I make myself clear?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" chorused the cadets. They saluted and left the room.\n\n\"Well,\" said Tom, when they had reached the safety of their quarters, \"I\nguess that just about does it.\"\n\n\"Yeah. We played our last card,\" grumbled Roger. \"Either Hardy is the\nsmoothest crook in the world, or Vidac really has him space happy.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't bet that it isn't a little bit of both,\" commented Astro.\n\nThe hatch suddenly opened and the cadets spun around nervously.\n\n\"Jeff!\" they yelled in unison.\n\n\"Hello, guys,\" said the enlisted man glumly as he entered the room. He\nslumped on Tom's bunk. \"I've got bad news.\"\n\n\"We already know,\" said Roger. \"Vidac met us before we got out of the\nair lock. He couldn't wait to tell us.\"\n\n\"He asked us if we knew anything about it,\" said Tom. \"We told him No.\"\n\n\"I lied myself,\" said Marshall. \"I--I was going to do a little work on\nit, hoping to have it ready for you when you got back, but--\" He stopped\nand shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Never mind, Jeff,\" said Tom. \"If Vidac suspected we were building that\ncommunicator, he'd have found it sooner or later. The thing is, what are\nwe going to do now?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you in three words,\" growled Astro. The others looked at the\nbig cadet. \"Sweat it out,\" he said finally.\n\nTom nodded his head. \"You're right, Astro. We're tied hand and foot to\nthis guy for the next eleven months.\"\n\n\"How about Governor Hardy?\" suggested Jeff.\n\n\"We just saw the illustrious governor,\" said Roger bitterly. \"And the\nonly question left in our minds is whether Hardy is working for Vidac,\nor Vidac for Hardy. No one could be as blind to what's going on as Hardy\nseems to be.\"\n\n\"Three words,\" said Tom half to himself. \"Sweat it out!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLike a gleaming diamond on the black velvet of space, the sun star Wolf\n359 loomed ahead of the giant fleet, solitary and alone in its\nmagnificence. With the _Polaris_ leading the way for the mass of space\nvessels that stretched back and away, the pioneers and their families\nblasted through the last million miles that separated them from their\nnew home in deep space.\n\nFifty-five billion miles from their own sun, they were about to\nestablish a colony as their forefathers had done centuries before them.\nLike the first colony in the new world, then on the Moon, Mars, Venus,\nMercury, Titan, and Ganymede, and hundreds of outposts in the asteroid\nbelt, these Earthmen were braving new dangers and hardships, leaving the\ncomfort of their homes to establish the first star colony. Inside each\nof the massive ships, Earthmen gathered around the scanners to look\nahead across the abyss of space and gaze at their new home. Finally the\nmomentous order came crackling through the teleceivers.\n\n\"_Polaris_ to fleet! Single up for landing! Ships to follow the\n_Polaris_ and touch down in order of their fleet numbers!\"\n\nOn the control deck of the command ship, Vidac began barking orders to\nTom. The three cadets had been reassigned to their original stations\nbecause of their intimate knowledge and sure handling of the giant ship.\n\n\"Prepare the ship for touchdown, Corbett!\" yelled Vidac.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Tom. He flipped on the intercom and barked orders to\nAstro below on the power deck.\n\n\"Stand by to reduce thrust to one-quarter space speed, Astro. Stand by\nforward nose braking rockets.\"\n\n\"Right,\" replied Astro.\n\n\"Hey, Roger!\" yelled Tom. \"How far are we from the surface?\"\n\n\"Estimated distance to touchdown is two hundred thousand feet,\" answered\nRoger crisply.\n\n\"Reduce thrust to minimum, Astro,\" barked Tom, his eyes watching every\ndial and meter on the control board.\n\n\"Distance one hundred fifty thousand feet,\" reported Roger. \"Looks like\nan open plain right below us. Maybe we'd better try for it, eh?\"\n\n\"I guess so,\" said Tom. \"Relay your scan down here to the control-deck\nscanner.\" Tom gave it a quick glance, saw that there was plenty of room\non the plain Roger had mentioned to hold the entire fleet, and turned to\nVidac. \"Request permission to touch down, sir,\" said Tom.\n\n\"Granted,\" replied Vidac.\n\nThe curly-haired cadet turned back to the control board and once again\nchecked his instruments. Behind him, Vidac and Governor Hardy watched\nthe surface of Roald as the _Polaris_ began to turn for her tailfirst\nlanding.\n\n\"Cut all thrust at one hundred thousand feet, Astro,\" ordered Tom.\n\n\"Aye, aye,\" replied Astro.\n\n\"One hundred ten thousand feet,\" reported Roger. \"One-O-seven,\none-O-four, one hundred!\"\n\nAlmost immediately, the blasting roar of the rockets was cut to a\nwhisper and the ship began to drop toward the surface of the satellite.\n\nVidac jumped forward and grabbed Tom's shoulder. \"What're you trying to\ndo, Corbett? We're falling!\"\n\n\"I have no data on the gravity of Roald,\" said Tom calmly. \"The best way\nto find out is to check our rate of fall. I can then gauge the amount of\nbraking power necessary.\"\n\nBehind the two spacemen, Governor Hardy smiled. He stepped forward and\ntapped Vidac on the shoulder. \"Whatever your difficulties coming out\nhere with them, Paul, you've got to admit that they know how to handle\nthis ship.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" growled Vidac. \"Too bad they don't know how to handle themselves\nas well.\"\n\nTom smarted under the sarcasm but concentrated on the task of getting\nthe ship safely to the ground.\n\n\"Fifty thousand feet,\" reported Roger. \"I'd say that the gravity of\nRoald is about 2.7 over Earth's, Tom.\"\n\n\"O.K., Roger,\" replied Tom. \"Give her one-quarter thrust, Astro. We'll\nhave to feel our way down.\"\n\nAs the rumble of the main rockets started again, Tom waited for the\nship's descent to be checked, and sudden concern welled up within him as\nthe ship failed to respond.\n\n\"Thirty-five thousand feet,\" reported Roger from the radar deck.\n\n\"Full thrust, Astro,\" called Tom, anxiously watching the approaching\nsurface of Roald. He checked his instruments again and his heart jumped\nup into his throat. The needles of all the gauges and meters were\ndancing back and forth as though they were being flicked with invisible\nfingers.\n\nTom grabbed the intercom and shouted wildly. \"Astro! Emergency space\nspeed! We've got to get out of here!\" Tom whirled around to face Vidac\nand Hardy. \"You'd better call Professor Sykes up here, right away,\" he\ndeclared.\n\n\"Why? What's the matter?\" stuttered Hardy.\n\n\"Something's interfering with our whole electrical system, sir,\" replied\nthe cadet.\n\n\"What's that, Corbett?\" snapped Sykes, stepping quickly through the\nhatch into the control room. Tom was about to repeat his statement when\nsuddenly the rockets blasted loudly, and the ship tossed and rocked,\nthrowing everyone off his feet. Astro had applied emergency power to his\nreactors, sending the _Polaris_ hurtling back into the safety of space.\n\n\"By the rings of Saturn,\" bawled Sykes, after he had adjusted to the\nsudden acceleration, \"I'll have that space-brained idiot court-martialed\nfor this!\"\n\n\"It's not his fault, Professor,\" said Hardy, getting to his feet again.\n\"If Corbett hadn't ordered emergency space speed, we'd all be smeared\nacross that plain down there.\" He pointed to the scanner screen where\nthe surface of Roald could be seen receding rapidly.\n\n\"Umph!\" snorted Sykes, \"let me take a look at that control board.\"\n\nQuickly and surely, the professor tested every major circuit in the\ngiant panel. Finally he straightened up and turned to face Hardy.\n\n\"Governor,\" he said quietly, \"I'm afraid you'll have to forget about\nlanding on Roald until I can find the reason for the disturbance.\"\n\n\"Then it's not caused by any malfunction aboard the ship?\" Vidac broke\nin.\n\nSykes shook his head. \"Whatever force field caused those instruments to\nreact the way they did came from Roald. You'll have to stand off until I\ncan go down and make a complete investigation.\"\n\n\"Well, what do you think it is?\" asked Hardy.\n\n\"It might be one of a hundred things,\" replied the professor. \"But I\nwouldn't attempt to land down there until we know what's causing the\ninterference and can counteract it.\"\n\n\"Space gas!\" exploded Vidac. \"Is this another of your tricks, Corbett?\"\n\n\"Tricks, sir?\" asked Tom stupidly, so incredible did the lieutenant\ngovernor's question seem.\n\n\"Yes, _tricks!_\" roared Vidac. \"Get out of the way. I can take this ship\ndown.\" He sat down in the pilot's chair and called Roger on the radar\nbridge. \"Notify all the other ships they are to stand off until we have\nmade a secure touchdown!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\" replied Roger.\n\n\"Professor,\" whispered Tom, \"do something!\"\n\nSykes looked at Tom a moment and then turned to leave the control deck.\nHe paused in the hatch to call back in a low voice, \"What can you do\nwith a madman?\"\n\nHelplessly, Tom turned to appeal to Governor Hardy but changed his mind\nand stood beside Hardy, crossing his fingers.\n\nAt the controls Vidac gripped the acceleration lever and called into the\nintercom, \"Stand by for touchdown. Power deck, cut all thrust!\"\n\n\"Power deck, aye, sir,\" reported Astro.\n\nAs the main rockets were cut out again and the _Polaris_ slipped back\nthrough space toward the surface of Roald once more, Tom stood behind\nVidac with Hardy and watched the instruments begin their strange\ngyrations again. The cadet glanced at Hardy, whose face was impassive.\n\n\"Sir,\" asked Tom quietly, \"isn't there something we can do?\"\n\n\"Keep quiet, Corbett,\" snapped Hardy. \"That's what you can do!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Tom. He turned away to climb into the nearest\nacceleration chair and strap himself in. He knew it was possible for the\n_Polaris_ to land successfully. He felt sure he could have made a\ntouchdown on the satellite without trouble, but his first thought had\nbeen for the safety of the others aboard the ship. Now it was out of his\nhands and he grudgingly admired the way Vidac was handling the giant\nrocket cruiser.\n\n\"Twenty-five thousand feet to touchdown,\" reported Roger.\n\nSo far, Vidac had kept the ship dropping at a steadily decreasing rate.\nBut the tension on the control deck mounted as the surface of Roald\nloomed closer and closer.\n\n\"Fifteen thousand feet,\" reported Roger.\n\nGovernor Hardy walked to a near-by acceleration chair and strapped\nhimself in.\n\n\"Ten thousand feet!\" yelled Roger.\n\n\"Power deck, give me three-quarters thrust!\" ordered Vidac. Tom heard\nthe whine of the rockets on the power deck increase with a sharp surge.\n\n\"Seven thousand feet,\" reported Roger.\n\nVidac remained cool, staring at the control board. Tom wondered what it\nwas he was watching, since there wasn't one instrument that registered\nproperly.\n\n\"Five thousand feet!\" screamed Roger. \"Spaceman's luck!\"\n\n[Illustration: _The_ Polaris _landed safely on the surface of the\nsatellite_]\n\nImmediately Vidac ordered Astro to apply full thrust to the main\nrockets. The great ship bucked under the sudden acceleration, and Tom\ncould feel the tug of war between the cruiser's thrust and the\nsatellite's gravity. The ship continued to drop at slightly lessened\nspeed, but still too fast to land safely.\n\nTom waited for Vidac to order emergency thrust to counter the pull of\nthe satellite. They were dropping too fast. He watched Vidac and waited\nfor the only order that would save the ship. If he doesn't do it now,\nthought Tom, it will be too late.\n\n\"Vidac!\" yelled Tom. \"Emergency power! We're falling too fast!\"\n\nVidac didn't answer. \"Vidac!\" screamed Tom again. \"Emergency power!\"\n\nThe man didn't move. He sat in front of the control panel as though\nparalyzed. Tom slipped off the straps of the acceleration chair and\nraced to the intercom. Vidac made no attempt to stop him.\n\n\"Astro! Full emergency thrust! Hit it!\"\n\nIn immediate reply, a jolting burst of power blasted through the tubes,\njerking the ship convulsively and throwing Tom to the deck. A loud,\ncrashing sound filled the ship, followed by a strange stillness. Dimly\nTom realized that the rockets had been cut and they were safely on the\nsurface of the satellite.\n\nHe picked himself up and turned to face Vidac. The lieutenant governor\nwas unstrapping himself from the pilot's chair. His face was ashen. He\nstalked out of the control deck without a word.\n\n\"Touchdown!\" screamed Roger from the radar deck. \"We made it. We're on\nRoald!\"\n\nTom heard the blond-haired cadet, but his unit mate's excitement did not\nregister. He was staring at the open hatch. \"He lost his nerve,\" said\nTom aloud, half to himself and half to Governor Hardy who was\nunstrapping himself from the acceleration chair. \"He quit cold!\"\n\n\"He certainly did,\" said Hardy. \"And if it wasn't for your quick\nthinking, we'd be spread all over this satellite!\"\n\nRoger tumbled down the ladder from the radar deck. \"Nice work, Tom,\" he\nshouted, slapping his unit mate on the back. He followed Tom's gaze past\nHardy to the empty hatch.\n\n\"Say, can you imagine a guy like that suddenly losing his nerve?\" asked\nRoger.\n\n\"No,\" replied Tom. \"If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes I wouldn't\nbelieve it!\"\n\n\"This will go on your official record of course,\" said Hardy. \"I'll see\nthat you're rewarded in some way, Corbett.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said Tom. \"But if you could just assure me that my\nreports back to the Academy will get through, I'll be very happy.\"\n\n\"You mean they're not being sent?\" asked Hardy, seemingly quite\nconcerned.\n\n\"No, sir,\" replied Tom. \"At least I don't think so. And this is the\nfirst time I've had a chance to tell you.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Hardy, \"there's a lot to be done now that we've arrived,\nCorbett. I'll take this matter up with Vidac as soon as I get a chance.\"\nHe turned and walked off the control deck.\n\n\"Well, I'll be a space monkey!\" exclaimed Roger.\n\n\"Yeah,\" agreed Tom, \"I'll be two of them!\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 11\n\n\n\"Of the thousand ships that blasted off from Earth there are only six\nhundred thirteen left that can be used in the construction of the first\ncolony of Roald.\"\n\nGovernor Hardy's voice was firm as he addressed the assembled colonists\nand spacemen from the air lock of a space freighter.\n\nThere was a murmur among the colonists at this news. They knew that the\nlandings on the satellite had been costly; that many ships had crashed\nas a result of the unexplained interference with the ships' instruments.\nAnd since each ship had been designed to be cannibalized into houses,\nworkshops, and power plants, they realized the plans for the settlement\nwould have to be radically revised.\n\nOnce the _Polaris_ had landed safely, the other ships of the fleet had\nfollowed, each trying to find the delicate balance between the pull of\nthe satellite and the thrust of their rockets. And since many of Vidac's\nhand-picked crewmen were in control, a large number of the valuable and\nirreplaceable ships and their supplies had been lost. They didn't burn\nwhen they crashed. Fire could have been easily extinguished. Instead,\ndeadly radiation from the cracked firing chambers flooded the ships and\ntheir cargo, rendering them useless.\n\nTom, Roger, and Astro stood with Jeff Marshall and the Logan family as\nthe governor outlined their initial objectives on the satellite.\n\n\"First,\" declared Hardy, \"we have to build atmosphere booster stations.\nWe can't live without oxygen and there isn't enough oxygen in the\natmosphere to sustain us very long. Second, we have to establish our\nownership boundaries and begin planting our crops. We can't live without\nfood. Third, we have to live more frugally than ever before in order to\nmaintain our reserves of food and essential items. The nearest supply\ncenter is fifty billion miles from here.\" He paused and surveyed the sea\nof grim faces before him.\n\n\"We've had a hard blow,\" he continued, \"in losing so many ships and\ntheir supplies, but it will not defeat us. We all came here with the\nunderstanding that it would be difficult. We did not expect an easy\nlife. We knew it would be tough, but not quite as tough as it's going to\nbe now. But we will win! And remember, we are no longer people of Venus,\nEarth, Mars, or Titan, we are citizens of Roald!\"\n\nThere was a roar of approval from the colonists. A band began to play\nand the assembly was adjourned.\n\n\"He talks sense,\" Hyram Logan commented. \"Real fighting sense!\"\n\n\"I'd like it a lot better, though,\" replied Astro, \"if he didn't make it\nsound like a rally.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" agreed Roger. \"He sounded as though he was pepping up his team\nto do or die in a mercuryball game.\"\n\n\"This is no game,\" said Tom. \"We're fighting starvation, perhaps death!\nAnd, believe me, if this colony goes the way of all space dust, it will\nbe a long time before there'll be another fleet of a thousand ships\ngambled on a star colony!\"\n\nLogan nodded his head. \"That's the way I look at it, Tom,\" he said.\n\"Regardless of what kind of beef we might have with Hardy or Vidac and\nhis crew, we all have to work together to make Roald a colony. A\nsuccessful colony!\"\n\nReturning to Fleet Ship Number Twelve, which was to be used for quarters\nby the colonists until their homes could be erected, the three cadets\nand Jeff Marshall said good-by to the Venusian farmer and continued on\ntoward the _Polaris_.\n\n\"Did Professor Sykes find any indication of what might have caused the\ninstruments to act up during the landing, Jeff?\" asked Tom. The\ncurly-haired cadet referred to the professor's investigation started as\nsoon as the _Polaris_ had landed.\n\n\"Nothing so far, Tom,\" replied Jeff. \"But it must be something big. He\npacked a lot of gear into a jet boat and blasted out of here this\nmorning.\"\n\n\"What do you suppose it is?\" asked Astro.\n\n\"I don't know,\" replied Jeff. \"I can't even guess.\"\n\n\"I can,\" said Roger, \"and if it's what I think it is--well, I just hope\nit isn't, that's all.\" The blond-haired cadet stopped talking abruptly.\n\nTom, Astro, and Jeff looked at each other. Finally Tom asked, \"Well,\nwhat do you think it is?\"\n\n\"There's only one thing I know really well, Tom,\" replied Roger. \"Just\none thing, and that's electronics. I may be a jerk about a lot of\nthings, but I know electronics.\"\n\n\"O.K.,\" said Astro. \"You know electronics. But what has that got to do\nwith the instruments going out of whack?\"\n\n\"The only natural element that would cause such disturbance is uranium.\"\n\n\"Uranium!\" breathed Tom. \"You mean uranium pitchblende?\"\n\n\"I mean uranium!\" snapped Roger. \"Uranium pitchblende isn't concentrated\nenough to cause a reaction like that on the instruments. It would take a\nbig chunk of pure uranium to do the job.\"\n\n\"But if that were so,\" Astro protested, \"wouldn't the instruments still\nbe acting up? In fact, wouldn't we start feeling the effects of the\nradiation?\"\n\n\"Not necessarily, Astro,\" said Tom. \"I understand what Roger's getting\nat. The uranium could be located in another sector of the satellite, on\nthe other side, maybe. It could be throwing radiation out into space\nwithout affecting us here.\"\n\n\"You mean we're _under_ the effects?\" asked Astro.\n\n\"Looks like it,\" replied Tom. \"But on the other hand,\" he continued,\n\"why wasn't there some report of it when the first expedition came out\nto look over the satellite?\"\n\n\"I can't answer that question, Tom,\" answered Roger. \"But I'd be willing\nto bet my last credit that there's uranium on this space-forsaken rock.\nAnd a whopping big deposit of it!\"\n\nThey reached the air lock of the _Polaris_ and climbed wearily aboard.\nAt the end of the first day, on the new satellite, they were exhausted.\nA few minutes after entering the giant cruiser they were all sound\nasleep.\n\nDawn of the second day on Roald saw the vast plain crowded with men at\nwork. The first community objective was the construction of an\natmosphere station, and before the woman and children had finished\nlunch, they were breathing synthetically produced air.\n\nWorking from a master plan that had been devised back at Space Academy\nbefore the expedition blasted off, the colonists were divided into three\nseparate crews: the wreckers, those who would remove essential parts\nfrom the spaceships as they were needed; the movers, those who would\nhaul the parts to construction sites; and the builders, those who would\ntake the parts and construct the community buildings.\n\nThe first and most difficult job was building a gigantic maneuverable\nderrick and jet barge for removing, hauling, and installing the heavy\nmachinery.\n\nAstro had been assigned to the crew responsible for the construction of\nthe jet barge. With many of the vital parts aboard the crashed\nfreighters still hot with radioactivity, the crew had to improvise. And\nAstro, with his native talent for mechanics, soon became the unspoken\nleader of the crew. Even the supervisor acknowledged the young cadet's\nsuperior ability and allowed him a free hand in the construction of the\nbarge. After six hours of hard labor, the \"mover\" was finished. It was\nnot the streamlined machine its designer had conceived, but it was\neffective, in some cases, more so than the designer imagined. A low,\nflat table roughly three hundred feet square, it moved on sledlike\nrunners and was powered by two dozen rockets. On each of the four sides\nthere was a two-hundred-foot boom which could be swung around in a 360\u00b0\narc and was capable of lifting three hundred tons. Astro's most\noutstanding improvement on the original design was what he termed\n\"adjustment rockets,\" placing single rockets that could be individually\ncontrolled on all four sides, so that the operator of the giant jet\nbarge could jockey into perfect position anywhere. The machine quickly\ndemonstrated it could move anything, anywhere.\n\nRoger worked with the supervisor of the assembly groups, ordering\nsupplies and machinery as they were needed from the wrecking crews and\nseeing that they were sent to the right place at the right time. One of\nhis first jobs was the assembling of materials for the construction of\nthe Administration Building of the colony. Less than five days after the\nfoundation had been dug, the last gleaming sheets of Titan crystal were\nwelded together and the building towered over the plain, a glistening\nmonument to man's first flight to the stars.\n\nTom had been assigned to work closely with Vidac, who was responsible\nfor all the construction on Roald. The young cadet welcomed the chance\nto observe the man in action, and time after time he found\ncontradictions in the character of the lieutenant governor. Vidac's\nattitude and behavior in his drive to build the colony were completely\ndifferent from his actions on the long space flight. He was a man of\nfirmness and immediate decision. Shooting from one project to another in\na jet boat, he would listen to the supervisors' complaints, make a snap\ndecision, and then head for another project. Once Tad Winters and Ed\nBush, who had taken over Astro's jet barge, had hesitated when trying to\ntransfer a four-hundred-ton lift. A bank of atomic motors from Fleet\nShip Number Twelve was to be installed in the main power plant for the\ncolony. The motors were in a position where it was impossible to use\nmore than one of the booms for the lift. Bush and Winters tried futilely\nto maneuver the jet barge into position where they could use two booms,\nand when Vidac arrived he promptly took charge. Using Tom as signalman,\nVidac stood at the controls of the giant derrick, and after testing the\nstrain on the five-inch cables, he yelled down to the cadet:\n\n\"Think they'll hold, Corbett?\"\n\nTom looked at the derrick, the motors, and the boom Astro had\nconstructed. Finally he nodded his head. If anyone else had built the\njet barge, Tom would have said No, but he knew when the Venusian built\nsomething it was built solidly.\n\nStepping back out of range, Tom watched Vidac slowly apply power to the\nrockets on the jet barge. Slowly, inch by inch, the boom began to bend\nunder the load. Vidac continued to apply power. The boom bent even more\nand still the motors would not lift free of the ground. The rocket\nexhausts on the jet barge glowed fiery red under the sustained surge of\npower. All over the colony, men stopped work to see if the jet barge\nwould handle the outsized lift.\n\nVidac sat at the controls calmly and watched Tom. The curly-haired cadet\ncontinued to wave his hand to lift the motors. The boom continued to\nbend, and just as Tom thought it must snap, the motors lifted free and\nVidac swung them around to the table top of the barge. He climbed down\nand walked over to Bush and Winters.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Next time you're afraid to try something and waste valuable time,\" he\nbarked, \"you'll pay for it!\"\n\nHe turned to Tom. \"Let's go, Corbett,\" he said casually.\n\nDay after day the work continued and finally, at the end of three weeks,\nthe dry barren plain had been transformed into a small city. Towering\nabove the city, the Administration Building glistened in the light of\ntheir new sun, Wolf 359, and streets named after the colonists radiated\nfrom it in all directions, like the spokes of a giant wheel.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThere were houses, stores, and off the central square a magnificent\nassembly hall that could be transformed into a gymnasium. There were\nsmaller community buildings for sanitation, water, power, and all vital\nservices necessary to a community. Along the wide spacious streets,\nstill being paved, converted jet boats hummed. Women began to shop. Men\nwho had helped build the city the day before, now appeared in aprons and\nbegan keeping account books until a monetary system could be devised. A\nmedical exchange that also happened to sell spaceburgers and Martian\nwater was dubbed the \"Space Dump\" and crowds of teen-agers were already\nflocking in to dance and frolic. A pattern of living began to take form\nout of the dead dust of the star satellite. Several of the colonists who\nhad lost everything aboard the crashed ships were made civilian\nofficials in charge of the water, sanitation, and power departments.\n\nThe three cadets worked harder than they had ever worked before. Once,\nwhen the jet barge needed to be refueled, Vidac had ordered them to\nsalvage the remaining reactant from the crashed ships and they worked\nforty-eight hours in lead-lined suits transferring the reactant fuel to\nthe jet barge.\n\nIn addition, Roger was now hard at work building a communications center\nand a network all over the satellite. Communicators were placed at\nintervals of ten miles, so that any stranded colonist was within walking\ndistance of help.\n\nThe four hundred ships that had crashed had been loaded mostly with\nfarming equipment, and the seriousness of the situation was discussed at\ngreat length by Logan and other farmer colonists. Vidac had tried to\nsalvage some of the more basic tools needed in farming the dusty\nsatellite soil, but nothing had come of it. Three to five years had to\npass before the radioactivity would be harmless.\n\n\"We'll have to farm with chemicals,\" announced Vidac finally to a\nmeeting of the farmers. \"I know that chemical crops are not as tasteful\nas naturals, but they are larger, more abundant, and nourishing.\" He\npaused and looked at the men. \"However, even chemicals are not the whole\nanswer.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Hyram Logan, who had become the unofficial spokesman for\nthe farmers, \"give us the chemicals and let's get to work. Everyone here\nknows how to grow crops out of a test tube!\"\n\n\"I'm afraid it won't be as simple as that,\" said Vidac. \"Perhaps you\nremember that you paid over part of your future profits during the trip\nout from Atom City?\"\n\nThere was a murmur from the group of men as the outrageous incident was\nbrought up. Most of the men felt that Vidac had been directly\nresponsible. Vidac held up his hand.\n\n\"Quiet, please!\"\n\nThe men became silent.\n\n\"You will have to purchase the necessary material for farming from me.\nYou will sign over one-half of your future profits to the treasurer of\nthe Roald City Fund, or you don't farm.\"\n\n\"What's the Roald City Fund?\" demanded Isaac Tupin, a short, thin man\nwith an uncanny knack for farming. He had been very successful on Mars\nand had been asked to institute his methods of desert farming on the\ndusty satellite.\n\n\"The Roald City Fund,\" said Vidac coldly, \"is an organization dedicated\nto the good and welfare of the citizens of Roald.\"\n\n\"Who's the treasurer?\" asked Logan.\n\n\"I am,\" said Vidac. \"Governor Hardy is now in the process of setting up\nRoald currency. Each of you will be allowed to borrow against future\nyields, a maximum amount of five thousand Roald credits. This will be\nyour beginning. If your crops fail\"--Vidac shrugged his shoulders--\"you\nwill forfeit your land holdings!\"\n\nThere was a storm of protest from the assembled farmers. They stood up\nin their chairs and hooted and howled. Vidac faced them coldly. At last\nthey fell silent and Vidac was able to speak again.\n\n\"I would advise you to consider carefully the proposal I've made here.\nYour equipment--the equipment given to you by the Solar Alliance--has\nbeen lost. The chemicals which you are now being offered are the\nproperty of the official governing body of Roald. We cannot give you the\nmaterial. We can loan it to you, providing that you guarantee the loan\nwith your future profits. All those interested may draw the necessary\nsupplies from Tad Winters and Ed Bush in the morning.\"\n\nHe turned and walked out of the hall.\n\n\"We'll go to the governor!\" shouted Logan. \"We won't be treated like\nthis. We're free citizens of the Solar Alliance and under their\njurisdiction. We know our rights!\"\n\nSuddenly Tad Winters and Ed Bush appeared, seemingly from nowhere. A\nsneering smile on his face, Winters held two paralo-ray guns and covered\nthe group of farmers while Bush slipped up behind Logan and hit him on\nthe back of the neck. The elderly man sank to the floor.\n\n\"Now get this!\" snarled Winters to the colonists. \"The joy ride is over!\nYou take orders, or else!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 12\n\n\n\"What do you want?\" growled Ed Bush. He stood at the air lock of the\n_Polaris_, a brace of paralo-ray guns strapped to his side. \"Why ain't\nyou out growing corn?\"\n\nHyram Logan smiled. He held out the books and study spools the cadets\nhad given him on the trip out. \"I wanted to return these to the cadets.\nThey lent them to my son. He wants to be a Space Cadet when he's old\nenough.\"\n\n\"I can think of a lot better things he could be,\" sneered Bush. He\njerked his thumb toward the entrance port of the giant spaceship. \"All\nright, get aboard. You got a half-hour.\"\n\nLogan entered the cruiser quickly and made his way to the cadets'\nquarters. Tom was asleep. Roger and Astro were playing a game of\ncheckers. When Logan entered, the two cadets quickly forgot their game\nand turned to greet the farmer.\n\n\"Hiya, Mr. Logan!\" said Astro. \"You saved me from doing a wicked deed.\"\n\nLogan stared at the big cadet, puzzled. \"How's that again, Astro?\"\n\nRoger laughed. \"He's joking, sir. I was about to clean him out in a game\nof checkers.\"\n\nLogan sat wearily on the side of the nearest bunk. \"I wish all I had to\nlose was a game of checkers.\"\n\nHe quickly filled in the details of the meeting between Vidac and the\nfarmers. Tom had awakened by this time and heard the last of the older\nman's story. He turned to his unit mates.\n\n\"Well, it looks as though we're right back where we started,\" he said.\n\"And here I thought Vidac was O.K. after the way he worked during the\npast ten days setting up Roald City.\"\n\n\"I've been talking to some of the other men,\" said Logan bitterly. \"They\nfeel the same way I do. Something's got to be done about this!\"\n\n\"But what?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"And how?\" chimed in Astro.\n\n\"Force, by the stars!\" yelled Logan. \"And when I say force, I mean\nthrowing Vidac and Hardy and his crew out!\"\n\n\"You can't do a thing like that, sir,\" said Tom. \"It would be playing\nright into their hands. Remember, Vidac and Hardy represent the Solar\nAlliance here on Roald. If you tried force, you would be charged with\nrebellion against the Solar Alliance!\"\n\n\"Well,\" snorted Logan, \"what have _you_ got in mind?\"\n\n\"When the enemy is in full control, Mr. Logan,\" said Tom quietly, \"the\nbest thing to do is draw back and regroup, then wait for the right\nmoment to attack. Vidac wants you to revolt now. He's expecting it, I'm\nsure. But if we wait, he can't get away with making you mortgage your\nland holdings or your profits. Somewhere along the line he'll slip up,\nand when he does, that's when we start operating!\"\n\nMeanwhile, in his luxurious office in the Administration Building, Vidac\nsat behind a massive desk, talking to Tad Winters.\n\n\"Now that the land boundaries have been established, and the colonists\nhave their little pieces of dirt,\" he said, \"we can go right to work.\nI've told the farmers that they'll have to sign over half of their\nprofits to get chemicals to farm with. They're already talking about\nrevolt, which is just what I want them to do. Let them rebel. We can\nthrow them into the brig, send them back to Earth, and take over their\nproperty in the name of the City of Roald!\"\n\n\"Which is you,\" said Tad Winters with a smile. \"That's the smartest idea\nyou've ever had, boss!\"\n\n\"In a short while,\" continued Vidac, \"the entire satellite will be mine.\nShips, houses--and--\"\n\nSuddenly the door opened and Ed Bush hurried into the room.\n\"Boss!--boss!\" he shouted breathlessly. \"Logan is spilling everything to\nthe Space Cadets!\"\n\n\"What?\" cried Vidac. \"How did that happen?\"\n\n\"He came to the _Polaris_,\" whined Bush. \"Said he had some books and\nstuff he wanted to return, so I let him aboard. Luckily I followed him\nand listened outside the door.\"\n\n\"What did they talk about?\" demanded Vidac.\n\n\"Logan told them about the meeting with the farmers the other night. He\nwanted to get the colonists together to start a rebellion, but Corbett\nconvinced him it would be the wrong thing to do.\"\n\n\"What?\" yelled Vidac. He rose and grabbed Bush around the throat. \"You\ndirty space crawler! You've ruined everything. All my plans messed up,\nbecause you let a hick and a kid outsmart you!\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, boss,\" Bush whined. \"I didn't know.\"\n\n\"Get out of here!\" Vidac snarled. \"I should have known better than to\njeopardize the whole operation by signing on a couple of space jerks\nlike you two! Get out!\"\n\nThe two men left hurriedly and Vidac began to pace the floor. He was\nacutely aware that his scheme was out in the open. All of the careful\nplanning to keep the cadets off balance and unsure of him until he could\nmake his move was lost. He regretted not having gotten rid of them\nbefore, out in space, where unexplained accidents would be accepted. He\nhad placed too much confidence in Bush and Winters and had\nunderestimated the cadets. Something had to be done--and fast! But it\ncouldn't be anything obvious, or his plans of taking over Roald would\nfail.\n\nThe buzz of the teleceiver on his desk interrupted his train of thought\nand he flipped open the small scanner.\n\n\"Professor Sykes to see you, sir,\" reported his aide in the outer\noffice.\n\n\"Tell him to come back later,\" said Vidac. \"I'm busy.\"\n\n\"He says it's very important,\" replied the aide.\n\n\"All right--all right, send him in,\" snapped Vidac and closed the key on\nthe teleceiver irritably. A second later the door opened and Professor\nSykes entered hurriedly. He was dirty and dusty from his ten-day stay in\nthe desert wastes of the satellite.\n\n\"Vidac!\" cried Sykes excitedly. \"I've just made the most tremendous\ndiscovery in the history of the Solar Alliance!\"\n\nVidac eyed the professor calculatingly. He had never seen the old man\nexcited before. \"Sit down, Professor,\" he said. \"You look as if you just\nwalked through the New Sahara on Mars. Here, drink this!\" Vidac offered\nthe professor a glass of water and waited expectantly.\n\nSykes drank the water in one gulp and poured another glass before taking\nhis seat. He began digging into his pouch and pulling out sheets of what\nappeared to be exposed film. He rummaged around for his glasses, and\nafter adjusting them on his hawklike nose, began to sort the sheets of\nfilm.\n\n\"When the instruments on the _Polaris_ went crazy out in space,\" began\nSykes nervously, \"I knew there was only one thing that could cause such\na disturbance. Radioactivity! As soon as we landed, I began to look for\nthe source. At first I used a Geiger counter. But I couldn't get an\naccurate count. The counter was as erratic as the instruments. So I\ntried film. Here is the result.\" He handed the exposed film to Vidac.\n\"This film was protected by lead sheeting. It would take a deposit of\npitchblende richer than anything I've ever heard of to penetrate the\nlead. But look at it! The film is completely exposed. The only thing\nthat could do that is a deposit of uranium at least seventy-five per\ncent pure!\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nVidac studied the films closely. \"Where is this strike?\" he asked\ncasually. \"Is it on land that has been parceled out to the colonists?\"\n\n\"I don't know whose land it's on. But I'm telling you this! It's going\nto make someone the richest man in the Solar Alliance!\"\n\nSykes fumbled in his pouch again and this time brought out a dirty piece\nof paper. \"This is a report giving the location and an assay estimate.\nIt has to be sent back to the Solar Council right away. Have\ncommunications with Earth been established yet?\"\n\nVidac shook his head and reached out for the report. \"If what you say is\ntrue,\" he said coolly, \"we can always send it back on the _Polaris_.\"\n\nHe took the report and read it over. He recognized immediately the\ndanger of Sykes's discovery. He laid the film and the report on his desk\nand faced the professor. \"And you are absolutely sure of your findings?\"\n\nSykes snorted. \"I've been working with uranium all my life. And I should\nknow a deposit like this when I see one!\"\n\nVidac didn't answer. He turned to the teleceiver and flipped it on.\n\"Send Winters and Bush in here right away,\" he told the aide.\n\n\"You going to send those two back with this report?\" asked Sykes.\n\"Personally I'd feel a lot safer if you'd send those Space Cadets and my\nassistant, Jeff Marshall. They may be young, but they can be depended\non.\"\n\n\"I'd rather send men _I_ can depend on, Professor,\" said Vidac. \"As you\nsay, the cadets are still quite young. And this report is too important\nto take chances.\"\n\nThe door opened and Winters and Bush entered.\n\nVidac stuffed the report and the exposed film into a dispatch case and\nquickly sealed it. He handed it over to Winters. \"Guard this with your\nlife,\" said Vidac seriously.\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" said Sykes. \"Aren't you going to tell Governor Hardy\nabout this?\"\n\n\"This is so important, Professor,\" said Vidac, \"that I think we should\nget it off at once. There's plenty of time to tell the governor.\"\n\n\"Well, all right.\" Sykes got up and stretched. \"After almost two weeks\nin that desert, I'm ready for a nice clean bed and something to eat\nbesides synthetics.\" He turned to Winters and Bush. \"That pouch is worth\nmore than any man ever dreamed of. Be sure you guard it well!\"\n\n\"You can depend on us, Professor,\" said Winters.\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Bush. \"Don't worry about a thing.\"\n\nThe three spacemen watched the professor leave. As soon as the door\nclosed, Vidac grabbed the pouch out of Winters' hand. His face hardened\nand his eyes were narrow slits.\n\n\"You messed up one operation for me, but luck has given us another\nchance. If you mess this one up, I'll dump you into space for a long\nswim. Now listen to me!\"\n\nThe two spacemen crowded close to Vidac's desk.\n\n\"Sykes has just made the biggest discovery in the universe. It's worth\nbillions! The cadets are in our way, and as long as the professor is\nalive, so is he! We're going to wipe them out. I want you to take the\nprofessor to that asteroid we spotted a few days ago and keep him there.\nI'm going to accuse the cadets of getting rid of the old man, so we can\neliminate the cadets, the professor, and keep the uranium secret for\nourselves. His report says it's located at section three, map eight.\nThat's the property given to Logan. After we get rid of the cadets and\nthe professor, we'll have plenty of time to bounce old Logan. This is\nthe sweetest operation this side of paradise. And it's all mine!\"\n\n\"But what kind of proof will you have that the cadets did something to\nthe old man?\" asked Winters. \"Getting rid of Space Cadets is a pretty\ntricky job.\"\n\n\"Tomorrow I'll assign the cadets to work with the professor again. That\njerk, Manning, has a sharp tongue. I'll set up something that will get\nthem into an argument in the presence of some of the colonists. When\nSykes disappears right after that, we'll have witnesses to prove that\nManning was gunning for the old man!\"\n\n\"But how do you know that Manning will get mad enough?\" asked Bush.\n\nVidac smiled. \"I know Manning. And besides, I know what I'm going to do,\nto _make_ Manning blast his tubes!\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 13\n\n\nThe first real community problem came when it was learned that the\nentire supply of school study spools were lost in the crashed ships.\nThere was talk among the colonists of sending a ship back to Earth at\nonce for replacements, but Vidac stepped in and took over. He called a\nmeeting with the three Space Cadets, Jeff Marshall, and Professor Sykes,\nand told them of his plan.\n\n\"I want you to make new study spools on every subject you can remember,\"\nVidac ordered. \"Simple arithmetic, spelling, geography, celestial\nstudies, physics, in fact, everything that you learned in prep\nschool--and before that.\"\n\n\"That may be all right for boys,\" grumbled Professor Sykes, still\nsmarting under the refusal of his violent protest at being taken from\nhis uranium studies and placed in charge of the school problem. \"But\nwhat about the girls? There are quite a few of them and they need\nspecial consideration.\"\n\n\"What kind of consideration?\" asked Vidac.\n\n\"Well, whatever it is a girl has to know. Sew, cook, keep house, take\ncare of children and--and--\" The professor sputtered, hesitated, and\nconcluded lamely, \"A--a lot of things!\"\n\nVidac smiled. \"Very well. I'll speak to a few of the mothers and see if\nI can't get you some assistance. In the meantime, I want you, Corbett,\nManning, Astro, and Marshall to do what you can about beginning the\nchildren's schooling.\"\n\n\"All right,\" snorted Sykes, \"but I can think of better ways to spend the\nnext two or three weeks.\"\n\n\"And one more thing, Professor,\" continued Vidac. \"I want it clearly\nunderstood that you are responsible for the cadets. For what they do, or\n_don't_ do!\"\n\nThe faces of the three cadets began to flush under the sarcasm.\n\n\"And I want you to pay particular attention to Manning,\" Vidac went on.\n\"He seems to have the biggest mouth in the unit.\"\n\n\"Well, he'd better watch his step with me or he'll find himself in a\nspace hurricane!\" Sykes said gruffly.\n\nVidac turned to Roger, but the blond-haired cadet was staring down at\nhis boots. Vidac suppressed a smile. A few days under the whiplash\ntongue of Sykes, who would be anxious to finish the project and return\nto his own studies, and Manning would either buckle or flare up in open\nrevolt. The lieutenant governor considered the possibilities and nodded\nin satisfaction.\n\n\"That's all, Professor Sykes,\" he said, rising and then turning to the\ncadets. \"And I'd advise you boys to give the professor all the aid you\ncan.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Tom. \"We understand. We'll do our best.\"\n\n\"Dismissed,\" said Vidac.\n\nThe three cadets and Marshall saluted sharply and filed out of the room.\nBut Professor Sykes hesitated and turned to Vidac.\n\n\"I'd like to speak to you a moment about the--ah--\"\n\n\"That's been taken care of, Professor,\" replied Vidac. \"Nothing to worry\nabout.\"\n\n\"Has the complete report been sent back?\" asked Sykes.\n\n\"I said it had been taken care of,\" answered Vidac coolly. \"That's all\nyou have to know! Dismissed!\"\n\nSykes hesitated, nodded, and finally followed the cadets from the room.\n\nVidac turned and flipped on the intercom. \"I want Ed Bush in here and I\nwant him fast!\" he barked. Then, swinging his chair around, he gazed out\nthe window. He could see the entire city of Roald spread out before him\nand the sight filled him with pleasure. With the ownership of the\nuranium deposit and full control of the colony, mastery of the entire\nsatellite and possibly the star system itself was only one short step\naway.\n\nThe door opened and Ed Bush hurried breathlessly into the room. \"You\nsent for me, boss?\" he asked.\n\nVidac swung around to face his lieutenant. \"How much do you know about\nelectronics and astrophysics?\" he snapped.\n\n\"Why, as much as the average guy, I guess,\" answered Bush.\n\n\"Well, you're going to learn more,\" said Vidac. He began to outline his\nplan quickly. \"I want you to hang around Sykes and the cadets on this\nnew education project. They're going to make study spools for the colony\nkids. Manning will be in charge of electronics and astrophysics. Now\nhere's what I want you to do....\"\n\nWhile the lieutenant governor was outlining his plan to his henchman,\nthe three cadets were entering their new quarters on the lower floor of\nthe Administration Building.\n\n\"Can you imagine that guy?\" asked Astro. \"Picking on Roger in front of\nProfessor Sykes? He as good as told the professor to give Roger a hard\ntime!\"\n\nAs the big Venusian slammed one hamlike fist into the other, Tom nudged\nhim in the ribs and then turned to Roger with a smile.\n\n\"Don't worry about it, Roger,\" said Tom. \"We've got a job to do. Getting\nthe school system going here on Roald is important, and whether you like\nhim or not, Professor Sykes is the best man to handle it.\"\n\n\"I realize that, Tom,\" said Roger. \"But I don't know how long I can--\"\n\nJeff Marshall suddenly appeared in the doorway of their quarters.\n\"Professor Sykes wants to see us right away, fellows,\" he announced.\n\"And watch your temper, Roger. Just do the best you can, and the\nprofessor will leave you alone.\"\n\n\"You said it,\" agreed Tom. \"Nothing in the universe talks as loudly as\nhard work. Let's all show him.\"\n\nThe three cadets followed the enlisted spaceman out of the room and\nheaded toward Sykes's quarters. Tom's thoughts were confused. He wasn't\nsure of his feelings any more. So much had happened since their\ndeparture from Space Academy. Then, suddenly, he realized that he hadn't\nsent his second report to Captain Strong. He wasn't even sure whether\nhis first report had gotten through. He turned to Astro and remarked\ncasually, \"I wonder what Captain Strong is doing right now?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" replied Astro. \"But I sure wish he was here!\"\n\n\"Say it again, spaceboy,\" growled Roger. \"Say it again!\"\n\nAt that moment over fifty-five billion miles away, in his office high in\nthe Tower of Galileo, Commander Walters was talking with Captain Steve\nStrong and Dr. Joan Dale. The stern-faced, gray-haired commander of\nSpace Academy frowned as he read a report Joan Dale had just given him.\n\n\"Are you sure of this, Joan?\" he asked.\n\n\"I'm positive, Commander,\" replied the beautiful young doctor of\nastrophysics. \"The tests are conclusive. There is uranium on Roald!\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"But I don't understand why it wasn't discovered before this?\" mused\nStrong. \"It's been nearly a year since the first exploratory expedition\nout to Roald.\"\n\n\"Samplings of the soil of Roald were taken from all sections of the\nsatellite, Steve,\" replied Joan. \"On-the-spot tests were made by the\nscientists of course, but there were no indications of uranium then. But\ncadets majoring in planetary geology tested the soil samples as part of\ntheir training. Several of them reported uranium findings. And I checked\nall their examinations carefully, besides making further tests of my\nown. That report is the result.\" She indicated the paper on Walters'\ndesk.\n\n\"But you say the deposit is probably a large one,\" Walters protested.\n\"How could it have been missed?\"\n\n\"Not necessarily large, sir,\" said Joan, \"but certainly of the purest\nquality.\"\n\nWalters looked up at Strong. \"Well, Steve?\"\n\n\"Joan told me about it, sir,\" said Strong. \"And since an investigation\nis probably the next step, I came over, hoping you'd let me go along.\"\nHe paused and looked at Joan.\n\n\"Steve would also like to see his crew of Space Cadets.\" Joan smiled.\n\"He hasn't received a report from them yet, and I think he's worried\nthey might be involved in some mischief!\"\n\n\"No report, eh?\" asked Walters.\n\n\"No, sir,\" replied Steve. \"I thought one would be waiting for me when I\ngot back from Pluto. But there wasn't any.\"\n\n\"Ummmh!\" mused Walters. He looked at his calendar. \"About time for them\nto send in a second report too. Tell you what, Steve. They might be\nhaving a tough time setting up things out there on Roald. Suppose you\nget things organized to investigate the uranium report. And if no word\ncomes in from the cadets by the end of the week, then you can blast\noff.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said Strong. \"Will you excuse me, sir? I'd like to get\nto work right away.\"\n\nAt Walters' nod, Strong saluted briskly and left the office. Walters\nturned to Joan.\n\n\"You know, I don't think he's half as interested in finding a big\nuranium deposit as he is in seeing those boys!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn four separate soundproof cubicles in a small office in the\nAdministration Building on Roald, the three space cadets and Jeff\nMarshall racked their brains to remember simple equations and formulas,\nknowledge learned years ago but long-since forgotten, for the more\ncomplicated subjects of space, time, and rocket travel. Now, trying to\nrecall simple arithmetic and other elementary studies, the cadets and\nMarshall worked eighteen hours a day. Speaking directly into\nsoundscribers and filling what seemed to be miles of audio tape, the\nfour spacemen attempted to build a comprehensive library of a hundred\ncarefully selected subjects for the children of Roald. Professor Sykes\nlistened to the study spools as they were completed. He listened\ncarefully, reviewed their work, edited it, and made notes for follow-up\ncomment. Then, at the end of the day, he would hold a final meeting with\nthem, outline what he wanted the next day, and reject spools that he\nfelt were not satisfactory. For older children's studies, the three\ncadets and Jeff had divided their work into four classifications. Roger\ncovered electronics, astrophysics, astrogation, and allied fields. Astro\ntook charge of rockets, missiles, power machinery, and applied uses of\natomic energy. Jeff's work was biological, bacteriological,\nmineralogical, and geological. Tom covered social studies, government,\neconomy, and history.\n\nResting as comfortably as possible, each of the four spacemen would sit\nand think. And when he had gone as far back as he could in his memory of\nformal education and acquired knowledge, he would begin to talk into the\nsoundscriber. Of all the spools, Tom's were edited the least. And\nProfessor Sykes had unbent enough to compliment the curly-haired cadet\nfor his lucid thinking and acute memory. Astro's work needed the most\nediting. The giant Venusian found it difficult to explain what he did\nwhen he repaired atomic power plants, or how he could look at a piece of\nmachinery and know instinctively when it was out of order. He worked\ntwice as hard as the others, simply because Sykes made him do everything\nover.\n\nOn the other hand, Roger sailed along as smoothly as a jet boat. His\ngrasp of the fundamentals in his field made it easy for him to fill the\nstudy spools with important information. Jeff, too, found it easy to\nexplain the growth of plants, the function of bacteria, the formation of\nplanet crusts, and other allied subjects.\n\nSo, day after day, Tom, Astro, Roger, and Jeff Marshall spent their\nwaking hours in the cubicles searching their minds for every last\nprecious drop of knowledge they could impart to the children of Roald.\n\nVidac's warning to Professor Sykes to keep an eye on Roger had been\nforgotten by everyone in the concerted effort to do a good job. And when\nthe cadets and Jeff left their work one night after a loud argument\nbetween the professor and Roger over the best way to explain the theory\nof captive planets, they thought nothing of it. The argument hadn't been\nunusual. It had happened many times on the same score. Professor Sykes\nwas prone to favor dry, factual explanations. And the cadets believed\nsome of the theories needed explanations in terms a youngster could\nunderstand. Sykes did not object to this method, but was wary of losing\nfacts and clarity in the method of instruction. In this particular case,\nRoger had given in to Sykes, but only after a heated argument. And when\nthey went back to their quarters, there was none of the usual\ndiscussion. They were too tired. They fell asleep as soon as their heads\ntouched their pillows.\n\nThe next morning, still groggy, their heads filled with facts and\nfigures, buzzing with dates and explanations, they returned to their\ncubicles for more of the same. Sykes met them at the office door.\n\n\"Well, Manning!\" he snapped. \"You still insist you know more, _and_ can\nteach better than I, eh?\" He glowered at the cadet.\n\n\"I don't understand, sir,\" said Roger.\n\n\"You don't, eh?\" screamed Sykes. \"You came back here last night and\nchanged that spool to _your_ liking!\"\n\n\"I did what?\" asked Roger, incredulous. Only a few moments before he\ncould hardly drag himself from his bunk. The idea of returning to the\noffice before the required time was incredible. \"I'm sorry, sir,\" he\nsaid, \"but I only got out of bed a few minutes ago.\"\n\nEd Bush and several colonists suddenly appeared and Sykes whirled around\nto face them.\n\n\"Well! What do you want?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Governor Vidac said we could pick up some of the spools that were\nready,\" said Bush.\n\n\"Well, there isn't anything ready now,\" growled Sykes. \"When I'm\nfinished, I'll let Vidac know.\" He turned back to Roger.\n\n\"Well, Manning? What have you got to say for yourself?\"\n\n\"I don't know what you're talking about, sir!\" answered Roger.\n\n\"Cadet Manning,\" shouted Sykes, \"do you remember our conversation last\nnight on the subject of circular motion of captive planets around a sun\nstar?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Roger.\n\n\"And do you recall your childish manner of explaining it?\" sneered\nSykes.\n\n\"Now just a minute, sir,\" said Roger, \"I might be wrong--but--\"\n\n\"Quiet!\" The professor was screaming now. He turned around and inserted\na study spool in a soundscriber. Turning it on he waited, glaring at\nRoger. The blond-haired cadet's voice came over the machine's\nloud-speaker clearly and precisely.\n\n\" ... the idea of motion of one satellite around a mother planet, or\nplanet around a sun star, can best be explained by the use of a rock\ntied to the end of a rope. If you swing the rope around your head, the\nrock will maintain a steady position, following a measured orbit. The\nplanets, and their captive satellites, work on the same principle, with\nthe gravity of the mother planet substituted for the rope, and the\nsatellite for the rock....\"\n\nSykes stopped the machine, turned, and glared at Roger. \"Do you deny\nthat that is your voice?\"\n\nRoger shook his head. \"It's my voice all right but--\"\n\n\"_And_ do you deny that last night, before we left, it was decided that\nmy explanation would be used?\"\n\nRoger's face reddened. \"No, sir,\" he said tightly.\n\n\"Then how do you explain that _your_ voice with _your_ explanation is\nnow on the master spool?\" screamed Sykes.\n\n\"I--I--can't explain it, sir,\" said Roger, fighting to control his\ntemper.\n\n\"I can!\" snapped Sykes. \"You sneaked back in here last night and\nsubstituted your original recording--the one I threw out!\"\n\n\"But he couldn't have done that, Professor,\" interjected Tom. \"He was\nasleep all night!\"\n\n\"Were you awake all night, Corbett?\" asked Sykes coldly.\n\n\"No, sir,\" replied Tom.\n\n\"Then you couldn't possibly know if he was sleeping or down here\nrecording, could you?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" said Tom quietly.\n\n\"Cadet Manning, this is the most disgusting, disgraceful performance\nI've ever seen by a Space Cadet!\"\n\n\"Then you're calling me a liar, sir,\" said Roger quietly, \"when I deny\nthat I did it.\"\n\n\"Can you explain it?\" demanded Sykes.\n\nRoger shook his head and remained silent.\n\n\"Get out!\" screamed Sykes. \"Vidac warned me about you! Go on! Get out! I\nwon't work with a liar and a cheat!\"\n\nBefore anyone could stop him, Roger leaped forward and stood in front of\nSykes, grabbing him by the front of his uniform. \"I've had enough of\nyour insults and accusations!\" he shouted. \"If you weren't an old man,\nI'd drag you out of that Solar Guard uniform and beat your ears off!\nYou're so crazy, you make everyone around you nuts! If you have any\ncomplaints about my work, put them in writing and give them to the\ngovernor!\"\n\nHe turned and stalked out of the office.\n\n\"Roger, wait!\" called Tom, rushing after his unit mate with Astro at his\nheels.\n\nThe colonists began to whisper to each other excitedly, but Ed Bush\nmerely stood in the doorway and smiled!\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 14\n\n\n\"That's right,\" sneered Winters. \"Professor Sykes has disappeared and\nVidac wants to talk to you!\"\n\nThe burly spaceman stood in the open door of the cadets' quarters, legs\nspread apart, hands on the paralo-ray guns strapped to his side. Tom,\nRoger, and Astro eyed the man sleepily.\n\n\"Say that again,\" said Tom.\n\n\"I said Vidac wants to talk to you!\" Winters shouted. \"Now pile out of\nthose bunks before I pull you out!\"\n\nAstro sat up and looked at Winters. His voice rumbled menacingly. \"I'll\ngive you five seconds to get out of here,\" he said quietly. \"And if you\ndon't, I'll ram those ray guns down your throat! One--two--three--\"\n\nWinters tried to match Astro's withering gaze and finally backed out the\ndoorway. \"Vidac wants to see you on the double, and that means,\n_double!_\" He disappeared from view.\n\nTom and Roger were already out of their bunks and pulling on their\nuniforms.\n\n\"What do you think?\" asked Roger, looking at Tom.\n\n\"I don't know, Roger,\" said Tom, \"but I don't like the looks of it.\"\n\nAstro jumped lightly to the floor. \"I kinda wish Winters had tried\nsomething,\" he said with a smile. \"I need a little early-morning\nexercise.\"\n\n\"Good thing he didn't,\" commented Roger dryly. \"We're in enough trouble\nwithout you mauling one of Vidac's pet boys.\"\n\nTom listened halfheartedly to the chatter of his unit mates. He was\nthinking ahead to their meeting with Vidac. Since Roger's argument with\nthe professor, they had continued their work, but under a severe strain.\nThey had finally finished the series of study spools the night before,\nand Tom felt sure that Vidac had waited until the work was finished\nbefore he called them on the carpet. And then, too, there was the\ndisappearance of Professor Sykes that Winters had mentioned. The young\ncadet felt there was trouble ahead.\n\nA few moments later the three cadets presented themselves to Vidac in\nhis office in the Administration Building.\n\nThe lieutenant governor was seated behind his desk and appeared to be\nvery tired. Tom saluted smartly and stepped forward.\n\n\"_Polaris_ unit reporting, sir,\" said Tom.\n\n\"Where is Professor Sykes?\" demanded Vidac abruptly without even\nacknowledging the salute.\n\n\"Why, I--I don't know, sir,\" replied Tom.\n\n\"How about you, Manning? Astro?\" asked Vidac, turning to the other\ncadets. \"You have anything to say?\"\n\n\"We only heard about it ten minutes ago, sir,\" volunteered Roger.\n\n\"I'll bet!\" snapped Vidac. He got up and stepped around his desk to face\nthe cadets. \"You three were the last ones to be seen with the professor.\nWhat happened last night?\"\n\n\"We finished the study spools and left him in the office, sir,\" said\nTom. \"Then we went for a swim in the pool and had a bite to eat before\nhitting the sack. That's all.\"\n\n\"Did anyone see you in the pool?\" asked Vidac.\n\n\"I doubt it, sir. We didn't notice anyone around,\" said Astro. \"It was\npretty late.\"\n\n\"Did anyone see you at the mess hall when you went to get a bite?\"\npursued Vidac. \"Surely there must be someone who can substantiate your\nstory.\"\n\nThe three cadets looked at each other. \"I guess not, sir,\" said Roger.\n\"It was pretty late. After midnight.\"\n\nVidac eyed them curiously. \"And you're sure you saw no one, and that no\none saw you?\"\n\n\"We can't be sure that no one saw us, sir,\" said Tom, \"but I doubt it.\nAs Roger said, it was after midnight.\"\n\nVidac whirled and sat down again. He pressed a small button on his desk\nand waited, silently considering the cadets, his eyes cool and level.\nThe door opened and Governor Hardy walked in, followed by several men.\n\nTom suddenly realized that it was the first time they had seen the\ngovernor in nearly six weeks.\n\n\"Have you found Professor Sykes?\" he demanded.\n\nVidac shook his head, then turned to the other men. Tom, with a sudden\nsinking feeling in the pit of his stomach, recognized them as the\ncolonists who had been with Ed Bush when Roger had his last argument\nwith the professor.\n\n\"Did you hear Cadet Manning threaten Professor Sykes?\" asked Vidac.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied one of the colonists.\n\n\"What did he say?\" asked Vidac. \"Repeat it for Governor Hardy.\"\n\nThe colonist quoted Roger's threat almost word for word and Tom noted\ngrimly that the witness made the most of the fact that he and Astro had\nfollowed Roger out of the office after the argument. The implication\nwas clear that they were part of the threat.\n\nVidac then turned to Ed Bush. \"Bush, did you see the cadets last night?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Bush.\n\n\"Where?\" demanded Vidac.\n\n\"Leaving the swimming pool with the professor.\"\n\n\"With the pro--!\" exclaimed Tom.\n\n\"Shut up, Corbett!\" barked Vidac, and then turned to Astro. \"Did you say\nyou went swimming _alone?_\"\n\n\"We did!\" exclaimed the Venusian. \"We left the professor at the office.\nWe did not see him again after that. He did not go swimming with us.\"\n\nVidac turned to Winters. \"Did you see the cadets last night, Winters?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied the spaceman. \"I had the graveyard watch and I was\nin the galley having a cup of coffee. I saw the cadets enter the galley\njust as I was leaving.\"\n\n\"Were they alone?\" asked Vidac.\n\n\"No, sir,\" said Winters. \"Professor Sykes was with them.\"\n\n\"That's a lie!\" shouted Roger. \"We were alone!\"\n\nVidac merely looked at Roger and then turned back to Winters. \"Then what\nhappened?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Winters, \"they got into an argument, the cadets and Sykes.\nIt was about the movement of a captive planet, or something like that.\nAnyway, there was a scuffle, and all of a sudden the big cadet\"--he\nindicated Astro--\"picked up the professor and carried him out of the\ngalley. The other two followed.\"\n\n\"Didn't the professor put up a fight?\" asked Vidac.\n\n\"Oh, yes, sir,\" said Winters. \"But he didn't have a chance against the\nthree cadets.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you do something about it?\" Governor Hardy suddenly broke\nin.\n\n\"I tried, sir,\" replied Winters calmly. \"I ran after them, but they all\npiled into a converted jet boat and blasted out of there.\"\n\n\"Then what did you do?\" asked Vidac.\n\n\"That's when I came to get you, sir,\" said Winters. \"And we started\nlooking for them.\" Winters paused. \"Ah--pardon me, sir, but can I go\nnow? I've been up all night and I'm pretty tired.\"\n\nVidac nodded and Winters left the room.\n\n\"You mean you've been up all night looking for the cadets?\" asked Hardy.\n\"Weren't they in their quarters?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" replied Vidac and turned to the cadets. \"Well,\" he demanded,\n\"what have you got to say for yourselves?\"\n\nThe three cadets were silent.\n\n\"I must warn you,\" continued Vidac, \"this is a serious matter and\nanything you say may be used against you. But on the other hand, if you\nspeak freely and are willing to co-operate, I will do what I can to\nlessen your punishment.\"\n\nHardy suddenly stepped forward and slammed his fist on Vidac's desk.\n\"None of that! There'll be no favors to criminals!\" He turned to the\ncadets angrily.\n\n\"What did you do with the professor?\" he demanded.\n\nThe cadets kept silent.\n\n\"Where did you take him?\" he shouted.\n\nNeither Tom, Roger, or Astro batted an eyelash. They kept their eyes\nfront and their lips tight.\n\n\"I warn you, you'll spend the rest of your lives on a prison rock if you\ndon't answer!\"\n\nTom finally turned and looked straight at the governor. \"May I speak,\nsir?\"\n\n\"Only if you tell me what you did with Professor Sykes,\" replied Hardy\nangrily.\n\n\"You have not asked us, sir,\" said Tom coolly, \"to tell our side of\nthe story. You are accusing us of a crime and have already assumed that\nwe are guilty. We are not.\"\n\n[Illustration: _Bush pulled a paralo-ray gun from his belt and said,\n\"All right, march!\"_]\n\n\"Do you deny it?\" asked Hardy.\n\n\"We deny everything,\" said Tom flatly.\n\nHardy whirled around to face the colonists, Vidac, and Bush. \"I want it\nclearly understood by everyone here that Space Cadets Tom Corbett, Roger\nManning, and Astro, in the face of testimony given by eyewitnesses as to\ntheir argument with Professor Sykes, and their later abduction of the\nprofessor, do now conspire to withhold information which might help save\nthe professor's life!\" He turned to Vidac. \"I want them arrested and\nheld for investigation of their activities last night. Confine them to\ntheir quarters.\"\n\nVidac stood up and nodded his head to Bush. \"Take them away. Keep a\nguard outside their quarters at all times.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Bush. He pulled a paralo-ray gun from his belt and\ncocked it. \"All right, march!\"\n\nThe cadets of the _Polaris_ unit spun on their heels in unison and\nmarched from the room in perfect order.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Attention! Attention! This is Captain Strong in rocket cruiser _Orion_\ncalling central communications control, Roald! Come in, Roald! _Orion_\nto Roald! Come in!\"\n\nAboard the space cruiser, Captain Steve Strong tried again and again to\ncontact the star colony. For nearly five days, blasting through space at\nemergency speed, the Solar Guard captain had tried to contact the\nsatellite, but to no avail. He snapped off the audioceiver and slumped\nback in his chair, a worried frown on his face.\n\nWhen the second report from the _Polaris_ unit had failed to come in,\nStrong had received permission from Commander Walters to blast off\nimmediately for Roald. Walters agreed that it would be better for the\ncaptain to go alone, since the uranium discovery must be kept an\nabsolute secret. Working by remote control relays from the control deck,\nCaptain Strong handled the ship as easily as a jet boat and he kept the\natomic reactors wide open.\n\nHe stared into the astrogation prism and sighted on the cold light of\nthe sun star Wolf 359. Still unable to see the satellite circling the\nstar, the captain's thoughts were on the past rather than the future. He\nstill couldn't find any reasonable explanation for his suddenly having\nbeen taken off the Roald colony project and sent on the minor mission to\nPluto. He had often thought about the man who had replaced him, Paul\nVidac. Strong had heard the name before and associated it with something\nunpleasant. He couldn't put his finger on what it was, since he had\nnever met the man. Certainly there was nothing illegal about him. His\nrecord had been carefully checked, or he would never have been put in\nthe position of trust he held now. Still there was a persistent notion\nin Strong's head that something was wrong.\n\nThe young captain turned and walked the deck of the huge empty ship,\nstill deep in thought. He considered the fact that no reports had come\nthrough to the Academy from the colony at all. Not merely from the Space\nCadets, but from the expedition itself. Only the sketchiest details had\nbeen audioed back during the trip and absolutely nothing since their\nscheduled arrival on the satellite. A sudden cold wave of fear gripped\nthe space officer. He wondered if they had arrived safely!\n\nHe shook off the horrible thought. There must be a simple, logical\nexplanation for it all. Establishing a star colony was no easy matter.\nCommunications could be easily disrupted for any number of reasons.\n\nStrong forced himself to forget it. It was still a long way to the\nsatellite and there was no point in worrying about a fact until it was\nestablished to be a fact. He stretched out on a bunk and moments later\nwas asleep, while the giant ship hurtled through the dark void toward\nits destination with a thousand electronic hands and eyes to guide it\nsafely across the immense gulf of space.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 15\n\n\n\"Is he still out there?\" Tom whispered.\n\n\"Yeah,\" growled Astro. \"He hasn't moved.\"\n\n\"They're not taking any chances,\" said Roger. \"When they change the\nguard, they take out their ray guns, just in case.\"\n\nThe three cadets were crowded around the door of their quarters with\nAstro down on his hands and knees, trying to see through a small crack.\nThe big cadet straightened up and shook his head.\n\n\"I guess it's useless,\" he sighed. \"Vidac is making sure we stay here.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Roger disgustedly, \"if we don't get out pretty soon, we\nwon't--\" He didn't finish the sentence. At that moment the door suddenly\nopened and Bush stepped in, two paralo-ray guns in his hands, cocked and\nready to fire. Behind him was Hyram Logan and his daughter, Jane.\n\n\"You got ten minutes,\" said Bush, \"and one funny move out of any of you\nand I'll blast you silly.\"\n\nHe closed the door and the click of the lock could be heard ominously.\n\n\"Mr. Logan!\" exclaimed Tom. \"How'd you manage to get in here?\"\n\n\"Sonny,\" replied the Venusian farmer, \"when you're dealing with crooks,\nyou have to act like a crook!\" He smiled and added, \"I bought my way in\nhere!\"\n\n\"You mean that Vidac doesn't know you're here?\" asked Astro.\n\n\"No,\" said Jane. \"But we had to come. Vidac was going to--\" She stopped\nand turned to her father. \"Maybe you'd better tell them, Father.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Logan slowly, \"we just heard that Vidac is going to hold\ntrial for you three boys right here on Roald.\"\n\n\"Trial!\" exclaimed Astro.\n\n\"How'd you find that out?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"They called all the colonists together and gave us pieces of paper with\nnumbers on them,\" said Logan. \"Then they put all the numbers into a bowl\nand picked twelve of them out again. The people that held those numbers\nwere told that they were going to be the jury at your trial for the\nmurder of Professor Sykes!\"\n\n\"Murder?\" exclaimed Roger.\n\n\"Blast my jets!\" roared Astro. \"They can't do that! We're under Solar\nGuard jurisdiction!\"\n\n\"That's what I told them,\" snorted Logan. \"You see, my number was\npulled. I got up and opened my big mouth. I should have kept quiet and\nsat on the jury, and then had my say where it would have meant\nsomething!\"\n\n\"Then they took you off the jury?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"Yep,\" said Logan. \"Me and everyone else they thought might be\nprejudiced!\"\n\n\"We came to tell you,\" said Jane, \"because we wanted you to know what\nwas going on and to see if there was anything we could do to help.\"\n\n\"We already tried to help in a lot of ways,\" said Logan. \"We tried to\nget that space jerk outside to let you escape. I offered him--well, I\noffered him a lot, but he wouldn't do it.\"\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" asked Jane, looking at Tom.\n\n\"I don't know, Jane,\" said Tom. \"But we've certainly got to do\nsomething. If we ever stand trial here on Roald--\"\n\nTom was interrupted by a loud banging on the door, followed by the click\nof the lock. Then the door was opened and Bush stepped inside.\n\n\"All right, Logan,\" said Bush. \"Time's up!\"\n\n\"But--but,\" complained Logan, \"we've only been here two minutes!\"\n\n\"Time's up, I said,\" sneered Bush. He raised his ray guns threateningly.\n\n\"Well, I guess we'd better go,\" said Logan. He turned and shook hands\nwith each of the cadets. \"Good luck, boys,\" he said with a smile. \"Don't\nworry. We'll find someway of getting you out of this mess!\"\n\n\"Thanks for telling us, sir,\" said Tom.\n\n\"Telling you what?\" demanded Bush.\n\n\"That the world is round and that you're a square-headed space crawler,\"\nsaid Roger casually.\n\n\"A real big mouth, eh!\" snarled Bush. \"Why, I oughta--\" He raised his\nguns again, but just at the moment Jane walked into the line of fire and\nstood there quietly. Bush stepped back. It was just enough to break the\ntension.\n\n\"Go on!\" Bush growled. \"Get out of here!\"\n\n\"Don't get rough,\" said Logan, \"or I might tell your boss you took a\nbribe to let us see the cadets!\" With a parting wink at the boys, he\nfollowed Jane out.\n\nJust as Bush started to close the door, Tom stepped forward. \"How about\nsomething to eat,\" he demanded, \"and some story tapes to pass away the\ntime?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Roger, picking up Tom's cue, \"and we don't want anything\nyou'd select either. It might be too infantile! Send Jeff Marshall up\nhere so we can get what we want!\"\n\n\"I'll see about it,\" sneered Bush, slamming the door behind him.\n\n\"Are you thinking what I'm thinking?\" Roger asked Tom.\n\n\"Yes. If there is anyone we can trust, it's Jeff. Let's hope that space\njerk outside comes through!\"\n\n\"Well,\" growled Astro, \"if worse comes to worse, we can always jump\nhim.\"\n\n\"Uh--uh,\" said Tom, shaking his head. \"We wouldn't get past the first\ncorridor. If we escape, and we will, we've got to have help from someone\non the outside!\"\n\n\"But won't they be watching Jeff too?\" asked Astro.\n\n\"Sure they will, but we've got to take that chance. If Vidac holds us\nfor trial here on Roald, and we're convicted, the only place for a\nreview of the case will be the Solar Council Chamber back on Earth.\"\n\n\"Well, what's wrong with that?\" asked Astro.\n\n\"I'll tell you what's wrong with it,\" said Roger. \"Before the case would\ncome up for a review, we would have already spent at least two years on\na prison rock!\"\n\nMeanwhile, in his office in the Administration Building, Lieutenant\nGovernor Vidac listened with mounting apprehension to a report from the\ncommunications control officer of Roald.\n\n\"We just received a message from Captain Strong aboard the Solar Guard\ncruiser _Orion_ requesting landing data here on Roald,\" the voice\ncrackled impersonally over the teleceiver.\n\n\"How far out is he?\" asked Vidac, suddenly growing pale.\n\n\"He should arrive within four hours.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Vidac, regaining his composure. \"Give him all the\ninformation he needs.\"\n\n\"What about the instrument disturbance?\"\n\n\"Tell him everything.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied the control officer, and the teleceiver screen went\nblank.\n\nVidac got up and began to pace the floor, pondering the reasons for\nStrong's sudden unannounced visit. He could be coming to check on the\nSpace Cadets, he thought. Or it might be a routine check of the progress\nof the colony. Or he might know about the uranium. There had been an\ninvestigation of the soil on the satellite by the original expedition.\nBut if they had known anything about it, reasoned Vidac, it would have\nbeen claimed for the Solar Alliance.\n\nNo, Vidac shook his head. He's not here to investigate the uranium, he's\nhere either to check on the cadets or make a routine inspection of the\ncolony. And if it's the former, he'd give Strong enough proof to bury\nthe cadets on a prison rock for life.\n\nVidac turned to the teleceiver. \"Get the spaceport,\" he ordered. \"Tell\nthe spaceport officer to prepare a welcoming party to blast off in ten\nminutes. They will meet Captain Strong of the Solar Guard in the cruiser\n_Orion_. Communications control will give them his position.\" He flipped\noff the teleceiver and settled back in his chair, smiling. Nothing in\nthe world like a big fuss to throw a man off guard, he thought. And\nSteve Strong, as the first visitor from Earth since the colony was\nfounded, would get a tremendous welcome!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\" ... Are you sure?\" asked Tom, his face brightening. \"You heard it\nyourself?\"\n\nJeff Marshall smiled. \"Roald is going crazy. They're preparing the\nbiggest welcome for a spaceman since Jon Builker's return from his first\ntrip in space!\"\n\n\"Boy,\" said Astro, \"what a break!\" He slapped Roger on the back. \"We'll\nbe out of this can an hour after Captain Strong lands!\"\n\n\"I knew you wanted me to help you try to escape,\" said Jeff. \"I had\nalready begun to make plans.\"\n\n\"No need for that now,\" said Tom. \"If we tried to escape, we'd be doing\nthe very thing Vidac would want us to do. He could say it was an\nadmission of guilt.\"\n\nRoger agreed with a nod of his head. \"There's only one thing that\nbothers me now.\"\n\n\"What's that?\" asked Astro.\n\n\"Professor Sykes,\" he said. \"We've been so worried about our own necks,\nwe've forgotten about him.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Astro, \"what about him?\"\n\n\"What really happened to him,\" mused Roger, \"and why?\"\n\n\"I wish I knew,\" said Tom. \"But I'll bet Vidac knows.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" agreed Roger. \"But I still say why and what?\"\n\nThe blond-haired cadet looked around at the faces of his friends. There\nwas no reply to his question.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEvery citizen of Roald, man, woman, and child, was at the spaceport to\nwatch the giant cruiser _Orion_ settle slowly to the ground. Vidac\nwatched it through squinting eyes. He had secretly hoped that the\nuranium disturbances would cause the ship to crash, thus eliminating his\ndifficulties before they could begin, but he couldn't help admiring the\nway the big cruiser was handled. When the hatch opened and Captain\nStrong stepped out, resplendent in his black-and-gold uniform, there was\na spontaneous roar of welcome from the ground. Vidac stepped forward\nimmediately to greet the Solar Guard officer.\n\n\"I'm Paul Vidac, Captain Strong. Lieutenant governor of Roald. Governor\nHardy is very busy and asked me to welcome you and to convey his\napologies for not greeting you personally.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Strong and shook hands with Vidac. He turned around\nand looked over the crowd. \"But I seem to be missing several other\nwelcomers.\"\n\n\"Ah, I presume you mean the Space Cadets,\" stammered Vidac.\n\nStrong looked at the lieutenant governor. \"Yes, I mean the Space Cadets.\nWhere are they?\"\n\nVidac tried to meet Strong's level gaze, but his eyes fell away. \"They\nare under arrest!\" he said finally.\n\n\"Arrest!\" cried Strong. \"For what?\"\n\n\"The murder of Professor Sykes.\"\n\n\"Murder? Professor Sykes?\" asked Strong. \"Explain yourself!\"\n\n\"This is hardly the place to discuss it. Shall we go to my office?\"\nasked Vidac.\n\n\"Where is the professor's body?\" asked Strong.\n\n\"It hasn't been found yet,\" replied Vidac uneasily.\n\n\"Then how can the cadets be charged with murder if you can't produce a\nbody?\" demanded Strong.\n\nVidac paused a moment. He was thrown off guard by Strong's shrewd\nobservation. \"They are also being held for abduction of the professor,\"\nsaid Vidac. \"We have eyewitnesses.\"\n\n\"Take me to them,\" said Strong.\n\n\"I'm afraid that will be impossible at the moment,\" said Vidac. \"The\ncolonists are expecting a little show for their enthusiastic welcome.\"\n\n\"Take me to the cadets,\" Strong demanded. \"And that means immediately!\"\n\nVidac wavered under the Solar Guard captain's withering gaze. He nodded\nand turned away.\n\nAs Strong pushed through the crowd of welcoming colonists, someone\ntugged at his sleeve and whispered into his ear.\n\n\"Don't believe all you hear!\" Strong turned to see the face of Hyram\nLogan. Before he could reply, Logan disappeared into the crowd.\n\n\"Well, Captain Strong? Are you coming?\" asked Vidac.\n\nStrong turned and followed him through the crowd. He could feel danger\non this satellite. He could feel it and he could read it in the faces of\nthe people around him.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 16\n\n\n\"I'll leave you here,\" said Vidac to Captain Strong as the two spacemen\nstood in front of the Administration Building. \"Take the slidestairs up\nto the seventh floor. First corridor to the left. There will be a guard\noutside their door. Give him this note and there won't be any trouble.\"\n\nStrong looked at the lieutenant governor coolly. \"There better not be,\"\nhe said.\n\n\"That's a strange attitude to take, Captain,\" said Vidac.\n\n\"Vidac,\" said Strong coldly, \"I want you to know right now that I don't\nlike this setup. There are many things cadets might be, but they are not\nkidnappers or murderers!\"\n\n\"I intend to prove otherwise!\" asserted Vidac.\n\n\"I figured you would,\" said Strong, \"but you still have to produce\nProfessor Sykes's body.\"\n\n\"Don't worry, Captain.\" Vidac smiled. \"My men are searching for it now.\nWe'll find it.\"\n\n\"When you do, Vidac,\" said Strong grimly, \"and he happens to be alive,\nmake sure he stays that way, eh?\" The Solar Guard captain wheeled and\nentered the Administration Building before Vidac could answer.\n\nInside, he found the slidestairs and rode up to the seventh level.\nTaking the first corridor to the left, he rounded a corner to find Ed\nBush standing in front of the door to the cadets' quarters. As he\napproached, Bush took out his paralo-ray gun and held it on Strong.\n\n\"That's far enough, mister,\" said Bush.\n\n\"Do you realize what you're doing?\" demanded Strong.\n\n\"Never mind what I'm doing,\" snapped Bush. \"Who are you and what do you\nwant?\"\n\n\"You'd better get spacewise, mister! It's against the law to hold a\nweapon on an officer of the Solar Guard! I'm Captain Strong and I want\nto see the cadets!\"\n\n\"No one gets inside without a pass from Governor Vidac,\" Bush answered\nsurlily.\n\nStrong pulled out the note and handed it over brusquely. Bush glanced at\nit and handed it back.\n\n\"O.K.,\" he said. \"You got ten minutes.\" He unlocked the door and stepped\naside.\n\nStrong was furious at this treatment. But he held his temper in check,\nrealizing he had to talk to the cadets first and find out what had\nhappened. He would deal with Bush later. He stepped past Bush and opened\nthe door.\n\n\"_Polaris_ unit--stand to!\" he yelled.\n\nSeated around the table, the three cadets stared at their captain in\ndisbelief, then instinctively rose and snapped to attention. Their backs\nwere straight and their eyes forward, but it was impossible for them to\nkeep smiles off their faces. Suppressing his own elation, Strong managed\nto stride in front of them in mock inspection, but then could no longer\nhold back an answering smile.\n\n\"Unit--stand easy!\"\n\nLike three happy puppies the cadets swarmed over their skipper, pounding\nhim on the back, grabbing his hands, and mauling him until he had to cry\nout for peace.\n\n\"Take it easy,\" he cried. \"Relax, will you! You'll tear me apart!\"\n\n\"You're the happiest sight I've seen in weeks, sir!\" shouted Tom.\n\n\"Yeah,\" drawled Roger, grinning from ear to ear. \"I couldn't be happier\nif you had brought along a ship full of space dolls!\"\n\n\"When did you get here, sir?\" asked Astro. \"Why didn't you let us know?\"\n\nThe questions tumbled out of the boys' mouths thick and fast, and Strong\nlet them chatter until their initial burst of elation had worn itself\nout. Then, after quickly bringing them up to date on all news of the\nAcademy, and news of Earth, he pulled up a chair and faced them\nsolemnly. The three cadets braced themselves to tell him about their\nexperiences since leaving Atom City.\n\n\"There's a lot to tell, sir,\" began Tom. \"But we're only going to give\nyou the facts as we know them, sir. And then let you decide.\"\n\nThen starting from the beginning, when they were first relieved of their\nstations on the _Polaris_ on the way out to the satellite, the three\ncadets related their experiences with Vidac, Hardy, and Professor Sykes.\nThey ended with a detailed account of their being held for the\ndisappearance of the professor.\n\n\"And you say that the colonists were forced to pay for their food on the\ntrip out?\" asked Strong incredulously.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Tom. \"And later, after the ships crashed, there was a\nshortage of farm tools and equipment, which meant that the colonists\nwould have to farm with chemicals. Vidac made them sign over part of\ntheir future profits and mortgage their land holdings to get the\nchemicals.\"\n\n\"And four hundred ships crashed in landing? Hasn't anybody figured out\nwhy yet?\" Strong asked.\n\nRoger shook his head. \"The instruments just went out, sir,\" he said. \"I\nnever saw anything like it, and when the professor wanted to go down in\na jet boat first to investigate, Vidac insisted on taking the _Polaris_\ndown, anyway. He brought her in by the seat of his pants....\"\n\n\"Only because Tom took over when he got cold feet,\" chimed in Astro.\n\n\"Yeah,\" agreed Roger. \"But the others couldn't do it. They just splashed\nin.\"\n\n\"And there hasn't been any explanation of why the instruments went out?\"\n\n\"I haven't heard any, sir,\" said Astro. \"Professor Sykes started out\nright after we landed to investigate the satellite, but I never heard\nanything more about it. When I asked him one day if he had found\nanything, he told me to mind my own business.\"\n\n\"And now you're accused of abducting and murdering the professor,\" mused\nStrong.\n\n\"That's it, sir,\" said Tom. \"As I said, we didn't want to give you\nanything but the facts as we know them. There are a lot of incidents\nthat would show Vidac is trying to pull something funny, but nothing\nthat could be proved.\"\n\nStrong nodded. \"Well, it certainly looks as though Vidac is--\"\n\nStrong was suddenly interrupted by Bush who stepped into the room\narrogantly, paralo-ray gun in hand.\n\n\"Time's up!\" he yelled, waving the gun at Strong.\n\n\"I've warned you about holding a weapon on a Solar Guard officer,\"\nsnapped Strong, rising to face the man. \"Either put that thing away or\nuse it.\"\n\n[Illustration: _\"Hasn't anybody figured out why four hundred ships\ncrashed in landing?\" Strong asked._]\n\nBush glanced at the smiling cadets and turned back to Strong.\n\n\"Your time is up,\" he growled. \"Get out!\"\n\n\"I said,\" replied Strong coldly, \"either use that thing or put it away!\"\n\nBush glared at Strong, but the gun in his hand began to waver. \"I said\nyour time's up!\" he repeated, but there was considerably less conviction\nin his voice.\n\nSuddenly Strong stepped forward and grabbed the man's wrist, forcing the\ngun down. As Bush started to struggle, Strong tightened his grip, and\nthe victim's face grew white with pain. Slowly Bush's fingers opened and\nthe paralo-ray weapon dropped to the floor.\n\n\"Now pick it up and get out of here!\" barked Strong, releasing Bush's\narm. \"I'm going to stay with the cadets as long as I want. And if you\never pull a gun on me again, I'll make you eat it!\"\n\nHe turned his back to Bush and faced the cadets again. Bush dove for the\ngun, raised it threateningly, then suddenly walked out of the room,\nslamming the door as hard as he could. The cadets sighed in relief and\nStrong smiled.\n\n\"Let's see what Vidac makes of that,\" he said. \"Now, let's get down to\nbusiness. There's only one thing I can do right now.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir?\" asked Tom, waiting attentively.\n\n\"I'm going to talk with a few of the colonists and see what else I can\npick up. Meantime, you just take it easy. And if that space jerk outside\ngives you any trouble\"--Strong paused and smiled--\"show him a few of\nyour wrestling tricks, Astro.\"\n\nThe big Venusian nodded enthusiastically. \"My pleasure, Captain.\"\n\nStrong stood up and shook hands with each of them. \"From what you've\ntold me,\" he said, \"I think I should see Hyram Logan first.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Tom. \"He's sort of the spokesman for the rest of the\ncolonists. He can give you a lot of information.\"\n\n\"Good!\" said Strong. \"Where will I find him?\"\n\nTom gave directions and the captain left the three cadets with a smile.\n\"Don't worry. We'll see this through. In a short while you'll be on duty\nagain.\"\n\nA half-hour later, in one of the converted jet boats, Steve Strong sped\nalong the smooth broad streets and flat level highways of the colony. He\nwas heading for the Logan farm and the long drive through the Roald\ncountryside would ordinarily have been interesting and enjoyable. But\nthe Solar Guard captain was preoccupied with his own thoughts. A name\nkept repeating itself over and over in his mind. Hardy--Hardy--Hardy.\nWhy hadn't the governor done something about Vidac? Where was he when\nthe colonists were forced to pay for their food? Why hadn't he checked\non the cadets' statement that their report hadn't been sent out? Strong\nmade a mental note to check the logbook of the _Polaris_ when he\nreturned.\n\nSuddenly, ahead of him, he saw a young boy walking along the highway. He\nslowed down and stopped beside him.\n\n\"Hello, Sonny,\" called Strong with a smile. \"Can you tell me where I can\nfind the Logan farm?\"\n\nThe boy stared at Strong, eyes wide. \"Sure thing, Mister, er--I\nmean--Captain. I'm Billy Logan.\"\n\n\"Well, hop in, Billy!\" said Strong. \"I'll give you a lift!\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" replied the boy and jumped in beside Strong. \"It's about a\nmile up the road, then we turn off.\" He couldn't keep his eyes off\nStrong's black-and-gold uniform. \"I'm going to be a Space Cadet when I\nget old enough,\" he gulped breathlessly.\n\n\"You are?\" asked Strong. \"That's fine. You have to study very hard.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Billy, \"I'm starting already! Tom, Roger, and Astro lent\nme books and study spools to work on. Why, I bet I know every single\nAcademy regulation right now!\"\n\nStrong laughed. \"I wouldn't be surprised!\"\n\n\"We turn off here,\" said Billy, indicating a narrow road branching off\nthe main highway. \"We live about three miles down. Out in the\nwilderness. By the stars, it's so lonely out here sometimes, I wish I\nwas back on Venus!\"\n\n\"If you want to be a spaceman,\" said Strong, \"you have to learn not to\nbe lonely. Why, I just made a trip out from Atom City all by myself.\nDidn't bother me a bit!\"\n\n\"You did?\" cried Billy. \"Gosh!\"\n\nHe was so awed by Strong's solo trip out to the satellite that he\nremained silent the rest of the trip.\n\nA few moments later Strong pulled up at a small crystal structure, just\noff the road. He had no sooner stopped, than Billy was out of the car\nyelling to his father and sister at the top of his voice that they had a\nvisitor.\n\nHyram Logan came from around the back of the house to greet Strong, and\nJane, who had been busy in the kitchen preparing supper, came to meet\nthe young officer, wiping her hands on her apron.\n\n\"Mighty glad to see the Solar Guard remembered we're out here,\" said\nLogan as he led Strong into the house. Seated comfortably in the living\nroom, Strong brought up the purpose of his visit right away.\n\n\"I've just finished talking to the cadets, Mr. Logan, and they've been\ntelling me some strange stories about Vidac and Governor Hardy. I'd like\nto hear what you have to say about it.\"\n\n\"I can say everything in one sentence, Captain,\" snorted Logan. \"Those\nspace crawlers are trying to take everything we have away from us!\"\n\nAnd for three hours Strong listened as the Venusian farmer talked. When\nthe farmer had finished, Strong asked only one question.\n\n\"Why didn't Governor Hardy do something?\"\n\n\"I can't explain that,\" said Logan. \"When we were forced to pay for our\nfood on the way out, we signed a petition and sent it to the governor.\nBut we never heard anything about it. Of course Vidac could have\nintercepted it.\"\n\n\"Well, thank you, Mr. Logan,\" said Strong, getting up.\n\n\"Won't you stay for supper, Captain?\" asked Jane.\n\n\"Yeah, please stay, sir,\" pleaded Billy. \"I'd like to hear about your\ntrip out here all by yourself.\"\n\nStrong laughed. \"Some other time, Billy.\" He ruffled the lad's hair. \"I\nhave to get back and see if the cadets are all right.\"\n\nA few moments later Strong was speeding along the superhighway back\ntoward the city. There was only one thing on his mind--to get the cadets\nout of the trap they were in. But it would be a hard job. Vidac had\nwitnesses against them. He mentally probed the situation further. Why\nwould Vidac abduct Professor Sykes? Surely not to frame the cadets. He\nmust have wanted to be rid of Sykes too. Sykes must have known\nsomething. But what? Strong suddenly thought of the professor's\ninvestigation of the landing disturbance. It could only have been the\nresult of radioactivity in a large mass. So the professor must have\ndiscovered a large deposit of uranium. Strong's mind raced on. Sykes\nwould have taken the report to Vidac or Hardy, or both, and--\n\nStrong forced himself to stop thinking. He was violating one of the\ncardinal laws of the Solar Alliance. He was presuming that Vidac or\nHardy was guilty--and he didn't have an atom's worth of proof. There was\nonly one way to get the proof. The cadets would have to escape to find\nit.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nStrong sidled around the corner of the corridor. Down at the end of the\nhall, still standing in front of the cadet's door, Bush leaned against\nthe wall, idly picking his teeth. Strong realized that he would have to\nsneak up behind the guard. He couldn't afford to be seen. He had to wait\nuntil Bush turned around.\n\nHe waited and watched while the man shifted from one foot to the other.\nAnd after what seemed like hours, Bush shifted his position and turned\nhis back on the Solar Guard officer. Strong quickly darted around the\ncorner and ran lightly down the hall. If Bush turned around now, Strong\nwould be frozen stiff by the paralo ray. With ten feet to go, the\ncaptain lunged at Bush in a diving tackle, sending the man sprawling\nface forward. In a flash he was on top of him, and with a quick snapping\nblow on the back of the neck he knocked the man cold.\n\nStrong snatched up the paralo-ray gun, then unlocked the door and threw\nit open. The cadets were sprawled on their bunks, listening to a story\nspool.\n\n\"Captain Strong!\" yelled Tom.\n\n\"Quiet!\" ordered Strong. \"You've got three minutes. You'll find a jet\ncar at the side entrance of the building. I can't explain now, but get\nout of here!\"\n\n\"But what do you want us to do?\" asked Tom. The three cadets were\nalready grabbing their clothes and other items they would need.\n\n\"The only way you're going to prove that you didn't abduct or murder the\nprofessor is to find him,\" said Strong. \"And pray to your stars that\nhe's still alive. If he isn't, it'll be up to you to find out who killed\nhim!\"\n\n\"But what about you, sir?\" asked Roger. \"Won't Vidac know that you\nhelped us?\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly,\" said Strong. \"After what I said to the guard today, Vidac\nwill arrange for a hundred witnesses to prove that I helped you escape.\nYou'll have to bring back the professor, not only to save your own\nnecks, but my neck as well.\"\n\nThe three cadets nodded.\n\n\"All right,\" said Strong. \"Spaceman's luck, and remember, you'll be\nwanted criminals when you walk out of that door. So act like criminals.\nFight them the same way they will fight you. This is not a space\nmaneuver. It's your lives against theirs!\"\n\nWithout another word, the three cadets slipped out of the room and\ndisappeared down the corridor.\n\nStrong took a last look at Bush lying unconscious on the floor and\nhurried silently back to the front of the building. His heart was racing\nwith excitement. The ball had begun to roll.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 17\n\n\n\"Where do we cut off?\" asked Vidac. He sat beside Winters in the\nconverted jet boat, speeding down the smooth highway that Strong had\npassed over only a few minutes before.\n\n\"It's right along here, somewhere,\" said Winters.\n\n\"Better slow down,\" said Vidac. \"We don't want to miss it. We haven't\nmuch time. If Strong starts nosing around he might discover something.\"\n\n\"Lucky for us we found out so quickly where the uranium is,\" replied\nWinters.\n\n\"It won't mean a thing unless we can get Logan to sign over his land\nholdings.\"\n\nWinters braked the jet car suddenly, throwing Vidac up against the\nwindshield. \"What are you doing?\" snapped Vidac.\n\n\"Sorry, boss,\" replied Winters. \"There's the road leading to the Logan\nplace up ahead.\"\n\nWinters slowed for the turn off the main highway and then accelerated to\nfull power again on the side road.\n\n\"How are you going to get old Logan to sign the release?\" asked Winters.\n\"Suppose he knows his land is worth about ten billion credits?\"\n\n\"How could he know?\" asked Vidac. \"The only ones that know are me, you,\nBush, and Sykes.\"\n\nWinters nodded. \"Then as soon as we get Logan to sign over the land, we\ntake care of Sykes, bring back his body as proof against the cadets, and\neverything's set, eh?\"\n\n\"Something like that,\" said Vidac. \"We still have to watch our step with\nStrong, though,\" said Vidac.\n\nThe two men were silent as the jet car raced down the side road. A\nmoment later they could see the lights in the small crystal farmhouse.\n\n\"Cut your lights,\" said Vidac. \"We don't want to scare them.\"\n\n\"O.K.,\" replied Winters. He switched off the powerful beams and slowed\nthe car to a crawl. They rolled past the outer farm buildings and came\nto a stop in front of the main house.\n\n\"Say, boss,\" said Winters suddenly. \"Look! Tracks in the road! Car\ntracks! Somebody's been out here! Logan doesn't have a car!\"\n\n\"So what?\" snarled Vidac. \"Get hold of yourself. It could have been\nanyone.\"\n\nA powerful light from the farmhouse suddenly flooded them and Logan's\nvoice cracked in the night air.\n\n\"Who's there?\" called the farmer.\n\n\"Good evening, Mr. Logan,\" said Vidac, climbing out of the car. \"This is\nthe governor.\"\n\n\"Vidac!\" said Logan, startled. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\"This is what we want!\" snarled Winters, whipping his ray gun into view.\n\"Get back inside!\"\n\n\"Wha--?\" gasped Logan. \"What's the meaning of this?\"\n\n\"You'd better do as the man says, Mr. Logan,\" said Vidac.\n\nJane suddenly appeared behind Logan, her hands still soapy from washing\nthe supper dishes. \"Who is it, Father?\" she asked, and then seeing Vidac\nand Winters she stepped back inside the house.\n\n\"Nothing to get alarmed about,\" said Vidac, pushing Logan into the house\nbefore him. \"We just want to have a little talk.\" He smiled. \"Business\ntalk.\"\n\n\"Isn't it too bad, Winters,\" said Vidac, \"that we just missed supper?\"\n\n\"What do you want?\" demanded Logan belligerently. He stepped in front of\nJane protectively.\n\n\"Now don't get excited Mr. Logan,\" said Vidac, his voice smooth. \"We\njust want you to sign a little paper, that's all.\"\n\n\"What kind of paper?\" asked Logan.\n\n\"Say,\" said Winters suddenly, \"ain't you got a kid?\"\n\n\"If you mean my son, Billy,\" said Logan, \"he's asleep.\"\n\n\"I'd better check,\" said Winters, starting forward.\n\n\"Never mind him,\" said Vidac. \"We haven't got all night and there's\nnothing a kid could do.\"\n\nHe pulled out a paper from his pocket and unfolded it, keeping his eyes\non Logan. \"Mr. Logan, we're going to foreclose your mortgage.\"\n\n\"Foreclose!\" gasped Logan. \"But--but I haven't even had time to gather\nin my first crop!\"\n\n\"We've taken a look at your fields and we don't think you're doing a\ngood job,\" said Vidac. \"In this mortgage you signed there's a clause\nthat states I can foreclose any time I want.\"\n\n\"But how can you judge a crop by just looking at the fields?\" asked\nJane.\n\n\"Oh, we have ways, Miss Logan.\" Vidac smiled. He walked to a near-by\ntable, and pushing a stack of study spools to the floor, spread the\npaper in front of him. He looked up at Logan and indicated the paper.\n\"Do you have a pen, or would you like to use mine?\"\n\n\"I'm not signing anything until I read it,\" snapped Logan.\n\nVidac smiled and pushed the paper across the table. Logan came forward\nand picked it up. He scanned it hurriedly and then glared at Vidac.\n\n\"You can't do this!\" he snapped. \"I won't sign!\"\n\nWinters suddenly leaped across the room and grabbed Jane by the wrist,\njamming his gun in her back.\n\nVidac leered at the farmer. \"Have you ever been frozen by a ray gun, Mr.\nLogan?\"\n\nLogan shook his head.\n\n\"Let me tell you about it,\" said Vidac coolly. \"The effects are very\nsimple, but very powerful. You are paralyzed! You can still see, hear,\nthink, and breathe. Your heart continues to beat, but otherwise, you are\nabsolutely powerless. The aftereffects are even worse. The person who\nhas been frozen comes out completely whole, but\"--Vidac suddenly\nshuddered--\"believe me, Mr. Logan, you feel like ten thousand bells were\nvibrating in your brain at one time. It isn't pleasant!\"\n\n\"Why--why--are you telling me this?\" asked Logan.\n\n\"You wouldn't want to see your daughter undergo such an experience,\nwould you?\"\n\n\"If--if I sign the paper,\" stammered Logan, \"will you leave Jane alone?\"\n\n\"I give you my word as a spaceman that nothing will happen to her. In\nfact, when you sign, you will continue to work the farm as before. Only\nyou'll be working for me. I wouldn't want to deprive you of your\nlivelihood.\"\n\nSuddenly the door to the bedroom opened and young Billy burst into the\nroom, clad only in his pajamas.\n\n\"Don't sign, Pa!\" he screamed. \"Wait and tell Captain Strong first!\"\n\n\"Strong!\" exclaimed Vidac. \"Has he been here?\"\n\nLogan nodded his head, and taking Vidac's pen, started to sign the\npaper.\n\n\"No--no, don't, Pa!\" cried Billy. \"Don't--!\"\n\nLogan paid no attention and finished signing. A look of deep hurt filled\nthe boy's eyes. \"A--a spaceman--\" he stammered, \"a Solar Guardsman would\nnever have given up!\" Crying, he turned away and buried his head in his\nsister's arms. Logan silently gave Vidac the paper and turned away.\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. Logan,\" said Vidac with a smile. \"That's all. Good\nnight!\" He turned and motioned for Winters to follow him. \"Come on.\nLet's get back to the city!\"\n\nBilly, Jane, and their father silently watched the two men leave the\nhouse. Even as the roar of the super-charged jet car faded away in the\ndistance, they still stood in silence.\n\nFinally Logan turned to his son and daughter. \"There ain't but one thing\nleft to do. Go back to Venus as soon as we can get passage. I'm sorry,\nBilly, but--\"\n\n\"That's all right, Pa,\" said Billy. \"I guess I would have done the same\nthing--for Jane.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Can't you get any more out of this jalopy?\" asked Roger.\n\nAstro shook his head. \"I've got her wide open now!\"\n\nThe big cadet sat hunched over the steering wheel of the small jet car\nStrong had used a short time before, racing along the same smooth\nhighway toward the spaceport on the other side of the hills. Tom was\nwedged in between Astro and Roger, his eyes straight ahead on the road.\n\n\"Where do we start first?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"We've got to get a ship. The _Polaris_, if possible. We can't begin to\nlook for the professor without one. As soon as Vidac learns that we've\nescaped, the whole satellite will be crawling with colonists and his\nboys, looking for us.\"\n\n[Illustration: _\"We better take it easy, Astro,\" said Tom. \"Turn off the\nlights.\"_]\n\n\"Colonists!\" cried Astro. \"Why would they want to help him?\"\n\n\"Vidac will think of something to convince them that we're dangerous\ncriminals,\" said Roger grimly. \"Tom's right. We've got to get the\n_Polaris_.\"\n\nThey were just leaving the crystal city behind them and winding through\nthe hill section surrounding the flat plain. Astro's handling of the jet\ncar was perfect as he took the curves in the road at full throttle. They\nstill had a long way to go to reach the spaceport that had been built on\nthe other side of the hills.\n\n\"You sure did a fine job of conversion on these jet boats,\" said Tom to\nAstro. \"This baby feels as though she was going to take off.\"\n\n\"I wish it was,\" said Roger, looking up at the hills on either side of\nthem. \"It would be a lot easier to blast over these things than go\nthrough them.\"\n\nThe car sped up to the last summit that separated them from the\nspaceport.\n\n\"We'd better take it easy,\" said Tom. \"Turn off the lights, Astro. We'll\nditch this jet car about a mile from the spaceport and walk the rest of\nthe way.\"\n\n\"Right,\" said Astro. He gunned the little vehicle for the last burst of\nspeed necessary to take them over the top. The jet car shuddered under\nthe extra power and a moment later the spaceport lay spread before them.\nBelow them, in a five-mile circle, they could see the few remaining\nships of the great fleet. The _Polaris_ was easily recognized, and\nfortunately, was on the nearer side of the giant landing area.\n\n\"There's home,\" said Roger.\n\n\"Yes,\" agreed Tom. \"And she sure looks good to me--\"\n\nThe curly-haired cadet suddenly stopped as powerful headlights loomed on\nthe highway ahead.\n\n\"That's Vidac's jet car,\" said Roger. \"I recognize the lights. We've got\nto get out of here!\"\n\nAstro braked the small vehicle and it screamed to a stop. The three\ncadets hastily piled out and raced for the darkness of the surrounding\nhills.\n\nNo sooner had they disappeared than Vidac's jet car slammed to a stop\nbeside the deserted jet car. In a flash Vidac was out of the seat and\nexamining the vehicle. He turned to Winters, holding a small disk in his\nhand. \"Tom Corbett's identification tag!\" said Vidac. \"The cadets have\nescaped! Organize a search! The orders are _shoot to kill!_\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 18\n\n\nGovernor Hardy was not to be found. Strong made inquiries around the\nAdministration Building and among the colonists but he could find no\ntrace of the governor. The only thing Strong learned was that Hardy had\nspent the last two weeks wandering around in the outlying wilderness\nareas of the satellite, alone, apparently searching for something. But\nthe Solar Guard captain realized that it would be a waste of time to\nrace around the planet searching aimlessly for the governor. He became\nmore and more convinced that Hardy was hiding. His suspicions were\nincreased when he found Vidac waiting for him in the deserted lobby of\nthe Administration Building with a warrant for his arrest. The warrant\nhad been signed by Hardy.\n\n\"Before I place myself in your hands,\" said Strong, \"I want to see the\ngovernor.\"\n\n\"Considering that you committed a crime by aiding the escape of the\nSpace Cadets,\" said Vidac, \"that will not be possible.\"\n\n\"I demand to see the governor!\"\n\nVidac turned to Winters who was standing by his side. \"Take him,\" he\nordered.\n\nWinters whipped out his paralo-ray gun, and before he could move, a\nparalyzing charge froze the Solar Guard captain in his tracks.\n\n\"Take him to my quarters,\" said Vidac. \"And stay with him. I'm going to\norganize a searching party and find those cadets.\"\n\n\"Right,\" said Winters.\n\nAs Vidac walked away, Winters picked up the paralyzed body of the Solar\nGuard officer and carried him awkwardly to the slidestairs. Though under\nthe effects of the paralo-ray, Strong's mind still continued to\nfunction. Even as Winters carried him across his shoulder like a stick\nof wood, Strong was planning his escape. He figured Winters would\nrelease him from the ray charge once inside Vidac's quarters and he was\nready to go into action.\n\nWinters opened the panel to Vidac's spacious office and carried Strong\nthrough to the other side where the lieutenant governor's sleeping\nquarters were located. He put the helpless man down on the bed, and\nstepping back to the panel, flipped on the neutralizer of the ray gun.\nHe fired, releasing Strong from the frozen suspension.\n\nStrong felt the jolts of the neutralizer charge but he clamped his teeth\ntogether to keep them from chattering and stayed rigid. He had to remain\nstill, as if the neutralizer charge had not released him, in order to\nmake his plan work. Winters waited for Strong to move, and when he\ndidn't, stepped closer, prodding him with the barrel of the gun. In a\nflash Strong leaped up and grabbed the ray gun. Twisting it out of the\nsurprised man's hand, he brought the weapon down on the man's neck.\nWinters dropped to the floor like a stone.\n\nThen Strong scrambled to his feet and cold-bloodedly turned the ray on\nWinters, blasting him into immobility. He turned grimly toward the panel\nand raced to the slidestairs. If Vidac had a warrant for his arrest,\nsigned by Hardy, then Vidac knew where Hardy was. If he could follow the\nlieutenant governor, he might possibly learn just where the mystery of\nRoald began and who was after what and why.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter leaving the jet car and climbing into the desolate hills\nsurrounding Roald City, Tom, Roger, and Astro watched from the safety of\na ridge the quick search Vidac and Winters had made to find them. When\nthe two men had returned to the superhighway and blasted back toward the\ncity, taking both jet cars, the three boys made their way slowly through\nthe night down the opposite side of the hills and headed for the Logan\nfarm. When the sun star rose over the satellite's horizon, the three\nboys were stretched out flat on their stomachs in a field, watching the\nmorning activity of Jane, Billy, and Hyram Logan about the farm.\n\n\"Think we can get them to help us?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"It's the only thing we can do,\" said Astro. \"If they won't, we might as\nwell give ourselves up. I'm so hungry I could eat a whole cow!\"\n\n\"What kind of a cow?\" asked Roger. \"There aren't any on Roald, remember?\nWe drink synthetic milk.\"\n\n\"I could even eat a synthetic cow!\" was Astro's grim rejoinder.\n\n\"Come on, you two,\" said Tom. \"We might as well try it. You think\nthey're alone?\"\n\n\"They don't act as though there's anyone around but themselves,\" said\nRoger. \"But I don't know--\"\n\n\"I thought I saw a curtain move at that window on the left a while ago,\"\ncommented Astro, \"and all three of them were outside.\"\n\n\"Probably a breeze,\" said Tom. \"You cut over to the right, Astro. I'll\ngo straight in, and you take the left, Roger. That way, if anything\ngoes wrong, one or two of us might get away.\"\n\n\"All set?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"Ready,\" nodded Astro.\n\n\"Let's go.\"\n\nThe three boys separated, and a moment later, when his unit mates were\nin position, Tom stood up and walked across the clearing, exposing\nhimself to the house. Out of the corner of his eye he saw Astro and\nRoger moving in on the left and right. Billy was working in the front\nyard with his father, mixing chemicals. Jane was standing by the doorway\nof the house digging in a bed of flowers. Tom continued to walk right\nthrough the front yard and was only ten feet away from Billy before the\nyoungster looked up.\n\n\"Tom!\"\n\nLogan turned and saw the cadet walking toward him. He stared. After a\nnight scrambling around the hills, Tom looked as if he had been\nshoveling coal.\n\n\"Hello, Mr. Logan,\" said Tom, looking around. \"Are you alone?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Logan replied. \"Where are the other boys?\"\n\n\"They're coming,\" said Tom, waving his arm toward his friends.\n\nAstro and Roger rose from their places of concealment and darted\nforward.\n\n\"Get in the house, quick!\" ordered Logan. \"Vidac and his flunky Winters\nwere out here last night and--\" He didn't finish. The unmistakable roar\nof a jet car approaching rapidly was heard. The cadets raced for the\nhouse, following Jane into the farmer's bedroom, where they hid in a\ncloset. Jane returned to the front of the house and stood with her\nfather and Billy to watch the cloud of dust kicked up by the jet car as\nit raced along the dirt road toward them.\n\n\"If it's them space crawlers again,\" said Logan to his children, \"let me\ndo the talking.\"\n\n\"Who else could it be?\" asked Jane.\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Logan. \"But remember, if it is Vidac, we might be\nthe only thing between those three boys inside and a long term on a\nprison rock!\"\n\nThe jet car entered the cleared area in front of the house and stopped\nin a cloud of dust. Logan, grim-faced, followed by Billy and Jane walked\nacross the yard to the car and waited. The door opened and a man in the\nuniform of an enlisted spaceman climbed out.\n\n\"Jeff Marshall!\" yelled Billy.\n\n\"Hello, Mr. Logan, Jane, Billy.\" Jeff noticed the sudden look of relief\nthat passed over Logan's face. \"Is there something wrong?\"\n\n\"Not a thing, Jeff,\" said Logan. \"Come on in the house. We've got a\nsurprise for you.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said Jeff. \"But I'm afraid I'm not in the mood for\nsurprises. The cadets have escaped and the whole countryside is crawling\nwith Vidac's men looking for them. There's a reward of a thousand\ncredits for their capture--dead or alive!\"\n\nLogan patted the sergeant on the shoulder. \"Stop worrying, Jeff. The\ncadets are in the house.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nLogan nodded his head. \"Come on inside.\" He paused and spoke to his son.\n\"Billy, you scoot down the road to the bend and watch the main highway.\nIf anyone turns off into our road, you let me know right away!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Billy and dashed down the road. Jeff followed Jane\nand Logan into the house, and a few moments later, after exchanging\nenthusiastic greetings, he and the cadets waited hungrily for Jane to\nprepare breakfast.\n\nFinishing the hearty meal in short order and sipping hot bracing coffee,\nthe three cadets took turns in telling Jeff of their conversations with\nStrong, their escape, and their near encounter with Vidac on the highway\nthe night before.\n\n\"What made you come out here, Jeff?\" Tom finally asked.\n\n\"Well, when I discovered that you had escaped, I knew you'd head for one\nof two places, the spaceport or here. I hung around the spaceport all\nnight waiting for you to show up, and when you didn't, I came here.\"\n\n\"That's dangerous,\" said Logan. \"If you figured it that way, Vidac can\ndo the same thing. I wouldn't want him to find you boys here. Not that I\ndon't want to help you, but Vidac might try to connect me with you and\nthe missing professor. I couldn't take a risk like that with Billy and\nJane. We're in enough trouble.\"\n\nThe farmer then told them how Vidac had forced him to sign a release on\nhis land while threatening Jane with a ray gun.\n\n\"We have to get to the bottom of this mess,\" said Tom. \"The only trouble\nis we don't know what he's after or why he's trying to frame us.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Roger, glancing at his watch, \"whatever we decide, we'd\nbetter do it quickly. It's almost noon.\"\n\n\"Noon!\" exclaimed Logan. \"Why it can't be more than nine at the most!\"\nHe pulled out a large gold watch from his coverall pocket. \"Sure--it's a\nquarter to nine!\"\n\nJeff looked at his watch. \"Same here!\" He smiled. \"You must be wrong,\nRoger.\"\n\n\"You probably forgot to wind it,\" said Tom. He glanced casually at his\nown watch and suddenly exclaimed. \"Say, my watch has three-thirty!\"\n\n\"And mine says four twenty-two!\" cried Astro.\n\nRoger and Tom looked at each other, eyes widening.\n\n\"You don't think--?\" began Tom, hardly daring to breathe.\n\n\"Yes, I do!\" said Roger. \"Remember what happened to the instruments?\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Uranium!\" exclaimed Astro.\n\nThe word echoed in the kitchen like the blast of a bomb. The boys looked\nat each other, too startled to explain to Logan and Jane, who, though\nthey were listening intently, were unable to fathom the boys' reasoning.\n\n\"Where were you last night?\" asked Jeff quickly.\n\nRoger described as nearly as he could remember the exact route that they\nhad traveled in making their way to the Logan farm.\n\n\"Hey, I think I've got the answer, fellows!\" Tom suddenly exclaimed.\n\"If Vidac came out here last night and took over Mr. Logan's farm, and\nwe're falsely accused of getting rid of the professor, and the professor\nis missing, there must be something to tie it all together. Vidac\nwouldn't do the things he's done, unless he's got a rocket-blasting good\nreason!\"\n\nRoger quickly added, \"And he wouldn't try to buck Captain Strong unless\nhe was playing for high stakes!\"\n\n\"Right,\" said Tom. \"The only thing that could have caused our watches to\ngo haywire, like the ships instruments, would be uranium. Lots of\nuranium. And uranium is the only thing valuable enough to make Vidac\ntake such long chances.\"\n\n\"But how can you tell it's uranium?\" asked Logan.\n\n\"Our watches are not ordinary timepieces, sir,\" explained Tom. \"They are\nspecially constructed for use in space travel. Each watch is\nelectrically controlled and highly sensitive.\"\n\n\"Electric?\" repeated Logan in amazement. \"Electric wrist watches? That\nsmall thing?\"\n\nTom smiled. \"Each is charged by a miniature power pack, sir.\"\n\n\"The uranium deposits out in the hills affected these watches,\"\ncontinued Astro, \"the same way they affected the electronic instruments\non the spaceships coming in to Roald.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what,\" said Jeff. \"I'll make a check.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" said Logan. \"I just remembered something--\"\n\n\"What, sir?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"Professor Sykes! He was out here poking around in my fields and up in\nthe hills from dawn till dark. Said he was making some soil tests. I\nyelled at him for stepping all over some baby fruit trees.\"\n\n\"That's it, then,\" said Roger grimly. \"This area is jumping with\nuranium and Vidac now has title to the land!\"\n\n\"Don't be so sure,\" said Tom. \"We still need proof.\"\n\n\"Isn't using force to take the land away proof enough?\" snapped Logan.\n\n\"Wait a minute!\" said Jeff. \"If you want proof, I know where to get it.\"\n\n\"Where?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"The professor's work journal!\"\n\n\"Think he'd record it in there?\" asked Tom. \"It's pretty valuable\ninformation.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Jeff. \"He even logs the amount of coffee he drinks in the\nmorning! He puts down everything!\"\n\n\"You think the journal is still in the lab?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"Sure it is. I saw it before I left.\"\n\n\"Then we've got Vidac right where we want him!\" exclaimed Roger.\n\n\"No, we haven't,\" said Tom. \"We haven't got the professor to prove it!\nVidac's still the boss on this hunk of space rock, and we're still\nwanted for murder!\"\n\nThe door burst open and Billy raced into the room. \"A jet car just\nturned off the highway! It's coming here!\"\n\n\"We've got to get out of here!\" said Tom. He turned to Jeff. \"If it's\nVidac, tell him you've come to take Jane out on a date. That should\nexplain your presence. Then get the professor's journal and give it to\nCaptain Strong. He'll know what to do!\"\n\nRoger and Astro were cramming food in their pockets. \"Come on, Tom,\"\nsaid Roger. \"I can hear the jets.\"\n\n\"What are you boys going to do?\" asked Jane.\n\n\"Try to get to the _Polaris_,\" replied Tom. \"Then we'll hunt for the\nprofessor. If we don't find him, we're sunk. He's the key to the whole\nthing.\"\n\nAstro and Roger had tumbled out the window and were racing toward the\nsafety of the near-by hills. Tom gave Jeff a final handshake and dived\nout the window after them. Running toward the clump of bushes where\nAstro and Roger had just disappeared, he dived for cover, just as\nVidac's car roared into the clearing. The boys saw Vidac and Bush get\nout of the car, and after inspecting Jeff's, turn and stride into the\nhouse.\n\n\"Come on,\" said Tom. \"We've got to get to the _Polaris!_\"\n\nThe three boys turned away and hurried from the farm. In a few minutes,\nafter scrambling to the top of the nearest hill, they turned back to\nlook down on the farmhouse and saw Jeff escorting Jane to his car.\n\n\"So far so good,\" said Tom. \"Let's go.\"\n\nThey walked off and were soon lost in the tangle of scrub grass and dry\ngullies, their destination the _Polaris_ and the solution to the mystery\nof Professor Sykes's disappearance.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 19\n\n\nStrong's plan to follow Vidac in order to locate Hardy had paid off.\nWhile Vidac and Bush were rounding up citizens of Roald City and sending\nthem out to search for the Space Cadets, the Solar Guard captain had\nchecked the frequency setting on the communicator in the lieutenant\ngovernor's jet car. Then hiding in Professor Sykes's laboratory, Strong\ntuned the lab communicator to the same frequency and waited. He knew he\nwas taking a chance. Vidac might not contact the governor on that\nsetting if he contacted the governor at all, but there was no other way\nat the moment. Strong waited three hours before hearing the click of\nVidac's communicator on the laboratory speaker.\n\n\"Able One to Able Two. Can you hear me, Able Two? Come in, Able Two!\"\nVidac's voice crackled through the set.\n\nStrong listened intently and was rewarded by the sound of another click\nand another voice speaking.\n\n\"Able Two to Able One. Come in.\"\n\n\"I've got Strong,\" reported Vidac, \"and the cadets are somewhere in the\nhills between here and the spaceport. I've just organized the colonists\ninto searching parties and am about to leave.\"\n\n\"Good. Contact me the minute you find them.\"\n\n\"Right. Keep an eye out for them. They might try to reach the\nspaceport.\"\n\n\"Very well. I've set up an alarm on the outer hatch. No one can get\naboard without my knowing it.\"\n\n\"Right. Able One out.\"\n\n\"Able Two out.\"\n\nStrong heard the clicks of the two communicators and sat back, breathing\nhard. He had recognized the voice of Able Two instantly. It was Governor\nHardy. He was at the spaceport, hiding aboard a spaceship. But why?\nCould he be mixed up in this affair?\n\nPacing the floor restlessly, Strong tried to figure out the connection.\nHardy's reputation was spotless. It seemed inconceivable that he could\nbe involved with Vidac. And yet Hardy had selected Vidac as his\nright-hand man. And Vidac couldn't have gotten away with his treatment\nof the colonists unless Hardy had silently endorsed his orders.\n\nThe Solar Guard captain left the laboratory and watched the colonists as\nthey milled around in front of the Administration Building. Vidac's jet\ncar was in the middle of the group of men and Strong saw him jump up on\ntop of the car and begin addressing them. He couldn't hear the\nlieutenant governor's words, but he knew the men were being urged to\nhunt the cadets down like common criminals. He watched until Vidac\nrocketed off in his jet car, followed by a stream of colonists in\nvarious types of vehicles. In a few moments the area in front of the\nAdministration Building was quiet and deserted. Strong began searching\nfor a jet car.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJeff Marshall turned sideways in his seat and looked at the pretty face\nof Jane Logan. Her brow was furrowed with worry.\n\n\"Are you afraid?\" asked Jeff as he guided the car down the private road\nleading to the highway.\n\n\"I'm frightened to death!\" murmured Jane. \"That man Vidac is so\nruthless!\"\n\nJeff grunted. \"I have to agree with you there. But Tom is right. We need\nproof before we can stop him.\"\n\nThe girl shrank back. As far as one could see, the road was lined with\njet cars. Colonists with paralo-ray guns and anything that could be used\nas a weapon were scrambling around in the hills.\n\n\"What does it mean?\" asked Jane.\n\n\"I don't know,\" replied Jeff. \"But I think it's a search for the\ncadets!\"\n\n\"Oh, no!\" cried Jane.\n\n\"I hope they'll let us through,\" said Jeff. He pressed down on the\naccelerator and started moving along the line of cars. On either side of\nthe highway, he saw colonists beating the bushes, looking behind rocks\nand boulders, shouting at each other as they pressed their hunt for\nAstro, Tom, and Roger. Jeff managed to get halfway past the line of cars\nwhen ahead of him another jet car pulled out across the highway,\nblocking it. He was forced to stop.\n\n\"Hold on there!\" roared a man suddenly appearing at the side of the car,\nholding a paralo-ray gun pointed directly at Jeff.\n\nJeff looked at him in mock surprise. \"What's going on here?\" he asked.\n\n\"Who are you?\" demanded the man roughly.\n\n\"Jeff Marshall. And this is Jane Logan. What's all the fuss about?\"\n\n\"We're looking for the Space Cadets. They murdered old Professor Sykes!\"\nsnapped the man. His eyes narrowed and he looked at Jeff closely. \"You\nwere pretty chummy with them, weren't you?\" he asked.\n\n\"Sure, I knew them,\" replied Jeff calmly. \"But if they've done anything\nto the professor, I want them caught as badly as you do. I've been the\nprofessor's assistant for years. He's--he's like a father to me.\"\n\nSeveral of the other men had gathered around the car and were listening.\n\"That's right, Joe,\" said a man on the outside of the group. \"This\nfeller's okay. And that's Logan's daughter, all right. They ain't done\nnothing.\"\n\n\"When was the last time you saw the cadets?\" demanded the man called\nJoe.\n\n\"Why, a couple of days ago,\" Jeff replied.\n\nThere was a long pause while the man continued to look at Jeff\nominously. Finally he stepped back and lowered the paralo-ray gun. \"All\nright, go on. But if you see those murdering cadets, let us know. We're\nout to get them, and when we do, we're going to--\"\n\n\"But what right have you to do this on your own?\" cried Jane.\n\n\"We ain't,\" said Joe. \"Governor Vidac made us all special deputies this\nmorning.\"\n\n\"But we'd do it, anyway,\" cried someone from the rear of the crowd.\n\"Those Space Cadets are guilty and we're going to see that they get\nwhat's coming to them!\" There was a roar of agreement.\n\nJeff nodded, stepped on the accelerator, and eased the car slowly\nthrough the group of men. As soon as he was free, he stepped down hard\nand sent the jet car racing along the highway back toward Roald City.\n\n\"Jeff--Jeff,\" asked Jane despairingly, \"do you think they'll catch the\nboys?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" replied Jeff grimly. \"But if they are caught, the only\nway we can save them is to find the professor's journal and pray that\nthe uranium report is in it.\"\n\n\"But you said the information would be there,\" said Jane.\n\n\"When you need something as badly as we need that report,\" replied Jeff,\n\"you never find it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe three Space Cadets were watching their pursuers from a high ridge.\nThey had been driven back all day, and now they could go no farther.\nCaught while climbing down the other side of the hills from the Logan\nfarm, they had narrowly escaped detection at the very beginning and had\nbeen racing from cover to cover ever since. Now there was no place to\ngo. It was only a question of time before the colonists would reach the\ntop of the ridge and find them.\n\n\"What do you think they'll do?\" asked Roger.\n\n\"We'll be sent off this satellite so fast,\" answered Tom, \"you'll get\nsick from acceleration.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Astro.\n\n\"Vidac won't want us hanging around. Not since Captain Strong is here.\nHe'll give us a trial within an hour, sentence us to life on a prison\nrock, and delegate some of his boys to take us back. We don't have a\nchance.\"\n\nAstro let out a low animal-like growl. \"If that happens,\" said the giant\nVenusian, \"I'll get off that rock someway, somehow. And I'll find Mr.\nVidac. And when I do--\"\n\n\"No need to talk like that now,\" said Tom. \"Let's just not get caught!\"\n\n\"But how?\" asked Roger. \"Look, over there! They've already reached the\ntop of that ridge on the left. The party on the right will be up there\nsoon too. We're trapped!\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" said Astro. He picked up a huge boulder and hefted it\nin his arms. \"We can stand them off all day by tumbling rocks down on\nthem.\"\n\n\"And kill innocent people who don't know what they're doing?\" asked Tom.\n\"No--put it down, Astro!\"\n\n\"All right, brains!\" snapped Roger. \"What have you got to suggest?\"\n\n\"There's only one thing we can do!\" said Tom. \"Down on the side of the\nhill here I noticed a small cave. Two of us could squeeze inside.\"\n\n\"Why only two?\" asked Astro.\n\n\"Somebody would have to cover the entrance from the outside with a\nboulder and then give himself up!\"\n\nAstro slapped Tom on the back. \"That's a terrific idea. Come on. You two\nhide and I'll move the rock over.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute, you goof,\" said Roger. \"Don't be in such a hurry to be a\nblasted hero!\" He turned to Tom. \"Just like that Venusian hick to be\nready to sacrifice himself to get a Solar Medal!\"\n\n\"Don't argue, Junior,\" snapped Astro. \"I'm the only one strong enough to\nmove one of those rocks. You two hide and I'll cover you.\"\n\n\"Now wait a minute, Astro,\" Tom protested. \"I didn't mean....\"\n\n\"You should have,\" replied Astro. \"And if you don't get moving now,\nyou'll never make it!\"\n\nRoger looked at Tom and nodded. \"Guess he's right for once in his life,\nTom. He's the only one strong enough to do it.\"\n\nTom hesitated and then slapped Astro on the back. \"All right, Astro,\" he\nsaid. \"But there's more to it than just giving yourself up! You've got\nto make them think that Roger and I ran out on you. That way they'll\ncontinue to search for us, but in another direction. And Vidac won't try\nto do anything to you alone. He'll wait until he's got all of us.\"\n\n\"O.K.,\" said Astro. \"I get it. Come on. Get in that cave.\"\n\nThe three boys scrambled down the side of the hill and found the cave\nTom had seen. After a quick search Astro found a boulder that\nhalf-covered the front of the cave, and the three boys pushed it close\nto the entrance.\n\n\"Go on. Get inside now,\" said Astro. \"I'll push this one into position\nand then pile a few smaller ones on top and around it. That way you'll\nbe able to get air and still be hidden.\"\n\nTom and Roger crawled into the hole and settled themselves as Astro\npushed the boulder up against the opening. He piled the other stones\naround it quickly. When he had just about finished he heard someone\nbehind him. He turned and saw one of the colonists scrambling down the\nside of the hill, heading for him.\n\n\"Here they come,\" Astro whispered hoarsely. \"Spaceman's luck!\" He\ndropped the last stone in place and turned to face the man who was now\nalmost upon him.\n\nTom and Roger crouched in the darkness and listened intently.\n\n\"You there!\" they heard the colonist cry. \"Halt! Don't move or I'll\nfreeze you!\"\n\nAstro stood still. The man came up to him and felt the cadet's uniform\nfor a hidden weapon. Then he jammed the ray gun into Astro's back and\nordered him down the hill. Astro started walking, hardly daring to\nbreathe, but suddenly the man stopped.\n\n\"Where are the others?\" he demanded.\n\n\"They ran out on me.\"\n\n\"Ran out on you. I thought you three were supposed to be such good\nbuddies?\"\n\n\"When the chips were down,\" said Astro as harshly as he could, \"they\nturned out to be nothing but yellow rats!\"\n\n\"Which way did they go?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Astro. \"It happened last night. We went to sleep,\nand when I woke up, they were gone.\"\n\n\"Where'd they go?\" snarled the man, pushing the ray gun into Astro's\nback.\n\n\"I--I--\" Astro pretended he didn't want to talk.\n\n\"I'll freeze you, so help me,\" said the man. \"I'm going to count\nfive--one, two, three, four--\"\n\n\"Don't! I'll tell you!\" cried Astro. \"I'm not sure, but I think they\nheaded back for the city. We were talking about it last night. We\nfigured it would be the best place to hide.\"\n\n\"Ummm. That makes sense,\" said the man. \"I guess you're telling the\ntruth. Now get down the hill. One false move and I'll blast you!\"\n\nAstro turned and stumbled down the hill in front of the paralo-ray gun.\nA smile tugged at his lips.\n\nVidac and Bush were waiting for them on the highway at the bottom of the\nhill.\n\n\"Where are Corbett and Manning?\" Vidac demanded, looking at Astro.\n\nAstro repeated the story about Tom and Roger having deserted him.\n\nVidac eyed him speculatively. \"They just walked out on you?\" he asked.\n\nAstro nodded.\n\nVidac turned to the colonists who were standing around listening to the\ngiant Venusian's story. \"All right, men,\" he said, \"I guess he's telling\nthe truth. Back to the city. There aren't too many places they could be\nhiding.\"\n\nThe men turned and ran for their cars. Vidac continued to look at Astro,\na thin smile tugging at his lips, his eyes twinkling. \"You stay here\nwith me, Bush,\" said Vidac.\n\n\"But you said--\"\n\n\"Never mind what I said,\" snapped Vidac. \"I'm telling you to stay here.\nHave some of the colonists double up and leave a jet car here.\"\n\nIn a few moments the rest of the jet cars were roaring off toward the\ncity. Vidac waited until the last car had vanished down the road, then\nhe turned to Astro, \"Do you really think you fooled me with that stuff\nabout Manning and Corbett running out on you?\"\n\n\"What happened to them then?\" asked Astro innocently.\n\n\"We'll see,\" said Vidac softly, looking up into the hills.\n\nHolding a paralo-ray gun on the giant cadet, Vidac forced him into his\njet car. Bush slid under the wheel and started the jets.\n\n\"You think the cadets are still up there in the hills?\" asked Bush.\n\n\"Never mind what I think,\" snapped Vidac. \"Head for the spaceport.\"\n\nVidac spun around in his seat and looked back along the highway. He\npunched Astro in the shoulder and motioned for him to look. Astro turned\nto see the jet car left by Vidac pulling away from the hills.\n\n\"They must have heard every word I said,\" mused Vidac. He turned to\nBush. \"When they reach the spaceport, don't bother waiting for them to\nget out of the car. Blast them on sight!\"\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" asked Astro tightly.\n\n\"Don't you remember your Space Code laws, Astro?\" asked Vidac. \"Article\nSixteen? It specifically states that in cases of emergency, the\ncommanding officer of a Solar Guard community can be the judge and jury,\nand can pass sentence for felonies or worse. In two hours you and your\nbuddies will be aboard the _Polaris_, under guard, and headed for a life\nsentence on a prison rock!\" He laughed. \"And I'll make it stick!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 20\n\n\nJeff Marshall was just turning the jet car into the Plaza in front of\nthe Administration Building when Jane suddenly grabbed his arm.\n\n\"Jeff, look!\" she cried. \"Isn't that Captain Strong?\"\n\nThe enlisted spaceman slowed the car and followed the direction of\nJane's pointing finger. He saw Strong step around the corner of the\nAdministration Building, stop, then scurry back around to the side. The\nstreets of the city were deserted. \"He's running away from us,\" said\nJeff. \"Probably thinks we're part of that searching party coming back.\"\n\nHe brought the car to a screaming halt in front of the building and\njumped out, calling, \"Captain Strong!\" His voice echoed through the\ndeserted streets. \"This is Jeff Marshall!\"\n\nPeering around the corner of the Administration Building, Strong saw\nMarshall clearly and then recognized the daughter of Hyram Logan. He\ndashed out of his hiding place and greeted them with a yell.\n\n\"Jeff! Jeff! Over here!\"\n\nThe three friends of the Space Cadets were soon telling each other the\nlatest developments. Strong listened to Jeff's story of the professor's\nwork journal and shook his head disgustedly. \"I was in that lab for\nnearly four hours this morning,\" he said. \"If I had only known.\"\n\n\"Don't blame yourself, sir,\" said Jeff. \"You didn't know it was there!\"\n\n\"Let's find it now,\" said Jane desperately. \"We're losing time. Those\nmen back in the hills may catch the boys.\"\n\n\"They haven't been caught yet,\" asserted Strong. \"And if I know my\ncadets, those men will have a hard time nailing them. Come on!\" He\nturned and raced into the Administration Building, heading for Professor\nSykes's laboratory.\n\nIn less than five minutes Jeff was searching through the pages of the\nprofessor's work journal. \"There's no telling when he made the\ndiscovery,\" said Jeff, scanning the mass of complicated diagrams and\nfigures.\n\n\"It must have been soon after our arrival on Roald,\" said Jane. \"That\nwas when we saw him searching the hills around our farm.\"\n\nJeff flipped the pages back to the front of the book and began to read\nit from the beginning. \"Here's something!\" He quoted some figures from\nthe book and looked at Strong.\n\n\"That make any sense to you, sir?\" he asked.\n\n\"It sure does!\" said Strong. \"That's a preliminary survey on uranium!\nHe's just getting the scent there. Keep reading.\"\n\nJeff turned a few more pages and suddenly stopped. \"Here it is!\" he\nexclaimed. \"And say--look at this!\" He handed the journal over to Strong\nwho began to read quickly. \"'... conclusive proof found today in hills\nsurrounding farming area of Hyram Logan. Potentially the biggest hot\nmetal strike I've ever seen. Am going to make a report to Vidac today.\nThis could mean the beginning of a new era in space travel. Enough fuel\nto send fleets of ships on protracted voyages to any part of the\nuniverse....'\"\n\nStrong stopped reading and looked at Jane and Jeff.\n\n\"This was dated the tenth.\" He turned the page and continued, \"This is\nthe day after, the eleventh. Listen to this! '... Vidac is sending my\ninformation to the Solar Council immediately. He was very impressed.'\nAnd so forth and so forth.\"\n\nStrong closed the journal and faced Jeff and Jane again, a triumphant\nsmile on his lips. \"This is just what we needed. This journal is\nadmissible in Solar Courts as evidence the same way a ship's log is!\nCome on. Now we've got to get Vidac before he gets the cadets!\"\n\n\"Wait,\" said Jane in a fearful whisper. \"Listen.\"\n\nStrong and Jeff stood still. In the distance they heard the unmistakable\nroar of jet cars converging on the Plaza. Strong turned to Jeff.\n\"They've either found the cadets or--\"\n\n\"Or what?\" asked Jeff.\n\n\"I--I won't say it,\" said Strong hesitantly, \"but if anything has\nhappened to those boys, I'll personally dig Vidac's grave!\"\n\nJane had moved to the window and was watching the wild activity in the\nPlaza below. \"They're spreading out!\" she cried. \"They must be searching\nthe city.\"\n\nStrong rushed to the window and looked down. \"That means they haven't\nfound the cadets!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"I've been thinking, sir,\" said Jeff. \"Do you think we really have\nenough proof of Vidac's guilt to make the colonists understand it was\nVidac and not the cadets who could have done something to the\nprofessor?\"\n\n\"We've got to try!\" said Strong. \"We've got to try!\"\n\nThe two spacemen and Jane left the laboratory and raced down the\nslidestairs and through the halls of the Administration Building to the\ndouble doors that opened onto the Plaza. They stepped into view just as\nthe colonists were about to spread out and search the city. One of the\nmen was standing on the steps shouting orders. Jeff recognized him as\nJoe, the man who had stopped him on the highway. There was a roar from\nthe crowd when they noticed Strong, Jeff, and Jane standing in the open\ndoorway.\n\nStrong held the black journal high over his head and called for order.\nThe colonists crowded around at the base of the steps not knowing what\nto make of his sudden appearance.\n\n\"What are you doing here?\" demanded the colonist deputy. \"You're Captain\nStrong of the Solar Guard, aren't you?\"\n\n\"That's right,\" replied Strong. \"And you're making a big mistake\naccusing the cadets of the murder of Professor Sykes, when you're not\neven sure the professor has been murdered! The man you want to question\nabout that is Lieutenant Governor Vidac!\"\n\nA startled murmur ran through the assembled men. Strong continued, \"I\nhave absolute proof that Vidac received information about the biggest\nuranium strike in the history of the universe from Professor Sykes and\nplans to keep it for himself. His accusation of the cadets is a cover-up\nto clear himself and to throw you off the track.\"\n\nThe word _uranium_ spread through the crowd like wildfire.\n\n\"You're pretty friendly with the cadets,\" sneered the deputy. \"How do we\nknow you're telling us the truth, and not just trying to save them?\"\n\n\"Yeah. Answer that one!\" roared a voice from back of the crowd.\n\n\"Do any of you understand physics?\" asked Strong.\n\n\"Physics?\" asked the deputy. \"What's that got to do with it?\"\n\n\"Plenty! I have information here in this journal that will prove what I\njust said! Read it for yourself. It's in the professor's own\nhandwriting.\"\n\n\"I can read it,\" said a small man in front of Strong. \"Gimme that\nthing!\" Strong handed him the black book and told the man where to look.\nThe man considered it for five minutes, then turned to the crowd. \"He's\nright! We're sitting on the hottest uranium rock in this galaxy!\"\n\n\"Where is it?\" cried someone from the crowd. \"Tell us where the uranium\nis!\"\n\nThe mob of men, forgetting all about the cadets, were now seized with\nthe greed for riches. Strong took the journal back and tucked it under\nhis arm.\n\n\"I'll tell you where it is,\" said Strong, \"when we put Vidac where he\nbelongs! Behind bars!\"\n\n\"What are we waiting for?\" cried the colonists. \"Let's get that\nmurdering space crawler!\"\n\nThe deputy pushed his way through the crowd and raced for his car.\nOthers followed and once more the Plaza echoed to the roar of jets.\n\nStrong turned to Jeff. \"You'll find Winters up in Vidac's quarters. I\nhad to freeze him.\" He handed over the paralo-ray gun. \"Get him and\nfollow us to the spaceport. Tell him we know everything, and if he\ndoesn't talk, he'll get life on a prison rock.\"\n\n\"Right,\" said Jeff. \"I'll get a confession out of him if I have to wring\nhis neck--and I'll get it on a soundscriber!\"\n\n\"Good. Come on, Jane,\" said Strong. \"This is the finish of a would-be\ntyrant!\"\n\nJeff turned and dashed back into the building, while Strong and Jane\nclimbed into the jet car and roared off toward the spaceport.\n\n\"If we only had a paralo-ray gun,\" muttered Roger as he and Tom sped\nafter Vidac's powerful jet car.\n\n\"Yes,\" agreed Tom. \"This could be a trap, but what can we do?\"\n\nRoger was silent. They had moved out of the cave as soon as Astro had\nbeen taken down the hill and they knew exactly what Vidac had in mind.\nBut their need for information about Professor Sykes and their concern\nfor Astro forced them to follow the powerful jet car into what they were\ncertain was a trap.\n\n\"We'll ditch the jet car after we find out where they're going,\" said\nTom, \"and figure out something afterward.\"\n\n\"You think they'll go to Sykes?\" asked Roger.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"It's a pretty safe bet, Roger. The professor's been well hidden, so why\nnot hide Astro in the same place, hoping in the meantime to get us\nalso.\"\n\n\"But I can't see walking into a trap, simply because we know it's\nthere!\"\n\n\"Roger--look! Vidac's stopping the car! Astro's trying to get away!\"\n\n\"Astro's fighting with Bush!\" shouted Roger. \"Come on! Can't you get any\nmore push out of this wagon?\"\n\nTom jammed the accelerator down to the floorboard and the jet car fairly\nleaped ahead. Fifty yards from Vidac's stalled car, Tom slammed on the\nbrake, bringing the little car to a screaming halt only two feet away.\nRoger was halfway out before the car had stopped moving. Beside Vidac's\ncar, Bush was wrestling with Astro.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Tom! Roger! Get back! It's a trap!\" yelled Astro.\n\nAstro's warning came too late. While Tom and Roger sprang to help their\nunit mate, Vidac slipped up on the other side and fired quickly and\naccurately with a paralo-ray gun. Tom and Roger were frozen just as they\nwere about to pull Bush from Astro's back.\n\nVidac swung the ray gun around toward Astro. \"See that, big boy?\" He\nlaughed. \"Well, you're going to get the same thing if you make one funny\nmove. Now pile those two stiffs into the back of my car! Get moving!\"\n\nSeething with frustration and rage, Astro turned to Roger and Tom,\nstanding like solid slabs of stone. He picked up Roger and carried him\ngently to the car, placing him in the back. Then he turned and walked\ntoward Tom. He made a slight movement toward Vidac and Bush, but they\nleveled their guns quickly.\n\n\"None of that,\" warned Vidac. Astro's shoulders drooped. He was almost\nin tears as he walked toward Tom. The curly-haired cadet stood\nimmovable, staring at his friend. The Venusian leaned over and picked up\nTom gently.\n\n\"Take it easy, Astro,\" whispered Tom, not moving his lips. \"I'm not\nfrozen. He missed me!\"\n\nAstro nearly jumped at the sound of Tom's voice. He recovered quickly,\nfighting back a grin of triumph. He threw a quick glance at Vidac and\nBush, then carefully picked Tom up and carried him to the car. As he was\nabout to turn around again, he felt the sudden jolt of the paralo ray,\nand in the split-second before the ray took effect, Astro nearly\nlaughed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUnder the effects of a paralo-ray charge the body is paralyzed and there\nis no feeling. Tom, however, lying beside Roger but beneath Astro in\nthe back seat of the car, began to suffer painful muscular cramps. He\ngritted his teeth, trying to lie rigidly still, but his arms and legs\nbegan to jerk spasmodically and he had to move.\n\nSlowly he eased one arm from beneath Astro's heavy body and shifted his\nlegs into a more comfortable position. Though the Venusian's weight\nstill pressed him down in the seat, the muscular cramps were relieved.\nHe began to pay attention to what Vidac and Bush were saying in the\nfront seat of the car.\n\n\"We'll blast off as soon as we reach the spaceport,\" said Vidac, \"and get\nup to the asteroid.\"\n\n\"Why so fast?\" asked Bush.\n\n\"I want to get rid of those nosy space rats as quickly as possible. Then\nI'll go after Strong.\"\n\nBush shook his head. \"That won't be easy. Strong's not a Space Cadet.\nHe's Solar Guard. And good Solar Guard at that!\"\n\nTom smiled in wholehearted agreement with the lieutenant governor's\nhenchman.\n\nVidac sneered. \"Don't make me laugh! Didn't you see the way I convinced\nthose dumb colonists that the cadets were responsible for the\nprofessor's murder? If they'd stopped to think about it, they would have\nrealized I was putting one over on them. All you have to do is keep\ntalking, fast and loud. Keep them off balance, and don't let them\nthink.\"\n\n\"There's the spaceport road,\" said Bush. \"And there's the _Polaris_. I\nhope we don't have any trouble with the grease monkeys when they see us\nhauling the cadets out.\"\n\n\"If they start anything,\" said Vidac with a sneer, \"you know what to\ndo.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said Bush, patting his paralo-ray gun.\n\nThe car roared through the gates of the spaceport and sped across the\nhard surface of the field. A moment later it came to a shuddering stop\nat the base of the giant rocket cruiser.\n\n\"All right,\" said Vidac. \"Get them aboard the ship. Hardy will blow a\ngasket if we don't get this over with in a hurry.\"\n\nHardy! The name hit Tom like a trip hammer. So Hardy was mixed up in it!\nHardy, the respected Governor of Roald, the man responsible for the\nwelfare of the colony and the lives of the colonists, was really a\nswindler and a thief. Now if Jeff only had Professor Sykes's journal\nthey could tie everything together, providing he could stop Vidac from\nsending them off to a prison rock! Tom's thoughts were suddenly\ninterrupted by the movement of Astro's heavy body on top of him. The\nyoung cadet broke out into a cold sweat. When he had been supposedly hit\nby the paralo ray his arms had been outstretched! He had been so busy\nthinking about Hardy's connection with Vidac that he had forgotten to\nresume his original position.\n\nAstro was hauled out of the car and Bush reached in the car to get Tom.\nThe boy braced himself and waited as the spaceman grabbed him by the\nfeet. He was pulled roughly out of the door and stood on his feet. Out\nof the corner of his eye he could see that Astro had been stood up\nbeside the car like a tree. Vidac turned away from the giant cadet and\nstarted to give Bush a hand. Suddenly he stopped and pulled out his\nparalo-ray gun.\n\n\"Boss, what're you doing?\" cried Bush, jumping away from Tom and leaving\nthe cadet rocking on his feet, trying to pretend he was still paralyzed.\nHe toppled forward, and before he realized what he had done, threw out\nhis hands to break his fall.\n\nVidac laughed. \"I have to hand it to you, Corbett. That was the best bit\nof acting I've ever seen in my life.\"\n\nTom picked himself up from the ground and glared at Vidac. Bush stood to\none side, too startled to realize what had happened.\n\n\"You mean, he--he--\" Bush stammered, his eyes wide with alarm.\n\n\"That's right,\" said Vidac. \"The wonder boy of the space lanes acted as\nif he was frozen. What were you going to do, Corbett? Take over, maybe?\"\n\n\"You'll never get away with it, Vidac,\" said Tom through clenched teeth.\n\"You're through and you know it!\"\n\n\"Not yet, my friend,\" said Vidac. \"You've had your fun. Now get your\nfriend out of the car and carry him aboard the _Polaris_. We're all\ngoing for a little ride!\"\n\nTom turned reluctantly and began pulling Roger out of the back of the\ncar. He realized that he could take no more chances with the paralo ray.\nAs long as he was awake, there was a chance for him to do something. He\nlifted Roger gently to his shoulder, turned, and staggered toward the\ncruiser. Just as he was about to step inside the hatch, he heard the\nfaint roar of jets in the distance. He stumbled and fell purposely to\nstall for time. He and Roger sprawled full length on the deck. As Tom\nsat up and rubbed his knee, Bush rushed over, leaving Vidac to struggle\nwith the immense bulk of Astro.\n\n\"Get up!\" snarled Bush. He poked the gun within an inch of Tom's face.\nThe cadet knew that if Bush fired at such a close range, his brains\nwould be burned to a crisp. He fell away from the gun.\n\n\"I wrenched my knee,\" he whined. \"I can't get up!\"\n\n\"If you don't get up by the time I count three,\" growled Bush, \"I'll\nblast you! One, two--\"\n\nThe roar of the jets was closer now and Tom's heart began to race.\nFeigning pain in his leg, he started to pull himself to his feet. He\nglanced toward the spaceport entrance and saw a stream of jet cars\npouring into the field, heading for the _Polaris_. Suddenly Tom leaped\nfor Bush from the crouching position. He lashed out with his right fist,\nwhile grabbing for the ray gun with his left.\n\nBush was not to be tricked so easily. He fired just as the cadet jumped.\nBut in trying to evade Tom's crashing right hand, he missed his shot and\nwas grazed by Tom's fist. He fell back out of the spaceship, his gun\nfalling inside the air-lock portal.\n\nTom lay on the deck, wincing in pain. The wild shot had caught him in\nthe right leg and he was unable to move it. He crawled across the deck,\nreaching for the gun as Bush came charging up the ramp.\n\nMeanwhile, Vidac, seeing the commotion in the hatch of the spaceship,\npulled his gun and leveled it at Tom. But Bush charged through the hatch\njust as Vidac fired and he caught the full blast of Vidac's shot. He\nlanded on the deck beside Tom, stiff as a board.\n\nTom reached for the gun, preparing to fight it out with Vidac. But the\nodds were against him. His leg was completely paralyzed and Vidac was\nclimbing into the ship. He knew he couldn't reach the gun in time.\n\nSuddenly Vidac became aware of the jet cars streaming into the\nspaceport. He stopped and turned to look at them. Then, sensing\nsomething was wrong, he turned back to dash into the _Polaris_. The\nsecond his back was turned was sufficient time for Tom to grab the gun\nand fire. Vidac was stopped cold, his bright eyes burning with hate,\nunable to move.\n\n\"You can drop that now,\" said a voice in back of Tom.\n\nThe curly-haired cadet whirled around to face Governor Hardy, holding a\nparalo-ray rifle up to his shoulder, aimed and ready to fire.\n\n\"You're a good spaceman, Corbett,\" said Hardy in a cold, harsh voice,\n\"but this is the last time you'll ever get into my hair!\"\n\nTom's leg prevented him from moving and he had turned in an awkward\nsitting position to face Hardy. All he could do was bring his gun up\nquickly and fire over his left shoulder. Hardy fired at the same\ninstant. At such close range neither could miss.\n\nWhen Captain Strong and the colonists dashed into the ship they found\ntwo perfect statues.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 21\n\n\n\"And you kept giving Hardy wrong information?\" asked Strong with a\nlaugh.\n\n\"Yes!\" snorted Professor Sykes with a wry grin. \"You see, I knew right\naway Vidac was doing something funny way back--\" He paused to sip his\ntea. \"Way back before we landed on Roald.\" He grinned broadly at the\npeople seated around the table in the dining room of the Logan house,\nRoger, Astro, Jeff, Tom, Jane, Billy, Hyram, and Strong.\n\nAfter Strong had released the Space Cadets from the effects of the\nparalo rays, they had searched the _Polaris_ and found the professor\nlocked in one of the cabins. Placing Vidac and Hardy under arrest and\nconfining them in the brig of the ship with Winters and Bush, they had\nreturned to the Logan farm to clear a few of the mysteries surrounding\nthe nightmare of violence since their landing on Roald.\n\n\"When Vidac and Hardy refused to let me go down and make an inspection\nof the satellite after the instruments conked out, I knew there was\nsomething fishy,\" Sykes continued. \"Any fool could have seen that\nradioactivity would be the only thing to cause an instrument\ndisturbance like that!\"\n\n\"Then Vidac and Hardy knew about the uranium?\" asked Strong. \"We only\ndiscovered it at Space Academy ourselves a little while ago.\"\n\n\"They knew about it all right,\" asserted Sykes. \"Hardy told me so\nhimself. He got the information from an old prospector who had made\napplication to come to Roald as a colonist. The space rat had been here\nbefore, as a sailor on a deep spacer that had wandered off course. The\nship was running low on water so the skipper sent him down to the\nsatellite to see if he could find any. He found the water and the\nuranium too. But he clammed up about that, hoping to keep it a secret\nuntil he could go back and claim it. His only chance was to become a\ncolonist, and when he washed out in the screening, he told Hardy, hoping\nto bribe his way. Of course Hardy double-crossed him to get the uranium\nhimself. That was why you were pulled off the project and sent to Pluto,\nStrong. Then he got Vidac to be his aide and everything looked rosy.\"\n\n\"It's still hard to believe that Hardy was behind the whole operation,\"\nsaid Astro, shaking his head. \"Imagine--the governor of the colony\nratting on his own people.\"\n\n\"It's happened before, unfortunately,\" commented Strong. \"Better men\nthan Hardy have succumbed to the lure of riches and power.\"\n\n\"You're right, Strong,\" snapped Sykes. \"That's just what happened to\nHardy. While I was his prisoner on the _Polaris_, he kept boasting about\nhow rich he was going to be--how powerful. When I reminded him of his\npast achievements and of his responsibility to the colony, he just\nlaughed. He said getting the uranium meant more to him than anything in\nthe world.\" The little professor sighed. \"If it hadn't been for the\ncadets, he would have gotten away with it.\"\n\n\"But wait a minute,\" said Roger. \"If you suspected Vidac, why did you\ngive him the information on the uranium to send back to the Solar\nGuard?\"\n\n\"I just told him about a puny little deposit near the Logan farm,\"\nreplied Sykes. \"The big strike is on the other side of the satellite. I\nfigured that if Vidac was honest it wouldn't hurt to delay sending\ninformation back about the big strike until later.\" He paused and added,\n\"But then, of course, I had to tell him about the big strike.\"\n\n\"You had to tell him!\" exclaimed Jeff. \"But why?\"\n\n\"To stay alive, you idiot!\" barked Sykes. \"As long as I had something\nthey wanted, they'd keep me alive until they found out about it. They\ngave me truth serum, but I'm immune to drugs. All Solar Guard scientists\nare. They didn't know that. So I told them to look here, then there,\nacted as though I had lost my memory. It worked, and here I am.\"\n\n\"What about the way they antagonized us?\" asked Tom. \"Refusing to let us\ncontact Space Academy and sending us out on a stripped-down rocket scout\nto investigate the asteroid cluster. It seems to me they should have\nacted a little more friendly to throw us off the track. All they did was\narouse suspicion and get us sore.\"\n\n\"But they hoped that you would get angry enough to do something\nrebellious, so that they could send you back,\" said Sykes.\n\n\"Well, that makes sense,\" said Strong. \"But what about their treatment\nof the colonists?\"\n\n\"Humph. A clear case of attempting to get the colonists to rebel which\nwould give them the right to absolute control of the entire satellite\nand the people. Cadet Tom Corbett here is to be congratulated for not\nallowing Mr. Logan to go around like a vigilante and get us all in a\nspace hurricane!\"\n\nHyram Logan blushed and cleared his throat noisily.\n\nThe door suddenly opened and a uniformed messenger thrust a dispatch\ninto Strong's hands.\n\n\"What's this?\" asked Strong, tearing the Solar Guard seal.\n\n\"Message from spaceport control, sir,\" said the messenger. \"They report\na fleet of ships approaching Roald, under full thrust.\"\n\n\"A fleet!\" gasped Strong. \"But how? Why?\"\n\nSykes laughed, winked at Jane, and slapped his thigh. \"The Solar Guard\ncoming to the rescue!\"\n\n\"Solar Guard!\" chorused the others at the table.\n\n\"Yes! Solar Guard. I sent for them. I figured if the cadets could build\na communicator, I could too. I did it on the _Polaris_ when Hardy went\nsearching for the uranium. I told the whole story to Commander Walters\nback at Space Academy.\"\n\n\"Well,\" sighed Roger, \"with the confession Jeff got from Winters on the\naudioscriber, I guess we can consider the first civil disorder of the\nstar satellite of Roald finished. Peace and harmony will reign. And\nspeaking of harmony, Jane, would you like to take a walk in the\nstarlight?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Roger,\" answered Jane, blushing prettily, \"but I've already\nbeen invited.\"\n\nRoger's face fell. \"You've already been invited?\"\n\nJane nodded. \"Ready, Astro?\"\n\n\"Sure!\" replied the giant Venusian. He rose, offered Jane his arm\nceremoniously, and the two walked out of the house. Roger's face turned\na deep scarlet. The others around the table burst into laughter.\n\n\"Ah, go blow your jets,\" growled Roger.\n\nBilly's eyes were shining. He turned to Strong. \"Captain Strong, how old\ndo you have to be to get into Space Academy?\"\n\nStrong's eyes twinkled. \"Since Roger doesn't seem to be too busy, why\ndon't you ask him for all the Academy dope?\"\n\n\"Would you help me, Roger?\" pleaded Billy. \"I can recite the whole book\nof Academy 'regs' by heart!\"\n\nRoger glanced around the table with a sheepish grin. \"There isn't but\none regulation that's really important, Billy.\"\n\n\"Oh? What's that?\"\n\n\"I'll answer that, Billy,\" said Tom. \"Roger means the one that goes like\nthis ... 'no cadet will be allowed to entertain any work, project, or\nideas that will not lend themselves directly to his immediate or future\nobligation as a spaceman.'\" Tom stopped and smiled broadly. \"And that\nmeans girls!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCalling all boys and girls to Mercury, Venus, Jupiter and all\npoints in outer space--\n\nYou, too, can be a part of the group of daring adventurers from the\nSpace Academy who travel to mysterious lands in outer space on dangerous\nand exciting missions.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
