The fear led to a hate that threatened the lives of\n  millions and endangered the Galactic peace._\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nThe little Med Ship came out of overdrive and the stars were strange and\nthe Milky Way seemed unfamiliar. Which, of course, was because the Milky\nWay and the local Cepheid marker-stars were seen from an unaccustomed\nangle and a not-yet-commonplace pattern of varying magnitudes. But\nCalhoun grunted in satisfaction. There was a banded sun off to port,\nwhich was good. A breakout at no more than sixty light-hours from\none's destination wasn't bad, in a strange sector of the Galaxy and\nafter three light-years of journeying blind.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Arise and shine, Murgatroyd,\" said Calhoun. \"Comb your whiskers. Get\nset to astonish the natives!\"\n\nA sleepy, small, shrill voice said;\n\n\"_Chee!_\"\n\nMurgatroyd the _tormal_ came crawling out of his small cubbyhole. He\nblinked at Calhoun.\n\n\"We're due to land shortly,\" Calhoun observed. \"You'll impress the local\ninhabitants. I'll be unpopular. According to the records, there's been\nno Med Ship inspection here for twelve standard years. And that was\npractically no inspection, to judge by the report.\"\n\nMurgatroyd said;\n\n\"_Chee-chee!_\"\n\nHe began to make his toilet, first licking his right-hand whiskers and\nthen his left. Then he stood up and shook himself and looked\ninterestedly at Calhoun. _Tormals_ are companionable small animals. They\nare charmed when somebody speaks to them. They find great, deep\nsatisfaction in imitating the actions of humans, as parrots and mynahs\nand parrokets imitate human speech. But _tormals_ have certain useful,\ngenetically transmitted talents which make them much more valuable than\nmere companions or pets.\n\nCalhoun got a light-reading for the banded sun. It could hardly be an\naccurate measure of distance, but it was a guide. He said;\n\n\"Hold on to something, Murgatroyd!\"\n\nCalhoun threw the overdrive switch and the Med Ship flicked back into\nthat questionable state of being in which velocities of some hundreds of\ntimes that of light are possible. The sensation of going into overdrive\nwas unpleasant. A moment later, the sensation of coming out was no less\nso. Calhoun had experienced it often enough, and still didn't like it.\n\nThe sun Weald burned huge and terrible in space. It was close, now. Its\ndisk covered half a degree of arc.\n\n\"Very neat,\" observed Calhoun. \"Weald Three is our port, Murgatroyd. The\nplane of the ecliptic would be--Hm....\"\n\nHe swung the outside electron telescope, picked up a nearby bright\nobject, enlarged its image to show details, and checked it against the\nlocal star-pilot. He calculated a moment. The distance was too short for\neven the briefest of overdrive hops, but it would take time to get there\non solar-system drive.\n\nHe thumbed down the communicator-button and spoke into a microphone.\n\n\"Med Ship Aesclipus Twenty reporting arrival and asking co\u00f6rdinates for\nlanding. Purpose of landing, planetary health inspection. Our mass is\nfifty tons standard. We should arrive at a landing position in something\nunder four hours. Repeat. Med Ship Aesclipus Twenty ...\"\n\nHe finished the regular second transmission and made coffee for himself\nwhile he waited for an answer. Murgatroyd wanted a cup of coffee too.\nMurgatroyd adored coffee. He held a tiny cup in a furry small paw and\nsipped gingerly at the hot liquid.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA voice came out of the communicator;\n\n\"_Aesclipus Twenty, repeat your identification!_\"\n\nCalhoun went to the control-board.\n\n\"Aesclipus Twenty,\" he said patiently, \"is a Med Ship, sent by the\nInterstellar Medical Service to make a planetary health inspection on\nWeald. Check with your public health authorities. This is the first Med\nShip visit in twelve standard years, I believe, which is inexcusable.\nBut your health authorities will know all about it. Check with them.\"\n\nThe voice said truculently;\n\n\"_What was your last port?_\"\n\nCalhoun named it. This was not his home sector, but Sector Twelve had\ngotten into a very bad situation. Some of its planets had gone unvisited\nfor as long as twenty years, and twelve between inspections was almost\ncommon-place. Other sectors had been called on to help it catch up.\nCalhoun was one of the loaned Med Ship men, and because of the emergency\nhe'd been given a list of half a dozen planets to be inspected one after\nanother, instead of reporting back to sector headquarters after each\nvisit. He'd had minor troubles before with landing-grid operators in\nSector Twelve.\n\nSo he was very patient. He named the planet last inspected, the one from\nwhich he'd set out for Weald Three. The voice from the communicator said\nsharply;\n\n\"_What port before that?_\"\n\nCalhoun named the one before the last.\n\n\"_Don't drive any closer,_\" said the voice harshly, \"_or you'll be\ndestroyed!_\"\n\nCalhoun said coldly;\n\n\"Now you listen to me, friend! I'm from the Interstellar Medical\nService! You get in touch with planetary health services immediately!\nRemind them of the Interstellar Medical Inspection Agreement, signed on\nTralee two hundred and forty standard years ago. Remind them that if\nthey do not cooperate in medical inspection that I can put your planet\nunder quarantine and your space commerce will be cut off like that! No\nship will be cleared for Weald from any other planet in the galaxy until\nthere has been a health inspection! Things have pretty well gone to pot\nso far as the Med Service in this sector is concerned, but we're trying\nto straighten it out. You have twenty minutes to clear this and then,\nI'm coming in. If I'm not landed, a quarantine goes on! Tell your health\nauthorities that!\"\n\nSilence. Calhoun clicked off and poured himself another cup of coffee.\nMurgatroyd held out his cup for a refill. Calhoun gave it to him.\n\n\"I hate to put on an official hat, Murgatroyd,\" he said annoyedly, \"but\nthere are some people who won't have any other way.\"\n\nMurgatroyd said \"_Chee!_\" and sipped at his cup.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCalhoun checked the course of the Med Ship. It bored on through space.\nThere were tiny noises from the communicator. There were whisperings and\nrustlings and the occasional strange and sometimes beautiful musical\nnotes whose origin is yet obscure, but which, since they are carried by\nelectromagnetic radiation of wildly varying wave-lengths, are not likely\nto be the fabled music of the spheres. He waited.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn fifteen minutes a different voice came from the speaker.\n\n\"_Med Ship Aesclipus! Med Ship Aesclipus!_\"\n\nCalhoun answered and the voice said anxiously;\n\n\"_'Sorry about the challenge, but we have the blueskin problem always\nwith us. We have to be extremely careful! Will you come in, please?_\"\n\n\"I'm on my way,\" said Calhoun.\n\n\"_The planetary health authorities,_\" said the voice, more anxiously\nstill, \"_are very anxious to be co\u00f6perative. We need Med Service help!\nWe lose a lot of sleep over the blueskins! Could you tell us the name of\nthe last Med Ship to land here, and its inspector, and when that\ninspection was made? We want to look up the record of the event to be\nable to assist you in every possible way._\"\n\n\"He's lying,\" Calhoun told Murgatroyd, \"but he's more scared than\nhostile.\"\n\nHe picked up the order-folio on Weald Three. He gave the information\nabout the last Med Ship visit. He clicked off.\n\n\"What?\" he asked, \"is a blueskin?\"\n\nHe'd read the folio on Weald, of course, but as the ship swam onward\nthrough emptiness he went through it again. The last medical inspection\nhad been only perfunctory. Twelve years earlier--instead of three--a\nMed Ship had landed on Weald. There had been official conferences with\nhealth officials. There was a report on the birth-rate, the death-rate,\nthe anomaly-rate, and a breakdown of all reported communicable diseases.\nBut that was all. There were no special comments and no overall picture.\n\nPresently Calhoun found the word in a Sector dictionary, where words of\nonly local usage were to be found.\n\n\"Blueskin; Colloquial term for a person recovered from a plague which\nleft large patches of blue pigment irregularly distributed over the\nbody. Especially, inhabitants of Dara. The condition is said to be\ncaused by a chronic, non-fatal form of Dara plague and has been said to\nbe non-infectious, though this is not certain. The etiology of Dara\nplague has not fully been worked out. The blueskin condition is\nhereditary but not a genetic modification, as markings appear in\nnon-Mendellian distributions....\"\n\nCalhoun puzzled over it. Nobody could have read the entire Sector\ndirectory, even with unlimited leisure during travel between solar\nsystems. Calhoun hadn't tried. But now he went laboriously through\nindices and cross-references while the ship continued travel onward. He\nfound no other reference to blueskins. He looked up Dara. It was listed\nas an inhabited planet, some four hundred years colonized, with a\nlanding-grid and at the time the main notice was written out, a\nflourishing interstellar commerce. But there was a memo, evidently added\nto the entry in some change of editions.\n\n\"Since plague, special license from Med Service is required for\nlanding.\"\n\nThat was all. Absolutely all.\n\nThe communicator said suavely;\n\n\"_Med Ship Aesclipus Twenty! Come in on vision, please!_\"\n\nCalhoun went to the control-board and threw on vision.\n\n\"Well, what now?\" he demanded.\n\nHis screen lighted. A bland face looked out at him.\n\n\"_We have--ah--verified your statements,_\" said the third voice from\nWeald. \"_Just one more item. Are you alone in your ship?_\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Calhoun, frowning.\n\n\"_Quite alone?_\" insisted the voice.\n\n\"Obviously!\" said Calhoun.\n\n\"_No other living creature?_\" insisted the voice again.\n\n\"Of--Oh!\" said Calhoun annoyedly. He called over his shoulder.\n\"Murgatroyd! Come here!\"\n\nMurgatroyd hopped to his lap and gazed interestedly at the screen. The\nbland face changed remarkably. The voice changed even more.\n\n\"_Very good!_\" it said. \"_Very, very good! Blueskins do not have_\ntormals! _You are Med Service! By all means come in. Your co\u00f6rdinates\nwill be ..._\"\n\nCalhoun wrote them down. He clicked off the communicator again and\ngrowled to Murgatroyd;\n\n\"So I might have been a blueskin, eh? And you're my passport, because\nonly Med Ships have members of your tribe aboard! What the hell's the\nmatter, Murgatroyd? They act like they think somebody's trying to get\ndown on their planet with a load of plague-germs!\"\n\nHe grumbled to himself for minutes. The life of a Med Ship man is not\nexactly a sinecure, at best. It means long periods in empty space in\noverdrive, which is absolute and deadly tedium. Then two or three days\naground, checking official documents and statistics, and asking\nquestions to see how many of the newest medical techniques have reached\nthis planet or that, and the supplying of information about such as have\nnot arrived. Then lifting out to space for long periods of tedium, to\nrepeat the process somewhere else. Med Ships carry only one man because\ntwo could not stand the close contact without quarreling with each\nother. But Med Ships do carry _tormals_, like Murgatroyd, and a _tormal_\nand a man can get along indefinitely, like a man and a dog. It is a\nhighly unequal friendship, but it seems to be satisfactory to both.\n\nCalhoun was very much annoyed with the way the Med Service had been\noperated in Sector Twelve. He was one of many men at work to correct the\nresults of incompetence in directing Med Service in the twelfth sector.\nBut it is always disheartening to have to labor at making up for\nsomebody else's blundering, when there is so much new work that needs to\nbe done.\n\nThe condition shown by the landing-grid suspicions was a case in point.\nBlueskins were people who inherited a splotchy skin-pigmentation from\nother people who'd survived a plague. Weald plainly maintained a\none-planet quarantine against them. But a quarantine is normally an\nemergency measure. The Med Service should have taken over, wiped out the\nneed for a quarantine, and then lifted it. It hadn't been done.\n\nCalhoun fumed to himself.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe world of Weald Three grew brighter and brighter and became a disk.\nThe disk had ice-caps and a reasonable proportion of land and water\nsurface. The Med Ship decelerated, and voices notified observation from\nthe surface, and the little craft came to a stop some five planetary\ndiameters out from solidity. The landing-field force-field locked on to\nit, and its descent began.\n\nThe business of landing was all very familiar, from the blue rim which\nappeared at the limb of the planet from one diameter out, to the\nsingular flowing-apart of the surface features as the ship sank still\nlower. There was the circular landing-grid, rearing skyward for nearly a\nmile. It could let down interstellar liners from emptiness and lift them\nout to emptiness again, with great convenience and economy for everyone.\n\nIt landed the Med Ship in its center, and there were officials to greet\nCalhoun, and he knew in advance the routine part of his visit. There\nwould be an interview with the planet's chief executive, by whatever\ntitle he was called. There would be a banquet. Murgatroyd would be\npetted by everybody. There would be painful efforts to impress Calhoun\nwith the splendid conduct of public health matters on Weald. He would be\ntold much scandal. He might find one man, somewhere, who passionately\nlabored to advance the welfare of his fellow humans by finding out how\nto keep them well, or failing that how to make them well when they got\nsick. And in two days, or three, Calhoun would be escorted back to the\nlanding-grid, and lifted out to space, and he'd spend long empty days in\noverdrive and land somewhere else to do the whole thing all over again.\n\nIt all happened exactly as he expected, with one exception. Every human\nbeing he met on Weald wanted to talk about blueskins. Blueskins and the\nidea of blueskins obsessed everyone. Calhoun listened without asking\nquestions until he had the picture of what blueskins meant to the people\nwho talked of them. Then he knew there would be no use asking questions\nat random. Nobody mentioned ever having seen a blueskin. Nobody\nmentioned a specific event in which a blueskin had at any named time\ntaken part. But everybody was afraid of blueskins. It was a patterned,\nan inculcated, a stage-directed fixed idea. And it found expression in\nshocked references to the vileness, the depravity, the monstrousness of\nthe blueskin inhabitants of Dara, from whom Weald must at all costs be\nprotected.\n\nIt did not make sense. So Calhoun listened politely until he found an\nundistinguished medical man who wanted some special information about\ngene-selection as practised halfway across the galaxy. He invited that\nman to the Med Ship, where he supplied the information not hitherto\navailable. He saw his guest's eyes shine a little with that joyous awe a\nman feels when he finds out something he has wanted long and badly to\nknow.\n\n\"Now,\" said Calhoun, \"tell me something! Why does everybody on this\nplanet hate the inhabitants of Dara? It's light-years away. Nobody\nclaims to have suffered in person from them. Why make a point of hating\nthem?\"\n\nThe Wealdian doctor grimaced.\n\n\"They've blue patches on their skins. They're different from us. So they\ncan be pictured as a danger and our political parties can make an\nelection issue out of competing for the privilege of defending us from\nthem. They had a plague on Dara, once. They're accused of still having\nit ready for export.\"\n\n\"Hm,\" said Calhoun. \"The story is that they want to spread contagion\nhere, eh? Doesn't anybody\"--his tone was sardonic--\"doesn't anybody urge\nthat they be massacred as an act of piety?\"\n\n\"Yes--s--s--s,\" admitted the doctor reluctantly. \"It's mentioned in\npolitical speeches.\"\n\n\"But how's it rationalized?\" demanded Calhoun. \"What's the argument to\nmake pigment-patches involve moral and physical degradation, as I'm\nassured is the case?\"\n\n\"In the public schools,\" said the doctor, \"the children are taught that\nblueskins are now carriers of the disease they survived three\ngenerations ago! That they hate everybody who isn't a blueskin. That\nthey are constantly scheming to introduce their plague here so most of\nus will die and the rest become blueskins. That's beyond rationalizing.\nIt can't be true, but it's not safe to doubt it.\"\n\n\"Bad business,\" said Calhoun coldly. \"That sort of thing usually costs\nlives, in the end. It could lead to massacre!\"\n\n\"Perhaps it has, in a way,\" said the doctor unhappily. \"One doesn't like\nto think about it.\" He paused, and said; \"Twenty years ago there was a\nfamine on Dara. There were crop-failures. The situation must have been\nvery bad. They built a space-ship. They've no use for such things\nnormally, because no nearby planet will deal with them or let them land.\nBut they built a space-ship and came here. They went in orbit around\nWeald. They asked to trade for shiploads of food. They offered any price\nin heavy metals, gold, platinum, iridium, and so on. They talked from\norbit by vision communicators. They could be seen to be blueskins. You\ncan guess what happened!\"\n\n\"Tell me,\" said Calhoun.\n\n\"We armed ships in a hurry,\" admitted the doctor, \"We chased their\nspace-ship back to Dara. We hung in space off the planet. We told them\nwe'd blast their world from pole to pole if they ever dared take to\nspace again. We made them destroy their one ship, and we watched on\nvisionscreens as it was done.\"\n\n\"But you gave them food?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the doctor ashamedly. \"They were blueskins.\"\n\n\"How bad was the famine?\"\n\n\"Who knows? Any number may have starved! And we kept a squadron of armed\nships in their skies for years. To keep them from spreading the plague,\nwe said. And some of us believed it, probably!\"\n\nThe doctor's tone was purest irony.\n\n\"Lately,\" he said, \"there's been a move for economy in our government.\nSimultaneously, we began to have a series of over-abundant crops. The\ngovernment had to buy the excess grain to keep the price up. Retired\npatrol-ships--built to watch over Dara--were available for\nstorage-space. We filled them up with grain and sent them out into\norbit. They're there now, hundreds of thousands or millions of tons of\ngrain!\"\n\n\"And Dara?\"\n\nThe Doctor shrugged. He stood up.\n\n\"Our hatred of Dara,\" he said, again ironically, \"has produced one\nthing. Roughly halfway between here and Dara there's a two-planet solar\nsystem, Orede. There's a usable planet there. It was proposed to build\nan outpost of Weald there, against blueskins. Cattle were landed to run\nwild and multiply and make a reason for colonists to settle there. They\ndid, but nobody wants to move nearer to blueskins! So Orede stayed\nuninhabited until a hunting-party shooting wild cattle found an\noutcropping of heavy-metal ore. So now there's a mine there. And that's\nall. A few hundred men work the mine at fabulous wages. You may be asked\nto check on their health. But not Dara's!\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Calhoun, frowning.\n\nThe doctor moved toward the Med Ship's exit-port.\n\n\"I answered your questions,\" he said grimly. \"But if I talked to anyone\nelse as I've done to you, I'd be lucky only to be driven into exile!\"\n\n\"I shan't give you away,\" said Calhoun. He did not smile.\n\nWhen the doctor had gone, Calhoun said deliberately;\n\n\"Murgatroyd, you should be grateful that you're a _tormal_ and not a\nman. There's nothing about being a _tormal_ to make you ashamed!\"\n\nThen he grimly changed his garments for the full-dress uniform of the\nMed Service. There was to be a banquet at which he would sit next to the\nplanet's chief executive and hear innumerable speeches about the\nsplendor of Weald. Calhoun had his own, strictly Med Service opinion of\nthe planet's latest and most boasted-of achievement. It was a domed city\nin the polar regions, where nobody ever had to go outdoors. He was less\nthan professionally enthusiastic about the moving streets, and much less\napproving of the dream-broadcasts which supplied hypnotic,\nsleep-inducing rhythms to anybody who chose to listen to them. The price\nwas that while asleep one would hear high praise of commercial products,\nand one might believe them when awake.\n\nBut it was not Calhoun's function to criticize when it could be avoided.\nMed Service had been badly managed in Sector Twelve. So at the banquet\nCalhoun made a brief and diplomatic address in which he temperately\npraised what could be praised, and did not mention anything else.\n\nThe chief executive followed him. As head of the government he paid some\ntribute to the Med Service. But then he reminded his hearers proudly of\nthe high culture, splendid health, and remarkable prosperity of the\nplanet since his political party took office. This, he said, was in\nspite of the need to be perpetually on guard against the greatest and\nmost immediate danger to which any world in all the galaxy was exposed.\nHe referred to the blueskins, of course. He did not need to tell the\npeople of Weald what vigilance, what constant watchfulness was necessary\nagainst that race of depraved and malevolent deviants from the norm of\nhumanity. But Weald, he said with emotion, held aloft the torch of all\nthat humanity held most dear, and defended not alone the lives of its\npeople against blueskin contagion, but their noble heritage of ideals\nagainst Blueskin pollution.\n\nWhen he sat down, Calhoun said very politely;\n\n\"It looks like some day it should be practical politics to urge the\nmassacre of all blueskins. Have you thought of that?\"\n\nThe chief executive said comfortably;\n\n\"The idea's been proposed. It's good politics to urge it, but it would\nbe foolish to carry it out. People vote against blueskins. Wipe them\nout, and where'd you be?\"\n\nCalhoun ground his teeth, quietly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere were more speeches. Then a messenger, white-faced, arrived with a\nwritten note for the chief executive. He read it and passed it to\nCalhoun. It was from the Ministry of Health. The space-port reported\nthat a ship had just broken out from overdrive within the Wealdian\nsolar system. Its tape-transmitter had automatically signalled its\narrival from the mining-planet Orede. But, having sent off its automatic\nsignal, the ship lay dead in space. It did not drive toward Weald. It\ndid not respond to signals. It drifted like a derelict upon no course at\nall. It seemed ominous, and since it came from Orede--the planet nearest\nto Dara of the blueskins--the health ministry informed the planet's\nchief executive.\n\n\"It'll be blueskins,\" said that astute person, firmly. \"They're\nnext-door to Orede. That's who's done this. It wouldn't surprise me if\nthey'd seeded Orede with their plague, and this ship came from there to\ngive us warning!\"\n\n\"There's no evidence for anything of the sort,\" protested Calhoun. \"A\nship simply came out of overdrive and didn't signal further. That's\nall.\"\n\n\"We'll see,\" said the chief executive ominously. \"We'll go directly to\nthe spaceport.\"\n\nCalhoun retrieved Murgatroyd who had been visiting with the wives of the\nhigher-up officials. His small paunch distended with cakes and coffee\nand such delicacies as he'd been plied with. He was half comatose from\nover-feeding and over-petting, but he was glad to see Calhoun. At the\nspaceport they discovered the situation remained unchanged.\n\nA ship from Orede had come out of overdrive and lay dead in emptiness.\nIt did not answer calls. It did not move in space. It floated eerily in\nno orbit around anything, going nowhere; doing nothing. And panic was\nthe consequence.\n\nIt seemed to Calhoun that the official handling of the matter accounted\nfor the terror that he could feel building up. The so-far-unexplained\nbit of news was on the air all over the planet Weald. There was nobody\nawake of all the world's population who did not believe that there was a\nnew danger in the sky. Nobody doubted that it came from blueskins. The\ntreatment of the news was precisely calculated to keep alive the hatred\nof Weald for the inhabitants of the world Dara.\n\nCalhoun put Murgatroyd into the Med Ship and went back to the spaceport\noffice. A small space-boat, designed to inspect the circling grain-ships\nfrom time, was already aloft. The landing-grid had thrust it swiftly out\nmost of the way. Now it droned and drove on sturdily toward the\nenigmatic ship.\n\nCalhoun took no part in the agitated conferences among the officials and\nnews reporters at the space-port. But he listened to the talk about him.\nAs the investigating small ship drew nearer and nearer to the\ndeathly-still cargo vessel, the guesses about the meaning of its\nbreakout and following silence grew more and more wild. But, singularly,\nthere was not one suggestion that the mystery might not be the work of\nblueskins. Blueskins were scapegoats for all the fears and all the\nuneasiness a perhaps over-civilized world developed.\n\nPresently the investigating space-boat reached the mystery ship and\ncircled it, beaming queries. No answer. It reported the cargo-ship dark.\nNo lights shone anywhere on or in it. There were no induction-surges\nfrom even pulsing, idling engines. Delicately, the messenger-craft\nmaneuvered until it touched the silent vessel. It reported that\nmicrophones detected no motion whatever inside.\n\n\"Let a volunteer go aboard,\" commanded the chief executive. \"Have him\nreport what he finds.\"\n\nA pause. Then the solemn announcement of an intrepid volunteer's name,\nfrom far, far away. Calhoun listened, frowning darkly. This pompous\nheroism wouldn't be noticed in the Med Service. It would be routine\nbehavior.\n\nSuspenseful, second-by-second reports. The volunteer had rocketed\nhimself across the emptiness between the two again-separated ships. He\nhad opened the airlock from outside. He'd gone in. He'd closed the outer\nairlock door. He'd opened the inner. He reported.\n\nThe relayed report was almost incoherent, what with horror and\nincredulity and the feeling of doom that came upon the volunteer. The\nship was a bulk-cargo ore-carrier, designed to run between Orede and\nWeald with cargoes of heavy-metal ores and a crew of no more than five\nmen. There was no cargo in her holds now, though. Instead, there were\nmen. They packed the ship. They filled the corridors. They had crawled\ninto every cargo and other space where a man could find room to push\nhimself. There were hundreds of them. It was insanity. And it had been\ngreater insanity still for the ship to have taken off with so\npreposterous a load of living creatures.\n\nBut they weren't living any longer. The air apparatus had been designed\nfor a crew of five. It could purify the air for possibly twenty or more.\nBut there were hundreds of men in hiding as well as in plain view in the\ncargo-ship from Orede. There were many, many times more than her air\napparatus and reserve tanks could possibly have serviced. They couldn't\neven have been fed during the journey from Orede to Weald!\n\nBut they hadn't starved. Air-scarcity killed them before the ship came\nout of overdrive.\n\nA remarkable thing was that there was no written message in the ship's\nlog which referred to its take-off. There was no memorandum of the\ntaking on of such an impossible number of passengers.\n\n\"The blueskins did it,\" said the chief executive of Weald. He was pale.\nAll about Calhoun men looked sick and shocked and terrified. \"It was the\nblueskins! We'll have to teach them a lesson!\" Then he turned to\nCalhoun. \"The volunteer who went on that ship ... He'll have to stay\nthere, won't he? He can't be brought back to Weald without bringing\ncontagion ...\"\n\nCalhoun raged at him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\n\nThere was a certain coldness in the manner of those at the Weald\nspaceport when the Med Ship left next morning. Calhoun was not popular\nbecause Weald was scared. It had been conditioned to scare easily, where\nblueskins might be involved. Its children were trained to react\nexplosively when the word \"blueskin\" was uttered in their hearing, and\nits adults tended to say \"blueskin\" when anything to cause uneasiness\nentered their minds. So a planet-wide habit of non-rational response had\nformed and was not seen to be irrational because almost everybody had\nit.\n\nThe volunteer who'd discovered the tragedy on the ship from Orede was\nsafe, though. He'd made a completely conscientious survey of the ship\nhe'd volunteered to enter and examine. For his courage, he'd have been\ndoomed but for Calhoun. The reaction of his fellow-citizens was that by\nentering the ship he might have become contaminated by blueskin\ninfective material if the plague still existed, and if the men in the\nship had caught it--but they certainly hadn't died of it--and if there\nhad been blueskins on Orede to communicate it--for which there was no\nevidence--and if blueskins were responsible for the tragedy. Which was\nat the moment pure supposition. But Weald feared he might bring death\nback to Weald if he were allowed to return.\n\nCalhoun saved his life. He ordered that the guard-ship admit him to its\nairlock, which then was to be filled with steam and chlorine. The\ncombination would sterilize and partly even eat away his space-suit,\nafter which the chlorine and steam should be bled out to space, and air\nfrom the ship let into the lock. If he stripped off the space-suit\nwithout touching its outer surface, and re\u00ebntered the investigating ship\nwhile the suit was flung outside by a man in another space-suit,\nhandling it with a pole he'd fling after it, there could be no possible\ncontamination brought back.\n\nCalhoun was quite right, but Weald in general considered that he'd\npersuaded the government to take an unreasonable risk.\n\nThere were other reasons for disapproving of him. Calhoun had been\nunpleasantly frank. The coming of the death-ship stirred to frenzy those\npeople who believed that all blueskins should be exterminated as a pious\nact. They'd appeared on every visionscreen, citing not only the ship\nfrom Orede but other incidents which they interpreted as crimes against\nWeald. They demanded that all Wealdian atomic reactors be modified to\nturn out fusion-bomb materials while a space-fleet was made ready for an\nanti-blueskin crusade. They confidently demanded such a rain of\nfusion-bombs on Dara that no blueskin, no animal, no shred of\nvegetation, no fish in the deepest ocean, not even a living\nvirus-particle of the blueskin plague could remain alive on the blueskin\nworld!\n\nOne of these vehement orators even asserted that Calhoun agreed that no\nother course was possible, speaking for the Interstellar Medical\nService. And Calhoun furiously demanded a chance to deny it by\nbroadcast, and he made a bitter and indiscreet speech from which a\nplanet-wide audience inferred that he thought them fools. He did.\n\nSo he was definitely unpopular when his ship lifted from Weald. He'd\ncurtly given his destination as Orede, from which the death-ship had\ncome. The landing-grid locked on, raised the small space-craft until\nWeald was a great shining ball below it, and then somehow scornfully\ncast him off. The Med Ship was free, in clear space where there was not\nenough of a gravitational field to hinder overdrive.\n\nHe aimed for his destination, his face very grim. He said savagely;\n\n\"Get set, Murgatroyd! Overdrive coming!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe thumbed down the overdrive button. The universe of stars went out,\nwhile everything living in the ship felt the customary sensations of\ndizziness, of nausea, and of a spiralling fall to nothingness. Then\nthere was silence. The Med Ship actually moved at a rate which was a\npreposterous number of times the speed of light, but it felt absolutely\nsolid, absolutely firm and fixed. A ship in overdrive feels exactly as\nif it were buried deep in the core of a planet. There is no vibration.\nThere is no sign of anything but solidity and--if one looks out a\nport--there is only utter blackness plus an absence of sound fit to make\none's eardrums crack.\n\nBut within seconds random tiny noises began. There was a reel and there\nwere sound-speakers to keep the ship from sounding like a grave. The\nreel played and the speakers gave off minute creakings, and meaningless\nhums, and very tiny noises of every imaginable sort, all of which were\njust above the threshold of the inaudible.\n\nCalhoun fretted. Sector Twelve was in very bad shape. A conscientious\nMed Service man would never have let the anti-blueskin obsession go\nunmentioned in a report on Weald. Health is not only a physical affair.\nThere is mental health, also. When mental health goes a civilization can\nbe destroyed more surely and more terribly than by any imaginable war or\nplague-germ. A plague kills off those who are susceptible to it, leaving\nimmunes to build up a world again. But immunes are the first to be\nkilled when a mass neurosis sweeps a population.\n\nWeald was definitely a Med Service problem world. Dara was another. And\nwhen hundreds of men jammed themselves into a cargo-boat which could not\nfurnish them with air to breathe, and took off and went into overdrive\nbefore the air could fail.... Orede called for no less of worry.\n\n\"I think,\" said Calhoun dourly, \"that I'll have some coffee.\"\n\n\"Coffee\" was one of the words that Murgatroyd recognized immediately. He\nwould usually watch the coffee-maker with bright, interested eyes. He'd\neven tried to imitate Calhoun's motions with it, once, and had scorched\nhis paws in the attempt. This time he did not move.\n\nCalhoun turned his head. Murgatroyd sat on the floor, his long tail\ncoiled reflectively about a chair-leg. He watched the door of the Med\nShip's sleeping-cabin.\n\n\"Murgatroyd,\" said Calhoun. \"I mentioned coffee!\"\n\n\"_Chee!_\" shrilled Murgatroyd.\n\nBut he continued to look at the door. The temperature was kept lower in\nthe other cabin, and the look of things was different from the\ncontrol-compartment. The difference was part of the means by which a man\nwas able to be alone for weeks on end--alone save for his\n_tormal_--without becoming ship-happy. There were other carefully\nthought out items in the ship with the same purpose. But none of them\nshould cause Murgatroyd to stare fixedly and fascinatedly at the\nsleeping-cabin door. Not when coffee was in the making!\n\nCalhoun considered. He became angry at the immediate suspicion that\noccurred to him. As a Med Service man, he was duty-bound to be\nimpartial. To be impartial might mean not to side absolutely with Weald\nin its enmity to blueskins. The people of Weald had refused to help Dara\nin a time of famine; they'd blockaded that pariah world for years\nafterward; they had other reasons for hating the people they'd treated\nbadly. It was entirely reasonable for some fanatic on Weald to consider\nthat Calhoun must be killed lest he be of help to the blueskins Weald\nabhorred.\n\nIn fact, it was quite possible that somebody had stowed away on the Med\nShip to murder Calhoun, so that there would be no danger of any report\nfavorable to Dara ever being presented anywhere. If so, such a stowaway\nwould be in the sleeping-cabin now, waiting for Calhoun to walk\nunsuspiciously in to be shot dead.\n\nSo Calhoun made coffee. He slipped a blaster into a pocket where it\nwould be handy. He filled a small cup for Murgatroyd and a large one for\nhimself, and then a second large one.\n\nHe tapped on the sleeping-cabin door, standing aside lest a blaster-bolt\ncame through it.\n\n\"Coffee's ready,\" he said sardonically. \"Come out and join us.\"\n\nThere was a long pause. Calhoun rapped again.\n\n\"You've a seat at the captain's table,\" he said more sardonically still.\n\"It's not polite to keep me waiting!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe listened, alert for a rush which would be a fanatic's desperate\nattempt to do murder despite premature discovery. He was prepared to\nshoot quite ruthlessly.\n\nBut there was no rush. Instead, there came hesitant foot-falls. The door\nof the cabin slid slowly aside. A girl appeared in the opening,\ndesperately white and desperately composed.\n\n\"H-how did you know I was there?\" she asked shakily. She moistened her\nlips. \"You didn't see me! I was in a closet, and you didn't even enter\nthe room!\"\n\nCalhoun said grimly;\n\n\"I've sources of information.\" He pointed to Murgatroyd.\n\nThe girl did not move. Her eyes went from Murgatroyd to Calhoun.\n\n\"And now,\" said Calhoun, \"do you want to tell me your story? You have\none ready, I'm sure.\"\n\n\"There--there isn't any,\" said the girl unsteadily. \"Just--I--I need to\nget to Orede, and you're going there. There's no other way to go--now.\"\n\n\"To the contrary,\" said Calhoun, \"there'll undoubtedly be a fleet\nheading for Orede as soon as it can be assembled and armed. But I'm\nafraid that's not a very good story. Try another.\"\n\nShe shivered a little.\n\n\"I'm--running away ...\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Calhoun. \"In that case I'll take you back.\"\n\n\"No!\" she said fiercely. \"I'll--I'll die first! I'll wreck this ship\nfirst!\"\n\nHer hand came from behind her. There was a tiny blaster in it. But it\nshook visibly as she tried to aim it.\n\n\"I'll--shoot out the controls!\"\n\nCalhoun blinked. He'd had to make a drastic change in his estimate of\nthe situation the instant he saw that the stowaway was a girl. Now he\nhad to make another when her threat was not to kill him but to disable\nthe ship. Women are rarely assassins, and when they are they don't use\nenergy weapons. Daggers and poisons are more typical.\n\n\"I'd rather you didn't do that,\" said Calhoun drily. \"Besides, you'd get\ndeadly bored if we were stuck in a derelict waiting for our air and food\nto give out.\"\n\nMurgatroyd, for no reason whatever, felt it necessary to enter the\nconversation. He said;\n\n\"_Chee-chee-chee!_\"\n\n\"A very sensible suggestion,\" observed Calhoun. \"We'll sit down and have\na cup of coffee.\" To the girl he said, \"I'll take you to Orede, since\nthat's where you say you want to go.\"\n\n\"I--there's a boy there--\"\n\nCalhoun shook his head.\n\n\"No,\" he said reprovingly. \"Nearly all the mining colony had packed\nitself into the ship that came into Weald with everybody dead. But not\nall. And there's been no check of what men were in the ship and what men\nweren't. You wouldn't go to Orede if it were likely your fellow had died\non the way to you. Here's your coffee. Sugar or saccho, and do you take\ncream?\"\n\nShe trembled a little, but she took the cup.\n\n\"I--don't understand--.\"\n\n\"Murgatroyd and I,\" explained Calhoun--and he did not know whether he\nspoke out of anger or something else--\"we are do-gooders. We go around\ntrying to keep people from getting killed. It's our profession. We\npractise it even on our own behalf. We want to stay alive. So since you\nmake such drastic threats, we will take you where you want to go.\nEspecially since we're going there anyhow.\"\n\n\"You--don't believe anything I've said!\" It was a statement.\n\n\"Not a word,\" admitted Calhoun. \"But you'll probably tell us something\nmore believable presently. When did you eat last?\"\n\n\"Yesterday--.\"\n\n\"Better have something now. We'll talk more later.\" Calhoun showed her\nhow to punch the readier for such-and-such dishes, to be extracted from\nstorage and warmed or chilled, as the case might be, and served at\ndialed-for intervals.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCalhoun deliberately immersed himself in the Galactic Directory, looking\nup the planet Orede. He was headed there, but he'd had no reason to\ninform himself about it before. Now he read with every appearance of\nabsorption.\n\nThe girl ate daintily. Murgatroyd watched with highly amiable interest.\nBut she looked acutely uncomfortable.\n\nCalhoun finished with the Directory. He got out the microfilm reels\nwhich contained more information. He was specifically after the Med\nService history of all the planets in this sector. He went through the\nfilmed record of every inspection ever made on Weald and on Dara. But\nSector Twelve had not been well-run. There was no adequate account of a\nplague which had wiped out three-quarters of the population of an\ninhabited planet! It had happened shortly after one Med Ship visit, and\nwas over before another Med Ship came by. But there should have been\npainstaking investigation, even after the fact. There should have been a\ncollection of infective material and a reasonably complete\nidentification and study of the infective agent. It hadn't been made.\nThere was probably some other emergency at the time, and it slipped by.\nBut Calhoun--whose career was not to be spent in this sector--resolved\non a blistering report about this negligence and its consequences.\n\nHe kept himself casually busy, ignoring the girl. A Med Ship man has\nresources of study and meditation with which to occupy himself during\noverdrive travel from one planet to another. Calhoun made use of those\nresources. He acted as if he were completely unconscious of the\nstowaway. But Murgatroyd watched her with charmed attention.\n\nHours after her discovery, she said uneasily;\n\n\"Please?\"\n\nCalhoun looked up.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"I--don't know exactly how things stand.\"\n\n\"You are a stowaway,\" said Calhoun. \"Legally, I have the right to put\nyou out the airlock. It doesn't seem necessary. There's a cabin. When\nyou're sleepy, use it. Murgatroyd and I can make out quite well here.\nWhen you're hungry, you now know how to get something to eat. When we\nland on Orede, you'll probably go about whatever business you have\nthere. That's all.\"\n\nShe stared at him.\n\n\"But--you don't believe what I've told you!\"\n\n\"No,\" agreed Calhoun. But he didn't add to the statement.\n\n\"But--I will tell you,\" she offered. \"The police were after me. I had to\nget away from Weald! I had to! I'd stolen--\"\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"No,\" he said. \"If you were a thief, you'd say anything in the world\nexcept that you were a thief. You're not ready to tell the truth yet.\nYou don't have to, so why tell me anything? I suggest that you get some\nsleep.\"\n\nShe rose slowly. Twice her lips parted as if to speak again, but then\nshe went into the other cabin and closed herself in.\n\nMurgatroyd blinked at the place where she'd disappeared and then climbed\nup into Calhoun's lap, with complete assurance of welcome. He settled\nhimself and was silent for moments. Then he said;\n\n\"_Chee!_\"\n\n\"I believe you're right,\" said Calhoun. \"She doesn't belong on Weald, or\nwith the conditioning she'd have had, there'd be only one place she'd\ndread worse than Orede, and that would be Dara. But I doubt she'd be\nafraid to land even on Dara.\"\n\nMurgatroyd liked to be talked to. He liked to pretend that he carried on\na conversation, like humans.\n\n\"_Chee-chee!_\" he said with conviction.\n\n\"Definitely,\" agreed Calhoun. \"She's not doing this for her personal\nadvantage. Whatever she thinks she's doing, it's more important to her\nthan her own life. Murgatroyd--\"\n\n\"_Chee?_\" said Murgatroyd in an inquiring tone.\n\n\"There are wild cattle on Orede,\" said Calhoun. \"Herds and herds of\nthem. I have a suspicion that somebody's been shooting them. Lots of\nthem. Do you agree? Don't you think that a lot of cattle have been\nslaughtered on Orede lately?\"\n\nMurgatroyd yawned. He settled himself still more comfortably in\nCalhoun's lap.\n\n\"_Chee,_\" he said drowsily.\n\nHe went to sleep, while Calhoun continued the examination of highly\ncondensed information. Presently he looked up the normal rate of\nincrease, with other data, among herds of _bivis domesticus_ in a wild\nstate, on planets where they have no natural enemies. It wasn't\nunheard-of for a world to be stocked with useful types of Terran fauna\nand flora before it was attempted to be colonized. Terran life-forms\ncould play the devil with alien ecological systems, very much to\nhumanity's benefit. Familiar micro\u00f6rganisms and a standard vegetation\nadded to the practicality of human settlements on otherwise alien\nworlds. But sometimes the results were strange.\n\nThey weren't often so strange, however, as to cause some hundreds of men\nto pack themselves frantically aboard a cargo-ship which couldn't\npossibly sustain them, so that every man must die while the ship was in\noverdrive.\n\nStill, by the time Calhoun turned in on a spare pneumatic mattress, he\nhad calculated that as few as a dozen head of cattle, turned loose on a\nsuitable planet, would have increased to herds of thousands or tens or\neven hundreds of thousands in much less time than had probably elapsed.\n\nThe Med Ship drove on in seemingly absolute solidity, with no sound from\nwithout, with no sight to be seen outside, with no evidence at all that\nit was not buried deep in the heart of a planet instead of flashing\nthrough emptiness at a speed so great as to have no meaning.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNext ship-day the girl looked oddly at Calhoun when she appeared in the\ncontrol-room. \"Shall I--have breakfast?\" she asked uncertainly.\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\nSilently, she operated the food-readier. She ate. Calhoun gave the\nimpression that he would respond politely when spoken to, but that he\nwas busy with activities that kept him remote from stowaways.\n\nAbout noon, ship-time, she asked;\n\n\"When will we get to Orede?\"\n\nCalhoun told her absently, as if he were thinking of something else.\n\n\"What--what do you think happened there? I mean, to make that tragedy in\nthe ship?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Calhoun. \"But I disagree with the authorities on\nWeald. I don't think it was a planned atrocity of the blueskins.\"\n\n\"Wh-what are blueskins?\"\n\nCalhoun turned around and looked at her directly.\n\n\"When lying,\" he said mildly, \"you tell as much by what you pretend\nisn't, as by what you pretend is. You know what blueskins are!\"\n\n\"B--but what do you think they are?\" she asked.\n\n\"There used to be a human disease called smallpox,\" said Calhoun. \"When\npeople recovered from it, they were usually marked. Their skin had\nlittle scar-pits here and there. At one time, back on Earth, it was\nexpected that everybody would catch smallpox sooner or later, and a\nlarge percentage would die of it. And it was so much a matter of course\nthat if they printed a description of a criminal, they never mentioned\nit if he were pock-marked--scarred. It was no distinction. But if he\ndidn't have the markings, they'd mention that!\" He paused. \"Those\npock-marks weren't hereditary, but otherwise a blueskin is like a man\nwho had them. He can't be anything else!\"\n\n\"Then you think they're--human?\"\n\n\"There's never yet been a case of reverse evolution,\" said Calhoun.\n\"Maybe pithecanthropus had a monkey uncle, but no pithecanthropus ever\nwent monkey.\"\n\nShe turned abruptly away. But she glanced at him often during that day.\nHe continued to busy himself with those activities which make a Med\nShip man's life consistent with retained sanity.\n\nNext day she asked without preliminary;\n\n\"Don't you believe the blueskins planned for the ship with the dead men\nto arrive at Weald and spread plague there?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Calhoun.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"It couldn't possibly work,\" Calhoun told her. \"With only dead men on\nboard, the ship wouldn't arrive at a place where the landing-grid could\nbring it down. So that would be no good. And plague-stricken living men\nwouldn't try to conceal that they had the plague. They might ask for\nhelp, but they'd know they'd instantly be killed on Weald if they were\nfound to be plague-victims. So that would be no good, either! No, the\nship wasn't intended to land plague on Weald.\"\n\n\"Are you--friendly to blueskins?\" she asked uncertainly.\n\n\"Within reason,\" said Calhoun, \"I am a well-wisher to all the human\nrace. You're slipping, though. When using the word 'blueskin' you should\nsay it uncomfortably, as if it were a word no refined person liked to\npronounce. You don't. We'll land on Orede tomorrow, by the way. If you\never intend to tell me the truth, there's not much time.\"\n\nShe bit her lips. Twice, during the remainder of the day, she faced him\nand opened her mouth as if to speak, and then turned away again. Calhoun\nshrugged. He had fairly definite ideas about her, by now. He carefully\nkept them tentative, but no girl born and raised on Weald would\nwillingly go to Orede, with all of Weald believing that a shipload of\nminers preferred death to remaining there. It tied in, like everything\nelse that was unpleasant, to blueskins. Nobody from Weald would dream of\nlanding on Orede! Not now!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA little before the Med Ship was due to break out from overdrive, the\ngirl said very carefully;\n\n\"You've been--very kind. I'd like to thank you. I--didn't really believe\nI would--live to get to Orede.\"\n\nCalhoun raised his eyebrows.\n\n\"I--wish I could tell you everything you want to know,\" she added\nregretfully. \"I think you're--really decent. But some things....\"\n\nCalhoun said caustically;\n\n\"You've told me a great deal. You weren't born on Weald. You weren't\nraised there. The people of Dara--notice that I don't say blueskins,\nthough they are--the people of Dara have made at least one space-ship\nsince Weald threatened them with extermination. There is probably a new\nfood-shortage on Dara now, leading to pure desperation. Most likely it's\nbad enough to make them risk landing on Orede to kill cattle and freeze\nbeef to help. They've worked out.\"\n\nShe gasped and sprang to her feet. She snatched out the tiny blaster in\nher pocket. She pointed it waveringly at him.\n\n\"I--have to kill you!\" she cried desperately. \"I--I have to!\"\n\nCalhoun reached out. She tugged despairingly at the blaster's trigger.\nNothing happened. Before she could realize that she hadn't turned off\nthe safety, Calhoun twisted the weapon from her fingers. He stepped\nback.\n\n\"Good girl!\" he said approvingly. \"I'll give this back to you when we\nland. And thanks. Thanks very much!\"\n\nShe stared at him. \"Thanks? When I tried to kill you?\"\n\n\"Of course!\" said Calhoun. \"I'd made guesses. I couldn't know that they\nwere right. When you tried to kill me, you confirmed every one. Now,\nwhen we land on Orede I'm going to get you to try to put me in touch\nwith your friends. It's going to be tricky, because they must be pretty\nwell scared about that ship. But it's a highly desirable thing to get\ndone!\"\n\nHe went to the ship's control-board and sat down before it.\n\n\"Twenty minutes to break-hour,\" he observed.\n\nMurgatroyd peered out of his little cubbyhole. His eyes were anxious.\n_Tormals_ are amiable little creatures. During the days in overdrive,\nCalhoun had paid less than the usual amount of attention to Murgatroyd,\nwhile the girl was fascinating. They'd made friends, awkwardly on the\ngirl's part, very pleasantly on Murgatroyd's. But only moments ago there\nhad been bitter emotion in the air. Murgatroyd had fled to his cubbyhole\nto escape it. He was distressed. Now that there was silence again, he\npeered out unhappily.\n\n\"_Chee?_\" he queried plaintively. \"_Chee-chee-chee?_\"\n\nCalhoun said matter-of-factly;\n\n\"It's all right, Murgatroyd. If we aren't blasted as we try to land, we\nshould be able to make friends with everybody and get something\naccomplished.\"\n\nThe statement was hopelessly inaccurate.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\n\nThere was no answer from the ground when breakout came and Calhoun drove\nthe Med Ship to a favorable position for a call. He patiently repeated,\nover and over again, that Med Ship Aesclipus Twenty notified its arrival\nand requested co\u00f6rdinates for landing. There should have been a crisp\ndescription of the direction from the planet's center at which, a\ncertain time so many hours or minutes later, the force-fields of the\ngrid would find it convenient to lock onto and lower the Med Ship. But\nthe communicator remained silent.\n\n\"There is a landing-grid,\" said Calhoun, frowning, \"and if they're using\nit to load fresh meat for Dara, from the herds I'm told about, it should\nbe manned. But they don't seem to intend to answer. Maybe they think\nthat if they pretend I'm not here I'll go away.\"\n\nHe reflected, and his frown deepened.\n\n\"If I didn't know what I do know, I might. So if I land on\nemergency-rockets the blueskins down below may decide that I come from\nWeald. And in that case it would be reasonable to blast me before I\ncould land and unload some fighting men. On the other hand, no ship from\nWeald would conceivably land without impassioned assurance that it was\nsafe. It would drop bombs.\" He turned to the girl. \"How many Darians\ndown below?\"\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n\"You don't know,\" said Calhoun, \"or won't tell, yet. But they ought to\nbe told about the arrival of that ship at Weald, and what Weald thinks\nabout it! My guess is that you came to tell them. It isn't likely that\nDara gets news direct from Weald. Where were you put ashore from Dara,\nwhen you set out to be a spy?\"\n\nHer lips parted to speak. But she compressed them tightly. She shook her\nhead again.\n\n\"It must have been plenty far away,\" said Calhoun restlessly. \"Your\npeople would have built a ship, and made fine forged papers for it, and\nthey'd travel so far from this part of space that when they landed\nnobody would think of Dara. They'd use makeup to cover the blue spots,\nbut maybe it was so far away that blueskins had never been heard of!\"\n\nHer face looked pinched, but she did not reply.\n\n\"Then they'd land half a dozen of you, with a supply of makeup for the\nblue patches. And you'd separate, and take ships that went various\nroundabout ways, and arrive on Weald one by one, to see what could be\ndone there to....\" He stopped. \"When did you find out positively that\nthere wasn't any plague any more?\"\n\nShe began to grow pale.\n\n\"I'm not a mind-reader,\" said Calhoun. \"But it adds up. You're from\nDara. You've been on Weald. It's practically certain that there are\nother, agents, if you like that word better, on Weald. And there hasn't\nbeen a plague on Weald so you people aren't carriers of it. But you\nknew it in advance, I think. How'd you learn? Did a ship in some sort of\ntrouble land there, on Dara?\"\n\n\"Y-yes,\" said the girl. \"We wouldn't let it go again. But the people\ndidn't catch--they didn't die--they lived--.\"\n\nShe stopped short.\n\n\"It's not fair to trap me!\" she cried passionately, \"It's not fair!\"\n\n\"I'll stop,\" said Calhoun.\n\nHe turned to the control-board. The Med Ship was only planetary\ndiameters from Orede, now, and the electron telescope showed shining\nstars in leisurely motion across its screen. Then a huge, gibbous\nshining shape appeared, and there were irregular patches of that muddy\ncolor which is sea-bottom, and varicolored areas which were plains and\nforests. Also there were mountains. Calhoun steadied the image and\nsquinted at it.\n\n\"The mine,\" he observed, \"was found by members of a hunting-party,\nkilling wild cattle for sport.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEven a small planet has many millions of square miles of surface, and a\nsingle human installation on a whole world will not be easy to find by\nrandom search. But there were clues to this one. Men hunting for sport\nwould not choose a tropic nor an arctic climate to hunt in. So if they\nfound a mineral deposit, it would have been in a temperate zone. Cattle\nwould not be found deep in a mountainous terrain. The mine would not be\non a prairie. The settlement on Orede, then, would be near the edge of\nmountains, not far from a prairie such as wild cattle would frequent,\nand it would be in a temperate climate. Forested areas could be ruled\nout. And there would be a landing-grid. Handling only one ship at a\ntime, it might be a very small grid. It need be only hundreds of yards\nacross and less than half a mile high. But its shadow would be\ndistinctive.\n\nCalhoun searched among low mountains near unforested prairie in a\ntemperate zone. He found a speck. He enlarged it many-fold, and it was\nthe mine on Orede. There were heaps of tailings. There was something\nwhich cast a long, lacy shadow. The landing-grid.\n\n\"But they don't answer our call,\" observed Calhoun, \"so we go down\nunwelcomed.\"\n\nHe inverted the Med Ship and the emergency-rockets boomed. The ship\nplunged planetward.\n\nA long time later it was deep in the planet's atmosphere. The noise of\nits rockets had become thunderous, with air to carry and to reinforce\nthe sound.\n\n\"Hold on to something, Murgatroyd,\" commanded Calhoun. \"We may have to\ndodge some ack.\"\n\nBut nothing came up from below. The Med Ship again inverted itself, and\nits rockets pointed toward the planet and poured out pencil-thin,\nblue-white, high-velocity flames. It checked slightly, but continued to\ndescend. It was not directly above the grid. It swept downward until\nalmost level with the peaks of the mountains in which the mine lay. It\ntilted again, and swept onward over the mountain-tops, and then tilted\nonce more and went racing up the valley in which the landing-grid was\nplainly visible. Calhoun swung it on an erratic course, lest there be\nopposition.\n\nBut there was no sign. Then the rockets bellowed, and the ship slowed\nits forward motion, hovered momentarily, and settled to solidity outside\nthe framework of the grid. The grid was small, as Calhoun reasoned. But\nit reached interminably toward the sky.\n\nThe rocket cut off. Slender as the flame had been, they'd melted and\nbored thin drill-holes deep into the soil. Molten rock boiled and\nbubbled down below. But there seemed no other sound. There was no other\nmotion. There was absolute stillness all around. But when Calhoun\nswitched on the outside microphones a faint, sweet melange of\nhigh-pitched chirpings came from tiny creatures hidden under the\nvegetation of the mountainsides.\n\nCalhoun put a blaster in his pocket and stood up.\n\n\"We'll see what it looks like outside,\" he said with a certain grimness.\n\"I don't quite believe what the visionscreens show.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMinutes later he stepped down to the ground from the Med Ship's\nexit-port. The ship had landed perhaps a hundred feet from what once had\nbeen a wooden building. In it, ore from the mines was concentrated and\nthe useless tailings carried away by a conveyor-belt to make a monstrous\npile of broken stone. But there was no longer a building. Next to it\nthere had been a structure containing an ore-crusher. The massive\nmachinery could still be seen, but the structure was fragments. Next to\nthat, again, had been the shaft-head shelters of the mine. They also\nwere shattered practically to match-sticks.\n\nThe look of the ground about the building-sites was simply and purely\nimpossible. It was a mass of hoofprints. Cattle by thousands and tens of\nthousands had trampled everything. Cattle had burst in the wooden sides\nof the buildings. Cattle had piled themselves up against the beams\nupholding roofs until the buildings collapsed. Then cattle had gone\nplunging over the wrecked buildings until there was nothing left but\nindescribable chaos. Many, many cattle had died in the crush. There were\nheaps of dead beasts about the metal girders which were the foundation\nof the landing-grid. The air was tainted by the smell of carrion.\n\nThe settlement had been destroyed, positively, by stampeded cattle in\ntens or hundreds of thousands charging blindly through and over and upon\nit. Senselessly, they'd trampled each other to horrible shapelessnesses.\nThe mine-shaft was not choked, because enormously strong timbers had\nfallen across and blocked it. But everything else was pure destruction.\n\nCalhoun said evenly;\n\n\"Clever! Very clever! You can't blame men when beasts stampede! We\nshould accept the evidence that some monstrous herd, making its way\nthrough a mountain pass, somehow went crazy and bolted for the plains\nand this settlement got in the way and it was too bad for the\nsettlement. Everything's explained, except the ship that went to Weald.\nA cattle stampede, yes. Anybody can believe that! But there was a\nman-stampede! Men stampeded into the ship as blindly as the cattle\ntrampled down this little town. The ship stampeded off into space as\ninsanely as the cattle. But a stampede of men _and_ cattle, in the same\nplace,--that's a little too much at one time!\"\n\n\"How,\" asked Calhoun directly, \"do you intend to get in touch with your\nfriends here?\"\n\n\"I--I don't know,\" she said distressedly. \"But if--the ship stays here,\nthey're bound to come and see why. Won't they? Or will they?\"\n\n\"If they're sane, they won't,\" said Calhoun. \"The one undesirable thing,\nhere, would be human footprints on top of cattle-tracks. If your friends\nare a meat-getting party from Dara, as I believe, they should cover up\ntheir tracks, get off-planet as fast as possible, and pray that no signs\nof their former presence are ever discovered. That would be their best\nfirst move, certainly!\"\n\n\"What should I do?\" she asked helplessly.\n\n\"I'm far from sure. At a guess, and for the moment, probably nothing.\nI'll work something out ... I've got the devil of a job before me,\nthough. I can't spend too much time here.\"\n\n\"You can--leave me here....\"\n\nHe grunted and turned away. It was naturally unthinkable that he should\nleave another human being on a supposedly uninhabited planet, with the\nknowledge that it might actually be uninhabited, and the further\nknowledge that any visitors would have the strongest of possible reasons\nto hide themselves away.\n\nHe believed that there were Darians here, and the girl in the Med\nship--so he also believed--was a Darian. But any who might be hiding had\nso much to lose if they were discovered that they might be hundreds or\neven thousands of miles from anywhere a space-ship would normally\nland--if they hadn't fled after the incident of the space-ship's\ndeparture with its load of doomed passengers.\n\nConsidered detachedly, the odds were that there was again a\nfood-shortage on Dara. That blueskins, in desperation, had raided or\nwere raiding or would raid the cattle-herds of Orede for food to carry\nback to their home planet. That somehow the miners on Orede had found\nthat they had blueskin neighbors, and died of the consequences of their\nterror. It was a risky guess to make on such evidence as Calhoun\nconsidered he had, but no other guess was possible.\n\nIf his guess was right, he was under some obligation to do exactly what\nhe believed the girl considered her mission, to warn all blueskins that\nWeald would presently try to find them on Orede, when all hell must\nbreak loose upon Dara for punishment. But if there were men here, he\ncouldn't leave a written warning for them in default of friendly\ncontact. They might not find it, and a search-party of Wealdians might.\nAll he could possibly do was try to make contact and give warning by\nsuch means as would leave no evidence behind that he'd done so. Weald\nwould consider a warning sure proof of blueskin guilt.\n\nIt was not satisfactory to be limited to broadcasts which might not be\npicked up, and were unlikely to be acknowledged. But he settled down\nwith the communicator to make the attempt.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe called first on a GC wave-length and form. It was unlikely that\nblueskins would use general-communication bands to keep in touch with\neach other, but it had to be tried. He broadcast, as broadly tuned as\npossible, and went up and down the GC spectrum, repeating his warning\npainstakingly and listening without hope for a reply. He did find one\nspot on the dial where there was re-radiation of his message, as if from\na tuned receiver. But he could not get a fix on it, and nobody might be\nlistening. He exhausted the normal communication pattern. Then he\nbroadcast on old-fashioned amplitude modulation which a modern\ncommunicator would not pick up at all, and which therefore might be used\nby men in hiding.\n\nHe worked for a long time. Then he shrugged and gave it up. He'd\nrepeated to absolute tedium the facts that any Darians--blueskins--on\nOrede ought to know. There'd been no answer. And it was all too likely\nthat if he'd been received, that those who heard him took his message\nfor a trick to discover if there were any hearers.\n\nHe clicked off at last and stood up, shaking his head. Suddenly the Med\nShip seemed empty. Then he saw Murgatroyd staring at the exit-port. The\ninner door of that small airlock was closed. The tell-tale said the\nouter was not locked. Someone had gone out, quietly. The girl. Of\ncourse. Calhoun said angrily;\n\n\"How long ago, Murgatroyd?\"\n\n\"_Chee!_\" said Murgatroyd indignantly.\n\nIt wasn't an answer, but it showed that Murgatroyd was vexed that he'd\nbeen left behind. He and the girl were close friends, now. If she'd left\nMurgatroyd in the ship when he wanted to go with her, she wasn't coming\nback.\n\nCalhoun swore. Then he made certain. She was not in the ship. He flipped\nthe outside-speaker switch and said curtly into the microphone;\n\n\"Coffee! Murgatroyd and I are having coffee. Will you come back,\nplease?\"\n\nHe repeated the call, and repeated it again. Multiplied as his voice was\nby the speakers, she should hear him within a mile. She did not appear.\nHe went to a small and inconspicuous closet and armed himself. A Med\nShip man was not ever expected to fight, but there were blast-rifles\navailable for extreme emergency.\n\nWhen he'd slung a power-pack over his shoulder and reached the airlock,\nthere was still no sign of his late stowaway. He stood in the airlock\ndoor for long minutes, staring angrily about. Almost certainly she\nwouldn't be looking in the mountains for men of Dara come here for\ncattle. He used a pair of binoculars, first at low-magnification to\nsearch as wide an area down-valley as possible, and then at highest\npower to search the most likely routes.\n\nHe found a small, bobbing speck beyond a far-away hillcrest. It was her\nhead. It went down below the hilltop.\n\nHe snapped a command to Murgatroyd, and when the _tormal_ was on the\nground outside, he locked the port with that combination that nobody but\na Med Ship man was at all likely to discover or use.\n\n\"She's an idiot!\" he told Murgatroyd sourly. \"Come along! We've got to\nbe idiots too!\"\n\nHe set out in pursuit.\n\nThe girl had a long start. Twice Calhoun came to places where she could\nhave chosen either of two ways onward. Each time he had to determine\nwhich she'd followed. That cost time. Then the mountains ended,\nabruptly, and a vast undulating plain stretched away to the horizon.\nThere were at least two large masses and many smaller clumps of what\ncould only be animals gathered together. Cattle.\n\nBut here the girl was plainly in view. Calhoun increased his stride. He\nbegan to gain on her. She did not look behind.\n\nMurgatroyd said \"_Chee!_\" in a complaining tone.\n\n\"I should have left you behind,\" agreed Calhoun dourly, \"but there was\nand is a chance I won't get back. You'll have to keep on hiking.\"\n\nHe plodded on. His memory of the terrain around the mining settlement\ntold him that there was no definite destination in the girl's mind. But\nshe was in no such despair as to want deliberately to be lost. She'd\nguessed, Calhoun believed, that if there were Darians on the planet,\nthey'd keep the landing-grid under observation. If they saw her leave\nthat area and could see that she was alone, they should intercept her to\nfind out the meaning of the Med Ship's landing. Then she could identify\nherself as one of them and give them the terribly necessary warning of\nWeald's suspicions.\n\n\"But,\" said Calhoun sourly, \"if she's right, they'll have seen me\nmarching after her now, which spoils her scheme. And I'd like to help\nit, but the way she's going is too dangerous!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe went down into one of the hollows of the uneven plain. He saw a clump\nof a dozen or so cattle a little distance away. The bull looked up and\nsnorted. The cows regarded him truculently. Their air was not one of\nbovine tranquility.\n\nHe was up the farther hillside and out of sight before the bull worked\nhimself up to a charge. Then Calhoun suddenly remembered one of the\nitems in the data about cattle he'd looked into just the other day. He\nfelt himself grow pale.\n\n\"Murgatroyd!\" he said sharply. \"We've got to catch up! Fast! Stay with\nme if you can, but ...\" He was jog-trotting as he spoke--\"even if you\nget lost I have to hurry!\"\n\nHe ran fifty paces and walked fifty paces. He ran fifty and walked\nfifty. He saw her, atop a rolling of the ground. She came to a full\nstop. He ran. He saw her turn to retrace her steps. He flung to the\nsafety of the blast-rifle and let off a roaring blast at the ground for\nher to hear.\n\nSuddenly she was fleeing desperately, toward him. He plunged on. She\nvanished down into a hollow. Horns appeared over the hillcrest she'd\njust left. Cattle appeared. Four--a dozen--fifteen--twenty. They moved\nominously in her wake. He saw her again, running frantically over\nanother upward swell of the prairie. He let off another blast to guide\nher. He ran on at top speed with Murgatroyd trailing anxiously behind.\nFrom time to time Murgatroyd called \"_Chee-chee-chee!_\" in frightened\npleading not to be abandoned.\n\nMore cattle appeared against the horizon. Fifty or a hundred. They came\nafter the first clump. The first-seen group of a bull and his harem were\nmoving faster, now. The girl fled from them, but it is the instinct of\nbeef-cattle on the open range--Calhoun had learned it only two days\nbefore--to charge any human they find on foot. A mounted man to their\ndim minds is a creature to be tolerated or fled from, but a human on\nfoot is to be crushed and stamped and gored.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThose in the lead were definitely charging now, with heads bent low. The\nbull charged furiously with shut eyes, as bulls do, but the\nmany-times-more-deadly cows charged with their eyes wide open and\nwickedly alert, and with a lumbering speed much greater than the girl\ncould manage.\n\nShe came up over the last rise, chalky-white and gasping, her hair\nflying, in the last extremity of terror. The nearest of the pursuing\ncattle were within ten yards when Calhoun fired from twenty yards\nbeyond. One creature bellowed as the blast-bolt struck. It went down and\nothers crashed into it and swept over it, and more came on. The girl saw\nCalhoun, now, and ran toward him, panting, and he knelt very\ndeliberately and began to check the charge by shooting the leading\nanimals.\n\nHe did not succeed. There were more cattle following the first, and more\nand more behind them. It appeared that all the cattle on the plain\njoined in the blind and senseless charge. The thudding of hooves became\na mutter and then a rumble and then a growl. Plunging, clumsy figures\nrushed past on either side. But horns and heads heaved up over the mound\nof animals Calhoun had shot. He shot them too. More and more cattle came\npounding past the rampart of his victims, but always, it seemed, some\nelected to climb the heap of their dead and dying fellows, and Calhoun\nshot and shot.\n\nBut he split the herd. The foremost animals had been charging a sighted\nhuman enemy. Others had followed because it is the instinct of cattle to\njoin their running fellows in whatever crazed urgency they feel. There\nwas a dense, pounding, horrible mass of running bulls and cows and\ncalves; bellowing, wailing, grunting, puffing, raising thick and\nimpenetrable clouds of dust which had everything but galloping beasts\ngoing past on either side.\n\nIt lasted for minutes. Then the thunder of hooves diminished. It ended\nabruptly, and Calhoun and the girl were left alone with the gruesome\npile of animals which had divided the charging herd into two parts. They\ncould see the rears of innumerable running animals, stupidly continuing\nthe charge--hardly different, now, from a stampede--whose original\nobjective none now remembered.\n\nCalhoun thoughtfully touched the barrel of his blast-rifle and winced at\nits scorching heat.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I just realized,\" he said coldly, \"that I don't know your name. What is\nit?\"\n\n\"M-maril,\" said the girl. She swallowed. \"Th-thank you--.\"\n\n\"Maril,\" said Calhoun, \"you are an idiot! It was half-witted at best to\ngo off by yourself! You could have been lost! You could have cost me\ndays of hunting for you, days badly needed for more important matters!\"\nHe stopped and took breath. \"You may have spoiled what little chance\nI've got to do something about the plans Weald's already making!\"\n\nHe said more bitterly still;\n\n\"And I had to leave Murgatroyd behind to get to you in time! He was\nright in the path of that charge!\"\n\nHe turned away from her and said dourly;\n\n\"All right! Come on back to the ship. We'll go to Dara. We'd have to,\nanyhow. But Murgatroyd--\"\n\nThen he heard a very small sneeze. Out of a rolling wall of\nstill-roiling dust, Murgatroyd appeared forlornly. He was dust-covered,\nand draggled, and his tail drooped, and he sneezed again. He moved as if\nhe could barely put one paw before another, but at the sight of Calhoun\nhe sneezed yet again and said, \"_Chee!_\" in a disconsolate voice. Then\nhe sat down and waited for Calhoun to pick him up.\n\nWhen Calhoun did so, Murgatroyd clung to him pathetically and said,\n\"_Chee-chee!_\" and again \"_Chee-chee!_\" with the intonation of one\ntelling of incredible horrors and disasters endured.\n\nCalhoun headed back for the valley, the settlement and the Med Ship.\nMurgatroyd clung to his neck. The girl Maril followed visibly shaken.\n\nCalhoun did not speak to her again. He led the way. A mile back toward\nthe mountains, they began to see stragglers from the now-vanished herd.\nA little further, those stragglers began to notice them. And it would\nhave been a matter of no moment if they'd been domesticated\ndairy-cattle, but these were range-cattle gone wild. Twice, Calhoun had\nto use his blast-rifle to discourage incipient charges by irritated\nbulls or even more irritated cows. Those with calves darkly suspected\nCalhoun of designs upon their offspring.\n\nIt was a relief to enter the valley again. But it was two miles more to\nthe landing-grid with the Med Ship beside it and the reek of carrion in\nthe air.\n\nThey were perhaps two hundred feet from the ship when a blast-rifle\ncrashed and its bolt whined past Calhoun so close that he felt the\nmonstrous heat. There had been no challenge. There was no warning. There\nwas simply a shot which came horribly close to ending Calhoun's career\nin a completely arbitrary fashion.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\n\nFive minutes later Calhoun had located one would-be killer behind a mass\nof splintered planking that once had been a wall. He set the wood afire\nby a blaster-bolt and then viciously sent other bolts all around the man\nit had sheltered when he fled from the flames. He could have killed him\nten times over, but it was more desirable to open communication. So he\nmissed, intentionally.\n\nMaril had cried out that she came from Dara and had word for them, but\nthey did not answer. There were three men with heavy-duty blast-rifles.\nOne was the one Calhoun had burned out of his hiding-place. That man's\nrifle exploded when the flames hit it. Two remained. One--so Calhoun\npresently discovered--was working his way behind underbrush to a shelf\nfrom which he could shoot down at Calhoun. Calhoun had dropped into a\nhollow and pulled Maril to cover at the first shot. The second man\nhappily planned to get to a point where he could shoot him like a fish\nin a barrel. The third man had fired half a dozen times and then\ndisappeared. Calhoun estimated that he intended to get around to the\nrear, in hope there was no protection from that direction for Calhoun.\nIt would take some time for him to manage it.\n\nSo Calhoun industriously concentrated his fire on the man trying to get\nabove him. He was behind a boulder, not too dissimilar to Calhoun's\nbreastwork. Calhoun set fire to the brush at the point at which the\nother man aimed. That, then, made his effort useless. Then Calhoun sent\na dozen bolts at the other man's rocky shield. It heated up. Steam rose\nin a whitish mass and blew directly away from Calhoun. He saw that\nantagonist flee. He saw him so clearly that he was positive that there\nwas a patch of blue pigment on the right-hand side of the back of his\nneck.\n\nHe grunted and swung to find the third. That man moved through thick\nundergrowth, and Calhoun set it on fire in a neat pattern of spreading\nflames. Evidently, these men had had no training in battle-tactics with\nblast-rifles. The third man also had to get away. He did. But something\nfrom him arched through the smoke. It fell to the ground directly upwind\nfrom Calhoun. White smoke puffed up violently.\n\nIt was instinct that made Calhoun react as he did. He jerked the girl\nMaril to her feet and rushed her toward the Med Ship. Smoke from the\nflung bomb upwind barely swirled around him and missed Maril altogether.\nCalhoun, though, got a whiff of something strange, not scorched or\nburning vegetation at all. He ceased to breathe and plunged onward. In\nclear air he emptied his lungs and refilled them. They were then halfway\nto the ship, with Murgatroyd prancing on ahead.\n\nBut then Calhoun's heart began to pound furiously. His muscles twitched\nand tense. He felt extraordinary symptoms like an extreme of agitation.\nCalhoun was familiar enough with tear-gas, used by police on some\nplanets. But this was different and worse. Even as he helped and urged\nMaril onward, he automatically considered his sensations, and had it.\nPanic gas! Police did not use it because panic is worse than rioting.\nCalhoun felt all the physical symptoms of fear and of gibbering terror.\nA man whose mind yields to terror experiences certain physical\nsensations, wildly beating heart, tensed and twitching muscles, and a\nfrantic impulse to convulsive action. A man in whom those physical\nsensations are induced by other means will--ordinarily--find his mind\nyielding to terror.\n\nCalhoun couldn't combat his feelings, but his clinical attitude enabled\nhim to act despite them. The three from Weald reached the base of the\nMed Ship. One of their enemies had lost his rifle and need not be\ncounted. Another had fled from flames and might be ignored for some\nmoments, anyhow. But a blast-bolt struck the ship's metal hull only feet\nfrom Calhoun, and he whipped around to the other side and let loose a\nstaccato of fire which emptied the rifle of all its charges.\n\nThen he opened the airlock door, hating the fact that he shook and\ntrembled. He urged the girl and Murgatroyd in. He slammed the outer\nairlock door just as another blaster-bolt hit.\n\n\"They--they don't realize,\" said Maril desperately. \"If they only\nknew--.\"\n\n\"Talk to them, if you like,\" said Calhoun. His teeth chattered and he\nraged, because the symptom was of terror he denied.\n\nHe pushed a button on the control-board. He pointed to a microphone. He\ngot at an oxygen-bottle and inhaled deeply. Oxygen, obviously, should be\nan antidote for panic, since the symptoms of terror act to increase the\noxygenation of the blood-stream and muscles, and to make superhuman\nexertion possible if necessary. Breathing ninety-five per cent oxygen\nproduced the effect the terror-inspiring gas strove for, so his heart\nslowed nearly to normal and his body relaxed. He held out his hand and\nit did not tremble.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe turned to Maril. She hadn't spoken into the mike yet.\n\n\"They--may not be from Dara!\" she said shakily. \"I just thought! They\ncould be somebody else--maybe criminals who planned to raid the mine for\na shipload of its ore ...\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" said Calhoun. \"I saw one of them clearly enough to be sure.\nBut they're skeptical characters. I'm afraid there may be more on the\nway here wherever they keep themselves. Anyhow, now we know some of them\nare in hearing! I'll take advantage of that and we'll go on.\"\n\nHe took the microphone. Instants later his voice boomed in the stillness\noutside the ship, cutting through the thin shrill of invisible small\ncreatures.\n\n\"This is the Med Ship Aesclipus Twenty,\" said Calhoun's voice, amplified\nto a shout. \"I left Weald four days ago, one day after the cargo-ship\nfrom here arrived with everybody on board dead. On Weald they don't know\nhow it happened, but they suspect blueskins. Sooner or later they'll\nsearch here. Get away! Cover up your tracks! Hide all signs that you've\never been here! Get the hell away, fast! One more warning! There's talk\nof fusion-bombing Dara. They're scared! If they find your\ntraces, they'll be more scared still! So cover up your tracks\nand--get--away--from--here!\"\n\nThe many-times-multiplied voice rolled and echoed among the hills. But\nit was very clear. Where it could be heard it could be understood, and\nit could be heard for miles.\n\nBut there was no response to it. Calhoun waited a reasonable time. Then\nhe shrugged and seated himself at the control-board.\n\n\"It isn't easy,\" he observed, \"to persuade desperate men that they've\nout-smarted themselves! Hold hard, Murgatroyd!\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe rockets bellowed. Then there was a tremendous noise to end all\nnoises, and the ship began to climb. It sped up and up and up. By the\ntime it was out of atmosphere it had velocity enough to coast to clear\nspace and Calhoun cut the rockets altogether. He busied himself with\nthose astrogational chores which began with orienting oneself to\ngalactic directions after leaving a planet which rotates at its own\nindividual speed. Then one computes the overdrive course to another\nplanet, from the respective co\u00f6rdinates of the world one is leaving and\nthe one one aims for. Then,--in this case at any rate--there was the\nvery finicky task of picking out a fourth-magnitude star of whose\nplanets one was his destination. He aimed for it with ultra-fine\nprecision.\n\n\"Overdrive coming,\" he said presently. \"Hold on!\"\n\nSpace reeled. There was nausea and giddiness and a horrible sensation of\nfalling in a wildly unlikely spiral. Then stillness, and solidity, and\nthe blackness of the Pit outside the Med Ship. The little craft was in\noverdrive again.\n\nAfter a long while, the girl Maril said uneasily.\n\n\"I don't know what you plan now--.\"\n\n\"I'm going to Dara,\" said Calhoun. \"On Orede I tried to get the\nblueskins there to get going, fast. Maybe I succeeded. I don't know. But\nthis thing's been mishandled! Even if there's a famine, people shouldn't\ndo things out of desperation!\"\n\n\"I know now that I was--very foolish--.\"\n\n\"Forget it,\" commanded Calhoun. \"I wasn't talking about you. Here I run\ninto a situation that the Med Service should have caught and cleaned up\ngenerations ago! But it's not only a Med Service obligation, it's a\ncurrent mess! Before I could begin to get at the basic problem, those\nidiots on Orede--. It'd happened before I reached Weald! An emotional\nexplosion triggered by a ship full of dead men that nobody intended to\nkill.\"\n\nMaril shook her head.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Those Darian characters,\" said Calhoun annoyedly, \"shouldn't have gone\nto Orede in the first place. If they went there, they should at least\nhave stayed on a continent where there were no people from Weald digging\na mine and hunting cattle for sport on their off days! They could be\nspotted! I believe they were! And again, if it had been a long way from\nthe mine installation, they could probably have wiped out the people who\nsighted them before they could get back with the news! But it looks like\nminers saw men hunting, and got close enough to see they were blueskins,\nand then got back to the mine with the news!\"\n\nShe waited for him to explain.\n\n\"I know I'm guessing, but it fits!\" he said distastefully. \"So something\nhad to be done. Either the mining settlement had to be wiped out or the\nstory that blueskins were on Orede had to be discredited. The blueskins\ntried for both. They used panic-gas on a herd of cattle and it made them\ncrazy and they charged the settlement like the four-footed lunatics they\nare! And the blueskins used panic-gas on the settlement itself as the\ncattle went through. It should have settled the whole business nicely.\nAfter it was over every man in the settlement would believe he'd been\nout of his head for a while, and he'd have the crazy state of the\nsettlement to think about, and he wouldn't be sure of what he'd seen or\nheard beforehand. They might try to verify the blueskin story later, but\nthey wouldn't believe anything certainly! It should have worked!\"\n\nAgain she waited. So Calhoun said very wrily indeed;\n\n\"Unfortunately, when the miners panicked, they stampeded into the ship.\nAlso unfortunately, panic-gas got into the ship with them. So they\nstayed panicked while the astrogator--in panic!--took off and headed for\nWeald and threw on the overdrive--which would be set for Weald\nanyhow--because that would be the fastest way to run away from whatever\nhe imagined he feared. But he and all the men on the ship were still\ncrazy with panic from the gas they were re-breathing until they died!\"\n\nSilence. After a long interval, Maril asked;\n\n\"You don't think the--Darians intended to kill?\"\n\n\"I think they were stupid!\" said Calhoun angrily. \"Somebody's always\nurging the police to use panic-gas in case of public tumult. But it's\ntoo dangerous. Nobody knows what one man will do in a panic. Take a\nhundred or two or three and panic them all, and there's no limit to\ntheir craziness! The whole thing was handled wrong!\"\n\n\"But you don't blame them?\"\n\n\"For being stupid, yes,\" said Calhoun fretfully. \"But if I'd been in\ntheir place, perhaps ...\"\n\n\"Where were you born?\" asked Maril suddenly.\n\nCalhoun jerked his head around. He said;\n\n\"No! Not where you're guessing--or hoping. Not on Dara. Just because I\nact as if Darians were human doesn't mean I have to be one! I'm a Med\nService man, and I'm acting as I think I should.\" His tone became\nexasperated. \"Dammit, I'm supposed to deal with health situations,\nactual and possible causes of human deaths! And if Weald thinks it finds\nproof that blueskins are in space again and caused the death of\nWealdians it won't be healthy! They're halfway set anyhow to drop\nfusion-bombs on Dara to wipe it out!\"\n\nMaril said fiercely;\n\n\"They might as well drop bombs. It'll be quicker than starvation, at\nleast!\"\n\nCalhoun looked at her more exasperatedly than before.\n\n\"It is a crop failure again?\" he demanded. When she nodded he said\nbitterly; \"Famine conditions already?\" When she nodded again he said\ndrearily; \"And of course famine is the great-grandfather of health\nproblems! And that's right in my lap with all the rest!\"\n\nHe stood up. Then he sat down again.\n\n\"I'm tired!\" he said flatly. \"I'd like to get some sleep.\"\n\nMaril understood. She picked up a book and went into the other cabin.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAlone in the control compartment, he tried to relax, but it was not\npossible. He flung himself into a comfortable chair and considered the\nsituation of the people of the planet Dara. Those people were marked by\npatches of blue pigment as an inherited consequence of a plague of three\ngenerations past. Dara was a planet of pariahs, excluded from the human\nrace by those who had been conditioned to fear them.\n\nAnd now there was famine on Dara for the second time, and they were of\nno mind to starve quietly. There was food on the planet Orede, monstrous\nherds of cattle without owners. It was natural enough for Darians to\nbuild a ship or ships and try to bring food back to its starving people.\nBut that desperately necessary enterprise had now roused Weald to a\nfrenzy of apprehension. Weald was if possible more hysterically afraid\nof blueskins than ever before, and even more implacably the enemy of the\nstarving planet's population. Weald itself throve and prospered.\nIronically, it had such an excess of foodstuffs that it stored them in\nunneeded space-ships in orbits about itself. Hundreds of thousands of\ntons of grain circled Weald in sealed-tight hulks, while the people of\nDara starved and only dared try to steal--it could be called\nstealing--some of the innumerable wild cattle of Orede.\n\nThe blueskins on Orede could not trust Calhoun, so they pretended not to\nhear--or maybe they didn't hear. They'd been abandoned and betrayed by\nall of humanity beyond their world. They'd been threatened and oppressed\nby guardships in orbit about them, ready to shoot down any space-craft\nthey might send aloft.\n\nSo Calhoun pondered ...\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA long time later Calhoun heard small sounds which were not normal on a\nMed Ship in overdrive. They were not part of the random noises carefully\ngenerated to keep the silence of the ship endurable. Calhoun raised his\nhead. He listened sharply. No sound could come from outside.\n\nHe knocked on the door of the sleeping-cabin. The noises stopped\ninstantly.\n\n\"Come out,\" he commanded through the door.\n\n\"I'm--I'm all right,\" said Maril's voice. But it was not quite steady.\nShe paused. \"I was just having a bad dream.\"\n\n\"I wish,\" said Calhoun, \"that you'd tell me the truth occasionally! Come\nout, please!\"\n\nThere were stirrings. After a little the door opened and Maril appeared.\nShe looked as if she'd been crying. She said quickly;\n\n\"I probably look queer, but it's because I was asleep.\"\n\n\"To the contrary,\" said Calhoun, fuming, \"you've been lying awake\ncrying. I don't know why. I've been out here wishing I could sleep,\nbecause I'm frustrated. But since you aren't asleep maybe you can help\nme with my job. I've figured some things out. For some others I need\nfacts. How about it?\"\n\nShe swallowed.\n\n\"I'll try.\"\n\n\"Coffee?\" he asked.\n\nMurgatroyd popped his head out of his miniature sleeping-cabin.\n\n\"_Chee?_\" he asked interestedly.\n\n\"Go back to sleep!\" snapped Calhoun.\n\nHe began to pace back and forth.\n\n\"I need to know something about the pigment patches,\" he said jerkily.\n\"Maybe it sounds crazy to think of such things now. First things first,\nyou know. But that is a first thing! So long as Darians don't look like\nthe people of other worlds, they'll be considered different. If they\nlook repulsive, they'll be thought of as evil.... Tell me about those\npatches. They're different-sized and different-shaped and they appear in\ndifferent places. You've none on your face or hands, anyhow.\"\n\n\"I haven't any at all,\" said the girl reservedly.\n\n\"I thought--\"\n\n\"Not everybody,\" she said defensively. \"Nearly, yes. But not all. Some\npeople don't have them. Some people are born with bluish splotches on\ntheir skin, but they fade out while they're children. When they grow up\nthey're just like--the people of Weald or any other world. And their\nchildren never have them.\"\n\nCalhoun stared.\n\n\"You couldn't possibly be proved to be a Darian, then?\"\n\nShe shook her head. Calhoun remembered, and started the coffee-maker.\n\n\"When you left Dara,\" he said, \"You were carried a long, long way, to\nsome planet where they'd practically never heard of Dara, and where the\nname meant nothing. You could have settled there, or anywhere else and\nforgotten about Dara. But you didn't. Why not, since you're not a\nblueskin?\"\n\n\"But I am!\" she said fiercely. \"My parents, my brothers and sisters, and\nKorvan--.\"\n\nThen she bit her lip. Calhoun took note but did not comment on the name\nthat she had mentioned.\n\n\"Then your parents had the splotches fade, so you never had them,\" he\nsaid absorbedly. \"Something like that happened on Tralee, once! There's\na virus--a whole group of virus particles! Normally we humans are immune\nto them. One has to be in terrifically bad physical condition for them\nto take hold and produce whatever effects they do. But once they're\nestablished they're passed on from mother to child.... And when they die\nout it's during childhood, too!\"\n\nHe poured coffee for the two of them. As usual, Murgatroyd swung down to\nthe floor and said impatiently;\n\n\"_Chee! Chee! Chee!_\"\n\nCalhoun absently filled Murgatroyd's tiny cup and handed it to him.\n\n\"But this is marvellous!\" he said exuberantly. \"The blue patches\nappeared after the plague, didn't they? After people recovered--when\nthey recovered?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMaril stared at him. His mind was filled with strictly professional\nconsiderations. He was not talking to her as a person. She was purely a\nsource of information.\n\n\"So I'm told,\" said Maril reservedly. \"Are there any more humiliating\nquestions you want to ask?\"\n\nHe gaped at her. Then he said ruefully;\n\n\"I'm stupid, Maril, but you're touchy. There's nothing personal.\"\n\n\"There is to me!\" she said fiercely. \"I was born among blueskins, and\nthey're of my blood, and they're hated and I'd have been killed on Weald\nif I'd been known as--what I am! And there's Korvan, who arranged for me\nto be sent away as a spy and advised me to do just what you\nsaid,--abandon my home world and everybody I care about! Including him!\nIt's personal to me!\"\n\nCalhoun wrinkled his forehead helplessly.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" he repeated, \"Drink your coffee!\"\n\n\"I don't want it,\" she said bitterly. \"I'd like to die!\"\n\n\"If you stay around where I am,\" Calhoun told her, \"you may get your\nwish. All right. There'll be no more questions, I promise.\"\n\nShe turned and moved toward the door to the sleeping-cabin. Calhoun\nlooked after her.\n\n\"Maril,\" he called out to her.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Why were you crying?\"\n\n\"You wouldn't understand,\" she said evenly.\n\nCalhoun shrugged his shoulders almost up to his ears. He was a\nprofessional man. In his profession he was not incompetent. But there is\nno profession in which a really competent man tries to understand women.\nCalhoun annoyedly had to let fate or chance or disaster take care of\nMaril's personal problems. He had larger matters to cope with.\n\nBut he had something to work on, now. He hunted busily in the reference\ntapes. He came up with an explicit collection of information on exactly\nthe subject he needed. He left the control-room to go down into the\nstorage areas of the Med Ship's hull. He found an ultra-frigid storage\nbox, whose contents were kept at the temperature of liquid air. He\ndonned thick gloves, used a special set of tongs, and extracted a tiny\nblock of plastic in which a sealed-tight phial of glass was embedded. It\nfrosted instantly he took it out, and when the storage-box was closed\nagain the block was covered with a thick and opaque coating of frozen\nmoisture.\n\nHe went back to the control-room and pulled down the panel which made\navailable a small-scale but surprisingly adequate biological laboratory.\nHe set the plastic block in a container which would raise it very, very\ngradually to a specific temperature and hold it there. It was,\nobviously, a living culture from which any imaginable quantity of the\nsame culture could be bred. Calhoun set the apparatus with great\nexactitude.\n\n\"This,\" he told Murgatroyd, \"may be a good day's work. Now I think I can\nrest.\"\n\nThen, for a long while, there was no sound or movement in the Med Ship.\nThe girl Maril may have slept, or maybe not. Calhoun lay relaxed in a\nchair which at the touch of a button became the most comfortable of\nsleeping-places. Murgatroyd remained in his cubbyhole, his tail curled\nover his nose. There were comforting, unheard, easily dismissable\nmurmurings now and again. They kept the feeling of life alive in the\nship. But for such infinitesimal stirrings of sound--carefully recorded\nfor this exact purpose--the feel of the ship would have been that of a\ntomb.\n\nBut it was quite otherwise when another ship-day began with the taped\nsounds of morning activities as faint as echoes but nevertheless\nestablishing an atmosphere of their own.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCalhoun examined the plastic block and its contents. He read the\ninstruments which had cared for it while he slept. He put the block--no\nlonger frosted--in the culture-microscope and saw its enclosed,\ninfinitesimal particles of life in the process of multiplying on the\nfood that had been frozen with them when they were reduced to the spore\ncondition. He beamed. He replaced the block in the incubation oven and\nfaced the day cheerfully.\n\nMaril greeted him with great reserve. They breakfasted.\n\n\"I've been thinking,\" said Maril evenly. \"I think I can get you a\nhearing for--whatever ideas you may have to help Dara.\"\n\n\"Kind of you,\" murmured Calhoun. \"May I ask whose influence you'll\nexert?\"\n\n\"There's a man,\" said Maril reservedly, \"who--thinks a great deal of me.\nI don't know his present official position, but he was certain to become\nprominent. I'll tell him how you've acted up to now, and your attitude,\nand of course that you're Med Service. He'll be glad to help you, I'm\nsure.\"\n\n\"Splendid!\" said Calhoun, nodding. \"That will be Korvan.\"\n\nShe started.\n\n\"How did you know?\"\n\n\"Intuition,\" said Calhoun drily. \"All right. I'll count on him.\"\n\nBut he did not. He worked in the tiny biological lab all that ship-day\nand all the next. The girl remained quiet.\n\nOn the ship-day after, the time for breakfast approached. And while the\nship was practically a world all by itself, it was easy to look forward\nwith confidence to the future. But when contact and--in a\nfashion--conflict with other and larger worlds loomed nearer, prospects\nseemed less bright. Calhoun had definite plans, now, but there were so\nmany ways in which they could be frustrated! Weald's political leaders\ncould not oppose hysterical demands for action against blueskins, after\na deathship arrived with no signs whatever of blueskins as responsible\nfor its cargo of corpses. It was certain that a starving Dara would tend\nto desperate and fatal measures against hereditary enemies.\n\nCalhoun sat down at the control-board and watched the clock.\n\n\"I've got things lined up,\" he told Maril wrily, \"if only they work out.\n_If_ I can make somebody on Dara listen and follow my advice and _if_\nWeald doesn't get ideas and isn't doing what I suspect it is, maybe\nsomething can be done.\"\n\n\"I'm sure you'll do your best,\" said Maril politely.\n\nCalhoun managed to grin. He watched the ship-clock. There was no\nsensation attached to overdrive travel except at the beginning and the\nend. It was now time for the end. He might find that absolutely anything\nhad happened while he made plans which would immediately be seen to be\nhopeless. Weald could have sent ships to Dara, or Dara might be in such\na state of desperation that ...\n\nAs it turned out, Dara was desperate. The Med Ship came out nearly a\nlight-month from the sun about which the planet Dara revolved. Calhoun\nwent into a short hop toward it. Then Dara was on the other side of the\nblazing yellow star. It took time to reach it. He called down,\nidentifying himself and the ship and asking for co\u00f6rdinates so his ship\ncould be brought to ground. There was confusion, as if the request were\nso unusual that the answers were not ready. The grid, too, was on the\nplanet's night side. Presently the ship was locked onto by the grid's\nforce-fields. It went downward without incident.\n\nCalhoun saw that Maril sat tensely, twisting her fingers within each\nother, until the ship actually touched ground.\n\nThen he opened the exit-port, and faced armed men in the darkness, with\nblast-rifles trained on him. There was a portable cannon trained on the\nMed Ship itself.\n\n\"Come out!\" rasped a voice. \"If you try anything you get blasted! Your\nship and its contents are seized by the planetary government!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5\n\n\nIt seemed that the smell of hunger was in the air. The armed men were\ncadaverous. Lights came on, and stark, harsh shadows lay black upon the\nground. Calhoun's captors were uniformed, but the uniforms hung loosely\nupon them. Where the lights struck upon their faces, their cheeks were\nhollow. They were emaciated. And there were the splotches of pigment of\nwhich Calhoun had heard. The leader of the truculent group was blue,\nexcept for two fingers which in the glaring illumination seemed whiter\nthan white.\n\n\"Out!\" said that man savagely. \"We're taking over your stock of food.\nYou'll get your share of it, like everybody else, but--out!\"\n\nMaril spoke over Calhoun's shoulder. She uttered a cryptic sentence or\ntwo. It should have amounted to identification, but there was skepticism\nin the the armed party.\n\n\"Oh, you're one of us, eh?\" said the guard-leader sardonically. \"You'll\nhave a chance to prove that! Come out of there!\"\n\nCalhoun spoke abruptly;\n\n\"This is a Med Ship,\" he said. \"There are medicines and bacterial\ncultures, inside it. They shouldn't be meddled with. Here on Dara you've\nhad enough of plagues!\"\n\nThe man with the blue hand said as sardonically as before;\n\n\"I said the government was taking over your ship! It won't be looted.\nBut you're not taking a full cargo of food away! In fact, it's not\nlikely you're leaving!\"\n\n\"I want to speak to someone in authority,\" snapped Calhoun. \"We've just\ncome from Weald.\" He felt bristling hatred all about him as he named\nWeald. \"There's tumult there. They're talking about dropping fusion\nbombs here. It's important that I talk to somebody with the authority to\ntake a few sensible precautions!\"\n\nHe descended to the ground. There was a panicky \"_Chee! Chee!_\" from\nbehind him, and Murgatroyd came dashing to swarm up his body and cling\napprehensively to his neck.\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"A _tormal,_\" said Calhoun. \"He's not a pet. Your medical men will know\nsomething about him. This is a Med Ship and I'm a Med Ship man, and he's\nan important member of the crew. He's a Med Ship _tormal_ and he stays\nwith me!\"\n\nThe man with the blue hand said harshly;\n\n\"There's somebody waiting to ask you questions. Here!\"\n\nA ground-car came rolling out from the side of the landing-grid\nenclosure. The ground-car ran on wheels, and wheels were not much used\non modern worlds. Dara was behind the times in more ways than one.\n\n\"This car will take you to Defense and you can tell them anything you\nwant. But don't try to sneak back in this ship! It'll be guarded!\"\n\nThe ground-car was enclosed, with room for a driver and the three from\nthe Med Ship. But armed men festooned themselves about its exterior and\nit went bumping and rolling to the massive ground-layer girders of the\ngrid. It rolled out under them and there was paved highway. It picked up\nspeed.\n\nThere were buildings on either side of the road, but few showed lights.\nThis was night-time, and the men at the landing-grid had set a pattern\nof hunger, so that the silence and the dark buildings did not seem a\nsign of tranquility and sleep, but of exhaustion and despair. The\nhighway lamps were few, by comparison with other inhabited worlds, and\nthe ground-car needed lights of its own to guide its driver over a paved\nsurface that needed repair. By those moving lights other depressing\nthings could be seen. Untidiness. Buildings not kept up to perfection.\nEvidences of apathy. The road hadn't been cleaned lately. There was\nlitter here and there.\n\nEven the fact that there were no stars added to the feeling of\nwretchedness and gloom and--ultimately--of hunger.\n\nMaril spoke nervously to the driver.\n\n\"The famine isn't any better?\"\n\nHe moved his head in negation, but did not speak.\n\n\"I left--two years ago,\" said Maril. \"It was just beginning then.\nRationing hadn't started then--.\"\n\nThe driver said evenly;\n\n\"There's rationing now!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe car went on and on. A vast open space appeared ahead. Lights about\nits perimeter seemed few and pale.\n\n\"E-everything seems--worse. Even the lights.\"\n\n\"Using all the power,\" said the driver, \"to warm up ground to grow crops\nwhere it ought to be winter. Not doing too well, either.\"\n\nCalhoun knew, somehow, that Maril moistened her lips.\n\n\"I--was sent,\" she explained to the driver, \"to go ashore on Trent and\nthen make my way to Weald. I--mailed reports of what I found out back to\nTrent. Somebody got them back to here whenever--it was possible.\"\n\nThe driver said;\n\n\"Everybody knows the man on Trent disappeared. Maybe he got caught,\nmaybe somebody saw him without makeup. Or maybe he just quit being one\nof us. What's the difference? No use!\"\n\nCalhoun found himself wincing a little. The driver was not angry. He was\nhopeless. But men should not despair. They shouldn't accept hostility\nfrom those about them as a device of fate for their destruction. They\nshouldn't ...\n\nMaril said quickly to him;\n\n\"You understand? Dara's a heavy-metals planet. There aren't many light\nelements in our soil. Potassium is scarce. So our ground isn't very\nfertile. Before the Plague we traded heavy metals and manufactures for\nimports of food and potash. But since the Plague we've had no off-planet\ncommerce. We've been--quarantined.\"\n\n\"I gathered as much,\" said Calhoun. \"It was up to Med Service to see\nthat that didn't happen. It's up to Med Service now to see that it\nstops.\"\n\n\"Too late now for anything,\" said the driver, \"whatever Med Service may\nbe! They're talking about cutting down our population so there'll be\nfood enough for some to live. There are two questions about it: who's to\nbe kept alive and why.\"\n\nThe ground-car aimed now for a cluster of faintly brighter lights on the\nfar side of the great open space. They enlarged as they grew nearer.\nMaril said hesitantly;\n\n\"There was someone--Korvan--\" Calhoun didn't catch the rest of the name,\nMaril said hesitantly; \"He was working on food-plants. I--thought he\nmight accomplish something ...\"\n\nThe driver said caustically;\n\n\"Sure! Everybody's heard about him! He came up with a wonderful thing!\nHe and his outfit worked out a way to process weeds so they can be\neaten. And they can. You can fill your belly and not feel hungry, but\nit's like eating hay. You starve just the same. He's still working. Head\nof a government division.\"\n\nThe ground-car passed through a gate. It stopped before a lighted door.\nThe armed men hanging to its outside dropped off. They watched Calhoun\nclosely as he stepped out with Murgatroyd riding on his shoulder.\n\nMinutes later they faced a hastily-summoned group of officials of the\nDarian government. For a ship to land on Dara was so remarkable an event\nthat it called practically for a cabinet meeting. And Calhoun noted that\nthey were no better fed than the guards at the space-port.\n\nThey regarded Calhoun and Maril with oddly burning eyes. It was, of\ncourse, because the two of them showed no signs of hunger. They\nobviously had not been on short rations.\n\n\"My name is Calhoun,\" said Calhoun briskly. \"I've the usual Med Service\ncredentials. Now ...\"\n\nHe did not wait to be questioned. He told them of the appalling state of\nthings in the Twelfth Sector of the Med Service, so that men had been\nborrowed from other sectors to remedy the intolerable, and he was one of\nthem. He told of his arrival at Weald and what had happened there, from\nthe excessively cautious insistence that he prove he was not a Darian,\nto the arrival of the death-ship from Orede. He was giving them the news\naffecting them, as they had not heard it before.\n\nHe went on to tell of his stop at Orede and his purpose, and his\nencounter with the men he found there. When he finished there was\nsilence. He broke it.\n\n\"Now,\" he said, \"Maril's an agent of yours. She can add to what I've\ntold you. I'm Med Service. I have a job to do here to repair what wasn't\ndone before. I should make a planetary health inspection and make\nrecommendations for the improvement of the state of things. I'll be glad\nif you'll arrange for me to talk to your health officials. Things look\nbad, and something should be done.\"\n\nSomeone laughed without mirth.\n\n\"What will you recommend for long-continued undernourishment?\" he asked\nderisively. \"That's our health problem!\"\n\n\"I recommend food,\" said Calhoun.\n\n\"Where'll you fill the prescription?\"\n\n\"I've the answer to that, too,\" said Calhoun curtly. \"I'll want to talk\nto any space-pilots you've got. Get your astrogators together and I\nthink they'll approve my idea.\"\n\nThe silence was totally skeptical.\n\n\"Orede ...\"\n\n\"Not Orede,\" said Calhoun. \"Weald will be hunting that planet over for\nDarians. If they find any, they'll drop bombs here.\"\n\n\"Our only space-pilots,\" said a tall man, presently, \"are on Orede now.\nIf you've told the truth, they'll probably head back because of your\nwarning. They should bring meat.\"\n\nHis mouth worked peculiarly, and Calhoun knew that it was at the thought\nof food.\n\n\"Which,\" said another man sharply, \"goes to the hospitals! I haven't\ntasted meat in two years!\"\n\n\"Nobody has,\" growled another man still. \"But here's this man Calhoun.\nI'm not convinced he can work magic, but we can find out if he lies. Put\na guard on his ship. Otherwise let our health men give him his head.\nThey'll find out if he's from this Medical Service he tells of! And this\nMaril--\"\n\n\"I--can be identified,\" said Maril. \"I was sent to gather information\nand sent it in secret writing to one of us on Trent. I have a family\nhere. They'll know me! And I--there was someone who was working on\nfoods, and I believe he--made it possible to use--all sorts of\nvegetation for food. He will identify me.\"\n\nSomeone laughed harshly.\n\n\"Oh, yes!\" said a man with a blue forehead. \"He's a valuable man! Within\nthe year he's come up with a way to make his weeds taste like any food\none chooses. If we decide to cut our population, we'll simply give the\npeople to be eliminated all they want to eat of his products. They'll\nnot be hungry. They'll be quite happy. But they'll die for lack of\nnourishment. He's volunteered to prove it painless by going through it\nhimself!\"\n\nMaril swallowed.\n\n\"I'd like to see him,\" she repeated. \"And my family.\"\n\nSome of the blue-splotched men turned away. A broad-shouldered man said\nbluntly;\n\n\"Don't look for them to be glad to see you. And you'd better not show\nyourself in public. You've been well fed. You'll be hated for that.\"\n\nMaril began to cry. Murgatroyd said bewilderedly;\n\n\"_Chee! Chee!_\"\n\nCalhoun held him close. There was confusion. And Calhoun found the\nMinister of Health at hand--he looked most harried of all the officials\ngathered to question Calhoun--and proposed that he get a look at the\nhospital situation right away.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt wasn't practical. With all the population on half rations or less,\nwhen night came people needed to sleep. Most people, indeed, slept as\nmany hours out of the traditional twenty-four as they could manage. It\nwas much more pleasant to sleep than to be awake and constantly nagged\nat by continued hunger. And there was the matter of simple decency.\nContinuous gnawing hunger had an embittering effect upon everyone.\nQuarrelsomeness was a common experience. And people who would normally\nbe the leaders of opinion felt shame because they were obsessed by\nthoughts of food. It was best when people slept.\n\nStill, Calhoun was in the hospitals by daybreak. What he found moved him\nto savage anger. There were too many sick children. In every case\nundernourishment contributed to their sickness. And there was not enough\nfood to make them well. Doctors and nurses denied themselves food to\nspare it for their patients.\n\nCalhoun brought out hormones and enzymes and medicaments from the Med\nShip while the guard in the ship looked on. He demonstrated the\nprocesses of synthesis and autocatalysis that enabled such small samples\nto be multiplied indefinitely. He was annoyed by a clamorous appetite.\nThere were some doctors who ignored the irony of medical techniques\nbeing taught to cure non-nutritional disease, when everybody was\nhalf-fed, or less. They approved of Calhoun. They even approved of\nMurgatroyd when Calhoun explained his function.\n\nHe was, of course, a Med Service _tormal_, and _tormals_ were creatures\nof talent. They'd originally been found on a planet in the Deneb area,\nand they were engaging and friendly small animals, but the remarkable\nfact about them was that they couldn't contract any disease. Not any.\nThey had a built-in, explosive reaction to bacterial and viral toxins,\nand there hadn't yet been any pathogenic organism discovered to which a\n_tormal_ could not more or less immediately develop antibody-resistance.\nSo that in interstellar medicine _tormals_ were priceless. Let\nMurgatroyd be infected with however localized, however specialized an\ninimical organism, and presently some highly valuable defensive\nsubstance could be isolated from his blood and he'd remain in his usual\nexuberant good health. When the antibody was analyzed by those\ntechniques of microanalysis the Service had developed,--why--that was\nthat. The antibody could be synthesized and one could attack any\nepidemic with confidence.\n\nThe tragedy for Dara was, of course, that no Med Ship had come there,\nthree generations ago, when the Dara plague raged. Worse, after the\nplague Weald was able to exert pressure which only a criminally\nincompetent Med Service director would have permitted. But criminal\nincompetence and its consequences was what Calhoun had been loaned to\nSector Twelve to help remedy.\n\nHe was not at ease, though. No ship arrived from Orede to bear out his\naccount of an attempt to get that lonely world evacuated before Weald\ndiscovered it had blueskins on it. Maril had vanished, to visit or\nreturn to her family, or perhaps to consult with the mysterious Korvan\nwho'd arranged for her to leave Dara to be a spy, and had advised her\nsimply to make a new life somewhere else, abandoning a famine-ridden,\ndespised, and outcast world. Calhoun had learned of two achievements\nthe same Korvan had made for his world. Neither was remarkably\nconstructive. He'd offered to prove the value of the second by dying of\nit. Which might make him a very admirable character, or he could have a\npassion for martyrdom,--which is much more common than most people\nthink. In two days Calhoun was irritable enough from unaccustomed hunger\nto suspect the worst of him.\n\nAnd there was Weald to worry about. Weald was hysterically resolved to\nend what it considered the blueskin menace for once and for all. There\nwere parallels to such unreasoning frenzy even in the ancient history of\nEarth. A word still remained in the dictionaries referring to it.\nGenocide.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMeanwhile Calhoun worked doggedly; in the hospitals while the patients\nwere awake and in the Med Ship--under guard--afterward. He had hunger\ncramps now, but he tested a plastic cube with a thriving biological\nculture in it. He worked at increasing his store of it. He'd snipped\nsamples of pigmented skin from dead patients in the hospitals, and\nexamined the pigmented areas, and very, very painstakingly verified a\ntheory. It took an electron microscope to do it, but he found a virus in\nthe blue patches which matched the type discovered on Tralee. The Tralee\nviruses had effects which were passed on from mother to child, and\nheredity had been charged with the observed results of quasi-living\nviral particles. And then Calhoun very, very carefully introduced into a\nvirus culture the material he had been growing in a plastic cube. He\nwatched what happened.\n\nHe was satisfied, so much so that immediately afterward he barely\nmanaged to stagger off to bed.\n\nThat night the ship from Orede came in, packed with frozen bloody\ncarcasses of cattle. Calhoun knew nothing of it. But next morning Maril\ncame back. There were shadows under her eyes and her expression was of\nsomeone who has lost everything that had meaning in her life.\n\n\"I'm all right,\" she insisted, when Calhoun commented. \"I've been\nvisiting my family. I've seen--Korvan. I'm quite all right.\"\n\n\"You haven't eaten any better than I have,\" Calhoun observed.\n\n\"I--couldn't!\" admitted Maril. \"My sisters--my little sisters--so\nthin.... There's rationing for everybody and it's all efficiently\narranged. They even had rations for me. But I couldn't eat! I--gave most\nof my food to my sisters and they--squabbled over it!\"\n\nCalhoun said nothing. There was nothing to say. Then she said in a no\nless desolate tone;\n\n\"Korvan said I was foolish to come back.\"\n\n\"He could be right,\" said Calhoun.\n\n\"But I had to!\" protested Maril. \"Because I--I've been eating all I\nwanted to, on Weald and in the ship, and I'm ashamed because they're\nhalf-starved and I'm not. And when you see what hunger does to them ...\nIt's terrible to be half-starved and not able to think of anything but\nfood!\"\n\n\"I hope,\" said Calhoun, \"to do something about that. If I can get hold\nof an astrogator or two.\"\n\n\"The--ship that was on Orede came in during the night,\" Maril told him\nshakily. \"It was loaded with frozen meat, but one ship-load's not enough\nto make a difference on a whole planet! And if Weald hunts for us on\nOrede, we daren't go back for more meat.\"\n\nShe said abruptly;\n\n\"There are some prisoners. They were miners. They were crowded out of\nthe ship. The Darians who'd stampeded the cattle took them prisoners.\nThey had to!\"\n\n\"True,\" said Calhoun. \"It wouldn't have been wise to leave Wealdians\naround on Orede with their throats cut. Or living, either, to tell about\na rumor of blueskins. Even if their throats will be cut now. Is that the\nprogram?\"\n\nMaril shivered.\n\n\"No ... They'll be put on short rations like everybody else. And people\nwill watch them. The Wealdians expect to die of plague any minute\nbecause they've been with Darians. So people look at them and laugh.\nBut it's not funny.\"\n\n\"It's natural,\" said Calhoun, \"but perhaps lacking in charity. Look\nhere! How about those astrogators? I need them for a job I have in\nmind.\"\n\nMaril wrung her hands.\n\n\"C--come here,\" she said in a low tone.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was an armed guard in the control-room of the ship. He'd watched\nCalhoun a good part of the previous day as Calhoun performed his\nmysterious work. He'd been off-duty and now was on duty again. He was\nbored. So long as Calhoun did not touch the control-board, though, he\nwas uninterested. He didn't even turn his head when Maril led the way\ninto the other cabin and slid the door shut.\n\n\"The astrogators are coming,\" she said swiftly. \"They'll bring some\nboxes with them. They'll ask you to instruct them so they can handle our\nship better. They lost themselves coming back from Orede, no, they\ndidn't lose themselves, but they lost time--enough time almost to make\nan extra trip for meat. They need to be experts. I'm to come along, so\nthey can be sure that what you teach them is what you've been doing\nright along.\"\n\nCalhoun said;\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"They're crazy!\" said Maril vehemently. \"They knew Weald would do\nsomething monstrous sooner or later. But they're going to try to stop it\nby more monstrousness sooner! Not everybody agrees, but there are\nenough. So they want to use your ship--it's faster in overdrive and so\non. And they'll go to Weald--in this ship--and--they say they'll give\nWeald something to keep it busy without bothering us!\"\n\nCalhoun said drily;\n\n\"This pays me off for being too sympathetic with blueskins! But if I'd\nbeen hungry for a couple of years, and was despised to boot by the\npeople who kept me hungry, I suppose I might react the same way. No,\" he\nsaid curtly as she opened her lips to speak again. \"Don't tell me the\ntrick. Considering everything, there's only one trick it could be. But I\ndoubt profoundly that it would work. All right.\"\n\nHe slid the door back and returned to the control-room. Maril followed\nhim. He said detachedly;\n\n\"I've been working on a problem outside of the food one. It isn't the\ntime to talk about it right now, but I think I've solved it.\"\n\nMaril turned her head, listening. There were footsteps on the tarmac\noutside the ship. Both doors of the airlock were open. Four men came in.\nThey were young men who did not look quite as hungry as most Darians,\nbut there was a reason for that. Their leader introduced himself and the\nothers. They were the astrogators of the ship Dara had built to try to\nbring food from Orede. They were not good enough, said their\nself-appointed leader. They overshot their destination. They came out of\noverdrive too far off line. They needed instructions.\n\nCalhoun nodded, and observed that he'd been asking for them.\n\n\"We've got orders,\" said their leader, steadily, \"to come on board and\nlearn from you how to handle this ship. It's better than the one we've\ngot.\"\n\n\"I asked for you,\" repeated Calhoun. \"I've an idea I'll explain as we go\nalong. Those boxes?\"\n\nSomeone was passing in iron boxes through the airlock. One of the four\nvery carefully brought them inside.\n\n\"They're rations,\" said a second young man. \"We don't go anywhere\nwithout rations--except Orede.\"\n\n\"Orede, yes. I think we were shooting at each other there,\" said Calhoun\npleasantly. \"Weren't we?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the young man.\n\nHe was neither cordial nor antagonistic. He was impassive. Calhoun\nshrugged.\n\n\"Then we can take off immediately. Here's the communicator and there's\nthe button. You might call the grid and arrange for us to be lifted.\"\n\nThe young man seated himself at the control-board. Very professionally,\nhe went through the routine of preparing to lift by landing-grid, which\nroutine has not changed in two hundred years. He went briskly ahead\nuntil the order to lift. Then Calhoun stopped him.\n\n\"Hold it!\"\n\nHe pointed to the airlock. Both doors were open. The young man at the\ncontrol-board flushed vividly. One of the others closed and dogged the\ndoors.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe ship lifted. Calhoun watched with seeming negligence. But he found\noccasion for a dozen corrections of procedure. This was presumably a\ntraining voyage of his own suggestion. Therefore when the blueskin pilot\nwould have flung the Med Ship into undirected overdrive, Calhoun grew\nstern. He insisted on a destination. He suggested Weald. The young men\nglanced at each other and accepted the suggestion. He made the acting\npilot look up the intrinsic business of its sun and measure its apparent\nbrightness from just off Dara. He made him estimate the change in\nbrightness to be expected after so many hours in overdrive, if one broke\nout to measure.\n\nThe first blueskin student pilot ended a Calhoun-determined tour of duty\nwith rather more of respect for Calhoun than he'd had at the beginning.\nThe second was anxious to show up better than the first. Calhoun drilled\nhim in the use of brightness-charts, by which the changes in apparent\nbrightness of stars between overdrive hops could be correlated with\nangular changes to give a three-dimensional picture of the nearer\nheavens. It was a highly necessary art which had not been worked out on\nDara, and the prospective astrogators became absorbed in this and other\nfine points of space-piloting. They'd done enough, in a few trips to\nOrede, to realize that they needed to know more. Calhoun showed them.\n\nCalhoun did not try to make things easy for them. He was hungry and\neasily annoyed. It was sound training tactics to be severe, and to\nphrase all suggestions as commands. He put the four young men in command\nof the ship in turn, under his direction. He continued to use Weald as a\ndestination, but he set up problems in which the Med Ship came out of\noverdrive pointing in an unknown direction and with a precessory motion.\nHe made the third of his students identify Weald in the celestial globe\ncontaining hundreds of millions of stars, and get on course in overdrive\ntoward it. The fourth was suddenly required to compute the distance to\nWeald from such data as he could get from observation, without reference\nto any records.\n\nBy this time the first man was chafing to take a second turn. Calhoun\ngave each of them a second gruelling lesson. He gave them, in fact, a\nhighly condensed but very sound course in the art of travel in space.\nHis young students took command in four-hour watches, with at least one\nbreakout from overdrive in each watch. He built up enthusiasm in them.\nThey ignored the discomfort of being hungry, though there had been no\nreason for them to stint on food in Orede--in growing pride in what they\ncame to know.\n\nWhen Weald was a first-magnitude star, the four were not highly\nqualified astrogators, to be sure, but they were vastly better spacemen\nthan at the beginning. Inevitably, their attitude toward Calhoun was\nrespectful. He'd been irritable and right. To the young, the combination\nis impressive.\n\nMaril had served as passenger only. In theory she was to compare\nCalhoun's lessons with his practise when alone. But he did nothing on\nthis journey which--teaching considered--was different from the two\ninterstellar journeys Maril had made with him. She occupied the\nsleeping-cabin during two of the six watches of each ship-day. She\noperated the food-readier, which was almost completely emptied of its\noriginal store of food;--confiscated by the government of Dara. That\namount of food would make no difference to the planet, but it was wise\nfor everyone on Dara to be equally ill-fed.\n\nOn the sixth day out from Dara, the sun of Weald had a magnitude of\nminus five-tenths.[A] The electron telescope could detect its larger\nplanets, especially a gas-giant fifth-orbit world of high albedo.\nCalhoun had his four students estimate its distance again, pointing out\nthe difference that could be made in breakout position if the Med Ship\nwere mis-aimed by as much as one second of arc.\n\n  [A] Earth's sun, from Earth, is of magnitude roughly minus thirty-six.\n\n\"That does it,\" Calhoun announced cheerfully. \"That's the last order\nI'll give you. You're graduate pilots from here on! Relax and have some\ncoffee.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"And now,\" said Calhoun, \"I suppose you'll tell me the truth about those\nboxes you brought on board. You said they were rations, but they haven't\nbeen opened in six days. I have an idea what they mean, but you tell\nme.\"\n\nThe four looked uncomfortable. There was a long pause.\n\n\"They could be,\" said Calhoun detachedly, \"cultures to be dumped on\nWeald. Weald is making plans to wipe out Dara. So some fool has decided\nto get Weald too busy fighting a plague of its own to bother with you.\nIs that right?\"\n\nThe young men stirred uneasily. \"Well--l--l, sir,\" said one of them,\nunhappily, \"that's what we were ordered to do.\"\n\n\"I object,\" said Calhoun. \"It wouldn't work. I just left Weald a little\nwhile back, remember. They've been telling themselves that some day Dara\nwould try that. They've made preparations to fight any imaginable\ncontagion you could drop on them. Every so often somebody claims it's\nhappening. It wouldn't work.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"In fact,\" said Calhoun, \"I will not permit you to do anything of the\nkind.\"\n\nOne of the young men, staring at Calhoun, nodded suddenly. His eyes\nclosed. He jerked his head erect and looked bewildered. A second sank\nheavily into a chair. He said remotely, \"Thish sfunny!\" and abruptly\nwent to sleep. The third found his knees giving away. He paid elaborate\nattention to them, stiffening them. But they yielded like rubber and he\nwent slowly down to the floor. The fourth said thickly with difficulty,\nyet reproachfully;\n\n\"'Thought y'were our frien'!\"\n\nHe collapsed.\n\nCalhoun very soberly tied them hand and foot and laid them out\ncomfortably on the floor. Maril watched, white-faced, her hand to her\nthroat. \"What have you done to them? Are they dead?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Calhoun, \"just drugged. They'll wake up presently.\"\n\nMaril said in a tense and desperate whisper;\n\n\"You're--betraying us! You're going to take us to Weald.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Calhoun. \"We'll only orbit around it. First, though, I want\nto get rid of those damned packed-up cultures. They're dead, by the way.\nI killed them with supersonics a couple of days ago, while a fine\nargument was going on about distance-measurements by variable Cepheids\nof known period.\"\n\nHe put the four boxes carefully in the waste-disposal unit. He operated\nit. The boxes and their contents streamed out to space in the form of\nmetallic and other vapors. Calhoun sat at the control-desk.\n\n\"I'm a Med Service man,\" he said detachedly. \"I couldn't cooperate in\nthe spread of plague, anyhow, though a useful epidemic might be another\nmatter. But the important thing right now is not keeping Weald busy with\ntroubles to increase their hatred of Dara. It's getting some food for\nDara. And driblets won't help. What's needed is in thousands of\ntons,--or tens of thousands.\" Then he said; \"Overdrive coming,\nMurgatroyd! Hold fast!\"\n\nThe universe vanished. The customary unpleasant sensations accompanied\nthe change. Murgatroyd burped.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6\n\n\nA large part of the firmament was blotted out by the blindingly bright\nhalf-disk of Weald, as it shone in the sunshine. It had ice-caps at its\npoles, and there were seas, and the mottled look of land which had that\ncarefully maintained balance of woodland and cultivated areas which was\nso effective in climate control. The Med Ship floated free, and Calhoun\nfretfully monitored all the beacon frequencies known to man.\n\nThere was relative silence inside the ship. Maril watched Calhoun in a\nsort of despairing indecision. The four young blueskins still slept,\nstill bound hand and foot upon the control-room floor. Murgatroyd\nregarded them, and Maril, and Calhoun in turn, and his small and furry\nforehead wrinkled helplessly.\n\n\"They can't have landed what I'm looking for!\" protested Calhoun as his\nsearch had no result. \"They can't. It would be too sensible for them to\nhave done it!\"\n\nMurgatroyd said \"_Chee!_\" in a subdued voice.\n\n\"But where the devil did they put them?\" demanded Calhoun. \"A polar\norbit would be ridiculous! They--\" Then he grunted in disgust. \"Oh! Of\ncourse! Now, where's the landing-grid?\"\n\nHe worked busily for minutes, checking the position of the Wealdian\nlanding-grid--mapped in the Sector Directory--against the look of\ncontinents and seas on the half-disk so plainly visible outside. He\nfound what he wanted. He put on the ship's solar-system drive.\n\n\"I wish,\" he complained to Maril, \"I wish I could think straight the\nfirst time! And it's so obvious! If you want to put something out in\nspace, and not have it interfere with traffic, in what sort of orbit and\nat what distance will you put it?\"\n\nMaril did not answer.\n\n\"Obviously,\" said Calhoun, \"you'll put it as far as possible from the\nlanding-pattern of ships coming in to the space-port. You'll put it on\nthe opposite side of the planet. And you'll want it to stay out of the\nway, where anybody can know it is at any time of the day or night\nwithout having to calculate anything. So you'll put it out in orbit so\nit will revolve around Weald in exactly one day, neither more or less,\nand you'll put it above the equator. And then it will remain quite\nstationary above one spot on the planet, a hundred and eighty degrees\nlongitude away from the landing-grid and directly over the equator.\"\n\nHe scribbled for a moment.\n\n\"Which means forty-two thousand miles high, give or take a few hundred,\nand--here! And I was hunting for it in a close-in orbit!\"\n\nHe grumbled to himself. He waited while the solar-system drive pushed\nthe Med Ship a quarter of the way around the bright planet below. The\nsunset line vanished and the planet's disk became a complete circle.\nThen Calhoun listened to the monitor earphones again, and grunted once\nmore, and changed course, and presently made a noise indicating\nsatisfaction.\n\nAgain presently he abandoned instrument-control and peered directly out\nof a port, handling the solar-system drive with great care. Murgatroyd\nsaid depressedly;\n\n\"_Chee!_\"\n\n\"Stop worrying,\" commanded Calhoun. \"We haven't been challenged, and\nthere is a beacon transmitter at work, just to make sure that nobody\nbumps into what we're looking for. It's a great help, because we do want\nto bump,--gently.\"\n\nStars swung across the port out of which he looked. Something dark\nappeared,--and then straight lines and exact curvings. Even Maril,\ndespairing and bewildered as she was, caught sight of something vastly\nlarger than the Med Ship, floating in space. She stared. The Med Ship\nmaneuvered very cautiously. She saw another large object. A third. A\nfourth. There seemed to be dozens of them.\n\nThey were space-ships, huge by comparison with Aesclipus Twenty. They\nfloated as the Med Ship did. They did not drive. They were not in\nformation. They were not at even distances from each other. They did not\npoint in the same direction. They swung in emptiness like derelicts.\n\nCalhoun jockeyed his small ship with infinite care. Presently there came\nthe gentlest of impacts and then a clanking sound. The appearance out\nthe vision-port became stationary, but still unbelievable. The Med Ship\nwas grappled magnetically to a vast surface of welded metal.\n\nCalhoun relaxed. He opened a wall-panel and brought out a vacuum suit.\nHe began briskly to get it on.\n\n\"Things move smoothly,\" he commented. \"We weren't challenged. So it's\nextremely unlikely that we were spotted. Our friends on the floor ought\nto begin to come to shortly. And I'm going to find out now whether I'm a\nhero or in sure-enough trouble!\"\n\nMaril said drearily;\n\n\"I don't know what you've done, except--\"\n\nCalhoun blinked at her, in the act of hauling the vacuum suit over his\nshoulders.\n\n\"Isn't it self-evident?\" he demanded. \"I've been giving astrogation\nlessons to these characters. I certainly didn't do it to help them dump\ngerm-cultures on Weald! I brought them here! Don't you see the point?\nThese are space-ships. They're in orbit around Weald. They're not manned\nand they're not controlled. In fact, they're nothing but sky-riding\nstorage bins!\"\n\nHe seemed to consider the explanation complete. He wriggled his arms\ninto the sleeves and gloves of the suit. He slung the air-tanks over his\nshoulder and hooked them to the suit.\n\n\"I'll be back,\" he said. \"I hope with good news. I've reason to be\nhopeful, though, because these Wealdians are very practical men. They\nhave things all prepared and tidy. I suspect I'll find these ships with\nstores of air and fuel--maybe even food--so that if Weald should manage\nto make a deal for the stuff stored out here in them, they'd only have\nto bring out crews.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe lifted the space-helmet down from its rack and put it on. He tested\nit, reading the tank air-pressure, power-storage, and other data from\nthe lighted miniature instruments visible through pinholes above his\neye-level. He fastened a space-rope about himself, speaking through the\nhelmet's opened face-plate.\n\n\"If our friends should wake up before I get back,\" he added, \"please\nrestrain them. I'd hate to be marooned.\"\n\nHe went waddling into the airlock with the coil of space-rope over one\nvacuum-suited arm. The inner lock door closed behind him A little later\nMaril heard the outer lock open. Then soundlessness.\n\nMurgatroyd whimpered a little. Maril shivered. Calhoun had gone out of\nthe ship to nothingness. He'd said that what he was looking for--and\nwhat he'd found--was forty-two thousand miles from Weald. One could\nimagine falling forty-two thousand miles, where one couldn't imagine\nfalling a light-year. Calhoun was walking on the steel plates of a\ngigantic space-ship which floated among dozens of its fellows, all\nseeming derelicts and seemingly abandoned. He was able to walk on the\nnearest because of magnetic-soled shoes. He trusted his life to them and\nto a flimsy space-rope which trailed after him out the Med Ship's\nairlock.\n\nTime passed. A clock ticked in that hurried tempo of five ticks to the\nsecond which has been the habit of clocks since time immemorial. Very\nsmall and trivial noises came from the background tape, preventing utter\nsilence from hanging intolerably in the ship. They were traffic-sounds,\nrecorded on a world no one knew how many light-years distant, and nobody\nknew when. There were sounds as of voices, too faint to suggest words,\nbut imparting a feel of life and activity to a soundless ship.\n\nMaril found herself listening tensely for something else. One of the\nfour bound blueskins snored, and stirred, and slept again. Murgatroyd\ngazed about unhappily, and swung down to the control-room floor, and\nthen paused for lack of any place to go or thing to do. He sat down and\nbegan half-heartedly to lick his whiskers. Maril stirred.\n\nMurgatroyd looked at her hopefully.\n\n\"_Chee?_\" he asked shrilly.\n\nShe shook her head. It became a habit to act as if Murgatroyd were a\nhuman being.\n\n\"N-no,\" she said unsteadily. \"Not yet.\"\n\nMore time passed. An unbearably long time. Then there was the faintest\nof clankings. It repeated. Then, abruptly, there were noises in the\nairlock. They continued. They were fumbling noises.\n\nThe outer airlock door closed. The inner door opened. Dense white fog\ncame out of it. There was motion. Calhoun followed the fog out of the\nlock. He carried objects which had been weightless, but were suddenly\nheavy in the ship's gravity-field. There were two space-suits and a\ncurious assortment of parcels. He spread them out, flipped aside the\nface-plate, and said briskly;\n\n\"This stuff is cold! Turn a heater on it, will you Maril?\"\n\nHe began to work his way out of his vacuum-suit.\n\n\"Item,\" he said. \"The ships are fuelled _and_ provisioned. A practical\ntribe, the Wealdians! The ships are ready to take off as soon as they're\nwarmed up inside. A half-degree sun doesn't radiate heat enough to keep\na ship warm, when the rest of the cosmos is effectively near zero\nKelvin. Here, point the heaters like this.\"\n\nHe adjusted the radiant-heat dispensers. The fog disappeared where their\nbeams played. But the metal space-suits glistened and steamed,--and the\nsteam disappeared within inches. They were so completely and utterly\ncold that they condensed the air about them as a liquid, which\nre\u00ebvaporated to make fog, which warmed up and disappeared and was\nimmediately replaced.\n\n\"Item,\" said Calhoun again, getting his arms out of the vacuum-suit\nsleeves. \"The controls are pretty nearly standard. Our sleeping friends\nwill be able to astrogate them back to Dara without trouble, provided\nonly that nobody comes out here to bother us before they leave.\"\n\nHe shed the last of the space-suit, stepping out of its legs.\n\n\"And,\" he finished wrily, \"I brought back an emergency supply of\nship-provisions for everybody concerned, but find that I'm idiot enough\nto feel that they'll choke me if I eat them while Dara's still\nstarving.\"\n\nMaril said;\n\n\"But--there isn't any hope for Dara! No real hope!\"\n\nHe gaped at her.\n\n\"What do you think we're here for?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe set to work to restore his four recent students to consciousness. It\nwas not a difficult task. The dosage, mixed in the coffee he had given\nthem earlier, was a light one. Calhoun took the precaution of disarming\nthem first, but presently four hot-eyed young men glared at him.\n\n\"I'm calling,\" said Calhoun, holding a blaster negligently in his hand,\n\"I'm calling for volunteers. There's a famine on Dara. There've been\nunmanageable crop-surpluses on Weald. On Dara, the government grimly\nrations every ounce of food. On Weald, the government has been buying up\nsurplus grain to keep the price up. To save storage costs, it's loaded\nthe grain into out-of-date space-ships it once used to stand sentry\nover Dara to keep it out of space when there was another famine there.\nThose ships have been put out in orbit, where we're hooked on to one of\nthem. It's loaded with half a million bushels of grain. I've brought\nspace-suits from it, I've turned on the heaters in its interior, and\nI've set its overdrive unit for a hop to Dara. Now I'm calling for\nvolunteers to take half a million bushels of grain to where it's needed.\nDo I get any volunteers?\"\n\nHe got four. Not immediately, because they were ashamed that he'd made\nit impossible to carry out their original fanatic plan, and now offered\nsomething much better to make up for it. They raged. But half a million\nbushels of grain meant that people who must otherwise die might live.\n\nUltimately, truculently, first one and then another angrily agreed.\n\n\"Good!\" said Calhoun. \"Now, how many of you dare risk the trip alone?\nI've got one grain-ship warming up. There are plenty of others around\nus. Every one of you can take a ship and half a million bushels to Dara,\nif you have the nerve?\"\n\nThe atmosphere changed. Suddenly they clamored for the task he offered\nthem. They were still acutely uncomfortable. He'd bossed them and taught\nthem until they felt capable and glamorous and proud. Then he'd pinned\ntheir ears back. But if they returned to Dara with four enemy ships and\nunimaginable quantities of food with which to break the famine....\n\nThere was work to be done first, of course. Only one ship was so far\nwarming up. Three more had to be entered, in space-suits, and each had\nto have its interior warmed so breathable air could exist inside it, and\nat least part of the stored provisions had to be brought up to\nreasonable temperature for use on the journey. Then the overdrive unit\nhad to be inspected and set for the length of journey that a direct\noverdrive hop to Dara would mean, and Calhoun had to make sure again\nthat each of the four could identify Dara's sun under all circumstances\nand aim for it with the requisite high precision, both before going into\noverdrive and after breakout. When all that was accomplished, Calhoun\nmight reasonably hope that they'd arrive. But it wasn't a certainty.\n\nStill, presently his four students shook hands with him, with the fine\ntolerance of young men intending much greater achievements than their\nteacher. They wouldn't speak on communicator again, because their\nmessages might be picked up on Weald.\n\nOf course for this action to be successful, it had to be performed with\nthe stealth of sneak-thieves.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhat seemed a long time passed. Then one ship turned slowly upon some\nunseen axis. It wavered back and forth, seeking a point of aim. A second\ntwisted in its place. A third put on the barest trace of solar-system\ndrive to get clear of the rest. The fourth ...\n\nOne ship vanished. It had gone into overdrive, heading for Dara at many\ntimes the speed of light. Another. Two more.\n\nThat was all. The remainder of the fleet hung clumsily in emptiness. And\nCalhoun worriedly went over in his mind the lessons he'd given in such a\npathetically small number of days. If the four ships reached Dara, their\npilots would be heroes. Calhoun had presented them with that estate over\ntheir bitter objection. But they would glory in it, if they reached\nDara.\n\nMaril looked at him with very strange eyes.\n\n\"Now what?\" she asked.\n\n\"We hang around,\" said Calhoun, \"to see if anybody comes up from Weald\nto find out what's happened. It's always possible to pick up a sort of\nsignal when a ship goes into overdrive. Usually it doesn't mean a thing.\nNobody pays any attention. But if somebody comes out here--\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"It'll be regrettable,\" said Calhoun. He was suddenly very tired. \"It'll\nspoil any chance of our coming back and stealing some more food--like\ninterstellar mice. If they find out what we've done they'll expect us to\ntry it again. They might get set to fight. Or they might simply land the\nrest of these ships.\"\n\n\"If I'd realized what you were about,\" said Maril, \"I'd have joined in\nthe lessons. I could have piloted a ship.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't have wanted to,\" said Calhoun. He yawned. \"You wouldn't\nwant to be a heroine.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Korvan,\" said Calhoun. He yawned again. \"I've asked about him. He's\nbeen trying very desperately to deserve well of his fellow blueskins.\nAll he's accomplished is develop a way to starve painlessly. He wouldn't\nfeel comfortable with a girl who'd helped make starving unnecessary.\nHe'd admire you politely, but he'd never marry you. And you know it.\"\n\nShe shook her head, but it was not easy to tell whether she denied the\nreaction of Korvan--whom Calhoun had never met--or denied that he was\nmore important to her than anything else. The last was what Calhoun\nplainly implied.\n\n\"You don't seem to be trying to be a hero!\" she protested.\n\n\"I'd enjoy it,\" admitted Calhoun, \"but I have a job to do. It's got to\nbe done. It's much more important than being admired.\"\n\n\"You could take another ship back,\" she told him. \"It would be worth\nmore to Dara than the Med Ship is! And then everybody would realize that\nyou'd planned everything.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Calhoun. \"But you've no idea how much this ship matters to\nDara!\"\n\nHe seated himself at the controls. He slipped headphones over his ears.\nHe listened. Very, very carefully, he monitored all the wave-lengths and\nwave-forms he could discover in use on Weald. There was no mention of\nthe oddity of behavior of shiploads of surplus grain aloft. There was no\nmention of the ships at all. But there was plenty of mention of Dara,\nand blueskins, and of the vicious political fight now going on to see\nwhich political party could promise the most complete protection against\nblueskins.\n\nAfter a full hour of it, Calhoun flipped off his receptor and swung the\nMed Ship to an exact, painstakingly precise aim at the sun around which\nDara rolled. He said;\n\n\"Overdrive coming, Murgatroyd!\"\n\nMurgatroyd grabbed. The stars went out and the universe reeled and the\nMed Ship became a sort of cosmos all its own.\n\nCalhoun yawned again.\n\n\"Now there's nothing to be done for a day or two,\" he said wearily, \"and\nI'm beginning to understand why people sleep all they can, on Dara. It's\none way not to feel hungry.\"\n\nMaril said tensely;\n\n\"You're going back? After they took the ship from you?\"\n\n\"The job's not finished,\" he explained. \"Not even the famine's ended,\nand the famine's a second-order effect. If there were no such thing as a\nblueskin, there'd be no famine. Food could be traded for. We've got to\ndo something to make sure there are no more famines.\"\n\nShe looked at him oddly.\n\n\"It would be desirable,\" she said with irony. \"But you can't do it.\"\n\n\"Not today, no,\" he admitted. Then he said longingly, \"I'm about to\ncatch up on some sleep.\"\n\nMaril rose and went into the other cabin. He settled down into the chair\nand fell instantly asleep.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor very many ship-hours, then, there was no action or activity or\nhappening of any imaginable consequence in the Med Ship. Very, very far\naway, light-years distant and light years apart, four shiploads of grain\nhurtled toward the famine-stricken planet of blueskins. Each great ship\nhad a single semi-skilled blueskin for pilot and crew. Thousands of\nmillions of suns blazed with violence appropriate to their stellar types\nin a galaxy of which a very small proportion had been explored and\ncolonized by humanity. The human race was now to be counted in\nquadrillions on scores of hundreds of inhabited worlds, but the tiny Med\nShip seemed the least significant of all possible created things. It\ncould travel between star-systems and even star-clusters, but it was not\nyet capable of crossing the continent of suns on which the human race\narose. And between any two solar systems the journeying of the Med Ship\nconsumed much time. Which would be maddening for someone with no work to\ndo or no resources in himself, or herself.\n\nOn the second ship-day Calhoun labored painstakingly and somewhat\ndistastefully at the little biological laboratory. Maril watched him in\na sort of brooding silence. Murgatroyd slept much of the time, with his\nfurry tail wrapped meticulously across his nose.\n\nToward the end of the day Calhoun finished his task. He had a matter of\nsix or seven cubic centimeters of clear liquid as the conclusion of a\nlong process of culturing, and examination by microscope, and again\nculturing plus final filtration. He looked at a clock and calculated\ntime.\n\n\"Better wait until tomorrow,\" he observed, and put the bit of clear\nliquid in a temperature-controlled place of safe-keeping.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Maril. \"What's it for?\"\n\n\"It's part of a job I have on hand,\" said Calhoun. He considered. \"How\nabout some music?\"\n\nShe looked astonished. But he set up an instrument and fed microtape\ninto it and settled back to listen. Then there was music such as she had\nnever heard before. Again it was a device to counteract isolation and\nmonotonous between-planet voyages. To keep it from losing its\neffectiveness, Calhoun rationed himself on music, as on other things.\nCalhoun deliberately went for weeks between uses of his recordings, so\nthat music was an event to be looked forward to and cherished.\n\nWhen he tapered off the stirring symphonies of Kun Gee with\ntranquilizing, soothing melodies from the Rim School of composers, Maril\nregarded him with a very peculiar gaze indeed.\n\n\"I think I understand now,\" she said slowly, \"why you don't act like\nother people. Toward me, for example. The way you live gives you what\nother people have to try to get in crazy ways,--making their work feed\ntheir vanity, and justify pride, and make them feel significant. But you\ncan put your whole mind on your work.\"\n\nHe thought it over.\n\n\"Med Ship routine is designed to keep one healthy in his mind,\" he\nadmitted. \"It works pretty well. It satisfies all my mental appetites.\nBut naturally there are instincts--\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nShe waited. He did not finish.\n\n\"What do you do about instincts that work and music and such things\ncan't satisfy?\"\n\nCalhoun grinned wrily;\n\n\"I'm stern with them. I have to be.\"\n\nHe stood up and plainly expected her to go into the other cabin for the\nnight. She did.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was after breakfast-time of the next ship-day when he got out the\nsample of clear liquid he'd worked so long to produce. \"We'll see how it\nworks,\" he observed. \"Murgatroyd's handy in case of a slip-up. It's\nperfectly safe so long as he's aboard and there are only the two of us.\"\n\nShe watched as he injected half a cc under his own skin. Then she\nshivered a little.\n\n\"What will it do?\"\n\n\"That remains to be seen.\" He paused a moment. \"You and I,\" he said with\nsome dryness, \"make a perfect test for anything. If you catch something\nfrom me, it will be infective indeed!\"\n\nShe gazed at him utterly without comprehension.\n\nHe took his own temperature. He brought out the folios which were his\norders, covering each of the planets he should give a standard Medical\nService inspection. Weald was there. Dara wasn't. But a Med Service man\nhas much freedom of action, even when only keeping up the routine of\nnormal Med Service. When catching up on badly neglected operations, he\nnecessarily has much more. Calhoun went over the folios.\n\nTwo hours later he took his temperature again. He looked pleased. He\nmade an entry in the ship's log. Two hours later yet he found himself\ndrinking thirstily and looked more pleased still. He made another entry\nin the log and matter-of-factly drew a small quantity of blood from his\nown vein and called to Murgatroyd. Murgatroyd submitted amiably to the\nvery trivial operation Calhoun carried out. Calhoun put away the\nequipment and saw Maril staring at him with a certain look of shock.\n\n\"It doesn't hurt him,\" Calhoun explained. \"Right after he's born there's\na tiny spot on his flank that has the pain-nerves desensitized.\nMurgatroyd's all right. That's what he's for!\"\n\n\"But he's--your friend!\"\n\n\"He's my assistant. I don't ask anything of him that I can do myself.\nBut we're both Med Service. And I do things for him that he can't do for\nhimself. For example, I make coffee for him.\"\n\nMurgatroyd heard the familiar word. He said;\n\n\"_Chee!_\"\n\n\"Very well,\" agreed Calhoun. \"We'll all have some.\"\n\nHe made coffee. Murgatroyd sipped at the cup especially made for his\nlittle paws. Once he scratched at the place on his flank which had no\npain-nerves. It itched. But he was perfectly content. Murgatroyd would\nalways be contented when he was somewhere near Calhoun.\n\nAnother hour went by. Murgatroyd climbed up into Calhoun's lap and with\na determined air went to sleep there. Calhoun disturbed him long enough\nto get an instrument out of his pocket. He listened to Murgatroyd's\nheartbeat with it while Murgatroyd dozed.\n\n\"Maril,\" he said. \"Write down something for me. The time, and\nninety-six, and one-twenty over ninety-four.\"\n\nShe obeyed, not comprehending. Half an hour later--still not stirring to\ndisturb Murgatroyd--he had her write down another time and sequence of\nfigures, only slightly different from the first. Half an hour later\nstill, a third set. But then he put Murgatroyd down, well satisfied.\n\nHe took his own temperature. He nodded.\n\n\"Murgatroyd and I have one more chore to do,\" he told her. \"Would you go\nin the other cabin for a moment?\"\n\nShe went disturbedly into the other cabin. Calhoun drew a sample of\nblood from the insensitive area on Murgatroyd's flank. Murgatroyd\nsubmitted with complete confidence in the man. In ten minutes Calhoun\nhad diluted the sample, added an anticoagulant, shaken it up thoroughly,\nand filtered it to clarity with all red and white corpuscles removed.\nAnother Med Ship man would have considered that Calhoun had had\nMurgatroyd prepare a splendid small sample of antibody-containing serum,\nin case something got out of hand. It would assuredly take care of two\npatients.\n\nBut a Med Ship man would also have known that it was simply one of those\nscrupulous precautions a Med Ship man takes when using cultures from\nstore.\n\nCalhoun put the sample away and called Maril back and offered no\nexplanation. She said;\n\n\"I'll fix lunch.\" She hesitated. \"You brought some food from the first\nWeald ship. Do you want it?\"\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"I'm squeamish,\" he admitted. \"The trouble on Dara is Med Service fault.\nBefore my time, but still--I'll stick to rations until everybody eats.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe watched her unobtrusively as the day went on. Presently he considered\nthat she was slightly flushed. Shortly after the evening meal of\nsingularly unappetizing Darian rations, she drank thirstily. He did not\ncomment. He brought out cards and showed her a complicated game of\nsolitaire in which mental arithmetic and expert use of probability\nincreased one's chance of winning.\n\nBy midnight, ship-time, she'd learned the game and played it absorbedly.\nCalhoun was able to scrutinize her without appearing to do so, and he\nwas satisfied again. When he mentioned that the Med Ship should arrive\noff Dara in eight hours more, she put the cards away and went into the\nother cabin.\n\nCalhoun wrote up the log. He added the notes that Maril had made for\nhim, of Murgatroyd's pulse and blood-pressure after the injection of the\nsame culture that produced fever and thirstiness in himself and\nlater--without contact with him or the culture--in Maril. He put a\nprofessional comment at the end.\n\n\"The culture seems to have retained its normal characteristics during\nlong storage in the spore state. It revived and reproduced rapidly. I\ninjected .5 cc under my skin and in less than one hour my temperature\nwas 30.8\u00b0C. An hour later it was 30.9\u00b0C. This was its peak. It\nimmediately returned to normal. The only other observable symptom was\nslightly increased thirst. Blood-pressure and pulse remained normal. The\nother person in the Med Ship displayed the same symptoms, in prompt and\ncomplete repetition, without physical contact.\"\n\nHe went to sleep, with Murgatroyd curled up in his cubbyhole.\n\nThe Med Ship broke out of overdrive at 1300 hours, ship time. Calhoun\nmade contact with the grid and was promptly lowered to the ground.\n\nIt was almost two hours later--1500 hours ship-time--when the people of\nDara were informed by broadcast that Calhoun was publicly to be\nexecuted; immediately.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7\n\n\nFrom the viewpoint of Darians, the decision of Calhoun's guilt and the\ndecision to execute him were reasonable enough. Maril protested\nfiercely, and her testimony agreed with Calhoun's in every respect, but\nfrom a blueskin viewpoint their own statements were damning.\n\nCalhoun had taken four young astrogators to space. They were the only\nsemi-skilled space-pilots Dara had. There were no fully qualified men.\nCalhoun had asked for them, and taken them out to emptiness, and there\nhe had instructed them in modern guidance-methods for ships of space. So\nfar there was no disagreement. He'd proposed to make them more competent\npilots; more capable of driving a ship to Orede, for example, to raid\nthe enormous cattle-herds there. And he'd had them drive the Med Ship to\nWeald, against which there could be no objection.\n\nBut just before arrival he had tricked all four of them by giving them\ndrugged coffee. He'd destroyed the lethal bacterial cultures they'd been\nordered to dump on Weald. Then he'd sent the four student pilots off\nseparately--so he and Maril claimed--in huge ships crammed with grain.\nBut those ships were not to be believed in, anyhow. Nobody on Dara could\nimagine stores of food bought up and stored away because it was useless;\nto keep up prices. Nobody believed in shiploads of grain to be had for\nthe taking. They did know that the only four partially experienced\nspace-pilots on Dara had been taken away and by Calhoun's own story sent\nout of the ship after they'd been drugged. Had they been trained, and\nhad they been helped or even permitted to sow the seeds of plague on\nWeald, and had they come back prepared to pass on training to other men\nto handle other space-ships now feverishly being built in hidden places\non Dara,--why--then Dara might have a chance of survival. But a\nspace-battle with only partly trained pilots would be hazardous at best.\nWith no trained pilots at all, it would be hopeless. So Calhoun, by his\nown story, appeared to have doomed every living being on Dara to\nmassacre from the bombs of Weald.\n\nIt was this last angle which destroyed any chance of anybody believing\nin such fairy-tale objects as ships loaded down with grain. Calhoun had\nshattered Dara's feeble hope of resistance. Weald had some ships and\ncould build or buy others faster than Dara could hope to construct them.\nEqually important, Weald had a plenitude of experienced spacemen to man\nsome ships fully and train the crews of others. If it had become\ndesperately busy fighting plague, then a fleet to exterminate life on\nDara would be delayed. Dara might have gained time at least to build\nships which could ram their enemies and destroy them that way.\n\nBut Calhoun had made it impossible. If he told the truth and Weald\nalready had a fleet of huge ships which only needed to be emptied of\ngrain and filled with guns and men--why--Dara was doomed. But if he did\nnot tell the truth it was equally doomed by his actions. So Calhoun\nwould be killed.\n\nHis execution was to take place in the open space of the landing-grid,\nwith vision-cameras transmitting the sight over all the blueskin planet.\nHalf-starved men, with grisly blue blotches on their skins, marched him\nto the center of the largest level space on the planet which was not\ndesperately being cultivated. Their hatred showed in their expressions.\nBitterness and fury surrounded Calhoun like a wall. Most of Dara would\nhave liked to see him killed in a manner as atrocious as his crime, but\nno conceivable death would be satisfying.\n\nSo the affair was coldly businesslike, with not even insults offered to\nhim. He was left to stand alone in the very center of the landing-grid\nfloor. There were a hundred blasters which would fire upon him at the\nsame instant. He would not only be killed; he would be destroyed. He\nwould be vaporized by the blue-white flames poured upon him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis death was remarkably close. Nothing remained but the order to fire,\nwhen loudspeakers from the landing-grid office froze everything. One of\nthe grain-ships from Weald had broken out of overdrive and its pilot was\ntriumphantly calling for landing-co\u00f6rdinates. The grid office relayed\nhis call to loudspeaker circuits as the quickest way to get it on the\ncommunication system of the whole planet.\n\n\"_Calling ground_,\" boomed the triumphant voice of the first of the\nstudent pilots Calhoun had trained. \"_Calling ground! Pilot Franz in\ncaptured ship requests co\u00f6rdinates for landing! Purpose of landing, to\ndeliver half a million bushels of grain captured from the enemy!_\"\n\nAt first, nobody dared believe it. But the pilot could be seen on\nvision. He was known. No blueskin would be left alive long enough to be\nused as a decoy by the men of Weald! Presently the giant ship on its\nsecond voyage to Dara--the first had been a generation ago, when it\nthreatened death and destruction--appeared as a dark pinpoint in the\nsky. It came down and down, and presently it hovered over the center of\nthe tarmac, where Calhoun composedly stood on the spot where he was to\nhave been executed.\n\nThe landing-grid crew shifted the ship to one side, and only then did\nCalhoun stroll in a leisurely fashion toward the Med Ship by the grid's\nmetal-lace wall.\n\nThe big ship touched ground, and its exit-port revolved and opened, and\nthe student pilot stood there grinning and heaving out handsful of\ngrain. There was a swarming, yelling, deliriously triumphant crowd,\nthen, where only minutes before there'd been a mob waiting to rejoice\nwhen Calhoun's living body exploded into flame.\n\nThey no longer hated Calhoun, but he had to fight his way to the Med\nShip, nevertheless. He was surrounded by now-ecstatically admiring\ncitizens of Dara, only minutes since they'd thirsted for his blood.\n\nTwo hours after the first ship, a second landed. Dara went wild again.\nFour hours later still, the third arrived. The fourth came down on the\nfollowing day.\n\nThen Calhoun faced the executive and cabinet of Dara for the second\ntime. His tone and manner were very dry.\n\n\"Now,\" he said curtly, \"I would like a few more astrogators to train. I\nthink it likely that we can raid the Wealdian grain-fleet one time more,\nand in so doing get the beginning of a fleet for defense. I insist,\nhowever, that it must not be used in combat! We might as well be\nsensible about this situation! After all, four shiploads of grain won't\nbreak the famine! They'll help a lot, but they're only the beginning of\nwhat's needed for a planetary population!\"\n\n\"How much grain can we hope for?\" demanded a man with a blue mark\ncovering all his chin.\n\nCalhoun told him.\n\n\"How long before Weald can have a fleet overhead, dropping fusion\nbombs?\" demanded another, grimly.\n\nCalhoun named a time. But then he said;\n\n\"I think we can keep them from dropping bombs if we can get the\ngrain-fleet and some capable astrogators.\"\n\n\"What do you have in mind?\"\n\nHe told them. It was not possible to tell the whole story of what he\nconsidered sensible behavior. An emotional program can be presented and\naccepted immediately. A plan of action which is actually intelligent,\nconsidering all elements of a situation, has to be accepted piecemeal.\nEven so, the military men growled.\n\n\"We've plenty of heavy elements,\" said one, with one eye and half his\nforehead colored blue. \"If we'd used our brains, we'd have more bombs\nthan Weald can hope for! We could turn that whole planet into a smoking\ncinder!\"\n\n\"Which,\" said Calhoun acidly, \"would give you some satisfaction but not\nan ounce of food! And food's more important than satisfaction. Now, I'm\ngoing to take off for Weald again. I'll want somebody to build an\nemergency device for my ship, and I'll want the four pilots I've trained\nand twenty more candidates. And I'd like to have some decent rations!\nWhen the last trip brought back two million bushels of grain, you can\nspare adequate food for twenty men for a few days!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt took some time to get the special device constructed, but the Med\nShip lifted in two days more. The device for which it had waited was\nsimply a preventive of the disaster overtaking the ship from the mine on\nOrede. It was essentially a tank of liquid oxygen, packed in the space\nfrom which stores had been taken away. When the ship's air-supply was\npumped past it, first moisture and then CO2 froze out. Then the air\nflowed over the liquefied oxygen at a rate to replace the CO2 with more\nuseful breathing material. Then the moisture was restored to the air as\nit warmed again. For so long as the oxygen lasted, fresh air for any\nnumber of men could be kept purified and breathable. The Med Ship's\nnormal equipment could take care of no more than ten. But with this it\ncould journey to Weald with almost any complement on board.\n\nMaril stayed on Dara when the Med Ship left. Murgatroyd protested\nshrilly when he discovered her about to be closed out by the closing\nlock-door.\n\n\"_Chee!_\" he said indignantly. \"_Chee! Chee!_\"\n\n\"No,\" said Calhoun, \"we'll be crowded enough anyhow. We'll see her\nlater.\"\n\nHe nodded to one of the first four student pilots, and he crisply made\ncontact with the landing-grid office. He very efficiently supervised as\nthe grid took the ship up. The other three of the four first-trained men\nexplained every move to sub-classes assigned to each. Calhoun moved\nabout, listening and making certain that the instruction was up to\nstandard.\n\nHe felt queer, acting as the supervisor of an educational institution in\nspace. He did not like it. There were twenty-four men beside himself\ncrowded into the Med Ship's small interior. They got in each other's\nway. They trampled on each other. There was always somebody eating, and\nalways somebody sleeping, and there was no need whatever for the\nbackground tape to keep the ship from being intolerably quiet. But the\nair-system worked well enough, except once when the reheater unit quit\nand the air inside the ship went down below freezing before the trouble\ncould be found and corrected.\n\nThe journey to Weald, this time, took seven days because of the training\nprogram in effect. Calhoun bit his nails over the delay. But it was\nnecessary for each of the students to make his own line-ups on Weald's\nsun, and compute distances, and for each of them to practise\nmaneuverings that would presently be called for. Calhoun hoped\ndesperately that preparations for active warfare--or massacre--did not\nmove fast on Weald. He believed, however, that in the absence of direct\nnews from Dara, Wealdian officials would take the normal course of\npoliticos. They had proclaimed the deathship from Orede an attack from\nDara. Therefore they would specialize on defensive measures before\nplumping for offense. They'd get patrol-ships out to spot invasion ships\nlong before they worked on a fleet to destroy the blueskins. It would\nmeet the public demand for defense.\n\nCalhoun was right. The Med Ship made its final approach to Weald under\nCalhoun's own control. He'd made brightness-measurements on his previous\njourney and he used them again. They would not be strictly accurate,\nbecause a sunspot could knock all meaning out of any reading beyond two\ndecimal places. But the first breakout was just far enough from the\nWealdian system for Calhoun to be able to pick out its planets with\nelectron telescope at maximum magnification. He could aim for Weald\nitself,--allowing, of course, for the lag in the apparent motion of its\nimage because of the limited speed of light. He tried the briefest of\noverdrive hops, and came out within the solar system and well inside any\nwatching patrol.\n\nThat was pure fortune. It continued. He'd broken through the screen of\nguard-ships in undetectable overdrive. He was within half an hour's\nsolar-system drive of the grain-fleet. There was no alarm, at first. Of\ncourse radars spotted the Med Ship as an object, but nobody paid\nattention. It was not headed for Weald. It was probably assumed to be a\nguard-boat itself. Such mistakes do happen. It reached the grain-fleet.\n\nAgain from the storage-space from which supplies had been removed,\nCalhoun produced vacuum suits. The four first students went out, each\nescorting a less-accustomed neophyte and all fastened firmly together\nwith space-ropes. They warmed the interiors of four ships and went on to\nothers. Presently there were eight ships making ready for an\ninterstellar journey, each with a scared but resolute new pilot\nfamiliarizing himself with its controls. There were sixteen ships.\nTwenty. Twenty-three.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA guard-ship came humming out from Weald. It would be armed, of course.\nIt came droning, droning up the forty-odd thousand miles from the\nplanet. Calhoun swore. He could not call his students and tell them what\nwas happening. The guard-ship would overhear. He could not trust untried\nyoung men to act rationally if they were unwarned and the guard-ship\narrived and matter-of-factly attempted to board one of them.\n\nThen he was inspired. He called Murgatroyd, placed him before the\ncommunicator, and set it at voice-only transmission. This was familiar\nenough, to Murgatroyd. He'd often seen Calhoun use a communicator.\n\n\"_Chee!_\" shrilled Murgatroyd. \"_Chee-chee!_\"\n\nA startled voice came out of the speaker.\n\n\"_What's that?_\"\n\n\"_Chee_,\" said Murgatroyd zestfully.\n\nThe communicator was talking to him. Murgatroyd adored three things in\norder. One was Calhoun. The second was coffee. The third was pretending\nto converse like a human being. The speaker said explosively;\n\n\"_You there, identify yourself!_\"\n\n\"_Chee-chee-chee-chee!_\" observed Murgatroyd. He wriggled with pleasure\nand added, reasonably enough, \"_Chee!_\"\n\nThe communicator bawled;\n\n\"_Calling ground! Calling ground! Listen to this! Something that ain't\nhuman's talking at me on a communicator! Listen in an' tell me what to\ndo!_\"\n\nMurgatroyd interposed with another shrill;\n\n\"_Chee!_\"\n\nThen Calhoun pulled the Med Ship slowly away from the clump of\nstill-lifeless grain-ships. It was highly improbable that the guard-boat\nwould carry an electron telescope. Most likely it would have only an\necho-radar, and so could determine only that an object of some sort\nmoved of its own accord in space. Calhoun let the Med Ship accelerate.\nThat would be final evidence. The grain-ships were between Weald and its\nsun. Even electron telescopes on the ground--and electron-telescopes\nwere ultimately optical telescopes with electronic amplification--even\nelectron telescopes on the ground could not get a good image of the ship\nthrough sunlit atmosphere.\n\n\"_Chee?_\" asked Murgatroyd solicitously. \"_Chee-chee-chee?_\"\n\n\"_Is it blueskins?_\" shakily demanded the voice from the guard-boat.\n\"_Ground! Ground! Is it blueskins?_\"\n\nA heavy, authoritative voice came in with much greater volume.\n\n\"_That's no human voice_,\" it said harshly. \"_Approach its ship and send\nback an image. Don't fire first unless it heads for ground._\"\n\nThe guard-ship swerved and headed for the Med Ship. It was still a very\nlong way off.\n\n\"_Chee-chee_,\" said Murgatroyd encouragingly.\n\nCalhoun changed the Med Ship's course. The guard-ship changed course\ntoo. Calhoun let it draw nearer,--but only a little. He led it away from\nthe fleet of grain-ships.\n\nHe swung his electron telescope on them. He saw a space-suited figure\noutside one,--safely roped, however. It was easy to guess that someone\nhad meant to return to the Med Ship for orders or to make a report, and\nfound the Med Ship gone. He'd go back inside and turn on a communicator.\n\n\"_Chee!_\" said Murgatroyd.\n\nThe heavy voice boomed;\n\n\"_You there! This is a human-occupied world! If you come in peace, cut\nyour drive and let our guard-ship approach!_\"\n\nMurgatroyd replied in an interested but doubtful tone. The booming voice\nbellowed. Another voice of higher authority took over. Murgatroyd was\nentranced that so many people wanted to talk to him. He made what for\nhim was practically an oration. The last voice spoke persuasively and\nsuavely.\n\n\"_Chee-chee-chee-chee_,\" said Murgatroyd.\n\nOne of the grain-ships flickered and ceased to be. It had gone into\noverdrive. Another. And another. Suddenly they began to flick out of\nsight by twos and threes.\n\n\"_Chee_,\" said Murgatroyd with a note of finality.\n\nThe last grain-ship vanished.\n\n\"Calling guard-ship,\" said Calhoun drily. \"This is Med ship Aesclipus\nTwenty. I called here a couple of weeks ago. You've been talking to my\n_tormal_, Murgatroyd.\"\n\nA pause. A blank pause. Then profanity of deep and savage intemperance.\n\n\"I've been on Dara,\" said Calhoun.\n\nDead silence fell.\n\n\"There's a famine there,\" said Calhoun deliberately. \"So the grain-ships\nyou've had in orbit have been taken away by men from Dara--blueskins if\nyou like--to feed themselves and their families. They've been dying of\nhunger and they don't like it.\"\n\nThere was a single burst of the unprintable. Then the formerly suave\nvoice said waspishly;\n\n\"_Well? The Med Service will hear of your interference!_\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Calhoun. \"I'll report it myself. I have a message for you.\nDara is ready to pay for every ounce of grain and for the ships it was\nstored in. They'll pay in heavy metals,--iridium, uranium,--that sort of\nthing.\"\n\nThe suave voice fairly curdled.\n\n\"_As if we'd allow anything that was ever on Dara to touch ground\nhere!_\"\n\n\"Ah! But there can be sterilization. To begin with metals, uranium melts\nat 1150\u00b0 centigrade, and tungsten at 3370\u00b0 and iridium at 2350\u00b0. You\ncould load such things and melt them down in space and then tow them\nhome. And you can actually sterilize a lot of other useful materials!\"\n\nThe suave voice said infuriatedly;\n\n\"_I'll report this! You'll suffer for this!_\"\n\nCalhoun said pleasantly;\n\n\"I'm sure that what I say is being recorded, so that I'll add that it's\nperfectly practical for Wealdians to land on Dara, take whatever\nproperty they think wise,--to pay for damage done by blueskins, of\ncourse--and get back to Wealdian ships with absolutely no danger of\ncarrying contagion. If you'll make sure the recording's clear.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe described, clearly and specifically, exactly how a man could be\noutfitted to walk into any area of any conceivable contagion, do\nwhatever seemed necessary in the way of looting--but Calhoun did not use\nthe word--and then return to his fellows with no risk whatever of\nbringing back infection. He gave exact details. Then he said;\n\n\"My radar says you've four ships converging on me to blast me out of\nspace. I sign off.\"\n\nThe Med Ship disappeared from normal space, and entered that improbably\nstressed area of extension which it formed about itself and in which\nphysical constants were wildly strange. For one thing, the speed of\nlight in overdrive-stressed space had not been measured yet. It was too\nhigh. For another, a ship could travel very many times 186000 miles per\nsecond in overdrive.\n\nThe Med Ship did just that. There was nobody but Calhoun and Murgatroyd\non board. There was companionable silence,--there were only the small\nthreshold-of-perception sounds which one did not often notice, but which\nit would have been intolerable to have stop.\n\nCalhoun luxuriated in regained privacy. For seven days he'd had\ntwenty-four other human beings crowded into the two cabins of the ship,\nwith never so much as one yard of space between himself and someone\nelse. One need not be snobbish to wish to be alone sometimes!\n\nMurgatroyd licked his whiskers thoughtfully.\n\n\"I hope,\" said Calhoun, \"that things work out right. But they may\nremember on Dara that I'm responsible for some ten million bushels of\ngrain reaching them. Maybe--just possibly--they'll listen to me and act\nsensibly. After all, there's only one way to break a famine. Not with\nten million bushels for a whole planet! And certainly not with bombs!\"\n\nDriving direct, without pausing for practisings, the Med Ship could\narrive at Dara in little more than five days. Calhoun looked forward to\nrelaxation. As a beginning he made ready to give himself an adequate\nmeal for the first time since first landing on Dara. Then, presently, he\nsat down wrily to a double meal of Darian famine-rations, which were far\nfrom appetizing. But there wasn't anything else on board.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe had some pleasure later, though, envisioning what went elsewhere. On\nWeald, obviously, there would be purest panic. The vanishing of the\ngrain fleet wouldn't be charged against twenty-four men. A Darian fleet\nwould be suspected, and with the suspicion terror, and with terror a\ngovernmental crisis. Then there'd be a frantic seizure of any craft that\ncould take to space, and the agitated improvisation of a space-fleet.\n\nBut besides that, biological-warfare technicians would examine Calhoun's\ninstructions for equipment by which armed men could be landed on a\nplague-stricken planet and then safely taken off again. Military and\ngovernmental officials would come to the eminently sane conclusion that\nwhile Calhoun could not well take active measures against blueskins, as\na sane and proper citizen of the galaxy he would be on the side of law\nand order and propriety and justice,--in short, of Weald. So they\nordered sample anti-contagion suits made according to Calhoun's\ndirections, and they had them tested. They worked admirably.\n\nOn Dara, while Calhoun journeyed back to it, grain was distributed\nlavishly, and everybody on the planet had their cereal ration almost\ndoubled. It was still not a comfortable ration, but the relief was\ngreat. There was considerable gratitude felt for Calhoun, which as usual\nincluded a lively anticipation of further favors to come. Maril was\ninterviewed repeatedly, as the person best able to discuss him, and she\ndid his reputation no harm. That was not all that happened on Dara ...\n\nThere was something else. Very curious thing, too. There was a curious\nspread of mild symptoms which nobody could exactly call a disease. It\nlasted only a few hours. A person felt slightly feverish, and ran a\ntemperature which peaked at 30.9\u00b0 centigrade, and drank more water than\nusual. Then his temperature went back to normal and he forgot all about\nit. There have always been such trivial epidemics. They are rarely\nrecorded, because few people think to go to a doctor. That was the case\nhere.\n\nCalhoun looked ahead a little, too. Presently the fleet of grain-ships\nwould arrive and unload and lift again for Orede, and this time they\nwould make an infinity of slaughter among wild cattle-herds, and bring\nback incredible quantities of fresh-slaughtered frozen beef. Almost\neverybody would get to taste meat again, which would be most gratifying.\n\nThen, the industries of Dara would labor at government-required tasks.\nAn astonishing amount of fissionable material would be fashioned into\nbombs--a concession by Calhoun--and plastic factories make an\nastonishing number of plastic sag-suits. And large shipments of heavy\nmetals in ingots would be made to the planet's capital city and there\nwould be some guns and minor items....\n\nPerhaps somebody could have found out any of these items in advance, but\nit was unlikely that anybody did. Nobody but Calhoun, however, would\never have put them together and hoped very urgently that that was the\nway things would work out. He could see a promising total result. In\nfact, in the Med ship hurtling through space, on the fourth day of his\njourney he thought of an improvement that could be made in the sum of\nall those happenings when they were put together.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe landed on Dara. Maril came to the Med Ship. Murgatroyd greeted her\nwith enthusiasm.\n\n\"Something unusual has happened,\" said Maril, very much subdued. \"I told\nyou that--sometimes blueskin markings fade out on children, and then\nneither they nor their children ever have blueskin markings again.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Calhoun. \"I remember.\"\n\n\"And you were reminded of a group of viruses on Tralee. You said they\nonly took hold of people in terribly bad physical condition, but then\nthey could be passed on from mother to child. Until--sometimes--they\ndied out.\"\n\nCalhoun blinked.\n\n\"Yes....\"\n\n\"Korvan,\" said Maril very carefully, \"Has worked out an idea that that's\nwhat happens to the blueskin markings on--us Darians. He thinks that\npeople almost dead of the plague could get the--virus, and if they\nrecovered from the plague pass the virus on and--be blueskins.\"\n\n\"Interesting,\" said Calhoun, noncommittally.\n\n\"And when we went to Weald,\" said Maril very carefully indeed, \"you were\nworking with some culture-material. You wrote quite a lot about it in\nthe ship's log. You gave yourself an injection. Remember? And\nMurgatroyd? You wrote down your temperature, and Murgatroyd's?\" She\nmoistened her lips. \"You said that if infection passed between us,\nsomething would be very infectious indeed?\"\n\n\"What are you driving at?\"\n\nMaril continued slowly. \"Th--thousands of people are having their\npigment-spots fade away. Not only children but grownups. And--Korvan has\nfound out that it always seems to happen after a day when they felt\nfeverish and very thirsty--and then felt all right again. You tried out\nsomething that made you feverish and thirsty. I had it too, in the ship.\nKorvan thinks there's been an epidemic of something that--is\nobliterating the blue spots on everybody that catches it. There are\nalways trivial epidemics that nobody notices. Korvan's found evidence of\none that's making 'blueskin' no longer a word with any meaning.\"\n\n\"Remarkable!\" said Calhoun.\n\n\"Did you--do it?\" asked Maril. \"Did you start a harmless epidemic\nthat--wipes out the virus that makes blueskins?\"\n\nCalhoun said in feigned astonishment;\n\n\"How can you think such a thing, Maril?\"\n\n\"Because I was there,\" said Maril. She said somehow desperately; \"I know\nyou did it! But the question is--are you going to tell? When people find\nthey're not blueskins any longer--when there's no such thing as a\nblueskin any longer--will you tell them why?\"\n\n\"Naturally not,\" said Calhoun. \"Why?\" Then he guessed. \"Has Korvan--.\"\n\n\"He thinks,\" said Maril, \"that he thought it up all by himself. He's\nfound the proof. He's--very proud. I'd have to tell him the truth if you\nwere going to tell. And he'd be ashamed and--angry.\"\n\nCalhoun considered, staring at her.\n\n\"How it happened doesn't matter,\" he said at last. \"The idea of anybody\ndoing it deliberately would be disturbing, too. It shouldn't get about.\nSo it seems much the best thing for Korvan to discover what's happened\nto the blueskin pigment, and how it happened, but not why.\"\n\nShe read his face carefully.\n\n\"You aren't doing it as a favor to me,\" she decided. \"You'd rather it\nwas that way.\"\n\nShe looked at him for a long time, until he squirmed. Then she nodded\nand went away.\n\nAn hour later the Wealdian space-fleet was reported, massed in space and\ndriving for Dara.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 8\n\n\nThere were small scout-ships which came on ahead of the main fleet.\nThey'd originally been guard-boats, intended for solar-system duty only\nand quite incapable of overdrive. They'd come from Weald in the\ncargo-holds of the liners now transformed into fighting ships. The\nscouts swept low, transmitting fine-screen images back to the fleet, of\nall that they might see before they were shot down. They found the\nlanding-grid. It contained nothing larger than Calhoun's Med Ship,\nAesclipus Twenty.\n\nThey searched here and there. They flitted to and fro, scanning wide\nbands of the surface of Dara. The planet's cities and highways and\nindustrial centers were wholly open to inspection from the sky. It\nlooked as if the scouts hunted most busily for the fleet of former\ngrain-ships which Calhoun had said blueskins had seized and rushed away.\nIf the scouts looked for them, they did not find them.\n\nDara offered no opposition to the scout-ships. Nothing rose to space to\noppose or to resist their search. They went darting over every portion\nof the hungry planet, land and seas alike, and there was no sign of\nmilitary preparedness against their coming. The huge ships of the main\nfleet waited while they reported monotonously that they saw no sign of\nthe stolen fleet. But the stolen fleet was the only means by which the\nplanet could be defended. There could be no point in a pitched battle in\nemptiness. But a fleet with a planet to back it might be dangerous.\n\nHours passed. The Wealdian main fleet waited. There was no offensive\nmovement by the fleet. There was no defensive action from the ground,\nWith fusion-bombs certain to be involved in any actual conflict, there\nwas something like an embarrassed pause. The Wealdian ships were ready\nto bomb. They were less anxious to be vaporized by possible\nsuicide-dashes of defending ships who might blow themselves up near\ncontact with their enemies.\n\nBut a fleet cannot travel some light-years through space to make a mere\nthreat. And the Wealdian fleet was furnished with the material for total\ndevastation. It could drop bombs from hundreds, or thousands, or even\ntens of thousands of miles away. It could cover the world of Dara with\nmushroom clouds springing up and spreading to make a continuous pall of\natomic-fusion products. And they could settle down and kill every living\nthing not destroyed by the explosions themselves. Even the creatures of\nthe deepest oceans would die of deadly, purposely-contrived fallout\nparticles.\n\nThe Wealdian fleet contemplated its own destructiveness. It found no\ncapacity for defense on Dara. It moved forward.\n\nBut then a message went out from the capital city of Dara. It said that\na ship in overdrive had carried word to a Darian fleet in space. The\nDarian fleet now hurtled toward Weald. It was a fleet of thirty-seven\ngiant ships. They carried such-and-such bombs in such-and-such\nquantities. Unless its orders were countermanded, it would deliver those\nbombs on Weald--set to explode. If Weald bombed Dara, the orders could\nnot be withdrawn. So Weald could bomb Dara. It could destroy all life on\nthe pariah planet. But Weald would die with it.\n\nThe fleet ceased its advance. The situation was a stalemate with pure\ndesperation on one side and pure frustration on the other. This was no\nway to end the war. Neither planet could trust the other, even for\nminutes. If they did not destroy each other simultaneously, as now was\npossible, each would expect the other to launch an unwarned attack at\nsome other moment. Ultimately one or the other must perish, and the\nsurvivor would be the one most skilled in treachery.\n\nBut then the pariah planet made a new proposal. It would send a\nmessenger-ship to stop its own fleet's bombardment if Weald would accept\npayment for the grain-ships and their cargoes. It would pay in ingots of\niridium and uranium and tungsten--and gold if Weald wished it--for all\ndamages Weald might claim. It would even pay indemnity for the miners of\nOrede, who had died by accident but perhaps in some sense through its\nfault. It would pay.... But if it were bombed, Weald must spout atomic\nfire and the fleet of Weald would have no home planet to return to.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis proposal seemed both craven and foolish. It would allow the fleet\nof Weald to loot and then betray Dara. But it was Calhoun's idea. It\nseemed plausible to the admirals of Weald. They felt only contempt for\nblueskins. Contemptuously, they accepted the semi-surrender.\n\nThe broadcast waves of Dara told of agreement, and wild and fierce\nresentment filled the pariah planet's people. There was\nalmost--almost!--revolution to insist upon resistance, however hopeless\nand however fatal. But not all of Dara realized that a vital change had\ncome about in the state of things on Dara. The enemy fleet had not a\nhint of it. And therefore--\n\nIn menacing array, the invading fleet spread itself about the skies of\nDara, well beyond the atmosphere. Harsh voices talked with increasing\narrogance to the landing-grid staff. A monster ship of Weald came\nheavily down, riding the landing-grid's force-fields. It touched gently.\nIts occupants were apprehensive, but hungry for the loot they had been\nassured was theirs. The ship's outer hull would be sterilized before it\nreturned to Weald, of course. And there was adequate protection for the\nlanding-party.\n\nMen came out of the ship's ports. They wore the double, transparent\nsag-suits Calhoun had suggested, which had been painstakingly tested,\nand which were perfect protection against contagion. They could loot\nwith impunity, and all contamination would remain outside the suits.\nWhat loot they gathered, obviously, could be decontaminated before it\nwas returned to Weald. It was a most satisfactory discovery, to realize\nthat blueskins could be not only scorned but robbed. There was only one\nbit of relevant information the space-fleet of Weald did not have.\n\nThat information was that the people of Dara weren't blueskins any\nlonger. There'd been a trivial epidemic.\n\nThe sag-suited men of Weald went zestfully about their business. They\ntook over the landing-grid's operation, driving the Darian operators\naway. For the first time in history the operators of a landing-grid wore\nmakeup to look like they did have blue pigment in their skins. The\nWealdian landing-party tested the grid's operation. They brought down\nanother giant ship. Then another. And another.\n\nParties in the shiny sag-suits spread through the city. There were the\nhuge stock-piles of precious metals, brought in readiness to be\nsurrendered and carried away. Some men set to work to load these into\nthe holds--to be sterilized later. Some went forthrightly after personal\nloot.\n\nThey came upon very few Darians. Those they saw kept sullenly away from\nthem. They entered shops and took what they fancied. They zestfully\nremoved the treasure of banks.\n\nTriumphal and scornful reports went up to the hovering great ships. The\nblueskins, said the reports were spiritless and cowardly. They permitted\nthemselves to be robbed. They kept out of the way. It had been observed\nthat the population was streaming out of the city, fleeing because they\nfeared the ships' landing-parties. The blueskins had abjectly produced\nall they'd promised of precious metals, but there was more to be taken.\n\nMore ships came down, and more. Some of the first, heavily loaded, were\nlifted to emptiness again and the process of decontamination of their\nhulls began. There was jealousy among the ships in space for those upon\nthe ground. The first-landed ships had had their choice of loot. There\nwere squabblings about priorities, now that the navy of Weald plainly\nhad a license to steal. There was confusion among the members of the\nlanding-parties. Discipline disappeared. Men in plastic sag-suits roved\nabout as individuals, seeking what they might loot.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere were armed and alerted landing-parties around the grid itself, of\ncourse, but the capital city of Dara lay open. Men coming back with loot\nfound their ships already lifted off to make room for others. They were\npushed into re\u00ebmbarking-parties of other ships. There were more and more\nmen to be found on ships where they did not belong, and more and more\nnot to be found where they did. By the time half the fleet had been\naground, there was no longer any pretense of holding a ship down until\nall its crew returned. There were too many other ships' companies\nclamoring for their turn to loot. The rosters of many ships, indeed,\nbore no particular relationship to the men actually on board.\n\nThere were less than fifteen ships whose to-be-fumigated holds were\nstill empty, when the watchful government of Dara broadcast a new\nmessage to the invaders. It requested that the looting stop. No matter\nwhat payment Weald claimed, it had taken payment five times over. Now\nwas time to stop.\n\nIt was amusing. The space-admiral of Weald ordered his ships alerted for\naction. The message-ship, ordering the Darian fleet away from Weald,\nhad been sent off long since. No other ship could get away now! The\nDarians could take their choice; accept the consequences of surrender,\nor the fleet would rise to throw down bombs.\n\nCalhoun was asking politely to be taken to the Wealdian admiral when the\ntrouble began. It wasn't on the ground, at all. Everything was under\nsplendid control where a landing-force occupied the grid and all the\nground immediately about it. The space admiral had headquarters in the\nlanding-grid office. Reports came in, orders were issued, admirably\ncrisp salutes were exchanged among sag-suited men.... Everything was in\nperfect shape there.\n\nBut there was panic among the ships in space. Communicators gave off\nhorrified, panic-stricken yells. There were screamings. Intelligible\ncommunications ceased. Ships plunged crazily this way and that. Some\nvanished in overdrive. At least one plunged at full power into a Darian\nocean.\n\nThe space-admiral found himself in command of fifteen ships only, out of\nall his former force. The rest of the fleet went through a period of\nhysterical madness. In some ships it lasted for minutes only. In others\nit went on for half an hour or more. Then they hung overhead, but did\nnot reply to calls.\n\nCalhoun arrived at the space-port with Murgatroyd riding on his\nshoulder. A bewildered officer in a sag-suit halted him.\n\n\"I've come,\" said Calhoun, \"to speak to the admiral. My name is Calhoun\nand I'm Med Service, and I think I met the Admiral at a banquet a few\nweeks ago. He'll remember me.\"\n\n\"You'll have to wait,\" protested the officer. \"There's some trouble--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Calhoun. \"I know about it. I helped design it. I want to\nexplain it to the admiral. He needs to know what's happened, if he's to\ntake appropriate measures.\"\n\nThere were jitterings. Many men in sag-suits had still no idea that\nanything had gone wrong. Some appeared, brightly carrying loot. Some\nhung eagerly around the airlocks of ships on the grid tarmac, waiting\ntheir turns to stand in corrosive gases for the decontamination of their\nsuits, when they would burn the outer layers and step, aseptic and\nhappy, into a Wealdian ship again. There they could think how rich they\nwere going to be back on Weald.\n\nBut the situation aloft was bewildering and very, very ominous. There\nwas strident argument. Presently Calhoun stood before the Wealdian\nadmiral.\n\n\"I came to explain something,\" said Calhoun pleasantly. \"The situation\nhas changed. You've noticed it, I'm sure.\"\n\nThe admiral glared at him through two layers of plastic, which covered\nhim almost like a gift-wrapped parcel.\n\n\"Be quick!\" he rasped.\n\n\"First,\" said Calhoun, \"there are no more blueskins. An epidemic of\nsomething or other has made the blue patches on the skins of Darians\nfade out. There have always been some who didn't have blue patches. Now\nnobody has them.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" rasped the admiral. \"And what has that got to do with this\nsituation?\"\n\n\"Why, everything,\" said Calhoun mildly. \"It means that Darians can pass\nfor Wealdians whenever they please. That they are passing for Wealdians.\nThat they've been mixing with your men, wearing sag-suits exactly like\nthe one you're wearing now. They've been going aboard your ships in the\nconfusion of returning looters. There's not a ship now aloft, that has\nbeen aground today, that hasn't from one to fifteen Darians--no longer\nblueskins--on board.\"\n\nThe admiral roared. Then his face turned gray.\n\n\"You can't take your fleet back to Weald,\" said Calhoun gently, \"if you\nbelieve its crews have been exposed to carriers of the Dara plague. You\nwouldn't be allowed to land, anyhow.\"\n\nThe admiral said through stiff lips;\n\n\"I'll blast--\"\n\n\"No,\" said Calhoun, again gently. \"When you ordered all ships alerted\nfor action, the Darians on each ship released panic-gas. They only\nneeded tiny, pocket-sized containers of the gas for the job. They had\nthem. They only needed to use air-tanks from their sag-suits to protect\nthemselves against the gas. They kept them handy. On nearly all your\nships aloft your crews are crazy from panic-gas. They'll stay that way\nuntil the air is changed. Darians have barricaded themselves in the\ncontrol-rooms of most if not all your ships. You haven't got a fleet. If\nthe few ships that will obey your orders, drop one bomb, our fleet off\nWeald will drop fifty. I don't think you'd better order offensive\naction. Instead, I think you'd better have your fleet medical officers\ncome and learn some of the facts of life. There's no need for war\nbetween Dara and Weald, but if you insist....\"\n\nThe Admiral made a choking noise. He could have ordered Calhoun killed,\nbut there was a certain appalling fact. The men aground from the fleet\nwere breathing Wealdian air from tanks. It would last so long only. If\nthey were taken on board the still obedient ships overhead, Darians\nwould unquestionably be mixed with them. There was no way to take off\nthe parties now aground without exposing them to contact with Darians,\non the ground or in the ships. There was no way to sort out the Darians.\n\n\"I--I will give the orders,\" said the admiral thickly. \"I--do not know\nwhat you devils plan, but--I don't know how to stop you.\"\n\n\"All that's necessary,\" said Calhoun warmly, \"is an open mind. There's a\nmisunderstanding to be cleared up, and some principles of planetary\nhealth practises to be explained, and a certain amount of prejudice that\nhas to be thrown away. But nobody need die of changing their minds. The\nInterstellar Medical service has proved that over and over!\"\n\nMurgatroyd, perched on his shoulder, felt that it was time to take part\nin the conversation. He said;\n\n\"_Chee-chee!_\"\n\n\"Yes,\" agreed Calhoun. \"We do want to get the job done. We're behind\nschedule now.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was not, of course, possible for Calhoun to leave immediately. He had\nto preside at various meetings of the medical officers of the fleet with\nthe health officials of Dara. He had to make explanations, and correct\nmisapprehensions, and delicately suggest such biological experiments as\nwould prove to the doctors of Weald that there was no longer a plague on\nDara, whatever had been the case three generations before. He had to sit\nby while an extremely self-confident young Darian doctor named Korvan\nrather condescendingly demonstrated that the former blue pigmentation\nwas a viral product quite unconnected with the plague, and that it had\nbeen wiped out by a very trivial epidemic of--such and such. Calhoun\nregarded that young man with a detached interest. Maril thought him\nwonderful, even if she had to give him the material for his work.\nCalhoun shrugged and went on with his work.\n\nThe return of loot. Mutual, full, and complete agreement that Darians\nwere no longer carriers of plague, if they had ever been. Unless Weald\nconvinced other worlds of this, Weald itself would join Dara in\nisolation from neighboring worlds. A messenger ship to recall the\ntwenty-seven ships once floating in orbit about Weald. Most of them\nwould be used for some time, now, to bring beef from Orede. Some would\nhaul more grain from Weald. It would be paid for. There would be a need\nfor commercial missions to be exchanged between Weald and Dara.\n\nIt was a full week before he could go to the little Med Ship and prepare\nfor departure. Even then there were matters to be attended to. All the\nfood-supplies that had been removed could not be replaced. There were\nbiological samples to be replaced and some to be destroyed.... The\nair-tanks....\n\nMaril came to the Med Ship again when he was almost ready to leave. She\ndid not seem comfortable.\n\n\"I wish you could like Korvan,\" she said regretfully.\n\n\"I don't dislike him,\" said Calhoun. \"I think he will be a most\nprominent citizen, in time. He has all the talents for it.\"\n\nMaril smiled very faintly.\n\n\"But you don't admire him.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't say that,\" protested Calhoun. \"After all, he is attractive\nto you, which is something I couldn't manage.\"\n\n\"You didn't try,\" said Maril. \"Just as I didn't try to be fascinating to\nyou. Why?\"\n\nCalhoun spread out his hands. But he looked at Maril with respect. Not\nevery woman could have faced the fact that a man did not feel impelled\nto make passes at her. It is simply a fact that has nothing to do with\ndesirability or charm or anything else.\n\n\"You're going to marry him,\" he said. \"I hope you'll be very happy.\"\n\n\"He's the man I want,\" said Maril frankly. \"He looks forward to splendid\ndiscoveries. I'm sorry it's so important to him.\"\n\nCalhoun did not ask the obvious question. Instead, he said thoughtfully;\n\n\"There's something you could do.... It needs to be done. The Med Service\nin this sector has been badly handled. There are a number\nof--discoveries that need to be made. I don't think your Korvan would\nrelish having things handed to him on a visible silver platter. But they\nshould be known....\"\n\nMaril said wrily;\n\n\"I can guess what you mean. I never went into detail about how the\nblueskin markings disappeared, but a few hints--You've got books for\nme?\"\n\nCalhoun nodded. He brought them to her.\n\n\"If we only fell in love with each other, Maril, we'd be a team! Too\nbad! These are a wedding present you'll do well to hide.\"\n\nShe put her hands in his.\n\n\"I like you--almost as much as I like Murgatroyd! Yes! Korvan will never\nknow, and he'll be a great man.\" Then she added defensively, \"And not\njust from these books! He'll make his own wonderful discoveries.\"\n\n\"Of which,\" said Calhoun, \"the most remarkable is you. Good luck\nMaril!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPresently the Med Ship lifted. Calhoun aimed it for the next planet on\nthe list of those he was to visit. After this one more he'd return to\nsector headquarters with a biting report to make on the way things had\nbeen handled before him. He said;\n\n\"Overdrive coming, Murgatroyd!\"\n\nThen the stars went out and there was silence, and privacy, and a faint,\nfaint, almost unhearable series of background sounds which kept the Med\nShip from being totally unendurable.\n\nLong, long days later the ship broke out of overdrive and Calhoun guided\nit to a round and sunlit world. In due time he thumped the\ncommunicator-button.\n\n\"Calling ground,\" he said crisply. \"Calling ground! Med Ship Aesclipus\nTwenty reporting arrival and asking co\u00f6rdinates for landing. Purpose of\nlanding, planetary health inspection. Our mass is fifty standard tons.\"\n\nThere was a pause while the beamed message went many, many thousands of\nmiles. Then the speaker said;\n\n\"_Aesclipus Twenty, repeat your identification!_\"\n\nMurgatroyd said;\n\n\"_Chee-chee? Chee?_\"\n\nCalhoun sighed.\n\n\"That's right, Murgatroyd! Here we go again!\"\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Pariah Planet, by Murray Leinster\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PARIAH PLANET ***\n\n***** This file should be named 29448-8.txt or 29448-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/9/4/4/29448/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Meredith Bach, and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
