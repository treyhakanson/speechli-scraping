COLE\n\n\n    _A strong man can, of course, be dangerous, but he doesn't\n    approach the vicious deadliness of a weakling--with a weapon!_\n\n\nIllustrated by van Dongen\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\nNaran Makun looked across the table at the caravan master.\n\n\"And you couldn't find a trace of him?\"\n\n\"Nothing. Not even a scrap of his cargo or so much as the bones of a\nlong-neck. He just dropped out of sight of his whole train. He went\nthrough this big estate, you see. Then he cut back to pick up some of\nhis stops on the northern swing. Well, that was all. He didn't get to\nthe first one.\" The other waved a hand.\n\n\"Weird situation, too. Oh, the null was swirling, we know that, and he\ncould have been caught in an arm. It happens, but it isn't too often\nthat an experienced man like your brother gets in so deep he can't get\nout somehow--or at least leave some trace of what happened.\" The man\npicked up his cup, eying it thoughtfully.\n\n\"Oh, we've all had close ones, sure. We've all lost a long-neck or so,\nnow and then. Whenever the null swirls, it can cover big territory in a\nbig hurry and most of that northern swing is null area at one time or\nanother. One of those arms can overrun a train at night and if a man\nloses his head, he's in big trouble.\" He sipped from his cup.\n\n\"Young caravan master got caught that way, just a while back. A friend\nof mine, Dr. Zalbon, was running the swing after the null retracted. He\nfound what was left.\"\n\n\"Told me he ran into a herd of carnivores. Fifteen or twenty real big\nfellows. Jaws as long as a man. He killed them off and then found they'd\nbeen feeding on what was left of Dar Konil's train.\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"It's not a nice area.\"\n\n\"Hold everything.\" Naran leaned forward. \"You said my brother went\nthrough this big estate. Anyone see him come out?\"\n\nDar Girdek smiled. \"Oh, sure. The Master of the Estates, Kio Barra,\nhimself. He saw him to the border and watched him go on his way.\"\n\nNaran looked doubtful. \"And what kind of a character is this Barra?\"\n\n\"Oh, him!\" Dar Girdek waved a hand. \"Nothing there. In the first place,\nhe holds one of the biggest estates in the mountain area. So what would\nhe want to rob a freight caravan for?\" He laughed.\n\n\"In the second place, the guy's practically harmless. Oh, sure, he's got\na title. He's Lord of the Mountain Lake. And he wears a lot of psionic\ncrystalware. But he's got about enough punch to knock over some\nvarmint--if it's not too tough. Dar Makun might be your weak brother,\nbut he'd have eaten that guy for breakfast if he'd tried to be rough.\"\n\n\"Psionic weakling, you mean? But how does he manage to be a master\nProtector of an Estate?\"\n\nDar Girdek smiled wryly. \"Father died. Brother sneaked off somewhere.\nThat left him. Title's too clear for anyone to try any funny business.\"\n\n\"I see.\" Naran leaned back. \"Now, what about this null?\"\n\n\"Well, of course you know about the time the pseudomen from the Fifth\nmanaged to sneak in and lay a mess of their destructors on Carnol?\"\n\n\"I might. I was one of the guys that saw to it they didn't get back to\ncelebrate.\" Naran closed his eyes for an instant.\n\n\"Yeah. Way I heard it, you were the guy that wrapped 'em up. Too bad\nthey didn't get you on the job sooner. Maybe we wouldn't have this mess\non our hands now.\" Dar Girdek shrugged.\n\n\"Anyway, they vaporized the city and a lot of area around it. That was\nbad, but the aftereffect is worse. We've got scholars beating their\nbrains cells together, but all they can tell us is that there's a big\narea up there just as psionically dead as an experimental chamber.\" He\ngrinned.\n\n\"I could tell 'em that much myself. It's a sort of cloud. Goes\nturbulent, shoots out arms, then folds in again.\n\n\"We'd by-pass the whole thing, but it's right on the main trade route.\nOnly way around it is plenty of days out of the path, clear down around\nthe middle sea and into the lake region. Then you have to go all the way\nback anyway, if you plan to do any mid-continent trading. And you still\ntake a chance of getting caught in a swirl arm.\"\n\nNaran tilted his head. \"So? Suppose you do get into a swirl? All you\nneed to do is wait.\" He smiled.\n\n\"You know. Just sort of ignore it. It'll go away.\"\n\n\"Uh huh. Sounds easy enough. It's about what we do when we have to. But\nthere are things living there. They can be hard to ignore.\"\n\n\"You mean the carnivores?\"\n\n\"That's right. If you meet one of those fellow out in normal territory,\nhe's no trouble at all. You hit him with a distorter and he flops. Then\nyou figure out whether to reduce him to slime or leave the carcass for\nhis friends and relations.\" He smiled.\n\n\"From what your brother said, you wouldn't need the distorter.\"\n\nNaran smiled deprecatingly. \"That's one of the things they pay me for,\"\nhe remarked. \"We run into some pretty nasty beasties at sea.\"\n\n\"Yeah. I've heard. Big, rough fellows. Our varmints are smaller. But\nwhat would you do if you ran into twenty tons or so of pure murder, and\nyou with no more psionic power than some pseudoman?\"\n\nNaran looked at him thoughtfully. \"I hadn't thought of that,\" he\nadmitted. \"I might not like it. Jaws as longs as a man, you said?\"\n\nThe other nodded. \"Longer, sometimes. And teeth as long as your hand.\nOne snap and there's nothing left.\n\n\"When they kill a long-neck, they have a good meal and walk away from\nwhatever's left. But people are something else. They just can't get\nenough and they don't leave any crumbs.\" He waved a hand.\n\n\"There've been several trains caught by those things. A swirl arm comes\nover at night, you see, and the caravan master loses his head. He can't\nthink of anything but getting out. Oh, he can yell at his drivers.\nThey've got a language, and we all know it. That's easy. But did you\never try to get a long-neck going without psionic control?\"\n\n\"I see what you mean. It could be a little rough.\"\n\n\"Yeah. It could be. Anyway, about this time, everybody's yelling at\neverybody else. The long-necks are squealing and bellowing. Drivers are\njerking on reins. And a herd of carnivores hears the commotion. So, they\ndrop around to see the fun. See what I mean?\"\n\nNaran nodded and Dar Girdek went on.\n\n\"Well, that's about it. Once in a great while, some guy manages to get\ninto a cave and hide out till the null swings away and another caravan\ncomes along. But usually, no one sees anything but a little of the cargo\nand some remains of long-necks. No one's ever come up with any part of\nman or pseudoman. As I said, one snap and there's nothing left.\"\n\nNaran smiled wryly. \"Tough to be popular, I guess.\" He leaned forward.\n\n\"But you've been over the trail several times since he disappeared. And\nyou said you've seen nothing. No trace of the train. That right?\"\n\nThe other shook his head. \"Not even a cargo sling.\"\n\n\"You're making up a train now, aren't you? I'd like to go along on this\nnext trip. Fact is, I've been thinking some nasty thoughts. And I'm\ngoing to be uneasy till I find out whether I'm right or not.\"\n\nDar Girdek rubbed his chin. \"Want to buy in, maybe?\"\n\n\"No, I don't think so. I'll work my way--as your lead driver.\"\n\n\"Oh, no!\" Dar Girdek laughed. \"You don't put a psionic on some\nlong-neck. Lead driver's pseudoman, just like the rest.\" He sobered.\n\n\"Oh, sure. You could handle the drivers, but it just isn't done.\"\n\nNaran smiled. \"Oh, as far as the other drivers'll know, I'm just another\npseudoman. I've been a ship's non-psi agent, remember? We earn our keep\nby dealing with the people in non-psi areas.\"\n\n\"It won't work.\" The caravan master shook his head. \"These drivers can\nget pretty rough with each other. You'd have to set two or three of them\nback on their heels the first day. It would be either that, or get a lot\nof bruises and end up as camp flunky.\"\n\n\"Could be,\" Naran told him. \"Tell you what. You turn me loose in an\nexperimental chamber so I can't fudge. Then send your toughest driver in\nand tell him to kick me out of there. I'll show him some tricks I\nlearned from the non-psi's overseas and he'll be a smarter man when he\nwakes up.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLeuwan, Kio Barra, Lord of the Mountain Lake, Master of the Estates Kira\nBarra, and Protector of the Common Good, stood examining the assortment\nof crystals in a cabinet. He hesitated over a large, brilliantly\ngleaming sphere of crystallized carbon, then shook his head. That one\nwould be pretty heavy going, he was sure. The high intensity summary\nsaid something about problems of the modern world, so it could be\nexpected to be another of those dull reports on the welfare of the\nCommonwealth.\n\nWhy, he wondered, did some projection maker waste good time and effort\nby making up things like that? And why did they waste more time and\neffort by sending them around? When a man wanted to relax, he wanted\nsomething to relax with. What he was looking for was something light.\n\nHe turned his attention to other crystals, at last selecting a small,\nblue prism. He held it up, regarding it, then nodded and placed it on\nthe slender black pedestal near his chair, where he could observe\nwithout undue effort.\n\nHe turned, examining each corner of his empty study, then took his\nsapphire-tipped golden staff from under his arm, placing it carefully on\na rack built into his chair arm, where it would be convenient to his\nhand should the need arise.\n\nOne could never be too careful, he thought. Of course, he could deal\nwith any recalcitrant slave by other means, but the distorter was\nconvenient and could be depended upon to give any degree of pressure\ndesired. And it was a lot less trouble to use than to concentrate on\nmore fatiguing efforts such as neural pressure or selective paralysis.\n\nOne must conserve one's powers for times when they might be really\nneeded.\n\nToo, there was the remote possibility that some lackland wanderer might\ncome by and find a flaw in the protection of the Estates--even somehow\npenetrate to the Residence. Barra shuddered at that thought, then\nshrugged it off. Kira Barra was well protected, of that he had made\nsure. Ever vigilant surrogates were deposited in all the strategic spots\nof the Estates--not only to allow quick observations of the condition of\nthe lands, but also to give automatic warning of the approach of anyone\nof inimical turn of mind.\n\nHe eased his bulk into the chair, twisted about for a few moments as it\nadjusted to fit his body, then leaned back with a sigh of relaxation and\ndirected his thoughts to the crystal before him.\n\nUnder the impulses of his amplified thought, the crystal glowed,\nappeared to expand, then became a three-dimensional vista.\n\nThe high intensity summary and excerpt leader had been not too\ndeceptive, Barra told himself as the story unfolded. It was a well done\nadventure projection, based on the war with the Fifth planet.\nCritically, he watched the actions of a scout crew, approving of the\nauthor's treatment and selection of material. He, Barra, was something\nof a connoisseur of these adventure crystals, even though he had never\nfound it necessary to leave the protection of Earth's surface.\n\nHe shrugged, taking his attention from the projection.\n\nThe lacklanders, he told himself--entertainment people, caravan masters,\nseafarers, other wanderers of light responsibility--were the natural\nones to be selected to go out and deal with remote emergencies.\n\nLike all stable, responsible men of property and worth, he was far too\nvaluable to the Commonwealth to risk himself in wild dashes to the dead,\nnon-psionic lands, or out into the emptiness of space. As far as risking\nhimself on combat missions of interplanetary war-- He shook his head.\nThis was pure stupidity.\n\nHe frowned uneasily. It had been a bit unfair, though, of the\nControllers. They had completely excused him from service on the basis\nof inaptitude. It had rankled ever since.\n\nOf course he couldn't be expected to dash madly about in some two-man\nscout. Even as his brother's assistant, he had been a person of quite\ndefinite standing and responsibility and such antics would have been\nbeneath his dignity. He had made that quite plain to them.\n\nThere had been responsible posts where a man of his quality and standing\ncould have been of positive value. And, as he had pointed out, they\ncould have assigned him to one of those.\n\nBut no! They had merely excused him. Inapt!\n\nAs far as that went, he told himself angrily, he, Kio Barra, could\ncomport himself with the best if necessity demanded.\n\nThose dashing characters in this projection were, of course, the\nfigments of some unstable dreamer's imagination. But they showed the\ninstability of the usual lackland wanderers. And what could such men do\nthat a solid, responsible man like himself couldn't do better?\n\nHe returned to the crystal, then shook his head in disgust. It had\nbecome full--flat--meaningless. Besides, he had matters of real import\nto take care.\n\nHe directed his attention to the chair, which obediently swung about\nuntil he faced his large view crystal.\n\n\"Might as well have a look at the East Shore,\" he told himself.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs he focused his attention, the crystal expanded, then became a huge\nwindow through which he could see the shores of the inland sea, then the\nlands to the east of the large island on which he had caused his\nResidence to be built. He looked approvingly at the rolling, tree-clad\nhills as the view progressed.\n\nSuddenly, he frowned in annoyance. The great northern null was in\nturbulence again, thrusting its shapeless arms down toward the borders\nof Kira Barra. He growled softly.\n\nThere, he told himself, was the result of the carelessness of those\nlackland fools who had been entrusted with the defense of the home\nplanet. Their loose, poorly planned defenses had allowed the pseudomen\nof the Fifth to dash in and drop their destructors in a good many spots\non the surface. And here was one of them.\n\nHere was a huge area which had once been the site of a great city and\nwhich had contained the prosperous and productive estates of a Master\nProtector, now reduced to a mere wasteland into which slaves might\nescape, to lead a brute-like existence in idleness.\n\nHe had lost pseudomen slaves in this very null and he knew he would\nprobably lose more. Despite the vigilance of the surrogates, they kept\nslipping across the river and disappearing into that swirling\nnothingness. And now, with that prominence so close--\n\nHe had no guards he could trust to go after the fellows, either. Such\nherd guards as he had would decide to desert their protector and take up\nthe idle life which their fellow pseudomen had adopted. A few of them\nhad gone out and done just that. Their memories of the protection and\nprivileges granted them were short and undependable. He sighed.\n\n\"Ungrateful beasts!\"\n\nSome Master Protectors had little trouble along that line. Others had\nmanaged to hire the services of halfmen--weak psionics, too weak to\ngovern and yet strong and able enough to be more than mere pseudomen.\n\nThese halfmen made superb, loyal guards and overseers--for some--but\nnone had remained at Kira Barra. They had come, to be sure, but they had\nstayed on for a time, then drifted away.\n\nAnd, he thought angrily, it was illegal to restrain these halfmen in\nany way. Some soft-headed fool had granted their kind the rights of\nCommonwealth citizenship. Halfmen had even managed to take service with\nthe fleet during the war with the Fifth Planet. Some of them had even\nmanaged somehow to be of small value--and now many of them held the\nstatus of veterans of that victorious war--a status he, one of the great\nlandholders, was denied.\n\nNo, he told himself, until such time as the nulls were solved and\neliminated, such pseudomen as managed to cross the northeastern river\nwere safe enough in their unknown land. And, he thought sourly, the\nscholars had made no progress in their studies of the nulls.\n\nProbably they were concerning themselves with studies more likely to\ngive them preferment or more immediate personal gain.\n\nOf course, the wasteland wasn't entirely unknown, not to him, at least.\nHe had viewed the area personally. There were hilltops on the Estates\nfrom which ordinary eyesight would penetrate far into the dead area,\neven though the more powerful and accurate parasight was stopped at its\nborders. Yes, he had seen the affected area.\n\nHe had noted that much of it had regained a measure of fertility. There\nwas life now--some of it his own meat lizards who had wandered across\nthe river and out of his control. And he had even seen some of the\nescaped pseudomen slinking through the scrub growth and making their\ncrudely primitive camps.\n\n\"Savages!\" he told himself. \"Mere animals. And one can't do a thing\nabout them, so long as they let that dead area persist.\"\n\nEventually, the scholars had reported, the dead areas would diminish and\nfade from existence. He smiled bitterly. Here was a nice evasion--a neat\nexcuse for avoiding study and possible, dangerous research.\n\nSo long as those nulls remained, they would be sources of constant loss\nof the responsible Master Protectors, and would thus threaten the very\nfoundations of the Commonwealth.\n\nPossibly, he should-- He shook his head.\n\nNo, he thought, this was impractical. Parasight was worthless beyond the\nborders of the null. No surrogate could penetrate it and no weapon would\noperate within it. It would be most unsafe for any true man to enter.\nThere, one would be subject to gross, physical attack and unable to make\nproper defense against it.\n\nCertainly, the northern null was no place for him to go. Only the\npseudomen could possibly tolerate the conditions to be found there, and\nthus, there they had found haven and were temporarily supreme.\n\nBesides, this matter was the responsibility of the Council of\nControllers and the scholars they paid so highly.\n\nHe concentrated on the crystal, shifting the view to scan toward the\nnearest village.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSuddenly, he sat forward in his chair. A herd of saurians was slowly\ndrifting toward one of the arms the null had thrust out. Shortly, they\nwould have ambled into a stream and beyond, out of all possible control.\nPerhaps they might wander for years in the wastelands. Perhaps they and\ntheir increase might furnish meat for the pseudomen who lurked inside\nthe swirling blankness.\n\nHe snarled to himself. No herders were in sight. No guard was in\nattendance. He would have to attend to this matter himself. He\nconcentrated his attention on the power crystals of a distant surrogate,\nwilling his entire ego into the controls.\n\nAt last, the herd leader's head came up. Then the long-neck curved,\nsnaking around until the huge beast stared directly at the heap of rocks\nwhich housed the crystals of the surrogate himself. The slow drift of\nthe herd slowed even more, then stopped as the other brutes dimly\nrecognized that something had changed. More of the ridiculously tiny\nheads swiveled toward the surrogate.\n\nKio Barra squirmed in his chair. Holding these empty minds was a chore\nhe had always hated.\n\nCertainly, there was less total effort than that required for the\ncontrol of the more highly organized pseudomen, but the more complex\nminds reacted with some speed and the effort was soon over. There was a\nshort, sometimes sharp struggle, then surrender.\n\nBut this was long-term, dragging toil--a steady pushing at a soggy,\nunresisting, yet heavy mass. And full concentration was imperative if\nanything was to be accomplished. The reptilian minds were as unstable\nas they were empty and would slip away unless firmly held. He stared\nmotionlessly at his crystal, willing the huge reptiles to turn--to\nwaddle back to the safe grasslands of the estate, far from the null.\n\nAt last, the herd was again in motion. One by one, the huge brutes swung\nabout and galloped clumsily toward more usual pastures, their long necks\nswaying loosely with their motion.\n\nSwitching from surrogate to surrogate, Barra followed them, urged them,\nforced them along until they plunged into the wide swamp northeast of\nTibara village.\n\nHe signed wearily and shifted his viewpoint to a surrogate which\noverlooked the village itself. What, he wondered, had happened to the\nherdsmen--and to the guards who should be overseeing the day's work?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHalf hidden among ferns and the mastlike stems of trees, the rude huts\nof Tibara nestled in the forest, blending with their surroundings, until\nonly the knowing observer could identify them by vague form. Barra\nshifted his viewpoint to the central village surrogate.\n\nThere were other open spaces in the village, but this was the largest.\nHere was the village well, near which a few children played some\nincomprehensible game. An old man had collected a pile of rock and had\nstarted work on the well curb. Now, he sat near his work, leaning\nagainst the partly torn down wall. Spots of sunlight, coming through\nthe fronds high above, struck his body, leaving his face in shadow. He\ndozed in the warmth, occasionally allowing his eyes to half open as he\nidly regarded the scene before him.\n\nBefore some of the huts surrounding the rude plaza, women squatted on\nthe ground, their arms swinging monotonously up and down as they struck\ntheir wooden pestles into bowls of grain which they were grinding to\nmake the coarse meal which was their mainstay of diet.\n\nA few men could be seen, scratching at small garden plots or idly\nrepairing tools. Others squatted near their huts, their attention\noccupied by fishing gear. Still others merely leaned against convenient\ntrees, looking at each other, their mouths moving in the grotesque way\nof the pseudoman when he could find an excuse to idle away time.\n\nBarra listened to the meaningless chatter of grunts and hisses, then\ndisregarded the sounds. They formed, he had been told, a sort of\nelementary code of communication. He coughed disparagingly. Only some\nsubhuman could bring himself to study such things.\n\nOf course, he knew that some lacklanders could make vocal converse with\nthe pseudomen and caravan masters seemed to do it as a regular thing,\nbut he could see no point in such effort. He could make his demands\nknown without lowering himself by making idiotic noises.\n\nHis communicator crystals would drive simple thoughts into even the\nthick skulls of his slaves. And he could--and did--thus get obedience\nand performance from those slaves by using normal, sensible means as\nbefitted one of the race of true men.\n\nAnd what would one want of the pseudomen other than obedience? Would one\nperhaps wish to discuss matters of abstract interest with these beast\nmen? He regarded the scene with growing irritation.\n\nNow, he remembered. It was one of those days of rest which some idiot in\nthe Council had once sponsored. And a group of soft-headed fools had\nconcurred, so that one now had to tolerate periodic days of idleness.\n\nTimes had changed, he thought. There had been a time when slaves were\nslaves and a man could expect to get work from them in return for his\nprotection and support.\n\nBut even with these new, soft laws, herds must be guarded--especially\nwith that null expanding as it was. Even some lackland idiot should be\nable to understand that much.\n\nHe turned his attention to the headman's hut.\n\nThe man was there. Surrounded by a few villagers, he squatted before his\nflimsy, frond-roofed hut, his mouth in grotesque motion. Now, he stopped\nhis noisemaking and poised his head. Then he nodded, looking about the\nvillage.\n\nObviously, he was taking his ease and allowing his people to do as they\nwould, without supervision.\n\nBarra started to concentrate on the surrogate, to make his wishes and\nhis displeasure known. Then he turned impatiently from the crystal,\nseizing his staff. Efficient as the surrogates were, there were some\nthings better attended to in person.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe got to his feet and strode angrily out of the study, sending a\nperemptory summons before him. As he entered the wide hallway, an\nelderly slave came toward him. Barra looked at the man imperiously.\n\n\"My cloak,\" he demanded, \"and the cap of power.\"\n\nHe projected the image of his fiber cloak and of the heavy gold\nheadpiece with its precisely positioned crystals, being careful to note\nthe red, green and blue glow of the various jewels. Meticulously, he\nfilled in details of the gracefully formed filigree which formed mounts\nto support the glowing spheres. And he indicated the padded headpiece\nwith its incrustation of crystal carbon, so his servitor could make no\nmistake. The man was more sensitive than one of the village slaves, but\neven so, he was merely a pseudoman and had to have things carefully\ndelineated for him.\n\nAs the man walked toward a closet, Barra looked after him unhappily. The\nheavy power and control circlet was unnecessary in the Residence, for\namplifiers installed in the building took care of all requirements. But\noutside, in the village and fields, a portable source of power and\ncontrol was indispensable and this heavy gold cap was the best device he\nhad been able to find.\n\nEven so, he hated to wear the circlet. The massive crystals mounted on\ntheir supporting points weighed a couple of pounds by themselves and\nthough the gold insulating supports were designed as finely as possible,\nthe metal was still massive and heavy. It was a definite strain on his\nneck muscles to wear the thing and he always got a headache from it.\n\nFor an instant, envy of the powerful psionics crossed his mind. There\nwere, he knew, those who required no control or power devices, being\nable to govern and direct psionic forces without aid. But his powers,\nthough effective as any, required amplification and when he went out of\nthe Residence it was essential that he have the cap with him.\n\nProper and forceful handling of the things of the Estates, both animate\nand inanimate, demanded considerable psionic power and this made the\nlarge red power crystal at the center of his cap most necessary.\n\nBesides, simultaneous control problems could be difficult--sometimes\neven almost impossible--without the co-ordinating crystals which were\ninset at the periphery of the headband.\n\nAnd there was the possibility that he might meet some trespassing\nlacklander who might have to be impressed with the resources of the\nmaster of Kira Barra. He knew of more than one instance wherein a Master\nProtector had been overcome by some predatory lackland wanderer, who had\nthen managed by one means or another to secure his own accession to the\nestates of his victim. He smiled grimly.\n\nCarelessness could be costly. He had proved that to his brother.\n\nKio Barra still remembered the first time he had quarreled violently\nwith Boemar. He still remembered the gentle, sympathetic smile and the\nsudden, twisting agony that had shot through him as his power crystal\noverloaded. The flare of energy had left him incapable of so much as\nreceiving a strongly driven thought for many days.\n\nHe laughed. But, poor, soft fool that he had been, Boemar had carefully\nnursed his brother's mind back to strength again.\n\nYes, Boemar had been a powerful man, but a very unwise one. And he had\nforgotten the one great strength of his weaker brother--a strength that\nhad grown as Leuwan aged. And so, it was Leuwan who was Kio Barra.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nBut such a thing would never again happen at Kira Barra. With his\ncontrols and amplifiers, he was more than a match for the most powerful\nof the great psionics--so long as they didn't meet him with affectionate\nsympathy.\n\nHe stood silently as the servitor put the cap on his head and placed the\ncloak about his shoulders. Then, tucking his heavy duty distorter under\nhis arm, he turned toward the outer door. The control jewels on his cap\nburned with inner fire as he raised himself a few inches from the floor\nand floated out toward the dock.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNot far from the forest shaded village of Tibara, logs had been lashed\ntogether to form a pier which jutted from the shore and provided a\nmooring for the hollowed logs used by men of the village in harvesting\nthe fish of the lake. Several boats nested here, their bows pointing\ntoward the fender logs of the pier. More were drawn up on the gravel of\nthe shore, where they lay, bottoms upward, that they might dry and be\ncleaned.\n\nA few villagers squatted by their boats and near the pier. Others were\nby the nets which had been spread over the gravel to dry.\n\nOne large section of the pier was vacant. Always, this area was reserved\nfor the use of the Lord of the Mountain Lake.\n\nAs Barra's boat sped through the water, he concentrated his attention on\nthe logs of the pier, urging his boat to increasing speed. The sharp\nprow rose high in the water, a long vee of foam extending from it, to\nspread out far behind the racing boat.\n\nAs the bow loomed almost over the floating logs, Barra abruptly\ntransferred his focus of attention to his right rear, pulling with all\nthe power of the boat's drive crystals. The craft swung violently,\nthrowing a solid sheet of water over pier and shore, drenching the logs\nand the men about them.\n\nThen the bow settled and the boat lay dead in the water, less than an\ninch from the pier's fender logs.\n\nBarra studied the space between boat and logs for an instant, then\nnodded in satisfaction. It was an adequate landing by anyone's\nstandards.\n\nHis tension somewhat relieved, he raised himself from the boat and\nhovered over the dock.\n\nSternly, he looked at the villagers who were now on their feet, brushing\nwater from their heads and faces. They ceased their movements, eying\nhim apprehensively and he motioned imperiously toward the boat.\n\n\"Secure it!\"\n\nThe jewels of his control cap glowed briefly, amplifying and radiating\nthe thought.\n\nThe villagers winced, then two of them moved to obey the command. Barra\nturned his attention away and arrowed toward the screen of trees which\npartially concealed the village proper.\n\nAs he dropped to the ground in the clearing before the headman's hut,\nmen and women looked at him, then edged toward their homes. He ignored\nthem, centering his attention on the headman himself.\n\nThe man had gotten to his feet and was anxiously studying his master's\nface.\n\nFor a few seconds, Barra examined the man. He was old. He had been\nheadman of the village under the old Master Protector, his father--and\nhis brother had seen no reason for change, allowing the aging headman to\nremain in charge of the welfare of his people.\n\nBut this was in the long ago. Both of the older Kio Barra had been soft,\nslack men, seeking no more than average results. He, Leuwan, was\ndifferent--more exacting--more demanding of positive returns from the\nEstates.\n\nOh, to be sure, Kira Barra had somehow prospered under the soft hands of\nhis predecessors, despite their coddling of the subhuman pseudomen, but\nthere had been many laxities which had infuriated Leuwan, even when he\nwas a mere youth. He frowned thoughtfully.\n\nOf course, if those two hadn't been so soft and tolerant, he would have\nbeen something other than Lord of the Mountain Lake. He would have had\nto find other activities elsewhere. He dropped the line of thought.\n\nThis was not taking care of the situation.\n\nHe put his full attention on the man before him, driving a demand with\nfull power of cap amplifier.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Why are all your people idling away their time? Where are your herdsmen\nand guards?\"\n\nThe headman's face tensed with effort. He waved a hand southward and\nmade meaningless noises. Faintly, the thought came through to Barra.\n\n\"In south forest, with herd. Not idle, is rest day. Few work.\"\n\nBarra looked angrily at the man. Did this fool actually think he could\nevade and lie his way out of the trouble his obvious failure to\nsupervise had brought? He jabbed a thumb northward.\n\n\"What about that herd drifting toward the north river?\" The two green\ncommunicator crystals gleamed with cold fire.\n\nThe headman looked confused. \"Not north,\" came the blurred thought. \"No\nherd north. All south forest, near swamp. One-hand boys watch. Some\nguard. Is rest day.\"\n\nUnbelievingly Barra stared at the pseudoman. He was actually persisting\nin his effort to lie away his failure. Or was he attempting some sort\nof defiance? Had his father and brother tolerated such things as this,\nor was this something new, stemming from the man's age? Or, perhaps, he\nwas trying the temper of the Master Protector, to see how far he could\ngo in encroaching on authority.\n\nHe would deal with this--and now!\n\nAbruptly, he turned away, to direct his attention to the central\nsurrogate. It was equipped with a projector crystal.\n\nThe air in the clearing glowed and a scene formed in the open space.\nUnmistakably, it was the northern part of Kira Barra. The lake was\nshown, and sufficient landmarks to make the location obvious, even to a\npseudoman. Carefully, Barra prevented any trace of the blank, swirling\nnull from intruding on the scene. Perhaps the subhuman creature before\nhim knew something of its properties, but there was no point in making\nthese things too obvious.\n\nHe focused the scene on the stream and brought the approaching herd into\nthe picture, then he flashed in his own face, watching. And he brought\nthe view down closely enough to indicate that no human creature was near\nthe herd. Finally, he turned his attention to the headman again.\n\n\"There was the herd. Where were your people?\"\n\nThe old man shook his head incredulously, then turned toward one of the\nfew men who still remained in the clearing.\n\nHe made a series of noises and the other nodded. There were more of the\ngrowls and hisses, then the headman waved a hand southward and the other\nnodded again and turned away, to run into the trees and disappear.\n\nThe headman faced Barra again.\n\n\"Send man,\" he thought laboriously. \"Be sure herd is still south.\" He\npointed toward the area where the projection had been.\n\n\"That not herd,\" he thought. \"That other herd. Never see before.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBarra scowled furiously.\n\n\"You incapable imbecile! You dare to call your master a liar?\"\n\nHe swung about, his furious gaze scanning the village. The pile of\nstones he had noticed before caught his attention. He focused on it.\n\nA few stones rose into the air and flew toward the headman.\n\nThe old man faced about, his eyes widening in sudden fear. He dodged one\nof the flying stones, then turned to flee.\n\nBarra flicked a second control on him briefly and the flight was halted.\n\nMore stones flew, making thudding sounds as they struck, then sailing\naway, to gain velocity before they curved back, to strike again.\n\nAt last, Barra turned from the litter of rock about the formless mass on\nthe ground. He stared around the village, the fury slowly ebbing within\nhim.\n\nA few faces could be seen, peeping from windows and from between trees.\nHe motioned.\n\n\"All villagers,\" he ordered. \"Here before me. Now!\" He waited\nimpatiently as people reluctantly came from their huts and out of the\ntrees, to approach the clearing.\n\nAt last, the villagers were assembled. Barra looked them over,\nidentifying each as he looked at him. Apart from the others, one of the\nyounger herd guards stood close to his woman. Barra looked at him\nthoughtfully.\n\nThis man, he had noted, was obeyed by both herds and herdsmen. He had\nseen him at work, as he had seen all the villagers, and obviously, the\nman was capable of quick decisions--as quick, that was, as any pseudoman\ncould be. He pointed.\n\n\"This village needs a new headman,\" he thought peremptorily. \"You will\ntake charge of it.\"\n\nThe man looked toward the huddled mass in the center of the litter of\nrocks, then looked back at his woman. A faint wave of reluctance came to\nBarra, who stared sternly.\n\n\"I said you are the new headman,\" he thought imperiously. \"Take charge.\"\nHe waved a hand.\n\n\"And get this mess cleaned up. I want a neat village from now on.\"\n\nAs the man lowered his head submissively, Barra turned away, rose from\nthe ground, and drifted majestically toward the lake shore. He could\ncheck on the progress of the village from his view crystal back at the\nResidence.\n\nThe situation had been taken care of and there was no point in remaining\nin the depressing atmosphere of the village for too long.\n\nBesides, there was that adventure projection he hadn't finished.\nPerhaps it would be of interest now.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs the projection faded, Barra looked around the study, then got out of\nhis chair and picked the crystal from its pedestal. He stood, looking at\nit approvingly for a few seconds, then went over to the cabinet and set\nit back in its case. For a time, he looked at the rest of the\nassortment.\n\nFinally, he shook his head. Some of them, he would sell unscanned. The\nothers--well, they could wait.\n\nYes, he thought, the record crystals had better be left alone for a\nwhile. He hadn't finished his inspection of the Estates and the\nsituation at Tibara might not be an isolated case. It would be well to\nmake a really searching inspection. He sighed.\n\nIn fact, it might be well to make frequent searching inspections.\n\nShortly after his accession to the Estates, he had seen to the defense\nof Kira Barra. He smiled wryly as he thought of the expense he had\nincurred in securing all those power and control crystals to make up his\nsurrogate installations. But they had been well worth it.\n\nHe had been most thorough then, but that had been some time ago. His\nlast full inspection had been almost a year ago. Lately he had been\nsatisfying himself with spot inspections, not really going over the\nEstates from border to border.\n\nOf course, the spot inspections had been calculated to touch the\npotential trouble spots and they had been productive of results, but\nthere might still be hidden things he should know about. This would\nhave to be looked into.\n\nHe turned and went back to his chair, causing it to swivel around and\nface the view crystal.\n\nThere was that matter of Tibara, as far as that went. Possibly it would\nbe well to count that herd and identify the animals positively.\n\nMaybe the pasturage was getting poor and he would have to instruct the\nnew headman to move to better lands. Those strays had looked rather\nthin, now that he thought of it.\n\nMaybe some of the other long-necks had strayed from the main herd and he\nwould have to have the headman send out guards to pick them up and bring\nthem in.\n\nHe concentrated on the viewer, swinging its scan over to the swamp where\nhe had driven that small herd.\n\nThey were still there, wallowing in the shallow water and grazing on the\nlush vegetation. He smiled. It would be several days before their feeble\nminds threw off the impression he had forced on them that this was their\nproper feeding place.\n\nIdly, he examined the beasts, then he leaned forward, studying them more\ncritically. They weren't the heavy, fat producers of meat normal to the\nTibara herd. Something was wrong.\n\nThese were the same general breed as the Tibara long-necks, to be sure,\nbut either their pasturage had been unbelievably bad or they had been\nrecently run--long and hard. They looked almost like draft beasts.\n\nHe frowned. If these were from the Tibara herd, he'd been missing\nsomething for quite a while.\n\nThoughtfully, he caused the scan to shift. As he followed a small river,\nhe noted groups of the huge, greenish gray beasts as they grazed on the\ntender rock ferns. Here and there, he noted herdsmen and chore boys\neither watching or urging the great brutes about with their noisemakers,\nkeeping the herd together. He examined the scene critically, counting\nand evaluating. Finally, he settled back in his chair.\n\nThe herd was all here--even to the chicks. And they were in good shape.\nHe smiled wryly.\n\nThose brutes over in the swamp really didn't belong here, then. They\nmust have drifted into the Estates from the null, and been on their way\nback. The headman-- He shrugged.\n\n\"Oh, well,\" he told himself, \"it was time I got a new headman for\nTibara, anyway. And the discipline there will be tighter from now on.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe started to shift scan again, then sat up. The view was pulsing.\n\nAs he watched, the scan shifted automatically, to pick up the eastern\nborder of the Estates. Stretching across the landscape was a thin line\nof draft saurians, each with its driver straddling its neck. The train\nhad halted and a heavily armored riding lizard advanced toward the\nsurrogate. Its rider was facing the hidden crystals.\n\nAs Barra focused on him, the man nodded.\n\n\"Master Protector?\"\n\n\"That is correct.\" Barra activated his communicators. \"I am Kio Barra,\nMaster of the Estates Kira Barra.\"\n\nThe other smiled. \"I am Dar Makun, independent caravan master,\" he\nannounced. \"The null turbulence forced me off route. Lost a few carriers\nand several days of time. I'd like to request permission to pass over\nyour land. And perhaps you could favor me by selling some long-necks to\nfill my train again. The brutes I've got left are a little overloaded.\"\n\nBarra considered. It was not an unusual request, of course. Certain\ncaravans habitually came through, to do business with the Estates.\nOthers were often detoured by the northern null and forced to come\nthrough Kira Barra.\n\nOf course, the masters of the caravans were lacklanders, but they had\ngiven little trouble in the past. And this one seemed to be a little\nabove the average if anything. In his own way, he was a man of\nsubstance, for an owner master was quite different from someone who\nmerely guided another's train for hire.\n\nThe northern null was a menace, Barra thought, but it did have this one\nadvantage. The regular caravans, of course, passed with the courtesy of\nthe Estates, doing business on their way. But these others paid and\ntheir pasturage and passage fees added to the income of the Estates.\n\nIn this case, the sale of a few draft saurians could be quite\nprofitable. He shifted the view crystals to allow two-way vision.\n\n\"To be sure.\" He waved a hand. \"Direct your train due west to the second\nriver. Cross that, then follow it southward. I will meet you at the\nfirst village you come to and we can kennel your slaves there and put\nyour beasts to pasture under my herdsmen. From there, it is a short\ndistance to the Residence.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\" Dar Makun nodded again, then turned and waved an arm.\nFaintly, Barra caught the command to proceed.\n\nHe watched for a few minutes and examined the long train as it moved\nover the rolling land and lumbered into a forest. Then he shifted his\nscan to continue his inspection of the rest of the lands. It would be\nseveral hours before that caravan could reach Tibara and he could scan\nback and note its progress as he wished.\n\nHe relaxed in his chair, watching the panorama as the Estates unrolled\nbefore him. Now and then, he halted the steady motion of the scanner, to\nexamine village or herd closely. Then he nodded in satisfaction and\ncontinued his inspection.\n\nThe Estates, he decided, were in overall good condition. Of course,\nthere were a few corrections he would have to have made in the days to\ncome, but these could be taken care of after the departure of the\ncaravan.\n\nThere was that grain field over in the Zadabar section, for example.\nThat headman would have to be straightened out. He smiled grimly. Maybe\nit would be well to create a vacancy in that village. But that could\nwait for a few days.\n\nHe directed the scan back to the eastern section, tracing the route he\nhad given the caravan master. At last, the long line of saurians came\ninto view and he watched their deceptively awkward gait as the alien\ncrawled through a forest and came out into deep grass.\n\nThey were making far better progress than he had thought they would and\nhe would have to get ready if he planned to be in Tibara when they\narrived.\n\nHe was more careful of his dress than usual. This time, he decided, he'd\nwant quite a few protective devices. One could never be quite sure of\nthese caravan masters.\n\nOf course, so long as they could plainly see the futility of any\ntreacherous move, they were good company and easy people to deal with,\nbut it would be most unwise to give one of them any opening. It just\nmight be he would be the one who was tired of wandering.\n\nHe waited patiently as his slave attached his shield brooches and placed\nhis control cap on his head, then he reached into the casket the man\nheld for him and took out a pair of paralysis rings, slipping one on\neach of his middle fingers. At last, he dismissed the man.\n\nHe floated out of the building and let himself down on the cushions in\nthe rear of his speedboat. Critically, he examined the condition of the\ncraft. His yardboys had cleaned everything up, he noted. The canopy was\ndown, leaving the lines of the boat clean and sharp.\n\nHe turned his attention to the power crystal and the boat drew out of\nits shelter, gained speed, and cut through the water to the distant\nshoreline.\n\nWith only part of his mind concentrated on controlling the boat, Barra\nlooked across the lake. It was broad in expanse, dotted with islands,\nand rich in marine life.\n\nPerhaps he might persuade this Dar Makun to pick up a few loads of dried\nlake fish, both for his own rations and for sale along the way to his\ndestination. Some of the warehouses, he had noted, were well stocked and\nhe'd have to arrange for some shipments soon.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe boat was nearing Tibara pier. He concentrated on setting it in close\nto the dock, then made his way to the eastern edge of the village,\nsummoning the headman as he passed through the village center.\n\nHis timing had been good. The head of the long train was nearly across\nthe wide grassland. For a moment, the thought crossed his mind that he\nmight go out and meet the caravan master. But he discarded it. It would\nbe somewhat undignified for the master of the estate to serve as a mere\ncaravan guide. He stood, waiting.\n\nHe could see Dar Makun sitting between the armor fins of his riding\nlizard. The reptile was one of the heavily armored breed he had\nconsidered raising over in the northwest sector.\n\nThey were, he had been told, normally dryland creatures. Such brutes\nshould thrive over in the flats, where the long-necks did poorly. He\nwould have to consider the acquisition of some breeding stock.\n\nThe caravan master drew his mount to a halt and drifted toward the\ntrees. Barra examined the man closely as he approached.\n\nHe was a tall, slender man, perfectly at ease in his plain trail\nclothing. A few control jewels glinted from his fingers and he wore a\nsmall shield brooch, but there was no heavy equipment. His distorter\nstaff, Barra noted, was a plain rod, tipped by a small jewel.\nServiceable, to be sure, but rather short in range. Barra's lip curled a\ntrifle.\n\nThis man was not of really great substance, he decided. He probably had\nhis entire wealth tied up in this one caravan and depended on his fees\nand on the sale of some few goods of his own to meet expenses.\n\nAs Dar Makun dropped to the ground near him, Barra nodded.\n\n\"I have instructed my headman to attend to your drivers and beasts,\" he\nsaid. \"You have personal baggage?\"\n\nThe other smiled. \"Thank you. I'll have one of the boys bring my pack\nwhile the drivers pull up and unload. We can make our stack here, if you\ndon't mind.\"\n\nAs Barra nodded in agreement, Dar Makun turned, waving. He drew a deep\nbreath and shouted loudly, the sounds resembling those which Barra had\noften heard from his slaves. The Master Protector felt a twinge of\ndisgust.\n\nOf course, several of the caravan masters who did regular business at\nKira Barra shouted at their slaves at times. But somehow, he had never\nbecome used to it. He much preferred to do business with those few who\nhandled their pseudomen as they did their draft beasts--quietly, and\nwith the dignity befitting the true race.\n\nHe waited till Dar Makun had finished with his growls and hisses. One of\nthe caravan drivers had swung down and was bringing a fiber cloth bundle\ntoward them. Barra looked at it in annoyance.\n\n\"This,\" he asked himself, \"is his baggage?\" He recovered his poise and\nturned to Dar Makun.\n\n\"He can put it in the boat,\" he told the man. \"I'll have one of my\npeople pick it up for you when we get to the island. Now, if you'll\nfollow me, the pier is over this way.\" He turned and floated toward the\ndock.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs they pulled out into the lake, Dar Makun settled himself in the\ncushions.\n\n\"I never realized what a big lake this is,\" he remarked. \"I've always\nmade the northern swing through this part of the continent. Oh, I've\nseen the lake region from the hills, of course, but--\" He looked at the\nwater thoughtfully.\n\n\"You have quite a lot of fresh-water fish in there?\"\n\nBarra nodded. \"We get a harvest.\"\n\nDar Makun closed his eyes, then opened them again. \"I might deal with\nyou for some of those,\" he commented. \"People out west seem to like\nfresh-water stuff.\" He looked at Barra closely.\n\n\"I'll have to open my cargo for you,\" he went on. \"Might be a few items\nyou'd be interested in.\"\n\nBarra nodded. \"It's possible,\" he said. \"I always need something around\nthe place.\" He speeded the boat a little.\n\nThe boat came to the dock and Barra guided his guest into the Residence\nand on into the study, where he activated the view crystal.\n\n\"There's still light enough for you to get a look at some of the herds,\"\nhe told Dar Makun. \"I believe you said you might need some more draft\nbeasts.\"\n\nMakun watched as the hills of Kira Barra spread out in the air before\nhim.\n\n\"It's a good way to locate the herds and make a few rough notes,\" he\nadmitted. \"Of course, I'll have to get close to the brutes in order to\nreally choose, though.\"\n\n\"Oh?\"\n\n\"Fact. You see, these big lizards aren't all alike. Some of 'em are\nreally good. Some of 'em just don't handle. A few of 'em just lie down\nwhen you drop the first sling on 'em.\" Makun nodded toward the\nprojection.\n\n\"That big fellow over there, for instance,\" he went on. \"Of course, he\nmight slim down and make a good carrier. But usually, if they look like\na big pile of meat, that's all they're good for. A lot of 'em can't even\nstand the weight of a man on their necks. Breaks 'em right down.\"\n\n\"A good carrier can handle a dozen tons without too much trouble, but\nsome of these things have it tough to handle their own weight on dry\nland and you have to look 'em over pretty closely to be sure which is\nwhich. Can't really judge by a projection.\"\n\nBarra looked at the man with slightly increased respect. At least, he\nknew something about his business. He shifted the viewer to the swamp.\n\nOf course, he thought, there were draft animals over in the western\nsector. But this small herd was convenient.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"I've got this little herd over here. They got away\nsome time ago and lost a lot of weight before I rounded them up again.\"\n\nMakun examined the projection with increased interest.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Yeah,\" he remarked. \"I'd like to get out there in the morning and look\nthose fellows over. I just might get the five I need right out there.\nMight even pick up a spare or two.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe swamp was a backwater of the lake, accessible by a narrow channel.\nBarra slowed the boat, easing it along through the still water. Here,\nthe channel was clear, he knew, and it would soon widen. But there were\nsome gravel bars a little farther along that could be troublesome if one\nwere careless. And his attention was divided. He glanced at his\ncompanion.\n\nMakun leaned against the cushions, looking at the thick foliage far\noverhead. Then he turned his attention to the banks of the channel. A\nlong, greenish shape was sliding out of the water. He pointed.\n\n\"Have many of those around here?\"\n\n\"Those vermin?\" Barra looked at the amphibian. \"Not too many, but I\ncould do with less of them.\"\n\nHe picked up his distorter from the rack beside him and pointed it ahead\nof the boat. The sapphire glowed.\n\nThere was a sudden, violent thrashing in the foliage on the bank. The\nslender creature reared into the air, tooth-studded jaws gaping wide.\n\nIt rose above the foliage, emitting a hissing bellow. Then it curled\ninto a ball and hung suspended in the air for an instant before it\ndropped back into the shrubbery with a wet plop.\n\nBarra put the jewel-tipped rod back in its hanger.\n\n\"I don't like those nuisances,\" he explained. \"They can kill a slave if\nhe gets careless. And they annoy the stock.\" He tilted his head forward.\n\n\"There's the herd,\" he went on, \"at the other end of this open water.\nI'll run up close and you can look them over if you wish.\"\n\nMakun looked around, then shrugged. \"Not necessary. I'll go ahead from\nhere. Won't take me too long.\"\n\nHe lifted himself into the air and darted toward one of the huge\nsaurians. Barra watched as he slowed and drifted close to the brute's\nhead, then hovered.\n\nA faint impression of satisfaction radiated from his mind as he drifted\nalong the length of the creature. He went to another, then to another.\n\nAt last, he returned to the boat.\n\n\"Funny thing,\" he commented. \"A couple of my own carriers seem to have\nwandered clear through that null and mixed with your herd.\" He smiled.\n\n\"Stroke of luck. Too bad the rest didn't manage to stay with 'em, but\nyou can't have everything. I'll pay you trespass fees on those two, of\ncourse, then I'd like to bargain with you for about four more to go with\n'em. Got them all picked out and I can cut 'em out and drive them over\nto the train soon's we settle the arrangements.\"\n\nBarra frowned.\n\n\"Now, wait a minute,\" he protested. \"Of course, I'll bargain with you\nfor any or all of this herd. But I'm in the breeding and raising\nbusiness, remember. I certainly can't give away a couple of perfectly\ngood beasts on someone's simple say-so. I'd like a little proof that\nthose two belong to your train before I just hand them over.\"\n\n\"Well, now, if it comes to that, I could prove ownership. Legally, too.\nAfter all, I've worked those critters quite a while and any competent\npsionic could--\" Makun looked at Barra thoughtfully.\n\n\"You know, I'm not just sure I like having my word questioned this way.\nI'm not sure I like this whole rig-out. Seems to me there's a little\nexplaining in order about now--and kind of an apology, too. Then maybe\nwe can go ahead and talk business.\"\n\n\"I don't see any need for me to explain anything. And I certainly don't\nintend to make a apology of any kind. Not to you. I merely made a\nreasonable request. After all, these brutes are on my land and in my\nherd. I can find no mark of identification on them, of any kind.\" Barra\nshrugged.\n\n\"As a matter of fact, I don't even know yet which two you are trying to\nclaim. All I ask is indication of which ones you say are yours and some\nreasonable proof that they actually came from your train. Certainly, a\nmere claim of recognition is ... well, you'll have to admit, it's a\nlittle thin.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMakun looked at him angrily.\n\n\"Now, you pay attention to me. And pay attention good. I'm not stupid\nand I'm not blind. I can see all those jewels you're loaded down with\nand I know why you're wearing them. They tell me a lot about you, you\ncan be sure of that. Don't think I haven't noticed that patronizing air\nof yours, and don't think I've liked it. I haven't and I don't.\n\n\"I know you're scared. I know you're worried to death for fear I'm going\nto pull something on you. I spotted that the first time I talked to\nyou.\" He paused.\n\n\"Oh, I've been trying to ignore it and be decent, but I've had about\nenough. I've been in this caravan business for a long time. I've dealt\nsquare and I'm used to square dealing. Now, you've been putting out a\nlot of side thoughts about thievery and I don't appreciate being treated\nlike some sneak thief. I'm not about to get used to the idea, either.\n\n\"Now, you'd better get the air cleared around here and then we can talk\nbusiness. Otherwise, there's going to be a lot of trouble.\"\n\nBarra felt a surge of fury rising above his fear. This lacklander clown\nactually dared to try to establish domination over a member of the\nruling class? He breathed deeply.\n\n\"I don't have--\"\n\n\"All right, listen to me, you termite. You've come way too far out of\nyour hole. Now, you just better crawl back in there fast, before I turn\non the lights and burn your hide off.\"\n\nThe surge of mental power blazing at Barra was almost a physical force.\nHe cringed away from it, his face wrinkling in an agony of fright. Makun\nlooked at him contemptuously.\n\n\"All right. Now, I'll tell you--\"\n\nSmoothly, Barra's hand went to the haft of his distorter. The jewel\nseemed to rise of its own accord as it blazed coldly.\n\nFor an infinitesimal time, Makun's face reflected horrified\ncomprehension before it melted into shapelessness.\n\nBarra put the distorter back in its rack, looking disgustedly at the\nmess on the cushions. There was nothing for it, he thought. He'd have to\ndestroy those, too. Cleaning was out of the question. He shook his head.\n\nLike all these strong types, this Makun had neglected a simple\nprinciple. With fear as his constant companion, Barra had been forced to\nlearn to live with it.\n\nExtreme mental pressure was merely another form of fright. It could\nparalyze a braver soul--and often did. It merely made Barra miserably\nuncomfortable without disturbing his control. And the hatred that was\nalways in him was unimpaired--even amplified by the pounding terror.\n\nThe more thoroughly Barra was frightened, the more effectively he\nattacked.\n\nHe leaned back in his seat, letting the drumming of his heart subside.\nEventually, he would recover enough to guide the boat out of the swamp\nand back to the Residence.\n\nTomorrow? Well, he would have to inventory the freight the man had\ncarried. He would have to check those draft beasts. Perhaps he could\ndiscern the hidden identification Makun had mentioned.\n\nAnd he would have to make disposition of some twenty slaves. He summoned\nup a smile.\n\nNow that he thought of it, this affair could be turned to profit. After\nall, Dar Makun had been diverted from his route and he had lost some of\nhis train. And caravans had been known to disappear in the vicinity of\nturbulent nulls.\n\nAll he had to do was deny knowledge of the fate of Dar Makun's caravan\nif there were any inquiry. Oh, certainly, he could tell any inquirer,\nDar Makun had arrived. He had stayed overnight and then taken his\ndeparture, saying something about cutting around the null and back to\nhis normal, northern swing.\n\nHe was feeling better now. He turned his attention to the control\ncrystal and the boat swung about, to make its way back toward the lake.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt took longer than he had thought it would. It was evening of the day\nafter the death of Dar Makun when Barra turned in his seat and raised\nhis hand, then waved it in a wide circle.\n\nA quickly directed thought halted his mount and he looked about once\nmore, at the thick forest.\n\nThis clearing was as close to the village of Celdalo as he wanted to\ncome. The villagers never came into this heavy screen of trees, but\nbeyond the forest, there might be some who would watch and wonder. He\nsmiled grimly.\n\nOf course, it didn't make too much difference what slaves might\nthink--if they could think at all, but there was no reason to leave\nunnecessary traces of the day's work.\n\nHe swung about in his cushions and looked back at the line of draft\nbeasts. They were swinging out of line now, to form a semicircle, facing\nthe trees ahead.\n\nHe impressed an order on his mount to stand, then lifted himself out of\nthe cushioned seat between the armor fins. For a few seconds, he\nhovered, looking down at the beast he had been riding.\n\nYes, he thought, he would do well to raise a few of these creatures.\nThey were tractable and comfortable to ride. A good many caravan masters\nmight be persuaded to get rid of their less comfortable mounts in\nexchange for one of these, once they had tried a day's march.\n\nOne by one, the big saurians came to the forest edge and entered the\nclearing, then crouched, to let their drivers swing to the ground. Barra\nlooked at the lead driver.\n\n\"Make your cargo stack over here,\" he ordered, \"at this side of the\nclearing. You will wait here for your master.\"\n\nThe man looked confused. A vague, questioning thought came from him. It\nwasn't really a coherent thought, but just an impression of\ndoubt--uncertainty. Barra frowned impatiently.\n\nIt had been much the same when he had ordered this man to load up back\nat Tibara. Perhaps it was no wonder Dar Makun had been forced to learn\nvocalization if this was the best slave he could find to develop into\nhis headman.\n\nCarefully, he formed a projection. It showed the carriers gathering in\ntheir unloading circles. He made one of the projections turn and drop\nits head over another's back. The wide mouth opened and stubby, peg\nteeth gripped the handling loop of a cargo sling. Then the long-neck\nswiveled back, to repeat the performance.\n\nBarra watched as the man before him nodded in obedient understanding. He\nshot out a sharp, peremptory order.\n\n\"Do it, then! Do it as shown.\"\n\nThe man made noises, then turned, shouting at the other drivers.\n\nBarra watched as the stack of cargo grew. At last, the final sling was\npositioned and a heavy cloth cover was dropped over the great piles.\nBarra looked at the headman.\n\n\"Bring your drivers close,\" he ordered. \"I have something for them to\nsee.\"\n\nAgain, there was the moment of confusion, but this time the man had\ngathered the main sense of the command. He turned again, shouting.\n\nThe drivers looked at each other questioningly, then moved slowly\nforward, to form a tight group before Barra, who watched until they were\nin satisfactory position.\n\nHe concentrated on the group for a few seconds, starting the formation\nof a projection to his left.\n\nAs the air glowed and started to show form, the eyes of the drivers\nswung toward it. Barra smiled tightly and swung his distorter up. The\ncrystal flamed as he swept it across the group of slaves.\n\nHe kept the power on, sweeping the distorter back and forth until all\nthat remained was a large pool of slime which thinned, then oozed into\nthe humus. At last, he tucked the rod back under his arm and examined\nthe scene.\n\nThere was the pile of goods. There were the carrier beasts. But no man\nor pseudoman remained of the caravan. His smile broadened.\n\nOnce he had sorted this cargo and moved it to the Residence and to\nvarious warehouses about the Estates, all traces of Dar Makun and his\ntrain would be gone.\n\nTo be sure, a few villages would find that their herds had increased,\nbut this was nothing to worry about. He sighed.\n\nIt had been a hard day and it would be a hard night's work. He would\nhave to forget his dignity for the time and do real labor. But this was\nnecessity. And there was plenty of profit in it as well.\n\nSo far as the rest of the world might know, Dar Makun and his caravan\nhad left Kira Barra to cut back to the northern swing. And the turbulent\nnull had swallowed them without trace.\n\nHe turned away. He would have to bring work boats in to the nearby\nbeach. Their surrogates were already attuned and ready, and one of them\nhad been equipped with an auxiliary power crystal. He would need that.\n\nAs the boats arrived at village piers, the various headmen would merely\nfollow instructions as given by the boat's surrogates. He would be done\nwith this operation in a few hours.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe days went on, became weeks, then hands of weeks. Little by little,\nBarra changed his attitude toward caravan masters. Once, he had been\ncautious about dealing with them, allowing only a chosen few to do\nbusiness within his borders.\n\nNow, however, he had found a whole, new source of income. And a new\nsense of power had come to him. Caravans were more than welcome at Kira\nBarra.\n\nHe leaned back on his new chair, enjoying the complete ease with which\nit instantly shaped to fit his body. It was precisely like hovering a\nshort distance above the floor, yet there was no strain of concentration\non some control unit. He allowed himself to relax completely and turned\nhis attention to the viewer crystal.\n\nIt was new, too. The old one of his father's which he had brought to the\nnew Residence had seemed quite inadequate when the Residence was redone.\nThis new viewer had been designed for professional use. It was a full\ntwo feet in diameter and could fill thousands of cubic feet with solid\nprojection.\n\nAnimals, trees, pseudomen, all could be brought before him as though\nphysically present in the study. Too, it was simpler than the old one\nand much more accurate in its control. He sighed.\n\nThe Estates had prospered. Of course, he had been cautious. Many\ncaravans had come to Kira Barra and left again, their masters highly\npleased with the fair dealings of the Estates. Several had returned,\ntime and time again.\n\nThere had been others who had come through during times when the null\nwas in turbulence and it was from these that he had taken his harvest.\nHe had been particular in his choices, making careful evaluation before\ntaking any action.\n\nBy this time, his operation was faultless--a smooth routine which\nadmitted of no error. He smiled as he remembered his fumbling efforts\nwith the first caravan and his halting improvements when he had dealt\nwith the next. What were those fellows' names?\n\nHe shrugged. He could remember that first fellow practically begging him\nto take action and he could remember his own frightened evaluation of\nthe situation after the first step. He had gone over a whole, long line\nof alternative choices, rejecting them one by one until the inevitable,\nideal method of operation had come out. He smiled.\n\nWhen he had finally settled on his general method, it had been elegantly\nsimple. But it had been very nearly perfect. Basically, he was still\nusing the same plan.\n\nNow, of course, it was smoother and even more simplified. There were two\ngeneral routines involved.\n\nMost caravan masters were treated with the greatest of consideration.\nThey were allowed to pass through the Estates with only nominal fees and\ninvited to avail themselves of the courtesy of the Estates at any time\nin the future. If trades with the Estates were involved, the fees were\nwaived, of course. And many of them had returned, bringing goods and\ninformation, as well as taking away the produce of the Estates.\n\nThen, there were those caravans which came during turbulences in the\nnull and which seemed worthwhile to the now practiced eyes of Kio Barra.\nThese were the ones ripe for harvest. Their owners had been offered the\ncourtesy of the Estates--and more.\n\nThey had been taken for sightseeing tours--perhaps of the lake--perhaps\nto see valuable carrier stock which could be had at bargain rates.\n\nThen, in complete privacy, a distorter beam had made neat disposition of\nthem.\n\nTheir goods had been distributed through the various warehouses and\nlater disposed of through the safe channels which Barra had carefully\ncultivated. Their slaves, of course, had been eliminated.\n\nBarra regretted this waste of valuable property, but this way there\ncould be no leak of information and no inquiry could be successful.\n\nThere had been an inquiry at one time, but that had been in the earlier\ndays.\n\nThe inquirer had gone away with no suspicion in his mind. He had\nexamined the null from the hills and had agreed with Kio Barra that it\nwas indeed a menace. He had listened sympathetically to Barra's rueful\ncomments about slaves and stock which had drifted into the null, never\nto be heard from again.\n\nBarra activated the view crystal. It was time for another inspection of\nthe Estates.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe projection formed and Barra was suddenly in a wood, looking across a\nwide field. Grain waved in the breeze and here and there, the\nsilhouettes of both long-neck and fin-back could be seen, half hidden by\ngrass and trees.\n\nThe scanner progressed, crossing the field and continuing to another\nforest, operating on the route impressed on it. Barra relaxed as he\nwatched. As the scan progressed through field, swamp and forest, he\nnodded in satisfaction. The Estates were in far better shape than ever\nbefore.\n\nSuddenly, he halted the scan, looking critically at the scene. He was in\nthe central clearing of Tibara. And the village didn't match with the\nstandards he wanted.\n\nHe looked critically at the huts. They were becoming run-down. It had\nbeen too long since the roof thatches had been replaced. Uprights were\nbending a little here, a trifle out of plumb there.\n\nThere were broken stones again in the well curb and the pile of stone\nbrought for repair wasn't neatly stacked. He frowned.\n\nThis was not the first time he'd had to take a firm hand in Tibara. Of\ncourse, he had replaced headmen in other villages--more than once in\nsome cases. But Tibara was working on its third headman. There was\nsomething really wrong in that village.\n\nTo be sure, Tibara was the village where most caravan slaves were\nquartered. A lodge had been built there for that purpose and it was in\nfrequent use. Naturally, it was maintained by the villagers. But that\nwas even less excuse for shoddiness. This should be the neatest, best\nkept village in all Kira Barra. It wasn't.\n\nThe frown deepened. This time, Tibara was going to be cleaned up, and\nhe'd keep his attention on it. The village would stay clean if the\nvillagers had to spend every second of their time on it when they\nweren't taking care of their herds, their boats, and their guest lodge.\n\nAnd there'd be no slacking in those other areas, either.\n\nHe looked around the clearing. There were, he was forced to admit, no\nidlers about at the moment. The only people he could see were women and\nchildren. And the women were busily occupied.\n\nAgain, he studied the scene. The men would be coming in from their\nfields and from the lake in another hour. He would examine a few other\nvillages, then return his attention to Tibara.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWearily, Retonga, headman of Tibara, pulled himself to a sitting\nposition. He looked over to the other side of the room. Mir was already\non her feet. She smiled at him uncertainly.\n\n\"It's morning,\" she said. \"Rest day, at last.\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Retonga closed his eyes for an instant. It had been bad for her,\ntoo, he knew. He'd probably been pretty hard to live with these past few\ndays. He sighed.\n\n\"Rest day,\" he mused. \"But it means nothing. There's still work. There's\nalways work these days.\" He got to his feet.\n\n\"I wish I were just a herd boy--in some other village.\" He went to the\ndoor and looked out.\n\nSomeone had disturbed the pile of building stones. Children had been\nplaying in the clearing the night before and the earth was scuffed up.\nBits of wood and cloth lay scattered here and there.\n\nHe looked at the houses. Folshan's roof was sagging a trifle, he\nnoticed. And there were a couple of dolls lying outside his door. He\nshook his head and went out into the clearing.\n\nOld Tamiso was squatting by the well. Retonga walked over to him.\n\n\"Your stone pile,\" he said. \"A few of the stones are scattered.\"\n\nThe old man looked over, then shrugged.\n\n\"I just picked this one out,\" he explained. \"When I get it laid, I'll\nhave to get another. I'll straighten the pile when I finish here.\"\n\nRetonga smiled wearily. \"And if the master sees your pile now?\"\n\nTamiso pushed himself to his feet, rubbing his back thoughtfully.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"The master can give great pain, and it seems he is\nalways watching these days.\" He walked over to the stones.\n\nFor a moment, Retonga watched as he rearranged his pile, then he turned,\ntilting his head back.\n\n\"Awaken,\" he shouted. \"For the sun looks down and shall he find us\nasleep?\"\n\nA head poked out of a door.\n\n\"It's a rest day. We'll be at it soon enough, but what's the hurry?\"\n\nRetonga shook his head. \"I know it's rest day. You know it's rest day.\nBut there's one who forgets these things. Remember the other evening?\"\n\nFolshan winced and Retonga pointed.\n\n\"Better get those dolls picked up. And there's that roof of yours. I'll\ngive you a hand with it.\"\n\nFolshan came out of his hut, then looked back.\n\n\"No,\" he said slowly. \"You're headman. Remember how that happened? Let\nthe master catch you helping with the work and we'll need yet another\nheadman.\" He shook his head.\n\n\"This time, it could be me.\" He bent over to pick up the toys his\ndaughter had left.\n\n\"Kina,\" he called, \"tell Chama to keep her toys picked up, or she might\nbe needing a new father.\" He turned again.\n\n\"I'll get Kesonta to help with that roof. It'll be straight in an hour\nor so.\"\n\nRetonga looked after him for a moment, then caught the eyes of a couple\nof the women. He made a sweeping motion toward the earth of the\nclearing, then walked back to his own door.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nHe turned, inspecting each detail of the village.\n\n\"Let's see. Is there anything else for the master to find wrong?\" Again,\nhe examined each house closely.\n\nAt last, he turned away, walking toward a path.\n\n\"He'll probably be looking at the waterfront, too,\" he told himself,\n\"and at the lodge.\"\n\nHe walked slowly along the path, checking the forest floor as he went.\nAs he got to the beach, he looked toward the pier, then winced.\n\nA few hundred yards out in the lake, a high wedge of water was sweeping\ntoward him. At the apex of the vee, he could see the shape of a boat,\nits bow riding high over the water.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" he groaned to himself. \"Trouble again!\" He waited.\n\nAs the wave splashed to the pier, he dashed forward to secure the boat.\nKio Barra merely glanced at him. Briefly, he caught the impression of a\nwide field. A line of great beasts were crossing it, their long necks\nbobbing as they walked. He nodded in understanding.\n\nA caravan was coming in. That would be trouble, of course, but of minor\nnature. He turned, to follow the glittering figure as it floated toward\nthe path and on, into the village.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs the caravan came to a stop, Naran's beast bent its knees and\ncrouched. He swung himself to the ground.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nHe was getting the hang of this, he told himself. At first, he had been\nforced to fight an almost uncontrollable compulsion to float down\nnormally, but now it seemed quite sensible to grab the heavy fiber\nstrands and swing forward till his feet were solidly on the ground. He\nspun about.\n\n\"All right,\" he shouted. \"Take your reins. Form your unloading circles\non me. We'll be here for a day or two.\"\n\nHe watched as the slings were lifted from the brutes' backs, then turned\nhis attention to the man who was greeting Dar Girdek.\n\nSo this was the Lord of the Mountain Lake. He shook his head. The fellow\nglittered almost from head to foot. Naran examined the jewelry\nappraisingly. He wore a fourth-order cap. They didn't make them any\nheavier than that one. And if there was a device that had been left out,\nhe had never heard of it.\n\nIn addition, he could identify three heavy-duty shields, a power\nlevitator, a handful of destructor and paralysis rings, and a projector\nmedallion capable of forming several hundred cubic feet of solid,\ndetailed illusion. He shook his head.\n\nThis man must have spent the entire income of his estate for several\nyears in assembling this array. There was enough there to outfit a\nbattle group of competent psionics.\n\n\"If this guy needs all that stuff just to get by, he's as near to\npsionic zero as you can get,\" Naran told himself. \"Either that, or he's\nloaded with a power compulsion that's never been equalled.\" He frowned.\n\n\"Or both,\" he added thoughtfully.\n\nHe looked again at the blaze of jewelry.\n\nFaintly, he could sense the sour feel of fear. It acted as a carrier for\na mixture of hatred, envy, and contemptuous hauteur. Naran whistled\nsoftly. There was more, too. He wished he dared try a probe, but with\nall that arsenal of psionic crystalware, it would be unwise.\n\n\"Hit those shields of his and I'd bounce off with a noise like a million\nbells,\" he thought. He turned away.\n\nHe'd have to keep his own mind fully hooded around here. He looked back\nagain, glancing at the distorter rod Barra carried. His eyes widened a\nlittle.\n\n\"Given adequate drive, that thing would stop a Fifth Planet battleship.\"\nHe grinned.\n\n\"Arm a couple of hundred men with those things and they could go out and\ntake the Fifth apart, bit by bit. Then we wouldn't have to worry about\nthose people and their mechanical gadgets.\"\n\nHe dragged his attention back to the business at hand, tapping in on Dar\nGirdek's thoughts.\n\n\"... And we can tour the Estates later today,\" Barra was saying. \"I may\nbe able to show you some worthwhile goods, as well as a few good draft\nbeasts to carry them.\"\n\nNaran risked a light probe, taking advantage of Barra's diverted\nattention.\n\nHe had been right, he thought. It was the \"or both.\" He shook his head.\nThe guy was almost pathetic. Obviously, he wanted to be the greatest man\non the planet. And equally obviously, without his amplifier jewels, he'd\nbe little stronger psionically than one of Dar Girdek's drivers.\n\nAs Dar Girdek followed his host toward the village, Naran turned his\nattention back to his drivers. He would have to make camp and then get\ntogether with that village headman. There'd be plenty of arrangements\nthey would have to make.\n\nHe was surprised at the arrangements Retonga had already made. There\nwasn't much question about it, the entertainment of caravans was\nfamiliar business with this headman. He knew all the problems--and their\nanswers.\n\nOf course, Dar Girdek had told him about the hospitality of Kira Barra,\nbut this had to be seen to be believed. He spent his first really\nrestful night in weeks.\n\nThe next morning, he walked slowly along the path to the drivers' lodge,\npaying little attention to his surroundings. Somehow, in spite of the\nreception given the caravan, he was uneasy.\n\nHe recalled his conversation with Retonga the night before.\n\nThe man had asked questions about the conditions of the trail. He had\nbeen curious about the treatment of the drivers by the master of the\ntrain. Then he had shaken his head, looking out over his village.\n\n\"It is far different here. This is an estate of death and terror, and\nour master is the very lord of these. I was a child when his father\ndied, but I think things were different then.\" He had looked searchingly\nat Naran.\n\n\"I've never mentioned these things before,\" he went on. \"But there's\nsomething--\" He had looked down at the ground, then up again.\n\n\"Our master became Kio through the death of his brother,\" he went on,\n\"and it was through the deaths of other headmen that I was placed in\ncharge of this village.\" He had glanced back into the door of his hut.\n\n\"I had no part in causing those deaths. The life of a headman here in\nTibara is short and none but a fool would fight for this position of\nmine. It is not a good one. The master's demands are heavy and his hand\nis even heavier.\"\n\nThis didn't match with the reputation of Kio Barra as a considerate\nhost--a fair man to do business with. It made him wonder.\n\nHad his brother actually ever left this place? But if not, where were\nhis drivers? What had happened to his train of draft brutes? How had the\ncargo he carried been disposed of?\n\nOh, of course, he knew there were caravan masters who would accept\nfreight and ask a minimum of questions. Goods could be disposed of. And\nthis was a breeding estate. The slaves? He shook his head. Too simple!\n\nHe brought himself back to the present, looking thoughtfully at the\ndrivers' lodge ahead of him. Then he probed gently, trying to establish\nrapport with Dar Girdek. The man could be in real danger.\n\nHe frowned and probed with more force. There was nothing. The frown\ndeepened.\n\nAfter his talk with Retonga, he had established rapport with the caravan\nmaster, but the older man had attached no importance to his suspicions.\n\n\"No,\" he had thought back, \"you are seeing a robber behind every rock\nnow. Kio Barra is a tough master, of course. He's got a big estate here,\nand he really keeps it up to the mark. He's a good host and a really\ngood man to deal with--liberal trader. Remember, I know this guy. I've\nbeen here before.\" There had been the impression of a smile.\n\n\"Besides, this guy's harmless, remember? Sure, he's a businessman. But\nif he should try anything violent, I could take care of him without\ntaking time out to think about it.\" A final, dismissing thought had\ncome.\n\n\"Look, forget about it, will you? If you had to suspect someone of dirty\nwork, pick on some of those northerners. Kio Barra's too well known for\nfair dealing. I'll make a deal with him, then we can go up to the\nnorthern swing and really look around to see if we can find any trace of\nthat caravan of your brother's.\"\n\nNaran kicked at the trail. Dar Girdek was a good trader and a successful\ncaravan master. He knew goods and their value, and he was expert in\nhandling beasts and drivers. But he had never been too sensitive. And\nhe'd absolutely refused to wear a probe amplifier.\n\n\"Look,\" he'd thought disgustedly, \"how would you like to do business\nwith some guy that wore a great, big, yellow headlight to tell you he\nwanted to poke around in your mind?\"\n\nNaran put his foot on the lowest rung of the short ladder leading to the\nlodge door.\n\nUnless he was badly mistaken, he knew now where his brother had gone.\nAnd now Dar Girdek had joined him. The details? He shrugged.\n\nThey were unimportant. But what was next? What would be the next step in\nBarra's plans? And what could be done about this guy? He climbed the\nladder and went into the lodge.\n\nOf course, if the Council found out about this, they could deal with the\nsituation. All they'd need would be a little proof and Kio Barra would\nbe well and promptly taken care of. But how would someone get word out?\n\nThe estate was loaded with surrogates, he knew that. A caravan--even a\nsingle man--would find it impossible to either enter or leave without\nthe knowledge and consent of the Master Protector. He smiled.\n\nHe could just visualize Kio Barra letting anyone out with proof of his\nactivities. The smile faded.\n\nA distant projection? There were those surrogates again. They were broad\ntuned and he knew it. They'd flare like a field of beacons.\n\nOf course, he could get out a flash appeal and it would be heard. He\ngrinned.\n\nNow, there was a nice way to commit suicide. There'd be no time for help\nto arrive, he was sure of that. And no shield would stand up under that\nheavy-duty distorter, even if Barra could only summon a minimum of power\nto operate it. He shook his head, looking around the room.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDrivers were beginning to stir and get to their feet. Naran looked at\nthe flunky.\n\n\"Better get with it, Bintar,\" he said. \"Going to be a bunch of hungry\nmen around you in a couple of minutes.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" The man started out the door, yawning. \"Got to eat, if we don't\ndo anything else.\" He climbed down the ladder.\n\nNaran glanced at the drivers.\n\n\"Soon's we've eaten,\" he said, \"I'd like to check up on the long-necks.\nSee whether they've wandered during the night. I'd hate to have them get\nmixed up with the village herd.\"\n\nA driver looked around at him.\n\n\"Aw,\" he protested, \"the master probably pinned 'em down good before he\nleft. Besides, he can identify 'em anyway. They won't go far--not with\nthose herd boys running around.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Naran told him. \"The master would really like spending half a\nday cutting out his long-necks from the village herd. And how about that\nMaster Protector? What would he think of our caravan?\"\n\nThe other looked at him disgustedly. \"Aw, who cares about that? Why\nworry about what one of them witchmen thinks about another? Long's we\ndon't get twisted around, what's the difference?\"\n\nNaran growled to himself. He'd blundered on that one. There was no\nanswer to that argument that he could present. He had learned to\nunderstand--and in some measure sympathize with--the deep-seated\nresentment of the non-psi for the psionic. The non-psionics felt they\nwere just as good men as anyone, yet here were these psionics with their\nincomprehensible powers. And there was nothing to be done about it\nexcept obey.\n\nOf course, they didn't like it--or their masters.\n\nAs far as that went, the caravan herd was unimportant now. The only\ntrouble was Retonga. If the herds were mixed, he would be in real\ntrouble.\n\n\"Well,\" he said aloud, \"I'm not about to get the master to spinning.\nLong's we keep him happy, we'll all be a lot better off. As I said,\nright after breakfast. I want everyone out on the herd.\" He started to\nturn away.\n\n\"Aagh,\" growled the other. \"Why don't you face it? You're just one of\nthose guys likes to toss orders around and make people jump. It's about\ntime someone showed you a few things.\"\n\nNaran turned back. Rosel had been resentful ever since the caravan had\nformed. He had expected to be lead driver on this trip and he'd made no\neffort to hide his fury and disappointment at being displaced in favor\nof a newcomer.\n\nFor an instant, Naran considered. There was no point in continuing his\nmasquerade any further. Dar Girdek was gone and he'd have to take the\ncaravan back anyway--if he could work his way out of here, past Barra.\n\nIf he couldn't get out--if he joined his brother and Dar Girdek--it\nwould make no difference what the caravan drivers thought.\n\nHe could put this man in his place right now. Then, he could give him\nthe job of lead driver.\n\nBut there was something else to think of. If he got the train out of\nhere, he would have to work with this guy. And there would always be an\neven greater resentment added to the normal fear and hatred of the\npsionic. That could demoralize the whole train. Naran sighed.\n\nRosel had put his feelings in the open now and Naran would have to play\nout the role he had assumed.\n\nHe crossed the room to confront Rosel. Abruptly, he thrust a hand out.\nThe other made a grab for it and Naran moved smoothly forward, locking\nthe grasping hand.\n\nQuickly he extended a leg and threw Rosel over it. As the man hit the\nfloor, Naran retained his grip and brought his other hand over, twisting\nthe man's arm. His foot went out, to smack into the man's face, pinning\nhim to the floor. Slowly, he put pressure on the prisoned hand.\n\n\"Once more,\" he said coldly, \"I'm going to have everyone out on the herd\nright after breakfast. Now, do you want to go out and work with 'em, or\ndo I keep winding up on this thing and then have 'em load you up with\nthe rest of the spare gear?\"\n\n\"Aw, look.\" Rosel's voice was muffled. \"Didn't mean a thing, I was just\nmaking a crack.\"\n\n\"Yeah, sure.\" Naran's voice was scornful. \"Just having a little fun\nbefore breakfast. Now you listen to me. So long as I'm lead driver,\nyou're going to do what I say--when I say it. If you give me any more\ntrouble, I'll pull your head off and make you carry it under one arm.\nGot it?\"\n\n\"Ow! Yeah, I got it. You're the lead driver.\"\n\nNaran released his pressure and stepped back.\n\n\"All right,\" he said. \"Let's forget it. Now, we'll get breakfast over\nwith and then we'll take care of the long-necks. You take the drivers\nout, Rosel. I'm going to make some arrangements in the village. Be with\nyou later.\" He swung away.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBarra looked at his reflection with satisfaction. It was too bad, he\nthought, that he didn't have some companion to appreciate his wealth and\npower. He examined his equipment carefully.\n\nEverything was clean. Everything was in order. There was no device\nlacking.\n\nProudly, he looked down at the huge, yellow pendant he was wearing for\nthe first time. It was funny, he thought, that he had never considered a\nprobe unit before. Now that he thought of it, this was a most\nsatisfactory device. Now, he could look into his villagers' minds and\nsee clearly what lay there. Even, he could get some ideas of the\nintentions of visiting caravan masters.\n\nFitting the device and becoming familiar with it had been hard work, of\ncourse, but he had mastered it. And today, he could wear the jewel and\nuse it. It would make the day's work easier.\n\nHe activated his levitator, floated to his boat, and pulled it away from\nits shelter, setting the course toward Tibara.\n\nThe hard part of this operation was over, he thought. The rest was\nsimple routine.\n\nThis caravan master had given him a bit more trouble than some of the\nothers, but his final reaction had been just like all the others. He\nsmiled.\n\nThat flash of incredulity, followed by sudden, horrified comprehension,\nthen blankness, was becoming perfectly familiar. In fact, even this was\nsimple routine.\n\nHe wondered if he might be able to extend just a little. Perhaps he\ncould operate on a wider scale. There should be some way he could work\nout to take over a neighboring estate and go from there.\n\nSurely, there must be some outlet for his abilities, beyond mere\nincrease in the wealth of Kira Barra. And there must be some way to gain\na companion of sorts. He would have to think that over.\n\nHe swung the boat to the pier and floated away, grandly ignoring the\npseudomen who hurried to secure his lines.\n\nHe examined the village with approval as he stood in the center of the\nclearing. There had been a great improvement since he had taken that\nheadman in hand. Perhaps this fellow would be satisfactory--might even\nlearn to take some pride in the appearance of his village--if, that is,\na pseudoman were capable of pride.\n\nHe looked over toward the headman's hut.\n\nThe fellow had come out, followed by the lead driver of the caravan.\nGood, that would save the trouble of hunting the fellow out.\n\nHe concentrated on the caravan slave.\n\n\"Your master has decided to remain at the Residence for a time,\" he\nthought confidently. \"You may have your drivers load up and move to a\nmore permanent location.\"\n\nThe answering thought was unexpectedly distinct.\n\n\"This location looks as though it were designed for a caravan's stay.\nWhere's Dar Girdek?\"\n\nBarra looked at the man in surprise. What was this? This fellow didn't\nthink like any pseudoman. Had Dar Girdek somehow managed to persuade a\nhalfman to act as his lead driver? But why?\n\nHe drew back a little, tensing. There was something wrong here.\n\n\"Now, look,\" persisted the man before him. \"I'd like to see Dar Girdek.\nI'd like to know why I haven't been able to get in touch with him this\nmorning.\"\n\nBarra blinked, then activated the new probe. He would have to find out\nwhat this man knew--how much others might know. Abruptly, he felt a\nviolent return of the fear sickness which had temporarily subsided with\nthe death of Dar Girdek.\n\nThe probe was met by an impenetrable barrier. Barra's eyes widened. This\nman was no halfman, either. He was one of the great psionics.\nFrantically, Barra's thought retraced the past.\n\nWas this an investigator from the Council? Was he, Kio Barra, suspect?\nBut how had any leak occurred? The fear grew, till he could almost smell\nthe sour stench of it. And with it, came a buoying lift of pure fury.\n\nThis man may have unmasked him, to be sure. The Council might even now\nbe sending men to take him, but this spy would never know the results of\nhis work. He would profit nothing here.\n\nHe flipped the distorter from under his arm.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs the Master Protector started to raise his distorter, Naran felt a\nsharp twinge of regret. He had resigned himself to this, and had made\nhis preparations, but he hated to leave Barra to someone else. Of\ncourse, the man had no chance now. The disturbance he had keyed himself\nto make if he were hit with a distorter would be heard by every scholar\nin Ganiadur, and by half the Council. But--\n\nSuddenly, he felt a sort of pity for the killer before him. The guy\nwasn't really altogether to blame. He'd been living for all these years\nwith everything against him.\n\nBorn into a psionic family, he had been the family skeleton--a thing of\ndisgrace--to be hidden from the rest of the world and given tolerant\nprotection.\n\nAnd when this barely tolerated being had managed somehow to gain power\nand get amplifying devices? Well--\n\nThe crystal was leveled at him now. He looked at it indifferently,\nthinking of the man who held it.\n\n\"Poor, lonesome weakling!\"\n\nAbruptly, the clearing was lit up by a blinding red glare. Naran closed\nhis eyes against the searing light. Seconds went by and he opened his\neyes again, looking about the village in confusion.\n\nHad he somehow managed to retain full consciousness of ego, even after\nbeing reduced by a distorter beam? Was there a release into some other\nstate of being? He had felt no--\n\nHe looked at Kio Barra. The man stood, slack-faced, still holding his\ndistorter rod, but gradually allowing it to sag toward the ground. Naran\nshook his head.\n\n\"Now, what goes on?\"\n\nHe probed at the man's mind.\n\nThere was consciousness. The man could think, but the thoughts were dim\nand blurred, with no trace of psionic carrier. The control and amplifier\njewels he wore had lost their inner fire--were merely dull, lifeless\nreflectors of the sunlight. This man could do no more toward bringing\nlife to the jewels than could the village headman--perhaps, even less.\n\nNaran looked at him in unbelieving confusion, then turned as a sudden,\nscreaming thought struck his mind.\n\n\"A stinking, high-nosed witchman! And we thought he was one of us! Ate\nwith him. Argued with him. Even fought with him. I've got to get away.\nGot to!\"\n\nThere was desperation in the thought. And there were hatred overtones,\nwhich blended, then swelled.\n\nAs the terrorized ululation went on, Naran swung his head, locating the\nsource. He'd have to do something about that--fast. The fellow would\nreally demoralize the caravan now--even infect the big saurians--cause a\nstampede.\n\nThis guy had some power of projection and his terror was intensifying it\ntill anyone could receive the disturbing impulses, even though complete\nunderstanding might be lacking.\n\nNaran lifted himself from the ground, arrowing rapidly toward the\ncaravan, his mind already forming the thoughts which he hoped would\nsoothe the frantic fear and--at least to some degree--allay the frenzy\nof hatred that swelled and became stronger and stronger.\n\nBarra could wait.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs Barra swung his distorter to bear, he concentrated on the violent\npulse needed to trigger the jewel, his mind closed to all else. He\nturned his attention on his target.\n\nSuddenly, he recognized the curiously tender expression which had formed\non the face of the man before him.\n\nFrantically, he tried to revise his thoughts--to recall the blaze of\nenergy he had concentrated to build up.\n\nIt was too late.\n\nWith a sense of despair, he recognized the sudden, lifting, twisting\nagony that accompanied the flare of the overloaded power crystal. For an\neternal instant, his universe was a blinding, screaming, red nightmare.\n\nThe flare died and he watched dully as the unharmed man before him\nlooked about unbelievingly, then looked back to carefully examine him.\n\n\"Oh,\" he told himself dully. \"I suppose they'll take care of me, but\nwhat of it? They'll put me somewhere. I'll lose everything. It'll be\njust like the place Boemar thought of sending me, when I--\"\n\nFuriously, he tried to summon some tiny bit of energy to activate the\ndistorter.\n\nNothing happened.\n\nThe man whose pity had destroyed him suddenly frowned, then turned and\ndarted away. Dully, Barra watched him, then he turned, to look around\nthe village. His face contorted in new terror.\n\nSome of the village men were moving toward him, curious expressions on\ntheir faces. He backed away from them and turned.\n\nA few more had moved to block his path.\n\nThey were grunting and hissing to each other. Barra looked from face to\nface, then looked over toward the well.\n\nThere were men over there, too, by the pile of stones. The old man who\nworked on the retaining walls of the village had picked up some of his\nbuilding material.\n\nHe stood, eying Barra calculatingly, a stone poised in each hand.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Weakling, by Everett B.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
