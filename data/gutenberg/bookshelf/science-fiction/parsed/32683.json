Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\ncopyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\n\n[Sidenote: _We journey to far places, driven on by ideals. We fight for\nlost causes, sacrificing our lives because the things we fight for seem\nworthwhile. But are we right? Are they worth being killed over? Perhaps.\nThen again, maybe we'll know better--The Next Time We Die _]\n\n\nNow in the nooning, with the sun high overhead and the shadows huddling\ndispiritedly at their sides, the threat that existed in this wild desert\nwas completely invisible.\n\nThe girl, Nora Martin, said, \"What I don't understand is why we were so\nstupid as to come here in the first place. We could have stayed on Earth\nand had homes and families.\" Becoming conscious of what she had said,\nshe hastily corrected herself. \"I mean, each of us could have had a home\nand a family.\"\n\nPike McLean shifted the muzzle of the Rangeley just a trifle, adjusting\nit so that the cross hairs in the periscope sight covered the exact spot\nwhere he expected, and hoped, the next native would appear. He tried to\ndig the sand out of his eyes. Since he had sand on his hands, this only\ngot more of the gritty particles into his eyes. He wished fervidly for a\ndeep satisfying breath of the thick muggy air of Earth before he died.\n\n\"This air, there's not anything to it,\" he muttered.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe girl glanced sharply at him. She had eyes that were as blue as the\nskies of Earth on a sunny day. The dirt on her nose made her look human.\nAt this moment, the eyes had anger in them. Back of the anger were\nunshed tears.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Did you hear what I said?\" she repeated.\n\nMcLean shifted his long body so that it lay a little lower in the\ndepression in the sand. \"I guess you came here because you're an\narcheologist and you're getting paid to examine ruins. I came here\nbecause I'm a roustabout who is supposed to be able to do anything,\nwhich is what I'm getting paid for.\" He paused and removed an offending\ngrain of sand from his right eyelid. \"Dying is not much,\" he continued.\n\"Why are you so frazzled about it? It doesn't even hurt, when you really\nget to it, that is.\"\n\n\"You talk as if you have died before!\"\n\n\"Why, I have,\" he answered, surprise in his voice. \"Hundreds of times.\nSince we first crawled out on the mud flats and grew feet and left our\ngills behind us, that's a long time. We've been dying ever since, that's\nfor sure. And probably for a much longer time.\"\n\n\"I thought you were talking about reincarnation,\" the astonished\narcheologist said.\n\n\"So I was,\" the roustabout answered. \"They're only different approaches\nand aspects of the same problem. We reincarnate in order to take another\ncrack at the puzzle of evolution. Some day we'll solve it! Then we will\nfall heir to the farther stars instead of just this little old duck pond\nof a solar system.\"\n\n\"You sound very sure of yourself. What proof--\"\n\n\"It's in the book,\" McLean answered. \"We're _homo sapiens_. And that\nmeans something. The mud flats didn't stop us. We crawled off of them\nand on to the high ground and into the forests and overran a planet. The\natom bomb didn't hold us up too long, even when we got to using it on\neach other. Where in all that space--\" His hand swept upward in an arc\nthat included all the vast expanse of stars dimly seen here on this\nworld even at high noon. \"--is anything that can stop us, when we can\nkeep coming back to take another crack at the problem? Any problem, I\ndon't care what it is, can be solved if we can keep working at it long\nenough!\" Enthusiasm sounded in his voice, then faded out. He drew his\nhand down. Two of the fingers were missing.\n\nMcLean stared at the ooze of blood and plasma and set his lips against\nthe pain. \"That damned needle ray can sure knock a hunk out of a man,\"\nhe said.\n\n\"Oh, Pike, why did you have to be so careless!\" Sliding the pack from\nher back, she opened it. Taking great care not to get her head above the\nedge of the hole, she opened the first-aid kit and applied antiseptics\nand bandages to the stumps of the two fingers. Alternately she scolded\nand then soothed him.\n\n\"You do that real well,\" he said, approvingly. \"You should have been a\nmama, instead of an archeologist, and raised a whole slather of kids, so\nyou could bandage all their cuts and pat away all their bruises.\"\n\nA longing as deep as the seas of Earth showed in her blue eyes.\n\"That--that was what I wanted. But I got side-tracked into a\nprofession.\" The longing was washed away in a film of sudden tears.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMcLean closed his lips even tighter. He applied one eye to the sight of\nthe Rangeley, now adjusted to function as a periscope. Level and\napparently free of all danger, the grim red sands swept away to the low\nmountains in the distance. The air was so clear and so thin that he\ncould even see the ruins of the city that had been their destination\nwhen they had left the ship. The city was a vast mass of tumbled masonry\nsprawled on treeless, forgotten hills. On the sand nothing moved. Yet\ndeath was there in front of him, and his eye had certainly passed over\nit.\n\n\"The nice little foxes are all in their nice little holes,\" he said.\n\nThe girl made a wan effort to smile. \"How are your fingers? I mean, do\nthey hurt much?\"\n\n\"They feel like I don't have them.\" Grinning at his own joke, McLean\nswung the sight of the Rangeley around to their desert buggy. The\nover-size tires loomed up like huge rubber doughnuts sprouting\nmysteriously out of the desert sand. The door of the car was invitingly\nopen.\n\n\"It's only a quarter of a mile,\" he said. \"We could sprint that far. But\nhow could we run at all without legs?\"\n\n\"We have legs,\" the girl said eagerly. \"Let's try to make the car.\"\n\n\"We wouldn't have 'em, if we jumped out of this hole and started\nrunning. The little foxes have sharp teeth.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" Her voice dropped as the color faded from her eyes. \"Then what are\nwe going to do?\"\n\n\"Stay here and hope they send out another desert car from the ship\nlooking for us. If we don't return in a reasonable time, they may become\ncurious about us.\"\n\n\"And if they don't come?\"\n\n\"We'll try to out-fox the foxes.\"\n\n\"If we had a radio--\"\n\n\"We do, but it's in our buggy. If we were there, we wouldn't need a\nradio. The dur-steel body of the car would stop the beam from that\nneedle gun. How the hell does it happen that wild tribesmen, with no\nscience and no industry, living here in a desert, have a weapon like\nthat needle ray gun?\"\n\n\"When they built their city there, they weren't desert tribesmen,\" the\ngirl explained. \"They were going somewhere, then, and they had science\nand at least light industry, and skilled workers. When they came back to\nthe desert, they left everything behind them except their weapons. A\nprimitive will always choose a weapon over anything else. He will value\nit as he values his life, because that is what it is.\"\n\n\"Why did they come back to a desert?\"\n\n\"That's one thing we expected to discover in their ruined city, Pike.\"\nThe girl's voice took on the patient tone of the expert instructing the\namateur. \"War with a neighboring tribe, in which they were defeated,\nmight have been the reason. Change in climate might have been a factor.\nPerhaps there were other reasons too, famine, pestilence. They started\nup, then went back. This has happened so often that it seems to me that\nthe seeds of decay always sprout at the same time as the seeds of\ngreatness.\"\n\n\"I wish I were an archeologist and a philosopher, and understood all\nthose things,\" McLean said, longingly.\n\n\"You are a man, which is more important.\"\n\n\"Do you mean _male_?\"\n\n\"No. Man. _M-a-n_.\" She spelled the word for him. \"Man. The highest\nlevel reached by the life force on Earth, to date. Or in the Solar\nSystem, as we know it.\"\n\n\"Oh, you mean the top of the heap,\" McLean said. \"Sure, we know that.\nBut the little foxes hiding in their nice little holes don't know it.\nThey don't think that being a man is so much.\" A thin sparkle of light\nflickered through the air above his head as he spoke. He had the\nimpression that a crackling sound went with the death beam, like the\nrustle of static in space. \"See! That's what they think of us! Targets!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe girl dodged downward. McLean advised her not to be a sissie and\nturned his attention to the sight of the Rangeley. Nothing was in sight.\nThis did not surprise him. He had not expected to see anything except\nsand. \"I betcha I'm looking right at two or three of those devils and\nnot seeing them,\" he grumbled.\n\n\"They are adept at protective coloration,\" the girl said. \"Let me look.\"\n\nShe applied her eye to the scope of the Rangeley, moving it on its\nmounting so that it swept across the sand. \"There's one!\" she said,\nsudden excitement in her voice.\n\n\"Where?\" McLean demanded, pushing her aside and put his eye to the\nscope.\n\n\"Right where I have the sight centered. Can't you see that little bulge?\nRight there.\" She started to stand up and point.\n\nMcLean jerked her backward and shoved her face into the sand. \"Don't get\nso excited that you start to stand up,\" he growled. Light sparkled\nthrough the air above them.\n\n\"I forgot,\" the girl said, meekly. \"Let me get my head up. You've got my\nnose and mouth full of sand.\"\n\n\"Out here, you only forget once,\" the roustabout said, releasing her. \"I\nstill don't see anything,\" he said, peering through the scope. He moved\naside as she pushed at his shoulder.\n\nAgain she studied the terrain. Making a minute adjustment of the sight,\nshe pulled the trigger. The Rangeley burped softly--it was a gas\noperated gun--then three quick explosions took place out on the desert\nwhere the explosive pellets hit. A wild yell followed. McLean got his\neye to the sight in time to see a tribesman spin crazily within fifty\nfeet of them. The fellow turned one last cartwheel, then collapsed into\na bundle of dead rags.\n\n\"You got one!\" McLean yelled triumphantly.\n\n\"Did--did I? I'm sorry--I mean--\" Her voice trailed choked with fear.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe looked quickly at her. The girl's eyes were filled with tears. \"I\ndidn't really mean to do it,\" she blubbered.\n\n\"Cut out that damned caterwauling!\" he ordered. \"This is war. The fact\nthat just you and me, and some wild Martian Indians, are involved in\nthis war doesn't make it any less deadly. If we don't get them, they'll\nget us.\" He held up his bandaged hand. \"Do you think the tribesman who\ndid that was after my fingers? He wasn't! What he wanted was my head!\"\n\n\"All right, all right, I understand this intellectually, it's just that\nmy emotions got involved.\"\n\n\"Get them uninvolved,\" he said. \"How could you see that Martian when I\ncouldn't?\"\n\n\"Better ability to differentiate colors, probably,\" the girl answered.\n\"Women can usually see colors better than men. That was the way I picked\nhim out.\"\n\n\"Do some more differentiating between colors,\" he invited, waving her\nback to the sight of the Rangeley. \"Maybe, by Harry, we'll get out of\nhere alive after all!\" Hope surged in his voice. \"If we do--\"\n\n\"If we do, then what?\" the girl asked.\n\nHe shook his head. \"If we do get out, I couldn't tell you anyhow.\nThere's no point in talking. But in case we don't get out, I want you to\nknow that you're a mighty nice kid.\"\n\n\"Well--thanks.\" Her eyes were deep blue again, like the skies of Earth.\nShe moved toward him.\n\n\"Hey, what did you do that for?\"\n\n\"Just an impulse. I always kiss men who tell me I'm a nice kid.\"\n\n\"Nice kid, nice kid, nice kid,\" McLean said.\n\n\"You're too eager.\" The blush on her cheeks was visible through the\nsand. Hastily she applied her eye to the sight of the Rangeley. McLean\nsighed. He had never had a girl. It seemed to him that fate was playing\nhim a cruel joke to try to give him one under these conditions, in a\nhole in the sand with wild Martian tribesmen surrounding him. He\nmentally estimated the distance to the desert buggy, considered their\nchances of making this trip and arriving alive. He was shaking his head\nat his own estimate when the Rangeley burped again.\n\n\"I missed!\" the girl said. \"Oh! Here he comes!\"\n\nMcLean shoved her away from the sight. The Martian was moving toward\nthem, fast. Instead of a gun, he had a spear.\n\n\"You didn't miss,\" the roustabout said. \"You hit him but you only\nwounded him. This is his death charge!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe pressed the trigger of the Rangeley. The gun burped twice. In the\ndistance the exploding slugs threw up small geysers in the sand. The\nnative kept coming. In the sight, he looked to be ten feet tall.\nVaulting the Rangeley, he seemed to grow even more in stature. He\nscreamed at the top of his lungs as he thrust downward with the spear.\n\nMcLean shoved the girl away from him, rolled in the other direction. He\ncaught a glimpse of a metal spear point burying itself in the sand in\nthe exact spot where he had been lying. The roustabout wrapped both arms\naround the legs of the Martian and yanked hard. The fellow came down, on\ntop of McLean. The human shoved him aside.\n\nThe Martian was a twisting, squirming, raging, biting, clawing, kicking\nwild tangle of knobby knees and knobbier elbows. Whichever of these\nknobby joints hit, it hurt. The fellow had a knife in his belt, which he\nwas struggling to get free. McLean, seeing the knife, was trying equally\nhard to keep him from getting it.\n\nThe human caught the hilt of the knife with his left hand. With his\nright fist, he struck at the native's stomach. Grunting, the Martian\nopened his mouth and tried to bite McLean. The roustabout, no stranger\nto this kind of fighting, butted him in the open mouth with the top of\nhis head, then struck again, savagely, at the stomach. He felt his fist\nsink home in the leathery tissue there.\n\nThe native grunted and went limp. McLean jerked the knife from its\nscabbard. He did not have to use it. A series of fine tremors passing\nthrough his body, the Martian was dying. The explosive slug from the\nRangeley had finally done its work. With relief McLean let the body\ndrop.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMcLean wiped sweat and sand from his face. \"That was the death charge,\nall right. But you didn't miss. See--\" He pointed to the wound in the\nMartian's chest.\n\nThe Rangeley stopped burping as the girl took her eyes from the sight\nand looked around. Glancing at the Martian, she hastily averted her\nface. An instant later, she was back at the sight. The Rangeley began\nburping again.\n\nMcLean had the impression that all the time he had been fighting with\nthe Martian, the Rangeley had been burping.\n\nShe had kept the gun going!\n\nThere was something he wanted to say to this archaeologist. He waited\nuntil he had enough breath to say it.\n\n\"You're all right,\" he said at last. \"I mean you use your head and keep\nthe others holed up while I fight this one.\"\n\nShe flashed a smile at him. \"They're not holed up, they're running,\" she\nanswered.\n\nMcLean lifted his head above the level of the hole. A corpse was\nsprawled almost at the muzzle of the Rangeley. A second lay fifty feet\naway. A third was perhaps a hundred yards distant.\n\nWhile he had been fighting the berserk Martian, the others had seized\nthe opportunity to charge.\n\n\"Good girl! You saved our necks.\" He watched the running tribesmen. She\nwas keeping the sand at their heels thoroughly stirred up with slugs\nfrom the Rangeley.\n\n\"Wonderful!\" McLean breathed. \"Lift your sights just a little--\"\n\nThe Rangeley went into silence. Looking down, he saw that her shoulders\nwere shaking with sobs.\n\n\"I know how you feel,\" he said, gently. \"But you had to do it, to save\nour necks. Come on! Let's get back to our car while they're still\nrunning and we have the chance!\" He swung into action.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCollapsing the sight into place, he swung the Rangeley and its tripod\nmounting over his shoulder. Catching the girl by one hand, he began to\nrun.\n\nTo both, the car looked like heaven. It was that, and more. Here in this\ndesert each had found in the other something that he had searched for\nall his life and had not found. There was heaven in this thought. McLean\ncould hear the girl panting as she ran beside him, but she was also\nlaughing. He began to laugh too, from pure happiness. He squeezed her\nhand and she squeezed back.\n\nHis laughter went into quick silence as he saw the tube of the needle\nray gun projecting past the rear tire of the desert car. The bright,\nbaleful eye of a Martian crouching there was visible behind the weapon.\n\n\"It's a trap!\" he gasped. \"They ran on purpose, knowing we would beat it\nto our car as soon as they were gone.\"\n\nSkidding to a halt, he tried to bring the Rangeley off his shoulder. The\nneedle ray gun winked at him. He coughed and went down in the sand.\n\nThe gun winked again, spitting its bright eye of light at the girl. She\nwent down like a falling doll.\n\nMcLean pulled himself up on one knee and one hand. There was a hole in\nhis chest as big as his fist, but there was no pain. The high energy\nradiation from the needle gun seared the nerve endings so that no\nsensations were transmitted.\n\nThe roustabout shook his fist at the native crouched under the car.\n\n\"You got us this time,\" he yelled. \"But we'll be back again. You can't\nlick us. We'll get you if it takes another million years.\" The drive\nthat had brought _homo sapiens_ up from the mud flats was in his voice.\n\nHis head began to swim. He took another deep breath. Beside him, the\ngirl lay completely silent. Only her eyes showed that she knew what had\nhappened.\n\nMcLean looked at her. There was still something that he wanted to say.\nHis mind was fogging and he had difficulty in finding the words.\n\n\"The next time through, I want to meet you earlier,\" he said at last. \"I\nwant us to have the chance we missed this trip, of a home and a bunch\nof--\" He coughed. \"And a bunch of kids,\" he ended.\n\nThe girl said nothing. She was beyond the ability to speak. But she\nunderstood him. The glow that came into her eyes made them as beautiful,\nand as full of promise, as the skies of Earth.\n\nMcLean quietly laid down.\n\nThe returning tribesmen danced their wild victory dance around the two\nhumans. Level and bare, the endless sands of Mars stretched far away.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Next Time We Die, by Robert Moore Williams\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE NEXT TIME WE DIE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 32683.txt or 32683.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/2/6/8/32683/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
