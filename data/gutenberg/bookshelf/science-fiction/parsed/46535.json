Hornig\n(Managing Editor: Wonder Stories)\n\nPublished                     10 cents a copy\nMonthly                       $1.00 per year\n\n137 West Grand Street, Elizabeth, New Jersey\n\nVolume 1      December, 1933      Number 4\n\n\n\n\nOUR READERS SAY\n\n\n\"The November issue beats the first two by a mile! If this keeps up, I\nwonder what the tenth issue will be like? Sorry that I cannot send an\nEnglish science-fiction column this month, as I haven't heard from the\nother side yet. Have written to South Africa on the stf situation\nthere, but won't promise you anything on it. Will we have a story in\nthe December issue? 'The Other Gods' beat 'The Kingdom of the\nWorm.'\"--Bob Tucker\n\nWe cannot tell what the tenth issue of TFF will be like, but\nyou can get a good idea of what the fifth will be like by reading\nour editorial. We are sorry we did not receive your foreign\nscience-fiction column this month, and would be pleased to hear about\nSouth Africa. You will notice three stories in this issue of TFF.\nWhich of the stories so far published is the best, is a matter of\nopinion. Further on in this department you will learn the varied\nopinions of their merit.\n\n\"What might be called the 'Anti-Ackerman' issue has just arrived. It\nlooks to me like you ought to have advertised it as that, or run a\nstreamer across the top. I think it would have doubled your\nsubscriptions, so many people, it seems, would like to read something\nagainst me. Will you please tone down the remarks about my being the\n'most active fan,' etc? That started with you. You can't say I ever\nhad anything to do with it. Many people reading such statements will\nbecome antagonistic 'just because,' and though I'm going around\nbegging people to like me, still there's no virtue in unnecessarily\ntipping away from you neutral parties.\"--Forrest J. Ackerman\n\nThe editor wishes to drop formalities for a brief paragraph in order\nto make a personal confession, and will therefore speak in the\nsingular. Yes, Forrie, it has all been my fault. I was the one that\ncalled you \"the world's most active fan,\" etc., and really had\nsomething to do with the animosity some of my readers have had toward\nyou. Let me say that I want to apologize--I am very sorry for it. I\nmeant well, but it didn't seem to have been interpreted the way it was\nintended. All those laudatory remarks were really said to let other\nreaders know how much you have done to advance science fiction, but\nfor certain peculiar reasons which can never be foretold, they weren't\ntaken in the proper light. Frankly, this should teach us both a\nlesson--you and I. I should consider carefully every remark I make\nabout anyone or his work, and you should become less prejudiced and\nvehement on any particular subject, and consider the question: \"What's\none man's opinion?\" Your controversy with C. A. Smith is continued in\nthis issue's \"Boiling Point.\"\n\n\"I am highly pleased with your publication, and hope you can make a\nsuccess of it. Glad to see you are printing Lovecraft's excellent\narticle on 'Supernatural Horror in Literature,' and also his 'Other\nGods.' Smith's tale was most entertaining.\"--R. H. Barlow (author of\nthe 'Annals' series)\n\n\"TFF continues to improve, the November issue marking a new high, what\nwith Lovecraft and Smith in the same number.\"--Allen Glasser\n\n\"I find the _Fantasy Fan_ very interesting and think it has a\ngood future. Anybody ought to be willing to pay a dollar for the\nprivilege of reading, for a whole year, the works of Lovecraft, Smith,\nand Derleth. I am glad to see that you announce a poem by Smith in the\nnext issue. He is a poet second to none. Weird poetry possesses an\nappeal peculiar to itself and the careful use of it raises the quality\nof any magazine. I liked very much the department of 'True Ghost\nStories,' and hope you will continue it. The world is full of\nunexplained incidents and peculiar circumstances, the logical reasons\nfor which are often so obscure and hidden that they are lent an\nillusion of the supernatural.\"--Robert E. Howard\n\nWe wish there were more authors and fans that were enthusiastic over\nthe future of weird fiction and _The Fantasy Fan_ as you and our\nother readers are, and were willing to support it. Yes, anyone should\nbe willing to pay a dollar to read the works of the authors you\nmention for a whole year--and you are certainly included in that list,\nalthough you, of course, would not mention that fact. The opinions of\nsuch a popular weird author as yourself carry weight, and it is a\nsupreme pleasure to have you as a subscriber and contributor. Our\ngratitude is unbounded.\n\n\"Delighted to see the November Issue. All the items and departments\nseem well calculated to interest the weird fiction devotee; and since\nthere is no other magazine in this field, TFF ought certainly to be\nable to build up a solid clientele in the course of time.\"--H. P.\nLovecraft\n\n\"Weisinger has done himself proud in both TFF and SFD. If he can only\nkeep going! I wonder what would happen if Schwartz fell down?!!\nLovecraft is O.K., and so is the whole issue; it is interesting. All\nI'm doing is praising your mag, but what else can I do?\"--Kenneth\nPritchard\n\nWithout Schwartz and Weisinger, science fiction fan material would\nreceive a terrific blow from which it would never recover. We are glad\nto see that you are boosting our magazine; thanks for your enthusiasm.\n\n\"One is inclined to believe that H. P. Lovecraft's 'The Other Gods'\nshould now have cause to look down upon 'The Kingdom of the Worm,' as\ncreated by Clark Ashton Smith. The latter's tale, at best, was an\ninferior Smith writing, and truly, not one of his best. One must be\nlogical and open-minded, you know. R. H. Barlow is deserving of praise\nfor his 'Annals.' The gentlemen with the musical pen-name of Hoy Ping\nPong produced an enjoyable article on 'How to Write a STF Story:' very\namusing satire.\"--Robert Nelson\n\n\"I surely am delighted with the second issue of TFF--a big step\nforward from the first edition! By all means keep up the good work\nthat you have started. This is just the thing we non-scientifictionists\nneed. Lovecraft, Smith, Wandrei, Howard, and Quinn, I hope, will be\nyour main contributors as they just about hold up the weird and\nfantastic candle. I look for big things from you! 'The Kingdom of the\nWorm' was quite light and weak and far below the Smith standard--he is\nmy favorite author and I know what he can do as I have nearly all of\nhis stories and poems. The idea of portrayal was novel but many more\npages could have been written. It seemed to me that the climax came\ntoo quickly, and with a less startling denouement than is customary\nwith Mr. Smith's work. However, I was gladly surprised to see the\nstory in this new magazine's pages. 'Supernatural Horror in\nLiterature' by H. P. Lovecraft is intensely interesting.\"--F. Lee\nBaldwin\n\nOne has his full right to like or dislike a story, and while you and\nthe previous writer believed Smith's tale to be below his standard,\nmany have written in acclaiming it one of his best. If the tale had\nappeared in _Weird Tales_, you might have thought so also, but\nseeing that TFF is only a struggling little publication, you might\nhave \"hypnotised\" yourself into believing that it was not up to his\naverage. And then again, you must be in the mood when you read weird\nstories. Reading them under unfavorable conditions may force a\nderogatory opinion of the tale upon you.\n\n\"The second TFF was good! Hope you will get more staff writers who are\nfamiliar with fantastic fiction as you go along. Glad to see\nLovecraft's article. C. A. Smith's tale was fine. Keep up their\npublication in spite of the opposition which will be forthcoming of\n'pure' stf addicts.\"--Lester Anderson\n\n\"The second issue was read with much interest and enjoyment. It showed\nconsiderable improvement over the first issue. The high spots were\nClark Ashton Smith's story 'The Kingdom of the Worm' and the beginning\nof H. P. Lovecraft's article on 'Supernatural Horror in Literature.'\nSmith's story was splendid and I hope to see much more of his work in\nTFF. Lovecraft's article began very promisingly, my only criticism\nbeing that the instalment was much too short.\"--H. Koenig.\n\n\"I am glad to learn that TFF will be devoted henceforth to the weird\nin fiction, for I feel that truly fantastic literature, as\ndistinguished from the merely pseudo-scientific, is entitled to the\nfullest support; a support hitherto given to the stf type. I feel\ncertain that a large and appreciative following may be built up among\nthe disciples of this branch of literature. My best wishes to the\nsuccess of TFF.\"--Richard F. Searight\n\nFollowing are two letters in direct contrast.\n\n\"I have read the October issue of TFF from cover to cover and enjoyed\nit thoroughly. I have one objection, though. Since TFF is a magazine\ndevoted to the discussion of weird fiction, you should cut down on the\nstf stuff. You'll find plenty of readers who will enjoy it without\nhaving to add so much science fiction talk.\"--Emil Petaja\n\n\"Please keep on using the same kind of paper and add more pages. Was\nsorry to hear that TFF is leaning toward weird fiction. Why do you\nencourage superstition with all the pronouncements of science against\nit? I like the magazine fine, all except the weird part. I never have\nread a good weird tale. Why do they print the science fiction and\ninterplanetary stories of Kline, Hamilton, and Williamson in _Weird\nTales_, for weird tales, interplanetary stories are not weird.\"--Lloyd\nFowler.\n\nNow, considering the two above letters, what is the poor editor to do?\nFor the present, we will continue to use both stf and weird material,\nleaning toward the weird and printing only weird stories--except, of\ncourse, in the January issue, which will be chiefly weird. By the way,\nwe believe that the January number will have quite opposite effects\nupon Messrs. Petaja and Fowler. We are sorry to hear that Mr. Fowler\nhas never read a good weird story. We must pity him. Has he ever tried\na magazine known as _Weird Tales_ by any chance? But all kidding aside,\nwe will take his suggestions into consideration.\n\nFor some reason known only to themselves, _Weird Tales_ has refused to\naccept the TFF ad for their January, 1934 issue. Perhaps they think\nthey have competition! We had intended to make our January number\nentirely weird with 24 pages, but now find it inadvisable, because of\nthe rejection of our ad. We find that it would be best to conserve the\nFantasy Fan Fund for future issues, rather than put everything into\none issue.\n\n\n\n\nMY SCIENCE FICTION COLLECTION\n\nby Forrest J. Ackerman\n\nPart Four\n\n\nIn my collection are the manuscripts of such stories as \"West of the\nEarth\" (renamed \"In Martian Depths\") by Juve, Miss Long's \"The Last\nMan\" (\"Omega\"), \"The Egg from the Lost Planet\" (\"Girl from Mars,\" by\nBreuer-Williamson), Skidmore's \"Romance of Posi and Nega,\" \"Lancer in\nthe Crystal\" ... \"The Cities of Ardathia\" ... \"In the Land of the\nBipos\" ... \"The Machine Man of Ardathia\"... \"By the Hands of the Dead\"\n.... \"Seed of the Toc-Toc Birds\" .... \"The Head of Apex,\" and others\nall by Francis Flagg ... \"The Golden Bough,\" by Dr. Keller, Ed Earl\nRepp's \"Metal World\", Bob Olsen's \"My Martian Sweetheart\", pages from\ndifferent Edmond Hamilton stories, and others, plus the entire serial\nby C. Willard Diffin, \"Two Thousand Miles Below.\" I have, in addition,\na translation into French of David H. Keller's \"Stenographer's Hands,\"\nwhich originally appeared in _Amazing Stories Quarterly_. The French\nversion is known as \"Les mains et la machine.\"\n\nAlso, there are four letter files and a large cabinet--all chock full\nof correspondence from authors and fans.\n\nThere is one portion of my collection yet to be described: the\nscientifilms. In a large box are advertisements, press-sheets,\nreviews, write-ups, publicity copy, photos, \"cuts,\" and all similar\nmaterial from dozens of movie magazines, newspapers, other\nperiodicals, film companies and all parts of the world on the\nscientific from long years ago up to even those to be produced in the\nfuture. The amount of material covered in this file is impossible to\ndescribe.\n\n(In the installments Mr. Ackerman tells about his scientifilm\n\"stills\".)\n\n\n\n\nBirkett's Twelfth Corpse\n\nby August W. Derleth\n\n\nThe wall of hate that stood between the two old rivermen, Fred Birkett\nand Hank Blum, had grown from a strange and gruesome rivalry--the\nfinding of dead bodies of persons drowned in the Wisconsin River at\nSac Prairie. At the time of the tragic drowning of Bud Enders, the\nrivermen were tied--each had found eleven bodies in the past forty\nyears. It was said by each of them, and repeated in Sac Prairie, that\nBud Enders' body would decide the contest.\n\nThe sympathy of Sac Prairie was with Birkett, a kindly old man in\ncontrast to the sullen surliness of Blum, who was, too, somewhat\nyounger. Birkett had always joked about his odd luck at finding bodies\nin the river, and still looked upon his almost uncanny way of knowing\nwhere the bodies had been taken by the swift current as more amusing\nthan not. But Blum had brooded upon his rival's luck ever since\nBirkett had earned a five-hundred dollar reward for finding the corpse\nof a young student who had fallen into the Wisconsin while drunk,\nalmost a decade before. Now Blum made no effort to conceal his violent\nhatred for Birkett, nor could Birkett keep down his dislike for his\nrival.\n\nBud Enders was drowned on a warm night in July, and twenty boats put\nout from Sac Prairie within an hour after he went down. Fred Birkett\nand Hank Blum were among them. Both the old men headed downstream,\nknowing by long past experience that the swift current in mid-channel,\nwhere the youth was drawn under, would quickly roll the body below Sac\nPrairie toward the long clay river bank southeast of the village,\nlocally known as the Yellowbanks district.\n\nToward dawn, Fred Birkett found Bud Enders' body, rolling along in\nshallow but swift water crossing a sand-bar just above the\nYellowbanks. The moon was out, and he had no difficulty seeing the\nbody, which he immediately caught with a boathook and secured to the\nboat without taking it from the water. Then he edged his boat out of\nthe current and made swiftly upstream.\n\nJust where Hiney's Slough enters the Wisconsin, he met Blum. He could\nnot help boasting. \"Just made my dozen,\" he called to Hank in a gruff,\nyet faintly triumphant voice.\n\nBlum turned his boat and swung across current toward him.\n\nBirkett rested on his oars. Unaware of the fury that consumed his\nrival, he went on, \"Well, we couldn't both find him. Let the best man\nwin, I always said,\" and smiled in the satisfaction of feeling himself\nthe better of the two.\n\nBlum had said nothing, but now he was looking cautiously upstream and\ndown, his eyes scanning the surface of the water for sight of any\nboat, his ears waiting to catch any sound that might indicate the\napproach of other searchers. The two boats lay in quiet water, away\nfrom the current.\n\nWhether or not Birkett heard Blum loosen and jerk out one oar is\nproblematical. He turned toward Blum just as the oar descended and\ncaught him a glancing blow on the side of the head, toppling him from\nhis boat and turning the boat with him. Then, with a savage lunge, he\npushed Birkett's boat out of reach of the older man just as he came\ncoughing and gasping to the surface of the water. With another quick\nmovement, Blum detached Enders' body from the overturned boat. He made\nno attempt to catch the body, knowing that the current would not carry\nit from this quiet water, and he could always return and find it.\n\nThen he shot away, unmindful of Birkett's despairing cries, and secure\nin the knowledge that Birkett could not swim very well. A little way\nupstream he paused and listened. There was no sound from below;\nBirkett had gone down. A cunning smile crossed his lips. Edging the\nboat into shallow water, he let himself fall fully clothed into the\nriver, wetting himself thoroughly, except for his torn hat, which he\nthrew into the bottom of the boat to give it the appearance of having\nbeen hastily torn away from his head and thrown there. Then he got\nback into the boat and rowed furiously toward Sac Prairie.\n\nThe circle of boats was now further downstream, and he did not have to\nrow up quite as far as he drifted down. He timed his entrance well,\nfor the boy's cap had just been found along shore, and the searchers\nwere excited over their find. Quite suddenly he shot from under the\nbridge into the yellow glow of lanterns held high above the water.\n\n\"Birkett's gone under,\" he shouted frantically. \"His boat tipped just\nabove the Yellowbanks!\"\n\nAnyone who doubted his cries was easily convinced by his bedraggled\nappearance, and it did not require his explanation that he had gone\ninto the water after Birkett to explain the wetness of his clothes. He\ntold hastily that the old man fought hard, that he had had to hit him\nfinally, and had at last reluctantly to let him go in order to save\nhimself.\n\nAs he led the rowboats to a spot a hundred yards above the entrance to\nHiney's Slough, where in the quiet water the two bodies still lay.\nBlum was enjoying the irony of the knowledge that his twelfth body\nwould be that of his old rival. He broke into speech again, excitedly\ntelling about the accident, and explaining that the boat had long\nsince gone downstream, swept away by the powerful current in which it\nhad tipped. He pointed out approximately the place where the accident\nhad occurred, and went glibly over his story a third time. Then he\nleft the searchers, and pulled into the current toward the dark waters\nwhere Birkett had actually gone down.\n\nThat much Sac Prairie was later able to piece together. What happened\nafter that is more obscure and fraught with horrific suggestion. It is\ncertain that he went downstream, and equally certain that he seemed to\nbe heading for Hiney's Slough, though one or two disputed this point\nlater. Despite the moon, it was difficult to observe Blum's progress\ndownstream, for he was soon lost in the very heavy shadows on the\nquiet water surrounding the slough's junction with the river.\n\nIn the babble of sound made by the searchers above the slough Blum\nmight have called for some time and not have been heard, though this\nis doubtful. At any rate, during a lull in the conversation, someone\npicked up the sound of frantic calling. Everyone stood and listened.\nOnce again came a sharp call, in a voice which was immediately\nidentified as Hank Blum's. The call was heavy with horror and fear.\nThen another call began to sound, but was abruptly stopped, almost as\nif it had been rudely shut off by a hand clapped over the lips thru\nwhich it came.\n\nThe boats immediately pulled away toward Hiney's Slough.\n\nAt first there was nothing to be seen except the bottoms of two\noverturned boats, one of which was Blum's, the other Birkett's. Then\nsomeone saw the body of Ender over against one bank, apparently just\nwashing up from deep water. Quite near it, partly submerged, they\nfound the bodies of Hank Blum and Fred Birkett.\n\nBlum was dead, but he had not been drowned. He had been strangled. For\nwhen the horrified searchers pulled him out of the water, they found\nFred Birkett's dead fingers sunk deep in the flesh of Blum's neck.\n\nBirkett had found his twelfth corpse.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nCLUB NEWS\n\n\nMr. Glasser informs us that he will have more news about the Fantasy\nFans' Fraternity for our February issue.

In\nfact, no fantasy collection could ever be considered 'fair' without a\ngoodly number of these 'classics,' as they have been so often termed.\nThe magazines were: _Argosy_, _All-Story_, _Argosy All-Story_,\n_Cavalier_, _Cavalier All-Story_, _Scrap Book_, and _Munsey's\nMagazine_. Dates 1890 and up!\n\nIf the collector is ambitious enough he may try to procure some of the\nEnglish magazines that include fantastics within their covers. Same of\nthem are: _Pearson's Magazine_ (the monthly, not weekly), _The\nStartler_, _Union Jack_, _Magnet_, and _Grit_. The first, by the way,\noriginally printed most of H. G. Wells' early fantasyarns, and it'd be\na feather in any collector's hat if he were, by any chance, able to\nget his hands on one of those rare issues.\n\n(We are sorry to state that Part Five will be the conclusion. In this\nlast part, coming in our February issue, we will have Mr. Schwartz\ntell about fantasy booklets, and he will also inform us about the hard\ncovers.)\n\n\n\n\nThe Flagon of Beauty\n\n(Annals of the Jinns)\n\nby R. H. Barlow\n\n\nThe Princess drooped her long eyelashes. She was really quite pretty\nwhen she did this.\n\n\"And you have brought it?\" she asked softly, her hand stealing into\nhis. He coughed. This being spokesman was a delicate task.\n\n\"Yes, your Highness,\" said the man. \"It is here.\" He touched a small\nparcel beside him on the divan.\n\n\"And you will give it to me?\" she breathed.\n\nSteeling himself, he replied, \"Their terms are the freedom of the\npeople.\"\n\nShe sprang to her feet. \"Never!\"\n\n\"Not for the Flagon?\" he queried harshly.\n\n\"Not even for that.\" Reconsidering, she spoke slowly. \"Five years ago\nI sent a band in search of this fabulous drug, into the low-lying\njungle that cloaks the Ancient Cities, the Cities that no man knows\nwho built, there in the steaming swamps. Men have said that I was\nbeautiful, yet, ironically, he for whom I have wrecked my empire\nscorned me. It was then I bethought me of this flask made in the\nimmemorial years agone, which figured in legend as containing the\nessence of Beauty. Perhaps, I thought, with this I might win him from\nmy rival. Today you have returned; successfully, I grant you; and\ndemand yield of my power for that which I desire. I have been told\nbitter things--that I have ruled mercilessly and tyrannically. That I\nhave, but I cared little for affairs of state since I became enamoured\nof my prince. He has neglected no indignity to impose upon me, but I\ncannot forget him. On the night of my Feast of Peacocks he sneered at\nthe priceless dishes and fed his monkey from the place. The gutter-rat\nhe has an infatuation for entertains him most skillfully, but he\nshares her with the soldiers. He prefers her florid charms to me. This\nI do not understand, but I command you, _give me that flagon_.\"\n\nHe slowly shook his head. \"No, Majesty, I cannot betray their faith.\nFever took many lives in those crumbling ruins.\"\n\n\"I warn you, I am desperate,\" she said imperiously, \"give, or I shall\ntake.\"\n\nHe lowered his gaze and remained silent. Seeing he was adamant, she\nmade a gesture with her head, and a slave stepped from the curtained\nalcove. \"Take this man to the Room of Pain,\" she ordered. In\nconsternation, he sought to dash the frail vessel to the tiles, but it\nwas dexterously twisted from his grasp by the blackamoor.\n\nThe princess laughed insanely.\n\n\n\"My men did well to steal you from under his nose, my wench,\" she\nsneered to the helpless woman at her feet. \"Let me see those carmine\nlips smile at this!\" she added contemptuously, breaking the ancient\nseal covered with writing none could interpret. \"You are startled?\nYes, it is the Flagon! Watch, if you wish, for you may not see when I\nam finished with you.\" She drained the very dregs, and flung the\nstopper in her captive's face. For a long moment there was no change\napparent in her flushed countenance. Then she noticeably paled. Her\nhair swiftly grew leaded and grey, her lips assumed a ghastly pallor,\nand a score of tiny wrinkles appeared on her smooth skin.\n\nShe became an old hag, quite out of place in the splendour of the\nthrone-room.\n\n\n\n\nSUPERNATURAL HORROR IN LITERATURE\n\nby H. P. Lovecraft\n\n(Copyright 1927 by W. Paul Cook)\n\nPart Three\n\n\nThis type of fear-literature must not be confounded with a type\nexternally similar but psychologically widely different; the\nliterature of mere physical fear and the mundanely gruesome. Such\nwriting, to be sure, has its place, as has the conventional or even\nwhimsical or humorous ghost story where formalism or the author's\nknowing wink removes the true sense of the morbidly unnatural; but\nthese things are not the literature of cosmic fear in its purest\nsense. The true weird tale has something more than secret murder,\nbloody bones, or a sheeted form clanking chains according to rule. A\ncertain atmosphere of breathless and unexplainable dread of outer,\nunknown forces must be present; and there must be a hint, expressed\nwith a seriousness and portentousness becoming its subject, of that\nmost terrible conception of the human brain--a malign and particular\nsuspension or defeat of those fixed laws of Nature which are our only\nsafeguard against the assaults of chaos and daemons of unplumbed\nspace.\n\nNaturally we cannot expect all weird tales to conform absolutely to\nany theoretical model. Creative minds are uneven, and the best fabrics\nhave their dull spots. Moreover, much of the choicest weird work is\nunconscious; appearing in memorable fragments scattered through\nmaterial whose massed effect may be of a very different cast.\nAtmosphere is the all-important thing, for the final criterion of\nauthenticity is not the dovetailing of a plot but the creation of a\ngiven sensation. We may say, as a general thing, that a weird story\nwhose intent is to teach or produce a social effect, or one in which\nthe horrors are finally explained away by natural means, is not a\ngenuine tale of cosmic fear; but it remains a fact that such\nnarratives often possess, in isolated sections, atmospheric touches\nwhich fulfil every condition of the true supernatural horror-literature.\nTherefore we must judge a weird tale not by the author's intent, or by\nthe mere mechanics of the plot; but by the emotional level which it\nattains at its least mundane point. If the proper sensations are\nexcited, such a \"high spot\" must be admitted on its own merits as\nweird literature, no matter how prosaically it is later dragged down.\nThe one test of the really weird is simply this--whether or not there\nbe excited in the reader a profound sense of dread, and of contact\nwith unknown spheres and powers; a subtle attitude of awed listening,\nas if for the beating of black wings or the scratching of outside\nshapes and entities on the known universe's utmost rim. And, of\ncourse, the more completely and unifiedly a story conveys this\natmosphere, the better it is as a work of art in the given medium.\n\n(Next month Mr. Lovecraft takes up \"The Dawn of the Horror Tale.\")\n\n\n\n\nSpurs of Death\n\nby Natalie H. Wooley\n\n\nThe warden leaned back in his chair as he watched the door close, then\nturned to the man who stood looking out of the window.\n\n\"Well, Jim?\" he queried. The other came slowly back to the desk and\nreseated himself. His face was puzzled.\n\n\"Who was that, Tom? He seems strangely familiar, and yet I can't seem\nto place him.\"\n\n\"That man was Cliff Williams, the cowboy murderer,\" said the warden.\n\"You may have seen his picture in the papers. He gets the chair next\nmonth for the three murders he has committed.\"\n\nJim Kelton registered surprise.\n\n\"He doesn't look like the sort of person to do such a thing like that.\nHe seems almost a kid.\"\n\nThe warden smiled grimly. \"His looks are deceiving. He has killed\nthree men in the last ten years, and as far as anyone knows, without\nany reason. I'll tell you the story, if you care to hear it.\"\n\nThe other assented.\n\n\"Well, the first one was a cow hand down in Texas about ten years ago.\nHe was working on a ranch down there and he and this fellow got in an\nargument over something. He shot him. Then he raked his face open with\nhis spurs. That was the thing that trapped him in the end. Every time\nhe killed, he marked his victim's face. Horrible, I grant you. Well,\nhe disappeared, and finally the case was forgotten. He was a kid of\nnineteen or twenty then. Five years later he turned up in Oregon.\nWorked on the Lazy T ranch there. All the men liked him, too. He was\nquiet, knew his business, and never talked much. Then one day, he came\nin from line camp and the foreman gave him his pay. There seemed to be\nsome mistake in it, and he went to the ranch house to see Danby, the\nowner. None of the boys noticed him come out, but when the cook went\nto call him to dinner, he found Danby dead. Choked to death, his face\nripped open, and the cowboy gone. When they went to look for Williams,\nhe was gone. When they next heard of him, the police got a call to\ninvestigate a brawl in a Laredo saloon. When they arrived and broke\nthrough the circle, they saw two men struggling. Suddenly one fell,\nand then before they could reach Williams, he lifted his spurred foot,\nand slashed the face of the fallen man. Then they got him. Then the\npolice started for him. They got him after a terrible fight. The other\nfellow died in the hospital shortly after.\" The warden shook his head.\n\"He's a tough one. Never a muscle when they sentenced him.\"\n\n\"Too bad.\" Jim Kelton rose and picked up his hat. \"Well, guess I'd\nbetter run along. Come out for a game of bridge some night, Tom. Ellen\nwas saying the other day that we never see you any more.\"\n\nThe warden opened the door for his friend. \"I'll be out some night\nsoon,\" he promised, smiling.\n\nAs Williams stood waiting for the trusty to unlock the door of his\ncell, his eyes met those of Lawrie, the man in the next cell. Between\nthe two had grown up an active dislike, the more threatening because\nunspoken. At least, so far. It remained for Claffin, across the way,\nto bring the thing out into the open. They were all discussing an\nexpected arrival.\n\nSaid Claffin, \"I guess this new bird it plenty tough. He murdered his\nwife and two kids. That's even worse than 'cowboy' there.\"\n\nLawrie cut in sneeringly. \"I don't agree with you. He didn't carve 'em\nup afterwards like Williams did. Nobody in their right mind could do a\nthing like that. I couldn't, and neither could any of the rest of you\nfellows,\" he charged. No one answered. The others knew of the enmity\nbetween the two, and a strained silence filled the place. Then at\nlast, Williams spoke, his voice hoarse, fairly quivering with rage.\n\n\"All right, Lawrie, you've said plenty. I'll remember it. And don't\nforget this; you'll be next! You'll be next!\" he repeated, harshly.\nLawrie laughed, mockingly. The guard coming down the hall put a stop\nto further conversation for the time being. But now the quarrel\nbetween the two was out in the open, and through the following days\nand weeks, Lawrie seemed possessed of some imp of perversity and\ntaunted and gibed at Williams continuously. Much of the time, the\n'cowboy murderer' lay on his back on the cot and stared sullenly at\nthe ceiling, only turning at times to throw Lawrie a venomous glance.\nAt times, Lawrie grew ashamed for taunting a doomed man, but something\ninside of him, stronger than he, urged him on implacably. Once in a\nwhile, he shuddered at the looks given him by the other, and silently\nhe blessed the bars that kept them apart.\n\nThen came William's last morning. The prison chaplain came to\nadminister the last rites, but fled before the storm of curses that\nmet him. After his departure, a long silence fell that lasted till\nthey came for him. Even Lawrie was silent and sat soberly watching. As\nthey brought him out, and he passed Lawrie, he stopped and looked in.\nHis eyes, filled with immeasurable hatred, met those of Lawrie. On his\nface was a malignant sneer.\n\n\"Remember, you're next,\" he said slowly, and passed on down the\ncorridor. Lawrie watched his retreating form till it passed from\nsight. Claffin called across in a hoarse whisper. \"What do you make of\nthis; Williams asked them to bury him with his spurs on. Funny, isn't\nit?\"\n\nLawrie did not answer for the reason that at the word 'spurs,' a\nqueerly premonitory chill passed over him. Uneasily, he recalled the\nother's parting word and the cold, evil hatred of the other's glance.\nHe tried to shake off the cold, chilly feeling that was settling\nover him, but without success. There seemed to be an indefinable\nchange in the atmosphere, a sense of something horrible about to\nhappen. They all felt it, in a lesser degree. The gray day dragged\nalong, and conversation lagged. By common consent, they all avoided\nglancing at the empty cell. It seemed too potent a reminder of the\nthing that waited for them all. Dusk settled down and shadows began to\nfill the corners. And then Lawrie glancing idly out the door of his\ncell, gave a startled cry. There in the shadows before his cell door,\nhe saw something. A shadow that formed, that seemed to pause and\nlinger before him. Then, as he cried out, it melted into nothing and\nwas gone.\n\nHis heart was beating fast, pounding with the nameless fear that held\nhim in an ever-tightening grip. The sense of impending calamity drew\ncloser. He began to shake.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" called Claffin, curiously, his voice low.\n\nLawrie, eyes fastened on the empty cell next to him, did not answer.\nHe could not. He was watching something--something that formed before\nhis eyes into a man, a shadowy figure that smiled horribly and wore\ngleaming spurs. He saw it form, growing clearer and drawing nearer the\nbars. The shadowy eyes gazed back into his terrified ones, and then he\nscreamed at the thing he read in them. A scream that died in his\nthroat in a gurgle as he fell heavily.\n\nThe guard came running. \"What's going on here?\" he demanded, angrily.\nHe peered in suspiciously at the fallen figure. At last they entered\nthe silent cell and raised him to his cot. He was dead. And across the\nhorror that death had stamped indelibly on his face, there ran the\nlivid gash of a spur!\n\n\n\n\nABOUT AUTHORS\n\n\nClark Ashton Smith makes very little use of alliterations and has\nprobably invented more alien names for the characters in his stories\nthan any other author.... There are quite a few writers whose first\ninitials are E. E.... A few of them are: Speight, Smith, Repp,\nChappelow, and Newton.... Miss Leslie F. Stone was taken for a man,\neven after her picture had been printed in Wonder. Probably that is\nwhy a new one was drawn for \"The Hell Planet\" in the June, 1932\nnumber.... Jack Williamson wrote science fiction more than three years\nbefore he tackled weird stories, and now seems to be doing a good job\nat both.... Malcolm Afford's story, \"The Gland Men of the Island\" in\nWonder was printed in Amazing by mistake over two years later under\nthe name of \"The Ho-Ming Gland.\" This case shows to what extent the\neditors revise each story. Compare both stories and you will find many\nchanges of one over the other, especially at the conclusion ... Kaw,\nAnthos, and Marius: authors without first names.... Gernsback was the\nonly editor who imported foreign stories and translated them into\nEnglish for his science fiction publications. Fletcher Pratt, an\nauthor of note himself, usually does the translating.... Weird Tales\nhas had the largest number of authors who have never had a second\nstory appear.... How many are familiar with Bertram Atkey's fantastic\nstories in Blue Book? In 1930 he had a series of humorous\nreincarnation stories published there....\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nCome over to \"Our Readers Say\" and \"The Boiling Point\" and join in.\n\n\n\n\nTHE BOILING POINT\n\n\nThe Smith-Ackerman debate is still going strong, with Smith in the\nlead. However, the Ackerman side is taking a big leap with the\nfollowing defenses. The first comes from Allen Glasser, who says:\n\n\"I am surprised at the vicious remarks being made about Forrest\nAckerman. He really doesn't deserve any such abuse. Perhaps his\nwritings are a bit flamboyant and over-enthusiastic; but surely that's\nno great fault. To those who know him well, Forrest is a fine fellow;\nand his zeal for science-fiction merits praise rather than censure.\"\n\nDonald Alexander is all for Ackerman and wishes to make no secret of\nit:\n\n\"I've been watching the controversy in 'The Boiling Point.' It seems\nto me that young Forrest J. Ackerman is by far the most sensible of\nthe lot. Instead of intelligently answering his arguments, Messrs.\nSmith, Lovecraft, Barlow, etc., have made fools of themselves\ndescending to personalities. Ackerman is a most interesting type of\n'crank.' (Everyone who writes in to a magazine is a 'crank.' So'm I).\nAt least, F. J. A. shows signs of a rudimentary intelligence, which\nmost cranks don't. I agree with him. 'The Light from Beyond' and\nseveral other Smith yarns, had no place in _Wonder Stories_. WS\ncalls itself a science fiction magazine. Smith's story under\ndiscussion isn't science fiction, so, it had no place in such a\nmagazine. F. J. A. is right there. I see no reason why Lovecraft\nshould condemn Ackerman for not liking Smith. After all, we each have\nour own tastes. Smith, in my own opinion, is a poor writer. His\nstories are all like the ravings of some fearfully diseased mind.\nLovecraft, on the other hand, is a fairly good writer. But I'm wasting\ngood typewriter ink; your readers haven't enough intelligence to grasp\nsuch a common sense argument as the one presented by Ackerman, so they\ncall him a nitwit, while he actually has more sense than the lot of\nthem thrown together. If there were a hundred-million Forrest J.\nAckermans in the world, it'd be a better place to live in, at least\nwe'd have a little common sense used occasionally.\"\n\nNow, while we are very glad to find defenses on the Ackerman side,\nwe must disagree with Mr. Alexander when he calls our readers too\nignorant to grasp an argument put forth by Mr. Ackerman. Their eager\ndisapproval with logical objections contradicts this theory. And then\nagain, the mere fact that they are science fiction and weird fans puts\nthem above the average, for such readers must be broadminded and open\nminded, and not the \"What's-good-enough-for-father-is-good-enough-for-me\"\nor \"There-ain't-no-such-animal\" types. We believe that this letter\nleaves cause for rebuttal on the part of Messrs. Smith and Lovecraft.\n\nForrest J. Ackerman, of course, does not like the way he has been\ntreated, and has this to say about it:\n\n\"Pardon me, do; but why did you run 'The Boiling Point' in a foreign\nlanguage? What a vocalberry on those Weird Men Smith and Lovecraft!\nAnd I think I'll have to change my tag from 'Forrest J. Ackerman,\nScientifictionist' to 'Forrest J. Ackerman, Ebullitionist'. The two\ngot the word in within the first line of comments. Now Mr. Smith will\nbe calling Mr. Lovecraft 'Plagiarist', and then maybe Mr. Smith (the\n'Skylark') will burst in and say that HE owns the original. Let's have\na contest... Just thought of it--the original Paul illustration that I\ntreasure _would_ be from _Smith's_ story, 'The City of the Singing\nFlame.' I don't get the connection: the Lovecraft says in print 'a\nvery childish attack', and in his personal reply to me 'your bright\nand candid letter.'!?\"\n\nIt can be seen by the above letter that Ackerman really holds no hard\nfeeling toward the Weird Men; just a bit of mockery and rare Ackerman\nwit.\n\nJust to show that we are always open to both sides, following are a\ncouple of fans who still choose to 'lay it on thick.'\n\n\"Personally, I thought that 'The Light From Beyond' was very good, and\nI certainly could see nothing weird about it. It was fantasy, yes, and\nnot stf, but some of the greatest classics of so-called science\nfiction have been almost pure fantasy. Witness: 'The Snake Mother,'\n'The Moon Pool,' 'The Time Stream' (Ackerman's objection to this was\nparticularly obnoxious to me, as I thought it was one of the best\nstories ever written. Certainly it offered the most food for thought),\n'The Skylark of Space' (partly fantasy), 'The Princess of Mars,' and\nother greats. Certainly, there should be something more to science\nfiction than rays, machines, villains, heroines, (composed of lipstick\nand legs, as Mr. Barlow rather bitterly expresses it) as has been\nstressed so greatly of late. There should be an element of fantasy,\nstrong character, and a well-developed plot in addition. The lack of\nthose is why so many weird story lovers (like Mr. Barlow) can find so\nmuch fault with stf. I do not blame him. I, myself, as a reader, will\nstop reading stf when the fantasy element is dropped completely.\"\nWilliam Crawford (Editor of _Unusual Stories_).\n\n\"What does this Ackerman guy know about weird and fantastic fiction?\nFrom the way he writes, he must be an unimaginative person unable to\nstretch his mind away from space-ships and foreign star-clusters. I\nget that he is an egotistical radical and one who doesn't like\nsomething that is not even intended for him. So far, in telling about\nhis collection, he has described a sort of madhouse. However, I\ncertainly would like to see this madhouse, as I can appreciate a thing\nor two that is connected with stf. At heart, I am truly a weird and\nfantastic fiction fan.\"--F. Lee Baldwin\n\nThere seems to be enough controversy in this month's discussion to\nbring in enough letters to fill next month's. Write in and give us\nyour opinions on the subject. Are Smith's tales fit for _Wonder\nStories_? Does Ackerman know what he's talking about, and are the\nWeird Men justified in their criticisms of him?

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
