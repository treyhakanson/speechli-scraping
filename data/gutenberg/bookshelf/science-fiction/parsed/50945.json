You act as if you were ready to\nattack Donner with your bare hands.\" The president of the Research\nFoundation removed an expensive cigar from its plastic cocoon and lit\nit from young Taplin's eagerly offered lighter.\n\nHalleck sat down. \"Sorry, G. W. This business has me on edge. I feel\nresponsible for Donner's activities--and for the missing $300,000, too.\nThe whole thing reeks of larceny.\"\n\n\"You _are_ responsible, Hal.\" The president's tone was crisp but not\naccusing. \"That's what a general manager gets paid for. Isn't it time\nDonner showed up?\"\n\n\"He's to be here at ten, Mr. Caples. The girl will buzz us as soon\nas he comes in.\" Orville Taplin was a very good secretary, but his\neagerness to prove it sometimes irked his superiors. \"Shall I order\nsome coffee sent up, Mr. Caples?\"\n\n\"Not just now. Look, Hal, have you checked on this Simon Kane that\nDonner mentions in his letter? He doesn't sound quite real. Do we know\nif there is such a person?\"\n\nTaplin interrupted the general manager to answer the question.\n\"Yes, sir. There really is a Simon Kane. I talked to Dr. Reed by\ntransatlantic telephone last night. He said Kane was public relations\nman on his first expedition to Egypt in 1958.\"\n\n\"Why the blazes didn't you let _me_ talk to him?\" Halleck was on his\nfeet again, a sharp-faced, balding man with a temper that suggested\nulcers. \"G. W., I--\"\n\n\"Forget it, Hal! What else, young man?\"\n\n\"Well, Dr. Reed said he fired him at the request of the Egyptian\ngovernment and sent him back to the States. He said it was a long story\nand he didn't want to get into it on the phone.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLeaning across the wide mahogany desk and tapping the blotter for\nemphasis, Halleck said, \"Look, G. W., Kane doesn't matter. He's just a\nname. The Utah Flats plant is short $300,000. Let Donner explain it in\ncourt. If Kane or anyone else was involved, let Donner prove it.\"\n\nThe buzzer wheezed and Orville Taplin's finger shot to the key. \"Yes?\"\n\n\"Mr. Donner is here.\"\n\nG. W. Caples nodded to the question in the secretary's face. \"Send him\nin.\"\n\nThe man in the doorway was tall, sandy and rather stooped for early\nmiddle age. His straight lined features looked competent, but the mouth\nwas compressed to a narrow hyphen, as if he had lived through this\nordeal many times in anticipation and always come out of it badly. His\ngray business suit was wrinkled with travel.\n\n\"Good morning, Mr. Caples. Gentlemen.\"\n\nAlthough he closed the door gently, the click of it sounded loud in the\nsilence. \"I hope I'm not late.\"\n\n\"Right on the dot, Ray. Glad to see you. Pick a comfortable chair.\" The\npresident smoothed the crumpled letter in front of him on the desk and\nwaved the silent Halleck to a seat. \"You can order that coffee now,\nyoung man.\"\n\nWhen Taplin had called for the coffee and started the recording\nmachine, G. W. Caples addressed the newcomer again with heavy,\nexecutive affability. It was authentic enough to ease the watch-spring\ntension in the room.\n\n\"Before we start, Ray, keep it in mind that this isn't a trial or\nanything like that. I, for one, have an open mind. If your record\nhadn't been beyond reproach, you wouldn't be a research plant manager\nin the first place.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"But your letter here mentions an unauthorized experiment that cost\n$300,000, a missing man--two missing men, in fact--your fear of ugly\npublicity and--well, various other details that leave me thoroughly\nconfused. Now, you're going to give us all the facts--not as a culprit,\nbut as a trusted official.\"\n\n\"I appreciate that, sir. Shall I begin at the beginning?\"\n\n\"Yes. Forget the letter. Begin where you like.\"\n\n\"Well, first, you know Dr. Wilson Reed, the archeologist. Top man in\nthe field. He made the Yucatan discoveries and located the Poseidon\nTablets in the vaults under the Sphinx--the newspapers called him the\n'Columbus of the Past.' But I don't need to tell you that. This all\nbegan with a letter I had from Dr. Reed shortly after he left for his\nsecond expedition to Egypt.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCaples nodded. \"I know his reputation, but I never met the man.\"\n\n\"That's one of the many things I don't understand, Mr. Caples.\" Raymond\nDonner sat on the edge of the leather lounge chair and kneaded his\nlong, thin hands. \"You see, the letter asked me to cooperate with Simon\nKane in every way and there was an interoffice memo from you enclosed,\ninstructing me to do so, written in your own handwriting.\"\n\nCaples leaned across the desk, startled. \"A memo from _me_! Now see\nhere, Ray--Where is the memo? Where's the letter?\"\n\n\"They're gone, Mr. Caples. They were stolen.\"\n\nThe buzzer sounded and a cheerful redhead brought in a tray with\nfour cups, cream and sugar bowls and a large aluminum coffee urn. It\nremained untouched on the desk when she had gone.\n\n\"I see. They were stolen.\" The president's casual manner was gone and\nthe tension returned unchecked. \"Go on.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, sir. But the letter and memo were the keys to the whole\nbusiness. And I want to remind you at the beginning that I'm not a\nscientist or an aviation engineer, but an administrative officer--\"\n\n\"Maybe we should say you _were_.\"\n\n\"Shut up, Halleck! Let him go on.\"\n\nThe president glanced at the recorder spinning silently and drew short,\nangry puffs on his cigar.\n\n\"And I want to remind you, too, gentlemen, that I'm here of my own\nvolition. My fears are for the Foundation's reputation, not for myself\nalone. After all, there's no motive for murder and--\"\n\n\"Murder!\" The two executives looked frozen. Taplin, starting to reach\nfor the coffee, changed his mind.\n\n\"--and, to put it bluntly, no dead body. But let me take it from the\nbeginning.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"As I said, the letter and memo came in May, just after Dr. Reed left\nfor Egypt again. A week after that, Simon Kane phoned from Salt Lake\nCity to make an appointment for the following afternoon.\n\n\"He turned out to be a dark-featured, very distinguished type in his\nlate forties. His eyes were an intense black, heavily browed and,\nthough he wasn't big, his voice was deep and arrestingly modulated.\nListening to him, it was easy to lose track of what he was saying. His\nmouth was wide and--well, sympathetic.\n\n\"We talked for about an hour that first day, mostly about Dr. Reed's\nmarvelous discovery in Egypt. Kane said the Poseidon Tablets described\na magnificent civilization, scientifically advanced, that had\nflourished on an equatorial continent until it was destroyed by the\nBiblical Flood--around 10,700 B.C.\n\n\"He spoke of Dr. Reed as an intimate friend and said he had been\ngreatly impressed with you, Mr. Caples.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe president scowled. \"I've never heard of the man. But it seems\npretty strange that he should have turned up when Halleck was in Persia\nand I was in Europe on atomic-inspection duty and Reed was off to\nEgypt.\"\n\n\"Looking back at it, I agree with you,\" said Donner, taking out a\ncigarette and lighting it. \"But it didn't occur to me at the time.\"\n\n\"Well, get on with it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"If I could give you a better idea of Kane's remarkable voice, its\nhypnotic quality--but I guess I can't. Maybe that's just an excuse. I\nwish I'd thrown him out of the office the first day.\n\n\"When we got around to the reason for his call, he asked if there was\nany chance of our being overheard. I assured him there wasn't and he\ntold me his weird story.\n\n\"It seemed Dr. Reed had found another series of fourteen tablets along\nwith the others, but these hadn't been publicized. A translation of the\nfirst half dozen showed that they concerned an outstanding--perhaps the\nultimate--scientific achievement of the Poseidon civilization: a small\nsolar energy converter, able to deliver such fantastic power that it\nmade our nuclear sources look as primitive as the windmill.\n\n\"When I said the invention wouldn't be very welcome in a country where\nthe entire economy was geared to atomic power, Kane agreed and said\nthat explained the secrecy. He said you, Mr. Caples, and Dr. Reed felt\nthe device should be tested under wraps and then turned over to the\ngovernment, since private ownership of a dirt-cheap power source--if it\nworked--might precipitate economic chaos.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nG. W. Caples sat stiffly in the same position. \"The whole idea is pure\nnonsense, the most transparent fraud. A child wouldn't swallow it.\"\n\n\"You may be right. It was my misfortune not to be a child.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Simon Kane made it sound completely plausible. He said two good\nmen could build the gadget in a month. He agreed to bring the\nspecifications to my office the next morning and I showed him out,\nfeeling very excited about the thing. I had a lot to learn about Mr.\nKane.\n\n\"In the morning, I called in Ruhl and Heiniger and told them they\nwere to work on a project involving 100% security. They agreed, of\ncourse. The hush-hush jobs are usually the most interesting. Then Kane\ncame in with his sheets of specifications and gave them the details.\nTheir faces were--I was going to say like children viewing their first\nChristmas tree.\n\n\"Since it was all Greek to me, I left the three of them to discuss the\nproject and went off about some other business. Kane was gone when\nI got back and had left a note inviting me out to his house for a\ncocktail or two that afternoon.\n\n\"When I could get away, I drove out to his place, a great, sprawling\nranchhouse he'd rented a few miles from the plant. No one else was\nthere, but Kane was an ingratiating host and a couple of hours passed\nvery pleasantly. I kept wondering why he wanted such a big place, way\nout in the hills, just for himself.\n\n\"Around five, I phoned Ruhl at the plant. He's rather a stolid type\nordinarily, but he was stuttering with excitement. He said the power\nunit was revolutionary and might change the course of history.\n\n\"Kane laughed when I repeated that to him. 'Maybe it already did,' he\nsaid. 'A few thousand years ago.'\"\n\n\"We shook hands at the door and agreed to meet the next morning and get\nto work.\n\n\"As I was walking along the house toward the drive where my car stood,\na movement at one of the windows near the end of the building caught my\neye. I paused and looked up--into the face of one of the most beautiful\nwomen I've ever seen.\n\n\"She was youngish, not over 27 or 28, pale in coloring with rich,\nblack hair piled up behind her neck. The large, dark eyes were looking\nsquarely into mine. I must have stopped and stared for several seconds,\nfor, in addition to her beauty, I thought I saw a great dread written\nin the girl's face. Then she was gone.\n\n\"All the way home, I kept wondering why Simon Kane hadn't mentioned the\nwoman in his house. The silly thought that she was being held captive\nthere kept coming to me, no matter how often I dismissed it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCaples poured a cup of coffee and made a face when he sipped it.\n\"Donner, I don't know why you have to ornament this yarn with\nhypnotic-voiced villains and captive girls. Can't you just tell us if\nyour expensive gadget worked?\"\n\nHalleck slumped glumly. Taplin fluttered over the cold coffee and\nordered some more.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"The device _did_ work, Mr. Caples. I set Ruhl and Heiniger up in the\nisolated shop at the west corner of the plant area and they had it\nfunctioning in three weeks. We brought in a skilled glass-cutter to\nform the big, faceted eye to receive the Sun's radiations. Naturally,\nhe didn't know what it was for.\n\n\"By the time the eye was ready, they'd assembled the conversion\nelements. They rigged the thing to deliver electrical current through a\nseries of step-down transformers. The result was appalling. Until the\ncurrent was reduced to a tiny fraction of the potential, it blew out\nevery testing gauge they plugged into it.\n\n\"Up to this time, I think all three of us--Heiniger, Ruhl and\nmyself--had been kept hopped up by curiosity and Kane's infectious\nconfidence. Now it was evident that something incredible had been\nproduced. Think of it--two men could lift the converter between them,\nyet its potential was as great as any atomic pile we have!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"It sounds crazy.\" Caples was getting restless. \"Are you sure you\ndidn't dream all this, Donner?\"\n\n\"That story will sound great in court--but it doesn't account for the\n$300,000.\" Halleck's laugh was thin, with no amusement in it.\n\nThe buzzer sounded. \"Here's your hot coffee, Mr. Caples,\" said Taplin.\nWhen the girl had gone again, Donner continued patiently, speaking in\nHalleck's direction without anger.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"So far, we had spent less than three thousand dollars, including\nsalaries, materials, overhead, everything. The experiment seemed to be\nfinished. I wrote up my report and showed it to Kane before filing it\nin the project folder with Reed's letter and the memo and everything\nelse concerned. I supposed Kane would be on his way east and I'd be\nexpected to verify his statement of the results. But he didn't come in\nto say good-by.\n\n\"One morning, I stopped in at the isolated shop and found Heiniger\nstill working with the power unit. Naturally, I asked what he was doing.\n\n\"'Getting it ready to mount in the projectile, Mr. Donner,' he said.\n\n\"I said, '_What_ projectile?'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Then he explained how Kane (and I) had leased a surplus one-man\nrocket from the White Sands Project and that he and Ruhl were to rig\nthe solar unit in it. Rather than let Heiniger know something was\nwrong, though I felt like blowing my top, I asked him how on Earth an\nelectrical plant could power a rocket.\n\n\"'There's nothing to it,' he said. 'It's all in Mr. Kane's translations\nof those tablets of his.'\"\n\n\"I was beginning to wonder if this was really happening or if I _was_\ndreaming. Heiniger described some sort of method for setting up a\nmagnetic field in _front_ of the rocket so that it could be _pulled_,\nrather than pushed, at almost any speed through the atmosphere that the\npilot wished--five, ten, twelve thousand miles an hour--whatever the\npilot could take.\n\n\"It was hard to believe an experienced man like Heiniger would swallow\nthat. I said, 'It's ridiculous! The skin would melt!'\n\n\"'Oh, no,' said Heiniger. 'Mr. Kane has the formula for an alloy that\nwon't melt at any speed in atmosphere. His tablets tell how it was\nused way back there for the same kind of flight. He's having a special\nsheath of it made for the rocket in Santa Fe.'\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPresident Caples stabbed his cigar into the ashtray. \"Donner,\" he said,\n\"what do you take us for? You're making it almost impossible for the\nFoundation to back you up, coming in here with such a fairy story.\"\n\nRaymond Donner seemed to shrink in his clothes and he slumped deep\nin his chair. \"I _know_ how it sounds. I'm a fool--I admit it. But\nHeiniger isn't, nor Ruhl. They were convinced they were working on the\nmodern world's first practical spaceship.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I left the plant with my head spinning and drove out to Simon Kane's\nplace. I was determined not to go any farther with this without\nauthority from you, even if I had to chase you all over Europe.\n\n\"When I reached the house, Kane's car was in the driveway. He met me on\nthe patio and pushed me inside before I could say my piece. There was a\nyoung man in the drawing room whom he introduced as Porter Hays. He was\na handsome chap in his middle twenties with cropped, blond hair and an\nengaging candor about him. I guessed he was a flier by the recklessness\nabout his mouth and eyes. He seemed very excited.\n\n\"They took me to a table spread with photographs and typed sheets and,\nfor the first time, I saw pictures of the original tablets. The typed\nsheets were translations.\n\n\"'Porter has agreed to fly the ship,' said Kane, as if I knew all about\nthat. 'He's with the Pan-Columbian Project and has flown all the other\ntypes that have been developed so far.'\n\n\"'But this is the one that will make history, Mr. Donner!' I looked at\nHays closely and saw that he meant it. 'This will fly anywhere in our\nsolar system--and probably clear out to most others--without carrying a\nfuel supply. And the best thing about it is the absolute guarantee of a\nreturn trip. Those geniuses down at Pan-Columbia have plenty of ideas\nfor getting you out there, but very few for getting you back.'\n\n\"I realized the Simon Kane magic had been at work on the young man. He\nwas sold completely and--considering the possibilities and that he was\nwilling to risk his life on them--the objections I intended to make\nseemed rather puny at the time. Still, I was about to ask Kane to see\nme in private when the young pilot spoke up.\n\n\"He said, 'Say, Mr. Kane, where's the last tablet? There are only\nphotos of thirteen here.'\n\n\"'Why, that's right,' Kane said. 'I forgot to mention it. The first\nthirteen take us through the construction of the unit and the ship and\nthe inventor's successful trial flights. Number fourteen hasn't been\ntranslated yet--it takes about a month to decipher each tablet.'\n\n\"Porter Hays had a disarming way of asking anything he wanted to know.\n'And who does it? Do you, Mr. Kane?'\n\n\"'No. That is, it's a special gift, takes years of study--'\n\n\"'Then who _does_ decipher them?'\n\n\"'Well, you see--' It was the first time I'd seen Simon Kane uneasy and\nat a loss for words. 'My wife does it. She's Egyptian, a scholar in her\nown right, daughter of one of Egypt's foremost antiquarians.'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Hays insisted upon meeting her and, although Kane tried every evasion,\nhe finally left the room and was gone quite a while. During the wait, I\ntalked with young Hays and confirmed my high opinion of him. I wondered\nhow he'd react to Mrs. Kane if she turned out to be the beautiful girl\nI'd seen in the window a few weeks earlier.\n\n\"I soon found out, for Kane came back leading the girl by the hand.\nI might have said 'dragging,' but it wasn't quite that obvious. At\ncloser view, wearing a sort of chiton-draped white dress, she was even\nmore lovely than I'd thought. The long lashes veiled her eyes, except\nwhen she acknowledged Kane's introductions with a quick glance and a\nmurmured, 'How do you do.' Her name was Nalja.\n\n\"Hays was obviously impressed and, in his uninhibited way, said, 'Good\nLord, Kane! If I had a dream like this at home, I wouldn't hide her.\nI'd keep her out on display to make the other guys jealous.'\n\n\"The girl gave him a grateful look and just a flicker of a smile, but\nsaid nothing.\n\n\"Simon Kane's reaction was curious. The color drained from his face\nand hostile was the only word for his expression. Then he seemed to\nget under control and became his genial self. 'My dear,' he said to\nhis wife, 'we thought you could give a hint about the text of the\nfourteenth tablet. Are you far enough along?'\n\n\"Her voice was low and throaty, with a slight British accent. 'I'm\nsorry. I have only just started.'\n\n\"'Have you no idea what it's about?'\n\n\"'Only that it seems to be some sort of testimonial. The language\nsymbols are a little different than the others and it's difficult to\nread.'\n\n\"Then she was gone and Porter Hays stood looking at the door through\nwhich she had passed, as if he had just seen a vision.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Wait a minute, Donner,\" Caples cut in. \"How's that tape holding out,\nyoung man?\"\n\n\"Fine, Mr. Caples. At least an hour more to go.\"\n\n\"All right. Go ahead, Donner. Can't you leave out some of the side\nissues and get to the finish of this?\"\n\n\"They're all related to the outcome of the matter, Mr. Caples. It\nwouldn't make any sense at all without them.\"\n\n\"Nor with them,\" said Halleck sourly, staring out the window.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Kane was to drive Hays back to Salt Lake, so I only had a moment alone\nwith him. When I told him I wanted to hold up everything until I'd\nchecked with my superiors, he just laughed it off. He said that you,\nMr. Caples, had seen all thirteen translations and your memo covered\nthe whole works. I'm sorry to say this convinced me.\n\n\"Next day, a carload of equipment came in for testing and I didn't\nsee Simon Kane for about a week, though I learned things weren't\ngoing so well. There was some trouble with the alloy. The rocket was\nshipped in, though, and turned out to be a very recent model with the\nlatest developments in shock and pressure compensation, oxygen plant,\nhoming-beam navigation and all that. The credit to White Sands was only\n$32,000, including insurance, so I authorized it without misgivings,\nfiguring that the persuasive Kane had swung a good deal.\n\n\"Ruhl got back from Santa Fe and said they'd licked the alloy problem,\nthough it had been hard to avoid publicity. The metal could only be\nworked in a molten state, so the fabricator was casting the nose\nsheath and three overlapping girdles with rivet holes, also rivets and\nfin shields of the same stuff. It sounded heavy to me, but Ruhl said\nthat would eliminate all possibility of vibration. This metal casting\naccounted for most of the $300,000.\n\n\"During the next two weeks, I was too busy with other things to worry\nmuch about the project, but two incidents happened that had a bearing\non it.\n\n\"On a visit to Salt Lake, I was dining at the Pioneer Arms one evening\nand spotted Porter Hays at a table across the room. He was with a young\nlady who looked familiar to me, even from the back. They were deep in\nconversation. Hays looked up and saw me just as the waiter brought my\ndinner. His expression was far from friendly. When the waiter moved out\nof the way, I looked over and saw that Hays and the girl were gone.\n\n\"A little later, a bellboy brought me a note. It read, 'I expect you'll\nbe guided by your own ideas of honor in a case like this. But if you\ncan conscientiously keep your goddam mouth shut, you may help to\ncorrect a great injustice. Hays.'\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCaples had joined Halleck at the window. Now he interrupted. \"I suppose\nthis note and the bill of lading on the rocket were stolen, too?\"\n\n\"I tore up that note myself, Mr. Caples. The bill of lading,\nthough--the second incident concerns it.\"\n\nYoung Taplin had begun to fidget.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"On July 19, Kane telephoned and said the airship was all rigged\nand ready to go. He had chosen a spot in the desert for the test\nand had scheduled it for the next morning. He'd engaged an expert\ncommunications man--a friend of Ruhl's--and the ship and all ground\nequipment were loaded on a trailer under canvas, ready to leave at\nnightfall. Ruhl, Heiniger and the radio man would ride out there\ntogether in the trailer.\n\n\"I was irked not to have been consulted on the arrangements. Kane\nwanted me to pick up Porter Hays and follow the trailer out, saying\nhe'd be delayed, but would be there at dawn. I told him I had an\nappointment for dinner--some government brass--but would be there in\ntime for the test.\n\n\"Kane seemed to become furious at this. He railed about the lack of\ncooperation and how he'd had to work out the details of the project\nalmost single-handed, in spite of a clear directive from my superiors.\nIt ended by my hanging up on him.\n\n\"Driving home around eleven that night, I passed the plant and noticed\na light burning in the darkened office building. Before I reached the\ngate, it struck me that the light was from my own office. The guard\nat the gate had just come on duty, but his clip-board had no incoming\nsignatures on it. So I went to take a look. I turned the knob of my\noffice door and Kane was standing by the desk with his briefcase in one\nhand and his hat in the other.\n\n\"I was shocked at the change in him. His eyes were sunken and deeply\nrimmed with shadow. He looked ten years older than the last time I'd\nseen him.\n\n\"But he wasn't at all abashed. He walked around the desk and took my\nhand, saying, 'Raymond, I've been waiting here an hour. Felt sure you'd\nstop by. Wanted to apologize in private for my disgraceful performance\nthis afternoon.'\n\n\"Kane must have seen I wasn't satisfied. 'The strain of this\nundertaking has been greater than you realize,' he added. 'So much is\nat stake, such a great responsibility to Dr. Reed, your foundation, the\nwhole world--'\n\n\"I mumbled something about forget it and told him to come along to my\nplace for a bracer and we'd ride out to the site together. But he said\nhe had a couple of matters to attend to and we parted at the plant\ngate.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHalleck came back and sat down. Caples took his seat at the desk.\n\"I have a feeling,\" he said, \"that we are about to learn if this\nprehistoric spaceship of yours ever got off the ground.\"\n\n\"Shall I order some more coffee, Mr. Caples?\" asked Taplin eagerly.\n\n\"No. Just shut up, you idiot! Are you too young to appreciate this\nbreathless, _undocumented_ melodrama Mr. Donner's describing for us?\nThis last incident explains the lack of documentation, doesn't it,\nDonner?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid it does. I discovered later that the folder with all the\npapers relating to the project was missing from my files, but I have\nother evidence to offer--a witness.\" He glanced at his wristwatch. \"If\nmy witness is prompt, I'll just have time to finish this.\"\n\n\"Please do! Does the next scene take place at the launching site?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Yes. I got there a little late--missed the turn off the highway and\nwent a long way past it. When I found the place, everything was ready\nand they were waiting for me.\n\n\"The aircraft lay on its side, looking fat and very ungainly, I\nthought, because of its increased girth. Porter Hays seemed tense, but\neager to get on with it. He wore no flight garb except his helmet with\nthe earphones. Standing there in slacks and sweater, smoking a final\ncigarette, he didn't look theatrical enough for such an occasion. I\nthought of telling him I'd kept my goddam mouth shut, but didn't get a\nchance.\n\n\"The plan was to take the ship up a few hundred feet and jockey around\nto test everything. If the equipment and ship were all right, Hays\nwould whip her up a few hundred miles and cruise at his discretion.\nThere was to be no long flight that day. Since we were far out of the\ntraffic lanes, we didn't expect to attract any attention.\n\n\"At last the Sun came up full, there was a final conference, and Hays\nclimbed into the ship's rotating cabin by the door at the rear. He\nwaved and shut the door. He could see out with his tele-view of course,\nbut we couldn't see him.\n\n\"While the radio man checked the ship-to-ground contact, the rest of us\nmoved back out of habit, though there would be no blast here.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Very slowly, the ship raised itself to a vertical position. It rose\ngradually to about ten feet, stopped, then shot up a couple of hundred\nand stopped again. It was incredible!\n\n\"'Give me the phone,' said Kane. He was as white as paste and his eyes\nwere fever-bright. 'How's it doing, Hays? Looked good from here. Is she\npowering right?'\n\n\"The answer must have been gratifying because Simon Kane's white teeth\nflashed when he heard it.\n\n\"After that, the ship bobbed around in swift dashes, stopping, then\ndarting upward till it was only a dot, reaching unbelievable speeds.\nAll this time, Kane was talking with Hays on the phone, asking\nquestions, suggesting new maneuvers. Though he was trembling with\nexcitement, his voice was calm, controlled and persuasive. I realized\nlater that he was egging Hays on to try more and more spectacular tests\nof the ship.\n\n\"Suddenly it shot away in a steep climb toward the west and was out of\nsight in a matter of seconds. Kane laid down the telephone and turned\nto me.\n\n\"'He's satisfied the craft works perfectly,' he said. 'He's going to\ntake it straight out for four or five hours and then come back.'\n\n\"We all stared at him, for Hays wasn't to have stayed up over an hour.\nI said, 'He can't do that. There's too much he doesn't know about the\nship. Tell him to come back!'\n\n\"Kane didn't look at me. 'The boy knows his business. Leave him alone.\nHe's making history.'\n\n\"'But the first time--'\n\n\"'I'm going down the road a few miles to get some breakfast. Take turns\ntalking to him, why don't you?'\n\n\"He got in his car and drove off.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Exit the villain! Donner, you've got a talent, but you're in the wrong\nline of work.\" G. W. Caples dug a chubby fore-finger under his collar\nand worked the tie knot loose. \"This scenario is worth every single\ncent of $300,000.\"\n\nRaymond Donner's mouth pressed a little tighter and his tongue pushed\nthrough to moisten his gray dry lips.\n\n\"He never came back,\" he said hoarsely. \"And neither did Hays.\"\n\nSomething in the man's voice stopped the president from going on with\nhis sarcastic attack.\n\n\"Did the ship crash?\" he asked more soberly.\n\n\"No. It just flew away and never came back.\"\n\nThe silence hung like a shroud. All three of them--even the\nself-conscious Taplin--stared at Donner.\n\n\"We talked to Porter Hays in turns. We begged him to come back. But he\njust laughed and said he was having the ride of his life. After about\ntwo hours, his voice faded out suddenly--and that was the end of it.\"\n\n\"How long ago was this?\"\n\n\"Four days.\"\n\n\"Have you notified the authorities, the police or--well, anyone?\"\n\n\"No. I've been putting it off. You see, Hays gave us no hint of any\ntrouble. The others are still sitting out there in the desert waiting\nfor him, trying to make radio contact. The ship carried a standard\nsurvival kit with seven days' rations and water. If he's had no\noperational trouble, Hays could stay out at least a week.\"\n\n\"And what about Simon Kane?\" demanded Caples.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"When Kane didn't come back by noon, I went to look for him.\n\n\"On the way to his home, I stopped at the office, on a hunch, and\ndiscovered the records were missing. At last it began to penetrate that\nthere was something rotten in Denmark.\n\n\"Dusk had fallen and there were no lights in the Kane house when I got\nthere. No one answered the doorbell. I called and pounded and finally\nclimbed in a window to look for signs that the Kanes had packed and\nleft. There were none. Everything was in order.\n\n\"Then, as I was leaving, I heard a knocking sound from the end of the\nbuilding and traced it to the last room on the west side, a sort of\nstudy. The knocking came from a locked closet. The key was gone, so I\nhad to smash the door.\n\n\"Nalja Kane was sitting on the floor, staring at me without seeming to\nsee me. She looked frightful, with her hair awry and her eyes red and\nglassy.\n\n\"She sort of moaned as I helped her up. 'Did it happen? Did he fly the\nship?'\n\n\"I said, 'Yes, but something's wrong. Where is your husband?'\n\n\"The girl seemed to go all to pieces, turning her head from side to\nside and repeating, 'Oh, no! Oh, no!' Then she collapsed.\n\n\"I drove her to the hotel in the nearest town and called a doctor I\nknew. He said she had emotional exhaustion, needed rest rather than\nhospital care, and gave her a strong sedative. When I got home, I\nstayed awake long enough to write that letter to you and then fell into\nbed.\n\n\"The phone woke me around ten the next morning. It was Ruhl, calling\nfrom a gas station on the highway. He said Hays wasn't back yet and\npromised to call again at five.\n\n\"I mulled the whole thing over all day, trying to sort out the facts,\nbut they just wouldn't add up to anything. When Ruhl called again with\nthe same bad news, I decided to come on east and get it off my chest.\nIt's all beyond me. I don't know what to do.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDonner searched in his pockets and pulled out a cigarette pack. It was\nempty and he crumpled it absently. Halleck patted his own pockets but\ncouldn't find any.\n\n\"Now take it easy, Ray,\" said Caples, walking around the desk with the\nhumidor and holding it open. \"This is the weirdest thing I've ever\nheard--yet I think I believe you. Leave it to you solid types to foul\nup on a grand scale! How about this witness you mentioned?\"\n\n\"On the train--I wanted more time to think, so I didn't fly here--it\noccurred to me how flimsy this would all sound, without your memo or\nanything else to back it up. I couldn't even prove the tablets ever\nexisted. In Chicago, I phoned Nalja Kane. She was much better and quite\ncalm. When I told her the spot I was in, she agreed to take a plane in\nthe morning and try to be here at 11:30 today.\"\n\nTaplin's finger darted to the key panel, but Caples brushed him aside\nand opened the circuit himself. \"This is Mr. Caples. Is there a lady in\nthe outer office?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Mrs. Simon Kane.\"\n\n\"Ask her to step in, please.\"\n\nThe four men rose before the door opened--Donner, slowly, with great\nweariness. She stood a moment, looking from one face to another, cool\nand regal in summer white with a small flowered hat. Faint purple\ncircles gave her black eyes a brilliance.\n\nRaymond Donner took her hand and led her to a chair. \"Thank you for\ncoming, Mrs. Kane. May I present Mr. Caples and Mr. Halleck, my\nsuperiors--and Mr. Taplin.\"\n\nWhen they were seated, she spoke first in her low, passionate voice,\nwithout waiting for questions. \"I will tell you what I know of Simon\nKane, gentlemen, though it may be less than you would expect from a\nwife. In return, I ask you to use all your influence to find him and\nbring him to justice. He is a monster and a murderer!\"\n\n\"You have my word on it, Mrs. Kane,\" said Caples, \"if you can supply\nthe evidence that crimes have been committed. Taplin--the recorder.\nMove it closer.\"\n\nAs she began to speak, an occasional small break in her voice hinted at\nthe emotional turbulence the girl was holding in tight rein.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I married Simon Kane in Egypt in 1958. We met through my father, who\nrepresented the Egyptian government on Dr. Reed's excavation project.\nAt first, Simon was charming and devoted. We left Egypt almost at once\nand entered upon a very pleasant, if secluded, life in this country.\nThe only discordant note was my father's obvious dislike for Simon. His\nletters were stiff and infrequent, and finally stopped altogether.\n\n\"One day, after we had lived here about three years, my husband brought\nhome two heavy cases and called me in when he opened them. These cases\ncontained the fourteen tablets that Mr. Donner has probably mentioned.\nSimon told me Dr. Reed had turned them over to him to be deciphered.\n\n\"I knew at once that this was not true, since Dr. Reed is one of the\nworld's foremost students of ancient writings and would have prized the\ntablets too highly to let my husband carry them around in his car. When\nSimon asked me to make the translations, I refused.\n\n\"He became nearly insane with rage and finally told me he had persuaded\nmy father to help him steal them a few weeks before our wedding. If I\ndid not agree to translate them, he threatened to expose my father and\ndisgrace him before the world. So I did as Simon demanded and it killed\nmy love for him.\n\n\"In his twisted, possessive way, I think my husband continued to love\nme. Once the translation was under way, he tried very hard to win my\nvoluntary cooperation. He said the device described in the tablets\nwould upset the economy of the entire world. The government and\nindustry, he claimed, would pay any price he asked for suppressing it,\nonce it was tested and proved. We would live like royalty. But I told\nhim that, if not for my father, I would expose him without the least\nhesitation.\n\n\"When we moved to Utah, Simon found an isolated house for us and I was\nvirtually a prisoner.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNalja Kane stopped. The danger signals of emotion breaking through\nshowed in the swift, anxious breathing. The four men studied her\nhelplessly and then it was Taplin who got the glass of water that\nbridged a difficult moment. She went on.\n\n\"The first day you came to our house, Mr. Donner, I wrote a note of\nwarning. I intended to hand it to you through the window, but Simon\ncame into the room behind me and I couldn't.\"\n\n\"I'm so sorry, Mrs. Kane. You were obviously in trouble. I should\nhave--\"\n\n\"Perhaps it was better. It might have cost you your life to cross Simon\nat that point.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Anyway, Porter Hays stopped by one day. My husband was out and I\nanswered the door. He was a fine man, sensitive and kind, considering\nhis adventurous temperament. He could see I was nervous--you know the\ndisarming way he had of asking the most personal questions.\n\n\"I was afraid to talk there and asked him to drive me to Salt Lake.\nOn the way, I told him the whole story. He was very sympathetic and\npromised to help--beginning by trying to contact my father. I hoped\nhe would refuse to fly the ship when he knew about Simon. But he had\nabsolute confidence in it and no fear at all. His plan was to complete\nthe test and then ask you, Mr. Donner, to impound the ship and all the\nrecords on it.\n\n\"The day before the test flight, I put in the time completing the\ntranslation of the fourteenth tablet.\n\n\"Simon had shown no interest in this, believing it to be a summary of\nthe others. As the sense of it began to emerge, I was horrified. By\nmidnight, I had finished it and I sat down in the drawing room with a\ntyped copy in my hand, waiting for my husband. I waited all night and\nmust have fallen asleep around dawn.\n\n\"The door chime wakened me. It was a messenger with a note from\nPorter--Mr. Hays. A newspaper friend of his in Cairo had been\nchecking and discovered that my father had been dead six months.\nThe circumstances of his death were curious and Mr. Hays suggested\ncontacting the Cairo police as soon as the flight was over.\n\n\"This news was a terrible blow, but the moment I read it, I was free of\nSimon Kane. I went to the phone and asked the operator for the police.\nWhile I was waiting for the connection, there was a slight sound behind\nme. I turned and Simon was crossing the room. He was in his dressing\ngown. He must have come in while I was dozing. I ran for the door, but\nhe caught me and pushed me into a chair.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"When he had hung up the phone, he read Mr. Hays' note without saying a\nword. His face was terrible and I knew I was in danger. Then I saw that\nthe typed copy of the fourteenth tablet was gone.\n\n\"'You read it--the last tablet,' I said. 'And you know you've done all\nthis evil for nothing. The flight can't take place. If you--if you stop\nme from telling the police, Porter will tell them. He knows everything.'\n\n\"He took my wrist and dragged me to the studio and forced me into the\ncloset and locked the door. I could hear him crumpling and burning\npapers for a long time.\n\n\"At last he came close to the door and said, 'There, my dear! Try to\nprove that the tablets ever existed!'\n\n\"When he was gone, I screamed and pounded on the door until I was\nexhausted. A frightful thing was going to happen and there was nothing\nI could do to stop it.\n\n\"Only once--only one time since this all began have I opposed my\nhusband successfully. And it had no effect on the outcome. When I typed\nup the text of the last tablet, I made a carbon copy and put it in my\nhandbag. I have it here. I believe it will be evidence enough to prove\nthat Simon Kane is a murderer.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNalja Kane reached in her flat beaded bag and found a folded sheet,\nwhich she handed to Donner. He smoothed it on his knees with hands that\ntrembled a little.\n\n\"May he read it aloud, Mrs. Kane?\" asked Caples.\n\n\"Certainly, if he wishes. But the first part is technical data on a\nflight by an inventor named Axtel. The two last paragraphs contain the\nevidence I am offering you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDonner nodded and ran his finger down the sheet. He read:\n\n\"'The foregoing record is accurate and we acknowledge Axtel's\nsuperlative contribution to science. But we must admit that his\ngreatest contribution is in the proving of an axiom: Where ultimate\nforce is involved, it is better to know _none_ of the laws than to know\n_most_ of them.\n\n\"'On the fourth day, the aircraft returned from far space to the point\nof its departure. It was in excellent condition--but empty. Nothing\nremained of Axtel but merely his clothing and his ring.'\"\n\nNalja Kane covered her face with both hands and sobbed noiselessly.\n\nThe four men all gazed at the paper as it rustled in Donner's quivering\nhand.\n\nPresently the buzzer ripped the silence like the tearing of a shroud.\n\nAfter the second sharp buzz, G. W. Caples tripped the switch and\ncroaked, \"Yes?\"\n\nThe girl's voice, bright and businesslike, answered, \"There's a\nlong-distance call from Utah for Mr. Donner. It's a Mr. Ruhl. He says\nit's urgent.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Point of Departure, by Vaughan Shelton\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK POINT OF DEPARTURE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 50945.txt or 50945.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/0/9/4/50945/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\nwww.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
