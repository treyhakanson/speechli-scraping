BEAM PIPER and JOHN J. McGUIRE\n\n     +Many men have dreamed of world peace, but none have been able to\n     achieve it. If one man did have that power, could mankind afford to\n     pay the price?+\n\n\nAt the crest of the ridge, Benson stopped for an instant, glancing first\nat his wrist-watch and then back over his shoulder. It was 0539; the\nbarrage was due in eleven minutes, at the spot where he was now\nstanding. Behind, on the long northeast slope, he could see the columns\nof black oil smoke rising from what had been the Pan-Soviet advance\nsupply dump. There was a great deal of firing going on, back there; he\nwondered if the Commies had managed to corner a few of his men, after\nthe patrol had accomplished its mission and scattered, or if a couple of\nCommunist units were shooting each other up in mutual mistaken identity.\nThe result would be about the same in either case--reserve units would\nbe disorganized, and some men would have been pulled back from the front\nline. His dozen-odd UN regulars and Turkish partisans had done their\nbest to simulate a paratroop attack in force. At least, his job was\ndone; now to execute that classic infantry maneuver described as, \"Let's\nget the hell outa here.\" This was his last patrol before rotation home.\nHe didn't want anything unfortunate to happen.\n\nThere was a little ravine to the left; the stream which had cut it in\nthe steep southern slope of the ridge would be dry at this time of year,\nand he could make better time, and find protection in it from any chance\nshots when the interdictory barrage started. He hurried toward it and\nfollowed it down to the valley that would lead toward the front--the\nthinly-held section of the Communist lines, and the UN lines beyond,\nwhere fresh troops were waiting to jump from their holes and begin the\nattack.\n\nThere was something wrong about this ravine, though. At first, it was\nonly a vague presentiment, growing stronger as he followed the dry gully\ndown to the valley below. Something he had smelled, or heard, or seen,\nwithout conscious recognition. Then, in the dry sand where the ravine\ndebouched into the valley, he saw faint tank-tracks--only one pair.\nThere was something wrong about the vines that mantled one side of the\nravine, too....\n\nAn instant later, he was diving to the right, breaking his fall with the\nbutt of his auto-carbine, rolling rapidly toward the cover of a rock,\nand as he did so, the thinking part of his mind recognized what was\nwrong. The tank-tracks had ended against the vine-grown side of the\nravine, what he had smelled had been lubricating oil and petrol, and the\nleaves on some of the vines hung upside down.\n\nAlmost at once, from behind the vines, a tank's machine guns snarled at\nhim, clipping the place where he had been standing, then shifting to\nrage against the sheltering rock. With a sudden motor-roar, the muzzle\nof a long tank-gun pushed out through the vines, and then the low body\nof a tank with a red star on the turret came rumbling out of the\ncamouflaged bay. The machine guns kept him pinned behind the rock; the\ntank swerved ever so slightly so that its wide left tread was aimed\ndirectly at him, then picked up speed. Aren't even going to waste a\nshell on me, he thought.\n\nFutilely, he let go a clip from his carbine, trying to hit one of the\nvision-slits; then rolled to one side, dropped out the clip, slapped in\nanother. There was a shimmering blue mist around him. If he only hadn't\nused his last grenade, back there at the supply-dump....\n\nThe strange blue mist became a flickering radiance that ran through\nall the colors of the spectrum and became an utter, impenetrable\nblackness....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere were voices in the blackness, and a softness under him, but under\nhis back, when he had been lying on his stomach, as though he were now\non a comfortable bed. They got me alive, he thought; now comes the\nbrainwashing!\n\nHe cracked one eye open imperceptibly. Lights, white and glaring, from a\nceiling far above; walls as white as the lights. Without moving his\nhead, he opened both eyes and shifted them from right to left. Vaguely,\nhe could see people and, behind them, machines so simply designed that\ntheir functions were unguessable. He sat up and looked around groggily.\nThe people, their costumes--definitely not Pan-Soviet uniforms--and the\nroom and its machines, told him nothing. The hardness under his right\nhip was a welcome surprise; they hadn't taken his pistol from him!\nFeigning even more puzzlement and weakness, he clutched his knees with\nhis elbows and leaned his head forward on them, trying to collect his\nthoughts.\n\n\"We shall have to give up, Gregory,\" a voice trembled with\ndisappointment.\n\n\"Why, Anthony?\" The new voice was deeper, more aggressive.\n\n\"Look. Another typical reaction; retreat to the foetus.\"\n\nFootsteps approached. Another voice, discouragement heavily weighting\neach syllable: \"You're right. He's like all the others. We'll have to\nsend him back.\"\n\n\"And look for no more?\" The voice he recognized as Anthony faltered\nbetween question and statement.\n\nA babel of voices, in dispute; then, clearly, the voice Benson had come\nto label as Gregory, cut in:\n\n\"I will never give up!\"\n\nHe raised his head; there was something in the timbre of that voice\nreminding him of his own feelings in the dark days when the UN had\neverywhere been reeling back under the Pan-Soviet hammer-blows.\n\n\"Anthony!\" Gregory's voice again; Benson saw the speaker; short, stocky,\ngray-haired, stubborn lines about the mouth. The face of a man chasing\nan illusive but not uncapturable dream.\n\n\"That means nothing.\" A tall thin man, too lean for the tunic-like\ngarment he wore, was shaking his head.\n\nDeliberately, trying to remember his college courses in psychology, he\nforced himself to accept, and to assess, what he saw as reality. He was\non a small table, like an operating table; the whole place looked like a\nmedical lab or a clinic. He was still in uniform; his boots had soiled\nthe white sheets with the dust of Armenia. He had all his equipment,\nincluding his pistol and combat-knife; his carbine was gone, however. He\ncould feel the weight of his helmet on his head. The room still rocked\nand swayed a little, but the faces of the people were coming into focus.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe counted them, saying each number to himself: one, two, three, four,\nfive men; one woman. He swung his feet over the edge of the table, being\ncareful that it would be between him and the others when he rose, and\nbegan inching his right hand toward his right hip, using his left hand,\non his brow, to misdirect attention.\n\n\"I would classify his actions as arising from conscious effort at\ncortico-thalamic integration,\" the woman said, like an archaeologist who\nhas just found a K-ration tin at the bottom of a neolithic\nkitchen-midden. She had the peculiarly young-old look of the spinster\nteachers with whom Benson had worked before going to the war.\n\n\"I want to believe it, but I'm afraid to,\" another man for whom Benson\nhad no name-association said. He was portly, gray-haired,\narrogant-faced; he wore a short black jacket with a jewelled\nzipper-pull, and striped trousers.\n\nBenson cleared his throat. \"Just who are you people?\" he inquired. \"And\njust where am I?\"\n\nAnthony grabbed Gregory's hand and pumped it frantically.\n\n\"I've dreamed of the day when I could say this!\" he cried.\n\"Congratulations, Gregory!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat touched off another bedlam, of joy, this time, instead of despair.\nBenson hid his amusement at the facility with which all of them were\ndiscovering in one another the courage, vision and stamina of true\npatriots and pioneers. He let it go on for a few moments, hoping to\nglean some clue. Finally, he interrupted.\n\n\"I believe I asked a couple of questions,\" he said, using the voice he\nreserved for sergeants and second lieutenants. \"I hate to break up this\nmutual admiration session, but I would appreciate some answers. This\nisn't anything like the situation I last remember....\"\n\n\"He remembers!\" Gregory exclaimed. \"That confirms your first derivation\nby symbolic logic, and it strengthens the validity of the second....\"\n\nThe schoolteacherish woman began jabbering excitedly; she ran through\nabout a paragraph of what was pure gobbledegook to Benson, before the\nman with the arrogant face and the jewelled zipper-pull broke in on her.\n\n\"Save that for later, Paula,\" he barked. \"I'd be very much interested in\nyour theories about why memories are unimpaired when you time-jump\nforward and lost when you reverse the process, but let's stick to\nbusiness. We have what we wanted; now let's use what we have.\"\n\n\"I never liked the way you made your money,\" a dark-faced, cadaverous\nman said, \"but when you talk, it makes sense. Let's get on with it.\"\n\nBenson used the brief silence which followed to study the six. With the\nexception of the two who had just spoken, there was the indefinable mark\nof the fanatic upon all of them--people fanatical about different\nthings, united for different reasons in a single purpose. It reminded\nhim sharply of some teachers' committee about to beard a school-board\nwith an unpopular and expensive recommendation.\n\nAnthony--the oldest of the lot, in a knee-length tunic--turned to\nGregory.\n\n\"I believe you had better....\" he began.\n\n\"As to who we are, we'll explain that, partially, later. As for your\nquestion, 'Where am I?' that will have to be rephrased. If you ask,\n'When and where am I?' I can furnish a rational answer. In the temporal\ndimension, you are fifty years futureward of the day of your death;\nspatially, you are about eight thousand miles from the place of your\ndeath, in what is now the World Capitol, St. Louis.\"\n\nNothing in the answer made sense but the name of the city. Benson\nchuckled.\n\n\"What happened; the Cardinals conquer the world? I knew they had a good\nteam, but I didn't think it was that good.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" Gregory told him earnestly. \"The government isn't a theocracy.\nAt least not yet. But if The Guide keeps on insisting that only\nbeautiful things are good and that he is uniquely qualified to define\nbeauty, watch his rule change into just that.\"\n\n\"I've been detecting symptoms of religious paranoia, messianic\ndelusions, about his public statements....\" the woman began.\n\n\"Idolatry!\" another member of the group, who wore a black coat fastened\nto the neck, and white neck-bands, rasped. \"Idolatry in deed, as well as\nin spirit!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe sense of unreality, partially dispelled, began to return. Benson\ndropped to the floor and stood beside the table, getting a cigarette out\nof his pocket and lighting it.\n\n\"I made a joke,\" he said, putting his lighter away. \"The fact that none\nof you got it has done more to prove that I am fifty years in the future\nthan anything any of you could say.\" He went on to explain who the St.\nLouis Cardinals were.\n\n\"Yes; I remember! Baseball!\" Anthony exclaimed. \"There is no baseball,\nnow. The Guide will not allow competitive sports; he says that they\nfoster the spirit of violence....\"\n\nThe cadaverous man in the blue jacket turned to the man in the black\ngarment of similar cut.\n\n\"You probably know more history than any of us,\" he said, getting a\ncigar out of his pocket and lighting it. He lighted it by rubbing the\nend on the sole of his shoe. \"Suppose you tell him what the score is.\"\nHe turned to Benson. \"You can rely on his dates and happenings; his\ninterpretation's strictly capitalist, of course,\" he said.\n\nBlack-jacket shook his head. \"You first, Gregory,\" he said. \"Tell him\nhow he got here, and then I'll tell him why.\"\n\n\"I believe,\" Gregory began, \"that in your period, fiction writers made\nsome use of the subject of time-travel. It was not, however, given\nserious consideration, largely because of certain alleged paradoxes\ninvolved, and because of an elementalistic and objectifying attitude\ntoward the whole subject of time. I won't go into the mathematics and\nsymbolic logic involved, but we have disposed of the objections; more,\nwe have succeeded in constructing a time-machine, if you want to call it\nthat. We prefer to call it a temporal-spatial displacement field\ngenerator.\"\n\n\"It's really very simple,\" the woman called Paula interrupted. \"If the\nuniverse is expanding, time is a widening spiral; if contracting, a\ndiminishing spiral; if static, a uniform spiral. The possibility of\npulsation was our only worry....\"\n\n\"That's no worry,\" Gregory reproved her. \"I showed you that the rate was\ntoo slow to have an effect on....\"\n\n\"Oh, nonsense; you can measure something which exists within a\nmicrosecond, but where is the instrument to measure a temporal pulsation\nthat may require years...? You haven't come to that yet.\"\n\n\"Be quiet, both of you!\" the man with the black coat and the white bands\ncommanded. \"While you argue about vanities, thousands are being\nconverted to the godlessness of The Guide, and other thousands of his\ndupes are dying, unprepared to face their Maker!\"\n\n\"All right, you invented a time-machine,\" Benson said. \"In civvies, I\nwas only a high school chemistry teacher. I can tell a class of juniors\nthe difference between H_{2}O and H_{2}SO_{4}, but the theory of\ntime-travel is wasted on me.... Suppose you just let me ask the\nquestions; then I'll be sure of finding out what I don't know. For\ninstance, who won the war I was fighting in, before you grabbed me and\nbrought me here? The Commies?\"\n\n\"No, the United Nations,\" Anthony told him. \"At least, they were the\nleast exhausted when both sides decided to quit.\"\n\n\"Then what's this dictatorship.... The Guide? Extreme Rightist?\"\n\n\"Walter, you'd better tell him,\" Gregory said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"We damn near lost the war,\" the man in the black jacket and striped\ntrousers said, \"but for once, we won the peace. The Soviet Bloc was\nbroken up--India, China, Indonesia, Mongolia, Russia, the Ukraine, all\nthe Satellite States. Most of them turned into little dictatorships,\nlike the Latin American countries after the liberation from Spain, but\nthey were personal, non-ideological, generally benevolent,\ndictatorships, the kind that can grow into democracies, if they're given\ntime.\"\n\n\"Capitalistic dictatorships, he means,\" the cadaverous man in the blue\njacket explained.\n\n\"Be quiet, Carl,\" Anthony told him. \"Let's not confuse this with any\nclass-struggle stuff.\"\n\n\"Actually, the United Nations rules the world,\" Walter continued. \"What\ngoes on in the Ukraine or Latvia or Manchuria is about analogous to what\nwent on under the old United States government in, let's say,\nTammany-ruled New York. But here's the catch. The UN is ruled absolutely\nby one man.\"\n\n\"How could that happen? In my time, the UN had its functions so\nsubdivided and compartmented that it couldn't even run a war properly.\nOur army commanders were making war by systematic disobedience.\"\n\n\"The charter was changed shortly after ... er, that is, after....\"\nWalter was fumbling for words.\n\n\"After my death.\" Benson finished politely. \"Go on. Even with a changed\ncharter, how did one man get all the powers into his hands?\"\n\n\"By sorcery!\" black-coat-and-white-bands fairly shouted. \"By the help of\nhis master, Satan!\"\n\n\"You know, there are times when some such theory tempts me,\" Paula said.\n\n\"He was a big moneybags,\" Carl said. \"He bribed his way in. See, New\nYork was bombed flat. Where the old UN buildings were, it's still hot.\nSo The Guide donated a big tract of land outside St. Louis, built these\nbuildings--we're in the basement of one of them, right now, if you want\na good laugh--and before long, he had the whole organization eating out\nof his hand. They just voted him into power, and the world into\nslavery.\"\n\nBenson looked around at the others, who were nodding in varying degrees\nof agreement.\n\n\"Substantially, that's it. He managed to convince everybody of his\naltruism, integrity and wisdom,\" Walter said. \"It was almost\nblasphemous to say anything against him. I really don't understand how\nit happened....\"\n\n\"Well, what's he been doing with his power?\" Benson asked. \"Wise things,\nor stupid ones?\"\n\n\"I could be general, and say that he has deprived all of us of our\npolitical and other liberties. It is best to be specific,\" Anthony said.\n\"Gregory?\"\n\n\"My own field--dimensional physics--hasn't been interfered with much,\nyet. It's different in other fields. For instance, all research in\nsonics has been arbitrarily stopped. So has a great deal of work in\norganic and synthetic chemistry. Psychology is a madhouse of ... what\nwas the old word, licentiousness? No, lysenkoism. Medicine and\nsurgery--well, there's a huge program of compulsory sterilization, and\nanother one of eugenic marriage-control. And infants who don't conform\nto certain physical standards don't survive. Neither do people who have\ndisfiguring accidents beyond the power of plastic surgery.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPaula spoke next. \"My field is child welfare. Well, I'm going to show\nyou an audio-visual of an interesting ceremony in a Hindu village,\nderived from the ancient custom of the suttee. It is the Hindu method of\nconforming to The Guide's demand that only beautiful children be allowed\nto grow to maturity.\"\n\nThe film was mercifully brief. Even in spite of the drums and gongs, and\nthe chanting of the crowd, Benson found out how loudly a newborn infant\ncan scream in a fire. The others looked as though they were going to be\nsick; he doubted if he looked much better.\n\n\"Of course, we are a more practical and mechanical-minded people, here\nand in Europe,\" Paula added, holding down her gorge by main strength.\n\"We have lethal-gas chambers that even Hitler would have envied.\"\n\n\"I am a musician,\" Anthony said. \"A composer. If Gregory thinks that the\nsciences are controlled, he should try to write even the simplest piece\nof music. The extent of censorship and control over all the arts, and\nespecially music, is incredible.\" He coughed slightly. \"And I have\nanother motive, a more selfish one. I am approaching the compulsory\nretirement age; I will soon be invited to go to one of the Havens. Even\nthough these Havens are located in the most barren places, they are\nbeauty-spots, verdant beyond belief. It is of only passing interest\nthat, while large numbers of the aged go there yearly, their populations\nremain constant, and, to judge from the quantities of supplies shipped\nto them, extremely small.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"They call me Samuel, in this organization,\" the man in the long black\ncoat said. \"Whoever gave me that alias must have chosen it because I am\nhere in an effort to live up to it. Although I am ordained by no church,\nI fight for all of them. The plain fact is that this man we call The\nGuide is really the Antichrist!\"\n\n\"Well, I haven't quite so lofty a motive, but it's good enough to make\nme willing to finance this project,\" Walter said. \"It's very simple. The\nGuide won't let people make money, and if they do, he taxes it away from\nthem. And he has laws to prohibit inheritance; what little you can\naccumulate, you can't pass on to your children.\"\n\n\"I put up a lot of the money, too, don't forget,\" Carl told him. \"Or the\nUnion did; I'm a poor man, myself.\" He was smoking an excellent cigar,\nfor a poor man, and his clothes could have come from the same tailor as\nWalter's. \"Look, we got a real Union--the Union of all unions. Every\nworking man in North America, Europe, Australia and South Africa belongs\nto it. And The Guide has us all hog-tied.\"\n\n\"He won't let you strike,\" Benson chuckled.\n\n\"That's right. And what can we do? Why, we can't even make our\nclosed-shop contracts stick. And as far as getting anything like a\npay-raise....\"\n\n\"Good thing. Another pay-raise in some of my companies would bankrupt\nthem, the way The Guide has us under his thumb....\" Walter began, but he\nwas cut off.\n\n\"Well! It seems as though this Guide has done some good, if he's made\nyou two realize that you're both on the same side, and that what hurts\none hurts both,\" Benson said. \"When I shipped out for Turkey in '77,\nneither Labor nor Management had learned that.\" He looked from one to\nanother of them. \"The Guide must have a really good bodyguard, with all\nthe enemies he's made.\"\n\nGregory shook his head. \"He lives virtually alone, in a very small house\non the UN Capitol grounds. In fact, except for a small police-force,\narmed only with non-lethal stun-guns, your profession of arms is\nnon-existent.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I've been guessing what you want me to do,\" Benson said. \"You want this\nGuide bumped off. But why can't any of you do it? Or, if it's too risky,\nat least somebody from your own time? Why me?\"\n\n\"We can't. Everybody in the world today is conditioned against violence,\nespecially the taking of human life,\" Anthony told him.\n\n\"Now, wait a moment!\" This time, he was using the voice he would have\nemployed in chiding a couple of Anatolian peasant partisans who were\nfield-stripping a machine gun the wrong way. \"Those babies in that film\nyou showed me weren't dying of old age....\"\n\n\"That is not violence,\" Paula said bitterly. \"That is humane\nbeneficence. Ugly people would be unhappy, and would make others\nunhappy, in a world where everybody else is beautiful.\"\n\n\"And all these oppressive and tyrannical laws,\" Benson continued. \"How\ndoes he enforce them, without violence, actual or threatened?\"\n\nSamuel started to say something about the Power of the Evil One; Paula,\nignoring him, said:\n\n\"I really don't know; he just does it. Mass hypnotism of some sort. I\nknow music has something to do with it, because there is always music,\neverywhere. This laboratory, for instance, was secretly soundproofed; we\ncouldn't have worked here, otherwise.\"\n\n\"All right. I can see that you'd need somebody from the past, preferably\na soldier, whose conditioning has been in favor rather than against\nviolence. I'm not the only one you snatched, I take it?\"\n\n\"No. We've been using that machine to pick up men from battlefields all\nover the world and all over history,\" Gregory said. \"Until now, none of\nthem could adjust.... Uggh!\" He shuddered, looking even sicker than when\nthe film was being shown.\n\n\"He's thinking,\" Walter said, \"about a French officer from Waterloo who\nblew out his brains with a pocket-pistol on that table, and an English\narcher from Agincourt who ran amok with a dagger in here, and a trooper\nof the Seventh Cavalry from the Custer Massacre.\"\n\nGregory managed to overcome his revulsion. \"You see, we were forced to\ntake our subjects largely at random with regard to individual\ncharacteristics, mental attitudes, adaptability, et cetera.\" As long as\nhe stuck to high order abstractions, he could control himself. \"Aside\nfrom their professional lack of repugnance for violence, we took\nsoldiers from battlefields because we could select men facing immediate\ndeath, whose removal from the past would not have any effect upon the\ncasual chain of events affecting the present.\"\n\nA warning buzzer rasped in Benson's brain. He nodded, poker-faced.\n\n\"I can see that,\" he agreed. \"You wouldn't dare do anything to change\nthe past. That was always one of the favorite paradoxes in time-travel\nfiction.... Well, I think I have the general picture. You have a\ndictator who is tyrannizing you; you want to get rid of him; you can't\nkill him yourselves. I'm opposed to dictators, myself; that--and the\nSelective Service law, of course--was why I was a soldier. I have no\nmoral or psychological taboos against killing dictators, or anybody\nelse. Suppose I cooperate with you; what's in it for me?\"\n\nThere was a long silence. Walter and Carl looked at one another\ninquiringly; the others dithered helplessly. It was Carl who answered.\n\n\"Your return to your own time and place.\"\n\n\"And if I don't cooperate with you?\"\n\n\"Guess when and where else we could send you,\" Walter said.\n\nBenson dropped his cigarette and tramped it.\n\n\"Exactly the same time and place?\" he asked.\n\n\"Well, the structure of space-time demands....\" Paula began.\n\n\"The spatio-temporal displacement field is capable of identifying that\nspot--\" Gregory pointed to a ten-foot circle in front of a bank of\nsleek-cabineted, dial-studded machines \"--with any set of space-time\ncoordinates in the universe. However, to avoid disruption of the\nstructure of space-time, we must return you to approximately the same\npoint in space-time.\"\n\nBenson nodded again, this time at the confirmation of his earlier\nsuspicion. Well, while he was alive, he still had a chance.\n\n\"All right; tell me exactly what you want me to do.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA third outbreak of bedlam, this time of relief and frantic explanation.\n\n\"Shut up, all of you!\" For so thin a man, Carl had an astonishing voice.\n\"I worked this out, so let me tell it.\" He turned to Benson. \"Maybe I'm\ntougher than the rest of them, or maybe I'm not as deeply conditioned.\nFor one thing, I'm tone-deaf. Well, here's the way it is. Gregory can\nset the machine to function automatically. You stand where he shows you,\npress the button he shows you, and fifteen seconds later it'll take you\nforward in time five seconds and about a kilometer in space, to The\nGuide's office. He'll be at his desk now. You'll have forty-five seconds\nto do the job, from the time the field collapses around you till it\nrebuilds. Then you'll be taken back to your own time again. The whole\nthing's automatic.\"\n\n\"Can do,\" Benson agreed. \"How do I kill him?\"\n\n\"I'm getting sick!\" Paula murmured weakly. Her face was whiter than her\ngown.\n\n\"Take care of her, Samuel. Both of you'd better get out of here,\"\nGregory said.\n\n\"The Lord of Hosts is my strength, He will.... Uggggh!\" Samuel gasped.\n\n\"Conditioning's getting him, too; we gotta be quick,\" Carl said. \"Here.\nThis is what you'll use.\" He handed Benson a two-inch globe of black\nplastic. \"Take the damn thing, quick! Little button on the side; press\nit, and get it out of your hand fast....\" He retched. \"Limited-effect\nbomb; everything within two-meter circle burned to nothing; outside\nthat, great but not unendurable heat. Shut your eyes when you throw it.\nFlash almost blinding.\" He dropped his cigar and turned almost green in\nthe face. Walter had a drink poured and handed it to him. \"Uggh! Thanks,\nWalter.\" He downed it.\n\n\"Peculiar sort of thing for a non-violent people to manufacture,\" Benson\nsaid, looking at the bomb and then putting it in his jacket pocket.\n\n\"It isn't a weapon. Industrial; we use it in mining. I used plenty of\nthem, in Walter's iron mines.\"\n\nHe nodded again. \"Where do I stand, now?\" he asked.\n\n\"Right over here.\" Gregory placed him in front of a small panel with\nthree buttons. \"Press the middle one, and step back into the small red\ncircle and stand perfectly still while the field builds up and\ncollapses. Face that way.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBenson drew his pistol and checked it; magazine full, a round in the\nchamber, safety on.\n\n\"Put that horrid thing out of sight!\" Anthony gasped. \"The ... the other\nthing ... is what you want to use.\"\n\n\"The bomb won't be any good if some of his guards come in before the\nfield re-builds,\" Benson said.\n\n\"He has no guards. He lives absolutely alone. We told you....\"\n\n\"I know you did. You probably believed it, too. I don't. And by the way,\nyou're sending me forward. What do you do about the fact that a\ntime-jump seems to make me pass out?\"\n\n\"Here. Before you press the button, swallow it.\" Gregory gave him a\nsmall blue pill.\n\n\"Well, I guess that's all there is,\" Gregory continued. \"I hope....\" His\nface twitched, and he dropped to the floor with a thud. Carl and Walter\ncame forward, dragged him away from the machine.\n\n\"Conditioning got him. Getting me, too,\" Walter said. \"Hurry up, man!\"\n\nBenson swallowed the pill, pressed the button and stepped back into the\nred circle, drawing his pistol and snapping off the safety. The blue\nmist closed in on him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis time, however, it did not thicken into blackness. It became\nluminous, brightening to a dazzle and dimming again to a colored mist,\nand then it cleared, while Benson stood at raise pistol, as though on a\ntarget range. He was facing a big desk at twenty feet, across a\nthick-piled blue rug. There was a man seated at the desk, a white-haired\nman with a mustache and a small beard, who wore a loose coat of some\nglossy plum-brown fabric, and a vividly blue neck-scarf.\n\nThe pistol centered on the v-shaped blue under his chin. Deliberately,\nBenson squeezed, recovered from the recoil, aimed, fired, recovered,\naimed, fired. Five seconds gone. The old man slumped across the desk,\nhis arms extended. Better make a good job of it, six, seven, eight\nseconds; he stepped forward to the edge of the desk, call that fifteen\nseconds, and put the muzzle to the top of the man's head, firing again\nand snapping on the safety. There had been something familiar about The\nGuide's face, but it was too late to check on that, now. There wasn't\nany face left; not even much head.\n\nA box, on the desk, caught Benson's eye, a cardboard box with an\nenvelope, stamped _Top Secret! For the Guide Only!_ taped to it. He\nholstered his pistol and caught that up, stuffing it into his pocket, in\nobedience to an instinct to grab anything that looked like intelligence\nmatter while in the enemy's country. Then he stepped back to the spot\nwhere the field had deposited him. He had ten seconds to spare; somebody\nwas banging on a door when the blue mist began to gather around him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was crouching, the spherical plastic object in his right hand, his\nthumb over the button, when the field collapsed. Sure enough, right in\nfront of him, so close that he could smell the very heat of it, was the\nbig tank with the red star on its turret. He cursed the sextet of\nsanctimonious double-crossers eight thousand miles and fifty years away\nin space-time. The machine guns had stopped--probably because they\ncouldn't be depressed far enough to aim at him, now; that was a\nnotorious fault of some of the newer Pan-Soviet tanks--and he rocked\nback on his heels, pressed the button, and heaved, closing his eyes. As\nthe thing left his fingers, he knew that he had thrown too hard. His\nmuscles, accustomed to the heavier cast-iron grenades of his experience,\nhad betrayed him. For a moment, he was closer to despair than at any\nother time in the whole phantasmagoric adventure. Then he was hit, with\nphysical violence, by a wave of almost solid heat. It didn't smell like\nthe heat of the tank's engines; it smelled like molten metal, with\nundertones of burned flesh. Immediately, there was a multiple explosion\nthat threw him flat, as the tank's ammunition went up. There were no\nscreams. It was too fast for that. He opened his eyes.\n\nThe turret and top armor of the tank had vanished. The two massive\ntreads had been toppled over, one to either side. The body had collapsed\nbetween them, and it was running sticky trickles of molten metal. He\nblinked, rubbed his eyes on the back of his hand, and looked again. Of\nall the many blasted and burned-out tanks, Soviet and UN, that he had\nseen, this was the most completely wrecked thing in his experience. And\nhe'd done that with one grenade....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt that moment, there was a sudden rushing overhead, and an instant\nlater the barrage began falling beyond the crest of the ridge. He looked\nat his watch, blinked, and looked again. That barrage was due at 0550;\naccording to the watch, it was 0726. He was sure that, ten minutes ago,\nwhen he had looked at it, up there at the head of the ravine, it had\nbeen twenty minutes to six. He puzzled about that for a moment, and\ndecided that he must have caught the stem on something and pulled it\nout, and then twisted it a little, setting the watch ahead. Then,\nsomehow, the stem had gotten pushed back in, starting it at the new\nsetting. That was a pretty far-fetched explanation, but it was the only\none he could think of.\n\nBut about this tank, now. He was positive that he could remember\nthrowing a grenade.... Yet he'd used his last grenade back there at the\nsupply dump. He saw his carbine, and picked it up. That silly blackout\nhe'd had, for a second, there; he must have dropped it. Action was open,\nempty magazine on the ground where he'd dropped it. He wondered,\nstupidly, if one of his bullets couldn't have gone down the muzzle of\nthe tank's gun and exploded the shell in the chamber.... Oh, the hell\nwith it! The tank might have been hit by a premature shot from the\nbarrage which was raging against the far slope of the ridge. He reset\nhis watch by guess and looked down the valley. The big attack would be\nstarting any minute, now, and there would be fleeing Commies coming up\nthe valley ahead of the UN advance. He'd better get himself placed\nbefore they started coming in on him.\n\nHe stopped thinking about the mystery of the blown-up tank, a solution\nto which seemed to dance maddeningly just out of his mental reach, and\nfound himself a place among the rocks to wait. Down the valley he could\nhear everything from pistols to mortars going off, and shouting in three\nor four racial intonations. After a while, fugitive Communists began\ncoming, many of them without their equipment, stumbling in their haste\nand looking back over their shoulders. Most of them avoided the mouth\nof the ravine and hurried by to the left or right, but one little clump,\neight or ten, came up the dry stream-bed, and stopped a hundred and\nfifty yards from his hiding-place to make a stand. They were Hindus,\nwith outsize helmets over their turbans. Two of them came ahead,\ncarrying a machine gun, followed by a third with a flame-thrower; the\nothers retreated more slowly, firing their rifles to delay pursuit.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCuddling the stock of his carbine to his cheek, he divided a ten-shot\nburst between the two machine-gunners, then, as a matter of principle,\nhe shot the man with the flame-thrower. He had a dislike for\nflame-throwers; he killed every enemy he found with one. The others\ndropped their rifles and raised their hands, screaming: \"Hey, Joe! Hey,\nJoe! You no shoot, me no shoot!\"\n\nA dozen men in UN battledress came up and took them prisoner. Benson\nshouted to them, and then rose and came down to join them. They were\nBritish--Argyle and Sutherland Highlanders, advertising the fact by\ninconspicuous bits of tartan on their uniforms. The subaltern in command\nlooked at him and nodded.\n\n\"Captain Benson? We were warned to be on watch for your patrol,\" he\nsaid. \"Any of the rest of you lads get out?\"\n\nBenson shrugged. \"We split up after the attack. You may run into a\ncouple of them. Some are locals and don't speak very good English. I've\ngot to get back to Division, myself; what's the best way?\"\n\n\"Down that way. You'll overtake a couple of our walking wounded. If you\ndon't mind going slowly, they'll show you the way to advance dressing\nstation, and you can hitch a ride on an ambulance from there.\"\n\nBenson nodded. Off on the left, there was a flurry of small-arms fire,\nending in yells of \"Hey, Joe! Hey, Joe!\"--the World War IV version of\n\"Kamarad\"!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis company was a non-T/O outfit; he came directly under Division\ncommand and didn't have to bother reporting to any regimental or brigade\ncommanders. He walked for an hour with half a dozen lightly wounded\nScots, rode for another hour on a big cat-truck loaded with casualties\nof six regiments and four races, and finally reached Division Rear,\nwhere both the Division and Corps commanders took time to compliment him\non the part his last hunter patrol had played in the now complete\nbreakthrough. His replacement, an equine-faced Spaniard with an imposing\ndisplay of fruit-salad, was there, too; he solemnly took off the\nbracelet a refugee Caucasian goldsmith had made for his predecessor's\npredecessor and gave it to the new commander of what had formerly been\nBenson's Butchers. As he had expected, there was also another medal\nwaiting for him.\n\nA medical check at Task Force Center got him a warning; his last patrol\nhad brought him dangerously close to the edge of combat fatigue.\nRemembering the incidents of the tank and the unaccountably fast watch,\nand the mysterious box and envelope which he had found in his coat\npocket, he agreed, saying nothing about the questions that were puzzling\nhim. The Psychological Department was never too busy to refuse another\ncase; they hunted patients gleefully, each psych-shark seeking in every\none proof of his own particular theories. It was with relief that he\nwatched them fill out the red tag which gave him a priority on jet\ntransports for home.\n\nAnkara to Alexandria, Alexandria to Dakar, Dakar to Bel\u00e9m, Bel\u00e9m to the\nshattered skyline of New York, the \"hurry-and-wait\" procedures at Fort\nCarlisle, and, after the usual separation promotion, Major Fred Benson,\nlate of Benson's Butchers, was back at teaching high school juniors the\ndifference between H_{2}O and H_{2}SO_{4}.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere were two high schools in the city: McKinley High, on the east\nside, and Dwight Eisenhower High, on the west. A few blocks from\nMcKinley was the Tulip Tavern, where the Eisenhower teachers came in the\nlate afternoons; the McKinley faculty crossed town to do their\nafter-school drinking on the west side. When Benson entered the Tulip\nTavern, on a warm September afternoon, he found Bill Myers, the school\npsychologist, at one of the tables, smoking his pipe, checking over a\nstack of aptitude test forms, and drinking beer. He got a highball at\nthe bar and carried it over to Bill's table.\n\n\"Oh, hi, Fred.\" The psychologist separated the finished from the\nunfinished work with a sheet of yellow paper and crammed the whole\nbusiness into his brief case. \"I was hoping somebody'd show up....\"\n\nBenson lit a cigarette, sipped his highball. They talked at\nrandom--school-talk; the progress of the war, now in its twelfth year;\npersonal reminiscences, of the Turkish Theater where Benson had served,\nand the Madras Beachhead, where Myers had been.\n\n\"Bring home any souvenirs?\" Myers asked.\n\n\"Not much. Couple of pistols, couple of knives, some pictures. I don't\nremember what all; haven't gotten around to unpacking them, yet.... I\nhave a sixth of rye and some beer, at my rooms. Let's go around and see\nwhat I did bring home.\"\n\nThey finished their drinks and went out.\n\n\"What the devil's that?\" Myers said, pointing to the cardboard box with\nthe envelope taped to it, when Benson lifted it out of the gray-green\nlocker.\n\n\"Bill, I don't know,\" Benson said. \"I found it in the pocket of my coat,\non my way back from my last hunter patrol.... I've never told anybody\nabout this, before.\"\n\n\"That's the damnedest story I've ever heard, and in my racket you hear\nsome honeys,\" Myers said, when he had finished. \"You couldn't have\npicked that thing up in some other way, deliberately forgotten the\ncircumstances, and fabricated this story about the tank and the grenade\nand the discrepancy in your watch subconsciously as an explanation?\"\n\n\"My subconscious is a better liar than that,\" Benson replied. \"It\nwould have cobbled up some kind of a story that would stand up. This\nbusiness....\"\n\n\"Top Secret! For the Guide Only!\" Myers frowned. \"That isn't one of our\nmarks, and if it were Soviet, it'd be tri-lingual, Russian, Hindi and\nChinese.\"\n\n\"Well, let's see what's in it. I want this thing cleared up. I've been\nhaving some of the nastiest dreams, lately....\"\n\n\"Well, be careful; it may be booby-trapped,\" Myers said urgently.\n\n\"Don't worry; I will.\"\n\nHe used a knife to slice the envelope open without untaping it from the\nbox, and exposed five sheets of typewritten onion-skin paper. There was\nno letterhead, no salutation or address-line. Just a mass of chemical\nformulae, and a concise report on tests. It seemed to be a report on an\nimproved syrup for a carbonated soft-drink. There were a few cryptic\ncautionary references to heightened physico-psychological effects.\n\nThe box was opened with the same caution, but it proved as innocent of\ndangers as the envelope. It contained only a half-liter bottle,\nwax-sealed, containing a dark reddish-brown syrup.\n\n\"There's a lot of this stuff I don't dig,\" Benson said, tapping the\nsheets of onion-skin. \"I don't even scratch the surface of this\nrigamarole about The Guide. I'm going to get to work on this sample in\nthe lab, at school, though. Maybe we have something, here.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt eight-thirty the next evening, after four and a half hours work, he\nstopped to check what he had found out.\n\nThe school's X-ray, an excellent one, had given him a complete picture\nof the molecular structure of the syrup. There were a couple of\nlong-chain molecules that he could only believe after two\nre-examinations and a careful check of the machine, but with the help of\nthe notes he could deduce how they had been put together. They would be\nthe Ingredient Alpha and Ingredient Beta referred to in the notes.\n\nThe components of the syrup were all simple and easily procurable with\nthese two exceptions, as were the basic components from which these were\nmade.\n\nThe mechanical guinea-pig demonstrated that the syrup contained nothing\nharmful to human tissue.\n\nOf course, there were the warnings about heightened psycho-physiological\neffects....\n\nHe stuck a poison-label on the bottle, locked it up, and went home. The\nnext day, he and Bill Myers got a bottle of carbonated water and mixed\nthemselves a couple of drinks of it. It was delicious--sweet, dry, tart,\nsour, all of these in alternating waves of pleasure.\n\n\"We do have something, Bill,\" he said. \"We have something that's going\nto give our income-tax experts headaches.\"\n\n\"You have,\" Myers corrected. \"Where do you start fitting me into it?\"\n\n\"We're a good team, Bill. I'm a chemist, but I don't know a thing about\npeople. You're a psychologist. A real one; not one of these night-school\nboys. A juvenile psychologist, too. And what age-group spends the most\nmoney in this country for soft-drinks?\"\n\nKnowing the names of the syrup's ingredients, and what their molecular\nstructure was like, was only the beginning. Gallon after gallon of the\nSchool Board's chemicals went down the laboratory sink; Fred Benson and\nBill Myers almost lived in the fourth floor lab. Once or twice there\nwere head-shaking warnings from the principal about the dangers of\nover-work. The watchmen, at all hours, would hear the occasional\ntwanging of Benson's guitar in the laboratory, and know that he had come\nto a dead end on something and was trying to think. Football season came\nand went; basketball season; the inevitable riot between McKinley and\nEisenhower rooters; the Spring concerts. The term-end exams were only a\nmonth away when Benson and Myers finally did it, and stood solemnly,\neach with a beaker in either hand and took alternate sips of the\noriginal and the drink mixed from the syrup they had made.\n\n\"Not a bit of difference, Fred,\" Myers said. \"We have it!\"\n\nBenson picked up the guitar and began plunking on it.\n\n\"Hey!\" Myers exclaimed. \"Have you been finding time to take lessons on\nthat thing? I never heard you play as well as that!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey decided to go into business in St. Louis. It was centrally located,\nand, being behind more concentric circles of radar and counter-rocket\ndefenses, it was in better shape than any other city in the country and\nmost likely to stay that way. Getting started wasn't hard; the first\nbanker who tasted the new drink-named Evri-Flave, at Myers'\nsuggestion--couldn't dig up the necessary money fast enough. Evri-Flave\nhit the market with a bang and became an instant success; soon the\nrainbow-tinted vending machines were everywhere, dispensing the\nslender, slightly flattened bottles and devouring quarters voraciously.\nIn spite of high taxes and the difficulties of doing business in a\nconsumers' economy upon which a war-time economy had been superimposed,\nboth Myers and Benson were rapidly becoming wealthy. The gregarious\nMyers installed himself in a luxurious apartment in the city; Benson\nbought a large tract of land down the river toward Carondelet and\nstarted building a home and landscaping the grounds.\n\nThe dreams began bothering him again, now that the urgency of getting\nEvri-Flave, Inc., started had eased. They were not dreams of the men he\nhad killed in battle, or, except for one about a huge, hot-smelling tank\nwith a red star on the turret, about the war. Generally, they were about\na strange, beautiful, office-room, in which a young man in uniform\nkilled an older man in a plum-brown coat and a vivid blue neck-scarf.\nSometimes Benson identified himself with the killer; sometimes with the\nold man who was killed.\n\nHe talked to Myers about these dreams, but beyond generalities about\ndelayed effects of combat fatigue and vague advice to relax, the\npsychologist, now head of Sales & Promotion of Evri-Flave, Inc., could\ngive him no help.\n\nThe war ended three years after the new company was launched. There was\na momentary faltering of the economy, and then the work of\nreconstruction was crying hungrily for all the labor and capital that\nhad been idled by the end of destruction, and more. There was a new\nflood-tide of prosperity, and Evri-Flave rode the crest. The estate at\nCarondelet was finished--a beautiful place, surrounded with gardens,\nfragrant with flowers, full of the songs of birds and soft music from\nconcealed record-players. It made him forget the ugliness of the war,\nand kept the dreams from returning so frequently. All the world ought to\nbe like that, he thought; beautiful and quiet and peaceful. People\nsurrounded with such beauty couldn't think about war.\n\nAll the world could be like that, if only....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe UN chose St. Louis for its new headquarters--many of its offices had\nbeen moved there after the second and most destructive bombing of New\nYork--and when the city by the Mississippi began growing into a real\nWorld Capital, the flow of money into it almost squared overnight.\nBenson began to take an active part in politics in the new World\nSovereignty party. He did not, however, allow his political activities\nto distract him from the work of expanding the company to which he owed\nhis wealth and position. There were always things to worry about.\n\n\"I don't know,\" Myers said to him, one evening, as they sat over a\nbottle of rye in the psychologist's apartment. \"I could make almost as\nmuch money practicing as a psychiatrist, these days. The whole world\nseems to be going pure, unadulterated nuts! That affair in Munich, for\ninstance.\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Benson grimaced as he thought of the affair in Munich--a\nWagnerian concert which had terminated in an insane orgy of mass\nsuicide. \"Just a week after we started our free-sample campaign in South\nGermany, too....\"\n\nHe stopped short, downing his drink and coughing over it.\n\n\"Bill! You remember those sheets of onion-skin in that envelope?\"\n\n\"The foundation of our fortunes; I wonder where you really did get\nthat.... Fred!\" His eyes widened in horror. \"That caution about\n'heightened psycho-physiological effects,' that we were never able\nto understand!\"\n\nBenson nodded grimly. \"And think of all the crazy cases of\nmass-hysteria--that baseball-game riot in Baltimore; the time everybody\nstarted tearing off each others' clothes in Milwaukee; the sex-orgy in\nNew Orleans. And the sharp uptrend in individual psycho-neurotic and\npsychotic behavior. All in connection with music, too, and all after\nEvri-Flave got on the market.\"\n\n\"We'll have to stop it; pull Evri-Flave off the market,\" Myers said. \"We\ncan't be responsible for letting this go on.\"\n\n\"We can't stop, either. There's at least a two months' supply out in the\nhands of jobbers and distributors over whom we have no control. And we\nhave all these contractual obligations, to buy the entire output of the\ncompanies that make the syrup for us; if we stop buying, they can sell\nit in competition with us, as long as they don't infringe our\ntrade-name. And we can't prevent pirating. You know how easily we were\nable to duplicate that sample I brought back from Turkey. Why, our legal\ndepartment's kept busy all the time prosecuting unlicensed manufacturers\nas it is.\"\n\n\"We've got to do something, Fred!\" There was almost a whiff of hysteria\nin Myers' voice.\n\n\"We will. We'll start, first thing tomorrow, on a series of tests--just\nyou and I, like the old times at Eisenhower High. First, we want to\nbe sure that Evri-Flave really is responsible. It'd be a hell of a\nthing if we started a public panic against our own product for nothing.\nAnd then....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt took just two weeks, in a soundproofed and guarded laboratory on\nBenson's Carondelet estate, to convict their delicious drink of\nresponsibility for that Munich State Opera House Horror and everything\nelse. Reports from confidential investigators in Munich confirmed this.\nIt had, of course, been impossible to interview the two thousand men\nand women who had turned the Opera House into a pyre for their own\nimmolation, but none of the tiny minority who had kept their sanity and\nsaved their lives had tasted Evri-Flave.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt took another month to find out exactly how the stuff affected the\nhuman nervous system, and they almost wrecked their own nervous systems\nin the process. The real villain, they discovered, was the\nincredible-looking long-chain compound alluded to in the original notes\nas Ingredient Beta; its principal physiological effect was to greatly\nincrease the sensitivity of the aural nerves. Not only was the hearing\nrange widened--after consuming thirty CC of Beta, they could hear the\nsound of an ultrasonic dog-whistle quite plainly--but the very quality\nof all audible sounds was curiously enhanced and altered. Myers, the\npsychologist, who was also well grounded in neurology, explained how the\nchemical produced this effect; it meant about as much to Benson as some\nof his chemistry did to Bill Myers. There was also a secondary, purely\npsychological, effect. Certain musical chords had definite effects on\nthe emotions of the hearer, and the subject, beside being directly\ninfluenced by the music, was rendered extremely open to verbal\nsuggestions accompanied by a suitable musical background.\n\nBenson transferred the final results of this stage of the research to\nthe black notebook and burned the scratch-sheets.\n\n\"That's how it happened, then,\" he said. \"The Munich thing was the\nresult of all that G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung music. There was a band at the\nbaseball park in Baltimore. The New Orleans Orgy started while a local\nradio station was broadcasting some of this new dance-music. Look, these\ntone-clusters, here, have a definite sex-excitation effect. This series\nof six chords, which occur in some of the Wagnerian stuff; effect, a\ncombined feeling of godlike isolation and despair. And these consecutive\nfifths--a sense of danger, anger, combativeness. You know, we could work\nout a whole range of emotional stimuli to fit the effects of Ingredient\nBeta....\"\n\n\"We don't want to,\" Myers said. \"We want to work out a substitute for\nBeta that will keep the flavor of the drink without the\npsycho-physiological effects.\"\n\n\"Yes, sure. I have some of the boys at the plant lab working on that.\nGave them a lot of syrup without Beta, and told them to work out cheap\nadditives to restore the regular Evri-Flave taste; told them it was an\neffort to find a cheap substitute for an expensive ingredient. But look,\nBill. You and I both see, for instance, that a powerful world-wide\nsupra-national sovereignty is the only guarantee of world peace. If we\ncould use something like this to help overcome antiquated verbal\nprejudices and nationalistic emotional attachments....\"\n\n\"No!\" Myers said. \"I won't ever consent to anything like that, Fred! Not\neven in a cause like world peace; use a thing like this for a good,\nalmost holy, cause now, and tomorrow we, or those who would come after\nus, would be using it to create a tyranny. You know what year this is,\nBill?\"\n\n\"Why, 1984,\" Benson said.\n\n\"Yes. You remember that old political novel of Orwell's, written about\nforty years ago? Well, that's a picture of the kind of world you'd have,\neventually, no matter what kind of a world you started out to make.\nFred, don't ever think of using this stuff for a purpose like that. If\nyou try it, I'll fight you with every resource I have.\"\n\nThere was a fanatical, almost murderous, look in Bill Myers' eyes.\nBenson put the notebook in his pocket, then laughed and threw up his\nhands.\n\n\"Hey, Joe! Hey, Joe!\" he cried. \"You're right, of course, Bill. We can't\neven trust the UN with a thing like this. It makes the H-bomb look like\na stone hatchet.... Well, I'll call Grant, at the plant lab, and see how\nhis boys are coming along with the substitute; as soon as we get it, we\ncan put out a confidential letter to all our distributors and\nsyrup-manufacturers....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe walked alone in the garden at Carondelet, watching the color fade out\nof the sky and the twilight seep in among the clipped yews. All the\nworld could be like this garden, a place of peace and beauty and quiet,\nif only.... All the world _would_ be a beautiful and peaceful garden, in\nhis own lifetime! He had the means of making it so!\n\nThree weeks later, he murdered his friend and partner, Bill Myers. It\nwas a suicide; nobody but Fred Benson knew that he had taken fifty CC of\npure Ingredient Beta in a couple of cocktails while listening to the\nqueer phonograph record that he had played half an hour before blowing\nhis brains out.\n\nThe decision had cost Benson a battle with his conscience from which he\nhad emerged the sole survivor. The conscience was buried along with Bill\nMyers, and all that remained was a purpose.\n\nEvri-Flave stayed on the market unaltered. The night before the national\nelection, the World Sovereignty party distributed thousands of gallons\nof Evri-Flave; their speakers, on every radio and television network,\nwere backgrounded by soft music. The next day, when the vote was\ncounted, it was found that the American Nationalists had carried a few\nbackwoods precincts in the Rockies and the Southern Appalachians and one\ncounty in Alaska, where there had been no distribution of Evri-Flave.\n\nThe dreams came back more often, now that Bill Myers was gone. Benson\nwas only beginning to realize what a large fact in his life the\ncompanionship of the young psychologist had been. Well, a world of peace\nand beauty was an omelet worth the breaking of many eggs....\n\nHe purchased another great tract of land near the city, and donated it\nto the UN for their new headquarters buildings; the same architects and\nlandscapists who had created the estate at Carondelet were put to work\non it. In the middle of what was to become World City, they erected a\nsmall home for Fred Benson. Benson was often invited to address the\ndelegates to the UN; always, there was soft piped-in music behind his\nwords. He saw to it that Evri-Flave was available free to all UN\npersonnel. The Senate of the United States elected him as perpetual\nU. S. delegate-in-chief to the UN; not long after, the Security Council\nelected him their perpetual chairman.\n\nIn keeping with his new dignities, and to ameliorate his youthful\nappearance, he grew a mustache and, eventually, a small beard. The black\nnotebook in which he kept the records of his experiments was always with\nhim; page after page was filled with notes. Experiments in sonics, like\nthe one which had produced the ultrasonic stun-gun which rendered lethal\nweapons unnecessary for police and defense purposes, or the new musical\ncombinations with which he was able to play upon every emotion and\ninstinct.\n\nBut he still dreamed, the same recurring dream of the young soldier and\nthe old man in the office. By now, he was consistently identifying\nhimself with the latter. He took to carrying one of the thick-barrelled\nstun-pistols always, now. Alone, he practiced constantly with it,\ndrawing, breaking soap-bubbles with the concentrated sound-waves it\nprojected. It was silly, perhaps, but it helped him in his dreams. Now,\nthe old man with whom he identified himself would draw a stun-pistol,\noccasionally, to defend himself.\n\nThe years drained one by one through the hour-glass of Time. Year after\nyear, the world grew more peaceful, more beautiful. There were no more\nincidents like the mass-suicide of Munich or the mass-perversions of New\nOrleans; the playing and even the composing of music was strictly\ncontrolled--no dangerous notes or chords could be played in a world\ndrenched with Ingredient Beta. Steadily the idea grew that peace and\nbeauty were supremely good, that violence and ugliness were supremely\nevil. Even competitive sports which simulated violence; even children\nborn ugly and misshapen....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe finished the breakfast which he had prepared for himself--he trusted\nno food that another had touched--and knotted the vivid blue scarf about\nhis neck before slipping into the loose coat of glossy plum-brown, then\nchecked the stun-pistol and pocketed the black notebook, its\nplastileather cover glossy from long use. He stood in front of the\nmirror, brushing his beard, now snow-white. Two years, now, and he would\nbe eighty--had he been anyone but The Guide, he would have long ago\nretired to the absolute peace and repose of one of the Elders' Havens.\nPeace and repose, however, were not for The Guide; it would take another\ntwenty years to finish his task of remaking the world, and he would need\nevery day of it that his medical staff could borrow or steal for him. He\nmade an eye-baffling practice draw with the stun-pistol, then holstered\nit and started down the spiral stairway to the office below.\n\nThere was the usual mass of papers on his desk. A corps of secretaries\nhad screened out everything but what required his own personal and\nimmediate attention, but the business of guiding a world could only be\nreduced to a certain point. On top was the digest of the world's news\nfor the past twenty-four hours, and below that was the agenda for the\nafternoon's meeting of the Council. He laid both in front of him,\nreading over the former and occasionally making a note on the latter.\nOnce his glance strayed to the cardboard box in front of him, with the\nenvelope taped to it--the latest improvement on the Evri-Flave syrup,\nwith the report from his own chemists, all conditioned to obedience,\nloyalty and secrecy. If they thought he was going to try that damned\nstuff on himself....\n\nThere was a sudden gleam of light in the middle of the room, in front of\nhis desk. No, a mist, through which a blue light seemed to shine. The\nstun-pistol was in his hand--his instinctive reaction to anything\nunusual--and pointed into the shining mist when it vanished and a man\nappeared in front of him; a man in the baggy green combat-uniform that\nhe himself had worn fifty years before; a man with a heavy automatic\npistol in his hand. The gun was pointed directly at him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Guide aimed quickly and pressed the trigger of the ultrasonic\nstunner. The pistol dropped soundlessly on the thick-piled rug; the man\nin uniform slumped in an inert heap. The Guide sprang to his feet and\nrounded the desk, crossing to and bending over the intruder. Why, this\nwas the dream that had plagued him through the years. But it was ending\ndifferently. The young man--his face was startlingly familiar,\nsomehow--was not killing the old man. Those years of practice with the\nstun-pistol....\n\nHe stooped and picked the automatic up. The young man was unconscious,\nand The Guide had his pistol, now. He slipped the automatic into his\npocket and straightened beside his inert would-be slayer.\n\nA shimmering globe of blue mist appeared around them, brightened to a\ndazzle, and dimmed again to a colored mist before it vanished, and when\nit cleared away, he was standing beside the man in uniform, in the sandy\nbed of a dry stream at the mouth of a little ravine, and directly in\nfront of him, looming above him, was a thing that had not been seen in\nthe world for close to half a century--a big, hot-smelling tank with a\nred star on its turret.\n\nHe might have screamed--the din of its treads and engines deafened\nhim--and, in panic, he turned and ran, his old legs racing, his old\nheart pumping madly. The noise of the tank increased as machine guns\njoined the uproar. He felt the first bullet strike him, just above the\nhips--no pain; just a tremendous impact. He might have felt the second\nbullet, too, as the ground tilted and rushed up at his face. Then he was\ndiving into a tunnel of blackness that had no end....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCaptain Fred Benson, of Benson's Butchers, had been jerked back into\nconsciousness when the field began to build around him. He was\nstruggling to rise, fumbling the grenade out of his pocket, when it\ncollapsed. Sure enough, right in front of him, so close that he could\nsmell the very heat of it, was the big tank with the red star on its\nturret. He cursed the sextet of sanctimonious double-crossers eight\nthousand miles and fifty years away in space-time. The machine guns had\nstopped--probably because they couldn't be depressed far enough to aim\nat him, now; that was a notorious fault of some of the newer Pan-Soviet\ntanks. He had the bomb out of his pocket, when the machine guns began\nfiring again, this time at something on his left. Wondering what had\ncreated the diversion, he rocked back on his heels, pressed the button,\nand heaved, closing his eyes. As the thing left his fingers, he knew\nthat he had thrown too hard. His muscles, accustomed to the heavier\ncast-iron grenades, had betrayed him. For a moment, he was closer to\ndespair than at any other time in the whole phantasmagoric adventure.\nThen he was hit, with physical force, by a wave of almost solid heat. It\ndidn't smell like the heat of the tank's engines; it smelled like molten\nmetal, with undertones of burned flesh. Immediately, there was a\nmultiple explosion that threw him flat, as the tank's ammunition went\nup. There were no screams. It was too fast for that. He opened his eyes.\n\nThe turret and top armor of the tank had vanished. The two massive\ntreads had been toppled over, one to either side. The body had collapsed\nbetween them, and it was running sticky trickles of molten metal. He\nblinked, rubbed his eyes on the back of his hand, and looked again. Of\nall the many blasted and burned-out tanks, Soviet and UN, that he had\nseen, this was the most completely wrecked thing in his experience. And\nhe'd done that with one grenade....\n\nRemembering the curious manner in which, at the last, the tank had begun\nfiring at something to the side, he looked around, to see the crumpled\nbody in the pale violet-gray trousers and the plum-brown coat. Finding\nhis carbine and reloading it, he went over to the dead man, turning the\nbody over. He was an old man, with a white mustache and a small white\nbeard--why, if the mustache were smaller and there were no beard, he\nwould pass for Benson's own father, who had died in 1962. The clothes\nweren't Turkish or Armenian or Persian, or anything one would expect in\nthis country.\n\nThe old man had a pistol in his coat pocket, and Benson pulled it out\nand looked at it, then did a double-take and grabbed for his own\nholster, to find it empty. The pistol was his own 9.5 Colt automatic. He\nlooked at the dead man, with the white beard and the vivid blue\nneck-scarf, and he was sure that he had never seen him before. He'd had\nthat pistol when he'd come down the ravine....\n\nThere was another pistol under the dead man's coat, in a\nshoulder-holster; a queer thing with a thick round barrel, like an old\npercussion pepper-box, and a diaphragm instead of a muzzle. Probably\nprojected ultrasonic waves. He holstered his own Colt and pocketed the\nunknown weapon. There was a black plastileather-bound notebook. It was\nfull of notes. Chemical formulae, yes, and some stuff on sonics; that\ntied in with the queer pistol. He pocketed that. He'd look both over,\nwhen he had time and privacy, two scarce commodities in the Army....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt that moment, there was a sudden rushing overhead, and an instant\nlater, the barrage began falling beyond the crest of the ridge. He\nlooked at his watch, blinked, and looked again. That barrage was due at\n0550; according to his watch, it was 0726. That was another mystery, to\ngo with the question of who the dead man was, where he had come from,\nand how he'd gotten hold of Benson's pistol. Yes, and how that tank had\ngotten blown up. Benson was sure he had used his last grenade back at\nthe supply-dump.\n\nThe hell with it; he'd worry about all that later. The attack was due\nany minute, now, and there would be fleeing Commies coming up the valley\nahead, of the UN advance. He'd better get himself placed before they\nstarted coming in on him.\n\nHe stopped thinking about the multiple mystery, a solution to which\nseemed to dance maddeningly just out of his mental reach, and found\nhimself a place among the rocks to wait, and while he waited, he looked\nover the plastileather-bound notebook. In civil life, he had been a\nhigh school chemistry teacher, but the stuff in this book was utterly\nnew to him. Some of it he could understand readily enough; the rest of\nit he could dig out for himself. Stuff about some kind of a carbonated\nsoft-drink, and about a couple of unbelievable-looking long-chain\nmolecules....\n\nAfter a while, fugitive Communists began coming up the valley to make\ntheir stand.\n\nBenson put away the notebook, picked up his carbine, and cuddled the\nstock to his cheek....\n\n\nTHE END\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------+\n|                                                              |\n|                      Transcriber's Note                      |\n|                                                              |\n| Bold text was surrounded by '+' symbols.                     |\n|                                                              |\n| One \"onionskin\" was converted to \"onion-skin\" to conform     |\n| with the majority usage in the text.                         |\n|                                                              |\n| \"rebuilds\" and \"re-builds\" were left alone as there was no   |\n| predominant usage                                            |\n|                                                              |\n| The following typos were corrected:                          |\n|                                                              |\n| benificence  beneficence                                     |\n| lethel       lethal                                          |\n| \"See         See                                             |\n| tyranical    tyrannical                                      |\n|                                                              |\n| Subscripts                                                   |\n|                                                              |\n| Water was shown as H_{2}O, and                               |\n| Sulfuric acid   as H_{2}SO_{4}                               |\n|                                                              |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Hunter Patrol, by \nHenry Beam Piper and John J.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n*** END: FULL LICENSE ***\n"}
