Then I folded it up, put it\nin my pocket, and pressed the little button on my desk. My mind was\nmade up.\n\n\"Miss Fentress, I'm leaving this afternoon on an extended trip. The\nFlorida address will reach me after Thursday. Tell Wade and Bennett to\ncarry on. I think you have everything in hand? Is everything clear to\nyou?\"\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Taylor.\" Miss Fentress was not in the least surprised. She\nwas used to my sudden trips. The outfit got along perfectly without\nme; sometimes I think my frequent absences are good for the business.\nThe boys work like the devil to make a fine showing while I'm away.\nAnd Miss Fentress is a perfect gem of a secretary. I had nothing to\nworry about there.\n\n\"Fine! Will you get my diggings on the phone?\" I hurriedly put my few\npapers in place, and signed a couple of letters. Then Josef was on the\nwire.\n\n\"Josef? Pack my bags right away, will you? For Florida. The usual\nthings.... Yes, right away. I'll be leaving by noon.... Yes, driving\nthrough.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat was that. There were a few more letters to sign, a few hasty\ninstructions to be given regarding one or two matters that were\nhanging fire. Then, on my way to my bachelor apartments, I read the\ntelegram through again:\n\n     THINK IT WORTH WHILE IF YOU FEEL ADVENTUROUS AND HAVE\n     NOTHING PRESSING TO COME TO THE MONSTROSITY STOP MAKE YOUR\n     WILL FIRST STOP SHALL LOOK FOR YOU ANY DAY AS I KNOW YOU ARE\n     ALWAYS LOOKING FOR EXCITEMENT AND NEVER HAVE ANYTHING\n     IMPORTANT TO DO SO DON'T BOTHER TO WIRE STOP PERHAPS WE\n     SHALL SEE HER AGAIN\n\n                                                       MERCER\n\nI smiled at Mercer's frank opinion of my disposition and my importance\nto my business. But I frowned over the admonition to make my will, and\nthe last telling statement in the wire: \"Perhaps we shall see her\nagain.\" I knew whom he meant by \"her.\"\n\nJosef had my bags waiting for me. A few hurried instructions, most of\nthem shouted over my shoulder, and I was purring down the main drag,\nmy duffel in the rumble, and the roadster headed due south.\n\n\"Perhaps we shall see her again.\" Those words from the telegram kept\ncoming before my eyes. Mercer knew what he was about, if he wanted my\ncompany, when he put that line in his wire.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI have already told the story of our first meeting with the strange\nbeing from the ocean's depths that, wounded and senseless, had been\nflung up on the beach near Warren Mercer's Florida estate. In all the\nhistory of civilization, no stranger bit of flotsam had ever been cast\nup by a storm.\n\nNeither of us would ever forget that slim white creature, swathed in\nher veil of long, light golden hair, as she crouched on the bottom of\nMercer's swimming pool, and pictured for us, by means of Mercer's\nthought-telegraph (my own name for the device; he has a long and\nscientific title for it with as many joints as a centipede), the story\nof her people.\n\nThey had lived in a country of steaming mist, when the world was very\nyoung. They had been forced into the sea to obtain food, and after\nmany generations they had gone back to the sea as man once emerged\nfrom it. They had grown webs on their hands and feet, and they\nbreathed oxygen dissolved in water, as fishes do, instead of taking it\nfrom the atmosphere. And under the mighty Atlantic, somewhere, were\ntheir villages.\n\nThe girl had pictured all these things for us, and then--nearly a year\nago, now--she had pleaded with us to let her return to her people. And\nso we had put her back into the sea, and she had bade us farewell. But\njust before she disappeared, she had done a strange thing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe had pointed, under the water, out towards the depth, and then,\nwith a broad, sweeping motion of her arm, she had indicated the shore,\nas though to promise, it seemed to me, that she intended to return.\n\nAnd now, Mercer said, we might see her again! How? Mercer,\nconservative and scientific, was not the man to make rash promises.\nBut how...?\n\nThe best way to solve the riddle was to reach Mercer, and I broke the\nspeed laws of five states three days running.\n\nI did not even stop at my own little shack. It was only four miles\nfrom there to the huge, rather neglected estate, built in boom times\nby some newly-rich promoter, and dubbed by Mercer \"The Monstrosity.\"\n\nHardly bothering to slow down, I turned off the concrete onto the\nlong, weed-grown gravel drive, and shot between the two massive,\nstuccoed pillars that guarded the drive. Their corroded bronze plates,\nbearing the original title of the estate, \"The Billows,\" were a\npromise that my long, hard drive was nearly at an end.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs soon as the huge, rambling structure was fairly in sight, I pressed\nthe flat of my hand on the horn button. By the time I came to a\nlocked-wheel halt, with the gravel rattling on my fenders, Mercer was\nthere to greet me.\n\n\"It's ten o'clock,\" he grinned as he shook hands. \"I'd set noon as the\nhour of your arrival. You certainly must have made time, Taylor!\"\n\n\"I did!\" I nodded rather grimly, recalling one or two narrow squeaks.\n\"But who wouldn't, with a wire like this?\" I produced the crumpled\ntelegram rather dramatically. \"You've got a lot to explain.\"\n\n\"I know it.\" Mercer was quite serious now. \"Come on in and we'll mix\nhighballs with the story.\"\n\nLocked arm in arm, we entered the house together, and settled\nourselves in the huge living room.\n\nMercer, I could see at a glance, was thinner and browner than when we\nhad parted, but otherwise, he was the same lithe, soft-mannered little\nscientist I had known for years; dark-eyed, with an almost beautiful\nmouth, outlined by a slim, closely cropped and very black moustache.\n\n\"Well, here's to our lady from the sea,\" proposed Mercer, when Carson,\nhis man, had brought the drinks and departed. I nodded, and we both\nsipped our highballs.\n\n\"Briefly,\" said my friend, \"this is the story. You and I know that\nsomewhere beneath the Atlantic there are a people who went back to\nwhence they came. We have seen one of those people. I propose that,\nsince they cannot come to us, we go to them. I have made preparations\nto go to them, and I wanted you to have the opportunity of going with\nme, if you wish.\"\n\n\"But how, Mercer? And what--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe interrupted with a quick, nervous gesture.\n\n\"I'll show you, presently. I believe it can be done. It will be a\ndangerous adventure, though; I was not joking when I advised you to\nmake your will. An uncertain venture, too. But, I believe, most\nwonderfully worth while.\" His eyes were shining now with all the\nenthusiasm of the scientist, the dreamer.\n\n\"It sounds mighty appealing,\" I said. \"But how....\"\n\n\"Finish your drink and I'll show you.\"\n\nI downed what was left of my highball in two mighty gulps.\n\n\"Lead me to it, Mercer!\"\n\nHe smiled his quiet smile and led the way to what had been the\nbilliard room of \"The Billows,\" but which was the laboratory of \"The\nMonstrosity.\" The first thing my eyes fell upon were two gleaming\nmetal objects suspended from chains let into the ceiling.\n\n\"Diving suits,\" explained Mercer. \"Rather different from anything\nyou've ever seen.\"\n\nThey were different. The body was a perfect globe, as was the\nhead-piece. The legs were cylindrical, jointed at knee and thigh with\nhuge discs. The feet were solid metal, curved rocker-like on the\nbottom, and at the ends of the arms were three hooked talons, the\nconcave sides of two talons facing the concave side of the third. The\narms were hinged at the elbow just as the legs were hinged, but there\nwas a huge ball-and-socket joint at the shoulder.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"But Mercer!\" I protested. \"No human being could even stand up with\nthat weight of metal on and around him!\"\n\n\"You're mistaken, Taylor,\" smiled Mercer. \"That is not solid metal,\nyou see. And it is an aluminum alloy that is not nearly as heavy as it\nlooks. There are two walls, slightly over an inch apart, braced by\ninnumerable trusses. The fabric is nearly as strong as that much solid\nmetal, and infinitely lighter. They work all right, Taylor. I know,\nbecause I've tried them.\"\n\n\"And this hump on the back?\" I asked, walking around the odd, dangling\nfigures, hanging like bloated metal skeletons from their chains. I\nhad thought the bodies were perfect globes; I could see now that at\nthe rear there was a humplike excrescence across the shoulders.\n\n\"Air,\" explained Mercer. \"There are two other tanks inside the\nglobular body. That shape was adopted, by the way, because a globe can\nwithstand more pressure than any other shape. And we may have to go\nwhere pressures are high.\"\n\n\"And so,\" I said, \"we don these things and stroll out into the\nAtlantic looking for the girl and her friends?\"\n\n\"Hardly. They're not quite the apparel for so long a stroll. You\nhaven't seen all the marvels yet. Come along!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe led the way through the patio, beside the pool in which our strange\nvisitor from the depths had lived during her brief stay with us, and\nout into the open again. As we neared the sea, I became aware, for the\nfirst time, of a faint, muffled hammering sound, and I glanced at\nMercer inquiringly.\n\n\"Just a second,\" he smiled. \"Then--there she is, Taylor!\"\n\nI stood still and stared. In a little cove, cradled in a cunning,\nspidery structure of wood, a submarine rested upon the ways.\n\n\"Good Lord!\" I exclaimed. \"You're going into this right, Mercer!\"\n\n\"Yes. Because I think it's immensely worth while. But come along and\nlet me show you the _Santa Maria_--named after the flagship of\nColumbus' little fleet. Come on!\"\n\nTwo men with army automatics strapped significantly to their belts\nnodded courteously as we came up. They were the only men in sight, but\nfrom the hammering going on inside there must have been quite a\nsizeable crew busy in the interior. A couple of raw pine shacks, some\nlittle distance away, provided quarters for, I judged, twenty or\nthirty men.\n\n\"Had her shipped down in pieces,\" explained Mercer. \"The boat that\nbrought it lay to off shore and we lightered the parts ashore. A\ntremendous job. But she'll be ready for the water in a week; ten days\nat the latest.\"\n\n\"You're a wonder,\" I said, and I meant it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMercer patted the red-leaded side of the submarine affectionately.\n\"Later,\" he said, \"I'll take you inside, but they're busy as the devil\nin there, and the sound of the hammers fairly makes your head ring.\nYou'll see it all later, anyway--if you feel you'd like to share the\nadventure with me?\"\n\n\"Listen,\" I grinned as we turned back towards the house, \"it'll take\nmore than those two lads with the pop-guns to keep me out of the\n_Santa Maria_ when she sails--or dives, or whatever it is she's\nsupposed to do!\"\n\nMercer laughed softly, and we walked the rest of the way in silence. I\nimagine we were both pretty busy with our thoughts; I know that I was.\nAnd several times, as we walked along, I looked back over my shoulder\ntowards the ungainly red monster straddling on her spindling wooden\nlegs--and towards the smiling Atlantic, glistening serenely in the\nsun.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMercer was so busy with a thousand and one details that I found myself\nvery much in the way if I followed him around, so I decided to loaf.\n\nFor weeks after we had put our strange girl visitor back into the sea\nfrom whence Mercer had taken her, I had watched from a comfortable\nseat well above the high-water mark that commanded that section of\nshore. For I had felt sure by that last strange gesture of hers that\nshe meant to return.\n\nI located my old seat, and I found that it had been used a great deal\nsince I had left it. There were whole winnows of cigarette butts, some\nof them quite fresh, all around. Mercer, cold-blooded scientist as he\nwas, had hoped against hope that she would return too.\n\nIt was a very comfortable seat, in the shade of a little cluster of\npalms, and for the next several days I spent most of my time there,\nreading and smoking--and watching. No matter how interesting the book,\nI found myself, every few seconds, lifting my eyes to search the beach\nand the sea.\n\nI am not sure, but I think it was the eighth day after my arrival that\nI looked up and saw, for the first time, something besides the smiling\nbeach and the ceaseless procession of incoming rollers. For an instant\nI doubted what I saw; then, with a cry that stuck in my throat, I\ndropped my book unheeded to the sand and raced towards the shore.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe was there! White and slim, her pale gold hair clinging to her body\nand gleaming like polished metal in the sun, she stood for a moment,\nwhile the spray frothed at her thighs. Behind her, crouching below the\nsurface, I could distinguish two other forms. She had returned, and\nnot alone!\n\nOne long, slim arm shot out toward me, held level with the shoulder:\nthe well-remembered gesture of greeting. Then she too crouched below\nthe surface that she might breathe.\n\nAs I ran out onto the wet sand, the waves splashing around my ankles\nall unheeded, she rose again, and now I could see her lovely smile,\nand her dark, glowing eyes. I was babbling--I do not know what. Before\nI could reach her, she smiled and sank again below the surface.\n\nI waded on out, laughing excitedly, and as I came close to her, she\nbobbed up again out of the spray, and we greeted each other in the\nmanner of her people, hands outstretched, each gripping the shoulder\nof the other.\n\nShe made a quick motion then, with both hands, as though she placed a\ncap upon the shining glory of her head, and I understood in an instant\nwhat she wished: the antenna of Mercer's thought-telegraph, by the\naid of which she had told us the story of herself and her people.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI nodded and smiled, and pointed to the spot where she stood, trying\nto show her by my expression that I understood, and by my gesture,\nthat she was to wait here for me. She smiled and nodded in return, and\ncrouched again below the surface of the heaving sea.\n\nAs I turned toward the beach, I caught a momentary glimpse of the two\nwho had come with her. They were a man and a woman, watching me with\nwide, half-curious, half-frightened eyes. I recognized them instantly\nfrom the picture she had impressed upon my mind nearly a year ago. She\nhad brought with her on her journey her mother and her father.\n\nStumbling, my legs shaking with excitement, I ran through the water.\nWith my wet trousers flapping against my ankles, I sprinted towards\nthe house.\n\nI found Mercer in the laboratory. He looked up as I came rushing in,\nwet from the shoulders down, and I saw his eyes grow suddenly wide.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI opened my mouth to speak, but I was breathless. And Mercer took the\nwords from my mouth before I could utter them.\n\n\"She's come back!\" he cried. \"She's come back! Taylor--she has?\" He\ngripped me, his fingers like steel clamps, shaking me with his amazing\nstrength.\n\n\"Yes.\" I found my breath and my voice at the same instant. \"She's\nthere, just where we put her into the sea, and there are two others\nwith her--her mother and her father. Come on, Mercer, and bring your\nthought gadget!\"\n\n\"I can't!\" he groaned. \"I've built an improvement on it into the\ndiving armor, and a central instrument on the sub, but the old\napparatus is strewn all over the table, here, just as it was when we\nused it the other time. We'll have to bring her here.\"\n\n\"Get a basin, then!\" I said. \"We'll carry her back to the pool just as\nwe took her from it. Hurry!\"\n\nAnd we did just that. Mercer snatched up a huge glass basin used in\nhis chemistry experiments, and we raced down to the shore. As well as\nwe could we explained our wishes, and she smiled her quick smile of\nunderstanding. Crouching beneath the water, she turned to her\ncompanions, and I could see her throat move as she spoke to them. They\nseemed to protest, dubious and frightened, but in the end she seemed\nto reassure them, and we picked her up, swathed in her hair as in a\nsilken gown, and carried her, her head immersed in the basin of water,\nthat she might breathe in comfort, to the pool.\n\nIt all took but a few minutes, but it seemed hours. Mercer's hands\nwere shaking as he handed me the antenna for the girl and another for\nmyself, and his teeth were chattering as he spoke.\n\n\"Hurry, Taylor!\" he said. \"I've set the switch so that she can do the\nsending, while we receive. Quickly, man!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI leaped into the pool and adjusted the antenna on her head, making\nsure that the four electrodes of the crossed curved members pressed\nagainst the front and back and both sides of her head. Then, hastily,\nI climbed out of the pool, seated myself on its edge, and put on my\nown antenna.\n\nPerhaps I should say at this time that Mercer's device for conveying\nthought could do no more than convey what was in the mind of the\nperson sending. Mercer and I could convey actual words and sentences,\nbecause we understood each other's language, and by thinking in words,\nwe conveyed our thoughts in words. One received the impression,\nalmost, of having heard actual speech.\n\nWe could not communicate with the girl in this fashion, however, for\nwe did not understand her speech. She had to convey her thoughts to\nus by means of mental pictures which told her story. And this is the\nstory of her pictures unfolded.\n\nFirst, in sketchy, half-formed pictures, I saw her return to the\nvillage, of her people; her welcome there, with curious crowds around\nher, questioning her. Their incredulous expressions as she told them\nof her experience were ludicrous. Her meeting with her father and\nmother brought a little catch to my throat, and I looked across the\npool at Mercer. I knew that he, too, was glad that we bad put her back\ninto the sea when she wished to go.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThese pictures faded hastily, and for a moment there was only the\ncircular swirling as of gray mist; that was the symbol she adopted to\ndenote the passing of time. Then, slowly, the picture cleared.\n\nIt was the same village I had seen before, with its ragged, warped,\nnarrow streets, and its row of dome-shaped houses, for all the world\nlike Eskimo igloos, but made of coral and various forms of vegetation.\nAt the outskirts of the village I could see the gently moving, shadowy\nforms of weird submarine growths, and the quick darting shapes of\ninnumerable fishes.\n\nSome few people were moving along the streets, walking with oddly\nspringy steps. Others, a larger number, darted here and there above\nthe roofs, some hovering in the water as gulls hover in the air,\nlazily, but the majority apparently on business or work to be executed\nwith dispatch.\n\nSuddenly, into the midst of this peaceful scene, three figures came\ndarting. They were not like the people of the village, for they were\nsmaller, and instead of being gracefully slim they were short and\npowerful in build. They were not white like the people of the girl's\nvillage, but swarthy, and they were dressed in a sort of tight-fitting\nshirt of gleaming leather--shark-skin, I learned later. They carried,\ntucked through a sort of belt made of twisted vegetation, two long,\nslim knives of pointed stone or bone.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut it was not until they seemed to come close to me that I saw the\ngreat point of difference. Their faces were scarcely human. The nose\nhad become rudimentary, leaving a large, blank expanse in the middle\nof their faces that gave them a peculiarly hideous expression. Their\neyes were almost perfectly round, and very fierce, and their mouths\nhuge and fishlike. Beneath their sharp, jutting jaws, between the\nangle of the jaws and a spot beneath the ears, were huge, longitudinal\nslits, that intermittently showed blood-red, like fresh gashes cut in\nthe sides of their throats. I could see even the hard, bony cover that\nprotected these slits, and I realized that these were gills! Here were\nrepresentatives of a people that had gone back to the sea ages before\nthe people of the girl's village.\n\nTheir coming caused a sort of panic in the village, and the three\nnoseless creatures strode down the principal street grinning hugely,\nglancing from right to left, and showing their sharp pointed teeth.\nThey looked more like sharks than like human beings.\n\nA committee of five gray old men met the visitors, and conducted them\ninto one of the larger houses. Insolently, the leader of the three\nshark-faced creatures made demands, and the scene changed swiftly to\nmake clear the nature of those demands.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe village was to give a number of its finest young men and women to\nthe shark-faced people; about fifty of each sex, I gathered, to be\nservants, slaves, to the noseless ones.\n\nThe scene shifted quickly to the interior of the house. The old men\nwere shaking their heads, protesting, explaining. There was fear on\ntheir faces, but there was determination, too.\n\nOne of the three envoys snarled and came closer to the five old men,\nlifting a knife threateningly. I thought for an instant that he was\nabout to strike down one of the villagers; then the picture dissolved\ninto another, and I saw that he was but threatening them with what he\ncould cause to happen.\n\nThe fate of the village and the villagers, were the demands of the\nthree refused, was a terrible one. Hordes of the noseless creatures\ncame swarming. They tore the houses apart, and with their long, slim\nwhite weapons they killed the old men and women, and the children. The\nvillagers fought desperately, but they were outnumbered. The\nshark-skin kirtles of the invaders turned their knives like armor, and\nthe sea grew red with swirling blood that spread like scarlet smoke\nthrough the water. Then, this too faded, and I saw the old men\ncowering, pleading with the three terrible envoys.\n\nThe leader of the three shark-faced creatures spoke again. He would\ngive them time--a short revolving swirl of gray that indicated only a\nbrief time, apparently--and return for an answer. Grinning evilly, the\nthree turned away, left the dome-shaped house, and darted away over\nthe roofs of the village into the dim darkness of the distant waters.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI saw the girl, then, talking to the elders. They smiled sadly, and\nshook their heads hopelessly. She argued with them earnestly, painting\na picture for them: Mercer and myself, as she viewed us, tall and very\nstrong and with great wisdom in our faces. We too walked along the\nstreets of the village. The hordes of shark-faced ones came, like a\nswarm of monstrous sharks, and--the picture was very vague and\nnebulous, now--we put them to rout.\n\nShe wished us to help her, she had convinced the elders that we could.\nShe, her mother and father, started out from the village. Three times\nthey had fought with sharks, and each time they had killed them. They\nhad found the shore, the very spot where we had put her back into the\nsea. Then there was a momentary flash of the picture she had called\nup, of Mercer and I putting the shark-faced hordes to rout, and then,\nstartlingly, I was conscious of that high, pleading sound--the sound\nthat I had heard once before, when she had begged us to return her to\nher people.\n\nThe sound that I knew was her word for \"_Please!_\"\n\nThere was a little click. Mercer had turned the switch. He would\ntransmit now; she and I would listen.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the center of the village--how vaguely and clumsily he pictured\nit!--rested the _Santa Maria_. From a trap in the bottom two bulging,\ngleaming figures emerged. Rushing up, a glimpse through the\nface-plates revealed Mercer and myself. The shark-faced hordes\ndescended, and Mercer waved something, something like a huge bottle,\ntowards them. None of the villagers were in sight.\n\nThe noseless ones swooped down on us fearlessly, knives drawn, pointed\nteeth revealed in fiendish grins. But they did not reach us. By\ndozens, by scores, they went limp and floated slowly to the floor of\nthe ocean. Their bodies covered the streets, they sprawled across the\nroofs of the houses. And in a few seconds there was not one alive of\nall the hundreds who had come!\n\nI looked down at the girl. She was smiling up at me through the clear\nwater, and once again I felt the strange, strong tug at my\nheart-strings. Her great dark eyes glowed with a perfect confidence, a\nsupreme faith.\n\nWe had made her a promise.\n\nI wondered if it would be possible to keep it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the day following, the _Santa Maria_ was launched. Two days later,\ntrial trips and final adjustments completed, we submerged for the\ngreat adventure.\n\nIt sounds very simple when recorded thus in a few brief lines. It was\nnot, however, such a simple matter. Those three days were full of\nhectic activity. Mercer and I did not sleep more than four hours any\nof those three nights.\n\nWe were too busy to talk. Mercer worked frantically in his laboratory,\nslaving feverishly beside the big hood. I overlooked the tests of the\nsubmarine and the loading of the necessary supplies.\n\nThe girl we had taken back to her parents, giving her to understand\nthat she was to wait. They went away, but every few hours returned, as\nthough to urge us to greater haste. And at last we were ready, and the\ngirl and her two companions seated themselves on the tiny deck of the\n_Santa Maria_, just forward of the conning tower, holding themselves\nin place by the chains. We had already instructed the girl in her\nduties: we would move slowly, and she should guide us, by pointing\neither to the right or the left.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI will confess I gave a last long, lingering look at the shore before\nthe hatch of the conning tower was clamped down. I was not exactly\nafraid, but I wondered if I would ever step foot on solid land again.\n\nStanding in the conning tower beside Mercer, I watched the sea rise at\nan angle to meet us, and I dodged instinctively as the first green\nwave pelted against the thick porthole through which I was looking. An\ninstant later the water closed over the top of the conning tower, and\nat a gentle angle we nosed towards the bottom of the sea.\n\nAn account of the trip itself, perhaps, does not belong in this\nrecord. It was not a pleasant adventure in itself, for the _Santa\nMaria_, like every undersea craft, I suppose, was close, smelly, and\ncramped. We proceeded very slowly, for only by so doing could our\nguide keep her bearings, and how she found the way was a mystery to\nall of us. We could see but very little, despite the clearness of the\nwater.\n\nIt was by no means a sight-seeing trip. For various reasons, Mercer\nhad cut our crew to the minimum. We had two navigating officers,\nexperienced submarine men both, and five sailors, also experienced in\nundersea work. With such a short crew, Mercer and I were both kept\nbusy.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBonnett, the captain, was a tall, dark chap, stooped from years in the\nlow, cramped quarters of submarines. Duke, our second-officer, was a\nyoungster hardly out of his 'teens, and as clever as they come. And\nalthough both of them, and the crew as well, must have been agog with\nquestions, neither by word nor look did they express their feelings.\nMercer had paid for obedience without curiosity, and he got it.\n\nWe spent the first night on the bottom, for the simple reason that had\nwe come to the surface, we might have come down into territory\nunfamiliar to our guide. As soon as the first faint light began to\nfilter down, however, we proceeded, and Mercer and I crowded together\ninto the conning tower.\n\n\"We're close,\" said Mercer. \"See how excited they are, all three of\nthem.\"\n\nThe three strange creatures were holding onto the chains and staring\nover the bulging side of the ship. Every few seconds the girl turned\nand looked back at us, smiling, her eyes shining with excitement.\nSuddenly she pointed straight down, and held out her arm in\nunmistakable gesture. We were to stop.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMercer conveyed the order instantly to Bonnett at the controls, and\nall three of our guides dived gracefully off the ship and disappeared\ninto the depths below.\n\n\"Let her settle to the bottom, Bonnett,\" ordered Mercer. \"Slowly ...\nslowly....\"\n\nBonnett handled the ship neatly, keeping her nicely trimmed. We came\nto rest on the bottom in four or five seconds, and as Mercer and I\nstared out eagerly through the round glass ports of the conning\ntower, we could see, very dimly, a cluster of dark, rounded\nprojections cropping out from the bed of the ocean. We were only a few\nyards from the edge of the girl's village.\n\nThe scene was exactly as we had pictured it, save that it was not\nnearly as clear and well lighted. I realized that our eyes were not\naccustomed to the gloom, as were those of the girl and her people, but\nI could distinguish the vague outlines of the houses, and the slowly\nswaying shapes of monstrous growths.\n\n\"Well, Taylor,\" said Mercer, his voice shaking with excitement, \"here\nwe are! And here\"--peering out through the glass-covered port\nagain--\"are her people!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe whole village was swarming around us. White bodies hovered around\nus as moths around a light. Faces pressed against the ports and stared\nin at us with great, amazed eyes.\n\nThen, suddenly the crowd of curious creatures parted, and the girl\ncame darting up with the five ancients she had showed us before. They\nwere evidently the council responsible for the government of the\nvillage, or something of the sort, for the other villagers bowed their\nheads respectfully as they passed.\n\nThe girl came close to the port through which I was looking, and\ngestured earnestly. Her face was tense and anxious, and from time to\ntime she glanced over her shoulder, as though she feared the coming of\nan enemy.\n\n\"Our time's short, I take it, if we are to be of service,\" said\nMercer. \"Come on, Taylor; into the diving suits!\"\n\nI signaled the girl that we understood, and would hurry. Then I\nfollowed Mercer into our tiny stateroom.\n\n\"Remember what I've told you,\" he said, as we slipped into the heavy\nwoolen undergarments we were to wear inside the suits. \"You understand\nhow to handle your air, I believe, and you'll have no difficulty\ngetting around in the suit if you'll just remember to go slowly. Your\njob is to get the whole village to get away when the enemy is sighted.\nGet them to come this way from the village, towards the ship,\nunderstand. The current comes from this direction; the way the\nvegetation bends shows that. And keep the girl's people away until I\nsignal you to let them return. And remember to take your electric\nlantern. Don't burn it more than is necessary; the batteries are not\nlarge and the bulb draws a lot of current. Ready?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI was, but I was shaking a little as the men helped me into the mighty\narmor that was to keep the pressure of several atmospheres from\ncrushing my body. The helmet was the last piece to be donned; when it\nwas screwed in place I stood there like a mummy, almost completely\nrigid.\n\nQuickly we were put into the air lock, together with a large iron box\ncontaining a number of things Mercer needed. Darkness and water rushed\nin on us. The water closed over my head. I became aware of the soft,\ncontinuous popping sounds of the air-bubbles escaping from the relief\nvalve of the head-piece.\n\nFor a moment I was dizzy and more than a little nauseated. I could\nfeel the cold sweat pricking my forehead. Then there was a sudden glow\nof light from before me, and I started walking towards it. I found I\ncould walk now; not easily, but, after I caught the trick of it,\nwithout much difficulty. I could move my arms, too, and the\ninterlocking hooks that served me for fingers. When my real fingers\nclosed upon a little cross-bar at the end of the armored arms, and\npulled the bars towards me, the steel claws outside came together,\nlike a thumb and two fingers.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn a moment we stood upon the bottom of the ocean. I turned my head\ninside the helmet, and there, beside me, was the sleek, smooth side\nof the _Santa Maria_. On my other side was Mercer, a huge, dim figure\nin his diving armor. He made an awkward gesture towards his head, and\nI suddenly remembered something.\n\nBefore me, where I could operate it with a thrusting movement of my\nchin, was a toggle switch. I snapped it over, and heard Mercer's\nvoice: \"--n't forget everything I tell him.\"\n\n\"I know it,\" I said mentally to him. \"I was rather rattled. O.K. now,\nhowever. Anything I can do?\"\n\n\"Yes. Help me with this box, and then get the girl to put on the\nantenna you'll find there. Don't forget the knife and the light.\"\n\n\"Right!\" I bent over the box with him, and we both came near falling.\nWe opened the lid, however, and I hooked the knife and the light into\ntheir proper places outside my armor. Then, with the antenna for the\ngirl, so that we could establish connections with her, and through\nher, with the villagers, I moved off.\n\nThis antenna was entirely different from the one used in previous\nexperiments. The four cross-members that clasped the head were finer,\nand at their junction was a flat black circular box, from which rose a\nblack rod some six inches in height, and topped by a black sphere half\nthe size of my fist.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThese perfected thought-telegraphs (I shall continue to use my own\ndesignation for them, as clearer and more understandable than\nMercer's) did not need connecting wires; they conveyed their impulses\nby Hertzian waves to a master receiver on the _Santa Maria_, which\namplified them and re-broadcast them so that each of us could both\nsend and receive at any time.\n\nAs I turned, I found the girl beside me, waiting anxiously. Behind her\nwere the five ancients. I slipped the antenna over her head, and\ninstantly she began telling me that danger was imminent.\n\nTo facilitate matters, I shall describe her messages as though she\nspoke; indeed, her pictures were as clear, almost, as speech in my\nnative tongue. And at times she did use certain sound-words; it was in\nthis way that I learned, by inference, that her name was _Imee_, that\nher people were called _Teemorn_ (this may have been the name of the\ncommunity, or perhaps it was interchangeable--I am not sure) and that\nthe shark-faced people were the _Rorn_.\n\n\"The Rorn come!\" she said quickly. \"Two days past, the three came\nagain, and our old men refused to give up the slaves. Today they will\nreturn, these Rorn, and my people, the Teemorn will all be made dead!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen I told her what Mercer had said: that she and every one of her\npeople must flee swiftly and hide, beyond the boat, a distance beyond\nthe village. Mercer and I would wait here, and when the Rorn came, it\nwas they who would be made dead, as we had promised. Although how, I\nadmitted to myself, being careful to hide the thought that she might\nnot sense it, I didn't know. We had been too busy since the girl's\narrival to go into details.\n\nShe turned and spoke quickly to the old men. They looked at me\ndoubtfully, and she urged them vehemently. They turned back towards\nthe village, and in a moment the Teemorn were stalking by obediently,\nlosing their slim white forms in the gloom behind the dim bulk of the\n_Santa Maria_, resting so quietly on the sand.\n\nThey were hardly out of sight when suddenly Mercer spoke through the\nantenna fitted inside my helmet.\n\n\"They're coming!\" he cried. \"Look above and to your right! The Rorn,\nas Imee calls them, have arrived!\"\n\nI looked up and beheld a hundred--no, a thousand!--shadowy forms\ndarting down on the village, upon us. They, too, were just as the girl\nhad pictured them: short, swart beings with but the suggestion of a\nnose, and with pulsing gill-covers under the angles of their jaws.\nEach one gripped a long, slim white knife in either hand, and their\ntight-fitting shark-skin armor gleamed darkly as they swooped down\nupon us.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEagerly I watched my friend. In the clasping talons of his left hand\nhe held a long, slim flask that glinted even in that dim, confusing\ntwilight. Two others, mates to the first, dangled at his waist.\nLifting it high above his head, he swung his metal-clad right arm, and\nshattered the flask he held in his taloned left hand.\n\nFor an instant nothing happened, save that flittering bits of broken\nglass shimmered their way to the sand. Then the horde of noseless ones\nseemed to dissolve, as hundreds of limp and sprawling bodies sank to\nthe sand. Perhaps a half of that great multitude seemed struck dead.\n\n\"Hydrocyanic acid, Taylor!\" cried Mercer exultantly. \"Even diluted by\nthe sea water, it kills almost instantly. Go back and make sure that\nnone of the girl's people come back before the current has washed this\naway, or they'll go in the same fashion. Warn her to keep them back!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI hurried toward the _Santa Maria_, thinking urgent warnings for\nImee's benefit. \"Stay back! Stay back, Imee! The Rorn are falling to\nthe sand, we have made many of them dead, but the danger for you and\nyour people is still here. Stay back!\"\n\n\"Truly, do the Rorn become dead? I would like to see that with my own\neyes. Be careful that they do not make you dead also, and your friend,\nfor they have large brains, these Rorn.\"\n\n\"Do not come to see with your own eyes, or you will be as the Rorn!\" I\nhurried around the submarine, to keep her back by force, if that were\nnecessary. \"You must--\"\n\n\"Help, Taylor!\" cut in a voice--Mercer's. \"These devils have got me!\"\n\n\"Right with you!\" I turned and hurried back as swiftly as I could,\nstumbling over the bodies of dead Rorn that had settled everywhere on\nthe clean yellow sand.\n\nI found Mercer in the grip of six of the shark-faced creatures. They\nwere trying desperately to stab him, but their knives bent and broke\nagainst the metal of his armor. So busy were they with him that they\ndid not notice me coming up, but finding their weapons useless, they\nsuddenly snatched him up, one at either arm and either leg, and two\ngrasping him by the head-piece, and darted away with him, carrying his\nbulging metal body between them like a battering ram, while he kicked\nand struggled impotently.\n\n\"They are taking him to the Place of Darkness!\" cried Imee suddenly,\nhaving read my impressions of the scene. \"Oh, go quickly, quickly,\ntoward the direction of your best hand--to your right! I shall\nfollow!\"\n\n\"No! No! Stay back!\" I warned her frantically. All but these six Rorn\nhad fallen victims of Mercer's hellish poison, and while they seemed\nto be suffering no ill effects, I thought it more than likely that\nsome sly current might bring the deadly poison to the girl, did she\ncome this way, and kill her as surely as it had killed these hundreds\nof Rorn.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTo the right, she had said. Towards the Place of Darkness. I hurried\nout of the village in the direction she indicated, towards the distant\ngleam of Mercer's armor, rapidly being lost in the gloom.\n\n\"I'm coming, Mercer!\" I called to him. \"Delay them as much as you can.\nYou're going faster than I can.\"\n\n\"I can't help myself much,\" replied Mercer. \"Doing what I can.\nStrong--they're devilish strong, Taylor. And, at close range, I can\nsee you were right. They have true gill-covers; their noses are\nrudimentary and--\"\n\n\"The devil take your scientific observations! Drag! Slow them down.\nI'm losing sight of you. For heaven's sake, drag!\"\n\n\"I'm doing what I can. Damn you, if I could only get a hand free--\" I\nrealized that this last was directed at his captors, and plunged on.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHuge, monstrous growths swirled around me like living things. My feet\ncrunched on shelled things, and sank into soft and slimy creeping\nthings on the bottom. I cursed the water that held me back so gently\nyet so firmly; I cursed the armor that made it so hard for me to move\nmy legs. But I kept on, and at last I began to gain on them; I could\nsee them quite distinctly, bending over Mercer, working on him....\n\n\"Do your best, Taylor,\" urged Mercer desperately. \"We're on the edge\nof a sort of cliff; a fault in the structure of the ocean bed. They're\ntying me with strong cords of leather. Tying a huge stone to my body.\nI think they--\" I had a momentary flash of the scene as Mercer saw it\nat that instant: the horrid noseless face close to his, the swart\nbodies moving with amazing agility. And at his very feet, a yawning\nprecipice, holding nothing but darkness, leading down and down into\nnothingness.\n\n\"Run quickly!\" It was Imee. She, too, had seen what I had seen. \"That\nis the Place of Darkness, where we take those whom the Five deem\nworthy of the Last Punishment. They will tie the stone to him, and\nbear him out above the Blackness, and then they will let him go!\nQuickly! Quickly!\"\n\nI was almost upon them now, and one of the six turned and saw me.\nThree of them darted towards me, while the others held Mercer flat\nupon the edge of the precipice. If they had only realized that by\nrolling his armored body a foot or two, he would sink ... without the\nstone.... But they did not. Their brains had little reasoning power,\napparently. The attaching of a stone was necessary, in their\nexperience; it was necessary now.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith my left hand I unhooked my light; I already gripped my knife in\nmy right hand. Swinging the light sharply against my leg, I struck the\ntoggle-switch, and a beam of intense brilliancy shot through the\ngloom. It aided me, as I had thought it would; it blinded these\nlarge-eyed denizens of the deep.\n\nSwiftly I struck out with the knife. It hacked harmlessly into the\nshark-skin garment of one of the men, and I stabbed out again. Two of\nthe men leaped for my right arm, but the knife found, this time, the\nthroat of the third. My beam of light showed palely red, for a moment,\nand the body of the Rorn toppled slowly to the bed of the ocean.\n\nThe two shark-faced creatures were hammering at me with their fists,\ndragging at my arms and legs, but I plunged on desperately towards\nMercer. Myriads of fish, all shapes and colors and sizes, attracted by\nthe light, swarmed around us.\n\n\"Good boy!\" Mercer commended. \"See if you can break this last flask of\nacid, here at my waist. See--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith a last desperate plunge, fairly dragging the two Rorn who tugged\nat me, I fell forward. With the clenched steel talons of my right\nhand, I struck at the silvery flask I could see dangling from Mercer's\nwaist. I hit it, but only a glancing blow; the flask did not shatter.\n\n\"Again!\" commanded Mercer. \"It's heavy annealed glass--hydrocyanic\nacid--terrible stuff--even the fumes--\"\n\nI paid but slight heed. The two Rorn dragged me back, but I managed to\ncrawl forward on my knees, and with all my strength, I struck at the\nflask again.\n\nThis time it shattered, and I lay where I fell, sobbing with weakness,\nlooking out through the side window of my head-piece.\n\nThe five Rorn seemed to suddenly lose their strength. They struggled\nlimply for a moment, and then floated down to the waiting sand\nbeneath us.\n\n\"Finish,\" remarked Mercer coolly. \"And just in time. Let's see if we\ncan find our way back to the _Santa Maria_.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe were weary, and we plodded along slowly, twin trails of air-bubbles\nlike plumes waving behind us, rushing upwards to the surface. I felt\nstrangely alone at the moment, isolated, cut off from all mankind, on\nthe bottom of the Atlantic.\n\n\"Coming to meet you, all of us,\" Imee signaled us. \"Be careful where\nyou step, so that you do not walk in a circle and find again the Place\nof Darkness. It is very large.\"\n\n\"Probably some uncharted deep,\" threw in Mercer. \"Only the larger ones\nhave been located.\"\n\nFor my part, I was too weary to think. I just staggered on.\n\nA crowd of slim, darting white shapes surrounded us. They swam before\nus, showing the way. The five patriarchs walked majestically before\nus; and between us, smiling at us through the thick lenses of our\nheadpieces, walked Imee. Oh, it was a triumphal procession, and had I\nbeen less weary, I presume I would have felt quite the hero.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nImee pictured for us, as we went along, the happiness, the\ngratefulness of her people. Already, she informed us, great numbers of\nyoung men were clearing away the bodies of the dead Rorn. She was so\nhappy she could hardly restrain herself.\n\nA dim skeleton shape bulked up at my left. I turned to look at it, and\nImee, watching me through the lights of my head-piece, nodded and\nsmiled.\n\nYes, this was the very hulk by which she had been swimming when the\nshark had attacked her, the shark which had been the cause of the\naccident. She darted on to show me the very rib upon which her head\nhad struck, stunning her so that she had drifted, unconscious and\nstorm-tossed, to the shore of Mercer's estate.\n\nI studied the wreck. It was battered and tilted on its beam ends, but\nI could still make out the high poop that marked it as a very old\nship.\n\n\"A Spanish galleon, Mercer,\" I conjectured.\n\n\"I believe so.\" And then, in pictured form, for Imee's benefit, \"It\nhas been here while much time passed?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Imee came darting back to us, smiling. \"Since before the\nTeemorn, my people were here. A Rorn we made prisoner once told us his\npeople discovered it first. They went into this strange skeleton, and\ninside were many blocks of very bright stone.\" She pictured quite\nclearly bars of dully-glinting bullion. Evidently the captive had told\nhis story well.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"These stones, which were so bright, the Rorn took to their city,\nwhich is three swims distant.\" How far that might be, I could not even\nguess. A swim, it seemed, was the distance a Teemorn could travel\nbefore the need for rest became imperative. \"There were many Rorn, and\nthey each took one stone. And of them, they made a house for their\nleader.\" The leader, as she pictured him, being the most hideous\ntravesty of a thing in semi-human form that the mind could imagine:\nincredibly old and wrinkled and ugly and gray, his noseless face\nseamed with cunning, his eyes red rimmed and terrible, his teeth\ngleaming, white and sharp, like fangs.\n\n\"A whole house, except the roof,\" she went on. \"It is there now, and\nit is gazed at with much admiration by all the Rorn. All this our\nprisoner told us before we took him, with a rock made fast to him, out\nover the Place of Darkness. He, too, was very proud of their leader's\nhouse.\"\n\n\"Treasure!\" I commented to Mercer. \"If we could find the city of the\nRorn, we might make the trip pay for itself!\"\n\nI could sense his wave of amusement.\n\n\"I think,\" he replied, \"I'd rather stand it myself. These Rorn don't\nappeal to me.\"\n\nIt was over half an hour before we were at last free of our diving\nsuits.\n\nThe first thing Captain Bonnett said:\n\n\"We've got to get to the surface, and that quickly. Our air supply is\nrunning damnably low. By the time we blow out the tanks we'll be just\nabout out. And foul air will keep us here until we rot. I'm sorry,\nsir, but that's the way matters stand.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMercer, white-faced and ill, stared at him dazedly.\n\n\"Air?\" he repeated groggily--I knew just how he felt--\"We should have\nlots of air. The specifications--\"\n\n\"But we're dealing with facts, not specifications, sir,\" said Captain\nBonnett. \"Another two hours here and we won't leave ever.\"\n\n\"Then it can't be helped, Captain,\" muttered Mercer. \"We'll go up. And\nback. For more compressed air. We must remember to plot our course\nexactly. You kept the record on the way out as I instructed you?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Captain Bonnett.\n\n\"Just a minute, then,\" said Mercer.\n\nWeakly he made his way forward to the little cubbyhole in which was\nhoused the central station of his thought-telegraph. I didn't even\ninspect the gleaming maze of apparatus. I merely watched him dully as\nhe plugged in an antenna similar to the one we had left with Imee, and\nadjusted the things on his head.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis eyes brightened instantly. \"She's still wearing her antenna,\" he\nsaid swiftly over his shoulder. \"I'll tell her that something's\nhappened; we must leave, but that we will return.\"\n\nHe sat there, frowning intently for a moment, and then dragged the\nantenna wearily from his head. He touched a switch somewhere, and\nseveral softly glowing bulbs turned slowly red and then dark.\n\n\"You and I,\" he groaned, \"had better go to bed. We overdid it. She\nunderstands, I think. Terribly sorry, terribly disappointed. Some\nsort of celebration planned, I gather. Captain Bonnett!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir?\"\n\n\"You may proceed now as you think best,\" said Mercer. \"We're retiring.\nBe sure and chart the course back, so we may locate this spot again.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\" said Captain Bonnett.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen I awoke we were at anchor, our deck barely awash, before the\ndeserted beach of Mercer's estate. Still feeling none too well, Mercer\nand I made our way to the narrow deck.\n\nCaptain Bonnett was waiting for us, spruce in his blue uniform, his\nshoulders bowed as always.\n\n\"Good morning, gentlemen,\" he offered, smiling crisply. \"The open air\nseems good, doesn't it?\"\n\nIt did. There was a fresh breeze blowing in from the Atlantic, and I\nfilled my lungs gratefully. I had not realized until that instant just\nhow foul the air below had been.\n\n\"Very fine, Captain,\" said Mercer, nodding. \"You have signaled the men\non shore to send out a boat to take us off?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; I believe they're launching her now.\"\n\n\"And the chart of our course--did the return trip check with the\nother?\"\n\n\"Perfectly, sir.\" Captain Bonnett reached in an inner pocket of his\ndouble-breasted coat, extracted two folded pages, and extended them,\nwith a little bow, to Mercer.\n\nJust as Mercer's eager fingers touched the precious papers, however,\nthe wind whisked them from Bonnett's grasp and whirled them into the\nwater.\n\nBonnett gasped and gazed after them for a split second; then, barely\npausing to tear off his coat, he plunged over the side.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe tried desperately, but before he could reach either one of the\ntossing white specks, they were washed beneath the surface and\ndisappeared. Ten minutes later, his uniform bedraggled and shapeless,\nhe pulled himself on deck.\n\n\"I'm sorry, sir,\" he gasped, out of breath. \"Sorrier than I can say. I\ntried--\"\n\nMercer, white-faced and struggling with his emotions, looked down and\nturned away.\n\n\"You don't remember the bearings, I suppose?\" he ventured tonelessly.\n\n\"I'm sorry--no.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Captain, for trying so hard to recover the papers,\" said\nMercer. \"You'd better change at once; the wind is sharp.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe captain bowed and disappeared down the conning tower. Then Mercer\nturned to me, and a smile struggled for life.\n\n\"Well, Taylor, we helped her out, anyway,\" he said slowly. \"I'm sorry\nthat--that Imee will misunderstand when we don't come back.\"\n\n\"But, Mercer,\" I said swiftly, \"perhaps we'll be able to find our way\nback to her. You thought before, you know, that--\"\n\n\"But I can see now what an utterly wild-goose chase it would have\nbeen.\" Mercer shook his head slowly. \"No, old friend, it would be\nimpossible. And--Imee will not come again to guide us; she will think\nwe have deserted her. And\"--he smiled slowly up into my eyes--\"perhaps\nit is as well. After all, the photographs and the data I wanted would\ndo the world no practical good. We did Imee and her people a good\nturn; let's content ourselves with that. I, for one, am satisfied.\"\n\n\"And I, old timer,\" I said, placing my hand affectionately upon his\nshoulder. \"Here's the boat. Shall we go ashore?\"\n\nWe did go ashore, silently. And as we got out of the boat, and set\nfoot again upon the sand, we both turned and looked out across the\nsmiling Atlantic, dancing brightly in the sun.\n\nThe mighty, mysterious Atlantic--home of Imee and her people!\n\n\n\n\nMurder Madness\n\nBEGINNING A FOUR-PART NOVEL\n\n_By Murray Leinster_\n\n[Illustration: _The heads leveled the revolver in spite of him, while\nhe flung his head from side to side in a frantic attempt to disturb\ntheir aim._]\n\n[Sidenote: Murder Madness! Seven Secret Service men had completely\ndisappeared. Another had been found a screaming, homicidal maniac,\nwhose fingers writhed like snakes. So Bell, of the secret \"Trade,\"\nplunges into South America after The Master--the mighty, unknown\noctopus of power whose diabolical poison threatens a continent!]\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nThe engines of the _Almirante Gomez_ were going dead slow. Away up\nbeside her monster funnels her siren blew dismally, _Whoo-oo-oo-oo!_\nand was silent for the regulation period, and blew desolately again\ninto the clinging gray mist that ringed her all about.\n\nHer decks were wet and glistening. Droplets of water stood upon the\ndeck-stanchions, and dripped from the outer edge of the roof above the\npromenade deck. A thin, swirling fog lay soggily upon the water and\nthe big steamer went dead slow upon her course, sending dismal and\ndepressing blasts from her horn from time to time. It was barely\npossible to see from one side of the ship to the other. It was surely\nimpossible to see the bow from a point half astern.\n\nCharley Bell went forward along the promenade deck. He passed Senor\nOrtiz, ex-Minister of the Interior of the Argentine Republic. Ortiz\nbowed to him punctiliously, but Bell had a sudden impression that the\nArgentine's face was gray and ghastly. He checked himself and looked\nback. The little man was climbing the companion-ladder toward the\nwireless room.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBell slipped on toward the bow. He did not want to give an impression\nof furtiveness, but the _Almirante Gomez_ was twelve days out of New\nYork and Bell was still entirely ignorant of why he was on board. He\nhad been called into the office of his chief in the State Department\nand told curtly that his request for leave of absence had been\ngranted. And Bell had not asked for a leave of absence. But at just\nthat moment he saw a rubber band on the desk of his immediate\nsuperior, a fairly thick rubber band which had been tied into a\ncertain intricate knot. And Bell had kept quiet. He went to his\napartment, found his bags packed and tickets to Rio via the _Almirante\nGomez_ in an envelope on his dressing-table, and went out and caught a\ntrain to the ship.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAnd that was all he knew. The siren up above blared dolefully into the\nfog. It was damp, and soggy, and depressing. The other passengers were\nunder cover, and the decks seemed to be deserted. From the saloon came\nthe sound of music. Bell pulled the collar of his light topcoat about\nhis throat and strolled on toward the bow.\n\nHe faced a row of steamer chairs. There was a figure curled up in one\nof them. Paula Canalejas, muffled up against the dampness and staring\nsomberly out into the mist. Bell had met her in Washington and liked\nher a great deal, but he swore softly at sight of her in his way.\n\nThe afternoon before, he had seen a stoker on the _Almirante Gomez_\npick up a bit of rope and absently tie knots in it while he exchanged\nRabelasian humor with his fellows. He had not looked at Bell at all,\nbut the knots he tied were the same that Bell had last seen tied in a\nrubber band on a desk in the State Department in Washington. And Bell\nknew a recognition signal when he saw one. The stoker would be off\nwatch, just now, and by all the rules of reason he ought to be out\nthere on the forecastle, waiting for Bell to turn up and receive\ninstructions.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut Bell paused, lit a cigarette carefully, and strolled forward.\n\n\"Mr. Bell.\"\n\nHe stopped and beamed fatuously at her. It would have been logical for\nhim to fall in love with her, and it is always desirable to seem\nlogical. He had striven painstakingly to give the impression that he\nhad fallen in love with her--and then had striven even more\npainstakingly to keep from doing it.\n\n\"Hullo,\" he said in bland surprise. \"What are you doing out on deck?\"\n\nBrown eyes regarded him speculatively.\n\n\"Thinking,\" she said succinctly. \"About you, Mr. Bell.\"\n\nBell beamed.\n\n\"Thinking,\" he confided, \"is usually a bad habit, especially in a\ngirl. But if you must think, I approve of your choice of subjects.\nWhat were you thinking about me?\"\n\nThe brown eyes regarded him still more speculatively.\n\n\"I was wondering--\" said Paula, glancing to either side, \"I was\nwondering if you happen to be--er--a member of the United States\nSecret Service.\"\n\nBell laughed with entire naturalness.\n\n\"Good Lord, no!\" he said amusedly. \"I have a desk in the State\nDepartment building, and I read consular reports all day long and\nwrite letters bedeviling the consuls for not including unavailable\nstatistics in their communications. That's my work. I'm on leave now.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe looked skeptical and, it may be, disappointed.\n\n\"You look as if you didn't believe me,\" said Bell, smiling. \"I give\nyou my word of honor I'm not a member of the United States Secret\nService. Will that do to relieve your suspicions?\"\n\n\"I believe you,\" she said slowly, \"but it does not relieve my mind. I\nshall think about other people. I have something important to tell a\nmember of the United States Secret Service.\"\n\nBell shrugged.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" he said amiably, \"that I can't oblige you by tipping one\nof them off. That's what you wanted me to do, isn't it?\"\n\nShe nodded, and the gesture was very much like a dismissal. Bell\nfrowned, hesitated, and went on. He was anxious to meet the stoker,\nbut this....\n\nThe siren droned dismally over his head. Fog lay deep about the ship.\nThe washing of the waves and dripping of water on the decks was\ndepressing. It seemed to be getting thicker. Four stanchions ahead,\nthe mist was noticeable. He found that he could count five, six,\nseven.... The eighth was indefinite. But a bar materialized in the fog\nbefore him, and the grayness drew away before him and closed in\nbehind. When he was at the forward end of the promenade, looking down\nupon the forecastle deck, he was isolated. He heard footsteps some\ndistance overhead. The watch officer up on the bridge. Bell glanced up\nand saw him as an indistinct figure. He waited until the officer paced\nover to the opposite side of the bridge. The air throbbed and shook\nwith the roaring of the siren.\n\nBell slipped over the edge of the rail and swung swiftly down the\nlittle ladder of iron bars set into the ship's structure. In seconds\nhe had landed, and was down upon that terra incognita of all\npassengers, the deck reserved for the use of the crew.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA mast loomed overhead, with its heavy, clumsy derrick-booms. A winch\nwas by his side. Oddments of deck machinery, inexplicable to a\nlandsman, formed themselves vaguely in the mist. The fog was thicker,\nnaturally, since the deck was closer to the water's edge.\n\n\"Hey!\" growled a voice close beside him. \"Passengers ain't allowed\ndown here.\"\n\nAn unshaven, soot-smeared figure loomed up. Bell could not see the man\nsave as a blur in the mist, but he said cheerfully:\n\n\"I know it, but I wanted to look. Seafaring's a trade I'd like to know\nsomething about.\"\n\nThe figure grunted. Bell had just given his word of honor that he\nwasn't a member of the Secret Service. He wasn't. But he was in the\nTrade--which has no official existence anywhere. And the use of the\nword in his first remark was a recognition signal.\n\n\"What is your trade, anyways?\" growled the figure skeptically.\n\n\"I sharpen serpents' teeth from time to time,\" offered Bell amiably.\nHe recognized the man, suddenly. \"Hullo, Jamison, you look like the\ndevil.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJamison drew nearer. He grunted softly.\n\n\"I know it. Listen closely, Bell. Your job is getting some information\nfrom Canalejas, Minister of War in Rio. He sent word up to Washington\nthat he'd something important to say. It isn't treachery to Brazil,\nbecause he's a decent man. Seven Secret Service men have disappeared\nin South America within three months. They've found the eighth, and\nhe's crazy. Something has driven him mad, and they say it's a devilish\npoison. He's a homicidal maniac, returning to the United States in a\nstraight-jacket. Canalejas knows what's happened to the Service men.\nHe said so, and he's going to tell us. His daughter brought the news\nto Washington, and then instead of going on to Europe as she was\nsupposed to do, she started back to Rio. You're to get this formation\nand pass it on to me, then try to keep your skin whole and act\ninnocent. You were picked out because, as a State Department man, hell\ncould be raised if you vanished. Understand?\"\n\nBell nodded.\n\n\"Something horrible is going on. Secret Service can't do anything. The\nman in Asunci\u00f3n isn't dead--he's been seen--but he's cut loose. And\nService men don't often do that. He don't report. That means the\nService code may have been turned over, and hell to pay generally.\nIt's up to the Trade.\"\n\n\"I've got it,\" said Bell. \"Here are two items for you. Miss Canalejas\njust said she suspected I was Secret Service. I convinced her I\nwasn't. She says she has important information for a Service man.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe brawny figure of the stoker growled.\n\n\"Damn women! She was told somebody'd be sent to see her father. She\nwas shown a recognition-knot with the outsider's variation. Given one,\nfor father. That'll identify you to him. But she shouldn't have\ntalked. Now, be careful. As nearly as we know, that chap in the\nstraight-jacket was given some poison that drove him insane. There are\nhellish drugs down there. Maybe the same thing happened to others.\nLook out for yourself, and give me the information Canalejas gives you\nas quickly as God will let you. If anything happens to you, we want\nthe stuff to get back. Understand?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Bell. He carefully did not shiver as he realized\nwhat Jamison meant by anything happening to him. \"The other item is\nthat Ortiz, ex-Minister of the Interior of the Argentine, is scared to\ndeath about something. Sending radios right and left.\"\n\n\"Umph,\" growled Jamison. \"One of our men vanished in Buenos Aires.\nWatch him. You're friendly?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Get friendlier. See what he's got. Now shoo.\"\n\nBell swung up the ladder again. Mist opened before him and closed\nagain behind. He climbed over the rail to the promenade deck, and felt\na little flare of irritation. There was a figure watching him.\n\nHe slipped to the deck and grinned sheepishly at Paula Canalejas. She\nstood with her hands in the pockets of her little sport coat,\nregarding him very gravely.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I suppose,\" said Charley Bell sheepishly, \"that I look like a fool.\nBut I've always wanted to climb up and down that ladder. I suppose\nit's a survival from the age of childhood. At the age of seven I\nlonged to be a fireman.\"\n\n\"I wonder,\" said Paula quietly. \"Mr. Bell\"--she stepped close to\nhim--\"I am taking a desperate chance. For the sake of my father, I\nwish certain things known. I think that you are an honorable man, and\nI think that you lied to me just now. Go and see Senor Ortiz. Your\ngovernment will want to know what happens to him. Go and see him\nquickly.\"\n\nBell felt the same flare of irritation as before. Women do not follow\nrules. They will not follow rules. They depend upon intuition, which\nis sometimes right, but sometimes leads to ungodly errors. Paula was\nright this time, but she could have been wholly and hopelessly wrong.\nIf she had talked to anyone else....\n\n\"My child,\" said Bell paternally--he was at least two years older than\nPaula--\"you should be careful. I did not lie to you just now. I am not\nSecret Service. But I happen to know that you have a tiny piece of\nstring to give your father, and I beg of you not to show that to\nanyone else. And--well--you are probably watched. You must not talk\nseriously to me!\"\n\nHe lifted his hat and started astern. He was more than merely\nirritated. He was almost frightened. Because the Trade, officially,\ndoes not exist at all, and everybody in the Trade is working entirely\non his own; and because those people who suspect that there is a Trade\nand dislike it are not on their own, but have plenty of resources\nbehind them. And yet it is requisite that the Trade shall succeed in\nits various missions. Always.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Government of the United States, you understand, will admit that\nit has a Secret Service, which it strives to identify solely with the\npursuit of counterfeiters, postal thieves, and violators of the\nprohibition laws. Strongly pressed, it will admit that some members of\nthe Secret Service work abroad, the official explanation being that\nthey work abroad to forestall smugglers. And at a pinch, and in\nconfidence, it may concede the existence of diplomatic secret agents.\nBut there is no such thing as the Trade. Not at all. The funds which\nmembers of the Trade expend are derived by very devious bookkeeping\nfrom the appropriations allotted to an otherwise honestly conducted\nDepartment of the United States Government.\n\nTherefore the Trade does not really exist. You might say that there is\na sort of conspiracy among certain people to do certain things. Some\nof them are government officials, major and minor. Some of them are\nprivate citizens, reputable and otherwise. One or two of them are in\njail, both here and abroad. But as far as the Government of the United\nStates is concerned, certain fortunate coincidences that happen now\nand then are purely coincidences. And the Trade, which arranges for\nthem, does not exist. But it has a good many enemies.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe fog-horn howled dismally overhead. Mist swirled past the ship, and\nan oily swell surged vaguely overside and disappeared into a gray\noblivion half a ship's length away. Bell moved on toward the stern. It\nwas his intention to go into the smoking-room and idle ostentatiously.\nPerhaps he would enter into another argument with that Brazilian air\npilot who had so much confidence in Handley-Page wing-slots. Bell had,\nin Washington, a small private plane that, he explained, had been\ngiven him by a wealthy aunt, who hoped he would break his neck in it.\nHe considered that wing-slots interfered with stunting.\n\nHe had picked out the door with his eye when he espied a small figure\nstanding by the rail. It was Ortiz, the Argentine ex-Cabinet Minister,\nstaring off into the grayness, and seeming to listen with all his\nears.\n\nBell slowed up. The little stout man turned and nodded to him, and\nthen put out his hand.\n\n\"Senor Bell,\" he said quietly, \"tell me. Do you hear airplane motors?\"\n\nBell listened. The drip-drip-drip of condensed mist. The shuddering of\nthe ship with her motors going dead slow. The tinkling, muted notes of\nthe piano inside the saloon. The washing and hissing of the waves\noverside. That was all.\n\n\"Why, no,\" said Bell. \"I don't. Sound travels freakishly in fog,\nthough. One might be quite close and we couldn't hear it. But we're a\nhundred and fifty miles off the Venezuelan coast, aren't we?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOrtiz turned and faced him. Bell was shocked at the expression on the\nsmall man's face. It was drained of all blood, and its look was\nghastly. But the rather fine dark eyes were steady.\n\n\"We are,\" agreed Ortiz, very steadily indeed, \"but I--I have received\na radiogram that some airplane should fly near this ship, and it would\namuse me to hear it.\"\n\nBell frowned at the fog.\n\n\"I've done a good bit of flying,\" he observed, \"and if I were flying\nout at sea right now, I'd dodge this fog bank. It would be\npractically suicide to try to alight in a mist like this.\"\n\nOrtiz regarded him carefully. It seemed to Bell that sweat was coming\nout upon the other man's forehead.\n\n\"You mean,\" he said quietly, \"that an airplane could not land?\"\n\n\"It might try,\" said Bell with a shrug. \"But you couldn't judge your\nheight above the water. You might crash right into it and dive under.\nMatter of fact, you probably would.\"\n\nOrtiz's nostrils quivered a little.\n\n\"I told them,\" he said steadily, \"I told them it was not wise to\nrisk....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe stopped. He looked suddenly at his hands, clenched upon the rail. A\ndepth of pallor even greater than his previous terrible paleness\nseemed to leave even his lips without blood. He wavered on his feet,\nas if he were staggering.\n\n\"You're sick!\" said Bell sharply. Instinctively he moved forward.\n\nThe fine dark eyes regarded him oddly. And Ortiz suddenly took his\nhands from the railing of the promenade deck. He looked at his fingers\ndetachedly. And Bell could see them writhing, opening and closing in a\nhorribly sensate fashion, as if they were possessed of devils and\naltogether beyond the control of their owner. And he suddenly realized\nthat the steady, grim regard with which Ortiz looked at his hands was\nexactly like the look he had seen upon a man's face once, when that\nman saw a venomous snake crawling toward him and had absolutely no\nweapon.\n\nOrtiz was looking at his fingers as a man might look at cobras at the\nends of his wrists. Very calmly, but with a still, stunned horror.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe lifted his eyes to Bell.\n\n\"I have no control over them,\" he said quietly. \"My hands are useless\nto me, Senor Bell. I wonder if you will be good enough to assist me to\nmy cabin.\"\n\nAgain that deadly pallor flashed across his face. Bell caught at his\narm.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" he demanded anxiously. \"Of course I'll help\nyou.\"\n\nOrtiz smiled very faintly.\n\n\"If any airplane arrives in time,\" he said steadily, \"something may be\ndone. But you have rid me of even that hope. I have been poisoned,\nSenor Bell.\"\n\n\"But the ship's doctor....\"\n\nOrtiz, walking rather stiffly beside Bell, shrugged.\n\n\"He can do nothing. Will you be good enough to open this door for me?\nAnd\"--his voice was hoarse for an instant--\"assist me to put my hands\nin my pockets. I cannot. But I would not like them to be seen.\"\n\nBill took hold of the writhing fingers. He saw sweat standing out upon\nOrtiz's forehead. And the fingers closed savagely upon Bell's hands,\ntearing at them. Ortiz looked at him with a ghastly supplication.\n\n\"Now,\" he said with difficulty, \"if you will open the door, Senor\nBell....\"\n\nBell slid the door aside. They went in together. People were making\nthe best of boresome weather within, frankly yawning, most of them.\nBut the card-room would be full, and the smoking-room steward would be\nbusy.\n\n\"My cabin is upon the next deck below,\" said Ortiz through stiff lips.\n\"We--we will descend the stairs.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBell went with him, his face expressionless.\n\n\"My cabin should be unlocked,\" said Ortiz.\n\nIt was. Ortiz entered, and, with his hands still in his pockets,\nindicated a steamer-trunk.\n\n\"Please open that.\" He licked his lips. \"I--I had thought I would have\nwarning enough. It has not been so severe before. Right at the\ntop....\"\n\nBell flung the top back. A pair of bright and shiny handcuffs lay on\ntop of a dress shirt.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Ortiz steadily. \"Put them upon my wrists, please. The\npoison that has been given to me is--peculiar. I believe that one of\nyour compatriots has experienced its effects.\"\n\nBell started slightly. Ortiz eyed him steadily.\n\n\"Precisely.\" Ortiz, with his face a gray mask of horror, spoke with a\nsteadiness Bell could never have accomplished. \"A poison, Senor Bell,\nwhich has made a member of the Secret Service of the United States a\nhomicidal maniac. It has been given to me. I have been hoping for its\nantidote, but--Quick! Senor Bell! Quick! The handcuffs!\"\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nThe throbbing of the engines went on at an unvarying tempo. There was\nthe slight, almost infinitesimal tremor of their vibration. The\nelectric light in the cabin wavered rhythmically with its dynamo. From\nthe open porthole came the sound of washing water. Now and then a\ndisconnected sound of laughter or of speech came down from the main\nsaloon.\n\nOrtiz lay upon the bed, exhausted.\n\n\"It is perhaps humorous, Senor Bell,\" he said presently, in the same\nsteady voice he had used upon the deck. \"It is undoubtedly humorous\nthat I should call upon you. I believe that you are allied with the\nSecret Service of your government.\"\n\nBell started to shake his head, but was still. He said nothing.\n\n\"I am poisoned,\" said Ortiz. He tried to smile, but it was ghastly.\n\"It is a poison which makes a man mad in a very horrible fashion. If I\ncould use my hands--and could trust them--I would undoubtedly shoot\nmyself. It would be entirely preferable. Instead, I hope--\"\n\nHe broke off short and listened intently. His forehead beaded.\n\n\"Is that an airplane motor?\"\n\nBell went to the port and listened. The washing of waves. The\nthrobbing of the ship's engines. The dismal, long-drawn-out moaning\nof the fog-horn. Nothing else.... Yes! A dim and distant muttering. It\ndrew nearer and died away again.\n\n\"That is a plane,\" said Bell. \"Yes, It's out of hearing now.\"\n\nOrtiz clamped his jaws together.\n\n\"I was about to speak,\" he said steadily, \"to tell you--many things.\nWhich your government should know. Instead, I ask you to go to the\nwireless room and have the wireless operator try to get in touch with\nthat plane. It is a two-motored seaplane and it has a wireless outfit.\nIt will answer the call M.S.T.R. Ask him to use his directional\nwireless and try to guide it to the ship. It brings the antidote to\nthe poison which affects me.\"\n\nBell made for the door. Ortiz raised his head with a ghastly smile.\n\n\"Close the door tightly,\" he said quietly. \"I--I feel as if I shall be\nunpleasant.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nClosing the door behind him, Bell felt rather like a man in a\nnightmare. He made for the stairway, bolted for the deck, and fairly\ndarted up the ladder to the wireless room.\n\n\"Ortiz sent me,\" he said to the operator. \"You heard that plane just\nnow. See if you can get it.\"\n\nThe operator looked up at him beneath a green eyeshade and grinned\ncrookedly.\n\n\"Talking to 'em now,\" he said.\n\nThe key flicked up and down, and a tiny dancing spark leaped into\nbeing and vanished beneath its contact-point. The wireless room was\ndark save for the bright, shaded light above the sending table. A file\nof sent messages by an elbow. A pad for messages received was by a\nhand. Stray wreaths of tobacco smoke floated about the room, leaping\ninto view as they drifted beneath the lamp.\n\n\"Is he bad?\" asked the operator fascinatedly, his eyes fixed on his\nkey.\n\nBell felt his eyelids flicker.\n\n\"Very bad,\" he said shortly.\n\n\"They tell me,\" said the operator and shuddered, \"your hands get\nworking and you can't stop 'em.... I'm playing, I am! I'm playing The\nMaster's game!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe key stopped. He listened.\n\n\"They're going to try to swoop over the ship and drop it,\" he said a\nmoment later. \"I don't think they can. But tell Ortiz they're going to\ntry.\"\n\nBell's eyes were narrow. It is not customary for a radio operator on a\npassenger ship to speak of an ex-Cabinet Minister of the Argentine\nRepublic by his surname only. It bespeaks either impertinence or a\ncertain very peculiar association. Bell frowned imperceptibly for an\ninstant, thinking.\n\n\"You've--had it?\" he asked sharply.\n\n\"God, no! I never took the chance! I saw the red spots once, and I\nwent to Rib--Say! You got a password?\"\n\nHe was staring up at Bell. Bell shrugged.\n\n\"I'm trying to help Senor Ortiz now.\"\n\nThe operator continued to stare, his eyes full of suspicion. Then he\ngrimaced.\n\n\"All right. Go tell him they're going to drop it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBell went out. Gray fog, and washing seas, and the big ship ploughing\nsteadily on toward the south.... The horn blared, startlingly loud and\nunspeakably doleful. Bell listened for other sounds. There were none.\n\nDown the steep ladder to the promenade deck. Paula Canalejas nodded to\nhim.\n\n\"I saw you speak to Senor Ortiz,\" she said quietly. \"You see?\"\n\nBell was beginning to have a peculiar, horrible suspicion. It was\nincredible, but it was inevitable.\n\n\"I think I see,\" he said harshly. \"But I don't dare believe it. Keep\nquiet and don't speak to me unless I give you some sign it's safe!\nIt's--hellish!\"\n\nHe went inside and swiftly down the stairs. He found a steward\nhesitating outside the door of Ortiz's cabin. He touched Bell's arm\nanxiously as he was about to go in.\n\n\"Beg pardon, sir,\" he said, and stammered. \"I--I heard Mr. Ortiz\nmaking some--very strange noises, sir. I--I thought he was sick....\"\n\n\"He is,\" said Bell grimly. \"He told me he does not want a doctor,\nthough. I'm looking after him.\"\n\nHe closed the door behind him, and Ortiz grinned at him. It was a\nhorrible, a terrible grin, and Ortiz fought it from his face with a\nterrific effort of will. There was foam about his lips.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"_Dios!_ It was--it was devilish!\" he gasped. \"Senor Bell, _amigo\nmio_, for the love of the good God get my revolver from my trunk. Give\nit to me....\"\n\nBell said shortly: \"The airplane just radioed that it's going to try\nto swoop overhead and drop a package on board the steamer. It doesn't\ndare alight in this fog.\"\n\n\"I think,\" gasped Ortiz, \"I think it would be well to tie my feet. Tie\nthem fast! If--if the package comes, if I--if I am unpleasant, knock\nme unconscious and pour it into my mouth. I fear it is too late now.\nBut try it....\"\n\nThrough the port came the muttering of a seaplane's engines. The noise\ndied away. Almost instantly the siren boomed hoarsely.\n\n\"Ah, _Dios!_\" said Ortiz unsteadily. \"There it is! Senor Bell, I think\nit is too late. Would you--would you assist me to go out on deck,\nwhere I might fling myself overboard? I--think I can control my legs\nso long.\"\n\n\"Steady!\" said Bell, wrenched by the sight of the man before him\nfighting against unnameable horror. \"Tell me--\"\n\n\"It is poison,\" said Ortiz, his features fixed in a terrible effort of\nwill. \"A ghastly, a horrible poison of the _Indios_ of Matto Grosso,\nin Brazil. It drives a man mad, murder mad. It is as if he were\npossessed by a devil. His hands first refuse to obey him. His feet\nnext. And then his body. It is as if a devil had seized hold of his\nbody and carried it about doing murder with it. A part of the brain is\ndriven insane, and a man goes about shrieking with the horror of what\ncrimes his body commits until the poison reaches that portion of his\nbrain as well. Then he is mad forever. That is what I face, _amigo\nmio_. That is why I beg you, I implore you, to kill me or assist me to\nthe side of the ship so that I may fling myself overboard! The Master\nhad it administered to me secretly, and demanded treason as the price\nof the antidote. He deman--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSteady and strong, rising from a muttering to a steady roar, the sound\nof airplane motors came through the port. Bell started up.\n\n\"Hold fast,\" he snapped savagely. \"I'll go get that package when it\nlands. Hold fast, I tell you! Fight it!\"\n\nHe flung out of the cabin and raced up the stairs. The door to the\ndeck was open. He crowded through a group of passengers who had\ndiscounted the dampness for the sake of a novelty--an airplane far out\nat sea--and raced up to the upper deck. The roaring noise was\nreceding. The siren roared hoarsely. Then the noise came back.\n\nFor minutes, then, the ship seemed to play hide-and-seek with the\ninvisible fliers. The roaring noise overhead circled about, now near,\nnow seeming very far away. And the siren sent its dismal blasts out\ninto the grayness all about. Then, for an instant, a swiftly scudding\nshadow was visible overhead. It banked steeply and vanished, and\nseemed to have turned and come lower when it reappeared a moment\nlater. It was not distinct, at first. It was merely a silhouette of\ndarker gray against the all-enveloping mist. But its edges sharpened\nand became clear. One could make out struts, an aileron's trailing\nedge.\n\n\"Got nerve, anyhow,\" said Bell grimly.\n\nIt swept across the ship and disappeared, but the noise of its engines\ndid not dwindle more than a little. The blast of the siren seemed to\nsummon it back again. Once more it came in sight, and this time it\ndived steeply, flashed across the forecastle deck amid a hideous\nuproar, desperately, horribly close to the dangling derrick-cables,\nand was gone.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBell had seen it more clearly than anyone else on the ship, perhaps.\nHe saw a man in the pilot's cockpit between wings and tail reach high\nand fling something downward, something with a long streamer attached\nto it. Bell had an instant's glimpse of the goggled face. Then he was\ndarting forward, watching the thing that fell.\n\nIt took only a second. Two at most. But the thing seemed to fall with\ninfinite deliberation, the streamer shivering out behind it. It fell\nat a steep slant, the forward momentum of the plane's speed added to\nits own drop. It swooped down, slanting toward the rail....\n\nBell groaned. It struck the rail itself, and bounced. A sailor flung\nhimself toward it. The streamer slipped from his fingers and slithered\nover the side.\n\nBell was at the railing just in time to see it drop into the water. He\nopened his mouth to shout, and saw it sink. The last of the streamer\nfollowed the dropped object down into the green water when it was\ndirectly below him.\n\nHis hands clenched. Bell stared sickly at the spot where it had\nvanished. An instant later he had whirled and was thrusting wide the\nwireless room door. The operator was returning to his key, grinning\ncrookedly. He looked up sidewise.\n\n\"Tell them it went overside,\" snapped Bell. \"Tell them to try it\nagain. Ortiz is in hell! To try again! He's dying!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe operator looked up fascinatedly, his fingers working his key.\n\n\"Is he--bad?\" he asked with a shuddering interest.\n\n\"He's dying!\" snarled Bell, in a rage because of his helplessness. He\nhad forgotten everything but the fact that a man below decks was\nfacing the most horrible fate that can overtake a man, and facing it\nwith a steadfast gameness that made Bell's heart go out to him.\n\n\"They don't die,\" said the operator. He shuddered. \"They don't die of\nit.\"\n\nHis key stopped. He listened. His key clicked again.\n\n\"They only had two packages,\" he said a moment later. \"They don't dare\nrisk the other one. They say the fog ends twenty miles farther on.\nThey're going to land up there and taxi back on the surface of the\nwater. It shouldn't be more than half an hour.\"\n\nHe pushed himself back from the table with an air of finality.\n\n\"That's all. They've signed off.\"\n\nBell felt rage sweeping over him. The operator grinned crookedly.\n\n\"Better go down and tie him up,\" he said, and licked his lips with the\nfascinated air of one thinking of a known and terrifying thing.\n\"Better tie him up tight. It'll be half an hour more.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBell went down the companion-ladder. The promenade was crowded with\npassengers now, asking questions of each other. Some, frowning\nportentously, thought the plane an unscheduled ocean flier who had\nlost his way in the fog.\n\nPaula Canalejas was close to Bell as he shouldered his way through the\ncrowd.\n\n\"That was for him?\" she asked, without moving her lips.\n\nBell nodded.\n\n\"Tell him,\" she said quietly, \"I--pray for him.\"\n\nBell nodded abruptly and went into the saloon. It was nearly empty. He\nwiped the sweat off his face. It was horrible to have to go down to\nOrtiz and tell him that at best it would be half an hour more....\n\nThen there was a sudden scream below him, and then a shot. Bell jumped\nfor the stairs, his heart in his throat, and saw Ortiz coming out of\nhis stateroom door. His eyes were wide and agonized. His body....\n\nEven in the incredibly short time before he reached the bottom of the\nsteps, Bell had time to receive the ghastly impression that Ortiz was\nsane, but that his body had gone mad. Ortiz's face was white and\nhorrified. His hands and arms were writhing savagely, working at the\nhandcuffs on his wrists. His legs were carrying him at a curious,\npadding trot down the hallway. One of the hands held a glittering\nrevolver. A steward was crouched behind a couch, his face white and\nfilled with stark terror. And Ortiz held his head back, as if\nstruggling to hold back and control his body, which was under the\ncontrol of a malignant demon.\n\n\"Out of the way!\" cried Ortiz in a voice of terrible despair. \"Get\nsomeone to shoot me! Kill me! I cannot--ah, _Dios!_\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe hands leveled the revolver in spite of him, while he flung his\nhead from side to side in a frantic attempt to disturb their aim.\n\n\"Close your eyes!\" panted Bell, and hurled himself upon--whom? It was\nnot Ortiz. It was Ortiz's body, gone mad and raging. The manacled arms\nflailed about frenziedly. The gun went off. Again. Again....\n\nBell struck. He knocked the Thing that possessed Ortiz's body off its\nfeet. The hands groped for him. They clubbed at him with the revolver.\nThe feet kicked....\n\n\"Keep your eyes closed,\" gasped Bell, struggling to get the gun away\nfrom those horrible hands. \"It--it can't see when you keep your eyes\nclosed!\"\n\nFighting insanely as the Thing was fighting, he could not identify it\nwith Ortiz himself. One of the hands unclosed from about the revolver\nand clawed at his throat. It seemed to abandon that effort and\nattacked Ortiz's face in a frenzy of rage, struggling to claw his eyes\nopen. The other held the weapon fast with maniacal strength.\n\nAt the horror of feeling one of his own manacled hands attacking his\nface savagely as if it were itself a sensate thing, Ortiz opened his\neyes. They were wide with despair.\n\nThe hand with the revolver made a sudden movement, and Bell flung his\nweight upon it as the clutching hand pulled the trigger. There was a\ndeafening report....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe body seemed to weaken suddenly in Bell's grip. It fought less and\nless terribly, though with no lessening of its savagery. He managed to\nget the revolver away from the hands that shook with unspeakable rage.\nHe flung it away and stood panting.\n\nThere was a crowd of people suddenly all about the place. Staring,\nstunned, incredulous people who regarded Bell with a dawning, damning\nsuspicion.\n\nOrtiz spoke suddenly. His voice was weak, but it was steady, and it\nwas full of a desperate relief.\n\n\"I wish to make a statement,\" he said sharply. \"I--I wished to commit\nsuicide for personal reasons. Senor Bell tried to dissuade me. The\nhandcuffs upon my wrists were placed there with my consent. Senor Bell\nis my friend and has done me no wrong. I shot myself, with intention.\"\n\nBell beckoned to the ship's doctor.\n\n\"Get him bandaged up,\" he ordered harshly. \"There's no need for him to\ndie.\"\n\nThe body was writhing only feebly, now. Ortiz looked up at him, and\nmanaged a smile. Again there was that incredible impression of the\nbody not belonging to Ortiz, or Ortiz as a sane and whole and\nhonorable, admirable man, and the feebly writhing body with its\nclutching hands as some evil thing that had properly been defeated and\nkilled.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe doctor bent down. It was useless, of course. He made futile\nmovements.\n\n\"I wish to speak to my friend, Senor Bell,\" said Ortiz weakly. \"I--I\nhave not long.\"\n\nBell knelt beside him.\n\n\"The Master's--deputy in Rio,\" panted Ortiz weakly, almost in a\nwhisper, \"is--is Ribiera. In Buenos Aires I--I do not know. There was\na man--the one who poisoned me--but I killed him. Secretly. I do not\nthink--the Master knows. I pray that--\"\n\nHe stopped. He could not speak again. But he smiled, and a few seconds\nlater Bell clenched his hands. Ortiz was gone.\n\nSomeone touched his arm. Paula Canalejas. He stared down at her and\nmanaged to smile. It was not a very successful smile. He drew a deep\nbreath.\n\n\"I would like,\" said Bell wryly, \"to think that, when I die, I will\ndie as well as this man did. But I'm afraid I shan't.\"\n\nBut Paula said:\n\n\"The airplane can be heard outside. It seems to be moving on the\nsurface.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd ten minutes later the plane loomed up out of the mist, queerly\nungainly on the surface of the water. Its motors roared impatiently as\nif held in leash. It swung clumsily about, heading off out of sight in\nthe fog to turn. It came back, sliding along the top of the water with\nits wing-tip floats leaving alternate streaks of white foam behind\nthem. A man stood up in its after cockpit.\n\nBell crowded to the rail. The man--goggled and masked--held up a\npackage as if to fling it on board. Bell watched grimly. But he saw\nthat the pilot checked himself and looked up at the upper deck. Bell\ncraned his neck. The wireless operator was waving wildly to the\nseaplane. He writhed his hands, and held his hand to his head is if\nblowing out his brains, and waved the plane away, frantically.\n\nThe pilot of the plane sat down. A moment later its motors roared more\nthunderously. It is not safe to alight on either land or water when\nfog hangs low, but there is little danger in taking off.\n\nThe seaplane shot away into the mist, its motors bellowing. The sound\nof its going changed subtly. It seemed to rise, and grow more\ndistant.... It died away.\n\nBell halted at the top of the companion-ladder and saw the wireless\noperator, with a crooked, nervous grin upon his face.\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nBell saw what he was looking for, out in the throng of traffic that\nfilled the Avenida do Acre, in Rio. He'd seen it over the heads of the\ncrowd, which was undersized, as most Brazilian crowds are, and he\nmanaged to get through the perpetual jam on the mosaic sidewalk and\nreach the curb.\n\nHe stood there and regarded the vehicles filling the broad avenue,\nwearing exactly the indifferent, half-amused air of a tourist with no\nplace in particular to go and a great deal of time in which to go\nthere. Taxis chuffed past, disputing right of way with private cars\nwhich were engaged in more disputes with other cars, all in the rather\nextraordinary bad temper and contentiousness which comes to the\nLatin-American when he takes the wheel of an automobile.\n\nAs if coming to an unimportant decision, Bell raised his hand to an\napproaching cab. It had two men on the chauffeur's seat. Of course.\nAll taxis in Rio carry two men in front. One drives, and the other\nlights his cigarettes, makes witty comments upon passing ladies, and\nhelps in collecting the fares from recalcitrant passengers. The extra\nman is called the \"secretary,\" and he assists materially in giving an\nimpression of haughty pride.\n\nThe taxi ground to the curb. The secretary reached behind him\nindifferently and opened the door. Bell did not glance at him. He\nstepped inside and settled down languidly.\n\n\"The Beira Mar,\" he said listlessly.\n\nThe taxi started off with a jolt. It is the invariable custom in Rio\nde Janeiro. And besides, it reminds the passenger that he is merely a\ncustomer, admitted to the cab on suffrance, and that he must be\nsuitably meek to those who will presently blandly ignore the amount\nregistered by the meter and demand a fare of from eight to\ntwenty-seven times the indicated amount.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe cab went shooting down the Avenida do Acre toward the harbor. The\nAvenida do Acre is officially the Avenida Rio Blanco, and it should be\ncalled by that name, only people forget. The Beira Mar, however, is\nnamed with entire propriety. It is actually the edge of the sea, and\nit is probably one of the two or three most beautiful driveways in the\nworld.\n\nThe cab whirled past the crowded sidewalks. Incredible numbers of\npeople, with an incredible variation in the shades of their\ncomplexions, moved to and from with the peculiar aimlessness of a\nBrazilian crowd. A stout and pompous negro politician from Bahia,\nwearing an orchid in his button-hole, rubbed elbows with a striking\nblonde lady of the sidewalks on his left, and forced a wizened little\nsilk-hatted _parda_--approximately an octoroon--to dodge about him in\norder to progress. A young and languid person, his clothes the very\nlast expiring gasp of fashion, fingered his stick patiently. He wore\nthe painstakingly cultivated expression of bored disillusionment your\nyoung Brazilian dandy considers aristocratic. It was very probable\nthat he shared a particularly undesirable bedroom with four or five\nother young men in order to purchase such clothing, but then, _farenda\nfita_--making a picture--is the national Brazilian sport.\n\nBell lighted a cigarette. It was not wise to regard the secretary of\nthis particular taxi too closely, but if his face had been thickly\nsmeared with coal dust, and if he had had a two weeks' beard, and if\nhe had been seen on the forecastle of the _Almirante Gomez_, one would\nhave deduced him to be a stoker who had not used the name of Jamison.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe cab reached the Beira Mar, and turned to take the long route about\nthe bay. It is one of the most beautiful views to be found anywhere,\nand tall apartment houses have been built along its whole length to\ncapitalize the scenery. True, the more brightly-colored ladies of the\ncapital have established themselves in vast numbers among these\napartment houses, but in their languid promenades they add--let us\nsay--the beauties of art to those of nature.\n\nA voice spoke from the chauffeur's seat.\n\n\"Bell.\"\n\n\"Right,\" said Bell without moving. His eyes flickered, however, and he\nfound the device Jamison had inserted. A speaking-tube of sorts. Not\nespecially efficient, but inconspicuous enough. He stirred listlessly\nand got his lips near it.\n\n\"All right to talk?\" he asked briefly.\n\n\"Shoot,\" said Jamison from the secretary's seat beside the chauffeur.\n\"This man doesn't understand English, and he thinks I'm in a smuggling\ngang. He expects to make some money out of me eventually.\"\n\nBell spoke curtly, while the taxi rolled past the Morro da Gloria with\nits quaint old church and went along the winding, really marvelous\ndriveway past many beaches, with the incredibly blue water beyond.\n\n\"Canalejas is out of town,\" he said. \"It isn't known when he'll be\nback. I met his daughter at a dance at our Embassy here, and she told\nme. We didn't dare to talk much, but she's frightened. Especially\nafter what happened to Ortiz. And I've met Ribiera, whom Ortiz named.\"\n\n\"I've been looking him up,\" growled Jamison through the speaking-tube.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBell flicked the ash from his cigarette out the door, and went on\nquietly.\n\n\"He's trying to get friendly with me. I've promised to call at his\nhouse and have him take me out to the flying field. He has two planes,\nhe tells me, a big amphibian and a two-seater. Uses them for commuting\nbetween Rio and his place back inland. He went out of his way to\ncultivate me. I think he suspects I'm trying to find out something.\"\n\n\"Which you are,\" said Jamison dryly. \"You've found out that Ortiz was\nright at least about--\"\n\nBell nodded, and frowned at himself for having nodded. He spoke into\nthe mouthpiece by his head with an expressionless face.\n\n\"He's practically fawned upon by a bunch of important officials and\nseveral high ranking army officers. Suspecting what I do, I think he's\ngot hold of a devil of a lot of power.\"\n\nJamison scowled in a lordly fashion upon a mere pedestrian who\nthreatened to impede the movement of the taxicab by making it run over\nhim.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Ortiz,\" said Bell quietly, \"told me he'd been poisoned, and treason\nasked as the price of the antidote. I've heard that the Brazilian\nMinister for Foreign Affairs went insane six months ago. I heard,\nalso, that it was homicidal mania--murder madness. And I'm wondering\nif these people who fawn upon Ribiera aren't paying a price\nfor--well--antidotes, or their equivalent. The Minister for Foreign\nAffairs may have refused.\"\n\n\"You're improving,\" said Jamison dryly. The taxi rounded a curve and\na vista of sea and sand and royal palms spread out before it. \"Yes,\nyou're improving. But Ortiz spoke of Ribiera only as a deputy of The\nMaster. Who is The Master?\"\n\n\"God knows,\" said Bell. He stared languidly out of the window, for all\nthe world to see. A tourist, regarding the boasted beauties of the\nBiera Mar.\n\n\"A deputy,\" said Jamison without emotion, \"of some unknown person\ncalled The Master poisoned Ortiz in Buenos Aires. And Ortiz was an\nimportant man in the Argentine. Ribiera is merely the deputy of that\nsame unknown Master in Rio, and he has generals and state presidents\nand the big politicians paying court to him. If deputies in two\ncountries that we know of have so much power, how much power has The\nMaster?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSilence. The taxi chugged steadily past unnoticed beauties and\ncolorings. Rio is really one of the most beautiful cities in the\nworld.\n\n\"It's like this,\" said Jamison jerkily. \"Seven Service men vanish and\none goes mad. You get two tips that the fate of Ortiz is the fate of\nthe seven men--eight, in fact. We find that two men dispense a certain\nghastly poison in two certain cities, at the orders of a man they call\nThe Master. We find that those two men wield an astounding lot of\npower, and we know they're only deputies, only subordinates of the\nMaster. We know, also, that the Service men vanished all over the\nwhole continent, not in just those two cities. How many deputies has\nThe Master? What's it all about? He wanted treason of Ortiz, we know.\nWhat does he want of the other men his deputies have enslaved? Why did\nhe poison the Service men? And why--especially why--do two honorable\nmen, officials of two important nations, want to tip off the United\nStates Government about the ghastly business? What's it got to do with\nour nation?\"\n\nBell flung away his cigarette.\n\n\"That last question has occurred to me too,\" he observed, and\ncarefully repressed a slight shiver. \"I have made a guess, which is\nprobably insane. I'm going to see Ribiera this afternoon.\"\n\n\"He already suspects you know too much,\" said Jamison without\nexpression.\n\n\"I am\"--Bell managed the ghost of a mirthless smile--\"I am\nuncomfortably aware of it. And I may need an antidote as badly as\nOrtiz. If I do, and can't help myself, I'll depend on you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJamison growled.\n\n\"I simply mean,\" said Bell very quietly, \"that I'd really rather not\nbe--er--left alive if I'm mad. That's all. But Ortiz knew what was the\nmatter with him before he got bad off. I know it's a risk. I'm\ngoose-flesh all over. But somebody's got to take the risk. The guess\nI've made may be insane, but if it's right one or two lives will be\ncheap enough as a price for the information. Suppose you chaps turn\naround and take me to Ribiera's house?\"\n\nThere was a long pause. Then Jamison spoke in Portuguese to his\ncompanion. The taxi checked, swerved, and began to retrace its route.\n\n\"You're a junior in the Trade,\" said Jamison painstakingly. \"I can't\norder you to do it.\"\n\nBell fumbled with his cigarette case.\n\n\"The Trade doesn't exist, Jamison,\" he said dryly. \"And besides,\nnobody gives orders in The Trade. There are only suggestions. Now shut\nup a while. I want to try to remember some consular reports I read\nonce, from the consul at Puerto Pachecho.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"The consul there,\" said Bell, smiling faintly, \"was an amateur\nbotanist. He filled up his consular reports with accounts of native\nIndian medicinal plants and drugs, with copious notes and clinical\nobservations. I had to reprove him severely for taking up space with\nsuch matters and not going fully into the exact number of hides, wet\nand dry, that passed through the markets in his district. His\ninformation will be entirely useless in this present emergency, but\nI'm going to try to remember as much of it as I can. Now shut up.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen the taxi swung off the Biera Mar to thread its way through many\ntree-lined streets--it is a misdemeanor, punishable by fine, to cut\ndown a tree in Rio de Janeiro--it carried a young American with the\nair of an accomplished idler, who has been mildly bored by the\nincomparable view from the waterside boulevard. When it stopped at the\nfoot of one of the slum covered _morros_ that dot all Rio, and a\nliveried doorman came out of a splendid residence to ask the visitor\nhis name, the taxi discharged a young American who seemed to feel the\nheat, in spite of the swift motion of the cab. He wiped off his\nforehead with his handkerchief as he was assured that the Senhor\nRibiera had given orders he was to be admitted, night or day. When the\ntaxi drove off, it carried two men on the chauffeur's seat, of whom\none had lost, temporarily, the manner of haughty insolence which is\nnormally inseparable from the secretary of a taxicab chauffeur.\n\nBut though he wiped his forehead with his handkerchief, Bell actually\nfelt rather cold when he followed his guide through ornately furnished\nrooms, which seemed innumerable, and was at last left to wait in an\nespecially luxurious salon.\n\nThere was a pause. A rather long wait. A distinctly long wait. Bell\nlighted a cigarette and seemed to become mildly bored. He regarded a\nvoluptuous small statuette with every appearance of pleased interest.\nA subtly decadent painting seemed to amuse him considerably. He did\nnot seem to notice that no windows at all were visible, and that\nshaded lamps lit this room, even in broad daylight.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTwo servants came in, a footman in livery and the major-domo. Your\naverage _Carioca_ servant is either fawning or covertly insolent.\nThese two were obsequious. The footman carried a tray with a bottle,\nglass, ice, and siphon.\n\n\"The Senhor Ribiera,\" announced the major-domo obsequiously, \"begs\nthat the Senhor Bell will oblige him by waiting for the shortest of\nmoments until the Senhor Ribiera can relieve himself of a business\nmatter. It will be but the shortest of moments.\"\n\nBell felt a little instinctive chill at sight of the bottle and\nglasses.\n\n\"Oh, very well,\" he said idly. \"You may put the tray there.\"\n\nThe footman lifted the siphon expectantly. Bell regarded it\nindifferently. The wait before the arrival of this drink had been\nlonger than would be required merely for the announcing of a caller\nand the tending of a tray, especially if such a tray were a custom of\nthe place. And the sending of a single bottle only, without inquiry\ninto his preferences....\n\n\"No soda,\" said Bell. He poured out a drink into the tinier glass. He\nlifted it toward his lips, hesitated vaguely, and drew out his\nhandkerchief again.\n\nHe sneezed explosively, and the drink spilled. He swore irritably, put\ndown the glass, and plied his handkerchief vigorously. A moment later\nhe was standing up and pouring the drink out afresh, from the bottle\nin one hand to the glass in the other. He up-tilted the glass.\n\n\"Get rid of this for me,\" he said annoyedly of the handkerchief.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe saw a nearly imperceptible glance pass between the footman and the\nmajor-domo. They retired, and Bell moved about the room exactly like a\nyoung man who has been discomfited by the necessity of sneezing before\nservants. Anywhere else in the world, of course, such a pose would not\nhave been convincing. But your Brazilian not only adopts _fazenda\nfita_ as his own avocation, but also suspects it to be everybody\nelse's too. And a young Brazilian of the leisure class would be\nhorribly annoyed at being forced to so plebeian an exhibition in\npublic.\n\nHe moved restlessly about the room, staring at the picture. Presently\nhe blinked uncertainly and gazed about less definitely. He went rather\nuncertainly to the chair he had first occupied and sat down. He\npoured--or seemed to pour--another drink. Again he sneered, and looked\nmortified. He put down the glass with an air of finality. But he\nlooked puzzledly about him. Then he sank back in his chair and\ngradually seemed to sink into a sort of apathetic indifference.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe looked, then, like a very bored young man on the verge of dozing\noff. But actually he was very much alert indeed. He had the feeling of\neyes upon him for a while. Then that sensation ceased and he settled\nhimself to wait. And meantime he felt a particular, peculiar gratitude\nto the late American consul at Puerto Pachecho for his interest in\nmedicinal plants.\n\nThat gentleman had gone into the subject with the passionate\nenthusiasm of the amateur. He had described _icus_, _uirari_ and\n_timbo_. He had particularized upon _makaka-nimbi_ and _hervamoura_.\nAnd he had gone into a wealth of detail concerning _yagu\u00e9_, on account\nof its probable value if used in criminology. As consul at Puerto\nPachecho he was not altogether a success in some ways, but he had\ninvented an entirely original method of experimentation upon those\ndrugs and poisons which did not require to be introduced into the\nblood-stream. His method was simplicity itself. An alcoholic solution\n\"carried\" a minute quantity of the drug in its vapor, just as an\nalcoholic solution carries a minute quantity of perfuming essential\noil. He inhaled the odor of the alcoholic solution. The effect was\nimmediately, strictly temporary, and not dangerous. He was enabled to\ndescribe the odors, in some cases the tastes, and in a few instances\nthe effects of the substances he listed, from personal experience.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd Bell had used his method as an unpromising but possible test for a\ndrug in the drink that had been brought him. He inhaled the strangling\nodor of the spilled liquor on his handkerchief. And there was a drug\ninvolved. For an instant he was dizzy, and for an instant he saw the\nroom through a vivid blue haze. And something clicked in his brain and\nsaid \"It's _yagu\u00e9_.\" And the relief of dealing with something which he\nknew--if only at second-hand--was so enormous that he felt almost\nweak.\n\n_Yagu\u00e9_, you see, is an extract from the leaves of a plant which is\nnot yet included in materia medica. It has nearly the effect of\nscopolamine--once famous in connection with twilight sleep--and\nproduces a daze of blue light, an intolerable sleepiness, and\npractically all the effects of hypnotism. A person under _yagu\u00e9_, as\nunder scopolamine or hypnosis, will seem to slumber and yet will obey\nany order, by whomever given. He will answer any question without\nreserve or any concealment. And on awakening he will remember nothing\ndone under the influence of the potion. The effects are not\nparticularly harmful.\n\nBell then, sat in an apparent half-daze, half-slumber, in the salon in\nwhich he waited for Ribiera to appear. He knew exactly what he was\nexpected to do. Ribiera wanted to find out what he knew or suspected\nabout Ortiz's death. Ribiera wanted to know many things, and he would\nbelieve what Bell told him because he thought Bell had taken enough\n_yagu\u00e9_ to be practically an hypnotic subject. Let Ribiera believe\nwhat he was told!\n\nWhen he came into the room, bland and smiling, Bell did not stir. He\nwas literally crawling, inside, with an unspeakable repulsion to the\nman and the things for which he stood. But he seemed dazed and dull,\nand when Ribiera began to ask questions he babbled his answers in a\ntoneless, flat voice. He babbled very satisfactorily, in Ribiera's\nview.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen Ribiera shook him roughly by the shoulder he started, and let his\neyes clear. Ribiera was laughing heartily.\n\n\"Senhor! Senhor!\" said Ribiera jovially. \"My hospitality is at fault!\nYou come to be my guest and I allow you to be so bored that you drop\noff to sleep! I was detained for five minutes and came in to find you\nslumbering!\"\n\nBell stared ruefully about him and rubbed his eyes.\n\n\"I did, for a fact,\" he admitted apologetically. \"I'm sorry. Up late\nlast night, and I was tired. I dropped in to see those planes you\nsuggested I'd be interested in. But I daresay it's late, now.\"\n\nRibiera chuckled again. He was in his late and corpulent forties and\nwas something of a dandy. If one were captious, one might object to\nthe thickness of his lips. They suggested sensuality. And there was a\nshade--a bare shade--more of pigment in his skin than the American\npasses altogether unquestioned. And his hair was wavy.... But he could\nbe a charming host.\n\n\"We'll have a drink,\" he said bluntly, \"while the car's coming around\nto the door, and then go out to the flying field.\"\n\n\"No drink,\" said Bell, lifting his hand. \"I feel squeamish now. I say!\nHaven't you changed the lamps, or something? Everything looks\nblue....\"\n\nThat was a lie. Things looked entirely normal to Bell. But he looked\nabout him as if vaguely puzzled. If he had drunk the liquor Ribiera\nhad sent him, things would have had a bluish tinge for some time\nafter. But as it was....\n\nRibiera chaffed him jovially on the way to the flying field. And\nintroducing him to fliers and officials of the field, he told with\ngusto of Bell's falling asleep while waiting for him. A very jolly\ncompanion, Ribiera.\n\nBut Bell saw two or three men looking at him very queerly. Almost\nsympathetically. And he noticed, a little later, that a surprising\nnumber of fliers and officials of the airport seemed to be concealing\nan abject terror of Ribiera. One or two of them seemed to hate him as\nwell.\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nBell stepped out of a tall French window to a terrace, and from the\nterrace to the ground. There was a dull muttering in the sky to the\neast, and a speck appeared, drew nearer swiftly, grew larger, and\nbecame a small army biplane. It descended steeply to earth behind a\ntall planting of trees. Bell lighted a cigarette and moved\npurposelessly down an elaborately formalized garden.\n\n\"More victims,\" he observed grimly to himself, of the plane.\n\nRibiera lifted a pigmented hand to wave languidly from a shaded chair.\nThere were women about him, three of them, and it sickened Bell to see\nthe frightened assiduity with which they flattered him. Bell had met\nthem, of course. Madame the wife of the State President of Bahia--in\nthe United States of Brazil the states have presidents instead of\ngovernors--preferred the title of \"Madame\" because it was more foreign\nand consequently more aristocratic than Senhora. And Madame the wife\nof the General--\n\n\"Senhor,\" called Ribiera blandly, \"I have news for you.\"\n\nBell turned and went toward him with an air of pleased expectancy. He\nnoticed for the first time the third of the women. Young, in the first\nflush of youthful maturity, but with an expression of stark terror\nlingering behind a palpably assumed animation.\n\n\"An acquaintance of yours, Senhor,\" said Ribiera, \"is to be my\nguests.\"\n\nBell steeled himself.\n\n\"The Senhor Canalejas,\" said Ribiera, beaming, \"and his daughter.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBell seemed to frown, and then seemed to remember.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" he said carelessly, \"I met her in Washington. She was on\nthe _Almirante Gomez_, coming down.\"\n\nThe next instant he saw Ribiera's expression, and cursed himself for a\nfool. Ribiera's eyes had narrowed sharply. Then they half-closed, and\nhe smiled.\n\n\"She is charming,\" said Ribiera in drowsy contentment, \"and I had\nthought you would be glad to improve her acquaintance. Especially\nsince, as my friend, you may congratulate me. A contract of marriage\nis under discussion.\"\n\nBell felt every muscle grow taut. The fat, pigmented man before\nhim....\n\n\"Indeed,\" said Bell politely, \"I do congratulate you.\"\n\nRibiera looked at him with an expression in which a sardonic\nadmiration mingled with something else less pleasant.\n\n\"You are clever, Senhor Bell,\" he said heavily, seeming to sink more\ndeeply into his chair. \"Very clever.\" He shifted his eyes to the women\nwho stood about him. \"You may go,\" he said indifferently. His tone was\nexactly that of a despot dismissing his slaves. Two of them colored\nwith instinctive resentment. His eyes lingered an instant on the\nthird. Her face had showed only a passionate relief. \"You, Senhora,\"\nhe said heavily, \"may wait nearby.\"\n\nThe terror returned to her features, but she moved submissively to a\nspot a little out of earshot. Bell found his jaws clenched. There is a\ncertain racial taint widespread in Brazil which leads to an\nintolerable arrogance when there is the slightest opportunity for its\nexercise. Ribiera had the taint, and Bell felt a sickening wrath at\nthe terrified submission of the women.\n\n\"_Si_,\" said Ribiera, suddenly adverting to insolence. \"You are\nclever, Senhor Bell. Where did you learn of _yagu\u00e9_?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBell inhaled leisurely. His muscles were tense, but he gave no outward\nsign. Instead, he sat down comfortably upon the arm of a chair facing\nRibiera's. The only way to meet insolence is with equal insolence and\na greater calm.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Bell pleasantly. \"So you found out it didn't work, after\nall!\"\n\nRibiera's eyes contracted. He became suddenly enraged.\n\n\"You are trifling with me,\" he said furiously. \"Do you know the\npenalty for that?\"\n\n\"Why, yes,\" said Bell, and smiled amiably. \"A dose of--er--poison of\nThe Master's private brand.\"\n\nIt was a guess, but based on a good deal of evidence. Ribiera turned\ncrimson, then pale.\n\n\"What do you know?\" he demanded in a deadly quietness. \"You cannot\nleave this place. You are aware of that. The people here--guests and\nservants--are my slaves, the slaves of The Master. You cannot leave\nthis place except also as my slave. I will have you bound and given\n_yagu\u00e9_ so that you cannot fail to tell me anything that I wish to\nknow. I will have you tortured so that you will gladly say anything\nthat I wish, in return for death. I will--\"\n\n\"You will,\" said Bell dryly, \"drop dead with seven bullets in your\nbody if you give a signal for anyone to attack me.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRibiera stared at him as his hand rested negligently in his coat\npocket. And then, quite suddenly Ribiera began to chuckle. His rage\nvanished. He laughed, a monstrous, gross, cackling laughter.\n\n\"You have been my guest for two days,\" he gasped, slapping his fat\nknees, \"and you have not noticed that your pistol his been tampered\nwith! Senhor Bell! Senhor Bell! My uncle will be disappointed in you!\"\n\nIt seemed to impress him as a victory that Bell had been depending\nupon an utterly futile threat for safety. It restored his good humor\nmarvelously.\n\n\"It does not matter,\" he said jovially. \"Presently you will tell me\nall that I wish to know. More, perhaps. My uncle is pleased with you.\nYou recall your little talk with the wireless operator on the\n_Almirante Gomez_? You tried to learn things from him, Senhor. He\nreported it. Of course. All our slaves report. He sent his report to\nmy uncle, The Master, and I did not have it until to-day. I will admit\nthat you deceived me. I knew you had talked with Ortiz, who was a\nfool. I thought that in his despair he might have spoken. I gave you\n_yagu\u00e9_, as I thought, and informed my uncle that you knew nothing.\nAnd he is very much pleased with you. It was clever to deceive me\nabout the _yagu\u00e9_. My uncle has high praise for you. He has told me\nthat he desires your services.\"\n\nBell inhaled again. There was no question but that Ribiera was totally\nunafraid of the threat he had made. His gun must have been tampered\nwith, the firing-pin filed off perhaps. So Bell said placidly:\n\n\"Well? He desires my services?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRibiera chuckled, in his gross and horrible good humor.\n\n\"He will have them. Senhor. He will have them. When you observe your\nhands writhing at the ends of your wrists, you will enter his service,\nthrough me. Of course. And he will reward you richly. Money, much\nmoney, such as I have. And slaves--such as I have. The Senhora....\"\n\nRibiera looked at the terrified girl standing thirty or forty feet\naway. He chuckled again.\n\n\"My uncle desires that you should be induced to enter his service of\nyour own will. So, Senhor, you shall see first what my uncle's service\noffers. And later, when you know what pleasures you may some day\npossess as my uncle's deputy in your own nation, why, then the fact\nthat your hands are writhing at the ends of your wrists will be merely\nan added inducement to come to me. And I bear you no ill will for\ndeceiving me. You may go.\"\n\nBell rose.\n\n\"And still,\" he said dryly, \"I suspect that you are deceived. But now\nyou deceive yourself.\"\n\nHe heard Ribiera chuckling as he walked away. He heard him call,\namusedly, \"Senhora.\" He heard the little gasp of terror with which the\ngirl obeyed. He passed her, stumbling toward the gross fat man with\nthe light brown skin and curly hair. Her eyes were literally pools of\nanguish.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBell threw away his cigarette and began to fumble for another. He was\nbeginning to feel the first twinges of panic, and fought them down.\nRibiera had not lied. Bell had been at this _fazenda_ of his--which\nwas almost a miniature Versailles three hundred miles from Rio--for\ntwo days. In all that time he had not seen one person besides himself\nwho did not display the most abject terror of Ribiera. Ribiera had\nmade no idle boast when he said that everyone about, guests and\nservants, were slaves. They were. Slaves of a terror vastly greater\nthan mere fear of death. It--\n\n\"Senhor!... _Oh, Dios!_\" It was the girl's voice, in despair.\n\nRibiera laughed. Bell felt a red mist come before his eyes.\n\nHe deliberately steadied his hands and lighted his cigarette. He heard\nstumbling footsteps coming behind him. A hand touched his arm. He\nturned to see the girl Ribiera had pointed out, her cheeks utterly,\nchalky white, trying desperately to smile.\n\n\"Senhor!\" she gasped. \"Smile at me! For the love of God, smile at me!\"\n\nIn the fraction of a second, Bell was mad with rage. He understood,\nand he hated Ribiera with a corrosive hatred past conception. And then\nhe was deathly calm, and wholly detached, and he smiled widely, and\nturned and looked at Ribiera, and Ribiera's whole gross bulk quivered\nas he chuckled. Bell took the girl's arm with an excessive politeness\nand managed--he never afterward understood how he managed it--to grin\nat Ribiera.\n\n\"Senhora,\" he said in a low tone, \"I think I understand. Stop being\nafraid. We can fool him. Come and walk with me and talk. The idea is\nthat he must think you are trying to fascinate me, is it not?\"\n\nShe spoke through stiffened lips.\n\n\"Ah, that I could die!\"\n\nBell had a horrible part to play while he walked the length of the\nformal garden with her, and found a pathway leading out of it, and led\nher out of sight. He stopped.\n\n\"Now,\" he said sharply, \"tell me. I am not yet his slave. He has\nordered you....\"\n\nShe was staring before her with wide eyes that saw only despair.\n\n\"I--I am to persuade you to be my lover,\" she said dully, \"or I shall\nknow the full wrath of The Master....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBell asked questions, crisply, but as gently as he could.\n\n\"We are his slaves,\" she told him apathetically. \"I and _mi\nArturo_--my husband. Both of us....\" She roused herself little under\nBell's insistent questioning. \"We were guests at his house at dinner.\nOur friends, people high in society and in the Republic, were all\nabout us. We suspected nothing. We had heard nothing. But two weeks\nlater Arturo became irritable. He said that he saw red spots before\nhis eyes. I also. Then Arturo's hands writhed at the ends of his\nwrists. He could not control them. His nerves were horrible. And mine.\nAnd we--we have a tiny baby.... And Senhor Ribiera called upon my\nhusband. He was charming. He observed my husband's hands. He had a\nremedy, he said. He gave it to my husband. He became normal again. And\nthen--my hands writhed. Senhor Ribiera told my husband that if he\nwould bring me to him.... And I was relieved. We were grateful. We\naccepted the invitation of the Senhor Ribiera to this place. And he\nshowed us a man, in chains. He--he went mad before our eyes. He was a\nmember of the United States Secret Service.... And then the Senhor\nRibiera told us that we faced the same fate if we did not serve\nhim....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBell had thrust aside rage as useless, now. He was deliberately cold.\n\n\"And so?\"\n\n\"It is a poison,\" she said unsteadily. \"A deadly, a horrible poison\nwhich drives men murder mad in two weeks from the time of its\nadministration. The Senhor Ribiera has an antidote for it. But mixed\nwith the antidote, which acts at once, is more of the horrible poison,\nwhich will act in two weeks more. So that we are entrapped. If we\ndisobey him....\"\n\nBell began to smile slowly, and not at all mirthfully.\n\n\"I think,\" he said softly, \"that I shall gain a great deal of pleasure\nfrom killing the Senhor Ribiera.\"\n\n\"_Dios_--\" She strangled upon the word. \"Do you not see, Senhor, that\nif he dies we--we--\" She stopped and choked. \"We--have a tiny baby,\nSenhor. We--we would....\"\n\nAgain sick rage surged up in Bell. To kill Ribiera meant to drive his\nslaves mad, and mad in the most horrible fashion that can be imagined.\nTo kill Ribiera meant to have these people duplicate the death of\nOrtiz, as their greatest hope, or to fill madhouses with snarling\nanimals lusting to kill....\n\n\"It is--it is not only I, Senhor,\" said the girl before him. She was\nutterly listless, and in the agony of despair. \"It is Arturo, also.\nThe Senhor Ribiera has said that if I do not persuade you, that both\nArturo and I.... And our little baby, Senhor!... Our families also\nwill be entrapped some day. He has said so.... He will give that\npoison to our baby.... And it will grow up either his slave, or--\"\n\nHer eyes were pools of panic.\n\n\"Oh, God!\" said Bell very quietly. \"And he's offering me this power!\nHe's trying to persuade me to become like him. He's offering me\npleasures!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe laughed unpleasantly. And then he went sick with helplessness. He\ncould kill Ribiera, perhaps, and let only God know how many people go\nmad. Perhaps. Or perhaps Ribiera would merely be supplanted by another\nman. Ortiz had said that he killed The Master's deputy in Buenos\nAires, but that another man had taken his place. And the thing went\non. And The Master desired a deputy in the United States....\n\n\"Somehow,\" said Bell very softly, \"this has got to be stopped.\nSomehow. Right away. That devilish stuff! Can you get hold of a bit of\nthe antidote?\" he asked abruptly. \"The merest drop of it?\"\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n\"No, Senhor. It is given in food, in wine. One never knows that one\nhas had it. It is tasteless, and we have only Senhor Ribiera's word\nthat it has been given.\"\n\nBell's hands clenched.\n\n\"So devilish clever.... What are we going to do?\"\n\nThe girl stuffed the corner of her handkerchief into her mouth.\n\n\"I am thinking of my little baby,\" she said, choking. \"I must persuade\nyou, Senhor. I--I have been tearful. I--I am not attractive. I will\ntry. If I am not attractive to you....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBell cursed, deeply and savagely. It seemed to be the only possible\nthing to do. And then he spoke coldly.\n\n\"Listen to me, Senhora. Ribiera talked frankly to me just now. He\nknows that so far I am not subdued. If I escape he cannot blame you.\nHe cannot! And I am going to attempt it. If you will follow me....\"\n\n\"There is no escape for me,\" she said dully, \"and if he thinks that I\nknew of your escape and did not tell him....\"\n\n\"Follow me,\" said Bell, smiling queerly. \"I shall take care that he\ndoes not suspect it.\"\n\nHe gazed about for an instant, orienting himself. The plane that had\njust landed--the last of a dozen or more that had arrived in the past\ntwo days--had dipped down on the private landing field to the north.\n\nThere was a beautifully kept way running from the landing field to the\nhouse, and he went on through the thick shrubbery amid a labyrinth of\npaths, choosing the turnings most likely to lead him to it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe came out upon it suddenly, and faced toward the field. There were\ntwo men coming toward the house, on foot. One was a flying pilot,\nstill in his flying clothes. The other was a tall man, for a\nBrazilian, with the lucent clarity of complexion that bespeaks\nuncontaminated white descent. He was white-haired, and his face was\nqueerly tired, as if he were exhausted.\n\nBell looked sharply. He seemed to see a resemblance to someone he knew\nin the tall man. He spoke quickly to the girl beside him.\n\n\"Who is the man to the left?\"\n\n\"Senhor Canalejas,\" said the girl drearily. \"He is the Minister of\nWar. I suppose he, too....\"\n\nBell drew a deep breath. He walked on, confidently. As the two others\ndrew near he said apologetically:\n\n\"Senhores.\"\n\nThey halted with the instinctive, at least surface, courtesy of the\nBrazilian. And Bell was fumbling with his handkerchief, rather\nnervously tying a knot in it. He held it out to Canalejas.\n\n\"Observe.\"\n\nIt was, of course, a recognition-knot such as may be given to an\noutsider by one in the Trade. The tall man's face changed. And Bell\nswung swiftly and suddenly and very accurately to the point of the\nother man's jaw.\n\nHe collapsed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Senhor Canalejas,\" said Bell politely, \"I am about to go and steal an\nairplane to take what I have learned to my companion for transmission.\nIf you wish to go with me....\"\n\nCanalejas stared for the fraction of a second. Then he said quietly:\n\n\"But of course.\"\n\nHe turned to retrace his steps. Bell turned to the girl.\n\n\"If you are wise,\" he said gently, \"you will go and give the alarm. If\nyou are kind, you will delay it as much as you dare.\"\n\nShe regarded him in agonized doubt for a moment, and nodded. She fled.\n\n\"Now,\" said Bell casually, \"I think we had better hasten. And I hope,\nSenhor Canalejas, that you have a revolver. We will need one. Mine has\nbeen ruined.\"\n\nWithout a word, the white-haired man drew out a weapon and offered it\nto him.\n\n\"I had intended,\" he said very calmly, \"to kill the Senhor Ribiera.\nHis last demand is for my daughter.\"\n\nThey went swiftly. The plane Bell had seen alight some fifteen or\ntwenty minutes before was just being approached by languid mechanics.\nIt was, of course, still warm. Canalejas shouted and waved his arm\nimperiously. It is probable that he gave the impression of a man\nreturning for some forgotten thing, left in the cockpit of the plane.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhat happened then, happened quickly. A few crisp words in a low tone.\nA minor hubbub began suddenly back at the house. Canalejas climbed\ninto the passenger's seat as if looking for something. And Bell\npresented his now useless automatic pleasantly at the head of the\nnearest staring mechanic, and while he froze in horror, scrambled up\ninto the pilot's cockpit.\n\n\"Contact!\" he snapped, and turned on the switch. The mechanic remained\nfrozen with fear. \"Damnation!\" said Bell savagely. \"I don't know the\nPortuguese for 'Turn her over'!\"\n\nHe fumbled desperately about in the cockpit. Something whirred. The\npropeller went over.... Canalejas shot with painstaking accuracy,\ntwice. The motor caught with a spluttering roar.\n\nAs a horde of running figures, servants and guests, running with the\nsame desperation, came plunging out on the flying field from the\nshrubbery. Bell gave the motor the gun. The fast little plane's tail\ncame up off the ground as she darted forward. Faster and faster, with\nmany bumpings. The bumpings ceased. She was clear.\n\nAnd Bell zoomed suddenly to lift her over the racing, fear-ridden\ncreatures who clutched desperately at the wheels, and then the little\nship shot ahead, barely cleared the trees to the east of the field,\nand began to roar at her topmost speed toward Rio.\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nThe Trade--which does not exist--has its obligations and its code, but\nalso it has its redeeming features. When a man has finished his job,\nhe has finished it. And as far as the Trade was concerned, Bell had\nbut little more to do. But after that--and his eyes burned smokily in\ntheir depths--there was much that he intended to do. He sat in one of\nthe _bondes_ of the Botanical Garden half of the street railway system\nof Rio, and absent mindedly regarded the scenery. This particular\n_bonde_ was headed out toward the Lagoa Rodrigo de Freitas, by which\nsalty mass of water Bell would meet Paula Canalejas. He would receive\na package from her, which he would deliver to Jamison. And then he\nwould be free, and it was his private intention to engage in an\nenterprise which was very probably a form of suicide. But there are\nsome things one cannot dismiss with a sage reflection that they are\nnot one's business. This matter of Ribiera was definitely one of them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe escape from Ribiera's _fazenda_ had been relatively easy, because\nso thoroughly unexpected. The little plane had climbed to five\nthousand feet and found a stratum of cloud that stretched for very\nmany miles. Bell had emerged from it only twice in the first hour of\nflight, and the second time the sky was clear all about him. That he\nwas pursued, he had no doubt. That Ribiera had wireless communications\nwith Rio, he knew. And he knew that instant, and imperative orders\nwould have gone out for his capture.\n\nRio would not be a healthy place for him. If Ribiera had power over\nhigh government officials, he had surely indirect power over the\npolice, and a search for Bell would be in order at once. Yet Canalejas\nassuredly expected to return to Rio.\n\nA shouted question with the motor cut out, and a nodded answer. Bell\nheaded for Petropolis, which is Rio's only real summer resort and is\nhigh in the hills and only an hour and a half from it by train. It was\nsurprisingly satisfactory to be handling a swift plane again, and Bell\nallowed himself what he knew was about the only pleasure he was likely\nto have for some time to come.\n\nSomething of his hatred of Ribiera, however, came back as he prepared\nto land. He managed to crack the plane up very neatly, so that it\nwould be of no use to Ribiera any more. And at the same time, of\ncourse, the cracking-up provided an excellent excuse for Canalejas to\ncontinue on by train.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey talked very briefly by the puffing engine.\n\n\"It is best,\" said Canalejas, \"for you, Senhor, to remain here\novernight. I believe Senhor Ribiera has given orders for us both to be\nlooked for, yet as a Cabinet Minister I am still immune from arrest by\nthe ordinary police. If I reach my home I shall be able to do all that\nis necessary.\"\n\n\"And you will prepare a message for me to carry,\" said Bell.\n\n\"It is ready,\" said Canalejas. He smiled faintly. \"No, Senhor. I have\ninstructions to give my daughter. She will deliver the information to\nyou to-morrow. Let me see. At the edge of the Lagao Rodrigo de\nFeitas, at nine o'clock. She is the only messenger I can trust. I\nthink that is all.\"\n\nBell hesitated uncomfortably.\n\n\"But you, sir,\" he said awkwardly. \"You have been poisoned, as Senor\nOrtiz was.\"\n\n\"But certainly,\" said Canalejas. His smile was ironic as before. \"But,\nunlike Senor Ortiz, I have no hope. I have arranged for my daughter to\nconceal herself and escape from Brazil. I have prepared for\neverything, Senhor. As you know, I had intended to kill Senhor\nRibiera. In returning with you I have merely delayed my own death by a\nfew hours.\"\n\nStill smiling, and with the air of one entering a train for the most\ncasual of journeys, Canalejas entered the coach.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd Bell, sitting in the _bonde_ next morning, saw with an uncanny\nclarity the one weak point in Ribiera's hold upon his subjects. When\nthey had courage to fear nothing more than death, they could defy him.\nAnd not many could attain to that courage. But a few....\n\n\"I'll have some help, anyway,\" muttered Bell savagely to himself.\n\nIt is a long ride to the Botanical Gardens, from which one half the\nsurface lines of Rio take their name. On the way out to the Lagao\nRodrigo de Feitas, which, is close by the Garden itself, Bell had time\nto work over for the thousandth time the information he possessed, and\nrealize its uselessness. Two things, only, might be of service. One\nwas that Ribiera was the nephew of the person referred to as The\nMaster, and yet was evidently as much subjected to him as his own\nvictims to himself. The other was that the ultimate end of all the\nghastly scheme was in some fashion political. If wealth alone had been\nRibiera's aim, the gathering of his slaves would have had a different\naspect. The majority of them would have been rich men, men of\nbusiness, men who could pay out hundreds of thousands a month in the\ndesperate hope of being permitted to remain sane. There would not have\nbeen politicians and officials and officers of the army.\n\n\"The key men of the country,\" growled Bell inaudibly, \"enslaved to\nRibiera. They give him the power he's after more than cash. And it's\nthose key men who have more to lose than money. There's such a thing\nas honor....\"\n\nThree times the conductor stopped beside him and suggestively rattled\nthe coins in his box. Three times Bell absent mindedly paid the fare\nfor the zone. But the ride is a long one, and he had had time to\nrealize the hopelessness of any single-handed attack upon the thing he\nfaced long before the end.\n\nThen he absently moved through the amazing collection of tropic and\nnear tropic growths that is the Botanical Garden until he came at once\nto Paula and the Lagoa Rodrico de Freitas.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was alive with birds, and they hopped and pecked and squabbled\nwithout acrimony within feet of her seated figure. Bell knew that she\nhad been waiting for a long time. He looked quickly at her face. It\nwas quite pale, but entirely tearless.\n\n\"Here is the message, Senhor Bell,\" she said quietly, \"but I think I\nhave been followed.\"\n\nBell growled in his throat.\n\n\"I did not discover it until I reached this spot,\" she said evenly.\n\"And I did not know what to do. If I left, I would be seized and the\nmessage taken--and I think that someone would have waited here for\nyou. So, in part to gain time, and in part because I hoped you might\nhave some resource, I remained.\"\n\n\"How many of them?\" asked Bell shortly.\n\n\"Two,\" she said quietly. She looked at him, her large eyes entirely\ncalm and grave.\n\n\"Give me the package,\" said Bell briefly. \"They'll be more anxious to\nget it back than to bother you. And I'll either knock them cold or\nhold them in a scrap until you get away.\"\n\nShe reached in her pocket and handed him a small thick envelope. He\nstuffed it in the side pocket of his coat.\n\n\"I will walk away,\" he observed, \"and they'll follow me. Can you\narrange to give me some sign that you're safe?\"\n\n\"By the gateway,\" she told him. \"My handkerchief. I shall start as\nsoon as you have vanished. If I am followed, I will drop this\nhandkerchief, as it is. If I am not followed, I will tie a knot. But\nwhat can you do?\"\n\n\"I'll do something,\" said Bell coldly. \"Something!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe smiled, with the same odd bitterness her father had shown.\n\n\"My father--shot himself,\" she said briefly. \"I have no particular\nhope of doing better. But I shall not be Ribiera's slave.\"\n\nShe remained quite still. Bell moved away. He hurried. There was thick\njungle ahead, a section of the Gardens that is painstakingly preserved\nuntouched and undisturbed, that visitors to the capital of Brazil may\nobserve a typical sample of the virgin interior. He dived into that\njungle as if in flight.\n\nAnd very shortly after, two men dived in after him. They hesitated,\nthese men, because your policeman of Rio does not like to injure his\nuniform, and there are many thorns in jungle growths. But they entered\nit, having first drawn small glittering weapons. And then from the\njungle came silence.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt seemed to be silence. But there may have been some small unusual\nnoises. It would not be easy to tell if they were unusual or not,\nbecause there are peculiar flashes of charm in certain Brazilian\ninstitutions. The preservation of the spot of jungle itself is one.\nAnother is the fact that in the Gardens all manner of wild things\nlive at large and provide unexpected and delightful surprises to the\nusually foreign visitors.\n\nSo there were noises, after a bit. Such noises as some grunting wild\nthing might have made, perhaps. But they might also have been the\ngasping of a man as breath was choked out of him.... And there was a\ncracking sound a little later, which might--of course--have been any\none of any number of accidental and perfectly natural causes. And it\nmight have been a man upon whom another man had hurled himself, when\nthe second man landed on his jaw. And thrashing noises a little later\nmight have been anything.\n\nBut after what seemed a long time, Bell emerged. Alone. He was\nbreathing quickly, and there were scratches on his face and hands\nwhich--well, which might have been made by thorns. He went swiftly\nback toward the spot where Paula had waited. He looked cautiously. She\nwas gone.\n\nAnd then Bell went leisurely, in the studious fashion of a person\ngoing through the Botanical Gardens because it was the thing to do,\ntoward the gateway and the surface cars. As he neared the gate his\neyes roved with apparent casualness all about. He saw a tiny speck of\nwhite on the edge of the roadway. It looked as if it had been flung\nfrom a car. Bell picked it up. It was Paula's handkerchief, and there\nwas no knot whatever in it. In fact, its lacy edge was torn.\n\n\"They've got her,\" said Bell, apparently unmoved.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe waited for a car. A bulky figure wearing thick spectacles came\nplacidly from the Gardens. It waited, also, for the car. The car\narrived, in its two sections of first and second class; the first\nreserved for _cavalhieros_, which is to say persons wearing coat,\nshirt, collar, necktie, hat, shoes and socks, and carrying no parcel\nlarger than a brief case. Lesser folk who lacked any of the sartorial\nrequirements for admission to the first class section, or wore\n_tomancos_ instead of shoes, heaped themselves into the second section\nand paid one-third of the fare in the first.\n\nBell took his seat in the first section. It was comfortably filled.\nThe bulky person with the thick spectacles wedged himself carefully\ninto the space beside Bell. He unfolded a copy of the _Jornal do\nCommercio_ and began to regard the advertisements. Presently he found\nwhat he was looking for. \"_O Bicho_,\" said medium-sized type. Beside\nit was a picture of a kangaroo. The gentleman with the thick\nspectacles resignedly fished into his pockets and found a lottery\nticket. He tore it into scraps and threw them away. Then he began to\ngaze disinterestedly at the scenery and the other passengers in the\ncar.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBell drummed on his knee. With one's forefinger representing a dot,\nand one's second finger serving as a dash, it is surprising how\nnaturally and absentmindedly one may convey a perfectly intelligible\nmessage to a man sitting within a reasonable distance. When the man is\nalongside, the matter is absurdly simple.\n\nPresently the man with the thick lenses got out his paper again, as if\nbored by vistas such as no other city in the world can offer. His\npaper was in the pocket which pressed against Bell. If in getting out\nhis newspaper he also abstracted a thick fat envelope from Bell's\npocket and placed it in his own, and if all this took place under a\nsign--even in the section reserved for _cavalhieros_ of approved\nraiment--solemnly warning passengers against \"_batadores de\ncarteiras_,\" or pickpockets--well, it was an ironical coincidence\nwhose humor Bell did not see.\n\nHe was busily tapping out on his knee the briefest possible account of\nwhat he had learned at Ribiera's _fazenda_ up country.\n\n\"_One chance for me_,\" he tapped off at the end. \"_If I can kidnap\nRibiera I can make him talk. Somehow. He has big amphibian plane kept\nfueled and ready for long trip. I think he is back in Rio to direct\nhunt for me. Paula kidnapped. My job finished. On my own now._\"\n\nThe man with thick spectacles did not nod. He seemed to be looking\nidly at his paper, but it was folded at an article very discreetly\nphrased, beneath a photograph of Senhor Teixeira Canalejas, Minister\nof War, who had very unfortunately been found dead that morning. He\nhad been depressed, of late, but there were certain circumstances\nwhich made it as yet impossible to determine whether he had killed\nhimself or was the victim of an assassin.\n\n\"_Getting set for me_,\" tapped Bell grimly on his knee. \"_Ribiera told\nme too much._\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe man with thick spectacles yawned and turned the paper over. Under\na smaller headline--which would only find a place on a Brazilian\nsheet--\"A Regrettable Incident\"--an item of more direct importance was\nprinted. It told of an unnamed Senhor from the United States of the\nNorth America, who as the guest of a widely known Brazilian gentleman\nhad behaved most boorishly, had stolen an airplane from his host and\nbroken it to bits on landing unskilfully, and had vanished with\npriceless heirlooms belonging to his host. It read, virtuously:\n\n     No names are mentioned because the American Senhor has been\n     widely introduced in Rio society as a person with an\n     official status in Washington. It is understood that an\n     inquiry is to be made of the Ambassador as to the status of\n     the young man, before any action is taken by the police. It\n     is to be expected, however, that he will at least be\n     requested to leave the country.\n\nBell managed the barest flicker of a smile. Arrest, of course.\nDetention, most courteously arranged, while the Ambassador was\ncommunicated with. And Ribiera.\n\n\"_Give me dismiss_,\" he tapped on his knee.\n\nThe gentleman in the thick spectacles ran his finger thoughtfully\nabout the edge of his collar. In the Trade that is a signal of many\nvaried meanings. A hand across the throat in any fashion means, \"Clear\nout, your job is finished,\" \"Save your skin as best you can,\" and \"Get\naway without trying to help me,\" according to circumstances. In this\ncase it relieved Bell of all future responsibility.\n\nHe yawned, tapping his lips with the back of his hand, signaled for a\nstop of the car, and got out. Five minutes later he had signaled a\ntaxicab and given Ribiera's address. In six minutes he was being\nwhirled toward the one house in all Rio de Janeiro from which his\nchance of a safe departure was slightest. In little more than half an\nhour he had dismissed the cab and was gazing placidly into the\nstartled eyes of the doorman. The doorman, like all of Rio where\nRibiera was known and feared, knew that Bell was being hunted.\n\nBell handed over his card with an inscrutable air.\n\n\"The Senhor Ribiera,\" he said drily, \"returned to the city last night.\nPresent my card and say that I would like to speak to him.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe doorman ushered him inside and summoned the major-domo, still\nblinking his amazement. And the major-domo blinked again. But Bell\nfollowed with the air of an habitu\u00e9, as he was again ushered into the\nluxurious salon in which he had once been offered a drugged drink.\n\nAgain he sank down in a softly padded chair and surveyed the pictures\nand the minor objects of decadent art about him. Again he lighted a\ncigarette with every appearance of ease, and again had the impression\nof eyes upon him. The major-domo appeared, somewhat agitated.\n\n\"The Senhor Ribiera,\" he said harshly, \"will see you only if you are\nnot armed. He requires your word of honor.\"\n\nBell smiled lazily.\n\n\"I'll do better than that,\" he said languidly. \"I haven't had time to\nbuy a revolver. But the automatic he had put out of commission is in\nmy pocket. Present it to him with my compliments.\"\n\nHe handed over the weapon, butt first. The major-domo blinked, and\ntook it. Bell sat down and smiled widely. He had been expected to be\nuproarious, to attempt to force the major-domo to lead him to Ribiera.\nAnd, of course, he would have been led past a perfectly planned ambush\nfor his capture--but he might have killed the major-domo. Which would\nnot disturb Ribiera, but had disturbed the servant.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBell smoked comfortably. And suddenly hangings parted, and Ribiera\ncame into the room. He smiled nervously, and then, as Bell blew a puff\nof smoke at him and nodded casually, he scowled.\n\n\"I came,\" said Bell deliberately, \"to make a bargain. Frankly, I do\nnot like to break my word. I was under obligations to deliver a\npackage from Senhor Canalejas to a certain messenger who will take it\nto my government. I have done it. But I am not, Senhor Ribiera, a\nmember of the Secret Service. I am entirely a free agent now, and I am\nprepared to consider your proposals, which I could not in honor do\nbefore.\"\n\nHe smiled pleasantly. Effrontery, properly managed, is one of the most\nvaluable of all qualities. Especially in dealing with people who\nthemselves are arrogant when they dare.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRibiera purpled with rage, and then controlled it.\n\n\"Ah!\" he rumbled. \"You are prepared to consider my proposals. There\nare no proposals. The Master may be amused at your cleverness in\nescaping. I do not know. I do know that I am ordered to make you my\nslave and send you to The Master. That, I shall do.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Bell blandly: \"but I can go without food and drink for\nseveral days, which will delay the process. And while I cannot\nhonorably tell you how to stop the man bearing Senhor Canalejas'\npackage to my government, still ... If I willingly accepted a dose of\n_yagu\u00e9_ in token of my loyalty to The Master....\"\n\nRibiera's good humor returned. He chuckled.\n\n\"You actually mean,\" he said jovially, \"that you think you were given\nsome of The Master's little compound, and that you wish to make terms\nbefore your hands begin to writhe at the ends of your wrists. Is not\nthat your reason?\"\n\nBell's eyes flickered. He had been horribly afraid of just that. But\nRibiera's amusement was reassuring.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Bell. \"Perhaps I am.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRibiera sat down and stretched his fat legs in front of him. He\nsurveyed Bell with an obscene, horrible amusement.\n\n\"Ah, Senhor,\" he chuckled, \"some day we will laugh together over this!\nYou yet hope, and do not yet know how much better it will be for you\nif you cease to hope, and cultivate desires! The Master is pleased\nwith you. You have just those qualities he knows are necessary in\ndealing with your nation. He is not angry with you. It is his\nintention to use you to extend his--ah--influence among the officials\nof your nation. You know, of course, that in but a little more time I\nwill hold all Brazil--as I now hold this city--in the hollow of my\nhand. Four of the republics of this continent are already completely\nunder the control of The Master's deputies, and of the rest, Brazil is\nnot the most nearly subdued. A year or two, and The Master will\nbecome Emperor, and his deputies viceroys. And it is his whim to give\nyou the opportunity of becoming the first deputy and the first viceroy\nof North America. And you come to me and offer--you, Senhor!--to make\nterms! I believe even The Master will laugh when he hears of it.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Bell practically, \"do you accept my terms?\"\n\nRibiera chuckled again.\n\n\"What are they, Senhor?\"\n\n\"That you release the daughter of the Senhor Canalejas and pledge your\nword of honor that she will not be enslaved.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRibiera's word of honor, of course, would be worth rather less than\nthe breath that was used to give it. But his reception of the proposal\nwould be informative.\n\nHe chuckled again.\n\n\"No, Senhor. I do not accept. But I will promise you as a favor,\nbecause my uncle The Master admires you, that within a few weeks you\nshall enjoy her charms. I do not,\" he added with amused candor, \"find\nthat any one woman diverts me for a very long time.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Bell, very quietly.\n\nHe sat still for an instant, and then shrugged, and looked about as if\nfor an ash tray in which to knock the ashes from his cigarette. He\nstood up, carrying the tube of tobacco gingerly, and moved toward one\nby Ribiera's elbow. He knocked off the ash, and crushed out the tiny\ncoal. He fumbled in his pockets.\n\nThe next instant Ribiera choked with terror.\n\n\"Let me explain,\" said Bell softly. \"I did not give your major-domo my\nword that I was unarmed. I merely gave him a weapon. I got these from\ntwo policemen who tried to arrest me an hour or so ago. And I also\nremind you, Senhor, that if the armed men you have posted to prevent\nmy escape try to shoot me, that the inevitable contraction of my\nmuscles will send two bullets into your heart--even if I am dead. I\nam a dead man, Senhor, if you give the word, but so are you if you\ngive it.\"\n\nRibiera gasped. His eyes rolled in his head.\n\n\"Send for her,\" said Bell very gently. \"Send for her, Senhor. I\nestimate that she has been in this house for less than half an hour.\nHave her brought here at once, and if she has been harmed the three of\nus will perish very promptly, and half of Rio will go mad after our\ndeath.\"\n\nAnd the muzzles of two revolvers bored into the fat flesh of Ribiera's\nbody, and a gasp that was almost a wail of terror came from the\nwatchers--armed watchers--who dared not kill the man they had been\nposted to guard Ribiera against.\n\nRibiera lifted his hand and croaked an order.\n\n(_To be continued._)\n\n[Advertisement:]\n\n\n\n\nBrigands of the Moon\n\n(The Book of Gregg Haljan)\n\nPART THREE OF A FOUR-PART NOVEL\n\n_By Ray Cummings_\n\n[Illustration: Light-rays and silent flashes seemed to envelop us.]\n\n[Sidenote: Gregg and Anita risk quick, sure death in a desperate bluff\non the ruthless Martian brigands.]\n\n\n_WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE_\n\nOne day in 2075 the Interplanetary Space-Ship _Planetara_ left the\nEarth for Mars. I, Gregg Haljan, was third officer.\n\nIt was destined to be a tragic voyage. For in our midst were\nunscrupulous brigands, masquerading as harmless passengers, intent on\nseizing the secret treasure of radium ore Johnny Grantline of the\nGrantline Expedition had dug from the Moon. The _Planetara_ was to\nstop on the Moon and pick the treasure up on her return trip from\nMars.\n\nMiko, a giant Martian, and his sister, Moa, were the ringleaders. With\nthem were, as passengers, Sir Arthur Coniston and Ob Hahn, a Venus\nmystic. The whole crew was in their pay.\n\nMiko struck. The captain was killed, as were the officers. Only Snap\nDean, the radio-helio operator, Venza, a girl of Venus, and I were\nleft. And, of course, Anita Prince, who had captivated my heart upon\nmy first glimpse of her.\n\nThe brigands abandoned the other passengers on a small asteroid, and\nMiko signaled his space-ship far off on Mars to meet him on the Moon.\nI was forced to guide the _Planetara_ to the Moon. We sighted the huts\nof the Grantline Expedition, and suddenly, just as we started to\ndescend, the controls, snapped, and the _Planetara_ tumbled like a\nspent rocket! Desperately I tried to check her, but only partially\nsucceeded. We crashed horribly against the barren gray rock of the\nMoon. Anita, Venza, Snap and I lived through it, but we could not find\nthe bodies of Miko and Moa in the wreckage. Evidently they were still\nalive, somewhere.\n\nWe reached Johnny Grantline. The _Planetara_ was a complete wreck.\nAnd, speeding to us from Mars, was Miko's brigand ship.\n\nWe were powerless--without means of leaving the Moon--and completely\nat the mercy of Miko's fast approaching brigands!\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\n_The Prowling Watchman_\n\n\"Try it again,\" Snap urged. \"Good God, Johnny, we've got to raise some\nEarth station! Chance it! Use your power--run it up to the full.\nChance it!\"\n\nWe were gathered in Grantline's instrument room. The duty-man, with\nblanched grim face, sat at his senders. The Grantline crew shoved\nclose around us, tense and silent.\n\nAbove everything we must make some Earth station aware of our plight.\nConditions were against us. There were very few observers, in the\nhigh-powered Earth stations who knew that an exploring party was on\nthe Moon. Perhaps none of them. The Government officials who had\nsanctioned the expedition--and Halsey and his confr\u00e8res in the\nDetective Bureau--were not anticipating trouble now. The _Planetara_\nwas supposed to be well on her course to Ferrok-Shahn. It was when she\nwas due to return that Halsey would be alert.\n\nAnd it seemed, too, that nature was against us. The bulging\nhalf-Earth[1] hung poised near the zenith over our little crater. Its\nrotation through the hours was clearly visible. We timed our signals\nwhen the western hemisphere was facing us. But nature was against us.\nNo clouds, no faintest hint of mist could fog the airless Lunar\nsurface. But there were continuous clouds over the Americas.\n\n[Footnote 1: Between the half and the full illumined disc, the\ncomplete Earth now was some ten days old.]\n\n\"Try it again,\" Snap urged.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThese bulging walls! Grantline used his power far beyond the limits of\nsafety. He cut down his lights; the telescope intensifiers were\npermanently disconnected; the ventilators were momentarily stilled, so\nthat the air here in the little room crowded with men rapidly grew\nfetid. All to save power pressure, that the vital Erentz system might\nsurvive.\n\nEven so it was strained to the danger point. The walls seemed to bulge\noutward with the pressure of the room, the aluminite braces straining\nand creaking. And our heat was radiating away; the deadly chill of\nspace crept in.\n\n\"Again!\" ordered Grantline.\n\nThe duty-man flung on the power in rhythmic pulses. In the silence the\ntubes hissed. The light sprang through the banks of rotating prisms,\nintensified up the scale until, with a vague, almost invisible beam,\nit left the last swaying mirror and leaped through our overhead dome\ninto space.\n\n\"Commander!\" The duty-man's voice carried an appeal. These bulging\nwalls! If they cracked, or even sprung a serious leak, the camp would\nbe uninhabitable....\n\n\"Enough,\" said Grantline. \"Switch it off. We'll let it go at that for\nnow.\"\n\nIt seemed that every man in the room had been holding his breath in\nthe darkness. The lights came on again: the Erentz motors accelerated\nto normal. The strain on the walls eased up, and the room began\nwarming.\n\nHad the Earth caught our signal? We did not want to waste the power to\nfind out. Our receivers were disconnected. If an answering signal\ncame, we could not know it. One of the men said:\n\n\"Let's assume they saw us.\" He laughed, but it was a high-pitched,\ntense laugh. \"We don't dare even use the telescope. Our rescue ship\nwill be right overhead, visible to the naked eye before we see it.\nThree days more--that's what I'll give it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut the three days passed, and no rescue ship came. The Earth was\nalmost at the full. We tried signaling again. Perhaps it got\nthrough--we did not know. But our power was weaker now. The wall of\none of the rooms sprang a leak, and the men were hours repairing it. I\ndid not say so, but never once did I feel that our signals were seen\non Earth. Those cursed clouds! The Earth almost everywhere seemed to\nhave poor visibility.\n\nFour of our eight days of grace were all too soon passed. The brigand\nship must be half-way here by now.\n\nThey were busy days for us. If we could have captured Miko and his\nband, our danger would have been less imminent. With the treasure\ninsulated so that its Gamma rays could not betray us, and our camp in\ndarkness, the arriving brigand ship might never find us. But Miko knew\nour location: he would signal his oncoming ship when it was close and\nlead it to us.\n\nThree times during those days--and the days which followed\nthem--Grantline sent out searching parties. But it was unavailing.\nMiko, Moa and Coniston, with their five underlings, could not be\nfound. We searched all the territory from the camp to the _Planetara_,\nand off to the foot-crags of Archimedes, and a score of miles into the\nflatness of the Mare Imbrium. There was no sign of the brigands. Yet\nwe knew they could be near here--it was so easy to hide amid the\ntumbled crags, the ravines, the gullies, the numberless craters and\npit-holes: or underground in the vast honeycombed subterranean\nrecesses.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe had at first hoped that the brigands might have perished. But that\nwas soon dispelled! I went--about the third day--with the party that\nwas sent to the _Planetara_. We wanted to salvage such of its\nequipment, its unbroken power units, as might be available. And Snap\nand I had worked out an idea which we thought might be of service. We\nneeded some of the _Planetara's_ smaller gravity-plate sections. Those\nin Grantline's wrecked little _Comet_ had stood so long that their\nradiations had gone dead. But the _Planetara's_ were still\nefficacious.\n\nWe secured the fragments of Newtonia.[2] But our hope that Miko might\nhave perished was dashed. He too had returned to the _Planetara_! The\nevidence was clear before us. The vessel was stripped of all its power\nunits save those which were dead and useless. The last of the food and\nwater stores was taken. The weapons in the chart-room--the Benson\ncurve-lights, bullet projectors, and heat-rays--had vanished.\n\n[Footnote 2: An allusion to the element Newtonia, named in memory of\nthe great founder of celestial mechanics, Sir Isaac Newton.\nArtificially electronized, this metal element may be charged either\npositively or negatively, thus to attract or repell other masses of\nmatter. The gravity plates of all space-ships were built of it.]\n\nOther days passed. The Earth reached the full, and began waning. The\ntwenty-eight day Lunar night was in its last half. No rescue ship came\nfrom Earth. We had ceased our efforts to signal, for we needed all our\npower to maintain ourselves. The camp would be in a state of siege.\nThat was the best we could hope for. We had a few short-range weapons,\nsuch as Bensons, heat-rays and rifles. A few hundred feet of effective\nrange was the most any of them could obtain. The heat-rays--in giant\nform one of the most deadly weapons on Earth--were only slowly\nefficacious on the airless Moon. Striking an intensely cold surface,\ntheir warming radiations, without atmosphere to aid them, were slow\nto act. Even in a blasting heat-beam a man in his Erentz helmet-suit\ncould withstand the ray for several minutes.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe were, however, well equipped with explosives. Grantline had brought\na large supply for his mining operations, and much of it was still\nunused. We had, also, an ample stock of oxygen fuses, and a variety of\noxygen light flares in small fragile glass-globes.\n\nIt was to use these explosives against the brigands that Snap and I\nwere working out our scheme with the gravity-plates. The brigand ship\nwould come with giant projectors and with some thirty men. If we could\nhold out against them for a time, the fact that the _Planetara_ was\nmissing would bring us help from Earth.\n\n\"A month,\" said Grantline. \"A month at the most. If we can hold them\noff that long--even in a week or two help may come.\"\n\nAnother day. A tenseness fell on us all, despite the absorption of our\nfeverish activities. To conserve the power, the camp was almost dark,\nwe lived in dim, chill rooms, with just a few weak spots of light\noutside to mark the watchmen on their rounds. We did not use the\ntelescope,[3] but there was scarcely an hour when one or the other of\nthe men was not sitting on a cross-piece up in the dome of the little\ninstrument room, casting tense searching gaze into the black, starry\nfirmament. A ship might appear at any time now--a rescue ship from\nEarth, or the brigands from Mars.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnita and Venza during these days could aid us very little save by\ntheir cheering words. They moved about the rooms, trying to inspire\nus; so that all the men, when they might have been humanly sullen and\ncursing their fate, were turned to grim activity, or grim laughter,\nmaking a joke of this coming siege. The morale of the camp now was\nperfect. An improvement indeed over the inactivity of the former\npeaceful weeks!\n\n[Footnote 3: An old-fashioned telescope, of limited field and needing\nno electronic power, would have been immensely serviceable to\nGrantline, but his was of the more modern type.]\n\nGrantline mentioned it to me. \"We'll put up a good fight, Haljan.\nThese fellows from Mars will know they've had a task before they ever\nsail off with this treasure.\"\n\nI had many moments alone with Anita. I need not mention them. It\nseemed that our love was crossed by the stars, with an adverse fate\ndooming it. And Snap and Venza must have felt the same. Among the men\nwe were always quietly, grimly active. But alone.... I came upon Snap\nonce with his arms around the little Venus girl. I heard him say:\n\n\"Accursed luck! That you and I should find each other too late, Venza.\nWe could have a mighty lot of fun in Great-New York together.\"\n\n\"Snap, we will!\"\n\nAs I turned away, I murmured: \"And, pray God, so will Anita and I.\"\n\nThe girls slept together in a small room of the main building. Often\nduring the time of sleep, when the camp was stilled except for the\nnight watch, Snap and I would sit in the corridor near the girls'\ndoor-grid, talking of that time when we would all be back on our\nblessed Earth.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOur eight days of grace were passed. The brigand ship was due--now,\nto-morrow, or the next day.\n\nI recall, that night, my sleep was fitfully uneasy. Snap and I had a\ncubby together. We talked, and made futile plans. I went to sleep, but\nawakened after a few hours. Impending disaster lay heavily on me. But\nthere was nothing abnormal nor unusual in that!\n\nSnap was asleep. I was restless, but I did not have the heart to\nawaken him. He needed what little repose he could get. I dressed, left\nour cubby and wandered out into the corridor of the main building.\n\nIt was cold in the corridor, and gloomy with the weak blue light. An\ninterior watchman passed me.\n\n\"All as usual, Haljan.\"\n\n\"Nothing in sight?\"\n\n\"No. They're looking.\"\n\nI went through the connecting corridor to the adjacent building. In\nthe instrument-room several of the men were gathered, scanning the\nvault overhead.\n\n\"Nothing, Haljan.\"\n\nI stayed with them awhile, then wandered away. The outside man met me\nnear the admission lock-chambers of the main building. The duty-man\nhere sat at his controls, raising the air-pressure in the locks\nthrough which the outside watchman was coming. The relief sat here in\nhis bloated suit, with his helmet on his knees. It was Wilks.\n\n\"Nothing yet, Haljan. I'm going up to the peak of the crater to see if\nanything is in sight. I wish that damnable brigand ship would come and\nget it over with.\"\n\nInstinctively we all spoke in half whispers, the tenseness bearing in\non us.\n\nThe outside man came out of his helmet. He was white and grim, but he\ngrinned at Wilks.\n\n\"All is usual.\" He tried the familiar jest at Wilks, but his voice was\nflat: \"Don't let the Earthlight get you!\"\n\nWilks went out through the portes--a process of no more than a minute.\nI wandered away again through the corridors.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI suppose it was half an hour later that I chanced to be gazing\nthrough a corridor window. The lights along the rocky cliff-edge were\ntiny blue spots. The head of the stairway leading down to the abyss of\nthe crater floor was visible. The bloated figure of Wilks was just\ncoming up. I watched him for a moment making his rounds. He did not\nstop to inspect the lights. That was routine; I thought it queer that\nhe passed them.\n\nAnother minute passed. The figure of Wilks went with slow bounds over\ntoward the back of the ledge where the glassite shelter housed the\ntreasure. It was all dark off there. Wilks went into the gloom, but\nbefore I lost sight of him he came back. As though he had changed his\nmind he headed for the foot of the staircase which led up the\ncliff-face to where, at the peak of the little crater, five hundred\nfeet above us, the narrow observatory platform was perched. He climbed\nwith easy bounds, the light on his helmet bobbing in the gloom.\n\nI stood watching. I could not tell why there seemed to be something\nqueer about Wilks' actions. But I was struck with it, nevertheless. I\nwatched him disappear over the peak of the summit.\n\nAnother minute went by. Wilks did not reappear. I thought I could make\nout his light on the platform up there. Then abruptly a tiny white\nbeam was waving from the observatory platform! It flashed once or\ntwice, then was extinguished. And now I saw Wilks plainly, standing in\nthe Earthlight, gazing down.\n\nQueer actions! Had the Earthlight touched him? Or was that a local\nsignal-call which he had sent out? Why should Wilks be signalling?\nWhat was he doing with a hand-helio? Our watchmen, I knew, had no\nreason to carry one.\n\nAnd to whom could Wilks be signalling across this Lunar desolation?\nThe answer stabbed at me: to Miko's band!\n\nI waited another moment. No further light. Wilks was still up there!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI went back to the lock entrance. Spare suits and helmets were here\nbeside the keeper. He gazed at me inquiringly.\n\n\"I'm going out, Franck, just for a minute.\" It struck me that perhaps\nI was a meddlesome fool. Wilks, of all Grantline's men, was, I knew,\nmost in his commander's trust. The signal could have been some part of\nthis night's ordinary routine, for all I knew.\n\nI was hastily donning an Erentz suit. I added, \"Let me out. I just got\nthe idea Wilks is acting queerly.\" I laughed. \"Maybe the Earthlight\nhas touched him.\"\n\nWith my helmet on I went through the locks. Once outside, with the\nouter panel closed behind me, I dropped the weights from my belt and\nshoes and extinguished my helmet-light.\n\nWilks was still up there. Apparently he had not moved. I bounded off\nacross the ledge to the foot of the ascending stairs. Did Wilks see me\ncoming? I could not tell. As I approached the stairs the platform was\ncut off from my line of vision.\n\nI mounted with bounding leaps. In my flexible gloved hand I carried my\nonly weapon, a small bullet projector with oxygen firing caps for use\nin this outside near-vacuum. The leaden bullet with its slight mass\nwould nevertheless pierce a man at the distance of twenty feet.\n\nI held the weapon behind me. I would talk to Wilks first.\n\nI went slowly up the last hundred feet. Was Wilks still up there? The\nsummit was bathed in Earthlight. The little metal observatory platform\ncame into view above my head.\n\nWilks was not there. Then I saw him standing on the rocks nearby,\nmotionless. But in a moment he saw me coming.\n\nI waved my left arm with a gesture of greeting. It seemed to me that\nhe started, made as though to leap away, then changed his mind and\nwaited for me.\n\nI sailed from the head of the staircase with a twenty-foot leap and\nlanded lightly beside him. I gripped his arm for audiphone contact.\n\n\"Wilks!\"\n\nThrough the visors his face was visible. I saw him, and he saw me. And\nI heard his voice.\n\n\"You, Haljan! How nice!\"\n\nIt was not Wilks, but the brigand Coniston!\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\n_Imprisoned!_\n\nThe duty-man at the exit locks of the main building stood at his\nwindow and watched me curiously. He saw me go up the spider-stairs. He\ncould see the figure he thought was Wilks, standing at the top. He saw\nme join Wilks, saw us locked together in combat.\n\nFor an instant the duty-man stood amazed. There were two fantastic,\nmisshapen figures swaying in the Earthlight five hundred feet above\nthe camp, fighting desperately at the very brink. They were small,\ndwarfed by distance, alternately dim and bright as they swayed in and\nout of the shadows. Soon the duty-man could not tell one from the\nother. Haljan and Wilks--fighting to the death!\n\nThe duty-man recovered himself and sprang into action. An interior\nsiren-call was on the instrument panel near him. He rang it, alarming\nthe camp.\n\nThe men came rushing to him, Grantline among them.\n\n\"What's this? Good God, Franck!\"\n\nThey saw the silent, deadly combat up there on the cliff. The two\nfigures had fallen together from the observatory platform, dropped\ntwenty feet to a lower landing on the stairs. They lay as though\nstunned for a moment, then fought on.\n\nGrantline stood stricken with amazement. \"That's Wilks!\"\n\n\"And Haljan,\" the duty-man gasped. \"Went out--something wrong with\nWilks--acting strangely--\"\n\nThe interior of the camp was in a turmoil. The men awakened from\nsleep, ran out into the corridors, shouted questions.\n\n\"An attack?\"\n\n\"Is it an attack?\"\n\n\"The brigands?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut it was Wilks and Haljan in a fight out there on the cliff. The men\ncrowded at the bulls'-eye windows.\n\nAnd over all the confusion the alarm siren, with no one thinking to\nshut it off, was screaming with its electrical voice.\n\nGrantline, stricken for that moment of inactivity, stood gazing. One\nof the figures broke away from the other, bounded up to the summit\nfrom the stair-platform to which they had fallen. The other followed.\nThey locked together, swaying at the brink. For an instant it seemed\nto Grantline that they would go over; then they surged back,\nmomentarily out of sight.\n\nGrantline found his wits. \"Stop them! I'll go out to stop them! What\nfools!\"\n\nHe was hastily donning one of the Erentz suits which stood at the lock\nentrance. \"Shut off that siren, Franck!\"\n\nWithin a minute Grantline was ready. The duty-man called from the\nwindow:\n\n\"Still at it! By the infernal, such fools! They'll kill themselves!\"\n\nThe figures had swayed back into view, then out of sight again.\n\n\"Franck, let me out.\"\n\nGrantline was ready. He stood, helmet in hand.\n\n\"I'll go with you, Commander.\"\n\nBut the volunteer was not equipped. Grantline would not wait.\n\n\"I'm going at once. Hurry, Franck.\"\n\nThe duty-man turned to his panel. The volunteer shoved a weapon at\nGrantline. \"Here, take this.\"\n\nGrantline jammed on his helmet.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe moved the few steps into the small air-chamber which was the first\nof the three pressure locks. Its interior door-panel swung open for\nhim. But the door did not close after him!\n\nCursing the duty-man's slowness, he waited a few seconds. Then he\nturned to the corridor. The duty-man came running.\n\nGrantline took off his helmet. \"What in hell--\"\n\n\"Broken! Dead!\"\n\n\"What!\"\n\n\"Smashed from outside,\" gasped the duty-man. \"Look there--my tubes--\"\n\nThe control-tubes of the portes had flashed into a close-circuit and\nburned out. The admission portes would not open!\n\n\"And the pressure controls smashed! Broken from outside--!\"\n\nThere was no way now of getting out through these pressure-locks. The\ndoors, the entire pressure-lock system, was dead. Had it been tampered\nwith from outside?\n\nAs though to answer Grantline's amazed question there came a chorus of\nshouts from the men at the corridor windows.\n\n\"Commander! By God--look!\"\n\nA figure was outside, close to the building! Clothed in suit and\nhelmet, it stood, bloated and gigantic. It had evidently been lurking\nat the porte-entrance, had ripped out the wires there.\n\nIt moved past the windows, saw the staring faces of the men, and made\noff with giant bounds. Grantline reached the window in time to see it\nvanish around the building corner.\n\nIt was a giant figure, larger than a normal Earthman. A Martian?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUp on the summit of the crater the two small figures were still\nfighting. All this turmoil had taken no more than a minute or two.\n\nA lurking Martian outside? The brigand, Miko? More than ever,\nGrantline was determined to get out. He shouted to his men to don some\nof the other suits, and called for some of the hand bullet projectors.\n\nBut he could not get out through these main admission portes. He could\nhave forced the panels open perhaps; but with the pressure-changing\nmechanisms broken, it would merely let the air out of the corridor. A\nrush of air, probably uncontrollable. How serious the damage was no\none could tell as yet. It would perhaps take hours to repair it.\n\nGrantline was shouting. \"Get those weapons! That's a Martian outside!\nThe brigand leader, probably! Get into your suits, anyone who wants to\ngo with me! We'll go by the manual emergency exit!\"\n\nBut the prowling Martian had found it! Within a minute Grantline was\nthere. It was a smaller, two-lock gateway of manual control, so that\nthe person going out could operate it himself. It was in a corridor at\nthe other end of the main building. But Grantline was too late! The\nlever would not open the panels!\n\nHad someone gone out this way and broken the mechanisms after him? A\ntraitor in the camp? Or had someone come in from outside? Or had the\nskulking Martian outside broken this lock as he had broken the other?\n\nThe questions surged on Grantline. His men crowded around him. The\nnews spread. The camp was a prison. No one could get out.\n\nAnd outside, the skulking Martian had disappeared. But Wilks and\nHaljan were still fighting. Grantline could see the two figures up on\nthe observatory platform. They bounded apart, then together again.\nCrazily swaying--bouncing--striking the rail.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey went together in a great leap off the platform onto the rocks,\nand rolled in a bright patch of Earthlight. First one on top, then the\nother, they rolled, unheeding, to the brink. Here, beyond the midway\nledge which held the camp, it was a sheer drop of a thousand feet, on\ndown to the crater-floor.\n\nThe figures were rolling: then one shook himself loose, rose up,\nseized the other and, with a desperate lunge, shoved him--\n\nThe victorious figure drew back to safety. The other fell, hurtling\ndown into the shadows past the camp-level--down out of sight in the\ndarkness of the crater-floor.\n\nSnap, who was in the group near Grantline at the windows, gasped.\n\n\"God! Was that Gregg Haljan who fell?\"\n\nNo one could say. No one answered. Outside, on the camp-ledge, another\nhelmeted figure now became visible. It was not far from the main\nbuilding when Grantline first noticed it. It was running fast,\nbounding toward the spider-staircase. It began mounting.\n\nAnd now still another figure became visible--the giant Martian again.\nHe appeared from around the corner of the main Grantline building. He\nevidently saw the winner of the combat on the cliff, who now was\nstanding in the Earthlight, gazing down. And he saw, too, no doubt,\nthe second figure mounting the stairs. He stood quite near the window\nthrough which Grantline and his men were gazing, with his back to the\nbuilding, looking up to the summit. Then he ran with tremendous leaps\ntoward the ascending staircase.\n\nWas it Haljan standing up there on the summit? Who was it climbing the\nstaircase? And was the third figure Miko?\n\nGrantline's mind framed the questions. But his attention was torn from\nthem, and torn even from the swift silent drama outside. The corridor\nwas ringing with shouts.\n\n\"We're imprisoned! Can't get out! Was Haljan killed? The brigands are\noutside!\"\n\nAnd then an interior audiphone blared a call for Grantline. Someone in\nthe instrument room of the adjoining building was talking:\n\n\"Commander, I tried the telescope to see who got killed--\"\n\nBut he did not say who got killed, for he had greater news.\n\n\"Commander! The brigand ship!\"\n\nMiko's reinforcements from Mars had come.\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\n_The Combat on the Crater-top_\n\nNot Wilks, but Coniston! His drawling, British voice:\n\n\"You, Gregg Haljan! How nice!\"\n\nHis voice broke off as he jerked his arm from me. My hand with the\nbullet-protector came up, but with a sweeping blow he struck my\nwrist. The weapon dropped to the rocks.\n\nI fought instinctively, those first moments; my mind was whirling with\nthe shock of surprise. This was not Wilks, but the brigand Coniston.\n\nHis blow wrenched him around. Awkward, fighting in the air-puffed\nsuits, with only a body-weight of some thirty pounds! Coniston\nstumbled over the rocks. I had still scarce recovered my wits, but I\navoided his outflung arms, and, stooping, tried to recover my\nrevolver. It lay nearby. But Coniston followed my scrambling steps and\nfell upon me. My foot struck the weapon; it slid away and fell down a\ncrag into a six-foot pit.\n\nWe locked together, and when I rose erect he had me around the middle.\nHis voice jangled with broken syllables in my receiver.\n\n\"Do for you now, Haljan--\"\n\nIt was an eery combat. We swayed, shoving, kicking, wrestling. His\nhold around my middle shut off the Erentz circulation; the warning\nbuzz rang in my ears to mingle with the rasp of his curses. I flung\nhim off, and my tiny Erentz motors recovered. He staggered away, but\nin a great leap came at me again.\n\nI was taller, heavier and far stronger than Coniston. But I found him\ncrafty, and where I was awkward in handling my lightness, he seemed\nmore skilfully agile.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI became aware that we were on the twenty-foot square grid of the\nobservatory platform. It had a low metal railing. We surged against\nit. I caught a dizzying glimpse of the abyss. Then it receded as we\nbounced the other way. And then we fell to the grid. His helmet bashed\nagainst mine, striking as though butting with the side of his head to\npuncture my visor-panel. His gloved fingers were trying to rip at the\nfabric around my throat.\n\nAs we regained our feet, I flung him off, and bounded, like a diver,\nhead-first into him. He went backward, but skilfully kept his feet,\ngripped me again and shoved me.\n\nI was tottering at the head of the staircase--falling. But I clutched\nat him.\n\nWe fell some twenty or thirty feet to the next lower spider landing.\nThe impact must have dazed us both. I recall my vague idea that we had\nfallen down the cliff--my Erentz motors smashed--my air shut off. Then\nthe air came again. The roaring in my ears was stilled; my head\ncleared, and I found that we were on the landing--fighting.\n\nHe presently broke away from me, bounded to the summit, with me after\nhim. In the close confines of the suit I was bathed in sweat, and\ngasping. I had had no thought to increase the oxygen content of my\nair. But I sorely needed more oxygen for my laboring, pounding heart\nand my panting breath. I fumbled for the oxygen control-lever. I could\nnot find it; or it would not operate.\n\nI realized I was fighting sluggishly, almost aimlessly. But so was\nConiston!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt seemed dreamlike. A phantasmagoria of blows and staggering steps. A\nnightmare with only the horrible vision of this goggled helmet always\nbefore my eyes.\n\nIt seemed that we were rolling on the ground, back on the summit. The\nunshadowed Earthlight was clear and bright. The abyss was beside me.\nConiston, rolling, was now on top, now under me, trying to shove me\nover the brink. It was all like a dream--as though I were asleep,\ndreaming that I did not have enough air.\n\nI strove to keep my senses. He was struggling to roll me over the\nbrink. Ah, that would not do! But I was so tired. One cannot fight\nwithout oxygen!\n\nI suddenly knew that I had shaken him off and gained my feet. He rose\nup, swaying. He was as tired, confused, half-asphyxiated as I.\n\nThe brink of the abyss was behind us. I lunged, desperately shoving,\navoiding his clutch.\n\nHe went over, and fell soundlessly, his body whirling end over end\ndown into the shadows, far down.\n\nI drew back. My senses faded as I sank panting to the rocks. But with\ninactivity, my thumping heart quieted. My respirations slowed. The\nErentz circulation gained on my poisoned air. It purified.\n\nThat blessed oxygen! My head cleared again. Strength came to me. I\nfelt better.\n\nConiston had fallen to his death. I was victor. I went to the brink,\ncautiously, for I was still dizzy. I could see, far down there on the\ncrater-floor, a little patch of Earthlight in which a mashed human\nfigure was lying.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI staggered back again. A moment or two must have passed while I stood\nthere on the summit, with my senses clearing and my strength renewed\nas the blood-stream cleared in my veins.\n\nI was victor. Coniston was dead. I saw now, down on the lower\nstaircase below the camp-ledge, another goggled figure lying huddled.\nThat was Wilks, no doubt. Coniston had doubtless caught him there,\nsurprised him, killed him.\n\nMy attention, as I stood gazing, went down to the camp-buildings.\nAnother figure was outside! It bounded along the ledge, reached the\nfoot of the ascending staircase at the top of which I was standing.\nWith agile leaps, it came mounting at me!\n\nAnother brigand! Miko? No, it was not large enough to be Miko, not\nnearly large enough. I was still confused. I thought of Hahn. But that\nwas absurd. Hahn was in the wreck of the _Planetara_. One of the\nstewards then....\n\nThe figure came up the staircase recklessly, to assail me. I took a\nstep backward, bracing myself to receive this new antagonist.\n\nAnd then I saw Miko! Unquestionably he: for there was no mistaking\nhis giant figure. He was down on the camp-ledge, running toward the\nfoot of the staircase, coming up to help this other man in advance of\nhim.\n\nI thought of my revolver. I turned to try and find it. I was aware\nthat the first of my assailants was at the stairhead. I could not\nlocate at once where the revolver had fallen. I would be caught,\nleaped upon from behind. Should I run?\n\nI swung back to see what the oncoming brigand was doing. He had\nreached the summit. His arms went up, legs bent under him. With a\nsailing leap he launched for me. I could have bounded way, but with a\nlast look to locate the revolver, I braced myself for the shock.\n\nThe figure hit me. It was small and light in my clutching arms. I\nrecall I saw that Miko was half-way up the staircase. I gripped my\nassailant. The audiphone contact brought a voice.\n\n\"Gregg! Is it you?\"\n\nIt was Anita clutching at me!\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\n_At Bay_\n\n\"Gregg, you're safe!\"\n\nShe had heard the camp corridors resounding with the shouts that Wilks\nand Haljan were fighting. She had come upon a suit and helmet by the\nmanual emergency lock, had run out through the lock, confused, with\nher only idea to stop Wilks and me from fighting. Then she had seen\none of us killed. Impulsive, barely knowing what she was doing, she\nmounted the stairs, frantic to find if I were alive.\n\n\"Anita!\"\n\nMiko was coming! She had not seen him: for she had no thought of\nbrigands--only the belief that either Wilks or I had been killed.\n\nBut now, as for an instant we stood together on the rocks near the\nobservation platform, I could see the towering figure of Miko nearing\nthe top of the stairs.\n\n\"Anita, that's Miko! We must run.\"\n\nThen I saw my bullet projector. It lay in a bowl-like depression quite\nnear us. I jumped for it. And as I tore loose from Anita, she leaped\ndown after me. It was a broken bowl in the rocks, some six feet deep.\nIt was open on the side facing the staircase--a narrow, ravinelike\ngully, full of gray, broken, tumbled rock-masses. The little gully was\nlittered with crags and boulders. But I could see out through it.\n\nMiko had come to the head of the staircase. He stopped there, his\ngreat figure etched sharply by the Earthlight. I think he must have\nknown that Coniston was the one who had fallen over the cliff, as my\nhelmet and Coniston's were different enough for him to recognize which\nwas which. He did not know who I was, but he did know me for an enemy.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe stood now at the summit, peering to see where we had gone. He was\nno more than fifty feet from us.\n\n\"Anita, lie down.\"\n\nI pulled her down on the rocks. I took aim with the bullet projector.\nBut I had forgotten our helmet-lights. Miko must have seen them just\nas I pulled the trigger. The flying bullet missed him as he jumped\nsidewise. He dropped, but I could see him moving in the shadows to\nwhere a jutting rock gave him shelter. I fired again.\n\n\"Gregg.\"\n\nI had stood up to take aim. I saw the bullet chip a bit of rock. Anita\npulled me sharply down beside her.\n\n\"Gregg, he's armed!\"\n\nIt was his turn to fire. It came--the familiar vague flash of the\nparalyzing ray. It spat its tint of color on the rocks near us, but\ncould not reach us.\n\nMiko rose a moment later and bounded to another rock. I scrambled up,\nand shot at him, but missed. Then he crouched and returned my fire\nfrom his new angle; but Anita and I had shifted.\n\nTime passed--only a few moments. I could not see Miko momentarily.\nPerhaps he was crouching; perhaps he had moved away again. He was, or\nhad been, on slightly higher ground than the bottom of our bowl. It\nwas dim down here where we were lying, but I feared that every moment\nMiko might appear and strike at us. His ray at any short range would\npenetrate our visor-panes, even though our suits might temporarily\nresist it.\n\n\"Anita--it's too dangerous here.\"\n\nHad I been alone, I might perhaps have leaped up to lure Miko. But\nwith Anita I did not dare chance it.\n\n\"We've got to get back to the camp,\" I told her. The audiphone brought\nher comment:\n\n\"Perhaps he has gone.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut he had not. We saw him again, out in a distant patch of\nEarthlight. He was further from us than before, but on still higher\nground. We had extinguished our small helmet-lights. But he knew we\nwere here, and possibly he could see us. His projector flashed again.\nBut we had again shifted, and were untouched. He was a hundred feet or\nmore away now. His weapon was of longer range than mine. I did not\nanswer his fire, for I could not hope to hit him at such a distance,\nand the flash of my weapon would help him with his aim.\n\nI murmured to Anita, \"We must get out of here.\"\n\nYet how did I dare take Anita from these concealing shadows? Miko\ncould reach us so easily as we bounded away, in plain view in the\nEarthlight of the open summit! We were caught, at bay in this little\nbowl.\n\nThe camp from here was not visible. But out through the broken gully,\nbeyond the staircase top, a white beam of light suddenly came up from\nbelow.\n\n\"_Haljan._\"\n\nIt spelled the signal.\n\n\"_Haljan._\"\n\nIt was coming from the Grantline instrument room, I knew.\n\nI could answer it with my helmet-light, but I did not dare. I\nhesitated.\n\n\"Try it,\" urged Anita.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe crouched where we thought we might be safe from Miko's fire. My\nlittle light-beam shot up from the bowl. It was undoubtedly visible to\nthe camp.\n\n\"_Yes? I am Haljan._\"\n\nAnd I added:\n\n\"_Help! Send us help._\"\n\nI did not mention Anita. Miko could doubtless read these signals. And\nin the camp they must have missed Anita by now. They answered:\n\n\"_Cannot_--\"\n\nI lost the rest of it. There came a flash from Miko's weapon. But it\ngave us confidence. He could not reach us at the moment.\n\nThe Grantline beam repeated:\n\n\"_Cannot come out. Portes broken. You cannot get in. Stay where you\nare--an hour or two. We may be able to repair portes._\"\n\nThe portes were broken! Stay here an hour or two! But I could not hold\nthis position against Miko that long! Sooner or later he would find a\nplace from where he could sweep this bowl beyond possibility of our\nhiding. I saw him running now, well beyond my range, to ferret out\nanother point of vantage.\n\nI extinguished my light. What use was it to tell Grantline anything\nfurther? Besides, my light was dangerous.\n\nBut the Grantline beam spelled another message:\n\n\"_The brigand ship is coming! It will be here before we can get out to\nyou! No lights! We will try and hide our location._\"\n\nAnd the signal-beam brought a last appeal to me:\n\n\"_Miko and his men will divulge where we are. Unless you can stop\nthem_--\"\n\nThe beam vanished. The lights of the Grantline camp made a faint glow\nthat showed above the crater-edge. The glow died, as the camp now was\nplunged into darkness.\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\n_Anita's Plan_\n\nWe crouched in the shadows, the Earthlight filtering down to us. The\nskulking figure of Miko had vanished; but he was out there somewhere\non the crags I was sure, lurking, maneuvering to where he could strike\nus with his ray. Anita's metal-gloved hand was on my arm; in my ear\ndiaphragm her voice sounded eager and unmistakable:\n\n\"What was the signal, Gregg?\"\n\nShe could not read the semaphore lights. I told her.\n\n\"Oh Gregg, the Martian ship coming!\"\n\nHer mind clung to that as the most important thing. But not so myself.\nTo me there was only the realization that Anita was caught out here,\nalmost at the mercy of Miko's ray. Grantline's men could not get out\nto help us, nor could I get Anita into the camp.\n\nShe added, \"Where do you suppose the ship is? In telescopic view?\"\n\n\"Yes--twenty or thirty thousand miles up, probably.\"\n\nThe stars and the Earth were visible over us. Somewhere up there\ndisclosed by Grantline's instrument but not yet discernible to the\nnaked eye, Miko's reinforcements were hovering.\n\nI stood up cautiously to try and locate Miko. Immediately I saw him.\nHe jumped as though fearing my coming bullet, and I dropped back,\nbarely avoiding his flash, which swept across the top of our bowl.\n\n\"Gregg--Gregg, don't take such a chance!\"\n\nWe lay for a moment in silence. It was horribly nerve-straining. Miko\ncould be creeping up on us. Would he dare chance my sudden fire?\nCreeping--or would he make a swift, unexpected rush?\n\nThe feeling that he was upon us abruptly swept me. I jumped to my\nfeet, against Anita's effort to hold me. But again Miko had vanished.\nWhere was he now?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI sank back. \"That ship will be here in a few hours.\"\n\nI told her what Grantline's signal had suggested: the ship was\nhovering overhead. It must be fairly close; for Grantline's telescope\nhad revealed its identity as a bandit flyer, unmarked by any of the\nstandard code-identification lights. It was doubtless too far away as\nyet to have located the whereabouts of Grantline's camp. The Martian\nbrigands knew that we were in the vicinity of Archimedes, but no more\nthan that. Searching this glowing Moon surface, our little lights, the\ntiny local semaphore beams we had momentarily been using, could easily\npass unnoticed.\n\nBut as the brigand ship approached now--dropping close to Archimedes\nas it probably would--our danger was that Miko and his men would then\nsignal it, join it, and reveal the camp's location, and the brigand\nattack would be upon us.\n\nI told this now to Anita. \"The signal said, '_Unless you can stop\nthem_.'\"\n\nIt was an appeal to me. But how could I respond to it? What could I\ndo, alone out here with Anita, to cope with this enemy?\n\nAnita made no comment.\n\nI added, \"That ship will land near Archimedes I imagine, within an\nhour or two! If Grantline can repair his portes, and I can get you\ninside--\"\n\nAgain she made no comment. Then suddenly she gripped me. \"Gregg, look\nthere!\"\n\nOut through the gully break in our bowl the figure of Miko showed! He\nwas running. But not at us. Circling the summit, leaping to keep\nhimself behind the upstanding crags. He passed the head of the\nstaircase; he did not descend it, but headed off along the summit of\nthe curving crater-rim.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI stood up to watch him. He was making off. Abandoning us!\n\n\"He's going!\"\n\nI let her stand up beside me; cautiously, at first, for it occurred to\nme that this might be a ruse to cover some other of Miko's men who\nmight be lurking up here.\n\nBut the summit seemed clear. The figure of Miko was a thousand feet\naway now. We could see the tiny blob of it bobbing over the rocks.\nThen it plunged down--not into the crater-valley, but out toward the\nopen Moon surface.\n\nMiko had abandoned his attack on us. The reason seemed plain. He had\ncome here from his encampment with Coniston, had sent Coniston ahead\nto lure and kill Wilks. When this was done, Coniston had flashed his\nbrief signal to Miko, who was hiding nearby.\n\nIt was not like the brigand leader to remain in the background. Miko\nwas no coward. But Coniston could impersonate Wilks, whereas Miko's\ngiant stature at once would reveal his identity. Miko had been engaged\nin smashing the portes. He had looked up and seen me kill Coniston. He\nhad come up to assail me. And then he had read Grantline's signal to\nme. It was his first knowledge that his ship was at hand. With the\ncamp exits inoperative, Grantline and his men were imprisoned. Miko\nmade an effort to kill me. He did not know my companion was Anita. The\neffort was taking too long: with the Grantline camp imprisoned and his\nship at hand, it was Miko's best move to return to his own camp,\nrejoin his men, and await their opportunity to signal the ship.\n\nAt least, so I reasoned it. Anita and I stood alone. What could we do?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe went to the brink of the cliff. The unlighted Grantline buildings\nshowed vaguely in the Earthlight.\n\nI said, \"We'll go down, I'll leave you there. You can wait at the\nporte. They'll repair it soon, perhaps, and let you in.\"\n\n\"And what will you do?\" she demanded.\n\nI was hurrying her down the stairs. But suddenly she stopped. \"What\nare you going to do, Gregg?\"\n\nI had not intended to tell her. \"Hurry, Anita!\"\n\n\"Why?\" She stood stock still. Through the visors I could see her white\nface gazing at me rebelliously.\n\n\"Why should I hurry, Gregg?\"\n\n\"Because I want to leave you at the porte. I'm going after Miko--try\nand locate where he and his men are camping.\"\n\nI had indeed no specific plan as yet. But it seemed useless for me to\nsit at the porte waiting to be let in.\n\n\"But he's gone, Gregg.\"\n\nShe was right on that. Miko was already a mile or more away, down on\nthe outer surface, making off. He would soon be out of sight. It would\nbe impossible to follow him.\n\n\"Gregg, let me go with you.\"\n\nShe jerked away from me and bounded back up the staircase. I caught\nher on the summit.\n\n\"Anita!\"\n\n\"I'm going with you.\"\n\n\"You're going to stay here.\"\n\n\"I'm not!\"\n\nThis exasperating controversy! And time was so precious!\n\n\"Anita, please.\"\n\n\"I'll be safer with you than waiting here, Gregg.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt almost decided me. Perhaps she would. It was only my intention to\nfollow Miko at a distance. And with much more of this delay here, he\nwould be lost to me.\n\nAnd she added, \"Besides, I won't stay, and you can't make me.\"\n\nWe ran along the crater-top. At its distant edge the lower plain\nspread before us. Far down, and far away on the distant broken\nsurface, the leaping figure of Miko showed.\n\nWe plunged down the broken outer slope, reached the level. Soon, as we\nran, the little Grantline crater faded behind us.\n\nAnita ran more skillfully than I. Ten minutes or so passed. We had seen\nMiko, and the direction he was taking, but down here on the plain we\ncould no longer see him. It struck me that this was purposeless--and\ndangerous. Suppose Miko were to see us following? Suppose he stopped and\nlay in ambush to fire at us as we came leaping heedlessly by?\n\n\"Anita, wait,\" I said, checking her.\n\nI drew her down amid a group of tumbled boulders. And then abruptly\nshe clung to me.\n\n\"Gregg, I know what we can do! Gregg, don't tell me you won't let me\ntry it!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI listened to her plan. Incredible! Incredibly dangerous! Yet, as I\npondered it, the very daring of the thing seemed the measure of its\npossible success. The brigands would never imagine we could be so\nrash!\n\n\"But Anita--\"\n\n\"Gregg, you're stupid!\" It was her turn to be exasperated. In truth, I\nwas indeed in no mood for daring, for my mind was obsessed with\nAnita's safety. I had been planning that we might see the glow of\nMiko's encampment, and then return to Grantline and hope that he would\nhave the portes repaired.\n\n\"But Gregg--the safety of the treasure--of all the Grantline men....\"\n\n\"To the infernal with that! It's you--your safety.\"\n\n\"My safety, then! If you put me in the camp and the brigands attack it\nand I am killed--what then? But this plan of mine, if we can do it,\nGregg ... safety, in the end, for all of us.\"\n\nAnd it seemed possible. We crouched, discussing it. So daring a thing!\n\nThe brigand ship would come down near Archimedes. That was fifty miles\nfrom Grantline. The brigands from Mars would not have seen the dark\nGrantline buildings hidden in the little crater-pit. They would wait\nfor Miko and his men to make their whereabouts known.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMiko's encampment was ahead of us now, undoubtedly. We had been\nfollowing him toward the Mare Imbrium; we were at its borders now.\nArchimedes from here was also about fifty miles.\n\nAnd Anita proposed that we go to Archimedes, climb in slope and await\nthe coming of the brigand ship. Miko would be off in the Mare Imbrium.\nOr at least, we hoped so. He would signal his ship. But Anita and I,\ncloser to it, would also signal it--and, posing as brigands, could\njoin it!\n\n\"Remember, Gregg, I am Anita Prince, George's sister.\" Her voice\ntrembled as, she mentioned her dead brother. \"They know that George\nwas in Miko's pay, and I am his sister.... It will help convince\nthem.\"\n\nThis daring scheme! If we could join the ship, we might be able to\npersuade its leader that Miko's distant signals were merely a ruse of\nGrantline to lure the brigands in that direction. A long-range\nprojector from the ship would kill Miko and his men as they came\nforward to join it! And then we could falsely direct the brigands,\nlead them away from Grantline and the treasure.\n\n\"Gregg, we must try it.\"\n\nHeaven help me, I yielded to her persuasion!\n\nWe turned at right angles and ran toward where the distant frowning\nwalls of Archimedes loomed against the starlit sky.\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\n_The Ascent of Archimedes_\n\nThe broken shaggy ramparts of the giant crater rose above us. We\ntoiled upward, out of the foothills, clinging now to the crags and\npitted terraces of the main ascent. An hour had passed since we turned\nfrom the borders of the Mare Imbrium. Or was it two hours? I could not\ntell. I only know that we ran with desperate frantic haste.\n\nAnita would not admit that she was tired. She was more skilful than I\nin this leaping over the broken rock masses. Yet I felt that her\nslight strength must give out. It seemed miles up the undulating\nslopes of the foothills with the black and white ramparts of the\nmassive crater close before us.\n\nAnd then the main ascent. There were places where, like smooth black\nfrozen ice, the walls rose sheer. We avoided them, toiling aside,\nplunging into gullies, crossing pits where sometimes we perforce went\ndownwards, and then up again; or sometimes we stood, hot and\nbreathless, upon ledges, recovering our strength, selecting the best\nroute upward.\n\nThis tumbled mass of rock! Honeycombed everywhere with caves and\npassages leading into darkness impenetrable. There were pits into\nwhich we might so easily have fallen; ravines to span, sometimes with\na leap, sometimes by a long and arduous detour.\n\nEndless climb! We came to a ledge, with the plains of the Mare Imbrium\nstretching out beneath us. We might have been upon this main ascent\nfor an hour; the plains were far down, the broken surface down there\nsmoothed now by the perspective of our height. And yet still above us\nthe brooding circular wall went up into the sky. Ten thousand feet\nstill above us--I think it was at least that, or more.\n\n\"You're tired, Anita. We'd better stay here.\"\n\n\"No! If we could only get to the top--the ship may land on the other\nside--they would see us if we were at the top.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was as yet no sign of the brigand ship. With every stop for rest\nwe searched the starry vault. The Earth hung over us, flattened beyond\nthe full. The stars blazed to mingle with the Earthlight and illumine\nthese massive crags of the Archimedes walls. But no speck appeared to\ntell us that the ship was up there.\n\nWe were on the curving side of the Archimedes wall which fronted the\nMare Imbrium to the North. The plains lay like a great frozen sea,\ncongealed ripples shining in the light of the Earth, with dark\npatches to mark the hollows. Somewhere down there--six or eight\nthousand feet below us now, or even more than that, for all I could\ntell--Miko's encampment lay concealed. We searched for lights of it,\nbut could see none.\n\nOr had Miko rejoined his party, left his camp and come here like\nourselves to climb Archimedes? Or was our assumption wholly\nwrong--perhaps the brigand ship would not land near here at all?\n\nSweeping around from the Mare Imbrium, the plains were less\nsmooth--the shattered, crag-littered, crater-scarred region beyond\nwhich the distant Apennines raised their terraced walls. The little\ncrater which concealed the Grantline camp was off that way. There was\nnothing to mark it from here.\n\n\"Gregg, do you see anything up there? There seems to be a blur.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHer sight, sharper than mine, had picked it out. The descending\nbrigand ship! A faintest tiny blur against the stars, a few of them\nocculted as though strangely an invisible shadow were upon them. A\ngrowing shadow, materializing into a blur--a blob, a shape faintly\ndefined. Then sharper until we were sure of what we saw. It was the\nbrigand ship. It came dropping slowly, silently down.\n\nWe crouched on the little ledge. A cave-mouth was behind us. A gully\nwas beside us, a break in the ledge; and at our feet the wall dropped\nsheer.\n\nWe had extinguished our little lights. We crouched, silently gazing up\ninto the stars.\n\nThe ship, when first we distinguished it was central over Archimedes.\nWe thought for a while that it might descend into the crater. But it\ndid not; it came sailing forward.\n\nI whispered into the audiphone--whispering by instinct, as though out\nhere in all this airless desolation someone might overhear us!\n\n\"It's coming over the crater.\"\n\nHer hand pressed my arm in answer.\n\nI recalled that when, from the _Planetara_, Miko had forced Snap to\nsignal this brigand band on Mars, Miko's only information as to the\nwhereabouts of the Grantline camp was that it lay between Archimedes\nand the Apennines. That was Grantline's first message to us, and Miko\nhad relayed it to his men. The brigands from Mars now were following\nthat information.\n\nA tense interval passed. We could see the ship plainly above us now, a\ngray-black shape among the stars up beyond the shaggy, towering\ncrater-rim. The vessel came upon a level keel, hull-down, slowly\ncircling, looking for Miko's signal, no doubt, or for possible lights\nof Grantline. They were also picking a landing place.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe saw it soon as a cylindrical, cigarlike shape, rather smaller than\nthe _Planetara_, but similar of design. It bore lights now. The ports\nof its hull were tiny rows of illumination, and the glow of light\nunder its rounding upper dome was faintly visible.\n\nA bandit ship, no doubt of that. Its identification keel-plate was\nempty of official pass-code lights. These brigands had not attempted\nto secure official sailing lights when leaving Ferrok-Shahn. It was an\noutlawed ship, unmistakably. And here upon the deserted Moon there was\nno need for secrecy. Its lights were openly displayed, that Miko might\nsee it and join it.\n\nIt went slowly past us, only a few thousand feet higher than our\nlevel. We could see the whole outline of its pointed cylinder-hull,\nwith the rounded dome on top. And under the dome was its open\ndeck-space, with a little cabin superstructure in the center.\n\nI thought for a moment that by some fortunate chance it might land\nquite near us. There was a wide ledge a quarter of a mile away.\n\n\"Anita, look.\"\n\nBut it went past. And then I saw that it was heading for a level,\nplateau-like surface a few miles further on. It dropped, cautiously\nfloating down.\n\nThere was still no sign of Miko. But I realized that haste was\nnecessary. We must be the first to join the brigand ship.\n\nI lifted Anita to her feet. \"I don't think we should signal from\nhere.\"\n\n\"No. Miko might see it.\"\n\nWe could not tell where he was. Down on the plains, perhaps? Or up\nhere, somewhere in these miles of towering rocks?\n\n\"Are you ready, Anita?\"\n\n\"Yes, Gregg.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI stared through the visors at her white, solemn face.\n\n\"Yes, I'm ready,\" she repeated.\n\nHer hand-pressure seemed to me suddenly like a farewell. Were we\nplunging rashly into what was destined to mean our death? Was this a\nfarewell?\n\nAn instinct swept me not to do this thing. Why, in an hour or two I\ncould have Anita back to the comparative safety of the Grantline\nbuildings. The exit portes would doubtless be repaired by now. I could\nget her inside.\n\nShe had bounded away from me, leaped down some thirty feet into the\nbroken gully, to cross it and then up on the other side. I stood for\nan instant watching her fantastic shape, with the great rounded,\ngoggled, trunked helmet and the lump on her shoulders which held the\nlittle Erentz motors. Then I made after her.\n\nIt did not take us long--two or three miles of circling along the\ngiant wall. The ship lay only a few hundred feet above our level.\n\nWe stood at last on a buttelike pinnacle. The hull-porte lights of the\nship were close over us. And there were moving lights up there, tiny\nmoving spots on the adjacent rocks. The brigands had come out,\nprowling around to investigate their location.\n\nNo signal yet from Miko. But it might come at any moment.\n\n\"I'll flash now,\" I whispered.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nThe brigands had probably not yet seen us. I took the lamp from my\nhelmet. My hand was trembling. Suppose my signal were answered by a\nshot? A flash from some giant projector mounted on the ship?\n\nAnita crouched behind a rock, as she had promised. I stood with my\ntorch, and flung its switch.\n\nMy puny light-beam shot up. I waved it, touched the ship with its\nfaint glowing circle of illumination.\n\nThey saw me. There was a sudden movement among the lights up there.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI semaphored:\n\n\"_I am from Miko. Do not fire._\"\n\nI used the open Universal Code. In Martian first, and then in English.\n\nThere was no answer, but no attack. I tried again.\n\n\"_This is Haljan, once of the_ Planetara. _George Prince's sister is\nwith me. There has been disaster to Miko._\"\n\nA small light-beam came down from the brink of the overhead cliff\nbeside the ship.\n\n\"_We read you._\"\n\nI went steadily on: \"_Disaster--the_ Planetara _is wrecked. All killed\nbut me and George Prince's sister. We want to join you._\"\n\nI flashed off my light. The answer came: \"_Where is the Grantline\ncamp?_\"\n\n\"_Near here. The Mare Imbrium._\"\n\nAs though to answer my lie, from down on the Earthlit plains, ten\nmiles or so from the crater-base, a tiny signal-light shot up. Anita\nsaw it and gripped me.\n\n\"There is Miko's light!\"\n\nIt spelled in Martian, \"_Come down. Land Mare Imbrium._\"\n\nMiko had seen the signalling up here and was joining it! He repeated,\n\"_Land Mare Imbrium._\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI flashed a protest up to the ship: \"_Beware! That is Grantline!\nTrickery!_\"\n\nFrom the ship the summons came: \"_Come up._\"\n\nWe had won this first encounter! Miko must have realized his\ndisadvantage. His distant light went out.\n\n\"Come, Anita.\"\n\nThere was no retreat now. But again I seemed to feel in the pressure\nof her hand that vague farewell.\n\nHer voice whispered, \"We must do our best, act our best to be\nconvincing.\"\n\nIn the white glow of a search-beam we climbed the crags, reached the\nbroad upper ledge. Helmeted figures rushed at us, searched us for\nweapons, seized our helmet lights. The evil face of a giant Martian\npeered at me through the visors. Two other monstrous, towering figures\nseized Anita.\n\nWe were shoved toward the port-locks at the base of the ship's hull.\nAbove the hull bulge I could see the grids of projectors mounted in\nthe dome-side, and the figures of men standing on the deck, peering\ndown at us.\n\nWe went through the admission locks into a hull corridor, up an\nincline passage, and reached the lighted deck. Our helmets were taken\noff. The Martian brigands crowded around us.\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\n_On the Brigand Ship_\n\nAnita's words echoed in my memory: \"We must act our best to be\nconvincing.\" It was not her ability that I doubted as much as my own.\nShe had played the part of George Prince cleverly, unmasked only by an\nevil chance.\n\nI steeled myself to face the searching glances of the brigands as they\nshoved around us. This was a desperate game into which we had plunged!\nFor all our acting, how easy it would be for some small chance thing\nabruptly to undo us! I realized it, and now, as I gazed into the\npeering faces of these men from Mars, I cursed my witless rashness\nwhich had brought Anita into this!\n\nThe brigands--some ten or fifteen of them here on the deck--stood in a\nring around us. They were all big men, nearly of a seven-foot\naverage, dressed in leather jerkins and short leather breeches, with\nbare knees and flaring leatherboots. Piratical swaggering fellows,\nknife-blades mingled with small hand-projectors fastened to their\nbelts. Gray, heavy faces, some with scraggling, unshaved beard. They\nplucked at us, jabbering in Martian.\n\nOne of them seemed the leader. I said sharply, \"Are you the commander\nhere? I speak not Ilton[4] well. You speak the Earth English?\"\n\n[Footnote 4: Ilton, the ruling race and official language of the\nMartian Union.]\n\n\"Yes,\" he said readily, \"I am Commander here.\" He spoke English with\nthe same freedom and accent of Miko. \"Is this George Prince's sister?\"\n\n\"Yes. Her name is Anita Prince. Tell your men to take their hands off\nher.\"\n\nHe waved his men away. They all seemed more interested in Anita than\nin me. He added:\n\n\"I am Set Potan.\" He addressed Anita. \"George Prince's sister? You are\ncalled Anita? I have heard of you. I knew your brother--indeed, you\nlook very much like him.\"\n\nHe swept his plumed hat to the grid with a swaggering gesture of\nhomage. A courtierlike fellow this, debonair as a Venus cavalier!\n\nHe accepted us. I realized that Anita's presence was immensely\nvaluable in making us convincing. Yet there was about this Potan--as\nwith Miko--a disturbing suggestion of irony. I could not make him out.\nI decided that we had fooled him. Then I remarked the steely glitter\nof his eyes as he turned to me.\n\n\"You were an officer of the _Planetara_?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe insignia of my rank was visible on my white jacket-collar which\nshowed beneath the Erentz suit, now that my helmet was off.\n\n\"Yes, I was supposed to be. But a year ago I embarked upon this\nadventure with Miko.\"\n\nHe was leading us to his cabin. \"The _Planetara_ wrecked? Miko dead?\"\n\n\"And Hahn and Coniston. George Prince, too--we are the only\nsurvivors.\"\n\nWhile we divested ourselves of our Erentz suits at his command, I told\nhim briefly of the _Planetara's_ fall. All had been killed on board\nsave Anita and me. We had escaped, awaited his coming. The treasure\nwas here; we had located the Grantline camp, and were ready to lead\nhim to it.\n\nDid he believe me? He listened quietly. He seemed not shocked at the\ndeath of his comrades. Nor yet pleased: merely imperturbable.\n\nI added with a sly, sidelong glance, \"There were too many of us on the\n_Planetara_. The purser had joined us, and many of the crew. And there\nwas Miko's sister, the Setta Moa--too many. The treasure divides\nbetter among less.\"\n\nAn amused smile played on his thin gray lips. But he nodded. The fear\nwhich had leaped in me was allayed by his next words.\n\n\"True enough, Haljan. He was a domineering fellow, Miko. A third of it\nall was for him alone. But now....\"\n\nThe third would go to this sub-leader, Potan! The implication was\nobvious.\n\nI said, \"Before we go any further--I can trust you for my share?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI figured that my very boldness in bargaining so prematurely would\nconvince him. I insisted, \"And Miss Prince? She will have her\nbrother's share?\"\n\nClever Anita! She put in swiftly, \"I give no information until you\npromise! We know the location of the Grantline camp, its weapons, its\ndefense, the amount and location of the ore. I warn you, if you do not\nplay us fair....\"\n\nHe laughed heartily. He seemed to like us. He spread his huge legs as\nhe lounged in his settle, and drank of the bowl which one of his men\nset before him.\n\n\"Little tigress! Fear me not--I play fair!\" He pushed two of the bowls\nacross the table. \"Drink, Haljan. All is well with us, and I am glad\nto hear it. Miss Prince, drink my health as your leader.\"\n\nI waved it away from Anita. \"We need all our wits; your strong Martian\ndrinks are dangerous. Look here, I'll tell you just how the situation\nstands--\"\n\nI plunged into a glib account of our supposed wanderings to find the\nGrantline camp; its location off in the Mare Imbrium--hidden in a\ncavern there. Potan, with the drink, and under the gaze of Anita's\neyes, was in a high good humor. He laughed when I told him that we had\ndared to invade the Grantline camp, had smashed its exit portes, had\neven gotten up to have a look at where the ore was piled.\n\n\"Well done, Haljan! You're a fellow to my liking!\" But his gaze was on\nAnita. \"You dress like a man, or a charming boy.\"\n\nShe still wore the dark clothes of her brother. She said, \"I am used\nto action--man's garb pleases me. You shall treat me like a man, give\nme my share of the gold-leaf.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe had already demanded of us the meaning of that signal from the Mare\nImbrium. Miko's signal! It had not come again, though any moment I\nfeared it. I told him that Grantline had doubtless repaired his\ndamaged portes and sallied out to assail me in reprisal. And seeing\nthe brigand ship landing on Archimedes, had tried to lure it.\n\nI wondered if my explanation were very convincing. It did not sound\nso. But he was flushed now with the drink. And Anita added:\n\n\"Grantline knows the territory near his camp very well. He is equipped\nonly for short-range fighting.\"\n\nI took it up. \"It's like this, Potan: if he could get you to land\nunsuspectingly near the mouth of his cavern....\"\n\nI pictured how Grantline might have figured on a sudden surprise\nattack upon the ship. It was his only chance to catch it unprepared.\n\nWe were all three in friendly, intimate mood now. Potan said, \"We'll\nland down there right enough! But I need a few hours for my\nassembling.\"\n\n\"He will not dare advance,\" I said. \"For one thing, he can't leave the\ntreasure.\"\n\n\"He knows we have unmasked his lure,\" Anita put in smilingly. \"Haljan\nand I joining you--that silenced him. His light went out very\npromptly, didn't it?\"\n\nShe flashed me a side-gaze. Were we acting convincingly? But if Miko\nstarted up his signals again, they might so quickly betray us! Anita's\nthoughts were upon that, for she added:\n\n\"Grantline will not dare show his light! If he does, Set Potan, we can\nblast him with a ray from here! Can't we?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Potan agreed. \"If he comes within ten miles, I have one\npowerful enough. We are assembling it now.\"\n\n\"And we have thirty men?\" Anita persisted. \"When we sail down to\nattack him it should not be very difficult to kill all the Grantline\nparty. Thirty of us--that's enough to share in this treasure. I'm glad\nMiko is dead.\"\n\n\"By Heaven, Haljan, this girl of yours is small, but very\nblood-thirsty!\"\n\n\"That accursed Miko murdered her brother,\" I explained.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nActing! And never once did we dare relax! If only Miko's signals would\nhold off and give us time!\n\nWe may have talked for half an hour. We were in a small, steel-lined\ncubby, located in the forward deck-space of the ship. The dome was\nover it. I could see from where I sat at the table that there was a\nforward observatory tower under the dome quite near here. The ship was\nlaid out in rather similar fashion to the _Planetara_, though\nconsiderably smaller.\n\nPotan had dismissed his men from his cubby so as to be alone with us.\nOut on the deck I could see them dragging apparatus about--bringing\nthe mechanisms of giant projectors up from below, beginning to\nassemble them. Occasionally some of the men would come to our cubby\nwindows to peer in at us curiously.\n\nMy mind was roaming as I talked. For all my manner of casualness, I\nknew that haste was necessary. Whatever Anita and I were to do must be\nquickly done. But to win this fellow's utter confidence first was\nnecessary, so that we might have the freedom of the ship, might move\nabout unnoticed, unwatched.\n\nI was horribly tense inside. Through the dome windows across the deck\nfrom the cubby the rocks of the Lunar landscape were visible. I could\nsee the brink of this ledge upon which the ship lay, the descending\ncrags down the precipitous wall of Archimedes to the Earthlit plains\nfar below. Miko, Moa, and a few of the _Planetara's_ crew were down\nthere somewhere.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnita and I had a fairly definite plan. We were now in Potan's\nconfidence. With this interview at an end, I felt that our status\namong the brigands would be established. We would be free to move\nabout the ship, join in its activities. It ought to be possible to\nlocate the signal-room, get friendly with the operator there.\n\nPerhaps we would find a secret opportunity to flash a signal to Earth.\nThis ship, I was confident, would have the power for a long-range\nsignal, if not of too sustained a length. It was a desperate thing to\nattempt but our whole procedure was desperate! And I felt--if Anita\nperhaps could cajole the guard or the duty-man from the signal-room--I\nmight send a single flash or two that would reach the Earth. Just a\ndistress call, signed \"Grantline.\" If I could do that and not get\ncaught.\n\nAnita was engaging Potan in talking of his plans. The brigand leader\nwas boasting of his well-equipped ship, the daring of his men, and\nquestioning her about the size of the treasure. My thoughts were free\nto roam.\n\nA signal to Earth. And while we were making friends with these\nbrigands, the longest range electronic projector was being assembled.\nMiko then could flash his signal and be damned to him! I would be on\nthe deck with that projector. Its operator, and I would turn it upon\nMiko--one flash of it and he and his little band would be wiped out.\n\nBut there was our escape to be thought of. We could not remain very\nlong with these brigands. We could tell them that the Grantline camp\nwas on the Mare Imbrium. It would delay them for a time, but our lie\nwould soon be discovered. We must escape from them, get away and back\nto Grantline. With Miko dead--a distress signal to Earth--and Potan in\nignorance of Grantline's location, the treasure would be safe until\nhelp arrived from Earth.\n\nIt all fitted together so nicely! It seemed possible of success.\n\nOur futile plans! Star-crossed always, doomed, fated always to be\nupset by such unforeseen evil chances!\n\n\"By the infernal, little Anita, you look like a dove, but you're a\ntigress! A comrade after my own heart--blood-thirsty as a\nfire-worshipper!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHer laugh rang out to mingle with his. \"Oh no, Set Potan! I am\ntreasure-thirsty.\"\n\n\"We'll get the treasure, never fear, little Anita.\"\n\n\"With you to lead us, Potan, I'm sure we will.\"\n\nA man entered the cubby. Potan looked frowningly around. \"What is it,\nArgle?\"\n\nThe fellow answered in Martian, leered at Anita and withdrew.\n\nPotan stood up. I noticed that he was unsteady with the drink.\n\n\"They want me with the work at the projectors.\"\n\n\"Go ahead,\" I said.\n\nHe nodded. We were comrades now.\n\n\"Amuse yourself, Haljan. Or come out on deck if you wish. I will tell\nmy men you are one of us.\"\n\n\"And tell them to keep their hands off Miss Prince.\"\n\nHe stared at me. \"I had not thought of that--a woman among so many\nmen.\"\n\nHis own gaze at Anita was as leeringly offensive as any of his men\ncould have given. He said, \"Have no fear, little tigress.\"\n\nAnita laughed. \"I am afraid of nothing.\"\n\nBut when he had lurched from the cabin she touched me. Smiled with her\nmannish swagger, for fear we were still observed, and murmured:\n\n\"Oh, Gregg, I am afraid!\"\n\nWe stayed in the cubby a few moments, whispering--trying to plan.\n\n\"You think the signal room is in the tower, Gregg? This tower outside\nour window here?\"\n\n\"Yes, I think so.\"\n\n\"Shall we go out and see?\"\n\n\"Yes. Keep near me always.\"\n\n\"Oh, Gregg. I will!\"\n\nWe deposited our Erentz suits carefully in a corner of the cubby. We\nmight need them so suddenly! Then we swaggered out to join the\nbrigands working on the deck.\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\n_Desperate Plans_\n\nThe deck glowed lurid in the queer blue-greenish glare of Martian\nelectro-fuse lights. It was in a bustle of ordered activity. Some\ntwenty of the crew were scattered about, working in little groups.\nApparatus was being brought up from below to be assembled. There was a\npile of Erentz suits and helmets, of Martian pattern, but still very\nsimilar to those with which Grantline's expedition was equipped. There\nwere giant projectors of several kinds, some familiar to me, others\nof a fashion I had never seen before. It seemed there were six or\neight of them, still dismantled, with a litter of their attendant\nbatteries and coils and tube-amplifiers. They were to be mounted here\non the deck, I surmised; I saw in the dome-side one or two of them\nalready rolled into position at the necessary pressure portes.\n\nAnita and I stood outside Potan's cubby, gazing around us curiously.\nThe men looked at us, but none of them spoke.\n\n\"Let's watch from here a moment,\" I whispered. She nodded, standing\nwith her hand on my arm. I felt that we were very small, here in the\nmidst of these seven-foot Martian men. I was all in white, the costume\nused in the warm interior of the Grantline camp. Bareheaded, white\nsilk _Planetara_ uniform jacket, broad belt and tight-laced trousers.\nAnita was a slim black figure beside me, somber as Hamlet, with her\npale boyish face and wavy black hair.\n\nThe gravity being maintained here on the ship we had found to be\nstronger than that of the Moon--rather more like Mars.\n\n\"There are the heat-rays, Gregg.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA pile of them was visible down the deck-length. And I saw caskets of\nfragile glass globes, bombs of different styles; hand-projectors of\nthe paralyzing ray; search-beams of several varieties; the Benson\ncurve-light, and a few side-arms of ancient Earth-design--swords and\ndirks, and small bullet projectors.\n\nThere seemed to be some mining equipment also. Far along the deck,\nbeyond the central cabin in the open space of the stern, steel rails\nwere stacked; half a dozen small-wheeled ore-carts; a tiny motor\nengine for hauling them--and what looked as though it might be the\ndismembered sections of an ore-shute.\n\nThe whole deck was presently strewn with this mass of equipment.\n\nPotan moved about, directing the different groups of workers. The\nnews had spread that we knew the location of the treasure. The\nbrigands were jubilant. In a few hours the ship's armament would be\nready, and it would advance to attack Grantline.\n\nI saw many glances being cast out the dome side-windows toward the\ndistant, far-down plains of the Mare Imbrium. The brigands believed\nthat the Grantline camp lay in that direction.\n\nAnita whispered, \"Which is their giant electronic projector, Gregg?\"\n\nI could see it amidships of the deck. It was already in place. Potan\nwas there now, superintending the men who were connecting it. The most\npowerful weapon on the ship, it had, Potan said, an effective range of\nsome ten miles. I wondered what it would do to a Grantline building!\nThe Erentz double walls would withstand it for a time, I was sure. But\nit would blast an Erentz fabric-suit, no doubt of that. Like a\nlightning bolt, it would kill--its flashing free-stream of electrons\nshocking the heart, bringing instant death.\n\nI whispered, \"We must smash that before we leave! But first turn it on\nMiko, if he signals now.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI was tensely watchful for that signal. The electronic projector\nobviously was not yet ready. But when it was connected, I must be near\nit, to persuade its duty-man to fire it on Miko. With this done we\nwould have more time to plan our other tasks. I did not think Potan\nwould be ready for his attack before another time of sleep here in the\nship's routine. Things would be quieter then--I would watch my chance\nto send a signal to Earth, and then we would escape.\n\nWith my thoughts roving, we had been standing quietly at the cubby\ndoor-oval for perhaps fifteen minutes. My hand in my side pouch\nclutched the little bullet projector. The brigands had taken it from\nme and given it to Potan. He had placed it on the settle with my\nErentz suit; and when we gained his confidence he had forgotten it\nand left it there. I had it now, and the feel of its cool sleek handle\ngave me a measure of comfort. Things could go wrong so easily--but if\nthey did, I was determined to sell my life as dearly as possible. And\na vague thought was in my mind: I must not use the last bullet. That\nwould be for Anita.\n\nI shook myself free from such sinister fancy.\n\n\"That electronic projector is remote-controlled. Look, Anita--that's\nthe signal room over us. The giant projector will be aimed and fired\nfrom up there.\"\n\nIt seemed so. A thirty-foot skeleton tower stood on the deck near us,\nwith a spiral ladder leading up to a small square steel cubby at the\ntop. Through the cubby window-ovals I could see instrument panels. A\nsingle Martian was up there; he had called down to Potan concerning\nthe electronic projector.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe roof of this little tower room was close under the dome--a space\nof no more than four feet. A pressure lock-exit in the dome was up\nthere, with a few steps leading up to it from the roof of the tower\nsignal-room. We could escape that way, perhaps. In the event of dire\nnecessity it might be possible. But only as a desperate resort, for it\nwould put us on the top of the glassite dome, with a sheer hundred\nfeet or more down its sleek bulging exterior side, and down the\noutside bulge of the ship's hull, to the rocks below. There might be a\nspider ladder outside leading downward, but I saw no evidence of it.\nIf Anita and I were forced to escape that way, I wondered how we could\nmanage a hundred foot jump to the rocks and land safely. Even with the\nslight gravity of the Moon it would be a dangerous fall.\n\n\"You are Gregg Haljan?\"\n\nI started as one of the brigands, coming up behind us, addressed me.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Commander Potan tells me you were chief navigator of the\n_Planetara_?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You shall pilot us when we advance upon the Grantline camp. I am\ncontrol-commander here--Brotow, my name.\"\n\nHe smiled. A giant fellow, but spindly. He spoke good English. He\nseemed anxious to be friendly.\n\n\"We are glad to have you and George Prince's sister with us.\" He shot\nAnita an admiring glance. \"I will show you our controls, Haljan.\"\n\n\"All right,\" I said. \"Whatever I can do to help....\"\n\n\"But not now. It will be some hours before we are ready.\"\n\nI nodded, and he wandered away. Anita whispered:\n\n\"Did he mean that signal room up here in the tower? Oh, Gregg, maybe\nit's only the ship's control room!\"\n\n\"I don't know. But the projector range-finders are up there, and I\nthink it's the signal room.\"\n\n\"Suppose we go up and see? Gregg, Miko's signals might start any\nminute.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd the electronic projector now seemed about ready. It was time for\nme to act. But a reluctant instinct was upon me. Our Erentz suits were\nhere close behind us in Potan's cubby. I hated to leave them: if\nanything happened and we had to make a sudden dash, there would be no\ntime to garb ourselves in the suits. To adjust the helmets was bad\nenough.\n\nI whispered swiftly, \"We must get into our suits--find some pretext.\"\nI drew her back through the cubby doorway where we would be more\nsecluded.\n\n\"Anita, listen: I've been a fool not to plan our escape more\ncarefully! We're in too great a danger here.\"\n\nIt seemed to me suddenly that we were in desperate plight. Was it\npremonition?\n\n\"Anita, listen: if anything happens and we have to make a dash--\"\n\n\"Up through that dome-lock, Gregg? It's a manual control; you can see\nthe levers.\"\n\n\"Yes. It's a manual. But up there--how would we get down?\"\n\nShe was far calmer than I. \"There may be an outside ladder, Gregg.\"\n\n\"I don't think so. I haven't seen it.\"\n\n\"Then we can get out the way they brought us in. The hull-porte--it's\na manual, too.\"\n\n\"Yes, I think I can find our way down through the hull corridors. I\nmean, for a quick run. If we have to run, you stay close behind me.\nI've this bullet projector, and evidently there aren't many men in the\nlower corridors.\"\n\n\"There are guards outside on the rocks.\"\n\nWe had seen them through the dome windows. But there were not\nmany--only two or three. A surprise rush at them would turn the trick.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe donned our Erentz suits.\n\n\"What will we do with the helmets?\" Anita demanded. \"Leave them here?\"\n\n\"No--take them with us. I'm not going to get separated from them; it's\ntoo dangerous.\"\n\n\"We'll look strange going up to that signal room equipped like this,\"\nshe commented.\n\n\"I can't help it. We'll figure out something to explain it.\"\n\nShe stood before me, a queer-looking little figure in the now\ndeflated, bagging suit with her slim neck and head protruding above\nthe metal circle of its collar.\n\n\"Carry your helmet, Anita. I'll take mine.\"\n\nWe could adjust the helmets and start the Erentz motors all within a\nfew seconds.\n\n\"I'm ready, Gregg.\"\n\n\"Come on, then. Let me go first.\"\n\nI had the bullet projector in an outer pouch of the suit where I could\ninstantly reach it. This was more rational: we had a fighting chance\nnow. The fear which had swept me so suddenly began to recede. I was\ncalm.\n\n\"We'll climb the tower to the signal room,\" I whispered. \"Do it\nboldly.\"\n\nWe stepped from the cubby. Potan was not in sight; he was on the\nfurther deck beyond the central cabin structure perhaps, or had gone\nbelow.\n\nOn the deck, we were immediately accosted. This was different--our\nappearance in the Erentz suits!\n\n\"Where are you going?\"\n\nThis fellow spoke in Martian. I answered in English.\n\n\"Up there.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe stood before us, towering over me. I saw a group of nearby workers\nstop to regard us. In a moment we would be causing a commotion, and it\nwas the last thing I desired.\n\nI said in Martian, \"Commander Potan told me, what I wish I can do.\nFrom the dome we look around--see where is the Grantline camp--I am\npilot of this ship to go there.\"\n\nThe man who had called himself Brotow passed near us. I appealed to\nhim.\n\n\"We put on our suits. I thought we might go up on the dome for a\nminute and look around. If I'm to pilot the ship....\"\n\nHe hesitated, his glance sweeping the deck as though to ask Potan.\nSomeone said in Martian:\n\n\"The commander is down in the stern storeroom.\"\n\nIt decided Brotow. He waved away the Martian who had stopped me.\n\n\"Let them alone.\"\n\nAnita and I gave him our most friendly smiles.\n\n\"Thanks.\"\n\nHe bowed to Anita with a sweeping gesture. \"I will show you over the\ncontrol room presently.\"\n\nHis gaze went to the peak of the bow. The little hooded cubby there\nwas the control room. Satisfaction swept me. Then this, above us in\nthe tower, must surely be the signal room. Would Brotow follow us up?\nI hoped not. I wanted to be alone with the duty-man up there, giving\nme a chance to get at the projector controls if Miko's signal should\ncome.\n\nI drew Anita past Brotow, who had stood aside. \"Thanks,\" I repeated.\n\"We won't be long.\"\n\nWe mounted the little ladder.\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\n_In the Tower Cubby_\n\n\"Hurry, Anita!\"\n\nI feared that Potan might come up from the hull at any moment and stop\nus. The duty-man over us gazed down, his huge head and shoulders\nblocking the small signal room window. Brotow called up in Martian,\ntelling him to let us come. He scowled, but when we reached the trap\nin the room floor-grid, we found him standing aside to admit us.\n\nI flung a swift glance around. It was a metallic cubby, not much over\nfifteen feet square, with an eight-foot arched ceiling. There were\ninstrument panels. The range-finder for the giant projector was here;\nits little telescope with the trajectory apparatus and the firing\nswitch were unmistakable. And the signalling apparatus was here! Not a\nMartian set, but a fully powerful Botz ultra-violet helio sender with\nits attendant receiving mirrors. The _Planetara_ had used the Botz\nsystem, so I was thoroughly familiar with it. I saw, too, what seemed\nto be weapons: a row of small fragile glass globes, hanging on clips\nalong the wall--bombs, each the size of a man's fist. And a broad belt\nwith bombs in its padded compartments.\n\nMy heart was pounding as my first quick glance took in these details.\nI saw also that the room had four small oval window openings. They\nwere breast-high above the floor; from the deck below I knew that the\nangle of vision was such that the men down there could not see into\nthis room except to glimpse its upper portion near the ceiling. And\nthe helio set was banked on a low table near the floor.\n\nIn a corner of the room a small ladder led through a ceiling trap to\nthe cubby roof. This upper trap was open. Four feet above the\nroom-roof was the arch of the dome, with the entrance to the upper\nexit-lock directly above us. The weapons and the belt of bombs were\nnear this ascending ladder, evidently placed here as equipment for use\nfrom the top of the dome.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI turned to the solitary duty-man. I must gain his confidence at once.\nAnita had laid her helmet aside. She spoke first.\n\n\"We were with Set Miko,\" she said smilingly, \"in the wreck of the\n_Planetara_. You heard of it? We know where the treasure is.\"\n\nThis duty-man was a full seven feet tall, and the most heavy-set\nMartian I had ever seen. A tremendous, beetling-browed, scowling\nfellow. He stood with hands on his hips, his leather-garbed legs\nspread wide; and as I fronted him I felt like a child. He was silent,\nglaring down at me as I drew his attention from Anita.\n\n\"You speak English? We are not skilled with Martian.\"\n\nI wondered if at the next time of sleep this fellow would be on duty\nhere. I hoped not; it would not be easy to trick him and find an\nopportunity to flash a signal. But that task was some hours away as\nyet; I would worry about it when the time came. Just now I was\nconcerned with Miko and his little band, who at any moment might\narrive in sight. If we could persuade this scowling duty-man to turn\nthe projector on them....\n\nHe answered me in ready English:\n\n\"You are the man Gregg Haljan? And this is the sister of George\nPrince--what do you want up here?\"\n\n\"I am a navigator. Brotow wants me to pilot the ship when we advance\nto attack Grantline.\"\n\n\"This is not the control room.\"\n\n\"No, I know it isn't.\"\n\nI put my helmet carefully on the floor-grid beside Anita's. I\nstraightened to find the brigand gazing at her. He did not speak; he\nwas still scowling. But in the dim blue glow of the cubby I caught the\nlook in his eyes.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI said hastily, \"Grantline knows your ship has landed here on\nArchimedes. His camp is off there on the Mare Imbrium. He sent up a\nsignal--you saw it, didn't you?--just before Miss Prince and I came\naboard. He was trying to pretend that he was your Earth-party, Miko\nand Coniston.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nThe fellow turned his scowl on me, but Anita brought his gaze back to\nher. She put in quickly:\n\n\"Grantline, as Brother always said, has no great cunning. I believe\nhe's planning now to creep up on us, catch us unaware by pretending\nthat he is Miko.\"\n\n\"If he does that,\" I said, \"we will turn this electronic projector on\nhim and annihilate him. You have its firing mechanism here.\"\n\n\"Who told you so?\" he shot at me.\n\nI gestured. \"I see it here. It's obvious. I'm skilled at\ntrajectory-firing. If Grantline appears down there now, I'll help\nyou--\"\n\n\"Is it connected?\" Anita demanded boldly.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"You have on your Erentz suits: are you going to the\ndome-roof? Then go.\"\n\nBut that was what we did not want to do. Anita's glance seemed to tell\nme to let her handle this. I turned toward one of the cubby windows;\nshe said sweetly:\n\n\"Are you in charge of this room? Show me how that projector is\noperated; it will be invincible against the Grantline camp.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI had my back to them for a moment. Through the breast-high oval I\ncould see down across the deck-space and out through the side dome\nwindows. And my heart suddenly leaped into my throat. It seemed that\ndown there in the Earthlit shadows, where the spreading base of the\ngiant crater joined the plains, a light was bobbing. I gazed,\nstricken. Miko's lights? Was he advancing, preparing to signal? I\ntried to gauge the distance; it was not over two miles from here.\n\nOr was it not a light at all? With the naked eye, I could not be sure.\nPerhaps there was a telescopic finder here in the cubby....\n\nI was subconsciously aware of the voices of Anita and the duty-man\nbehind me. Then abruptly I heard Anita's low cry. I whirled around.\n\nThe giant Martian had gathered her into his huge arms, his\nheavy-jowled gray face with a leering grin close to hers!\n\nHe saw me coming. He held her with one arm: his other flung at me,\ncaught me, knocked me backward. He rasped:\n\n\"Get out of here! Go up to the dome, leave us.\"\n\nAnita was silently struggling with her little hands at his thick\nthroat. His blow flung me against a settle. But I held my feet. I was\npartly behind him. I leaped again, and as he tried to disengage\nhimself from Anita to front me, her clutching fingers impeded him.\n\nMy bullet projector was in my hand. But in that second as I leaped, I\nhad the sense to realize I should not fire it and with its noise alarm\nthe ship. I grasped its barrel, reached upward and struck with its\nheavy metal butt. The blow caught the Martian on the skull, and\nsimultaneously my body struck him.\n\nWe went down together, falling partly upon Anita. But the giant had\nnot cried out, and as I gripped him now, I felt his body limp. I lay\npanting. Anita squirmed silently from under us. Blood from the giant's\nhead was welling out, hot and sticky against my face as I lay sprawled\non him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI cast him off. He was dead, his fragile Martian skull split open by\nmy blow.\n\nThere had been no alarm. The slight noise we made had not been heard\ndown on the busy deck. Anita and I crouched by the floor. From the\ndeck all this part of the room could not be seen.\n\n\"Dead!\"\n\n\"Oh, Gregg--\"\n\nIt forced our hand. I could not wait now for Miko to come. But I could\nflash the Earth signal now, and then we would have to make our run to\nescape.\n\nAbruptly I remembered that light down at the crater-base! I kept Anita\nout of sight on the floor and went cautiously to a window. The deck\nwas in turmoil with brigands moving about excitedly. Not because of\nwhat had happened in our tower signal room; they were unaware of that.\n\nMiko's signals were showing! I could see them now plainly, down at the\ncrater-base. A group of hand-lights and a small waving helio-beam.\n\nAnd they were being answered from the ship! Potan was on the deck--a\nbabble of voices, above which his rose with roars of command. At one\nof the dome windows a brigand with a hand search-beam was sending its\nanswering light. And I saw that Potan was working over a deck\ntelescope-finder.\n\nIt had all come so suddenly that I was stunned. But I did not wait to\nread the signals. I swung back at Anita.\n\n\"It's Miko! And they are answering him! Get your helmet; I'll try\nfiring the projector.\"\n\nOr would I instead try to send a brief flash-signal to Earth? There\nwould be no time to do both: we must escape out of here. The route up\nthrough the dome was the only feasible one now.\n\nThis range mechanism of the projector was reasonably familiar, and I\nfelt that I could operate it. The range-finder and switch were on a\nledge at one of the windows. I rushed to it. As I swung the little\ntelescope, training it down on Miko's lights, I could see the huge\nprojector on the deck swinging similarly. Its movement surprised the\nmen who were attending it. One of them called up to me, but I ignored\nhim.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen Potan looked up and saw me. He shouted in Martian at the\nduty-man, whom he doubtless thought was behind me: \"Be ready! We may\nfire on them, whoever they are. I'll give you the word.\"\n\nThe signals were proceeding. It had only been a moment. I caught\nsomething like, \"_Haljan is impostor._\"\n\nI was aiming the projector. I was aware of Anita at my elbow. I pushed\nher back.\n\n\"Put on your helmet!\"\n\nI had the range. I flung the firing switch.\n\nAt the deck window the giant projector spat its deadly electronic\nstream. The men down there leaped away from it with surprise. I heard\nPotan's voice, his shout of protest and anger.\n\nBut down in the Earthglow at the crater-base, Miko's lights had not\nvanished! I had missed! An error in the range? Abruptly I knew it was\nnot that. Miko's lights were still there. His signals still coming.\nAnd I remarked now a faint distortion about them, the glow of his\nlittle group of hand-lights faintly distorted and vaguely shot with a\ngreenish cast. Benson curve-lights! I realized it.\n\nMy thoughts whirled in the few seconds while I stood there at the\ntower window. Miko had feared he might summarily be fired upon. He had\ngone back to his camp, equipped all his lights with the Benson curve.\nHe was somewhere at the crater-base now. But not where I thought I saw\nhim! The Benson curve-light changed the path of the light-rays\ntraveling from him to me--I could not even approximate his true\nposition!\n\nAnita was plucking at me. \"Gregg, come.\"\n\n\"I can't hit him!\" I gasped.\n\nShould I try the flash-signal to Earth? Did we dare linger here? I\nstood another few seconds fascinated at the window. I saw Potan down\nin the confusion of the deck, training a telescope. He had shouted up\nviolently at his duty-man here not to fire again.\n\nAnd now he suddenly let out a roar. \"I can see them! It's Miko! By the\nAlmighty--his giant stature--Brotow, look! That's not an Earthman!\"\n\nHe flung aside his little telescope finder. \"Disconnect that\nprojector! It's Miko down there! This Haljan is a trickster! Where is\nhe? Braile--Braile, you accursed fool! Are Haljan and the girl up\nthere with you?\"\n\nBut the duty-man lay weltering in his blood at our feet.\n\nI had dropped back from the window. Anita and I crouched for an\ninstant in confusion, fumbling with our helmets.\n\nThe ship rang with the alarm. And amid the turmoil we could hear the\nshouts of the infuriated brigands swarming up the tower ladder after\nus!\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\n_A Speck Amid the Stars_\n\nI was only inactive a moment. I had thought Anita would have on her\nhelmet. But she was reluctant, or confused.\n\n\"Gregg.\"\n\n\"We've got to get out of here! Up through the overhead locks to the\ndome.\"\n\n\"Yes--\" She fumbled with the helmet. Under the floor-grid the climbing\nmen on the ladder were audible. They were already nearing the top. The\ntrap door was closed: Anita and I were crouching on it. There was a\nthick metal bar set in a depressed groove of the grid. I slid it in\nplace--it would seal the trap for a time, at any rate.\n\nA degree of confidence came to me. We had a few moments before there\ncould be any hand-to-hand conflict. That giant electronic projector\nwould eventually be used against Grantline: it was the brigands' most\npowerful weapon. Its controls were here--by Heaven, I would smash\nthem! That at least I could do!\n\nI jumped for the window. Miko's signals had stopped, but I caught a\nglimpse of his distant moving curve-lights.\n\nA flash came up at me, as in the window I became visible to the\nbrigands on the ship's deck. It was a small hand-projector, hastily\nfired, for it went wide of the window. It was followed by a rain of\nsmall beams, but I was warned and I dropped my head beneath the high\nsill. The rays flashed diagonally upward through the oval opening,\nhissed against our vaulted roof. The air snapped and tingled with a\nshower of blue-red sparks, and the acrid odor of the released gases\nsettled down upon me.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe trajectory controls of the projector were beside me. I seized\nthem, ripped and tore at them. There was a roar down on the deck. The\nprojector had exploded. A man's agonized scream split the confusion of\nsounds.\n\nIt silenced the brigands on the deck. Under our floor-grid those on\nthe ladder had been pounding at the trap-door. They stopped, evidently\nto see what had happened. The bombardment of our windows ceased\nmomentarily.\n\nI cautiously peered out the window again. In the wreck of the\nprojector three men were lying. One of them was screaming horribly.\nThe dome-side was damaged. Potan and other men were frantically\ninvestigating to see if the ship's air were hissing out.\n\nA triumph swept me. They had not found me so meek and inoffensive as\nthey might have thought!\n\nAnita clutched at me. She still had not donned her helmet.\n\n\"Put it on!\"\n\n\"But Gregg--\"\n\n\"Put it on!\"\n\n\"I--I don't want to put it on until you put yours on.\"\n\n\"I've smashed the projector! We've stopped them coming up for a\nwhile.\"\n\nBut they were still on the ladder under our floor. They heard our\nvoices; they began thumping again. Then pounding. They seemed now to\nhave some heavy implement. They rammed with it against the trap.\n\nBut the floor seemed holding. The square of metal grid trembled,\nyielded a little. But it was good for a few minutes longer.\n\nI called down, \"The first one who comes through will be shot.\" My\nwords mingled with their oaths. There was a moment's pause, then the\nramming went on. The dying man on the deck was still screaming.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI whispered, \"I'll try an Earth-signal.\"\n\nShe nodded. Pale, tense, but calm. \"Yes, Gregg. And I was thinking--\"\n\n\"It won't take a minute. Have your helmet ready.\"\n\n\"I was thinking--\"\n\nShe hurried across the room. I swung on the Botz signaling apparatus.\nIt was connected. Within a moment I had it humming. The fluorescent\ntubes lighted with their lurid glare; they painted purple the body of\nthe giant duty-man who lay sprawled at my feet. I drew on all the\nship's power. The tube-lights in the room quivered and went dim.\n\nI would have to hurry. Potan could shut this off from the main hull\ncontrol room. I could see, through the room's upper trap, the primary\nsending mirror mounted in the peak of the dome. It was quivering,\nradiant with its light-energy. I sent the flash.\n\nThe flattened, past-full Earth was up there. I knew that the western\nhemisphere faced the Moon at this hour. I flashed in English, with the\nopen Universal Earth-code:\n\n\"_Help! Grantline._\"\n\nAnd again: \"_Send help! Archimedes region near Apennines. Attacked by\nbrigands. Send help at once! Grantline!_\"\n\nIf only it would be received! I flung off the current. Anita stood\nwatching me intently. \"Gregg, look!\"\n\nShe had taken some of the glass globe-bombs which lay by the foot of\nthe ascending ladder. She held some of them now.\n\n\"Gregg. I threw some.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt the window we gazed down. The globes she flung had shattered on the\ndeck. They were occulting darkness bombs.[5]\n\n[Footnote 5: Filled with an odorless, harmless gas, these bombs were\nused in warfare, taking the place of the old-fashioned smoke screens.\nThe diffusing gas was of such a nature that, when released, it\nabsorbed within itself all the color inherent to the light-rays\nstriking it, thus creating a temporary darkness.]\n\nThrough the blackness of the deck, the shouts of the brigands came up.\nThey were stumbling about. But the ramming of our trap went on, and I\nsaw that it was beginning to yield. One corner of it was bent up.\n\n\"We've got to go, Anita!\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nFrom out of the darkness which hung like a shroud over the deck an\noccasional flash came up, unaimed--wide of our windows. But the\ndarkness was dissipating. I could see now the dim glow of the deck\nlights, blurred as through a heavy fog.\n\nI dropped another of the bombs.\n\n\"Put on your helmet.\"\n\n\"Yes--yes, I will. You put on yours.\"\n\nWe had them adjusted in a moment. Our Erentz motors were pumping.\n\nI gripped her. \"Put out your helmet-light.\"\n\nShe extinguished it. I handed her my bullet projector.\n\n\"Hold it a moment. I'm going to take that belt of bombs.\"\n\nThe trap-door was all but broken under the ramming blows of the men on\nthe ladder. I leaped over the body of the duty-man, seized the belt of\nbombs and strapped it about my waist.\n\nAnita stood with me.\n\n\"Give me the projector.\"\n\nShe handed it to me. The trap-door burst upward! A man's head and\nshoulders appeared. I fired a bullet into him--the little leaden\npellet singing down through the yellow powder-flash that spat from the\nprojector's muzzle.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe brigand screamed, and dropped back out of sight. There was\nconfusion at the ladder-top. I flung a bomb at the broken trap. A tiny\nheat-ray came wavering up through the opening, but went wide of us.\n\nThe instrument room was in darkness. I clung to Anita.\n\n\"Hold on to me! You go first--here is the ladder.\"\n\nWe found it in the blackness, mounted it and went through the cubby's\nroof-trap.\n\nI took a hasty look and dropped another bomb beside us. The four-foot\nspace up here between the cubby roof and the overhead dome went black.\nWe were momentarily concealed.\n\nAnita located the manual levers of the lock-entrance.\n\n\"Here, Gregg.\"\n\nI shoved at them. Fear leaped in me that they would not operate. But\nthey swung. The tiny porte opened wide to receive us. We clambered\ninto the small air-chamber; the door slid closed, just as a flash from\nbelow struck at it. The brigands had seen our little cloud of darkness\nand were firing up through it.\n\nWe were through the locks in a moment, out on the open dome-top. A sleek,\nrounded spread of glassite, with broad aluminite girders. There were\ncross-ribs which gave us footing, and occasional projections--streamline\nfin-tips, the casings of the upper rudder shafts, and the upstanding\nstubby funnels into which the helicopters were folded.\n\nWe moved along the central footpath and crouched by a six-foot casing.\nThe stars and the glowing Earth were over us. The curving dome-top--a\nhundred feet or so in length, and bulging thirty feet wide beneath\nus--glistened in the Earthlight. It was a sheer drop down these\ncurving sides past the ship's hull, a hundred feet to the rocks on\nwhich the vessel rested. The towering wall of Archimedes was beside\nus; and beyond the brink of the ledge the thousands of feet down to\nthe plains.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI saw the lights of Miko's band down there. He had stopped signaling.\nHis little lights were spread out, bobbing as he and his men advanced\nup the crater's foothills, coming to join their ship.\n\nI had an instant's glimpse. Anita and I could not stay here. The\nbrigands would follow us up in a moment. I saw no exterior ladder. We\nwould have to take our chances and jump.\n\nThere were brigands down there on the rocks. I saw three or four\nskulking helmeted figures, and they saw us! A bullet whizzed by us,\nand then came the flash of a hand-ray.\n\nI touched Anita. \"Can you make the leap? Anita, dear....\"\n\nAgain it seemed that this must be farewell.\n\n\"Gregg, dear one--oh, we've got to do it!\"\n\nThose waiting figures would pounce on us.\n\n\"Anita, lie here a moment.\"\n\nI jumped up and ran twenty feet toward the bow; then back, toward the\nstern, flinging down the last of my bombs. The darkness was like a\ncloud down there, enveloping the outer brigands. But up here we were\nabove it, etched by the starlight and Earthglow.\n\nI came back to Anita.\n\n\"We'll have to chance it now.\"\n\n\"Gregg....\"\n\n\"Good-by, dear. I'll jump first, down this side--you follow.\"\n\nTo leap into that black patch, with the rocks under it....\n\n\"Gregg--\"\n\nShe was trying to tell me to look overhead. She gestured. \"Gregg,\nsee!\"\n\nI saw it out over the plains--a little speck amid the stars. A moving\nspeck, coming toward us!\n\n\"Gregg, what is it?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI gazed, held my breath. A moving speck out there. A blob now.\n\nAnd then I realized that it was not a large object, far away, but\nsmall, and already very close--only a few hundred feet off, dropping\ntoward the top of our dome. A narrow, flat, ten-foot object, like a\nwingless volplane. There were no lights on it, but in the Earthlight I\ncould see two crouching, helmeted figures riding it.\n\n\"Anita! Don't you remember!\"\n\nI was swept with dawning comprehension. Back in the Grantline camp\nSnap and I had discussed how to use the _Planetara's_ gravity plates.\nWe had gone to the wreck and secured them, had rigged this little\nvolplane flyer....\n\nThe brigands on the rocks saw it now. A flash went up at it. One of\nthe figures crouching on it opened a flexible fabric like a wing over\nits side. I saw another flash from below, harmlessly striking the\ninsulated shield.\n\nI gasped to Anita, \"Light your helmet! It's from Grantline! Let them\nsee us!\"\n\nI stood erect. The little flying platform went over us, fifty feet up,\ncircling, dropping to the dome-top.\n\nI waved my helmet-light. The exit-lock from below--up which we had\ncome--was near us. The advancing brigands were already in it! I had\nforgotten to demolish the manuals. And I saw that the darkness down on\nthe rocks was almost gone now, dissipating in the airless night. The\nbrigands down there began firing up at us.\n\nIt was a confusion of flashing lights. I clutched at Anita.\n\n\"Come this way--run!\"\n\nThe platform barely missed our heads. It sailed lengthwise of the\ndome-top, and crashed silently on the central runway near the\nstern-tip. Anita and I ran to it.\n\nThe two helmeted figures seized us, shoved us prone on the metal\nplatform. It was barely four feet wide: a low railing, handles with\nwhich to cling, and a tiny hooded cubby in front, with banks of\ncontrols.\n\n\"Gregg!\"\n\n\"Snap!\"\n\nIt was Snap and Venza. She seized Anita, held her crouching in place.\nSnap flung himself face down at the controls.\n\nThe brigands in the lock were out on the dome now. I took a last shot\nas we lifted. My bullet punctured one of them; he fell, slid\nscrambling off the rounded dome and dropped out of sight.\n\nLight-rays and silent flashes seemed to envelop us. Venza held the\nside-shields higher.\n\nWe tilted, swayed crazily, and then steadied.\n\nThe ship's dome dropped away beneath us. The rocks of the open ledge\nwere under us. Then the abyss, with the moving climbing specks of\nMiko's lights far down.\n\nI saw, over the side-shield, the already distant brigand ship resting\non the ledge with the massive Archimedes' wall behind it. A confusion\nback there of futile flashing rays.\n\nIt all faded into a remote glow as we sailed smoothly up into the\nstarlight and away, heading for the Grantline camp.\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\n_Besieged!_\n\n\"Wake up, Gregg! They're coming!\"\n\nI forced myself to consciousness. \"Coming--\"\n\n\"Yes. Wake up!\"\n\nI leaped from my bunk, followed Snap with a rush into the corridor. We\nhad returned safely to the Grantline Camp. Anita and I found ourselves\nexhausted from lack of sleep, our arduous climb of Archimedes and that\ntense time on the brigand ship. On the flight back Snap had explained\nhow the landing of the ship on Archimedes was observed through the\nGrantline telescope, using but little of its power for this local\nrange. They had read with amazement my signals to the brigands. Snap\nhad rushed to completion the first of our contemplated flying\nplatforms. Then he had seen Miko's signals from the crater-base, seen\nthe lights of the fight to capture Anita and me in the cubby, and had\ncome to rescue us.\n\nBack at the camp we were given food, and Grantline forced me to try\nand sleep.\n\n\"They'll be on us in a few hours, Gregg. Miko will have joined them by\nnow. He'll lead them to us. You must rest, for we need everyone at his\nbest.\"\n\nAnd surprisingly, in the midst of the camp's turmoil of last minute\nactivities, I slept soundly, until Snap called me that the ship was\ncoming.\n\nThe corridor echoed with the tramp of Grantline's busy crew. But there\nwas no confusion now; a grim calmness had settled upon everyone.\n\nAnita and Venza rushed up to join us. \"It's in sight!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was no need of going to the instrument room. From the windows\nfronting the brink of the cliff the brigand ship was plainly visible.\nIt came sailing from Archimedes, a dark shape blurring the stars. All\nits lights were extinguished save a single white search-beam in the\nbow-peak, slanting diagonally down.\n\nThe beam presently caught our little group of buildings; its glare\nshone in the windows as it clung for a moment. I could envisage the\ntriumphant curiosity, of Potan and his fellows up there, gazing along\nthe beam.\n\nThen it swung away. The ship was at an altitude of no more than three\nthousand feet when I first saw it, coming upon a level keel. Would it\ncircle over us, firing at us? Or sail past, after inspecting us? Or\nland, perhaps, boldly crowded upon our little ledge?\n\nWe were ready--as ready as we could be with our meager equipment. The\ncamp was in a state of siege. The cliff-lights were extinguished: the\ninterior lights were dim, save in the workshops of the main building,\nwhere the final assembling of Snap's other flying platforms and their\ninsulated protective shields was still in progress.\n\nWe had dimmed the lights to conserve our power, and to enable the\nErentz motors to run at full capacity. Our buildings would have to\nwithstand the brigand rays which soon would be upon us.\n\nOutside on our dim, Earthlit cliff, the tiny lights showed where our\nfew guards were lurking. As I stood at the window watching the\noncoming ship, Grantline's voice sounded:\n\n\"Call in those men! Ring the call-lights, Franck!\"\n\nThe siren buzzed over the camp's interior; the warning call-lights on\nthe roof brought in the outer guards. They came running to the\nadmission portes, which had been repaired after Miko disabled them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe guards came in. We dimmed our lights further. The treasure sheds\nwere black against the cliff behind us. No need for guards there--the\nbulk of the ore was such that we reasoned the brigands would not\nattempt to move it until our buildings were captured. But, if they\nshould try it, we were prepared to sally out with our hand-weapons and\ndefend it.\n\nIn the dim lights we crouched. A silence was upon us, save for the\nclanging in the workshop down the corridor. Most of us wore our Erentz\nsuits, with helmets ready, though I am sure there was not a man of us\nbut who prayed he might not have to go out. At many of the\nwindows--our weakest points to withstand the rays--insulated fabric\nshields were hung like curtains.\n\nThe brigand ship slowly advanced. It was soon over the opposite rim of\nour little crater. Its search-beam swung about the rim and down into\nthe valley.\n\nMy thoughts ran like a turgid stream as I stood tensely watching.\n\nFour hours ago I had sent that flash-signal to Earth. If it were\nreceived, a patrol-ship could come to our rescue and arrive here in\nanother eight hours--or perhaps even less.\n\nAh, that \"if!\" _If_ the signal were received! _If_ the patrol-ship\nwere immediately available! _If_ it started at once....\n\nEight hours at the very least. I tried to assure myself that we could\nhold out that long....\n\nThe brigand ship crossed the opposite crater-rim. It dropped lower. It\nseemed poised over the crater-valley, almost at our own level and less\nthan two miles from us. Its search-beam vanished. For a moment it\nhung, a sleek, cylindrical silver shape, gleaming in the Earthlight.\n\nSnap looked at me and murmured, \"It's descending.\"\n\nIt slowly settled, cautiously picked its landing-place amid the crags\nand pits of the tumbled scarred valley floor. It came to rest, a vague\nsilver menacing shape lurking in the lower shadows, close at the foot\nof the inner opposite crater-wall.\n\nA few moments of tense waiting passed. Soon tiny lights were moving\ndown there, some out on the rocks near the ship, others up under its\ndeck-dome.\n\nA stab of searchlight shot across the valley, swung along our ledge\nand clung with its glaring ten-foot circle to the front of our main\nbuilding. Then a ray flashed.\n\nThe assault had begun!\n\n(_To be concluded_)\n\n[Advertisement:]\n\n\n\n\nThe Jovian Jest\n\n_By Lilith Lorraine_\n\n[Illustration: _The object shot forth another tentacle._]\n\n[Sidenote: There came to our pigmy planet a radiant wanderer with a\nmessage--and a jest--from the vasty universe.]\n\n\nConsternation reigned in Elsnore village when the Nameless Thing was\ndiscovered in Farmer Burns' corn-patch. When the rumor began to gain\ncredence that it was some sort of meteor from inter-stellar space,\nreporters, scientists and college professors flocked to the scene,\ndesirous of prying off particles for analysis. But they soon\ndiscovered that the Thing was no ordinary meteor, for it glowed at\nnight with a peculiar luminescence. They also observed that it was\npractically weightless, since it had embedded itself in the soft sand\nscarcely more than a few inches.\n\nBy the time the first group of newspapermen and scientists had reached\nthe farm, another phenomenon was plainly observable. The Thing was\ngrowing!\n\nFarmer Burns, with an eye to profit, had already built a picket fence\naround his starry visitor and was charging admission. He also flatly\nrefused to permit the chipping off of specimens or even the touching\nof the object. His attitude was severely criticized, but he stubbornly\nclung to the theory that possession is nine points in law.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was Professor Ralston of Princewell who, on the third day after the\nfall of the meteor, remarked upon its growth. His colleagues crowded\naround him as he pointed out this peculiarity, and soon they\ndiscovered another factor--pulsation!\n\nLarger than a small balloon, and gradually, almost imperceptibly\nexpanding, with its viscid transparency shot through with opalescent\nlights, the Thing lay there in the deepening twilight and palpably\nshivered. As darkness descended, a sort of hellish radiance began to\nooze from it. I say hellish, because there is no other word to\ndescribe that spectral, sulphurous emanation.\n\nAs the hangers-on around the pickets shudderingly shrank away from the\nweird light that was streaming out to them and tinting their faces\nwith a ghastly, greenish pallor, Farmer Burns' small boy, moved by\nsome imp of perversity, did a characteristically childish thing. He\npicked up a good-sized stone and flung it straight at the nameless\nmass!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nInstead of veering off and falling to the ground as from an impact\nwith metal, the stone sank right through the surface of the Thing as\ninto a pool of protoplastic slime. When it reached the central core of\nthe object, a more abundant life suddenly leaped and pulsed from\ncenter to circumference. Visible waves of sentient color circled round\nthe solid stone. Stabbing swords of light leaped forth from them,\npiercing the stone, crumbling it, absorbing it. When it was gone, only\na red spot, like a bloodshot eye, throbbed eerily where it had been.\n\nBefore the now thoroughly mystified crowd had time to remark upon this\ninexplicable disintegration, a more horrible manifestation occurred.\nThe Thing, as though thoroughly awakened and vitalized by its unusual\nfare, was putting forth a tentacle. Right from the top of the\nshivering globe it pushed, sluggishly weaving and prescient of doom.\nWavering, it hung for a moment, turning, twisting, groping. Finally it\nshot straight outward swift as a rattler's strike!\n\nBefore the closely packed crowd could give room for escape, it had\ncircled the neck of the nearest bystander, Bill Jones, a cattleman,\nand jerked him, writhing and screaming, into the reddish core.\nStupefied with soul-chilling terror, with their mass-consciousness\npractically annihilated before a deed with which their minds could\nmake no association, the crowd could only gasp in sobbing unison and\nawait the outcome.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe absorption of the stone had taught them what to expect, and for a\nmoment it seemed that their worst anticipations were to be realised. The\nsluggish currents circled through the Thing, swirling the victim's body to\nthe center. The giant tentacle drew back into the globe and became itself\na current. The concentric circles merged--tightened--became one gleaming\ncord that encircled the helpless prey. From the inner circumference of\nthis cord shot forth, not the swords of light that had powdered the stone\nto atoms, but myriads of radiant tentacles that gripped and cupped the\nbody in a thousand places.\n\nSuddenly the tentacles withdrew themselves, all save the ones that\ngrasped the head. These seemed to tighten their pressure--to swell and\npulse with a grayish substance that was flowing from the cups into the\ncord and from the cord into the body of the mass. Yes, it was a\ngrayish something, a smokelike Essence that was being drawn from the\ncranial cavity. Bill Jones was no longer screaming and gibbering, but\nwas stiff with the rigidity of stone. Notwithstanding, there was no\nvisible mark upon his body; his flesh seemed unharmed.\n\nSwiftly came the awful climax. The waving tentacles withdrew\nthemselves, the body of Bill Jones lost its rigidity, a heaving motion\nfrom the center of the Thing propelled its cargo to the surface--and\nBill Jones stepped out!\n\nYes, he stepped out and stood for a moment staring straight ahead,\nstaring at nothing, glassily. Every person in the shivering, paralysed\ngroup knew instinctively that something unthinkable had happened to\nhim. Something had transpired, something hitherto possible only in the\nabysmal spaces of the Other Side of Things. Finally he turned and\nfaced the nameless object, raising his arm stiffly, automatically, as\nin a military salute. Then he turned and walked jerkily, mindlessly,\nround and round the globe like a wooden soldier marching. Meanwhile\nthe Thing lay quiescent--gorged!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nProfessor Ralston was the first to find his voice. In fact, Professor\nRalston was always finding his voice in the most unexpected places.\nBut this time it had caught a chill. It was trembling.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" he began, looking down academically upon the motley crowd\nas though doubting the aptitude of his salutation. \"Fellow-citizens,\"\nhe corrected, \"the phenomenon we have just witnessed is, to the lay\nmind, inexplicable. To me--and to my honorable colleagues (added as an\nafterthought) it is quite clear. Quite clear, indeed. We have before\nus a specimen, a perfect specimen, I might say, of a--of a--\"\n\nHe stammered in the presence of the unnamable. His hesitancy caused\nthe rapt attention of the throng that was waiting breathlessly for an\nexplanation, to flicker back to the inexplicable. In the fraction of a\nsecond that their gaze had been diverted from the Thing to the\nprofessor, the object had shot forth another tentacle, gripping him\nround the neck and choking off his sentence with a horrid rasp that\nsounded like a death rattle.\n\nNeedless to say, the revolting process that had turned Bill Jones\nfrom a human being into a mindless automaton was repeated with\nProfessor Ralston. It happened as before, too rapidly for\nintervention, too suddenly for the minds of the onlookers to shake off\nthe paralysis of an unprecedented nightmare. But when the victim was\nthrown to the surface, when he stepped out, drained of the grayish\nsmokelike essence, a tentacle still gripped his neck and another\nrested directly on top of his head. This latter tentacle, instead of\nabsorbing _from_ him, visibly poured into him what resembled a\nthreadlike stream of violet light.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFacing the cowering audience with eyes staring glassily, still in the\ngrip of the unknowable, Professor Ralston did an unbelievable thing.\nHe resumed his lecture at the exact point of interruption! But he\nspoke with the tonelessness of a machine, a machine that pulsed to the\nwill of a dictator, inhuman and inexorable!\n\n\"What you see before you,\" the Voice continued--the Voice that no\nlonger echoed the thoughts of the professor--\"is what you would call\nan amoeba, a giant amoeba. It is I--this amoeba, who am addressing\nyou--children of an alien universe. It is I, who through this captured\ninstrument of expression, whose queer language you can understand, am\nexplaining my presence on your planet. I pour my thoughts into this\nspecialised brain-box which I have previously drained of its meager\nthought-content.\" (Here the \"honorable colleagues\" nudged each other\ngleefully.) \"I have so drained it for the purpose of analysis and that\nthe flow of my own ideas may pass from my mind to yours unimpeded by\nany distortion that might otherwise be caused by their conflict with\nthe thoughts of this individual.\n\n\"First I absorbed the brain-content of this being whom you call Bill\nJones, but I found his mental instrument unavailable. It was\ntechnically untrained in the use of your words that would best convey\nmy meaning. He possesses more of what you would call 'innate\nintelligence,' but he has not perfected the mechanical brain through\nwhose operation this innate intelligence can be transmitted to others\nand, applied for practical advantage.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Now this creature that I am using is, as you might say, full of sound\nwithout meaning. His brain is a lumber-room in which he has hoarded a\nconglomeration of clever and appropriate word-forms with which to\ndisguise the paucity of his ideas, with which to express nothing! Yet\nthe very abundance of the material in his storeroom furnishes a\ndiscriminating mind with excellent tools for the transportation of its\nideas into other minds.\n\n\"Know, then, that I am not here by accident. I am a Space Wanderer, an\nexplorer from a super-universe whose evolution has proceeded without\nvariation along the line of your amoeba. Your evolution, as I perceive\nfrom an analysis of the brain-content of your professor, _began_ its\nunfoldment in somewhat the same manner as our own. But in your smaller\nsystem, less perfectly adjusted than our own to the cosmic mechanism,\na series of cataclysms occurred. In fact, your planetary system was\nitself the result of a catastrophe, or of what might have been a\ncatastrophe, had the two great suns collided whose near approach\ncaused the wrenching off of your planets. From this colossal accident,\nrare, indeed, in the annals of the stars, an endless chain of\naccidents was born, a chain of which this specimen, this professor,\nand the species that he represents, is one of the weakest links.\n\n\"Your infinite variety of species is directly due to the variety of\nadaptations necessitated by this train of accidents. In the\nsuper-universe from which I come, such derangements of the celestial\nmachinery simply do not happen. For this reason, our evolution has\nunfolded harmoniously along one line of development, whereas yours\nhas branched out into diversified and grotesque expressions of the\nLife-Principle. Your so-called highest manifestation of this\nprinciple, namely, your own species, is characterized by a great\nnumber of specialized organs. Through this very specialization of\nfunctions, however, you have forfeited your individual immortality,\nand it has come about that only your life-stream is immortal. The\nprimal cell is inherently immortal, but death follows in the wake of\nspecialization.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"We, the beings of this amoeba universe, are individually immortal. We\nhave no highly specialized organs to break down under the stress of\nenvironment. When we want an organ, we create it. When it has served\nits purpose, we withdraw it into ourselves. We reach out our tentacles\nand draw to ourselves whatsoever we desire. Should a tentacle be\ndestroyed, we can put forth another.\n\n\"Our universe is beautiful beyond the dreams of your most inspired\npoets. Whereas your landscapes, though lovely, are stationary,\nunchangeable except through herculean efforts, ours are Protean,\neternally changing. With our own substance, we build our minarets of\nlight, piercing the aura of infinity. At the bidding of our wills we\ncreate, preserve, destroy--only to build again more gloriously.\n\n\"We draw our sustenance from the primates, as do your plants, and we\nconstantly replace the electronic base of these primates with our own\nemanations, in much the same manner as your nitrogenous plants\nrevitalize your soil.\n\n\"While we create and withdraw organs at will, we have nothing to\ncorrespond to your five senses. We derive knowledge through one sense\nonly, or, shall I say, a super-sense? We see and hear and touch and\ntaste and smell and feel and know, not through any one organ, but\nthrough our whole structure. The homogeneous force of our\nomni-substance subjects the plural world to the processing of a\npowerful unity.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"We can dissolve our bodies at will, retaining only the permanent atom\nof our being, the seed of life dropped on the soil of our planet by\nInfinite Intelligence. We can propel this indestructible seed on light\nrays through the depths of space. We can visit the farthest universe\nwith the velocity of light, since light is our conveyance. In reaching\nyour little world, I have consumed a million years, for my world is a\nmillion light-years distant: yet to my race a million years is as one\nof your days.\n\n\"On arrival at any given destination, we can build our bodies from the\nelements of the foreign planet. We attain our knowledge of conditions\non any given planet by absorbing the thought-content of the brains of\na few representative members of its dominant race. Every well-balanced\nmind contains the experience of the race, the essence of the wisdom\nthat the race-soul has gained during its residence in matter. We make\nthis knowledge a part of our own thought-content, and thus the\nUniverse lies like an open book before us.\n\n\"At the end of a given experiment in thought absorption, we return the\nborrowed mind-stuff to the brain of its possessor. We reward our\nsubject for his momentary discomfiture by pouring into his body our\nsplendid vitality. This lengthens his life expectancy immeasurably, by\nliterally burning from his system the germs of actual or incipient\nills that contaminate the blood-stream.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"This, I believe, will conclude my explanation, an explanation to which\nyou, as a race in whom intelligence is beginning to dawn, are entitled.\nBut you have a long road to travel yet. Your thought-channels are\npitifully blocked and criss-crossed with nonsensical and inhibitory\ncomplexes that stand in the way of true progress. But you will work this\nout, for the Divine Spark that pulses through us of the Larger Universe,\npulses also through you. That spark, once lighted, can never be\nextinguished, can never be swallowed up again in the primeval slime.\n\n\"There is nothing more that I can learn from you--nothing that I can\nteach you at this stage of your evolution. I have but one message to\ngive you, one thought to leave with you--forge on! You are on the\npath, the stars are over you, their light is flashing into your souls\nthe slogan of the Federated Suns beyond the frontiers of your little\nwarring worlds. Forge on!\"\n\nThe Voice died out like the chiming of a great bell receding into\nimmeasurable distance. The supercilious tones of the professor had\nyielded to the sweetness and the light of the Greater Mind whose\ninstrument he had momentarily become. It was charged at the last with\na golden resonance that seemed to echo down vast spaceless corridors\nbeyond the furthermost outposts of time.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs the Voice faded out into a sacramental silence, the strangely\nassorted throng, moved by a common impulse, lowered their heads as\nthough in prayer. The great globe pulsed and shimmered throughout its\nsentient depths like a sea of liquid jewels. Then the tentacle that\ngrasped the professor drew him back toward the scintillating nucleus.\nSimultaneously another arm reached out and grasped Bill Jones, who,\nduring the strange lecture, had ceased his wooden soldier marching and\nhad stood stiffly at attention.\n\nThe bodies of both men within the nucleus were encircled once more by\nthe single current. From it again put forth the tentacles, cupping\ntheir heads, but the smokelike essence flowed back to them this time,\nand with it flowed a tiny threadlike stream of violet light. Then came\nthe heaving motion when the shimmering currents caught the two men and\ntossed them forth unharmed but visibly dowered with the radiance of\nmore abundant life. Their faces were positively glowing and their eyes\nwere illuminated by a light that was surely not of earth.\n\nThen, before the very eyes of the marveling people, the great globe\nbegan to dwindle. The jeweled lights intensified, concentrated,\nmerged, until at last remained only a single spot no larger than a\npin-head, but whose radiance was, notwithstanding, searing,\nexcruciating. Then the spot leaped up--up into the heavens, whirling,\ndipping and circling as in a gesture of farewell, and finally soaring\ninto invisibility with the blinding speed of light.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe whole wildly improbable occurrence might have been dismissed as a\nqueer case of mass delusion, for such cases are not unknown to\nhistory, had it not been followed by a convincing aftermath.\n\nThe culmination of a series of startling coincidences, both ridiculous\nand tragic, at last brought men face to face with an incontestable\nfact: namely, that Bill Jones had emerged from his fiery baptism\nendowed with the thought-expressing facilities of Professor Ralston,\nwhile the professor was forced to struggle along with the meager\neducational appliances of Bill Jones!\n\nIn this ironic manner the Space-Wanderer had left unquestionable proof\nof his visit by rendering a tribute to \"innate intelligence\" and\nplaying a Jovian Jest upon an educated fool--a neat transposition.\n\nA Columbus from a vaster, kindlier universe had paused for a moment to\nlearn the story of our pigmy system. He had brought us a message from\nthe outermost citadels of life and had flashed out again on his aeonic\nvoyage from everlasting unto everlasting.\n\n\nFOR VACATION ADVENTURERS\n\nTruth is stranger than fiction. Ask the Regular Army man who has\nsoldiered in the far-off corners of the earth, gone \"over the top\" in\naction, and has experienced the thrill of service in the tropics or\nthe sub-arctic.\n\nBetter yet, get an earful of real Astounding Stories yourself, at\nfirst hand this summer, as one of the thirty thousand young men\nbetween the ages of seventeen and twenty-four enjoying those thirty\nglorious days and nights as a student-camper at one of Uncle Sam's\nCitizens' Military Training Camps.\n\nAll of these Camps are pitched at Regular Army posts, and it is the\ncustom for grizzled old-timers who have followed the Flag for many\nlong years to drift down to \"the boys\" around campfire time each night\nand regale the student campers with thrilling, real life yarns of\naction and adventure in many strange and unusual circumstances.\n\nIt is not necessary for one to be a rich man's son in order to enjoy\nthe manifold benefits of their Camps. Uncle Sam pays all the necessary\nbills including transportation, the best of food, bedding, laundry\nservice and medical treatment if needed. And there is no obligation\nfor future military service entailed by attendance at any of these\nNation-wide CMT camps.

That fellow's crazy! Took off with the wind\nbehind him! He'll nose dive before he clears the clubhouse! He'll\ncrash into those trees along the edge of the golf course!\"\n\nThe group on the field at Westbury, Long Island, held their breaths as\nthey watched James Dent take off in the wildest, most erratic flight\nthat they had ever seen. Under lowering storm clouds, with the wind\nroaring half a hurricane behind him, Dent spiraled upward as if\nunconscious of the laws of Earthly gravity.\n\n\"I told you so! You ought to have stopped him, even if it is his\nprivate plane! A feller's got no business trying to break his neck!\nLook there! He's cleared those trees after all!\"\n\nJames Dent had cleared them, and the clubhouse too, and was already\ndisappearing across the Hempstead Plains, looking like a leaf whirling\nup in a winter storm. At a height of five hundred feet he sped\neastward.\n\n\"Didn't tell you where he was going?\"\n\n\"Nope, acted like a crazy man. Something on his mind sure. Wherever\nhe's bound for, he'll never get there!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut James Dent was already out of sight, and the little group\ndispersed. And Dent, winging his way due east, over the oak barrens of\ncentral Long Island, was conscious neither of the storm that howled\nabout him nor of the excitement that his rash take-off had occasioned.\n\nThe rain lashed him in the open cockpit, the ground fog swirled about\nhim, and, though it was still afternoon, there brooded a somber\ntwilight over the wastes. But in his mind Dent was already\nanticipating his descent at the \"Vanishing Place,\" as the natives\ncalled it near Peconic Bay.\n\nThe \"Vanishing Place\" was so called because of the terrible and\ninexplicable catastrophe that had occurred there five years\npreviously. In the two-century-old farmhouse, Miles Parrish, the\nworld's greatest authority on physical chemistry, had been conducting\ninvestigations into the structure of the atom.\n\nJames Dent and Lucius Tode had been associated with old Parrish in\nthis work, which, carried to a successful issue, would revolutionize\nthe social organization of the world. The energy locked up in the atom\nis so stupendous that, as Eddington indicated, a thimbleful of coal,\ndisintegrated, would carry the _Mauretania_ from England to America\nand back again. To unlock this energy would be to set man free from\nbondage, to restore the pristine leisure and happiness of Eden.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd because the three men were playing with deadly forces, of\nincalculable power, this deserted spot had been selected for the\ncarrying on of the investigations. The old farmhouse had been\nconverted into a laboratory. For days together the three had bent over\ntheir tubes and laboratory apparatus, hardly eating or sleeping. And\nthe day had come when success had seemed almost within their grasp.\n\nDent had received six months' leave of absence from his duties at\nColumbia University in order to prosecute the experiments. As the\nweeks went by, and the blind track that the three were following\nopened into a clear road, a sort of madness settled upon every one of\nthem.\n\nThe Planck-Bohr quantum theory that the energy of a body cannot vary\ncontinuously, but only by a certain finite amount, or exact multiples\nof this amount, had been the key that unlocked the door. But always it\nhad been Lucius Tode who led the way. Tode was a graduate of the\nUniversity of Virginia, and accounted one of the most brilliant minds\nof his generation. At thirty, he stood head and shoulders above his\ncontemporaries.\n\nDark, handsome, fearless, with a will power that nothing seemed able\nto subdue, he had taken the leadership away from old Miles Parrish,\nwho eagerly and without thought of his own reputation followed in his\nassistant's footsteps.\n\nThere were the three men--and there was the girl, Lucille Parrish, the\nchild of Miles's old age. Seventeen, when the catastrophe occurred,\nshe had come out to the deserted spot sometimes of a Sunday from her\nboarding school at Garden City.\n\nAnd Tode had found time to make love to her when he rushed her back to\nher school in his high-powered foreign car!\n\nJim Dent had known nothing of that until after the catastrophe.\nLucille had been afraid of him, afraid to open her mouth upon the\nsubject even to her father. And she had been fascinated too, as a\nyoung girl may well be, when a fascinating man of thirty uses his arts\nto win her.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was only by chance that Jim had failed to be involved in the\nhideous catastrophe that had stamped the old farmhouse with the name\nof \"Vanishing Place\" whenever the natives spoke of it.\n\n\"Two Killed in Laboratory Explosion!\" was the heading in the next\nmorning's paper which gave Jim his first intimation of the accident.\nHe had been to Columbia overnight to look up a new publication that\ncontained an article on the hydrogen spectrum.\n\nIt was only a long paragraph, and the names of Parrish and Tode meant\nnothing to the man who had written it. But Jim had taken train to\nHempstead, taxied to the flying fields, and essayed his first plane\nride to Peconic Bay, in the charge of a pilot.\n\nA group of natives, three newspaper men and a Suffolk County policeman\nwere near the spot where the farmhouse had been--near the spot, not on\nit.\n\nFor where the farmhouse had been was a great pool of stagnant water,\nblack as ink, covering an expanse of perhaps three-quarters of an\nacre.\n\n\"No, sir, there was no explosion,\" said the officer. \"At least, none\nof these fellows heard anything. Just a--you tell the Professor, Mr.\nLumm.\"\n\n\"It was about half-past eight last night, Mr. Dent,\" said Andrew Lumm,\nwho kept the village store a mile away. \"Ground seemed to rock.\nEarthquake, I says to myself, holdin' on to the door. But it wasn't no\nearthquake. Too gentle for that. Nothin' broke, not even a plate. Then\nI says to Mrs. Lumm, 'They're gone, poor fellers, and I allus knowed\nit would be that way. It's lucky young Mr. Dent went out last night on\nthe 7.15.'\n\n\"We hurried here, but there wasn't no sign of the place, jest a hole\non the ground with a sort of sticky mud in it. Water's been fillin' in\nsince then, but I guess it's reached its level now. They jest blowed\nthemselves to bits, Mr. Dent.\"\n\n\"Tell him about the vi'let light, Andy,\" put in one of the\nbystanders.\n\n\"Yeah, like a pillar of vi'let fire that were, Mr. Dent. We seed it\nthrough the trees, but by the time we got here it was 'most gone.\nGosh, that throwed a scare into some of us!\"\n\n\"It was Mr. Tode's soul a-burnin',\" squeaked Granpop Dawes. \"I allus\nsaid that feller'd come to no good end.\"\n\nThe group shook their heads and remained silent. It was clear that, if\nthey did not share Granpop Dawes's opinion, at least they considered\nit not without the bounds of plausibility. Lucius Tode had created a\nbad impression among the natives.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJim Dent stooped and picked up something lying imbedded in the mud at\nthe edge of the black pool, and slipped it into his pocket. He had\nbeen present at the inquest and had gone back to Columbia. That had\nbeen five years before.\n\nProfessor McDowd, the palaeontologist, had identified the object Jim\nhad found as the milk molar of _merychippus insignis_, the miocene\nrepresentative of the modern horse. And that had made Jim Dent think\nfuriously.\n\nThe catastrophe must have been a gigantic one to have flung up that\nfossil tooth from strata far beneath the level of the earth's surface.\nMore, there were even traces of archaean deposits around the borders\nof the pool, whose depth, in the center, was ascertained to be 164\nfeet.\n\nBlack, silent, uninhabited, unstirred save by a passing breeze, the\npool had remained those five years past. The spot was shunned as\nhaunted or accursed by the superstitious country folks. Dense\nunderbrush had grown up around it.\n\nPeriodically, Jim had gone out to visit it. That was how he had come\nto invest in a private plane. It was only an hour to the\nflying-fields, and less than an hour from there to Peconic Bay. What\nhe expected to achieve he did not know. In the back of his mind was\nthe belief that some day he would light upon some clue that would\ntell something of the unusual catastrophe.\n\nAnd then that afternoon he had been shaken to the depths when a\nmessage came to him in Lucille's voice over the telephone:\n\n\"I've heard from dad!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWinging his way eastward through the storm, Jim Dent was mentally\nreconstructing all that had led up to the present moment.\n\nLucille had finished her high school course and gone into business\nlife. Jim had found a position for her as secretary to a small group\nof physicists, who were conducting private investigations, a position\nfor which her training well fitted her. She had done well. He had kept\nin touch with her.\n\nSix months before, their relations had altered. They had realized that\nthey were in love with each other. In the months that followed they\nhad discovered all sorts of things about each other that neither had\nsuspected, which might be summed up by saying that they had become all\nin all to each other.\n\nIt was so amazing, this transformation of ordinary friendship into\nradiant love, that they were still bewildered over it. They were to be\nmarried at the end of the year.\n\nIt was then that Lucille had first told Jim about Lucius's wooing, and\nher fear of the man. Apart from that, both had refrained, by tacit\nagreement, from making reference to the past.\n\nAnd then, that afternoon, there sounded Lucille's voice over the\ntelephone, \"I've heard from dad!\"\n\n\"From--your father? You're mistaken, dear!\"\n\n\"No, Jim, I'm not mistaken. He called me on the 'phone two hours ago.\nI couldn't mistake his voice, and, besides, he called me \"Lucy,\" like\nhe used to do. He told me to come at once to the Vanishing Place, but\nnot to tell a soul unless I wished to do him a great evil. Then he\nrang off.\"\n\n\"Where are you now?\" asked Jim.\n\n\"I'm 'phoning from Amityville. I took the train immediately, but I\nwas so frightened, and--and at last I decide I must tell you. I didn't\nthink dad would have minded my telling you. So I got out. There's\nanother train in a few minutes, and I shall go on to Hampton Bays and\nwalk the two miles to the Vanishing Place. I--I'll meet you there.\"\n\n\"Lucille, wait! Can't you meet me somewhere else, and we'll go on\ntogether. I'll get my plane and--\"\n\n\"Oh, I just can't wait, Jim! I'm in such terror that I won't find dad\nwhen I get there. And he told me to tell nobody. I--I'll meet you at\nthe Vanishing Place, Jim.\"\n\nAnd so great had been her agitation that with that arrangement Jim had\nhad to rest content. He had taken a taxi out to the flying fields at\nonce.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn half an hour he would know what had happened. And he was obsessed\nby the terror that he would not find Lucille or anything except the\nlonely pool.\n\nThat was why he opened the throttle and drove on wildly through the\nscurrying wraiths of mist, pierced by the tops of trees that at times\nrose dangerously near the spreading wings.\n\nThat gap in the trees was Lake Ronkokoma. Not far now! Jim would know\nsoon. But as he flew, vague fears that had beset his mind since he had\nreceived Lucille's message began to crystallize into the single fear\nof Tode. If Parrish was really alive--why not Tode too?\n\nBeneath the polish and the surface comradeship, Jim had always been\nconscious of some _diablerie_ about the man, of some inner life of\nwhich he knew nothing. Something unscrupulous and relentless,\nsomething infinitely cruel--as when he had tested the Atom Smasher on\na stray cur that had run into the laboratory, not for experimentation,\nbut in mere ruthless savagery, converting the living beast instantly\ninto a shapeless mass of flesh and bone.\n\nAnd Tode had known more about the Atom Smasher--as they affectionately\ncalled the mechanism for releasing atomic energy--than old Parrish and\nhe together. Suppose Lucille's story were true! Suppose old Parrish\nwere actually alive, suppose Tode were responsible for some designed\nscheme which would, in the end place Lucille in his power!\n\nWild thoughts and fears--but Jim would soon know. And with throttle\nstretched to the limit he went roaring over the scrub oak toward\nPeconic Bay.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was beginning to grow dark, almost too dark for landing. But now\nJim could feel the tang of the salt wind upon his face. He slowed\ndown. The fog was as thick as ever, but the scrub oak had given place\nto more open country. In a minute or two he ought to sight some\nlandmark. Yes, he had overshot his mark, for suddenly, through a gap\nin the mists, he saw the line of breakers forming a white ridge upon\nthe sand.\n\nA mile southward! Jim knew where he was now, for he knew every curve\nof that shore. He banked and turned. And then he saw something that\nfor an instant chilled his blood.\n\nNot far away, and not far beneath him, a ghostly violet haze was\nspreading through the fog, and the fog itself was coiling back from it\nuntil it formed a dense white wall.\n\nFor a moment Jim's hand was paralysed upon the stick. The next, his\ndecision was made. He closed his throttle and went down in a slow\ndescent right toward the heart of that column of lavender smoke that\nseemed to be springing straight up out of the ground. \"A pillar of\nviolet fire!\" It could not have been described better.\n\nThe plane dived through the dense wall of fog, which for a moment shut\nout the violet fire completely. Then Jim was through, and almost\nimmediately beneath him lay the black and glassy surface of the pool.\nOut of the very heart of it rose the fire, burning like some infernal\nflame that consumed nothing, and between it and the fog was a space of\nalmost translucent air, extending to the borders of the pool.\n\nJim began to circle the pool to find a landing-place. But as he looked\ndown, the surface of the pool began to change its aspect.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn place of the unruffled calm, it began to work with some devil's\nyeast all around the central pillar of flame, until its depths seemed\nto be churned up in frothy masses and the movement extended almost to\nthe circumference. Then the whole surface of the water began to tilt\nand sway with a slow, shimmering, undulatory movement, as if it was a\ngiant roulette wheel in rotation.\n\nAnd something was materializing out of the heart of the violet flame\nitself.\n\nIt was a face--a human face, with bestial features, distorted and\nenormously magnified through the substance in which it was. Such a\nface as might look back upon an observer out of one of those\ndistorting mirrors at Coney Island, or some other place of popular\namusement, but twisted and enlarged beyond conception, so that it\ncovered half the area of a city block.\n\nCuriously blurred, too, as if each atom of that face was in isolated\nmotion on its own account. And beneath the face appeared the vague\noutlines of a hand, apparently manipulating some sort of infernal\nmechanism.\n\nAnd that face, enlarged as it was out of all proportion, filled Jim's\nheart with greater horror than any face he had ever known.\n\nFor it was the visage of Lucius Tode, and on those huge and distorted\nfeatures was something that looked like a diabolical smile.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEverything vanished. Jim was back in the surrounding wall of fog.\nInstinctively he banked again. He strove to drive the horror from his\nbrain. He must circle, circle incessantly, in the hope of finding\nLucille. She must have already arrived. But if she had not fallen\ninto Tode's power, she would hear the roaring of the plane and manage\nto signal him.\n\nHe circled back into the clear space between the white and the violet,\nand now he saw that the effect upon the pool was still more\npronounced. The waters were rising up in a rim all around, and yet not\noverflowing. They were standing up like a bowl of clay upon the\npotter's wheel, and down in the depths Jim could see the head and\nshoulders of Tode, much less magnified, more natural in appearance,\nand less blurred. And Tode was looking up at him and pointing that\ninfernal mechanism at him--something that looked like the tube of a\ntelescope.\n\nSuddenly the plane shivered and stood still. The motor died abruptly.\nThe stick went dead. And yet the plane did not fall. As if upheld by\nthe same repulsive force that drove back the white fog, it simply hung\nsuspended three hundred feet above the heart of the violet flame.\n\nThen--there was no longer any plane. The stick had melted in Jim's\nhand, the wings dissolved like wreaths of mist. The entire body had\ndisintegrated into nothingness. Jim sat suspended in the void, and\nfelt himself very slowly descending into the violet column.\n\nDown into the vortex of that bubbling pool, which rimmed him on all\nsides ... down into the central aperture out of which emerged the\nleering face of Tode! And as he dropped Jim heard, thin, faint, and\nvery far away, the despairing cry of Lucille....\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n_Old Friends--and Foes_\n\nJim must have lapsed into unconsciousness, for when he opened his eyes\nthere was a gap in his consciousness of the passage of time, though\nnone in his memory. He opened his eyes, and instantly he remembered\neverything.\n\nOnly a brief interval could have elapsed, for it was not quite dark.\nThe fog and the violet flame had cleared away. Overhead a few stars\ntwinkled. Jim was lying on his side, half-buried in the black, slimy\nmud of the dried up pool.\n\nThere was nothing but the smooth, shelving mud basin, with the scrub\noak surrounding it. Tode and the machine had vanished.\n\nJim pulled himself with an effort out of the sucking mud, and, heavily\nclogged with it, began to make his way toward the margin.\n\nStumbling, struggling through the viscid ooze, he shouted Lucille's\nname despairingly. But no answer came, and his cries only made the\nutter silence all about him seem more fearsome.\n\nExhausted by his efforts, he gained the edge of the pool at last, and\nstopped, trying to orientate himself. As he did so, he saw a human\nface peering at him out of a clump of scrub oak.\n\nIt was the face of an aged man, with a long white beard and rags of\nclothes that were festooned about him. Jim took a step toward it,\nshouting a challenge. Next moment it had hurled itself out of its\nshelter toward him, and two skeletonlike arms were twined about his\nshoulders, while the fingers worked upward toward his throat.\n\nThe face was that of a madman, crazed by fear. And Jim recognized it.\nIt was the face of Professor Parrish.\n\nParrish, the trim, immaculate, clean-shaven, urbane old man, whose\nlectures, imbued with wit and scholarship, had always been the delight\nof his classes--Parrish reduced to this gibbering maniac! And yet\nParrish himself, returned to the site of their experiments after five\nyears!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSo fierce was the old man's onset, so desperate his clutch, that for a\nhalf-minute or more Jim was reduced to fighting for his life. The\nclawing fingers, armed with long nails, furrowed Jim's throat, there\nwas a terrific strength in the body, wasted though it was almost to a\nskeleton.\n\nBut it was only for a half-minute that old Parrish's endurance lasted.\nSuddenly the old man went limp and tottered forward, dropped upon the\nground. Jim bent over him.\n\n\"Parrish, you know me! I'm Jim Dent!\" he cried. \"I came here to save\nyou.\"\n\nParrish was muttering something. Jim caught the words \"Tode,\" and \"God\nhelp Lucille!\"\n\n\"Parrish, I'm Jim Dent!\" Jim cried again, and the old man, shuddering,\nopened his eyes and recognized him.\n\n\"Jim!\" he muttered. \"Jim Dent! Then where is she? I got away from that\ndevil, found farmhouse empty, got telephone book, found her and\n'phoned her. Told her to come. Save--Lucille!\"\n\nHe fell back, his eyes closed. Jim crouched over the unconscious old\nman. He was in a state of utter perplexity. He could not quite gather\nwhat Parrish had been trying to tell him, and it was with difficulty\nthat he could focus his mind upon the situation, so great had been the\nshock of finding his former chief in that condition.\n\nWhat had become of his plane, and where was Lucille? Jim was positive\nthat he had heard her cry for help out of the vortex in the water.\n\nBut there was no water, only the circle of black mud extended in the\nstarlight.\n\nAgain and again Jim shouted Lucille's name, and his cries went echoing\naway through the scrub without result.\n\nJim looked down at the unconscious old man beside him. He must get\nParrish away, get him to Andy Lumm's. He bent over him again and\nraised him in his arms.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSuddenly he heard two familiar sounds behind him, two dull thumps that\nsounded less like explosions than echoes, long drawn out, and receding\ninto infinity. There was no other sound quite like them that he had\never heard.\n\nThey were the snap of the electrical discharge as the Atom Smasher\nbegan to operate, and why the snap had sounded like a heavy body\nfalling a long distance away, was not known.\n\nTode had said one day, with what Jim had taken for sarcasm, that they\nrepresented the wave series of a single sound extended in time to make\nfour-dimensional action, but Jim had never considered the explanation\nseriously.\n\nThat sound, bringing back all Jim's memories of their experiments,\nbrought him to his feet sharply. He swung around. The surface of the\npool was a bubbling, seething mass of mud and water. And over its\nsurface that faint violet haze was beginning to spread.\n\nIn the center where the light was thickest, something like a gyroscope\nappeared to be revolving. Out of the gyroscope something was beginning\nto project--that infernal tube of Lucius Tode. And Jim knew that in\nthe heart of the flame that enormous, distorted face of Lucius Tode\nwould again be visible.\n\nThe human nervous system can only endure a certain amount of impact.\nThe sight of that ghastly flame, already condensing into a violet\npillar, was more than Jim could stand. He dragged old Parrish to his\nfeet and started off with him into the thickest part of the\nundergrowth.\n\nA fearful scream behind him stopped him at the very edge of the scrub.\nHe looked back, still supporting the half-conscious old man in his\narms. The violet flame was shooting up in a straight pillar, the whole\ncentral portion of the pool was dry, and the waters were heaped up all\naround it.\n\nFrom the slightly elevated spot where Jim stood, he could see Tode\nholding Lucille in his arms in the very heart of the fire, which threw\na pale, fluorescent light over their faces. Tode was wearing a spotted\nskin, like that of a leopard, and Lucille was in the blue frock that\nshe had worn when Jim and she had dinner together two evenings\nbefore.\n\nJim dropped old Parrish, shouted in answer, and dashed back like a\nmadman down the slope into the solid wall of water.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe fought his way desperately through that wall, which seemed of the\nconsistency of soft rubber or treacle, as if some subtle change had\ntaken place in its molecular isomers. It adhered to him without\nwetting him, and he plunged through it, hearing Lucille cry out again,\nand yet again.\n\nAnd now he was through, and once more struggling over the viscid\nsurface of the pond. Behind him he heard old Parrish blundering, and\nscreeching at the top of his voice, but he paid no attention to him.\n\nHe could see Lucille more clearly, and the large, hazy outlines of\nTode's features were beginning to assume the proper proportions. There\nwas a diabolical leer upon Tode's face, unchanged during the five\nyears since Jim had seen him last, except that it had become more\nevil, more powerful. The enormous and distorted face that Jim had seen\nhad been simply due to the presence of some refracting medium.\n\nThe pillar of violet light was thinning, spreading out over the pool,\nbut Jim could now see the scene more clearly than before, even as he\nrushed onward.\n\nThe machine was inside what looked like a flat boat, but more circular\nthan a boat, and apparently was made of some metal resembling\naluminum. Either from the metal hull or from the mechanism inside it\nthere was emitted a pungent odor resembling chlorine.\n\nThe mechanism itself bore some resemblance to the old Atom Smasher of\nfive years before, but it appeared to be immensely more complicated.\nWheels of various sizes were set at every conceivable angle around the\ncentral tube, from which the violet light was emanating, and all were\nrotating and gyrating so fast that they looked like discs of light.\nThe boat itself was trembling, and this movement appeared to be\ncommunicated to the boiling mud in the central part of the pool.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs Jim tried to leap down through the sucking mud to snatch Lucille\nfrom Tode, the latter stopped, straightened himself, and pointed a\nshort tube at Jim's heart.\n\nJim felt as if an enormous, invisible force had struck him in the\nchest. It was apparently the same repulsive force that had driven back\nthe waters. The shock was not a violent one. It did not throw him off\nhis feet. It merely pushed him slowly and irresistibly backward.\n\nAnd the whole picture was beginning to fade. Etched sharply in the\nviolet light one moment, it now looked like a drawing that had been\ncovered with tissue paper.\n\nThe outlines were dissolving into a haze--or, rather, each line seemed\nreproduced an infinite number of times, as the edge of a vibrating saw\nshows an infinitude of edges. The violet fire was becoming still more\ndiffused. It hovered over the waters, a pale, flickering glow. And\nsimultaneously the walls of water began to break and come surging\nforward.\n\nJim saw Lucille stretching out her arms toward him, and tried to\nstruggle forward, but in vain. She cried out his name, and he put all\nhis strength into that desperate futile struggle to reach her. But he\nwas being borne backward by the invisible power in the tube. The\nrushing torrent was surging about his knees; grew waist deep: in\nanother moment Jim was swimming for his life against the furious\nflood.\n\nSuddenly, however, the tremendous pressure on his chest was relaxed.\nTode had turned the tube away from him. He was leaning forward out of\nthe boat and grasped old Parrish, who had been flung violently against\nit by the dissolving waters.\n\nThe same flood carried Jim to the boat's side. Here, however, the\nflood was only knee deep, owing to the repulsion still being exercised\nby the violet light, which was glimmering feebly. Jim found his feet\nand leaped into the craft. He grasped Lucille in his arms.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe turned to confront Tode, who had just dragged old Parrish over the\nside. The three men confronted one another.\n\n\"Turn that tube on me, and I'll jump into your damn machinery and bust\nit!\" Jim shouted.\n\nAn ironical expression came on Tode's face. It was clear that he still\nconsidered himself master of the situation. \"At the immediate moment,\nDent, the lives of all of us depend upon your keeping absolutely\nstill,\" he answered. \"Take my advice and sit down!\"\n\nJim saw Lucille's face, ghastly in the faint violet light that played\nabout it. The girl had fainted. She was lying unconscious, her feet\nagainst the circular metal plate that protected the machinery, her\nhead upon the rail that ran around the boat's upper edge. Tode,\nwithout waiting for Jim's answer, stepped over the plate and took his\nseat at a sort of instrument board with control levers and thumb\nscrews that apparently controlled the needles on four dials. He\ntouched a button, and instantly the violet light disappeared.\n\nWith its vanishing, the waves came surging forward, and lapped\nviolently against the hull, as if about to overwhelm the vessel,\nwhich, however, seemed immovable. It simply rose higher in the water.\n\nJim understood the cause of this. Those gyroscopes would retain the\nhull in the same position against anything but a mechanical force\nstrong enough to ruin it. He watched Tode as he sat at the instrument\nboard, which was illuminated by two tiny lights of what looked like\nmercury-vapor. His face, handsome and cruel as ever, was tense as he\nmanipulated the thumb screws. Beside him lay Parrish, faintly\nwhimpering. The old man had evidently abandoned all hope of effecting\nhis escape, or of rescuing his daughter.\n\nIt was unbearable to have to sit there, knowing that the three of\nthem were absolutely at Tode's mercy, and yet there was nothing else\nto do.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTode looked up with a saturnine smile. \"It's a delicate operation to\nblur the present without shooting out a hundred years or so in time,\"\nhe said, \"but my micrometer's pretty accurate, Dent. Don't move, I\ncaution you!\" He smiled again. \"Yes, Dent, time is something like the\nfourth dimension of space, as we believed in the old days, and I've\nproved it.\"\n\nJim saw Tode touch the screw that controlled the fourth dial, and\ninstantly it was borne in on him that each of the dials controlled one\nspatial dimension. This fourth, then, was the time dimension!\n\nCould it be true that Tode had solved the practical problem of\ntraveling in time, theoretically implied since the discoveries of\nEinstein?\n\nHe had known in the old days that the Atom Smasher might be adapted to\nthis purpose, but neither Parrish nor he had dreamed of turning aside\nfrom their endeavor to utilize it for the purpose of releasing atomic\nenergy.\n\nThump! Thump! The familiar old sound, rushing back into memory after\nall those years, the release of the electrical discharge, echoing\nthrough infinity! The scrub around the pool blurred and was gone. A\nvast gray panorama extended itself on either side of them.\n\nThey were travelling--in space--and time too. Jim no longer doubted.\nAnd, chilled with horror, he sat there, his arm about Lucille's\nunconscious form.\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n_Into the Infinite_\n\nHow long he sat there he did not know. Minutes or hours seemed all the\nsame to him. Nothing but that gray monochrome, of neither light nor\ndarkness, that endless panorama of miles and years, blended together\ninto this chaos!\n\nBut suddenly there came a shout from Tode. The blur ceased, the lights\nflickered. Again there sounded the two thumps of the electrical\ndischarge. The vibrating mechanism grew steady. Above them, out of the\ngrayness, a moon disclosed itself, then the pin-points of stars. All\nabout them was an immense, sandy waste.\n\n\"Know where we are, Dent?\" came Tode's chuckle.\n\nJim was not sufficiently master of himself to attempt to answer.\n\n\"We are on what will be the Russian steppes some fifty thousand years\nahead of us in time,\" grinned Tode. \"This is an interlude between two\nice ages. Observe how pleasantly warm the climate is, for Russia.\nUnfortunately the receding glaciers carried off the top-soil, which\naccounts for the barrenness of the district, but in another century\nthis country will be overgrown with ferns, and inhabited by the\nmastodon and wild horse, and a few enterprising palaeolithic hunters,\nwho will come in to track them down and destroy them with their stone\naxes.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I think you're the same sort of damn liar you always were, Tode,\"\nanswered Jim--but without conviction. There was something terrific\nabout that desolation. Nothing within a thousand miles of Long Island\ncorresponded to it.\n\n\"You'll be convinced pretty quickly, when you see my specimen,\"\nanswered Tode. \"I let him off here on the way to the pool. He's not\nexactly presentable, and when I got the idea of picking up Lucille and\ntaking her back with me, I thought it best not to let her see him. He\ndidn't want to be let off. Was afraid I wouldn't pick him up again,\nand I'll admit it was a matter of pretty careful reckoning. But this\nis the place, almost to the yard.\n\n\"Yes, I've done some close reckoning, Dent, but the cleverest part of\nthe business was letting old Parrish think he'd got away from me. I\nknew he'd telephone Lucille. You know, I always had the brains of the\noutfit, Dent,\" he continued, with a smirk of self-satisfaction.\n\nHe looked out of the boat. \"And here, if I'm not mistaken, comes my\nspecimen,\" he added.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSomething was running across the steppes toward them. It came nearer,\ntook human form. It was human! A man--but such a man as Jim had never\nseen before outside the covers of a book. And he recognised the race\nimmediately.\n\nIt was a Neanderthal man, one of the race that co-existed with the\nhighly developed Cro-Magnons some thirty thousand years ago. Man and\nnot ape, though the face was bestial, and there were huge ridges above\nthe eyebrows.\n\nAnd if Jim had needed conviction, the sight of this gibbering\ncreature, now climbing into the boat and fawning upon Tode, convinced\nhim. For the Neanderthal man vanished from the scene long before the\nbeginning of recorded history.\n\nFor a few moments a deathly faintness overcame him ... his eyes\nclosed, he felt unconsciousness rushing in upon him like a black\ncloud.\n\n\"It's all right, Dent--don't look so scared!\" came Tode's mocking\nvoice.\n\nJim opened his eyes, shook off that cloud of darkness with an immense\neffort. The boat was throbbing violently as the wheels gyrated, the\nviolet light had become a pillar as thick as a man, and shot straight\nup to a height of fifty feet, before it rolled away. Lucille was lying\nwhere she had been, her eyes still staring up unseeing at the stars.\nOld Parrish was whining and whimpering as he crouched in his place.\n\nAnd at Tode's feet crouched the Neanderthal man, repulsive, bestial,\neven though hardly formidable, and filling the last vacant spot inside\nthe boat. He was gibbering and mouthing as he fawned upon Tode and\npressed his hand to his hairy face. He continued to crouch and looked\nup at his master with doglike eyes.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRepulsive, and yet man, not ape. Distinctly human, perhaps a little\nlower than the Australian aborigine, the Neanderthal showed by his\nreverence that the human faculty of worship existed in him.\n\n\"Meet Cain, one of my Drilgoes,\" said Tode, with a grin. \"A faithful\nservant. I left him here to wait for me on the return journey. Cain's\njust my pet name for him because he subsists on the fruits of the\nearth, don't you, Cain?\"\n\nThe Drilgo grunted, and pressed Tode's hand to his repulsive lips,\nwhich were fringed with a reddish beard. Suddenly Tode began to laugh\nuproariously. \"Feel anything wrong with your head, Dent?\" he asked.\n\nDent put up his hand and pulled away a quantity of charred hair. His\nforehead began to itch, and, rubbing his finger across it, he realized\nthat his eyebrows were gone. Tode laughed still louder.\n\n\"You've kept your teeth by about two seconds' grace, Dent, but I\nshouldn't be surprised if you needed dental attention shortly,\" he\nsaid. \"What a pity dentists won't be invented for another forty or\nfifty thousand years.\"\n\n\"You're a devil!\" cried Jim.\n\n\"You see, the human body is very resistant to the Ray,\" Tode went on.\n\"It almost seems as if there is an organizing principle within it.\nEven the animal tissues are resistant, though not to the same extent\nas the human ones. It takes about twenty seconds for the organized\nhuman form to be disintegrated. But hair and beaks and claws, being\nsuperficial matter, vanish almost as soon as the Ray is turned on\nthem. Ten seconds more, and you'd have been obliterated, Dent, just as\nyour plane was.\n\n\"Yes, rub your head. Your hair will probably grow again--if I decide\nto let you live. It rather depends upon what impression you make upon\nLucille as a bald-headed hero. After all, I didn't invite you to\naccompany us. It's your own lookout.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJim could find nothing to say to that. He was discovering more and\nmore that they were all helpless in Tode's hands.\n\n\"Sit back!\" snarled Tode suddenly. He gave the Drilgo a push that sent\nhim sprawling into the bottom of the boat. \"Dent, your life depends\nupon your absolute acquiescence to my proposals. I didn't like you\nparticularly in the old days, any more than you liked me. I thought\nyou were a fool. On the other hand, I've no active reason to hate you,\nat present. It may be that I can use you.\n\n\"Meanwhile we've got a longish journey before us, ten thousand years\nmore, multiplied by the fourth power of two thousand miles. Seems\nsimple? Well, I had to invent the mathematical process for it. Reckon\nin the gravitational attraction of the planets, and you'll begin to\nget an idea of the complexity of it. So, in vulgar parlance, we're not\nlikely to arrive till morning.\"\n\nHe glanced at Lucille, who was still lying unconscious with Jim's arm\nabout her. Then his eyes rose to meet Jim's, and a sneering smile\nplayed about his lips. That smile was the acknowledgment of their\nrivalry for the girl's affections. And it was more--it was a\nchallenge.\n\nTode welcomed that rivalry because, Jim could see, he meant to keep\nhim alive under conditions of servitude, to demonstrate to Lucille his\nsuperiority.\n\nTode turned his thumbscrews, and the two thuds resounded. The violet\ncolumn sank down, the boat vibrated, the level stretch of land became\na blur again. The moon and stars vanished. Once more the four were off\non that terrific journey.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt first they seemed to be traversing space that was shot through by\nalternate light and darkness, so that at times Jim could see the other\noccupants of the boat clearly, while at other times there was only\nTode visible at the instrument board, with the dark outlines of the\nDrilgo, Cain, sprawled at his feet. But soon these streaks seemed to\ncome closer and closer together, until the duration of each was only a\nfraction of a second. And closer, until light and darkness blended\ninto a universal gray. These, Jim knew, were the alternations of night\nand day.\n\nThey were traveling--incredible as it was--in time as well as space,\nthough whether backward or forward Jim could not know. From the\npresence of the Neanderthal man, however, Jim was convinced that Tode\nwas taking them back more thousands of years, into the beginnings of\nhumanity.\n\nA fearful journey! A madder journey than Jim could have conceived of,\nhad he not been a participant in it. He was losing all sense of\nreality. He was hardly convinced that he would not awaken in New York,\nto discover that the whole episode had been a dream.\n\nWas this Lucille, the girl he loved ... with whom he had dined in New\nYork only a day or two before ... this unconscious form, stretched out\non the deck of the weird ship that was rushing through eternity? Or,\nrather, it was they who were rushing through space and time upon a\nstationary ship! What was reality, and what was dream, then?\n\nTode called \"Come over here, Dent! I want to talk to you!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJim picked his way over the metal floor of the round boat, came up to\nTode, and sat down beside him above the sprawling form of the Drilgo,\nCain.\n\n\"You were a fool to come here, Dent.\" Tode turned with a malicious\nsmile from his seat at the instrument board. \"You didn't have to come.\nI take it that you are in love with Lucille, you poor imbecile, and\nstill cherish dreams of winning her. We'll take up that matter in due\ncourse.\n\n\"Do you think I've been idle during these five years of my exile? I've\nbeen too busy even to come back for the woman I was in love with. And\ndo you know what I've been doing during all this hellish period?\nCharting courses, Dent! Mapping out all the planetary movements back\nfor uncounted ages--roughly, crudely, of course, but the best I was\nable to. These are difficult seas to navigate, though they may not\nseem so. You fool,\" he added savagely, \"why didn't you come in with me\nin the old days? I told you that the Atom Smasher could be used to\ntravel through time, and you mocked at me as a dreamer.\n\n\"I chose my hour. When everything was ready, I set forth on the most\ndesperate journey ever attempted by man. Talk of Columbus!--he had\nnothing on me. I tell you, Dent, I've been back to the Archaean Age,\nback to the time when nothing but crawling worms moved on the face of\nthe earth. And I've been forward to the time when an errant planet\nwill disrupt the earth into a shower of lava--and I nearly wrecked the\nboat. Dent.\n\n\"I've won, Dent! I've won! I've solved the problem that gives man\nimmortality! All the epochs that have existed since God first formed\nthe world are mine to play with! I have seen myself as a puling\ninfant, and as a greybeard. I have made myself immortal, because, with\nthis machine, I can set back the clock of time. I have found a land\nwhere I am worshipped as a god.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTode's eyes glittered with maniacal fires. He went on in a voice of\nindescribable triumph:\n\n\"I'm a god there, Dent. Do you want to know where that land is? It is\nAtlantis, sunk beneath the waves nine thousand years before recorded\nhistory opened. It is Atlantis, from which the Cro-Magnons fled in\ntheir ships, to land on the coasts of Spain and France, and become the\nancestors of modern man.\n\n\"In old Atlantis, still not wholly submerged, I have made myself a\ngod. I have mastered the savage Drilgoes whom the Atlanteans\noppressed. All the spoils of their ruined cities are at my disposal.\nAnd I came back to get Lucille, whom I had never ceased to love.\nTogether Lucille and I will rule like god and goddess.\n\n\"Join me, Dent. I'm a god in Atlantis--a god, I tell you. The lesser\nraces fear me as a supernatural being. Only the city remains\nuncaptured, but it is mine whenever I choose to take it. A god--a\ngod--a god!\"\n\nJim saw now what he had not realized before, that Tode was insane. It\nwould, indeed, have been a miracle if he had been able to retain his\nsanity under such circumstances as he had described. His voice rose\ninto a wild scream. Yes, Tode was mad--just such a madman as any of\nthe old Roman emperors, drunk with power, each in his turn the sole\nruler of the world.\n\n\"The Earth is mine!\" Tode screamed. \"Before the modern world was\ndreamed of, before the nations were created, Atlantis was the sole\npower that held dominion over the scattered tribes of mankind. And she\nis in my hand whenever I strike.\n\n\"Wealth incalculable, treasures such as man has never since seen,\nmarvels of scientific discovery, flying machines that would make ours\nlook foolish, paintings grander than have since been executed--all\nthese things exist in the proud city that will shortly be at my\ncommand. And I have my Drilgoes, the inferior race, to serve me. They\nworship me because they know I am a god. Join me, Dent, and taste the\njoys of being one of the supreme rulers of the world.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn spite of his undoubted madness, there was such power in Tode's\nvoice that Jim could not help believe what he had said.\n\n\"Well,\" snarled Tode. \"You hesitate to give me your answer, Dent?\"\n\n\"Lucille and I are engaged to be married,\" answered Jim, and the words\nwere drawn from his lips almost against his will. \"We love each other.\nI am not going to lie to you and then betray you, Tode.\"\n\nThe expression on Tode's face was demoniacal. He snatched up the\ndeadly tube that contained the violet fire and turned it upon Jim.\nAgain Jim felt that repulsive force pushing him back. He gasped for\nbreath, and tensed his whole body in supreme resistance, while he\ntried to grapple with Tode in vain.\n\nBut suddenly Tode dropped the tube, and a roar of laughter broke from\nhis lips.\n\n\"You fool!\" he shouted. \"I tell you I am a god, the one god, supreme\nabove all. Do you think to match your puny will against my own? I tell\nyou Lucille is mine. And for ever, Dent. Whenever we two have reached\nold age, all that will be necessary for us to do will be to turn this\nscrew a hair's breadth back into the past, and we are both young\nagain. By holding this vessel steady in four-dimensional space, I can\nachieve immortality.\"\n\n\"Yes, Tode,\" answered Jim, \"but, you see, that's the one thing that\nyou haven't been able to work out yet.\"\n\nThe words seemed to come automatically from Jim's lips. It was only\nafter he had spoken them that he realized they were true. For a moment\nTode glared at him; then suddenly, with a shriek of insane rage, he\nleaped from the instrument board and swung the ray tube with all his\nmight.\n\nJim felt the blow descend with stunning force upon his head. He\nreeled, flung out his arms, and toppled forward, unconscious....\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n_Escape_\n\nAn intolerably bright light that seemed to sear his eyeballs was the\nfirst thing of which Jim was conscious. Then he became aware of his\naching head, of a sense of utter lassitude, as if he had been bruised\nall over in some machine that had caught him up and held him in its\ngrip for endless aeons.\n\nAt last, despite the pain in his eyes, he managed to get his eyelids\nopen. He tried to struggle to his feet, only to discover that he was\nfirmly bound with what appeared to be tough creepers, pliant as ropes.\n\nAfter the lapse of a few minutes, during which he struggled with the\nreceding waves of unconsciousness, he came to a realization of his\nsurroundings. That light that had so distressed him--though the\neffects were now beginning to pass off--was a pillar of smoke and\nflame, shooting out of the crater of a volcano about a mile away,\nacross a valley.\n\nHe was lying in the entrance to a cave, pegged out on his back, and\nbound by the tough creepers to the stakes driven into the ground. Up\nto the mouth of the cave grew huge tree-ferns, cattails, cycads, and\nsuch growths as existed in earlier ages in the warm, moist regions of\nthe world.\n\nBeneath the level of the cave a heavy white fog completely shrouded\nthe valley, extending up to within a short distance of the volcano\nopposite. But on the upper slopes of the volcano the sunlight played,\nmaking its crater a sheen of glassy lava, intolerably bright.\n\nBeyond the volcano Jim could see what looked like an expanse of ocean.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe groaned, and at the sound a creature came shambling forward,\ncarrying what looked like a huge melon in either hand. Jim recognized\nthe Drilgo, Cain.\n\nChattering and mumbling, Cain placed one of the fruits to Jim's mouth.\nIt was a sort of bread-fruit, but he was too nauseated to eat, and\nrejected it with disgust. Cain offered him the second fruit.\n\nIt was a hollow gourd, the interior filled with a clear fluid. Jim\ndrank greedily as the Drilgo put it to his lips. The contents were\nlike water, but slightly acid. Jim felt refreshed. He looked about\nhim.\n\nThe Drilgo uttered a chattering call, and immediately a host of the\nsavages swarmed into the cave. Men--undoubtedly men, in spite of the\nbrow ridges and the receding foreheads, carrying long spears,\nconsisting of chipped and pointed heads of stone, with holes bored in\nthem, through which long bands of creepers passed, fastening them\nfirmly to the shaft.\n\nChattering and gesticulating, the Drilgoes surrounded Jim as he lay\nhelpless on the ground. Their savage faces, their rolling eyes, the\nthreatening gestures that they made with their spears, convinced Jim\nthat his end was a foregone conclusion.\n\nBut suddenly a distant rumbling sound was heard, increasing rapidly in\nvolume. The floor of the cave vibrated; masses of rock dropped from\nthe walls. The light of the volcano across the valley was suddenly\nobscured in an immense cloud of black smoke. The twilight within the\ncave was succeeded by almost impenetrable darkness.\n\nShrieking in terror, the Drilgoes bolted, while Jim lay straining at\nhis ropes, expecting each moment to be crushed by the masses of rock\nthat were falling all about him.\n\nSuddenly a soft whisper came to Jim through the darkness: \"Jim! Are\nyou safe! Where are you? I can't see you! Speak to me!\"\n\nIt was Lucille's voice, and Jim called back, husky and tremulous in\nthe sheer joy that had succeeded his anticipation of instant death.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen he felt the girl kneeling at his side, and heard her hacking at\nhis bonds. A whole minute passed before the stone knife was able to\nsever the last of the stout withes, however.\n\nThen Jim was swaying on his feet, and Lucille's arms were about him,\nand for a few moments their fears were forgotten in the renewal of\ntheir love.\n\n\"I heard what that devil said to you last night,\" the girl said. \"He\nmeans to kill you with awful tortures. He is away now, on some task or\nother, but he'll be back at any moment. We must get away at once--we\nthree. Dad's in another cave not far away, and his guards bolted after\nthe earthquake.\"\n\nThe earth was still rumbling, and the cavern still vibrating, but it\nwas clear that there was no time to lose. As soon as the quake\nsubsided the Drilgoes would return. Guided by Lucille, Jim groped his\nway through the cavern. The girl called softly at intervals, and\npresently Jim heard old Parrish's answering call. Then the old man's\nform appeared in silhouette against the dark.\n\n\"I've got Jim,\" Lucille whispered. \"Are you ready, dad?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, I'm ready,\" chattered the old man. \"Now's our chance. I\nknow a place where we can hide in the thick forests, where the Ray of\nthe Atlanteans cannot penetrate the mists. Let's go! Let's go!\"\n\nGripping hands, the three started back toward the point where a faint\npatch of darkness showed out the entrance to the cavern. They were\nnearing it when another and more violent shock flung them upon their\nfaces.\n\nHuge masses of rock came hurtling down from the roof and sides of the\ncavern, and again the three seemed to escape by a miracle.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSuddenly a huge shaft of fire shot from the crater opposite, evolving\ninto an inverted cone that made the whole land dazzlingly bright. It\npierced the mists in the valley underneath, and by that light Jim\ncould see a great wave of lava streaming down the mountain sides, like\nsoup spilled out of a bowl.\n\nA gush of black smoke followed, and the light went out.\n\n\"Now!\" gasped Parrish, and, clinging to one another, the three darted\nout of the cavern's entrance. Another terrific shock sent them\nstumbling and reeling and sprawling down the side of the mountain. Jim\nheard old Parrish wailing, and, as the shock subsided, groped his way\nto his side.\n\n\"You hurt?\" he shouted.\n\n\"Lucille, Lucille,\" moaned the old man. \"She's dead! A big rock\ncrushed her. I wish I was dead too.\"\n\nJim called Lucille's name frantically, and to his immense relief\nheard her crying faintly out of the darkness. He rushed to her side\nand held her in his arms.\n\n\"Where are you hit, darling?\"\n\n\"I'm--all right,\" she panted. \"I was stunned for a moment. I--can--go\non now.\"\n\nBut she went limp in Jim's arms, and Jim picked her up and stood\nirresolute, until he heard Parrish shambling toward him over the\nheaving ground.\n\n\"She's not hurt, I think, only fainted,\" said Jim. \"Which way,\nParrish? You lead us.\"\n\n\"Down the slope,\" panted Parrish. \"We'll be in the ferns in a minute.\nWe can hide there for a while, till she's able to walk. God help us\nall! And I was once Professor of Physical Chemistry at Columbia!\"\n\nThe outcry might have seemed comical under other circumstances; as it\nwas, Jim heartily re-echoed old Parrish's sentiments in his heart.\n\nThe last shock was subsiding in faint earth tremors. The two men\nplunged down into the heavy fog, which quickly covered them, Jim\ncarrying Lucille in his arms. He felt the ferny undergrowth all about\nhim, the thick boles of tree-ferns emerged out of the mist.\n\n\"We can stop here for a while,\" panted Parrish. \"Crouch down! They'll\nnever find us in this fog, and in a few minutes, when Lucille's\nbetter, we can go on.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You must tell me where we are and what our chances are,\" said Jim,\nafter again ascertaining that Lucille was unharmed.\n\n\"I'll tell you, Dent, as quick as I can. It's the place where I've\nspent five years of hell as the slave of that devil, Tode. I never\ndreamed, when we were working on the old Atom Smasher, that he had\nadapted it to travel in the fourth dimension. He's taken us back\ntwelve thousand years or so to the island of Atlantis. History hasn't\nbegun yet. Atlantis is the only civilization in the world. The rest\nare Drilgoes, Neanderthal men, wandering in the forests, and still in\ntheir stone age.\n\n\"It's true, Dent, what old Plato learned from the Egyptian priests.\nAtlantis has been slowly sinking for thousands of years, and all\nthat's left now is the one great island that we're on. Nearly all the\nAtlanteans, the Cro-Magnon men, have perished, except for a few who\nhave crossed in ships to the coasts of France and Spain. They'll be\nthe founders of modern Europe--Basques and Iberians, and Bretons and\nWelshmen. Our ancestors! It makes my brain reel to think of it!\"\n\n\"Go on! Go on!\" said Jim.\n\n\"There's a great city on the island, known as Atlantis too. As big as\nLondon or New York. With flying-machines and temples and art galleries\nand big ships that they're building to carry them away when the next\nsubsidence comes. They know they're doomed, for every few days there's\nan eruption now.\n\n\"Tode means to make himself master of Atlantis, and transport it into\nanother epoch by means of the Atom Smasher. But he's never managed to\nenter. He's made himself a god in the eyes of the Drilgoes, the\nsavages who inhabit these forests. He's planning to lead them against\nthe city, and he's got an army of thousands from all parts of the\ninterior, who worship him as divine.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"The Atlanteans are unwarlike. They've forgotten how to fight in their\nthousands of years of peace. But they've got a Ray ten times as strong\nas Tode's, that brings instant death to everything it touches. It\nshrivels it up. It's a different principle. I don't understand it, but\nit's this Ray that keeps the Drilgoes from capturing the city.\n\n\"Tode's got a laboratory inside the cave, fitted up with apparatus\nthat he brought from Chicago, the world capital of the year 3000 A.\nD., after disintegrating the atoms and recombining them. But he hasn't\nsucceeded altogether. He hasn't learned everything. The future isn't\nquite clear, like the past. There's a dark cloud moves across the\nspectral lines and blurs them. I think it's the element of free\nwill--or God!\"\n\n\"I know,\" Jim answered. \"He can't hold that boat steady in\nfour-dimensional space, as he pretends he can. If he could, it would\nmean that man was wholly master of his destiny. He can't and he never\nwill.\n\n\"There's an unknown quantity comes in, Parrish. It is God, and that's\nwhat's going to beat him in the end.\"\n\n\"I've not been as idle as Tode thinks,\" said Parrish, with a senile\nleer. \"I know more about the Atom Smasher than he dreams of. He thinks\nme just an old fool, the remnants of whose brains are useful to him in\nhis laboratory. That's why he's kept me alive so far. He'll find out\nhis mistake,\" he chuckled. \"I have something Tode doesn't dream of.\"\n\nSuddenly Parrish's air of intense seriousness vanished. He chuckled\nand fumbled in his rags. Jim felt a small object like a lever pressed\ninto his hand and then withdrawn.\n\n\"It's death, Dent,\" chuckled old Parrish. \"The concentrated essence of\nthe destructive principle. It's a lever I fitted into a concealed\ngroove in the Atom Smasher unknown to Tode. This lever has a universal\njoint and connects with a hidden chamber, and when pulled will\ncatapult the annihilated components of a small quantity of uranium in\nany direction we desire. The release of the slumbering energy of this\nuranium will produce an explosion of proportions beyond the wildest\ndreams of engineers--perhaps, one great enough to throw the Earth out\nof its orbit!\"\n\n\"Uranium!... Breaking up its components!\" gasped Jim. \"You mean you\ncan actually do that?\"\n\n\"Yes!\" chuckled Parrish. \"I'm keeping it for the day when Tode becomes\na god. When he's steadied the boat in time-space and halted the march\nof the past, and when he's got Lucille--then, Dent, I shall so pull\nthe lever that it will release the energy straight at Tode--and\ndestroy the Atom-Smasher, ourselves, and even, perhaps, the whole\nEarth!\"\n\nAnd he burst into a peal of such wild laughter that Jim realized the\nold man's wits were gone.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWas it true, that amazing story? It was difficult to know, and yet\nanything seemed possible in this amazing world into which Jim had\nsuddenly been thrown.\n\nThe vast pall of smoke cast out by the volcano was beginning to\nsubside. Slowly a spectral light began to filter through the valley.\nThrough the fog Jim could see glimpses of the ferny undergrowth, the\ngiant tree-ferns and cycads that towered aloft. It was like a picture\nof the earth when the mastodons, the grass-eaters and the meat-eaters\ndisputed for its supremacy.\n\nJim bent over Lucille. He saw her stir, he heard her murmur his name.\nSuddenly she sat up, fixed her eyes on his, and shuddered.\n\n\"I'm all right, Jim. Let's go,\" she said. \"I can walk now.\"\n\nShe staggered to her feet. Jim put out his hand to support her, but\nshe shook her head. Jim touched old Parrish on the arm. He started and\nuttered a wild screech; then seemed to come to himself and rose.\n\nBut that screech of his was re-echoed from the mountainside above.\nOther voices took up the echoes. Lucille clutched at Jim in a frenzy\nof fear.\n\n\"The Drilgoes!\" she whispered. \"They're on our trail!\"\n\nSeizing old Parrish by the arm, Jim started to drag him into the\nrecesses of the fern forest. Suddenly the bestial face of a Drilgo\nappeared.\n\nA yell broke from the man's throat. The hairy arm shot back. Jim saw\nthe stone tip of the long spear poised overhead. He leaped forward,\ndelivering a blow in the man's midriff with all the strength of his\nright arm.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Drilgo grunted and doubled forward, the spear falling from his\nhand. The heavy head of stone embedded itself in the soft ground, so\nthat the spear remained upright. As the man collapsed he yelled at the\ntop of his voice.\n\n\"This way! This way!\" gibbered old Parrish, suddenly alert.\n\nBut now the undergrowth all about them was alive with Drilgoes. The\nthree dodged and doubled like hunted hares. High overhead something\nbegan to clack with a sound like that made by a woodpecker drilling a\ntree, but infinitely louder.\n\nAnd out of the void above came Tode's voice, shouting commands to the\nDrilgoes in their own language.\n\nSuddenly a column of fire shot up from the volcano, infusing the white\nmists with a reddish glare. Overhead the three could see Tode. He was\nflying with a pair of mechanical wings strapped to his shoulders, not\nmore than two hundred feet above them. With a shout of triumph he\nswooped down. In his hand was a small cylinder, about the mouth of\nwhich a phosphorescent violet light was beginning to play.\n\n\"I've got you, Dent,\" he screamed in triumph, hovering above the\nthree, while the wings drummed and vibrated till they seemed the mere\nplay of light and shadow about Tode's shoulders. \"Halt, or I'll blast\nyour body and soul to hell! Halt, or I'll kill _her_!\"\n\nThe deadly tube was pointing steadily at Lucille's body as Tode\nhovered ten feet overhead, perfectly still save for the whirring\nwings. The three stopped dead, and Tode, with a shout of triumph,\nbegan calling the Drilgoes, who swarmed forward out of the\nundergrowth.\n\nHuge brown bodies, nude save for their skins of jungle-cat or serpent,\nthey emerged, quickly forming a ring about the three prisoners. Tode\nfluttered to the ground.\n\n\"Fools, did you think you could escape that way?\" he asked. \"As for you,\nDent. I'm going to convince you of the reality of four-dimensional space\nas you would not be convinced in the old days. Do you know what I'm going\nto do with you? I'm going to strip the skin from you with the ray, and\ntake you into the anatomical room at Columbia University and leave you\nthere as an exhibit, Dent!\"\n\nTode grinned like a madman. But Jim was looking past him, at something\nthat had suddenly appeared upon the far horizon.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a round disc of bluish white, a disc like the moon, but\nslightly smaller, a disc that flickered as if it had an eyelid that\nwas being winked repeatedly. Simultaneously screams broke from the\nthroats of all the Drilgoes. They stampeded.\n\nTode whirled about and saw. With a curse he leaped into the air and\nwhirred away.\n\nOut of that disc a slender, blue-white beam shot suddenly, driving a\npathway through the fog, and disclosing the dark depths of the valley.\n\n\"The Eye! The Eye!\" screeched Parrish. \"Down on the ground! Down!\nDown!\"\n\nHe dropped, and Jim caught Lucille and flung himself headlong with\nher. To and fro overhead, but only a few feet above them, moved the\nsearchlight. Shrieks broke from the Drilgoes' throats as they\nscattered through the jungle.\n\nEverywhere that ray moved, trees and undergrowth simply disappeared. A\nbunch of Drilgoes, caught by it, were obliterated in an instant. Great\ngaps were left through the undergrowth as the ray passed.\n\nIt faded as quickly as it had come, and instantly old Parrish was on\nhis feet, dragging at his daughter.\n\n\"Now! Now!\" he babbled, heading along one of the burned tracks through\nthe undergrowth.\n\nJim seized Lucille and the two raced in the wake of old Parrish.\nBehind them they could hear the Drilgoes shouting, but a dense,\nimpenetrable darkness was already beginning to settle down over the\nvalley. They lost the track and went crashing through the ferns, on\nand on until all was silence about them.\n\nSuddenly Parrish went down like a log. He lay breathing heavily,\ncompletely exhausted. When Jim spoke to him a feeble muttering was the\nonly answer. Jim and Lucille dropped to the ground exhausted beside\nhim.\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n_The Eye of Atlantis_\n\nFor perhaps half an hour the three lay there, hearing nothing. It\nseemed to be night, for the darkness was impenetrable, save for the\nlurid flashes of fire from the volcano. Parrish, who was slowly\nrecovering his strength, was mumbling incessantly. It was with\ndifficulty that Jim recalled him to a realization of his surroundings.\n\n\"Where is the city of Atlantis?\" he asked him.\n\n\"Over there,\" mumbled Parrish. \"Behind the volcano. Why do you ask\nme?\"\n\n\"I'm thinking of going there.\"\n\n\"Eh? Going there? You're mad. The Eye will see you, the Eye that can\nsee for a hundred miles. They'll turn the Ray on you. Nothing is too\nsmall for the Eye. And they watch night and day.\"\n\n\"The Eye is off now.\"\n\n\"It's never off. The Eye is dark. It grows white only when they are\nabout to use the Ray. Perhaps the Eye is watching us now.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" said Jim, \"I think we would do well to try to enter\nthe city. We can't live here in the jungle at the mercy of these\nDrilgoes.\"\n\n\"It is impossible to enter. All strangers are killed by the\nAtlanteans.\"\n\n\"Dad,\" interposed Lucille, \"I think we'd better do what Jim suggests.\nOne of us must decide.\"\n\n\"My idea is that you take us to some place where we can get a view of\nthe city,\" said Jim. \"Then we can make up our minds what to do. We've\ngot to get somewhere out of this jungle.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nParrish rose to his feet, mumbling. \"If we go round the base of the\nvolcano we can see Atlantis,\" he said. \"It's always light there. In\nthe daytime they drive away the fogs by some means they've got, and at\nnight they have an artificial sun. But we'll be killed, we'll all be\nkilled.\"\n\nMumbling and muttering, he began groping his way through the\nundergrowth in the direction of the volcano, whose flashes were again\nbecoming more frequent, affording a means of directing their route.\nObscure rumblings were again beginning to shake the earth. For an hour\nthe three picked their way steadily upward through the ferns, until\nthe ground became more open.\n\nThey were approaching the base of the volcano, whose side now towered\nabove them, the upper part glassy with vitreous lava.\n\nSuddenly Parrish, who was still leading, stopped and began to tremble\nwith fear. Stepping to his side, Jim heard the low muttering of voices\nnot far away.\n\nVery cautiously he moved forward through the thin fern scrub, until\nthe glow of burning embers caught his sight. He stopped, hearing the\nvoices more distinctly, and again moved forward.\n\nThree Drilgoes, huge, bestial men, and evidently an outpost, were\nsquatting around the ashes, devouring something with noisy gusto.\n\nSoftly as Jim had moved, their acute ears had caught the sound of his\nfootsteps. They rose, still holding what they were eating in their\nhands, and, grasping their stone spears, moved in three separate ways\ntoward the edge of the clearing.\n\nThe man nearest Jim uttered a guttural exclamation and, after sniffing\na moment, began to lope in his direction. Suddenly he stopped short,\npetrified with astonishment and fear at the sight of a man who,\ninstinct told him, was neither Atlantean nor of his own kind.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJim leaped, tackling him about the knees, and brought him heavily to\nthe ground. As the Drilgo fell, the spear clattered from his hand, but\nfrom his snakeskin girdle he pulled a long, curved knife of chipped\nobsidian, sharp as a razor.\n\nJim grasped the Drilgo's wrist, but in a moment he saw that he was no\nmatch for the creature in strength. He drew back his right arm and\ndelivered a punch to the solar plexus with all his strength.\n\nAs the Drilgo's hand grew limp he snatched away the knife. There was\nno helping what he did for the two others were close upon him.\n\nA thrust, a slashing blow, and the Drilgo was weltering in his\nlife-blood. A backward leap, and Jim evaded the flung spear by a\nhair's breadth.\n\nKnife in hand he leaped forward, and, dodging in beneath the long\nshaft of the weapon, got in a slash that almost cut the Drilgo's body\nin two.\n\nThe third Drilgo, seeing his two companions in their death-throes,\nflung away his spear and fled with loud howls into the jungle.\n\nJim stepped back. Lucille and her father were already almost at his\nheels. \"It's all right,\" he called. \"Come this way!\" He led them\nthrough the ferny growth in such a manner that they should not see the\ntwo dead bodies. Nevertheless, he felt that Lucille knew.\n\n\"Let's see what they were cooking,\" he said.\n\nBut again he turned quickly. He could not know for sure what flesh\nthat was, roasting and scorching on the embers, and he had no desire\nto know. It might have been monkey, but ... he turned away, and as he\ndid so, Parrish picked up several round objects that were lying a\nlittle distance away.\n\n\"These are good to eat,\" he said. \"A sort of bread-fruit. I've lived\non it for five years,\" he added with a sort of grotesque pathos.\n\nThey munched the fruit as they proceeded up the mountain, and found it\nsatisfying. Parrish seemed more himself again, though he still\nmuttered at intervals. Lucille clung closely to Jim as they proceeded.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey were treading on lava now, vitreous, and smooth as glass. It was\nimpossible to proceed further in that direction. They turned their\nsteps around the base in the direction of the sea.\n\nAfter another hour, during which their way was lit by almost\ncontinuous lurid flashes from the crater, a patch of illumination,\napparently out at sea, began to become visible. A half hour more, and\nthey were rounding the volcano's base, and suddenly it burst upon\nthem, a stupendous spectacle that drew an exclamation of amazement\nfrom Jim's lips.\n\nThat low, flat background was the sea, the sound of whose breakers was\nfaintly audible. Between sea and land ran a narrow, slender causeway,\nperhaps a mile in length. And beyond that, set on a small island, was\nthe most splendid city that Jim could have imagined.\n\nLike New York--very like New York, with its mighty towers, but more\nsymmetrical, sloping upward from the sea toward a towering rampart at\nthe heart of it, crowned with huge domes and minarets and serpentine\nramps and mighty blocks of stone that must have sheltered as many\noccupants as New York's highest skyscrapers.\n\nThe whole was snow-white, and gleamed softly in an artificial light\ndispensed from an enormous artificial planet that seemed to hover\nabove the ramparts.\n\n\"God!\" whispered Jim in awe as he gazed at the great city.\n\n\"You cannot cross that causeway,\" whimpered old Parrish. \"It's death\nto try. One sweep of the Ray will blot out every living thing.\"\n\n\"Hush! Listen!\" came from Lucille's lips. \"Something's moving down\nthere!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe distant murmur of voices, the indescribable \"feel\" of the\nproximity of other human beings told Jim that they were in imminent\ndanger. He glanced about him. A little overhead was an outcrop of\nenormous boulders, standing up like a little fortress above the smooth\nlava.\n\n\"Get behind there!\" Jim whispered.\n\nThey turned and ran, slipping and stumbling up the smooth slope.\nReaching the boulders, they ensconced themselves hastily behind them.\nJim peered out through a crevice between two of the largest stones.\nThe sound of moving things became more audible.\n\nThen, as a flash of flame shot from the crater overhead, Jim saw a\nblack human horde creeping like an array of ants around the base of\nthe mountain not far beneath.\n\nJust like an army of warrior ants it seemed to flow onward, in perfect\norder. And in the midst of it a faint violet light began to be\nvisible.\n\nParrish seized Jim's arm, shaking with terror. \"You know what that is,\nDent?\" he whimpered.\n\n\"It's Tode's Drilgoes, moving for a night attack upon Atlantis,\"\nanswered Jim. \"And that thing in the middle is the Atom Smasher.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt seemed hours before the last of the serried ranks of Drilgoes had\npassed. By the light of a lurid flash from the volcano Jim could see\nthe column winding toward the causeway. Then all was shrouded in\nimpenetrable darkness, save for the snow-soft city upon the island.\n\n\"What are we going to do?\" chattered old Parrish. \"I wish I was back\nin Tode's cave. He gave me food and let me help with his work\nsometimes. I'll die here. We'll never get away. We'll never get\nanywhere.\"\n\n\"We're safer here than anywhere else,\" answered Jim. \"We'll have to\nstay till morning, or--God, look at that!\"\n\nOut of the ramparts of the city the round, blue-white disc of the Eye\nhad suddenly disclosed itself. And simultaneously a violet flare shot\nup above the moving hosts of the Drilgoes in the middle of the\ncauseway.\n\nOut of the center of the Eye that blinding searchlight streamed. And\nthe pillar of violet fire rose up to counter it, clove it in two, as a\nman cuts off the tentacle of a cuttlefish, and left it groping\nhelplessly above the heads of the Drilgoes.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTo and fro wavered the blue-white beam, and like a protective wall the\nviolet column spread and extended, till the air was interlaced with\nthe play of the two colors. Streaks of white shot through streaks of\npurple and black neutral clouds twirled, swirling in ghostlike forms.\nIt was a scene inconceivably beautiful, and it was impossible to\nrealize what must be happening out there.\n\nMen must be dying, withering like stubble in the blue-white flames,\nwhenever they caught them. And yet, under that play of colors, Jim\ncould see the vast host crawling forward to the assault.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe held his breath. It was sublime and terrible, and on the result of\nthat conflict depended--what? What difference, when all this was\nforgotten history, antedating the written records of the human race?\n\nThen of a sudden the blue-white rays were seen to win. They were\nbeating down the violet light. Like living fingers they pierced that\nprotective wall, flinging it back, until only the tall central pillar\nremained. And then for the first time the sound of combat became\naudible.\n\nA groan of despair, of defeat, of hopelessness. The black stream was\nrecoiling, turning upon itself. In the vivid glare of the white light\nit could be seen dissolving, breaking into a thousand pieces,\nstreaming back toward the land. And, as it broke, the blue-white light\npursued, eating its way and blasting all it met. Atlantis had\ntriumphed.\n\nAnother sound was audible. From the city it came, a whirring as of\ninnumerable grasshoppers, increasing till it sounded once more like\nthe tapping of innumerable woodpeckers. Suddenly the night broke into\nwhirling balls of fire.\n\nLucille cried out. Jim leaped to his feet to see more clearly.\n\n\"It's men with wings,\" he cried. \"Scores of them. They're hurling\nsomething at the Drilgoes!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe clacking of the wing mechanism filled the air. Now the fugitives\nfrom the Drilgo host were streaming along the base of the mountain\nunderneath, seeking the safety of the jungles, and over them, riding\nthem, harrying them, flew the Atlantean birdmen, hurling their fiery\nballs. And where the balls fell, conflagrations of cold fire seemed to\nstart and run like mercury, and shrivel up everything they touched.\n\nBut the birdmen were not without casualties of their own. Here and\nthere one could be seen to drop, and then the massed Drilgoes would\nturn savagely upon him with their stone-pointed spears. The fight was\ncoming very close now. The savage cries of the Drilgoes filled the\nnight.\n\nA ball of fire broke hardly fifty yards away from where the three were\ncrouching. A birdman fluttered down like a wounded hawk and lay\na-sprawl just underneath the rampart of boulders. Jim surmounted them,\nran down the slope of the mountainside, and bent over the dying man.\nHe was hideously wounded by the thrust of a Drilgo spear--whether\nbecause the mechanism had failed, or because he had swooped too low,\nJim could not determine. As Jim bent over him he looked up at him.\n\nA youth in his teens, with the face and build of a Greek warrior, a\nworthy ancestor of European man. Jim looked at him and shuddered. \"My\ngrandfather four hundred generations removed,\" he thought.\n\nSeeing that this was no Drilgo, with eyes widened by the anticipation\nof death, the Atlantean smiled, and died.\n\nJim detached the straps that held the wings to his shoulders and\nexamined them. They were multi-hinged, built of innumerable layers of\nlaminated wood, which seemed to have been subjected to some special\ntreatment. In the base of each, just where it fitted to the curve of\nthe shoulder-blade, a tiny light was burning.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJim looped the straps about his arms and walked back to the rampart.\nOld Parrish saw him and screamed. Lucille cried out.\n\n\"I'm going to try to get the Atom Smasher,\" said Jim, pointing to the\nthin spire of violet flame that was still visible in the center of the\ncauseway. \"It's our only chance. You must stay here. If I live, I'll\nreturn. If I don't return--\"\n\nBut he knew that he must return. Nothing could kill him, because\nLucille would be waiting for him behind that rampart of stones upon\nthe bare, vitreous mountainside.\n\n\"I'm going to get the Atom Smasher,\" Jim repeated. \"In these wings\nI'll be taken for Atlantean. I'll--bring it back.\" He spoke with\nfaltering conviction. And yet there was nothing else to do. Everything\ndepended upon his being able to bring back the Atom Smasher and take\nLucille and her father away.\n\n\"I think you're right, Jim,\" answered Lucille. \"We'll--wait here till\nyou--come--back.\"\n\nHer voice died away in a sob. Jim bent and kissed her. Then he began\nexamining the mechanism of the wings. It did not appear difficult. A\nleather strap fastened around the body. Through this strap ran cords\noperated by levers upon the breast, and there was a knob in a groove\nthat looked as if it controlled the starting of the mechanism.\n\n\"I'll be back,\" said Jim.\n\nAnd suddenly the Eye appeared again, and with it there sounded once\nmore the whir of wings.\n\n\"Down!\" shouted Jim.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was too late. A score of birdmen shot out of the dark and hovered\nover them. Next moment they had descended to the ground. Lucille and\nParrish were seized, and Jim, struggling furiously, quickly found\nhimself equally helpless in their grasp.\n\nThe accents of the Atlanteans as they spoke to one another were soft\nand liquid, their faces were refined and gentle, but their strength\nwas that of athletes. Jim saw Lucille and Parrish lifted into the air;\nnext moment he himself was raised in the arms of one of the birdmen,\nwho shot upward like an arrow and headed a course back toward the\ncity, carrying Jim as if he had been as light as a child.\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n_Human Sacrifice_\n\nIn a great open space, flanked by temples and colonnades, the flight\nhad come to rest. There, under the soft artificial light that made the\nwhole city as bright as day, Jim, Lucille, and her father were set\ndown before a sort of rostrum, on which were gathered the dignitaries\nof the city.\n\nJim's hopes were rising fast, for between the Atlanteans and the\nsavage Drilgoes there was as much difference as between a modern\nAmerican and a blackfellow from the Australian bush. These men were\ncivilized to a degree that even modern America has not attained.\n\nNowhere was there a speck of dirt to be seen. Vehicles moved\nsoundlessly along the wide streets on either side of this central\nmeeting-place, and the whole city was roofed with glass, through which\ncould be seen the brilliant moon and stars--invisible from the\nmist-filled valley without.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSoft garments of white wool clothed men and women alike, fashioned\nsomething like togas, but cut short at the knee, leaving the lower\npart of the leg bare and disclosing the sandaled feet. The hair was\nlong and flowed about the shoulders. But what struck Jim most forcibly\nwas the look of utter gentleness and benignity upon these faces.\n\n\"I guess we've fallen into pretty good hands after all,\" he whispered\nto Parrish.\n\nBut one of the dignitaries upon the platform, an elderly man with a\nface reminiscent of William Jennings Bryan in his inspired moments,\nwas leaning forward out of his curved chair and addressing the old\nman, and, to Jim's astonishment, Parrish was answering.\n\nBut these were not the liquid accents of the Atlanteans. The words\nresembled the barking of a dog, and across Jim's brain there suddenly\nflashed the explanation. The dignitary was speaking in the tongue of\nthe Drilgoes, which Parrish, of course, would have learned in his five\nyears of captivity.\n\nSuddenly Parrish turned to Jim. \"He wants to know where we come from,\"\nhe said. \"I've told him from a far country. He thinks we're\nambassadors from some of the parts of Europe that the Atlanteans who\nsailed away some years ago landed at. It's no use trying to\nexplain--they don't seem to have succeeded in inventing an Atom\nSmasher for themselves.\"\n\nJim nodded, and the colloquy went on and on, while the Atlanteans\nlistened with languid interest, their kind and smiling faces seeming\nto exude benignity. At length the session seemed to have ended.\n\nParrish wore a wide grin. \"Everything's coming right, dear,\" he told\nLucille. \"The old chap says we are to be the guests of the city either\nfor a night or for a week. It's something to do with the moon, and\nthere seems to be a full moon to-night. Some quaint superstition or\nother. And then I guess we'll have a chance to get away in the Atom\nSmasher. I've learned something of the mechanism, and it won't be hard\nto operate it. We've fallen into good hands.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA squad of four soldiers or policemen, with shorter robes and what\nlooked like truncheons in their hands, made signs to the three to\naccompany them. Amid mutual bows, the city's guests filled into a\nsmall court-way, closed at the further end, on which a number of\nAtlanteans were standing.\n\nWhile Jim was wondering what the next move was to be, to his\nastonishment the whole courtyard began to rise slowly up the walls of\nthe tall buildings on either side.\n\n\"An elevator!\" gasped Lucille. \"Now I do feel that everything is\ncoming out all right, Jim, dear.\"\n\nJim did not question the psychology of this. He pressed her hand\ntenderly. Already Tode and the past were becoming a bad dream.\n\n\"Did you say anything about the Atom Smasher, Parrish?\" he asked.\n\n\"No, I thought it better not to,\" replied the old scientist. \"You see,\nthey know it only as a force that neutralizes the blue-white ray. Best\nnot to let them know we're sailing for home in it.\"\n\n\"I think that was wise,\" answered Jim, and just then the rising\ncourt-way came to a stop level with the top story of the great\nbuilding at one side.\n\nSmiling courteously, the guards invited the three to precede them\ninside an enormous hall, supported on pillars of gleaming stone\nresembling alabaster. In the center was a small, low table, triangular\nin shape, with three of the low, curved chairs. The guards invited the\nthree to be seated.\n\nAlmost immediately smiling servitors brought in fruits on platters of\nporcelain, dishes of cooked vegetables, somewhat like the modern ones,\nbut seasoned and flavored with delicious herbs. The staple dish was\nsomething like an oval banana, but infinitely more succulent. The\nthree fell to and made a hearty meal, which was washed down with fine\nwines.\n\n\"We've certainly fallen into good hands,\" said Jim. \"All we've got to\ndo is to lie low, and look pleasant, and it won't be long before we\nget an opportunity to get hold of the Atom Smasher.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe guards, seeing that they had finished their meal, smilingly\ninvited them to accompany them through a huge bronze door at one end\nof the hall. It swung back, disclosing complete darkness.\n\nJim felt Lucille's hand upon his arm. The girl was hesitating, and for\na moment Jim hesitated too, half afraid of a fall into emptiness. Then\nhe heard the footsteps of the guards ahead, and went on.\n\nIt was eery, moving there with the sound of feet in front of them,\nand, apart from that, utter silence. Then Lucille uttered a little\ncry.\n\n\"Jim, do you feel something pushing you?\" she asked.\n\n\"There is something--\" Jim swung around, but some invisible force\ncontinued to propel him forward. He moved sidewise, and the force\ngently corrected him. The sound of footsteps had ceased.\n\n\"What is it, Jim?\" cried the girl. \"Help me! Something's got hold of\nme!\"\n\nOld Parrish was struggling close beside them. Jim panted as he\nwrestled with the force, but his efforts were absolutely futile.\nSlowly, as if slid on wires, he was propelled forward, until a cushion\nof air seemed to block his further progress.\n\nDark as it was, and silent, Jim had the consciousness of other human\nbeings about him, of a vast, unseen multitude that was watching him.\n\nSuddenly the droning of a chant began to fill the place, as if a\npriest were intoning hymns. As that chant rose and fell, voices all\nabout took up the echoing refrain. Jim tried to reach Lucille, but he\ncould move his arm only a few inches against that resilient force\npressing in on all sides of him.\n\nThen, in an instant, a blinding, stabbing light shot through his\neyeballs. He heard Lucille scream, old Parrish yelp, and, with eyelids\nscrewed tight against the intolerable glare, fought once more\ndesperately and ineffectively to reach Lucille's side.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSlowly Jim managed to unscrew his eyes. He began to realize that he\nwas standing in what appeared to be an enormous amphitheatre. But high\nup, upon a narrow tongue of flooring that ran like a bridge from one\nend to the other, with Lucille on his right and Parrish on his left.\nNothing visible seemed to be restraining them, and yet they were as\nsecurely held as if fastened with tight chains.\n\nJim's brain reeled as he looked down. Imagine a bridge about half-way\nup an amphitheatre of a hundred stories, the ground beneath packed\nwith human beings no larger than ants, the whole of the vast interior\nlined with them, tier above tier, faces and forms increasing from\npismire size below to the dimensions of the human form upon a level,\nand, again, fading almost to pin-points at the summit of the vast\nbuilding, where the soft glow of the artificial light filtered through\nthe glass of the roof.\n\nHe clutched at the air, felt the soft pressure of the force that was\nrestraining him, looked at Lucille, and saw her half-unconscious with\nfear, leaning against it, leaning against that soft, resilient,\ncushionlike, invisible substance; looked at Parrish, whom the shock\nhad thrown into a sort of semi-catalepsy--Parrish, mouthing and\nstaring!\n\nHe looked forward to where the tongue of flooring ended. Here, upon a\nstage, flanked with huge carven figures, a group was gathered. At\nfirst he was unable to discern what was being enacted there, so\nbrilliant was the light that glared overhead.\n\nIt was the Eye, a round disc perhaps ten feet in diameter, that\nall-seeing Eye of Atlantis that guarded the great city, but how it\nworked Jim was totally unable to discover. He saw, however, that it\nwas blinking rapidly, the alternations being so swift that it was only\njust possible to be conscious of them. Perhaps the Eye was opening and\nclosing ten times a second.\n\nJim strained his eyes to see what was taking place on the stage at the\nend of the tongue on which he stood. What was it? What were they doing\nthere? And was that the captured Atom Smasher standing between what\nlooked like grinning idols? A group of captured Drilgoes near it?\n\nA shrill scream from Lucille echoed through the vast amphitheatre. Her\neye had seen what Jim's had not yet seen--something that had shocked\nher into complete unconsciousness.\n\nA marble figure, she stood leaning against the invisible force that\nkept her on her feet, and in those open, staring eyes was a look of\nineffable horror.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJim could see clearly now, for the light from the Eye was slowly\ndiminishing in brilliancy, or else his own eyes were growing more\naccustomed to it. Those carven figures, forming a semi-circle upon the\nplatform were figures of gods, squat, huge forms seeming to emerge out\nof the blocks of rock from which they had been fashioned.\n\nHideous, gruesome carvings they were, resembling some futuristic\nsculpture of to-day, for the artist who had fashioned them had given\nhardly more than a hint of the finished representation. It was rather\nas if the masses of rock that had been transported there had become\nvitalized, foreshadowing the dim yet awful beings that were some day\nto emerge from them.\n\nOnly the arms were clearly sculptured, and each of the half-dozen\nfigures squatting upon its haunches in that semi-circle had four of\nthem. Arms that protruded so as to form an interlacing network, and\nthe fingers were long claws fashioned of some metal. Over the arms the\nshapeless heads beat down with a leering look, and from each mouth\nprotruded a curved tongue.\n\nA masterpiece of horror, that group, like the great stone figures of\nthe Aztecs, or some of the hideous Indian gods. Seen under the glare\nof the Eye, they formed a background of horrible omen. In a flash it\ndawned upon Jim that these hideous figures might be gods of bloody\nsacrifice.\n\n\"That's why these people seem so gentle,\" he heard himself saying.\n\"It's the--the contrast.\"\n\nHe pulled himself together. Again he tried to move towards Lucille,\nand again that invisible force restrained him.\n\nYes, it was the captured Atom Smasher upon the platform, and those\nforms grouped in front of the dignitaries were captured Drilgoes, a\ndozen or so of them. And the concealed priest was droning a chant\nagain. Every other sound was hushed, but from each square foot of the\ngreat amphitheatre a pair of eyes was watching.\n\nA myriad of eyes turned upon the platform! What was going to happen\nnext?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSuddenly the priest's voice died away, and simultaneously the three\ndignitaries, who seemed to be officiating priests, from their solemn\ngestures, stepped backward, passing beneath the protruding arms of the\nidols. There sounded the deep whir of some mechanism somewhere, and\nthe same invisible force that had Jim and his two companions in its\ncontrol suddenly began to agitate the captive Drilgoes.\n\n_It was shuffling them!_ It was forcing them into line, pushing here\nand pulling there, in spite of the Drilgoes' terrified struggles. They\nwrithed and twisted, groaning and clicking in abject terror as they\nwrestled with that unseen power, and all in vain. Slowly the foremost\nof the Drilgoes was propelled forward, inch by inch, until he stood\nimmediately beneath the interlacing arms.\n\nAnd what happened next filled Jim with sick horror and loathing. For\nof a sudden the arms began to move, the iron claws cut through the\nair--a shriek of terror and anguish broke from the Drilgo's mouth ...\nand he was no longer a man, but a clawed and pulped mass of human\nflesh!\n\n\"Aiah! Aiah! Aiah!\" broke from the throats of the assembled multitude.\n\nThe weaving arms had stopped. From behind them an attendant was\ngathering up what had been the Drilgo in a basket. Then the mechanism\nhad begun again, and again that shrill cry of the spectators was\nringing in Jim's ears.\n\nLouder still rose the shriek of old Parrish as he understood. Jim put\nforth all his strength in a mad effort to break free. A child would\nhave had more chance in the grip of a giant. And each time the arms of\nthe gods revolved, the unseen force pushed Jim, Lucille, and Parrish\nnearer the platform.\n\nNow Jim understood. This horrible sacrifice was a part of the religion\nof the Atlanteans, and he, Lucille, and Parrish, were being reserved\nfor the final spectacle.\n\nAnd at the sight of Lucille beside him, stonily unconscious, and yet\nstanding, and moving like a mechanical doll, in little forward\njerks--at the sight of the girl, hardly six feet distant, and yet\nutterly beyond the touch of his finger-tips, Jim went mad. He would\nnot shout; he closed his lips in pride of race, pride of that\ncivilization that he had left twelve thousand years ahead of him. Not\nlike the shrieking Drilgoes on the platform, howling as each of them\nin turn was forced into that maze of revolving knives. But he fought\nas a madman fights. He hammered at the resilient air, while the sweat\nran down his face, he braced his feet upon the wooden tongue, and\nsought to stay his forward progress. And all the while that infernal\nforce moved him steadily onward.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was on the platform now. He was traveling the same route that the\nDrilgoes had taken. The unseen force was shuffling him, Lucille, and\nParrish, pushing and pulling them. And, despite Jim's efforts, it was\nLucille who was first of the three ... and Jim second ... and old\nParrish third....\n\nJim heard Parrish's hoarse whisper behind him, \"Death! Death! The\nuranium!\" He was fumbling at his breast, but the significance of the\nwords and gestures escaped him. He was staring ahead. Only three\nliving Drilgoes of the whole number of prisoners remained alive, and\nsuddenly it was borne in upon Jim that he knew the last of the three.\n\nIt was the Drilgo, Cain, who had been their companion in the Atom\nSmasher--there, not a dozen feet distant. Cain, his bestial face, with\nthe ridged eyebrows and great jaws convulsed with terror and dripping\nsweat. Cain, immediately in front of Lucille.\n\n\"God, let her not wake! Let her never know!\" Jim breathed. The agony\nwould be but momentary. And there was nothing a man could not endure\nif he must. He could even endure to see Lucille become--what the\nDrilgoes had become. It would soon be over now.\n\nThe Eye was blinking overhead. The hideous stone faces of the\nAtlantean gods looked down in leering mockery. Another of the Drilgoes\nhad gone the same route as the others. Cain was the second now,\nLucille the third victim, and he, Jim, would be the fourth.\n\nGritting his teeth, Jim saw the next Drilgo propelled forward into the\nwhirling knives. He saw the man fling up his arms, as if to shield his\nhead--and then he was a man no longer, and the horrible knives\nrevolved, and \"Aiah! Aiah! Aiah!\" cried the multitude.\n\nOnce more the mechanism whirred.... Once more the arms revolved. A\nhowl of terror broke from Cain's lips as he was propelled onward....\n\nThen suddenly the whirring stopped. The arms of the stone gods, with\ntheir hooked, razorlike claws, to which clung particles of flesh, were\narrested in mid-air. Cain, unharmed, was leaning backward, his\nfeatures set in a mask of awful fear.\n\nSimultaneously Jim knew that the force which had held him in thrall\nwas gone. He flung his arms out. He was free. He grasped Lucille, held\nher tightly against his breast, stood there drawing great, labored\nbreaths, waiting--for what?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA film was creeping over his eyes, but he was aware that the Eye had\nsuddenly gone out. And out of the dark the priest was chanting.\n\nThen came a deep-drawn sigh from the spectators, followed by a ringing\nshout. In place of the Eye the full moon appeared, sailing overhead.\nAnd, holding off that deathly weakness, Jim understood. The sacrifice\nhad ended; a new month had begun....\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n_Back to Long Island_\n\nJim, seated beside Lucille, was listening to Cain's gruntings and\nchucklings as he expounded the situation to old Parrish.\n\nIt was the day following the scene in the amphitheatre. The four had\nbeen escorted back along the tongue of flooring into a hall with walls\nof fretted stone and sumptuous colorings. The floor was strewn with\nrich rugs woven of some vegetable fibre. There were divans and low\nchairs. At brief intervals, servitors, always smiling, passed carrying\ntrays with wines and foods. And in the corridors were always glimpses\nof the guards.\n\n\"It was the rising of the full moon saved our lives, Dent,\" Parrish\nexplained. \"It appears they have this sacrifice at each of the moon's\nphases. The victims, captives or criminals, are eaten by the priests.\nWe've got a week's respite, Dent, and then--God help us.\"\n\nJim's arm tightened about Lucille, but the girl turned and smiled into\nhis face. There was no longer any fear there. And Jim swore to himself\nthat he would yet find some way of outwitting their devilish captors.\n\n\"What the devil are we supposed to be, criminals or what?\" he asked\nher father. \"Why do they smile at us all the time in that confounded\nway?\"\n\nParrish questioned the Drilgo, but apparently he was unable to explain\nhimself to him. \"Maybe they think it an honor for us, Dent,\" he\nanswered, \"or maybe it's their idea of etiquette. Anyway, we four are\nto head the list when the moon's at the three-quarters. God, if only\nwe could reach the Atom Smasher, I'm certain I could find out how it\nworks!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJim had tried more than once to reach it. Through the colonnades at\nthe end of the hall he could see the mechanism standing on the\nplatform, always being inspected by half a dozen or so of the\ndignitaries of Atlantis. But all his attempts to cross that tongue of\nflooring had been vetoed by the guards.\n\nThey had presented their hands to him, palms outward, and on the palms\nwere fine steel points, about two inches long, set into leather\ngauntlets. It had been impossible to try conclusions with them.\n\nTwo days went by. Once a group of dignitaries had entered the hall\nand, with smiles and profuse bows, inspected the prisoners. Then they\nhad departed. And Jim had paced the floor, to and fro, thinking\ndesperately.\n\nThere was no sort of weapon with which to hazard an attack. Jim knew\nthat they were under the closest observation. He could only wait and\nhope. And if all else failed, he meant to hurl himself, with Lucille\nin his arms, off the tongue of floor into the depths below when their\ntime came.\n\nOn the third morning, after a troubled sleep induced by very\nweariness, Jim was awakened by one of the guards, and started up to\nsee one of the bowing dignitaries before him, and Parrish and Lucille\nsitting up among their rugs.\n\nBowing repeatedly, the smiling old man addressed some words to Jim,\nand then turned to Parrish.\n\n\"He says he wants you to show him the way the Atom Smasher works,\"\nsaid Parrish. \"Now's our chance, Dent. He thinks it's simply an\napparatus for neutralizing the blue-white ray. Don't let him guess--\"\n\n\"I won't let him guess,\" Jim answered. \"Tell him we'll go and show\nhim--\"\n\n\"I've told him, and he says only you are to go. He's suspicious. Say\nsomething quickly, Dent.\"\n\n\"Tell him,\" said Jim, \"that I must have my two assistants and the\nlady. Tell him I may also need the help of some of his people. It\nrequires many men to operate the machine.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nParrish translated, speaking in the Drilgo tongue, which was their\nonly means of communication. The Atlantean considered. Then he spoke\nagain.\n\n\"He says that we three men may go, but Lucille must be left behind,\"\ngroaned Parrish.\n\n\"The answer is no,\" said Jim.\n\nThe old dignitary, who seemed somewhat crestfallen, departed with an\nexpressive gesture. Jim and Parrish looked at each other.\n\n\"That's our end,\" groaned Parrish.\n\n\"No, he'll bite,\" answered Jim, with the first grin that had appeared\non his countenance since their arrival. \"Let's make our plans quickly.\nWe must contrive to get Lucille inside the machine, under the pretense\nof assisting with the mechanism. And Cain, of course,\" he added,\nglancing at the goggly-eyed Drilgo. \"You do your best to locate the\nstarting mechanism, Parrish, and signal me the moment you're ready.\nWe'll both leap in, and the four of us will sail--God, I don't care\nwhere we sail to, so long as we get away from here! Into eternity, if\nneed be. But I hope it's Long Island!\"\n\nBack came the dignitary with two of the guards. Smiling at Jim, he\nindicated by signs that the three others might accompany him. The\nAtlanteans had bitten, as Jim had forecast.\n\nThe four proceeded along the hall and over the tongue of flooring.\nThis time the force that had previously controlled their movements was\nnot in action. At the farther end of the bridge they saw the group of\ndignitaries gathered about the Atom Smasher, examining it curiously.\nOver their heads the hooked arms of the hideous gods were raised. The\nEye was darkened, as if with a curtain, and through the glass roof,\nhigh overhead, the sunlight streamed down upon the empty amphitheatre.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn spite of their smiles, the dignitaries of Atlantis were very much\non the alert, as their tense attitudes denoted. Two more guards had\nappeared, and Jim saw that they were uncovering some apparatus at the\nbase of the Eye. They were swinging a camera-like object toward him,\nits lens focused upon the Atom Smasher. It was not difficult to\nunderstand what was in the minds of the Atlanteans. The dignitaries\nwere uneasy and mistrustful, and at the first suspicion of treachery\nthey meant to loose the blue-white Ray contained in the apparatus, and\nblow the Atom Smasher and the group about it to destruction.\n\nJim intercepted a sign from Parrish, indicating that he was to make\npretense of assisting him. He bent over the machine, Lucille beside\nhim. Parrish was busily examining the wheels and levers. He was\nadjusting the thumbscrews, moving the needles along the dials.\n\nOne of the Atlanteans spoke, and Cain translated into \"Drilgo\" for\nParrish's benefit. Parrish answered. Then, without raising his head,\nthe old man said quietly, \"I've located the starting lever, Dent. You\nand Lucille get inside quickly and pretend you're doing something to\nthe machinery.\"\n\nThey stepped over the bow of the boat and stood beside Parrish, who\ncontinued examining the wheels. \"We mustn't forget Cain,\" whispered\nthe girl to her father. \"Oh, I hope he understands!\"\n\nBut there was no direct evidence that Cain did understand, and Parrish\ndared not warn him in \"Drilgo,\" for fear one of the Atlanteans might\nunderstand the language. Cain was standing close beside the boat. But\nhe was not in the boat.\n\nAgain one of the Atlanteans shot a question at Parrish. Parrish\nbeckoned to Cain, and awaited the translation. He answered.\n\nEach moment was growing tenser. It was impossible that the Atlanteans\ncould fail to understand what was being planned. The only saving\nchance was that they did not realize the possibilities of escape that\nthe vessel offered. A full minute went by.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSuddenly Parrish raised his head. \"I've got it fixed, I think, Dent,\"\nhe said. \"I'm going to count. When I reach 'three,' seize Cain and\npull him aboard.\"\n\nJim nodded. The uneasiness was increasing. The guards at the\ncamera-like object were each holding some sort of mechanical accessory\nin their hands. It looked like a small sphere of glass, and it\nconnected with the apparatus by means of a hollow tube of fibre. Jim\nguessed that in an instant the Ray could be made to dart out of the\nlens. It would be quick work--as nearly as possible instantaneous\nwork.\n\n\"Ready, Dent?\" asked Parrish in an even voice. In this crisis the old\nman had become astonishingly calm. He seemed the calmest of the lot.\n\"One!\"\n\nJim beckoned to Cain, who came toward him, his eyes goggling in\ninquiry.\n\n\"Two!\"\n\nJim reached out and took Cain by the arm. There was a sharp question\nfrom the Atlantean who had spoken before.\n\n\"Three!\"\n\nWith all his force Jim yanked Cain over the edge of the boat. The\nDrilgo stumbled and fell headlong with a howl of terror. But\nheadlong--inside.\n\nWhat happened was practically instantaneous. A sudden whir of the\nmechanism, a violet glow from the funnel, the smell of chlorine--a\nflash of blinding blue-white light. The Atlantean guards had fired--a\nquarter-second too late!\n\nThe thump, thump of the electrical discharge died away. The four were\nin the boat, whirling away through space. Cain was rising to his\nknees, a woe-begone expression on his face. And there was a clean cut,\nwith charred, black edges along one side of the boat, showing how near\nthe Atlanteans had come to success.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe relief, after the hideous suspense of the past days, was almost\ntoo much for the three white people. \"We're free, we're going back\nhome!\" cried Jim exultantly, as he caught Lucille in his arms. And she\nsurrendered her lips to his, while the tears streamed down her checks.\nOld Parrish, at the instrument board, looked up, smiling and\nchuckling. Even Cain, understanding that they were not to be hacked to\nbits with knives, gurgled and grinned all over his black face.\n\n\"How long will it take us to get back?\" Jim asked Parrish after a\nwhile.\n\n\"I--I'm not quite sure, my boy,\" the old man replied. \"You see--I\nhaven't quite familiarized myself with the machine as yet.\"\n\n\"But we'll get back all right?\" asked Jim.\n\n\"Well, we--we're headed in the right direction,\" answered Parrish.\n\"You see, my boy, it's rather an intricate table of logarithmic\ncalculations that that scoundrel has pasted on this board. The great\ndanger appears to be that of coming within the orbit of the giant\nplanet Jupiter. Of course, I'm trying to keep within the orbit of the\nEarth, but there is a danger of being deflected onto Pallas, Ceres, or\none of the smaller asteroids, and finding ourselves upon a rock in\nspace.\"\n\nJim and Lucille looked at Parrish in consternation. \"But you don't\nhave to leave the Earth, do you?\" Jim asked.\n\n\"Unfortunately, it's pretty hard sticking to the Earth, my lad,\" said\nParrish. \"You see, Earth has moved a good many million miles through\nspace since the time of Atlantis.\"\n\nBut both Jim and Lucille noticed that Parrish was already speaking of\nAtlantis as if it was in the past. They drew a hopeful augury from\nthat. And then there was nothing to do but resign themselves to that\nuniversal greyness--and to hope.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey noticed that Cain seemed to be watching Parrish's movements with\nunusual interest. The Neanderthal man seemed fascinated by the play of\nthe dials, the whir of the wheels and gyroscopes.\n\n\"Are you setting a course, dad?\" asked Lucille presently. \"I mean, do\nyou know just where we are?\"\n\n\"To tell you the truth, my dear,\" answered her father, \"I don't. I'm\nrelying on some markings that Tode made on the chart--certain\ncombinations of figures. God only knows where they'll take us to. But\nI'm hoping that by following them we shall find ourselves back on Long\nIsland in the year 1930.\n\n\"No, that rascal could hardly have written down those figures to no\npurpose. They seem to me to comprise a course, both going and\nreturning. But the calculations are very intricate, especially in the\n_time_ dimension. I've nearly reached the last row now. Then, we shall\nhave arrived, or--we sha'n't.\"\n\nJim and Lucille sat down again. There was nothing that they could do.\nBut somehow their hopes of reaching Long Island in the year of grace\n1930 had grown exceedingly slim. Everything depended upon whether or\nnot Tode had meant those figures to represent the course back to the\nstarting point or not.\n\nA desperate hope--that was all that remained to them. They watched\nParrish as his eyes wandered along the rows of figures, while his\nfingers moved the micrometer screws. And then he looked up.\n\n\"We're reaching the end of our course,\" he said. \"We're going to land\nsomewhere. God knows where it will be. We must hope--that's all that's\nleft us.\"\n\nHis hands dropped from the dials. He pressed a lever. The blur of\nnights and days began to slow. A column of vivid violet light shot\nfrom the funnel.\n\n\"Grip tight!\" shouted Parrish.\n\nThump, thump! The Atom Smasher was vibrating violently. A jar threw\nJim against Lucille. It was coming to a standstill. Trees appeared.\nJim uttered a shout. He stepped across to Parrish and wrung his hand.\nHe put his arms about Lucille and kissed her.\n\nThey were back at the Vanishing Place, and all their sufferings seemed\nto be of the past....\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n_A Fruitless Journey_\n\n\"Why don't you stop the boat, Parrish?\"\n\n\"I'm trying to, lad!\"\n\nThe Atom Smasher was still vibrating, even more violently than before.\nA column of violet light was pouring from her funnel. The pool, the\nmud, the walls of heaped up water were discernible, but all quivering\nand reproduced, line after line, to infinity. It was like looking into\nthe rear-view mirror of a car that is vibrating rapidly. It was like\none of those Cubist paintings of a woman descending the stairs, where\none had to puzzle out which is the woman and which is the stairs.\n\nA dreadful thought shot through Jim's mind. He remembered what he had\nsaid to Tode: \"You can't hold the boat still in four-dimensional\nspace.\"\n\nThis was not quite the same. By stopping the infernal mechanism, one\nre-entered three-dimensional space, and landed. Certainly the Atom\nSmasher could land. They were not like the motorcyclist who got on a\nmachine for the first time, and rode to the admiration of all who saw\nhim, except that he couldn't find out how to stop.\n\nYet there was Parrish still fumbling with the controls, and the boat\nwas still vibrating at a terrific rate of speed. It is impossible to\ndream of leaping out, for there was no solidity, no continuity in the\nscenery outside.\n\nIt was not like attempting to leap from a moving train, for instance.\nIn that case one knows that there is solid earth beneath, however hard\none lands. Here everything was distorted, a sort of mirror reflection.\nAnd Jim noticed a strange thing that had never occurred to him before.\nEverything was reversed, as in a mirror picture. That clump of trees,\nfor instance, which should have been on the right, was on the left.\n\nParrish looked up. \"There's some means of stopping her, of course,\" he\nsaid. \"There must be a lever--but I don't know where to look for it in\nall this mess.\" He pointed to the revolving wheels. No, it might be a\nmatter of days of experimenting in order to discover the elusive\nswitch.\n\n\"It may be a combination of switches,\" said Parrish. \"I don't know\nwhat we're going to do.\"\n\n\"Suppose I jumped and chanced it,\" Jim suggested.\n\nLucille caught his arm with a little cry. Parrish shook his head.\n\n\"That devil--Listen: there was a Drilgo he disliked. He threw him out\nof the boat just before she landed at the cave. Everything was in\nplain sight, plainer than things are here. But he was never seen\nagain. For God's sake, lad, sit still. I'll try--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHours later Parrish was still trying. And gradually Jim and Lucille\nhad ceased to hope.\n\nSide by side they had sat, watching that glimmering scene about them.\nSometimes everything receded into a blur, across which sunlight and\nshadow, and then moonlight raced, at others the surroundings were so\nclear that it almost seemed as if, by steadying the boat, they could\nleap ashore. And once there happened something that sent a thrill of\ncold fear through both of them.\n\nFor where the pool had been there appeared suddenly a hut--and Tode,\nstanding in the doorway, looking about him, a malicious sneer curving\nhis lips.\n\nJim leaped to his feet, and old Parrish, who had seen Tode too, sprang\nup in wild excitement.\n\n\"Sit down, lad,\" he shouted. \"It's nothing. I--I turned the micrometer\nscrew a trifle hard. I got us back to five years ago, when we were\nliving here with Tode. That's just a picture--out of the past, Jim!\"\n\nJim understood, but he sank down again with cold sweat bathing his\nforehead. The terrific powers of the Atom Smasher were unveiling\nthemselves more and more each moment. Jim felt Lucille's hand on his\narm. He looked into her face.\n\n\"Jim, darling, what's going to happen to us if dad can't find how to\nwork the machine?\"\n\n\"I don't know, dear. I've thought that we might all jump out and\nchance it. If we held each other tight, we'd probably land in the same\nplace--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOld Parrish stood up. \"I can't work it, Jim,\" he said. \"Tode's got us\nbeat. There's only one thing for us to do. You can guess what it is.\"\n\n\"I think I can,\" said Jim, glancing askance at Lucille. Yes, he knew,\nbut he lacked the heart to tell her. \"If we were all to jump out,\ntied together--don't you think we might land--somewhere near where we\nwant to land?\" he asked.\n\n\"Jim, do you realize what each vibration of this boat means?\" asked\nParrish. \"There's a table on the instrument-board. It's a wave length\nof four thousand miles in space and nineteen years in time.\"\n\n\"You mean we're moving to London or San Francisco and back--\"\n\n\"Further than that, every infinite fraction of a second,\" answered\nParrish. \"No, Jim, we--we wouldn't land. So we must just go back to\nwhere we came from, and--\"\n\nHe had been speaking in a low voice, calculated not to reach Lucille's\nears. The girl had been leaning back, her eyes closed, as if half\nasleep. Now she rose and stepped up to her father and lover. \"You can\ntell me the truth,\" she said. \"I'm not afraid.\"\n\n\"We've got to go back, Lucille,\" answered her father. \"It's our only\nchance. By following the course in reverse we can expect to make\nAtlantis again--\"\n\n\"Back to that horrible place?\"\n\n\"No, my dear. The chart will lead us, obviously, back to the cave\nwhere Tode has his headquarters. We must try to surprise him, and\nforce him to bring us back to Long Island.\"\n\n\"And then?\" asked Lucille.\n\nParrish shrugged his shoulders. \"We'll face that problem when we come\nto it,\" he answered.\n\n\"But how do you expect to be able to land at the other end any more\nthan this?\" asked Jim. \"Suppose the machine continues to vibrate\ninstead of coming to a standstill?\"\n\n\"I think,\" said Parrish, \"that we'll be able to strike a bargain with\nTode. Obviously he will be willing to bring the machine to a\nstandstill in order to parley with us. We'll make terms--the best we\ncan. After all, he can't afford to remain marooned on the isle of\nAtlantis without the Atom Smasher.\"\n\n\"I hate the idea of bargaining with that wretch,\" said Lucille.\n\n\"So do we all, dear,\" answered Jim. \"But there's nothing else that we\ncan do. It's just a matter of give and take. And I'd be glad to\nconsent to any terms that would bring us three safe back to earth,\nwith all this business behind us.\"\n\n\"I'll start back, then,\" said Parrish, turning back to the instrument\nboard.\n\nAnd, to the familiar thump, thump of the electrical discharge, the\nAtom Smasher took up its backward journey once more.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA long time passed. With her head resting against Jim's breast,\nLucille rested. Jim bent over her, trying to discover whether she was\nasleep or not. Her eyes were closed, her breathing so soft that she\nhardly seemed alive. An infinite pity for the girl filled Jim's heart,\nand, mingled with it, the intense determination to overcome the madman\nwho had subjected her to these perils. He glanced across at Parrish,\nfingering his screws. Old Parrish looked up and nodded. There was a\nnew determination in the old man's face that made him a different\nperson from the crazed old man whom Jim had encountered at the\nVanishing Place.\n\n\"We can beat him, Parrish!\" Jim called, and Parrish looked back and\nnodded again. \"We're nearly back to the top of the column,\" he\nanswered.\n\nNot long afterward Parrish looked up once more. \"Stand by, Jim!\" he\ncalled. \"And be ready. Tode will be aware of our approach by means of\nthe sensitive instruments he keeps in his laboratory. But don't harm\nhim. We want him aboard, and we want him badly. He won't be able to\nplay any more tricks with us. I've learned too much about the Atom\nSmasher.\"\n\nHe pressed a lever, and the greyness dissolved into its component\nparts of light and darkness. A jar. Thump, thump! The violet light!\nLucille looked up, raised herself, uttered a low cry and caught at\nJim's arm, trembling.\n\nThey had run their course truly. The Atom Smasher was vibrating\noutside the entrance to Tode's cave. And that was Tode, standing\nthere, watching them, that devilish grin of his accentuated to the\nutmost. A blurred figure that appeared and vanished, and a surrounding\ncrowd of Drilgoes--how many it was impossible to guess, for they\nlooked like a crowd of apes in motion.\n\nSuddenly Tode disappeared, and a moment later Lucille uttered a\nterrified cry as his voice spoke in her ear:\n\n\"I thought you'd be back. I knew you'd got away from Atlantis when my\nrecorder showed the waves of electrical energy proceeding from the\ncity. You were clever, Dent, but you see, you had to come back to me\nto get my help.\"\n\n\"Don't be afraid, dear,\" said Jim, trying to soothe the girl. \"That's\na wireless receiving apparatus.\" He pointed to a sort of cabinet\nenclosed among the rotating wheels, and then it was evident that\nTode's voice was proceeding from it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTode's figure appeared again, dancing through a haze of lines and\npatches. He was holding something in his hand which Jim made out to be\nthe mouthpiece of a microphone. The voice inside the Atom Smasher\nspoke again:\n\n\"Turn all the micrometer screws until the needles register zero,\nParrish. Then turn Dial D to point 3, Dial C to 5, Dial B to 1, and\nDial A to 2. I'll repeat.... Now press the starting lever, Parrish,\nand you'll find yourself on firm ground again.\"\n\nA few moments later the Atom Smasher was pouring out an immense column\nof the violet light, and slowly the vibration ceased. The blurred\nforms of Tode, of the Drilgoes grew clear. They had arrived.\n\nTode stepped over the rail. \"And now, my friends, we'll have a talk,\"\nhe said.\n\n\"No tricks, Tode,\" Jim warned him, \"You've probably got a number of\ndeviltries up your sleeve--\"\n\n\"One or two, Dent,\" grinned Tode.\n\n\"We're willing to negotiate.\"\n\n\"Of course you are. You see, I hold the trumps, Dent. Those dial\ndeflections, which are inevitable in the construction of any piece of\nmechanism, are not the same for Earth in 1920. Don't think you can use\nthe same figures to land with. You must remember that there has been a\nprecession of the equinoxes since the time of Atlantis, with a\nconsequent shift in the earth's axis. No, Dent, I've got you very much\nwhere I want you. But I'm willing to discuss terms with you. First of\nall, let's get rid of this useless cargo. I don't believe in\noverburdening a ship,\" he grinned.\n\nHe picked up Cain bodily and heaved the astonished Drilgo over the\nside before he knew what was happening to him. Cain picked himself up\nand rubbed his sides, whimpering mournfully. The Drilgoes crowded\ncloser, their faces agape with astonishment. Tode spoke a command\nsharply, and they scattered.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Before we come to terms, Dent, I'll give you a piece of news that may\ninterest you,\" said Tode. \"Much has happened during the time you've\nbeen away. Ambassadors have been out to see me from Atlantis. With the\naid of a Drilgo interpreter, they conveyed to me that they had been\ngreatly impressed by the disappearance of the Atom Smasher. They have\nnothing like it, of course, and they think I'm a Number One magician.\n\n\"The upshot is, they want me to accept the supreme rule of the city,\nand use my arts to restore the lost territory that has sunk beneath\nthe waves. They swore on an image of their god, Cruk, that they were\nsincere. I told them that I'd sent the Atom Smasher away on a journey,\nbut that it would be back shortly, and that I'd then give them their\nanswer.\n\n\"Now, Dent\"--Tode's face took on that look of fanaticism that Jim had\nseen on it before--\"I'm going to repeat the proposition I made to you\nbefore. Join me. I'll make you my chief subordinate, and I'll load you\nand Parrish down with honors. Everything that a human being can desire\nshall be yours. And in a year or two, when we're tired of being gods,\nwe'll take the Atom Smasher back to Earth and destroy it, and with our\nwealth we'll become the supreme rulers of Earth too. I need you, Dent.\nYou don't realize how lonely life can be when one is worshiped as a\ngod. As for Lucille, there are a thousand maidens more beautiful than\nshe is, in Atlantis. Come, Dent, your answer! Your last chance, Dent!\nDon't throw it away!\"\n\nHe read the answer before Jim could speak it. Jim saw Tode's face\nflicker, and hurled himself upon him. Lucille screamed. The two men\nwrestled together in the narrow confines of the circular boat. Jim\nstruck Tode a blow that sent him reeling against the rail. Then he\nfelt himself seized from behind. A giant Drilgo had him in his arms.\nHe lifted him over the side and flung him to the earth. In an instant\nthe chattering Drilgoes were crowding down upon him.\n\nStruggling madly, Jim saw Tode fell old Parrish with a blow, push back\nLucille as she sprang at him, and quickly press the starting lever.\nThe column of violet fire faded, there came the whir of the\nmechanism--the Atom Smasher vanished....\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n_The Blinded Eye_\n\nJim fought with all his strength; he managed to shake off his\nassailants and regain his feet. Then one of the Drilgoes poised his\nstone-tipped spear, ready to hurl it through his body.\n\nBut the spear never left the Drilgo's hand in Jim's direction. Like a\ngreat black ape, Cain leaped upon the fellow and bore him to the\nground, his feet twined around his shoulders, his hands gripping his\nthroat. Not until the Drilgo had been reduced to a heaving,\nhalf-strangled hulk did Cain leave him.\n\nThen Cain, bending until his stomach almost touched the ground, came\nworming toward Jim, making signs of obeisance.\n\nWhat had happened that Jim had won the Drilgo's faith? Why did Cain\nnow look upon him, apparently, as his master? It was impossible to\ngauge the processes of the black man's mind, and at the moment Jim was\nin no mood to wonder. The stunning disaster that had overtaken him\nmonopolized his thoughts.\n\nLucille and Parrish were once more in Tode's power. That was the\ndominating fact. The only gleam of comfort in the situation was that\nTode had given him the clue to his movements.\n\nBeyond a doubt Tode had taken his captives into Atlantis with him. It\nwas impossible to disbelieve Tode's statement that he had been offered\nthe supreme power in the city. Tode's egotism would have compelled him\nto blurt out that fact. Besides, Tode had certainly not gone back to\nearth.\n\nJim must force his way into Atlantis. He would find and rescue the two\nprisoners or die there.\n\nHe turned away from the groveling Cain and the chattering Drilgoes,\nwho, inspired by Cain's example, now seemed animated by the same\ninstinct to obey him, and went into the cave. But at the entrance he\nturned for a moment and looked back.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was night. The valley was swathed in mists, the volcano opposite\nwas spouting a shaft of lurid fire. On the water was a path of\nmoonlight, where the clouds had been dispersed by the Atlanteans. Jim\ntook in the scene, he raised one arm and shook his fist. Then, without\na word, he passed inside.\n\nThere was a soft light in the cave, streaming out from an inner\nchamber, access to which was through a narrow orifice in the rock.\nJim passed through, and found himself in Tode's laboratory.\n\nHe was astonished at its completeness, still more so at the existence\nof numerous pieces of apparatus whose purpose it was difficult to\nunderstand. There was a radio transmitter and receiver, but improved\nout of all recognition from those in use in the prosaic year 1930.\nThree or four tiny dynamos, little more than toys in appearance, were\ngenerating as much voltage, from the indicators, as a modern power\nstation. And overhead was a dial, with two series of figures in black\nand red, and two needles, both of which were swinging briskly,\nindicating that there was an intense electrical disturbance in the\nvicinity.\n\nThe Atom Smasher! Jim took heart. Tode could not be far away! He\nlooked about him, subconsciously trying to discover some implement\nthat would prove of service to him, but there was nothing that he\ncould see, not even one of the ray tubes. He looked about uneasily.\n\nThen his eyes fell upon something so singularly out of place that it\nlooked, for the moment, like some pre-historic weapon. It was the last\nthing Jim would have expected to find there--nothing more nor less\nthan a sporting rifle!\n\nDeer shooting had been one of Tode's pastimes in the old days, and\nmore than one fat buck had been surreptitiously shot for the benefit\nof the larder at the Vanishing Place. There was something almost\npathetic in the sight of that rifle and the fifty cartridges in their\ncardboard carton. Perhaps Tode had pictured himself shooting big game\nin Atlantis at some period or other. It was a human weakness that for\nan instant lessened Jim's hate and horror of the man. It brought him\nto a saner view of the situation. Jim had been on the point of losing\nhis powers of reason. The sight of the rifle restored them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe turned sharply as he heard a sound in the entrance. Cain was coming\ntoward him, with many genuflexions, and much stomach wriggling. He\nstopped, straightened himself. There was a look of singular\nintelligence on the Drilgo's face.\n\nHe began chattering, pointing in the direction of Atlantis. Jim could\nmake nothing of what he was trying to convey.\n\n\"Yes, they're there,\" he said bitterly, \"but I don't see how that's\ngoing to help me.\"\n\n\"Oh my poor Lucille!\" said Cain unexpectedly.\n\nThe words were like a parrot's speech, the intonation so remarkable a\ncopy of old Parrish's that Jim was flabbergasted. Nevertheless it was\nevident that Cain knew he was referring to Lucille.\n\nWith a strange, slinking motion he crossed the laboratory and bent\nbeneath a huge slab of stone, resting on two great hewn rocks. He\nemerged, holding in his arms two curious contrivances. He laid them at\nJim's feet.\n\nJim stared at them, and suddenly understood what they were. They were\ntwo pairs of wings, of the kind the Atlanteans had used when they made\ntheir aerial sortie against the Drilgoes.\n\nCain picked up one pair and began adjusting it about his body. He made\nfluttering movements with his arms.\n\n\"You mean that you've learned how to fly, you black imp of Satan?\"\nshouted Jim.\n\nAnd Cain, as if understanding, nodded and beamed all over his black\nface.\n\nWith that Jim's idea was born. If the Drilgoes would follow him, he\nwould lead them against Atlantis. And, before the assault began, he\nwould fly to the great Eye that guarded it, and blind it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe thought afterward that it was like a supernatural revelation, this\nscheme, that leaped full-fledged into his brain. And Cain had\ndeveloped extraordinary executive ability. Outside the cave, through\nrifts in the swirls of fog, Jim could see innumerable Drilgoes massing\nin the valley, as if they understood Jim's purpose. From Cain's\ngesticulations, and the number of times he rubbed his stomach, it was\nevident that he counted upon sacking Atlantis and was imagining\ninnumerable meals of fat captives.\n\nEach flash of lurid light from the volcano disclosed further masses of\nDrilgoes, armed with their stone spears, apparently assembling for the\nattack. Whether Tode had summoned them before the Atlanteans offered\nhim the rulership of the city, or whether Jim's own plan had been\ncommunicated to them by some telepathic process, it was impossible to\nguess, but there was not the least doubt but that they were prepared\nto follow him.\n\nCain nudged Jim and began strapping the other pair of wings about his\nbody. Jim saw that the energy was supplied by two tiny, lights burning\nin the base, cold fire, stored energy whose strength he did not guess.\nFor, when Cain took him by the hand, and motioned to him to slide the\nknob in the groove, he was hurled skyward like a rocket.\n\nThere followed a delirious hour. Tossing and tumbling like a pigeon in\na gale, Jim by degrees acquired mastery over the apparatus. At the end\nof the hour he could fly almost as well as Cain, who, like a black\nguardian angel kept beside him, reaching out a hand when he\noverbalanced, and pulling him out of aerial side-slips.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSuddenly Cain motioned toward the volcano, and started toward it in a\nrocketlike swoop. Jim understood. The Drilgoes were ready for the\nattack upon Atlantis.\n\nJim dropped to earth, ran back into the cave, and picked up the rifle\nand the carton of ammunition. He filled the magazine, and, with the\nrifle on his arm, rose into the air again. Cain was circling back,\nuttering weird cries of distress at finding his master absent.\n\n\"It's all right, Cain,\" said Jim. \"I'm here.\"\n\nSide by side they flew steadily toward the base of the great cone,\nwhich was pouring out a fan-shaped stream of fire. Rumblings shook the\nearth; it was evident that another upheaval was in course of\npreparation. The long column of the Drilgoes could be seen, extending\naround the flank of the mountain.\n\nThen of a sudden the Eye opened. And across the causeway came the\nblue-white Ray, carrying death and destruction.\n\nThe Drilgoes, who had learned wisdom, remained concealed out of the\nRay's path, and escaped, but a great dinosaur, fifty or sixty feet in\nlength, startled by the light, came blundering out of the ferns,\nuttered a bellow, and melted into an amorphous mass. Birds dropped\nfrom their roosting places with a sound like that of falling hail.\nBlack paths were cloven through the midst of the jungle.\n\nRifle in hand, Jim soared into the air, and shot forward, high above\nthe causeway toward the glowing Eye.\n\nHe had noticed that the blue-white ray appeared in cycles of about two\nminutes, and had made his plans accordingly. Two minutes in which to\naccomplish his task, or take the chance of a hideous death. Some\nthirty seconds carried him right into the glowing heart of the winking\nEye: he hovered and raised his rifle.\n\nUnderneath him the breakers thundered: round the Eye a myriad\nsea-birds fluttered, dashing themselves against it, falling into the\nwaves. Huge and high the great city towered into the skies, lit by its\nsoft incandescence. Jim could see the throngs in the streets, the\ntraffic. But what was happening in the other side of the Eye?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSuddenly he saw the moon in her third quarter sailing through the\nskies, and a hideous fear overcame him. Suppose Tode had met with\ntreachery; suppose that this very night Lucille were doomed to be\nsacrificed to the terrible god Cruk!\n\nSuppose that even at that moment her tender flesh were being\nsacrificed by the awful hooks!\n\nHe drew a bead upon the Eye and fired--and missed. The bullet went\nwide. But even if it struck, what guarantee had he that it would\nshatter the glass, or whatever substance it was that covered the orb?\n\nHe lost position, and knew that the two-minute interval was drawing to\na close. He soared and fired again. The Eye still glowed.\n\nThen of a sudden a blinding ray shot forth from it, so dazzling that\nit seemed to sear Jim's eyeballs. The interval was ended.\n\nIt shot beneath him, but no more than a few feet, and turning his eyes\nshoreward, Jim saw it sweep along the causeway and tear a black path\nthrough the forest. Frantically he soared, and circled around the\ntemple.\n\nThe ray went out. Two minutes more. And now the temporary panic had\npassed; Jim's nerves grew steady as a rock. He eased the controls and\nfloated in toward the glowing orb. Sea-mews, screaming, dashed\nthemselves against it and fell, wounded and broken, into the breaking\nseas below. They fluttered past Jim's face, one impacted against his\nchest with a thud that rocked him where he hovered.\n\nBut Jim knew that he could not fail. At a distance of fifty feet he\ndrew a bead upon the centre of the Eye and pressed the trigger.\n\nAnd instantly the light went out....\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n_The Fight in the Dark_\n\nHe dropped down softly to the causeway. Within the city he heard a\nsound such as he had never heard before, as if some ancient prophecy\nof doom had been fulfilled, a wailing \"Aiah! Aiah! Aiah!\" that was\ncaught up from throat to throat and rose upon the wind in a clamor\nwild and mournful as that of the sea-birds around the broken Eye. It\nwas the death-keening of proud Atlantis, Queen of the Atlantic for\nfifty thousand years. She was dying in darkness.\n\nFor, with the blinding of the Eye, all the soft lights within the city\nhad gone out. Dense, utter, impenetrable darkness reigned, and even\nthe gibbous moon, floating overhead, seemed to give no light.\n\nJim dropped to the causeway and began running in the direction of the\ncity. But, feeling the drag of his wings, he unbuckled the strap and\nflung them away. He might need them, but his one thought was to get to\nLucille, if she were still alive. And he felt that each moment lost\nmight mean that he would be too late.\n\nThrough the blackness he raced forward, hearing that sobbing ululation\nwithin the walls. But behind him he heard another sound, and shuddered\nat it, all his hopes suddenly reversed. For that sound was the\nshouting of the Drilgoes as they rushed forward to conquest. And now\nit seemed a monstrous thing that proud Atlantis should be at the mercy\nof these hordes. He had let loose destruction upon the world. But it\nwas to save Lucille.\n\nThat was his consolation. Yet he hardly checked the racing thoughts\nwithin his mind even for a moment, to meditate on what he had done.\nThose thoughts were all of Lucille. He must get to her before the\nDrilgoes entered. And he ran faster, panting, gasping, till of a\nsudden the portals loomed before him, and he saw a crowd of frenzied\nAtlanteans struggling to pass through, and a file of soldiers\nstruggling to keep them back.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe could distinguish nothing more than the confused struggle. He\nhurled himself into the midst of the crowd and swept it back. He was\nwithin the walls now, and struggling to pass through the mob of people\nthat was swarming like homeless bees.\n\nHe fought them with flailing fists, he clove a pathway through them,\nuntil he found himself in a great shadowy space that he recognized as\nthe central assembly of the city. More by instinct than design he hit\nupon the narrow court that was the elevator. But the court was filled\nwith another mob of struggling people, and in the darkness there was\nno possibility of discovering the secret of raising it.\n\nHe blundered about, raging, forcing a path now here, now there. He ran\ninto blind alleys, into small threading streets about the court, which\nled him back into the central place of assembly. It was like a\nnightmare, that blind search under the pale three-quarter moon and the\nblack, star-blotched sky.\n\nSuddenly Jim found himself wedged by the pressure of the crowd into a\nsort of recess leading off the elevator court. So strong was the\npressure here that he was unable to move an inch. Wedged bolt upright,\nhe could only wait and let the frenzied mob stream past him. And\nlouder above the sound of wailing came the roars of the Drilgoes\nswarming along the causeway.\n\nSuddenly something gave behind him--a door, as it seemed, broken off\nits hinges by the mob pressure. Jim was hurled backward, and fell\nheavily down a flight of stone stairs, bringing up against a stone\nbalustrade. He got up, unconscious of his bruises, ran to the top of\nthe flight, and saw the dim square of palest twilight where the door\nhad been.\n\nBut over him he could faintly see the stairs and the balustrade,\nwinding away to what seemed immeasurable height. That stairway must\nlead to the top of the building, and thence there should be some\naccess to the amphitheatre. Jim turned toward it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSuddenly a tremendous uproar filled the streets, yells, the clicking\ngrunts of the Drilgoes, the screams of the panic-stricken populace.\nThe invaders had arrived, and they were sweeping all before them. No\nchance of recognition in that darkness. Lucille! Shouting her name,\nJim began to ascend the stairs in leaps of three at a time.\n\nBut long before he reached the top he was ascending one by one, with\nstraining limbs and laboring breath. Red slaughter down below, a very\ninferno of sound; above, that shadowy stairway, still extending almost\nto the heavens. Step after step, flight beyond flight!\n\nJim's lungs were bursting, and his heart hammering as if it would\nbreak his chest. One flight more! One more! Another! Suddenly he\nrealized that his task was ended. In place of the stairs stood a vast\nhall, and beyond that another hall, dim in the faint light that\nfiltered through the glass above.\n\nJim thought he remembered where he was. Beyond that next hall there\nshould be the tongue of flooring, crossing the amphitheatre and\njoining the platform of the idols. But he stopped suddenly as he\nemerged, not upon the tongue, but upon still another stairway.\n\nHe had gone astray, and out of his bursting lungs a cry of rage and\ndespair went up. For a moment he stood still. What use to proceed\nfurther?\n\nAnd then, amazingly, there came what might have been a sign from\nheaven. Down through a small, square opening overhead, no larger than\na ventilator, it came ... a glimmer of violet flame!\n\nAnd Jim hurled himself like a madman against the stairs, and\nsurmounted them with two bounds. There were no more. Instead, Jim\nfound himself looking down into the amphitheatre.\n\nThe thick walls had cut off all sound from his ears, save a confused\nmurmur, but now a hideous uproar assailed them. The whole floor of the\namphitheatre was a mass of moving shadows, of slayers and slain.\n\nThe Drilgoes had broken in and trapped the multitudes that had taken\nrefuge there. Their fearful stone-tipped spears thrust in and out, to\nthe accompaniment of their savage howls and the screams of the dying.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNever has such a shadow-play been seen, perhaps, as that below, where\ndeath stalked in dense darkness, and the slayer did not even see his\nvictim. Only the thrust of spears, the soft, yielding flesh that they\nencountered, the scream, the wrench of stone from tissue, and the\nblended howl of triumph and scream of despair.\n\nYet only for a moment did Jim turn his eyes upon that sight. For he\nknew where he was now. He had emerged upon the other side of the\namphitheatre, upon the platform where he had seen the priests and\ndignitaries gathered when he was led forward to be sacrificed.\n\nThere, in the rear, were the hideous, shadowy gods, looming up out of\nthe darkness, their outstretched arms interlaced. And there upon the\nplatform was the Atom Smasher, a little thread of violet light seeping\nout of the central tube.\n\nBeside it stood a group of figures, impossible to distinguish in the\ndarkness, but of a sudden Lucille's scream rang out above the din\nbelow.\n\nWith three leaps Jim was at her side. He saw the girl, Tode, and\nParrish, struggling in the grasp of a dozen priests. They were\ndragging them toward the idols, and Jim understood what that scene\nportended.\n\nIn despair at the irruption of the Drilgoes, the priests were seeking\nto propitiate their gods by sacrificing the three strangers whom they\nheld responsible for all their woes.\n\nJim caught Lucille in his arms, shouting her name. She knew him,\nturned toward him. Then one of the priests, armed with a great\nstone-headed club--for no metal is permitted within the precincts of\nthe god Cruk--struck at him furiously.\n\nJim leaped aside, letting the club descend harmlessly upon the floor.\nHe shot out his right with all his strength behind it, catching the\npriest upon the jaw, and the man crumpled.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhirling the club around his head, he fought back the fanatics, all\nthe while shouting to Tode to start the Atom Smasher. In such a moment\nhe only remembered that Tode was a white man, and of his own\ngeneration.\n\nHe struck down three of the priests; then he was seized around the\nknees from behind, and fell heavily. The club was wrenched from his\nhand. In another moment Jim found himself helpless in the grasp of the\nAtlanteans.\n\nAs he stopped struggling for a moment, to gather his strength for a\nsupreme effort, he heard a whir overhead, and saw the arms of the\nstone gods begin their horrible revolution. The priests had started\nthe machinery. And high above the din below rang out the wild chant of\nthe high priest.\n\nJim saw him now, a figure poised upon a platform behind the arms, his\nown arms raised heavenward.\n\n\"Aiah! Aiah! Aiah!\"\n\nJim was being dragged forward, with Lucille beside him, old Parrish\nfollowing, still making a futile struggle for life, while pitiful\nscreeches issued from his mouth.\n\nJim saw the revolving arms descend within a foot of his head. One more\nfight--one more, the last.\n\nSuddenly, with loud yells, a band of Drilgoes leaped forward from the\nhead of the stairs and rushed upon the struggling priests and victims.\nAnd, dark as it was, Jim recognized their leader--Cain.\n\nAnd Cain knew Lucille. As the priests rallied for a desperate\nresistance, Cain hurled his great body through the air, landing\nsquarely upon the shoulders of the priest nearest the revolving arms,\nand knocking him flat.\n\nThen the arms caught priest and Drilgo, and the steel hooks dug deep\ninto their flesh. A screech of terror, a howl that reverberated\nthrough the amphitheatre, and nothing remained of either but a heap\nof macerated flesh.\n\nBut in that instant Jim had fought free again. He caught Lucille and\ndragged her back toward the Atom Smasher.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTode had already broken from his captors and was working at it\nfrantically.\n\n\"Hold on!\" screeched old Parrish. \"Hold on!\"\n\nThey had a moment's leeway. The Drilgoes had driven the priests back\ninto the hooks. With awful shrieks the fanatics were yielding up their\nlives, in the place of their selected victims.\n\nBut more Drilgoes were pouring up the stairs. A moment's leeway, and\nno more, before the savage band would impale the four upon their\nstone-pointed spears. There was not the slightest chance that they\nwould be able to make their identity known.\n\n\"For God's sake hurry!\" Jim yelled in Tode's ear.\n\nThe wheels were revolving, a stream of violet light, leaping out of\nthe central tunnel, cast a lurid illumination upon the scene.\n\nBut it was too late. A score of Drilgoes, with leveled spears, were\nrushing on the four.\n\n\"Hold tight!\" screeched Parrish. He thrust his arm into his breast,\nand pulled out a little lever. Jim recognized it and remembered. It\nwas the instrument of universal death--the uranium release of untold\nforces of cataclysmic depredation.\n\n\"Take that!\" screamed the old man, inserting the lever into the secret\ngroove in the Atom Smasher and jerking it in the direction of the\npriests.\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n_Tode's Last Gamble_\n\nA roar that seemed to rend the heavens followed. Roar upon roar, as\nthe infinite momentum of the disintegrating uranium struck obstacle\nafter obstacle. The Drilgoes vanished, the amphitheatre melted away,\nwalls and roof.... Overhead were the moon and stars.\n\nAnd proud Atlantis was sinking into the depths of the sea.... Not as a\nship sinks, but piecemeal, her walls and towers crumbling and toppling\nas a child's sand-castle crumbles under the attack of the lapping\nwaves. Down they crashed, carrying their freight of black, clinging,\nhuman ants, while from the sea's depths a wave, a mile high, rose and\nbattered the fragments to destruction. From the crater of the volcano\na huge wave of fire fanned forward, and where fire and water met a\ncloud of steam rose up.\n\nA boiling chaos in which water and earth and fire were blended, spread\nover land and sea. And then suddenly it was ended. Where the last\nisland of the Atlantean continent had been, only the ocean was to be\nseen, placid beneath the stars.\n\nThe Atom Smasher was vibrating at tremendous speed. Jim, with one arm\nround Lucille, faced Tode at the instrument board. Near by sat\nParrish, watching him too.\n\n\"That took a whole year,\" said Tode. \"That pretty little scene of\ndestruction we've just witnessed. The good old Atom Smasher has been\ndoing some lively stunts, or we'd have been engulfed too. We're not\nlikely to see anything so pretty in history again, unless we go to\nwatch the destruction of Herculaneum and Pompeii by lava from\nVesuvius. But that would be quite tame in comparison with this.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTode's jeering tone grated on Jim's ears immeasurably.\n\n\"I don't think any of us are craving any more experiments, Tode,\" he\nsaid, trying to keep his voice steady. \"Suppose you take us back to\nPeconic Bay. We'll dump the Atom Smasher into the pond, and try to\nforget that we've had anything except a bad nightmare.\"\n\n\"Don't trust him, Jim,\" whispered Lucille.\n\nTode heard. \"Thank you,\" he answered, scowling. \"But seriously, Dent,\nwe can't go back with nothing to show for all our trouble. Those fools\ntried to betray me, and then the Eye went out. Perhaps I have you to\nthank for that performance? However, the sensible thing is to let\nbygones be bygones. But we must make a little excursion. How about\npicking up a little treasure from the hoards of Solomon or Genghis\nKhan? A few pounds of precious stones would make a world of difference\nin our social status when we reach Long Island.\"\n\nJim felt a cold fury permeating him. Tode saw his grim look and\nlaughed malignantly.\n\n\"Well, Dent, I'm ready to be frank with you,\" he said. \"The game's\nstill in my hands. I want Lucille. I'm willing to take you and Parrish\nback, provided you agree she shall be mine. I'll have to trust you,\nbut I shall have means of evening up if you play crooked.\"\n\n\"Why don't you ask my girl herself?\" piped old Parrish.\n\n\"He needn't trouble. He knows the answer!\" cried Lucille scornfully.\n\n\"There's your answer,\" said Jim. \"Now, what's the alternative?\"\n\n\"The alternative is, that I have already set the dial to eternity,\nDent,\" grinned Tode. \"Eternity in the fifth dimension. Didn't know I'd\nworked that out, did you? A pleasant little surprise. No, don't try to\nmove. My hand is on the lever. I have only to press it, and we're\nthere.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJim stood stock still in horror. Tode's voice rang true. He believed\nTode had the power he claimed.\n\n\"Yes, the fifth dimension, and eternity,\" said Tode, \"where time and\nspace reel into functionlessness. Don't ask me what it's like there.\nI've never been there. But my impression of it is that it's a fairly\ngood representation of the place popularly known as hell.\n\n\"You fool, Dent,\" Tode's voice rang out with vicious, snarling\nemphasis, \"I gave you your chance to come in with me. Together we'd\nhave made ourselves masters of Atlantis and brought back her plunder\nto our Twentieth Century world. You refused because of a girl--a girl,\nDent, who loved me long before you came upon the scene.\"\n\n\"That's a lie, Lucius,\" answered Lucille steadily. \"And you can do\nyour worst. There's one factor you haven't reckoned in your\ncalculations, and that's called God.\"\n\n\"The dark blur on the spectral lines,\" old Parrish muttered.\n\nTode laughed uproariously. \"Come, make your choice, Dent,\" he mocked.\n\"It's merely to press this lever. You'll find yourself--well, we won't\ngo into that. I don't know where you'll find yourself. You'll\ndisappear. So shall I. But I'm desperate. I must have Lucille.\nChoose!\" His voice rang out in maniac tones. \"Choose, all of you!\"\n\n\"Lucille has answered you,\" Jim retorted.\n\n\"And how about you, old man?\" called Tode to Parrish.\n\nParrish leased forward, making a swift movement with his hand. \"Go to\nyour own hell, you dev--\"\n\nA blinding light, a frantic oscillation of the Atom Smasher, a sense\nof death, awful and indescribable--and stark unconsciousness rushed\nover Jim. His last thought was that Lucille's arms were about him, and\nthat he was holding her. Nothing mattered, therefore, even though they\ntwo were plunged into that awful nothingness of the fifth dimension,\nwhere neither space nor time recognizably exists. Love could exist\nthere.\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n_Solid Earth_\n\n\"He's coming around, Lucille. Thank God for it!\"\n\nJim opened his eyes. For a few moments he looked about him without\nunderstanding. Then the outlines of a room etched themselves against\nthe clouded background. And in the foreground Lucille's face. The girl\nwas bending over Jim, one hand soothing his forehead.\n\n\"Where am I?\" Jim muttered.\n\n\"Back on earth, Jim, the good old earth, never again to leave it,\"\nanswered Lucille, with a catch in her voice. With an effort she\ncomposed herself. \"You mustn't talk,\" she said.\n\n\"But what place is this?\"\n\n\"It's Andy Lumm's house. Now rest, and I'll explain everything later.\"\n\nBut the first explanation came from Andy Lumm. \"Well, Mr. Dent, my\nwife and me sure were glad to be on the spot when you and Miss Parrish\ngot bogged on the edge of the Black Pool,\" he said. \"Mean, treacherous\nplace it is. Thar was a cow got mired thar last month, up to her\nbelly. If us hadn't found her, and dragged her out with ropes, she'd\nhave gone clear under. Granpop Dawes says thar's underground springs\naround the edge, and that it runs straight down to hell, though that\nseems sorter far-fetched to me.\n\n\"Yessir, and if I hadn't heard WNYC giving Miss Parrish on the list of\nmissing persons, and as having been seen near here, I reckon I'd never\nhave found you. Made me and my wife uneasy, that did. 'Andy,' she\nsays. 'I got an inkling you oughter go to the Vanishing Place and see\nif she ain't there.' And there I found you two, mired to the waist,\nand Mr. Parrish dancing around and fretting, and his clothes burned to\ncinders.\n\n\"It sure seems strange to me, to think Mr. Parrish got away safe after\nthat explosion five years ago, and of his wandering around with loss\nof memory, till you found him, and brung him back here to restore it,\nbut thar's strange things in the world--yes, sir, thar surely is!\"\n\nIn the happiness of being back on Earth once more, Jim was content to\nlet further explanations go. The return of Parrish had been duly\nchronicled in the newspapers, and had provoked a mild interest, but\nfortunately the public mind was so occupied at the moment with the\ntrial of a night club hostess that, after the first rush of newspaper\nmen, the three were left alone.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDay after day, in the brilliant autumn weather, Jim and Lucille would\nroam the tinted woods, recharging themselves with the feel of Earth,\nuntil the memory of those dread experiences grew dim.\n\n\"Well, Jim, I reckon I'd better tell you and get it over,\" said old\nParrish one morning--Parrish, quite his old, jaunty self again. \"Tode\nhad got the dials pointing to the fifth dimension--eternity, he called\nit, though actually I believe it's nothing more than annihilation, a\ngrand smash. Well, he pressed that lever. But something had gone\nwrong.\n\n\"You remember how poor Cain seemed to take great interest in the Atom\nSmasher. There's no way of telling what had been going on in that\nbrain of his, but it looks to me like he'd known that that lever meant\ndeath. It was sealed up in wax, and Tode had got it free on the way\nout of Atlantis.\n\n\"Well--this it what I made out from examining the thing afterward.\nCain had been monkeying with the lever. He'd pried loose one of the\nwires that hooked to the transformer, and short-circuited it, not\nknowing, of course, just what he was doing. The result was that when\nTode pressed that lever, instead of blowing the whole contraption to\npieces, he got a couple of billion volts of electricity through his\nbody, combined with a larger amperage than has ever been imagined. It\nburned him to a few grease spots. He simply--vanished. You don't\nremember what you did at the moment, boy?\"\n\n\"I don't seem to remember anything,\" said Jim.\n\n\"Well, your response was an automatic one. You jumped him. Luckily\nyou were too late, for Tode vanished like that!\" Old Parrish snapped\nhis fingers. \"But you must have got into the field of magnetic\nforce--any way, you were almost electrocuted. Lucille and I thought\nyou were dead for hours.\n\n\"We laid you down and set a course for home. I used those dial\nnumberings Tode had given me. He'd said they wouldn't work, but he'd\nlied. They did work. They brought us back to the Vanishing Place.\n\n\"We carried you out, and then I saw your eyelid twitch. We worked over\nyou with artificial respiration till it looked as if there was a\nchance for you. Then I shut off the power and let the waters rush in\nover the Atom Smasher, and swam ashore. And there it lies at the\nbottom of the pool, and may it lie there till the Judgment Day.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Tode was a genius,\" said Jim, \"but he never understood that character\ncounts for more than genius.\"\n\n\"Let's think no more about him,\" said Lucille. She had come up to\nthem, and the two looked at each other and smiled. Love is\nself-centred; other things it forgets very quickly.\n\n\"To-morrow we go back to New York,\" said Jim. \"You think you're able\nto face the world and take up life again?\"\n\n\"I think so, Jim,\" said Lucille.\n\n\"You're not remembering him after all?\"\n\n\"No, Jim. I was thinking of poor Cain. He died for me.\"\n\n\"But that was twelve thousand years ago, my dear, and to-day's\nto-day,\" said Jim. \"And to-morrow a new life begins for you and me.\"\n\nHe drew her closer to him. No, he would never quite forget, but that\nwas twelve thousand years ago ... and to-morrow was his wedding day.\n\n\n\n\n_A Meeting Place for Readers of_ Astounding Stories\n\n[Illustration: _The Readers' Corner_]\n\n\n_An \"Astounding\" Career_\n\nDear Editor:\n\n     A friend introduced me to your new magazine, and it is\n     wonderful. The best story in the magazine, or, rather, the\n     one I liked best, outside of the serial, which I didn't\n     read, is \"The Cave of Horror,\" by Capt. S. P. Meek. Next\n     comes Ray Cummings' story of the Fourth Dimension, \"Phantoms\n     of Reality.\" Other good ones are, \"Tanks,\" \"Invisible\n     Death,\" and \"Compensation.\"\n\n     I did not like \"The Stolen Mind.\" It seemed to me to be a\n     mixture of superstition and magic. A fairy tale. I am glad\n     that you are publishing this magazine, and I think that it\n     is worth double its present price. You have my good wishes\n     to the magazine for a long and astounding career. My way of\n     reading a serial is to save copies and to read the story at\n     one time. I do not like to wait a month for a story to end\n     or continue.\n\n     Your next issue seems to sound quite interesting. \"The Spawn\n     of the Stars,\" a very interesting and, I am sure, a fit name\n     for the story. \"Creatures of the Light\" is a very vague\n     name--you don't know what to expect. The others will prove\n     to be as interesting as any that I have named. I prefer\n     interplanetary stories the most, as any amount of science\n     can be injected in them.--Nathan Greenfield, 318 East 78th\n     St., New York, N. Y.\n\n\n_Prefers Long Stories_\n\nDear Editor:\n\n     I got your first issue of Astonishing Stories, and, although\n     I like the stories, I do not like the way you have it bound.\n     (This is supposed to be criticism, so don't take it to\n     heart.) The pages are uneven and hard to turn. But the\n     stories in the first copy were good. And you'll have a swell\n     magazine if you have stories by Harl Vincent and Ray\n     Cummings. The aforesaid men are two of the best in the\n     science fiction field. Another thing: don't have any short\n     stories. If you have about 3 or 4 l-o-n-g stories, I'd like\n     it better. I hope your magazine enjoys much success!--Linus\n     Hogenmiller, 502 N. Washington Street, Farmington, Mo.\n\n\n_Another Who Likes Interplanetary Stories_\n\nDear Editor:\n\n     I have read the first issue of Astounding Stories with much\n     pleasure, and if the first issue is any indication of what\n     is to follow I will continue to be a reader.\n\n     You inquire as to the kind of stories that your readers\n     think should be published. I think you will find the most\n     popular brand to be interplanetary stories and stories along\n     the line of the \"Beetle Horde.\" Best wishes for success in\n     your new endeavor--F. C. Cowherd, Room 333, L. & N.\n     Railroad, Louisville, Ky.\n\n\n_Attention, Joiners!_\n\nDear Editor:\n\n     I have just finished one of the stories in your magazine,\n     and could not resist the temptation to write and tell you\n     how much I enjoyed it. The stories are great and are just\n     the thing to give one rest and recreation. At the same time\n     they fire imagination and are not trashy love stories.\n\n     The main purpose of the letter is to revive an old idea and\n     see if I can put it through. I propose to organize a\n     correspondence society for readers interested in science. We\n     would use Astounding Stories as our official medium. Each\n     member would receive a list of members' names and addresses,\n     a quantity of official stationery for inter-correspondence,\n     and a certificate of membership suitable for framing.\n\n     The object would be the discussion of scientific topics and\n     the latest advances.\n\n     I would suggest an annual fee of $2.50 to cover the cost of\n     printing stationery, certificates, application forms, copy\n     of the constitution, lists of members and official pins.\n\n     All those interested in the formation of such a society are\n     earnestly requested to write me, giving suggestions as to a\n     suitable name, etc. They will receive full information, and\n     a sample of the certificate of membership and an application\n     form.\n\n     I trust you will publish this letter at your earliest\n     convenience--M. R. Bercovitch, B. Sc., 4643 St. Urbain\n     Street, Montreal, Canada.\n\n\n_Sound Criticism_\n\nDear Editor:\n\n     You ask for readers to write you regarding types of stories\n     desired. Well, I am an electrical engineer and of course\n     like my yarns to have a touch of science in them. Also I\n     like my authors to make an original contribution to whatever\n     theory of science they develop fictionally. This Ray\n     Cummings doesn't do in his very interesting story, \"Phantoms\n     of Reality.\" His beginning is palpably borrowed from Francis\n     Flagg's story, \"The Blue Dimension,\" which appeared in a\n     Science Fiction magazine in 1927. Flagg developed the theory\n     of vibrations, reverberation, etc., and contributed\n     something new to speculative science. Cummings merely seizes\n     this point and dives into a series of improbable adventures.\n\n     Now I am not quarrelling with their improbability: I like my\n     stories improbable, but I am asking for something more\n     original than the old rehash of kings and queens, intrigues,\n     and returning princes, etc. Again, Cummings seems to lack\n     enough scientific acumen to make his other world different\n     than this. Even a superficial thinker will readily see that\n     the terrain of the other world would not faithfully follow\n     our own in its salient features. However, forgive me for\n     knocking--the story wasn't so bad, and Cummings doubtless\n     can do better than this--or has.\n\n     \"The Beetle Horde\"--so far--is a gem, and holds the\n     interest. Furthermore, its science is splendid. I am looking\n     forward to its conclusion. \"The Cave of Horror\" is a damn\n     good yarn, well written, interest sustained: but I didn't\n     care for \"The Stolen Mind.\" The truth is that that\n     particular story didn't hang together very well. It left one\n     up in the air, as it were, and far from satisfied me. Too,\n     the science involved, to say the least of it, was not very\n     sound or plausibly put. In reading the story I felt that the\n     author was one who should be encouraged to write\n     more--nothing wrong with his imagination or ability to fling\n     words--but that he should be gently coerced into writing\n     with better continuity and intelligence. \"Compensation\"\n     didn't click--too loose--not compact enough. Splendid idea\n     ruined by hasty writing. Another author needing a gentle\n     hint. But \"Tanks\" was another sure-fire hit with me. Held me\n     to last word. The story sounded real.\n\n     So for the stories in your first issue. You see, on the\n     whole, I liked all of them. Still, I also like variety.\n     Can't you give us some of the Francis Flagg type of fiction?\n     H. Hyatt Verril is another of my favorites, also Dr. Keller\n     and Clara Harris. I have read mighty good tales by those\n     authors. I believe you could do worse than to run an\n     occasional H. G. Wells story, and if you gave us \"The First\n     Men in the Moon\" serially, I for one would be delighted. I\n     have tried in vain to get that story and never have. Well, I\n     guess I have said enough. Best wishes for the New Year. May\n     Astounding Stories grow and prosper--and its Editor.--C.\n     Harry Jaeger, 2900 Jeedan Road, Oakland, California.\n\n\n_Likes Interplanetary Stories_\n\nDear Editor:\n\n     Having read the first issue of Astounding Stories, I am\n     about to pronounce a sentence on it. It is guilty of being\n     \"Astounding\" to the Nth degree!\n\n     I enjoyed all the stories immensely and will be anxiously\n     awaiting the next issue.\n\n     Now as for some suggestions which I think would improve the\n     magazine.\n\n     I. Try to have an interplanetary story in each issue.\n\n     II. Publish a number of interesting letters concerning\n     Astounding Stories in each issue.\n\n     III. Have several illustrations in long stories.\n\n     I think this would improve the magazine, although it is\n     perfect just the way it is.\n\n     Hoping Astounding Stories has a long and successful\n     life!--Forrest Ackerman, 530 Staples Avenue, San Francisco,\n     Cal.\n\n\n_Watch the Coming Issues, Miss Miller!_\n\nDear Editor:\n\n     Saw your new magazine at the newsstand and bought it at\n     once. I like the following stories in this issue: \"The\n     Beetle Horde,\" \"Phantoms of Reality,\" \"The Stolen Mind.\" I\n     did not care much for the others, and least of all for\n     \"Tanks.\"\n\n     I believe that readers, like myself, who are interested in\n     scientific fantasies, prefer stories of interplanetary\n     travels and fourth dimensional stories, and variations of\n     these themes. Such as various space-ships and vibration\n     machines for visiting other planets and traveling backward\n     and forward in time. Stories of lost continents and of\n     strange races of people living in unknown places on our own\n     Earth are interesting also.\n\n     A magazine of this kind has unlimited possibilities for\n     stories of the aforementioned types, and I believe that\n     readers who buy magazines of these subjects expect to find\n     therein really Astounding Stories. Best wishes for the\n     success of your magazine!--Ruth Miller, St. Regis Hotel,\n     Cleveland, Ohio.\n\n\n\"_The Scienceers_\"\n\nDear Editor:\n\n     This is to inform you that we have formed a club which we\n     named \"The Scienceers.\" The object of this club is to bring\n     together members who are interested in science in general,\n     also to talk the stories of your magazine over. We have no\n     means of reaching those who are interested except through\n     your magazine. We hope you will grant us space to print this\n     letter in your magazine. We would appreciate it if every\n     reader of your magazine living in New York City or nearby\n     towns would drop us a card with his name and address. We\n     then would be able to send him information of our club. We\n     hope you will print this letter, as we are all readers of\n     your magazine.--Louis Wexeler, 1933 Woodbine Street,\n     Brooklyn, New York.\n\n\n_We Examine All Science Very Carefully_\n\nDear Editor:\n\n     In the first edition of your periodical, you invite\n     criticism from its readers. I am extremely pleased to note\n     that Ray Cummings is among its contributors. His short crisp\n     sentences and word pictures are most interesting. As to the\n     type of stories, I would not be particular; but there is one\n     thing which must be observed: Since this magazine is about\n     science every story must be examined to discover any false\n     statements by the author concerning present-day science.\n\n     I think that discoveries and inventions to be made in the\n     future--by the author, of course--cannot be censored.--James\n     Brodent, New York, N. Y.\n\n\n_Young Mr. Wright Writes In_\n\nDear Editor:\n\n     I am accepting your offer to write and tell you what kind of\n     stories I like. So I did.\n\n     I prefer stories of the Fourth Dimension.\n\n     I hope to find plenty of these fascinating stories in your\n     coming issues.--Billy Wright, Age 11, Sheppard Place,\n     Nashville, Tenn.\n\n\n_Likes His Science Fiction_\n\nDear Editor:\n\n     Allow me to congratulate you on your fine magazine, it being\n     one of the seven (more or less) magazines in print that are\n     the best on the market.\n\n     I am glad to say that I can't throw you any brickbats, only\n     bouquets, and thought I would tell you the kind of stories I\n     would like to see in \"our\" magazine, if I may take the\n     liberty of calling it that.\n\n     I like stories of the type A. Merritt and Edgar Rice\n     Burroughs write, particularly A. Merritt, and if you could\n     reprint \"Through the Dragon Glass,\" by A. Merritt, I wish\n     you would, and give it a cover illustration, as I have\n     everything by him except that one. Please give it a cover\n     illustration as well as any by Merritt and Burroughs you\n     ever print.\n\n     You certainly have a good title, and in my opinion the\n     magazine need not be changed one iota, except perhaps you\n     might have the background a different color every month;\n     that is, the background of the cover, using every color in\n     the solar spectrum, which might make it sell better, and, at\n     any rate, would make a nice looking magazine in my opinion.\n     Everything in Science Fiction that comes out I have to get,\n     and pretty soon I will have so much that I will probably\n     have to pay storage space for it. I have a pretty good\n     amount now; four stacks two feet high each, but I can't\n     resist it and will keep on buying as long as there is\n     anything in that line to buy, and as long as I can.\n\n     Put this in the proverbial waste-basket if you don't want to\n     print it, as that is probably its ultimate destination\n     anyway, as my ideas are not worth much or less than that.\n     But I do wish you would read it through and act on my\n     suggestions soon.\n\n     Thanks--from an ardent devourer of Science Fiction, who\n     reads everything in that line he can get his hands on, your\n     and our magazine being one of the best in that line.--Worth\n     K. Bryant, 406 North Third Street, Yakima, Washington.\n\n\n\"_A Great Magazine_\"\n\nDear Editor:\n\n     I have just come across a copy of your new magazine\n     Astounding Stories, and to say that it is a great magazine\n     is putting it mild. I enjoy stories of the distant future.\n     The first instalment of \"The Beetle Horde\" by Victor\n     Rousseau was great. I hope to hear more of this author in\n     coming issues. I would like to see stories by such authors\n     as Edgar Rice Burroughs, Harl Vincent, Otis Adelbert Kline,\n     Garret Smith, also Ray Cummings. I wish Astounding Stories a\n     long life.--Wilbert Moyer, 533 N. 7th Street, Allentown, Pa.\n\n\n_Mr. Anderson's Favorites_\n\nDear Editor:\n\n     Just a word referring to your \"What kind of stories do you\n     like?\" in Astounding Stories. I like stories with some facts\n     based on true science of to-day, but let the author's\n     imagination wander a little, because anything might be\n     possible to-morrow. I do not like love stories or much humor\n     in this type of stories.\n\n     Stories of other worlds or of the Fourth Dimension always\n     interest me, because there is no limit to the imagination\n     there.\n\n     Why not have a discussion column and print some of the\n     letters? It would encourage more to write, and give you\n     their opinion: and, whether good or bad, should help you\n     please the majority.\n\n     Some will maybe say the cover is too vivid--but that was\n     what attracted my eye when I picked it out from among many\n     others.\n\n     Most of your stories in the first edition were good. I liked\n     \"The Beetle Horde\" and \"Phantoms of Reality\" best. Also\n     noticed the \"Spawn of the Stars\" next issue, which sounds O.\n     K. Hoping you all success in this type of stories.--C. E.\n     Anderson, 3504 Colfax Avenue, Minneapolis, Minn.\n\n\n_A Young Reader's Favorites_\n\nDear Editor:\n\n     I am writing you, per your request in your first issue of\n     Astounding Stories. They are most entertaining. I have read\n     three of the stories and they are excellent. You asked the\n     readers to tell you the kind of stories we liked best. I\n     like stories that concern the future of aviation. I like\n     interplanetary stories, also the stories about the Fourth\n     Dimension. I like Cummings', Rousseau's, Leinster's Meek's,\n     Vincent's and Starzl's writing. Your magazine is sure worth\n     twenty cents. You could put more science in your stories.\n\n     Please hold H. Wesso, your artist. He can really draw. I\n     have seen his drawings in other magazines. And you may\n     console yourself with the thought that you have one\n     continuous reader. I feel that your magazine is going to be\n     a success. I am also expressing the thoughts of other\n     readers. I am only 15 years old, but I like to read good\n     science stories, nevertheless. I hope to see you in next\n     month's magazine.--Ward Elmore, 2912 Avenue J. Ft. Madison,\n     Iowa.\n\n\n_A Contented Reader_\n\nDear Editor:\n\n     Congratulations on your new publication, Astounding Stories.\n     I certainly enjoyed reading the January issue. I believe\n     that this magazine is the answer to the prayer of those\n     readers who are desirous of something different, something\n     unique. Another feature is that you are charging only 20\u00a2 a\n     copy for a magazine that is really worth several times that\n     amount. You may count on me as a steady buyer of the\n     Astounding Stories as long as future issues are up to the\n     standard of the January issue.\n\n     Let me urge you that you give us the magazine on time every\n     month. I do not want to postpone my enjoyment of reading the\n     Unique Magazine on the first Thursday of each month.\n\n     Keep up the good work, and remember me as a contented\n     reader of your publication--T. J. Creaff, Jr. P. O. Box 734,\n     Phoenix Arizona.\n\n\n\"_A Lallapaloozer_\"!\n\nDear Editor:\n\n     Well, I've got to say something, and I might as well get it\n     over with. Your new magazine, Astounding Stories, is a\n     Lallapaloozer. I'm sorry I didn't get the first edition of\n     the new magazine, but I suppose you have some in stock and\n     I'm sending in my twenty cents in stamps to get one. I might\n     as well tell you how I found out about this new wonder.\n\n     One dreary, dreary night I walked into my newsdealer's store\n     to get a paper. While there I happened to glance upon the\n     bookstand--I saw the word Astounding and, my curiosity\n     aroused, I walked over to the stand and pulled the magazine\n     out. Imagine my surprise and delight when I found out what\n     it was! Well, I bought the book then and there without even\n     taking a look inside. When I got home I opened the book, and\n     the first story that caught my eye was \"Old Crompton's\n     Secret,\" by Harl Vincent. I knew the story was good before I\n     read it, because I've read quite a few of Mr. Vincent's\n     novels and they were all excellent. The best stories I like\n     are interplanetary stories.\n\n     Why not have a \"Reader Talks\" in Astounding Stories, where\n     each reader gives his point of view on the stories in the\n     magazine? I know everyone would enjoy that, as it gives the\n     readers a chance to comment on stories and, also, see what\n     the other reader thinks about any story in particular.\n\n     I wish you success in your new enterprise and hope my first\n     edition of Astounding Stories arrives soon.--Joseph\n     Kankowsky, 35 Columbia Street, West Orange, New Jersey.\n\n\n\"_The Readers' Corner_\"\n\nAll Readers are extended a sincere and cordial invitation to \"come\nover in 'The Readers' Corner'\" and join in our monthly discussion of\nstories, authors, scientific principles and possibilities--everything\nthat's of common interest in connection with our Astounding Stories.\n\nAlthough from time to time the Editor may make a comment or so, this\nis a department primarily for Readers, and we want you to make full\nuse of it.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
