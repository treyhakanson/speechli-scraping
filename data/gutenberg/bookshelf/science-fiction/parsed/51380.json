For a moment, the\neffect was almost frightening: a silent picture of the beginning of\ncivilization challenging the end of it. Then a small boy caught up\nwith the dog and it rolled over enthusiastically at his feet and the\nscene was normal again.\n\nThe small boy, however, seemed definitely pre-civilization. He studied\nthe dog coldly and then inserted a thin metal tube under its eyelid and\npoked. The dog wagged its stumpy tail. The boy frowned, tightened his\ngrip on the tube and jabbed hard. The dog's tail thumped the cushiony\npavement and the four paws beat the air. The boy shortened his grip\nand suddenly jabbed the dog several times in the stomach. The stiff\ntube rebounded from the gray, hairless hide. The dog's face split in an\nupside-down grin, revealing formidable ivory fangs across which a long\nblack tongue lolled.\n\nThe boy regarded the tongue speculatively and pocketed the metal tube\nwith a grimace of utter disgust. He did not look up when someone\ncalled: \"Hi, Butch! Sic 'em, Darter, sic 'em!\"\n\nA larger small boy and a somewhat older one were approaching across the\nluxurious, neatly cropped grass, preceded by a hurtling shape that,\nexcept for a black hide, was a replica of Butch's gray dog.\n\nButch shrugged his shoulders resignedly and said in a bored voice:\n\"Kill 'em, Brute.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe gray dog hurled itself on Darter. Jaws gaped to get a hold on necks\nso short and thick as to be mere courtesy terms. They whirled like a\nfanged merry-go-round. Three more dogs, one white, one slate blue and\none pink, hurried up and tried to climb aboard.\n\nButch yawned.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" inquired Darter's master. \"I thought you liked dog\nfights, Butch.\"\n\n\"I do like dog fights,\" Butch said somberly, without looking around. \"I\ndon't like uninj fights. They're just a pretend, like everything else.\nNobody gets hurt. And look here, Joggy--and you, too, Hal--when you\ntalk to me, don't just say Butch. It's the Butcher, see?\"\n\n\"That's not exactly a functional name,\" Hal observed with the\njudiciousness of budding maturity, while Joggy said agreeably: \"All\nright, Butcher, I suppose you'd like to have lived way back when people\nwere hurting each other all the time so the blood came out?\"\n\n\"I certainly would,\" the Butcher replied. As Joggy and Hal turned back\nskeptically to watch the fight, he took out the metal tube, screwed\nup his face in a dreadful frown and jabbed himself in the hand. He\nsqueaked with pain and whisked the tube out of sight.\n\n\"A kid can't do anything any more,\" he announced dramatically. \"Can't\nbreak anything except the breakables they give him to break on purpose.\nCan't get dirty except in the dirt-pen--and they graduate him from that\nwhen he's two. Can't even be bitten by an uninj--it's contraprogrammed.\"\n\n\"Where'd you ever get so fixated on dirt?\" Hal asked in a gentle voice\nacquired from a robot adolescer.\n\n\"I've been reading a book about a kid called Huckleberry Finn,\" the\nButcher replied airily. \"A swell book. That guy got dirtier than\nanything.\" His eyes became dreamy. \"He even ate out of a garbage pail.\"\n\n\"What's a garbage pail?\"\n\n\"I don't know, but it sounds great.\"\n\nThe battling uninjes careened into them. Brute had Darter by the ear\nand was whirling him around hilariously.\n\n\"Aw, _quit_ it, Brute,\" the Butcher said in annoyance.\n\nBrute obediently loosed his hold and returned to his master, paying no\nattention to his adversary's efforts to renew the fight.\n\nThe Butcher looked Brute squarely in the eyes. \"You're making too much\nof a rumpus,\" he said. \"I want to think.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe kicked Brute in the face. The dog squirmed joyously at his feet.\n\n\"Look,\" Joggy said, \"you wouldn't hurt an uninj, for instance, would\nyou?\"\n\n\"How can you hurt something that's uninjurable?\" the Butcher demanded\nscathingly. \"An uninj isn't really a dog. It's just a lot of circuits\nand a micropack bedded in hyperplastic.\" He looked at Brute with\nguarded wistfulness.\n\n\"I don't know about that,\" Hal put in. \"I've heard an uninj is\nprogrammed with so many genuine canine reactions that it practically\nhas racial memory.\"\n\n\"I mean if you _could_ hurt an uninj,\" Joggy amended.\n\n\"Well, maybe I wouldn't,\" the Butcher admitted grudgingly. \"But shut\nup--I want to think.\"\n\n\"About what?\" Hal asked with saintly reasonableness.\n\nThe Butcher achieved a fearful frown. \"When I'm World Director,\" he\nsaid slowly, \"I'm going to have warfare again.\"\n\n\"You think so now,\" Hal told him. \"We all do at your age.\"\n\n\"We do not,\" the Butcher retorted. \"I bet _you_ didn't.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I was foolish, too,\" the older boy confessed readily. \"All\nnewborn organisms are self-centered and inconsiderate and ruthless.\nThey have to be. That's why we have uninjes to work out on, and death\ngames and fear houses, so that our emotions are cleared for adult\nconditioning. And it's just the same with newborn civilizations. Why,\nlong after atom power and the space drive were discovered, people\nkept having wars and revolutions. It took ages to condition them\ndifferently. Of course, you can't appreciate it this year, but Man's\ngreatest achievement was when he learned to automatically reject all\nviolent solutions to problems. You'll realize that when you're older.\"\n\n\"I will not!\" the Butcher countered hotly. \"I'm not going to be a\nsissy.\" Hal and Joggy blinked at the unfamiliar word. \"And what if we\nwere attacked by bloodthirsty monsters from outside the Solar System?\"\n\n\"The Space Fleet would take care of them,\" Hal replied calmly. \"That's\nwhat it's for. Adults aren't conditioned to reject violent solutions to\nproblems where non-human enemies are concerned. Look at what we did to\nviruses.\"\n\n\"But what if somebody got at us through the Time Bubble?\"\n\n\"They can't. It's impossible.\"\n\n\"Yes, but suppose they did all the same.\"\n\n\"You've never been inside the Time Theater--you're not old enough\nyet--so you just can't know anything about it or about the reasons\nwhy it's impossible,\" Hal replied with friendly factuality. \"The Time\nBubble is just a viewer. You can only look through it, and just into\nthe past, at that. But you can't travel through it because you can't\nchange the past. Time traveling is a lot of kid stuff.\"\n\n\"I don't care,\" the Butcher asserted obstinately. \"I'm still going to\nhave warfare when I'm World Director.\"\n\n\"They'll condition you out of the idea,\" Hal assured him.\n\n\"They will not. I won't let 'em.\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter what you think now,\" Hal said with finality. \"You'll\nhave an altogether different opinion when you're six.\"\n\n\"Well, what if I will?\" the Butcher snapped back. \"You don't have to\nkeep _telling_ me about it, do you?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe others were silent. Joggy began to bounce up and down abstractedly\non the resilient pavement. Hal called in his three uninjes and said\nin soothing tones: \"Joggy and I are going to swim over to the Time\nTheater. Want to walk us there, Butch?\"\n\nButch scowled.\n\n\"How about it, Butch?\"\n\nStill Butch did not seem to hear.\n\nThe older boy shrugged and said: \"Oh, well, how about it--Butcher?\"\n\nThe Butcher swung around. \"They won't let me in the Time Theater. You\nsaid so yourself.\"\n\n\"You could walk us over there.\"\n\n\"Well, maybe I will and maybe I won't.\"\n\n\"While you're deciding, we'll get swimming. Come along, Joggy.\"\n\nStill scowling, the Butcher took a white soapy crayon from the bulging\npocket in his silver shorts. Pressed into the pavement, it made a\nblack mark. He scrawled pensively: KEEP ON THE GRASS.\n\nHe gazed at his handiwork. No, darn it, that was just what grownups\nwanted you to do. This grass couldn't be hurt. You couldn't pull it up\nor tear it off; it hurt your fingers to try. A rub with the side of the\ncrayon removed the sign. He thought for a moment, then wrote: KEEP OFF\nTHE GRASS.\n\nWith an untroubled countenance, he sprang up and hurried after the\nothers.\n\nJoggy and the older boy were swimming lazily through the air at\nshoulder height. In the pavement directly under each of them was a\nwide, saucer-shaped depression which swam along with them. The uninjes\navoided the depressions. Darter was strutting on his hind legs, looking\nup inquiringly at his master.\n\n\"Gimme a ride, Hal, gimme a ride!\" the Butcher called. The older boy\nignored him. \"Aw, gimme a ride, Joggy.\"\n\n\"Oh, all right.\" Joggy touched the small box attached to the front of\nhis broad metal harness and dropped lightly to the ground. The Butcher\nclimbed on his back. There was a moment of rocking and pitching, during\nwhich each boy accused the other of trying to upset them.\n\nThen the Butcher got his balance and they began to swim along\nsecurely, though at a level several inches lower. Brute sprang up after\nhis master and was invisibly rebuffed. He retired baffled, but a few\nminutes later, he was amusing himself by furious futile efforts to\nclimb the hemispherical repulsor field.\n\nSlowly the little cavalcade of boys and uninjes proceeded down the\nAvenue of Wisdom. Hal amused himself by stroking toward a tree. When he\nwas about four feet from it, he was gently bounced away.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was really a more tiring method of transportation than walking\nand quite useless against the wind. True, by rocking the repulsor\nhemisphere backward, you could get a brief forward push, but it would\nbe nullified when you rocked forward. A slow swimming stroke was the\nsimplest way to make progress.\n\nThe general sensation, however, was delightful and levitators were\namong the most prized of toys.\n\n\"There's the Theater,\" Joggy announced.\n\n\"I _know_,\" the Butcher said irritably.\n\nBut even he sounded a little solemn and subdued. From the Great Ramp\nto the topmost airy finial, the Time Theater was the dream of a god\nrealized in unearthly substance. It imparted the aura of demigods to\nthe adults drifting up and down the ramp.\n\n\"My father remembers when there wasn't a Time Theater,\" Hal said softly\nas he scanned the facade's glowing charts and maps. \"Say, they're\nviewing Earth, somewhere in Scandinavia around zero in the B.C.-A.D.\ntime scale. It should be interesting.\"\n\n\"Will it be about Napoleon?\" the Butcher asked eagerly. \"Or Hitler?\" A\nred-headed adult heard and smiled and paused to watch. A lock of hair\nhad fallen down the middle of the Butcher's forehead, and as he sat\nJoggy like a charger, he did bear a faint resemblance to one of the\ngrim little egomaniacs of the Dawn Era.\n\n\"Wrong millennium,\" Hal said.\n\n\"Tamerlane then?\" the Butcher pressed. \"He killed cities and piled the\nskulls. Blood-bath stuff. Oh, yes, and Tamerlane was a Scand of the\nNavies.\"\n\nHal looked puzzled and then quickly erased the expression. \"Well, even\nif it is about Tamerlane, you can't see it. How about it, Joggy?\"\n\n\"They won't let me in, either.\"\n\n\"Yes, they will. You're five years old now.\"\n\n\"But I don't feel any older,\" Joggy replied doubtfully.\n\n\"The feeling comes at six. Don't worry, the usher will notice the\ndifference.\"\n\nHal and Joggy switched off their levitators and dropped to their\nfeet. The Butcher came down rather hard, twisting an ankle. He opened\nhis mouth to cry, then abruptly closed it hard, bearing his pain in\ntight-lipped silence like an ancient soldier--like Stalin, maybe, he\nthought. The red-headed adult's face twitched in half-humorous sympathy.\n\nHal and Joggy mounted the Ramp and entered a twilit corridor which\ndrank their faint footsteps and returned pulses of light. The Butcher\nlimped manfully after them, but when he got inside, he forgot his\nbattle injury.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHal looked back. \"Honestly, the usher will stop you.\"\n\nThe Butcher shook his head. \"I'm going to think my way in. I'm going to\nthink old.\"\n\n\"You won't be able to fool the usher, Butcher. You under-fives\nsimply aren't allowed in the Time Theater. There's a good reason for\nit--something dangerous might happen if an under-five got inside.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"I don't exactly know, but something.\"\n\n\"Hah! I bet they're scared we'd go traveling in the Time Bubble and\nhave some excitement.\"\n\n\"They are not. I guess they just know you'd get bored and wander away\nfrom your seats and maybe disturb the adults or upset the electronics\nor something. But don't worry about it, Butcher. The usher will take\ncare of you.\"\n\n\"Shut up--I'm thinking I'm World Director,\" the Butcher informed them,\ncontorting his face diabolically.\n\nHal spoke to the uninjes, pointing to the side of the corridor.\nObediently four of them lined up.\n\nBut Brute was peering down the corridor toward where it merged into a\ndeeper darkness. His short legs stiffened, his neckless head seemed to\nretreat even further between his powerful shoulders, his lips writhed\nback to show his gleaming fangs, and a completely unfamiliar sound\nissued from his throat. A choked, grating sound. A growl. The other\nuninjes moved uneasily.\n\n\"Do you suppose something's the matter with his circuits?\" Joggy\nwhispered. \"Maybe he's getting racial memories from the Scands.\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" Hal said irritably.\n\n\"Brute, get over there,\" the Butcher commanded. Unwillingly, eyes still\nfixed on the blackness ahead, Brute obeyed.\n\nThe three boys started on. Hal and Joggy experienced a vaguely\nelectrical tingling that vanished almost immediately. They looked back.\nThe Butcher had been stopped by an invisible wall.\n\n\"I told you you couldn't fool the usher,\" Hal said.\n\nThe Butcher hurled himself forward. The wall gave a little, then\nbounced him back with equal force.\n\n\"I bet it'll be a bum time view anyway,\" the Butcher said, not giving\nup, but not trying again. \"And I still don't think the usher can tell\nhow old you are. I bet there's an over-age teacher spying on you\nthrough a hole, and if he doesn't like your looks, he switches on the\nusher.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut the others had disappeared in the blackness. The Butcher waited and\nthen sat down beside the uninjes. Brute laid his head on his knee and\ngrowled faintly down the corridor.\n\n\"Take it easy, Brute,\" the Butcher consoled him. \"I don't think\nTamerlane was really a Scand of the Navies anyhow.\"\n\nTwo chattering girls hardly bigger than himself stepped through the\nusher as if it weren't there.\n\nThe Butcher grimly slipped out the metal tube and put it to his lips.\nThere were two closely spaced faint _plops_ and a large green stain\nappeared on the bare back of one girl, while purple fluid dripped from\nthe close-cropped hair of the other.\n\nThey glared at him and one of them said: \"A cub!\" But he had his arms\nfolded and wasn't looking at them.\n\nMeanwhile, subordinate ushers had guided Hal and Joggy away from the\nmain entrance to the Time Theater. A sphincter dilated and they found\nthemselves in a small transparent cubicle from which they could watch\nthe show without disturbing the adult audience. They unstrapped their\nlevitators, laid them on the floor and sat down.\n\nThe darkened auditorium was circular. Rising from a low central\nplatform was a huge bubble of light, its lower surface somewhat\nflattened. The audience was seated in concentric rows around the\nbubble, their keen and compassionate faces dimly revealed by the pale\ncentral glow.\n\nBut it was the scene within the bubble that riveted the attention of\nthe boys.\n\nGreat brooding trees, the trunks of the nearer ones sliced by the\nbubble's surface, formed the background. Through the dark, wet foliage\nappeared glimpses of a murky sky, while from the ceiling of the bubble,\na ceaseless rain dripped mournfully. A hooded figure crouched beside a\nlittle fire partly shielded by a gnarled trunk. Squatting round about\nwere wiry, blue-eyed men with shoulder-length blond hair and full blond\nbeards. They were clothed in furs and metal-studded leather.\n\nHere and there were scattered weapons and armor--long swords glistening\nwith oil to guard them from rust, crudely painted circular shields, and\nhelmets from which curved the horns of beasts. Back and forth, lean,\nwolflike dogs paced with restless monotony.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSometimes the men seemed to speak together, or one would rise to peer\ndown the misty forest vistas, but mostly they were motionless. Only\nthe hooded figure, which they seemed to regard with a mingled wonder\nand fear, swayed incessantly to the rhythm of some unheard chant.\n\n\"The Time Bubble has been brought to rest in one of the barbaric\ncultures of the Dawn Era,\" a soft voice explained, so casually that\nJoggy looked around for the speaker, until Hal nudged him sharply,\nwhispering with barely perceptible embarrassment: \"Don't do that,\nJoggy. It's just the electronic interpreter. It senses our development\nand hears our questions and then it automats background and answers.\nBut it's no more alive than an adolescer or a kinderobot. Got a billion\nmicrotapes, though.\"\n\nThe interpreter continued: \"The skin-clad men we are viewing in Time\nin the Round seem to be a group of warriors of the sort who lived\nby pillage and rapine. The hooded figure is a most unusual find. We\nbelieve it to be that of a sorcerer who pretended to control the forces\nof nature and see into the future.\"\n\nJoggy whispered: \"How is it that we can't see the audience through the\nother side of the bubble? We can see through this side, all right.\"\n\n\"The bubble only shines light out,\" Hal told him hurriedly, to show he\nknew some things as well as the interpreter. \"Nothing, not even light,\ncan get into the bubble from outside. The audience on the other side of\nthe bubble sees into it just as we do, only they're seeing the other\nway--for instance, they can't see the fire because the tree is in the\nway. And instead of seeing us beyond, they see more trees and sky.\"\n\nJoggy nodded. \"You mean that whatever way you look at the bubble, it's\na kind of hole through time?\"\n\n\"That's right.\" Hal cleared his throat and recited: \"The bubble is the\nlocus of an infinite number of one-way holes, all centering around two\npoints in space-time, one now and one then. The bubble looks completely\nopen, but if you tried to step inside, you'd be stopped--and so would\nan atom beam. It takes more energy than an atom beam just to maintain\nthe bubble, let alone maneuver it.\"\n\n\"I see, I guess,\" Joggy whispered. \"But if the hole works for light,\nwhy can't the people inside the bubble step out of it into our world?\"\n\n\"Why--er--you see, Joggy--\"\n\nThe interpreter took over. \"The holes are one-way for light, but no-way\nfor matter. If one of the individuals inside the bubble walked toward\nyou, he would cross-section and disappear. But to the audience on the\nopposite side of the bubble, it would be obvious that he had walked\naway along the vista down which they are peering.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs if to provide an example, a figure suddenly materialized on\ntheir side of the bubble. The wolflike dogs bared their fangs. For\nan instant, there was only an eerie, distorted, rapidly growing\nsilhouette, changing from blood-red to black as the boundary of the\nbubble cross-sectioned the intruding figure. Then they recognized the\nback of another long-haired warrior and realized that the audience on\nthe other side of the bubble had probably seen him approaching for some\ntime.\n\nHe bowed to the hooded figure and handed him a small bag.\n\n\"More atavistic cubs, big and little! Hold still, Cynthia,\" a new voice\ncut in.\n\nHal turned and saw that two cold-eyed girls had been ushered into the\ncubicle. One was wiping her close-cropped hair with one hand while\nmopping a green stain from her friend's back with the other.\n\nHal nudged Joggy and whispered: \"Butch!\"\n\nBut Joggy was still hypnotized by the Time Bubble.\n\n\"Then how is it, Hal,\" he asked, \"that light comes out of the bubble,\nif the people don't? What I mean is, if one of the people walks toward\nus, he shrinks to a red blot and disappears. Why doesn't the light\ncoming our way disappear, too?\"\n\n\"Well--you see, Joggy, it isn't real light. It's--\"\n\nOnce more the interpreter helped him out.\n\n\"The light that comes from the bubble is an isotope. Like atoms of\none element, photons of a single frequency also have isotopes. It's\nmore than a matter of polarization. One of these isotopes of light\ntends to leak futureward through holes in space-time. Most of the\nlight goes down the vistas visible to the other side of the audience.\nBut one isotope is diverted through the walls of the bubble into the\nTime Theater. Perhaps, because of the intense darkness of the theater,\nyou haven't realized how dimly lit the scene is. That's because we're\ngetting only a single isotope of the original light. Incidentally, no\nisotopes have been discovered that leak pastward, though attempts are\nbeing made to synthesize them.\"\n\n\"Oh, explanations!\" murmured one of the newly arrived girls. \"The cubs\nare always angling for them. Apple-polishers!\"\n\n\"_I_ like this show,\" a familiar voice announced serenely. \"They cut\nanybody yet with those choppers?\"\n\nHal looked down beside him. \"Butch! How did you manage to get in?\"\n\n\"I don't see any blood. Where's the bodies?\"\n\n\"But how _did_ you get in--Butcher?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Butcher replied airily: \"A red-headed man talked to me and said it\ncertainly was sad for a future dictator not to be able to enjoy scenes\nof carnage in his youth, so I told him I'd been inside the Time Theater\nand just come out to get a drink of water and go to the eliminator, but\nthen my sprained ankle had got worse--I kind of tried to get up and\nfell down again--so he picked me up and carried me right through the\nusher.\"\n\n\"Butcher, that wasn't honest,\" Hal said a little worriedly. \"You\ntricked him into thinking you were older and his brain waves blanketed\nyours, going through the usher. I really _have_ heard it's dangerous\nfor you under-fives to be in here.\"\n\n\"The way those cubs beg for babying and get it!\" one of the girls\ncommented. \"Talk about sex favoritism!\" She and her companion withdrew\nto the far end of the cubicle.\n\nThe Butcher grinned at them briefly and concentrated his attention on\nthe scene in the Time Bubble.\n\n\"Those big dogs--\" he began suddenly. \"Brute must have smelled 'em.\"\n\n\"Don't be silly,\" Hal said. \"Smells can't come out of the Time Bubble.\nSmells haven't any isotopes and--\"\n\n\"I don't care,\" the Butcher asserted. \"I bet somebody'll figure out\nsomeday how to use the bubble for time traveling.\"\n\n\"You can't travel in a point of view,\" Hal contradicted, \"and that's\nall the bubble is. Besides, some scientists think the bubble isn't real\nat all, but a--uh--\"\n\n\"I believe,\" the interpreter cut in smoothly, \"that you're thinking\nof the theory that the Time Bubble operates by hypermemory. Some\nscientists would have us believe that all memory is time traveling and\nthat the basic location of the bubble is not space-time at all, but\never-present eternity. Some of them go so far as to state that it is\nonly a mental inability that prevents the Time Bubble from being used\nfor time traveling--just as it may be a similar disability that keeps\na robot with the same or even more scopeful memories from being a real\nman or animal.\n\n\"It is because of this minority theory that under-age individuals and\nother beings with impulsive mentalities are barred from the Time\nTheater. But do not be alarmed. Even if the minority theory should\nprove true--and no evidence for it has ever appeared--there are\nautomatically operating safeguards to protect the audience from any\nharmful consequences of time traveling (almost certainly impossible,\nremember) in either direction.\"\n\n\"Sissies!\" was the Butcher's comment.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You're rather young to be here, aren't you?\" the interpreter inquired.\n\nThe Butcher folded his arms and scowled.\n\nThe interpreter hesitated almost humanly, probably snatching through a\nquarter-million microtapes. \"Well, you wouldn't have got in unless a\nqualified adult had certified you as plus-age. Enjoy yourself.\"\n\nThere was no need for the last injunction. The scene within the bubble\nhad acquired a gripping interest. The shaggy warriors were taking up\ntheir swords, gathering about the hooded sorcerer. The hood fell back,\nrevealing a face with hawklike, disturbing eyes that seemed to be\nlooking straight out of the bubble at the future.\n\n\"This is getting good,\" the Butcher said, squirming toward the edge of\nhis seat.\n\n\"Stop being an impulsive mentality,\" Hal warned him a little nervously.\n\n\"Hah!\"\n\nThe sorcerer emptied the small bag on the fire and a thick cloud of\nsmoke puffed toward the ceiling of the bubble. A clawlike hand waved\nwildly. The sorcerer appeared to be expostulating, commanding. The\nwarriors stared uncomprehendingly, which seemed to exasperate the\nsorcerer.\n\n\"That's right,\" the Butcher approved loudly. \"Sock it to 'em!\"\n\n\"Butcher!\" Hal admonished.\n\nSuddenly the bubble grew very bright, as if the Sun had just shone\nforth in the ancient world, though the rain still dripped down.\n\n\"A viewing anomaly has occurred,\" the interpreter announced. \"It may be\nnecessary to collapse the Time Bubble for a short period.\"\n\nIn a frenzy, his ragged robes twisting like smoke, the sorcerer rushed\nat one of the warriors, pushing him backward so that in a moment he\nmust cross-section.\n\n\"Attaboy!\" the Butcher encouraged.\n\nThen the warrior was standing outside the bubble, blinking toward the\nshadows, rain dripping from his beard and furs.\n\n\"Oh, _boy_!\" the Butcher cheered in ecstasy.\n\n\"Butcher, you've done it!\" Hal said, aghast.\n\n\"I sure did,\" the Butcher agreed blandly, \"but that old guy in the\nbubble helped me. Must take two to work it.\"\n\n\"Keep your seats!\" the interpreter said loudly. \"We are energizing the\nsafeguards!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe warriors inside the bubble stared in stupid astonishment after the\none who had disappeared from their view. The sorcerer leaped about,\npushing them in his direction.\n\nAbrupt light flooded the Time Theater. The warriors who had emerged\nfrom the bubble stiffened themselves, baring their teeth.\n\n\"The safeguards are now energized,\" the interpreter said.\n\nA woman in a short golden tunic stood up uncertainly from the front row\nof the audience.\n\nThe first warrior looked her up and down, took one hesitant step\nforward, then another, then suddenly grabbed her and flung her over his\nleft shoulder, looking around menacingly and swinging his sword in his\nright hand.\n\n\"I repeat, the safeguards have been fully energized! Keep your seats!\"\nthe interpreter enjoined.\n\nIn the cubicle, Hal and Joggy gasped, the two girls squeaked, but the\nButcher yelled a \"Hey!\" of disapproval, snatched up something from the\nfloor and darted out through the sphincter.\n\nHere and there in the audience, other adults stood up. The emerged\nwarriors formed a ring of swinging swords and questing eyes. Between\ntheir legs their wolfish dogs, emerged with them, crouched and snarled.\nThen the warriors began to fan out.\n\n\"There has been an unavoidable delay in energizing the safeguards,\" the\ninterpreter said. \"Please be patient.\"\n\nAt that moment, the Butcher entered the main auditorium, brandishing a\nlevitator above his head and striding purposefully down the aisle. At\nhis heels, five stocky forms trotted. In a definitely pre-civilization\nvoice, or at least with pre-civilization volume, he bellowed: \"Hey,\nyou! You quit that!\"\n\nThe first warrior looked toward him, gave his left shoulder a shake to\nquiet his wriggling captive, gave his right shoulder one to supple his\nsword arm, and waited until the dwarfish challenger came into range.\nThen his sword swished down in a flashing arc.\n\nNext moment, the Butcher was on his knees and the warrior was staring\nat him open-mouthed. The sword had rebounded from something invisible\nan arm's length above the gnomelike creature's head. The warrior backed\na step.\n\nThe Butcher stayed down, crouching half behind an aisle seat and\ndigging for something in his pocket. But he didn't stay quiet. \"Sic\n'em, Brute!\" he shrilled. \"Sic 'em, Darter! Sic 'em, Pinkie and Whitie\nand Blue!\" Then he stopped shouting and raised his hand to his mouth.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGrowling quite unmechanically, the five uninjes hurled themselves\nforward and closed with the warrior's wolflike dogs. At the first\nencounter, Brute and Pinkie were grabbed by the throats, shaken, and\ntossed a dozen feet. The warriors snarled approval and advanced. But\nthen Brute and Pinkie raced back eagerly to the fight--and suddenly the\nface of the leading warrior was drenched with scarlet. He blinked and\ntouched his fingers to it, then looked at his hand in horror.\n\nThe Butcher spared a second to repeat his command to the uninjes. But\nalready the battle was going against the larger dogs. The latter had\nthe advantage of weight and could toss the smaller dogs like so many\nfoxes. But their terrible fangs did no damage, and whenever an uninj\nclamped on a throat, that throat was torn out.\n\nMeanwhile, great bloody stains had appeared on the bodies of all the\nwarriors. They drew back in a knot, looking at each other fearfully.\nThat was when the Butcher got to his feet and strode forward, hand\nclenching the levitator above his head.\n\n\"Get back where you belong, you big jerks! And drop that lady!\"\n\nThe first warrior pointed toward him and hissed something. Immediately,\na half dozen swords were smiting at the Butcher.\n\n\"We are working to energize the safeguards,\" the interpreter said in\nmechanical panic. \"Remain patient and in your seats.\"\n\nThe uninjes leaped into the melee, at first tearing more fur than\nflesh. Swords caught them and sent them spinning through the air. They\ncame yapping back for more. Brute fixed on the first warrior's ankle.\nHe dropped the woman, stamped unavailingly on the uninj, and let out a\nscreech.\n\nSwords were still rebounding from the invisible shield under which the\nButcher crouched, making terrible faces at his attackers. They drew\nback, looked again at their bloodstains, goggled at the demon dogs.\nAt their leader's screech, they broke and plunged back into the Time\nBubble, their leader stumbling limpingly after them. There they wasted\nno time on their own ragged sorcerer. Their swords rose and fell, and\nno repulsor field stayed them.\n\n\"Brute, come back!\" the Butcher yelled.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe gray uninj let go his hold on the leader's ankle and scampered\nout of the Time Bubble, which swiftly dimmed to its original light\nintensity and then winked out.\n\nFor once in their very mature lives, all of the adults in the\nauditorium began to jabber at each other simultaneously.\n\n\"We are sorry, but the anomaly has made it necessary to collapse the\nTime Bubble,\" the interpreter said. \"There will be no viewing until\nfurther announcement. Thank you for your patience.\"\n\nHal and Joggy caught up with the Butcher just as Brute jumped into his\narms and the woman in gold picked him up and hugged him fiercely. The\nButcher started to pull away, then grudgingly submitted.\n\n\"Cubs!\" came a small cold voice from behind Hal and Joggy. \"Always\nplaying hero! Say, what's that awful smell, Cynthia? It must have come\nfrom those dirty past men.\"\n\nHal and Joggy were shouting at the Butcher, but he wasn't listening\nto them or to the older voices clamoring about \"revised theories of\nreality\" and other important things. He didn't even squirm as Brute\nlicked his cheek and the woman in gold planted a big kiss practically\non his mouth.\n\nHe smiled dreamily and stroked Brute's muzzle and murmured softly: \"We\ncame, we saw, we conquered, didn't we, Brute?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Time In the Round, by Fritz Leiber\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK TIME IN THE ROUND ***\n\n***** This file should be named 51380.txt or 51380.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/1/3/8/51380/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
