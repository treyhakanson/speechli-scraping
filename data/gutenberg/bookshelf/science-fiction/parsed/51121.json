As\nfar as Carol Marsh was concerned, he was ordinary enough in appearance.\nAnd she wasn't ordinarily attracted to ordinary men.\n\nHe was slightly over medium height, his features were not quite\nregular, and he had a deep tan over what had started out as a sunburn,\nso that she decided he had misjudged the strength of the sun on some\nplanet with a thin atmosphere.\n\nShe frowned as she watched him look around. She was annoyed by the fact\nthat it took him almost a minute to get his bearings and realize that\nshe was first, a human being and second, a girl well worth a man's\nattention.\n\nEven the troubled expression in his eyes was something she held\nagainst him. A man shouldn't look troubled. A man should be confident,\nself-assured in a manner that also assured the girl he spoke to.\nShe remembered that back on Earth John Burr had been completely\nself-assured.\n\nIt was startling to realize that it was with this newcomer, whose\nappearance she had every reason to dislike, that she had fallen\nsuddenly and completely in love, as suddenly and completely as if she\nhad fallen off a cliff.\n\n\"I'm looking for some people,\" he said. \"But I suppose--\" His very\nvoice was ill at ease, and that was something else she should have held\nagainst him. And against herself. She had always resented men whose\nvoices betrayed their lack of confidence. \"I suppose it's no use,\" he\nwent on. \"I'd recognize the house.\"\n\n\"Who are the people you're looking for?\"\n\nHe took out a wallet, and from it drew a stereo picture. Two children,\na boy and a girl, were standing with a smiling young woman in front\nof a sturdy, old-fashioned plastic house. Their clothes were out of\nfashion by a year or so, but that depended on where you were. Mars, for\ninstance, was always three years behind Earth. Here on Ganymede, on the\nother hand, you might even be ahead of Earth in some respects.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs Carol's eyes lifted to his, she saw him staring at the picture with\nsuch longing that she at once knew herself for a fool. _They're his\nwife and children_, she thought. _He's trying to find them. And I had\nto fall in love with him at first sight._\n\nHis eyes were on her now, and she said, \"I'm sorry, I've never seen\nthem.\"\n\n\"Have you lived around here long?\"\n\n\"Five years.\"\n\n\"Then this can't be the place.\" He stood there irresolutely and started\nto turn slowly away without even a word of thanks to her.\n\n\"My father may have heard about them,\" said Carol, knowing herself for\na fool again.\n\nPast experience, she told herself ruefully, had taught her nothing. The\nthing to do was to let him go and forget him as quickly as possible,\nbefore she learned anything about him, before her feeling for him\ncould become anything more than an irrational, momentary impulse. The\nstronger the bonds of knowledge and interest between them, the more\npainful they would be to break. And the breaking was inevitable.\n\nThe house where she and her father lived was a simple dome-shaped\nbuilding, its walls and furniture both made of a silicon plastic whose\nraw materials had come from the ground on which it stood. There were\nrugs and draperies of a slightly different composition, woven on the\nall-purpose Household Helper that her father had bought before leaving\nEarth. They lived comfortably enough, she thought, as she led the man\nin.\n\nBut he hardly noticed the house or anything in it. When they reached\nthe library and her father looked up from the book he was reading,\nonly then did the man display interest. The book was a favorite of her\nfather's and it made him unhappy to cut his reading short.\n\nNevertheless, he turned off the projector, stood up, and said, \"Yes,\nCarol?\"\n\n\"This man is looking for some--some friends of his, Dad. I thought you\nmight be able to help him.\"\n\nShe held out the picture and, to her relief, her father stared at that\ninstead of at her. Sometimes he was a little too shrewd; if she was\nmaking a fool of herself, there was no need for him to know it. He\ncould be a sardonic man and he did not suffer fools gladly, even in his\nown family. He was of the opinion that she had used up her quota of\nfoolishness with John Burr.\n\nHe was shaking his head. \"Sorry, I've never seen them. Are you sure\nthey live around here?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the man. \"I'm not sure. I'm not sure of anything, except\nthat they're my wife and kids. And I've got to find them.\"\n\n\"Have you checked at the District Office?\"\n\n\"I did that first. They couldn't help me, but they said their records\nweren't complete yet.\"\n\n\"They're complete enough, I should think. Maybe they don't list every\nprospector who wanders around without settling down, but they wouldn't\nbe likely to miss a woman and two children. I'm afraid that you're\nwasting your time looking on Ganymede.\"\n\nThe man's face clouded. \"It isn't a waste of my time,\" he said. \"I've\ngot nothing else to do with it. And I have to find them. They need me.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMr. Marsh looked away from the man to his daughter, and Carol was a\nlittle slow in avoiding his eyes. \"I see,\" he said, and she had an idea\nof what he meant by that. He saw too much.\n\nIf he knew, there was nothing she could do about it. She said, \"Perhaps\nMr.--\"\n\nShe paused, and the man said dully, \"Callendar.\"\n\n\"Perhaps if Mr. Callendar would have dinner with us and tell us a\nlittle more, we'd be better able to help.\"\n\n\"Not a bad idea, Carol. We should know a little more.\"\n\nCarol selected a dinner and pressed the button that would start its\npreparation.\n\nHer father said casually, \"You are a stranger to Ganymede, aren't you,\nMr. Callendar?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure of that,\" said the man.\n\nHer father's eyebrows went up.\n\nCarol said, \"But you do come from one of Jupiter's moons?\"\n\n\"I can't remember which one. There are a lot of things that my memory's\nhazy about. I can't even recall the name of the company I worked for as\nan engineer.\"\n\n\"That may not be so strange. I find difficulty remembering the school\nwhere I taught on Earth. P.S. 654, wasn't it, Dad?\"\n\n\"P.S. 634,\" Mr. Marsh corrected briefly.\n\n\"You see?\" she said. \"Do you remember your wife's name? And the names\nof your children?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't forget _them_,\" he said. \"My wife's name was Mona.\" He\nstared at the wall for a moment, his face without expression. \"I can\nstill see the way she looked when I left to undergo treatment. Paul\nwas--let's see, he must be about nine, maybe ten, by this time. And\nWilma must be six or seven. I remember how scared she was that time she\nfound a harmless little phytopod. She thought it was going to bite her.\"\n\n\"Phytopod?\" said Carol. \"We don't have them around here. What do they\nlook like?\"\n\n\"They're small and furry, and have two feet that look like roots. When\nthey stand still you're likely to mistake them for plants.\"\n\n\"You _do_ recall some things,\" said Carol.\n\n\"The little things that don't tell me where to look. I remember the\ntime we went on a picnic--I don't recall how many moons there were in\nthe sky--and the ground began to shake. It didn't do any damage, but\nWilma was terrified. Paul took it in his stride, though.\"\n\n\"There aren't any earthquakes on Ganymede,\" said her father. \"If your\nmemory of that incident is correct, you're looking in the wrong place.\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" he said. \"But what's the right place?\"\n\n\"Perhaps if you thought of a few more incidents, we might figure it\nout. It's the little things you don't forget that can be most helpful.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhat nonsense, thought Carol, although she kept the thought to herself.\nThe little things can be most _harmful_. They keep the pain, and the\nmemory of pain, alive and vivid. She remembered little things about\nJohn all too well--the careless way he wore his clothes, and the way he\ncombed his hair, the cigarettes he smoked, and the foods he liked to\neat. And the stupid way she had let herself fall in love with him.\n\nShe hadn't even had the excuse of its happening suddenly, as it had\nhappened now. She had begun to love John as she had come to know him,\ndisregarding all the evidence of his selfishness, of his genuine\ninability to care for any one else than John Burr.\n\nUnaware of what was going on in her mind, Callendar was saying, with\nsomewhat more animation than he had previously shown, \"I think you're\nright, Mr. Marsh. I've kept my troubles too much to myself. Maybe you\ncan't actually do anything for me, but it wouldn't hurt me to talk. I\nshould have done my talking long ago. When they found me.\"\n\n\"Where did they find you?\" asked her father. \"And what did you mean\nbefore, when you said you're not sure of anything?\"\n\n\"They picked me up in a lifeboat, drifting some place between Mars and\nJupiter. The motor was off, but the power pile was working, and the\nair-purifying equipment was on. I was apparently hibernating. I might\nhave been that way for six months or a year.\"\n\n\"And you don't remember--\" said Carol.\n\n\"There's plenty I don't remember, but as I've said, my memory isn't a\ncomplete blank. My wife and I and the kids had settled down in a new\ncolony--exactly where it was is one of the things I forget. I believe\nnow that it wasn't Ganymede. Maybe it was some other moon of Jupiter's.\n\n\"Anyway, I seem to recall having some trouble with my health, and being\ntaken onto an inter-planetary hospital ship for treatment--L-treatment,\nthey called it. That's where they put me to sleep. What happened after\nthat, I can only guess. The ship must have been involved in some\naccident. I must have been transferred to the lifeboat.\"\n\n\"Alone?\" asked Carol's father.\n\n\"No. There were two other patients with me. They were found dead. I was\nthe only one left alive. The bodies of the crew members who transferred\nus weren't found at all. They might have gone back for more patients\nand then been unable to get away again.\"\n\n\"Who found your lifeboat?\"\n\n\"The crew of a freighter, who spotted it drifting across a space lane.\nThey took me on board and revived me. But they were in a hurry and\ndidn't have much time to stay and investigate.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMr. Marsh was thoughtful and silent.\n\nCarol asked, \"Weren't there any records in the lifeboat?\"\n\n\"Nobody thought of that, at least not in the beginning. At first, when\nI regained consciousness, my mind was almost a complete blank. Then I\nbegan to remember things, but not enough. I couldn't recall where the\ncolony had been, and after I had recovered enough to be able to get\naround, I began looking for my wife and children. I haven't come across\na trace of them, although I've been on many worlds.\"\n\nThe food had long been ready and waiting. Until now, no one had thought\nof getting it. He stared as if through the wall and Carol, after she\nhad set the dishes before him, had to remind him of their presence.\nWhen he did eat, it was automatically, without enjoyment.\n\nAfterward, her father surprised Carol by saying, \"Why not stay with us\novernight, Mr. Callendar? We have an extra room, and tomorrow I may be\nable to give you a little helpful information.\"\n\nThe man's eyes came alive. \"You're serious? You think that from what I\ntold you, you'll be able to guess where I came from?\"\n\n\"I used the word 'might.' Don't get your hopes up too much.\"\n\nHis face fell again. \"Thanks for warning me,\" he said in a flat tone.\n\nWhen, later on, he had gone to his room, Carol said, \"Dad, do you\nreally think you can help him?\"\n\n\"That depends on your idea of help. Why are you so interested in him?\nPerhaps you're falling in love with him, Carol?\"\n\n\"I think so.\"\n\n\"Under the circumstances, that's completely idiotic. Would there be any\nsense in asking _why_ you fell in love with him?\"\n\n\"Well, he looked so _lost_! I guess it's maternal--\"\n\n\"As genuine a case of the grand passion as I've ever encountered,\" he\nsaid drily. \"Almost as genuine as your previous experience.\"\n\nCarol flushed. \"He isn't like John.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Fortunately, you are right. Burr was essentially a selfish baby. I\ncan't imagine him spending _his_ life looking for a wife and children\nhe had lost. In future, Carol, if you must fall in love at all, do it\nsuddenly. You choose much better that way.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" she said. \"Except for the fact that the wife and\nchildren may interfere. But don't worry, Dad. This time I'm not\nquitting my job and moving several million miles away to try to forget.\"\n\n\"There'll be no need for that.\" His face took on a troubled expression.\n\"You'll have to face your problem right here.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You haven't answered _my_ question,\" said Carol. \"Do you really think\nyou can help him?\"\n\n\"That isn't an easy one to answer. We'll have to prepare him for a\nshock, Carol. A first-class shock. That's why I wanted to be sure you\nwere in love with him. It may make things easier for him to stand.\"\n\n\"What things?\"\n\nHer father hesitated. \"Have you ever heard of this L-treatment he\nmentioned?\"\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n\"I thought not. Carol,\" he said, and his voice was unexpectedly full\nof compassion, \"you're going to have a very sick man on your hands. It\nwon't be pleasant for either you or me, and it's going to be horrible\nfor him. But it must be gone through. He must be told.\"\n\n\"For heaven's sake, what is it?\"\n\n\"The L in L-treatment,\" he said slowly, \"stands for longevity. That\nwas what he was treated for. But you see now why it was found to be\ndangerous and discontinued. The reason you never heard of it is that\nit was developed and discarded two hundred years ago. Callendar wasn't\nadrift in space for a year or two, as he thinks. He was adrift for two\ncenturies.\"\n\n\"No! Oh, _no_!\"\n\n\"That's why the clothes in those pictures seemed odd. They've been in\nstyle and out again half a dozen times, with slight changes each time.\nThat is why, furthermore, he can't find his wife and children on any of\nJupiter's moons. The moons were first colonized ninety years ago.\"\n\n\"But he says--\"\n\n\"He'll never see his wife and children again. They've lived their lives\nand died and been buried in the past. He should have died with them in\nhis own time and not lived into ours.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Carol, \"or I'd never have known him.\"\n\nShe was white and trembling, and her father pulled her to him and let\nher head rest on his shoulder.\n\nMr. Marsh said, \"Perhaps you're right. I don't know. Anyway, he'll have\nto be told. And for your sake, I'd better do the telling.\"\n\nCarol was silent, and they both thought of the sleeping man who didn't\nknow that his old life had ended and that a new life was to begin so\npainfully in the morning.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Spoken For, by William Morrison\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK SPOKEN FOR ***\n\n***** This file should be named 51121.txt or 51121.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/1/1/2/51121/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\nwww.gutenberg.org\n\n\n\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
