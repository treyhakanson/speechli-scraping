A\nghost! It's all white an' shinin'!\"\n\n\"Nonsense, Willie,\" Don turned to me. \"I say, Bob, what do you make\nof this?\"\n\n\"I seen it, I tell you,\" the boy broke in. \"It ain't a mile from\nhere if you want to go look at it.\"\n\nDon gripped the colored boy whose coffee complexion had taken on a\ngreenish cast with his terror.\n\n[Illustration: _I fired at an oncoming white figure._]\n\n\"Stop saying that, Willie. That's absolute rot. There's no such\nthing as a ghost.\"\n\n\"But I seen--\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Over on the north shore. Not far.\"\n\n\"What did you see?\" Don shook him. \"Tell us exactly.\"\n\n\"A man! I seen a man. He was up on a cliff just by the golf course\nwhen I first seen him. I was comin' along the path down by the Fort\nBeach an' I looked up an' there he was, shinin' all white in the\nmoonlight. An' then before I could run, he came floatin' down at\nme.\"\n\n\"Floating?\"\n\n\"Yes. He didn't walk. He came down through the rocks. I could see\nthe rocks of the cliff right through him.\"\n\nDon laughed at that. But neither he nor I could set this down as\nutter nonsense, for within the past week there had been many wild\nstories of ghosts among the colored people of Bermuda. The Negroes\nof Bermuda are not unduly superstitious, and certainly they are more\nintelligent, better educated than most of their race. But the little\nislands, this past week, were echoing with whispered tales of\nstrange things seen at night. It had been mostly down at the lower\nend of the comparatively inaccessible Somerset; but now here it was\nin our own neighborhood.\n\n\"You've got the fever, Willie,\" Don laughed. \"I say, who told you\nyou saw a man walking through rock?\"\n\n\"Nobody told me. I seen him. It ain't far if you--\"\n\n\"You think he's still there?\"\n\n\"Maybe so. Mr. Don, he was standin' still, with his arms folded. I\nran, an'--\"\n\n\"Let's go see if he's there,\" I suggested. \"I'd like to have a look\nat one of these ghosts.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut even as I lightly said it, a queer thrill of fear shot through\nme. No one can contemplate an encounter with the supernatural\nwithout a shudder.\n\n\"Right you are,\" Don exclaimed. \"What's the use of theory? Can you\nlead us to where you saw him, Willie?\"\n\n\"Ye-es, of course.\"\n\nThe sixteen-year-old Willie was shaking again. \"W-what's that for,\nMr. Don?\"\n\nDon had picked up a shotgun which was standing in a corner of the\nroom.\n\n\"Ain't no--no use of that, Mr. Don.\"\n\n\"We'll take it anyway, Willie. Ready, Bob?\"\n\nA step sounded behind us. \"Where are you going?\"\n\nIt was Jane Dorrance, Don's cousin. She stood in the doorway. Her\nlong, filmy white summer dress fell nearly to her ankles. Her black\nhair was coiled on her head. In her bodice was a single red\npoinsettia blossom. As she stood motionless, her small slight figure\nframed against the dark background of the hall, she could have been\na painting of an English beauty save for the black hair suggesting\nthe tropics. Her blue-eyed gaze went from Don to me, and then to the\ngun.\n\n\"Where are you going?\"\n\n\"Willie saw a ghost.\" Don grinned. \"They've come from Somerset,\nJane. I say, one of them seems to be right here.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Willie saw it down by the Fort Beach.\"\n\n\"To-night?\"\n\n\"Yes. Just now. So he says, though it's all rot, of course.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Jane, and she became silent.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe appeared to be barring our way. It seemed to me, too, that the\ncolor had left her face, and I wondered vaguely why she was taking\nit so seriously. That was not like Jane: she was a level-headed\ngirl, not at all the sort to be frightened by Negroes talking of\nghosts.\n\nShe turned suddenly on Willie. The colored boy had been employed in\nthe Dorrance household since childhood. Jane herself was only\nseventeen, and she had known Willie here in this same big white\nstone house, almost from infancy.\n\n\"Willie, what you saw, was it a--a man?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the boy eagerly. \"A man. A great big man. All white an'\nshinin'.\"\n\n\"A man with a hood? Or a helmet? Something like a queer-looking hat\non his head, Willie?\"\n\n\"Jane!\" expostulated Don. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I saw him--saw it,\" said Jane nervously.\n\n\"Good Lord!\" I exclaimed. \"You did? When? Why didn't you tell us?\"\n\n\"I saw it last night.\" She smiled faintly. \"I didn't want to add to\nthese wild tales. I thought it was my imagination. I had been\nasleep--I fancy I was dreaming of ghosts anyway.\"\n\n\"You saw it--\" Don prompted.\n\n\"Outside my bedroom window. Some time in the middle of the night.\nThe moon was out and the--the man was all white and shining, just as\nWillie says.\"\n\n\"But your bedroom,\" I protested. \"Good Lord, your bedroom is on the\nupper floor.\"\n\nBut Jane continued soberly, with a sudden queer hush to her voice,\n\"It was standing in the air outside my window. I think it had been\nlooking in. When I sat up--I think I had cried out, though none of\nyou heard me evidently--when I sat up, it moved away; walked away.\nWhen I got to the window, there was nothing to see.\" She smiled\nagain. \"I decided it was all part of my dream. This morning--well, I\nwas afraid to tell you because I knew you'd laugh at me. So many\ngirls down in Somerset have been imagining things like that.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTo me, this was certainly a new light on the matter. I think that\nboth Don and I, and certainly the police, had vaguely been of the\nopinion that some very human trickster was at the bottom of all\nthis. Someone, criminal or otherwise, against whom our shotgun would\nbe efficacious. But here was level-headed Jane telling us of a man\nstanding in mid-air peering into her second-floor bedroom, and then\nwalking away. No trickster could accomplish that.\n\n\"Ain't we goin'?\" Willie demanded. \"I seen it, but it'll be gone.\"\n\n\"Right enough,\" Don exclaimed grimly. \"Come on, Willie.\"\n\nHe disregarded Jane as he walked to the door, but she clung to him.\n\n\"I'm coming,\" she said obstinately, and snatched a white lace scarf\nfrom the hall rack and flung it over her head like a mantilla. \"Don,\nmay I come?\" she added coaxingly.\n\nHe gazed at me dubiously. \"Why, I suppose so,\" he said finally. Then\nhe grinned. \"Certainly no harm is going to come to us from a ghost.\nMight frighten us to death, but that's about all a ghost can do,\nisn't it?\"\n\nWe left the house. The only other member of the Dorrance household\nwas Jane's father--the Hon. Arthur Dorrance, M.P. He had been in\nHamilton all day, and had not yet returned. It was about nine\no'clock of an evening in mid-May. The huge moon rode high in a\nfleecy sky, illumining the island with a light so bright one could\nalmost read by it.\n\n\"We'll walk,\" said Don. \"No use riding, Willie.\"\n\n\"No. It's shorter over the hill. It ain't far.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe left our bicycles standing against the front veranda, and, with\nWillie and Don leading us, we plunged off along the little dirt road\nof the Dorrance estate. The poinsettia blooms were thick on both\nsides of us. A lily field, which a month before had been solid white\nwith blossoms, still added its redolence to the perfumed night air.\nThrough the branches of the squat cedar trees, in almost every\ndirection there was water visible--deep purple this night, with a\nrippled sheen of silver upon it.\n\nWe reached the main road, a twisting white ribbon in the moonlight.\nWe followed it for a little distance, around a corkscrew turn,\nacross a tiny causeway where the moonlit water of an inlet lapped\nagainst the base of the road and the sea-breeze fanned us. A\ncarriage, heading into the nearby town of St. Georges, passed us\nwith the thud of horses' hoofs pounding on the hard smooth stone of\nthe road. Under its jaunty canopy an American man reclined with a\ngirl on each side of him. He waved us a jovial greeting as they\npassed.\n\nThen Willie turned us off the road. We climbed the ramp of an open\ngrassy field, with a little cedar woods to one side, and up ahead,\nhalf a mile to the right, the dark crumbling ramparts of a little\nancient fort which once was for the defense of the island.\n\nJane and I were together, with Willie and Don in advance of us, and\nDon carrying the shotgun.\n\n\"You really saw it, Jane?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know. I thought I did. Then I thought that I didn't.\"\n\n\"Well, I hope we see it now. And if it's human--which it must be if\nthere's anything to it at all--we'll march it back to St. Georges\nand lock it up.\"\n\nShe turned and smiled at me, but it was a queer smile, and I must\nadmit my own feelings were queer.\n\n\"Don't you think you're talking nonsense, Bob?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do,\" I admitted. \"I guess maybe the whole thing is nonsense.\nBut it's got the police quite worried. You knew that, didn't you?\nAll this wild talk--there must be some basis for it.\"\n\nDon was saying, \"Take the lower path, Willie. Take the same route\nyou were taking when you saw it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe climbed down a steep declivity, shadowed by cedar trees, and\nreached the edge of a tiny, almost landlocked, lagoon. It was no\nmore than a few hundred feet in diameter. The jagged, porous\ngray-black rocks rose like an upstanding crater rim to mark its\nten-foot entrance to the sea. A little white house stood here with\nits back against the fifty-foot cliff. It was dark, its colored\noccupants probably already asleep. Two rowboats floated in the\nlagoon, moored near the shore. And on the narrow strip of stony\nbeach, nets were spread to dry.\n\n\"This way, Mister Don. I was comin' along here, toward the Fort.\"\nWillie was again shaking with excitement. \"Just past that bend.\"\n\n\"You keep behind me.\" Don led us now, with his gun half raised.\n\"Don't talk when we get further along, and walk as quietly as you\ncan.\"\n\nThe narrow path followed the bottom of the cliff. We presently had\nthe open sea before us, with a line of reefs a few hundred yards out\nagainst which the lazy ground swell was breaking in a line of white.\nThe moonlit water lapped gently at our feet. The cliff rose to our\nright, a mass of gray-black rock, pitted and broken, fantastically\nindented, unreal in the moonlight.\n\n\"I seen it--just about there,\" Willie whispered.\n\nBefore us, a little rock headland jutted out into the water. Don\nhalted us, and we stood silent, gazing. I think that there is hardly\nany place more fantastic than a Bermuda shorefront in the moonlight.\nIn these little eroded recesses, caves and grottoes one might expect\nto see crooked-legged gnomes, scampering to peer at the human\nintruder. Gnarled cedars, hanging precariously, might hide pixies\nand elves. A child's dream of fairyland, this reality of a Bermuda\nshorefront.\n\n\"There it is!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWillie's sibilant whisper dispelled my roaming fancy. We all turned\nto stare behind us in the direction of Willie's unsteady finger. And\nwe all saw it--the white shape of a man down near the winding path\nwe had just traversed. A wild thrill of fear, excitement,\nrevulsion--call it what you will--surged over me. The thing had been\nfollowing us!\n\nWe stood frozen, transfixed. The shape was almost at the water\nlevel, a hundred feet or so away. It had stopped its advance; to all\nappearances it was a man standing there, calmly regarding us. Don\nand I swung around to face it, shoving Jane and Willie behind us.\n\nWillie had started off in terror, but Jane gripped him.\n\n\"Quiet, Willie!\"\n\n\"There it is! See it--\"\n\n\"Of course we see it,\" Don whispered. \"Don't talk. We'll wait; see\nwhat it does.\"\n\nWe stood a moment. The thing was motionless. It was in a patch of\nshadow, but, as though gleaming with moonlight, it seemed to shine.\nIts glow was silvery, with a greenish cast almost phosphorescent.\nWas it standing on the path? I could not tell. It was too far away;\ntoo much in shadow. But I plainly saw that it had the shape of a\nman. Wraith, or substance? That also, was not yet apparent.\n\nThen suddenly it was moving! Coming toward us. But not floating, for\nI could see the legs moving, the arms swaying. With measured tread\nit was walking slowly toward us!\n\nDon's shotgun went up. \"Bob, we'll hold our ground. Is it--is he\narmed, can you see?\"\n\n\"No! Can't tell.\"\n\nArmed! What nonsense! How could this wraith, this apparition, do us\nphysical injury!\n\n\"If--if he gets too close, Bob, by God, I'll shoot. But if he's\nhuman, I wouldn't want to kill him.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe shape had stopped again. It was fifty feet from us now, and we\ncould clearly see that it was a man, taller than normal. He stood\nnow with folded arms--a man strangely garbed in what seemed a white,\ntight-fitting jacket and short trunks. On his head was a black skull\ncap surmounted by a helmet of strange design.\n\nDon's voice suddenly echoed across the rocks.\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\nThe white figure gave no answer. It did not move.\n\n\"We see you. What do you want?\" Don repeated.\n\nThen it moved again. Partly toward us and partly sidewise, away from\nthe sea. The swing of the legs was obvious. It was walking. But not\nupon the path, nor upon the solid surface of these Bermuda rocks! A\nsurge of horror went through me at the realization. This was nothing\nhuman! It was walking on some other surface, invisible to us, but\nsomething solid beneath its own tread.\n\n\"Look!\" Jane whispered. \"It's walking--_into the cliff_!\"\n\nThere was no doubt about it now. Within thirty feet of us, it was\nslowly walking up what must have been a steep ascent. Already it was\nten feet or more above our level. And it was behind the rocks of the\ncliff! Shining in there as though the rocks themselves were\ntransparent!\n\nOr were my senses tricking me? I whispered, \"Is it back of the\nrocks? Or is there a cave over there? An opening?\"\n\n\"Let's go see.\" Don took a step forward; and called again:\n\n\"You--we see you. Stand still! Do you want me to fire at you?\"\n\nThe figure turned and again stood regarding us with folded arms.\nObviously not Don's voice, but his movement, had stopped it. We left\nthe path and climbed about ten feet up the broken cliff-side. The\nfigure was at our level now, but it was within the rocks. We were\nclose enough now to see other details: a man's white face, with\nheavy black brows, heavy features; a stalwart, giant figure, six and\na half feet at the least. The white garment could have been of woven\nmetal. I saw black, thread-like wires looped along the arms, over\nthe shoulders, down the sides of the muscular naked legs. There\nseemed, at the waist, a dial-face, with wires running into it.\n\nThe details were so clear that they seemed substantial, real. Yet\nthe figure was so devoid of color that it could have been a\nlight-image projected here upon these rocks. And the contour of the\ncliff was plainly visible in front of it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe stood gazing at the thing, and it stared back at us.\n\n\"Can you hear us?\" Don called.\n\nEvidently it could not. Then a sardonic smile spread over the face\nof the apparition. The lips moved. It said something to us, but we\nheard no sound.\n\nIt was a wraith--this thing so visibly real! It was apparently close\nto us, yet there was a limitless, intervening void of the unknown.\n\nIt stood still with folded arms across the brawny chest,\nsardonically regarding us. The face was strangely featured, yet\nwholly of human cast. And, above all, its aspect was strangely evil.\nIts gaze suddenly turned on Jane with a look that made my heart leap\ninto my throat and made me fling up my arms as though to protect\nher.\n\nThen seemingly it had contemplated us enough; the folded arms swung\ndown; it turned away from us, slowly stalking off.\n\n\"Stop!\" Don called.\n\n\"See!\" I whispered. \"It's coming out in the open!\"\n\nThe invisible surface upon which it walked led it out from the\ncliff. The figure was stalking away from us in mid-air, and it\nseemed to fade slowly in the moonlight.\n\n\"It's going!\" I exclaimed. \"Don, it's getting away!\"\n\nImpulsively I started scrambling over the rocks; unreasoningly, for\nwho can chase and capture a ghost?\n\nDon stopped me. \"Wait!\" His shotgun went to his shoulders. The white\nshape was now again about fifty feet away. The gun blazed into the\nmoonlight. The buckshot tore through the stalking white figure; the\nmoonlit shorefront echoed with the shot.\n\nWhen the smoke cleared away, we saw the apparition still walking\nquietly forward. Up over the sea now, up and out into the moonlit\nnight, growing smaller and dimmer in the distance, until presently\nit was faded and gone.\n\nA ghost?\n\nWe thought so then.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n_The Face at the Window_\n\n\nThis was our first encounter with the white invaders. It was too\nreal to ignore or treat lightly. One may hear tales of a ghost, even\nthe recounting by a most reliable eye-witness, and smile\nskeptically. But to see one yourself--as we had seen this thing in\nthe moonlight of that Bermuda shorefront--that is a far different\nmatter.\n\nWe told our adventure to Jane's father when he drove in from\nHamilton about eleven o'clock that same evening. But he, who\npersonally had seen no ghost, could only look perturbed that we\nshould be so deluded. Some trickster--or some trick of the\nmoonlight, and the shadowed rocks aiding our own sharpened\nimaginations. He could think of no other explanation. But Don had\nfired pointblank into the thing and had not harmed it.\n\nArthur Dorrance, member of the Bermuda Parliament, was a gray-haired\ngentleman in his fifties, a typical British Colonial, the present\nhead of this old Bermuda family. The tales or the ghosts, whatever\ntheir origin, already had forced themselves upon Governmental\nattention. All this evening, in Hamilton, Mr. Dorrance had been in\nconference trying to determine what to do about it. Tales of terror\nin little Bermuda had a bad enough local effect, but to have them\nspread abroad, to influence adversely the tourist trade upon which\nBermuda's very existence depended--that presaged economic\ncatastrophe.\n\n\"And the tales are spreading,\" he told us. \"Look here, you young\ncubs, it's horribly disconcerting to have you of all people telling\nme a thing like this.\"\n\nEven now he could not believe us. But he sat staring at us,\neyeglasses in hand, with his untouched drink before him.\n\n\"We'll have to report it, of course. I've been all evening with the\nsteamship officials. They're having cancellations.\" He smiled\nfaintly at me. \"We can't get along without you Americans, Bob.\"\n\nI have not mentioned that I am an American. I was on vacation from\nmy job as radio technician in New York. Don Livingston, who is\nEnglish and three years my senior, was in a similar line of work--at\nthis time he was technician in the small Bermuda broadcasting\nstation located in the nearby town of St. Georges.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe talked until nearly midnight. Then the telephone rang. It was the\nPolice Chief in Hamilton. Ghosts had been seen in that vicinity this\nevening. There were a dozen complaints of ghostly marauders prowling\naround homes. This time from both white and colored families.\n\nAnd there was one outstanding fact, frightening, indeed, though at\nfirst we could not believe that it meant very much, or that it had\nany connection with this weird affair. In the residential suburb of\nPaget, across the harbor from Hamilton, a young white girl, named\nMiss Arton, had vanished. Mr. Dorrance turned from the telephone\nafter listening to the details and faced us with white face and\ntrembling hands, his expression more perturbed and solemn than ever\nbefore.\n\n\"It means nothing, of course. It cannot mean anything.\"\n\n\"What, father?\" Jane demanded. \"Something about Eunice?\"\n\n\"Yes. You know her, Bob--you played tennis down there with her last\nweek. Eunice Arton.\"\n\nI remembered her. A Bermuda girl; a beauty, second to none in the\nislands, save perhaps Jane herself. Jane and Don had known her for\nyears.\n\n\"She's missing,\" Mr. Dorrance added. He flashed us a queer look and\nwe stared at him blankly. \"It means nothing, of course,\" he added.\n\"She's been gone only an hour.\"\n\nBut we all knew that it did mean something. For myself I recall a\nchill of inward horror; a revulsion as though around me were\npressing unknown things; unseeable, imponderable things menacing us\nall.\n\n\"Eunice missing! But father, how missing?\"\n\nHe put his arm around Jane. \"Don't look so frightened, my dear\nchild.\"\n\nHe held her against him. If only all of us could have anticipated\nthe events of the next few days. If only we could have held Jane,\nguarded her, as her father was affectionately holding her now!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDon exclaimed, \"But the Chief of Police gave you details?\"\n\n\"There weren't many to give.\" He lighted a cigarette and smiled at\nhis trembling hands. \"I don't know why I should feel this way, but I\ndo. I suppose--well, it's what you have told me to-night. I don't\nunderstand it--I can't think it was all your imagination.\"\n\n\"But that girl, Eunice,\" I protested.\n\n\"Nothing--except she isn't at home where she should be. At eleven\no'clock she told her parents she was going to retire. Presumably she\nwent to her room. At eleven-thirty her mother passed her door. It\nwas ajar and a bedroom light was lighted. Mrs. Arton opened the door\nto say good night to Eunice. But the girl was not there.\"\n\nHe stared at us. \"That's all. There is so much hysteria in the air\nnow, that Mr. Arton was frightened and called upon the police at\nonce. The Artons have been telephoning to everyone they know. It\nisn't like Eunice to slip out at night--or is it, Jane?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Jane soberly. \"And she's gone? They didn't hear any sound\nfrom her?\" A strange, frightened hush came upon Jane's voice. \"She\ndidn't--scream from her bedroom? Anything like that?\"\n\n\"No, he said not. Jane, dear, you're thinking more horrible things.\nShe'll be found in the morning, visiting some neighbor or something\nof the kind.\"\n\nBut she was not found. Bermuda is a small place. The islands are so\nnarrow that the ocean on both sides is visible from almost\neverywhere. It is only some twelve miles from St. Georges to\nHamilton, and another twelve miles puts one in remote Somerset. By\nnoon of the next day it was obvious that Eunice Arton was quite\ndefinitely missing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis next day was May 15th--the first of the real terror brought by\nthe White Invaders. But we did not call them that yet; they were\nstill the \"ghosts.\" Bermuda was seething with terror. Every police\nstation was deluged with reports of the ghostly apparitions. The\nwhite figures of men--in many instances, several figures\ntogether--had been seen during the night in every part of the\nislands. A little band of wraiths had marched down the deserted main\nstreet of Hamilton. It was nearly dawn. A few colored men, three or\nfour roistering visitors, and two policemen had seen them. They had\nappeared down at the docks and had marched up the slope of the main\nstreet.\n\nThe stories of eye-witnesses to any strange event always are\ncontradictory. Some said this band of ghostly men marched on the\nstreet level; others said they were below it, walking with only\ntheir heads above the road surface and gradually descending. In any\nevent the frightened group of onlookers scattered and shouted until\nthe whole little street was aroused. But by then the ghosts had\nvanished.\n\nThere were tales of prowlers around houses. Dogs barked in the\nnight, frantic with excitement, and then shivered with terror,\nfearful of what they could sense but not see.\n\nIn Hamilton harbor, moored at its dock, was a liner ready to leave\nfor New York. The deck watch saw ghosts walking apparently in\nmid-air over the moonlit bay, and claimed that he saw the white\nfigure of a man pass through the solid hull-plates of the ship. At\nthe Gibbs Hill Lighthouse other apparitions were seen; and the St.\nDavid Islanders saw a group of distant figures seemingly a hundred\nfeet or more beneath the beach--a group, heedless of being observed;\nbusy with some activity; dragging some apparatus, it seemed. They\npulled and tugged at it, moving it along with them until they were\nlost to sight, faded in the arriving dawn and blurred by the white\nline of breakers on the beach over them.\n\nThe tales differed materially in details. But nearly all mentioned\nthe dark helmets of strange design, the white, tightly fitting\ngarments, and many described the dark thread-like wires looped along\nthe arms and legs, running up into the helmet, and back across the\nchest to converge at the belt where there was a clock-like\ndial-face.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe ghostly visitors seemed not aggressive. But Eunice Arton was\nmissing; and by noon of May 15th it was apparent that several other\nwhite girls had also vanished. All of them were under twenty, all of\nprominent Bermuda families, and all of exceptional beauty.\n\nBy this time the little government was in chaos. The newspapers, by\ngovernment order, were suppressed. The cable station voluntarily\nrefused to send press dispatches to the outside world. Don, Jane and\nI, through Mr. Dorrance's prominence, had all the reports; but to\nthe public it was only known by whispered, garbled rumor. A panic\nwas impending. The New York liner, that morning of May 15th, was\nbooked beyond capacity. An English ship, anchored out in the open\nchannel outside Hamilton harbor, received passengers up to its limit\nand sailed.\n\nThe shops of St. Georges and Hamilton did not open that morning of\nMay 15th. People gathered in the streets--groups of whites and\nblacks--trying to learn what they could, and each adding his own\nreal or fancied narrative to the chaos.\n\nAlthough there had seemed so far no aggression from the ghosts--our\nown encounter with the apparition being typical of them all--shortly\nafter noon of the 15th we learned of an event which changed the\nwhole aspect of the affair; an event sinister beyond any which had\ngone before. It had occurred in one of the hotels near Hamilton the\nprevious night and had been suppressed until now.\n\nA young woman tourist, living alone in the hotel, had occupied a\nbedroom on the lower floor. The storm blinds and windows were open.\nDuring the night she had screamed. Guests in nearby rooms heard her\ncries, and they were also conscious of a turmoil in the woman's\nroom. Her door was locked on the inside, and when the night clerk\nfinally arrived with a pass-key and they entered, they found the\nroom disordered, a wicker chair and table overturned, and the young\nwoman gone, presumably out of the window. She had been a woman of\nabout twenty-five, a widow, exceptionally attractive.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nStolen by the ghosts? We could think of nothing else. Was that what\nhad happened to Eunice Arton? Did that explain the reported\ndisappearances of the several other girls? Did this ghostly activity\nhave some rational purpose--the stealing of young white women, all\nof them of unusual beauty? The conclusion was forced upon us, and\nwith it the whole affair took on a complexion shudderingly sinister.\nIt was not a mere panic of the people with which Bermuda now had to\ncope--not merely an unexplainable supernatural visitation, harmless\nenough, save that it was terrorizing. This was a menace. Something\nwhich had to be met with action.\n\nIt would be futile for me to attempt detailing the events of that\nchaotic day. We had all ridden over to Hamilton and spent the day\nthere, with the little town in a turmoil and events seething around\nus--a seemingly endless stream of reports of what had happened the\nnight before. By daylight no apparitions were seen. But another\nnight was coming. I recall with an inward sinking of heart I saw the\nafternoon sun lowering, the sky-blue waters of the bay deepening\ninto purple and the chalk-white little stone houses taking on the\ngray cast of twilight. Another night was coming.\n\nThe government was making the best preparations it could. Every\npoliceman of the island force was armed and ready to patrol through\nthe night. The few soldiers of the garrisons at St. Georges and\nHamilton were armed and ready. The police with bicycles were ready\nto ride all the roads. The half dozen garbage trucks--low-geared\nmotor trucks--were given over to the soldiers for patrol use. The\nonly other automobiles on the islands were those few permitted for\nthe use of the physicians, and there were a few ambulance cars. All\nof these were turned over to the troops and the police for patrol.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the late afternoon an American newspaper hydroplane arrived from\nNew York. It landed in the waters of Hamilton harbor and prepared to\nencircle the islands throughout the night. And the three or four\nsteamship tenders and the little duty boat which supplied the\ngovernment dockyards with daily provisions all had steam up, ready\nto patrol the island waters.\n\nYet it all seemed so futile against this unknown enemy. Ghosts? We\ncould hardly think of them now as that. Throughout the chaotic day I\nrecall so many wild things I had heard others say, and had myself\nthought. The dead come to life as living wraiths? A ghost could not\nmaterialize and kidnap a girl of flesh and blood. Or could it?\nHysterical speculation! Or were these invaders from another planet?\n\nWhatever their nature, they were enemies. That much we knew.\n\nNight fell upon the crowded turmoil of the little city of Hamilton.\nThe streets were thronged with excited, frightened people. The\npublic park was jammed. The hotels and the restaurants were crowded.\nGroups of soldiers and police on bicycles with electric torches\nfastened to their handlebars were passing at intervals. Overhead the\nairplane, flying low, roared past every twenty minutes or so.\n\nThe night promised to be clear. The moon would rise, just beyond the\nfull, a few hours after sunset. It was a warm and breathless night,\nwith less wind than usual. Most of the people crowding the streets\nand the restaurants were in white linen--themselves suggesting the\nwhite and ghostly enemy.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMr. Dorrance was occupied at the Government House. Jane, Don and I\nhad supper in a restaurant on Queen Street. It was nearly eight\no'clock and the crowd in the restaurant was thinning out. We were\nseated near the street entrance where large plate-glass windows\ndisplayed a variety of bakery products and confections. Jane had her\nback to the street, but Don and I were facing it. Crowds were\nconstantly passing. It was near the end of our meal. I was gazing\nidly through one of the windows, watching the passing people when\nsuddenly I became aware of a man standing out there gazing in at me.\nI think I have never had so startling a realization. It was a man in\nwhite doeskin trousers and blue blazer jacket, with a jaunty linen\ncap on his head. An abnormally tall, muscular man. And his\nsmooth-shaven, black-browed face with the reflection from the\nrestaurant window lights upon it, reminded me of the apparition we\nhad seen the night before!\n\n\"Don! Don't look up! Don't move! Jane, don't look around!\" I\nwhispered, almost frantically.\n\nI must have gone white for Don and Jane gaped at me in astonishment.\n\n\"Don't do that!\" I murmured. \"Someone outside, watching us!\" I tried\nto smile. \"Hot night, isn't it? Did you get a check, Don?\" I looked\naround vaguely for the waitress, but out of the tail of my eyes I\ncould see the fellow out there still peering in and staring intently\nat us.\n\n\"What is it?\" Don whispered.\n\n\"Man watching us! See him out there--the right-hand window! Jane,\ndon't look around!\"\n\n\"Good Lord!\" murmured Don.\n\n\"Looks like him, doesn't it?\"\n\n\"Good Lord! But I say--\"\n\n\"What is it?\" murmured Jane. \"What is it?\"\n\n\"Waitress!\" I called. \"Check, please. There's a man out there,\nJane--we're crazy, but he does look like that ghost we saw on the\nFort Beach.\"\n\nIf the fellow knew that we had spotted him he gave no sign. He was\nstill apparently regarding the bakery display in the window, but\nwatching us nevertheless. I was sure of that.\n\nThe waitress gave us our check. \"Nine and six,\" Don smiled. \"Thank\nyou. But didn't you forget that last coffee?\"\n\nThe colored girl added the extra sixpence, and left us.\n\n\"You think that's the same--I say, good Lord--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDon was speechless. Jane had gone white. The fellow moved to the\nother window, and Jane had a swift look at him. We all recognized\nhim, or thought we did. What necromancy was this? Had one of the\napparitions materialized? Was that ghost we saw, this gigantic\nfellow in doeskins and blazer who looked like a tourist standing out\nthere at the window? Were these ghosts merely human enemies after\nall?\n\nThe idea was at once terrifying, and yet reassuring. This was a man\nwith whom we could cope with normal tactics. My hand went to the\npocket of my blazer where I had a little revolver. Both Don and I\nwere armed--permits for the carrying of concealed weapons had been\nissued to us this same day.\n\nI murmured, \"Jane! There are the Blakinsons over there. Go join\nthem. We'll be back presently.\"\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" Don demanded.\n\n\"Go out and tackle him--shall we? Have a talk. Find out who he is.\"\n\n\"No!\" Jane protested.\n\n\"Why not? Don't you worry, Jane. Right here in the public\nstreet--and we're both armed. He's only a man.\"\n\nBut was he only a man?\n\n\"We'll have a go at it,\" said Don abruptly. He rose from his seat.\n\"Come on, Jane, I'll take you to the Blakinsons.\"\n\n\"Hurry it up!\" I said. \"He's leaving! We'll lose him!\"\n\nThe fellow seemed about to wander on along the street. Don brought\nJane over to the Blakinsons' table which was at the back of the\nrestaurant. We left our check with her and dashed for the street.\n\n\"Where is he? Do you see him?\" Don demanded.\n\nHe had gone. But in a moment we saw him, his white cap towering\nabove the crowd down by the drugstore at the corner.\n\n\"Come on, Don! There he is!\"\n\nWe half ran through the crowd. We caught the fellow as he was\ndiagonally crossing the street. We rushed up, one on each side of\nhim, and seized him by the arms.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n_Tako, the Mysterious_\n\n\nThe fellow towered head and shoulders over Don, and almost that over\nme. He stared down at us, his jaw dropping with surprise. My heart\nwas pounding; to me there was no doubt about it now; this\nheavy-featured handsome, but evil face was the face of the\napparition at whom Don had fired as it hung in the air over the Fort\nBeach path. But this was a man. His arm, as I clutched it, was\nmuscularly solid beneath the sleeve of his flannel jacket.\n\n\"I say,\" Don panted. \"Just a minute.\"\n\nWith a sweep of his arms the stranger angrily flung off our hold.\n\n\"What do you want?\"\n\nI saw, within twenty feet of us, a policeman standing in the street\nintersection.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" Don stammered. We had had no time to plan\nanything. I put in:\n\n\"We thought you were a friend of ours. This night--so much\nexcitement--let's get back to the curb.\"\n\nWe drew the man to the sidewalk as a physician's little automobile\nwith two soldiers in it waded its way slowly through the crowd.\n\nThe man laughed. \"It is an exciting night. I never have seen Bermuda\nlike this before.\"\n\nSwift impressions flooded me. The fellow surely must recognize us as\nwe did him. He was pretending friendliness. I noticed that though he\nseemed not over forty, his close-clipped hair beneath the white\nlinen cap was silver white. His face had a strange pallor, not the\npallor of ill health, but seemingly a natural lack of color. And his\nvoice, speaking good English, nevertheless marked him for a\nforeigner--though of what nation certainly I could not say.\n\n\"We're mistaken,\" said Don. \"But you look like someone we know.\"\n\n\"Do I, indeed? That is interesting.\"\n\n\"Only you're taller,\" I said. \"You're not a Bermudian, are you?\"\n\nHis eyes, beneath the heavy black brows shot me a look. \"No. I am a\nstranger; a visitor. My name----\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe hesitated briefly; then he smiled with what seemed an amused\nirony. \"My name is Tako. Robert Tako. I am living at the Hamiltonia\nHotel. Does that satisfy you?\"\n\nI could think of nothing to say. Nor could Don. The fellow added,\n\"Bermuda is like a little ship. I understand your inquisitiveness--one\nmust know everyone else. And who are you?\"\n\nDon told him.\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" he smiled. \"And so you are a native Bermudian?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And you,\" he said to me, \"you are American?\"\n\n\"From New York, yes.\"\n\n\"That is more interesting. Never have I known an American. You are\nfamiliar with New York City?\"\n\n\"Of course. I was born there.\"\n\nHis contemplative gaze made me shiver. I wondered what Don was\nplanning as an outcome to this. The fellow seemed wholly at ease\nnow. He was lounging against the drug store window with us before\nhim. My eyes were level with the negligee collar of his blue linen\nshirt, and abruptly I was galvanized into alertness. Just above the\nsoft collar where his movements had crushed it down I saw\nunmistakably the loop of a tiny black thread of wire projecting\nupward! Conclusive proof! This was one of the mysterious enemies!\nOne of the apparitions which had thrown all Bermuda into a turmoil\nstood materialized here before us.\n\nI think that Don had already seen the wire. The fellow was saying\nnonchalantly,\n\n\"And you, Mr. Livingston--are you also familiar with New York City?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Don. He had gone pale and tight-lipped. I caught his\nwarning glance to me. \"Yes,\" he repeated. \"I lived there several\nyears.\"\n\n\"I would like to know you two better. Much better--but not tonight.\"\n\nHe moved as though to take his leave of us. Then he added to Don,\n\"That most beautiful young lady with you in the restaurant--did I\nnot see you there? Is that your sister?\"\n\nDon made his decision. He said abruptly, \"That's none of your\nbusiness.\"\n\nIt took the fellow wholly by surprise. \"But listen--\"\n\n\"I've had enough of your insolence,\" Don shouted.\n\nThe man's hand made an instinctive movement toward his belt, but I\nseized his wrist. And I added my loud voice to Don's. \"No, you\ndon't!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA group of onlookers was at once collecting around us. The giant\ntried to cast me off, but I clung to him with all my strength. And\nsuddenly we were struggling to keep the fellow from breaking away\nfrom us. He muttered a strange-sounding oath.\n\n\"Let me go! You fools!\"\n\n\"Not such fools,\" Don shouted. \"Officer! I say--officer!\"\n\nDon's revolver was in his hand; people were pressing around us, but\nwhen they saw the revolver they began scattering. The giant made a\nlunge and broke away from us, heedless that Don might have shot him.\n\n\"What's all this? I say, you three, what are you up to?\"\n\nThe policeman came on a run. A group of soldiers passing on\nbicycles, flung the machines aside and came dashing at us. The giant\nstood suddenly docile.\n\n\"Officer, these young men attacked me.\"\n\n\"He's a liar!\" Don shouted. \"Watch him! He might be armed--don't let\nhim get away from you!\"\n\nThe law surrounded us. \"Here's my weapon,\" said Don. \"Bob, give up\nyour revolver.\"\n\nIn the turmoil Don plucked the policeman aside.\n\n\"I'm nephew of the Honorable Arthur Dorrance. Take us to your chief.\nI made that uproar to catch that big fellow.\"\n\nThe name of the Honorable Arthur Dorrance was magic. The policeman\nstared at our giant captive who now was surrounded by the soldiers.\n\n\"But I say--\"\n\n\"Take us all in and send for Mr. Dorrance. He's at the Government\nHouse.\"\n\n\"But I say--That big blighter--\"\n\n\"We think he's one of the ghosts!\" Don whispered.\n\n\"Oh, my Gawd!\"\n\nWith the crowd following us we were hurried away to the police\nstation nearby.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe sergeant said, \"The Chief will be here in a few minutes. And\nwe've sent for Mr. Dorrance.\"\n\n\"Good enough, Brown.\" It chanced that Don knew this sergeant very\nwell. \"Did you search the fellow?\"\n\n\"Yes. No weapon in his clothes.\"\n\nI whispered, \"I saw a wire under his collar.\"\n\n\"Sh! No use telling that now, Bob.\"\n\nI realized it. These policemen were frightened enough at our\ncaptive. Don added, \"Before my uncle and the Chief arrive, let me\nhave a talk with that fellow, will you?\"\n\nThey had locked him up; and in the excitement of our arrival at the\nstation both Don and I had completely forgotten the wire we had seen\nat his collar. But we remembered it now, and the same thought\noccurred to both of us. We had locked up this mysterious enemy, but\nwould the prison bars hold him?\n\n\"Good Lord!\" Don exclaimed. \"Bob, those wires--Sergeant, we\nshouldn't have left that fellow alone! Is he alone! Come on!\"\n\nWith the frightened mystified sergeant leading us we dashed along\nthe little white corridor to the windowless cell in which the giant\nwas confined. At the cell-door a group of soldiers lounged in the\ncorridor.\n\n\"Smooth talker, that fellow.\"\n\n\"Gor blime me, who is he?\"\n\nWe arrived with a rush. \"Is he in there?\" Don shouted. \"Open the\ndoor, you fellows! See here, you watch him--we've got to get his\nclothes off. He's got some mechanism--wires and things underneath\nhis clothes!\"\n\n\"Get out of the way!\" ordered the sergeant. \"I'll open it!\"\n\nThere was silence from behind the door. The prisoner had been in the\ncell no more than a minute or two.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe burst open the door. The cell was dimly illumined. The figure of\nthe giant stood backed in its further corner. But at the sight of\nhim we all stood transfixed with horror. His shoes, trousers, shirt,\njacket and cap lay in a little pile at his feet. He stood revealed\nin the short tight-fitting silvery garments. The wires were looped\nabout his arms and legs and he had pulled a mesh of them over his\nhead in lieu of a helmet.\n\nHe stood regarding us sardonically. And in that instant while we\nwere stricken with the shock of it, I saw that the figure was\nfading. It was a solid human form no longer! A silvery cast had come\nupon it. Another second passed; it was visibly growing tenuous,\nwraithlike! It was melting while we stared at it, until in that\nbreathless instant I realized that the wall behind it was showing\nthrough.\n\nA wraith! An apparition! The vision of a ghost standing there,\nleering at us!\n\nThe soldiers had retreated back into the corridor behind us. The\nsergeant gripped me, and his other hand, wavering with fright,\nclutched a revolver.\n\n\"But it's--it's going!\"\n\nDon gasped, \"Too late! Sergeant, give me that gun!\"\n\n\"Wait!\" I shouted. \"Don't shoot at it!\"\n\nThe shimmering glowing white figure was slowly moving downward as\nthough floating through the cell-floor. Its own invisible surface\nwas evidently not here but lower down, and it was beginning to drop.\nI don't know what frenzied courage--if courage it could be\ncalled--was inspiring me. I was wholly confused, but nevertheless I\nstruck Don and the sergeant aside and rushed at the thing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a sensation most horrible. From the waist up it was still\nabove the floor of the cell. My wildly flailing arms went through\nthe chest! But I felt nothing. It was not even like waving aside a\nmist. There was nothing. I saw my solid fist plunge through the\nleering ghostly face. I fought wildly, with a panic upon me, against\nthe glowing phosphorescent nothingness of the apparition. My feet\nwere stamping on its chest and shoulders. Then, as it sank lower,\nonly the grinning face was down there.\n\nPanting, and with the cold sweat of horror upon me, I felt Don\nshoving me aside.\n\n\"Too late!\"\n\nAnd then the sergeant's shot rang out. The bullet clattered against\nthe solid stone floor of the cell. The acrid smoke of the powder\nrolled over us; and cleared in a moment to show us the apparition\nseveral feet below the floor level. It seemed to strike its solidity\nof ground. I saw it fall the last little distance with a rush; land,\nand pick itself up. And with a last sardonic grin upward at us, the\ndim white figure ran. Dwindling smaller, dimmer, until in a moment\nit was gone into the Unknown.\n\nAs though a light had struck upon me came the realization.\n\n\"Don, this is rational, this thing! Some strange science!\"\n\nAll day we had been vaguely realizing it. Intangible, but rational\nenemies were stealing white girls of Bermuda. Invaders from another\nplanet? We had thought it might be that. Certainly it was nothing\nsupernatural. These was not ghosts.\n\nBut now came a new realization. \"Don! That's another world down\nthere! Another realm! The fourth dimension--that's what it is! These\nthings everybody's calling ghosts--it's the fourth dimension, Don!\nPeople of the fourth dimension coming out to attack us!\"\n\nAnd already the real menace had come! At that moment, half a mile\naway across the harbor on the slope of the little hill in Paget, an\narmy of the White Invaders suddenly materialized, with dull,\nphosphorescent-green light-beams flashing around the countryside,\nmelting trees and vegetation and people into nothingness!\n\nThe attack upon Bermuda had begun!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n_Ambushed!_\n\n\nThe events which I have now to describe are world history, and have\nbeen written in many forms and by many observers. I must, however,\nsketch them in broadest outline for the continuity of this personal\nnarrative of the parts played by my friends and myself in the dire\nand astounding affair which was soon to bring chaos, not only to\nlittle Bermuda but to the great United States as well, and a near\npanic everywhere in the world.\n\nOn this evening of May 15th, 1938, the White Invaders showed\nthemselves for the first time as rational human enemies. The\nresidential suburb of Paget lies across the little harbor from the\ncity of Hamilton. It is a mile or so by road around the bay, and a\nfew minutes across the water by ferry. The island in the Paget\nsection is a mere strip of land less than half a mile wide in most\nplaces, with the sheltered waters of the harbor on one side, and the\nopen Atlantic with a magnificent pink-white beach on the other. The\ntwo are divided by a razor-back ridge--a line of little hills a\nhundred feet or so high, with narrow white roads and white stone\nresidences set on the hill-slopes amid spacious lawns and tropical\ngardens; and with several lavish hotels on the bay shore, and others\nover the ridge, fronting the beach.\n\nThe invaders landed on the top of the ridge. It seemed that, without\nwarning, a group of white-clad men were in a cedar grove up there.\nThey spread out, running along the roads. They seemed carrying small\nhand-weapons from which phosphorescent-green light-beams flashed\ninto the night.\n\nThe first reports were chaotic. A few survivors appeared in Hamilton\nwho claimed to have been very close to the enemy. But for the most\npart the descriptions came from those who had fled when still a mile\nor more away. The news spread as though upon the wings of a gale.\nWithin an hour the hotels were emptied; the houses all along the\nshore and the bayside hill-slope were deserted by their occupants.\nBoats over there brought the excited people into Hamilton until no\nmore boats were available. Others came madly driving around the\nharbor road, on bicycles, and on foot--and still others escaped\ntoward distant Somerset.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA thousand people or more came in within that hour. But there were\nothers who did not come--those who were living in the score or two\nof houses up on the ridge in the immediate neighborhood of where the\ninvaders appeared....\n\nDon and I met Mr. Dorrance at the police station within a few\nminutes after the news of the Paget attack reached us. We hurried\nback to the restaurant and found Jane still there with the\nBlakinsons. Ten minutes later we were all in the Government House,\nreceiving the most authentic reports available.\n\nFrom the windows of the second floor room where Mr. Dorrance sat\nwith a number of the officials, Don, Jane, and I could see across\nthe harbor and to the ridge where the enemy was operating. It was\nnot much over two miles from us. The huge, slightly flattened moon\nhad risen. The bay and the distant little hills were flooded with\nits light. We could see, off on the ridge-top, the tiny flashing\ngreen beams. But there was no sound save the turmoil of the excited\nlittle city around us.\n\n\"They don't seem to be moving,\" Don murmured. \"They're right where\nthey were first reported.\"\n\nIt seemed as though the small group of light-beams, darting back and\nforth, nevertheless originated from one unshifting place. The beams,\nwe realized, must be extremely intense to be visible even these two\nmiles or so, for we could see that they were very small and of very\nshort range--more like a hand-flashlight than anything else. How\nmany of the enemy were there? They were men, we understood: solid,\nhuman men garbed in the fashion of the apparitions which had been so\nwidely seen.\n\nThe patrolling airplane, connected with us here by wireless\ntelephone, gave us further details. There seemed to be some fifty of\nthe invaders. They stood in a group in what had been a small cedar\ngrove. It was a barren field now; the trees had melted and vanished\nbefore the silent blasts of the green light-beams. They had, these\nbeams, seemingly a range of under a hundred feet. The invaders had,\nat first, run with them along the nearby roads and attacked the\nnearest houses. Part of those houses were still standing, save for\nthe wooden portion of them which had vanished into nothingness as\nthe green light touched it. The people, too, were annihilated. The\nairplane pilot had seen a man running near the field trying to\nescape. The light touched him, clung to him for a moment. There was\nan instant as he fell that he seemed melting into a ghostly figure;\nand then he was gone.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFifty invaders. But they were human; they could be attacked. When\nthey first appeared, the nature of them still unrealized, a\nphysician's automobile, manned by three soldiers, had been coming\nalong the bay road at the foot of the ridge. The soldiers turned it\ninto a cross road and mounted the hill. Two of them left it,\nscouting to see what was happening; the other stayed in the car. One\nof the enemy suddenly appeared. His ray struck the car. Its tires,\nits woodwork, and fabric and cushions melted and vanished, and the\nman within it likewise disappeared. Everything organic vanished\nunder the assailing green beam. The other two soldiers fired at the\nattacker. He was human. He fell as their bullets struck him. Then\nothers of his fellows came running. The two soldiers were driven\naway, but they escaped to tell of the encounter.\n\nThe airplane pilot, half an hour later, flew low and fired down into\nthe group of enemy figures. He thought that one of them fell. He\nalso thought he was out of range of their beams. But a pencil-point\nof the green light thinned and lengthened out. It darted up to his\nhundred-and-fifty-foot altitude and caught one of his wings. The\nplane fell disabled into the bay near the city docks, but the pilot\nswam safely ashore.\n\nI need not detail the confusion and panic of the government\nofficials who were gathered here in the room where Don, Jane and I\nstood watching and listening to the excitement of the incoming\nreports. For quiet little Bermuda the unprecedented situation was\ndoubly frightening. An attack would have to be made upon the\ninvaders. There were only fifty of the enemy; the soldiers and the\npolice could in a few hours be mobilized to rush them and kill them\nall.\n\nBut could that be done? The thing had so many weird aspects, the\ninvaders still seemed so much in the nature of the supernatural,\nthat Mr. Dorrance advised caution. The enemy was now--this was about\nten o'clock in the evening--quietly gathered in the little field on\nthe ridge-top. They seemed, with their first attack over, no longer\noffensive. But, if assailed, who could say what they would do?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd a thousand unprecedented things to do were pressing upon the\nharassed officials. Panic-stricken crowds now surged out of all\ncontrol in the Hamilton streets. Refugees were coming in, homeless,\nneeding care. The soldiers and the police were scattered throughout\nthe islands, without orders of what to do to meet these new\nconditions.\n\nAnd new, ever more frightening reports poured in. The telephone\nservice, which links as a local call nearly every house throughout\nthe islands, was flooded with frantic activity. From nearly every\nparish came reports of half-materialized ghosts. Fifty invaders?\nThere were that many gathered on the Paget hill, but it seemed that\nthere must be a thousand watching apparitions scattered throughout\nthe islands. Harmless, merely frightening, wraiths. But if that\nlittle group in Paget were assailed, this other thousand might in a\nmoment cease to be harmless \"ghosts.\"\n\nThe astounded Bermuda officials were forced now to accept the\nrealization that this was solid science. Incredible, fantastic,\nunbelievable--yet here it was upon us. Some unknown, invisible realm\nco-existed here in this same space. Its inhabitants had found a way\nto come out.\n\nThe government wireless, and the Canadian cables, could no longer\nwithhold such news as this. Bermuda appealed now to Washington and\nto London for help. Warships would be coming shortly. Passenger\nliners on the high seas bringing holiday visitors, were turned\naside. The ships in the port of New York would not sail for Bermuda\ntomorrow.\n\nI think that the outside world would have had jeering publics amused\nat little Bermuda hysterical over a fancied attack from the fabled\nfourth dimension. But by midnight this night, the United States at\nleast was in no mood for jeering. A message came--reaching us soon\nafter eleven o'clock, Bermuda time--by cable, through Halifax from\nWashington. The thing already had passed beyond the scope of the\nBermudas. White apparitions were seen on the Atlantic seaboard near\nSavannah. And then at Charleston; and throughout the night at\nseveral other points farther north. None materialized into solidity.\nBut the \"ghosts\" were seen, appearing, vanishing, and reappearing\nalways farther north.\n\nIt was a world menace!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt about midnight Mr. Dorrance joined Jane, Don and me where we\nstood by the Government House windows watching the distant\nmotionless group of enemy lights. He was pale and harassed.\n\n\"No use for you to stay here,\" he told us. \"Don, you and Bob take\nJane home. It's the safest place now.\"\n\nThe reports seemed to indicate that of all the parishes, St. Georges\nwas now most free of the apparitions.\n\n\"Go home,\" he insisted. \"You and Bob stay with Jane. Take care of\nher, lads.\" He smiled grimly. \"We--all the government--may be moving\nto St. Georges by morning.\"\n\n\"But, father,\" Jane protested, \"what will you do? Stay here?\"\n\n\"For a while. I'll drive over by daybreak. I'll keep the Victoria.\nYou have your cycles; you three ride over. Be careful, lads. You\nhave your revolvers?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Don.\n\nWe had no time for leave-taking. He was at once called away from us.\n\nWe left the Government House shortly after that, got our bicycles\nand started for the north shore road. Government Hill, where the\nroad climbed through a deep cut in the solid rock, was thronged with\ncarriages, and with cyclists walking up the hill. Most of the\ntraffic was going in one direction--refugees leaving this proximity\nto the enemy.\n\nWe reached the top of the hill, mounted and began the long coast\ndown. In an hour and a half or less we would be home.... Ah, if one\ncould only lift the veil which hides even the immediate future, upon\nthe brink of which we must always stand unseeing!\n\nThe north-shore road had the rocky seacoast upon our left--calm\nmoonlit ocean across which in this direction lay the Carolinas some\nseven hundred miles away. We had gone, perhaps three miles from\nHamilton. The road was less crowded here. A group of apparitions had\nbeen seen in the neighborhood of the Aquarium, which was ahead of\nus, and most of the refugees were taking the middle road along\nHarrington Sound in the center of the island.\n\nBut we decided to continue straight on. It was shorter.\n\n\"And there will be more police along here,\" Don reasoned.\n\nHeaven knows we did not feel in immediate danger. Cycling soldiers\npassed us at frequent intervals, giving us the news of what lay\nahead. And we both had revolvers.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe came presently to the bottom of one of the many steep little\nhills up which it is difficult to ride. We were walking up the\ngrade, pushing our machines with Jane between us. A group of\nsoldiers came coasting down the hill, but when we were half-way up\nthey had passed out of sight. It chanced at the moment that we were\nalone on the road. No house was near us. The ocean to our left lay\nat the bottom of a fifty-foot rocky cliff; to the right was a thick\nline of oleander trees, heavy with bloom.\n\nAhead of us, to the right within the line of oleanders, the glowing\nwhite figure of an apparition was visible. We stopped, out of breath\nfrom the climb, and stood by the roadside.\n\n\"See it there?\" Don murmured. \"Let's wait and watch it a moment.\"\n\nOne may get used to anything. We were not frightened. The figure, no\nmore than twenty feet ahead of us, stood partly within a tree-trunk.\nIt could not materialize there. It was the figure of a man, with\nhelmet and looped wires.\n\n\"Not that fellow who called himself Tako,\" I whispered.\n\nThis one was smaller, no larger than Jane, perhaps. He raised his\narms as though warning us to stop. We stood gazing at him, undecided\nwhether to retreat or advance. An omnibus carriage coming from St.\nGeorges stopped at the brow of the hill. Its occupants climbed out\nand began shouting at the apparition, at the same time flinging\nstones, one of which came bounding past us.\n\n\"Hi!\" I called. \"Stop that! No sense to that!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSuddenly I heard a rustling of the oleanders at my side. We had no\nwarning; our attention was wholly upon the apparition and the men by\nthe carriage on the brow of the hill flinging stones. There was a\nrustling; the shadowed oleanders parted and figures leaped upon us!\n\nI recall hearing Don shout, and Jane cry out. Our cycles clattered\nto the road. I fired at an oncoming white figure, but missed. The\nsolid form of a man struck me and I went down, tangled in my wheel.\nThere was an instant when I was conscious of fighting madly with a\nhuman antagonist. I was conscious of Don fighting, too. Jane stood,\ngripped by a man. Four or five of them had leaped upon us.\n\nI had many instant impressions; then as I fought something struck my\nhead and I faded into insensibility. I must have recovered within a\nmoment. I was lying on the ground, partly upon a bicycle.\n\nDon was lying near me. White figures of men with Jane in their midst\nwere standing off the road, partly behind the bushes. They were\nholding her, and one of them was swiftly adjusting a network of\nwires upon her. Then, as I revived further, I heard shouts; people\nwere arriving from down the hill. I tried to struggle to my feet,\nbut fell back.\n\nIn the bushes the figures--and the figure of Jane--were turning\nsilvery; fading into wraiths. They drifted down into the ground.\nThey were gone.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n_Into the Enemy Camp_\n\n\n\"But Bob, I won't go back to Government House,\" Don whispered.\n\"Lord, we can't do that--get in for theories and questions and plans\nto gather a police squad. Every minute counts.\"\n\n\"What can we do?\"\n\n\"Break away from these fellows--send Uncle Arthur a\nmessage--anything at all; and say we'll be back in half an hour. I\ntell you, Jane is gone--they've got her. You saw them take her. By\nnow probably, they've got her off there in Paget among them. We've\ngot to do something drastic, and do it now. If the police\nattacked--suppose Jane is in that Paget group--the first thing\nthey'd do when the police came at them would be to kill her. We\ncan't go at it that way, I tell you.\"\n\nWe were trudging back up Government Hill with a group of soldiers\naround us. I had revived to find myself not seriously injured; a\nlump was on my head and a scalp wound where something had struck me.\nDon had regained consciousness a moment later and was wholly\nunharmed. His experience had been different from mine. Two men had\nseized him. He was aware of a sudden puff of an acrid gas in his\nface, and his senses had faded. But when they returned he had his\nfull strength almost at once.\n\nWe realized what had happened. Half a dozen of the enemy were lying\nin ambush there on the roadside. It was young white girls they were\nafter, and when we appeared with Jane, one of the invaders showed\nhimself as an apparition to stop us, and then the others, fully\nmaterialized and hiding in the oleanders, had leaped upon us. They\nhad had only time to escape with Jane, ignoring Don and me where we\nhad fallen. They seemed also not aware of the nature of our weapons\nfor they had not taken our revolvers.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHad they gone now with Jane into the other realm of the Unknown? Or\nwas she with them, over in Paget now in the little enemy camp there\nwhich was defying Bermuda? We thought very possibly it was the\nlatter. The giant who had called himself Tako, who had escaped us in\nthe Police Station, had been driven from our minds by all the\nexcitement which followed. Was that Tako the leader of these\ninvaders? Had he, for some time perhaps, been living as he said in\nthe Hamiltonia Hotel? Scouting around Bermuda, selecting the young\ngirls whom his cohorts were to abduct?\n\nThe thoughts made us shudder. He had noticed Jane. He it was,\ndoubtless, who as an apparition had prowled outside Jane's room the\nnight before last. And last night he had followed us to the Fort\nBeach. And again to-night in the restaurant he had been watching\nJane. These men who had captured Jane now might very well carry her\nto Paget and hand her over to their leader, this giant Tako.\n\nA frenzy of desperation was upon Don and me at the thought.\n\n\"But what shall we do?\" I whispered.\n\n\"Get away from these soldiers, Bob. We've got our revolvers. We'll\nride over there to Paget--just the two of us. It's our best chance\nthat way. Creep up and see what's over there. And if Jane is there,\nwe've got to get her, Bob--get her some way, somehow.\"\n\nWe could plan no further than that. But to return to Government\nHouse, to face Jane's father with the tale of what had happened, and\nthen become involved in an official attempt to attack with open\nhostilities the enemy in Paget--that was unthinkable.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt the foot of Government Hill, with a trumped-up excuse, Don got us\naway from our escort. The night was far darker now; a gray-white\nmass of clouds had come up to obscure the moon. We cycled through\nthe outskirts of Hamilton to the harbor road and followed it around\nthe marshy end of the bay and into Paget. There had been at first\nmany vehicles coming in from the beach, but when we passed the\nintersection and nothing lay ahead of us but the Paget ridge we\nfound the road deserted.\n\nWe had had our handle-bar flash-lights turned on, but now we shut\nthem off, riding slowly into the darkness. Don presently dismounted.\n\n\"Better leave our wheels here.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nWe laid them on the ground in a little roadside banana patch. We\nwere no more than a quarter of a mile from the enemy now; the glow\nof their green beams standing up into the air showed on the\nridge-top ahead of us.\n\n\"We'll take the uproad,\" Don whispered. \"Shall we? And when we get\nto the top, follow some path, instead of a road.\"\n\n\"All right,\" I agreed.\n\nWe started on foot up the steep side road which led from the bay\nshore to the summit of the ridge. The houses here were all dark and\ndeserted, their occupants long since having fled to Hamilton. It was\nenemy country here now.\n\nWe reached the summit and plunged into a cedar grove which had a\nfootpath through it. The green light-beams seemed very close; we\ncould see them in a little group standing motionless up into the\ndarkness of the sky.\n\n\"Can't plan,\" Don whispered. \"But we must keep together. Get up as\nclose as we can and see what conditions are.\"\n\nAnd see if Jane were here.... It echoed through my head, and I knew\nit was also Don's guiding thought.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnother ten minutes. We were advancing with the utmost caution. The\ncedar grove was almost black. Then we came to the end of it. There\nwas a winding road and two white houses a hundred feet or so apart.\nAnd beyond the houses was a stretch of open field, strangely denuded\nof vegetation.\n\n\"There they are, Bob!\" Don sank to the ground with me beside him. We\ncrouched, revolvers in hand, gazing at the strange scene. The field\nhad been a cedar grove, but all the vegetation now was gone, leaving\nonly the thin layer of soil and the outcropping patches of Bermuda's\nfamous blue-gray rock. The houses, too, had been blasted. One was on\nthis side of the field, quite near us. Its walls and roof had\npartially fallen; its windows and door rectangles yawned black and\nempty, with the hurricane shutters and the wooden window casements\ngone and the panes shattered into a litter of broken glass.\n\nBut the house held our attention only a moment. Across the\ntwo-hundred-foot field we could plainly see the invaders--forty or\nfifty men's figures dispersed in a little group. It seemed a sort of\nencampment. The green light beams seemed emanating from small hand\nprojectors resting now on the ground. The sheen from them gave a\ndull lurid-green cast to the scene. The men were sitting about in\nsmall groups. And some were moving around, seemingly assembling\nlarger apparatus. We saw a projector, a cylindrical affair, which\nhalf a dozen of them were dragging.\n\n\"Bob! Can you make out--back by the banana grove--captives? Look!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe encampment was at the further corner of the naked field. A\nlittle banana grove joined it. We could see where the enemy light\nhad struck, partially melting off some of the trees so that now they\nstood leprous. In the grove were other figures of men, and it seemed\nthat among them were some girls. Was Jane there among those\ncaptives?\n\n\"We've got to get closer,\" I whispered. \"Don, that second house--if\nwe could circle around and get there. From the corner of it, we'd be\nhidden.\"\n\n\"We'll try it.\"\n\nThe farther house was also in ruins. It stood near the back edge of\nthe naked field and was within fifty feet of the banana grove. We\ncircled back, and within ten minutes more were up against the broken\nfront veranda of the house.\n\n\"No one here,\" Don whispered.\n\n\"No, evidently not.\"\n\n\"Let's try getting around the back and see them from the back\ncorner.\"\n\nWe were close enough now to hear the voices in the banana grove. The\nhalf-wrecked house against which we crouched was a litter of stones\nand broken glass. It was black and silent inside.\n\n\"Don, look!\"\n\nSidewise across the broken veranda the group of figures in the field\nwere partly visible. We saw ghostly wraiths now among them--apparitions\nthree or four feet above the ground. They solidified and dropped to\nearth, with their comrades gathering over them. The babble of voices\nin a strange tongue reached us. New arrivals materializing!\n\nBut was Jane here? And Tako, the giant? We had seen nothing of\neither of them. These men seemed all undersized rather than\ngigantic. We were about to start around the corner of the veranda\nfor a closer view of the figures in the grove, when a sound near at\nhand froze us. A murmur of voices! Men within the house!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI pulled Don flat to the ground against the stone steps of the\nporch. We heard voices; then footsteps. A little green glow of light\nappeared. We could see over the porch floor into the black yawning\ndoor rectangle. Two men were moving around in the lower front room,\nand the radiation from their green lights showed them plainly. They\nwere small fellows in white, tight-fitting garments, with the black\nhelmet and the looped wires.\n\n\"Don, when they come out--\" I murmured it against his ear. \"If we\ncould strike them down without raising an alarm, and get those\nsuits--\"\n\n\"Quiet! They're coming!\"\n\nThey extinguished their light. They came down the front steps, and\nas they reached the ground and turned aside Don and I rose up in the\nshadows and struck at them desperately with the handles of our\nrevolvers. Don's man fell silently. Mine was able to ward off the\nblow; he whirled and flashed on his little light. But the beam\nmissed me as I bent under it and seized him around the middle,\nreaching up with a hand for his mouth. Then Don came at us, and\nunder his silent blow my antagonist wilted.\n\nWe had made only a slight noise; there seemed no alarm.\n\n\"Get them into the house,\" Don murmured. \"Inside; someone may come\nany minute.\"\n\nWe dragged them into the dark and littered lower room. We still had\nour revolvers, and now I had the small hand-projector of the green\nlight-beam. It was a strangely weightless little cylinder, with a\nfiring mechanism which I had no idea how to operate.\n\nIn a moment we had stripped our unconscious captives of their white\nwoven garments. In the darkness we were hopelessly ruining the\nmechanism of wires and dials. But we did not know how to operate the\nmechanism in any event; and our plan was only to garb ourselves like\nthe enemy. Thus disguised, with the helmets on our heads, we could\nget closer, creep among them and perhaps find Jane....\n\nThe woven garments which I had thought metal, stretched like rubber\nand were curiously light in weight. I got the impression now that\nthe garments, these wires and disks, the helmet and the belt with\nits dial-face--all this strange mechanism and even the green-ray\nprojector weapon--all of it was organic substance. And this\nafterward proved to be the fact.[1]\n\n    [1] As we later learned, the scientific mechanism by which\n    the transition was made from the realm of the fourth\n    dimension to our own earthly world and back again, was only\n    effective to transport organic substances. The green\n    light-beam was of similar limitation. An organic substance\n    of our world upon which it struck was changed in vibration\n    rate and space-time co-ordinates to coincide with the\n    characteristics with which the light-current was endowed.\n    Thus the invaders used their beams as a weapon. The light\n    flung whatever it touched of organic material with horrible\n    speed of transition away into the Unknown--to the fourth,\n    fifth, or perhaps still other realms. In\n    effect--annihilation.\n\n    The mechanism of wires and dials (and small disks which were\n    storage batteries of the strange current) was of slower,\n    more controllable operation. Thus it could be used for\n    transportation--for space-time traveling, as Earth\n    scientists later came to call it. The invaders, wearing this\n    mechanism, materialized at will into the state of matter\n    existing in our world--and by a reversal of the co-ordinates\n    of the current, dematerialized into the more tenuous state\n    of their own realm.\n\nWe were soon disrobed and garbed in the white suits of our enemies.\nThe jacket and trunks stretched like rubber to fit us.\n\n\"Can't hope to get the wires right,\" Don whispered. \"Got your\nhelmet?\"\n\n\"Yes. The belt fastens behind, Don.\"\n\n\"I know. These accursed little disks, what are they?\"\n\nWe did not know them for storage batteries as yet. They were thin\nflat circles of flexible material with a cut in them so that we\ncould spring the edges apart and clasp them like bracelets at\nintervals on our arms and legs. The wires connected them, looped up\nto the helmet, and down to the broad belt where there was an\nindicator-dial in the middle of the front.[2]\n\n    [2] We were soon to learn also that they were bringing into\n    our world weapons, food, clothing and a variety of equipment\n    by encasing the articles in containers operated by these\n    same mechanisms of wires carrying the transition current.\n    The transportation was possible because all the articles\n    they brought with them were of organic substance.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe worked swiftly and got the apparatus on somehow. The wires,\nbroken and awry, would not be noticed in the darkness.\n\n\"Ready, Don?\"\n\n\"Yes. I--I guess so.\"\n\n\"I've got this light cylinder, but we don't know how to work it.\"\n\n\"Carry it openly in your hand. It adds to the disguise.\" There was a\nnote of triumph in Don's voice. \"It's dark out there--only the green\nglow. We'll pass for them, Bob, at a little distance anyway. Come\non.\"\n\nWe started out of the room. \"You can hide your revolver in the\nbelt--there seems to be a pouch.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nWe passed noiselessly to the veranda. Over our bare feet we were\nwearing a sort of woven buskin which fastened with wires to the\nankle disks.\n\n\"Keep together,\" Don whispered. \"Take it slowly, but walk openly--no\nhesitation.\"\n\nMy heart was pounding, seemingly in my throat, half-smothering me.\n\"Around the back corner of the house,\" I whispered. \"Then into the\nbanana grove. Straighten.\"\n\n\"Yes. But not right among them. A little off to one side, passing by\nas though we were on some errand.\"\n\n\"If they spot us?\"\n\n\"Open fire. Cut and run for it. All we can do, Bob.\"\n\nSide by side we walked slowly along the edge of the house. At the\nback corner, the small banana grove opened before us. Twenty feet\naway, under the spreading green leaves of the trees a dozen or so\nmen were working over apparatus. And in their center a group of\ncaptive girls sat huddled on the ground. Men were passing back and\nforth. At the edge of the trees, by the naked field, men seemed\npreparing to serve a meal. There was a bustle of activity\neverywhere; a babble of strange, subdued voices.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe were well under the trees now. Don, choosing our route, was\nleading us to pass within ten or fifteen feet of where the girls\nwere sitting. It was dark here in the grove; the litter of rotted\nleaves on the soft ground scrunched and swished under our tread.\n\nThere was light over by the girls. I stared at their huddled forms;\ntheir white, terrified faces. Girls of Bermuda, all of them young,\nall exceptionally pretty. I thought I recognized Eunice Arton. But\nstill it seemed that Jane was not here.... And I saw men seated\nwatchfully near them--men with cylinder weapons in their hands.\n\nDon occasionally would stoop, poking at the ground as though looking\nfor something. He was heading us in a wide curve through the grove\nso that we were skirting the seated figures. We had already been\nseen, of course, but as yet no one heeded us. But every moment we\nexpected the alarm to come. My revolver was in the pouch of my belt\nwhere I could quickly jerk it out. I brandished the useless light\ncylinder ostentatiously.\n\n\"Don!\" I gripped him. We stopped under a banana tree, half hidden in\nits drooping leaves. \"Don--more of them coming!\"\n\nOut in the empty field, apparitions of men were materializing. Then\nwe heard a tread near us, and stiffened. I thought that we were\ndiscovered. A man passed close to us, heading in toward the girls.\nHe saw us; he raised a hand palm outward with a gesture of greeting\nand we answered it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor another two or three minutes we stood there, peering, searching\nfor some sign of Jane.... Men were distributing food to the girls\nnow.\n\nAnd then we saw Jane! She was seated alone with her back against a\nbanana tree, a little apart from the others. And near her was a\nseated man's figure, guarding her.\n\n\"Don! There she is! We can get near her! Keep on the way we were\ngoing. We must go in a wide curve to come up behind her.\"\n\nWe started forward again. We were both wildly excited; Jane was at\nthe edge of the lighted area. We could come up behind her; shoot her\nguard; seize her and dash off.... I saw that the mesh of wires,\ndisks and a helmet were on Jane....\n\nDon suddenly stumbled over something on the ground. A man who had\nbeen lying there, asleep perhaps, rose up. We went sidewise, and\npassed him.\n\nBut his voice followed us. Unintelligible, angry words.\n\n\"Keep on!\" I murmured. \"Don't turn!\"\n\nIt was a tense moment. The loud words brought attention to us. Then\nthere came what seemed a question from someone over by the girls. We\ncould not answer it. Then two or three other men shouted at us.\n\nDon stopped, undecided.\n\n\"No!\" I whispered. \"Go ahead! Faster Don! It's darker ahead.\"\n\nWe started again. It seemed that all the camp was looking our way.\nVoices were shouting. Someone called a jibe and there was a burst of\nlaughter. And from behind us came a man's voice, vaguely familiar,\nwith a sharp imperative command.\n\nShould we run? Could we escape now, or would a darting green beam\nstrike us? And we were losing our chance for Jane.\n\nDesperation was on me. \"Faster, Don!\"\n\nThe voice behind us grew more imperative. Then from nearby, two men\ncame running at us. An uproar was beginning. We were discovered!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDon's revolver was out. It seemed suddenly that men were all around\nus. From behind a tree-trunk squarely ahead a figure appeared with\nleveled cylinder. The ground leaves were swishing behind us with\nswiftly advancing footsteps.\n\n\"Easy, Bob!\"\n\nDon found his wits. If he had not at that moment we would doubtless\nhave been annihilated in another few seconds. \"Bob, we're\ncaught--don't shoot!\"\n\nI had flung away the cylinder and drawn my revolver; but Don shoved\ndown my extended hand and held up his own hand.\n\n\"We're caught!\" He shouted aloud. \"Don't kill us! Don't kill us!\"\n\nIt seemed that everywhere we looked was a leveled cylinder. I half\nturned at the running footsteps behind us. A man's voice called in\nEnglish.\n\n\"Throw down your weapons! Down!\"\n\nDon cast his revolver away, and mine followed. I was aware that Jane\nhad recognized Don's voice, and that she was on her feet staring in\nour direction with horrified eyes.\n\nThe man from behind pounced upon us. It was the giant, Tako.\n\n\"Well, my friends of the restaurant! The American who knows New York\nCity so well! And the Bermudian! This is very much to my liking. You\nthought your jail would imprison me, did you not?\"\n\nHe stood regarding us with his sardonic smile, while our captors\nsurrounded us, searching our belts for other weapons. And he added,\n\"I was garbed like you when we last met. Now you are garbed like me.\nHow is that?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey led us into the lighted area of the grove. \"The American who\nknows New York City so well,\" Tako added. \"And the Bermudian says he\nknows it also. It is what you would call an affair of luck, having\nyou here.\"\n\nHe seemed highly pleased. He gazed at us smilingly. We stood silent\nwhile the men roughly stripped the broken wires and disks from us.\nThey recognized the equipment. There was a jargon of argument in\ntheir strange guttural language. Then at Tako's command three of\nthem started for the house.\n\nJane had cried out at sight of us. Her captor had ordered her back\nto her seat by the tree.\n\n\"So?\" Tako commented. \"You think silence is best? You are wise. I am\nglad you did not make us kill you just now. I am going to New York\nand you shall go with me; what you know of the city may be of help.\nWe are through with Bermuda. There are not many girls here. But in\nthe great United States I understand there are very many. You shall\nhelp us capture them.\"\n\nDon began, \"The girl over there----\"\n\n\"Your sister? Your wife? Perhaps she knows something of New York and\nits girls also. We will keep her close with us. If you three choose\nto help me, you need have no fear of harm.\" He waved aside the men\nwith imperious commands. \"Come, we will join this girl of yours. She\nis very pretty, is she not? And like you--not cowardly. I have not\nbeen able to make her talk at all.\"\n\nThe dawn of this momentous night was at hand when, with the networks\nof wires and disks properly adjusted upon us, Tako took Jane, Don\nand me with him into the Fourth Dimension.\n\nStrange transition! Strange and diabolical plot which now was\nunfolded to us! Strangely fantastic, weird journey from this Bermuda\nhilltop through the Unknown to the city of New York!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n_The Attack upon New York_\n\n\nI must sketch now the main events following this night of May 15th\nand 16th as the outside world saw them. The frantic reports from\nBermuda were forced into credibility by the appearance of\napparitions at many points along the Atlantic seaboard of the\nsouthern States. They were sporadic appearances that night. No\nattacks were reported. But in all, at least a thousand wraithlike\nfigures of men must have been seen. The visitations began at\nmidnight and ended with dawn. To anyone, reading in the morning\npapers or hearing from the newscasters that \"ghosts\" were seen at\nSavannah, the thing had no significance. But in Washington, where\nofficials took a summary of all the reports and attempted an\nanalysis of them, one fact seemed clear. The wraiths were traveling\nnorthward. It could almost be fancied that this was an army,\ntraveling in the borderland of the Unknown. Appearing momentarily as\nthough coming out to scout around and see the contour and the\ncharacteristics of our realm; disappearing again into invisibility,\nto show themselves in an hour or so many miles farther north.\n\nThe reports indicated also that it was not one group of the enemy,\nbut several--and all of them traveling northward. The most northerly\ngroup of them by dawn showed itself up near Cape Hatteras.\n\nThe news, when it was fully disseminated that next day, brought a\nmingling of derision and terror from the public. The world rang with\nthe affair. Remote nations, feeling safe since nothing of the kind\nseemed menacing them, were amused that distant America, supposedly\nso scientifically modern, should be yielding to superstition worthy\nonly of the Middle Ages. The accounts from Bermuda were more\ndifficult to explain. And England, with Bermuda involved, was not\nskeptical; as a matter of fact, the British authorities were\nastonished. Warships were starting for Bermuda; and that morning of\nMay 16th, with the passenger lines in New York not sailing for\nBermuda, American warships were ordered to Hamilton. The menace,\nwhatever it was, would soon be ended.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat was May 16th. Another night passed, and on May 17th the world\nrang with startled horror and a growing terror. Panics were\nbeginning in all the towns and cities of the American seaboard north\nof Cape Hatteras. It was no longer a matter of merely seeing\n\"ghosts.\" There had been real attacks the previous night.\n\nThere had been a variety of incidents, extraordinarily\nhorrifying--so diverse, so unexpected that they could not have been\nguarded against. It was a dark night, an area of low pressure with\nleaden storm-clouds over all the Atlantic coastal region, from\nCharleston north to the Virginia Capes. A coastal passenger ship off\nHatteras sent out a frantic radio distress call. The apparitions of\nmen had suddenly been seen in mid-air directly in the ship's course.\nThe message was incoherent; the vessel's wireless operator was\nlocked in his room at the transmitter, wildly describing an attack\nupon the ships.\n\nThe white apparitions--a group of twenty or thirty men--had been\nmarching in mid-air when the ship sighted them directly over its\nbow. In the darkness of the night they were only a hundred feet\nahead when the lookout saw them. In a moment the vessel was under\nthem, and they began materializing.... The account grew increasingly\nincoherent. The figures materialized and fell to the deck, picked\nthemselves up and began running about the ship, attacking with\nlittle green light-beams. The ship's passengers and crew vanished,\nobliterated; annihilated. It seemed that young women among the\npassengers were being spared. The ship was melting--the wooden\ndecks, all the wooden super-structure melting.... A few moments of\nfantastic horror, then the distress call died into silence as\ndoubtless the green light-beams struck the operator's little cabin.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat vessel was found the next day, grounded on the shoals off\nHatteras. The sea was oily and calm. It lay like a gruesome shell,\nas though some fire had swept all its interior. Yet not fire either,\nfor there were no embers, no ashes. Diseased, leprous, gruesomely\nweird with parts of its interior intact and other parts obliterated.\nAnd no living soul was upon it save one steward crouching in a lower\ncabin laughing with madness which the shock of what he had seen\nbrought upon him.\n\nOn land, a railroad train in Virginia had been wrecked, struck\napparently by a greenish ray. And also in Virginia, during the early\nevening in a village, an outdoor festival at which there were many\nyoung girls was attacked by apparitions suddenly coming into\nsolidity. The report said that thirty or more young girls were\nmissing. The little town was in chaos.\n\nAnd the chaos, that next day, spread everywhere. It was obvious now\nthat the enemy was advancing northward. In Washington, Baltimore,\nPhiladelphia, panics were beginning. New York City was seething with\nexcitement. People were leaving all the towns and cities of the\narea. An exodus north and westward. In New York, every steamship,\nairplane and railroad train was crowded with departing people. The\nroads to Canada and to the west were thronged with outgoing\nautomobiles.\n\nBut it was only a small part of the millions who remained. And the\ntransportation systems were at once thrown into turmoil, with the\nsudden frantic demands threatening to break them down. And then a\nnew menace came to New York. Incoming food supplies for its millions\ncrowded into that teeming area around Manhattan, were jeopardized.\nThe army of men engaged in all the myriad activities by which the\ngreat city sustained itself were as terrified as anyone else. They\nbegan deserting their posts. And local communication systems went\nawry. The telephones, the lights, local transportation--all of them\nbegan limping, threatening to break.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTremendous, intricate human machine by whose constant activity so\nmany millions are enabled to live so close together! No one could\nrealize how vastly interwoven are a million activities which make\nlife in a great city comfortable and safe until something goes\nwrong! And one wrong thing so swiftly affects another! As though in\na vastly intricate mechanism little cogs were breaking, and the\nbreaks spreading until presently the giant fly-wheels could no\nlonger turn.\n\nIf the startled Federal and State officials could have foreseen even\nthe events of the next forty-eight hours they would have wanted New\nYork City deserted of the population. But that was impossible. Even\nif everyone could have been frightened into leaving, the chaos of\nitself would have brought death to untold thousands.\n\nAs it was, May 17th and 18th showed New York in a growing chaos.\nOfficials now were wildly trying to stem the panics, trying to keep\norganized the great machines of city life.\n\nIt is no part of my plan for this narrative to try and detail the\nevents in New York City as the apparitions advanced upon it. The\ncrowded bridges and tunnels; the traffic and transportation\naccidents; the failure of the lights and telephones and broadcasting\nsystems; the impending food shortage; the breaking out of disease\nfrom a score of causes; the crushed bodies lying in the streets\nwhere frantic mobs had trampled them and no one was available to\ntake them away. The scenes beggar description.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd in all this the enemy had played no part save that of causing\nterror. Warships gathered in New York harbor were impotent. State\ntroops massed in New Jersey, across the Hudson from New York, and in\nPutnam and Westchester Counties, were powerless to do more than try\nand help the escaping people since there was no enemy of tangible\nsubstance to attack. Patrolling airplanes, armed with bombs, were\nhelpless. The white apparitions were gathering everywhere in the\nneighborhood of New York City. But they remained only apparitions,\nimponderable wraiths, non-existent save that they could be dimly\nseen. And even had they materialized, no warships could shell the\ncity, for millions of desperate people were still within it trying\nto get away.\n\nThe news from little Bermuda was submerged, unheeded, in this\ngreater catastrophe. But on the night of May 17th when the American\nwarships arrived off Hamilton, the Paget invaders were gone.\n\nThe menace in Bermuda was over; it was the great New York City which\nwas menaced now. The apparitions which had advanced from the south\nwere suddenly joined by a much more numerous army. On the night of\nMay 19th it had reached New York. Two or three thousand glowing\nwhite shapes were apparent, with yet other thousands perhaps\nhovering just beyond visibility. They made no attack. They stood\nencamped on the borderland of the Unknown realm to which they\nbelonged. Busy with their preparations for battle and watching the\nstricken city to which already mere terror had brought the horror of\ndisease and death.\n\nIt seemed now that this Fourth Dimension terrain co-existing within\nin the space of New York City, must be a tumbled, mountainous region\nof crags and spires, and yawning pits, ravines and valley depths.\nJagged and precipitous indeed, for there were apparitions encamped\nin the air above Manhattan and harbor--higher in altitude than the\nChrysler or the Empire State towers. Other wraiths showed in a dozen\nplaces lower down--some within the city buildings themselves. And\nyet others were below ground, within the river waters, or grouped\nseemingly a hundred feet beneath the street levels.\n\nFantastic army of wraiths! In the daylight they almost faded, but at\nnight they glowed clearly. Busy assembling their weapons of war.\nVanishing and reappearing at different points. Climbing or\ndescending the steep cliffs and crags of their terrain to new points\nof vantage; and every hour with their numbers augmenting. And all so\nsilent! So grimly purposeful, and yet so ghastly silent!\n\nIt was near midnight of May 19th when the wraiths began\nmaterializing and the attack upon New York City began!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n_The Invisible World_\n\n\nTako showed us how to operate the transition mechanism. The little\nbanana grove on the Bermuda hilltop began fading. There was a\nmomentary shock; a reeling of my head; a sudden sense of vibration\nwithin me. And then a feeling of lightness, weightlessness; and\nfreedom, as though all my earthly life I had been shackled, but now\nwas free.\n\nThe thing was at first terrifying, gruesome; but in a moment those\nfeelings passed and the weightless freedom brought an exuberance of\nspirit.\n\nDon and I were sitting with Jane between us, and the figure of Tako\nfronting us. I recall that we clung together, terrified. I closed my\neyes when the first shock came, but opened them again to find my\nhead steadying. Surprising vista! I had vaguely fancied that Tako,\nJane and Don would be sitting here dissolving into apparitions. But\nmy hands on Jane's arm felt it as solid as before. I stared into her\nface. It was frightened, white and set, but smiling at me.\n\n\"You all right, Bob? It's not so difficult, is it?\"\n\nShe had endured this before. She reached out her hands, one to Don\nand one to me.\n\n\"We're dropping. I don't think it's far down, but be careful.\nStraighten your legs under you.\"\n\nWe seemed unchanged; Don and Jane were the same in aspect as before,\nsave the color of their garments seemed to have faded to a gray. It\nwas the Bermuda hilltop which to our vision was changing. The grove\nwas melting, turning from green and brown to a shimmering silver. We\nnow looked upon ghostly, shadowy trees; fading outlines of the\nnearby house; the nearby figures of Tako's men and the group of\ncaptive girls--all shadowy apparitions. The voices were fading; a\nsilence was falling upon us with only the hum of the mechanism\nsounding in my ears.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI felt with a shock of surprise that I was no longer seated on the\nground. I seemed, for an instant floating, suspended as though\nperhaps immersed in water. The sweep of the ground level was a vague\nshadowy line of gray, but my legs had dropped beneath it. I was\ndrifting down, sinking, with only Jane's hand to steady me.\n\n\"Thrust your feet down,\" she murmured. \"A little fall. We want to\nland on our feet.\"\n\nThe imponderable ground of the banana grove was rising. We dropped,\nas though we were sinking in water. But we gathered speed; we felt a\nweight coming to our bodies. At last we fell; my feet struck a solid\nsurface with a solid impact. Don and I lost our balance, but Jane\nsteadied us. We were standing upon a dark rock slope, steeply\ninclined.\n\n\"Off with the current!\" came Tako's voice. \"The belt switch--throw\nit back!\"\n\nI found the little lever. The current went off. There had been a\nmoment when the spectral shadows of my own world showed in the air\nabove me. But we passed their visible limits and they faded out of\nsight.\n\nWe were in the realm of the Fourth Dimension. Outdoors, in a region\nof glowing, phosphorescent night....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"This way,\" said Tako. \"It is not far. We will walk. Just a moment,\nyou three. I would not have you escape me.\"\n\nOur revolvers were gone. Being metal, they could not, of actuality,\nbe carried into the transition. We had no light-beam cylinders, nor\ndid we as yet know how to use them. Tako stood before us; he reached\nto the operating mechanisms under the dial-face at our belts, making\nsome disconnections which we did not understand.\n\nHis smile in the semi-darkness showed with its familiar irony. \"You\nmight have the urge to try some escaping transition. It would lose\nyou in the Unknown. That would be death! I do not want that.\"\n\nI protested, \"We are not fools. I told you if you would spare us,\nreturn us safely to Bermuda when this is over--\"\n\n\"That you might be of help to me,\" he finished. \"Well, perhaps you\nwill. I hope so. You will do what you can to help, willingly or\notherwise; that I know.\" His voice was grimly menacing. And he\nlaughed sardonically. \"You are no fools, as you say. And Jane--\" His\nglance went to her. \"Perhaps, before we are through with this, you\nmay even like me, Jane.\"\n\nWhatever was in his mind, it seemed to amuse him.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Jane.\n\nWe three had had only a moment to talk together. There had been no\npossibility of escape. It was obvious to us that Tako was the leader\nof these invaders; and, whatever they were planning, our best chance\nto frustrate it was to appear docile. Safety for us--the possibility\nof later escaping--all of that seemed to lie in a course of\ndocility. We would pretend friendliness; willingness to help.\n\nTako was not deceived. We knew that. Don, in those two or three\nhours we were with Tako before starting upon the transition, had\nsaid:\n\n\"But suppose we do help you in your scheme, whatever it is? There\nmight be some reward for us, eh? If you plan a conquest, riches\nperhaps--\"\n\nTako had laughed with genuine amusement. \"So? You bargain? We are to\nbe real friends--fellow conquerors? And you expect me to believe\nthat?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nYet now he seemed half to like us. And there was Jane's safety for\nwhich we were scheming. Tako had been interested in Jane. We knew\nthat. Yet she was at first little more to him than one of the girl\ncaptives. He might have left her with those others. But she was with\nus now, to stay with us upon this journey, and it was far\npreferable.\n\n\"This way,\" said Tako. \"We will walk. It is not far to my encampment\nwhere they are preparing for the trip.\"\n\nIt seemed that a vast open country was around us. A rocky, almost\nbarren waste; a mountainous region of steep gray defiles, gorges and\nbroken tumbled ravines. A void of darkness hung overhead. There were\nno stars, no moon, no light from above. Yet I seemed presently to\nsee a great distance through the glowing deep twilight. The glow was\ninherent to the rocks themselves; and to the spare, stunted,\ngray-blue vegetation. It was a queerly penetrating, diffused, yet\nvague light everywhere. One could see a considerable distance by it.\nDim colors were apparent.\n\nWe trod the rocks with a feeling of almost normal body weight. The\nair was softly warm like a night in the tropics, with a faint breeze\nagainst our faces. It seemed a trackless waste here. We mounted an\nascending ramp, topped a rise with an undulating plateau ahead of\nus.\n\nTako stood a moment for us to get our breath. The air seemed\nrarefied; we were panting, with our cheeks tingling.\n\n\"My abode is there.\" He gestured to the distant lowland region\nbehind us. We were standing upon a gray hilltop. The ground went\ndown a tumbled broken area to what seemed a lowland plain. Ten miles\naway--it may have been that, or twice that--I saw the dim outline of\na great castle or a fortress. A building of gigantic size, it seemed\nstrangely fashioned with round-shaped domes heaped in a circle\naround a tower looming in the center. A wall, or a hedge of giant\ntrees, I could not tell, but it seemed as gigantic as the wall of\nChina, and was strung over the landscape in an irregular circle to\nenclose an area of several square miles, with the castle-fortress in\nits center. A little city was there, nestled around the fortress--a\nhundred or two small brown and gray mounds to mark the dwellings. It\nsuggested a little feudal town of the Middle Ages of our own Earth,\nset here in this trackless waste.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd I saw, down on the plain, a shining ribbon of river with thick\nvegetation along its banks. And within the enclosing wall there, was\nthe silvery sheen of a lake near the town; patches of trees, and\nbrownish oval areas which seemed to be fields under cultivation.\n\n\"My domain,\" Tako repeated. There was a touch of pride in his voice.\n\"I rule it. You shall see it--when we are finished with New York.\"\n\nAgain his gaze went to Jane, curiously contemplative. We started\nwalking over the upper plateau level, seemingly with nothing in\nadvance of us save empty luminous darkness. A walk of an hour.\nPerhaps it was that long. Time here had faded with our Earthly\nworld. It was difficult to gauge the passing minutes--as difficult\nas to guess at the miles of this luminous distance.\n\nAs though the sight of his fortress--his tiny principality, whose\ninhabitants he ruled with absolute sway--had awakened in Tako new\nemotions, he put Jane beside him and began talking to us with\napparent complete frankness. It must have been an hour, during which\nhe explained this world of his, of which we were destined to have so\nbrief a glimpse, and told us upon what diabolical errand he and his\nfellows were embarked. I recall that as he talked Jane gripped me in\nhorror. But she managed to smile when Tako smiled at her. He was\nnaively earnest as he told us of his coming conquest. And Jane, with\nwoman's intuition knew before Don and I realized it, that it was to\nherself, a beautiful girl of Earth, he was talking, seeking her\nadmiration for his prowess.\n\nTako was what in Europe of the Middle Ages would have amounted to a\nfeudal prince. He was one of many here in this realm; each had his\nlittle domain, with his retainers cultivating his land, paying fees\nto him so that the overlord lived in princely idleness.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nScattered at considerable distances, one from the other, these\nrulers of their little principalities were loosely bound into a\ngeneral government; but at home each was a law unto himself. They\nlived in princely fashion, these lords of the castle, as they were\ncalled. Among the retainers, monogamy was practiced. The workers had\ntheir little families--husband, wife and children. But for the\nrulers, more than one wife was the rule. Within each castle was a\nharem of beauties, drawn perforce from the common people. The most\nbeautiful girls of each settlement were trained from childhood to\nanticipate the honor of being selected by the master for a life in\nthe castle.\n\nThey were connoisseurs of woman's beauty, these overlords. By the\nsize of his harem and the beauty and talent of its inmates was an\noverlord judged by his fellows.\n\nOut of this had grown the principal cause for war in the history of\nthe realm. Beautiful girls were scarce. Raids were made by one lord\nupon the village and harem of another.\n\nThen had come to Tako the discovery of the great world of our Earth,\noccupying much of this same space in another state of matter.\n\n\"I discovered it,\" he said with his gaze upon Jane.\n\n\"How?\" Don demanded.\n\n\"It came,\" he said, \"out of our scientific method of transportation,\nwhich very soon I will show you. We are a scientific people. Hah!\"\nHe laughed ironically. \"The workers say that we princes are\nprofligate--that we think only of women and music. But that is not\nso. Once, many generations ago, we were a tremendous nation, and\nskilled in science far beyond your own world--and with a population\na hundred times what we have now. The land everywhere must have been\nrich and fertile. There were big cities--the ruins of them are still\nto be seen.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"And then our climate changed. There was, for us, a world\ncatastrophe, the cause and the details of which no one now knows\nvery clearly. It sent our cities, our great civilizations into\nruins. It left us with this barren waste with only occasional\nlowland fertile spots which now by heredity we rulers control, each\nto possess his own.\n\n\"But that past civilization gave us a scientific knowledge. Much of\nit is lost--we are going down hill. But we have some of it left, and\nwe profligate rulers, as the workers call us, cherish it. But what\nis the use of teaching it to the common people? We do very little of\nthat. And our weapons of war we keep to ourselves--except when there\nis a raid and our loyal retainers go forth with us to do battle.\"\n\n\"So you discovered how to get into our Earth world?\" Don repeated.\n\n\"Yes. Some years ago, and it was quite by chance. At first I\nexperimented alone--and then I took with me a young girl.\"\n\nAgain he smiled at Jane. \"Tolla is her name. She is here in our camp\nwhere our army is now, starting for New York. You will meet her\npresently. She loves me very much, so she says. She wants some day\nto lead my harem. I took her with me into the Unknown--into that\nplace you call Bermuda. I have been there off and on for nearly a\nyear of your Earth time, making my plans for what now is at last\ncoming to pass.\"\n\n\"So that's how you learned our language?\" I said.\n\n\"Yes. It came easy to me and Tolla. That--and we were taught by two\ngirls whom a year ago I took from Bermuda and brought in here.\"\n\n\"And what became of them?\" Jane put in quietly.\n\n\"Oh--why, I gave them away,\" he replied calmly. \"A prince whose\nfavor I desired, wanted them and I gave them to him. Your Earth\ngirls are well liked by the men of my world. Their fame has already\nspread.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe added contemplatively, \"I often have thought how strange it is\nthat your great world and mine should lie right here together--the\none invisible to the other. Two or three minutes of time--we have\njust made the transition. Yet what a void!\"\n\n\"The scientists of your past civilization,\" I said, \"strange that\nthey did not learn to cross it.\"\n\n\"Do you know that they did not?\" he demanded. \"Perhaps with secret\nvisitations--\"\n\nIt brought to us a new flood of ideas. We had thought, up there in\nSt. Georges, that this Tako was a ghost. How could one say but that\nall or most manifestations of the occult were not something like\nthis. The history of our Earth abounds with superstition.\nGhosts--things unexplained. How can one tell but that all occultism\nis merely unknown science? Doubtless it is. I can fancy now that in\nthe centuries of the past many scientists of this realm of the\nFourth Dimension ventured forth a little way toward our world. And\nseeing them, we called them ghosts.\n\nWhat an intrepid explorer was this Tako! An enterprising scoundrel,\nfired with a lust for power. He told us now, chuckling with the\ntriumph of it, how carefully he had studied our world. Appearing\nthere, timidly at first, then with his growing knowledge of English,\nboldly living in Hamilton.\n\nHis fame in his own world, among his fellow rulers, rapidly grew.\nThe few Earth girls he produced were eagerly seized. The fame of\ntheir beauty spread. The desire, the competition for them became\nkeen. And Tako gradually conceived his great plan. A hundred or more\nof the overlords, each with his hundred retainers, were banded\ntogether for the enterprise under Tako's leadership. An army was\norganized; weapons and equipment were assembled.\n\nEarth girls were to be captured in large numbers. The most desirable\nof them would go into the harems of the princes. The others would be\ngiven to the workers. The desire for them was growing rapidly,\nincited by the talk of the overlords. The common man could have more\nthan one wife--two, even three perhaps--supported by the princely\nmaster. And Tako was dreaming of a new Empire; increased population;\nsome of the desert reclaimed; a hundred principalities banded\ntogether into a new nation, with himself as its supreme leader.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd then the attack upon Earth had begun. A few Earth girls were\nstolen; then more, until very quickly it was obvious that a wider area\nthan Bermuda was needed. Tako's mind flung to New York--greatest\ncenter of population within striking distance of him.[3] The foray\ninto Bermuda--the materialization of that little band on the Paget\nhilltop was more in the nature of an experiment than a real attack.\nTako learned a great deal of the nature of this coming warfare, or\nthought he did.\n\n    [3] The extent of the Fourth Dimensional world was never\n    made wholly clear to us. Its rugged surface was coincident\n    with the surface of our earth at Bermuda, at New York City,\n    and at many points along the Atlantic seaboard of the United\n    States. For the rest, there is no data upon which one may\n    even guess.\n\nAs a matter of actuality, in spite of his dominating force, the\ncapacity for leadership which radiated from him, there was a very\nnaive, fatuous quality to this strange ruler. Or at least, Don and I\nthought so now. As the details of his plot against our Earth world\nunfolded to us, what we could do to circumvent him ran like an\nundercurrent across the background of our consciousness. He knew\nnothing, or almost nothing of our Earth weapons. What conditions\nwould govern this unprecedented warfare into which he was\nplunging--of all that he was totally ignorant.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut, we were speedily to learn that he was not as fatuous as he at\nfirst seemed. These two worlds--occupying the same space and\ninvisible to each other--would be plunged into war. And Tako\nrealized that no one, however astute, of either world could predict\nwhat might happen. He was plunging ahead, quite conscious of his\nignorance. And he realized that there was a vast detailed knowledge\nof the Earth world which we had and he did not. He would use us as\nthe occasion arose to explain what might not be understandable to\nhim.\n\nI could envisage now so many things of such a character. The range\nof warships and artillery. The weapons a plane might use. The\ntopography of New York City and its environs.... And the more Tako\nneeded us, the less we had to fear from him personally. We would\nhave the power to protect Jane from him--if we could sufficiently\npersuade him he needed our good will. Ultimately we might plunge his\nenterprise into disaster, and with Jane escape from him--that too I\ncould envisage as a possibility.\n\nThe mind flings far afield very rapidly! But I recall that it\noccurred to me also that I might be displaying many of the fatuous\nqualities I was crediting to Tako, by thinking such thoughts!\n\nI have no more than briefly summarized the many things Tako told us\nduring that hour while we strode across the dim rocky uplands toward\nhis mobilized army awaiting its departure for the scene of the main\nattack. Some of his forces had already gone ahead. Several bands of\nmen were making visual contact with the seacoast of the southern\nUnited States. It was all experimentation. They were heading for New\nYork. They would wait there, and not materialize until this main\narmy had joined them.\n\nWe saw presently, in the distance ahead of us, a dim green sheen of\nlight below the horizon. Then it disclosed itself to be quite\nnear--the reflection of green light from a bowl-like depression of\nthis rocky plateau.\n\nWe reached the rim of the bowl. The encampment of Tako's main army\nlay spread before us.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n_The Flight through the Fourth Dimension_\n\n\n\"This is the girl, Tolla,\" said Tako quietly. \"She will take care of\nyou, Jane, and make you comfortable on this trip.\"\n\nIn the dull green sheen which enveloped the encampment, this girl of\nthe Fourth Dimension stood before us. She had greeted Tako quietly\nin their own language, but as she gazed up into his face it seemed\nthat the anxiety for his welfare turned to joy at having him safely\narrive. She was a small girl; as small as Jane, and probably no\nolder. Her slim figure stood revealed, garbed in the same white\nwoven garments as those worn by the men. At a little distance she\nmight have been a boy of Earth, save that her silvery white hair was\nwound in a high conical pile on her head, and there were tasseled\nornaments on her legs and arms.\n\nHer small oval face, as it lighted with pleasure at seeing Tako, was\nbeautiful. It was delicate of feature; the eyes pale blue; the lips\ncurving and red. Yet it was a curious face, by Earth standards. It\nseemed that there was an Oriental slant to the eyes; the nose was\nhigh-bridged; the eyebrows were thin pencil lines snow-white, and\nabove each of them was another thin line of black, which evidently\nshe had placed there to enhance her beauty.\n\nStrange little creature! She was the only girl of this world we were\ndestined to meet; she stood beside Jane, seemingly so different, and\nyet, we were to learn, so humanly very much the same. Her quiet gaze\nbarely touched Don and me; but it clung to Jane and became\ninscrutable.\n\n\"We will travel together,\" Tako said. \"You make her comfortable,\nTolla.\"\n\n\"I will do my best,\" she said; her voice was soft, curiously limpid.\n\"Shall I take her now to our carrier?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nIt gave me a pang to see Jane leave with her; Don shot me a sharp,\nquestioning glance but we thought it best to raise no objection.\n\n\"Come,\" said Tako. \"Stay close by me. We will be in the carrier\npresently.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was an area here in the bowl-like depression of at least half\na mile square upon which an assemblage of some five thousand or more\nmen were encamped. It was dark, though an expanse of shifting\nshadows and dull green light mingled with the vague phosphorescent\nsheen from the rocks. The place when we arrived was a babble of\nvoices, a confusion of activity. The encampment, which obviously was\ntemporary--perhaps a mobilization place--rang with the last minute\npreparations for departure. Whatever habitations had been here now\nwere packed and gone.\n\nTako led us past groups of men who were busy assembling and carrying\nwhat seemed equipment of war toward a distant line of oblong objects\ninto which men were now marching.\n\n\"The carriers,\" said Tako. He greeted numbers of his friends,\ntalking to them briefly, and then hurried us on. All these men were\ndressed similarly to Tako, but I saw none so tall, nor so commanding\nof aspect. They all stared at Don and me hostilely, and once or\ntwice a few of them gathered around us menacingly. But Tako waved\nthem away. It brought me a shudder to think of Jane crossing this\ncamp. But we had watched Tolla and Jane starting and Tolla had\npermitted none to approach them.\n\n\"Keep your eyes open,\" Don whispered. \"Learn what you can. We've got\nto watch our chance--\" We became aware that Tako was listening. Don\nquickly added, \"I say, Bob, what does he mean--carriers?\"\n\nI shrugged. \"I don't know. Ask him.\"\n\nWe would have to be more careful; it was obvious that Tako's hearing\nwas far keener than our own. He was fifteen feet away, but he turned\nhis head at once.\n\n\"A carrier you would call in Bermuda a tram. Or a train, let us\nsay.\" He was smiling ironically at our surprise that he had\noverheard us. He gestured to the distant oblong objects. \"We travel\nin them. Come, there is really nothing for me to do; all is in\nreadiness here.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe vehicles stood on a level rocky space at the farther edge of the\ncamp. I think, of everything I had seen in this unknown realm, the\nsight of these vehicles brought the most surprise. The glimpse we\nhad had of Tako's feudal castle seemed to suggest primitiveness.\n\nBut here was modernity--super-modernity. The vehicles--there were\nperhaps two dozen of them--were all apparently of similar character,\ndiffering only in size.\n\nThey were long, low oblongs. Some were much the size and shape of a\nsingle railway car; others twice as long; and several were like a\nvery long train, not of single joined cars, but all one structure.\nThey lay like white serpents on the ground--dull aluminum in color\nwith mound-shaped roofs slightly darker. Rows of windows in their\nsides with the interior greenish lights, stared like round goggling\neyes into the night.\n\nWhen we approached closer I saw that the vehicles were not of solid\nstructure, but that the sides seemingly woven of wire-mesh--or woven\nof thick fabric strands.[4]\n\n    [4] The vehicles were constructed of a material allied in\n    character to that used for garments by the people of this\n    realm. It was not metal, but an organic vegetable substance.\n\nThe army of white figures crowded around the vehicles. Boxes, white\nwoven cases, projectors and a variety of disks and dials and wire\nmechanisms were being loaded aboard. And the men were marching in to\ntake their places for the journey.\n\nTako gestured. \"There is our carrier.\"\n\nIt was one of the smallest vehicles--low and streamlined, so that it\nsuggested a fat-bellied cigar, white-wrapped. It stood alone, a\nlittle apart from the others, with no confusion around it. The\ngreen-lighted windows in its sides goggled at us.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe entered a small porte at its forward pointed end. The control\nroom was here, a small cubby of levers and banks of dial-faces.\nThree men, evidently the operators, sat within. They were dressed\nlike Tako save that they each had a great round lens like a monocle\non the left eye, with dangling wires from it leading to dials\nfastened to the belt.\n\nTako greeted them with a gesture and a gruff word and pushed us past\nthem into the car. We entered a low narrow white corridor with dim\ngreen lights in its vaulted room. Sliding doors to compartments\nopened from one side of it. Two were closed; one was partly open. As\nwe passed, Tako called softly:\n\n\"All is well with you, Tolla?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" came the girl's soft voice.\n\nI met Don's gaze. I stopped short and called:\n\n\"Are you all right, Jane?\"\n\nI was immensely relieved as she answered, \"Yes, Bob.\"\n\nTako shoved me roughly. \"You presume too much.\"\n\nThe corridor opened into one main room occupying the full ten-foot\nwidth of the vehicle and its twenty-foot middle section. Low soft\ncouch seats were here, and a small table with food and drink upon\nit; and on another table low to the floor, with a mat-seat beside\nit, a litter of small mechanical devices had been deposited. I saw\namong them two or three of the green-light hand weapons.\n\nTako followed my gaze and laughed. \"You are transparent. If you knew\nhow to use those weapons, do you think I would leave them near you?\"\n\nWe were still garbed in the white garments, but the disks and wires\nand helmet had been taken from us.\n\n\"I say, you needn't be so suspicious,\" Don protested. \"We're not so\nabsolutely foolish. But if you want any advice from us on how to\nattack New York, you've got to explain how your weapons are used.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTako seated us. \"All in good time. We shall have opportunity now to\ntalk.\"\n\n\"About the trip--\" I said. \"Are we going to New York City?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"How long will it take?\"\n\n\"Long? That is difficult to say. Have you not noticed that time in\nmy world has little to do with yours?\"\n\n\"How long will it seem?\" I persisted.\n\nHe shrugged. \"That is according to your mood. We shall eat once or\ntwice, and get a little sleep.\"\n\nOne of the window openings was beside us with a loosely woven mesh\nof wires across it. Outside I could see the shifting lights. Men\nwere embarking in the other vehicles; and the blended noise from\nthem floated in to us.\n\nQuestions flooded me. This strange journey, what would it be like? I\ncould envisage the invisible little Bermuda in the void of darkness\nover us now; or here in this same space around us. No, we had\nclimbed from where we landed in the space close under the Paget\nhilltop. And we had walked forward for perhaps an hour. The space of\nBermuda would be behind us and lower down. This then was the open\nocean. I gazed at the solid rocky surface outside our window. Nearly\nseven hundred miles away must be New York City. We were going there.\nHow? Would it be called flying? Or following this rocky surface?\n\nAs though to answer my thoughts Tako gestured to the window. \"See.\nThe first carrier starts away.\"\n\nThe carrier lay like a stiff white reptile on the ground. Its doors\nwere closed, and watching men stood back from it.\n\nDon gasped, \"Why--it's fading! A transition!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt glowed along all its length and grew tenuous of aspect, until in\na moment that solid thing which had been solidly resting there on a\nrock was a wraith of vehicle. A great oblong apparition--the ghost\nof a reptile with round green spots on its sides. A fading wraith.\nBut it did not quite disappear. Hovering just within visibility, it\nslowly, silently slid forward. It seemed, without changing its\nlevel, to pass partly through an upstanding crag which stood in its\npath. Distance dimmed it, dwindled it; and in a moment it was gone\ninto the night.\n\n\"We will start,\" said Tako abruptly. \"Sit where you are. There will\nbe a little shock, much like the transition coming in from your\nworld.\" He called, \"Tolla, we start.\"\n\nA signal-dial was on the room wall near him. He rose and pressed its\nlever. There was a moment of silence. Then the current went on. It\npermeated every strand of the material of which the vehicle was\nconstructed. It contacted with our bodies. I felt the tingle of it;\nfelt it running like fire through my veins. The whole interior was\nhumming. There was a shock to my senses, swiftly passing, followed\nby a sense of weightless freedom. But that lightness was an\nillusion, a comparison with externals only, for the seat to which I\nclung remained solid, and my body pressed upon it with a feeling of\nnormal weight.\n\nOutside the window, the dark scene of rocks and vehicles and men was\nfading; turning ghostly, shadowy, spectral. But it did not quite\nvanish; it held its wraithlike outlines, and in a moment began\nsliding silently backward. It seemed that we also passed through a\nlittle butte of rocks. Then we emerged again into the open; and, as\nwe gathered speed, the vague spectral outlines of a rocky landscape\nslid past us in a bewildering panorama.\n\nWe were away upon the journey.[5]\n\n    [5] What we learned of the science of the invisible realm\n    was perforce picked piecemeal by us from all that we saw,\n    experienced, and what several different times Tako was\n    willing to explain to us. And it was later studied by the\n    scientists of our world, whose additional theories I can\n    incorporate into my own knowledge. Yet much of it remains\n    obscure. And it is so intricate a subject that even if I\n    understood it fully I could do no more than summarize here\n    its fundamental principles.\n\n    The space-transition of these vehicles, Tako had already\n    told us, was closely allied to the transition from his world\n    to ours. And the weapons were of the same principles. The\n    science of space-transition, limited to travel from one\n    portion of the realm to another, quite evidently came first.\n    The weapons, the forcible, abrupt transition of material\n    objects out of the realm into other dimensions--into the\n    Unknown--this principle was developed from the traveling.\n    And from them both Tako himself evolved the safe and\n    controlled transition from his world to ours.\n\n    Concerning the operation of these vehicles: Motion, in our\n    Earth-world or any other, is the progressive change of a\n    material object in relation to its time and space. It is\n    here now, but it _was there_. Both space and time undergo a\n    simultaneous change; the object itself remains unaltered,\n    save in its _position_.\n\n    In the case of the vehicles, the current I have already\n    mentioned (used in the mechanism for the transition from\n    Earth to the other realm) that current, circulating in the\n    organic material of which the vehicle was composed, altered\n    the state of matter of the carrier and everything within the\n    aura of the current's field. The vehicle and all its\n    contents, with altered inherent vibratory rate of its\n    molecules, atoms and electrons, was in effect projected into\n    another world. A new dimension was added to it. It became an\n    imponderable wraith, resting dimly visible in a sort of\n    borderland upon the fringe of its own world.\n\n    Yet it had not changed _position_. It still remained\n    quiescent. Then the current was further altered, and the\n    time and space co-ordinates set into new combinations. This\n    change of the current was a _progressive_ change. Controlled\n    and carefully calculated by what intricate theoretic\n    principles and practical mechanisms no scientist of our\n    world can yet say.\n\n    It is clear, however, that as this progressive change in\n    space-time characteristics began, the vehicle perforce must\n    move slightly in space and time to reconcile itself to the\n    change.\n\n    There never has been a seemingly more abstruse subject for\n    the human mind to grasp than the theories involving a true\n    conception of space-time. Yet, doubtless, to those of Tako's\n    realm, inheriting, let me say, the consciousness of its\n    reality, there was nothing abstruse about it.\n\n    An analogy may make it clearer. The vehicle, hovering in the\n    borderland, might be called in a visible but gaseous state.\n    A solid can be turned to gas merely by the alteration of the\n    vibratory rate of its molecules.\n\n    This unmoving (gaseous) vehicle, is now further altered in\n    space-time characteristics. Suppose we say it is very\n    slightly thrown out of tune with its _spatial_ surroundings\n    at the time which is its _present_. Nature will allow no\n    such disorganization. The vehicle, as a second of _time_\n    passes, is impelled by the force of nature to be in a\n    _different place_. This involves motion. A small change in\n    the first second. Then the current alters it progressively\n    faster. The change, of necessity, is progressively greater,\n    the motion more rapid.\n\n    And this, controlled as to direction, became transportation.\n    The determination of direction at first thought seems\n    amazingly intricate. In effect, that was not so. With\n    space-time factors set as a destination, i. e., the place\n    where the vehicle must end its change at a certain time, all\n    the intermediate changes become automatic. With every\n    passing second it must be at a reconcilable place--the\n    direction of its passage perforce being the shortest path\n    between the two.\n\n    With this in mind, the transition from one world to another\n    becomes more readily understandable. No _natural_ change of\n    space is involved, merely the change of the state of matter.\n    It was the same change as that which carried the vehicles\n    into a shadowy borderland, and then pushed further into new\n    dimensional realms.\n\n    The green light-beam weapons were merely another application\n    of the same principle. The characteristics of the green\n    light current, touching organic matter, altered the\n    vibratory rate of what was struck to coincide with the\n    light. A solid cake of ice under a blow-torch becomes steam\n    by the same principle. The light-beams were swift and\n    violent in their action. The change in them was progressive\n    also--but it was so swiftly violent a change that nothing\n    living could survive the shock of the enforced transition.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was little to see during this strange flight. Outside our\nwindows gray shadows drifted swiftly past--a shadowy, ghostly\nlandscape of gray rocks. Sometimes it was below us, so that we\nseemed in an airship winging above it. Then abruptly it would rise\nover us and we plunged into it as though it were a mere light-image,\na mirage.\n\nHours passed. For the most part the shadowy void seemed a jagged\nmountainous terrain, a barren waste. There were great plateau\nuplands, one of which rose seemingly thousands of feet over us. And\nthere was perhaps an hour of time when the surface of the world had\ndropped far away, so far down that it was gone in the distance. Like\na projectile we sped level, unswerving. And at last the shadows of\nthe landscape came up again. And occasionally we saw shadowy\ninhabited domains--enclosing walls around water and vegetation, with\na frowning castle and its brood of mound-shaped little houses like\nbaby chicks clustered around the mother hen.\n\nTako served us with a meal; it was strange food, but our hunger made\nit palatable. Jane and Tolla remained in their nearby cabin. We did\nnot see them, but occasionally Don or I, ignoring Tako's frown,\ncalled out to Jane, and received her ready answer.\n\nOccasionally also, we had an opportunity to question Tako. He had\nbegun tell us the general outline of his plans. The important fact\nwas that the army would mobilize just within visibility of New York.\n\n\"Nothing can touch us then,\" Tako said. \"You will have to explain\nwhat weapons will be used against me. Particularly the long-range\nweapons are interesting. But you have no weapons which could\npenetrate into the shadows of the borderland, have you?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Don. \"But your weapons--\" He tried not to seem too\nintent. \"Look here, Tako, I don't just understand how you intend to\nconquer New York.\"\n\n\"Devastate it,\" Tako interrupted. \"Smash it up, and then we can\nmaterialize and take possession of it. My object is to capture a\ngreat number of young women--beautiful young women.\"\n\n\"How?\" I demanded. \"By smashing up New York? There are thousands of\nyoung women there, but you would kill them in the process. Now if\nyou would try some other locality. For instance, I could direct you\nto open country--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe understood my motive. \"I ask not that kind of advice. I will\ncapture New York; devastate it. I think then your rulers will be\nwilling voluntarily to yield all the captives I demand. Or, if not,\nthen we will plan to seize them out of other localities.\"\n\nDon said, \"Suppose you tell us more clearly just how you expect to\nsmash New York, as you call it. First, you will gather, not\nmaterialized, but only visible to the city.\"\n\n\"Exactly. That will cause much excitement, will it not?\nPanics--terror. And if we are only wraiths, no weapons of your world\ncan attack us.\"\n\n\"Nor can yours attack the city. Can they?\"\n\nHe did not at first answer that; and then he smiled. \"Our hand\nlight-projectors could not penetrate out from the borderland without\nlosing their force. But we have bombs. You shall see.[6] The bombs\nalone will devastate New York, if we choose to use them. I have also\na long-range projector of the green light-beam. It is my idea, when\nthe city is abandoned by the enemy that we can take possession of\nsome prominent point of vantage. A tall building, perhaps.\" He\nsmiled again his quiet grim smile. \"We will select one and be\ncareful to leave it standing. I will materialize with our giant\nprojector, dominate all the region and then we can barter with your\nauthorities. It is your long-range guns I most fear. When the\nprojector is materialized--and we are ready to bargain--then your\nairplanes, warships lying far away perhaps, might attack. Suppose\nnow you explain those weapons to me.\"\n\n    [6] Materialization bombs, we afterward called them; they\n    played a diabolical part in the coming events. They were of\n    many sizes and shapes, but most of them were small in size\n    and shape, like a foot-long wedged-shaped brick, or the head\n    of an ax. They were constructed of organic material, with a\n    wire mesh of the transition mechanism encasing them, and an\n    automatic operating device like the firing fuse of a bomb.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor an hour or more he questioned us. He was no fool, this fellow;\nhe knew far more of the conditions ahead of him than we realized. I\nrecall that once I said:\n\n\"You have never been in New York?\"\n\n\"No. Not materialized. But I have observed it very carefully.\"\n\nAs a lurking ghost!\n\n\"We have calculated,\" he went on, \"the space co-ordinates with great\nprecision. That is how we have been able to select the destination\nfor this carrier now. You cannot travel upon impulse by this method.\nOur engineers, as you might call them, must go in advance with\nrecording apparatus. Nothing can be done blindly.\"\n\nIt brought to my mind the three pilots now operating our vehicle. I\nmentioned the lens on their left eyes like a monocle.\n\n\"With that they can see ahead of us a great distance. It flings the\nvision--like gazing along a beam of light--to space-time factors in\nadvance of our present position. In effect, a telescope.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere were a few hours of the journey when Don and I slept,\nexhausted by what we had been through. Tako was with us when we\ndozed off, and I recall that he was there when we awakened. How much\ntime passed we could not tell.\n\n\"You are refreshed?\" he said smilingly. \"And hungry again, no doubt.\nWe will eat and drink--and soon we will arrive at the predestined\ntime and place.\"\n\nWe were indeed hungry again. And while we were eating Tako gestured\nto the window. \"Look there. Your world seems visible a little.\"\n\nJust before we slept it had seemed that mingled with the shadows of\nTako's world was the gray outline of an ocean surface beneath us. I\ngazed out at the dim void now. Our flight was far slower than\nbefore. We were slackening speed for the coming halt. And I saw now\nthat the shadows outside were the mingled wraiths of two spectral\nworlds, with us drifting forward between and among them. The terrain\nof Tako's world was bleaker, more desolate and more steeply\nmountainous than ever. There were pits and ravines and gullies with\njagged mountain spires, cliffs and towering gray masses of rock.\n\nAnd mingled with it, in a general way coincidental with it in the\nplane of the same space, we could see now the tenuous shapes of our\nown world. Vague, but familiar outlines! We had passed Sandy Hook!\nThe ocean lay behind us. A hundred feet or so beneath us was the\nlevel water of the Lower Bay.\n\n\"Don!\" I murmured. \"Look there! Long Island off there! And that's\nStaten Island ahead of us!\"\n\n\"Almost at our destination,\" Tako observed. And in a moment he\ngestured again. \"There is your city. Have a good look at your dear\nNew York.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDiagonally ahead through the window we saw the spectres of the great\npile of masonry on lower and mid-Manhattan. Spectres of the giant\nbuildings; the familiar skyline, and mingled with it the ghostly\ngray outlines of the mountains and valley depths of Tako's world.\nAll intermingled! The mountain peaks rose far higher than the\ntallest of New York's skyscrapers; and the pits and ravines were\nlower than the waters of the harbor and rivers, lower than the\nsubways and the tubes and the tunnels.\n\n\"Another carrier!\" Don said abruptly. \"See it off there!\"\n\nIt showed like a great gray projectile coming in level with us. And\nthen we saw two others in the distance behind us. Fantastic, ghostly\narrival of the enemy! Weird mobilization here within the space of\nthe doomed New York.\n\n\"Can they see us?\" I murmured. \"Tako, the people down there on\nStaten Island--can they see us?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he smiled. \"Don't you think so? Look! Are not those ships of\nwar? Hah! Gathered already--awaiting our coming!\"\n\nI have already given a brief summary of the events of the days and\nnights just past here in New York. The terror at the influx of\napparitions. The panic of the city's teeming millions struggling too\neagerly to escape.\n\nIt was night now--the night of May 19th. The city was in chaos, but\nnone of the details were apparent to us as we arrived. But we could\nsee, as we drifted with slow motion above the waters of the harbor,\nthat there were warships anchored here, and in the Hudson River.\nThey showed as little spectral dots of gray. And in the air, level\nwith us at times, the wraiths of encircling airplanes were visible.\n\n\"They see us,\" Tako repeated.\n\nThey did indeed. A puff of light and up-rolling smoke came from one\nof the ships. A silent shot. Perhaps it screamed through us, but we\nwere not aware of it.\n\nTako chuckled. \"They get excited, do they not? We strike terror--are\nthey going to fight like excited children?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe were under sudden bombardment. Fort Wadsworth was firing; puffs\nshowed from several of the warships; and abruptly a group of ghostly\nmonoplanes dove at us like birds. They went through us, emerged and\nsped away. And in a moment the shots were discontinued.\n\n\"That is better,\" said Tako. \"What a waste of ammunition.\"\n\nOur direction was carrying us from mid-Manhattan. The bridges to\nBrooklyn were visible. Beyond them, over New York, mingled with\nteeming buildings was a mountain slope of Tako's realm. I saw one of\nour carriers lying on a ledge of it.\n\nA sudden commotion in our car brought our attention from the scene\noutside. The voices of girls raised in anger. Tolla's voice and\nJane's! Then came the sound of a scuffle!\n\n\"By what gods!\" Tako exclaimed.\n\nWe all leaped to our feet. Tako rushed for the door of the\ncompartment with us after him. We burst in upon the girls. They were\nstanding in the center of the little room. One of the chairs was\noverturned. Jane stood gripping Tolla by the wrists, and with\ngreater strength was forcibly holding her.\n\nAs we appeared, Jane abruptly released her, and Tolla sank to the\nfloor and burst into wild sobs. Jane faced us, red and white of\nface, and herself almost in tears.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" Don demanded. \"What is it?\"\n\nBut against all our questionings both girls held to a stubborn\nsilence.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n_A Woman Scorned_\n\n\nJane afterward told us just what happened in that compartment of the\ncarrier, and I think that for the continuity of my narration I had\nbest relate it now.\n\nThe cubby room was small, not much over six feet wide, and twelve\nfeet long. There was a single small door to the corridor, and two\nsmall windows. A couch stood by them; there were two low chairs, and\na small bench-like table.\n\nTolla made Jane as comfortable as possible. Food was at hand; Tolla,\nafter an hour or two served it at the little table, eating the meal\nwith Jane, and sitting with her on the couch where they could gaze\nthrough the windows.\n\nTo Jane this girl of another world was at once interesting,\nsurprising and baffling. Jane could only look upon her as an enemy.\nIn Jane's mind there was no thought save that we must escape, and\nfrustrate Tako's attack upon New York; and she was impulsive,\nyouthful enough to think something might be contrived.\n\nAt all events, she saw Tolla in the light of an enemy who might be\ntricked into giving information.\n\nJane admits that her ideas were quite as vague as our own when it\ncame to planning anything definite.\n\nShe at first studied Tolla, who seemed as young as herself and\nperhaps in her own world, was as beautiful. And within an hour or\ntwo she was surprised at Tolla's friendliness. They had dined\ntogether, gazed through the windows at the speeding shadows of the\nstrange world sliding past; they had dozed together on the couch.\nDuring all this they could have been schoolgirl friends. Not captor\nand captive upon these strange weird circumstances of actuality, but\nfriends of one world. And in outward aspect Tolla could fairly well\nhave been a cultured girl of our Orient.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen Jane got a shock. She tried careful questions. And Tolla\nskillfully avoided everything that touched in any way upon Tako's\nfuture plans. Yet her apparent friendliness, and a certain girlish\nvolubility continued.\n\nAnd then, at one point, Tolla asked:\n\n\"Are you beautiful in Bermuda?\"\n\n\"Why, yes,\" said Jane. \"I guess so.\"\n\n\"I am beautiful in my world. Tako has said so.\"\n\n\"You love him, don't you?\" Jane said abruptly.\n\n\"Yes. That is true.\" There was no hint of embarrassment. Her pale\nblue eyes stared at Jane, and she smiled a little quizzically. \"Does\nit show so quickly upon my face that you saw it at once? I am called\nTolla because I am pledged soon to enter Tako's harem.\"\n\nUpon impulse Jane put her arm around the other girl as they sat on\nthe couch. \"I think he is very nice.\"\n\nBut she saw it was an error. The shadow of a frown came upon Tolla's\nface; a glint of fire clouded her pale, serene eyes.\n\n\"He will be the greatest man of his world,\" she said quietly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was an awkward silence. \"The harem, I am told,\" Jane said\npresently, \"is one of your customs.\" She took a plunge. \"And Tako\ntold us why they want our Earth girls. There was one of my friends\nstolen from Bermuda--\"\n\n\"And yet you call him very nice,\" Tolla interrupted with sudden\nirony. \"Girls are frank in our world. But you are not. What did you\nmean by that?\"\n\n\"I was trying to be friendly,\" said Jane calmly. \"You had just said\nyou loved him.\"\n\n\"But you do not love him?\"\n\nIt took Jane wholly back. \"Good Heavens, no!\"\n\n\"But he--might readily love you?\"\n\n\"I hope not!\" Jane tried to laugh, but the idea itself was so\nfrightening to her that the laugh sounded hollow. She gathered her\nwits. This girl was jealous. Could she play upon that jealousy?\nWould Tolla perhaps soon want her to escape? The idea grew. Tolla\nmight even some time soon come to the point of helping her escape.\n\nJane said carefully, \"I suppose I was captured with the idea of\ngoing into someone's harem. Was that the idea?\"\n\n\"I am no judge of men's motives,\" said Tolla curtly.\n\n\"Tako said as much as that,\" Jane persisted. \"But not necessarily\ninto his harem. But if it should be his, why would you care? Your\nmen divide their love--\"\n\n\"I would care because Tako may give up his harem,\" Tolla interrupted\nvehemently. \"He goes into this conquest for power--for wealth--because\nsoon he expects to rule all our world and band it together into a\nnation. He has always told me that I might be his only wife--some\nday--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe checked herself abruptly and fell into a stolid silence. It made\nJane realize that under the lash of emotion Tolla would talk freely.\nBut Jane could create no further opportunity then, for Tako suddenly\nappeared at their door. The girls had been together now some hours.\nDon and I were at this time asleep.\n\nHe stood now at the girl's door. \"Tolla, will you go outside a\nmoment? I want to talk to this prisoner alone.\" And, interpreting\nthe look which both girls flung at him, he added, \"The door remains\nopen. If she wants you back, Tolla, she will call.\"\n\nWithout a word Tolla left the compartment. But Jane saw on her face\nagain a flood of jealousy.\n\nTako seated himself amiably. \"She has made you comfortable?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I am glad.\"\n\nHe passed a moment of silence. \"Have you been interested in the\nscene outside the window?\" he added.\n\n\"Yes. Very.\"\n\n\"A strange sight. It must seem very strange to you. This traveling\nthrough my world--\"\n\n\"Did you come to tell me that?\" she interrupted.\n\nHe smiled. \"I came for nothing in particular. Let us say I came to\nget acquainted with you. My little prisoner--you do not like me, do\nyou?\"\n\nShe tried to meet his gaze calmly. This was the first time Jane had\nhad opportunity to regard Tako closely. She saw now the aspect of\npower which was upon him. His gigantic stature was not clumsy, for\nthere was a lean, lithe grace in his movements. His face was\nhandsome in a strange foreign fashion. He was smiling now; but in\nthe set of his jaw, his wide mouth, there was an undeniable cruelty,\na ruthless dominance of purpose. And suddenly she saw the\nanimal-like aspect of him; a thinking, reasoning, but ruthless,\nanimal.\n\n\"You do not like me, do you?\" he repeated.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe forced herself to reply calmly, \"Why should I? You abduct my\nfriends. There is a girl named Eunice Arton whom you have stolen.\nWhere is she?\"[7]\n\n    [7] Neither Eunice Arton, nor any of the stolen girls, have\n    ever been heard from since. Like the thousands of men, women\n    and children who met their death in the attack upon New\n    York, Eunice Arton was a victim of these tragic events.\n\nHe shrugged. \"You could call that the fortunes of war. This is\nwar--\"\n\n\"And you,\" she said, \"are my enemy.\"\n\n\"Oh, I would not go so far as to say that. Rather would I call\nmyself your friend.\"\n\n\"So that you will return me safely? And also Bob Rivers, and my\ncousin, Don--you will return us safely as you promised?\"\n\n\"Did I promise? Are you not prompting words from my lips?\"\n\nJane was breathless from fear, but she tried not to show it.\n\n\"What are you going to do with us?\" she demanded. There is no woman\nwho lacks feminine guile in dealing with a man; and in spite of her\nterror Jane summoned it to her aid.\n\n\"You want me to like you, Tako?\"\n\n\"Of course I do. You interest me strangely. Your beauty--your\ncourage--\"\n\n\"Then if you would be sincere with me--\"\n\n\"I am; most certainly I am.\"\n\n\"You are not. You have plans for me. I told Tolla I supposed I was\ndestined for someone's harem. Yours?\"\n\nIt startled him. \"Why--\" He recovered himself and laughed. \"You\nspeak with directness.\" He suddenly turned solemn. He bent toward\nher and lowered his voice; his hand would have touched her arm, but\nshe drew away.\n\n\"In very truth, ideas are coming to me, Jane. I will be, some day\nsoon, the greatest man of my world. Does that attract you?\"\n\n\"N-no,\" she said, stammering.\n\n\"I wish that it would,\" he said earnestly. \"I do of reality wish\nthat it would. I will speak plainly, and it is in a way that Tako\nnever spoke to woman before. I have found myself, these last hours,\ncaring very much for your good opinion of me. That is surprising.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe stared at him with sudden fascination mingled with her fear. He\nseemed for this moment wholly earnest and sincere. An attractive\nsort of villain, this handsome giant, turned suddenly boyish and\nnaive.\n\n\"That is surprising,\" Tako repeated.\n\n\"Is it?\"\n\n\"Very. That I should care what any woman thinks of me, particularly\na captive girl--but I do. And I realize, Jane, that our marriage\nsystem is very different from yours. Repugnant to you, perhaps. Is\nit?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she murmured. His gaze held her; she tried to shake it off,\nbut it held her.\n\n\"Then I will tell you this: I have always felt that the glittering\nluxury of a large harem is in truth a very empty measure of man's\ngreatness. For Tako there will be more manly things. The power of\nleadership--the power to rule my world. When I got that idea, it\noccurred to me also that for a man like me there might be some one\nwoman--to stand alone by my side and rule our world.\"\n\nHis hand touched her arm, and though she shuddered, she left it\nthere. Tako added with a soft vibrant tenseness. \"I am beginning to\nthink that you are that woman.\"\n\nThere was a sound in the corridor outside the door--enough to cause\nTako momentarily to swing his gaze. It broke the spell for Jane;\nwith a shock she realized that like a snake he had been holding her\nfascinated. His gaze came back at once, but now she shook off his\nhand from her arm.\n\n\"Tolla told me you--you said something like that to her,\" Jane said\nwith an ironic smile.\n\nIt angered him. The earnestness dropped from him like a mask. \"Oh,\ndid she? And you have been mocking me, you two girls?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe stood up, his giant length bringing his head almost to the\nvaulted ceiling of the little compartment. \"What degradation for\nTako that women should discuss his heart.\"\n\nHis frowning face gazed down at Jane; there was on it now nothing to\nfascinate her; instead, his gaze inspired terror.\n\n\"We--we said nothing else,\" she stammered.\n\n\"Say what you like. What is it to me? I am a man, and the clatter of\nwomen's tongues is no concern of mine.\"\n\nHe strode to the door. From over his shoulder he said, \"What I shall\ndo with you I have not yet decided. If Tolla is interested, tell her\nthat.\"\n\n\"Tako, let me--I mean you do not understand--\"\n\nBut he was gone. Jane sat trembling. A sense of defeat was on her.\nWorse than that, she felt that she had done us all immeasurable\nharm. Tako's anger might react upon Don and me. As a matter of fact,\nif it did he concealed it, for we saw no change in his attitude.\n\nTolla rejoined Jane within a moment. If Tako spoke to her outside\nJane did not know it. But she was at once aware that the other girl\nhad been listening; Tolla's face was white and grim. She came in,\nbusied herself silently about the room.\n\nJane turned from the window. \"You heard us, Tolla?\"\n\n\"Yes, I heard you! You with your crooked look staring at him--\"\n\n\"Why, Tolla, I did not!\"\n\n\"I saw you! Staring at him so that he would think you beautiful!\nAsking him, with a boldness beyond that of any woman I could ever\nimagine--asking him if he planned you for his harem!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe stood over Jane, staring down with blazing eyes. \"Oh, I heard\nyou! And I heard him telling you how noble are his motives! One\nwoman, just for him!\"\n\n\"But, Tolla--\"\n\n\"Do not lie to me! I heard him sneering at me--telling you of this\none woman just for him! And you are that woman! Hah! He thinks that\nnow, does he? He thinks he will make you love him as I love him. As\nI love him! And what does he know of that! What woman's love can\nmean!\"\n\n\"Tolla! Don't be foolish. I didn't--I never had any desire to--\"\n\n\"What do your desires concern me? He thinks he will win you with\ntales of his conquests! A great man, this Tako, because he will\ndevastate New York!\"\n\nThis was the fury of a woman scorned. She was wholly beside herself,\nher words tumbling, incoherent, beyond her will, beyond her\nrealization of what she was saying.\n\n\"A great conquest to make you love him! With his giant projector he\nwill subdue New York! Hah! What a triumph! But it is the weapon's\npower, not his! He and all his army--these great brave and warlike\nmen--why I alone with that weapon could turn--\"\n\nShe stopped abruptly. The red flush of frenzied anger drained from\nher cheeks.\n\nJane leaped to her feet. \"What do you mean? With that giant\nprojector--\"\n\nBut Tolla was standing frozen, with all her anger gone and horror at\nwhat she had said flooding her.\n\n\"What do you mean, Tolla?\" insisted Jane, seizing her. \"What could\nyou do with that giant projector?\"\n\n\"Let me go!\" Tolla tried to jerk away.\n\n\"I won't let you go! Tell me what you were going to say!\"\n\n\"Let me go!\" Tolla got one hand loose and struck Jane in the face.\nBut Jane again seized the wrist. In the scuffle they overturned a\nchair.\n\n\"I won't let you go until you--\"\n\nAnd then Tako, Don and I, hearing the uproar, burst in upon them.\nJane let go her hold, and Tolla broke into sobs, and sank to the\nfloor.\n\nAnd both of them were sullen and silent under our questioning.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n_Weird Battleground!_\n\n\n\"We have it going very well,\" said Tako, chuckling. \"Don't you think\nso? Sit here by me. We will stay here for a time now.\"\n\nTako had a small flat rock for a table. On it he had spread his\nparaphernalia for this battle--if battle it could be called. Weird\ncontest! Opposing forces, each imponderable to the other so that no\nphysical contact had yet been made. Tako sat at his rock; giving\norders to his leaders who came hurrying up and were away at his\ncommand; or speaking orders into his sound apparatus; or consulting\nhis charts and co-ordinates, questioning Don and me at times over\nthe meaning of shadowy things we could see taking place about us.\n\nA little field headquarters our post here might have been termed.[8]\n\n    [8] The detailed nature of the scientific devices Tako used\n    in the handling of his army during the attack never has been\n    disclosed. I saw him using one of the eye-telescopes. There\n    was also a telephonic device and occasionally he would\n    discharge a silent signal radiance--a curious intermittent\n    green flare of light. His charts of the topography of New\n    York City were to me incomprehensible\n    hieroglyphics--mathematical formula, no doubt; the\n    co-ordinates of altitudes and contours of our world-space in\n    its relation to the mountainous terrain of his world which\n    stood mingled here with the New York City buildings.\n\nWe were grouped now around Tako on a small level ledge of rock. It\nlay on a broken, steeply ascending ramp of a mountainside. The\nmountain terraces towered back and above us. In front, two hundred\nfeet down, was a valley of pits and craters; and to the sides a\ntumbled region of alternating precipitous cliffs and valley depths.\n\nUpon every point of vantage, for two or three miles around us,\nTako's men were dispersed. To us, they were solid gray blobs in the\nluminous darkness. The carriers, all arrived now, stood about a mile\nfrom us, and save for their guards, the men had all left them. The\nweapons were being taken out and carried to various points over the\nmountains and in the valley depths. Small groups of men--some two\nhundred in a group--were gathered at many different points,\nassembling their weapons, and waiting for Tako's orders. Messengers\ntoiled on foot between them, climbing, white figures. Signals\nflashed.\n\nFantastic, barbaric scene--it seemed hardly modern. Mountain defiles\nwere swarming with white invaders, making ready, but not yet\nattacking.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe had had as yet no opportunity of talking alone with Jane since we\nleft the carrier. The incident with Tolla was to us wholly\ninexplicable. But that it was significant of something, we knew--by\nJane's tense white face and the furtive glances she gave us. Don and\nI were ready to seize the first opportunity to question her.\n\nTolla, by the command of Tako, stayed close by Jane, and the two\ngirls were always within sight of us. They were here now, seated on\nthe rocks twenty feet from us. And the two guards, whom Tako had\nappointed at the carrier, sat near us with alert weapons, watching\nJane and us closely.[9]\n\n    [9] There was a thing which puzzled me before we arrived in\n    the carrier, and surprised me when we left it; and though I\n    did not, and still do not wholly understand it, I think I\n    should mention it here. Traveling in the carrier we were\n    suspended in a condition of matter which might be termed mid\n    way between Tako's realm and our Earth-world. Both, in\n    shadowy form, were visible to us; and to an observer on\n    either world we also were visible.\n\n    Then, as the carrier landed, it receded from this sort of\n    borderland as I have termed it, contacted with its own realm\n    and landed. At once I saw that the shadowy outlines of New\n    York were gone. And, to New York observers, the carriers as\n    they landed, were invisible. The mountains--all this tumbled\n    barren wilderness of Tako's world--were invisible to\n    observers in New York.\n\n    But I knew now how very close were the two worlds--a very\n    fraction of visible \"distance,\" one from the other.\n\n    Then, with wires, disks and helmets--all the transition\n    mechanism worn now by us and all of Tako's forces--we drew\n    ourselves a very small fraction of the way toward the\n    Earth-world state. Enough and no more than to bring it to\n    most tenuous, most wraithlike visibility, so that we could\n    see the shadows of it and know our location in relation to\n    it, which was necessary to Tako's operations.\n\n    In this state, New York City was a wraith to us--and we were\n    shadowy, dimly visible apparitions to New York observers.\n    But in this slight transition, we did not wholly disconnect\n    with the terrain of Tako's world. There was undoubtedly--if\n    the term could be called scientific--a depth of field to the\n    solidity of these mountains. By that I mean, their\n    tangibility persisted for a certain distance toward other\n    dimensions. Perhaps it was a greater \"depth of field\" than\n    the solidity of our world possesses. As to that, I do not\n    know.\n\n    But I do know, since I experienced it, that as we sat now\n    encamped upon this ledge, the ground under us felt only a\n    trifle different from when we had full contact with it.\n    There was a lightness upon us--an abnormal feeling of\n    weight-loss--a feeling of indefinable abnormality to the\n    rocks. Yet, to observers in New York, we were faintly to be\n    seen, and the rocks upon which we sat were not.\n\nThere was just once after we left the carrier, toiling over the\nrocks with Tako's little cortege to this vantage point on the ledge,\nthat Jane found an opportunity of communicating secretly with us.\n\n\"Tolla told me something about the giant projector! Something about\nhow it--\"\n\nShe could say almost nothing but that. \"The projector, Bob, if you\ncan only learn how it--\"\n\nTolla was upon us, calling to attract Tako's attention, and Jane\nmoved away.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe giant projector! We had it with us now; a dozen men had\nlaboriously carried it up here. Not yet assembled, it stood here on\nthe ledge--a rectangular gray box about the size and shape of a\ncoffin, encased now in the mesh of transition mechanism. Tako\nintended to materialize us and that box into the city when the time\ncame, unpack and erect the projector, and with its long range\ndominate all the surrounding country.\n\nTolla had almost told Jane something about it! Jane was trying to\nlearn that secret. Or she thought we might learn it from Tako. But\nof what use if we did? We were helpless, every moment under the eyes\nof guards whose little hand-beams could in a second annihilate us.\nWhen, leaving the carrier, Jane had appeared garbed like the rest of\nus and we had all been equipped with the transition mechanism which\nwe knew well how to use now, the thought came to me of trying to\nescape. But it was futile. I could set the switches at my belt to\nmaterialize me into New York. But as I faded, the weapons of the\nguards would have been quick enough to catch me. How could Jane, Don\nand I simultaneously try a thing like that.\n\n\"Impossible!\" Don whispered. \"Don't do anything wrong. Some chance\nmay come, later.\"\n\nBut with that slight transition over, Tako at once removed from our\nbelts a vital part of the mechanism in order to make it impotent.\n\nAn hour passed, here on the ledge, with most of the activity of\nTako's men incomprehensible to us.\n\n\"You shall see very soon,\" he chuckled grimly, \"I can give the\nsignal to attack--all at once. Look there! They grow very bold,\nthese New York soldiers. They have come to inspect us.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was night in New York City--about two A.M. of the night of May\n19th and 20th. Our mountain ledge was within a store on the east\nside of Fifth Avenue at 36th Street. We seemed to be but one story\nabove the pavement. The shadowy outlines of a large rectangular room\nwith great lines of show-cases dividing it into wide aisles. I\nrecognized it at once--a jewelry store, one of the best known in the\nworld. A gigantic fortune in jewelry was here, some of it hastily\npacked in great steel safes nearby, and some of it abandoned in\nthese show-cases when the panic swept the city a few days\npreviously.\n\nBut the jewelry of our world was nothing to these White Invaders.\nTako never even glanced at the cases, or knew or cared what sort of\na store this was.\n\nThe shadowy street of Fifth Avenue showed just below us. It was\nempty now of vehicles and people, but along it a line of soldiers\nwere gathered. Other stores and ghostly structures lay along Fifth\nAvenue. And five hundred feet away, diagonally across the avenue,\nthe great Empire State Building, the tallest structure in the entire\nworld, towered like a ghostly Titan into the void above us.\n\nThis ghostly city! We could see few details. The people had all\ndeserted this mid-Manhattan now. The stores and hotels and office\nbuildings were empty.\n\nA group of soldiers came into the jewelry store and stood within a\nfew feet of us, peering at us. Yet so great was the void between us\nthat Tako barely glanced at them. He was giving orders constantly\nnow. For miles around us his men on the mountains and in the valleys\nwere feverishly active.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut doing what? Don and I could only wonder. A tenseness had gripped\nupon Tako. The time for his attack was nearing.\n\n\"Very presently now,\" he repeated. He gestured toward the great\napparition of the Empire State Building so near us.\n\n\"I am sparing that. A good place for us to mount the projector--up\nthere in that tall tower. You see where our mountain slope cuts\nthrough that building? We can materialize with the projector at that\npoint.\"\n\nThe steep ramp of the mountainside upon which we were perched sloped\nup and cut midway through the Empire State Building. The building's\nupper portion was free of the mountain whose peaks towered to the\nwest. We could climb from our ledge up the ramp to the small area\nwhere it intersected the Empire State at the building's sixtieth to\nseventieth stories.\n\nThe apparitions of New York's soldiers stood in the jewelry store\nwith futile leveled weapons.\n\n\"They are wondering what we are doing!\" Tako chuckled.\n\nA dozen of Tako's men, unheeding the apparitions, were now busy\nwithin a few hundred feet of us down the rocky slope. We saw at\nclose view, what Tako's army was busy doing everywhere. The men had\nlittle wedge-shaped objects of a gray material. The materialization\nbombs! They were placing them carefully at selected points on the\nrocks, and adjusting the firing mechanisms. This group near us,\nwhich Don and I watched with a fascinated horror, were down in the\nbasement of the jewelry store, among its foundations. There for a\nmoment; then moving out under Fifth Avenue, peering carefully at the\nspectral outlines of the cellars of other structures.\n\nThen presently Tako called an order. He stood for a moment on the\nledge with arms outstretched so that his men, and Don and I and\nJane, and the wondering apparitions of the gathered soldiers and New\nYork Police could see him. His moment of triumph! It marked his face\nwith an expression which was utterly Satanic.\n\nThen he dropped his arms for the signal to attack.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n_The Devastation of New York_\n\n\nThat night of May 19th and 20th in New York City will go down in\nhistory as the strangest, most terrible ever recorded. The panics\ncaused by the gathering apparitions of the previous days were nearly\nover now. The city was under martial law, most of it deserted by\ncivilians, save for the dead who still lay strewn on the streets.\n\nLower and mid-Manhattan were an empty shell of deserted structures,\nand silent, littered streets, which at night were dark, and through\nwhich criminals prowled, braving the unknown terror to fatten upon\nthis opportunity.\n\nSoldiers and police patrolled as best they could all of Manhattan,\ntrying to clear the streets of the crushed and trampled bodies;\nseeking in the deserted buildings those who might still be there,\ntrapped or ill, or hurt so that they could not escape; protecting\nproperty from the criminals who en masse had broken jail and were\nlurking here.\n\nWarships lay in the harbor and the rivers. The forts on Staten\nIsland and at Sandy Hook were ready with their artillery to attack\nanything tangible. Airplanes sped back and forth overhead. Troops\nwere marching from outlying points--lines of them coming in over all\nthe bridges.\n\nBy midnight of May 19th and 20th there were groups of ghosts visible\neverywhere about the city. They lurked in the buildings, permeating\nthe solid walls, stalking through them, or down through the\nfoundations; they wandered upon invisible slopes of their own world,\nclimbing up to gather in groups and hanging in mid-air over the city\nrooftops. In the Hudson River off Grant's Tomb two or three hundred\nof the apparitions were seemingly encamped at a level below the\nriver's surface. And others were in the air over the waters of the\nupper bay.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nToward midnight, from the open ocean beyond Sandy Hook spectral\nvehicles came winging for the city. Rapidly decreasing what had at\nfirst seemed a swift flight, they floated like ghostly dirigibles\nover the bay, heading for Manhattan. The forts fired upon them;\nairplanes darted at them, through them. But the wraiths came on\nunheeding. And then, gathering over Manhattan at about Washington\nSquare, they faded and vanished.\n\nWithin thirty minutes, though the vehicles never reappeared, it was\nseen that the spectral invaders were now tremendously augmented in\nnumbers. A line of shapes marched diagonally beneath the city\nstreets. Patrolling soldiers in the now deserted subways saw them\nmarching past. The group in the air over the harbor was augmented.\nIn Harlem they were very near the street levels, a mass of a\nthousand or more strung over an area of forty blocks.\n\nIn mid-Manhattan soldiers saw that Tiffany's jewelry store housed\nthe lurking shapes. Some were lower, others higher; in this section\naround Fifth Avenue and Thirty-fourth Street the apparitions were at\ntremendously diverse levels. There were some perched high in the air\nmore than half way up the gigantic Empire State Building; and still\nothers off to the west were in the air fifteen hundred feet or more\nabove the Pennsylvania Station.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt Tiffany's--as indeed in many other places--the soldiers made\nclose visual contact with the apparitions. A patrolling group of\nsoldiers entered Tiffany's and went to the second floor. They\nreported a seated group of \"ghosts,\" with numbers of white shapes\nworking near them at a lower level which brought them into Tiffany's\nbasement.\n\nThe soldiers thought that what was seated here might be a leader.\nApparitions rushed up to him, and away. And here the soldiers saw\nwhat seemed the wraiths of two girls, seated quietly together,\nhelmeted and garbed like the men. And men seemed watching them.\n\nBy one-thirty there was great activity, constant movement of the\napparitions everywhere. Doing what? No one could say. The attack, so\nclosely impending now, was presaged by nothing which could be\nunderstood.\n\nThere was one soldier who at about one-thirty A.M. was watching the\nspectres which lurked seemingly in the foundations of Tiffany's. He\nwas called to distant Westchester where the harried Army officials\nhad their temporary headquarters this night. He sped there on his\nmotorcycle and so by chance he was left alive to tell what he had\nseen. The wraiths under Tiffany's were placing little wedge-shaped\nghostly bricks very carefully at different points. It occurred to\nthis soldier that they were putting them in spaces coincidental with\nthe building's foundations.\n\nAnd then came the attack. The materialization bombs--as we knew them\nto be--were fired. Progressively over a few minutes, at a thousand\ndifferent points. The area seemed to be from the Battery to\nSeventy-second Street. Observers in circling airplanes saw it\nbest--there were few others left alive to tell of it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe whole thing lasted ten minutes. Perhaps it was not even so long.\nIt began at Washington Square. The little ghostly wedges which had\nbeen placed within the bricks of the arch at the foot of Fifth\nAvenue began materializing; turning solid. From imponderability they\ngrew tangible; demanded free empty space of their own. Wedged and\npushed with solidifying molecules and atoms, each demanding its\nlittle space and finding none. Encountering other solidity.\n\nOutraged nature! No two material bodies can occupy the same space at\nthe same time!\n\nThe Washington Arch very queerly seemed to burst apart by a\nstrangely silent explosion. The upper portion toppled and fell with\na clatter of masonry littering the avenue and park.\n\nThen a house nearby went down; then another. Everything seemed to be\ncrumbling, falling. That was the beginning. Within a minute the\nchaos spread, running over the city like fire on strewn gasoline.\nBuildings everywhere came crashing down. The street heaved up,\ncracking apart in long jagged lines of opening rifts as though an\nearthquake were splitting them. The subways and tubes and tunnels\nyawned like black fantastic chasms crossed and littered by broken\ngirders.\n\nThe river waters heaved with waves lashed white as the great bridges\nfell into them; and sucked down and closed again with tumultuous\nwhirlpools where the water had rushed into the cracked tunnels of\nthe river bed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOf the towering skyscrapers the Woolworth was the first to crumble;\nit split into sections as it fell across the wreckage which already\nlittered City Hall. Then the Bank of Manhattan Building, crumbling,\npartly falling sidewise, partly slumping upon the ruins of itself.\nSimultaneously the Chrysler Building toppled. For a second or two it\nseemed perilously to sway. Breathless, awesome seconds. It swayed\nover, lurched back like a great tree in a wind. Then very slowly it\nswayed again and did not come back. Falling to the east, its whole\ngiant length came down in a great arc. The descent grew faster,\nuntil, in one great swoop it crashed upon the wreckage of the Grand\nCentral Station. The roar of it surged over the city. The crash of\nmasonry; the clatter of its myriad windows, the din of its rending,\nbreaking girders.\n\nThe giant buildings were everywhere tumbling like falling giants;\nlike Titans stricken by invisible tumors implanted in their vitals.\nIt lasted ten minutes. What infinitude of horror came to proud and\nlordly Manhattan Island in those momentous ten minutes!\n\nTen thousand patrolling soldiers and police, bands of lurking\ncriminals, and men, women and children who still had not left the\ncity, went down to death in those ten minutes. Yet no observer could\nhave seen them. Their little bodies, so small amid these Titans of\ntheir own creation, went into oblivion unnoticed in the chaos.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe little solidifying bombs of the White Invaders did their work\nsilently. But what a roar surged up into the moonlit night from the\nstricken city! What tumult of mingled sounds! What a myriad of\nsplintering, reverberating crashes, bursting upward into the night;\nechoing away, renewed again and again so that it all was a vast\npulsing throb of terrible sound. And under it, inaudible, what faint\nlittle sounds must have been the agonized screams of the humans who\nwere entombed!\n\nThen the pulse of the great roaring sound began slowing. Soon it\nbecame a dying roar. A last building was toppling here and there.\nThe silence of death was spreading over the mangled litter of the\nstrewn city. Dying chaos of sound; but now it was a chaos of color.\nUp-rolling clouds of plaster dust; and then darker, heavier clouds\nof smoke. Lurid yellow spots showed through the smoke clouds where\neverywhere fires were breaking up.\n\nAnd under it, within it all, the vague white shapes of the enemy\napparitions stood untouched, still peering curious, awed triumphant\nat what they had done.\n\nAnother ten minutes passed; then half an hour, perhaps. The\napparitions were moving now. The many little groups were gathering\ninto fewer, larger groups. One marched high in the air, with faint\nlurid green beams slanting down at the ruins of the city; not as\nweapons this time, but as beams of faint light, seemingly to\nilluminate the scene, or perhaps as signals to the ghostly army.\n\nThe warships in the Hudson were steaming slowly toward the Battery\nto escape. Searchlights from them, from the other ships hovering\nimpotent in the bay, and from a group of encircling planes, flashed\ntheir white beams over the night to mingle with the glare of the\nfires and the black pall of smoke which was spreading now like a\nshroud.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere were two young men in a monoplane which had helplessly circled\nover mid-Manhattan. They saw the city fall, and noticed the lurking\nwraiths untouched amid the ruins and in the air overhead. And they\nsaw, when it was over, that one great building very strangely had\nescaped. The Empire State, rearing its tower high into the serene\nmoonlight above the wreckage and the rising layers of smoke, stood\nunscathed in the very heart of Manhattan. The lone survivor,\nstanding there with the moonlight shining upon its top, and the\nsmoke gathering black around its spreading base.\n\nThe two observers in the airplane, stricken with horror at what they\nhad seen, flew mechanically back and forth. Once they passed within\na few hundred feet of the standing giant. They saw its two hundred\nfoot mooring mast for dirigibles rising above the eighty-five\nstories of the main structure. They saw the little observatory room\nup there in the mooring mast top, with its circular observation\nplatform, a balcony around it. But they did not notice the figures\non that balcony.\n\nThen, from the top of the Empire State Building--from the circular\nobservation platform--a single, horribly intense green light-beam\nslanted out into the night! A new attack! As though all which had\ngone before were not enough destruction, now came a new assault. The\nspectral enemies were tangible now!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe single green light-beam was very narrow. But the moonlight could\nnot fade it; over miles of distance it held visible. It struck first\na passing airplane. The two observers in the monoplane were at this\ntime down near the Battery. They saw the giant beam hit the\nairplane. A moment it clung, and parts of the plane faded. The plane\nwavered, and then, like a plummet, fell.\n\nThe beam swung. It struck a warship lying in the upper bay.\nExplosions sounded. Puffs of light flared. The ship, with all its\npassengers vanished and gone, lay gutted and empty.\n\nThe source of the light moved rapidly around the circular balcony.\nThe light darted to every distant point of the compass. The\nsurprised distant ships and forts, realizing that here for the first\ntime was a tangible assailant, screamed shots into the night. But\nthe green beam struck the ships and forts and instantly silenced\nthem.\n\nNow the realization of this tangible enemy spread very far. Within a\nfew minutes, planes and radio communication had carried the news.\nFrom distant points which the light could not or did not reach,\nlong-range guns were firing at the Empire State. A moment or two\nonly. The base of the building was struck.\n\nThen, frantically, observing planes sent out the warning to stop\nfiring. The green beam had for a minute or two vanished. But now it\nflashed on again. What was this? The spectral wraiths of ten\nthousand of the enemy were staring. The observers in the planes\nstared and gasped. What fantasy! What new weird sight was this,\nstranger than all that had preceded it!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n_On the Tower Balcony_\n\n\nUpon the little observatory balcony at the top of the Empire State\nsome twelve hundred feet above the stricken city, Don and I were\nwith Tako as he erected the giant projector. In the midst of the\nsilent shadowy outline of the stricken city falling around us, we\nhad carried the projector up the mountain slope. The spectre of the\nEmpire State Building was presently around us; we were in a hallway\nof one of the upper stories. Slowly, we materialized with our\nburden. I recall, as the dark empty corridor of the office building\ncame to solidity around me, with what surprise I heard for the first\ntime the muffled reverberations from the crumbling city....\n\nWe climbed the dark and empty stairs, upward into the mooring mast.\nDon and I toiled with the box, under the weapons of our two guards.\n\nIt was only a few minutes while Tako assembled and mounted the\nweapon. It stood a trifle higher than the parapet top. It rolled\nfreely upon a little carriage mounted with wheels. Don and I peered\nat it. We hovered close to Tako with only one thought in our minds,\nJane's murmured words--if we could learn something about this\nprojector....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen the horror dulled us. We obeyed orders mechanically, as though\nall of it were a terrible dream, with only a vague undercurrent of\nreiterated thought: some chance must come--some fated little chance\ncoming our way.\n\nI recall, during those last terrible minutes when Tako flung the\nprojector beam to send all his distant enemies hurtling into\nannihilation, that I stood in a daze by the parapet. Don had ceased\nto look. Tako was rolling the projector from one point to another\naround the circular balcony. Sometimes he was out of sight on the\nother side, with the observatory room in the mast hiding him.\n\nWe had been ordered not to move. The two guards stood with hand\nweapons turned on so that the faint green beams slanted downward by\ntheir feet, instantly ready, either for Don or me.\n\nAnd I clung to the balcony rail, staring down at the broken city. It\nlay strewn and flattened as though, not ten minutes, but ten\nthousand years of time had crumbled it into ruins.\n\nThen shots from the distant warships began screaming at us. With a\ngrim smile, Tako silenced them. There was a momentary lull.\n\nAnd then came our chance! Fate, bringing just one unforeseen little\nthing to link the chain, to turn the undercurrent of existing\ncircumstances--and to give us our chance. Or perhaps Jane, guided by\nfate, created the opportunity. She does not know. She too was dazed,\nnumb--but there was within her also the memory of what Tolla had\nalmost said. And Tolla's frenzy of jealousy....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTako appeared from around the balcony, rolling the projector. Its\nbeam was off. He flung a glance of warning at the two guards to\nwatch us. He left the projector, flushed, triumphant, all his senses\nperhaps reeling with the realization of what he had done. He saw the\ntwo girls huddled in the moonlight of the balcony floor. He stooped\nand pushed Tolla roughly away.\n\n\"Jane! Jane, did you see it? My triumph! Tako, master of everything!\nEven of you--is it not so?\"\n\nDid some instinct impel her not to repulse him? Some intuition\ngiving her strength to flash him a single alluring moonlit glance?\n\nBut suddenly he had enwrapped her in his arms. Kissing her,\nmurmuring love and lust....\n\nThis was our chance. But we did not know it then. A very chaos of\ndiverse action so suddenly was precipitated upon this balcony!\n\nDon and I cried out and heedlessly leaped forward. The tiny beams of\nthe guards swung up. But they did not reach us, for the guards\nthemselves were stricken into horror. The shot from a far-distant\nwarship screamed past. But that went almost unheeded. Tako had\nshouted, and the guards impulsively turned so that their beams\nmissed Don and me.\n\nTolla had flung herself upon Tako and Jane. Screaming, she tore at\nthem and all in an instant rose to her feet. Tako's cylinder, which\nshe had snatched, was in her hand. She flashed it on as Don and I\nreached her.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe guards for that instant could not fire for we were all\nintermingled. Don stumbled in his rush and fell upon Tako and Jane,\nand in a moment rose as the giant Tako lifted him and tried to cast\nhim off.\n\nMy rush flung me against Tolla. She was babbling, mouthing frenzied\nlaughs of hysteria. Her beam pointed downward, but as she reeled\nfrom the impact of my rush, the beam swung up; missed me, narrowly\nmissed the swaying bodies of Tako and Don, and struck one of the\nguards who was standing, undecided what to do. It clung to him for a\nsecond or two, and then swung to the other guard.\n\nThe guards in a puff of spectral light were gone. Tolla stood\nwavering; then swung her light toward Tako and Don. But I was upon\nher.\n\n\"Tolla! Good God--\"\n\n\"Get back from me! Back, I tell you.\"\n\nI heard Jane's agonized warning from the floor. \"Bob!\"\n\nTolla's light missed my shoulder. Tako had cast Don off and stood\nalone as he turned toward us. Then Tolla's light-beam swung on him.\nI heard her eery maddened laugh as it struck him.\n\nA wraith of Tako was there, stricken as though numbed by\nsurprise.... Then nothingness....\n\nShots from the distant warships were screaming around us. One struck\nthe base of the building.\n\nI clung to my scattering senses. I gripped Tolla.\n\n\"That projector--what was it you almost told Jane?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe stood stupidly babbling. \"Told Jane? That projector--\"\n\nShe laughed wildly, and like a tigress, cast me off. \"Fools of men!\nTako--the fool!\"\n\nShe swung into a frenzy of her own language. And then back into\nEnglish. \"I will show you--Tako, the fool! All those fools out there\nunder the ground and in the sky. I will show them!\"\n\nShe stooped over the projector and fumbled with the mechanism.\n\nDon gasped, \"Those apparitions--is that what you're going to\nattack?\"\n\n\"Yes--attack them!\"\n\nThe beam flashed on. But it was a different beam now. Fainter, more\ntenuous; the hum from it was different.\n\nIt leaped into the ground. It was a spreading beam this time. It\nbathed the white apparitions who were peering up at the city.\n\nWhy, what was this? Weird, fantastic sight! There was a moment of\nTolla's frenzied madness; then she staggered away from the\nprojector. But Don and I had caught the secret. We took her place.\nWe carried it on.\n\nWe were hardly aware that the far-off warships had ceased firing. We\nhardly realized that Tolla had rushed for the parapet; climbed,\nscreaming and laughing--and that Jane tried to stop her.\n\n\"Oh, Tolla, don't--\"\n\nBut Tolla toppled and fell.... Her body was almost not recognized\nwhen it was later found down in the ruins.\n\nDon and I flung this new beam into the night. We rolled the\nprojector around the platform, hurling the beam in every direction\nat the white apparitions....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt had caught first that group which lurked in the ground near the\nbase of the Empire State. Tolla had turned the beam to the reverse\nco-ordinates from those Tako used. It penetrated into the\nborderland, reached the apparitions and forcibly materialized them!\nA second or two it clung to that group of white men's shapes in the\nground. They grew solid; ponderable. But the space they now claimed\nwas not empty! Solid rock was here, yielding no space to anything!\nLike the little materialization bombs, this was nature outraged. The\nground and the solid rock heaved up, broken and torn, invisibly\npermeated and strewn with the infinitesimal atomic particles of what\na moment before had been the bodies of living men.\n\nWe caught with the beam that marching line of apparitions beneath\nthe ground surface--a section of Tako's army which was advancing\nupon Westchester. The city streets over them surged upward. And some\nwe caught under the rivers and within the waters of the bay, and the\nwaters heaved and lashed into turmoil.\n\nThen we turned the beam into the air. The apparitions lost contact\nwith their invisible mountain peaks. And with sudden solidity, the\ngravity of our world pulled at them. They fell. Solid men's bodies,\nfalling with the moonlight on them. Dark blobs turning end over end;\nplunging into the rivers and the harbor with little splashes of\nwhite to mark their fall; and yet others whirling down, crashing\ninto the wreckage of masonry, into the pall of smoke and the lurid\nyellow flames of the burning city.\n\nThe attack of the White Invaders was over.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA year has passed. There has been no further menace; perhaps there\nnever will be. And again, the invisible realm of which Don, Jane and\nI were vouchsafed so strange a glimpse, lies across a void\nimpenetrable. Earth scientists have the projector, with its current\nbatteries apparently almost exhausted. And they have the transition\nmechanism which we three were wearing. But of those, the vital\nelement had been removed by Tako--and was gone with him. Many others\nwere found on the bodies, and upon the body of poor Tolla. But all\nwere wrecked by their fall.\n\nPerhaps it is just as well. Yet, often I ponder on that other realm.\nWhat strange customs and science and civilization I glimpsed.\n\nOut of such thoughts one always looms upon me: a contemplation of\nthe vastness of things to be known.\n\nAnd the kindred thought: what a very small part of it we really\nunderstand!\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The White Invaders, by Raymond King Cummings\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE WHITE INVADERS ***\n\n***** This file should be named 20551.txt or 20551.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/0/5/5/20551/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Barbara Tozier and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
