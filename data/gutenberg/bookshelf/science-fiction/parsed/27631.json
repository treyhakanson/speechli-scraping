They died for a dangerous dream\n    that had only one chance in a thousand trillion to come true. Is\n    there a better reason for dying?_\n\n\n_... although the most recent star to die, RNAC 89778 in the distant\nMenelaus galaxy (common name, Menelaus XII), had eight inhabited\nplanets, only some one thousand people of the fifth planet escaped and\nsurvived as a result of a computer error which miscalculated the exact\ntime by two years. Due to basic psycho-philo maladjustments the refugees\nof Menelaus XII-5 are classified as anti-social-types-B-6 and must be\nconsidered unstable. All anti-social-types-B-6 are barred from\nresponsible positions in United Galaxies by order of the Inter-Galactic\nCouncil._\n\n                                  --Short History of The United Galaxies\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nYuan Saltario started it. He was serving in my Company and he was one of\nthem. A Menelaus XII-5 \"unstable,\" and don't ever call that damned\nlittle planet by its number if you meet one of them. They call it\nNova-Maurania. But you won't meet one of them. Or maybe you will, maybe\nthey did make it. I like to think they did.\n\nThere were a lot of them in the Companies in 3078. Restless men. The\nCompanies were the logical place for them. We're still classified\nanti-social-B-6, too. Every year it's harder to get recruits, but we\nstill have to be careful who we take in. We took Yuan Saltario. There\nwas something about him from the very start.\n\n\"Why do you want to join a Free Company?\" He was a short, humanoid type\nwith deep black eyes and a thin, lipless mouth that never smiled.\n\n\"I'm an anti-social. I like to fight. I want to fight.\"\n\n\"A misfit joining the misfits? A grudge against the Council? It's not\ngood enough, mister, we live on the Council. Try again.\"\n\nSaltario's black eyes stared without a flicker. \"You're Red Stone,\nCommander of the Red Company. You hate the Council and I hate the\nCouncil. You're the ...\" Saltario stopped.\n\nI said, \"The Traitor of the Glorious War of Survival. You can say it,\nSaltario.\"\n\nThe lipless mouth was rigid. \"I don't think of it that way. I think of a\nman with personal integrity,\" Saltario said.\n\nI suppose I should have seen it then, the rock he carried deep inside\nhim. It might have saved thirty thousand good men. But I was thinking of\nmyself. Commander Red Stone of the Red Company, Earthmen. Only we're not\nall Earthmen now, every year there are fewer recruits, and it won't be\nlong before we die out and the Council will have the last laugh. Old Red\nStone, the Traitor of the War of Survival, the little finger of my left\nhand still missing and telling the Universe I was a very old soldier of\nthe outlawed Free Companies hanging onto life on a rocky planet of the\ndistant Salaman galaxy. Back at the old stand because United Galaxies\nstill need us. In a way it's a big joke. Two years after Rajay-Ben and I\nhad a bellyfull of the Glorious War of Survival and they chased us all\nthe way out here, they turned right around and made the peace. A joke on\nme, but sometimes I like to think that our runout was the thing that\nmade them think and make peace. When you've been a soldier for\nthirty-five years you like to win battles, but you like to feel you\nhelped bring peace, too.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI said, \"Personal integrity. That sounds pretty good, doesn't it? So you\nlike personal integrity? All right, Saltario, are you sure you know what\nyou're getting into? We're 60 million light years from Galaxy Center, 10\nmillion from the nearest United Galaxy city. We've got no comforts, no\nfuture, nothing to do but fight. A woman in her right mind won't look at\nus, if they see you in uniform they'll spit on you, if they catch you\nout of uniform they'll kill you.\"\n\nSaltario shrugged. \"I like to eat. I've got nowhere to go. All I've got\nis myself and a big piece of ice I called home.\"\n\nI nodded. \"Okay. We fight small wars for good profits. It's not Earth\nout here, but we've got four nice suns, plenty of Lukanian whisky\nRajay-Ben taught the locals to make, and we're our own masters. The\nUnited Galaxies leaves us pretty much alone unless they need us. You do\nyour job, and your job is what I tell you to do, period. You got that\nstraight?\"\n\nSaltario very nearly smiled. \"It sounds good to me, sir.\"\n\n\"I hope it'll sound good in a year, Saltario, because once you're in you\ndon't get out except feet first. Is that clear? I have life and death\nrights over you. You owe allegiance to the Red Company and me and to no\none else. Got that? Today your best friends are the men of Rajay-Ben's\nLukanian Fourth Free Patrol, and your worst enemies are the men of\nMandasiva's Sirian O Company. Tomorrow Rajay-Ben's boys may be your\nworst enemies, and Mandasiva's troops your best friends. It all depends\non the contract. A Company on the same contract is a friend, a Company\nagainst the contract is an enemy. You'll drink with a man today, and\nkill him tomorrow. Got it? If you kill a Free Companion without a\ncontract you go to court-martial. If you kill a citizen of the United\nGalaxies except in a battle under contract I throw you to the wolves and\nthat means you're finished. That's the way it is.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" Saltario never moved a muscle. He was rigid.\n\n\"Right,\" I said, \"get your gear, see the Adjutant and sign the\nagreement. I think you'll do.\"\n\nSaltario left. I sat back in my chair and thought about how many\nnon-Earthmen I was taking into the Company. Maybe I should have been\nthinking about this one single non-Earthman and the something he was\ncarrying inside him, but I didn't, and it cost the Companies thirty\nthousand men we couldn't afford to lose. We can't afford to lose one\nman. There are only a hundred Companies now, twenty thousand men each,\ngive or take a few thousand depending on how the last contract went.\nLife is good in the United Galaxies now that they've disarmed and\noutlawed all war again, and our breed is dying out faster than it did in\nthe 500 years of peace before the War of Survival. Too many of the old\nCompanions like me went west in the War of Survival. The Galactic\nCouncil know they need us, know that you can't change all living\ncreatures into good Galactic citizens overnight, so they let us go on\nfighting for anyone in the Universe who wants to take something from\nsomeone else, or who thinks someone else wants to take something from\nhim. And even the mighty United Galaxies needs guards for expeditions to\nthe unexplored galaxies. But they don't like us and they don't want us.\nThey don't cut off our little fingers anymore, but we have to wear our\nspecial black uniforms when we go into United territory under penalty of\na quick death. Humane, of course, they just put us to sleep gently and\nfor keeps. And they've got a stockpile of ionic bombs ready at all times\nin case we get out of hand. We don't have ionic weapons, that's part of\nthe agreement and they watch us. They came close to using them down\nthere in the frozen waste of Menelaus XII, but thirty thousand of us\ndied without ionics. We killed each other. They liked that, even if they\ndidn't like what happened.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDo you know what it means to be lost? Really lost? I'm lost, if that\nmeans I know I'll never go back to live on Earth. But I know that Earth\nis still there to go back to, and I can dream of going home. Yuan\nSaltario and the other refugees have no home to go back to. They can't\neven dream. They sat in that one ship that escaped and watched their\nplanet turn into a lifeless ball of ice that would circle dead and\nfrozen forever around its burned-out star. A giant tomb that carried\nunder its thick ice their homes and their fields and their loves. And\nthey could not even hope and dream. Or I did not think they could.\n\nSaltario had been with us a year when we got the contract to escort the\nsurvey mission to Nova-Maurania. A private Earth commercial mining firm\nlooking for minerals under the frozen wastes of the dead planet.\nRajay-Ben was in on the contract. We took two battalions, one from my\nRed Company, and one from Rajay-Ben's Lukanian Patrol. My Sub-Commander\nwas Pete Colenso, old Mike Colenso's boy. It all went fine for a week or\nso, routine guard and patrol. The survey team wouldn't associate with\nus, of course, but we were used to that. We kept our eyes open and our\nmouths shut. That's our job, and we give value for money received. So we\nwere alert and ready. But it wasn't the attack that nearly got us this\ntime. It was the cold of the dead planet lost in absolute zero and\nabsolute darkness.\n\nNova-Maurania was nearly 40 percent uranium, and who could resist that?\nA Centaurian trading unit did not resist the lure. The attack was quick\nand hard. A typical Lukanian Patrol attack. My Company was pinned down\nat the first volley from those damned smoky blasters of the Lukanians.\nAll I could see was the same shimmering lights I had learned to know so\nwell in the War of Survival against Lukania. Someday maybe I'll find out\nhow to see a Lukan, Rajay-Ben has worked with me a long time to help,\nbut when the attack came this time all I could do was eat ice and beam a\nhelp call to Rajay-Ben. That Centaurian trading unit was a cheap outfit,\nthey had hired only one battalion of Arjay-Ben's Ninth Lukanian Free\nPatrol, and Rajay-Ben flanked them right off that planet. I got my boys\non their feet and we chased Arjay's men half way back to Salaman with\nRajay-Ben laughing like a hyena the whole way.\n\n\"Dip me in mud, Red boy, I'd give a prime contract for one gander at old\nArjay-Ben's face. He's blowing a gasket!\"\n\nI said, \"Nice flank job.\"\n\nRajay-Ben laughed so hard I could see his pattern of colored light\nshaking like a dancing rainbow. \"I took two Sub-Commanders, wait'll I\nhit that bullet-head for ransom!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen we stopped laughing. We had won the battle, but Arjay-Ben was a\ncrafty old soldier and his sabotage squad had wrecked our engines and\nour heating units. We were stuck on a frozen planet without heat.\n\nYoung Colenso turned white. \"What do we do?\"\n\nI said, \"Beam for help and pray we don't freeze first.\"\n\nThey had missed our small communications reactor unit. We sent out our\ncall, and we all huddled around the small reactor. There might be enough\nheat out of it to let us live five hours. If we were lucky. It was the\nthird hour when Yuan Saltario began to talk. Maybe it was the nearness\nof death.\n\n\"I was twenty-two. Portario was the leader on our planet. He found the\nerror when we had one ship ready. We had three days. No time to get the\nother ships ready. He said we were lucky, the other planets didn't have\neven one ship ready. Not even time for United Galaxies to help. Portario\nchose a thousand of us to go. I was one. At first I felt very good, you\nknow? I was really happy. Until I found out that my wife couldn't go.\nNot fit enough. United Galaxies had beamed the standards to us. Funny\nhow you don't think about other people until something hurts you. I'd\nbeen married a year. I told them it was both of us or neither of us. I\ntold Portario to tell United Galaxies they couldn't break up a family\nand to hell with their standards. They laughed at me. Not Portario, the\nCouncil. What did they care, they would just take another man. My wife\nbegged me to go. She cried so much I had to agree to go. I loved her too\nmuch to be able to stay and see the look on her face as we both died\nwhen she knew I could have gone. On the ship before we took off I stood\nat a port and looked down at her. A small girl trying to smile at me.\nShe waved once before they led her away from the rocket. All hell was\nshaking the planet already, had been for months, but all I saw was a\nsmall girl waving once, just once. She's still here, somewhere down\nthere under the ice.\"\n\nThe cold was slowly creeping into us. It was hard to move my mouth, but\nI said, \"She loved you, she wanted you to live.\"\n\n\"Without her, without my home, I'm as dead as the planet. I feel frozen.\nShe's like that dead sun out there, and I'll circle around her until\nsomeone gets me and ends it.\" Saltario seemed to be seeing something.\n\"I'm beginning to forget what she looked like. I don't want to forget! I\ncan't forget her on this planet. The way it was! It was a beautiful\nplace, perfect! I don't want to forget her!\"\n\nColenso said, \"You won't have long to remember.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut Colenso was wrong. My Third Battalion showed up when we had just\nless than an hour to live. They took us off. The Earth mining outfit\nhaggled over the contract because the job had not been finished and I\nhad to settle for two-third contract price. Rajay-Ben did better when he\nransomed Arjay-Ben's two Sub-Commanders. It wasn't a bad deal and I\nwould have been satisfied, except that something had happened to Yuan\nSaltario.\n\nMaybe it made him realize that he did not want to die after all. Or\nmaybe it turned him space-happy and he began to dream. A dream of his\nown born up there in the cold of his dead planet. A dream that nearly\ncost me my Company.\n\nI did not know what that dream was until Saltario came into my office a\nyear later. He had a job for the Company.\n\n\"How many men?\" I asked.\n\n\"Our Company and Rajay-Ben's Patrol,\" Saltario said.\n\n\"Full strength?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Price?\"\n\n\"Standard, sir,\" Saltario said. \"The party will pay.\"\n\n\"Just a trip to your old planet?\"\n\n\"That's all,\" Saltario said. \"A guard contract. The hiring party just\ndon't want any interference with their project.\"\n\n\"Two full Companies? Forty thousand men? They must expect to need a lot\nof protecting.\"\n\n\"United Galaxies opposes the project. Or they will if they get wind of\nit.\"\n\nI said, \"United opposes a lot of things, what's special about this\nscheme?\"\n\nSaltario hesitated, then looked at me with those flat black eyes.\n\"Ionics.\"\n\nIt's not a word you say, or hear, without a chill somewhere deep\ninside. Not even me and I know a man can survive ionic weapons. I know\nbecause I did once. Weapons so powerful I'm one of the last men alive\nwho saw them in action. Mathematically the big ones could wipe out a\nGalaxy. I saw a small one destroy a star in ten seconds. I watched\nSaltario for a long time. It seemed a long time, anyway. It was probably\ntwenty seconds. I was wondering if he had gone space-crazy for keeps.\nAnd I was thinking of how I could find out what it was all about in time\nto stop it.\n\nI said, \"A hundred Companies won't be enough. Saltario, have you ever\nseen or heard what an ionic bomb can ...\"\n\nSaltario said, \"Not weapons, peaceful power.\"\n\n\"Even that's out and you know it,\" I said. \"United Galaxies won't even\ntouch peaceful ionics, too dangerous to even use.\"\n\n\"You can take a look first.\"\n\n\"A good look,\" I said.\n\nI alerted Rajay-Ben and we took two squads and a small ship and Saltario\ndirected us to a tall mountain that jutted a hundred feet above the ice\nof Nova-Maurania. I was not surprised. In a way I think I knew from the\nmoment Saltario walked into my office. Whatever it was Saltario was part\nof it. And I had a pretty good idea what it was. The only question was\nhow. But I didn't have time to think it out any farther. In the\nCompanies you learn to feel danger.\n\nThe first fire caught four of my men. Then I was down on the ice. They\nwere easy to see. Black uniforms with white wedges. Pete O'Hara's White\nWedge Company, Earthmen. I don't like fighting other Earthmen, but a\njob's a job and you don't ask questions in the Companies. It looked like\na full battalion against our two squads. On the smooth ice surface there\nwas no cover except the jutting mountain top off to the right. And no\nlight in the absolute darkness of a dead star. But we could see through\nour viewers, and so could they. They outnumbered us ten to one.\nRajay-Ben's voice came through the closed circuit.\n\n\"Bad show, Red, they got our pants down!\"\n\n\"You call it,\" I answered.\n\n\"Break silence!\"\n\nSurrender. When a Company breaks silence in a battle it means surrender.\nThere was no other way. And I had a pretty good idea that the Council\nitself was behind O'Hara on this job. If it was ionics involved, they\nwouldn't ransom us. The Council had waited a long time to catch Red\nStone in an execution offense. They wouldn't miss.\n\nBut forty of our men were down already.\n\n\"Okay,\" I beamed over the circuit, \"break silence. We've had it Rajay.\"\n\n\"Council offense, Red.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWell, I'd had a lot of good years. Maybe I'd been a soldier too long. I\nwas thinking just like that when the sudden flank attack started. From\nthe right. Heavy fire from the cover of the solitary mountain top.\nO'Hara's men were dropping. I stared through my viewer. On that mountain\nI counted the uniforms of twenty-two different Companies. That was very\nwrong. Whoever Saltario was fronting for could not have the power or the\ngold to hire twenty-four Companies including mine and Rajay-Ben's. And\nthe fire was heavy but not that heavy. But whoever they were they were\nvery welcome. We had a chance now. And I was making my plans when the\ntall old man stood up on the small, jutting top of that mountain. The\ntall old man stood up and a translating machine boomed out.\n\n\"All of you! O'Hara's men! Look at this!\"\n\nI saw it. In a beam of light on the top of that mountain it looked like\na small neutron-source machine. But it wasn't. It was an ionic beam\nprojector.\n\nThe old man said, \"Go home.\"\n\nThey went. They went fast and silent. And I knew where they were going.\nNot to Salaman. O'Hara would have taken one look at that machine and be\nhalf way to United Galaxy Center before he had stopped seeing it. I felt\nlike taking that trip myself. But I had agreed to look and I would look.\nIf we were lucky we would have forty-eight hours to look and run.\n\nI fell in what was left of my Company behind the men that had saved us.\nMore Company uniforms than I had ever seen in one place. They said\nnothing. Just walked into a hole in that mountain. Into a cave. And in\nthe cave, at the far end, a door opened. An elevator. We followed the\ntall old man into the elevator and it began to descend. The elevator car\nwent down for a long time. At last I could see a faint glow far below.\nThe glow grew brighter and the car stopped. Far below the glow was still\nbrighter. We all stepped out into a long corridor cut from solid rock. I\nestimated that we were at least two hundred miles down and the glow was\nhundreds of miles deeper. We went through three sealed doors and emerged\ninto a vast room. A room bright with light and filled with more men in\nCompany uniforms, civilians, even women. At least a thousand. And I saw\nit. The thousand refugees, all of them. Gathered from all the Companies,\nfrom wherever they had been in the Galaxies. Gathered here in a room\ntwo hundred miles into the heart of their dead planet. A room filled\nwith giant machines. Ionic machines. Highly advanced ionic power\nreactors.\n\nThe old man stood in front of his people and spoke. \"I am Jason\nPortario, I thank you for coming.\"\n\nI broke in, \"Ionic power is an execution offense. You know that. How the\nhell did you get all this ...\"\n\n\"I know the offense, Commander,\" Portario said, \"and I know you. You're\na fair man. You're a brave man. It doesn't matter where we got the\npower, many men are dead to get it, but we have it, and we will keep it.\nWe have a job to do.\"\n\nI said, \"After that stunt out there you've about as much chance as a\nsnowball in hell. O'Hara's half way to Galaxy Center. Look, with a\nlittle luck we get you out to Salaman. If you leave all this equipment I\nmight be able to hide you until it blows over.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe old man shrugged. \"I would have preferred not to show our hand, but\nwe had to save you. I was aware that the Council would find us out\nsooner or later, they missed the ionic material a month ago. But that is\nunimportant. The important matter is will you take our job? All we need\nis another two days, perhaps three. Can you hold off an attack for that\nlong?\"\n\n\"Why?\" I asked.\n\nPortario smiled. \"All right, Commander, you should know all we plan. Sit\ndown, and let me finish before you speak.\"\n\nI sat. Rajay-Ben sat. The agitation of his colored lights showed that he\nwas as disturbed as I was. The thousand Nova-Mauranians stood there in\nthe room and watched us. Yuan Saltario stood with his friends. I could\nfeel his eyes on me. Hot eyes. As if something inside that lost man was\nburning again. Portario lighted a pipe. I had not seen a pipe since I\nwas a child. The habit was classified as ancient usage in the United\nGalaxies. Portario saw me staring. He held his pipe and looked at it.\n\n\"In a way, Commander,\" the old man said, \"this pipe is my story. On\nNova-Maurania we liked a pipe. We liked a lot of the old habits. Maybe\nwe should have died with all the others. You know, I was the one who\nfound the error. Sometimes I'm not at all sure my friends here thank me\nfor it. Our planet is dead, Commander, and so are we. We're dead inside.\nBut we have a dream. We want to live again. And to live again our planet\nmust live again.\" The old man paused as if trying to be sure of telling\nit right. \"We mean no harm to anyone. All we want is our life back. We\ndon't want to live forever like lumps of ice circling around a dead\nheart. What we plan may kill us all, but we feel it is worth the risk.\nWe have thousands of ionic power reactors. We have blasted out Venturi\ntubes. We found life still deep in the center of this planet. It is all\nready now. With all the power we have we will break the hold of our dead\nsun and send this planet off into space! We ...\"\n\nI said, \"You're insane! It can't ...\"\n\n\"But it can, Commander. It's a great risk, yes, but it can be done, my\ncalculations are perfect! We want to leave this dead system, go off into\nspace and find a new star that will bring life back to our planet! A\ngreen, live, warm Nova-Maurania once again!\"\n\nRajay-Ben was laughing. \"That's the craziest damned dream I ever sat\nstill for. You know what your chances of being picked up by another star\nare? Picked up just right? Why ...\"\n\nPortario said, \"We have calculated the exact initial thrust, the exact\ntangential velocity, the precise orbital path we need. If all goes\nexactly, I emphasize, _exactly_, to the last detail as we have planned\nit we can do it! Our chances of being caught by the correct star in the\nabsolutely correct position are one in a thousand trillion, but we can\ndo it!\"\n\nIt was so impossible I began to believe he was right. \"If you aren't\ncaught just right?\"\n\nPortario's black eyes watched me. \"We could burn up or stay frozen and\nlifeless. We could drift in space forever as cold and dead as we are now\nand our ionic power won't last forever. The forces we will use could\nblow the planet apart. But we are going to try. We would rather die than\nlive as walking dead men in this perfect United Galaxies we do not\nwant.\"\n\nThe silence in the room was like a Salaman fog. Thick silence broken\nonly by the steady hum of the machines deep beneath us in the dead\nplanet. A wild, impossible dream of one thousand lost souls. A dream\nthat would destroy them, and they did not care. There was something\nabout it all that I liked.\n\nI said, \"Why not get Council approval?\"\n\nPortario smiled. \"Council has little liking for wild dreams, Commander.\nIt would not be considered as advancing the future of United Galaxies'\ndestiny. Then there are the ionics.\" And Portario hesitated. \"And there\nis the danger of imbalance, Galactic imbalance. I have calculated\ncarefully, the danger is remote, but Council is not going to take even a\nremote chance.\"\n\nYuan Saltario broke in. \"All they care about is their damned sterile\ndestiny! They don't care about people. Well we do! We care about\nsomething to live for. The hell with the destiny of the Galaxies! They\ndon't know, and we'll be gone before they do know.\"\n\n\"They know plenty now. O'Hara's beamed them in.\"\n\n\"So we must hurry,\" Portario said. \"Three days, Commander, will you\nprotect us for three days?\"\n\nA Council offense punishable by instant destruction with United Galaxies\nreserve ionic weapons in the hands of the super-secret police and\ndisaster teams. And three days is a long time. I would be risking my\nwhole Company. I heard Rajay-Ben laugh.\n\n\"Blast me, Red, it's so damned crazy I'm for it. Let's give it a shot.\"\n\nI did not know then how much it would really cost us. If I had I might\nnot have agreed. Or maybe I would have, it was good to know people could\nstill have such dreams in our computer age.\n\n\"Okay,\" I said, \"beam the full Companies and try to get one more.\nMandasiva's Sirian boys would be good. We'll split the fee three ways.\"\n\nYuan Saltario said, \"Thanks, Red.\"\n\nI said, \"Thank me later, if we're still around.\"\n\nWe beamed the Companies and in twenty minutes they were on their way.\nStraight into the biggest trouble we had had since the War of Survival.\nI expected trouble, but I didn't know how much. Pete Colenso tipped me\noff.\n\nPete spoke across the light years on our beam. \"Mandasiva says okay if\nwe guarantee the payment. I've deposited the bond with him and we're on\nour way. But, Red, something's funny.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"This place is empty. The whole damned galaxy out here is like a desert.\nEvery Company has moved out somewhere.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" I beamed, \"get rolling fast.\"\n\nThere was only one client who could hire all the Companies at one time.\nUnited Galaxies itself. We were in for it. I had expected perhaps ten\nCompanies, not three against 97, give or take a few out on other jobs.\nIt gave me a chill. Not the odds, but if Council was that worried maybe\nthere was bad danger. But I'd given my word and a Companion keeps his\nword. We had one ace in the hole, a small one. If the other Companies\nwere not here in Menelaus yet, they must have rendezvoused at Galaxy\nCenter. It was the kind of \"follow-the-book\" mistake United would make.\nIt gave us a day and a half. We would need it.\n\nThey came at dawn on the second day. We were deployed across five of\nthe dead planets of Menelaus XII in a ring around Nova-Maurania. They\ncame fast and hard, and Portario and his men had at least ten hours work\nleft before they could fire their reactors and pray. Until then we did\nthe praying. It didn't help.\n\nMandasiva's command ship went at the third hour. A Lukan blaster got it.\nBy the fourth hour I had watched three of my sub-command ships go. A\nSirian force beam got one, an Earth fusion gun got another, and the\nthird went out of action and rammed O'Hara's command ship that had been\nleading their attack against us. That third ship of mine was Pete\nColenso's. Old Mike would have been proud of his boy. I was sick. Pete\nhad been a good boy. So had O'Hara. Not a boy, O'Hara, but the next to\nthe last of old Free Companion from Earth. I'm the last, and I said a\nsilent good-bye to O'Hara. By the sixth hour Rajay-Ben had only ten\nships left. I had twelve. Five thousand of my men were gone. Eight\nthousand of Rajay-Ben's Lukans. The Sirians of Mandasiva's O Company\nwere getting the worst of it, and in the eighth hour Mandasiva's second\nin command surrendered. It would be over soon, too soon. And the dream\nwould be over with the battle. I broke silence.\n\n\"Red Stone calling. Do you read me? Commander Stone calling. Request\nconference. Repeat, request conference.\"\n\nA face appeared on the inter-Company beam screen. The cold, blank,\nhard-bitten face of the only Free Company Commander senior to me now\nthat O'Hara was gone, Jake Campesino of the Cygne Black Company. \"Are\nyou surrendering, Stone?\"\n\n\"No. I want to speak to my fellow Companions.\"\n\nCampesino's voice was like ice. \"Violation! You know the rules, Stone.\nSilence cannot be broken in battle. I will bring charges. You're\nthrough, Stone.\"\n\nI said, \"Okay, crucify me later. But hear me now.\"\n\nCampesino said, \"Close silence or surrender.\"\n\nIt was no good. We'd had it. And across the distance of battle\nRajay-Ben's face appeared on the screen. The colored lights that were a\nLukan's face and I knew enough to know that the shimmering lights were\nmad. \"The hell with them, Red, let's go all the damned way!\"\n\nAnd a new face appeared on the screen. A face I knew too well. First\nCouncillor Roark. \"Stone! You've done a lot in your day but this is the\nend, you hear me? You're defending a madman in a Council crime. Do you\nrealize the risk? Universal imbalance! The whole pattern of galaxies\ncould be destroyed! We'll destroy you for this, Stone. An ionic project\nwithout Council authorization.\"\n\nI said to Campesino, \"Five minutes, Commander. That's all.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a long blank on the screen, then Campesino's cold face\nappeared. \"Okay, Red, talk. I don't like civilian threats. You've got\nyour five minutes, make it good.\"\n\nI made it good. I told them of a handful of people who had a dream. A\nhandful of people who wanted their home back. A few lost souls who would\nrather die trying to live the way they wanted to live than go on living\nin a world they did not want. And I told them of the great United\nGalaxies, that had been created to protect the dreams of everyone in it\nand had forgotten why it had been created. I told them that it did not\nmatter who was right or wrong, because when a man can no longer dream\nsomething has gone wrong in the Universe. When I finished, Campesino's\nface was impassive.\n\nCampesino said, \"You heard Commander Stone, men. Close off, Stone, give\nme a minute to get the vote.\"\n\nI waited. It was the longest minute of my life.\n\n\"You win, Red,\" Campesino said. He was smiling at me. \"Go home,\nCouncillor, battle's over.\"\n\nThe Councillor went. He said there would be hell to pay, and maybe there\nwill be, but I don't think so, they still need us. We lost thirty\nthousand good men in all the Companies. But when the next dawn came\nNova-Maurania was gone. I don't know where they went, or what happened\nto them. Here in my stronghold I sometimes imagine them safe and\nrebuilding a green world where they can smoke pipes and live their own\nlives. And sometimes I imagine them all dead and drifting out there in\nthe infinity of space. I don't think they would mind too much, either\nway.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was first published in _Amazing Stories_ May 1961.\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
