He recognized the\ntype.\n\n\"So they're sending around cubs now,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm no cub--I've been on the paper a whole year,\" the reporter\nprotested, and then stopped, realizing his annoyance had betrayed him.\n\n\"Only a year. The first time they sent their best man.\"\n\n\"This ain't the first time,\" said the young man, assuming a bored look.\n\"It's the fourth time, and next year I don't think anybody will come at\nall. Why should they?\"\n\n\"Why, because they might be able to make it,\" Beryl spoke up. \"Something\nmust have happened before.\"\n\nStern watched the reporter drink in Beryl's loveliness.\n\n\"Well, Mrs. Curtis,\" the young man said, \"everyone has it figured out\nthat Dr. Curtis got stuck in the fourth dimension, or else lost, or\ndied, maybe. Even Einstein can't work out the stellar currents your\nhusband was depending on.\"\n\n\"It's very simple,\" replied Beryl, \"but I can't explain it intelligibly.\nI wish you could have talked to Dr. Curtis.\"\n\n\"Why is it that we have to come out here just once a year to wait for\nhim? Is that how the fourth dimension works?\"\n\n\"It's the only time when the stellar currents permit the trip back to\nEarth. And it's _not_ the fourth dimension! Clyde was always irritated\nwhen anyone would talk about his traveling to Mars in the fourth\ndimension.\"\n\n\"It's interdimensional,\" Stern put in.\n\n\"And you're his broker?\" asked the reporter, throwing his cigarette down\non the brick floor and stepping on it. \"You're his old friend from\ncollege days, handled his financial affairs, and helped him raise enough\nmoney to build his machine?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Stern replied, a little pompously. \"It was through my efforts\nthat several wealthy men took an interest in the machine, so that Dr.\nCurtis did not have to bear the entire expense himself.\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah,\" the reporter sighed. \"I read an old story on it before I\ncame here. Now I'm out of cigarettes.\" He looked hopefully at Stern.\n\nStern returned the look coldly. \"There's a store where you can buy some\nabout three blocks down the road.\"\n\n\"Is that the room where he's expected to materialize with his machine?\"\nThe reporter pointed to an inner door.\n\n\"Yes. Dr. Curtis wanted to be sure no one would be injured. This inner\ncircular room was built first; then he had the outer wall put up as an\nadded precaution. The circular passageway we're in leads all around the\nold room, but this doorway is the only entrance.\"\n\n\"And what are those holes in the top of the door for?\"\n\n\"If he returns, we can tell by the displaced air rushing out. Then the\ndoor will open automatically.\"\n\n\"And when is the return scheduled for?\" asked the reporter.\n\n\"Three-forty-seven and twenty-nine seconds.\"\n\n\"If it happens,\" the reporter added skeptically. \"And if it doesn't, we\nhave to wait another year.\"\n\n\"Optimum conditions occur just once a year.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm going out to get some cigarettes. I've got time ... and\nprobably nothing to wait for. I'll return though.\"\n\nHe walked briskly through the outer door.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"This is the hardest part of the year, especially now. Suppose he did\ncome back,\" Beryl said plaintively.\n\n\"You don't have to worry,\" Stern assured her. \"Clyde himself said that\nif he didn't come back the second year, he might not make it at all.\"\nStern opened his gold case now and offered Beryl a cigarette.\n\nShe shook her head. \"But he made two trial runs in it first and came\nback.\"\n\n\"That was for a short distance only--that is, a short distance\nastronomically. Figuring for Mars was another story. Maybe he missed the\nplanet and ...\"\n\n\"Oh, don't! It's just not _knowing_ that I can't stand.\"\n\n\"Well,\" he said drily, \"we'll know in--\" he stopped and looked at his\nwristwatch--\"in just about fifteen minutes.\"\n\n\"I can't wait,\" she moaned.\n\nHe put his arm around her. \"Relax. Take it easy and stop worrying. It'll\njust be like last time.\"\n\n\"Not the last time at all. We hadn't--\"\n\n\"As soon as we are able to leave here,\" he said, drawing her close and\nsqueezing her gently, \"I'll take steps to have him declared legally\ndead. Then we'll get married.\"\n\n\"That's not much of a proposal,\" she smiled. \"But I guess I'll have to\naccept you. You have Clyde's power of attorney.\"\n\n\"And we'll be rich. Richer than ever. I'll be able to use some of my own\nideas about the investments. As a matter of fact, I have already.\" And\nhe frowned slightly.\n\n\"We have enough,\" Beryl said quickly. \"Don't try to speculate. You know\nhow Clyde felt about that.\"\n\n\"But he spent so damned much on the machine. I had to make back those\nexpenses somehow.\"\n\nSteps sounded outside and they drew apart. The reporter came in with a\ncompanion of about his own age.\n\n\"Better wipe the lipstick off,\" he grinned. \"It's almost time for\nsomething to happen.\"\n\nStern dabbed at his mouth angrily with his handkerchief.\n\nAt first the sound was so soft that it could hardly be heard, but soon a\nwhistling grew until it became a threat to the eardrums. The reporters\nlooked at each other with glad, excited eyes.\n\nThe whistling stopped abruptly and, slowly, the door opened. The\nreporters rushed in immediately.\n\nBeryl gripped Stern's hand convulsively. \"He's come back.\"\n\n\"Yes, but that mustn't change our plans, Beryl dear.\"\n\n\"But, Al ... Oh, why were we so foolish?\"\n\n\"Not foolish, dear. Not at all foolish. Now we have to go in.\"\n\nInside the room was the large sphere of metalloy. It had lost its\noriginal gleam and was stained and battered, standing silent, closed,\nenigmatic.\n\n\"Where's the door?\" called the first reporter.\n\nThe sphere rested on a number of metal stilts, reaching out from the\nlower hemisphere, which held it about three feet from the floor, like a\ngreat pincushion turned upside down.\n\nSlowly, a round section of the sphere's wall swung outward and steps\ndescended. As they touched the floor, both reporters, caught by the same\nidea, sprinted for it and fought to see which would climb it first.\n\n\"Wait!\" shouted Stern.\n\nThe reporters stopped their scuffling and followed Stern's gaze.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSomething old and leathery and horrible was emerging from the circular\ndoorway. Several tentacles, like so many snakes, slid around the hand\nrail which ran down the steps. Then, at the top, it paused.\n\nStern felt an immediate and unreasoning hate for the thing, whatever it\nwas, a hate so strong that he forgot to feel fear. It seemed to him to\ncombine the repulsive qualities of a spider and a toad. The body, fat\nand repugnant, was covered by a loose skin, dull and leathery, and the\nfatness seemed to be pulled downward below the lower tentacles like an\ninsect's body, until it was wider at the bottom than at the top.\n\nLike a salt shaker, Stern thought.\n\nIt turned its head--it had no neck; the loose skin of the body just\nturned with it--and looked back inside the sphere. The head resembled a\ntoad's, but a long trident tongue slid in and out quickly, changing the\nresemblance to that of a malformed snake.\n\nFrom the interior, Dr. Curtis appeared beside the creature and stood\nthere vaguely for a moment. Stern noticed that his clothes seemed just\nas new as when he had left, but he had grown a long, untrimmed beard,\nand his face had a vacant expression, as if he were hypnotized.\n\nThe creature looked upward at Curtis, who was head and shoulders taller,\nand its resemblance changed again in Stern's mind, so that now it looked\nlike a dog, at least in attitude. From its mouth came a low hissing\nnoise.\n\n[Illustration: Illustrated by WILLER]\n\nCurtis looked down at the dog-spider-toad, his eyes slowly beginning\nto focus. The creature wiggled like a seal with a fish in sight, then\nslid and bumped down the steps, with Curtis following him.\n\n\"Clyde!\" cried Beryl and rushed toward Curtis.\n\nThe outstretched tentacles of the beast stopped her, but at a touch from\nCurtis they fell away and Beryl was in his arms.\n\nStern watched the scene sourly and with rage in his heart. Why hadn't\nClyde waited another year? Then nothing could have changed things. Now\nhe would lose not only Beryl, but the management of the money that was\nleft, and the marketing of new patents on the machine. Curtis did not\napprove of speculation, especially when it lost money.\n\n\"You've changed, Clyde,\" Beryl was saying as she hugged him. \"What is\nthe matter--do you need a doctor?\"\n\n\"No, I don't want a doctor, but I have to get home,\" said Curtis.\n\nStern felt anger again beating in his brain like heavy surf on a beach.\nCurtis was sick. The least he could have done was die. Well, maybe he\nstill would. And if he didn't he could be helped to--Stern saw the beast\nlooking at him intently, malevolently. Its face might have looked almost\nhuman, now that it was so close, if it had possessed eyebrows and hair.\nAs it was, its nose rose abruptly and flared into two really enormous\nnostrils, but its mouth looked small and wrinkled, like that of an old\ngrandmother without any teeth.\n\nThey turned to the doorway without noticing the absence of the\nreporters, who had long since run off to telephone and get\nphotographers.\n\nCurtis walked slowly. He would stop for a moment, look about as if\nexpecting something entirely different, and then he would move forward\nagain.\n\nThey all got into the car, Curtis and Beryl on the front seat, with\nBeryl driving, and Stern and the creature in the rear. As Beryl drove,\nStern looked savagely at the back of Curtis's head, but he felt the\nbeast staring at him balefully. Could it be a mind reader? That was\nridiculous. How could anything that couldn't speak read a person's mind?\n\nHe turned to study it. The Martian, if that was what it was, had only\nsix tentacles, three on each side. The lower ones were heavy and almost\nas thick as legs. The upper ones were small and were obviously used as\nhands, while it was possible that the middle ones could be used either\nway. A series of suction cups or sucking pads were at the end of each\ntentacle. With equipment like this, it could walk right up the side of a\nbuilding, except, perhaps, for the higher gravity of Earth.\n\nStern could smell it now, a dry, desert smell, and that made it more\nrevolting than ever. They were born to hate each other.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen they got home, Beryl was all solicitousness. The way a woman is\nwhen she has a man to impress, Stern thought.\n\n\"Just sit right here in your old chair,\" she told Curtis, \"and I'll call\na doctor. Then I'll put some water on to heat.\" But first she knelt by\nhis side and laid her head on his breast. \"Oh, darling,\" she said with a\nsob, \"Why did you wait so long? I've missed you so.\"\n\nA very good act, Stern told himself bitterly, without believing it at\nall.\n\nShe got up and turned toward Stern. \"Will you help me get some water on,\nAl?\" she asked. \"I'm going to phone.\"\n\nHe went into the kitchen. He knew where the kettle was, the\nrefrigerator, the mixings. He could hear her dialing, and then, before\nhe got the kettle on the burner, she came inside and closed the kitchen\ndoor.\n\n\"Clyde's sick and I have to take care of him,\" she said anxiously.\n\nIt wasn't entirely the money, he confessed to himself now. He hated the\nsituation, but he had to give in--on the surface anyway.\n\n\"Okay, let's forget the whole thing,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh, Al dear, I knew you'd understand! I've got to go back now and try\nthe phone again. I got a busy signal.\"\n\nStern followed her, still rankling at the way Curtis had forced Beryl to\nlive while he spent so generously on his own expensive interests.\nShortly after their marriage, he had built a home for Beryl and himself\nin an exclusive suburb, on a hilly bit of land with a deep ravine at the\nback. But it was small and Beryl had not even been allowed maids except\nwhen they entertained, which was seldom. Soon he would change all that,\nStern told himself. They had not dared to while Clyde was away.\n\nIn the modern living room, Curtis sprawled in his easy chair as though\nhe hadn't moved since they had placed him there. But his air of\nabstraction seemed to have increased. Before him sat the beast, looking,\nStern thought, more like a dog than ever. Its head wasn't cocked to one\nside, but that, less than its alien appearance, was the one thing to\nspoil the illusion.\n\nTires screeched in the driveway while Beryl was still at the telephone.\nStern went to the front door, closed it and put the chain bolt in\nplace. The back door would still be locked and they would hardly try to\nforce the screen windows.\n\nHeavy steps pounded up the front walk. \"Did Dr. Curtis really get back?\"\nThe first man shot out. The one who followed had a camera.\n\n\"Dr. Curtis has returned,\" Stern spoke through the opening of the front\ndoor which the chain permitted, \"but his physical condition won't permit\nquestioning, at least until his doctor has seen him.\"\n\n\"Did he really bring back a Martian? We want to see the Martian anyway.\"\n\n\"We can't have Dr. Curtis disturbed in any way until after his physician\nhas examined him,\" Stern said bluntly.\n\n\"Is he in there?\"\n\n\"We'll give you a report when we're ready.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA second car pulled up to the house as Stern shut the front door, and\nwent to check the rear one. When he came back, flashes from the window\nshowed the cameraman was trying to take pictures through the glass.\nStern drew the shades.\n\n\"Well, poor Schaughtowl, so you had to come with me,\" Curtis was saying\nto the monster.\n\nThe beast wiggled again as it had on the steps of the machine. A tail to\nwag wasn't really necessary, Stern decided, when there was so much body\nto wiggle.\n\nSchaughtowl, as Curtis addressed it, seemed to brighten in the darkened\nroom.\n\n\"Poor, dear Schaughtowl,\" said Curtis gently.\n\nIt was unmistakable now--the skin actually brightened and emitted a sort\nof eerie, luminous glow.\n\nCurtis leaned over and put his hand on what would have been\nSchaughtowl's neck. The loose skin writhed joyously, and, snakelike, the\nwhole body responded in rippling waves of emotion.\n\n\"Gull Lup,\" the monster--said wasn't the right word, but it was not a\nbark, growl, mew, cheep, squawk or snarl. Gulp was as close as Stern\ncould come, a dry and almost painful gulping noise that expressed\ndevotion in some totally foreign way that Stern found revolting.\n\nHe realized that the phone had been ringing for some time. He\ndisconnected it, and then heard loud knocking.\n\n\"It's Dr. Anderson,\" he heard a man's voice calling impatiently and\nangrily.\n\nCautiously, Stern opened the door, but his care was needless. With a few\ntesty remarks, the doctor quickly cleared a space about the door and\nentered.\n\nHe went at once to Curtis, with only a single shocked glance at\nSchaughtowl.\n\n\"Where the devil have you been and where in hell did you get that\nthing?\" he asked as he unbuttoned Curtis's coat and shirt.\n\nSince playing with his pet, Curtis seemed more awake. \"I went to Mars,\"\nhe said. \"They're incredibly advanced in ways we hardly guess. We're\nentirely off the track. I just came back to explain how.\"\n\n\"Your friend doesn't look very intelligent,\" the doctor answered, busy\nwith his stethoscope.\n\n\"Animals like Schaughtowl are used for steeds or pets,\" said Curtis.\n\"The Ladonai are pretty much like mankind, only smaller.\"\n\n\"Why did you stay so long?\"\n\n\"After I left, the Ladonai told me, they were going to shut off any\npossible communication with Earth until we advance more. They think\nwe're at a very dangerous animal-like stage of development. Once I came\nhome, I knew I couldn't go back, so I wanted to learn as much as I could\nbefore I left them.\"\n\n\"Stand up for a minute,\" ordered the doctor.\n\n\"Not right now,\" said Curtis. \"I'm too tired.\"\n\n\"You'd better get to bed, then.\"\n\n\"I think not. It's merely caused by the difference in gravity and\nheavier air. The Ladonai told me to expect it, but not to lie down.\nAfter a while I'll try to take a short walk.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSo Clyde wasn't going to die, after all, Stern thought. He had come home\nwith a message, and, remembering the determination of the man, Stern\nknew he wouldn't die until he had given it. But he had to die. He would\ndie, and who was competent enough to know that it wasn't from the shock\nof having come home to denser air and a heavier gravity?\n\nThere were ways--an oxygen tube, for example. Pure oxygen to be inhaled\nin his sleep by lungs accustomed to a rarified atmosphere, or stimulants\nin his food so it would look like a little too much exertion on a heart\nalready overtaxed. There were ways.\n\nStern's scalp tingled unpleasantly, and he saw the Martian looking at\nhim intently, coldly. In that moment Stern knew without question that\nhis mind was being read. Not his idea, perhaps, but his intent toward\nCurtis. The Martian would have to be attended to first.\n\n\"Is it true, Dr. Anderson? Will he be all right?\" Beryl was sitting on\nthe arm of the chair next to Schaughtowl, and she was looking at Clyde\nalmost as adoringly as the Martian. A few hours had undone all that\nStern had managed to do in four years.\n\nIf Stern had been uncertain, that alone would have decided him.\n\n\"I think so,\" said the doctor. \"He seems to be uncomfortable, rather\nthan in pain. I'll send you a prescription for his heart, if he breathes\ntoo heavily. Be sure, though, not to give him more than one pill in\nthree hours.\"\n\n\"Of course.\" Beryl was never that solicitous toward Stern.\n\n\"And you'll be in quarantine here until the government decides what, if\nany, diseases he and the Martian may have brought back with them.\"\n\n\"None at all, Doctor.\" Curtis's voice was markedly more slurred, and he\nstared intently with unblinking eyes at the blank wall.\n\n\"Well, that's something we can't tell yet. Well have to keep out the\npress and television men, anyway, because of your health. If I'm not\ndetained, I'll be back tomorrow morning. Call me if there's any change.\"\n\nOn his way out, the physician was besieged by reporters and\nphotographers, baulked of better subjects. Shortly after the doctor's\ndeparture, police sirens came screaming up. The men waiting around the\nhouse were moved outside the gate and a guard was set at every entrance.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLater, a messenger came, was interrogated by the police sergeant who\ntook a small package from him and brought it to the house.\n\n\"Medicine,\" the sergeant said, handing it gingerly to Stern. \"You can't\nleave here without permission.\" And he walked hurriedly away.\n\nThis might be the answer. Stern had a good idea of what the doctor had\nprescribed--something he'd said, for the heart. It must have been pretty\npowerful, too, for the doctor to warn against an overdose. Two at once\nmight do it, or another two a little later.\n\nBut there was Schaughtowl.\n\n\"Al,\" said Beryl, \"stay with Clyde while I fix something for him to\neat.\"\n\nShe was more beautiful than ever. Emotions, he thought wryly, become a\nwoman; they thrive on them. In a few minutes a woman could change like\nthis. It was enough to make a man lose faith in the sex.\n\n\"Certainly,\" he said easily.\n\nCurtis seemed to sleep with wide open eyes gazing blankly at the far\nwall. Schaughtowl sat motionless before him, watchful as a dog, yet\nstill like a snake or spider patiently waiting. Didn't the beast ever\nsleep?\n\nA drink was what Stern needed. He went to the closet and poured a double\nbrandy. He sipped it slowly. As delicious fire ran down his gullet and\nwarmed his stomach, he felt his tension ease and a sense of confidence\npervade his mind.\n\nHe needn't worry. He was always successful, except that once with the\nstocks. And he had calm nerves.\n\nThere were guards out in front now in khaki uniform; the Governor must\nhave called out a company of the National Guard. Stern noticed some\nstate police, too. The house was well guarded on the three sides\nsurrounded by a neat, white picket fence. In the back, the severe drop\ninto the ravine made guards there unnecessary.\n\nIt was dark before Dr. Curtis moved. Beryl was watching him; she had\nlittle to say to Stern now.\n\n\"How about some broth, dear?\" she asked Curtis immediately.\n\nSlowly, Clyde's eyes focused on her. He smiled. \"Let's try it.\"\n\nHe let Beryl feed him, sitting on a stool beside his chair and being\nunnecessarily motherly and coddling about it.\n\nFor a while after he had eaten, Clyde sat in his chair, looking at Beryl\nwith his new and oddly gentle smile. It seemed to activate some hidden\nresponse in her, for she glowed with tenderness.\n\n\"I suppose,\" Curtis slurred, \"I ought to try to walk now.\"\n\n\"Let me help.\" Stern rose and crossed the room.\n\nThe Martian rustled like snakes in the weeds, and hissed.\n\nBeryl said without suspicion, \"Thank you, Al. I knew you'd do whatever\nyou could for Clyde.\" And she rested her hand trustingly on his arm.\n\nWhat was past was past, not to be wept over, not to be regretted.\n\n\"Like to walk out in the back for the air?\" Stern asked. \"The breeze is\ncoming from that direction.\"\n\n\"That will do very well,\" said Curtis, obviously not caring a bit.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nStern helped Curtis from his chair and supported him under the arm. They\nwent out the back door, the Martian slithering after them. It was cooler\nin the garden. Stern felt a renewed surge of self-confidence.\n\n\"The stars--\" Curtis stopped to look upward.\n\nThe night was almost cloudless and there was no moon. The house hid any\nview of the crowds and the guards holding them back. They were alone in\nthe dark.\n\nCurtis started forward again, with the Martian scraping along behind. It\nwould never let Curtis out of its sight as long as it lived; that much\nwas clear to Stern.\n\nHe guided Curtis to a seat close to the ravine, a favorite spot. Always\nthe Martian was a step--or a slither--behind, and when Curtis sat down,\nSchaughtowl sat between his beloved master and the precipitous drop.\n\nStern picked up a rock from the rock garden and tossed it into the\nravine. The Martian did not take his eyes off Curtis. Stern picked up a\nlarger rock, a sharp, pointed one. He was behind the Martian and Curtis\nwas looking away unseeingly into the night.\n\nIt was simple, really, and well executed. The beast's skull bashed in\neasily, being merely thin bones for a thin atmosphere and light\ngravitation. A push sent it over the edge of the ravine.\n\nCurtis sat unnoticing, and the traffic jam out front created more than\nenough confusion to drown out any noise from the creature's fall.\n\nStern's palm stung. He realized that, before the Martian had pitched\nover the ravine, a suction pad had for a moment caught at his hand. It\nhad done the beast no good, though.\n\nCuriously, the Martian had not guarded itself, only Curtis. Sitting with\nits back to Stern had really invited attack. The mind-reading ability\nwas just something that Stern had nervously imagined.\n\nThe police would not be able to tell his rock from any other. The heavy\nbody, its ungainly movement and thin bones would explain everything.\nBesides, there was no motive for killing the Martian and what penalty\ncould there be? It couldn't be called murder.\n\nStern looked at the palm of his right hand, the one that had held the\nrock. It stung a little, but in the darkness he couldn't see it. A\nstinger of some kind, like a bee, probably. The hell with it--couldn't\nbe fatal or Curtis would have warned them about it.\n\nThe Martian had been walking by the ravine and had clumsily fallen in.\nHe would report it after he had got Curtis back into the house.\n\nCurtis was easy to arouse and didn't seem to miss Schaughtowl. Stern\nmaneuvered him to the living room, where he sank into a chair and fell\ninto his mood of abstraction.\n\nBeryl must be in the kitchen cleaning up, Stern supposed. Perhaps he had\nbetter put some kind of germicide on his palm, just to ward off\ninfection.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe looked at Curtis relaxed in the chair. Clyde suddenly appeared oddly\nboyish to him, hardly different than he had been in college days. For a\nmoment Stern felt again the adolescent admiration and fellowship he had\nfelt so strongly then. Don't be stupid, he told himself angrily. This\nman had the money and the woman that had almost belonged to him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMoving slowly, Stern deliciously savored the aroma of his triumph. On\nthe table was the bottle. Clyde would be easy, unsuspecting, kindly.\n\nIt wouldn't be safe to marry Beryl right away, but there could never be\nany suspicion.\n\nNo need to hurry. For a moment he wanted to watch Curtis. He wondered\nwhat kind of pictures Clyde was seeing on the blank wall. Martian\nlandscapes? The strange Ladonai? Too bad he hadn't stayed on Mars. Stern\ncouldn't help having a friendly feeling for his old college chum, pity,\ntoo, for what must happen to him soon.\n\nThis was no way to kill anyone!\n\nHe was growing old and soft!\n\nNevertheless, Curtis _did_ have a noble and striking face. Funny he had\nnever noticed it before. It seemed to glow with an uncanny peace.\n\nUnnoticed, the numbness crept from Stern's palm along his right arm, and\na prickly sensation appeared in his right leg.\n\nIt was funny to read a person's thoughts like this. Love flowed from\nCurtis like the warm glow from a burning candle. A sort of halo had\nformed from the light above his head.\n\nSymbolic.\n\nFrom Curtis came wave after wave of love. He could feel it pulsating\ntoward him, and he felt his own heart turn over, answer it. Yes, Curtis\nwas noble.\n\nStern sank cross-legged on the floor beside Curtis and gazed at him. The\nprickly sensation had ascended from his leg up through his chest and to\nhis neck. But it didn't matter. Now, for a last time, he could feel the\nspell of that perfect friendship--before the end.\n\nWhat end? Why should there be any end to this eternal moment?\n\nCurtis noticed him now. Those half-closed eyes were strangely\npenetrating. They looked him through.\n\n\"Well, Al,\" he said, \"so you killed Schaughtowl?\"\n\nStern looked at the kindly, godlike face and loved it.\n\nKilled whom?\n\n\"Poor Al,\" Curtis said. He leaned over and laid his hand on the back of\nStern's neck, fondling it much as one would a dog. \"Poor old Al.\"\n\nStern's heart leaped in joy. This was ecstasy. It must be expressed.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
