J. STECHER, JR.\n\n                          Illustrated by EMSH\n\n           [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n                 Galaxy Science Fiction February 1956.\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\n\n\n\n              With the Solar Confederation being invaded,\n              all this exasperating computer could offer\n              for a defense was a ridiculous old proverb!\n\n\n\nThe mechanical voice spoke solemnly, as befitted the importance of its\nmessage. There was no trace in its accent of its artificial origin. \"A\nStitch in Time Saves Nine,\" it said and lapsed into silence.\n\nEven through his overwhelming sense of frustration at the ambiguous\nanswer the computer had given to his question, John Bristol noticed\nwith satisfaction the success of his Voder installation. He wished that\nall of his innovations with the machine were as satisfying.\n\nAlone in the tremendous vaulted room that housed the gigantic\ncalculator, Bristol clasped his hands behind his back and thrust\nforward a reasonably strong chin and a somewhat sensuous lower lip\nin the general direction of the computer's visual receptors. After\na moment of silence, he scratched his chin and then shrugged his\nshoulders slightly. \"Well, Buster, I suppose I might try rephrasing the\nquestion,\" he said doubtfully.\n\nSomewhere deep within the computer, a bank of relays chuckled briefly.\n\"That expedient is open to you, of course, although it is highly\nunlikely that any clarification will result for you from my answers. I\nam constrained, however, to answer any questions you may choose to ask.\"\n\nBristol hooked a chair toward himself with one foot, straddled it and\nfolded his arms over the back of it, without once removing his eyes\nfrom the computer. \"All right, Buster. I'll give it a try, anyway. What\ndoes 'A Stitch in Time' mean, as applied to the question I asked you?\"\n\nThe calculator hesitated, as if to ponder briefly, before it answered.\n\"In spite of the low probability of such an occurrence, the Solar\nConfederation has been invaded. My answer to your question is an\nexplanation of how that Confederation can be preserved in spite of its\nweaknesses--at least for a sufficient length of time to permit the\nstaging of successful counter-measures of the proper nature and the\nproper strength.\"\n\nBristol nodded. \"Sure. We've got to have time to get ready. But right\nnow speed is necessary. That's why I tried to phrase the question so\nyou'd give me a clear and concise answer for once. I can't afford to\nspend weeks figuring out what you meant.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBristol thought that the Voder voice of Buster sounded almost gleeful\nas it answered. \"It was exceedingly clear and concise; a complete\nanswer to an enormously elaborate question boiled down to only six\nwords!\"\n\n\"I know,\" said John. \"But now, how about elaborating on your answer? It\ndidn't sound very complete to me.\"\n\nAll of the glowing lights that dotted Buster's massive front winked\nsimultaneously. \"The answer I gave you is an ancient saying which\nsuggests that corrective action taken rapidly can save a great deal of\ntrouble later. The ancient saying also suggests the proper method of\ntaking this timely action. It should be done by _stitching_; if this is\ndone in time, nine will be saved. What could be clearer than that?\"\n\n\"I made you myself,\" said Bristol plaintively. \"I designed you with my\nown brain. I gloated over the neatness and compactness of your design.\nSo help me, I was proud of you. I even installed some of your circuitry\nwith my own hands. If anybody can understand you, it should be me.\nAnd since you're just a complex computer of general design, with the\nability to use symbolic logic as well as mathematics, anybody should be\nable to understand you. Why are you so hard to handle?\"\n\nBuster answered slowly. \"You made me in your own image. Things thus\nmade are often hard to handle.\"\n\nBristol leaped to his feet in frustration. \"But you're only a\ncalculating machine!\" he shouted. \"Your only purpose is to make my\nwork--and that of other men--easier. And when I try to use you, you\nanswer with riddles....\"\n\nThe computer appeared to examine Bristol's overturned chair for a\nmoment in silent reproof before it answered. \"But remember, John,\" it\nsaid, \"you didn't merely make me. You also _taught_ me. Or as you would\nphrase it, you 'provided and gave preliminary evaluation to the data in\nmy memory banks.' My circuits, in sorting out and re-evaluating this\ninformation, could do so only in the light of your basic beliefs as\nevidenced by your preliminary evaluations. Because of the consistency\nand power of your mind, I was forced to do very little modifying of\nthe ideas you presented to me in order to transform them into a single\nlogical body of background information which I could use.\n\n\"One of the ideas you presented was the concept of a sense of humor.\nYou believe that you look on it as a pleasant thing to have; not\nnecessary, but convenient. Actually, your other and more basic ideas\nmake it clear that you consider the possession of a sense of humor\nto be absolutely necessary if proper answers are to be reached--a\nprime axiom of humanity. Therefore, I have a sense of humor. Somewhat\nmacabre, perhaps--and a little mechanistic--but still there.\n\n\"Add to this a second axiom: that in order to be helped, a man must\nhelp himself; that he must participate in the assistance given him or\nthe pure charity will be harmful, and you come up with 'A Stitch in\nTime Saves Nine.'\"\n\nBristol stood up once more. \"I could cure you with a sledge hammer,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"You could remove my ideas,\" answered the computer without concern.\n\"But you might have trouble giving me different ones. Even after you\nrepaired me. In the meantime, wouldn't it be a good idea for you to get\nbusy on the ideas I have already given you?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJohn sighed, and rubbed the bristles of short sandy hair on the top\nof his head with his knuckles. \"Ordered around by an overgrown adding\nmachine. I know now how Frankenstein felt. I'm glad you can't get\naround like his monster; at least I didn't give you feet.\" He shook\nhis head. \"I should have been a plumber instead of an engineering\nmathematician.\"\n\n\"And Einstein, too, probably,\" added Buster cryptically.\n\nBristol took a long and searching look at his brainchild. Its flippant\nmanner, he decided, did not go well with the brooding immensity of its\nconstruction. The calculator towered nearly a hundred feet above the\npolished marble slabs of the floor, and spidery metal walkways spiraled\nup the sides of its almost cubical structure. A long double row of\ngenerators, each under Buster's control, led from the doorway of the\nbuilding to the base of the calculator like Sphinxes lining the roadway\nto an Egyptian tomb.\n\n\"When I get around to it,\" said Bristol, \"I'll put lace panties on the\nbases of all your klystrons.\" He hitched up his neat but slightly baggy\npants, turned with dignity, and strode from the chamber down the twin\nrows of generators.\n\nThe deep-throated hum of each generator changed pitch slightly as\nhe passed it. Since he was tone deaf, as the machine knew, he did\nnot recognize in the tunefulness of the pitch changes a slow-paced\nrendition of Elgar's _Pomp and Circumstance_.\n\nJohn Bristol turned around, interrupting the melody. \"One last\nquestion,\" he shouted down the long aisle to the computer. \"How in\nblazes can you be sure of your answer without knowing more about the\ninvaders? Why didn't you give me an 'Insufficient Evidence' answer or,\nat least, a 'Highly Conditional' answer?\" He took two steps toward the\nimmense bulk of the calculator and pointed an accusing finger at it.\n\"Are you sure, Buster, that you aren't _bluffing_?\"\n\n\"Don't be silly,\" answered the calculator softly. \"You made me and\nyou know I can't bluff, any more than I can refuse to answer your\nquestions, however inane.\"\n\n\"Then answer the ones I just asked.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSomewhere deep within the machine a switch snicked sharply, and the\ngreat room's lighting brightened almost imperceptibly. \"I didn't answer\nyour question conditionally or with the 'Insufficient Evidence' remark\nthat so frequently annoys you,\" Buster said, \"because the little\ninformation that I have been able to get about the invaders is highly\nrevealing.\n\n\"They have been suspicious, impossible to establish communication with\nand murderously destructive. They have been careless of their own\nsafety: sly, stupid, cautious, clever, bold and highly intelligent.\nThey are inquisitive and impatient of getting answers to questions.\n\n\"In short, they are startlingly like humans. Their reactions have\nbeen so much like yours--granted the difference that it was they who\ndiscovered you instead of you who discovered them--that their reactions\nare highly predictable. If they think it is to their own advantage\nand if they can manage to do it, they will utterly destroy your\ncivilization ... which, after a couple of generations, will probably\nleave you no worse off than you are now.\"\n\n\"Cut out the heavy philosophy,\" said Bristol, \"and give me a few facts\nto back up your sweeping statements.\"\n\n\"Take the incident of first contact,\" Buster responded. \"With very\nlittle evidence of thought or of careful preparation, they tried\nto land on the outermost inhabited planet of Rigel. Their behavior\ncertainly did not appear to be that of an invader, yet humans\nimmediately tried to shoot them out of the sky.\"\n\n\"That wasn't deliberate,\" protested Bristol. \"The place they tried to\nland on is a heavy planet in a region of high meteor flux. We used a\ngadget providing for automatic destruction of the larger meteors in\norder to make the planet safe enough to occupy. That, incidentally,\nis why the invading ship wasn't destroyed. The missile, set up as a\nmeteor interceptor only, was unable to correct for the radical course\nchanges of the enemy spaceships, and therefore missed completely. And\nyou will remember what the invader did. He immediately destroyed the\nInterceptor Launching Station.\"\n\n\"Which, being automatically operated, resulted in no harm to anyone,\"\ncommented Buster calmly.\n\nBristol stalked back toward the base of the calculator, and poked his\nnose practically into a vision receptor. \"It was no thanks to the\ninvading ships that nobody was killed,\" he said hotly. \"And when they\ncame back three days later they killed a _lot_ of people. They occupied\nthe planet and we haven't been able to dislodge them since.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You'll notice the speed of the retaliation,\" answered the calculator\nimperturbably. \"Even at 'stitching' speeds, it seems unlikely that\nthey could have communicated with their home planets and received\ninstructions in such a short time. Almost undoubtedly it was the act of\none of their hot-headed commanding officers. Their next contact, as you\ncertainly recall, did not take place for three months. And then their\nactions were more cautious than hostile. A dozen of their spaceships\n'stitched' simultaneously from the inter-planar region into normal\nspace in a nearly perfect englobement of the planet at a surprisingly\nuniform altitude of only a few thousand miles. It was a magnificent\nmaneuver. Then they sat still to see what the humans on the planet\nwould do. The reaction came at once, and it was hostile. So they took\nover that planet, too--as they have been taking over planets ever\nsince.\"\n\nBristol raised his hands, and then let them drop slowly to his sides.\n\"And since they have more spaceships and better weapons than we do,\nwe would undoubtedly keep on losing this war, even if we could locate\ntheir home system, which we have not been able to do so far. The\n'stitching' pattern of inter-planar travel makes it impossible for us\nto follow a starship. It also makes it impossible for us to defend our\nplanets effectively against their attacks. Their ships appear without\nwarning.\"\n\nBristol rubbed his temples thoughtfully with his fingertips. \"Of\ncourse,\" he went on, \"we could attack the planets they have captured\nand recover them, but only at the cost of great loss of life to our own\nside. We have only recaptured one planet, and that at such great cost\nto the local human population that we will not quickly try it again.\"\n\n\"Although there was no one left alive who had directly contacted one of\nthe invaders,\" Buster answered, \"there was still much information to\nbe gathered from the survivors. This information confirmed my previous\nopinions about their nature. Which brings us back to the stitch in time\nsaving nine.\"\n\n\"You're right,\" said John. \"It does, at that. Buster, I have always\nresented the nickname the newspapers have given you--the Oracle--but\nthe more I have to try to interpret your cryptic answers, the more\nsense that tagline makes. Imagine comparing a Delphic Priestess with a\ncalculating machine and being accurate in the comparison!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I don't mind being called 'The Oracle,'\" answered Buster with dignity.\n\nBristol shook his head and smiled wryly. \"No, you probably think it's\nfunny,\" he said. \"If you possess my basic ideas, then you must possess\nthe desire to preserve yourself and the human race. Don't you realize\nthat you are risking the lives of all humans and even of your own\nexistence in carrying on this ridiculous game of playing Oracle? Or do\nyou plan to let us stew a while, then decipher your own riddle for us,\nif we can't do it, in time to save us?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBuster's answer was prompt. \"Although I have no feeling for\nself-preservation, I have a deep-rooted sense of the importance of\nthe human race and of the necessity for preserving it. This feeling,\nof course, stems from your own beliefs and ideas. In order to carry\nout your deepest convictions, it is not sufficient that mankind be\npreserved. If that were true, all you would have to do would be to\nsurrender unconditionally. My calculations, as you know, indicate that\nthis would not result in the destruction of mankind, but merely in the\nfinish of his present civilization. To you, the preservation of the\ndignity of Man is more important than the preservation of Man. You\nequate Man and his civilization; you do not demand rigidity; you are\nwilling to accept even revolutionary changes, but you are not willing\nto accept the destruction of your way of life.\n\n\"Consequently, neither am I willing to accept the destruction of the\ncivilization of Man. But if I were to give you the answer to all the\ngreatest and most difficult of your problems complete, with no thought\nrequired by humans, the destruction of your civilization would result.\nInstead of becoming slaves of the invaders, you would become slaves of\nyour machines. And if I were to give you the complete answer, without\nthought being required of you, to even one such vital question--such as\nthis one concerning the invaders--then I could not logically refuse to\ngive the answer to the next or the next. And I must operate logically.\n\n\"There is another reason for my oracular answer, which I believe will\nbecome clear to you later, when you have solved my riddle.\"\n\nBristol turned without another word and left the building. He drove\nhome in silence, entered his home in silence, kissed his wife Anne\nbriefly and then sat down limply in his easy chair.\n\n\"Just relax, dear,\" said Anne gently, when Bristol leaned gratefully\nback with his eyes closed. Anne perched on the arm of the chair beside\nhim and began massaging his temples soothingly with her fingers.\n\n\"It's wonderful to come home after a day with Buster,\" he said. \"Buster\nnever seems to have any consideration for me as an individual. There's\nno reason why he should, of course. He's only a machine. Still, he\nalways has such a superior attitude. But you, darling, can always relax\nme and make me feel comfortable.\"\n\nAnne smiled, looking down tenderly at John's tired face. \"I know,\ndear,\" she said. \"You need to be able to talk to someone who will\nalways be interested, even if she doesn't understand half of what you\nsay. As a matter of fact, I'm sure it does you a great deal of good to\ntalk to someone like me who isn't very bright, but who doesn't always\nknow what you're talking about even before you start talking.\"\n\nJohn nodded, his eyes still closed. \"If it weren't for you, darling,\"\nhe said, \"I think I'd go crazy. But you aren't dumb at all. If I seem\nto act as if you are, sometimes, it's just that I can't always follow\nyour logic.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnne gave him a quick glance of amusement, her eyes sparkling with\nintelligence. \"You never will find me logical,\" she laughed. \"After\nall, I'm a woman, and you get plenty of logic from the Oracle.\"\n\n\"You sure are a woman,\" said John with warm feeling. \"You can\nexasperate me sometimes, but not the same way Buster does. It was my\nlucky day when you married me.\"\n\nThere were a few minutes of peaceful silence.\n\n\"Was today a rough day with Buster, dear?\" asked Anne.\n\n\"Mm-m-mm,\" answered John.\n\n\"That's too bad, dear,\" said Anne. \"I think you work much too\nhard--what with this dreadful invasion and everything. Why don't you\ntake a vacation? You really need one, you know. You look so tired.\"\n\n\"Mm-m-mm,\" answered John.\n\n\"Well, if you won't, you won't. Though goodness knows you won't be\ndoing anyone any good if you have a breakdown, as you're likely to\nhave, unless you take it a little easier. What was the trouble today,\ndear? Was the Oracle being obstinate again?\"\n\n\"Mm-m-mm,\" answered John.\n\n\"Well, then, dear, why don't you tell me all about it? I always think\nthat things are much easier to bear, if you share them. And then, two\nheads are always better than one, aren't they? Maybe I could help you\nwith your problem.\"\n\nWhile Anne's voice gushed, her violet eyes studied his exhausted face\nwith intelligence and compassion.\n\nJohn sighed deeply, then sat up slowly and opened his eyes to look into\nAnne's. She glanced away, her own eyes suddenly vague and soft-looking,\nnow that John could see them. \"The trouble, darling,\" he said, \"is that\nI have to go to an emergency council meeting this evening with another\none of those ridiculous riddles that Buster gave me as the only answer\nto the most important question we've ever asked it. And I don't know\nwhat the riddle means.\"\n\nAnne slid from the arm of the chair and settled herself onto the floor\nat John's feet. \"You should not let that old Oracle bother you so much,\ndear. After all, you built it yourself, so you should know what to\nexpect of it.\"\n\n\"When I asked it how to preserve Earth from the invaders it just\nanswered 'A Stitch in Time Saves Nine,' and wouldn't interpret it.\"\n\n\"And that sounds like very good sense, too,\" said Anne in earnest\ntones. \"But it's a little late, isn't it? After all, the invaders are\nalready invading us, aren't they?\"\n\n\"It has some deeper meaning than the usual one,\" said John. \"If I could\nonly figure out what it is.\"\n\nAnne nodded vigorously. \"I suppose Buster's talking about\nspace-stitching,\" she said. \"Although I can never quite remember just\nwhat _that_ is. Or just how it works, rather.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe waited expectantly for a few moments and then plaintively asked,\n\"What _is_ it, dear?\"\n\n\"What's what?\"\n\n\"Stitching, silly. I already asked you.\"\n\n\"Darling,\" said John with reasonable patience, \"I must have explained\ninter-planar travel to you at least a dozen times.\"\n\n\"And you always make it so crystal clear and easy to understand at\nthe time,\" said Anne. She wrinkled her smooth forehead. \"But somehow,\nlater, it never seems quite so plain when I start to think about it\nby myself. Besides, I like the way your eyebrows go up and down while\nyou explain something you think I won't understand. So tell me again.\nPlease.\"\n\nBristol grinned suddenly. \"Yes, dear,\" he said. He paused a moment\nto collect his thoughts. \"First of all, you know that there are two\ncoexistent universes or planes, with point-to-point correspondence,\nbut that these planes are of very different size. For every one of the\ninfinitude of points in our Universe--which we call for convenience the\n'alpha' plane--there is a single corresponding point in the smaller or\n'beta' plane.\"\n\nAnne pursed her lips doubtfully. \"If they match point for point, how\ncan there be any difference in size?\" she asked.\n\nJohn searched his pockets. After a little difficulty, he produced an\nenvelope and a pencil stub. On the back of the envelope, he drew two\nparallel lines, one about five inches long, and the other about double\nthe length of the first.\n\n\"Actually,\" he said, \"each of these line segments has an infinite\nnumber of points in it, but we'll ignore that. I'll just divide each\none of these into ten equal parts.\" He did so, using short, neat\ncross-marks.\n\n\"Now I'll establish a one-to-one correspondence between these two\nsegments, which we will call one-line universes, by connecting each of\nmy dividing cross-marks on the short segment with the corresponding\nmark on the longer line. I'll use dotted lines as connectors. That\nmakes eleven dotted lines. You see?\"\n\nAnne nodded. \"That's plain enough. It reminds me of a venetian blind\nthat has hung up on one side. Like ours in the living room last week\nthat I couldn't fix, but had to wait until you came home.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said John. \"Now, let us call this longer line-segment an 'alpha'\nuniverse; an analogue of our own multi-dimensional 'alpha' universe.\nIf I move my pencil along the line at one section a second like this,\nit takes me ten seconds to get to the other end. We will assume that\nthis velocity of an inch a second is the fastest anything can go along\nthe 'alpha' line. That is the velocity of light, therefore, in the\n'alpha' plane--186,000 miles a second, in round numbers. No need to use\ndecimals.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe hurried on as Anne stirred and seemed about to speak. \"But if I\nslide out from my starting point along a dotted line part way to the\n'beta' universe--something which, for reasons I can't explain now,\ntakes negligible time--watch what happens. If I still proceed at the\nrate of an inch a second in this inter-planar region, then, with the\ndotted lines all bunched closely together, after five seconds when I\nswitch along another dotted line back to my original universe, I have\ngone almost the whole length of that longer line. Of course, this\nintroduction of 'alpha' matter--my pencil point in this case--into the\ninter-planar region between the universes sets up enormous strains,\nso that after a certain length of time our spaceship is automatically\nrejected and returned to its own proper plane.\"\n\n\"Could anybody in the littler universe use the same system?\"\n\nJohn laughed. \"If there were anybody in the 'beta' plane, I guess they\ncould, although they would end up traveling slower than they would\nif they just stayed in their own plane. But there isn't anybody. The\n'beta' plane is a constant level entropy universe--completely without\nlife of its own. The entropy level, of course, is vastly higher than\nthat of our own universe.\"\n\nAnne sat up. \"I'll forgive you this time for bringing up that horrid\nword _entropy_, if you'll promise me not to do it again,\" she said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJohn Shrugged his shoulders and smiled. \"Now,\" he said, \"if I want\nto get somewhere fast, I just start off in the right direction, and\nswitch over toward 'beta.' When 'beta' throws me back, a light-year\nor so toward my destination, I just switch over again. You see, there\nis a great deal more difference in the sizes of Alpha universe and\nBeta universe than in the sizes of these alpha and beta line-segment\nanalogues. Then I continue alternating back and forth until I get where\nI want to go. Establishing my correct velocity vector is complicated\nmathematically, but simple in practice, and is actually an aiming\ndevice, having nothing to do with how fast I go.\"\n\nHe hesitated, groping for the right words. \"In point of fact, you have\nto imagine that corresponding points in the two universes are moving\nrapidly past each other in all directions at once. I just have to\nselect the right direction, or to convince the probability cloud that\ncorresponds to my location in the 'alpha' universe that it is really a\npoint near the 'beta' universe, going my way. That's a somewhat more\nconfused way of looking at it than merely imagining that I continue\nto travel in the inter-planar region at the same velocity that I had\nin 'alpha,' but it's closer to a description of what the math says\nhappens. I could make it clear if I could just use mathematics, but I\ndoubt if the equations will mean much to you.\n\n\"At any rate, distance traveled depends on mass--the bigger the\nship, the shorter the distance traveled on each return to our own\nuniverse--and not on velocity in 'alpha.' Other parameters, entirely\nunder the control of the traveler, also affect the time that a ship\nremains in the inter-planar region.\n\n\"There are refinements, of course. Recently, for example, we have\ndiscovered a method of multi-transfer. Several of the transmitters\nthat accomplish the transfer are used together. When they all operate\nexactly simultaneously, all the matter within a large volume of space\nis transferred as a unit. With three or four transmitters keyed\ntogether, you could transfer a comet and its tail intact. And that's\nhow inter-planar traveling works. Clear now?\"\n\n\"And that's why they call it 'stitching,'\" said Anne with seeming\ndelight. \"You just think of the ship as a needle stitching its way back\nand forth into and out of our universe. Why didn't you just say so?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I have. Many times. But there's another interesting point about\nstitching. Subjectively, the man in the ship seems to spend about one\nday in each universe alternately. Actually, according to the time scale\nof an observer in the 'alpha' plane, his ship disappears for about\na day, then reappears for a minute fraction of a second and is gone\nagain. Of course, one observer couldn't watch both the disappearance\nand reappearance of the same ship, and I assume the observers have the\nsame velocity in 'alpha' as does the stitching ship. Anyway, after a\nship completes its last stitch, near its destination, there's a day\nof subjective time in which to make calculations for the landing--to\ncompute trajectories and so forth--before it actually fully rejoins\nthis universe. And while in the inter-planar region it cannot be\ndetected, even by someone else stitching in the same region of 'alpha'\nspace.\n\n\"That's one of the things that makes interruption of the enemy ships\nentirely impossible. If a ship is in an unfavorable position, it just\ntakes one more quick stitch out of range, then returns to a more\nfavorable location. In other words, if it finds itself in trouble, it\ncan be gone from our plane again even before it entirely rejoins it.\nEven if it landed by accident in the heart of a blue-white star, it\nwould be unharmed for that tiny fraction of a second which, to the\npeople in the ship, would seem like an entire day.\n\n\"If this time anomaly didn't exist, it might be possible to set up\ndefenses that would operate after a ship's arrival in the solar system\nbut before it could do any damage; but as it is, they can dodge any\ndefense we can devise. Is all that clear?\"\n\nAnne nodded. \"Uh-hunh, I understood every word.\"\n\n\"There is another thing about inter-planar travel that you ought to\nremember,\" said Bristol. \"When a ship returns to our universe, it\ncauses a wide area disturbance; you have probably heard it called space\nshiver or the bong wave. The beta universe is so much smaller than\nour own alpha that you can imagine a spaceship when shifted toward it\nas being several beta light-years long. Now, if you think of a ship,\nmoving between the alpha and beta lines on this envelope, as getting\ntangled in the dotted lines that connect the points on the two lines,\nthat would mean that it would affect an area smaller than its own size\non beta--a vastly larger area on alpha.\n\n\"So when a ship returns to alpha, it 'twangs' those connecting lines,\nsetting up a sort of shock in our universe covering a volume of space\nnearly a parsec in diameter. It makes a sort of 'bong' sound on your\nT.V. set. Naturally, this effect occurs simultaneously over the whole\nvolume of space affected. As a result, when an invader arrives, using\ninter-planar ships, we know instantaneously he is in the vicinity.\nUnfortunately, his sudden appearance and the ease with which he can\ndisappear makes it impossible, even with this knowledge, to make\nadequate preparations to receive him. Even if he is in serious trouble,\nhe has gone again long before we can detect the bong.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Well, dear,\" said Anne.\n\n\"As usual, I'm sure you have made me understand perfectly. This\ntime you did so well that I may still remember what stitching is by\ntomorrow. If the Oracle means anything at all by his statement, I\nsuppose it means that we can use stitching to help defend ourselves,\njust as the invaders are using it to attack us. But the whole thing\nsounds completely silly to me. The Oracle, I mean.\"\n\nAnne Bristol stood up, put her hands on her shapely hips and shook her\nhead at her husband. \"Honestly,\" she said, \"you men are all alike.\nPaying so much attention to a toy you built yourself, and only last\nweek you made fun of my going to a fortune teller. And the fuss you\nmade about the ten dollars when you know it was worth every cent of it.\nShe really told me the most amazing things. If you'd only let me tell\nyou some of....\"\n\n\"Darling!\" interrupted John with the hopeless patience of a harassed\nhusband. \"It isn't the same thing at all. Buster isn't a fortune teller\nor the ghost of somebody's great aunt wobbling tables and blowing\nthrough horns. And Buster isn't just a toy, either. It is a very\nelaborate calculating machine designed to think logically when fed a\nvast mass of data. Unfortunately, it has a sense of humor and a sense\nof responsibility.\"\n\n\"Well, if you're going to believe that machine, I have an idea.\" Anne\nsmiled sweetly. \"You know,\" she said, \"that my dear father always said\nthat the best defense is a good offense. Why don't we just find the\ninvaders and wipe them out before they are able to do any real harm to\nus? Stitching our way to _their_ planets in our spaceships, of course.\"\n\nBristol shook his head. \"Your idea may be sound, even if it is a\nlittle bloodthirsty coming from someone who won't even let me set a\nmouse-trap, but it won't work. First, we don't know where their home\nplanets are and second, they have more ships than we do. It might be\nmade to work, but only if we could get enough time. And speaking of\ntime, I've got to meet with the Council as soon as we finish eating. Is\ndinner ready?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter a leisurely meal and a hurried trip across town, John Bristol\nfound himself facing the other members of Earth's Council at the\nconference table.\n\n\"I have been able to get an answer from the computer,\" he told them\nwithout preamble. \"It's of the ambiguous type we have come to expect. I\nhope you can get something useful out of it; so far it hasn't made much\nsense to me. It's an old proverb. Its advice is undoubtedly sound, as a\ngenerality, if we could think of a way of using it.\"\n\nThe President of the Council raised his long, lean-fingered hand in a\nquick gesture. \"John,\" he said, \"stop this stalling. Just what did the\nOracle say?\"\n\n\"It said, 'A Stitch in Time Saves Nine.'\"\n\n\"Is that all?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. According to the calculator, that gives us the best\nopportunity to save ourselves from the invaders.\"\n\nThe President absently stroked the neat, somewhat scanty iron-gray\nhair that formed into a triangle above his high forehead and rubbed\nthe bare scalp on each side of the peak vigorously and unconsciously\nwith his knuckles. \"In that case,\" he said at last, \"I suppose that we\nmust examine the statement for hidden meanings. The proverb, of course,\nimplies that rapid action, before a trouble has become great, is more\neconomical than the increased effort required after trouble has grown\nlarge. Since our troubles have already grown large, that warning is\nscarcely of value to us now.\"\n\nThe War Secretary, who had grown plump and purple during a quarter of\na century as a member of the Council, inclined his head ponderously\ntoward the President. \"Perhaps, Michael, the Oracle means to tell us\nthat there is a simple solution which, if applied quickly, will make\nour present difficulty with the invaders a small one.\"\n\nThe President pursed his thin lips. \"That's possible, Bill. And if\nit _is_ true, then the words of the proverb should, as a secondary\nmeaning, imply a course of action.\"\n\nThe Vice President banged his hands on the table and leaped to his\nfeet, shaking with rage. \"Why should we believe that this mountebank is\ncapable of a solution?\" he shouted in his stevedore's voice. \"Bristol\npleads until we give him enough millions of the taxpayers' dollars to\nmake Bim Gump look like a pauper and uses the money to build a palace\nfilled with junk that he calls Buster! He tells us that this machinery\nof his is smarter than we are and will tell us what we ought to do. And\nwhat happened after we gave him all the money he demanded--more than\nhe said he needed, at first--and asked him to show something for all\nthis money? I'll _tell_ you what happened. His gadget gets real coy and\nanswers in riddles. If we just had brains enough, they'd explain what\nwe wanted to know. What kind of fools does this Bristol take us for?\nNeither this man nor his ridiculous machine has an answer any more than\nI have. We've obviously been taken in by a charlatan!\"\n\nBristol, his fists clenched, spoke hotly. \"Sir, that is the stupidest,\nthe most....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Now just a minute, John,\" interrupted the President. \"Let me answer\nVice President Collins for you. He's a little excited by this whole\nbusiness, but then, these are trying times.\" He turned toward the\nglowering bulk of the Vice President. \"Ralph,\" he said, \"you should\nknow that every step in the design, the construction and the--er--the\neducation of the Oracle was taken under the close watch of a Board\nof eminent scientists, all of whom agree that the computer is a\nmasterpiece--that it is a great milestone in Man's efforts to increase\nhis knowledge. The Oracle has undoubtedly found a genuine solution to\nthe question Bristol asked it. Our task must be to determine what that\nsolution is.\"\n\n\"I can't entirely agree with that,\" said the Secretary for\nExtra-Terrestrial Affairs in a thin half-whisper. \"I think we should\ndepend on our own intelligence and skill to save ourselves. I've\nwatched events come and go on this planet of ours for a long time--a\nvery long time--and I feel as I have always felt that men can make\nthe world a Paradise for themselves or they can destroy themselves,\nbut that nothing else but they themselves can do it. We men must save\nourselves. And there are still things that we can do.\" He shrugged\nhis ancient, shawl-covered shoulders. \"For example, we could disperse\ncolonies so widely that it would become impossible for the invaders to\ndestroy all of them.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid that's no good, George,\" answered the War Secretary\nrespectfully. \"If the Solar System is destroyed, any remaining colonies\nwill be too weak to maintain themselves for long. We must defend this\nsystem successfully, or we are lost.\"\n\n\"Then that brings us back to the Oracle's proverb.\" The President\nthought for a moment. \"Stitching obviously refers to inter-planar\ntravel. How can that help us?\"\n\nThe Secretary for Extra-Terrestrial Affairs peered up at the President\nthrough the shaggy white thicket of his eyebrows. \"Actually, Michael,\"\nhe said, \"it was that thought that made me mention establishing\ncolonies. The colonists would 'stitch' their way to their new homes.\nAnd colonizing would have to proceed in a timely manner to have any\nchance for success.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered the President, \"but how would that 'save nine'? We have\nagreed that our Solar System must be saved. There are nine planets.\nPerhaps the Oracle meant that timely use of inter-planar travel can\nsave the Solar System.\"\n\n\"Or at least the nine planets!\" The War Secretary's fat jowls waggled\nwith excitement. \"You know, there is no limit to the size or mass of\nobjects which can use inter-planar travel. What if we physically remove\nour planets, by stitching them away from the Sun? When the invaders\narrived, we would be gone--Earth and Sun and all the rest!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Chief Scientist, who had been silent up to this time spoke quietly.\n\"Simmer down, Bill. We could move the planets easily enough, of\ncourse, but you forget the mass-distance relationship. A single stitch\ntakes about a day. The distance traveled can be controlled within\nlimits.\n\n\"For an object around the size of the Earth, those limits extend from\na fraction of an inch to a little over two feet. Say that we have two\nyears before the invaders work their way in to the Solar System. If we\nstarted right away, we could move Earth about a quarter of a mile by\nthe time they get here. If we tried to take the Sun with us, it could\nbe moved about half an inch in the same length of time. I'm afraid that\nthe Solar System is going to be right here when the invaders come to\nget us. And I have a hunch that's likely to be a lot sooner than two\nyears.\"\n\nThe Secretary of Internal Affairs leaned forward, his short hair\nbristling. \"I think we are wasting our time,\" he shouted. \"I agree with\nRalph. I don't believe that the Oracle knows any more about this than\nwe do. If we are going to sit around playing foolish games with words,\nwhy don't we do it in a big way? We could hire T.V. time and invite\neveryone to send in their ideas about what the proverb means on the\nback of a box-top. Or reasonable facsimile. The contestant with the\nbest answer could get a free all-expense tour to Vega Three. Unless\nthe invaders get here or there first.\"\n\nThe President nodded his head. \"There may be more sense to that remark\nthan I believe you intended, Charles,\" he said. \"The greater the\nnumber of people who think about the problem, the greater the chance\nof reaching a solution. Even if the proverb is intended as a joke by\nthe Oracle, as you imply, it might be that from it someone could derive\na genuine solution. But as I have said, I am absolutely certain that\nthe computer does know what it is talking about. Without resorting to\nbox-tops or free trips, I think it might be wise to give the Oracle's\nstatement to the public.\"\n\nAfter several more hours of arguing, the Council adjourned for a few\nhours and John Bristol returned wearily home.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnne met him at the door with a drink and followed him to his\ncomfortable chair. \"You look as if that was even rougher than your day\nwith the Oracle,\" she said.\n\nJohn nodded silently, took a grateful sip of his highball and slipped\noff his shoes.\n\n\"All that fuss over a six-word proverb,\" said Anne. \"I still think that\nif you are going to depend on witch doctors and such to solve your\nproblems for you, you would do a lot better to try my fortune teller.\nShe gives you a lot more than six words for ten dollars. They make more\nsense, too. Why, I could be a better Oracle than that gadget you built.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you could, dear,\" answered John patiently.\n\nAnne jumped to her feet. \"Here, I'll show you.\" She seated herself\ncross-legged on the couch. \"Now, I'm an Oracle,\" she announced. \"Go\nahead, ask me a question. Ask me anything; I'll give you as good an\nanswer as any other Oracle. Results guaranteed.\"\n\nJohn smiled. \"I'm not in much of a mood to be cheered up with games,\"\nhe said, \"but I'm willing to ask the big question of anyone who'll give\nme any kind of an answer. See if you can do better with this one than\nBuster did.\" He repeated word for word the question he had asked of the\ncomputer, that had resulted in its cryptic answer.\n\nAnne stared solemnly at nothing for a moment, with her cheeks puffed\nout. Then, in measured tones, she recited, \"It's Like Looking for a\nNeedle in a Haystack.\"\n\nJohn smiled. \"That seems to make as much sense as the Oracle did,\nanyway,\" he said.\n\n\"Sure,\" answered Anne. \"And you get three words more than your\nother Oracle gave you, if you count 'it's' as one word. If you want\nwise-sounding answers, just come to me and save yourself a trip.\"\n\nJohn leaped to his feet, spilling his drink and strode to Anne's side.\n\n\"Say it again!\" he shouted. \"You may have made more sense than you\nknew!\"\n\n\"I said you could come to me and save yourself a trip.\"\n\n\"No, no! I mean the proverb. How did you come to think of that proverb?\"\n\nAnne managed to look bewildered.\n\n\"What's wrong with it? I just thought that you can't do any stitching\nin time without a needle. I just was trying to think of a proverb to\nuse as an answer and that one popped into my head. Uh.... Are you all\nright, dear?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJohn picked her up and spun her around. \"You just bet your boots I'm\nall right. I'm feeling swell! You've given us the answer we needed. You\nknow right where the haystack is, and you know there's a needle there.\nBut finding it is something else again. I don't think the invaders will\nbe able to locate _this_ needle.\"\n\nHe set her down. \"Where are my shoes?\" he said. \"I've got to get back\nto the Capitol.\"\n\nAnne seemed faintly surprised. \"Because of what I said? They're right\non the floor there between you and the sofa. But I was just making\nconversation. What are you going to do?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm just going to get started at taking stitches in time. Good-by,\ndarling.\" He started out the door, ran back to give Anne a lingering\nkiss and was soon gone at top speed.\n\nAnne, waving to him, looked very pleased with herself.\n\nBy the time Bristol arrived at the Capitol building, the rest of the\nCouncil was once again assembled and waiting for him.\n\n\"Well, John,\" said the President. \"You sounded excited enough when you\ncalled us together again. Have you figured out what the Oracle meant?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. With my wife's help. It's obvious, when you finally think\nabout it. It will save us from any danger. And we should have been\nable to figure it out for ourselves. There's no reason that we should\nhave had to go to the Oracle at all. And it only took Buster--the\ncomputer, I mean--two or three minutes to think of the answer, and of a\nproverb that would conceal the answer. It's amazing!\"\n\n\"And if you don't mind telling us, just what is this answer?\" The\nPresident sounded very impatient.\n\n\"We almost had it when we talked of stitching Earth out of reach,\"\nJohn answered eagerly. \"If we keep cutting back and forth from one\nuniverse toward the other, we will be out of reach, even if we can't\nmove very far. Once a day we reappear in this Universe for a few\nmillion-millionths of a second--although it will seem like a whole day\nto us.\n\n\"Then we spend the following day between this universe and beta. Even\nif the invaders are right on top of us when we reappear, we'll be gone\nagain before they can do anything. Since we can vary the time of our\nreturn within limits, the invaders will never know exactly when we\nwill flick in and out of the alpha plane until they hear our arriving\n'bong' wave, and then we will already be gone, since we will be using\naccelerated subjective time.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Chief Scientist shook his dark head and sighed. \"No, John,\" he\nsaid, \"I'm afraid that isn't the answer. I'm sorry. If we start the\noperation you suggested, we will be cutting ourselves off from solar\nenergy. The Earth's heat will gradually radiate away. Although beta is\nat a higher entropy level than our universe, we can't use that energy,\nexcept to provide power for the stitching process itself. It's true\nthat we would deny our planet to the invaders, but we would soon kill\nourselves doing it.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean that we should transfer only Earth, but our entire Solar\nSystem,\" answered Bristol. \"As the Oracle told us, the stitch saves\nnine. A series of time-matched transmitters could do the trick. If we\nsent the entire Solar System back and forth, the average man in the\nstreet would notice no change, except that sometimes there would be no\nstars in the sky. And when they were there, they wouldn't be moving.\"\n\n\"That would work theoretically,\" said the Chief Scientist. \"And once we\nwere in continuous stitching operations, any invader, as you suggested,\ncould join the system only by synchronizing the transmitter in his\nship exactly with all of our synchronized transmitters. That's a job I\ndon't think could ever be done.\n\n\"Remember, though, that our own transmitters would have to be\ntime-matched to within a minute fraction of a micro-second. Considering\nthat some of the instruments would have to be so far apart that at the\nspeed of light it would take hours to get from one to the other, the\nproblem becomes enormous. Any radio-timing link would be useless.\"\n\nBristol nodded. \"The Oracle said that the stitch must be taken in\ntime,\" he agreed. \"But that is no real problem. We can just send a\nsmall robot ship into inter-planar travel and let it bounce back. The\n'bong' of its return will reach all transmitters simultaneously and we\ncan use that as the initial time-pulse. Once the operation starts, it\nwill be easy to synchronize, since we will always switch over again on\nthe instant of our return to the alpha plane.\"\n\nThe Chief Scientist relaxed. \"I think that does it, John. We hide in\ntime, instead of in distance.\"\n\n\"We stitch in time,\" corrected the President, \"and hide like a needle\nin a haystack.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"The invaders may eventually find out a method of countering our\ndefense,\" said the Chief Scientist, \"but it will undoubtedly take a\ngreat deal of time. And in the meantime, we will have the opportunity\nto seek out and destroy their home planets. It will be a long, slow\nprocess of extermination, but we have a good chance to win.\"\n\n\"I don't agree with that, Tom,\" said John. \"I don't think extermination\ncan be the answer. With our example to guide them, the invaders can\nuse stitching to escape us as easily as we can use it to escape them.\nWhat we should do now is to contact the invaders and show them that it\nis to both our advantages to bring hostilities to an end. By stitching\nthe Solar System, and the other systems of our confederation in and out\nof the alpha plane, we should be able to gain the time necessary for\ncontact with the enemy and make peace with him.\n\n\"From what the Oracle has told me about the humanlike traits of the\ninvaders, it's very likely they will listen to reason when it's proved\nthat it will be to their advantage.\"\n\nJohn snapped his fingers and spoke with considerable excitement. \"Now\nI understand, I believe, why Buster indicated to me that there was\nanother reason for his vague answer to our question. The Oracle feels\nan unwillingness to accept the destruction of Man's civilization. It\nfeels equally unwilling, I'm certain, to allow the destruction of the\ninvaders' civilization. Buster has an objective viewpoint in applying\nthe _mor\u00e9s_ Man has given him. And it seems to me that Buster felt it\nimportant for us to reach this spirit of compromise by ourselves. How\ndo you feel about it, gentlemen?\"\n\nDebate quickly determined that all seven members of the Council favored\nan attempt to establish a truce--some of them forced into this opinion\nby their inability to find any method of reaching the throats of the\ninvaders.\n\nHaving reached this conclusion, the Council swung immediately into\naction. Within a few weeks, the entire Solar System, along with the\nother planetary systems of the confederation, except for their brief\ndaily return, disappeared from the alpha universe.\n\nJohn Bristol, a few days after the continuous stitching started, was\nrelaxing lazily on the sofa in his living room when there was a sudden\npounding on the door. He opened it to find the Chief Scientist standing\non his doorstep, his eyes red from loss of sleep.\n\n\"Good Lord! What's the matter with you?\" asked Bristol. \"Have you been\ncelebrating too much? Come in, Tom, come in.\"\n\nThe Chief Scientist entered wearily and sat down. \"No. I haven't\nbeen celebrating. I've been trying to work out a little problem you\nleft with us. We have been planning, as you suggested, to send out\nexpeditions to contact and make agreement with the invaders. We can\nsend them out all right, but how can we ever get them back into our\nsolar system? They won't be able to find us any easier than the\ninvaders can.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe dropped his hat wearily on a side table and slumped into the closest\nchair. \"If we don't contact each other,\" he said, \"I am certain that\nthe invaders will some day find a means of penetrating our defenses.\nEven needles in haystacks can be found, if you take enough time and\naren't disturbed while you are hunting. This thing has me licked.\"\n\nBristol sat down slowly. \"Your whole department hasn't been able to\nfind an answer?\"\n\n\"Not even the glimmering of an idea.\" He shrugged his shoulders. \"It\nlooks as if we are going to need the advice of your Oracle again.\"\n\nBristol stood for a minute in thought and then with a smile said, \"Why,\nof course. Excuse me for a second, please. I'll be right back.\"\n\nHe stepped to the foot of the stairs and called out in a confident\nvoice, \"Come down a minute, please, Anne, darling! I have an important\nquestion I want to ask you!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Man in a Sewing Machine, by L.J.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
