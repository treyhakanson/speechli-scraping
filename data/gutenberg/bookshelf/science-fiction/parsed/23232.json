People don't quite believe it....\n\n\nby Robert J. Young\n\n\nIllustrated by Schoenherr\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\nIf you have ever lived in a small town, you have seen Francis Pfleuger,\nand probably you have sent him after sky-hooks, left-handed\nmonkey-wrenches and pails of steam, and laughed uproariously behind his\nback when he set forth to do your bidding. The Francis Pfleugers of the\nworld have inspired both fun and laughter for generations out of mind.\n\nThe Francis Pfleuger we are concerned with here lived in a small town\nnamed Valleyview, and in addition to suffering the distinction of being\nthe village idiot, he also suffered the distinction of being the village\ninventor. These two distinctions frequently go hand in hand, and afford,\nin their incongruous togetherness, an even greater inspiration for fun\nand laughter. For in this advanced age of streamlined electric can\nopeners and sleek pop-up toasters, who but the most na\u00efve among us can\nfail to be titillated by the thought of a buck-toothed, wall-eyed moron\nbuilding Rube Goldberg contrivances in his basement?\n\nThe Francis Pfleuger we are concerned with did his inventing in his\nkitchen rather than in his basement; nevertheless, his machines were in\nthe Rube Goldberg tradition. Take the one he was assembling now, for\nexample. It stood on the kitchen table, and its various attachments\njutted this way and that with no apparent rhyme or reason. In its center\nthere was a transparent globe that looked like an upside-down goldfish\nbowl, and in the center of the bowl there was an object that startlingly\nresembled a goldfish, but which, of course, was nothing of the sort.\nWhatever it was, though, it kept growing brighter and brighter each time\nFrancis added another attachment, and had already attained a degree of\nincandescence so intense that he had been forced to don cobalt-blue\ngoggles in order to look at it. The date was the First of April,\n1962--April Fool's Day.\n\nActually, the idea for this particular machine had not originated in\nFrancis' brain, nor had the parts for it originated in his\nkitchen-workshop. When he had gone out to get the milk that morning he\nhad found a box on his doorstep, and in the box he had found the\ngoldfish bowl and the attachments, plus a sheet of instructions\nentitled, DIRECTIONS FOR ASSEMBLING A MULTIPLE M\u00d6BIUS-KNOT DYNAMO.\nFrancis thought that a machine capable of tying knots would be pretty\nkeen, and he had carried the box into the kitchen and set to work\nforthwith.\n\nHe now had but one more part to go, and he proceeded to screw it into\nplace. Then he stepped back to admire his handiwork. Simultaneously his\nhandiwork went into action. The attachments began to quiver and to emit\nsparks; the globe glowed, and the goldfishlike object in its center\nbegan to dart this way and that as though striking at flies. A blue halo\nformed above the machine and began to rotate. Faster and faster it\nrotated, till finally its gaseous components separated and flew off in a\nhundred different directions. Three things happened then in swift\nsuccession: Francis' back doorway took on a bluish cast, the sheet of\ninstructions vanished, and the machine began to melt.\n\nA moment later he heard a whining sound on his back doorstep.\n\nSimultaneously all of the residents of Valleyview heard whining sounds\non _their_ back doorsteps.\n\nNaturally everybody went to find out about the whining.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe sign was a new one. At the most it was no more than six months old.\nYOU ARE ENTERING THE VILLAGE OF VALLEYVIEW, it said. PLEASE DRIVE\nCAREFULLY--WE ARE FOND OF OUR DOGS.\n\nPhilip Myles drove carefully. He was fond of dogs, too.\n\nNight had tiptoed in over the October countryside quite some time ago,\nbut the village of Valleyview had not turned on so much as a single\nstreetlight--nor, apparently, any other kind of light. All was in\ndarkness, and not a soul was to be seen. Philip began to suspect that he\nhad entered a ghost town, and when his headlights darted across a dark\nintersection and picked up the overgrown grass and unkempt shrubbery of\nthe village park, he was convinced that he had. Then he saw the girl\nwalking the dog.\n\nHe kitty-cornered the intersection and pulled up alongside her. She was\na blonde, tall and chic in a gray fall suit. Her face was\nattractive--beautiful even, in a cold and classic way--but she would\nnever see twenty-five again. But then, Philip would never again see\nthirty. When she paused, her dog paused too, although she did not have\nit on a leash. It was on the small side, tawny in hue, with golden-brown\neyes, a slender white-tipped tail, and shaggy ears that hung down on\neither side of its face in a manner reminiscent of a cocker spaniel's.\nIt wasn't a cocker spaniel, though. The ears were much too long, for one\nthing, and the tail was much too delicate, for another. It was a\nbreed--or combination of breeds--that Philip had never seen before.\n\nHe leaned across the seat and rolled down the right-hand window. \"Could\nyou direct me to number 23 Locust Street?\" he asked. \"It's the residence\nof Judith Darrow, the village attorney. Maybe you know her.\"\n\nThe girl gave a start. \"Are _you_ the real-estate man I sent for?\"\n\nPhilip gave a start, too. Recovering himself, he said, \"Then _you're_\nJudith Darrow. I'm ... I'm afraid I'm a little late.\"\n\nThe girl's eyes flashed. The radiant backwash of the headlights revealed\nthem to be both green and gray. \"I specified in my letter that you were\nsupposed to be here at nine o'clock this morning!\" she said. \"Maybe\nyou'll tell me how you're going to appraise property in the dark!\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Philip said. \"My car broke down on the way, and I had to\nwait for it to be fixed. When I tried to call you, the operator told me\nthat your phone had been disconnected. If you'll direct me to the hotel,\nI'll stay there overnight and appraise your property in the morning.\nThere _is_ a hotel, isn't there?\"\n\n\"There is--but it's closed. Zarathustra--down!\" The dog had raised up on\nits hind legs and placed its forepaws on the door in an unsuccessful\nattempt to peer in the window. At the girl's command, it sank obediently\ndown on its haunches. \"Except for Zarathustra and myself,\" she went on,\n\"the village is empty. Everyone else has already moved out, and we'd\nhave moved out, too, if I hadn't been entrusted with arranging for the\nsale of the business places and the houses. It makes for a rather\nawkward situation.\"\n\nShe had leaned forward, and the light from the dash lay palely upon her\nface, softening its austerity. \"I don't get this at all,\" Philip said.\n\"From your letter I assumed you had two or three places you wanted me to\nsell, but not a whole town. There must have been at least a thousand\npeople living here, and a thousand people just don't pack up and move\nout all at once.\" When she volunteered no explanation, he added, \"Where\ndid they move to?\"\n\n\"To Pfleugersville. I know you've never heard of it, so save the\nobservation.\" Then, \"Do you have any identification?\" she asked.\n\nHe gave her his driver's license, his business card and the letter she\nhad written him. After glancing at them, she handed them back. She\nappeared to be undecided about something. \"Why don't you let me stay at\nthe hotel?\" he suggested. \"You must have the key if it's one of the\nplaces I'm supposed to appraise.\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"I have the key, but there's not a stick of\nfurniture in the place. We had a village auction last week and got rid\nof everything that we didn't plan on taking with us.\" She sighed. \"Well,\nthere's nothing for it, I guess. The nearest motel is thirty miles away,\nso I'll have to put you up at my house. I have a few articles of\nfurniture left--wedding gifts, mostly, that I was too sentimental to\npart with.\" She got into the car. \"Come on, Zarathustra.\"\n\nZarathustra clambered in, leaped across her lap and sat down between\nthem. Philip pulled away from the curb. \"That's an odd name for a dog,\"\nhe said.\n\n\"I know. I guess the reason I gave it to him is because he puts me in\nmind of a little old man sometimes.\"\n\n\"But the original Zarathustra isn't noted for his longevity.\"\n\n\"Perhaps another association was at work then. Turn right at the next\ncorner.\"\n\nA lonely light burned in one of number 23 Locust Street's three front\nwindows. Its source, however, was not an incandescent bulb, but the\nmantle of a gasoline lantern. \"The village power-supply was shut off\nyesterday,\" Judith Darrow explained, pumping the lantern into renewed\nbrightness. She glanced at him sideways. \"Did you have dinner?\"\n\n\"As a matter of fact--no. But please don't--\"\n\n\"Bother? I couldn't if I wanted to. My larder is on its last legs. But\nsit down, and I'll make you some sandwiches. I'll make a pot of coffee\ntoo--the gas hasn't been turned off yet.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe living room had precisely three articles of furniture to its\nname--two armchairs and a coffee table. After Judith left him, Philip\nset his brief case on the floor and sat down in one of the chairs. He\nwondered idly how she expected to make the trip to Pfleugersville. He\nhad seen no car in the driveway, and there was no garage on the property\nin which one could be concealed. Moreover, it was highly unlikely that\nbuses serviced the village any more. Valleyview had been bypassed quite\nsome time ago by one of the new super-duper highways. He shrugged.\nGetting to Pfleugersville was her problem, not his.\n\nHe returned his attention to the living room. It was a large room. The\nhouse was large, too--large and Victorianesque. Judith, apparently, had\nopened the back door, for a breeze was wafting through the downstairs\nrooms--a breeze laden with the scent of flowers and the dew-damp breath\nof growing grass. He frowned. The month was October, not June, and since\nwhen did flowers bloom and grass grow in October? He concluded that the\nscent must be artificial.\n\nZarathustra was regarding him with large golden eyes from the middle of\nthe living-room floor. The animal did somehow bring to mind a little old\nman, although he could not have been more than two or three years old.\n\"You're not very good company,\" Philip said.\n\n\"Ruf,\" said Zarathustra, and turning, trotted through an archway into a\nlarge room that, judging from the empty shelves lining its walls, had\nonce been a library, and thence through another archway into another\nroom--the dining room, undoubtedly--and out of sight.\n\nPhilip leaned back wearily in the armchair he had chosen. He was beat.\nTake six days a week, ten hours a day, and multiply by fifty-two and you\nget three hundred and twelve. Three hundred and twelve days a year,\nhunting down clients, talking, walking, driving, expounding; trying in\nhis early thirties to build the foundation he should have begun building\nin his early twenties--the foundation for the family he had suddenly\nrealized he wanted and someday hoped to have. Sometimes he wished that\nambition had missed him altogether instead of waiting for so long to\nstrike. Sometimes he wished he could have gone right on being what he\nonce had been. After all, there was nothing wrong in living in cheap\nhotels and even cheaper rooming houses; there was nothing wrong in being\na lackadaisical door-to-door salesman with run-down heels.\n\nNothing wrong, that is, except the aching want that came over you\nsometimes, and the loneliness of long and empty evenings.\n\nZarathustra had re-entered the room and was sitting in the middle of the\nfloor again. He had not returned empty-handed--or rather,\nempty-mouthed--although the object he had brought with him was not the\nsort of object dogs generally pick up. It was a rose--\n\nA green rose.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDisbelievingly, Philip leaned forward and took it from the animal's\nmouth. Before he had a chance to examine it, however, footsteps sounded\nin the next room, and prompted by he knew not what, he thrust the rose\ninto his suitcoat pocket. An instant later, Judith Darrow came through\nthe archway bearing a large tray. After setting it down on the coffee\ntable, she poured two cups of coffee from a little silver pot and\nindicated a plate of sandwiches. \"Please help yourself,\" she said.\n\nShe sat down in the other chair and sipped her coffee. He had one of the\nsandwiches, found that he didn't want any more. Somehow, her proximity,\ncoupled with her silence, made him feel uncomfortable. \"Has your husband\nalready left for Pfleugersville?\" he asked politely.\n\nHer gray-green eyes grew cold. \"Yes, he left quite some time ago,\" she\nsaid. \"A year ago, as a matter of fact. But for parts unknown, not\nPfleugersville. Pfleugersville wasn't accessible then, anyway. He had a\nbrunette on one arm, a redhead on the other, and a pint of Cutty Sark in\nhis hip pocket.\"\n\nPhilip was distressed. \"I ... I didn't mean to pry,\" he said. \"I'm--\"\n\n\"Sorry? Why should you be? Some men are born to settle down and raise\nchildren and others are born to drink and philander. It's as simple as\nthat.\"\n\n\"Is it?\" something made Philip ask. \"Into which category would you say I\nfall?\"\n\n\"You're in a class by yourself.\" Tiny silver flecks had come into her\neyes, and he realized to his astonishment that they were flecks of\nmalevolence. \"You've never married, but playing the field hasn't made\nyou one hundred per cent cynical. You're still convinced that somewhere\nthere is a woman worthy of your devotion. And you're quite right--the\nworld is full of them.\"\n\nHis face tingled as though she had slapped it, and in a sense, she had.\nHe restrained his anger with difficulty. \"I didn't know that my celibacy\nwas that noticeable,\" he said.\n\n\"It isn't. I took the liberty of having a private investigator check\ninto your background. It proved to be unsavory in some respects, as I\nimplied before, but unlike the backgrounds of the other real-estate\nagents I had checked, it contained not the slightest hint of dishonesty.\nThe nature of my business is such that I need someone of maximum\nintegrity to contract it with. I had to go far and wide to find you.\"\n\n\"You're being unfair,\" Philip said, mollified despite himself. \"Most\nreal-estate agents are honest. As a matter of fact, there's one in the\nsame office building with me that I'd trust with the family jewels--if I\nhad any family jewels.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Judith Darrow said. \"I gambled on you knowing someone like\nthat.\"\n\nHe waited for her to elaborate, and when she did not he finished his\ncoffee and stood up. \"If you don't mind, I'll turn in,\" he said. \"I've\nhad a pretty hard day.\"\n\n\"I'll show you your room.\"\n\nShe got two candles, lit them, and after placing them in gilt\ncandlesticks, handed one of the candlesticks to him. The room was on the\nthird floor in under the eaves--as faraway from hers, probably, as the\nsize of the house permitted. Philip did not mind. He liked to sleep in\nrooms under eaves. There was an enchantment about the rain on the roof\nthat people who slept in less celestial bowers never got to know. After\nJudith left, he threw open the single window and undressed and climbed\ninto bed. Remembering the rose, he got it out of his coat pocket and\nexamined it by candlelight. It was green all right--even greener than he\nhad at first thought. Its scent was reminiscent of the summer breeze\nthat was blowing through the downstairs rooms, though not at all in\nkeeping with the chill October air that was coming through his bedroom\nwindow. He laid it on the table beside the bed and blew out the candle.\nHe would go looking for the bush tomorrow.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPhilip was an early riser, and dawn had not yet departed when, fully\ndressed, he left the room with the rose in his coat pocket and quietly\ndescended the stairs. Entering the living room, he found Zarathustra\ncurled up in one of the armchairs, and for a moment he had the eerie\nimpression that the animal had extended one of his shaggy ears and was\nscratching his back with it. When Philip did a doubletake, however, the\near was back to normal size and reposing on its owner's tawny cheek.\nRubbing the sleep out of his eyes, he said, \"Come on, Zarathustra, we're\ngoing for a walk.\"\n\nHe headed for the back door, Zarathustra at his heels. A double door\nleading off the dining room barred his way and proved to be locked.\nFrowning, he returned to the living room. \"All right,\" he said to\nZarathustra, \"we'll go out the front way then.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nHe walked around the side of the house, his canine companion trotting\nbeside him. The side yard turned out to be disappointing. It contained\nno roses--green ones, or any other kind. About all it did contain that\nwas worthy of notice was a dog house--an ancient affair that was much\ntoo large for Zarathustra and which probably dated from the days when\nJudith had owned a larger dog. The yard itself was a mess: the grass\nhadn't been cut all summer, the shrubbery was ragged, and dead leaves\nlay everywhere. A similar state of affairs existed next door, and\nglancing across lots, he saw that the same desuetude prevailed\nthroughout the entire neighborhood. Obviously the good citizens of\nValleyview had lost interest in their real estate long before they had\nmoved out.\n\nAt length his explorations led him to the back door. If there were green\nroses anywhere, the trellis that adorned the small back porch was the\nlogical place for them to be. He found nothing but bedraggled Virginia\ncreeper and more dead leaves.\n\nHe tried the back door, and finding it locked, circled the rest of the\nway around the house. Judith was waiting for him on the front porch.\n\"How nice of you to walk Zarathustra,\" she said icily. \"I do hope you\nfound the yard in order.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe yellow dress she was wearing did not match the tone of her voice,\nand the frilly blue apron tied round her waist belied the frostiness of\nher gray-green eyes. Nevertheless, her rancor was real. \"Sorry,\" he\nsaid. \"I didn't know your back yard was out of bounds.\" Then, \"If you'll\ngive me a list of the places you want evaluated, I'll get started right\naway.\"\n\n\"I'll take you around again personally--after we have breakfast.\"\n\nAgain he was consigned to the living room while she performed the\nnecessary culinary operations, and again she served him by tray. Clearly\nshe did not want him in the kitchen, or anywhere near it. He was not\nmuch of a one for mysteries, but this one was intriguing him more and\nmore by the minute.\n\nBreakfast over, she told him to wait on the front porch while she did\nthe dishes, and instructed Zarathustra to keep him company. She had two\nvoices: the one she used in addressing Zarathustra contained overtones\nof summer, and the one she used in addressing Philip contained\novertones of fall. \"Some day,\" Philip told the little dog, \"that chip\nshe carries on her shoulder is going to fall off of its own accord, and\nby then it will be too late--the way it was too late for me when I found\nout that the person I'd been running away from all my life was myself in\nwolf's clothing.\"\n\n\"Ruf,\" said Zarathustra, looking up at him with benign golden eyes.\n\"Ruf-ruf!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPresently Judith re-appeared, sans apron, and the three of them set\nforth into the golden October day. It was Philip's first experience in\nevaluating an entire village, but he had a knack for estimating the\nworth of property, and by the time noon came around, he had the job half\ndone. \"If you people had made even half an effort to keep your places\nup,\" he told Judith over cold-cut sandwiches and coffee in her living\nroom, \"we could have asked for a third again as much. Why in the world\ndid you let everything go to pot just because you were moving some place\nelse?\"\n\nShe shrugged. \"It's hard to get anyone to do housework these days--not\nto mention gardening. Besides, in addition to the servant problem,\nthere's another consideration--human nature. When you've lived in a\nshack all your life and you suddenly acquire a palace, you cease caring\nvery much what the shack looks like.\"\n\n\"Shack!\" Philip was indignant. \"Why, this house is lovely! Practically\nevery house you've shown me is lovely. Old, yes--but oldness is an\nessential part of the loveliness of houses. If Pfleugersville is on the\norder of most housing developments I've seen, you and your neighbors are\ngoing to be good and sorry one of these fine days!\"\n\n\"But Pfleugersville isn't on the order of most housing developments\nyou've seen. In fact, it's not a housing development at all. But let's\nnot go into that. Anyway, we're concerned with Valleyview, not\nPfleugersville.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" Philip said. \"This afternoon should wind things up so far\nas the appraising goes.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat evening, after a coffee-less supper--both the gas and the water had\nbeen turned off that afternoon--he totaled up his figures. They made\nquite a respectable sum. He looked across the coffee table, which he had\ncommandeered as a desk, to where Judith, with the dubious help of\nZarathustra, was sorting out a pile of manila envelopes which she had\nplaced in the middle of the living-room floor. \"I'll do my best to sell\neverything,\" he said, \"but it's going to be difficult going till we get\na few families living here. People are reluctant about moving into empty\nneighborhoods, and businessmen aren't keen about opening up business\nplaces before the customers are available. But I think it'll work out\nall right. There's a plaza not far from here that will provide a place\nto shop until the local markets are functioning, and Valleyview is part\nof a centralized school district.\" He slipped the paper he had been\nfiguring on into his brief case, closed the case and stood up. \"I'll\nkeep in touch with you.\"\n\nJudith shook her head. \"You'll do nothing of the sort. As soon as you\nleave, I'm moving to Pfleugersville. My business here is finished.\"\n\n\"I'll keep in touch with you there then. All you have to do is give me\nyour address and phone number.\"\n\nShe shook her head again. \"I could give you both, but neither would do\nyou any good. But that's beside the point. Valleyview is your\nresponsibility now--not mine.\"\n\nPhilip sat back down again. \"You can start explaining any time,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"It's very simple. The property owners of Valleyview signed all of their\nhouses and places of business over to me. I, in turn, have signed all of\nthem over to you--with the qualification, of course, that after selling\nthem you will be entitled to no more than your usual commission.\" She\nwithdrew a paper from one of the manila envelopes. \"After selling them,\"\nshe went on, \"you are to divide the proceeds equally among the four\ncharities specified in this contract.\" She handed him the paper. \"Do you\nunderstand now why I tried so hard to find a trustworthy agent?\"\n\nPhilip was staring at the paper, unable, in his astonishment, to read\nthe words it contained. \"Suppose,\" he said presently, \"that\ncircumstances should make it impossible for me to carry out my end of\nthe agreement?\"\n\n\"In case of illness, you will already have taken the necessary steps to\ntransfer the property to another agent who, in your opinion, is as\ncompletely honest as you are, and in case of death, you will already\nhave taken the necessary steps to bequeath the property to the same\nagent; and he, in both cases, will already have agreed to the terms laid\ndown in the contract you're holding in your hands. Why don't you read\nit?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNow that his astonishment had abated somewhat, Philip found that he\ncould do so. \"But this still doesn't make sense,\" he said a short while\nlater. \"Obviously you and the rest of the owners have purchased new\nhouses. Would it be presumptuous of me to ask how you're going to pay\nfor them when you're virtually giving your old houses away?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid it would be, Mr. Myles.\" She withdrew another paper from the\nenvelope and handed it to him. \"This is the other copy. If you'll kindly\naffix your signature to both, we can bring our business to a close. As\nyou'll notice, I've already signed.\"\n\n\"But if you're going to be incommunicado,\" Philip pointed out, anger\nbuilding up in him despite all he could do to stop it, \"what good will\nyour copy do you?\"\n\nJudith's countenance took on a glacial quality. So did her voice. \"My\ncopy will go into the hands of a trusted attorney, sealed in an envelope\nwhich I have already instructed him not to open till five years from\nthis date. If, at the time it is opened, you have violated the terms of\nour agreement, he will institute legal proceedings at once. Fortunately,\nalthough the Valleyview post office is closed, a mail truck passes\nthrough every weekday evening at eight. It's not that I don't trust you,\nMr. Myles--but you are a man, you know.\"\n\nPhilip was tempted to tear up the two copies then and there, and toss\nthe pieces into the air. But he didn't, for the very good reason that he\ncouldn't afford to. Instead, he bore down viciously on his pen and\nbrought his name to life twice in large and angry letters. He handed\nJudith one copy, slipped the other into his breast pocket and got to his\nfeet. \"That,\" he said, \"brings our official business to a close. Now I'd\nlike to add an unofficial word of advice. It seems to me that you're\nexacting an exorbitant price from the world for your husband's having\nsold you out for a brunette and a redhead and a pint of Scotch. I've\nbeen sold out lots of times for less than that, but I found out long ago\nthat the world doesn't pay its bills even when you ask a fair price for\nthe damages done to you. I suggest that you write the matter off as a\nbad debt and forget about it; then maybe you'll become a human being\nagain.\"\n\nShe had risen to her feet and was standing stiffly before him. She put\nhim in mind of an exquisite and fragile statue, and for a moment he had\nthe feeling that if he were to reach out and touch her, she would\nshatter into a million pieces. She did not move for some time, nor did\nhe; then she bent down, picked up three of the manila envelopes,\nstraightened, and handed them to him. \"Two of these contain the deeds,\nmaps and other records you will need,\" she said in a dead voice. \"The\nthird contains the keys to the houses and business places. Each key is\ntagged with the correct address. Good-by, Mr. Myles.\"\n\n\"Good-by,\" Philip said.\n\nHe looked around the room intending to say good-by to Zarathustra, but\nZarathustra was nowhere to be seen. Finally he went into the hall,\nopened the front door and stepped out into the night. A full moon was\nrising in the east. He walked down the moonlit walk, climbed into his\ncar and threw his brief case and the manila envelopes into the back\nseat. Soon, Valleyview was far behind him.\n\nBut not as far as it should have been. He couldn't get the green rose\nout of his mind. He couldn't get Judith Darrow out of his mind either.\nNor could he exorcise the summer breeze that kept wafting through the\ncrevices in his common sense.\n\nA green rose and a grass widow and a breeze with a green breath. A whole\ntown taking off for greener pastures....\n\nHe reached into his coat pocket and touched the rose. It was no more\nthan a stem and a handful of petals now, but its reality could not be\ndenied. But roses do not bloom in autumn, and green roses do not bloom\nat all--\n\n\"Ruf!\"\n\nHe had turned into the new highway some time ago, and was driving along\nit at a brisk sixty-five. Now, disbelievingly, he slowed, and pulled\nover onto the shoulder. Sure enough, he had a stowaway in the back\nseat--a tawny-haired stowaway with golden eyes, over-sized ears, and a\nrestless, white-tipped tail. \"Zarathustra!\" he gasped. \"How in the\ndickens did you get in there?\"\n\n\"Ruf,\" Zarathustra replied.\n\nPhilip groaned. Now he would have to go all the way back to Valleyview.\nNow he would have to see Judith Darrow again. Now he would have to--He\npaused in midthought, astonished at the abrupt acceleration of his\nheartbeat. \"Well I'll be damned!\" he said, and without further preamble\ntransferred Zarathustra to the front seat, U-turned, and started back.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe gasoline lantern had been moved out of the living-room window, but a\nlight still showed beyond the panes. He pulled over to the curb and\nturned off the ignition. He gave one of Zarathustra's over-sized ears a\nplayful tug, absently noting a series of small nodules along its lower\nextremity. \"Come on, Zarathustra,\" he said. \"I may as well deliver you\npersonally while I'm at it.\"\n\nAfter locking the car, he started up the walk, Zarathustra at his heels.\nHe knocked on the front door. Presently he knocked again. The door\ncreaked, swung partially open. He frowned. Had she forgotten to latch\nit? he wondered. Or had she deliberately left it unlatched so that\nZarathustra could get in? Zarathustra himself lent plausibility to the\nlatter conjecture by rising up on his hind legs and pushing the door the\nrest of the way open with his forepaws, after which he trotted into the\nhall and disappeared.\n\nPhilip pounded on the panels. \"Miss Darrow!\" he called. \"Judith!\"\n\nNo answer. He called again. Still no answer.\n\nA summer breeze came traipsing out of the house and engulfed him in the\nscent of roses. What kind of roses? he wondered. Green ones?\n\nHe stepped into the hall and closed the door behind him. He made his way\ninto the living room. The two chairs were gone, and so was the coffee\ntable. He walked through the living room and into the library; through\nthe library and into the dining room. The gasoline lantern burned\nbrightly on the dining-room table, its harsh white light bathing bare\nfloors and naked walls.\n\nThe breeze was stronger here, the scent of roses almost cloying. He saw\nthen that the double door that had thwarted him that morning was open,\nand he moved toward it across the room. As he had suspected, it gave\naccess to the kitchen. Pausing on the threshold, he peered inside. It\nwas an ordinary enough kitchen. Some of the appliances were gone, but\nthe stove and the refrigerator were still there. The back doorway had an\nodd bluish cast that caused the framework to shimmer. The door itself\nwas open, and he could see starlight lying softly on fields and trees.\n\nWonderingly he walked across the room and stepped outside. There was a\nfaint sputtering sound, as though live wires had been crossed, and for a\nfleeting second the scene before him seemed to waver. Then, abruptly, it\ngrew still.\n\nHe grew still, too--immobile in the strange, yet peaceful, summer night.\nHe was standing on a grassy plain, and the plain spread out on either\nhand to promontories of little trees. Before him, the land sloped gently\nupward, and was covered with multicolored flowers that twinkled like\nmicrocosmic stars. In the distance, the lights of a village showed. To\nhis right, a riotous green-rose bush bloomed, and beneath it Zarathustra\nsat, wagging his tail.\n\nPhilip took two steps forward, stopped and looked up at the sky. It was\nwrong somehow. For one thing, Cassiopeia had changed position, and for\nanother, Orion was awry. For still another, there were no clouds for the\nmoon to hide behind, and yet the moon had disappeared.\n\nZarathustra trotted over to where he was standing, gazed up at him with\ngolden eyes, then headed in the direction of the lights. Philip took a\ndeep breath, and followed him. He would have visited the village anyway,\nZarathustra or no Zarathustra. Was it Pfleugersville? He knew suddenly\nthat it was.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe had not gone far before he saw a highway. A pair of headlights\nappeared suddenly in the direction of the village and resolved rapidly\ninto a moving van. To his consternation, the van turned off the\nthoroughfare and headed in his direction. He ducked into a coppice,\nZarathustra at his heels, and watched the heavy vehicle bounce by. There\nwere two men in the cab, and painted on the paneling of the truckbed\nwere the words, PFLEUGERSVILLE MOVERS, INC.\n\nThe van continued on in the direction from which he had come, and\npresently he guessed its destination. Judith, clearly, was in the midst\nof moving out the furniture she had been too sentimental to sell. The\nonly trouble was, her house had disappeared. So had the village of\nValleyview.\n\nHe stared at where the houses should have been, saw nothing at first\nexcept a continuation of the starlit plain. Then he noticed an upright\nrectangle of pale light hovering just above the ground, and presently he\nidentified it as Judith's back doorway. He could see through it into the\nkitchen, and by straining his eyes, he could even see the stove and the\nrefrigerator.\n\nGradually he made out other upright rectangles hovering just above the\nground, some of them on a line with Judith's. All of them, however,\nwhile outlined in the same shimmering blue that outlined hers, lacked\nlighted interiors.\n\nAs he stood there staring, the van came to a halt, turned around and\nbacked up to the brightest rectangle, hiding it from view. The two men\ngot out of the cab and walked around to the rear of the truckbed. \"We'll\nput the stove on first,\" Philip heard one of them say. And then, \"Wonder\nwhy she wants to hang onto junk like this?\"\n\nThe other man's voice was fainter, but his words were unmistakable\nenough: \"Grass widows who turn into old maids have funny notions\nsometimes.\"\n\nJudith Darrow wasn't really moving out of Valleyview after all. She only\nthought she was.\n\nPhilip went on. The breeze was all around him. It blew through his hair,\nkissed his cheeks and caressed his forehead. The stars shone palely\ndown. Some of the land was under cultivation, and he could see green\nthings growing in the starlight, and the breeze carried their green\nbreath to his nostrils. He reached the highway and began walking along\nit. He saw no further sign of vehicles till he came opposite a large\nbrick building with bright light spilling through its windows. In front\nof it were parked a dozen automobiles of a make that he was unfamiliar\nwith.\n\nHe heard the whir of machinery and the pounding of hammers, and he went\nover and peered through one of the windows. The building proved to be a\nfurniture factory. Most of the work was being done by machines, but\nthere were enough tasks left over to keep the owners of the parked cars\nbusily occupied. The main manual task was upholstering. The machines cut\nand sewed and trimmed and planed and doweled and assembled, but\napparently none of them was up to the fine art of spitting tacks.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPhilip returned to the highway and went on. He came to other buildings\nand peered into each. One was a small automobile-assembly plant, another\nwas a dairy, a third was a long greenhouse. In the first two the\npreponderance of the work was being performed by machines. In the third,\nhowever, machines were conspicuously absent. Clearly it was one thing\nto build a machine with a superhuman work potential, but quite another\nto build one with a green thumb.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nHe passed a pasture, and saw animals that looked like cows sleeping in\nthe starlight. He passed a field of newly-sprouted corn. He passed a\npower plant, and heard the whine of a generator. Finally he came to the\noutskirts of Pfleugersville.\n\nThere was a big illuminated sign by the side of the road. It stopped him\nin his tracks, and he stood there staring at its embossed letters:\n\n    PFLEUGERSVILLE, SIRIUS XXI\n    _Discovered April 1, 1962\n    Incorporated September 11, 1962_\n\nPhilip wiped his forehead.\n\nZarathustra had trotted on ahead. Now he stopped and looked back. _Come\non_, he seemed to say. _Now that you've seen this much, you might as\nwell see the rest._\n\nSo Philip entered Pfleugersville ... and fell in love--\n\nFell in love with the lovely houses, and the darling trees in summer\nbloom. With the parterres of twinkling star-flowers and the expanses of\nverdant lawns. With the trellised green roses that tapestried every\nporch. With the hydrangealike blooms that garnished every corner. With\nPfleugersville itself.\n\nObviously the hour was late, for, other than himself, there was no one\non the streets, although lights burned in the windows of some of the\nhouses, and dogs of the same breed and size as Zarathustra occasionally\ntrotted by. And yet according to his watch the time was 10:51. Maybe,\nthough, Pfleugersville was on different time. Maybe, here in\nPfleugersville, it was the middle of the night.\n\nThe farther he progressed into the village, the more enchanted he\nbecame. He simply couldn't get over the houses. The difference between\nthem and the houses he was familiar with was subtle, but it was there.\nIt was the difference that exists between good- and not-quite-good\ntaste. Here were no standardized patios, but little marble aprons that\nwere as much a part of the over-all architecture as a glen is a part of\na woods. Here were no stereotyped picture windows, but walls that\nblended imperceptibly into pleasing patterns of transparency. Here were\nno four-square back yards, but rambling star-flowered playgrounds with\nswings and seesaws and shaded swimming holes; with exquisite doghouses\ngood enough for little girls' dolls to live in.\n\nHe passed a school that seemed to grow out of the very ground it stood\non. He passed a library that had been built around a huge tree, the\nbranches of which had intertwined their foliage into a living roof. He\npassed a block-long supermarket built of tinted glass. Finally he came\nto the park.\n\nHe gasped then. Gasped at the delicate trees and the little blue-eyed\nlakes; at the fairy-fountains and the winding, pebbled paths.\nStar-flowers shed their multicolored radiance everywhere, and starlight\npoured prodigally down from the sky. He chose a path at random and\nwalked along it in the twofold radiance till he came to the cynosure.\n\nThe cynosure was a statue--a statue of a buck-toothed, wall-eyed youth\ngazing steadfastly up into the heavens. In one hand the youth held a\nPhillips screw driver, in the other a six-inch crescent wrench. Standing\nseveral yards away and staring raptly up into the statue's face was the\nyouth himself, and so immobile was he that if it hadn't been for the\npedestal on which the statue rested, Philip would have been unable to\ndistinguish one from the other.\n\nThere was an inscription on the pedestal. He walked over and read it in\nthe light cast by a nearby parterre of star-flowers:\n\n    FRANCIS FARNSWORTH\n    PFLEUGER,\n    DISCOVERER OF\n    PFLEUGERSVILLE\n\n    _Born: May 5. 1941. Died: ----_\n\n    _Profession Inventor. On the first day of April of the year of our\n    Lord, 1962, Francis Farnsworth Pfleuger brought into being a M\u00f6bius\n    coincidence field and established multiple contact with the\n    twenty-first satellite of the star Sirius, thereby giving the\n    people of Valleyview access, via their back doorways, to a New\n    World. Here we have come to live. Here we have come to raise our\n    children. Here, in this idyllic village, which the noble race that\n    once inhabited this fair planet left behind them when they migrated\n    to the Greater Magellanic Cloud, we have settled down to create a\n    new and better Way of Life. Here, thanks to Francis Farnsworth\n    Pfleuger, we shall know happiness prosperity and freedom from fear._\n\n    FRANCIS FARNSWORTH PFLEUGER, WE, THE NEW INHABITANTS OF SIRIUS XXI,\n    SALUTE YOU!\n\nPhilip wiped his forehead again.\n\nPresently he noticed that the flesh-and-blood Francis Pfleuger was\nlooking in his direction. \"Me,\" the flesh-and-blood Francis Pfleuger\nsaid, pointing proudly at the statue. \"Me.\"\n\n\"So I gather,\" Philip said dryly. And then. \"Zarathustra--come back\nhere!\"\n\nThe little dog had started down one of the paths that converged on the\nstatue. At Philip's command, he stopped but did not turn; instead he\nremained where he was, as though waiting for someone to come down the\npath. After a moment, someone did--Judith Darrow.\n\nShe was wearing a simple white dress, reminiscent both in design and\nd\u00e9cor of a Grecian tunic. A wide gilt belt augmented the effect, and her\ndelicate sandals did nothing to mar it. In the radiance of the\nstar-flowers, her eyes were more gray than green. There were shadows\nunder them, Philip noticed, and the lids were faintly red.\n\nShe halted a few feet from him and looked at him without saying a word.\n\"I ... I brought your dog back,\" he said lamely. \"I found him in the\nback seat of my car.\"\n\n\"Thank you. I've been looking all over Pfleugersville for him. I left my\nValleyview doors open, hoping he'd come home of his own accord, but I\nguess he had other ideas. Now that you've discovered our secret, Mr.\nMyles, what do you think of our brave new world?\"\n\n\"I think it's lovely,\" Philip said, \"but I don't believe it's where you\nseem to think it is.\"\n\n\"Don't you?\" she asked. \"Then suppose you show me the full moon that\nrose over Valleyview tonight. Or better yet, suppose I show you\nsomething else.\" She pointed to a region of the heavens just to the left\nof the statue's turned-up nose. \"You can't see them from here,\" she\nsaid, \"but around that insignificant yellow star, nine planets are in\norbit. One of them is Earth.\"\n\n\"But that's impossible!\" he objected. \"Consider the--\"\n\n\"Distance? In the sort of space we're dealing with, Mr. Myles, distance\nis not a factor. In M\u00f6bius space--as we have come to call it for lack\nof a better term--any two given points are coincidental, regardless of\nhow far apart they may be in non-M\u00f6bius space. But this becomes manifest\nonly when a M\u00f6bius coincidence-field is established. As you probably\nknow by now, Francis Pfleuger created such a field.\"\n\nAt the mention of his name, Francis Pfleuger came hurrying over to where\nthey were standing. \"E,\" he declared, \"equals mc\u00b2.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Francis,\" Judith said. Then, to Philip, \"Shall we walk?\"\n\nThey started down one of the converging paths, Zarathustra bringing up\nthe rear. Behind them, Francis returned to his Narcissistic study of\nhimself in stone. \"We were neighbors back in Valleyview,\" Judith said,\n\"but I never dreamed he thought quite so much of himself. Ever since we\nput up that statue last week, he's been staring at it night and day.\nSometimes he even brings his lunch with him.\"\n\n\"He seems to be familiar with Einstein.\"\n\n\"He's not really, though. He memorized the energy-mass equation in an\nattempt to justify his new status in life, but he hasn't the remotest\nnotion of what it means. It's ironic in a way that Pfleugersville should\nhave been discovered by someone with an IQ of less than seventy-five.\"\n\n\"No one with an IQ of less than seventy-five could create the sort of\nfield you were talking about.\"\n\n\"He didn't create it deliberately--he brought it into being accidentally\nby means of a machine he was building to tie knots with. Or at least\nthat's what he says. But we do know that there was such a machine\nbecause we saw its fused parts in his kitchen, and there's no question\nbut what it was the source of the field. Francis, though, can't remember\nhow he made the parts or how he put them together. As a matter of fact,\nto this day he still doesn't understand what happened--though I have a\nfeeling that he knows more than he lets on.\"\n\n\"What _did_ happen?\" Philip asked.\n\nFor a while Judith was silent. Then, \"All of us promised solemnly not to\ndivulge our secret to an outsider unless he was first accepted by the\ngroup as a whole,\" she said. \"But thanks to my negligence, you know most\nof it already, so I suppose you're entitled to know the rest.\" She\nsighed. \"Very well--I'll try to explain....\"\n\nWhen Francis Pfleuger's field had come into being, something had\nhappened to the back doors of Valleyview that caused them to open upon a\nplanet which one of the local star-gazers promptly identified as Sirius\nXXI. The good folk of Valleyview had no idea of how such a state of\naffairs could exist, to say nothing of how it could have come about,\ntill one of the scientists whom they asked to join them as a part of the\nplan which they presently devised to make their forthcoming utopia\nself-sufficient, came up with a theory that explained everything.\n\nAccording to his theory, the round-trip distance between any two\nplanetary or \u00b2stella bodies was curved in the manner of a M\u00f6bius\nstrip--i.e., a strip of paper given a half-twist before bringing the two\nends together. In this case, the strip represented the round-trip\ndistance from Earth to Sirius XXI. Earth was represented on the strip by\none dot, and Sirius XXI by another, and, quite naturally, the two dots\nwere an equal distance--or approximately 8.8 light years--apart. This\nbrought them directly opposite one another--one on one side of the\nstrip, the other on the other side; but since a M\u00f6bius strip has only\none surface--or side--the two dots were actually occupying the same\nspace at the same time. In \"M\u00f6bius space\", then, Earth and Sirius XXI\nwere \"coincidental\".\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPhilip looked over his shoulder at the little yellow sun twinkling in\nthe sky. \"Common sense,\" he said, \"tells me differently.\"\n\n\"Common sense is a liar of the first magnitude,\" Judith said. \"It has\nmisled man ever since he first climbed down from the trees. It was\ncommon sense that inspired Ptolemy's theory of cosmogony. It was common\nsense that inspired the burning of Giordano Bruno....\"\n\nThe fact that common sense indicated that 8.8 light years separated\nEarth and Sirius XXI in common-sense reality didn't prove that 8.8 light\nyears separated them in a form of reality that was outside\ncommon-sense's dominion--i.e., M\u00f6bius space--and Francis Pfleuger's\nfield had demonstrated as much. The back-door nodal areas which it had\nestablished, however, were merely limited manifestations of that\nreality--in other words, the field had merely provided limited access to\na form of space that had been in existence all along.\n\n\"Though why,\" Judith concluded, \"our back doors should have been\naffected rather than our front doors, for example, is\ninexplicable--unless it was because Francis built the machine in his\nkitchen. In any event, when they did become nodal areas, they manifested\nthemselves on Sirius XXI, and the dogs in the immediate vicinity\nassociated them with the doorways of their departed masters and began\nwhining to be let in.\"\n\n\"Their departed masters?\"\n\n\"The race that built this village. The race that built the factories and\ndeveloped the encompassing farms. A year ago, according to the records\nthey left behind them, they migrated to the Greater Magellanic Cloud.\"\n\nPhilip was indignant. \"Why didn't they take their dogs with them?\"\n\n\"They couldn't. After all, they had to leave their cars and their\nfurniture behind them too, not to mention almost unbelievable\nstockpiles of every metal imaginable that will last us for centuries.\nThe logistics of space travel make taking even an extra handkerchief\nalong a calculated risk. Anyway, when their dogs 'found' us, they were\noverjoyed, and as for us, we fell in love with them at first sight. Our\nown dogs, though, didn't take to them at all, and every one of them ran\naway.\"\n\n\"This can't be the only village,\" Philip said. \"There must be others\nsomewhere.\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly there are. All we know is that the people who built this\none were the last to leave.\"\n\nThe park was behind them now, and they were walking down a pleasant\nstreet. \"And when you and your neighbors discovered the village, did you\ndecide to become expatriates right then and there?\" Philip asked.\n\nShe nodded. \"Do you blame us? You've seen for yourself what a lovely\nplace it is. But it's far more than that. In Valleyview, we had\nunemployment. Here, there is work for everyone, and a corresponding\nfeeling of wantedness and togetherness. True, most of the work is\nfarmwork, but what of that? We have every conceivable kind of machine to\nhelp us in our tasks. Indeed, I think that the only machine the Sirians\nlacked was one that could manufacture food out of whole cloth. But\nconsider the most important advantage of all: when we go to bed at night\nwe can do so without being afraid that sometime during our sleep a\nthermonuclear missile will descend out of the sky and devour us in one\nhuge incandescent bite. If we've made a culture hero out of our village\nidiot, it's no more than right, for unwittingly or not, he opened up the\ngates of paradise.\"\n\n\"And you immediately saw to it that no one besides yourselves and a\nchosen few would pass through them.\"\n\nJudith paused beside a white gate. \"Yes, that's true,\" she said. \"To\nkeep our secret, we lived in our old houses while we were settling our\naffairs, closing down our few industries and setting up a new monetary\nsystem. In fact, we even kept our ... the children in the dark for fear\nthat they would talk at school. Suppose, however, we _had_ publicized\nour utopia. Can't you imagine the mockery opportunists would have made\nout of it? The village we found was large enough to accommodate\nourselves and the few friends, relatives and specialists we asked to\njoin us, but no larger; and we did, after all, find it in our own back\nyard.\" She placed her hand on the white gate. \"This is where I live.\"\n\nHe looked at the house, and it was enchanting. Slightly less enchanting,\nbut delightful in its own right, was the much smaller house beside it.\nJudith pointed toward the latter dwelling and looked at Zarathustra.\n\"It's almost morning, Zarathustra,\" she said sternly. \"Go to bed this\nminute!\" She opened the gate so that the little dog could pass through\nand raised her eyes to Philip. \"Our time is different here,\" she\nexplained. And then, \"I'm afraid you'll have to hurry if you expect to\nmake it to my back door before the field dies out.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nHe felt suddenly empty. \"Dies out?\" he repeated numbly.\n\n\"Yes. We don't know why, but it's been diminishing in strength ever\nsince it first came into being, and our 'M\u00f6bius-strip scientist' has\npredicted that it will cease to exist during the next twenty-four hours.\nI guess I don't need to remind you that you have important business on\nEarth.\"\n\n\"No,\" he said, \"I guess you don't.\" His emptiness bowed out before a\nwave of bitterness. He had rested his hand on the gate, as close to hers\nas he had dared. Now he saw that while it was inches away from hers in\none sense, it was light years away in another. He removed it angrily.\n\"Business always comes first with you, doesn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes. Business never lets you down.\"\n\n\"Do you know what I think?\" Philip said. \"I think that you were the one\nwho did the selling out, not your husband. I think you sold him out for\na law practice.\"\n\nHer face turned white as though he had slapped it, and in a sense, he\nhad. \"Good-by,\" she said, and this time he was certain that if he were\nto reach out and touch her, she would shatter into a million pieces.\n\"Give my love to the planet Earth,\" she added icily.\n\n\"Good-by,\" Philip said, his anger gone now, and the emptiness rushing\nback. \"Don't sell us short, though--we'll make a big splash in your sky\none of these days when we blow ourselves up.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nHe turned and walked away. Walked out of the enchanting village and down\nthe highway and across the flower-pulsing plain to Judith's back\ndoorway. It was unlighted now, and he had trouble distinguishing it from\nthe others. Its shimmering blue framework was flickering. Judith had not\nlied then: the field was dying out.\n\nHe locked the back door behind him, walked sadly through the dark and\nempty house and let himself out the front door. He locked the front door\nbehind him, too, and went down the walk and climbed into his car. He had\nthought he had locked it, but apparently he hadn't. He drove out of town\nand down the road to the highway, and down the highway toward the big\nbright bonfire of the city.\n\nDawn was exploring the eastern sky with pale pink fingers when at last\nhe parked his car in the garage behind his apartment building. He\nreached into the back seat for his brief case and the manila envelopes.\nHis brief case had hair on it. It was soft and warm. \"Ruf,\" it barked.\n\"Ruf-ruf!\"\n\nHe knew then that everything was all right. Just because no one had\ninvited him to the party didn't mean that he couldn't invite himself. He\nwould have to hurry, though--he had a lot of things to do, and time was\nrunning out.\n\nNoon found him on the highway again, his business transacted, his\naffairs settled, Zarathustra sitting beside him on the seat. One o'clock\nfound him driving into Valleyview; two-five found him turning down a\nfamiliar street. He would have to leave his car behind him, but that was\nall right. Leaving it to rust away in a ghost town was better than\nselling it to some opportunistic dealer for a sum he would have no use\nfor anyway. He parked it by the curb, and after getting his suitcase out\nof the trunk, walked up to the front door of Number 23. He unlocked and\nopened the door, and after Zarathustra followed him inside, closed and\nlocked it behind him. He strode through the house to the kitchen. He\nunlocked and opened the back door. He stepped eagerly across the\nthreshold--and stopped dead still.\n\nThere were boards beneath his feet instead of grass. Instead of a\nflower-pied plain, he saw a series of unkempt back yards. Beside him on\nan unpainted trellis, Virginia creeper rattled in an October wind.\n\nZarathustra came out behind him, descended the back-porch steps and ran\naround the side of the house. Looking for the green-rose bush probably.\n\n\"Ruf!\"\n\nZarathustra had returned and was looking up at him from the bottom step.\nOn the top step he had placed an offering.\n\nThe offering was a green rose.\n\nPhilip bent down and picked it up. It was fresh, and its fragrance\nepitomized the very essence of Sirius XXI. \"Zarathustra,\" he gasped,\n\"where did you get it?\"\n\n\"Ruf!\" said Zarathustra, and ran around the side of the house.\n\nPhilip followed, rounded the corner just in time to see the white-tipped\ntail disappear into the ancient dog house. Disappointment numbed him.\nThat was where the rose had been then--stored away for safe-keeping like\nan old and worthless bone.\n\nBut the rose was fresh, he reminded himself.\n\nDid dog houses have back doorways?\n\nThis one did, he saw, kneeling down and peering inside. A lovely back\ndoorway, rimmed with shimmering blue. It framed a familiar vista, in the\nforeground of which a familiar green-rosebush stood. Beneath the\nrosebush Zarathustra sat, wagging his tail.\n\nIt was a tight squeeze, but Philip made it. He even managed to get his\nsuitcase through. And just in time too, for hardly had he done so when\nthe doorway began to flicker. Now it was on its way out, and as he\nwatched, it faded into transparency and disappeared.\n\nHe crawled from beneath the rosebush and stood up. The day was bright\nand warm, and the position of the sun indicated early morning or late\nafternoon. No, not sun--suns. One of them was a brilliant blue-white\norb, the other a twinkling point of light.\n\nHe set off across the plain in Zarathustra's wake. He had a speech\nalready prepared, and when Judith met him at the gate with wide and\nwondering eyes, he delivered it without preamble. \"Judith,\" he said, \"I\nam contemptuous of the notion that some things are meant to be and\nothers aren't, and I firmly believe in my own free will; but when your\ndog stows away in the back seat of my car two times running and makes\nit impossible for me not to see you again, then there must be something\nafoot which neither you nor I can do a thing about. Whatever it is, I\nhave given in to it and have transferred your real estate to an agent\nmore trustworthy than myself. I know you haven't known me long, and I\nknow I'm not an accepted member of your group, but maybe somebody will\ngive me a job raking lawns or washing windows or hoeing corn long enough\nfor me to prove that I am not in the least antisocial; and maybe, in\ntime, you yourself will get to know me well enough to realize that while\nI have a weakness for blondes who look like Grecian goddesses, I have no\ntaste whatever for redheads, brunettes, or Cutty Sark. In any event, I\nhave burned my bridges behind me, and whether I ever become a resident\nof Pfleugersville or not, I have already become a resident of Sirius\nXXI.\"\n\nJudith Darrow was silent for some time. Then, \"This morning,\" she said,\n\"I wanted to ask you to join us, but I couldn't for two reasons. The\nfirst was your commitment to sell our houses, the second was my\nbitterness toward men. You have eliminated the first, and the second\nseems suddenly inane.\" She raised her eyes. \"Philip, please join us. I\nwant you to.\"\n\nZarathustra, whose real name was Siddenon Phenphonderill, left them\nstanding there in each other's arms and trotted down the street and out\nof town. He covered the ground in easy lopes that belied his three\nhundred and twenty-five years, and soon he arrived at the Meeting Place.\nThe mayors of the other villages had been awaiting him since early\nmorning and were shifting impatiently on their haunches. When he\nclambered up on the rostrum they extended their audio-appendages and\nretractile fingers and accorded him a round of applause. He extended his\nown \"hands\" and held them up for silence, then, retracting them again,\nhe seated himself before the little lectern and began his report, the\nidiomatic translation of which follows forthwith:\n\n\"Gentlemen, my apologies for my late arrival. I will touch upon the\ncircumstances that were responsible for it presently.\n\n\"To get down to the matter uppermost in your minds: Yes, the experiment\nwas a success, and if you will use your psycho-transmutative powers to\nremodel your villages along the lines my constituents and I remodeled\nours and to build enough factories to give your 'masters' that sense of\nself-sufficiency so essential to their well-being, and if you will\n'plant' your disassembled Multiple M\u00f6bius-Knot Dynamos in such a way\nthat the resultant fields will be ascribed to accidental causes, you\nwill have no more trouble attracting personnel than we did. Just make\nsure that your 'masters' quarters are superior to your own, and that\nyou behave like dogs in their presence. And when you fabricate your\nrecords concerning your mythical departed masters, see to it that they\ndo not conflict with the records we fabricated concerning ours. It would\nbe desirable indeed if our Sirian-human society could be based on less\ndeceitful grounds than these, but the very human attitude we are\nexploiting renders this impossible at the moment. I hate to think of the\nresentment we would incur were we to reveal that, far from being the\nmere dogs we seem to be, we are capable of mentally transmuting natural\nresources into virtually anything from a key to a concert hall, and I\nhate even more to think of the resentment we would incur were we to\nreveal that, for all our ability in the inanimate field, we have never\nbeen able to materialize so much as a single blade of grass in the\nanimate field, and that our reason for coincidentalizing the planet\nEarth and creating our irresistible little utopias stems not from a need\nfor companionship but from a need for gardeners. However, you will find\nthat all of this can be ironed out eventually through the human\nchildren, with whom you will be thrown into daily contact and whom you\nwill find to possess all of their parents' abiding love for us and none\nof their parents' superior attitude toward us. To a little child, a dog\nis a companion, not a pet; an equal, not an inferior--and the little\nchildren of today will be the grown-ups of tomorrow.\n\n\"To return to the circumstances that occasioned my late arrival: I ... I\nmust confess, gentlemen, that I became quite attached to the 'mistress'\ninto whose house I sought entry when we first established our field and\nwho subsequently adopted me when I convinced her real dog that he would\nfind greener pastures elsewhere. So greatly attached did I become, in\nfact, that when the opportunity of ostracizing her loneliness presented\nitself, I could not refrain from taking advantage of it. The person to\nwhom she was most suited and who was most suited to her appeared\nvirtually upon her very doorstep; but in her stubbornness and in her\npride she aggravated rather than encouraged him, causing him to rebel\nagainst the natural attraction he felt toward her. I am happy to report\nthat, by means of a number of subterfuges--the final one of which\nnecessitated the use of our original doorway--I was able to set this\nmatter right, and that these two once-lonely people are about to embark\nupon a relationship which in their folklore is oftentimes quaintly\nalluded to by the words, 'They lived happily ever after.'\n\n\"And now, gentlemen, the best of luck to you and your constituents, and\nmay you end up with servants as excellent as ours. I hereby declare this\nmeeting adjourned.\"\n\n\nTRANSCRIBER'S NOTE:\n\nThis etext was produced from \"Analog Science Fact Science Fiction\"\nNovember 1962.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
