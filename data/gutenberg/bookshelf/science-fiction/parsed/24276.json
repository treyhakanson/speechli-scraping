Nourse\n\n\nWhen the discovery was announced, it was Dr. Chauncey Patrick Coffin who\nannounced it. He had, of course, arranged with uncanny skill to take\nmost of the credit for himself. If it turned out to be greater than he\nhad hoped, so much the better. His presentation was scheduled for the\nlast night of the American College of Clinical Practitioners' annual\nmeeting, and Coffin had fully intended it to be a bombshell.\n\nIt was. Its explosion exceeded even Dr. Coffin's wilder expectations,\nwhich took quite a bit of doing. In the end he had waded through more\nnewspaper reporters than medical doctors as he left the hall that night.\nIt was a heady evening for Chauncey Patrick Coffin, M.D.\n\nCertain others were not so delighted with Coffin's bombshell.\n\n\"It's idiocy!\" young Dr. Phillip Dawson wailed in the laboratory\nconference room the next morning. \"Blind, screaming idiocy. You've gone\nout of your mind--that's all there is to it. Can't you see what you've\ndone? Aside from selling your colleagues down the river, that is?\" He\nclenched the reprint of Coffin's address in his hand and brandished it\nlike a broadsword. \"'Report on a Vaccine for the Treatment and Cure of\nthe Common Cold,' by C. P. Coffin, _et al._ That's what it says--_et\nal._ My idea in the first place. Jake and I both pounding our heads on\nthe wall for eight solid months--and now you sneak it into publication a\nfull year before we have any business publishing a word about it.\"\n\n\"Really, Phillip!\" Dr. Chauncey Coffin ran a pudgy hand through his\nsnowy hair. \"How ungrateful! I thought for sure you'd be delighted. An\nexcellent presentation, I must say--terse, succinct, unequivocal--\" he\nraised his hand--\"but _generously_ unequivocal, you understand. You\nshould have heard the ovation--they nearly went wild! And the look on\nUnderwood's face! Worth waiting twenty years for.\"\n\n\"And the reporters,\" snapped Phillip. \"Don't forget the reporters.\" He\nwhirled on the small dark man sitting quietly in the corner. \"How about\nthat, Jake? Did you see the morning papers? This thief not only steals\nour work, he splashes it all over the countryside in red ink.\"\n\nDr. Jacob Miles coughed apologetically. \"What Phillip is so stormed up\nabout is the prematurity of it all,\" he said to Coffin. \"After all,\nwe've hardly had an acceptable period of clinical trial.\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" said Coffin, glaring at Phillip. \"Underwood and his men were\nready to publish their discovery within another six weeks. Where would\nwe be then? How much clinical testing do you want? Phillip, you had the\nworst cold of your life when you took the vaccine. Have you had any\nsince?\"\n\n\"No, of course not,\" said Phillip peevishly.\n\n\"Jacob, how about you? Any sniffles?\"\n\n\"Oh, no. No colds.\"\n\n\"Well, what about those six hundred students from the University? Did I\nmisread the reports on them?\"\n\n\"No--98 per cent cured of active symptoms within twenty-four hours. Not\na single recurrence. The results were just short of miraculous.\" Jake\nhesitated. \"Of course, it's only been a month....\"\n\n\"Month, year, century! Look at them! Six hundred of the world's most\nluxuriant colds, and now not even a sniffle.\" The chubby doctor sank\ndown behind the desk, his ruddy face beaming. \"Come, now, gentlemen, be\nreasonable. Think positively! There's work to be done, a great deal of\nwork. They'll be wanting me in Washington, I imagine. Press conference\nin twenty minutes. Drug houses to consult with. How dare we stand in the\npath of Progress? We've won the greatest medical triumph of all\ntimes--the conquering of the Common Cold. We'll go down in history!\"\n\nAnd he was perfectly right on one point, at least.\n\nThey did go down in history.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe public response to the vaccine was little less than monumental. Of\nall the ailments that have tormented mankind through history none was\never more universal, more tenacious, more uniformly miserable than the\ncommon cold. It was a respecter of no barriers, boundaries, or classes;\nambassadors and chambermaids snuffled and sneezed in drippy-nosed\nunanimity. The powers in the Kremlin sniffed and blew and wept genuine\ntears on drafty days, while senatorial debates on earth-shaking issues\npaused reverently upon the unplugging of a nose, the clearing of a\nrhinorrheic throat. Other illnesses brought disability, even death in\ntheir wake; the common cold merely brought torment to the millions as it\nimplacably resisted the most superhuman of efforts to curb it.\n\nUntil that chill, rainy November day when the tidings broke to the world\nin four-inch banner heads:\n\n        COFFIN NAILS LID ON COMMON COLD\n\n  \"No More Coughin'\" States Co-Finder of Cure\n\n SNIFFLES SNIPED: SINGLE SHOT TO SAVE SNEEZERS\n\nIn medical circles it was called the Coffin Multicentric Upper\nRespiratory Virus-Inhibiting Vaccine; but the papers could never stand\nfor such high-sounding names, and called it, simply, \"The Coffin Cure.\"\n\nBelow the banner heads, world-renowned feature writers expounded in\nreverent terms the story of the leviathan struggle of Dr. Chauncey\nPatrick Coffin (_et al._) in solving this riddle of the ages: how, after\nyears of failure, they ultimately succeeded in culturing the causative\nagent of the common cold, identifying it not as a single virus or group\nof viruses, but as a multicentric virus complex invading the soft mucous\nlinings of the nose, throat and eyes, capable of altering its basic\nmolecular structure at any time to resist efforts of the body from\nwithin, or the physician from without, to attack and dispel it; how the\nhypothesis was set forth by Dr. Phillip Dawson that the virus could be\ndestroyed only by an antibody which could \"freeze\" the virus-complex in\none form long enough for normal body defenses to dispose of the\noffending invader; the exhausting search for such a \"crippling agent,\"\nand the final crowning success after injecting untold gallons of\ncold-virus material into the hides of a group of co-operative and\nforbearing dogs (a species which never suffered from colds, and hence\nendured the whole business with an air of affectionate boredom).\n\nAnd finally, the testing. First, Coffin himself (who was suffering a\nparticularly horrendous case of the affliction he sought to cure); then\nhis assistants Phillip Dawson and Jacob Miles; then a multitude of\nstudents from the University--carefully chosen for the severity of their\nsymptoms, the longevity of their colds, their tendency to acquire them\non little or no provocation, and their utter inability to get rid of\nthem with any known medical program.\n\nThey were a sorry spectacle, those students filing through the Coffin\nlaboratory for three days in October: wheezing like steam shovels,\nsnorting and sneezing and sniffling and blowing, coughing and squeaking,\nmute appeals glowing in their blood-shot eyes. The researchers dispensed\nthe materials--a single shot in the right arm, a sensitivity control in\nthe left.\n\nWith growing delight they then watched as the results came in. The\nsneezing stopped; the sniffling ceased. A great silence settled over the\ncampus, in the classrooms, in the library, in classic halls. Dr.\nCoffin's voice returned (rather to the regret of his fellow workers) and\nhe began bouncing about the laboratory like a small boy at a fair.\nStudents by the dozen trooped in for checkups with noses dry and eyes\nbright.\n\nIn a matter of days there was no doubt left that the goal had been\nreached.\n\n\"But we have to be _sure_,\" Phillip Dawson had cried cautiously. \"This\nwas only a pilot test. We need mass testing now, on an entire community.\nWe should go to the West Coast and run studies there--they have a\ndifferent breed of cold out there, I hear. We'll have to see how long\nthe immunity lasts, make sure there are no unexpected side effects....\"\nAnd, muttering to himself, he fell to work with pad and pencil,\ncalculating the program to be undertaken before publication.\n\nBut there were rumors. Underwood at Stanford, they said, had already\ncompleted his tests and was preparing a paper for publication in a\nmatter of months. Surely with such dramatic results on the pilot tests\n_something_ could be put into print. It would be tragic to lose the race\nfor the sake of a little unnecessary caution....\n\nPeter Dawson was adamant, but he was a voice crying in the wilderness.\nChauncey Patrick Coffin was boss.\n\nWithin a week even Coffin was wondering if he had bitten off just a\ntrifle too much. They had expected that demand for the vaccine would be\ngreat--but even the grisly memory of the early days of the Salk vaccine\nhad not prepared them for the mobs of sneezing, wheezing red-eyed people\nbombarding them for the first fruits.\n\nClear-eyed young men from the Government Bureau pushed through crowds of\nlocal townspeople, lining the streets outside the Coffin laboratory,\nstanding in pouring rain to raise insistent placards.\n\nSeventeen pharmaceutical houses descended like vultures with production\nplans, cost-estimates, colorful graphs demonstrating proposed yield and\ndistribution programs. Coffin was flown to Washington, where conferences\nlabored far into the night as demands pounded their doors like a tidal\nwave.\n\nOne laboratory promised the vaccine in ten days; another said a week.\nThe first actually appeared in three weeks and two days, to be soaked up\nin the space of three hours by the thirsty sponge of cold-weary\nhumanity. Express planes were dispatched to Europe, to Asia, to Africa\nwith the precious cargo, a million needles pierced a million hides, and\nwith a huge, convulsive sneeze mankind stepped forth into a new era.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere were abstainers, of course. There always are.\n\n\"It doesn't bake eddy differets how much you talk,\" Ellie Dawson cried\nhoarsely, shaking her blonde curls. \"I dod't wadt eddy cold shots.\"\n\n\"You're being totally unreasonable,\" Phillip said, glowering at his wife\nin annoyance. She wasn't the sweet young thing he had married, not this\nevening. Her eyes were puffy, her nose red and dripping. \"You've had\nthis cold for two solid months now, and there just isn't any sense to\nit. It's making you miserable. You can't eat, you can't breathe, you\ncan't sleep.\"\n\n\"I dod't wadt eddy cold shots,\" she repeated stubbornly.\n\n\"But why not? Just one little needle, you'd hardly feel it.\"\n\n\"But I dod't like deedles!\" she cried, bursting into tears. \"Why dod't\nyou leave be alode? Go take your dasty old deedles ad stick theb id\npeople that wadt theb.\"\n\n\"Aw, Ellie--\"\n\n\"I dod't care, _I dod't like deedles_!\" she wailed, burying her face in\nhis shirt.\n\nHe held her close, making comforting little noises. It was no use, he\nreflected sadly. Science just wasn't Ellie's long suit; she didn't know\na cold vaccine from a case of smallpox, and no appeal to logic or common\nsense could surmount her irrational fear of hypodermics. \"All right,\nnobody's going to make you do anything you don't want to,\" he said.\n\n\"Ad eddyway, thik of the poor tissue badufacturers,\" she sniffled,\nwiping her nose with a pink facial tissue. \"All their little childred\nstarvig to death.\"\n\n\"Say, you _have_ got a cold,\" said Phillip, sniffing. \"You've got on\nenough perfume to fell an ox.\" He wiped away tears and grinned at her.\n\"Come on now, fix your face. Dinner at the Driftwood? I hear they have\nmarvelous lamb chops.\"\n\nIt was a mellow evening. The lamb chops were delectable--the tastiest\nlamb chops he had ever eaten, he thought, even being blessed with as\ngood a cook as Ellie for a spouse. Ellie dripped and blew continuously,\nbut refused to go home until they had taken in a movie, and stopped by\nto dance a while. \"I hardly ever gedt to see you eddy bore,\" she said.\n\"All because of that dasty bedicide you're givig people.\"\n\nIt was true, of course. The work at the lab was endless. They danced,\nbut came home early nevertheless. Phillip needed all the sleep he could\nget.\n\nHe awoke once during the night to a parade of sneezes from his wife, and\nrolled over, frowning sleepily to himself. It was ignominious, in a\nway--his own wife refusing the fruit of all those months of work.\n\nAnd cold or no cold, she surely was using a whale of a lot of perfume.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe awoke, suddenly, began to stretch, and sat bolt upright in bed,\nstaring wildly about the room. Pale morning sunlight drifted in the\nwindow. Downstairs he heard Ellie stirring in the kitchen.\n\nFor a moment he thought he was suffocating. He leaped out of bed, stared\nat the vanity table across the room. \"_Somebody's spilled the whole\ndamned bottle--_\"\n\nThe heavy sick-sweet miasma hung like a cloud around him, drenching the\nroom. With every breath it grew thicker. He searched the table top\nfrantically, but there were no empty bottles. His head began to spin\nfrom the sickening effluvium.\n\nHe blinked in confusion, his hand trembling as he lit a cigarette. No\nneed to panic, he thought. She probably knocked a bottle over when she\nwas dressing. He took a deep puff, and burst into a paroxysm of coughing\nas acrid fumes burned down his throat to his lungs.\n\n\"Ellie!\" He rushed into the hall, still coughing. The match smell had\ngiven way to the harsh, caustic stench of burning weeds. He stared at\nhis cigarette in horror and threw it into the sink. The smell grew\nworse. He threw open the hall closet, expecting smoke to come billowing\nout. \"Ellie! Somebody's burning down the house!\"\n\n\"Whadtever are you talking about?\" Ellie's voice came from the stair\nwell. \"It's just the toast I burned, silly.\"\n\nHe rushed down the stairs two at a time--and nearly gagged as he reached\nthe bottom. The smell of hot, rancid grease struck him like a solid\nwall. It was intermingled with an oily smell of boiled and parboiled\ncoffee, overpowering in its intensity. By the time he reached the\nkitchen he was holding his nose, tears pouring from his eyes. \"_Ellie,\nwhat are you doing in here?_\"\n\nShe stared at him. \"I'b baking breakfast.\"\n\n\"But don't you _smell_ it?\"\n\n\"Sbell whadt?\" said Ellie.\n\nOn the stove the automatic percolator was making small, promising\nnoises. In the frying pan four sunnyside eggs were sizzling; half a\ndozen strips of bacon drained on a paper towel on the sideboard. It\ncouldn't have looked more innocent.\n\nCautiously, Phillip released his nose, sniffed. The stench nearly choked\nhim. \"You mean you don't smell anything _strange_?\"\n\n\"I did't sbell eddythig, period,\" said Ellie defensively.\n\n\"The coffee, the bacon--_come here a minute_.\"\n\nShe reeked--of bacon, of coffee, of burned toast, but mostly of perfume.\n\"Did you put on any fresh perfume this morning?\"\n\n\"Before breakfast? Dod't be ridiculous.\"\n\n\"Not even a drop?\" Phillip was turning very white.\n\n\"Dot a drop.\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"Now, wait a minute. This must be all in my mind.\nI'm--just imagining things, that's all. Working too hard, hysterical\nreaction. In a minute it'll all go away.\" He poured a cup of coffee,\nadded cream and sugar.\n\nBut he couldn't get it close enough to taste it. It smelled as if it had\nbeen boiling three weeks in a rancid pot. It was the smell of coffee,\nall right, but a smell that was fiendishly distorted, overpoweringly,\nnauseatingly magnified. It pervaded the room and burned his throat and\nbrought tears gushing to his eyes.\n\nSlowly, realization began to dawn. He spilled the coffee as he set the\ncup down. The perfume. The coffee. The cigarette....\n\n\"My hat,\" he choked. \"Get me my hat. I've got to get to the laboratory.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt got worse all the way downtown. He fought down waves of nausea as the\nsmell of damp, rotting earth rose from his front yard in a gray cloud.\nThe neighbor's dog dashed out to greet him, exuding the\ngreat-grandfather of all doggy odors. As Phillip waited for the bus,\nevery passing car fouled the air with noxious fumes, gagging him,\ndoubling him up with coughing as he dabbed at his streaming eyes.\n\nNobody else seemed to notice anything wrong at all.\n\nThe bus ride was a nightmare. It was a damp, rainy day; the inside of\nthe bus smelled like the men's locker room after a big game. A\nbleary-eyed man with three-days' stubble on his chin flopped down in the\nseat next to him, and Phillip reeled back with a jolt to the job he had\nheld in his student days, cleaning vats in the brewery.\n\n\"It'sh a great morning,\" Bleary-eyes breathed at him, \"huh, Doc?\"\nPhillip blanched. To top it, the man had had a breakfast of salami. In\nthe seat ahead, a fat man held a dead cigar clamped in his mouth like a\nrank growth. Phillip's stomach began rolling; he sank his face into his\nhand, trying unobtrusively to clamp his nostrils. With a groan of\ndeliverance he lurched off the bus at the laboratory gate.\n\nHe met Jake Miles coming up the steps. Jake looked pale, too pale.\n\n\"Morning,\" Phillip said weakly. \"Nice day. Looks like the sun might come\nthrough.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Jake. \"Nice day. You--uh--feel all right this morning?\"\n\n\"Fine, fine.\" Phillip tossed his hat in the closet, opened the incubator\non his culture tubes, trying to look busy. He slammed the door after one\nwhiff and gripped the edge of the work table with whitening knuckles.\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing. Thought you looked a little peaked, was all.\"\n\nThey stared at each other in silence. Then, as though by signal, their\neyes turned to the office at the end of the lab.\n\n\"Coffin come in yet?\"\n\nJake nodded. \"He's in there. He's got the door locked.\"\n\n\"I think he's going to have to open it,\" said Phillip.\n\nA gray-faced Dr. Coffin unlocked the door, backed quickly toward the\nwall. The room reeked of kitchen deodorant. \"Stay right where you are,\"\nCoffin squeaked. \"Don't come a step closer. I can't see you now.\nI'm--I'm busy, I've got work that has to be done--\"\n\n\"You're telling _me_,\" growled Phillip. He motioned Jake into the office\nand locked the door carefully. Then he turned to Coffin. \"When did it\nstart for you?\"\n\nCoffin was trembling. \"Right after supper last night. I thought I was\ngoing to suffocate. Got up and walked the streets all night. My God,\nwhat a stench!\"\n\n\"Jake?\"\n\nDr. Miles shook his head. \"Sometime this morning, I don't know when. I\nwoke up with it.\"\n\n\"That's when it hit me,\" said Phillip.\n\n\"But I don't understand,\" Coffin howled. \"Nobody else seems to notice\nanything--\"\n\n\"Yet,\" said Phillip, \"we were the first three to take the Coffin Cure,\nremember? You, and me and Jake. Two months ago.\"\n\nCoffin's forehead was beaded with sweat. He stared at the two men in\ngrowing horror. \"_But what about the others?_\" he whispered.\n\n\"I think,\" said Phillip, \"that we'd better find something spectacular to\ndo in a mighty big hurry. That's what I think.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJake Miles said, \"The most important thing right now is secrecy. We\nmustn't let a word get out, not until we're absolutely certain.\"\n\n\"But what's _happened_?\" Coffin cried. \"These foul smells, everywhere.\nYou, Phillip, you had a cigarette this morning. I can smell it clear\nover here, and it's bringing tears to my eyes. And if I didn't know\nbetter I'd swear neither of you had had a bath in a week. Every odor in\ntown has suddenly turned foul--\"\n\n\"_Magnified_, you mean,\" said Jake. \"Perfume still smells sweet--there's\njust too much of it. The same with cinnamon; I tried it. Cried for half\nan hour, but it still smelled like cinnamon. No, I don't think the\n_smells_ have changed any.\"\n\n\"But what, then?\"\n\n\"Our noses have changed, obviously.\" Jake paced the floor in excitement.\n\"Look at our dogs! They've never had colds--and they practically live by\ntheir noses. Other animals--all dependent on their senses of smell for\nsurvival--and none of them ever have anything even vaguely reminiscent\nof a common cold. The multicentric virus hits primates only--_and it\nreaches its fullest parasitic powers in man alone_!\"\n\nCoffin shook his head miserably. \"But why this horrible stench all of a\nsudden? I haven't had a cold in weeks--\"\n\n\"Of course not! That's just what I'm trying to say,\" Jake cried. \"Look,\nwhy do we have any sense of smell at all? Because we have tiny olfactory\nnerve endings buried in the mucous membrane of our noses and throats.\nBut we have always had the virus living there, too, colds or no colds,\nthroughout our entire lifetime. It's _always_ been there, anchored in\nthe same cells, parasitizing the same sensitive tissues that carry our\nolfactory nerve endings, numbing them and crippling them, making them\npractically useless as sensory organs. No wonder we never smelled\nanything before! Those poor little nerve endings never had a chance!\"\n\n\"Until we came along in our shining armor and destroyed the virus,\" said\nPhillip.\n\n\"Oh, we didn't destroy it. We merely stripped it of a very slippery\nprotective mechanism against normal body defences.\" Jake perched on the\nedge of the desk, his dark face intense. \"These two months since we had\nour shots have witnessed a battle to the death between our bodies and\nthe virus. With the help of the vaccine, our bodies have won, that's\nall--stripped away the last vestiges of an invader that has been almost\na part of our normal physiology since the beginning of time. And now for\nthe first time those crippled little nerve endings are just beginning to\nfunction.\"\n\n\"God help us,\" Coffin groaned. \"You think it'll get worse?\"\n\n\"And worse. And still worse,\" said Jake.\n\n\"I wonder,\" said Phillip slowly, \"what the anthropologists will say.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Maybe it was just a single mutation somewhere back there. Just a tiny\nchange of cell structure or metabolism that left one line of primates\nvulnerable to an invader no other would harbor. Why else should man have\nbegun to flower and blossom intellectually--grow to depend so much on\nhis brains instead of his brawn that he could rise above all others?\nWhat better reason than because somewhere along the line in the world of\nfang and claw _he suddenly lost his sense of smell_?\"\n\nThey stared at each other. \"Well, he's got it back again now,\" Coffin\nwailed, \"and he's not going to like it a bit.\"\n\n\"No, he surely isn't,\" Jake agreed. \"He's going to start looking very\nquickly for someone to blame, I think.\"\n\nThey both looked at Coffin.\n\n\"Now don't be ridiculous, boys,\" said Coffin, turning white. \"We're in\nthis together. Phillip, it was your idea in the first place--you said so\nyourself! You can't leave me now--\"\n\nThe telephone jangled. They heard the frightened voice of the secretary\nclear across the room. \"Dr. Coffin? There was a student on the line just\na moment ago. He--he said he was coming up to see you. Now, he said, not\nlater.\"\n\n\"I'm busy,\" Coffin sputtered. \"I can't see anyone. And I can't take any\ncalls.\"\n\n\"But he's already on his way up,\" the girl burst out. \"He was saying\nsomething about tearing you apart with his bare hands.\"\n\nCoffin slammed down the receiver. His face was the color of lead.\n\"They'll crucify me!\" he sobbed. \"Jake--Phillip--you've got to help me.\"\n\nPhillip sighed and unlocked the door. \"Send a girl down to the freezer\nand have her bring up all the live cold virus she can find. Get us some\ninoculated monkeys and a few dozen dogs.\" He turned to Coffin. \"And\nstop sniveling. You're the big publicity man around here; you're going\nto handle the screaming masses, whether you like it or not.\"\n\n\"But what are you going to do?\"\n\n\"I haven't the faintest idea,\" said Phillip, \"but whatever I do is going\nto cost you your shirt. We're going to find out how to catch cold again\nif we have to die.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was an admirable struggle, and a futile one. They sprayed their noses\nand throats with enough pure culture of virulent live virus to have\ncondemned an ordinary man to a lifetime of sneezing, watery-eyed misery.\nThey didn't develop a sniffle among them. They mixed six different\nstrains of virus and gargled the extract, spraying themselves and every\ninoculated monkey they could get their hands on with the vile-smelling\nstuff. Not a sneeze. They injected it hypodermically, intradermally,\nsubcutaneously, intramuscularly, and intravenously. They drank it. They\nbathed in the stuff.\n\nBut they didn't catch a cold.\n\n\"Maybe it's the wrong approach,\" Jake said one morning. \"Our body\ndefenses are keyed up to top performance right now. Maybe if we break\nthem down we can get somewhere.\"\n\nThey plunged down that alley with grim abandon. They starved themselves.\nThey forced themselves to stay awake for days on end, until exhaustion\nforced their eyes closed in spite of all they could do. They carefully\ndevised vitamin-free, protein-free, mineral-free diets that tasted like\nlibrary paste and smelled worse. They wore wet clothes and sopping shoes\nto work, turned off the heat and threw windows open to the raw winter\nair. Then they resprayed themselves with the live cold virus and waited\nreverently for the sneezing to begin.\n\nIt didn't. They stared at each other in gathering gloom. They'd never\nfelt better in their lives.\n\nExcept for the smells, of course. They'd hoped that they might,\npresently, get used to them. They didn't. Every day it grew a little\nworse. They began smelling smells they never dreamed existed--noxious\nsmells, cloying smells, smells that drove them gagging to the sinks.\nTheir nose-plugs were rapidly losing their effectiveness. Mealtimes were\nnightmarish ordeals; they lost weight with alarming speed.\n\nBut they didn't catch cold.\n\n\"_I_ think you should all be locked up,\" Ellie Dawson said severely as\nshe dragged her husband, blue-faced and shivering, out of an icy shower\none bitter morning. \"You've lost your wits. You need to be protected\nagainst yourselves, that's what you need.\"\n\n\"You don't understand,\" Phillip moaned. \"We've _got_ to catch cold.\"\n\n\"Why?\" Ellie snapped angrily. \"Suppose you don't--what's going to\nhappen?\"\n\n\"We had three hundred students march on the laboratory today,\" Phillip\nsaid patiently. \"The smells were driving them crazy, they said. They\ncouldn't even bear to be close to their best friends. They wanted\nsomething done about it, or else they wanted blood. Tomorrow we'll have\nthem back and three hundred more. And they were just the pilot study!\nWhat's going to happen when fifteen million people find their noses\ngoing bad on them?\" He shuddered. \"Have you seen the papers? People are\nalready going around sniffing like bloodhounds. And _now_ we're finding\nout what a thorough job we did. We can't crack it, Ellie. We can't even\nget a toe hold. Those antibodies are just doing too good a job.\"\n\n\"Well, maybe you can find some unclebodies to take care of them,\" Ellie\noffered vaguely.\n\n\"Look, don't make bad jokes--\"\n\n\"I'm not making jokes! All I want is a husband back who doesn't complain\nabout how everything smells, and eats the dinners I cook, and doesn't\nstand around in cold showers at six in the morning.\"\n\n\"I know it's miserable,\" he said helplessly. \"But I don't know how to\nstop it.\"\n\nHe found Jake and Coffin in tight-lipped conference when he reached the\nlab. \"I can't do it any more,\" Coffin was saying. \"I've begged them for\ntime. I've threatened them. I've promised them everything but my upper\nplate. I can't face them again, I just can't.\"\n\n\"We only have a few days left,\" Jake said grimly. \"If we don't come up\nwith something, we're goners.\"\n\nPhillip's jaw suddenly sagged as he stared at them. \"You know what I\nthink?\" he said suddenly. \"I think we've been prize idiots. We've gotten\nso rattled we haven't used our heads. And all the time it's been sitting\nthere blinking at us!\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" snapped Jake.\n\n\"Unclebodies,\" said Phillip.\n\n\"Oh, great God!\"\n\n\"No, I'm serious.\" Phillip's eyes were very bright. \"How many of those\nstudents do you think you can corral to help us?\"\n\nCoffin gulped. \"Six hundred. They're out there in the street right now,\nhowling for a lynching.\"\n\n\"All right, I want them in here. And I want some monkeys. Monkeys with\ncolds, the worse colds the better.\"\n\n\"Do you have any idea what you're doing?\" asked Jake.\n\n\"None in the least,\" said Phillip happily, \"except that it's never been\ndone before. But maybe it's time we tried following our noses for a\nwhile.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe tidal wave began to break two days later ... only a few people here,\na dozen there, but enough to confirm the direst newspaper predictions.\nThe boomerang was completing its circle.\n\nAt the laboratory the doors were kept barred, the telephones\ndisconnected. Within, there was a bustle of feverish--if\nodorous--activity. For the three researchers, the olfactory acuity had\nreached agonizing proportions. Even the small gas masks Phillip had\ndevised could no longer shield them from the constant barrage of violent\nodors.\n\nBut the work went on in spite of the smell. Truckloads of monkeys\narrived at the lab--cold-ridden monkeys, sneezing, coughing, weeping,\nwheezing monkeys by the dozen. Culture trays bulged with tubes,\noverflowed the incubators and work tables. Each day six hundred angry\nstudents paraded through the lab, arms exposed, mouths open, grumbling\nbut co-operating.\n\nAt the end of the first week, half the monkeys were cured of their colds\nand were quite unable to catch them back; the other half had new colds\nand couldn't get rid of them. Phillip observed this fact with grim\nsatisfaction, and went about the laboratory mumbling to himself.\n\nTwo days later he burst forth jubilantly, lugging a sad-looking puppy\nunder his arm. It was like no other puppy in the world. This puppy was\nsneezing and snuffling with a perfect howler of a cold.\n\nThe day came when they injected a tiny droplet of milky fluid beneath\nthe skin of Phillip's arm, and then got the virus spray and gave his\nnose and throat a liberal application. Then they sat back and waited.\n\nThey were still waiting three days later.\n\n\"It was a great idea,\" Jake said gloomily, flipping a bulging notebook\nclosed with finality. \"It just didn't work, was all.\"\n\nPhillip nodded. Both men had grown thin, with pouches under their eyes.\nJake's right eye had begun to twitch uncontrollably whenever anyone came\nwithin three yards of him. \"We can't go on like this, you know. The\npeople are going wild.\"\n\n\"Where's Coffin?\"\n\n\"He collapsed three days ago. Nervous prostration. He kept having dreams\nabout hangings.\"\n\nPhillip sighed. \"Well, I suppose we'd better just face it. Nice knowing\nyou, Jake. Pity it had to be this way.\"\n\n\"It was a great try, old man. A great try.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes. Nothing like going down in a blaze of--\"\n\nPhillip stopped dead, his eyes widening. His nose began to twitch. He\ntook a gasp, a larger gasp, as a long-dead reflex came sleepily to life,\nshook its head, reared back ...\n\nPhillip sneezed.\n\nHe sneezed for ten minutes without a pause, until he lay on the floor\nblue-faced and gasping for air. He caught hold of Jake, wringing his\nhand as tears gushed from his eyes. He gave his nose an enormous blow,\nand headed shakily for the telephone.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"It was a sipple edough pridciple,\" he said later to Ellie as she spread\nmustard on his chest and poured more warm water into his foot bath. \"The\nCure itself depedded upod it--the adtiged-adtibody reactiod. We had the\nadtibody agaidst the virus, all ridght; what we had to find was sobe\nkide of adtibody agaidst the _adtibody_.\" He sneezed violently, and\npoured in nose drops with a happy grin.\n\n\"Will they be able to make it fast enough?\"\n\n\"Just aboudt fast edough for people to get good ad eager to catch cold\nagaid,\" said Phillip. \"There's odly wud little hitch....\"\n\nEllie Dawson took the steaks from the grill and set them, still\nsizzling, on the dinner table. \"Hitch?\"\n\nPhillip nodded as he chewed the steak with a pretence of enthusiasm. It\ntasted like slightly damp K-ration.\n\n\"This stuff we've bade does a real good job. Just a little too good.\" He\nwiped his nose and reached for a fresh tissue.\n\n\"I bay be wrog, but I thik I've got this cold for keeps,\" he said sadly.\n\"Udless I cad fide ad adtibody agaidst the adtibody agaidst the\nadtibody--\"\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from \"Tiger by the Tail and Other Science\n    Fiction Stories by Alan E.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
