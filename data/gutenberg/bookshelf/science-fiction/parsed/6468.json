She's\nfinished!\"\n\n\"I guess we've done all we can to her before her trial trip,\" admitted\nhis chum, Mark Sampson, but in a less confident tone.\n\n\"You don't see anything wrong with her, old croaker; do you?\" demanded\nJack, laughing as usual.\n\n\"'The proof of the pudding is in the eating thereof; not in chewing\nthe pudding bag string',\" quoted Mark, still with a serious countenance.\n\nBut like Jack he stood off from the great body of the wonderful airship,\nand looked the completed task over with some satisfaction. Having\nemergency wings, she was also a plane. She was white all over and her\nname was the _Snowbird_. Jack and Mark had spent most of their time\nduring this vacation from their college in building this flying machine,\nwhich was veritably an up-to-the-minute aerial vehicle, built for both\nspeed and carrying capacity.\n\nThe hangar in which the machine had been built was connected with\nProfessor Amos Henderson's laboratory and workshop, hidden away on a\nlonely point on the seacoast, about ten miles from the town of Easton,\nMaine. At this spot had been built many wonderful things--mainly the\ninventions of the boys' friend and protector, Professor Henderson; but\nthe _Snowbird_, upon which Jack and Mark now gazed so proudly, was\naltogether the boys' own work.\n\nThe sliding door of the hangar opened just behind the two boys and a\nblack face appeared.\n\n\"Is eeder ob you boys seen ma Shanghai rooster?\" queried the black\nman, plaintively. \"I suah can't fin' him nowhars.\"\n\n\"What did you let him out of his coop for?\" demanded Mark. \"You're\nalways bothering us about that rooster, Washington. He is as elusive\nas the Fourth Dimension.\"\n\n\"I dunno wot dat fourth condension is, Massa Mark; but dat rooster is\nsuah some conclusive. When I lets him out fo' an airin' he hikes right\nstraight fo' some farmer's hen-yard, an' den I haster hunt fo' him.\"\n\n\"When you see him starting on his rambles, Wash, why don't you call\nhim back?\" demanded Jack Darrow, chuckling. \"If I did, Massa Jack,\nI'spect he wouldn't know I was a-hollerin' fo' him.\"\n\n\"How's that? Doesn't he know his name?\"\n\n\"I don't fo' suah know wedder he does or not,\" returned the darkey,\nscratching his head \"Ye see, it's a suah 'nuff longitudinous name, an'\nI dunno wedder he remembers it all, or not.\"\n\n\"He's got a bad memory; has he?\" said Mark, turning to smile at\nWashington White, too, for Professor Henderson's old servant usually\nafforded the boys much amusement.\n\n\"Dunno 'bout his memory,\" grunted Wash; \"he's gotter good forgettery,\nsuah 'nuff. Leastways, when he starts off on one o' dese\nperambulationaries ob his, he fergits ter come back.\"\n\n\"Let's see,\" said Jack, nudging his chum, \"what _is_ that\nlongitudinous' name which has been hitched onto that wonderful bird,\nWash? I know it begins with the discovery of America and wanders down\nthrough the ages to the present day; but a part of it has slipped my\nmemory--or, perhaps I should say, 'forgettery'.\"\n\nWith a perfectly serious face the darkey declaimed:\n\n  \"Christopher Columbus Amerigo Vespucci\n  George Washington Abraham Lincoln Ulysses\n  Grant Garibaldi Thomas Edison Guglielmo Marconi\n  Butts.\"\n\n\"For goodness sake! Will you listen to that!\" gasped Mark, while Jack\nwent off into a roar of laughter.\n\n\"Don't--don't it make your jaw ache to say it, Wash?\" cried the older\nlad when he could speak.\n\n\"Not a-tall! not a-tall!\" rejoined the darkey, shaking his woolly head.\n\"I has practised all ma life speakin' de berry longest words in de\nEnglish language--\"\n\n\"And mispronouncing them,\" giggled Jack.\n\n\"Mebbe, Massa Jack, mebbe!\" agreed Washington, briskly. \"But de copy\nbook say dat it is better to have tried an' failed dan nebber to have\ntried at all.\"\n\n\"And did you ever try calling the rooster back, when he starts to play\ntruant, with all that mouthful of words?\" queried the amused Mark.\n\n\"Yes, indeedy,\" said Washington, seriously.\n\n\"Don't he mind, then?\"\n\n\"I should think he'd be struck motionless in his tracks,\" chuckled\nJack.\n\n\"No, sah,\" said Washington. \"Dat's de only fault I kin fin' with dat\nname--it don't 'pear to stop him. An' befo' I kin git it all out he's\nginerally out ob sight!\"\n\nThat sent both boys off into another paroxysm of laughter. Meanwhile\nthe darkey had come into the great shed and was slowly walking around\nthe flying machine. \"What do you think of her, Wash, now that she's\nfinished?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"Is she done done?\" queried the darkey, wonderingly.\n\n\"She certainly is,\" agreed Jack.\n\n\"De chile is bawn and done named Nebbercudsneezer, heh? Well! well!\"\n\n\"No; it's named the _Snowbird_,\" Mark retorted. \"And to-morrow\nmorning, bright and early, we shall sail on its trial trip. The\nprofessor is going with us, Washington. Of course, you will come, too?\"\n\n\"Lawsy me! don't see how I kin!\" stammered Washington White, who always\nwished to be considered very brave, but who was really as timid as a\nhare. \"Yo' see, Massa Mark, I'spect I shall be right busy.\"\n\n\"What will you be busy at?\" demanded Jack.\n\n\"Well--well, sah,\" said Wash, \"if dat Shanghai don't come back befo',\nI shall hab ter go snoopin' aroun' de kentry a-huntin' fo' him. He'll\nbe crowin' 'bout sun-up, an' he suah can't disguise his crow.\"\n\n\"If Andy was here, he would surely want to go with us,\" declared Jack\nto Mark. \"Andy Sudds isn't afraid of anything.\"\n\n\"My! my!\" cried Washington. \"Yo' don't fo' one moment suppose, Massa\nJack, dat I's afeared; does yo'?\" \"No, you're not afraid, Wash,\"\nreturned Jack, chuckling. \"You're only scared to death. But you go\nahead and hunt your rooster. See that you keep him from flying too\nhigh, however, or we'll run him down in the _Snowbird_.\"\n\n\"Pshaw!\" said Mark. \"That rooster is so fat he couldn't fly\nhigh, anyway.\"\n\n\"And perhaps the _Snowbird_ won't fly very high; eh?\" retorted Jack,\nletting a little anxiety creep into his voice.\n\n\"But dat rooster suah _kin_ fly high,\" said Washington White, eagerly.\n\"Yo' gemmens knows dat he's flowed as high as de moon--he, he!\"\n\n\"And 'flowed' is a mighty good word, Wash,\" chuckled Jack. \"Ah! here\nis the professor, Mark.\"\n\nProfessor Henderson was an aged man with snow white hair and beard.\nAlthough he was not physically as strong as he once was, his brain and\nenergy were not in the least impaired by advancing years. He had taken\nthe two lads, Jack Darrow and Mark Sampson, both orphans, under his\ncare some years before, and under his tuition and by his aid they were\nmuch farther advanced in knowledge of the practical sciences than other\nboys of their age.\n\nThe professor welcomed them cordially and at their request gave a\nthorough scrutiny to the various mechanical contrivances that went to\nthe make-up of the flying machine. He pronounced it, as far as could\nbe known before a practical test, a perfect mechanism.\n\n\"And we will try it to-morrow morning, boys,\" he said, with almost as\nmuch enthusiasm as Jack and Mark themselves displayed. \"You have\ncompleted the machine in excellent time, and I 'un likewise ready to\nmake the experiment.\"\n\n\"What experiment, Professor?\" asked the boys in chorus.\n\n\"Haven't you noticed what I was tinkering on at the other end of the\nshop?\" queried Professor Henderson, in surprise.\n\n\"Why, I see that you have a long steel plank there, with some kind of\na compressed air contrivance at one end,\" said Jack.\n\n\"Is that what you mean, Professor?\" queried Mark.\n\n\"That, boys,\" said the scientist, with some pride, \"is a modern\ncatapult--an up-to-the-minute catapult which, had it been known to the\nancients, would have enabled the hosts of Joshua, for instance, to\nbatter down the walls of Jericho without the trouble of marching so\nmany times around the city.\"\n\n\"And what has a compressed air catapult got to do with the\n_Snowbird_?\" queried Jack. \"You propose launching your flying machine in\nthe usual way,\" said the professor. \"I see you have wheel trucks all\nready to slip under her. We will not use those wheels, boys. I have a\nbetter plan. We will launch the _Snowbird_ into the air from my\ncatapult.\"\n\n\"Great goodness, Professor!\" cried Mark. \"Is that practicable?\"\n\n\"We'll know after we have tried it,\" retorted Professor Henderson,\ndrily.\n\n\"How did you happen to start working on this catapult idea?\" asked\nJack.\n\n\"Well, I can't tell you everything,\" replied the inventor, \"for it is\npartly a secret.\"\n\n\"Huh,\" laughed Mark. \"You're mysterious. You haven't joined forces\nwith some department of our government, or with another country?\"\n\nThe professor smiled, thinking how keen this young man always proved\nhimself to be.\n\n\"You've guessed it,\" he replied. \"And I'm sorry I can't explain more\nto you.\"\n\n\"We understand,\" said Jack. \"And no doubt this machine is a\nsuper-catapult.\"\n\n\"True,\" was the answer. \"Of untold use to the scientific world. For\nthe present I shall confine testing its efficiency right in this place.\nNow is my chance.\"\n\n\"But of what advantage will it be to our flying machine to start it\nin this way?\" \"Stop and think, my boy,\" said the professor. \"Just as\nan aeroplane can literally be shot into the air within a very short\nspace, so can your airship. Of course, this is not necessary, but we\nwill be able to start the ship much faster that way than we could\nwithjust the motors.\"\n\n\"You'll make history, Professor,\" added Jack. \"Exciting headlines for\nthe papers.\"\n\n\"Sure enough,\" said Mark enthusiastically.\n\n\"The publicity doesn't interest me,\" replied the scientist. \"Moreover,\nmy super-catapult must remain a secret, as I told you a while ago.\"\n\n\"So you really propose to launch the _Snowbird_ in this way?\" asked\nJack.\n\n\"We will be shot into the air. If you are sure of your machine, I am\nsure of my catapult, and we will try the two contrivances together.\"\n\nIn the morning all rose bright and early and prepared the _Snowbird_ for\nher trial flight. Washington White had indeed disappeared--possibly in\nsearch of his Shanghai rooster--and Andy Sudds was off on a hunt.\nTherefore the professor and his two young comrades essayed the trip\nalone.\n\nJack and Mark tossed a coin to see who should first guide the great\nair machine, and Mark won the preference. He, as well as his chum and\nthe professor, had already donned their aeronautic uniforms, and he\nnow strapped himself into the pilot's seat. The steering apparatus,\nthe levers that controlled the planes, and the motor switch were all\nunder his hand. While in flight the _Snowbird_ need be under the\ncontrol of but one person at a time.\n\nThe professor had rigged his catapult so that he could release the\ntrigger from the flying machine. Mark said he was ready; the professor\nreached for the cord which would release the trigger.\n\n\"Start your motor, Mark, a fraction of a second before I release the\ncompressed air,\" commanded Mr. Henderson. \"Now!\"\n\nThe motor of the flying machine buzzed faintly. Jack's eyes were on\nthe speed indicator. He suddenly felt the great, quivering flying\nmachine, which had been run out of the hangar on to the steel plank\nof the catapult, lurch forward. The feeling affected him just as the\nsudden dropping of an elevator from a great height affects its\npassengers.\n\nThe finger of the speed indicator whirled and marked forty miles an\nhour ere the flying machine left the steel plank, and shot into the\nair with the fearful force of the compressed air behind it.\n\nBoth Mark and Jack were well used to guiding aeroplanes and other air\nmachines. But this start from the ground was much different from the\neasy, swooping flight of an airship as usually begun. Like an arrow\nthe _Snowbird_ was shot upward on a long slant. It was a moment\nere Mark got the controls to working. The propellers were, of course,\nstarted with the first stroke of the motor.\n\nBut Mark Sampson was nervous; there was no denying that. At the instant\nwhen the nose of the airship should have been raised, so as to clear\nthe tops of the forest trees and every building on the Henderson place,\nMark instead guided the rapidly flying _Snowbird_ far to the left.\n\nIt skimmed the corner of the stable by a fraction of a foot, and Jack\nyelled:\n\n\"Look out!\"\n\nHis cry made Mark even more nervous. The tall water-tank and windmill\nwere right in line. Before the young aviator could swerve the flying\nmachine to escape the vane upon the roof of the tower, and the long\narms of the mill, they were right upon these things!\n\nThe fast-shooting _Snowbird_ was jarred through all her members; but she\ntore loose. And then, in erratic leaps and bounds, she kept on across\nthe fields and woods towards Easton, never rising very high, but\noccasionally sinking so that she trailed across the treetops,\nthreatening the whole party with death and the flying machine itself\nwith destruction, at every jump.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nMARK HANGS ON\n\n\nProfessor Henderson and his adopted sons--Jack Darrow and Mark\nSampson--had been in many perilous situations together. Neither one\nnor the other was likely to display panic at the present juncture,\nalthough the flying _Snowbird_ was playing a gigantic game of\n\"leap-frog\" through the air.\n\nThe professor had himself constructed many wonderful machines for\ntransportation through the air, under the ground, and both on and\nbeneath the sea; and in them he and his young comrades had voyaged\nafar.\n\nNarrated in the first volume of this series, entitled, \"Through the\nAir to the North Pole,\" was the bringing together of the two boys and\nthe professor,--how the scientist and Washington White rescued Jack\nand Mark after a train wreck, took them to the professor's workshop,\nand made the lads his special care. In that workshop was built the\n_Electric Monarch_, in which flying ship the party actually passed\nover that point far beyond the Arctic Circle where the needle of the\ncompass indicates the North Pole.\n\nLater, in the submarine boat, the _Porpoise,_ the professor, with\nhis young assistants and others, voyaged under the sea to the South\nPole, the details of which voyage are related in the second volume of\nthe series, entitled \"Under the Ocean to the South Pole.\"\n\nIn the third volume, \"Five Thousand Miles Underground,\" is related the\nbuilding of that strange craft, the _Flying Mermaid_, and how the\nvoyagers journeyed to the center of the earth. The perils connected\nwith this experience satisfied all of them, as far as adventure went,\nfor some time. Jack and Mark prepared for, and entered, the Universal\nElectrical and Chemical College.\n\nBefore the first year of their college course was completed, however,\nProfessor Henderson, in partnership with a brother scientist, Professor\nSantell Roumann, projected and carried through a marvelous campaign\nwith the aid of Jack and Mark, which is narrated in our fourth volume,\nentitled, \"Through Space to Mars.\" In this book is told how the\nprojectile, _Annihilator_, was built and, the projectile being driven by\nthe Etherium motor, the party was transported to the planet Mars.\n\nLater, because of some knowledge obtained from a Martian newspaper by\nJack, they all made a trip to the moon in search of a field of diamonds,\nand their adventures as related in \"Lost on the Moon\" were of the most\nthrilling kind. The projectile brought them safely home again and they\nhad now, for some months, been quietly pursuing their usual avocations.\n\nThe knowledge Jack Darrow and Mark Sampson had gained from textbooks,\nand much from observation and the teachings of Professor Henderson,\nhad aided the lads in the building of the _Snowbird_. It was the first\nmechanism of importance that Jack and Mark had ever completed, and they\nhad been quite confident, before the flying machine was shot from Mr.\nHenderson's catapult, that it was as near perfect as an untried\naeroplane could be.\n\n\"Hang on, Mark!\" yelled Jack, as the great machine soared and pitched\nover the forest.\n\nHer leaps were huge, and the shock each time she descended and rose\nagain threatened to shake the 'plane to bits. Mark swayed in his seat,\nclutching first one lever and then another, while Professor Henderson\nand Jack could only cling with both hands to the guys and stay-wires.\n\nThe sensation of being so high above the earth, and in imminent danger\nof being dashed headlong to it, gripped Mark Sampson like a giant\nhand. He felt difficulty in breathing, although it was not the height\nthat gave him that choking sensation. There was a mist before his eyes,\nstill the sun was shining brightly. The startling gyrations of the\nflying machine for some time shook the lad to the core.\n\nBut Jack's cheerful cry of \"Hang on!\" spurred Mark to a new activity--an\nactivity of hand as well as brain. He knew that something had fouled\nand that this accident was the cause of the machine making such\nsickening bounds in the air. She was overbalanced in some way.\n\nWith Jack's encouraging shout ringing in his ears, Mark came to himself.\nHe _would_ hang on! His friends depended upon him to control the machine\nand to save them from destruction, and he would not be found wanting.\n\nOne lever after another he gripped and tried. It was one controlling\nthe rising power that was fouled. He learned this in a moment. He\nsought to move it to and fro in its socket and could not do so. He had\noverlooked this lever before.\n\nAgain the _Snowbird_ dashed herself from a height of five hundred feet\ntoward the earth.\n\nThey still flew over the forest. The tops of the trees intervened, and\nMark managed to counteract the plunge before the prow of the machine\nburst through the treetops. She rose again, and using both hands, Mark\njerked the wheel stick into place.\n\nAt once the flying machine responded to the change. She rode straight\non, slightly rising as he had pointed her, and Mark dared touch the\nmotor switch again. Instantly the machine speeded ahead.\n\n\"Hurrah for Mark!\" shrieked Jack. \"He's pulled us through.\"\n\n\"He has indeed,\" agreed the professor, and they settled into their\nseats and gave attention to the working of the apparatus. Mark now had\nthe _Snowbird_ well under control.\n\nJack changed places with his chum and managed the _Snowbird_ equally\nwell. At his touch she darted upward at a long slant until the altimeter\nregistered two thousand feet above the sea. And the sea was actually\nbelow them, for Jack had guided the flying machine away out from the\nland.\n\n\"Boys,\" said Professor Henderson, quietly, \"you have done\nwell--remarkably well. I am certainly proud of you. Some day the people\nof the United States will be proud of you. I am sure that the inventor's\ninstinct and the scientist's indefatigable energy are characteristics\nyou both possess.\"\n\n\"That's praise indeed!\" exclaimed Jack, smiling at his chum. \"When the\nprofessor says we've won out, I don't care what anybody else says.\"\n\n\"Do you think the _Snowbird_ is fit for long-distance travel?\" asked\nMark of Professor Henderson, now displaying more eagerness than before.\n\n\"I do indeed. I think you have a most excellent flying machine. I would\nnot hesitate to start for San Francisco in her.\"\n\n\"Or farther?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"Across the ocean?\" queried Mark, quickly.\n\n\"I do not see why any one could not take a trip to the other side of\nthe Atlantic in your 'plane,\" replied the professor. \"With proper\nprecautions, of course.\"\n\nThey reached the land and came safely to rest before the hangar without\nfurther accident. The professor was delighted with the working of his\ncatapult and at once made ready to call the attention of the Navy\nDepartment to his improvement in the means of launching an airship\nfrom the deck of a vessel. Ere he had written to the Department,\nhowever, he and his young friends were suddenly made interested in a\nscheme that was broached by letter to Professor Henderson from a\nfellow-savant, Dr. Artemus Todd, of the West Baden University.\n\nProfessor Henderson and Dr. Todd had often exchanged courtesies; but\nthe university doctor was mainly interested in medical subjects, while\nMr. Henderson delved more in the mysteries of astronomy and practical\nmechanics.\n\nThe doctor's letter to Professor Henderson read as follows:\n\n\"Dear Professor:\n\n\"I am urged to write to you again because of something that has recently\ncome to my knowledge regarding a subject we once discussed. As you\nknow, for some years past I have been investigating not the _cause_\nof aphasia and kindred mental troubles (for we know the condition is\nbrought about by a clot of blood upon the brain), but the means of\nquickly and surely overcoming the condition and bringing the unfortunate\nvictim of this disorder back to his normal state. In our age, when\nmental and nervous diseases are so rapidly increasing, aphasia victims\nare becoming more common. Scarcely a hospital in the land that does\nnot have its quota of such patients under treatment--patients who, in\nmany cases, have completely forgotten who and what they are and have\nassumed a totally different identity from that they began life with.\"\n\n\"We know that, in some cases, hypnotism has benefited the aphasia and\namnesia victim. His condition is not like that of the mentally feeble;\nhe has merely lost his memory of what and who he previously was.\nBelieving that all disease, of whatsoever nature, can be safely treated\nonly through the blood, _this_ ill to which human flesh is heir\nparticularly must be treated in that way, for we know that a stagnant\nstate of the blood in one spot, at least, is the cause of the patient's\nmalady. Therefore I have been experimenting botanically to discover\na remedium for the state in question--something that will act swiftly\nupon the blood, and directly dissipate such a clot as is spoken of\nabove.\"\n\n\"My dear Professor! I can announce with joy that this remedium is\ndiscovered. I obtained a specimen of a very rare plant brought back\nfrom Alaska by a miner who wandered into the fastnesses of the Endicott\nRange, far beyond the usual route of gold miners and in a district\nwhich, I understand, is scarcely ever crossed by whites and which is,\nindeed, almost impassable, even in the summer months. With the aid of\nthis herb--_Chrysothele-Byzantium_ (it was known to the ancients,\nbut very rare)--I have brewed a remedium which, in one case at lest,\ninstantly cleared the blood vessels of the patient and brought him\nback to a knowledge of his real self.\"\n\n\"But my supply of the herb is gone. It reached me in its dry state,\nor I should have first tried to propagate it. It seeds but once in\nseven years and therefore is rare and hard to grow. But I must have\na supply of the _Chrysothele-Byzantium_ seeds, plants, and all.\nI look to you, my dear Professor Henderson, for help. To you space and\nthe flight of time are merely words. You can overcome both if you try.\nI need somebody to go to the northern part of Alaska--that is, beyond\nthe Endicott Range--to obtain this rare plant for me. You have already\nflown over the North Pole and a trip which carries one only three or\nfour degrees beyond the Arctic Circle is a mere bagatelle to you.\"\n\n\"Yes! it is in you I place my hope, Professor. The hopes of many, many\nafflicted people may be placed in you, too. I ask you to fly to this\ndistant place and obtain for me the herb that will do humanity such\ngreat good. Under another enclosure I send you drawings of the plant\nin its several states and a full and complete description of how it\nwas found. You can make no mistake in the _Chrysothele-Byzantium_.\nYou know that I am a cripple, or I would offer to join with you in\nthis search. But at least I am prepared to pay for any expense you may\nbe under. Draw upon me for ten thousand dollars to-morrow if you so\ndesire, and more if you need before the start. The Massachusetts Bay\nTrust Company, of Boston, will honor the draft. Make up the expedition\nas you see fit. Take as many men with you as you think necessary. Make\nall preparations which seem to you fit and needful. I limit you in\nnothing--only bring back the herb.\"\n\n\"Remember I shall impatiently await your return and look for your\nsuccess--I expect nothing but unqualified success from your attempt.\nYou who have achieved so much in the past surely cannot fail me in\nthis event. I await your agreement to attempt this voyage with\nconfidence. I must have the herb and you are the only person who can\nobtain it for me.\"\n\n\"Your friend and co-worker for the betterment of humanity,\n             ARTEMUS TODD, M.D., Ph.D.\"\n\nProfessor Henderson read this strange letter aloud in the evening as\nhe and his friends were sitting before the small, clear fire of hickory\nlogs in the big living room of the bungalow in the woods, built beside\nthe great workshops and laboratory. With the scientist and the two\nboys was Andy Sudds, the old hunter, who sat cleaning his rifle, and\nWashington White was busy in and out of the room as he cleared away\nthe supper and set the place in order.\n\n\"Well! what do you know about that!\" exclaimed Jack Darrow, always\nready with a comment upon any subject. \"Dr. Todd is certainly some in\nearnest; isn't he?\" \"But what a cheek he has to ask you to go on such\na journey!\" cried Mark. \"He talks as though he expected you to start\nimmediately for the Arctic Circle.\"\n\n\"There would be good hunting up there in the mountains,\" said Andy\nSudds, succinctly. \"I wouldn't mind that.\"\n\n\"An'disher chrysomela-bypunktater plant he wants,\" grunted Washington.\n\"Hi, yi! ain't dat de beatenest thing? Who ebber heard of sech a plant\nbefo'?\"\n\n\"Nobody but you, I guess, Washington,\" said the professor, quietly.\n\"_That_ seems to be a plant of your own invention.\"\n\n\"But, sir!\" cried Mark, \"you have no idea of taking this trip he\nsuggests; have you?\"\n\n\"Dr. Todd has done me many a favor in the past,\" said Professor\nHenderson, thoughtfully.\n\n\"Well, if you're going, count me in,\" said Jack, quickly. \"I don't\nmind a summer trip to the Arctic. Say! it can't be much cooler up there\nthan it is here right now. This fire doesn't feel bad at all.\"\n\n\"Humph!\" muttered Mark, who never was as sanguine as his chum. \"This\ncool spell will only last a day or two here; but I understand the tops\nof the Endicott Range are always white.\"\n\n\"B-r-r!\" shivered Washington, at this statement. \"Dis chile don't t'ink\nmuch ob such a surreptitious pedestrianation as dat, den. Don't like\nno cold wedder, nohow! And Buttsy don' like it, needer.\"\n\n\"Who's Buttsy?\" demanded Jack, grinning.\n\n\"Why, fo' suah,\" said the darkey, gravely, \"you knows Christopher\nColumbus Amerigo Vespucci George Washington Abraham Lin----\"\n\n\"But you wouldn't expect to take Christopher Columbus And-so-forth to\nAlaska with us; would you?\" asked Andy Suggs.\n\n\"Why not?\" demanded the darkey. \"He flowed to de moon in de\nperjectilator; didn't he? Huh! In co'se if de perfessor goes after\ndisher chrysomela-bypunktater, I gotter go, too; and in co'se if I go,\nButtsy done gotter go. Dat's as plain as de nose on yo' face, Andy.\"\n\nThe hunter rubbed his rather prominent nasal organ and was silenced.\nJack and Mark had turned more eagerly to the professor as the latter\nbegan to speak:\n\n\"Yes, Dr. Todd is my good friend. He turns to me for help quite\nproperly; who else should he turn to?\"\n\n\"But, Professor!\" ejaculated Mark, warmly. \"Are you to be driven off\nto Alaska at your age to hunt for this herb--which is perhaps only the\nhallucination of a madman?\" \"Mark's hit the nail on the head,\nProfessor!\" declared Jack. \"I believe this Todd must certainly be\n'touched' in his upper story.\"\n\n\"Am _I_ touched, as you call it, Jack?\" demanded Professor Henderson, in\nsome indignation.\n\n\"But you don't believe Todd is on the trail of any great discovery?\"\ncried Mark.\n\n\"Why not? Mind may yield to herbal treatment. Todd is an advanced\nbotanical adherent. He believes almost anything can be accomplished\nby herbs. And he says he has successfully treated one case.\"\n\n\"One swallow doesn't make a summer,\" remarked Mark, doubtfully.\n\n\"But it is enough that he wants us to find the herb,\" said the\nprofessor, more vigorously.\n\n\"'Us'!\" repeated Jack.\n\n\"And he will pay us any reasonable price for our work,\" added their\nmentor.\n\n\"He really means to go!\" cried Mark.\n\n\"I certainly do. I think you and Jack will accompany me,\" said the\nprofessor, quietly. \"I know that Washington will, and of course Andy\nwill not be left behind.\"\n\n\"Not if there'll be a chance at big game,\" declared the hunter. \"I'm\nwith you, Professor Henderson.\"\n\n\"Yo' suah can't git erlong widout me, I s'pose?\" queried the darkey,\nin some uncertainty. \"I'se mighty busy right yere jes' now.\"\n\n\"And you'll be busy if we go to Alaska, Wash!\" cried Jack. \"Hurrah!\nI am willing to start to-morrow, Professor.\"\n\n\"And you, Mark?\" queried the old gentleman of his other adopted son.\n\n\"How will we go, sir? We shall be until fall traveling to the Arctic\nCircle by any usual means.\"\n\n\"True,\" said the professor. \"And haste is imperative. I cannot spend\nmuch time in this matter. We must take unusual means of getting to the\nEndicott Range.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked the boys in chorus.\n\n\"Your _Snowbird_ is ready for flight. It can be provisioned and\nwill take us all quicker than by any other means. Therefore in the\n_Snowbird_ we will make the journey.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTHE FLIGHT OF THE SNOWBIRD\n\nJack Darrow and Mark Sampson were glad enough to be of the party aiming\nto reach northern Alaska and the Endicott Range, if Professor Henderson\nreally intended going to find the strange herb for which Dr. Todd was\nwilling to pay so generously.\n\nOf discussion, pro and con, there was much. Indeed, they sat up until\nafter midnight after the reading of Dr. Todd's letter, talking over\nthe contemplated journey, and gradually the details of the trip,\nincluding all preparations for it, were worked out.\n\nJack and Mark put into the affair, once they were determined to aid\nthe professor, their characteristic energy. Professor Henderson wired\nhis brother scientist that he would undertake the journey to Alaska,\nand accepted the ten thousand dollars to defray expenses. Andy Sudds\nmade characteristic preparations for hunting the big game of the Alaskan\nmountains. Washington White built a traveling coop of very light but\nstrong material for his pet Shanghai, and then announced himself as\nready to depart for the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe instructions and map furnished by Dr. Todd, locating the very spot\nbeyond the Endicott Range where the rare herb had been plucked by the\nminer, showed it to be in a very wild region indeed. There was a native\nsettlement named Aleukan within a hundred miles of the valley where\nthe herb was supposed to grow in abundance. Professor Henderson\ndetermined to lay their course for this place.\n\nBut the nearest white man's town was Coldfoot, on the other side of\nthe mountains. There was a trail, however, passable in summer for a\ndogtrain from Coldfoot to Aleukan; and a dogtrain could likewise pass\nfrom the native village to the valley where the miner had found the\nherb.\n\nThese facts the professor and his young associates discovered as soon\nas Dr. Todd's instructions arrived. They made their plans accordingly.\n\nBy telegraph the professor ordered a trainload of supplies to be started\nat once from Fort Yukon. First, these supplies would go by boat down\nthe Yukon Flats and up the Chandler River, past Chandler and Caro,\nbeyond which latter town there was a good road over a small range of\nhills to Coldfoot. This trail was open at all seasons and there was\na regular system of transportation into Coldfoot.\n\nFrom that town dogs and men would be hired to take the supplies on to\nAleukan. These arrangements were made through an express company, and\nin three days the professor received word that the supplies were already\naboard a small steam vessel which had left the Fort Yukon dock for the\ntrip to Caro.\n\nThe trip by boat and overland for the supply train would consume about\na week or two, providing nothing untoward happened to delay it. And\nthe season was favorable to a quick journey.\n\nBut the professor and his young comrades figured that the _Snowbird_,\nfollowing the shortest air-line to the far side of the Endicott Range,\ncould make the trip in much shorter time. The distance \"as the crow\nflies\" was from 3,700 to 3,800 miles from their point of departure.\nUnder favorable conditions the great flying machine should travel ninety\nmiles an hour on the average. Unless there was a breakdown, or they ran\ninto a heavy storm, which would necessitate their descending to the\nearth, they could count upon the _Snowbird_ being in the vicinity of\nAleukan within three or four days' time at the longest.\n\nIn the flying machine itself they could carry a supply of concentrated\nfoods, medicines, necessities of many kinds, and their arms. It was\nprobable that meat could be had for the killing in the valley to which\nthey were bound, and the Indians at Aleukan could be hired to supply\nnecessary food for a time. But the professor did not propose to take\nhis friends into the wilderness without completely warding off disaster.\n\nConsiderable space in the _Snowbird_ was occupied by Professor\nHenderson's scientific instruments. He was amply supplied with powerful\nfield glasses, a wonderful telescope, partly of his own invention;\ninstruments for the measuring of mountains heights, the recording of\nseismic disturbances, and many other scientific paraphernalia of which\nJack and Mark did not know even the uses.\n\nThe boys were as well supplied with firearms as Andy Sudds himself.\nThey knew that they would probably see and be obliged to kill dangerous\nbeasts; and although the several tribes of Indians inhabiting Alaska\nare all supposed to be semi-civilized and at peace with the whites,\nthey had had experience enough in wild countries before to warn them\nthat the temper of aboriginal man is never to be trusted too far.\n\nTheir own readiness for departure in the _Snowbird_ had been gauged by\nthe telegraph dispatches from Fort Yukon. When the final message came\nthat the boat bearing the supplies had started, Professor Henderson\nasked: \"And now, boys, when can we leave by the air route?\"\n\nJack and Mark glanced at each other and nodded. Jack said:\n\n\"All you have to do, Professor, is to put your bag aboard the ship and\nstep in. We are ready to start the _Snowbird_ at any moment. Andy\nhas his guns aboard, and plenty of ammunition. Mark and I are all\nready. At your word we will leave.\"\n\n\"It is already dark,\" said the professor, slowly. \"Shall we wait until\nmorning?\"\n\n\"The moon will be up in an hour--and it is almost at its full,\" Mark\nsaid, quickly. \"The quicker we are off the better, it seems to me.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" agreed Professor Henderson. \"If you boys say the word, we\nwill start. Is Andy here?\"\n\n\"He is already aboard--asleep in his bunk,\" said Jack, \"with his best\nrifle cuddled in the hollow of his arm. He does not propose to be left\nbehind,\" and the young fellow chuckled.\n\n\"And where is Washington White?\"\n\n\"He's done yere,\" answered the darkey for himself, and he appeared\nbearing the traveling coop of Christopher Columbus And-so-forth in his\narms.\n\n\"Here, Wash!\" ejaculated Jack. \"Surely you are not going to clutter\nup the flying machine with that thing?\"\n\n\"An' why fo' not?\" sputtered the darkey. \"Whatebber has Buttsy done\nter yo', Massa Jack, dat yo' should be obfendicated at his 'pearance\nin de present state ob de obsequies?\"\n\n\"Then the rooster accompanies the expedition,\" chuckled Jack. \"Only\nremember, if we have to throw out anything to lighten ship, Buttsy\ngoes first--even before we are obliged to dispense with _your_ services,\nWash!\"\n\n\"Den we are ready to start,\" declared the darkey, solemnly. \"Nottin'\nwill now disturb de continuity ob de ebenin's enj'yment. Forward,\nmarch, is our motter!\"\n\nAnd he marched away to the flying machine and got aboard with the coop\nand Buttsy in his arms.\n\nThe professor had found the last of his possessions he wished to take\nwith him. He followed the negro aboard. The _Snowbird_ was already\noutside the hangar and on its wheels, ready for the start. This time\nthey dispensed with the professor's catapult, for it would be necessary\nto have the trucks attached to the aeroplane to enable her to start\nproperly from any point on which they might land. The workshop and\nplant in general were left in charge of a watchman and caretaker, and\nonly this man was present when Jack took his place in the controller's\nseat and Mark started the powerful motor and clambered aboard.\n\nThe craft ran across the field, at first slowly and then more rapidly\nas Jack increased the speed. The flying machine began to lift almost\nimmediately.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted the irrepressible Jack. \"We're off!\"\n\n\"About nor-norwest is the course, Jack,\" cried Mark Sampson, likewise\ninspired by the flight of the _Snowbird_.\n\nAs for Washington White, he gazed down to the dusky earth below them\nand his eyes rolled.\n\n\"Gollyation!\" he muttered. \"If Buttsy should fall down dere, he'd suah\njounce himself some; wouldn't he?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\"WHO GOES THERE?\"\n\nWith the moonlight lying like a benediction over the fields and forests\nof Maine, the _Snowbird_, her motor humming like a huge bumble-bee,\nand her propellers and controls working in perfect order, swept on her\ncourse into the northwest. The lights of Easton, ten miles from their\nhome, melted into the earth-shadow behind the sky-voyagers within the\nfirst hour of the sure-to-be eventful journey.\n\nJack Darrow did not force the pace of the flying machine. They had a\nlong and trying flight before them. The machine as a whole had been\ntried out only two or three times during the few days that had elapsed\nsince she was completed and this present expedition had been planned.\nThese short flights had served merely to put the parts in good working\ntrim; but the lad knew better than to make the pace that of top-speed\nfrom the start.\n\nHe wanted her to \"warm up.\" He knew that the _Snowbird_ could make one\nhundred twenty-five miles an hour. But such speed was likely to shake\nsomething loose and cripple the mechanism.\n\nA flight of seventy or eighty miles an hour would bring them well into\nCanada by noon of the next day. They would have to there descend at,\nor near, some town, and report themselves and the nature of their\nflight to the authorities. This was to be done as a precaution in case\nthey had a breakdown somewhere in crossing British possessions. A\npassport would then aid them if they were obliged to call upon the\nauthorities in the heart of Canada for aid.\n\nBut at present none of these things bothered the party much. Sudds and\nthe professor slept as though they were in their beds at home. The old\nhunter could sleep anywhere, and awake instantly with all his faculties\nabout him. And the scientist slept profoundly because his body was\nexhausted.\n\nUnder the brilliant moon the _Snowbird_ swung along the air-way like a\nveritable bird. Jack increased the revolutions of the propellers\na trifle and the ship responded like a spirited horse to the spur. She\ndarted ahead at a ninety mile speed and Washington White emitted a\nmournful groan.\n\n\"What's the matter with you now, Wash?\" shouted Mark, for they all\nwore ear-tabs and had to shout to make one another hear.\n\n\"Oh, lawsy-massy on us!\" groaned Wash. \"I'se got sech a misery, Massa\nMark, I dunno but ma time has camed.\"\n\n\"What time has come?\" demanded Mark, without much sympathy. \"It'll be\ntime for you to hustle and get us something to eat before long.\"\n\n\"For de goodness gracious Agnes' sake!\" gasped the negro, \"yo' suahly\nain't a-gwine ter dribe me ter wo'k up in disher flyin' contraption?\nDat would suah be cruelty ter animiles, boy--it suah would!\"\n\n\"We've got to eat, Wash,\" said Jack, chuckling, \"and you are steward\nand cook of this craft.\"\n\n\"Gollyation! did I ship fo' sech wo'k? I nebber knowed it. It does\nseem to me dat de consanguinity ob de 'casion done call fo' notting\nbut de quietest kind o' verisimilitude. De qualmishness dat arises in\nde interiorness of ma diaphragm ev'ry time I circumnavigates erbout\nin disher flyin' ship makes me wanter express mahself in de mos'\nscatterin' kin' ob er way--I hopes you gits ma meanin' clear?\"\n\nJack was laughing so that he could not speak, but Mark managed to say:\n\n\"You mean that the motion of the aeroplane gives you a feeling of _mal\nde mer_?\"\n\n\"Dat's wot I done said,\" Wash replied, seriously. \"I nebber in ma life\nfelt so mal-der-merry as I do at dis present onauspicious 'casion; an'\nif dat mal don't stop merryin' purty quick, I suah shall be--ugh!--sick\nter ma stummick!\"\n\nThis wail fairly convulsed Jack Darrow and Mark Sampson; but they knew\nthat if Wash paid more attention to his duties and thought less about\nhis own situation he would be better off. Mark insisted on his going\nat once into the tiny, covered \"galley,\" as the boys called it, hung\namidships, in which were the means of heating water, making coffee,\nand cooking certain simple viands in their stores.\n\nWash went to his duties grumblingly; but he was an ingenious and\nskillful cook and when he got to work he forgot his \"feeling of\nmal-de-merry.\"\n\nIt was now approaching midnight and the flying machine had been steadily\ntraveling northward for some hours. Both Andy Sudds and the professor\nawoke and offered to relieve the boys in their work. But Mark had taken\nJack's place in the controller's seat and neither he nor his chum felt\nthat he wished to give over the guidance of the _Snowbird_ to anybody\nelse.\n\nNow, some distance ahead, the peak of Mt. Katahdin, gloriously mantled\nin moonlight, rose before them. Their direct course lay over the summit\nof this eminence, and Mark decided that it would be better to rise to\na higher strata and cross the mountain than to swing around it.\nTherefore Mark raised the bow of the flying machine and she darted\nupward on a long slant, drawing ever nearer to the shining peak of the\ngreat mountain. The night air was chill--it had been cool when they\nleft the earth--and as they rose to the rarer ether it was evident\nthat they would find a degree of temperature far lower than the usual\nsummer heat.\n\nMark kept the _Snowbird_ scaling swiftly upward, mile after mile; but\nthe long tangent at which he had started to clear the summit of Katahdin\ndid not prove sufficient, and by and by they found themselves within a\nvery few yards of the rocky side of the peak.\n\nOut of a dark glen a spark of light suddenly shot--almost like a rocket\nin swiftness. Jack saw it first and cried:\n\n\"See that! What is it? What do you make of it?\"\n\n\"A shootin' star, I declare!\" said Andy Sudds.\n\n\"Nothing of the kind,\" exclaimed Jack, quickly. \"A star could not shoot\nup from the earth.\"\n\n\"Wot's dat says somebody's a-shootin' at us?\" gasped Washington White.\n\"If dey punctuates our tire, we'll suah go down wid a big ker-smash!\"\n\nThe professor, however, watched the \"shooting star\" for some moments\nwithout speaking, and then rapidly made his way to Mark's side.\n\n\"Send your 'plane up in spirals, boy!\" he commanded. \"Don't let that\nlight rise over us. Be quick, now!\"\n\n\"What is it, Professor?\" asked young Sampson, as he obeyed the\nscientist's injunction.\n\n\"I am sure it is a light in the bow of another airship--but what manner\nof ship she is, or who drives her, I cannot guess,\" declared Professor\nHenderson, gravely.\n\n\"Another airship!\" cried Jack, who overheard him. \"What do you know\nabout that?\"\n\nMark handled the _Snowbird_ with great skill, and the powerful craft\nmounted much more swiftly than the distant spark of light. The spiral\ncourse the 'plane now followed carried it at times much farther from the\nmountain side than it had been when first the strange light was noticed.\nThat light followed the _Snowbird_ up and up in similar spirals, and the\nboys were soon convinced that Professor Henderson's discovery was a\nfact. The lamp was in the bow of another air craft.\n\n\"But why should we keep over them?\" asked Jack. \"There is no danger; is\nthere?\"\n\n\"We do not know who they are,\" said the professor, shortly. \"The craft\ncame right out of a fastness in the mountain-side--a place difficult\nto reach, and which would not seem to attract aviators of the ordinary\nclass.\" \"I know what he is thinking of,\" cried Mark, suddenly. \"I read\nin the paper that the Department of Justice officers are after some\nbig smugglers and that it is believed the criminals, in going back and\nforth into Canada, use some kind of an aerial craft. Isn't that so,\nProfessor Henderson?\"\n\n\"I had the fact in mind. The flying machine is being put already to\nuses that are not commendable, to say the least. The Maine and Canadian\nborder has for years been used by bands of smugglers, and if one of\nthese gangs have purchased and can use a flying craft, they may make\nthe revenue men a deal of trouble.\"\n\n\"You're right, sir. And I read likewise that the government officers\nproposed using an aeroplane themselves to track the smugglers. Perhaps\nthe villains, if that is their ship below us, may take us for secret\nservice men.\"\n\nAs he spoke the lamp so far below them darted up at a sudden and sharp\nangle, there sounded the sharp crack of some weapon, and Washington\nWhite jumped and screamed.\n\n\"Gollyation!\" he bawled. \"Dem fellers is suah tryin' ter punctuate us!\"\n\nThrough the blackness of the night a distant voice hailed the pilot\nof the _Snowbird_.\n\n\"Ahoy! ahoy! Who goes there?\" was the cry, and it was repeated twice.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nBETWEEN TWO PERILS\n\nMark Sampson, having all the mechanism of the flying machine under his\nimmediate control, had it in his power to increase speed and seek to\nescape the second airship. And Jack wondered why his chum did not\nimmediately send the _Snowbird_ flying at increased speed over the top\nof Mt. Katahdin and so seek to escape the menace below.\n\nBut the young fellow at the controls of the _Snowbird_ had an advantage\nover his companions that Jack had forgotten. He could hear sounds at a\nmuch greater distance than they, and much clearer.\n\nThis was because of an invention of Professor Henderson--a small\ninstrument similar to part of the ordinary telephone. The sensitive\ndisk was a form of radio receiver which could be attached to any\naviator's helmet, and was being put into general use by pilots. The\ntwo boys always adjusted this whenever they were strapped upon the\npilot's seat.\n\nThus, although the report of the gun had sounded but faintly to the\nother members of the party, to Mark it seemed as though the explosion\nwas within a hundred yards. The voice hailing them likewise seemed to\nring in his ears very plainly; and beyond the words somewhat\ndistinguished by his companions the young operator of the _Snowbird_\ncould make out a further phrase spoken by the person who hailed from the\nother air-craft.\n\n\"Halt in the name of the law!\"\n\nThose were the sharp words Mark had caught, and for that reason he\nhesitated to increase the _Snowbird's_ speed.\n\nIn a strap hung near his left hand was a transmitter. Without taking\nthe advice of any of his companions in the flying machine, Mark seized\nit, put it to his lips, and replied to the hail:\n\n\"Ahoy! what do you want?\"\n\nInstantly the voice rose from the black abyss below them:\n\n\"Heave to! Stop in the name of the law!\"\n\nThat time the professor and Jack heard the words spoken by their\npursuer.\n\n\"What do you know about that?\" demanded Jack. \"'In the name of the law',\nno less!\"\n\nProfessor Henderson jumped to the same conclusion that Mark had, and\nthat instantly. \"It may be the Secret Service men themselves,\" he said.\n\"Ah, Andrew! it is just as well to withhold your fire until we know\nfor sure.\"\n\nFor Andy Sudds had seized his rifle and stood ready to withstand an\nattack, should such an act become necessary.\n\nUp from the depths came the cry again:\n\n\"Hold your ship. I propose to come aboard and search her. In the name\nof the United States Government!\"\n\nMr. Henderson took the radio telephone out of Mark's hand and replied:\n\n\"We wish to know who and what you really are. We will not put ourselves\nin your power without knowing. We are amply armed.\"\n\n\"Don't you dare to fire upon a United States officer in the discharge\nof his duty,\" cried the voice from below, and now the strange airship\nwas much nearer to them. \"Who do you claim to be?\"\n\n\"This is the _Snowbird_, from Easton, Maine, She is manned by her\nbuilders, Darrow and Sampson. She carries as passengers Washington\nWhite, Andrew Sudds and Amos Henderson,\" declared the professor, in\nreply. \"And she is bound for Alaska.\"\n\n\"Well, well!\" exclaimed the voice of their pursuer. \"That may all be\nso. But I have my suspicions. I am Ford, special agent of the Department\nof Justice. Stand by. Now I am coming aboard.\"\n\nAt a nod from the professor, Mark had already brought the _Snowbird_ to\na halt. She lay floating, with all planes extended and without motion of\npropellers, poised over the summit of Mt. Katahdin.\n\nThe descending moon threw its beams over the height and revealed to\nthe vaguely anxious occupants of the _Snowbird_, the other machine\ndarting up from below.\n\nThis was a craft of much different aspect from their own. It was a\ngreat deal smaller and apparently without half the power possessed by\nthe one built by Jack and Mark.\n\nShe shot into the air above their heads at a swift pace, however, and\nimmediately poised over them. In this attitude Ford, as he called\nhimself, had the occupants of the _Snowbird_ completely at his\nmercy. A bomb dropped upon the huge flying machine would have blown\nher to pieces. Or, with a gun, he could have picked off one after\nanother of the five people below.\n\n\"Stand out of the way, there!\" commanded Ford.\n\nInstantly those upon the larger air-craft saw a figure swing down from\nthe framework of the airship above their heads. A light rope ladder\nunrolled and fell upon the upper deck, or platform of the _Snowbird_,\nand the man came down this ladder, hand under hand, and in half a minute\nstood in their midst.\n\nHe was a small, gray man--gray suit, gray hair and close-cropped\nmustache, and gray face, colorless and deeply lined. His age would be\nhard to judge.\n\n\"The _Snowbird_; eh?\" he observed, looking sharply from one to the other\nof the five passengers of the huge flying machine. \"_You_ are Amos\nHenderson, sir?\" he pursued, nodding to the professor. \"I believe I have\nheard your name before. Professor Henderson, whose scientific\ndiscoveries have made us all marvel of late?\"\n\n\"I am Professor Henderson,\" said the old gentleman, quietly. \"And I\ncan vouch for my companions. These boys, my adopted sons, have built\nthis flying machine, and we are bound for Alaska.\"\n\n\"Indeed! Then I fear I have caused you some slight trouble, not to say\ndelay,\" said Mr. Ford. \"We revenue agents are extremely anxious to\noverhaul and interview all aviators along the border. You understand?\"\n\n\"I believe that you have cause to suspect certain flying machines\noperating between the Canadian towns and Maine settlements,\" admitted\nProfessor Henderson. \"Quite right. And if our suspicions are based on\nfact, innocent flying men like yourselves may well beware of the fellows\nwe are after. To be frank with you,\" pursued Mr. Ford, \"a band of\ndesperate smugglers are operating by aid of one or more aeroplanes.\nAnd piracy in the air may soon became as frequent--and as grave a peril\nto innocent aviators--as was ever piracy on the Spanish Main.\"\n\n\"It seems impossible!\" said the professor. \"Who are these desperate\ncriminals?\"\n\n\"A man named Bainbridge is at their head. He was originally a diamond\ndealer and finally was caught smuggling gems into the port of New York.\nHe had to pay a huge fine and served a term at Atlanta for that crime\nand since then has sworn to be revenged upon the Government that\npunished him.\n\n\"We learned of late that he was operating on the Mexican\nborder--bringing into the States diamonds that had paid no duty--by\naid of a flying machine. But the uprising in Chihuahua and along the\nborder made his work exceedingly dangerous, and he was driven away\nfrom that part of the country.\n\n\"Now we believe he has joined forces hereabout with ancient enemies\nof the Federal officers. At least, there is a strange aeroplane reported\nfrom both sides of the border, and some fine gems have appeared in the\nhands of certain suspected dealers in Maine, and as far south as Boston\nand Providence.\n\n\"Bainbridge is known to be a desperate man. Look out for him, Professor.\nIf you are hailed by another machine, better keep away from it,\" and\nthe secret service agent laughed. \"Had I been in your place I would\nnot have halted on this occasion. You certainly can outsail any airship\nI have ever seen operated.\"\n\nMr. Ford seemed quite satisfied that our friends were law-abiding and\nhe ascended to his waiting craft in a few moments; and the _Snowbird_\nstarted onward again through the starlight.\n\nBut the warning of the special agent had impressed the boys as well\nas the professor. Andy Sudds refused to lie down again, although Jack\nand Mark continued to operate the flying machine. The old hunter sat\nwith a rifle in his hand for the rest of the night. But the professor\nwent to bed.\n\nAn hour after midnight a cloud from the west completely masked the\nmoon and the whole heavens became misty. This cloud brought both wind\nand rain, and low upon its edge the lightning played fitfully.\n\n\"There will be a heavy tempest about dawn,\" Andy promised the boys.\n\"I have seen a thunderstorm gather like this before.\" \"But not while\nyou were in a flying machine,\" chuckled Jack.\n\n\"No, sir. But on a mountain top a tempest looks much the same.\"\n\nMark, while at the controls, had scaled the machine down the air-ways\nuntil they were not more than fifteen hundred feet from the earth. But\nthe boys decided to let the storm gather beneath them, and so shot the\n_Snowbird_ up again until the indicator registered three thousand feet.\n\nNear the earth it must have been very warm and sultry; but up here it\nwas down to freezing, and the party were all warmly dressed. The clouds\nsoon hid the whole earth from them and the great flying machine traveled\nin space, with the star-lit heavens above and the rolling mass of\nvapor, streaked now and then with lightning flashes, beneath.\n\nThe deafening roll of the thunder awoke Washington White from a short\nnap, and the darkey was not at all sure that he was safe from the\nlightning bolts.\n\n\"How d'I know dem bolts won't fly disher way?\" he demanded of the boys\nwhen they tried to reassure him.\n\n\"Why, the earth attracts the electric bolt, and that attraction is\nmuch stronger than any the _Snowbird_ may have for the electricity\nin the clouds,\" Mark told him. \"I don't know erbout dat,\" grumbled\nWash. \"An' if jest one o' dem crazy lightning bolts should take it\ninto its haid ter segastuate eround disher flying merchine--biff! bang!\ndat would be erbout all. Dere would be a big bunch o' crape hung on\nWash White's do', suah as you is bawn, boy!\"\n\nBut although the roar of the thunder and whining of the wind nearly\ndrowned other sounds in and about the flying machine, save for a\nfreshening of the gale the _Snowbird_ was at first but little\ndisturbed by the tempest which raged with such fury a thousand feet\nbelow.\n\nSuddenly Mark caught sight of something moving across the red streak\nin the eastern sky--the light that warned them of the approach of the\nsun.\n\n\"What is that--a huge bird?\" he demanded of Andy Sudds, pointing this\nmoving figure out to the hunter.\n\nAndy's eyes were very keen, for he was used to sighting along a rifle\nand gazing over long distances in search of game. But he, too, thought\nthe object must be a bird.\n\n\"I declare, I didn't know birds flew so high,\" said Mark. \"It must be\nan eagle. No other fowl could fly so high.\"\n\n\"'Nless it were Buttsy,\" remarked Washington, _sotto voce_. The\nprofessor was still asleep and the boys paid little attention to the\nflying object for some time. It was coming up behind the _Snowbird_, and\nthey had no occasion to look behind.\n\nThe sun arose, angry and red, while the thunder continued to roll below\nthem, and the crackling of the electric flashes was like minute guns.\nThe _Snowbird_ was winging its way along at about seventy-five\nmiles per hour. Wash had gone into the covered galley to prepare\nbreakfast. Jack was still in the operator's seat.\n\nSuddenly Andy Sudds uttered a loud shout. A huge shadow was thrown\nathwart the flying _Snowbird_. Some object was hovering over them\nand they cast their eyes upward, at Andy's cry, to see another aeroplane\nswooping down directly upon them.\n\nIt was not the machine manned by Secret Service Agent Ford and his\ncompanion, but a much heavier and more rapid vehicle. And until its\nshadow fell across the _Snowbird_, the boys had had no warning of its\napproach.\n\nAt first glance it was apparent that the strange aircraft intended\nmischief. It was shooting down from a higher level, its sharp bow aimed\ndirectly for the _Snowbird_. Jack pushed over the switch and raised the\nbow of their own ship. She leaped forward and began to slant upward,\ntoo.\n\nBut instantly the course of the stranger was deflected to meet this\nchange in the movement of the _Snowbird_. She had the advantage of the\nboys' craft, too. She evidently proposed to retain her overhead\nposition, and as she shot in closer, Jack was constrained to descend\nagain to escape collision with her.\n\n\"Keep away!\" he shouted through the transmitter, and at his cry, and\nthe bustle about him, the professor was awakened.\n\nBut no reply came from the strange aeroplane, although they could see\nseveral figures moving upon her. It swooped down upon them, and Jack\nhad to deflect his planes again and slant downward toward the\nstorm-cloud.\n\nAnd then he saw the other peril. He was between two great dangers. If\nthe reckless aviator tried to ram him from above, his only escape was\nby plunging through the tempest which raged just below them.\n\nDown came the stranger upon the _Snowbird_ again. She surely meant\nthem ill--she was bent on their destruction. And meanwhile the thunder\nroared below and the crackling of the lightning was almost incessant.\n\nJack Darrow had to decide quickly--and he must determine which of the\ntwo risks to take.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nON THE WINGS OF THE WIND\n\nSpeedy as the _Snowbird_ was, she could not get out from under the\nshadow of the strange aeroplane. That was driven at a sharp angle down\nupon the boys' flying machine, and it seemed to all those in the lower\n'plane that a collision was imminent.\n\nThe thunder fairly deafened them all. Around them rolled the mists and\nthe wind shrieked through the stays of the aeroplane and shook the\nstructure like a dog worrying a bone.\n\nDown they fell, and in an instant the rushing rain, emptied in a torrent\nfrom the clouds, swept about them, saturating their garments and beating\nthe flying machine itself toward the distant earth.\n\nDuring the next few moments Jack Darrow, Mark Sampson, and their\ncompanions were in as grave peril as had ever threatened them in their\neventful lives.\n\nThe torrents of water all but beat the flying machine to the earth--and\nto be dashed down from such a height spelled death to all and\ndestruction to the aeroplane.\n\nJack, however, had been taught to keep cool in moments of danger, and\nhe realized that their lives depended entirely upon his handling of\nthe great machine. They had descended below the level of the storm-cloud\nat a most inopportune moment. They were caught in the midst of a\nveritable cloudburst.\n\nShaken desperately by the wind, and beaten upon by tons upon tons of\nwater, it was a wonder that the great planes, or wings, of the flying\nmachine were not torn away. All Jack could do was to guide her the\nbest he could, and all his companions could do was to cling to a slender\nhope and endure the lashing of the gale.\n\nBut Jack Darrow did not propose to be cast to the ground--and the\nflying machine and his friends with him--without some further attempt\nto avert such a catastrophe.\n\nAfter the first breath-taking rush of the storm he diverted the course\nof the machine again upward. He could scarcely see, the driving rain\nwas so blinding; nor could he observe the indicators before him with\nany clearness. But he was quite sure that the enemy that had driven\nhim down into the storm-cloud could see the _Snowbird_ no better than he\ncould see that strange aeroplane that had threatened to collide with\nthem.\n\nSo he shot the _Snowbird_ upward again at a long slant, and put on all\nthe power of the engine to drive her onward. The flying machine shook\nand throbbed in every part. The power of the engines would have driven\nher, under other and more favorable conditions, at more than one hundred\nmiles an hour--possibly a hundred and twenty-five.\n\nJack himself was almost blinded and deafened. He was strapped to his\nseat, so could give both hands to the work of manipulating the levers.\nHe brought the _Snowbird_ through the cloud and--with startling\nsuddenness--they shot out of the mass of rolling moisture and into the\nsunlight of the dawn. But they were far off their course.\n\nThe change from the chaos of the storm-cloud to the almost perfect\ncalm of the upper ether was so great that it was almost stunning. For\na minute none of the five spoke a word.\n\nThen it was Mark who shouted:\n\n\"There's that 'plane again, Jack I Look out for her!\"\n\nThe enemy had missed them. She was some miles away, and although still\non a level above, at the pace the _Snowbird_ was now traveling it would\ntake a fast flying machine indeed to overtake her.\n\nThe pursuit of the enemy (which they all believed to be the smuggler,\nmanned by Bainbridge and his friends) was not kept up for long. By\neight o'clock the _Snowbird_ had dropped the other machine below\nthe horizon, and the swift pace at which they had driven the _Snowbird_\nwas rapidly bringing them once more toward Canada.\n\nThe storm had broken, but the clouds still hovered below them. They\ndescended about noon, passing harmlessly through the vapor which had\nso long hidden the earth from them, and so came to within a thousand\nfeet of the ground, where they swung along at fair speed for some\nhours.\n\nThey crossed the line, but did not descend until near St. Thomas. They\nwent out of their way a good bit to land near this town on the shore\nof the St. Lawrence, for the flying machine had been so shaken in its\nstruggle with the thunderstorm that some repairs were needed.\n\nThey descended in a field on the edge of the town, gave the farmer who\nowned the place a five-dollar bill to allow the machine to stand on\nhis land, and then engaged him to drive Professor Henderson and the\nboys into town.\n\nWhile the professor saw the authorities and obtained a legal document\nrecommending the exploring party to the good offices of all\nBritish-Canadian officers whom they might meet, the boys went to a\nmachine shop to have a rod repaired. The party took supper with the\nfarmer, and an hour later the flying machine being pronounced by both\nMark and Jack in perfect order, they got off amid the cheers of the\nonlookers, whose numbers were by that time swelled to almost five\nhundred persons.\n\nIt was long after dark and the moon had not risen. It was a cloudless\nnight, however, and as the flying machine soared heavenward the voyagers\ncould look deep into the seeming black-velvet of the skies, picked out\nby the innumerable sparkling stars, and thought they had never seen\nso wonderful or beautiful a sight.\n\nAs they cast their gaze downward, too, they beheld the torches at the\nCanadian farm rapidly receding, and then, in a few minutes, they were\nflying over St. Thomas, where the lights twinkled, too. Then they shot\nover the broad, island-dotted bosom of the St. Lawrence River, and so\non across country and town toward the vast Canadian wilderness.\n\nThe professor and Andy had the watch and Jack and Mark went to bed.\nThe excitement of the previous twenty-four hours had kept the boys up;\nbut once they closed their eyes, they slept like logs all night. Andy\nSudds relieved the professor now and then in the operator's seat, and\nthey did not call the boys until Washington White made breakfast at\ndaybreak. By that time the _Snowbird_ had passed Lake St. John, far to\nthe north and east, and was heading for Hudson Bay. The earth below them\nwas a checker-board of forest and field, with here and there a ribbon of\nriver, and occasionally a group of farmsteads, or a small town. Suddenly\nthey were forced down, and had to remain many hours for repair work\nbefore ascending again.\n\nThe ranges of hills--some of them dignified enough to be termed\n\"mountains\"--which they crossed necessitated their flying high. They\nwere generally at an altitude of two thousand feet and the rarefied\natmosphere so far above the earth was cool, anyway. Since leaving St.\nThomas, on the bank of the St. Lawrence, they had averaged eighty miles\nan hour, and before moonrise they were cognizant of the fact that they\nwere approaching a great sheet of water.\n\n\"St. James Bay, the lower part of Hudson Bay,\" Professor Henderson\nexplained.\n\nSoon the moonlight shimmered upon the waves beneath them. Jack, who\nwas guiding the craft, deflected the wings and they slid down the\nairways toward the water. They traveled all night over this great\ninland sea, at times so close to the surface that the leaping waves\nsprinkled them with their spray--for there was a stiff breeze.\n\nA gale broke in earnest over the Hudson Bay territory that day, and\ndespite the efforts of the voyagers they could not rise in the\n_Snowbird_ above the tempest. Had there been solid ground beneath\nthem they could easily have descended and remained upon terra firma\nuntil the storm was past.\n\nThis gale was favorable to their course, but it gripped them in its\ngiant grasp and hurled them on into the northwest at a speed that\nimperiled the safety of the flying machine each moment. There was no\nsleep for any of the party now, and Washington White came pretty near\n(as Jack said) \"making good his name in his face\"--for if ever a darkey\nof Wash's ebony complexion turned pale, the professor's servant did\nso at this juncture.\n\nOn and on they were driven hour after hour. Scarcely a word was spoken\nthe entire time. There was no cessation of the gale. The great body\nof water was passed and they knew that there was land beneath them\nagain. But each time they tried to descend they found the storm near\nthe earth-crust far heavier than at the upper levels.\n\nTo descend through the belt of the storm might partially wreck their\nflying machine and the professor knew, by the study of his recording\ninstruments, that they were passing over an utter wilderness in which\nno help could be obtained and from which, should they be wrecked, they\ncould not escape before the rigorous Arctic winter set in.\n\nHour after hour they drove on. The speed of the _Snowbird_ at times,\nwhen driven by the full force of the gale, had mounted to one hundred\nthirty miles an hour.\n\nGreat Slave Lake was far south of their route; yet the professor told\nthem that, had it been clear, at the altitude they traveled, they could\nhave seen and marked this great body of water.\n\nThey actually crossed the Great Bear Lake and the Mackenzie River,\nhowever, and saw the ragged peaks of the Rocky Mountains, which here\nalmost touch the shores of the Arctic Sea. Blown on and on, with little\ndiminution of speed, it was not many hours before the _Snowbird_ was\nflying over Alaskan wilds. The flying machine had kept closely to the\ncourse the professor had laid out for her when they left Maine. They\nwere still headed for the slopes of the Endicott Range and the native\ntown of Aleukan.\n\nThe question paramount in all their minds, however, was this: Would\nthey reach their destination in safety?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nDROPPED FROM THE SKY\n\n\nA thick mantle of fog masked the heavens; but beneath this the\nwind--traveling at great velocity--drove the ragged clouds like\nfrightened sheep across the pastures of the firmament.\n\nThe moon and stars gave so little light that the earth seemed but a\nvague and shadowy mass--nothing more. The wind shrieked in many voices,\nas though a troop of goblins raced through the air, or rode the\nstrangely formed and hurrying clouds.\n\nDriven on with the tumbling banks of vapor, as vaguely outlined in the\ngloom as the clouds themselves, was the great flying machine, which\nthe wind buffeted and harried about as though against it Old Boreas\nhad some special spite.\n\nJack was in the operator's seat; but there was little to do but hang\non to the steering wheel. The wind blew them as it listed.\n\n\"I don't well see how anybody can sleep in this horrid storm,\"\ncomplained Mark Sampson. \"And the machine rocks so--ugh! I'm as sick\nas though we were at sea.\" \"And we are pretty completely 'at sea,'\"\nchuckled the more volatile Jack. \"I hope the professor knows where we\nare. _I_ don't!\"\n\n\"And I don't see how he can tell,\" grumbled his chum.\n\n\"Pluck up your spirits, old man!\" returned the older lad, but Mark\ninterrupted him, still crossly:\n\n\"I hope I am as courageous as the next. We've done some funny stunts\ntogether, Jack Darrow--you and I and the old professor. But this caps\nthem all, I declare. It's a mystery to me how Mr. Henderson and Andy\nSudds can remain asleep.\"\n\n\"Well, they are both tired out, I reckon. They had a long watch--and\n_we_ slept, you know.\"\n\n\"That was a long time ago,\" grunted Mark,\n\n\"It's pretty tough, I admit,\" said Jack, when Washington White broke\nin with:\n\n\"Hi, yi! Whuffo' you boys be sech cowards? Is _I_ skeert? Huh!\"\n\n\"You bet you're scared,\" returned Jack, emphatically. \"When we got\ncaught in that flaw yesterday afternoon he wanted to jump out; didn't\nhe, Mark?\"\n\n\"Wash certainly tried to climb out,\" rejoined Mark.\n\"Well, den! dat showed I warn't no coward,\" crowed the black man,\nthough in a very shaky voice. \"If I'd been scart', would I really have\nwanted ter jump? It was a might long way to de groun' right den, I\nguess.\"\n\nSuddenly the Shanghai crowed loudly.\n\"Tell yo' what!\" cried the black man, scratching his head. \"Dat rooster\ndone crow fo' company.\"\n\n\"Company!\" gasped Mark. \"What does he think he hears up here--angels'\nwings? We're about as near being in the company of the celestial hosts\nas we'll ever be and remain alive, I reckon.\"\n\n\"No, sah!\" retorted Washington. \"Dat Shanghai done know dat we is near\nsome oder fow-el----\"\n\n\"Up here in the air, Wash?\" cried Jack.\n\n\"Dunno whar dey is,\" said the darkey, doggedly. \"Dar he crows ergin!\nDar is suttenly critters ob his kind nearby--yes--sah!\"\n\nIt may have been the Shanghai's raucous tone that aroused Andy. The\nold hunter suddenly appeared on the platform behind the operator's\nseat, where the boys and Wash were clinging, and Andy brought his rifle\nwith him.\n\n\"Hullo!\" he said. \"Is the watch called?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry if we awoke you, Andy,\" Jack said. \"There is nothing for you\nto do.\"\n\n\"Nothing to shoot at; eh?\" said the old hunter. \"I reckon I ain't of\nmuch use in a flying machine, anyway. Sort of 'up in the air'; ain't\nI?\"\n\n\"That's where we all are,\" complained Mark. \"And I, for one, wish we\nwere down again.\"\n\n\"Guess we're all with you in that wish, old man,\" agreed Jack.\n\nAs he spoke, the wind-blown figure of the professor hove into view\nfrom the small, sheltered cabin. He glanced at the various indicators\nand the compass in front of Jack.\n\n\"We are all in safety yet; are we, boys?\" he queried.\n\n\"If you can call being driven helplessly before such a gale and about\na mile above the earth _safe_,\" retorted Mark.\n\n\"Surely not as high as that,\" exclaimed Professor Henderson. He examined\nthe instruments again, and said, quickly: \"We are descending! How is\nthat, Jack?\"\n\n\"Not with my knowledge, sir,\" returned the boy aviator. \"I think we\nhave remained on the thousand-foot level since crossing the Rocky\nMountains.\"\n\n\"I believe you have been faithful, my boy,\" returned the professor,\nquickly. \"But the earth is certainly less than three hundred feet below\nus--ah! see that? The indicator registers 250 feet. Now 240!\" \"We are\nfalling!\" cried Mark.\n\n\"No!\" said the professor. \"The earth is rising. We are being blown\nagainst the mountainside. We must be within a few hundred miles, at\nleast, of our destination. Those are the Endicott Mountains yonder,\"\nand he waved a hand at the darkness to the south of them.\n\n\"Hark!\" cried Andy Sudds, suddenly.\n\nThere was a momentary lull in the wind. From below came the broken\ncrowing of a cock in answer to the Shanghai's challenge. Then a dog\nbarked.\n\n\"There's a farmhouse down there,\" said the hunter.\n\n\"What did I tell yo'?\" cried Washington White. \"Dat Buttsy knows his\nbusiness, all right!\"\n\n\"We must descend,\" commanded the professor. \"Deflect the planes, Jack.\nWatch the indicator. Reduce the speed. Let us float down as easily as\npossible.\"\n\nBut, wrestling as the flying machine was with the wind, she could not\ndescend easily. She scaled earthward with fearful velocity. The\nirrepressible Jack yelled:\n\n\"Go-ing down! We're going to bump hard in a minute!\"\n\nThe aged professor and Andy Sudds showed no perturbation. Jack and\nMark had been through so many wonderful experiences with the professor,\nAndy, and the negro, that they were not likely to be panic-stricken. Yet\nall realized that death was imminent.\n\nThe finger on the dial showed a hundred feet from earth, and still\nthey descended. Fifty feet!\n\n\"Hold hard!\" commanded the professor. \"We'll be down in a minute.\"\n\nThere seemed to be a break in the hurrying clouds. There was light in\nthe sky--the twilight of the Long Day, for they were far beyond the\nArctic Circle.\n\nLooking down they could dimly see objects on the earth--trees, a house\nof some kind--several houses, in fact.\n\nAnd then suddenly there was added to their perils an unlooked-for\ndanger. Out of the murk which covered the earth below the flying machine\nsprang a point of light and the explosion of a gun echoed in the\naviators' ears.\n\nA rifle bullet tore right through to the inside and passed between the\nprofessor and Andy Sudds. There were men with firearms below, and they\nwere firing point blank at the flying machine.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nPHINEAS ROEBACH, OIL HUNTER\n\n\nAs has been said, the boys and their older companions had been in many\nperilous situations; but no adventure promised to end more tragically\nthan this flight of the huge airship. The descent of the _Snowbird_,\npunctuated by the rifle shot below, seemed likely to be fatal to them\nall.\n\n\"What kind of people can they be?\" gasped Mark. \"They are trying to\nshoot us.\"\n\n\"Give me my rifle! I'll show 'em!\" exclaimed the old hunter.\n\n\"You'll do nothing of the kind, Andy,\" commanded Professor Henderson.\n\"Do not make a bad matter worse by yielding to your passions.\"\n\nA second shot was fired by those upon the ground; but the bullet went\nwide of the mark. Jack shouted:\n\n\"We are drawing away from them. Look out! we all but hit that tree!\"\n\n\"Steady, Jack,\" admonished the professor. \"We'll be down in a minute,\nmy lads. Cling to anything handy. She will bounce some, but I believe\nwe shall not be injured.\" The calmness of the aged scientist would\nhave shamed the others into some semblance of order, were it needed;\nbut both the boys were courageous, Andy Sudds did not know fear, and\nif Washington White was in a panic of terror, he did not get in the\nway of the others to hamper their movements.\n\nThe _Snowbird_ was fluttering over the ground like a wounded bird,\nwhile so black were their surroundings that none of the party could\ndistinguish anything of nearby objects. The clouds had broken but\nlittle, and only for a moment.\n\n\"She's down!\" suddenly shouted Mark Sampson, and the flying machine\njounced on its rubber-tired wheels, and then struck the ground again\nalmost immediately.\n\nMark leaped down on one side and Andy Sudds on the other. Instantly,\nrelieved of their weight, the flying machine was carried on again and\nMark and Andy were thrown to the ground.\n\nPerhaps that was well, for several rifles were again fired behind them\nand they heard the bullets whistle above their heads.\n\n\"Low bridge, Mark!\" cried the old hunter, meaning for the boy to keep\nclose to the earth. \"I've got my gun.\"\n\n\"Don't fire on them, Andy,\" responded young Sampson, remembering the\nprofessor's warning. \"We don't know who they are or what they mean by\ntheir actions.\"\n\n\"We don't want to be shot down without making any fight; do we?\" cried\nAndy.\n\n\"Let us escape without a fight if possible,\" urged the cautious youth,\nfeeling sure that Professor Henderson would approve of this advice.\n\nBut the pounding of many feet approaching over the rising\nground--evidently, as Mr. Henderson had said, the foothills of the\nmountain range--warned Mark and the hunter to keep still. In the partial\nlight they saw a group of tall men, all armed, running past them in\nthe direction the wounded _Snowbird_ had been blown.\n\n\"Hush!\" whispered Andy. \"Indians!\"\n\nMark had seen their long hair and beardless faces, and believed the\nhunter was right. The enemy were dressed in clothing of skins and were\nwithout hats. Yet Mark knew that the Indians of Alaska were much\ndifferent from the savages of the western territories of the United\nStates. He did not believe these Alaskan aborigines would attack white\nmen.\n\nIt was growing lighter about them every moment. The lad and the tall\nhunter arose and stood listening for a further alarm--or for some cry\nfrom their comrades in the flying machine.\n\nAs the light increased they saw that they were in a grove of huge\ntrees. Somehow the _Snowbird_ had fluttered away through these forest\nmonarchs and was now out of sight.\n\n\"I wonder what's happened to them?\" gasped Mark.\n\n\"Them Indians haven't attacked yet,\" growled Andy Sudds. \"If they begin\nto shoot we'll know which way to go, and we'll foller them.\"\n\nBut the first sound they heard came from behind them. There was the\ncrash of heavy footsteps and a big man suddenly came panting up the\nslope. Cold as it was, his shirt was open at the neck, he was\nbare-headed, and he had not stopped to pull on his boots when he arose\nfrom his bed. In his right hand he carried a battered \"fish-horn,\" and\nwithout seeing Mark and Andy he stopped and put this instrument to his\nlips, blowing a blast that made his eyes bulge and his cheeks turn\npurple.\n\n\"Hold on, Mister!\" ejaculated the hunter. \"What you got to sell? Or\nbe you callin' the cows?\"\n\n\"Mercy on me!\" cried the fat man, and in a high, squeaky voice that\nseemed to be a misfit for his huge body. \"I am sure I'm glad to meet\nyou. You must have just arrived,\" and he squinted at the strangely\nclad hunter and his boy companion, for Mark wore a helmet with ear-tabs.\n\n\"We just landed, that's sure,\" admitted Andy. \"From an airship, I\nfancy,\" exclaimed the other. \"That is what is the matter with my Aleuts,\nthen. They never have seen such a thing as an airship, I'll be bound.\nHave they hurt any of your party?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Mark said, hastily. \"If you are in command of those\nIndians, call them off, please. There are three of our party somewhere\nwith the flying machine, and the Indians have been shooting at them.\"\n\n\"I'll try it,\" declared the man, instantly. \"I can usually call them\ntogether with this horn,\" and he raised it to his lips again and blew\nanother mighty blast.\n\n\"I have had this bunch of Aleuts six months,\" he explained, when he\ngot his breath again. \"They are good workers, but as superstitious as\nyou can imagine. They are particularly shaky just now, for a number\nof queer things have happened lately in these parts. There is a volcano\nsomewhere in action--we had a storm of ashes a week ago. And night\nbefore last there was a positive earth-shock.\"\n\n\"You seem like a pretty intelligent man,\" grunted Andy Sudds, in his\nblunt way. \"What are you doing up here in this heaven-forsaken country?\"\n\n\"Why, I am an oil hunter,\" said the fat man, simply. \"A _what_?\"\nrepeated Andy and Mark together.\n\n\"Oil hunter. My name is Phineas Roebach, and I am in the employ of the\nUniversal Oil Company. I am here--as I have been in many lands--boring\nfor petroleum. You understand that my mission is semi-secret. If we\nfind oil here we shall obtain a grant from the Government, or something\nlike that.\"\n\nJust at that moment Mark Sampson was not particularly interested in\nthe odd-looking Mr. Roebach or his business.\n\n\"Blow your horn again, sir,\" he begged. \"Call off your Indians. They\nmay shoot our friends.\"\n\n\"If your party is all dressed as peculiarly as yourself, young sir,\"\nsaid Phineas Roebach, \"my Aleuts could scarcely be blamed for taking\na pot shot at them.\"\n\nThen he blew the horn mightily for the third time.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nTHE EARTHQUAKE\n\n\nThe long twilight which preceded full day had now grown so strong as\nto reveal matters more plainly about the spot where Mark and Andy Sudds\nhad disembarked from the flying machine. They soon saw several objects\nrunning through the grove toward them, and these objects proved to be\nthe returning Indians.\n\nThere were half a dozen of them, and they were all armed with rifles.\nThe moment they beheld the old hunter and the youth, with Phineas\nRoebach, they gave every indication of shooting, for they stopped and\nraised their rifles, pointing them at Mark and Andy.\n\nMr. Roebach sprang between his Aleuts and his visitors and began to\nharangue them angrily in their own harsh dialect. However, his huge\nbody so entirely sheltered Mark and Andy that neither was much terrified\nby the Indians. Besides, the Maine hunter advanced his own rifle and\ncalculated he could do considerable execution with it while the red\nmen were hesitating.\n\n\"They believed you all spirits of the air,\" said the oil man, turning\nfinally to speak to his new friends. \"They were much frightened.\"\n\n\"Ask them for news of Professor Henderson and the others,\" begged the\nanxious Mark.\n\n\"They chased the crippled flying machine for some distance, but did\nnot find it. My horn bade them return,\" replied Mr. Roebach.\n\nEven as they started to walk with the oil man and his sullen Indians\ntoward various shacks which they saw through the trees, and lower on\nthe mountain side, they heard a hail and looked up to see Professor\nHenderson, Jack Darrow, and the negro, Washington White, descending\nthe mountain in their rear.\n\n\"This is your party; is it?\" demanded Mr. Roebach.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Mark.\n\n\"Bring them directly to my cabin. The Aleuts will not hurt you, now\nthat they know we are friends.\"\n\nHe hurried away, but Andy handled his rifle very suggestively and kept\nboth eyes on the red men. The latter, however, kept to themselves and\nonly stared at the crew of the _Snowbird_ with great curiosity.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" quoth Jack, when in earshot. \"Here they are, safe and sound,\nProfessor!\"\n\n\"We have been just as afraid that something bad was happening to you,\"\nMark said, quickly. \"Where's the machine?\" \"Your beautiful 'plane is\nbadly wrecked, Mark, my boy,\" said Professor Henderson. \"But I believe\nwe shall be able to repair it in time. We are not, however, I feel\nsure, far from Aleukan. Do those men speak English?\"\n\n\"Not much of it, I reckon, Professor,\" said Andy Sudds. \"But they have\ngot mighty nasty dispositions. If it wasn't for the fat man I reckon\nthey would jump on us.\"\n\n\"He told us to follow along to his cabin,\" Mark proposed. \"I do not\nthink these Indians will touch us.\"\n\n\"They'd better think twice about it,\" said the belligerent Andy, pushing\nin between the professor and the Aleuts, as the whole party descended\nthe mountain side toward the place where the oil man had pitched his\ncamp.\n\nAs they proceeded the light grew and the newcomers to Alaska identified\nobjects about them more clearly. Near at hand was the framework of a\nboring machine, or derrick. The professor began to notice a deposit\nof ash that lay thickly on the ground in sheltered places.\n\n\"How remarkable--how very remarkable!\" he ejaculated. \"One would think\nthere was a volcano in action very near here.\"\n\nMark repeated what Phineas Roebach had said about the 'quake and the\nstorm of ashes. The professor began to rub his hands together and his\neyes twinkled. \"I declare! I declare!\" he repeated. \"A seismic\ndisturbance in this locality? Ah! our visit to Alaska for Dr. Todd may\nrepay us nobly indeed.\"\n\nWashington White's eyes opened very wide and he demanded:\n\n\"What's disher t'ing yo' calls 'sezmik', Professor Henderson? I suah\ndon't understand no sech langwidge.\"\n\n\"He means an earthquake, Wash,\" said Jack, as the professor paid no\nattention to the darkey's question.\n\n\"Gollyation! is we goin' ter collek a _nearthquake_ along wid dat\nchrisomela-bypunktater plant? And what good's a nearthquake w'en you\ngot him?\"\n\nThis unanswerable question of the darkey's fell flat, for the party\njust then reached the huge, two-roomed log cabin in which Phineas\nRoebach made his headquarters. The \"oil hunter,\" as he called himself,\nappeared in a costume more fitted to the rigor of the weather.\n\n\"Come right in, gentlemen,\" was his cordial cry. \"I have an Indian\nwoman here who can cook almost as well as white folks. At any rate,\nshe can make coffee and fry bacon. This is Professor Henderson? Glad\nto meet you, sir,\" and so went on, being introduced to the whole party.\n\nThe professor immediately began to question the oil hunter regarding\nthe exact situation of his camp and learned that they were but a hundred\nand fifty miles from Aleukan. Phineas Roebach had a plentiful supply\nof dogs and sleds, too, with a goodly store of provisions. If worse\ncame to worst and the flying machine could not be at once prepared,\nMr. Roebach could supply the party with transportation to the Indian\nsettlement where Professor Henderson would meet his own supplies from\nColdfoot and there could obtain other dogs and sleds to go on to the\nvalley where the _Chrysothele-Byzantium_ was supposed to flourish.\n\n\"And the road from here to Aleukan is a good one at this season of the\nyear. More than half the way you travel over a glacier, and as the\nicefield has not been in motion for ages, it makes a fine highroad,\"\nthe oil hunter declared.\n\nThey were discussing these matters during breakfast, and everybody was\nfeeling particularly thankful over the safe descent of the aeroplane,\nwhen they were startled by a sudden, jarring shock. The cabin rocked\nand the boys, at least, felt a qualmishness in the pit of the stomach\nthat forbade further eating.\n\n\"What's that?\" demanded Andy Sudds.\n\nWashington White dropped the plate he was carrying to the table and\nran to the door. Before he could open it, the door was broken in by\nthe Indians, who came pouring in, loudly jabbering in their native\ntongue.\n\n\"A 'quake, sure enough!\" ejaculated Phineas Roebach, getting quickly on\nhis feet.\n\nAs he spoke, there was a repetition of the shock, only greatly\nincreased. The oil hunter was thrown to the floor, as was everybody\nelse in the house who was not seated. The roof of the cabin creaked\nand threatened to descend upon their heads.\n\nThe Indians, uttering cries of alarm, scrambled out of the cabin faster\nthan they came in. But they had nothing on Washington White _there_. He\nwas the first person to get through the door.\n\nThe white people followed the others in quick time. Jack and Mark felt\nthat if the cabin was going to fall, the open air was the safer place.\nHere, however, it seemed that they could not keep their feet. They\nreeled about like drunken men, and the forest trees bent and writhed\nas though an invisible wind tore at them, whereas the fact was that\nthe wind had fallen and it was a dead calm.\n\nThe air about them seemed to rock with the shock, there was a dull\nroaring sound which hummed continually in their ears, and the vibrations\nof the earth continued. They were indeed experiencing a most serious\nearthquake.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nTHE BLACK DAY\n\n\nThe 'quake was over in a very few moments; the Indians and Washington\nWhite, however, cowered upon the ground for some time, crying out their\nfear of what they considered supernatural phenomena. Jack Darrow and\nMark Sampson were not frightened in the same way as the darkey and the\nAleuts; nevertheless they were much shaken.\n\nProfessor Henderson, however, displayed naught but the keenest interest\nin the scientific side of the happening. He clambered to his feet the\nmoment he could stand, and observed:\n\n\"A most pronounced seismic disturbance--I should say earthquake.\"\n\n\"I should say it was pronounced!\" grunted Phineas Roebach. Being a fat\nman, he had fallen heavily. He was now rubbing himself tenderly where\nhe had been bruised upon the hard ground. \"This shock beats the one\nwe had the other day.\"\n\n\"Not a shock, my dear sir,\" said Professor Henderson, quickly. \"An\nearthquake is not, strictly speaking, a shock at all. Within the past\ntwenty years science has learned to measure and to study earthquakes.\nIf we have learned nothing else, we have learned that an earthquake\nis _not_ a shock.\"\n\n\"It tumbled us about a whole lot, then, Professor,\" said Jack Darrow.\n\"What would you call it, if not a shock?\"\n\nThe phenomena being over for the time--as all could see--they returned\nto the cabin to complete their meal. Roebach had said something soothing\nto his Indians, but they, like Washington White, preferred remaining\nin the open. Wash sat down beside the cage of his pet rooster, and\ndeclared to the boys when they urged him to come in again:\n\n\"No, sah! I ain't hongry, nohow. An' w'edder de professor am right dat\ndese yer earthquakes ain't shockin', I kin tell yo' right now dat it\nshocked _me_! Nor I ain't gwine ter gib it no secon' chance ter tumble\ndat ruff down on ma haid--no, sah!\"\n\nOnce more at the breakfast table, with the affrighted Indian squaw\nwaiting upon them, the professor took up the topic of earthquakes\nagain, in answer to Jack's observation.\n\n\"From the time of the ancients to the middle of the last century the\nphenomena of earthquakes were observed and described upon countless\noccasions,\" he said. \"Yet even Humboldt's 'Cosmos', published as late\nas 1844, which summarized the then existing knowledge on the subject,\ndid not suggest that earthquakes should be studied like other mechanical\nmotions.\n\n\"The effects of the great Neapolitan earthquake of 1857 were so studied\nby Mr. Robert Mallet,\" continued the professor. \"He disabused his mind\nof all superstition, threw away all the past mysteries, and attacked\nthe problem from its mechanical side only. He believed that an\nearthquake was a series of shocks, or blows; but what he learned led\nother and later students to the discovery that an earthquake is not\nmade up of blows at all.\"\n\n\"That's all very well to say,\" grumbled Mr. Roebach. \"I'm pretty solid\non my feet; but what was it but a shock that threw me down? Tell me\nthat, sir!\"\n\n\"Very easily explained,\" said the scientist, smiling. \"Which will the\nquicker take you off your feet--a blow from, say, Jack's fist, or your\nstepping inadvertently upon a piece of glare ice? The ice, because it\naffords you so insecure a footing, is likely to throw you easier than\na pretty solid blow; eh?\"\n\n\"True enough,\" admitted the oil hunter, smiling at Jack. \"Although\nDarrow looks to be a pretty husky youngster.\" \"My point is this,\"\npursued the professor. \"An earthquake is a continuous series of\nintricate twistings and oscillations in all possible directions, up\nand down, east and west, north and south, of the greatest irregularity\nboth in intensity and direction. This writhing of the earth--of the\nvery foundations of the ground we walk on--caused our recent overthrow,\"\nconcluded Mr. Henderson.\n\nBut the two boys were much more interested in the possibility of there\nbeing an active volcano in the neighborhood. The volcanic ash which\ncovered the leaves and grass like road-dust assured them all that some\nhuge \"blow-hole\" of the earth was near.\n\n\"I wasn't looking for no such things as volcanoes,\" said Andy Sudds,\nseriously, \"when I shipped for this voyage. I reckoned volcanoes blowed\nmostly in the tropics.\"\n\n\"Alaska is a mighty field of active volcanoes,\" declared Professor\nHenderson. \"But they have been mostly active on the Pacific coast, and\namong the islands which form a barrier between that ocean and Bering\nSea. Islands have been thrown up, while others have sunk there because\nof volcanic disturbances, within the last few years.\"\n\n\"And I presume the earthquake and the volcanic eruption are closely\nconnected?\" suggested Mark.\n\n\"We may safely believe that,\" agreed the professor. \"I am sorry my\ninstruments are not at hand. I sincerely hope none was damaged when\nthe _Snowbird_ made such a bad landing.\"\n\n\"And I'd like to give the machine an overhauling at once to see just\nhow badly she's damaged,\" Jack Darrow said, hastily. \"What do you say,\nMark?\"\n\n\"I'm with you,\" returned his chum. \"Can't we take Andy and Wash, Mr.\nHenderson, and go right up to that hollow and see what needs to be\ndone to the flying machine? Perhaps we can get off for Aleukan by\nto-morrow if we hustle.\"\n\n\"If you boys think you can repair the damage done the machine in so\nshort a time,\" agreed the professor, doubtfully. \"But you know we must\nat least arrive at Aleukan in time to meet the train from Coldfoot.\nIf the _Snowbird_ cannot be launched again, we will have to see\nif our good friend here, Mr. Roebach, can fit us out with dogs and\nmen.\"\n\n\"That I'll do to the best of my ability,\" said the oil man, rising.\n\"But I'd better get out now and set my men to work. I am boring in a\nnew place this week, and it looks promising. We are down a hundred and\ntwenty feet already.\" They put on their outer garments and left the\ncabin. Although this was summer weather, there was a sting of frost\nin the air even as it neared mid-forenoon. But the sun was strangely\novercast, and that might account for the drop in temperature.\n\n\"Disher day fo'git ter grow,\" complained Washington, rolling his eyes\nuntil, as Jack suggested, they could see only the whites of them in\nthe dark, and the gleam of his teeth. \"'Nstead o' bein' as sunshiny\nas it doughter be arter dat storm, it's suah growin' night fast! 'Taint\na full-grown day, nohow!\"\n\n\"Sort of stunted; is it, Wash?\" chuckled Jack.\n\nAndy Sudds here spoke decisively:\n\n\"I been tryin' to make out what it was, like feathers, a-touchin' my\nface. But it ain't snow. _It's ashes_!\"\n\n\"Volcanic dust!\" cried Mark.\n\n\"That volcano must be active again. That's what brought about the\nearthquake,\" said Jack. \"And the darkness. What we thought was a fog\nover the sun must be a cloud of ashes.\"\n\n\"This ain't no place for us,\" declared Andy. \"I wish we were back at\nthat man's house.\"\n\n\"Or could find the _Snowbird_ pretty soon,\" added Mark.\n\n\"We're going right for it--I'm sure of that,\" said Jack, cheerfully.\nAnd scarcely had he spoken when the four suddenly clung to each other,\nrocking on their feet! Washington White shrieked aloud, fell upon his\nknees, and it took but little to drag the boys and Andy Sudds with him.\n\n\"The whole world is done rockin' ergain!\" wailed the darkey. \"Dis is\nde end ob de finish!\"\n\nThe vibrations of the ground grew in strength. The air about them\nseemed to shake. The darkness was so intense that Jack, holding a\nshaking hand before his face, could not distinguish its outline. And\nall the time the volcanic ash drifted down through the writhing\ntree-tops, while the boys and their companions were unable to stand\nerect.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nTHE WONDERFUL LEAP\n\n\nUnlike the former trembling of the earth, this experience gave no\nimmediate promise of cessation. The world rocked on in awful throes--as\nthough it really was, as the black man feared, the end of all material\nthings. Jack and Mark rolled upon the ground in the grove of huge\ntrees, clinging to each other's hands, but unable to rise, or to find\ntheir two comrades.\n\nA rising thunder of sound accompanied this manifestation, too. And,\nafter some stricken minutes, the boys realized that it was thunder.\n\nWith the earthquake and the storm of volcanic ashes, came an electric\ndisturbance of the atmosphere, the like of which neither of the boys\nhad ever dreamed. They had felt the \"itch\" of the electric current\njust before the 'quake. Now the hair on their heads rose stiffly like\nthat on the back of an angry cat, and when Jack and Mark chanced to\nseparate for a moment, and each put out their hands to seize the other,\nthe darkness under the trees was vividly shot through for an instant\nwith the sparks which flew from their fingers.\n\nWashington White began to bawl terrifically at this display of\n\"fireworks,\" as he called it.\n\nHis lamentations were well nigh drowned by the rolling thunder. This\nlatter did not sound in ordinary explosions, or \"claps,\" but traveled\nin rapidly repeated echoes across the skies. The thick cloud of ashes\nwhich obscured the sun and the whole sky was cut through occasionally\nby a sword of lightning; but mostly the electricity showed itself in\na recurrent, throbbing glow upon the northern horizon, not unlike some\nmanifestations of the Aurora Borealis.\n\nBut even this uncertain--almost terrifying--light was of aid to the\nboys; Jack, at least, remembered very clearly the way to the wrecked\nflying machine, and of course the old hunter was not likely to lose\nhis way in as black a night as ever was made.\n\nThey struggled on between the intervals of pitch darkness, for the\ntrembling of the earth had again ceased. The visitation had been much\nheavier than they had previously suffered.\n\n\"The best thing we can do,\" muttered Mark in Jack's ear, \"is to fix\nup the _Snowbird_ and beat it away from here just as fast as we\ncan. This is altogether too strenuous a place for us, believe me!\" \"If\nwe only _can_!\" responded Jack, secretly as worried as his chum.\n\"This is a pretty fierce proposition, Mark. Just think of our bonny\n_Snowbird_ wrecked on her first voyage! It's mighty hard; eh, chum?\"\n\nBut the duty before the two boys just then was to find the wrecked\n'plane and see what could be done with it. The thunder continued to\nmutter and the intermittent flashes of electricity helped them somewhat\nin finding the way to the spot where the _Snowbird_ had made her\nfinal landing. But the fall of volcanic ash continued and the darkness,\nbetween the lightning flashes, remained as smothering as before.\n\nThey reached the spot, however--seemingly a small plateau on which the\nhuge trees did not encroach, giving them plenty of space for a flight\nif they were fortunate enough to get the _Snowbird_ in condition\nfor such an attempt.\n\nThere were both electric lamps and lanterns in the machine and Mark\nsent Washington White to light every one while he and Jack went over\nthe wrenched mechanism. Andy Sudds stood guard with his rifle, or ready\nto lend a hand should the boys need him.\n\nThe storm in the clutch of which the flying machine had traveled so\nmany hundred miles had wrenched her not a little. And the two landings\nshe had made on the mountainside had done her no particular good. There\nwas a broken plane, any number of wires to splice, and bent rods\ninnumerable.\n\nThese were the more apparent injuries. But the more delicate machinery\nof the _Snowbird_ required a thorough overhauling. It was absolutely\nnecessary for them to have the use of a forge, and Jack had already\nlearned that such an article was among the oil hunter's possessions at\nhis camp.\n\nThey were a solid three hours putting to rights the machine and\ncorrecting the damage done to her smaller parts. Then, with several\nrods to be straightened and the light framework of the broken plane,\nthat must be put in the fire for a bit, the party started down the\nmountain to Phineas Roebach's camp.\n\nThe four had left the plateau where the _Snowbird_ lay and were just\ndescending into the forest, carrying two storage battery lamps with\nwhich the easier to find their way.\n\nThere was no preliminary trembling of the earth or the air. There was\nan unheralded clap of sound--a sharp detonation that almost burst their\near-drums.\n\nThey did not fall to the ground; the earth, instead, seemed actually\nto rise and smite them!\n\nA cataract of sound followed, that completely overwhelmed them. They\nrealized that the huge trees were swaying and writhing as though a\nsudden storm-breath had blown upon them. Had a tornado swept through\nthis wood no greater danger could have menaced them. Trees about them\nwere uprooted; many bent to the earth; some snapped off short at the\nground--great boles two and three feet through!\n\nJack and Mark, with Andy Sudds and the terrified Wash, would have been\ndestroyed within the first few seconds of this awful upheaval had it\nnot been for a single fortunate circumstance. When the cataclysm was\ninaugurated the first shock drove the four into a sort of hollow walled\nabout with solid rock. Upon this hollow fell the first huge tree trunk\nof the flying forest--and it sheltered them instead of crushing them\nto death.\n\nThe four had but small appreciation of this--of either their temporary\nsafety, or the perils that menaced them. Suddenly the thick air seemed\nto stifle them. They could neither breathe nor see. The lamps had been\nlost when they were flung--like dice in a box--into the rock-sheltered\nhollow.\n\nAs the huge tree fell across their harbor of refuge, they all lost\nconsciousness.\n\nWhat happened during the next few minutes--perhaps it was a quarter\nof an hour--none of the little party of adventurers ever knew. It was\nJack who first aroused.\n\nThe whole world seemed still shrouded in pitch darkness. But he could\nbreathe without difficulty and he sprang to his feet with a peculiar\nfeeling of lightness as he did so.\n\nBut then he stumbled over Mark, and his chum came up, too, ejaculating:\n\n\"What is it, Jack? What is the matter now?\"\n\n\"You can search me!\" responded the other boy. \"If this sort of business\nkeeps on I shall wish, with Wash, that we'd never come to Alaska.\"\n\n\"You can wish it with me!\" grumbled Mark. \"Washington doesn't want to\nget back to Maine any more than I do right now, Jack.\"\n\n\"We must complete the repairing of the _Snowbird_,\" gasped Jack.\n\n\"And where are the rods--and the plane frame? And where are the lights?\"\n\nThey held on to each other in the darkness of this over-shadowed hollow\nand neither boy was willing to speak for a moment. Then Andy Sudds\nstaggered to them.\n\n\"I've lost my gun!\" he ejaculated, with a quaver in his voice that was\nquite surprising.\n\n\"And we've lost our lamps; but we'll find 'em, Andy,\" said Jack Darrow,\ncuriously enough becoming leader of the expedition right then, instead\nof the man. It wasn't that the old hunter was frightened; merely, he\ndid not know what to do in this emergency.\n\n\"Do you notice--?\" began Jack, seriously, and then stopped.\n\n\"Do I notice what, son?\" responded Andy.\n\n\"I don't see how you can notice anything without a light,\" interrupted\nMark querulously.\n\nThis statement seemed to arouse Jack's faculties completely. He did\nnot continue his remark, but said:\n\n\"That's our first job; isn't it?\"\n\n\"What's our first job?\" asked the hunter.\n\n\"To get a light. We can't find the flying machine, nor get back to\nRoebach's camp, without light. Why, it can't be more than mid-afternoon,\nyet it's as dark as a stack of black cats in a coal-chute.\"\n\n\"And that's where I feel as though I'd been,\" declared Mark.\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Fighting the cats in the coal-hole. Ouch! I'm lame and sore all over.\"\n\n\"We're sure up against it,\" repeated Andy. \"But there must be some way\nout, boys.\"\n\n\"Light is the first requisite,\" agreed Jack, more cheerfully. \"Got any\nmatches, Andy?\"\n\n\"Plenty of 'em in a corked flask. I don't ever travel without matches,\nson,\" returned the old hunter.\n\n\"But matches won't show us the way to Roebach's camp,\" complained Mark.\n\n\"Don't croak, old boy,\" advised Jack. \"Let's have that bottle of\ncosmolene I saw you tuck in your pocket there at the _Snowbird_.\"\n\n\"I was taking that to the professor. He said he would want it,\" said\nMark. \"What's it good for?\"\n\n\"You'll come pretty near seeing in a minute, Mark,\" returned the\nquick-thinking Jack. \"Here, Andy! let me have that woolen scarf you\nwear. You'll have to say good-bye to it--bid it a fond farewell.\"\n\n\"I'm sort of friendly to that scarf, youngster,\" said the hunter.\n\"What's to be done to it?\"\n\n\"It's going to become a lamp wick right here and now,\" declared young\nDarrow, promptly. \"So! I've got the cosmolene smeared on it already.\nThere! that's the last of it. Now a match, Andy.\"\n\n\"Joshua!\" grumbled the hunter. \"It _is_ good-bye, I guess!\" The match\nflared up. Jack touched it to the greasy woolen cloth. It began to burn\nbrightly and steadily at once.\n\n\"Now, you all hunt around for the things we dropped. If we can find\nthem we'll push out right away for the camp and the professor. You\nknow he'll be worried about us, just as we are worried about him!\"\n\nWith the light of the improvised torch flaring about them they saw\nwhat manner of place they were in. The huge trunk of the fallen tree\nhad not entirely shut them in the hole. Mark got in position to climb\nout beside the tree-trunk.\n\nThere was a small, tough root sticking out of the bank above his head.\nHe leaped to catch it with one hand, intending to scramble out by its\naid.\n\nAnd then the very queerest thing happened to him that could be imagined.\nThe spring he took shot him up through the hole like an arrow taking\nflight.\n\nHe never touched the root, but over-shot the mark and disappeared with\na loud scream of amazement and alarm into the outer world.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nTHE GEYSER\n\n\n\"Somebody grabbed him!\" shouted Andy Sudds.\n\n\"Oh, lawsy-massy-gollyation!\" yelped the frightened darkey. \"Massa\nMark done been kerried up, suah 'nuff! I tole youse disher was de end\nob de worl'.\"\n\nBut Jack, followed by the old hunter, sprang to the opening. How light\nthey were upon their feet! The experience of moving shot this surprising\nthought through Jack Darrow's mind:\n\n\"I'm as light as a feather. I have lost half my weight, I declare I\nHow can that be possible?\"\n\nAndy Sudds was evidently disturbed by the same thought. He cried:\n\n\"Somebody holt onto me! I'm going up!\"\n\nHe did actually bump his head upon the tree trunk above them. But the\nnext moment Jack scrambled through the opening, light and all, and\ncame out upon the open ground.\n\n\"I'm here, Jack! I'm here!\" cried Mark. \"But what's happened to me?\"\n\"Whatever it is, it has happened to us all,\" returned his chum. \"I\nseem to have overcome a good bit of the law of gravitation. Never felt\nso light in my heels in all my life before.\"\n\n\"What can it mean?\" whispered Mark in his chum's ear. \"It's magic!\"\n\n\"You've got me,\" admitted Jack. \"I'm not trying to explain it. But I\nknow that the air pressure on me isn't as great as it was. I feel like\nwe did when we were on the moon.\"\n\n\"Something awful has happened,\" suggested Mark, his tone still worried.\n\n\"We can be sure of that,\" Andy Sudds said. \"What shall we do?\"\n\n\"Find that stuff we were carrying and get back to the professor with\nit,\" said Jack, briefly. \"Here! I see the storage battery lamp--or,\none of them at least.\"\n\nMark at the same time stooped to pick up two of the lost rods. Jack\nfound the lamp to be in good order and gave it to Andy. The torch was\nrapidly becoming exhausted.\n\n\"Come, Washington,\" urged Jack, \"you hunt around, too. We must find\nthe parts of the airship we dropped. If we don't find them we'll\n_never_ get away from this place.\"\n\n\"And is we gotter go in de _Snowbird_, Massa Jack?\" queried the darkey.\n\"Has we jest _gotter_ go in dat flyin' contraption? Gollyation! dis\nchile hoped de walkin' would be good out oh Alaska. He an' Buttsy jest\nerbout made up deir minds dat dey wouldn't fly no mo'. Fac' is, I had\nsome idea ob clippin' Buttsy's wings so dat he couldn't fly no mo'!\"\n\n\"You can walk if you want to,\" said Mark, crossly; \"but I want to get\naway from this part of the country just as soon as ever I can. If the\nflying machine was ready I'd only wait long enough to get the professor\nand then we'd start.\"\n\n\"Guess we're with you there, Mark,\" agreed his chum, emphatically.\n\nMeanwhile they were all scrambling about for the parts of the machine\nthat had escaped them when the awful blast had knocked them into the\nhole and deprived them of consciousness. Fortunately none of the missing\nparts was very small and in twenty minutes of close scrutiny every\npiece was assembled. They did not find the second hand lamp, however.\n\n\"Now we must hurry back to the professor,\" Jack urged. \"I know he will\nbe dreadfully worried.\"\n\n\"Do you notice that it's getting lighter, boys?\" remarked Andy Sudds.\n\n\"I believe you!\" cried Mark. \"The ash has stopped falling, too.\"\n\n\"I know that the air is a whole lot clearer,\" rejoined his chum. \"And\nit's colder--or is it rare? Doesn't it seem like mountain air, Mark?\"\n\n\"We've been half-stifled for so long I reckon the change to purer air\nis what makes it seem so peculiar,\" returned his friend.\n\nYet Mark was puzzled--indeed they all were more or less disturbed by\nthe strange feeling that possessed them. Unless Washington White was\nan exception. The darkey went along blithely despite his expressed\ndistaste for their surroundings, and as they came to the lower end of\nthe grove of big trees, he began to run.\n\nIt had grown lighter all the time as they advanced. The cloud that had\nhidden the sun seemed to be rolled away like a scroll. The party could\nsee all about them. The ashes lay from two to eight inches deep on the\nground. Plants and shrubs were covered with the volcanic dust, and it\nwas shaken from the trees as they passed.\n\nWashington White bounded along like a rubber ball. He came to the\nplateau that overlooked the sheltered camp of the oil hunter. As the\ndarkness retreated across the valley, the derrick and the shanties\nbelonging to Phineas Roebach's outfit appeared.\n\nSuddenly several gunshots rang out in succession, and the sounds\nstartled the boys and Andy. Wild cries likewise arose from the valley.\nThe commotion was at the camp.\n\n\"The professor is in danger!\" cried Andy Sudds, and began to run.\n\nHis first leap carried him twenty feet; his second took him over a\nfallen tree-trunk six feet through.\n\n\"By Joshua!\" ejaculated the startled hunter. \"I've got springs in my\nshoes; ain't I?\"\n\n\"What can it mean, Jack?\" panted Mark, as the boys hurried on, side\nby side.\n\nJack Darrow had no answer to make. He was as amazed as his companions,\nand perhaps a little frightened as well.\n\nThey hurried after Andy and Wash; but the latter was far ahead. There\nwas a second volley of gunshots and at that moment Wash came to the\nverge of the steep descent to the camp.\n\nHe beheld some half dozen Indians--all swart, lank, fierce-looking\nbucks--just at the point of rushing the oil borer's hut.\n\nIt was no time for explanations, nor for hesitancy. Wash, like the\nothers behind him, believed that the Indians were making an attack\nupon their master, and the first thought of all was that Professor\nHenderson was with the oil man, and in peril.\n\n\"Gollyation! Git erway from dat dar door!\" bawled Washington. The black\nman was as timid as a fawn as a usual thing; but he was devoted to the\nold professor and he had that feeling of gratitude for Mr. Henderson\nthat overcame his natural cowardice. When the Indians, without giving\nhim a glance, rushed at the door, and a single shot from the half-opened\nwindow missed them by ten feet, Wash uttered another yell and sprang\nto reach the descending path.\n\nBut this strange lightness of body that had overtaken them all during\nthe past hour, played Wash a strange trick. Instead of landing a few\nfeet down the steep way, he cast himself fairly into the air, twenty\nfeet out from the hillside, and sailed down upon the startled Indians\nlike some huge black buzzard.\n\nThe red men glanced up over their shoulders and beheld the flying man.\nThe sight seemed to terrify them. With loud cries they started to run;\nbut two of them could not escape the flying black man.\n\nWash landed sprawling upon their shoulders bearing both Aleuts to the\nground. The door of the cabin was dashed open and Phineas Roebach ran\nout and seized the two red men before they could scramble up. The\nothers were streaking it for the woods as fast as they could travel.\n\n\"Gollyation!\" quoth Washington White. \"Has dem rapscallawags done\nharmed de ole perfesser?\"\n\n\"I am perfectly safe, Washington,\" said Professor Henderson, appearing\nat the door of the cabin. \"And here are the boys and Andy. I am relieved\nto see you all alive again--I really am.\"\n\n\"Ain't this been a gee-whizzer of a storm?\" queried the oil man, holding\nthe two Aleuts at arm's length.\n\nAlready the boys and Andy were tearing down the steep path. They\ntraveled like goats--as surefooted and as light upon their feet.\nProfessor Henderson watched their career in evident interest. Then,\ngingerly, trying the feat curiously, the old gentleman sprang for a\nsmall boulder beside the cabin. He leaped entirely over it.\n\n\"Light! Light as air!\" he murmured. \"This is a most puzzling\ncircumstance.\"\n\n\"Now, you fellows,\" growled Phineas, urging the two Indians along to\nthe boring machine. \"You'll get to work. I don't care if your friends\nhave run off and left you to do it all alone. I tell you we've near\nstruck oil. I know the signs.\" Then he gabbled at them a bit in their\nown language and the Aleuts took hold of the heavy bar by which the\nearth-auger was turned. \"They left the job--the whole of them--when\nthat last clap came,\" he explained to the boys.\n\nBut Jack and Mark were not much interested in the oil hunter's affairs.\nOnly Jack remarked that he thought the fat man had been foolish to arm\nthe Aleuts, or allow them to be armed. The Indians had evidently quite\ngone off their heads.\n\n\"They believe that we are spirits of the air,\" Professor Henderson\ntold his friends. \"That we are evil spirits. And I guess that Washington\nflying down upon them as he did will clinch that belief in their minds.\"\n\n\"Did you ever hear of anything like it before in all your days,\nProfessor?\" cried Jack. \"Why, we can all jump like deer. I never saw\nanything like it.\"\n\nBefore the professor could reply there came a shout from the direction\nof the oil man's derrick. The two Aleuts, with their driver, had been\nworking only a few moments at the auger. But perhaps the tool, so far\ndown in the earth, had been ready to bite into the gas-chamber. There\nwas a rumble from beneath that suggested to all that another 'quake\nwas at hand. Then the Indians and the fat man started away from the\nderrick on the run.\n\nThe auger and piping shot out of the hole like stones driven by a\ncatapult. Following the broken tools was a column of gas, gravel, water\nand mud that rose two hundred feet in the air. The earth trembled, and\nsquawking like frightened geese, the Aleuts took to the tall timber,\nfollowing the trail of their more fortunate comrades who had gotten\naway before. And they were not alone in their fright. The white men\nwere likewise amazed and troubled by the marvelous geyser. It was as\nthough the oil man had bored down to the regions infernal.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nNATURE GONE MAD\n\n\nThe fat man came panting to the group surrounding Professor Henderson,\njust as fast as he could move his feet. And never before had the boys,\nor the professor, or Andy, or the black man beheld such an apparently\nheavy man get over the ground at such speed.\n\n\"A very mysterious thing,\" the professor was saying again--and he did\nnot mean the roaring, spouting geyser that was shooting gas and debris\na couple of hundred feet into the air.\n\nNor did he have time then to explain what seemed so mysterious to him.\nThe descending debris threatened them all, and although they retired\nin a more dignified way than had the Indians from the vicinity of the\nspouting monster, they were all more or less disturbed by this new\nphenomenon.\n\nStones weighing from ten to twenty pounds were projected into the air,\nsome of them crashing through the roof of the cabin when they descended.\nThe mud and water grew into a pool, then a lake, completely surrounding\nthe spot where the derrick had stood and where the geyser continued\nto spout.\n\n\"We surely must move out,\" the oil man said, in much perturbation. \"My\nshop yonder seems to be a target for those rocks. There goes another!\"\n\n\"And we have got to use a forge to weld and straighten these damaged\nrods!\" Mark cried, worriedly.\n\n\"Sorry, boy. I don't believe any of us will be able to get at my forge\ntill this shower of missiles stops,\" said Phineas Roebach.\n\n\"What needs to be done to the flying machine?\" asked the professor,\nbriskly. \"Are you sure it can be repaired, Mark?\"\n\n\"Very sure, sir,\" replied the boy.\n\n\"And you, Jack?\" repeated Professor Henderson.\n\n\"We could fix it up all right before midnight,\" declared the other.\n\"But we must have a forge.\"\n\n\"This geyser will stop playing after a bit, we will hope,\" said the\nprofessor, encouragingly. \"If the flying machine is not past repair\nwe need not worry. Nor need you, Mr. Roebach. We can all get away from\nthis region if it becomes necessary.\"\n\n\"Ma goodness!\" gasped Washington White, who had listened to this speech\nwith his mouth ajar. \"Don't you consider, Perfesser, dat dere has\nerbout 'nuff happened yere fo' ter make it seem quite necessarious dat\nwe evacuate de premises sorter promscuous an' soon like? Why, I done\nwas sure de end ob He finish was at hand when dat las' big eart'quake\nhit us--I suah did!\"\n\n\"I must say I don't care to linger around here myself,\" muttered Andy.\n\n\"We must not lose our courage,\" said the professor. \"Never before have\nI been in a position to study seismic disturbances so closely. I only\nregret I have not with me here the instruments I brought in the\n_Snowbird_. And we must somehow learn the location of that volcano\nwhich is in eruption.\"\n\n\"It's all right to learn the location of it,\" whispered Mark to Jack.\n\"But if we learn that we'll be pretty sure to fly in the opposite\ndirection--what do you think?\"\n\n\"Believe me,\" said Jack, \"I've got enough. The old professor is all\nright, but he doesn't think about danger when his interest in any\nnatural phenomena is aroused.\"\n\nThe roaring of the geyser was a most unpleasant sound and the upheaval\nof the stones was more than unpleasant--it threatened danger to them.\nThe vicinity of the oil-boring had been exceptionally free from small\nstones; but in half an hour one might have picked up a two-horse\ncartload weighing from ten to twenty pounds each.\n\nWashington had run in and saved Buttsy in his cage, and they had all\nretired now to the little plateau from the verge of which Washington\nhad made his famous leap to the backs of the two Indians. Phineas\nRoebach had released the dogs from the shed where they had been\nconfined. There were twenty of the animals--three or four teams--fierce\nand intractable brutes as a usual thing, unless under the sharp control\nof their Indian drivers. But now they came whining and crouching to\nthe feet of the human beings grouped together on the plateau.\n\nThe evening was growing clear; but the geyser continued to roar like\nthe exhaust of some mighty engine and to throw off filth and\nevil-smelling gas. Professor Henderson stood there, wrapped in his\nfurs, and penciled notes in his book with a grave enjoyment of the\nscene that made his companions wonder.\n\nBut Andy Sudds read signs other than those of which the professor made\nnotes. Jack saw the old hunter watching the sledge dogs with a puzzled\nfrown wrinkling his brow.\n\n\"What's the matter with you, Andy?\" queried the youth.\n\n\"Them dogs,\" declaimed the hunter.\n\n\"What about them?\" \"They're plumb scart. All this disturbance and\nmystery has got in on them. They act just like they were seeing spooks.\"\n\n\"Spooks!\" repeated Jack in surprise. \"Do you mean to say dogs can see\nghosts?\"\n\n\"All dogs can smell out when things is going to happen,\" declared Andy\nSudds. \"They're better prophets than old women, you bet you! And these\ndogs act to me as though we hadn't come by the worst of our trouble\nyet.\"\n\nOddly enough it was Professor Henderson himself who took up the\nsuggestion that more trouble was in the offing.\n\n\"It is my opinion, Mr. Roebach,\" he said, to the oil man, \"that you\nhad better remove such possessions as you can from this valley at once.\nAnd put your dogs somewhere so that they cannot run away like your\nIndians. If we are balked in attempting to repair the flying machine,\nthese dogs and sleds are what we must depend upon.\"\n\n\"To escape from this country, you mean, sir?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"To reach Aleukan and the valley where the _Chrysothele-Byzantium_ is to\nbe found,\" replied the professor, promptly.\n\nBut it was to run the chance of a rain of death to go down into the\nbasin where the shop and cabin were situated. Further up the hillside\nthe dogs' quarters had been built, and the sleds were there, too. The\noil man and Andy Sudds looked at one another.\n\n\"All the stores are in the far end of the cabin,\" grunted Roebach.\n\"And you can see what that geyser is doing to the shed where the tools\nare. There goes another stone through the roof!\"\n\n\"If we could only get hold of that portable forge,\" said Mark.\n\n\"And that is what we _must_ get,\" exclaimed Jack. \"Is the door of that\nshanty locked, Mr. Roebach?\"\n\n\"It's nothing but a skin door,\" replied the oil man. \"But it's at the\nfar side--fronting that old mud-slinger. Did you ever see the beat of\nthat? _That_ stone must have weighed fifty pounds.\"\n\nBut Jack Darrow noticed a certain fact. That was that the debris from\nthe spouter was not shot so high as at first. Therefore, it was not\nbeing spread abroad so far.\n\nOnly small stones, now, were dropping around the tool shed. And the\nrear wall of the shanty was made of the most flimsy material.\n\nSuddenly he slipped down to one side and got upon the level of the\nvalley. Nobody but Mark noticed his movements for a minute, and to him\nJack had given a warning glance.\n\nThe boy had crossed to the back of the tool-shed before the men of the\nparty noticed his absence from the knoll.\n\n\"Look at that reckless fellow!\" ejaculated the professor. \"Come back\nhere, Jack!\"\n\nBut Master Jack was already at the shed. He tore away a part of the\nrear wall in a moment. The mud rained down upon him, but fortunately\nno rock came his way.\n\nThere was light enough yet for him to see inside the hut. Andy Sudds\nhad already started after Jack, and when the latter dragged the small\nforge out of the shelter, the old hunter picked it up, flung it upon\nhis shoulder, and trotted back to the highland.\n\n\"Come away! Come away, Jack!\" cried the professor again.\n\nBut the youth stopped long enough to obtain a sledge hammer and other\ntools that he knew they should need. As he ran from the hut two stones\nshot out by the geyser crashed through the roof; but he escaped all\ninjury.\n\nHe was plastered with mud from head to foot, however, when he regained\nthe high land.\n\n\"It was worth it,\" Jack declared, laughing, when he was safe. \"I want\nto get away from this neighborhood just as quick as we can. And if\nwe can fix the _Snowbird_ let us do it this very night and take our\nflight for other climes. We don't know when another earthquake or\nvolcanic eruption will occur.\"\n\n\"Very true, my boy,\" admitted the professor, with a sigh. \"At least,\nwe will endeavor to repair the damage done to your flying machine at\nonce. But there is much going on here that interests me.\"\n\nAndy and Jack set up the forge and in a few minutes they had a glowing\nfire in it. Then the boys set to work welding the broken rods and\nstraightening those that had become bent.\n\nMeanwhile Mr. Roebach hauled out his sled and whipped the dogs into\nline so that he could gear them up. The canines acted badly because\nthey were more used to their Indian masters. When the boys had done\ntheir work, however, the oil man was ready to transport them all up\nthe mountainside to the plateau where the _Snowbird_ lay.\n\nHis cabin was by this time riddled by the flying stones and everything\nin and about it was plastered with mud. It would have been foolhardy\nindeed to attempt to get at the provisions.\n\n\"You see,\" Mark said, \"we are forced to get away in the _Snowbird_\nat once, or to escape to some town where we can get food. There isn't\nmuch left of our stores on the flying machine.\" \"And what will Mr.\nRoebach do about his dogs? They must be fed,\" said Jack.\n\n\"He'll have to abandon them if he goes with us on the _Snowbird_,\"\nreturned his chum.\n\nIt was now the long twilight of the Arctic evening. None of the party\nhad eaten since breakfast and they felt the need of sustenance. If\nnothing else, this need of food would have hurried the party on to\ntheir destination farther up the mountainside.\n\nAs they advanced the roaring of the mud geyser diminished. The professor\ncontinued to be much interested in the condition of Nature about them\nas they climbed the hill. The uprooted trees, and the huge trunks\nbroken off by the final upheaval of the earth, made the old gentleman\nlook very serious indeed.\n\n\"There has been a mighty change in the face of Nature,\" he said\nthoughtfully. \"You boys were saved from death by a miracle, I have no\ndoubt.\"\n\n\"We were all knocked senseless for a time,\" Mark told him.\n\n\"Indeed? And so were we at the camp. All of us lost consciousness.\nDear, dear! what happened during those minutes that we were all\nunconscious? Something of the greatest importance--some great change\ntook place that now we can scarcely understand.\" \"And what do you make\nof that over yonder?\" queried Jack, suddenly pointing toward the\nnorthern horizon.\n\nA deepening glow had appeared in that direction. Rapidly it increased\nuntil there appeared above the horizon the edge of a huge disk. Its\nlight was mellow like the moon's; but whoever heard of the moon rising\nin the North?\n\n\"What can that possibly be, Professor?\" cried Mark as they all gazed\nin wonder at the rapidly increasing body rising into complete view.\n\nProfessor Henderson shook his head slowly. For once he was surely at\na loss to explain a scientific phenomenon. The huge globe, evidently\nreflecting palely the sun's light, mounted upward more rapidly than\nthe moon ever crossed the heavens.\n\n\"All nature has gone mad!\" gasped Professor Henderson at length. \"Have\nwe discovered a new celestial body? I never heard of such a thing--so\nnear to us, too! Come, hurry on, boys. Let me get and mount the\ntelescope. This new mystery must be solved.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nON THE WING AGAIN\n\n\nThere was no member of the party who was not amazed and disturbed by\nthe strange happenings of the last few hours. The earthquake and\nvolcanic disturbances, followed by the outburst of the geyser, and now\ncapped by the appearance of a new and wondrous planet on the northern\nhorizon, were happenings calculated to make more than Washington White\nshake with terror.\n\nWhat Professor Amos Henderson really thought about this new celestial\nbody it would be hard to tell. While the others chattered in their\namazement--after his first statement--he remained strangely quiet.\n\nBut the moment the party reached the spot where the flying machine\nrested he went at once to the locker where he had stowed the very\npowerful telescope that he had insisted upon bringing with them from\nhome. With Washington's help he was an hour in setting up the telescope\nand properly adjusting it, while the boys and Andy worked steadily\nupon the repairing of the flying machine. Roebach had loosed his dogs\nagain and threw them the last bits of fish he had for them, and they\nwere fighting over the putrid flesh at one side. The oil man watched\nthe repairs with interest. He had agreed to travel as far as Aleukan\nwith the party and there hire fresh Indians and sleds, hoping to find\nthese dogs on his return. He had to have assistants and provisions\nbefore he could go on with his work for the Universal Oil Company.\n\n\"Merely that yonder oil-shoot turned into a mud-bath doesn't feaze\nhim,\" chuckled Jack to Mark. \"Earthquakes and volcanoes don't seem to\nbother that chap any more than they do the professor.\"\n\n\"Just watch him now,\" suggested Mark, suddenly.\n\n\"Watch who--Roebach?\"\n\n\"The professor,\" explained Mark.\n\nThe old gentleman was certainly deeply interested at that moment in\nhis study of the great pale globe that was rising toward the zenith\nso much more quickly than any moon that the boys had previously seen.\nThe professor was crouched at the mirror of the telescope gazing into\nit through the powerful lens. Suddenly he threw up his hands and\nstaggered back from the instrument, turning a pallid face upon his\ncompanions. \"What done happened yo', Perfesser?\" cried Washington\nWhite. \"What done skeer yo' now? Dis suah am de startlin'est place dat\nwe ebber got into. Gollyation! Ain't dat moon risin', dough?\"\n\n\"It is no moon!\" declared the professor.\n\n\"A most mysterious thing,\" Mark said. \"Is it some great planet out of\nits orbit, sir?\"\n\n\"It is a planet--of course it is a planet,\" admitted the professor,\ngoing back to his telescope with eagerness.\n\n\"And how light it is getting--almost like day,\" said Jack. \"No moonlight\nwas ever like this.\"\n\n\"Why, we're not as far away from that planet as the moon is from the\nearth,\" said Mark. \"Suppose it bumps us?\"\n\n\"All the more reason for our getting the _Snowbird_ into flying\nshape,\" responded Jack. \"Maybe we'll be able to escape the bump!\"\n\n\"You can laugh,\" grumbled Mark. \"But I don't like the look of that\nthing.\"\n\n\"Evidently the professor does not like it, either,\" agreed Jack. \"See\nhim now.\"\n\nProfessor Henderson was gazing first into the telescope and then drawing\nupon a paper before him. For several minutes he was thus engaged.\nFinally he beckoned the boys to him.\n\n\"What do your eyes tell you that looks like?\" he demanded of Jack and\nMark, pointing to the outline he had drawn upon the paper.\n\nThe boys gazed on his drawing in surprise. It was Jack who exclaimed:\n\n\"Why, Professor, that looks a whole lot like an outline map of the\nHudson Bay Territory, Canada, and Newfoundland. There's the mouth of\nthe St. Lawrence, sure! What are you doing?\"\n\n\"I have been drawing,\" said the gentleman, solemnly, \"an outline of\nwhat I see upon that luminous body floating there in space,\" and he\npointed a trembling finger at the strange planet.\n\n\"Impossible!\" cried Mark.\n\n\"I do not think I am losing my mind,\" said the professor, testily. \"It\nremains, however, that the outline of certain bodies of water and of\nland upon that luminous globe seem to be the exact counterpart of\nland-bodies and water-bodies on the Earth.\"\n\n\"But what does it mean?\" questioned Jack.\n\n\"If I knew that,\" grumbled the professor, returning to his instrument,\n\"I should feel better satisfied.\"\n\nThat some strange--some really wonderful--change had taken place in\ntheir physical surroundings, too, there could be no doubt. But what\nit was the boys could not imagine. Of one thing they were sure, however:\nThe law of gravitation had been partly overcome. And a second fact was\ndiscernible: There was a surprising rarity to the air they breathed,\nand had been since the fall of volcanic ashes had ceased.\n\nIn lifting the heavier tools they handled it was noticeable that they\nseemed lighter. And Andy Sudds surprised them all, when it became\nnecessary to roll a log out of the way of the flying machine, by seizing\nthe heavy timber and lifting it with the ease with which one might\nlift a small sapling.\n\n\"We've all become strong men--professional strong men,\" gasped Jack.\n\"Wash is the champion jumper and Andy beats old Samson, I declare!\nWhat do you make of it, Mark?\"\n\n\"If the professor cannot explain it, don't expect me to do so,\" returned\nhis chum.\n\n\"It am de seriousest question dat has ebber come befo' us,\" declared\nWashington, looking wondrous wise. \"Disher jumpin' has always been in\nma fambly, howebber. We had some great jumpers down Souf befo' de War.\"\n\nThe boys hurried to finish the repairs. It was some time after midnight\nwhen they pronounced the _Snowbird_ again ready for flight.\n\nThe professor had to be urged more than once to leave his telescope,\nhowever; and then he insisted upon setting it up on the deck of the\nflying machine. He would not discuss the situation at all; but his\nserious visage and his anxious manner betrayed to them all that he\nwas disturbed indeed by the strange, pale planet he had so closely\nexamined.\n\nMr. Roebach turned loose his dogs again and climbed gingerly aboard\nthe flying machine.\n\n\"I've never been up in the air,\" he said, \"and I must admit that I am\nsomewhat more afraid of a flying machine than I am of an earthquake.\"\n\n\"No more earthquakes in mine, thank you!\" cried Jack. \"I'd rather sail\non a kite than go through what we did yesterday.\"\n\nThey had studied the chart and laid the course for Aleukan without any\ndifficulty. Now Jack strapped himself into the operator's seat and the\nothers took their places, Washington White stowing his rooster carefully\namidships as he had before.\n\nJack started the motor and the _Snowbird_ began to quiver throughout her\nframe. He touched the lever by which the propellers were started. With a\nwhir and a bound the flying machine left the earth.\n\nNever had it sprung into the air so quickly before. It shot up at a\nsharp incline and was over the tree-tops in a breath. The indicator\nregistered eighty miles an hour before the plateau was behind them.\nThen the pointer whirled to ninety--to a hundred--to a hundred fifteen\nmiles an hour, and both Jack, in the pilot's seat, and the others\ngasped for breath.\n\nFaster than when shot out of Professor Henderson's catapult the\n_Snowbird_ winged her way into the northwest. Jack managed to keep her\non an even keel. But he had the same feeling that he would have had, had\nhe been hanging to the bit of a runaway horse.\n\nIndeed, the _Snowbird_ was practically out of his control.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nA PLUNGE TO THE ICE\n\n\nJack Darrow was a youth less likely to be panic-stricken than his chum;\nbut just as Mark Sampson had lost his head for a few minutes on the\noccasion when the _Snowbird_ was tried out, so Jack was flustered now.\n\nThe flying machine shot up at such a tangent, and so swiftly, that he\nwas both amazed and frightened. The speed indicator showed a terrific\npace within a few seconds, and when Jack first tried to reduce the\nspeed he learned that the mechanism acted in a manner entirely different\nthan ever before.\n\nThe motor made more revolutions a minute than she was supposed to make\nwhen pressed to the very highest speed. When he had raised the bow of\nthe flying machine at the start she had shot up almost perpendicularly\ninto the air. He was afraid she was going to turn a back somersault.\n\nAs he depressed the planes he found that it took much more depression\nto bring the _Snowbird_ down to even keel. And the rapidity with\nwhich they left the ground and soared upward was in itself enough to\nshake Jack's coolness. Suddenly (being furnished with the professor's\npatented ear-tabs) he heard that gentleman calling to him from below:\n\n\"Get back to the five-hundred-foot level--quick!\"\n\nLight as his head had become, and confused as he was, Jack realized\nwhat these words meant, and he knew enough to obey without question.\nHe brought the _Snowbird_ down the air-ways on a long slant and\nat a swift pace. He realized that, as they descended, he was able to\nbreathe more easily and his head stopped ringing. For some moments he\nhad felt like an intoxicated person in the vastly rarified plane of\nthe upper ether.\n\nThe professor staggered to the young operator's side.\n\n\"Danger! Danger above, boy!\" he gasped. \"We cannot cross these mountains\nwhile--while the air is so thin.\"\n\n\"But we need not cross them to reach Aleukan?\" suggested Jack, speaking\nwith some difficulty himself. There was a pain in the region of his\nlungs and he saw that Professor Henderson was very pale.\n\n\"That is a fact,\" panted the professor. \"Descend, Jack. Make it two\nhundred feet. Be careful!\"\n\nFor as the youth depressed the planes again the ground beneath seemed\nto fairly leap up to meet them.\n\n\"What do you know about that?\" gasped the young aviator. \"She--she\ndoesn't work at all like she used to.\"\n\n\"Less attraction,\" declared the scientist.\n\n\"What do you mean, sir?\" cried Jack. \"Has the law of gravitation lost\nits power over us--and over the flying machine?\"\n\n\"There is a difference--a great difference,\" proclaimed Professor\nHenderson. \"The power of attraction is lessened mightily.\"\n\n\"What does it mean? What _can_ it mean?\" murmured the disturbed youth.\n\n\"I suspect--I fear--\"\n\nWhat the professor would have said was not spoken then. Mark interrupted\nby shouting:\n\n\"Look ahead! Look ahead! What is that--a river?\"\n\n\"There is no river of size in this locality,\" declared the professor,\nquickly, training his glasses on the white streak that appeared on the\nground ahead.\n\nPhineas Roebach struggled forward to the operator's bench. He gasped:\n\n\"This is worse than I ever thought flying could be. Do you have to go\nso fast? I cannot get my breath. Hullo! That's the glacier ahead. The\ndog trail to Aleukan follows the ice for more than fifty miles.\"\n\n\"A glacier it is,\" agreed Professor Henderson. \"It seems pretty smooth,\nJack. You can descend still farther.\"\n\nThat they were all suffering from the rarity of the atmosphere was\nplain. It seemed as though the envelope of breathable air surrounding\nthe earth had suddenly become vastly rarified. If the atmosphere had\nbeen so changed all over the globe it would be a catastrophe\nunspeakable.\n\n\"We certainly _can't_ cross these mountains--nor the Rockies,\" groaned\nJack. \"How are we ever going to get home again?\"\n\n\"If the air remains as it is now?\" asked Mark. \"You're right! We're\nimprisoned in this part of Alaska just as fast as though we were caged\nbehind iron bars.\"\n\n\"If we only had some of those torches we used on the moon,\" said Jack.\n\n\"What will we do, Professor?\" begged Mark.\n\n\"Let us not lose hope,\" responded the old scientist. \"First we will\nget to Aleukan and see if our provisions have been brought over from\nColdfoot.\"\n\n\"I'll bet they haven't been brought across the range,\" said the\npessimistic Mark. \"If the air everywhere is so rarified the men would\ndie crossing the mountains.\" \"Think of the people living on Mt.\nWashington--and other heights!\" cried Jack, suddenly. \"Why, they will\nbe snuffed out like candles. It is an awful thought.\"\n\n\"We will hope, at least, that this fearful catastrophe is local,\" said\nthe professor, seriously. \"Have a care, Jack! Don't dip like that. We\ndo not want to descend here.\"\n\nIt was extremely difficult to manage the _Snowbird_, for she answered to\nthe levers so much more quickly than before. The air pressure on the\ncraft was so slight that at the least touch she mounted upward like a\nscared quail! The speed of the aeroplane had to be reduced, too; they\ntraveled scarcely forty miles an hour.\n\nOn either hand as they winged their way over the great river of ice\n(it was quite four miles broad) sharp cliffs arose, guarding the\nglacier. These cliffs ranged from two hundred to a thousand feet high.\n\nThe professor, at once interested in such a marvel of nature, begged\nJack to reduce the speed even more. They merely floated above the\ncracked expanse of whitish-green ice for some minutes.\n\n\"That's what the earthquakes did for it,\" said Phineas Roebach. \"You\nsee those crevasses--and some of 'em mighty deep? Well, they weren't\nhere the last time I came this way.\" \"She is in motion again, perhaps,\"\nsuggested Professor Henderson.\n\n\"It ain't been in motion for ages--or, so the Aleuts say,\" responded\nthe oil hunter.\n\n\"But there looks now to be some sagging forward. There is a crevasse\nsplitting the glacier from wall to wall,\" proclaimed the scientist.\n\n\"We'd never be able to sled over this trail in the world!\" cried Mark.\n\"How would you pass such a yawning gulf as that?\"\n\n\"It beats me what's happened here since I was across last,\" muttered\nRoebach, scratching his head in bewilderment.\n\nThe yawning ice was right beneath the flying machine. It was a hundred\nyards across at the surface. They seemed to be looking down for five\nhundred feet, or more, into its greenish depths.\n\nJack had turned the _Snowbird's_ prow and they were drifting toward the\nwestern cliffs which guarded the glacier. Here the rocky heights were at\nleast seven hundred feet above the ice.\n\nOut of a crack in the high wall--from its eyrie without doubt--a huge\nfemale eagle suddenly shot down toward the drifting aeroplane. The\nflying machine seemed not to startle the great bird at all; it only\nangered her. Perhaps she had young up there in the cliff and she feared\nher hereditary enemy, Man, was coming on wings to deprive her of them.\n\nWith a scream of rage the eagle dashed herself directly into the face\nof Jack, strapped to the operator's seat. For once Andy Sudds had not\nhis rifle at hand; and, the attack was so unexpected, it is doubtful\nif he could have come to the rescue in season.\n\nWith beak and claws the bird endeavored to tear at the youth's face.\nJack jerked loose the transmitter and beat it to pieces over the bird,\nbut without making her desist.\n\nAgain and again the feathered creature darted in, claws expanded and\nbeak snapping. With one talon she raked Jack's right arm and shredded\nthe heavy coatsleeve, the sleeve beneath, and scratched his arm. The\nnext instant her iron beak snapped upon his left hand.\n\nJack Darrow was plucky, but the pain of the wound brought a scream to\nhis lips. It was answered by the wild shrieks of the eagle.\n\nAnd then, ere any of his friends could reach him (for the professor\nhad gone back to the cabin), the boy, fighting for his sight--indeed,\nfor his very life--by some unfortunate movement depressed the planes.\nLike an arrow from the bow the _Snowbird_ shot downward into the yawning\ncrevasse which split the glacier from wall to wall. With a yell of\nterror Mark Sampson sprang forward to the operator's bench. But he was\ntoo late--if he could have done any good at all.\n\nThe _Snowbird_ swung to one side. Her right forward plane crashed\nagainst the wall of ice, shattering some of the hard crystal. But on\nthe rebound the fluttering flying machine sank lower. Jack tried to\nmake her rise. She refused to obey the lever.\n\nAnd then, with a suddenness that made them all catch their breath, the\n_Snowbird_ plunged down into the ice-gulf and ended her dive with\na terrific crash on a narrow shelf at least two hundred feet below the\nsurface of the glacier.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nPROFESSOR HENDERSON REVEALS THE TRUTH\n\n\nThe force with which the flying machine had plunged into the chasm in\nthe ice was sufficient to smash her keel-fin to bits. There was other\ndamage done, too--how great this damage was the boys and the professor\ncould not immediately discover.\n\nThey were all alive--that was one thing to be thankful for. And\nWashington White's Shanghai, aroused from sleep by the disturbance,\nbegan to crow vociferously.\n\nThe _Snowbird_ was wedged into a very small space upon the ledge\nof ice. At first view it was quite certain that she could not be\nlaunched again from this position by any ordinary means. And the\nsteering gear was practically a wreck, so that she positively must be\nrepaired before attempting another flight.\n\nJack's wounds were dressed by Andy first of all. Mark and the professor\nmade some attempt to look over the wreckage. The disaster was so great\nthat Mark gave up hope.\n\n\"We're done for now!\" he cried. \"The poor _Snowbird_ is a wreck. And how\nare we ever going to get out of this hole?\"\n\n\"Hush, my boy!\" admonished the professor. \"Don't lose your grip. This\nis truly a serious predicament; but we have been in tight places\nbefore.\"\n\n\"Nothing worse than this,\" grumbled Mark. \"Nor half so bad. How are\nwe going to get out of this chasm? Why, just as Washington says, we've\nbeen swallowed up like a duck gobbling a June bug.\"\n\n\"This is certainly a bad situation,\" Phineas Roebach remarked. \"But,\nas the professor says, it isn't the worst that might happen.\"\n\n\"What worse could happen?\" demanded Mark.\n\n\"Hold on! Don't you step too near the edge of this shelf,\" warned the\noil man. \"If you step off and fall clear to the bottom of this crevasse\nyou'll probably find _that_ a good deal worse than our present position.\nB-r-r! Isn't it cold?\"\n\nTwo hundred feet below the surface of the ice river was indeed a cold\nspot. Washington produced all the warm clothing there was aboard the\nflying machine and all hands were glad to bundle up. Then the professor\nsuggested that the black man prepare some hot drink and a ration of\ntheir food, while all gathered in the cabin for a discussion as to\ntheir future course. \"Our perilous situation is apparent,\" said\nProfessor Henderson, quietly. \"But there is always more than one way\nout of a serious predicament--sometimes there are a dozen ways.\"\n\n\"I'd like to hear of a dozen ways of getting out of this hole,\" murmured\nMark Sampson.\n\n\"Mr. Roebach,\" said the professor, ignoring the youth, \"what do you\nsay? What is your advice?\"\n\n\"The sun will be up in an hour, or thereabout. It's pretty dim down\nhere. Let us wait and see what daylight shows us,\" was the oil man's\nreply.\n\n\"The moon--the _other_ moon--is just appearing,\" Jack said. \"We'll\nhave light enough in a few minutes.\"\n\n\"Two moons! what do you think of that?\" cried Mark.\n\n\"Are you sure, Jack?\" queried the professor, eagerly.\n\n\"I just saw it peeking over the eastern cliffs while Andy was patching\nme up.\" He carried one arm in a sling, and his other hand was bandaged.\n\n\"Then I must take an observation,\" ejaculated the professor, and seizing\nsome instruments he had arranged on the table he went out to where the\npowerful telescope was adjusted.\n\n\"He's forgotten all about gittin' out of this hole in the ice,\" said\nAndy. \"I, for one, think we'd ought to take axes and begin to cut steps\nup the wall. How else will we escape from the place?\"\n\n\"The poor old _Snowbird_ cannot be repaired in a hurry, that is sure,\"\nmuttered Mark.\n\n\"And this is no place to remain for fun,\" agreed Jack. \"Suppose the\nwalls of the crack should shut together--where would we be?\"\n\n\"Just about here, for fair!\" said Phineas Roebach, grimly, while\nWashington uttered a most mournful wail.\n\n\"Gollyation! Is we gotter be squeeged ter deaf in disher awful\ncavernarious hole? Dis is suah a time ob trouble an' tribbilation.\"\n\nThey heard an exclamation from the professor and Jack led the way to\nthe open deck of the crippled flying machine. By chance the _Snowbird_\nin landing had remained upright, her decks on a level. They found the\nprofessor bending over some further calculations on a great sheet of\npaper. Here, two hundred feet below the surface of the ice, the heavenly\nbodies all looked brighter and more distinct than they had while the\naeroplane was in flight above the ground.\n\nThe strange new planet had not yet gone out of sight. From the east\nthe old moon was soaring steadily. There could be no mistaking the two\norbs, now that both were visible in the sky at once. The new planet\nor moon was much larger than the real moon.\n\n\"What do you suppose that great planet is?\" queried Jack.\n\nThe professor looked up from his calculations. His face was very pale;\nhis eyes glowed with excitement. The boys had seldom seen the old\ngentleman so moved.\n\n\"You are right, my boy. A planet it surely is,\" he said to Jack.\n\n\"But why have we never seen it before?\" demanded Mark.\n\n\"For a very good reason,\" returned the professor, solemnly. \"We were\nnever in a position before to behold that planet, save on two\noccasions.\"\n\n\"Then we have seen it twice before?\" asked the puzzled Jack.\n\n\"On two occasions we have been enabled to stand off, as it were, and\nlook at that planet as though we were inhabitants of another world--when\nwe went to the moon, and when we went to Mars.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Professor?\" cried Mark.\n\n\"It's the earth!\" exclaimed Jack Darrow. \"It's the earth! We have left\nthe earth--is that it, Professor?\"\n\nThe old scientist nodded. Phineas Roebach snorted his disbelief, while\nWashington White gave vent to his trouble of mind most\ncharacteristically:\n\n\"Goodness gracious gollyation! De fat am suah in de fiah now! We'se\ndone los' de earf an' Buttsy an' me will nebber see our happy home no\nmo'.\"\n\n\"Oh, Professor! how could we have left the earth?\" demanded Mark. \"See!\nwe are standing upon it now; at least, this glacier is an ice-river\nof Alaska, and Alaska has not been wiped off the map!\"\n\n\"But that is exactly what has happened to it,\" said the professor,\nearnestly. \"At least, a part of Alaska--we do not know how much of\nthat territory, or how much other territory with it--is no longer a\npart of the sphere called the earth.\"\n\nPhineas Roebach looked at the old scientist as though he thought the\nlatter had taken leave of his senses. But Jack Darrow leaped to the\nright conclusion.\n\n\"You mean, sir, that the earthquake and the volcanic eruption have\ntorn away some great fragment of the world, and we are on it?\"\n\n\"That is what I mean.\"\n\n\"We are floating in space, then--an entirely new world? And _that_ is\nthe old world shining there in the sky?\"\n\n\"That is what has happened, Jack,\" declared Professor Henderson, with\nsolemnity. \"I suspected it when we first felt the lightness of the\natmosphere. I was convinced when I found the ether envelope of this\nnew world--this island in the air, as it were--was so thin. My\ncalculations regarding the rising of the moon, and the outlines of\nobjects upon the great globe hanging yonder, prove to my mind\nconclusively that the awful cataclysm we endured, when we all completely\nlost consciousness, was the time when the eruption occurred, and we,\nwith this great fragment of the earth, were blown out into space.\"\n\n\"It can't be! it can't be!\" shouted Phineas Roebach. \"We've lost our\nheads, perhaps; but we haven't lost our hold on the earth. It's\nnonsense!\"\n\n\"I sincerely wish I could feel that same confidence, Mr. Roebach,\"\nsaid Professor Henderson, drily. \"These instruments of mine, however,\ncannot lie. It is a simple calculation to figure that the moon, now\njust risen, is thousands of miles out of her course, if we are still\non the earth. No, Mr. Roebach, I am stating the exact truth when I say\nthat we have been blown off the earth by that awful volcanic eruption,\nand that we are now floating on a torn-away world, or a new planet,\nin space, doubtless hanging between the earth and the sun. We are as\nunsafe as though we were on a wandering star, or meteor--only this\nisland is not afire. But in time we shall fall into one or the other\ngreater bodies of our system--of that end there can be no possible\ndoubt.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nON AN ISLAND IN THE AIR\n\n\nThe stern and uncompromising statement of Professor Henderson relating\nto the awful fate that had overtaken his friends and Phineas Roebach\nwas so uncompromising--almost brutal--that not a word was spoken for\nseveral minutes.\n\nEven Washington White was dumb. The fact that the fragment of the earth\non which they were imprisoned was floating miles above the globe, in\nthe rarified atmosphere of the outer universe, and that they were at\nthat moment able to look up and see the great, calm, palely glowing\nsphere which had been their home, rolling across the arch above\nthem--all this was too awful a mystery to be grasped immediately by\nthe professor's companions.\n\nJack Darrow, whose mind was the keenest of any, was the first to break\nthe depressing silence. And he spoke in an awed tone that showed how\nfully he realized the horror of their situation, if nothing more.\n\n\"Then, Professor, we are at the mercy of Chance--at any moment this\nfragment of the earth may fall again--or be propelled into the sun?\"\n\n\"We are in the hands of Providence, my boy,\" replied Professor\nHenderson, reverently.\n\n\"The fact remains that we are totally unable to help ourselves,\" said\nJack, firmly. \"Even could we repair the _Snowbird_, and get her out of\nthis crack in the ice, we could not fly to the earth. Between us and the\nearth lies a portion of the universe that has no atmosphere--no\nbreathable air--like that envelope which surrounds the moon. Am I\nright?\"\n\n\"Practically correct, I believe, Jack,\" responded the aged scientist.\n\n\"But,\" cried Mark, at last getting _his_ speech, \"how can such a thing\nbe possible? Blown off the earth! Why, we'd simply go up in the air and\ncome down again.\"\n\n\"Now you're talking sense, young fellow,\" muttered Roebach, still\nrubbing his head as though stunned.\n\n\"Not if we were blown far enough to get beyond the earth's\nattraction--or to get so far away from that body that the sun's\nattraction counterbalances that of the earth,\" replied the professor,\ncalmly.\n\n\"And why do we not fall off?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"We do come pretty near falling off,\" returned Professor Henderson,\ngrimly. \"I should think you could see that, Mark.\"\n\n\"Our lightness!\" Jack cried. \"Washington's jumping and the lightness\nof all objects! I see. This fragment of the earth--this island in the\nair, as you call it, Professor--is large enough to possess some powers\nof attraction of its own; but not as much as the earth. I wonder how\nlarge it really is?\"\n\n\"That is a matter for future discovery,\" returned the scientist, with\nsome eagerness.\n\n\"My goodness me!\" groaned Mark. \"He really enjoys the situation.\"\n\n\"No man has ever been in such a position before--I am convinced of\nthat,\" declared the professor. \"Were it not that you are all in as\nperilous a situation as myself, I would not worry about this condition.\nIt is marvelous, and the situation affords me opportunity to learn\nmany things that science has only guessed at before.\"\n\n\"Don't talk that way!\" wailed the oil man, suddenly. \"You'll make\n_me_ believe in this island in the air business, and I _know_ it's\ncraziness!\"\n\nNor could anything the professor say convince the oil man that there\nwas any common sense in the plain statement of their situation. It was\nbeyond Phineas Roebach's powers of imagination.\n\nAs for Washington White, he could not understand the affair anyway.\nBut he always accepted the professor's words as Bible truth and he had\nno doubt of the surprising fact.\n\n\"We was bound ter git inter trouble, Buttsy an' me, w'en we agreed ter\nstart on any sech foolish journey. And de consanguinuity ob dis 'casion\nassuages me ob de fac' dat we'se only got our come-upance fo' bein'\nso reckless. Now we is nebber gwine ter see de State o' Maine again,\n'ceptin' it is froo de perfesser's telescope.\"\n\nHis complaint received little attention from Jack Darrow or Mark\nSampson; they were too deeply interested in the explanation of the\ncatastrophe that had overtaken them.\n\n\"How big a slice of Alaska do you suppose has been blown off the earth,\nProfessor?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"It may be much more than a part of Alaska,\" replied Mr. Henderson.\n\"Until we have a chance to explore the region more thoroughly I cannot\neven guess the answer to your question.\"\n\n\"And how can we explore it?\" demanded Mark, quickly. \"If there is no\natmosphere on these mountain tops which we see--or, which we saw before\nwe fell into this crevasse--we cannot get off this plane. We are\nimprisoned on the low ground. The lack of air will keep us from climbing\nthe mountains.\"\n\n\"Or from flying over them if we can get the _Snowbird_ into commission\nagain,\" added Jack. \"Every necessity brings its own invention,\" said the\nprofessor. \"Let us not despair. We may yet find some means of traveling\nall about this floating island.\"\n\n\"And what will you do if you get to the edge--fall off?\" exclaimed\nAndy.\n\nHe likewise accepted the professor's words at their face value. He\nnever thought of doubting either the aged scientist's honesty or his\nlearning.\n\n\"If the attraction of this fragment holds good here, it will hold good\nall over its surface,\" proclaimed the professor. \"We have no means yet\nof weighing this torn-away world we are on--this new planet. But it\nmust be of considerable size. Otherwise it would not hang here in space\nas it does.\"\n\n\"And without movement?\" cried Jack.\n\n\"I believe it is circling the earth as the earth circles the sun. We\nare practically on a second moon--only the fires in the heart of our\nyoung planet are not dead.\"\n\n\"I should say they were not dead, if that geyser Mr. Roebach opened up\nis any sign of life,\" remarked Mark.\n\n\"You are quite right, my boy,\" said the professor, cheerfully. \"The\nvolcanic disturbance brought about great earthquakes. These, however,\nwere merely warning symptoms. We did not know it, however. Finally the\ngreat mass of gas formed beneath the earth's crust somewhere about the\nAlaskan coast of the Arctic Ocean, we will say, exploded and forced\nan enormous portion of the crust into the air.\n\n\"No wonder we lost consciousness,\" he continued, with enthusiasm. \"We\nwere probably traveling faster than human beings ever traveled before.\nThe entire nature of the portion of the earth we stood upon was\nchanging. Our atmosphere was changing. We were shot into the sky and\nin a flash were beyond the common influence of what we call the law\nof gravitation.\"\n\n\"But what a hole we must have left in that part of the world!\" gasped\nJack. \"Think of it! The seas must have run right into the chasm and\nmade the bottoms of the old seas dry land.\"\n\n\"Not at all! Not at all!\" returned the professor. \"Think what a mighty\nglobe the earth is. Remember that there are valleys miles\ndeep--mountains miles high! There are holes in the ocean which have\nremained unfathomed to this day! The surface of the earth is very,\nvery rough. What keeps the oceans from overflowing the land and filling\nall those sinks and valleys that are deeper than the ocean bed? Merely\nthe power of attraction which the earth exercises.\n\n\"Suppose explorers hurry to the scene of the great earthquake--to the\nedge of the vast crater which the blowing-out of this portion of the\nearth has left. What will they find--a hole filled with the waters of\nthe Arctic Ocean?\"\n\n\"And why not?\" demanded Jack, stoutly.\n\n\"Because the evidence of our own eyes assures us that such is not the\ncase,\" declared the professor, pointing again to the rolling planet\nthey had so strangely left. \"The earth is not overbalanced. She still\nrolls on her proper course, I have no doubt. The breaking away of this\nisland is not a serious matter to the earth as a whole. The contour\nof the hemispheres is not changed. I showed you how I had traced the\noutlines of the continent before, even, that I was confident we had\nbeen blown off the earth.\n\n\"No. Those who explore the region which we have left will find hills\nand valleys as before--awful crevasses, perhaps, and steaming cauldrons\nof water and mud. No vegetation, of course, but snow has perhaps fallen\non some parts of the raw scar, and those explorers may be able to\ntravel through a region that was--a week ago--the bowels of the earth!\n\n\"The foundation rocks of the earth are left raw and exposed, as they\nmay be after some terrific land-slip. But nothing more. We sail here\nhigh above the earth----\"\n\n\"Looks like we were _below_ it now,\" muttered Mark.\n\n\"But if we have been observed from the earth--and of course those\ngreat telescopes at the Lick Observatory have found us out ere this--we\nwill appear above her,\" said the professor. \"Many things about this\nstrange happening we may only guess at. Of one thing we are sure--we\nhave air to breathe, water to drink, there are wild animals to kill\nfor food, vegetation exists; we are, in fact, upon a miniature world\nwhich is not much different from that we have left--as yet, at least.\"\n\n\"All that sounds mighty fine,\" interrupted Phineas Roebach. \"And I\nexpect you believe it all, Professor Henderson. But there's just one\nthing that _I_ believe: We're down here, two hundred feet or more\nfrom the top of this ice wall, and the game, or the vegetation, or\nanything else, isn't going to help us much while we're here. What I\nwant to know is: How are we going to get out of this crevasse?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nIMPRISONED IN THE ICE\n\n\nThe oil hunter's demand was like a bomb thrown in their midst. The\nboys had been so deeply interested in the professor's relation of\nfacts, and in the scientific phase of their situation, that the more\npractical questions of their mere existence on this island in the air\nhad not before held their attention for long.\n\n\"We've got to find some way of climbing out, I reckon,\" Mark said,\nslowly.\n\n\"Well, find it!\" snapped Phineas Roebach. \"Let's talk of something\npractical. We'll freeze to death down here very soon, if we don't\nstarve first.\"\n\n\"Very true,\" said the professor. \"Mr. Roebach is eminently practical.\nWe must give our attention to the immediate peril that menaces us.\"\n\nAt this moment Andy came forward with two hatchets and an axe.\n\n\"These are the things we want, I guess,\" he said, quietly. \"We've got\nto chop steps in the wall, and climb up in that way.\" \"And abandon all\nour instruments--and the telescope?\" exclaimed Professor Henderson.\n\n\"And the _Snowbird_?\" added Mark.\n\n\"We can hoist all the small things up to the top of this wall--if we\ncan get up there ourselves,\" said the old hunter.\n\n\"Right you are, Mr. Sudds,\" declared Phineas Roebach, with vigor.\n\n\"But the flying machine?\" queried Jack. \"It seems too bad to let it\ngo.\"\n\n\"We won't let it go, Jack,\" declared Mark.\n\n\"Andy is right, boys,\" said the professor. \"Let us first make our own\nescape sure. Then, if it be possible, we will hoist the flying machine\nas well as the instruments and our remaining provisions out of this\nchasm.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid we'll never be able to hoist the _Snowbird_,\" said Jack,\nsadly. \"I reckon we'll have to say good-bye to it.\"\n\n\"Don't lose heart,\" repeated Professor Henderson. \"Lead the way, Andy.\nLet us try chipping the ice away.\"\n\nCold it indeed was down there in the maw of the ice-field; but Wash\nmade some more hot drink and the hunter and the oil man went at the\nice-wall with vigor. They chipped out good, wide steps, two feet apart,\ntwo working together, and mounting upward steadily. The lightness of\ntheir bodies aided not a little in the speed at which they worked.\nBefore an hour had passed they were forty feet above the shelf on which\nthe crippled flying machine rested.\n\nBy that time the earth had rolled out of sight and the moon itself had\npaled into insignificance. There was a bright glow in the sky and the\nparty knew that the sun had risen into view. Deep down as they were\nin the cavity, they soon felt the difference in the temperature. For\nseveral days it had been cold on the earth; but now the sun's heat\nseemed to strike more directly upon the island in the air.\n\nThe wall of ice on the other side of the crevasse began to glisten,\nand soon streams of water were trickling down it, falling with a gentle\nmurmur into the abyss. The workers threw off some of their heavy\nclothing. The sun's rays began to creep down the other wall, and the\nice melted rapidly.\n\nJack and Mark took the places of Andy Sudds and Mr. Roebach with the\nhatchets. The ice on this side of the chasm was still cold and brittle,\nbut the sun was mounting very rapidly toward the zenith and the\ntrickling rills upon the opposite wall of the crevasse became torrents.\n\n\"We are in serious danger,\" Professor Henderson warned them. \"Since\nbeing shot off the world, we have begun a course around our parent\nplanet which brings this portion of the island, at least, in much\ncloser juxtaposition to the sun than Alaska ever was before. I fear\nthat the heat will become tropical in due season.\"\n\n\"And this whole glacier will melt?\" cried Mark, jumping to that\nconclusion instantly.\n\n\"Not all at once, we will hope,\" said the professor. \"If the length\nof the day on this island in the air was as long as the earth's day,\nthe sun might melt the ice so rapidly that we would be washed off this\nwall and drowned in the abyss.\"\n\n\"Gollyation! We's done for den, fo' suah!\" groaned Washington White.\n\n\"But the island will doubtless circle the world in such a way that the\nsun will only strike upon us directly for a few hours at a time--the\nentire circuit we make around the world may be of considerable duration;\nbut the sun will shine directly upon us--at the rate those rays are\ntraveling down that opposite wall--for only a short time. Do you see?\"\n\nThe boys had resigned their turn at the chopping and returned to the\nshelf by now. Again Andy and Mr. Roebach were high above their heads,\nclinging to the slippery wall.\n\nFor the ice on this side, while it was in the shade still, was becoming\nmoist. The heat of the day was intense. Down the opposite wall of the\ncrevasse tumbled a sheet of water which fairly hid the ice itself.\nOccasionally huge blocks of the melting crystal were broken off by the\naction of the water and fell into the chasm with thunderous crashes.\nThere was good reason for the party being worried over their situation.\n\nThe heat increased and over the edge of the wall they sought to climb\nthe water began to pour. Andy Sudds and the oil man were driven down\nfrom their perch. The sun appeared, blazing directly down into the\ncrevasse and the melted ice rained in torrents about them, falling\nupon the _Snowbird_ as though a heavy rainstorm was in progress.\n\nThey fled to the roofed cabin to escape this downpour. But they were\nfearful that at any moment the flying machine, resting so insecurely\nupon the shelf of ice, would be washed into the depths.\n\nA terrible hour followed. The heat became torrid. The splashing of the\nwater and thunder of huge pieces of ice falling into the crack almost\ndeafened them.\n\nJust as the sun had crossed the narrow arc above the crevasse there\ncame a thunderous roar. Used as they had been for some hours to\nexplosions of sound, this one made all tremble. The ice-wall seemed\nto crack and stagger from base to summit. The flying machine shook as\nthough it were about to take flight. But they all knew that the only\nflight it could take was to the bottom of the abyss.\n\nThe thunder of falling ice continued for some minutes. A mighty\navalanche had fallen into the depths. But whether it had fallen from\ntheir side of the crevasse or from the other, they could not at the\nmoment tell.\n\nThe sun was out of sight. Its rays, however, still played upon the\nwall above their heads, while from the lower part of the gulf there\nrose a steam, or fog, which wrapped the flying machine around and\nsmothered all in its embrace.\n\nThe light disappeared from above. The heat of the torrid sun departed.\nThe chill of the fog bit in like a knife. They were glad in an hour\nto get into their furs, and there remained shivering in the damp, cold\nfog, while the streams of water which had poured down the ice-wall\ncongealed again into the hardest of crystal.\n\nRoebach and Andy possessed themselves of two storage battery lamps and\nwent cautiously to examine the wall up which they had climbed for more\nthan a hundred feet.\n\nIt was now as smooth as glass!\n\nThe wash of the falling water had worn away the ice so that the steps\nof their ladder had disappeared. The work they had done toward escape\nhad gone for naught.\n\nThey were just as much prisoners of the ice now as they had been when\nfirst the _Snowbird_ had settled upon this ledge in the crevasse.\nAnd now they lost hope. There seemed no possibility of their escaping\nfrom the gulf by cutting their way out.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nA NIGHT ATTACK\n\n\nIt was the aged scientist who again put heart in the party when Andy\nSudds and Phineas Roebach brought back the report of this catastrophe.\n\n\"We must not give up hope,\" declared Professor Henderson, cheerfully.\n\"We have lost what work has been done on the ice-wall, it is true. But\nwe can begin again.\"\n\n\"And of what use will that be?\" demanded Mark Sampson. \"The sun will\nmelt away the ladder again.\"\n\n\"We have many more hours of night here than we have of daylight--you\ncan all see that, eh?\" said the professor.\n\n\"The sun seemed to shine on us not more than six hours,\" admitted Jack.\n\n\"Less than that, I believe. The rays were not hot more than four and\na half hours. If we begin our work of cutting steps the moment the\nheat of the short day departs, we will be able, I am convinced, to get\nto the top of the ice cliff.\"\n\n\"You're wrong, Professor,\" said Roebach. \"This ice is spongy even\nnow--at least, a good deal of it is. We can't make secure footholds\nin that wall. We're beaten, I tell you--beaten!\"\n\n\"No. Only balked in one way. There are other means of escape,\" declared\nProfessor Henderson.\n\n\"I'd be glad to have you tell us what those means are,\" cried the oil\nman. \"I've racked my brains to think of some other way of getting out.\nI'm beaten, I tell you!\"\n\n\"We will not give up so easily,\" insisted Professor Henderson. \"There\nis no sense in that. We must struggle on. Wait until this fog is\ndissipated. It will soon rise, for the air is becoming extremely cold\nand the fog cannot long endure the frost.\"\n\nThey were indeed suffering much from the increasing cold. The\nchange--and so sudden a change--from the tropical heat of the short\nday to the bitter cold of this ice-gulf was hard to bear.\n\nThe fog thinned perceptibly three hours after the sun had set. Meanwhile\nall but Jack and Washington White had piled up in the cabin for some\nmuch-needed sleep. Jack's wounded hand would not let him rest, so he\noffered to keep watch, while the black man had been reposing most of\nthe time in which Andy and the oil man had dug so strenuously at the\ncliff.\n\n\"Disher proves, Massa Jack, how contrariwise disher world do go,\" Wash\ngrunted. \"Here we starts out ter hunt fo' dat Dr. Todd's chrysomela\nbypunktater plant, an' we don't find it, but nothin' but\ntrouble--lashin's ob trouble! I'se nigh erbout descouraged ober de\nperfesser. He suah do lead us all inter sech tribbilations. I done\nlose heart 'bout him.\"\n\n\"Oh, I wouldn't,\" said Jack. \"The professor can't help it if an old\nvolcano comes along and blows us off the earth. You can't really blame\nhim for that, Wash.\"\n\n\"Well, now,\" said the darkey, \"if he hadn't taken us so far away from\nhome, it wouldn't have happened. We don't nebber have no earfquakes,\nnor no volcanoes in Maine. It's against de law, I reckon--like sellin'\ngin. No, sah I disher awful catastriferous conglomeration ob\nfortituitous happenings dat's put us where we is right now would nebber\nhab got at us if we'd minded our own business an' stayed to home. No,\nsah!\"\n\n\"There may be some truth in what you say--barring your use of the big\nwords, Wash,\" admitted Jack Darrow. \"But we certainly can't blame the\nold professor for any freaks of Nature that may happen.\"\n\n\"No. But I hasn't gotter encourage him in disher foolishness ob runnin'\nup an' down de world, huntin' fo' new t'ings. I don't like new t'ings,\"\ndeclared Wash. \"Looked disher now! Whoeber said Washington White wanted\nter transmogrify hissef to a new planet? Nobody, not dat I hears on.\"\n\n\"I reckon we none of us had much choice in the matter,\" returned Jack,\nwith a sigh.\n\n\"Glory! Dar's dat moon again!\" cried Wash, suddenly.\n\n\"No; it's the earth in sight,\" returned his youthful companion. \"The\nmist is being dissipated, just as the professor said. Let's go out and\nlook about.\"\n\n\"We done wanter be mighty careful walkin' on dis ice,\" admonished the\ndarkey. \"It jest as slippery as it kin be.\"\n\nWhich was true enough, as Jack found the moment he stepped down upon\nthe shelf from the flying machine frame. Where the ice had melted and\nthen its surface had congealed again, it was as smooth as a mirror.\nThe reflected light from the huge globe that now began to traverse the\nsmall arc of their heaven gave them plenty of light. They could see\ndown into the green depths of the crevasse, but not far along the shelf\non which the _Snowbird_ rested, in either the one direction or the\nother.\n\n\"Whar you goin', Massa Jack?\" demanded Wash, as the boy started away\nfrom the flying machine toward the nearest wall of rock that shut in\nthe glacier. \"I want to see what lies beyond that turn,\" replied the\nyouth. \"Perhaps we may learn something to our advantage by exploring\na bit.\"\n\nWashington White followed him very cautiously. Before he came to the\nturn himself, Jack had rounded it. The next moment the darkey was\nstartled by a yell from Jack.\n\n\"Fo' de goodness gracious gollyation sakes!\" bawled Wash. \"What done\ngone an' disturbed de continuity ob your sagastuations? Yo' done\nfrighten me inter a conniption fit if yo' hollers dat way.\"\n\nHere he rounded the turn himself and almost bumped into Jack. Even the\ndarkey's volubility was stilled at the sight before them.\n\nA great part of the wall of the crevasse--the wall which they had hoped\nto climb, had broken off and fallen into the gulf. A wide crack, or\ngully, was opened in this side of the chasm, leading in an easy slope\nto the surface of the glacier.\n\nAlthough their attempt to reach the surface had been foiled, here was\na way which the sun, melting the ice and causing a great avalanche,\nhad made for them. It was plain that all could easily mount to the top\nby this sloping gulch.\n\nJack dashed back to announce the discovery and Wash came after him,\nintent upon seeing that Buttsy was carried, in his well wrapped-up\ncoop, out of the crevasse. The youth awoke his friends instantly and\nin ten minutes all had taken a look at the way of escape and\npreparations were at once made for departure from the flying machine.\n\nEverybody save the professor was laden with stores or instruments, or\nextra clothing and blankets, as they filed away from the crippled\n_Snowbird_. The two youthful inventors and builders of the flying\nmachine bade good-bye to her with full hearts. It was not a certainty\nthat they could recover the flying machine, and Jack and Mark felt\npretty bad about it.\n\nThe first thought of all, however, was centered in standing once more\nupon the surface of the glacier. The fact that the upper part of the\nice field might move at any time, and the crevasse be closed while\nthey were held in it, had troubled them all.\n\nIn half an hour, however, all that danger was past. Other perils might\nimmediately face them; but the chance of being snapped between the\njaws of ice was no more to be feared.\n\nThe golden ball of the earth, around which the island in the air was\nfollowing its orbit, gave them plenty of light as yet, for the sun was\nstill in such a position that its light was reflected from the earth\nupon the fast-traveling island in the sky.\n\nThe party, shaking with cold now, for the night was really arctic in\ntemperature, made for the nearest morainial deposit where trees grew,\nunder the shelter of the cliff which rose so high above the face of\nthe glacier. As the river of ice had pushed its way downward during\nthe past ages, it had scraped earth and stones from the walls of its\nbed, and this deposit, falling on the ice, had given root to trees and\nshrubs, while grass had sprung up and birds had doubtless nested there.\n\n\"They are like the oases in the desert,\" Mark said.\n\n\"They will afford us shelter and firewood,\" the professor added.\n\nAnd in short order they were encamped in a clump of fir trees with a\nhuge fire of dry branches burning before them, its warmth diffused\nover the whole party.\n\nThis grove of sturdy trees was backed close against the base of the\ncliff, and the rocky wall was sheer, mounting at least eight hundred\nfeet above their heads.\n\n\"I suppose no life could exist higher than this cliff, eh, Professor?\"\nJack Darrow asked, as they became comfortable in the fire's warmth and\nthrew back their fur wraps.\n\n\"I am not sure of that, Jack,\" returned the scientist. \"From our\nexperience in the _Snowbird_, since the eruption that threw us off into\nspace, and while on the higher levels of air, we cannot doubt that at a\nthousand feet above this ice, at least, animal life would become\nextinct.\"\n\n\"I reckon there isn't much animal life left in these parts now, at any\nrate,\" Andy Sudds said. \"I don't see what we're going to do if something\ndoesn't turn up for food. We're going to be on short commons.\"\n\nWash had set his \"bird cage,\" as the oil man called the Shanghai's\ncoop, within the warmth of the fire, and the rooster evidently felt\nthe grateful glow of the flames. He had been picking up some corn that\nWash flung him, grain by grain. Now he suddenly stopped, raised his\nhead, and uttered a loud and apparently frightened squawk.\n\n\"What dat?\" demanded the darkey, his eyes rolling. \"Buttsy hear\nsumpin'--he suah do.\"\n\n\"What do you reckon he hears?\" queried Jack, idly.\n\n\"I dunno dat. But he's some disturbed--yo' kin see it's so,\" returned\nWashington, nervously. \"Does yo' hear anything yit?\"\n\n\"You think he can smell out an enemy, do you?\" chuckled Jack.\n\n\"He done gotter great head, Buttsy has,\" declared the black man. \"If\ndere is anyt'ing prowlin' aroun' permiscuous like, he's de boy to hear\n'em--yes, sah!\" \"By the same token it was a flock of geese that saved\nRome,\" Mark said.\n\nWash had his back to the thick clump of firs. Jack was facing him.\nSuddenly the boy, raising his eyes to look across the fire at the\ndarkey, beheld a huge black object rise out of the brush directly in\nWashington's rear.\n\nOne glance told Jack what the creature was. There was no mistaking the\ngleaming eyes, the pointed, slobbering muzzle, and the hairy, yellowish\nbreast of the gigantic Kodiak bear as it poised its huge body over the\nunconscious darkey.\n\nLike a ghost the bear had crept to the camp of the explorers and was\nnow on the eve of an attack, totally unheralded!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nTHE HEROISM OF THE SHANGHAI ROOSTER\n\n\nJack Darrow was the only person in the group around the campfire who\nat first saw the huge bear. And he was so startled that for a breath\nhe did not know what it was best to do. To shriek out in alarm would\nneither save the darkey nor frighten off the bear.\n\nThe Shanghai rooster settled down with a half-stifled squawk in the\nbottom of his coop. Without doubt the bird saw the bear and realized\nthat his life was in peril.\n\n\"What de matter wid yo'?\" demanded Washington, rolling his eyes and\nbeginning to look scared himself.\n\nJack's mouth was dry and he had to wet his lips before he could as\nmuch as whisper. Only a few seconds had elapsed since the bear rose\ninto view behind the darkey; but it seemed to Jack as though an eternity\nhad passed.\n\nHis whispered words were for the old hunter, whom he knew was always\nalert.\n\n\"Andy! Your rifle!\"\n\nThe brown claw of the old hunter was never far from the grip of his\ngun when he lay before a campfire. Jack saw the hand clamp upon the\nweapon even before Sudds rolled over.\n\n\"What's up, Jack?\" he whispered.\n\n\"Behind Wash--quick!\"\n\nNo need to tell the hunter to be quick. He was on his knees and the\ngun was at his shoulder in the twinkling of an eye.\n\n\"Come here, Wash--quick!\" ejaculated Jack, with sudden inspiration,\nand the darkey, used to obeying orders without question, scrambled up\nand started toward the boy.\n\nWith a roar that brought every other person save the old hunter to his\nfeet, the huge bear swung both front paws to grab the negro. Wash\nescaped the embrace by the breadth of a hair.\n\nBang! spoke Andy Sudds' rifle.\n\n\"Gollyation! I'se done shot!\" bawled the darkey, and sprang into Jack's\narms.\n\nThe boy hung on to him or perhaps Wash would still be running, he was\nso scared. Nor were the other members of the party much less startled.\n\nBut Andy Sudds was as steady as a rock. His first ball had hit the\nhuge beast in the breast, but the latter had plunged forward after the\nescaping darkey as the ball struck him. Therefore the wound was too\nhigh up to do serious damage.\n\nA grizzly, or Kodiak, bear has never yet been settled by a single\nshot--unless the bullet entering the beast's carcass was explosive.\nWith a mighty roar the bear plunged forward, right through the fire,\nscattering it far and wide and aiming directly for the place from which\nthe rifle ball had come. It had stung him, and he was after the old\nhunter on the instant.\n\nHe half fell over the coop which contained the Shanghai rooster.\nIrritable as he could be, the bear delayed long enough to strike at\nthis coop. He smashed one end of it flat, but the Shanghai miraculously\nescaped injury.\n\nThe bird had undoubtedly been disturbed and frightened by the secret\napproach of Bruin; but once free, the feathered creature felt his\ndignity disturbed, and finding himself free of the coop, he flew with\na loud squawk at the charging bear.\n\nAndy had pumped two more bullets after his first one. Both had found\ntheir billet in the body of the bear; but neither had struck a vital\nspot. The scattering fire, as the beast plowed through the embers,\ndrove the rest of the party out of range in a hurry. Jack dragged Wash\nto one side; but the darkey yelled:\n\n\"Gollyation! I wanter save Buttsy! Oh, lawsy-massy! Dat Shanghai suahly\nis a reckless bird!\"\n\nIn the flaring light of the flames the rooster was seen to pounce upon\nthe shoulders of the huge bear as the latter came down to \"all-fours\"\nand dived at the old hunter. Andy sprang back, collided with a\ntree-trunk, and went head over heels. In an instant the bear would\nhave been upon him and one stroke of his sabre-like claws would have\nfinished Andy Sudds.\n\nBut the rooster certainly did delay the bear's charge. The brute struck\nat his feathered tormentor with first one fore paw, and then the other.\nHe failed to dislodge his enemy by such means.\n\nAnd then a big ember behind him snapped and a part of the flaming\nbranch fell upon the ground just where Bruin put his hind paw upon it.\nPlowing through the blaze in a hurry was one thing--_this_ was an\nentirely different proposition.\n\nBruin uttered a roar of pain and turned to bite at the stung paw. As\nhe swung his huge body about, the blood now spouting from his jaws--for\none of the bullets had punctured a lung--Andy came into position again,\nwith the muzzle of his rifle less than ten feet from the hairy side.\n\nBang!\n\nAn answering roar of rage and pain followed the shot. The beast tried\nto whirl again, but fell instead. The rooster fled, squawking, into\nthe bush.\n\nThe huge bear struggled on the ground for some moments before anybody\ndared approach. It was Wash who first dashed in and planted a foot\nupon the dead beast's neck.\n\n\"See wot dat Shanghai done?\" he cried. \"Wot you gotter say now ter\nChristopher Columbus Amerigo Vespucci George Washington Abraham Lincoln\nUlysses Grant Garibaldi Thomas Edison Guglielmo Marconi Butts?\"\n\n\"I got to take off my hat to the rooster,\" Andy Sudds said, quietly.\n\"If it hadn't been for him that bear would have had me as sure as\nshootin'!\"\n\n\"Butts is a hero--no doubt of that,\" gasped Jack Darrow, when he could\nget his breath.\n\nThe others--even Professor Henderson--were greatly excited by the\nincident and delighted by its outcome. Here was fresh meat in abundance,\nto say nothing of a fine blanket-robe, if they could take the time to\nstretch and \"work\" the hide. Andy promised to do that the next day if\nthey would camp where they were long enough.\n\nMeanwhile the bear was skinned and certain steaks cut off for immediate\nconsumption, while the bulk of the carcass was cached under some blocks\nof ice on the glacier. Andy was for smoking some strips of meat over\nthe rebuilt fire.\n\n\"You see, Professor, it's so hot in the daytime here, and so cold at\nnight, that pemmican is about the only kind of meat that will\nkeep--unless it's canned. We'll eat what we can of the fresh bear\nsteaks; but these strips will be all right smoked a long time after\nthe fresh meat has become too strong for anything but a buzzard,\" quoth\nthe hunter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nMARK ON GUARD\n\n\nAfter the hearty supper, and the excitement of the bear-killing, they\nwere all more or less ready for bed. The professor figured that the\nsun would not appear again to the Crusoes on this island in the air\nfor quite fourteen hours. They all ought to get sufficient sleep before\nthat time. The havoc wrought by the rays of the torrid sun upon the\nglacier had been apparent as they came over it to this fringe of trees\nat the base of the cliff. It might be necessary for them to move quickly\nfrom the ice to save their lives.\n\n\"We can afford to spend some hours in rest, and will start with bodies\nrefreshed, at least. Now we will divide the watches,\" suggested the\nscientist.\n\nBut the others would not hear of the professor going on guard. Andy\ndeclared for the first watch, for he had to 'tend his \"jerked\" bear\nmeat. And following him the die fell to Mark. The old hunter awoke the\nyouth some four hours after the camp had become quiet for the night.\n\nThe earth was then hanging low on their horizon, while the moon was\nclimbing up from the east, the reflected light of both orbs flooding\nthe surface of the ice-field.\n\nMark came out of his warm nest yawning like a good fellow, and the old\nhunter said to him:\n\n\"Take that axe yonder and cut some wood for the fire. Keep up a good\nblaze and that will keep us comfortable as well as keep you awake. I\ndon't want you to go to sleep, Mark.\"\n\n\"Who's going to sleep?\" cried Mark, much abused.\n\nBut he had to confess to himself that he _was_ mighty drowsy when\nhe had finished cutting up the wood a little way from the camp. He\ntook a turn or two, replenished the fire, and then backed up against\na sheltering tree-bole and blinked at the dancing flames.\n\nSleep overtakes one suddenly and strangely at times. Without intending\nto even close one eye, Mark was off into dreamland with a promptness\nthat was surprising. He settled back against the tree and slept standing\nup. But his neglected duty troubled his subconscious mind. He was\nuneasy. In his dreams he was troubled by nameless dread. He awoke at\nlast seemingly with a scream of human agony in his ears.\n\nHad something happened to his comrades during his brief defection?\nMark sprang erect and looked over the sleeping camp. Every person was\nin his place, but the fire was low. It had been, perhaps, an imagined\nsound that aroused him so suddenly.\n\nHe threw more wood on the fire and stepped out upon the ice to get\nmore of the fuel he had previously cut into handy lengths. This\nmorainial deposit which offered rootage for the trees and bushes was\nbut a narrow streak--a sort of an island on the glacier. They had\ncarried the bear meat out to a small sink in the ice where there were\ngreat slabs of the hard crystal which were easily packed over the meat.\nAs Mark started for the wood he heard a noise out on the ice in the\ndirection of their cache. He picked up his rifle again quickly and\nstarted for the spot. Something was disturbing the meat, and Mark did\nnot lack courage. His rifle was loaded and, thanks to Andy, he was a\ngood shot. The old hunter took pride in training the boys to shoot\nwell.\n\nThe youth did not stop to ask what manner of enemy it was disturbing\ntheir cache. And it never entered his head to disturb the camp. He ran\nright out upon the glacier and had advanced to within a few yards of\nthe spot before he learned what he was up against, for a huge block\nof ice hid the cache from his view.\n\nAround this ice-block, from either side, as though they had been waiting\npurposely to ambuscade him, shot several animals, who charged him\nwithout as much as a whine.\n\n\"Dogs!\" thought Mark, remembering the Alaskans that Phineas Roebach\nhad been forced to abandon. \"They have gone mad.\"\n\nBut the next moment he saw his mistake. They were wolves--huge, gaunt,\nshaggy fellows, with gaping jaws displaying rows of ferocious teeth.\nThey charged him in awful silence, their great claws scratching over\nthe ice.\n\nThere were eight or ten of them in sight and they were only a few yards\naway from the youth when he first saw them. But instantly Mark dropped\nto one knee to steady himself, put the rifle to his shoulder, and\nopened fire.\n\nFour shots he placed in quick succession. Two of the wolves rolled\nover and over upon the ice, and a third limped off after the remainder,\nwho darted behind the ice-block again. Mark leaped up, uttering a shout\nof triumph, and followed them, believing that he had beaten the pack\nthus easily.\n\nBut the moment he came around the obstruction he found himself in the\nmidst of the actual pack. He was not charged by a dozen of the fierce\ncreatures, but by more than half a hundred.\n\nThe wolves had raided the cache already, having torn away the blocks\nof ice, and were feasting on the half-frozen bear meat. Mark did not\nthink at that moment of driving them away, however; he wanted to get\naway himself.\n\nHis shots had aroused the camp, although he was some distance from it.\nBut when his friends ran out upon the ice they did not see him, and\nnobody for the minute suspected what had happened or where the youth\nhad gone. The two bodies of the wolves were not at first sighted.\n\nMark did not have a chance to use his rifle again. The wolves seemed\nto rush him from all sides, and a huge gray fellow leaped against him,\nknocking the rifle from the lad's grasp and rolling him over and over,\nhalf stunned, upon the ice.\n\nBy marvelous good fortune none of the savage beasts followed him for\nthe moment. The wounded wolf took up their attention. They pitched\nupon him and before Mark could rise to his feet the savage brutes had\ntorn their wounded comrade limb from limb.\n\nThe ice was stained crimson and their slobbering jaws ran blood. A\nmore terrifying sight the youth had seldom seen. He could not reach\nhis rifle, and the bulk of the pack was between him and the way he had\ncome. He therefore leaped away in the other direction, running from\ninstead of toward his friends.\n\nHe passed through the thinning pack without being touched, although\nseveral of the beasts snapped at him and the clashing of their fangs\nsent cold chills up and down his spine. Then he leaped away at top\nspeed across the ice.\n\nIt was a natural move, but a very unwise one. The wolves tore their\ncomrade to pieces and bolted the pieces in about sixty seconds. Then\nthey wheeled en masse and shot off across the glacier after the boy.\n\nMark ran about as fast as he had ever run before. Fortunately he had\nspurs in his boot-soles and therefore he did not slip on the ice. But\nsuddenly he found that he was crossing a smooth sheet of new ice--the\nsurface of a lake in the glacier. This lake had frozen after the sun\nwent down and Mark felt the new ice bend under him as he ran.\n\nThe moonlight revealed his path before him plainly; but the now yapping\npack behind took up so much of his attention that Mark did not take\na careful view of the surface of the thinly frozen lake.\n\nThe leaders were all but upon him in a very few moments. As the first\nwolf leaped, Mark threw himself sideways and ran off at a tangent,\nholding his feet much better than did the brutes. They went scratching\nalong the smooth ice for some yards before they could change their\ncourse.\n\nThe turn, however, put Mark in a serious position. He found the thin\nice cracking loudly under his feet. He glanced ahead. There was a\nstreak of open water.\n\nHe tried to turn again, but this time his spurs slipped. He went down\non the ice. The first two wolves were a-top of him and one seized his\narm. But luckily it was protected by his thick coat sleeve.\n\nThen the wolves darted back from the prone, sliding body of the boy.\nThey saw their peril; Mark could not help himself.\n\nWith a shriek and splash he was struggling in the deadly cold water\nof the lake. He plunged beneath the black surface while the yapping\npack halted upon the very verge of the broken ice.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nTHE WOLF TRAIL\n\n\nThe hole into which Mark fell was not many yards across; but when he\ncame to the surface of the icy water he found that the edge of the\nstrong ice was fringed with open jaws and lolling, blood-red tongues.\nThe wolves had surrounded the open bit of water and were prepared to\nwelcome him with wide jaws wherever he sought to climb out.\n\nThe lad knew well enough that he was helpless against these foes. To\nseek to reach the ice would be to give himself up to the savage brutes.\nNor could he remain long afloat in this ice-cold water. He was already\nchilled to his very marrow.\n\nMark was in a perilous position indeed. He could bear up but a few\nmoments. He knew that if he again sank beneath the surface he would\nnever rise again.\n\nAnd so he struggled mightily to keep his head above water. The wolves\ndid not dare leap in to seize him; they did not have to. In their\ncanine minds they probably knew that the boy would have to come to\nthem. But fortunately for Mark the wolves had given tongue when they\nchased him over the ice. Otherwise the boy's friends might not have\nbeen warned of his predicament until too late to be of assistance to\nhim.\n\nBut the moment the wolves gave tongue Andy Sudds had started with a\nwhoop for the cache of bear meat. Jack and Phineas Roebach followed\nwith their weapons.\n\nComing in sight of the slavering pack, as they whined about the open\nwater-hole in the lake, Andy advised his companions as to the situation\nand they deployed so as to shoot into the pack of wolves without sending\ntheir bullets in the direction of the half-drowned Mark.\n\nAll using magazine rifles, they were enabled to send such a fusillade\ninto the wolves that the pack was scattered in a few moments. Then\nthey ran on to the edge of the broken ice, finding at least a dozen\ndead brutes lying about the water-hole.\n\nJack lay down and reached his gun barrel out to his chum and by its\naid Mark got to the edge of the ice and scrambled out of the water.\nThey ran him back to the campfire in short order and then Andy set out\nto make a second attack upon the wolves, the pack having returned to\neat up their comrades.\n\nHowever, the beasts had already been punished enough. They could not\nstand before the old hunter, and ran howling down the glacier.\n\n\"One thing about it,\" Andy Sudds said, \"we can make up our minds there\nis an outlet from this field of ice in that direction. To escape we\nhave only to follow the wolf trail.\"\n\nThey were not in shape to travel at once, however. Jack's hand pained\nhim frightfully after his work in helping Mark escape from the water,\nand Mark, himself had a serious chill before sunrise. Treated by the\nprofessor, however, the youth quickly recovered from his plunge into\nthe lake.\n\nBut it was decided, nevertheless, to wait over another of the short,\ntorrid days before leaving the trees, for the traveling by night would\nbe much more practicable. So they were leisurely eating another meal\nof bear steak when the sun touched the horizon with rosy light.\n\nThe dawn broke in what Jack termed \"record time,\" and Washington White\ngave vent to his surprise in characteristic language:\n\n\"I done seed de sun rise in eb'ry clime, f'om de Arctic t'rough de\ntropical to the Antarctic kentries. But de speed wid w'ich disher sun\npops up is enough ter tear de bastin 't'reads loose from de Universe--it\nsuah is! I finds mahself,\" continued Wash, reflectively,\n\"circumnavigatin' ma mind to de eend dat disher 'sperience we is all\ngoin' t'rough is a hallucination ob de brain. In odder words, we is\nall climbin' trees an' makin' a noise like de nuts wot grows dere. Do\nyou hear me?\"\n\n\"We hear you,\" said Jack. \"And if you think you're crazy, all right.\nI don't feel like joining you in the foolish factory yet awhile.\"\n\n\"I more than half believe the darkey's right,\" muttered Phineas Roebach.\n\"This experience is enough to turn the brain of any man. I don't myself\nbelieve half the things we are seeing.\"\n\nThe heat of the sun, as soon as it had well risen, was a fact that\ncould scarcely be doubted, however. They were glad to seek the shade\nof the fir trees, and the surface of the glacier began to melt with\na rapidity that not only surprised, but startled them.\n\nA flood of water, like a great river, began to sweep by the narrow bit\nof earth on which they were encamped. The roar of the falling water\ninto the crevasse from which they had so fortunately escaped soon\nbecame deafening.\n\nThey all had to remove their outer garments. The smell of the heated\nfir branches was like the odor of a forest on a hot August afternoon.\nProfessor Henderson watched the melting of the ice with a serious face.\nWhen Mark asked him what he thought threatened their safety, the old\nscientist replied:\n\n\"I _am_ serious, that is true, my boy. I see in this terrible heat the\nthreat of a great and sudden change in this glacier. We must start as\nsoon as the freeze comes on to-night, and travel as fast as we can\ntoward the far end. Mr. Roebach knows the trail, I believe?\"\n\n\"I've been over it several times; but I must say that the glacier has\nsunk a whole lot since I was across it before,\" the oil man declared.\n\n\"We can follow the wolves,\" said Andy Sudds, stoutly. \"They knew their\nway out.\"\n\n\"That is true, we will hope,\" Professor Henderson said. \"For I must\nstate that I believe our peril is very great.\"\n\n\"How so, sir?\" Jack queried.\n\n\"We do not know how soon this glacier may move on.\"\n\n\"Another earthquake?\" cried Mark.\n\n\"Oh, gollyation! I suttenly hopes not,\" wailed Wash.\n\n\"No. I do not think we need apprehend any further seismic disturbance.\nSuch gaseous trouble as there is in the heart of this island will find\nescape--if I do not mistake--through Mr. Roebach's oil well.\"\n\n\"Then what is troubling you, sir?\" queried the boys in chorus.\n\n\"The knowledge I possess of the nature of glaciers leads me to fear\nthis peril,\" replied the aged scientist. \"Under the immediate conditions\nthis vast river of ice may move forward at any moment.\"\n\n\"Impossible, I tell you!\" interrupted Phineas Roebach. \"I tell you\nthis is a 'dead' glacier. It has not been in motion for ages. I have\nseen the face of it at the lower end of this valley. There is only a\nsmall stream of water trickling from under it, and the forest has grown\nright up to the base of the ice wall.\"\n\n\"And how big a stream do you suppose is flowing from beneath the glacier\nnow, and working its way toward what was once the Arctic Ocean--or\nBeaufort Sea?\" queried the professor.\n\n\"Why--why---\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" concluded Mr. Henderson, sharply. \"You had not thought of\nthat. You see this vast amount of water pouring into yonder crevasse?\nWater cannot run up hill. It is bound to seek a lower level. It must\nforce its way down the valley, beneath the glacier, and so stream out\nfrom beneath the ice at the far end.\n\n\"Gradually this flow of water is going to wear away the ice--is going\nto loosen the entire glacier. And then, suddenly, with no warning at\nall, the field will plunge forward--break up, sink, grind itself to\npowder against these cliffs! And where will we be?\"\n\n\"My goodness gracious gollyation!\" cried Washington White. \"I wants\nto git out o' disher right away--me an' Buttsy is ready ter go ter\nonct, an' no mistake!\"\n\n\"What will you do--swim?\" queried Jack, pointing to the river that was\nnow washing the shore of the strip of soil on which they stood--a river\nwhich seemed to stretch the entire breadth of the glacier.\n\nJack and Mark were deeply impressed by the good sense of the professor's\nobservations; and both Andy and Roebach were disturbed. They watched\nthe disintegration of the ice with considerable worriment. It seemed\nto melt away much quicker during these hours of sunshine than it had\non the previous occasion when the orb of day shone fully upon the\nsurface of the island in the air.\n\nThe soil they had camped upon began to crumble away, too, for the heat\nwas insidiously melting the ice under the morainial deposit. At the\ntime which should be high noon--when the sun was directly overhead in\nits course--one end of the patch of soil, forest and all, slumped into\nthe water with a loud crash, and at once the fierce current tore the\nrubbish apart and carried it onward to the brink of the crevasse, into\nthe maw of which it fell.\n\n\"Wash is perfectly right in his statement,\" Jack Darrow said. \"This\nis no place for any of us. As soon as the ice freezes up after the sun\nsets we must travel as fast as we can after the wolves.\"\n\n\"And I wish we could travel as fast as they can,\" muttered Andy Sudds.\n\n\"I wish we had Mr. Roebach's dogs and sleds,\" said Mark.\n\n\"All right. As long as you're wishing, though, why not wish for the\nright thing?\" demanded Jack.\n\n\"And what is that, Master Jack?\" asked the oil man.\n\n\"Wish we were aboard the _Snowbird_ and that she was all right. That's\nwhat _I_ wish.\"\n\n\"And I reckon the boy's right,\" said Phineas Roebach, with a sigh. \"As\nmuch as I object to flying through the air, an airship now would be\na God-send indeed.\"\n\nWhat bear meat the wolves had not destroyed the water now washed away.\nThe party had only that which Andy had smoked over the fire. But this\nwas easily carried and their packs were not heavy when they prepared\nto leave the camp as soon after sunset as the frost would allow.\n\nThe terrific change from the heat of midsummer to the cold of midwinter,\nand all within something near twenty-four hours, was hard indeed to\nbear. The professor calculated that the drop in temperature from high\nnoon was, two hours after sunset, exactly seventy degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n\"Human life will become extinct upon this fragmentary planet, if nothing\nfurther happens to it, in a very few years,\" he said, thoughtfully.\n\"We are not attuned to such frightful changes.\"\n\nThey had eaten, and had packed their supplies. The earth had long since\nappeared again and the radiance she reflected fell softly upon the\nice-field. It glistened like silver, stretching, miles and miles away\nbefore them when they climbed down from the fringe of trees in which\nthey had encamped, and set out down the glacier.\n\nThey traveled carefully at first, for there were sinks in the ice which\nhad barely skimmed over since sun-down. The thermometer registered 18\nabove zero, however, and the biting cold was congealing all lakes and\npools very rapidly. Where they tramped through the slush their\nfootprints froze behind them. In an hour the mercury had fallen ten\ndegrees more and they were beating their gloved hands across their\nbreasts to keep up the circulation.\n\nThey tramped on at good speed for several hours. Here and there along\neither edge of the glacier, were groves of fir trees like the one they\nhad encamped in. But in places the ice had melted from under and around\nthese patches of rock and soil and the roots of the trees were exposed,\nwhile the earth had slumped away in small land-slips until nothing but\na heap of debris was left.\n\nThe old professor grew weary and Andy insisted upon making camp again\nand resting. While they were warming themselves over the fire the old\nhunter built, and Wash was boiling some coffee, Jack suddenly beheld\nseveral shining points of light in the little wood on the edge of which\nthey had halted.\n\n\"Look out! We're being watched,\" he whispered in Andy's ear.\n\nThe hunter grabbed his rifle and looked where Jack pointed. At once\nhe seemed relieved.\n\n\"The wolves,\" he said. \"They know their way out of this valley. I don't\nwant to travel on this ice any longer than I can help.\"\n\nWith a word to the professor, and taking Roebach with him, the old\nhunter made a determined charge into the brush at the lurking wolves.\nThe pack scattered at first, but finding themselves determinedly\nfollowed, and both hunters having been wise enough to take torches\nwith them (for wolves are very much afraid of fire) the pack finally\ngathered once more and trailed away up a narrow path upon the rocky\nwall close at hand.\n\nIn the white light furnished by the earth-planet Andy counted thirty\nand more of the beasts climbing this rugged path. He was sure it was\nno mere lair they went to among the rocks, but a path leading out of\nthe valley altogether. Therefore, when the party was again refreshed,\nthey took up their line of march, in single file, following the wolf\ntrail.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nTHE FIGHT AT ALEUKAN\n\n\nPhineas Roebach knew nothing about this narrow defile through which\nthe party traveled. But he agreed that they were breaking through the\nwall of the glacier on the right side. Aleukan, the big native\nsettlement, was in this direction.\n\nThere seemed to be a narrow crack through this cliff which had guarded\nthe river of ice. It had never been used by man as a right of way, but\nthe beasts of the wilderness had used it from time immemorial, as the\nmarks along the way proclaimed.\n\nThe scurrying feet of the wolf pack, were long since out of the way.\nBut yonder a mountain sheep had been killed by a puma, or other big\nfeline, and the wolves had picked its bones after the Master of the\nChase had eaten his fill.\n\nWhere a little rill of sweet water sprang from between two boulders,\nboiling out white sand from the depths of its spring, was the print\nof a bear's paw. Many of these marks Jack and Mark saw for themselves;\nbut Andy was quick to point them out as he led the way up the steep\npath.\n\nTheir progress was necessarily slow because of the aged professor.\nAlthough the scientist was not the man to retard the party, Andy would\nlet nobody take the lead but himself, so that he could watch the old\nman's flagging steps and call a halt whenever he thought it best for\nMr. Henderson to rest.\n\n\"You are babying me, Andy!\" ejaculated the professor, with some\nirritation.\n\n\"You're the most important person in this party, sir,\" declared the\nhunter. \"We can lose any other person and not miss him much. But without\nyou we'd be without a head.\"\n\nTherefore, when they had clambered through the last steep cut and\nreached the farther slope of the cliff, the hunter called a halt and\nbuilt a camp, determined to bivouac here although the oil man assured\nhim that they were now less than twenty miles from Aleukan.\n\nA few hours later they awoke to find the sun rising once more and the\nheat of the exposed hillside becoming unbearable. Were it not for the\nwonderful clearness of the air they could not have stood the heat at\nall. But all agreed that they would better descend the hill to the\nforest and so be sheltered from the direct rays of the sun.\n\nThe bearing of their extra clothing in this tropical heat was an effort,\nand they were all glad to find shelter beneath the huge-limbed trees\nat the foot of the slope.\n\nThere they lay in the shade and discussed the direction they should\ntravel from this point. It was not until this time they discovered\nthat their pocket compasses pointed the north as being in a totally\ndifferent direction from what they had supposed. Phineas Roebach had\ndeclared the native settlement of Aleukan to be directly north and\nwest of the place where he had tapped the mud-spouter. But now, although\nhe was positive of the contour of the hills and the line of peaks of\nthe Endicott Range under which Aleukan was established, their compasses\nmade the direction southwest.\n\n\"Not at all strange, sir,\" said Professor Henderson. \"In becoming\ndetached from the old earth, our new planet was shifted a good bit,\nand that which was to the north is now almost west. If, by chance,\nthis island in the air includes that point on the earth's surface which\nonce represented the most northerly spot--the North Pole, in fact--it\nis the North Pole no longer. The magnetic needle points instead to a\nnew North Pole, established on this fragment of a planet since it was\nshot off into space from its parent world.\"\n\nPhineas Roebach grunted his disbelief in all this. He could not get\nit into his head that they were riding on a piece of the old earth\nfar, far above that stable planet. He would not believe it. No marvel\nof this situation could change his belief. He would not accept the\nprofessor's theory of what had happened to them.\n\nThe sun went down again and the frost began to creep after it. Already\nthe bulk of vegetation about them (save the hardy firs and kindred\ntrees and shrubs) were black and dead. The change in climate had tolled\nthe knell of all those plants that had withstood heretofore the rigors\nof the Alaskan summer.\n\n\"What do you suppose has happened to the _Chrysothele-Byzantium_\nherb that Dr. Todd sent us for?\" demanded Jack Darrow. \"Seems to me\nthat will be badly frost-bitten by the time we find it; won't it?\"\n\n\"I fear so, indeed,\" admitted Professor Henderson.\n\n\"Lawsy-massy!\" gasped Wash. \"Do yo' mean ter tell me dat we ain't gwine\nter fin' dat chrysomela bypunktater plant after all? What fo' did we\ncome away off here on dis floatin' islan' if we ain't gwine ter git\ndat specimen of botanical horrorforbilicalness? I done hoped I could\ntell ma friends w'en I returned dat we done was successful, an' cure\nsome ob dem ob craziness in de haid by applyin' some ob de bypunktater.\nIf we don't find it, den dey all say we been follerin' a\nchimera-infantum--in odder words, dat we needs some ob de bypunktater\nour own selfs!\"\n\n\"You mean,\" said Jack, seriously, \"that they will think we are crazy\nif we do not bring home what we were sent for?\"\n\n\"Dat's wot I done said,\" grumbled the colored man.\n\n\"No, you didn't say it; but you meant it, most likely,\" admitted Jack.\n\"And I reckon you are right. It does seem as though we have come a\nlong way for nothing.\"\n\n\"And no likelihood of our ever getting back!\" added Mark, despondently.\n\nBut this was out of the professor's hearing. The party was already on\ntheir way again, and the traveling was much easier now. Andy and Roebach\nled the way, followed by the professor and the boys, Wash, with his\nrooster in a fur bag, following on behind. They covered the twenty\nmiles to the hilltop which overlooked Aleukan without making more than\none short stop. By that time both the earth and her largest satellite,\nthe moon, were shining brightly upon this little planet on which our\nfriends had become marooned.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" cried Jack. \"We are _somewhere_ at last! Do you suppose\nthose supplies got over from Coldfoot before that last eruption?\" \"If\nthe train did not arrive before that time,\" said Mark, \"make up your\nmind that it never will arrive. Probably there is no Coldfoot on this\nplanet.\"\n\n\"There are some natives on hand, at least,\" said the professor, with\nsatisfaction.\n\nThey indeed saw several men moving about the town; but Phineas Roebach\ndid not seem at all pleased.\n\n\"I don't like that a bit,\" he declared.\n\n\"Don't like what?\" asked Andy Sudds, quickly.\n\n\"There's always a slather of squaws and children around Aleukan. There\nare two white traders here, too--one representing the Hudson Bay Company\nand the other working for the French Company. And always a heap of\ndogs are in sight.\"\n\n\"What do you suppose is the matter?\" Jack queried.\n\n\"Don't know,\" grunted the oil man. \"Looks as though the squaws and\nyoung ones had been sent off with the sleds. Why, those fellows are\nall armed, too!\"\n\n\"I expect that the strange happenings have puzzled and frightened the\naborigines,\" suggested Professor Henderson. \"We had better go down\ninto the town and try to allay their fears.\"\n\nThe hunter and Roebach evidently had their doubts regarding the wisdom\nof this move. Yet they had come all this distance for the express\npurpose of going into Aleukan. They set out down the trail to enter\nthe big village of cabins and skin huts.\n\nSuddenly the group of bucks in the principal street of the town turned\nand ran shouting toward the little party descending from the heights.\nTheir actions were extremely warlike.\n\nThen up from a side gulch appeared twice as many other Indians, armed\nwith spears and guns. Several shots were fired at the party approaching\nthe town.\n\n\"Lawsy-massy!\" yelled Washington White. \"Disher don't seem like de\nus'al 'Welcome to our City' warcry. Dem fellers don't want us nohow!\"\n\n\"Now we see just how popular we are with the natives of Alaska,\" said\nJack. \"What do you think of it, Mark?\"\n\n\"I think we're in bad,\" returned his chum, gripping his rifle nervously.\n\n\"Quite remarkable! quite remarkable!\" repeated Professor Henderson.\n\n\"Back to that bunch o' rocks!\" shouted Andy Sudds, who had taken in\nthe strategic advantages of a position they had just passed, at a\nglance.\n\nAll saw the wisdom of the old hunter's suggestion. They hurried to the\ngroup of boulders. They made a natural breastwork behind which a few\ndetermined men could hold at bay a horde of enemies--for a time, at\nleast.\n\n\"The Indians are coming right on,\" cried Mark, excitedly.\n\n\"And I see some of my old workmen among them,\" declared Phineas Roebach.\n\"That is what is the trouble. Those fellows have got it into their\nheads that we are somehow the cause of these misfortunes that have\novertaken this part of the hemisphere.\"\n\n\"You go out and parley with them, Mr. Roebach,\" suggested the professor.\n\n\"You can't parley with them while their 'mad' is up,\" said the oil\nman. \"They're charging. Give them a volley--and don't be afraid to\nshoot low. They will listen better to reason after they taste some of\nour lead.\"\n\nHis final words were lost in the explosion of the guns. All but the\nprofessor fired. He had no weapon. Several Indians fell, wounded in\nthe legs, for all had taken Roebach's advice and fired low.\n\nWith shrieks of rage and pain the Aleuts fell back, and found shelter\nfor themselves behind trees and rocks. But they were not minded to\ngive up the fight so easily. They gradually extended their line of\nbattle until they had our friends completely surrounded. Their desultory\nfire, however, did not at first do any damage to those in the fortress,\nand the whites replied only occasionally, taking careful aim and winging\nan Indian at almost every shot.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nTHE FLIGHT TOWARD THE COAST\n\n\nWashington White was a good shot, but he did not like fighting. And\nhe was particularly careful not to show himself above the breastwork\nof boulders behind which he, with his companions, were crouching,\nholding the Aleuts at bay.\n\n\"Disher ain't no place for a'spectable pusson ob color,\" he muttered.\n\"Wot do Buttsy an' me want o' shootin'? Wah! Dat bullet chipped de\nrock right near ma haid! Ain't dat Injun got no respec' for who I is?\"\n\n\"I don't believe he knows who you really are, Wash,\" chuckled Jack,\nwhose wounded hand was now so much better that it did not keep him\nfrom handling his rifle in a way to make old Andy proud of his pupil's\nmarksmanship.\n\n\"Can dat be a posserbility?\" demanded Wash, vainly. \"Ain't dey nebber\nhearn tell ob me, d'yo s'pose, Massa Jack?\"\n\n\"I believe they are quite ignorant of who you are,\" returned Jack,\nwith gravity.\n\n\"But some ob 'em done seed me ober dar at Massa Roebach's camp. Yas,\nsah! I reckernize one o' dem Injuns--de short feller behin' dat tree\nclose up yere. Gollyation! he jest fired dat shot dat come purt nigh\nhittin' Buttsy.\"\n\n\"He's trying to kill that Shanghai, Wash,\" said Jack, wickedly. \"That's\nwhat he's trying to do.\"\n\n\"Dat settles it!\" ejaculated the colored man, mighty wroth at this\nthought. \"I ain't goin' ter stan' no sech doin's. Tryin' ter shoot\nButtsy; is he? I'll show him in jest erbout a minute dat nobody kin\nshoot at ma Shanghai wid imputation an' git erway wid it--no sah!\"\n\nThe boys had no idea that he would do so reckless a thing. Wash was\nnot ordinarily a courageous person. But he was \"riled all up\" now, and\nhe feared for the Shanghai's safety.\n\nUp he jumped, threw down his rifle, and agilely leaped the fortification\nin the direction of the short Indian who had attracted his anger. He\nstreaked it across the intervening space so quickly that the startled\nenemy did not even fire at him.\n\nBut Andy Sudds began firing his magazine rifle as fast as he could\nsight her and pull the trigger, and Roebach followed his example. This\nvolley drove all the Indians to cover and doubtless saved the strangely\nreckless negro's life.\n\nWash reached the cover of the Aleut accused by him of aiming directly\nto finish the Shanghai rooster, and before that startled aborigine\ncould escape, he was disarmed by the black man and dragged across the\nintervening space to the fort.\n\nWash was powerful and could easily do this, for the Indian was not a\nheavy fellow. But on the way one Indian had fired at the darkey and\nwounded the Aleut in the leg.\n\n\"Lemme tell yo',\" roared Wash, \"I ain't gwine to hab no off-color\ncritter like disher try ter combobberate ma Shanghai. Dat is ma final\nratification ob de pre-eminent fac's. Does you understand me?\"\n\n\"We most certainly do, Wash!\" declared Jack, when he could speak for\nlaughing. \"And we'll never call you a coward again.\"\n\n\"You have given us a hostage,\" said the professor. \"You have done well.\"\n\nWash strutted and preened himself over this praise until another bullet\nsang over his head. Then he dropped down flat on the ground and groaned:\n\n\"Golly! dat bullet said--jes' as plain as day--'Whar is dat coon?'\nD' youse 'speck dat it meant _me_?\"\n\nMeanwhile Phineas Roebach had taken the wounded Aleut in hand. He not\nonly extracted the bullet and bound up the wound, but he made the\nfellow explain the situation in Aleukan and tell why the Indians had\nattacked the white men. The natives believed implicitly that the white\nmen in the strange flying machine had brought the awful earthquakes\nand storms of ashes, and that now they were burning up the poor Indians\nfor a part of the day and freezing them the rest of the time.\n\nBelieving all the whites in the region leagued together they had at\nonce driven out the traders at Aleukan. This Indian did not know what\nhad become of the traders and their assistants. They had started on\ndog sleds toward the Polar Ocean.\n\nNo train had come in from Coldfoot for a month. Therefore it was plain\nthat the supplies Professor Henderson had expected to meet him here\nwould not now arrive. The pass through the Endicott Range was so high\nthat, so the party all believed, an attempt to cross the mountain range\nwould result in the death of those who attempted. There was no\natmosphere at the altitude of that pass.\n\nThere were no more shots fired after the Indian was brought in by\nWashington. The whites talked the situation over and finally the oil\nman made the Aleuts an offer through the captive. It was agreed that\nif the white men were allowed two sleds and two teams of good dogs,\nwith provisions for the dogs to last a week, they would instantly set\nout on the trail of the departed traders, thus removing their fatal\npresence from the vicinity of Aleukan.\n\nThis agreement was considered wise by all hands, for they felt the\nnecessity of joining if possible white men who were more familiar with\nthe territory than they were. In numbers there would be strength. If\nthere was to be a war on this new planet between the whites and the\nreds, it behooved our friends to join forces with their own kind as\nquickly as possible.\n\nThe captured Indian was made to accompany the train for two days and\nthen was freed. The dog teams swept the party over the frozen trail\nat good speed toward the Anakturuk River which empties into the\nColeville, which in turn reaches the Arctic Ocean at Nigatuck, in sight\nof the Thetis Islands.\n\nFood was very short. Game seemed to have fled from the valleys through\nwhich they passed. The cold at night (the only time they could travel)\nremained intense. And that flight toward the ocean shore--or what had\nonce been that shore--was a perilous journey indeed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nTHE HERD OF KADIAKS\n\n\nJack Darrow and Mark Sampson had never experienced so arduous a trip\nby dog sled as this. The party was really running a race with\nstarvation. The terrible frosts of each long night on this island in\nthe air had killed every species of vegetation the country wide, save\nthe very hardiest trees and shrubs. The country, which two weeks before\nhad been verdant as only a northern country can be verdant in late\nsummer, was now as black as though a fire had swept over it.\n\nEverywhere, too, lay the volcanic ashes that had fallen ere the new\nplanet had been shot from the earth by the volcanic eruption. It was\nindeed a devastated country through which the Alaskan dogs drew them.\n\nThey dared not drive the dogs more than twelve hours out of the long\nnight; but when the word was given to \"mush,\" and the train started,\nthe party kept up a good speed for those dozen hours.\n\nAndy Sudds and Phineas Roebach took the lead in this journey. They\nunderstood better how to handle the dogs and how to choose the trail.\nBut, indeed, the trail was pretty well marked for them by the white\ntraders who had gone before. Their camping sites were marked by a\nplenitude of discarded and empty food tins.\n\nThe party ahead, in whose pursuit the boys and their friends were,\nundoubtedly traveled just as fast as Jack and Mark. And they had a\nweek's start, according to the Indian who had not been allowed to\nreturn to his fellows until the whites were well along the trail to\nthe Anakturuk River.\n\nThe valley of the river, when they reached it, was a desert. There was\nlittle wonder that most of the game had fled. All herb-eating animals\nwould have died for want of forage.\n\n\"I am not sure,\" the professor said, gravely, during one of their\ncampfire talks, \"that physical life of any kind can long exist in this\nsmall planet. The vegetation is being rapidly destroyed. Soon the\nground will become like rock. The carnivorous beasts will live for a\nwhile on the more timid creatures, then they will fight among themselves\nuntil the last beast is destroyed.\n\n\"There were no great lakes in this Alaskan region when our present\nplanet was a part of the earth. We do not know how full the streams\nmay be of fish. There are few birds to be seen, that is sure. I fear\nthat before many years this will be either a dead and frozen island\nfloating in space, or it will be absorbed by some other body of the\nuniverse.\"\n\n\"You said, Professor,\" Jack observed, \"that its ultimate end would\neither be to fall into the sun, or collide with the earth.\"\n\n\"And that is my belief yet; but I have no means of knowing surely.\"\n\n\"I hope she bumps the world again!\" cried Jack. \"Maybe we can get off\nthen.\"\n\n\"It will do a lot of damage when it falls,\" said Andy Sudds,\nreflectively. \"Some folks up there in the earth will get hurt.\"\n\n\"Perhaps not,\" the professor said, hastily.\n\n\"How can it be otherwise?\" Mark demanded. \"This fragment of the world\nmust be enormously heavy. Cities--counties--whole states will be buried\nif we should fall into the earth.\"\n\n\"Not if we came down into one of the big oceans,\" said Professor\nHenderson. \"We would probably sink some vessels, and might overwhelm\nislands; but if this island in the air is as big as Australia it could\neasily fall into the Pacific and do no particular harm to any present\nexisting body of land--save through the great tidal waves that would\nresult from such a fall.\"\n\n\"It is an awful thing to think of,\" cried Mark. \"I don't see, no matter\nhow this awful affair ends, but that we are bound to be overwhelmed.\"\n\n\"We do not know that,\" declared the professor, with his wonted\ncheerfulness. \"Never say die. Our safety is in the hands of Providence.\nWe have not got to worry about that.\"\n\n\"Isn't he a wonder?\" whispered Jack to his chum. \"We ought to take\npattern by him. Our grumbling and anxiety is a shame.\"\n\nYet it was very difficult to remain cheerful under the circumstances\nas they then were. Their provisions, even for the dogs, were at a low\nebb. Not a shot at edible bird or beast had they obtained since leaving\nAleukan. And the torrid sun by day and the frost by night were most\ntrying.\n\n\"However,\" said Professor Henderson, \"I have kept a careful account\nof the fluctuations of temperature since the catastrophe, and I find\nthat the mercury does not descend into the bulb so far now as it did\nat first. We are circling the earth, as the earth circles the sun. At\npresent we are turning more toward the sun. It is coming summer. The\nsun will more and more heat this torn-away world. I do not believe\nthat vegetation will start, and I look for nothing but frost during\nthe hours of the sun's absence. But the cold night is not so intense\nas it was at first.\"\n\n\"It's quite cold enough, just the same,\" Phineas Roebach grunted. \"It\nwas summer a few days ago--the best summer this part of Alaska ever\nhas. And to jump right into cold weather--midwinter, as ye might say--is\nenough to kill us all.\"\n\nThe oil man simply ignored the professor's scientific explanations of\ntheir situation and the changes in their environment. He absolutely\nwould not believe that they were floating in the air above the earth's\nsurface.\n\nThe trail down the valley of the Anakturuk was fairly smooth and well\ndefined; when they struck the Coleville--a much wider stream--the shore\nwas very rugged, and the dogs could scarcely drag the sleds over some\nstretches of the route.\n\nThe traders who had gone before them were certainly having a hard time.\nOur friends traveled very slowly for two days, walking most of the\ntime. Then they found that the veil of ice that had formed on the wide\nstream since the region had become a torn-away world, would bear both\nmen and dogs; the sun merely made it spongy for a few hours each day,\nbut did not destroy the ice, which was now three or four inches thick.\n\nEach night when the sun set and the air cooled the water on the surface\nof this sheet of smooth ice congealed again, making a splendid course\nfor skating--had they only possessed the skates. But the sleds slipped\nmore easily over the ice and the dogs were saved for two or three days\nlonger. The brutes were almost starved, however, and one of them going\nlame, when they were released at a certain stopping place, the others\npitched upon their wounded comrade and like wolves tore the unfortunate\ndog to pieces before Roebach could beat them into submission.\n\nAndy Sudds chopped through the ice and set lines for fish; but the\ncatch was so small that the party could not spare more than the bones\nfor the dogs. Starvation faced them. Mark was miserably despondent,\nand Wash was so lugubrious all the time that he seldom exploded in his\nusual pyrotechnical displays of big words. His grain supply for the\nShanghai had completely run out, too, and the colored man divided his\nown poor rations with his pet.\n\n\"And the rooster's that lean he wouldn't be anything but skin and bone\nif we killed and cooked him,\" Jack wickedly proposed.\n\nWash looked upon his young friend in extreme horror.\n\n\"Eat Buttsy?\" he finally gasped. \"Why Massa Jack! I'd jest as lief eat\na baby--dat I would!\"\n\nBut the matter of eating was past the joking stage now. The dogs fell\non the ice and could not get up again. It was a mercy to put them out\nof their misery, and this is what Phineas Roebach and Andy did--shooting\neach faithful creature through the head and leaving the carcasses for\nthe wolves which had, all this time, followed the little party at a\nrespectful distance.\n\n\"If wolf meat was fit to eat we'd certainly live on the fat of the\nland,\" quoth the oil man.\n\n\"I wouldn't mind meeting a bear--savage as that other fellow was,\"\nsaid Andy Sudds.\n\nAnd before they were through with this adventure they saw all the bear\nmeat--and that very much alive--that the party ever wished to behold.\n\nFirst, however, came Mark's invention. They dragged the empty\nsleds--after the dogs were killed--for several miles and then went\ninto camp beside the stream, while the sun rose and warmed them most\nuncomfortably.\n\nRoebach suggested abandoning the sleds as they could carry the little\nstock of movables they now owned. But Andy was opposed to this as he\nfeared the professor might break down, in which event they would have\nto drag him.\n\n\"We must keep one of the sleds, at least,\" the old hunter insisted.\n\n\"I have a scheme,\" quoth Mark, suddenly. \"Why not use the sleds--both of\nthem?\"\n\n\"True enough--why not?\" scoffed Jack. \"Let's keep them to slide down\nhill on. Do you realize that the professor says we are still three\nhundred miles from Nigatuk and the mouth of the Coleville?\"\n\n\"That is the reason I suggest traveling by sled instead of dragging\nthem behind us,\" said Mark, unruffled. \"I've got an idea.\"\n\nJack stopped then. When Mark said he had an idea his chum knew it was\nprobably worth listening to, for Mark possessed an inventive mind.\n\n\"We will have to strap the robes and blankets on our shoulders if we\nabandon the sleds,\" Mark Sampson said, quietly. \"Let us utilize them\nto better advantage and save the sleds in addition.\"\n\n\"How?\" asked Phineas Roebach.\n\n\"Make sails of the robes and propel the sleds, riding on them, too,\"\ndeclared Mark. \"Such wind as there is is pretty steadily at our backs.\nWhy not?\"\n\n\"Why not, indeed?\" shouted Jack. \"Hurrah for Mark!\"\n\n\"A splendid thought, my boy,\" declared the professor.\n\nPoles were cut for masts and Andy rigged a stout one on each sled,\nwith cross-pieces, or spars, to hold the blankets spread as sails.\nAndy even rigged sweeps for rudders with which to steer these crude\nice-boats. They got off under a fair wind as soon as the river was\npassable again, and ran fifty miles straight away without stopping.\nThis was a great lift toward the end of their journey, and all plucked\nup courage. The Shanghai seemed to share the feeling of renewed hope,\nand began to crow again.\n\nThey were obliged to rest over the sunlit day, as before, for the ice\nbecame covered with a sheet of water an hour after sunrise, and they\nwere afraid the sled runners would cut through and let them all down\ninto the stream.\n\nHowever, they saw very well that--barring some unforeseen accident--they\nwould be able to reach the mouth of the river before the last of their\nscanty food supply ran out. All the way now they looked for signs of\nthe traders from Aleukan, who had started for the coast ahead of them.\nThese men, however, seemed to have left the rough path along the bank\nof the Coleville, and were either traveling on the ice ahead, or had\nstruck off into the wilderness.\n\nWhen they set sail for a second time the heavens, for the first time\nsince the final cataclysm that had shot them off into space, were\nbeginning to be overcast.\n\n\"There is so great an evaporation while the sun is shining that I am\nsurprised that we have not had snow before,\" the professor observed.\n\"These mists rising from the earth and the bodies of water would become\nheavy nightly rains in any other climate. Here they will result, now\nthat the atmosphere has become saturated with moisture, in heavy hail\nstorms and much snow. It is nothing more than I have looked forward\nto.\"\n\nThe remainder of the party were not so much interested in the natural\nphenomena as he, however; they looked forward mainly to reaching some\nsafe refuge--some place where there were supplies and the fellowship\nof other human beings.\n\nThe wind increased, but its keenness the party did not mind. They were\nonly glad that it remained favorable to their line of travel. They\nswept down the frozen river at a speed not slower than ten miles an\nhour.\n\nThe wolves had followed them on the ice, or along the edge of the\nriver, up to this time. They saw, indeed, a pack of the ugly creatures\non a wooded point ahead of them, at a distance of a couple of miles.\nBut before the sleds reached this point (which served to hide the icy\ntrack beyond) the wolves suddenly disappeared.\n\n\"Something has scared them fellers,\" Andy declared.\n\n\"The traders?\" suggested Jack, who traveled with the old hunter and\nMark on one sled, while Roebach, Wash and Professor Henderson sailed\non the other. \"Not hardly. Men wouldn't scare them critters so.\nSomething bigger and uglier than the wolves themselves, I reckon.\"\n\nTo prove how true Andy's guess was, Mark shouted the next moment:\n\n\"A bear--two of them! Three! See that crowd of bears, will you? No\nwonder the wolves skedaddled.\"\n\nSeveral of the huge bears, like the one they had had the fight with\non the glacier, appeared out of the woods and waddled on to the ice.\nThey had evidently sighted the sailing party, and they roared savagely\nand tried to head off the sleds. That they were wild with hunger, there\ncould be no doubt.\n\n\"I have heard the Indians say that, in bad seasons, the bears travel\nin packs like wolves, and will attack villages and tear the huts to\npieces to get at the inmates,\" Roebach said, from the other sledge.\n\n\"How fortunate that we are not afoot, then,\" Professor Henderson\nremarked.\n\nThe next moment the two sleds shot around the wooded point and the\nriver below lay before them. The bears were galloping after the party\nand shut off all way of escape to the rear.\n\n\"Oh, gollyation! Looker dat mess ob b'ars!\" shrieked Washington White.\n\nAnd there was a good reason for the black man's terror. Strung out\nacross the frozen river, as though they had been waiting for the coming\nof the exploring party, was a great herd of Kodiak bears--monsters of\nsuch horrid mien that more than Washington were terror-stricken by\ntheir appearance.\n\nThere were more than half a hundred of the savage creatures, little\nand big, and they met the appearance of the two sailing sledges with\na salvo of bloodthirsty growls.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\nTHE ABANDONED CITY\n\n\nIt was too late for our heroes and their friends to escape giving\nbattle to the bears. They could not steer the sleds clear of the\nmonsters, nor could they retreat. There were enough of the savage\nbeasts in the rear to make this last impossible.\n\n\"Come ahead!\" yelled Andy Sudds to Phineas Roebach, who guided the\nsecond sled. \"Don't stop.\"\n\nJack and Mark, with the old hunter, were on the first sled. They were\narmed with magazine rifles, and all seized these and prepared to fight\nfor their lives.\n\nAndy jammed the sweep with which he had been steering between his knee\nand the stake at the rear of the sledge, and put his gun to his\nshoulder.\n\n\"Shoot into the nearest bears, boys,\" he commanded. \"You both take\nthat big fellow right ahead. Get him down and I'll try to pepper those\non either side.\"\n\nBut the bears were all shuffling across the ice to get at the sailing\nsleds. They were fast bunching immediately in the front of their human\nenemies.\n\nJack and Mark obeyed the old hunter's order. They poured their fire\ninto the huge, shaggy beast that rose on its hind legs before the sled,\nand roaring, spread its huge paws abroad ready to seize it and its\nhuman burden.\n\nFortunately the wind had suddenly increased as the sleds rounded the\nwooded point. They were traveling faster. The lead pumped from the\nrifles of the two boys spattered against the breast of the great\ngrizzly, and stained its coat crimson in great blotches. But he stood,\nroaring in rage and pain, until the sled was right upon him.\n\nJack and Mark were forward of the sail, which was hoisted amidships.\nThe sled was surrounded by the savage beasts, and when it struck the\ntottering brute that alone stood in its direct path, there seemed to\nbe at least half a dozen of the bears on either side, rising on their\nhaunches in preparation to strike.\n\nThe collision almost overbalanced the sled. It certainly overbalanced\nthe bear, that had been hit by eight bullets from the rifles of Jack\nand Mark. And the huge body, lying right across the path of the sledge,\nhalted it.\n\n\"Swing your guns, boys!\" bawled Andy. \"Jack to the left, Mark to the\nright hand.\"\n\nOur heroes understood this command. They had been in tight places\nbefore with the old hunter, and now they partook of his enthusiasm.\n\nThe rifles spattered the lead among the nearest bears. Some of the\ncreatures fell back wounded. Some were merely enraged the more and,\nroaring their wrath, continued to advance.\n\nMeanwhile the old hunter had seized the steering sweep and endeavored\nto turn the sled aside. It had rebounded from the heavy carcass of the\nbear which had dropped upon the ice before it. Now Andy tried to work\nthe sled around this obstruction.\n\nThe second sled came; on, the professor relieving Roebach at the helm,\nand the oil man and Washington White pouring in volley after volley\nat the bears. The black man was a good shot and in the excitement of\nthe battle he forgot to be terrified. His bullets told as well as did\nthose from the rifle of Phineas Roebach.\n\nAnd fortunately the aged scientist brought this second sled safely\nthrough the line of bears. The first sled took the brunt of the battle.\nWhen that on which the professor sailed was a hundred yards beyond the\nherd of Kodiaks, he swerved it into the eye of the wind and so brought\nit to a halt without lowering the blanket that served as a sail. \"Come\non back and help' em!\" cried Phineas Roebach, leaping out upon the ice.\n\nHe started back toward the fight, firing as he went. Wash followed\nmore cautiously; and when one wounded beast started on a lumbering\ngallop in his direction, the colored man uttered a frightened shriek\nand legged it back to the professor.\n\nFortunately just about then the sled on which the boys and old Andy\nfought, came through the ruck of the struggle. Andy hacked with a\nhatchet the paws from the last Kodiak that tried to seize the sled,\nand the two boys continued to pour bullets into the howling, roaring\npack.\n\nThey took Phineas aboard the slowly moving sled and so reached the\nprofessor and Wash. Immediately that sled was put in motion and the\nparty traveled a full mile before they dared halt and take stock of\nthe damage done.\n\nThe bears had given up the pursuit. The ice for yards around had been\ncrimsoned by the blood of the huge beasts. They could count, even at\nthat distance, ten dead ones, and many would die of their wounds.\n\n\"And we didn't get even a slice of bear steak to pay us for it all!\"\ngroaned Jack.\n\n\"Wrong,\" returned Andy Sudds, proudly, and he held up the two paws he\nhad severed from the last brute. \"Those will give us all a taste of\nfricassee--and that same dish will be a welcome one, I declare.\"\n\nThey were not again molested by bears; but looking back when they had\ntraveled on some distance farther (the river being straight in this\nplace) they saw a huge pack of wolves gathering on the ice--more than\ntwo hundred at least of the savage brutes--and believed that a battle\nroyal was in progress between the remaining Kodiaks and the wolves.\n\n\"I hope they fight like the Kilkenny cats!\" declared Jack, with\nemphasis, \"And I hope the wolves will be kept so busy picking the bones\nof the slain that they will follow us no farther. They are like sharks\nat sea. I hate the beasts.\"\n\nThe country they passed as they slid down the river remained all but\ndeserted. The wind rose and wafted them faster and faster on their\nway; but it was plainly bringing them a storm, too.\n\nWhen the sun rose next time it was behind a thick mantle of mist.\nThunder rolled across the heavens and the lightning glared fitfully.\nThe heat had been unbearable before the storm, and the downpour of\nrain was terrific. The party was washed out of its encampment, and had\nit not been that Andy discovered shelter for them in a sort of cavern\nunder a huge boulder, they would all have been saturated.\n\nThe storm ended with a sharp fall of hail. Hailstones as big as duck\neggs fell, and the wind blew so that a portion of the river-ice was\nbroken up. When the storm ceased the sun was only an hour high and it\nwas already cold.\n\nThere being no dry wood now, the party suffered exceedingly before\nthey were able to set sail again on the re-frozen river. Quite six\nhours elapsed after the cessation of the hailstorm until the ice would\nagain bear.\n\nThe wind had then risen to a gale, and once under way, the sleds were\nborne on under closely reefed blankets. They traveled down the stream\nat a furious pace--at least twenty miles an hour--and arrived within\nsight of Nigatuk. But the appearance of this large and lively town (or\nso they had been led to expect it to be) was startling.\n\nNot a house was standing. Most of the ruins were blackened by a\ndevastating fire. And silence brooded over the place--a silence\nundisturbed by a human voice, the bark of a dog, or any other domestic\nsound.\n\nThe delta of the Coleville River hid the ocean beyond. All they could\nsee were the ice-bound forks of the stream. And no sign of life appeared\nin all that vast region to which they had flown for refuge and food.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\nTHE WHALE HUNT ASHORE\n\n\nThe depressing influence of this disappointment could not fail to be\nfelt by all--even by the old professor. They were without an ounce of\nfood and had no means of continuing their journey, even had they\npossessed an objective point.\n\nNigatuk was expected to have stores. Whalers as well as Government\nships often touched there. If this torn-away world was to float about\nthe parent globe for long, Nigatuk might have become a focussing point\nfor all the inhabitants of the new planet.\n\nBut the volcanic eruption, or the earthquakes, had evidently shaken\nNigatuk to bits, and fire had finished what remained after the\nearthquakes got through. As for the former inhabitants of the place,\nour party could not even imagine what had become of them.\n\nWhen they went through the wrecked town, however, they found many bones\npicked by the wolves. Some of the Nigatuk people had met their death\nand the savage beasts had reaped the harvest. They found no signs of\nthe company of traders whom they supposed they had followed from\nAleukan, far up in the foothills of the Endicott Range. Not a boat was\nfrozen into the ice at what had once been the wharves at the abandoned\ncity. That the remaining inhabitants had sailed away after the\ncatastrophe was at least possible.\n\n\"At least, the ocean must be out yonder somewhere,\" declared Phineas\nRoebach, pointing down the nearest estuary of the Coleville.\n\nProfessor Henderson did not verbally agree with this statement; yet\nhe made no objection to the suggestion that the party take up its\njourney again toward the sea.\n\nThe wind was fitful. They traveled unsteadily, too, tacking back and\nacross the estuary, because the breeze was so light, and no longer\nastern. Ten miles down the mouth of the stream they beheld an island\nwhere huge sheets of ice were piled one upon another, in an overhanging\njumble of ice-hummock, some fifty feet high. And along the edge of\nthis cliff was a herd of sea lions, that roared mournfully as the sleds\nadvanced.\n\n\"Thank goodness!\" exclaimed the professor. \"There is meat again.\"\n\nAndy and Roebach needed no urging to the attack. Nor did the boys.\nThey disembarked carefully and made a detour so as to get at the rear\nof the herd. The sea lion is not a very sagacious beast.\n\nJack and Mark were on either side of the old hunter and were moving\nupon the herd with considerable circumspection, and all had about come\nto a place where the rifles could be used effectively, when Jack Darrow\nspied something that brought a cry to his lips.\n\nFortunately both the hunter and Mr. Roebach fired the next instant and\ntwo of the sea lions were hit. The remainder of the herd slid over the\nice-cliff and flopped away at good speed toward a break in the ice\nthrough which they could get into the water.\n\nBut Jack began to dance and shout, and Mark was too surprised to even\nfire at the herd.\n\n\"What under the sun is the matter with you, chum?\" exclaimed Mark,\nwith some asperity. \"You're as bad as Washington White.\"\n\n\"Maybe I'm worse,\" bawled the cheerful Jack.\n\n\"You scared off them sea lions, boy,\" admonished Andy Sudds. \"We only\ngot two of them.\"\n\n\"Don't care if I did,\" replied Jack. \"See yonder!\"\n\nThe others followed the direction of his pointing arm with their gaze.\nOff beyond the headlands at the mouth of the river rose a column of\nthick black smoke. It was as big a smoke as though some great forge\nor factory was working overtime in that direction.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" cried Mark, re-echoing his chum's delight.\n\nThe entire party was delighted. Yet not knowing who the people were\nwho made the smoke, nor under what circumstances they would find them,\nthe dead sea lions were packed aboard the sleds before they continued\ntheir way down the river.\n\n\"That smoke lies a good way beyond the mouth of the river,\" said Phineas\nRoebach. \"I believe it is on the sea.\"\n\n\"A vessel afire?\" proposed Mark.\n\n\"It's a fire on a vessel,\" said the professor, suddenly. \"I believe\nthat is the smoke of the trying-out works on a whaler.\"\n\n\"You've hit it, Professor,\" agreed Andy Sudds. \"It's a whaler for sure.\nThere's more than _you_, Phineas, hunting for oil up in these regions.\"\n\n\"A whaling ship on this island in the air,\" murmured Jack. \"What will\nthey do with the whale oil? They will never get back to San Francisco\nagain.\"\n\n\"We do not know that,\" said the scientist, gravely.\n\nThe last few miles, during which they could not see beyond the high\nice-shod banks of the estuary, were traversed slowly enough. They all\ngrew anxious to know what the column of black smoke meant.\n\nFinally they came to the open mouth of this branch of the river. The\nsight they beheld almost stunned them.\n\nInstead of an ocean, rolling up in great surges upon the beach on\neither hand, they beheld a vast sink through which the partly ice-bound\nriver crawled as far as the eye could see. They knew that this was the\nold bed of the Arctic Ocean; but the waters of that cold sea had receded\nand left little but ice-bound pools here and there.\n\n\"Fo' de goodness gracious sake!\" cried Wash. \"Does yo' mean ter try\nter mak' me beliebe dat disher place is whar' de great an' omniverous\nocean once rolled? Dat de hugeous salt sea broke its breakers on dem\nice-bound shores? Git erlong, chile! Yo' is tryin' ter bamboozle me,\nsuah.\"\n\n\"That is where the Arctic Ocean rolled, all right,\" growled Phineas\nRoebach. \"I can swear to that. I have been here before. Something has\ncertainly happened to it.\"\n\n\"I declare!\" chuckled Jack Darrow, who could not miss the joke, despite\nthe seriousness of their situation. \"Somebody has removed the ocean\nwithout permission.\" Behind a great fortress of rock which had once\nbeen an island they saw the same column of smoke. But it was something\nnearer to them on the bed of the Arctic sea that more particularly\nattracted their attention.\n\n\"Look at that thing! That monster!\" cried Mark, pointing.\n\n\"And there is another!\" shouted Jack.\n\n\"Whales!\" yelled the excited Andy Sudds. \"Those are whales as sure as\nshooting--there's a school of them here.\"\n\nAnd they had no more than made this discovery when a party of men, all\ndressed in furs and some dragging great sleds behind them, came out\nfrom behind the pile of rocks which had certainly once been an island\nin the ocean.\n\nThese new-comers did not see our heroes and their friends, but they\napproached the whale stranded nearest to the rocks. This huge leviathan,\nlike all the others of the herd, was long since dead. The men attacked\nhim with blubber-saws and axes and began to cut him up in a most\nworkmanlike manner.\n\n\"A whaling ship, sure enough,\" declared Professor Henderson, who seemed\nthe least astonished by these manoeuvres. \"We will be among friends\nsoon. And we will hope that the ship--despite the fact that her crew\nhas come whaling ashore,--will have her keel in deep water.\" The party\nran their sleds ashore on the right bank of the river at its old mouth.\nThen they started at a round pace for the spot in the old bed of the\nocean where the crew of the whaler were cutting up their prize.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\nON THE WHALING BARK\n\n\nIt was several miles from the brink of what had once been the polar\nsea to the spot where the whalers were at work. Jack Darrow, Mark\nSampson, and their friends found it a difficult way to travel too.\n\nNaturally they had abandoned the sleds. The ice on the stream which\nflowed out of this mouth of the Coleville River was so broken that\nthey could no longer use it as a highway. The bottom of what had once\nbeen the ocean was only partly ice-covered. There were enormous rocks\nto climb over, or to find a path around. Reefs and ledges reared their\nheads fifty feet and more high. There were sinks, too, in the floor\nof the old ocean; but these were mostly covered with ice.\n\nThe Arctic Ocean must have receded at the time of the upheaval which\nhad flung this island into the air so rapidly that many of the sea's\ndenizens, beside the school of whales, could not escape.\n\nHere, in one big pool, lay frozen in the ice a monster white shark.\nIt had battered itself to death against the rocks in trying to escape.\nThrough yonder blow-hole in another pool there suddenly appeared an\nenormous bewhiskered head, with great tusks like the drooping mustache\nof a soldier.\n\n\"A walrus!\" exclaimed Jack, recognizing the creature.\n\n\"And yonder are seals playing in the open pool,\" said Mark.\n\n\"These pools, or lakes, are still of salt water,\" said the professor,\nthoughtfully. \"Ah! what would I not have given to have been on that\nheadland yonder at the moment the ocean went out.\"\n\n\"Not me! Not me!\" cried Phineas Roebach. \"I'd gone completely off my\nhead then, for fair--I know I would!\"\n\n\"Mr. Roebach is not quite sure now that he isn't suffering from some\nform of insanity,\" said Jack, chuckling.\n\n\"Den it suah is too bad dat we nebber kin fin' dat chrisomela\nbypunktater plant ter cure him wid,\" declared Washington White,\ndolefully.\n\n\"But, by the piper that played before Pharaoh!\" ejaculated Phineas\nRoebach, at last brought to a point where he _had_ to admit that\nno reasonable explanation would fit the conditions confronting them,\n\"tell me this: What has become of the Arctic Ocean?\" \"You can search\nme!\" drawled Jack. \"I can assure you, Mr. Roebach, that I haven't seen\nit. Have you got it, Mark?\"\n\n\"The question of what has become of this great sea which once washed\nthe shore we are now leaving,\" said Professor Henderson, seriously,\n\"is a remarkably interesting one. The ocean may have merely receded\nfor a few miles at the time of the volcanic eruption and earthquake\nwhich threw off this new planet.\"\n\nPhineas Roebach shook his head at this, but said nothing.\n\n\"It may be,\" pursued Mr. Henderson, \"that that part of our old world\nthat was shot into space did not include much of this Arctic sea. We\nmay find beyond here,\" pointing, as he spoke, ahead, \"instead of the\nreceded ocean, no ocean at all. We cannot believe that this island in\nthe air is spherical like our own old earth. It is a ragged form which\nwill show on what we may call the _under_ side the very convolutions and\nscars made by its breaking away from the old earth. Do you get my\nmeaning?\"\n\n\"Yo' suttenly is a most liquid speaker, Perfesser,\" declared Washington\nWhite. \"Yo' was sayin' dat w'en disher new planet broke off de earf,\nshe slopped over de whole Arctic Ocean.\"\n\n\"Perhaps that puts it quite as simply,\" said Professor Henderson,\nsmiling grimly. \"The ocean 'slopped over'. It was either left behind\nto partly fill the cavity left by the departure of this torn-away world\nwe are living on, or it has receded into the valleys and sinks upon\nthe other side of this small planet.\"\n\nPhineas Roebach threw up both hands and groaned.\n\n\"It's as clear as mud!\" he cried. \"I don't understand a thing about\nit.\"\n\nBut the old professor went on without heeding him, knowing that his\npupils, Jack and Mark, were deeply interested in the mystery of this\ntorn-away world, or island in the air.\n\n\"It is a moot question whether or not the weight of the water which\nlay in this vast sink, before the eruption, was not needed, and is not\nneeded right now, for the balancing of this tiny planet we are living\non. Nature adjusts herself to every change more quickly than human\nintelligence. How much of the crust of the earth, extending up into\nthe polar regions, was broken away from our old world, we do not know.\nBut that it is now perfectly balanced we can have no doubt--that balance\nis proved by the fact of the regularity of the recurrence of night and\nday.\"\n\nThese and many other observations Professor Henderson spoke as the\nparty continued its rugged advance over the more or less dry bottom\nof the ocean. In two hours the party was observed by the crew of the\nwhaler at work on the carcass of the great whale. The sailors signaled\nto them, and when the boys and their friends drew near, some of the\nwhalemen ran forward to welcome them.\n\n\"More refugees from inland, eh?\" exclaimed a rough but cordial seaman,\nwho proved to be the captain's harpooner and boat-steerer. \"We have\nsome traders from Aleukan already with us.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Professor Henderson, \"we have been looking for them. They\nhave arrived in safety, then?\"\n\n\"But nearly frozen,\" said the boat-steerer.\n\n\"And where are the people of Nigatuk?\"\n\n\"We believe all those not killed or burned in the first earthquake\nwere taken off by the United States revenue cutter _Bear_. She sailed\nfor Bering Sea some time before the final earthquake.\"\n\n\"And where is the ocean?\" demanded Phineas Roebach.\n\n\"It was sucked away in a great tidal wave and left the _Orion_ high and\ndry yonder,\" said the sailor.\n\nIt was evident that the sailors had no appreciation of the real\nhappening. They did not know that they were cut off from the old earth\nby thousands of miles of space. \"Your bark's name is _Orion_, then?\"\nqueried the professor.\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" said the boat-steerer. \"The _Orion_, out o' New\nBedford; the only whaler under sail in these seas, I reckon. Most o'\nthem that's after the ile is steam kettles,\" he added, thus\ndisrespectfully referring to the fleet of steam whalers from San\nFrancisco.\n\n\"But we got 'em all beat, I guarantee,\" he added, grinning. \"We was\nchasin' a school of big fellers when the sea sucked out and left us\nan' them high and dry. But the skipper says the sea will come back in\ngood time and mean-times we gits the ile.\"\n\nJust then the boat-steerer was sending off several sled loads of blubber\nto his ship, and Jack and Mark, with the professor and their companions,\naccompanied the cargo.\n\nThe _Orion_ was a fine big bark and was commanded by an old-fashioned\nYankee skipper of the type now almost extinct. He welcomed the travelers\naboard his ship most cordially, the ship itself all of a stench with the\ntrying blubber, and overshadowed by a huge cloud of black smoke, for the\nfires were fed with waste bits of blubber and fat.\n\nThe skipper and crew were literally \"making hay while the sun shone,\"\nfor there were more than twenty huge leviathans within a circuit of\nten miles from the bark, and they proposed to have every one of them\nbefore the flocks of seabirds, or the bears, should find and destroy\nthe stranded creatures.\n\n\"We'll fill every barrel and be ready to sail home with our hatches\nbattened down when the sea comes back,\" declared Captain Sproul.\n\n\"And you are quite sure the ocean will return and float your bark?\"\nqueried the scientist, patiently, for he saw that it was quite as\nuseless to explain what had happened to this hard-headed old sea-dogas\nit was to talk to Phineas Roebach.\n\n\"You can bet your last dollar it will come back, Mr. Henderson,\"\ndeclared Captain Sproul.\n\n\"Why do you think so?\" asked the professor.\n\n\"Why, the ocean always _has_ been here; ain't it?\"\n\n\"I expect so--within the memory of man.\"\n\n\"Then it will come back!\" cried the skipper of the _Orion_, as though\nthat were an unanswerable argument.\n\n\"But what do you call that up yonder?\" asked Professor Henderson,\npointing to the calm-faced earth rolling tranquilly through the heavens,\nwhile her satellite, the moon, likewise appeared.\n\n\"We certainly are blessed with moons,\" said Sproul, nodding. \"And\nmighty glad of it I be. As the day is so short now, and the sun is so\nhot, two moons to work by is a blessing indeed to us whalers.\"\n\n\"And you don't consider that new planet anything wonderful?\" Jack\nDarrow asked Captain Sproul.\n\n\"Not at all. We often see what they call sun dogs; don't we?\"\n\n\"I have seen such things,\" admitted the youth, while he and Mark smiled\nat the old skipper's simplicity.\n\n\"That double moon is like that, I reckon,\" said Sproul, and that ended\nthe discussion.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\nWHEN THE SEA ROLLED BACK\n\n\nThe boys were interested in this novel kind of whaling; but they were\nmore deeply interested in the possible outcome of the situation in\nwhich they, and their friends, and the fur-traders, and the bark's\ncrew, were all placed.\n\nThe tearing away of this piece of our planet, on which the boys and\ntheir companions now sailed, must end finally in some terrible\ncatastrophe. It would be catastrophe enough if the torn-away world\nnever returned to the earth, but sailed forever and ever, round and\nround its parent planet. Our heroes and their companions would then\nbe marooned without hope of rescue on a fragmentary planet in space,\nthe said planet doomed to become a mere lump of dead and frozen matter\nadrift in the universe.\n\nProfessor Henderson set up the powerful telescope that he had brought,\nwith his other instruments, all the way from the wrecked flying machine\nleft in the crevasse of the great glacier, and busied himself in filling\nhis notebooks with data relating to the movements of this new planet,\nand of the strange and remarkable incidents occurring each hour of\ntheir imprisonment on the island in the air.\n\nJack and Mark, however, found time to help the whalemen secure the oil\nfrom the carcasses of the stranded leviathans which surrounded the\n_Orion_. They, with old Andy and Phineas Roebach, began to go out\nwith the parties of blubber-hunters to guard them at their work. For\nnow great troops of polar bears appeared from the north, evidently\nmaking their way from the fields of ice that likewise had become\nstranded on the old sea bed; and these white bears were as savage and\nas hungry as were the Kodiak bears that infested the river.\n\nThe two chums, thus engaged, had an adventure one day that they were\nnever likely to forget. Seeing that there were several of the huge\nwalruses imprisoned in the lakes of salt water remaining in the ocean\nbed, Jack and Mark desired to kill one for its great tusks. They knew\nwhere there was one of the beasts--half as heavy as an elephant--and\nnot far from one of the last whales the crew of the _Orion_ were\ncutting up. The boys were guarding this special party of seamen at\ntheir work, but had seen no bears since sunset.\n\nThere was plenty of light, for both the earth-planet was shining on\nthem and her moon likewise, although the latter was now in her last\nquarter. Quite sure that the sailors would not be molested, Jack and\nMark crept away toward the pool where they had seen the walrus.\n\nThey soon found, however, that they were not alone. Washington White\nhad come over from the bark, and seeing what the boys were about he\nfollowed them.\n\n\"Is you suah 'nuff gwine ter try an' shoot dat hugeous wallingrust,\nan' pull his teef?\" he whispered. \"Yo' boys will git killed, some day,\nfoolin' wid sech critters.\"\n\n\"You'd better go back, then,\" said Mark, \"if you are afraid.\"\n\nBut the darkey wanted to see how the boys proposed to go about the\nwork of capturing the walrus. Jack had prepared a long and stout line\nwith a whale lance at one end and a sharp spike at the other. The boys\nvery well knew that the bullets from their rifles would make little\nimpression on the walrus. They had to go about his, capture in a\ndifferent way from shooting bears.\n\nThe salt water lake in which the walrus was trapped was perhaps a mile\nacross, and there were several blow-holes in it. The party had to lie\ndown behind a barrier of seaweed that the wind had tossed up in a great\nwindrow, and wait for the walrus to appear at one hole or another.\n\nWhen his fierce head came into view Jack and Mark, with their satellite,\nWashington, crept around to the rear of the creature, and then made\na swift but careful advance upon his position. They reached a spot\nupon the ice not more than ten yards from the blow-hole without\nattracting the attention of the walrus.\n\nInstantly Jack motioned his chum to stand ready to drive the steel\nspur at the end of the line into the ice to hold the beast, while he\nwent forward with the harpoon. Right at the edge of the broken ice,\nwithin ten feet of the monster, Jack Darrow stood a moment with the\nweapon poised.\n\nHe swung back his body and arm, aimed true for the spot behind the\nshoulders of the walrus, and then drove the iron home with all his\nstrength.\n\nThe harpoon sank deep, and a mighty roar burst from the lips of the\nstricken beast. Mark drove down the steel peg, stamping on it to fix\nit securely in the ice. The walrus threw his huge body around and came\nhalf out of the water upon the ice to reach his tormentor. But Jack\nwas ready for this move, and he sprang back, out of danger, and picked\nup his rifle.\n\nThe ice of course broke under the walrus for yards around. His fierce\nlittle eyes seemed to take in every move of his tormentors. He saw\nboth boys (for Mark, too, had reached his gun) spreading out on either\nhand to get in fatal shots if they could. Meanwhile Washington White\nstood on the line close to the peg in the ice so that the beast could\nnot jerk free.\n\n\"Take him in the eye, if you can, Mark!\" shouted Jack. \"The cap of\nblubber he wears will act like a cushion if we shoot him in the head.\"\n\nBut before either of them could obtain a satisfactory mark, the beast\nsank from sight. He had broken the ice for some yards toward the place\nwhere the end of the line was fastened, and he now had plenty of slack.\nThe boys waited expectantly for his reappearance, while Wash stood,\nopen-mouthed and eyes a-roll.\n\nSuddenly the black man executed a most astounding acrobatic feat. From\nthat standing posture he executed in the twinkling of an eye a swift\nback somersault, at least twenty feet from the ice!\n\n\"Oh, gollyation! I'se a goner!\" he yelped, as he described his\nsurprising parabola through the air.\n\nThe ice where Wash had stood, and where the steel peg had been driven\nin, was crushed to fragments as the huge head and shoulders of the\nwounded walrus came up from the depths. The creature had marked the\nnegro's position exactly, and had burst through the ice at the right\nspot. The wonderful lightness of all matter on this torn-away world,\nhowever, saved the darkey's life. The blow threw Wash so far away that\nthe walrus could not immediately get at him.\n\nBut he evidently laid his trouble entirely to the black man, and he\nthrew himself forward along the ice, smashing it to bits, and gnashing\nat it with his tusks. In half a minute he would have been on the spot\nwhere the negro lay had not the boys run in swiftly and pumped a dozen\nbullets into his eyes and down his open mouth. By good luck more than\ngood management they killed the beast.\n\n\"See wot yo' done done!\" wailed Washington White, rising gingerly and\nwith a hand upon the small of his back. \"Yo' come near ter spilein'\nPerfesser Henderson's most impo'tant assistant. How do you 'speck de\nperfesser c'd git erlong widout me?\"\n\nThis was certainly an unanswerable question, and the boys admitted it.\nThey were sorry Wash had been so badly frightened, but they were\ndelighted at the possession of the tusks of the walrus. The whalers\nsecured the body, too, and made a very good quality of oil out of\nthe blubber.\n\nIn hunting adventures, and in the labor of trying-out the whale blubber,\nseveral weeks passed. The marooned scientist and his friends, with the\ncrew of the whale ship, experienced some bad weather during this time.\nFor three entire days a terrible snowstorm raged--a blizzard that\ndrifted the snow about the _Orion_ (which had chanced, when she was\nstranded, to settle on a perfectly even keel) until one could walk\nover her rail out upon the bottom of the sea.\n\nBut when this storm passed over the sun came out and shone as tropically\nas ever. The snow melted very rapidly and the old sea bed was soon\nawash. The beasts and fish still alive in the sinks were enabled to\nreach the streams running out of the various mouths of the Coleville,\nand these creatures took to deep water.\n\n\"By Jo!\" ejaculated Captain Sproul, \"give us a leetle more water and\nwe'd sail the old _Orion_ after them, and reach the open sea again.\"\n\nHe had every belief that the ocean would return to its former bed, and\nhis crew believed it, too. But Professor Henderson and the boys\nseriously discussed making some move from this locality.\n\nIt was plain that there was still plenty of game 'along the shore of\nthe old ocean, and they had about made up their mind to follow the\nedge of the shore toward Bering Sea and if possible find the revenue\ncutter _Bear_, when another storm broke over them. No snow fell\nthis time. There was almost continual thunder and a downpour of rain\nand hail that was sufficient to smother anybody that ventured out upon\nthe deck of the _Orion_. The new planet seemed to be in the throes\nof another eruption, too.\n\nLightning lit the waste about them with intermittent flashes. They had\nlost sight entirely of the old earth, of the moon, and of the sun. It\nseemed to Jack and Mark as though this tiny island in the air must be\nflying through space again, buffeted by every element.\n\nThe wind wailed and screamed about the whaleship. There were more than\nsixty souls aboard and they crouched in the cabin and in the forecastle\nand knew not what to make of such a foray of the elements. At one\nmoment the rain flooded down upon the decks as though a cloud had burst\ndirectly above them; then great hailstones fell, drumming on the planks\nlike musket balls.\n\nThe calmest person among them all was Professor Henderson. Captain\nSproul had given the aged scientist the use of the small chart-room.\nThere he had set up certain of his instruments, and he hovered over\nthese most of his waking hours, making innumerable calculations from\ntime to time. During the awful turmoil of the elements he watched his\ninstruments without sleep. The boys remained with him most of the time,\nfor they realized that some catastrophe was threatening which the\nscientist feared but did not wish to explain at once.\n\nSuddenly Captain Sproul burst into the chart-room and gasped:\n\n\"Can you tell me the meaning of this, Mr. Henderson? You're a scientific\nsharp and know a whole lot of things. My cook just went to the galley\ndoor to throw out a pot of slops and something--some mysterious\nforce--snatched the heavy iron pot out of his hand and it went sailing\noff over the ship's rail. Can you explain that?\"\n\n\"Wasn't it the wind snatched it away?\" asked Jack Darrow, before the\nprofessor was ready to answer.\n\n\"Don't seem to be no wind blowing just at present,\" said Captain Sproul.\n\n\"Wait!\" commanded the professor. \"Order every companionway and hatch\nclosed. Do not allow a man to go on deck, nor to open a deadlight. We\nmust exist upon the air that remains in the vessel for the present.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" gasped the skipper.\n\n\"There is no air outside!\" declared Professor Henderson, solemnly. \"We\nare flying through space where no atmosphere exists. The iron pot\nmerely remained poised in space--our planet, far, far, heavier, is\nfalling through this awful void.\"\n\n\"What sort o' stuff are you talkin'?\" demanded Captain Sproul, growing\npositively white beneath his tan.\n\n\"We began to fall several minutes ago,\" said the professor, pointing\nto the indicator of one of the delicate instruments before him on the\nchart table. \"The balance of attraction between the earth and the sun\nhas become disturbed and we are plunging--\"\n\n\"Into the sun?\" shrieked Mark Sampson, springing to his feet.\n\n\"No! no! Toward the earth! Toward the earth!\" reiterated Professor\nHenderson. \"Her attraction has proved the greater. We are falling with\nfrightful velocity toward the sphere from which we were blown off into\nspace so many weeks ago.\"\n\n\"I reckon I'm crazy,\" groaned Captain Sproul \"I hear you folks talkin',\nbut I don't understand a thunderin' word you say.\"\n\n\"You can feel that the air in here is vitiated; can't you?\" demanded\nProfessor Henderson.\n\nThe boys had already felt that it was more difficult to breathe. They\nheard cries all over the ship. Washington White burst into the room,\ncrying: \"Oh, lawsy-massy me, Perfesser! We is done bein' smothercated.\nDe breaf am a-leabin' our bodies fo' suah.\"\n\nThe negro fell in a swoon, overturning the table and sending the\nprofessor's instruments crashing to the floor. The others, struggling\nfor breath, likewise sank beside Wash. The lights all over the ship\nwere suddenly snuffed out. Every soul aboard lost consciousness as,\nrushing at unreckoned speed through the universe, the torn-away world\ndescended toward its parent planet.\n\nHow long they were unconscious none of the survivors ever learned.\nWhen they _did_ finally struggle to sense again, it was with the sound\nof the rushing of mighty waters in their ears.\n\nThe _Orion_ was afloat! She was being tossed upon the bosom of a\nwind-lashed ocean, and a hurricane, the like of which the two boys\nhad never experienced before, was at its height.\n\nCaptain Sproul rose to his feet, panting for breath, but with his\nsenses all alert. He shouted:\n\n\"The sea has rolled back again! What did I tell you? Up and at it, my\nbully boys! Get a sail upon her so's we can have steering way. Every\nile barrel is full and we're homeward bound!\"\n\nThe hatches were opened and they rushed on deck. It was so black that\nthey could see nothing but the storm-tossed waves--not a sign of land.\nBut it was plain, too, that they were no longer on the lee shore. They\nhad plenty of sea room to work the ship and the brave sailors went\nabout their usual tasks with cheerfulness.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\nAN ENDURING MONUMENT--CONCLUSION\n\n\nBut Professor Henderson and the boys, as well as Andy Sudds and\nWashington, gathered in the chart room. The aged scientist was confident\nthat during their period of unconsciousness the fragment of the earth\nthat had once been shot off into space, had returned to its parent\nglobe, and he spoke cheerfully of their probable escape.\n\n\"But have we descended into the very place we left?\" demanded Mark.\n\n\"Scarcely probable,\" returned the professor.\n\n\"Nevertheless the ocean has returned to this spot,\" declared Jack.\n\n\"There is water here, yes,\" admitted the professor. \"We are afloat, that\nis true.\"\n\n\"And is it not the Arctic Ocean?\"\n\n\"Later I will tell you. They say there is no land in sight. I believe\nthe bulk of the land which was shot off by the volcanic eruption has\nnow sunk in this sea. What sea it is we can tell soon.\"\n\n\"When can we see the sun and take an observation?\" queried Mark.\n\"Perhaps finding the temperature of this ocean which surrounds us will\ntell us something. However, we must have patience until this bitter\nstorm is past.\"\n\nAnd this did call for patience, for the hurricane continued for fully\na week. Meanwhile the Orion ran on under almost bare poles, and in a\nnorthwesterly direction. This course, Captain Sproul believed, would\nbring them to Bering Sea, and their homeward route.\n\nBut a vast and amazing discovery awaited the hardy navigator of the\nwhaling bark when the wind finally died down, the clouds were swept\naway, and the sun again appeared. Professor Henderson appeared on deck,\ntoo, and calculated their position side by side with Captain Sproul.\nThe latter's amazement was unbounded. His calculations, no matter how\nhe worked them, made the position of the _Orion_ 148 degrees west of\nGreenwich and 49 degrees north.\n\nIn other words, he was far, far south of the Alaskan Peninsula. During\nthis awful storm he had traversed (or so he was bound to believe) a\nlong stretch of the Arctic Ocean, Bering Sea and Strait, had passed\nthe Aleutian Islands, and was now more than a thousand miles south of\nthe position of the _Orion_ when she first became stranded.\n\nThe professor endeavored to explain to him again what had really\nhappened--that the fragment of the earth on which they had been marooned\nhad plunged into the old earth again, landing by great good fortune\nin the empty sea between North America and Asia--in the North Pacific.\n\nSuch an explanation seemed utterly ridiculous to Captain Sproul, to\nhis seamen, and even to Phineas Roebach. They were convinced that\nProfessor Henderson was in his dotage. They would rather believe that\nthe _Orion_, sailing on pretty nearly a straight course according\nto the compass, had traversed this enormous distance during the\nhurricane.\n\nThe professor and his young friends, however, had studied too deeply\nthe mystery of this astounding affair to be mistaken. All the phenomena\nof the experience had been noted by Professor Henderson. He had the\nmaterial of a most remarkable work in his notebooks, and that volume\nwill soon appear to delight the scientific world.\n\nMeanwhile the _Orion_ changed her course and ran for San Francisco\nto re-provision. She had a very valuable cargo of oil which she would\nlater take around the Horn to her home port, New Bedford.\n\nAt San Francisco, however, Professor Henderson, Jack and Mark, with\nAndy and Wash and Phineas Roebach, left the ship. Roebach was to report\nto his oil company and probably return to Alaska to continue his search\nfor petroleum. Our friends started overland for home, stopping off at\nthe city where Dr. Artemus Todd resided to explain to that savant the\nreason for their inability to secure a single specimen of the\n_Chrysothele-Byzantium_, which herb the doctor was so confident\nwould be of incalculable value in treating patients suffering from\naphasia, amnesia, and kindred troubles.\n\nPerhaps the disappointed doctor was not entirely sure that his friend,\nProfessor Henderson, and his comrades, had gone through the strange\nexperience which they recounted. But a few weeks later several vessels\nreported sighting a new island in the North Pacific, south of the\nAlaskan Peninsula. On this island men who landed discovered a colony\nof Kodiak bears, some Arctic foxes, and the remains of vegetation which\nhad never before been found south of the Arctic Circle.\n\nThis discovery created vast talk among the geographers and scientists.\nAn exploring party was sent out by the Smithsonian Institution to\nexamine the new island. It was pronounced of volcanic origin, yet the\nformation of it was not of recent time. There was on this island (which\ncontained several square miles) the remains of a glacier, and in the\nice the party discovered the wreck of a wonderful flying machine, which\nhad evidently been built within a few months.\n\nOf course, this was the _Snowbird_, the aeroplane which our friends\nhad been obliged to abandon. But by that time Jack and Mark had built\nanother flying machine on the same lines as the one which they had\nlost in the crevasse of the glacier.\n\nThe professor proceeded to explain and prove all this in his book; but\nthere will always be certain doubters. Washington White, however, was\nmore disturbed than any of the party over the fact that everybody would\nnot accept as true the scientist's account of their wonderful voyage\non a torn-away world.\n\n\"De stupendous and unprecedented gall some folks has is suttenly beyond\ncomparination!\" exploded Wash. \"Dere is folks dat ain't nebber been\nto Bawston, eben, dat dares say dat we didn't go ter Alaska in a flyin'\nmasheen, an' den fly away wid a piece ob dat kentry inter de\ncimcum-ambient air--droppin' back on de same w'en we'd got t'roo wid\nit, an' landin' right outside de harbor of San Francisco. Dey won't\nbelieb it at all, not eben w'en I proves it to 'em.\"\n\n\"And how do you prove it to your friends, Wash?\" queried Jack Darrow.\n\n\"By Buttsy,\" declared the darkey, gravely.\n\n\"By the Shanghai?\"\n\n\"Yes, sah. By Christopher Columbus Amerigo Vespucci George Washington\nAbraham Lincoln Ulysses Grant Garibaldi Thomas Edison Guglielmo Marconi\nButts.\"\n\n\"And how do you prove it by Christopher Columbus And-so-forth?\" demanded\nthe chums, in chorus.\n\n\"Why,\" said Wash, rolling his eyes, \"I done tooked dat rooster wid me\nin all ma trabels; didn't I?\"\n\n\"You most certainly did,\" admitted Mark.\n\n\"And a big nuisance he was,\" added Jack.\n\nWash loftily overlooked this remark. He said, confidently:\n\n\"And I brought Buttsy back ergin; didn't I?\"\n\n\"You did. He's getting fat and sassy right now out in his coop behind\nthe bungalow.\"\n\n\"Well den!\" cried Wash. \"I done took him wid me, an' I done brought\nhim back. Wot furder elimination ob de fac's does dem folks want? Don't\nButtsy crowin' away dar prove it?\"\n\nAnd Washington White walked off with his head held very high as though\nhe had made a perfectly unanswerable statement of the case.\n\nAnd here we will say good bye to our friends, who had so many thrilling\nadventures while drifting through space On a Torn-Away World.\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of On a Torn-Away World, by Roy Rockwood\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ON A TORN-AWAY WORLD ***\n\n***** This file should be named 6468.txt or 6468.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/6/4/6/6468/\n\nProduced by Mary Wampler, Juliet Sutherland, Charles\nAldarondo, Charles Franks and the Online Distributed\nProofreading Team.\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
