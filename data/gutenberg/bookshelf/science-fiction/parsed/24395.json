Schmitz\n\nIllustrated by Brotman\n\n\nGefty Rammer came along the narrow passages between the _Silver Queen's_\ncontrol compartment and the staterooms, trying to exchange the haggard\nlook on his face for one of competent self-assurance. There was nothing\nto gain by letting his two passengers suspect that during the past few\nminutes their pilot, the owner of Rammer Spacelines, had been a bare\nstep away from plain and fancy gibbering.\n\nHe opened the door to Mr. Maulbow's stateroom and went inside. Mr.\nMaulbow, face very pale, eyes closed, lay on his back on the couch,\nstill unconscious. He'd been knocked out when some unknown forces\nsuddenly started batting the _Silver Queen's_ turnip-shape around as the\n_Queen_ had never been batted before in her eighteen years of\nspacefaring. Kerim Ruse, Maulbow's secretary, knelt beside her employer,\nchecking his pulse. She looked anxiously up at Gefty.\n\n\"What did you find out?\" she asked in a voice that was not very steady.\n\nGefty shrugged. \"Nothing definite as yet. The ship hasn't been\ndamaged--she's a tough tub. That's one good point. Otherwise ... well, I\nclimbed into a suit and took a look out the escape hatch. And I saw the\nsame thing there that the screens show. Whatever that is.\"\n\n\"You've no idea then of what's happened to us, or where we are?\" Miss\nRuse persisted. She was a rather small girl with large, beautiful gray\neyes and thick blue-black hair. At the moment, she was barefoot and in a\nsleeping outfit which consisted of something soft wrapped around her\ntop, soft and floppy trousers below. The black hair was tousled and she\nlooked around fifteen. She'd been asleep in her stateroom when something\nsmacked the _Queen_, and she was sensible enough then not to climb out\nof the bunk's safety field until the ship finally stopped shuddering and\nbucking about. That made her the only one of the three persons aboard\nwho had collected no bruises. She was scared, of course, but taking the\nsituation very well.\n\nGefty said carefully, \"There're a number of possibilities. It's obvious\nthat the _Queen_ has been knocked out of normspace, and it may take some\ntime to find out how to get her back there. But the main thing is that\nthe ship's intact. So far, it doesn't look too bad.\"\n\nMiss Ruse seemed somewhat reassured. Gefty could hardly have said the\nsame for himself. He was a qualified normspace and subspace pilot. He\nhad put in a hitch with the Federation Navy, and for the past eight\nyears he'd been ferrying his own two ships about the Hub and not\ninfrequently beyond the Federation's space territories, but he had never\nheard of a situation like this. What he saw in the viewscreens when the\nship steadied enough to let him pick himself off the instrument room\nfloor, and again, a few minutes later and with much more immediacy, from\nthe escape hatch, made no sense--seemed simply to have no meaning. The\npressure meters said there was a vacuum outside the _Queen's_ skin.\nThat vacuum was dark, even pitch-black but here and there came\nmomentary suggestions of vague light and color. Occasional pinpricks of\nbrightness showed and were gone. And there had been one startling\nphenomenon like a distant, giant explosion, a sudden pallid glare in the\ndark, which appeared far ahead of the _Queen_ and, for the instant it\nremained in sight, seemed to be rushing directly towards them. It had\ngiven Gefty the feeling that the ship itself was plowing at high speed\nthrough this eerie medium. But he had cut the _Queen's_ drives to the\nmerest idling pulse as soon as he staggered back to the control console\nand got his first look at the screens, so it must have been the light\nthat had moved.\n\nBut such details were best not discussed with a passenger. Kerim Ruse\nwould be arriving at enough disquieting speculations on her own; the\nless he told her, the better. There was the matter of the ship's\nlocation instruments. The only set Gefty had been able to obtain any\nreading on were the direction indicators. And what they appeared to\nindicate was that the _Silver Queen_ was turning on a new heading\nsomething like twenty times a second.\n\nGefty asked, \"Has Mr. Maulbow shown any signs of waking up?\"\n\nKerim shook her head. \"His breathing and pulse seem all right, and that\nbump on his head doesn't look really bad, but he hasn't moved at all.\nCan you think of anything else we might do for him, Gefty?\"\n\n\"Not at the moment,\" Gefty said. \"He hasn't broken any bones. We'll see\nhow he feels when he comes out of it.\" He was wondering about Mr.\nMaulbow and the fact that this charter had showed some unusual features\nfrom the beginning.\n\nKerim was a friendly sort of girl; they'd got to calling each other by\ntheir first names within a day or two after the trip started. But after\nthat, she seemed to be avoiding him; and Gefty guessed that Maulbow had\nspoken to her, probably to make sure that Kerim didn't let any of her\nemployer's secrets slip out.\n\nMaulbow himself was as aloof and taciturn a client as Rammer Spacelines\never had picked up. A lean, blond character of indeterminate age, with\npale eyes, hard mouth. Why he had selected a bulky semifreighter like\nthe _Queen_ for a mineralogical survey jaunt to a lifeless little sun\nsystem far beyond the outposts of civilization was a point he didn't\ndiscuss. Gefty, needing the charter money, had restrained his curiosity.\nIf Maulbow wanted only a pilot and preferred to do all the rest of the\nwork himself, that was certainly Maulbow's affair. And if he happened to\nbe up to something illegal--though it was difficult to imagine\nwhat--Customs would nail him when they got back to the Hub.\n\nBut those facts looked a little different now.\n\n       *       *       *\n\nGefty scratched his chin, inquired, \"Do you happen to know where Mr.\nMaulbow keeps the keys to the storage vault?\"\n\nKerim looked startled. \"Why, no! I couldn't permit you to take the keys\nanyway while he ... while he's unconscious! You know that.\"\n\nGefty grunted. \"Any idea of what he has locked up in the vault?\"\n\n\"You shouldn't ask me--\" Her eyes widened. \"Why, that couldn't possibly\nhave anything to do with what's happened!\"\n\nHe might, Gefty thought, have reassured her a little too much. He said,\n\"I wouldn't know. But I don't want to just sit here and wonder about it\nuntil Maulbow wakes up. Until we're back in normspace, we'd better not\nmiss any bets. Because one thing's sure--if this has happened to anybody\nelse, they didn't turn up again to report it. You see?\"\n\nKerim apparently did. She went pale, then said hesitantly, \"Well ... the\nsealed cases Mr. Maulbow brought out from the Hub with him had some very\nexpensive instruments in them. That's all I know. He's always trusted me\nnot to pry into his business any more than my secretarial duties\nrequired, and of course I haven't.\"\n\n\"You don't know then what it was he brought up from that moon a few\nhours ago--those two big cases he stowed away in the vault?\"\n\n\"No, I don't, Gefty. You see, he hasn't told me what the purpose of this\ntrip is. I only know that it's a matter of great importance to him.\"\nKerim paused, added, \"From the careful manner Mr. Maulbow handled the\ncases with the cranes, I had the impression that whatever was inside\nthem must be quite heavy.\"\n\n\"I noticed that,\" Gefty said. It wasn't much help. \"Well, I'll tell\n_you_ something now,\" he went on. \"I let your boss keep both sets of\nkeys to the storage vault because he insisted on it when he signed the\ncharter. What I didn't tell him was that I could make up a duplicate set\nany time in around half an hour.\"\n\n\"Oh! Have you--?\"\n\n\"Not yet. But I intend to take a look at what Mr. Maulbow's got in that\nvault now, with or without his consent. You'd better run along and get\ndressed while I take him up to the instrument room.\"\n\n\"Why move him?\" Kerim asked.\n\n\"The instrument room's got an overall safety field. I've turned it on\nnow, and if something starts banging us around again, the room will be\nthe safest place on the ship. I'll bring his personal luggage up too,\nand you can start looking through it for the keys. You may find them\nbefore I get a new set made. Or he may wake up and tell us where they\nare.\"\n\nKerim Ruse gave her employer a dubious glance, then nodded, said, \"I\nimagine you're right, Gefty,\" and pattered hurriedly out of the\nstateroom. A few minutes later, she arrived, fully dressed, in the\ninstrument room. Gefty looked around from the table-shelf where he had\nlaid out his tools, and said, \"He hasn't stirred. His suitcases are over\nthere. I've unlocked them.\"\n\nKerim gazed at what showed in the screens about the control console and\nshivered slightly. She said, \"I was thinking, Gefty ... isn't there\nsomething they call Space Three?\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Sure. Pseudospace. But that isn't where we are. There're some\nspecial-built Navy tubs that can operate in that stuff if they don't\nstay too long. A ship like the _Queen_ ... well, you and I and\neverything else in here would be frozen solid by now if we'd got sucked\nsomehow into Space Three.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Kerim said uncomfortably. Gefty heard her move over to the\nsuitcases. After a moment, she asked, \"What do the vault keys look\nlike?\"\n\n\"You can't miss them if he's just thrown them in there. They're over six\ninches long. What kind of a guy is this Maulbow? A scientist?\"\n\n\"I couldn't say, Gefty. He's never referred to himself as a scientist.\nI've had this job a year and a half. Mr. Maulbow is a very considerate\nemployer ... one of the nicest men I've known, really. But it was simply\nunderstood that I should ask no questions about the business beyond what\nI actually needed to know for my work.\"\n\n\"What's the business called?\"\n\n\"Maulbow Engineering.\"\n\n\"Big help,\" Gefty observed, somewhat sourly. \"Those instruments he\nbrought along ... he build those himself?\"\n\n\"No, but I think he designed some of them--probably most of them. The\ncompanies he had doing the actual work appeared to have a terrible time\ngetting everything exactly the way Mr. Maulbow wanted it--There's\nnothing that looks like a set of keys in those first two suitcases,\nGefty.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Gefty said, \"if you don't find them in the others, you might\nstart thumping around to see if he's got secret compartments in his\nluggage somewhere.\"\n\n\"I do wish,\" Kerim Ruse said uneasily, \"that Mr. Maulbow would regain\nconsciousness. It seems so ... so underhanded to be doing these things\nbehind his back!\"\n\nGefty grunted noncommittally. He wasn't at all certain by now that he\nwanted his secretive client to wake up before he'd checked on the\ncontents of the _Queen's_ storage vault.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFifteen minutes later, Gefty Rammer was climbing down to the storage\ndeck in the _Queen's_ broad stern, the newly fashioned set of vault keys\nclanking heavily in his coat pocket. Kerim had remained with her\nemployer who was getting back his color but still hadn't opened his\neyes. She hadn't found the original keys. Gefty wasn't sure she'd tried\ntoo hard, though she seemed to realize the seriousness of the situation\nnow. But her loyalty to Mr. Maulbow could make no further difference,\nand she probably felt more comfortable for it.\n\nLights went on automatically in the wide passage leading from the cargo\nlock to the vault as Gefty turned into it. His steps echoed between the\nsteel bulkheads on either side. He paused a moment before the big\ncircular vault doors, listening to the purr of the _Queen's_ idling\nengines in the next compartment. The familiar sound was somehow\nreassuring. He inserted the first key, turned it over twice, drew it out\nagain and pressed one of the buttons in the control panel beside the\ndoor. The heavy slab of steel moved sideways with a soft, hissing sound,\nvanished into the wall. Gefty slid the other key into the lock of the\ninner door. A few seconds later, the vault entrance lay open before him.\n\nHe stood still again, wrinkling his nose. The area ahead was only dimly\nilluminated--the shaking-up the _Queen_ had undergone had disturbed the\nlighting system here. And what was that odor? Rather sharp, unpleasant;\nit might have been spilled ammonia. Gefty stepped through the door into\nthe wide, short entrance passage beyond it, turned to the right and\npeered about in the semidarkness of the vault.\n\nTwo great steel cases--the ones Maulbow had taken down to an airless\nmoon surface, loaded up with something and brought back to the\n_Queen_--were jammed awkwardly into a corner, in a manner which\nsuggested they'd slid into it when the ship was being knocked around.\nOne of them was open and appeared to be empty. Gefty wasn't sure of the\nother. In the dimness beside them lay the loose coils of some very\nthick, dark cable--And standing near the center of the floor was a thing\nthat at once riveted his attention on it completely. He sucked his\nbreath in softly, feeling chilled.\n\nHe realized he hadn't really believed his own hunch. But, of course, if\nit hadn't been an unheard-of outside force that plucked the _Queen_ out\nof normspace and threw her into this elsewhere, then it must be\nsomething Maulbow had put on board. And that something had to be a\nmachine of some kind--\n\nIt was.\n\nAbout it he could make out a thin gleaming of wires--a jury-rigged\nsafety field. Within the flimsy-looking protective cage was a double\nbank of instruments, some of them alive with the flicker and glow of\nlights. Those must be the very expensive and difficult-to-build items\nMaulbow had brought out from the Hub. Beside them stood the machine,\nsquat and ponderous. In the vague light, it looked misshaped and\ndiscolored. A piece of equipment that had taken a bad beating of some\nkind. But it was functioning. As he stared, intermittent bursts of\nclicking noises rose from it, like the staccato of irregular gunfire.\n\nFor a moment, questions raced in disorder through his mind. What was it?\nWhy had it been on that moon? Part of another ship, wrecked now ... a\nship that had been at home _here_? Was it some sort of drive?\n\nMaulbow must know. He'd known enough to design the instruments required\nto bring the battered monster back to life. On the other hand, he had\nnot foreseen in all detail what could happen once the thing was in\noperation, because the _Queen's_ sudden buck-jumping act had surprised\nhim and knocked him out.\n\nThe first step, in any event, was to get Maulbow awake now. To tamper\nwith a device like this, before learning as much as one could about it,\nwould be lunatic foolhardiness. It looked like too good a bet that the\nnext serious mistake made by anybody would finish them all--\n\nPerhaps it was only because Gefty's nerves were on edge that he grew\naware at that point in his reflections of two minor signals from his\nsenses. One was that the smell of ammonia, which he had almost stopped\nnoticing, was becoming appreciably stronger. The other was the faintest\nof sounds--a whispering suggestion of motion somewhere behind him. But\nhere in the storage vault nothing should have moved, and Gefty's muscles\nwere tensing as his head came around. Almost in the same instant, he\nflung himself wildly to one side, stumbling and regaining his balance as\nsomething big and dark slapped heavily down on the floor at the point\nwhere he had stood. Then he was darting up through the entrance passage,\nturning, and knocking down the lock switches on the outside door panel.\n\nIt came flowing around the corner of the passage behind him as the vault\ndoors began to slide together. He was aware mainly of swift, smooth,\noiling motion like that of a big snake; then, for a fraction of a\nsecond, a strip of brighter light from the outside passage showed a\nlong, heavy wedge of a head, a green metal-glint of staring eyes.\n\nThe doors closed silently into their frames and locked. The thing was\ninside. But it was almost a minute then before Gefty could control his\nshaking legs enough to start moving back towards the main deck. In the\nhalf-dark of the vault, it had looked like a big coiled cable lying next\nto the packing cases. Like Maulbow, it might have been battered around\nand knocked out during the recent disturbance; and when it recovered, it\nhad found Gefty in the vault with it. But it might also have been awake\nall the while, waiting cunningly until Gefty's attention seemed fixed\nelsewhere before launching its attack. It was big enough to have\nflattened him and smashed every bone in his body if the stroke had\nlanded.\n\nSome kind of guard animal--a snakelike watchdog? What other connection\ncould it have with the mystery machine? Perhaps Maulbow had intended to\nleave it confined in one of the cases, and it had broken loose--\n\nToo many questions by now, Gefty thought. But Maulbow had the answers.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was hurrying up the main deck's central passage when Maulbow's voice\naddressed him sharply from a door he'd just passed.\n\n\"Stop right there, Rammer! Don't dare to move! I--\"\n\nThe voice ended on a note of surprise. Gefty's reaction had not been too\nrational, but it was prompt. Maulbow's tone and phrasing implied he was\narmed. Gefty wasn't, but he kept a gun in the instrument room for\nemergencies. He'd been through a whole series of unnerving experiences,\nwinding up with being shagged out of his storage vault by something that\nstank of ammonia and looked like a giant snake. To have one of the\n_Queen's_ passengers order him to stand where he was topped it off.\nEvery other consideration was swept aside by a great urge to get his\nhands on his gun.\n\nHe glanced back, saw Maulbow coming out of the half-opened door,\nsomething like a twenty-inch, thin, white rod in one hand. Then Gefty\nwent bounding on along the passage, hunched forward and zigzagging from\nwall to wall to give Maulbow--if the thing he held was a weapon and he\nactually intended to use it--as small and erratic a target as possible.\nMaulbow shouted angrily behind him. Then, as Gefty came up to the next\ncross-passage, a line of white fire seared through the air across his\nshoulders and smashed off the passage wall.\n\nWith that, he was around the corner, and boiling mad. He had no great\nliking for gunfire, but it didn't shake him like the silently attacking\nbeast in the dark storage had done. He reached the deserted instrument\nroom not many seconds later, had his gun out and cocked, and was faced\nback towards the passage by which he had entered. Maulbow, if he had\npursued without hesitation, should be arriving by now. But the passage\nstayed quiet. Gefty couldn't see into it from where he stood. He waited,\ntrying to steady his breathing, wondering where Kerim Ruse was and what\nhad got into Maulbow. After a moment, without taking his eyes from the\npassage entrance, he reached into the wall closet from which he had\ntaken the gun and fished out another souvenir of his active service\ndays, a thin-bladed knife in a slip-sheath. Gefty worked the fastenings\nof the sheath over his left wrist and up his forearm under his coat,\ntested the release to make sure it was functioning, and shook his coat\nsleeve back into place.\n\nThe passage was still quiet. Gefty moved softly over to one of the\nchairs, took a small cushion from it and pitched it out in front of the\nentrance.\n\nThere was a hiss. The cushion turned in midair into a puff of bright\nwhite fire. Gefty aimed his gun high at the far passage wall just beyond\nthe entrance and pulled the trigger. It was a projectile gun. He heard\nthe slug screech off the slick plastic bulkhead and go slamming down the\npassage. Somebody out there made a startled, incoherent noise. But not\nthe kind of a noise a man makes when he's just been hit.\n\n\"If you come in here armed,\" Gefty called, \"I'll blow your head off.\nWant to stop this nonsense now?\"\n\nThere was a moment's silence. Then Maulbow's voice replied shakily from\nthe passage. He seemed to be standing about twenty feet back from the\nroom.\n\n\"If you'll end your thoughtless attempts at interference, Rammer,\" he\nsaid, \"there will be no trouble.\" He was speaking with the restraint of\na man who is in a state of cold fury. \"You're endangering us all. You\nmust realize that you have no understanding of what you are doing.\"\n\nWell, the last could be true enough. \"We'll talk about it,\" Gefty said\nwithout friendliness. \"I haven't done anything yet, but I'm not just\nhanding the ship over to you. And what have you done with Miss Ruse?\"\n\nMaulbow hesitated again. \"She's in the map room,\" he said then. \"I ...\nit was necessary to restrict her movements for a while. But you might as\nwell let her out now. We must reach an agreement without loss of time.\"\n\nGefty glanced over his shoulder at the small closed door of the map\nroom. There was no lock on the door, and he had heard no sound from\ninside; this might be some trick. But it wouldn't take long to find out.\nHe backed up to the wall, pushed the door open and looked inside.\n\nKerim was there, sitting on a chair in one corner of the tiny room. The\nreason she hadn't made any noise became clear. She and the chair were\ncovered by a rather closely fitting sack of transparent, glistening\nfabric. She stared out through it despairingly at Gefty, her lips moving\nurgently. But no sound came from the sack.\n\nGefty called angrily, \"Maulbow--\"\n\n\"Don't excite yourself, Rammer.\" There was a suggestion of what might be\ncontempt in Maulbow's tone now. \"The girl hasn't been harmed. She can\nbreathe easily through the restrainer. And you can remove it by pulling\nat the material from outside.\"\n\nGefty's mouth tightened. \"I'll keep my gun on the passage while I do\nit--\"\n\nMaulbow didn't answer. Gefty edged back into the map room, tentatively\ngrasped the transparent stuff above Kerim's shoulder. To his surprise,\nit parted like wet tissue. He pulled sharply, and in a moment Kerim came\npeeling herself out of it, her face tear-stained, working desperately\nwith hands, elbows and shoulders.\n\n\"Gefty,\" she gasped, \"he ... Mr. Maulbow--\"\n\n\"He's out in the passage there,\" Gefty said. \"He can hear you.\" His\nglance shifted for an instant to the wall where a second of the\nshroudlike transparencies was hanging. And who could that have been\nintended for, he thought, but Gefty Rammer? He added, \"We've had a\nlittle trouble.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" She looked out of the room towards the passage, then at the gun in\nGefty's hand, then up at his face.\n\n\"Maulbow,\" Gefty went on, speaking distinctly enough to make sure\nMaulbow heard, \"has a gun, too. He'll stay there in the passage and\nwe'll stay in the instrument room until we agree on what should be done.\nHe's responsible for what's happened and seems to know where we are.\"\n\nHe looked at Kerim's frightened eyes, dropped his voice to a whisper.\n\"Don't let this worry you too much. I haven't found out just what he's\nup to, but so far his tricks have pretty much backfired. He was counting\non taking us both by surprise, for one thing. That didn't work, so now\nhe'd like us to co-operate.\"\n\n\"Are you going to?\"\n\nGefty shrugged. \"Depends on what he has in mind. I'm just interested in\ngetting us out of this alive. Let's hear what Maulbow has to say--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSome minutes later Gefty was trying to decide whether it was taking a\nworse risk to believe what Maulbow said than to keep things stalled on\nthe chance that he was lying.\n\nKerim Ruse, perched stiffly erect on the edge of a chair, eyes big and\nround, face almost colorless, apparently believed Maulbow and was\nwishing she didn't. There was, of course, some supporting evidence ...\nprimarily the improbable appearance of their surroundings. The\npencil-thin fire-spouter and the sleazy-looking \"restrainer\" had a\nsufficiently unfamiliar air to go with Maulbow's story; but as far as\nGefty knew, either of them could have been manufactured in the Hub.\n\nThen there was the janandra--the big, snakish thing in the storage which\nMaulbow had brought back up from the moon along with the battered\nmachine. It had been, he said, his shipboard companion on another\nvoyage. It wasn't ordinarily aggressive--Gefty's sudden appearance in\nthe vault must have startled it into making an attack. It was not\nexactly a pet. There was a psychological relationship between it and\nMaulbow which Maulbow would not attempt to explain because Gefty and\nKerim would be unable to grasp its significance. The janandra was\nessential, in this unexplained manner, to his well-being.\n\nThat item was almost curious enough to seem to substantiate his other\nstatements; but it didn't really prove anything. The only point Gefty\ndidn't question in the least was that they were in a bad spot which\nmight be getting worse rapidly. His gaze shifted back to the screens.\nWhat he saw out there, surrounding the ship, was, according to Maulbow,\nan illusion of space created by the time flow in which they were moving.\n\nAlso according to Maulbow, there was a race of the future, human in\nappearance, with machines to sail the current of time through the\nuniverse--to run and tack with the winds of time, dipping in and out of\nthe normspace of distant periods and galaxies as they chose. Maulbow,\none of the explorers, had met disaster a million light-years from the\nhome of his kind, centuries behind them, his vehicle wrecked on an\nairless moon with damaged control unit and shattered instruments. He had\nmade his way to a human civilization to obtain the equipment he needed,\nand returned at last with the _Silver Queen_ to where the time-sailer\nlay buried.\n\nGefty's lip curled. No, he wasn't buying all that just yet--but if\nMaulbow was _not_ lying, then the unseen stars were racing past, the\nmass of the galaxy beginning to slide by, eventually to be lost forever\nbeyond a black distance no space drive could span. The matter simply had\nto be settled quickly. But Maulbow was also strained and impatient, and\nif his impatience could be increased a little more, he might start\ntelling the things that really mattered, the things Gefty had to know.\nGefty asked slowly, as if hesitant to commit himself, \"Why did you bring\nus along?\"\n\nThe voice from the passage snapped, \"Because my resources were nearly\nexhausted, Rammer! I couldn't obtain a new ship. Therefore I chartered\nyours; and you came with it. As for Miss Ruse--in spite of every\nprecaution, my activities may have aroused suspicion and curiosity among\nyour people. When I disappeared, Miss Ruse might have been questioned. I\ncouldn't risk being followed to the wreck of the sailer, so I took her\nwith me. And what does that mean against what I have offered you? The\ngreatest adventure--followed, I give you my solemn word, by a safe\nreturn to your own place and time, and the most generous compensations\nfor any inconvenience you may have suffered!\"\n\nKerim, looking up at Gefty, shook her head violently. Gefty said, \"We\nfind it difficult to take you on trust now, Maulbow. Why do you want to\nget into the instrument room?\"\n\nMaulbow was silent for some seconds. Then he said, \"As I told you, this\nship would not have been buffeted about during the moments of transfer\nif the control unit were operating with complete efficiency. Certain\nadjustments will have to be made in the unit, and this should be done\npromptly.\"\n\n       *       *       *\n\n\"Where do the ship instruments come in?\" Gefty asked.\n\n\"I can determine the nature of the problem from them. When I was ...\nstranded ... the unit was seriously damaged. My recent repairs were\nnecessarily hasty. I--\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"What caused the crack-up?\"\n\nMaulbow said, tone taut with impatience, \"Certain sections of the Great\nCurrent are infested with dangerous forces. I shall not attempt to\ndescribe them ...\"\n\n\"I wouldn't get it?\"\n\n\"I don't pretend to understand them very well myself, Rammer. They are\nnot life but show characteristics of life--even of intelligent life. If\nyou can imagine radiant energy being capable of conscious hostility....\"\n\nThere was a chill at the back of Gefty's neck. \"A big, fast-moving\nlight?\"\n\n\"Yes!\" Sharp concern showed suddenly in the voice from the passage. \"You\n... when did you see that?\"\n\nGefty glanced at the screens. \"Twice since you've been talking. And\nonce before--immediately after we got tumbled around.\"\n\n\"Then we can waste no more time, Rammer. Those forces are sensitive to\nthe fluctuations of the control unit. If they were close enough to be\nseen, they're aware the ship is here. They were attempting to locate\nit.\"\n\n\"What could they do?\"\n\nMaulbow said, \"A single attack was enough to put the control unit out of\noperation in my sailer. The Great Current then rejected us instantly. A\nship of this size might afford more protection, which is the reason I\nchose it. But if the control unit is not adjusted immediately to enable\nit to take us out of this section, the attacks will continue until the\nship--and we--have been destroyed.\"\n\nGefty drew a deep breath. \"There's another solution to that problem,\nMaulbow. Miss Ruse and I prefer it. And if you meant what you said--that\nyou'd see to it we got back eventually--you shouldn't object either.\"\n\nThe voice asked sharply, \"What do you mean?\"\n\nGefty said, \"Shut the control unit off. From what you were saying, that\nthrows us automatically back into normspace, while we're still close\nenough to the Hub. You'll find plenty of people there who'll stake you\nto a trip to the future if they can go along and are convinced they'll\nreturn. Miss Ruse and I don't happen to be that adventurous.\"\n\nThere was silence from the passage. Gefty added, \"Take your time to make\nup your mind about it, if you want to. I don't like the idea of those\nlights hitting us, but neither do you. And I think I can wait this out\nas well as you can....\"\n\nThe silence stretched out. Presently Gefty said, \"If you do accept,\nslide that fire-shooting device of yours into the room before you show\nup. We don't want accidents.\"\n\nHe paused again. Kerim was chewing her lips, hands clenched into small\nfists in her lap. Then Maulbow answered, voice flat and expressionless\nnow.\n\n\"The worst thing we can do at present,\" he said, \"is to prolong a\ndispute about possible courses of action. If I disarm, will you lay\naside your gun?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then I accept your conditions, disappointing as they are.\"\n\nHe was silent. After a moment, Gefty heard the white rod clatter lightly\nalong the floor of the passage. It struck the passage wall, spun off it,\nand rolled into the instrument room, coming to rest a few feet away from\nhim. Gefty hesitated, picked it up and laid it on the wall table. He\nplaced his own gun beside it, moved a dozen steps away. Kerim's eyes\nfollowed him anxiously.\n\n\"Gefty,\" she whispered, \"he might ...\"\n\nGefty looked at her, formed the words \"It's all right\" with his mouth\nand called, \"Guns have been put aside, Maulbow. Come on in, and let's\nkeep it peaceable.\"\n\nHe waited, arms hanging loosely at his side, heart beating heavily, as\nquick footsteps came up the passage. Maulbow appeared in the entrance,\nglanced at Gefty and Kerim, then about the room. His gaze rested for a\nmoment on the wall table, shifted back to Gefty. Maulbow came on into\nthe room, turning towards Gefty, mouth twisting.\n\nHe said softly, \"It is not our practice, Rammer, to share the secrets of\nthe Great Current with other races. I hadn't foreseen that you might\nbecome a dangerous nuisance. But now--\"\n\nHis right hand began to lift, half closed about some small golden\ninstrument. Gefty's left arm moved back and quickly forwards.\n\nThe service knife slid out of its sheath and up from his palm as an\narrow of smoky blackness burst from the thing in Maulbow's hand. The\nblackness came racing with a thin, snarling noise across the floor\ntowards Gefty's feet. The knife flashed above it, turning, and stood\nhilt-deep in Maulbow's chest.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGefty returned a few minutes later from the forward cabin which served\nas the _Queen's_ sick bay, and said to Kerim, \"He's still alive, though\nI don't know why. He may even recover. He's full of anesthetic, and that\nshould keep him quiet till we're back in normspace. Then I'll see what\nwe can do for him.\"\n\nKerim had lost some of her white, shocked look while he was gone. \"You\nknew he would try to kill you?\" she asked shakily.\n\n\"Suspected he had it in mind--he gave in too quick. But I thought I'd\nhave a chance to take any gadget he was hiding away from him first. I\nwas wrong about that. Now we'd better move fast ...\"\n\nHe switched the emergency check panel back on, glanced over the familiar\npatterns of lights and numbers. A few minor damage spots were indicated,\nbut the ship was still fully operational. One minor damage spot which\ndid not appear on the panel was now to be found in the instrument room\nitself, in the corner on which the door of the map room opened. The\ndoor, the adjoining bulkheads and section of flooring were scarred,\nblackened, and as assortedly malodorous as burned things tend to become.\nThat was where Gefty had stood when Maulbow entered the room, and if he\nhad remained there an instant after letting go of the knife, he would\nhave been in very much worse condition than the essentially fireproof\nfurnishings.\n\nBoth Maulbow's weapons--the white rod lying innocently on the wall table\nand the round, golden device which had dropped from his hand spitting\ndarts of smoking blackness--had blasted unnervingly away into that area\nfor almost thirty seconds after Maulbow was down and twisting about on\nthe floor. Then he went limp and the firing instantly stopped.\nApparently, Maulbow's control of them had ended as he lost\nconsciousness.\n\nIt seemed fortunate that the sick bay cabin's emergency treatment\naccessories, gentle as their action was, might have been designed for\nthe specific purpose of keeping the most violent of prisoners\nimmobilized--let alone one with a terrible knife wound in him. At the\nangle along which the knife had driven in and up below the ribs, an\nordinary man would have been dead in seconds. But it was very evident\nnow that Maulbow was no ordinary man, and even after the eerie weapons\nhad been pitched out of the ship through the instrument room's disposal\ntube, Gefty couldn't rid himself of an uncomfortable suspicion that he\nwasn't done with Maulbow yet--wouldn't be done with him, in fact, until\none or the other of them was dead.\n\nHe said to Kerim, \"I thought the machine Maulbow set up in the storage\nvault would turn out to be some drive engine, but apparently it has an\nentirely different function. He connected it with the instruments he had\nmade in the Hub, and together they form what he calls a control unit.\nThe emergency panel would show if the unit were drawing juice from the\nship. It isn't, and I don't know what powers it. But we do know now that\nthe control unit is holding us in the time current, and it will go on\nholding us there as long as it's in operation.\n\n\"If we could shut it off, the _Queen_ would be 'rejected' by the\ncurrent, like Maulbow's sailer was. In other words, we'd get knocked\nback into normspace--which is what we want. And we want it to happen as\nsoon as possible because, if Maulbow was telling the truth on that\npoint, every minute that passes here is taking us farther away from the\nHub, and farther from our own time towards his.\"\n\nKerim nodded, eyes intent on his face.\n\n\"Now I can't just go down there and start slapping switches around on\nthe thing,\" Gefty went on. \"He said it wasn't working right, and even if\nit were, I couldn't tell what would happen. But it doesn't seem to\nconnect up with any ship systems--it just seems to be holding us in a\nfield of its own. So I should be able to move the whole unit into the\ncargo lock and eject it from there. If we shift the _Queen_ outside its\nfield, that should have the same effect as shutting the control unit\noff. It should throw us back into normspace.\"\n\nKerim nodded again. \"What about Mr. Maulbow's janandra animal?\"\n\nGefty shrugged. \"Depends on the mood I find it in. He said it wasn't\nusually aggressive. Maybe it isn't. I'll get into a spacesuit for\nprotection and break out some of the mining equipment to move it along\nwith. If I can maneuver it into an empty compartment where it will be\nout of the ...\"\n\n       *       *       *\n\nHe broke off, expression changing, eyes fastened on the emergency panel.\nThen he turned hurriedly, reached across the side of the console for the\nintership airseal controls. Kerim asked apprehensively, \"What's the\nmatter, Gefty?\"\n\n\"Wish I knew ... exactly.\" Gefty indicated the emergency panel. \"Little\nred light there, on the storage deck section--it wasn't showing a minute\nago. It means that the vault doors have been opened since then.\"\n\nHe saw the same half-superstitious fear appear in her face that had\ntouched him. \"You think _he_ did it?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\" Maulbow's control of the guns had seemed uncanny enough.\nBut that was a different matter. The guns were a product of his own time\nand science. But the vault door mechanisms? There might have been\nsufficient opportunity for Maulbow to study them and alter them, for\nsome purpose of his own, since he'd come aboard....\n\n\"I've got the ship compartments and decks sealed off from each other\nnow,\" Gefty said slowly. \"The only connecting points from one to the\nother are personnel hatches--they're small air locks. So the janandra's\nconfined to the storage deck. If it's come out of the vault, it might be\na nuisance until I can get equipment to handle it. But that isn't too\nserious. The spacesuits are on the second deck, and I'll get into one\nbefore I go on to the storage. You wait here a moment, I'll look in on\nMaulbow again before I start.\"\n\nIf Maulbow wasn't still unconscious, he was doing a good job of feigning\nit. Gefty looked at the pale, lax face, the half-shut eyes, shook his\nhead and left the cabin, locking it behind him. It mightn't be Maulbow's\ndoing, but having the big snake loose in the storage could, in fact,\nmake things extremely awkward now. He didn't think his gun would make\nmuch impression on anything of that size, and while several of the\nship's mining tools could be employed as very effective close-range\nweapons, they happened, unfortunately, to be stored away on the same\ndeck.\n\nHe found Kerim standing in the center of the instrument room, waiting\nfor him.\n\n\"Gefty,\" she said, \"do you notice anything? An odd sort of smell....\"\n\nThen the odor was in Gefty's nostrils, too, and the back of his neck\nturned to ice as he recognized it. He glanced up at the ventilation\noutlet, looked back at Kerim.\n\nHe took her arm, said softly, \"Come this way. Keep very quiet! I don't\nknow how it happened, but the janandra's on the main deck now. That's\nwhat it smells like. The smell's coming through the ventilation system,\nso the thing's moving around in the port section. We'll go the other\nway.\"\n\nKerim whispered, \"What will we do?\"\n\n\"Get ourselves into spacesuits first, and then get Maulbow's control\nunit out of the ship. The janandra may be looking around for him. If it\nis, it won't bother us.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe hadn't wanted to remind Kerim that, from what Maulbow said, there\nmight be more than one reason for getting rid of the control unit as\nquickly as possible. But it had been constantly in the back of his mind;\nand twice, in the few minutes that passed after Maulbow's strange\nweapons were silenced, he had seen a momentary pale glare appear in the\nunquiet flow of darkness reflecting in the viewscreens. Gefty had said\nnothing, because if it was true that hostile forces were alert and\nsearching for them here, it added to their immediate danger but not at\nall to the absolute need to free themselves from the inexorable rush of\nthe Great Current before they were carried beyond hope of return to\ntheir civilization.\n\nBut those brief glimpses did add to the sense of urgency throbbing in\nGefty's nerves, while events, and the equally hard necessity to avoid a\nfatally mistaken move in this welter of unknown factors, kept blocking\nhim. Now the mysterious manner in which Maulbow's unpleasant traveling\ncompanion had appeared on the main deck made it impossible to do\nanything but keep Kerim at his side. If Maulbow was still capable of\ntaking a hand in matters, there was no reasonably safe place to leave\nher aboard the _Queen_.\n\nAnd Maulbow might be capable of it. Twice as they hurried up the narrow,\nangled passages along the _Queen's_ curving hull towards an airseal\nleading to the next compartment, Gefty caught a trace of the\nammonia-like animal odor coming over the ventilating system. They\nreached the lock without incident; but then, as they came along the\nsecond deck hall to the ship's magazine, there was a sharp click in the\nstillness behind them. Its meaning was disconcertingly apparent. Gefty\nhesitated, turned Kerim into a side passage, guided her along it.\n\nShe looked up at his face. \"It's following us?\"\n\n\"Seems to be.\" No time for the spacesuits in the magazine now--something\nhad just emerged from the air lock through which they had entered the\nsecond deck not many moments before. He helped the girl quickly down a\nsection of ladderlike stairs to the airseal connecting the second deck\nwith the storage, punched a wall button there. As the lock door opened,\nthere was another noise from the passage they had just left, as if\nsomething had thudded briefly and heavily against one of the bulkheads.\nKerim uttered a little gasp. Then they were in the lock, and Gefty\nslapped down two other buttons, stood watching the door behind them snap\nshut and, a few seconds later, the one on the far side open on the dark\nstorage deck.\n\nThey scrambled down another twelve feet of ladder to the floor of a side\npassage, hearing the lock snap shut behind them. As it closed, they were\nin complete darkness. Gefty seized Kerim's arm, ran with her up the\npassage to the left, guiding himself with his fingertips on the left\nbulkhead. When they came to a corner, he turned her to the left again. A\nfew seconds later, he pulled open a small door, bundled the girl\nthrough, came in himself, and shut the door to a narrow slit behind\nthem.\n\nKerim whispered shakily, \"What will we do now, Gefty?\"\n\n\"Stay here for the moment. It'll look for us in the vault first.\"\n\nAnd it should go to the storage vault first where it had been guarding\nMaulbow's machine, to hunt for them there. But it might not. Gefty eased\nthe gun from his pocket on the far side of Kerim. Across the dark\ncompartment was another door. They could retreat a little farther here\nif it became necessary--but not very much farther.\n\nThey waited in a silence that was complete except for their unsteady\nbreathing and the distant, deep pulse of the _Queen's_ throttled-down\ndrives. He felt Kerim trembling against him. How did Maulbow's creature\nmove through the airseal locks? The operating mechanisms were simple--a\ndog might have been taught to use them. But a dog had paws....\n\nThere came the soft hiss of the opening lock, the faintest shimmer of\nlight to the right of the passage mouth he was watching through the\ndoor. A heavy thump on the floor below the locks followed, then a hard\nclick as the lock closed and complete darkness returned.\n\nThe silence resumed. Seconds dragged on. Gefty's imagination pictured\nthe thing waiting, its great, wedge-shaped head raised as its senses\nprobed the dark about it for a sign of the two human beings. Then a\nvague rushing noise began, growing louder as it approached the passage\nmouth, crossing it, receding rapidly again to the left.\n\nGefty let his breath out slowly, eased the door open and stood listening\nagain. Abruptly, there was reflected light in the lock passage, coming\nnow from the left. He said in a whisper, \"It's moving around in the main\nhall, Kerim. We can go on the other way now, but we'll have to be fast\nand keep quiet. I've thought of how we can get rid of that thing.\"\n\n       *       *       *\n\nThe cargo lock on the storage deck had two inner doors. The one which\nopened into the side of the vault hall was built to allow passage of the\nlargest chunks of freight the _Queen_ was likely to be burdened with; it\nwas almost thirty feet wide and twenty high. The second door was just\nlarge enough to let a man in a spacesuit climb in and out of the side of\nthe lock without using the freight door. It opened on a tiny control\ncubicle from which the lock's mechanisms were operated during loading\nprocesses.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nGefty let Kerim and himself into the cubicle from one of the passages,\nsteered the girl through the pitch blackness of the little room to the\nchair before the control panel and told her to sit down. He groped for a\nmoment at the side of the panel, found a knob and twisted it. There was\na faint click. A scattering of pale lights appeared suddenly on the\npanel, a dark viewscreen, set at a tilt above them, reflecting their\ngleam.\n\nGefty explained in a low voice, \"Left side of that screen covers the\nlock. Right one covers the big hall outside. No lights in either at the\nmoment, so you don't see anything. Only way the cargo door to the hall\ncan be opened or closed is with these switches right here. What I want\nto do is get the janandra into the lock, slam the door on it and lock\ndown the control switches. Then we've got it trapped.\"\n\n\"But how are you going to get it to go in there?\"\n\n\"No real problem--I'll be three jumps ahead of it. Then I duck back up\ninto this cubicle, and lock both doors. And it'll be inside the lock.\nYou have the picture now?\"\n\nKerim said unsteadily, \"I do. But it sounds awfully risky, Gefty.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't like it either,\" Gefty admitted. \"So I'll start right now\nbefore I lose my nerve. As soon as I move out into the vault hall, the\nlighting will go on. That's automatic. You watch the right side of the\nscreen. If you see the janandra coming before I do, yell as loud as you\ncan.\"\n\nHe shifted the two inner door switches to the right. A red spark\nappeared in the dark viewscreen, high up near the center. A second red\nlight showed on the cubicle bulkhead beside Gefty. Beneath it an oblong\nsection of the bulkhead turned silently away on heavy hinges, became a\ndoor two feet in thickness, which stood jutting out at a right angle\ninto the darkness of the cargo lock. A wave of cold air moved through it\ninto the control cubicle.\n\nOn the screen, another red spark appeared beside the first one.\n\n\"Both doors are open now,\" Gefty murmured to the girl. \"The janandra\nisn't in the vault hall or the lighting would have turned on, but it may\nhave heard the door open and be on its way. So keep watching the\nscreen.\"\n\n\"I certainly will!\" she whispered shakily.\n\nGefty took an oversized wrench from the wall, climbed quickly and\nquietly down the three ladder steps to the floor of the lock, and walked\nacross it to the sill of the giant freight door, which now had swung out\nand down into the vault hall, fitting itself into a depression of the\nflooring. He hesitated an instant on the sill, then stepped out into the\nbig dark hall. Light filled it immediately in both directions.\n\nHe stood quiet, intent on the storage vault entrance far up the hall to\nhis left. He could see the vault was open. The janandra might still be\ninside it. But the seconds passed, and the dark entrance remained silent\nand there was no suggestion of motion beyond it. Gefty glanced to the\nright, moved a dozen steps farther out into the hall, hefted the wrench\nand spun it through the air towards the ventilator frame on the opposite\nbulkhead.\n\nThe heavy tool clanged loudly against the frame, bounced off and thudded\nto the floor. Gefty started slowly over to it, heart pounding, with the\nvault entrance still at the edge of his vision.\n\nKerim's voice screamed, \"_Gefty, it's_--\"\n\nHe spun around, sprinted back to the cargo lock. The janandra had come\nsilently out of the nearest side passage behind him, was approaching\nwith the remembered oiling swiftness of motion, its great head lifted a\nyard from the floor. Gefty plunged through the lock, jumped for the top\nof the cubicle door steps, came stumbling into the cubicle. Kerim was on\nher feet, staring. He swung the cubicle door switch to the left,\nslapping it flat to the panel. The door snapped back into the wall\nbehind him with a force that shook the floor.\n\nOn the screen, the janandra's thick, dark worm-shape was swinging around\nin the dim lock to regain the open hall. It had seen the trap. But the\nfreight door switch went flat beside the other, and the freight door\nrose with massive swiftness. The heavy body smashed against it, went\nsliding back to the floor as the door slammed shut and the screen\nsection showing the cargo lock turned dark.\n\n\"Got it--got it--got it!\" Gefty heard himself whispering exultantly. He\nswitched on the lock's interior lights.\n\nThen he swore softly, and, beside him, Kerim sucked in her breath.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe screen showed the janandra in violent but apparently purposeful\nmotion inside the lock ... and it was also apparent now that it was a\nmore complexly constructed creature than the long worm-body and heavy\nhead had indicated. The skin, to a distance of some eight feet back of\nthe head, had spread out into a wide, flexible frill. From beneath the\nfrill extended half a dozen jointed, bone-white arms, along with waving,\nribbonlike appendages less easy to define. The thing was reared half up\nalong the hall door, inspecting its surface with these members; then\nsuddenly it flung itself around and flashed over to the outer lock door.\nThree arms shot out; wiry fingers caught the three spin-locks\nsimultaneously, began to whirl them.\n\nGefty said, staring, \"Kerim, it's going to ...\"\n\nThe janandra didn't. The motion checked suddenly, was reversed. The\nlocks drew tight again. The janandra swung back from the door, lifting\nhalf its length upwards, big head weaving about as it inspected the tool\nracks overhead. An arm reached suddenly, snatched something from one of\nthe racks. Then the thing turned again; and in the next instant its head\nfilled the viewscreen. Kerim made a choked sound of fright, jerking back\nagainst Gefty. The bulging, metal-green eyes seemed to stare directly at\nhim. And the screen went black.\n\nKerim whispered, \"Wha ... what happened, Gefty?\"\n\nGefty swallowed, said, \"It smashed the view pickup. Must have guessed we\nwere watching and didn't like it....\" He added, \"I was beginning to\nthink Maulbow must be some kind of superman. But it wasn't any\nremote-control magic of his that let the janandra out of the vault, and\nopened the intership locks when it came up to the main deck and followed\nus down again. It was doing all that for itself. It's Maulbow's partner,\nnot his pet. And it's probably got at least as good a brain as anyone\nelse on board behind that ugly face.\"\n\nKerim moistened her lips. \"Can it ... could it get out again?\"\n\n\"Into the ship?\" Gefty shook his head decidedly. \"Uh-uh. It could dump\nitself out on the other side--and it almost did before it realized where\nit was and what it was about to do. But the inner lock doors won't open\nuntil someone opens them right on this panel. No, the thing's safely\ntrapped. On the other hand ...\"\n\nOn the other hand, Gefty realized that he wouldn't now be able to bring\nhimself to eject the janandra out of the cargo lock and into the Great\nCurrent. Its intentions obviously hadn't been friendly, but its level of\nintelligence was as good as his own, and perhaps somewhat better; and at\npresent it was helpless. To dispose of it as he'd had in mind would\ntherefore be the cold-blooded murder of an equal. But so long as that\nugly and formidable shipmate of Maulbow's stayed in the cargo lock, the\nlock couldn't be used to get rid of the control unit in the vault.\n\nA new solution presented itself while Gefty was making a rapid and\nrather desperate mental review of various heavy-duty tools which might\nbe employed as weapons to force the janandra into submission and haul it\noff for confinement elsewhere in the ship. Not impossible, but a highly\nprecarious and time-consuming operation at best. Then another thought\noccurred: the storage vault lay directly against the hull of the\n_Queen_--\n\nHow long to cut through the hull? The ship's mining equipment was on\nboard, and the tools were self-powered. Climb into a spacesuit, empty\nthe air from the entire storage deck, leaving the janandra imprisoned in\nthe cargo lock ... with Maulbow incapacitated in sick bay, and Kerim\nback in the control compartment and also in a suit, for additional\nprotection. Then cut ship's power to this deck to avoid complications\nwith the _Queen's_ involved circuitry and work under space\nconditions--half an hour if he hurried.\n\n       *       *       *\n\n\"Shouldn't take more than another ten minutes,\" he informed Kerim\npresently over the suit's intercom.\n\n\"I'm very glad to hear it, Gefty.\" She sounded shaky.\n\n\"Anything going on in the screens?\" he asked.\n\nShe hesitated a little, said, \"No. Not at the moment.\"\n\nGefty grunted, blinked sweat from his eyes, and took hold of the\nhandgrips of the heavy mining cutter again, turning it nose down towards\nthe vault floor. The guide light found the point he was working on, and\nthe slice beam stabbed out, began nibbling delicately away to extend the\ncurving line it had eaten through the _Queen's_ thick skin. He had drawn\na twenty-five foot circle around Maulbow's battered control unit and the\ninstruments attached to it, well outside the fragile-looking safety\nfield. The circle was broken at four points where he would plant\nexplosives. The explosives, going off together, should shatter the\nconnecting links with the hull and throw the machine clear. If that\ndidn't release them immediately from its influence, he would see what\nputting the _Queen's_ drives into action would do.\n\n\"Gefty?\" Kerim's voice asked.\n\n\"Uh-huh?\"\n\nHe could hear her swallow over the intercom. \"Those lights are back\nnow.\"\n\n\"How many?\"\n\n\"Two,\" Kerim said. \"I _think_ they're only two. They keep crossing back\nand forth in front of us.\" She laughed nervously. \"It's idiotic, of\ncourse, but I do get the feeling they're looking at us.\"\n\nGefty said hesitantly, \"Everything's set but I need another minute or\ntwo to get this last connection whittled down a little more. If I blow\nthe charge too soon, it mightn't take the gadget clean out of the ship.\"\n\nKerim said, \"I know. I'll just watch ... they just disappeared again.\"\nHer voice changed. \"Now there's something else.\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"You know you said to watch the cargo lock lights on the emergency\npanel.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"The outer lock door has just been opened.\"\n\n\"What!\"\n\n\"It must have been. The light started blinking red just now as I was\nlooking at it.\"\n\nGefty was silent a moment, his mind racing. Why would the janandra open\nthe lock? From what Maulbow had said, it could live for a while without\nair, but it still could gain nothing but eventual death from leaving the\nship--\n\nUnless, Gefty thought, the janandra had become aware in some way that he\nwas about to blow their machine out of the _Queen_. There were grappling\nlines in the cargo lock, and if four or five of those lines were slapped\nto the circular section of the hull he'd loosened ...\n\n\"Kerim,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"I'm going to blow the deal right now. Got your suit snapped to the wall\nbraces like I showed you?\"\n\n\"Yes, Gefty.\" Her voice was faint but clear.\n\nHe turned the cutter away from the line it had dug, sent it rolling off\ntowards the far wall. He hurried around the circle, checking the four\ncharges, lumbered over to the vault passage, stopped just around the\ncorner. He took the firing box from his suit.\n\n\"Ready, Kerim?\" He opened the box.\n\n\"Ready....\"\n\n\"Here goes!\" Gefty reached into the box, twisted the firing handle.\nLight flared in the vault. The deck shook below him. He came stumbling\nout from behind the wall.\n\nMaulbow's machine and its stand of instruments had vanished. Where it\nhad stood was a dark circular hole. Nothing else seemed to have\nhappened. Gefty clumped hurriedly over to the mining cutter, swung it\naround, started more cautiously back towards the hole. He didn't have\nthe faintest idea what would come next, but a definite possibility was\nthat he would see the janandra's dark form flowing up over the rim of\nthe hole. Letting it run into the cutter beam might be the best way to\ndiscourage it from re-entering the _Queen_.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nInstead, a dazzling brilliance suddenly blotted out everything. The\ncutter was plucked from Gefty's grasp; then he was picked up, suit and\nall, and slammed up towards the vault ceiling. He had a feeling that\ninaudible thunders were shaking the ship. He seemed to be rolling over\nand over along the ceiling. At last, the suit crashed into something\nwhich showed a total disinclination to yield, and Gefty blacked out.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe left side of his face felt pushed out of shape; his left eye wasn't\nfunctioning too well, and there was a severe pulsing ache throughout the\ntop of his head. But Gefty felt happy.\n\nThere were a few qualifying considerations.\n\n\"Of course,\" he pointed out to Kerim, \"all we can really say immediately\nis that we're back in normspace and somewhere in the galaxy.\"\n\nShe smiled shakily. \"Isn't that saying quite a lot, Gefty?\"\n\n\"It's something.\" Gefty glanced around the instrument room. He had\nplaced an emergency light on the console, but except for that, the\ncontrol compartment was in darkness. The renewed battering the _Queen_\nhad absorbed had knocked out the power in the forward section. The\nviewscreens were black, every instrument dead. But he'd seen the stars\nof normspace through the torn vault floor. It was something....\n\n\"We might have the light that slugged us to thank for that,\" he said.\n\"I'm not sure just what did happen there, but it could have been\nMaulbow's control unit it was attacking rather than the ship. Maulbow\nsaid the lights were sensitive to the unit. At any rate, we're here, and\nwe're rid of the gadget--and of the janandra.\" He hesitated. \"I just\ndon't feel you should get your hopes too high. We may find out we're a\nvery long way from the Hub.\"\n\nKerim's large eyes showed a degree of confidence which made him almost\nuncomfortable. \"If we are,\" she said serenely, \"you'll get us back\nsomehow.\"\n\nGefty cleared his throat. \"Well, we'll see. If the power shutoff is\nsomething the _Queen's_ repair scanners can handle, the instruments will\ncome back on any minute. Give the scanners ten minutes. If they haven't\ndone it by that time, they can't do it and I'll have to play repairman.\nThen, with the instruments working, we can determine exactly where we\nare.\"\n\nUnless, he told himself silently, they'd wound up in a distant cluster\nnever penetrated by the Federation's mapping teams. And there was the\nother little question of where they now were in time. But Kerim looked\nrosy with relief, and those details could wait.\n\nHe took up another emergency light, switched it on and said, \"I'll see\nhow Maulbow is doing while we're waiting for power. If the first aid\ntreatment has pulled him through so far, the autosurgeon probably can\nfix him up.\"\n\nKerim's face suddenly took on a guilty expression. \"I forgot all about\nMr. Maulbow!\" She hesitated. \"Should I come along?\"\n\nGefty shook his head. \"I won't need help. And if it's a case for the\nsurgeon, you wouldn't like it. Those things work painlessly, but it gets\nto be a mess for a while.\"\n\nHe shut off the light again when he reached the sick bay which was\nrunning on its independent power system. As he opened the cabin door\nfrom the dispensary, carrying the autosurgeon, it became evident that\nMaulbow was still alive but that he might be in delirium. Gefty placed\nthe surgeon on the table, went over to the bed and looked at Maulbow.\n\nTo the extent that the emergency treatment instruments' cautious\nrestraints permitted, Maulbow was twisting slowly about on the bed. He\nwas speaking in a low, rapid voice, his face distorted by emotion. The\nwords were not slurred, but they were in a language Gefty didn't know.\nIt seemed clear that Maulbow had reverted mentally to his own time, and\nfor some seconds he remained unaware that Gefty had entered the room.\nThen, surprisingly, the slitted blue eyes opened wider and focused on\nGefty's face. And Maulbow screamed with rage.\n\nGefty felt somewhat disconcerted. For the reason alone that he was under\nanesthetic, Maulbow should not have been conscious. But he was. The\nwords were now ones Gefty could understand, and Maulbow was telling him\nthings which would have been interesting enough under different\ncircumstances. Gefty broke in as soon as he could.\n\n\"Look,\" he said quietly, \"I'm trying to help you. I ...\"\n\nMaulbow interrupted him in turn, not at all quietly. Gefty listened a\nmoment longer, then shrugged. So Maulbow didn't like him. He couldn't\nsay honestly that he'd ever liked Maulbow much, and what he was hearing\nmade him like Maulbow considerably less. But he would keep the man from\nthe future alive if he could.\n\nHe positioned the autosurgeon behind the head of the bed to allow the\ndevice to begin its analysis, stood back at its controls where he could\nboth follow the progress it made and watch Maulbow without exciting him\nfurther by remaining within his range of vision. After a moment, the\nsurgeon shut off the first-aid instruments and made unobtrusive use of a\nheavy tranquilizing drug. Then it waited.\n\nMaulbow should have lapsed into passive somnolence thirty seconds\nafterwards. But the drug seemed to produce no more effect on him\nmentally than the preceding anesthetic. He raged and screeched on. Gefty\nwatched him uneasily, knowing now that he was looking at insanity. There\nwas nothing more he could do at the moment--the autosurgeon's decisions\nwere safer than any nonprofessional's guesswork. And the surgeon\ncontinued to wait.\n\nThen, abruptly, Maulbow died. The taut body slumped against the bed and\nthe contorted features relaxed. The eyes remained half open; and when\nGefty came around to the side of the bed, they still seemed to be\nlooking up at him, but they no longer moved. A thin trickle of blood\nstarted from the side of the slack mouth and stopped again.\n\n       *       *       *\n\nThe control compartment was still darkened and without power when Gefty\nreturned to it. He told Kerim briefly what had happened, added, \"I'm not\nat all sure now he was even human. I'd rather believe he wasn't.\"\n\n\"Why that, Gefty?\" She was studying his expression soberly.\n\nGefty hesitated, said, \"I thought at first he was furious because we'd\nupset his plans. But they weren't his plans ... they were the\njanandra's. He wasn't exactly its servant. I suppose you'd have to say\nhe was something like a pet animal.\"\n\nKerim said incredulously, \"But that isn't possible! Think of how\nintelligently Mr. Maulbow ...\"\n\n\"He was following instructions,\" Gefty said. \"The janandra let him know\nwhatever it wanted done. He was following instructions again when he\ntried to kill me after I'd got away from the thing in the vault. The\nreal brain around here was the janandra ... and it was a real brain.\nWith a little luck it would have had the ship.\"\n\nKerim smiled briefly. \"You handled that big brain rather well, I think.\"\n\n\"I was the one who got lucky,\" Gefty said. \"Anyway, where Maulbow came\nfrom, it's the janandra's kind that gives the orders. And the thing is,\nMaulbow liked it that way. He didn't want it to be different. When the\nlight hit us, it killed the janandra on the outside of the ship. Maulbow\nfelt it happen and it cracked him up. He wanted to kill us for it. But\nsince he was helpless, he killed himself. He didn't want to be\nhealed--not by us. At least, that's what it looks like.\"\n\nHe shrugged, checked his watch, climbed out of the chair. \"Well,\" he\nsaid, \"the ten minutes I gave the _Queen_ to turn the power back on are\nup. Looks like the old girl couldn't do it. So I'll--\"\n\nThe indirect lighting system in the instrument room went on silently.\nThe emergency light flickered and went out. Gefty's head came around.\n\nKerim was staring past him at the screens, her face radiant.\n\n\"Oh, Gefty!\" she cried softly. \"Oh, Gefty! Our stars!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Green dot here is us,\" Gefty explained, somewhat hoarsely. He cleared\nhis throat, went on, \"Our true ship position, that is--\" He stopped,\nrealizing he was talking too much, almost babbling, in an attempt to\ntake some of the tension out of the moment. The next few seconds might\nnot tell them where they were, but it would show whether they had been\ncarried beyond the regions of space charted by Federation instruments.\nWhich would mean the difference between having a chance--whether a good\nchance or a bad one--of getting home eventually, and the alternative of\nbeing hopelessly lost.\n\nThere had been nothing recognizably familiar about the brilliantly dense\nstar patterns in the viewscreens, but he gave no further thought to\nthat. Unless the ship's exact position was known or one was on an\nestablished route, it was a waste of time looking for landmarks in a\nsizable cluster.\n\nHe turned on the basic star chart. Within the locator plate the green\npinpoint of light reappeared, red-ringed and suspended now against the\nthree-dimensional immensities of the Milky Way. It stayed still a\nmoment, began a smooth drift towards Galactic East. Gefty let his breath\nout carefully. He sensed Kerim's eyes on him but kept his gaze fixed on\nthe locator plate.\n\nThe green dot slowed, came to a stop. Gefty's finger tapped the same\nbutton four times. The big chart flicked out of existence, and in the\nplate three regional star maps appeared and vanished in quick succession\nbehind it. The fourth map stayed. For a few seconds, the red-circled\ngreen spark was not visible here. Then it showed at the eastern margin\nof the map, came gliding forwards and to the left, slowed again and\nheld steady. Now the star map began to glide through the locator plate,\ncarrying the fixed green dot with it. It brought the dot up to dead\ncenter point in the locator plate and stopped.\n\nGefty slumped a little. He rubbed his hands slowly down his face and\nmuttered a few words. Then he shook his head.\n\n\"Gefty,\" Kerim whispered, \"what is it? Where are we?\"\n\nGefty looked at her.\n\n\"After we got hauled into that time current,\" he said hoarsely, \"I tried\nto find out which way in space we were headed. The direction indicators\nover there seemed to show we were trying to go everywhere at once. You\nremember Maulbow's control unit wasn't working right, needed\nadjustments. Well, all those little impulses must have pretty well\ncanceled out because we weren't taken really far. In the last hour and a\nhalf we've covered roughly the distance the _Queen_ could have gone on\nher own in, say, thirty days.\"\n\n\"Then where ...\"\n\n\"Home,\" Gefty said simply. \"It's ridiculous! Other side of the Hub from\nwhere we started.\" He nodded at the plate. \"Eastern Hub Quadrant.\nSection Six Eight. The G2 behind the green dot--that's the Evalee\nsystem. We could be putting down at Evalee Interstellar three hours from\nnow if we wanted to.\"\n\nKerim was laughing and crying together. \"Oh, Gefty! I knew you would ...\"\n\n\"A fat lot I had to do with it!\" Gefty leaned forward suddenly, switched\non the transmitter. \"And now let's pick up a live newscast. There's\nsomething else I ...\"\n\nHis voice trailed off. The transmitter screen lit up with a blurred\njumble of print, colors, a muttering of voices, music and noises. Gefty\ntwisted a dial. The screen cleared, showed a newscast headline sheet.\nGefty blinked at it, glanced sideways at Kerim, grimaced.\n\n\"The something else,\" he said, his voice a little strained, \"was\nsomething I was also worried about. Looks like I was more or less\nright.\"\n\n\"Why, what's wrong?\"\n\n\"Nothing really bad,\" Gefty assured her. He added, \"I think. But take a\nlook at the Federation dateline.\"\n\nKerim peered at the screen, frowned. \"But ...\"\n\n\"Uh-huh.\"\n\n\"Why, that ... that's almost ...\"\n\n\"That,\" Gefty said, \"or rather _this_ is the day after we started out\nfrom the Hub, headed roughly Galactic west. Three weeks ago. We'd be\njust past Miam.\" He knuckled his chin. \"Interesting thought, isn't it?\"\n\nKerim was silent for long seconds. \"Then they ... or we ...\"\n\n\"Oh, they're us, all right,\" Gefty said. \"They'd have to be, wouldn't\nthey?\"\n\n\"I suppose so. It seems a little confusing. But I was thinking. If you\nsend them a transmitter call ...\"\n\nGefty shook his head. \"The _Queen's_ transmitter isn't too hot, but it\nmight push a call as far as Evalee. Then we could arrange for a Com-Web\nlink-up there, and in another ten minutes or so ... but I don't think\nwe'd better.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" Kerim demanded.\n\n\"Because we got through it all safely, so we're going to get through it\nsafely. But if we receive that message now and never go on to Maulbow's\nmoon ... you see? There's no way of knowing just what would happen.\"\n\nKerim looked hesitant, frowned. \"I suppose you're right,\" she agreed\nreluctantly at last. \"So Mr. Maulbow will have to stay dead now. And\nthat janandra.\" After a moment she added pensively, \"Of course, they\nweren't really very nice--\"\n\nGefty shivered. One of the things he'd learned from Maulbow's ravings\nwas the real reason he and Kerim had been taken along on the trip. He\ndidn't feel like telling Kerim about it just yet, but it had been solely\nbecause of Maulbow's concern for his master's creature comforts. The\njanandra could go for a long time without food, but after fasting for\nseveral years on the moon, a couple of snacks on the homeward run would\nhave been highly welcome.\n\nAnd the janandra was a gourmet. It much preferred, as Maulbow well knew,\nto have its snacks still wriggling-fresh as it started them down its\ngullet.\n\n\"No,\" Gefty said, \"I couldn't call either of them really nice.\"\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Analog_ September 1962.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
